ROSSETTI’S HOUSE IN CHEYNE WALK, CHELSEA.
LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE.
/"\NCE known as Lindsay Road, Cheyne Walk is on the left bank
of the Thames, and much of its eighteenth-century picturesque-
ness still remains. Rich in historical, literary and artistic associa-
tions, Cheyne Walk possesses a peaceful atm'osphere which has
attracted many notable residents. In the house numbered 16,
iurmounted in the Queen’s day by a figure of Mercury, Dante
Gabriel Rossetti, famous both as poet and as painter, spent the
last eighteen years of his life. At No. 4, Cheyne Walk, once the
residence of the portrait painter Daniel Maclise, George Eliot lived
for a few months, and here, in 1880, she died. No. 119, at the
western end of the thoroughfare, was the last home of J. M. W.
Turner.

THE LETTERS OF A GIANT.
The first thing that must strike anyone
reading Streeton’s letters to Tom Roberts,
edited by R. H. Croll and published by
Ure Smith Pty., under the title Smike to
Bulldog, is their liveliness, their vigor
physical and mental. Cezanne’s letters,
published a year or so ago, were ex-
cessively dull, and the artist continually
complained of his own “stupidity” ; but
here —in one of the early letters —there
are warmth and certainty and passion, the
richness of a lyric by McCrae;
Oh, the long hot day! Oh, the gift of
appreciation! a
I sit on our hill of gold, on the north
side; the wind seems suhburnt and fiery
as it runs through my beard. Yes, rather,
see, look here: north-east the very long
divide is beautiful, warm blue, far, far
away, all dreaming and remote. Now to
the east a little. A great, round cloud of
smoke rises slowly up over the dreamy
horizon into the soft, sweet eastern sky,
then, reaching the wind, floats gently south
like a stream of Turkey lollie or spiders’
threads, making dim and large the long,
majestic Dandenong Ranges.
Yes, I sit here in the upper circle sur-
rounded by copper and gold, and smile joy
under my fly-net as all the light, glory and
quivering brightness passes slowly and
freely before my eyes. Nothing happier
than this. I shout and laugh at my
immense wealth, all free and without re-
sponsibility. Yes, come and share my
riches, they are daily instalments from
heaven. I counted ’em all to-day; there’s
that long hill who looked for gold dust
this morning and got it wrapped in smiles
from the sun, my good friend in heaven.
I lay and watched the evening bow to him.
Such rosy grace I never saw. ’Tis well the
noon did not see her.
Now -’tis 11 p.m., and starry outside.
I’m alone with my thought, and really we
do enjoy ourselves in our room You
enquire after my Bathers. I have a little
bother (model, etc.), but I’ll try and bring
it up healthy and strong in the way it
should go.
There were giants in Australia in those
days! How different it all is—“healthy
and strong in the way it should go”—
from the art that tries its hardest to be
sickly and disgusting! And how different,
too, from that wretched conception of
Australia that finds this great hot land
drab, repellent, “melancholy”! Streeton,
like “Banjo” Paterson, found in Australia
“the vision splendid of the sunlit plains
extended”; drought, even, and the desert
—he took it all in his stride.
Somehow J want to be at it.
I picture in my head the Murray and
all the wonder and glory at its source up
toward Kosciusko (Meyer wrote a lovely
description of it), and the great gold plains,
and all the beautiful inland Australia, and
I love the thought of walking into all this
and trying to expand and express it in my
way. I fancy large canvases all glowing
and moving in the happy light and others
bright, decorative and chalky and expres-
sive of the hot trying winds and the slow
immense summer. It is immense, and
drought and cracks in the earth, and creeks
all baked mud.
In another letter he speaks of “sarsapar-
illa twisting her purple strength round
everything” and says that “Philistines
from the old country” are blind to it.
There was this great, robust Australian-
ism in him ; and there was nothing crude,
uncultivated, “colonial” about it. He
painted not only from a full heart but
from a mind steeped in poetry. He knew
literature ; not very widely, perhaps—and
certainly with lapses of taste (he admired
the death of Little Nell) —but well enough
to stamp him a man of genuine culture.
He praised Dickens, Kipling, Olive
Schreiner, Wordsworth ; said of the girl
he afterwards married that she was “well
read in all poetry” and “would have been
a fit companion for Keats”; he wrote
from London;
Before me my economical little fire, with
its cheerful glow, my feet stretched to the
mantel, where are Jane Eyre, Chatterton,
Sonnets, and Wuthering Heights by Bronfe
—a wonderful book.
“Sir,” said Dr. Johnson, “has he litera-
ture?” Streeton had. More, he had
vision ; not only his robust concept of
Australia but something profound and
mystical for one of his letters shows a
deep and delicate poetry that one would
expect from Gruner rather than from
Streeton:
Am doing a little work at Coogee
The ocean is a big wonder, Bulldog. What
a great miracle. It’s hard to comprehend
it, like death and sleep. The slow, immense
movement of this expanse moves one very
strongly. You’re made to clutch the rocks
and be delighted, a dreadful heaving and
soft eternity.
After sunset ’twas a silver ocean to-night
All people had gone to wait for the train,
and I came down slowly in the dusk, and,
close to me, watching also, was a little
girl of about 10 sitting on the sand, so still.
I stood a while thinking of her and the
great spread of water, and I felt very much
inclined to take this dear little creature in
my arms and kiss her, sit down next her,
so innocent, and who may some day be-
come a fine woman. She may be powerful
like this broad water some day.
Which shows, incidentally, that there
were the makings of a good prose writer
in Streeton. His descriptions of the paint-
ing of “Fire’s On” are almost as exciting
as the masterpiece itself:“The tunnel’s
mouth gapes like a great dragon’s mouth
at the perfect flood of hot sunlight....
The rock is a perfect blazing glory of
white, orange, cream and blue streaks
here and there where the blast has worked
its force.”
One would like to leave it at that—
Streeton in his “perfect blazing glory.”
And, in the long run, it is the right way
to leave him.
Certainly, he couldn’t keep it up. The
letters —as was also, on the whole, the
case with his later paintings—lose their
buoyancy after his visit to England.
Dignity, something of grandeur always re-
main, but not thQ passion for art and life
and Australia that makes one think in the
early letters that Streeton had swallowed
the sun. Mr. Croll includes an un-
published criticism by M. J. MacNally
accusing the painter of commercialism ;
there is a very strange letter from Streeton
to Tom Roberts defending himself from
a charge of lack of generosity to his
contemporaries—and nowhere in the book
is there a reference by Streeton to Gruner.
Here, and in his attacks on Julian Ashton,
Streeton seems, at best, to have been
the victim of parochialism—Melbourne
versus Sydney. Indeed, the book tails
away so badly that one wonders whether,
in its present -form, it was quite worth
publishing. A selection of all Streeton’s
letters, with a fuller commentary and
biography, would surely have made a
more readable volume.
Still, Mr. Croll’s notes are interesting
as far as they go; the early letters are
fascinating and, with seven of Streeton’s
paintings reproduced in color, a Conder oil
in color and a number of Streeton and
Roberts canvases in half-tone plates, the
book is attractively put together. And,
take him all round, Streeton does emerge
from it as a giant. In the last letter
of the collection you find him complain-
ing of a heatwave but at the same time
he reminds himself —and the reader —that
when he painted “the Hawkesbury River
canvas” (presumably “The Purple Noon’s
Transparent Might”) the temperature was
106 degrees, “and on the first days of
painting 108 in the shade.” Painting a
masterpiece of beauty and splendor with
the temperature at 108 degrees, and with
a line from Shelley as the title —that is
the real Streeton, and that is the mag-
nificent tradition of Australian art he
helped to found.
Saint Imagines.
From what appears to be the most
authentic account of some part of his
earthly career— Twelve Tales of the Life
and Adventures of Saint Imaginus, edited
by Frances Margaret McGuire, illustrated
by Betty Arnott and published by Sheed
and Ward—it seems that little is known
of the early life of Australia’s first and
only recognised (maybe that should be
recognisable) saint.
A steadying example of Australian
casualness. After all, even Adelaide —
somewhere near which, with excursions
elsewhere, Imaginus qualified for his
place in hagiography, or, at any rate, in
the hierarchy of Australian fictional
characters—can hardly have so many of
his kind, for all its abundance of
churches, that it can rest satisfied with
knowing merely that “He seems to have
been, born' of good though respectable
parents and to have spent his boyhood in
the country.”
A pilgrimage of search and inquiry
would seem to be called for; such as
Alec H. Chisholm made to the same
landscape in the boyhood tracks of C. J.
Dennis, discovering, among other lively
trove, that “Den’s” father was a sailor
who gave up the sea to, as the pleasing
phrase runs, keep a pub, and that maiden
aunts, presuming to deputise for Destiny,
carried off young Clarrie far from the
sounds of rustic conviviality and dripping
beer-taps, and did their darndest to turn
him into a proper little ciss. Perhaps
Imaginus didn’t have any maiden aunts,
or he, too, may have grown up to roman-
ticise the cop-bashers of Little Lon., and
eventually to join the staff of Melbourne
“Herald.”
Instead, Imaginus, as is declared with
classic understatement on the dust-jacket,
became “a saint whom it is easier to
admire than to imitate.” Whether or not
he is to be admired for one of his various
achievements, he certainly cannot be
imitated in it; he invented cricket.
Once he helped a broke stockbroker to
make 30,000 pounds. He had gone to
the stockbroker to raise some of the
wind towards setting up a hospice for
the poor, and anybody who has ever
undertaken to get money out of a stock-
broker will probably know that, after a
little conversation, Imaginus went off
feeling very sorry for the unfortunate
broker and proceeded to raise the wind
on his behalf, with extraordinary results.
Another day Imaginus lent his assist-
ance to a young aviator’s guardian angel
who was so perplexed about her charge’s
very worldly behavior that her wings
were drooping and even moulting. “It
is the flying,” she wept when Imaginus
gently questioned her. “I fear so much
that he will crash while in the state of
infidelity that at times I carry the whole
weight of the aeroplane on my own
wings. If only he wouldn’t spin dive!”
Imaginus has his own perplexities—
the miracle he performs of making wheat
grow in the streets so that the poor will
have abundance of bread isn’t at all
popular, even with the poor; and his
giving a mendicant a beautiful pie baked
for the bishop leads to the pie being ex-
changed by the beggar, more thirsty
than hungry, for a bottle of wine, and
by the pub-keeper’s wife for a pair of
stockings and a necklace. But Imaginus
is at all events exceptionally lucky in his
hagiographer, who has that rarest of all
qualities in hagiographers, not unpardon-
ably to mention women writers, a sense
of humor. Further —and this some might
think to have the same dual application
—she has a compactness of style and
narrative method that achieves complete-
ness without inducing the reader to think
either of telegrams or the Nullabor.
No doubt naturally, since they’re con-
cerned with a saint, most of the Tales
conclude with a stated moral. One or
two that do not, or in which the moral
is left implicit (“The Perplexed Angel,”
“The Astonished Stockbroker”), are
model examples of that rare literary
achievement the satisfying cameo short
story. And whatever may be thought of
moralistic writings as literature, it must
be very rarely that morals have been so
charmingly dispensed.
Three "Land” Books.
Having concluded that “The waVe of
efficiency that has swept over our fac-
tories in recent years has reached the
farms and dairies of Australia,” Dr.
Walter Deutsch was apparently swept into
writing Dairy Farming (Assoc. General
Publications, Ltd.), which claims to be “a
modern guidebook for the Australian
dairyfarmer.” He waggles a warning
finger;
It becomes, therefore, increasingly im-
perative for every primary producer to
make a systematic survey of costs of pro-
duction and to analyse his methods of
management and farm operation.
There is a remarkable predilection
among erudite gentlemen for persuading
tired farmers to indulge in these feats —
which are as alien to the farmer as they
are to most other people. The kind of
man at whom this book is aimed is
usually far too busy to bother about
systematic surveys and other peculiar
animals. The author himself, or maybe
his publishers, apparently did a little
systematic surveying of costs, for the 368
pages are interspersed with no fewer than
16 full-page, 13 half-page and 10 quarter-
page advertisements —an idea, which
aspiring authors of fiction will consider
with envy.
However, Dr. Deutsch has made a care-
ful and extensive selection .of the advice
and opinions of well over 50 authorities
at home and abroad, all duly acknow-
ledged.
Another kind of “systematic survey” is
in Alan J. Holt’s Wheat Farms of Vic-
toria. When Mr. Holt turned his atten-
tion to farming it was not the animals or
crops or the pests appertaining there-
unto which attracted him, but the farmer
himself and the farmer’s wife and their
sons and daughters and their habits and
customs and beliefs, even unto the pattern
of their habiliments and support of the
local football team.
Wherefore Mr. Holt went forth into the
Victorian Mallee and hobnobbed with
the inhabitants of the scrub and peered
at them through the dust and dissected
them enthusiastically. And out ,of all this
came his “sociological survey,” published
by and with the backing of the University
of Melbourne. Working on the thesis that
“the agency responsible for the applica-
tion of all this technical farm knowledge,
to wit, the farmer, has not been studied
at all,” Mr. Holt captured a few speci-
mens, shoved ’em under his microscope
and examined everything about them
from their spinal rigidity to their ultimate
thought extravagances.
There is plenty about yields and acre-
ages and sidelines and share-farming and
sand and scrub and all that, and there is
a lot more about the humans concerned.
Mr. Holt asked them all sorts of ques-
tions, from “What time do you get up
in mid-autumn or mid-spring?” to “How
do you get on with your neighbor?” and
he received the kind of answer he might
have expected to receive from sunburned
Australians battling against pretty well
every device that man and nature could
bring against them. He found out the
percentages of religious sects, political
parties, loafers, good and bad farmers,
beer-drinkers, football barrackers, rabbit-
eaters, bankrupts, donors to show societies
and local hospitals, holiday-makers,
humorists, optimists and pessimists and
he’s got it all in covers, a not inconsider-
able feat and probably a valuable one,
since his findings are convincingly tabu-
lated and supported by such impressive
evidence as this:
One suggestion for measuring the farmer s
interest in his farm was to note whether
the farmer has given it a name. Only 43
p.c. of the farms had names... .Of the 27
farms with names in the Mallee, six had
“Pine” mentioned in them, e.g.. Pine View,
Pine Grove, Pine Vale, etc. The pine con-
cerned on one property was a very sad-
looking tree bent at an angle of about
45 degrees.... Many have a somewhat wist-
ful quality, such as Glen Valley, Newavon
Dale, Holmwood, Heatherlea. Others are,
on the other hand, more pretentious:
Mowbray Park, Elderslie, Belvedere, Mel-
rose Park.
Mr. Holt doesn’t say so, but one can’t
resist the suspicion that he felt a parti-
cular affection for the cove who, asked
for the name of his farm, replied, “The
Bloody Workhouse! ” Anybody who has
ever cut a springback, travelled the
MurrayviHe line or weathered a Walpeup
duststorm should read Wheat Farms of
Victoria, if only for its nostalgic truths.
Another “land” book is John M.
Fegan’s Merino Wool (Grahame Book
Co.). Mr. Fegan is a Queenslander who
has been among wool all his working life.
When he set out to write Merino Wool,
he intended it to be a “study of its [the
wool’s] characteristics and classing,” and
hoped that it would be of some use to
growers and handlers and to youngsters
just getting into the pastoral industry. He
has succeeded in making a book that
anybody can read with profit,' since it not
only explains in plain language the
chemical structure of wool, but goes
easily thence to descriptions of wools,
the reasons for their variety and the
variety of uses to which wools can be
put, and gently but firmly emphasises
some current mistakes in classing and
methods of correcting them. A sample:
Combing and spinning machines are not
deceived by any disguise which a wool may
adopt externally Manufacturers’ buying
limits are not only fixed at’ different
figures for the same types in various
markets, but wools from certain districts
coming into those markets are marked for
special attention... .An experienced buyer
has, in fact, a knowledge of station brands
and the behavior of those clips in manu-
facture which would surprise many people
who grow wool.
Mr. Fegan hasn’t spared himself in re-
search for the purpose of this book and
he has applied it to his own knowledge
and experience in a manner which suggests
that while studying sheep and wool he
has found time to study the English
language and how to use it as a medium
of expression. Some technical fault has
affected the blocks which illustrate
Merino Wool, a flaw which should be
attended to in the second edition —there is
sure to be a second edition.
For the Freelance.
Australian Writers’ and Artists’ Market,
published by the Australian School of
Journalism and the Art Training Institute,
Melbourne, is frankly concerned with
writing, drawing, song-making, play-
writing anH art in general as a profitable
profession for the freelance.
A hopeful jacket depicts an author in
his shirt-sleeves with his waistcoat un-
buttoned and a pipe in his mouth, sitting
at a typewriter out of which banknotes,
cheques and coins of the realm are pour-
ing. How this end is to be achieved is
described by half a dozen successful ex-
perts and they all write well. One of
them is worth quoting:
In those bitter days [the depression
years], when I had a real and desperate
need of money to pay the rent-collector
and the butcher and all the rest of them,
I made it by writing. I wrote under the
name you see at the head of this piece,
under half a dozen other names, and under
my initials. I wrote about everything under
the sun —articles of general interest, literary
and critical articles and what purported to
be scientific articles. I touched on interior
decoration and women’s fashions. Nothing
escaped my pen. I turned out short stories,
and even verse. I say even verse, because
that’s not my line, and I tried it for one
week only.
He found it an arduous but fascinating
business: “There’s no pleasure as keen
and personal as seeing your stuff in
print and receiving your first cheque. '
This appears to be the first requirement
of the freelance—that he likes it. He
might as well give it up if he doesn’t.
The book contains lists of British,
Canadian, U.S., South African, Austra-
lian and M.L. agents, publishers and
periodicals and lots about radio script
writers, who are the biggest money-
makers.

What are the Australian and M.L. voting
systems ?
Under the preferential system of voting used
in Australia a candidate must receive an abso-
lute majority of votes to be elected. Where
there are more than two candidates and no
candidate receives an absolute majority of the
first preference votes, the candidate with the
fewest votes is excluded and hi? votes trans-
ferred — according to the next preference
marked thereon by the voter —to the remaining
candidates. If there are still more than two
candidates left and none has secured an abso-
lute majority, the process of excluding the
candidate with the lowest number of votes
and the transferring of his votes —according
to the preference indicated. thereon—continues
until one candidate obtains an absolute
majority. By indicating the order of his pre-
ference for all the candidates the voter ensures
his vote is not wasted. In New Zealand the
“first past the post” system of voting is used,
and the candidate who secures the greatest
number of primary votes is elected irrespective
of whether that number constitutes an abso-
lute majority or not.

A method of rendering cotton tape rot-resis-
tant ?
Prepare a tannin solution by filling wooden
barrels with chopped or ground wattle-bark,
cover the bark in one barrel with, water
and allow to stand for a day. Decant the liquid
into another barrel and again allow it to stand
for a day, repeating the process until the ex-
tract is the color of strong tea. Put the wattle-
bark extract into a wooden or earthenware
vessel and draw the cotton tape slowly through
the tannin solution at such a rate that each
section of the tape remains in the solution for
about one minute. Next, using the same
method, pass the tape through a 5 p.c. solution
of copper acetate. Wash thoroughly in run-
ning water to remove excess copper salts and
allow to dry. A simpler method would be to
use the commercial rot-proofing preparation
sold by Hardie Trading Ltd., Melbourne, and
called Hardiproof.

1 have a 32 or 38 Ruston Hornsby suction
gas engine and have been told that these
engines may be fueled with distillate or fuel
oil. Is this correct?
Know of no instance where such a modi-
fication has been effected and doubt whether
it would be advisable on such an old engine.
An alternative would be to convert the engine
to the diesel principle of compression ignition,
but here again it is not considered that the
engine is designed to stand up to the high
pressures that would be involved in this method.
If petrol is used to run the unit, and the
carburettor and spark-plug ignition is used,
it will run satisfactorily, though it may be
necessary to reduce the compression pressure
by machining the foot of the connecting rod.

Who are the boxers now recognised as world
champions in every division? What are their
nationalities? From whom, where and when
did they win the titles ?
Heavyweight, American negro Joe Louis;
light-heavyweight, Russian-American Gus Les-
nevich; middleweight, Polish-American Tony
Zale; welterweight, Italian-American Marty
Servb, although the New York Boxing Comirps-
sion has relieved Servo of the title because Df
his many refusals to meet American negro Ray
Robinson, and conferred it on Robinson.
Lightweight title is disputed by two American
negroes, Ike Williams and Bob Montgomery.
United States National Boxing Association
recognises Williams as champion, and New
York Boxing Commission claims Montgomery
holds the title. Italian-American Willie Pep
(real name William Papaleo) is undisputed
world’s featherweight champion; Mexican
Manuel Ortiz holds bantamweight title; and
Scotchman Jackie Paterson is flyweight cham-
pion. Louis won heavyweight championship
from James J. Braddock (knockout eighth
round) at Chicago on June 22, 1937; Lesnevich
became light-heavyweight title holder when he
defeated Tami Mauriello (points, 15 rounds)
in New York on August 26, 1941; Zale de-
feated A1 Hostak (knockout 13th round) for
•middleweight laurels at Seattle on ,June 19,
1940; Pep outpointed Chalky Wright (15
rounds), and won featherweight championship
in New York on November 20, 1942; Ortiz
beat Lou Salica (points, 12 rounds) for bantam-
weight title at Hollywood, Cal., on August' 7,
1942; Paterson won flyweight championship
from Peter Kane (knockout first round) at
Glasgow on June 19, 1943.
Brief Answers.
N.McI.: It was a mistake not to treat the cat
for tapeworms when you received the direc-
tions. The remedy is freshly-ground areca nut
(one grain per lib. weight of animal) and the
cat should be starved for 24 hours before
dosing. Make a pill by mixing the nut with
a little butter and administer from one dessert-
spoonful to one tablespoon of castor oil an
hour after the pill has been taken. In a further
two hours give some warm milk. The drug is
not dangerous, but it should only be repeated
if necessary... .A.L.: (1) Not advisable to
breed, as brother and sister is too close a
. relationship. The best time for breeding is

It shone on the sea

A RIVER OF GOLDEN GRAIN
that How on RURRER!
On the level straight up in the
air for 100 feet down through
huge storage bins until it finally
emerges 95 feet aboye the sea to
flood into the holds of waiting ships
this river of grain flows on
Rubber Belts at a steady speed of
64,000 bushels per hour.
That is the modern way of handling
grain at the huge storage terminal
of the Grain Elevator Board at
Geelong. What a contrast to the
old “wheat lumping” days when
the grain was laboriously handled
in bags 3 bushels at a time! .
To advise on the problem of the
swift and efficient handling of such
vast quantities of grain, Dunlop
Technicians were called in and
finally installed some 21,000 feet
(just on 4 miles) of Dunlop Con-
veyor and Elevator Belting made
specially for the job; 215 Dunlop
Wedgropes were also installed for
power transmission.
The installation is so planned that
it is possible for one man from a
central control room, to operate the
whole plant or any part of it
throughout the huge structure.
From the development of thousands
of special Rubber Products like this
Dunlop have built a reputation as
Australia’s leading rubber manu-
facturers. Perhaps you have a
problem that may be answered by
rubber. If so we suggest you write
DUNLOP RUBBER AUSTRALIA LIMITED (INC. IN VIC.)
to the Dunlop Technical Service Department
in the capital city of your State. No
problem is too small and no one is better
equipped to provide the help you may need.

CHAMPION OF THE VALLEY
By Cecil Mann
WHEN the news of it got about the
arrival of Whiskers was instantly
recognised by all as something
extraordinary. One of a litter of
seven purebred pointers, the other six of
which were the expected normal and
natural liver-and-white, his patches were
—it could have been ominously—a posi-
tive black, and there was no such color
scheme on one side or the other of the
litter’s pedigree breeding.
Moreover, by what his expert, if
astounded, owner, Mr. Andrew Nolan,
considered an infallible sign, the black-
and-white one gave instant promise of
being the pick of the litter. The sign
was that, when the mother lay down to
suckle them, the infant Whiskers not
only sucked with exceptional vim, but he
vigorously roughed the others aside in
order to get at it.
In putting these facts on record in the
“Star,” editor Kirwan noted also the
circular black patch completely surround-
ing the pup’s right eye, giving him an
expression part-comic and part, Mr.
Kirwan confessed, indescribable ; remind-
ing Mr. Nolan —“in jocular vein,” the re-
port said —of the
black eyes he him-
self had collected
on various occa-
sions back in his
fighting days, and
of the beauty he
gave Snowy Pearce
in one of his fights
for the heavy-
weight champion-
ship of the Valley
in the old Red
Room that used to
be over Marconti’s and Samovar’s
Restaurant.
Mr. Nolan, editor Kirwan also took
the occasion to inform the “Star’s” more
modern readers, had eventually retired
undefeated; and Mr. Kirwan was im-
pelled to wonder where there were
fighters of that quality today. Had he
had the gift of prophecy he might have
stated that there was. one there in the
making under his very eyes, wearing
already an insigne of the profession.
Certainly it would seem that Whiskers
started out in the first place under some
special sign. Just whose sign might per-
haps be an open question, though every-
body who came to know him had no
doubt whatever about that. They would
have agreed unanimously with the wife of
Mr. Patrick Deans of the corner butcher’s
shop.
“The divvil himself,” Mrs. Deans de-
clared, “is in that black-and-white vil-
lain. Haven’t I seen him myself in broad
daylight trailin’ a length of sausages along
the street!”
“They were not my sausages,” said
Patrick. “The wonder is he survived.”
GIVING the devil his due —if it is his
due —it must be said that he did
make a thoroughly good job of Whiskers.
As he developed, he shed his early
noviciate crudity and became, as it
were, by profession a public brawler,
common thief, killer and marauding
vagabond at large.
Two cattledogs, a breed till then para-
mount as fighters in the Valley, each paid
for sparring indiscretions with their
lives. Others got off perhaps more
lightly, but the most rash of them never
challenged Whiskers again.
This, and other, reprehensible, not to
say immoral, behavior has no doubt been
chalked up by the Recording Angel on
the account of Whiskers. But a great
deal worse will also have been entered
up against him. It will be shown that,
himself corrupt. Whiskers was a prolific
producer of corruption in others ; so that
the Recorder, on the Great Judgment
Day, can be imagined as finding the
Whiskers entries among the longest in his
book. And one of the first he could come
upon, of the more heinous sort, would
be:
“Nolan, Eva. Occupation, domestic
duties. Church, Presbyterian. Age at
offence, 36.”
Turning to the pages indicated, the
Recorder will come upon the grievous
picture of Eva tempted. In that picture
Mrs. Nolan will be seen as a hale and
robust but nonetheless very neatly-
moulded figure of womanhood. Height,
just about as it should be ; face, rounded
and pleasant, with brown hair and very
“Champion of the Valley” is an
extract from “Light in the Valley,”
a novel by Cecil Mann shortly to be
published by Dymock’s, Ltd. It has
been altered and abridged for publi-
cation here so that it may be read
as a short story, complete in itself.
Another extract, similarly re-
arranged as a short story, will also
be published in “The Bulletin” in
the near future, under the title “Old
Rosy.”
soft and sympathetic brown eyes. She will
be seen standing just inside her open
kitchen window; her expression, the Re-
corder will be pleased to note, that of a
good woman disturbed by surprise and
uncertainty.
On the back verandah outside the
window will be seen the malevolently
evil-looking Whiskers. He will be seen
to be rather unconvincingly simulating
innocence. His huge head, with its black
moustache and black eye, held high in a
state of evil ecstasy; his long tail
flogging the air from side to side. He
will be looking up expectantly, some-
thing very like a leer in his black eye; an
expression of triumph all over his sinister
countenance; and in his big, Cerberus
mouth, held most lightly, an excellent
plump dressed fowl.
Having, it may be reasonably pre-
sumed, a lightning-quick eye and ear for
such detail, .the Recorder would note the
change coming over Mrs. Nolan’s agree-
able round face and the low, conspiri-
torial tone of her voice ;
“Now, where did you get that, you
black mischief? Here, give it to me at
once. Oh, you’re a wicked thief,
Whiskers. You’ll be the ruin of us all!”
Then Eva Nolan’s shapely body lean-
ing but over the windowsill; taking in
her hands the nicely-prepared bird
thieved by the corrupt creature outside
from some —no doubt by that time
highly indignant—unfortunate neighbor’s
kitchen.
Being meticulous in that virtue which
is rightly held to be next to godliness,
especially in a housewife, Mrs. Eva Nolan
washed the bird thoroughly in hot water.
To be wholly on the safe side she rinsed
it then, inside and out, in vinegar, before
putting it into the big wood-buming stove
to be getting partly baked while she was
dressing herself for the meeting of the
Presbyterian Ladies’ Working Bee at the
Manse.
At this stage in his entry the Recorder
should come upon a note written by his
assistant lady Recorder to the effect that
Eva bathed and powdered her firmly-
modelled form and that she stood for a
few moments admiring its graceful con-
tours in the long hall mirror on the way
from bathroom to bedroom. The
ardency of His Highness the Sun having
been that day warmly evident, she (Eva)
had then dressed in a sensible minimum
of variously-shaped and contrived pieces
of silk, such as stockings, etc., with black
kid shoes, a frock of the same color, with
laurel-green lapels and a black-and-green
hat modelled in the shape of a coy
bonnet.
Back again to his own firm handwrit-
ing, the Recorder would have the picture
of Eva transported by her quite capable
legs to the Manse, where he would next
note her fluttering quite a lot, for such a
quiet and modest housewife, on meeting
the new young clergyman, who had at
that time arrived for a rest from mis-
sioning in the heathen Pacific islands.
The Recorder could not overlook, either,
even more agitated fluttering over what,
in all honesty, he could hardly set down
as anything other than a lingering hand-
shake.
This, for her, quite exciting interlude
over, and the business of the meeting
done with, Eva returned home again.
There, having changed into the blue-and-
white house - frock which Andrew
especially liked, and which always
seemed to make him like her all the
better when he saw her in it, she got the
fire going in the stove again and pro-
ceeded with her unfinished cooking.
And when Andrew that evening shut
up the shop for the night and came home
Eva gave unto him of her cooking, with
an accompaniment of fresh green peas
from the garden and baked halves of
potatoes and brown gravy; and he did
eat.
ALL therein being, a model of perfect
fairness, it will of course be set down
in the Recorder’s list that there was much
to the credit of Mrs. Nolan, vis-a-vis
the monstrous Whiskers, offsetting what
may there be found debited against her
other self, Eva. A four-pounds cut of
bacon which Whiskers had brought home
she returned, with apologies, to its owner,
who was a friend of hers, and whose
name could still be made out in pencil in
grocer Wm, Streeting’s handwriting on
the golden-brown rind. A sponge cake,
for all the tenderness of the careful grip
Whiskers had had on it, had his big teeth
marks’sunk deep into it and was wet with
his slobber, and so was, after all, only
fit to be thrown to the Malay Games,
which uncMistian and battle-marked
birds enjoyed it very much, without paus-
ing to question whether eating it was
putting their souls in jeopardy.
For other stray booty of Whiskers’
zeal and skill Mrs. Nolan had Andrew
nail a box on the front fence, so that
any passers-by could see what had been
“found” and help themselves to their be-
longings. The deposits included from
time to time a lady’s green woollen
swimming costume, too small for Mrs.
(Eva) Nolan; a pair of white shoes, also
on the small side; a boy’s dart-gun; a
towel branded N.S.W. Government Rail-
ways ; and a score or two other such un-
wanted odds and ends.
A nice length of No. 8 gut line Andrew
considered —with the school jewy then in
the river—too liable to tempt some con-
scienceless passer into claiming a fictitious
ownersMp, and so added it to his own
basket. But altogether the box on the
front fence by the footpath, while it did
nothing to improve the general opinion
of Whiskers, served to keep intact Andrew
Nolan’s notably Mgh repute.
It has all no doubt been set down long
since against Whiskers in the Recorder’s
lists; nor will it be found there that that
evil one led his victims merely singly into
corruption. In the case of Rex v. Mc-
Ginty, his total bag had been three.
There was, to begin with, Billy Mc-
Ginty Mmself. A disreputable fellow,
Billy, even before WMskers was born or
ever thought of. When Billy was noticed
to be visiting Town, housewives kept a
closer eye on their washing. His appear-
ance about Town in day-time—especi-
ally by afternoon, when he would some-
how have got a zig-zag lurching into his
barefoot gait—was both a disgrace to
himself and an embarrassment to all,' tMs
last because of Billy’s careless habit of
forgetting to do up all Ms buttons.
Billy—there were less polite names for
him, as there were for Whiskers —had
been walking along the street towards
Gillam’s Hotel rehearsing Ms lines aloud:
“Berry hard one to catch, that fella,
Mr. Gillam. He worth his weight in
rum, eh?”
Trotting footloose through the town,
WMskers, in passing, casually grabbed
the four-pound perch dangling from
Billy’s hooked black fingers, and broke
into a gallop over the street and on to
the bridge, heading for home.
What Billy was subsequently charged
with saying was considered worth 48
hours in the lock-up, so it might be a dis-
cretion to omit it here. It can be read
by the curious in the C.P.S. office and it
will not be overlooked that it was uttered
in the presence of women, which natur-
ally makes a lot of difference.
In the final Recorder’s list it can no
doubt be expected to be set down, as it
is not at the C.P.S. office, that actually
there was not the sight of a woman witMn
50 yards of Billy at the time. It might
be inscribed in that other list in especially
fiery ink that Sergeant Shale just threw
the women in for good measure or from
force of habit. In either case, if perjury
is regarded by the Recorder as it ought
to be, the old Sergeant will be for it.
Thomas Curley, J.P., witnessed the
arrest of Billy from Ms desk near the
stack of pumpkins and bags of maize in
his auctioneer and estate agency office.
Mr. Curley may have been deficient in
some things—hair on his head, for in-
stance ; or anything nearer to masculine
beauty than may be found in a Mghly
red, parrot-like face —blit he was not one
to have missed the presence of a woman
of any description had there been such
a treasure in sight.
However, an observant man in other
ways also, Mr. Curley, J.P., noticed on
his way into the Court House that the
boxthorn hedge outside was badly in need
of clipping, and from past experience he
knew that it always took Billy McGinty
two days to clip it. In the.»circumstances
he did not question the veracity of Ser-
geant Shale, nor hesitate in giving Billy
48 hours to sharpen the Court House
clippers and get to work. So, if injustice
also carries the weight it should, Mr.
Curley will be another to get it in the
neck.
And that evil monster Whiskers Nolan,
killer of poultry in the night, thief, cor-
rupter and public brawler, responsible
for all of it. The Recorder will know
him on sight by the double brand of
Cain on his brazen forehead, no less than
by the black eye of evil encircled there.
The double brand for the killing of his
own kind. And if Andrew Nolan should
arise to plead for him that he killed those
fellow creatures and maimed the sundry
others in fair fight, will it not-be possible
to remind Andrew that there is a third
mark on that forehead, and ask him what
he knows about it? That would set Mr.
Andrew Nolan, respectable citizen, back
a little.
Dr. Hughes found that Mr. Thomas
Curley, J.P., who, as the “Star” was a
little later to record, passed away with
tragic suddenness in his business office,
succumbed to heart failure. §
No doubt that was true; as who
wouldn’t succumb if knocked over with
the suddenness that Mr. Curley had been
by nearly a hundredweight of black-and-
white fury activated by nothing more pro-
voking to himself than a rat seen scam-
pering across the street-level floor from
the stack of bagged maize at Mr. Curley’s
back?
That Mr. Curley, J.P., was at the time
engrossed in the passing spectacle of a
young lady in a nicely-cut, sunlit floral
skirt might or might not carry weight in
the final finding. But that, perhaps,
might not apply to the fact that Andrew
Nolan saw fully what there happened,
and stayed mum.
But that reputable citizen Mr. Nolan
did not come forward and give the true
circumstances of the sudden passing of •
Mr. Curley, J.P., should not be hastily ’
ascribed to mere callousness. As far as
Mr. Curley was con-
cerned it could have
served no useful pur-
pose, but it could
have meant as sudden
an end being put to
Whiskers as a public
menace. And there
was a great deal more
in Andrew’s attach-
ment to that lawless
familiar of his than
the usual companion-
ship between man and
dog.
•I N the general view of him as an estim-
-1 able citizen with a grand past, Andrew’s
repute stood as Mgh as any man’s in
the Valley, as Andrew himself stood
physically as Mgh as most men. “As
game as Andy Nolan” was as good as a
proverb; and everybody knew the shape
of his broken nose, the rocklike square
jaw, the stitch-marked scar instead of an
eyebrow over the right eye. All knew
his tall, big-shouldered figure, the grey
cap he wore winter and summer alike,
and the brown leather jacket in the in-
side of which he had had made a deep
narrow pocket, to hold, as if it were some
sort of talisman, an Sin. length of
hickory stick.
Even to those who had not known him
in his great fighting days, an aura of his
past achievements in the ring glowed
around Andrew’s big bearlike figure,
that animalistic impression chiefly pro-
duced by the leather-jacketed sloped
shoulders and by arms so long that Ms
big hands hung down about his knees.
For all that apparent ungainliness,
Andrew had been in his day every bit
the redoubtable fighter that editor Kir-
wan had acclaimed him to have been.
There was still a remarkable quickness

UNCALED ADDITIONS
RUSSIA WANTS —WHAT?
The question has been given an increas-
ing importance and attention in American
newspapers. “Collier’s” has had a series
of articles asking “What’s Russia Up
To?” and the N.Y. “Sun” poses the ques-
tion “What Is Russia’s Game?” There
seems to be general agreement, in a de-
pressingly negative manner, that “she does
not want war,” though the assertion loses
a good deal of its effectiveness and
strength by being too much protested and
that rather more hopefully than emphati-
cally.
David Lawrence, writing in the N.Y.
“Sun,” says that “the biggest of the un-
answered questions in the U.S. is related
to the intentions of Russia.”
Why, he asks, does she “interpose ob-
jections to whatever *the U.S. and Great
Britain suggest, and why do the Soviet
authorities sanction the firing on our
military ’planes in Austria and vicinity?
Why does she back the Communists in
China and why is she harassing the U.S.
both in the Far East and in Europe?”
Lawrence provides an answer in “a
significant theory advanced in various
quarters that Russia’s real purpose is to
drive the U.S. out of Europe and out of
the Far East. By making life miserable
for our Ambassadors and Ministers the
Russians may convince the American
people that the alternative could mean
war. The Russian reasoning may be that
if the American people can be provoked
into disgust with everything international
withdrawal from Europe and Asia would
follow.”
It would seem, with isolationism popu-
larly discredited during the war, a trans-
parent and vain scheme, but Lawrence is
of the opinion that “if that is Russia’s
game, there may be plausibility in her
method, for the people of the United
States seem to be less inclined to make
sacrifices for the preservation of peace
than they were a year ago. There is
already too much talk of reducing arma-
meiss and of giving Russia a free hand
in Europe.”
Frank Gervasi, in “Collier’s,” looks to
other reasons for Russian actions.
“Soviet foreign policy,” he says, “is
avowedly to secure Russia’s frontiers
against possible future attacks. But to
the people of the Western democracies
Soviet behavior smacks of imperialism.
Actually it is a resumption by the Soviets
of a policy nearly 500 years old.”
He inquires into the historical back-
ground of the “new” policy, and brings
its history up to date: “A succession of
Tsars used it to produce one of the
greatest empires, through the 15th and
18th centuries, that the world has ever
known. At its high noon it contained
Finland, bulged hugely into Europe with
Poland and Bessarabia, dominated Bul-
garia, clamped around the Black Sea,
overhung China like a colossus and
reached to Port Arthur. In its making,
no alliance was too onerous nor any war
too costly for Russia’s rulers.
“After the collapse of the League of
Nations’ collective-security system Russia,
which historically had never known a
friendly neighbor, reverted to the policy
of the Tsars. The Soviets, too, sought
to reach the Baltic, reopen the Darda-
nelles and re-establish themselves in the
Orient. They, like the Tsars, found their
friends where they could. When, in
1939, Hitler was completing his plans for
establishing an empire that would ‘en-
dure 1000 years,’ he thought of the
powerful country to the east. He knew
that Russia had failed to make an alliance
with France and Great Britain against
Germany. He knew that Premier Stalin
had asked a high price—the Baltic States,
‘readjustment’ of Russia’s frontiers with
Poland and freedom of the Dardanelles.
The price was too high for the British,
who had guaranteed the territorial in-
tegrity of Poland and the other small
States involved. But Hitler had no inhi-
bitions. He informed Stalin that Ger-
many was prepared to recognise the
primary Soviet interests from the Baltic
to the Black Sea.
“Hitler and Stalin failed to agree on the
exact frontiers of their empires. Hitler
was willing to give the Soviets the Baltic
States, eastern Poland, Bessarabia and
other bits and pieces. But he balked at
allowing the Russians to have Finland,
bases in Bulgaria and bases and control
in the region of the Dardanelles. Sub-
sequently, the Soviets obtained far more
from the Allies (and with Allied military
assistance) than from Hitler. The Tehran
Conference, in November, 1943, gave
Russia a western frontier as deep into
Europe as it owned at its imperial zenith.
It acknowledged Russian aspirations in
regard to Finland and the Baltic States,
conceded Bessarabia and recognised
Russian spheres of influence in Yugo-
slavia and Bulgaria,”
Gervasi finds the present Russian de-
mand for bases in the Dardanelles —the
same demand that Hitler refused—“the
biggest bone of contention between the
U.S.S.R. and the Western democracies.”
Russia says it wants to make certain it
will not be attacked, but they cannot see
“where security ends and imperialism be-
gins. While they might understand
Russia’s desire to regain eastern Poland
and to control the long-sought Baltic
coast, to have Bessarabia and to possess
a Pacific outlet at Port Arthur, they are
disturbed by Russia’s predominance in
the internal affairs of Bulgaria and Yugo-
slavia, its manoeuvres in Iran and its in-
sistence on bases in the Dardanelles and
on trusteeships in Mediterranean areas
like Tripolitania.”
In Gervasi’s view “there is no visible
economic basis for Russia’s expansionism.
Russia, as it stood before World War 11,
minus the Baltic States, eastern Poland
and Bessarabia, contained all of the
natural wealth it needed to feed and em-
ploy its upward of 180,000,000 people.
Its agricultural areas were already vast.
The country covers a good seventh of the
whole earth’s surface. The Soviets could
not want more land to farm. Theirs is
not an overcrowded, land-poor country.
Russia also already had most of the raw
materials required for modern industry
except rubber and tin and, perhaps, a
sufficiency of oil, although it contains
within its old frontiers more potential oil
sources than any other single country in
the world.”
Thus, he declares, “the knowledge of
Russia’s self-sufficiency causes people to
ask what Russia is up to in Europe, the
Middle East and the Orient. Why, they
want to know, does Russia meddle in the
internal affairs of all its neighbors and
demand a say-so in the private business
of countries like Hungary and Austria,
which aren’t its neighbors? Why does it
insist on forts in the Dardanelles and yell
for parts of Turkey and push into Iran?
Must it have a privileged position in
Asia? It didn’t contribute much to the
defeat of the Japs!”
Since Roosevelt’s death and the end of
the war, he finds, “America has become
increasingly diffident towards Russia.
That diffidence has been translated into
a toughening of American policy. The
hardening of American policy wasn’t the
cause of Russian expansionism but the
result. The Russians and their sympa-
thisers beg to be ‘understood,’ but so do
the democracies.
“Great Britain and the U.S. are con-
fronted with practically the same dilemma
as faced the Germans in their dealings
with the Soviets. Are Britain and
America willing to pay Russia the same
price, for full participation in the United
Nations and the making of a permanent
peace, that Russia once demanded as the
price of making war against Britain?”
Gervasi thinks that “in view of the pos-
sibilities of armed conflict it is necessary
to examine (1) whether Russia desires
war and (2) if it does, whether it could
fight one. Experts agree unanimously
on point number one. The Russian
people, they say, don’t want another war
after having lost at least 6,000,000 and
possibly as many as 15,000,000 dead and
wounded; in World War 11.
“On point number two there are,
thanks to Russia’s policy of secrecy con-
cerning its inner political and economic
life, few facts upon which to base any
conclusions. The almost primitive man-
ner in which Russia fought its battles in
World War II and what reliable infor-
mation reaches Washington indicate that
the Soviet is not at present, and won’t be
for some years to come, in a position to
fight a war. The vast western areas of
the U.S.S.R., normally inhabited by
88,000,000 people, or nearly half Russia’s
population, and producing approximately
60 per cent, of the country’s coal, ferrous
metals and other vital materials, were so
thoroughly devastated by the Germans
that it will take until 1950 at least to re-
habilitate them. Fo£ the next five years
the U.S.S.R.’s industrial and agricultural
energies will be completely occupied with
producing a sufficiency of those bare
necessities required by its long-suffering
population.
“In almost every department of Soviet
civilian industrial production the figures
fall far short of comparable American
figures. In almost every case Soviet pro-
duction is under pre-war levels. In some
of the devastated areas production
generally is down to one-third what it
was before the war.
“The U.S.S.R.’s aggressive economic
policy simply doesn’t fit its relatively
small economic shoes. From this it is easy
to conclude that Russia cannot afford to
have belligerent intentions. Five, ten, 15
or 20 years hence, however, the picture
would change materially if Russia
achieved its empire and organised its eco-
nomic energies into a cohesive and
powerful whole. The Western Powers
would lose what military advantage they
enjoy in possessing the atom bomb. Both
sides have, therefore, less than five years,
and possibly much less time than that —
depending on how soon Soviet scientists
could produce an atomic weapon—in
which to argue out their differences and
devote their energies to producing a per-
manent system for maintaining peace.”
SHADOW OVER THE BALKANS.
The bulk of Russia and the shadow of
a Communist-dominated grouping into a
new satellite republic loom large above
the Balkan States. Seymour Freidin has
reported in the Chicago “Sun” that “the
fusion of Yugoslavia, Albania and Bul-
garia into one federated republic appears
not far distant.”
In such a new State the role of the
Albanian Premier, General Enver Hoxha,
“is not expected to be more than that of
general supernumerary behind Tito and
Georgi Dimitrov, Bulgarian leader and
Soviet favorite of many years’ standing.”
As Freidin saw it “the Albanian-Yugo-
slav pact cemented officially what has
existed for some time, an ideological
—Los Angeles “Times.”
END OF A TRAIL IN THE
BALKANS.
fusion between both countries. The ideo-
logical affinity between Bulgaria and
Yugoslavia has been worked over with
vigor by Government leaders in Belgrade
and Sofia, with emphasis on Slav brother-
hood, and the consolidation could be
achieved without too much trouble poli-
tically when the time is deemed most
propitious. The only difficulty concern-
ing amalgamation of Albania into such
a new State, which would stretch from
the western Danube to the Black Sea and
lie astride Greece and the Mediterranean,
would be orientation of the Albanians.”
Freidin thinks that, “on racial lines,”
that would not be easy. “Nevertheless,
Yugoslavia has managed successfully to
be lined up with Albania on virtually the
same plane as the Soviet is to its fol-
lowers in Belgrade.
“If the fusion is to be implemented, it
is believed that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria
will join first. Under the new Sovietised
Yugoslav constitution, Bulgaria could be-
come a republic with a status like that of
Serbia or any of the other seven republics
now within the federation. It is interest-
ing to note that despite Yugoslav in-
sistence upon reparations from Germany
aifQ Italy, the Belgrade Government virtu-
ally has forgiven claims against Bulgaria,
which, during the war, shared with other
Axis troops in the occupation of Yugo-
slavia. Moreover, Yugoslavia also on
occasion has given tacit approval to Bul-
garia to refrain from paying reparations
to Greece.”
There have been other witnesses to the
trend towards “Sovietisation.” The
“World Report” found “Albania being
developed as an outpost of Russian in-
fluence in the Mediterranean. Russian
technicians are supervising work on
Albanian coastal defences, airfields and
roadways. A Communist Government
controls the country.” It pointed to
Greek fears that “Russia is sponsoring
an anti-Greek Balkan federation.”
Hal Lehrman of Chicago “Sun” be-
lieves that Rumania, too, will be forced
into the new line-up. He found that
country “a colony in Russia’s economic
empire. Through a network of jointly
owned ‘Sovrom’ companies, the Russians
manage all Rumanian air and water trans-
port. They hold a strong interest in
Rumanian banks, the oilfields and refine-
ries, and the steel industry. As the
occupying Power, chief reparations
creditor and dominant member of the
Allied Control Commission, they speak
the last word on every Rumanian trade
deal, foreign or domestic. They buy here
at one third and sell at three times the
world price. Russia also has a political
monopoly. She rules through a puppet
Government moved by Communist
strings.”
One of the most reliable witnesses,
Reuben H. Markham, correspondent for
the “Christian Science Monitor” —“he has
had unique experience in the Balkans,
and no foreigner is more respected, even
loved, in Bulgaria” —was expelled from
Rumania under Russian orders. The
Washington “Post” remarked that “his

expulsion and his account of the Russian-
inspired tyranny in the Balkans show
that all the efforts to assure some degree
of freedom in the Balkans have gone
aglimmering. Mr. Markham reports
that the worst repressions in history are
being matched in Rumania and Bulgaria
today. He supports his charge with
accounts of concentration camps and exe-
cutions ‘in the form of legal massacres.’
Terrorism is practised on non-Com-
munist parties with the view of wiping
out opposition. Mr. Markham is an un-
impeachable witness. He is a valued cor-
respondent of the ‘Christian Science
Monitor,’ a newspaper with the highest
standards of-foreign correspondence.”
On his return to America Markham re-
ported that “the hand of Moscow stretches
far over Rumania, reaching into homes
and factories and fields, filling a nation
with a feeling of helplessness. The people
had a feeling of being in constant danger.
They seemed to believe they had been
placed in a region beyond the law, where
the individual is defenceless, and a man
or woman may be at the mercy of a
foreign empire. The Russians have
seized Rumanian citizens in Rumania and
carried them off to forced labor in
numbers which authentic reports place in
the thousands. This seems to the
Rumanians abduction on an imperial
scale, and though mass deportations have
ceased the political activity of Russians
in every city in the land still reminds all
Government opponents that scores of
thousands of Rumanian citizens are still
working in distant Russian mines. Siberia
hangs as a cloud over the land.”
Markham said, “I do not know
from personal experience whether the
statement of Herbert Morrison, British
Home Secretary, that ‘Communism
is a conspiracy’ applies everywhere.
But on the basis of what I have
seen, I am convinced it does apply
to the Balkans. There Communism seems
to be a political plot, with Communists
using the word ‘democracy’ as a blind.
They constantly rail against Fascists, and
unfortunately in the Balkans a ‘Fascist’
too often merely means a non-Com-
munist.
“Marshal Tito continues largely with-
out bourgeois window dressing and main-
tains in Yugoslavia a regime almost as
completely Communistic as that of
Russia. In Rumania, Bulgaria and
Greece, the Communist methods of using
‘democratic coalitions’ is equally glaring.
“On March 6, 1945, Soviet Vice-Com-
missar Andrei Vishinsky established a
regime of ‘large democratic concentra-
tion’ for Rumania. It is called the
National Democratic Front. In it are
four Socialists, who are accused by other
Socialists of having betrayed their party,
and a number of dissident ‘Liberals,’
whose records deserve scrutiny. Nothing
seems plainer in Rumania than that this
regime is run from Moscow.
“So it is with the Fatherland Front in
Bulgaria, which, the records indicate, was
established at the Soviet Legation in Sofia
as the Red Army was entering Bulgaria.
It contains not a single representative of
a genuine non-Communist party. The
Bulgarian Fatherland Front is one of the
most militant Communist organisations in
the world.
“In no Balkan land is any Communist
and non-Communist ‘democratic front’
anything but an obedient tool of the
Communist party.”
A Plan for the Empire.
A suggestion by G. Swayne-Thomas,
developed for London “Sunday Times,”
merits consideration.
He argues, that “in the British Isles
there are too many people; in the
Dominions there are far too few. The
United Kingdom is overdeveloped in the
sense that much of our capital equipment
is obsolete ; our overcrowded towns and
communications are a liability rather than
an asset, and must be replanned and
replaced at great cost. The is of
development areas and new towns.” And
he asks the question “But why in Britain
alone? The Dominions, on the contrary,
are extremely underdeveloped for then-
size and resources.”
Swayne-Thomas is of the opinion that
“no country can arrive at the full
measure of its prosperity until its popu-
lation reaches a certain level. A railway
or road system of a thousand miles, for
instance, necessary to link cities and open
up territory in a new country, will not
reach its maximum economic value until
the whole region is fully developed and
populated. Although there may not be
agreement as to the optimum numbers
for any given country, there can be no
disagreement that the numbers of certain
countries, such as Canada and Australia,
are far too small for their own good.”
He thinks further that the “problems
of redressing the balance” are easy of
solution. What is needed, he finds, is
“a lead, and some competent organisa-
tion.” For the advance planning he looks
to “a united Dominions-Britain develop-
ment staff to do the job with the same
skill, devotion and determination as
achieved D-Day.”
The organisation favored is modelled
on the Army plan:
“A Commonwealth Development
Council should be formed of eminent
statesmen, one or two from each
Manchester "Dispatch.”
" DON’T FENCE ME IN.”
Dominion and from Britain. Under it
would come a Commonwealth Develop-
ment Directorate, a technical body, with
each director representing a Dominion.
Then survey parties of skilled engineers,
agriculturists, mineralogists, etc., should
be sent out to bring information from the
site, and prepare the campaign under
direction of the Dominions concerned.
Such parties would presumably be
selected largely from the Dominions
themselves. These ‘commandos’ would
then return to execute the plan with
working parties and within a year or two
new towns —surrounded by adequate
agricultural regions—would spring to life,
with new industries opened up, and with
new roads, railways, airways, and a whole
balanced economy.”
The writer points to the belief that
“Imperial defence must in future be far
more widespread. Great schemes are to
be developed in Australia for military
training and for rocket-projectile ranges,
on a scale quite impossible in the British
Isles. -Much of our training must in’
future be done in wider spaces if the
Empire is to have adequate defence, since
modern fighting vehicles and air fleets
cannot find room for training and man-
oeuvre in the small and congested British
Isles. All this must mean new towns and
new regions to be opened up ; enormous
new factories for munitions, and a hun-
dred other developments. The soldiers
to be trained will require permanent train-
ing establishments, and provision must
be made for wives and families. Here,
in brief, we have the prospect of a pro-
jection of population to new spaces —of
migration developments for war. The
same thing could and should be done on
a far bigger scale for the purposes of
peace.”
He looks into the question of expense:
“Precise costs will vary with the locali-
ties. Taking a town, with its surround-
ing agricultural areas, to house 20,000
people, we may allow for 5000 houses at
£lOOO each, a like sum for industrial
and commercial equipment, and perhaps
twice as much for public buildings and
services, transport and amenities and rural
development, making £20,000,000 in all
—a round figure of £lOOO of capital
equipment per head. This would be
spread over, say, four years of develop-
ment. On these rough figures, regions
supporting a million people in all could
be developed from scratch at an expense
equal to a hundred days’ cost of the war
for Britain alone. Today our supreme
task in the Commonwealth is to enlarge
and carry out such fruitful schemes.”

When Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia attacks
American airplanes, it is not due to error or
overexuberance or to anything else except a
calculated attempt to force withdrawal of
American troops stationed in the Trieste area.
The presence of those troops interferes with
the territorial ambitions of the man who calls
himself Tito. In Austria Tito’s Russian men-
tors are employing exactly similar tactics with
a similar purpose and it is at least interesting
that the Russian-manned planes which force
down American planes are those which Russia
secured from the United States by lend-lease.
The Chinese Communists pursue similar tactics
and again the purpose is to get the United
States Marines out of China. The agitation
of Moscow-dominated elements within this
country makes the purpose perfectly clear.
There is no one who can say that this country
will not withdraw. Certainly popular senti-
ment is demanding that the Marines be brought •
out of China, and one may doubt if it will
support Americans taking part in a form of
undeclared guerrilla warfare in the Balkans.
To mention those possibilities at this time opens
one to the charge of being an “isolationist”
and probably a supporter of Communist pur-
poses. Yet the possibilities are clearly there.
They can be avoided only if they are clearly
recognised and met candidly. “Wall-street

Britons are miffed because the drafts of the

doles out $lOO million in reparations to Russia
but nothing to Britain, which suffered directly
and severely from Italy’s entry into the war.

now is acutely short. Office buildings and
factory buildings that were partly vacant before
the war now are overflowing. Almost every-
where the country is breaking out at the seams.
Population is nearly 10,000,000 greater. Family
units have increased proportionately more than
population. Where the country had 35,125,000
families before the war, it now has 38,175,000.
There is need not only for more houses but
also for all the things that go into houses.
With more families, top, thefe will be more
children. The number of persons over 14 years
of age who are working or seeking work has
grown nearly 6,000,000 to a total of 61,501,000.
This means that industry and government and
other occupations need to provide many mil-
lion more jobs. In 1940, industry produced
at 25 per cent, above the average of 1935-39
and it was considered something of a boom
year. Now, industry is turning out goods at
a rate nearly 70 per cent, above 1935-39, and
that level of operations is to rise sharply.
Pre-war conceptions of the scope of industrial
operations have to be revised. Farmers are
producing food at a level nearly one-third
higher than in the 1935-39 period—still not
high enough to meet demands. Before the war
the Federal Government, with all its New
Deal activities, was able to spend at a rate
of only $9,000,000,000 a year. In this peace-'
time year, started July 1, the Government will
spend at a rate of $37,000,000,000. — “United

Nowhere is the Soviet “party line” of foreign
policy more clear than in Prussia. The Rus-
sians are backing the Communist and residual
left-wing socialist workers’ elements which
survived the Nazi regime. They hope to form
one single labor movement under Communist
domination. They hold before the masses the
vision of a Soviet Germany, united and strong.
The technique is identical with that employed
in Yugoslavia and, as in Titoland, there is in
Germany a new and vigorous nationalism.
It hopes to enlarge its acreage at the expense
of Poland just as Yugoslavia hopes to increase
its own at Italy’s cost. Frank Gervasi in
“Collier’s:’

In the last six years Europe has witnessed
the greatest mass movements of peoples in the
history of the world. The Germans started
it, first by mass persecution of the Jews, then
by the importation of slave labor from sub-
jugated countries. Since YE Day, 5,769,000
slave laborers have been repatriated. Many
of them, returning to their homes, have passed
Germans going the other way, fleeing from
or evicted by the Communists. Some 770,000
victims of Nazi persecution remain in
U.N.R.R.A. centres in Germany, either afraid
to go home or unwanted there. Of these,
423,000 are Poles, almost evenly divided be-
tween Jews and Catholics. There are more
than 200,000 additional Poles scattered about
in Great Britain, Italy, France, Belgium and
Holland, and thousands more in the Middle
East. Fugitives from the peace include, as
well, Yugoslavs, Rumanians, even some Rus-
sians. Two million Sudeten Germans were
ousted from Czechoslovakia. Thousands of
Germans fled from East Prussia following its
annexation to Poland, some of them being
replaced, by fugitive Poles quitting Polish terri-
tory which has been absorbed by Russia.
Now, by Russian edict, 54,000 non-Austrians
are being uprooted from that country, to be
shipped into German territory. In the national-
istic and ideological upheaval, Czechoslovakia,
Poland and Rumania have lost in both area
and population. So has Italy. Russia proper
has gained 180,000 square miles in territory
and several millions in population. Germany
has lost 41,000 square miles, and an estimated
increase Of 12,000,000 in population is to be
compressed into the reduced area. The ruth-
less .shoving around of European peoples is
contributing to anarchy and mass starvation
Parker La Moore in N.Y. “World-Telegram.”

More than 100,000 former U.S. servicemen
have a monetary interest in the writing of peace
treaties with enemy countries. They, or their
kin, can file claims for personal loss, physical
damage or deaths, while prisoners-of-war.
Their suits will be considered when terms of
the final peace treaties are discussed. The
basis of the right to sue is the Geneva Con-
vention of 1929, as wfell as statutes comprising
the Hague Convention in 1907. In both cases
prisoner-of-war treatment was included, and
the ground for individual suits against enemy
territories for mistreatment was established in
international law. The weight of the Govern-
ment will be on the side of the claimants.
Amounts asked vary from several hundred
dollars to several thousands. Precedent for the
claims actually is non-existent, the State Depart-
ment legal staff on international law maintains.
In the last war the number of captives was
relatively light, and few examples of mistreat-
ment were reported. The listing of names in
the treaties is probable if the Government feels
that it can best protect the interests of those
seeking legal action. Once the peace treaties
are written, individual accusations and
suits will be eligible for honoring, and probably
will be settled on a wholesale basis. N.Y.

SEVEN YEARS AFTER.
The worst Administration this country
has ever had is asking the electors to pro-
long its ignoble existence, and, at the
same time, to stultify themselves by plac-
ing in its hands, in more specious terms,
the Constitutional powers they rejected by
immense majorities two years ago.
“Labor” then had these powers, and will
have them to the end of this year ; but
in 1944 it. chose to divide a nation engaged
in foreign wars on an issue wholly un-
related to them, and to bill the taxpayers
for its party propaganda, cheekily camou-
flaged, though the Auditor-General ob-
jected, as “Post-War Education.”
Fatuous in its conceit, and blind to its
many sins of commission and omission,
the effects of which have been brought
home to every taxpayer, every wheat-
grower, every sheepman, every houseless
serviceman and civilian and every worn-
out housewife, this inept and guilty crowd
proclaims itself the best Administration
our Commonwealth has ever had. It has
even had the effrontery to assert that the
world is overwhelmed with admiration at
its conduct of the wars —the German
war, from which, to the chagrin of Mr.
Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt, it withdrew
the last Australian infantry division at
the end of 1942, and the Japanese war,
in which it maintained, at terrific financial
cost and at the cost of good feeling and
efficiency, two armies—one forbidden by
“Labor’s” Defence Act “amendments” to
go to the rescue of the A.I.F. division lost
at Singapore—and two Air Force adminis-
trations. This particular arrangement
drew from General MacArthhr the pro-
test that it was “completely violative of
sound military principles.”
On this Administration's record are the
tragedies of Rabaul, Ambon, Java, Timor
and the Kokoda Trail. And it is branded
With the guilt of Singapore to the extent
that its Army Minister, Mr. Forde,
promised the garrison relief at the
eleventh hour, saying in a radio message
that relief would go, “not as a few con-
signments from a shrinking store, but as
a stream” that would “swell to a flood,”
and “a flood” that would “grow to an
overwhelming torrent.” By dint of its
control of the House and of the military
censorship, this “Labor” Administration
concealed the truth about Rabaul,
Ambon, Timor, Java and Singapore, and
none of these appalling affairs was ever
debated in the “Labor”-dominated Par-
liament. It concealed also the ugly facts
of the bombing of Darwin and the looting
of Moresby and the dreadful incidence
of malaria and other tropical diseases
among the troops in New Guinea, who,
compared with the Americans, were
scandalously ill-equipped for tfopical
campaigning in almost every particular.
Of the heroic soldiers who interposed
their bodies between the barbarous Asiatic
enemy and their country. Brigadier
Fairley, Director of Medical Services,
has written that the mosquito nets issued
to them in 1942 were not only insufficient
but poor in quality, and that after the
Buna-Gona campaign the victors were ill-
fed and exhausted, and went down to
malaria in fearful numbers.
During the war against the Central
Powers the Australian-born members of
this Ministry found pressing engagements
in Australia, being particularly concerned
with the refusal of reinforcements to the
A.I.F. by the conscription route, and —
the N.S.W. detachment, with one excep-
tion —the 1917 strike. Two of them, Mr.
Ward and Mr. Beasley, who, appointed
Resident Minister in London, carried
with him a huge private commissariat,
boasted that they had refused to
enlist in the A.I.F. on high moral
grounds. Between the wars their party
abolished compulsory military training
and opposed defence votes. When the
second German war broke out, it took the
stand that Australia’s part in the struggle
should be confined to the sale of food-
stuffs and war materials to the other
British Commonwealth forces. It tried to
frustrate the formation of another A.1.F.,
the Empire Air Training Plan and even
the defence of Australia’s island terri-
tories, all of them, by called-up men.
For years after all danger of a
Japanese invasion had disappeared this
Administration maintained huge idle
forces on the continent, refusing to let its
partners have the use of a fine armored
division, the officers and men of which
were eating their hearts out. One effect
was a disgraceful desertion-rate —2.8 p.c.
of men in uniform in August, 1944, com-
pared with .019 p.c. in the British Army
for six months of that year. When Lord
Mountbatten’s men, having regained
Burma, were about to undertake the sal-
vation of Malaya, all that the “Laboi”
Prime Minister would say was that Aus-
tralia would, “if possible,” add “a token
force” to the army of liberation. In the
result the Australians who survived the
Japanese hell-camps and the horrors of
the Siam-Burma railway were rescued by
other hands. It is on the mournful
record that “15,117 of about 32,000 Aus-
tralians officially posted dead lie in un-
identified graves,” 10,479 of them “in
Singapore, Malaya, Burma, Siam, Borneo,
Java, Sumatra and islands nearer home,”
Yet “Labor,” which sent so many of
these men into action against an enemy
superior in numbers and equipment, and,
in the case of the 1092 Ambon men, with
complete naval supremacy, claims that it
Saved the Country. Its Mr. Ward,
the 1917-18 non-starter, is fond of
saying that the leader of the Gov-
ernment which recruited the second
A.1.F., whose Air Minister, now no more,
was second to none in the planning and
working out of the Empire Air Train-
ing Scheme, and which laid the founda-
tions of the munitions programme that
“Labor” claims as its own (“Labor’s”
special contribution was to waste about
£30,000,000 on the construction of one [l]
tank), should be placed on trial for his
life. If Mr. Ward, the Soviet-idolator
and England-hater, had the rudiments of
a conscience, he would go out and hang
himself.
For 10 months of 1931-32 Mr. Chifley
was Mr. Scullin’s Minister of Defence —
the third in 27 days. He and his col-
leagues were ousted on a Beasley censure
motion, for which Mr. Ward voted, and
at the two ensuing general elections he
was defeated in Macquarie, an opponent
on each occasion being a member of the
Beasiey-Ward faction. After other sad
wanderings in the wilderness, during one
of which Mr. Chifley stood for Auburn
against Mr. Lang—then one of the twin
gods of Mr. Ward’s idolatry, the other
being, of course, Mr. Stalin—Mr. Chifley
and Mr. Ward came together again, each
gentleman agreeing to overlook what he
had said of the other and his mob.
On this point appearances are that
these worthies are still “to dumb forget-
fulness a prey.” Nevertheless they are
engaged in an ill-concealed struggle for
supremacy in Caucus and for direction
of the Commonwealth Bank and financial
policy.
Mr. Ward has never renounced
his 1931-32 belief in interest-default, and
has notions about the national debt,
interest-free loans and “nationalisation”
of life-assurance offices and the rest which,
if he were given his head, might end in
the Australian pound having the purchasing
power of the Hungarian pengo. Mr. Chif-
ley’s ideas are not so mad, though he is
apparently of the opinion that the public
purse is bottomless, being independent of
such things as droughts, sabotaged pro-
duction and industry and the Communist-
wrecked export trade with the Dutch
East Indies, and that Parliamentary con-
trol of it is an exploded superstition.
Both gentlemen stand for the expropria-
tion and arbitrary distribution of profits
on dealings in privately-owned wheat and
wool delivered on compulsion. Both
talk, as if “Labor” had a prescriptive
right to “take and hold” the national
income (not necessarily by “revolutionary
industrial and political action”) and
spend it so as to secure the greatest de-
gree of comfort for “Labor” politicians
and their bureaucratic friends and get the
greatest number of votes. To both
any Opposition proposal to leave more
in the hands of those who earned the in-
come, by reducing war-time taxes —as has
been done in every country after every
successful war —amounts to “bribery.”
These politicians agree also in accord-
ing to the controllers of trade-unionism
power without responsibility, a power
greater than that of the Commonwealth.
They and their associates —-those cool,
calm, collected individuals who, without
any training in the art of war, but by
sheer native genius and resolution,
stopped the rot and Saved the Country—
accept the view that any Communist larri-
kin or gang of Communist larrikins, what-
ever the industrial law may say to the
contrary, is entitled to order Australians
out of their jobs, and forcibly prevent
other Australians from taking them, so
that it may wreck industry and pro-
duction, and, in the case of the Dutch
ships, fasten a criminal quarrel on White
Australia’s nearest white neighbors.
When these outrages occur the right of
coerced men to work and the welfare
and interests of the people are as nothing
to “Labor.” The solemn warnings of
history, that surrender to a lawless minor-
ity employing violence and dreaming of
bloodshed is a prescription for civil war,
are lost on this “Government.” Lost on
it, too, is the report on the Communist
conspiracy in Canada, though it was pre-
pared by two Supreme Court Justices,
and has been borne out by convictions of
and sentences on, among others, the Com-
munist Jew “Rose,” an M.P. Ex-Justice
Evatt might have been expected to show
some interest in this report and the sequel.
At the Paris “Peace” Conference he
“banged his fist on the table” in real or
simulated disgust at the impertinences and
insatiable greed of the Molotov mob.
He has never said “boo!” to Moscow’s
instalments in Australia. And he has
secured their favor at election meetings,
whereas Mr. Menzies—especially in Mr.
Ward’s electorate —has been a target for
Communist ruffianism, and his opponent
in Kooyong has a guarantee of “Labor”
preferences.
These “ ‘Labor’ principles” and sym-
pathies are alien “principles” and sym-
pathies. No Australian can accept them
without giving away what has been won
for him by his glorious ancestors* and
without condemning his country, which
has been preserved for him and his pos-
terity by the heroic exertions of two
generations of grand men, to the deadly
danger of being run by larrikins for
larrikins. The position and outlook call
for the removal of the “ ‘Labor’ Govern-
ment,” the smashing of its majority in the
Senate and the defeat of its second assault
on the Constitution by majorities as
sweeping as those by which the first
assault was repelled in 1944.
The Digger Vote.
There were good reasons why the war-
time Digger vote should have favored the
“Government.” With the tragedies of
Rabaul, Ambon, Java and Singapore, the
bombing of Darwin, the raid on Sydney
Harbor, the sinking of H.M.A.S. Can-
berra and the bitter affairs of the Kokoda
Trail and Buna-Gona recent memories,
it was easy to represent that any change
at Canberra would signal disunity and
disruption ; would be swapping horses in
midstream.
In Britain, the U.S.A., Canada and
N.Z., the same considerations prevailed,
and those in office, or reaching
office at the time of crisis to their coun-
try, remained there to the end. When
the end came in Britain a new Govern-
ment was set up, despite the fact -that
Mr. Churchill’s war leadership had been,
on solid grounds, extremely popular. It
was a demonstration of public reaction,
and the vote of the forces weighed
heavily in it.
Similar general reaction can be counted
on to weigh heavily in next Saturday’s
elections; but here the Digger vote —
considerably larger than a mere count of
ex-service heads—is certain to be influ-
enced by a host of special considerations.
The “Government” can no longer rely
on the bait it was able to use three years
ago. In his policy speech Mr. Chifley
attempted to do so, but, as everyone
knows, it fell pathetically flat. The burley
wasn’t only stale; it was self-evidently
spurious. The wonders allegedly per-
formed in the war period can now be
seen to have been shams.
While the war lasted it was different.
Then a security censorship, permitting
the most extravagant claims to war-win-
ning, prevented publication of facts that
would have made the claims ridiculous.
With that aid it "was possible to get an
audience for the monstrous lie of the,
“Brisbane line,” the preposterous allega-
tions of defeatism in the ranks of the
other side, the mean falsehood that that
other side, which went out of office two
months before the Japanese war began,
was criminally responsible for every
“regrettable incident” of that war.
Diggers at the fighting fronts could be
impressed by the arguments for national
unity and continuity of war effort. That
was the basis of their fighting. With the
facts censored or withheld, they could be
influenced by the ceaselessly publicised
“Government” claims to special war-win-
ning and Australia-saving virtues. They
could believe that the self-applauded
“Government” was indeed governing, and
that all was well in the land they were
fighting for. As well, there were the par-
ticular baits held out to them in the
guise of the “Government’s” lavish post-
war plans on their behalf —houses, voca-
tional training, land settlement, employ-
ment preference. There would be none
of the other post-war muddling. A
“Servicemen’s Charter” had been drawn
up well in advance. The Diggers’
Golden Age would be awaiting them
when the war ended.
They know all about that now. The
bulk of the Diggers are back, and the
bulk of them are disillusioned men. The
signs of it must be frightening to holders
of anything like shaky “Government”
seats, and frightening to the “Govern-
ment.” The cropping up at this election-
time of strong anti-Communist feeling in
the R.S.L. is not mere coincidence.
Neither is it related only to Communist-
controlled and Communism-controlling
Soviet Russia’s sabotaging of the peace,
incessant abuse of Britain and foul spy-
ing within the Empire. It has a special
Australian application. Shocked by the
chaos into which their country has been
allowed to drift during their absence and
must continue drifting while sectional in-
stead of national rule is the order at
Canberra, returned men know exactly
where the blame lies.
That alone is going to decide a large
amount of the Digger vote ; but there are
many other causes. By now those Diggers
who served in the fever-infested places of
the Pacific realise that, instead of being
the well-cared-for, well-equipped troops
their “Government” pretended, they were
meanly cared-for and meanly equipped
compared with those fighting beside them.
It left them exposed to malaria and other
diseases that better care and equipment
would have prevented ; and that was a
legacy of the Wards and others who, on
their utterances, would have preferred to
see Australia’s outposts overrun, and who
did their utmost to prevent, not only the
formation of the A.I.F. which fought
there, but, before that, defensive prepared-
ness in those outposts, including know-
ledge of tropical diseases and conditions.
There are thousands of homes in which
that sorry performance by the “Govern-
ment” side is now most acutely remem-
bered.
Wherever they turn the Diggers see the
signs of similar shabby treatment. Com-
pared with the pampering of the home-
front, it gives strong ground for the wide-
spread Digger feeling that the “Govern-
ment,” so far from holding Digger inter-
ests —individual and collective —as para-
mount as in ordinary gratitude they
should be held, shows in many of its acts
a positive anti-Digger attitude. The miser-
able treatment accorded those who volun-
teered for occupational duties in lapan
looks only too typical.
The present returned Digger has
greater cause for bitterness than his
counterparts of the earlier war had. For
all that has been said of the muddling
then, they at least came back to very
much the same country that they had left.
It was still a land of plenty, and a free
land. It was not a land brought to the
brink of industrial and general chaos by
a so-called “Government’s” surrender to
Communist mobs. There was real prefer-
ence in employment, instead of this same
“Government’s” “subterfuge” preference
the worth of which has already been
freely exposed—in the sacking of Diggers,
on the last-to-come-first-to-go “principle,”
in “Government” department interpreta-
tions of the Act to the exclusion of
Diggers, and in other instances that will
become more and more common unless a
real Government can lay hands on the
Act and amend it.
For any muddle that occurred after
the earlier war there was the reasonable
enough excuse that the rehabilitation of
large numbers of men was something en-
tirely new and experimental. Despite
what experience then taught, the muddle
the present Digger encounters is incom-
parably worse, and this though the
“Servicemen’s Charter” was prepared
and made law long before the war ended.
What the Digger was promised under that
“Charter” makes grim reading today-
especially grim for the many thousands
still vainly looking for houses for them-
selves and their wives; still waiting for
land holdings which, at the present rate,
they will be waiting for 10 or even 20
years’ hence.
That the “Charter” was so much hurley
the various happenings under the “prefer-
ence” provisions have plainly shown. Yet,
on the face of it, it was —omitting the
shabby “preference” section —a fair-
looking thing. Bit by bit, when it comes
to practical application, it is being ex-
posed as hollow. One of the latest ex-
posures concerns the vocational-training
provisions on which Mr. Dedman at the
time laid particular emphasis. Mr. Ded-
man stated that “in each case training
allowances varying from £3 ss. to £5 ss.
per week” would be paid. A university
guidance officer dealing with such cases
has been reported as stating that “a
married man finds that £4 16s. a week,
less tax, is inadequate with the present
cost of living.” Mr. Dedman did not
mention tax. The inadequacy of the
taxed allowance has led to this reported
result: “70 out of 600 first-year medical
students have left Sydney University, 50
out of 400 in economics, and 50 out ot
400 in engineering.”
Diggers who are paying the price under
any of these sections of the “Charter
housing, land, employment preference,
training—all have their individual reasons
for disillusionment. Add the collectiv e
Digger resentment at returning to find the
country they fought for —its internal am
foreign affairs; its industry and trans-
port ; its present and its future —turner
over to Communist wreckers. the
Digger voters are not now absent front
the scene, and the damning evidence oi
what has happened to their country in
their absence is all about them.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Nothing for Britain.
Argentina, “Fascist” Argentina to every
ranting Red and Pink in Australia and
elsewhere, has announced a Christmas gift
to the British people of three shiploads
of wheat. There have been gifts of like
and larger kind from other Governments,
and Brazil is now in (the field with
special concessions to Britain.
The Australian “Government” has as
good cause as anyone to express practi-
cal sympathy and gratitude to the British
people. Has it done so? Let the Parlia-
mentary reports, page 640, answer:
Food for Britain.
Mr. White asked the Prime Minister,
upon notice —
(1) Has the Government acquired and
sent any gift food to the United Kingdom?
If so, what was the quantity and type sent
during the financial years ended June,
1943, 1944 and 1945, and for the period
Ist July, 1945, to March, 1946?
(2) What assistance has been given by
South Africa and New Zealand during the
above terms ?
(3) Will the Government give considera-
tion to the acquirement of £2,000,000 worth
of meat, fats and dairy produce for early
shipment as a gift to the United Kingdom?
Mr. Chifley.—The answers are:
(1) No.
(2) The Commonwealth Government has
no official knowledge of this.
(3) No.
That is bad enough, but this same
“Government” strenuously opposed pri-
vate efforts to send gifts of food to
Britain —vainly, thank God!
When the wars ended and Aus-
tralians learned of Britain’s plight their
sympathy and generosity bloomed into a
national desire to alleviate it. Food-for-
Britain appeals sprang up overnight
throughout the country. Hundreds of
thousands freely offered coupons, money,
services, anything that would assist. The
thing mounted to a great wave of giving.
Then the nation was stupefied to hear,
first the Food Controller (Mr. Murphy)
and the/i the Minister in charge of Food
Control (Mr. Dedman), opposing the
whole thing to the extent of threatening
to use Commonwealth powers against it.
This on the spurious allegation that the
Chifley Government’s food - rationing
system was so perfect that the people
couldn’t afford to give away one surplus
ounce of food, and that the Chifley Gov-
ernment could be safely left to see that
Britain got every ounce we could spare.
How far that Government had missed
the spirit and sentiment of the movement
was curtly put by the Mayor of Adelaide
when, intensely disappointed with and
angry at official checks to his State’s
appeal,, he reminded Mr. Dedman that
there was a vast difference between selling
food to the British and giving it to them.
To the credit of the nation, the Food
for Britain work went on in the face of
“Labor’s” indifference and whatever
official obstacles “Labor” could put in its
way. In New Zealand the Labor Prime
Minister officially launched a great Food
for Britain movement, based on the very
system of coupon surrender which the
Chifley Government stopped, and gave it
the blessing and assistance of his Govern-
ment. It meant nothing to the Chifley
crowd. Their attitude to Britain was
“We’ll give you nothing. You must go
on paying top price for everything we
send.” Among the black marks on its
record, this one ranks with the blackest,
because it sprang from narrow obstinacy
and callous indifference to the plight of
people of our own blood.
ITiat, among other things, will be re-
membered against “Labor” on Saturday.
No Briton Need Apply.
Refused preference by the Central
Preference Board—which gave no reasons
—Major C. R. Stephan, Imperial ex-
serviceman, is heading back to Britain.
He expressed appreciation of R.S.L.
efforts on his behalf, but could not wait
while a possibly adverse decision was be-
ing reached. Summing up on the deal
handed out to him, he commented:
Unfortunately Australia is making great
difficulties for herself. She is not encour-
aging British migrants of the right type.
If she takes up the sort of attitude I have
experienced she will not get first-class
citizens.
In that allocation of blame Major
Stephan was wrong. Australia has no
more to do with the treatment accorded
him than Nicaragua. For “Australia”
he should have said “the ‘Labor’ ‘Govern-
ment’ responsible for the Re-establishment
Act,” and responsible also, through its
Mr. Calwell, for priority to Continental
Jews of unexplained origins and unknown
numbers. Responsible, as well, for re-
leasing an unstated number of interned
enemy aliens, with their internment
period counting for naturalisation pur-
poses —at a time when an R.S.L. presi-
dent has declared that “only about 38
per cent, of our returned men are fully
rehabilitated.”
When the Dedman Act was being
hatched the R.S.L. appointed a committee
of experts to draw up a general reha-
bilitation plan. This —duly laid before
the “Government,” and, of course,
ignored—made specific provision for pre-
ference to British ex-servicemen; a pro-
vision which Australia, distinct from the
“Labor” “Government,” would most em-
phatically endorse. The anti-British ele-
ment in that “Government” represents
the most insignificant of any Australian
minorities, though its voice has been
loud enough in the “Government.”
The Major Stephan case is not isolated.
R.S.L. solicitor Vincent J. Brady has
stated that “a few hundred similar cases
will be affected by the decision in Major
Stephan’s case.” Mr. Brady further al-
leged that “the board’s decisions were in-
fluenced by political considerations” and
that it was “sheltering behind secrecy.”
What it boils down to is that Australia
loses a new citizen of the best of all kinds
that it urgently needs —the British kind —
and looks like losing hundreds more,
apart from the discouraging effect on
thousands the Major Stephan case will
have when it gets an airing in Britain.
The blame is Australia’s only insofar as
it can be held responsible for having such
a “Government.”
Dud and Humbug.
Upwards of 15 months since the Ger-
mans caved in, and nearly 14 months
since the Japanese surrender, Australia
is still badly off for nearly every requisite
except food. The position is worst in the
largest State, the one which has been
completely “Labor” since June, 1941,
which has 21 “Labor” Ms.H.R., six
TAKING STRIKE FOR SATURDAY’S TEST.
“Labor” Senators, 56 “Labor” Assembly-
men and 28 “Labor” Leg. Councillors.
This “Labor” State is especially short of
coal, trams, ’buses, trucks (for want of
which whole flocks and herds have
perished in the drought), furniture,
building materials and building labor.
Its State “Labor” Government was more
intent on setting up a racing club during
the Japanese war, and, when that war
was over, on providing pensions for
“Labor” Assemblymen, far greater than
those received by maimed servicemen of
two wars and the widows of servicemen
who gave their all for their country, than
on providing the requirements of a
civilised community.
For want of the housing which “Labor”
offered so lavishly in speeches and in the
lucubrations of its hordes of planners,
thousands of N.S.W. servicemen and their
families are still pigging it in huts,
garages and rooms; and no real woman
has ever been reconciled to using an-
other woman’s kitchen. These people
and their congeners in other States were
promised scores of thousands of houses
by Mr. H. P. Lazzarini, who runs the
Commonwealth Housing Department—
very badly. Having to go up for
Werriwa (N.S.W.) again, and being
opposed by a rising hope of the
Liberals who served in the R.A.N., Mr.
Lazzarini finds it necessary to make ex-
cuses, and this was the excuse he thought
up for a meeting at Darlington (Sydney),
which a whole 30 persons attended:
The shortage of houses is due to lack
of manpower and materials. If the anti-
“ Labor” regimes that were in power at the
time of the depression had sent thousands
of unemployed men into the brickyards
and forests there would be plenty of houses
now.
What pestilent nonsense, but how char-
acteristic of the Lazzarinis and their kind!
Had thousands of young men been
sent to Darwin and Moresby when the
Japanese marched into Manchuria in 1931
Australia would not have been so helpless
when the enemy struck in 1942, nor
would 100,000 Australian servicemen
have gone down to malaria, scrub typhus
and other tropical diseases for want of the
medical research and preparation which
would have accompanied the beginnings
of northern defence even if confined to
Darwin and Moresby. But the Scullin
“Labor” Government closed Duntroon,
halved the defence vote, reduced the
number of Jervis Bay College cadets to
30, skittled the national army and left
its successors with about 28,000 ill-trained
volunteers (“the normal training period
was 16 days per annum, including eight
days in camp” —Commonwealth Year-
Book ), where four years before there
had been 48,000 called-up men whose
esprit-de-corps was high. This was all to
the taste of Mr. Lazzarini. He had
even opposed the building of H.M.A,.S.
Australia and H.M.A.S. Canberra as a
useless and dangerous provocation to
foreign countries.
As for the “anti-Tabor’ regimes which
were in power at the time of the depres-
sion,” there was only one in office
throughout that period—the McPhee
Government in Tasmania. Certainly the
Moore Government had come in at Bris-
bane on May 21, 1929, but it went out
during the depression ; actually in June,
1932. Except for that ' intermission
“Labor” has been in power in Queens-
land since June, 1915. The other five
Governments were “Labor” when the
calamity came:
Mr. Scullin’s in the Commonwealth from
Oct. 22, 1929; Mr. Hogan’s in Victoria
from Dec. 12, 1929; Mr. Lang’s in N. S.
Wales from Nov. 4, 1930; Mr. Hill’s in
S.A. from April 17, 1930, and Mr. Collier’s
in W.A., 1924-30. True, Mr. Collier’s
Government was displaced by that of Mr.
Mitchell in April, 1930, but it was back
in May, 1933.
Mr. Scullin’s Administration went out
of office on January 6, 1932. How was
it put out? On a censure motion tabled
by Mr. Beasley, leader of the Lang
group, and supported by Mr. Lazzarini.
Whom "Labor 11 Puts First.
When the necessities of war brought
about shortages of certain foodstuffs,
articles of apparel, beer, tobacco, petrol
and so forth and travel restrictions Aus-
tralians in general accepted them in a
good spirit—were, indeed, glad to do so
as part of their contribution to a cause
in which others were fighting to the
death. Their gladness changed to some-
thing else when it became evident that
the extent of these sacrifices was dictated
by either one’s party adherence, real or
assumed, or one’s place of residence.
What was the truth? What is the
truth even now? Any “good ‘Labor’ ”
community never went as short of things
like bacon, eggs, potatoes, beer and
tobacco as “non-Labor” communities.
Any collection of unionists —miners,
wharfies, ironworkers —who were numeri-
cally strong and represented a block
“Labor” vote received “special” issues of
these things.
One could travel to any “Labor” strong-
hold such as Lithgow or Gessnock or
Erskineville, in N. S. Wales, and their
counterparts in other States, and there
find on open sale goods denied to other
communities. Any criticism was met by
the smug “Labor” reply that “the war-
worker” came “first” —as though “Labor”
supporters had a monopoly of “war
work”! Under “Labor” any little gang
of railway navvies, any bunch who held
union tickets, could threaten to strike if
they didn’t get more beer or more
tobacco, and “Labor” Ministers hurriedly
dropped whatever they were doing and
saw that they got it.
In the midst of travel restrictions,
when mothers were denied permission to
visit sick children and wives of wounded
soldiers were prevented from visiting them,
when people on really important mis-
sions had great trouble in travelling, pro-
fessional pugs, bookies, dog-owners,
footballers and Communists were “set”
for the best of whatever was going.
“Labor” and its new departments, as well
as the Communists, never went short of
paper for booklets, “dodgers,” periodi-
cals, pamphlets; of cars or tyres or
petrol; of building material or men
to use it. And every good “Labor” sup-
porter, also including Communists, with
claims to a highly paid job got one.
This catalogue of sectionalism and pre-
ferment could go on indefinitely—it is
still going on, indeed has been speeded
up in view of an imminent change of
Government —but nobody should need
any further reminder. What is neces-
sary to remember is that this is the crowd
which, in advocating a Yes vote for its
three referendums next Saturday, has the
hide to assert that none of them is a
party issue. What a gang to which to
talk about impartiality in administration
or anything else! What a gang to ask
the people for support for three steps to-
wards socialisation, which is what the
referendum proposals were in 1944 and
are in 1946.
A.B.C. and a Communist.
If the Opposition parties are returned to
power, one of their first moves towards
cleansing the Australian stable should
be to call A.B.C. to account for its
favoritism to Sharkey, formerly a member
of the World Executive of the Comin-
tern, who was privileged to broadcast
over 25 radio “national stations” under
the guise of making an election policy
speech.
Sharkey, of course, did not broadcast
Communist policy. He would no more
dare to broadcast it over national stations
than A.B.C. would dare to allow him
to do it. Yet A.B.C. must have known
that it was lending its facilities to the
agent of a body which was placed beyond,
the law, and which justified the enemy’s
actions and urged adoption of the
enemy’s demand for a Hitler peace.
A little book. Betrayal, issued by the
Sane Democracy League and signed by
Michael Carr, should make particularly
interesting reading for A.B.C. and such
of its subscribers as may have been gulled
by its protege Sharkey.
On December 8, 1940, as Betrayal
quotes, Sharkey’s rag, the Communist
“Tribune,” then illegal, printed the fol-
lowing:— ~
Menzies in his war-loan appeal said:
“We must pay, pay, pay for our credit’s
sake.” Pay for the plunderers’ war, so
that the small wealthy, parasite class he
represents will grow richer The war-
mongers scare the masses with Hitler so
that monstrous profits will be realised.
Stop buying War Savings Certificates. Burst
up the workplace group racket. You need
all your wages for food, clothing, the home
and the struggle against the profiteers.
Cut out overtime. Save your energy for
the class struggle. Don’t work to get
money to hand over to the tax collector.
Get ready to strike next January against
the taxation wage cuts.
And again:
Submission to unity behind Churchill
and Menzies and Attlee means submission
to war and starvation in the interests of
the rich gluttons... .The A.1.F.. ...is fight-
ing for colonies, for the division of the
colonies in the interests of the British capi-
talist class and its Australian junior partner.
This poison was published while Aus-
tralian soldiers were dying on the battle-
fields of Bardia, while Britain was still
wracked with air raids, while tens of
thousands of British and millions of Poles,
Dutch, Belgians, Norwegians and French
were prisoners under the Nazi heel.
A.B.C.’s part is all the more shameful
in the fight of the contrast between its
help to the Communists at_ this election
and its unhelpfulness on ascertain occa-
sion during the 1943 election campaign.
On that occasion one candidate among
the 400-odd in the field, A. M. Blain,
M.H.R. for the Northern Territory, was a
prisoner of war. His electorate was a
war zone. It was impossible for his
friends to journey there to speak for him
against the five candidates opposing him.
The campaign was so short, the distances
were so long, that it seemed problematical
whether his election literature would be
delivered on time.
A.B.C. was asked to allow one of
Blain’s friends a quarter of an hour to
plead his cause on its short-wave ser-
vice. It refused, on the mean ground
that if it aided the p.-0.-w. member it
might offend other candidates. The re-
fusal came back almost by return mail.
The night it reached Blain’s friend A.B.C.
gave time to a man born in Hungary to
condemn British policy in Italy and extol
Lettish policy there.

POLITICAL POINTS
As well as giving nation-wide circula-
tion to the Communist Sharkey’s “policy
speech,” A.B.C. is being wonderfully
kind to Dr. Evatt. This is not necessarily
connected with the fact that, while the
Canadian, British and South African
Governments are taking drastic measures
against the Communist conspiracy,
according to the particular outrages com-
mitted in their countries, Dr, Evatt is
not doing a thing to it or saying a word
about it.
Playford, introducing his Budget,
said that uniform taxation had deprived
S.A. of revenue which, collected, would
have assured balanced budgets for several
years without any special Commonwealth
grants. As it is, with grants of £1,654,000
in two years, his 1945-46 deficit was
£428,000. And the one Liberal Premier
isn’t setting up cut-price airlines or
dabbling in mad and extravagant rail-
standardisation schemes.
According to Forde, Chifley is a “plain,
blunt, honest Australian who is not going
to win elections by false promises.” Every
other plain, blunt, honest Australian will
get up next Saturday morning determined
to see that he doesn’t.
At the week-end Our Foreign Policy
was heard on his favorite theme: “The
Curtin-Chifley Government has raised
Australia to the position of a major
Power in the Pacific.” Unfortunately
this blah synchronised with a blast from
Tokyo, the author of the blast being a
staff writer on the hitherto adoring Syd-
ney “Daily Telegraph”:
Australia has flunked supplying adequate
labor, material supplies, and organisation
of top-level Government influence to
lighten the dreary round of occupation
work... .failed to secure even piping for
steam-heating our barracks, so that troops
who shivered in ramshackle buildings
throughout last winter must do so again
this whiter. We have already forfeited
the confidence of our British, N.Z. and
Indian comrades, amused the Americans
and earned the reputation in Japan of
being “the weak sister” of the occupa-
tion. .. .All our brave talk about Australian
nationhood and Australian destiny rings
cheap when translated into our fumbling,
pinchpenny occupation technique. The Aus-
tralian flag we are now showing in Japan
is a cheap, second-hand colonial model.
And all this despite the “action”
promised by Forde, that Man of Action,
“after denying doggedly for six months
that there was any ground for criticism.”
Lazzarini was defeated for Werriwa in
1931 by McNicoll, a distinguished ser-
viceman of the war in which Lazza-
rini’s distinctions, if any, were earned
on the home-front —by support for the
anti-conscription campaigns and the 1917
strike. His present serviceman opponent
is much younger than General McNicoll
was in 1931 ; young enough to have a
grandfather the age of Lazzarini,
who, like nearly all of his colleagues, is
stricken in years. Actually Watson
is no younger than C. E. Frazer was
when Frazer was elected for Kalgoorlie
in 1903, and the Labor party of the
period thought no end of Frazer (it gave
him a place in the Cabinet at 29) till
success and other things went to his head.
Herbert (Q.) never figures on the lists
of doubtful seats drawn up by cocksure
young “‘Labor’ commentators” who are
allowed to write what they like in alleged
Opposition newspapers; but old Parlia-
mentary hands in Queensland will be in
no way astonished if it changes this time.
That fine old Australian F. W. Bamford
won Herbert for Labor from 1901 to
1914; then, as a conscriptionist support-
ing Hughes, he turned it over to the
Nationalists in 1917, 1919 and 1922. He
was succeeded by Dr. Nott, who defeated
Theodore in 1925 and was only 154 be-
hind G. W. Martens in 192,8. Martens
got in at six subsequent elections, but
lost the nomination this year, and in the
result there is open war between the
A.W.U. man who deprived him of party
“endorsement” and the Communist who
is Paterson’s substitute —Paterson was
second to Martens in 1943. This quarrel,
together with the swing against “Labor,”
admits of the possibility that the Lib.-
C.P. man or the Service group candidate
may bring off a surprise.
In an early election address Spender
referred to the occurrence of wealth
among representatives of the toiling
masses, saying “there are men on the
other side who could buy and sell me.”
Possibly this set in motion an incredible
rumor that Senator Keane, who was
Minister of Trade and Customs from
October 7, 1941, to April 27, 1946, cut up
for £300,000. Keane’s Victorian estate
was sworn at £5862. Spender should be
more careful.
No Australian pig-iron was sent to
Japan during the five pre-war years 1934-
39; only scrap iron and steel —270,000
tons: a small fraction of what the
U.S.A. exported to Japan during the same
period. If “Labor” had had its way the
Japs would have got all the iron ore they
could mine and ship from Yampi, North
W.A. Five of their technicians were there
in January, 1937, and the Westralian
“Labor” Government, with Curtin’s ap-
proval (Curtin said “There is no more
reason for refusing iron ore than any
other commodity that might strengthen
Japan in her economic organisation”),
was willing to let Japan have anything
up to a million tons per annum. Over
the protests of Willcock, Curtin and the
Japanese Consul-General, the Lyons-
Menzies Government prohibited iron-ore
exports to Japan.
Britain, coming in after the U.S.A., is
sending its German p.-0.-w. back to
their country. Australia should follow
suit in respect of both Germans and
Italians. The necessity was pointed out
by the escape of a score of Italian
p,-0.-w. on the third anniversary of their
country’s capitulation. Nearly all these
captives, Germans and Italians alike, had
to join the colors whether they wanted
to fight or not, and it is inhuman to go
on keeping them behind barbed wire be-
cause Moscow prefers an indefinite state
of war to the conclusion of peace, fear-
ing the effect of having to withdraw its
huge and hungry occupation forces be-
hind “the iron curtain.”
There has been rain in parts of Queens-
land and N. S. Wales, including the
Gwydir electorate, possibly in answer
to Scully’s prayers. Previously Scully
had had beggarly attendances at
his election meetings, maybe because
Gwydir wheatgrowers and sheepmen
couldn’t trust themselves not to explode
in anger at Labor’s dealings in their
wheat and wool. Though defeat of
Scully never enters the calculations of
the “Labor” boys who write for alleged
Opposition newspapers, the prospect
must haunt Scully day and night. He
got in at a by-election in 1937 and was
returned in 1940 and 1943. His predeces-
sor, C. L. A. Abbott, won Gwydir for
the Country party in 1925, 1928, 1931,
1934 and 1937, losing by a small
majority at the landslide to Labor in
1929.
Betting on Commonwealth elections is
an offence against the Electoral Act, as
is the breaking-up of election meetings by
the cowardly and brutal mob (that should
be treated as a most serious offence); but
the legal ban has not prevented “Labor”
writers from quoting or imagining the
odds on particular contests. One of their
stories was that Sydney bookmakers were
laying evens against “Labor” losing any
of its 21 N.S.W, seats in the House. There
followed an assertion that the same book-
makers or some bookmakers were offer-
ing 10 to 1 against Haylen in Parkes.
Another yarn was that Brisbane book-
makers would take 6 to 4 against Hadley
in Lilley and even money against Lawson
in Brisbane. The Bulletin doesn’t be-
lieve a word of these narratives.
From a series of expensive Miners’
Federation advertisements, published just
before the 1943 elections;
We dig the coal. We’ll dig it till we’re
worn out. Under Curtin’s leadership we’ll
never let Australia down!
Then the Communist-controlled show
proceeded to let Australia down by per-
sistent and wicked reduction of output—
nearly 8,000,000 tons in four years. Re-
sorting to blackmail, it failed to get the
Chifley-McKell Coal Industry Bill passed
as drafted, the McKelly gang being
forced to compromise after two “Labor”
Leg. Councillors had absented themselves
from the critical divisions. Another
form of blackmail aims at securing penal
rates for coalminers “working” every
second Saturday till the long Christmas-
New Year holidays. The blackmail bill
is to be charged to the taxpayers; but
what a chance they have of getting more
coal with the “spring meetings” coming
on!
A fellow-feeling obviously exists be-
tween Sullivan, the N.Z. Minister of Sup-
ply, and Scully, the Australian Minister
of Agriculture. In an expansive moment
Sullivan, with thoughts of the impending
N.Z, elections, announced that Scully
had agreed to let him have Australian
wheat “for the next four or five years,”
at a “ceiling price” of ss. 9d. a bushel.
Then it came out that the British Labor
Government had entered into a contract
to buy Canadian wheat at Just on 10s.
Australian a bushel, and Mr. Sullivan
crept into his shell. “We are not going
to take part in the Australian elections”
was the excuse he gave.
Toting Rosevear, the Speaker, about
the country is a most expensive business.
Rosevear’s transport expenses as Con-
troller of Footwear came to between
£2OOO and £3OOO, and the Auditor-
General pointedly, though fruitlessly, ob-
jected. Rosevear has the use of one of
the “Government’s” fleet of luxury cars
(fluid-drive Chryslers, complete with
all modern gadgets). Chauffeur-driven
from Sydney to Brisbane so that the
Speaker might do a spot of electioneering
for “Labor,” the car had a losing argu-
ment with a truck. It had to be left out-
side the Commonwealth building, ex-
posed to the nasty remarks of all ob-
servers. If some of these caravans could
speak what tales they could tell!
One woolly-minded Leftist has reason
to thank all his stars that he is an Ameri-
can. Had he been a Minister of the
country which he appears to love more
than his own, the newsposters which read
“Truman Sacks Wallace” would have
read “Stalin Shoots Wallace.”
Mrs. Jessie Street, “Labor” candi-
date for Wentworth (N.S.W.), is a
Heroine of the Soviet (Second Class),
and S’Ben Fuller is chairman of her cam-
paign committee. S’Ben’s horny hand
signed an appeal for funds —“names of
subscribers will be treated as confiden-
tial.” A Point Piper fashionable, S’Ben
is, of course, always at home to unionists
and their wives, who remember that a
title-hating “‘Labor’ Government” had
him knighted for something or other —
perhaps because he discovered “Stiffy”
and “Mo.”
Under war-time conditions, when justi-
fication for it wasn’t far to seek, “Labor”
proved itself a great hand at “resuming”
land or buildings for its war-time depart-
ments. But “Labor’s” taste for this sort
of thing is spreading. The MeKellys in
N. S. Wales have used it outrageously
under their Housing Commission and
dabble with the idea of using it to take
over public lands for racecourses. Now
- Queensland “Labor” has a Co-operative
Societies Bill going through which will
enable a co-operative to take over a
home, church or any other building if
it can show that the edifice or land is
needed for a purpose that “is in the public
interest.” What’s more, it could take over
a thriving business on the same grounds.
There is to be “compensation,” of course,
but no right of appeal. It’s about time
this country asserted the good old English
tradition of a man’s home (or business)
being his castle.
Trans-Australia Airlines, the Govern-
ment show, has cut the passenger fare
between Sydney and Melbourne by 15
p.c. and the cyt is hailed as “the first shot
in the anticipated airlines battle for pas-
sengers and freight.” If private airlines
have to cut, too, and are forced to sack
men and reduce the wages of others in
order to survive against the competition
of this Government outfit, which pays
no taxes, they’ll be howled down by every
“Labor” politician. Cut-price wars
always hurt the employees of the con-
cerns doing the cutting.
After the disgraceful exhibition at the
Maccabean Hall, Darlinghurst, where
Ward’s Communist friends gave Menzies
what the Sydney “Tribune” exultantly
described as “the political hiding of his
lifetime” —actually it was a typically
clumsy and brutal Communist stunt that
will cost “Labor” many votesr—ls men
were charged with offences under the
Electoral Act. If the names and descrip-
tions of the arrested men are genuine,
only one of them is enrolled for East
Sydney—unless the other 14 have filled
in their papers since May, 1946.
Politicians and promises go hand in
hand, but Alexander Alexander, an
“Independent” candidate for the Senate
in N.S.W.. will take a power of
stoushing as an all-round promiser.
By advertisement in a Sydney Jewish
paper he undertakes to work un-
reservedly for ex-servicemen and depen-
dants ; he’s in favor of the primary pro-
ducer receiving the whole of the money
due to him ; he believes a settlement in
the coalmining industry would be effected
if taxation was sufficiently reduced; he
promises to support unlimited Jewish
immigration into Australia. Rather a
promising Scot—if he is a Scot.
Adapting a sentence from the Declara-
tion of Independence, Dr. Evatt has been
telling his audiences that “Labor” aims
at securing for everyone “life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness.” How much hap-
piness has the married serviceman who,
for lack of the housing which “Labor”
and its planners promised so effusively,
has to live in a hut, a garage, a bedroom
(“with use of kitchen,” as likely as not
a nag’s), in a humpy or on a verandah?
And how much liberty, if he is ordered
to strike or forced into a “sympathetic”
strike (with the certainty of being man-
handled and boycotted if he resists) by
a union boss or mob? Even life is an
uncertain prospect if the serviceman has
malaria, caught perhaps while lying on
a groundsheet imperfectlymrotected from
anopheles by a primitive mosquito net
of “Labor’s” 1942 issue, and if his wife
becomes a prey to the nervous and
physical exhaustion incident to her being
a beast of burden. It is no use quoting
beautiful sentences from the classics
when facts cry out against them with
bitter irony.
Dr. Evatt can’t have been reading
David Lawrence, editor of the “United
States News.” Referring to one of the
American strikes, Lawrence wrote:-
The right of the people to be secure in
their employment and in the distribution
of the necessities of life transcends the
right of any group to obstruct such em-
ployment or such distribution. These are
basic truths, inherent in the right of the
people to life, liberty and the pursuit ot
happiness. To deprive the people of these
rights by economic force is to assert a right
of rebellion. Rebellion cannot be tolerated
by the majority.
All strikes against a nation in con-
tempt of arbitration are forms of civil
war. Not to resist and overcome them is
to invite civil war in its bloodiest form.

"AND IT'S pRINTED
WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Clooter”: In my city, on the 14th of
this month, an unassuming little man
was accidentally killed. The death and its
circumstances, down to the last detail,
were featured in all city newspapers on
that and the fallowing day, with banner
headlines and pictures on the front
pages and further references on other
pages. Radio stations joined in, and so
it went on for two more days. Then the
unfortunate little fellow was buried. The
crowd at the “funeral parlor” so blocked
the traffic in one of the city’s largest
squares that the Premier and members of
the Legislature had to jostle their way
through to the “parlor.” More than
70,000 people lined the route of
the funeral procession, itself a mile
long and headed by motor - cycle
police ; children stood up in schoolrooms
to watch ; people stayed away from work
to attend. And again the newspapers did
the thing more than justice with head-
lines and photographs. The dead man?
A war hero? A great statesman, or poet,
or leader? No ; a jockey. Had he not
been killed and had his horse, the
favorite, been beaten he’d have probably
ridden back to the saddling paddock
through a storm of hoots and jeers.

Damage Report for one Army spoon.
But the best thing of this kind that came
to my notice was a letter written by
our hygiene wallah reporting the loss of
a scrubbing brush, which went like this;
“Whilst on tour of duty cleaning the
latripes I was scrubbing the seat and it
slipped from my hand and fell down
the pit. As I had borrowed same from
the cooks I tried to recover it, but was
unsuccessful.” After that the Q.M. saw
to it that whoever else went short of
scrubbing brushes, the hygiene bloke
didn’t.

“Pubserv”; Our neighbor’s two young-
sters, a girl of four and a boy of 2\,
were missing. Parents and friends
searched the neighborhood and the police
were informed. The strays were tracked
down two or three miles away on a busy
highway, where they had perplexed an
elderly man who had asked the lass
where she lived, “All I have been
able to find out,” he told the relieved
parents, “is that her name’s Dulcie and
his is John and they’re looking for
whisky.” His puzzled look disappeared
when it was explained that “Whisky” was
a dog.

“Jasby”: It seems to be the open
season for taking potshots at radio quiz
masters; if they are not being assailed
for paying out money on the wrong
answer, they are getting it in the neck
for not paying on the right one. Let
me heave one more brick. On a recent
Sunday night the Quiz Kids were asked
the origin of the term “Admirable
Crichton.” They hazarded that Crichton
Was a character in a play. Pressed for
the name of the author they suggested
in turn Shaw, Goldsmith, Sheridan and
Coward, Reluctantly the "Quiz Master
gonged them and referred the question
to the “listeners’ representative,” who
plumped for Barrie and collected a prize.
He was lucky. Barrie certainly wrote a
play of that name, but the real Admirable
Crichton flourished three centuries be-
fore Barrie put pen to paper. James
Crichton was born about 1560, got his
M.A. at St. Andrew’s University at 15
and became renowned as a paragon of
learning. He was indeed the quiz kid
of his day, and during a visit to Italy
he gave such a display of scholarship
in public “disputations”—the sixteenth-
century equivalent of quiz “sessions”—
that he earned the prefix “admirable.” At
22 he was shot in a street brawl. Quiz
kids, take warning!

“F.S.”: After sitting to a 20-year-old
sculptor at Ballarat, Chifley remarked
that he couldn’t see how his bust could
add much to the beauty of the Ballarat
gardens. The P.M. made a cardinal error
in esthetics. If the sculptor does a
great job it will certainly enhance the
beauty of the gardens. Balzac was cer-
tainly no Clark Gable, and in the
dressing-gown which Rodin shoved on
him he looks like some strange medieval
Sorry , Goldie—Mum Wont let me come out and play today.”
monster —so much so that it was 20 years
before Rodin’s work could be put in a
public place without some vandal plaster-
ing it with tar or something. None-
theless, it is as beautiful a piece of sculp-
ture as the Venus de Milo.
* * * *
“Dareb”: Sacrilege, or just a house-
wife’s revolt against the irksome restraints
of rationing? An Adelaide woman, after
tramping the town in a fruitless hunt for
candles, finally entered a church, and
extinguishing and removing three tapers
placed them in her handbag. On her way
out she dropped threepence in the box.
» * * *
“Re”: A large lady burst into the
butcher’s shop and, ignoring the patient
queue, sailed to the counter. “You
didn’t put that leg of pork in my order,”
she accused loudly. We pricked up our
ears. Pork is rarer than smokes
down our way. Shortweight blushed a
fiery red and, with furtive glances to-
wards us, stammered, “Er no. It’s
rationed, you know.” “Rationed, is it!”
declared the irate lady. “Well, let me
tell you something. So will cream be
next Sunday.” Cream —we have for-
gotten the taste. She bounced triumph-
antly from the shop. You’ve guessed it.
She’s the milkman’s wife.
• * * *
“Eureka”: “Macßopus” (B. 11/9/’46)
takes me to task for putting two “m’s”
in Nimmitybelle. I was born there, and
my birth certificate reads “Nimmity-
belle.” In a Government Gazette of
1848 the name is spelt variously as
Nimitybelle, Nimmitybelle, Nimity Bell,
Nimithybale. This variation of spelling
is understandable if it is of aboriginal
origin, but there is no certainty that it
is aboriginal. John Jardine, a pioneer
with an extensive knowledge of
the district, has stated that the name is
a variation of “Inimitable.” In this
locality you will find many settlements
with names spelt in a variety of ways,
simply because of the difficulty of setting
any strict rule for abo, words. Cooma
was once spelt “Coombah.” Bunyan is
not named after John Bunyan, but was
originally spelt “Boonyan” aboriginal
for “pigeons’ resting place.” Adaminaby
was formerly Adamindumee, Monaro has
been spelt “Manaro,” “Maneroo” and
“Manaroo,” and Kiandra was first known
as “Giandarra.”

“Low-pointer”: It may be an old
racket but it’s a good one. A young
man, well-dressed and business-like, in-
troduces himself as the representative of
an electric-light globe concern and says
it requires globes for laboratory pur-
poses. It is willing to replace
yours with new ones at half-price, but
the globes must be in working condition.
He is armed with a magnifying-glass and
after inspecting each globe submitted
makes hurried notes. He inquires how
long the globes have been installed and
if satisfaction has been gained. When
he leaves you are quite pleased with
yourself—new globes for old! Actually
you have merely paid a swindler to swop
your globes at Mrs. Smith’s further
down the street.

“James W.”: When anyone tells you
drowning is a pleasant death refer him
to me. Ditto the bloke who thinks dying
of thirst or freezing to death can be com-
fortable. I’ve had ago at all three, but
apparently was born to be burnt. I was
delirious and down when found on the
thirst count and I still wake up yelling
from dreams of it. I’ve been-hauled out
of a river and out of the sea, unconscious
both times, so I know what drowning is.
If any theorist wants to tell me the agonis-
ing thumping of heart and head and
the tearing agony of air-starved and
water-soused lungs that precede oblivion
are in any way pleasant, he should try it.
Compared with death per refrigeration,
rheumatics and gout are mere ticklings.
Every fibre of a man’s body goes through
its own particular little hell before it
freezes into numbness, and the victim, if
he’s found in time and recovers, forgets
none of them. The road back is a hell
all of its own.
* * * *
“Zake”: The visit to London of the
Moscow “Dynamos,” the Soviet Soccer
team which created history and consider-
able Cockney amusement by presenting
bouquets to its tough English op-
ponents, has inspired a collectivised musi-
cal comedy which is now playing “to de-
lighted audiences in the Soviet capital.”
The villain of the piece is, significantly,
a Pole, sinister manager of a hotel
which is run by the Chelsea Football
Club. It is well known, of course, that
all football clubs in capitalist England
own large hotels, as well as having in-
terests in blancmange foundries, walk-
ing-stick farms, portable post-hole fac-
tories and other forms of big business.
One highlight of the show, which in-
cludes choruses of charwomen and
speeches on Commo ideology, is a
cabaret in which British and Russian
trade officials dance the Highland fling.
Horrifying as this might be, it could have
been worse —they could have had brawny
kilted Scots sitting on their heels doing
the Russian dance. In permitting the
thing to be seen by the citizens of Mos-
cow the Propaganda Department and the
N.K.V.D. have graciously allowed the
visiting Russki footballers to drink the
foaming beer of the hated capitalists,
though they strictly barred an Anglo-
Soviet romance—the mush was supplied
by the team’s centre-forward marrying
the Russian woman pilot of a London-
bound ’plane. Yes, the Pole finishes up
being “liquidated” in the good old Soviet
way.

“Craiser”; Two young men who chose
the sleeping quarters of the nurses at St.
Vincent’s Hospital, Melbourne, for a mid-
night demonstration regretted their deci-
sion. After breaking several window
panes with pennies and other missiles,
they were startled by the eruption of a
dozen nursing ladies at the upper win-
dows who emptied buckets of cold water
on their heads. One youth bolted; the
other sought refuge in a tin shed, there
to be surrounded by an army of
indignant Florence Nightingales armed
with mops, brooms and fresh pails of
water. A police patrol car rescued him.
* * * *
“C.Q.”; A piquant incident brightened
one election meeting in Victoria. The
Liberal candidate was addressing a meet-
ing at North Melbourne Town Hall and
a persistent interjector demanded the right
of free speech. The candidate obligingly
offered him the courtesy of the micro-
phone on the principle that it is always
a good thing to lift the repression. The
interrupter found himself completely
bankrupt of ideas and, after reiterating
for three minutes his demand for free
speech, returned to his seat in confusion.
He was probably representative of 99 out
of 100 mterjectors.

“Bozo”: “O’Yen” (B. 11/9/’46) opens
a sore subject with train travellers. His
sweet young thing should have been in
our carriage the other night—a smoker.
A burly worker just made it in time and
looked in vain for a seat, two-thirds of
them being occupied by women. Picking
on a young girl in the window seat he
thrust a packet of gaspers under her nose
and growled “Have a fag, Miss.” Em-
barrassed, she blushed sweetly and
politely refused. “Go on, take one,” he
persisted, but she shook her head. “No
thank you, I really don’t smoke.” The
generous one hastily shoved the packet
away before someone else took up his
offer and roared “Don’ smoke, eh? Then
what the blazes are you doin’ in this car-
riage ! ”
* * * *
“Spinifex”; It’s a mild heartbreak to
many returned Diggers to stand before
windows of shops selling “disposals” and
view the abundance of hammers at cheap
prices. In 1942, dozens of units went
north and were expected to erect camps
with one or two hammers and a saw.
Somebody forgot to send nails to my
crowd but we managed. A common
sight was a mob of men “hanging around”
the lucky user of the official hammer —
stones and pieces of wood were poor
substitutes.
* * * *
“Math”: There are times when it’s
not safe to bet even when it looks a cert.
A batch of us, dining at Carlyon’s in
Melbourne, had a “book” on diners
ordering pints of beer with their meal.
Entered a grey-haired lady. “Bet ten
to one no beer,” announced the bookie.
“You’re set,” chipped little Joe at my
elbow. Then the surprise—the lady
ordered two pints; one she swamped
down, the other reserved for after dinner.
* * * *
“Frank Mauri”: War’s changing for-
tunes brought a new p.-0.-w. into our
camp at Singapore—an Italian submarine
expert who had been attached to the
Japanese Navy. When Italy hoisted the
white flag and followed it by declaring
war on her former allies, this officer be-
came a prisoner. He had taken part in
the Coral Sea battle. His most striking
story was his account of the Jap ’planes
flying in circles till they dropped into the
sea. Their carriers had been sunk.
* * * *
“R.W.”: The fire that almost de-
stroyed the historic parish church of
All Saints’, Woollahra (Sydney), recalls
that the architect was Edmund Thomas
Blacket, who arrived in Sydney in 1842
en route to New Zealand. He was per-
suaded by Bishop Broughto%and T. S.
Mort to remain. He had made a hobby
of church architecture in England, and
this early interest stood him in good
stead. As well as being appointed
Colonial Architect, he carried on an
extensive private practice. He helped
with the completion of St. Andrew’s
Cathedral, and was the architect of
Sydney University, “the finest ex-
ample of Gothic architecture in Aus-
tralia.” He also designed St. George’s
Cathedral, Perth, part of Trinity College,
Melbourne, Christ Church, Geelong, and
over 80 churches and cathedrals. All
Saints’, Woollahra, St. Thomas’s, North
Sydney, and St. Mary’s, West Maitland,
are the best of his parish churches.
SQUATTERS.
Strange, is it not, unquestionably strange
How meanings of a word will chop and change,
Rising from something like opprobrium
Or slightingness to presently become
A label signifying nothing less
Than enviable consequentialness ?
And then again sustain a sad descent
To just what was originally meant.-
The first, the very first of all of those
Termed squatters was the Devil, I suppose,
Who snaked his way into the space assigned
To the progenitors of humankind
And there was found (if Milton you believe)
“Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve” —
A monumentally calamitous
Event for her, for Adam and for us.
But, setting Holy Writ (and myth) aside,
You’ll find the name of squatter first applied
In English law to anyone who planned
A raid upon a scrap of “common” land,
Shoved up a shack thereon ’twixt eve and
dawn
And gained a title not to be withdrawn.
Poor as church mice were they, or Burns’s
cotters,
The chaps who first were designated squatters.
Slowly but sure you’ll note the word advance
To high estate from insignificance. \
The poor plebeian squatter, once a thing
Of naught, emerges as a shepherd king,
A lord of flocks and herds, by all consent
The sturdy backbone of a continent.
What’s in a name? Proverbially not
Much, but in what it signifies a lot.
And now again, you cannot but admit.
The term depreciates above a bit.
Who upon hitting headlines now persist?
Ah, not the grazier or the pastoralist,
But they who, mostly homeless, get their names
In print by jumping residential claims,
Their hands across the seas and centuries
joined
With those for whom the label first was coined.

T. THE R.


“Philp”: Will someone either verify
the following phenomenon or explain it
—so far everyone 1 have consulted has
simply told me to take less rum with
my water? In the centre of the Sydney
harbor bridge there is a large diamond-
shaped red neon light, plain for all to
see. At each end of the bridge, how-
ever, there are two muzzy blue lights
and the interesting point about ’em is that
when you stare directly at them they
disappear. Tear your gaze away, or look
at anything else in the vicinity, and the
tantalising blue glow immediately in-
trudes into the edge of your vision.
Switch your eyes back again to try to
fix their exact position and the damn’
things vanish. I have at least one witness
to verify what I say, but the only ex-
planation I can extract from anyone is
that I took him to the pub before pre-
senting the evidence.

“Frank Mauri”: The position of a
British lance-corporal (B. 10/7 / ’46) was
brought home to some of us shortly after
we landed in Malaya. A pub brawl
having started among some British regu-
lars, a lance-corporal tried to quieten
things down, but got mixed up in the
scrap. Then a squad of Tommy M.Ps.
poured in. As usual, they hit first and
asked questions afterwards. The lance-
jack was on the floor and about to get
his issue when one of the M.Ps. saw his
stripe. “Don’t hit un; un be lance-
corporal!” he yelled.
* * * *
“Bo”; Many who saw and heard
Georges Thill during his Australian
tour and compared the power, resonance
and easy delivery of his chest register
with the apparently hard work he made
of producing ringing head notes must
have wondered whether the French
tenor’s voice hadn’t been forced from a
natural baritone. The human voice is a
peculiar instrument, often a hairsbreadth
dividing the tonal categories into which
it might eventually fall. One of the most
“ Let's give .it a fly, Martha. If it DOES coma home at a Hundred to one
We can buy the vicar a new bicycle."
remarkable examples of a late change of
voice was that of Fernand Ansseau, the
Belgian tenor, whose voice Ernest
Newman likened to fine violin playing.
At the outbreak of the war in 1914 Ans-
seau was completing his training as a
baritone at the Brussels Conservatorium.
During the German occupation—the
swiftness of the German advance
rendered escape from the city impossible
—he continued his study of opera, and
in this period his teacher detected the in-
fusion into his voice of true tenor
quality. Within a few months of this dis-
covery he was taking high C with ease.
So it was that the erstwhile baritone
emerged in the spring of 1919 as leading
tenor for the gala reopening of the
Theatre de la Monnaie, where Melba
made her debut 32,years before.
* * * *
“Squizz”: According to those who
should know, war is now a subject that
people no longer discuss. War films,
war plays, war books are currently re-
garded in Australia as “dead meat.” Yet
this cannot be altogether true or else
every man is at heart a small boy, judg-
ing by the crowd which is always rubbing
its collective nose against the windows
of a Melbourne civilian and military
tailor. Among his gents’ suitings the
scissors merchant displays a left-over
from the war years when his customers
were seeking more martial patterns —an
extremely complete and well-colored
chart of medal ribbons. They range from
the V.C. to the Iron Cross, from the Hitler
war’s “Aircrew over Europe” campaign
ribbon to the decoration signifying that
the wearer was in the Matabele War.
There’s even the orange riband that was
awarded to the Dutch on mobilisation.
No less varied are the types of Aus-
tralians that the display attracts —I know,
because I have shouldered my way
through them to stare at all the ribbons
I once thought I would win!

“K.G.C.”: This argument about
Treasure Island (B. 11/9/’46) would
not have arisen had it not been for
Edward Alexander Vidler, who died in
Melbourne a few years ago. R.L.S.
brought the cuttings from “Young Folks,”
in which the yarn was titled “The Sea
Cook,” to W. E. Henley. They were passed
on to Vidler, then a lad on the staff, to
read. Vidler took the scrapbook home
and was enthralled. It was his enthusiasm
that led the firm to offer Stevenson £lOO
for the MS. Cassells gave R.L.S. a new
agreement with handsome royalties, and
the success of the book led Rider Haggard
to write King Solomon’s Mines. Vidler
was engaged for years in the publishing
business in Melbourne and did much to
encourage writers.

“Sun-gazer”: Dead unlucky was the
motorist who stopped outside our local
garage and called for a couple of gallons.
The attendant removed the petrol cap
and reached for the bowser hose when —
woof! the car’s fuel tank went up in
flames. Other attendants put in some good
work with fire extinguishers before too
much damage was done, but the car was
a sorry sight. A lounger on a near-by
corner had seen the whole thing and ex-
plained, Somebody had thrown a cigar-
ette butt from a passing tram. The odds
against that bumper finding its way into
the two-inch petrol vent just as the cap
was removed would probably stagger
Einstein himself.
* * * ♦
“Youanmi”: Mention of R.A.A.F.
Catalinas (B. 18/9/’46) reminds me that
one little idiosyncrasy of their crews was
a strong affection for their cap badges.
As the wearers were generally near salt
water or in its spray, the badges soon
changed from shining gilt to the dull green
of verdigris ; the greener the badge, the
prouder the wearer. One skipper came
home on leave and, while he slept, an
attentive and devoted wife overhauled
his clothes and scrubbed his cap badge
with toothbrush and metal polish in an
attempt to restore the original gilt. It
was a worse offerujg than scouring the
patina off an ancient bronze, but she
managed to repair some of the damage
by dabbing the badge with vinegar. Air
•
Force wives were a nuisance in that re-
spect—they could never appreciate those
old “1000-hour” lids with frayed peaks
and tattered sides that drooped towards
your ears. The young aircrew bloke’s
treatment of a new cap generally con-
sisted of ripping the cane or metal stiffener
out, nearly pulling the peak off, in an at-
“Far be it from me to condemn certain parishioners, Mrs. Crocus,
bur"—
tempt to soften it, and then pressing the
tile between his knees until it was hope-
lessly out of shape. Then it was at least
ready to be worn and knocked about until
it acquired the authentic brand of age. In-
cidentally, Army blokes always seemed a
little stuffy about their caps—l never
saw one that even looked as though it
had been kicked around or had a pint of
beer served in it.
* * * *
“Fancar”: Though the blitz destroyed
many London literary shrines, some relics
of literary interest escaped. In pre-war
London there still remained two of
Wren’s galleried churches, St. Bride’s,
Fleet-street, and Christ Church, Newgate.
St. Bride’s is gone and Christ Church,
which abutted on Christ’s Hospital, the
Blue-coat school of Coleridge and Lamb,
is roofless and battered. But despite the
extensive damage the bust of Charles
Lamb was unscarred, and beneath the
rubble behind the old altar rails was
found the gravestone of Boyer, the Christ
Hospital master immortalised by Lamb.
Inscription on the stone is still legible,
and its preservation and that of Lamb’s
bust make the Elian description of Boyer
happily applicable to Hitler: “His
thunder rolled innocuous for us; his
storms came near but never touched us.”
* * * *
“Bondi Beachcomber”: One item of
equipment carried by Jap soldiers had
our fellows stumped. A cylindrical piece
of bamboo about 3in. by it had
tiny Jap characters carved into one end.
Intelligence identified it as a name-stamp.
Evidently so many of the coolie class
Nips were illiterate that they had been
provided with the means of stamping
their names. It was only' part of the
conglomeration of odds and ends carried
in the yards of cloth worn wound round
the Jap’s middle. Other things in it
were carved wooden idols, silk flags,
prayers printed on paper strips, porno-
graphic pictures, “Aeroplane” brand
cigarettes, and a silk bag containing clip-
pings of hair and nails from dead com-
rades. Presumably the latter were to be
sent to the dead ones’ relatives when the
opportunity occurred.

“D.”; The brevity with which Mr.
Louis dispatched Mr. Mauriello was not
matched by the announcer who intro-
duced the fighters. After the traditional
verbose introduction he came out with
“May the better participant emerge tri-
umphantly.” Still, I suppose that is more
grammatically correct than “May the best
man win.”

“C.Q.”: She got the Royal Humane
Society’s most exclusive award, the Clarke
gold medal, from the hands of Herring,
C.J., in Melbourne, and the C.J. re-
marked “One cannot help getting a lump
in the throat on such occasions.” She is
Mrs. Williams, of North Ballarat, the
23-year-old wife of an ex-serviceman, an
oxy-welder and panel-builder. The Adel-
aide express was approaching a level
crossing at 50 miles an hour, and Mrs.
Williams saw two children, one two
years and the other 18 months, toddling
towards it. She dashed through a wire
fence, pushed the older child off the per-
manent way and returned for the
other. She grabbed it in her arms and
rolled down the embankment just ahead
of the rushing monster. It was the first
time since 1935 and only the third time
in 72 years that the medal had been
awarded to a woman, “It was a bit too
close,” the heroine said, “and I felt a bit
sick afterwards,” If she had been wearing
one of the new swimsuits she would no
doubt have got her picture into all the
dailies.
“R. Volt”: Bare Island Fort, La
Perouse, now a home for Army and
Navy veterans, was part of Australia’s
defence system when I knew it. It was
also a source of solace for cablemen on
the mainland. There was rigid discipline
at the cable station, and the nearest pub,
five miles away at Botany, was out of
bounds. Bare Island, IQO yards from the
station, and separated from the mainland
by a strait of only a few yards crossed
by a bridge, had a canteen. The garrison
of one kindly old sergeant and four men
were always glad to see visitors, and it
was easy to slip across in the evenings
under the nose of even the most lynx-
eyed cable superintendent. No gun was
ever fired from the fort during my two
years’ sojourn, though a sharp lookout
was kept for the shoals of kingfish that
helped to supplement the Army ration.
* * * *
“Spokeshave”: At the all-model show
at Melbourne Town Hall I had a con-
vincing demonstration of the modern
kid’s obsession for engineering science.
Hundreds of children were gaping at the
models of railway systems, mining opera-
tions, corvettes, tanks, speedboats, aero-
planes and whatnot, things which in-
terest me little. Then a stentorian voice
invited the youngsters to attend a lecture
on the evolution of ocean transport illus-
trated with models of all sorts of craft.
The narrator gave a fascinating descrip-
tion of the progress of marine construc-
tion from the dugout through the Roman
trireme, the Viking ship, the Spanish gal-
leon, Drake’s Golden Hind, Bligh’s
Bounty, Cook’s Endeavour, the tea
clippers, the first and last five-masted
ship up to the Queen Mary and the en-
thralling adventures that befell them. It
was so absorbing to an oldster that I
never noticed till it was finished that not
more than a couple of dozen of the
younger generation had been tempted
away from the mechanical gadgets.

“W.P.T.”; At Cronulla (N.S.W.) re-
cently there was a good illustration of
the power of the sea, when waves de-
stroyed a large building , and seriously
threatened surf club house. A better
illustration of just how powerful the sea
can be at times is to be had at North
Bondi. There on a flat ledge of rock
rests a large piece of sandstone, 20ft.
long, 16ft, wjde and 10ft. high, weighing
235 tons, which was thrown up from
the seabed and deposited on the ledge
on July 15, 1912. There have been many
severe storms since then and every sea
washes against this rock, but it has not
moved an inch in 34 years. Severe dam-
age was done to property all along the
coast during that storm,

“Seaforth”: While I was waiting' for
a bus a flash car glided smoothly to the
kerb and the prosperous-looking cove at
the wheel asked “Want a lift to town?”
I hopped in and we hadn’t travelled far
when the driver, whom I recognised as
an important personage in the com-
mercial world, cadged a smoke. As we
approached the Harbor Bridge I offered
to pay the toll. “Not at all,” said the
driver. “Give us another fag and we’ll
call it square.” As he dropped me out-
side my office I thanked him for the
lift. “That’s okay, old boy,” was the
answer. “I was dying for a smoke and
I took the chance you’d have a couple
when I picked you up.”
THE LATEST.
“If there are differences and disagreements between
the great and small Powers, we must find means to
iron them out.’'— Molotov, at Paris.
These homely metaphors that statesmen use
To stress their points and illustrate their views
Are mostly stale.
Some of our mentors regularly choose
To tell us at “exploring avenues”
They’ll never fail.
A worn and hackneyed phrase, let me suggest,
That should be mercifully laid to rest.
{
Others again, you’ve doubtless often learned,
Are strenuous souls who’ll “leave no stone
unturned”
To make it clearer
They’re not the sort to stick at anything
Which, they anticipate, is apt to bring
Utopia nearer.
A musty platitude, I frankly own,
That makes me struggle to suppress a groan.
And here’s the latest cliche, so to speak,
That soon you’ll hear in accents bold or meek,
But mostly maunder-y,
A figure of speech—a metaphor, let’s say,
Which ought to hit our housewives anyway—
Straight from the laundry.
From many a forum soon they’ll talk about
The job of “ironing differences out.”

And experience is the essence of
Babcock service to steam users
throughout Australia.
For seventy-five years the name of
Babcock & Wilcox has been inti-
mately associated with the develop-
ment of steam generating equipment
... Babcock engineers in every con-
tinent have studied the individual
problems confronting each type of
industry and Babcock technicians
have kept pace with each progressive
phase of equipment design by con-
stant research into the physical,
chemical and metallurgical aspects
of materials and processes.

THE SERVICE MAN
DID "Labor" Save Us?
“Ek Dum”; The most wicked fraud
ever perpetrated on the Australian elec-
tors is the claim of the “ ‘Labor’ Gov-
ernment” at Canberra that it Saved the
Country. Proof is wholly wanting. In
the months of peril did any “Labor”
leader fly to the post of danger and
address the people in soul-stirring
language? None did.
Throughout the Lyons - Menzies -
Fadden period of office “Labor” acted as
a brake on every move to strengthen de-
fence or increase the country’s fighting
power. When circumstances forced co-
operation the “Labor” programme always
called for something less than the
Menzies Government’s proposals, even
the proposal for a national register. To
this Mr, Ward counselled resistance, and
Mr.. Curtin plumped for a “voluntary
register” ( Hansard , May 28, 1940, p.
1365):
I thought then, and I still think, that a
voluntary register would have produced
JOHN CURTIN’S GRAVE.
John Curtin, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, died on July 5, 1945, and was
buried in Karrakatta (Perth) cemetery. On the anniversary of the national funeral,
as the “West Australian” recorded, there was a Labor procession to the “unpretentious
grave”; memorial speeches were made; “the Australian flag above the grave was
lowered to half-mast”; wreaths were laid (one for the Labor movement, another
for the Federal Parliamentary Labor party, another for the State Labor Government,
and several others for A.L.P. district councils and other organisations “and by indi-
viduals”); “the flag was then raised to the masthead and the graveside ceremony ended
less than a quarter of an hour after it began.” It was announced that there would
be an annual pilgrimage to the grave. Before the next one there should be a head-
stone at least; if necessary, at the cost of the nation.. A recent visitor could find no
flag or wreaths, the only means of identification being “an envelope and a card weighed
down by a stone,” to which were added “six empty pickle-bottles and another bottle
with two feeble sprays of Geraldton wax-flower.” There has evidently been some
slight alteration since.
500,000 to 600,000 names, and would have
contained information as to what training
the men had had • • • • .
Mr. Gregory: Would you leave the de-
fence of Australia to volunteers?
Mr. Curtin: I do leave it to volunteers.
The nation has never failed to produce all
the volunteers that it has ever sought. -
In the same speech Mr. Curtin op-
posed the building of the Sydney naval
dock on the ground that he “could not
find in what way it could be related to
Australia’s defence.” And he resisted all
overtures for the formation of a national
Government, though Mr. Menzies offered
to efface himself and serve under him.
Occasionally, in his fashion, Mr.
Curtin tried to be fair. On May 28,
1941, for example ( Hansard, p. 25):
The war has been prosecuted to the
maximum of Australia’s capacity, and I
doubt if any great improvements could
have been made upon what has been done.
I have been in association with Minis-
ters who have given their maximum service
to problems confronting Australia. The
Advisory War Council and the Govern-
ment have gripped with problems in a way
which I believe has been as satisfactory as
was possible in the circumstances Dur-
ing the past four months there has been
a vigorous development of the policy for
which the Prime Minister himself stands.
In August, 1941, the “Labor” leader
described the Australian war effort as
“vast.”
Dr. Evatt Is Incredulous
“Labor” had been engaged in pleading
the cause of two Communists, Ratliff
and Thomas, who had been interned after
being convicted of being involved in a
large-scale Communist plan to sabotage
the war effort. the strikes m
munition factories, implemented by
members of the Communist Central
Committee to enforce the release of these
two Communists, “Labor” said not a
word. It pooh-poohed the idea of
greater peril being in store. Exactly 15
weeks before Japan struck Dr. Evatt
was heard to this effect:
I have said publicly and I now repeat
that between August 8 and August 12
[1941] the possibility of war with Japan
was exaggerated. My colleague, Mr.
Forde, has referred to the make-believe
and the build-up. The situation was sup-
posed to be deteriorating hour by hour
and day by day. That was an untrue
build-up an exaggeration a mis-
leading impression; the situation, so far
from deteriorating, actually improved. Dr.
Page repeated the statement that Aus-
tralia was in imminent danger of invasion.
An exaggeration 1 say again an
atmosphere of alarm ought not to have
been created.
It is now known, the United States
Government having issued a bulky
pamphlet on the subject, complete with
intercepted Tokyo messages, that, with
the breaking of the Jap codes a few days
before this confident statement, it had
been established beyond all doubt that
Japan intended war. This was the basis
of Mr. Menzies’s warning, so raucously
condemned by Dr. Evatt.
The Volte Face
Within a few months “Labor,” taking
office per favor of Mr. Wilson and Mr.
Coles —both now in lucrative Govern-
ment positions —two months before
Japan struck at Pearl Harbor, had the
impertinence to hold itself up as the only
authentic prophet of calamity. And in
spite of Mr. Curtin’s indiscreet praise of
the Menzies-Fadden Government’s “vast
war effort and his claim that he had col-
laborated in it, he had the temerity to
come out in his 1943 policy speech with
the following pernicious nonsense:
Blind to the dangers in the Pacific, the
Menzies and Fadden Governments left
Australia very much unprepared. the
essentials for defence in the hands or
commanders, as the result of the previous
Government’s policy, were so sadly in-
adequate that only a limited disposition
of forces could be made. But the Labor
Government rejected that concept. In asso-
ciation with the commanders, it developed
a plan to prevent this great country being
doomed. It rejected the concept that the
little islands to the north of Australia
should be taken, that upper Queensland
and Darwin should be overrun.
It is almost impossible to believe that
this untruthful rubbish could have issued
from the mouth of the spokesman of a
party who had opposed tooth and nail
the extension of compulsory service to
New Guinea in September, 1939;
We say that there should be no conscrip-
tion of the Australian people for . d f ten f®
of Australia’s overseas territories which may
be described as extra-territorial to the
continent of Australia. We say that they
ought to be defended by forces volun-
tarily recruited. '
In August, 1941, Mr. Forde had
aroused Dr. Evatt’s admiration by tus
scornful attack on the Prime Minister for

Australia Loses Big Orders
Because of the Communist inspired ban
on shipping to the Netherlands Indies* the
Dutch have bought in America, for cash,
£14,500,000 worth of goods Australia
could have supplied. Thirty thousand
tons of flour was one item, whilst substan-

Denmark.
The vicious activities of the Com-
munist Party are solely responsible
for the strangling of this valuable
export trade.
Export trade is vital to the development
of the sound and healthy industries that
would be capable of supporting thousands
of Australian families in the future.
Is it not futile to talk of full employment
whilst permitting a few malcontents to
destroy the means of providing it?

warning the people of the Japanese
danger. Placed at the head of the Army,
he was described by Mr. Menzies as
“now heavily disguised as a ruthless and
efficient Army administrator —the Bill
Adams who saved the day.” He proposed
to train raw recruits to battle standard
in three weeks!
And the whole shooting-box of
“Labor” Ministers, who had again and
again strenuously resisted the sending of
any but volunteers to man the islands
outside Australia, left compulsorily
enlisted militia, half-trained, quarter-
armed and in entirely inadequate num-
bers, to be cut to pieces in Rabaul by
vastly superior Japanese forces. There
was another slaughter of militia beyond
the Owen Stanleys before the Japanese
advance to lorabaiwa.
Militia, too, scarcely knowing which
end of a rifle was which, were flung
hurriedly to the defence of Milne Bay.
But the Government did not hang its
head at its own inconsistencies, even
though it was sometimes as obdurate on
the militia question after the Japanese
war broke out as before, if political ex-
pediency called.
“Alone He Did It!”
Thus, at the most crucial period of
early 1942 General Wavell was given
command of an area which reached down
to Derby and to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Within his command there were 20,000
Australian troops in the northern area,
but 15,000 of them were militia. And
the Government which before then had
sacrificed militia in Rabaul, in an area
into which it had declared militia
should never be sent, flatly refused to
agree that militia should be taken to
the Dutch islands, if necessary, to hold
back the enemy and prevent blood
being shed on Australian soil. It
had no qualms about allowing A.I.F.
men who had borne the brunt of heavy
fighting in the Middle East to be sacri-
ficed there. While it was standing in this
mulish attitude it was shrieking to
harassed Britain and America to send 25
divisions to defend Australian soil.
Later on, when there was no emerg-
ency, when the Allies were on the offen-
sive instead of the defensive, and when
it was obvious that only a small propor-
tion of militia would be needed for the
island campaigns, “Labor” agreed to ex-
tend militia-usage boundaries beyond
Australia, though not so far that the
“conscripts” could be used for purposes
for which an Administration with
an ounce of spirit would have used every
able-bodied man, every rifle, ship and air-
craft in the continent —the rescue of the
men who died in Sandakan, the relief of
the men taken in Singapore.
This, however, was not the end of
“Labor’s” effrontery. Before it took
office it had denounced compulsory ser-
vice. Having doubled the number of men
and women in the services by the use of
compulsory service and having extended
civilian compulsory service in the Prus-
sian form to every man and woman in
Australia “Labor’s” leader raised a
triumphant shout in 1943, amid a chorus
of praise from his followers:
When Labor took office 430,000 men
were in the fighting services. To-day the
figure is 820,000.
All, of course, caught up by conscription
except for the A.1.F., presently to be
merged in the A.M.F., despite its indig-
nant protests.
“Labor” boasted of this in the face of
its own pledges against compulsion and
of Mr. Curtin’s pronouncement of
November 16, 1939, that the Menzies
Government “affronts the patriotism of
the Australian people by the imposition
of compulsory training: there is no justi-
fication for compulsory training.”
With the 430,000 men enlisted under
the Menzies-Fadden regime the best part
of four fighting divisions were maintained
at battle strength, magnificently assisted
by the Navy and the R.A.A.F. overseas.
With the Curtin-Chifley’s 820,000, which
became more than 900,000 in the end,
not mpre could be done, and less was
done toward the end. And even then
veterans who had seen six years’ ser-
vice were kept in the frontline. In
many cases they were placed under
company officers and non-coms, from
mainland militia camps.
Under the Menzies scheme fighting
services were fighting services. There
were not tens of thousands of a.w.l.
youths from camps in which the same old
things were done week after week, month
after month and year after year. There
were no non-combatant units for “sports”
—boxers, bookmakers, footballers —to
* serve” in. There were no large forma-
tions eating their hearts out in idleness.
Many of the faults and failures of
which “Labor” stood and stands guilty
were here outlined last week. Sacrifice
of forces which could have been saved;
sacrifice of' inexperienced troops on
hopeless missions; failure to provide
against tropical diseases which numbered
100,000 victims ; breakdown of the “de-
fences” of Darwin at the first test. The
inadequacy of these “defences” was so
obvious that the women and children
should have been got out of Darwin
before any raid took place.
Yet there are still other counts on
which “Labor” could be impeached. What
can be thought of a party whose leader
impressed on his predecessors the vital
necessity of providing an armored force,
whose “Government” spent £30,000,000
on armored organisation and equipment
without building even one usable tank,
and which saw the armored division
eventually disbanded after its men, die
flower of the Army, had been cooling
their heels for years remote from the
point of danger?
Communist Associations
What can be said of a Government
which chose as advisers union bosses
like the Communist Thornton, known
to “Labor” as a member of the Central
Committee of the Communist party? Of
a “Government” which maintained a
“trade-union advisory committee,” com-
posed for the most part of Communist-
party officials, during the most crucial
period of the war? The “Government ’
had secret conferences with these fellows
at which it took them into its confidence
about its war measures, and it allowed
them to dictate that servicemen in the
Munitions and other departments must
join Communist-controlled unions, even
soldiers who had fought in Libya and
Greece and at El Alamein. In the result
such men were obliged to pay union fees
and submit to the rule of a Communist
ruffian who had written in the Com-
munist official organ:
If the thieves of Australia should wage
war against the robbers of Japan, then it
will be the duty of the Australian workers
to present a united front against both.
Later on he boasted that he had made
strikes in munition factories his “busi-
ness” —this while the battles of Libya,
Greece, Syria and Britain were being
fought and while our men were still in
Tobruk.
If returned soldiers did not obey
the “Government’s” join-the-union edict
they were placed in an inferior class on
lower rates of tea money and overtime
than union members.
Now the Government which was guilty
of all these things has the audacity to
ask for support on the ground that its
members are heroes whose determination
and perspicacity saved the country. And
it is doing this while (under Communist
pressure) reverting to its pre-war shirker
policy.
Collapse of the Defences
Twelve months after the end of the
Japanese war “Labor” has allowed the
coal industry and shipping to fall into
a condition which would spell disaster —
since there are no strategic reserves —
in case of attack. It has brought the
Army down with a bump to an “interim”
strength of 39,000. Northern defences
have ceased to exist —in the Seventh
Military District, of which Darwin is
the centre, there is not now a single real
fighting soldier, the battalion-odd of
troops there being purely administrative.
The facilities built during the war are
being allowed to decay.
Air Vice-Marshal Bostock, whom
General Kenney, General MacArthur’s
air commander, described as “a loyal,
efficient and courageous colleague,” has
pictured the ruin to which the R.A.A.F.
has been brought in a single year:
To-day there is not a single fully-
equipped combat squadron in Australia.
The basic ground and operational frame-
work of the force —built by herculean effort
over six years of war —has been allowed to
disintegrate.
Essential communications between opera-
tional bases have been dismantled.
The field radar organisation has been
destroyed.
The most expert advice available has
been swept aside.
The people are still paying millions for
an Air Force which simply doesn’t exist as
an organisation fit for the swift transfer
to an operational footing in an emergency.
All this policy of destruction of de-
fence exactly suits the book of the Com-
munist union leaders who have influenced
the shifts and changes of “Labor” policy
on defence, and who now aim at the
weakening of every country except
Russia.
Australians can thank their stars that
“Labor” was not at the helm when the
policy of these union leaders was to make
peace with Russia’s ally, Germany, on
the ground that, the booty of German
aggression having been divided, there was
nothing left to fight for.

PERSONAL ITEMS
A redoubtable fighter died when John
Richards Harris, M.L.C., passed over at 78
at Rutherglen (Vic.)- As Minister of Edu-
cation and Health in the Dunstan Govern-
ment from 1935 to 1942, he stubbornly
opposed forms of social amelioration
which he regarded as mollycoddling, and
when a plea was put for warmer class-
rooms he cited his own student days
when he burnt the midnight oil in
a freezing attic. A doctor him-
self—he practised at Rutherglen and
served as an M.O. in the Great
War—he fought the medical profession
on the bacteriological theory of disease,
and once challenged a Tasmanian
Minister for Health to submit himself
to a human guinea-pig test. Born at
Chiltern, Harris was educated at Grenville
College, Ballarat, and Melbourne Uni.
Elected M.L.C. and becoming an
honorary Minister in the Allan-Peacock
regime in 1925, he fought his party
executive on a pledge he refused to sign
and was threatened with expulsion. As a
vigneron Harris produced a well-known
wine known as John’s Port. He was
knighted in 1937,
One-time sailor, soldier and airman,

Brisbane Grammar, joined the R.A.N.R.
as an ordinary seaman. He was com-
missioned in 1920 and retired with the
rank of lieut.-commander in 1932.
When the whips cracked in 1939 George
saw little chance of getting to sea with,
the Navy, so he enlisted in the A.I.F. as
a private. Just as he had reached com-
missioned rank he was called up by the
RA.A.F. as an aircraftman. After do-
ing a good job in the islands as intelli-
gence officer, he went to Malaya in time
to get in and out of trouble there —his
piloting of a badly-holed' ship with 100
or so airmen and soldiers out of Sumatra,
where they made a successful getaway
from Palembang, is an epic. Back in
Australia again, he became staff officer.

Eighty-three-year-old Chaplain G. W.
Kendrew was the oldest man present at
the reunion social, of Boer War Veterans,
held early this month in Adelaide, but
there were others not far behind him.
There are over 300 survivors of the men
who fought Cronje and Kruger in the
Adelaide association ; 140 of them turned
up for the reunion and 60 stood bare-
headed at Adrian Jones’s fine Boer War
Memorial on North-terrace for the
annual service in memoiy of those who
fell. Padre Kendrew took the service.
Henry Wallace, who was hit by the
headlines of the world’s press for a week
and handed’his time by President Tru-
man, will probably go down in American
history as a man who missed the ’bus.
Son and grandson of newspapermen of
lowa in the mid-west —they ran “Wallaces’
Farmer” and Henry edited it himself for
some years—he was made Secretary of
Agriculture in Roosevelt’s New Deal team
in 1933. In this job he was responsible
for A.A.A., with its policy of “kill the
little pigs” and “ploughing in,” and he be-
came one of the big men of the Demo-
cratic party. F.D.R. regarded Wallace as
one of his righthand men, and when he
stood for his third term in 1940 he chose
him as his running partner for Vice-Presi-
dent, and after Pearl Harbor placed him
in charge of the Economic Defence Board.
By 1944 opposition to Wallace within the
party had grown too strong and Roose-
velt was forced to drop him in favor of
Truman. Had Roosevelt died a few
months earlier, Wallace would have suc-
ceeded him at the White House. Ameri-
can politics are unpredictable, but it is
unlikely that the man from lowa will
ever make a comeback. He was a front-
seat rider on the Roosevelt bandwagon.
and his dismissal from the Commerce
Department removes the last of the
original New Dealers.

baller, he went to Melbourne from
Albury to study medicine, but before he
took his degrees he put in some time
teaching at Geelong Grammar. After he
left the A.I.F. he switched to the Navy ;
that was in 1920. Flinders Naval Depot,
from whose mess he will soon be retiring,
will remember Henderson as a declaimer
of Henry Lawson’s verses and, despite
advancing years and expanding waist-
line, a tough opponent on the tennis
court. Woolcott has depicted him com-
plete with cigarette holder ; he would be
incomplete without it.
James Jeans, dead in England at 69,
leaves behind him a lasting reputation in
real scientific achievement and a batch
of books of “popular” science whose
sales and popularity have never been
equalled. In 1905 Woodrow Wilson,
then Principal of Princeton Univer-
sity, was attracted by his work on
the Quantum Theory while a lecturer in
mathematics at Cambridge and beckoned
him across the Atlantic to become
Professor of Applied Maths at
Princeton. Four years later Cam-
bridge coaxed him back again. In
1919 Jeans became secretary of the
Royal Society and held the position
until 1929, after which his time was de-
voted to writing books designed to bring
a scientific knowledge of the universe to
the common man. Best known of these
are The Mysterious Universe and The
Stars in Their Courses. Universities and
scientific bodies scrambled to have Jeans
on their lecture programmes, and he held
honorary degrees of Oxford, Manchester,
Aberdeen, St. Andrews, Dublin and John
Hopkins (U.S.A.).
Captain W. Moodie-Heddle adds a
postscript: —-
My old ship Katoomba (B. 24/7/ ’46) was
never a hospital ship, but for a time was
an Imperial transport', sailing between New
York and Liverpool, also the Mediterranean
and Black Sea. She was the first transport
through the Dardanelles after the First World
War, and the first ship into Constantinople and
Batoum. With the aid of the Malwa, of the
P. & Q. Line, and one or two other trans-
ports, we landed 35,000 British soldiers in
Batoum to protect and repair the oil pipe-
line to Baku, but we had eventually to haul
out. We had Lord Milne on several of our
trips, tte was an old schoolmate of mine,
and I had lunch with him on the shores of
the Bosphorus in a fine house he had acquired
from the German occupants —Krupps agents.
I joined the Katoomba when she was building
in Harland and Woolf’s yard, Belfast, in July,
1913, and left her when I retired from the sea
23 years later. She was a ship that never had
an accident, and I still regard her as the finest
passenger boat ever to run on the Australian
coast.
Since Vernon Jones’s show, a second
“unofficial” war artist has turned up in
Melbourne —Ray Parkin, ex-petty officer,
R.A.N., who has been showing a pictorial
“diary of freedom and captivity” at the
Velasquez. The story starts in April,
1939, on a merchant ship taking 600 Aus-
tralians to Portsmouth, and continues on
H.M.A.S. Perth right through that gal-
lant ship’s fighting career. When she
was sunk, Parkin and his pencil and ten
companions took to a lifeboat picked up
from a sunken Japanese transport, and
were 300 miles on their way to Java when
they were captured. Followed incarcera-
tion at Bandoeng for five months, next
to Makasura, then to Thailand and the
Bangkok-Siam railway. Parkin and his
pencil survived that ordeal, then were
shipped to Moji; three vessels of the con-
voy were torpedoed, five scuppered in a
typhoon and his own was burnt nearly to
the waterline. Parkin’s pencil continued
to be busy while he worked for 12
months in a coalmine; then came capi-
tulation and the pencil was able to operate
among the scenic beauties of Japan with-
out concealment. Parkin owes it to
Lieut.-Col. E. E. Dunlop, who opened
his show, that he has most of the sketches
left behind in Java and Thailand.

tinctions. Langdon Bonython, of the
Adelaide “Advertiser,” one of the original
Commonwealth Ms.H.R., was the first to
get a title. Son Lavington Bonython
earned one, too, on municipal work. His
sister acquired one by marrying Angas
Parsons, S.A. Judge. Lavington’s
daughter (wife of K. C. Wilson, former
Federal Senator and Liberal candidate
for Wakefield) was in the last Honors
List; and “Kym” is his son.
Another overseas key job goes to an
Australian, J. F! Foster, registrar of Mel-
bourne University, having been appointed
secretary to the Universities Bureau of the
British Empire in London. F. H. John-
ston, the new registrar, has been on the
university staff for two decades. A-quali-
fied accountant and a graduate in Arts
and Commerce, he will manage the affairs
of over 7000 students.
Retiring as Adelaide manager of the
Bank of Adelaide, Reginald Ridings has
held that post for 12 years, and been
associated with the bank since 1904.
He joined the staff after returning from
the Boer War and was a branch manager
at 27. He graduated to the manager’s
chair in succession to William John Mas-
son.
When the R.A.A.F. quitted Mel-
bourne Showgrounds after six years’
occupancy and it was decided to
hold the first post-war show this
month, the biggest headache in the c' .y
was in the possession of Louis Monod.
Mcßeath visited the showgrounds a few
days before the moving-in of the giant
mangelwurzels, the Clydesdales and the
Shetlands, and his sketch suggests that the
ache hadn’t altogether subsided. The
gigantic production, however, was already
in good shape to face the rising of the
curtain. Born in Ballarat 54 years ago.
SHOW SECRETARY.
Louis Monod joined the R.A.S. as a
clerk, and as secretary has barbered 14
annual outbreaks. His wife is chief
stewardess of the Women’s Associations.
A. H. Greenham, secretary to the De-
partment of Agriculture, is returning to
S.A.’s London office as secretary. He
was there for 12 years, 1926-38, after
four years’ service in the A.I.F. Back in
Adelaide with the Fuel Control Board, he
went off again with the R.A.A.F. to the
Middle East and Italy, finishing as
squadron-leader.
Walter Bunning, caught here by
Dubois in the act of explaining his pet
scheme for making St. Mary’s, a war-
time industrial centre on South Creek,
about 30 miles from Sydney, into a
model satellite town, is chairman of the
N.S.W. Town and Country Planning Ad-
visory Committee. St. Mary’s offers
great scope for the town-planner. The
factories, formerly munition, now turned
over to private firms for industrial use,
are apart from the residential area ; war-
time housing was of a temporary nature
and must be replaced by permanent
homes ; there is plenty of land available,
and the local authorities are prepared to
listen to new ideas. Bunning is a Sydney
architect who has studied in Britain,
Europe and America, and, apart from
town-planning, or hand in hand with it,
his favorite hobby is preaching Aus-
tralian-type homes for Australian con-
ditions. His book Homes in the Sun is
based on this text. Averaging several
inches over the fathom, he and his
TOWN PLANNER.
brothers must be the tallest family in
Australia.
John Barr, who died in Sydney last
week, was a Bulletin sub-editor for 11
years and acting-editor for nine months
in 1918 while S. H. Prior was in Britain
with the Australian Press delegation. A
Maorilander, John served his time as a
printer and entered journalism as a ship-
ping reporter for the Wellington (N.ZJ
“Evening Post,” later becoming a special
writer and Parliamentary reporter for the
“New Zealand Times.” In 1906 the old
Sydney “Daily Telegraph” brought him
to Australia and he remained with that
paper for three years until James Edmond
offered him a job on The Bulletin. As
a Bulletin man he did sterling work,
especially during the World War I years.
After leaving the paper, John edited the
magazine pages for the Sydney “Sunday
Times,” was on the staff of “Aussie” and
took up freelance journalism. He was
Sydney representative of the Central
News Agency, London ; the first journalist
in charge of news dispatch from Sydney
to ships at sea ; one of fhe earliest writers
of an Australian film script —“Australia
Calls,” written in collaboration with C. A.
Jeffries, dealt with the invasion of Aus-
tralia by Asiatics and was screened in
1913 ; and a founder of the A.J.A. and
Sydney Press Clubs. John produced two
books — The Story of W. C. Wentworth,
with Lewis Deer and Men and Othet
Sins , a miscellany of poems, short
sketches and epigrams.

Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
In a sparkling little speech Col. A. M.
Sage, Matron-in-Ghief of the A.A.N.S.,
entertained the many guests assembled to
do her honor at a tea-party held at the
Returned Nurses’ Club. She told humor-
ously how, while with the Victory Con-
tingent in London, her Victory March
Jay began at 8 a.m. and ended next morn-
ing (at 2.30 a.m.) at St. Thomas’s Hos-
pital, where she and her colleagues were
given a party in a bathroom from which
they had a wonderful view of the fire-
works display. Col. Sage, who said she
would never forget the kindness of the
London bobbies, many of whom recalled
being in her hospital in the Middle East,
afterwards toured Austria, where she
went through many hospitals. There she
found medical and nursing staffs work-
ing under pitiful conditions, nurses
mostly working barefooted because of the
scarcity of shoes, and all terribly under-
fed. Col. Sage suggested that nurses
here might send spare uniforms and other
articles of clothing to these nurses.
Lydia Shaw, former Principal Matron
in Victoria for the A.A.N.S. and now
Matron of the Alfred Hospital, Miss M.
R. Lang, Principal Matron of the
R.A.A.F. Nursing Service, and many
other former members of the A.A.N.Sb
were at the party, which was arranged
by Helen Ellison.
Melbourne’s Younger Set was well in
evidence at the “Californian Punch
Party” given by the directors of George’s
to mark the opening of a department
which will cater specially for their needs.
Party was also highlighted by a fashion
show of play clothes, swimsuits and sun-
dresses. Walls of palest-pink, white
Venetian blinds and star-shaped electric
lights form part of the decor; poinsettia
and orange-trees bloom in colorful tubs.
Director John George received the guests
with Stella Forster, who will manage the
department. Most of the fashions came
from Cole, of California. Viewing the
show was Mrs. Ralph Michaelis,
who donned an outsize in black straw
sailor hats trimmed with one large pink
rose and which was worn with a black
suit. Anne McDermott’s hat, a sym-
phony in pastel-blue and pink feathers,
was also worn with a black ensemble.
With Tom Gill, who was responsible for
much of the decor, was his wife, Pat,
quite excited at the thought of flying
to Perth in the Skymaster for a short
holiday.
An exhibition of paintings by various
artists was held at the Blue Door to aid
the Food-for-Britain appeal. In opening
the exhibition W. A. Dargie pithily re-
marked “A pleasure to look at in a world
where so many things are unpleasant.”
Peg Williams, director of the Blue Door,
dispensed hospitality and expressed the
sentiments of all those present when she
said how sorry she was that Dora Wil-
son, “most beloved woman artist,” was
ill and unable to attend. Mrs. Hamilton
Sleigh, wearing one of the new towering
hats, was present with her two schoolboy
sons; Mrs. Ina Grover was in the
gathering with schoolgirl daughter, Julie.
Artists Charles Bush and Phyl Water-
house were also seen sipping tea.
Guest of honor at an aftemoon-tea
party at the Oriental given by M. and
Madame Dominic Modesti was soprano
Rita Miller. Madame Modesti, who was
Norma Gadsden, and Rita were fellow
students in Paris, and the party was
given to wish Rita luck in her recital,
which will be at the Assembly Hall to-
morrow night. Rita, who was educated
at the Loretto Convent, Ballarat, studied
in Paris under Madame Dinh Gilly. At
the American Cathedral there she sang
Bach’s “St. Matthew’s Passion” with
Marjorie Lawrence and John Brownlee,
who were amazed to find that she could
sing this long work from memory.
Mutual French friends present at the
party included M. Loubere, Vice Consul
for France, and Madame Besman, thrilled
at the prospect of leaving soon for Paris,
when she will accompany her husband
on a business trip. Also present were
Carl Bartling, pianist, and Richard Chugg,
flautist. They will be associate artists
with Rita.
The seventh of the 1946 Celebrity
Concerts was a veritable feast for music-
lovers, for, in conjunction with the Mel-
bourne Syftiphony Orchestra, under
Bernard Heinze, Raymond Lambert was
pianist in the “Symphony on a Mountain
Theme” by D’lndy. Adding also to the
musical feast was Joan Hammond, who
was heard in two songs from “The
Marriage of Figaro.” For this concert
Joan chose a striking gown of deep
fuchsia lace, worn over an underskirt of
tea-rose pink taffetas and with the same
shade forming the sash ofi her gown.
Dressing of the audience ran mostly to
the formal, though little feather caps and
hats struck notes of fickle fancy. Valerie
Purves, whose wedding has been fixed
for October 22, donned a gay red tailored
coat and dispensed with a hat. Seen
chatting in the foyer was Judge Book,
and with the J. D. Medleys was the
Bishop of Geelong, Rt. Rev. D. McKie.
Maureen Dunckley, pictured here, is
a member of the special ball committee
which is working hard for the success
of the St. Michael’s Debutante Cabaret
Ball to be held in the St. Kilda Town
Hall next Wednesday, October 2.
Maureen, who is an old St. Michael’s
girl, went on to Sydney University, where
she graduated B.A. with honors in Eng-
lish. She was also a winner of a Carnegie
Trust Scholarship, and came back to
Melbourne, where she did a librarian
course at the Public Library. Now she is
with the Australian National Airways as
librarian.
Women racegoers at Moonee Valley
supplied the warmth and color that made
the cold, squally day endurable. More
and more color is creeping into ensembles,
and when a basic tone is worn blouses,
hats and other accessories are gay and
colorful. Startling indeed were the three-
quarter coat and straw hat, in bright
orange tone allied with black, worn by
one racegoer. Muriel Drakeford’s grey
musk-rat coat was worn over a crimson
wool frock. Mrs. Drakeford was smartly
tailored in black and wore silver foxes.
Kathleen Grant Hay was suited in deep
mauve wool, her matching hat being
banded in blue. Shirley Watts’s grey-
tailored suit was worn with a grey felt
hat fashioned on sou’-wester lines. Helen
Lane’s suit in a deep mustard shade had
black accessories. Mrs. C. Curtain’s black
topper was worn with a black suit.
Country visitors included Mrs. Ken Luke,
smartly tailored in grey; Mary Ward,
whose black jacket worn over her black
and white check skirt was topped with a
small black hat; Mrs. King Clarke, of
Tasmania, in a green ensemble.
Hephzibah Menuhin, small, fair-haired
and attractive, wore a delightful frock of
white broderie Anglaise, the bodice tight-
fitting, short-sleeved and laced up the
front with black velvet ribbon, when
she appeared at the Town Hall with the
Queensland State String Quartet. The
programme included works by Brahms,
Cesar Franck and Dvorak. Mrs. Maurice
Nicholas was a concertgoer who favored
the new grey evening gown ; hers was
worn under a mink coat. Mrs. Massey
Burnside wore a scarlet evening gown
under a white lambswool coat. Back
from Sydney, where she had appeared
with the Symphony Orchestra, was Vera
Bradford. With Prof. Bernard Heinze,
who will leave soon for a tour of Canada,
was his wife. Lady Mayoress Valerie
Heinze.
Tessa Smalpage, a Westralian by birth,
is a descendant of the Henty family which
settled in Portland in 1834. Tessa is a
soprano, and in the Assembly Hall re-
cently she gave a recital prior to her de-
parture for Europe, where she hopes to
further her career. Tessa studied with
Madame Dinh Gilly, but with the 'Ger-
mans converging on Paris she decided
it was time to make her way home. For
her recital the young singer was frocked
in a bouffant gown of black net, the
bodice composed entirely of midnight-
blue sequins and with sequins scattered all
over the full skirt. A hair posy repeated
the colorful sequin touch. In the large
audience were Mrs. A. Silk, accompanied
by husband and daughters Joan and
Judith, Mrs. Norman Bennett and Mrs.
A. Crofts.
From Sydney
Last Wednesday everybody went to the
Chelsea Flower Show. The Duke and
Duchess were there, her frock the shade
of purple-blue delphinium. Inside the
gates they were met by a guard-of-honor
of V.A.Ds., their bright blue uniforms
thrown into vividness by green grass and
tree. Mrs. Jessie Street was there, and the
Henry Braddon lady and the Jordan
lady, who opened the show at half-past
three, after the Royalties had paid their
visit and gone bowling off to the garden
party at Scots College. Barbara Knox
and Mrs. Dennis Allen, and tall Hera
Roberts with a small hat of water-lily
pink on the top of her black hair and Mrs.
Roy Buckland and Mrs. Ben Edye were
others who visited or took active part.
Mrs. George Duncan walked about in
smart grey tailorings and a Panama hat of
sporting instincts. Mrs, Joe Coen, tall
lilies in her arms, walked across a lawn
set with bright yellow and blue and red
tubs in which grew cypress pines or efful-
gent azaleas.
Mrs. Persia Porter, in her V.A.D. com-
mandant’s uniform, was seen walking
past a massed effect of Iceland poppies.
Admiral Moore and his wife were
among the thousands walking the
grassy ways. The Erik Langkers
were in the marquee given over
to the R.A.S. display of flower paint-
ings. Incidentally, the Duke was quite
complimentary over the idea of setting
this art display amid the flower show.
The Duchess lingered before a painting
of sunflowers.
This open-air flower show, set in the
outer Domain, was a triumph for or-
ganiser Mrs. Arthur Davis, There were
gardens within gardens. There were
fountains, and even one snow lantern.
Outside one arbor flowery and ferny two
kookaburras perched. There was a model
village arranged by authoress Gladys
Lister. There was a tent where artists
had got busy on decorative effects. Hera
Roberts had done her piece like a picture
in a frame —in it were flowers, even
beetles and a bird’s nest from the
Museum. Loudon Sainthill got a carnival
effect from a salmon-pink background on
which a horse caracolled. The “after
Watteau” niche was complete with Lute
and a garlanded Cupid. Barbara Knox’s
arrangement was in the “Contemporary”
manner. Flowers of Shakspeare made a
corner of charm. Mrs. Ernest Watt had
added her artist touch. There were glori-
ous orchids, and shy bushland flowers
flown from Westralia,
Gifted Sydney pianist Gloria Noud,
pictured here by Rob Hillier, will give a
recital in the Albert Hall, Brisbane, on
Friday night at 8.15.
When some of the women guests at
the Scots College garden party saw the
posy intended for the Duchess, they were
afraid its yellow iris and bright del-
phinium might jar with H.R.H.’s frock.
But the flowers toned in perfectly with
her blue mauve frocking. The Duke and
she went on to Scots from the Chelsea.
There was a guard-of-honor of the
school cadets from the gates to the school
itself. About the grounds were festive-
looking marquees. Headmaster A. K.
Anderson and his wife, and Mr. Geikie,
chairman of the Council, received the
Royal ,guests, and there was tea in
Aspinall House for those active in the
school’s welfare. After tea there were
presentations to the Duke and Duchess.
Other star events of the afternoon, which
began Scots’ Jubilee Year celebrations,
were the inspection of the Cadet Corps,
the presentation of oars to the Head of
the River eight by the Duke, and the
planting of two trees by their Royal
Highnesses.
Fashion is the same in every language.
There was no need to take grammar or
dictionary to the display of French clothes
that has kept the women (yes, and men)
surging to David Jones’s for over a week.
The parade, which closes on
opened on what the Girl in the Flat
Opposite calls a bright galah note. Glar-
ing lights, their power that of millions of
candles, cut the night with a blinding
white swathe outside the Elizabeth-street
doors. And again inside the dining hall
the battery of lights was turned on the
dais that circled the middle of the room,
and around which the French girls, plus
a few Sydney ones, walked displaying
beach clothes, morning, afternoon and
evening frocks.
With an almost Randwick-like rapidity
the French girls took the course. Their
walk was staccato, their hips had rhythm,
their arms almost a soldierly swing. There
was no “see what a pretty girl am I”
pose about them. If they were in beach
togs they looked as though they had a
tryst with the farthest breaker and were
in a hurry to keep it. Their morning
clothes strode out with an air of eager-
ness, and even in the sweep and swathe
and drape of evening frocks there was no
suggestion of languor. Well, after all
those slim, elegant creatures did display
108 different outfits in about two, hours’
time. Each of them, too, must have
walked over a mile in the course of the
evening.
The National Anthem was played, and
the Marseillaise. France’s Minister
Pierre Auge declared the parade open,
speaking first in French, then in English.
Great tubs of white azaleas bloomed in
the intense glare. Through the windows
Hyde Park, cool and remote, was pricked
by pinpoints of light. There was enough
silver fox thrown over the shoulders
of the onlookers to carpet the
room, and here and there sporadic out-
crops of jewels. Hats, very fashionable
and cocktailish, towered above many
tables. There was at least one mantilla.
It was full regalia night for the Grand
Order of Womanhood. Premier McKell
and daughter Betty were there. France’s
Consul-General de la Croix and his wife
were in a group with the Charles Lloyd
Jones couple and the Frederick Jordan
lady. At a ringside table sat Mrs. John
Woods and Mrs. R. Fagan.
Lois Green and Bebe de Roland were
the girls in the “Follow the Girls” party
at the Australia last Monday. The guests,
mostly press and theatre personalities, were
anxious to learn all the latest news of
their world from the two actresses just
arrived by ’plane from London. Lois
and Bebe are playing leading parts in the
new J.C.W. production “Follow the
Girls.” Producer Freddie Carpenter had
a bright and particular niche for himself
at Monday’s midday welcome.
The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester
not only went to the Legacy Ball but
joined the dancers. The Duchess’s frock
was of black velvet, and her jewelled
shoulder straps were blithe with pink and
blue hyacinths. The Duke and Duchess
received the 27 debs., who were pre-
sented by Mrs. J. L. Colman. Presi-
dent of Legacy D. S. Aarons and Mrs.
Aarons entertained the official party, in
which were the Premier and Mrs. Mc-
Kell, Town Clerk Hendy and Mrs. Hendy,
Admiral Moore, Mrs. Moore and
daughter Barbara. Major-General C.
H. Miller and Mrs. Miller and Miss
Eileen Phipps were in the Royal party.
Night’s takings were for Legacy.
For 67 years, come critic, drought, tax-
gatherer or French swimsuit, the Royal
Art Society has held yearly exhibitions
of its members’ paintings. Last Saturday to
a crowded gallery in the Education De-
partment Minister for Education Heffron
declared this year’s show open. The
Minister’s daughter June was with him,
and was presented with a box of flowers
by Diana, daughter of the R.A.S. presi-
dent, Erik Langker. Before the drop of
the official handkerchief many of the can-
vases were sold, the National Gallery
having really done the big thing and
bought one by Jimmy Jackson at 30
guineas.
Early sales, of course, were the result
of the private view, and the sort of private
private view on Thursday evening when
the Society welcomed friends from six to
nine. Erik Langker’s “Breaking Wave”
on the end wall and the Albert Sherman
flower pieces ran about 50-50 in popu-
larity with women visitors. Nor did
Mollie O’Shea’s flower pieces shed their
sweetness unnoted. Howard Veal and
his wife and Jimmy Jackson were others
being congratulated on their work. Dr.
George Duncan, an admirer of Hanke,
was there with his pretty wife. Mrs. Ben
Edye came with tall Benoni and news of
Stephanie, who sends word of a grand
passage over to England and an
immediate start on her dancing studies.

W. A. Watt, who had sat at the head of the
board table since 1929, died on Sept. 13
at 75, a few weeks after failing health
called him into retirement The co. has
lost an able leader and industry one of
its captains. W. A. Bartlett, who came
from England as g.-m. in 1935, and has
done a lot of good work since, has
stepped into the vacant chair.
There are few important industries to-
day that have not the overflowing order
books that go with a sellers’ market.
There is virtually none that has not suf-
fered from shortage of labor and essential
materials. The majority of cos. / have
been able to build up liquid resources
against the proverbial rainy day, which last
is not yet banished from the economic
scene despite the much-advertised splen-
dors of long-term planning. For rubber
manufacturers the changeover from war
to peace production has proceeded
quickly and smoothly because, except for
adjustment of methods made necessary
by substitution of synthetic for natural
rubber, war-time activities of the industry
did not in general compel any major
alteration in machinery.
During the 1945 term the co.’s direct
sales on defence account exceeded
£2,000,000. Last term the figure dropped
to £560,000. Yet, had shipping been
available, turnover would have reached
record figures, the chairman says. Total
production was greater (han in any pre-
vious year. After allowing something
for taxation, and a generous £140,336 for
depreciation, profit from the co.’s own
trade was £2859 lighter at £300,265.
Subsidiaries sent along £76,031 (up
£9831), and £28,327 (up £5533) was
gathered from investments, mainly Gov-
ernment securities.
The co.’s net return from all
sources was thus £12,505 better at
£404,623. That leaves out of the reckon-
ing £39,133 charged against reserves to
cover the difference between purchase
price and par values of shares in sub-
sidiaries bought during the year, and a
small unexplained addition to reserves
of £373. The £404,623 of profit was
enough to give the prefs. their 10 p.c.
(£93,000) and show 8.2 p.c. on the
£3,765,655 of ord. capital, compared with
7.9, 7.6, 7.8, 7.5, 7.6 and 9.5 p.c. back to
1940. The div. was kept at 5 p.c., but,
says the chairman, “We think that a larger
share of the profits of the co. for the
year 1946-47 may with safety be distri-
buted to shareholders.”
Government control of rubber goods
is almost at an end. Demand for these
goods promises to run ahead of produc-
tion for some time. On the raw materials
side stability of price is an all important
factor for the manufacturer. In this re-
spect synthetic rubber promises to pre-
vent emergence of an overgenerous price
for the natural article. In the next few
months the co. expects to revert almost
entirely to the use of plantation crude,
supplies of which are now sufficient to
meet Australian requirements. Selling
prices are still fixed; much therefore de-
pends upon what happens in connection
with costs, mainly wages, hours and the
price of materials, including coal.
Immediate outlook for the subsidiaries
is bright. Latex Products Pty. will soon
be on the market again with “Dunlopillo,”
manufacture of which ceased in 1941.
Dunlops Waterproofs Aus. Pty., formed
in 1944 to manufacture weatherproof
clothing, has been “singularly successful.”
Bentley Bros., which makes gut for tennis
racquets and in which the co. has a con-
trolling interest, “promises to give a good
account of itself.” Bamet Glass Rubber
Co., which sold its Footscray mills to
Bradford Cotton in 1939, recently in-
creased its holding in the cotton co. to
177,031 shares, approx. 13 p.c. of Brad-
ford’s capital. Battery Manufacturers
Pty., recently formed to make Dunlop wet
storage batteries, is now operating in
N.S.W., and will soon set up in Victoria.
Semtex Aus. Pty, is being formed to
trade as flooring contractors, a field as
yet largely untouched. And plans are in
hand to build a tennis racquet factory
in N.S.W.

This co. and the Queensland are the two
principal breweries in the northern State.
During the half-dozen years to the close
of accounts in 1940, C.P.’s paid capital
advanced from £625,000 to £1,500,000 by
par issues, and the board went outside
for an extra £152,699 as well. This new
money, and more besides, went mainly
into hotel properties (up £1,011,688) and
plant (up £147,049), thus widening and
anchoring turnover, which was further
assisted during the war years by service
demands from our own and Allied forces
in the s.-w. Pacific area.
The rapid evaporation of service de-
mands last term was largely offset by a
steady return of civilian population,
following demobilisation. Beer rationing
ceased in March, but the breweries have
been unable to fully meet local demand
owing to shortage of raw materials
(barley and hops). So they have con-
tinued to adhere to the official quota until
output can be stepped up, which looks
like a possibility by the time the thirsty
summer months arrive. Last term’s
£140,928 of profit was written after allow-
ing £30,000 less than in the previous years
for taxation (£135,000 £15,000 more
than was handed to shareholders) and
setting aside whatever was considered
necessary for other contingencies. It was
9.4 p.c. on capital, compared with 9.4,
9.5, 9.3, 7.5, 9.2, 9.4 and 11.2 p.c. back
to 1939. The div. was kept at 8 p.c., and
it is doubtful whether anything better
need be expected, for a while at any rate.
Though drought is severe in the north-
ern State, there is still plenty of money
about, primary products are fetching good
prices, and employment is at a high level,
when not interrupted by senseless strikes.
The Government now grabs the biggest
whack of takings, excise (4s. 7d. a gallon)
accounting for about 73 p.c. of brewers’
gross receipts for bulk beer. The remain-
ing 27 p.c., approximately ss. sd. in the
£, has to cover production, distribution
and other costs, including co. tax, as well
as profit. There is no sign of any near
recession in the cost of labor, barley,
hops, brewing sugar, power or transport
and distribution, and competitive ad-
vertising can be expected to increase.
When manpower and materials become
available deferred repairs and renovation
of hotel properties will call for substan-
tial outlay. The next table shows what
the board has done to meet this con-
tingency :

This recent addition to Australia’s in-
fant cotton-textile industry has given a
very good account of itself. It was set
on its feet with a capital of £67,000-odd
by chairman and managing-director R.
H. Treacy, who used to be a director of
Bradford Cotton Mills. Production be-
gan at an opportune moment —just before
war broke out in 1939. A strong and
growing Government demand on defence
account taxed plant to capacity almost
from the start, and overseas competition,
which had come mainly from Britain and
Japan, was shut off. As the looms got
into their stride earnings responded, and
more capital was gathered, lifting the
figure to £Bl,OOO in 1942 ; it has remained
steady since. Shareholders got into the
picture with 8 p.c. in the second year,
followed by 9 p.c. and then 10 p.c. for
each of the four years to the close of
last accounts. And they can now see the
whole of their capital intact and £7680
besides.
The factory, of modern lay-out, is
equipped with automatic looms, and that
ought to mean much so far as costs and
competition are concerned. The looms
can turn off cotton canvas', ducks, drills,
jeans, gaberdines and twills, as well as
cotton furnishings, which were recently
added to the list of manufactures. Plant
is now working well below capacity, not
because of any shortage of orders, but
owing to scarcity of cotton yarn. The
Government buys the raw cotton, sells it
to spinners, who turn it into yarn which
is sold to weavers for manufacture into
fabrics. Buying and selling prices are
controlled all along the line.
Last term’s £10,182 (up £241) of profit
was 12.5 p.c. on capital, compared with
12.3, 12.5, 12.9, 11.6 and 11.4 p.c. back
to 1941. War has given the co. and the
industry a good start, and provided fresh
opportunities, which cannot be fully ex-
ploited until the supply of yarn catches
up with demand. Much will also depend
upon what happens in connection with
wages and hours, which means costs. The
Australian market for cotton goods has
been starved for the last half-dozen years,
and it will be some time before it can
be satisfied in full. It is speed in satis-
fying demand that creates goodwill, and
goodwill helps to hold the market for a
product in the future. Once the immedi-
ate post-war hunger is satisfied, price,
design and quality rather than ability to
supply will become the determining fac-
tors. By its heavy-footed approach to
these problems, the Government created
more problems than it set out to solve.
There is nothing to worry about in the
co.’s finances:

When disorder of kidney function
permits poisonous matter to remain
in your blood, it may cause nagging
backache, rheumatic pains, leg pains,
loss of pep and energy, disturbed
nights, swelling, puifiness under the
eyes, headaches ond dizziness. Fre-
quent or poor kidney action some-
times show there is something wrong
with your kidneys or bladder.
Don't delay. Ask your chemist or

A committee appointed by the State
Government to report on the Briseis mine,
at Derby (Tas.), has rejected as unsound
a proposal that the Government should
take over and work the property. It says
nothing logical can be recommended re-
garding future working of the mine. A
year ago the general manager ot the
co. reported that “it is our belief that
1948 will end operations, as all indica-
tions are that the grade will then be too
low to enable any profit to be made at
any likely price of tin.” The method ot
mining is by sluicing, in which hydraulic
elevators and gravel pumps are used. The
deposit possesses unusual features ; it con-
sisted of a body of stanniferous drift over
400 ft. wide and 250 ft. deep, covered to.a
large extent by basalt up to 150 ft. thick.
A further complicating factor was that
the Ringarooma River, subject to severe
floods in the winter, flowed alongside and
across the deposit, the bed of the river
being about 150 ft. above the bottom of
the drift. The Briseis Tin and General
Mining Co., a London concern with a
capital of £600,000, successfully worked
the show from 1899 to 1929, when a flood
burst a dam and destroyed the mine plant
and workings. In 1931 a Launceston syn-
dicate formed the New Briseis I in Mines,
which took over and worked the show on
a small scale by tribute. Then Burma
Malay became interested, and formed the
present co., Briseis Consolidated, with a
capital of £150,000. In 1936 ttys works
were again flooded ; salvage and recondi-
tioning occupied nine months and cost
over £25,000. Tin recoveries had fallen
from 2.031 b. per c.y. in 1940 to 0.661 b. per
c.y. in 1945, and costs kept on climbing.
At cud there were 111 men era-
ployed.

“Iona”: The eastern half of Victoria
still holds opportunities for prospectors,
though there are only a handful of mines
working profitably there now. The moun-
tainous regions are generally goldbearing
to some extent, and the country is highly-
metamorphised. The reefs are small but
numerous and some are very rich, values
occur frequently though irregularly and
the terrain is rough. Small parties, in-
cluding at least one experienced hand,
would have the best chances. The Maude
and Yellow Girl, at Glen Wills, is down
1300 ft and still doing well; and the
inverted saddle reefs at Harrietville were
worked to fair depths. Several promising
belts were not developed to the extent
they deserved. Others, too numerous to
mention, left off at comparatively shallow
depths, mostly on account of small ton-
nage. Still, many of the latter yielded
rich returns near the surface.

were taken by the Government. Mining
and milling costs were then abound 545.
a ton. The co. has paid divs. totalling
ss. 6d. a share. To end 1945 cost of
maintenance, etc., was met mainly from
a Commonwealth grant for the purpose.
A 410 kw. alternator has been ordered
to replace the one requisitioned. Recon-
ditioning and re-equipment are expected
to cost about £lOO,OOO, of which the
Federal Government will provide £70,000,
at 4| p.c. p.a., repayable on the basis of
30s. per fine ounce of gold produced. No
divs. or directors’ fees are to be paid
during the currency of the loan. A
further £26,560 has been obtained from
Gold Exploration and Finance on a
second debenture, also at 4 \ p.c. p.a., re-
payable out of profits remaining after
payment to the Government. The Ex-
ploration co. has also been given an
option over 240,000 Triton shares at 2s.
each. Hence the board’s request to share-
holders for authority to subdivide 48,000
of the unissued 10s. shares into 2s. units.
Ore reserves remain static at 226,000 tons,
averaging 6.4dwt. Hopes centre mainly
in ore developing again in the downward
continuation of the Emu North structure,
and in the possibility of the shoot open-
ing up on No. 8 level in Emu South
structure. On the Eaglehawk option 53ft.
of 12.5dwt. ore, width 51 inches, has been
opened up at 130 ft. During the ye?r
one lease was purchased, and two ad-
joining the co.’s property to the north
were pegged. The co. has £27,402 in cash
and Government bonds; stores figure at
£19,667. There was £4449 coming to out-
siders. Buyers offer 4s. sd. for the scrip.

Consolidated at £13,581 for year ended
March last, as against £14,420 for the year
before. Div. and bonus of Is. 3d. a share,
less U.K. income tax, takes £8594, and
£5OOO is added to div. equalisation
reserve. Cash and bonds in hand con-
tinue to represent a substantial portion
of market valuation of shares. Ore re-
serves, which are well ahead of the mill,
show little alteration in either tonnage
or grade. Plans for deeper development
and more active prospecting in new
ground, both in the South Kalgurli
and Hainault blocks, are in hand.
Some think that a merger with
North Kalgurli, which adjoins the
South on two sides, followed by a part
return of capital, wouldn’t be a bad idea.
Both cos. are under joint local manage-
ment, and it is argued an amalgamation
would cut costs all round.

Paringa Mining and Exploration, Ltd.,
which already has (1) a producing group
of mines at the north end of the Kal-
goorlie Golden Mile, (2) another group
awaiting development known as Man-
tana, two miles further north, and
(3) a substantial interest in the adjoining
Mt. Charlotte group, has now secured
temporary reservation over some
hundreds of acres of auriferous country
at the old alluvial and reefing centre of
Bulong, 20 miles east of The Mile,
This reservation is said to include the
waterlogged Queen Margaret, one of the
best Westralian gold producers in the
early days. Values petered out at com-
paratively shallow depth, and the operat-
ing co. —an Adelaide no-liability con-
cern —gave up.
* * * *
Westralian goldmining cos. want more
labor and they are willkig to pay new-
comers full award rates while they learn
their jobs. Some of the best under-
ground men on the Kalgoorlie Golden
Mile were formerly cuff-and-collar
workers. The number now employed in
the industry falls far short of the pre-
war total, but, with several war-time shut-
down mines coming into production
again, and with new mines opening up,
the pre-war aggregate could be exceeded
if sufficient labor were obtainable.

Some well-known names are repre-
sented in the Royal Art Society’s exhibi-
tion, and paintings stretch along the walls
of two long rooms on the 6th floor of
the Sydney Education Department build-
ing. But of all the entries Lance
Solomon’s “Smoke Haze” and “Aus-
tralian Coast” are the most impressive.
Although Solomon’s paintings are not
large (Streeton’s, panoramic view of the
Prospect Reservoir is 18ft. x for
instance), there is a spaciousness about
them which belongs to the grand school
of Australian landscape painting. In part,
Solomon achieves this by a gradual un-
rolling of a picture. It is possible to spend
a long time standing in front of a
Solomon painting, and still find much to
admire. “Australian Coast” is therefore
doubly interesting: as an example of the
artist’s versatility—he is chiefly known as
a painter of the bush; and as a
specimen of this slow revelation of un-
expected beauties.
Looking at the picture for the first time
one has an immediate and vivid impres-
sion of blue and green. Blue sea in the
distance, green water near the coast: the
coast itself rocky and wooded, with slim,
warmly-colored trees. But the green and
blue hold the eye. There is a swiftness,
an impact, about the painting which re-
sembles a vigorous impressionistic water-
color, rather than an oil. And the color-
ing is of the kind which readily deterior-
ates into crude splashes, or mere pretti-
ness, in unskilled hands. Not here
though: the blend is right. It is, in fact,
a fine spirited picture of blue and green
sea-water. But a second glance, or a
third, reveals a white wave near the coast
with backward curving wings, and follow-
ing its taut line other curved waves,
green and successive, are discovered.
The unexpectedness of it all is a delight,
and, taken all round, it is as fine a piece
of observation of a mood of the sea as
might be found. Then the white wave, on
closer inspection, proves to be alive, leap-
ing and boiling against the troubled green
shallows. Almost, it hisses.
But it is as a painter of the Australian
bush that Solomon will be judged, and
here he has something important to say.
Developing from the tradition of Streeton
and Gruner and Heysen, he has a con-
tribution of his own to make. Streeton
once, in discussing his art, referred to
“the sense of space seen from a hilltop.”
And about the best of the Australian*
landscapes there is an impression of look-
ing down ; and, sometimes, of looking up.
But Solomon’s bush scenes differ in genus,
if not in species. He gets within the
bush. More, he paints odd corners of it,
as though he had stumbled upon them
by accident. And in a slow unspec-
tacular way new facets of beauty show
themselves.
“Smoke Haze” may be taken as a
model of this kind of work. Slim trees
are shadowy with smoke, low-toned, and
most of the color of the painting comes
from the earth, patchy and red and
shiny, as though wet. There is a cold-
ness about the painting which is not usual
in Solomon’s pictures, and the strength
of it lies in angles of light piercing the
trees and in restraint. Like similar works,
“Smoke Haze” is built up, as it were, on
a triangle. But whereas the usual land-
scape resembles a triangle viewed from
one side or another —rivers, trees, hills,
building up to a careful apex —Solomon’s
triangle has the sharp end pointing into
the picture ; and the effect is as though
one were looking along sharp lines of
. light. In this case the triangle scheme is
assisted by a fence, thin battens and the
wires silvery, shining and disappearing
into the haze.
Genius is a big word, and one which
loses its value when overworked. But
some stronger term than “good” or “ex-
cellent” is necessary for a painter who
can produce two outstanding and sharply
different works in one exhibition. And,
if genius is not a state of perfection, but
a kind of vital and growing essence,
there seem good grounds for applying it
to Lance Solomon. For his work has
flaws of the kind that indicate his capacity
is still developing. In more than one
painting, for instance, he uses white in an
extraordinary and confident manner.
Sometimes, as in the sea-piece, it suc-
ceeds. But in his method of applying it
there are no half-measures. It succeeds
or it doesn’t. A patch of white in “Smoke
Haze,” meant, possibly, for ash, has the
odd though fleeting effect of being acci-
dental.

In John Goodchild’s exhibition (at
David Jones’ Gallery, Sydney), the best
work is with the pencil. “Hill’s Dwell-
ing,” which was bought by the N. S.
Wales National Art Gallery, creates an
image better than most drawings; it
shows delicacy of touch and sense of
form, and a skilful exploitation of blank
spaces. The faults in Goodchild’s work
are stiffness and blankness, such as skies
of an uncompromising uniform blue and
solid-looking shadows. “Clovelly,” a
watercolor bought by the N. S. Wales
Gallery, is chiefly remarkable on that
score.
"Soldier's Wife."
Rose Franken’s “Soldier’s Wife”
(Minerva) is essentially the same char-
acter as her “Claudia” —a dear, dumb,
dithering creature with the disarming
charm of a child and as exasperating as
a lost collar stud. Like Claudia, she is
apparently watched over by the same
Providence that takes care of inebriates
and mends her mistakes as blindly and
completely as she makes them.
The first act of the play is dull for two
reasons: (1) Because Miss Franken dis-
courses, through her characters, on the
problem of the returned soldier in the
airy, theoretical manner of pseudo-psy-
chologists and authors of magazine
articles —her discourse immobilises her
story and characters and compels her
soldier to speak, act and think as no re-
turned soldier ever did. (2) Because, since
soldiers first started returning, their
alleged problem has been created and
done to death much too often by play-
wrights, novelists and other well-meaning
or commercially-minded individuals who
can’t or won’t realise that the main needs
of the returned man are a job and a home
and a few months to adjust himself to
the change of scenery—which he’ll do
as capably as he adjusted himself to
service life.
Having unburdened herself of her
views on returned soldiers. Miss Franken
settles down to what she does very well
—light, domestic comedy which, in this
case, froths around a wife whose letters
to her husband overseas are published in
what becomes a “best-selling” book. The
ingenuous and slightly addled doings of
the wife are neatly set off against two
brittle sophisticates—a newspaper editress
and a feature writer who descend upon
her like vultures and, of course, remain
to pray—and punctuated by mildly
humorous misunderstandings and re-
marks about bargain shopping, babies,
diapers, corned beef and cabbage and
other blessings of matrimony.
Terry Walker is as effective and ener-
getic as she was in “Claudia,” and gets
excellent and generous support from Pat
McDonald, as her somewhat saner sister;
Eric Reiman, her husband ; and Diana
Perryman and John Bushelle as the
Press.

Once again Joan Hammond made few
concessions to popular taste in her recital
at Sydney Town Hall on Saturday night.
Most of her songs were severely classical,
many of them previously unheard here,
and some of them of no great merit, if
melody be the yardstick. But all of them
were beautifully sung, including some
splendid lieder of Richard Strauss.

“Stars and Garters,” the current Tivoli
show, has all the usual trimmings and
the usual fine presentation. For those
who like infant prodigies there is a very
youthful Annette Klooger, singing in a
very adult manner, and for the seemingly
inexhaustible queue of Tiv. addicts there
are tap-dancing, an adagio act, some ex-
traordinary bodily manipulation in the
form of acrobatics, and the military pre-
cision and unmilitary content of the
Tiv.’s ballet.
At the Talkies.
What an admirable actor is Claude
Rains! His role in “Mr. Skeffington”
(Century) is that of a European Jew who
builds a new life and a fortune in
America only to have both wrecked by a
man-mad female who marries him to stop
him prosecuting her brother. Not an un-
common film character, but Rains plays
it magnificently from the drop of an eye-
lid to his final outburst against the
woman. Bette Davis, as the woman, has
an overdrawn role, and makes no
attempt to tone it down, and the final
scenes of a reunion between her and
Rains are the usual concession to senti-
mentality, but Rains’s performance runs
through the film almost like a vein of
pure histrionic art.

Walt Disney’s latest outbreak, “Make
Mine Music” (Mayfair), is almost a com-
plete degeneration to the comic strip —
“The Martins and the Coys,” “Casey at
Bat,” and a couple more chapters of the
opus are simply animated comic strips in
technicolor with music or words to
match. Disney is mildly interesting when
he turns to matching line and color with
sound, as he does here with a kind of
surrealist illustration of the explosive an-
tics of animated and distorted musical in-
struments. He is at his best with fairy
tales, in this case with “Peter and the
Wolf” and “The Whale Who Wanted to
Sing at the Met.,” although the spectacle
of a purple whale with green wings
should bring the strongest protest from
the Whale Lovers’ League, the Friends
of Whales Association, the R.S.P.C.W.,
and whales.

“The Lady Objects” (Capitol): A tech-
nicolor western of such incredibly dread-
ful ingredients that it is doubtful if the
combined histrionic talent of this day and
age could raise it to the depths of
banality.
The treason charge against Major
Cousens had been before Central Police
Court, Sydney, for 15 days when the hear-
ing was adjourned until this week. Since
Mr. Farrington, S.M., ruled that the
Crown had made out a prima facie case
against him, Major Cousens had been in
the box for eight days —four days
giving evidence-in-chief, and four
days under cross-examination. He was
closely questioned by Mr. Dovey, K.C.,
on the score of relations with Japanese
in Tokyo, and in Sydney before the war;
of gifts and letters to the Crown witness,
Foumy Saisho, and of a proposal to the
Japanese that he should be dropped bv
parachute over Australia to find out the
prospects of negotiating a separate peace.
He stated that he had tried to “get closer
to Shigemitsu, the Foreign Affairs
Minister apropos of a peace, and to have
the Emperor’s attention directed to the
Japanese treatment of prisoners-of-war.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM
At Rosehill on Saturday the S.T.C. had a
near-record attendance of 30,000, but con-
ditions were more comfortable than of old.
The tea-house in the paddock has been shifted
back to the boundary fence and the betting
ring spread out. A more startling alteration
is the replacing of the old judge’s box with
a huge, circular, concrete tower five or six
storeys high. Situated well back between the
two stands, and connected with the members’
stand by an aerial ramp, this high round-
tower, not quite completed, at present houses
the judge, stewards and magic-eye camera. It
used up a lot of materials which could have
gone info servicemen’s houses —but, then, what
are servicemen for nowadays, except as instru-
ments of enriching well-advertised bookies like
the new press idol, young Mr. Browning?
The only surprising feature of Bernborough’s
13th successive win was his price; with only
three opposing him in the Hill Stakes 4 to 1 on
was remarkably good. Sentimental support
for Flight (9 to 2) was probably the reason*
The mare showed all her expected gameness,
but was very easily beaten, Prince Consort
being third and Chaytor the also-ran. Hard
held over the final furlong, Bernborough clocked
1.451 —just average time for the odd distance
of a mile and 110yds.
Emborough headed the sires’ list for last
season with 36 winners of 931 races and £37,248
in stake money. Bernborough’s contribution
to that was 10 of the races and £19,956 of
the stakes. In fact, Bernborough’s earnings
in one season exceeded by several thousand
pounds the total amount previously won by
progeny of the Gainsborough stallion.
Another of Emborough’s sons, the five-year-
old entire Dowborough, made an impressive
showing in the seven furlongs Theo Marks
Quality Handicap, and forced the Epsom
favorite Shannon to produce probably his best
run to date. Refusing to enter the barrier
stalls, Dowborough started from the extreme
outside, but was in front and leading them
a merry dance before they’d travelled half a
furlong. Making up a little ground round the
turn, Shannon set out in earnest in the run
down the straight, just collaring the Queens-
land sprinter on the post. Good Idea com-
menced to rattle home well, but died in his
run, and failed to head Dowborough out
of second place.
Shannon’s time, 1.224, bettered the course
record by lisec. and is only a half-second
outside Freckles’ Australian record. He looks
like being extremely tough opposition for any-
thing in the Epsom. The most recent dual-
Epsom winner was Chatham, whose weights
were 8.13 and 9.10. Shannon won with 8.10
last year and will be trying to repeat- with 9.9.
Run over nine furlongs at level weights, the
Rosehill Guineas attracted most of the fancied
Derby colts and was won by Prince Standard,
again beating Flying Duke; Two Grand third.
The grey Denali set the pace and led to the
distance, but was swamped thereafter. Flying
Duke is favorite for the Derby, his supporters
having great faith in his “powerful finishing
run.” It might be pointed out that Prince
Standard also has a pretty tidy finish which
on two successive occasions has proved better
than that of Flying Duke. Another who
should not be forgotten as a Derby prospect is
Prince Consort, doing a quietly efficient prepara-
tion by running in Bernborough’s races and,
incidentally, paying his expenses.
Open Air displayed considerably improved
form to win the S.T.C. Handicap. Among the
other Metrop. chances engaged, Silver Link,
Invictus and Craigie, finishing in that order
behind the winner, all made a fair fist of the
12-furlongs journey.
A seven-furlongs Encourage attracted swarms
of entries. Yukon, defeating Hi Silva and
Lady Contrast in the first division, and Happy
Ways, accounting for Tengur and Star Vite
in the second, each led home a well strung-out
field, but the third division provided the best
finish of the day. With less than 50 yards
to go any of eight or nine, spread across the
track, could have won; crossing the line Indarra
and Dark Marne had drawn slightly ahead,
and the judge had to call on the camera,
Indarra receiving the verdict from Dark Marne,
with Heroic Age next. Camera finish was
again signalled after the Welter, and the print
showed Laudus just shading Cisco, with Rouge
D’Or third.

Easily the most outstanding performance at
Moonee Valley on Saturday, and an instructive
example of the pitfalls strewing the way of
those who try to pick ’em, was Attley’s defeat
of Royal Gem and Don Pedro in the mile
Underwood Stakes (w.f.a.). At his previous start
in the Memsie Stakes at Caulfield Attley was
a bad last; in the Underwood he led all the
way, and cantered in by four lengths.
Explanation given for Attley’s improvement
was that his rider in the Memsie had been
instructed to ride him from behind, but wasn’t
told not to make a boy v. horse contest of
it if Attley fought for his head. With another
rider H Badger, substituted, and that impor-
tant qualification added to the instructions,
Attley hit the front right away in the Under-
wood and nothing got near him.^
Attley has 9.3 in the Caulfield Cup, which
means that Bernborough will be conceding the
very good son of Portofino H stone. Witn
Attley and a crowd of other well-performed
candidates opposing Bernborough, this years
Caulfield Cup should be one of the most in-
teresting ever run. On his record Bernborough
could win despite his 10.10, but it will be his
toughest job to date: a strong field opposing
him on a course that is not without its
trickiness.
The Valley’s distance event (13 furlongs) was
won by the Blank gelding Space, with a head
and a half-head to Valour and Neutron;
Invasion Chief downed Burnevoke and St.
Dandy (a probable early winner) in the
sprint; and Stormy Sea added yet another win
to his recent excellent record by beating Praetor,
Tudor Prince and the other three-year-olds in
“Watch ’ im , Tiger -e's a scientific fighter.”
the mile Spring Stakes. Priority won the
Hurdle, and Prince Negri’s defeat of Star
Shell and The Sirdar in the Highweight brought
A. Breasley back into the winning list.

They had a rare meeting up Tamworth
(N.S.W.) way last week. Hostilities opened
with the judge declaring for the hot favorite
in the Flying, many thinking another beast
had won comfortably. The stipe, stood down
the judge, called a committee meeting and
requested a replacement. The committee re-
sponded with expressions of perfect confidence
in the judge, whom the steward, with no
alternative, then reinstated. Bookmakers
settled the issue by declining to do further
business, and on this happy note the meeting
Was abandoned.

From the letter of a schoolteacher, ex-
R.A.A.F. cobber of this page: “Sometimes I
day-dream and see you and me at early Moore-
field or studying the tote at Randwick. Then
I wake up and realise that Australian youth
is waiting to be led along the paths of virtue.
In telling the story of Dick Whittington, though,
I couldn’t resist giving the breeding of Turn
Again.” , _ .

The Australian Rugby Unionists broke
a record by defeating Wellington (first
time since 1892) to make their winning
tally five games —the most since Aus-
tralia has been sending teams across the
Tasman. It was a narrow win (16-15);
the game was played during a violent
thunderstorm, which made the forwards
bear the brunt. Showing a big improve-
ment, the Australian pack held its own
with the tough M.L. forwards, Col
Windon getting over for two fine tries,
but a sprained ankle may put him out of
Saturday’s Test; Scrum-half Cyril Burke
played Test-class football. Earlier in the
week the visitors were downed 8-6 by
Southland.

Collingwood, beaten by Essendon in
the V.F.L. semi-final replay, gets a
second chance at the ‘premiership next
Saturday against Melbourne, the winner
to play Essendon in the “grand” final.
There’s big money in the V.F.L. finishes
this year. The first semi-final, Footscray
v. Melbourne, drew 61,276 for a £6773
gate ; second semi-final, Collingwood v.
Essendon, 77,370 and £8477 ; replay of
’Wood and Dons after the draw, 64,400
and £6670. On Saturday the big crowd
saw poor football, both teams bustling .
and playing the man until the last quarter,
when Essendon opened out and ran all
over the weary Collingwood men;
10.16-8.9.

“Old Mat” recalls close Tests;
At Manchester (Eng.) in July, 1902, when
England went down by three runs, Australia
had a lead of 37 on the first innings (299
to 262), but Lockwood (5 for 28) and Rhodes
(3 for 26) wrecked them for 86 in the second
innings. Left 123 to win, England crashed
for 120 through tigerish bowling by Saunders
(4 for 52) and Trumble (6 for 53). In that
match 31 players failed to get double figures.
Other narrow Test wins have been Australia
by six runs at Sydney in 1885; Australia by
seven runs at The Oval in 1882; England by
10 runs at Sydney in 1894; Australia by 11
runs at Adelaide in 1925; England by 12 runs
at Adelaide in 1929; England by 13 runs at
Sydney in ,1887; and England by one wicket
both at Kennington in 1902 and at Melbourne
in 1908.

After seeing him fight Camera, Jack
Johnson said of Joe Louis, “Anybody
with a good right hand will kill him.”
That was how Schmeling outed the
Bomber; and, armed with the same
weapon, if little else except saloon-brand
avoirdupois, Tami Mauriello went close
to repeating the dose with the first blow
struck in the one-round title fight last
week. The punch rocked Louis, and
made him hang on. Joe then returned
the insult and Tami smote the canvas.
Tami arose to plant another right, but,
after Joe had hit him everywhere with
everything, a left hook lifted the Bronx
barman a foot in the air, and as he came
down he stopped a right with his jaw and
the canvas for the count.
There was big talk of scalping Louis
next after British heavyweight champ.
Bruce Woodcock cleaned up Gus Lesne-
vich, holder of the world’s cruiserweight
title, but it would have said mighty little
for the Yorkshire laad if he hadn’t. As
far back as eight years ago Ron Richards
gave Gus the father of a walloping in
Sydney, and Gus didn’t come forward
for a second helping. Still, Woodcock
looks the part and could prove as good
as Tommy Farr, who went the distance
with Louis. Another Woodcock-Mauriello
encounter looks certain as a lead up to
one with Joe. Last time he and Tami
met, Woodcock was outed in the fifth
round, but he’d had Tami groggy earlier
and failed to go in, a form of British
politeness he discarded to give Lesne-
vich a severe pasting and knock him in
the eighth.

Ken Bailey had too much class for
Jack Toomey in one of two 12-round
contests at Sydney Stadium and got the
referee’s decision. The pair are welter-
weights. In a light-heavyweight contest
Max Cameron outpointed George Allen.
Allen had come from Maoriland with
high ambitions. He was aggressive
enough, but nearly all his punches were
ill-directed.
* * * *
A sterling exhibition of pluck and
skill was given by Jimmy Hogg in a
Leichhardt bout with a Malay, Young
Andre, who looked at least 71b. heavier.
Andre was always aggressive, but most
of his punches hit holes in the circumam-
bient atmosphere, while Hogg seldom
missed with straight lefts. Both were on
their feet at the end of 12 rounds, and
the referee gave it a draw. Andre was
hooted as he left the ring; Hogg was
cheered to his dressing-room.

Labor’s Economic Record
The Canberra Labor Government,
composed of members of a political party
which has for years held cheaply the
benefits brought to this country by
rational and conscientious financial
methods and by individual enterprise,
and which, early in its control of the
Treasury during this war, indulged in
almost an orgy of inflationary bank
credit, is actually conducting a news-
paper-advertising campaign extolling its
own merits as an exponent of sound
financial principles. The big bouquet is
thrown in the direction of Mr. Chifley,
but the imposture would .be almost as
brazen if the flowers were used to gar-
land the head of Eddie Ward or Cheque-
pound Lazzarini.
The party is full of pious economic
platitudes now. But it is on record that
the late John Curtin expressed a
startling esteem for bank credit in peace
or in war, and was rebuked by Claude
Reading, now also gone, for his reckless-
ness. It was during Mr. Chifley’s term
as Prime Minister that the Common-
wealth Bank board was replaced by
Treasury (or Caucus) control.
Whatever the Australian banking
system and civil service have achieved in
the jvay of successful financial running it
may truly be said to have been accom-
plished in spite of, rather than because of,
the Canberra Labor Government. Not
that the results to date have been much
to be satisfied about; but in fighting
inflation politically created there has
been good work done in some respects,
though not nearly such good work as the
statistician’s cost-of-living figures would
suggest.
It was the Menzies and Fadden Gov-
ernments which set up price-control, the
munitions-making directorate, and which
passed the basic National Security Act by
which the manpower, money and
materials of the nation were made avail-
able, where necessary, for the purpose of
an all-in war effort. These Governments
set up a framework capable of bearing
the weight of total war long before Labor
came to office. When Labor stepped in
in October, 1941, it set out on a pro-
gramme of total politics, beginning with
Mr. Curtin’s “without inhibitions” cry to
America before the Japanese war was a
month old. After that the National
Security Act was used, apart from its
rightful purpose, as a means of making
concessions to disruptionists, for attack-
ing their opponents (Australia First cases
a glaring instance) and for socialising
finance and industry. Abolishing of pink
icing, the banishment of Father Christ-
mas and the setting of rigid prices on
Stock Exchange securities were highlights
of Labor strong-arm “war effort.”
The term of Labor’s occupancy of
the Treasury benches has betn notable
for the amount of credit-expansion, costs
inflation, industrial indiscipline, produc-
tion depression, blackmarketing and
similar •hanky-panky seen in the Aus-
tralian economy. Conspicuous also have
been the weakening of the rule of social
law and defiance of economic law. But
economic law at least will not be defied
for a great deal longer. Only the totali-
tarian State, Fascist or Communist, can
attempt to do that. And there is no
future for what we have come to know as
human beings in the totalitarian State.
In Labor’s financial domination of
Australia for the past five years its char-
acteristic weakness for “national credit”
shows up in the amount of bank credit
used to finance war wastage. Its day-
dreams about higher pay for less work
were put into practice in many quarters.
"No, sarge, I didn't ring — y' musta got the Wrong number.”
most glaringly, perhaps, in the example
of the seamen —an eight-hour reduction
in the working week was introduced by
National Security Regulation, sidetrack-
ing the Arbitration Court, and “war”-
risk bonuses continue to be paid on the
Australian coast even to this day.
Merchant seamen on too many occasions
have put on a bad show in spite of all
the out-of-season “concessions” thrust
upon them by Canberra Labor, and in
bank-credit usage and undue “conces-
sions” to Labor there has been a combina-
tion of credit and costs inflation that
strikes at our financial security and pro-
ductivity.
Only 46 p.c. of the “public” loans
raised during Labor’s term of Federal
office was contributed by persons and
firms, the remaining 54 p.c.—about £543
million—being put up by banks, etc.,
particularly savings banks. In addition,
on June 30 last, the Treasury-bill debt
held by the banking system totalled £343
million, apart from bills discounted within
the Government-departmental set-up. Al-
together, nearly two-thirds of all borrow-
ings by Labor (about £l4OO million) dur-
ing the period ended June 30 last were
forced on to the banking system, public
response to Government exhortations for
war funds having been so poor. The
result has been that the people have not
directly contributed, in either taxes or
loans, enough to pay for war wastage,
and that credit has been expanded exces-
sively on no basis of real economic
value. The Government has made little
visible attempt to relieve the position by
economy at any time ; on the contrary,
it has splashed many millions of money
around in reckless political expenditure,
often in staggering contrast to its advice
to the people—“be a saver, not a
spender,” etc.
By contrast with this credit expansion,
which shows up in a feverish, unhealthy
growth in public spending power (but not
buying power) to more than two and a
half times the pre-war figure, there has
been a fall in coal production to below
the pre-war level, and steel output is in
a similar condition. Production of
butter, wheat, meat, textiles, building
materials and many other manufactures
has been equally unsatisfactory ; trans-
port services are inadequate, while home-
building is. far behind a normal pre-war
average.
The preposterous situation which
Labor has been largely instrumental
in creating is one in which not only
is the excessive spending power mis-
leading as to the extent of the com-
munity’s real savings, but also one in
which the level of “employment” is an
utterly false indication of the nation’s
present productive capacity. The Gov-
ernment claims that total employment in
Australia (exclusive of domestics and
farm labor) was 2,037,000 in April this
year, compared with 1,730,000 persons in
1939. Considering the growth in “em-
ployment” the fall in our general level
of production and economic activity is a
shocking disgrace, though one which
Labor never makes any real attempt to
deal with. It tries to avoid facing the
hard facts of government just as, in the
past, sections of it have recommended a
policy of bilking its creditors. “Don’t
work and don’t pay, but grab all you can
for yourself” is too nearly the sectionally-
selfish Labor-party philosophy for any
citizen to feel comfortable in his mind
about a Government that is still spending
about half the national (people’s) income
each year, compared with less than a
tenth of it by pre-war Governments.
Among the Labor Ministers Mr. Ded-
man at least has made it plain that he does
not want Australians to own their own
homes ;he said.his Government was “not
concerned to make the people little capi-
talists” by encouraging or assisting them
to own homes. In its rather erratic
spasms of socialism the Government
plays into the hands of the Communists,
who are out to destroy the Australian
productive, financial and social systems, in
that order. Though hesitating to take a
full plunge into socialism —possibly
shaken by the verdict of the people at
the 1944 referendum —Canberra Labor
has toyed dangerously with the principle,
and in its actions with regard to banking,
air transport, shipping and coal it has
tended to cripple private industry, the
country’s real productive force.
Fuddled in its own mind, but insist-
ing on exercising dictatorial sway over
finance and industry—through central-
bank action, through price-control,
through Budget policy, through Treasury
regulations and through the “black”
weapon of the trade-unions—the Govern-
ment is causing disorganisation through-
out the Australian productive system.
Production is suffering from shocking
political abuse.
The Government controls all inter-
state shipping, either as charterer or
owner. Debit balance in its shipping
branch in 1944-45 was £2,261,000, in
1945- £3,739,000.
The productively-minded don’t know
where they stand, and neither do the
thrifty. The multitude who voted Labor
into office at the last election are afraid
to subscribe so enthusiastically to its war
and “security” loans. The Australian
record of support to war loans was the
worst in the Allied world.
The unreal picture of “full employ-
ment” and inflated spending power
created by Labor still dazzles many
people who cannot see the trickery. The
deception is added to by highly-colored
(and exceptionally costly) schemes of
“social security.” Canberra Labor has
been assisted in its deception by the fun-
damental public reaction to war. People
were prepared to put up with the cost
and hardships of war, including the
changeover to munitions instead of civilian
production, because of the necessity for
an all-in war effort. This war effort
'treated an accumulation of two things,
namely, consumer credit and consumer
demand. No conscientious Government
could feel pleased merely with a situa-
tion in which these two factors had be-
come an embarrassment. “Full employ-
ment” becomes an embarrassment when
consumer demand is so great that Labor,
with work offering on all sides, decides
to take the consumer by the throat.
And an inflation of consumer credit is
a positive national danger when it
threatens the whole productive equili-
brium.
Mr. Chifley and his confreres claim
that they have prevented wages-inflation
by wage-pegging. They have prevented it
no more than they have stopped cost-of-
living inflation. Although the basic wage
is claimed to have been prevented from
rising more than 22\ p.c. since war be-
gan, actual factory wages in the year to
June 30, 1945, were 38 p.c. higher for
men, 41 p.c. higher for women. These
wages were paid in a period in which
workers were manufacturing compara-
tively little upon which to spend their
wages.
The Government shows little sign of
attempting to balance the Federal Budget.
It is still spending excessively, still pro-
viding costly but dubious social services,
still borrowing and taxing excessively.
Instead of using funds recovered from
previous expenditure to reduce the
national debt it uses them to offset the
magnitude of its present extravagance. Its
published accounts are full of tricks and
deceptions, and it is quite obvious that,
in its heart, the Government itself is
afraid to let the people know the truth
of its economic difficulties. Hence the
brazen bluff in newspaper advts. about
its “sound financial policy,” Significantly,
no Budget has been presented for
1946- nor will one be presented until
after the elections. The Government is
afraid to let its future policy—if there is
to be one —be known.
The Government talks about the in-
flation danger, but it continues with its
inflationary spending, relying on price-
controls which, however well adminis-
tered, undoubtedly slow up production
while only deferring inflation’s effects. It
expects colossal things from private enter-
prise in the way of production—for which
there is a desperate need —but it deals
snakily and harshly with those constitu-
ting private enterprise. It has made one
huge mistake after another, such as the
treatment of the Dutch, but it then pro-
ceeds just as pigheadedly to make a
further blunder. Above all, it has not
the moral backbone or vision to deal with
the forces which so blatantly make it
their business to strike at Australian social
and living standards at every opportunity.


Why I Bank at the “Wales”
d
m
When a man reaches my time of life, he is glad
to withdraw from the hurly burly of everyday
business.
So one reason why I bank ai the "Wales" is
because most of my banking can be done auto-
matically, with no effort on my part. My pension,
dividends and bond interest are credited to my
account and I make my payments to tradespeople
and others by cheque.
Another reason is that the experience and
training of "Wales" officers enable them to
give me valuable assistance in financial
matters.
Then, again, I like to avoid unnecessary risks, and
it is a comfort to know that my more valuable
personal possessions deeds and securities are
safely deposited with the "Wales”. They hold
my will, too.
Take my advice: let the "Wales" look after your
financial affairs. It saves much needless worry;.

Special Note
to Ex-Members
of the Services
The period following dis-
charge has its special dis-
tractions. We understand and
sympathise with those who
during that period think of
anything rather than study.
With one exception the entire
Instructional staff has had the
experience.
But most of our pupils,
with or without reminder
from us, resume study after
a lapse of a month or two.
Will those whose private
addresses are unknown to us,
and who in consequence can-
not be reminded by letter,
please advise us of their
addresses? If this is done on
a Work Sheet we wilt be
better pleased. To them and
to others who may have de-
layed work for one reason or
anotheT we say: Come along
—start again. The obligation
is twofold: we give, the
pupil takes. The pupil must
go through the motions of
taking. He must write to us.
We hope the relatively few

THE PELMAN INSTITUTE.
H.M. Forces
Members of the Services, still serving
or discharged, are accepted as pupils
of the Pelman Institute at a reduced
fee. The Pelman Course is approved
under the Commonwealth R.T.S.
Application can be made through the
Unit Education Officer or other
relevant authority. The Course has
been approved by the War Office,
London, since 1939.
Promptness of Service
with your widely recognised
and respected promptness, 99
The quotation is from a letter dated July 31, 1946. The writer is in the navy and is
not a pupil of Pelmanism. What he asked us to do was done on August 5, the day on which
we received his letter.
Thirty-nine years ago when the Melbourne Overseas Branch of the Pelman Institute
was opened, those in charge of it determined that from the first inquiry to the completion
of the Course the utmost promptness would mark the Pelman Institute’s correspondence with
its members. This rule has been faithfully observed. There are two motives. The first has
business value: the inquirer is fully informed about our work whilst his interest is still
keen. The second motive has the force of a moral obligation; only by the prompt return of
a pupil’s work can he get the full value of the instruction. To so act that he will get the
full value and get it quickly is our obligation.
During the war years we have enrolled nearly 11,000 service men and women. In spite
of the business difficulties and the personal anxieties inevitable in a state of war our rule
of promptness was strictly observed. We intensified our efforts, quickened our office processes,
simplified the routine so that in both the tutorial and the dispatch departments correspondence
was dealt with promptly. Only in special circumstances was there even a slight delay. We
discovered, checked and used the quickest way of reaching men wherever they were ahd we
found time for the words that cement friendship. To our minds there could be no delay and
we saw to it there was none.
Our civilian pupils, of -whom there were many, benefited also. The urgency to clean
up the work of each week before the week ended included them, and every one got prompt
as well as full attention. ,
“He who gives quickly gives twice,” is as applicable to a course of training as it is to
charity. Applied to the Pelman Course of Training it means an early opening of the pupil’s
mind and a realisation that he already possesses powers which by cultivation will add to his
stature as a worker and as a citizen. He will work more easily, move more comfortably
amongst other people, and be fitted to cope successfully with the changes and the problems
which are part of the everyday life of all of us during this post-war period.

Electricity in S.A.
In the middle of the election excitement
that burst on Adelaide early this month
the new State Electricity Trust quietly
took over from the old Adelaide Electric
Supply Company, thus turning a private
show into a Government enterprise. In
addition, Premier Playford announced
that the Trust would also assume control
of Leigh Creek coalfield in order “to
ensure effective co-operation between
local fuel supplies and the electricity
undertaking.”
Two of the Trust’s first duties are to
set about supplying the settled districts
north of Adelaide with electricity and to
look into S.A.’s “alternatiye fuel sources
so that industry in the State can operate
without disruption”—in other words, to
put S.A. beyond the power of the Com-
munist-run N.S.W. Miners’ Federation.
Shareholders in the old company have
the right to cash their shares at the market
value ruling on Aug. 1, ’45, or they may
take debentures of an equivalent amolmt
in the new undertaking, half for five
years and the rest for 10 years at 4 p.c.;
but there will be a deduction if assets of
the company, held in England, are not
turned over to the. Trust. The assets are
not acquired under the Act.
Last July the company’s chairman,
J. S. Murray, sent the Premier a valua-
tion of the company as a going concern
at £13,075,829, and claimed that on this
the Government’s compensation of share-
holders was £3,154,929 short of the real
value of the company’s assets. This the
State Auditor-General described as being
based on “unsound hypotheses” and gave
tabulated re&sons for so describing it,
whereupon the Premier politely informed
Mr. Murray that there was nothing doing,
that the matter wouldn’t be resubmitted to
Parliament, but that he would table the
relevant papers in Parliament. There the
matter rests while S.A. settles down to
see whether its new State enterprise can
function without ultimate loss to the tax-
payers—if it does it will be a rare speci-
men among Australian Government ti ad-
ing enterprises.
Chairman R. T. Vanderfield, address-
ing shareholders in Vanderfield and Reid,
Ltd., emphasised the injustices of double-
taxation of company shareholders;
On previous occasions I have spoken of
double-taxation on dividends. It is very
disappointing that as yet there is no in-
dication of the removal of this anomaly.
In fact, Mr. Dedman, as spokesman for
the Government, has stated that the non-
allowance of a rebate does not involve
double-taxation, and that the Government
will not at present consider any radical
departure from the present system.
A simple illustration shows that there
definitely is double-taxation:
A public company whose taxes usually
average 10s. in the £ would have to earn
£20,000 of profits to enable it to pay
£lO,OOO to its shareholders, the other
£lO,OOO going to the Government in taxes.
The proprietors of a partnership, however,
which earns £lO,OOO receive the whole of
this amount and then only pay personal-
exertion rates on it, whereas the company
shareholders have to pay the higher property
rates on their £lO,OOO of dividends. Surely
it is time to rectify the anomaly of com-
pany proprietors receiving dess for them-
selves out of £20,000 of profits than part-
nership proprietors do out of £lO,OOO of
profits!
Another illustration:
Company A, in addition to its ordinary
shares, has £lOO,OOO of 6 p.c. preference
capital. As public-company taxes average
approximately 10s. in the £, the company
has to earn an additional £12,000 to pay
£6OOO taxes and £6OOO preference dividend.
Company B, instead of preference share-
holders, has £lOO,OOO of debentures, so that
if the rate of interest is 6 p.c., it would
only need to earn £6OOO extra to pay the
interest, as such interest is allowed to the
company as an expense.
It does seem reasonable, therefore, to
expect the Government to revert to the
pre-war system and allow a rebate on
dividends in the hands of the shareholders.
If there are difficulties in reverting imme-
diately to the pre-war system, could it not
be done in two or three stages —say a
rebate of one-third for this year, two-thirds
for next year, and the full amount in the
third and succeeding years? Also, in the
transition period, probably the rebate could
be confined to allowance in regard to the
standard company tax of 6s. in the £.
Referring to his own company, Mr.
Vanderfield stated that, allowing for taxes
paid by shareholders on dividends re-
ceived, “the actual result is that the
Government has received in taxes four
times the net amount that shareholders
have received,” adding, “I really feel
that the present basis of taxation is an
absolute bar to incentive.”

The Commonwealth Bank in the year
to June 30 last made a net profit of
£4,158,354. The surplus on the note issue,
included in the foregoing, was £3,089,405.
This profit is derived from the sale of
notes to the trading banks, and the pro-
ceeds of the sale (a credit balance) are
used to buy Government and other securi-
ties, which, of course, bear interest. The
Commonwealth Savings Bank made a
separate profit of £1,511,857, this taking
total Commonwealth Bank earnings up
to £5,670,212, compared with £5,511,356
m the preceding year. Consolidated
revenue was handed £2,939,405 of the
latest profit, £937,684 went to the
National Debt Sinking Fund, £640,950
to the States under savings-bank amalga-
mation agreements, and £1,152,173 re-
mained to add to capital and reserves.
Earnings by the Commonwealth Bank are
far greater than those of all the other
banks in Australia combined, the biggest
portion coming from the note-issue sec-
tion.

B.H.P. shareholders watching the de-
clining sharemarket with concern should
take notice of the fact that one Sydney
broker is reported recently to have had
a parcel of between 10,000 and 15,000
to sell, and this selling has done a great
deal to satisfy those at present prepared
to buy shares at high prices. Another
thing to remember is that B.H.P. is the
extremely efficient owner of an industry,
strongly financed and conservatively
valued, that is prevented from earning
satisfactory profits merely because of
poor coal production. This coal position
will have to be overcome at all costs,
otherwise industry generally will be in a
hopeless state —an unconscionable thing
considering the excellent working and
mining conditions prevailing on N. S.
Wales fields. The profit-earning pros-
pects ahead of 8.H.P., as well as possi-
bilities of expansion, are excellent pro-
vided fuel and labor are available. The
co. also has a strong case as regards the
Prices Branch if it feels that higher prices
are necessary.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Atlanta”: Herb Mitchell, the drover,
was a man short for the trip; then he
picked up Jacky near Bollon (s.-w.
Queensland). Two days out from the
township the abo lost the new pair of
hobbles. “That’ll cost y’ ,ten bob,” Herb
told him. “Y’ can’t buy leather,” The
next morning, Jacky’s horse jerked away
and smashed the only spare bridle they
had. “That’ll cost y’ a quid,” Herb
yelped, “I told y’t’ be careful tyin’ that
horse up. Y’ ought to know y’ can’t buy
leather.” Jacky patched up the bridle, and
at the dinner-camp a week later hitched
his nag to a wheel of the wagonette. The
horse promptly sat back on his haunches,
but nothing happened until the abo tried
vainly to untie the knotted reins. Then
he borrowed an axe from the cook, and
he had the job completed when Herb
arrived. “What the hell do y’ think y’re
doin’,” the drover screeched, “choppin’ a
spoke outa the wheel o’ me wagonette?”
Jacky looked surprised. “Gripes, boss, 1
didn’t wanta cut the reins. Y’ can’t buy
leather. But there’s plenty o’ wood!”
# * * *
“Bo”: It had been a matter of feverish
speculation in the Carlaw household
as to whether young Tom was “holding
his hat up” to Millie or Joan Kershaw.
Even old man Carlaw, whose whole life
revolved a refund his fine Jersey herd,
occasionally made brief but dry comment
on Tom’s lack of decision. Millie was
the younger and had a mop of red hair ;
Joan, a brunette, had gone arty, and had
her hair cut short, Eton fashion. Tom at
length announced to the family that he
was going to marry Millie. After the de-
lighted squeals from the girls and Mum’s
congratulatory kiss, old man Carlaw got
up from his seat by the fire and wrung
his son’s hand. “I’m glad y’ picked the
red heifer, son,” he said slowly, “I’ve
never bin keen on polies, meself.”
jS * * *
“Fang”: Harry lived in a derelict
humpy at the bend and had been drawing
the old-age pension for years. The other
day I noticed where he’d been renovating
his dwelling and had a dozen fruit-tree
seedlings freshly planted. “Stirring things
along a bit,” I commented. “Yairs,”
said Harry. “A cove don’t realise these
things till he’s gittin on a bit. Should’ve
done it years ago, of course, I’m goin’
t’ git a few chooks later on, an’ I might
even run t’ keepin’ a cow. Reckon I
might as well have things comfortable
f’r when I make up me mind t’ settle
down an’ retire.”

“Sou’-west”: Here in Westralia there is
nothing better than redgum or kino for
the tanning of fishing nets or fines. I
have a big prawn net still in use which
had its first dip into the redgum brew
20 years ago,

“Horseless Horseman”: New Guinea,
“the green hell of, the north” to
so many, contains many idyllic beauty
spots, f and my idea of a dream
lake lies there near Tomakot vil-
lage on the n.-e. coast. Not half a mile
in length, its crystal-clear fresh waters
are bordered by high, clifflike, tangled
masses of intertwining jungle growth,
and as you laze there in a canoe gazing
at this intriguing wall, with its varying
hues of greens and its splashes of red
glinting under a brilliant tropical sun,
multicolored birds call all about, and
overhead martins fly in dozens. Peer
underwater and you find a subterranean,
hedgelike maze of pale-green chickweed,
and in this natural aquarium fish abound,
as do likewise duck. But these days the
village coons never trouble game cm the
“big water,” since they aver a huge
monster called the Marseilles had
lately taken up his abode there. What-
ever we did we must not shoot or “blow”
fish in case we chased him out! How-
ever, the sight of the eight-foot crocs
passing the canoe was too much for my
cobber. Back home his sheila wanted a
pair of crocodile-skin shoes, and—you
know what it is—one day we returned
with a couple of Jap rifles. We inter-
cepted only one saurian, though. As it
suddenly came alongside we both inad-
vertently stood up together and took
aim. The canoe overturned. How we
felt swimming with that saurian can best
be imagined, but back in the village the
coons still recount how the Marseilles
was “cross too much” and tipped us in
the drink!

“Zake”: Apparently horses occasion-
ally like to indulge an epicurean taste.
Saw a light draught in a paddock in
which there was plenty of clover and pas-
palum. But he had used his forehoof in
mining operations and had to a depth of
about Sin. uncovered the white roots of
couch grass, which he was nibbling fas-
tidiously. And, after all, why shouldn’t
Dobbin occasionally have a two-courser?

“R.E.”: I strolled into the bar on
sale day to see Joe Wheatear gloomily
surveying his schooner. I inquired the
reason for his lugubriousness, “It’s me
implements,” said Joseph, staring with an
unnatural lack of enthusiasm at the con-
tents of the vessel in front of him. “Y’
“O.K., boss-you gibbit baccy, dis pfeller showem Way Bullabulling.
know I bought ’em on hire purchase.
Well, the company threatened to take ’em
back if I let ’em rust out in the open, so
I went to a, lot o’ trouble buildin’ a shed.
It had brush walls and a straw roof.
Then -the blasted insurance cove comes
out, takes a screw at it and reckons he’ll
have to double me premiums because o’
the increased fire risk. Now, I ask you!
What’s a bloke to do?”
“Chook”: Tell “J. Dale” (B. 21/8/’46)
that his rooster in showing the pew
arrivals in his harem the way into the
laying boxes was merely obeying a far-
off call of the wild. Any rooster worth
his wheat, or any Muscovy drake, either,
will always get around at the beginning
of the laying season trying out the likely
nesting places. Numbers of cock birds
in the wild do much the same thing.
* *. * ♦
“Gravelsnatcher”: The bulldog,
generally accepted exemplar of all the
canine virtues, hasn’t the well-developed
sense of duty of the well-bred kangaroo-
dog. It’s hard to understand the urge
that impels that bom killer to leave his
freshly-slain quarry and return to lead
his master to the kill, but it can’t be ex-
plained away as training. A dog will
show his kill or he won’t. A cur will
learn to kill if he knows it’s kill or starve,
but the finest and fleetest of killers can’t
be induced to show if that sense of duty
hasn’t been bred into him. A dog coming
back to show doesn’t merely retrace his
steps'. He seeks his master and leads
him to the kill by the shortest possible
route —no mean feat when the chase may
have led him for miles through strange
country. And if, in the course of “show-
ing,” he starts another ’roo he will ignore
it unless ordered to chase. Moreover, the
best “show-er” is the keenest guardian
of his master’s property. Once endured
in silence the gibes of some locals whose
nondescript mongs chivvied my dog as
we passed through on the way to a hunt.
My dog never hesitated to attack a ’roo,
and he had several boomers to his credit,
but he had an inexplicable fear of other
dogs, and would run from a fox-terrier.
As we passed that same mob on the way
home Brindle was trotting quietly beside
his kill, which hung draped across the
saddle, when the mongs charged. This
time they met a fanged fury who demon-
strated to them and their owners the
effect an inbred sense of duty can have
in dispelling a born fighter’s inferiority
complex.

“Sur Cingle”: It was a woman novelist
and her grown-up son who hit a little
northern S.A. township that is noted for
’Ghans, goats and gibbers. The lady was
sitting with a good slice of the popula-
tion one evening when, from the other
end of the verandah, a call for “Mother! ”
in tones of considerable urgency roused
all hands. Everybody rushed to the scene,
it being assumed that some tragedy, such
as the leaking away of the town’s beer
supply from its keg, had occurred,
“Mother!” the thrilling voice went on as
the assorted footwear of the populace
skidded to a stop. “Just look at this
sunset!” “And it wasn’t much of a sun-
set either,” grumbled the bloke who told
me the yarn,

“C.L.”: Five black swans are to be
sent from Melbourne Zoo to Mr, Chur-
chill, whose zoo must be one of the most
extensive private collections in the world.
During the war he was presented with a
lion by the Zoological Society, but as
lions are not suitable for house pets he
left it at the zoo, occasionally taking an
hour off from running the war to feed
it a juicy titbit and caress the four cubs,
which he named Alamein, Bizerta,
Mareth and Tunis. The gift must have
brought to Mussolini bitter memories of
the “good old days” when he was over-
whelmed with animal gifts from the feuda-
tory chiefs of his African colonies, sym-
bolising his lionhearted courage, belli-
cosity and inexhaustible energy. The gifts
included lions, horses, leopards and
eagles. The Victorian swans will not be
as embarrassing as animal gifts occasion-
ally are. When Kipling was staying in
Brazil as the guest of the Brazilian Gov-
ernment, he received a live armadillo
from an admirer. He kept it for a day
and then sent it back with a polite note
explaining that life in a hotel was “too
terrible for an armadillo.” The most em-
barrassing gift on record was offered to
Queen Victoria by some Swazi chiefs.
“We come, O Great Mother,” chanted the
spokesman, “to bring to you our babe.
Take him, O Mother, to thy knees ; fold
him to thy breast.” The “child” was a
stalwart Swazi, 6ft. high, weighing 16st.

“Lower Tops’l”: Some fbreigners find
their way to outlandish parts of the Com-
monwealth. Knew a remittanced Swedish
count, whose lonely homestead was tucked
away in a gully under rugged Cape
Frankland, Flinders Island, with nothing
but miles of beaches, mountains and
wallaby pads between him and neighbors.
Anchored under Frankland once in a
crayfishing ketch, the skipper and I were
asked ashore there to “dinner.” Being
ushered inside by a bowing butler was
something we crayfish blokes weren’t used
to, and when, after taking our seats at
the table, the old count stood up as
though to speak, we felt a bit more un-
comfortable. The skipper looked at me,
and there was a strained silence until the
butler signed to us to stand up. Then
our host in accented English apologised
for the absence of soup. With no wine,
potatoes, liqueurs or anything much be-
yond mutton and duff, we all stood up so
much during that dinner that the skipper
declared later it was worse having a
meal there than going without one.

“M.U.R.”: On four separate and dis-
tinct occasions I saw snakes come at
milk (B. 11/9/’46). On a 14th-street
vineyard in Mildura a brown snake dis-
appeared among the gear in the imple-
ment shed. The boss armed me with a
s.-b. 12-bore gun, posted me just outside
the door, placed a saucer of milk in the
doorway and ordered me to wait. After
a long half-hour that snake appeared
and was just putting its nose to the milk
when nose, milk, saucer and some of
the doorsill vanished in the gun’s blast.
On Tapalin station, near Euston, a saucer
of poisoned milk got a black snake. On
the Ovens, out from Everton (Vic.), a
hop-picker’s wife stepped out of the hut
and almost fainted to see her infant
daughter cooing pleasantly as she held
forth an enamelled mug from which a
tiger snake was taking lacteal refresh-
ment. A brown snake that had made a
home in the junk in a shed behind the
Commercial hotel in Forbes (N.S.W.)
came to a violent end through being
seduced from hiding by a saucer of milk.

“Propalong”: The mustering camp was
at the old Claypans Hut trying to eat,
sleep and extract merinos from the
scenery in a non-stop gale direct from
Mt. Erebus. They got there late the first
night, savage with hunger aifd miserable
clean through with riding in that awful
wind. “Have t’ leave this front-door open
the way this fireplace is smokin’,” snarled
Long Bob. So they ate their scran, chilled
by the icy draught and with their eyes
watering with the smoke.
Next night Johnny suggested
leaving the back-door open.
Profane opinions were offered
as to whether the draught
was more or less, but every-
one agreed the smokiness was
just the same. Riding in
with sheep the following
evening the camp held council
and decided that the smoke
was worse than the lurid
cold, so that night they froze
and suffocated with both
doors open. The next night
was their last at Claypans
and old Tom got up from the
tea-table and slammed both
doors shut. “We get the
blasted smoke anyway,” he
growled. “Might as well be
warm with it.” Everybody
was too miserable to argue
and the meal went on. The
last tinplate had been shoved
away when Johnny noticed
something. “ ’Struth,” he
announced in an awestricken
whisper, “there’s no smoke!
Whereupon, thinking back
on the last three nights, the mob turned
in in disgust while the fire burned clear
and bright in the warm, smokeless room.

“Moira”: Foxes choose black chooks
not only because they are less likely to be
seen with them (B. 28 /8 / ’46), but be-
cause they make less noise. White fowls
are more alert than black ones and
usually give the alarm to house dogs
when disturbed. Foxes once chose white
fowls as being'lighter to throw over their
backs, but since living in Australia the
fox has increased in size and strength it
not in cunning. Hence his choice of the
precious Australorp.

“Mat’s Mate”: When Mat came off
second-best in a dispute with a Melbourne
tram I put him in a taxi and trundled
him to a hospital casualty ward. There
they X-rayed him and found a
wrist. We must have struck the place
on Student’s Day or something, anyhow
a herd of earnest youngsters gathered
round Mat Sid discussed with a senior
man various aspects of the fracture. Mat
and I couldn’t make anything of their
highly technical words and, as time
passed, I had greater difficulty in restrain-
ing Mat, who wanted to get away. After
they’d picked up his wrist for about the
tenth time and made words and signs
around it and around the X-ray pictures.
Mat suddenly stood erect, shook off a
couple of them and roared, Look, the
flamin’ thing’s broken, ain’t it! All right.
Get a hunk of fencin’ wire or somethin
an’ twitch it up. You blokes gimme the
willies, muckin’ about like this. Cnpes,
I dunno how a bloke’d get on if he come
in here dead. Now splice me ruddy arm
an’ let’s get out.” Five minutes later his
wrist was plastered and slung and out
we walked. “Gripes,” I remarked y
was a bit sudden, wasn’t y’?” He looked
at me, then significantly he looked at a
clock, which stood at 5.50 p.m. then
we headed for the nearest bar.
BUBBLES OF OOMBABEER.
Something that only the gods could give her,
A heart that steadies with crisis near.
Made her the star of the long brown river,
Slim, brave Bubbles of Oombabeer.
Born with the spirit of these brown waters,
Charged with the fire of scrub-fringed plains,
She was the darling of Dawson’s daughters.
Better than men with the rope and reins.
The stockmen tell how a girl lay waiting
At a waterhole on the wild land’s brink,
While the ridges rang to the red dogs’ mating.
Where the scrubbers came in the dawn to
drink.
With words that echo the drumming thunder
Of mustering days where the hoofbeats
burned
They live again through her rides of wonder,
No risk too great till the lead was turned.
True as the sun is the praise they give her
Who give no praise to a worthless hand,
Their eyes are quick and their hands are clever
Who judge the folk of the cattleland._
Leave them to yarn by their long brown river—•
The salt, these men, of the ridge and plain;
They love the brave, and they vow that “Never
Her like will ride in the leads again.”
QUEENSLAND.
LEX MCLENNAN.


“B. A. Ker”: He opened the gate and
drove right up to the house —the high-
pressure salesman whose hair was as
sleek and shiny as his flashy car and whose
tongue was even oilier than his thatch.
Dad was away, and Mum, good-natured
soul, wasn’t the type to rebuff anyone.
The “boom”. from the direction of
the car didn’t rise above the noise of
his verbosity ; it came again, and stopped
him in mid-sentence. The third repeti-
tion sent him running to the protection of
his property, protesting as he went: “I
say, this is too jolly bad! He’s ruining
my car.” For a second the immaculate
figure stood before the shining vehicle
like a modern Horatius —then his nerve
broke before the hurtling menace. The
impact materially assisted in the start-
ing of the car. And as the dust cloud
rolled back Mum happily returned to her
ironing, while Billy, the poddy ram,
trotted back to the cart shed in triumph,
well pleased with the way he had dealt
with the impudent jumbuk that had
stared at him from behind the shiny
duco.

“Nor’-west”: I thought at first “Bray
Rock” (B. 28/8/’46) was a fisherman, but
it turns out he’s merely an angler. Let me
tell him what real fishing is. We always
fish with a cotton clothesline and three
hooks strong enough to hang up a sheep.
When we strike the snapper schools we
often hook three fish. Not much good
fooling around and gaffin’ with that load
on. Also, we generally have a kero.-tin
full of cut-up mullet for bait. We drift
to fish, so once we strike them there is
no time to be lost. At the end of the
drift we put about and sail up to the
marking buoy and drift again. Often
we- lift 100 big fish inside a few hours;
by then we are usually out of bait and
have to make either to a whiting patch
for more or back home, where the long-
shore fishermen supply us with mullet.
Then, of course, we have to gut our fish —
snapper goes to market like that.

“Old-timer”: In the semi-darkness of
the transhipping yards at Terowie (S.A.),
we were putting through a sheep train.
The method was to back the narrow-
gauge train up against the broad-gauge
train, open all the end doors of the vans.
And the wicked baron gave a love potion to the beautiful princess
drop the small connecting platforms pro-
vided, place upper and lower ramps to
connect the trains, then force the sheep
along the corridor thus formed. It was
a hot and sultry night and “Brownie,”
the smallest man on the job, was put in
the vans to start ’em running. “Brownie”
grabbed a couple of woollies, dragged
em across the first ramp and held ’em
just inside the door until the others saw
them and started across. After that.
while we hooshed and pushed along the
sides, “Brownie,” bent double or on
hands and knees, had to keep ahead of
the sheep, frequently grabbing decoys
and using them to attract the others.
The heat, semi-darkness, noise and
activity confused the sheep and made
them stubborn, and it took us over an
hour to tranship them. By that time
“Brownie,” in among a lot of sheep, was
almost exhausted from his cramped
movements and physical struggles with
the jumbucks. Then the train supervisor
decided that some of the vans were over-
loaded and ordered us to ease them back.
“Brownie,” glad of the blessed relief this
mearit for him, got his back against the
bars of a van and dozed. Presently the
supervisor was satisfied, we drew off and
Paddy, who’d just come on shift, was sent
along the loaded train to make sure no
sheep were down. With a short stick he
poked a few to their feet; then we heard
him yell and rush back to us. “Blime,”
he gasped, his eyes sticking out, “there’s
a talkin’ sheep there. Jabbed him an’ he
bucked an’ yelled, ‘What are y’ cornin’
at?’ Gimme a scare, it did. Talkin’
sheep!” He sank bewildered on to the
platform and we went along and rescued
“Brownie.”

“A.J.W.”: “Frank Mauri” (B. 4/9/’46)
repeats a misstatement when he attributes
the peculiar spelling of some Melanesian
words to shortage of type in the early
mission presses. All “F.M.’s” examples
refer to Fiji, so I suppose it is to the
Fijian language that he refers in par-
ticular. The spelling of the sounds of mb
as b, net as d, th as c, ng (as in singer ) as
g, and ng (as in finger) as q were origi-
nated in Fiji by the first European mis-
sionaries, Revs. Calvert and Cross, The
former records that when he spelt a word
such as “Lakemba” the natives tended
to pronounce it “Lakemaba.” When he
cut out the m his pupils told him that
now he wrote words that could be under-
stood. This mode of spelling still pre-
vails in Fiji, and to a lesser extent in
other Pacific groups. Civilisation would
be relieved of many a headache if the
spelling of other languages could be
made as simple and consistent as Fijian.
* * * *
“Homo”: I cannot agree with “Zake”
(B. 21/8/’46) that the bushfire “sends the
wind” in front of it, although a big blaze
always creates a strong and dangerous
wind. The wind follows the heat always.
As the hot, dry air rises in the region of
the inferno, cool air is drawn in from all
sides, but as the fire races along in the
direction most favorable to its progress
the strong wind must follow. It will
be noticed that it is not a low wind, as
might be expected, but one in line with
the tree-tops. The extremely hot air
lower down is driven upward so strongly
it takes the right-of-way without argu-
ment. At tree-top level it is overpowered
by the air being drawn in from every
direction to form one torrent rushing
after, and into, the vacuum created by
the flying flames. In the scrubby gully
described by “Z.” the two essentials for
fire and speed were present: fuel and a
draught. The draught followed the
flames, but would outstrip them, too, be-
cause it didn’t have to wait to feed it-
self as the fire did. Therefore it blew
fore and aft the hellship,
“Alpine Willie”: Fires do create
draught. I recall a mountain fire that
took three days to burn down into a
valley and raced to the top on the other
side in as many minutes. The hot blast
leading the flames shrivelled leaves on the
trees as high as 50 feet. The speed with
which two fires link up is further evidence
of draught, and there must be an increas-
ing suction in the pocket between as the
two rows of flame close up.

“Hanko”: We could hardly believe our
eyes when Wun Sin padded into the hut,
placed a large watermelon on the table,
and padded away without comment.
With a whoop of joy. Snowflake dived at
“I wish you hadn't taken the silencer off, Bert — I'm getting quite a
headache.”
the big fruit, carved from it a halfmoon
slice, and thrust his face into the pink
mush of it. Bailey, glaring with distaste
at the guzzling abo, cut himself a por-
tion, took a bite, gave a hollow groan
and collapsed on the floor. “Don’t eat
it,” he gasped, writhing like a stricken
snake ; “the Chink’s poisoned it.” Big
Joe shied away from the bite he was
about to take. “Cripes, I thought Jhere’d
be something wrong with it,” he said.
“Mix me some mustard and salt and
water,” moaned Bailey. Little Joe was
no time getting the emetic ready. “Give
it first to Snowflake,” Bailey murmured
feebly, “He’s eaten more melon than me.”
“Down it, Jackie,” Little Joe urged, hand-
ing him the mixture. Snowflake gulped
it; his Adam’s-apple went suddenly acro-
batic, and he dived for the door. Ten
minutes later he shuffled shakily into the
hut. By that time we’d eaten that water-
melon to its uttermost rind.
* * * *
“Sofran”: “Zake’s” widow Patterson,
who lugged the shrimp to the altar (B.
14/8/’46), reminds me of the McDougals.
Being without chick or child, Mrs. Mc-
Dougal at length induced Sandy to go
with her on a selection visit to the Child
Welfare. They returned home with a
baby boy. On the minister’s wife ex-
pressing her surprise with “I thought it
was a girl you were wanting, Mrs. Mc-
Dougal?” the good lady was a trifle
apologetic. “Weel, an’ so it was. But,
ye see, we had a glengarry cap in the
hoose! ”
* * * *
“Bull-ant Bill”: When I looked in with
the weekly paper Old Joe was admiring
his new shave and hair-cut in a cracked
mirror. “Didn’t know you were going to
town,” I said, “I’d have got you to bring
out the letters.” “Travellin’ barber done
ithis job, Bill,” replied the old boy. “Fust
'l’ve seen along ’ere fer years. Pulled up
fer some water fer ’is rajiator an’ I
thought as I’d take the chanst. Ain’t ’ad
it cut fer munce. Good barber, too. Not
like old Dinny wot useter be in Woop-
pitty w’en I wuz timber-gettin’ there.
’E’d lamed the trade orf corpsuz, ’is old
man bein’ a undertaker in Ireland. ’E’d
send Dinny along ter shave ’em so’s
they’d look all right fer the wake. Useter
say none uv ’em never made no com-
plaints an’ ’e never drew a drop er blood.
My oath. Bill, the livin’ ones wasn’t like
that when Dinny got ter them.’*

“Billjim” :• Apropos the bunny (B.
28/8/’46), early records reveal a curious
dispute between Batman and Fawkner.
Batman had incited an aboriginal, Bullet,
to liquidate some rabbits belonging to
Fawkner. Fawkner, on complaint, was
awarded 555. damages.
* * * #
“D.R.H.”: The tapeworms, generally,
are wonderful creatures. Perfectly
adapted for life in two host animals,
they manage to live without exertion by
“soaking up” digested tucker in the in-
testine to whose walls they Cling by
means of hooks or suckers. The adult is
composed of a series of sections; each
section grows to sexual maturity with a
complete set of male and female organs.
Fertilisation can take place between two
sections of different worms, between
two sections of the same worm or by
self-fertilisation. After impregnation the
whole section becomes a bag of eggs—
the male organs degenerating—which
breaks off and passes out in the fasces.
Some of those eggs picked up by a
grazing animal, develop in it to the larval
stage and, when that animal is eaten by
another, grow to the adult in the new
host. Dogs, being unclean feeders, some-
times get infected with a tiny tapeworm,
Echinoccus, about an eighth-inch to a
quarter-inch long. These tiny things
may not do the mong much damage, but
their eggs, transferred in a dog’s saliva
or in water from which the poodle has
drunk, may enter a man’s body and there
grow to the larval stage in the form of
hollow cysts which may be as big as an
orange. So next time your dog tries to
lick your face hold him off. A post-
mortem section of a human liver with
hydatid cysts is not a pleasant sight; and
to die after recurring fits or even mad-
ness due to the presence of the larvse in
the brain is much worse than being blown
up by the cartridge with which Henry
Lawson’s dog gambolled around.

“Blime”: “Y’d better watch out fT
them bally cattle in the back paddock,”
Dad warned the newchum. “Don’t get
between an old girl an’ her calf. There’s
some of ’em’H come t’ meet y’.” “C-cripes,
what’ll I do?” The new hand looked
concerned. “You give old Brown her
head, an’ leave it to her,” said Dad.
“That mare’s been bred out with the
’roos ’n dingoes, an’ she knows a thing
or two.” Dad was milking that evening
when a bedraggled, sorry-looking wreck
limped into the yard. “One o’ them
bailies in the back paddock,” groaned the
newchum, propping himself on the fence.
“But why didn’t y’ leave it t’ Brown?”
gasped Dad. “I did. Y’ see,'” explained
the hand, “I was fair in the middle o’ the
paddock when I seen one o’ them big
brutes blowin’ her nose at me an’ kickin’
up dirt, so I jumped f’r Brown an’ let
her go. Trouble is, that nag lived too
long with them ’roos ’n things, an’ learnt
too flamin’ much —must’ve learned how
old Ma Too chucks out her joey when
she’s pressed too hard.”

“Dronestung”; Tracing relationships
among bees is not quite as simple as it
may seem. In an established hive the
underdeveloped female workers and the
drones are offspring of the queen; but
though the drones are full brothers, their
relation to the workers is obscured by
one-half. This comes about by what is
known as parthenogenesis, whereby the
royal mother lays fertilised and unfer-
tilised eggs and both kinds hatch. So
the workers may claim full rights of being
born in wedlock, and the drones bear
the undeserved stigma of having no
father. If the queen is purebred her
drone progeny will be true to the strain,
and this trait is handy in bee-keeping.
With purebred queen? and an overplus
of their drones in an apiary, the chances
are that most new queens will mate satis-
factorily, but the honeymoons are con-
ducted on the wing and beyond human
interference. Any illbred drone from a
wild hive in the vicinity may chance on
the scene at the right moment and prove
himself the better bee.
RISING WATER.
She’s brimming bank to shady bank,
The word has passed in glee,
One foot more flood, sheTl spread her grip
To the lush flats and there run free.
From seven years of water low
The swampland arid lies,
Now the oily stream’s from gum to gum:
The Murray’s on the rise.
Good news for cheerful river folk,
The word is passed with zest;
Soon bream will breed and skulking cod,
Wild duck and swan in reedland nest;
Dark gleaming snags are trembling loose,
The healing water thrusts and plies
In silted pools now scouring clean:
The river’s on the rise.
Riches for all the river brings,
The magic words gain pace;
Our river life will hum again,
Brave Marion and Hero race.
Beneath the willowed island marge
The treacherous currents prise,
And laughter ripples, echoing on:
The river waves still rise.

Wool-price Factors.
“Delaine”: The wool trade is in a
state of flux during the change from war
to peace conditions. The change in
manufacture from military to civilian
cloths is easy enough, although the
greater diversity of pattern for civilian
manufacture may slow down production
by comparison with the huge bulk orders
in plain weaves. Rehabilitation of firms
and plants which were closed down for
the duration in England takes a little
more time; the principal difficulty is in
getting the erstwhile operatives to return.
Many have acquired a distaste for mill
life and will not return if they can help it.
Main factors affecting prices at present,
however, are the artificial “floors” and
“ceilings” which have been established.
Demand is so keen and world consump-
tive capacity so great that the “floor”
established by J.O. is not expected to be
tested to any great extent for some time.
In Britain the price of tops is limited
for the home trade, but there is no price
limit on material for the export trade. The
U.S.A. also has maximum prices bn tops.
This explains why British and American
manufacturers have so far been unable
to compete with European and Australian
mills at the wool sales.
The Australians are in a privileged
position. They have been authorised by
the Government to pay more than the
ordinary market price if necessary, any
excess which would result in making a
trading loss being repaid by a subsidy.
This actually means that lots bought by
the Australian mills at prices consider-
ably higher than export level result in an
indirect Government subsidy to the
grower. The British Government, strain-
ing every nerve for further exports, has
lifted the ceiling regulation on wools
which are to be used for export manu-
facture, so that British buyers may be-
come more active on suitable wools,
though it is difficult to see how the wools
for the home and export trades are to be
kept separate.
Veterinary Tools.
“W. Court”: The business of stock-
rearing has its own tools of trade. It
isn’t enough to buy an expensive veter-
inary book and believe you are equipped
to handle every emergency that may arise.
You may know what should be done
but, lacking the right tools, you may not
be able to do it.
Every dairyman, for instance, should
have a probang. Cattle will chew large
turnips, carrots and similar root-crops,
and get large chunks stuck in their
gullets. If you don’t work fast you may
find victims dead of suffocation. The
probang is an instrument specially
designed to go down the gullet and shove
obstructions out of the passage.
Trochar and canula should also be
found on every dairyfarm—to give relief
in otherwise hopeless cases of bloat.
And, although hypodermic injections
have largely superseded the old air-
inflation treatment for milk fever, a teat
siphon is worth keeping in case you have
to resort to the old method. Mastitis
and other udder troubles are often caused
when the udders of cows are inflated with
air blown through a dirty bicycle pump.
A good enema syringe is invaluable
for dealing with stubborn constipation ;
small syringes are a necessity for clean-
ing Out deep wounds. A veterinary sup-
ply house will supply literature bn all
kinds of veterinary appliances that are
“ That'll teach you to pull a swiftie on ME!”
invaluable to the stockman. A few
pounds spent thus will ensure that you
will never have to doctor your stock in
a makeshift way.
The Tick Pest.
“Plane Creek”: Look out for scrub
and dog ticks in Queensland and N.S.W.
during spring and summer months. They
don’t set up tick paralysis until they’ve
been attached to the skin for four or
five days. Dogs, cats, fowls and horses
are their prey. Search every couple of
days for ticks on dogs and cats. The
vulnerable points of domestic animals
are head, neck and ears, and in dogs and
cats the feet. Rarely is paralysis caused
by ticks attached to other parts of the
body, but they can cause nasty sores and
great discomfort and should be removed
wherever they be.
I’m not one for rubbing ticks with kero-
sene to make them let go their hold. I
invariably pull them out at once and
look carefully for others in the neighbor-
hood. I’ve often found two ticks in one
hole. If you miss the little one you can’t
expect your pet to respond to treatment.
By all means dab a bit of metho. or
kero, on the skin puncture to disinfect it
when the tick is out.
Ticks don’t like sulphur. Regular
sprinklings of sulphur may prevent them
from attaching themselves to your pets.
If you locate a tick too late administer
doses of sulphur in milk until the
paralysis lessens.
Salt Patches in Wheat.
“Milton”: E. S. Dadd has a wheat farm
adjacent to salt lake country at Erikin
(W.A.), and was troubled with large
patches of ground which failed to grow
crop. The country has about 14-15-inch
rainfall, chiefly during winter, is about
1500 feet altitude, and carried mixed
morrell, salmon-gum and gimlet before
clearing 15 years ago.
All classes of fertilisers and stable
manure were used, with no improve-
ment until the bare patches were sub-
soiled to a depth of Bin. This got rid of
the salt and an even crop about 3ft. 6in.
high resulted last season, the patches
ripening about one week earlier than the
main crop. This farm is about 40 miles
south from Hines Hill, where Ron White-
head (B. 8/5/’46) is successfully reclaim-
ing a derelict farm from salt by sub-
soiling.
Kikuyu Grass on Tablelands.
“D.C.T.”: The Yass (N.S.W.) district
has an average rainfall, mostly winter, of
22 inches, and an elevation of 1700 to
2000 feet. It is fairly drought-proof,
though some years the fall is much below
average. Winter begins in April and
frosts last up to late October. Kikuyu
grass is already established in a number
of lawns in town and is doing remark-
ably well. Most regard it as a grass suit-
able for tropical, or at best sub-tropical
climates, and the writer was frankly sur-
prised to see the hold it has. The lawn
round the local swimming baths is no-
thing but Kikuyu, and one could not wish
for a better sward. Certainly, that gets
a certain amount of irrigation, but out-
side the baths is a patch of some extent
which gets no moisture save rain.
In other parts of the town are other
patches. Severe frosts, heavy enough to
whiten the couch and blacken all the
dahlias in town, left the Kikuyu flourish-
ing, green and succulent.
The experience in Yass indicates that
it is a grass that landholders might ex-
periment with to their profit. Once
established, it is there for keeps, and pro-
vides an abundance of green feed in the
growing season and useful grazing in the
colder months. Its root system is such
that it can laugh at an ordinary drought.
It will grow on any ordinary soil. Pro-
pagation by cuttings seems to be the only
method of establishing it, but the result
is well worth while. As an agent in com-
bating erosion it has few equals. Accli-
matised cuttings will give better results
than those from other districts.
Breaking In.
“E.H.S.”: It*is a mistake to break a
colt in (B. 5 1 6 / ’46) until he is fairly well
developed. If he is put to constant work
before he is two years old growth will be
stunted and his spirit cotved. Use a
round yard about 25ft. or 30ft. in
diameter. Stand in the centre with a light
rod about 12ft. long with a strip of cloth
about 18in. long tied to it. Bring the
rod up behind the colt, and he will start
off around the yard at a fairly fast pace
to avoid the rod or the fluttering rag.
After a few rounds turn him in the oppo-
site direction, and when he shows signs
of slacking off give him a tap on the rump
and keep him moving, giving him an
occasional rub with the rod from rump
to neck. In about 20 minutes or half an
hour he will steady down and submit to
being rubbed all over with the rod.
The rod should never be brought for-
ward further than his ears, otherwise he
will jump back and perhaps injure him-
self on the fence. Continue the treatment
until he stands still, and it will then be
easy to slip a halter on. The halter line
should be about 12ft. long. Start him
off with a touch of the rod and keep a
light strain on the halter as he goes
around, reversing direction occasionally
until he responds readily to the pull of the
halter. Then increase the strain, but if
he attempts to pull back slack up for a
moment and then take another steady
pull. If he comes up to it well and good;
if not repeat until he does. Exercise a
little patience in the treatment, and he
will soon lead freely.
When the colt has been thoroughly
handled on both sides buckle a roller or
surcingle on him with crupper attached,
and put a bridle on him with the bit in
his mouth ; then draw the reins back and
buckle them to the roller at each side
so that the bit bears lightly and evenly on
his mouth. Let him stand working on the
bit for two or three hours, then slack
the offside rein, and he will keep moving
around in response to the pressure on the
bit. After a couple of hours slack the
near, tighten up the offside and let him
poke around for a like period, then fasten
both reins together and buckle one end
to the near-side ring of the bit, and give
him a few turns around the yard, bearing
lightly on the bit to avoid injury to his
mouth. Remove the rein from the near-

side, buckle it to the offside ring and work
him in the opposite direction.
When satisfied with his behavior, re-
move the bridle reins, replace them with
plough lines and take him out of the
yard and drive him around until you are
satisfied that he is properly mouthed, then
drive him back to the yard, saddle and
ride him, taking care that the crupper is
fairly slack, as a tight crupper will cause
chafing and irritation. If the colt has
been properly handled he will not buck,
and care should be taken that he receives
no encouragement to do so.
From start to finish always keep a light
but firm hold on the mouth, and avoid
hard pulling, jerking the reins or sawing
the bit, otherwise the animal will develop
a “hard” mouth. The colt should not be
ridden for more than an hour when taken
out for the first time, and he will be much
easier to handle if he is accompanied by
another horse. The riding lessons should
be lengthened from time to time until he
has become accustomed to his work.
Keep him to his regular paces, and never
allow him to develop a jog. Accustom
him to having his feet lifted, and never
ill-treat him.
Hints for the Farm.
“Billjim”: To estimate the deadweight
of lambs halve the liveweight and deduct
21b. Thus if liveweight is 761 b. take 21b.
from 381 b., leaving 361 b. as dressed weight
to be expected. The live lamb can be set
in a kerosene case on the scales. Weight
of the case would be allowed for. With
reasonable care there should be no risk
of bruising the lamb.
“C.S.”: Nicotine sulphate is in short
supply in N.S.W., and chances of obtain-
ing supplies for the 1946-47 horticulture
programme seem remote. So nic. sulph.
is controlled, and sale will be permitted
only for horticultural purposes, the order
of priority being (1) vegetables, (2) or-
chards, (3) home gardens. Two fluid
ounces is the maximum amount that may
be sold without a permit. Apply to the
nearest agricultural instructor, fruit in-
structor or fruit inspector.
“Lub”: Wainut bacteriosis or black
spot is hard to control and tons of nuts
must be lost through it annually. Spray-
ing with Bordeaux mixture 4:4:80 before
the female flowers open, again after set-
ting and a third time about 10 days later
will help. Burn all spotty leaves and nuts
that fall and make a job of cleaning up
around the trees soon after the leaves
shed in autumn. Nurserymen now offer
varieties resistant to bacteriosis.
“Sari”: Where surgical operations have
to be done on stock, do them before the
summer. Bleeding is more serious in hot
weather than in cool because the blood
is thinner, flies are very active then and
likely to infect raw wounds. Never
operate on an exhausted or excited
animal.
“Sundowner”: Spaying is used for cul-
ling undesirable breeding heifers. As a
management practice it eliminates the
necessity of separating the heifers from
the bulls or steers. Fat, spayed heifers
under two years produce carcasses that
compare favorably with those from steers
of the same age. They also command
higher prices, as buyers are usually sus-
picious that open heifers are with calf.
Like castrating, spaying should be done in
cool weather. Losses resulting from the
operation when properly done are very
small, being little more than those from
the castration of bulls.
“Plane Creek”: To green seedspuds
(B. 28/8/’46), we always spread them
out on moist ground in a shady place.
Excessive heat is apt to shrivel tubers
and shoots, too, if and when they appear.
A layer of grass keeps them in the dark,
and hides them from the potato moth ;
shooting is strong and rapid.
“Bennie”: When feeding the ducks in
the morning save a little of the bran mix-
ture and give it to the working dog.
Bran is an ideal laxative and will not
harm the hound in any way.
“Jersey”: Most mastitis cases are
contagious, but so far we have managed
to keep it under control in our little herd
by isolating all infected cows and attend-
ing to them after all the other cows have
been milked. Wash the hands in disin-
fectant and hand milk; do not use the
machine. Milk into a bucket containing
disinfectant and not on to the floor. Have
a separate bail away from the main shed
where the healthy cows are milked.
“W. Court”: The site of an old lantana
clump is a good place for test plots of
grasses. The soil there is usually easy
to cultivate and contains plenty of organic
matter. Pumpkin vines bear heavily on
such land. But after the first burn, the
remnants of the lantana should be
gathered in a tight heap some distance
away for the final bum. Two huge fires
on the same spot are likely to render the
soil sterile and prevent anything from
growing there.

public works, and to provide funds
necessary for the rehabilitation oi
ex-servicemen and women.
In addition, your investment in
Security Bonds helps keep prices
down and speeds reconversion of
industry.
If you have £lO or more saved
already, you can make an
advance subscription to the
Second Security Loan at once,
and interest will be paid there-
on from the day you make your
investment through any bank,
savings bank, or stockbroker.
Interest is at the rate of
31% for 12 years, or 2% for
three years.

ment TO-DAY.
“People’s savings speed conversion of industry
says Mr. R. A. Rowe, Chairman of Australian
Associated Stock Exchanges.
“Money placed in the Second Security Loan
has undoubted security,” said Mr, R.. A. Rowe.
“The loan has the backing of all the assets of
Australia and all political parties are pledged to
honour it,
“The rate of interest is attractive, when negoti-
ability and security are taken into account.
“It must be realised that thrift
and steady support for national
finances are necessary peace-time
weapons against an increased use
of Central Bank credit. This is
essential to protect us against dis-
astrous unbridled inflation.”
Mr. Rowe emphasised that a
sound investment is essentially one
that can be converted readily into
cash, should the necessity arise.
“This loan fully measures up to
that requirement,” he said. “Any
member of the Associated Stock
Exchanges will secure cash for your
investment in the Loan more easily
than for any other security, mainly
by reason of the extensive and
regular buying operations of the
national Debt Sinking Fund.
“But, while emphasising this
feature of Commonwealth
securities, stockbrokers do not
encourage their clients to sell
because they cannot recommend
a sounder investment.
“Furthermore.” continued Mr.
Rowe, “they realise that the task of
conversion from war to peace-time
economy requires the marshalling
of the people’s savings.
“For these reasons, members of
the Stock Exchanges have no hesi-
tation in recommending the Loan
as a first-class investment.”

about the movement of his hands, all the
more noticeable because his once trim
body had by now gone somewhat to
Since his retirement from the ring—un-
defeated, as editor Kirwan had written—
Andrew had had one main ambition: to
breed and own what he himself had been,
a champion. His directly personal effort
in that respect went a little astray, turning
out a daughter ; but from time to time he
had tasted the vicarious pleasure of his
ambition. Horses like Trump and Mafe-
king and the Valley’s unbeaten William ;
setters like Lady Twjnkle, and pointers
like his imported Prince of Isles. All of
them satisfying in their way, but none of
them wholly what he sought. That had
been left for Whiskers to complete. Not
only a champion, as he himself had been,
but a champion in what had been his
own line ; and providing another, special
satisfaction on top of that again.
It excited Andrew with a fierce joy to
see Whiskers being provoked on the road
by some strange cattledog, most likely a
champion, too, in his own neck of the
Valley, but an extremely unwary tyke
to get his hackle up and start snarling
around Whiskers.
As they circled around, teeth bared,
snarling, Andrew was back in the ring
they had had to put up in the middle of
the Showground. It was never any of
those fights with Snowy Pearce and the
others in the old Red Room over Mar-
conti’s and Samovar’s Restaurant, with
Jim Marconti reiterating, apropos of any-
thing or of nothing, the only English he
had then acquired, “No good for to cry.”
True enough: it was no good for to cry
in the Red Room. Not that anyone ever
did.
But it was none of the fights Andy
Nolan had had in the Red Room that
came back to him when a fight promised
for Whiskers. It was Sandy Greigson
always * that afternoon in the open-air
ring in the Showground, with the crowd
the Red Room couldn’t have quarter held.
They had come there from all parts of
the Valley ; in their sulkies and buggies,
on horseback and on foot. The ringside
seats were the chairs from the Red Room
and others mustered from the Com-
mercial and from wherever they could
be got. At the back of those were the
forms the school had been good enough
to lend (in exchange for a couple of ring-
side seats), and back of those again were
the several hundred who were pleased
enough to stand and see the fight.
It had been arranged, and with all the
cash they could muster among them to
back their man, by the big camped gang
who were then bringing the railway line
to the Valley. And in the Valley there
was more than enough cash to back
Andy Nolan.
The fight was over 20 rounds: Nolan in
his plain blue trunks ; Greigson in green
with white stripes at the side. A close,
muggy afternoon, with, when they
stepped into the ring, a storm threatening.
And round by round, from when they
shaped up, it became more and more evi-
dent that whoever won was going to earn
his laurels.
Greigson, too, was a big man; more
square-shouldered and whiter-bodied
than Nolan. He seemed smaller, because,
in the early rounds, he fought crouched,
going for the body. It suited Nolan.
As tough down there as the Valley’s iron-
bark, he had also a good body defence,
while his straight lefts were gashing
Greigson’s right temple and jabbing his
right ear to pulp.
At first the crowd was noisy, but as
it went on the grim steadiness of the
fight steadied them too. Between rounds
they looKec at the sky, dramatised for the
occasion with thunderous, swelling dark
clouds, pressing down with threat of rain.
Greigson had straightened from his
crouch, and was doing better. It was
a grim, even fight still; both of them now
showing reddened marks of it: Nolan
from a broken nose and a cut oyer his
right eye ; Greigson from the bulging ear
and the deepening gash in his temple.
Then, .in the 15th round, the threaten-
ing rain started. It came ominously, in
great heavy drops. Before the round was
through it was falling thick in a drench-
ing torrent. It kept on to the end. But
the blood of the two of them was up.
Each had taken enough numbing punches
to the body and to the head to be aware
of nothing but his blind purpose.
As for the crowd, it was that sort of
fight they had paid and hoped to see,
and rain down what it liked they were
going to see it. The big men in the ring
had reached the stage where they fought
now instinctively, with little of science or
art. Over those last five rounds they
strode out from their corners and slogged.
At every punch the water spurted in thin
squirts from the gloves. At almost every
punch the hitter or the one hit slipped
on the wet canvas and went down on his
knee.
The heavy rain fell on their shoulders,
and coursed down their bare bodies,
breaking in cascades over the tops of their
trunks. Both were bleeding freely from
their eye and temple gashes, which be-
tween rounds their seconds could do
nothing to stop in the downpour. Carried
by the pelting rain, the blood coursed
down over their bodies in a crimson
wash. •
And for all that, when one of them
slipped on the wet canvas the other stood
poised and waited for him to get on his
feet. Then they stood and slogged again.
The crowd, hunched in their dark
bivouac in the rain, now yelled and
shouted from dripping mouths at every
water-squirting punch. The fierce spec-
tacle of blood and spirit was nearing its
end: on the part of both big men in the
ring a terrific demonstration of the tough-
ness and gameness of the breed.
Greigson, the young, sandy-haired
railway-gang worker, would have the
marks of it in his pulped ear and the
deep gash on his temple to recall it for
the rest of his days. So, twisted nose
and wide-opened right eyebrow, would
Andy Nolan, undefeated champion of the
Valley.
This is how he figures in the record,
and how he deserves to figure, on game-
ness, if nothing else.
Mustering up a terrific power from
some fierce source in the second-last of the
20 rounds, Sandy Greigson drove a right
swing to the body that staved in a couple
of ribs. It was a punch which Andy
knew was a good deal better than any-
thing he himself could then or at any
time unloose. He went down on his hands
and knees ; but he was up again, and
they put it down to his slipping.
Greigson, his fighting brain numb
from those straight lefts to the gash on
his temple, accepted that along with the
crowd. Had Greigson known, And}
Nolan would not have survived that
round and the next.
It was a popular win: Nolan on points.
But Andy knew who the winner was;
and he knew it was his own last fight.
SO the sadly mistaken cattledog shap-
ing up to Whiskers was Sandy Greig-
son always. And Whiskers had an open-
ing line of attack that turned Andy's
heart young again with excitement.
Suddenly, as they circled, Whiskers
would twist and hurl forward—to Andy,

cattledog knew what had hit him,
Whiskers would have him by a crushing
grip on a front leg or a death grip on
his throat. ,
Cattledog Greigson would know he a
been fighting before reputable Town
citizen Mr. Andrew Nolan asserted him-
self. One hand then would fasten on
Whiskers’ hackle; the other would dive
into his leather jacket and out with the
tough piece of hickory, to insert it
through Whiskers’ mouth and prise open
his clamped jaws. .
There would be a yell of indignant ra = e
from the thus-denied Whiskers ; a howl
of relief and a shrieking retreat by de-
feated cattledog Greigson. And And\
Nolan would pat Whiskers on the
shoulder, and call him the champion oi
the Valley, a title that Whiskers had no
conscience or reason to dispute.

The correct way to put on a hat,
by grasping the brim at front
and back, as compared with the
incorrect way, by pulling it
down from the sides.
Good hats are scarce—take this
hint and preserve the smart
shape and snappy appearance
of your "AKUBRA."
2. Always brush WITH the nap—see arrow.
3. When rain-soaked, push out dents, turn
up brim, and stand hat on level surface.
4. Always rest SIDE of hat on hat pea—
this allows hat to hang clear.
5. Never allow your hat to be placed In a
pile with other hats.
6. Turn out leather—this allows per-
spiration and hair oil to dry out.
7. When laying aside a hat, put it away
in a hat box.

She chose to be a mother to him.
Ah, well, if undismayed he tried
To find a less inconstant bride.

To choose himself a helpmate like

“A short-sighted cow wandered through the
kitchen door of an abandoned house in Abseca
(New Jersey) and info the living-room.”
On our small mixed farm we used to
suffer a good deal from the sociability
of the animals.
It was a common thing to find that my
charger Ulysses had preceded me to the
breakfast table and was eating my
cereal with every sign of enjoyment.
When I retaliated by eating the contents
of his nosebag I soon found to my chagrin
that there was, in fact, little difference
between the two types of food.
My wife suffered great loss of social
status in the neighborhood due to a mis-
taken impression that our cows lived in
the house. This arose at an afternoon-
tea party at which the hired girl had
failed to put any milk on the table. My
wife’s call for some milk, delivered fortis-
simo, brought six of our intelligent cattle
in from the paddock. They lay down
contentedly on the carpet and began eat-
ing the daisies in its design. My wife’s
sarcastic remark: “Go on, make your-
selves at home,” being misinterpreted by
the visitors, only made matters worse.
My eldest son added to the congestion
by keeping nine Muscovy ducks and a
black swan in his bedroom upstairs. As
the birds all took their exercise in turns
in the bath, personal cleanliness became
a matter of some hazard.
It may have been this, combined with
the difficulty of getting goats out from

“Yes,” said the chairman at the meet-
ing of comrades, “I think we did a fair
job, gen’rally speakin’. I can say without
fear o’ contradiction that ‘Pig Iron’

mucked up an’ that we struck a blow
for the proleterriet an’ our ole pal Eddie

work it might mean gittin’ a bigger bonus

“I ain’t so sure about Eddie, though,”
protested one of the unwashed. “Ain’t

“All the same,” went on the other,
“I can’t see ’im makin’ much of a com-
missar w’en the revolootion comes. We
know ’e ain’t got any reel guts w’en it

“Who said ’e’d ever be a commissar?”
roared the chairman. “It’s one thing
makin’ use of ’im now, but another thing
w’en ’e ain’t no further use.”
“Anyway,” said another, “we can
forgit that Alick now. I’m more con-
cerned about if we’ll git our deposits
back for all the seats we’re in for.”
“Wot are y’ concerned about that
for?” asked the chairman. “We’ll git

we? Our Fiihrer ain’t let us down yet
with ’em, an’ ’e ain’t likely to now.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

A Hopeless Case
I have been young and now am old,
and I am wondering how I can mend my
ways before it’s too late.
I must admit that during my life
I have not been a “good Australian.” I
had the misfortune to be brought up in
the unenlightened days at the end of last
century. 'ln those times thrift was
considered a virtue, and men like Car-
negie, Rockefeller and Cecil Rhodes, who
left enormous sums of money for the
care of the sick or the encouragement of
science and education, were looked upon
as public benefactors.
Of course we ‘know now how wicked
it is for anyone to be wealthy—the
socialists and Communists have shown
us that mankind can be happy only when
there is no capital and we all share to-
gether in scarcity and want.
It’s hard to get rid of the prejudices of
one’s youth and early training, and I’ve
never learnt to be properly wasteful and
improvident. I’ve even saved and in-
vested money, and so I suppose I’m
one of the capitalists who are draining
the country of its life-blood. Worse, I
still feel that I would prefer not to spend
all I have, but to leave it for the benefit
of someone else after I’ve gone. It’s hard
to get rid of these heretical notions.
As far as I can judge to be a “good
Australian” in these days you must do as
little work as you can for your wages,
you must spend any surplus you have in
some unproductive manner, and must
take particular care never to help either
your country or anyone else. You will
then have the reward of belonging to the
ruling class.
It is a difficult ideal for a person with
my prejudices to live up to. • I have
thought, perhaps, the best thing for me
to do would be to realise on all that I
have and live on my capital. I should
not then be guilty of the offence of having
“income from property,” an offence met
with penal taxation. By spending all
that I had during my lifetime I might feel
that I was living up to the ideals of the
“good Australian.” This would certainly
add to my peace of mind during my de-
clining years. Unfortunately, however,
most of my securities are at a considerable
premium, and I fear I might not be able
to get rid of all the money they would
realise before I died. My frugal habits
are a great hindrance and my years are
running out.
I am afraid ray case is hopeless.—
I, E. G. (Vic.).
Service
I live in a humble side street within
easy reach of an equally humble shop-
ping centre. For 20 years I have been
served by the same tradespeople across
tiny counters in one-window stores. The
butcher, baker, grocer, fruiterer and
chemist have grown old in my service, or
have been succeeded by their sons. Not one
harsh word from either side of the counter
has marred our mutual friendship.
There have been no crowded clearing
sales, no frenzied fights for bargains to
interfere with our discussions of weather,
health, family affairs, or local gossip. No
doubt the unfailing courtesy, the study of
my peculiar tastes, and the appreciation
of my jokes are in some measure due to
the profit motive on the part of the seller,
just as my patronage is due to selfish
interest in my own comfort and con-
venience as a buyer. But asi we are both
benefited and both satisfied the question
of ethics can be ignored by all concerned.
As for the samples of zoning, rationing
and coupon clipping we have all ex-
perienced lately, they make me think with
terror of a possible future. A future
when all private trading may be
eliminated, when I may become a
mere number on an index or in
a queue, fed, clothed, and even
doctored by unsmiling strangers who
have no motive to be kind and no time
to be courteous, whether they are wrap-
ping up a bunch of carrots or removing
an appendix. My experience has proved
that there is a lot of sentiment in busi-
ness : it has also convinced me that there
is no soul in bureaucracy.— Samson (S.A.).
The Farmer’s Pay
I hate to chip in on anyone else’s
argument, but it seems that “Adam” (B.
4/9/’46) got his farming lyiowledge from
comic strips or the radio. I got mine
the hard way.
Generally, the dairyfarmer begins work
at 4 a.m. He knocks off at about 6 p.m.
Subtracting an hour each for breakfast
and lunch, and another for two smoke-ohs,
leaves him an 11-hour day for five days
of the week —he may save a couple of
hours on Saturday, and, with skilful
organisation, about four hours on Sunday.
That’s 71 hours a week. Statutory holi-
days, Christmas Day, Good Friday and
other double- and treble-rate days, are
just numbers on the calendar to him.
Will “Adam” work out what that
would amount to on the basic wage,
allowing full overtime? He can also, in
fairness, allow interest on the capital
value of the farm.
A poultryfarmer has much the same
hours. He has to see his chooks off the
perches in the morning if he is going to
make a success of his job. A man
running poultry has to have a good set of
legs under him —he has a thousand little
jobs which keep him going from here to
there and back again. Both my dairy
and poultry farms were classed as
modern, with all conveniences.
I’ve been at wheat- and sheep-farming,
too. Although sheepmen have some
breaks, they also have rushes. They may
get off for a fortnight now and again,
but sometimes they have to go for long
spells without any shuteye at all. Over
a year the sheepman works longer and
more hours than the dairyfarmer.
“Adam,” to gain knowledge, can verify
the foregoing by buying and working a
farm himself. Perhaps he might organ-
ise us to work by the clock and to meet
on those mythical “sales days” and dis-
cuss /our “grievances.”—H. L. (Q.).
Building Costs
It isn’t necessary to go back to a past
generation (B. 11/9/’46) for proof of the
immense increase in the cost of building.
In 1934 I had a four-roomed seaside cot-
tage built. It was 25ft. by 19ft., had un-
lined weatherboard walls, tongue and
groove partitions and floors, and
galvanised-iron roof, all on substantial
sft. stumps and of good quality materials.
It cost, including all labor and materials
and a 500 gal. tank, £9B 15s.
In February of this year I decided to
extend the cottage to accommodate an
ex-servicemen with a wife and two chil-
dren, The extension, consisting of a bed-
room and closed-in verandah-dining-room
with fibrolite lining and ceilings, measures
24ft. by 12ft.
The lowest quotation—from the
original builder, a personal friend —was
£lB5. Two others amounted to £2OO and
£225 respectively. Galvanised roofing
was unobtainable and corrugated fibrolite
had to be substituted. Another tank,
ordered in March, is not yet available.
Shortages and delays in delivery of
materials extended building-time to
nearly three months. The original job was
finished in a fortnight.— Bray Rock (Q.).
Gone with the War
Of all those old ways and institutions
that have been swept away by the war
few are missed more by the ordinary
housewife than Friday-night shopping.
For many mothers with young children
Friday night was the shopping time of
the week, and the only time during which
they could shop in freedom and comfort.
Such women, now denied the privilege of
city or suburban shopping at leisure, are
at a big disadvantage.
Even in the suburbs, Friday-night shop-
ping was worth while, giving the busy
housewife a chance to get her last-minute
needs for the week-end, or to do some
special bit of shopping unencumbered
with her youngest offspring.
The only justification for abandoning
the late shopping night was the necessity
for blackouts and for conserving power.
Electricity is still scarce, of course, but
there has never been any hint of restor-
ing the Friday-night shopping even when
it is practicable.—D. J. G. (Vic.).
A Masters Ticket
I record the following for the benefit
of any reasonably well-educated and
ambitious young lads who, like myself,
wish to go to sea with the object of be-
coming a ship’s master. I’ve tried it —
and given up trying.
There are two ways. The first is the
hard way—starting as a deck boy or
ordinary seaman and working your way
up. I’d take that on gladly, but those
bulwarks of Democracy the unions
won’t allow a boy to be signed on unless
he has experience. How the devil he
is supposed to get such experience I
don’t know.
The second way is as an apprentice—
you sign indentures with the shipping
company and are trained to be a ship's
officer. This course is practically hope-
less too, because the shipping companies
have waiting lists as long as your arm.
Further, of all the established companies
in Australia, only two take apprentices
or cadets. The Commonwealth River-
class ships also take apprentices, but the
snag is that these large 9000-tonners carry
only two boys whereas similar British
ships carry four. The inevitable question
is: where does the Commonwealth expect
to get future officers for these ships and
for the 6000-, 4000- and 2500-tonners to
be completed in Australia during the next
five years?
It’s worth noting that there are now
at sea many ships’ masters and officers
who returned to the bridge from retire-
ment at the outbreak of war. These, and
others who reached retiring age during
the war, will have to be replaced soon,
but, on present indications, it will be
difficult to find the replacements.
Australia is possibly the most back-
ward of all countries in the training of
future merchant marine officers. Most
other countries have excellent systems
of training, and some maintain training
ships manned and operated by appren-
tices. Surely the Commonwealth auth-
orities could devise some similar scheme
for this country.—l. A. C. (N.S.W.).
“‘Had’ It” ~
The Director of Commonwealth Loans
recently asked traders in the Speck to
invite customers to take their change in
6d. savings stamps. Retailers already
carry a heavy burden with coupons and,
in some cases, have to spend a couple
of nights attending to them. Handling
savings stamps would only add to the
considerable service which businessmen
are now doing gratis. A friend of mine
said he would rather canvass for a £lOOO
subscription to the Security Loan than
try to foist the stamps on to customers.
—Plain Australian (Tas,).
The “Pink Pages”
At one time or another almost every-
one has had to ’phone for a doctor in
the small hours of the morning. All of
the local doctors you happen to know
refuse to come out, so you search franti-
cally through “Physicians and Surgeons”
in the “pink pages.”
How much simpler it would be if,
instead of being in alphabetical order,
all doctors in those pages were listed
in groups under headings such as “Dar-
linghurst,” “Mosman,” or “Paddington”!
If you know a doctor’s name it’s easy
enough to find him in the ordinary part
of the ’phone book, but it’s a long job
searching through the “pink pages” when
you want a doc. urgently in some par-
ticular locality.— Eve Merritt (N.S.W.).
“More than Fitted”
A young friend of mine, discharged
from the R.A.A.F., applied for
mechanics’ training. He was told it
was impossible, as the trade was over-
supplied. Yet every daily in S.A. carries
advertisements for qualified mechanics.
My son came from his demob, inter-
view with high hopes of a reconstruction
course. He had to go back for a voca-
tional guidance test, the verdict being
that he was “more than fitted” for his
chosen trade of refrigeration, but
report must go to P.-W.R. Six
weeks later he received an applica-
tion form which he had to fill in
and sign before a J.P. Weeks went by
without result, so he called at the Adel-
aide office—to be told that he could not
be enrolled as he was not 40 per cent,
proficient. Why couldn’t they tell him
that in the first place?
I know servicemen are not easy tout
in—they are restless and rootless. The
formative years, when they should have
been settling in to their life work, have
been passed in the services. Now they
want to be there without the fag of get-
ting there. But that doesn’t excuse official
procrastination and frustration. —F. H. W.
(S.A.).
Sex Education
Thanks, “Galenus” (B. 4/9/’46), for
an astonishing contribution to popular
anthropology, but experience is against
your conclusion.
It is possible to take too serious a
view of the poor little cave artists and
scribblers who find relief by means of
murals in public conveniences. I once
went from London to Devonshire for
a long week-end with a doctor of
philosophy. We stopped for lunch at a
village inn and visited the appointed
place in the stable yard. The white-
washed wall of this retreat was covered
to an unusual extent with studies of
the rude, and it was evident that the
contributors were under the influence
of a rustic master with talent worthy
of a higher sphere.
Returning that way after our brief
holiday we visited the same pub and
went to have another look at the studio.
All we found was a newly whitewashed
wall. “Vandalism,” said the philosopher,
and walked out. —J. W. R. (Tas,),
The Australian Voice
In pleading for tolerance for uncul-
tured Parliamentary speakers (B. 4/9/’46)
“Hist” fails to see that the boot is on
the other foot. The intolerance is on
the part of the great unread towards
speakers who dare to use polished
periods, who “produce from the palate,”
or who pick up or drop their aitches in
due season. I’ve heard a cultured and
aspiring politician howled down by his
fellow-workers, not because of any
heresy, but because he expressed himself
in a manner “above his class.”
If a man is paid to “voice” the thoughts
of a people he should at least be able
to speak the language of that people and
should not be limited to parroting the
tone and jargon of the least-educated
section of the community. If there is
snobbery in the study and practice of
pure English it follows that Shakspeare
was the perfect snob and that the teach-
ing of English plus phonetics in our
schools is a crime against good
breeding.
Unfortunately our Parliamentarians are
weak not only in enunciation but in
general “usage.” Examples from a recent
broadcast session included “irregardless”
for regardless, “adopt” for adapt,
“record” for record. —A. G. S. (S.A.).
Parliamentary Broadcasts
I think it’s worth a few bob a year to
hear Parliament on the air (B. 14/8/’46).
In the first place, listeners get some idea
of proceedings in House and Senate, un-
biassed by any reporter’s twist. They also
have the opportunity to judge for them-
selves the collective worth of the Govern-
ment and the Opposition. The broadcasts
increase their stock of knowledge, and
knowledge is a necessary adjunct to sane
thinking and voting.
On the lighter side, several debates
have yielded some highly humorous pas-
sages, much more entertaining than some
of the stuff which would have been broad-
cast had the Parliamentary sessions not
intervened—PoLmco (N.S.W.).

“Return to Nauru”
I was one of those responsible for the
investigations that led to the trial of the
murderer of Colonel Chalmers and the
other Europeans on Nauru (B. 28 /8 / ’46)
and also of the murderers (or some of
them) of the Gilbertese on Ocean Island.
The five Europeans who remained on
Nauru were fine and devoted men, as
was Ma Na Fai (B. 4/9/’46), the leader
of the Chinese community on the island.
He could have gone to Australia before
the Japanese occupation, but remained
at the request of Colonel Chalmers.
During the occupation he kept a diary
which proved most useful to the Aus-
tralians when they returned. The diary
was kept, of course, at great personal
risk to himself.
Ma Na Fai told me that Mr. Harmer
and Mr. Doyle, like Dr. Quinn and Mr.
Shugg, stayed behind at Colonel Chal-
mers’s request—Mr. Harmer “to make
up a fourth at bridge,” he said, and Mr.
Doyle because he thought “he might as
well be in it too.” Modest, as well as
brave ; actually, as Ellis has written, they
“volunteered to remain and look after
the Chinese and Gilbertese labor.”
Incidentally, in the early part of the
occupation Dr. Quinn was allowed to
attend the hospital daily under guard.
As he came into the hospital each morn-
ing he used to whistle “Australia Will
Be There,” which the natives understood.
The murder of the five Europeans
took place early in the morning after
the first air-raid in March, 1943. Inves-
tigations into the crime were very in-
tricate. Originally it was believed that
an officer named Sakata was responsible,
and a fairly strong case was worked
up against him. A few days before
the trial, however, Nakayama confessed
and took full responsibility. His story
was that under his direction the Euro-
peans were shot by a* party of five sol-
diers, whose identity he did not know,
and buried by the sea. He denied that any
other officers or n.c.os. were present.
Nakayama’s trial lasted one hour and 15
minutes from the time of his arraignment
until the death sentence was pronounced.
He made no effort to save himself.

28/8/’46) also calls for comment. It is
true that some of the natives had been
armed by the Japanese, but they had
been disarmed some time before the
Armistice. I questioned the sole sur
vivor closely and am certain that there
was never any opportunity for the Gil
bertese to turn on the Japanese.
On August 20 or 21, 1945, there were
215 Gilbertese on Ocean Island. They
were assembled and told that the war
was over. On the following day they
were again assembled, divided into four
groups, each of which was again sub-
divided. The natives’ hands were tied
they were taken to the cliff’s edge, blind-
folded and shot. The shooting was carriec
out methodically, being controlled by the
island commander from his H.Q., just as
an artillery shoot would be controlled.
The only survivor escaped by a miracle.
He fell over the cliff and bodies tumbled
on top of him as the volley was fired.
He hid in caves for more than three
months and eventually told the story.
I, too, was unable to find any refer-
ence in the papers or Parliamentary
reports to the trial of Nakayama. The
date was May 16, 1946, and there was
a full report in the next day’s issue of
“Guinea Gold.”—F. A. (W.A.).
Books and Children
Do most young Australians really pre-
fer American comic strips to decent
books (B. 28 /8 / ’46)?
Children’s libraries provide as good an
indication as any of trends in juvenile
reading. Among books in very strong
demand at Sydney Municipal Library’s
children’s section are Kenneth Grahame’s
The Wind in the . Willows, every lon
Idriess book, Felix Salten’s Bambi and
all of Arthur Ransome’s Swallows and
Amazons series. The library has several
copies each of The Wind in the Willows,
Lasseter s Last Ride and Swallows and
Amazons, yet there, is rarely a copy on
the shelves.
That Grahame’s masterpiece, a favor-
ite of such men as Alfred Deakin,
Theodore Roosevelt and Kaiser William
11, should be so popular among juveniles
suggests that a reasonable section of Syd-
ney’s youth have minds above “Man-
drake” and “Superman.”
Setting literary classics for school study
is not calculated to kill a liking for the
work itself or for good literature in
general. It depends on what choice is
made. Too often selections are more
likely to appeal to a middle-aged pro-
fessor than to the ordinary boy or girl
As a result, youngsters with normal
literary conclude that “high-class”

terest for the normal child is set the re-
action is very different.— Tom (NSW)
H. G. Wells
H. G. Wells (B. 11/9/’46) may live “as
a chronicler of past events and as a
teacher of the scientific verities of today,”
but I think the artist Wells will be re-
membered longer. Science has a queer
way of running over its disciples, and
Wells will probably be superseded and
forgotten by the new generation of
“supermen.”
But who could fail to be charmed by
the delightful novels of the Wells
“romantic” period —Love and Mr. Lewi-
sham (1900), Kipps (1905), Tono-Bun-
gay (1909) and The History of Mr.
Polly (1910)? All are about the “little
man’s pilgrimage” and are biting criti-
cisms of social arrangements and conven-
tions of the period. Through these
novels there run a rich vein of humor
and a deep understanding of the average
man’s hopes, fears and inevitable faults.
If you want a representative picture of
the “little” Englishman of this period read
Wells. He had a lot in common with
Henry Lawson, who was writing at
this time with the same subtle insight into
character and the same awareness of
social injustice.
Wells’s literary reputation was built on
the four novels listed, and posterity will
affirm it. In his later novels Wells has
sacrificed his style and idea of artistic
perfection to stumble after a sterner and
more impersonal call. Ironically,
although he was a tempestuous fighter, he
will be remembered mainly for his quieter
moments. — Delilah (Vic.).
Shaggy Ridge
Like Milne Bay a year earlier, the
Battle of Shaggy Ridge was short and on
a small scale. But it was a definite step
towards the ultimate victory, and should
be remembered in the records of great
war achievements.
In October, 1943, the Japs had been
pushed into the high range which stands
between the Central Ramu and Bogad-
jim. The A.I.F. carried the fighting right
into the mountains, and by the middle of
the month held half of a ridge which, at
a point about 24 miles from Bogadjim,
overlooked the Jap road from Yokopi
to Madang. Then the Australians were
faced with a rocky peak sloping steeply
from the narrow ridge-crest, and heavily
fortified by an enemy who realised its
importance and took advantage of its
propensities. Rising to well over 5000 ft.
above sea-level it commanded the whole
spur. Diggers christened it The Pimple.
Wishing to avoid an attack from the
front, since the narrowness of the ridge
would force the advance to be carried
out almost in single file, Australians spent
two months patrolling far into enemy
territory trying to find a way round the
Pimple. After many bitter clashes with
the Japs this idea was abandoned and the
frontal attack decided upon.
Early on December 27 a joint Aus-
tralian-American bombing attack on The
Pimple was followed by one of the
heaviest artillery bombardments ever con-
centrated into a N.G. half-hour. Then,
after a strafing attack by R.A.A.F.
Boomerangs and some dive-bombing by
the Yanks, the infantry began their peri-
lous assault. The bombing and shelling
had taken terrific toll, but the infanteers
still had to fight hard to rout the dug-in
Japs still alive, and the fighting on that
steeply-sloping peak with sheer drops of
hundreds of feet on all sides was hazar-
dous indeed. Yet, two days later, the
remnants of the enemy were fleeing into
the Faria Valley back of the spur.
Shaggy Ridge was a triumph of ground
and air co-operation, and a tribute to
the toughness of the troops who had
pushed the enemy back into that terrible
country in the first place.— Bondi Beach-
comber (N.S.W.).
Squealers
“W.K.D.” (B; 4/9/’46) accuses me of
squealing because I gave a list of short-
ages embracing almost everything that
makes family life worth living. In the
same breath he shrieks that Australians
are “a nation of squealers” who make no
effort to help themselves.
I have just read a press article that
would warm the heart of “W.K.D.” It
tells of a group of Australians who have
banded together to build for themselves a
community centre comprising hundreds
of homes. Their plan is well organised
socially, financially and architecturally
by self-reliant experts and homeseekers.
But the well laid scheme is marred by
the proviso that it will function only if
and when the non-existent building
materials are available.
Should the practical planners meekly
wait and murmur not, sleeping under the
stars or cowering in caves; or should
they squeal in unison to those responsible
for the shortages?— Hope and Glory
(S.A.).
Our Forests
Addressing sawmillers at Kempsey, the
N. S. Wales Forestry Commissioner said
“We must cut the last acre and the last
stick. We have an export market, and
we must cut to meet it. That is our
policy.”
Prospective home-builders would wel-
come some assurance that this policy is
not going to deprive the local market of
timber supplies within the next few
years. Regeneration of hardwood forests
is slow, the earliest maturing species re-
quiring approximately 60. years to reach
commercial millable size.
The N. S. Wales Forestry Department
appears to have achieved little in the way
of reafforestation. It has a few
forests of imported pine of doubtful
value, but colonial pine forests at Brook-
lana (Dorrigo, N.S.W.), though a com-
mendable experiment, appear to have
been a complete failure. In the west,
cypress pine is rapidly being cut out with-
out replacement, and on the coast soft-
woods are suffering a similar fate. I have
seen thousands of square miles of hard-
wood forest areas where nothing, except
a little thinning out, has been done to
ensure future supplies.
Rather than strive to meet an export
demand by cutting “the last stick and last
“ That's only a reef knot. Let's undo him again and try a
fisherman's bend."
acre,” the N.S.W. Forestry Commission
might make its policy the practical con-
servation of existing forests, plus intense
reafforestation. — Stands (N.S.W.).
Darwin Homes
Under the Darwin Acquisition Act,
all land and property in Darwin has
become vested in the Government, and
residents in the town live there only by
consent of the Administration. The
longest lease obtainable is for five years,
and most people are living under condi-
tions by which they may be turned out
of their homes at a fortnight’s notice
from the Government. And this although
the houses were bought and paid for be-
fore the war, some being on freehold pro-
perty, others held on a 99 years’ lease.
One Territorian who had, in past years,
spent many hundreds of pounds in Dar-
win returned lately to build residentials
and to cater for the tourist trade. He
was prepared to spend £20,000 and to
employ local labor. But he could get no
satisfaction from the Administration, no
definite word as to where land would be
available, and no long-term lease. The
most he could wring from Local Govern-
ment officials was “We can give you a
five-year lease, and a permit to build, but
you’ll have to give a written guarantee
that at the end of the five years you will
pull down your building and remove it
elsewhere.” Who would build on such
terms?
Some people are building, on five-year
leases, but they are erecting shabby shacks
of black iron which are turning Darwin
into a shanty town. Houses built before
the war were cool, airy and conditioned
to the climate, and put up to stay by folk
who were prepared to live in Darwin for
many years. Now these delightful build-
ings, set in beautiful gardens, are to be
destroyed because they lie in the road of
new streets marked on the new plans for
the town. — Territorian (N.T.).
Music ?
Thousands of people from all over
Australia will be interested in the forth-
coming eisteddfod to be staged in Syd-
ney, and many thousands more are show-
ing their appreciation of good music at
orchestral concerts in capital cities. The
Government has wisely encouraged an in-
terest of music by arranging for world-
famed conductors to visit Australia, and
also by sponsoring musical instruction in
colleges, schools and even in the Uni-
versity curriculum.
Strangely, however, the authorities
seem blind to the perversion of such
musical education by the prolific importa-
tion and distribution of spurious and de-
basing jingles, erroneously described as
“popular music.” As every musician is
aware, most of these effusions arc
devoid of all the fundamental principles
which govern the composition of music.
To make matters even worse, the words
are uncouth and ungrammatical, and the
use of them is gravely affecting the speech
and idioms of the rising generation. It
seems extremely foolish to expect cul-
tural development either in good music
or good English while nefarious substi-
tutes are allowed unrestricted circula-
tion.
The argument that such “music” is
popular has no significance. Opium-
smoking might even become popular if
unrestricted. . Popularity of most things
these days is the result of clever propa-
ganda and advertising. Most of the in-
ferior records come from America, where
salesmanship is of a high order and
where large companies are formed to
market the articles. It is not their busi-
ness to consider the ahical value of what
is to be distributed—if Australia is pre-
pared to take rubbish it can be readily
supplied.
The most effective way to deal with
the situation would be to make more
recordings of good Australian music.
There is a wealth of talent available. For
some months past an enterprising firm
has sponsored “Search for Talent” pro-
grammes broadcast each week, and
every one of the contributions (pre-
selected, of course) is of higher quality
than at least 60 per cent, of items on im-
ported records. This “quest” deals only
with amateurs, and there would be a
much wider selection from our profes-
sionals. Visiting conductors have already
urged this point regarding the merits of
our symphony orchestras, and the field is
even broader than that. The surest way
to encourage good music is to make Aus-
tralians interested in their own efforts. —

’Possum Farms
“Horseless Horseman’s” suggestion (B.
4/9/’46) for the legalising of ’possum
farming is an excellent one. ’Possums
will multiply to some purpose if given a
chance, as is very clearly demonstrated
at the Scout camp at Pennant Hills
(N.S.W.). This area of 100 acres was
taken over by the Scouts in 1929 and
made a wild-life sanctuary. There must
be thousands of ’possums there now,
and they have become a real nuis-
ance, eating the young rose shoots, any
fruit on the trees and pinching the Scouts’
tucker unless it is under lock and key,
A little judicious thinning of their num-
bers at the moment would not do any
harm, and, at £36 a dozen, would pro-
vide the hard cash for many of the
urgent improvements required at the
camp. ’Possums are cheeky and fascinat-
ing little brats, but they can become a
perfect pest if allowed to multiply ad lib.
—Mindari (N.S.W.).
