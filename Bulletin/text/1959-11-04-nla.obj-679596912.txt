HAYLEN ON CHINA
At least at the start of his Chinese
Journey (Ang is and Robertson) Leslie
Haylen is likely to disconcert the dis-
passionate seeker after information. He
is so eager to put himself, his readers
or his Chinese hosts into a good humor
that it seems the book is going to
be merely propaganda.
Haylen went to China with three
other members of the A.L.P. in 1957,
and the minute he crossed the border
from Hong Kong he found, he says,
“the propaganda against Red China
was cracking up.” But what propa-
ganda? Surely nobody has suggested
that the Chinese are likely to eat, beat,
torture or imprison favorably-disposed
Australian politicians whom they have
invited to visit them; on the contrary
everybody knows that the Chinese will
feed them, as they did this delegation,
with smiles, statistics and Peking
Duck.
I found myself shaking hands with
a young Chinese man aged about
twenty-six. He had a pleasant
smile... .“Welcome to China, Sir,”
he said 1 felt badly let down.
Surely there should have been a
rumble of thunder, a border skirmish
at least.... ..This was like going from
New South Wales to Victoria, but
considerably less trouble. I had so
hoped for an “incident.” There
should have been at least a whiff
of grapeshot to mark my entry into
China.
Well, if he was so eager to enter
in more heroic style, Haylen could
have tried, say, crossing the border
from Tibet; or he might have tried to
sit down and relax for a few days,
at the right time, on Quemoy.
China, that happy day, was con-
siderably crowded with Australians,
and among them was “a group of
women from Sydney and Melbourne,
a peace-group.” “There was some-
thing pretty grand about them,” says
Haylen enthusiastically, and if there
happened also to be something Com-
munistic he does not say so. “It was
as if they had just picked up their
shopping-bags and set out round the
world looking for peace.”
As well as Australians there were
Indonesians; and the delegation of
young Indonesian workers wearing
red fezes and multicolored Japanese
shirts whom Haylen met at break-
fast were all friendly and cheerful and
“hadn’t heard of the problem of West
New Guinea.” So, presumably, the
problem of West New Guinea does
not exist. In fact it even becomes
doubtful, at one point in these early
chapters, if Communist China exists;
that is, as a Communist State: —
Nobody mentions Communism.
I had been forty-eight hours in
China by this time, and hadn’t heard
the word.
If the whole book were as naive as
this one could hardly advise anybody
to pop it in his shopping-bag; but it
is, in fact, well worth reading, because
once he has thus established himself
(and the Chinese and the Indonesians
and the women peace-groupers from
Melbourne and Sydney) as the best of
good fellows, Haylen is perfectly
willing to tell us, still in a friendly
spirit but in a much more balanced and
responsible way, everything he saw
and heard.
Haylen’s is not as knowledgeable a
book as was Professor C. P. Fitz-
gerald’s recent “Flood Tide in China,”
nor is it so thoughtful or well-written,
but, because he does not use the
professor’s remote and clinical
language but goes in for direct
speech and colorful description, on
the whole it gives you a more vivid
picture of what the country really is
like today. A slum is a slum in Haylen,
even “a terrible slum,” not merely
housing of “minimum standard.” The
bulk of the peasants still live, “for
the time being,” in “hopeless hovels.”
He admits to seeing “ragged and dirty”
children; his description of the women
workers, carting sand in a wicker
basket for £3 a month, is not in the
least glamorised.
In spite of his over-cheerful open-
ing. he is impressed by the Chinese
soldier; he admits that China would
go to war “in certain circumstances”;
and he is emphatic, after his interview
with Chou En-lai, that nothing less
than the complete control of Formosa
will satisfy the Chinese —“The Ameri-
can idea of a Chinese province as a
trust territory,” Chou En-lai told him,
“is not acceptable to China. We must
have the matter cleared-up in our own
way.”
So, when he comes to the more
favorable stories of what the regime
has done—the famous cleaning-up of
the flies and the prostitutes, the clear-
ing of some of the slums, the estab-
lishment of fruitful co-operative farms,
the great advances in industrialisation
that gave him his “week-long diet of
bolts and nuts, coalmines, steel-mills,
lathe-factories and diesel-engines in
Manchuria,” you feel that he is trying
honestly to set down the facts. It makes
a convincing picture of Red China, and
it still looks very like China. If every-
body appears to be full of that amazing
enthusiasm for the regime which so
many other writers have attested —
even to the prisoners who stayed On
willingly in the model prison after their
sentences had expired so that they
could go on learning their trades—•
there is still the hawker selling his
crickets:—
Wisely, the hawker is not crushed
under the regime.... My pedlar was
an old man with a face like burnt
ivory and a million wrinkles. He
was thin and wiry, with a pair of
humorous brown eyes. His sandals
were dusty ifrom trudging along
back streets. His blue shorts were
washed to a whitish grey; his
singlet was white as the driven snow.
On his back was a squirming mass
of singing crickets, each one in its
carefully-made cage of bamboo-
straws.
Haylen will be read with reserve on
the questions of slave-labor and
religious freedom —if you can’t find
the unwilling slaves among 600-million
“willing slaves” it doesn’t mean there
aren’t any; and if there is “no religious

ANOTHER
FIRST .
Do you want the most durable tyre ever built the tyre that brings
you greater safety, mileage, comfort and retreadability than any
other tyre?
Here is is the Goodyear Imperial 3-T Nylon your tyre
whatever car you drive, wherever you go.
It is stronger on the inside because it is built with 3-T Nylon,
the toughest, strongest, most durable cord yet produced. When
nylon is triple-tempered by the exclusive Goodyear 3-T process,
the result is a tyre cord which, weight for weight, is stronger than
the finest steel.
Only Goodyear has the 3-T process therefore only Goodyear
can offer you 3-T Nylon cord!
This means that only Goodyear Imperial 3-T Nylon tyres have
the miracle strength that gives greater protection withstands more
punishment.
You can recap or retread this tyre more times because 3-T
Nylon retains its outstanding strength for the life of the tyre. It
virtually eliminates bruise breaks and damage that would make
other tyres unfit for recapping.
This 3-T Nylon tyre is safer on the outside, too !
The brand new tread design adjusts instantly to meet changing
road conditions and driving needs, responds immediately to
brake or accelerator.
The special tread and the cooler running of the 3-T Nylon
tyre body give much greater mileage. An unusually deep scuff
ring protects against kerbside abrasion.
Goodyear Imperial 3-T Nylon is the most durable car tyre ever
made !

THE NATIONAL LUXURY
TTIIERE is in the latest report of the
A National Capital Development
Commission a gay air of hang-the-
expense that almost exhilarates the
reader —until apprehension about his
income-tax assessment creeps into his
mind.
In Australia’s present state of
unexampled prosperity few people
worry much about the outlay of a few
extra millions bestowed in the right
place, and the £l5 million allocated
for Canberra by private and govern-
mental authorities during the past year
—two-thirds of it by the Government
—seems to be a mere pinch of birdseed
in the current feast of lavish spending.
Canberra has doubled its population
in the past five years, and old hands
revisiting it find it almost a foreign city,
or rather four or five cities each com-
peting with the others in extravagance
and each aloof from the others, living
apart and only venturing into another
domain when a Royal visit or a juicy
Parliamentary scandal acts as a magnet
to pull in the curious from all direc-
tions.
About 900 houses are being built
every year to house the incoming tide
of civil servants, Australian and other-
wise. and those who serve them and
the camp-followers who batten on the
rest. Each of these classes is segre-
gated as it arrives. There is a diplo-
matic suburb which houses about 23
Embassies and Legations, their motor-
cars and their dogs. The diplomatic
inhabitants, for the most part, are a law
unto themselves, driving their cars as
fast as they like, parking them where
they like, and generally assuming
exemption from the confining prohibi-
tions of the common law of the land.
Some of them are beginning to invade
civil-service regions to house their
growing staffs. As competition intensi-
fies, some of the foreign Embassies may
presently have their own suburbs.
There are less distinguished foreign
enclaves round the outskirts of Can-
berra, though the roughest of the
arriving emigres are relegated to the
dark wretchedness of Queanbeyan. a
mere Australian country town, whose
denizens (it would be impolite perhaps
to describe them as inhabitants, as that
term is used of the Canberrans) are
merely allowed to conie into the
exalted capital to work for the privi-
leged. It seems natural that the foreign
“New Australian” element should be
more noticeable in Canberra than else-
where. because Canberra, as the habitat
of the cream of the lords of creation of
the civil service, must naturally have
first stab at the incoming domestic-
service force.
Apart from the foreign diplomatic
element and the foreign-domestic-
service and foreign-laborer quarter
there is the commercial quarter, which
has run away with itself and looks like
Oklahoma in an oil-boom being visited
by a convention of uninhibited uni-
versity students on vacation. There is
more whirling life in it than in
Macleay Street or Lower Collins
Street.
A T one time anybody visiting Can-
berra on a Friday evening who was
lucky enough to espy even one vagrant
sitting on the edge of the raised foot-
path of the two blocks of the Civic
Centre was apt to write home about it
in the same spirit in which corres-
pondents of the London “Times” hail
the first cuckoo. But now the Sydney
visitor on a Friday night sits down
and weeps nostalgically at having dis-
covered the last refuge of the late-
shopping era. which in the capital
cities died with World War 11. The
Civic Centre motor-park looks like
Sydney’s Moore Park during a Test-
match. and the roads (thanks to heavy
traffic and the Diplomatic Corps and
the fact that driving is done in a windy
whirl of catkins from the imported
timber which has replaced the Aus-
tralian gums) are only nearly as safe
for even Sydney motorists as the
Bathurst circuit during a race.
Served by the lavish department-
stores and luxury-shops from Sydney
and Melbourne which have gone up
on what were windy wastes only five or
six years ago, live the monotonous
masses of the public service, each kind
of which looks down a little on the
rest.
When it finds itself outside its own
domain, its own civic compartment
(except on allowable social occasions,
when a white flag goes up and all
tacitly agree to imbibe the same kind
of cocktail at somebody else’s expense)
any one kind of so-called public servant
feels something like a curate out
wandering in Kings Cross.
The only common points of agree-
ment appear to be their watchwords—
“ Expansion Forever” and “Expense
Regardless.”
"pHE projects set-down for comple-
tion during the next five years at a
minimum cost of round £5O million
(present estimate) include huge plans
for new suburbs, with accompanying
outlay on churches, schools, shopping-
centres. roads, parking and tree-
planting. And. of course, the Canberra
Lake, which is to form the central
feature of the city and on the banks
of which the new Parliament House is
to stand beside its ceremonial wharf,
which perhaps foreshadows the addi-
tion to the national capital of three
more cloistered classes —seamen, wharf-
laborers and freshwater-admirals.
The official attitude to this lake
typifies the outlook of the Government
(which, of course, is made for it by
civil - service Canberrans) towards
expenditure on the Australian Capital
Territory. Mr. Freeth, Minister for the
Interior, was almost indignant when
somebody dared to question the pro-
priety of constructing the lake.
It was. he pointed out, only
scheduled to cost £2,200.000 in work
and materials in the next five years,
and he chided its detractors because
“in considering this expenditure over
the next five years, it had to be
remembered that at the current rate of
expenditure, between £5O million and
£6O million would be spent in Can-
berra.” And it seems that “with this
in mind the Lakes Scheme spending
was not a great extravagance in the
natural development of Canberra.”
The sinking beneath the flood of
several thousand acres of land in the
very heart of a capital whose popula-
tion is expected to reach 200.000 in a
generation —acres that could be used
for parks and playgrounds or for more
practical purposes —the obliteration of
these was so trifling a consideration
that the Minister did not even deign to
mention it.
And nobody has yet risen to remind
him of what the £lO million a year
which is now regularly to be spent on
a city used for purely official purposes
would do for some regions of the Far
North which are crying out for water-
supply. ports, communications and
amenities calculated to allow white
families to live in something approach-
ing civilised conditions.
It is very nice to have a pretty
national capital, but in view of the
numbers of major cities which now
exist and the urgent needs of unde-
veloped regions, including those closest
to Asia, it is a luxury the growth of
which needs vigilant watching.


"You can laugh, Sol, but it might be your turn next!"


PLAIN ENGLISH
Peace and Principle
Preliminaries to the so-called Mel-
bourne Peace Conference are a sad com-
mentary on the manner in which many
people in prominent positions have only
to hear the word “peace” in order to
go into transports.
Among those who have made the
slightest inquiry there has never been
a moment’s doubt that the conference is
the baby not only of the Communist
party but of the Russian Communist
party. To the last conference of the
latter it traces back via a Stockholm con-
ference which was held, in large part, for
the purpose of getting together the pros-
pective organisers of a series of such
gatherings and handing-out instructions.
After Stockholm the Communist-party
press at once began to blossom with
advance publicity, and the usual group
of clerics rushed to lend their names to
the enterprise. Their argument is that
these matters should be discussed irre-
spective of who may be present,
ignoring the fact that time and again they
have attended meetings of the same
nature and have afterwards had their
names proclaimed as assentients to
parrot resolutions in double-talk.
At the outset the A.L.P. looked on
the enterprise with a jaundiced eye, but
pressure from within the ranks of the
big Red unions and Dutch - courage
engendered by the appearance of leading
scientists and others outside the clergy
as “sponsors” produced a jelly-like state
in which officials seemed to be doubtful
about whether they should not take the
plunge, if only to annoy the Govern-
ment.
That the heads of the Security Depart-
ment should have been allowed to even
indirectly discuss their attendance with
some of the leading figures who were
due to be present indicates how seriously
authorities have regarded the pro-
ject. That one or two of the most fiery
supporters of freedom of action with-
drew from promised attendance or spon-
sorship gives an idea of how weighty the .
official information may have been.
At present Labor doesn’t seem to
know where to turn. It exhibits a spec-
tacle of groups of strong and indig-
nant men eager to use the occasion as
something with which to attack the
Menzies Government, but not quite sure
how many aces the Government has up
its sleeve.
Dr. Evatt, at time of writing, wasn’t
sure whether or not he was going to the
party. He was taking the almost un-
precedented course of asking the advice
of one of the A.L.P. executive. At the
Federal-executive meeting F. H. Cham-
berlain was all for it —the only sup-
porter of a resolution of the Victorian
delegates on those lines. General-
secretary Schmella was at loggerheads
with Chamberlain on the subject—a
complete example pf the disunity of
Labor on important matters of principle.
Old Brewers v. New Brewers
The Battle of the Bungs in Melbourne
has some piquant phases. The chief
movers in the Australian Hotels Associa-
tion campaign for an increase in the
price of beer by the glass and by bottle
are the protagonists of the new brewery
which they have arranged for a German
firm to build and which they will then
take over.
Carlton and United Brewery, which
has refused supplies to those members
of the association who have put up their
prices—and to those who didn’t promise
not to do so —has been acutely aware
of the arrangement.
This has been kept in the cellar by
both sides. The sponsors of the new
brewery didn’t wish to publicise the fact
that they would soon be in need of new
capital; and Carlton and United were
determined, by thunder, that their rivals
were not going to get some of the capital
by increasing the selling price of their
brew.
At the weekend the battle was veering
C s*, in favor of Carlton, with daily
capitulations by the smaller hotels,
especially in areas where they, were in
competition with brewery-owned pubs ;
but it was an untidy campaign. In
Brunswick one publican put up his prices,
and his father, in competition with him,
put his down a penny. A South Mel-
bourne publican indicated his contempt
for both camps by giving his beer away.
Politically the scrap developed on
characteristic party lines. While the
Bolte-Rylahs picked up their skirts and
attempted to tiptoe out before they got
froth on their hems, the A.L.P. bought-in.
Although it might have been y expected
that the workers’ party would be aghast
at any attempt to lower the workers’
drinking standards, Labor propaganda
was directed against Carlton and United,
on the traditional line that anything big
is bad.
Yet the brewery has an uphill battle
to win public support. The claim that
beer is supplied to hotels at a price that
should enable them to make the chores
of hotelkeeping well worth while has
to be weighed against the continual
surrender of licences in Melbourne.
"Drought and Flood" Serial
In spite of a century and more of experi-
ence, the serial-story of neglect in wes-
tern Queensland and New South Wales
continues, with no end in sight.
It is a dreary tale with two themes
alternating, and chapters that repeat
themselves again and again.
The yarn tells first of drought on a
large scale with graziers going bank-
rupt, cattle dying all over the place, sheep
being offered free to anybody who likes
to carry them away and a universal moan
that rises through the dust like that of
the Bedourie blowing its hardest.
The next chapter is invariably one
which deals with floods that spread over
a 40-mile-wide countryside with the
Culgoa and the Bokhara and the
Narran spreading into a . single lake as
they receive the waters that pour down
from the Maranoa country through the
funnel of the Balonne and swell with
local rains over the flat north of New
South Wales. A chapter of this type
has been read just lately.
For weeks there runs a picturesque
story of postmasters and selectors
isolated, of aircraft performing prodigies
of succor at immense expense, and of
newspaper-reporters even more brave
and enterprising. Everybody suffers
except the mosquitoes, which grow so
red and fat that they look like the van-
guard of the invasion from Moscow.
The muddy waters roll on. In a few
weeks their lifegiving flood has disap-
peared—more water than the Snowy
River dams would hold in a decade. They
leave behind them a countryside caking
into “devil-devil,” which immediately,
however, would bog a duck. The stench
of dead beasts is all-pervading. The
insurance companies send their men
wearily out to assess the damage. The
roads carry processions of graziers going
to ask for time to pay their income-tax
and for loans from their banks.
This sort of thing has been going on
since before Burke and Wills, but so
far the situation has been handled with
a sort of Chinese fatalism, or, rather,
defeatism. The rivers—watercourses, most
of them, except in flood-time—remain
untended, silted-up in the wrong places,
tortuous, changing their directions.
The problem of conserving their flood-
waters is brushed aside on a variety of
excuses. They need straightening, deepen-
ing, grading, providing with lakes or
reservoirs at appropriate places. They
need riparian timbering. But there are
no apologies for not doing any of these
things.
Anybody who has seen the huge works
along the Mississippi knows what even
the engineering of a generation could do
with a mighty river, let alone with a wes-
tern watercourse. Today, with heavy-
duty earth-moving machinery available
and Governments thinking in sums of
hundreds-of-millions, there is no doubt
that something could be done. And
this not only in the country that lies
to the south of the various ranges which
run east to west across Queensland from
the Diamantina to the Dividing Range,
fr-om whose watersheds a score of large
“rivers” and watercourses feed south-
ward into N.S.W., but in other regions
of the west farther north.
A plan to water this western country
profitably is not fantastic when con-
sidered as a long-term plan. It is no more
fantastic than, say, the Montgomery
Canal, which was built 300 miles across
the desert lands of the Punjab more
years ago than it is easy to remember.
It is a great, straight, artificial river with
a fine road, and a belt of trees on each
side to reduce evaporation which came
to yield a substantial contribution towards
maintaining and running the canal and
its irrigation-works.
At least an estimate of the available
water and of what such a scheme (or at
least of what the first parts of a scheme)
would cost should be made at Common-
wealth level. If it is not fully justified
by the expense at the moment it will be
before long as the population grows.


Industrial Peace
If the Summit Conference were to meet
in Australia instead of Geneva it might
set about its work heartened by the
calm of the surroundings. It is un-
doubted that the wars between employers
and employees in this country are over
—momentarily, at any rate. All that the
Communists and their allies can do, even
in the more contentious unions, is to
keep small fights going on and try to fan
discontent about hours and wages.
Recent attempts on these lines have been
mainly abortive ; pretexts for them are
becoming harder to find.
On the coalfields somebody is always
being urged to strike or hold conferences
with the A.C.T.U. abouf a 35-hour week
and more pay-rises, but these attempts
usually fail and the only really potent
causes of strife are “demarcation”
disputes.
Early in the year there was a squabble,
felt throughout Australia, on the issue
of whether the watersiders should be
allowed to leave their native element
and stack wheat in a shed which had
nothing to do with wharves and in
which the A.W.U. claimed its members
had the exclusive right to work.
There’s another demarcation-barney at
Newcastle, where the coaltrimmers have
twice changed their minds as to which
union they should belong to. This one
is led in person by two opposing sets
of Communist bosses.
Despite the closing, temporarily or
otherwise, of redundant mines, the un-
employment issue, on which both the
Communists and Dr. Evatt placed such
high hopes before the last Federal elec-
tion, has proved a weak reed for agitators.
The latest bulletin of the Department
of Labor and National Service showed
that the overall unemployment in Aus-
tralia was 1.3 per cent, in a work-force
of four-million, which is 3.7 points better
than the condition which Federal Labor
used to regard as representing “full
employment.” In Sydney, a city of
two-million, there were only 3734
unemployed registered, and in the main
coalfields centres Newcastle had only 843
in a population of 200,000, while Cess-
nock, talked about as a plague-spot, had
only 563, some of whom had refused
jobs elsewhere.
The state of industrial peace even in
the unions most given to contention is
remarkable. The coalminers in the days
when Federal Labor was in power rarely
passed through a year without endless
loss of time ; it was no uncommon thing
for H-million tons of coal a year to be
lost through stoppages.
Since the Joint Coal Board took over
the industry after the war the number
of men employed in and about the mines
has fallen from around 18,000 to 13,400,
but output has increased from about 11-
million tons to 15,762,000 tons.
The coal-industry used to account for
at least 50 per cent, of all working days
lost through strikes in N.S.W. It
still provides more than a reason-
able proportion, but every year sees a
further movement towards the point at
which stoppages will be reduced to local
and accident types.
Last year saw a considerable drop in
the tonnage of coal lost by stoppages, but
for the first 39 weeks of this year, up to
October 17, only 371,000 tons were lost
as against 636,940 tons in the same
period of 1958. Monthly losses are pro-
gressively dwindling, despite agitations.
The same is true of the watersiders.
Their record has improved substantially
during the year, and a large section seems
to be realising that idle time pays no
wages and merely provides shipowners
with another incentive to mechanise the
handling of cargo.
Muddle of Mt. Isa Loan
[From Canberra]
Public memory will have to be much
shorter than is generally accepted if
Treasurer Holt’s somersault on the
question of overseas loans is to go
unnoticed. Stepping from an aircraft at
Mascot less than three w'eeks ago, after
a round of international financial talks
and lobbying for loans, Holt told news-
men that Australia’s credit - standing
abroad “had never been so high.”
Why, then, couldn’t he raise £2O
million for the Mt. Isa-Townsville rail-
way project?
It is claimed that the conditions which
the World Bank laid down, through its
chairman, Eugene Black, made accep-
tance of a loan impossible. That may
be so, but what’s the matter with Wall
Street, London or (as was frequently
rumored) sources in Western Germany?
Apparently the financiers of those areas
don’t rate Australia quite so high as
Holt would have us believe.
It has now been left to the Federal
Government to advance the £2O million
to Queensland, at the same interest-rates
as would have been imposed by the
World Bank, but not the same condi-
tions. And did the Prime Minister really
mean what he said when announcing the
Commonwealth’s decision?
“The Commonwealth,” he said, “might
borrow part of its contribution overseas
if that turns out to be possible.”
If, after nearly 12 months’ negotiation,
including personal appeals by Holt,
Queensland Treasurer Hiley and Com-
monwealth Treasury-chief Wilson, the
money was not forthcoming overseas,
does the P.M. really think that there is
still a chance of raising it?
No one can criticise the Govern-
ment for having failed to negotiate the
loan, but surely it is carrying things a
bit too far for the Treasurer to say that
our credit-standing has never been
higher.
In Praise of Canberra's Buses
[By “II Vecchio”]
Next time a N.S.W, Transport Minister
wants to investigate modern street trans-
port he should take his eyes off the
United States and cast them on Canberra.
Whatever may be said against the
expensive development of that outback
capital it certainly knows how to run
buses to serve its 40,000 people. To the
visiting Sydneysider they seem some-
thing out of the next world.
The buses are large and convenient;
they provide good seating and have fre-
quent stops. The conductors sit in bays
enclosed save at one side. Fares are dis-
pensed from machines on both one-man
vehicles and those with conductors. The
buses are kept clean and tidy, and
nobody seems to take it into his head to
slash seats with a penknife or scratch
initials or remarks —as often happens in
some Sydney suburbs.
Conductors and drivers have an air
of self-respect which befits their neat
grey uniforms of good material and their
caps with embroidered gold crowns.
They all appear to take an interest in
their passengers and in their vehicles.
They know their routes and the adjacent
streets and they volunteer information
and seem generally friendly and to take
a pride in their jobs. A watch-check
seems to show that generally, serving
crowds which include large numbers of
newly-arrived foreigners and workers,
they cover the ground at a better average
rate than some of the hurtling jugger-
nauts which in Sydney roar past inter-
sections or proceed as if in a chariot-
race after hoarse shouts of “Hurry on,
there!”
Possibly that is because of the dif-
ferent relationship between the bus-
employees and their employers and the
different standards of bus-manners and
general approach to the problem of
moving citizens about that operates in
the A.C.T.
Strange as it may seem, it is possible
to buy timetables on the Canberra buses,
with notes in them about bus-behavior
and -regulations, a map showing the
various routes and a schedule of the
routes and stopping-places.
From this the Sydney citizen learns
things that appear to him unbelievable.
It is never needful in Canberra to hold
a committee-meeting of passengers to
find out where a principal street is be-
cause the conductor hasn’t the foggiest
idea (as is common in Sydney). The
conductor always knows, or can find out
quickly.
There is a schedule of fares displayed
in each bus. At every stop there is a
timetable posted up with the stopping-
times at each place underlined in red
ink. These (normally placed in shelters)
are lighted at night.
Penalties for damaging buses and
otherwise creating a nuisance are salutary
—a steady £25 for all offences.
And at the end of the fare-book is a
note which perhaps does much to explain
why the service is so uniformly good
(if sometimes slightly tardy) and why
there is such general good humor among
employees.
The Department of Interior treats
itself to the luxury of trying to main-
tain good relations with its workers:
“It will be appreciated if passengers
will report any unusual service on the
part of drivers and conductors which
merits commendation. This assists the
management in encouraging desired
efficiency.”
There is nothing about reporting
complaints. One would imagine that
there are very few.

“Kenyas”: When a boy at our school
is suffering from some minor complaint
(such as indigestion or a headache), he
presents himself to the headmaster’s
secretary, who jots down his name, form
and ailment. He then takes the chit
along to the matron, who gets on with
the doctoring. But the other day the
secretary was in a spot of doubt when
a youngster turned-up and wanted to
know if he could see matron and get a
couple of aspirins to relieve his pain. He
was getting over a dose of the cane.

could I be charged? ‘That’s just it,’
they told me. ‘There’s a master-meter at

CELLARMAN'S SORTIE
'T'he bar of the Beehive Hotel was
empty until four of us homeward-
bound from planting a cobber made a
timely audience for the tale. Two of
us had met after a 30-year gap, and
on an envelope-back on the bar-counter
Mac pencilled his address for me. This
was the cue on which the publican
launched his yeasty epic.
“Being able to write your name is
important,” quoth he. For years he’d
been cellarman at a busy city hotel
when one morning the boss, calling him
into the office where there was another
gent., said, “You can write your name,
can’t you, Bill?” and asked him would
he mind signing some papers of transfer
and owning the hotel for a few hours,
signing it away again that afternoon.
Laboriously Bill penned his name a few
times and went back to his job. Knock-
ing-off that evening he was told by the
boss that the lawyer hadn’t got back,
but the business would be fixed-up next
morning.
An hour later Bill in his suburban
local was having a noggin with two
cronies and remarked facetiously that as
a hotel owner he perhaps should not
be hob-nobbing in the public bar with
a couple of riff-raff boot-clickers. He
then detailed the day’s events. To the
enthusiastic suggestion by Tom that Bill
must get a decent cut out of it, Bill
modestly demurred ; but his two pals
kept at him, and practically frogmarched
him to the office of a legal luminary
a few doors from the courthouse, whose
diffuse hours of availability were a happy
convenience.
The lawyer quizzed Bill about what
he had signed, and some difficulty arose
because Bill’s education didn’t include
reading, but it seemed established that
he had not signed a second blue docu-
ment with wafers. Whereat the consul-
tation ended with incisive instruction to
the cellarman that when confronted by
tomorrow’s pen he should speak six
words: “I must consult my solicitor
first.”
Next morning Bill was called in to the
hotel office, and offered the pen, he
recited his set-piece. The boss reacted
as if stung on a boil by a hornet: “Since
when have you had a solicitor.” Diffi-
dently Bill let drop the name of his legal
adviser, and therewith fell a brief, preg-
nant silence. Soft cajolings and hard
vituperations only elicited from Bill his
infuriatingly reiterated piece. The Boss’s
legal gent glumly said that they might
as well retreat to Fitzroy. There, with
some legal suavity and little mutual
cordiality, Bill’s mouthpiece negotiated
for him a tidy sum. The minnow who
in this fishy business had so successfully
forayed amongst the Tritons slapped the
bar with a beefy palm: “And so, gentle-
men,” he concluded, “being able to sign
my name got me the money to buy this
pub.”

TJ/HY will people persist in getting
W married during the cricket-season?
It’s unfair when both rector and
organist are in the team; in fact,
it’s not cricket. A few Saturdays back
we had to scurry away from the battle
and cover those unclerical cricket-whites
with black robes. At the end of the
service I was filling the church with
Mendelssohn and someone came up to
the organ: “Quick! They want you on
the field!” The 11th man! Clearly,
something had to be done. Mendelssohn
was gradually accelerated, distorted into
something even Dorsey wouldn’t touch ;
1 flew out of the church and kind friends
in a car whizzed me up to the field---
just in time to walk out to the wicket,
hit a four and get caught. A disappoint-
ing sequel indeed ; and I felt rather low
about accepting two-guineas for running
Mendelssohn out. —“Eaglet.”

But I found it best to administer hot
whisky as well. The Madame of my

tummy out in front, but her husband
had been away fighting on the Aisne
for a long time, and she was screaming
with abdominal pains. So I plied her
with hot whisky, and then a bag of hot

was better in the morning.

Arthur Pinches, old sth Battalion and

return to Anzac and land there on 25th
April next year, as we did 45 years ago.
Anzac is the only battlefield I ever want
to visit again. But the visitors won’t
see much. The Gallipoli Peninsula is
a fortress-area and planes have to fly
so high the place is passed over in a
few seconds. About two years ago
Colonel Harry Molloy of the sth
Gurkhas came to Melbourne after a
prolonged visit to Gallipoli. It was pro-
longed only because his son was serving
on the Embassy staff in Turkey and
spoke Turkish. Visiting Anzacs may not
have that privilege, unless young Molloy
is still there ; which I doubt.

“Harty”: Does Victoria have hostels
for school - children? N.S.W. has a
splendid one at Wentworth, housing
children from about six to those doing

many for children whose parents live
too far out for them to attend school,
or for orphans, or those whose mothers
have to work ; some run by the Country
Women’s Association. The largest is run
by the Methodist Church, at Herberton.
There are separate houses for boys and
girls, dormitories for scholarship- and
secondary-pupils, and cubicles for high-
school girls. Little girls and little boys
are housed in separate houses, each
with a Matron in charge to care for them.
Children of any denomination are wel-
corned. For £3 a week, everything is
provided. Children from broken homes
can live here in a harmonious family
atmosphere. As far as I know, Victoria
“Ivan! I thought you Were out in outer-space !"
has hostels for high-school pupils ; but
none for the little ones.

“P.0.M.C.”: I was in ruined Peronne

ber that shell-target-practice incident, or
another just like it (B. 21/10/’59). I
was then much older than the 16-year-old
culprit—l was 18. Agree with “Canopus”
that there are many younger First World
War veterans than “Murray Swagman”
says. In the Barambah, which took me
to Blighty in 1918, of the 1100 troops on
board the average age officially was 19
years, and the total included about 100
Anzacs going back for a second issue
of stoush. A schoolmate of mine—
Harry Holmes, of Claremont (W.A.) —
was - killed at the Landing a few days
after his 16th birthday. Indeed, boys on
active service with the First A.I.F. were
almost a commonplace.

“Sanasi”: 1859-1959 in Queensland
has revived argument about how to
pronounce “centenary.” The thousands
of us who will not use “centeenary” were
called to order by a newspaper
columnist: “Princess Alexandra says it’s
‘centeenary’ and if the Queen’s cousin
doesn’t know the Queen’s English, who
does?” 0.k., 0.k., but the next day
when the Princess saw her first koala
up at Cam Reed’s koala - farm she
described the quaint little animals as
“delicious.” My dictionary says delicious
means “highly pleasing to the senses”;
“affording exquisite pleasure”; but surely,
by usage (and that counts, for languages
are never static) delicious has come to
mean “nice tasting,” “good fella tucker”
which koala, roasted, is to the abos.,
but n °t, I should imagine, to Royalty!

“D.A.0.”: Articles in your “Wine

interesting reading. I suggest that mem-
bers of the Viticultural Council should
insist that the white and red table-wines,
also champagne, should be labelled and
classified as “Dry” and “Extra Dry.”
Frequently at a restaurant one asks for
a bottle of wine of a known brand, and
none is in stock ; and you are offered
a brand you are not familiar with, and
the vendor hasn’t a clue how dry it is.

“Lillydale”: The Methodist Church,
announcing their intention of organising
j n Brisbane gingerbeer-gardens to distract
their teenagers from less innocent city
allurements, will, I trust, do the job
properly by reintroducing that gustatory

bottles with string-restrained corks whose
extrusion outperformed beverages by
Heidseck and Mumm. With prudence
t be Wesleyans may avoid the nerve-
wracking experience of the Scoutmaster
whose patrol-members, unchaperoned
during a luncheon break, were on a
scorching English summer day thirsty
customers for village-brewed ginger-
beer whose bland palatability masked


a high alcoholic content. Not only was
it impossible to sustain the project of
an archway of broomsticks for the
emergence of a Scout Commissioner
bridegroom, but limited time even pre-
vented the Scoutmaster removing from
the view of the scandalised wedding-
guests 10 comatose Scouts recumbent

Wilfred Shadbolt, the Tower’s head-
jailer and assistant-tormentor, was very
well taken by Les Andrews, a prominent
Sydney undertaker. But the touch
deemed most appropriate by his fellow-
members of the cast was when, acknow-
ledged a hero after his cock-and-bull
story about having shot the supposedly
escaping Colonel Fairfax, Shadbolt was
hoisted up and carried off-stage in
triumph by the exultant crowd—a live
undertaker, borne out shoulder-high!

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Before Errol Flynn

to see him depart) he had some false-teeth
made by a local jaw-driller. A few years
later an audience at a picture-show at

far together? It’s all the same.” But the

“I for one have noted that a cheerful
manner has replaced an attitude of surliness
among many Government employees, especially

When you run out of luck,
And the tow-away truck
Grabs your car you had left in an
alley way,
It’s a comfort to know
When to get it you go
To the pound, you’ll be greeted the
pally way.
You will quickly begin
To forget your crook spin,
The ebon-black mood that you started
with,
Your near-boiling gore,
As with laughter they roar
While they rake-in the fiver you’ve
parted with.
Your bus-ticket you'd
A bsentmindedly chewed-
Up and tossed-out. Soon after, in-
spectoring,
An inspector gets on.
Don’t go pale thereupon ;
You’ll meet with no snarling, no hec-
toring.
With a grin he’ll declare
That evasion of fare
You'll be charged with. Though that
conjures fearfulness,
It will soften the blow
As you get up aglow
From his strong, irresistible cheerful-
ness.
How much better it is
To observe on the phiz
Of official more joy than ferocity,
As he deigns to explain
That your long-delayed train
Can’t for hours be restored to velocity !
Oh, the public that’s been
In the past all too keen
To be, of its servants, censorious,
Surely cannot now roar
Like a bull if the poor
Coots insist on becoming uproarious!

The City of Trees
Ghosts that Walk at Grafton
By A. E. YARRA
Early in the summer of
every year the people
of the Clarence —the
Big River of the N.S.W.
North Coast demonstrate
their love of life by dancing
in the streets of Grafton under
the lilac-colored jacarandas:
this year’s Festival is due this
week, on November 6, 7 and 8.
Inside the walls of the
Clarence River Historical
Society, in the Town Hall
building in Prince Street, in
the City of Trees, you may
view the relics of the days
of old, and listen to the whis-
perings of the ghosts that walk
in the records of the society,
or that look down at the
visitor from the walls.
There is an infinite variety
of interest in the records stored
in the cupboards cut from the
great cedar giants of the
forests that drew the first
merchant adventurers to the
Clarence ; freemen and bond-
men —the Clarence that was
then called by the aborigines
Brimbo, or Berin.
There is, for instance, the
runaway convict, Jock Brown,
alias Skick, who claimed to
be a Mohammedan. On the
way down from Moreton Bay
penal settlement to Port Mac-
quarie—where Major Innes,
after whom Glen Innes
(N.S.W.) was named, was
superintendent of the convict
settlement —Jock lived three
years with the aborigines as
one of them.
He told the resident magis-
trate at Port Macquarie,
Major Benjamin Sullivan (a
retired half-pay officer), about
the great forests, of cedar and
other valuable timber, the wide
pastures waiting for sheep and
cattle, the big harbor at the
mouth of the river.
A nother ghost who lives
between the covers of a
book of records is that of
Richard Craig, who confounds
the writers of brutal stories
about the treatment of the
“old hands” who were “sent
out” for their country’s good.
Dick got himself sentenced
to death at the age of sixteen
for stealing cattle, and his
father was transported to
Norfolk Island for receiving.
The merciful judge had the
boy’s death-sentence (which
was the set punishment for
theft of anything over a cer-
tain value) commuted to seven
years in irons at Moreton
Bay.
Dick ran away, lived naked
with the blacks, arrived at
Port Macquarie, was allowed
to finish his sentence there as
an assigned servant, earned
£lOO for leading a party to
the river, and eventually rose,
through several stages of pro-
motion, to the position of a
trusted superintendent of a
station.
In the records compiled by
the late R. C. Law, secretary
and historian of the Clarence
River Historical Society, Dick
walks through the pages swing-
ing the axe with which he
blazed the first track from
the New England Tablelands
to the Clarence ; cracking the
whip with which he helped to
bring their sheep and cattle
down through the jungles, over
the ranges, across the rivers,
where they had to raft their
stock (or swim them), tie trees
to the drays to brake them
down the steep pinches, and
use block-and-tackle rigged to
the trees to get them up or
down the precipice-like hills.
HThe ghost that I myself
-*■ got on with best was
domiciled in the frame of an
oil-painting by Tom Roberts,
high up on the north wall, with
a row of other shades.
This was Charles David
Stewart Ogilvie, son of • a
retired naval officer who had
served with Lord Nelson and
settled on the Hunter River.
Charles, in his early twenties,
rode with his brother Edward
up through New England,
crossed the range to the
Clarence, selected Yugilbar,
in a bend of the river, and
eventually built himself a
stone mansion which he
named Yugilbar Towers, but
which the neighbors called
Yugilbar Castle, the place of
the “Dukes of Yugilbar.”
Charles made a fortune out
of stock, and travelled to
Europe. Subsequently he
wrote a book about his travels ;
lived like a fighting-cock, or
like one of the lords of the
land he’d seen in his travels
abroad; insisting on formal
dress for dinner, keeping a
stock of dress-suits for callers ;
drove in a private carriage;
rode the high-horse in local
society; and gave the bands
of aboriginal murderers who
tried to drive him out of the
country all they could take of
their own medicine.
When they’d had enough and
left him and his people in
peace, Charles sought for two
years to meet the leading
warrior of the tribe, and
eventually made a treaty with
him which guaranteed peace
for the whites thereabouts —
man to man, one warrior to
another.
People of the day didn’t
always approve of the view
he took of their social stand-
ing, but the books make it
clear that this was a man.
A bright little shade I found
in one of the cedar cup-
boards was a land-agent of
the ’forties and ’fifties at
Grafton (then known as Wool-
port).
He was having a little diffi-
culty in clinching a sale-
contract for some land. So
in the dark of the moon he
painted a neat red broad-arrow
on the customer’s front-fence.
The customer, knowing that
there was a Government sur-
veyor in the district as a result
of a demand for a railway
from the Tablelands to the
coast, jumped to the conclu-
sion that the arrow was the
surveyor’s mark, and bought-
up all the loose land that was
lying about —at the agent’s
price.
The railway hasn’t arrived
yet, though there is still talk
of it.
And then there was the
20-stoner Thomas Small
and his family, of Kissing
Point, Parramatta. With a
partner, he sent the first ship
into the Clarence looking for
the cedar Dick and Jock had
told of. The little 50-tonner,
the Suzan, tied-up at Illarwell,

POLITICAL POINTS
By the time the N.S.W. Labor caucus
met on Wednesday to elect a new leader
the struggle for the job was already
over and R. J. Heffron, who had stepped
up to the Premiership on the death of
J. J. Cahill, was elected unopposed. The
Deputy Premiership wasn’t such a
simple matter; J. B. Renshaw beat
W. F. Sheahan by only one vote.
The ballot to fill the Cabinet vacancy
was won by N. J. Mannix, M.L.A. for
Liverpool, the Right-wing nominee.
Heffron has made only a few changes
in the portfolios of his team. He is
retaining his Education portfolio and
has passed the Treasury over to Ren-
shaw. P. D. Hills succeeds Renshaw as
Minister for Local Government and
Highways ; in the Cahill Cabinet he was
Minister Assisting the Premier and
Treasurer.

It had been tipped that Billy Sheahan
would get his way and that one of the
legal portfolios would be brought back
to the Lower House. However, nothing
was done, and Reg Downing, M.L.C.,
will continue as Attorney-General and
Minister for Justice. In Sheahan’s
present mood this arrangement isn’t
likely to last long. Billy has had to
answer all the curly questions which
come up in the Assembly affecting
Downing’s departments—and there are
plenty. Possible solutions are: —(1)
Make Sheahan Attorney-General; (2)
Give the job to Landa or Mannix, or
depute one of these to represent Down-
ing in the Assembly ; (3) Bring Downing
into the Assembly via Cook’s River.

There’s a lot of dirty linen in Can-
berra at present. And Eddie Ward has
had nothing to do with it. The floods
have shown-up the deficiencies of the
A.C.T. water-supply, and from the taps
there exudes a flow of mud lightly
diluted with water. It is the done thing
in Canberra now, even in diplomatic
quarters, to drink your whisky with soda
—or even ginger-ale—rather than with
the water of Scottish tradition.

Both Sydney’s afternoon papers
claimed a scoop over the Russian moon-
pictures, cheerfully ignoring the fact that
the same photos were appearing in hun-
dreds of papers all round the globe. But
they made amends in their postering of
the Long Bay escapes. When, with
Newcombe recaptured and Simmonds
still at large, two women prisoners also
flit the coop, the “Daily Mirror” com-
mented, “Long Bay Score—OUT Three,”
and the Sun capped it with “Ladies’ Day
at Long Bay.”

Latest guess at the name of the next
Governor-General is R. G. Casey, but
the P.M. says that none of the sugges-

remotely true.” In that case the new
man must be a rank outsider. Almost the
only public figures not suggested are
Chiang Kai-shek, Dan Curtin and
Sabrina.

appointed a committee of five to
“examine the financial relationship be-
tween the Post Office and the Treasury.”
The committee will be headed by Sir
Alexander Fitzgerald. It will have as
one of its chief objects the consideration
of funds transferred from consolidated
revenue for P.O. capital-works and “the
amount, basis or rate of any yearly con-
tribution which the Post Office might be
asked to make to the Treasury.” As
indicated in B. 28/10/’59, the Govern-
ment appears to have already made up
its mind on this matter. Whatever
accounting merit there may seem to be
in charging users of the Post Office with
interest on capital-works financed out of
revenue, the practice will, in the broader
economic sense, add to inflation and take
further value out of the pound—though,
of course, adding to the funds handled
by the Treasury.

Goldbloom, the secretary of the Mel-
bourne “Peace” Congress, on hearing
that Professors Stout and Oliphant had
withdrawn their sponsorship, said there
would still be the widest possible represen-
tation, including the Churches. As the
Church of England and the Roman
Catholic Church, the two largest
denominations, have condemned the
show, the “widest possible” seems likely
to be rather narrow'.

A Western “summit” meeting will open
in Paris on December 19 with Eisen-
hower, Macmillan, de Gaulle and
Adenauer attending. Subject: “A first
study of questions that might be dis-
cussed with the Premier of the Soviet
Union.” This seems to indicate that the
meeting with Khrushchev won’t be held
until well into the new year, possibly in
March, as advocated by de Gaulle.

“Third time lucky!"


Queensland is forming emergency
rescue-squads in 34 cities and towns;
they’ll go into action in time of fire,
floods, cyclones and explosions, and will

civil-defence force.

Prime Minister Macmillan told the
Commons last week that a few months
ago there had been “a frank and open
difference of view” between Eisenhower
and himself, the President having held
that some further progress ought to be
made in discussion with Soviet leaders
before the Summit could be useful. The
Foreign Ministers’ talks had helped a
little, but not enough. Macmillan said
he had hoped Khrushchev’s visit to
Eisenhower would bring results, and when
he heard that the President felt he had
made enough progress with the Soviet
Premier to justify the Summit meeting
he had believed the last obstacle had
been removed.
Macmillan declined to discuss the
present state of negotiations, but said
the important thing was to “keep up the
momentum.” The United Kingdom, he
said, still wanted the meeting at the
earliest possible date, but although all
parties wanted to see a reduction of
tension, this could not be done by aban-
doning the alliances on which the free-
dom of the world depended. “The role
of Great Britain is not to lead a retreat,
but to use her influence for an honorable
accommodation.”

Two U.S. satellites, Discoverer VI and

After “Scotland” defeated “Italy” in
the “Laidlaw World Cup” at Soccer in
Melbourne, some of their supporters
clashed in the centre of the ground, and
Police Commissioner Porter suggested it
was time national titles on teams were
ended. (Porter is himself patron of the
Juventus team, which began as all-
Italian but now includes several
nationalities, among them a Spaniard and
two Englishmen.) The gate must always
be considered. Would the Highlanders

Charges of political prejudice have
been levelled at the historical sketch of
Queensland, Triumph in the Tropics,
compiled by Sir Raphael Cilento and
Clem Lack, snr. Former Attorney-
General Power raised the cry in the
Assembly over the omission of Gair’s
signature from the inside of the cover,
where those of several other former
Premiers are reproduced under the head-
ing : “Their names are written on
Queensland’s history.” Power pointed
out that Gair was the only Premier
since. 1925 whose signature did not
appear, claimed this was an insult to a
man who “sacrificed the Premiership in
defence of the democratic Parliamentary
system.”

• “Stromlo”: While churchmen and
others argue over the moral aspects of
birth-control, scientists are concerned
with the effects on populations. Sir
Macfarlane Burnet told a Hobart
audience that birth-control was the
world’s only hope survival unless
there was a huge population-reduction
by famine or war, neither of which
seemed satisfactory alternatives. He
said that if the current rate of increase
was maintained there would be 6700-
million people by a.d. 2000 (compared
with 2950 million now) and 420,000
million by a.d. 2200. The irreplaceable
resources of a small planet, said Burnet,
could not continue to supply such a
population. Of course, by that time Mars
may be one of the suburbs.

Queensland Premier Nicklin has re-
fused any action to establish new States
before or at next year’s election, has
told New Staters that precipitate action
could endanger their movement. He says
Government policy favors creation of

economics will allow it. Central Queens-
land, he says, is not yet economically
strong enough. North Queensland de-
velopment, however, will soon make it

“Ex-ACT”: One of the five reasons
given by the Grants Commission why
Tasmania warranted special financial aid
was “the substantial fall in lottery-
revenue.” This will be of more general
interest to lottery-“investors,” who sel-

than the other reasons, which included
“the relatively poor resources of the
State,” the high proportion of school-
children, the relatively low level of in-
come, and “difficult terrain and climate.”

Suggestions that parents be arraigned
in court with their delinquent children
and adequate punishment meted out to
those contributing to the delinquency
of a minor were two of the main recom-
mendations by Queensland’s Parliamen-
tary Committee on Youth Problems. The
seven-member committee heard 106
witnesses before compiling its 21-page re-
port, but broke no new ground by finding
inadequate parental guidance the main
cause of youth-problems. Other recom-
mendations of the committee: Exten-
sion of school-leaving age to 15 by
1962 ; a ban on children in beer-gardens,
at least after 6 p.m.; a panel of psycho-
logically-trained experts to preside over
Children’s Courts; and a Children’s
Court Clinic to which youngsters guilty
of anti-social behavior could be com-
mitted by police.
The committee noted that Queens-
land’s confirmed delinquents were con-
centrated principally in Brisbane, warned
that comparatively small, dangerously
unruly delinquent groups must be curbed.

In the no-holds-barred match between

Last week two important events hap-
pened in the Sydney Diocese: Arch-
bishop Hugh Rowlands Gough was
elected Anglican Primate of Australia
in succession to the late Archbishop
Mowll, and Bishop W. G. Hilliard,
Registrar and Senior Bishop-Coadjutor
of the Diocese, celebrated the silver-
jubilee of his consecration. Dr. Hilliard
was consecrated Bishop of Nelson (N.Z.)
in 1934 and returned to Sydney in 1940
to become a Bishop-Coadjutor and
Rector of St. John’s Church, Parramatta.
He's been Registrar since 1949.

Up to the moment he retired John
Benjamin Oswald Hosking had been
working so hard he hadn't time to think
what he'd do with leisure (so, anyway,
he blandly told The Bulletin). He
certainly has been busy during his long
life. He won his education by scholar-
ships from a State school to the former
South Melbourne College and to Mel-
bourne University (Bachelor of Science
and Master of Civil Engineering). After
service in France with the 15th Field
Co. he became assistant - astronomer in
South Australia and later physicist at
the old Melbourne Observatory; then
he joined the Harbor Trust, ascending
to the top engineering post as long ago
as 1936.
He found astronomy absorbing, but
he could do no more than read about
the latest developments for the last 23
years. No time, of course.

Research Field Unit, learning about
such things as scrub-typhus.
He became acting Director of Public
Health in Papua and New Guinea in 1946
and the post was confirmed a year later.
During the next 10 years he built-up the
health-services throughout the territory
by hard work and imagination. He’s
brought the same virtues to his present

Arthur C. Cawley, newly-imported
Professor of English at Queensland
University, holds strong views on Aus-

was senior English lecturer at Leeds
University before being appointed to the
Queensland Chair, which has been
vacant since April, 1957. On arrival in
Brisbane he told of rapidly - growing
British interest in Australian writing and
suggested greater interchange of British
and Australian university-staff, stressing
that the academic world is international.
Professor Cawley has an impressive
academic record—B.A. with English
honors from London University College
in 1934, M.A. with distinction in 1938,
Ph.D. from London University, 1953.

Professor John Bishop, whose love of
music as a country boy has since taken
him round the world and landed him in
the post of director of Adelaide's Elder
Conservatorium of Music, is artistic-
director and chairman of the music-and-
drama committee of the Adelaide
Festival of Arts.
Now 56, Bishop was born at the old
South Coast village of Aldinga (S.A.) —
rich in lore of windjammer shipwrecks
and noted today as the home-hamlet of
artist Ivor Hele. Here Bishop banged
the piano as a boy until people took
notice. Then at 12 he won the William
Silver Open Scholarship, and two years
later went with Silver (his teacher) on
a tour of Europe and America. From
then the laurefs came steadily.
“Festivals cause us to rejoice,” says
the round-faced, silver-haired professor.
“1 remember the festivals of my boy-
hood at Aldinga . . . and the impact
they had. Then there were Sunday-
school festivals, the thousand-voice
choir, and so forth.” He puts precept
into practice and promotes music-
festivals as often as possible.

John Erskine Starke, the Victorian
Q.C. who has been plying the questions

the High Court), was a barrister in
Victoria when he married Margaret
Cavan Duffy, who had a considerable
amount of legal blood in her veins. John
Starke enlisted as a gunner in War 11,

“Geelong”: Victorian pressmen of an
earlier vintage, and other Melburnians
also, will remember Francis Joseph
O'Halloran, who has passed on at 83.
He spent his youth in Bendigo, had his
early training on the gold-town’s “Adver-
tiser,” and during the railway-strike
before the turn of the century used to
start his day’s work by riding round on
his bike to Marong, Leichardt, Derby,


Budgewater and Inglewood two to three
days a week delivering the paper before
presenting himself on time for his usual
office-duties. Subsequently he was for
over 50 years advertising-rep. of various
country newspapers, being the first Mel-
bourne rep. of the provincial press and
also representing various religious papers,
notably the “Catholic Advocate” and
“Tribune.” Francis Joseph O’Halloran
thought he owned Collins Street, and
was known to many parking-officers as
“Dennis the Menace.” He maintained
his prowess as a cyclist and became a
prominent amateur rider ; he was also
a coursing enthusiast (Plumpton and
Open).

Guest-star of the current Shakspeare
season at Sydney Royal is John Laurie,
and at the party thrown by the Firm
to launch the season caricaturist Lahm
couldn’t help capturing much of the
actor’s animation, for he just didn’t stop
animating. A dynamo of energy and
personality, he’s a conversationalist
whose bubbling humor gives no clue to
his passion for serious poetry —his re-
corded readings from Shakspeare,
Chaucer and Burns are famous. His
Shakspearian repertoire ranges over 87
roles, and only “Cymbeline” and
“Pericles” have remained outside his
orbit. Also, he has knocked-up over the
century in films, the list including
appearances in Olivier’s “Hamlet,’.’
“Henry V” and “Richard III.”
The 62-year-young Scot is a Lowlander
—born just over the border, within
bagpipe-wail of where the legendary
Annie Laurie (no relation) reputedly had
her being; and when he isn’t tearing
around the universe he resides near
where Milton wrote Paradise Lost, at
which address he presides over a wholly
female assemblage: wife, daughter,
mare, four bitches and a gaggle of hens
—and bears the strain remarkably well.

ABORIGINALITIES
TI/'hen we decided to get rid of our
TT dairy-herd I provided a couple of
kegs and a dozen of Scotch to wash
down the tubfuls of sandwiches and
cakes. The family mustered the cattle
on sale-day before tapping a keg to
make sure the brew was palatable.
Buyers (a few in cars, but most in carts,
buggies and on horseback) had inspected
the offerings and sampled the refresh-
ments before the auctioneer mounted his
rostrum in the corner of the milking-
yard, ran through .the usual preamble
and got down to business. It was good
business, too, for the buyers, gravitating
between keg and auctioneer, kept the
bidding spirited. One cocky, after each
fall of the hammer, would scoot the
25yds. to the booth and be back to the
ring in time to put the bidding up
another pound or two while still behind
the crowd, and. then push through to
inspect the cow being auctioned. He
bought a good many, some before he
had even seen them, and finished
hilariously riding the last two or three
round the sale-ring. It was a grand day
for all concerned; we fortunately ran
out of cows before beer, and the last
of the guests —as they were by then —
departed happily by moonlight. What’s
more, the auctioneer’s job was made
easy, all buyers afterwards declared
themselves well satisfied, and so was I.
The way sales are conducted nowadays
you’d think money was involved!

“Dicky”: When it comes to precision-
flying, the blue-wren is as good as any.
Our garden is surrounded with lin. wire-
netting, and the gay little blokes, with
perfect timing, go through it at top speed,
wings retracted at the vital split-second.

“H.J.W.:” On a patrol in Dutch New
Guinea one of our native carriers was
bitten on the ankle by a snake. After our
medical-orderly had given the usual
treatment —ligatures and cutting of
wound—another native dropped to the
ground and commenced his remedy by
spitting and blowing on the wound, which
he kept up for fully 10 minutes. Then,
“First time I’ve seen a dog with a guide-man!"
taking a coconut-sheli of water which
had half a mussel-shell in it, he hacked
at the wound with the “sterilised” mussel-
shell until it bled profusely. More spit-
ting and blowing. Then more cuts: six
up the inside of the leg to the top liga-
ture, another six down, resulting in gore
galore. Whether it was this or the white-
man treatment did the trick we’ll never
know. But the victim was able to take
up his load next morning with no show
of discomfort.

“Scotty”: Had always supposed that
referring to farmers as cockies was purely

Stone.”

“Kesem”: Bowen (N.Q.) is beginning
its centenary celebrations, which will
continue for 18 months —the port was
discovered in 1859 and the town dates
from 1861. Bowen, however, lost in
the race for progress against Towns-
ville, which displaced it as a port (its
Port Denison, though, can lick Towns-
ville's mostly man-made harbor for
beauty and fishing-facilities). There was
a half-waking to life in Bowen town
and port in the first years of this century,
when a bismuth-mine was opened at
Ukalunda, 120 miles south-west. At first
it held great promise, but shortage of
water, transport difficulties —two ranges
had to be crossed —and the collapse of
the metal-market settled its hash. Only
for its mangoes, its tomatoes and the
cattle-industry in its hinterland Bowen
would have died altogether. The search
still goes on spasmodically for gold near
Ukalunda in an underground-river area
supposed by some old-time prospectors
to be as rich as Charters Towers or Mt.

number of the survivors were driven
south, past a long coast. Cheng reached
Ceylon and returned to China, and many
years later a porcelain map, almost cer-
tainly of this continent, was presented
to the Emperor Yeng Tsung. The in-
ference is that part of the fleet circum-
navigated Australia, keeping fairly close
to the coast, that porcelain map being
the best one of this part of the world
in existence long after the name New
Holland was in general use. There are
also records of the Japanese pirate
Yamada Nagamasa, who robbed Spanish
ships taking gold to the Philippines, and
who, around 1630, was operating from
the Philippines to Java, Borneo, New
Guinea and a land the Japs called Seiyo.

“K.R.’ : Goulburn (N.S.W.), which
once boasted and it was a boast —
having 70 hotels, now has but the devil's
own number of hostelries dispensing
what the uninformed may consider the
devil’s own brew. Amidst the inevitable
Royal, Grand, Empire and so on stands
the Alcestan. I’m told by an Oldest
Inhabitant that this hotel, in Oirish
hands for many a year, was once the
Harp. A new owner, untouched and
unmoved by the Blarney Stone, coined
its present name (pronounced with the
accent on the middle syllable) from the
names of his three sons, Alan, Cecil and
Stanley.
Tt is pleasing to note that the frontiers
of scientific experiment can be
pushed underwater as well as into outer-
space. I refer to the work of Professor
Gunther Borg, a Swedish biologist who
has made an intensive study of the rela-
tionship between voice and body, and,
convinced that fish share with humans
the gift of speech, has been lowering
microphones into the sea to try to
record on tape the conversation of our
finny friends. Having never had the
pleasure of hearing a flathead (except
a human one) express an opinion on
matters of moment, or a sardine tell-off
another, or a gaggle of female mullet
having a session over the morning
burley, I am agog to discover if
piscatorial parley is recognisable. But
should the pleasure of discovery be all
one-sided? What a wonderful thing it
would be if some walking-fish from
Queensland could stroll into a cocktail-
party or a pub-bar between 5 p.m. and
6.30 p.m. and make a record of human
conversation! If the snapper and
jewies and toadfish couldn't get a good
belly-laugh when it was played-back to
them, then there’s something wrong
with ’em. —“Bo.”

“Crow Eater”: The old Murray
paddle-steamer Avoca, which I last saw
two or three years ago as a showboat
doing tourist-trips from Mildura, has
been converted from wood-burning
steam-power to diesel-electric for its
paddle-propulsion. The picturesque craft
is operated by father and son, E. W.
and G. Doecke, who believe she is the
only diesel-electric paddle-boat in the
world. Romantically - minded trippers
will miss the billowing smoke-plumes
which helped to conjure up pictures of
the days when the paddle-boat fleet
travelled the river. A couple of them are
still at Goolwa, I fancy, one doing duty
on barrage-work and the other as a
houseboat.

“Bruin”: Gold Coast City Council is
planning to ask subdividers around
Burleigh Heads (Q.) to preserve food-
trees for a colony of about 100 koalas in
the area. The Queensland Agriculture
Department had told the council it might
be necessary to remove the koalas be-
cause trees were being destroyed to make
way for houses.

“Alma”: Surprised that “Lillydale’s”
emus (B. 7 /10/’59) wouldn’t co-operate
for their photos. The most curious of
birds, they can usually be enticed within
close range by antics. As kids at Booligal
(N.S.W.) we used to bring them up for
city visitors to get a close look, our
favorite method being to lie down and
kick our legs above the saltbush. Waving
a handkerchief or tooting a car-horn
would also bring them running to in-
vestigate. Same result if we halted our
horses when out mustering and waved
a hat for a few minutes. But a word of
warning if the photographer is mounted
and engrossed in his work: a curious
emu isn't above a swift peck or even a
kick at a prad or rider.

“F.G.”: Heard in a quiz that a
“hogget” is a yearling sheep, and nothing
to do with swine. Confirmed this by the
Oxford Dictionary, and turning to “hog”
found that, though used generally for
“pig” by pig-farmers, the term corres-
ponds to “bullock” in cattle, and is
applied especially to the animals reared
for slaughter. Surprised to find, further,
that in some places, in dialect, a “hog” is
a sheep before first shearing. Therefore
a hogget is also a hog.
• * * *
“Blower”: In reply to “Joel” (B.
23/9/’59): It's many years since salt was
sold in jars. In the days before salt-
shakers, salt being so lumpy, an English
firm packed salt in bottles and jars and
sent it to Australia. This idea was copied
here, but didn’t last long. My mother
bottled her own salt—mix ordinary salt
(a pound) with cornflour. The Standard
Salt Co. of S.A. worked at Edithburg,
Yorke Peninsula, which still produces
the finest domestic salt in the world.
The jars came mostly from England and
Germany. Fifty years ago a lot of people
used the name “Royal Standard,”
embossed with the harp, thistle and lion.
I’ve seen a pub, milk-oh, baker and also
a travelling-draper using the same name
and the “coat-of-arms.” But of recent
years the name “Royal Standard” seems
to have vanished.

CHARTERS TOWERS GOLDFIELD
[From “Towersite”)
/Charters Towers (Q.) gold-
field is again attracting
interest in substantial quarters.
Dominions Pty., Ltd., for
some months has held a
prospecting concession-area of
450 square-miles (15 miles e.-w.
by 30 miles n.-s.) on the south-
west of the main goldfield area
extending from the Black Jack
towards Mt. Leyshon. Reports
suggest that not much has been
done, as yet, in the field, but
such operations need time to
get under way.
Recently a Broken Hill
operating-company (believed to
be the North) has taken
another gold-prospecting con-
cession-area of 850 square-
miles (22 miles n.-s. by 42
miles e.-w., less an area of
74 sq.-miles) extending from
the eastern side of the
Dominion concession over the
Towers main reefing-area
easterly to P.avenswood.
Towards the end of the last
century Government geologists
Jack, Rand and others reported
on and mapped the Towers
goldfield area and reefs of the
early days, the former men-
tioning that, with the strikes
and dips of the then known
reefs, if they lived in depth,
there could be a central area
of much promise.
In 1913, when mining was
being conducted under greater
difficulties because of small
lease-areas warranting only
small-capacity deep shafts, with
increasing water burdens on
the cos. continuing, veteran
goldfielder Tom Mills, of Mills
United (a leading producer to
1916 of over half-a-million
tons of ore for well over half-
a-million ounces of gold) pro-
posed a lease of such size as to
warrant sinking a large central
deep shaft in the town-park
area to 4000 ft. on a subsidy of
£60,000 from the Government.
Government geologist J. H.
Reid started an investigation
of the project, but the out-
break of World War I and
staff enlistments delayed com-
pletion of the report, which
wasn’t published until 1917.
The proposal had been rejected
earlier.
Production from the field to
the end of 1877 was given as
493,558 fine oz. (no tonnage),
and from 1878 to 1916, both
inclusive, 5,543,518 tons of or®
“Have they found out which prisoners running
the moneylender-business yet ?”
yielded 6,097,924 fine oz. gold,
or 22dwt. per ton.
Chlorination-works came
into operation in the early days
of the field. The chimney-stack
on Towers Hill was a familiar
landmark until demolished
about 1942 for military reasons.
In 1897, A. Sellars and Sons
erected the first cyanide-works
at Millchester and started a
cyaniding boom which, coupled
with the buying of concentrates
by southern smelters, put the
chlorination-works out of
action at the end of the century.
Iron-pyrites, galena and
zincblende were the principal
minerals, averaging about 7
p.c. of the ore treated. An
increase in the pyrite content,
particularly of galena, was
usually accompanied by an
increase in gold content, but
local reports indicate some
sulphide orebodies with low
gold-content being left as un-
payable owing to the difficulties
and cost of treatment.
Modern differential flotation
could put another aspect on
such ore, and, probably, on the
treatment of all the ores of
the field.
This valuable, detailed report
[Reid] indicates a decrease of
values in depth of the ores
as mined, but there are a lot of
qualifying factors, such as
hand-steel mining being more
selective than machine-mining,
improved mining and treatment
methods made lower-grade ore
payable, and so on.
Whether so or not, the
figures quoted for depths from
2000ft.-3000ft. [viz., Mills
United (2360 ft.), Day Dawn
Reef, 0.870 z. crude gold per
ton, average grade, and Brilliant
Extended (2900 ft.), Brilliant
Reef, 0.550 z. per ton of ore
average] present challenges for
testing in view of the advances
in mining and metallurgy.
The Royal Commission on
Mining (Q.) 1930, favored the
deep-shaft proposal, and an
official report by Mines In-
spector Laun was made of the
Brilliant Deeps to have a
level having 3ft. of loz. to 2oz.
stone left, and the expensive
Brilliant Deeps to have a
similar body of ounce ore. The
Brilliant Extended No. 3
underlie shaft (3045 ft.) was
recorded as the deepest gold-
mine working in Queensland.
About 1934, Gold Mines of
Australia made a summary of
the possibilities, also of nearby
Ravenswood, but was attracted
elsewhere, though credited with
the idea of returning later.
The tailings-heaps remain-
ing (then held by S. N.
Williams, mining engineer)
were later tested by another
company, but nothing eventu-
ated. In Westralia, during
War 11, one large company
retreated its tailings for gold,
and recovered, as a war effort,
the minor scheelite content.
From 1916 the ’Towers gold
output steadily dwindled,
despite the efforts of stalwarts
such as the late Billy Clark,
Morgan Lewis (Clark’s Day
Dawn and later Black Jack)
and others, which gave an
annual average output of
6600 oz. for the 12 years
1938-1949 ; as against, for the
first three months of this year,
163 tons ore treated for 68oz.
fine mill gold and 70oz. fine
from other sources.
The old field now appears to
be in good hands, which, with
suitable encouragement, may
re-establish it as a gold-
producer of note —a substantial
Queensland Centenary effort —
more feasible as gold is gain-
ing increased support and use
for currency and trade.
India’s Economic Problems
Tn his three Dyason Memorial
Lectures (“The Economic
Take-off in a Free Society”),
Dr. V. K. R. V. Rao, a dis-
tinguished Indian economist,
presented a vivid picture of
India’s economic problems.
The main difficulty, he said,
was to achieve an adequate
rate of savings and investment
from a national income of
about £25 a head, without
abandoning, or curtailing,
political democracy:
“The most important thing
to notice about India's attempt
at economic development is
the political setting under
which taking place....ln
November, 1949, India be-
came a full-fledged and operat-
ing democracy in the Aus-
tralian sense of the term....
and has already had two
general elections.

peculiarly strong place: the
number of members of regis-
tered trade-unions is 2\
millions and their political
influence is considerable....
“We have in India some of
the most advanced labor-legis-
lation in the world. Hours of
work are limited to 48 hours
a week for adults and there
are severe limitations on the
employment of women and
children.... Minimum wages
are prescribed for specified
industries, including agricul-
ture, and compensation is pro-
vided to all workers in the
event of their lay-off or
retrenchment....
“While thus the common
man in India is in possession
of the democratic freedoms
that the common man in
modern democratic societies
attained only after the break-
through from stagnation to
development had taken place,
the economic condition of the
country is such that it still has
to achieve this economic take-
off.... And this has to be
done very quickly, in a couple
of decades, as population is
increasing at the rate of 1.8
p.c. a year and economic
development is becoming a
matter of a race against time.
“With the help of the
Planning Commission, the
Government has set up a
target of doubling the national
income in about 18 years, ?.nd
of per capita income in about
24 years. This has involved a
big programme of public invest-
ment, especially in respect of
the economic overheads such as
irrigation, power, transport and
fuel. It has also involved a pro-
gramme of industrialisation,
especially in iron and steel,
cement, chemicals, and engi-
neering.
“Simultaneously, encourage-
ment has also to be given to
private investment, the total
outlay envisaged on investment,
both public and private, in
about 25 years is of the order
of about £A54,000 million ; it is
almost certain now... .that this
may have to be raised by
another 10 or 20 p.c. It also
means trebling of the rate of
saving from about 5 p.c. in
1950 to about 17 p.c. in 1975.
The bulk of investment... .has
to come from the masses.”
“The first two five-year
plans (ending March, 1961)
involve investment of about
£A8,500 million, of which in-
vestment in the public sector
would be about £A4900
million.”
In addition £AI3OO million
has to be spent on social-
services during this period:
“The disquieting feature is
not only that more than 20
p.c. of the finance has to come
from abroad and that nearly
30 p.c. has to come through
inflation, but also the fact that
the share of these two not
wholly desirable components is
much higher in the second
plan than in the first plan.
“Self-reliance, if you will,
self-exploitation, is as much
the foundation of national
economic development as it is
of individual economic better-
ment.... If the masses are
not going to be coerced they
must be persuaded.
“Churchill could promise his
nation only ‘blood, sweat and
tears’ in the present and yet
rouse his people to heroic
deeds, not only of valor but
of hard and dull work, in
order that the English people
could preserve their political
freedom and the English way
of life. Something similar is
required if the Indian masses
are to be enthused.”
M.B.F. Pays Out Millions
T>enefits drawn by members
of the Medical Benefits
Fund of Australia rose by
£1,609,000 to £9,525,000 in the
financial year 1958-59, and the
13th annual report reveals that
more than one-third of medical
claims were settled in cash over
the counter. This feature of
fund service is being developed
further as staff are trained and
more premises become avail-
able. “Meanwhile all claims
are, on an average, settled
within a week,” says Sir
Ronald Grieve, president of the
fund.
The fund, a mutual non-
profit organisation, is registered
under the National Health Act
and operates in three States —
N.S.W., Queensland and Tas-
mania. Membership has
jumped another 300,000 and
now exceeds 2,800,000. In
Queensland and Tasmania,
over 730,000 members are also
eligible for hospital-benefits.
M.B.F. is a member of the
Blue Cross Association, which
is the co-ordinating body of the
major non-profit health-
insurance funds in the Com-
monwealth.
With assets exceeding
£2,600,000, of which £1,867,000
are liquid, the fund’s financial
position is considered sound.
In addition to handling Com-
monwealth claims (£3,803,809)
the fund paid £5,721,736 in
claims last year, from con-
tributions of £6,783,704.
Administrative costs
(£859,305) were kept down to
12| p.c. of income. Of the
£267,685 surplus, £102,300
went to the claims-reserve
which, at £2,427,300, repre-
sents 13s. 6d. per person
covered, as against 14s. Bd. the
previqus year.
In accepting the Govern-
ment’s invitation to open
Special Accounts, the fund,
for the first time, found it
necessary to call on its reserves.
“This temporary drain on
reserves coincided with the
influenza epidemic in the
autumn, and vindicated the
fund’s prudent action over the
years in establishing strong
reserves in the interest of con-
tributors.”
On January 1, 1959, the fund
opened Special Accounts for
both its medical- and hospital-
activities under the National
Health Act. The Common-
wealth Government under-
writes losses in the Special
Accounts and in return requires
funds to liberalise member-
ship conditions for the remain-
ing contributors. “This innova-
tion has been the means of
giving considerable assistance
to the chronically ill. However,
the council of the fund is of
the opinion that the chosen
methods are cumbersome and
wasteful and accordingly has
recommended alternatives to
the Government.”
Innamincka and Betoota
[From L. Owen]
T atest press-release about
' the Innamincka well states
that the depth was 12,223 ft. on
October 28 and that the drill
was still in red-brown shale
with intervals of calcareous
sand containing some gypsum.
This bed has persisted, without
appreciable break or change,
for a thickness of the order of
5000 ft.
A Santos resume of opera-
tions at Innamincka includes
the following:
The depth of the Innamincka
well is, at the date of this report
[l4/10/*s9], over 11,400 ft. It must
be realised that a prime purpose
of this first well, with a projected
depth of 14,000 ft., is to obtain
information concerning not only
the Innamincka structure, but also
of the Artesian Basin itself. It has
produced much new information

and supplied answers to questions
raised by the seismic survey. In
the first place, there has been proved
a thick sequence of sedimentary
deposits. There was a good seismic
reflective horizon at about 7000 ft.
It proved to be in Palieozoic sedi-
mentary formations (not in bed-
rock as was an alternative interpre-
tation before drilling commenced)
....In addition, there have been
numerous oil- and gas-showings in
the Lower Cretaceous and Permian.
It is the view of Santos geologists
that the evidence of hydrocarbons
being present indicates that there
are possibly significant accumula-
tions of oil somewhere in the
Innamincka structure.
It was not until a depth of
approximately 7000 ft. that the
drill passed through the Mesozoic
sediments. Drilling is proceeding
in rather monotonous shales
thpught to be Middle-Upper Palaeo-
zoic shales. A main interest is in
the Cambro-Ordovician sediments
which may underlie these shales —
as these sediments were shown by
earlier Santos operations to be oil-
bearing at Wilkatana and else-
where.
While these statements do
not throw light on the reasons
for the occurrence of the great
thickness of “rather mono-
tonous shales”—obviously un-
anticipated by the operating
group—they indicate that the
target for commercial
petroleum has, at long last,
shifted from the Cretaceous
to the Lower Palaeozoic. That
conception is in general accord-
ance with opinions expressed
in these pages over the past five
years.
Secondly, drilling at Inna-
mincka has revealed strati-
graphic conditions which could
have been forecast from the
results obtained from other
deep wells located on well-
defined post-Triassic “highs”
on the Australian mainland,
notably Cape Range No. 2 and
Rough Range No. 1.
At Innamincka, the 5000 ft.
of red shale is placed, rather in-
definitely, in the “Middle-
Upper Palaeozoic,” which can
cover a span of 500-million
years, and possibly more, and
would appear to have been laid
down under continental (and
largely aerobic) conditions. No
mention is made of the Trias,
and it is assumed, therefore,
that a hiatus occurs between
the Cretaceous and the Upper
Permian.
Two major breaks thus
occur in the Innamincka
sequence an upper break
cutting out the Trias and a
very serious dislocation which
extended from the Permian
down to (possibly) the “Cam-
bro-Ordovician,” during which
the tectonic conditions allowed
of the deposition of an
enormous thickness of con-
tinental strata. By reason of
these breaks, it is extremely im-
probable that any degree of
conformity exists between the
Cretaceous structure (on which
the well was located) and the
structure of the “Cambro-
Ordovician” from which it is
hoped to draw oil.
Betoota, likewise, has been
located at a point where sur-
veys indicate a large anticlinal
structure, presumably in post-
Trias beds, and is therefore
just as unlikely to penetrate, at
depth, a structure favorable to
the conservation of petroleum
in commercial quantities.
I have always been con-
vinced that such reservoirs of
oil exist under Australia ; the
hope of striking them, however,
will depend solely on chance
unless a drastic revision of the
exploratory technique satis-
factory in many oil regions, but
quite unsuited to Australian
geological history—is made.

There is a very puzzling
moment in “The Winter’s
Tale,” which John Alden has
gallantly put on at Sydney
Royal, and that is when Shaks-
peare, having given Hermione
a new daughter, talks about
“Eye, nose, lip, the trick of
his frown, his forehead.”
It wouldn’t really be surpris-
ing in this play if Shakspeare
had forgotten that the baby
was a girl, for there are other
moments of absentmindedness
—as when Hermione apparently
gets eight-months pregnant
overnight, and when Cleo-
menes and Dion are seen back
on the seashore of Sicily when
they ought to be banging at
the palace door—but actually
all that he means there is that
the child has its father’s frown
and forehead. But then, what
are we to make of the next
lines, where the daughter of
this ranting monster of
jealousy has “The pretty
dimples of his chin”? It really
is quite impossible to imagine
Leontes with a dimple. Was it
absentmindedness, or is it a
joke?
In this commentator’s
opinion it could only have been
a joke ; and it is one of those
moments like the time the
clown says that the bear has
“half din’d on the gentleman”
—which seem to indicate
either that Shakspeare, even at
the most solemn moments,
couldn’t help laughing at the
melodrama he was turning-out
for the mob, or else that the
whole play is meant to be
taken lightly, in a spirit of
burlesque.
It is, in fact, likely enough
that the whole of Paulina’s
scolding about the ill-treatment
of the queen and the baby is
meant to be funny ; and, if you
see him as a violent, passionate,
mad-headed Mediterranean
type, it might even be possible
"Does he belong to the Carpenters' Union?"
to get some fun out of the
jealous Leontes.
But however you take it —
and Alden has taken the melo-
drama with absolute serious-
ness the play must always
remain the craziest muddle,
and if one would have liked
to see a little more levity, any
production must rely in the
end on the very considerable
compensations which Shaks-
peare offers: what genuine
drama of jealousy, tragedy and
remorse may persist among
the melodrama ; the humor of
the rustics, who are as funny
as any under Bottom; the
charm of the women ; the rich-
ness of the one great character-
creation, Autoiycus ; the pas-
sages of superb poetry reach-
ing their peak in
.... daffodils
That come before the swallow dares,
and take
The winds of March with beauty:
violets dim,
But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s
eyes. . .
Alden lost much of the
drama of jealousy because,
playing jealous right from the
start, he deprived himself of
the few moments he has in
which to humanise himself as
genuinely friendly towards
Polixenes, and because Terry
McDermott, who never really
looked comfortable y in the
nightdresses he had to wear,
didn’t seem a possible lover for
Hermione —which, to make
any sense of the plot, he must.
But Alden was moving in the
scenes of remorse at the end ;
and Elaine Montgomerie, as
Hermione, was most tragic
and graceful all the way
through.
John Frawley played the
paternal rustic soundly enough,
but John Unicomb, as his son,
though amusing in his court-
dress, was much too grotesque
—there is no need to make
such types any" sillier, or any
more remote from us, than
Dad and Dave. John Laurie
played Autoiycus with a fine
flair and gusto. Mavis Turner
had charm enough as Perdita,
but lost the poetry.
So—it is a mixed play to
begin with, more mixed here,
but still with compensations
enough to make it, if not of
Old Vic or Stratford-on-Avon
quality, thoroughly enjoyable.
And three other compensations
should be mentioned: the
decorative sets ; the pleasure
one has in seeing the Alden
company promoted to the
Royal (with much sounder
plays to come); and the
particular interest there is in
seeing “The Winter’s Tale”
because it is so rarely per-
formed.

Bruckner’s Seventh
The storms of controversy
which once raged around the
symphonies of Anton Bruckner
have long since quietened into
zephyrs. The chief criticism
levelled at Bruckner in an age
inured to long-winded works is
that he sometimes tends to take
too long to say too much.
If that charge may be justi-
fied against some of his nine
symphonies it certainly cannot
be sustained against his Seventh
in E Major, and the perform-
ance of this work on Saturday
night by the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra under Nicolai Malko
brought out a very good
measure of its towering majesty.
The sweeping and powerful
development of the opening
movement was a challenge
which Malko met with purpose
and vigor to win dedicated
playing all round, with especi-
ally fine work by the lower
strings, oboes and clarinet. The
adagio —-which contains some
of the most splendid pages
Bruckner wrote —was wrought

by Malko and his forces into a
deeply moving threnody, a
beautifully eloquent tribute by
the composer to his dying
friend Wagner® In this the
cantilena- like singing of the
upper strings was notable.
The scherzo, for all its pre-
cision rhythms, lacks the in-
spiration of what has gone be-
fore. The composer failed to
find, even in two themes,
material above the mediocre ;
but the intervening trio—a little
gem—partly saves the move-
ment. Malko rode the storm of
the finale with near-abandon,
and he built the coda into an
exordium of grandeur, with the
brasses in weighty voice.
The suite “Cimerosiana” —
an arrangement by Malipiero
of some airs by Domenico
Cimerosa, the Italian con-
temporary of Mozart—was an
engaging and engagingly played
confection of sprightly, elegant
and unfailingly melodious
pieces which are in fact strongly
suggestive of Mozart at his
gayest.
The soloist of the evening
was the Russian-American
baritone Igor Gorin. With his
resonant and splendid baritone
working at its top, he moved
easily through the varying
moods of three widely different
arias. All the cynicism of lago
was there in the “Credo” from
“Otello. ” Here Verdi pushes
the baritone voice down to the
limit of its range, but Gorin
i n this region still managed
clear projection,
The “Drinking Song,” from
Thomas’s “Hamlet,” had the
needed brake on gaiety, a hint
that the Dane’s gloom and pur-
P°se were still just below the
surface of forced merriment,
“Vision Fugitive,” from Mas-
senet’s “Herodiade,” was an
essay in unalloyed desire, fully
indicative of the spell Salome
had cast upon the lusty King
Herod,

S.U.D.S. Triumph
The Sydney University
Dramatic Society’s arresting
production of “The Bald Prima
Donna”—an avant-garde one-
acter by Rumanian-French
playwright Eugene lonesco —
won three awards out of a
possible five in the finals of the
British Drama League’s com-
munity-drama competition at
the Wallace Theatre last Satur-
day night.
The awards, made by adjudi-
cator David Dawson after per-
formances by the three finalists,
were for the best production,
best actor and best actress.
Easily the most striking pro-
duction of the night, “The
Bald Prima Donna” almost
defies analysis. In it lonesco
simply takes an English
bourgeois couple and sets them
talking a sort of inspired non-
sense about the thundering
banality of their life. They are
visited by another couple who
don’t know each other, and by
a helmeted fireman seeking
business; and together with
the maid they tell polite and
pointless stories that turn
truth and reality upside-down,
launching soon into a shrill
quarrel made entirely of sense-
less and unrelated assertions.
This ends abruptly, and at the
end we are back at the open-
ing scene.
The overall result is a lunatic
image of the unreality of
bourgeois (if not of all) life,
the near-impossibility of com-
munication, the relativity ~of
truth, the . . . the reviewer is
only guessing.
lonesco, of course, is in
some ways like Samuel Beckett;
but on the evidence of his short
plays he is, although stimulat-
ing, by no means as profound.
One suspects that beneath his
work there lies nothing but
platitudes, accepted ideas and
half-truths. Nor does he trans-
late these into terms as
theatrically logical or wide-
ranging as Beckett’s. All the
same, he makes a heady flight

Pamela Trethowan’s award-
winning production had all the
assurance, simplicity and wit
that one has come to associate
with her work throughout the
past year. She is now unques-
tionably one of Sydney’s most
interesting non - commercial
producers.
Her. acute perceptions of the
lonesco play were realised ad-
mirably by her company as a
whole, and splendidly by Freda
Lesslie and Grahame McPher-
son, both of whom were clear
and memorable prizewinners.
Audrey Blaxland, of the
Pymble Players, won the award
for the best supporting player
for her sound likeness of the
hotel-owner in another finalist
play, “Drive a Hard Bargain,”
by Australian playwright Oriel
Grays This account of how a
drover’s love for a half-caste
barmaid in an outback pub
survives a temptation from the
world of city-slicker corrup-
tion, was judged to be the
better of the two Australian
plays entered in the competi-
tion.
The third finalist was the
Kooroora Players’ workman-
like production of “Playgoers,”
an Edwardian formula farce
by A. W. Pinero.
Margaret Liston won the
award for diction with a dialect
part in Garrick Productions’
account of “Mr. Sampson”;

tion of “Such Sweet Sorrow.”

Priestley Revival
One of the few lasting virtues
of J. B. Priestley’s “Time and
the Conways” is that young
or inexperienced actors and
producers can practise on it
without much risk of getting
into a mess.
There is no difficult cross-
weave in the action, which is
cut into three neat lengths, each
with its clear dominant mood.
Act I shows the Conways as
they happily are ; Act II shows
them as they unhappily will be
in 20 years’ time ; and Act 111
makes glib irony out of their
present imagining of future
happiness. The only real
difficulties seem to lie in dis-
guising the lack of dramatic
focus in Act I, and in making
the exposition of the time-
theory in Act II look as if it
belongs in the action and is
not simply a gimmick with
which Priestley has dressed a
to look like
a think-piece.
There are no awkward
shadings of character to
manage, either. The acts nicely
divide the change from youth-
ful gaiety to middle-aged
bitterness and back again and
the few slight shifts of mood
in each act are carefully blue-
printed by the playwright.
Such a piece could present
few difficulties to the person-
able and spirited young com-
pany that is currently playing
it at North Sydney Inde-
pendent.
Although the production, by
Keith Potten, was not imagi-
native enough to disguise the
play’s weaknesses and sharpen
its ironies, it went along
fairly smoothly after a little
early wavering, and provided
many moments of promise and
modest achievement from a
few of the players—notably
James Elliott, as the* ruthless
industrialist who wins the
prettiest Conway ; David Cal-
cott, as the quiet clerking son ;
Jeremy Muir-Smith, as the
legal friend of the family;
Janice Cook, as the writing
daughter who sees into the
future; and Joan Wilkinson,
as the Socialist schoolteacher.
Artbursts
Paintings—and a Pianist
When the present reviewer
arrived at Sydney’s carpeted
and comfortable Royal Com-
monwealth Society Gallery last
week to look at a two-day
show of oils and watercolors
someone out of sight in the
second room was struggling
through a Beethoven piano-
sonata. By the time the re-
viewer had gone around the
walls inspecting abstracts —
Roy Fluke had a nice “Dingo
Brush,” all line and subdued
color, and Sheila McDonald’s
“Winter” was controlled and
suitably frigid—the performer
had moved to Mozart; and
since there was little worth
looking at again, the reviewer
decided to invade the second
room, pianist notwithstanding.
The pianist turned out to be
a young lady, and near her
sat a young man with his eyes
closed. The man might have
been ecstatically responding to
the music, but then he might
simply have been shutting out
the paintings on the opposite
wall, most of which seemed
either pretty-pretty or plain
dull. lan McDonald’s “Timber
Yard, McMahon’s Point,”
while slight, was pleasant
enough; George Finey’s
largeish abstract oil “Falling
Leaves” showed leaves drip-
ping from a Klee tree; and
Gladys Tonkin had a reason-
ably fresh “Jetty, Palm
Beach.”

“The Scapegoat”
In this adaptation of the
Daphne Du Maurier novel,
Alec Guinness is the French-
language teacher at an English
university who, holidaying in
France, meets his exact double,
a debauched aristocrat, who
persuades him to take his place
for a time. He immediately
inherits a frigid wife, a most
unfrigid- mistress, a hate-
obsessed sister, a bedridden,
drug-taking matriarch (Bette
Davis) and a vast estate.
Having thus acquired for the
first time in years an interest in
life, he decides to stay on in
defiance of his double’s order
to quit, and so is able to solve
a murder. Although a cold
analysis of the plot reveals
more holes than in a borer-
struck bedpost, Guinness, with
uncanny skill, manages to make
it fairly persuasive, ringing
swift changes on the contrast-
ing characters with easy
authority.

“The 39 Steps”
Frank Harvey’s screenplay of
the first of John Buchan’s
Richard Hannay trilogy of
espionage - mysteries, whilst
giving the story a face-lift by
making guided-missile calcula-
tions the objective of the
enemy agents, in no way
weakens the plot’s structure
nor vitiates the original train of


tense and explosive situations.
It also supplies some attrac-
tively bantering humor to
season the thrills. The in-
gredients are mixed into a
highly-spiced dish by director
Ralph Thomas, who has added
outdoor scenery and color to
taste—and velocity.
Tensions may be slightly
weaker than in the earlier
Hitchcock version, but action
is packed tight. Kenneth More,
as the man who stumbles on a
mystery and sets out to un-
ravel it while trying to outwit
the pursuing enemy agents who
know that he knows, and the
police who are trying to pin a
murder-charge on him, invests
the role with rather more
gaiety and devil-may-careness
than Buchan wrote into the
character; but his perform-
ance is most engaging. Taina
Elg, as the girls’-college teacher
who gives Hannay aid and
comfort in tracking-down, the
spies over Scottish moors and
in London variety theatres, em-
bellishes the sets nicely.

BRADFORD COTTON MILLS, Limited
HEAD OFFICE:
“Bradinill House,” Car. Missenden and Parramatta Roads, Camperdown, N.S.W.
Speech of Mr. S. M. Wreford (Chairman) to Shareholders at the Thirty-second Annual
Meeting of Bradford Cotton Mills, Limited, held on Wednesday, 28th October, 1959,
at 12 noon .
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Printed copies of the Financial Statements and
the Directors’ Report relating to- them were sent
to Shareholders with the Notice of Meeting. They
deal in some detail with the results for the year,
and with your permission I propose to take them
as read.
GROUP RESULTS
The turnover for the year and the profit before
taxation, while lower than those for the previous
year, were achieved in a period of difficult trading
conditions, when the textile industry generally had
to face severe competition and an erratic market
demand. Having regard to all the circumstances
the aggregate income for the year (before pro-
vision for taxation), £867,131, must be considered
satisfactory.
It should be borne in mind that the sales and the
profit before tax in the year ended June, 1958, were
both all-time records and reflected additional
business, chiefly from Government Departments,
which was not repeated in the year under review.
In my Report to Shareholders last year, I said
that it was impossible to make a forecast as to
the future, appreciating that general economic
conditions would affect our operations. It is
pleasing to report that these conditions did not
cause any serious decline.
For the first three months of this year sales are
well ahead of the corresponding months of last
year.
PLANT DEVELOPMENT
Capital exependiture during the year, most of
which was on new plant, totalled £671,000. The
value of obsolete plant, either sold or scrapped,
was £32,000.' Fixed assets stand in the books at
£10,440,000 against which depreciation, amounting
to £4,245,000, has been provided.
During the year we maintained our policy of
replacing obsolescent plant and adding to existing
mills new plant of the latest design, to supplement
equipment already installed.
We have, for example, added to the spinning,
weaving and finishing plants in Victoria additional
units costing approximately £105,000. In N.S.W.
the completion of the at Kotara and
additional equipment for our Rutherford mills
cost approximately £291,000.
Additional modern dyeing and finishing equip-
ment has been installed in the Burlington Mill
to permit the processing of newer types of synthetic
yarns, while in the furnishing mill further looms
have been installed to broaden our range of
furnishing fabrics.
These are the more important items of capital
expenditure during the year and currently our
production is benefiting from this additional plant,
which is the latest and best of its kind.
TARIFFS
The types of fabric produced by your Company
are entering the country from overseas sources in
substantial quantities and this has been a contribu-
ting factor in the depressed state of the local
market.
This is particularly so in the case of the market
for rayon and other man-made fibre fabrics. The
severe competition experienced from these sources
necessitated some curtailment in the operations of
the rayon mill at Maitland, N.S.W.
Representations were made to the Government
to bring this situation under control and we have
been advised that the Tariff Board has been asked
to inquire into and report on the rates of duty
needed to protect the man-made fibre-weaving
industry which is an important segment of the
Australian Textile Industry.
In the period pending the inquiry by the Tariff
Board, imports of rayon and other man-made fibre
fabrics from Japan will be controlled according
to the provision of the Trade Agreement between
the two countries. This position is being closely
watched by your Company.
Much has been done to maintain our competitive
position in the market by improved methods and
increased productivity. In the long-term, security
for our employees and the continued progress of
the Company call for adequate duties so that Aus-
tralian-made goods may be marketed at prices com-
parable to imported textiles produced in low-cost
countries.
An important part of our activity is to obtain
adequate tariff protection and during the year we
appeared at various inquiries conducted by the
Commonwealth Tariff Board.
More recently we have submitted evidence to
the Tariff Board supporting the duties levied on
Canvas and Duck woven from man-made fibres.
These duties came under review as the result of
the proposal by the Government to reduce the
protection applying to textiles from countries
accorded Most Favoured Nation Treatment.
GENERAL
With our financial resources, plant, equipment
and technically trained staff, we consider that your
Company should be able to meet any reasonable
competitive conditions which may arise during
the year.
During the year a number of our technical staff
has visited the United Kingdom, U.S.A., the
Continent and Japan. At present our Managing
Director, Mr. R. J. Webster, is overseas on behalf
of the Company. These visits, together with our
close association with the leading manufacturers of
textiles in the United Kingdom and the United
States of America, enable the Company to keep
abreast with modern developments overseas. Your
Directors consider these visits and associations
materially contribute to the welfare of your
Company.
On behalf of my fellow Directors and myself I
wish to record appreciation of the important contri-
bution made to the success of the Company by the
Executive and Management staff and all other
personnel. The continued success of this Company
and its Subsidiaries is an indication of the loyal
assistance that has been 1
I am sure you will join with me and with your
Board in congratulating our Managing Director
(Mr. R. J. Webster, C.8.E., M.C.) on the further
honour of C.M.G. conferred on him by Her
Majesty the Queen.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I now have much
pleasure in formally moving the adoption of the
Report of the Directors and the Balance Sheet and
the Profit and Loss Account for the year ended
SOth June, 1959.

from £22,583 to £374,919. Last year
took the bun as the most impressive
chapter yet in this real-life sharemarket
thriller serial.
National Consolidated’s success is also
a convincing illustration of the rapid
strides made by the Australian economy,
and of the steadily rising living-standards
of the nation’s growing population. Only
in a rapidly developing country with a
high and improving standard of living
could such an enterprise as National
Consolidated consistently maintain a
rapid rate of growth.
Over the last two years National Con-
solidated (the name was changed from
National Radiators in 1959) expanded by
leaps and bounds. In 1958 Perry Bros.
Pty. and associated cos. were acquired by
the issue of 457,272 ss. ords. In the same
year freehold land was purchased in
Dandenong (Vic.), the vendor receiving
50,769 ords.
In 1959 came the big grabs—the
industrious and prosperous F. Muller
Pty. and subsidiaries were bought-out for
the consideration of 1,000,000 ords. After
balance-date the efficient Bearing Service
(Holdings), Ltd., was acquired for
4,598,284 ords., plus a cash payment
of £172,436.
The Jack-and-the-Beanstalk N.C. empire
now comprises four distinct but inte-
grated groups (National Radiators, Perry,
Muller and Bearing Service) controlling
in all 21 subsidiaries. A characteristic
feature of all N.C. take-overs has been
the preservation, as far as practicable, of
separate identities of the absorbed cos.
and their managements. At the same
time the leaders of absorbed firms have
been put on the N.C. board.
This farsighted policy paid handsome
dividends. Group-sales, with the impetus
given by co.-acquisitions and expansion,
nearly doubled during the year under
review, reaching £3,669,020 (£2,053,711
in 1958 and £1,186,714 in 1955).
After paying wages and salaries,
£1,037,196 (up £517,118), cost of
materials, £1,716,355 (up £676,697),
services, £228,939 (up £103,537), and
other expenses, and writing-off deprecia-
tion, £60,947 (up £24,551), the pre-tax
net profit on trading was £282,484 higher
at £611,799. Provision for taxation was
£107,619 higher at £236,880, leaving net
profit at £374,919 (up £174,865):

The tax provision seems slightly in
excess of ruling rates, but the complexity
of the co.’s operations makes an accurate
estimate difficult. After satisfying the
unchanged pref. - div. requirements
(£2500), the earning-rate on the average
ord. capital was 41.4 p.c., more than twice
the steady 20 p.c. ord.-div., absorbing
£180,053 on the increased capital. This
compares with 47.2, 22.5, 23.4 and 28.4
p.c. in the four preceding years.
Reserves received £192,366 and also
benefited by £4O profit on sale of assets
and £399,904 share premiums arising
from incorporation of subsidiaries. How-
ever, the reserve on consolidation, which
appeared in 1958, was written-off and
£299 had to be added to previous year’s
tax provision, leaving the reserves at
£960,068. Acquisition of subsidiaries left
another trace in the consolidated accounts
in the form of £107,194 intangibles.
In addition to share-issues made to
finance takeovers, N.C. made a l-for-2
bonus issue of 1,400,382 ss. ords. in
May, 1959, delighting its stock-owners
and effectively fencing-off any potential
takeover bids in the near future. Total
ord. share-issues during the year
amounted to £600,096, bringing the ord.
capital to £1,050,287 (plus £50,000

Bank accommodation was £17,977 higher
at £34,977, and creditors rose by £97,773
to £198,449. Freeholds and leaseholds
increased by £266,481 to £578,955, and
plant and machinery by £235,390 to
£558,234. This was subject to accumu-
lated depreciation write-offs of £233,395,
leaving the book-values of fixed assets at
£903,794 (up £461,230).
Holdings of shares in other cos.
increased by £181,436 to £186,186,
becoming a major item. Stocks gained
£453,690 at £875,901 and book-debts
£221,415 at £453,637. Cash was £67,658
higher at £206,008.
Current ratio dropped slightly, being
now 2.28:1 (2.47:1 in 1958 and 2.81:1
in 1957). Net tangible asset backing was
£4l 4s. 2d. (more than doubled) for 20s.
prefs. and 9s. 7d. for the ss. ords. Fixed
assets earning-rate was £4 Is. 2d. Over
50 p.c. of the earnings was retained in
the business.
Last week the ss. ords. looked a solid
buy at 265. 3d., yielding 3.8 p.c. The 20s.
prefs. fetched 28s. for a yield of 3.7 p.c.
Australian Blue Metal, Ltd.
npms quarrymaster and general con-
tractor of good standing has also
been successfully dabbling in automotive
distribution. The co. has an impressive
array of motor-agencies—Bentley-R.R.,
Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Foden, Renault
and Gardner (diesel agencies).
Its performance has been generally
good, although slips in the earnings
occurred in 1957 and 1958.
The co. has enjoyed remarkably strong


support by the share-market. Its 20s.
f.-p. ords. climbed from a very com-
fortable 565. to the dizzy heights of 695.
a unit (for a yield of 4.4 p.c.) during
the last six months or so. The con-
vertible notes brought 61s. 6d., offering
2.6 p.c. to conversion.
Satisfying as the published figures are,
this sustained investor-enthusiasm is an
intriguing bit of stock - market
psychology, difficult to justify on the
basis of available information.
The investors seem to have boundless
confidence in the dynamic qualities of
the scrip, driving the price higher and
higher. Possibly, this trust may be ulti-
mately rewarded by a bonus handout,
or a generous rights issue, from Aus-
tralian Blue Metal’s hitherto unrevealed
inner reserves.
Reasonable sales of blue-metal were
maintained throughout Australia,
although competition was keen,
especially in Perth and Sydney. On the
whole the year under review was a good
one, with turnover and profits increasing
appreciably. New plant installations and
modernised equipment began to show
results during the period, especially in
the eastern States. The aggregate trading
profit of the co. and its subsidiaries
[National Contractors Pty., Diesel
Motors (Sales) Pty. and Diesel Motors
Pty.] for the year ended June 30, 1959,
was £62,675 higher at £331,250, after
a. charge of £134,273 (up £19,578) for
depreciation of fixed assets. An amount
of £llB,OOO (up £31,000) was provided
for taxation.
The consolidated net profit increased
by £31,675 to £213,250, the highest level
yet reached:

This represents an earning-rate of 23.7
p.c. on average share-capital and com-
pares with 20.2 p.c., 25.4 p.c., 26.7 p.c.
and 29.3 p.c. looking back over four
years, 1958-1955.
The dividend was steady at 15 pc
absorbing £135,000. Another £6OOO
was paid on additional shares
issued in August, 1959, after the close
of accounts, but participating in the
dividend distribution for 1958-59. This
left £72,250 to be carried forward to
reserves, bringing them up to £565,653.
Early in the last term, Australian Blue
Metal issued 300,000 8 p.c. 20s. notes
(one for every three shares) at par,
convertible into ords. (one for one) in
October, 1963, and participating in any
cash- or bonus-issues before then. The
notes, appearing for the first time in the
balance-sheet on June 30, 1959, were
eagerly snapped-up. Paid-up capital was
unchanged (at £900,000) throughout the
financial year:

However, in August, 1959, a place-
ment of 40,000 20s. shares was made
through Sydney brokers at a premium
of £BB,OOO, which was credited in the
books to a new “share-premium-reserve
account.” The new shares participated
in the full dividend for the year ended
June 30, 1959 (the co. pays only one
dividend), and brought paid share-capital
to £940,000. The issue was made for the
specific purpose of acquiring an interest
in other private cos. in allied industries
and did not carry any special rights.
The consolidated balance-sheet reflects
the sound financial position of the co.
but gives few visible clues to its dynamic
development potential. The liquid posi-
tion appears to be better, with the
£119,687 overdraft wiped-out. Creditors
increased by £190,682 to £390,483 and
the tax provision was £38,903 higher at
£125,328.-
Freehold property, plant and motor-
vehicles increased during the year by
£134,201 to £1,351,457. After deducting
the £134,273 depreciation charge there
was a net increase in fixed assets of
£134,201 for the year.
Stock was £73,772 higher at £505,419.
Debtors increased by £93,603 to £378,207
and there was a cash balance of £187,381.
The current ratio worked out at 1.6 to 1
and net tangible asset-backing was a
shade under £1 12s. 7d. for a 20s. unit.
During the year the co. constructed
in its own workshops at Gosnells (W.A.)
a portable crushing-plant. Installation
of a new large primary section is now-
under way at the co.’s quarry at St.
Marys (N.S.W.), and should be com-
pleted during the current financial year.
Additional modern plant was bought
during the year to create greater
efficiency in the operation of country
contracts throughout the Commonwealth.
Recently the co. concluded arrange-
ments with Industrial Sales Holdings
(W.A.) Ltd. to acquire a 50 p.c. interest
in, Roadpavers, Ltd., which will cater
for the demand in the country districts
of Western Australia for hot bituminous
road-paving. A subsidiary co. has been
formed to supply ready-mixed concrete
in Perth.
Mount Morgan, Ltd.
'T'he co. was formed in 1929 to acquire
A Queensland assets of the old Mount
Morgan Gold Mining Co., Ltd., then in
a state of liquidation. The mine is
open-cut, producing gold and copper.
A considerable proportion of ore is
overburden, the removal of which is
a major expense-item.
The co. has a paid-up capital of
£2,400,000, made up of 2,800,000 10s.
stock-units and 2,000,000 10s. 7 p.c.
convertible redeemable prefs., all fully-
paid. The share-capital has remained
unchanged since 1952 when a bonus-
issue was made on the basis of three-for-
one. Following this, the 2s. 6d. shares
were consolidated into 10s. stock-units.
The only other capital-increase in the
past 22 years took place in 1948 (19-for-
-100, at 4s. 6d. premium on 2s. 6d.
shares).
The year ended June 28, 1959, brought
along a very substantial recovery in
earnings and divs., helped along by the
rallying copper prices. Production in all
departments was higher than in the pre-
ceding corresponding period. For the
first time in 25 years the production of
concentrates was continuous. There was
a considerable increase in the production
of metals in concentrates, and a corre-
sponding increase in the output of gold
and copper.
A record of 4,080,538 tons (up
1,372,410 tons, previous highest 3,795,352
tons) were mined, of which 826,341 tons
was delivered to the concentrating-mills.
During the year under review the
smelter produced 7933 tons (up 1072
tons) of blister, which contained 7857
tons of copper (up 1064 tons), 67,0850 z.
of gold (up 18,1950 z.) and 20,2850 z. of
silver (up 26000 z.). At the close of the
year the co. had stocks of 3783 tons
copper, 35,7080 z. gold arid 10,0200 z.
silver, shown at the book-value of
£1,068,004 (up £213,710).
The total revenue, as shown by the
Working Account, amounted to
£3,157,043 (up £540,513), against which
charges were £2,401,785 (up £219,032).
It should be noted that last year addi-
tional overburden had to be removed
at an extra cost of £166,628. The balance
carried to Profit and Loss Account was
£755,258 (up £321,481). After deducting
£310,827 expenses (including £76,000
general expenses and £200,000 deprecia-
tion) net profit was £187,583 higher at
£444,431. To this was added £3988
interest on investments.
After satisfying the steady pref.-divs.
requirements, the profit on ord. capital
was equivalent to an earning-rate of
27 p.c. compared with 13.6 p.c. in
1958 and 23.2, 34.7, 48.8 and 24 p.c.
in the preceding four years. The ord.
dividend went up to 20 p.c., absorbing
£280,000. (In 1958 only 10 p.c. was paid).
If things continue improving the ord.
divs. may reach the rate of 25 p.c. paid
in 1955.
There w'ere no significant changes in
the balance-sheet. Reserves and undis-
tributed profits totalled £3;841,628. A
total of £151,869 was spent on plant
and machinery during the year, bringing
the book-figure, after depreciation write-
offs, to £3,003,756 (up £151,869). Bank
accommodation increased by £110,483
to £132,708. Total assets amounted to
£7,043,686 (up £480,282).
The convertible prefs. are soon to be
converted into ords. at the pref.-share-
holders’ option. Prefs. not subject to
conversion will be replaced by redeem-
able pref. stock. At the last sale the
10s. prefs. sold for 14s. 2d. a unit. The
ords. were traded at 225. a 10s. unit,
yielding 9.1 p.c.

International Resistance
Holdings, Ltd.
TThe present holding co. was
A registered in Sydney in
1950. Scrip to the face-value of
£171,930 was exchanged for the
paid capital of International
Resistance (A/sia) Pty., Wm. J.
McKellar and Go. Pty.,
National Transformers Pty.
and Australasian Engineering
Equipment Pty. In 1951 the
share-capital of Conqueror
Cables Pty. was acquired for
£12,500 in shares and £12,500
cash.
Manufacturing' a wide range
of electrical components, Inter-
national Resistance has par-
ticipated fully in the TV-boom.
The co. produces such items as
resistors, transformers; chokes
and coils, capacitors, cables,
wires and wiring-devices used
for electrical, radio and TV,
automotive and general indus-
trial purposes. In addition, a
number of lucrative U.K. and
U.S. agencies are held, and a
close contact is kept-up with
the licensors, International
Resistance Co. of Philadelphia
(U.S.A.).
In April, 1959, the American
co. entered into an agreement
with the Chicago Telephone
Supply Corporation of Elkhart,
Ind. (U.S.A.). Under the
new arrangement International
Resistance (including the
Australian co.) will manufac-
ture the specialised C.T.S.
products on a licensing basis.
Another international agree-
ment concluded during the
year gives the co. access to the
engineering and technical ser-
vices, trade-marks and certain
patents of Elco Corpora-
tion of Philadelphia (U.S.A.).
International Resistance also
obtained a long-term exclusive
manufacturing licence to pro-
duce, in Australia, Elco’s
varicons, connectors, sockets
and other electronic com-
ponents. The agreement will
be implemented through Inter-
national Resistance’s new fully-
owned subsidiary, Elco (Aus-
tralasia) Pty., Ltd.
Concentrating on TV-com-
ponents, the co. has not
neglected other sections of the
electrical-engineering industry.
This policy of diversification
proved valuable recently when
the TV-boom showed signs of
levelling-off. The co.’s earn-
ings did not fall back below
the level of the previous term,
even though the rate of growth
of profits had, perhaps,
eased-up.
During the last year
seasonal effects in TV-produc-
tion were extended. Favorable
trading conditions were appa-
rent in the radio, sound-equip-
ment and appliance industries,
as well as in the electronic,
automotive and general indus-
trial fields served by the co.
During the year ended June
30, 1959, the group (compris-
ing the parent and its five
fully - owned subsidiaries)
earned a net profit of £253,954
(up £41,295):

The profit was struck after
providing £157,141 (up £17,741)
for taxation and £47,527 (up
£12,043) for depreciation. This
is equivalent to an earning-rate
of 42.7 p.c. on the average ord.
share-capital employed, after
deducting the steady pref.-div.
requirement (£7500). This
compares with 13 p.c. in 1956,
21.7 p.c. in 1957 and 39 p.c.
in 1958.
Ordinary div.-rate remained
steady at 12{ p.c., but the
cheque absorbed £8749 more
at £74,375 because of the
increase in ordinary capital
during the year.
Reserves received £172,079,
but were reduced by £3040

The rapid pace of expansion
has given shareholders in the
parent co. ample opportunity
to enlarge their holdings. The
one-for-two issue in 1951, one-
for-four in 1952, and one-for-
two in 1956 (all at par) raised
paid ord. capital from
£184,430 to £525,000 by 1958.
Last term the ord. capital was
further raised by £210,000 to
£735,000 by a two-for-five
issue at par in January, 1959.
Total paid capital of the group
at June 30 was £835,000:

International Resistance is
again increasing its ord. share-
capital by a one-for-four issue
of 735,000 ss. ords. at ss. a
unit premium—this is the
second rights issue in the
calendar year 1959. Books
closed on September 30, and
applications (accompanied by
the full amount of 10s. a share)
were to be in by October 26.
The new shares will rank for
divs. from July 1, 1959, and
will lift paid ord. capital to
£918,750.
The balance-sheet reflects
the co.'s strong capital struc-
ture. The sound financial posi-
tion was further strengthened by
a considerable improvement in
liquidity during the last term.
Notes remained unchanged at
£220,000, but borrowings on
mortgage increased by £15,494
to £123,926,
The overdraft (£48,112 in
1958) was wiped out and credi-
tors, etc., dropped by £32,261
to £315,666, in spite of the
increase in the tax provision
included in the item. Fixed
assets increased by £61,051 to
£707,897.
Trading-stocks went up by
£101,059 to £620,403, while
cash increased by £163,703 to
£169,053. Debtors decreased
slightly to £451,445.
On the consolidated figures
the current ratio was 3.4 to 1,
while the net tangible backing
worked out at £l2 9s. Bd. for
the prefs. and at £1 11s. 2d.
for the ords.
The share-issue currently
under way does not seem to
exhaust growth potentialities
of this co.’s scrip. The new
share-capital has already been
earmarked for the completion
of certain major projects. A
fresh appeal to shareholders
for funds is not unlikely,
although the time-interval may
be longer.
Of considerable significance
is the directors’ statement that
“assuming a continuance of
prevailing conditions” it is
expected to maintain ord. divs.
on the enlarged capital at
the current rate of 124- p.c.
This indicates that the co.
expects to improve on last
year’s satisfactory earning-
rates.
The share-market reaction
so far has been confident and
encouraging. At the last sale
the ss. ords. brought the seller
20s. 74d. a unit, yielding 3 p.c.
on the 12j p.c. div. basis.
The prefs. were last traded for
245., making the yield 6 p.c.
Bruce Pie Industries, Ltd.
T}rom its big knitting and
worsted-spinning mill at
Kedron (Q.) the co. supplies
customers throughout Aus-
tralia, though the home State
is its principal market. A
number of comparatively small
manufacturing-units produce
innerspring mattresses and
quilts, together with wire-
spring sections and padding,
etc., for use in the upholstery-
trade.
Bruce Pie Industries began
operations with a paid-up
capital of £300,000 (including
£59,073 scrip exchanged for
the shares of two existing con-
cerns). In 1949 another
£150,000 of scrip was issued at
par to pay for extensions to
the then newly built mill at
Kedron. A further one-for-
two par-issue was made in
1951, bringing the paid share-
capital to £675,000 (unchanged
since), all in 20s. ords.
On the whole the co. has
steadily, if modestly, increased
its earnings, with two setbacks.
In 1953 declining wool prices
and stiff competition from
imports caused profits to fall
by almost one-third. The div.-
rate was cut from 5 to 3 p.c.
Thereafter, the co. had a fair
run until 1958, when the old
story repeated itself, aggra-
vated by an exceptionally
warm autumn and winter
which hampered sales of
knitted outerwear. The profit
was a nominal one, and the
div. was passed altogether.
Last year began under highly
competitive and difficult trad-
ing conditions. Rather than
place their normal require-
ments ahead, most of the cus-
tomers’ buyers booked small
stock-replacement orders. This
reduced turnover and increased
manufacturing-costs per unit.
The second half of the term
showed gradual but substantial
improvement. Normal winter
conditions prevailed, the wool-
market advanced and Bruce
Pie was able to step-up its out-
put and reduce stocks. The
plant operated on a two-shift
basis.

REPORT OF THE HONORARY COUNCIL FOR THE
FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30th JUNE, 1959
Adopted by the Annual Meeting of the Association held in the Board
Room, The Mutual Life &■ Citizens' Assurance Co. Ltd. Building, Martin
Place, Sydney, on Friday, 30th October, 1959
'T’HE Council has pleasure in presenting the Thirteenth Annual Report
and Financial Statements for the year ended 30th June, 1959.
DEVELOPMENT
Membership continued to grow steadily during the year, and now exceeds 2,800,000.
In Queensland and Tasmania over 730,000 are also eligible for hospital benefits. The
consistent increase of new members in this by far the largest of the benefit funds is
further evidence of the extent of public approval of the principles of the National
Health Scheme.
The decentralisation of the Fund’s enrolment and contribution collection activities
through more than 10,000 employee groups and chemist-agencies makes it possible
for the general public to qualify readily for National Health Benefits. Employers
general Iv recognise the importance of voluntary health insurance and assist their
employees by enabling them to have contributions deducted from pay.
BLUE CROSS ASSOCIATION
The Fund is a member of the Blue Cross Association, which is the co-ordinating
body of the major non-profit health insurance funds in the Commonwealth. Blue
Cross looks to the pooling of experience and research to the overall advantage of
contributors to the funds and provides an interstate transfer reciprocity agreement
whereby Fund members who take up residence in another State and join an
affiliated Fund may preserve their benefit rights.
Giving a lead to their respective Governments, the American Blue Cross Commission
operating in the U.S.A. and Canada and the Australian Blue Cross Association
this year took the bold step of formulating and ratifying a membership transfer
reciprocity agreement.
BENEFITS AND ADMINISTRATION
During the year benefits paid amounted to £9,525,000, an increase of £1,609,000
over the previous vear. This takes the total benefits paid since the Fund’s inception
to almost £35,140,000 and reflects the measure of assistance given to its
contributors and their families.
Payment of small straightforward medical benefit claims in cash over the counter,
a feature of Fund service almost unique in insurance of any kind, enabled tire
immediate settlement of one-third of all medical claims. A number of such offices
were opened, and more are projected when suitable staff are trained and premises
become available. Meanwhile, all claims are on an average settled within a week.
Staff efficiency and service to the public improved and important economies were
achieved in those areas serviced from the Fund's own premises in Brisbane,
Canberra, Hobart, Launceston, Newcastle and Townsville. As foreshadowed in the
last annual report, the construction of a new thirteen-storey building in George
Street, Sydney has commenced. The staff, now scattered over four locations in the
city, will be brought together in the new building. This will also permit a closer
integration of the staffs of the associated Hospitals Contribution Fund and
Medical Benefits Fund as a service to the public should the honorary executive
committees of the two funds decide to occupy the new building jointly.
CHRONIC AILMENTS
On Ist January, 1959. the Fund opened “Special” Accounts for both its medical
and hospital activities under the National Health Act. Briefly, the arrangement
provides that a benefit fund opening a Special Account must transfer to that
account persons 65 years of age and over. A fund may also transfer those persons
claiming benefit for a pre-existing or chronic ailment or upon attaining annual
benefit limits.
The Commonwealth Government underwrites losses in the Special Account and in
return requires funds to liberalise membership conditions for the remaining
contributors. The innovation has been the means of giving considerable assistance
to the chronically ill. However, your Council is of the opinion that the chosen
methods are cumbersome and wasteful and accordingly has recommended
alternatives to the Government.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
With assets exceeding £2,600,000, of which £1,867,000 are liquid, the financial
position is regarded as sound. Administrative expenses for the year absorbed only
12.5% of income.
In accepting the Government’s invitation to open Special Accounts, the Fund
for the first time found it necessary to call on its basic reserves. A contingent
asset exists in respect of Special Account expenditure still to be reimbursed by
the Commonwealth Government. This temporary drain on reserves coincided with
the influenza epidemic in the autumn, and this clearly vindicates Council’s
prudent action over the years' in establishing strong reserves in the interest of
contributors. Council recommends the transfer of the sum of £102,300 to Claims
Reserve, bringing the total Claims Reserve to £2,427,300, representing 13/6 per
person covered, as against 14/8 the previous year.
APPRECIATION OF SERVICES
The Council expresses its thanks to:
Employers and group secretaries, to receiving agents, chemists and to members of
the medical profession who have co-operated so wholeheartedly in assisting their
employees and the public generally in securing the advantages of membership
with the Fund.
The affiliated Hospitals Contribution Fund of N.S.W. for its valuable assistance.
The Management and Staff, whose untiring efforts and helpfulness to the public
have assisted in building an unparalleled utility which is now a vital part of
the Australian way of life.

were traded below par for

The co. is in a sound
financial position, but its
earning-power largely depends
on factors beyond its control
—world wool prices, competi-
tion from overseas imports,
weather conditions and cus-
tomers’ tastes. At this stage
prospects for the current year
appear satisfactory. The re-
covery in wool prices means
that the - co., which holds
adequate stocks of yarn and
wool-tops bought cheaply, may
find it easier to market its
products at competitive prices.


Company Meeting
STREETS ICE CREAM LIMITED
RECORD SALES MARK
SILVER ANNIVERSARY OF COMPANY
The Chairman of Streets Ice
Cream Ltd. s Mr. K. Wiseman,
at the Twenty-fifth Annual
Meeting, held in Wollongong
on October 26, said : —
It is my privilege once again, on be-
half of the Directors, 'to welcome you to
our 25th Annual General Meeting, and
to present to you the Balance Sheet and
Incidental Accounts and Reports for the
year ended 30th June, 1959.
Before reviewing the Accounts and
the results for the year, I should like
to record and to draw to your attention,
the fact that this is the Silver Anni-
versary of the formation of the Com-
pany.
I think it is proper that, on this
occasion, we should take a little time at
this Meeting to look back in retrospect
and, after comparing the sales and
general financial position of the Com-
pany twenty-five years ago with that
now pertaining, appreciate the v great
foresight, industry and ambition of the
founders and their assistants, repre-
sented collectively here tonight in the
pei-son of Mr. Edwin Street. This com-
parison can best be appreciated by com-
paring the annual sales at that time,
amounting to £7276, with the sales
at 30th June last amounting to
£2,117,991.
The Directors .have seen fit to mark
the anniversary year by recommending,
as a supplement to the Dividend, a bonus
of 1%, to ( Which I , shall refer later.
Adverting to the accounts and the rel-
- the documents have been in your
hands for some time, and, unless other-
wise requested, I shall take them as
read in the usual course. In the pro-
duction of the Report, we have again
endeavored to play our part in the
current trend of disclosing as much
information as is possible concerning
the affairs of the Company, and we
hope that the Report will be well re-
ceived, as has been the ease in the past.
Last year the Company was awarded a
Certificate of Merit again by the Aus-
tralian Institute of Management. We
consider that this competition amongst
public companies is conducive to the
attainment of highest standards in
company practice and to the securing of
the confidence of Stockholders, employees
and the public alike.
The documents disclose another record
year, and a position which is most satis-
factory by any standards.
THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET:
The most pleasing feature’ disclosed by the Balance Sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is the degree of consolidation which has been effected
following the considerable expansion and capital expenditure involved over the
past few years:—-
PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
The balance brought forward from Ist July, 1958, after payment of
Final Dividend was .. .. .. .. .. . . .. £321,112
Added to this is the trading profit for the year amounting to . . .. 183,206
Making available for appropriation .. .. .. .. .. .. £504,318
Appropriated as follows :
Interim Dividend paid 1/5/1959 .. .. .. £32,649
Provision for proposed 8% Final Dividend and 1% Bonus
(making 15% distribution for the year) .. .. 48,975
Transferred to General Reserve . . . . .. . . 50,000
Leaving a balance to be carried forward for Use in the
business 372,694 £504,318
The Profit of £183,206 resulted
after charging £3,072 (last year
£2.510) for Directors’ Fees and
£115,192 (last year £83,183) for de-
preciation of fixed assets.
True it is that the increase in profit
was small, amounting to £3,359, and
that the ratio of profit earned to Stock-
holders’ Funds actually fell from 15.7%
to 14.6%. • “However, the year was
associated with some very difficult
trading factors including increased costs
of selling and distribution . which
necessitated adjustments of the prices
of some of our products.
ASSET MOVEMENTS
The Consolidated Balance Sheet shows that fixed assets increased by £175,353,
made up as follows: — J
Land and Buildings £68,656
Plant and machinery .. .. .. qn 7qq
Motor Vehicles .. .. .. ** '* " fi’oqc
Office Equipment .. .. .. .. . ’ || * ‘ 9’562
5 £175,353
On tlih’ other hand, eiitrent assets decreased by £73,504 explained
as follows :• —
Stocks increased from £152*829 to £165,111 .. .. .. £1^282
Sundry Debtors, etc., decreased from £70,161 to " *' ’
£60,798 .. .. .. ~ .. _ £g ggg
Cash at Bank, etc, decreased from £113,214 to £50,372 62 842
Investment in Commonwealth Bonds decreased from ’
£13,581 to Nil 13,581
£85,786 £12,282
Offsetting the stock increase of
£12,282 against the other decreases
totalling -£85,786, there remains the
net decrease of £73,504. The explana-
tion is that liquid funds have been con-
verted into fixed assets; on this occa-
sion, principally plant and machinery.
LIABILITIES:
Turning to the liabilities side of the
Balance Sheet, it will be noted that the
funds subscribed from Share and Note
Issues remain the same, comprising
£544,162 in a like number of stock
units of £1 each, and £181,403 in a
like number of 7% registered Unsecured
Convertible Notes maturing 30th April,
1963. However, the total Stockholders’
Funds, amounting to £1,250,552, has
increased by £101,582, being Undis-
tributed Profits up £51,582 and General
Reserve up £50,000.
SALES:
Sales effected by the Company and its
Subsidiaries totalled £2,117,991 com-
pared with £2,017,067 last year. This
was an increase of approximately
£lOO,OOO and again established a new
high on the turnover chart.
DIVIDEND:
Although the profit only slightly in-
creased as compared with the previous
year, it is recommended that a-special
Bonus Dividend of 1%, absorbing
£5,442, be paid to mark the Silver
Anniversary of the formation of the
Limited Company. It is also recom-
mended that a Final Ordinary Dividend
of 8%, absorbing £43,533 be paid.
The Interim Dividend was 6%, which
absorbed £32,649. The total distribu-
tion for the year would then be 15%,
absorbing £81,624.
If this recommendation is approved
at this Meeting tonight, the final divi-
dend and the bonus dividend will be
paid on 31st October in order to coin-
cide with the payment of the interest
on the Convertible Notes, thereby saving
the expense of duplicating communica-
tions to the Stockholders and Note-
holders.
In view of the fact that the Com-
pany is still expanding and must pro-
vide the capacity necessary to deal
efficiently with the continued increase
in the demand for its products, the
Directors desire to continue their past
policy of maintaining the liquid position
of the Company to the fullest possible
extent by carrying forward as much as
possible of the profits. This policy has
been well vindicated by past results,
and the Directors seek your co-operation
by adopting their recommendation.
VALUE OF STOCK UNITS:
At the date of preparation of last
year’s Address, the market value of the
stock units was 57/6, and the market
value of the Convertible Notes was 43/3.
This year the market values, at date of
preparation of this Address, were 68/-
and 58/- respectively, representing in
the case of the Stock Units, a capital
appreciation of 18%, and in the case of
the Convertible Notes, 34%. Last year
the net tangible asset backing of each
Stock Unit of £l, taking into account
the recommended Final Dividend, was
40/9, whereas this year the figure
is 44/6.
INCREASE OF CAPITAL:
On 31st May last, the nominal
Capital of the Company was increased
from £750,000 to £2,000,000 by the
creation of 1,250,000 additional shares
of £1 each. As was explained to Stock-
holders who attended the Extraordinary
General Meeting on that date, and as
was notified to the Press, the action
taken by the Directors in this connec-
tion did not stem from any proposal to
make any bonus or cash issues for the
purpose of obtaining more Capital; the
position was that of the then existing
Nominal Capital of £750,000, the sum
of £514,162 had already been sub-
scribed, leaving only a margin of
£205,838 as the basis for future needs.
The conversion of the Convertible Notes
in 1963 will absorb £181,403 of that
margin, and it was not desiied that
the Company should be left in the posi-
tion of incurring delay and possible loss
if the means were not available to make
an issue at any time should the necessity
arise in that regard.
THE SUBSIDIARIES:
Each of the Company’s wholly'owned
subsidiaries —Lynams Ice Cream Pty.
Ltd., Ice Cream Messengers Pty. Ltd.,
and Wollongong Cold Storage Pty. Ltd.
—operated at a satisfactory profit, and
provided a valuable contribution to the
success achieved by the Company during
the year.
CURRENT PROSPECTS:
I am pleased to say that trading for
the first three months of this year shows
an increase as compared with the same
period of the previous j’ear. Trading
conditions and industrial relations have
been quite stable. The Company’s per-
sonnel are competent, and its machinery
is modern. The future is viewed with
quiet confidence.
DIRECTORS:
Many complex problems were ex-
perienced by the Directors during the
year, and the solution of them involved
a greater number of Meetings and many
hours of close deliberation. Owing to the
increased number of Meetings and the
appointment of an additional Director,
the fees paid to the Directors approached
the limit imposed by the Annual Meet-
ing in 1953. In order to rectify this
position, we have included in the Notice
convening this Meeting, a suggestion
that the remuneration of the Directors
should be such sum not exceeding
£3,000 per annum as may be fixed
by the Directors from time to time,
such sum when so fixed to be divided
amongst them in accordance with
Article 87. Mr. Edwin Street will ex-
plain this matter in more detail to you
later in the Meeting.
At their Meeting held on 7th
November, 1958, the Directors invited
Mr. A. J. Woodbury, the General
Manager of the Company, to take a seat
on the Board, and upon acceptance, he
was appointed accordingly. It was con-
sidered* that his elevation to the Board
would add value to the Board’s delibera-
tions. It would also create a desir-
able situation where the Board would
include three Executive Directors, so
that in the absence of one at any time,
there would remain two such Directors
who could share the considerable
responsibility of making important de-
cisions. In accordance with Article 85,
Mr. Woodbury’s appointment determines
at the commencement of this Meeting,
and he is obliged to leave his re-election


in your hands. The Directors'ask that
he be re-appointed and seek your con-
currence accordingly.
Our particular thanks are due to Mr.
Edwin Street for his constant interest
and invaluable advice, to Mr. R. M.
Street (Assistant Managing Director),
and to Mr. A. J. Woodbury for their
capable management and wholehearted
support.
CANBERRA REGISTER:
For the benefit of stockholders, par-
ticularly those concerned with settle-
ments and trusts, the Directors have
decided to establish a Share and Stock
Register at Canberra. It is expected
that this decision w-ill be implemented
shortly, following which a public
announcement will be made by the
Directors.
STAFF:
The total wages paid to our em-
ployees has increased to £464,912. It
is my pleasure, on behalf of the Board
of the Stockholders, to convey to the
Staff our recognition of and thanks for
their part in making the results of the
Silver Anniversary year so satisfactory.
We have again fostered the Staff
Superannuation Scheme, the contribu-
tions to which have increased to £3,855.
In addition, we are considering the for-
mation of an alternative Superannuation
Scheme which will provide greater
benefits to those Members of the Staff
who care to participate in it. The
details of this latter scheme have not
yet been finalised, but if the results
desired by the Directors can be imple-
mented, the Scheme will be introduced
within the near future.
The Directors w r ere pleased to attend
the Annual Staff Ball held at Rockdale
in September, and appreciated the
opportunity to take part in such a
pleasant social function.
CONCLUSION:
I convey our gratitude to the Stock-
holders and to our Customers for their
equally important contributions to the
financial welfare and increased prestige
of the Company, and I hope that the
(disclosures contained in the Annual
Reports and in this Address will be
found satisfactory to all concerned.
I now move the adoption of the
Report of the Directors, the Balance
Sheet and the Profit and Loss Account
in respect of the year ended 30th June,
1959, as printed and circulated, and
have much pleasure in asking the
Managing Director, Mr. Edwin Street,
to second the motion and to include
in his remarks some of the early history
of the Company so that the details may
be recorded for future use.
MANAGING DIRECTOR'S
ADDRESS
The Managing Director, Mr.
Edwin Street, said:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have much pleasure in formally
seconding the motion of the Chairman
for the adoption of the Reports and
Accounts of the Company for the year
ended 30th June, 10.59.
It is fitting, indeed, that, in this our
Silver Anniversary Year, w T e have
achieved a record turnover and profit.
The Company was first incorporated on
4th October, 1934, under the name of
lllawarra Delicacies Co. Limited, the
principal shareholders being Mr. Daniel
Street, Mr. W. E. Jones and myself. In
1937 the name was changed to lllawarra
Delicacies Company (Pty.) Limited, and
in 1947 it was again changed to the
present name of Streets Ice Cream
Limited. In the same year, the con-
stitution of the Company, through its
Memorandum and Articles of Associa-
tion, was amended to give it Public
Company status and to comply with the
requirements of the Sydney Stock Ex-
change. Following the public issue in
1952, the Company became a Public
Company in the full sense of the word,
and it was accepted by the Sydney
Stock Exchange as a Company whose
shares were suitable to be placed upon
its list.
DIRECTORS !
Trading conditions were more difficult
than usual during the year owing to
strong competition, and this placed a
greater demand upon the time of the
Directors. The proposed increase in
Directors’ fees is, in my opinion, fully
justified, and I ask you to give this
matter your earnest consideration.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE:
Industry today requires big invest-
ment ; modern plant is expensive.
Machinery becomes obsolete quickly due
to improvements and the accelerated
trend to automation. In many cases
the book value of the asset must be
disregarded when considering whether
it should be replaced with more modern
plant capable of higher productivity.
Particularly in a highly competitive in-
dustry such as ours, “horse and buggy”
methods would lead to disaster.
EXPANSION:
The buoyant conditions in Australia
are due to an inflow of overseas invest-
ment, sustained migration, hire pur-
chase and Government spending. The
population is increasing at the rate of
about 21% per anum, and this is ex-
pected to increase to 4%. The economy
of the country continues to expand, and
the outlook is very favourable to enter-
prise. The Company will take advantage
of every opportunity to share in this
expansion.
Incidentally, I do feel that our stock-
holders and Noteholders can be of
material assistance in increasing our
sales potential. I know that you ave
proud of the products marketed by your
Company and will not hesitate in recom-
mending them to all of your friends.
AMBASSADOR REFRIGERATION
PTY. LTD.:
A wholly owned Subsidiary, known as
Ambassador Refrigeration Ptv. Ltd., has
been formed to provide our Customers
with commercial refrigeration units of the
highest standard and most modern de-
sign. A temporary showroom has been
opened at Firth Street, Arncliffe, and
the business will function from this
address until a modern showroom and
workshop is built on two acres of land
which we have purchased near our exist-
ing Factory. Mr. Keith Perkins, who has
been with the Company at Corrimal for
many years in charge of our Refrigera-
tion on the South Coast, has been
appointed Manager.
DEPOTS:
During the year a Distribution Depot
was established at Nowra, in order to
consolidate our position 'in this area.
The results at all of the Depots are
most heartening, and the Directors are
pleased at the consolidation which has
taken place in these areas. The addi-
tional sales outlets provided by the
Depots established over the past few
years proved the wisdom and foresight
involved in their establishment; the
increased turnover reflecting the in-
creased profit largely resulting from
their activities.
QUALITY CONTROL:
We' have completed the installation
of an experimental plant, and as a
consequence, we are now able to pro-
ceed w'ith plans for product develop-
ment and quality control. Here batches
of Ice Cream are manufactured in
exactly the same manner as in the
factory, the equipment used being
identical to the production units but of
laboratory capacity. Every step is
carried out under actual operation con-
ditions, and the resultant product is
used as the basis for full scale pro-
duction. It is a major step in ensuring
uniform high quality. In addition, a
responsible Executive has been placed
in charge of quality control. This
appointment is intended to ensure the
maintenance of high quality in all of
the Company’s products.
In conclusion, I wish to thank my
Co-Directors for their co-operation, and
all of our Executives, Staff, and Em-
ployees generally for their excellent
efforts during the year, and I thank
also our Stockholders and Customers
for their continued support.
MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Wellington, October 27.
VX/Tth the worst of its
balance - of - payments
problem behind it, New Zea-
land seems to be on the verge
of a new era of expansion.
Though no change in official
policy has been announced,
there have been signs in the
last few weeks of some relaxa-
tion of financial controls and
of a more positive attitude
toward development. A reduc-
tion in the Reserve Bank’s dis-
count-rate from 7 to 6 per
cent, is a straw in the wind.
Theoretically, a reduction in
the discount-rate eases restraint
on bank credit. Practically, at
the moment, it does not mean
much, because the trading
banks are not in debt to the
Reserve Bank. Of more signi-
ficance is the fact that over
the last few weeks the banks
have been allowed to stay out
of debt and to build-up a
margin of free cash. At
October 14 their balances at
the Reserve Bank exceeded the
statutory minimum of £64.7
million by £7.5 million. That
is not rfiuch, but not so long
ago the banks were being
forced “into the red” to the
extent of about £12 million.
The Reserve Bank says that
the reduction in the discount-
rate does not denote a change
in credit-policy. But the hint
seems to be there that the bank
would not mind if there were
some increase in advances from
the present level.
Bank advances have been
fairly steady for four years and
are now actually below the
1955 level. Normally they
should rise, with the expansion
of the economy, by £5 million
to £8 million a year. The
banks have obviously done at
least their share, probably
more, in controlling inflation.
A willingness on the part
of the Reserve Bank to see
some increase in advances now,
perhaps to the extent of a
resumption of the normal
annual rise, seems to be im-
plied by its statement that the
cut in the discount-rate is
intended as a reflection of the
improvement which has taken
place in economic conditions
generally.
■Deflecting the large number
of bonus-issues in recent
months, latest statistics show
that the Capital Issues Com-
mittee has given approval
for new issues totalling £11.9
million in the third quarter of
this year. This is £5.3 million
more than in the correspond-
ing period of 1958. Approvals
involving new finance
accounted for £3.8 million of
the total, against £2.7 million
last year. Applications de-
clined or deferred amounted to
£1.4 million, against £1.5
million.
Recent tax-legislation con-
tains at least one provision
which will cause headaches for
companies, for the Stock
Exchange and for investors.
It provides that bonus-shares
issued from profits derived
before March 31, 1957, and
therefore treated as non-
assessable income for tax-
purposes in shareholders’
hands, must be distinguished
from other shares issued by the
same company. The reason
for requiring separate identi-
fication is that if the company
at any time within ten years
returns to shareholders any
capital represented by the
bonus-shares, the amount re-
turned is taxable as a dividend.
The provision means that
each bonus-issue will create a
new category of shares, similar
to, but not identical with, an
existing category. A great deal
of clerical work and, inevitably,
some confusion will be caused.
It may be that separate
classification is necessary in the
case of small private com-
panies which could make a
bonus-share issue shortly
before ceasing operations and
returning capital to share-
holders, thus evading tax. But
it seems most unnecessary In
the case of public companies
whose shares are officially
listed on the Stock Exchange.
The Exchange has made repre-
sentations to the Government,
but has received no satisfaction.
"Mew Zealand is on the verge
of the greatest retailing
boom it has ever seen, according
to the manager of a large Hast-
ings department-store. He said
that all over the world larger
stores were monopolising the
trade. The tremendous boom
in other countries was only
reaching the Dominion now.
The chairman of Hay’s, Ltd.,
a Christchurch department-
store, takes a more conserva-
tive view. Suggestions that the
retail-trade is about to enter
a “bonanza” period should be
treated with reserve, he says.
The prospects ahead are much
brighter than a year ago, and
it is reasonable to assume that
there will be greater buoyancy
of trade. But, with ever-
increasing costs, it is imperative
that turnover should increase.
His opinion is that there will
be a steady, but not spectacular,
rise in turnover.


Memoirs of a
Pioneer Pressman
(Abridged from a book to be published later)
By B. S. BAXTER COOK
(Founder of the Australian Journalists’ Association and No. 1 A.J.A. Gold- Medallist}
When Colonel W. T.
Peay, formerly editor
of the Hamilton
“Spectator,” followed
“the Boss” in the editorial
chair of Melbourne “Herald”
(S. V. Winter having decided
to confine his duties more to
those of a director), he began
to assert his authority in a
way that soon made him very
unpopular with the reporting
staff.
Reay was the typical pro-
duct of the military school.
Precision and exactitude in the
following of his instructions,
and particularly in the proper
use of words, seemed always
to be uppermost in his mind.
The use of a slightly inappro-
priate word when a more fitting
one might have been employed,
or where a loosely constructed
sentence had been used that
might have been improved by
the application of a little
Of the Not-so-noble (from
Phil May’s Bulletin
series “Things We See
When We Come Out
Without Our Gun”).
thought, always roused his ire.
Good style in writing seemed
to be more important to him
than time; but time, as the
old Boss often impressed on
me, is the greatest factor in
evening-paper production. This
is nearly always rush work,
and reporters of those days
felt that if they had to pause
and search their minds for the
exact way that Reay would
want the news-subject to be
dealt with, their train of
thought in presenting the facts
would be broken; and their
concentration on the news-
value of the item would be
stultified, to say nothing of
the time lost.
I had heard the old Boss say
more than once that a daily
newspaper had no call to be
“highbrow.” It had to cater
for the average intelligence of
the reading public. “After all,”
he remarked on one occasion,
“it is read one day and the
next is probably used
to wrap-up a pound
of sausages.” (This
thought may also be
found in the use of
the word “tripe” in
relation to poor press
work.)
It was to Reay’s credit that
he always sought perfection,
as it prevented reporters lapsing
into slovenly work, but the
trouble was that it was always
his brand of perfection. If
members of the staff did not
measure-up to his one-track
mind in this connection they
were made to understand in no
uncertain way that their work
was very unsatisfactory. This
only served to unsettle and
exasperate the staff. His close
personal scrutiny of all
“proofs” and his idea of
brightening the columns of
the “Herald” and “Weekly
Times” extended even to the
fishing-notes. These com-
prised such soul-stirring hap-
penings as “snapper are now
biting better on squid,” or the
so-and-so party “got a good
“Australia’s Noblest Son.”
haul off the Mordialloc reef,”
and so on.
The writer of these notes was
an outside contributor. I
happened to know him person-
ally, and the Colonel said one
day: “Ask your friend to have
a look at his stuff in the
‘Weekly Times’ and note the
alterations I have had to
make.”
My friend tersely said some-
thing to this effect: “You can
tell- the Colonel to jump in the
lake. If he thinks I am going
to worry about reading my
fishing-notes in print, ask him
to double the miserable seven-
and-six a week I now get for
them.”
Needless to say, that was not
exactly the way I reported
back to the Colonel.
one occasion—and there
were many such —when
Reay had assembled the staff
and was proceeding to tell all
and sundry how badly they
were doing their work, the
elderly chief sub-editor, Colonel
Walstab, could not conceal his
irritation. Quoting “Hamlet,”
he said, “Let the galled jade
wince, our withers are un-
wrung.”
The old soldier, whom every-
one held in the highest regard,
thereupon gathered himself up
in his full military bearing and
marched majestically from the
room. Somehow that incident
seemed to relieve the pent-up
feelings of all of us. The rest
of Reay’s lecture went harm-
lessly over our heads.
But Reay had a soft spot
for a few members of the staff,
who seemed never to be able
to do anything wrong. One was
Ernest Besant Scott, a special
writer, afterwards Sir Ernest
and Professor of English at the
Melbourne University. It was
vindictively said that the
Colonel was afraid to criticise
his work lest he walk out on
him. He was certainly a
brilliant man, and much too
valuable to lose.
Another member of the
staff who was in the Colonel’s
good books was Patrick Ben-
nett, a friendly and consci-
entious soul, affectionately
addressed as “Paddy.” He was
in charge of the State political
round, and as the Colonel’s
ambition was to make the
“Herald” an influential political
power, Paddy played right into
his hand. Nobody else on the
staff at that time took much
interest in politics.
Then we had also on the
regular staff a retired military
captain named Walton. It
must be confessed that in those
days only a few general
reporters worried about the


difference between a battalion
and a brigade. Walton was
not highly regarded as a news-
gatherer, but he was a good
descriptive writer. He was
very apt in military affairs, and
was a handy man in reporting
A few more specimens
of “Things We See When
We Come Out Without
Our Gun.”
military reviews and other
similar manoeuvres.
The staff man who bore the
impressive nomenclature of
“Sporting Editor” was Frank
Hanna, a calm-and-collected
type who never allowed him-
self to be rattled. He had no
one to assist him in covering
the wide horseracing field of
activities. One day, when
Reay complained that an im-
portant racing item had been
missed, Frank calmly re-
minded him that each day he
was supposed to write his
sporting-notes for the “Herald”
in about half-an-hour, and
that the rest of his time was
occupied on general report-
ing work, whereas the morning
papers had men doing nothing
else all the week but the gather-
ing of sporting information.
Frank said afterwards that for
the first time Reay seemed
stumped for words.
Another general reporter
who was also expected to
supply a section on sport was
Tommy Kelynack, a very
popular colleague. His domain
was football, and. he ' wrote
under the nom-de-plume “Kick-
ero.” Like Frank Hanna he
had very little time-off from
his general staff duties to gather
the matter for his weekly foot-
ball-budget. He rightly
resented the Colonel’s adverse
criticism of his matter, con-
sidering the few opportunities
that were afforded him to move
around among the many foot-
ball-club headquarters.
One day Tommy came out
of the Colonel’s room flush-
faced but triumphant.
“I stood up to the blighter
today,” he chortled. “He’s got
a yellow streak.”
'T'he constant pinpricking of
this military martinet, who
went the wrong way about
getting the best out of his staff,
wore me down, when I was not
much more than a kid, to a
state bordering on nervous
exhaustion. I was in that con-
dition when I decided to con-
sult the family doctor, Charles
Player, of Malvern. I ex-
plained my trouble at some
length.
“Is that all?” he lightly com-
mented. In effect, he went on
to say: “You know T am
responsible for the weekly
medical-column in the ‘Herald’
and ‘Weekly Times,’ and he
tries to tell me how I should
do my work. My advice is to
take no notice of his criticism
unless it is constructive and
helpful. Comfort yourself with
the conviction that you have
done your best. No man should
be vain enough to suppose that
he is the font of all wisdom.
It's well to remember, too, that
it is easier to alter or destroy
than construct. The Colonel
means well, but it does not
necessarily follow that he is
right.”
This pep-talk, combined
with Tommy Kelynack’s “dis-
covery,” helped to restore con-
fidence in myself. Moreover,
my duodenal ulcer began to
respond to the dietary scale Dr
Player put me on.
'T'HE difference between Winter
and Reay was this: Winter
was hasty and hot tempered,
but he rapidly got over his tan-
trums. Nobody seemed hurt by
his extravagant outbursts, and
everyone usually laughed about
them afterwards. Reay was
cold and calculating. He seemed
to use his cutting expressions
in a way that made you feel
as if you had been mentally
carved to bits. No wonder the
staff was utterly demoralised.
It was about this time that I
purged this doggerel out of
my system, and felt much
better, thank you:
T mentioned that in 1899 the
three Melbourne metro-
politan daily papers decided to
dispatch members of their

staffs as war-correspondents to
the South African conflict.
The choice of the “Herald”
directors fell on Reay.
Members of the reporting
staff, smarting under his sharp
criticisms, were anxious to see
how he would acquit himself as
a working journalist. Reay’s
dispatches were good in their
way, but so lengthy and replete
with military detail that they
did not create the widespread
public interest that was ex-
pected. Members of the staff
were practically unanimous in
awarding him low marks as the
kind of reporter he envisaged
in his capacity of editor.
Reay wrote one piece, how-
ever, that did stir the emotions
of the people. It was headed
“The Highland Brigade is
Burying Its Dead.” It was
widely recognised as a notable
contribution to the war-
literature of the times, and was
a set piece often recited at
public gatherings.
POLITICAL BEGINNING
It was in 1901, when the
Commonwealth of Aus-
tralia had been established
and the Federal depart-
ments were being created in
Melbourne (the temporary seat
of the Federal Government)
that Colonel Reay called me
into his room, and something
like the following colloquy
took place:
“What do you know about
politics?”
“Nothing,” I said, rather
flippantly.
“I thought so. Well, it’s
quite time you started to learn.”
“Sorry, Colonel, but I did
not know you were serious.”
“I am. Moreover, I want
you to prepare yourself to take
charge of the Federal political
round!”
“Yes, sir,” I said dutifully,
but feeling as limp as a sweat-
soaked dicky on a hot day. I
had been very comfortably
placed when in charge of the
Supreme Court. I had made
a number of legal friends,
always very approachable
and ready to explain in
simple language the knotty
legal problems in cases that
arose from time to time which
were difficult for a layman to
elucidate
But, all the same, I felt that
the Colonel’s rebuke was justi-
fied. There was no excuse for
my having neglected what was
undoubtedly the duty of every
young citizen. I had been satis-
fied, like a large number of
others, to leave that duty to
those who liked public life. It
never occurred to me that the
very existence of a free people
should always rest on a sound,
democratic political base.
With all the zeal of the con-
vert, I now devoted all my
spare time to picking-up the
very few political threads of
my life and trying to weave
them into something like a
pattern of political thought.
Fortunately, I had always
been a diligent reader of the
daily papers, and I suppose that
subconsciously I imbibed some-
thing about politics. But I
felt that what I sadly needed,
as Pope says, was “a guide,
philosopher and friend.” Then
I had a brainwave. What
about Sam Mauger?
I did not then know Mauger
well personally, but I had
often read of his activities as
the honorary secretary of the
Anti-Sweating League. I felt
that he would be co-operative,
as he had gathered together
some of the best public-
spirited citizens. The rendez-
vous was the upstairs room of
Sam Mauger’s hat-shop, at
66 Bourke Street. “Sixty-six”
was then becoming as famous
in Melbourne as was No. 10
Downing Street in London.
The t h e n conservative
“Argus” regarded “Sixty-six”
as the incubator of liberal and
democratic plots to revolu-
tionise the old order of things.
The “Age” was radical, but
dictatorial. The “Herald” stuck
to its motto “Impartial not
Neutral,” but gave the move-
ment a fair amount of space.
To ensure the passage
through Parliament of a more
effective Shop and Factories
Act to provide machinery to
shorten hours and fix wages,
proceedings at “Sixty-six” be-
came more generally political,
and sufficient influence was
eventually brought to bear to
enable the necessary Act to be
passed. Sir Alexander Peacock
is generally regarded as the
father of the Amended Shop
and Factories Act, but Sam
Mauger had done most of the
slogging foundation-work.
Tt was to Sam Mauger, there-
fore, that I brought my pre-
dicament, with particular
reference to the close scrutiny
I knew would be exercised by
Reay. I confessed that I was
a complete neophyte in politics
and was appalled at the thought
that I should have to write on
Federal political matters, of the
ins and outs of which I hardly
knew more than a schoolboy.
I feared “Constant Reader”
and “Pro Bono Publico” and
the host of other anonymous
correspondents, whose pens
would always be ready to
inform the editor what an
ignoramus he had as a political
reporter.
Sam only laughed at my
fears. He said he knew the
Colonel as one of those who
was always trying to do the
right thing but often in the
wrong way. Sam invited me to
call on him at any time. I took
full advantage of this co-
operation. We discussed
possible political developments,
and between us we often
“cooked-up” readable stories.
The Colonel could not
understand the rapid progress
I seemed to be making, so he
decided to check-up with his
friend, Sam Mauger. That day,
when I called, I found Sam
bubbling over to tell me the
joke. He had informed the
Colonel that he had read my
stuff in the paper with great
interest, and could assure him
that I always seemed to be
right on the target! (This was
very good, seeing that, at the
time, Sam was a sort of co-
author.)
The “Herald” in those days
had very little influence in the
political world. The morning
papers monopolised the field.
1 had to do my daily round of
the Federal Ministerial de-
partments by myself, whereas
the Melbourne morning-paper
men, together with the repre-
sentatives of papers in other
States and news-agency men,
hunted in a pack, or divided-
up the assignments and ex-
changed the news afterwards.
Naturally, Ministers and heads
of departments were more
ready to relax at a general
press-talk than they were when
interrupted in their work by
the sole representative of a
politically uninfiuential even-
ing paper.
My close contact with Sam
Mauger was therefore very
important, especially when he
became Postmaster-General in
the second Deakin Administra-
tion, 1905-8, as I was able
to check-up with him on the
true facts of political happen-
ings. He never divulged any
confidential Cabinet matters,
but he often saved me from
following a false scent. I
always attended the general
press-conferences, however,
because they kept me abreast
of possible political develop-
ments, although any “copy”
resulting was, of course, too
late for that day’s evening!
paper.
At one of these mass press
interviews a bit of quick think-
ing by a hard-boiled journalist
resulted in a scoop which
raised a nice question of con-
duct unbecoming a Gentleman
of the Press. This was before
the Australian Journalists’
Association had adopted a
“Code of Ethics.”
There had been one of the
periodical conferences of State
Treasurers, presided over by
the Federal Treasurer —at this
time, Sir George Turner. After
the first day’s proceedings we
political roundsmen crowded
up against the round table to
learn if there was any news.
As usual, each Treasurer had
been provided with a blotting-
paper pad. The pressman in
question was toying with the
pad in front of him.
“You won’t find anything on
that,” said Sir George. “The
outside sheets have already
been destroyed.”

Cup Carnival
Though they were only
lining-up for the big race when
these pages were already away,
the Melbourne Cup Carnival
had given ample promise of a
notable meeting.
One thing about it that could
seem strange is to suggest that
a colt who wins a Derby by
five lengths was lucky ; yet it
is true that Travel Boy, in
winning the V.R.C. classic, did
have all the breaks, particu-
larly in the fact that Martello
Towers, who had beaten him
consistently in Sydney, was a
seriously hurt casualty. At
the start the grey became upset
by the antics of Gallant Star
in the adjoining stall, and
lashed out, cutting his off hind-
leg badly.
The injury caught up with
him three furlongs from home.
At that stage Martello Towers
led narrowly from Travel Boy,
with Dhaulagiri going well
behind them. Suddenly the
grey dropped back, severely
interfering with Dhaulagiri,
who in turn caused Ringleader
to be checked abruptly.
Meanwhile Travel Boy had
cleared away to an unbeat-
able lead. Ringleader finished
well for his second, with
Roman Reveller third. Mar-
tello Towers hobbled past the
post a furlong behind the
winner.
Bought in New Zealand by
trainer T. J. Smith for 1700gns.,
Travel Boy is a bay colt by Marco
Polo II from Mere-Ana by Fox-
bridge (imp.) from Konneta by
Bulandshar (imp.). Raced by Mrs.
T. J. Smith in partnership with Sir
Frank Packer, the colt last autumn
won the V.R.C. Sires’ Produce
Stakes, and seems to race better
at Flemington than at any other
track. The win gave Neville Sell-
wood his fourth in the V.R.C.
classic, his others being Delta
(1949), Prince Morvi (1953) and
Sailor’s Guide (1955).
With Lord scratched from
the 10-furlongs L. K. S. Mac-
kinnon Stakes the field did not
include a genuine w.-f.-a.
runner, and punters pinned
their hopes on Sir Blink, who
has never won at w.f.a. Like
so many scale events, the Mac-
kinnon was run at a dawdling
pace, and Ron Hutchinson—
the shrewdest rider in Aus-
tralia over a bit of ground—
dashed Trellios to the lead
seven furlongs from home. It
seemed strange to see Trellios,
“Lei’s drop our swags and have a game”
who has been coming from
well back in all his recent
races, acting as pilot, but with
Hutchy dictating the pace he
never looked like losing his
lead, and ran home strongly
an. easy winner from White
Hills and Supertax. A five-
year-old Helios gelding, Trellios
is owned by former Adelaide
newspaperman Dan Moriarty,
who backs his horses well and
has made a better success of
it than most people who have
tried to beat the books.
Adelaide colt Dalai lived up
to his reputation by winning
the Maribyrnong Plate, making
his record four wins from as
many starts. But the Plate
also proved that the Mel-
bourne-owned Rego gelding
Skadar is much above average
—poorly away, he did remark-
ably well to run Dalai to half-
a-neck. At his only other start
an easy winner of the Mari-
byrnong Trial, Skadar is a
youngster to watch. Dalai, of
course, is very good. In one
of his wins he equalled the
Australian record of 47sec. for
four furlongs. A brown colt
by Coronation Boy from Belle
of India, he’s trained by
Norman Plews, who won the
Maribyrnong Plate in 1951
with Cellar Master. A feature
of the Plate this year was that
six of the 11 runners were
last-start winners.
Neville Sellwood, who rarely
pays an unsuccessful visit to
Melbourne, rode the first leg
of a double (completed with
Travel Boy) when he got
Weeamera home in the Wake-
ful Stakes (10 furlongs ; three-
year-old fillies). It’s often a
preview of the Oaks ; last year
Chicola completed the double,
and Weeamera looks to have
a great chance of doing the
same. Winner of the Flight
Stakes at Randwick, she carried
a 141 b. penalty, and for the
Oaks drops 81b. to 8.10. By
Delville Wood from Gleeful,
she could credit her sire with
his second Oaks winner, Even-
ing Peal having won for him
in 1955 —the year before her
Melbourne Cup success. Weea-
mera is raced by N.S.W.
grazier A. J. Campbell and his
wife; they have had long
association with the racing
game.
The Oaks —to be run tomorrow
(Thursday)—dates back to 1861;
year of the first Melbourne Cup.
It’s run over a mile-and-a-half, and
this and the fact that the fillies
have., to carry 8.10 gives added
merit to the performance of
Session, when, in 1940, she ran
the distance in 2.30£, only half-a-
second outside Advocate’s V.R.C.
Derby record.

mera, 1 ; Mintaway, 2 ; Rose
of Summer, 3.

Punters were on the mark
when, on Derby Day, they
backed Anonyme from fives to
twos in the six-furlongs Smith-
field Handicap for three-year-
olds. The colt won easily. A
couple of months ago Anony-
me won two races at Caulfield
in excellent style, but he has
been tried since at a middle-
distance unsuccessfully. Speed
is his game at present, for
which he can thank his dam,
former brilliant sprinter La
Patrice. Possibly, being a
Landau colt, he will stick better
as he matures.

Sydney Horses
Judging by his runaway
victory in the Rosehill Second
Two - year - old Graduation
Stakes, Regained has a bright
future. One point worth noting
is that he had his stylish win
on a rain-soaked track. Raced
by R. C. and Mrs. Read, and
trained at Rosehill by Jack
Daniels, the Rego (imp.) colt
was bred by Carl Powell at
his Brooklyn Lodge Stud,
Aberdeen (N.S.W.), and is
from Miss Eagleton by Veil-
mond from Velox by Constant
Son (imp.).
With the leading jockeys in
Melbourne, it was a good day
for apprentices at Rosehill;
they bagged six of the eight
events. Keith Smith (he and
C. Pearson each had two
wins) lost his 31b. allowance
when he won the Flying on
Grenoble. Indentured to
Rosebery trainer L. O’Rourke,
Keith has won 92 races since
he secured his licence in
August two years ago. His
other win last Saturday was
on mudlark specialist Crebi-
ous in the concluding Welter.
Downfield Stud, Currabu-
bula (N.S.W.), catalogued two
yearling fillies for the Rand-
wick Easter sales, but with-
drew them. It is rare for
yearlings to be paraded already
named, but this pair had theirs
—All Agog and Margo. All
Agog comfortably defeated
hot favorite Miss Gigi in
Saturday’s Rosehill First Two-
year-old Graduation Stakes.
A big pull in weight made her
task easy on the heavy track.
Trained by A. J. Lyell and
raced by J. Lyne, she is by
imported Arab Legion (who
won at Caulfield) from Bretton
Woods by Manitoba (imp.)
from De Barry by Chief Ruler
(imp.). Flutter On (third)
should soon win.
Puen Buen Stud, Scone
(N.S.W.), has produced some
smart winners by Good Brandy
(imp.), and the list was added
to when Saydor finished
strongly to win the First
Parramatta Stakes. A three-
year-old gelding, he’s from
Queen Joy, who also threw,
among other winners, Field
Boy (A.J.C. Sires’ Produce
Stakes and Villiers). Favorite
Sun Idol’s third on the heavy
track with 9st. was good
enough to suggest a win when
the going improves a bit.
Before coming to Sydney
Just Kingdom won a race over
11 furlongs at Avondale (N.Z.),
and the heavy track was no
hindrance in his winning the
10-furlongs Rosehill Handi-
cap. Before the field lined-up
there was a rainstorm which
left water all over the course
and surroundings, and C.
Pearson’s allowance brought
weight down from 7.10 to 7.3.
Just Kingdom had, however,
won earlier at Randwick on
firm going, so the state of the
Rosehill track may not so
much have helped him as
hindered the opposition. He’s
trained by Mrs. E. M. Sloane,
who also trains Lavington, first
home in the Auburn Stakes,
only to lose on protest, the race
going to Nyroca.
Former Melbourne galloper
High Classic, now in L. J.
O’Sullivan’s Rosebery team,
was taken to the front in the
Second Parramatta Stakes and
tired to finish last, but the run
will have done him a lot of
good, and he showed enough
to suggest an early win. Prince
Crown, winner of a similar
race at the same track two
starts previously, cleared away
in the straight and had enough
in hand to be too solid for
Flying Balto.
* * *
Royal Jester’s brother was
in the field contesting a Three-
year-old Maiden at last week’s
Hawkesbury meeting, and,
moreover, he won. Racing as
Timonet, he was bought at the
N.Z. yearling-sales last year
for 425gn5., the bid of Rand-
wick trainer M. McCarten, but
he’s now prepared by Jim
McCurley. Bred by G. M.
Currie, of Koatanui Stud,
Wanganui, he’s by Timanova
(imp.) from Tendril (imp.) by
His Highness.
* * *
Passing Force gave his odds-
on backers an easy three-
lengths win in the First Two-
year-old Handicap at Doom-
ben, and he ran the five fur-
longs in 60.1/10. He’s another
of the Passing Glance (imp.)
breed: sons and daughters of
this son of Nearco have a
notable record on Brisbane
tracks. Passing Glance is from
Maid of Lome, a half-sister
to Gay Buzzard.

Other Sports
Those who saw the 1956
Olympics will never forget the
efficiency in that colorful and
exciting fortnight. Hence it’s
fitting that when the Aus-
tralian Olympic Federation
meets on November 22-23 a
special plaque permanently
commemorating the Games is
to be unveiled at the Mel-
bourne Cricket Ground.

Twenty - six - year - old Tas-
manian Kevin Buries, Austra-
lian amateur snooker
champion for 1959 —he beat
title-defender Frank Harris
(N.S.W.) eight frames to six—
has had only two years of
competitive snooker, but, as
well as the national title, he
has won the Tasmanian title
twice. Best break in this year’s
championship was Harris’s 82.
* * *
A round a day for a £1 —
that’s the charge to be made
for the privilege of watching
some of the world’s best
golfers in action this month.
Ampol’s tournament at Kens-
ington (Sydney) over three days
and ending on November 14 is
the first of the big affairs.
Then the stars fly to Melbourne
for the International Golf
Association’s Canada Cup
tourney starting on November
18 and ending four days later.
Ampol, which organised the
show for the 1.G.A., estimates
that the total Cup cost will be
about £BO,OOO. To recoup out-
lay there’ll need to be a fair
sort of total attendance, but
that’s not causing any worry.

“Amateurism”: It's becom-
ing harder and harder to define
an amateur. The British Isles
squash-team won all its Test-
matches and cleaned-up our
championships—as expected.
Its members were happy at
their results, and no doubt
were also pleased at the finan-
cial return. Australia paid all
their costs, and each man
received expenses of £2o' a
week. Not bad for a struggling
sport.

“K.R.”: N.S.W. country
cricket looks like getting some
boosting this year. The teams
of Test (or former Test), Shield
and good first-grade men that
now regularly visit country
centres to play local teams
will help the game along.
Several country men have been
picked in the State squad, and
several (including Bob Conolly,
of Wagga, better known as a
Rugby Union fullback) are in
the Colts squad. Also, a
Fijian team may tour country
districts, and two N.S.W.

“Athlete”: Betty Cuthbert,
holder of two world records
and the Olympic 100-metres
and 200-metres titles, is as
keen as ever. Now 21, she has
been making vital changes in
her style. She’s getting away
from the start by driving
forward at a low angle and
using plenty of leg force to
lift her body to the correct
sprinting position. Further-
more, she’s developing more
drive by dropping her exag-
gerated wide-arm swing and
replacing it with arms well con-
trolled and in a higher position.
It all means more speed, and
the probabilities are that Betty
will regain her national titles
from Marlene Matthews, as
well a§ chalking-up a record or
two.

Apart from the joint ambi-
tion of John and lisa Konrads
to return as the best family-
team in the history of the
Olympics, John has his eye on
four gold medals —an unpre-
cedented feat in Olympic
Games swimming. He might
do it, too, on the swimming-
programe as arranged to start
with the 100-metres, followed
by the 4 x 200-metre relay, the
400-metres and the 1500-
metres. For a swimmer as ver-
satile as Konrads each race
can therefore be taken as a
build-up for the longer dis-
tance ahead. Also, being
powerfully built an inch
short of 6ft., and now weigh-
ing 13.10 —he wouldn’t feel the
strain as much as a more
lightly-framed athlete would.
Last season, of course, he won
all the Australian freestyle
events at Hobart. That’s a good
sort of springboard.

a 50sec. 400-metres hurdles,
and a mile in 3.55. He was
i aU ghed at. But America’s
Parry O'Brien has touched
63ft. with the shot; the world
record for the high-jump stands
to a Russian at 7ft. lin. ; the
U.S. has three men who have
cleared 16ft. in the pole-vauit;
the mile time has been duly
cracked, and the 400-metre
record is below 45sec. What lies
ahead?

SPACE AND THE U.S.
"O eviewing the present state
of U.S. space-research the
Washington correspondent of
London “Economist” notes that
it will probably take the U.S.
two years to catch-up with
Russia, and that “if Soviet
rockets do not stay obligingly
within the 1.5-million-pound
mark in the meantime, it may
take a good many more.
“In this long-haul the
Americans are liable to en-
counter three major difficulties.
One is financial. This summer’s
experience with Congress—
when the House of Represen-
tatives made a sharp cut in
N.A.S.A.’s [National Aero-
nautics and Space Administra-
tion’s] budget, only part of
which was subsequently
restored—has bruised the faith
of those who thought that in
this one field at least Congress
would keep its purse-strings
loose.
“This year the United States
is spending a little under
$1 billion on space, of which
N.A.S.A. accounts for about
half and the Department of
Defence for most of the rest.
Dr. Glennan [head of N.A.S.A.]
thinks that the total ought to
rise to $2 billion a year in the
early nineteen-sixties. His
experts believe that they detect
a close relationship between
the frequency of Soviet suc-
cesses and the enthusiasm of
Congress for providing the
funds to match them ; thus they
find a roundabout consolation
in the present machine-gun
rattle of Russian shots to the
moon. But a runner who puts
on a spurt only when the man
in front increases his lead is
unlikely to find many people
betting on him.
“The second difficulty lies in
the still-unresolved relation-
ship between the civilian
—London “News Chronicle.”
“AFTER WHAT IT’S DONE FOR THE TORIES
THIS LITTLE JOB WILL BE CHICKEN-FEED.”
agency, N.A.S.A., and the
Defence Department’s interest
in space.
“So far there has been rela-
tively little conflict, because
anyone who thought he could
send something into the void
has been welcome to try. But,
as the number of projects in-
creases, so will the difficulty of
deciding which of them should
be controlled by the services.
“Senator Symington, who
conducted an investigation
into the problem earlier this
year, found that the liaison-
committee between the two
halves of the space-programme
was not working properly.
Although the committee has
now been strengthened, it is
still confined to making recom-
mendations ; in cases of con-
flict a final decision can come
only from the President, and
Mr. Eisenhower is notably bad
at settling these jurisdictional
disputes.
“The third difficulty goes
deepest. There are signs that
America is already running
into a shortage of scientists.
As Dr. Glennan put it recently:
“ ‘We have used-up much of
our rnissile technology. We
have drawn heavily on our
capital—the knowledge and ex-
perience accumulated . . . over
the past ten years or so.’
“The most pressing need is
for more technologists, pro-
perly trained in the funda-
mentals of science, who can
convert basic theory into new
practices. Already N.A.S.A.,
which is empowered by Con-
gress to pay its scientists more
than other Gov ernment
agencies may, has been sucking
talent away from other bodies,
This is the first field in which
the deficiencies of American
education have made themselves
felt sharply.
“In the long-run the answer
may be found in the schemes
—on which Congress made a
tentative start last year—for
giving Federal aid to the teach-
ing of science in schools. But
this solution is half a genera-
tion away; in the meantime
the Russians, pouring out their
flood of technologists, may well
be able to consolidate their
lead.”
Russia and China
■Examining the widely held
belief, shared by U.S.
Secretary of State Herter, that
Russia can be held at least
partly responsible for Chinese
actions in Tibet, Laos and
India, and that this will pro-
mote restraint and division in
the Communist camp, “blew
York Times” columnist James
Reston notes firstly that “there
is obviously some justification
for it”:
“Moscow is the arsenal of
Communism. The guns and
■planes along the China coast,
the shells landing on Quemoy
and the Matsus are made in
the Soviet Union.
“Moscow is acknowledged
by Peking, at least formally,
to be the leader of the Com-
munist States, and Khrushchev
at Camp David supported
Peking’s right to take For-
mosa and the offshore islands,
by force if necessary.
“Also, Mr. Herter is con-
cerned about the possibility
that the United States might

“For these reasons the Secre-

the actions of the Peking

is really behind Peking’s ven-

the contrary, China and Russia
can find themselves, economi-
cally, at swords’ points once
China begins bidding seriously

war.
“China, on the other hand,
is a have-not nation which
thinks it has a lot to gain by
aggressive expansionist policies.
“If anything is going to split
Moscow and Peking it will be
the stresses and strains of these
two nations in different stages
of development, with conflict-
ing attitudes about the use of
force, and even, as in Man-
churia and India, with con-
flicting long-range interests and
ambitions.
“The thing is not going to
be done with statements. In
fact, emphasis on the idea that
Peking is a satellite of Moscow
is precisely the sort of thing
that could force Khrushchev
to back Peking in a demand
for a seat at the summit. And
that, of course, would end the
summit and interrupt the
process of talking to Moscow
without Peking.”
Another New York
columnist, Roscoe Drummond,
of the “Herald Tribune,” notes
that an “under-surface disson-
ance” between Russia and
China has already been grow-
ing:
“The most tell-tale evidence
of basic policy differences be-
tween Moscow and Peking
emerges from the Soviet posi-
tion on disarmament and con-
trol of nuclear production and
tests. The Chinese Communists
want nothing so much as to
get their hands on nuclear
weapons. The Soviets want
nothing so much as to keep
Chinese Communist hands off
nuclear weapons —no doubt for
their own peace of mind.

chev has been personally pro-
mulgating suggestions—plapt-

ing an interview h#re, dropping
a hint there—that there ought
to be an atom-free zone in
Asia (significantly including
Red China) along the lines of
the Rapacki plan for an atom-
free zone in Central Europe.
- “Mr. K. began nine months
ago to ply Red China with his
proposal for an atom-free
Asia, and he said that if Red
China and ‘other peace-loving
nations’ in Asia would take
such initiative, ‘it would help
to a decisive degree’ in preserv-
ing peace in the Pacific.
“And, in an interview later,
Mr. Khrushchev pointedly
remarked: ‘The creation of an
atom-free zone in Asia will
contribute to lessening tensions
in this area and to removing
the danger of war in Asia.
There are now realistic con-
ditions for such a zone.’
“I wonder what reason the
Chinese Communists think the
Soviets have for not wanting
them to acquire nuclear
weapons. They might think
that the Soviets don’t trust
them —and vice versa. What l
am reporting is that such
doubts are now becoming
visible.”
A Chicago “Sun-Times”
editorial, as quoted by the New
York “Herald Tribune,” is
even more emphatic about the
essential differences of interest
between the two great Com-
munist Powers:
“China has three times the
manpower of Russia. The
Three Onlookers
T ondon “Economist” reports
the reactions of three im-
portant “onlookers” to the
result of the U.K. general elec-
tion :
“Neither of the two super-
powers felt any cause for dis-
satisfaction at Supermac’s
return. Although Mr. Khrush-
chev was twice reported as say-
ing that he would have been
a floating voter, possibly lean-
ing to the Tories, Mr. Eisen-
hower was necessarily more
discreet. It was felt in Wash-
ington that the President had,
at any rate, indicated where his
preference lay when he
appeared with Mr. Macmillan
on television during his London
visit.
“Although there has never
been any secret that some of
Mr. Macmillan’s post-Moscow
ideas, particularly on dis-
engagement and a quota-system
for nuclear-test inspections,
have given Mr. Eisenhower
some anxious moments, the
ties of their Algiers days have
held firm. The State Depart-
ment was thought to be appre-
hensive at the possibility of
doing business with Mr.
Bevan, although it had far
fewer reservations about Mr.
Gaitskell himself.
“The Soviet dialectic had
some minor trouble in getting
into gear when the time came
to analyse British political
behavior. While Moscow
Radio could not deny that the
summitry included in the Con-
servative party’s programme
was ‘based on the demands of
the broad masses of British
working-people,’ Mr. Nekrassov
could be found speculating in
‘Pravda’ on Labor’s inexplic-
able failure to see that ‘the
electoral promises of the Con-
servatives on foreign policy
were vague and could not
satisfy many electors.’
“Mr. Nekrassov, who
claimed to be drawing on
‘authoritative opinion,’ further
belabored the ham-handed
strategists in Transport House
on their home policy. ‘Repudi-
ation of a programme of

for higher wages and the
reduction of the working-day

position.’

up Mr. Macmillan on his tele-
vision statement that new pos-
sibilities were opening in the
international arena, ‘lzvestia’
thought the ‘near future’ would
show how capable the Tories
might prove on the issues ‘that
were at the heart of the British
electoral campaign’ (namely,
lasting peace and the end of
the cold war and the arms-
race).
“It was left to the Peking
‘People’s Daily’ to round-out
the full ideological picture.
Labor’s failure, it concluded
smugly, meant ‘the failure of
social-democratic reformism in
Britain.’ Keeping its ear close
to the quaking ground, the
paper could inform its readers
that it was believed in Britain
‘that the results of the election
will give impetus to the dis-
integration of the Labor party.’
This view, it felt able to say,
‘is not without grounds.’ ”
Dragnet Digest
London “Economist”: “In
Ceylon, Burma and elsewhere
Buddhist monks have acquired
an unpleasant reputation for
a kind of political violence that
is in flat contradiction to their
nominal creed. They have con-
tributed their share to the
generally pernicious effect that
religious extremists have had
on modern Asian politics.
“It was a Hindu fanatic who
killed Gandhi because the
Mahatma had insisted on the
brotherhood of all creeds —
specifically, between Hindus
and Moslems. It was the die-
hard Moslem mullahs whose
demands made it* so difficult
for Pakistan to devise a Con-
stitution, and who have left
their retrograde mark firmly
stamped on that country’s un-
happy political record. The
murder of Bandaranaike may
freshly open Ceylonese and
other Asian eyes to this evil.
If it makes his fellow country-
men less susceptible to the
violent slogans of the fanatic
(and this could have its ironic
side, in view of his earlier en-
couragement of Buddhist in-
transigence) the sacrifice will
not have been a vain one.”

London “Time and Tide ” ;
“The Western nations under-
stand physical threats, but they
have still much to learn in the
field of ideas which Mr.
Khrushchev is determined to
make the main battlefield.
Since his visit to the United
States some prominent
American columnists have
begun to perceive that the
ideological battle begins at
home, and that it is impossible
to convince the uncommitted
nations on a purely economic
level. They are voicing the
stark need to moral
and spiritual values in
national life.
“Earlier this year Adlai
Stevenson said: ‘I believe that
we have had enough of adjust-
ment, conformity, easy options
and the least-common-denomi-
nator. The dreary failure in
history of all classes committed
to pleasure and profit alone,
the vacuity and misery accom-
panying the sole pursuit of
ease, the collapse of the French
aristocracy, the corruption of
imperial Rome ; all these facts
of history do not lose their
point because the pleasures of
today are no longer the enjoy-
ments of an elite. If we be-
come a nation of Bourbons,
numbers won’t save us. Vacuity
and indifference are not re-
deemed by the fact that every-
one can share them. They
merely restrict the circle from
which regeneration can
come.’ ”
* * . *
Roscoe Drummond, in N.Y.
“Herald Tribune” : “There are
two things Mr. Khrushchev
wants which I am confident we
[the IJ.S.] will not give. He
wants the American Govern-
ment’s blessing, assent and
formal acceptance of the
Soviet status quo in Eastern
Europe. He wants us to
commit ourselves to saying
that the Soviet satellite-
world is fixed, firm and
for ever. And by getting
us to accept the status quo, the
Kremlin means that there must
be no American public protests,
no American press criticism of
anything Moscow does in its
‘orbit.’ The President couldn’t
give this assurance even if he
wished.”

London “Observer”: “That
the great Powers have cut their
Armies [over the past several
years] is not because of any
agreement to disarm, but be-
cause individually they have
decided what they need in a
nuclear age—or can afford.
“In the negotiations from
the end of the war until 1955
nothing was achieved to bridge
the gap between the Russian
plan for a flat-rate reduction
(a third) of all armed forces
and the Western for reduction
to specified levels (Russia,
China, United States—l,soo,ooo
men ; Britain, France—around
700,000).
“When Russia came round
to the Western view, the United
States first sought to raise the
levels (to 2,500,000 for Russia,
China, United States), and then
agreed to lower them if the
reductions were dependent on
reaching political settlements.
Russia would not have them
linked, and a final concession
by the West in 1957 for a three-
stage reduction without
political settlement failed to
save the negotiations in the
Disarmament Sub-Committee.”

Manchester “Guardian” ;
“The East German leaders
must be alarmed by the grow-
ing proportion of young men
among the refugees escaping to
Western Germany. Neither the
threat of punishment nor the
introduction of stiffer controls
at all crossing-points has had
the intended effect. Figures
just published by the German
Social Democrats show that of
all the refugees who fled to
West Berlin in December
(1958), 25.5 per cent, were
males between the ages of 18
and 25. In June (1959) the
figure had jumped to 42.6 per
cent. That is a startling per-
centage from an age-group
whose strength in the East
German population is 6.4 per
cent.”

look at the agenda then?” he
pleaded, with a bland air of
innocence.
“You certainly could not!”
said the Treasurer decisively.
“One line in the agenda would
be sufficient for you to write
a column.”
The badinage went on for a
few minutes, when the press-
man said in a casual way,
“Well, I suppose we are wel-
come to anything left on the
table?”
“Certainly,” said Sir George,
and turning to the individual
in question, he said, “Knowing
you of old, I have had all the
notes and other scrap pieces of
paper gathered up and they
are now in the incinerator!”
“Excellent,” said the journa-
list. “Then I suppose 1 can
have this blotting-paper as a
memento of this auspicious
occasion?” x
Sir George nodded, appar-
ently not thinking the reporter
was in earnest, but the reporter
promptly rolled up the folder
and put it in his pocket.
Next morning, the “Argus”
had a “scoop.” It was an
article outlining and discussing
the important subjects with
which the conference had to
deal.
Apparently one of the visit-
ing Treasurers had inadvert-
ently left his copy Of the
agenda in the folder, and the
reporter must have noticed
something there when he was
carelessly fiddling with it.
Granted it was a smart piece
of work, but it seemed, to my
simple way of thinking, that it
savored of the methods of the
secret spy. Government
Treasurers have to explore
many avenues in their search
for new sources of revenue or
to readjust the incidence of
taxation. Premature publica-
tion of nebulous proposals
could seriously disturb sections
of the business community and
private investments as well. It
is definitely against the
interests of the general com-
munity that the door should
thus be opened widely to
irresponsible speculation.
The conservative “Argus” of
the old days had a motto read-
ing: “I am in the place where
I am demanded by conscience
to speak the truth, and there-
fore the truth I speak, impugn
it whoso list.” It seemed in-
congruous that a paper with
such a high standard should
later have promoted this journa-
list to an important position,
but knowing the proprietors of
those days, I am sure they
did not know what a trickster
he was. When they did find
out, he was promptly sacked.
UNETHICAL SCOOPS AND
“THE LOUSY LIST"
Amore striking instance
of unethical methods of
obtaining scoops was
alleged to have been
resorted to by a well-known,
but not very popular, pressman
whom I shall refer to as
Sammy.
For a long time pressmen
had thought it strange that
Sammy should be able so often
to get wind of probable politi-
cal developments when it was
quite apparent that few Parlia-
mentarians had any time for
him. His reputation as a politi-
cal seer collapsed when Senator
Thomas Givens, President of
the Senate, as chairman of the
House Committee, abruptly
issued an order withdrawing all
Parliamentary press privileges
from inter-State journalists.
These privileges had included
access to the refreshment-
rooms and, when accompanied
by a member, to the tennis-
courts, cricket-pitch, billiard-
room and library. They could
also wander unmolested about
the Queen’s Hall, where mem-
bers gathered in groups to
discuss Parliamentary tactics
or to meet intimate political
supporters. Nor were they
excluded from some of the
corridors where political plots
were frequently hatched.
Indeed, a select few, who had
established reputations for
trustworthiness, could, when
caucus was not in session,
even walk into the party-room
to chat with members.
The reason for this revolu-
tionary and unprecedented
action by the House Committee
was the alleged discovery that
Sammy had procured his
scoops of inside political know-
ledge by secreting himself for
lengthy periods in a lavatory
frequented by Ministers and
other Parliamentary members
and officials.
I do not know what ground
there was for this charge,
but the evidence was apparently
sufficient to satisfy the House
Committee, comprising mem-
bers of both Houses of possibly
different political views. The
inter-State pressmen took
strong exception to the infer-
ence that they were nothing
better than a disreputable band
of eavesdroppers, when dis-
approval should have fallen
exclusively on the shoulders of
one man.
Smarting under this un-
deserved insult, two of the
inter-State men compiled a list
of the names of the House
Committee members. They
gave it the not vepy elegant
title “The Lousy List,” and
posted it on the notice-board
in the inter-State reporters’
press-room.
These two venturesome
pressmen, intent on upholding
the integrity of their reputable
fellows, were Quentin Spedding,
of the Sydney “Daily Tele-
graph,” and George Goddard
(jnr.), of the “Sydney Morn-
ing Herald.” They were out
to kill, and suggested to their
colleagues that all the mem-
bers whose names appeared
on the list should be “put in
Chancery.” In other words,
their speeches were not to be
reported. The result was that
for some time these members
never got a mention in any
inter-State paper.
Eventually Senator Givens,
having been given a tip by one
of the Parliamentary mes-
sengers, made a tour of inspec-
tion, in the course of which
he discovered, the black-list.
He immediately ordered its
removal and at the same time
demanded an apology.
Harry Peters, of the Sydney
“Daily Telegraph,” was leader
of the inter-State press-group,
and Spedding told me that it
was doubtful whether he knew
anything about the posting of
“The Lousy List.” Therefore
it came as a great surprise one
bright afternoon when Peters
arrived at Parliament House
to find that he and the other
inter-State men had been
barred from entry.
The shock was so great that
Peters, always calm, collected
and unexcitable, dropped the
cigarette that usually dangled
from his mouth, and stared
blankly at the official. He was
deeply hurt, having been a
highly respected and import-
ant figure in Federal Parlia-
mentary circles.
Informed what it was all
about, and that an apology
was demanded, Peters
recovered his cigarette and,
sitting down on the wind-
swept steps leading to the main
entrance at the top of Bourke
Street, promptly wrote an
apology on a slip of reporters’
copypaper. This was sent to
the President, who immediately
called the Senate to order and
announced that he had received
an apology.
The President proceeded to
read the apology, but Peters’s
penmanship was atrocious.

floundered along, but eventu-
ally gave-up in despair.
A typewriter was procured,
and Peters, still squatting on
the Parliamentary steps at the
top of Bourke Street, got to
work again. He was very
careful in the wording of the
apology that it should be effec-
tive but as dignified as possible.
This led him to make many
alterations, crossing out and
writing in.
When this was handed to
the President, he looked at it
hopelessly, attempted to read
it, but suddenly decided to get
out of his difficulty by
announcing that the apology
appeared to meet all require-
ments. On his recommenda-
tion, it was accepted and
ordinary press-relations were
resumed—but not all the
privileges were restored.
PRIME MINISTERS I KNEW
(1) Australia’s Noblest Son
At the inauguration of the
Commonwealth the duty
fell upon the first
Governor - General, the
Earl of Hopetown (afterwards
the Marquis of Linlithgow), to
appoint the first Federal
Cabinet, there being no
Federal Parliament in existence.
The field of selection seemed
naturally to indicate the
Premiers of the six States and
their leading Cabinet mem-
bers, but difficulty arose in the
case of N.S.W., the most
populous State, of which Sir
William Lyne was Premier.
The Governor-General felt
Constitutionally bound to com-
mission Lyne, but it soon
became known that the other
Premiers would prefer Sir
Edmund Barton, who had
fought for Federation over the
years and had been acclaimed
as “Australia’s noblest son.”
It was openly stated that they
would not serve under any
other leader.
Bitterly disappointed, Lyne
had to return his Commission,
and the Governor-General
promptly sent for Barton. A
press-friend of mine, Gerald
Mussen, “happened” to be in
Barton’s home at the time, in
anticipation of the news he was
sure would come in due
course.
The telephone rang. Barton’s
little girl burst excitedly into
the room and said “Dad!
Dad! It’s from Government
House! ”
Coming back from the
phone, Barton said, “It's from
Government House, all right;
I’ve been sent for.” Turning
to his young daughter he said,
“Give me my boots!”
It seemed such an anticlimax
to the tense situation that,
after a few seconds’ silent
pause in which they just looked
at each other, they both broke
into laughter somewhat
restrained, perhaps. Sir
Edmund had a keen sense of
humor.
The first Commonwealth
Cabinet comprised Sir Edmund
Barton as Prime Minister, Sir
William Lyne (N.S.W.), Alfred
Deakin (Vic.), Sir George
Turner (Vic.), Charles Cameron
Kingston (S.A.), James George
Drake (Q.), Richard Edward
O’Connor (S.A.), Sir John
Forrest (W.A.), and the Hon.
N. E. Lewis (Tas.). The last-
named resigned after a few
months and his place was taken
by Sir Phillip Oakley Fysh.
Sir James Dickson (Q.) had
also been selected, but he died
before he could be sworn-in.
Barton was a big man in
every sense of the term. When
I interviewed him on any
occasion I always had my note-
book handy, because what he
said was couched in such
perfect phraseology that any
loose reporting would do him
an injustice. In this respect the
present Prime Minister, R. G.
Menzies, often reminds me of
him.
Sir Edmund’s high sense of
public duty was exemplified
when the Cabinet decided to
create the High Court of Aus-
tralia. It was the unanimous
wish of his colleagues that he
should accept the position of
Chief Justice, but Sir Edmund,
although a lawyer of repute,
and noted for his knowledge
of Constitutional legalities,
hesitated for some days.
It transpired that he was
having Sir Samuel Griffith,
Chief Justice of Queensland,
quietly sounded as to whether
he would accept the position.
On receiving a favorable
response, and on finding that
the Federal Cabinet was pre-
pared to acquiesce, Sir Edmund
agreed to accept appointment
—but only as one of the six
justices to serve under Sir
Samuel.
Before Sir Edmund left the
political arena for the Bench
in 1903 the pressmen who had
been doing the Federal political
rounds since the beginning of
Federation gathered at his
office to congratulate him on
his appointment. In the course
of a gracefully worded acknow-
ledgment of the good wishes
of the reporters, Sir Edmund
whimsically remarked:
“Although my duties will
take me from a place where
pressmen never cease from
troubling and politicians are
never allowed to be at rest, to
a place with a calm judicial
atmosphere, where I may have
to see them under less-favorable
circumstances, I can make this
solemn promise, that if any
of you do appear before me
in my capacity as a judge, I
shall make certain that you get
all you deserve.”
Some time in 1943 I broad-
cast a few of my recollections
in the “Fifty-and-over” radio-
session. By next morning’s
mail I received a letter from
a very old and valued friend,
W. A. Newman (now no more
with us), in the course of which
he said •
“I appreciated your kindly
reference to Edmund Barton
Without doubt he was entitled
to the epithet ‘Australia’s
noblest son ’ I have known
a good many Prime Ministers,
but in my opinion Barton stood
alone. Maybe I was
nreiudiced as vmi know T came
f l Y K , am r
to Melbourne as a member of
Barton’s original staff. The
others were Atlee Hunt and
Gerald Whiteford.”
I know how highly Barton
appreciated the services of
these public officials. All
these three were, like Malcolm
Lindsay Shepherd, to whom
I shall refer later, admirable
examples of the perfect public
servant. They carried out
their onerous duties to the
public conscientiously, always
giving their political chiefs the
best that was in them.
I came in daily contact with
many of the same type in the
upper ranks of the Federal
service over the twenty years
of my journalistic activities in
the Federal political sphere,
and I feel that the occasional
remissness of a few is poor
justification for the carping
criticism one occasionally hears
about public servants as a
body.

with further intimate accounts of
Prime Ministers the author
personally knew.)

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Parliament and Press
The extent to which Parlia-
ment may be permitted to
govern the country is becom-
ing a matter for serious debate
in W.A., following the State
Parliament’s second decision
against granting Perth City
Council an area of King’s Park
as a site for an aquatic-centre.
The voting was 27 against,
18 for, with four absentees. Far
graver issues have been decided
by far smaller margins, and
the decisions have been
accepted; but now the pro-
tagonists of the pool in the
park are considering what
steps can be taken to force
Parliament to reverse its
decision, and they’re talking
about a referendum.
Probably no decision given
against sportsmen has ever
been so ungraciously received
or so arrogantly rejected. In
1957, after a spirited and
often bitter campaign, Parlia-
ment voted 29 to 14 against
the proposal.
The Perth City Council and
the city press immediately
campaigned for a reversal of
the decision. Opponents of the
scheme —who, incidentally, in-
cluded some members of the
City Council —were lampooned
by columnist and cartoonist;
their privately published state-
ments were vaguely claimed to
be inaccurate, and leading-
articles stated, without basis of
fact, that their arguments had
been demolished.
Even Sabrina, during her
visit to Perth, was given space
in one daily to support the
proposal, possibly because, as
one of the scheme’s opponents
said, she carried more weight
than the paper’s regular
columnist and it was distributed
better.
Within a few months of
Parliament’s rejection of the
proposal a Westralian visitor to
the Empire Games at Cardiff
stated publicly that at the
Empire Games at Perth in
1962 the swimmers would corn-
pete at an aquatic-centre in
King’s Park.
All possible pressure was
brought to bear on Parliament
to produce a change of mind.
The matter even became an
issue in the intervening elec-
tion, and the scheme’s spon-
sors hoped for some support in
the new Parliament. They
actually had less. The previous
(Labor) Cabinet had supported
the proposal; the present
(Liberal) Cabinet is almost
entirely opposed to it; and
the sponsors had difficulty in
arranging to have the matter
raised in Parliament.
Now it has been defeated
again. It’s most unlikely that
a referendum will be held, or
that it would succeed if it
were. Generally speaking, the
country districts oppose the
proposal, and less than two-
thirds of City Council rate-
payers could be expected to
support it they’re already
faced with a rise in rates of
about a fiver a year on an
average home, to pay for the
Games, and they fear a white-
elephant in the council’s
grandiose scheme.
In metropolitan districts
opinion is divided, as was
shown when a majority of local
authorities refused to endorse
a proposal that their associ-
ation support the council’s
plan. And if a referendum
did succeed, the matter would
still rest with the same Parlia-
ment which has rejected the
proposal.
The controversy should be
dropped now. The average
ratepayer and taxpayer isn’t
at all clear on how he’s going
to benefit from the hold-
ing of the Empire Games in
Perth ; and this dispute, easily
the most intense division of
opinion in the big State for
50 years, hasn’t increased
enthusiasm for the Games. To
be successful they’ll require a
united effort—and that won’t
be forthcoming while the row
lasts. — Pieter Nuyts (W.A.).
Middle East Refugees
Being neither a Jew nor an
Arab, and having read a lot of
the propaganda of both sides,
I feel that The Bulletin
(21 /10/’59) was a bit unfair to
Israel on the subject of
refugees—apart from the facts
that Israel has consistently
offered peace-treaties to all its
Arab neighbors, and offers out-
standing examples of how to
develop arid areas. .

state of Israel were not
“thrown out,” but left under
Arab pressure and in the face
of appeals and assurances by
Israel. Many Arabs, in fact,
remained and remain in Israel,
and have mostly prospered.
There are several Arabs in the
Knesset, or Parliament. Israel
has made many offers to co-
operate in solving the human
problem of the refugees, and
there seems little reason to
doubt the Israeli claim that the
Arab States (with one excep-
tion), instead of making use
of the manpower available
among these refugees, are
deliberately keeping them in a
state of poverty and degrada-
tion for propaganda purposes
among their own people and
in the U.N.
Plenty of non-Jews, includ-
ing U.N. observers of assured
impartiality, have reported to
this effect. Their testimony
should be more acceptable
than the ex parte arguments
by Arabs and Jews.
Also, there is no reason to
believe that Israel, now busily
and successfully cultivating
friendly relations with several
African and Asian nations, will
remain “a permanent sore in
the centre of the Arab world,”
or that the Arabs will continue
unfriendly when such law-
defying bombasts as Nasser are
finally sent packing, and some
sanity returns to Egypt.—
Charles Meeking (N.S.W-).
Writers and Classes
Many Australians will
endorse the criticism by Hugh
Hunt, director of the Aus-
tralian Elizabethan Theatre
Trust, of the recent tendency
of Australian playwrights to
concentrate on sordid themes
with, generally, proletarian
characters.
There is, of course, a place
for this type of play or novel
in a country’s literature, and,
as the success of “Summer of
the 17th Doll” showed,
one of them may, when good,
have a wide appeal. But when
that side of life is over-
emphasised, a false picture is
created of a society’s character.
The people in the various
“slice of life” dramas by con-
temporary Australian play-
wrights are not truly represen-
tative of our society. The
most representative social
elements in Australia today
are the middle-class and upper-
working-class suburbanites and
their rural counterparts.
These are very different in
outlook, manners and habits of
living from the types popular
with Australian writers. They
provide most of the “floating
vote” that decides who shall
“Myxomatosis ... Strontium 90 ... mousetraps —
you've got to learn to live with ’em.”
govern the country. From them
come also most of the many
leaders in business, the pro-
fessions, primary production,
science, the arts and letters
who were not born in rich
households.
Strangely, this important
section of the community is
ignored by most Australian
writers. Few. novels or plays
have had an urban middle-class
setting ; and, with such notable
exceptions as E. O. Schlunke
and David Campbell, the pros-
perous modern farming com-
munity has also been largely
neglected of late, rural
inspiration being still sought
mainly in the far outback.
This Australian attitude is
strikingly different from that in
Britain and America, where the
middle-class scene is very
popular among writers. —•

Faith In the
Future
\
»
One of the fruits of our present season of
expansion is that Australia seems set to enjoy
more of that American investment-interest which
until now has been directed chiefly to Canada and
South America.
That conclusion, formed on studies I made
during my visit abroad last year, has since been
strengthened by additional proofs of an evolution
that is working in world finance.
When the president of the New York Stock
Exchange, Mr. G. Keith Funston, was over here
recently, he referred to the inter-dependence of free
nations in supplying the world-wide demand for
“growth money.” He spoke of his country’s interest
in Australia’s remarkable economic development;
of America’s increasing dependence on other
nations in the carrying on of its own enormously
grown economy; of the new kind of American
investor who is prepared to support his confidence
in Australia and other countries with private
“venture capital.”
He described this type of investment by
millions of individuals as a new form of “People’s
Capitalism.” It is a source to which I believe we
now can look more earnestly and hopefully for the
financing of Australia’s development.
It is a characteristic of American investment
that the immediate yield need not be high, so long
as the. “risk” is sound and has within it the seeds
of potential.
Interest in Australia, however, extends well
beyond the U.S.A. It is reflected in Europe.
Britain is still the major overseas investor in this
country, and figures released from London have
shown that more British capital is flowing to
Australia than to any other country in the world.
Most heartening as this is, it puts a very
definite responsibility upon us here at home. While
welcoming investment from every good source and
allowing the conditions to encourage it, we need
to create more of our own capital in higher
production; and that includes self-in vestment in
the means by which production can be raised and
made more efficient.
In short, the confidence we inspire in others
rests finally in the faith we exhibit in ourselves.

“Farinmail” describes as “one
of the leading British historians
of today.”
Hammond’s The Village
Laborer may be prejudiced in
favor of those who were
scarcely mentioned in patriotic
history-books a few genera-
tions ago ; but even if we dis-
count half his evidence we must
still take account of Fox’s
remark in Parliament in the
closing years of the 18th
century that “the greater part
of the working-classes in this
country were lying at the
mercy, and almost living on the
charity, of the rich.” Anyhow,
as its name indicates, The
Village Laborer was not in-
tended as “a general picture of
conditions,” but to show how
the agricultural laborer fared.
In spite of Elizabeth W. Gil-
boy, I doubt that there was “a
rise in living-standards among
the English working-class in
the Napoleonic War period”
(1793-1815).
The wages of most urban
workers increased by 50 to 60
per cent., but so did the cost
of living, and agricultural
laborers’ wages were not in-
creased. If they were, why did
the laborers flock to the towns?
As “Farinmail” says, “it is
debatable whether most people
who took to thieving in those
days were primarily activated
by necessity.” We do know,
however, that there was an
extraordinary increase in crime
in the 18th century, and detec-
tion was surely about as
effective in 1700 as in 1800.
There were no police to speak
of, but there were coastguards,
gamekeepers, - the harshest
penal system in Europe and
the fact that (until 1836) a
man accused of a felony was
not allowed to employ counsel
to defend him in court.
It was not until 1770 that it
was found to be necessary to
introduce an Act against
poaching. A second Act,
passed in 1800, increased the
severity of the punishment,
indicating that the practice of
poaching had also increased.
Surely few, apart from the
desperately hungry, would
poach, knowing that imprison-
ment with hard labor
followed if they were caught?
Apparently many were des-
perately hungry, for in one
three-year period 8502 per-
sons were convicted of poach-
ing, and this represented one-
seventh of all criminal con-
victions in the country for this
period.
Smuggling was as popular
as present-day s.-p. betting, and
much more romantic. Its
appeal can be understood when
it is noted that the duty payable
on tea was 119 per cent, of its
value. Pitt the younger re-
duced this to 12} per cent., but
partly made-up for it by
placing a tax on windows!
Peel’s London Constabulary
of 1829 was not quite as effec-
tive as was hoped in protecting
property from the majority
who didn’t have any. It
covered only London and
the suburbs, and it was not
until 1856 that a police
system covered the whole of
England.—B. E. D. (N.S.W.).
N.T. on the Move
A press-release by the
Minister for Territories, dated
October 16, shows that Aus-
tralia’s “forgotten sixth” is
really on the move. The
Minister said that deposits in
the three savings-banks operat-
ing in the Northern Territory
had increased since 1954 by
79.4 per cent. In 1954 there were
9000 savings-bank accounts
in the N.T. with total balances
of £1,333,000. On August 1
this year there were 14,000, and
depositors’ balances totalled
£2,391,000.
I can remember the time,
only 30 years ago, when such
balances did not total £250,000.
In those days there were but
two banks in Darwin (the
E., S. and A. and the Common-
wealth) and none at Alice
Springs or Tennant Creek.
Now there are six trading-
banks in Darwin, four at Alice
Springs and one at Tennant
Creek, with various agencies at
Peko Mines, Nobels Nob,
Katherine and Rum Jungle.
The Commonwealth also has a
branch at Batchelor. Custom
Credit, the big hire-purchase
concern, has just opened a full
branch in Darwin; and
Esanda, the E„ S. and A. hire-
purchase subsidiary, is repre-
sented at Darwin, Alice Springs
and Tennant Creek.
Banks today don’t open
branches on the off-chance of
picking-up a paying business
after a year or two. It’s too
costly to open anywhere unless
the directors are completely
satisfied with the prospects.
Savings-banks are used
largely by farmers with surplus
cash and by thrifty wage-
earners. Perhaps the release of
the above mentioned figures
will stimulate a bit more
interest in the Territory among
members of the big political
parties. It might even induce
them to agree to the construc-
tion of rail-communication
with Darwin. —D. C. Tilghman
(N.S.W.).


THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
WHY PITY THE DAIRYFARMER?
From “P.H.R.”
In countries like Denmark,
Sweden, Holland and Eng-
land a dairyfarmer is the most
esteemed and respected mem-
ber of the agricultural com-
munity. In Australia it’s the
opposite. Beef - raisers pity
him; sheepmen scorn him ;
wheatfarmers look on dairy-
cows as the last resort.
In the great Australian
capital cities the newspapers
are invariably hostile to him.
They lose no opportunity to
pander to the popular con-
ception of the dairyfarmer as
a lazy, inefficient moron who
adds water to his milk, mal-
treats his animals and never
stops growling about some-
thing or other. So much so,
that by now half the dairying
community itself is prepared
to believe the untrue things
said about dairyfarmers—while
accepting the colossal annual
handout under the conscience-
saver that it’s really a con-
sumer subsidy.
The world consumption
of wool in the first
quarter of 1959 is
estimated to have risen
by about 1 per cent.,
compared with the
previous quarter. How-
ever, consumption on
a daily-rate basis, com-
pared with the first
quarter of 1959 showed
there was an increase
of some 6 per cent.
Lambing losses occa-
sioned by fly-strike, set-
back and similar
diseases may be con-
siderably reduced with
the use of Elastrator
Rubber Rings for all
Marking and Tailing.
That is why successful
sheep-owners use and
recommend Elastrator,
the safe, sure and
humane method of
Castration and Tailing.
All this being so, let’s have
a look at the true position and
explode a few chronic mis-
conceptions about dairying.
Dairying is not a game for
mugs. To run a dairyfarm a
man needs to be farmer,
grazier, mechanic, business-
man, agronomist and vet. It’s
“Know a good cure for corns , lady?”
mighty handy if he can use
a saw-bench, handle horses,
lift a cornsack and be some-
thing of a plumber, welder,
carpenter, builder and weather-
expert into the bargain.
Cows are not stupid. In
some ways they show a deal
more sense than some human-
beings I know, and they con-
tribute far more to the good
of mankind. A cow rates as
one of the most intelligent
animals, far above the horse
and second only to the pig,
dog, elephant and some mon-
keys. Once you’ve allowed
for her strongly developed
herd-instincts and love of
regular habits, you’ll find her
friendly, responsive and co-
operative.
Cows are clean. Properly
cared for, they have no body
parasites. Fleas and lice are
strictly for dogs and sheep.
Nothing so unsavory as fly-
strike worries them. On the
delicate question of soiled
dairy-floors, the dairyfarmer
is usually more to blame than
the cow. Although a little
absentminded on such per-
sonal matters, she can be
trained. It is only when she
is upset that she forgets her
manners. But, then, who
doesn’t? though we may
express ourselves differently!
Dairying needn’t be seven-
day-a-week slavery. Plenty of
dairyfarmers have come to an
arrangement with their men or
their neighbors so that they
can have at least a day off
each week and a holiday every
year. One neighbor milks both
herds while the other goes
fishing or shopping—depend-
ing on whether he’s single or
married.
Dairyfarmers in general are
not underpaid. Some are
grossly overpaid and others
don’t get enough. But this
happens in any type of busi-
ness. There is no need for
sympathy for the man who
can’t make ends meet year
after year. He isn’t forced to
stay. If he doesn’t like what
he’s doing he can take a job
on a property or in a country
town, or move to the city. Or
keep quiet about it!
Again, dairying families
aren’t slaves. Helping in the
dairy isn’t slavery, even for
kids. If they’re handled right,
it’s usually a job to keep them
out. The man who consis-
tently uses his kiddies to work
for him for long periods is
lazy or inefficient, or both, and
should be doing something
else.
Dairying is never dull. Not
if a man is awake to the
funny and interesting things
going on around him. No two
days are quite alike, and every
milking is a miracle.
So the milk-game isn’t a 9
black as it’s painted. In other
ways, too, it has the edge on
other types of farming. First,
it’s secure, because milk,
butter and cheese are always
in demand and, in any case,
the price-structure is stabilised.
Secondly, the cheques come in
once a month, so a man doesn’t
have to wait a whole year to
be paid. Thirdly, he doesn’t
have to keep slaughtering his
stock to get an income from
them. It’s not a bloodthirsty
occupation. A man comes to
regard his livestock as old
friends and individuals.
Fourthly, dairying is usually
carried-on in pleasant, closely-
settled country. With neigh-
bors nearby, you get more
social contacts, more fun.
Lastly, the dairyfarmer can
have the goal of intensive
farming in mind. There is
almost no limit to the improve-
ment possible within a fixed
acreage. To sum-up, the dairy-
farmer in Australia is a man
to be admired and envied.
Q.A.H.S. and C.
“Hop Scrub”: The Q.A.H.S.
and C. —or, to give it its full
title, the Queensland Agricul-
tural High School and College
—is located in the Lockyer
Valley, where rich alluvial soils
and black-soil flats produce
heavy crops of potatoes, onions,
leaf-vegetables, lucerne and
cereal crops. Dairying is
general towards the foothills
there, with wooded slopes pro-
viding grazing and shelter for
cattle. Lucerne under irriga-
tion gives five or six cuts a
year.
The college-buildings are on
a sandstone ridge from which
the land slopes north towards
the Lockyer Creek and south
to the black-soil plains along
the Brisbane - Toowoomba
railway.
A surprise-packet in size to
visitors from other States, the
College has more diploma
students than any other Aus-
tralian agricultural college-
-303 were in residence this year.
The Agricultural High School
is integrated with the College
for the use of land and equip-
ment, though with a separate
academic staff. Boys are drawn
from country districts where
they are unable to attend high-
schools. They enter at 14, after
the scholarship-examination,
and stay two years, taking
their junior public examination
at the end. Besides academic

subjects, they learn agriculture,
animal-husbandry and horti-
culture.
Diploma-courses in animal-
husbandry and horticulture
were started in 1929 and 1931
respectively. Probably the
majority of juniors return to
the farms and stations at the
end of their first two years,
having acquired a good general
education and a basic know-
ledge of the various subjects.
The wider diploma-training
caters for the State’s varied
agrarian production, and
students can go on to Queens-
land University in the faculties
of agriculture or veterinary-
science.
The College has a total area
of 2400 acres, including a sub-
dairyfarm at Laidley; 1200
acres are under cultivation to
a large range of crops—
lucerne, summer and winter
cereals, potatoes, pumpkins,
maize, fruit and vegetables. It
is the centre of the hybrid-
maize project of 12,000 bushels
of seed a year for commercial
production by farmers. There
is an orchard along Lockyer
Creek, with citrus and decidu-
ous fruit-trees, and vegetables
are also grown nearby to pro-
vide instruction for students in
all phases of cultural care.
To enable boys to see com-
mercial production throughout
the State, tours of the Darling
Downs, Stanthorpe, Nambour
and the sugar-producing areas
are arranged annually. The 350
acres under irrigation from
wells and the creek cover every
aspect from “border”-flooding
of pastures and lucerne to the
use of spray-units.
Students number 907, and
30 from overseas have under-
taken courses there as well.
The College, originally
known as Gatton College, was
founded in 1897 with 24
students, Professor E. M.
Shelton, of Kansas (U.S.A.),
being its first principal. In
1923 control passed from the
Department of Agriculture and
Stock to that of Public Instruc-
tion (now the Department of
Education). J. K. Murray,
subsequently first Professor of
Agriculture at the University
of Queensland and Adminis-
trator of New Guinea, was in
charge until 1946, being suc-
ceeded by N. W. Briton.
The College has established
an Arab stud and gained a
number of places for its entries
at the Brisbane Royal. It
also runs small studs of Poll
Shorthorn and Brahman
cattle. An experimental pro-
gramme in beef-production on
improved pastures is being
tried in co-operation with the
C.5.1.R.0.
Indeed, all who know the
Q.A.H.S. and C. are certain
it will live up to the title
former Governor Sir Leslie
Orme Wilson gave its
“Queensland’s finest educa-
tional institution.”
Minerals
“Bilwon”: The dry seasons
we have been getting could
cause a lack of those minerals
needed by dairy-stock.
Milking-cows, the first to
suffer, need calcium and phos-
phorus to build bone and make
milk. A cow may milk off
its back into the bucket, but
suffers for it later and fails to
get into calf. Bones become
brittle and fracture easily.
Many cows are poisoned as
they rummage in rubbish-
dumps and round sheds,
licking-out tins and chewing
old rags in an endeavor to get
their ration of minerals.
During long dry-spells most
cattle are kept alive on dry
grass and hay. Both lack
phosphorus, although they may
contain all the calcium the
cow wants. On the other
hand, if the cattle are fed a
ration of grain, calcium may
be light-on.
It has been proved that
dairy-cows need one part of
phosphorus to every 400 parts
of dry-matter in their feed.
Much the same applies to
calcium.
A phosphorus-deficiency can
be overcome by feeding bone-
flour as a lick or in the ration.
Where the cows are fed on
dry grass and unchaffed hay,
a lick will be best for getting
the mineral into them. They
may turn up their noses at
first, but as the craving
develops they will eat all they
want and more.
In most districts dry pasture
and hay will supply all the
calcium cows need. If they
are drinking “hard” under-
ground water the calcium in
that will help, too. But if
stock are being kept alive on
a ration of grain it’s time to
start thinking about a calcium-
supplement. Ground-limestone
is ideal. A 2 per cent, addition
of limestone to the grain will
give the cow all the calcium
it is likely to want.
There are few districts where
cows need salt. Mostly, they
get all they want from the
pastures, and “hard” water
will give them a small ration
every time they take a fill at
the trough. But in long
droughts valuable stock may
be stall-fed on concentrates to
keep them alive. Then it’s a
good plan to add 1 per cent,
salt to the grain-ration. Salt
is cheap and perks-up the
appetite at a time when the
cattle are being fed in unusual
conditions.
Overfeeding
“Mick O’Night”: Not long
ago a grazier in the eastern
Riverina district (N.S.W.) was
told by one of his men that,
going to feed the best bull
that morning, he’d found it
lying apparently dead, flat on
its back, with its legs in the
air. The bull was very fat, but
with a great effort they rolled
it over on to its side. Setting
about working the bull’s legs
and massaging round its
brisket, they gradually brought
it back to consciousness,
although it was some hours
before it could get up.
What had happened was that
they had overfed the bull on
concentrates and crushed grain
the night before. When this
griped—as had happened on a
previous occasion—the bull
had evidently rolled onto its
back to ease the pain. Once
there, it couldn’t get 6ack on its
side again, and the owner said
that when he saw it first the
bull was almost dead. He put

of this tale is: be careful not
to overfeed concentrates or

Bulking Poultry-feed
“Rodger”: The Barnes
Milling Co. at Warwick is the
first in Queensland to bulk
poultry - feed. Special equip-
ment, made by a local engineer,
loads the pelleted food into
trucks which convey it direct
to bulk-tanks on poultry-
farms.
Bulking has many advan-
tages, among them the saving
on bags, which, of course, is
why many wheatfarmers are
turning to bulk. On a big
wheatfarm this saving alone
can amount to £2OOO a year.
Add bag-sewing, at the rate
of £2 or more a hundred, and
it’s no wonder bulking is
becoming popular. Even the
apple-men in Queensland are
installing bulking equipment.
For Tropics and
Sub-Tropics
“Hop Scrub”: The produc-
tion in a Queensland nursery
of an apple which will grow r
and fruit in the coastal districts
of Queensland and N.S.W. may
solve a problem of long stand-
ing.
The variety named
Tropical Beauty, with Rome
Beauty as one of its parents —
is a red-striped fruit, 6oz. to
Boz. in weight, hard and crisp,
of good flavor and eating-
quality. It has low “chilling
requirements,” and under
coastal conditions is practically
evergreen. In Queensland the
tree flowers in August and the
fruit ripens in late January.
Interpollination information
has not yet been determined,
but, since apples are all inter-
fertile, a contemporaneous
bloomer of good commercial
type should be adequate.
Though this apple has been
produced primarily for sub-
tropical and tropical climates,
it might prove a good “early”
for conventional apple-
districts. For N.S.W. coastal
districts, it should surpass those
grown at present.
Squirter
“Musa”: Squirter, a disease
of the banana, is difficult to
detect until the fruit is almost
ripe. When a banana is affected
by the disease its pulp decom-
poses, and if the fruit is
squeezed it will squirt a dark
liquid out of the stalk-end or
the side.
In early stages an area of
rotting tissue lies along the
centre of the fruit, usually
connecting with the stalk.
This tissue, which has a dark,
water-soaked appearance, is
caused by a fungus (Nigrospora
sphcerica ) which forms on dying
leaf-bases, bunch-spathes and
other dead material, like old
banana-stalks and rotting fruit.
Spores from the fungus are
blown about and settle on
clean bunches. When fruit is
removed from the stalk these
spores enter through the cut
and travel down the vascular
fibres, causing rot.
The disease occurs during
the cooler months, normally
between May and November.
Quick ripening reduces the
seriousness of the disease and
strict hygiene in the plantation
and the packing-shed will help
to keep down the number of
spores present. Remove the
bunch-spathe and all trash
round Ihe bunches while they
are on the palms, and burn all
waste fruit and bunch-stalks.
Spray the packing-shed with
formalin at 5 per cent, strength
to control the spores.
Squirter can be controlled
by disinfecting the fruit with
a fungicide known as sali-
cylanamide. Use this prepara-
tion at the dilution-rate recom-
mended on the container, add-
ing a wetting- and spreading-
agent to the solution to make
it adhere to the fruit. Imme-
diately bananas are severed
from the stalk immerse them
in the solution for half-a-minute
or so before packing.
Dieback of Pawpaws
“Belar”: Dieback, a serious
disease of pawpaws, can cause
heavy loss of bearing trees.
Its first symptom is a light-
brown, water-soaked area,
usually about sin. across, on
the edge of one of the crown-
leaves. This gradually shrivels
and dies, and the rest of the
leaf becomes affected and
drops-off. Where the leaf-stalk
joins the trunk a.lesion appears,
which turns brown and dries
into a hard, superficial scab.
Other crown-leaves and the
stem, for about 3ft. from the
apex, also die. The older
leaves turn yellow, and after
a few weeks fall to the ground.
Any full-grown fruit, becom-
ing wrinkled and flabby, soon
drop off.
Dieback generally affects
isolated trees throughout the
summer. Favorable weather-
conditions may cause outbreaks
over a wide area, but severity
varies between districts and
even from farm to farm in
affected areas.
No parasitic organism has
been found in the crowns of
affected plants, so it’s probable
that some general disturbance
in the health of trees causes
the trouble. Failure of the
roots to absorb sufficient mois-
ture for the plant’s needs may
lead to breakdown in the
young, tender tissues of the
crown. After spells of wet
weather dieback may be
severe wherever a fairly com-
pact subsoil lies close to the
surface, while trees growing on
gravelly or stony soil are prac-
tically free from the trouble.
There’s no chemical remedy
for dieback, but precautions
will minimise the disease.
Land which is badly drained
or has a clay subsoil close to
the surface should be avoided,
and plenty of organic matter
should be worked into the soil,
with a sprinkling of lime added.
If possible, improve the drain-
age, too. As soon as the
disease is noticed, cut the trunk
back to within 3ft. from the
ground to encourage the
growth of side-shoots. Should
these already be present, cut
the trunk off 9in. above the
highest, making the cut at one
of the partitions, and placing
a tin over it, to prevent rain
entering and causing rot.
Leguminous Pasture
“Wimra”: Of nine samples
entered in the Dimboola (Vic.)
Senior Young Farmers’ Club
wheat-quality competition last
season, the two from crops
grown on a fallow-wheat rota-
tion averaged a protein-
content of 7.8 per cent. The
winning sample’s 12 per cent,
of protein, and the second-
prize one’s 10.9 per cent.,
lifted the average of the other
seven samples from crops on a
three-year rotation to 9.3 per
cent., even though one or two
samples were disappointingly
low in protein.
It was evident, however,
that these low-protein samples
were from land where soil-
fertility had been seriously
depleted by intensive cropping
before the adoption of a three-
year rotation. The leguminous
pasture, though it had cer-
tainly increased crop-yield, was
not yet strong enough to
restore soil-fertility.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(22/10/’59)
Queensland should have general rains during November,
heaviest in the north and central coastal districts and the
central- and south-western areas, where flooding may occur.
Reasonably good rains should fall in December.
N.S.W. should receive general rains during November,
with heaviest falls on the n.-w. slopes and plains and the
central tablelands, and in the central- and south-western
districts. Flooding may occur in much of the State.
Moderate to good rains are indicated in December, with
heavy falls in the south-coastal, southern tablelands and
south-west slopes areas.
Victoria can expect fairly heavy general rains and flood-
ing during November, with heaviest falls in the east-central
and north-eastern districts. Moderate to good rains should
be received in December.
South Australia should have good rains in November,
although falls may be patchy in December, apart from
moderate rain in the upper and lower north.
The agricultural areas of Western Australia should
have good rains in November, although falls may be poor
elsewhere.

Swine-brucellosis
“Rodger”: Worth noting
that swine-brucellosis (con-
tagious abortion), is both
infectious and chronic. There
are several strains, and it
attacks cattle and goats, as well
as pigs. Unfortunately, the
cattle- and goat-types also
attack the pigs.
Bringing an infected animal
to a clean farm is the usual
way of introducing the disease.
If the trouble-maker is a sow,
the discharge, loaded with the
brucella organism, will be
scattered over the ground and
healthy pigs will be infected
through the mouth or through
cuts and scratches on the skin.
If a boar is the culprit, healthy
sows will be infected.
The way sows react to the
disease varies. Some carry their
litters full-time and give birth
to weak, scraggy piglets, many
of which die before 1 they are
weaned, while others contract
pneumonia, because of lowered
resistance. Other sows lose
their litters so early that the
abortion may pass unnoticed,
and the first inkling that any-
thing is wrong is the sow’s
return to the boar. Apart from
the danger of these sows infect-
ing a healthy boar, they may
become sterile and have to be
sold —but after the damage has
been done.
Infected boars may become
sterile. Most boars carry the
infection right through life, but
some eventually gain a toler-
ance to the disease which
permits them to breed again.
Never actually cured, however,
they are always a danger,
especially when in contact
with healthy sows.
Abortion in cattle is being
fought with Strain 19 vaccine,
and results have been encourag-
ing. Unfortunately, no vaccine
to cure pigs has yet been
discovered.
A blood-test at a veterinary
laboratory may pinpoint the
animals that react to the
disease, though a single test
may be misleading. Sometimes
a sow or boar will give a
negative test on the first run
and positive later on. Several
tests must be made to get a
clear picture.
There being no cure, if the
piggery is free from brucellosis
the only hope is to keep it
that way by testing all pigs
brought to the property. This
means buying boars only from
disease-free studs. If the
disease is already in the sties,
call a vet. and see what can
be done. Probably the first
step will be a blood-test for
all pigs to determine the extent
of the infection; after that,
segregation of healthy pigs and
culling of all affected.
Traditional Breeds?
[From “The Review of the River
Plate,” Buenos Aires.]
traditional cattle-breeds
in Argentina have a
common characteristic: preco-
cious development. The growth
of the bone-structure of the
animal is completed at a rela-
tively early age hence its
shortness of stature —and once
this stage is reached the food
which is no longer required for
bone-formation is assimilated
in other ways.
One of these, of course, is
flesh-formation, but, because
of the reduced size of the
skeletal frame and the fact
that flesh is necessarily pro-
portionate to bone, the intake
of food beyond a certain stage
in the development-process
results in a high rate of fat-
formation.
Consequently, if our cattle
are to supply leaner beef they
will have to be slaughtered
very much earlier than at
present. This would not be so
if, for example, the Argentine
herds were composed mainly
of dairy-breeds instead of the
beef-cattle which we have
specialised in, since the dairy-
breeds, in which the growth
of the bone - structure tends
to be a longer process,
give leaner meat even in the
case of the heavier and older
animals.
It is for this reason that, in
many countries today, the
dairy-breeds are favored as
beef-producers. It is also why
the beef-yielding possibilities
of the larger-built cattle —e.g.,
the hitherto neglected
Charolais —are being carefully
and expertly studied.
This tendency towards a pre-
ference for dairy-cattle as a
source of beef-supply is
regarded as one dictated by
necessity in the densely popu-
lated countries, from which it
is principally reported. It is
certainly one that cannot be
ignored in Argentina, still less
resisted by Argentine cattle-
producers, since in any market
it is incumbent on the supplier
to see that the consumer gets
the type of product he wants.
There is, of course, no diffi-
culty about supplying lean
meat from the essentially beef-
producing herds that Argentina
has traditionally specialised in,
always provided that the
slaughtering-age is kept low-
enough. Nor should this latter
stipulation present any diffi-
culty if the numbers of breed-
ing-stock are high enough to
ensure and maintain the neces-
sary supply of young steers
and calves.
Unfortunately, however, one
of the most disquieting aspects
of the present Argentine cattle-
crisis is precisely the shortage
of breeding-animals—a result,
this, of the inordinately heavy
rate of slaughter that was a
feature of this sector of the
cattle-market returns until
recently. For the time being,
therefore, the possibility of in-
creasing export-deliveries of
lean beef must, it seems, be
ruled out.
There remains the other
course: the adoption of other
types of cattle more suited to
the exigencies of this new situ-
ation by which the cattle-
raising industry is faced. This,
however, will be a matter of
careful and expert study and
one on which no hasty or hap-
hazard decision should be
taken.
At a meeting convened by
the Instituto Nacional de
Technologia Agropecuario
(1.N.T.A.) this matter was dis-
cussed in the light of the action
that might be taken. From the
information afforded of these
discussions it is satisfactory
to learn that plans are being
made for conducting an ex-
haustive technical inquiry into
the possible advantages that
might accrue from the adop-
tion and propagation in
Argentina of new cattle-types.
It was for experimental work
connected with this inquiry that
specimens of cattle-breeds
hitherto scarcely known in
Argentina were recently pur-
chased abroad and are now
being imported.
Normally, however, the final
results of such studies are only
arrived at after protracted
experimentation, and it may be
doubted whether the problem
is not already too urgent for
vital decisions on the future
orientation of Argentine cattle-
farming to be so long deferred.

one of the 99 islands in the
Clarence, where Government
workmen a year or so back
blew-up 22,000 tons of rock in
a single blast to provide
material for building the deep-
sea port at Iluka, opposite to
where Captain Matthew
Flinders anchored for several
days without discovering that
the harbor was the mouth of
a great river!
And then, again, there was
the ghost of Mr. Wilson peep-
ing out at me.
This Mr. Wilson was a
cheeky kind of bushranger,
who, with - a gang of very rude
fellows, lifted valuables from
travellers and stay-at-homes
indiscriminately, while poking
pistols under their noses and
pronouncing the magic pass-
word, “Bail-up!” in a loud
voice, all the way from Port
Phillip to Moreton Bay
(according to the dossier made-
out for him by the Historical
Society).
On one holiday trip the
Wilson gang found their
horses a bit slower than they
should be when pursued by
the police, so they paid a visit
to a station in the Grafton
district where there were some
good gallopers, and rode the
best of them away, leading the
horses on which they had
arrived.
But a gentleman in a choker
and cravat, Commissioner
Oliver Fry, sent the troopers
of the Border Police hotfoot,
loaded with orders and rifles,
to bring the horses and Mr.
Wilson and his mates back and
put them in jail. There was
a flogging-bench and a fellow
from New trained in
the use of the cat-o’-nine-tails
waiting for them.
However, sad to tell, the
troopers of the Border Police
were duck-soup for gentlemen
of Mr. Wilson’s kidney. He
took their horses from them,
and their rifles, and sent them
back on foot all the way from
Bellingen, 40 miles, to Grafton
(otherwise Woolport), with a
message to deliver to the man
in the choker and cravat which
I regret to say The Bulletin
would not print.
Mr. Wilson was shot long
afterwards by police on Yugil-
bar station, and Mr. Fry, who
had been seeking an oppor-
tunity for two years, never got
him on his sights, though in
other days he blew a hole in
the torso of Georgie, a rival
of Mr. Wilson, who was firing
at the commissioner from
behind a tree, and carelessly
exposed a little of himself to
the eager view of the commis-
sioner, who was a crack shot
with a rifle.
/ r 'VF a different order alto-
gether there is the shade
of Thomas Bawden, land-
owner and part-time lecturer
on the history of the Clarence,
who tells you, among other
lively anecdotes, of the first
Premier of New South Wales
under responsible Government,
Sir Stuart Alexander Donald-
son, who, in the days before
he was knighted, owned
Tenterfield station, and visited
it periodically, travelling by
sea to Grafton and then over
the ranges.
Staying at Eatonswill station,
on the Clarence, Bawden was
informed that there was a very
wild bullock in the yard.
Having been in Spain and seen
bullfights, he offered to fight
the bullock, and entered the
yard, armed with a pointed
stick and wearing a red shirt.
The bullock objected. The
red shirt emerged from a
cloud of dust on the horns of
the bullock, but the matador
was rescued.
r T~'HE shades within the
•*- society’s walls are legion,
and certainly varied. Henry
Searle looks down from his
picture on the south wall, and
what’s left of the boat in which
he was champion sculler lies
handy in a glass-case to pro-
tect it from souvenir-hunters.
Dr. Rowland T. Trail, M.D.,
Edinburgh, who came here in
1841 and set-up practice in a
round hut at Grafton, on the
bank of the river, tells you he
earned total fees of a fiver and
a boat (instead of cash) in
the first year at his profession
there; so he gave the game
away and took-over the
management of Tenterfield
and Clifton stations for Mr.
Donaldson, not suspecting that
his boss was to be Premier.
The doctor prospered as a
woolgrower. He is credited
with having named Tenterfield
after his birthplace in Scot-
land.
One of the big squatters who
haunt the pages is Mr.
Charles Grant Tindal, who
had many adventures while
working as a jackeroo for the
Ogilvies at Yugilbar and at
their Hunter River station,
Merton, and as a big grazier
on his own account.
The yarn connected with
him that I liked best was the
one about the clothing of the
naked aborigines who visited
the station when friendly rela-
tions had been established.
The station ladies objected to
the entire lack of clothing, and
insisted that at least some
articles of wear should be
worn when the darkies came
to the homestead seeking
favors. One morning Mr.
Tindal strolled out of the
house for a breath of fresh
air before breakfast, to be
greeted by the sight of a stal-
wart warrior, sitting proudly
on a stump in the yard, “fully
dressed.” His wardrobe con-
sisted of a hat, a collar and
a pair of boots.
And there is the shade of
a wise gold-commissioner
of the Peel River, who in the
days of the rushes in the
’fifties had to see that every
fossicker after gold had a
licence, for which he had to
pay 30s. a month.
This was Mr. Commissioner
Innes (the same after whom
Glen Innes was named); he
had been a major in the army
of the Duke of Wellington,
and had retired. When the
unsuccessful diggers could not
find the 30-bob a month the
major didn’t start another
Eureka. He issued the licences
on tick, and trusted them to
pay when they struck gold.
He reported that very few of
them failed to do so.
Another was the Rev.
Mr. Selwyn, who ministered
to the spiritual needs of the
wicked, some of them so tough
that when the flogger released
them from the tree, bleeding
and gasping, they uttered no
cries, but spat in his face to
show their contempt!
Mr. Selwyn was the son of
an English churchman and
married the daughter of one
His first eight years in New
South Wales were spent as a
cattleman on the Darling and
Namoi Rivers, in the ’fifties
When he married he decided
to become a clergyman' and
give-up station life, so he went
to Moreton Bay and studied
theology there in a church
which was formerly a stable
Then he served in the Grafton
end of the diocese when the
mails to Brisbane were carried
on packhorses.
A ltogether the Clarence
River pioneers were men
who had come to stay, and
who defied the efforts of the
elements, bad markets, un-
skilled Governments and every
other hazard to drive them
away, and while they were
taking and holding their for-
tunes from a reluctant,
untamed land, they had their
fun and leisure. For instance,
they bred an early Melbourne
Cup winner, Zulu (1881), and
the river produced, in Henry
Searle, the finest sculler of
his time (he won the world
championship in London in
1889).
They built their own ships
on the river-banks; yoked
together bullocks and horses
in the drays that took away
the wool ; formed their own
water - brigades for rescues
when the river came down in
flood ; mined the country for
gold, copper and tin; and
when they were short of coin
printed their own substitutes
in the form of “Calabash”
orders, known elsewhere as
“shin-plasters.”
And they made of a wild
country a white man’s garden ;
a valley of plenty and beauty.

"THE LADY" GOES STEREO
/""'oronet has at last issued a'
stereo pressing of My Fair
Lady (KLLS 1620), and it’s
really something. It was
recorded nine months ago in
London’s Drury Lane Theatre
by the original cast.
The most significant thing
about it is the sense of
“spread,” giving you at all
times an illusion of stage-space.
It is like having unseen actors
in your living-room, and with
a little bit of luck it’s easy
enough to imagine they are
really there, and how they
actually look. And the prin-
ciples of balanced stereo
—spread, sensible separa-
tion, increased clarity, virtual
absence of the “scream” regret-
tably noticeable on some
hi-fi sets when the volume is
and a more deeply
dimensioned listening-area—
translate happily in this most
happy musical.
This added gloss merely
enhances what has become
a sort of 20th-century phe-
nomenon in the field of
stage-musicals. It is almost
universally popular. In the
“Rain in Spain” number
the stereo - process most
properly splits the sound
into two clearly defined sources,
so that you get an impression
of stage-space between Prof.
Higgins and Eliza, and this
becomes a lesson in both pro-
nunciation and clarity of re-
production.
But, no doubt because the
company by now is pretty
familiar with the work, there
are differences between this
version and the original mon-
aural pressing. Not startling
differences ; just little things:
studied care with certain words,
and what might be called
inspired deliberation in the
orchestral part. “With a Little
Bit of Luck,” for instance, is
much clearer, and no longer is
there any doubt about that
glorious word “bloodhound,”
which triumphantly describes
the wife. In the original press-
ing, too, Holloway slipped-up
in the words “wife’s poor
heart”: he pluralised “heart,”
which seemed rather an exces-
sive thing to do. He has seen
the error of his tribute, and
on this disk he sets things
right.
Both in “Ascot Gavotte,”
that lilting demonstration of
staccato, leaning lightheartedly
to Haydn and Mozart, and in
“You Did It,” wherein “Buda-
pest rhymes with “ruder pest,”
there is very good separation ;
and Stanley Holloway throws
that splendid lecherous chuckle
just before he starts singing
“Get Me to the Church on
Time” with as much zest as
in the monaural release.
Anyone unable to get to
Melbourne to see the show
might drop-in on someone
owning a stereo-outfit, and
Julie Andrews, Rex Harrison,
Stanley Holloway and the mob
will do their stuff on an in-
visible stage between the
speaker-cabinets—for free.
A. W.
Waltzes and a March
Five years ago Richard
Rodgers was asked to conduct
the New York Philharmonic
Symphony Orchestra in a pro-
gramme of his music at Car-
negie Hall in aid of the
orchestra’s pension-fund. His
concert packed the hall, and
later Coronet made an 1.-p.
record of selections from the
programme, sales of which also
went to benefit the fund.
Now, on a 45, comes a selec-
tion of the selections: four
waltzes, beginning with
“Lover,” from the Rodgers-
Hart period (1931) and coming
down to the Rodgers-Hammer-
stein triumph, “Oh, What a
Beautiful Mornin’” (1943).
And, to finish the disk (KEP
188), the “March of the Siamese
Children,” from “The King
and I.” Good Rodgers. Good
orchestra. Good cause. Good
work!

A Coronet 45 r.p.m. disk
(KS-349) has Louis Armstrong
and his All Stars celebrating
the return to town of “Mack
the Knife.” Armstrong’s
husky approach makes it hard
to decipher all the words in
this fascinating bit of beat-
playing, but Mack apparently
slips a knife into someone.
Near the end you hear the
injunction “Take it, Satch !”
—and this is the signal for
some lyrical trumpet-playing.
The number on the reverse-
side, “Back O’ Town Blues,”
has a rhythm much slower,
but nearly as captivating,
about it.

The founder of the English Speaking
Union, Sir Evelyn Wrench, was among
the guests when the Governor, Sir Dallas
Brooks, declared open the new extended
premises attached to English Speaking
House in Toorak Road, South Yarra.
As well as Sir Dallas, E.S.U. president
Sir Owen Dixon, deputy-president Mr.
Justice Sholl, and Sir Evelyn Wrench
were in fine fettle, with every speech
short, witty and amusing. Lady Brooks
looked attractive in floating grey chiffons
highlighted with pastel-blue satin trim-
mings. By a happy coincidence it was
also Sir Evelyn’s birthday, so he was
presented with a gift. The E.S.U. also
got a present in the form of a portrait
of Sir Evelyn, painted by Reshid Bey,
who was present with Madame Reshid
Bey. Among the guests were U.S. Consul
W. F. Ryan and Mrs. Ryan, Overseas
League president Bruce Mcßrien, Dr.
and Mrs. A. Fabinyi, Mr. and Mrs. Max
Dietrich, and Sir Evelyn’s secretary, Miss
Margaret Raynor.

Operation Melbourne Cup brought
H.M.A.S. Melbourne, Warramunga,
Vampire and Voyager into port and so
gave members of the younger members’
group of the E.S.U. opportunity to enter-
tain 30 young officers at a cocktail-party
at E.S.U. House. Guests were received
by president Ron Thompson and secre-
tary Jean Cameron. The reception-rooms
were decorated with bowls of irises, lilies
and other colorful spring flowers. Among
the guests were Clarissa Starey (she
leaves shortly to take-up an appointment
with the League of Red Cross Societies
in Geneva); Anne Dixon (daughter of
Sir Owen and Lady Dixon), whose
ensemble featured a brown-and-gold
flower-patterned silk top and short knife-
pleated brown silk skirt; Laurette Hill,
who chose a gaily-striped white-and-
blue polished-cotton frock ; Margaret
Daley, in grey-and-pink floral cottons ;
Judith Johns (who has announced her
engagement to Ashley Williams); Anne
Swallow, Joy Alston, Helen Duckett,
Pamela Middleton and Rion Jenning.

Over 200 members of the council,
committees and staff of the Victorian
Division of Red Cross attended the party
in the Lucy Bryce Hall to farewell Miss
Sybil Irving, who was retiring after 13
years as general-secretary. Lady Brooks,
wife of the Governor and president of
the Victorian division, presented the
guest-of-honor with the medal for
meritorious service. Colonel Allan
Spowers, chairman of the Victorian divi-
sion, and Miss Rose Nuttall, administra-
tive-secretary, paid tribute to the wonder-
ful work done by Miss Irving during her
years with Red Cross. Cheques and gifts
were presented on behalf of the council
and committees, and the staff also made
a presentation. On Christmas Eve Miss
Irving will sail for England in Orcades ;
she will be abroad for about 13 months.
When Anne Rosemary, daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Lindsay Meredith, of
Toorak, was married at Melbourne
Grammar Chapel to Anthony James
Gorman she wore a full-length gown of
oyster-toned French-satin. Made by her
great-aunt, Mrs. G. Asker, it was entirely
hand-sewn, and featured a swathed waist-
line and a fern-design in Italian-quilting
on a front-panel of the skirt and on the
bodice, which had a rounded neckline and
long tight-fitting sleeves. A diadem of
pearl-roses and pale-gold leaves held
the full-length tulle veil, and a sheaf of
Christmas-lilies and white lilac formed
the bouquet. The bridesmaids —Althea
Jeffrey, Lindy Challingsworth and Susan
Stock —wore full-length softly-swathed
gowns of pale-chartreuse silk-shantung,
and in their hair pleated circlets of match-
ing material with a gold-green orchid
pinned in front. Their bouquets were of
matching orchids. The flower-girl was
the bride’s seven-year-old cousin Christine
Hess, from Smithton, Tasmania; her full-
length frock was of white lawn finished
with a wide sash of chartreuse silk-
shantung, and she carried a posy of
My-of-the-valley, which matched her tiny
cap. The bridegroom, only son of Mrs.
Walter J. Gorman, of Caulfield, and the
late Mr. Gorman, had Donald Cooper
as best man. Richard Monsell-Butler
and David Adam were groomsmen. At
the reception, which was held at No. 9,
Darling Street, Mr. and Mrs. Lindsay
Meredith (she wearing a sweeping gown
of pale-mushroom-pink, self-patterned
satin-brocade) received over 100 guests
with Mrs. Gorman, whose frock was of
deep-delphinium French re-embroidered
lace.
Curtain-raiser to the spring-racing
festivities is always the Derby Eve
dinner-dance in aid of the Victorian
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children. This year the Dorchester was'
the setting; garlands of artificial white
roses were twined around the pillars in
the ballroom, and the one racing motif —-
an amusing poster showing two rearing
horses painted in black and green and
finished with gold names —was behind
the flower - banked orchestra - stand.
Committee-president Mrs. lan Miller,
who wore a stunning diamond necklace
with her formal gown of sky-blue-and-
gold striped silk-taffeta, received the
official guests with her husband. These
included Lady Gullett, the society's
patroness (who, incidentally, founded the
Derby Eve function); the president, Mrs.
S. A. Eaton ; and the vice-president, Lady
Steele (wearing a black lace frock with
the bodice clustered with jet-beads).
Among the 200 guests were Mrs.
Marcel Dekyvere (Sydney), whose white
satin gown, made with a wide square
neckline, fell in graceful folds to the
floor ; Mrs. John Grimwade, who added
a lemon-taffeta stole to her high-necked,
long-sleeved gown of white organza ;
Mrs. John Forster, her silk-jersey gown
strapless, the skirt swathed into a
harem-hemline ; Mrs. Trevor Clarke
(Dunkeld), in a handsome gown of white
guipure-lace with white satin defining the
Empire-line bodice ; Angela Rau, Bar-
bara Spry and Mrs. Bruce Matear, .who
also wore lovely white gowns ; Mrs.
Desmond Deasey, whose lipstick-pink
satin gown had a deep scoop-neckline,
with the full skirt ending in a peacock-
hemline. Mrs. Geoffrey Grimwade, Mrs.
Lionel Grimwade, Mrs. Claudia Cres-
wick, Mrs. Fred Moore, Mrs. Geoffrey
Levett and Mrs. Geoffrey Wharton had
no time for frivolity—they were working
hard all night serving behind the bar.

Lady Thomas was guest-of-honor at
an afternoon-party held in the private
drawing-room of the Lady Mayoress,
Mrs. Bernard Evans, who presented her
with an Australian landscape by Hellier
and two antique goblets and a tray, gifts
from the wives of city councillors in
recognition of her work as Lady
Mayoress during her two-year term. Mrs.
Evans chose a relaxed-line jacket-
ensemble in black wool and a tiny boater
of floral-silk. Lady Thomas’s slim-
fitting frock was of marine-blue wool.
Mrs. Robert Solly, who convened the
committee which arranged the presenta-
tion, chose a suit and matching hat in
greige wool. Among the guests were
Mrs. Leslie Coleman, Mrs. Fred Hardy,
Mrs. Tony Luxton and Mrs. Alex
Bottomley.


SYDNEY"
Variety spiced the week in agreeable
fashion. The Melbourne Cup cast its
usual long-range hypnotic spell, form and
sweeps made chief topics of conversation
for people everywhere. Despite the
exodus. to the south, there were still
plenty of party-givers left behind and
plenty of guests to share the excitement.

At a very bright cocktail-party given by
Dr. and Mrs. H. C. Coombes after the
meeting of the Elizabethan Theatre Ball
Committee, cheques were handed-over
by president Mrs. Kenneth Hill and
younger-set president Graham Ducker.
Mr. Hugh Hunt suggested that these be
used to establish a scholarship for young
Australian actors as well as for a van to
take travelling-theatre to the country.
Mrs. Coombes wore a silk-brocade suit
of white, patterned with pink roses, and
Mrs. Hill’s leaf-green wool dress was
matched by her velvet curvette. Mrs.
George Sample, hon.-secretary of the
committee, was in a black silk sheath
with a deep yoke of lace and a black
whimsy. Mrs. Bob Mclnerney looked
charming in a silk-organza coat of
crystal-green with a standaway collar and
a small hat in the same color. Artist
Florence Broadhurst was also eye-
catching in royal-blue chiffons, and Mrs.
Listwan highlighted her blue silk-
shantung suit with a rose of golden-
brown to match her accessories. Mrs.
Charles Moses, Mrs. Simpson, Dr. and
M rs. P. W. E. Curtin, Mrs. Harrison,
Madam A. Redler (wife of the Consul

Nostalgia seems likely to affect the
Governor-General, Sir William Slim,
whenever he looks at the painting “Royal
Sydney Yacht Squadron,” in its beautiful
Kirribilli setting. Members made the
picture a farewell gift to their Commo-
dore at a party held there last week,
when Lady Slim was given a bouquet
by Mrs. Fred White, president of the
associates. Guests were received by Vice-
Commodore and Mrs. R. A. Dickson,
assisted by Rear-Commodore and Mrs.
Alexis Albert.
At a combined party given the night
before by the Royal Commonwealth
Society, Royal Overseas League and the
Victoria League, at which Sir William
and Lady Slim were guests-of-honor, his
Excellency assured listeners he had no
intention of writing a book about Aus-
tralia when he returned to England. The
happy thought left by his speech was that
he felt he was “one of us.” He added that
if you wanted to sell a book you must
say a few scandalous things, and he
didn’t know any about Australia.
Despite storms and transport hind-
rances, a large and appreciative audience
was at the opening-night of the Priestley
play “Time and the Conways,” at the
Independent Theatre on Friday. It
included Dr. and Mrs. Frank, Madam
Krauss, Mrs. H. G. Pratten and Mrs.
Southwell Keely (her daughter Carolyn
was in the cast). At the supper-party
afterwards there was much disappoint-
ment that director Doris Fitton was too
ill with ’flu to be present. Secretary Mrs.
Williams, Mrs. Southwell Keely and
Mrs. R. M- Champ were among those
who helped entertain. Members are
looking forward with great anticipation
to the visit of J. B. Priestley as guest-
speaker at the theatre on Sunday,
November 22.
Charming Jessica Noad takes the role
of Paulina in “The Winter’s Tale," which
opened the J.C.W. Shakspeare Company’s
season at the Theatre Royal last week.
Although this is the first time she has
played in Shakspeare, Jessica has been
a favorite of theatre audiences for many
years, both here and in England.
Recently she co-starred with Dame Sybil
Thorndike in “The Chalk Garden,” and
also played opposite Edwin Styles in
“Not in the Book!” She will soon be
seen in her first film-role in
“Summer of the 17th Doll," in a part
specially written for the film. Jessica,
who is the fortunate possessor of lovely
brown eyes and the sort of skin which
takes on a golden-tan in the summer, is
a member of a pioneering family—her
grandparents were well known in the
Queensland-N.S. W. border-district.
One of Saturday's prettiest brides was
Judy Bowering, only child of Mr. and
Mrs. R. K. Bowering, of Portland and
Rose Bay, whose marriage to Peter
Scott at St. Michael's, Vaucluse,
brought guests from a number of country
districts. Her gown was of classical
lines, an apron-front on the skirt be-
came a bustle at the back, and finished
with a train and large bow. A curvette
of the same white delustred satin was
pearl-trimmed, and held in place a tulle
veil. She carried white camellias. June
Read, of Rose Bay, and Jean Flack
Smith, of Walgett, were charming brides-
maids in their frocks of Atlantic-blue
silk-taffeta, with pleated cowl neckline
on the fitted bodice and bell skirt. The
’groom, who is the youngest son of Mr.
and Mrs. A. P. Scott, of Bellevue Hill,
had Alan Stuart Duff, of Vaucluse, as
best man, and Graham McElwain, of
Double Bay, as groomsman. Among
guests at the reception held at Amory
were Mr. and Mrs. G. Ward, and Mr.
and Mrs. A. Newman, of Kandos ; Mr.
and Mrs W. Everell, Mr. and Mrs. W.
Douglas, Mr. and Mrs. R. K. Bowering,
all of Portland.

Cotter and her daughters Marjorie and

Double Bay home for some months.
Although they made a flat in Kensing-

Continent most of the time, seeking out-
of-the-way places, and, by the tone of
their letters, succeeding in such a way
as to bring envy to many of their stay-
at-home friends. They plan to return
home soon by plane. Before coming

Other travellers’ tales of more than
usual interest came from Mr. and Mrs.
S. K. Mitchell, of Melbourne, who
returned in the Himalaya from its first
triangular trip to the U.S. and the Far
East; eight weeks of travelling and sight-
seeing, after which Mrs. Mitchell felt a
quiet spell at home was needed to sort-
out the many impressions. There was
no time for any such quiet reflection
while the ship was in Sydney ; they were
caught-up in a round of welcome-home
parties. These included a dinner-party
at the home of Mr. and Mrs. M. M.
Threlfall, of Hillview, Turramurra, and
another at the Australia given for them
by Mr. and Mrs. Alan Adams.

When was the Royal Society of
Canberra founded?
A scientific society was estab-
lished in Canberra in 1930, and in
the following year it obtained the
King’s permission to use the title
of “Royal Society of Australia.”
The object of the society is “the
promotion of learning and research
in science in its broadest aspects.”
It provides a common meeting-
ground for the members of the large
scientific community 'concentrated
in the . Commonwealth capital.
Monthly meetings are held, and
provision is made for the formation
of specialist sections. No publica-
tions are issued. In May, 1955,
the name was changed to “Royal
Society of Canberra.”

What are pseudo-scorpions ?
This is a popular name for small
scorpion-like arachnids of the order
Chelonethi. Only about £in. in
length, they resemble the true
scorpions in the form of the pedi-
palps, but lack the tail-like post-
abdomen and a terminal sting.
Pseudo-scorpions have spinning-
organs, opening in the chelicerae;
the silk is used in making a cocoon,
or nest, into which the animal may
retreat for moulting, breeding or
hibernation. The various species
live under the bark of trees, under
stones or in vegetable debris —
sometimes inside books. Because
of their small size these creatures
have not. been collected to any
extent in Australia, but about 30
species are definitely known.

Details of the literary relationship
between Mollie Skinner and D. H.
Lawrence ?
When the English author D. H.
Lawrence arrived in Perth in 1922
he and his wife stayed at a guest-
house run by writer Mollie Skinner
and a partner. A friendship
developed, and Lawrence collabor-
ated with Miss Skinner in the
writing of a novel, The Boy in the
Bush. The story had been written
by Miss Skinner, but Lawrence
declared that she had “no con-
structive power” and offered to
recast it. Lawrence said that he
thought the story would make an
interesting book, even though she
had left the hero s character
“psychologically at a standstill all
the way.” “If you like,” he wrote,
“we will appear as collaborators
• . . or we can have a single non-
de-plume; and we can go halves in
English and American royalties.”
The book appeared in 1924. For
a full account, see “Meanjin,”
vol. ix, no. 4 (1950), and vol. xiv,
no. 2 (1955).

oppression” today it depends how you
define “oppression” but in both
instances he is setting down the facts
as he saw them; and the book as a
whole seems a very fair account of
his trip. His conclusion is: “I was
seeing with my own eyes and for my

noble races of the earth breaking the
bonds of feudalism and slavery. How

secondary importance to the fact that
it was being done, and being done

A Patrick White Novel
When I had finished reading
Patrick White’s “Voss” I put the book
down with a peculiar feeling that it
was not only “Voss” —a curious,
powerful and beautiful enough book
on its own—but another Patrick White
novel . . . perhaps not written yet,
perhaps never to be written, but never-
theless one that might be: a book
about a spinster.
Now I have read The Aunt’s Story
(Eyre and Spottiswoode), which is a
book about a spinster, though still not
the one I believe to be “somewhere.”
It confirms me in a conviction that
the other either is, or could be.
“The Aunt’s Story” is a 1948 novel
which has been reprinted. In one sense
I had long been anxious to read it, in
another not very keen to. When an
author achieves real grandeur, as I
believe White to have done, his early
works are often reprinted and prove
disappointing—mere pointers to what
was to come, or sometimes not even
that.
“The Aunt’s Story” is more than a
pointer. White’s odd stylistic devices
are crystallised there; his inexorable,
exact carefulness that piles detail on
detail but never, by some miracle of
relevance, bores one. The movement
of the story, too, proceeds very like
comparable parts of the later novels. It
begins with Mrs. Goodman’s death and
Theodora’s sensations of liberation.
She has been the classic daughter left
at home to care for an ageing parent;
the plain girl whose defects have
crystallised into* real ugliness by her
mother’s contempt for her looks and
abilities. Mrs. Goodman’s rare
demonstrativeness had been reserved
for Fanny.
“Oh,” she cried, “Fanny, my
roses, my roses, you are very pretty.”
Because Fanny was as pink and
white as roses in the new dress.
“And Theo,” she said, “all
dressed up. Well, well. But I don’t
think we’ll let you wear yellow again,
because it doesn’t suit, even in a
sash. It turns you sallow,” Mother
said.
Theodora’s father, with whom she
had an affinity, died when she was a
young girl. He was not a “successful”
grazier, and his property, Meroe,
which Theodora loved, had been de-
clining for many years—there is an
atmosphere of disintegration about all
her childhood which is the more
poignant because she is so plainly not
equipped to look forward to future
compensations of husband and
children.
For some years Theodora and a
rich solicitor, Huntly Clarkson, had an
equivocal sort of friendship:—
“I collect,” he said, “unusual
objects. I have the signatures of
four English kings. I have the
breviary of Maximilian of Mexico,
and a ball of hair that was cut out
of the stomach of a cat.”
Had she wanted marriage he would
have collected her in a puzzled, half-
willing way. But by that time she
was as surely a spinster as any dedi-
cated celibate:—
“Why won’t you take him?” Mrs.
Goodman said.
“Why must I take, take? It is
not possible to possess things with
one’s hands.”
There is her tragedy. For in spite
of her absolute disinterest in her
appearance (for moustaches and
sallowness are not true bars to
attractiveness—many plain women, by
charm of manner, wit, smartness of
dress and assurance make themselves
tremendously fascinating), and in spite
of some tomboyish tastes and prowess
with a rifle, Theodora is absolutely
feminine. No one could resemble less
a Radcliffe Hall character.
In “Jardin Exotique,” the second
section of the book, the middle-aged
Theodora, free from her mother’s
physical tyranny, has travelled exten-
sively in Europe and come at last to
the Hotel du Midi, somewhere on the
French Riviera,
This section marks Patrick White
as an author of the most powerful
imagination and rigid control. For
Theodora is not merely a lonely,
barmy old maid spinning fantasies and
hearing voices. There is between her
and the other characters a complete,
though fantastic rapport that is only
possible because they, too, are not very
sane: they are old, defeated people
living in false dreams and giving
untrue accounts of themselves to the
world, or young, inadequate people
equally deluded. Their lives touch in
a curious melange of all Theodora’s
past reading.
For instance at times Theodora and
the greedy, dirty old Russian, General
Sokolnikov, become brother and
sister and re-live incidents in a
Russian-novel life (that is a lie in
itself). In this guise she robs (for her
brother) the room of Mrs. Rapallo, an
elderly lady of American birth, of a
nautilus shell the General covets, dis-
turbing Mrs. Rapallo’s little pet
monkey and litter of souvenirs to do
so. This scene of tremendous climax
and weird comedy could almost be
subtracted from the book to display
White’s pyrotechnic virtuosity and
skill as a novelist.
At the Hotel du Midi Theodora
acquires a sort of foster-niece,
Katina Pavlou, a wealthy, beautiful
Greek heiress in the care of an
English Nanny, until she shall be old
enough for the “good” marriage
planned by her parents. She “saves”
this young girl, not from the fire that
consumes the hotel, but from the
despair of phantom love.
“Holstius,” the third and concluding
short section of the book, finds
Theodora journeying back to Australia
across America. She leaves her train
impulsively in a depressed country dis-
trict and, after a brief sojourn with a
poor, kindly'family, finds her way to a
deserted house. Before a doctor, called
by these considerate people, arrives to
take her away she converses with a
visitor named Holstius. He is the truth,
philosophy and understanding of
Theodora Goodman made flesh. In
her last hours of privacy she, by his
agency, gains absolute insight into
herself and her life. The writing here
is most delicate, yet strong both in
itself and from its symbolism.
No brief extracts from “Jardin
Exotique” or “Holstius” could convey
how much the one is a tour-de-force
or the other profound.
But the spinster whose story I can
imagine Patrick White writing is more
like Laura of “Voss” than Theodora,
though she would contain elements of
both, I think, and might indeed grow
from Laura. She is the dedicated,
strong, remarkable woman who
became all the famous early head-
mistresses of Australian girls’ schools,
and all the first Matrons of our large
hospitals—the woman who made a
career before careers were ready-made
for women. She has been the subject
of a few inadequate biographies in
commemorative pamphlets, but has
never been understood or interpreted
as a truly perceptive novelist can
understand and interpret. That is the
Patrick White novel I am waiting for.
