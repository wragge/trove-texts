Caution.
The extraordinary reputation of Rowland’s Macassar

offer rnaiious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Howland A Sons, of 20.

necessary to buy no Macassar Oil, Kalydor or Odonto

The main objects of the Company, briefly stated, are 1. To establish an Irrigation Colony at
Mulgoa, near Sydney, in the colony of New South Wales. 2. To purchase and acquire the rights and
privileges of the promoters, Messrs. George Chaffey and Henry Gorman, granted under the Act of
Parliament called the Mulgoa Irrigation Act. This Act was passed by the Parliament of New South
Wales in December, 1890, and enables and authorises Messrs. George Chaffey and Henry Gorman
“ to establish a system of irrigation and water supply within and adjacent to the police district of
Penrith, to acquire lands to establish irrigation works, to authorise the sale and supply of water for
irrigation and domestic use, and to construct, make, and lay dams, weirs, or floodgates upon or across
the Nepean and Warragamba Rivers, and for all other purposes which may be incidental thereto.”
And 3. To exercise the rights under the provisional contracts made by the promoters or on their behalf
with the owners of the lands proposed to be irrigated, and which are set forth hereunder,
The estates which in the first instance it is proposed to form into an Irrigation Colony (the first
in New South Wales), consisting of rich, fruit-growing, horticultural lands, suitable for the growth of
oranges, lemons, apricots, peaches, nectarines, vines, &c., in area about 20.900 acres in all, situated in
the County of Cumberland, 30 miles or thereabouts from Sydney, in tho parishes of Mulgoa, Chu-e-
-mont, Melville, and Rooty Hill, and extending to within a mile of the railway station of the pro-
sperous town of Penrith, and adjoimng St. Mary’s on the Great Western Line of Railway, form the
key to the whole country round Mulgoa. These can be irrigated from the Nepean and Warragamba
Rivers, and it is proposed to sell these lands in blocks of 5 and 10 acres and upwards, with water rights
attached. The actual cost of the land will be under £l2 per acre, and the time required for carrying
out the works so as to commence supplying water it is estimated will be within nine months. The
promoters confidently expect that these blocks, with the water rights, will realise a profit of from £25
to £5O per acre.
The genuineness of this enterprise and the practical skill of the Messrs. Chaffey (the head of which
firm, Mr. George Chaffey, C.E., will be the consulting engineer) are sufficient guarantees that this
great creative work, the first in New South Wales, will be carried out in a profitable way, and on a
scale not before attempted in this colony.
Messrs. Chaffey Brothers have successfully established irrigation colonies at Etiwanda and
Ontario, in California, where the lands improved by the growth of vineyards, orange and lemon
groves, &c., have been sold at from £250 to £3OO per acre.
Messrs. Chaffey Brothers have also successfully established, and are profitably developing on a
scale commensurate with the magnitude of the enterprise, the irrigation colonies of Mildura (in Vic-
toria, 500 miles from Melbourne) and Renmark (in South Australia, 250 miles from Adelaide).
The Vendors have agreed to transfer to the Company the valuable concessions, privileges, and
rights referred to, for the sum of £25,000, and 125,000 shares fully paid up ; they have, however, such
faith in the enterprise that they have agreed not to transfer 100,000 of the shares for a period of three
years from the incorporation of the Company.
The following contracts and agreements have been made, namely :
7th January, 1891. —Agreement, E. Standish Cox one part, and George Chaffey and Henry
Gorman other part.
7th January, 1891.—-Agreement, the Hon. George Henry Cox one part, and George Chaffey and
Henry Gorman other part.
10th January, 1891.—Agreement, Robert Marsden Fitzgerald, attorney of Elizabeth Rouse
Alston and William Evelyn Alston, one part, and George Chaffey and Henry Gorman
other part.
12th January, 1891.—Agreement Thomas Carnes Jamieson, William Charles Valentine Gibbes,
and Alfred George Gibbes, of one part, and George Chaffey and Henry Gorman other
part.
13th January, 1891. —Agreement, the Metropolitan Mutual Permanent Building and Invest-
ment Association, Limited, one part, and George Chaffey and Henry Gorman other part.
’ 14th January, 1891. —Agreement, Phillip Gidley King one part, and George Chaffey and Henry
Gorman other part.
20th January, 1891. —Agreement, Sir Daniel Cooper one part, and George Chaffey and Henry

Henry Gorman other part.
22nd January, 1891.—Agreement, Fitzwilliam Wentworth one part, and George Chaffey and
Henry Gorman other part.
28tb January, 1891.—Agreement, George Chaffey and Henry Gorman Ist part, William
Benjamin Chaffey, Elisha Clement de Garis, Robert William Hardie, and Arthurn Win-
bourne Stephen, 2nd part, and John Francis King (a trustee on behalf of the Company)
of the 3rd part.
The Memorandum and Articles of Association, and the contracts and agreements above men-
tioned, and the “ Mulgoa Irrigation Act ” above referred to, may be inspected at the offices of Messrs.
Dibbs and Gibson, Eldon Chamber's, 92 Pitt-street, Sydney.
A large number of shares have already been applied for, and the promoters have confidence in
stating that persons of moderate means, as well as large investors, will find, thin a lucrative investment.
The whole of the application money will be placed to the credit of the company, less the amount
to be paid to the vendors, and the usual charges for brokerage, advertising, printing fees, legal and
other expenses, &c., incurred in the formation of the company.
The Company will be registered as soon as 200,000 of the shares have been applied for.
Applications for shares should be made upon the accompanying form, and forwarded to the
brokers of the company, together with the amount payable on application. Where the number of
shares allotted is less than the number applied for, the surplus will be credited in reduction of the
amount payable on allotment.
Should no Allotment of shares be made, the amounts will be returned in full.

though you bo perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards xxses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never presexibes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. AD
communications should be addressed

SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the ifediral Boar I of N.S. W. S " r '
germ to the Great northern Hospital, Lnnd.i i
T am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the treatment of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by qualified Men in the treatment of
throttle and Nervous VontplalnU has Induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unli t itc.i assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promised trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these discn. es
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical hnquiiy
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph, Nov.
6th 7th and sth, h-W) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in wliich patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money but What is of infl-itely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that I,•■gaily Qualified lien entered tile
field to fight these pests of society with their own
wpfißons, viz., Advorlisiiisf*
It is utterly impossible for those who are sufiermg
from the*e disease*, who are scattered over all parts of
Australasia? to ascertain which quilled IVaclit oner
makes those diseases his speciality unless he advertises,
I consider therefore, that by advertising J imt tody
strike a How at the Quackery which now crisis, hat I also add
to the. .usefulness of my profession ami in no Kay lessen my
personal dignity.

A Freetrade Manifesto.
The much-vaunted Freetrade Democratic
Association, which was to have shattered the
Protectionist policy of Victoria, and knocked
the fragments about, and thrown the small
dust of the old fiscal superstition into the
sea, still struggles painfully along and makes
very little impression. Now and then its
component parts meet in a dimly-lighted
hall, and make surprising assertions to each
other in the gloom, and read astonishing
statistics to each other off crumpled papers
which they haul out from among their
clothes ; and they also develope into mani-
festoes now and then, which precious docu-
ments the Association treasures up next to
its stomach. The following is a hunk from
the latest production perpetrated on behalf
of the society by one Gurry— a burning
and a shining light among the Freetrade
apostles :
Protection is all theory. What are the facts about its
influence upon wages ? The average wages in protected
Europe are 14s. per week. In Freetrade England the
average is 30s. Bd. This 30s. 8d in England goes as far as
555. a week here. Do our wages average 555. a week ?
Nothing like it. The paupers in England are lin 30
of the population. In protected France they are 1 in
18—nearly double. We have a duty of 20s. a pair on
axles for lorries, &c. The English price is 255. a pair, so
the duty is nearly 100 per cent. The men who make these
axles in Staffordshire earn £5 a week. 1 know this for a
fact. Yet we can’t make them at double the price. . .
The proof that Protection lowers wages is to be found in
the fact that every working man in this colony with a
family of four whose expenditure is £3 per week pays 12s.
per week in taxes on everything he buys. This is a reduc-
tion of 25 per cent in their wages.
The one drawback about this manifesto is
that the facts are wrong, and the figures are
infamous bosh, and the statements are howl-
ing ignorance, and the inferences are shriek-
ing insanity, and everything is degrading
stupidity except the commas. But it is such
a brilliant example of the sort of material
the average Foreign-trader travels on that
if is worth looking at.
# # •
The average wages in England, to begin
with, are not 30s. Bd. per week, but 20s. 6d.
The English artisan, it is true, is understood
to make 30s. Bd. per week, supposing he is
engaged all the year round—which fie cer-
tainly is not; but the nation never struck
such an all-round average since the world
began. And, as for the average wages in
Protected Europe, they are not known to
anybody, for the sufficient reason that at
least two countries have furnished no statis-
tics, and three or four more supply only the
most rudimentary guesses on the subject,
and, therefore, the Freetrade Democratic
Association might as well undertake to tell
what wages are paid in Saturn, or to give a
tip about horse-racing in the Polar-star.
But in one or two Protected countries the
average certainly is 14s. or thereabouts,
against 20s. 6d. in England, and at the same
time the entire cost of living, including food,
rent, clothes, drink, education, and taxes, is
Os. 9d. per head, as against Bs. 3d. in Free-
trade Britain ; and, therefore, the foreigner
might, if he spent only what is
theoretically or statistically necessary, save
in one year enough to keep him for 16
months, where the Englishman, on the high-
est estimate, could save enough to maintain
him for nine months only. These figures
are taken from Mulhall, the greatest living
authority on such subjects, and if the- Asso-
ciation knows more statistics than Mulhall
then it could give Mahomet points about the
Koran, and furnish Edison with information
on electric science, and supply Demosthenes
with a lift in the matter of Greek roots.
And as regards the pathetic query—“Do
our wages average 555. per week ?”—it is
only necessary to reply briefly that they
don’t, and that nobody ever said they did.
They average about 405,, and as any indi-
vidual can live as cheaply in Melbourne or
Sydney as in London, and more cheaply in
Auckland than any of the three, it is diffi-
cult to guess what the row is about. They
do not live as cheaply certainly, for the
regime of dry bread and pig-fat has not yet
been introduced in this country, but the
bread and the fat are both less expensive,
and a wooden cottage at Botany is as low-
priced as a home in a dismal slum at Hox-
ton, and rags cost about the same at both
ends of the earth, and dirt and broken
bottles and cheap boots and bad beer keep
on much the same level.
% # 0
The figures concerning pauperism, how-
ever, are a wilder, louder burst of menda-
city than all the rest of the manifesto put
together. The paupers of England are
correctly described as forming 1 in 30 of the
population ; the paupers of Paris are as 1 to
18 of that city’s inhabitants, but those of
France most assuredly are not, and the man
who professes to fit the average of one
crowded city to an entire country would
attempt to prove as readily—if it suited his
purpose —that because there was one murder
to the square mile in London on a certain
week, therefore the annual murders of
England would be arrived at by multiplying
the weeks and the square miles together—
result : three million homicides per annum.
The pauperism of the whole French nation
is about 1 in 26 of the entire population, a
result which is about 12 per cent, worse
than England. But in France the figures
represent the entire number who receive
even the smallest donation from any public
charity in the course of the year ; in
England they represent only the number of
paupers who are in receipt of relief on one
single day—generally the Ist of January.
And even these do not include “casual
poor,” who are numerous, and “ vagrants ”
who are past counting. When the
pauperism of England is estimated on the
same basis as that of France, it reaches the
ast.unding total of one in nine of the whole
English people ! and the Association which
can find an argument in favour of Freetrade
in these figures could also find thunder at
the bottom of the sea, and whales floating in
the atmosphere. The maintenance of the
innumerable paupers of England costs ss. Bd.
for every inhabitant ; those of France cost
Is. 6d. only, and the rest of Protected
Europe is run on an even cheaper basis.
* * *
The Freetrade citizen who makes axles at
£5 per week is hardly worth demolishing.
The middleman, who lives on axle-making,
certainly makes that amount, and the man
who does the work receives about 255. on a
steady average. He occupies exactly the
same position with regard to the prosperous
individual quoted by the Freetrade Associa-
tion as the discharged soldier with a wooden
leg and an extinguished eye who starves in
the workhouse does to the Duke of Cam-
bridge, and his position isn’t improving by
any means. The Freetrade litterateur who
howls in Melbourne “knows” his statements
“ for a fact,” and the present writer knows
his from personal experience, and because
he has been there, so the two are about
square. And concerning the Victorian
workman, who pays 12s. a week in taxes
out of an expenditure of £3, it would be a
gladsome thing if the Democratic Freetrade
Association would explain whom he pays it to.
For on that basis the entire Customs duties
of Victoria would amount to some nine
millions per annum, and as they only
amount to a little over two millions, there
is a ghastly discrepancy somewhere. And
as the Customs duties of Freetrade New
South Wales come to just about the same
amount, there is another awful discrepancy
in the argument, and as the Customs of
Freetrade England are the biggest in the
world, we arrive at the saddest discrepancy
of all, for Freetrade seems to be a trifle the
heavier tax of the two. Also, it would~be
pleasing to learn how 12s. comes to be 25
per cent, on £3, for this is also a heavy piece
of arithmetical shovelling ; and it would
make the world in general feel better if the
Association would show how the hypothe-
tical workman who doesn’t earn 555. a week
is to spend £3 anyh »w. ; and if, in addition,
it would expound the reason why all its
figures should have come out wrong without
one solitary exception, it would lift a heavy
load off the soul of many a tired calculator.
For a society that hasn’t even one solitary
fact belonging to it is a very weary thing
indeed.
* # #
Freetrade has made a good many bad
breaks at different times, but under the
guidance of the “ Democratic ” Association
it has not broken in the ordinary sense of
the term —it has burst, and exploded into
small dust. A society that is so full of
massive ignorance would solemnly argue
that the egg and the elephant were the same
sort of animal, because their names both
began with “e,” and, most likely, can’c find
its own feet without the assistance of a
diagram. It exists, apparently, by having
one man to collect the fiction and another
to distort the facts, and yet, surprising as its
information may be, its logic is a great deal
more amazing still. Here is a favourable
sample :
Neither can it be more than theory to say, without
giving instances and proofs, that when the duties were
imposed, workshops flourished. They could not have
flourished very much because they all want higher pro-
tection every year.
That about strikes the summit of human
derangement. It is a whole Himalaya of
idiocy and a Niagara of rushing drivel.
Protection must be bad because Victoria
wants more Protection every year, and
therefore we presume Freetrade would be
bad if the country wanted more of it every
year, and food is bad because the whole
human race wants it, and clothes and money
and boots are all objectionable for the same
reason. Any other alleged human being
would think that Victoria had found Pro-
tection rather a success else it wouldn’t
desire more of it, but, according to the Free-
trade Democratic Association, the fact that
Victoria wants Protection is the one over-
whelming circumstance which proves that it
doesn’t want Protection. Or, to express it
differently, the circumstance that the country
asks for Protection shows that it wants
Freetrade, and if it asked for Freetrade that
would also show that it wanted Freetrade,
and if it put a duty of 1800 per cent, upon
everything that would probably show that it
was absolutely howling for Freetrade.
Truly there are many different kinds of
logicians in this world, and some of them
have long ears, and go around on all-fours,
and argue chiefly with their hind legs.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Federal Conference.
The Federation Conference, from which such
great results are anticipated, meets next month,
and after that there will probably be a glorious
row. There will be about 30 delegates present,
and it is already sufficiently evident that 29 of
them will take one side in the discussion, and
Parkes will take the other, and after that lie
will spend the rest of his existence in telling
how 29 obstinate men wrecked the grandest
project ever heard of on earth. For out of the
vast resources of his inherent cussedness
Parkes has already resolved that the Federa-
tion must be built on the Canadian model, and
he has expressed this view over and over again
in letters and speeches ; and as no other pre-
sumably sane and responsible individual has a
desire to see the Canadian system reproduced in
Australia the old man’s foregone conclusion
must lead to trouble. The reason of his deter-
mination is easily understood. The scheme of
the Canadian Dominion is practically centralisa-
tion in its worst form. It extinguishes local
rights and local government, and its adoption
in Australia is simply the annexation to New
South Wales or to Victoria —whichever chances
to get uppermost—of South Australia, Queens-
land, West Australia, and Tasmania, and after
that it means either the annexation of Victoria
to New South Wales or of New South Wales
to Victoria, according as circumstances may
decide. It is very much the same system by
which England governs Ireland —the smaller
province has a due share of representation, but
as its government, down to the smallest detail,
is in the hands of the central legislature, it is
outvoted on every point, and cannot exercise
the slightest control over any single
matter relating to its own welfare. It
is a method which was invented in Canada
so that the English-speaking majority in one
colony might utterly wipe out the French-
speaking majority in another and deprive them
of any power to make their own laws or to
shape their own destinies; it was invented in
England so that Ireland and Scotland might
eacli have their share in a free Parliament, and
yet each should be as powerless to do anything
for itself as if it were a conquered country
governed by martial law ; and it is proposed
t hat it should be adopted in Australia because
New South Wales is the most populous state in
the group, and, consequently, Parkes believes
that it is possible to virtually annex all this
continent to New South Wales and rim the
show alone. And further, the old politician
suffers from the conviction that all New South
Wales is Parkes in the present, and, therefore,
all Australia will be Parkes in the future, and
he also labours under a vague impression that
almost all the habitable globe is Parkes in dis-
guise, and that he is the largest part of the
solar system. But the rest of the Australias have
had enough of centralisation, and the proposi-
■ tion that they should give themselves away
gratis for Parkes’ amusement has no attrac-
tions. The Federation they want is a union on
the plan of the United States, which gives to
the smallest member of the league the same
power over its own internal affairs as is
possessed by the largest, and not a combination
by which one or two provinces are to own Aus-
tralia, while the others cannot assert their right
to make even a drain or a railway-crossing on
their own responsibility, except by insurrection.
And as this latter is the only sort of Federation
that Parkes cares alamt, the dissonant voice is
likely to be heard at the conference complain-
ing in accents of anger and indignation that all
the regiment is out of step excepting only
Private Murphy —that individual being him-
self.
An Australian Interest.
Nothing but hard bungling on one side and
hard, energetic shooting on the other prevented
the establishment the other day of another
European republic, and the abolition of another
European king. For several years past the
Portuguese have suffered from an aching desire
to throw overboard their little shrivelled-up
potentate, with all his relatives, and his regalia,
and his other utensils of monarchy, and a few
days ago they just missed their chance by a
hair’s-breadth. The British Government lent
its moral influence to prop up the miserable
bankrupt swindle that reigns beside the Tagus,
because the Tory party loathes and abhors
Republicanism, and grovels to Monarchy no
matter how mean it may be, and for the
same reason that it habitually insults France
and abases itself before Germany ; but, despite
British influence, King Carlos’ crown will go,
almost to a certainty, at the next shot,
Portugal hasn’t found Monarchy a success.
Under its control the country has sunk into a
miserable little patch of sores and sin and
ignorance, and has acquired the biggest debt
per head in all Europe; and the army has
degenerated into a bug-bitten mob, armed with
rusty swords and burnt-out stove-pipes, and
the treasury is an 10 U stowed away in a dis-
used boiler, and the navy consists chiefly of one
old scow, which is being eaten away by worms
on a sand-bank, and there is nothing left to beg
or borrow or steal or confiscate from north to
south and from east to west in all the mouldered,
moth-devoured kingdom of the Braganzas.
That is to say, there is nothing but priests, and
nobody wants to confiscate them, for priests are
more common in Portugal than mud. It is
hardly possible to swing an umbrella loosely
in any part of the Portuguese territory
without afterwards finding the eye of some
holy father stuck on the end of it, and
the individual who assaults six inhabi-
tants in the dark is sure to be arrested
next morning for smashing four preachers, one
soldier, and a tax-gatherer. As for the people
in general, they work 14 hours a day and live
on nothing in particular a week, and the
amount they don’t know is enormous, for there
is not enough education in the country to teach
the average Portuguese to know his own feet
when he sees them. The Braganzas have
systematically spent money and smothered
education and boomed the Pope, and they have
also been celebrated in another way, for they
have bolted faster and further, whenever an
enemy was in sight, than any other batch of
monarchs in Europe. When Portugal is in a
tight place the private soldier—the individual
who is always kicked and never paid— is sent
to the front, and the officers shove him on from
behind, and the commander-in-chief escapes
into a tree, and the king dives down inoo a hole
and remains there till times improve. When
Spain and Portugal both get rid of their kings
the two countries will probably unite and form
,a great and progressive nation, but they have
been kept apart because neither of the kings
would give up his miserable job, and so they
have quarrelled and fought and bombarded
each other’s cities for the sake of two knock-
kneed monarchs with fallen-in stomachs, who
preferred to see their subjects quarrel and
minder each other rather than run the risk of a
coalition which would make one of them'un-
necessary. For the last 70 or 80 years Britain
lias undertaken to back up the Portuguese
monarch against all comers, and consequently
Australia, as part of the British Empire, has a
vested interest in the ignorant little spectre
that Portugal is so anxious to get rid of. And,
taking him all round, he is indeed a pleasant
object for any democratic community to have
an interest in.
Pro-trader Parkes the Free-tectionist.
Premier Parkes is, of course, absolutely loyal
to Freetrade. He is not, therefore, merely
trying to bulldoze the New South Wales Pro-
tectionist party by conditionally offering a con-
tract of 175,000 tons of steel rails to any
capitalists who will locally start the iron
industry; he is only expanding Freetrade
principles on wider curves and broadening him-
self down from precedent to precedent. Simi-
larly, the S.M. Herald, organ of the importers’
gang and Cos., is only stupefied by its own
smoke, and is not Parkes’ conscienceless hench-
man when it thus challenges ridicule (italics
ours): —
The policy of the New South Wales Government in
offering a large order on terms which entailed an increased
expenditure, though not touch an excess us would out-
weigh the collateral advantages of local production, was
not a policy of Protection.
Of course, it wasn’t. And an Imperial Governor,
at £7OOO a year and perks, is not a representa-
tive of Queen Victoria, but merely a “ citizen
of New South Wales.” And a man sent
to gaol for life is not imprisoned at all;
he merely voluntarily retires from publicity.
And the Sydney Morning Herald is not
a capitalistic paper, but labours wholly
and solely in the cause of the wage-earner.
What is the Herald giving us? The very
essence of Freetrade is “to buy in the cheapest
market,” and unless the Government of New
South Wales is prepared to submit its 175,000-
tons steel-rail contract to “ Dutch auction ”
open to all the world, without any conditions,
save as to quality, price, and time of delivery,
they have utterly departed from Freetrade
ethics and have adopted a Protectionist policy.
The Herald sees this all right enough, and
consequently it wriggles thus :
And no Freetrader who was not also a doctrinaire or a
pedant would cavil at it.
The Bulletin here merely remarks that no
Freetrader worthy of the name exists who is
not both a doctrinaire and a pedant.
The M‘Kinley Tariff.
The recent struggle over the M‘Kini,ky Tariff
is hailed by the Australian Foreign-traders as
the greatest Freetradc,triuinph since the Irish
Famine, rather than the logic of Cobden and the
eloquence of Bright, forced Peel to repeal the
Corn Laws. The last mail, however, brings
authentic information on this point. Goldwin
Smith was some years ago considered one of the
most prominent publicists in England. He
chose, however, to accept a professorship in an
American University, and afterwards drifted
into Canadian politics. Naturally he has since
been regarded as an authority on Transatlantic
affairs. Writing in the January number of
Macmillan’s Magazine on the M'Kinley
ft


Tariff, the Professor, though an enthusiastic
I reetrader, is careful to point out that the
recent Democratic victory was a declaration
against the excesses of the M‘Kinley Tariff,
but not iu favour of Frcetrade, He writes :
It may be doubted whether a single candidate, north of
Mason and Dixie’s line at all events, presented himself to
the electors as a Freetrader—Freetrader was the most
damaging epithet which Republicans could hurl against
the foe, while journals which heartily opposed M'Kinley
and exult in his defeat, continue indignantly to disclaim
the imputation of Freetrade principles.
Perhaps, after all, Goldwin Smith’s opinion on
economic questions does not weigh so much as
Pulseord s. Such an attack on his favourite
doctrine in las favourite pages wo commend to
the attention of Mr. B. R. Wise.
The political world of Victoria—which com-
prises some two or three hundred souls, and a
few newspapers without souls—is more or less
agitated by the behaviour of Mr. £ ‘ Righteous ”
M rixon, one of the most wearisome members
of the late Gillies picnic-party. Wrixon, in
his former capacity of Attorney-General, was
elected (chiefly by himself) to act as a Victorian
delegate at the Federal Convention, but now
that he has reverted to his primeval state, and
possesses no capacity at all, the voice of the
country is understood to be calling upon this
uninteresting person to retire from the hurly-
burly and get lost amongst memories of the
past. In truth the political personality of
Wrixon, such as it was, died with the Coalition
Government. When he left off being “ chief
Law Officer of the Crown ” he became the hus-
band of Money Miller’s daughter—merely
that, and nothing more, his solitary achieve-
ment in Parliament having been a Puritanical
Bill for inciting people to suicide on the
Sabbath Day. Wrixon, in a word, goes to the
impending Convention as the ghost of a
deceased Attorney-General wearing the shoes
that properly belong to his successor, Shiels.
Not being aware that all the sawdust
dropped out of him some months ago, Wrixon
has been collecting Federation platitudes in
London with a view to making his hearers feel
more tired than usual when he proceeds to inter-
pose his spectral “spoke” at Sydney. This
seems particularly unkind on that gentleman’s
part. The Convention could put up with
Wrixon if he confined himself to opening the
proceedings with prayer, and relieving the
monotony with an occasional “ hear, hear !”
like a voice from the tomb. But it seems
almost certain that he intends to hang on to
this last chance of becoming a public nuisance
until the burden is no longer supportable, and
the chief reason for the proposal to exclude
reporters from next month’s cackle is an
earnest official desire that Wrixon may be
deposited outside on the mat with the strictest
Secrecy.
“ Augustus M.” writes us thus
Dear Bulletin,— A man like Carnegie, who is endea
vouring to do good, and in the manner that seems to him
the most advisable, instead of being commended for his
efforts, finds himself the object of much adverse criticism,
while Queen Victoria and other Royalist millionaires
hoard up their wealth and escape the Hood of opprobrium
against which that Republican has to contend. If, then,
this is to he the penalty for doing good, those men who
have acquired wealth by their brains would do well to
follow’ the selfish example of Queen Victoria, against
whom Sydney Daily Telegraph does not employ the
weapons of adverse criticism. It might be said that
Carnegie made his money by the sweat and toil of his
men. To some extent this is true, yet he is a benefactor,
nevertheless, for his commercial genius has found em-
ployment for thousands of men who might otherwise
have been workless. On the other hand, Victoria’s
millions (and she is far richer than Carnegie) are taken
from the industrious taxpayer, to whom she has never
given anything, and on whose shoulders she sits an
intolerable burden.
Viewed from the standpoint of present con-
ditions, Carnegie’s conduct is admirable ;
viewed from the standpoint of what should be,
it is something less than just. The unfortunate
thing is that the D.T., like many loose thinkers,
takes opportunity to administer praise or blame
from both points of vantage, as occasion suits.
It is a standing rule in the British National
Portrait Gallery that no portrait shall be
received unless the person it represents has
been dead not less than ten years. There is
the germ of a good idea in this regulation, and
if the Australians would only pass a law that
no statue shall be raised in any public place,
and no portrait hung in any public institution,
until the subject has been buried for some
period varying from a decade to a quarter of a
century, they would save a great deal of drivel
•and absurdity thereby. Pretty nearly every-
body can be a great man while he is alive, if lie
■can make it worth .while for a few newspapers
to boom him persistently, or can get the Orange
lodges or the Hibernian Society, or the
A.N.A., or all of them, to advertise him with
energy, but if his memory will not keep fresh
for 25 years after he is gone, then he is only an
empty delusion after all. By fixing such a limit
as this only a great man or a great fraud would
be handed down in enduring bronze to future
generations ; it is impossible to draw a line
which will exclude all the world’s dismal im-
postors, for many of them are very hard to
extinguish, but it is easy to sift out 90 per cent,
of the characters whose images are only cal-
culated to make the human race feel tired in
years to come. The world very seldom knows
its great men while they are alive. A century
ago it didn’t feel sure whether George Wash-
ington or George HI. was likely to last the
longer in history ; it imagined at one time that
>I A mes I. w r as n lore important than S ll akes r e a re,
and that Louis XV. amounted to a great deal,
and Voltaire to very little. And as it generally
rushed to put up a statue to the ass of the
moment, before it had time to take stock of his
ears, it happens that we fall over the image of
some forgotten fool at every corner, and crowd
<ip everywhere against the painted semblance
of some extinct king or some useless local
cheesemonger or glorified slaughterman, who is
allowed to insult the human intelligence merely
because his admirers wouldn’t wait to see if he
was worth preserving.
As to the attendance at a Queensberry glove-
fight of Dan Blank, New South Whiles
Minister of the Crown, and Mr. Money Fisher,
stipendiary magistrate, we may remark that as
such affairs are not illegal in the opinion of
the. local Court to which the question was
recently submitted, the attendance at a glove-
fight of a Minister and a magistrate is merely a
question of taste. The notoriety - hunting
Dan Blank has to be in evidence at every-
thing, and it does not follow that because Mr.
Money Fisher is a paid magistrate he should
be debarred from mixing himself up with a
popular sport. Though the law may have
decided in an opposite direction, there can be
no earthly doubt that the Goddard-0 hoy n ski
affair ivas a first-class prize-fight, and nothing
else ; and it has to be remembered that the
decision of the Court which upheld the legality
of Queknsrekry glove-fights was given by Mr.
Money Fisher himself ! That is where the
question of good taste comes in with regard to
Mr. Money Fisher, who surely cannot be an
absolutely impartial judge as to the morality or
immorality of an amusement which he con-
fessedly likes.
The trail of the flunkey and the toad-eater is
everywhere. About the most amusing thing
in this world is the lofty scorn with which
“General ” Booth declares he will never let any
“common person” be associated with him in
charge of the Salvation funds, but if he accepts
anybody at all as a colleague it will be, he says,
an earl, a duke, or the Prince of Wales. Poor
old bogus Christian and bogus democrat ! The
man who talks of God as if he went out and
drank with Him every night and they lurched
home together and were equally mixed up about
finding the keyhole, and who yarns as affably
about the Redeemer as if they lived at the same
hash-temple, and who seems to have been on
terms with all the prophets, and suffers from
an incurable tendency to allude to the patriarchs
as Abe and Ike and Mo from sheer familiarity,
snuffles abjectly in the presence of a duke as
any ordinary sinner. He is so intimate with
Providence that he is more than half inclined
to allude to it as “Old P.” for the sake of
brevity, and when he gets into Paradise he will
probably pinch Peter at the gate, but his
humble reverence for the Prince of Wales re-
mains unimpaired.
When the Foreign-trade statistician starts to
demonstrate the prosperity of England under
his favourite system he always points with
unspeakable satisfaction to the decline of
pauperism, and strikes a paralytic attitude like
Ajax defying the lightning when he knew
there wasn’t any of it about. How pauperism
does decline in England was demonstrated one
day a few weeks ago. The Mile-End Board of
Guardians, at a single sitting, was staggered by
a wholesale application to admit into the work-
house 200 families who—in that one district—
were out of work, penniless, starving, without
furniture, almost without clothes, and many of
them homeless. It seemed for a moment as if
pauperism was about to increase in England at
a most alarming rate, but the Board was equal
to the occasion ; the chairman explained that he
couldn’t admit them to the workhouse because
there was no room, and he couldn’t give them
outside relief for the law wouldn’t allow it, and
thus the prosperity of England was saved from
sudden annihilation. A pauper is understood
to be a person who lives on public charity, and
if the public won’t give any charity it is evi-
dent that pauperism must diminish. If there
were ten starving citizens in Mile-End, say 50
years ago, and they all received public assist-
ance, there was a certain well-defined amount
of pauperism, and if there are 1800 to-day and
only five of them receive assistance, then the
great evil of poverty has decreased 50 per cent.
In fact, if nobody cared a curse about anybody,
then there would be no pauperism at all, and
just here it occurs to us that hell must be a
prosperous place according to Freetrade logic,
for we are willing to bet the office harp and the
business-manager’s halo that nobody lends a
helping hand to anybody down there.
Some day or other the Australian Natives
Association may possibly realise that there is
something humorous and grotesque about its
existence, and when it begins to understand
itself it will crack up ignominiously. There
must be a dreadful scarcity of humour about
the born Australian, else the “ Natives ” would
have died very young. The man who attempted
to get up a French Natives Association in Paris
—thus admitting that they were only living on
sufferance in a foreign land—or a league of
British natives in Birmingham, would have
to escape in disguise in order to get away
from public ridicule ; but the Australian
solemnly gathers himself together, day after
day, to celebrate the astonishing fact that he
was born in his own country, and it never
occurs to him that almost everybody else is
born in his own country likewise, so that the
fact over which he whoops is more common
than grass, and a great deal less surprising than
damp water. The “ Native,” in fact, raises a
monument to commemorate the astounding cir-
cumstance that he is himself, instead of being
some other fellow, and that he was created
where lie was instead of being created in some
other place, and it doesn’t dawn on his compre-
hension that every other human being on all
the earth is in exactly the same situation, and
that everybody ought to whoop and celebrate
and commemorate and let off fireworks for
exactly the same reason. If the Australian
Native had been born in Europe, or if he was a
black Frenchman of Irish parents who came
from Germany and he had first seen the light
in Greece, there might be something sufficiently
surprising about it to be worth screaming over,
but the man who organises himself simply
because he is the son of his own parents and
was born in the country that he belongs to (and
that should belong to him even if it doesn’t
happen to do so) is exciting himself in a way
that is quite unnecessary.
Dear Bulletin, — You say the honorary magis-
trate system is rotten. Agreed. The stipen-
diary system, not properly supervised, is
equally bad. Some few years ago a N.S. Wales
Stipendiary Magistrate was holding Court
(liquored up, as usual). The case before him was
drunkenness, and, on the prisoner pleading “ I
s’pose 1 was drunk,” his Worship serenely pro-
ceeded to pass the sentence of death. Although
remonstrated with, he adhered to the sentence,
and ordered the prisoner to lie removed. When
a criminal case was to be tried, he generally
held Court in the open air—so that the people
might avail themselves of the treat, he said.
Sitting on his own verandah, he would pass
judgment, usually whilst in a state of inebria-
tion. Eventually the thing became so palpable
that steps were taken which resulted in his
removal to another town as 0.P.5., which
position he held till quite recently, when death
claimed him at the end of a prolonged drinking-
bout. ll. W.

Some weeks ago Justice Williams (Vic.) sen-
tenced a man to live years’ penal servitude and
two Hoggings for an assault upon a woman.
The evidence tendered was that of the woman
only. Enquiry made by the Minister for Jus-
tice into the character of the prosecutrix has
resulted in the hoggings being remitted and the
five years reduced to one. Now, the woman
was either a consenting party or she was not.
If she was, the prisoner is legally altogether
guiltless and should be set free, as was Buttner
on the day hxed for his execution at Sydney ;
if she was not, he is altogether guilty, and
should be kept in gaol for the term of his sen-
tence, for the complaint is not that the sentence
was excessive or unusual, but that the man was
not guilty. In the present case, the woman is
proved to have gone in a cab with the accused
to the house where the assault muxs said to have
been committed, and only made complaint when
challenged for being out late at night. The
man’s detention is a sop thrown to the Law (so
that it shall not appear an utter idiot) and to
Mrs. Grundy.

Professor Marshall Hall has induced Mel’
bourne University Council to endorse his sugges
tion that nobody can take the degree of
Bachelor of Music in Melbourne until he has
first passed an examination in German —an
exam, so rigid that a student must be able to
read German and translate it into English at
sight. Why not Italian and French as well ?
This broad idea might be still further widened.
Let Melbourne University refuse to grant
diplomas to medical men w'ho have not pre-
viously acquired the degree of Bachelor of
Trapeze at a licensed gymnasium. A legal
student again might be required to first graduate
Master of “Sh duffing ” under a certificated
Chinese cook before being granted a permit to
study for the Bar. Young men proposing to
qualify as architects might be compelled to pass
a rigid exam, in swimming. Similarly, intend-
ing civil engineers might be made to qualify
first in midwifery, and embryonic clergymen in
book-keeping by double (and every other church)
entry. In fact, the field is illimitable.
The Bulletin can understand the proposal to
erect a statue in Post-office Place, Sydney, to
the memory of that robust man, the late Chief
Justice Martin, though it fails to see any other
reason for christening the Place in question
“ Martin ’’-place (instead of Wentworth-place)
than that the name of Wentworth is already
sufficiently commemorated on the map of the
province. But a statue to “ Slippery-CiiARLiE ”
Cowper —bah ! Cowper was a most common-
place person, and the only reason for raising a
statue to him at the public expense can be that
it is desired to prevent his memory from slip-
ping into utter oblivion, like that of many
another small and hopelessly prosaic politician.
The rule should lie that the memory shall
advertise the statue, and not the statue adver-
tise the memory. We don’t think much of a
system wdiich practically enables a single in-
dividual to put his hand into the public
Treasury and pull out enough money to buy
brass in order that effigies of his political
associates and contemporaries may be adver-
tised to a world which was likely to forget that
they had ever lived. We have read and heard
a lot about the late Mr. Cowper, and yet we
only know one remarkable thing about him :
when pestered by a billet-hunter he would put
his skinny hand into his coat-tail pocket and
produce a bundle of papers. “ Look here, my
good man, I can give you nothing,” he would
say. “ See ! I have even got 50 applications
for the assistant-hangmanship.”
*.
Dear Bulletin, — It is obvious that among
those institutions which have survived the pur-
poses for which they were created must now be
reckoned Trades-Unionism. Man being, how-
ever, in most cases, a mere slave to custom,
cherishes any effete legacy of the past, and
rarely exercises the slightest thought as to its
desirability, wherefore we find the world defer-
ring to grossly inapplicable laws. In many cases,
by the time that a long-desired reform is
actually accomplished it is only half useful and
the benefit is trivial owing to the difference of
surrounding circumstances in society at various
intervals. The accumulation of coppers by the
masses into what they term a defence fund is
too puerile to need comment. Now that Capital
has organised its forces, Trades-Unionism
perishes as 'an active power for benefiting its
votaries. Its sole nse will now be that it will
serve as a kind of club where all workers may
meet and discuss affairs relating to themselves.
The Ballot-box will in future be the weapon of
the proletarian, and now and again where
aggressive Capital drives too far a little healthy
anarchism will keep the balance from toppling
over. —Junor.
Melbourne Argus recently assumed the role
of a pitying critic towards “the deplorable
excesses and political instability of revolution-
ary South American States. Commercial specu-
lation is seriously affected, and the insecurity
of capital militates materially against the hap-
piness and industry of these foolish Repub-
licans.” We are not altogether so sure about
this. In an outsider who has never enjoyed the
intoxicating pleasure of repudiating a long and
burdensome foreign loan, originally incurred for
sinister purposes, an inability to appreciate its
exhilarating effects may be pardonable. Then
the sense of equality and brotherhood which
fluctuating individual successes and reverses
engender is eminently calculated to repress any
undue exhibitions of “ side ” or highhandedness
in the powers of the day. The knowledge that
to-morrow a party may break into your bed-
room, trot you out into the plaza, make a rifle-
target of your person, and appoint one of their
number to take over your billet with all emolu j
nients and privileges pertaining thereto, induces
a spirit of toleration and kinship with the rank-
and-file of society which is quite unknown in
more sedate constitutional countries. Then,
again, the splendid opportunity which a period!
cal riot affords for wiping out old grievances dl
oppressive debts more than compensates the
temporary inconvenience of remaining unem-
ployed while business operations are suspended,
further, the upshot of each revolution is that
some crying abuse is remedied, and although a
deal of noise is created and a few reckless
individuals go under, it is better that things
should take this course than that a nation
should have to wait for a couple of centuries
before an evil is constitutionally suppressed
rew guns or swords decay from rust in South
America, and it is some consolation to know
that the national funds are not wasted on use-
less toys. There are many other favourable
features in connection with this subject, but
the main principle underlying the lot is that
sometimes even the most violent convulsions
are infinitely preferable to mouldering stag-
nation,
--
The case of the clergyman lately brought
before the Melbourne bench charged with
stealing a novel from the Public Library and
discharged on account of his evident respecta-
bility, like that of several other genteel
defendants in similar case and similar
luck, evokes certain reflections. If it be
assumed as an incontrovertible axiom that a
professional man, although not in the best of
pecuniary circumstances, cannot be held actuated
by felonious intent in such a case, then the general
public is entitled to know which are the voca-
tions which will ensure immunity from prose-
cution in the event of their feeling inclined to
borrow other people's property for an indefinite
period. There can be little doubt that the
reverend one had no idea of stealing the giddy
Volume iu question, but where the decision
given in his case is open to serious objection is
that the bench apparently exonerated him from
blame solely because he was a professional man.
If this reasoning is to be accepted as a basis for
precedent, the lawyer, soldier, doctor, sailor or
civil-service employe must also claim exemption
from legal control; and as this is a democratic
country, not only will the heads of the various
professions demand this right, but also the
lowest members of these social departments.
The next hank-clerk who borrows a couple of
thousand out of the office safe will calmly assert
his non-culpability. Being a member of the
banking profession, how can anyone hold him
guilty of felonious intent so long as his people
refund his defalcations ?
Tkuth (London) has been ridiculing the names
bestowed by Administrator Macgregor on the
prominent physical features of New Guinea.
Truth is right, though Macgregor has an
apologist in Sydney in the person of another
unimaginative Scotchman who runs the local
Echo. For instance, Mac. has christened a
huge New Guinea mountain “Mount Foshery ”
—Fosbery happening to he the name of a
Sydney police-officer who chances to be a
pal of his. He discovers in a mysteri-
ous country a colossal mountain which
dates from the beginning of time—and he
straightway names it after an offensive police-
man who watches the Sydney publichouses to
see that tlie public don’t buy a drink on Sunday.
We are as sorry for Mount Foshery as we are
for the African Albert Edward Nyanza, the
mighty lake which, after it had defied for
scores of centuries the curiosity of man, hook-
canvasser Stanley profaned by making it the
godchild of a coarse, squat German man with a
big stomach and a bald head,
W. E. Smith, the wholesale manufactur-
ing stationer, of Bridge-street, Sydney, has ex-
tended operations as manufacturing stationer and
printer to Hunter-street, Newcastle.
The immediate predecessor of the now-
celebrated Mr. Patsy O’Connor in the Bulli
(N.S.W.) O.P.S.ship received an annual salary of
£11)0. Why is Patsy only to get £l5O as “ Acting”
C.P.S.? When the brother-in-law of the present
Minister for Justice was appointed aC.P.S. by
the Minister aforesaid, in October, 1888, the
former was also appointed an Acting C.P.S. at an
annual salary of £l5O at an out-of-the-way place
called Copeland. Mr. Maitland, like Mr. Patsy
O'Connor, had not previously been in the Civil
Service, but in December, 1880 he was promoted
to a Police Magistracy and Clerk of Petty Ses-
sions-ship at Milparinka, TJie duties of C.jP.S,
can now, it has been discovered, be performed by
the police office at Copeland !
Mr. Zichy Woinarski, who died the other
day in Melbourne, was one of the heroes of the
Hungarian war of independence in 1818, and
fought in eighteen battles during that much-
blundered outburst. Like Kossuth he was ap
ardent Republican. The Hungarians in these
days had a very wild idea of liberty. The poor
weak Austrian Emperor conceded everything
they asked for themselves, and then they rose in
frenzied insurrection to defend their inalienable
privilege of jumping on the Croats with both feet,
because they couldn’t understand that a Croat
wanted anything at all. Nine-tenths of their
army consisted of noblemen and their hangers-on,
who were lighting for their divine right of paying
no taxes, and owning all the land, and kicking
everybody who wasn’t a nobleman, and the other
tenth consisted of Republicans who would probably
have been hung afterwards by the bosses of the
nation for suggesting that a person who -wasn’t a
peer had a right to do anything but grovel on all
fours. They were led by two of the beet com-
manders on earth, but one of them, Georgei, was
an aristocrat who turned traitor ; and the other,
Bern, was a Republican who was looked down
upon by the Magyars because he was only a
beastly Pole, and consequently, whenever things
looked absolutely hojHiless, or wherever the
tattered insurgents were being borne down by
stupendous odds, they put Bern in front, and felt
bad because that objectionable democrat wasn’t
killed. Ami finally, when the great chance was
fooled away, 11 ay nan proceeded jp flog the
Magyar potentates and their wives and daughters
in a lavish way, because he didn’t respect a
Hungarian nobleman worth a cent, and had no
regard for any man of pedigree except himself.


[?]
848 Maoquarie-street North, Sydney, Feb. 18,1891.
Mv Dear Mooradinda, —
The Countess of Jersey—the real official representative
of Her Majesty (and, when you come to think of it, who
can represent a woman as well as a woman ?)—has reached
Australia at last, and, though she must glide into Govern-
ment House in as “ penny plain ” a manner as possible,
according to the statoot, still there will be a triumphal
arch at AlDury and a gaping throng at Redforn to assure
her — well, that sometimes the tail does wag the dog.
Lady Jersey seems to be in no hurry to reach Sydney, for
she will stay' at Melbourne Government House and will
come on just when the whim seizes her. At least, that is
her reported progress, which is probably set forth to main-
tain the dreary fiction that it doesn’t matter when a
governor’s wife arrives, though why she should come
full tilt from Adelaide per express isn’t explained. The
dutiful Earl will meet her and the four scions, and a short
visit will be paid to Sutton Forrest, just to enable Lord
Jersey to break some of the horrors of the situation to his
haughty Primrose dame. Captain Leigh—Lady Jersey’s
brother—will accompany the Countess from Melbourne.
It doesn’t seem as if Lord Jersey appreciates high-class
music. Though he went to the “Dick Whittington”
pantomime, which was starred with “Little Annie
Rooney,” et hoc genus omne, he did not patronise the
“ Golden Legend ” by the Philharmonicans, and now he
has refused to attend a classical concert given in the
big Town Hall by leading Sydney musicians. If Jersey
is going to play the invisible Tory he will have to begin on
the shingles of society.
It is an interesting sight to see how a certain adipose
professional, whose waist is a Sabbath-day’s journey from
hook to hook, takes care to engage a supe. who is larger
and fatter than herself, and whose billet is principally to
overshadow the leading lady'; the latter, of course, doesn’t
suffer in consequence. The actress’s bane is adipose
tissue—and yet the scrag who turns up a neck like a
duck’s hind leg, and whose bared arms suggest gas-pipes
at a hundred yards is enough to damp the spirits of the
entire audience. Still they all like to he slim ; as the
frockist says, “ You can add what you like, ma’am, but
you cannot take away.” Why don’t those Thespiennes
give up their oysters and porter?
The Earl of Jersey flits to Bowral on 21st inst. to open
the Bowral and Moss Vale Club—the roll-book of which
includes the names of several Sydney gentlemen who
abide in the Doctors’ Paradise half the year. There is a
hope that Lady Jersey may accompany her liege on thi 8
occasion.
It will soon become fashionable for men to go to church
if Lord Jersey maintains such a brisk attendance at the
sanctuaries as he is keeping up now. Once in the week
isn’t enough for the Earl, who went to the Cathedral in
great state on Ash Wednesday. But the real test is what
did his Excellency dine upon when he reached home?
And did his religious fervour extend to cold fish and pan-
cakes ?
“ Mrs. Yell and infant ” appear ominously in the list of
passengers by an outgoing English mail-boat, but wouldn’t
it have been more in accordance with the eternal fitness
if they had entered it “Mrs. and Infant Yell?” The same
boat has the honour of carrying a lady hilled as “ Miss
Blank Blank, nurse, and infant.” This is only one of the
penalties a good-natured girl pays when she undertakes
to chaperone her youngest niece aross the mill-pond.
There is a sound as of a long, loud shriek of female
indignation among the lady candidates for Inland China
honours, a parcel of whom we shipped off to Melbourne
the other day to be judged—it was understood—purely
on their theological merits by the Melbourne examiners.
Scarcely had they arrived at the wharf than two Anglican
clerics sailed up the gangway, and, without putting any-
body over their biblical jumps, so to speak, selected one
young lady and bore her off in triumph, to the amazement
of the rest. The examinations were a farce throughout,
and nobody was surprised when the favoured one came
out apostolically on top, with the rest of the would-be-
elect nowhere.
Here is an advertisement calculated to take away the
breath of the serious young lady, whose only earthly
ambition is to be annexed by a beauteous curate, with
No. 7 feet, who will shelter her from the cold blasts of a
cruel world in a rose-covered parsonage, &c., &c. ;
\ CLERGYMAN’S wife, who has had much experi-
-cV. ence in nursing typhoid fever, diphtheria, and
scarlet fever, is open to Engagement.—Dora, G.P.O.
Up to date, it has only been “Clergyman’s widow” who
has had to scratch for herself (since the common or garden
Rev. Samuel Smiffkins never leaves enough behind him to
keep his family in salt) but now it seems as if the support-
ing pow’ers of the third sex aren’t built to last a lifetime.
Let the anxious enquirer who is at present engaged on a
pair of woolwork braces for the new curate assimilate this
dismal fact before she draws another thread.
Smuggling is an expensive wickedness when you are
caught/ An unlucky Melbourne draper was recently
made to forfeit a bundle of Maltese lace, valued at ever
so much, with a further fine of three times the amount of
duty, not to speak of the “ professional” agony of seeing
a bundle of real lace confiscated by the Customs House
bogie-man. And only the other day a well-known ex-
rink-nianager was gone through at Wodonga and relieved
of four gold watches to the great amusement of the other
passengers.
But the boss smugglists are the stewardesses. One of
them has a “ system ” of bringing into Victoria a contra-
band cargo of feathers and lace every trip which she
disposes of to a loyal clientele, who wouldn’t give her
away for the world; and as she occasionally vaiF„
the monotony with cigars, the easy-going hus-
bands affect to laugh at the whole thing, you knew, and
get their smokes at sacrifice rates. Many and ingenious
are the ways in which she gets her smuggles ashore
One day she was ushered into a drawing-room, neatly
gloved and bonnetted, with not a vestige of parcel any-
where. “I hope you’ve brought me something nice,”
said the lady of the house, and then the unexpected
happened. Off came her bonnet, and some webby' lace-
handkerchiefs came out from between the lining and the
crown, and off came the Jaced-up boots, revealing a
rather flat instep after two soft parcels had been
taken out and unwound into yards of enchanting lace.
A cold-hungry time is setting in for wedding-guests,
and the visitor who has blossomed forth in a big cheque
and a piano is turned loose upon a “buffet ” covered with
sticky' “delicacies,” and sometimes not even that—the
refreshment consisting of the reception the happy pair
hold after the return from church, with, perhaps, a
dubious sandwich thrown in, since sit-down breakfasts
are considered bad form. Some people furnish the dreary
stand-up feed with a certain amount of toothsomeness,
but this is not an era when your hostess goes to any
greater expense than she need, and the leathern custard-
ball, the limp coffee, and the menacing cold “ chicken ”
are threatening the digestions of the chief mourners in
the scenes of blushes and old slippers. The only thing
that ought to go, but seems to have become a petrified
system, is the heavy, gritty, tomb-topped wedding-cake.
Is it becoming fashionable to display the bridegroom’s
presents along with those of the bride, or was the fact
that a recent list of wedding-gifts included two spirit-
stands and a silver cigarette-case merely an airy way of
saying that the lady ?
Doctor Carver’s “Wild America” Show, close by the
Zoo, in Moore Park, is one of the most thrilling and
realistic spectacles that I have ever sat out—from the
hazel-eyed Doctor himself, with his jubilee-red shirt and
wonderful shooting feats, down to the smallest papoose (a
society lady behind me on the grand-stand called it
“caboose”) in its beads and wampum. There was but
one lady Indian in camp—Mrs. Black Bear, wife of a swell
Sioux chief—and her mode of gettting up her really hand-
some face for the ring was reminiscent of pea-soup and
tomatoes : the whole visage was yellow-ochred, and each
cheek (even as a barbarian, woman knows just where to
lay on the brush) was coloured a deep, ballet-girl red.
After the performance the audience meandered amongst
the wigwams, which are painted by the Injuns with all
sorts of signs and symbols. One picture shows a degener-
ate pale-face flirting with a squaw in what looks like a
gin-bottle done in patchwork, while Nemesis, in the shape
of a redskin equivalent to the “hubby” of civilisation,
sneaks up at the end of a gun with which he destroys the
destroyer of his happiness. In this wasteful way does the
poor, ignorant savage get even with the other fellow.
Why' doesn’t some good kind missionary skip along and
enlighten him in the soothing, civilised doctrine of
damages ?
Local sassiety will not fall in love with the cowboys in
the Wild America show. They are small men, mostly,
and wear their back hair too degage for a nation that
bows down before the gaol-crop. Also, they haven’t
lovely moustaches to speak of, and they don’t swagger
worth a cent, neither do they cast bold glances into the
fine five-shilling seats, nor would their names on the
programme inspire the susceptible schoolgirl to cut out
and put them under her pillow. But they look more
romantic than the Australians in the show, who wear
boiled shirts (the genuine cowboy despises a man in a
boiled shirt), and one of them jarred the unities by dancing
round the ring in a hard felt hat! If any tender female
heart yearns for anything to worship, it will most probably
pass the cowboys and hurl the weight of its young-
affections at a massive Sioux chief with a red blanket
and a heart-breaking profile, who can’t speak a word of
English—but, of course, that wouldn’t signify.
The N.S.W. Minister for Education has received a
“ minnit ” from a suburban alderman pray ing that the
“ biys and gals” attending the local public school be
taught the art of swimming—so as to give the sharks and
snags a*chance on half-holidays, I suppose. One wonders
what will next be added to the curriculum at the State
schools. But they never institute a class for embyro
domestic servants, nor are the girls taught to become
6 ona-Udc one-pound-a-week cooks.
And, apropos to public school “ fax,” one can’t help
smiling cynically at the Don Quixote of the N.S.W. educa-
tional system having his personal prattlers taught at
home by a visiting governess. What was sauce for the
gander would be poison to the goslings seemingly'.
A dreadful experience happened to a N.S.W. hospital
matron who was perambulating through a ward one day,
followed by a priceless wheezing pet pug, and who paused
at the bedside of a dying Chinese. “ Is there anything
you would like ?” she asked, impelled by the same motive
that pervades Law and Justice when it allows the con-
demned convict what he fancies for breakfast, and the de
mortuis Celestial faintly allowed that there was. “ Tel]
me and I will send it,” said the lady unwisely, and then
came the horrible whisper; “All li—eatee that litee dog

Sydney is to have a National Juvenile Industrial Exhi-
bition at the Exhibition barn, P.A.P., commencing on
Easter Saturday and running till 11th of April ; and once
again the sobs of the disappointed competitors and the
indignant shrieks of the mothers of the same will waft
gently through the dailies. And the hated prize-winner,
who has spent £6 4s. Bd. on exhibit-carriage and has come
out at the other end with an evasively-worded certificate
and a copper medal, will want somebody with a soothing
manner to explain the attraction of the situation to him.
Jules Joubert (he doesn’t like to be called Joobert, by the
way) directs the outbreak, and the Countess of Jersey is
to be asked to set things going to a two-and-sixpenny
audience.
Quite the latest fad of the Apostles of Hygiene, who
see physical doom in a cucumber, and who regard bread
less than a week old as a sort of crusty felo-de-se—is the
aggressive onion, which is now worshipped as the only
specific for old age, false teeth, and every other form of
bodily decay. So now there will be something more than
her flat waist and her heelless square-toed boots to tell
the sanitary young woman by at sight. You will know it
is she by the way people will rush to windward when she
arises in the east.
The “ Separation ” waltz, by Charles Manby, of Towns-
ville, which reached me by a recent post, is the very
latest musical idea in North Queensland, and though it
does seem odd that the composer should introduce one or
two of De Beriot’s airs into what ought to be a purely
Australian inspiration, one forgives this freetrade in
harmony because the time is so good throughout. The
“ Separation ” waltz is one that would shine under the
heading of “ Buttercups and Daisies” in an instruction-
book, but it lacks the vigour the subject should have in*
spired in the bosom of a Tovvnsvillian.
If all “Jilts” dress as well as Fanny Enson does in the
name-part, at the Criterion, their mittened suitors would
console themselves by totting up the amount they save
annually in clothes-bills. Enson’s prettiest gowns are a
pale-pink brocade bodice and train, the jupe draped in
pink chiffon, the edges finished with gold braid; a
heliotrope velvet and chiffon race dress with tiny bonnet
on suite topped with heliotrope ; and a pale-pink bodice
and train designed in floral flowers, the jupe covered with
white chiffon ; sleeves of the chiffon and Medici loilar
lined with ruby velvet. Mrs. Brough, who made a dainty
Kitty Woodstock, was nicest in a sulphur-coloured brocade
bodice and train, the skirt bouffant and held down by
panels of the brocade, berthe of sulphur chiffon and
diamond ornaments ; a white voile with striped satin vest
and white hat and feathers ; and the simple ultramarine
blue silk walking gown with blue velvet beet, hat trimmed
with yellow asters, of the third act. There was a crowded
house at the second performance on 16th inst., including
a sort of ecoleastical theatre-party, the leading chaperone
of which wore her hands au naturel —but, of course, her
diamond rings were really' lovely'.
Yours affectionately,

The marriage of Miss Ida Campbell, sixth daughter of
Hon. Alexander Campbell, M.L.C., with Mr. Reginald
Bloxsome, one time secretary to Lord Loftus, took place
at Mort’s Church, Woollahra on sth inst., in the
presence of a large wedding-party. The church was a
floral bower, a large bell being a feature of the decora-
tions, the prevailing tones of which were subdued. The
bride was simply attired in white embroidered muslin
with white sash, the skirt cut walking length;
dainty white hat trimmed with chiffon and heather
bouquet of souvenir and blush roses and leaves tied
with white ribbons ; the one maid (Miss Laura Campbell)
wearing doru guipure and heliotrope ribbons, hat
en suite. The reception and breakfast were held at
Rosemount, the residence of the bride’s parents, after
which Mr. and Mrs. Bloxsome left for Ranger’s Valley,
New England. The going-away dress was of fawn tweed
with ivory silk blouse and pink tie ; small sailor hat.
The Australian Club (whose brand-new habitat, at the
corner of Macquarie and Bent-streets, is painfully like a
well-meaning coffee-palace) entertained Earl Jersey, a
handful of aides-de-camp, and Mr. Fuller, a guest at
Government House, at dinner on 10th inst. The orgies
were rather formal, and during the evening Lord Jersey
consented to become a member of the club.
Mayoress Burdekin chaperoned a large theatre-party to
the Criterion on 9th inst. Mrs. Burdekin wore sunflower
yellow silk and diamond ornaments ; Miss Nellie Hill was
a vision in filmy white with touches of pink ; Miss Burde-
kin also wore white, and Miss Bloomfield a grandmotherly
gown of stiff cream brocade. The gentlemen of the party
included Hon. Rupert Leigh, A.D.C.
Hon. W. Suttor and his large family of daughters have
taken up their residence in Sydney.

Toby Barton, Q.C., has lately worn an
injured expression, suggestive of wounded amour-
propre. Robert Richardson, a cocky young man
who, like a shilling draper, has always got all his
intellectual goods on the counter, lately sent out
from Edinburgh to Sydney Echo a parody on
Longfellow’s “Excelsior” entitled “Up’ards,”
“by Robert Richardson and Edmund Barton,”
which appeared in the Sydney Punch of 1867.
No more unfunny and ill-constructed parody on a
fine piece of verse was ever contumeliously thrown
into an editorial dirt-box. Mr, Barton is only
alleged by Mr. Richardson, 8.A., to be respon-
sible for one verse of “ Up’ards,” which is lucky,
as if he were found guilty of a verse and a half of
such ghastly idiocy a hopeless blight would fall
upon his business as a lawyer. Mr. Richardson
(B. A.) says he feels very sore at heart that when
“Up’ards” was quoted by Parson Be van, in
Sydney, it was attributed by him to “an Ameri-
can author.” With a view of showing the sort of
humourless toramyrot affected by Richardson,
8.A., Parson Bevan, and the “ American author,”
let us give “ Up’ards ” in its entirety :
UP' ARDS.
(By Robert Richardson and Edmund Barton.) *
A cold dark night was a-comin’ down
As a young man pass’d through a backwoods town ;
In his fist he clutch’d a tatter’d flag,
An’ this yere motter was on the rag—
“ Up’ards!”
From under his old tile’s ragged rim
His dark eye flasht like a tallow glim ;
And like a penny whistle rung
The accents of his Yankee tongue—
“ Up’ards!”
Thrice through windows did he see
Three sevril families takin’ tea ;
He smelt the corncakes, yet never swerved,
But sadly to himself observ’d—
“ Up’ards !”
An old man holler’d, “ Young feller, tak oar’,
Thar’s a rotten old pine tree right up thar’ ;
You’re a dead gone coon if it falls on your head.”
The young man merely winkt and said—
“ Up’ards !”
A pretty little girl cried, “Stay, oh, stay,
And you mayjnarry me straight away ;
Adown his nose a tear did flow :
“No use, young woman, I’m flxt to go
Up’ards !”
About tea-time the follerin’ day
A pedlar chanct to pass that way,
When he suddenly thought he heard a coon
Remarkin’ to a pensiv’ toon—
“ Up’ards !”
His dog then rummag’d and snuffd-about,
And discover’d soon what, beyond all doubt,
Was that poor young man, as cold as ice,
Who carried that flag with that rum device—
“ Up’ards!”
Tuckt up in a drift to his chin he lay,
In a rayther uncomf’table kinder way ;
But stooping low the pedlar heard
A sigh and one myster’ous word
“ Up’ards !”
Well, the pedlar carried that young man down,
And he took him back to his friends in town ;
And “ don’t weep,” said he, in a kindly tone,
“ For I guess this young man’s not yet gone
Up’ards!”
Laugh, ye wretches, laugh !
* We hope this latter assertion isn’t a criminal libel.—

Beautifully staged, the Monday night’s
performance of ‘ ‘ Arrah-na-Pogue, ” at Sydney Her
Majesty’s, was as long and tedious as the first
night of a Shakespearean production. Maggie
Moore, as Arrah (her brogue is simply beautiful),
is by turns witty, tender, pathetic, and fiery, all
with the utmost fidelity to nature, and her ren-
dering of the “Wearing of the Green,” with a
strong dramatic ending, was alone worth the
price of admission. George Rignold is all
right as the Post, but we don’t care much
for his Shaun. He interpolated an Irish word
or two when he’d time to think of it, and
they glared from the mass of English like the
widely-separated plums in boarding-school duff.
Here and there he was powerful, particularly
when he learnt that Beamish was the man sheltered
by his wife, but, throughout, he lacked the
devil-may-care spontaneity the character requires.
Harry Jewett is too large and too manly to depict
naturally the cowardly, cringing Michael Eeeney.
He did his best, but Nature would assert herself,
and his brogue was occasionally suggestive of the
“ Welsh fairy ’’ he handled so well in the “ Merry
Wives.” Arthur Greenaway, a perfect poem in
the dress of the period, is too subdued, lacks
the dash necessary for the MacCoul. Jack
Sweeney, bowld as a lion and purty as a
pratie - patch, played the O’Grady with the
air of a P.M.G. and a brogue that O’Connor
might envy. Edith Blande’s success as
Fanny Power was based on looks only, and her
“delicate taste of the brogue” was fitful and
tended chiefly in the direction of distorting vowel-
sounds. In smaller roles other folks were as bad
or as good as opportunity allowed, according to
their fitness for their parts, but the general impres-
sion was fluffy. A few nights’ run, however, will
rub off the corners and curtail the time of per-
formance by at least an hour. By the way, the
effect of the cabin-scene was much enhanced by
the engagement of John Coghlan, the Irish piper,
and the jig-dancing of Lucy Osborne.

“The Jilt” was greeted by a brim in ing-
over house at Sydney Criterion on Saturday night.
The plot is not remarkable for logic nor the situa-
tions for strength, and the racing allusions are
usually “a bit off;” nevertheless, the play will
stand comparison with either of its immediate
predecessors, and good acting may squeeze a fort-
night’s run oaf of it. The Mrs. Welter of Miss
Romer—a free and faithful impersonation of the
hard-headed, self-helping, straight-going York-
shirewoman, set off by a delightful dialect —is,
probably, the most ably-handled character. The
good-hearted and careless Geoff. Tudor is one of a
school that Dot Boucicault (he looks an ideal
jockey) has made peculiarly his own, and his
scenes with Patty Browne, the Phyllis, had all
the finish and dash that characterises their joint
“business.” Run on familiar lines, the Myles
O'Hara of George Titheradge has a lovely brogue
and is otherwise convincing. Arthur Lawrence’s
Daisy is a perfect study in make-up, gesture and
enunciation, and Cates’ Lord Marcus is an airy
villain of much acceptance. The Rev. Spooner of
Owen Harris, run on Thornton lines, is a feather
in the young actor’s cap, but he requires to be kept
down, here and there. Percy Lyndal and Fanny
Enson, as the Woodstocks, were, on the whole,
disappointing, and the Tudor of Trent Adams
was most brilliant when least in evidence.
“ Society,” usually accounted one of Robertson’s
weakest, is in rehearsal. By the way, the four
leading Sydney theatres are occupied by works
from Irish pens—Boucicault, Falconer, Wallace
and Fitzball.
** * *
At Sydney Garrick the Montague-Turner
Company opened on Saturday last with “ Mari-
tana,” when a music-loving houseful rushed the
theatre to welcome their old favourites, after an
operatic absence of seven years, and Treasurer
Smythe was reluctantly compelled to refuse
money. Annis Montague and Charles Turner
seem to have lost little of the freshness, purity
and vocal power that made them public idols then;
consequently, a repetition of former triumphs may
be expected. Natural and consonant acting
wedded to inspired singing kept the audience at
white heat, and encores and floral offerings fol-
lowed all the principal items. Lazarillo was well
sung by Cicely Staunton, who secured several
encores, but her acting was, in places, expression-
less. Warwick Gainor was Don Jose, and his
fine voice was at its best in “ Oh, ray courage now
regaining,” which made amends for the stiffness
he had previously exhibited. Save in respect of
mechanical singing, Fred. England cannot be
commended for his King of Spain, and need not
be yet awhile afraid of losing himself in his im-
personation. A. F. Magney, as the Marquis, and
Miss Whitmore as his Marchioness, were equal to
the demands made upon them, and the minor
parts were capably undertaken by Harry Craig,
W. P. Morrison, and others. A capital little
orchestra was ably conducted by Rivers All press
(the Turners’ old conductor), M. do Willirnoff
being leader. The opera was well mounted, taking
into consideration the lack of stage-room. “11
Trovatore ” will follow “ Maritana ” —perhaps on
Saturday night.
* *■ * *
“Eileen Oge” was substituted at Syd-
ney Royal on Saturday night for “The Irish
Detective,” the curtain rising on a crowded
Olympus and a fair number of “classifieds.”
“ Eileen Oge,” an emotional melodrama by
Edmund Falconer, has been previously played in
Sydney, years ago, and is an Irish stew of
rampant landlordism and victimised tenantry,
revolving round a beauteous colleen who inspires
general adoration. The peasant’s marriage with
Eileen is stopped right at its first plunge by
means of a warrant for his arrest, based on forgery
and other villainy, followed by imprisonment and
exile. Various vicissitudes follow, including
atttempted seduction and murder, and the design
ing landlord is just about to get spliced to Eileen,
when his arrest occurs, and virtue is rewarded
while the audience proceeds to tumble out directly
daylight is apparent through the other end of the
tunnelled plot. The scenery, by George Gordon,
is particularly fine, (’.specially “the vision.”


Grattan can’t be equalled as an Irish im-
personator, and it goes without saying that his
Bnan I arrell is as natural as art can make it.
‘ Young Dick ” Stewart, in playing Patrick
(J Donnell, the persecuted peasant-lover, made
Bon l® weepingly-pathetic situations
decidedly comical. Robert Inman, as Harry
was a passable wicked landlord; and J.
P, West, as an avaricious Scotch bailiff, was as
forcible as most of the other characters were weak.
George Melville’s Father Mahony, Capt. de
Burgh s Mr. Moriarty, and A. G. Boulton’s John
Ihomas were indifferent performances. 0. J.
Berkeley’s brief appearance as Tim the Penman
was Constance Deorwyn, in
the title vole* was uneven in her emotional inter-
pretations : Maud Appleton was underplaced in
the part of Norah O’Donnell; and Alice Deorwyn
was a sprightly maid-of-all-work as Bridget
Maguire. ‘Shin Fane” will be staged on Satur-
day evening.
** * *
Fully half as much money as was taken at
the doors was refused on the last night of “ The
Idler,” at Sydney Garrick, and, judging from
appearances, this play might have run on for two
or three weeks longer. Charles Cartwright, Sass,
and the other favourites were enthusiastically
applauded and recalled, and Olga Nethersole was
visibly affected by the sincerity and unanimity of
f‘ ie f ai " ew ®h. Circumstances will delay the staging
of The iortune of War,” and the company will
open their Melbourne season with “ The Middle-
man.”

At Coogee Aquarium, Parker havin'*
scored eight points to Donovan’s three in the
mounted sword contest, the latter testy person
began to cavil at the decisions of Captain
M Murdo, and finally refused to proceed, whereupon
the referee awarded the prize to Parker. Manager
Larmour has hung up a purse of £lOO for a fight
to a finish on the lawn between Bill Williams and
Fred Ryan, two back-block heavy weights who
previously met at Bathurst, on Saturday, 28th
February. Both are finely-built and determined
men, and Mr. Larmour expresses his willingness
to give a purse of £2OO for a go between the
winner and “Joe "Goddard who is also willing.
Messrs. Burden and Brinsmead are in active pre-
paration for their £lOO trophy-fight which takes
place at the Aquarium on March 7, in a twenty-
four foot ring.

Fernandez made his fourth ascension from
Bondi Aquarium, last Saturday, in presence of a
big crowd. The balloon was inflated inside 21
minutes, and the professor jumped, according to
some calculations, from an altitude of between
five and six thousand feet on to a fence. Return-
ing to the Aquarium full of barbs and covered
with glory, blood and sand, he received a purse of
sovereigns from the fairy paw of Alf. Wyburd,
and will be further benefited next Saturday. It
is reported that Alfred is about to resign. For
the sake of the sovereigns that sit behind the
seal-pond it is to be hoped that this is incorrect.
The wily Wyburd is the greatest hustler in the
Southern Hemisphere, and it would be mighty
hard to fill his place.
** * *
At Sydney School of Arts the company
has been further strengthened by the inclusion of
Harry Sullivan, an English comedian, and Tom
Thumb, said to be the largest dwarf extant.
Fanning and Tracey are still well to the fore, but
the Hugos have dropped out of the bill. The
management announce the expected arrival of a
consignment of American artistes by the in-
coming mail.

At the Toatro de Foli, Sydney, Harry
Rickards is doing payable business with a change
of programme all round. The season only lasts
another fortnight, then Rickards takes a rest in
the bosom of his family at Randwick, after three
years’ constant travelling and playing, ere pro-
ceeding to England, perhaps, through America,
to engage fresh talent.
** * *
“ The Miner’s Right,” as dramatised by
Messrs. Dampier and Garnet Walch for Mel-
bourne Alexandra, depends for success upon a
wild profusion of incidents and a liberal allow-
ance of Australian scenery and effects. The thin
thread of narrative which runs through four acts
is strong and visible to the naked eye, whilst a
short fifth act, or postscript, brings the curtain
down upon a striking bit of business and leaves
virtue in affluent circumstances at the bottom of a
gold-mine. Ralph Boldrewood, the author of the
novel, is not a brilliant dialogue-writer, neither
are Garnet Walch’s efforts in that direction likely
to bring him immortality, consequently the drama
shows a tendency to become tedious ’twixt events.
Although there are sufficient criminal offences in
this entertainment to support the heavy burden
of puerile, humourless talk, much of it should be
promptly expunged together with at least
half-a-dozen extraneous characters. Smart lines
alone can excuse the introduction of people
who have nothing to do with the case. Lacking
“snap” they had better withdraw themselves
entirely and allow the leading characters to get
along with their robberies and murders more
rapidly. The story itself has the all redeeming
merit of being strongest in the right place. It is
at the end of the third act that Dampier finds
himself talking to the corpse of Miss Lily, never
dreaming that the young woman’s happy despatch
has been accomplished during his brief absence
from her side. Presently the dear departed one,
rolling off the log where she lay, falls in a particu-
larly deadlike manner upon the sward, and Dam-
pier, with red gore upon his honest, horny hands,
suffers an inevitable arrest for murder. A subse-
quent trial scene, stage-managed on the lines of
that in “ Arrah-na-Pogue, ” is also cleverly worked
up to a strong climax. This murder-scene, and
the method of fixing the offence to the leading
villain, are cribbed from “My Partner,” facts
which will hardly excite criticism from Alexandra
audiences. More, indeed, might well be made of
Dampier’s discovery of the poor dead Lily. The
incident would bear to be written up, and longer
dwelt upon by the actor. Such acting oppor-
tunities as “The Miner’s Right” offers are well
enough looked after by the company for whom it
was arranged. The drama will run and prosper
in the land of its birth, being racy of the soil and
redolent of old days at the diggings.
** * *
<( At the Melbourne Princess’ the revived
“Yeomen of the Guard” ought to last for a
second week. Save in respect of orchestral un-
steadiness at some points and unnecessary vigour
at others, Saturday’s performance gained, on the
whole, by comparison with the show of two years
ago. Ryley could scarcely avoid being a more
bearable Sergeant Meryll than was Marnock, the
ponderous martyr to vibrata who lumped through
the part in the first instance. Miss Elsie Cameron,
as a fine contralto ami capable actress, enables
Dame Carruthers to take her proper position at
last. Formerly the Dame was either an inaudible
lady named Ameris, since dead, or a strong-voiced
supernumerary who tore her share of dialogue
to tatters with her teeth, like an amiable cannibal
discussing cold missionary. Howard Vernon and
Elton seem both to have put a finer polish upon
their original work, and Leumane gives far more
weight to his words than he used to, though, to
be sure, his rolling, nautical walk and mannerism
of singing, as though he were passing casual
remarks about the weather, show few signs of
abatement. Miss Ida Osborne, although rather
out of voice on Saturday, was the same old young
Phoebe, pleasing in a particularly pleasing
character, but still apt to lay too much emphasis
in too many places. Miss Flora Graupner, who
is acquiring the art of dressing her figure to the
best advantage, appears to find much favour as
the stroller Elsie, but more people than the
present writer are haunted by a suspicion that
Flora always converts a priraa-donna into
an elevated type of “singing-chambermaid.”
Another dose of “Gondoliers” follows “The
Yeoman,” this week or next.
** * *
Matters elsewhere stand as before.
“Skipped by the Light of the Moon” is not
another unparalleled success or overwhelming
triumph at the Opera House, but it draws fair
audiences and pleases them in an unconventional
way after they are drawn. The saddest feature
of this entertainment is its long, draggletail name,
which apparently satisfies the parties chiefly con-
cerned, otherwise they would have cut it down to
“Skipped by Moonlight,” or, better still, have
altered the thing to “On the Loose,” or “ Better
Halves,” “Bowled Out,” “Smash Up,” “The
Baby Chase,” “ Delirium Tremens,” or anything.
Life is too short for the busy world to think
seriously about a farce possessing as many names
as a German prince.
** m *
“ Doctor Bill,” in its fourth week, is still
blowing great guns at the Bijou, and appears to
fill the upper regions better than anything yet
produced in the new theatre. B. and B. produc-
tions, as a rule, are not eagerly rushed by the com-
mon herd, which likes to have its imagination
tickled by large green and yellow posters and
highly spiced advts. in the papers. “Doctor
Bill ” has some fine long posters outside and some
good broad jokes inside, whereby its all-round
popularity is accounted for. The upper-circle
religiously roars like a rhinoceros when Miss
Kemble seems to account for her neuralgia by the
fact that her husband is out so much at night.
And when Brough sententiously remarks that he
no longer does any of the things he did in his
bachelor days the gods drop big tears of laughter
unconfined upon the heads of the stalls. It is
announced, however, that the “Doctor Bill”
season must shortly terminate. Miss Achurch
and Co. will be coming along anon.
** * *
The Royal pant, is panting its last this
week, after enjoying a longer lease of popularity
than seemed possible at the outset. On Saturday
the Cartwright-Nethersole company make a first
appearance here in their Sydney success, “ The
Middleman.” The city having been overdone
with music and legs of late the new-comers are
sure of a good reception.
* * *
Programmes at the halls are about the
same as usual, with a little difference. The
Gaiety show has been winding up for several
weeks past, with a farcical sketch by Lance Len-
ton, who has now laid irreverent hands on “East
Lynne,” without considering that the sorrows of
dear Lady Isabel ought to make her sacred. He
has obviously missed a point, too—seeing that the
cruel jest had to be thrown off—in not persuading
Frank Clark to appear as poor little Willie. The
Waxworks has wisely taken from the Argus a
paragraph which was intended to be funny, and
is printing it as a serious puff. This device does
credit to Phil Stuart’s ingenuity, and should serve
as a wholesome warning to a journal which is
funny only in its most solemn moods. The
Oyclorama and other things are snorting away
satisfactorily.
** * *
The Bulletin’s announcement of the
coming event at Melbourne Royal was followed,
on Saturday last, by a manifesto from Mr. George
Coppin, and solemn paragraphs in the daily
journals, which latter always assume to let the
world into a secret after its disclosure in another
quarter. Nothing ever was, is, or can be until a
dreary old daily newspaper has said it.
At Poverty Point.
Mrs. Adelaide Stoneham, actress, well-known in Aus-
tralia, died in England last Christmas Eve, aged 69
mother of Stoneham, long in Dampier’s company, at
Melbourne, and of Miss Adelaide Stoneham, who used to
excel as a souorette and burlesque actress. Mrs. Stone-
ham acted old women, the same line as Mrs. Phillips, Mrs.
Wooldridge, Mrs. Crosby, and Mrs. C. Jones, but, of
course, she was a heroine once. Her latest achievement
is to prove the virtues of the Theatrical Fund, into which
she had paid £9O, but was necessitated to draw over
£6OO.
Tne very successful comedy, “Jane,” at London
Comedy, seems to be abominably coarse. It is by
Lestocq, and Sydney Grundy writes scathingly about it iir
the latest Era, also expressing his absolute “hate” of
Clement Scott, who cracks it up. Ledger, of the Era
cordially joins in the disgust excited by the breadth of
the piece.
“Dramaticus” writes: “A bit about Jimmy Cathcart
may be appreciated. What a fine, fresh, young fellow he
was when he came out, in London, with Chas. Kean’s
gorgeous Shakesperean revivals, and orated before the
Queen, at Windsor Castle! The great treat of his life
was coming to Melbourne with the Keans, and seeing his
charming and beloved sister, Mrs. Heir. With Bob
Heir Cathcart struck up an enthusiastie brotherhood,
though at rival houses they acted exactly the same
line—the lagos, Bassanios, and so on. Heir had to
second Barry Sullivan, in trying to pull down the
Keans and Cathcart, but after the show the Heirs used to
whip round from the Royal, and meet Cathcart at the
old Haymarket stage-door, Little Collins-street, near
Paddy’s market—old times, Rocks ! old times, Jake !
Thus one opera-singer of another, a contralto, by the
way : “ Veil. She ees porn in der gudder. Vat do you
vant vceth anyding bud gudderschnipe tones? She cimd
helb eet. She’s low.”
Ella Wheeler Wilcox occupies three-quarters of a
column to exposing the immorality of “Dr. Bill” in a
New York paper. The management don’t mind.
Garner and Williamson will take action, it is said, for
breach of contract against Muzzy. Another report says
that Garner and Musgrove will run the Princess Theatre
Co.
On the first night of Jerome K. Jerome’s “New Lamps
for Old,” at Daly's (N.Y.), when the curtain went up on a
gentleman reading a book which he declared, horrifledly,
to be the wickedest book he’d ever road, a voice from the
gallery enquired—“ Say, what is it?”
Emma Abbott, the American singer, a native of Chicago
and a pupil of Marohesi’s, died at Salt Lake City, early in
January, aged 40, or thereabouts. In 76 she made her
debut at Convent Garden in “ La Figlia de Reggimento,”
but seceded from the company owing to her refusal to
play Violetta in “La Traviata,” on the score of its im-
morality, an objection which she overcame in after years.
Emma Abbott will be long rememembered for the way in
which she stood up in a Nashville church (Ingersoll and

Says an Amurkan paper :—“John L. Sullivan is going

must have of American art—first, the Brown-Potter
coterie, and now John L!”
It was Frances Hodgson Burnett’s eldest son, Lionel,

Says a ’Frisco paper:—“ Inigo Tyrell, author and come-
dian, is in town from England and the East, en route for
Australia with two new plays, a leading man, and two
leading actresses.” From some facts that have come
under our notice we are prepared to bet that Tyrell won't
come.
Felix Tanner, the late starving man, says, according to
a contemp., he is now 1 Jib. heavier than when he com-
menced to fast, but that” his flesh seems to be numbed
and doesn’t bleed when cut. Also that his head is giddy,
his feet and legs swollen. Further that: “ I can see
nothing before me but to go for another fast as soon as I
can feed myself up for it, and as sure as I do it will ruin
me for life. But what can Ido ? People won’t give me a
trial in the boat, and I cannot bring myself out without
cash, so it is all that is left for me.” The unhappy Felix
must starve in order to live.

Alma Murray, the well-known English actress, is sur*
prised that Bellew, the credited author of “Hero and

parzer’s tragedy on the same subject. Miss Murray is
possessed of an adaptation of Grillparzer’s play, from the
pen of her husband, one Watson, hence the surprise.
Anyhow, the P.B. production in London will be fore-
stalled.
John L. Sullivan refuses to play the lover. He says : “ I
won’t make a fool of myself acting the love-sick swain.”
He also declares that he has no difficulty in memorising
his lines, but feels silly when practising gestures and
poses, and finds it almost impossible to control his voice,
having “ a tendency to bellow.” He further asserts that
“ I find it irksome to stand still on the stage. My legs
are forever attempting to take steps as one does when
facing an opponent in the ring, and I have to be on the
lookout continually to check this tendency on the part of
my understandings to back and fill. Not that lam con-
ceited enough to believe that I have the material in me
for the making of a Booth or a Salvini, but I want to
show the public that I have some brains besides a fair
share of muscle and a little more ability than the prize-
ring demands.” In the opinion of The Bulletin, John
has not now in him the makings of a Slavini, either.

Says a Yankee theatrical manager in an advance
“ ad.”;—“ There will be sixteen charming and shapely
young ladies on the stage arrayed in tights, which dis-
play to the best advantage their plump and rounded
limbs. Just think of it. Sixteen large and juicy chunks
of feminine voluptuousness. The studio scene from the
celebrated Clemenceau Case, in which the Countess Iza
poses nude before her artist-lover is one of the notable
features of the scene. This one scene alone is worth the
price of admission. There is, however, nothing that
could possibly offend the most fastidious.”
The leading London theatrical paper has a glowing
paragraph about Mr. M. Tier, “ the well-known Mel-
bourne entrepreneur,” having presented Miss Jessie
Phillips with a beautiful gold chain and diamond, ruby,
and emerald pendants, in recognition of her talents as a
serio-comic “on the eve of his return to Australia.”
Who’s this Tier ? We well enough know the Falstafflan
Leon Welby Tier, so long the ringmaster, and formerly a
smart clown of Burton’s circus, and we fancy he handled,
or engined, another kind of Burton, bitter but refreshing,
in Adelaide, but how on earth has he bloomed into the
rival of Williamson and Muzzy ? Perhaps he is bringing
out Irving, Bernhardt, Melba, or the Spotted Boy with
Two Heads.
“Captain Swift” has been recently revived at the Hay-

An enterprising Adelaide mother is exhibiting a “ kid ”

John L. Toole, England’s “funny” comedian, told an
Adelaide interviewer that Henry Irving badly wants to

Charles Warner, according to private advices, has no
intention of opening in Melbourne at Easter, as stated

with Australia to follow, probably opening in Sydney or
Melbourne about July.
A number of Parisian playwrights are seriously pro-
posing that the dramatic critics of the leading newspapers
shall be elected for a period of five years by a council of
authors. In Australia it is the theatrical managers who
desire to perpetrate the press-notices. Sometimes they
do run in a column of ungrammatical slush.

A young author was reading his piece before the
members of the Connklie Framjaise, when Got, the great
actor, fell sound asleep. The offended author complained
to the head of the Society that Got was grossly neglect-

was surely impossible for a sleeping member to give any
opinion at all. “Ah !” said the irrepressible G6t, with a
bland smile, “monsieur forgets that in a case like this

Dilke says that one result of the late

prejudices, for up Scone (N.S.W.) way lately a

Out of the fifty-two counties of California
there is not one that does not produce grapes. The
largest vineyard in the world—that of Senator
Leland Stanford—is in Tehama County, and con-
sists of 3,825 acres, or about 3,000,000 vines!
California also has the smallest vineyard in the
world—the one grape-vine in Santa Barbara
County, which is seventy years old, has a diameter
of one foot twelve inches from the ground, and
whose branches cover an area of 12,000 feet. This
one vine produces from 10,000 to 12,000 pounds of
grapes, and the old Mexican woman who planted
it used to have her Indian peons make wine from
these grapes by treading them with their bare feet.
It is believed that there are planted not less than
150,000 acres of vines in the State and in the
adjoining States. The amount exported to the
Eastern States and foreign countries will not fall
far short of 10,000,000 gallons this year.

Verses We Have Read.
The Midnight Visitor.
Whose steps are those ? Who cornea so late ?
Let me pome in, the door unlock.
’Tis midnight now ; my lonely gate
I open to no stranger’s knock.
Who art thou ? Speak ? Men call me Fame ;
To immortality I lead.
Pass, idle phantom of a name.
Listen again, and now take heed ;
’Twas false. My names are Song, Love, Art;
My poet, now unbar the door.
Art's dead. Song cannot touch my heart,
My once love’s name I chant no more.
Open, then now for, see, I stand,
Riches my name, with endless gold,
Gold, and your wish in either hand,
Too late—my youth you still withhold.
Then, if it must be, since the door
Stands shut, my last true name to know,
Men call me Death. Delay no more;
I bring the cure of every woe.
The door flies wide. Ah ! guest so wan,
Forgive the poor place where I dwell;
An ice-cold hearth, a heart-sick man,
Stand here to welcome thee full well.
—From the French of Henki Murgkr.
The poem beneath, like the charming
“Bannerman of the Dandenong,” published by
The Bulletin some weeks ago, is quoted from
“A Time and Times,” a collection of poems by
Alice Werner, a young London poetess (where did
she get her Australian experiences?), who has
lately published another book of verses entitled
“ The King of the Silver City.”—
DAWN.
It comes—it looms up in the darkness —
Something—I hardly know
Of a word, or a name to name it —•
But I feel it must be so ;
For a time of choice is coming
For weal or for woe.
The pulses of a nation,
Beating in fever and pain ;
The fever of woe and want —
The fever of greed and gain—
And the stars are reeling in heaven —
And the great sea moans for her slain.
In the stillness of my life
I hear the tramp afar
Of the armies marching
Under the morning star,
To the Armageddon battle,
Where the eagles are.
The days lie dark before me-
I know not what shall be,
But at midnight or at day dawn,
When the call comes unto me,
I am ready to rise and follow —
To the death-agony.
O, my people, my brothers !
God grant me to be true—
Ever true to His highest truth ! —
No great thing can I do;
But, firm as a faithful heart may love,
Ever I stand by you.
Yours—and I see God’s angel
Coming along the sky
With the garments rolled in blood,
And the steadfast eye—
And some say her name is Love,
And some, Liberty.
She comes—who will know her coming?
Or be ready her step to greet
When she comes with the blood on her brow
And the dust about her feet ?
Who will bravely drink of the bitter
Without a hope of the sweet ?
Let us be true—heart-loyal—
Ready what time she calls !
Justice and truth are met
To cast down the age-built walls.
Happy shall be the victors that day,
And blessed he who falls !
If we reckon the population of the globe
at 1,400,000,000 of human beings, there would be
room for them all on the frozen surface of the lake
of Constance, Switzerland, and the crush would
not be so very great either, as there would be a
space of four square feet for each person. If the
ice were to break and the whole human race were
t r hen to sink into the watery grave, the level of the
lake would only be raised six inches.
The ordinary pay for making match-boxes

No wonder the match-making companies pay!
No wonder the big firms who employ these women

what does it matter (asks a Radical paper) if, in
order to put on an extra 1 per cent., hundreds of
women are compelled to exist under conditions
which make life a mockery, pleasure a thing un-

of man against it.
A well-known Sydney artist tells a good
English story quite new to us. Many years ago a
meeting was held at Clapham, near London, to
take preliminary steps to erect a new Anglican
church. The first meeting was most enthusiastic,
and thousands of pounds were promised in the
room. Sir Gilbert Scott, the celebrated
architect, was written to and asked to supply a
sketch design for a £25,000 building. He did so,
and the sketch, an admirable one, was submitted
to a second meeting. By this time, however, the
enthusiasm had waned, and it was decided that
the architect should be requested to design a
somewhat less expensive building, which he con-
sented to do. Just then a great financial panic
intervened, and at a third meeting it was coh-
cluded to defer, for a time, the erection of the
church, and to ask Scott to make his fee as light
as possible under the circumstances. When he
sent in a bill for 200 guineas, the indignation of
the meeting, in which the bishop appeared to
concur, knew no bounds. “ What!” they
shrieked, “200 guineas for a couple of paltry
sketches !” The bishop was appointed to inter-
view Scott, which ho did, winding up his protest
with: “200 guineas for, perhaps, a day's work!
Why, I have amongst my curates a large number
of most estimable and intellectual men who have
to live, with their wives and families, on 100
guineas a year!" “My Lord,” said Scott, who
had patiently listened until the cleric had done,
“I am an architect—a bishop among architects.”

Tales of the Old Regime.
No 1.—Convict Jerrick’s Death-Mask.
(FOR THE RULLETIN.)
It is difficult to say at what pei’iods and in
what places the Old Regime reached perfection, so
near to that point of diabolism beyond which
devilishness could not further go, were New South
Wales at any time in the first forty years of the
century, Yandemonia at any time within the
first fifty, and Norfolk Island at any time within
the years 1788 to 1805, and 1826 to 1855. A tie of
imperial infamy linked the Administrators —
mark, the Administrators and not the subject-
peoples—of one epoch to those of another, and the
whole geographical area fanned by the miasmic
breath of the Penal System was encircled, so to
speak, by one unbroken principle of domination.
If, however, discrimination be insisted upon, we,
for ourselves, would be inclined to indicate
Port Arthur in V.D.L. in the “Early Thirties”
as the spot and the time when the Regime burst
into blood-red blossoms of unsurpassable beauty.
Beauty, that is, according to the notions of the
Colonial Authorities, and their masters, the
Eminent Statesmen of Downing-street.
At Port Arthur in the “ Early Thirties,” were,
for instance, first formulated those maxims of
penal science, by careful study of which—not to
mention less brilliant administrators—John Price
was enabled to render devoted service to his
Country. At Port Arthur in the “ Early Thirties ”
cruelty first became scientific. At other places
and at prior dates, the Regime, while never
deviating from its primary principle of sovereignty
—that the convict wai not human - had proceeded
after the Rule of Thumb. Hence it occasionally
erred ; now and then an official lapsed into the
grievous mistake —mistake ? let us not palter with
words, but say the sin ! —of supposing that a trans-
port retained the heart and brain of a man with
his outward semblance. At Port Arthur in the
“Early Thirties,” any such tendency to error was
corrected by local regulation. Cruelty was for
the first time scientifically organised with due re-
gard to a convict’s physical and mental character-
istics. Not that every convict was the subject of
this methodical treatment. There were some who
were cravens; others who were sneaks; others,
again, so thoroughly depraved that they would
barter their daughters’ honour for a fig of tobacco,
and a brother’s liberty for a glass of rum.
These were the exceptions—technically, the “ex-
empt.” The rule touched only the best, the most
man-like of the prisoners. An “exempt” could
always escape its operation by filling one of the
frequently-occurring vacancies on the staff of the
convict constabulary.
Now, this rule, stated briefly, was that a
prisoner, if a “ special ” transport—that is, of
superior education and training—was systematic-
ally put to the work likely to be farthest removed
from his instincts and aptitudes when free; if an
ordinary convict, to work xn excess of his strength
and capacity. And this is a rather important
part of the rule —punishment was entailed in the
event of failure to perform the allotted task. For
the first failure, a task and a-half was ordered
plus a flogging; for a second failure, a doubled
task and a doubled flogging ; for a third failure, a
trebled task and a trebled flogging; for a fourth
failui’e, a quadrupled task and a quadrupled
flogging. After the fourth failure, what was left
of the transport was almost invariably in hospital,
or reposing on “Dead Island,” or on its way to
earn a fee for Brother Dougherty, the Hobart
Town hangman. Beautifully exact in operation
(as became its scientific basis), the. reader will not
be surprised to learn that the rule seldom failed to
drive a prisoner utterly and completely to the
devil. This much by way of introduction.
* # #
The before-referred-to invention of the
Regime never received a happier illustration of
its utility than when it broke the refractory and
stubborn spirit, of Convict Benjamin derricks,
aged 23 years, per ship Marquess Wellesley.
There was this singular circumstance connected
with the case of Benjamin derricks—he was a
native of Sydney, notwithstanding that he was a
transport from England for forgery.
At least, the circumstance if not singular was
peculiar enough to draw the particular attention
of Doctor and Commandant Rossell to the trans-
port in question.
A cargo, newly landed from the Government
schooner, was being called over in that mighty
potentate’s presence. The cargo, some forty, were
nearly all Marquess Wellesley people, the ship
having swung to her moorings in the Derwent
just in time to allow of the transfer to the schooner,
ere the latter vessel was despatched to Tasman’s
Peninsula, of the more desperate portion of her
consignment. It was a mere chance that had
brought Dr. Rossell to the mustering-yard at this
juncture. Usually he made the acquaintance of
new comers the day after their arrival, when it
was his practice to personally allot their tasks
under the Local Regulation. This day, however,
his after-lunch stroll led him to the yard, instead
of along the Point Puer Road. In after years,
when enjoying in his comfortable villa in Camp-
bell Town, the pension which a Constitutional
Government continued to him after the demise of
the Old Regime, he used to wonder what impish
impulse had sent him to the yard that day. But
then, when the Doctor indulged in this specula-
tion, he was doting and pious, and very much
afraid of the Hereafter. At the period of the
muster, he was alert and intelligent, fearful of
nobody save Sir George Arthur and a certain
woman in Hobart Town, and in place of being
pious, was devoted to the Regime.
* * *
“Isaacs, Abraham, 50, London, Middlesex
Sessions, 14 years, ship’s number 73, colonial
number to be assigned, Marquess Wellesley,”
•ried the schooner captain from his list or mani-
fest.
“Right,” responded the Mustering-Warder,
who by that monosyllable gave an interim receipt
for the body and appurtenances—sundry chains
and so forth —of Abraham . Isaacs, a Hebrew
“ fence ” from Ratclitfe Highway. And the
Mustering-Warder motioned Mr. "Isaacs to pass
over from the “ cargo side ” to the “ Settlement
side” of the yard. “Isaacs, per Marquess
Wellesley, your number’s 2-5-9-3.”
The Jew passed over, cringing as he clanked,
and muttering, “2-5-9-3,” “2-S-9-3,” as he went.
Only a forty-eight-hour-old resident of Van-
demonia was Mr. Isaacs, but already he under-
stood that to forget his “colonial number ” was
to invite an introduction to the scourger.
Here the doctor entered the yard.
“The Com’dant,” exclaimed a Sub-overseei.
“ Prisoners—attention ! The Com’dant!” re-
peated the Mustering-Warder. “ Cap !” And
the cargo side “capped,” as did most of the
Settlement side—not all. For the officials’ backs
were towards Settlement side, and one or two
hardy spirits, the eye of Law and Order not being
upon them, asserted their independence by keeping
their hands stationary. “It is shocking to
learn,” wrote Lieut.-Colonel Mundy, “that some
convicts, from the moment of their landing, set
themselves in defiance to the regulations.” Fore-
doomed to a bad end were such men.
“Proceed, Mr. Brewer,”ordered the Comman-
dant. “This the schooner lot—Marquess Wel-
lesley ?”
“Yes, sir,” replied the Mustering-Warder, again
touching his peak. “A bad lot, sir, I b’leeve.”
“Ah! We’ll take the badness out of them, I

think, Brewer. But go on.”
“derricks, Benjamin, 23, Sydney, N.S.W. ;
Old Bailey Sessions, life, ship’s number 76,
colonial number unassigned, Marquess Wellesley,”
cried the schooner captain.
“Ri .” The Mustering-Warder had begun
to take delivery, when the keenly-observant and
acute-hearing Commandant interrupted.
“ Some mistake there,” he said. “Not Sydney,
surely? Interrogate the prisoner, Mr. Brewer.”
“ derricks, forward !”
A tall, lithe form, the virgin down marking
with a faint reddish line the pallid cheeks, shuffled
to the front of the cargo rank.
“ derricks, where were you born ?”
“ Sydney, Botany Bay,” was the answer.
“You he, pris’ner!” said the Commandant.
“Take off your cap when you speak to an
officer, pris’ner! ” said the warder, speaking
simultaneously with his superior.
“ I don’t lie, and I won’t take my cap off again.
I’ve capped three times already.” The prisoner
flushed, it might be with shame, it might be with
passion, as he made this daring speech.
“ Ho, ho! Here’s a young bantam-cock wants us
to trim off his spurs,” laughed the Commandant.
“You don’t lie, you won't take your cap off. But,
please the pigs, I say you do lie, and you shall
take your cap off. Now, cap ! ”
There was a nervous trembling of the convict’s
hands as he clutched a trouser-leg in each.
Beyond this, Dr. and Commandant Rossell re-
ceived no answer.
“Has he heard the Regulation ordering respect
to officers of the Establishment ? ’’
“ Yes, sir, ’twas read at last ship muster in the
Derwent, " replied the schooner skipper.
“By an officer of the Establishment, or ships
surgeon ? ”
“Muster-master Strode read it, sir.”
The evidence was sufficient to satisfy even that
rigidly-conscientious functionary, Commandant
Rossell.
“Give him twenty-five, Brewer, as soon as
you’ve cleared the schooner. We can’t begin too
early to discipline a precocious youngster like this.
Now, Brewer, ask him again where he was born.”
derricks flung back his head as an answer to
Warder Brewer’s question.
“Won’t speak, eh?” said the Commandant.
“ Got a copy of King’s Regulations handy,
Brewer ? ”
A copy of that ingenious compilation which
might not inappropriately have served as by-laws
for a Satanic council, was handy.
“ Read him, No. 40, Brewer.”
The command was obeyed. No. 40 ran—
“ Any such transported offender who shall not, on in-
terrogation hy a person in duly constituted authority as
to particulars of his identity, promptly and truly make
answer to each and all of the questions put to such
offender by such duly authorised person, shall he awarded
such punishment as in the discretion of such authorised
person shall be considered to meet the case.”
“ There, Benjamin derricks, do you hear that ?
But I don’t wish to be harsh.” (The Doctor be-
came humorously tender in tone,) “Come, be
advised, young man. You can’t fight the System.
Answer, truly and promptly, where you were
born. You know you can’t have been born in
Sydney as you’re transported from home.”
derricks began to break. He “capped,” and
said :
“ ’Fore God, sir, I was born in Sydney. At
least I was brought up there, and my mother lived
in the house where she said I was born in.”
“ Heavens !” said Dr. and Commandant Rossell
with something like a sigh, “ what a liar !” He
sighed again and went on: “I’m sorry, young
man, but the Regulations must be obeyed. Give
him another fifty, Brewer. It’s impossible he can
have been born in Sydney. He’s made a good
beginning. But, go on !”
“Where shall I say his native place is, sir?”
asked the Mustering-Warder. It was necessary,
you see, that the records should be exactly kept.
The only books that the System did not trouble
about keeping accurately were the “Punish-
ment,” “ Stores issued to Officers,” and “Officers’
Labour.” Life was too short to keep the first
properly; it would be insulting to the officers’
integrity, and injurious to their pockets, to keep
the second and third.
“Oh, say London, or anywhere; it doesn’t
matter. Now, go on—you’re losing time.”
“Did I give you your colonial number, pris’ner ?”
asked Brewer.
Young derricks’ face had taken a ghastly pale-
ness. It was white when he landed ; it wore now
the hue of a bleached shroud. Already, one would
think, he was getting admirably broken in. Never-
theless he remained mute.
The Commandant lost his temper.
“ What’s your number, young 'un ? ” he roared.
‘ By God, sir, we’ll find a way to your tongue.
String him, Brewer, string him at once and give
him the first ‘dozen.’ String him, I say ! ”
In those adyta penetralia of \ice, the hold and
the “waist ” of the Marquess Wellesley, derrick*
had taken frequent lessons in convicts’ slang. Ha
was, therefore, no stranger to the meaning of tha
term so viciously repeated by the Commandant.
With his flesh creeping, nerves twitching in anti-
cipation of the lash, he stammered out: —
“ Don’t flog me, sir, and I’ll speak. He didn’t
give me a number, sir.”
“Brewer!” Dr. Rossell turned to his subor-
dinate. _ Though the heavens should fall, he would
do justice. He would not punish a transport for
refusing to give his number, if no number had
been assigned him. But
“ I gave him his number, sir—No. 2594,” replied
Mr. Brewer.
“Of course you did —I remember now, I heard
you myself. Oh, you young reprobate ! ”
It pains us to have to throw an imputation of
inaccuracy on any gentleman of the Old Regime;
but we know Dr. Rossell was in error here. The
number he had heard was Abraham Isaacs’:
“No. 2593.” There was no one, however, to tell
the good Commandant so; and, in a few minutes,
the eloquence of the lash and the music of a young
man’s agony filled the muster-yard. Not all of Con-
vict derricks went over to the Settlement side that
day. Some of him clung to the cat’s tails, and
some of him strewed the ground at the foot of
the triangles, For the (logger was in good form,
and the floggee was rather plump on the back,
and tender flesh rent easily.

Thus was Convict derricks introduced to
the Regime. It was his happy fortune that the
acquaintance so begun did not last long.
Being, as we have hinted, a tender youth, it, of
course, took him some days to get over the first
scourging. Consequently, it was not deemed
expedient to give him his second dose of “fifty”
till the end of his second week, he having filled
in part of the interval by residence in hospital,
and the remainder by quarry-work.
Following out the ingenious application of the
Local Regulation, by which a convict was put to
the work for which he was least fitted, No. 2594,
who had been taken from a college study to a.
Newgate cell, was ordered to stone-hewing. He
was “ tasked ” to turn out, daily, a cubic measure-
ment of quarried stuff which experienced and
inured prisoners would have found it difficult to
furnish in the time. It was, then, not surprising
that Convict derricks’ folio in the “Register of
Task-work ” presented the following appearance
at the end of his first fortnight:—
[No. 2594.
Folio 1231.—Prisoner; Jebricks, Benjamin ; ship Mar
(juess Wellesley. Received from Hospital, 21/3/3;
- Transferred to Hospital, 1/4/3.
This transcription can only be understood
by a reference to the Punishment Book—the
“P.8.”0f the marginal notes.
On March 21, an entry in this still-extant volume
of delightful reading (as the fine old British gen-
tleman of the Regime period would consider it)
states that Benjamin derricks, No. 2594, Marquess
Wellesley, was presented by the Quarry Overseer
for neglecting to perform his stipulated task. In
consequence of its being his first quarry offence,
mercy and justice were linked together by the
sentence: “Reprimanded; half-rations for three
days ; task work to be doubled.” The ordinary
penalty would have been 25 lashes and a task-and-
a-half.
On the 22nd, by a gigantic effort, Benjamin
derricks, and so forth, doubtless encouraged
thereto by the sustaining force of a half-ration,
and peculiarly stimulated by the persuasive
geniality of a reprimand, managed, his gashed
back notwithstanding, to perform the feat of
extracting from the quarry-bed an aggregate mass
of stone measuring 04 cubic feet. Nevertheless,
he was again reported for punishment. He was
deficient by 152 cubic feet of his task.
On the 23rd, either the gashes on his back were
telling, or else the influence of a half-ration was
waning, or the reprimand lost something of its
persuasiveness, for only a paltry 27 feet repre-
sented Convict derricks’ exertions for the day.
By some remissness, his task, which should have
been 343 feet at the least, was allowed to stand at
216 feet, so that the deficiency on his day’s work
was only 189 feet, and not, as it should have been,
316 feet. But it didn't matter; he would have
been ordered no more than 100 lashes had he been
short 316 feet instead of 189 feet. He was due
for the 100, anyhow. So the punishment entry
was made accordingly.
The 24th was a Saturday—a half-time day.
The men had to bathe, shave, and wash their
clothing in the afternoon. Consequently, the task
imposed on our youthful friend was only the mere
trifle of 125 cubic feet or so. He should have been
getting accustomed to the sustaining power of the

8 ounce meal, the one-quarter (J) ounce soup, the 1
ounce salt, and the 6 uncooked ounces of meat (in-
cluding bone) which constituted his half-ration, but
he turned out no more than a contemptible nine
cubic feet. Of course he was presented. Equally,
of course, he was penalised for hia “ continued
contumacy ”in another 100 lashes. He said him-
self that he was in a fainting condition all day ; a
fellow-convict swore in support of Jerricks’
assertion that the ycung man had not strength to
drill, none to wield the spawl. But—he was given
the hundred. We do not know whether his wit-
ness was punished. The presumption is that he
was.
Sunday was a day to be kept “holy” by the
System, and as was appropriate to an officer of the
Regime, Dr. and Commandant Rossell was a
devout upholder of the Ten Commandments—for
the transport. With respect to himself, his
practice was erratic, particularly as to the
Seventh. But we have nothing to do with that
weakness of his in this story —save that we must
make a slight retrospective allusion. The Day,
we say, was kept holy. No unnecessary work was
done.
The Day was kept holy. Only Missionary
Mantin, the hospital doctor, the warders, and
the scourgers worked. The functions of these
classes were necessary on the Sabbath —particularly
thoseof the last-named. For, being a day of rest for
the mass of convicts, punishment in lashes, so far
as regarded breaches of task duty, having been
allowed to accumulate during the week, could bo
“ paid off” without any loss of working time.
It was Convict Jerricks’ first Sunday, and it
was made peculiarly holy to him.
First of all, there was the remanet of 50 from
the day of his landing.
Then there was Thursday’s contribution—so.
Then there was Friday’s allowance of 100, and
Saturday’s solatium of another 100. .
In all, there was a credit balance of 300 lashes,
or 2/00 cuts, iu his favour. The System, having
sanctified the day by a reading by Missionary
M inton of the official prayers (those noble Quakers,
James Backhouse and George Washington
Walker, had not yet visited the settlement, and
the Regime had not been yet convinced there was
any particular necessity for a stronger staff of
c erics) and having honoured it by the reading of
Regulations, proceeded to pay its debts to Convict
Jerricks among others.
Convict Jerricks, when he landed, was a tall,
well-formed, upstanding fellow. Convict Jerricks,
when the Regime, six days later, intimated it was
ready to pay him what it owed him, was a
shrunken, mis-shapen thing. His spirit had broken
and with it his frame. His boyish sulkiness, and
his youthful bravado, had given place to the
cowering terror of the man, as the Regime liked
him to be. We cannot truly say the change was
for the better.
Dr. and Commandant Rossell was present to sec
that Convict Jerricks was duly paid.
# # *
On the Sunday afternoon, No. 2594 was
“ temporarily in hospital.” On Monday, March
26,, at 5.30 a.ln., as the muster of the Quarry-
gang was being made, the Overseer was informed
that Convict Jerricks was still “ temporarily in
hospital.” “Temporarily?” he asked. “Tem-
porarily only,” said the Mustering-Warder. And,
thereupon, was Convict derricks assigned his
normal task of 125 cubic feet of hewage.
On Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday mornings, the same little farce was gone
through. No. 2594 remained “ temporarily iu
hospital,” and each day he was allotted his daily
task.
On Sunday morning, as the Commandant took
his customary stroll through the long, low, dark
room which formed the hospital ward, his atten-
tion was directed to No. 2594’s bed.
“ Who this—2s94 ? Who’s he ?”
“Jerricks, sir. In, after punishment,” the
attendant-surgeon made reply. .
“ Oh, I recollect! We had to break him in.
And he passed on.
He bad got to the next bed, when the hospital
doctor spoke again. . . .
“ Number tweuty-five-uinety-four, sir, is in tem-
porarily only. Better be transferred, sir—lie’s
dying. Case of utter collapse.”
“ Certainly, in that case ! ” was the humane
order. “ Transfer him.”
On next Monday morning, at 5.30, Convict
Benjamin Jerricks, No. 2954, was marked off the
“Quarry Muster Book.” “Transferred to
Hospital.” No task was allotted to him that
day.
As the quarry-gang shuffled to their work, they
had to mss the pier-head. As they did so, a
boat shot out from the landing-steps at the end.
An unshrouded coffin extended its uncanny length
[ore and aft.
“ Know whose cheated the Croaker * ?” queried
No. 17,824 fronl his mate, No, 326.
“Did hear —Jerricks.”
“ Oh, the young’un.”
And otherwise unheeded the boat sped on its
voyage to Dead Man’s Isle. A shark followed in
its wake. . ■
At eleven o’clock on the Sunday night the hos-
pital wardsman had taken down No, 2594’s bed-
card, and had obtained the Surgeon’s signature to
11 requisition for “one coffin, pine, No. 2594 on
lid.”
* * *
There were some conundrums propounded
oy the System and the Regime to which no solu-
tion could ever be obtained. One of them was—
“ Supposing Convict Jerricks, instead of taking
what must have been a pleasure trip to Dead
Island, had resumed quarry-duty, would the
Administration have subjected him to the penal-
ties which were incurred by his neglect to perform
the task-work allotted to him whilst in hospital?”
It is conjectured that the men who demanded
an impossible amount of work from a transport,
and who punished him for not performing the im-
possibility by doubling the already impossible
task, would, probably, have had no compunctions
as to holding No. 2694’s back responsible for
No. 2594’s laches. But as there is no evidence on the
point we will give the Regime the benefit of. the
doubt.
# * *
It was 011 Monday, April 2, that No.
2594’s corpse was interred on “Dead Man’s.”
By one of those coincidences, which, as mani-
fested in the spotless career of Dr. Primrose,
Oliver Goldsmith took so much trouble to explain,
but which are, obviously enough, nothing more
than the ironic pleasantries of the Occult Powers
as they jest with men’s lives, there arrived at Port
Arthur by the schooner on Tuesday, Aprils, Con-
vict Jerrick’s mother.
# # #
Her and his story—is soon told.
A naive, pretty country girl of 20, she was trans-
ported in 1808 for robbery in a dwelling house. A
bit of her mistress’ cast-off finery inflamed her
vanity and her cupidity, and—within a month
she had gone through the gruesome sequence of
gaol, assize-court, the condemned cell, and the re-
ceiving-hulk on commutation of sentence. Prom
the receiving-hulk she was removed to the JEolus,
convict ship, Adio master, Dr. Jonathan Rossell
medical superintendent. On the voyage, the
young surgeon’s deference for the Seventh Com-
mandment and all its implications became some-
what weakened; the houris in the hold were
many; their charms were as various as numerous;
what wonder the youthful and susceptible
“ Croaker” tripped ?
The long voyage over, Katty Higgins, with some
other prisoners as frail, was removed to the
maternity ward of Parramatta Factory, from
whence, in due course, she was wedded
to a young man, Benjamin Jerricks, who
had just been granted (on his freedom) a two-
hundred acre block on the Hawkesbury. Leaving
the pledge of the young surgeon’s affection behind
her, Katty went forth to conquer fortune, and
ONE BETTER.
SHEARER (doing a blow): “I had a dorg once that would work anything : why, he’d
drive a chicken into a jam-pot.”
ROUSEABOUT (a butcher's son) : “That ain’t anything, that ain’t; my father had a doig
that would work blowflies round a winder-pane.”
Benjamin aided her efforts by dying within a
couple of years of his marriage.
The block multiplied into two, three, four.
Katty was on good terms, very good terms, with
prominent Government officials. She was their
agent in surreptitious “ rum ” transactions, and
made money. She was offered marriage by some
of the highest in the land, but, bless you, she was
now “an honest woman,” and “didn’t want no
more truck with husbands.” The boy was
released from the Infant Asylum, new-named,
the dead Benjamin officiating as sponsor, and
sent “ home” to be educated. A private school, a
public school, a university career, a few months
about town-and Benjamin, junior, thought he’d
anticipate a maternal remittance by imitating the
signature of his mother’s agent. The agent repu-
diated the signature before knowing w .0 was
responsible for it, and Benjamin Jerricks, after the
customary routine, merged into “ No. 2594.” -
Her son on the highway, as she thought, to
“becoming a gentleman,” Mrs. Jerricks, the
wealthy widow, devoted her charms and her
energies to becoming wealthier. A magnate of
Sydney, she was ambitious to become the same in
Hobart Town. Making frequent trips in one or
other of her own vessels, to the “old town,” she
yet chiefly resided by the Derwent. Another
object was that she had the let us call
it the ambition, to marry Dr. Jonathan
Rossell, who had become a leading man of
the Regime. She did not love him ; there was
no old-time romance to inspire her scheme : but
she had some vague notion that her mai’riage with
him would console her son when he came out from

home, “ a finished gentleman,” and demanded of
her the history of his paternity. It was the one
dream of her life to be able to meet that demand
by a presentation of her husband, Dr. Rossell:
“ Here, son, is your father ! ” Poor fool! Rossell
had left a young wife in England, who obstinately
refused to die. He would borrow Mrs. derricks’
money, but marry her —he could not. So she led
him a pretty dance. But she had never told him
that his and her son was living ; and as for him,
you could not expect a man to be solicitous as to
the result of one of many liaisons.
* * *
On the Tuesday, then, Widow derricks
presented herself at the Commandant’s Cottage
and demanded her son.
“ I want my son, Rossell. He came down with
the last schooner lot,” she said.
“ Your son ! ” he gasped, “ what about your
son. Didn’t know you had a son ! ”
“ Nor care, I suppose,” she went on. “ But I
want him, and will have him, or else I’ll ruin you
tc-morrow. Give him to me, cook yonr registers
as you have cooked them before, with less reason
—what’s one pris’ner more or less ? ”
“ I don’t know what you’re talking about!
What do you mean ? ”
Dr. and Commandant Rossell, being one of the
best type of officials of the Old Regime, seldom
troubled himself as to whether he was telling the
truth or not. But on this occasion, he certainly
spoke the truth. Convict derricks was simply a
convict to him. He had never connected No.
2594—n0t even when the transport, had declared
he was born in Sydney—with the wealthy Mrs.
derricks. And, even now, when the woman
claimed her son, he did not think of the young
man. How could a high official with a thousand
or two wretches on his hands, remember all their
names ? Why, “ derricks ” might be an alias.
She told him, then, that the Marquess Wel-
lesley had brought out her son. She was at
Richmond when the ship arrived in the Derwent,
and though her agent had written her full par-
ticulars of the young man’s trial and conviction
by the same vessel, she did not get the letter till
ten days after he had arrived at Port Arthur.
The convict had known next to nothing of his
mother's station—only that she was “a rich lady”
in Sydney, and he had resolved, for her sake, to
keep his knowledge of her address to himself.
Not till she had ended her narrative, and im-
plored Rossell to give up her boy, did the Com-
mandant recollect the young convict whom he had
seen, a couple of days previous, dying in hospital.
Of course, he had not been informed of the death.
That was a mere nothing that need not be re-
reported till the usual weekly hospital “ state and
report” was laid before him on the following
Saturday.
When he recalled the dying man’s name, he
could no longer plead ignorance of his identity.
“ He’s in hospital,” he said, “ suffering—oh,
from fever ! I’ll give you an order to see him and
send a man with you—l’d go with you myself, but
I’ll have to see about squaring up the books.
I s’pose I’ll have to let you have him, but, of
course, you’ll keep him out of sight in Hobart
Town, and get him away to Sydney as soon as
possible. ”
Then he penned this :
H.M. Penal Establishment.

(Sd.) Jonathan Rossku,,
Commandant.
At the hospital, she presented the order.
The prisoner-wardsinan looked at it—and at
her, curiously.
“derricks, ma’am? Know his number ?”
“ His ship’s number was 76. I don’t know hia
colonial number.”
He turned to a book, and said “ No. 2594. Ah!
He went to the Island yesterday.”
The widow had never been at Port Arthur
before. She did not know what the Island was,
and said so.
“The Island, ma’am, is the place where they
get better.”
“Then” —the mother’s heart leapt up within
the vulgarly-decked bodice —“he’sgetting better?”
“Yes, ma’am, he is quite convalescent. Better
take the order, ma’am, to the pier—(he pencilled
“2594 ” on the note) —and you’ll find a boat there.
They’ll row you across if you show ’em the order.”
# # #
Unsuspecting the grim fact which lay
beneath the man’s words, and not perceiving the
irony in his phrase, the woman went forth to the
pier. She told the coxswain of the boat that she
wanted to go to the Island, and showed him the
Commandant’s order. Ho could not read, but
took the truth of her statement for granted, and,
for answer, motioned her to a seat, he and his
crew wondering what was the errand of their pas-
senger.
She was still unsuspicious when the boat ran up
to the beach. “Shall we wait, mem?” the cox-
swain asked, and in response she threw him a gold
coin. Gold coins were current even at the Settle-
ment.
She mounted the pine-bordered path, and then,
for the first time, she feared. She saw a monu-
ment, two or three tombstones, some scores of
nameless but numbered sticks protruding from
the ends of mounds ! Why, ’twas a graveyard,
surely ? She derided herself, however, for her
fears. He was not dead—the System had some
curious vagaries—why should it not place a con-
valescent ward in the proximity of a beautifully-
situated cemetery ? The neighbourhood might
conduce to a speedier recovery. So the mother,
and not the woman, reasoned.
# * *
The grave-diggers—she took them for the
warders guarding the convalescents —looked at
the order—and at one another.
The elder moved forward, it might be ten paces
or so.
“ This way, mem,” he said. But he did not look
at her.
He stopped- at a half-filled and unmarked grave.
“This is No. 2594, mem ; buried yesterday.”
“ Dead ! ” she shrieked. They heard her down
at the boat.
“They’re mostly dead when we buries ’em,” the
convict-sexton answered sententiously.
# * *
It might have been ten minutes, it might
have been ten hours, before she came to herself
again. She was only brought back to conscious-
ness when a sexton threw his next day’s ration of
water in her face.
“The order says, mem, that yer to see him.
D’yer wan’ to ?”
“ Yes,” she said, with a sudden decision.
She saw him, as he lay in his shell, ghastly,
shirtless and shroudless, and with the ends of
great wheals (which ran over his shoulders)
exscoriating his chest. She lifted him up to kiss
him—and her hands felt the ridges of raised flesh
on his back.
“Be you his mother, mem?” It was the elder
sexton who spoke-
“ Yes,” she moaned.
“Wud yer like a death-mask, a clay pioter?
I ’udn’t do it ’cept for a mother. Anybody else
’ud split.”
“Yes, yes ; can you make one? Here’s money,”
she said, “ here’s money ! ” She freed one hand
to release her purse.
The man put it aside. “’Cos yer a mother,
an’ not fer money,” he said.
* * *
He sent his mate to the tiny cove to tell
the coxswain to come back for “the lady ” in a
couple of hours, and to bring a bucket of water
back. And while his fellow went on his message,
he himself dug some clay from a newly-sunk and
unoccupied grave.
“ I’ve done this afore,” he said, “for a mother. ’
He went into his hut, and when he returned, he
held in his hands a long piece of tin and a small
bottle of oil.
He was bending the former into an oval to
enclose the face, when the woman stayed his
hands.
“ Not his face,” she muttered, “ but his back.”
“ 1 don’ know as I can. I ain’t enough tin to
make a border.”
“ His shoulders ’ll do, his shoulders—there’s
enough for that.”
There was. And, while the younger man
puddled the clay, the elder fitted the tin frame to
the dead convict’s shoulders, and anointed them
with the oil, so that the clay should not adhere to
them. , ~
In an hour, exposed to the sun, the puddled
clay which had been poured into the frame, dried,
and the men lifted the cast carefully.
“ Give it to me!” said the woman. And she
took it tenderly, as though she were handling
a new-born babe.
“Oil it again, mem, an’ fill it with plaster of
Paris, an’ yer’ll ’av a death-mask complete in the
plaster,” said the elder man, as she left him, to
retrace her steps to the cove.
“ It’ll do as it is ! ” she answered.
# * *
Wrapped in the covering of her shawl,
she carried the thing to the Commandant’s cottage,
in both hands.
Dr. and Commandant Rossell received her.
“I have fixed up his release,” he said, “but
keep him quiet.”
“ Yes,” she responded calmly, “he’ll be quiet
enough now he’s released.”
She unfolded her shawl.
' 1 ‘ Do you know what this is, Doctor ? ”
“Clay?”
“ Yes, clay, and something else. It is the
' death-mask of Benjamin derricks, ray son.”
5 “A death-mask !” The honoured officer of the
Regime was really horrified. “ Is —he dead? ’
“Yes, my son is dead. This is his death-mask,
taken from his dead shoulders. Can’t you guess
why I’ve brought this to show you ?”
“N—o!”
“ Because he was your son as well as mine!”

It will take all Lady Jersey’s tact to
arrange this matter of Lady . In London
distinguished men of all sorts were received in
her drawing-rooms, but they did not insist on
bringing their wives. How Her Ex. ought to act
in this “difficult case” is the most discussed
question in Sydney society. In England Lady
•Jersey could please herself; at Government
House, Sydney, she represents Queen Victoria,
whose Court, so Tennyson sings, “was pure.”
However, Tennyson is a poet, and must be allowed
a big margin.

The authorities of the P. and O.’s steamer
Valeria report that on last voyage there was no
amusement-committee formed on board the ship,
and that what fun took place was purely spon-
taneous. “This on a modern mail steamer is
rather a novelty ; tourists usually lay themselves
out for a complete breakaway from the strained
restraint of society forms,” remarks the shipping
report. The reason is subjoined :
At Brindisi on January 4 a large addition was made to
the number of passengers, among whom were included
Lord Wenlock (.the new Governor of Madras), Lady
Wenlock, Hon. Captain Lawley and Hon. Captain
Baring (aides-de-camp), and Lord Douglas Compton. The
new commander-in-chief of the China Station, Admiral
Sir F. Richards, also joined at Brindisi, the members of
his staff having come round from London in the ship.
Colonel Sir Fleetwood Edwards, assistant-secretary and
groom-in-waiting to Her Majesty the Queen, with Lady
Edwards, also embarked at Brindisi, on their way to
make a tour through India during the cool season.
You mustn’t kick up your heels in the presence
of a Governor of Madras, a groom-in-waiting to
her Majesty the Queen, and other such oppressive
personages, who have never in all their lives lived
in a free country like Australia. From travelling
with a cargo of the Anglo-Indian aristocracy,
good Lord deliver us, poor Australian nobodies !

A London paper informs us that “Captain
de Molyneux, late A.D.C. to Lord Hopetoun, has
to rejoin his regiment,” which reminds us that the
wegiment, you know, is a wemarkably useful
thing for fellah to fall back on, bai Jove! when
fellah gets in doose of mess. Captain Willoughby
come< out as “suite” to Lady Hopetoun, when
that firry young woman accompanies Lady Kin-
tore back co their bony—no, bonnie —earls in
April. One feels anxious to know which of the
Willoughby families this new Captain belongs to.
There are the something-or-other Willoughbys of
Somewhere, and the very ancient tribe of .Wil-
loughbys de Broke. No doubt this is one of the
de Brokes. Beerthh st was a broker, by the way.

A Northern paper says that The Bulle-
tin’s “ virulent and ungentlemanly attacks ” on
Gov. Carington in rc the Mount Rennie case
“ were never taken notice of by that nobleman.”
The fact that The Bulletin was the fly in Gov.
Carington’s ointment is amply evidenced by the
fact that the departed nobleman has devoted page
after page in his confidential despatches to the
Secretary of State for the Colonies to specifically
replying to The Bulletin’s indictment. The
despatches in question will, it is hoped, shortly see
light in the Commons.

The Bulletin thinks the proposal to
erect statues to defunct politicians in a populous
business thoroughfare a blunder. If Wentworth
and Martin have earned statues let them be
erected in suitable places : Wentworth’s, say, in
front of Sydney University ; Martin’s, in proxi-
mity to the new Law Courts. It may be interest-
ing to know when the statue craze will end, and
“who pays the piper?” In front of the new
Sydney Lands Office niches are left for 12 statues,
presumably 12 apostles of the province, beginning
with those of Sir Joseph Banks and Dr. Ludwig
Leichhardt. The artists are now at work on
statues of Burke and Wills, but we would like to
know which niche is destined for the “Judas
Iscariot of N.S.W. political life ?”

Whether a lady may visit an artist in his
studio alone has now been settled in the affirma-
tive by the Princess Louise. She went unattended
to the studio of the late Sir Edward Boehm, and
while there, strangely enough, the sculptor died.
Why should there have been any mystery about
the visit of the Princess Louise ? asks Reynolds.
A number of accounts, all varying, have appeared
with reference to the matter, but there seems to
have been no doubt that the Princess was with
Sir Edward Boehm when he died. There was no
inquest!

The late 11. C. Dean Fitzpatrick, of Mel-

known parishioner, a fairly wealthy man, waiting
upon him to procure a special marriage-license.

“your wife is only a month dead!” “But,
Dean, isn’t she as dead as ever she’ll be, and. then,
there’s the childer want looking after ! ”

Never put money into your mouth. A
well-dressed girl sat in a crowded Newtown (Syd-
ney) ’bus, next to a malodorous Chinaman. The
conductor asked for fares. The Chinee placidly
pulled a “thrippenny ” out of his right ear. The
maiden drew a sixpence from between her teeth.
The conductor mechanically handed her back as
change the Chinkey’s threepenny-piece. The
sweet and innocent girl, from sheer force of habit,
placed it between her pearly teeth, until such
time as she could adjust her glove and dive for her
purse.

In Melbourne they are raking up all

“Andrew Menzies” complains in th e
daily press that 250 men have been employed for
the whole of two Sundays on certain Sydney rail-

Works of necessity, no doubt. Mr. Menzies adds;
PLAYING WITH FIRE.
LORD OF THE MANOR: “See here, my friend, [?] set fire to that; the grass is very
dry and you might burn up the whole place ! ”
AMATEUR FIRE-FIEND: “What are you talking about? I’m lighting it with safety
matches!”

was killed last Sunday.” The lightning of an
offended God, no doubt! What are the odds

This story is most probably a lie, but that
doesn’t matter much. Most amusing things in
this world are lies—it is only plain and solemn
statements such as sermons and gas-bills and
corns and lost dogs that are absolutely reliable.
A female physician has started business some-
where, but her door-plate doesn’t go into details
about her sex, and thus the casual visitor is apt
to be taken in. In fact, he is taken in frequently.
The last caller at the house was an itinerant mer-
chant. and when a tall, gaunt female in goggles
opened the door, he stated that he had called
round to offer the highest current price for the
doctor’s left-off trousers, and would also take his
old shirt at market rates. And though it is over a
week since that visit, he doesn’t know yet why
the lady drove the door up against his head, and
left him lying at the foot of the steps, a dis-
hevelled heap of unhinged intelligence and bashed
hat and broken merchandise.

On “Edinburgh’s” second visit to Aus-

in revenge, forming an alliance with the Duke’s
Equerry, Elliot Y orke. It was the common talk
of the day that Madame Celeste, the actress, who
visited Melbourne at the same time as the Duke,
had under, her elderly wing a jealously-guarded
“fairy ” who was an especial favourite of H.R.H.
The Duke was a constant visitor at the villa on
Carlton Gardens where Celeste lived, and he
made a special trip to Hobson’s Bay to see her off
for “ home ” by the mail-steamer a few days before
he left Australia.

The excuse of the engraver who, to the

When Governor Hopetoun paid his first
visit to Bendigo, one loyal ass hung up, as his
share of the decorations, a card bearing the word
“ Welcome,” and a wreath which was constructed
by tying roses on to a rope. But unluckily the
roses blew away, and when the Governor appeared
the first thing that met his eye was a hangman’s
noose and a gladsome inscription which seemed to
invite him to put his head inside and be choked.

A local fashion writer makes one or two
suggestions “ to obviate spoiling a nice skirt by
crushing past other folk to reach one’s seat ” at
the theatre. The one obvious remedy is to take
the skirt off, and crowd past in a corset and a
petticoat, and then put the outer garment on
again when the seat is reached, but the writer
never even thought of this. There is a dreadful
lack of inventive power about the average female.

One of these things which man would like
to know, but which woman won’t explain, is how
she fastens on her hat. First of all she sticks the
article on her head, where the great mass of hair
is that she bought at the shop where they were
selling things below cost on account of the estab-
lishment having been struck by lightning,
filling the remaining vacancies up with
the bag her hat came home in. Then
she tilts it fiNward and drives it down over her
eyes, where it hangs on about as securely as a
man standing on the side of a wall. Next she
gets out a pin, one foot long, and drives it right
through the hat and through her head, and brings
it out the other side as if she rather enjoyed it
than otherwise. Then she smiles and goes away.

The statement which lately went the
round of the press that “the Princesses Maud
and Victoria of Wales have stamped their little
feet and made the startling announcement that
they intend never to marry ” is now in process of
correction. The real fact is that the two ladies in
question made a horrid crash with their extremi-
ties, for they each take No. 7 boots, and when
either of them puts her foot down it sounds like
a quartz-crushing plant which is doing its best to
produce a big dividend. This is not uttered,
however, in any disrespectful sense, for The Bul-
letin has a sincere respect for the maiden with
copious feet, and it recognises the fact that the
girl who is plentiful about the trotters and abund-
ant in the matter of boots does far more to
gladden a fellow’s heart in the thorny ways of
life than the female whose fairy footfall is as soft
as the tread of a kitten walking upon air. There
is comfort, too, in her large, ponderous hand, and
when trouble is all around and the atmosphere is
full of gloom her proprietor can trust her with his
sorrows, for there are brains and sympathy in her
wild, red head, despite the fact that her hair won’t
he down unless an iron stove or a fender is hung
on the end of every separate bristle. But the
truth is mighty and must prevail, for we have
seen the two ladies lots of times
and they have not got small feet, whatever may be
said to the contrary. If the British fashion-papers
state that the Princesses deposited their pedal
extremities resolutely upon the earth’s crust The
Bulletin is willing to accept the assertion —
otherwise wo must pass for a euchre.

“Professor Moestig, of Vienna, alleges
that he has discovered a certain cure for cancer,
but no details of the remedy have as yet been
made public.”— [Cable.)
The first sermon preached in the new
Anglican cathedral at Melbourne was delivered
by a Catholic, and once more the Terewth has got
left. One day when the building was near com-
pletion a holy father dropped in promiscuous like,
and addressed a short but impassioned discourse
to an audience of a dozen carpenters, several
polishers, a man with a pot of varnish, and an
artist in paving-stones. Then he walked away
with a look of unutterable contentment on his big
shorn countenance, for he had got ahead of the
beastly heretic, and bowled the schismatic out.

Our lip we can’t help curlin’

Sure, there’s Doctor Quack, of Berlin,
Always finding something fresh
To prevent mankind from croaking,
And to load himself with fame.
This is not a theme for joking,
But —we get there just the same.
Sure, the world is full of asses
Who will swallow any stuff
From a long-haired crank in glasses,
If he “ puts on jam ” enough.
And the Liar of the Cable
Lends assistance in the game,
But despite each learned fable
We must get there just the same.
Why, a Frenchman brewed elixir
For renewing youth in age

As the scientific sage).
But the stuff lie drew from rabbits
For that fizzle was to blame—
O ! it didn’t change his habits,
And he’ll get there just the same.
Here’s a man has struck a plan, sirs—
So the daily papers say—
To prevent the growth of cancers, -
And we only hope he may ;
All the things they’ll soon be healing
To which one can put a name—
Yet we’re haunted by a feeling
That we’ll get them just the same.
O confound all foreign “ masters ”
With a secret to disclose !
We believe in mustard-plasters,
And put tallow on our nose.
Let the savants of Vienna
Spin their narrative s so lame—
If we stick to salts and senna
We can get there just the same.

A remarkable instance of reformation on
the part of a character from whose antecedents,
and considering the company he kept, little go. cl
could have been expected, has been reported
recently from Maoriland. The individual referred
to, notwithstanding his previous career of noto-
riety, is now a respected employe of the Mosgiel
woollen factory, drawing his wages regularly
every Saturday, and living contentedly on his
humble, but honestly-eome-by screw, very much
to the surprise of some of his former associates,
who still carry on in their old way. To show the
great change that has come over the man who is
now earning his bread as a factory-hand, it is
only necessary to explain that lie was for several
years previously well-known to the police and
others as a member of Parliament.

A diminutive female enjoyed the pleasure
of sitting in a Melbourne Court last week, whilst
a witness stated that her (the d.f.’s) father told
him “ he had a dwarf daughter, and wanted to
get a husband for her.” The witness supplied
this long-felt want right off. Meeting a six-foot
young man of his acquaintance, he said, “Jones,
I’ve got a good thing on for you. A wife and
plenty of money.” Whereupon Jones jumped at
the good tiling, and because he carried out his
promise of “getting every note the old man
had,” somebody is worrying the happy pair with
a caveat. The course of true love never runs

Two dozen English baronets, more than
three dozen knights, with scarcer kinds of noble-

ending December 31, since when the best blue
blood of the realm ha< been drying up like creeks

this generation ” (wrote a gushing flunkey in the
World) “have so many parsons of note passed
away in the course of a twelvemonth.” A list of
the parsons scarcely disclosed a single name of
any note outside the columns of society papers.
Simply so many holders of titles had passed the
things on to their next descendants, or carted
them away to the cold grave.

“Inexpressibly sad” is the comment of
one of our religious papers on Bradlaugh’s abso-
lutely silent burial. This phrase seems to come
from the heart of the writer, and not to be the
mere commonplace of a paid reverend literary
mullah. The force of custom will also make
many laymen think it sad—for there are few of
us who could bury our kinsman or our mate with-
out a shred of ceremony. Nevertheless, many
thousands think a silent burial in the case of a
strong man like the great iconoclast magnificently
dignified, a solemn reverence for the majesty of
Death, infinitely more religious than the frigid
mummery of words repeated by the eight-aiid-
sixpenny cemetery-chaplain in a hurry to get
away to his tea. Yet one likes the French system
of an oration at the grave.

Dear Bulletin, —Fifteen years ago Mr.
Blank having tried many occupations and failed
in all repaired to (here may be inserted the name
of almost any moderately-sized town in Victoria)
and opened a boarding-school. As educational
establishments w re then scanty he soon got a fair
number of pupils and established a pretty large
connection. He is a harmless old noodle as fitted
to form a boy’s character as to-—translate Latin at
sight. But you must not imagine that Mr.
Blank’s seminary has not got a scholastic reputa-
tion. If I had his prospectus at hand I could tell
you how many of his boys have passed the matri-
culation examination. For this exam, is taken
as the criterion of the work of our pro-
fessional “ crammer.” Of his 30 boarders
ten are being prepared for matriculation ;
these ten are forced to work day and night
wrecking whatever brain-power they may have—
f >r Mr. Blank prides himself on the celerity with
which he “crams” his pupils. The remainder
are left to the tender mercies and meagre scholar-
ship of some junior master, who, having just
passed through the cramming ordeal, and being
without an idea of his own, and utterly inex-
perienced in teaching, is, according to Mr. Blank’s
idea, well fitted for the position lie holds. But
the ten candidates for matriculation are the main-
stay of the school —they are the prize-boys of the
establishment. On the annual speech-day their
wondrous deeds of scholarship will be recounted.
The local rag will compliment the town on pos-
sessing so ripe a scholar and so successful a
teacher as Mr. Blank. The fame of the estab-
ment increases - fresh pupils are enrolled, all
striving to matriculate. Poor but foolish parents
deny themselves of necessaries almost, in order
to send their sons to Mr. Blank’s seminary and
make “gentlemen” of them. Fanners’sons arc
transformed into needy clerks and embryo em-
bezzlers, ready to go clown on their knees and
kiss the feet of anyone who will give them a
pound a week. The army of bank-clerks and
other supercilious gentlemen is increased, the
unemployed become more numerous—and Mr.
Blank makes a fortune.—Yours, Nickleby.

A persecuted Mount Gambler (LA.) law-
yer has just migrated to Adelaide. A Mount
Gam bier girl bore a child and elected Bluebag as
its father. Bluebag denied the allegation, and
defied the allegatoress. The girl-mother had no
corroborative testimony, and the case was dis-
missed. But public opinion somehow* went mad
over the verdict. There was held, on the Satur-
day night following, in Mount Gambier, a
“ Working Men’s Carnival.” First came a borno-
aloft effigy of Bluebag with a baby in his arms ;
next, a brass band ; and last, a procession of 4CCO
howling, hooting, horse-playing sons of Belial.
At an improvised gallows the effigy was hanged,
danced round, and yelled at, and finally burnt.
Then a big subscription was taken up for the girl.

young squire, is Anderson’s daughter. He was a

actor iu Sir William Don’s company ; he was very
chummy with that Bart, and a good deal like

A “Guelph Exhibition,” consisting of
“pictures and objects of interest connected with
the Royal Family,” is to be held shortly in Eng-
land. Queen Charlotte will be shown a shade less
short and snuffy than she was in real life, and the
forehead and chin of George 111. will slope back not
nuite so obliqu-ly as they did when he was alive.
No mention will be made, either, of the harem of
giantesses maintained by George L, whose mis-
tresses were all ladies of immense size and as ugly
as the menagerie of gorgons that howl round the
public-houses of Hades; and any little sketch of
the same monarch’s legitimate wife, during her 20
years’ imprisonment in Zell, will be judiciously
omitted. Also, George IV.’s partner in life will
not be delineated in the act of being thrown out
by her husband’s flunkeys on the eve of his corona-
tion—in fact, the exhibition will consist of the
tilings that are not there, rather than of those
that are, otherwise British loyalty will receive a
lot of damage. P.S. —We hope that this will not
lead to our being struck off the roll of J.P.’s.

Dear Bulletin, —I see you have a refer-
ence to the D. H. Deniehy memorial-stone. It
may interest you and others to learn that despite
all the blather and slobber we have had over this
matter, the monumental masons who contracted
to erect the stone have never been paid a penny
for it and have consequently become involved in
difficulties. Neither lias their assignee ever suc-
ceeded in getting a penny out of the guaran-
tors, and consequently the unfortunate wage-
earners have never been paid for working the
stone, &c. The amount of the contract was £4OO.

querist that “it is not true that the P.M. is an
habitual drunkard.” We’re sorry to hear it, and
deeply sympathise with the local boozers.

Mrs. Kenealy, lady doctor (no relation,
apparently, to the Wagga fat man’s legal
friend), writes a striking paper, in last National
Review, on "Woman’s Physique.” Logically
carrying out Darwinism, she irrefragably proves
that the high intellectual culture of women
deteriorates their offspring, giving actual examples
from her practice. Energy bestowed on one part
of the frame is taken from another; brains v. the
pelvicular, nothing more natural, as we see in the
vice versa action of the English “ aristocracy,” and
the weedy way in which they are training down.

C. C. Kingston, Q.C., the Adelaide
lawyer, occupied over 11 hours addressing the
Court for the defence in Morrison’s “ Aldine
History ” case. About £20,000 was indirectly in-
volved in the verdict, and the case is stated to
have been the longest on record. Kingston was
retained by a syndicate of subscribers who refused
to receive the book..

An Adelaide man started as a parson,
and for a time the business panned out well.
Then he took to temperance-lecturing, but
changed that for brokering on the Adelaide
Corner and made £50,000 during the boom. He
put half this into a suburban brewery and
“ specked ”on the Corner with the rest. Finally
he dropped the whole lot, and is now meditating
over his misfortunes at a salary of 30s. a week.

Has anyone seen an Archdook
Secreted in corner or nook ?
His name in Australia’s
Doubtless an alias—
Possibly Simpson, or Snook.
By his royal expression alone
Uau such a young person be known,
If, like Nanki Poo,
He adopts when on view
The disguise of a “ second-trombone.”
If anyone drops on his nibs,
The hero of scandalous squibs,
With freedom and jollity
(Don’t mind his quality)
Give him a dig in the ribs,
And say, with a nod and a look,
“ You’ve got to go back, my archdook ”;
Then cable bis Puppx
“ lie’s coming— for supper
The calf that is fatted, please cook.”
The Case of Mrs. Moeller.
GREAT EXCITEMENT IN SYDNEY.
In these days of talking dolls, telegraphs, ocean
cables, telephones, microphones and other electric
inventions, when the occurrences in one part of
the world are telegraphed to the farthest point
thei’efrom in one day, and when a traveller makes
a journey right round the globe in 03 days, it
takes something out of the common to startle a
community, but the late experiences of Mrs.
Laure Mueller are enough to startle the dead.
Mrs. Mteller, who resides at Newtown N.S.W., is
a native of Germany and came to this country
some years ago. She had suffered from Liver and
Kidney complaints for years, and about three
mouths previous to the present time was com-
pletely prostrated and unable to work ; dropsy of
the ankles and lower limbs having set in. We
diagnosed the case ourselves and can truthfully
assert that it was a cas ■ of advanced dropsy due
to relaxation and enfeebleraent of the membranes
of the Liver and Kidneys, which permitted the
waste fluids to exude through them into the
muscular tissue. We advised the use of Clements
Tonic and it was taken for some weeks and has
resulted in a complete cure. Mrs. Moeller herself
thus describes her ease :—“ Stanley Laundry,
Georgina-stieet, Newtown, N.S.W. I can with
confidence bear witness to the wonderful efficacy
of Clements Tonic in curing Liver and Kidney
disease. I have long been a victim to indigestion
(caused by liver complaint) and an affection of the
kidneys. I suffered terribly from heidaches,
pains in the back and side, with obstinate o:n-
-stipation. No one except myself knows what my
sufferings have been. I was always tired and
languid, with no ability or inclination to perform
my daily work. My tongue was furred in a
morning, and a sour taste in the mouth, and fre-
quent vomiting ; one day I would be pretty well
and the next very distressed or completely pro-
strated with a very confirmed languor. This went
on until I was so ill I was completely done up
and quite unable to move. My ankles being
swollen as thick as my thighs, I consulted
physicians all of whom pronounced the case one
of Dropsy, they variously ascribed the cause to be
heart, liver, or Bright’s disease.- The kidneys
were undoubtedly diseased, because' the swollen
ankles when pressed with the finger would leave
a dent in the place for days, and it was easy to
press the end of the finger an inch deep, when the
hole would not fill up for four days. I had heard
of the wonderful cures effected by Clements Tonic
and commenced its use. I took three bottles and
the swelling in the ankles commenced gradually
to subside, I continued the medicine and am now
completely cured ; my ankles are their usual size,
I have no aches nor pains and can do a good day’s
work with pleasure, my tired aching feelings have
all disappeared, and I am confident I have been
rescued from an untimely grave by the wonderful
virtues Clements Tonic. My address is at the
head of this letter, and I will reply to any com-
munications if a stamped envelope is sent with
inquiry, as I consider it my duty to publish a
record of my wonderful cure. Yours very grate-
fully, Laupe Mocller.
Mrs. Moeller’s case is only a prototype of many
others in this country. She obtained a cure by
persistent treatment, and this is the only way
chronic disease can be cured, a half-hearted treat-
ment is never satisfactory, you must continue the
remedy for a considerable time if you want to cure
long standing cases, the tendency after a certain
age is always towards decay, therefore if debility
lias been eating its way into the system for
months or years, it is very unreasonable to except
one or two bottles to restore perfect health, all
bad cases requiring protracted treatment.

Cashmere Bouquet is the most popular
of all American Toilet Soaps.
The materials of which it is made are
selected with the greatest regard for puri-
ty, and for the soothing and beneficial
effect which they impart to the skin and
complexion.
The perfume of Cashmere Bouquet is a
skilful combination of rare and delicate
odors. This perfume is introduced into
the soap by elaborate and powerful ma-
chinery, and each cake is stamped with
such enormous pressure (30 tons) that it
will outlast all others.

“ Unexcelled in Quality and Perfume. ’’
CORRESPONDENCE
“J.A.M.”:Two of your pictorial suggestions
are dear old friends. Now tell us, do you really think
them original? Your story was old
when the earth was hew. We have heard it told of High,
landers, Welshmen, and Germans. It doesn’t fit Paddy
“E.O.”* (Studley Park): M.S. now to hand— “A-
M'Masters ” : (I),The sale of alcoholic liquor is inevitable
in Australia, which has been marked out by Nature as a
greqt wine-growing country. (2) We personally believe
that good wine in moderation is even better than tea in
moderation. (3) We strongly dislike the average “tern,
perance-man,” because he is a well-meaning tyrant who
would impose on you not only his anti-alcoholio fad, but
also his special religious dogma, and would metaphorically
take away not only your ale, but also your cakes, in the
endeavour to make you a “ good ” man (like himself) al 1
round. (4) The best-natured and most intellectual men
we have ever known have taken alcohol, and some of the
worst, because most deliberate, rascals of our experience
have been teetotallers. (5) Tub Bulletin believes in high
license and in imprisonment, without option of fine, for
adulteration “J. O. M. M. ”: Poor crank!
“Australian” (Old Junee): Will print. No enquiry was
made by the W. A. Government, so far as vve have learnt,
as to the alleged ill-treatment of blacks under Col. Angelo.
“F.A.” (Gor.): Your intended anti-climax isn’t an
anti-climax at all, for, you see, the commencing verso
rises not above the merest commonplace “Music”
If you have a really good voice and other qualifications
you should visit Sydney or Melbourne, where you will
find many managers quite ready to give you at least a
private trial “ Subscriber ”; Sandail, of course. Who
that saw the affair could form any other opinion ?
“ Pinched-out ” : Many thanks. “Bluegum”: Quaint
verses, but rather weak motif. Try something else
“Anthony M.” Thanks... “John R.”: Pretty “steep.”
Don’t you think you could put the case in less space?'....
“E. 8.8.” (Leich.); Next week “ Ab. Intra” (Nag.):
Received letter but not MS. up to date.... “Frank O.”:
Amusing, but hardly worth space “ Proletariat ” :
Thanks,...“ E.C.” : We will print your letter....
“W.L.”: As the law now stands, if you in England marry
your deceased wife’s sister, you have no legal rights, but
are not liable to prosecution “George Sayton”: The
Railway Commissioners should give reasons —if they
refuse to do so, and are permitted by Parliament to
refuse, then they will be established as the most powerful
tyrants of a noxious bureaucracy. They are public
servants and the public want to know, and have a right
to know, the rationale of the deeds of its paid servants.
The Supreme Court judges give reasons, and never act
in a purely arbitrary way,...“ Arthur W. Bateman”:
Thanks....“ L.” : The fact that “it is true in every
particular” doesn’t necessarily make it any belter. Lies
are often more cheerful things than truths “H.E.H.”;
(1) You can’t get bound volumes except to order, in
advance. (2) lie was knighted about ten years ago—
when John Davies was made a C.M.G.— and has a Papal
order.... “A. Easton ” : The public worships success, and
doesn’r take advice from people who spend their declining
days in the asylum.... “ Leo. de B.” : Hope to print your
gory story.,.. “E Edwards” (N.Z): Will read carefullv’....
“A. 0.”: Yes, Jersey sa haireditary nobleman... “Nil
Nevernever” :We don’t remember your verses “ A. 0.”
(V.): The Irish party led by Parnell owed its power to its
absolute independence. Should it, led by another man,
• coalesce with the English “ Liberals” it will be impotent.
“ A.W.S.” : An Australian Governor is certainly not
a citizen. He can’t vote, for instance....“ 8.H.8.”
(Wagga): Sweet, and natural verse. Accepted... “Walter
M‘L.”: Unless a policeman holds a warrant he cannot
enter your house on a “ fishing ” expedition. If, however,

“ Scenes that I remember ” : The writer does not give his

Mr. Proudfoot, contractor, sues Mr. Scbey,
M.L.A. (N.S.W.), for £lOOO damages in respect
of a certain libel contained in an article pub-
lished by Sydney Truth and said to have been
written by Schey. As it would be an unpardon-
ably unjournalistic thing for a newspaper-man,
under threat of a libel-action, to disclose the name
of a contributor, people are wondering how
Proudfoot managed to get hold of Sohey’s name.
Minister Drunker (N.S.W.) has approved
of the forfeiture by the Urana Land Board of
a selection taken up by a Miss M‘Connell, on
the ground of alleged dummyism, because her
father had provided her with the funds to pay the
fees. Miss M‘Connell is “ sweet seventeen,” and
her father would be considered by most people to
be her natural backer. Her selection would pro-
bably have been her dot for the man who selected
her. Is the inference to be drawn that, had Miss
M‘Coimell borrowed the money from a strange
man, the Urana Land Board would not have
forfeited the -selection? Or, should she have'
become a usurer’s client ?
The trimmest of trimming newspapers is
the Melbourne Age. One day last month we
were favoured with a leader in support of Parkes’
action in dismissing the Bourke J.P. for reflecting
on the character of the Prince of Wales. Last
week we had an unexceptionable article on Aus-
tralian Nationalism, apropos of the Carington
lecture. Nothing delights the Age more, than to
fire off a leader that would astonish old Dr. Lang,
if he were here, after indulging in weeks of
twaddle about royalty, loyalty and the colonial
possessions of Britain. David Syme is making
ready to get down on the pleasantest (monetary)
side of the political fence.
' Judge Macfarland, (N.S.W.) in sentencing
two garotters the other day, said that “the fact
that the crime was committed in one of the
principal streets of Sydney showed, on the part of
the prisoners a disregard of all law and peaceable-
ness,” &c. &o. And we suppose that Mac. piled
on the agony in accordance with his locality logic.
What, in the name of horsehair and ermine, has
locality to do with the degree of heinon-ness of a
crime of this sort ? Is it to be inferred that, had
the garrotters shadowed their victim to the
sequestered sandhills of Moore Park, and throttled

him in murky solitude, they would, in the Judge’s
opinion, have shown some measure of regard for
“ all law and peaceableness ? ”
A humble, plain, ordinary picnic, that
had no points which could distinguish it from any
other picnic, came off lately in a back-blocks town,
and the local paper published three columns of
burning frenzy about the event. A small sample
follows :
“ The party resolved themselves into family and
friendly groups in picturesque confusion about the
grounds, on the green carpet of which the unfortunate
carriers of the many ‘ apoplectic’ hampers (with undis-
guised gladness) quickly deposited their burdens, under
whose weight they had groaned more severely than they
have hitherto probably done under that incubus on the
human conscience, the vicarious accountability for origi-
nal sin. The explanation may not he difficult of search ;
for whereas the former was an undoubted corporeal tangi-
bility, the latter, to many minds, presents itself as a mere
theological abstraction. But whatever may be the true
philosophy of this hotly-disputed and seemingly insolvable
crux in polemics ; or whatever of real scientific value in
the forcible deductions drawn by Macaulay from the con-
sideration of cognate theses in his masterly essay on
Milton—a literary gem of most exquisite splendour,
which every Briton should highly prize - the fact remains
that limits of space and the occasion alike forbid the
elaboration of such matters in this article.”
And yet all he wants to say is that Smith humped
the grab.
Henniker Heaton lately related to the
Royal Colonial Institute the old, old chestnut
about the semi converted blacks who jibbed on
Christianity and its missionaries with : “You gib
it no more rum ! No more rum, no more bally
hallelujah !” Whereat the podgeys of the insti-
tute guffawed loudly, as if the superior races of
whites never showed the same sort of gratitude
and flunkeyism for favours to come. Think hard
over the subject and you will find that the white
man’s motto, through every grade, is : “ Plenty
pray, if you gib it ’bacca.” The Uriah Heeps of
society and other varieties of artful young men
are not slow at discovering that now-a-days if
they want to acquire and keep a situation it is
advisable for them to join the Y.M.C.A., or the
Evangelistic choir, or some other religious coterie
that works as do all the godly rings, on mutual
scratch-me-back principles. It is the very same
slimy spirit that impels Burglar Bill and the other
cracksmen to join the Salvation Army, as causes
Adolphus de Pitsuout to worship at the tedious
socialities of Government House. A premium
has always to be paid for prospective benefits
either a cash bonus or a servile hypocrisy .that
only lasts till “ you no gib ic ’bacca.”

The Watts River (Vic.) is to have its name
changed to Maroondah on Peb. 18th, when that
charming trout stream will be solemnly dedicated
to the service of the Melbourne Water Supply.
The original Watts has no solid claim to immor-
tality. He neither discovered nor improved the
little shining river. All he did was to fall into it
and get drovyned, long,Tong ago.
When Disraeli first appealed to an English
constituency at Wycombe Tie addressed the free
and independent electors from the doorway of the
local pub., and by his side was . a wooden lion
painted red, with a flaring tail and an eye like the
rising sun. It was a rowdy gathering, and
Disraeli nearly collapsed in, trying to make
himself heard : hut at last, finding it alp to no
purpose, begirded up his loins for one vociferous
whoop, and, grasping the lion by the scalp, he
screamed forth : “Thus, in time to come, will I
also grasp the British lion.” Disraeli is dead now,
and the old lion lies doubled up in a stable on
Baron Carington’s estate ; with his hide washed
off through rain and frost, and his legs broken,
and his tail reduced to a mere skewer.
Advfc. in the Parisian papers :
All persons of the female sex, between the ages of six-
teen and forty, who will bring a long hair from their head
to the Baron Arnold de Fortville (who is well-known) will
receive five francs on condition that the said hair he from
the head of the person who brings it.
This was no take in, for the Baron, a great
original, wished to .form a collection of women’s
hair wherewith to make himself a bed-pillow.
He had already amassed a considerable amount,
when, on account of being greatly ridiculed, he
was obliged to leave Paris. The Baron went from
Paris to London, Rome, St. Petersburg, Vienna,
Madrid, Lisbon, Stockholm, gathering up Italian,
Russian, German, English hair, &e., to keep
company with the French hair. After travelling
some time the Baron returned to Paris with his
precious pillow filled with the spoils of so many
lovely women, and certainly more than 100,000
had contributed to satisfy this strange whim, and
at present the Baron sleeps and dreams every
night with his famous pillow.
The “loyal” editor, who fills his paper
with joyous knowledge about the shirts and hair
and hash of the aristocracy, is a weariness and a
desolation. lie suffers from an incurable con-
vict:on that the solar system revolves around the
pimple on a monarch’s spine, and that the axis of
the earth passes through his big, coarse feet, and
that his sore ear is the principal decoration of
Paradise ; and when some superfluous potentate,
or his son, or his eleven hundredth uncle is
graciously pleased to pick his back tooth with a
carving-knife, he telegraphs the information all
over the earth. Also he cables about the oint-
ment that was put on Brown’s legs, and publishes
an appeal to the nation to bear up and meet mis-
fortune with Christian heroism when Battenberg’s
dog’s brother has a cold ; and if the royal dust-
man loses his deranged aunt he states that an in-
scrutable Providence has been pleased to inflict a
heavy sorrow upon the nation. The following,
from Vanity Pair, is a decent sample of this most
awful sort of slush :
I notice that my contemporaries say nothing of the fact
that Prince George did really dine with the Prince of
Wales on the night of the first levee. Prince George
arrived at Marlborough House from Portsmouth at
7 o’clock on that evening. Yet when Vanity Pair said
beforehand that Prince George would dine with his father
on this occasion Vanity Fair was violently contradicted in
the usual fashion.
And yet there was no "wild crash and row among
the stars, neither did the sun tear its hair, or the
planetary system break its neck as it bolted in
affright, nor did the volcano and the thunderbolt
and the great sea-serpent burst forth. In fact,
nobody cared whether George raged like a de-
vouring pestilence among his father’s hash, or
whether he ate a pie under a tree, or consumed a
carrot on top of the great pyramid, or assimilated
stolen hen down a coal-mine. Nobody cared,
either, if he arrived from Portsmouth at 7 o’clock,
or if he got back from Gehenna in a hansom cab
at a-quarter past two, and had to sit on the door-
step till daybreak, or if he emerged from a hearse
exactly at noon. Neither does it interest anybody
whether Vanity Fair foresaw that he was going
to feed with his ancestor, and even if that paper
had learned in advance that he would wash him-
self before dinner, or that he would lose his shirt-
button down his back, the sun would probably
rise next morning in the same miserable, old, con-
ventional way. The paper that worries over
things like these ought to buy a rattle and some
toffee, and then get washed by its mother and put
to bed.

WHAT EXPERIENCE TEACHES
IS BEST.
There is something to consider in the daily ex
penses for the household necessities, which in th
aggregate of the year amount to a good deal
The ethics of buying and selling appear to be foi
the vendor to get all he can, and the purchaser to
see that he don’t get too much. But what is too
much ? It is almost a profound question, and
presents the strange paradox that the desert in
many things is often the cheapest. Certainly this
is so in food, when health is involved, and in
remedies which restore health after if has been
impaired. It is certainly so in clothing; for a
cheap suit that will hardly last one is dearer than
the one which will last two seasons, the difference
in price being reasonable. So in shoes and the
like. Recurring to the items of food .and health,
undoubtedly the most important, it is found that
villainous adulteration is what renders cheaper
much that is sold, and men are known to
have spent thousands to be cured of disease, have
suffered years of agony, and have trifled away
their substance on worthless remedies. That
which is testified to by thousands as being an
absolute cure, and permanently efficacious, is
cheap at any price in comparison v-ith such as
have no virtue, and which prolong suffering. A
case in point is the following: “New Bloom-
field, Pa., April 20,18SG. The Charles A. Vogeler
Co., Baltimore, Md. Gentlemen, —Eor more
than thirty years I had been afflicted with rheu-
matism so severe Iliad to use morphine to secure
rest at night. Spent hundreds of dollars with
physicians and for remedies without benefit.
Five years ago I tried St. Jacobs Oil, and it
effected an entire and permanent cure. I have
not been troubled with it since. Cold or damp
weather does not affect me at all. I desire to
give it my unqualified endorsement. — J. E. Bon-
sall, clerk of the several Courts of Perry County,
Pa.” The point here is not so much what Mr.
Bonsall paid for the great remedy of pain, for
the price is a mere bagatelle, but that he was
permanently cured after 30 years’ suffering. Of
course the poor must count the cost in everything ;
but they should reckon on the sound basis that
that which is bad is worthless, and that which is
the best and will cure, and stay cured, is cheap at
any price.
SERIOUS FLOOD IN SOUTH AUS-
TRALIA.
DISASTROUS LOSSES.
By recent advices from South Australia we are
informed that, under date of 13th October, Mr.
H. 0. Merrett, of North Creek, Warrina, writes
as follows to Messrs A. W. Dobbie and Co., of
Adelaide, which is sure to prove of interest to a
large number of our readers ; “ Dear Sir, —I am
writing to tell yon about a Water bury Watch that
I had in use for about twelve months. I lost it in
the water on Easter Monday last when there was
a very big flood here, and it was found again on
the 1st of October, and three inches deep in the
ground. When I got it I wound it up and it has
been going ever since, and keening splendid time,
so I thought that I would let you know, as it may
be something in favour of the watches. There are
any amount of people about here that know this
for a fact. If you would like to see the watch let
e know, and I will send it down to you.”
AT A TRIFLING COST
you can obtain a Water bury Watch, which rarely
gets out of order, and never const!tues, itself a
permanent tax on the owner. In the event of
injury befalling it, by taking or sending it to the
Company’s Repair Depot, 56, Margaret-street, it
can be efficiently repaired at a nominal cost,
ranging according to the extent of damage, from
6d to 2s 6d, but never exceeding the latter amount
unless by mutual consent.
The genuine Waterbury may be obtained from
any respectable storekeeper or dealer. Price,
series “E” (the old favourite), 13s. 6d. ; series
“J” or “L” (the new marvels), with enamelled
dials, 22s. 6d. each.

POLITICAL POINTS
Sir Thos. MTlwraith is a maker of epi-
grams. One of his latest is—“ The flourishing
colonial industry of borrowing money.”
;The Prince of Wales’ appeal, to Austra-
lians “ not to forget the land from which they
sprang ” reminds one of how gallantly the Wettin
family stick to their native Yarmany.
The Indian Government has got an idea
that Australia objects to “ Indian natives of bad
character ” coming to Australia. All black
Indians are of bad character, so far as Australia
is concerned.
The new W.A. loan (of which £900,000
only is to be devoted to railway purposes) will
double the indebtedness of that province—
making the public debt £2,700,000, or about £6O
per head of the present population.
Manifest signs of a N. S. W. general elec-
tion are now visible. The Government, not the
Railway Commissioners, has called for tenders for
175,000 tons of steel rails, to be made in N.S.W.
out of N.S.W. minerals and with fuel raised in
N.S.W.
Attorney Levien, M.L.A., says that he
“ would not be seen in a dog-kennel with some of
the men that honest old Parkes has been associated
with.” The Bulletin has yet to meet the man
so dishonest that no lawyer will have him as a
client.
“Parkes, the political Colossus,” says a
N.S.W. Foreign-trade paper. Yes, says The
Bulletin, the Colossus of Rhodes-and Bridges.
The old humbug who has kept office by strang-
ling the Local Government movement for twenty
years.
The cableman says that Dillon and O’Brien,
who have surrendered to undergo their six months’
gaol, will be released long ere the full time has
expired. Likely enough, as Salisbury will use
every possible means to cripple Parnell and divide
the Irish.
The Irish Parliamentary party having en-
couraged Parnell to defy Nonconformist cant after
the divorce exposure, now find that he is prepared
to defy bishops, priests and patriots paid and un-
paid. Parnell has hold of the money-bags and
will not unloose his grasp.
Sir Hercules Robinson in a letter to
Parkes:—“As in Canada, the United States,
and even in these [British] islands, there must be
in Australia a uniform tariff against the outside
world, and unrestricted trade internally and
coastwise throughout the whole Federal domi-
nion.”
Melbourne Age seems to be doubtful
whether war is not “ a divinely-appointed means
of working out natural selection, by showing
which party can kill the other off,” and seeks to
apply such a conclusion to the industrial war now
raging between squatters and shearers. Firestick
philosophy ?
In the democratic constituency of Colling-
wood (Vie.), 75 persons—shareholders in a
brewery limited liability co.—claimed to be
entitled to electors’ rights by virtue of their scrip.
Although opposed by the registrar acting under
instructions from the Chief Secretary’s office, all
the claims were allowed !
Young Nick Willis, M.L.A. (N.S.W.)
charges the prophet Egeson with having driven
hundreds of thousands of pounds of capital out
of the country by predicting drought and disaster.
The Prophet, in reply, is understood to allege that
Willis made a lot of capitalists clear out by in-
citing the crowd to take up arms.
One of the demands that Townsville
Separationists made to Premier Griffith was
that the far Northern colony should possess the
full control of all its alien labour. So the black
question—which belongs to United Australia and
not merely to North Queensland —is not so dead
as its secret friends pretend it to be ?
J. B. Patterson, late autocrat of the Vic-
torian Customs, a gas bag with the “cheek” to
say that “we want thinkers and not talkers”—
was to be entertained at a public banquet at New-
castle recently, said the cable. It would be in-
teresting to know who paid for Patterson's little
feed, and for the cablegram appertaining thereto.
The revenue of West Australia for the
last three years has shown steady improvement:
1888, £357,003; 1889, £375,329; 1890, £414,313.
During last year a lump sum of £27,000 was paid
in by the Hampton Plains syndicate, a London
co. who annexed 216,000 acres at 2s. 6d. per acre.
The cash was paid, and the syndicate have the
deeds!
“ Mr. A. J. Balfour, Chief Secretary for
Ireland, has,” it is cabled, “received the chgree
of Doctor of Laws from the Dublin University.
He met with a remarkable ovation.” So does the
Czar when he goes to Poland; so does the Kaiser
when he visits Metz. So, we might add, does
Burdett Smith whenever he honours Smithtown
with his presence.
Erastua Wiman writes powerfully in"last
North American Review, on the Canada ques-
tion —points out that a frontier of 4000 miles is
hampered and both nations annoyed by the
tariffs. When Sir John Macdonald passes off the
scene, all will be squared up. Canada’s trade
with the U.S., both in imports and exports,
greatly exceeds that with England.
Messrs. Young and Vivian, M.P.’s for the
Manning and Hastings, announce to the electors
of Taree that “Protection is dead.”
Two ghosts crawled from their graveyard nook,
And on the living world did look,
When, lo ! they heard a tread.
Beneath whose might the land fair shook—
One spectre said to his brother spook,
“That there live thing is dead.”
Queensland separationists are whooping
over the analysis of export returns. During
1890, Rockhampton exported goods to the value
of £2,057,319 —principally Western wool, Mount
Alorgan gold, and Lake’s Creek meat; Towns-
ville, £1,214,419, almost entirely wool and gold ;
and Brisbane (least of the three), £1,145,218. As
Brisbane outbulks in population Rockhampton
and Townsville combined, the significance of the
analysis is heightened.
An Orange (N.S.W.) press contributor
loudly declares that “ Protection is dead to the
world.” What world? Take out of the world
Protectionist Germany, Russia, France, Italy,
United States,- Queensland, New Zealand, Vic-
toria, South Australia, China and a few other
small places, and what remain ? Why, Hingland
and Orange (N.S.W.), which latter empire
manages to return a Freetrader to Parliament
by a majority of several votes.
Christian consistency ! The Church of
England Diocesan Synod, Melbourne, which de-
voted weeks upon weeks to synodical wrangling
about sectarian matters, has decided that the time
is not opportune for agitating the question of
religions instruction in State schools. The
Bulletin agrees with the latter conclusion, and
further believes that the time never will be oppor-
tune; but, from a church point of view, the in-
consistency is there all the same.
Secretary Houghton, in his annual report
to the N.S.W. Trades and Labour Council, sum-
marises the lessons of the strike : —“ It has taught
us to count well our chances before engaging in
such another conflict; to remove instanter the
dire scourge of sectionalism which has too long
existed among the unions in this country—nay, in
this city ; to marshall our forces for the ballot-box,
both parliamentary and municipal, for we are
devoid of friends in either senate; to amass a good
fighting fund, and not depend upon public sym-
pathy ; to avoid higher entrance-fees, so that the
unions will be open to all.”
Lord Jersey professes to be profoundly
struck by the surprisingly tall stature of N.S.W.
prominent public men—Parkes, Darley, Abbott,
Dibbs, &c. Which reminds us that Aristotle laid
down the rule that “all tall men are fools,” and
Bacon, in his 17th apophthegm, observes : “ My
Lord St. Albans said that Nature did never put
her precious jewels into a garret four stories high,
and therefore that exceeding tall men had ever
very empty heads.” Alessrs. Crick, Alelville, and
many other “pony ” public men are pleased to
agree with My Lord St. Albans.
It is significant that all the Australian
newspapers which have consistently supported
Irish Home Rule from really democratic motives,
are unswerving in their allegiance to Parnell ;
while the money-policy journals which, when the
Redmonds came here ridiculed the Irish cause,
and afterwards slewed round out of politic defer-
ence to growing public opinion, now jump upon
Parnell under the delusion that he is a crushed
man. All tha Irish-Australasian papers stick
to Parnell, some openly and others by discreet
abstinence of adverse comment.
The China Mail says :—“ It must be re-
■ membered that the Australians hate the Lascars.”
No, we don’t. We love them—at a distance. As
interlopers amongst local white labour, we don’t
want them at all. It is no question of love or
hate, but merely one of protecting the right of our
whites to live up to a free man’s standard. The
Lascar is a fine fellow —in his native lair. As
an alleged navigator, he’s a slummocker, a
fraud, a coward, and a willing sacrifice to the
boss sweaters. As a landsman immigrant, he is
an eyesore and a human cockroach.
The reason for Secretary Pulsford’s re-
tirement from the N.S.W. ' “ Ereetrade and
Liberal ” Association may be summed up in one
word—Cash. In 1888 the society was formed,
and a wealthy few guaranteed secretarial and
other salaries and expenses for three years.
Pulsford started with £5OO a year, and was
assisted by a clerk and office-boy, costing
another £3OO a year. The three years guaranteed
have elapsed, and the guarantors will not renew
their responsibilities. So Pulsford retired from
what the daily press called his “ honorary ”
billet, and the F. and L. A., which has loafed all
along on Mayor Burdekin, who practically gave it
free board and lodging, is bankrupt.
Dear Bulletin, —I am distraught from the
effects of reading a S.M. Herald editorial on the
American fiscal policy. You can’t “ have ’ these
Ereetrade acrobats. If a country like England
is Ereetrade, they trot out its imports, and say
that an excess of imports over exports is a sure
sign of achieved and increasing prosperity. If a
country like America is Protectionist, they trot
out the exports, and ask—“ How is it that the ex-
ports are so much less than the imports ? This
means blue ruin.” You see, they can’t be beaten
at flinging back-somersaults. Witli England,
surplus imports means millennium; with America,
excess of imports means sheol. I will now adjourn
to drink confusion to fiscal conjurors.—Yours, &c.,
The Dipsomaniac.

Parkes: “Please remember I am now an idle

It is the same old style and plan

General Sherman has died, aged 70. His
claim to immortality is the march “from Atalanta

but probably Grant was right. However, Uncle
Billy Sherman was the man to plunge with an
army of 60,000 into the enemy’s country, cut off
all his communications, and work on to success.
Captain Acland-Hood, aide-de-camp

and has to begin again at the beginning every

The best-preserved Melbonrnite is barris-

widow. He has hardly changed since 30 years
ago, when he was a moving spirit in the Land
Convention, with Wilson Gray, Ebenezer Syrne,
Dr. Owens, Don, Crews, and Alderman Keeley.
Keeley was good on bulls, but Ambrose Kyte
made the best when he referred in Parliament to
a rumour as a Brutus Fulcrum (Brutum Eulmen).

When Sir George Grey was Governor of
New Zealand, during his first term of that office,
he lent the Government of the day £lO,OOO to buy
native land for settlement in Hawkes Bay. The
Governor intended the land to be settled in
moderate-sized farms, but the Provincial authori-
ties, who got hold of the land after purchase,
simply divided it among themselves and rela
tions (the clique generally known as the Twelve
Apostles, Judas included), land worth at that time
£2 an acre being disposed of in large blocks for ss.
and even less. Afterwards, when Sir George had
removed to Cape Colony, the Government of N.Z.
repaid the loan without interest, and deducted
£7O charged by the banks for exchange !
Lady Florence Dixie on the O’Shea
situation: “I am not aware that at present
women are slaves and that man’s law has laid
down the rule that a woman may have no friend
outside her husband. It is a law that would
vanish with woman’s education and power of
freedom. The conclusion I have arrived at after
reading the trial is, that Mrs. O’Shea was for-
saken by her husband, and made friends with Mr.
Parnell. Treated by her husband as a mere beast
of burden, Air. Parnell treated her as a friend. I
recognise no law but the true law of justice. One
man appreciated her, the other treated her only
as the law regards her—as his slave. If Mr.
Parnell has sinned, let the greater number of our
politicians and statesmen retire from public life,
for they are worse than he.”
William M’Kinley, law-reporter and genial
Bohemian, died shortly after midnight on Satur-
day last. M‘Kinley was admitted to the Bar in
1867, and for a quarter of a century was the chief
law-ieporter for the Argus. His knowledge of
“case” law was wide, and his memory one of the
world’s wonders. It was his habit to take scanty
shorthand notes on scrappy tags of paper—any
irregularly-shaped “ tear-off ’ that came handy—
or on his shirt-cuffs, until “ M'Kinley’s notes”
passed into proverbial currency among the ink-
slinging “cult.” M'Kinley’s law reports were,
moreover, the unchallengeable bible of the Courts
when in search of Victorian precedents. A more
kindly-disposed and unselfish man never drew
breath on this earth,'and he was a universal
favourite at the Y oriole Club, of which he was a
member. For over 18 months his many friends
had watched with anxiety his visibly ebbing
vitality.
If the Sydney Town and Country's por
trait of Airs. O Shea is to be relied upon, then
Parnell should have got clear of his divorce-suit
by setting up a plea of incurable, rampant, howl-
ing insanity. According to that paper, the Irish
leader threw away his reputation and broke up
his party for the sake of two smudges, a big ink-
blot, a horse-bead, and a badly-disguised bag of
hay—in fact, the Journal’s siren is the sort of
object that any man might reasonably break his
neck getting away from—but when we are asked
to believe that Parnell hung round on cold,
damp nights for the sake of a smile from the
blackened spectre that bursts out on Alfred Ben-
nett’s pictured page, it is too much. If a man did
that sort of thing once he would straightway give
all his money to the Imperial Institute, and then
hang himself on the lady’s door-handle, so that
his remains might surprise her when she came out
next morning. It is the only wav he could get
level.
Friends of Henry George declare that his
recent withdrawal from the Standard is really the
most striking bit of self-sacrifice that has marked
his career. His managing lieutenants, it is said,
had become satisfied that the radical —the work-
ingmen—element ®f the party had withdrawn
from it for good, having lost confidence in Mr.
George and his methods, while on the other hand
it was difficult, with his former reputation as a
Socialistic and revolutionary agitator still cling-
ing to him, to make headway among the “respect-
able ” and well-to do. After a long struggle, as
the story goes, necessitating considerable finesse,
the lieutenants and the inner council of moneyed
men convinced Air. George that lie must retire,
at least for a time. The question of the retention
of one of his sons as a member of the staff, which
brought him to the verge of irritation with the
new proprietor, was at last accounts left unsettled.
This, at least, is the run of talk reported from the
Manhattan Single-tax Club, where there has been
prolonged emotional-conference over Mr. George’s
surrender of his paper, and where it is confidently
held there is still a field open for him in Australia.
The sister of the German Emperor is to
marry the Crown Prince of Italy, and as an
essential preliminary she is to abjure the Pro-
testant faith and become a Catholic. What in
thunder is the good of being that kind of a Pro-
testant, and still more, what is the good of being
that kind of a Catholic?
An election of aldermen took place last
week at Balgowlah—a small town situated some-
where in the vast wilderness where the population
consists chiefly of the oldest inhabitant and the
pound-keeper. When it was over the man at the
top of the poll returned thanks in an eloquent
speech, in which he stated that —“Some people
affect to despise borough councillors, but X can
assure them that they know no more of the glory
of the position than the mole knows of sunshine,
or the serpent of the eagle’s triumphant flight
through the upper air.” Who says that the Aus-
tralian isn’t a man of oratory.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla was the first successful blood
medicine ever offered to the public. This pre-
paration is still held in the highest estimation

and immense sales show this.


Wolfe’s Schnapps will do you no harm.
The T. and 0. Journal publishes a de-
pressing narrative about a bullock-driver who has
got into trouble out in the back-blocks. He had
got down to argue with one of his animals and
lay the matter before it in a new light, when the
brute stuck its horn through his lower jaw and
his tongue and part of his head, and then gave a
lift and hung him up by the teeth till they began
to give way beneath the strain. Just when he
was about to fall off, however, and leave his face
suspended on the old heifer’s horn and go on his
way rejoicing without any head or ear or counten-
ance, his mates observed him and lifted him
down. He is now in the hospital, and “tending
to recovery.” It is always the ambition of this
paper to encot rage local industry, and therefore
we are prepared to believe in the horn and the
teeth, subject fo the oidinary trade discount, if
the Journal will knock off the lower jaw and the
hospital. Or, if this arrangement doesn’t suit,
we are willing to place implicit faith in the
hospital and the bullock, provided anybody else
will takeover the bullock-driver and the rest of
the accident; or if tl e Journal will tone down
the assailant into a i lain goat we will take the
lot, even if we have to believe with the assistance
of a steam crane.

AYER’S HAIR VIGOR is unrivaled for
the restoration of faded and gray hair to its
original color and freshness, and for keeping
the scalp clean and healthy. The most popular
and elegant toilet preparation in the world, all
who use it, pronounce it, also, the best hair-
grower. When the capillary glands become en-
feebled by disease, age, or neglect, this dressing
imparts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its original
Fullness and Beauty.
Ladies find that this preparation imparts to the
hair a silken pliancy and a delicate and lasting
fragrance. Gentlemen use it to prevent bald-
ness, to restore faded and gray hair to its former
color and abundance, and to relieve the scalp of
troublesome humors and dandruff. A proof of
the superiority of this preparation over all
others of the kind is the constantly-increasing
demand for it in all civilized countries.

TOLD BY MYSELF.
It was my first introduction both to bush life and
to Australia, and my experience of a day during
the earlier part of my career still makes me feel
hot when I think of it. I had an only brother in
New South Wales, and I came out to join him
after we had been parted for some years. We
both had been left a little money ; he had invested
his in a cattle-station, and was doing well when I
landed in Sydney.
Let me premise that I am a woman, and was
then young and, I believe, good-looking, and very,
very verdant. My brother was a bachelor, and
almost immediately after my arrival I went up
country with him to his station and was installed
as housekeeper.
“Jenny, dear,” he said to me after a day or
two had passed, “ I shall be very busy for a few
days, and I want you to remember that out here
we aren’t tightly tied down by strict rules of
etiquette as in England. Possibly somebody will
call while I am out on the run ; if so, mind and
treat them hospitably, ask them to stop to dinner,
tell them I shall be back before evening, and
make them welcome.”
I duly promised.
“Remember,” he said, “you must not judge
men who come here by their dress. Some of them
may be pretty rough in their style, so you must
exercise your feminine tact a little, ” And so Ned
and I parted for the day.
It was very pleasant weather, and the novelty
of my surroundings had not worn off, so the
morning passed quickly.
About eleven o’clock I had a visitor. I was in
the somewhat rude garden, gathering a few
flowers for decorative purposes, when an elderly
man, carrying a roll of blanket over his shoulder,
as a soldier carries his great coat, came up to the
gate and looked over. Two of the dogs com-
menced to bark furiously as though they scented a
natural enemy.
“Beg pardon, Miss,” said the stranger man,'
but is the boss in ?”
“-No, he’s out on the run.”
“ Oh ! I suppose it will be all right for a bit of
tucker ?”
Though the wayfarer spoke in a language literally
unintelligible to me, I at once concluded that he
Bought hospitality. My brother’s instructions
flashed acrois ray mind,, and I immediately con-
cluded that this was one of the rough specimens
he had spoken of.
“ Come in,” I said, as graciously as possible,
and sit down.”
The old follow looked slightly bewildered, but
he opened the gate and followed me. He put his
rolled blanket down by the steps, and, at my in-
vitation, took a seat in one of the cane verandah-
chairs.
He was a remarkably uncouth and dirty speci-
men, and seemed very uncomfortable into the
bargain. I ventured on one or two remarks as to
the weather, to which he only replied, “ Yes,
Mis-.”
Was it too early to offer him any refreshment, I
wondered ? for I was anxious to fulfil my
brother’s wishes to the letter. I therefore went to
the cupboard to get some whisky. On my way I
met Sophy, a girl whom Ned had engaged for my
especial benefit. She was a nat. ve of the district,
and it struck me that she could tell me who my
queer visitor was. “ Just look out in the verandah,
will you, Sophy,” I said, “and tell me if you
know the old gentleman sitting there.”
Sophy put down her broom and went out to in-
vestigate. Presently she returned with a look on
her face impossible to describe. She was a good-
natured girl and desirous of not openly laughing
at me, but the situation was evidently too much
for her. “Old gentleman! Miss Perrier! why
he’s an old sundowner gammoning to look for
work. And you were going to give him Mr.
Perrier’s three-star whisky? Gracious!” And she
had her laugh out.
“ How can I get rid of him, Sophy ? ” I said
quite humbly.
“ My word, I’ll soon clear him out,” she re-
plied, and darting out on the verandah in less
than a minute I saw my late visitor on his way to
the men’s quarters.
Just then a horseman came in sight, and riding
up to the place. “ Who is that, Sophy?” I asked,
feeling rather nervous after my mistake.
“ It looks like young Thompson from the next
station,” returned my handmaiden after due in-
spection.
The new-comer soon put in an appearance on
the yerapdah. He wag a .tall, gawky yputh,
greatly sunburnt, and with very big hands. He
had on a cabbage-tree hat, worn very much at the
back of his head, which hat he, on seeing me, at
once pounced upon and took off; but unfortunately
he had the chin-strap between his incisors at the
time, and forgetting to open his mouth much
extra confusion and embarrassment was experi-
enced by him.
However, I felt on a sure footing this time and
rattled off a "volley of small talk that left the
youth nothing, to dp but opep his mouth in silent,
admiration. I found him as taciturn as the old’
man.
Luncheon-time drew near and I asked my guest
to take possession of my brother’s room to make
his toilette. To tell the truth, the conversation
was getting too one-sided altogether. Sophy put
the lunch on the table and duly rang the' bell, but
Mr. Thompson did not appear. For fully ten
minutes after the gong went great sounds of
scrubbing, splashing, and brushing proceeded
from the insnfficiently-divided'compartment.
After two more rings Mr. Thompson came out.
He had groomed himself to an alarming extent.
A bottle of gun-oil, kept by Ned in his room, had
been pressed into the service, and Mr. Thompson’s
hair was plastered down and combed smooth with
an elaboration that I certainly had not displayed
on my own coiffure.
A roast duck was on the table, and, feeling
quite unequal to the task of carving it, I asked
Mr. Thompson to take the head of the table.
The energetic way in which that silent young
bushman seized on the carving-knife I shall never
forget. In an instant, with one vigorous slash,
the duck lay in two halves on the di&h, and the
next moment one half was in a plate before me.
Now, I had been accustomed to trifle with the
wing of a fowl, and partake perhaps of a slice or
two of the breast, but to be expected to publicly
devour half a duck was rather a. strain upon my
good nature. However, my confrere attacked his
half and I followed the example, presuming that
it was the correct thing to do, and made it appear,
by judicious picking, that I was quite accustomed
to such mid-day repasts.
Presently Sophy brought in the pudding, which
was placed before me. Prompted by the spirit of
mischief, I cut it into two equal parts, and sent
one-half down to Mr. Thompson.
He took it with a look of intense gratitude, and
we finished the meal in the most sociable way.
My guest would not wait for my brother’s
return, and after hearing me talk for some
time prepared to take his departure. We shook
hands very cordially, and he started down the
garden, out of the gate, and I saw him mount and
depart, casting a backward glance as be did so.
Half-an-hour passed rapidly, in laughing over my
late experience; suddenly, to my surprise, Sophy
called out: “There’s Mr. Thompson back again.
What’s he forgotten?”
Sure enough there he was, coming, in a hesitat-
ing, half-hearted way, up the garden.
“ Miss Perrier,” he said, with his eyes examin-
ing the verandah floor, “I suppose you know
(which I didn’t) that the governor is very well off
—one of the warmest men about here ? Why, our
run is nearly alj freehold. When he dies I shall
have it all, but don’t you think I count on that.
He’s a good old boy, who gives me all the
money I want, and I hope he’ll live to a hundred.
But what he wants is to see me spliced. Now ”
(here he became the colour of red-hot beetroot) —
“do you think you will have me ? I’ve seen soirie
nice girls in my time, but never one like you, and
I’d make you a real good husband.”
Was this not a most embarrassing question to
put to an unprotected newchum? I had to
stammer a little before I could reply. Then I
said ; “Really, Mr. Thompson, I suppose I must
consider your offer very flattering, on such a short
acquaintance ; but I don’t think I can say ‘ yes ’
so suddenly. Yon seem to have a very good
nature, and inclined to share everything very
fairly—you gave me half of the duck at dinner.”
(“And you gave me half the pudding,” he mur-
mured) “but I think we had better wait until we
know each other a little better.”
He looked up and down the path, as though
expecting somebody to come to bis assistance,
then shook me again by the hand, and said,
“ Well, you know where to find me, I’m there
always;” and departed.
That was my first offer.
A Rockhampton witness, whose evidence
was directly “ suspicioned ” by the cross-examin-
ing solicitor, blurted out, with much virtuous
asperity : “ I wouldn’t come here to tell a lie for
so small an amount.”

homestead dummying involves would whitewash
Ananias by force of contrast,
A well-known Sydney speculator, who has
just bankrupted, lately found himself, from sheer
force of habit, attending a land-auction. He
hadn’t a copper to jingle against a tombstone.
Eleven acres of ground were put up but nobody
bid. The penniless speculator gave the auctioneer
a start with £4 10s. an acre, whereat the
auctioneer laughed derisively, as the land was
worth at least five or six times as much. This
aroused competition, and the bidding mounted up
to £l9 an acre, where it stuck. Mr. Stonebroke
thereupon offered an advance of half-a-crown.
The auctioneer at first declined to accept so
small an advance, but ultimately knocked down
the area to the sou-less man. The conditions of
sale were—2s per cent, cash; balance, on com-
pletion of deeds. The total price accepted was
£2lO 7s. Cd., and the auctioneer said a deposit of
£5O would do. Stonebroke coolly wrote out a
cheque for £5O, although he hadn’t a cent, at his
credit in any bank. As the bank-doors were
swung open at 10 o’clock next morning, he entered
and interviewed the manager, asking that his
cheque for fifty might be honoured. “Do you
mean to tell me,” asked the astonished banker,
that you have issued a cheque for £5O, and expect
“me to honour it, although the bank is already a
loser in consequence of your insolvency?”
“ That’s exactly the position,” calmly replied the
Busted One—“but I’ve got a good thing on.
After I cracked up last time I paid ray creditors
in full the first rise I made, and I mean to do it
again when I can.” Ultimately the bank-
manager, with whom our friend had had
big transactions in days gone by, let him
have the £5O, saying that if it were not
repaid he (the manager) would have to
suffer the loss personally. Stonebroke imme-
diately set a full gang of unemployed to work to
clear the land at once at £3 an acre. In a few
days, he received an application from the vendors
for the balance of the purchase money, and pro-
mised to pay up in full within a fortnight. The
vendors didn’t object, as they already held £5O.
He hurried on the clearing, and as soon as it was
finished, called on a moneyed acquaintance, led
him out to the property by the ear, and said—“ I
want you to lend me £5OO on this splendid piece
of land.” Which his friend did. Well—“ there
you are !”
AMERICAN GREATEST STATESMAN
At one of the large dinners given at the seat of
government lately, the great orator said : “Permit
me, ladies and gentlemen, to say that there is no
drink in the world so conducive to social inter-
course as the famous St. Louis Lager Beer. As
a mental and physical relaxative it has no equal.
It refreshes the body and exhilarates the mind.
It gently moves the blood to accelerated action,,
and arouses the more generous Sentiments that
cluster around the human heart. Its action in-
spires noble thoughts, and at the banquet table,
with intellect arid genius, it touches chords of
inspiration that prompt to lofty efforts.”

A Lesson from the Bee.
Deak Bulletin,— Your article on “ How the
Honey is Shared ” reminds one that the bee ha s
long been cited as an example of the benefits of
monarchism and selfish accumulation. It is now
the turn of the Socialist to draw illustrations
from the economy of this industrious insect.
First, let me knock the Royalty sham endways
with a hard brick of fact. The so-called “queen
bee is no monarch at all—inasmuch as she neither
grabs the taxes, nor declares war, nor rears a
gluttonous, unwholesome - looking “Royal”
family at the cost of the State, nor signs death-
warrants; she is not even a Defender of the
Faith, and has no hereditary rights or
privileges whatever. She is reared from
an egg that would, under ordinary cir-
cumstances have produced a common, plain
worker, but being provided with special food and
a roomy cell she has been enabled to develope—
entirely at the will of the community—into a egg-
layer. She is simply a mother, and directly she
becomes unfitted for her functions she is merci-
lessly slain and replaced by a young and vigorous
bee. But if she were a monarch and possessed
of all the grim powers and absurd privileges
of the by-the-grace-of-God article, the fact that
her life is twenty times the duration of the
ordinary bee would enable her to assume the posi-
tion with more show of reason than our Kaisers
and Victorias possess. If these had a lifetime
proportionate in length and could show that they
had made good use of it, respect and reverence
would naturally follow ; but the possibility
of the average monarch developing any in-
telligence or usefulness whatever even in
a thousand years is so unlikely that the
parallel may safely be dropped. The phase of
bee-life that the Socialist may most profitably
study is that relating to the drones. Strictly
speaking, one drone only is required for the pro-
pagation of the race, but the bees like a big
margin and raise a few hundreds to make a sure
thing of it. They build drone-cells, however,
for two distinct purposes : first' for the breeding
of these drones, and second for storing honey
under certain circumstances; and here is Just
where a ponderous moral lesson crops up. When
nectar is very abundant the thoughtless insects,
pushed for time and too greedy to pass by what
they do not require, run up drone-cells
for storage purposes as being more quickly
constructed than worker - cells ; but when
these in turn are emptied the queen
lays eggs in them —which, of course, develope
into drones. Thus, the very foundations of the
State, laid in greed, become a permanent source
of trouble; the ingredients that, rightly ad-
ministered, would produce workers, yield breeding-
places for privileged idlers. And although when
stores run short and starvation is imminent the
drones are thrown out, still the relief is only
temporary; the drone-cells are there, and fresh
drones are reared ; and the placid air with which
these loafers eat up the food that the workers are
slaving to obtain is keenly suggestive of what is
glibly styled “the relation of Capital to Labour.”
It is, moreover, a somewhat depressing fact that
though the workers periodically make a clean
sweep of the drones, the conditions for producing
a recurrence of the evil are allowed to remain.
Certainly the bee-keeper, perceiving the state of
affairs, may effectually remedy matters by
removing the drone-cells and substituting
worker - comb; but this is, akin to a
special Providence —and the connection just here
becomes vague. Philosophy says that man is
far superior to the animals in that he has the
choice to rise or fall; but when we can see new
States arising where man is free to build for
workers only, but ends in making provision for
an unlimited supply of idlers, it would seem that
mankind, on the whole, regards falling as the
easier mode of motion.

me out.” Bathurst has been improving since. Its
Corporation finds itself debited with an overdraft
of over £12,000, whereas it has been placidly
jogging along under the impression that the bank
limit was only £lO,OOO. No ledger has been kept
since October, 1889. Aldermen exonerate and
hold immaculate the present popular Town Clerk,
who has “ kept all the books as he found them

A witty rascal, one Duval, of Baltimore
(U.S.A.), has duped many U.S. senators. Pro-
curing somehow a stock of official baptismal
forms, he sent each senator a letter (with bap-
tismal certificate attached as proof) to the effect
that in reverential admiration of the said senator
he had named his son after him, and fervently
hoped the baby would, when grown to manhood,
strive to become as illustrious in the service of the
nation as his namesake. Flattered and proud,
most of the senators sent some present to Duval’s
address, which, by the way, was a drinking
saloon where he called for letters, and the swindler
raked in gold and silver mugs and dollar-bills
galore. Duval is a discharged post-office employe
and the polynomial baby a pure myth.
“The Briton’s Land.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the December number of the Journal
of the Royal Colonial Institute a vociferously
patriotic lawyer cf Melbourne named Dennistoun
Wood rises to ask in a deep, hollow tone about the
exact location of “ The Briton’s land.” He starts
by throwing the following statement off his chest:
Should German, Russ, or Frank demand what country is
the Briton’s land,
As no vain-glorious boast would I to that inquiry thus
reply:
Looking over the reply it appears that the Briton
owns pretty nearly all the earth, and that those
few unconsidered patches which he hasn’t got are
not worth counting. In fact, Mr. Wood’s
geography is built on the same pattern as that of
Jules Verne’s little nigger, who started his lesson
thus : “France, belonging to the English, capital
Calais, where the Governor, Lord Napoleon,
resides; Spain, belonging to the English, capita*
I Gibraltar.” However, this is a mere detail. The
really important point is that the bard from
Yarra’s dead-oat-strewn river has quite forgotten
to mention how the Briton got so much land. The
brief explanation which follows may enlighten
him on this matter ;
The Briton’s Land.
Should any grovelling wretch demand
What country is the Briton’s land,
And any brute whose soul is dead
Cast low reflections at his head,
We answer that he always got
All he could get—he took the lot;
He jumped the land, he boned the gold,
He snavelled all that he could hold,
And from the Poles to far Cathay
He faked things in a Christian way ;
And every article of worth
He sneaked from every tribe on earth,
And everything on earth he took
Save one —he never took his hook ;
And every place that came to hand
That was the Briton’s promised land.
Where’er the nigger asked for rum
There did his cherished Scripture hum,
And where brass gods were in demand
That was the Briton’s favoured land,
And 10 per cent, reduction he
Allowed upon a quantity;
And where the black inhabitants
Were very badly off for pants,
He came— and cleaned the pagan out,
And put his country up the spout;
Where’er men wanted guns on trust,
He sold them guns that always bust,
And by way .of security
He grabbed the earth, and stole the sea;
And when he found the tribes at strife,
He bore to them the Bread of Life.
And to each heathen he did preach,
And sold a rusted axe to each.
And when they caved each other in,
And each man stole the other’s gin,
And cut each other’s uncle up,
And used his skull for a drinking-cup,
And the tribes grew thin on the blood-stained
strand—
That, too, became the Briton's land.
He spread the Gospel near and far
(He was not too particular,
But he always took the Word along—
On this one point he came out strong),
He lifted up the pagan’s eyes
To mansions that are in the skies,
And then he knocked him on the head—
That heathen aforementioned ;j
Or shot him on some dusty plain,
Or hove him in the rolling main,
Or smashed him in a general way,
Then over his remains did pray
That, at the resurrection, he
Might live again by the Jasper sea,
And wander round amid the flowers
That blossom in Valhalla’s bowers,
And sing an everlasting song
The groves of Paradise among.
Or sometimes he put dynamite
Beneath that “brudder ” in the night,
And scattered him like grains of sand,
And his fields became the Briton’s land.
But now and then it chanced he fell
Upon some warlike infidel —
Some unregenerate son of gore—
Some mail-clad fiend on a lonely shore,
And to him there came a sadder fate
For that fiend became a syndicate,
And the Briton taught him how to be
A Loan and Mortgage'Company ;
And in his fastnesses and hills
He fooled around with notes and bills,
And the infidel was floated then
In shares paid up to one-pound-ten,
And eighteenpenny calls fell due
Unfailingly, each week or two,
Till the Buddhist’s clothes went up the spout,
And the bailiff sold the Moslem out,
And the Parsee saw his rose-strewn vale
Foreclosed beneath a bill of sale,
And the Brahmin looked from his mortgaged
towers
At the execution within his bowers,
And a lien was on the Sacred Cow,
And they all were broke—-they knew not how ;
Then they fell like leaves on the arid strand,
And their plains became the Briton’s land.
And thus it was the Briton spread
On many an isle far sundered ;
And still the pagan wants to know
Where the lands of his swindled fathers go,
And how they swapped for a rusted gun
The fairest vales beneath the sun,
And why he pays an endless tax
Because his uncle got an axe;
And how, in a general sort of way,
Things are as they seem to be to-day,
And wherefore the oily preachers tell
That the nigger who steals makes tracks for hell;
And, in short, he fails to understand
That the earth should be all the Briton’s land.

Test Them Free of Charge
What we are Prepared to do.
We are prepared to supply 100,000 of the Australa-
sian public with samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR
TABLETS, gratis and post free.
A Word of Advice.
Don’t write for the samples simply because we offer
them free of charge, nor because your neighbour does.
Read our advertisement through to the end, and then
decide whether you or vours need or would be benefited
by the use of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS.
We do not pose as philanthropists. This is a business
offer. We have an article that we know from severe
tests and from results achieved will sell on its merits if
seen, tasted and tested. Sulphur is the oldest, the best,
and safest remedy for the blood, for the skin, for the
complexion, for rheumatism, and for constipation.
FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS are composed of
sulphur incorporated with cream of tartar and other
curative ingredients. They are much more efficacious
than sulphur in milk or treacle. This has been proved
time and again. They are liked. Men favour them,
women hail them as a boon, and children think them as
pleasant to eat as confectionary. They benefit all, and
are as efficacious and curative as they are safe and agree-
able.
Their Success.
“ FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS” are the
latest and greatest British success. They have so much
merit as to always do good. They are so palatable and
agreeable that a child wifi take them with delight. They
are so safe that the weakest person may take them witffi
out injury. They benefit every function of the body by
tonic action on the blood vessels.
Why do we take this Risk ?
This is what people ask us. We reply, because
those who write for the samples afterwards buy packets
of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS by post from
us, or obtain them from chemists, stores, or medicine
vendors. People likewise recommend and keep the
Tablets by them. The consequence is that we sell several
hundred dozen packets weekly, and the sale is rapidly
growing* This is trade by merit. The public have
shown discrimnation, and that they can appreciate merit,
and it was in firm reliance that this would be the case
that we Were led to incur this risk.
Do 1 need them?
If you have Rheumatism, Yes. They will kill the
decomposed and poisonous excess of uric acid in the blood
causing the disease.
If you have Constipation, Yes. They are a gentle,
safe, and a simple laxative, as suitable for children fin
smaller doses) as for adults.
If you have Hemorrhoids, Yes. They relieve the
congestion of venous blood at the affected parts, and
afford relief
If you have Ulcers, Scrofula, Scurvy, or other
impurities of the blood, Yes. They neutralise the blood
poisons causing the diseases and expel them out of the
system.
If you have Skin Disease or Eruption, Yes. They
have a specific curative effect on all such, as they open
the pores from internally, and free them from obstruction
and disease taint. They likewise control where they do
not kill the disease principle from the blood, which causes
Eczema and other diseases.
Write a letter or post-card to the Australasian Depot, naming The Bulletin, and samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS
will be sent you gratis and post fi- \ They are for internal use for the Blood, Skin, Fevers, Complexion, Rheumatism, and Constipation. They

What folly it would be to cut grass with a pair of scissors! Yet peo-
ple do equally silly things every day. Modern progress has grown up
from the hooked sickle to the swinging scythe and thence to the lawn
mower. So don’t use scissors!
But do you use SAPOLIO ? If you don’t you are as much behind the
age as if you cut grass with a dinner knife. Once there were no soaps.
Then one soap served all purposes. Now the sensible folks use one soap
in the toilet, another in the tub, one soap in the stables, and SAPOLIO
for all scouring and house-cleaning.

The democratic Melbourne Age always
speaks of “Capital and Labour” —puts the cart
before the horse—the dispensable before the indis-
pensable.
Two men, who assisted Constable Bevan
to recover the body of Edward Loch, drowned
while trying to cross the flooded Mary River,
annexed and divided four shillings which fell from
the corpse’s pockets, claiming the same as
legitimate payment for “lost time.”
James Blackley claims to be the “ ringer”
of the Bourke district wool-sheds this year. On
the Dunlop station, where 200,000 sheep were
shorn, Blackley sheared 212 jumbucks during a
working day of eight hours. In forty hours he
sheared 338, being at the rate of 2g minutes for
each sheep.
The new Mayor of Brisbane is “Blue-
Ribbon” Clark, a snip by trade and a “social
reformer ” by “special mission.” Toast-and-water
banquets will now be the Aldermanic recreation,
and when Clark gives “a nop” the refreshments
will be limited to coffee unroyal and pop without
a stick in it.
Mrs. O’Shea is described as having the
thin lips and bulging brow we see on the Cleopatra
medals, and as being as cold-blooded ordinarily as
Cleopatra was known to be. She is not a very tall
or big-boned woman, but is ruddy and full-
blooded ; her hair is blonde and profuse, and her
complexion is fair.
An agitation is begun again to introduce
cadets into the Victorian Police instead of finding
officers from the ranks of the force. The plan is
too thin—the idea being that the police are too
much in sympathy with the proletariat, viewing
the contingency of strike riots, wherein citizen
soldiers declare they will not take up arms against
the People. -
Yates, in the World, denies that Sir J. E.
Millais, artist, was ever in Australia, and he ought
to know. The current statement is that Millais
was working on the Bendigo goldfield somewhere
about the time that Premier Salisbury visited it,
this latter fact being well enough certified. Salis-
bury was in Melbourne and Bendigo about 1852,
and, now Childers and Lowe have retired, no
other English forward statesman has a like ex-
perience.
When the Gordon Gumming slander cases
come on for trial we suppose that “ Wales ” will
be permitted to asseverate his say-so “on my
honour as a gentleman,” instead of being required
to “ kiss the book ” after the manner of common
mortality. He has gone through this farce before,
when he was placed in a position in which every
“real gentleman” would brazenly tell a lie in
order to save some of the reputation of a lady.
Editor Bulletin, —We do not think
the health-giving properties of the banana are
appreciated by the fruit-eating public, who merely
look upon it as a cheap edible when other fruits
are scarce or out of season. Cut in slices, the
banana makes an excellent salad served with
mayonnaise dressing; curried, it is far more palat-
able than either fish or meat; boiled as a veget-
able, while green, in the skin, for three hours, and
peeled before sending it to table, it will be found
excellent. It also makes an extremely delicious
pudding for the nursery, served in a pie-dish,
covered with sweet milk and some sugar and
baked for an hour in a moderately quick oven.
Many children in Fiji can with truth assert in
regard to the banana—“His is wot I growed on.”
A most agreeable breakfast-dish is to be made by
frying slices of bacon, and then slices of banana in
the hot bacon fat, with plenty of pepper, and
serving together as one does a dish of bacon and
eggs. These are a few -of the many ways of
utilising this most accessible fruit for both rich
and poor.—Yours faithfully, O’Kelly & Brown,
banana-growers, Nanua River, Fiji, 16—1—’91,

Gladstone’s R.O, Disability Bill, to enable
Catholics to be appointed to the Lord Lieutenancy
and the Lord Chancellorship of Ireland, has been
defeated in the Commons by a majority of 33.
And yet there have been R.O. Viceroys of India.
Sir T. Cockburn-Campbell, one of the
W.A. delegates to London in connection with the
recent legislation granting a constitution to that
province, has been appointed President of the
nominated Legislative Council, conditionally on
his relinquishing his connection with the local
press. This condition has been complied with,
and Mr. Hackett now edits the West Austra-
lian.
Canada, The Bulletin predicts, will not
be permitted to purchase Alaska : the sentiment
of the Republic would be outraged by the sale of
a single inch of territory.
Says Sydney Echo : —
Ona of the most satisfactory signs of the present time,
however, is that the colonies are slowly and gradually,
perhaps, but surely, uniting, without waiting for the
appearance of the outside foe; and, as a proof that this
is a spontaneous and genuine movement on the part of
the people, we find that the anniversary of the first
settlement is being celebrated in Melbourne with Cale-
donian sports and other demonstrations.
Editor Stronach’s entertaining non sequitur is
based on the deplorable fact that he is himself a
pure-bred Scotchman.
Says Froude, in his monograph on Bea-
consfield:—
Disraeli failed, as he deserved to fail. He thought that
he was reviving patriotic enthusiasm, and all that he did
was to create jingoism. ... No public man in Eng-
land ever rose so higli and acquired power so great, so
little of whose work has survived him. . . . Possibly
if among his other gifts lie had inherited an English
character, he might have devoted himself more completely
to great national questions ; he might even haveinseribed
his name in the great roll of English worthies. But he
was English only by adoption, and he never completely
identified himself with the country which he ruled. At
heart lie was a Hebrew to the end.
Dora Femi’s history was peculiar. She
was one of our pioneeresses and Cockatoo peeresses,
such as they are. About a century ago in London
she was famous as a ladies’ nurse and lying-in-
ordinary woman amid the Peerage, but her little
game was to plunder right and left, Until at last
she got at the gold watch, diamonded in 29 holes,
of a Marquis of Carabas, besides a magnificently-
jewelled order of his, worth £600. She was
wheedled out of the latter, on a promise that there
was to be no prosecution, after which she went to
what Squeers spells as Bot-tin-ey, and married A-
convict who became a very rich squatter.
Fronde’s “Disraeli” glozes over Dizzy’s
worst mistake, when he stole holus-bolus. General
Foy’s eulogium of General Gourion St. Cyr for
his epithalamium, in the House of Commons, on
the Duke of Wellington. This was unpardonable,
an index to the essential hollowness of the man,
his charlatanry, never to be effaced by all his
ability. But the speech was undeniably the best
of the occasion, and Dizzy swallowed all the com-
pliments —just as did a now-deceased N.S.W.
politician who had the cheek to pronounce in
public an original panegyric on Garibaldi, stolen
word for word from the Masonic burial-service.
Attorney-General Clarke (Tasmania) has
drafted an Australian Federal Constitution on
the Yankee model. Clarke proposes a British
Governor-General (say a Royal Prince, to speedily
disgust us into a Republic), a Senate and House
of Representatives, then provincial legislatures
which shall elect their own provincial or Lieut.-
Governors. Federal, as distinguished from
provincial powers are defined, but it would be
premature to discuss their details. The world
now waits for Premier Griffith, of Queensland, to
expose his plans and specifications, which may or
may not be partially foreshadowed by his already
unfolded local decentralization antidote to tri-
partite territorial separation. Mr. Clarke, while
preferring the United States as a model for Aus-
tralian unity, thinks that Canada is “too
advanced for the colonies !”
There are two sides to the question now in
dispute at Sydney School of Arts, as to whether
women shall or shall not be admitted to full
membership at half rates. On the one hand,
women in all vocations of life are only paid half
the wages demanded by men, and are, therefore,
only able to pay a half-share of the cost of leisured
luxuries. This is due doubtlessly to their own
helplessness, but all the same the men who use
female labour loaf on the women they employ to
the extent of half the current rate of male wages.
When, as The Bulletin advocates, the work
done by every competent female employe is paid
for at the same rate as that of a similarly com-
petent male, lovely woman may be fairly asked to
put up her fair share of general expenses for
general privileges. On the other side of the ledger
is the undoubted fact that the average lady
member of the School of Arts gives twice as much
trouble as the average male, and, in the light of
services rendered, ought to be charged double.
We leave the subject at that, with the prophecy
that the women will “get there all the same.”

fresh vigor into the Debilitated Constitution, Stimu-
lating the Vital Organs to their proper action and en-
abling nature to throw off numerous diseases.

To H. F. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir -This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away' until

to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you. and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in “March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vormted about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaming in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.

Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s

County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
