LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
THE PILL
Sir,
I would like to thank the priest who
wrote “A Catholic Cure for the Pill”
(11/7/64) for saying what so many
Catholics have been thinking and dis-
cussing, but which up till now has been
dismissed rather summarily by many of
the clergy in Australia. Many non-
Catholics must be of the opinion—quite
understandably—that Catholics have
been burying their heads in the sand
if they judge by public pronounce-
ments on this matter.
I completely agree with his only too
true comments on the “Four Corners”
interview. As a Catholic I felt com-
pletely ashamed of two of the panellists.
If I had not been a Catholic, I would
have assumed this was typical of the
general Catholic feeling, and any respect
I might have had for its members
would have evaporated before their
shilly-shallying.
The fact that Australia is geographi-
cally isolated has shown up in our
attitude to many things, and also, un-
fortunately, extends —unavoidably, I
suppose—to religious issues. What
makes us think that we know the
answers in black and white, when people
in other countries do not? Why do so
many in authority seem to feel that to
admit uncertainty is synonvmous with
admitting defeat, and therefore enforce
as hard facts what can only be their
opinions? Surely without convincing
reasons this stand, far from quieting
doubts, only creates more.
It is understandable that, after the
Reformation, for a time all questioning
was regarded as highly suspicious. This
lack of public concern would have been
accentuated by the fact that Catholics,
for the most part, lost their rights, and
as a result became an uneducated class.
But all this is past, and yet still we are
not encouraged to think. As a result
the laity have forgotten that they have
a rieht and a duty to question intelli-
gently and to criticise constructively.

Pill question completely closed. In my
letter in the same issue I had said
explicitly that I did not consider it closed.
The Pope has asked us to avoid public
airing of views for the time (as I also
stated) and said we should follow for the
present the norms taught by Pius XII;
but private discussions can certainly
continue while we await the public
statement Paul VI has promised.

tinction between private and public dis-
cussions on the Pill. Ed.]
Sir,
When you speak of “Catholics and
the Pill” do you mean Roman Catholic?
I would like to point out that in many
churches we state we are members of
the Holy Catholic Church, but this is
not Roman Catholic. In the Presby-
terian, Anglo-Catholic, Low Church of
England, Methodist and other Protestant
churches we call ourselves Catholic,
which only means universal.
(Mrs) V. RASSMUSSEN

POLITICS IN MALAWI
Sir,
In your issue of July 18 a special
correspondent mentions that in Malawi
(formerly Nyasaland) “no Opposition
voice has been heard from a public plat-
form since 1961, when Dr Banda’s
Malawi Congress Party took 95 per cent
of all votes cast. At this year's, general
election no one at all came forward to
challenge his personal nominations”.
In fact, for the first time in Common-
wealth history, no general election was
held at all. The “party list” (50 candi-
dates) was returned unopposed because
the Mbadwa Council of Nyasaland Citi-
zens—the African Opposition party—
had previously withdrawn, for reasons
given in a petition to the Governor, Sir
Glyn Jones. It stated that “members and
supporters” of Dr Banda’s party had
already murdered 56 Mbadwa Party
members, including one of its leaders;
had seriously assaulted hundreds “with
knives, bush-knives, knobkerries, bicycle
chains”; had “thousands”;
and had burned “thousands” of homes
and farm buildings, killed livestock and
uprooted crops; all in a campaign of
intimidation to prevent Opposition sup-
porters from even registering as voters,
let alone voting.
The petition claimed that, under
orders from Dr Banda’s government,
the police took no action against the
intimidators. It quoted the Commis-
sioner of Police himself to that effect.
It also claimed that vote registration
officers who were also members of the
Malawi Congress Party had registered
many of its supporters, “including
thousands of schoolchildren”, who were
under age. To save further life and
property from loss and threat, the
Mbadwa Party had decided to withdraw
and requested (in vain) the Governor's
intervention.
The foregoing summarises a verbatim
report in the April 23 issue of the Lon-
don weekly review, “East Africa and
Rhodesia”.
It is not suggested that the story
would be very different if the Mbadwa
Party were in power and the Malawi
Party in opposition. “Britain has never
ruled an African colony with the despo-
tism of the new African leaders”, says
an editorial in the “Anglican Eagle”,
published by the Diocese of Northern
Rhodesia. “Perhaps this is why British
policy failed. The leaders of the New
Africa know that their people are not
ready for democratic rule”.
This is also why the white, brown and
black civilised minority in Southern
Rhodesia will not submit to “African
majority rule”—and one hopes it is why
Sir Robert Menzies will not commit
Australia to any attempt to force them
to do so.

DECIMAL CURRENCY
Sir,
R. W. Parry (11/7/64) raises the
question as to whether the majority of
Australians are totally satisfied with the
planned use of “dollars” and “cents”
for the decimal currency units. I be-
lieve myself that most of our people
approve the change to decimal currency,
which will give us a simpler monetary
system and provide a link between Aus-
tralia and the other nations (95 per cent
of the world) which use decimal cur-
rency. But I also believe that a con-
siderable body of electors, like myself,
would prefer to see the continued use
of traditional British names which we at
present share with New Zealand and
the United Kingdom. When the dual
currency transitional period is over I
would like “cent” to be given the per-
missible alternative name of “penny”.
I would also like 10 cents to be termed
one “shilling”. Then fifty cents (half-
dollar) could be given the alternative
name “one crown” and the term “one
pound' could be used to describe “two
dollars”.
J. F. BLADES
Riverton (SA).
Sir,
A country with our defence and
development problems, still largely de-
pendent on the export demand for one
product for our overseas earnings, needs
to be sure it is getting value for its
money. Can we say this in respect of
the cost of decimal currency? It is
difficult to be convinced the rather
abstract benefits are worth the cost.
In any case, we can have decimal
currency with a simple alteration to the
values of some of our existing coins
as Mr R. W. Parry (11/7/64) points
out. Why do we need a completely
new currency?
If it came to a question of decimal
currency or, say, another destroyer,
which would you choose?

Right back to early days of the colony, Australians felt and
stirred to the challenge of “The Great Thirst.” Men, whose
names illuminate our history as the explorers of the inland,
became obsessed with one driving urge—to find water . . .
perhaps an inland sea or new, wide waterways. Their epic
journeys, on which many of them died of thirst, indicated a
prospect that today we have come to accept . . . Australia is
desperately short of readily available water.
So, the search for water and conquest of the wastelands became
part of the character of Australians. Since 1887, when a start
was made on the first planned large-scale irrigation development
in the hot sands along the Murray, Australia’s “Water Men”—
irrigation pioneers, conservation planners and engineers, scien-
tists, agricultural advisers, and the men on the land—have
waged a continuous battle to bring water to the dry but fertile
plains. Their efforts have received the blessing of mighty con-
servation projects like the ‘Snowy Scheme,’ Eildon in Victoria,
Tinaroo in Queensland, the Ord in the north . . . much more
remains to be done.
The future is a twofold challenge ... the further development
of water knowledge and management, and increasing food pro-
duction. We believe that Australia will play a vital role as a
food producer in a hungry world.
It is estimated that in just ten years, our own increased popula-
tion will be eating the equivalent of almost all the food we now
export. Yet, today, our overseas markets for food are expanding
dramatically. Thus, it is anticipated that a 25% increase in
production will be required plus whatever is necessary to meet
increased export demand.
These considerations become important when related to the
world situation. It has been stated by Professor J. R. A.
McMillan, Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture at the University
of Sydney, that “the greatest problem in the world today is the
production of food and the greatest limiting factor to food
production is the shortage of fresh water. This applies to crop
and animal production. There is hardly any part of the world
which is not short of fresh water for agricultural purposes at
some time.”
We believe that irrigation expansion and the gaining of maxi-
mum efficiency in the use of our water resources will be vital
to our future as a nation and to the prosperity of our people
. . . water will pipe the tune to our progress.

SEMINAR FOR WRITERS
Sir,
We appreciate the coverage you gave
us in the article on the Seminar for
Writers organised by the Australian
Radio, Television, and Screen Writers’
Guild (18/7/64), but unfortunately
there were several inaccuracies in the
statement attributed to me. I am sure
they were caused unwittingly by your
writer paraphrasing the conversation he
had with me, but I would like to correct
them. The most serious misquote re-
fers to the “Jonah” series, produced by
ATN.
This series did not fall through be-
cause of any demand by the Guild for
overseas sales and replays. This was
a matter purely between Actors Equity
and ATN, on actors’ payments, and the
Guild was not involved in the dispute.
A number of Guild writers preferred,
individually, not to work on this series
unless the principle of residual payments
and overseas rights was established, but
no official directive was given to mem-
bers. Indeed, several Guild members
did contribute scripts to the “Jonah”
series, and since then all writers who
worked on the series have become
Guild members. Also, since then, we
have negotiated a very satisfactory
agreement with ATN in regard to the
writing of drama scripts.
Bob Raymond, of TCN, did not, in
fact, address the opening session of the
seminar. He’d been programmed to do
so. but owing to work commitments
connected with his overseas trip he had
to send his apologies a ffiw davs before
the seminar opening. He will present
his address on his return from London.

GOLDWATER
Sir,
Now that Senator Barry Goldwater
has confounded all the “experts” by his
sweeping victory at the Republican
Party Convention, may I suggest that
The Bulletin could render its readers
a real service by presenting a much
more accurate picture of Goldwater
and the current American political situ-
ation than the one given by George
McGann (11/7/64). I was reporting
from the USA late in January, and
again in May of this year, that so far
from the “experts” being correct when
they claimed that it was “unthinkable”
that a man like Goldwater could be-
come the Republican Presidential can-
didate, it was almost certain that he
would be elected. The Goldwater
phenomenon cannot be understood
without knowledge of the deeply-
rooted upsurge of conservatism in the
USA today. Instead of objectively
reporting on this phenomenon, the
“experts” tried to smear it out of exist-
ence by references to “the lunatic
fringe”. They were reporting their own
prejudices instead of the true position.
There were many glaring untruths and
distortions in McGann’s article. I Sllb .
mit just a few:
Goldwater could not have “backed
down” concerning the use of nuclear
weapons in South Vietnam, for the very
simple reason that so far from advo-
cating this policy, he rejected it. The
text of Goldwater's statement, which I
have before me, proves this beyond all
argument.
Goldwater has not “taken issue with
certain wild-eyed tenets of Birch faith
such as the accusation that Eisenhower
is a dedicated Communist”. There is
no such “tenet” of the Birch Society.
“The Birch element” are not “em-
barrassed when someone brings up the
subject of Goldwater’s Jewishness”. And
there is no “strong anti-Semitic flavor
in the Birch Society”. Either George
McGann is very ignorant about the
Birch Society, or he is being deliberately
careless with the truth in order to
further what is in fact a smear article.
ERIC D. BUTLER

JIM JUPP
Sir,
Your correspondent Jim Jupp
(4/7/64) leaves us with an impression
of political purity untarnished. It must
give him much personal satisfaction to
know that he, above all, has attained
that state of detached objectivity so
sought after by the (sic) political scien-
tist.
It is quite obvious that he has over-
come his radical beginnings (former
official of student socialist clubs) and
their natural extension (member of the
Victorian ALP since 1957).
Naturally it is wrong to praise
Mr Santamaria. It is impossible for
the National Civic Council to ever be
right on anything, particularly the Com-
munist problem. After all, they have
only been fighting it in Australia for 23
years. For shame that people would
impute any charitable motives to good,
kind, unbiased Mr Jupp.
JAMES F. HARDING
Doubleview (SA).
• The last two paragraphs of a letter
from Dr F. Knopfelmacher published in
the issue of July 25 were cut for reasons
of space. Dr Knopfelmacher has request-
ed that we publish them, as they “qualify”
his statement about Mr Santamaria.
Following are the omitted paragraphs.
—Ed.:
His [Mr Santamaria’s] role in Aus-
tralian politics is not unlike that of
Churchill in England at the time of
Munich. And one could have been a
supporter of Churchill in 1938-39 with-
out becoming a Tory or a member of
the Beefsteak Club.
Mr Jupp has known my views on
Santamaria and on other public issues at
least since 1957, if only because I have
repeated them often and in public. It
is odd that it should have taken him six
years to find them unbearable.

It sounds ridiculous, but frankly, we’re looking for a
name to describe Avery Labels. Some people call
them self-adhesive... other refer to them as pressure-
sensitive, or self-sticking.
In point of fact, all are quite correct, but don’t go
far enough. For instance:
Avery labels require no. moisture or glue to stick
down. □ Avery labels are,applied with just the
lightest pressure of the finger. □ Avery labels can
be stuck on wood, glass, paper, plastics, metal or any
clean smooth surface. □ Avery labels are made of
paper, foil, acetate or cloth. □ Avery labels are made
in two types permagrip for permanent adhesion
and kum-kleen for temporary adhesion.
If you feel you can name this unique Avery self-
adhesivepressure-sensitiveself-stickinglabel, Avery
will be pleased to pay ten guineas for the most
appropriate submissions.

C.S.R. Co’s Annual Report
Points from chairman’s address to shareholders
In his annual address to shareholders, the Chairman of The Colonial Sugar Refining
Company Ltd., Mr. J. W. Dunlop, referred to:
• record total production at the company’s sugar mills in Australia and Fiji
• heavy capital expenditure in the company’s sugar mills to increase capacity
• improvement in C.S.R. activities in building materials and industrial chemicals.
The C.S.R. Company’s profit for the year was earned from widespread activities
in raw and refined sugar, building materials, chemicals, distillery products and ships,
from services and from investments in Australia, Fiji, and New Zealand.
Some points made by Mr. Dunlop were:
Mr. J. W. Dunlop, Chairman
of the Colonial Sugar Refining
Company.
Sugar••MilNng : 1
Total C.S.R. production of raw
sugar: During the 1963 season
production of raw sugar by the
C.S.R.’s seven Australian mills
and the four Fiji mills of our
subsidiary, South Pacific Sugar
Mills Ltd., was a record 652,000
tons.
C.S.R.’s Australian Mills
The company’s Australian
mills produced 353,000 tons of
raw sugar in 1963. This was
slightly better than the previous
(1962) record.
For 1964 the areas of cane
for harvest and sale to our mills
will be larger. Milling capacity is
being expanded and the produc-
tion objectives for 1965 and 1966
are greater than for 1964. Heavy
capital expenditure on our Aus-
tralian mills will continue for
some time.
Fiji
South Pacific Sugar Mills Ltd.:
Our subsidiary, South Pacific
Sugar Mills Ltd., and the other
sections of the industry had a
very successful 1963 season.
As part of a continuing pro-
gramme of expansion, substantial
increases have been made in
milling capacities for 1964, and
production from the crop now
being harvested is expected to be
about 320,000 tons of raw sugar,
about 20,000 tons more than in
1963.
Other Fiji Matters: There will
soon be changes in the Crown
Colony system of Government;
the people of Fiji, through their
elected representatives, will have
greater responsibility for their
own affairs.
We are helping these develop-
ments where we can, acting with-
in and not beyond our proper
sphere of interest and activity.
South Pacific Sugar Mills and
C.S.R. regard themselves as part
of the Fiji community and we
hope to continue to play a con-
structive role in improving its
situation.
•.
’ v .Refined. Sugar
Australia: Sales of refined
sugar products from our Austra-
lian refineries for the year ended
31st March, 1964, were 554,000
tons, 1.3% more than in the pre-
vious year.
We are continuing our long-
term programme to expand refin-
ing capacity to meet market
needs. Much new equipment has
been installed in recent years.
New Zealand: In mid 1963 the
rise in the world free market
price of raw sugar made higher
prices necessary for refined sugar.
Sales of refined sugar at 118,000
tons were 3.3% less than in the
previous year.
|k||:sUgar' Industry Matters
Australian Raw Sugar
Production
Australia produced 1,678,000
tons of raw sugar in the 1963
season, 124,000 tons below the
record 1962 crop. (C.S.R.’s
share of this production was
353,000 tons, or about 21 %.) A
major effort has been made to
increase output in 1964, and a
substantial rise is expected in
spite of drought in some dis-
tricts.
Expansion in the
Australian Sugar Industry
The Gibbs Committee recom-
mended a production of 2,200,000
tons of raw sugar for the seasons
1965, 1966 and 1967, rising to
2,500,000 tons by 1970.
A good proportion of the
higher profits which came to the
industry from last year’s high
world sugar price is being
“ploughed back”; this will result
not only in a larger Australian
sugar industry but in a more
efficient one.
The World Price
A surplus of supplies of sugar
over requirements on the world
market is not estimated for the
remainder of 1964, and in conse-
quence no basic weakness in the
market price seems likely in that
period. Especially in the longer
run, the future of the world price
is not predictable, but we do not
expect a return to the extra-
ordinarily low prices of a few
years ago.
International Sugar
Agreement
The International Sugar Agree-
ment remains in force until
December, 1965, but its restric-
tions on exports are not in opera-
tion.
British Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement
This agreement remains of
great importance to both Austra-
lia and Fiji. The agreement was
extended for another year to the
end of 1971.
United States Market
Under the U.S. Sugar Act,
Australia has a “statutory quota”
to supply about 34,000 tons per
year, and Fiji about 8,500 tons.
In addition, the United States
authorities allocate “global quo-
tas,” on a yearly non-continuing
basis. So far for 1964 Australia
has been allocated about 150,000
tons and Fiji about 38,000 tons.
These compare with 154,000 and
32,000 tons respectively for 1963.
Japan
It will be recalled that in 1963
buyers in Japan agreed to buy
between 350,000 and 450,000
tons per year, for three years.
This agreement has now been ex-
tended to cover sugar from the
1967 season.
The Malaysian Market
Malaysia is setting up its own
sugar refining industry. We are
glad that both Australia and Fiji
are already established as sup-
pliers of raw sugar to the new
refinery.
Building Materials
Sales of C.S.R. building
materials have increased.
We have developed a consider-
able export business for some of
our products. Profits on exports
are small but the business is
worthwhile and we are pursuing
it actively.
Fibreboard Group: Sales of
our Masonite and Timbrock
brand hardboards in Australia
were higher than for some years.
C.S.R. Floor Tiles: Sales have
increased satisfactorily.
Pyneboard: The rate of growth
of the Australian particle board
market slackened in 1963.
Gypsum Products: Sales of
Gyprock have improved consid-
erably.
Bradford Insulation (85%
C.S.R.): The 8.1. companies are
making good progress.
Australian Blue Asbestos Pty,
Ltd.: The tonnage of blue asbes-
tos sold both overseas and in
Australia has slowly improved.
W• ■ t
industrial Chemicals

C.S.R. Chemicals Pty. Ltd.
(60% C.S.R.): Sales of industrial
chemicals and plastics from the
factories of C.S.R. Chemicals and
its associated companies, have in-
creased and production generally
is now higher than ever before.
Other Hatters
It is impossible to predict the
course of events accurately when
there are so many uncertainties,
but on present indications we ex-
pect the profit for the current
year to approximate that for the
year ended 31st March, 1964.

This company believes that
there are some practices which
should be brought under im-
partial scrutiny and control.
Our concern is not to avoid
all legislation but to try to make
sure that, before any legislation
is adopted, the present proposals

What importance do you place on your business records? It's
easy to say “Nothing will happen to them,” but it is not always
the other fellow that is devastated by fire ... it could be you!
Only specially built fire-resistant equipment, such as the range
built in Australia by Chubb, can make your records —your
business memory—completely safe from fire. The fact that a
building is fireproof does not alter the fact that the contents of
the building remain inflammable. Today, with the introduction
of the many synthetic materials into office furniture, a fire in a
modern building can create an even more intense heat than
previously experienced. And how do you assess, for an insurance
claim, the list of your outstanding accounts or a secret file that
may have taken years to compile. Make a point to contact Chubb
and to examine the comprehensive range of fire-resistant record-
protection cabinets. It pays to be careful when your business
is at stake.

Your factory can become a landmark,too!
A well known landmark on the Pittwater Road is the Bond’s factory at Brookvale.
As you drive along this wide arterial highway, the factory stands clear against the
skyline, giving full value to the identifying signs advertising Bond’s products.
‘Turn left at the Bond’s factory’...‘two hundred yards past the Bond’s factory’...
these are directions that are clear, and unmistakable. Certainly part of the local
vocabulary. Mackellar County can still provide prestige sites on major roads.
Situated here, your factory or plant would be only 10 miles from the heart of the
city of Sydney. Close to choice residential areas, t00...y0u can leave home later,
and still arrive in your office earlier than before. You’re fresh, relaxed, ready for
the day’s responsibilities.
Mackellar County encourages industrial investment.
The industrial areas are only ten miles from the heart of the
city, yet surrounded by unspoiled bushland. Careful inter-
relation of industrial and residential areas close to main
highways, public transport, schools and shopping centres
have put this county years ahead in area development
planning. Mackellar County provides an efficient system of
arterial highways...plenty of space for growth and expansion
...pleasant surroundings for greater plant efficiency...estab-
lished residential areas for both executives and staff.

National Notebook
gill Rutledge
WE report with regret the death last
week of Mr William M. Rutledge,
The Bulletin’s chief finance sub-
editor. Mr Rutledge came to The
Bulletin after it incorporated “The
Financial Times”.
Mr Rutledge had more than 50 years
in journalism and was a foundation
member of the Australian Journalists’
Association. At various times Mr Rut-
ledge filled executive positions on many
papers, including the Brisbane “Sunday
Mail”, Sydney “Sun” and “Smith's
Weekly”. During World War II he was
deputy - director of Commonwealth
Government advertising.
Music for Moppets
At the Sydney Symphony Orchestra’s
concert organised by Dean Dixon
for the three to five-year-olds last week
we discovered that at all ages there are
some who love music and
some who can leave it
alone. At the end of a 30-
minute musical melange
that ranged from Bach to
Shostakovitch, the con-
ductor handed out
souvenir booklets.
By this time most of the audience
were beating the daylights out of the
drums and cymbals or swarming over
the brasses and woodwind. But alone
and apart on his diminutive chair, one
child viewed the uproar with no discern-
ible enthusiasm. When the man respon-
sible bowed, smiled and offered him the
souvenir booklet the uncompromising
glowerer set even Dean Dixon aback.
Once more the conductor made tenta-
tive overtures, but the headshake was so
uncompromisingly definite that Mr
Dixon shrugged and passed on to more
receptive moppets.
The unappreciative youngster was in
the minority. Almost all the 120 kinder-
garten pupils obviously considered the
experiment a sheer joy, and were most
vocal about it. The body of the Town
Hall had been cleared of seats and the
orchestra arranged around the children.
Parents and educationists were in the
balconies.
At 11 a.m. the members of the
orchestra moved into the hall, the
females obviously enchanted, the males
a trifle tentative.
While lights glared, cameras whirred
and photographers rushed around, the
kids sat unperturbed as the orchestra
opened with a passage from the Beet-
hoven Ninth played, as Mr Dixon told
them, “softly, louder and very loud”.
Many of the children covered their ears.
Others hung tightly to their chairs. But
by the time the concert was in full swing
most were obviously intrigued by sounds
they were informed came from Bach,
Schubert, Sibelius, Schonberg or Mozart.
A few remained restless, playing pat-a-
cake, seeking out parents aloft, or study-
ing the big organ pipes.
Following the brief but representative
snatches, Dean Dixon introduced the in-
struments separately. The children
reacted to old kindergarten favorites
the triangle and tambourine and were
intrigued by the brasses and timpani.
“Now take your chairs and go and sit
near the instrument you like best” the
conductor told them. After a confused
mixup, not unlike a Sydney crowd cross-
ing a main street, most chose the noisy
sections. Only one exceedingly neat and
scrubbed little girl in school uniform,
moved to the first violins and sat shyly
beside them.
By the time we left, the hall was a
bedlam of kettle drums, snare drums,
cymbals and xylophones.
Patient trombonists
worked their slides while
little boys blew themselves
purple into the mouth-
pieces. Over at the strings
the steadfast little girl had
attracted about half a
dozen others to the more melodic
portion of the orchestra.

117'hile we have no quarrel either with
ABN’s “Four Corners” or with “The
Australian”—whose pleasantly laid out
front page is now a familiar sight on the
nation’s news-stands —we must say that
the space given the latter on the for-
mer’s Saturday, July 25, show was about
the most unabashed plug ever given a
newspaper anywhere. It is true that the
birth of a newspaper is news and we all
sat enthralled while the paper was pro-
duced on our TV screens. In fact it
needed only some hoary old journalist to
announce “That’s newspapers for you.
Off the presses today and wrapped
around the garbage tomorrow,” to have
made it a definite documentary on news-
paper production. However, by the time
we had watched Mr Maxwell Newton
bury his understandably tired head in
his hands and heard Mr Rupert Mur-
doch describe the paper’s policy as
“Liberal with a very small 1” we got the
distinct impression that “Four Corners”
was making an effort on behalf of “The
Australian” above and beyond the call
of duty. An impression which wasn’t
dissipated by the fact that Mr John
Pringle—busily engaged in reorganising,

—got only a scant three minutes on the
same programme. Intelligent and witty,
he was a joy to watch. It was a
thoroughly professional performance to
have got in as much as he did in so
short a time.
Gala Premiere
"C’or a while the best show was defi-
nitely “out front”. We were in-
formed that there had never been half
as many full-length evening dresses and
black and white ties as seen in the foyer
of Her Majesty’s, Brisbane, for the pre-
miere of the Elizabethan’s opera and
ballet season. The opening programme
was Orff's “The Wise Woman” and
Robert Helpmann's ballet, “The Dis-
play”.
And there were no less than three
State Governors Queensland’s Sir
Henry Abel Smith, Tasmania’s Sir
Charles Gairdner and South Australia's
Sir Edric Bastyan.
As news that ABC-TV was photo-
graphing the arrivals hadn’t been widely
publicised we were assured that Brisbane
people hadn’t dressed up only for tele-
vision. The Australian Ballet’s artistic
director, Miss Betty Van Praagh, was
ecstatic. “It’s such an exciting public
reaction,” she said. “Especially for
Brisbane.”
Very Nice Customers
Sydney’s old Imperial Arcade, which
runs between Castlereagh Street and
Pitt Street, in the shopping heartland
of the city, closed down last week for
demolition. Its numerous small kiosks
and Continental dress shops, and the
adjoining Arcadia Hotel, are to make
way for a new and more glorious arcade
that is due to be finished by October,
1965. The builders of the new arcade,
faithful to the sentiments of their pre-
decessors of 1890, will stick to the name
Imperial.
The arcade's tenant of longest stand-
ing, Mr Cecil Cooke, whose hairdressing
saloon is in a gloomy upper gallery of
shops and offices, already mostly empty,
did not seem too perturbed about the
coming destruction when we called on
him last week. “It’s a funny way to
finish,” he said, “but I’m not sorry to
see the place go.” He drew our attention
to the dingy state of the walls and roof
“It’s only been painted once in the 47
years I’ve been here,” he said without
rancor. Mr Cooke told us that in the
old days he always cut the hair of the
arcade's owner, Sir Joynton Smith, who
was also the proprietor of “Smith’s
Weekly”. “A shrewd man,” he said.
Surrounded by their closing-down bar-
gains, most of the arcade’s shopkeepers
had a cheerful, fatalistic air. Several to
whom we spoke seemed to think the
Sydney public would miss the old Im-
perial keenly. “People get such a shock
when they walk through and see the
demolition signs up,” one woman told
us. This warm feeling for the public was
echoed in a handwritten notice we saw
in the window of a lingerie shop:
Over 25 years in this spot. I had very
nice customers, thanks God.”

PLAIN ENGLISH
Woolly Thinking?
/An his propaganda tour of wool-
" growing centres this time last
year, Sir William Gunn was pelted
with flour and eggs by some small-
growers at Hamilton for demanding
—in his plans for the industry
more money for wool promotion
while neglecting a wool marketing
scheme. Obviously, some of the
shots got home. But if the reserve
price scheme he has somewhat
sketchily put up, through the Wool
Board, for consideration by the
Wool Industry Conference in Sep-
tember may seem to satisfy his
assailants, it is quite another matter
whether its implementation will
benefit the industry as a whole and
best serve the national interest. As
a canvass around Hamilton revealed
at the time, the main complaint of
small-growers was that, without a
reserve price, they were at the
mercy of fluctuating prices under
the unfettered auction system. They
were convinced that a floor price
would secure them higher average
returns from their clips. Such a
result would seem to be in the lap
of the gods because, while it could
work this way when wool prices
were weak, the present fluctuations
would still occur when they were
not.
Even for small-growers it would
seem more desirable to rely on a
free market without a reserve price
authority entering the auctions to
put wool into stock, a fact which
could only hang over buyers’ cal-
culations and so limit price rises
which would otherwise ensue from
the normal adjustment of demand
and supply. One has only to look
at the performance of some of the
world’s metals markets under threat
of US stockpile releases, to be wary
of involving wool in this way. It
is all very well to say that the
reserve price schemes for South
African and New Zealand wool
have not had these effects. But
their wool supplies do not figure so
. largely in internationally traded
wool as Australia’s, which, both
overall and in respect of merino
wool, dominate the world market.
One of the overriding questions for
Australia is whether a reserve price
scheme would in fact increase the
average annual wool cheque. It is
more likely that the existence of
surplus stocks from weak price
years, when the Authority had to
buy in wool, would have an adverse
long-term effect on the wool cheque.
And while other commodities are
now playing a bigger role in our
exports we still rely on wool as
the mainstay of our overseas in-
come. What we have lost in poor
price years we have largely made
up when world wool prices have
been high, as they were last year.
Taking a cut through the years the
free marketing system has worked
to our advantage.
It is not even as if a reserve price
scheme would necessarily under-
write price stability in wool (which
in itself would be most desirable,
both from the point of view of
Australia and the wool-consuming
countries) so long as for us prices
were reasonably good and enabled
wool to match synthetic com-
petitors. The best a reserve price
could achieve would be to hold the
line in bad price years, even then
only at the sacrifice of withholding
some of the clip, reducing the wool
cheque in poor years and stifling
increases in good ones in which
surplus stocks would be sold to
supplement normal market supplies.
Thus, unless the authors of the
scheme can show greater advan-
tages than are so far apparent, many
of the big growers, at least, will
shy away from such a costly
scheme with its complications for
growers and scope for Government
dictation to the industry. It is
most likely that either Federal
Government agencies or the Gov-
ernment itself would have to under-
write, and even find, most of the
£6O to £BO million involved in the
scheme based on a reserve price
of 54d., though the Wool Board
is not precise about this aspect
which is left far too much in the
air. True, by accepting a Govern-
ment subsidy for wool promotion,
the wool industry has conceded that,
when it comes to the point, its
traditional reputation for indepen-

Mr Calwell’s ALP
VLThat was Mr Calwell about in
agreeing to nominate on the
Left-wing ticket for the Victorian
ALP State Executive election? Was
it mere opportunism? His unyield-
ing antipathy to the DLP in all its
forms? An attempt to promote the
image of Dr Cairns over that of
Gough Whitlam as his successor?
Was it because he is old and out
of touch with reality? None of
these estimates are very charitable.
How can they be when Mr Calwell
is doing his level best to destroy
the Australian Labor Party as an
effective alternative government?
While much has been said in
criticism of the Victorian ALP
some of it exaggerated the fact
remains it is an extreme Left-
wing party which has quite as
much as anything in the long cata-
logue of Labor’s ills kept the
Party from even getting within
walking distance of winning a
Federal election. It is now a moot
point whether, under Mr Calwell’s
leadership, the Australian Labor
Party can ever win a Federal
election—or deserves to. At a time
when the Victorian moderates
looked like having their first
chance in years of ousting the
extremists from the Victorian ALP,
only Mr Calwell could have inter-
vened with such delicacy and
timing—to prevent a badlv-needed
reform.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE ALP
When History Judges
Mr Calwell
The split becomes a chasm
ARTHUR CALWELL
Dubious place in history
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
QJome Labor members believe that Mr
Calwell’s decision to stand for the
Victorian ALP Executive at the invita-
tion of the Left-wing pro-unity ticket
Victorian Executive reveals his sub-
conscious thinking. He wants to be
justified by history. But the only way
history will justify him is if Labor
under his ultimate successor does even
more disastrously than Labor has done
with him as Federal Labor leader.
So he goes on doing things and taking
attitudes that, as far as is humanly pos-
sible, will ensure that Labor will do
worse than it is doing even after he
has departed from the political scene.
This theory might at first glance seem
far-fetched. But it is plausible, and does
explain some of the extraordinary con-
tradictions in Mr Calwell’s attitude. He
obviously does not want to join the
Federal ALP Executive, which decides
the ALP’s national policy. Though his
deputy, Mr Whitlam, had come out with
a clear-cut plan for the reformation of
Labor’s Federal machine, under which
both the Federal parliamentary leader
and his deputy would become members
with full voting rights of this most august
and significant of ALP bodies, Mr Cal-
well did not raise his voice in support
of the proposal at the NSW ALP con-
ference in June. The NSW conference
endorsed the proposal, but it did so with-
out any prompting or lead from
Mr Calwell.
This conforms with his attitude when
Mr Stewart (Lab., NSW) raised in the
Federal Parliamentary caucus a similar
proposal. Mr Stewart wanted Mr Cal-
well and Mr Whitlam given a status
which would prevent a repetition of the
occasion when the two men waited under
a street lamp outside the Hotel Kensing-
ton, Canberra, while inside the 36 vir-
tually-unknown delegates to the ALP
conference decided, by 19 votes to 17,
ALP policy on the establishment of the
United States radio - communications
centre at Exmouth Gulf in Western Aus-
tralia.
Mr Calwell, as party chairman, stalled
on discussion of the status of the parlia-
mentary leaders while pleading with Mr
Stewart to withdraw his motion. Mr
Stewart refused to withdraw. When a
vote was taken he had only a handful
of supporters. Mr Calwell was not
among them. He had voted, in effect,
for the perpetuation of the system that
relegated him to the role of a highly-
publicised but politically impotent office
boy. Interestingly, Whitlam, trapped by
his loyalty to Mr Calwell as leader, also
voted against the Stewart motion a
vote that he probably now bitterly
regrets and would not repeat.
But while not prepared to accept the
responsibility of participating in ALP
national policy-making, Mr Calwell was
prepared to accept the responsibility of
trying to preserve the Victorian ALP
conference, whose tolerance of associa-
tion with Communism and Communists
probably had done more than any other
factor to keep Labor out of power since
the split of 1954.
When Mr Calwell agreed to put his
name on the Victorian Executive ticket
for election he was doing everything
within his power to help the present con-
trollers of the Victorian ALP stay in
office. Even in selecting Mr Cairns (Lab.,
Vic.) as his running mate thereby
revealing very clearly that he was pre-
pared to push hard the thought he has
already expressed to Labor parliamentar-
ians that Mr Cairns should be either
the next Labor leader or his deputy
there seems to be confirmation of the
subconscious theory.
His hatred of the Democratic Labor
Party is dedicated and intense. But it is
difficult to see how even this hatred
could blind him to the knowledge that
the Australian public electorally will not
accept toleration of Communism. Elec-
tions from 1954 onwards have shown
this.
Mr Cairns makes no secret of his
tolerance of Communism within Aus-
tralia. In one of his lectures, when dis-
cussing power and its points of con-
centration in the twentieth-century capi-
talist society, Cairns said: “For the
socialist, absolute (authoritarian) Left-
wing movements are not a power prob-
lem. The Communist Party and its front
organisations . . . having so little power
that they are not in any way part of the
power structure.”
In his Curtin Memorial lecture on
“Socialist Liberty” at the University of
TWENTY LASHES
80 Years Ago: August 2, 1884
At the rear of the Yass Court-
house, on the Bth July, 1884,
a scene occurred for which no
parallel can be found in the recent
annals of States claiming a place
among civilised communities. Some
days before, SAMUEL LILLYCROP,
a half-witted chimney-sweep with
the poor sense apportioned to him
on his start in life deadened or
destroyed by the poisonous abomina-
tions the sale of which enables black-
coated, fair-spoken citizens to keep
liveried servants and showy suburban
residences was being baited by
larrikins. The latter marked their
quarry, knew his shortcomings, and,
resolving that such an opportunity for
enjoyment should not be lost, amused
themselves by goading the insensate
creature to madness. Mark the sequel.
Two policemen broke through the
jeering canaille, seized the tipsy
imbecile, and, after the manner of
their tribe, induced him to accom-
pany them to the lock-up, followed
by a ribald mob. On the way their
prisoner, who was about as re-
sponsible for his words as an occupant
of Gladesville, used blasphemous and
bawdy language. A few days after-
wards his shrieks were heard over
Yass, as, securely tied to a ladder
behind the Court-house, he received
twenty lashes. The people gathered
in the street to listen to the angry
swish of the “cat” through the air,
the dull squash of the knotted thongs
on the sweep’s back, and the yell of
the half-idiotic victim as the skin
was being dexterously filliped off his
shoulders.


Western Australia in June, 1960, Mr
Cairns said that support for Communism
would “in many ways lead towards
economic and social progress.” In the
same lecture he said: “It (Communism)
will not and cannot be a threat to the
status quo unless the level of economic
and social discontent is high. In a coun-
try like Australia, where it is most dif-
ficult to change the government, there
is little chance that the State will be
overthrown . . . provided that Australia
maintains foreign and defence policies
consistent with security, which is not the
case today, and maintains a satisfactory
rate of social progress, Communism will
not represent a threat.” This is an
acceptance of Communism as a reform-
ing stimulant rather than as a world
threat.
If the present political climate con-
tinues —and there is nothing to suggest
any immediate change as far as the Aus-
tralian attitude towards Communism is
concerned Mr Cairns could be a more
disastrous Federal Labor leader than Mr
Calwell, and history would then prob-
ably treat Mr Calwell less harshly in
its judgment.
As I see it, it is unlikely that the
Federal Parliamentary Labor Party will
do anything about Mr Calwell’s action
in seeking to bolster an ALP regime that
has brought Labor nothing but disaster
electorally. The party is punch drunk.
It has been hit so often that an extra
blow does not produce a reaction. It
has been punched into insensitivity. The
personalities capable of fighting are no
longer there.
Mr Whitlam is abroad studying and
widening his experience, though if he
had stayed at home his experience would
have been widened more than he bar-
gained for. The older one-time leaders
are ineffective and without energy. No-
body any longer takes any notice of, or
cares about, what the Federal Parlia-
mentary Labor Party thinks or does.
The fight is for and within the ALP
machine.
To that extent Mr Calwell may be
described as realistic in getting into a
party dispute about a machine job. But
his friends and former admirers un-
doubtedly would have preferred him to
be fighting for, say, the parliamentary
party in the formulation of ALP national
policy rather than for the preservation
of an executive that, with its tolerance
of Communism and Communist associa-
tions, has reduced the party to a pathetic
state electorally.
STUDENTS
The Wizards of “Oz”
STuirtitig with Juvenal
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
ALAN STOUT
“Gas Lash ..."
Pnough academic and artistic talent
to fill several magazines and stock
half a dozen television panels was on
show at Sydney's Central Court last
week in the “Tharunka” case.
Police charged four students with
publishing an obscene publication on
February 17. The students are Michael
William Robertson, of Epping; Alexan-
der Popov, of Warrawee; Martin Ritchie
Sharp (author of the article), of Belle-
vue Hill; and Peter Morgan Conyng-
ham, of Campsie. The honorary mana-
ging director of Anglican Press (Mr
Francis James) was charged with print-
ing an obscene publication. All pleaded
not guilty. The magistrate, Mr Gibson,
SM, reserved his decision until August
12.
Witnesses for the defence included
Professor A. K. Stout, Professor of
Philosophy at Sydney University; Mr
John Ellard, a psychiatrist; Professor
Reginald Martin, of the School of Cli-
nical Psychology at the University of
NSW; English lecturers Mr Ernest Cole-
man and Mr Geoffrey Little; Miss Betty
Archdale, the headmistress of Abbots-
leigh School; the warden of St Paul’s
College, the Rev. Alex Bennie; author
Mr Mungo MacCallum; artists Mr John
Olsen and Mr Elwyn Lynn and The
Bulletin cartoonist and art director,
Mr Leslie Tanner.
“The Gas Lash” is a young man’s first-
person story of how he takes a young
girl to a party, gets her drunk to seduce
her, has success in sight, when she
chucks “all over me tux! . . .”
Professor Stout said: “At the first
reading you are just shocked —at the
second reading you are shocked at what
you ought to be shocked at.” Professor
Stout said that the moral content of the
article was good because it was an attack
on an evil way of life in a peculiarly
dramatic manner. “I would say its
moral intent was to warn women off
and suggest to men ‘This is not the kind
of life for me’,” he said. Professor Stout
said that the use of the phrase “animal
act” was “particularly effective”.
Mr Mungo MacCallum said that “The
Gas Lash” was a traditional form of
illustrated satire, “dating back thousands
of years, starting with Juvenal”.
Mr John Olsen said the article was
“quite good for a man as young as
Sharp” and “highly sophisticated and
skilfully drawn”.
Miss Betty Archdale said she thought
the article would arouse “a certain
amount of disgust and a certain amount
of boredom among students”.
Mr Wran (for the four students): Do
you think it would tend to corrupt?
Miss Archdale: No—not a scrap.
Mr Wran: Do you think it would do
any good?
Miss Archdale: I would think it would
have no effect.
Sergeant Ellis (police prosecutor): No
effect of any real value?
Miss Archdale: No effect, either
beneficial or injurious.
Meanwhile Victoria’s undercover
book-banning system has swung into
operation again. This time the victim
is the Sydney satirical magazine “Oz”.
Last week newsagents had still not re-
ceived copies of the July issue which
has Mona Lisa in a to, less dress on its
cover. Spokesmen for the distributors,
Collins Book Depot Limited, said that
“supplies have not been received from
Sydney”.
However, it is known that the Vic-
torian Vice Squad has interested itself
in this and earlier issues of “Oz”.
One Melbourne outlet had its copies of
an earlier issue seized with the usual
minimum of publicity. As far as the
July issue is concerned, editor Richard
Neville claims that Collins rang him in
Sydney and said they were not prepared
to distribute the July issue.
Nevertheless, many Melbourne people
have been able to read the July issue.
Editor Neville flew to Melbourne a fort-
night ago and sold his magazine in the
grounds of Monash and Melbourne
Universities. He said he cleared 1700
copies with the aid of a helper during
the course of a single day. Neville
commented, “It is curious that this
seizure has resulted in the general pub-
lic being unable to buy the magazine,
while students, impressionable young
minds, have bought them up in large
numbers”.

OIL
Where the Good Oil
Starts to Flow
“We’re all feeling very good about this. .."
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
barrow ISLAND
A new strike
IrTo the question whether commercial
•1 oilfields underlie Wapet’s two
recently successful wells in Western Aus-
tralia, the answer is probably “yes”. But
it is going to take a longish time to be
(certain about it. How long? After talking
with the company’s experts at the well
kites on Barrow Island and Yardarino
last week one concluded it would be well
[into next year.
Naturally, after drilling more than 90
dry holes in a row across a thousand
/or more mile stretch abutting the west-
jern seaboard in the last 11 years, since
I its flash-in-the-pan oil strike at Rough
'Range, Wapet is not counting too many
[chickens in public anyway. But, as
tformer US atomic scientist Dr Robert
(Sheriff, Wapet's geophysical supervisor,
put it on the Barrow Island drilling site:
“Of course, if we were very discreet we
wouldn’t say anything but we’re all
feeling very good about this.”
! Sheriff explained later that the follow-
lup would be complicated because of
(geophysical problems. The difficulty of
(getting geophysical information would
[probably mean the field would have to
be proved by random drilling. It might
be easier, but not much, to get such
information about the offshore areas
(when marine seismic work could be lined
| up. This might have to wait until next
year, but, before that, further wells are
most likely to be drilled on the island
itself, where Wapet is also looking im-
patiently across a narrow stretch of sea
to its permit areas on the still-radioactive
Monte Bello Islands.
I Jn the meantime, the company knows its
i rig on Barrow Island is astride an oil
[sands section of about 140 feet, of which
about 40 feet is considered too tight to
, give a natural oil flow. The flow to date
1 has been at the rate of 725 barrels of oil
fa day. This is well below the best
(original flow rates at Moonie, where one
[ w ell (from two levels) flowed at about
\2500 barrels a day. But at least the oil
section in the Barrow Island well is
thicker than Moonie and the drill is now
going deeper to explore lower structures
Much, in turn, could well reveal addi-
tional oil sands.
Having produced flow oil, the Barrow
Island well has captured the imagination
more strongly than the Yardarino find
some 700 miles to the South a pleas-
ant 50-mile drive out of Geraldton into
some of Australia’s best wheat country.
But here, also, one found the explorers
highly confident. For instance, Ted
Kempin, an Australian who has been
with Wapet for 12 years and is now its
supervising drilling engineer, told me he
thought Yardarino could be better than
Moonie.
Admittedly, Kempin said, oil didn’t
actually flow to the surface from Yar-
darino No. 1, but 400 gallons of it were
found in the drill pipe after drilling
operations were completed. In his view,
the drill only tapped a narrow section
of the oil sands. It had already pene-
trated a huge cap of gas which flowed
at a rate of around 13-15 million cubic
feet a day, about equal to the highest
so far from an Australian mainland well
(15 million cubic ft. a day flowed from
the Associated Group’s Rolleston No. 1
well in Queensland in February this
year).
Confirmation of a commercial oilfield
could come more quickly from Yardarino
than Barrow Island. The second Yarda-
rino well, now going down, is designed to
delineate the top of this so-called “bald-
headed” structure and then to probe to
still deeper levels, as in the case of
Barrow Island No. 1. Depending on the
result of this well —which may well strike
only gas at the upper levels—before pro-
ceeding to explore deeper ones a third
hole is likely to be drilled, probably
south of No. 1 well, to test the oil sands
already encountered. At least five wells
are envisaged to get a general evaluation
of the Yardarino structure’s commercial
possibilities, but this will be a much
easier and more rapid operation than
drilling an equivalent number at the
more distant and isolated Barrow Island.
FOOTBALL
The Flick and the Stiff Arm
Trouble in two codes
FROM “DISCUS” IN SYDNEY
fFwo of the football codes has had
A its troubles this season; the Austra-
lian League with an interstate contro-
versy over the “flick” pass, and Rugby
League with its French tour failure and
its increase in stiff-arm tackles which
will sooner or later break someone’s
neck.
The Australian code's flick pass is a
variation on the handball which has
always been an attractive feature of the
game. Instead of holding the ball on
either palm and biffing it, the new trend
is towards a one-handed pass, often
over the head. The Victorians use it
a lot, the West Australians decry it, but
used it in their recent victory over South
Australia. The Westerners claimed they
were “flicked to death” against Victoria
in Melbourne and were not going to
lose another match while lashed to their
guns. Unless the National Football
Council can outlaw it, the flick pass
seems here to stay, a major change in
the Australian game.
Rugby League has had to survive a
drab tour by France, although the
French team was not as bad as the
record suggests. Rather, I think, Aus-
tralian Rugby League has an unusual
depth of young talent, and some of us
wish the season could end with an
Australia versus The Rest match to
allow us to see how really good some
of it is. The only catch is that there is
not another centre around to equal Lisle.
The Rest would have two men, in
Arch Brown and Les Johns, who made
the season for me with two remarkable
flashes of individual play, Brown with
a beautiful intercept and try, and Johns
with a movement that took him from
his backline to within a few yards of
scoring, and included a 50-yard dash, a
kick-on, and a follow-up to gather in
the ball and almost score. You don’t
see that often in these days of teams
like well-oiled machines.
In Rugby League it is permissible for
a man running with the ball to ward off
tackles with a stiff-arm “don’t argue”.
But when a man running full tilt runs
into a stiff arm, that’s the stiff-arm
tackle, and its use is increasing, although
it is illegal. It is much more deadly
than the heated punch which is more
obvious to referees, and causes most
of the “sent off” incidents.

When the ALP
Missed the Bus
A victory for Ted Hill
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
C. FITZGIBBON
Failure to organise
The recently concluded national and
branch elections in the Waterside
Workers’ Union, for which it had been
hoped that the General Secretary,
M. C. Fitzgibbon, would organise an ALP
ticket, have left the Communists in very
effective control. The tragedy is that
the results show that had an ALP ticket
been organised it would have stood an
excellent chance of success.
As stated in The Bulletin (18/4/64),
Fitzgibbon’s attitude of non-interference
seemed certain to ensure the return of
the three Communist Federal officials,
Messrs Roach, Docker and Wallington.
It did.
In Brisbane, CP member A. Graham
won the key position of full-time branch
organiser. The status quo was main-
tained in Sydney, where all full-time
branch (CP-controlled) officials were
unopposed. As well as this, Sydney
secretary T. Nelson (CP) won the vacant
position on the Federal Council; so the
union’s policy-making body will still be
dominated by Communists and extreme
Left-wingers.
It was in Melbourne that there un-
folded the tale of what-might-have-been.
Campaigning on a purely Labor plat-
form for the post of president was a
moderate ALP man, L. Stuart, who
was attacked by both Communists and
Victorian extremists of his own party.
Stuart defeated unity ticket man E.
McCormick and also won a position as
Trades Hall delegate. Whether the
lesson in Stuart’s victory will be heeded
remains to be seen. On past perfor-
mances it is unlikely that it will be.
While the Communists had cause to
be jubilant on the overall results, Ted
Hill's breakaway CPA (Marxist-Lenin-
ist), standing only three candidates, gave
them their worst mauling in years. In
a contest for the newly created Victorian
position of Assistant Secretary/Organiser,
which the CP confidently expected its
candidate, E. McCool, to win, Hillite
Ted Bull swept in with a four-to-one
majority. Rubbing in the salt even
further was L. Hillier, who won the
full-time position of Vigilant Officer.
Hillier was the centre of a recent con-
troversial dispute on the Melbourne
waterfront which resulted in his sus-
pension from the industry, which in turn
led to the claim that he had been
“dumped” by the WWF because of his
membership of Hill’s party.
No less disconcerting to the CP was
the performance of the leader of the
Hill group in Sydney, Sid Clare. Lack-
ing the resources of his Melbourne com-
rades, Clare made a trial run for one of
the honorary positions of vice-president.
He was defeated, but at last counting
had run up the astonishing total of 1500
votes.
To be seen in its true perspective it
must be realised that the CP is more
highly organised on the Sydney water-
front than anywhere else in Australia
(excepting the Seamen’s Union). A CP-
backed candidate in Sydney is accepted
as unbeatable, and Clare netted 1500
votes!
ABORIGINES
Freedom Riders
Buses for students ...
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
ThiE suggestion that Sydney students
might focus attention on the con-
dition of Australia’s Aborigines by
emulating the American “freedom riders”
(The Bulletin 11/7/64) has caught
on. Now a co-ordinating committee has
been set up to discuss details and plan
its extension to other cities.
The Sydney committee is catholic in
composition. Headed by an Aborigine
who is himself being helped by the
students’ “Abschol” scheme, it has a
secretary from the ALP Club and a
treasurer from the Liberal Club. Repre-
sented also are the Humanist Club, the
Labor Club and the Jewish Students’
Union, while staffs from the Universities
of Sydney and New South Wales have
attended meetings. The committee plans
to keep its membership open to all
student associations, but is wary of the
political parties. This is to be an all-
student show.
It believes that discrimination in
Australia is more often the fruit of apathy
and paternalism than of positive hosti-
lity. But the glare of world publicity
would have a salutary effect. So present
plans are for buses full of students and
sympathetic staff members to leave
Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth
simultaneously, and head for their
State’s problem towns. They would
travel for about three weeks, living with
the local Aborigines, testing discrimina-
tory practices by joint action. If their
plans succeed, the “freedom riders”
could be big news.
TAB
An Answer of
22 Questions
Their case was unsound
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
/\dds much longer than a punter can
” get from them on a racecourse are
offered by Tasmanian bookmakers
against the introduction of an off-course
totalisator in the State. The bookmakers
appear to be on a good thing. They know
the Labor politicians.
Racing and trotting clubs have
strenuously supported the off-course tote
as the only thing which will save therft
from extinction. Stakes are trailing far
behind rising costs, fewer horses are
being kept in training and the clubs are
losing money.
For several years club officials, aided
by men from the Victorian TAB, have
gathered evidence to support introduc-
tion of the off-course tote. The first
case they presented to the Government
was described by the Premier, Mr Reece,
as inadequate, as indeed it was; but a
much more comprehensive and com-
pelling case was handed to Mr Reece in
April last year.
In September Mr Reece finally answer-
ed the impatient clubs. His answer con-
sisted of 22 questions, to which the
officials painstakingly replied. They
finally got a response in March of this
year, when the Racing Commissioner,
Mr A. R. Neilson, announced that their
case was unsound. The Government, not
unaware of opposition to the tote expres-
sed at the ALP State Conference, grate-
fully accepted Neilson’s advice.
Mr Reece also rejected a counter-pro-
posal by bookmakers that they should
contribute £lO,OOO annually to the clubs
and continue their off-course betting.
The Liberal Party pledged itself to
introduce the off-course tote, but some
of its members have been having second
thoughts since the big Labor victory on
May 2.


New York Newsletter
“Killers, Murderers and
Murphy’s Rats”
Goldwater’s wonderful windfall in Harlem?
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
Three incidents stand out in the rush
of events which led up to the
disaster which has struck this city,
brought death and destruction to its
Negro ghettos in night after night of
street rioting and terror, and whose
duration and ultimate toll no one can
foresee or assess.
Incident Number One, Thursday
morning, July 16. The day was sultry
and steaming hot. The “long hot sum-
mer” all had been dreading, for personal
and political reasons, was at its peak of
discomfort. Forebodings of trouble
were all around, in the newspapers, in
people’s conversations, in their thoughts.
At 20 minutes past nine a 15-year-
old Negro boy named James Powell, a
student attending summer sessions in a
junior high school in the Yorkville
section, was shot twice by a police lieu-
tenant wearing civilian clothes and died
in the gutter on East 76th Street, op-
posite the school. The lieutenant,
Thomas Gilligan, who had been cited
many times for heroism in 13 years of
service, reported officially that he had
acted in self-defence, shooting the youth
in the hand and abdomen as he ap-
proached with a drawn knife.
News of the killing spread quickly
through nearby Harlem, where the cry
of “police brutality” had been raised
repeatedly in the increasing clashes be-
tween white policemen and the Negro
and Puerto Rican residents. An angry
crowd of 300 Negroes quickly gathered
at the scene of the shooting but were
dispersed by an emergency force of 75
steel-helmeted police.
Incident Number Two, Thursday
evening, July 16. In his acceptance
speech at the Cow Palace in San Fran-
cisco newly-nominated Presidential can-
didate Barry Goldwater stirred the Re-
publican delegates to applause with these
words:
“Tonight there is violence in our
streets . . . the growing menace in our
country tonight, to personal safety, to
life, to limb and property, in homes, in
churches, on the playgrounds and places
of business, particularly in our great
cities, is the mounting concern, or should
be, of every thoughtful citizen in the
United States.
“Security from domestic violence, no
less than from foreign aggression, is
the most elementary and fundamental
purpose of any government. And a
government that cannot fulfil this pur-
pose is one that cannot long command
the loyalty of its citizens.
“History shows us that nothing pre-
pares the way for tyranny more than
the failure of public officials to keep the
streets safe from bullies and marau-
ders.”
Many of his listeners wondered at
Goldwater’s emphasis on the preserva-
tion of peace in the streets, normally the
responsibility of local, not the Federal,
Government. The motivation behind his
remarks was to be made clear all too
soon.
Incident Number Three, Saturday
night, July 18. The heat of day had
carried over into evening and the streets
of Harlem were filled with crowds un-
able to bear their stifling tenement
rooms. On the corner of 125th Street
and Seventh Avenue, one of the prin-
cipal intersections of the black ghetto,
a rally sponsored by the Congress of
Racial Equality, the Negro action group
known familiarly as CORE, got under
way with a handful of spectators in
attendance. The rally had been planned
originally to protest against events in
Mississippi, including the disappearance
of three Civil Rights workers who are
supposed dead.
But the theme of the meeting quickly
changed. The first speaker, a 17-year-
old girl, said: “James Powell was shot
because he was black.” The crowd
murmured assent. More people gather-
ed round. “We got a Civil Rights Bill,”
the girl shouted, “and along with the
Civil Rights Bill we got Barry Goldwater
and a dead black boy.”
The crowd continued to grow. They
yelled approval as another speaker said:
“Forty-five per cent of the cops in
New York are neurotic murderers.”
The rally reached its climax when
the Rev. Nelson Dukes called for “ac-
tion, not talk,” and led a march to the
nearest police station, four blocks away,
to demand the suspension of Lieutenant
Gilligan.
At the precinct headquarters the
Negroes taunted police with shouts of
“killers, murderers, Murphy’s rats”.
Michael Murphy is the police com-
missioner.
At 9.20 p.m., as darkness came, police
set up grey-painted portable barricades
to keep the crowd back from the station
house. The Negroes resisted and a
scuffle broke out the opening burst
of violence that roared into a night-
mare of rioting, looting and shooting
continuing through the long night of
Saturday; subsiding by day, and recurring
every night since.
When the sun rose over the rubble-
strewn Harlem streets on Sunday morn-
ing, Mr Dukes stood in front of the
shattered glass window of a looted clo-
thing store on 125th Street and shook
his head. “This has got out of hand,” he
said. “If I knew this was going to hap-
pen I wouldn’t have said anything.”

heavily on the Reverend Dukes’ con-
science, but the conflagration was inevit-
able. In light of the ever-growing ten-
sions and pressures in the three-and-a-
half square miles of Harlem, where more
than a quarter of a million men, women
and children lead lives of squalor and
poverty unimaginable to the white sub-
urbanites who are carried through the
area twice daily on their Westchester
commuting trains.
A few statistics, cold as they are, point
up the “despair, hopelessness and futil-
ity” of the black man's life in Harlem.
The juvenile delinquency rate is double
that in the rest of the city and is increas-
ing at double the rate elsewhere. Harlem
has ten times as many dope addicts, six
times as many victims of venereal disease
and six times as many murderers as the
Bronx or Manhattan or the other
boroughs.
Forty per cent of the housing units
are in so-called “old law” tenement build-
ings, considered inadequate for human
habitation, and 11 per cent are in dila-
pidated buildings actually unsafe. Family
life is appalling: illegitimacy is rife and
broken homes the norm. Education is
for the minority. “Schools have lost
faith in the ability of their pupils to
learn and the community has lost faith
in the ability of the schools to
teach,” according to a recent report by
HARYOU, (Harlem Youth Opportun-
ities Unlimited).
Legislation fails
TTnemployment is from three to four
times higher in Harlem. Traditionally
the Negro is “last to be hired, first to
be fired.” Even the imposition of strict
anti-discrimination legislation by New
York State has failed to alter material-
ly Negro job opportunities. Lack of
education is a controlling factor in keep-
ing the Negro at the lowest rung of the
ladder.
The passage of the Civil Rights Bill
in Washington this summer, one hun-
dred years after Lincoln's emancipation
proclamation, has served to emphasise
the Harlem-dweller’s plight rather than
inspire him with hope of future bles-
sings.
For more than a year Civil Rights
groups in Harlem have been agitating,
demonstrating and picketing against trade
unions which deny the Negro admis-
sion, in violation of the law. So far, they
have made little if any progress. They
have been demanding an end to slum
housing, and they engineered a rent
strike against gouging landlords, which
was approved by Mayor Wagner. The
slum tenements are still there, and the
occupants are paying three to four times
the proper rental for the privilege of
living in one-third to one-fourth the

Portents of the approaching storm in
Harlem, like flashes of lightning in the
summer night, have been appearing for
a long time. In March of this year
David Watts, a white church worker,
was fatally stabbed. A few weeks later
Eileen Johnson, a white Welfare Depart-
ment social worker, was stabbed as she
left a Harlem night club. Shortly after-
wards Mrs Margit Sugar, a white clo-
thing store owner, was fatally stabbed in
the heart by a teenage Harlem youth and
her husband was stabbed six times by
the same attacker.
The situation was ripe for the growth
and expansion of extremist hate groups
of both the Right Malcolm X and his
Nationalist Muslim Movement, and of
the Left Jesse Gray and his Commun-
ity Council for Housing. No less than
17 black supremacy groups have bur-
geoned in recent months. No one knows
the extent of Communist infiltration in
these, and President Johnson has sent
the FBI into Harlem to find out.
The “White Backlash”
HPhe long pent-up explosion could not
have come at a more fortuitous mo-
ment for Senator Barry Goldwater's poli-
tical fortunes if he had planned its timing.
It points up vividly the tremendous
forces behind the “White Backlash”,
which constitutes the x factor in the
forthcoming Presidential election and
possibly could mean the difference be-
tween defeat and victory for the man
who voted against the Civil Rights bill.
Even more fortuitous for Goldwater
and possibly this was a planned
stroke was the withdrawal of Ala-
bama Governor Wallace from the Pre-
sidential race on the Democratic side.
Wallace, wiio scored surprisingly well in
primary races in the northern States of
Maryland and Wisconsin, is a violent
racist who commands a huge following
in the south. If Wallace had decided to
run for the Presidency on a third-party
ticket he would have drawn many votes
away from Goldwater. His departure
from the national political picture leaves
Goldwater as the recipient of the hard-
core racist vote.
There is more than a suspicion that
Wallace's withdrawal w'as dictated by
his financial supporters, the likes of
H. L. Hunt and similar Texas oilion-
aires, who now feel that Goldwater has a
real chance to capture the White House.
In other days the financial oligarchs of
Wall Street dictated the tune to which
Presidential candidates of the Republican
Party danced. In these days of piping
prosperity there is more than enough
money in Texas and California and
Oklahoma to finance a Presidential cam-
paign.

“Crush Malaysia” From Within?
Traitors in high places ...
FROM DENNIS BLOODWORTH IN SINGAPORE
There was a pause between two acts
of sudden violence, and a weak
sunset illuminated the scene: at
the corner the armored cars prudishly
concealed under the shade trees, the
men of the Singapore Regiment with
fixed bayonets beside the barbed-wire
road blocks, and then the long, empty
street with its glittering carpet of shat-
tered bottles, the knots of sullen youths
under the shadow of the arcaded side-
walks, the quietly burning car. The
knives and machetes had been out. They
had gouged a man’s eyes out and then
disembowelled him. The heavy, humid
air seemed to sweat hatred and fear.
These have been the worst race riots
in this island since the war. In the first
60 hours 19 Chinese and Malays were
murdered in the streets and kampongs
of the multi-racial city, more than 450
were injured and 1500 arrested. The
strict curfew was lifted only for a few
hours out of every 24 to let people buy
food from the rapidly exhausted shops.
Night in the critical district of Geylang
was punctuated by screams and the
alarm beat of the mosque drums, while
white, Sikh, Chinese and Malay officers
of a mixed Singapore battalion led
their men through kampongs of wrecked
or half-burned wooden shacks to restore
order.
But there were other scenes. I saw
Malay and Chinese children playing to-
gether amicably in a courtyard. In a
large block of nearby flats the Chinese
approached their Malay neighbors say-
ing, “We know each other, we are all
friends. Do not let us get mixed up in
this.” In the kampong near my house
some Chinese helped to carry the be-
longings of a frightened Malay family
that wanted to move out. Most people
of all races have been terrified by an
explosion of racial wrath detonated by
secret-society thugs and hooligans, many
of whom have now been put under pre-
cautionary detention.
Tun Abdul Razak, acting Prime
Minister of Malaysia, has declared that
the trouble started because a “mischief-
maker threw a bottle” at the Muslim
procession that celebrated Mohammed’s
birthday in Singapore on July 21. But
the color of the man who struck the
match is unimportant. The crucial
question is: who turned on the gas that
produced the inflammable atmosphere
for this explosion?
The mainland of Malaya and the
whole Federation of Malaysia are ruled
by the Malayan Alliance, a coalition of
Malay, Chinese and Indian political
parties dominated by the United Malays
National Organisation (UMNO) of
Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.
But the constituent state of Singapore
is governed by the predominantly Chin-
ese Peoples’ Action Party of Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The PAPS’
success in winning over the Singapore
Malays from UMNO in addition to its
Chinese following, and its recent efforts
to contest seats on the mainland of
Malaya itself, have aroused bitter resent-
ment in the ranks of UMNO, many of
whose senior officials accuse Lee Kuan
Yew of wanting the PAP to supersede
the Alliance and of ambitions to become
the first Chinese Premier of Malaysia.
Since March, “Utusan Melayu”, the
established organ of UMNO, has attack-
ed Mr Lee and his Government in an
attempt to discredit them in Malaysia.
It has accused Lee of heartless discrimi-
nation against the 240,000 Malays in
Singapore, of evicting many of them
ruthlessly from their homes to make
room for modern housing development
projects, and of neglecting to ensure that
they have adequate educational facili-
ties, a quota of official jobs, and suffici-
ent reserved land on which to live.
The PAP has found that refutation of
these charges has produced further de-

mands. Reminded, for example, that
Malays had free education up to and
including technical university level,
“Utusan” articles demanded free school-
books and free transport to and from
school. The more easygoing Malays,
who prefer the equatorial pace of kam-
pong life in attap huts, undoubtedly
suffer hardship amid the flat-and-factory
progress welcomed by the bustling Chin-
ese. The PAP contend, however, that
there must be a limit to the extent that
one race is given artificial aids so that
it can keep up with another in this poly-
glot society. It is not possible, for ex-
ample, to charge Malays cheaper rents
than Chinese when they live in the same
block of flats, as some claim.
Lee, therefore, proposed a meeting
with Malay community leaders to dis-
cuss their problems. But Dato Syed
Jaafar Albar, the UMNO Secretary-
General, called a Malay and Muslim
Convention one week earlier at which
those who wanted to accept Lee’s invita-
tion were branded “traitors” in advance.
On Albar’s invitation, delegates from
two Malay Opposition parties (officially
accused of active sympathies for Presi-
dent Soekarno’s anti-Malaysia campaign)
attended the Convention and a “National
Action Committee” was formed which
included at least one Opposition dele-
gate denounced by the then Central
Government in a white paper as a “close
Indonesian agent”. A list of stiff
demands for special privileges for the
Malays was approved.
the eve of Mohammed’s birthday
” I found a Malay language tract in
downtown Singapore headed “Malay
National Action Committee”, which in
part read, “We urge the Malays who
have supported the PAPS to come back
to their own people and fight shoulder
to shoulder with them. Because the
PAP is a Chinese government which is
trying to victimise the Malays ... if
the Malays do not resist now, there will
be no Malays left after 20 years . . .
let us fight the PAP Government before
it is too late.” Twenty-four hours later
rioting broke out between Malays and
Chinese.
Many observers believe that if Malay-
sian solidarity is not to be shattered, the
Tunku must act firmly against racial
agitators when he returns to Malaysia,
however prominent they prove to be.
Things are bad enough with Con-
frontation without adding internal race
conflict to the problem.
If President Soekarno of Indonesia
is allowed to continue his terrorist
campaign against the Commonwealth
Federation of Malaysia, Indonesian
guerrillas and armed insurgents of the
Malayan Communist Party may set up
a “liberated zone” on the mainland of
Malaya early next year, experts believe.
For while trained irregulars, stiffened
with Indonesian Army units, are launch-
ing raids across the borders of the
Malaysian States of Sarawak and Sabah
in North Borneo, intelligence has un-
covered a conspiracy 800 miles away
at the other end of the country.
It took 12 years, 23 battalions of
regular troops and a vast para-military
police organisation to defeat some 10,000
Communist terrorists who took to the
Malayan jungles in 1948. But a pre-
dominantly Chinese group of about 500
hard-core terrorists withdrew across the
border into the rain forests of Southern
Thailand when their revolt was finally
smashed, and last December these re-
ceived clearance from Peking to co-
operate with the Indonesians in their
“crush Malaysia” campaign.
They have won over disgruntled
Muslims of South Thailand by promising
that their provinces will be wrenched
from the control of Buddhist Bangkok
and joined to the largely Muslim Malay
Peninsula, once the present Malaysian
Government of Tunku Abdul Rahman
in Kuala Lumpur has been overthrown.
Since the Malays in South Thailand are
related to those in North Malaya, sub-
version has seeped back over the
frontier, notably into the North Malayan
State of Kelantan.
Kelantan is the political stronghold
of the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party, a
legal opposition group some of whose
members are nevertheless known to be
ready to help Indonesian saboteurs and
agents if they land. For the first time,
therefore, the armed cadres of the MCP
have been able to build a network of
active sympathisers to supply them,
hide them, warn them of danger and
act as couriers among not only the
Chinese, but also the Malays. Moreover,
about 90,000 of a total population of
7,000,000 on the Malayan mainland are
first or second generation Indonesians.
Meanwhile, several dozen tough Left-
wing Chinese (as well as Malay volun-
teers) have been smuggled by secret
routes across the narrow Straits of
Malacca to small camps in Indonesia,
where they are trained in sabotage and
armed uprising, in preparation for their
return to Malaya as terrorist leaders.

The Future for Wool
" We have not introduced a plan to have it thrown out"
By JOHN ANDREW
One of the popular Australian myths
is that this country was built by
struggling pioneers with no money
but faith in the future. Facts show that
it took capital in the pioneering days just
as capital is needed for most enterprises
today.
The wool industry was built by men
with capital, mostly British, and they
built it with amazing rapidity. In less
than 30 years, following John Mac-
arthur’s first shipment, the sheep had
found their way to virtually every
present-day sheep-grazing district. There
is nothing comparable anywhere in the
history of European settlement.
Since colonial times wool has been the
greatest contributor to Australia’s wealth.
Even today it accounts for up to half
our income from exports. We could get
along without it, but to what degree is
problematical. In terms of gross national
product it has, in the last few years,
ranged between four and five per cent.
But in the boom of 1950-51 it went as
high as 18 per cent and just where the
chain of dependence and interdepen-
dence begins and ends is something no
statistic yet devised can ascertain with
accuracy.
In 1964 we remain the world’s main
wool producer with more than one-sixth
of the world’s sheep, shearing more than
one-quarter the world’s wool. As yet,
there is no rival in sight.
Government played no part in this
story. Macarthur created a climate in
which the wool industry and Govern-
ment took separate paths. The industry
was started and maintained by men of
sturdy independence, traditionally re-
sentful of anything even smacking of
Government interference.
Now, in 1964, Sir William Gunn,
chairman of the Australian Wool Board
and of the International Wool Sec-
retariat, has brought the industry, and a
good section of it perhaps unwillingly,
to the brink of the altar for a marriage
with Government.
The Commonwealth Government, one
month ago, agreed to make available
some £5,250,000 a year to add to the
growers’ contribution of £7,250,000 for
wool promotion and research. A fort-
night ago Gunn presented the report of
the Wool Board’s marketing committee
to the Australian Wool Industry Con-
ference. The report recommends a
reserve price scheme for the marketing
of wool and a major item of this plan
is that the Commonwealth Government
will be asked to provide £60,000,000
as financial backing.
There seems every likelihood that the
plan will go through and will be in
operation for the 1965-66 selling season.
When that happens the woolgrower will
be no more sturdily independent than
the rest of us, even though, as Eric
Hitchins so aptly put it in 1953, this
independence has been largely illusory
for some time.
Some graziers will regret the report’s
recommendations; the majority, with
Gunn, will see them as a logical, com-
monsense move. This is not 1860 and
in the context of world trade, tariffs,
the wages, taxation and other factors,
becoming more and more Government
concerns, the woolgrower might just as
well be in it with everyone else,
Essentially, the reserve price plan is
not new. It is a natural progression
from the emergency plans of World War
I and World War II both rejected by
the wool industry as soon as things re-
turned to normal. Not that things ever
did exactly return to normal,
In its report to the Australian Wool
Industry Conference in Canberra, pre-
sented by Gunn, the Wool Board said
the scheme would bring some stability
to wool prices and to the incomes of
growers and others in the wool trade,
while protecting growers against short-
term market fluctuations which caused
values to touch low levels without real
economic or trade justification. The
report recommended that a statutory
authority, to be known as the Australian
Wool Marketing Authority, consisting
of a chairman and four to six members,
should be appointed by the Wool In-
dustry Conference to administer the
scheme.
The reserve price itself should be
conservative and the Wool Industry
Conference, and the Wool Board, should
decide how it would be determined,
All woolgrowers will by now know
how the system would operate. For
those unfamiliar with wool the prin-
ciple is this: when wool, in the auction


room, dips below the reserve price the
authority steps in and buys it. The
authority holds the wool and feeds it
back on the market when prices recover.
Similar schemes have operated in New
Zealand and South Africa since World
War 11.
The Government, and the taxpayer,
come into it in the provision of
£60,000,000, plus £20,000,000 con-
tributed by growers, as the bank for the
authority. It should be clear that this
£80,000,000 is not necessarily to be
used, and in fact it may never have to
be used at all.
It is merely a Government under-
writing to give the Authority the financial
power to buy in wool if it has to. And
any wool bought is, in itself, almost as
good a security as money itself. That
it, unless there is a major catastrophe
such as a war or a world depression. In
that case the dissipation of £80,000,000
would be a small part of general
financial ruin for the nation.
It cannot be stressed too strongly that
this reserve price recommendation of
the Wool Board is conservative. The
auction system is retained, with the
addition of a bottom limit. The wool-
brokers and most other individuals and
firms in the marketing end of the
business are not threatened. Even the
futures market, an existing form of
“hedging” against possible market reces-
sion, is included in the overall scheme.
The report says that “the operation of
futures markets generally should be kept
under close review”. There is no sug-
gestion of a move to close down futures
trading. About the only people likely to
be seriously affected are the private buy-
ers. Should the scheme come in, the need
for private selling will be largely eradi-
cated.
Problems
present an uncertain quantity of
wool, possibly seven per cent, is
bought on the property by private buy-
ers. The grower knows the price he is
getting and he does not have to wait too
long for it. He may not get as much as
he might by sending it through the auc-
tion room, but he saves himself anxiety.
For some growers private selling has its
advantages. Part of the recommended re-
serve price plan is that there be “further
close study” of the practicability of
making an advance payment to growers
when their wool is received in the store.
If this comes about private dealing may
disappear.
But there are many problems. First,
if the Commonwealth Government de-
cided it could not, or would not, make
funds available, the plan would surely
die. Without Government support the
banks would hardly provide the money;
while growers, already committed to
£7,250,000 a year for promotion and re-
search, would be hard put to raise the
£80,000,000 themselves. But the likeli-
hood of Government refusal is remote.
Somewhat surprisingly, there has been
no great public outcry against this pro-
posed use of taxpayers’ funds to protect
one of the most affluent sections of the
community.
In 1951, Sir Robert Menzies urged
growers to accept the then proposed
Post Joint Organisation reserve price
plan “in their own interest and that of
the national economy. The reserve price
plan will protect individual growers and
stabilise the industry. Growers will still
have the right to choose their own
broker, sell or not sell, or put their own
reserve on their clips. The plan is prac-
tical, financially sound, and consistent
with a free outlook.”
What killed the 1951 Post JO refer-
endum was a combination of three
things—the opposition of the woolbrok-
ing interests, fears of socialism —a hang-
over from the Chifley Government —and
the 1951 wool boom brought about by
the Korean war. Growers are now
likely to approach the vote on the present
plan much more calmly.
Woolbroking interests, likewise, may
not be as active in their opposition. They
have, since 1951, made one or two
changes themselves, including mergers of
the major brokers, which have reduced
the competitive urge perhaps; or maybe
the world-wide trend towards Govern-
ment participation in trade has had its
effect.
It is said also that, as private com-
panies reach the giant corporation level,
something of the public service attitude
begins to permeate their thinking. The
two giants are now Elder Smith Golds-
brough Mort, and Dalgety New Zealand
Loan. Together they act as brokers for
about half the total clip.
Another factor, possibly the most rele-
vant, is that in 1951 the woolbroking
institutions were far more closely aligned
with British wool - buying and British
capital. Dalgety NZL, Australian
Estates, and Australian Mercantile Land
and Finance are all English companies
formed originally in the tradition of the
Australian Agricultural Company—John
Macarthur’s company created with the
assistance of wealthy English investors.
Most of the other companies have strong
British links.
But since 1951 Japan has displaced
Britain as our biggest woolbuyer. This
is of tremendous importance and of far-
reaching effect.
Brokers’ power
I>ut even so the power of the broking
companies should not be under-
estimated. If they really wanted to cruel
this reserve price pitch they could do so.
For example, Dalgety NZL not only acts
as broker for some 25 per cent of the
clip but owns station properties running
some 500,000 sheep.
Australian Estates, while smaller, own
stations running about 300,000 sheep.
As 90 per cent of growers run less than
2000 sheep it can be seen what power
these companies would command if, in a
referendum on marketing, the vote was
given on some kind of plural basis (such
as one bale, one vote).
The vote is the major area in which
the reserve price scheme could fall apart,
although following the Canberra meeting
of the Wool Industry Conference, the
conference chairman, Sir John Crawford,
and Sir William Gunn made guarded
statements about there being a possibility
that a ballot might not be necessary.
The implied proviso was that the
Wool Industry Conference would, at its
next meeting in September, be in such
general agreement on the reserve price
plan that the Government would be con-
vinced that it was a true reflection of
woolgrower opinion. Obviously much
had gone on behind the scenes.
The Wool Industry Conference con-
sists of 25 delegates from the Australian
Wool and Meat Producers’ Federation
(in general terms representing smaller
growers in favor of a reserve price) and
25 from the Australian Woolgrowers
and Graziers’ Council (representing larger
growers who were generally “anti-inter-
ference or favored unfettered free auc-
tion).
The Woolgrowers and Graziers’ Coun-
cil, both by tradition and actual member-
ship (one does not have to be an actual
woolgrower to belong), often reflects
woolbroking opinions. In the past it
has always fought strongly against
marketing change.
Right up until the eve of the Canberra
conference it was believed that the
Graziers would fight again. They can
still. They have until September to hold
a series of branch meetings to allow the
general membership to weigh the pro-
posal.
But if a fight is likely it is curious that
there was no indication of it from at
least some of the 25 Graziers’ delegates
at the Canberra meeting of the Wool
Industry Conference. It also explains


w hy Sir John Crawford was able to
announce that the conference had decid-
ed in general unanimity that considera-
tion of the plan should be proceeded
with. And why Sir William Gunn was
able to announce: “We have not intro-
duced a plan to have it thrown out.”
A clue to the new line of thinking on
the part of the Graziers was given in
the address of the Federal president, Mr
X. L. Bull, at the annual convention held
in Canberra two days before the Wool
Industry Conference.
Probably the most comprehensive
annual report ever made by a Graziers’
Federal president, it ranged far beyond
matters concerned with the growing of
wool. It now seems a fair interpreta-
tion that the Graziers may have decided
to go along with a reserve price, pro-
vided the Government comes to the
party also.
A foregone conclusion
/There are rumors that Gunn personally
swayed his Wool Board marketing
committee into coming out in favor of
reserve price. Whether this is so we will
probably never know. But the only point
that matters is that the report is in favor
of reserve price. If a vote of Australia’s
118,000 woolgrowers is taken on a “one
grower, one vote basis” the result is a
foregone conclusion. The Government
has indicated it will not tolerate a plural
vote.
Gunn, a grazier, also now has his
former critics on his side —at least for
the time being. Lawrence Simpson, the
most consistent of them, called a meet-
ing of his own in Canberra (70 attended
but not Gunn, although he was invited)
and announced that he would person-
ally do all he could to get grower ap-
proval for any kind of marketing plan
just so long as it was a step in the right
direction.
Simpson has a right to feel extremely
satisfied. Down to almost every detail,
including the tentative 54 pence reserve,
the plan follows closely the one Simpson
has been advocating for two years.
Already, at this early stage, it is pos-
sible to predict likely regional reaction
to the plan. Smaller growers in all States
are for it. Bigger growers in Queens-
land, led by Gunn himself, were for the
plan in 1951 and will be even more so
this time.
The strongest holdout may come
from the bigger growers in NSW but it
is said that many, particularly in north-
ern NSW, are now behind Gunn. Bigger
growers in Victoria and South Australia
are said to be reacting not unfavorably.
The attitude of woolbrokers is said
to have altered considerably, in many
directions, since the Portland Wool In-
quiry three years ago. They lost heavily,
particularly in prestige, at the hands of
the Bolte Government. A major re-
appraisement of policy followed.
Advocates of reserve price are said
to be happy with the financial aspect.
The “revolving plan” means that, as the
Wool Marketing Authority profits accrue,
so the contributing growers will get,
eventually, their money back.
And the future of wool? Two barriers
yet to be cracked are the American
market and a lift in production.
If Americans used as much wool per
head of population as Australians it
could mean an additional three million
bales a year—equal to 60 per cent of
our wool clip. The International Wool
Secretariat's belief that promotion can
increase American consumption now
appears to be unrealistic.
The reason why Americans do not
use wool extensively is the high tariff,
designed to protect American wool-
growers which in turn gives American
synthetic fibre manufacturers an un-
restricted home market. American
woollen manufacturers, what there are
of them, are caustic about IWS promo-
tion of wool in the US. They describe
it as unsophisticated and amateurish.
Running advertisements in a few lush
magazines is not going to alter the lead
that synthetics have over wool in the
fashion market. The real answer may
lie in Australian Government pressure
to get the tariff lowered. Under the
proposed marketing change, with the
Government acting as banker, there may
be a better opportunity to press home
the point.
Wool’s future as a big earner seems
assured, provided production can be
kept up and costs stabilised.
The 1951 wool cheque—a record
£633,000,000 —may not be equalled for
a long time. But the 1963-64 season,
just completed, resulted in a cheque of
£447,000,000, the best since 1956-57
(£482,000,000) and the third best ever.
Production may be up at least 6 per
cent next year and demand should hold.
But if costs continue to rise, and pro-
duction levels off (as it is tending to do)
then there could be trouble ahead.
A more scientific approach to wool-
growing holds promise but it is limited
by cost —the trouble with lifting pro-
duction by improved pastures is that it
is very expensive. In addition improved
pastures often means coarser merino
wool. The answer to this may be in
better breeding even though the industry
generally does not appear to think so.
Opinion on the ultimate volume of
wool production in Australia is divided.
Many believe that a clip twice the size
of the present is possible. Others be-
lieve the best we can hope for is an
increase of about 20 per cent. In this
field the Government can extend the
part it already plays in conjunction with
the CSIRO.
However, the best land is already
occupied and the old cry of “unlock
the lands” would not necessarily help
to increase wool production. But there
are many areas of unalienated suitable
lands still available which could be
brought into production. In West Aus-
tralia there is an estimated 25,000,000
acres which could be used. Merely
surveying it into farm areas and throw-
ing it open for all comers is not suffi-
cient, however, because of today’s deve-
lopment costs. Some form of national
land settlement policy seems the only
feasible way of developing these areas.
The remarkable thing about the wool
industry is that the divisions within it
have lasted for so long. There is no
parallel in other primary industries.
Dairyfarmers, wheatgrowers, poultry-
men, and others simply belong without
major schisms to their respective orga-
nisations. There are differences of
opinion, of course, but they are techni-
calities, of concern only to the industry
itself.
The common touch
Tf Gunn pulls this off he will have
achieved what many thought was
impossible. The gulf between the big
growers (a mere 15,000 own sheep pro-
ducing half the total clip) and the small
growers has been very real up till now.
Only Gunn —himself out of the top
15,000 —could do it. And only Simpson
possibly—also one of the top 15,000 —
could have stoked the fire so success-
fully.
But whereas Simpson has an enigma-
tic quality, Gunn has the common touch
and a brand of audacity which appeals
to the mass of woolgrowers. He gets
himself into hot water, gets out of it
just as rapidly, and if he sometimes
makes enemies he does not arouse
hatred.
This lead from the top was absolutely
essential for a marketing change to have
any real hope of success. The matter is
by no means final but the tide may be
said definitely to have turned.


OUT AND ABOUT
Islands in
the Sun
The layman’s guide to the lazy
man’s holiday
By HUGH CURNOW
If the sunburnt woman seated opposite
us hadn’t called out: “My God, she’s
going to hit!” we might not have
seen it happen. But, sure enough, a few
moments later we watched the graceful
Sydney yacht llena sail slap-bang on to
the reef that also is within full view of
the Hayman Island cocktail lounge. At
the time we were aboard one of
Mr Ansett’s pay-as-you-sway pleasure
launches, returning to Hayman with
some two dozen other day-trippers from
a tour of Whitsunday Islands. When we
got ashore and arrived at the hotel
lounge, everyone was talking about llena.
She had ground to an abrupt halt,
crunching heavily on the reef. Soon
after, she had developed a splendidly
observable list.
Still later, when llena floated free
from the coral on the rising tide, the
celebrity who had been at her helm
came ashore. Then there was' more to
talk about. The notable helmsman was
newspaper-owner Rupert Murdoch . . .
Someone suggested that there might be
an omen somewhere in Ilena’s brief
brush with a reef for Mr Murdoch’s
national daily, “The Australian”. But
it was everyone else in the crowd nearby
who asked with increased interest: “What
national daily?”
It’s like that on Queensland’s islands
north of Capricorn: they encourage you
to stay out of touch with what’s going
on. It is all part of the insidious island
salve of what-the-hell that you find on
all tiny holiday resorts surrounded com-
pletely by water. And it is acutely catch-
ing. More hair is let down at Hay-
man than ever was put up in Sydney.
The period of readjustment to things
citified and current seems to vary
directly with the length of your sojourn
amid those balmy islands in the sun.
A man could lose himself among
them for a lifetime. Some have. But
we had only five weeks of escape and
spent most of them on one of the best-
known (Hayman) and possibly the least-
known (Bedarra). We managed also
to visit Green, Dunk, Timana (N.B.
later), South Molle and Dent. The most
stinging setback to your island holiday
budget up there is paying for drinks.
Even a longish glass of “tropical” (can-
ned) fruit juice can cost 3s. 6d. with ice.
But by far the worst part is getting
there especially if, like us, you take
the family car. Those near-at-hand out-
posts of dreamland are not as close as
all that. One of the most popular,
Green Island, beyond the horizon off
Cairns, is more than 1200 road miles
north of the Gold Coast. Bedarra,
probably the most beautiful and exclu-
sive, is off-shore from Tully, more than
1000 by rail. And Hayman, about as
close a patent Paradise as you can get,
is all of 1400 by land from Sydney. It
is a heck of a trip if you don’t want
to waste time getting there. The chances
of reaching Hayman’s airport town,
Proserpine, with your original wind-
screen still intact are remote if you travel
more than 40 mph and like to keep all
four wheels on the bitumen.
The main Bruce Highway north of
Bundaberg sports twin broad shoulders
of assorted loose gravel, pebbles, stones
and small rocks for more than 400 miles.
It takes little impetus from thundering
trucks’ tyres to transport these into air-
borne, seemingly-guided missiles that
hurtle into oncoming windscreens with
amazing regularity, exploding them into
smithereens. Within 200 yards on one
stretch of gravel-strewn roadside between
Rockhampton and Mackay half-a-dozen
former windscreens twinkle in a thou-
sand fragments. Regular travellers have
discarded Bruce and, instead, call it the
Crystal Highway. Not that local ser-
vice station owners object. One told us
to cheer up, we weren’t the only ones.
He said he’d replaced 142 windscreens
that week already.
Sensible people, of course, fly to the
island of their choice. That, too, can
be harrowing if you’re in the bulk of
tourists who take the package-deal vaca-
tion. You can’t fly right to your island
by this plan. You can do that only if
you travel in style and fly up independ-
ently by day. As the all-in fortnight
package deal at Hayman, for example
costs £7 less than the return first-class
airfare to Melbourne, southern contin-
gents much prefer the all-in deal, as do
the majority of tourists.
This means night-flying, usually i n
Fokkers, followed by a 25-mile bus trip
if you’re headed for the Whitsunday
group. Then comes the celebrated launch
trip from Shute Harbor. Locals will
warn you that this trip often separates
your “insides” from your “outsides”.
Having mewled and puked our way
through some of these Whitsunday pas-
sages we can report the locals speak
from long experience. Arriving at dawn
on what is to be his island home for
the next two weeks, even the most
determined pleasure-seeker may feel that
what his insides really are telling his
outsides is that they should have gone to
Surfers again this year, as usual.
The long lines of departing holiday-
makers chanting “We know what you
came for —and you’re going to get it!”
(a Hayman habit) doesn’t help much.
Nor does the sight of six spick-and-span
lads, standing in an impeccably straight
row on the Hayman Island train plat-
form ready to carry your bags, do much
for morale at 5.30 a.m. after a mostly
sleepless night.
The Evening Spectacular
T mention this feeling of general dis-
may only because it seems a fairly
common sentiment among the package-
dealers who account for the most
important section of most Barrier Reef
island guest lists. But there it often
ends. The same southerners—you don’t
meet many Queenslanders —undergo a
remarkable reversal of sentiments, almost
without exception, by sundown of that
same, stoic, first day. Mainlanders
have had time to find their island legs
by then. And they’ve certainly found
time to sample the island food they’ve
already paid for. (About the only thing
we discovered all the islands up there
have in common is an above-average
meal, three times a day.)
And, to cap it all, there’s the Evening
Spectacular. No tourist brochure has
yet done justice to it. I should men-
tion here that the sun doesn’t just set
among those northern islands. Rather,
it slinks, by stages, through the sea haze
down to the edge of the Pacific—usually
taking care to set itself off with a few
palms, a volcanic peak, or any distant
sails that may be on hand. Then, quite
suddenly, it strips. Off comes all the
dazzle and down she goes, naked as a
new penny, outlined against a shot-silk
sky. There’s one final, flamboyant flash,
then that, too, is quenched and another
night on a tropic isle has begun . . . It’s
all quite devastating to mainlanders’ eyes
at what seems uncannily close quarters.

The entertainment problem is minimal
a t Bedarra. The necessarily select
clientele there (maximum accommoda-
tion is 13 at a time) prefer to entertain
themselves. “Discovered” by wealthy
and mob-shy southerners over the past
few years, it is still mercifully unspoiled
an d completely uncommercialised.
(Rates are £3 10s. a day and all you can
buy on the island is basic grog. For
special brands, wire ahead.) Bedarra is
unique, not only because it is possibly
the only holiday island that doesn’t sell
suntan lotion. The few who get there
have their own cabins each set a few
yards away from their own sandy beach.
A generation ago the dreams of a
Frenchman, Pierre Hure, and his English
friend came true at Bedarra. They had
settled on the bare, barren leeward side
of the tiny, triangular-shaped island,
found water and planted a tremendous
tropical garden along the foreshore,
Landscaped, terraced and sprinkled with
white gravel paths, an exotic botanical
bower began to cover their labors. To-
day the profusion of palms, orchids,
breadfruits, avocadoes, grapefruits, flame
trees, hibiscus, frangipani and some less-
familiar Tahitian flowering vines has
reached Hollywoodian proportions.
Holidayers tend to keep to them-
selves on Bedarra, meeting only for
cruises or meals prepared by the island’s
talented Irish cook, Mary Mead. Swim-
ming and sunbathing on your own beach
without the addition of swimming cos-
tumes is not only possible but often
preferred. Dress for all meals is infor-
mal, usually barefoot. Sole owner of
this “open” section of the island, Ken
Druitt, says he recently refused an offer
of £lOO,OOO for it.
As well as having no fleas, houseflies
or snakes, Bedarra is one of the only
two freehold islands in Queensland. Like
the Whitsunday group it is unpleasant to
get to, but devotees think it worth every
bump and lurch. So, too, did artist
Noel Wood 27 years ago when, aged
24, he bought the north-eastern corner
of the island and set about building his
own home with driftwood and thatched
palm leaves. It is still standing and
Mr Wood is still there, living alone and
liking it. He told us, over a cup of
wild honey-sweetened coffee, that he is
self-sufficient, making his own flour from
kasava roots and cultivating, along with
the usual island fruits, a salad farm
complete with cajanus inicus—a type of
edible pea which he prefers to the frozen
variety. Surrounded by a silence no
wireless disturbs, he paints landscapes,
seascapes and vegetation but no faces.
Among his few imports are books, which,
he says, keep him sane.
The only other inhabitant at Bedarra
is Victorian cattleman Colin Scott, who
owns the south-eastern section of the
island, has built an excellent home there
with 180-degree views and flies up from
Omeo occasionally to visit it for just
a few days at a stretch. Among the
island lore is a tale of the original pur-
chaser of Bedarra, a Captain Allison,
who is said to have paid approximately
£5O for it in 1912. Records are slender
but it seems he swam regularly four
miles to Dunk Island, unaware or un-
afraid of sharks. Another fact that still
intrigues them at Bedarra is that
M. Hure and his English friend divided
the island chores equally between them.
•And, as you might not expect, the
Frenchman did the gardening and the
Englishman was the cook.
Exclusive Timana
T>edarra couldn’t be less like Hayman.
** But nearly Timana, situated between
Bedarra and Dunk, carries exclusiveness
a bit far, locals and envious visitors feel.
The two Victorian sisters (the former
Misses Val and Yvonne Cohen) who own
it haven’t set foot on it for years. White
ants now are eating the sign on Timana’s
slim sandspit which warns trespassers
they will be prosecuted. An idyllic isle
where natural water has yet to be dis-
covered, its tanks are rusted and its
beach is eroding. Only the charm of its
freehold, meanwhile, remains unchanged.
Dunk, the white hope of Avis Cars,
has been having its share of problems.
too. While we were there the island’s
only launch, laden with provisions, over-
turned and sank while approaching its
anchorage. An unsuccessful attempt to
raise it by hauling its mast with a tractor
chain succeeded only in snapping off
the mast. A honeymooning and thirsty
young man who went skindiving to
salvage some crates of beer gashed his
leg on oyster shells. Mrs A. Fenn-Smith,
of Swansea, Tasmania, who, together
with her grazier husband, was giving
Dunk a try “to make a change from
Hayman”, came down with double puen-
monia the next day and the flying doctor
had to supply emergency transport to
hospital.
The island’s new manager, Keith
De Witt, told us he had lost everything
when the launch capsized. He said he
and his wife had had their belongings
shipped across from the mainland on it,
uninsured. They feel that little else
can go wrong and things must improve.
We understand that the long-plan idea
is not to attempt to rival the pleasure-
offerings of Hayman but to develop
Dunk as something of a shrine to the
memory of its famed naturalist,
E. J. Banfield. A luxury shrine, we
gather.
Hayman, the former white elephant
of Mr Ansett, though not the most
expensive in the Whitsunday group, is
definitely the most extraordinary. One
of the first things you see as the launch
approaches the long all-tide pier is a
candy-striped train chugging out along
it to meet you. It’s not a full-size train,
but an adult-scaled version of those
trains in children’s playgrounds. That
first ride in, past the front lines of
cabins to the hotel platform, is something
that arriving guests who thump across
the water to the beach in a seaplane miss
out on. You can’t help feeling the cir-
cus is arriving—and you’re it.
This is perpetuated nightly as each
evening you are encouraged to dress up,

approach to a night out according to
which particular “night out” it happens
to be. They have 14 of them, all differ-
ent, all staged in rotation. One night it’s
Left Bank, another it’s Right. There’s
even a Get-To-Know-Your-Neighbor
Night complete with snowballing, pick-
any-partner dances. The fortnightly
climax is a New Year’s Eve Mardi Gras
where, if you’re staying longer, you can
see the new lot of package-dealers in as
well as the old lot out. We took a few
days to get accustomed to the Butlin-
type atmosphere. However, once you
realise that it isn't required to be sophis-
ticated at all but it’s all right to just
relax and even skip the Get-To-Know-
Your-Neighbor night if you want to,
you can have a whale of a time, along
with almost everyone else, including the
island band. They manage to play
happily by day as well as at night, being
some of the few members of the “staff”
who are allowed to fraternise with
guests.
The unhappy o.nes
llTith their families, the 140 staff at
Hayman total 200. Most are em-
ployed in the running of the hotel which
has accommodation for 320. The only
people we met at Hayman (after the
first day or two) who said they were
unhappy were staff. Not many of them,
but enough to leave an impression that
a job is a job even on an island in the
south-west Pacific. Actually, Mr Ansett
offers permanent Hayman staff enough
perks to encourage them to spend their
lives there. And as well as better accom-
modation the higher they go, all staff
whose children get through the Hayman
primary school to secondary school are
promised £3 a week extra per child. At
present there are 42 children on the
island. Two-thirds of them are infants,
conceived on Hayman and born on the
mainland. The island has no resident
doctor. A medical sister handles routine
illnesses and treatments.
If it did have a doctor the Royal
Hayman Hotel would be even more like
a ship. Meals, prepared in the French
manner by Lee, the Chinese chef, are
fine, even on the table d’hote. Then,
after a fortnight they, too, suffer from
sameness. But, as people who can afford
to stay longer than the package-deal two
weeks often order a la carte or line
up something special in the Gold Room
restaurant, they say sameness doesn’t
bother them.
Organiser and virtual creator of the
holiday that is Hayman is the island’s
naturalised-Australian manager, Andre
Maestracci. A handsome, black-
moustached, 34-year-old, Mr Maestracci
has been at Hayman for nine years. In
that time he recalls 13 other managers
who had a go at running things. “It
was the island that beat them. It takes
a lot of handling. It gets me down at
times, too. But I have an arrangement
that whenever I feel I am going to bust
I can book myself an air ticket and fly
away somewhere at a moment’s notice
until I cool off,” he says. We spent a
week trying to catch Mr Maestracci in
an off-duty period for an interview.
Finally it was arranged for 6 a.m., after
he had returned from Proserpine with
a new consignment of tourists, had seen
them to their cabins and was taking an
hour over breakfast. He had been on
the move for 32 hours having been up
all the night before last with the Mardi
Gras. He showed little signs of wear
and, over a hearty breakfast, said things
are looking better than ever before for
Mr Ansett at Hayman. “Our rate of
occupancy for the year has averaged
82 per cent. That's the highest for any
tourist resort hotel in the world, you
know”, he said. Such claims are diffi-
cult to check out for accuracy but
Mr Maestracci certainly sounds as if he
believes Hayman is now tops.
A man with a number of nicknames
among regular guests and staff (samples
include “Big Daddy” and “The Angry
Mousetrap”), he also believes that Hay-
man gives good value for the tourist
pound. Most package - dealers agree,
though the prices of drinks remain diffi-
cult to swallow. A glass can of beer is
3s. 6d., as is a nip of whisky, gin or
Australian brandy. The Mai Tai we
ordered was, we were told, mixed
exactly the same way they do it in
Hawaii. A rum concoction, it sells in
Honolulu for approximately a dollar.
At Hayman it costs 15s. “But we
make much more money at the island
shop selling souvenirs, towels, bikinis,
etc., than we do with the bar trade”, says
Mr Maestracci. “Anyway”, he adds,
“South Molle, Long Island and Linde-
mann charge the same prices as we do
for beer and spirits, so who can com-
plain?” The point is well taken. Hid-
den extras are few on the islands. Those
they have, the island managers seem to
have kept at a common level.
Plans are in the air, we learn, for a
package deal that includes only daylight
flying to Proserpine, followed by a quick
flip over to Hayman in 26-passenger
helicopters. “Then”, says Mr Maestracci,
“we’ll really get off the ground here”.
The 20-year dream, starting now, is to
build enough hotels on the island to ac-
commodate 5000 tourists, he told us. On
an island “where your dreams come
true” that is one Mr Ansett will be able
to realise only when they solve the pro-
blem of conserving Hayman's annual
76-inch rainfall. Even now the occasional
shower runs dry while you’re still soaped.
Water is not plentiful and pressure can
be weak. At Hernando’s Hideaway, the
late-party dive about five minutes’ walk
from the hotel, the barman refused one
Sydney woman a straight glass of water
with which to swallow her aspirin while
we were there. “The water is for the
whisky”, he told her.
Though the hotel rejoices in the name
of The Royal Hayman (because of a
once-cancelled royal visit by the late
King George VI, says Mr Maestracci),
it has yet to receive royal patronage. That
remains the boast of its distant Whit-
sunday neighbor, Lindemann, which,
though it is not called Royal Lindemann
Island, is now the most expensive to stay
at, averaging about ten per cent higher
rates than Hayman. They are still grate-
ful to Princess Alexandra at Lindemann.
Almost as grateful as we are to Mr
Ansett. Who knows, without the lure
of Hayman we may never have also
found Bedarra.
Things Bright and Beautiful
Buying for enjoyment rather than investment
By CHARLES SRIBER
is a young country and ob-
viously at first people wanted
*“■ a roof over their heads, some-
thing to sleep in and something to eat,”
Mr Robert Haines said. “Later, it became
important what kind of roof they had,
what kind of a bed and what they ate.”
Tall, athletic (he used to ride a surf
board) Mr Haines, director of David
Jones’ Sydney Art Gallery, led the way
into the redesigned gallery where paint-
ings, wood carvings, furniture, ceramics
and other art objects were displayed.
The gallery is more compact these
days and much more elegant. Material-
covered, moveable screens limit its rather
intimidating vastness. “I felt the old gal-
lery looked more like a Sunday school
hall than an art gallery,” he to’d me,
“the presentation of a work of art is
most important. The greater the work
the more carefully it needs to be pre-
sented.”
You enter the new gallery through
double Louis XV oak doors taken from
a French country house. The pictures
and objects are arranged to comple-
ment each other and their surround-
ings. The pieces handled by the
gallery nothing later than 1800


might grace any museum or house. Yet
all are for sale and some of the prices
are surprisingly modest.
“More and more young people are
buying,” Mr Haines said, “and things
of good design and quality, whether
antique or modern, need not be ex-
pensive. They choose things they can
use country furniture, wrought iron,
Thai and Chinese ceramics things of
beauty and use.” He pointed out a
simple, Ming Dynasty bowl marked up
for 30 guineas, Spanish wrought-iron
candle-holders for 8 guineas, an English
18th-century, oak cricket table for 30
guineas.
But not everything is low priced. The
first exhibition held in the newly design-
ed gallery offered a magnificent and
moving Rodin bronze one of the
preliminary studies for the “Burghers of
Calais” that sold for 3750 guineas, while
a Vuillard painting, “Woman in Blue”,
was unsold at 19,750 guineas, but was
subsequently quickly sold in London.
“The gallery is gradually becoming
internationally known,” Haines said,
“and more and more overseas visitors
are coming to see us. Some of the best
things we have sold have gone to the
United States and Canada.”
This is a matter of great regret to
Melbourne-born Robert Haines, who
would like to see all the important things
remain in Australia.
The changes wrought by Haines are
clearly the result of his zeal and deep
love of the work he handles. Leading me
into his makeshift office a partitioned
area taking in what was once the audi-
torium-like stage at the end of the old
gallery he relaxed in an 18th-century
English country chair, sorted papers on
his modern Australian desk and told me
something of his background and plans
for the future. A French chandelier was
suspended from an unpainted Oregon
beam. A Louis XV mirror hung from a
nail knocked into one of the uprights
of the unlined dividing wall. Screens,
chairs, sculpture were stacked on the
floor and stage.
Interest in sculpture
Robert Haines came to Sydney after
relinquishing directorship of the
Queensland Art Gallery; a move that
created quite a storm north of the
border. He resigned the post in 1960
in protest over a Queensland Govern-
ment move to build a cultural centre in
the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. Not
that he objected to the cultural centre as
such, but the art gallery was to have
been an appendage to other halls and
buildings some of which would house
commercial exhibitions. “The plan to
incorporate the art gallery in this other
project was incomprehensible,” he said.
“Over the nine years of my term as
director —I was appointed in 1951 after
four years as assistant director of the
National Gallery of Victoria the
Queensland gallery was gradually im-
proved out of all recognition.
“I have always been specially inter-
ested in sculpture and persuaded my
trustees to buy three works by Rodin,
two Degas bronzes and Epstein’s famous
‘The Visitation'. Incidentally, Epstein
offered the piece for the cost of casting
and even then it was only accepted with
some difficulty. We also acquired three
other works by Epstein and ‘Madame
Renoir’ by Renoir, British paintings by
Sickert, Matthew Smith, Augustus John
and many others, but the gift enabling
the gallery to buy ‘La Belle Hollandaise’
by Picasso and Degas’ ‘The Dancers in
a Class’ gave the gallery two modern
masterpieces unequalled in Australia.
The £126,000 gift also acquired from
the Rubin collection paintings by Vla-
minck, Toulouse-Lautrec, two other
Picassos and a Renoir.”
Born in St Kilda in 1916, a product
of Caulfield Grammar School and Mel-
bourne University, Haines studied at the
National Gallery School before entering
the Army education services, AIF. On
his discharge, with the rank of lieu-
tenant, he inaugurated the Melbourne
Georges Gallery and in 1947 was ap-
pointed the first assistant director of the
State’s National Gallery.
A British Council scholarship in 1950
took him to the Courtauld Institute of
Art, London University. While over-
seas he made the acquaintance of many
artists and sculptors including Sir Jacob
Epstein and Matthew Smith. He
moved about the Continent and when
he returned to Australia to take up his
Queensland appointment he brought a
cosmopolitan background of great ad-
vantage to his new post.
In 1957 he visited the United States
for the Prime Minister's Department to
organise and open an exhibition of the
furniture of Melbourne cabinet-maker
Krimper. Krimper is the designer and
maker of the modern desk at which
Haines now works. Haines has a high
opinion of the work, which he classes
among the world's really important
examples of craftsmanship.
David Jones’ chairman of directors,
Charles Lloyd Jones, asked Robert
Haines to inaugurate a fine arts gallery
at the firm’s Market Street (Sydney)
store. Early this year this was merged
with the Art Gallery under Haines’ direc-
torship, and exhibitions of both fine and
decorative arts are regularly shown.
Dealing in fine arts today is a highly
competitive business and the treasures
once found in the homes, shops and
auction rooms of many European coun-
tries are gradually becoming exhausted.
Haines still tours Europe every year.
“But I seldom attend auctions,” he said.
“It takes a great deal of time and prices
are increasingly high. Dealers have
almost denuded Spain of anything of
real value. But one finds that one can
always be lucky. This applies to nearly
every European country. But some
amazing junk is sold to undiscerning
travellers.”
In the sphere of fine art, Haines has
become the sole agent for several im-
portant European painters and sculp-
tors. Sydney will soon see an exhibition
of abstract pictures by the Greek painter
Spyropoulos. The Italian sculptor
Emilio Greco is another whose work he
handles. Next year an exhibition of
Greco's works will tour the Australian
State galleries. Haines pointed to a small
unframed painting of exotic foliage and
flowers. “That's the most recent Philip
Sutton. Albert Finney brought it down
with him from Fiji.” Sutton is cur-
rently working in Fiji and the gallery
will later show a second exhibition of
the work of this important British
painter.
Buying for enjoyment
T>obert Haines is convinced Austra-
lians can do and appreciate things
of basic value. While some people were
still buying for investment more and
more purchased for the sheer enjoyment
of the things they chose. It appears
a matter of great delight that people
enjoy the things he has on exhibition.
He led me out of his office and into
the gallery. We passed a wall of Philip-
pine antique wood carvings in the
Spanish style. A rash of red stickers
told of local appreciation. Rush-bottom
ladder chairs, cricket tables, candelabra,
a pair of sides of an 18th-century Sici-
lian cart, catalogued as suitable for bed
heads. He paused at the ceramics.
“These are from the excavations in the
Philippines—of Chinese origin. They
can be dated from the Southern Sung,
period (1227-1279), the Yuan period
(1280-1360) and the Ming period (1368-
1644). As you see they are simple,
beautiful and not expensive.
“Australian standards 'are improving
each year,” he assured me, “and better
things are being bought, but still over-
seas buyers are often more quickly dis-
cerning and some things I should have
liked to see remaining in Australia have
departed. The Australian galleries have
purchased from us and I think they
understand and appreciate what we are
trying to do. Collectors are also coming
from nearly all the States for our more
important exhibitions.
“I feel this is an exciting thing we are
doing. I am confident that it will be
increasingly successful and that it will
make some—if small —contribution to
the cultural . . Here he made a gri-
mace of doubt “. . . for want of a better
word —development of our country.”


OVERSEAS
INSIDE POLAND
Unsettled, dynamic, contradictory
By EUGENE BAJKOWSKI
(August 1 is the 20th Anniversary of the Warsaw uprising)
As the crack Prague-Warsaw-Mos-
cow “Chopin Express” thundered
into the night through darkened
Czechoslovakia I was getting hungry and
apprehensive. It was too late to go once
again through my suitcase and pockets
and check if my luggage contained any-
thing that might be found “incrimina-
ting” on the Polish frontier. Twelve
hours earlier, approaching the Czecho-
slovak frontier from Bavaria, I had
amused fellow passengers by throwing
out a mass of papers from the compart-
ment’s window. Out went various
visiting cards, scribbled notes, various
bits of printed matter and newspaper
cuttings. It was my first venture behind
the “Iron Curtain” in fourteen years and
I wanted to come out again.
But Poland was another country.
A gentle prod on my shoulder woke
me up. It was our attractive, blonde
Czech conductress saying good-bye.
Behind her stood a Czech officer and
two men in Polish uniforms. The train
was standing at Petrovice-u-Karviny, at
the Polish frontier.
The Czech stamped my passport and
handed it over to a tired-looking young
Polish officer in a neat summer uniform.
The Pole glanced at my passport, asked
me whether I spoke Polish, pulled out
a rubber stamp from his pocket, pressed
it against my passport and said he would
he back later. The customs man made
a pretence at examining my luggage and
signed my customs declaration.
Entering Poland one had the odd
feeling of being back in Western Europe.
Communist slogans, red stars and Rus-
sian-style uniforms disappeared. The
train now rumbled past village churches,
tall wooden crosses at the crossroads, gay
holiday crowds hiking, cycling or motor-
ing on the highways.
First impression
rFHE first impression is one of surprise
that people live as well as they do
and that visible Communist influence is
often absent. On my numerous rambles
through Poland I often forgot that I was
behind the “Iron Curtain”. People
moved about freely, trains, buses and
planes were crowded by holidaymakers.
People were well-dressed, women neat,
attractive and fashionable.
One cannot fail to be impressed by
the pace and scope of Poland’s economic
and social development. All the basic
modern industries have been established.
Poland is now a major producer of
steel, coal, heavy engineering goods,
locomotives and rolling stock, textiles,
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, chemicals,
motor vehicles and a large variety of
consumer goods. It is the world’s
twelfth largest shipbuilder and seventh
largest exporter of ships and marine
equipment. Gdansk, Szczecin and Gdynia
are among Europe’s largest and busiest
ports. Before the war Poland was barely
capable of producing small cars. Today
it builds its own jet planes and is a
leading manufacturer of light and special
purpose aircraft.
I did not notice any scarcity of food,
though occasional shortages of par-
ticular kinds of meat are not uncommon.
The whole country gives a thrilling,
though partly deceptive, impression of
continuous and dynamic growth. Some-
thing is always being built somewhere.
Three things are particularly im-
pressive. First, the reconstruction of
Poland’s ancient cities destroyed by the
war. Warsaw was razed to the ground
in successive waves of systematic destruc-
tion in 1939, 1943 and 1944. Gdansk
was burnt cut in 1945. As late as 1949,
Szczecin, Wroclaw and Kolobrzeg were
a giant pile of rubble. Well over 60 per
cent of all Polish cities, towns and
villages were severely damaged.
Today Warsaw is a large, spacious and
attractive city spread out on both banks
of the Vistula River. Its medieval “Old
City” has been painstakingly rebuilt
from old plans, paintings and photo-
graphs. Around these relics of the past,
a modern, carefully-planned city is
rapidly rising, not yet complete but
already fascinating. Warsaw’s peculiar
charm, of which its bustling crowds and
characteristic mannerisms are an essen-
tial part, is immune even to the mon-


strous (though useful) “Palace of
Culture”, which was Stalin’s hideous
“gift” to the Polish capital.
The reconstruction of Lower Silesia
and Western Pomorze was another feat.
In 1945 this was Poland’s “Wild West”.
Devastated and plundered, its cities in
rubble, its villages in ashes, its factories
and mines stripped and flooded, this
huge area was a hungry and desolate
concrete desert.
Most of its war-time German popu-
lation fled in the last months of war.
In 1945-47 three million Germans were
repatriated to Germany. Resettlement of
former Polish deportees and of refugees
from Eastern Poland (annexed by the
USSR) was a slow and laborious process.
Until 1955 there were large pockets of
virtually uninhabited wastelands.
Today more than 8 million Poles live
here. The process of integration with
the rest of the country is complete.
Silesia and Western Pomorze are the
leading industrial areas of Poland.
Arts and Culture
"Dapid industrialisation, however, is not
* an unusual thing in modern Europe.
More striking is Poland’s ability to gear
cultural development to its industrial
growth. Here the changes are breath-
taking. In 1950 illiteracy and semi-
literacy was a major problem. What-
ever may be said against the brutal
Stalinist regime of 1945-55 it must be
given credit for wiping out illiteracy.
Since 1956 spectacular progress has
been made. Every major city has its
own theatre, many have several. There
are large permanent opera companies in
Warsaw, Poznan and Silesia, several
world-class symphony orchestras, two
magnificent national folk troupes,
“Mazowsze” and “Slask”.
Poles are avid and intelligent readers
and many new Western titles reach
Poland well before they get to Aus-
tralia. Despite the rigors of censorship,
and Government monopoly of news-
print and paper supplies, Polish writers
manage to publish daring and contro-
versial books.
Culture plays a dominant role in
everyday life. Not only students, the
intellectual and professional classes and
snobs whom Poland does not lack
crowd theatres, art galleries, recitals and
exhibitions. The bug has caught on and
the sight of peasants in a horse-cart
trotting off to a Chopin recital is not
unusual. (
The prestige of a writer, scientist, poet,
film and stage actor, musician or a
journalist is high. Audience apprecia-
tion is exhilarating but demanding,
failure tragic, applause heartwarming,
criticism informed but often devastating.
A new social pattern
A new pattern of society has emerged
in the last decade. It is still un-
settled, dynamic, composed of contra-
dictory elements, potentially explosive.
The brutal social revolution, deliberately
imposed on a nation shattered by war
and bled white by the German occupa-
tion, has gradually lost its impetus. The
civil war has long ended, though many
mental barricades of the artificial revo-
lution are still there. But social changes
are continuing and the ferment goes on.
The passion for education and culture,
which is characteristic of modern Poland,
inevitably produces fresh demands for
greater intellectual freedom, more per-
sonal liberties. PZPR’s (the “Commu-
nist” Party’s) efforts to resist these de-
mands, and control not only the nation’s
economy and administration but also
its cultural habits, to impose a “Marxist”
imprint on Polish literature, science and
art, are fiercely and instinctively resisted.
The Press is strictly censored, subsi-
dised by the Government but doggedly
nonconformist and often rebellious.
News stories, book reviews and feature
articles are blue-pencilled and editorial
policies are imposed. But silent respect
of the masses is a valuable and almost
tangible commodity in Poland. The
nation’s spiritual backbone has not been
broken as it was in the USSR.
Until 1956 party patronage played a
dominant role in social advancement,
except on the lowest levels. After
Gomulka, education became the prime
factor, not for sentimental reasons. A
developing economy cannot be run by
ignorant amateurs, whose only “asset” is
a party card and a smattering of Marxist
jargon. Modern factories, railways, uni-
versities, mines and the touchy agricul-
ture must be run by professionals.
By 1956 Poland’s basic industries were
built up, mainly by ruthless exploitation
of material and human resources. But
the internal market was disrupted, heavy
industry swamped by semi-skilled labor,
agriculture suffering from a manpower
shortage and the managerial class poorly
trained and inefficient. The growing
numbers of young graduates were de-
manding jobs and a share of PZPR’s
power. The vast majority of them
were young professionals and intellec-
tuals, with their studies just behind them.
Often they just entered a new social
class and were more concerned with
making themselves acceptable to their
new peers than waving the flag for the
PZPR.
They are the silent power on whose
ultimate support the liberal intellectuals,
most of whom are themselves PZPR
members, now rely. This is the complex
background which makes “People’s
Poland” a country half-way between a
democracy and a one-party despotism,
part liberal and part Communist-ruled.
All this did not happen suddenly. To
understand the inside mechanism of the
“People’s Republic” we must go back
20 years.
The origins of Communist rule
July 22, 1944, a small group of
pre-war Communists, Left-wing
guerrillas, fellow-travellers and rabid
nationalists calling themselves the
“Polish Workers Party” (PPR) was set
up in Lublin as the “Polish Committee of
National Liberation” (PKWN), becom-
ing the de facto Government of a small
part of Poland, under Soviet patronage.
Polish territories east of the Bug River
were already annexed by the USSR. The
rest of Poland, including Warsaw, was
still occupied by the Nazis.
Swiftly the PKWN set about organis-
ing its “Lublin Poland”. The situation
was tense and confused. The Polish Air
Force was flying with the RAF and the
Polish Navy was under British opera-
tional command. Diplomatic relations
between the Polish Emigre Government
and Moscow were severed in 1943.
The front line ran right across Poland.
The grim fires of Auschwitz and other
extermination camps in Poland were still
burning fiercely. An average of 3000
Poles a day were being murdered by the
Nazis. Mass deportations were con-
tinuing. On August 1, 1944, the Warsaw
Uprising began, only to collapse after
savage fighting 63 days later, while the
Red Army looked on idly from the other
side of the Vistula River.
The bulk of the Polish resistance
movement, numbering over 450,000
men and women, obeyed the London
Emigre Government. The AK, the
underground Home Army, and its
civilian offshoots were poised to snatch
the power from under the nose of the
advancing Red Army and were a major
threat to the embryo Lublin regime.
But PKWN still had the upper hand.
At its disposal were 100,000 troops of
the First Army, originally formed in the
USSR in 1943 under the auspices of
yet another self-styled “Polish Com-
mittee of Patriots”, led by a Soviet
citizen, Wanda Wasilewska. Psycho-


logical factors aided Lublin. The First
Army troops were becoming restless
under Soviet command. Being placed
under the orders of the Lublin regime,
Communist-dominated but trying hard
to appear “genuinely Polish”, was more
palatable to the First Army men.
As the Red Army advanced further
towards the west, PKWN’s power in-
creased sharply. Just before Berlin fell
late in April, 1945, it commanded a
modern army of 400,000 men, which
participated in most major battles in
Poland and East Germany and stormed
into the German capital with the Soviet
troops. When the Third Reich finally
collapsed, it administered all of today’s
Poland.
The Stalinist period
Tn 1950-54 Poland passed through the
* macabre days of Stalinism. The
national economy, which was making
rapid progress despite enormous post-
war difficulties, was gripped by the iron
hands of doctrinaire Communist plan-
ners. The true Government of Poland
was the Soviet-dominated “Department
11” of the Ministry of Public Security,
run by thugs.
The latent anti-Semitism in today’s
Poland is largely due to the fact that
a small proportion of the few surviving
Jews came to occupy leading posts in
the secret police. Berman, Mine, Rozan-
ski, Swiatlo and Fejgin were all Jews
who managed to survive despite Stalin’s
own rabid anti-Semitism. It was they
who organised the political “show trials”,
hounded the former members of the
AK and broke up the Zionist resistance
groups which had managed to survive
the Ghetto Revolt of 1943. Their one
and only loyalty was to the Kremlin; they
gaoled alike Gomulka, Cardinal Wys-
zynski and representatives of the Jewish
international relief organisations.
It would be wrong, though, to com-
pare the Stalinist regime with the Ger-
man occupation. The Stalinists’ greatest
error was their simultaneous attempt to
drive Poland’s peasants into collective
farms and destroy overnight the in-
fluence of the Catholic Church.
Gomulka’s eight years
Tn June, 1956, the Poznan riots broke
* out. The Sino - Soviet split had
already started, though many years had
to pass before it became obvious. A few
days before the Hungarian Revolution,
Poland was on the brink of a general
revolt.
Communist rule in Poland could be
saved only if it was watered down, its
leadership changed and a considerable
measure of national sovereignty con-
ceded by Khrushchev. The Hungarian
Revolution forced Khrushchev’s hand.
After an angry wrangle, Gomulka be-
came the new leader.
Ageing, tired and courageous
Gomulka has dominated the Polish
scene ever since. His short-lived truce
with the Catholic Church was soon over,
but the ruthless struggle for power is
now going on within strictly defined
forms. Neither Gomulka nor the Car-
dinal provoke each other beyond endur-
ance. It is a silent, ruthless struggle
with Gomulka using the administrative
power of the State and the Church
relying on its age-old influence and
religious appeal.
Within the badly split PZPR itself,
Gomulka is relying on quiet purges.
Adroit moves aimed at provoking
factional fights within the opposing
groups appeal to the younger age
groups.
In 1956-63 Gomulka put through
several quiet but ruthless purges. Over
750,000 PZPR members were purged,
most of them before 1959. The PZPR
has 1,600,000 members and alternate
members. More than 40 per cent of
them are young people who joined the
party less than five years ago. This
new element is instinctively hostile to
the more totalitarian-minded ex-Stalin-
ists, the ageing “Partisan” clique led by
General Moczar and the small but voci-
ferous pro-Peking faction.
At the recent Fourth Congress of the
PZPR the Stalinists and “Partisans”
failed to get through into the “Political
Bureau”, the real seat of power. Their
strength lies in the provincial PZPR
organisations. Unfortunately, ex-Stalin-
ists, particularly the “Partisans”, are
well entrenched in the civil and secret
police.
On the whole, the bulk of the party
“cadres” are hostile towards Gomulka
and clamor for a tougher policy. They
often manage to sabotage Gomulka’s
directives and provoke clashes with the
peasants and the Catholics. They have
wide administrative powers over the
man in the street.
But in this also lies their basic weak-
ness. They are isolated from the masses
and from PZPR’s younger wing, which
is interested in personal careers and not
in politics. Gomulka is careful not to
provoke the peasants, and recently once
again solemnly promised to support
private agriculture. In case of emergency
he can appeal directly to the people and
to his chief rival for power, Cardinal
Wyszynski. His opponents, strong as
they are today, cannot do that. Time
is running out for both the Stalinists
and the “Partisans”. They are mostly
in their late forties or early fifties, many
are older. The youth is ruthlessly push-
ing them out. In ten years’ time they
will cease to be a political force. But
in the meantime they can do a great deal
of damage and Gomulka’s hesitation in
stamping them out may bring about a
dangerous crisis.
International relations
other asset is his inter-
national prestige. His voice now
carries weight in the Kremlin and is
listened to in Peking, Washington, Bonn
and Paris. Perhaps his use of the Sino-
Soviet crisis is not imaginative enough,
but he utilises it systematically to in-
crease his personal prestige and extend
Poland's national sovereignty. Warsaw is
no longer a satellite of Moscow. The
PZPR rules an independent and fiercely
nationalistic State and is tied to the
Kremlin more by the economic and
geographic facts of life than by ideology,
which Poles take as a joke.
Hostile as he is to Peking’s internal
policies, Gomulka is as unwilling as the
Rumanians to give Moscow outright
support. So far he has limited himself
to loud but basically empty gestures and
the Sino-Polish trade is booming, at the
expense of the USSR, Czechoslovakia
and East Germany. He is reluctant about
an international Communist conference
to outlaw Peking, as it could lead to
Moscow’s efforts to reinforce its grip
over Eastern Europe. He is busy fishing
in the muddy waters of the Far East
because Poland’s incidental but growing
influence there could become a bargain-
ing counter in his dealings with Moscow
and Washington.
Right now Gomulka has won a major
round. His carefully worded “Atom-
Free Europe Plan” was given a lot of
publicity, and provoked a direct ex-
change of Notes between Warsaw and
Bonn. It served him in good stead in
Poland, where the population has a
morbid fear of a West German Army
(or for that matter any German Army)
armed with atomic weapons. He de-
feated his rivals at the Fourth PZPR
Congress in June and gained greatly in
prestige from President Tito’s and Robert
Kennedy’s visits to Poland.
Robert Kennedy and his family made


a triumphant sweep of Poland in June,
addressed huge impromptu meetings and
were hailed by great crowds in Warsaw,
Krakow and Czestochowa. Although
Robert Kennedy’s “private trip” was
sparsely reported in the Polish Press, the
Government made no effort to dis-
courage mass shows of enthusiasm and
affection for the Americans. The US
Attorney - General was feted by the
Minister of Justice and conferred priv-
ately with Cardinal Wyszynski. Coincid-
ing with Tito’s visit, Robert Kennedy’s
triumphant tour of Poland was a major
but tactful show of independence
directed at Moscow. Robert Kennedy
reinforced the impression when he called
on the Poles “to become a bridge be-
tween the East and the West”.
Between Russia and Germany
/Geographical facts cannot be changed.
Poland lies squarely between Russia
and Germany. It loves neither but has
to live with both. Russia’s main asset lies
in it being the sole official guarantor of
Poland’s western frontier. Paris recognises
the Odra-Nysa (Oder-Neisse) line de
jure, but Washington and London only
de facto.
Warsaw’s relations with Bonn are
gradually improving under Erhardt’s
chancellorship. A West German Trade
Mission now operates in Warsaw and
numerous West German tourists visit
Poland. It is easier for an average Pole
to get a West German than an East
German visa.
The old issue of Odra-Nysa is the
main stumbling block. These lands are
now populated by 8,000,000 Poles.
They form an integral part of the Polish
economy, provide the bulk of in-
dustrial exports and have the highest
birth-rate in the country. Over three
million Polish children have been born
there since 1945. Half the present popu-
lation of Western Poland was originally
resettled from Eastern Poland, annexed
by Russia with Western consent in 1945.
If Poland’s western and northern areas
were lost, the country would cease to
exist.
This issue is as strong in Poland as it
is in Germany. The Poles in Poland
(not outside Poland) have become grudg-
ingly reconciled to the loss of Lwow,
Wilno, Pinsk and Eastern Poland to
Russia. There is nothing they can do
about it, though Lwow was never Rus-
sian whereas Wroclaw, Szczecin, Gdansk,
Olsztyn, Gorzow and Kolobrzeg were
Polish for centuries before the “Drang-
nach-Osten” gradually pushed them
back. Poles feel that the Odra-Nysa
frontier is due to them not only as a
“historic right” but also as a compensa-
tion for the Nazi occupation and the six
million war dead, of whom 90 per cent
perished in extermination camps. No
doubt official Polish propaganda makes
the most of this issue but it would have
been alive without it. Formal recog-
nition of Poland’s western frontier
would be a powerful blow against the
Kremlin.
The Church
factors make the Polish situa-
tion unique in Eastern Europe: its
Catholic Church, its traditional ties with
the West and 12 million people of Polish
extraction living abroad (10 million in
the United States).
The Church is a powerful force, well
entrenched, still wealthy (ironically, the
State pays the salaries of officiating
priests), with an all-pervading influence
reaching into the PZPR’s Central Com-
mittee. It has survived all attempts to
subvert it from within.
It is not merely a religious, but a poli-
tical force. Its religious prerogatives are
not in question. Religious practices are
not hindered and Poland lists more
religious feasts as public holidays than
France or Belgium, and many more
than Australia. The struggle for power
centres over its ancient privileges and
its political influence.
The Polish Church has traditionally
taken an active part in the country’s
politics, as a patriotic but conservative
force. It claims that the PZPR had con-
ceded to it the right to indoctrinate
Poland’s masses outside the Church.
This the Communists fiercely resist, often
using administrative pressure to which
the hierarchy replies by powerful blows.
There are 16,370 priests in Poland, a
large number of lay brothers, nuns and
theological students. This well-organised
and strategically-placed force gives the
Catholic hierarchy the upper hand.
Pressure is fought by counter-pressure.
When the Government resorts to strong-
arm methods, the Church responds by
failing to restrain fanatical mobs. A
religious riot is still easily provoked in
Poland and then the authorities have to
appeal to the Church for help or risk
creating martyrs.
Poland’s ties with the West are not
merely historic and cultural but also
economic. Over 42 per cent of Poland’s
export trade is with the non-Communist
world. Its outlook on life is basically
Western and in many respects Poland
today is a normal European country.
Twenty years in the Soviet bloc have not
left an appreciable mark on national
culture and daily habits, which were in-
fluenced by the West for over a thousand
years.
Twelve million people of Polish des-
cent living throughout the world are
also an important factor. Catholic and
anti-Communist, they are a major source
of foreign exchange and have an exten-
sive network of foreign and Polish lan-
guage publications at their disposal,
Despite censorship, emigre publications
find their way into Poland. In such
countries as the United States the local
Polish element is a powerful pressure
group. Gomulka is careful not to pro-
voke the overseas Poles unnecessarily,
and Warsaw has been known to bow
before their pressure.
Bleak prospects
Surprisingly, the immediate prospects
for Poland are bleak. Gomulka’s
regime remains the most liberal in Com-
munist-governed Europe. Rumania may
be moving away spectacularly from
the Kremlin, but its population is still
being held in an iron grip.
The fact that 34 leading intellectuals
could openly protest and, despite fierce
initial repression, largely win their point
is significant. That one may criticise the
regime openly and escape with merely
losing a job is an achievement in Eastern
Europe. Brutal force has been replaced
by pressure, cajoling and bargaining.
But Poland seems to have reached the
current limit of liberalism and in the
next few years there can be little im-
provement. A sort of apathy is settling
in, quiet, peaceful but dangerous.
And smiling faces hide grave econo-
mic problems. Within the next five
years jobs must be found for 1,000,000
new university and high school gradu-
ates. For the first time unemployment
is becoming a real problem. Post-war
population explosion is hitting Com-
munist and Catholic alike.
Capital reserves are low and new jobs
must be created by expanding heavy in-
dustry, which can be done only at the
expense of improvements in the standard
of living.
Intensified political control usually
follows the slowing down of the econo-
mic growth rate. An all-out campaign
to support private farming is being re-
sisted by the middle party echelon, as it
would lead to the fall of their influence.
This is what worries an average Pole
more than the spectacular fireworks of
courageous protests or the resounding
echoes of intra-party feuds.

JANEY IS CRYING
A SHORT STORY BY M. G. VINCENT
To look at Jim Sumners, a great
bullock of a man, his huge head
lolling sleepily on his broad
shoulders, his big brown eyes sliding
lazily about in their sockets like eggs in
cleft shells, no one would have thought
he had the energy to get in and out of
bed, let alone expend the effort to father
ten children. However, life being stranger
than fiction, the fact was that he had not
only ten children, but the two eldest,
girls, were strikingly beautiful. They
did not inherit this from their slatternly,
indolent mother or her people, who
lived in mill huts here and there on the
plateau, so it was generally assumed that
it was all a bit of a miracle; or that, hard
as it was to believe, Jim had once known
better things. He certainly planned bet-
ter things for Mary, who was doing her
probationary year in nursing, and Janey
for whom he dreamed one fantasy after
another.
On this particular morning the adum-
brate shadows of already dreamed
dreams lay quiescent as still pools in
his mind as he shared a huge pile of
toast and a billy of tea with the taciturn
young man a sort of Henry Fonda-
Glenn Ford who took over the day
shift care of the big boiler at the timber
mill. As usual there was no conversa-
tion until Jim hung his huge enamel mug
on a nail, planked the billy upside down
on the concrete floor, and turned to face
the sawdust-covered tram-track which
skirted the southern edge of the natural
plain.
“ ’Bye,” mumbled Jim. His head
sagged to one side. You could almost
imagine the breeze catching strands of
spittle from his lips and spinning it into
airborne tangles above a bullock waggon.
Then a startling thing happened. De-
parting from routine, his companion
said: “I hear that the new Sally bloke is
sweet on your eldest daughter.” Jim
looked indignant, but did not speak.
“And that next girl Janey, isn’t it?
She won’t be on your hands long. She’s
a real spanker.” Unwittingly the kernel
of his secret thoughts was exposed.
Instantly an expression, tender in spite
of its antagonism, gave Jim’s face an
unexpected dignity. “No man is getting
Janey till she’s had a chance to make
something of herself.” There was hosti-
lity, warning, finality in his tone.
“Then you wanta remember the boss’s
son got no time to waste on the usual
preliminaries, like,” was Ben’s blunt
retort.
The two men exchanged a brief sus-
picious glance; then Ben turned to the
boiler, and Jim crossed the tram-track
and set off over the plain of flowering
wild parsley.
On the other side of the plain stood
his house; a place of grey, unpainted
weatherboards and rusted roof, its tanks
plugged with floral, checked, striped and
spotted rags. Watched by some sca-
venging hens, he passed by the pensile
gate. One followed him into the bed-
room and contemplated him first with
one eye and then with the other as he
removed his boots. The odors of sawdust
and coal were fleetingly distinct, but
soon overpowered by the insuperable
mustiness of the room, for under the
cracked linoleum and in the dark, un-
swept, littered corners the myriads of
black wood lice were safely cloistered
between decaying wood and the charit-
able soil.
TTsually he feel asleep immediately;
but this day he lay under the grey
blanket and stared at the sun-spangled
pin-pricks in the limp green holland
blinds. It was then that the strange
stillness of the house beset him. He
raised his head a little from the striped
ticking of the bolster and listened. Thin,
plaintive and vibrant came the only
sound which dramatised the eerie still-
ness of a house accustomed to the bed-
lam of turbulent play and brawling
quarrels. He listened intently, and at
last decided that someone was crying
just one person, all alone, unmolested!
It was unbelievable!
In this lament there was none of the
usual boisterous satisfaction to which he
was immune; this was a weird keening
that accentuated his disquiet.
“What’s that infernal row?” he yelled.
The only reply was a squawk from the
pet magpie, which fluttered from the
verandah on to the handle of the well
pump. From his bed, the man could
see a small section of the rubbish-lit.
tered backyard and, outside the closed
kitchen door, several feet of the “L”.
shaped concrete verandah. Dilapidated
toys and boxes were scattered here, and
on the old sagging leather chair, its
springs draped like entrails, was a pile
of greyish napkins topped by two yawn-
ing kittens.
He got out of bed and stumped across
the corner of the yard to the kitchen
door. It did not swing evenly, and had
scored a deep groove in the floor, so
that he had to push hard against it to
open it. His family, gathered at the
clothless table, turned their eyes towards
him.
“What’s that infernal row? What are
you doing all cooped up in here with
the door shut? I’ve been yelling me
guts out.” There was exasperation but
not anger in his drawl. He looked around
the crowded table. “Where’s Janey?”
he asked, at once perturbed.
His wife, so fat that she enveloped
the chair seat like a cushion cover,
answered sourly: “That is your precious
Janey crying.” She thrust a pudgy hand
into the sagging neck of her frock and
tugged viciously at the shoulder straps
of her underwear. For a moment a
wide expanse of magnolia white accen-
tuated the mottled red “V” of her
weather-stained neck.
He was bewildered. “Crying where
why?”
“Up the pepper tree.”
“Why she crying?”
The woman pushed the chair back
and clip-flopped in her slippers to the
stove. In the hiatus between question
and answer, the crying wavered into the
kitchen. The two youngest children
began to whimper.
“Now I’ve had enough,” cried the
woman. “Come in and shut the door,
or git out and shut it, but don’t jist
stand there gaping like a codfish. She’s
an unnatural daughter and for all I care
she kin cry her eyes out. Insolent she
is and always will be, with her high and
mighty ideas. Who does she think she
is, telling me what I kin do and what


I’m not to, and forever criticising the
house and me. She thinks she kin force
me inter letting both of them stop in
town by saying she'll be the one to
stop home when she knows I’ll be thank-
ful to see the back of her.”
“Jimmy,” said the father, turning to
the eldest boy, who was about fourteen
but looked at least two years older. “Go
and get your sister out’f that tree.”
“Me and who else,” said Jimmy with
a smirk. “She’s got the flaming pepper
pot.”
“list wait till her ladyship gits hun-
gry,” snapped the mother. “Then she’ll
climb down from her perch.”
“Ho, ho, not her,” laughed Jimmy.
“She’d rather fall out dead.”
Charmian and Ramona, the twins, said
in chorus, “Mum says Mary hasta come
home when Janey goes inta town fera
job.”
“What’s all this about, anyway?” de-
manded the father. “I thought it was
all set.”
A drab sullenness made the woman’s
face sag wearily. She slumped into her
chair and began slapping fried eggs from
the huge pan on to the array of nine
plates. No one spoke. Jimmy whistled,
enjoying himself immensely. Harry
looked embarrassed; the twins giggled;
Millicent was puzzled and anxious; the
three small children were interested only
in the eggs, and banged their spoons
eagerly on the table.
“Feed Melinda,” commanded the
mother, passing a mashed-up egg to
Jimmy, who immediately ceased whist-
ling and tried to foist the plate on to
one of the twins, but without success.
“I said YOU,” commented the mother.
“Here, you squirt,” said Jimmy to
Melinda angrily. “Open your gob and
be quick about it.”
Suddenly the father yelled at the top
of his voice: “For the last time what’s
all this about?” He was so rarely angry
that they all gaped at him. The twins
twittered nervously, Millicent whimpered,
and Melinda slid under the table.
“Ask her yourself,” snapped his wife,
dropping the pan so carelessly on the
hearth stone behind her that the fat
slopped over, and in an instant the dog,
which had been lapping up the cats’
milk from the salmon tin, ran over and
sniffed eagerly.
QJumners crossed the yard to the pepper
tree, which stood in solitary splendor
behind the leaning lavatory. “Janey?”
he called tentatively.
There was no change in the crying.
He rubbed the sole of one foot across
the sooty instep of the other, and stared
unhappily into the foaming branches.
“Don’t be so silly, Janey,” he beseeched.
“Come down out’f there or I’ll come
up’n get you.”
The magpie, still on the well pump
handle and pecking irritably at the
splashes of dried porridge on its droop-
ing wing, looked up and squawked, its
eyes malicious.
Disconsolately the man looked over
the leaning fence. A quarter of a mile
away, across the gentle undulation of the
plain that lay like a saucer in the centre
of the timber belt, was the neat little
cottage where the bush nurse lived; and
coming past the cottage was the old but
spruce car owned by the young Salvation
Army officer.
“Janey,” called the man immediatelv,
in urgent tones, “here comes that Sally
bloke! Stop that crying like a good
girl. Come’n down and tell me what it’s
all about. What’ve they done? Go on,
that’s a good girl. Come’n down out'f
there before the Sally bloke gets here.”
There was not any movement in the
tree, nor did the crying abate.
The man, by now completely aroused,
walked in haste to the kitchen. “That
Sally bloke, what’s his name, is coming
up the road,” he said, concerned.
“It’s scripcher day hurray!”
chorused the twins. “We bags the front
seat.”
“Hooray, my foot,” mumbled Jimmy.
“You kids make me sick. So the whale
swallered Jonah. Like hell it did!”
FFhe mother, in a fluster, began to pin
A her dress at the bosom with one hand
and stack plates with the other. Then
she put the plates back on the table and
flopped against the back of the chair.
“KEEP THAT DOOR SHUT!” she
commanded.
Harry, the twins and Millicent began
gobbling their bread and jam so that they
would be finished in time to get a ride
to school. Jimmy did not intend to go
to school, so he proceeded in a leisurely
fashion to seek all the melon lumps in
the jam tin. v
The father appealed to the mother.
“You’ll have to go out and stop that
girl,” he said. “I don’t know what you
said to her but whatever it is you fix it
up before what’s his name gets here.
Mary wouldn’t like a commotion like
that going on while he's here.”
“I like that. Whatever I’ve done to
her, indeed. As far as I’m concerned
the impudent piece kin grow to the tree.
You stop her. You’re the one who’s re-
sponsible for spoiling her and giving her
big ideas. Where you git them from is
a wonder t’ me. You don’t waste any ’f
them on me. And let me tell you she
doesn’t think any the more of you for
all the spoiling and all. The only person
she cares two hoots about beside herself
is Mary. You don’t come inter the
picsher at all.”
The man stood irresolute for a mo-
ment, then hurried back to the bedroom,
where he pulled on his boots. “No time
f’ anything else,” he mumbled as he
heard the brisk steps of the Salvation
Army man coming around the verandah.
Smoothing his hair with the palm of his
hand, he left the room, carefully shut-
ting the door on the chaos within, and
went to meet the visitor.
IT'he young man was radiantly fair, his
face glowing as though it had just
been washed with iced water and rubbed
with a harsh towel. His sun-bleached
hair scintillated like hay.
“Good morning, Mr Sumners,” he
cried, shaking hands with enthusiasm.
He was so vibrant with vitality that as
he stood on the edge of the crumbling
cement he seemed poised on a diving-
board. It was as though the world was
a beckoning pool, and at any moment
one would see him flash into its exciting
embrace. “I just popped in to pick up
the children and to tell you that Mary
is well.” The words seemed newly
minted, spilling joyously. “She’s making
a first-rate nurse, Matron Brown tells me.
She’ll be off duty at the weekend, she
said, and will be home in the mail car
on Saturday. I’ll be up here conducting
services on Sunday and will give her a
lift back.” For a moment Sumners’ face
relaxed into sleepy contentment: then,
into the silence, Janey’s crying trickled
dismally.
The Sally bloke’s bright glance darted
to the pepper tree. The father began to
fidget. “Janey,” he said reluctantly. “It’s
been going on for a while now. Can’t
seem to stop it.”
“Then there’s nothing wrong with her
perseverance, is there?” cried the young
man cheerfully. “I don’t suppose I can
do any good if you can’t, but there’s
no harm trying, is there?”
Together they walked to the pepper
tree, the young man carefully ignoring
the squalor of the yard by keeping his
eyes fixed on the tree.
“Janey, Mary will be home for the
weekend. She says she is bringing you a
pretty jumper. And she has good news
for you from the Matron.”
There was no fluctuation in the crying.
It just went on and on. The two men
stood under the tree, Sumners doleful,
the young man persistently luminous.
The kitchen door opened and out
sped the twins. An unseen hand yanked
it shut. The children raced to the young
man, and then, pulling up suddenly,
stood twisting their hands and smiling
at him. He looked down at them, and
as he patted their heads he asked:
“Do you know why Janey’s crying?”
They giggled, and jigged on one foot.
“Not really. But p’raps it’s ’cause Mum

says Janey can go inter town and good
riddance, but Mary hasta come home.”
Alarm made the young man uneasy.
His shining armor was noticeably tar-
nished, and his face was left naked so
that one saw he was tender and vulner-
able and very young.
“Surely not!” He turned to the father.
His passionate zeal surmounted the tem-
porary anxiety as he hastened on. “Mary
has remarkable potentialities. She is so
happy, too, and is making the most of
her grand opportunity. I’m sure you
wouldn’t allow her to make such a sacri-
fice. No wonder Janey is so upset.”
The father, bewildered and wonder-
ing what was behind it all, gazed help-
lessly into the bright face as though
seeking strength to combat an unknown
foe; but it was like seeking reflections
in a polished mirror resolutely held to-
wards the sun: there was only this dis-
turbing brilliance that dazzled and could
not be shared.
“Mary’s too flaming soft,” came
Jimmy’s cocky voice. “As soon as she
finds out what’s cooking you’ll have a
tougher job stopping her coming back
than you had getting her to go. If you
don’t want her to come back to this
dump you better do something about it
pronto.”
rpHE group turned to look at Jimmy,
■*- lounging against a verandah post. At
the kitchen door, all trying to get through
at once, crowded Harry, Miilicent and
the two little girls. Brushing crumbs
,away and smearing jam over their cheeks
with the backs of their hands, Harry
and Miilicent both cried, “Kin I come
in front?”
“We were first,” yelled the twins.
They all jumped up and down in
front of the young man, their smeared
faces raised to his. Usually their hair
was brushed and combed by Janey, their
faces and hands washed; but today they
all looked as bedraggled as the magpie,
now sharpening its beak on the pump
handle.
The father shuffled uneasily. The
young man tried to smile. Jimmy,
champing noisily on the last of his
bread and jam, began rolling a cigarette.
After he had licked the paper, he spat
at, and hit, the magpie.
Above the chattering of the children,
still squabbling about the front seat, rose
Jimmy’s suggestive tones: “Why don’t
you and Mary get hitched and then Ma
can’t yank her home?”
The young man crimsoned, and the
father jerked his head in the direction
of the mill. “Hustle up and get to work.
You’re late already,” he said, angry at
last.
“Well, we all know he’s sweet on her.”
“Do as you’re told”, thundered the
father.
“Who? Me? Be your age. I’m not
goin’ t’ the mill no more,” announced
Jimmy calmly. “Now, t’day, well 1
think I’ll jist go out with me ferrets.”
The father, the young man, and the
now completely silent children, looked
at Jimmy. He was not a pleasant sight,
smoke trickling from his lips and nostrils,
his head lolling against the verandah post.
The young man cleared his throat,
and said with a constrained heartiness,
“Well, we better be off. Everyone ready?’’
“Tell your mother to comb your hair,”
said the father looking at the children
helplessly. His glance wandered to the
kitchen door, and there on the step the
baby was balancing precariously against
the closing door.
“Jimmy! Look sharp! Mind baby,” he
directed. “She’ll crack her head on the
concrete.”
Jimmy did not stir. He regarded the
baby with indifference. “She’ll have to
flaming well learn to look after herself
now another’s coming,” he said deri-
sively.
The twins began to giggle. Millicent’s
eyes lost their apprehension, and she ex-
claimed with excitement: “Oh, Mummy’s
going to have another darling baby.”
Jimmy looked at them with disgust.
He turned towards the back fence, and
as he slouched past his father he said
contemptuously, “Why don’t the pair of
you wake up to yourselves and learn a
thing or two, and then that big boob of
a Mary wouldn’t need Janey to cry her
eyes out.”
As though he were swimming under
water, the young man moved his arms
vaguely. The high dive that was to have
been so glorious had ended ignominously
in the weeds, and it seemed now that he
despaired of ever reaching the surface
to carry out his self-imposed rescue
work. With a great effort, he at last said,
“Well ... we better get on our way.
It's late.” In spite of his words, he did
not move, but stood staring at the
ground. Janey’s crying seemed to gain
impetus. Gradually it rose from a miser-
able whine to a desolate, heartbroken
wail. He raised his hands as though he
were going to cover his ears, but abrupt-
ly arrested the movement, and looking
into the tree, cried out: “Do please
stop, Janey! I’ll look after Mary!”
Slowly the crying abated. At last the
only sound was an occasional sniff.
“That’s a good girl, Janey,” said the
young man.
Through the branches the girl watched
the spruce old car go down the road.
Then she turned towards the mill, and
as her gaze lingered on the thin thread
of smoke coming from the boiler room
chimney, a smile curved into the un-
stained cheeks.


Around Melbourne
PENGUINS, PIES, AND MEGAPODES
In the US the majority of people
have never heard of our be-
loved Melbourne, never heard of the
MCG, Australian Rules or our dear
Yarra, but mention the State of
Victoria and their faces brighten
with pleasure. “Ah, that’s the
natural habitat for the Mallee Fowl.”
Yes, if we have nothing else over
here we have the Mallee Fowl, and
in the bird-watching business the
Mallee Fowl is a blue chip classic.
The secretary of our Bird Obser-
vers’ Club, Mr Roy Wheeler, is a
charming, indefatigable gentleman.
He says that we should realise bird
observers don’t merely number
thousands in the US; there are mil-
lions of them. (Mr Wheeler never
uses the term bird-watcher. It has
sunk into somewhat ill-repute lately.)
And they are coming out here in a
steady stream. They are not inter-
ested in Ayer’s Rock, the Harbor
Bridge or Colonel Light’s statue.
They’re interested in birds.
Money’s no object to these people,
according to Roy Wheeler; they’ll
pay anything to look at birds. Just
recently there was a Methodist
minister from New York who hired
a launch for £l2O just to look at
birds on Heron Island, Queensland.
A letter arrived this week from a
man in Arizona who wanted a com-
plete bird itinerary for October-
November, 1965. He will see 300
species. Then there’s Reg Denham,
the author-playwright. He came out
from the US with his wife, Mary
Orr, who plays the lead in “Never
Too Late” at the Comedy. Upon his
arrival Mr Denham said he had one
object on his visit —he wanted to
see Mallee Fowl.
In the Victorian bird hit parade
the lyrebirds at Sherbrook Forest
are, naturally, on top. Next comes
the Penguin Parade. This, fellow
observers, is really something. It
happens in the spring at Summer-
land Beach, Phillip Island, 85 miles
from Melbourne. Precisely at dusk
the penguins start to march out of
the water. Early in the season there
may be 150, but at the height of
breeding time they’re in vast numbers,
anything up to 2000. It has all been
nicely commercialised. There’s a
kiosk where observers can get soup
and hot pies. There are floodlights
shining down to the water and there
are fences to separate penguins from
humans. Then there’s music for all.
Heavens above, sometimes the
penguins march forth to the tune of
“Colonel Bogey”.
Next in order of popularity are
the Mallee Fowl, and that brings us
to the point of this story.
Fowl, like much of the wildlife in
this country, are in dire peril. For
some time now the Fisheries and
Wildlife Department has been fight-
ing to get them a special reserve.
Now the good news has come
through. The Acting-Premier, Mr
Rylah, has announced that he has
approved a 15,000-acre wildlife re-
serve in the parish of Wathe, near
Gama, about 70 miles from Mildura.
VTow, to put it mildly, the Mallee
Fowl is one of the marvels of
our time. It is a megapode; that is,
a bird which uses the heat of decay-
ing vegetation and sun to hatch its
eggs. No sitting on eggs for the
Mallee Fowl. Megapodes are purely
Australasian and the sole Victorian
megapode is the Mallee Fowl.
The fowl hatches the egg in a
mound which may be 23 feet across
and three to five feet high. This is
how it is done. You must under-
stand it is the male Mallee Fowl who
does all the work. He digs a hole in
the ground, then he goes round the
area stripping the Mallee scrub of
all vegetation. He puts this in the
hole and with the first rain it starts
to rot, producing heat. When the
temperature reaches 92 to 95 degrees
it is time for mother to lay eggs,
which she does at the rate of one
every four to five days.
But maintaining that 92-95 degrees
is hard labor. The Mallee nights are
deathly cold and days incubator hot.
So to maintain the heat overnight
the poor male has to shovel on a
great mound of earth. Then during
the day it has to shovel it off again to
keep the temperature steady. Mallee
Fowl have been known to start add-
ing earth even when a cloud goes
over the sun.
However, every fifth day, when
mother is ready to lay another of her
several dozen eggs, he has to dig out
the whole mound so that she can
lay it down below with the others.
According to the department experts,
the male Mallee Fowl does more
work than a Country Roads Board
navvy. The eggs take five to seven
weeks to hatch and when they do
the chickens are quite large.
At this stage, under many hundred-
weight of red Mallee soil, they’re on
their own. They have to scratch their
own way up to the surface. And so
they go off into the vast Mallee world
to gain their own education. Their
parents do nothing for them what-
ever. All that father does is to keep
the soil on top constantly scratched,
so that it is friable for when they
start burrowing.
So, as you can imagine, this is
marvellous for bird-observing. Roy
Wheeler says that the important thing
is to have a good hide. One makes
a hide out of poles and a square of
hessian with a hole for viewing. One
gets up before dawn and gets into
position for the long wait for the first
arrival of the fowl. When the birds
get used to the hide as just another
part of the landscape it is possible
to get nearer.
Of course, not all Mallee Fowl are
shy. Roy Wheeler says there are
two Mallee Fowl at Kiata, near Dim-
boola, who are so well known to the
tourists that Keith Hatley, the store-
keeper, calls them Romeo and Juliet.
So, carefully, we are now preserv-
ing our Mallee Fowl for the tourists
of the future. The painstaking
Fisheries and Wildlife Department
has been busy charting the location
of all the Mallee Fowl mounds and
it there are any in your area, say
from Bendigo north, they would love
to hear about it.

The Boom in Realism
Britain’s Establishment goes slumming
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Billy Liar. Director, John Schlesinger.
Embassy Theatre. Sydney.
The Victors. Director, Carl Foreman.
State Theatre. Sydney.
T>re-war English film-makers mostly
A concentrated on dramas and
comedies of high society. The lower
classes usually appeared as loyal,
comic retainers; working-class life was
rarely a subject for films, apart from
“inspirational” documentaries like “Drift-
ers” or an occasional Cockney comedy.
The seeds of social change were
already germinating, but up to 1939 they
could be ignored. The war put an
irreparable dent in class barriers —it was
such a different sort of war, with
officers and men drawn indiscriminately
from public and council schools; it even
involved civilians from every walk of
life.
England’s postwar social revolution
has, of course, been mirrored in films as
in literature and theatre. These days a
cook’s son is apt to be the hero of the
drama: a duke’s son and the son of a
belted earl come in (if at all) as comic
relief.
But the new realistic school of
English film-making cannot be un-
questioningly accepted as proof of the
destruction of social barriers. Its three
best-known exponents (Tony Richardson,
Karel Reisz and Lindsay Anderson) still
approach their subjects from the stand-
point of enlightened members of the
upper class, almost falling over back-
wards to prove their lack of class-
consciousness; and too often their films
have a specialised, in-group tone.
But there are genuine realists, notably
John Schlesinger, director of “Billy
Liar”. He is primarily interested in
people rather than the social revolution;
if he deals with characters from the
lower income groups it’s because he
finds something in them worth examin-
ing, not because he wishes to indicate
his own lack of snobbishness.
So “Billy Liar”, while it is a per-
ceptive but never condescending study
of provincial middle-class life, is essen-
tially a study of the kind of person to
be found in any society or class—who,
longing for wider horizons, is hemmed
in not by social or financial barriers but
by his own weakness.
Billy, resenting his dull life and in-
efficient at the normal processes of
daily living—he’s been caught pilfering
the office stamp money and has got
engaged to two girls though in love with
a third takes refuge in fantasies in
which he is the beloved and benevolent
dictator of the mythical Ambrosia. He
also dreams of being a brilliant success
in London.
Yet when he’s given a chance to
prove his superiority, Billy’s fear of the
unknown sends him back to the safe,
familiar unhappiness followed by the
loyal Ambrosian troops.
Schlesinger’s film is sharp but never
spiteful; it’s very funny indeed without
ever losing sight of the story’s essential
sadness.
sequences of Billy’s fantasies are
A beautifully handled; they are as solid
as the scenes of his real life, with only
the barest touch of exaggeration. The
intelligence of the direction, here as
always, is unobtrusive there is no
showy cleverness. Schlesinger was for-
tunate to have Tom Courtenay as his
star; his portrayal of the endearing,
maddening Billy is a satisfyingly com-
plete performance, which Courtenay has
realised thoroughly with both mind and
heart.
Carl Foreman, who has objected that
in other films his intentions were dis-
torted by outsiders, has no one but him-
self to blame for “The Victors”. He
wrote, produced and directed the film,
which he calls “my statement”.
Foreman wants us to know that no-
body ever wins in a war, and that war
brutalises and corrupts everyone it
touches. This thesis will scarcely come
as a surprise to most of us, but Foreman
announces it with the mingled excite-
ment and awe of one to whom has been
vouchsafed the solution of the riddle of
the universe, with a sure cure for cancer
thrown in.
He evidently fears that audiences may
miss his not too obscure point, so this
formless story of the experiences of a
group of Gls in Europe reiterates it
with tiresome over-simplification. Only
the sequence with Eli Wallach and
Jeanne Moreau rings true, because for
once Foreman forgets to sermonise and
without comment shows two incompa-
tible strangers driven together for com-
fort by loneliness and fear: here the
characters are allowed to talk and
behave like human beings instead of
set figures from a pacifist tract.
Foreman varies his high-minded senti-
mentality with heavy-handed irony for
instance, the interminable sequence of
the December execution of a deserter
is accompanied on the soundtrack with
“Have Yourself A Merry Little Christ-
mas”. Leave that sort of thing to
Stanley Kubrick, Mr Foreman you
don’t seem to have the knack.
Some of the performances are better
than the film deserves, but technically
the film, though professional, is un-
inventive. The exception is the imagina-
tive editing of the newsreel shots behind
the credit titles. These make Foreman’s
point far more tersely than the following
film does. Maybe he should have stopped
right there.
ART
Gleeson
James Gleeson. Recently at the John-
stone Gallery, Brisbane.
"Drisbane’s artistic appetite has recently
been whetted by several provocative
shows by artists who, though widely
acknowledged elsewhere, have not pre-
viously been seen here. Among them are
Maximilian Feuerring, Bob Dickerson
and currently the sophisticated, accom-
plished James Gleeson. His show at the
Johnstone Gallery—his major one this
year—is noteworthy, not merely for its
content, but also because it coincides
with the publication of his book on
William Dobell. These efforts, in con-
junction with his regular output of
astute art criticism, make it necessary to
list Mr Gleeson as one of the relatively
few really effective voices in Australian
art today.
All too often the term “surrealist” has
been attached to his work (a probable
hangover from the 19405). For while
this description is partially appropriate,
its connotation is too broad, and with
regard to this show more misleading
than enlightening. For instance, in this
exhibition Mr Gleeson does not set out


to break down or destroy any known
reality or system of association, but
nevertheless remains true to the surrealist
ideal by leaving his mind or fancy open
to unconventional forms —so creating
visions which are in no way traditional.
At the same time the artist partakes,
though certainly in an eccentric fashion,
of the seemingly-innate Australian ten-
dency to see landscape as a distinct,
active and personified force capable of
creating its own moods which any per-
ceptive person can interpret for him-
self.
Mr Gleeson’s choice of Greek myths
with their supernatural origins is com-
patible with this unique combination of
aesthetic ideals. The results are purely
individualistic reworkings of the various
myths that do justice to the artist’s
sensitivity and intellectual acumen. The
paintings are not larger than the average
book illustration and Mr Gleeson wisely
avoids the obvious pitfall of endeavoring
to make the gods yet bigger than their
usual image. Also their signs and
symbols are not emphasised. Even
Perseus bears Medusa’s not-too-snaky
head in a nonchalant manner, keeping
it from becoming for the millionth time
the centre of attention. In fact it is
the expansive, other-world panoramas,
not the figures to which prominence is
alloted. These give a sense of flight
and fancy to the scene frequently en-
gulfing the god, as in “The Flight of
Perseus”, or creating an atmospheric
curtain-like drop upon which the small
figures are centred as in “The Apotheosis
of Hercules”. In either case the freeness
of spirit and form is impressively por-
trayed. The artist uses a very thin
paint with which he frequently creates
colours that emanate light. All these
factors subtly encourage the viewer to
engross himself and associate his
private dreams with the paintings instead
of remaining rigidly within the known
story. Despite this quality the relation-
ship with the myths is never completely
obscured. The figures are, though in
small scale, the heroic nude bodies
associated with Greek gods and provide
a foil for the free-form color patterns
in which they exist. It is this discreet
but constant counterplay between
various elements coupled with a high
technical standard that gives the dif-
ferent series their beauty and fascination.
Although the few large abstract paint-
ings exhibited display a wider technical
range (though not a proficiency) than
their smaller counterparts, they lack
magic and the sense of fantasy that the
artist so ably tempers with intellectual
content in his portrayal of the myths.
It is unfortunate that these later qualities
are not replaced by any comparably
distinguished characteristics.

fkN her new Festival release, “Lover”,
Peggy Lee is in her best form for
some time, and Gordon Jenkins’ un-
pretentious, but accomplished, orchestra-
tions provide her with an ideal backing.
Wholeheartedly commercial they may
be, and purists are going to object, but
I prefer these rather routine string
arrangements to the more pretentious
small combo sounds usually to be found
on a Lee record. “You Go To My
Head,” almost as good as the Dietrich
version, and a sad little number about
a lost lover, “That’s Him”, are impec-
cably sung. Peggy Lee can make even
the most moonstruck lyrics sound
sensible.
In “Mink Jazz” she is back with a
rhythm section and an unwonted sleeve
spiel by David Cavanaugh, executive pro-
ducer of Capitol Records. The (Holly-
wood, Calif.) recording is delicately
balanced, the singing especially of “I
Could Write A Book” delectable, but
the numbers, with one or two exceptions,
are a trifle hackneyed to justify the
full-scale “jazz” redecoration. Justin
Gordon’s beautifully light and buoyant
flute-playing is particularly striking on
“The Lady Is A Tramp”. Leslie Uggams
is not nearly as subtle a singer as Peggy
Lee, but she makes up for that in
vitality, drive, and an exultant femin-
inity. Her “Tenderly” is second only to
India Adams’ version in my recollection,
and her “Smoke Gets In Your Eyes”—
though scarcely likely to evoke nostalgia
in the hearts of those who lived through
the early 1930 s has a nice, bright,
’sixties sound.
And now, hesitantly, to Miss Streisand.
She is the widest-ranging of the popular
vocalists, zooming up and down one
and three-quarter octaves while most
singers cling to a precarious half of one.
Her throat opens and she goes at it
fierce, fast and unsubtle. Nobody works
harder than she does, mangling the
lyrics, upsetting the rhythm, selling
everything down the river to give herself
the fullest possible scope. The most
relentless personality-pusher since the
early Ethel Merman, she is the loudest
thing we heard since last passing a
drill-team. She is the star of “Happy
Girl” on Broadway, looks marvellous,
has a brilliant Press agent, and has made
the “Time” cover. Everyone has decided
she is the greatest thing to happen in
show business, so who am I to quibble?
Raymond Massey’s gruff voice read-
ing Tennyson is much more up my
street. The fierce, honest actor of “Abe
Lincoln in Illinois”, “The Fountainhead”
and “Things to Come” excellently
renders “The Lotos Eaters” (incorrectly
spelt on the record-sleeve), getting just
that languid, exhausted dying fall into
the final stanzas one looks for in vain
in so many recitations. His slightly
monotonous Canadian voice is admirably
unactorish; this is the only way to read
poetry, without affectation, simply and
straightforwardly, like a man talking to
men. ABC actors, please note. The
Kermit Bloomgarden and Walter Fried
production of “Death of a Salesman”,
with the original Broadway cast, has
again made it to Australia on a Festival
re-pressing, and it’s very welcome:
Miller’s ruthlessly honest demolition of
the American Dream retains, even when
heard for the third time, and after a
good many examinations of the screen
version, its mounting power. The per-
formances of Arthur Kennedy, Mildred
Dunnock, Thomas Mitchell and Cameron
Mitchell are never less than great.

wrong reasons. But from what must
have been a pretty disheartening ex-
perience all round, the serial’s team may
have learnt that viewers who are too
knowledgeable after “Ben Casey” for
knife-and-fork surgery are too know-
ledgeable after “Maigret” for a thriller
which doesn’t hang together anywhere.
“The Purple Jacaranda” began in
low gear by revealing who the villains
were. However, at the end of Episode
Four, it was still not clear what their
plot involved. Some people, employed
by the Federal Treasury, intended to
use advance information on Australia’s
revaluation of her currency to profit
by it. Security services are aware of
this and persuade a Perth journalist,
Anne James, to go to Jacaranda House,
Manly, NSW, the home of a friend of
hers and the place where the plot is
being masterminded.
It wouldn’t be necessary to go deep
into the financial pages to know that it
is impossible now for anyone to make
any substantial movement of currency
without the Central Bank being aware of
it, asking you your reasons and stopping
you if it chose. Currency manipulation
nowadays seems limited to hoarding Mr
Holt’s pennies or bringing back low-
value coins from overseas to use in
parking meters. If there were a re-
valuation of Australia’s currency up-
ward, there would be some fairly
sophisticated moves, such as trading in
wool futures, but all movements of
money would be watched carefully at
such a time. None of these manipula-
tions are illegal in themselves, although
it would be highly unethical of a
Treasury official to make any use of
prior information.
If the scriptwriter has some cards up
his limp sleeve and subsequent episodes
do reveal —no doubt to the vast interest
of Mr Holt and Sir Roland Wilson
that such moves can be made, why
would Security be involved? We in the
outside world hear that people in the
ABC are very conscious of surveillance,
and this possibly makes them think
Security is everywhere. However, cur-
rency offences are dealt with in NSW
by the Fraud Squad, with perhaps help
from Interpol, and, one would think,
help from Security only if a foreign
power were involved.
In small ways, too, “The Purple
Jacaranda” is inaccurate in observation.
One incident involves a cigarette case.
The flip-top box and the king-size filter
have left thousands of silver cigarette
cases tarnishing in lowboys.
With the material provided, it is point-
less to talk of performances. Perhaps
the most harshly treated is Margo Lee.
In the first episode she was a young
woman intelligent enough to be asked
to shadow dangerous criminals. Since
then she has represented simpering
stupidity. Miss Lee still wears a look
of pained surprise at this perfidy on the
part of the scriptwriter.

Priest
Becket. Jean Anouilh. Independent
Theatre, Sydney.
“¥>ecket” has already been produced
■*“* in Melbourne and Canberra, and a
film has recently been made of it with
Richard Burton and Peter O’Toole.
Anouilh’s play is mainly concerned
with the personal relationship between
Henry II and Becket, but these characters
bear little resemblance to the originals.
Becket becomes a Saxon, protecting the
virtue of Saxon maidens and champion-
ing the cause of Saxon underdogs
against their cruel Norman overlords. In
reality it was the other way round.
Henry 11, as King of England, was try-
ing to defend his secular power against
the Roman Catholic Church and its
ardent champion Thomas a Becket, who
was, of course, of Norman descent.
In this play Thomas a Becket has
become a romantic hero and Henry II a
weak, bored King, who is always bicker-
ing with his royal family, just like you
or me or the people in the television
serials. Both these characters are pretty
largely products of Anouilh’s imagina-
tion, and the story, although it has a
framework of fact, is almost pure
romance.
Fortunately the play is partly re-
deemed by its comedy: from the broad
satire of the scenes in which a benign
King Louis of France candidly explains
real-politik to an amused Becket, to the
pure farce of the interview between the
Pope and a Cardinal, in which they
warily try to out-manoeuvre each other
in the manner and broken accents of a
couple of wily greengrocers. These
scenes produce two very good comic
performances, both done with quiet
restraint, by A 1 Thomas as the Pope
and John Gray as Louis of France.
Mark McManus gives an impressive
performance as the charming Becket.
But John Unicomb’s excessively un-
attractive Henry II seemed overdone.
Doris Fitton graces the production with
a regal Queen Mother.
This production by Robert Levis,
although it does some things better, lacks
the high finish of Irene Mitchell’s pro-
duction at St Martin’s in Melbourne.

Voyage to the Pagan Isles
The austere vision of James McAuley
By R. G. GEERING
Captain Quiros. James McAuley.

The Ghost of the Cock. Francis
Webb. Angus & Robertson. 17s. 6d.
The Living Sky. Alexander Craig.
Angus & Robertson. 17s. 6d.
Tn a poem about John Smith, a retired
* lighthouse-keeper, Alexander Craig
writes:
You can send
His thoughts afar, make him a kind
of symbol
Of anything you wish—of human life,
Of dangerous voyages, de Quiros,
Cook
And man’s Endeavour foundered . . .
He won’t care.
The Portuguese Quiros was enough of
a saint to be a symbol in his own right
and as such takes his place naturally at
the centre of James McAuley’s long-
awaited poem. Whereas many of the
Spanish adventurers of the time went in
search of fame, worldly goods, and
national glory (their religious motives,
at best, merely to forestall the apostate
Protestants), Quiros was an idealist bent
solely on winning the Southern Conti-
nent for Christ. He vowed to carry
through his task without bloodshed, to
drive men on by love, not fear. Mc-
Auley’s well-known “Terra Australis”
refers to Quiros’ vision and strikes the
note of the inward journey; this narrative
of approximately 2000 lines, like some
of its distinguished predecessors in Aust-
ralian verse, is a poem of spiritual as
well as physical discovery and, accord-
ingly, sees the events it re-creates in the
perspectives of both past and present.
The Proem to Part One, which deals
with Quiros’ first journey to the Pacific,
as Pilot and then as Master with Men-
dana in the discovery of the Solomons,
introduces Belmonte as poet and story-
teller. Part One, ironically titled “Where
Solomon Was Wanting”, describes Men-
dana’s attempted colonization twenty
years later —the bloodshed in the deal-
rags with the natives, the bickerings
among the leaders, culminating in fight-
>ng between the whites themselves.
Quiros checks some of the worst excesses
■hat threaten but the venture still ends in
disaster.
Part Two, “The Quest For The South
Land”, describes Quiros’ own voyage in
1605, his naming of a large island in the
New Hebrides Australia Del Espiritu
Santo, the abandonment of the New Jeru-
salem, and the break-up of the fleet,
Torres sailing east and Quiros west to
Mexico. Part Three, “The Times of the
Nations”, recounts Quiros’ final attempt,
in the face of political opposition, to
launch another expedition, his frustra-
tion, and his death seven years later in
Panama.
Quiros’ failure to push east and dis-
cover the Southern Continent (a
subject of historical debate which some-
times puts him in a less attractive light)
is accounted for here by his illness and
the confusion consequent upon the split-
ting of the command. Quiros, nonethe-
less, is given his doubts. On the return
journey to Mexico he asks the dying
friar why they have merited no more
from Heaven and is told that perfection,
itself beyond the reach of man, is a kind
of temptation. The poem ends with
Quiros’ vision, as he dies, of the actual
discovery of the South Land and its
colonization; his final words are:
And from our broken toil may you
inherit
A vision to transform your latter days.
In the earlier “A Leaf of Sage”
McAuley saw himself as the poet who,
“truant to good advice”, was returning
to the lost art of narrative; in this more
elaborately-planned poem Belmonte de-
velops the justification of his task, con-
cluding the Proem to Part Two with his
determination
To hold the difficult height of the
sublime.
This is not to say that the poet
makes the mistake of trying to remain
on the heights all the time. The narra-
tive tempo slackens between the peak
events and further variations occur when
Belmonte dwells on a description or
pauses to reflect; the points of rest as,
for example, when Quiros fails to divert
Mendana from his vengeance at Graci-
osa Bay and is left to hug his vision in
isolation, serve to heighten the tension
to come, to prepare us for the appalling
consequences of human commitments
and
The ambiguities that sap the heart.
Within the framework of his regular
seven-line stanzas McAuley achieves a
freedom and fluidity that are the mark
of the mature poet who can accept a
formal discipline and turn it to artistic
account. It is such a lovingly-wrought
work of art that the very occasional
lapse stands out all the more as, for
instance, the unexpected flatness of the
rhythm in
By the third day we had lost so much
ground
We were some thirty leagues to the
north-west.
The prevailing tone of “Captain
Quiros”, despite the violence of certain
scenes, is grave and calm, even austere;
some readers may find it too cold for
their liking. But there can, finally, be
no doubt that in concept and execution
this is one of the finest things of its kind
in Australian poetry.
Francis Webb is a very different sort
of poet —sometimes in this latest volume
of his he seems Dionysus to McAuley's
Apollo. “The Ghost of the Cock” takes
its title from a radio verse play in which
Michael and Tobias come down to
earth to rescue a man and a woman, sole
survivors of an atomic war. Condemned
by the animals for his hatred towards
all living creatures man is saved by the
cock's plea and, in the end, forgiven.
This is the longest (but not the most
ambitious) of the pieces in this volume
and the best sustained. The dominant
impression created by most of the other
poems (an impression sharpened as we
come to them from the lucid, controlled
grace of McAuley’s verse) is one of in-
tense feeling in an agonised struggle
for expression. The reader, for his part,
has to struggle also in waves of turgid,
cryptic imagery such as:
Conscience of the late tractor that
straddled cloud,
Was hammer on nailhead, jogs into
dozing rumor
Along the sacred stolid flanks of land.


And
Bells of morning sounding, schedules
tumbling:
Peers the white calculus
At his certain opera of grass.
One is reminded of the early verse of
Dylan Thomas, in which the language
has somehow to be got round instead
of seen through, to come at the experi-
ence that lies behind it.
The two main sequences are “Around
Costessey”, which sounds the religious
note, and “Ward Two”, in which the
poet’s preoccupation with suffering en-
genders a compassion for the lonely and
the lost, tempting him
To see in ugliness and agony a way
to God.
The humor and irony that Webb
commands so well in his earlier verse are
less evident in this volume. The achieve-
ments of “A Drum for Ben Boyd” and
“Leichhardt in Theatre” suggest that he
writes best when he is able to objectify
his feelings through character and scene.
There are some fine touches in the dra-
matic monologue “Brahms at Bruckner’s
Funeral”, there is an achieved power in
certain of the “Ward Two” poems
(which, indeed, are obscure enough in
places) and, again, in “Legionary Ants”,
but much of this collection labors under
the weight of its intractable material and
falls short of the realisation it strains
after.
“The Living Sky” is a selection of
poems by Alexander Craig, written over
the last decade. It contains a few
sharp etchings of American university
life, some satirical extracts in heroic
couplets, a group entitled “New Poems
1962-3”, and a mixed bunch, perhaps
the most attractive in the volume,
“Landscapes and People”, which in-
cludes a praiseworthy attempt through
accurate translation to capture in Eng-
lish something of the verbal music of
Valery’s “Le Cimetiere Marin”.
Craig’s talents are seen to best ad-
vantage most often in descriptive pieces
like “Landscape”, a poem of genuine
lyrical power which provides the title
for the volume, “Hillside” and “The
Laurenziana Chapel”. The “New
Poems”, except for “Sea at Portsea”, are
disappointing; “On the Cosmic High-
way” is up-to-date in its space-age
imagery but it never recovers from its
rather trite opening
Our Father Which art in hydrogen
held in our cylinders of centuries
and never succeeds in yoking the old
and the new.
One of the surprises (coming towards
the end and quite unlike any of the
other poems in this volume) is the very
funny fable “The Silver Screw”, which
goes to show that you don’t have to be
deadly serious to produce something
worthwhile.

to damn it at the outset as dull. It says
a great deal for William Trevor’s talent
to be able to report that “The Old Boys”,
though built around this very situation
and with every main character over
seventy, is a first novel of exceptional
readability, one which touches the heart
while activating the funny-bone. Mr
Trevor is Irish, but his prose has that
same very British precision which one
relishes (to the point where subject mat-
ter ceases to be important) in Anthony
Powell and Evelyn Waugh.
Jaraby, Sole, Cridley, Nox, Turtle,
Swabey-Boyns, Sanctuary and Ponders
form the committee of a public school’s
Old Boys’ Association. Jaraby expects
to replace Ponders as the next president
but Nox, once Jaraby’s ill-treated fag,
plots elaborately to thwart him. Genteel
but intolerant, Jaraby is evidently inten-
ded to represent an extreme product of
an anachronistic education system, the
absurdity and viciousness of which is
tellingly pointed up by some amusing
flashbacks and a priceless description of
Old Boys’ Day.
It is while Jaraby is attending this
Day at the old school that his long-
suffering wife murders his outsize cat,
Monmouth, so that their compulsively
delinquent son, also an Old Boy now
aged forty, can return home with his
budgerigars. Jaraby’s arguments with his
wife (each thinks the other mad) pro-
vide some of the book’s most brilliant
dialogue.
While it is Jaraby’s affairs which form
the main thread of the novel, we are
treated to some delightfully droll, dead-
pan excursions into the first and second
childhoods of the other committee mem-
bers. Humorous writing about elderly
people runs the risk of being labelled
“sick”. In “The Old Boys”, if much
of the comedy rises out of the failings of
mind and body, it is handled with a
gravity and courtliness which averts all
possibility of offence. Comic writers
like William Trevor are rare. I eagerly
await his next book.
As booksellers and librarians in par-
ticular can testify, Mr Victor Gollancz
is nothing if not an enthusiastic pub-
lisher; his blurbs and his announcements
of forthcoming books are famous in the
trade for their length and extravagance.
Sometimes, to read the book itself is
redundant! I am not objecting to this:
Mr Gollancz may rave on a bit but his
sincerity usually shines through. For
Winifred Wilkinson’s belatedly-published
first novel, “God in Hell”, he has writ-
ten a typical foreword in which he
mentions that Mrs Wilkinson’s manu-
script arrived with a commendatory let-
ter (printed, in part, on the jacket) from
authoress Storm Jameson. He tells how
each of his four readings left him more
moved and ends with the familiar state-
ment: “I have been a publisher for
forty-two years, but can think of no
book that I have published with greater
happiness.”
I would agree with Miss Jameson and
Mr Gollancz that “God in Hell” has
many virtues. Its theme —the horror
and suffering which follow in the wake
of war—cannot be repeated too often.
It is compassionate. It is imaginative
in its detail. Noble thoughts abound.
Unfortunately, it is also tedious: the
style is repetitive and labored, at times
as awkward as a poor translation; while
the series of coincidences which serve
as a plot and the long, moralising mono-
logues can only be called amateurish.
Stanislaw is a fifteen-year-old Polish
war-waif become amoral and almost
animal in his struggle for survival. He
is given shelter by a remarkable peasant
woman and from this point the story is
concerned largely with her efforts to
rehabilitate the boy and restore his faith
in humankind.
Worth reading for its message but, in
spite of what he says, Mr Gollancz has
published much better novels.

'Brahminism and the “untouchables” in
and ever a thorn in everybody’s
’side from the Year One onwards. They
(gave the British a great deal of trouble
towards the end of the eighteenth cen-
[ tury and they operate a matriarchal
I system which seems to have subordi-
nated even Khrishna Menon’s very for-
midable lawyer and rich landlord
f father, a leading counsel who “loved
elephants” —an evidence of his social
status which stemmed from a Rajah’s
entourage in Travancore.
There is something very Irish about
Keralans whose motto seems to have
' always been “Down with everybody and
to hell with the rest”. And Menon is a
good specimen, who would be described
in Chicago, perhaps, on his record as a
“mixed up kid”. Being born a Northern
Nair by origin through his father, in
Southern Kerala, of a cultured southern
'mother, was something like being the
son of a County Down Cromwellian
immigrant born in Cork of a devout
Catholic mother, with the obstinacy of
the southern Irish in her. And when
on to a Nair nature recreant from caste
observance was grafted the sponsorship
.of Annie Besant and the persuasive
socialism of the London School of Eco-
nomics as expounded by Harold Laski,
the result was something to see.
England saw in Menon a rich invert
who exiled himself in devotion to the
ideal of becoming a European agitator
for the social revolution. His ambitions
pushed him into the leadership of the
*Left wing of the St Pancras Branch of
the Labor Party (which was very Leftist
indeed!) and of the St Pancras Borough
Council, a would-be British parliamen-
tarian who forsook his own customs and
could not speak more than a smattering
of the languages of his own country
.and was so English that he could be a
founder editor of the Pelican books.
He, however, kept his inferiority com-
plex and decided that all political oppo-
sition must be due to the color of his
skin. He always seemed to be on the
side to which he did not belong: a Left-
.wing democrat who shouted at Indian
watchmen in English and then had to get
his secretary to interpret his apologies;
an Indian nationalist who did not under-
stand the Hindi which his own govern-
ment desired to turn into the national
parliamentary language of India; an
(Indian on the side of the Communists; a
pacifist who was perpetually aggressive;
an ardent publicist who perennially
abused the Press, especially the section
which opposed him—“the jute press”.
He seems, indeed, to be a hag-ridden
character who lives on biscuits and tea,
a vegetarian, teetotaller and non-smoker,
and sometimes almost non-sleeper.
While he was Minister for Defence of
India, he lived in a corner of his palace
m a small room crowded with electric
and electronic gadgets and toys that re-
acted to the touch of a button. He is
sedulous as a reader of detective stories,
an addict of Savile Row at its most
meticulous, with the wardrobe of a
movie star, an elusive ministerial Pim-
pernel who thought nothing of leaving
India to go to the United Nations “for
the weekend”. As an internationalist,
he professes a yearning for world unity
and brotherhood but, as Mr James
writes, “he has divided humanity into
two opposing camps—the pro-Menon
and the anti-Menon camps”. He is a
paradox who might well have led India
into very devious paths through his
advocacy of Afro-Asian unity. And
he fell from office ultimately when he
went too far even for Nehru and other
“non-aligners” in his proposal to the
Indian Cabinet to lease the Aksai Chin
salient in Ladakh in return for a Com-
munist Chinese lease of territory be-
tween Bhutan and Sikkim. He is still
an influence in India and he apparently
still yearns for power which easily could
become his in the period in which Nehru
is finally off the scene. He is probably
still the most dynamic figure in Indian
politics today.
It is certain that Nehru would not
have had him in his Cabinet as long as
he did if he had not commanded very
strong popular support.
Mr James's book, while to some extent
apologist and sometimes marked by
special pleading, is one which it would
pay every Australian interested in South
East Asia’s immediate future to read. It
may become very vital to understand the
workings of the Menon mind.

Portrait of Myself. Margaret Bourke-
White. Collins. 375. 3d.
HThe danger inherent in photographers’
autobiographies is that their pictures
often render their words insipid or
superfluous. Margaret Bourke-White’s
“Portrait of Myself”, though simply and
even conservatively written, escapes this
trap; as well as being a photographer
whose work for “Life” magazine is
known throughout the world, she is also
extremely articulate and possessed of a
rare insight which enables her to distil
the essence of a subject into a frame
of celluloid.
When Margaret Bourke-White emer-
ged from college with some experience
of the infant science of photography, her
artistic sense made her one of the first
to sense an innate beauty in the burgeon-
ing industrial complexes throughout the
United States. The limitations of her
craft, the large and clumsy cameras,
slow film emulsion speeds and flash
powder, seemed only to increase her
certainty of success and, though there
were some lean periods, the reputation
she built as an industrial photographer
seemed the natural result of her efforts.
But it was when she began her asso-
ciation with “Fortune” and subsequently
“Life” that her dedication really began,
when she began to say of herself “I am
a photographer” the way a priest might
say “I am a priest”. Margaret Bourke-
White’s career with “Life” was a love-
affair which eclipsed all others. She
makes no secret of the fact that her
marriage to Erskine Caldwell born of
a tour of the Southern States during
which they collaborated on a book and
negotiated by telegram while she was


on a “Life” assignment in the Arctic
Circle —would never be allowed to inter-
fere with her work. Her association with
“Life” by far outlasted the marriage and
the success of magazine and photo-
grapher went hand in hand. As a “Life”
photographer, she has covered all the
major and most of the minor wars. She
has been caught in air raids and has been
torpedoed, narrowly avoiding missing her
place in a lifeboat because she was taking
pictures.
In a sense Miss Bourke-White is also
symbolic of female emancipation in the
United States. There is more than a
touch of suffragette bravado about the
familiar pictures of her hanging from
the under-belly of a plane taking pic-
tures or balanced precipitately on the
parapet of a building 800 feet high. She
insists that she wanted no special treat-
ment because she was a woman, but
nevertheless she made a conscious effort
to keep the fact of her femininity
apparent. In her earliest photographic
assignments in factories she wore
ensembles to match her camera cloths
and maintained a card file so that she
would not repeat a color scheme. When
she photographed Stalin in the Kremlin
she carefully chose red shoes and a red
ribbon because “Russians like red”; and
after being torpedoed she grieved about
the loss of a cosmetics case while clutch-
ing the camera she had saved.
“Work to me is a sacred thing”, Miss
Bourke-White says and even when she
was afflicted with the seemingly-
incurable Parkinson’s disease, she re-
fused to allow the creeping paralysis to
affect her work. In her efforts to defeat
the disease she applied the same prin-
ciples that had guided her life —hard
work, optimism and a refusal to accept
defeat. A measure of her confidence of
overcoming the disease was that she
applied for and was promised “Life’s”
first assignment to the moon, whenever
that event may be possible.
In her illness, also, time was her
ally and the disease was arrested by new
surgical techniques emerging at precisely
the required moment. Miss Bourke-
White has written, “By great good for-
tune I am born in the right century, in
the right decade, and even in the right
group of months to profit from the swift-
running advance of modern medical
science ... By some special gracious-
ness of fate I am deposited—as all good
photographers like to be—in the right
place at the right time.” It will serve
as an apt epitaph.

Raking Muck
Deepwater Siding. Norma Martyn.
Cassell (Australia). 275. 6d.
Scandal in Eden. Garet Rogers. Put-
nam. 265. 6d.
the Australian branch of an
" eminent British publishing house
puts out a first novel by an Australian
writer we are justified in looking for
something positive. But, presented with
a novelettish hodge-podge of rape, im-
plied incest, abortion, mayhem, murder
and suicide, written in labored, cliche-
ridden form and with no discernible
character delineation, just what is there
to say?
Miss Martyn takes us to a sleepy
country town. And are we surprised to
find all is not harmony, brotherly love
and respectability? Indeed we are not.
We’ve met these sleepy country towns
before. At least Miss Martyn doesn’t
keep us guessing about “Deepwater
Siding”. On the first page we meet the
town’s leading citizen speculatively
watching his dim-witted daughter go
through the paroxysms of morning sick-
ness and deciding she must be pregnant
and that he is responsible. Later, we
are reassured slightly. The girl is
adopted so the crime is lessened some-
what.
Drunks, lechers, whores, nympho-
maniacs all totter through the 222 close-
type pages. Never do the characters
come to life and how can we believe in
a country pub owner who soliloquizes
thus?
“Lunny thing about cities. There
seems to be so much of everything there
and yet you can spend a lifetime looking
for something and never finding it.
Everybody rushing around and search-
ing for something. In the end they
forget what it was they wanted. Or get
so tired out from looking they don’t
want it any more if they do find it . . .
In the country you can let life flow over
you and often in the quiet flow you can
find peace.”
Only a sense of duty kept me at it to
the final page. With the best will in the
world I could find nothing to commend
in this trashy, totally incredible book.
“Scandal in Eden” is another book
which might be termed “muck-raking”.
Here we have the case of an early
Hollywood gargantuan accused of caus-
ing the death of a soi-disant starlet as a
result of an orgy in a third-rate hotel
cunningly named “Eden”.
The immediate impulse is to handle
this book with tongs and wave away the
odoriferous fumes that seem to be rising
from between its covers.
There are no four-letter words (al-
though Miss Rogers does use two letters
of a well-worn favorite) and the events
are related more by innuendo than
clinical description. The heavyweight
comedian, based obviously on the late
“Fatty” Arbuckle, is impotent, but this
doesn’t lessen his lascivious excursions.
His victim has been taken to a private
nursing home where a “passed” Negro
doctor aborts her, although she sub-
sequently succumbs to septicaemia due
to a puncture of the birth canal.
Was death caused by the abortion or
some sexual assault perpetrated before
the girl was brought to hospital? This
is the crux of the court case which
features a drunken lawyer, a former
lover of the victim.
The entire cast of characters is un-
savory in the extreme. The lawyer, at
a low ebb, is hired by a producer anxious
to protect his valuable star’s popularity.
We are taken over the events of the wild
night at Eden seen from a variety of
viewpoints. Confusing flashbacks whisk
us to the earlier years of the ambitious,
film-struck girl.
A witness is clobbered and given a
broken jaw to shut her up. A retired
lesbian stunt woman is introduced and
the anti-hero strides through the pages
as obnoxious a character as one would
hope to avoid.
If parts of the narrative tend to curl
one’s toes the book comes thrillingly to
life in the court scene where, whatever
we may impugn from her choice of
subject, Miss Rogers excels as a racy,
brilliant writer when talking about some-
thing she obviously knows well the
California court of law.
Miss Rogers, the dust jacket tells us,
was a practising lawyer who once stood
as mayoral candidate for the City of
Los Angeles. She was defeated.
Inevitably, one compares these books,
with their involvement in the baser
motives and practices of men and
women, to those that have come under
the censors’ heavy hands lately.
“Fanny Hill” acquires pristine purity
in her totally disarming boudoir acro-
batics by contrast. The wholly contextual
obscenities in “Another Country” have
an adult justification relevant to a
moving story of an obsessed Negro. Yet
these are forbidden us and all that these
two ladies imply in their books is con-
sidered valid reading.
I am not suggesting that the censor
takes another look at these two. The
former is so naive that its narrative
becomes unimportant. The latter is the
type of book travelling salesmen buy
to while away a lonely night in a strange
hotel.
Both writers beam their self satis-
faction at us from the dust jackets. Both
appear to be well groomed, wholesome
types and both wear pearls.

to April, 1964, and annually since 1960-61.
the Treasury’s not raising the coupon rate too high but meet-
ing the market by adjusting its issue price and offering the
new loan at a discount an important political consideration
when State housing loans are tied to the coupon rate instead
of the redemption rate.
The Commonwealth Government thus seems increasingly
wedded to the flexible interest rate weapon, demonstrated by
the effectiveness of Reserve Bank control. Nonetheless it
must remain sensitively tuned to the market, because there
is some extensive loan raising still to be achieved (despite past
successes) if the higher budgets for defence, housing, works,
etc., are to be met.
Even so, the commitments outlined by the Prime Minister
since his overseas trip appear difficult to finance without some
increase in taxation.
Japan will Mount Major
Export Drive
Australia, among a host of other countries, may soon be
facing the onslaught of an accelerated export programme
by Japan. The drive will be quite independent of the ambiti-
ous scheme to set up an Organisation for Pacific Economic
Co-operation, which is apparently to be discussed between Aus-
tralian and Japanese businessmen in September.
Renewed exporting vigor must undoubtedly take its cue
from the Japanese International Trade and Industry Ministry’s
latest White Paper on foreign trade. This, curiously enough
to most ears, sounds very worried that export growth has slip-
ped from a 1953-59 yearly rate
of 17 p.c. to 12 p.c. a year in
1959-63.
The White Paper spells out
the general lesson clearly if
prosily: “The balance-of-pay-
ments problem facing Japan to-
day stems basically from the
balance -of - payments pattern
that has taken shape in the
course of economic expansion.
. . . The economic structure
should be so changed as to en-
hance the role of export trading
in the national economy, with
a view to correcting the pay-
ments pattern.”
Throughout the White Paper
there breathes a hearty respect
for West Germany’s accom-
plishments. Japan’s exports
represented 12 p.c. of the in-
crease in aggregate demand
during 1953-1962; in West Ger-
many exports represented 29
p.c. “This testifies to the fact


that export trade played a leading role in the economic growth
of that country.”
A further official goad is likely to spur Japanese industry.
Despite the recurrent imbalance, the Minister of Finance, Mr
Kakuei Tanaka, has just committed himself to the opinion
that international payments can be balanced by the close of
the present financial year, March 31 next.
Mr Tanaka’s forecast strikes many commentators as far too
optimistic, since earlier predictions reckoned on a £7O million
deficit. He defends himself, though, by pointing to recently
improved exports and surprisingly favorable capital incomings.
The Bank of Japan’s tight money policy appears to have
encouraged exports while levelling imports. Certainly June
saw a record export figure and, though imports also went
higher, the monthly credit balance was the second highest since
the war.
Yet the January-June half-year produced the worst trade
gap in the post-war period. Some fortitude, and rational
planning, could be needed to validate the Fuji Bank’s belief
that the upward export trend should last for about two more
years and that the monetary squeeze might be lessened by
September (around the time of the International Monetary
Fund’s Tokyo meeting).
Australians shouldn’t need much reminding of their position
in the Japanese picture, particularly in the light of Japan’s
huge wool purchases. The heat will be on particularly in
heavy industrial and chemical products, now comprising more
than half Japan’s total exports.
Larke Consolidated’s recently signed franchise may also be
taken as a foretaste of things to come. A newly-formed Larke
subsidiary, Lewis Prince Ltd, will be sole importer and distri-
butor of shipments of some 300 motor vehicles a month from
the Prince Motor Company, of Japan. Local assembly of some
800-1000 units a month is planned after about a year.
Eating Cereal Pie at the
Kennedy Round
As forecast, the Kennedy plan for trade expansion in Europe
has been shelved, or at least toned down to ineffective
talks. Less politely, it might be said that it was torpedoed
by self-interest. It is now doubtful if any decisions will be
made before the US elections, while the West Germans
say they are unwilling to create an agricultural crisis prior
to their own elections next year.
West Germany’s Chancellor Erhard, now plagued by fears
of inflation, is fighting to avoid a common cereal price; the
Americans are fighting to maintain access to Europe for their
important agricultural products; and the French are trying
to block American agricultural imports while pursuing their
own plan to become agricultural leader in Europe.
Without a basic agreement on agriculture, the Kennedy
Round cannot go on to the second step of establishing a basis
for cutting industrial tariffs.
So the recriminations continue.
Decentralisation Gets Support from
Metal Trades Employers
HThe virtues of decentralising industry seem more often
preached about than practised. After many years of
Government inducement, and gradually improving facilities, it
is rather sobering to realise that only some 64,000 people are
employed by secondary industry in the country towns of New
South Wales.
Of course, the huge industrial complexes at Wollongong-
Port Kembla and Newcastle make the value of factory output
from country centres look very impressive. Yet overall develop-
ment has been extremely patchy.
A few weeks ago, the leader of the Federal Country p art .;
Mr McEwen, forcefully stressed his party’s support of deceit
tralisation. What the policy has meant in practice may \
judged from the July 15 edition of the “Metal Trades Journal)
which devotes itself exclusively to putting the general cai
once more and surveying its application in NSW.
The Metal Trades Employers’ president, Mr Normal
Pardoe, does not advocate a large-scale exodus from city d
country. “It is much more likely that the very desirable objet
tives of decentralisation will be brought about by the stead
growth of industry and commerce in suitable areas,” he believe!
He also realises the attractions of larger cities to man)
facturers proximity of the market, labor and raw material!
for instance. But the Journal realistically examines the effort!
of Government and civic authorities to provide counter-attrafi
tions, such as rail freight concessions, loans at reduced rate
of interest for factory buildings, subsidies for training skills
employees, and housing loans for key personnel.
In these matters, one detailed case study is probably wortl
a ton of principle. The Journal therefore provides the exampf
of Email at Orange. The company has established the manii
facturing centre of its consumer products division there ai&
now claims that this is “the largest and most self-containef
domestic appliance plant in the Southern Hemisphere.”
Email was initially attracted to Orange in 1946 by tli
Commonwealth Government making available surplus mm
tions plants, fully staffed, at a period of postwar recovery aif
labor shortage in the capitals. Housing was less difficult
freight and power cost concessions constituted a further bait, -
The Orange plan has fitted well into Email’s recent division!
reorganisation and integration. Indeed, it is now operating of
a regular two-shift basis.
The company at present finds no difficulty in expandim
its labor force, this at a time when critical labor shortages at
particularly apparent in metropolitan areas.
Email is honest enough to admit that there have been sore
liabilities in decentralising activities. These mainly comprisk
additional distribution, handling and storage expense, ana
special problems involving the re-location and training o|
management and technical staff.
The Orange success, though, fits in well with the genen
argument for decentralisation the dispersion of defenc
risks, balanced local economic development, and prevention
of drift from rural to metropolitan areas.
Bargain Hunters’ Paradise j
Meets Cost Pressures
Tnflationary and cost problems are not solely the preservi
of advanced industrial nations. The free port and tourist)
paradise of Hong Kong is now struggling with the conveff
tional inflationary pressures. I
Not that there is any sign of arrest in the still-boomin)
economy. But retail prices do insist on climbing upwards)
with a consequent loss of attraction to the tourist.
The explanation appears simple. Land has become very,
scarce, hectic demand for shop space balloons rentals in the
principal tourist areas: so proportional rises in retail prices
have to follow.
Since 1958, the cost of living has increased by 25 per cent
Tourist officials are growing anxious about the traditional
bargain atmosphere. Yet the free-enterprise Government ii|
pre-empted from taking any steps to control prices. Merchants
just keep on getting a spate of warnings, lest they destroy the
magnet of shopping benefits.
Officials have also discovered the touristic virtues of scen-
ery!

Breach in Price Stability
Budget must wrestle with demand pressures
Speaking on TV in Melbourne last
week Mr Holt gave the impression
of enjoying his pre-Budget exercise,
seeing the process of high prosperity
unfold, as he said, from the affairs of
eighteen Federal Government depart-
ments —as if these were the only chap-
ters in his book to the exclusion of the
surging activity of private enterprise in
the great surround. If he was referring
to the spending proposals of the de-
partments, well and good, because, if
the departments are in a super-pros-
perous mood, one look at the economy
outside them will convince the Treasurer
that their wings will need clipping. It
was timely for the Commonwealth
Statistician to release his figures on con-
sumer prices just as Cabinet sat down
to its annual Budget-casting session.
There’s no gainsaying that the 1 p.c.
increase in consumer prices in the June
quarter is unwelcome or even, perhaps,
that it is the forerunner of even bigger
increases to come once the impact of the
recent rise in the basic wage is registered
on prices. Nor should it be glibly ex-
plained away as being mostly to do
with special factors like a shortage of
meat and potatoes. If it may not derive
from the main pack of income genera-
tors as much as deficiencies on the
supply side, it is nonetheless a distinctive
herald of emerging possibilities seen in
the recent Economic Survey and by this
column over the last half-year. As
such it can hardly come as a big shock
to the Federal Government, a view
suggested in some quarters.
An the other hand, as we have pre-
viously suggested, the accumulated
force of income generation poses very
awkward problems for the Government
in its attempt to keep the yeast in the
economy from rising too high. These
must certainly oblige the Treasurer to
go for a substantial surplus in his forth-
coming Budget, whether or not this
means a swinging increase in taxation
or can be procured by the natural in-
crease in revenue he can confidently
expect in a situation of strongly rising
business activity. The emerging sums
suggest he will have to increase taxa-
tion to some extent to avoid deficit
financing in face of the scheduled in-
creases in spending, even if some of
these increases, such as on housing and
other capital works, may possibly have
to be curtailed to make a surplus
practicable.
The key question in front of Cabinet
is certainly how to moderate the increase
in prices which its Economic Survey
deemed to be inevitable, even if fairly
mild this year. The question was obvi-
ously much in the Treasurer’s mind in
his run down of the economy to the
Loan Council, when he gave a broad
clue to his approach to the Budget by
sharply cutting back their demands for
loan money. The case for this and also
for using the Budget to curb effective
demand received only scant treatment
in the Economic Survey, which aimed
more at painting the inflationary poten-
tial and showing the Government’s
awareness of it than pinpointing any
likely Government action.
11/Taybe the Treasurer was in two minds
about what was necessary when
he initialled the Government Survey.
Quite possibly he is still wondering
whether he can avoid bringing down a
sledgehammer, such as November,
1960’5, to stop the gathering economic
snowball in the private sector rolling
out of his control. He must be edging
towards a solution now, with the Budget
almost upon him and the consumer
prices rise for the June quarter in black
and white.
For Treasury experts interpolating the
possible effects of income buoyancy on
prices (one can no longer speak of
price stability!), messages brought back
to them from Ministers after the annual
pre-Budget pow-wow with industrial
leaders last week cannot have been of
much help if Mr McEwen’s summing-
up after the meetings (which were held
in camera ) is any guide. Needless to say,
the business leaders apparently didn’t
urge the Government to give the econ-
omy any general stimulus such as they
advised in full chorus last year. Nor,
it appears, did they think any drastic
dampener was required to what they
called the satisfactory state of the
economy, thinking perhaps that any lead
to the Treasurer in that direction would
come down on their own heads.
What the business leaders wanted
most was for the Government to help
lighten their individual cost loads in
face of the rise in the basic wage. One
of the lines suggested was to cut their
tax burden through reductions in payroll
tax and increases in depreciation allow-
ances. Such suggestions could hardly
fit very closely with the ideas of a
Government poised to mop up spend-
ing power by increasing taxation, but
they must surely have put some doubts
into Ministers’ minds if only because in-
flationary pressure is just as likely (even
more likely in the view of business) to
be exerted through increased costs as it
is through surplus demand. Indeed the
business leaders were dead against
interfering with the normal course of
demand.
f\ ne imagines, therefore, that these
talks with business were not very
much help to the Government, which
must surely be looking more for an ease-
ment in demand creation from the priv-
ate sector than from its own. That is the
natural disposition of any Government,
particularly an Australian Government
at this time, which not only has huge
additional defence commitments in the
offing but also has such a hard sub-
stantial core of running built-in commit-
ments. As the Economic Survey stated,
“For external reasons defence expendi-
ture has also been lifted and in all
branches of public authority spending
commitments are undertaken which
inevitably grow, largely because the
community and its needs are growing.
Some slowing down of the increase may
be possible, but the total is, neverthe-
less, certain to rise considerably”.
That points the essential dilemma
faced by the Treasurer in this Budget,
because, with Government spending
rising inexorably and at the behest of
practically all sections of the com-
munity, the scope for cutting back the
generation of effective demand from
that source is practically nil —the Eco-
nomic Survey could only talk of “limit-
ing increases in expenditure”. Reduc-
tions are apparently out of the question.
Thus the Government has to look pri-
marily to the private sector, which says
to it very bluntly, “Leave demand
alone”.
It would be very surprising, however,
if in fact the Treasurer did leave de-
mand alone in the coming Budget. The
evidence is on the line that, discounting
possible shortages in meat and potatoes,
demand pressures have already lifted
prices to a disconcerting extent in the
last six months, and this is without the
incidence of the additional spending
power flowing from the recent rise in
the basic wage. If it is wise, the
Government will attempt to stop this
breach in price stability here and now.
Because, as we have frequently pointed
out, if the community once gets into its
head that more price rises are on the
way, it will start making the necessary
dispositions to maintain its purchasing
power and thus make these further price
increases inevitable. It is a very familiar
process.


“CROESUS”
Wapet Now Opens the Door
Mountains of money still required
TlThile applauding as strongly as any-
” body the strenuous efforts of West
Australian Petroleum in exploring its
virtual monopoly of sedimentary basins
confronting Australia’s western coast-
line, one has long held and often ex-
pounded the view that it would be in the
national interest for other oil search
groups to share in these areas and so
multiply the speed of discovery. Wapet’s
recent oil and gas finds at Barrow
Island in no way diminish the case for
other groups to participate. Indeed, they
would seem to strengthen it. One came
back from a recent visit to these vast
areas more convinced of it than ever.
What is more, Wapet itself has conceded
it.
For many years one's thoughts, in
seeing its vast permit area of some
285,000 square miles fail to fulfil the
promise of the significant but uncom-
mercial oil scent at Rough Range in
1953, as ninety or more dry holes were
drilled in monotonous and frustrating
succession, were "increasingly directed to
the question whether Wapet’s efforts
were too widely dispersed.
With the company plugging on un-
daunted by failure, it remains a mystery
why the Western Australian Govern-
ment was satisfied that patience and
hard work would at length be rewarded
and no move was made to unscramble
the State’s permit allocations. Wapet
itself had become almost a supra-State
in the West and few doors seemed closed
to it there in the decade following the
Rough Range find. The only querulous
voices came from the East, including
my own, but until quite recently Wapet’s
answer was always the same.
TTowever, as long ago as 1958, the
' Caltex (US) group, which has
always dominated Wapet (and whose
associated companies, California Asiatic
Oil and Texaco Overseas Petroleum now
have a four-sevenths interest), was clear-
ly pondering the consequences of contin-
ued failure. In October that year, at the
price of Shell carrying all the operating
expenses for a period, Caltex lifted the
shutters to give that company a two-
sevenths interest, leaving Ampol Ex-
ploration with one-seventh in the
re-shuffle.
After a few years of heavy expendi-
ture, albeit with the other partners ulti-
mately relieving it of the full burden,
Shell was finding Wapet to be a widow’s
curse. While still contributing its share,
it was also going off to search on its
own in some other directions, taking
new permit areas first in Queensland,
then off the NSW coast and, more
recently, on the doorstep of Wapet itself,
offshore in NW Western Australia.
Whether under pressure from criti-
cism or not (the suggestion is that some
of the shots from the East got home to
Perth), late last year Wapet seemed
further to change in its attitude towards
the search task in the West. Possibly,
like Shell, Caltex was becoming less
hopeful of the result of the massive and
unproductive outlays, then estimated to
be upwards of £2i million this year, to
follow the £23 million already spent.
Possibly, also, a change in managing
director from one Caltex nominee,
Mr P. B. McGrath, to another, Dr
G. M. Furnival, was an influence.
This change didn’t involve a re-
casting of expenditure or programmes,
at any rate so far as has been disclosed
by the company. It was simply that
Wapet decided to let a few other inter-
ests explore in its areas on farmout
agreements. But it is a mighty signifi-
cant change all the same.
Tt remains to be seen what new farm-
out arrangements come to fruition
and in what areas, now that Wapet’s drills
have had two notable successess in two
widely separated areas. It is probably a
safe bet that no other group will be let
within easy boating distance of Barrow
Island or even the Monte Bello Islands,
to which Wapet has now lifted its sights.
(These islands, which are still held to be
radioactive, are easily visible with the
naked eye from Barrow Island, where
Wapet took me last week.)
In my view, and in the hopeful
view of geologists on the spot, it is
probable that Barrow Island (with a
greater depth of payable sands than
Moonie) and possibly the neighboring
offshore area will prove to be a big com-
mercial field. It will also be difficult to
delineate it, because, owing to the thick-
ness of limestone towards the surface,
seismic surveys look like being pretty
ineffective in locating possible reservoirs.
This will mean more extensive random
drilling than would otherwise be re-
quired. Again, a big marine seismic
programme will have to be undertaken
around Barrow Island. While this
poses big problems in this area, mainly
because the surrounding sea is very
shallow, marine seismic is usually better
than seismic work on adjacent land
areas.
Equally, one wouldn’t expect Wapet
to want any close neighbors to Yarda-
rino’ in the Perth Basin. Wapet's opera-
tors told me at that site they were con-
fident of this being a payable field
possibly bigger than Moonie, though the
form there is not necessarily expected
to be much further revealed by the
second Yardarino well going down now.
This well is aimed only to get gas from
the upper level structure, which pro-
duced some oil (and a huge volume of
gas) in the first hole, and then to test
much deeper rock formations.
T'iß Furnival assured me that even
with heavy additional follow-up ex-
penditure at Barrow Island and Yard-
arino, there would be no lack of funds to
push ahead with the rest of Wapet’s
search programme. One has, of course,
to accept this. But it could be a case of
deciding urgencies. It seems more than
likely that, for all the huge resources
both Shell and Caltex have to draw on,
something might have to give in the
event of the follow-up work at both
Barrow Island and Yardarino being
attended to at the highest dispatch. The
ideal from the national viewpoint would
be to give the development of both dis-
covery areas first priority claim on
Wapet’s resources. Caltex tells me that
this and future programmes at Barrow
Island and Yardarino will be decided at
an early date at meetings of Wapet’s
principals, whether here or in the US.
To keep to its programmes in other
areas and at the same time proceed with
the proving of the two areas of the
strikes, Wapet will obviously have to
bring in more men and equipment. [A
new deep (17,000 ft) drilling rig is to be
in operation in the Perth Basin by
October.] The extension of seismic
work in the Barrow Island and Yarda-
rino areas will keep two of Wapet’s
three seismic crews busy for a long
time at the expense of other areas.
All in all, one would have thought
that now, having pinpointed two very
promising areas, Wapet has more reason
than it ever had to welcome newcomers
into its vast permit areas in Western
Australia. While Wapet is willing to
welcome them, always providing that it
gets due benefit from the work it has
done in particular areas in its long
search in them, there is danger it might
become more choosy after its recent
successes. In any case, newcomers
should be warned. They will need a
mountain of money, broad backs and a
stomach for long-distance flying in out-
moded two-engined aircraft.

THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA
Industry Takes More Paint
Domestic usage declining
| Australia’s paint industry, currently
v 4* producing about £45 million worth
f of goods a year, is supplying more and
more to industry. Once we used twice
as much paint on homes as we did in
industry. The position has now changed
to the point where household paint com-
prises 60 p.c. of the market, and will
< soon be overtaken by industry’s require-
-1 ments.
The increased use of paint in industry
is reflected in higher production of con-
sumer durables such as motor cars and
washing machines. Another industrial
application of paint is in beer cans,
t where the can is lined with a clear lac-
quer to prevent the tinplate tainting the
contents.
Developments in paint for industrial
application have helped this expansion.
Two such innovations are acrylic lac-
quers for motor cars and stoving ena-
mels with great chemical resistance for
use on appliances.
Prior to the development of acrylic
lacquers about five years ago, cars were
finished with nitro-cellulose-based lac-
quers which had been in use for nearly
forty years. Although acrylic lacquer
is dearer, its hard-wearing properties and
brilliant gloss make it a more worth-
, while proposition than nitro-cellulose
laequers. The old type lacquers are still
used on motor cars for touch-up and
repair work.
Figures on production of acrylic lac-
quers are not collected by the Common-
wealth Statistician. However, produc-
tion of nitro-cellulose lacquers is shown.
In 1960-61, 1,367,000 gallons were pro-
duced; in 1961-62, 1,310,000 gallons;
and in 1962-63, 1,433,000 gallons. Pro-
duction for the first ten months of 1963-
64 was 1,268,000 gallons compared with
1,190,000 gallons for the preceding
corresponding period.
A more color-conscious public has
assisted in the development of acrylic
lacquers.
Biggest in the field of supply of
acrylic lacquers is BALM, a subsidiary
of ICIANZ which also produces “Du-
lux” house paints. BALM holds the
General Motors-Holden’s contract, a
valuable one in the light of the fact that
GM-H has the largest share of the new-
car market (31.9 p.c.), according to
recently published figures. BALM also
supplies other, smaller, car manufac-
turers including Volkswagen.
An executive of one of the big four
Paint producing companies said: “There
is still quite a lot of nitro-cellulose lac-
quer being produced, but it is gradually
giving way to acrylics. Acrylics will
never take over completely because
nitro-cellulose lacquers can be used for
repair work.”
Australia’s consumption of paint per
head of population is rising. In 1954
we used 1.84 gallons each and by 1963
we were using 2.19 gallons per head.
Expansion in the paint industry is not
confined solely to industrial paints, how-
ever. As indicated in last week’s
Bulletin, output has been rising in all
sectors of production. Current pros-
perity levels mean a lot more redecora-
tion and repainting of homes and build-
ings. According to most manufacturers
there has been a swing from “do-it-
yourself” back to the master painter.
Yet the companies still consider the
home handyman their most valuable
market and a lot of their advertising is
directed to stressing ease of application.
This has no doubt contributed to the
expansion in production of emulsion-
type paints, which are one day expected
to overtake oil-based paints for interior
decoration. Greatest use of paint is on
existing buildings and homes for reno-
vation. The new-building market is
small by comparison. But it is in new
houses and building that the industry
is most concerned. “There are inroads
being made into building techniques
which result in less conventional paint
being used,” one executive said.
“It is not having an immediate effect
since most paint is sold for renovation,
but what will happen to the market
when there are a considerable number of
houses and buildings which have used
the minimum or no paint materials? It
is hard to tell when we will reach this
stage in Australia . . . perhaps not until
after the year 2000, though the industry
must consider this now.” It is consider-
ing it, but is not treating it as a matter
of urgency. One company produces a
paint which “competes directly with
plastic materials.” Because of the
special skill and techniques needed to
apply it, it is not sold over the counter
but only to painting contractors. The,
paint is now in use in several office
blocks around Australia.
Tt was pointed out in last week’s
A Bulletin that Australian paint
manufacturers’ ties with the UK had
meant a lower cost of research. This
does not mean, however, that the indus-
try in Australia is skimping on research
expenditure. “Far from it,” said one
spokesman, “we’re spending a fortune.”
There is no factual figure on research
available but the Australian Paint Manu-
facturers’ Federation estimates wages
and salaries to chemists, draftsmen and

million and £1 million.
Although many ideas and improve-
ments are born in Australia, those im-
ported from overseas more often than
not need modification to suit our widely
varying climates. Mr K. V. Duffy,
executive director of the Federation,
said: “The product developed for English
requirements is not suitable for Austra-
lian use because of the vast array of
climatic conditions we have to meet.
Consequently the industry has a large
number of chemists and laboratory staff
on its payroll. Out of a total of 5096
people in the industry in 1961-62, 472,
or more than 9 p.c., were engaged on
research work.”
High protective tariffs applied to im-
ported raw' materials for paint are of
concern to the industry. Said one exe-
cutive: “We are supporting an infant
chemical industry to which the Govern-
ment has afforded room to grow by
applying high tariffs. This has made
the cost of raw materials higher in Aus-
tralia than those faced by overseas
manufacturers.” At present local pig-
ment manufacturers are seeking a 50
p.c. tariff on imported pigments. A
tariff enquiry into the chemical industry
shortly could mean even higher costs to
the paint industry.
The Federation has appeared before
the Tariff Board to request variations in
duties applicable to imported pigments,
saying they are excessive both in degree
and scope. Although a wide range of
pigments is manufactured in Australia,
imports are still vital if the industry is
to compete with overseas manufacturers.
The Federation wants tariffs lowered
and protection afforded to only those
pigments manufactured in Australia in
commercial quantities.
Present duties imposed on imported
paints and enamels are ss. per cwt Bri-
tish preference (17i p.c. ad valorem)
Bs. 3d. MFN (371 p.c.), and Bs. 3J
general tariff. On varnishes it is 2s. a
gallon (171 p.c. ad valorem), 3s. MFN
(321 p.c.), and 3s. 6d. general tariff
p.c.). These tariffs have remained i n
force for thirty years, a credit to the
industry's ability to keep pace with
world trends.
In the last 20 years the paint industry
has developed from an arts and crafts
stage using a limited number of raw
materials and consequently producing a
small range of goods to what is now a
specialised branch of the chemical in-
dustry. The development of a great
variety of new raw materials, particularly
synthetic resins and other synthetic film-
forming materials enabled the manufac-
ture of paints and industrial coatings for
an increasing range of application and,
in particular, the fast expanding second-
ary industries in Australia have made
great demands on the technical know-
how of the paint industry.
The Australian paint industry is highly
competitive with each company pro-
ducing paints wide in range, texture,
color and quality and at varying prices.
It does not stop with the makers, how-
ever. Retail prices also vary widely.
There has been talk of price-cutting in
the industry through discounts for large
orders but this, say some manufacturers,
is becoming less and less the case.
Manufacturers are keen to develop
their present export outlets of Papua-
New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji
and other areas in the Far East. They
are confident that through economic and
efficient production methods they will be
able to corner much of the available
market in this part of the world.

Australia’s Trade Commissioner in U.S.A.
Mr H. C. Menzies gets out vigorously and sells
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
It should have been good news to
Australian taxpayers that Henry
Copeland Menzies, senior trade commis-
sioner for Australia, had been continued
for another eighteen months in the post
he has filled with distinction in New York
for the past three years. They are get-
ting their money’s worth from this public
servant.
During that time it has not been en-
tirely a coincidence that American
businessmen and industrialists have
“discovered” Australia as a major area
for investment, that American tourists
are going “Down Under” in far greater
numbers (thirty per cent more this year
than last), or that Americans are con-
suming nearly four times as much Aust-
ralian beef and mutton and using twice
as much Australian wool as they were a
few years ago.
Not that Harry Menzies himself would
claim the slightest credit for these im-
pressive statistics. A veteran of the Gov-
ernment trade department, though, with
thirty years of service in Melbourne,
Tokyo, New Zealand and Hong Kong,
Menzies brought an experienced and ima-
ginative approach to the New York post,
obviously a critically important one,
when he came here in 1961.
From his Fifth Avenue headquarters,
Menzies is responsible for Australian
trade matters in the entire area of the
US east of the Mississippi River, which
includes every major city except Los
Angeles, as well as Mexico, rapidly deve-
loping as an important customer for
Australia. When he arrived in New
York, Menzies decided the only way to
sell Australia to Americans was to get
out and “show” Australia to Americans.
To accomplish this objective, Menzies
organised and directed highly successful
Australian trade seminars in cities such
as Buffalo, New York, Dallas, Pitts-
burgh and Providence (Rhode Island).
A typical trade seminar, Menzies
** version, lasts a full working week.
Advertisements in local newspapers alert
the populace to the fact that the Aussies
are coming. Menzies and his task force,
including representatives of the Aust-
ralian News and Information Bureau
and the Australian National Travel
Association, arrive and make themselves
available to local newspapers, radio and
television stations for interviews, panel
shows and the like. The local mayor
holds a reception at which Menzies is
the principal guest. The mayor and his
wife receive gifts Australian wool
or kangaroo leather goods. A wine-
tasting, featuring Australian wines and
beers, is held at a smart restaurant.
Local departmental stores and other
shops feature Australian fabrics or
designs in their windows.
Menzies has helped turn Mexico from
a remote and picturesque Latin Amer-
ican tourist shop to an Australian custo-
mer one which will become increa-
singly important. He was instrumental
in implementing the sale and current
large-scale shipment of Australian sheep
to Mexico for breeding and strengthening
local flocks. He flies to Durango to
observe the landing of each shipload
and report home on the condition of the
animals upon arrival.
* 1VT exico * s undoubtedly the most pro-
country in Latin America,”
Menzies observed. “The Government is
stable there are six living ex-presi-
dents and receptive to foreign invest-
ment and trade. The recent visits of
General de Gaulle and the Japanese
Crown Prince and Princess indicate the
world’s interest in the country. I foresee
lively Australian trade with this country
in raw materials—wool, rutile and grain
products. Remember, too, that Qantas
will begin service to Mexico this year
and many Australians will be stopping off
there en route to London and Europe.
“More than a thousand million dollars
have been invested in Australia by
American corporations and individuals,”
Menzies pointed out. “This is just the
beginning. Americans look upon Aust-
ralia as being ripe for large-scale capi-
talisation, the way their own country was
fifty or seventy-five years ago. They look
upon Australia as the ‘last frontier’ for
investors. Many businessmen I have met
here say to me, ‘I wish I were thirty
years younger, I would go to Australia
myself.’ Some have sent their sons in-
stead, and set them up in business in
Australia.”
Menzies feels that Australia should
try to attract skilled American labor, as
well as capital.
“Oweden has been successful in getting
native-born American workers to
emigrate,” he noted. “I believe Austra-
lia could do the same thing. The much-
vaunted difference in wage scales be-
tween America and Australia is not as
great as advertised, when you get down
to basics such as rent and food. I
think an intensive drive to bring skilled
workers to Australia from the US
would turn out to be a surprising suc-
cess.
“The great nostalgia for Australia
among the Gl’s of the last World War
is disappearing,” Menzies realises. “It
is important for Australia to keep its
name constantly before the Americans
-—in a positive, attractive context. I
am not sure just how this can be done
most effectively. That is something for
Canberra to consider quite seriously, in
my view. We have a really priceless
reputation, or image, if you will. We
must work on keeping it.”

MARKET POINTERS
Watch for the Risky Curve
Share market’s clear road looks blocked
With economic pointers so good, the
investment share market early in
July envisaged a clear road ahead. But
prosperity brings its own problems, and
the market had second thoughts last
week when it learned of the sharp one
p.c. rise in the Consumer Price Index
for the June quarter.
Nagging thoughts arose on the possible
measures likely to be taken by the
Federal Government in its Budget on
August 11. Irrespective of whether
there was an increase in sales tax, or
direct tax increases on companies and
individuals, the psychological effect is
bound to dampen recent enthusiasm.
And it was all so good, too. Metals
were booming, more oil had been dis-
covered, company reports were more
helpful.
Still, the share market is supposed to
reflect the prospects of income and in-
vestment returns on money invested. It
is no use running ahead with price rises
if the companies can’t back it up with
improved earning rates.
★ ★ ★
Ane of the items trickling through to
the market is that agricultural
equipment manufacturers and distribu-
tors must have had a good year. Also,
with farm incomes so buoyant, sales of
implements and tractors are likely to
remain high.
Shares in such companies have been
recommended before, but they have
achieved only a slow, steady rise.
These include companies like David
Shearer, Waugh & Josephson, Ralph
McKay and others.
Some have had nasty losses to over-
come and the relatively heavy capitalisa-
tion, encouraged in earlier boom years,
makes it more difficult in some cases for
earning rate to look respectable.
But it is said that profit recoveries
will please shareholders and possibly
strengthen the shares when results are
published.
It’s a thought to keep in mind, after
the Budget.
★ ★ ★
jVJiNSTER Ltd, the Melbourne-based
carpet manufacturer which operates
in three States, continues to show a re-
markably high earning rate and has
come out with a 56.8 p.c. rate for 1963-
64 against 43.8 p.c. in the previous year.
The market has kept the price very
high, knowing the company’s earning
capacity. It also is keeping in mind the
one-for-two bonus of 1961 and waiting
for a repeat dose.
Unfortunately for the newcomer,
prices of around 98s. for the 10s. par
value share already have an inbuilt
anticipation of a solid bonus issue. It
is one of those shares, however, that
can always be reviewed after a general
market setback, when attentions are
diverted elsewhere.
★ ★ ★
Exploration’s one-for-four
par issue reminds shareholders that
the company must subscribe one-seventh
of oil exploration costs to retain its in-
terest in Wapet’s oil drilling programme.
The two recent drilling developments
at Barrow Island, and Yardarino will
encourage Wapet to step up its pro-
gramme, which means more money.
So there could be a few more share
issues ahead of Ampol Exploration.
★ ★ ★
rpRANSOiL, sponsored by Exoil, came on
the market last week and the Is.
paid shares were traded at Is. 4d. before
weakening. It was still a better price
than many expected earlier in the piece
when, as existing shareholders in Exoil,
they refused to take up their entitlements.
Two oil strikes Barrow Island and
Alton helped to encourage more oil
enthusiasm, without which it is probable
that the market reception for Transoil
would have been less buoyant.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Three Crucial Points on Coles
New expansion programme vital for earning rate
fAuR daily newspapers devoted columns
of print to G. J. Coles when it
announced the results of its successful
1963-64 year last week. Out of these,
there are three crucial points which must
be considered if one is at all interested
in the company’s future, rather than in
sitting back and reflecting on the re-
leased figures, which are now little more
than history.
In fact, one cannot conclude anything
about the £3.9 million record profit with
accuracy unless sales depreciation and
tax are brought into the picture. This
is the first crucial point. These figures
were not released for publication with
the profit result. Shareholders must
now await the balance sheet for these —
such was the case last year.
To a company which operates on such
narrow profit margins, the percentage of
net profit to sales is just as important in
measuring performance as net profit it-
self. A falling-off in this percentage, if
it is serious, can be a bad sign. A rise
is a healthy sign: efficiency. Without
this figure at hand, it is unwise to make
categorical statements about perform-
ance. In addition, it is also unwise to
draw any definite conclusions from the
profit figure alone, without having de-
preciation and tax available. Tax figures
are often not in line with the revealed
profit (indicating secret reserve changes)
and depreciation is very prone to
abnormal rises or falls from time to
time.
The other two points are vital to
future success. First, there is the decision
to take on vigorous expansionary moves
£94 million will be spent this year,
compared with between £5 million and
£6 million in 1963-64. This decision
could either make or break performance
in the short run, if not the long one.
The brilliant Coles’ management will
undoubtedly pull off a success. Plenty of
planning has preceded their decision. A
close watch has been kept on consumer
trends in the past two years and this has
formed the basis of their plans. Thirty
supermarkets will go up, doubling the
present number, and 20 new variety
stores wili add to the present tally of
252. In all, the group had 552 outlets
at June 30 last, 30 less than 1963 as
small grocery and retail outlets were
closed down in conjunction with the
opening of larger stores and new super-
markets.
All these new stores take time to
reach a normal rate of profitability. The
present supermarkets, for example, made
a very small contribution to the 1963-64
result but they are now doing well. A
few years ago, they took nearly three
years to become as profitable as variety
stores. Today this term has been con-
siderably shortened.
This is where the final point comes
into play. In the current year, paid
average ordinary capital of around £22
million will be boosted to around £244
million through the current shareholders’
issue and a placement made back in
May. Will the new stores opened in
1963-64 reach peak performance quickly
enough to maintain the present 17.6 p.c.
earning rate on the higher capital? The
answer will probably be yes, as this
necessitates a profit lift of only some-
thing between £200,000 and £300,000.
The gain was £219,000 in the 1963-64
year.
However, one hopes that in the long
run, when all these new stores are oper-
ating efficiently, earnings will get a
chance to return to the buoyant 20 p.c.
to 25 p.c. levels of the mid-’fifties. In
the light of this goal, one can more easily
see how crucial the attaining of success
will be in the new expansion programme.
A Cheering Parent
group result is not yet to
hand, the parent company of Aus-
tralian Paper Manufacturers Ltd had a
bumper year. Dividend goes up from
the 8j p.c. paid for the last two years
to 81 p.c.
The company rules off its books on
June 30, but group result is not avail-
able until September.
Most pleasing feature is that the sales
trend in the closing stages of the year
was upwards, indicating favorable de-
mand conditions for 1964-65.
Sales of paper and board products
totalled 362,663 tons, or 31,630 tons
greater than in 1962-63.
The parent profit of £2,938,891 com-
pares with £1,610,693 in the recession
year 1960-61 and £2,672,562 in 1962-
63.
Investors are recovering their confi-
dence in this stock. The 375. 3d. now
asked for the 20s. units compares with
peaks of around 40s. 6d. and 41s. in
1959 and 1960.
CMI Strengthens
Active portfolio management again
contributed to the strengthening of
shareholders’ funds of Commonwealth
Mining Investments (Australia) Ltd.
The capital profit on realisation of
part of the investment portfolio was
£147,441 in the year to June 30, 1964;
the year before it was £397,309.
Net profit rose from £180,856 to
£290,517, after tax provision of £23,500
(1963 £6500).

ventures by £9OO, increased from
£3,465,483 to £3,629,212, after pro-
viding £186,754 for the dividend.
Almost 55 p.c. of paid capital is held
by Consolidated Gold Fields (Aust.)
pty, the rest by English and Australian
investors. The 10s. shares are quoted
on Australian Associated Stock Ex-
changes, where they have been changing
hands at around 17s. 2d.
At 1964 balance date, net tangible
asset backing based on the market value
of the portfolio was 17s. 10id. a unit,
compared with 13s. 9d. in 1963.
The new earning rate of 11.3 p.c.
(1963 6.8 p.c.) gave more comfortable
cover for the steady 7 p.c. dividend.
In 1963, 46.9 p.c. of the total book
value of investments was in copper,
lead and zinc stocks. Investment in
gold had been reduced in favor of tin.
The better results this year are no doubt
attributable largely to investments in
the Barriers and in titanium stocks.
Petries into Permewan
rTHE market, which put the ss. shares
of Petries Holdings Ltd up Is. 9d.
to 10s. in late March when a “Don't
sell” warning was first issued, was either
well informed or made an accurate
assessment of their worth.
Permewan Wright Ltd has offered to
purchase this produce business by share
exchange, worth at the date of notifica-
tion 9s. 9d. a share, and 9s. 6d. cash
for odd shares.
One Permewan share (worth 165.) is
offered for every two Petrie shares.
Petries, headquartered in Camden
(NSW), would fit nicely into the Perme-
wan Wright chain. It has been a public
company for only three years.
More Than Paper Profit
Dunlop and Co. Ltd made
yet another record profit in the
year to April 30, 1964. Result was
£241,408, net of £134,339 tax and
£105,849 dividend.
Although the new earning rate of
12.3 p.c. is quite unexceptional (the 10
p.c. dividend is paid for the eighth year
in a row), the accounts give an impres-
sion of strength and conservatism.
The £1,965,000 capital is now sup-
ported by reserves of £1,471,141
(mostly general reserves).
Group activities cover wholesale
merchandising of paper and board,
stationery, machinery for the graphic
arts, paper processing and converting,
and several service companies.
Extensions to the New Zealand fac-
tory and alterations to the Alexandria
(NSW) factory were financed with the
aid of additional debenture money.
The major paper processor and con-
verter W. Nevill is moving to new pre-
mises. An inkling of inner reserves
was given by directors when they an-
nounced in the 1964 report that the
main costs of removal would be met
from a provision set aside for this pur-
pose some years ago.
Current liabilities were reduced from
£3,211,183 to £2,591,610. They in-
clude a £308,209 “provision for stock
depreciation and contingencies”, which
directors could at some future date, if
the mood takes them, decide is no
longer required.
The last bonus was a three-for-five
in 1955-56, the last cash issue a one-
for-five at 12s. 6d. premium in 1960-61.
. The market is not unduly optimistic
in pricing the 20s. shares at 525., where
the present yield is 3.8 p.c.
The National Bag Mystery
At last it has happened! National
Bag, the Melbourne-based manu-
facturer of packaging materials, has
entered into takeover negotiations. For
several years now, shareholders have
seen their shares take sudden jumps on
the numerous occasions when a bid has
been rumored.
This time it’s definitely on. although
the mere holding of negotiations does
not necessarily mean that a bid will
result. In fact, mergers have seemed
more inclined to fall through, rather
than succeed, where directors’ talks are
necessary before making a bid rather
than after it. The most recent example
of this was between Drug Houses and
Henry Berry.
However, too much importance should
not be attached to this line of thought,
as the success of such moves does not
depend at all on whether pre-bid talks
are held, but rather on the reasons why
talks were necessary. If the truth was
known, it would most probably be that
a majority of bids are preceded by talks
of some description, but the Stock Ex-
change is never informed of them. This
argument may be backed up by the
fact that most companies score abnormal
gains on the market just before bids
are made. Where there’s smoke there’s
fire, so to speak.
There were obviously leaks in the
National Bag case —in the week before
the “don’t sell” announcement, the ss.
shares rose from 20s. to 225. lid. In
addition, almost 9000 call options were
taken out at various prices. The last
lot before the announcement carried a
premium of Is. 9d. on top of the 235.
exercise price so with brokerage the
owner must clear 255. 2d. before he
turns in a profit.
On this basis, someone may be con-
sidering that the bid is somewhere be-
tween, say, 265. and 28s. Of course,
this is only surmise and what the bid
will be, if it eventuates, is anybody’s
guess. Even the net tangible asset back-
ing is no help in this case. It is only
12s. 9d. way below the market price.
The other nagging question is picking
who the bidder is. It could be any one
of the numerous companies in the pack-
aging industry, or one of National’s
customers who could cut costs from
such a takeover or, the most likely pos-
sibility of all, some company diversifying.
This last category swings one’s

LAUSANNE EXPOSITION
April to October, 1964
thoughts rather sharply to the rapidly
diversifying British Tobacco. It was only
last April that it acquired a third interest
in Dodge Consolidated—another packag-
ing company.
However, British Tobacco has denied
that it is negotiating with National Bag.
So have APM, Containers, J. Gadsden,
Dodge, Reed Paper, F. W. Williams,
Felt and Textiles and Bates, according
to the Melbourne “Age”. These denials
were revealed in a story printed by that
paper, which placed considerable sig-
nificance on the fact that Fibre Con-
tainers refused to comment on sugges-
tions that it may be involved in take-
over talks.
North BH Buoyancy
TDeceipts at Broken Hill for North
Broken Hill Ltd rose in the year to
June 30, 1964, from £4,679,000 to
£9.045.000. (These figures are sales, net
of freight and treatment charges.)
This tremendous advance is due not
only to higher sales of lead, zinc and
silver, but also to substantially better
prices realised.
Sales of lead rose from 60,089 to
73,288 tons, while the price strengthened
from £66 4s. 9d. to £9O 12s. 2d. Zinc
concentrates sold went up from 87,735
to 105,524 tons, and the price from
£B7 6s. Id. to £ll5 3s. sd. Sales of
silver improved from 2,726,251 to
3,806,740 ounces, and the price from
10s. 7.71 d. to 11s. 5.37 d.
The company spent £3,639,000 in
working expenditure at Broken Hill, and
another £267,000 in revenue expenditure
during 1963-64. Capital expenditure
was £310,000.
The amount of investment income
earned by Norths is not yet known
(previous year £638,653), nor are
royalties and taxation.
After the news release, the 10s. shares
remained at close to 41s. 6d. which
compares with last year’s range from
19s. 3d. to 395. Id.
On the Edge of Their Chairs
nothing very new or scintil-
lating to say about Minster’s result
for the year to June 30, released last
week. Profit rose from £718,000 to
£931,000 and dividend will be held at
20 p.c. again. The result was an all-time
record, as was the earning rate of 56.8
p.c. It compared with 43.8 p.c. last year.
Basically, the brilliant result was
derived from the simple combination of
two facts —the company’s monopoly in
the production of Westminster carpet
and its specialisation on only non-woven
carpets. These are cheaper than the
woven product and substantial dernand
lifts took place during the year. Current
year prospects look good, as long as
all these people building new homes
can go on affording to install non-woven
carpets.
Of course the thing which now has
shareholders sitting on the edges of their
chairs is the possibility of a scrip issue.
The earning rate has never been above
50 p.c. before. In 1958-59 and 1959-60
it came pretty close, but a one-for-two
bonus knocked it back under 40 p.c.
in 1960-61. It has been climbing back
ever since. Directors may consider that
it looks a little too high and, having
regard to the record year, the en-
couraging future prospects, and the fact
the dividend has not been lifted despite
the result, one can’t help feel that an
issue will not be long in coming.
Rolling Stock
Pomeng Holdings Ltd, the Sydney-
based heavy engineers with interests
in South Africa, gave shareholders ad-
vance notice that profits for the year to
June 30 would show a most satisfactory
increase over 1962-63.
Dividend is an assured 10 p.c. Last
year, the earning rate was 13.4 p.c. and
ordinary capital is unchanged since then.
In May of this year, the company
announced that the South African sub-
sidiary had obtained an £8.7 million
order for 267 suburban railway cars.
Comeng also supplies rolling stock to
Australian railways, though on a rather
smaller scale. The business is extremely
competitive in Australia, with narrow
margins.
The ss. shares are likely to strengthen
on present price of 6s. 9d., where the
yield is 7.4 p.c., when further details
of 1963-64 trading are released.
Enthusiasm should be tempered,
however, by the knowledge that
£257,188 of 7 p.c. notes convert to
capital on June 30, 1965 (raising paid
capital to £1,947,051), and recognition
of a heavy engineer’s sensitivity to
economic recessions.
Haughton’s New Heights
T>uoyant world sugar prices projected
Haughton Sugar Co. Ltd to heights
undreamt of seven or eight years ago.
A profit of £164,402, or 36.3 p.c. on
capital increased by a one-for-two
bonus, is a far cry from the loss of
£11,581 in 1957 arid the dividend-less
days of 1957 and 1956.
Latest result compares with £70,643
in the year to May 31, 1963. Provi-
sion for tax is up from £47,610 to
£109,000 and depreciation from £48,000
to £90,000.
Last year’s generous dividend of 15
p.c. was even bettered this year, with
a 171 p.c. distribution. Bonus shares
ranked for the full 171 p.c.
Now the company is to make a one-
for-three par issue to finance current

Metropolitan Industries must be

offer.
But their willingness has now turned
to something stronger in a letter cir-
culated by directors recommending the
bid, it was revealed that the earning rate
had collapsed from 18.2 p.c. last year
to 10 p.c. Apart from any effect such
a result would have had on market
prices, it is a safe bet that last year’s
10 p.c. dividend would have suffered, if
it was not omitted.

Ampol Exploration’s Propitious
Issue Timing
HHhe flow of oil from Wapet’s Barrow Island No. 1 well makes
a propitious time for Ampol Exploration Ltd to raise funds
for further work, by a one-for-four par issue.
In the excitement of hearing the most encouraging news in
12 years’ oil search (and the expenditure of over £23 milion),
investors have been prepared to pay more than four times
par for the ss. shares.
The issue is underwritten. The major shareholder in Ampol
Exploration Ltd, Ampol Petroleum Ltd, will be taking up its
full entitlement (costing approximately £774,000).
Wapet, in which, of course, Ampol Exploration has only a
one-seventh interest, is also drilling at Yardarino, in another

Marchants Still Hovering on
a Cliff’s Edge
Well, the Receivers’ axe has finally dropped on Marchants.
T ’ In one way it’s something of a relief, as the company
has had the shadow of the hatchet looming over its head
ever since last December, when it failed to meet a debt
(under interest of 12 p.c., it is now standing at just under
£300,000) to Esanda. The future is now much clearer than
it was before Esanda introduced receivership and manage-
ment.
Yet British Tobacco’s renewed takeover bid still seems to
leave things swinging in the balance. Several things could
happen.
First, the directors may be successful in negotiating f or
another loan to pay off Esanda straight away. This would
end the receivership. But then the remaining creditors may
decide that a receivership was to their advantage. Their
decision would depend on their attitude to the repayment
plans proposed by directors under the reconstruction pro-
posals full return of funds, in instalments, by 1968.
If this possibility eventuates, then the future looks good
for shareholders as long as they are prepared to sub-
scribe to the share issue which is part of the reconstruction
scheme. Without this, the profitable subsidiary (all the others
will be disposed of for an estimated £110,000) will not have
enough liquid funds to perform at its peak. Directors
estimate that it can turn in a profit of £46,000 in the current
year. This figure was only £26,000 in the latest term to
March 31 because of liquidity problems.
Of course, from this line of thought, we can see another
road to the future. If shareholders do not subscribe to the
issue and it is not underwritten, then recovery will be ex-
tremely difficult, if not impossible. Such being the case,
creditors may be inspired to step in again with a receivership.
If the directors do not raise a loan to pay off Esanda, then
this course of events will be completely different. Esanda will
be in the box seat. In theory, of course, the two receivers
are the men with the say, but, in practice, Esanda’s interests
will be foremost in their mind, because it was that company
which put them in to protect its interests. Broadly, the re-
ceivers’ plans will be to sell off the dead wool and, if pos-
sible, keep the profitable subsidiary on its feet.
It is impossible to elaborate any further than this at such
an early stage, because the receivers themselves do not have
any detailed plans at present. One of them, Mr K. C. Keown,
emphasised to The Bulletin last week that there were no
intentions to step in and wipe out the company altogether.
Marchant’s full annual accounts will help in deciding where
the best value lies. Until then, and until it is known whether
the directors’ reconstruction schemes have any chance of
coming off, shareholders’ fortunes are right on the cliff edge.
Golden Eggs in Profusion
From Golden Poultry
A couple of golden eggs have been laid for shareholders
in Golden Poultry Farming Industries. On July 18, a
daily newspaper announced that a stockbroker was predicting
a profit lift from £59,000 to £lOO,OOO for the year to June 30.
The * broker also pointed out that rapid growth was straining
financial resources, which meant that new issues to share-
holders could be made in the next twelve months.
Then, on July 21, when shareholders were still smiling
over their first egg, the company announced that a one-for-five
par issue would be made in September.
These two announcements did not take anyone completely
by surprise. It had already been reported that sales rose
56 p.c. in the nine months to March 31 and that profits had
increased in line with this rise. Directors said this trend
should continue until the end of the year.
Shattered Humes-Wunderlich
Pipe Dreams
ambitious venture by Wunderlich Ltd and Humes Ltd
to set up asbestos pipe plants in both Sydney and Mel-
bourne has ended with a sale of the joint company to James
Hardie Asbestos Ltd, the dominant firm in asbestos in Aus-
tralia.
Each of the original partners invested £500,000 in share
capital, but Wunderlich wrote down its investment to £200,000
in 1963-64 in view of the £507,265 lost by the asbestos pipe
company up to October 30, 1963.

Sugar Leader’s Shares are Attractive
Effects of bid to buy half of Ready Mixed Concrete
By ROGER RANDERSON
At a time when the earnings of The
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd
are continuing at a record high level,
when the company is aggressively ex-
panding in new as well as old fields, and
when its prospects could scarcely be
brighter, the market price of CSR
shares has fallen considerably.
No doubt this established “blue chip”
has felt the same effect as other invest-
ments from the hardening of interest
rates, together with speculation about
tax rates in the coming Federal Budget.
An additional slight adverse influence
may be the weakening of marginal
world sugar prices, as larger European
beet crops are expected, although the
excess of world demands over supplies
is likely to continue.
Neither of these factors, however,
sufficiently explains why CSR’s £1 share
is only 81s. 9d. at the time of writing,
having dropped by almost 9 p.c. from
this year’s high point of 89s. 9d. reached
on June 12.
On June 22, it will be remembered,
CSR and Blue Metal Industries Ltd to-
gether announced that they each desired
to buy a half interest in Ready Mixed
Concrete Ltd.
The price of CSR shares had weak-
ened to 87s. just prior to this, but their
subsequent decline is related to the
“takeover bid”, although, in sharp con-
trast, BMI shares are at almost the same
prices as when the offer was first made
public.
Shareholders of Ready Mixed Con-
crete Ltd are being offered 8 CSR £1
stock units and 28 BMI ss. stock units,
together with £l3 2s. in cash, in ex-
change for each 100 of their RMC 3s.
shares.
Market reactions seem to be based on
an assumption that few of the 21,000
small RMC shareholders will want to
hold the CSR shares they receive, and
that many of these shares will be sold
on the market, thus depressing the price,
if only temporarily.
Little weight, apparently, is being
given to other terms of the offer, where-
by RMC shareholders will be paid addi-
tional cash at the rate of 87s. per whole
CSR share for fractions and for shares
that fall short of marketable multiples
of 25.
More notice appears to have been
taken of the intention to pay RMC
shareholders additional cash at the rate
of 265. 6d. per whole BMI share for
fractions and for shares that fall short
of marketable multiples of 50.
I have long since held a healthy re-
spect for the synthesis of investors’
opinions which market prices reflect.
RMC shareholders may, in fact, dis-
pose of some or all of the CSR shares
they must accept, and placements will
have to be made of their “odd lots”
bought for cash—so that the recent de-
cline in the price of CSR shares could
be the correct short-term reaction in
discounting these possibilities.
In these circumstances, it is desirable
to reassess CSR shares, in the light of
the company’s recently published
accounts and having regard to the effect
of acquiring a half interest in Ready
Mixed Concrete Ltd.
This may help to convince RMC
shareholders not to discard the bargain
that is being offered to them.
If the assessment fails to achieve this
object, it may nevertheless alert other
investors to a favorable technical posi-
tion for acquiring CSR shares at a
reasonable price, which may be develop-
ing.
When expressing the opinion last
December that CSR’s earnings, after an
increase of 44 p.c. in 1962-63, would be
even better in 1963-64, I had no idea
that the recently published accounts
would disclose the further remarkable
increase of 64 p.c.
Nor, when stressing greatly improved
growth prospects for CSR shares, was
I able to foresee the extent of the

[aggressive expansion that the company
( ‘j s °now undertaking.
The annual report gave reasons why
the Board considered that profit in the
twelve months ending March 31, 1965,
is “likely to approximate” last year’s
record level.
; Dividend (with the increased final
distribution of Is. 6d. a share, or H
p.c., made on July 22) was raised to
121 p.c. for 1963-64 higher than it
had been for 30 years, and the same
rate as was paid for the series of nine
expansive years from 1925-26 to 1933-
34.
CSR’s directors are “quite confident”
that the 12i p.c. dividend will be main-
tained for 1964-65, allowing for the
increase in capital that will occur if
RMC shareholders accept the offer for
their holdings.
f Indeed, they have already informed
RMC shareholders that they will share
in the 6} p.c. interim dividend to be
paid by CSR in December.
I felt last December that the £1 share
at 765. 6d. was good value, because it
was equivalent to paying 18.9 times
1962-63 earnings, and, because although
a 2.6 p.c. yield from 10 p.c. dividends
was low, it came from a 5.3 p.c. earn-
ings yield that was more satisfactory.
Today the share can be bought for
81s. 9d., which is equivalent to paying
13.4 times 1963-64 earnings, with a
dividend yield of 3.1 p.c. from 12i p.c.
dividends, and an earnings yield at the
'attractive rate of 7.3 p.c.
Let us now turn to CSR’s accounts
for the year ended March 31 and the
further information that is available
concerning the company’s prospects and
plans for expansion.
; Stated profit for 1963-64 increased
by £2,889,022 (64.1 p.c.) to £7,395,839,
showing an improvement in the earn-
ing rate on capital from 20.5 to 30.6
p.c.
CSR achieved this result after char-
ging £4,396,199 for “replacement” of
assets (an increase of £283,594) and
providing £4,771,897 for income tax
(an increase of £1,318,851).
The company’s auditors (one notes
in the booklet making the offer to RMC
shareholders) placed 1963-64 earnings
even higher at £7,484,773. Some sub-
sidiaries, too, are still contributing
figures compiled three months earlier
than those of the parent company.
Considering this, and additions to
provisions shown in the accompanying
table, it would not be too rash to add
that CSR is stating its profits “con-
servatively”.
Earlier ideas that CSR’s earning-
capacity is limited need to be revised
ia the light of the upward tendency of
stated profit since consolidated accounts
were first published:
Profit—£ Rate —%
1960- 2,617,735 12.4
1961- 3,129,679 14.8
1962- 4,506,817 20.5
1963- 7,395,839 30.6
CSR last year retained £4,372,046,
or 59 p.c., of its stated earnings after
paying out £3,023,794 to meet the cost
of the 12i p.c. dividend on existing
capital of £24,190,348.
In other words, the existing dividend
was covered 2.4 times.
Even if CSR had to allot the theoreti-
cal maximum of £2,643,200 additional
shares for the purpose of acquiring its
half-interest in Ready Mixed Concrete
Ltd, this would increase the dividend
commitment by only £330,400 —and
the increase would be more than met
from an estimated addition of £550,000
to its earnings by acquiring the half
share in the latter company.
However, the new capital to be issued
will be far less than the theoretical
maximum. CSR disclosed that it already
held 684,500 RMC shares, when giving
notice of the intended takeover scheme,
which relieves it of the necessity to issue
£54,760 additional capital.
Insofar as RMC shareholders accept
A cash at the rate of 87s. for a whole
CSR share in exchange for fractions,
and for shares falling short of multiples
of 25, the need to issue capital will be
further reduced.
According to the annual report, final
consideration for acquiring the half-
interest in Ready Mixed Concrete Ltd
will involve “upwards of 2\ million
shares in CSR, say 10 p.c. of the then
total issued capital; and something more
than £2 million in cash”.
Cash is no problem for the company.
The table shows the great increase in
cash balances during the past two years,
despite the continuing redemption of
maturing debentures. Debenture issues
in the past three years have been re-
duced by about almost £5 million to
£2,816,100.
Another notable feature is the growth
in the company’s investments, which
now have a market value of at least
£9,l22,ooo—almost £2 million in excess
of the balance sheet figure.
The marginal world price of sugar
may have dipped slightly below the
figure of £46 sterling, which the Board
stated was satisfactory for a large pro-
portion of exports, “as a component of
the overall market for home consump-
tion and export sugar, especially where
the crop and the tonnage of raw sugar
are large”.
Far more important than present
fluctuations in day-to-day world prices
of sugar is the fact that CSR estimates
that its output of raw sugar will rise by
113,000 tons to 765,000 tons this year
and that further increases are planned
for 1965 and 1966.
The company is increasingly reaping
the fruits from its far-sighted, but diffi-
cult, extension into the field of building
materials. While there is some excess
capacity making local competition in-
tense, the company is earning small pro-
fits, too, by developing a considerable
export business.
Sales of the company’s industrial
chemicals continue to be buoyant, and,
although imports are exerting pressure
on prices, the Tariff Board is now exa-
mining this question.
It is impossible to list all the ramifi-
cations of this industrial giant, which
is forming alliances with producers in
other industries, besides that with Blue
Metal Industries.
Recent developments include the pro-
posal to join with lames Hardie Asbes-
tos Ltd in operating their thermal insu-
lation divisions as a joint venture.
CSR has taken a 45 p.c. interest with
American Metal Climax Inc. in deve-
loping the rich iron ore deposits in the
area of Mount Newman (Western Aus-
tralia).
The company is also investigating the
prospects of establishing a possible sugar
industry on the Ord River in Western
Australia.
Large amounts of capital will be re-
quired in coming years to finance such
developments, besides providing ancil-
lary facilities for present plans to expand
the sugar industries of Queensland and
Fiji.
It is true that CSR is in an extremely
liquid position at present, and that its
retained cash flow may be running at
the rate of £9 million a year.
Nevertheless, shareholders could be
called on in the future to supply further
capital on terms that include a bonus
element, and, with the maintenance of
earnings, the prospect of bonus issues in
the future is also improved.
It is true that the post-war record of
capital issues to shareholders — 1950,
one-for-five at the equivalent of 275.;
1957, one-for-three bonus issue 1962,
one-for-seven at 30s. —has not been
impressive.
But growth prospects of CSR shares
are now transformed as the company is
vigorously applying resources won from
the recovery in world commodity prices
towards expansion and diversification.
CSR shares promise to be a most
rewarding investment at present prices—
and not “dear”, as would be more
widely seen if their present price were
recognised as equivalent to paying no
more than 20s. sd. for a share of ss.
par value.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Winchcombe Carson Unsettled
New scope for profit improvement
shares of Winchcombe Carson Ltd
are currently selling below 325. and
the net asset value per share is about
435. 9d. If the convertible notes are
treated as ordinary shares at this stage,
although they do not convert until
December, 1967, the net asset backing
would be 38s. 9d. To many market
observers, this situation would mean that
the company is a target for a takeover
bid and, when the shares rose sharply
to 345. towards the end of the first week
in June, it was apparently because of a
rumor of this nature.
In view of the mergers which have
taken place between pastoral finance
companies, the possibility of Winch-
combe merging with another company
in the same field of activities cannot
be ruled out, but as it is considerably
larger than the others (except Elders and
Dalgetys which represent the “merged”
groups) the possibility of a straight bid
being made by one of them seems rather
remote. On the basis of the latest
published balance sheets, the size of
some of the companies is indicated by
the following figures:
£'ooo
Young-
Lascelles Pitt Son Carson husband
Ordinary capital 764 669 2708 1764
Reserves 846 1337 3257 1112
Loan capital 1772 55
Current liabilities 432 965 4269 1793
Current assets 930 1842 8017 3037
Fixed assets 1024 1130 3947 1687
Earnings 139 107 189 200
Dividends 107 80 217 141
Winchcombe has stated that it is sell-
ing the third largest quantity of wool of
any organisation in Australia, although
the company only operates in New
South Wales and Queensland. While
the asset position would certainly bear
this out, it seems that the profits in
1962-63 would not have qualified for
this position.
In terms of earnings as a percentage
of ordinary capital, after making ad-
justments for new issues and the conver-
tible notes of Winchcombe’s, the follow-
ing pattern emerges when reduced to a
base year of 1959:
1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
Elders 100 123 114 118 159
Dalgetys 100 97 90 78 107

Lascelles 100 137 119 92 110
Pitt Son 100 119 80 85 91
Having noted that Winchcombe’s per-
formance since 1960 seems to have
fallen markedly behind that of the other
five (although all suffered a fall in
1961), it is as well to study the possible
reasons therefor.
It is quite clear that the prime cause
of the fall in earnings adjusted on the
basis outlined above (which treats con-
vertible notes as ordinary shares) was
the issue of convertible notes made in
November/December, 1960. At the
time it might have been regarded as un-
fortunate that this issue was caught by
the “credit squeeze” of November, 1960,
and was only 80 p.c. subscribed. Sub-
sequent events would suggest that it
might have been better if the subscrip-
tion had been much less, because this
capital has not added to the profit since
it was raised. It may be of interest to
examine the balance-sheet changes from
1960 to 1961 to try to see how this
money was used. The Notice to Stock-
holders of October 20, 1960, states
“The purpose of the issue is to meet
the demands of progress and develop-
ment now being made upon the pastoral
industry generally, and the further ex-
pansion of our activities in Queensland
and New South Wales, particularly in
the southern areas of the State”.

I would hesitate to be precise as to
the actual allocation of the various
sources of funds (and I am also aware
of the limitations of this exercise, owing
to the sparse information in the
accounts), yet it would seem fairly
obvious that the funds were required
basically to increase fixed assets. It
seems likely, then, that the expansion
into Goulburn was the reason for
attempting to raise £900,000 in late
1960.
The 1960-61 year also saw the for-
mation of the Executor and Trustee
Department. So far as it is possible to
make out, this venture cost very little
in money terms and for two years
contributed nothing. Did this new ven-
ture divert the attention of management
to such an extent that the basic business
was allowed to run down in terms of
profitability?
The last five years (of which the
1960-61 year is the mid-year) have
seen some fairly extensive changes at
Board level. At the 1958 balance date,
the Board consisted of eight
five of whom were executives of the
company. During the following y ear
one of the “outside” directors died and
another (the chairman) resigned. The
company secretary was appointed to the
Board and this left the Board with only
one “outside” director. It appears then
that a Mr C. A. Wilson was appointed
but his name disappeared during 1961-
62 and Mr Kirkby joined the Board.
Last year, Mr Mountain and Mr Winch-
combe did not seek re-election and it
seems that the Board intends to keep its
number down to six, with Mr Kirkby
as the only “outside” director.
Earlier, the earnings index was given
for six pastoral finance companies. It
must be remembered that prior to the
1961 Companies Act some of these
companies gave very little information
regarding their profits. Even in 1962-
63, tax provisions in some cases seem
to be out of line with the disclosed
earnings figure. This is particularly
noticeable in the case of Winchcombe,
where the tax provided exceeded the
earnings. The dividend record, on the
other hand, is factual and an index of
dividend payout on the same basis
would be as follows:
(1959 = 100)
1960 1961 1962 1963 1964

(a) includes special dividend on merger with
Goldsbrough.
Elders, Dalgetys and Younghusband
have already indicated a 10 p.c. divi-
dend for the current year, Elders and
Younghusband previously paying 8 p.c.
and Dalgetys 9 p.c. Winchcombe has
increased its interim dividend from 3
to 4 p.c. and on the last occasion that
a 4 p.c. interim was paid (March, 1959)
a 6 p.c. final followed. The share lists
appearing in the Press currently show
Winchcombe on an 8 p.c. rate. If the

Lascelles 64/- 4.4
Pitt Son 34/9 3.7
This would mean that if Winchcombe
shares sold at the same price as the
net asset backing of 38s. 9d. the yield
would still be 5.2 p.c., which is attrac-
tive in terms of the other pastoral
finance companies. There seems to be
some scope then for a short term price
improvement.


BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Accounts Clarity Needed
General Credits disappoints investors
As the only one of the bank-backed
hire-purchase financiers to suffer a
major setback at any stage in its career,
General Credits Holdings Ltd has been
something of a disappointment to in-
vestors.
It omitted a final dividend for 1960-
61, when profit dropped severely owing
to an increased volume of repossessed
cars and associated unprofitable insur-
ance business. Losses on property
finance and under guarantees to the
Standard Insurance Co. Ltd also
affected that result.
In the year 1961-62, a loss was in-
curred for the half-year to October,
because of ‘"depressed conditions in the
hire-purchase industry . . . resulting in
materially lower outstandings”, although
the insurance division was profitable.
By the end of that financial year, the
company had recovered to earn a profit
of £167,934, but no dividend was paid
for the year.
In 1962-63 a dividend of 61 p.c. was
possible from profits which showed an
earning rate of 7 p.c. on capital. A
further improvement in profit in the
latest term to April 30, from £240,286
to £259,444, shows a new earning rate
of 7.5 p.c.
Yet even that modest result does not
-look wholly convincing, for, after
striking this profit, £lOO,OOO was trans-
ferred from the appropriation account to
contingencies as a provision for future
bad and doubtful debts. (In 1962-63
a similar appropriation of £150,000 was
made.)
1 However, in the balance sheet this
item does not appear as a reserve or as
a separate provision but receivables are
shown as “amount due and to mature
under current contracts, sundry debtors
and stocks on hand (less provision for
losses)”, which implies that the appro-
priation is already considered as a loss.
The contracts on which forward
charges have been added totalled
£23,160,201 in the latest accounts (1963
£20,926,5 84), less income yet to mature,
£3,021,974 (£2,807,597). Contracts on
which no forward charges have been
added and sundry debtors were
£6,577,075 (£6,000,044).
The combination of hire-purchase and
°lher forms of finance, sundry debtors
and stocks in the accounts like this
tends to cloud the position of each
activity, which shareholders are entitled
to know. Similarly, sundry creditors
and insurance claims admitted but un-
paid are lumped together in the
accounts.
The group now has branches through-
out Australia providing finance for hire-
purchase, leasing, property development,
factoring, home improvements and in-
dustrial equipment.
Amounts payable to the group and by
the group as at April 30 fell into these
terms:

Provision for unexpired insurance
risks and premiums paid in advance
were £1,029,204 in 1964 accounts, com-
pared with £702,860 the year before,
General Credits Ltd was formed in
1953 to provide hire-purchase finance
for consumer and industrial goods.
About 41 p.c. of the issued capital was
taken up by The Commercial Bank of
Australia Ltd. In 1959 it formed two
subsidiaries, Regent Insurance Ltd and
GCL (Wholesale) Pty. In October, 1960,
it acquired The Automobile Fire and
General Insurance Co. of Australia Ltd,
which had had a large and profitable
insurance business for 40 years.
This merger was effected by forma-
tion of the present holding company. It
offered shares to General Credits Ltd
shareholders on a one-for-one exchange,
and to Automobile Fire on a three-for-
two exchange basis. The holding, com-
pany then made a one-for-five par issue
to bring paid capital to its present size
of £3,438,905.
Directors reported that the profit im-
proved by 45 p.c. in the latest year,
before providing for tax. In 1962-63
the insurance subsidiary did not have to
provide for tax, but in 1963-64 £67,000
was necessary. This was largely caused
by an increased retention of motor in-
surance business, which included a
relatively high volume of two-year and
three-year contracts, directors explained.
Tax was required to be paid on these
in the current year, although premiums
are not brought into the year's profit.
Shareholders can therefore expect some
profit improvement in future years.
Tax provision increased from £72,382
in 1963 to £205,969 in the latest term.
The depreciation charge rose from
£259,748 to £607,695.
The company is anxious to diversify
into agricultural machinery, leasing,
factoring and property, and set up a new
company, General Credits (Finance)
Pty, to handle general finance. Compe-
tition in the motor industry remained
keen in 1963-64.
As earnings have given so little
margin to the dividend, reserves of
£200,261 are small in relation to paid
capital. The shares, therefore, do not
command a big premium on the market.
The ss. units currently sell for around
6s. 3d. to yield 5.3 p.c. in income and
a little better in earnings.
The shares remain an uninspiring in-
vestment.

SOUTHERN MOTORS HOLDINGS LTD
Reasonable Income Stock
squeeze put on the economy
generally and motor vehicle industry
in particular in 1960-61 changed the
course of events for Melbourne Holden
and Pontiac dealer, Southern Motors
Holdings Ltd.
In June, 1960, directors told share-
holders they were considering a bonus
issue. After the infamous November
measures, they reported in April, 1961,
they had decided not to make one.
As it happened, their caution was
justified, for profit fell away from the
peak £137,354 in the year to April, 1960,
to £107,681 in 1961 and £49,242 in
1962. This covered the usual dividend
requirement of £40,250 (171 p.c.) with
far less ease than is customary.
The last two years have seen a hard
fight back to pre-recession profit levels.
The latest result of £118,263 is net of
£78,696 tax and £7,031 depreciation.
New earning rate is 43.2 p.c.
During the year, far from receiving
a bonus issue, however, shareholders
were called upon to subscribe to a one-
for-three at par, the first capital move
in the company’s public history. Paid
capital of £306,666 is now supported by
reserves of £660,224, which would pro-
vide the means for a distribution of
largesse sometime in the future.
The present company was formed in
1955 to acquire Southern Motors Pty
which had been the Melbourne metro-
politan distributor for GM-H’s Pontiac
and Oakland cars since 1929. When
Holdens were introduced in 1948,
Southern Motors was appointed one of
the four distributors in Melbourne.
In 1955 it entered the used-car busi-
ness, with lots at Balwyn and St Kilda,
and later Moonee Ponds. During 1963-
64 a Carnegie outlet was established after
the purchase of a property of 31,000
square feet, and premises adjoining the
Blackwood Street premises at North
Melbourne were bought, which will,
after rebuilding, provide a floor area
of 29,000 square feet.
The company also has a hire purchase
subsidiary, Blackwood Investments Pty.
Directors are alert to possibilities for
further extensions of the business in an
expanding market requiring extensive
merchandising, servicing and display
facilities for both new and used motor
vehicles.
The new shares resulting from the
February, 1964, issue ranked for the
final dividend of 10 p.c. The year’s divi-
dend requirement rose from £40,355 to
£48,022. In this current year it will be
£53,666.
The ss. shares now sell for 15s. 6d.
to yield 5.4 p.c. in income and 13.9 p.c.
on earnings. As primarily an incon?
stock, this is reasonable value. Intending
investors, however, should keep in
the sensitivity of all motor stocks to an
unfavorable wind from the Feder
Treasurer.
A clue in that direction may be fortli
coming when the Budget is brough/
down. |

WILLIAM ADAMS AND CO. LTD
Swingalong with Steel
two divisions in which William
A Adams and Co. Ltd proved most
vulnerable in 1961-62, when demand
throughout industry contracted so
sharply, appear to be back to normal in
the latest year to April 30.
Sales of both steel and tractors —the
sensitive divisions—increased 18 p.c. on
1963 figures. Gross profit margins and
expenses were well held. In fact,
expenses generally, expressed as a ratio
to group sales, were lower than last
year.
In 1962-63, steel sales rose by 12.6
p.c. Since expenses were much in line
with 1961-62, net profit showed a sub-
stantial increase. Tractor sales rose
nearly 14 p.c. and, with the drop in the
ratio of expenses to sales, pre-tax pro-
fit in this division improved by almost
100 p.c.
Best improvement in the year under
review was in the engineering division,
where sales jumped 54 p.c. Merchan-
dise sales rose 8 p.c. Total group sales
increased from the 1961-62 recession
figure of £11,673,000 to £13,113,000 in
1962- and £15,729,000, a record, in
1963-
Group profit of £407.169, after tax of
£296,620 and depreciation of £97,013,
exceeded any previous performance, and
represented a 44 p.c. advance on the
1962-63 profit of £282,931. Earning
rate picked up from 18 to 25.1 p.c.
Dividend was accordingly augmented
from lli to 121 p.c.
The company is Australia’s largest
steel merchant and has been operating
since 1884. It supplies commerce, ini
dustry and governments throughout
Australia, from offices in all State capi/
tals and at Newcastle, Wollongong, Kail
goorlie, Townsville and Launceston. Th|
tractor company also has area offices iij
Swan Hill and Horsham (Vic.).
Products of the merchandise division
include electric tools, electrodes ami
welding equipment, engineers’ tools,!
Ferrodor protective paint, industrial
fasteners, tapes, abrasives, and valves
materials handling equipment, pipes and
tubing. The engineering division sup]
plies compressors, diesel engines and
test equipment, machine tools, precision!
chain, pumps and turbines. The tractor,
subsidiary handles Caterpillar tractors'
and ancillary equipment and Hyster in-J
dustrial trucks. The group acts aii
agents for C. A. Parsons and Co. Ltdj
and Sir Howard Grubb Parsons and Co'
Ltd of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
Numerous property changes give evi-
dence of the expanding business: '
• Duplication of the tractor work-
shop at Horsham (Vic.);
• A new steel and bulk warehouse in
Adelaide;
• New facilities at Chester Hill
(NSW);
• A new site of seven acres in Fre-
mantle for the WA branch;
• A new steel warehouse and office B
to be erected in Hobart;


• Duplication of the Melbourne steel
warehouse in the future;
• New quarters, now being planned,
for the Victorian branch of the tractor
company;
• Alterations to the Clayton premises
to house the EDP equipment due in
March, 1965;
• Location of the head office in the
Sydney IBM Centre on a long-term
lease.
The old head office in Clarence Street
has been sold at a satisfactory capital
profit, but the Alexandria property
vacated for Chester Hill has not been
sold yet.
At the end of the current financial
year £600,000 of 6 p.c. notes convert
to shares, which, in the absence of any
capital increase this year, will bring
paid capital, all in ordinary shares, to
£2,285,000. This will take the edge off
the earning rate in 1965-66, because a
dividend of 12k p.c. as is paid today
will require £125,000 before tax,
whereas the current interest commitment
is only £36,000. Another way of look-
ing at it is if those notes were ordinary
capital in 1963-64, the earning rate
would have been just 18.7 p.c.
Considerable profit improvement is
therefore looked for in the next two
years. A necessary prerequisite is con-
tinuation of the healthy economic condi-
tions which industry now enjoys.
The company is sensible of the im-
portance of good public relations and
strong market support for its shares.
No doubt the troughs of 38s. 6d. to
which the shares descended late in 1962
made an impression.
A placement of 125,000 stock units
with Victorian investors was interpreted
as a move to heighten interest on Mel-
bourne market.
At the annual meeting on August 13
a resolution will be put to shareholders
for the subdivision of the 20s. units to
10s. units in view of the impending
change to decimal currency.
Shareholders have had their propor-
tion of capital benefits —a one-for-five
bonus and a two-for-five par issue in
1956, the convertible note issue made in
the ratio one-for-two in 1959, and a
one-for-five par issue in April, 1961.
Dividends of 15 p.c. were the rule
until the stock set-backs in 1961-62,
when only 10 p.c. was paid, with an in-
crease to Ilk p.c. and now 12k p.c. in
the two succeeding years. It seems
desirable to hold the current rate for the
next couple of years, rather than risk
any retrograde step when the notes
mature.
The 4 p.c. yield showing on the cur-
rent market price of 625. (for the 20s.
units) is therefore unlikely to be aug-
mented by any early capital benefit.
Profits now being retained should be
capable of financing present expansion.

BARRETT BURSTON (AUST.) LTD
Good for Most Portfolios
largest malting organisation in
Australia, Barrett Burston (Australia)
Ltd, announced yet another profit in-
crease in respect of trading for the year
to April 30.
Profit rose over the year from
£318,572 to £336,732, after tax of
£248,478 (1962-63, £233,085) and de-
preciation of £99,163 (£99,776).
It was the sixth successive profit in-
crease since the company achieved list-
ing on the Stock Exchange of Melbourne
in 1958.
The company has five malt houses in
Melbourne suburbs and one operated
by the subsidiary Palmerston Properties
Pty, formerly Union Maltings Pty, in
Perth. They supply malt to breweries
and food processors in all States (other
than South Australia and Tasmania) and
also overseas.
Crop faiures in the Northern Hemi-
sphere through drought conditions
brought substantial export orders in the
latter half of Barrett Burston’s year.
Directors expect these exports to be
maintained in the current year despite
keen competition and variable condi-
tions, although they were making no
longer-term predictions.
The company is required to erect silos
at “some considerable expense” during
the current year, as a result of a decision
of the Victorian Government, and direc-
tors stated that this will not necessarily
add to the profit of the company.
Changes in the financial structure of
the group in the last year included an
elimination of the £109,337 overdraft
and its replacement by a cash position
of £200,007. The working capital ratio
improved from 1.5 to 2.0.
To comply with provisions of the
Companies (Public Borrowings) Act
1963, the holding company will change
its balance date from April 30 to January
31 to bring it in line with the sub-
sidiaries. The next accounts will reflect
dividends declared by the operating
companies out of profits they earned
during the year to January.
The company will pay one full year’s
dividend during May next after the
accounts to January 31, 1965, are com-
pleted. Then the practice of paying
interim dividends will be resumed in
November and May.
Shareholders have participated in the
company’s growing prosperity through
dividend increases in each of the last
three years. The latest earning rate of
27.1 p.c. and the company’s very liquid
financial position would permit an issue
of free scrip, although the commitments
for the bulk silos will no doubt defer
such an issue for the time being.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
The Market Dictates to the Investor
What is the office-boy really doing?
HPhe reaction in the market came with
A a vengeance, causing many share
prices to tumble down. When the
market gets a sudden movement like
the present, everyone tries to find the
reason. Once they’ve found one (it does
not matter what it is) they apply it to
the market themselves. So the fall goes
on.
It is a case of the market dictating to
the investor rather than the investor to
the market. In the land of the zany
politician, a professional investor often
employs that doctrine known as the
theory of contrary opinion. An investor
using this theory simply does the
opposite of what most other investors
are doing. One of the brokers from the
Sunny Northern State described it as the
situation when the office-boy is selling
out and the managing director is buying
in.
After reading this introduction, you
might think that I’d be coming into the
market in a big way. However, pur-
chases this week have only been on a
moderate scale. I am gathering all my
funds for an onslaught just prior to the
Budget.
Another onslaught that is taking place
concerns RMC. A number of brokers
have suddenly taken it upon themselves
to advise publicly whether the joint offer
by CSR and Blue Metal should be
accepted or not. By coincidence, the
broker for RMC happens to be advising
against the offer, while one of the
brokers for the offering company is ad-
vising acceptance!
It would seem to me that the offer,
worth about 16s. 6d. for each RMC
share, is a fair one. It is to be remem-
bered that this is after the 2s. return
of capital, so it is equivalent to about
18s. 6d.
Early this year the market price was
12s. 6d. Admittedly, the prospects of the
company were improving at that stage.
Some small rise in market price seemed
likely. Even so, in normal circum-
stances there would still have been a
huge gap between the offer price and
market price. RMC is in a good in-
dustry. One seems a little less certain
about the board that governs the com-
pany. It has adopted some strange
courses of action in the last couple of
years.
All this talk is not getting me any
closer to the market. My only purchase
must just about rate as the highest-
priced share on the market. New Broken
Hill shares at 101 s. are just on 16 times
the par value of ss. sterling. A high
price to pay for 200 shares, but if the
company earns 200 p.c. this year, as it
could well do, it will also prove an
attractive price. It seems almost certain
that the company’s capital will be re-
constructed in the near future; a bonus
issue of anything up to 5-for-l could be
made.
Like North Broken Hill, New Broken
Hill operates a major lead, zinc and
silver mine in Broken Hill. Ore pro-
duction from this mine rose to a record
780,000 tons last year. By 1967, the
annual production figure is expected to
top the 1,000,000 tons mark.
The very high world price of lead,
zinc and silver, rather than output, is
expected to have the most immediate
impact on profits. This was illustrated
in the revenue figures of North Broken
Hill. Gross revenue for the 1963-64
year doubled to £9,000,000, of which
£3,000,000 was earned in the last
quarter.
New Broken Hill balances on Decem-
ber 31, so the full year should have the
benefit of the high world prices. These
prices are materially better than last
year, when the earning rate was 127 p.c.
It was also a quiet week on the
selling side. At long last details of the
offer by Permewan Wright to the Petries
shareholders have been announced. The
offer of one Permewan Wright share and
3s. cash for every Petries share works
out at about 9s. 9d. per share. It is
only a little above the 9s. mark where
the shares have stood for some months.
Consistent selling in that time should
have made me suspicious. All I got out
of holding this share for three months
was a loss of £l9.
The other sale this week was the 500
A. J. Dawson shares at an average price
of 14s. 3d. Quite a good run with these
shares —resulting in a profit of £42. As
a precaution I thought it best to quit my
only motor share. An increase in motor
vehicles sales tax could be on the cards
in the August Budget.
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
200 New Broken Hill, 101/- ... £lO2l
SOLD
500 A. J. Dawson, 14/3 £350
1000 Petries, 9/2 £446
This brings the credit balance up to
an even £2200. Helped along by the tin
shares, the portfolio has climbed a few
pounds ahead of last week.

THE MAN

Marketing Problems for Eggs
Spiking the interstate trade
While wool marketing holds the spot-
light it is interesting to observe that
another farm industry is involved in an
argument over marketing.
This is the egg business.
Now wool has a certain amount of
glamor. It contributes to our national
prestige, it has its. wool barons and its
huge broking houses, it is worthy of
study in our universities.
But eggs? Well, who really DOES
know much about eggs?
Most of us eat at least one a day and,
in all, we buy about £3O million worth
a year.
The egg marketing troubles stem from
the fact that there is little interest over-
seas in buying Australian eggs. What
there is is receding. As for wool, more
than 90 per cent is bought by overseas
buyers.
But Australian poultry farmers pro-
duce more eggs than we Australians
want to eat. Selling some overseas, even
at a loss, is better than dumping.
If we all ate six for breakfast, instead
of two, then the industry’s problem
would disappear. Yet in spite of such
gimmicks as “Humpty Dumpty” eggs for
the youngsters, the plain truth seems to
be that we eat about as many eggs as
can be reasonably expected.
Therefore a plan known as CEMA
(Council of Egg Marketing Authorities)
has been designed to bring stable market-
ing of eggs into being.
To this council belongs the Egg
Marketing Boards in the various States,
plus State and Federal Government
representatives.
As CEMA sees it, the greatest single
obstacle to orderly marketing is the in-
terstate trade in eggs.
What happens is this: Victorian pro-
ducers outside the Egg Marketing
Board’s control send eggs to NSW. Simi-
lar NSW egg “independents” send their
eggs to Victoria. Queensland arid South
Australian counterparts get into the traf-
fic also. Involved deeply in the traffic are
big supermarket chains in the various
States and large department stores
particularly in Sydney and in Melbourne.
Strangely, much of the traffic depends
on a queer kind of psychology evidenced
by the Australian housewife, wherever
she lives.
Eggs sold through Egg Boards are
stamped and often packaged. As every-
one knows, the eggs you buy from a
farm are not.
Therefore, in all these big super-
markets and department stores, you will
find large baskets of eggs with placards
saying: “Farm Eggs”, or “Genuine Farm
Eggs”, “Genuine Farm Fresh Eggs”.
Usually, but not always, they are a little
cheaper than the Egg Board variety.
They are of course really eggs
from interstate. They might even be a
lot older than the Egg Board variety.
Everyone seems happy enough with this
situation.
The housewife has her “farm fresh”
eggs, the, store has big sales, and the
“interstaters” have an outlet without
having to pay levies and marketing
charges to their Egg Board.
It is said that one huge Victorian
poultry farm at Werribee, just outside
Melbourne, supplies most of the eggs
sold in Sydney (city proper) stores. It
is said that the owners inspect their
vast flocks of Leghorns in a Rolls Royce,
that they buy feed in trainloads, and
that savage dogs patrol the fences to
keep out Egg Board inspectors and in-
quisitive persons.
Probably only the first of these things
is true. It is a fact, though, that this
vast project definitely is anti-publicity.


“Man on the Land” feels there is
scope here for a good scriptwriter.
Imagine the possibilities a Marlon
Brando type truck driver speeding
through the night by back roads to
avoid Egg Board patrols; an egg czar
in a Sydney harborside penthouse with
his tentacles spreading from the very
henhouse to the breakfast table in mil-
lions of homes; crafty politicians in the
grip of the egg lobby.
It is enough to make one eat cornies
forever!
Legally the interstate trade is in the
clear per medium of Section 92 of
the Constitution, which says that trade
and commerce between the States shall
be absolutely free.
If returns to the producers who do this
were not greater than returns from the
Egg Boards then the trade would not
exist. It is as simple as that.
But the CEMA plan would impose a
tax on every laying bird and this Hen
Tax would ruin the big interstaters who,
at present, pay no money to their Egg
Boards. To sell eggs in your own State
you must send them to your Egg Board.
Naturally the interstaters are resisting
the CEMA idea which has also been
severely disrupted by the decision of
the South Australian Government.
It wants a poll of poultrymen in
South Australia before agreeing to the
plan. Indications are that South Aus-
tralian poultrymen would vote against
the CEMA plan. An unknown number of
them sell most of their eggs in Victoria.
Opponents of CEMA say that the Egg
Marketing Boards do not truly represent
growers. They say that in most States
producers were not asked if they wanted
Egg Boards.
In Victoria it is claimed that, of the
producers who were in the business in
1937 (when the Board was established),
less than half of one per cent now
remain.
This angle is in itself significant.
Egg Boards were set up to protect
poultrymen against falls in prices which
would drive them out of business.
Certainly the price fluctuations have
been ironed out somewhat. Nevertheless
poultrymen continue to go out of busi-
ness. They are swallowed up by the big
egg “factory” farms which can operate
on much lower costs.
In this sense it may be argued that
Egg Boards have failed in their primary
objective.
On the other side, those poultrymen
who favor CEMA say that the Hen Tax
is only part of the plan.
If brought in, the plan would ensure
that every producer who contributes to
surplus production would also contribute
to the inevitable export loss on that sur-
plus.
This would be fair to all. At present
the “legitimate” farmer who sells through
his Egg Board is penalised by the “inter-
stater” who causes the home surplus.
The plan, it is claimed, would stand-
ardise grades and quality of eggs through-
out Australia, give the producer a better
net return, and stabilise costs.
One of the big factors of egg surpluses,
believe it or not, is the keeping of back-
yard fowls. How many people do this
is anyone’s guess. Certainly it would run
into many thousands.
In the peculiar manner that hens have
the backyard effort always seems to come
at particular periods during the year
When this happens, thousands of people
with a few chooks in the backyard do
not need to buy eggs. When the fowls
are not laying they do.
How CEMA, Egg Boards, or any-
one else, can control this home grown
glut (in the overall picture) remains
unanswered.
Agricultural Revolution
Sod-seeding eliminates ploughing
is possibly the most re-
volutionary thing in agriculture at the
present time. Very simply it means the
sowing of seed without first ploughing
the land.
Instead of the plough, chemical spray-
ers are used to kill off the existing vege-
tation, leaving the soil undisturbed and
ready for planting.
The possibilities of this kind of opera-
tion are limitless. For thousands of years
man has accepted the ritual of plough-
ing the land, cultivating it and returning
it to fallow then to be ploughed again.
Nearly every item of agricultural
machinery is, in one way or another,
based on the assumption that land must
be ploughed.
Tractors, for example, regardless of
the wide variety of other tasks they per-
form, are designed with the thought in
mind that lugging a plough through the
soil is the prime requisite.
If sod-seeding really takes off as its
advocates anticipate, then all this may
change. And the individual farmer will
not have to work so hard.
Tractors and other machinery will be
altered in design to suit the new method
and will certainly be lighter and faster
because ploughing is, of necessity, a
comparatively slow process.
And, most important of all, great areas
of land at present too steep, too hard, or
too wet for the plough may be brought
into production.
The agricultural chemical business
also will expand greatly. Sod-seeding is
being carried out to a degree which indi-
cates real progress in Europe, America
and, on a small scale, in Australia.
At present one of the drawbacks is
that the chemicals required are fairly
expensive. Also some of them are still
in the testing stage.
A foolproof chemical that works
under all soil conditions and vagaries of
weather is not yet available, but there is
no doubt that it soon will be.
When this happens those people who
object to chemicals in agriculture will
have to face the fact that the majority
of the world’s farmers will be breaking
their necks to get the new equipment
and adopt the new method.
Up till now chemicals have been used
for pest and vermin eradication and for
controlling plant diseases.
There are two schools of thought on
the use of chemicals. Objectors agree in
whole, or part, with the book “Silent
Spring” which asserts that mankind is
headed for mass suicide by using chemi-
cals which build up residues in the
human body derived from the chemical
sprays. The chemicals kill wildlife and in-
sects far removed from the particular
pest they are aimed at and this upsets the
balance of nature.
Supporters of chemicals assert that
without their widespread use since the
war, food supplies would already be
threatened. They must be used, they
say, because there is no choice.
A fairly small, but growing, third
group believes that there is a choice and
that biological controls can perform the
same duties without the risks inherent
in chemicals.
It may be true that the age of the
biologist is coming; that he will in the
future be more important to society than
the chemist and physicist. But the
biologist will still be mainly concerned
with controls of pests, vermin and insect
life threatening agricultural production.
If chemical controls may be likened
to an atomic bomb then chemical sod-
seeding is a hydrogen bomb.
Farmers in Australia are not as oblivi-
ous to the dangers of chemicals as some
of the objectors may imagine. The
farmer has to be realistic. Often he
must use the sprays against vermin and
pests and diseases or he simply goes
of business. He is also, in a very real
sense, crying out for information and
advice and is not getting it.
At the last general meeting of the
National Farmers’ Union of Australia it
was decided that the executive conduct
a thorough investigation into the effici-
ency of chemicals in agriculture.
Existing controls and legislation (and
there is an extraordinary array, or rather

Controlling Skeleton Weed
Ecological study still needed
Skeleton weed is a problem in most

control it have not been altogether
[successful.
j The Victorian Wheat and Woolgrow-
' ers’ Association has come up with the
[idea that buffer areas be proclaimed to
| halt the spread of the weed into unaffect-
led areas. The Minister in charge of the
,'CSIRO, Senator Gorton, has replied to
(the Association on this proposal.
He said that research into the control
and eradication of skeleton weed was re-
ceiving the financial support of the Wheat
(industry Research Committee.
The CSIRO was undertaking basic
ecological and physiological studies.
Agronomic and chemical methods of con-
trol were being investigated by appropri-
ate State authorities in Victoria, New
[South Wales and South Australia.
I Senator Gorton disagreed with the
jVWWGA contention that the present
research programme offered little hope
(of success. It was not correct, he said,
jAhat biological control was the only like-
fly solution.
I Research had been going on for only
I a relatively short time, but already valu-
able information had been obtained.
‘ “The planning of the research pro-
gramme has been co-ordinated through
;fhe Australian Agricultural Council and
(its standing committee, with the aid of a
sub-committee representing the CSIRO
( and State departments,” he said.
I “One of the principal functions of the
(sub-committee has been to recommend on
ia priority basis the research to which
Variable funds should be directed.”
The research sub-committee had ex-
amined very closely the question of bio-
logical control.
CSIRO representatives had pointed out
that this type of control, even at the
preliminary investigation stage, would be
costly (about £20,000 a year over a
Period of at least three years). There
"'as no guarantee of success.
The CSIRO experts were of the opin-
ion that the great necessity at present
was a thorough ecological study of the
weed, its distribution, and the factors
which determined its speed and rate of
progress.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
" Woolly Thinking”
On Stocks
Sir,
Under the heading of “Woolly Think-
ing on Marketing” in your issue of
July 11, Mr A. G. Lloyd concludes
his letter with a statement that a
“manipulation” of stocks of wool is not
a valid argument for wool marketing.
However, anything that tends to re-
duce the price of wool, particularly
when it is selling at consumer level at
very high rates, screams out for some
type of wool marketing.
If the consumption of wool was fall-
ing, it would be a natural assumption
that some manufacturers would reduce
stocks. With consumption at very high
levels (and in the UK this year the con-
sumption for January to April was the
highest for the last three years for this
period), any reduction in stocks was a
clear indication that the merchants or
manufacturers were setting a ceiling to
our wool market. It would be quite
obvious that the growers should counter
this move with a “floor” set reasonably
close to the “ceiling”.
Mr Lloyd asks if the UK was the
only “offender”, and the answer is no
she was not. But the UK is the only
country that the writer knows which
promptly gives monthly figures of both
crossbred and merino wool consump-
tion and stocks.
Other offenders were France, stocks
at the end of March down from 119
million lb. to 104 million lb. a year
earlier; and Italy, down from 40 million
lb. to 26 million ib. over the same period.
It could be of interest to note that the
three largest wool stockists in the world
are, in order, the UK, USA and France.
Although these countries only use
approximately one-third of the wool
used in the world, their total stocks are
more than half of known world stocks.
It is sincerely hoped that all wool-
growers will make themselves conver-
sant with the marketing report of the
Wool Board and, now that a decision
has been made, that all growers will
fully support the recommendations
made.
Unfortunately a lot of prominence
was given to a suggested price of 54d.
just after the decision was announced.
From the report it would appear that
this was merely a tentative price sug-
gested, whereas Sir William Gunn had
advised that the price would actually
be set by the marketing authority—
once it was formed —but that initially
the price would be conservative and
that there would only be one movement
for the price and that would be upward.
Any thinking person will appreciate
that a conservative price initially would
be of very great advantage to assist
while any possible “teething troubles”
could be settled satisfactorily.
