HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes
CAUTION. —The large sale of Eumenthol
Jujubes has led to a number of imitations
being manufactured under the name ot
menthol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying to be sure to gee
HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes. Ton may
be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told
they are “just as good” as Hudson s Eumen-
thol Jujubes. This proves that these imita-
tions and substitutes have no reputation or
their own, and can only be sold on the good
repute and high character of Hudson s
Eumenthol Jujubes.
Sold everywhere, tins 1/6; or forward 1/6
in stamps to the Manufacturers, Hudsons

The Last of the Shropshire Lad
That the world is utterly evil is a proposi-
tion we will endure only from a poet or a
seer, not from a mere philosopher. Schopen-
hauer, who was a better man of letters than
a thinker, understood that, and piled up
quotations from the poets to prove his case.
The counter-proposition is one we will
hardly endure from anyone. There is per-
haps nothing so annoying, so distressing and
so certain to get on the nerves as the whole-
hoggery of optimism. A stubborn, healthy
vital instinct makes us prefer the tonic
draught of pessimism—to choose rather with
William James the idea of a universe that
can suffer real losses. It is all a matter
of choice; neither can convince us. If we
are wise, we can find amusement in watching
how they convince themselves, and particu-
larly the last shifts to which they are put
in order to justify their account of the
world’s ways.
Browning was not quite so bad as the
ordinary Browningite would make out with
his perpetual iteration of “God’s in His
Heaven, all’s right with the world.” Brown-
ing made it hard for God. There was 'ori-
ginal sin, the corruption of man’s heart ;
and in the not-inconeeivable case of a stub-
bornly evil soul, like his Count Guido, what
was left if he would not repent? Brown-
ing’s monstrously unorthodox Pope will tell
us - ■
that sad, obscure, sequestered state,
Where God unmakes but to remake the soul.
He else had made in vain—which must not
be. So we breathe again. There is still
dirty work at the front; there is still trouble
for someone in the universe. The scheme of
things is not so appallingly perfect: as the
Shropshire Lad discovered, only with a
difference, “the world it is the old world
J The Shropshire Lad was -always convinced
of the utter evil of things. But where he
was once content to say that “high Heaven
and earth ail from the prime foundation,
he now takes the founder to task. Yet he is
“very sure of God.” For his own ends he
needs a supreme power—not merely because
it is so much more satisfying to berate a
person than an institution. We shall not
understand the hardening of the Shropshire
Lad’s pessimism, the increasingly harsh and
jtcrid quality of his temperament, unless
tve consider the great scholar and pungent
writer of English prose who dwells with him
in one and the same person. The Professor
of Latin at Cambridge must have communi-
cated some of his experience. Now, that
experience (as we have it on the Professor 3
own witness) has been of ,v most-afflicting
kind. For more than 30 ycn-s lie lias born
contemplating the unreason of humanity as
manifested in classical scholarship, and no-
where so grossly—not, he says, in politics,
not in religion, not in tire advertisement ol
patent medicines. For half a lifetime he
has stood forth as wisdom crying in the
streets and none has regarded. “Ten thou-
sand times I’ve done my best, and all’s to
do again.” Human unreason is the incur-
able evil, and the burden of this mystery
rnust be cast off —but where? All the ways
:>f mystery converge; so the Latin Profes-
sor must have his fling at “the jerry-built
edifice of the Demiurge” (“All,” said an-
other Latinist to me, “after abusing every-
body else, he now has to abuse God”), and
the poet just puts the same thing in plainer
English—“ Whatever brute and blackguard
made the world.” It is not satisfying to
tell fools in public what he told his brother
in private. “I had far rather my work was
taken for yours than yours for mine” ; the
-creator of fools must exist —or be invented.
The scholar’s spleen demands at least one
who will hear and understand.
The “Last Poems” of the Shropshire Lad
have not so much of the singing quality as
his earlier verses: —that, of course, was only
to be expected—but there is an increase in
firmness and precision. The phrase is better
spaced, more incisive and memorable. In
a writer who, with all his vast and profound
knowledge of literature, is so wholly original
in mood and tone, and who, though writing
verse from his boyhood, has chosen at 65 to
be represented by just 100 brief poems, it
is risky to attempt to trace influences; but
I think that behind the many obvious sug-
gestions of Heine, Horace and Omar (prin-
cipally in the first volume) pne can detect
an informing spirit, absorbed into the poetry
and pervading it, the high mastery of Calli-
machus, to whose “astringent honey” the
Shropshire Lad’s verse is so akin in flavor.
It is, I repeat, the absorption of a spirit;
tlieio is no imitation, but parallel and equiva-
lent creation —just as the following verses
may remind us of the dirge in “Cymbeline”
and remain an independent thing:—
Soldier from the wars returning,
Spoiler of the taken town,
Here is ease that asks not earning;
Turn you in and sit you down.
Peace is come and wars are over,
Welcome you and welcome all,
While the charger crops the clover
And his bridle hangs in stall.
Now no more of winters biting,
Filth in trench from fall to spring,
Summers full of sweat and fighting,
For the Kesar or the King.
Rest you, charger, rust you, bridle;
Kings and kesars, keep your pay ;
Soldier, sit you down and idle
At the inn of night for aye.
It was a daring and perilous thing to carry
through the poem from which I quoted the
line about the “brute and blackguard.” To
borate the Demiurge because rain has spoilt
your holidav might seem much ado about
a trifle; to do it in the shelter of a tavern
over good ale exposes you to the reminder
that taverns and ale arc not, after all, an
instance of the inherent evil of filings; to
do it in the stately stanza oi. the elegy and
in a biblical strain of language is to invite
anti-climax and bombast. And yet it is done,
and done so magnificently that one cannot
refrain from the remark that the blackest
pessimist must find some consolation jn
being able to produce verse like this: —•
The troubles of our proud and angry dust
Are from eternity and shall not fail.
As likewise in managing ’to get the word
“boose” into high poetry.
So, too, if a poet must renounce his muse
there must be both pride and joy when he
can do it in such a piece of pure poetry
as that which stands at the entrance to
Housman’s last book. Its theme is from
an old French folk-dance. Banville straight-
ened out the metre into stately Alexandrines.
Housman has reverted to the rustic measure
and the wild-wood magic. And what vowels .
We’ll to the woods no more,
The laurels all are cut,
The bowers are bare of bay
That once the Muses wore;
The year draws in the day
And soon will evening shut:
The laurels all are cut,
We’ll to the woods no more.
Oh we’ll no more, no mote
For the Kesar or the King.
To the leafy woods away,
To the high wild woods of laurel
And the bowers of bay no more.
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
Data
Lester Way, Alice Jackson and T. Jasper
have lately effervesced on the influence or
environment on Literature and Art, and with
much show of logic have drawn educational
conclusions therefrom. Having something to
do with education myself, I accuse these
writers of putting the cart before the horse.
As Spencer observed, “the function of edu-
cation is to prepare us for complete living,
and the activities of man embodied m com-
plete living are chronologically these: (1)
Activities of self-preservation ; (2) activities
necessary to procure food, clothes and shel-
ter; (3) rearing and disciplining of offspring ;
(4) activities in proper social and political
relations; (5) activities for gratification ot
tastes and feelings, such as those of art, music
and literature. The tallest spire must have
a base and body betwen the. earth and its
nobility. Even so is it with individuals and
with nations. The most perfect flowers ot
Literature and Art have bloomed in those
nations or peoples whose efforts to provide
for the primary activities of existence have
been successful only when strenuous. In
this struggle for fullest existence, or most
complete living, the relative values of the tae-.
tors are 5 per cent, primeval protoplasm or
nucleus, and 95 per cent, environmental
stimuli which developed and varied the proto-
plasm. No “sport,” whether Pavlovian mouse,
Mendelian sweet-pea, Shakspeare or Christ,
was an effect without a cause, and that cause
an environmental one.
From the science of biology we learn that
a harsh, exacting environment led to the
transformation of the organs of the body.
Striving to obtain food from trees in an
otherwise barren country, the giraffe de-
veloped a long neck, and the elephant a
trunk (Kipling notwithstanding). Simi-
larly, man developed a brain in response
;:o external environmental stimuli, which
stimuli were certainly not governed by “the
utmost kindness, the rarest sympathy, the most
delicate discrimination” that Alice Jackson
■ i nsiders so “vital to the culture of the child
soul.” Alice Jackson’s views, however,
merely exemplify the swing of the pendultim
away from the Christian belief that man is
born sinful. If biology teaches anything, it
teaches that the child is neither angel nor
devil. He is, or should be, a young, reason-
ing animal in whom there is a many-million-
cell brain for reacting to environmental
stimuli which arise from the five-fold activi-
ties of life.
An acute discomfort drove Moses and the
Israelites on their 40 years’ wandering in the
wilderness. Austere conditions in an arid
country conquered by Rome led to that blend-
ing of Oriental asceticism with Stoic philoso-
phy that was the origin of the Christian
belief. Mohammedanism, another offshoot
from the Jewish religion, had its foundation
in adverse economical conditions compelling
a swarming from Arabia that began before
Mohammed, and would have happened with-
out him. Hunger and avarice drove the
Arabs afield, and Old Testament stories
trickling through from Palestine and kneaded
in the dreams of an illiterate epileptic named
Mohammed, supplied the steam. The tre-
mendous influence that this Arab expansion
e-xerted upon the Renaissance, the Reforma-
tion and on the discovery of America is
to-day seldom recognised. Sterile lands
drove Angles, Saxons and Jutes to Britain
(a.d. 400-600). The glory of the Eliza-
bethan era in England arose out of “homely,
frugal conditions of life,” whilst that of
Spain dwindled away in an airtight wealthy
extrovertism. The political and religious
tyranny of the Stuarts drove the Pilgrim
Fathers to America, and thus endowed the
United States with the Anglo-Saxon civilisa-
tion. But it is needless to multiply in-
stances. An exacting environment compels
mankind to look for “a better ’ole” and, hav-
ing found it, to go to it. On the other hand
the decline of ancient kingdoms and empires
exemplifies the ill effects of a prosperous,
“sugary” existence. True, it may be that for
nations, as for individuals, death is inevit-
able, and that the general lassitude resulting
from physical, mental and moral self-indul-
gence is indicative of the approaching dissolu-
tion ; but it is also true that by taking
thought we can postpone that evil day.
Alice Jackson’s encomiums on Greek edu-
cationists tickle m.v palate: Socrates (469-
399 8.C.), Plato (420-348 B.o.) and Aristotle
(384-322 b.c.) were thinkers who saw, de-
plored and tried to avert the general decline
of the Gyeek peoples. Socrates set himself
to break the universal sway of opinion
divorced from reason. Plato looked back to
that fifth century 8.C., and moaned: —
Now the schoolmaster is afraid of his pupils, and
flatters them, and the pupils despise both school-
master and pedagogue. The young expect the same
treatment as the old, and contradict them and
quarrel with them. In fact, Seniors have to flatter
their Juniors in order not to be thought morose old
dotards. The temper of their resolution has been
melted away by their exclusive devotion to intel-
lectual and artistic pursuits.
Aristophanes (“Clouds”) also looked back to
that early period “when children were seen
and not heard... .when they got tremendous
thrashings for disrespect to the Muses. Chil-
dren then behaved modestly and did not

spend time ogling their admirers. At meals
they were not allowed to grab up the dainties
or giggle or cross their feet.” It was in the
period of juvenile emancipation and increas-
ing luxury and indulgence for children which
marked the later years of the fifth century
that Plato exclaimed: “The whole life ol
man stands in need of grace and harmony.
A further note on these Greek schools may
be worth while. The school day began at
sunrise and closed at sunset. Counting was
done by means of fingers and pebbles. The
occupation of schoolmaster was a despised
one. The worst punishment that Lucian
could devise for wicked kings was that they
should be compelled in the future state to
teach the elements of reading and writing.
Girls sat at home, and, "as far as
could be managed, were not allowed to
see anything, hear anything or ask any
questions.” Xenophon speaks of a girl
wife of 15 years “gradually becoming
sufficiently tame to hold converse with her
husband.” Lastly, with regard to punish-
ment, I cannot forbear thik sample from
ilerondas. A mother, Metrotime, brings her
truant boy, Kottalos, to his schoolmaster,
Lampriskos, to receive a flogging. She. com-
plains that the boy has misbehaved himself
in various ways, and the story continues: —
Mi:trotime: He knows
The seventh and the twentieth of the month,
Whole holidays as if he read the stars;
He lies awake o’ nights adreaming of them.
Kut so may yonder Muses prosper you,
Give him in stripes no less than - ——
Lami'Riskos: Right you are.
Here, Euthias, Kokkalos and Phillos, hoist him
Upon your backs. I like your goings on.
My boy. I’ll teach you manners. Where’s my
strap ?
The stinging cow’s tail.
Kottalos: Kv the Muses, Sir,
Not with the stinger!
I,am. : Then you shouldn’t be so naughty!
Kott. : Oh, how many will you give me?
Ram: Your mother fixes that.
Kott. : How many, Mother ?
Met. : As many as your wicked hide can bear.
Kott. : Stop. .. .that’s enough ! Stop !
Lam. : You should stop your ways.
Kott. : I’ll never do it more, I promise you.
Lam. : Don’t talk so much.. . .
Kott. : I won’t talk, only do not kill me, please.
Lam.: Let him down, boys.
Met.: No, leather him till sunset.
Lam. : Why, he is as mottled as a watersnake.
Met.: Well, when he’s done his reading, good or bad,
Give him a trifle more, say twenty strokes.
These few grains I offer as data whereby
Lester Way. Alice Jackson and T. Jasper
may tost their hypotheses.
M. G.
The Dynasts and Shakspeare
One of the notable features about Thomas
Hardy’s great epic-drama “The Dynasts" is
its modern atmosphere. In ancient epic-
drama—in the “Iliad,” for instance —the
deities played a tremendous part in the do-
ings of the mortals. The deeds of those
mortals were wholly legendary. History
carried on only by word of mouth grew into
legends, and in those legends the gods, look-
ing down upon the heroes of them, interfered
at will. Thus the mortals were robbed of
all responsibility and practically all human-
ity. The heroes could not very well be con-
sidered heroic when they were god-protected
and god-directed. It was easy enough, for
instance, for Achilles to be brave when he
only had to keep that heel of his covered to
he perfectly safe in any combat. The gods
vhemselves, with their passions and jealousies,
were really more human than the mortals.
And great Jove himself was only a very
powerful one of them. In Hardy's work the
deeds of the mortals rare not legendary; they
are, in fact, almost too historic. The spirits
who take the places of the watching deities
are no longer empowered to interfere in the
doings of those mortals. They can only
look on and commeut. ironically, pityingly,
pessimistically, according to whether they
be the Sinister spj rits, the spirits of the
Pities or tin; spirits of the Years. And the
great -spirit behind them, and the mortals
too, they refer to as: “the Will.” “the Urging
Immanence,” “It.” This spirit does not
appear at all, but is referred to and sug-
gested, and is not all-seeing or all-powerful.
The Sinister spirit, in fact, refers to it as
“the dreaming, dumb. dark thing that turns
the handle of the) idle Show.” Hardy, con-
tending that the. age has advanced beyond
such conceptions (and in this he sets us
remembering that he was at his impression-
able prime whej i men like Huxley and
Herbert Spenceri were swaying the thought,
of the world), twill not have this spirit
anthropomorphic? in any way. Pie will not
even use the masculine pronoun in alluding
to it. He never, calls it God.
It is very interesting to compare Hardy's
treatment of his' historic subject in this work
with Shakspears's treatment of historic sub-
jects. There is a vast difference: in fact,
they take us li ack to those once so-much-
fought-over worlds “subjective” and “objec-
tive.” Hardy is an artist first of all. a his-
torian secondly, a poet, lastly. Shakspeare
is first and forei nost a poet, secondly an artist,
and a historia u easily last of all. Hardy
takes the conventional ideas of the different
characters he deals with and paints with
wonderful art: those ideas. He does not
exaggerate or e mphasise. His characters arc
as history has giyem us to believe they were.
We see their faces, their limbs, the uniforms
they wore, and all the time the glittering
background of the age in which they lived.
Shakspeare doets not go nearly so far in these
particulars. He i s almost wholly taken
up with creating new minds for long-
dead characters, and thus creating new
characters. 'The re suit is that, whereas
Hardy succeeds in keeping himself out of
"The Dynasts,” in nil Slnikspeare’s plays,
historical or romantic., .there is a tremendous
lot of himsglif. Hamh»t and Macbeth, for in-
stance. ares a thousand times more Shaks-
peare than the historfte characters who ages
ago bore those names. In all the plays where
the kings -appear thei}e are characters more
important than the kings—characters of
whom in the majority .'of cases history barely
makes monition at al'l. Nietzsche says that
“the poet acts sham elessly towards his ex-
periences: he exploits them.” That is what
Shakspeare does. He > has never met a King
Henry IV.. for insta tice. but lie has met a
P alstaff. Falstaff is i one of his own life-
experiences, so Falstaff becomes the most
important character in “Henry IV.” Then
Shakspeare’s Cleopal ra is not the conven-
tional Cleopatra of history, nor is she a
mouthpiece for a philosophy, as is Bernard
Shaw’s Cleopatra. She is just a woman
Shakspeare has happened to come across on
his journey through life; wherefore she is
intensely human. In Hai’dy’s epic-drama
the historical picture is the first thing striven
after; the individual men and women in it
are only incidental to the whole. _As they
move by beneath the watching spirits they
are less like living people than like actors
playing great parts in a vast play. „ .
Hardy’s blank verse in “The Dynasts_ is
often reminiscent of Shakspeare s. Oneteeis
that he must have steeped himself in Ham-
let” before he began to write. Lines like
“Great men are meteors that consume them-
selves to light the earth” are in both sound
and mental quality quite Shakspearean. But
if his lines flow just as easily as Shakspeare s.
there is never the tremendous rise and tall
with the action that Shakspeare could com-
mand. Hardy’s verse flows easily and swiftly
like a river: Shakspeare s moves more like
fire. It flickers and flutters, races fiercely,
smoulders, is just a calm, warming blaze,
and it never dies out. It is the perfect
medium for emotion and passion. Josephine s
last words in the passage beginning “I am
dying, dears,” are beautiful, but they lack
the poignancy of Hamlet’s “O, I die,
Horatio.” Then Napoleon s soliloquy be-
ginning
Why am I here?
Bv laws imposed on me inexorably.
History makes vise of me to weave her web
To the long while aforetime-figured mesh
And contemplated charaetery
is magnificent, hut comparison only servos
to show how much more magnificent is f lam-
let's “to he or not to be.” .
It is curious to note the many like ideas
there are newly expressed in this play and in
Shakspeare’s. " In one passage the spirit ot
<lie Years says of Napoleon:
Such men as thou, who wade across the world
To make an epoch. 1 dess, confuse, appal,
Are in the elemental ages’ chart
Like merest insects on obscurest leaves,
lint incidents and grooves of Earth s union ling ,
Or as the brazen rod that stirs the fire
Because it must.
And Shakspeare said of Osar that “He o er-
stridos the narrow world like a Colossus,
and that “Great Nature does with us as we
with torches do, not light them tor them-
selves.” ~ .
The main interest of “The Dynasts is m
the storv it tells, and that interest is all-
ahsorbing. Truth is said to he stranger than
fiction. On some occasions it is certainly
more thrilling, and it is doubtful if &ny of
the ancient legends or any fiction that has
come into being since those ancient times is
quite so thrilling as the true story told m
this work. All in his own way Hardy has
done the storytelling magnificently. Mann-
ing all apart with the spirits who watch, lie
unrolls scene after scene—battles all over
Europe, courts in every capital, the dramatic
rise and just as dramatic fall of Napoleon —
all brilliantly drawn, some glittering, some
sombre, all vital. “The Dynasts” is likely to
find its wav further into the future than any
of Hardv’s novels, great though those novels
are.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
’Arris, Editor
Of old sat editors on the heights, the
thunders breaking at their feet. The type
was that of a revered and frequently reverend
person accredited with a universality ot
knowledge, to whom, in an immeasurably
wider sense than to Silas Wegg. all print
was open. He was an honored guest at Gov-
ernment House and the banquets, where, as
in all company, lie seemed to stand daised
above the crowd, elevated in virtue ot a con-
ceded mysterious superiority. In the news-
paper office, even more noticeably than else-
where, he moved apart and aloof. To say
that the editor wished something done was
to see it done, to get his opinion on a topic
to annihilate argument thereon. Sometimes
he wrote a leading article, in which event
the haggard and domineering Printer was
relieved of doubt as to which sample of what
the •'comps” irreverently called “brains
should be placed first, since the editor’s was
necessarily the “leader.” This editor held
daily conferences with encyclopedic persons
called leader-writers, at which feasts of reason
affairs bursting with pith and moment to the
country and the world were arranged to be
pronounced upon as by his Majesty s Privy
Council. He was not a newspaper man. but
a journalist; there is all the difference, as
a wise Yankee has recently shown. He wrote
or ordered to be written. What he didn t
know about news and the arrangement thereof
was all that there is to know about such
things. Were there not sub-editors and re-
porters and proof-readers to attend to such
necessary incidentals, just as there were
cooks and other strivers to look after equi-
valent. affairs in his home or his club?
He has gone, that august aristocrat—from
the profane press, that is. Able editors ot
potency and severity, but incomparably less
Jovian than their predecessors, are still to
be found on certain papers; but the typical
person in “the chair” is more frequently a
super news- or sub-editor who mixes in the
daily dust-up with the ruck and rouseabouts
of the staff, whose members frankly and
openly recognise him as fallible like them-
selves. Here and there shreds of his proto-
type’s gone greatness still flutter in the wind.
The youthful son of one editor, visiting his
father not long ago. was planted in an outer
room where one of those ebullient imps to
whom as to fretful women newspaper offices
seem irresistible, engaged him in inquisitorial
conversation, and presently demanded tc
know who he was. “My name’s Potts,” said
the little Crown Prince. “Gee!” exclaimed
the imp, limp at the discovery that he had
been so familiar with vicarious greatness;
“I didn’t know. Why, Mr. Potts he s the
Head Boss of all!” But to the gang Potts
is no head boss—only the ganger. Asking
respectfully for my friend Mr. Murphy, the
editor, one day recently, I was told by a
junior reporter, “Mick doesn t come in till
about 6 o’clock.” Vanished with other edi-
torial pomp and circumstance is the diurnal
conference with the know-alls who wrote
what the letters to the editor describe as
“the able leader appearing in your issue
of yesterday.” The “leader” certainly sur-
vives in its former stateliness and frock-
coat length in a good many sheets, and almost
invariably follows the fine Australian tradi-
tion that the writer shall either be well in-
formed upon his subject or shall “look it
up” with industry and intelligence. But
more often it is thought as little of as Father
in the growing-up family. The so-called edi-
tor meets his writer in a corridor and
arranges with him to “do something” in a
pot-shot form about the Rocks or the Ruhr,
then bustles on his way to look over to-day's
more important stuff and the stream-line head
for it—in short, the story of that tragedy
at Five Corners.
But there is One Above, all the same.
The Managing Editor, more powerful though
less a personality than the late lamented
Editor. He controls the business side as
well as the pale “policy of the paper,” being
double-headed. He provides both billets and
bullets, and mars or makes those who are
on the staff or pifte to get there. He is
seen on behalf of the paper at the more
succulent banquets and on all ceremonious
occasions except those which he deigns to
pass on to ’Arris, the nominal editor: and
betimes he dickers for newsprint, fixes adver-
tising rates, reorganises the machine-room
with writs of ejection, and uses big, hot
words to assembled newsagents. Very often
he is a pressman of sorts who, having been
through the mill, has prudently taken the
tip of the American ex-journalist who in his
business scampers through Maoriland used
to burst into a newspaper office and ask the
men, “Why don’t ye escape?” The Manag-
ing Editor has risen to higher things, though
in many cases he would have been fired out
had he stuck to lower. Nine times out of
ten lie is as much a man and brother as
can reasonably be expected of such a high-
geared potentate.
All said and done, the Able Editor has
gone and ’Arris is coming for the general
good. A newspaper tends by such revolu-
tions to become the news-paper that it should
be, and its nominal head is, therefore, pro-
perly a working news-man. The circum-
stance that so many of the earlier editors
were parsons or ex-parsons perhaps accounts
for the habit of their papers to preach, and
of the editor to fancy himself back in the
pulpit. That went well enough when so many
people never thought, of thinking for them-
selves at all. but took their politics and
their outlook generally from the printed
word. Of course, it is still true, and may
always be, that what people like to read is
what they think, or think they think. But
increasingly more of them are mentally self-
reliant and independent, and promptly revolt,
at anything which cuts across the grain of
their thought or interest or prejudice. As
with the old original pulpit, so with its imi-
tator, the lecturing and hectoring news-
paper; both are being booted to the edge
of disuetude by a generation which will not
be preached at.
H. J. T.
A Satchel of Books
Tales from Turkestan, by Stor Lob (Blackwood).
Well-told war stories, most of which have appeared in
Blackwood’s Magazine. The last, and not the worst,
deals with the exploits of a company of Punjabis at
Festubert.
Murder and Its Motives, by F. Tennyson Jesse
(Heinemann). This hook comprises six studies of
murders classified by motive. All murders, says the
writer, are for gain, revenge, elimination, jealousy,
lust of killing or conviction ; and some may be traced
to several of these causes. She demonstrates her
theory by studies of six types, ranging from Palmer,
the atrocious Rugeley doctor who poisoned on a
wholesale scale, his victims including five oi im>
own children (gain and elimination), to Omni, w
threw a bomb at Napoleon 111. and killed a number
of bystanders (conviction). There are beings w
may be termed accidental murderers, oucn a 01
was Constance Kent, who in a fit of jealousy cut
her baby-brother’s throat, but later repented, confessed,
and, after leaving prison, lived an exemplary lire.
The congenital assassin is not hard to identity; no
has been the same in all the ages During the
trial of Aimee Roussel for the murder of her husband,
Perrot, the skull of the dead man was brought
into court and mounted on a little pedestal, blit,
was told to remove her head-dress. “This she had no
objection to doing, but she feared for her exquisite
lace and muslin coif, and, taking it off, she, l°okei
round for somewhere to put it out of harm s wa v,
and finding nothing better for her purpose than the
skull of her husband, she placidly made use ot it
as a milliner’s dummy.” Similarly the Chicago boy-
murderers whose exploits recently horrified the woiiu
ate sandwiches with the body of their late trien
lying on the floor of their ear, and they displayed,
too, the vanity which is the hall-mark of congenital
criminals.
More Obiter Dicta, by Augustine Birrell (Heine-
mann). Another collection by the most charming
of England’s living essayists. Most of them have
appeared in the Times, Westminster Gazette and
other London papers, and some date back to tne
early ’nineties.
Memorial History of Melbourne, by Isaac Selby.
After years of alternately “financing and writing,
here at last it is; 500 quarto pages in strong cover,
a handsome volume, with 280 photo-engravings, the
author voluminously traces history from the discovery
of Port Phillip to the World War.. His caption, l .ie
Origin of a Great City Seen Through an Old ( eme-
tery,” explains the inspiration of the annals. Scrappy
as the work is, it is really more interesting than
many a pompous attempt at history because moi e
personal and less pedagogic, though Isaac lniuseit
must have been born gloomy. His wealth ot obiter
dicta can be read with instructive enjoyment, paren-
thetical as are its reflections, and though the reader
gets horrible confused as to which is which between
substance and addenda. It is just this generally
quite unpardonable literary defect that grows upon
the reader and gives Selby’s gossip a charm all its
own. He is- a chatterbox grown-up and full ; he
chatters refreshingly if platitudinously on music,
mimes, painting and authorship, and of men and
women he associates therewith. Celebrities and
nonentities share equally the honors of records and
recollections. The toil spent upon the work must
have been tremendous, and nobody would be dis-
pleased if the author got some reward for his
pains. His emotions apparently overpowered him
on the last page, for he gives us this intriguing
passage: “There is an occult influence in the life ot
Melbourne that I have not attempted to follow,
because I do not understand it, and am not under
its influence, but have often felt it operate against
me. This narrative I have written in memory ot
better times. Let those who know the other tell the
storv- of mysterious Melbourne.” Rut what mystery
Isaac- Selby could himself uncoil out of the dark if
liis quaint' and questing pilgrimage were translated
into type!
*
“R.S.R.”: One man, I’ll wager, would read more
avidly than most Richard Meredith’s “Saint Joan"
(rjj. 7 /8/’24), and that one Charles MacLaurin,
author of “Post Mortem,” that slashing series of
penetrative essays which do our country credit criti-
cally and otherwise. A fascinating study in that book
is “The Problem of Jeanne d’Arc.” Has Shaw seen
it? One speculates whether Joan’s “voices” would
have been so sublimated if the greatest Shavian of
them all had known as much as “C. McL.” Bui-
then, would Shaw himself seem as great if the
devotees knew as much as those terrible fellows the
doctors know? Bad enough to have them treating
us privately without also diagnosing our heroes in
public! Since I read “The Doctor Looks at Litera-
ture” the genius of D. H. Lawrence has been spoilt
for ine. I always now see it as through a glass
darkly.


Buyers of Fords!
Having purchased your car, the next most important matter
is to procure a
Oiling System Speedometer
Right from the start you should keep a reliable check
on your running expenses; you should know exactly
the petrol and oil consumption, what mileage you
get from your tyres, what speed you are making, and
what distance you cover on each trip.
The STEWART OILING SYSTE.M SPEED-
OMETER will give you all this information, and
much more—-
IT WILL TELL YOU JUST WHEN AND WHERE
TO OIL AND GREASE THE DIFFERENT PARTS.
READ HOW IT WORKS:
At regular intervals a colored numeral turns up in the total register and
automatically warns the driver that some part requires oil or grease;
a reference to the metal chart suspended from the instrument tells what
part it is.
The chart is also supplied in pocket-book form with each speedometer.
The booklet contains hints concerning lubrication, and pages for recording
tyre and petrol expenses.

Winter Night.
The gracious moon had thrown her gems
As alms to the poor world below ;
The tall trees borne on silver stems
Were crowned with shining diadems
And the grey fences seemed to glow.
Thin violet vapors from the plain
Crept, luminous, up the shadowy hill;
And, panting pearl, I saw the train
Fade round the curve and flash again
A thing of splendid light and will.
Beyond the droop of magic oaks
And spires of spangled turpentine
The little breezes could not coax
One upward drift for those blue smokes
Suspended in the leafless vine.
But lioney-yellow were the lamps
That gleamed across the lattice bars,
Crying to every light that tramps
Behind the moon through frosty damps
Their pity of the homeless stars.
For* all her radiant attire,
A melancholy held the night.
The sad trees wept for Springs desire;
But summer mirth of scented fire
Filled one small room with laughing light.

Storm at Night.
Reef and beach are washed with white,
Roaring rollers shoreward come,
Beauty walks not here to night,
Music’s golden mouth is dumb.
Yonder, somewhere in the dark
Far beyond my vision's ken,
Scuds a hunted, harried barque
Manned by pallid sailormen.
Hopeless, helpless is her plight,
Waves behind and rocks before;
Ilarbor-light and window-light
Ship and crew shall see no more.
Buoy and haven, hearth and home
They shall never, never see. . . .
Timbers tossed upon the, foam,
Bodies drifting lividly.
Foams the breaker on the bar.
Speeds the sea-spray, salt and wan :
Last of sun, and last of star,
Ship and crew have looked upon.
Charging shoreward in the dark
Billows roar and roar again;
Doomward scuds a stricken barque
Manned by pallid sailormen.

The Adventurers.
You want to go adventuring? Why, T
Can show a path that leads into the sky
Right over that brown hill,
Where we can turn at will
Through sunny lanes and in the twilights
g re y
Review the happy chapter of each day.
In both those small ears you’ll have rings to
wear .
And with a crimson kerchief bind your hair;
But I will take our pack
Upon my broader back.
The while you carry flute and fiddle down
The dusty roads into a liarbor-town.
We’ll watch the big ships breast the swelling
seas.
Smell oil and tar upon the busy quays
And hear tanned seamen tell
Of strange things that befell.
But at the story’s end will ever turn.
Feeling our roving hearts begin to yearn :
For we will see grey winter passing by
And. at the breath of Spring, the blossoms die
On the bent wattle-bough.
Unless we hasten now
We shall miss all that dear, familiar scent —
The gold on mist-green leaves is well-nigh
spent.
And we shall love beyond the ships and sea
The crooning of each big, slow-moving tree
That bends to watch below
Creek-shadows come and go.
Deep in the scrub will sound bird-melodies
And fragrant smoke come curling with the
breeze.
With eyes that narrow till the lashes meet
We shall gaze far beyond the unpaved street
Of one small country town
To where the tall hills frown,
Seeing betwixt their wooded flanks betimes
The smoke-pink bridle-path that upward
climbs!
Oh, child o’ mine, if yours is discontent
For being stay-at-home, I, too. have spent
Vain yearning hours that sped
My eager thoughts ahead
Of uncongenial tasks to paths and streams
Beckoning Adventure weaves into my dreams.

GOING TO THE PACK.
Man began as a pure Communist, a hunter
in the pack, taking his share of the nuts
and bones Avith a greedy hand and mouth,
but recognising that as one of the mob he
was safer and less hungry than he ever could
be pitting his single nakedness against the
dangers of the wild. The pack had a leader
who was individual in his thought to a
degree, but as much dependent on the sup-
port of his folloAvers as they were upon
his leadership; and the business of deposing
a leader and submitting to a new one in-
volved a hungry and dangerous time. Indi-
vidual thought and action came at a much
later period, when hunting had largely given
place to settlement on the soil, and the dan-
gers had been reduced by experience and the
invention of weapons of defence. With the
establishment of early civilisation the indi-
vidual counted more and more; but the exist-
ence of settled communities side by side with
nomadic adventurers led to a change. The
combination necessary for effective warfare
Avas greatest with those who still kept some
semblance of the original pack; and the
trained and more or less cultured war-pack
became the ideal of the conquering nations.
This led to the introduction of the pack sys-
tem in industry through the capture of slaves
in war * and the great Oriental despotisms
of the Old World grew into strange forms.
At the head of all was the despot himself,
more or less under the power of the priest-
hood, but in most things free to exercise his
will. Around him were a limited number
of free families in complete subjection to the
Sovereign, but allowed to exercise their in-
dividualism in a limited sphere which did not
encroach upon the functions of the State.
The real work of the country Avas done by
a horde of slaves joined in a commune of
misery or treated with a semi-patriarclial
consideration as possessing about the value
of good horses and cattle. Every State at
the beginning of European history possessed
slaves, but in places the free workman existed
side by side Avith the bondsman; and the
measure of the importance of any nation of
antiquity can be pretty accurately gauged
by the extent to which its free population
acted upon its own initiative. Individual-
ism was, in fact, the mark of national pro-
gress ; but many States from time to time
reverted to the pack idea and snatched a
short-lived success by doing so. Athens and
Sparta present the strongest contrast in this
respect. Sparta was organised as a pack;
Athens allowed freer play for the individual.
As far as poAver and territorial advantage
went, both had about equal success, though
the individualism of Athens saved Greece in
the Persian crisis; but judged by higher
standards, the Athenian is still a power in
the world, while the Spartan is remembered
only for a single foolhardy military exploit.
Rome was the most individualistic of all
States up to the death of Julius; and from
first to last, even in her years of decay, the
man counted more than the mob, and the
individual distinction of a great citizen often
overshadowed the figurehead Caesar wearing
the purple. The fall and disintegration of
the Roman Empire hurled the countless
slaves of all colors and nationalities into the
general body of the Italian people; and new
barbarous populations from the North poured
into the peninsula. Individualism almost
died with the old civilisation, though it pre-
served a precarious life in the Church, which
Avas theoretically’ the most Communistic
organisation of all.
•:f if *
The. Middle Ages practically repeated the
history of primitive man, but Avith the differ-
ence that behind them always glimmered the
lights of the greater past. Hunting packs of
men roamed; Europe and the northern seas;
but sporadic growths of civilisation appeared
here and there amid the confusion. Gradu-
ally the nations took form as someAvhat dis-
ordered despotisms; and a struggle for free-
dom began Avliicli has lasted down to our
own day. That struggle for freedom was
largely an assertion of the individual over
the commune and based upon a determina-
tion that the pack interests should not en-
tirely destroy human initiative. Parlia-
ments grew and kings dAvindled; commerce
and invention altered the face of the lands
until the world was full of open doors for
the poorest, and individualism covered the
whole ground of practical thought. But the
heights to which individuals attained created
huge discontent; and the Avorld set itself the
task of finding short-cuts to some vague
human goal Avlicre all should be on the heights
to which the few had climbed. The economic
condition which had accentuated the differ-
ence between rich and poor provided the
chief argument for the reformers. General
education at the State’s expense looked cap-
able of lifting the mass of the people in a
single generation. But no thought had been
given to the fact that education is for those
who seek it rather than for those who have
it thrust upon them, though the countless
uneducated persons of wealth and educa-
tional opportunity might Avell have made the
reformers think. Looking back on the ex-
periment, it now seems clear that the pro-
portion of people who show individual dis-
tinction has not risen since the whole popu-
lations of great countries were started by
laAv on the road to learning. There are
certainly more people Avho can read and
Avrite, but it is doubtful if there are more
people proportionally avlio, at any rate, Avrite
anything worth while; and State instruction
has done little to raise the general standard
of life and citizenship. On the other hand,
the great handicrafts—themselves a mental
and moral training—have seriously declined.
There are far more people who can read a
newspaper or a cheap novel, but far fewer
people who can turn out a perfect piece of
Avorkmanship. When the failure to lift the
Avorld by general education became appa-
rent, another short-cut to perfection Avas sug-
gested. It was declared that the worker’s
lack of leisure in which to develop his indi-
viduality prevented his rising to his full
heights. Leisure has been granted; hours
of labor have been shortened greatly. The
result shows no real improvement. Such ex-
periments cast the gravest doubts upon all
other short-cuts that may be proposed.
* * •* *
Before Australians, as before the people
of most lands, there is the definite proposal
to return to the pack system and substitute
Communism for the present potential indi-
vi dualism, to share and share alike in all
things, and to make easy the path for the
weak and incompetent. It is a pleasing pro-
posal to the weak and incompetent, and still
more pleasing to the idle; but the idea is
fiercely combated by most of those who have
made anything worth while of their indivi-
dual effort. To the lone hunter of life’s
prizes a return to the pack is unthinkable,
so much so that the phrase “gone to the
pack” has grown up as a fitting description
of the man who is no longer of account
among his striving fellows. But AA T liile the
idea of an economic and social commune *
most distasteful, there are tens of thousands
of its bitterest opponents Avho lend it con-
tinual support by all their actions outside
the economic sphere. In all Avorld move-
ments there is a spirit Avliicli foreruns the
events themselves. Before the French Re-
volution there was a strange unrest in the
nation. Old views of philosophy and life
were being turned upside down by the very
people Avho were struck hardest by the Re-
volution itself. Something of the same kind
appears to be taking place in Australia.
Mentally, a vast number of people have
already dropped back into the pack and seem
content to remain there. They desire no in-
tellectual stimulus; they feel no national
pride; they accept their ideas from illus-
trated publications produced in America.
This may be due to an after-tlie-war lassi-
tude, but the evidences of it are on every
side. Nothing Australian matters much; a
foreign picture film will kill time as Avell as
anything else; politics are a bore, and some-
body else can settle our problems for us.
Twenty years ago the Henry Lawson
memorial fund would have stirred the conti-
nent to its centre; now it brings in only a
few sparse subscriptions from a heedless
public. The state of affairs is made evident
by the present Parliamentary leadership.
The pack does not care; let anybody who will
do the job. This is the very spirit of that
Communism which is clamoring at the gate
for a trial. To take life along the line of
least resistance and accept a place in the
pack is to give up most that has been gained.
Australia is a land of opportunity, but the
first opportunity it offers is plenty of room
for mental sloth. The pack when gorged
goes to sleep; perhaps the times are too easy.
SYDNEY’S MUNICIPAL TRIBULATION.
Early in its unthrilling career the N. S.
Wales Fuller Government promised to abol-
ish the lodger franchise, by means of which
a so-called municipal Labor party captured
Sydney in 1918 and ran it for three years
as if it were a conquered city. Having given
this undertaking the Government, which is
elderly and torpid, dropped the subject for
two years. Returning to it last month, as
a result of urgent representations to the
effect that the municipal elections were due
on December 1, and that the Conditions,
if unaltered, would be all in favor of Tam-
many, the old gentlemen in office discovered
that the cancellation of the lodger vote,
which doesn’t exist in any other N. S. Wales
municipality, would involve a struggle not
only with the Opposition, but also with mem-
bers of their own party who sit for metro-
politan constituencies. So their courage
oozed out of them, and the doss-house fran-
chise is to remain. All that has been be-
latedly provided for is a redistribution of
the 13 city wards. When this was sug-
gested in the Leg. Assembly the stern and
unbending Administration of two years ago
was most obliging. On a Labor member pro-
testing that a 5 p.c. margin above or below
the quota proposed in the bill would be
unfair to the inhabitants of Union-street,
Pyrmont, and Bourke-street, Woolloomooloo,
the Minister in charge of the measure said,
“Very well, we’ll make it 10 per cent.”
And 10 per cent, it is to be.
* * * *
There can be no argument against redistri-
bution, for the present arrangement of boun-
daries is grotesque. For example, Labor
Pyrmont, with 1839 electors (largely lodg-
ers), and Labor Denison, with 2253, return
twice as many aldermen as non-Labor
Bourke, where the enrolment is 5074. Gipps
and Belmore, two other Labor strongholds,
have 2518 and 2625 voters respectively,
whereas there are 4891 in Flinders, 4629 in
Fitzroy and 4404 in Bligh. But the position
is by no means hopeless for the crowd which
has had the benefit of these “anomalies,” as
they are politely called, although redistribu-
tion, even with a 10 per cent, margin, can
do it no good. Its policy, which is a blend
of Tammany paternalism and syndicalism
(“the municipality for the municipal em-
ployees” ), commands the active support of
a large class inspired by memories of oast
favors and by hopes of many to come. The
municipal laborers organised in a Labor union
form a considerable proportion of the 44,000
electors enrolled ; and, although the st aff has
been so multiplied of recent years that the
wages bill soared from £445,964 in 1918 to
£999,431 in 1921, room would doubtless be
found for numerous denizens of doss-houses
if their exertions at the ballot-box were effec-
tual. On the other hand the Civic Reform
party, which was returned with a good majo-
rity in 1921, is divided into two camps, and
the Government, like Barwell in his blind-
ness, has made no provision for preferential
voting. When the importance of ending the
first-past-the-post system was urged on the
Attorney-General, who piloted the redistribu-
tion proposals through the Leg. Assembly,
that functionary replied that controversial
questions had been kept out of the measure,
and contentious clauses sacrificed in its pro-
gress through Parliament, because the Gov-
ernment wanted to get it passed with “the
least possible delay”—this of a bill which
was promised in 1922, and that by an Admin-
istration whose Treasurer was president of
the Civic Reform League! Considering what
happened to Barwell, it is the very infatua-
tion of folly. And here it may be recalled
that, subsequent to the conviction of three
municipal employees for impersonation at
the 1921 poll, and while at least one of them
was serving his sentence, the Council, at the
instance of an alleged Civic Reformer, autho-
rised the Town Clerk to re-employ them. It
is a wonder he was not instructed to pay
them full wages during the period of incar-
ceration. But perhaps that wall come.
* * * #
The Town Clerk referred to was recently
retired with a gratuity of over £7OOO,
which works out at about £6 for .every week
of service, holidays (five weeks in the year)
included. Before he left, the recipient of this
bounty weighed in with a ponderous report
“dealing with the principal events and occur-
rences which arose principally during the
remarkable municipal year ended December
31, 1922” (the gentleman has Johnson’s
gift for “making little fishes talk like
whales”) ; and after his departure another
cartload of manuscript, his 1923 chronicle,
was deposited at the city office, but, for the
time being at least, this masterpiece has been
suppressed. The 1922 wilderness of words
covers 795 pages, lOin. x 6in., exclusive of
the index, and cost £BOO to print. In it
the student may nourish his young mind on
Avhat Maclaren. the cricketer, said at the
Town Hall; Avliat the manager of the
Maori footballers said; and what “the
visiting inter-State Railway amateur box-
ing and wrestling champions” were told
by the Lord Mayor. If stronger meat
is required there are the author's
controversy with Minahan, M.L.A., who had
held him responsible for an obnoxious
“spruiker” (four pages) ; his opinion
of an evening newspaper (3£ pages) ;
his digest of the North Shore Bridge Bill,
“the most iniquitous and infamous'exhibi-
tion of senile constructive statesmanship
ever submitted to Parliament” (two pages) ;
and the indignation that overwhelmed him
when “the Lord Mayor [McEliione]
allowed his resentment to over-ride his per-
spicacity, his discretion and his judgment,
and stigmatised an extract from my report
as ‘piffle.’ ” And for those who prefer their
facts unadorned even with Nesbitian flowers
of rhetoric, there is pabulum in plenty, and
some of it is striking enough. It is revealed
that municipal resumptions which were esti-
mated to cost £1,162,200 actually cost
£1,521,200, and then one job was in-
complete. The 1922 losses on vari-
ous enterprises run by the Council were
£5684 on the Queen Victoria building,
£l7l on the Strickland building, £326 on the
poultry market, £507 on the Pyrmont baths,
£929 on the Woolloomooloo baths, and £15,377
on the Town Hall. In the last Labor year
the staff received £46,060 in overtime pay.
During the same period the Electricity De-
partment, which used to be highly profitable,
earned .61 of 1 per cent, net on the capital
expended. Expenses of management were
£77,554 in Sydney as compared with £24,012
in the corresponding Melbourne undertaking,
which supplied a greater number of cus-
tomers ; distribution charges were £80,604 in
Sydney and £29,380 in Melbourne: and of
£464,699 paid in salaries and wages to the
Sydney employees £49,969 was for time not
worked. In a despairing address to the
aldermen whose mischievous interference has
produced these results, and others equally
flagrant, the general manager of the Eleo
tricity Department entreats them to “wake
up to the fact that the department must be
treated as a business, and should not be
throttled because it happens to be under the
Council’s control.” Records are also leaping
to light about the civic motor-cars, which
are said to have absorbed £11,201 in 1921
and £10,274 in 1922, and to have achieved
a running cost, in one instance at least, of
half a crown a mile.
* * * *
What municipal Sydney needs is not an-
other election between Tammany and Stodge
—an election from which there is nothing to
hope and a lot to fear —but the substitution
of a Board of Commissioners for the rabble
of aldermen until order is brought out of
chaos and a Greater Sydney made practicable.
There is good N. S. Wales precedent for the
suspension of an incapable City Council,
and the present infliction has earned the sen-
tence a dozen times over.
NEW WORLDS FOR OLD.
Dear Bulletin, —More things are happen-
ing, or promise to happen, in the British
Isles than it is easy to keep in mind, and
they are happening pretty fast. When one
considers the long calm, with a green scum
floating on top of it, which extended practi-
cally all the way from Waterloo time till 'the
days of the Crimea, and to some extent re-
sumed afterwards, it seems that motion was
almost forgotten then. Now there is little
else. It was once possible to get a large
sale in England for books which lived up to
titles such as “Occupations of a Retired
Life,” “Annals of a Quiet Neighborhood,” or
“Tales of a Lonely Parish,” but there is no
time for that literature any longer. One
question which inspires interest is the pros-
pect, if any, of the old style of Constitution
when things come out of the present melting-
pot stage. The House of Peers was always
considered an integral part of it, and the
element which made that institution look
dignified was the old landed aristocracy.
Now it has become possible for an aristocrat
who has no big side-lines to his business—
the farm-lands and ancestral-castle sort of
peer—to have many thousands a year and no
net income at all. The income-tax is a large
item ; there is a land tax; the tithe is called
for to keep up the fine old Established
Church; and the owner has to save up for
that levy on capital which happens at his
death. Often the property is burdened with
annuities to old family widows, and mort-
gages are not unknown; and even if the
castle is abandoned, it is a mark for the local
rate collector. The demand for old fortresses
as lunatic asylums or monkeries is now
almost nil, and the Yankee millionaire has
less ambition to settle in a country where
there is so much to pay and so little to
make. So stately homes boffin to be sold
as building material, and if their owners
drift gradually out of sight the Upper House
will tend to look so like Napoleon 111. s
peerage of Stock Exchange gamblers married
to painted women that it may possibly drift
away likewise. It has been surmised that
one fly in the ointment of Ramsay Mac-
shuffle’s postponed levy on capital was the
realisation that there wasn’t nearly so much
as was imagined to levy on except Govern-
ment securities, the seizure of which would
smell rather like repudiation and required
thinking over, and going businesses, which
might cease to go under Government manage-
ment. If present conditions have come to
stay, the next question is about the scheme,
to be carried out when and if Labor secures
a solid majority of its own, for turning the
British agricultural tenant into a small
agricultural proprietor, with the hope that
he will remain one, and not sell out to his
greedy neighbor who wants to go a-landlord-
ing. If purely agricultural land is to pay as
much as it does now to the national and
local revenue, the farmer-owner may be very
much the same as the farmer-tenant, even it
he gets his holding by pure confiscation. And
a Government with the passionate objection
that Macshuffle’s has to Customs revenue
can’t well let up on land taxation.
* * * *
The idea that revolution of the type which
involves a general shifting round of pover
and property may be coming in Britain is
one to be considered in anybody’s spare
moments. Certainly, no purely internal row
of the kind is on the British record up to
now; nor was it on Russia’s, for that matter,
until a very few years ago. Everything that
happens happens once for the first time.
Even the existence of A.n. 1024 is an inno-
vation ;, there was no such date m all pre-
vious history. Britain, at any rate, never
before owned a Government party whicli
talked so many revolutionary projects, or
which required such a limited . amount o
success at the ballot-box to put it in a po>
tion to talk a great deal more, and also to
put its views into practice. At no previous
time was there such a vast body of paup • •
who are apt to be a dissatisfied species, and
certainly never so many with votes; nor
was tliere so much taxation, nor the hear
ing example of the Irish I ree State, n •
lot of other interesting elements. Revcdu
tions come as often as not at unexpecte


times —not that the present time in England
looks more unexpected than might be ex-
pected. The latest Irish row began with the
Dublin uprising, just when the Bx-itish Gov-
ernment believed, with fatted complacency,
that its policy of shifting the long-hated
landlord was making Concord blossom like
the rose. The sympathetic Shaw Desmond,
in his book on this theme, asci-ibes the Dub-
lin failure to utter lack of popular sympathy,
and alleges that whatever maltreatment the
prisoners met with was at the hands of
Irish gaolers, not because they had a love of
England, but in panic lest the doings of
some misguided omadhauns might put back
the clock, and lose all that had been gained.
The enthusiasm was worked up afterwards,
or arose in no very accountable way after-
wai’ds. And the Bolsheviks of Russia secured
complete control just in time to upset the
men who had pulled down the sinful old
monarchy, and to scatter that freely elected
Parliament for which the nation had shed
its best blood for generations. Such instances
suggest that a revolution is an unpunctual
animal, and not easy to time.
* * * *
And the making of revolutions, which
doesn’t imply the turning of them to good
account afterwards, requires such a minimum
of really valuable intellect that an apparent
absence of leaders counts for little. A lawyer
in a small way of country practice has
proved equal to the needs of the case, also
;i barrister whose stutter prevented him prac-
tising. A parson who failed in even a very
humble line of curacy may take up the busi-
ness, and earn more at it than he could at
anything useful. In fact, what is a mere
four-pound-a-week intelligence for evei’y pro-
ductive or constructive occupation may be a
splendid intelligence to revolushe with. No
one believes that the avaricious Trotsky,
when he had no visible prospect of getting
back to Russia and resuming his old indus-
try, was by choice a hungry, feverish little
Jew of the Svengali type in a New York
tenement-house district. It was merely that,
though he loved palaces, and later proved an
inspired genius at “acquiring” them, lie
couldn’t make a palace.

Nor is the British weather likely to be any
the more calm and clear because of the
practical slamming of a door which has been
an outlet for the disaffected of Eui-ope (for
emigration implies disaffection) ever since
the real pressure of population began. When
the great armies were demobilised at the end
of the war the United States fell into panic
because all Europe was booking its passage
at once. So it passed the famous quota law,
whereby the coming in of people of any
nation in any one year was limited to 3 per
cent, of the number already in at the date
of the 1920 census. It was an insanely
clumsy device, because it automatically gave
preference to Germans, with Italians, Rus-
sians and Poles following in that order—
in other words, it let in most of the folk
who were wanted least. Still, the law
brought down immigration from 1,218,480
in 1914 (just before the war) and 805,228
in 1921 (when the movement resumed after
the war) to 309,556 in 1922. Uncle was
so pleased with the result that he later re-
duced the quota to 2 per cent, of the number
of foreign residents as shown by the census
of 1890, which is a great reduction in two
ways. Canadians and Newfoundlanders by
birth may come in freely, being regarded per-
haps as Uncle’s future subjects, but new
arrivals who try to use Canada as a highway
are barred out. The Mexican border is
watched as a dragon might watch a sleeping
infant. The tiny United Kingdom used to
send a very respectable-sized city across to
the republic in a year, both direct and via
Canada, but now all Western Eui-ope will
only export a town. Dozens of cheap steamers
are being debugged and deloused and disin-
fected and offered for sale, because their
impecunious human cargoes will take the
cheap western route no more. No easily
accessible new outlets are opening: in fact.
Brazil and Argentina both tend to imitate
their neighbor. So Europe, and especially
such crowded sections as England, are pro-
mised a unique chance to fill up, and when a
vessel fills too much it sometimes bursts,
especially if much of the contents don’t want
to be there.—Yours, etc.,

PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Trickle that May Become a Flood.
It lias been remarked in several quarters
that foreign immigrants with little money
and less English—in some eases, with neither
—are arriving in unusual numbers. Men-
tion was made in the 'N. S. Wales Assembly
the other day of a party of Greeks who had
found their way to Broken Hill, and, failing
to get work, invited the authorities to feed
and house them. It is morosely insinuated
that the. Fuller Government is to blame
for their advent, though how the Fuller
Government could profit by burdening itself
with penniless Levantines who have no
votes and can't even be employed in the
LaborjSocialist fish-shops (now mouldering
in the grave of insolvency, albeit the deficit
is marching on) is no clearer than mud. A
more probable theory is that the unwelcome
strangers were attracted by a report that
Broken Hill was a stronghold of Marxian
internationalism, where the workers would
gladly share what they had with their
brothers from Europe, the greasier the better.
Gunn, the South Aus. Premier, has also
been heard complaining that swarthy repre-
sentatives of the Alpine and Mediterranean
races are getting off the boat at Port Adel-
aide and swarming to Port Pirie; and his
enemies retort that this is a judgment on
him for his churlish cancellation of the
Harwell boy-immigration scheme —a scheme
which, individual failures notwithstanding,
was to some extent ameliorating the saddest
feature of Britain’s post-war slump and
doing no harm to South Australia. Some
of the newcomers are Finns, who are indus-
trious, self-reliant and assimilable, and there-
fore welcome. Others are Italians. For
the unskilled laborer from South Italy Aus-
tralia has no yearning: to mention only one
reason, it has too many unskilled laborers
already. But the thrifty Italian peasant
has to be considered in another light. For
North Australian agricultural conditions lie
is about as good an immigrant as can be
got. It would be ungrateful not to recognise
the valuable work he has done in the cane-
sugar country, and if more of liis class
arrive, bringing their own money, with the
intention of growing cotton, rice, tea, coffee
and similar crops in North Queensland, the
Northern Territory and Northern West-
ralia, no obstacles should be put in their
way. Incidentally, Italy is one of Aus-
tralia’s very good customers, and it will
profit this country to realise that the nation
which rallied so splendidly after the disaster
of Gaporetto, and again when it seemed that
nothing could save it from the chaos of Bol-
shevism, is destined to play a great part in
the world’s affairs. There is really no mys-
tery about the increase in foreign immigra-
tion. It is manifestly a consequence of the
U.S.A.’s abandonment of the melting-pot tra-
dition. In 1912-13 1,197,892 European immi-
grants were admitted to the Republic
(283,728 were from Italy, 278,152 from Aus-
tria-Hungary and 255,660 from Russia) ; and
in 1913-14 1,218,480 arrived. In future the
number will be 150,000 or thereabouts,
although there are more people anxious to
leave Europe than ever before. When the
3 per cent, law, as recently amended at Wash-
ington, is in full operation, Australia will
become increasingly attractive to over-
crowded Europe, and the politicians will
have to decide what they are going to do
about it. In the meantime the Government
might cause it to be known in Mediterranean
and Baltic ports that paupers from those
parts are liable to be examined in Erse or
Cornish, and, if proved ignorant of these
tongues, to be sent back at the shipping com-
pany’s expense.

Deeming’s Hard Luck.
How many convicted murderers are roam-
ing Queensland? It is almost past belief
that a man, sentenced there to' death for
what Justice Macnaughton described as
“about as cold-blooded a murder as has ever
been committed,” should be given his free-
dom after serving seven years. Mr. Stop-
ford, Home Secretary, has explained the
man’s release. Justice Real, in a report of
the case, stated as follows; “I think the evi-
dence of the prisoner’s guilt is clear, but I
agree with the jury’s recommendation to
mercy. During the course of the case I
noticed not only his youth [about 20 years],
but that he seemed not to appreciate the
true nature of the offence, and to lack a
true sense of the gravity of his position.”
The prisoner, in Mr. Stopford’s words, “was
sentenced to death in 1916, and this was
commuted at the instance of the Executive
Council to imprisonment for 15 years. From
that 15 years the prisoner received the ordi-
nary remission under the prison regulations
of three years nine months; the Peace remis-
sion of one-fiftli of his sentence, a remission
given to all prisoners which amounted to
three years ; the Christmas remission of 1921,
amounting to one year; and a special remis-
sion for good work performed, six weeks.”
Now the same prisoner, Michael Law-
rence, who has by this time reached 28
years of age, has been found guilty, in Bris-
bane, of stealing from the person with vio-
lence, and has been sentenced to three years’
imprisonment with hard labor. Another case
is that of Samuel James Hannah. He was
sentenced in Brisbane in 1905 for wilful
murder, and the sentence was commuted to
imprisonment for life. In 1919, 14 years
later, he was again carrying on the good
work of the reformed criminal. In that year,
in Brisbane, he got two years for stealing
from the person with violence (sand-bag-
ging). He was next heard of in N. S. Wales
—three years at Grafton —for stealing from
the person. For a similar offence he got
three months in Brisbane in 1924. Being
now a habitual criminal, his sentences, it
will be observed, were getting lighter. But
even they have not had the desired effect, for
in May he turned up at Mitchell, where he
was convicted of “stealing from the person.”
Presumably in view of his past bad conduct,
he was immediately set free on paying a fine
of £lO. Not unnaturally, Hannah seems at
this stage to have realised that the authori-
ties expected him to do his worst. He did
what he could on short notice, and in July
a jury at Roma found him guilty of at-
tempted murder. Had his revolver not
misfired at the first pull he might
have stood his trial for his second
murder. At it xvas, the next time
he pulled the trigger the bullet went through
the arresting constable’s left arm, which
was raised across his chest, penetrating his
coat near the heart. For this he received
his second life sentence, and though nearly
a month has passed, so far as this paper
knows he is still in custody. Be it noted
that these two malefactors were released, not
because they had reformed, but on account
of “regulation” remissions, Christmas remis-
sions, etc. The pernicious system concerns
not only the people of Queensland, who pro-
bably deserve all they get because they pro-
vide themselves with the sort of Administra-
tion which gives such results, but also those
of all Australia; for once set at liberty there
is nothing to prevent the abnormalities from
entering the other States.

Preiulergast’s Hypothetical Homes.
The Prendergast Government of Victoria
was out before the dew was off the grass with
big schemes which should keep its memory
alive after it is dead. One is its housing
scheme, based, of course, on the wobbly old
idea of building a house dear and selling fit
cheap at a profit. There are lots of such
inspirations on the market, here and in the
Cold Country, but Queensland has a policy
for running up mathematical mansions on
paper by single and double entry, and this is
said to have taken Prendergast’s fancy. In
his excitement he has appointed a Minister
of Housing. As sketched in the press the
matter is quite simple. The State is to dash
up the shack, giving the usual complete or in-
complete satisfaction in the process, and
after the buyer has paid £25 down and about
18s. 7d. a week, or a few coppers over £4B
per annum, for 20 years, he is to enter into
full possession, just as .Jacob got the deeds
of his second wife after 14 years’ payment
on the lay-by system. Of course there arc
flaws in the prospective Prendergast pal-
ace, but who can avoid flaws? The house
may cost £BOO. It isn't much for a stone
or brick day-labor, Labor-Government-stroke
house in Melbourne, with enough land
attached for the cat to breathe in, and the
State taken down in the purchase of the land.
If the Government borrows the money at 54
per cent, the interest will absorb £44 a year,
and leave the other £4 of the odfcupier’s con-
tribution (in all £BO, spread over 20 years)
to pay for the £BOO house. Should the in-
terest on the Government loan be 6 per
cent, it will absorb the whole 18s. 7d. paid
by the buyer; and after 20 or any other
number of years he will have to be presented
with the house—if it still is a house. The
occupier, being an owner or buyer instead of
a tenant, must pay for rates and repairs. If
the record of the war-service homes, also
put together by Government stroke, is any
criterion, repairs will be heavy, including new
top and sides. The plain landlord pays for
rates and repairs, but the vendor doesn’t
pay after he has vended, and .somebody must
pay. Many tenants will probably save money
by neglecting repairs, and when the home
ceases to be worth repairing they will flit.
They are liable to be like the Queenslander
who got a prickly-pear perpetual lease, of
which the official record says “the rent for
the first 15 years is a peppercorn (if de-
manded).” He was to pay by clearing away
the cactus, but he found it more profitable
to use the uninfected part of the lease for
grazing, and when it was all infected, and
all cactus, lie left. The cactus was his repair
bill, and it wasn’t worth while to pay it. In
any, case the regulation housing project only
attempts to serve the class which is pretty
well served by Private Enterprise already—
tinl instalment folk, who have time-payment
homes and time-payment furniture, and pos-
sibly a time-payment runabout, and who may
even dress in lay-by clothes. It does nothing
for the very large rent-paying section which
can’t tie itself down for 20 years or 20
months. If Government homes were built by
piecework, in which case twice as many bricks
might be laid per man per day, all these
schemes 1 might have a better show. As it is,
there is always an advantage in selling on
20 years’ terms, for it isn’t necessary to go
into full details about the losses and compli-
cations for 194 years—unless, of course, a
new Government is mean and makes ex-
posures.

A Clout for the Home Consumer.
Paterson, M.H.R. for Gippsland, a light
of the Vic. Country party, has elaborated
a scheme for the “stabilisation” of the butter
industry. Briefly it amounts to a forced
levy of 3d. on every pound of butter sold to
the local consumer. It is an amazing instance
of the disregard for and even dislike of the
home market, the one right at his elbow,
which animates the political cocky. The
ordinary business man for innumerable rea-
sons values the market at his door, and
treats it with at least consideration, not to
say courtesy; but the cocky of a certain de-
luded type despises this trade. Because Lon-
don parity is necessarily higher than the local
price (owing to such considerations as
freight, insurance, handling, distribution and
publicity) he considers that the local con-
sumer, his best customer, should be fined
3d. per lb. because he doesn’t live ten thou-
sand miles away. His Gippsland represen-
tative’s scheme, so far as butter is concerned,
is that there should be an excise duty of Id.
on every pound manufactured, and that the
amount so realised should be returned to the
industry in the form of a bounty on exported
butter. As Paterson himself points out, the
effect of this would be to raise the price of
local butter by at least 3d. per lb., because
only one-third of Australia’s butter-produc-
tion is exported. It would be interesting to
hear how lie could reconcile a tax of this
nature with the Cocky party’s objection to
the protecting of Australian industries on
the ground that there must be no interfer-
ence with the natural laws of supply and
demand. In any case, and whether any ex-
planation is offered or not, in view of the
peculiar complexion of Federal politics which
gives the Cocky party a power quite out of
proportion to its strength in the constitu-
encies, the proposal must be carefully watched
and early steps taken to nip it in the bud.

Bourbonism in Australia.
Dear Bulletin,- —This eulogy of the House
of Commons, clipped from a London paper,
has a bearing on a matter which is continu-
ally under discussion Jiere :
Isn’t it all in glorious contrast to those Elysian
Fields of the House of Lords, where there is neither
passion nor applause, no panic nor movement? Isn’t
it life in microcosm; as changeable, as peaceful and
tumultuous as the sea?
An attitude of suavity and pacifism is pecu-
liar to every Upper House, from the British
Lords and the French Senate to the humblest
Legislative Council in Australia. Why? Be-
cause most of the members are there not
to fight, but: to obstruct. They are the
“haves,” whose chief mission in life is to
resist the predatory designs of the less for-
tunate. Australia is one of international-
ism’s Second Chambers. It has its exact
analogue in the legislative sphere. The
House of Lords is quite capable of direct
action when an extremely distasteful mea-
sure comes up to it from the popular Cham-
ber : it declares war by definitely rejecting
the bill. The French Senate hardly ever
takes such a chance. If it dislikes a pro-
posal it does nothing, and so the proposal
is eventually blanketed and lost. This is
the Australian method in regard to defence,
loan orgies, the hospital problem, V.D. and
practically all issues that are big enough
to be awkward. To every portentous de-
velopment in the struggling, hungry world
outside, and particularly to those overseas
situations which are the outcome of over-
crowding and under-feeding, this continent
presents a countenance of bland, slightly
incredulous amiability. It is the attitude
always adopted by Upper Houses, containing
a large admixture of the element known to
Labor propagandists as Fat, towards the
importunities of the poor. The odd thing is
that the most selfishly monopolistic are those
who denounce similar tendencies in members
of the capitalist class. Our workers object
to the introduction of colored labor, not
from a passion for race purity (many of
them regard this doctrine as a superstition
disseminated with the object of keeping the
workers of the world apart), but because
coolie workers threaten coolie wage-stand-
ards. To appreciate this, it is only neces-
sary to read or listen to the hostile remarks
of proletariat leaders about Queensland's
Northern Italians, who are every bit as
white as ourselves, and even about the so-
called “Pommy,” wherever the latter is sus-
pected of the offence of wage-cutting. Yet,
though our militant industrialists are daily
giving workers overseas, and especially
Asiatic ones, the gravest grounds for indig-
nation, the idea that these hungry and humi-
liated people will ever translate anger into
action is rejected with scorn. A very simi-
lar fallacy was clung to, to the last, by
the French Chamber of Peers of the Restora-
tion and July Monarchy—and that is oile
of the reasons why it is no more. There
are only two logical attitudes where an indi-
vidual has something that he suspects stran-
gers of wanting. Ope is to admit that the
article is not worth keeping, and leave it on
the front verandah, day and night, in viete
of the populace. The other is to assess its
value at a reasonable figure, and provide it
with a proportionate amount of custody.
Upper Houses rarely commit themselves to
either of these policies nowadays. Members
are content to drift, and hold their jobs,
which is one of the reasons why the aboli-
tion of these institutions is a popular cry in
most countries. Australia is drifting—and
in no respect more noticeably than defence—
and the infatuated Bourbons of the Labor
movement are chiefly to blame. In order to
save present trouble and expense they are
seeking to persuade themselves and the world
that pearls of great price can be retained
permanently by speaking kindly of burglars.

Playing at Soldiers.
“Windsor” after a “parade”:—
In an article headed “Servants of the Public” an
offensive sub-leader writer said I was “thoughtless,”
He mightn’t have mentioned me in particular; to
be exact, he referred, inter alia, to “the thoughtless
young men who prefer football or cricket to drill.”
I plead guilty of being one of that class, but strongly
deny that I am thoughtless. In fact, the more
thoughtful one is in regard to this matter, the' more
convinced he becomes that the present drill is a
ridiculous and expensive farce. After foot-slogging in
tile senior cadets for four years, and having now
commenced my first year of training in the Citizen
Forces, I know that not 10 out of every 50 cadets
take the slightest interest in the drill, or derive any
benefit from it, while one and all entertain the
most bloodthirsty feelings towards the author of the
system.
The average trainee, on completing his preliminary
four years’ senior cadet drill, has learned, provided
his instructor was extraordinarily thorough, how to
properly “form fours.” Aware of the ludicrous figure
he cuts, he is greatly averse to appearing in public
in the illfitting uniform with which he is supplied.
The drill he does is neither interesting nor educative.
His officers are, in the main, uninspiring and lacking
in capability for their job; the old ones are slow and
stodgy, the younger ones irritatingly tactless, over-
bearing and puffed up. It is not surprising, therefore,
that the trainee is heartily fed-up with the whole
thing by the time he enters the Citizen Forces, and
any interest lie might have taken in the training has
evaporated. Of course, it can’t be denied that even
if the drill was made interesting, as it could be, there
would be the inevitable section that would moan at
having to surrender its Saturday afternoons and
Tuesday nights; but when there is a dreary repeti-
tion of squad-drill, rifle-cleaning and monotonous
flag-signalling, parade after parade, and important
football matches are missed, it is only natural that
99 per cent, of the cadets attend their parades in
a spirit of passive resistance, unwilling to learn
and delighted when the parade is over. (I write
wich some bitterness, having missed a semi-final last
year, and being compelled to put off several agree-
able Tuesday-night appointments this year, owing
to compulsory parades.)
I haven’t been through one of the eight-day con-
tinuous-training camps yet, but I believe they are
really of some value, probably because the work is
almost of necessity practical and interesting. As they
stand at present, however, the Saturday-afterhoon and
Tuesday-evening drills are a farcical waste of time
and money. Most of the routine drill should be
dispensed with, and the cadet given practical instruc-
tion by competent officers; get him to handle every
kind of weapon himself, and let officers who know
what they are talking about lecture him on the
interesting phases of modern warfare —the “form-
fours” type of drill doesn’t matter. Further, all
aspirants to commissioned rank should be required to
show that they can handle a squad so as to get it
interested—the majority of the young officers seem
bent on reducing trainees to a state of sullen boredom.
The drill is so universally hated that there would
be a great falling-off in the attendance once the
voluntary system was inaugurated ; but it is surely
preferable to have, say, only one-quarter of the present
force in training provided that number attends of its
own accord and gets some benefit from the drill, than
for four times that number of uninterested trainees to
attend the parades only because they’ve got to.

A Subsidy for the Loafer.
Queensland, the premier State of Australia
in fertility, in natural resources, in area
of well-watered country, drifts continually
to leeward in her finances. Two delusions
obsess those who rule its rulers: one that the
prosperity of the State can only be main-
tained by stemming back immigration that
would flow in did it receive encouragement:
the other that the inclination of any worker
to produce to the top of his ability is a
thing to be sternly discouraged. In the
year 1914-15 (the last of the old Liberal
regime), when the man who wilfully did
not produce was left to his own devices, the
expenditure on relief amounted to only
£5870. In 1921-22 the moneys spent in the
same direction amounted to £177.019. As
these figures constituted a grave public scan-
dal, an ingenious way out of the difficulty
was devised by putting through Parliament
an. Unemployment Sustenance Bill. Under
this measure relief is handed out just the
same, but is labelled in a different fashion, so
that the total may be increased without so
much fuss being made about it. This is how
things work out now:—
Expenditure in Relief.
1921- .. .. £177,019
1922- .. .. 76,413
1923- .. .. 189.978*
♦lncluding unemployment sustenance, £149,109.
In order to put beyond doubt that Queens-
land's policy is not to. be varied in this
matter, it is announced that the anticipated
public expenditure on relief for the forth-
coming financial year will be £219,468 —in-
cluding. of course, the unemployment susten-
ance allowance. So that in this business of
demoralising the country by feeding the able-
bodied on doles, and consequently checking
production by encouraging laziness, Banfina-
land proposes to actually do more than ever.

Sustenance” does not alter the gravity of
the position one iota. It can be safely said
that 90 per cent, of the £219,000 will be
purely a subsidy for loafing. This would be
bad enough if it meant only that the country
was offering a premium for non-production

worse feature even than that; for the pay-

Cold Days in England.
A gkoan from Freetrade England is to the
effect that the iron, steel and coal industries,
which went down to the bottom of the
trough of depression in 1921 and then rose
a little, have discovered a new trough. It
must be deeper than its predecessor, for the
report has it that the position is the worst
for 40 years. What the previous worst was
like goes neatly into two columns of figures:
. 1913. 1921.
Blast furnaces working . . 338 95
Pig-iron made (tons) .'. 10,260,000 2,616,000
Pig-iron exported (tons) . . 1,128,000 103,000
Coal and Coke used (tons).. 21,244,000 3,727,000
Coal and Coke exported (tons) 76,688,000 26,247,000
To achieve a deeper slump than that is
something of an achievement, but apparently
it nas been done. Closure is the order of
the daj r . A special peg on which to hang the
tale of gloom is furnished by the case of
Bolckow, Vaughan and Co., a concern in its
83rd year, which works on such a massive
scale that it has produced as much as 800,000
tons of pig-iron and used 2,500,000 tons of
coal per annum. Its ordinary shares (nearly
two millions of them) are paid up to 12s.
and were lately selling at Is. 6d. The con-
cern decided to call up the remaining Bs.
per share in order to buy off the wolf at the
door, and that has been a final blow. Now
shares are offering for nothing with a present
of 2s. each thrown in, provided the presentee
takes over the call liability and is able to
persuade the directors that the amount can
be successfully extorted from him. In the
days of the Australian slump one bank fell
into the same negative condition, yet it re-
covered and attained to great prosperity
again. But a bank in a Protectionist coun-
try and a gigantic industrial show struggling
under Freetrade are not exactly the same
proposition. Judging from the figures the
ordinary shareholders of Bolckow, Vaughan
and Co. regard the future of the industry
as more like a past than anything else.
Matters having been fixed up with the Hun a
great Hun loan of £40,000,000 is in process
of arrangement, and it is reckoned that with
this new capital to put in the business, Fritz
will compete even more briskly than here-
tofore. The daily dirge in England is about
the necessity for finding new markets, but
unfortunately foreigners are chary about giv-
ing away markets in these sordid days. It
is apt to be a matter of selling them, one
country offering to lower its protective duty
on the other’s exports, in return for a con-
cession of the same sort of its own exports,
both being desperately anxious not to lower
away too rapidly lest the rope gives out.
But that eccentricity, a Freetrade nation,
has nothing to bargain with abroad. Having
given away its goods, it can’t sell them
also. This was the point which Baldwin
saw, but unluckily for him and for Britain
an insufficient number of people saw it
along with him. He further realised, what
the Yankee did long ago, that the local mar-
ket is the one best worth preserving. If a
nation can be sufficient unto itself it doesn’t
make the silly mistake of buying more from
itself than it sells to itself, so that it has
to borrow from itself to pay itself, or fall
into other mouldy complications of the sort.

The Second Cruiser.
After studying Monash’s report on the cost
of building the second of the two 10,000-ton
cruisers to be added to the R.A.N., the Gov-
ernment has postponed its decision as to
Australian or British construction until ten-
ders have been furnished. It justifies this
cautious procedure by pointing out that the
estimates submitted were prepared without
reference to plans and specifications of the
latest type of 10,000-ton cruiser, which are
not yet available in Australia, whereas ten-
ders will be based on something more sub-
stantial than guesswork. The Australian
Naval Board thinks that the cruiser could
be built for £3,700,000. The Shipping Board
considers that £3,335,000 would be sufficient,
and the A.I.F. commander is inclined to
agree with it. He declares, however, that
a cruiser could be constructed in Britain
and delivered in Australia for £1,000,000
less than it would cost at Cockatoo Dock,
and suggests that it would be better to spend
the. million on “reproductive works from
which the whole of the people could perma-
nently benefit” than to devote it to “the
immediate but very temporary benefit of a
negligible percentage of the population.”
Australia will always have a respect for
Monash’s opinion on any matter of de-
fence, but the line of argument quoted does
not exhibit him at his best. He takes it
for granted that the million (which itself is
taken for granted, there being no exact in-
formation from Britain) would be “perma-
nently withdrawn from the whole popula-
tion of the Commonwealth.” But portion
of it would obviously return to the Treasury
in the form of taxes. Another portion would
nourish key industries which have not had a
particularly exhilarating time since 1919.
And something should surely be allowed for
skill developed in the process of building,
which skill would be available for future
naval programmes and for the service of the
nation in the desperate emergency of war.
Then there is the moral effect that local
construction would have on a people which
has got into the careless habit of sending
abroad for goods that can be made in Aus-
tralia, _ with the result, among others, that
home industries languish and imports dan-
gerously exceed exports. Other factors to
be taken into account, although Monash
doesn’t allude to them, are that the Anglo-
Japanese alliance is a thing of the past,
and that the Commonwealth would have to
reckon on being isolated, for several weeks
at least, from the British Navy (consider-
ably weakened as a result of the Washington
Agreement) if war broke out in the Pacific.
It might even be separated by 12,000 miles
of heaving ocean from two 10,000-ton
cruisers built on cheap Foreign-trade prin-
ciples. It is too late in the day to raise the
pitiful cry that Australia can’t afford to
build warships in Australia. The position is
that it can’t afford not to build warships in
Australia.

Black Brother and the Mission.
“Bouragi” writes from much experience:—
Captain Pitt Rivers, in the paper on problems of
depopulation in the Western Pacific which he read
STUNTING HIS GROWTH.
“The saddest thing I have heard in this case is to be told by men in the witness box that they have
been at the same class of work for 20 or 25 years because they have not been given a chance to get
above it. Your union objects to piecework and bonus rates, but by so objecting you are keeping your
members from getting on in the world. It is only by bonuses and piecework that engineers are rising
in America and elsewhere.” — Justice Powers, of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, to the Amalga-
mated Engineering Union.
JONATHAN: “ Guess I’d never have grown up, bo, if they’d fed me that pap."
at the recent Australasian Science Congress in Adel-
aide, put his finger on a vital point and one which
the missionary has always refused to recognise. This
is that the civilisation or culture of a backward
people is conditional on its ability to develop artistic,
scientific or technical accomplishments and skill.
Without this capacity to acquire, all else is futile,
according to Pitt Rivehs ; and as he does not think
that in this case the capacity is there, he considers
“missionary action cannot save these doomed races.”
Of course, the capacity to imbibe new teachings
is, as Pitt Rivers says, the beginning and end of it
all. The real beliefs of a native Christian, plastered
orer the immutable heathen foundation, no one can
tell, the missionary least of all. The downright
practical reasoning of a native lady convert will lead
her to raise money for a Bible, or a subscription to
a new cnurch, in the most unrighteous manner,
though it is impossible to persuade her or her men
folk that she has been doing anything reprehensible.
It is notorious the world over that native converts
lose many of the primitive virtues without acquiring
anything in their place. The first thing the average
missionary imposes on his converts is the necessity
for the abolition, or at least concealment, of practices
and customs hitherto considered a matter of course.
This principle is soon extended, and the truthful
and honest savage slips gradually into lying and
thieving, or to demanding money for services which
he once rendered in all good fellowship.
The result is that the native convert is an inhabi-
tant of No Man’s Land. Outside the missions white
men distrust him. In his own village his heathen
acquaintances, who often come in contact with his
facility in extortion, like him even less. And this
is true not only of Pacific races, but wherever the
mission form of Christianity is thrust upon people
who are not able to digest even the little of it
they have been able to swallow. Yet it is to this
type of native that the missionary bodies of Papua
desire to give a vote in the election of the local
Legislative Council. Every year they return to the
attack on the Federal Government, and some day, if
their luck is in, they may get what they want.

Fire-Brigade Superintendent Trousselot,
who, during the last decade, and especially
since his war service ended, has brought
Hobart’s fire-fighting system and appliances
up to the top-notch of efficiency, and who
periodically repeats his warning yell against
the local shingle-roof mania, recently inaug-
urated a vigorous “clean up and paint up
and keep it up” campaign. He received
much newspaper support and publicity, and
a fair measure of co-operation from many
public and private bodies. But the Trades
Council, despite the fact that hundreds of
unemployed are at present on its books, flatly
declined to have anything to do with the
campaign. It sounds rather small and one-
eyed; but it is suggested, by way of extenua-
tion, that it was the only way the Trades
Council could show that it remembers with
bitterness the fact that some years ago
Trousselot successfully out-manoeuvred an
ill-advised strike of Fire Brigade employees.
Perhaps it was necessary to the maintenance
of the self-respect of a properly brought up
Trades Council to administer a snub to a
“strike-breaker”; but when it might mean
wet-blanketing a promising spasm of volun-
tar r spring-cleaning calculated to find jobs
for unemployed artisans and other “com-
rades,” it looks like a rotten bit of diplo-
macy, as well as poor citizenship.
«
“Cartot” : The movement designed to ameli-
orate the lot of women in the country might
include in its scope the nurses employed in
rural hospitals. Lacking active representa-
tion in quarters where it would count, their
position is infinitely worse than that of their
sisters in metropolitan institutions. Poorly
paid and often ill-fed. the majority work long
hours, and live under the most trying condi-
tions. Their duties, especially in the smaller
hospitals, are only too frequently of a sort
that no woman would be expected to perform
elsewhere. And despite the universal iiir
creases in wages on all sides, the salaries
paid to country hospital nurses are practi-
cally the same as they were 10 years ago.
Yet there is no class of workers to whom
the community is under a deeper debt than
this one.
♦
“Heredot” : It is wrong to assume that
there is a general readiness in the police
force to undertake the unpleasant and mean
work involved in attempts to obtain convic-
tions for sly-grog selling and the like by
trickery and false representation. In both
the Victorian and the N. S. Wales forces
there are many men who have steadfastly
refused this sort of work, even at the risk
of losing their jobs or being disrated for
insubordination. So pronounced is this feel-
ing amongst the majority that the unsavory
duty is generally reserved for the few who find
themselves able to approach it without com-
punction. Their reward is that they come
constantly under the notice of their superiors,
and are likely to obtain quicker promotion
thereby; many are raised to the plain-clothes
and detective branches after a few years’
service, while men more squeamish are still
walking suburban beats, or doing duty in
some out-back country district. Of late
years it has been an open secret that the
quickest way to the favor of headquarters
is to be willing to undertake dirty work. To
some extent this has been responsible for
the falling-off in fhe numbers of recruits to
the police of Melbourne and Sydney. There
are many young fnen who are anxious to join
the force, but who draw the line at duty
which can only earn them public obloquy.

“X2X”: Surgical sterilisation, periodically
advocated by well-meaning people for sexual
perverts, has not proved a success in those
places, mostly in America, where it has been
tried. Many medical authorities view it as
utterly useless when resorted to after a cer-
tain age, and liable to leave the subject
operated on just as active sexually as before.
Laymen who favor it base their advocacy
mainly on the results of such operations in
the case of animals. Actually there is no
similitude. With cattle and horses sterilisa-
tion is successful simply because it is carried
out when the calf and the foal are only a
few months old, the cerebral sexual centres
never developing in them for the reason that
their growth is controlled —probably by hor-
mones or other similar bodies —from the
parts that have been surgically removed. It
is quite different with the human being, when
the operation is delayed until late youth or
middle age, by which time the cerebral centres
are as fully developed as they are ever likely
to be. Since they are not affected, except
indirectly and secondarily, they are often
capable of supplying emotions and impulses
that are as powerful and as uncontrollable
as before. It is worth noting that every
American State which has ever tried surgi-
cal sterilisation has abandoned it. The only
efficient method of dealing with those unfit
persons consists of segregation, either for
life or for a certain period. And that in-
volves a careful examination of school child-
ren, in order that individuals who are super-
normal sexually may be detected by psycholo-
gical tests as early as possible.

“H.P.”: Though it may not be all it should
be, the proposal of the Sydney University
Senate to send lecturers into the country
may be a very good beginning. Here in
Victoria we have a University Extension
Board, which conducts classes in country
centres; a class here in our village (Cole-
raine) has been in existence for over a year,
and has finished a course on Industrial
History. There is good reason to believe
that the educative effects will spread far
beyond the comparatively small number of
students who avail themselves of the course.
Now we are “doing” International Politics,
commencing with Japan. In a couple of
evenings we have learnt more of Japan and
her possible relations with Australia than
most of us had ever thought of before. What
more important subject could the youth of
Australia spend a spare hour or two a week
considering? The Melbourne University
Extension Board is under the chairmanship
of Professor Alex. Gunn. Our class-tutor
is Stephen H. Roberts, M.A., author of
the “History of Australian Land Settlement,
17S8-1920,” just out, and lecturer in British
History at the University. Thomas Burt
said years ago that he believed in a sys-
tem of education which would enable any
smart child to go “bang up to the univer-
sity.” In Victoria we have advanced be-
yond that; the University comes bang up
to us in the furthest-out parts. We have
the best brains of the University staff avail-
able literally at our own firesides. The
classes are, of course, conducted by corres-
pondence. A “lecture” is supplied each
week; it is read by a member of the class,
and discussed, along with perhaps a paper
written by one of ourselves.

POLITICAL
POINTS
While the League of Nations Assembly
was palavering at Geneva last week Ramsay
Macdonald produced a disarmament scheme
out of his hat. Details are veiled in obscu-
rity, but the speech was received with deaf-
ening applause by the representatives of
countries whose affairs Clumsy has been
settling at the expense of his native Britain.
In that respect he has been an uncommon
success. Red Russia has been “recognised,”
and in consideration of a valueless promise
to pay portion of its debt to Britain is to
receive—if Macdonald can manage it —a huge
British loan. Germany is also to get a
massive advance from London, and, with
au exquisite humor greatly appreciated on
the Continent, it has been arranged to use
portion of the money to finance deliveries
of reparations coal and manufactured goods
to France, Italy and Belgium, which coun-
tries will curtail their British orders accord-
ingly. Meantime the British unemployed,
for whom work was to be found on good old
Freetrade principles, are increasing at a
brisker rate than ever.
For the discouragement of the person who
wants a handle to his name the S. Aus. Labor
Government has come to light with a measure
which is at least comprehensive:—
It shall not be lawful for the Governor or any
Minister of the Crown to recommend to his Majesty
the King, or to the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
or any member of his Majesty’s Government, the
grant or bestowal of any dignity or title of honor
to or on any person, unless a resolution has first
been passed by both Houses of Parliament approving
of the recommendation of such person to receive such
dignity or title.
It looks formidable enough to quench the
ardor of even a pony-racecourse proprietor or
picture-showman. However, the aspiring
toad hopes that the Leg. Council will deal
with the bill as it is expected to deal with
the Government's proposals for mending the
Chamber preparatory to ending it. And if
the Council fails him he will still be able to
carry his aspirations to the Commonwealth
Government.
Probably there is no explanation of the
wonderful beer-fight at the Sydney artists’
hall save that bad characters leaked in. The
Melbourne riot of a few months ago was a
similar prompt seizure of opportunity. A
disquieting thing is that bad characters should
be on hand so promptly and in such quan-
tities right alongside the opportunity. It
makes one think that the garment of civilisa-
tion hangs on by a very precarious button,
and comes off very easily. Supposing the
land was wholly unarmed and given over to
pacifism, it is possible, of course, that the
rioters of Melbourne and the basement row-
dies of Sydney might reform themselves, and
become in time the pride and joy of the com-
munity. On the other hand they might
decide to remain as they were, or even to
become worse, and proceed to enlist rein-
forcements. In such a case, what is to pre-
vent the relapse into barbarism beginning
on Monday night being fairly complete by
Wednesday?
Queensland Education Minister Brennan
has decided to follow the good example set by
the Victorian Lemmon and expunge refer-
ences to war from his school-books. But this
is only half-baked censorship, after all. Why
not do the thing properly and forbid refer-
ence to it in the newspapers? And then, of
course, since the arrival of a new Govern-
ment would overturn all the good work, the
proner course will be to forbid reference to
any other Government in the past, so that
the children may grow up believing that no
other Government is possible. The new way
of spelling the thing Brennan thinks he
stands for is Demostriclicy.
Arkins, a Sydney M.L.A., thinks that
orgies like the Artists’ Ball would cease if
pubs were closed from morn till dewy eve
and back again. Last year in Unctuous
Sham’s country, where Prohibition rages
right round the clock, 50,000 physicians pre-
scribed 1,400,614 gallons of whisky, wine,
brandy, gin and rum to 11,268,469 invalids
suffering from acute or chronic thii-st; so
it looks as if Macquarie-street will have to
be shut up as well.
THE STUDENT.
“Minister for Customs Pratten is making a close and laborious study of the incidence of the Tariff,
in view of the adjustments that are to be made by Parliament in the short session at the end of the
year.”
In Queensland, as in N. S. Wales, a bitter
quarrel is raging between the A.L.P. execu-
tive and district branches. In an expansive
moment the executive declared the Bulimba
organisation “automatically out of the move-
ment,” or something of the sort, but a special
conference of delegates from nearly 30 unions
and most of the metropolitan branches is
about to sit in defiance of the executive, and
Bulimba’s re-instatement will assuredly be
demanded. Also, the question of running
industrial candidates against Labor Parlia-
mentarians at the next election will probably
be discussed. The Brisbane executive is de-
voted to the Government, and hitherto the
A.W.U. has been loyalty itself. But with the
closing-down of railway-construction jobs the
big union is looking less unfavorably on the
wild men of the movement, who rage unceas-
ingly about the London loan-settlement, the
refusal to raise wages and shorten hours,
Theodore’s anxiety to leave the tempest-
tossed ship, Huxliam’s retreat to the Agency-
General, the increased cost of that excres-
cence—at least that is what Fihelly calls it
—and other agreeable features of Queensland
Labor politics.
Tasmania li&s had no better luck with its
State steamers than Westralia or the Com-
monwealth. Discovering that they had been
run at a loss of £40,000 in 1922-23, the
Labor Government made a deal with the
Patrick Steamship Co. by which it was to
be relieved of the horribly expensive Mel-
bourne and the nearly as costly Poolta on a
six months’ charter. At the end of that
period the vessels were to change hands. Now
the Patrick Co. has thrown up the sponge,
and Guy, whose young shoulders have to
carry the burden, is trying to induce the
cockies to go into the shipping business on a
co-operative basis, they having prompted a
bygone Government to purchase the scows.
No extra police will be needed to cope with
the rush of agriculturists anxious to lose
money.
Stung by Country-party criticisms of his
migration agreement, which threatens to in-
volve the Westralian taxpayer in immense
losses, ex-Premier Mitchell hit back by read-
ing a letter from Thomson, the present
Cocky leader. The writer, addressing Mit-
chell, mentioned a report that he would be
included in Jimmy’s Cabinet if that body
didn’t already contain a Minister from a
neighboring electorate; admitted that he
would like to be in the Cabinet; and argued
that it was rough to be excluded for geogra-
phical reasons. The letter was written in
1921. when the Cockies were allied with the
Nationalists, and there was no talk of the
migration agreement; further, it was marked
“confidential.” Westralia thought better of
Mitchell.
Senator Pearce, Minister for the N. Ter-
ritory, declares that there has been no
delay in proceeding to search for the two
women supposed to have been cast away
among a rather nasty tribe of blacks in
March before last (1923). The question
now is whether Mr. Pearce knows delay
when he sees it.
Labor in Vic. has shown itself an apt pupil
at learning how to sugar-coat its bills. To
make compulsory voting, abolition of dual en-
rolment and a few other things in an elec-
toral measure easier to swallow. Chief Sec.
Tunnecliffe has added a proposal that retiring
politicians, if candidates for re-election, shall
draw pay up to the day before the date of
polling, instead of up to the day of dissolu-
tion or retirement. The man who invented
sliding panels for ballot-boxes was really a
clumsy hand at the business.
Vic.’s small army of railway employees is
now 27,619 strong—l9,os7 permanent and
8562 temporary. Of the total about 20,000
come under the Classification Board and
want also to be able to go to the Federal
Arbitration Court for another 4s. sd. a day
—lBs. 4d. instead of 13s. lid. An additional
shilling a day would mean £313,000 a year,
and that on top of a promised reduction of
railway freights amounting to £154.000 a
year. The profit for 1923-24 was only £27,000,
so a big deficit threatens. But Labor never
worries about deficits.
“Politicus” : Wren is still a power in the
Vic. Labor party. The new Ministers are
surrounded by such a horde of place-hunters
and wire-pullers that ordinary citizens find
it hard to get near them ; but all doors fly
open when the Boss appears. Writer had
business with one of the Ministers the other
day, and, while enduring the usual long wait
in the queue of job-seekers, heard the atten-
dant dealing with another line of applicants
on the ’phone. “The Minister is engaged,”
he chanted monotonously. Presently his tune
changed: “Oh yes, Mr. Wren; I’ll put you
through at once.”
“Nakhoda” looks in on a civil war:—
How Shanghai stands in the present upheaval in
China can be realised if you imagine Sydney supplied
with three times as many modern factories, and
sitting cheek-by-jowl with a squalid native city,
the streets and trams of the white city merging
into those of the yellow; with the rival generals
outside the city throwing explosive ironmongery at
each other over the housetops, outmanoeuvred armies
taking short cuts through the suburbs in order to
attack their enemies in the rear, and the main rail-
ways, built by British engineers with British capital,
being used by both sides for the transport of troops.
Now that Tokio has taken the count, Shanghai is the
biggest and richest city in Asia; but the ground it
is built on is only leased from China, so that all its
immense aggregation of European industry, which is
beginning to rival Manchester, is at the mercy of its
squabbling landlords. When trouble occurs, it
is curious to see how the little fleet of river gunboats
anchored in the Whangpu swells almost in a. night
into a huge international navy, with Britain’s flag
usually predominant.
The Hun hasn’t lost his eye for business,
so he is making tentative offers to be an
industrial father to the Irish Free State,
just as he was to Russia before the debacle.
The flattering proposition is to make Queens-
town the rival of Belfast as a shipbuilding
centre, and the South-of-Iroland man has no
overwhelming love for Belfast. The differ-
ence would be that the great Belfast industry
is owned inside the Empire, while the
Queenstown one would be owned outside.
One Belfast shipyard alone employs 20,000
hands, and if the Hun could establish him-
self on that scale in a corner of the British
Isles he would be pushing Kultur along to
some purpose.
It is anticipated that the annual water
deficit in Sydney this summer will be the
worst to date. The fact that the Ma State
has a Legislature which attends to every-
thing except business has hitherto prevented
anything effective being done in the matter,
but the conversation which has passed has
been plentiful enough. The Water and
Sewerage Board is a quaint affair. The
Board makes profits, but it has to hand them
over to the Government instead of watering
and sewering with them. Then it gets grants
(with difficulty) from the Government for
extensions, hut the financial year is often
well advanced before it has the money, and
it has to hand back the unspent part of it
when the year closes, and proceed to haggle
for a new lot. When a small and not very
wet community cultivates congestion to such
an extent that it owns the most swiftly-
growing city in the Empire, and especially
when that city has the washing habit, it re-
quires to hustle better than this to keep
pace with the demand.
The disappointment of S.A. prohibition-
ists at the Gunn Government’s refusal to
grant a referendum is still finding savage ex-
pression in print. But Estcourt Hughes, a
parson on the Dry side, has been frank
enough to furnish disproof of the frequent
claim that the Prohibitionists agreed to sup-
port. Labor at the general election in return
for an understood pledge. He has dug up
a list which shows that the Alliance support
went to eight Laborites, eight Cockies, 14
Liberals and an Independent, that lot having
declared for the referendum.
THE ALTRUIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Queensland Parliament has been discussing
Mr. Fihelly’s statement that he resigned the Agent-
General’s office because he found it ‘a sinecure, over-
run with graft.’ ”
To toil all day he firmly meant,
Eftsoons to seek his rest
With all the infinite content,
The glow of righteous zest
In tasks performed, that nightly warmed
The Village Blacksmith’s breast.
He thought to work like elephants
That grub plantation trees,
Like multitudes of hurrying ants
Or hives of strenuous bees;
As beavers do, and coolies, too,
And football referees.
To serve his country was his aim
’Mid London’s roar and throb,
Whereby his colleagues’ glad acclaim
And plaudits from the mob
Might come his way, besides the pay
Attaching to, the job.
To boost his Queensland he designed
And keep her on the map;
But when he slowly woke to find
He couldn’t do a scrap
That mattered there, he tore his hr.ir,
A disillusioned chap.
For honest work he looked around,
Unused to guile and craft.
Hard yacker. Only then he found—
It nearly sent him daft—
For graft quant, stiff, was scope enough,
But oh! ’twas Yankee “graft.”
It might have suited me or you ;
He viewed it with dismay,
A possie where there’s nought to do
Excepting draw the pay.
So, with a snort, he packed his port
And quietly came away.

that Joe Turnbull, the then champion axe-

And this in the winter of T 6

learned that the breastplate of

tub of bran when not in use. I
used to contrast it with the
guard of the F.A. camp, Zei-
toun, which had for its sole
equipment one ammunitionless
rifle among nine men, and muse
upon the early days at Broad-
meadows when I marched with
a large waddy at the slope.
“Beckington”: Some gaol governors have
quaint humanitarian notions. At Fremantle
(W.A.) a few years ago three convicted mur-
derers were awaiting the hangman’s atten-
tion, a Greek, a Jap and a Manilaman.
There were no relatives or friends from with-
out to crave a final interview, nor did any of
the three evince the faintest interest in reli-
gious ministrations; wherefore the heal
gaoler, a kindly soul, conceived the idea that
it might lighten his charges’ last day upon
earth (a Sunday) if they were permitted to
spend an hour in one another’s society, lie
even went to the length of providing an in-
terpreter, the most polyglot that could be
secured at short notice, to facilitate any ex-
change of views or sentiments that the
doomed beings might essay. But, as each

was a complete stranger to the other two,
and the only possible topic they had in com-
mon —the ceremony fixed for next morning—•
was hardly conducive to cheerfulness, the
interview, as the gaoler himself afterwards
admitted, didn’t “seem to do any of ’em much
good.” No record exists of the conversation.

“P. Pinktape” : My good friend Melbourne
Sun, reporting part of the proceedings of
the Science Congress, told us the other day
that “two years’ observations show that the
wind within the Antarctic Circle averages
43.2 m.p.h., or five times as much as Adel-
aide.”
Is this a subtle, unkind slur?
And, if it is, just what’s the joke?
The cold, antarctic breezes whir,
Driving the powdered snow like smoke
O’er icebound hill, and plain and glade,
Five times as fast as Adelaide.
Is Adelaide so fast that it
Is standard in a test of speed—-
A gauge to measure winds that flit?
Perchance it’s fastness makes the need
For all the churches which upraise
Their lofty steeples in the haze.
Or is it Adelaide is slow—
So slow the cold antarctic wind
Sweeps by in scorn ? I do not know—-
Make the solution suit your mind.
There’s much in life, I km afraid,
Five times as fast as Adelaide!

“The Deacon” : There is at least one youth
in N. S. Wales whose faith in “scraps of
paper” has been shaken. He shared the
affections of an equally lighthearted maiden
with the rest of the gang, and seems to have
had some claim to be considered first favo-
rite. Anyhow, when trouble threatened she
went to the length of offering to
leave him out of it. But his bush-
lawyer instincts were not satisfied with
the girl’s spoken promise, and he in-
duced her to put it down in black and
white. Unfortunately the gist of the docu-
ment got about, and so alarmed the youth’s
fellows that they all faded away. Secure
in what he regarded as his certificate of inno-
cence, Don Juan stood his ground; but when
he was hauled up for prelim, expenses a
discerning T.M. callously disregarded the
document, and made an order. Still rely-
ing on the written word, defendant went to
the Appeal Court, where Rolin, J., quoting
the French tag that “he who excuses himself
accuses himself,” ordered the original Bench
warrant to stand.
“Nakhoda” rediscovers a settlement: —
The new bridge across Middle (Sydney) Harbor
at Roseville, not yet open for wheeled traffic, but
negotiable on foot, lured me the other day to the
discovery of a forgotten Land of Canaan. It lies
buried in the wilds of French’s Forest, and how you
get to it from the other side I don’t know, though
I suspect the Government may have provided, among,
other things, a subsidised aeroplane service. It
was a pleasant enough looking Eden at first glance
—32 well-built houses, surrounded by citrus orchards,
good roads, a recreation hall, a store (closed) and a
toy factory (also closed), equipped with an oil-
engine and a couple of wood-turning lathes. On
closer inspection, however, the Eden proved to be all
snake. A curly-headed, aesthetic-looking man at the
post office told me he was manager of the toy factory,
but that the 10 cobbers he had started with had all
drifted away, leaving him the plant and a mortgage
to keep it company, although there was a market
in Sydney for all the toys they could have made. He
was turning out as much as the 16 unidentified shell
fragments in his body would let him, as well as
providing his fellow-settlers with milk and vegetables.
The block he lived on had been presented to its first
tenant by the Voluntary Workers, who, in the white
heat of post-war civilian enthusiasm, had built the
house, fenced the land, and stocked it with 1000 fowls:
the ex-Digger who had had this largesse showered
on him wasn’t interested in poultry, and allowed the
queer things to grow wings and fly away. The
orchards, not having wings, were still there, but they
weren’t supporting the original tenants; the Govern-
ment was doing that. I don’t know know where the
Eves of this melancholy Eden were, but on my way
home I passed a dozen of its Adams working on the
road.

“Cartot”: The “strong” of tlie claim of
T. E. Harper, of Dubbo (N.S.W.), to the
so-called Angell millions will go into a par.
The sum waiting in Chancery for an owner,
and estimated at GO millions or so, repre-
sents the accumulated estate of one John
Angell, a London merchant of the eighteenth
century. He was a bachelor; the difficulty
has been to find the nearest male heir.
Angell’s elder sister, Rebecca, married a Har-
per ; their son Thomas Harper came to Aus-
tralia in 1802, and started business in Syd-
ney as a boatbuilder. In 1843, Harper sailed
from Sydney for the Islands in a cutter,
built by himself, and named The Sisters.
The next thing heard of this vessel, some
years later, was that it had been attacked
by natives in the Loyalty Group, and that
the owner and all the crew had been
killed and eaten. The present claimant is
a grandson of the Harper who went to feed
the islanders. One valuable piece of evidence
that he has been unable to locate is the
log-book of the cutter, which would establish
beyond doubt that his grandfather was
aboard the craft. There is a story that it.

DAFFODILS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the first of the Spring,
Alien September’s fresh winds through the city came
sweeping,
Hastening to bring
Memories of meadows and fleecy lambs leaping
Close by their mothers —
AVhen all the others,
Feeling the sweetness of Spring in the air,
Knowing the sunshine more radiantly fair,
Yet thought of nought
But. the dust of the city, the grit of its lanes,
Saw nothing more than the grimed window panes,
AVith the soot on the sills—
Davy saw daffodils.
By the old borders, scented and slim,
Wearing their frilly gold bonnets for him,
High in the hills,
There grew a garden Davy knew well,
Primrose and violet, blue elfin bell,
Rows of green ladies hooded in gold,
Tossing their gay little heads in the cold,
Clear through the smoke and the grime of the mills,
Davy saw daffodils. >
Like a dreamland afar
Davy’s lost garden lay, lone and neglected,
AVith gate ajar
Surely for someone the flowers expected,
Else why remember
Each new September
All to come up from the brown earth and wait,
Looking for Davy to come through the gate?
They could not know
As they waited each day in the sun or the rain
The garden would never see Davy again
Climbing home through the hills,
Dreaming of daffodils.
By the old pathways dancing with glee,
Shaking their bonnets in wild revelry,
Down by the mills,
Through the grey city, street after street,
DaA'y was walking with weariful feet;
Sometimes the roses, red and rain-wet,
Laughed from the windows, • bade him forget;
But Davy’s heart was away in the hills,
Hid in the daffodils.

“Loco” sticks another type of motor-hog:
“Two Seas’ ” par on dangers that beset motorists on
the highway (B. 28/8/’24) gives me a yearn-
h to make this same class see things
troin an engineman’s viewpoint. I am approach-
ilJg a level crossing “protected” with cattle
nits or grids. A motor-car is on the road about
the same distance at right angles from the crossing,
and travelling at similar speed, say, 30 miles an
hour I whistle, but there is no slackening of his
„ace" (Motorists tell me a loco, whistle cannot
easily be heard from a travelling motor-car; all the
more reason for a car-driver to look both ways when
approaching a railway crossing.) 1 whistle again,
furiously, without effect. We are each within 100
yards of the crossing now. No use my “shutting off ’
and applying brakes. I can’t stop anyway. I can
only whistle again, and as I approach the crossing
the motor-car stops in a length or two, the driver
laughing at me as I pass him. No doubt he saw the
train before I saw his car. Why can't a motorist
o-ive some indication that he sees the train, either
by holding out his hand or by slowing down well
back? It would save enginemen many a nerve-racking,
moment or two. Of course, all motorists are not so
thoughtless. Some so reduce their speed that we
can see at once that they are ready to stop. And often
they so time their movement that they roll quietly
over the line behind the train without stopping.
1 often feel I would like to stop and shake hands
with these; the others I would gladly punch on the
nose.

“H. Horsecollar”: Weeks have passed since
the auxiliary oil-drum schooner Huddersfield,
with no wireless and doing one knot, left
Darwin to rescue two white women, sus-
vivors of the long-lost Douglas Mawson.
They were said to be in the hands of Black
Brother in the wildest part of Australia,
which is Arnheim Land, on the left side of
the big Gulf, and even more dangerous coun-
try than a Melbourne suburb. The arrival of
some scraps of news from the relief expedi-
tion, and the promise of more in about three
weeks or a month or two, has aroused iu-
JUST A LITTLE MISHAP.
SOCITY MOTHER: “I’ve put the rest of the children to bed, nurse;
hut this one is'awfully naughty and refuses to go.”
HORRIFIED NURSE : “Good gracious, madam, that is Mrs. Brown's
child from next door!”
terest in the story of the captives. It ap-
pears that report has been wandering up and
down the coast since very shortly after the
loss of the Douglas Mawson, and that bits
of the wreck were located very early by an
individual who tried hard to get a hearing
on the topic of possible survivors, but with-
out much success. It is alleged, nevertheless,
that a search was made some time ago—
something in the way of a search. No special
expedition was sent, but the Government
steamer, John Alec, which has never been
known to be more than six months behind
with the provisions at Borroloola, was pass-
ing, and two policemen were instructed to go
ashore and stay not more than 48 hours. But
the navy was running late, so the time was
cut down to something more like 48 minutes,
and even Stefansson at his best could hardly
discover a new tribe of Eskimo in that brief
span. This tale puts Senator Pearce’s de-
THE CONSOLER.
MISSIONARY: “During the three years we were on the island my
wife saw only one white face. That was mine.”

partment in an invidious position. It can
hardly say it wholly disbelieved in the possi-
bility of there being castaways, else how
account for the two policemen and the 48
hours? But, always a creature of routine,
the Minister’s explanation will probably be
that he had received no written application
on foolscap from any captives requesting a
relief expedition. The business epitomises
the Territory’s official inertia and the Terri-
tory’s official pace. It is the natural lot of
a place which is very far from the seat of
Government, and has not voting members
who can withdraw their support when peeved.

“Herodot”: Touching war wounds, the
most agonising in my experience was sus-
tained by an Australian officer who was act-
ing as observer from a captive-balloon. A
German ’plane came over the lines and
commenced firing
incendiary bullets
to put the balloon
out of action. One
struck him just
over the left breast,
and lodged against
his collar-bone:
but he retained
sufficient presence
of mind to jump
from the mass of
flame, and utilise
his parachute. He
reached the ground
in a semi-conscious
condition, and it
was some hours
before the bullet had
been extracted. It
was only a small
one, but the phos-
phorus preparation
of which it was
composed had
caused it to burn
in his shoulder like
a live coal. Though
the wounded man
was only 25 years
old and the picture
of robust health
before that night,
liis hair had soon turned completely white
and his mind began to give way. He died
within six months.

“8.H.”: At the finish of an interpleader
matter before the Auckland Police Court the
other week, one of the lawyers engaged under-
took to pay the court costs himself. “They
amount only to 75.,” announced the Clerk’
of the Court. “I make it 95.,” corrected the
police-sergeant. The Clerk did some rapid
calculating. “No, we’re both wrong—it’s
I 15.,” he intimated decisively. This gave
Costs an opportunity. His fervent “Thank
God, it’s only two bob rises!” closed the
interlude.
“Farleigh”: One thing that sticks out
when one considers modern crimes and crimi-
nals is the facility with which in crowded
lands a man can get away from the most
lurid and damning past. Mahon, hanged
by this time for
one of the most re-
volting murders on
record, must have
appeared even to
the English jury
who tried him, as
well as to the
woman whom he
captivated and
butchered, a debon-
air and engaging
person, exception-
ally well mannered
and dressed. To
his n u merous
acquaintances of
the last year lie
was a likeable fel-
low with a £750-
a-year job in a
London firm of
good standing, and
the affable secre-
tary of a suburban
bowling club in his
leisure hours. Not
till he was con-
victed did the jury
get a glimpse into
liis real past, which
included one sen-
tence of 12 months
for forgery and an-
other of five years
for burglary and a
violent assault on
a woman—the last
incurred as late as
1916. His wife, of
course, knew these
things, but appa-
rently nobody else
who might have
used the knowledge
to the polished
scoundrel’s disad-
vantage. Even
four or five years
of Dartmoor scorn to have left no more out-
ward mark on Mahon than if they had been
spent in a Government office.

“Bildad” on monarchs he has met: —
Archaeologists have hoped that, despite the decay
ot monarchical institutions, some few princes and
kings (assorted . sizes), and perhaps an emperor,
might survive as specimens, just as a few mammoths
should have remained as samples, along with the last
Cobb’s coach, but didn’t; Unhappily, the stupidity
of many of the royalties and the ingratitude of
others makes the salving of them difficult. The war
cleared a number away, some unavoidably because the
great War Lord dragged them into a position which
made them unpopular, and some, fik: «ne Czar, be-
cause they knew no better. The ,>reek royal family will
probably disappear Wo r.he crowd in a generation
or two, because the last king lacked the foresight to
bring sufficient of his subjects’ money away with him.
The Caliph would appear to be just missing. Some
day, it may be, an old man with a fez will come
round to the back door in quest of victuals and
prove to be this ex-potentate, but even that trace
may not remain. A sample whom even the best
archaeologists couldn’t keep on his feet, if the stories
told of him are half true, is the son of the late
sultan Abdul Hamid. His proper name is Abdul
Juggins, and he got off to Hungary with a pile oi
wealth and 15 wives. He spent the money wealth,
and then pawned his other belongings for an absurdly
small sum to a local financier named Abrahamovitch,
who has now foreclosed and wants to sell the wives
on the plea that Turkish women are property. Abdul
Juggins will now probably begin to acquire police-
court convictions, and ultimately wander off the map.
* * * *
“The Listening-Insect” : One of the weird
habits of the ether wave is that it gallops at
a velocity of 186,000 miles a second, while
sound waves limp a paltry 1100 feet. The
result is that the music of a broadcasted
Sydney concert has impinged on my ear at
North Shore a vulgar fraction of a second
before it has reached the audience sit-
ting in the concert hall, and I am
already on my way to bed before the
last echo of the National Anthem has
allowed the concert crowd to scramble
for the doors. It was pleasant to know that,
on the last nights of the Grand Opera Co.,
without having to stand all the evening in a
queue or reserve seats at fabulous prices, one
would be getting in to Dal Monte’s glorious
voice before the golden horde of first-and-last
nighters. Unfortunately this hustling habit
of electricity has an objectionable side: the
prompter’s voice, borne on the tired waves of
sound, never reaches the front row- of the
stalls, whereas it is picked up, magnified by
the ether, and flung across the housetops a
good deal louder than the singers’ voices. As
Melba’s troupe seem to have chronically bad
memories, one heard more prompting than
singing.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: The grace of God put
in some detective work in Melbourne the
other day. An outlaw drifted into a Sal-
vation Army meeting, and a particularly
nowerful bit of exhorting drew him to the
penitent form. He was told that before he
joined the blood-aiul-tire force his .soul would
have to be freed from the burden of unexpi-
ated crimes ; and the result was that surprised
detectives were presently listening to the
account of a recent robbery which had
baffled all their attempts to sheet it home
to somebody. A Salv’army otlicer went bail
for the convert when he was committed for
trial, and the twin facts that his own con-
fession placed him in the dock and that he
has ottered restitution of the stolen goods
mav stand him in good stead.
’ * * * *
“llamer”: A remarkable odyssey is that
of a man of Fitzroy (Melb.) who was some
sort of hanger-on or camp-follower of the
classic push known as the Reillys or Rovers,
lie was certainly no rover himself, tor he
had never been further from ’Roy than the
city proper until he went to South Mel-
bourne to give his moral support to the
Reillys, who had some sort of professional
engagement there against a rival clan. The
stay-at-liis-own-corner man became detached
from his crowd, and either did not have the
energy to inquire the ivay home, or lacked
confidence in anybody to put him right.
Anyway, he stayed in South Melbourne,
finding work and a lodging there. AY hen he
lost his job he found another at Albert Park,
and so through several spheres of utility
worked his way round until at last, indulging
in a ramble one Sunday, he struck surround-
ings that seemed familiar. It was his home
paddock—and the next day saw him restored
to the family circle from which he had been
missing for six months. His explanation
that he had not known how to get home
seems to have been accepted by his family.
* * * *
“Howitzer”: Queer casualties? Bluey
had proved himself a good soldier on the
Peninsula, but his war-shattered nerves had
given way more than once before he made
the eighth in an isolated pill-box in No Man’s
Land near Ypres. A big move by Fritz on
our sector was projected for 5 on the follow-
ing morning, and as our barrage would fall
50 yards behind us, it was obvious, that any
attempt at retirement would be suicide. “Tim
sooner to-morrow comes the better for me!”
I heard Bluey mutter when our platoon com-
mander outlined the programme. He and I
were in an advanced listening-post 20 yards
out from the pill-box. AA T e had two Mills
bombs each, and instructions to use them
the moment a Fritz was sighted. Bluey
clutched one in each hand, and begged me
to take the pins out; I complied, and just
kept my own two bombs handy. About 5
a.m. in the ghastly half-light of dawn, a
shower of green flares rose from the Hun
trenches. Bluey, with a queer gurgle, jumped
a few paces forward and fell; he was dead
before I reached him, with the two bombs

of it was that the green rockets were evi-

The 1928 financial year, owing to stagnation
in the coastal carrying-trade and to coal-mine
strikes, gave the Melbourne S.S. Co. only
£81.610 of profit, according to the published
accounts. For the past 12 months the fleet
was well employed, yet the accounts show
only £87,132 won from trading and invest-
ments, and that was but £1572 more than
was taken by the usual divs. In their
report issued prior to the recent 10 p.c.
advance the directors said: “The current
rates of freight are inadequate, in face of
the high working expenses afloat and ashore,
to give a satisfactory return upon the capital
cost of the steamers.” What the shipping-
proprietor considers a “satisfactory return,”
however, is generally different from what the
ordinary investor would be content with.
Nevertheless, taking into consideration the
interest earnings of £200,000-odd of funds
invested outside the business, the amount
of disclosed profits which can be allotted
to shipping operations is obviously small.
But there are several special features which
must be considered. One is that cargo-
carrying has lately been conducted with five
steamers with a gross tonnage of 16,446 as
against nine steamers and 22,216 tons just
after the war started. With this smaller
fleet the directors are endeavoring to find
divs. for £366,000 as against £204.000
10 years back. The only new cash
got in from shareholders during that
period was £26.000 in 6 p.c. cum. prefs.,
no less than £136,000 of bonus ordinary scrip
having been issued. As ordinaries are receiv-
ing 10 p.c. regularly, equal to more than
164 p.c. on 1915 holdings, they have nothing
to grumble about, even though the current
divs. are made possible only by the returns
from investments which were hoarded out of
surplus war-time profits and by selling
steamers during the shipping boom at prices
greatly in excess of written-down book
values. So big was the war harvest that,
including investments covering the deprecia-
tion of steamers, the bonus-inflated capital
of £366,000 is now helped by £348,729 of
visible reserves. Funds have, therefore, to
earn only 5 p.c. to give the prefs. 6 p.c. and
show 10 p.c. on ordinary capital.
It is questionable whether the profits
shown in any year’s published accounts can
be accepted as a reliable guide to the actual
earnings of the period, because profits are
shown less unspecified appropriations for
depreciation, and that provision appears to
have been very liberal in prosperous times.
Possibly not so much has been set 1 aside in
recent years of smaller earnings; but not
counting any extractions for bonus scrip, in
10 years reserves for depreciation, special
renewals and replacements, bad debts, etc.,
have expanded from £102,852 to £266.878.
Deducting these reserves, steamers and plant
now have a net book value of £204,504
gainst £237,283 in 1914. The liquid posi-
tion has developed in this extraordinary
manner, the gross book value oif ships,
wharves, premises, etc., also being shown :—■

Other assets £340,135 £440,514 £483,663 £518,209
In the introductory table visible additions to
reserves are counted as profit. To £37,132
shown by the directors for the past 12 months
has been added the net increase of £5768
in the depreciation, etc., reserves and £3479
dropped into an insurance fund. At .Tune
80. all except £151.700 of the £366,000 of
paid capital was represented by the surplus of
cash and easily-convertible assets over and
above all outside liabilities. To set against
the £151,700 there were the six steamers
with 19,467 gross tonnage (including the
s.s. Lowana, a recent purchase, which was
probably not fully paid for at the balanc-
ing date), 13 tugs, lighters, hulks and
launches, premises with a book value of
£46,827 and plant valued at £2545. The
co.’s tinances are, therefore, A 1 at Lloyds:
the management has command of large funds
with which it can add to the fleet whenever
it wishes without calling on shareholders.
Moreover, the latter have exceptional security
for all their bonus scrip as well as for the
cash originally invested.
Incidentally, the recent 10 p.c. rise in
freights on the disappearance of the Patrick
Co. is going to add more than 2s. in the £ to
revenue from cargo-carrying. The removal
of the “outside" competitor will mean the
curtailment of various services. Hitherto
there have been quite an unnecessary num-
ber of sailings. These will now be arranged
with more regard to actual necessities.

Walkers has been one of the few engineering
concerns in the Commonwealth —in the
world, in fact—which did not suffer a set-
back in the period of severe competition and
depression which followed the war. It had
the good luck to have the construction of
several steamships in hand for tin l Common-
wealth Government at the time of the col-
lapse, and though the Government cried off
when one vessel had been launched Walkers
was compensated, perhaps not only for the
work in hand, but also to an extent for capi-
tal outlay on slips and equipment. The
Queensland Government has also stood
solidly behind the old co. with orders. Dur-
ing the past 12 months the construction of
10 locos, for Brisbane suburban railways
and the superstructure for a railway bridge
over the Burnett River were the principal jobs
in hand, and they and odds-and-ends easily
provided the usual 10 p.c. divs. The intro-
ductory table shows a heavy fall in profits,
but the figures there include £7826 for 1022
and £18,500 for 1923 which had been added
to reserves, but which were not treated as
earnings in the Profit and Loss accounts.
Possibly adjustments subsequent to the
abandoning of tlic Commonwealth’s ship-
building schemes brought in these titbits,
and no doubt they should be treated as
special profits, or at least be spread over a
period rather than he credited to any particu-
lar accounting terms. Apart from them, how-
ever, earnings have slackened : 1022, £22,652 ;
1923, £21,402 ; 1024, £18,014. In every case
these surpluses are subject to allowances for
depreciation, which for some years has been
regularly provided for at the rate of £2750
p.a. Works, plant and all equipment now
appear in the books at £79,421, and on the
other side £39,500 has been accumulated in
the depreciation account and £12,500 more
in a plant replacement reserve, while
±lO,OOO is held in a suspense account. The
£43,008 in the introductory table does not
include these reserves; they are made up of
general reserves, £10,000; div. equalisation
reserve. £22,753: insurance reserve, £7500;
and £2844 Profit and Loss carry-forward.
They are helpful in producing divs. for
£124,193 of paid capital.
A feature of Walkers nowadays is that
the portion of funds tied up in works and all
manufacturing equipment is comparatively
small. Here is a 10 years’ survey of balance-
sheet figures:—
1914 1921 1993 1994
Liabilities .. £58,350 £135,354 £53,405 £48,554
Fixed assets . . 44,531 84,478 35,949 39,921

Completed work,
cash, deposits,
etc., . . 86,437 103,976 110,424 87,490
The book value of fixed assets was at its
peak in 1020—£115,108 gross, or £86,608
if the £28.500 depreciation reserve was de-
ducted. The entry has since dwindled to
£39.021 —£79.421 less a depreciation reserve
of £39.500. The changes in the ten and four
years in the liquid position have been: —
1914. 1920. 1924.
Liquid assets .. £158,214 £162,082 £213,592
Liabilities . . 58,350 98,572 48,554
Liquid surplus .. £99,864 £63,510 £165,038
Liquid assets include £07,108 of War Loan
and shares —the latter are unspecified, but
are understood to be the best of securities —
mostly bank shares at a good deal less than
market values —stocks (£28,904) and the
estimated value of completed work under
contracts, which is as good as cash if the
jobs are true to specifications. The figures
in the last column above show that at June
30 the co. was in the extraordinarily strong
position, after providing for the year’s 10
p.c. div. and after having distributed a simi-
lar amount to celebrate the 60tli anniversary
of the establishment of the business in Bal-
larat, of showing the whole of the capital of
£124,193, and £28,426 besides, represented by
the surplus of liquid assets over and above
all liabilities. That in itself gives share-
holders a backing of 245. 7d. for every £1
paid share. The properties and all
plant and equipment capable of turn-
ing out high-grade work are additional.
The co. is, therefore, so snugly financed that
provided work is available —a big sugar-mill
is at present under construction at Tally
(N.Q.) and also a twin-screw hopper-dredge
for the Queensland Government —earning of
good divs. should be fairly easy. Consider-
ing the volume of orders put through in the
past few years, and considering also the
funds invested outside the business and earn-
ing good divs., disclosed net earnings have
been slender. A detailed examination of the
accounts does not suggest that much more
than is disclosed has been earned, unless, of
course, plant additions have been charged
against revenue. Probably severe competi-
tion has kept contract prices close to the
bread-line. However, the co. has held its
ground admirably; under normal conditions,
and particularly if North Queensland
comes into its own, Walkers should continue
to prosper. Nevertheless, the market is pessi-
mistic. as it is in respect of most industrials
that are large employers of labor; its offer
of 245. 6d. for scrip is no more than the book
value of assets apart from engineering be-
longings. Lately there has been a shareholder
willing to quit at 275.

Adelaide is very proud of the Holden motor-
body building enterprise and its meteoric rise,
and when early this year the co. issued
£200,000 of prefs. whose divs. are limited to
8 p.c. cumulative almost a half-million was
offered. The Holden firm is a very old one;
it began in 1856 as a saddlery and leather
business, but coach-building now monopolises
attention, leather interests having been sold
to Harris, Scarfe, Ltd., last year. Motor-
body building commenced in December, 1917,
when Holdens purchased Fred Hack’s Adel-
aide works. The phenomenal expansion of
the business is shown by this comparison of
four years' balance-sheet figures:—
1921. 1922. 1923. 1924.'

In three years the balance-sheet total
has expanded from £216,296 to £873,389.
The past year’s profits were considerably
larger than the capital represented by tan-
gible assets in the 1921 financial year.
Three years’ production of bodies and the
value of output have been : 1922, 4190 bodies,
£357,643; 1923. 9518, £775,474; 1924,
18,107. £1,404,650. The wages bill for the
past 12 months was £438.463 compared with
£75,869 only two years back. The current
year is expected to make new records; works
in S. Aus., Vic., N. S. Wales and Queens-
land have been expanded, re-organised and
equipped with latest machinery, and orders
in hand give promise of an output of more
than 10.000 bodies for the half-year to
December 31 compared with just over 6000
for the same period of last year. The S.
Aus. works are now equipped to turn out
tramcars and other rolling stock, and spring-
cushion and electro-plating activities arc
already producing profits.
Notwithstanding the £200,000 put in by
prefs. a few months ago and £65,000 more
subscribed by ordinaries, so much money has
been required for new properties, works,
stocks and customers’ accounts that liabili-
ties increased by £138.000 during the past
12 months. The directors did not lose their
heads during the expansion; so far ordi-
naries’ divs. have not been lifted above 10
p.c. p.a., all surplus profits having been left
in the business. In four years nearly
£175.000 has thus accumulated, and that is
only £20,000 less than present ordinary capital.
Meanwhile, though the management lias been
making casy-money, it has not overlooked
the safeguarding the future by adopt-
ing modern business practice: during
the past 12 months “the question of scien-
tific management has had serious attention,
and a cost-accounting system, material-
control and production system have been in-
troduced.” The application of these systems
and of proved overseas manufacturing
methods should establish the big business on
a thoroughly sound basis for future produc-
tion and thus enable the co. to hold the
trade it has won against almost any com-
petition with which it may be threatened,
and already its astonishing success has
prompted the establishment of several small
body-building works, and one big engineering
firm at least has been considering whether
motor-car equipment is worth tackling in a
big way.
At June 30 Holdens had £442.644 in
properties, works and plant in four States.
Its own funds at that date amounted to
£570,449 —£395,000 of paid capital and
£175.449 of reserves. Liquid assets (almost
wholly stocks and book debts) had a book
value of nearly £400.000; outside lia-
bilities (including a mortgage of £29,926)
amounted to £302,940. So the eo.’s position
was not uncomfortable. If further funds
are needed for expansion of the business in
States other than S. Aus. the management
should have no difficulty in raising capital,
perhaps by another issue of prefs.—the con-
ditions of the last issue permit £lOO.OOO
more to be offered on the same, terms.
Ordinaries are in an enviable position;
provided profits are maintained on anything
like the current scale their div. prospects are
exceptionally bright. For the 12 months to
.Tune 30, after writing off goodwill (£15,150)
and pref. share exes. (£7526) and adding
£59,265 to reserves—plant and machinery,
£16,830 ; buildings, £16,000 ; bad and doubt-
ful debts, £2000; insurance, £5000; taxation,
£19,434 —almost £35,000 of the year’s profit
remained, giving 154 p.c. on £195,000 of
ordinary capital when the prefs.’ divs. had
been deducted. In specific reserves £81,664
was held at June 30, and unless serious mis-
takes have been made in the rapid expan-
sion of the business £60,000 or so of that can
be regarded as accumulated profit apart from
taxation liability. When the year’s divs.
had been paid there were tangible assets
(anart from provision for taxes) with a book
value of £306,600 to work for £195,000 of
ordinary capital. Every £1 pref. share was
supported by 50s. 7d. of tangible assets.

Australian Knitting Mills is one wing of a
combing, spinning and knitting enterprise;
the other wing is Yarra Falls, Ltd., for-
merly Yarra Falls Spinning Co. Hitherto
Yarra Falls has operated as a proprietary
concern and has issued no accounts; but in
May last it was reconstructed, shares were
listed on ’Change, and in future its figures, or
so many of them as the directors may decide,
will be published. Because the A.K.M. holds
31.8,500 shares in the spinning concern, its
own published figures are not of much value
without a view of the assets representing
that holding. It is obvious, however, that
the big undertaking has done surprisingly,
notwithstanding the competitive condition of
the trade since overseas manufacturers made
a bold bid to recapture the Australian mar-
ket with more cheaply-produced goods. To
have paid an average of 11§ p.c. p.a. for
three years on capital which has moved from
£329,625 to £450,000, and which includes
£90.000 of bonus scrip, has been a great
achievement. The A.K.M. was not alto-
gether a war-baby, of course. It was knit-
ting with imported yarns 20 years back, and
had developed into a limited liability co. by
1910 to enable additional capital to be intro-
duced. The curtailment of wool supplies
during the war prompted the formation of a
co. to produce wool-tops, yarns and worsteds,
and the A.K.M. found unexpected support for
the new enterprise. P. H. Pearce and Son.
the Melbourne wool-buyers, and a crowd be-
hind Salts. Ltd., one of the big Yorkshire
textile mills, supplied the financial backing,
and Sir Henry Whitehead, one of the largest
individual English wool-spinners, supervised
the establishment of the mills. Here are
some figures showing how spinning interests
have affected the A.K.M.:—

The falling off of knitting profits for flic past
12 months- was mostly accounted for by a fire
which completely destroyed the underwear
section of the mills in January last; a larger
loss than had been at first thought was sus-
tained. Nevertheless, net profits shown by
the accounts and treated as distributable
did not decline. Rut the improvement in re-
turns from wool-tops and spinning did not
make the record. To the earnings from manu-
facturing were added the bonus shares from

CONCESSIONAIRES FOR AUSTRALIA:
GUTHRIDGE LIMITED,
Parramatta Road, Camperdown (just beyond University), Sydney.
the Yarra Falls Co. when it reconstructed;
that concern capitalised profits equal to £1
in £5 of its paid capital. A.K.M. profits
for the 12 months were, therefore, made up in
this way:—
Gross profits, after making fire'adjustments,
and interest .. .. .. .. £20,079
Less expenses.. .. .. .. 11,757
Net profit from knitting .. .. £8,322
Yarra Falls divs. . . . . .. .. 22,295
Total net profit .. .. £30,617
Yarra Falls bonus scrip . . . . .. 41,590
Profits as per table .. .. .. £75,207
The year's 10 p.c. div. was, therefore, ap-
proximately £ll,OOO more than net earnings
apart from bonus scrip credited as profit.
However, the co.’s own finances, despite dis-
location caused by the fire, were sufficiently
snug to warrant drawing on cash reserves.
Here are some more figures showing the posi-
tion at June 30 and the changes since 1918:
1918. 1919. 1923 1924
Paid capital . . £60,000 £139,900 £405,000 £450,000
Liabilities . . 3,484 9,890 52,138 52,789
Property, plant
and machinery 28,914 34,163 142,063 143,733

Cash, etc. . . 29,832 875 30,396 47,561
Yarra Falls shares Nil 88,334 222,950 293,020
Liabilities were made up of £44,789 of cur-
rent debt and an £BOOO mortgage. On the
other side were Government securities and
cash for £47,561. Stocks, book debts and
other liquid assets (not including Yarra Falls
scrip) were about £115,500 larger than all out-
side liabilities. This end of the big enterprise
is, therefore, very healthy, but it is so closely
linked with the Yarra Falls that that con-
cern’s figures are necessary to survey the
enterprise satisfactorily. Having done so
well during the period of development and in
most difficult selling markets, the future looks
bright. A new factory, of the “most modern
design and being equipped with the latest
and most efficient machinery procurable,” is
replacing the one destroyed. Incidentally, in
the introductory table goodwill (£25,000)
is not treated as an asset, but reserves
£64,599 over and above that amount have
accumulated —£50,000-odd of them in seven
years, but as that includes Yarra Falls bonus
scrip, and some of the £293,020 holding there
may be represented by goodwill, the true
financial position of the business is obscure
until that co.’s accounts are available.

The Australian Provincial Assurance is
still picking up odds-and-ends of life business
which other offices have wearied of or which
are too small to give any prospect of profit.
This time it is the Westfalian connection of
tin* Queensland Probate Insurance Co.
which has been acquired on “terms mutually
satisfactory to both parties.” Judging by
the Q.P.l.’s last published balance-sheet, this
probably means that the young Queensland
office is very pleased to be relieved of the
accruing liability under policies in that dis-
tant field.
“Old Banker”: An insidious attempt has
just been made to weaken the base of our
banking edifice —the savings branch. Cussen,
Acting-C. J. of Victoria, recently gave the
United Commercial Travellers’ Association
authority to amend its memorandum of asso-
ciation to enable it to establish a Savings
Fund for the benefit of the individual mem-
bers of the Association. The C.T.A. can
now presumably open a savings bank in every
State of the Commonwealth, and from what
one knows of its power to do things effici-
ently these banks will soon be established.
The objects of the new clause are to afford
the members of affiliated associations facili-
ties for saving regular or casual sums and
placing them on deposit at interest. That
is innocent enough, and the new savings
banks may not seriously compete with the
.State and Commonwealth institutions. Yet
it is the thin end of the wedge, because a
precedent having been established the Court
will have difficulty in declining similar appli-
cations by other associations, such as friendly
societies and trades unions. The savings-
bank system in the United States should be
sufficient warning to put a stop to private
persons being allowed to get into the business
in the Commonwealth. In TJ.S.A. the system
lias been abused, and there are numerous
instances of big savings banks owmed and
managed by private people who arc not sub-
ject to Government control. In Australia
we are fully supplied with Government offices
that are efficient, safe and sound, and no
others ought ever to be allowed.

The. tragedy of the Commonwealth’s oil-
shale industry is so fresh in the memory of
investors, and money is at present so tight,
that the “Wild Cat” has a lot of sympathy
for the crowd w r ho are trying to resurrect
interest in the Murrurundi (N.S.W.) deposits
fiy issuing an elaborate prospectus in a
childs’ picture-book cloak. A \s to the quality
and quantity of the Murrurundi oil-shales
there is no question; efficient treatment at
reasonable cost has hitherto been the bugbear
in all attempts to work the high-grade N.
Wales deposits. The British Australian
Oil Co. thudded badly at Murrurundi. A
new type of retort, the Bronder, a U.S.A.
invention, is the keystone of the latest enter-
prise. A trial plant having operated success-
rully in Melbourne, one of double capacity
was erected in Sydney, and it is claimed to
have proved “beyond a shadow of doubt that
the greater the size of the plant the greater
efficiency can be obtained.” The new system
discards old methods by which the shale is
burned in retorts by external heat; the
Bronder furnace forces hot gases and vapors
through the shale by means of blowers, and
it is claimed to do as much work in 24
hours, and show higher recoveries and better
products, than ordinary retorts can accom-
plish in 24 to 48 hours. Many of the prin-
cipal shale-oil and refining experts, chemists
and geologists in the Commonwealth are
declared to have “reported favorably” on
operations of the experimental plants, and
on the strength of them the Australian Shale
Oil Corp., Ltd., with a half-million nominal
capital, is seeking funds to begin operations
on a large scale.
The big gamble is whether the Bronder
retort will produce so successfully on a
commercial scale as it has done experimen-
tally. One matter not made clear in a very
comprehensive prospectus is why the enter-
prising shale-oil specialists of the U.S. have
not adopted the system. It is at least due
to the Australian investor that he should be
told what success has been achieved by the
inventor in his own country, and whether
any plants are operating on a commercial
scale, and, if so, with what results. This
information is needed to justify the taking of
150,000 fl fully-paids for leases and plant
rights, even though the vendors' scrip will
not carry divs. until the public’s 200,000
shares have had 10 p.c. The promoters have
worked out figures showing a profit-return
of 61 p.c. on subscribed capital, but so many
chickens have been counted in the Australian
oil-shale industry before they were hatched
that the cautious investor will not hope for
anything so magnificent until the new retorts
have definitely proved their worth. He will
also discount many extravagant statements
made in the prospectus, which would have
been much more impressive if it had stuck
to hard facts and been made to look less
like a catalogue for a firm of prize-distribut-
ing traders.

Broken Hill is now in a position to do
without imported brimstone and produce all
the sulphuric acid required in its flotation
plants. The zinc concentrates carry about
30 p.c. sulphur, and there are now three
plants for roasting them —the third and
largest has just been installed by the Elec-
trolytic Zinc Co. on Block 14. Practically
no fuel is required: the burning sulphur
attends to that itself. The total Broken
Hill output is about 300 tons a week; and
there is that much less weight to be paid
for when the zincs are being carried to the
Itisdon works in Tasmania.

Mt. Isa Mines will shortly have its assay
laboratory in commission, and the addition
of values to its development reports will be
a much needed improvement. Although no
detailed figures have been given, shareholders
have reason to be well satisfied with values
m the Black Star and Black Rock lodes.
Sufficient work has already been done to
indicate that the Star is a good show in
itself. The Rock is reported to be bagging-
ore for nearly half the width of 14ft. Isa
lode values are on the low side, but. are con-
sidered payable. Its ore shows signs of con-
siderable leaching, and the sulphides are
nearly certain to register an improvement.
The Star lode in the Ibus lease has bright-
ened the Proprietary co.’s prospects.
* * * *
Mt. Morgan has not closed on its option
over the Ajax copper mine, Bajool (Q.).
After a little more than a year’s work the
lode has been opened up to a depth of 128 ft.
Copper values are good, but Morgan is look-
ing for gold, too, to help the copper ores in
l° w markets. The owners are at present
pushing on with development. The Ajax
is the show that geologist L. C. Ball con-
sidered so promising on surface indications:
a 15ft. width w-ent 8.6 p.c. copper. If it had
been discovered five years earlier, wlien the
red metal was booming, its owners would
now be on velvet.
* * * *
. Sardine North, Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.),
is after cash to drive a 500 ft. tunnel on a
large low-grade lode it has unearthed. This
show, alongside the Sardine, has been a
great disappointment, for though the Sardine
lode runs into its block rich shoots are
absent. The future is doubtful, but there
is a prospect of the new drive proving values
sufficient to warrant working the low-grade
stuff cheaply by open-cuts.
* * * *
The Titanic, Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.), is
again being worked in a small way by Mul-
hall and Keogh. The original holders were
bought out for £5OOO by the Towers Brilliant
Extended Co. during the Sardine boom, but
the show proved a duffer, the shoot pinching
out very quickly. The history of the field,
however, ought not to condemn the show 7
altogether, for most of the rich lodes are
little more than strings of lenses. The pre-
sent owners are on a good leader.
Brown’s Reward and Daisy Queen (W.A.)
have taken new options. For some months the
former has endeavored to sustain interest
with cheerful reports about the Paymaster
lease, at Kalgoorlie, but having suspended
operations there it is now busy boosting
the prospects of a near-by claim. ' The Pay-
master was billed as a place of enrichments ;
the new venture is featured as something
good on the same line as the Yorkshire Lass,
from which a party of miners recently
obtained several thousand pounds’ worth of
gold. Daisy Queen’s option is on the old
Vivien Gem. at Lawlers, and not far from
the show which has almost crippled the co.
financially. G. M. Roberts, after a cursory
inspection, is “favorably impressed,” and the
Daisy’s manager enthusiastically declares
that there isn’t another show available in the
West with prospects so good. The battery,
however, has not yet spoken, and develop-
ment still has to tell its tale.

Mick Williams, who was g.-m. of the Edna
May during its dividend-paying career, is
now known in the West as “the man from
Borneo.” On a recent visit to Java he
secured 18-montlis’ options over three oil con-
cessions and three coal areas in Borneo. Pur-
chase consideration is a £2OOO deposit and
£lOO,OOO cash. On the strength of elaborate
geological maps and data provided by Dutch
Government authorities, Williams floated in
Perth the Borneo Oil Option Syndicate,
i ll IO’OOO shares of 50s. each, of which
4000 have been issued, within a few hours.
A report by the best oil geologist available
is to be obtained without delay.

A few emeralds arc again being got at
Poonah (W.A.). The field is about 40 miles'
north-west of Cue, and some good stones
have been found in recent years. So far,
however, the gems have not been plentiful
enough to attract the option-seeker or co.-
promoter.

It looks as if M. I. Murehie did not pick
a blue-duck when he took up the Speck’s
Golden Gate gold show. Calls in the Janu-
ary half-year furnished £3354 of funds, and
gold only £1397; for the July term calls
were down to £2090 and gold up to £2073.
but advances jumped from £750 to £2030.
Financially there was drift, but progress
was made underground. Manager Miller
not only unravelled the tangled mainshaft
problem at No. 10, so that the tank could
be got to work to drain the lower levels, but
pushing out at No. 7 he struck a new run
of stone. Its grade has lifted values from
about 6dwt. to above 12dwt., and the make
is opening up well. As the shoot at No. 4
is petering out, Miller has been finding sup-
plies of ore by opening up connections be-
tween the levels down to No. 8. A run of
stone going underfoot at No. 9 will be avail-
able directly No. 10 can be made safe. With
a fresh make of ore to open up and old
formations developing, a new plant is to
be put into commission and the battery is
to work three shifts. All forfeited shares
have been sold, so that all contributing
shares are again subscribing. Cash neces-
sary to push ahead with development is,
therefore, assured. The new plant is ex-
pected to give profits; if it does, ill-fated
Badak, which took over the show when its
Malayan tin bubble burst, will again be in
the public eye.

The liquidator of the Tasmania gold-
mine is still nursing some of that co.’s assets.
Apple orchards are no longer fashionable,
so the sale of the Government and Kiln
estates hangs fire. No metallurgist bold
enough has been found to tackle the 100,009
tons of dump material, though they contain
20,0000 z. gold. Nor has the machinery-man
been a keen buyer of old plant. Meanwhile
the limestone deposits on the property hsve
been inspected to ascertain whether they are
suitable for cement-making. And bold
spirits still dream that if the old gold show
had electricity they could make it pay. The
Speck’s Ilydro-electric Department is will-
ing to lend a hand, so stranger things have
happened than a resurrection of the old
millionaire claim.

Buchan Manganese Mines. Iron, Steel and
Development Co., Ltd., has put forth a pre-
tentious prospectus in pursuit of £89,000 to
open up and work for manganese six mineral
leases in East Gippsland (Vic.). This is
only one of several attempts to raise capital
to work these superficial deposits. Twenty
years ago J. Colqulioun Thompson took this
property to London, where it was well in-
troduced mid fully considered by people con-
nected with Derbyshire iron and steel con-
cerns. Thompson had no luck, because not
enough work had been done to prove what
quantity of ore existed. There were in those
days four prospecting potholes from 30ft.
to 70ft. deep, which could scarcely be called
shafts, and the present prospectus does not
indicate that much more sinking or driving-
lias been done since. The question of car-
riage of ore to the coast was another difficult
problem, because the dirt roads of the dis-
trict could not bear heavy mineral traffic,
and 35 miles of railway would have been too
costly. The modern prospectus claims it
can draw from Yallourn, 100 miles away,
power- for electric furnaces to make
ferro-manganese and spigeleisen. T. Alwyn
Reynolds, in those days a loading London
steel chemist, carefully examined the pro-
position and suggested the use of the electric
turn ace. Reynolds took the matter to Aus-
tria, where more was known about the manu-
facture of ferro-manganese and spiegeleisen
in the electric furnace, but he failed to in-
terest the Germans. The promoters propose
to spend £.‘looo on plant and machinery,
again making the old error of erecting a
plant before finding out how much or how
little manganese there is below the ground.

Prendergast is George IV. among Vic.
Premiers. The other three were Kerferd,
Turner and Elmslie. Kerferd reigned for
872 days, Turner (two turns) 1980 days,
Elmslie 13 days.
Twelve of the members of Vic. Assembly
have served in overseas wars. Slater,
Webber, Hughes, Pollard and McDonald
(Labor), Bourchier (Cocky), Baird, Morley,
Argyle and Eggleston (Nasliers) were in
the Big Scrap. Bailey and Wallace (Labor)
helped to hammer Kruger.
Colonel Brinsmead, the Controller of Avia-
tion, who recently made a flawless round-
Australia flight, probably owes something to
the fact that he is son-in-law of Charlie
McDonald, M.H.R., a former Speaker; but
he has justified his selection. Forty-one
years old now, he came to Australia at the
age of 19, and when the war came he enlisted
as a private in Melbourne. His commission
came to him in Egypt, and later he received
wounds and the M.C. at P'ozieres. It was
the ache of his injuries in marching which
caused him to secure a transfer to the Flying
Corps; and as an administrator in that sec-
tion he received notice which led to his
selection as a member of the military wing of
the British Peace Conference delegation.
The big textile business of George A. Bond
found a good general in J. T. Conover, who
came to this country from New Brunswick.
Short frocks arrived, and the demand for
smart stockings enabled big figures to be done
with the line of American silk hose that
Bond handle d.
Then the war shut
supplies off. It
was a question of
going under or
m a n u f a c taring
locally. Bond re-
solved he might as
well go under try-
ing, so he set about
raising capital
while Conover went
to America to buy
plant. He did tin-
job well, the enter-
prise flourished,
and he was handed
his marshal’s baton
in the shape of a
directorship.

If the S. Aus. Labor Government makes
Bert Edwards, M.P., its Agent-General, he
will be the first ex-bottle-oh to hold the job.
From mobilising empties, Bert pluekily
pushed on to a pieshop in the west end of
Adelaide, thence to a pub and later to a
better pub and Parliament.
At the opening of the Australian Drug
Co.’s new building in Wynyard-square, Syd-
ney, it was mentioned that the business was
founded by John Tawell, a Quaker, in 1820.
This was the way of it. Tawell, who had
been traveller for a drug firm in England,
was transported for being in possession of
a forged note. Macquarie assigned him as an
attendant at the General Hospital; and good
conduct won him his “ticket,” and later his
full freedom. His shop in Pitt-street was
such a fine one for those days that when he
sold out to Ambrose Foss he netted £14,000.
Foss in 1840 had a branch shop on the north
corner of Park and George streets; on his
death the firm became Foss, Son and Co., and
so continued until Edward Row bought the
business. Row's business eventually became
the Australian. Drug Co. Tawell's shop was
on the west side of Pitt-street, three doors
north of King-street; the Civic Club is
thereabouts now. Tawell’s reformation was
apparently not enduring; lie returned to Eng-
land, and was hanged in 1545 for poisoning
a woman.
“Uramao”-; The death of William David-
son, who pioneered M.E.’s frozen-meat indus-
try, recalls that the first shipment was made
by the N. 7. and A. L. Co. on Feb. 15, 1882,
from Port Chalmers by the ship Dunedin.
The freezing appa-
ratus went wrong
when 1500 car-
cases were aboard,
and they had to be
rushed off and sold.
It e p a i r s wore
effected, and the
second shipment
reached London in
fine condition. The
first shipment from
Auckland was by
the Mataura, on
May 26, 1883. The
first shipment by
the Dunedin was
slaughtered on the
Tot a r a estate,
North Otago, where
Tho s. Brydone,
Mr. Davidson’s col-
laborator in the
enterprise, has a
cairn erected to
his memory.

“Socius”: Victoria’s Labor Ministry has
a congenial Parliamentary draftsman in poet
Bernard O’Dowd, who was associated with
Prendergast, J. P. Jones, Tunnecliffe and
other veterans in the pioneering days of the
Labor movement. Bernard and J. B. Cas-
tioau (now assistant secretary to the Police
Commission) were the chief contributors to
the Tocsin, for which Norman and Lionel
Lindsay did a lot of work in their precocious
youth. In those days the poet was regarded
as the oracle of the little group, and his old
disciples are not likely to put on airs with
him now.
Built his last house, Robert Doig Sime,
after half a century of contracting in Syd-
ney. As president of the Master Builders
from 188 S to 1901, to him was due the sug-
gestion, made in a report to the Government
on technical education in N. S. Wales, that
attendance of apprentices should be made
compulsory at the Technical College, and
that the youths should be paid for the time
so occupied. A Scot of Dundee, he arrived
in Australia 64 years ago, and among other
buildings he, constructed the Sydney
Y.M.C.A. and Anthony Hordern’s. He was
84 when he went to join his wife, who had
died three weeks earlier.
John Nicholson, once the oldest civil ser-
vant in Australia, has died at 95. Arriving
in Australia in 1864, he settled in Brisbane,
lost his money, and was appointed first
C.P.S. at Mackay, then just coming into
prominence. Later he had the same job at
Bundaberg, Rockhampton and Townsville,
in 1900 he went to Brisbane, and retired in
1919 at four score and ten.
At 76 George Henry Ilebdon called it a day.
Finishing his education at Repton, in the Cold
Country, lie juggled figures for five years in
l Melbourne bank; then decided on the freer
spaces. For some years lie managed pastoral
properties for his father, afterwards setting
*’P r for himself on Erambie, in the Molong
(N.S.W.) country, where he specialised in
Suffolk Punch horses and Romney Marsh
sheep. The memory of this childless man
will live with the hundreds of returned sol-
diers he delighted to assist.
The cables gave a line the other day to
the death of Francis Barraud, an English
artist who painted a picture which is more
familiar to the modern world than any
masterpiece. The subject was a fox-terrier
regarding the innards of a gramophone horn.
After being hung in the Royal Academy
under the title of “His Master’s Voice,’ the
painting was purchased to become the trade-
mark of an enterprising gramophone co„ and
helped to make a fortune for the purchasers,
if not for the painter. Curiously enough, one
of Barraud’s last commissions was to paint
a miniature reproduction of the nicture for
a gramophone, 4in. high, which was part of
the furnishings of the Queen’s Doll House, at
Wembley.
When the Newport (Vic.) State school
was opened in its remodelled form the other
day, Mrs. S. G. Kohry, an old lady of 98,
was the guest of honor. Her husband took
charge 'when the first school was opened in
Newport in 1865. The old lady helped to
bring many old Newport citizens into the
world at a time when medical assistance was
scarce and a schoolmistress was expected
to do more things than instruct the young.
Gone to rest under the. blood-red rata he
did so much to protect, J. L. Bennett, for
many years custodian of Ivapiti Island,
M.L.’s beautiful bird and tree sanctuary.
He was a good hater, but reserved his hate
for the wild goats and cattle, descendants of
the herds kept by the old whalers, and for the
Maori sheepowners at the north end of the
island, descendants of Te Rauparaha’s war-
riors who came there in quest of the muskets
with w’hicli they almost exterminated the
population of the mainland. The rare visi-
tors to the island will remember Bennett for
his hospitality and camp-fire stories. He
had been a lonely man after his wife died on
the island a couple of years ago.
E. A. Chapman has been appointed acting-
secretary of the Australian Railway Union,
vice Buckley, of the Sliding Panels. Chap-
man, who has been in Australia just long
enough—seven months—to find his way to
the G.P.O. unattended, had been previously
in close co-operation with the French and
German syndicalist movement, served on a
delegation to Russia and was editor of
Solidarity, official organ of the English Shop
Stewards. Now through the exclusion of Aus-
tralians like Dan Glyne, associated with the
Railways all his life, and fired “for all time”
for his activities in the last strike, and others
who know the service backwards, Chapman
(86) joins up with the imported Willis, Bad-
deley and Tom Walsh to guide Australian
unionism.
“II.”: I nominate George Black, M.L.C.,
of the Ma State, for the Political Magnanim-
ity Stakes. The late Dan O’Connor fought
him three of the hardest fights of his Leg.
Assembly days, yet, when poor Dan’s weak-
nesses had told their tale, Black, then in the
Holman Labor Ministry, raised him a hand-
some subscription, and, later, when the old
man died, had a handsome monument placed
over him in Waverley Cemetery.
Ranembe (always called “Ran”) Morgan,
lately dead in Adelaide, was son of an old-
time S.A. Premier. Educated at Geelong
Grammar, he was one of the first students in
the S.A. Agricultural College at Roseworthy.
He was associated with the importation of
Shropshire sheep for Watalunga station by
Arthur Waterhouse, his brother-in-law, and
became a popular judge at Melbourne shows.
At the beginning of the century he for some
time had Strathgarvey station, near Warwick
(Q.). His surviving brother is an Adelaide
surgeon locally famous for never wearing a
hat.
C. J. Mcßae, president of the N.S.W. Pri-
mary Producers’ Union, who died suddenly
last week, of course wasn’t a primary pro-
ducer —hardly anybody who ever speaks for
the primary producer is. For most of his
life he was a country storekeeper, with a
business at Coraki; but he had the confidence
as well as the custom of the cockies of his

ernment made him an M.L.C. last year.
A brother is William Mcßae, formerly
head-office manager of the Bank of N. S.
Wales, and a probable general-manager but
for a piece of singularly bad luck.
A parson with a punch is James Watson,
of the Methodist mission in Carpentaria, who
refuses to believe there are any white women
held captive in his diocese. Owing to his
advocacy of the rights of Black Brother,
especially with regard to the condition of
the Government compound at Darwin, he has
always been a thorn in the side of Territory
officialdom; at the same time he maintains
that if he had received more backing from
the authorities during Darwin’s famous revo-
lution. Soviet control would have been
averted. His camp is at the head of the
long archipelago stretching down the west
horn of the Gulf, and as the blacks who
yearly migrate from the mainland in search
of fish and trepang have to use his island as
a stepping-stone, whatever information there
is about the alleged atrocity should come his
way. Still, his diocese has a frontage of
400 miles with an average depth of 200, and
quite a lot of things could happen in that
area without making themselves heard all
over it.
The rise in importance of another religious
denomination in Australia is denoted by the
arrival of Archbishop Christoforus Knetes
as official head of the Greek Orthodox Church
the Commonwealth. The cleric receives
his appointment from the Patriarch of Con-
stantinople ; and Oystopoulos and Pitchi-
ton: abandoned their oyster-sliops and fruit-
emporiums for one day last week to greet the
new prelate at the Greek Church, East Mel-
bourne. Melbourne is to be the II Q of the
new' dignity.
One of Labor’s oldest war-horses in Queens-
land is Bob Mulvey, re-elected Labor Coun-
cil sec. for the third time. He first showed
up as sec. of the Moulders’ Union, and held
that job for 22
years. For 16
years he was the

Another link between Napoleon and Aus-
tralia broke when Marmaduke Watson Lee
died at Qucanbeyan (N.S.W.) a few days
ago. Born in Surrey in 1858, he was the
fourth son of the late Colonel William Lee
at one time Governor of St. Helena. The
Colonel’s father was also associated with the
island, where he made the acquaintance of
Napoleon. The son. the father of the just
dead Lee, also know the Emperor, and owned
a collection of Napoleon relics. Marmaduke
came to Australia in 1877, and after jacke-
rooing on various stations, purchased Middle-
field, on the West Bogan. Later he added
Kidgibilli and lived there until a few years
ago.
F. A. Schmidt, an Imperial W. 0., with a
dozen years’ service in the Australian perma-
nent forces, was killed by a fall from a bolt-
ing horse at Liverpool (N.S.W.) on Friday.
He was one of the few in the A.I.F. with a
German accent, and his thunderous “Mit-out
trag-ropes, prepare to ad-wance !” caused some
slight derision amongst recruits in the early
days, —quickly silenced, incidentally, by the
man’s tremendous earnestness and force of
character. He landed at Gallipoli with the
hrst artillery unit, and was a favorite with
Birdwood for his gallantry and intimate
knowledge of the job. There was some ques-
tion about the advisability of sending him to
France, but he went and did admirable work.
A widow and five children, all good Austra-
lians, as he was, survive him.
Dead in London at 47, John Milne, son of
John and grandson of William, one of Adel-
aide’s leading citizens half a century hack.
A G. of E. clergyman, he was tutor to the
present English cricket captain when Lord
Tennyson was Governor of South Aus., and
he did good work for a time under Carr Smith
at St. .James’s Church, Sydney. Lately he
had toiled chiefly in the London slums.
A. cable the other day announced to a gen-
eration of Maorilanders who knew him not
the death in London of Edward Wakefield.
It is 40-odd years since the journalist-politi-
cian was in the spotlight in MIL. He was a
nephew of the great coloniser Edward Gib
b°n Wakefield, M.P. in the late ’seventies
and early ’eighties. Colonial Sec. and Native
Minister in the Atkinson Ministry during the
six days that Government sucked the sweets
of office, and footed the Inky Way on the
Nelson Examiner (dead), Wellington Press

Although Maitland has an Australian-born
ILC. bishop in I)r, Dwyer, the appointment
o. the new Vicar-General went to an Irish-
man, Patrick Roche, a Waterford man, born
60 years ago. This is the second Waterford
cleric to hold the job—Monsignor English,
the Vicar-General in 1895, was the first.
“0.P.H.”: If Prendergast is as economical
with words when he returns to the Opposi-
tion leadership (before Cup time) as he is
as Premier, it will be a great relief. When
he was on the left side of the Speaker his
tongue was so much his boss that he would
even read to the House the text of his ques-
tions printed on the notice paper. As Pre-
mier lie replied to a query by Lawson, on a
fairly important subjct, the other day, with
the one word “Yes,” and the gallery gasped
with delight at such condensation. If he
would only cut out of his speeches, “I desire
to point out, sir, in connection with this
matter,” the hopes of the scribes regarding
him would rise still higher.
THE BUMPS OF LOVE

“The science of phrenology would in the future
help to obviate the unhappy marriage. By a study
of her character as revealed by her head the young
man would avoid an alliance with an unsuitable life
partner.”
Belinda is the sweetest fay
That ever made a day seem bright;
Her face is fair, her spirit gay,
Her gentleness a rare delight.
Her footsteps set my blood astir,
And on my ribs my glad heart thumps ;
But yet 1 baulk at marrying her—
-1 am in doubt about her bumps.
Though all my senses are a-reel
When we are locked in fond embrace,
My fingers through her tresses steal
The outline of her skull to trace.
She thinks it is a fond caress,
Whilst I, with pulse that leaps and jumps,
- Am wondering if my nervousness
Will let me rightly read her bumps.
I do not like to tell her flat
That ere we wed I wish to read
The book she carries ’neath her hat,
And so I still delay the deed.
I doubt that it will e’er be done,
Since dark doubt keeps me in the dumps ;
Love’s course does never smoothly run,
And I am worried by the bumps.

ABORIGINALITIES

BARNES LINSEED OIL
“A.M.R.” (Now Hebrides) : Recently,
while visiting a local bush village, 1 saw a strange
procession which interested ine.
In the ;: lead was a recently-con-
verted heathen who held a packet,
tied to a long stick, far out in
front of him. Then followed a
native constable of the N.H.N.C.
in all the glory of his comic-opera
uniform; next came a trembling
youth of 18 or so, and then old
Hot Lomo, a local chief of some
influence —a repatriated Queens-
lander. All were badly scared.
The packet contained malekulau
.too (magic) belonging to a Tanna
man who had just died. Being
curious, 1 had a look in. inside
bamboo tubes were what looked
like dried entrails, a whitish pow-
der and some small stones. When
1 opened the gadget, the local
population faded discreetly into
the bush. The constable, by virtue
of his glorious but humorous uni-
form, was unable to run away,
but dodged behind a. tree and
from there kept up a monologue
of this kind: “Master, you no
open that feller. Something very
bad devil he stop. That one he
killum too many people. My word,
Master, you no capsize. Hey,
Master! My word”—etc., etc. 1
plugged up the tubes again and
let. it go at that. Times are hard
and copra is low, and I didn’t want
to fall foul of any devils. When
I said so-long to old Bot and his
friends, they didn’t like the idea
of shaking hands at all. Incident-
ally, I was ill with very bad mal-
aria just after, and this 1 am sure
i onfirmed the darkies’ opinion of
the power of this particular witch
dope, although it is not supposed to be able to
harm whites.
* * • •
“Canis”: On Monaro (N.S.W.) they are
telling the story of Snowy, a sheep-dog who this
winter put himself in the class that men write books
nd preach sermons about. Last summer, Walter
Weir, his owner, was employed at Currangorambla
vtatjpn, but when winter came he left for Blowering,
50 miles away, where he began work in the bush.
I'nfortunately, he cut. his foot with an axe, and was
taken to Tumut hospital, Snowy being left behind
at the camp. After howling almost continuously
for a week, the dog felt, he could stand it no longer
and started out after his boss. But he knew nothing
of Tumut hospital and supposed that Weir had gone
back to Currangorambla. Fresh snow, deep and soft,
obscured all tracks and made travelling arduous,
but Snowy trotted the distance between dusk and
daylight—a 50-mile journey, 30 miles of it through
n. continuous cushion of deep, fresh snow.
“Penn Chant”: The captain’s exhortation
impressed Hori. Joining the kneeling penitents he
awaited developments. When one of the lassies came
to wrestle with his soul, he asked: “Where you get
te path?” “The bath? 1 don’t understand you.”
“Py korry, you ton’t know I’’1 ’’ exclaimed the asto-
nished Maori. “Then what you sing wash me in
te prud of te ram for?”

“Barcoo”: Re “Alpha’s” horseman who
got his throat, gashed by the spur of the bridle-bit,
owing to his prad’s impatience (B. 14/8/’’24). In
the early ’eighties Salisbury, while in charge of 1000
steers from Lerida station (N.Q.), was missing one
morning, and the other stockmen, on making a search,
found his horse, and, a little further on, his body,
where he had bled to death owing to a stabbed jugular
vein. The . evidence—a pocket-knife, a stick of plug
tobacco and pipe, and the disturbed footprints
of his mount, just back from where the body was
found —all went to show that he had been filling his
pipe when something startled the horse and caused
it to plunge. In grabbing up the reins hurriedly,
while holding on to hi.; knife, the point of the blade
must have made contact with the jugular. The gash
was so large that the victim probably bled to death
in a few minutes.
* * * *
“Rufus II.”: All tlie recent Abo. egg yarns
have been knocked kite-high by a hen belonging to
J. Bedford, poultryman, of Moonstone Flat (Q.)
Recently he noticed one of his chooks with an
abnormal swelling, so decided to kill her for the
benefit of the others. Haying boiled the corpse he
opened it up and found inside one huge soft-shelled
egg which contained 12 fully-formed eggs each in
its own skin. The lot when cold weighed 220 z.
G. Dunsford, stationer, of Gill-street, Charters Towers,
can verify this. By-the-bye, Bedford has a most
peculiar vegetable growing in his garden—a young
silver wattle which has on the end of each fully-
formed leaf two tamarind leaves about two inches
long. He has both kinds of trees growing around
his place, and evidently the pollen of one inoculated
the other.
* * * *
“Cartot”: To my philological friend I
referred the query of “Tomb” (B. 14/8/’24) as to
whether the billygoat has a serious name, and he
informed me that, while there is no particular word
in use now, male goats were once known as “yedes.”
The word belongs to the Chaucerian period, and the
chances are that it has been out of use for some
centuries. Incidentally, there are a number of words
denoting the young of certain animals that are fast
becoming extinct. Who ever hears nowadays, for
instance, of yelts, leverets or elvers? Yet these
words, meaning respectively young sows, young

“.’Erbert” (Mild,lira, Vic.) : On July 21 I
found a pair of wedgetail eagle’s eggs, and the
young ones were almost ready for hatching. Is this
not remarkably early ? I always t hought eagles
nested very late, and left the hatching to the sun
during the daytime.

“Yarrum” : As I saw it. A married couple
of magpies were building a nest near the school, and
on the second day a hefty-looking male turned up
to lend a hand. The husband sat back to watch
operations; but he didn’t see all that was going
on, and when the nest was completed the volunteer
and the missus turned upon the loafer and chased
him off the premises. They pursued him to the
horizon, and then returned and lived and loved in
a shameless way. After a couple of days the discarded
hubby arrived upon the scene with a pug bird.
They gave the usurper a deuce of a trouncing and
left him just enough feathers to fly away with.
Then they tore the nest to pieces, and the little
wifey was left lamenting. The pug sneaked back,
and made overtures to her; but she wouldn’t even
listen. Then he kicked the nest about some more
and left. She sat around for a week, and then
must have wirelessed the co re., because he turned
up spick and span again, and they started a new
nest. The couple reared three, families in my time,
and, as far as I could judge, lived happily.
A. QUITE UNNECESSARY COMMODITY.
MOTHER (the son is packing his bag for a camp): “ Willie — why, you haven’t put in any
soap!”
WILLIE : “Soap? We’re going for a holiday.”
“Kapai” : I think a yonng sheep-dog in the
Waikato »(M.L.) must have put up something of a
record with her last batch of pups. In the morning
she had eight, and the owner told the handy-man to
keep two and drown the rest. Going out in the
afternoon he saw the box still full of pups, and
asked why they . had not been disposed of. The
man declared that he had already drowned six, and
a count revealed that in the interval the mother
had achieved nine more, bringing the total of the
litter up to 17.

“Pongo”: I have a valuable Pekinese dog
that is debarred from prizetaking through a habit
of carrying one hind leg off the ground, though
perfectly able to use it. I consulted a vet. whose
verdict was “pure laziness.” Then I asked a
friend’s advice, and he suggested tying up the other
hind leg; but the spectacle of Fluff progressing on
his two front legs doesn’t appeal to me, not being
in the circus line; so can the Council supply me
with a cure?
• * • •
“Two Seas”: There is little doubt that
“Tough Mike’s” cattle (B. 21/8/’24) are affected
by pink-eye. All sorts of remedies for it have been
suggested, from alum to turpentine, nearly all of
them horribly cruel. (If any Abo. doubts it, let
him try them on his own eyes.) I have cured hun-
dreds of sheep and a few station milkers quite
painlessly, and in the interests, of the animals, and
for the information of turpentine fiends especially,
here is the recipe. Take a pinch of boracic-acid
powder between the thumb and forefinger of the right
hand, draw the lower eyelid out with the thumb and
forefinger of the left hand and drop the powder in.
It will cure sheep that are practically blind.
“Lily-Bealo”; “.Tacky Roo” (B. 24/7/’24) says that
with pink-eye in sheep the eye invariably turns
blue. He is evidently mistaken in the disease, for
if the jumbucks contract pink-eye the eyeball turns
up into the head, leaving a bright pink film showing.
In the case I mentioned, brown sugar was applied,
but it proved effective in only a comparatively small
number of cases. A much more effective remedy
(temporary) is kerosene; but well-known sheepmen
and stock inspectors declare there is no known per-
manent cure. The best thing to do with the afflicted
jumbucks is, if possible, to turn them into mutton.
• • * •
“Ciirisbrook .Tun.” : To settle an argu-
ment, can any Abo. tell me how far north mutton-
birds have been seen? I’ve been all over North Aus-
tralia, but have seen none further up than Willis
Island (east of Cairns), where there’s still a goodly
number.
* * * *
“Rufus IT.”: I struck something new in
the way of starting a jibbing horse recently. I
had been asked by a neighboring Chow gardener to
do some ploughing, he supplying the horse. When
the moke was yoked up I tried to start him, but
couldn’t get a budge out of him with either word
or waddy, and was giving the job up in disgust
when Ah Plonk had an inspiration. He ran up
to the humpy and presently returned with the horse’s
bell. He put this on and at the first “Gee up”
away went Baldy. The prad always had a bell on
in the paddock, so 1 suppose he considered himself
undressed without it.
* * * *
“Buloe”: Notwithstanding “Oolub” (B.
7/’2/’24), snakes are not immune to their own
poison. Two cases in point. No. I—A1 —A large black
wriggler (red underneath) crawled under the roots
of a fallen tree, and, as f could not hit him with
a stick, I made a long spear point and stabbed him
with it, whereupon the snake bit himself savagely. I
waited, and a little later he crawled out, lay in a
straight line and died. No. 2—l crippled a black
snake (blue underneath) with a stick, and made it
bite itself. In 20 minutes it was dead and lying
in a perfectly straight line. Incidentally, l have
killed, and have seen killed, a large number of snakes,
but not one of them died in the same way as these
two that had bitten themselves.
A FAR MORE IMPORT AFT JOB.
"You're mad! Horn d' you expert to catch
fish in a pond like this?"
“Who said anything about fishing? I’m
cooling a couple o’ bottles.”
•‘Pick”: At Enfield (N.S.W.) the other
day a marauding tyke killed the mother of a two-
days-old chicken clutch. The youngsters were col-
lected into a box for the night, but next morning
had gone. They were found afield in charge of a
diminutive bantam cockerel. He apparently had
recognised - that the little fellows had been deprived
of their worm-winner, and had voluntarily taken on
the job of foster-parent —and he has faithfully carried
on ever since, no scratches assiduously, calls for
the brood in a comically-affected clucking falsetto,
jealously guards them against all intruders, and,
though himself too small to cover the lot effectually,
does his best at sheltering them.

They leave the homes their fathers reared with pride
On paven avenues of light and laughter;
They leave the glowing hearths where side by side
Men die in deep content ’neath roof and rafter.
They rest and roam beneath the open sky
Beyond the street whose tide is swift and tragic;
They seek the purple ranges far and high
In careless days of magic.
Not always are their tracks beset with woe
Through scrublands dense, forsaken wildernesses;
The cadence of a freeman’s march they know,
Rare fragranse when the mountain breeze caresses.
For them the Spring holds wonder rarer far
Than that conceived where home’s grey walls en-
cumber ;
More lustrous glows the white and watching star
On spaces where they slumber.
More radiant is the sunlight on the downs
That greets them in the young September morning,
Plying between the happy pastoral towns,
Heeding the magpies’ song that holds no scorning
For road and river-bank and leafy lane,
What time contented herds and flocks are feeding
Deep in the lush abundance of the plain,
The march of man unheeding.
By harrowed uplands in the South and West
They wander when the grain is ripe for reaping.
The harvest, morn in amber glory drest,
('aim eve when shadows down the slopes are creeping
Oft see them up the beaten pathways stride,
Choired onward by the lark’s full-pitched elation,
No goal to win across the spaces wide,
No certain destination.

ESSEX
A SIX
Built by Hudson under Hudson Patents
Has Advantages of Both
Hudson and the Former Essex
The new Essex “Six” is built by Hudson, the sixth largest motor car
manufacturer in the world —and for the past nine years the largest
producer of high quality cars. The very features which have raised
Hudson to such a leading position are now incorporated in the new
Essex. It has the same advantages of long life, reliability and
smooth performance.
The remarkable economy, low maintenance cost and sturdy endur-
ance which won over so many to the former Essex are all retained
and improved upon in the new Essex.
There is greater economy in fuel, oil and tires; greater accessibility
for replacements and repairs. Parts prices are lower, which means
less maintenance expense.
And to these outstanding advantages is added a lower first cost than
the Essex has ever before sold for. Both the open touring model and
the Coach with its closed car comforts offer a value unequalled
in this price field.

“S.E.M.” : The peewit and magpie are not
the only birds which pal up with human beings (B.
12/6/’24). Last year in May a little grey thrush
came and picked up crumbs in my back yard. When-
ever the crumbs were short, it would whistle one
deep, sweet note and upon a piece of bread being
thrown out it would take the morsel and fly off. Before
the winter was over the thrush had confidence enough
in the four children and myself to come into
the kitchen and pick crumbs off the floor. It arrived
again this year, and from the first has come inside
THE PENALTY OF POLITENESS.

’it yer?”
PETER: “Ow! Ow-wow! Sh-sh-she asked me if —
if —if I'd ’ave some bread an’ nunny, an’

to get its meals. When the grubs were bad in
the tomatoes last year, the thrush hopped among
the vines while I was busy killing the pests and
caught almost as many as I did, thus rewarding
me for feeding him through the winter months. Also
at my dad’s place are three wild butcher-birds which
come regularly to be fed. They all enter the
dining-room, and one will perch on a chair or the
table and take titbits out of father’s hand.
“Jcobb”: The donkey team lias invaded
the north of the Territory and lias come to stay.
For years Bert Drew and Tom Brumby have done
all the carting from the Victoria River depot to
the western stations with the game little chaps, and
a team of 50, four abreast,
with their 10- and 12-ton loads
doing ther 10 to 15 miles a
day for the 600-mile trip, is a
sight worth seeing. That daily
mileage might sound slow to
city ears, but they average
better than a horse team, and
are far easier to muster of a
morning than a Ford car. At
the Katherine there are about
200 of these little balls of
muscle, split up into four or
five teams, and they are mostly
used for carting bore materials
to the tablelands. They are
doing the work so well that on
a recent occasion, starting at
the same time as the horse
teams, they were back from
the 300-mile trip and loaded
again before the horses had de-
livered their goods. But there
is a fly in the ointment at the
Katherine —not, so far as we
know, elsewhere. That is, 90
per cent, of the progeny have
to be shot on account of de-
formity at birth or within a
few weeks. Some nave the
most weird-shaped legs —in
many cases all four are twisted,
in others the rear legs are
affected, in some odd instances
the trouble is in one leg only.
They are twisted and warped
cither from the knees or the
brisket, and in odd cases from
the fetlock only. Many are the
reasons given by the “ringers’’
in discussing the matter over
the fires of a night—some say
inbreeding, others wet soil, and
the rocky country and the lime-
stone also come in for their
share of the blame. The in-
breeding is discounted by the
introduction of a new Jack
from the south; and rocks,
limestone and wet soil as rea-
sons, I won’t have, as the coun-
try around Grove Hill, 100
miles away, is similar and a
good deal wetter, yet there
have been donkeys there for
over 30 years. Certainly they are more or less
brumbies, but I have, in 14 years among them, seen
only cne deformed animal, and that deformity could
easily have been the result of an accident. Let some
of the. Donkaboites solve the problem.

“Borom”: Though it will probably be
some time yet before electroculture of crops and
plants is applied on a commercial scale, there may
be something in it in another direction. In a N.S.W.
vineyard a while back there were tried some experi-
ments with regard to the stimulation of the growth
of young vines by means of an electric current applied
to the vine directly. The results showed
that, though there was an increase in
both size and rate of growth, it was not
very considerable; but more important
from the vigneron’s point of view was
the discovery that the treated vines were
subsequently free from the scales and
• afflictions which frequently attack the
grape-plant, and from which others in
the same vineyard were suffering. Prob-
ably it was not so mucli that the current
killed the deleterious organisms and
moulds, but that it bestowed upon the
plants a greater resistance and enabled
them to overthrow the afflictions by them-
selves. If it should prove possible to
immunise vines to phylloxera in this way,
the process will be of much greater value
than if it merely stimulated growth.

“Te Babarantiko”: “Ngatik”
himself slips when he asserts (B. 14/8/’24)
that Gilbert Islanders use neither rudder
nor paddle for steering their fast-sailir.g
canoes (tua). from a steamer’s deck it
may look as “Ngatik” says to the uniniti-
ated spectator. I have had a good deal
to do with Gilbert Islands canoes, but I
know of no instance in which the steering-
paddle didn’t hang by its grummet of
tokoro coir-twine in the steering cleat. To
’bout ship the islanders bring the sail into
the wind, and, while supporting the sail,
dip its gaff-and-boom tack around the mast
and to the other end of the craft, while
the steering paddle is shifted to the cleat
in the end of the canoe which previously
was the stern. Anyway, the tendency of
these outrigger canoes instantaneously to
leap to the wind even when the boom of
the triangular sail is slacked out forbids
steering by sail manipulation alone; just as
does the single rope guy from the outrigger trestle
which supports the loose sail and mast, the latter
being merely stepped in a deck shoe or socket.
* * * *
“Cartot”: If there is anything in “To
Pana’s” remarks concerning the lack of navigating
ability in the early Maoris (B. 21/8/’24), they cer-
tainly do not apply to the other peoples of the
Pacific, with whom the Maoris are kin, or have been
associated in some way. The natives of several
groups have a fairly accurate knowledge of naviga-
tion by means of stars, and in one or two islands
this knowledge is safeguarded for future generations
THE GENTLE REMINDER.
MR. LEWIS: “My dear, I wish you wouldn’t hum that
song about ‘Falling Dew.' ”
MRS. LEWIS: “Why not
MR. LEWIS: “It reminds me of — of —of so many things."
by being set in poetical form, the poems being handed
don'n from one generation to another. Strange to
say, although the contents of these poems are crude,
they still bear traces of having descended from some
long-forgotten system of a highly scientific and com-
plex nature, and in one or two places seem to be
connected with the astronomical systems of early
South America, which is additional evidence in sup-
port of the belief that South America was originally
peopled by immigrants from Asia, who crossed the
Pacific and established the now long-dead civilisations
of that part of America, giving off as they went sub-
sidiary streams of migration which later peopled some
of the groups of the ocean. Probably the Maoris,
among others, are descended from one of these
streams.
* * » *
“Lily-Beale”: A goat owned by J. Drew,
of Gilgandra (N.S.W.), recently brought into the
world seven kids, all alive and healthy, although
rather smaller than usual. Last year the same Nanny
had four kids, but two of them were so deformed that
they were put out of misery with a friendly waddy.
* * * *
“P.C.M.” : An eagle-hawk’s nest was found
recently on Kensington Downs ((}.), in which were
two young birds, just hatched. The following supply
of food had been gathered by the parents and left in
the nest, to satisfy the modest appetites of the
youngsters: Three lambs, one small wild pig, :onc
fair-sized cat and one small wild turkey. All the
food was quite fresh.
* * * *
“8.5. A.”: Dingoes have something of a
reputation for hearing and scent, yet an Adelaide
man, A. W. Cocks, says he had an abo. tracker
working for him at Wilgena station (S.A.) who in
summer time used to track a dog for miles over all
kinds of stony country, and, creeping up, spear him
while resting in the shade.
* * * *
“Bill R.”: The full-blooded Australian
aborigine is not always the indolent, lazy won’t-
worker he is said to be. During my sojourn at
Wallaga (N.S.W.) one dusky resident, Old Walker,
had a bullock team with which he did much carry-
ing between the port at Bermagui and the inland
settlements. Sam Haddigaddi, another Wallagan, was
the neatest and fastest ploughman that toiled for
the Tilba Tilba dairy silos. Mumbla was a bark-
stripper who held his own at that occupation with
the best whitefellow guns. Jack Bond was a
quarryman and an untiring all-round grafter. Old
Zacharia constantly carved out spears and boomerangs
for sale to curio-hunters. Dick Piety was charcoal-
burner for many South Coast farriers. Davy Blair
was sanitary man for the near-by villages, and
there were others earning good wages as fishers
and oystermen.
* * * *
“Gouger”: Some nigger tribes in Cape
York Peninsula have a primitive method of quaran-
tine. The Chinese introduced them to leprosy and
small-pox, and the whites and Japs are debited with
bringing venereal disease to these shores, although
the Malays may have a claim, too—trepang proas
were visiting the Gulf country hundreds of years
ago. The niggers build a circular fence of brush-
wood outside their camp; in this infected ones ara
segregated as soon as it is clear that they are in
the last stages of disease. Scraps of food are thrown
over to them at morning and sundown. 1 have never
heard of one of the condemned breaking away after
having passed into the compound of death; they
just await the inevitable end.
* * * *
“Notesoeg”: Landing recently on one of
the smaller uninhabited islands oiF the northern end
of the Barrier Reef, 1 found the beach literally
covered with young pearl-oyster shells. They were
all from -Jin. to lin. across and had evidently been
there only 48 hours or so —the smell fixed the time.
As they were in hundreds of thousands, will the
Council please explain?
* * * *
“Sarah” : A neighbor of mine had a couple
of acres of lucerne which he had not looked at for a
while. Going to mow it the other day he found the
lucerne had hardly a leaf on it. Thinking of cater-
pillars he made an examination and could find no
trace of them, but there was evidence that led him
to complain to neighbors about their ducks and
geese. Not being' able to sheet the marauding home,
he kept watch, and shortly after dark heard a
whirring of wings as a flock of birds settled on
the lucerne patch. Rushing in among them he fired
both barrels of his shotgun at once, and, although
it was very dark, brought down half a dozen fine
fat wild ducks.
* * * *
“(longer” : The cow-farmers clown Ulmarra
way (Lower Clarence, N.S.W.) are interested in a
cow whose earmark is the point of the ear snipped
off. She has had three calves, and each was born
with the point of an ear missing. The same locality
boasts a calf born with its mother’s brand plainly
upon it as birthmark. If the Ulmarra cockics can
continue to breed beasts to type, then their worries
so far as branding is concerned will be over. Which
opens up another line of thought: How will the
cattle-duffers get rid of the brands of the future?
“Te Pana”: On Niua Toputapu, in the
Tongan Group, is the quaintest drinking-fountain
I’ve struck in a thirsty lifetime. This is the “suck-
ing rock,’’ a flat stone six inches below the surface
of the ground, close to a brackish lagoon. Chip the
face of the rock, apply’ the lips, and a flow of
sweet, cool water results.
“Capta” (Tas.) : I nominate swamp-gum
for durability and quickness of growth—3o years
from planting one can have trees 100 ft. high with a
little luck. I have seen 20ft. of growth in four
years. Of course it all depends on the soil. A good
heavy' loam, with a clay bottom, well watered, is the
best. Swamp-gum is not very prone to disease or
heart-rot. I have 200 acres of these trees as fine-
looking as it is possible to get, and while it may
not be the best timber in Australia, it is by no
means the worst.
“Wessel” : Maybe there is a hint for paw-
paw fanciers in W. G. White’s book on the Mawken,
the sea gypsies who wander round the islands oli
the extreme southern end of the coast of Burma.
He says that they cut the pawpaws up and sun-dry
them on the top of their boat hatches, and as a
result the fruit keeps for a long while.
* * * *
“Greenpea” : Do birds and animals imitat"
the habits of one another? 1 saw a sandiark
apparently trying to copy a marten the other day.
“HANG TO HIM, TIGER! DON’T LET
HIM BLUFF YOU."
It would fly up about 10ft. and then fold its wings
tightly to its sides, dropping almost to the ground
before opening them again. Its body was practi-
cally parallel with the ground while dropping,
quite unlike the usual sandlark method of coming
to ground, which is head first.
THE WHEELS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Start away on any journey
And you’re almost sure to find—
Obligation, love or money—■
There’s some debt you’ve left behind ;
Something that you haven’t settled
Frets and worries you within,
And the wheels below divine,
For they straightaway begin:
“Write a letter! Write a letter!”
As the gleaming rails are fleeting,
Kike a pulse of Babel beating
They’re repeating and repeating;
“Yes, a letter! Yes, a letter!
Yes, a letter, letter, letter!”
All the scenery is blighted;
’Tis no use to try to read,
For the chorus waxes louder
As the flying miles recede:
“Oh, you'd better write a letter!
Yes, a letter, write a putter!”
And the loud, incessant din
Aggravates the haunting worry
That distresses you within.
“Write a letter ! Yes, a letter !”
Oh, the weariness you feel
As the pestering, infernal,
insupportable, eternal,
Gabbling echoes clash and peal 1
How they cackle, wheel to wheel,
“What, a letter? Yes, a letter.
’Twould be better! Oh, yes, better—
Oh, much better ! Oh yes, better —
Write a letter, letter, letter.”
Every nut and bolt is talking,
All the lights are glaring eyes,
And each tunnel, hoarse, accusing,
Bellows at you as it flies:
“Burr-rr-rwp! A letter!”
“Burr-rr -umph ! You’d better!”
Clamoring, ’tis left behind,
But its echo still pursues you,
And the wheels, like fiendish frogs
Croaking in unearthly marshes
Where your aching spirit bogs,
Clack and clack about the letter
That you’d better, yes, you’d better....
And the wind, insistent, hisses
As it fidgets at the pane;
While the fittings sway and strain;
Every creak and clang and rattle
Finds a jarring tongue to prattle,
Prattle, prattle of that letter
That you’d better, better, better....
And the wheels come in again:
“Write a letter ! Write a letter !
Write a....” Oh, you breathe a prayer
As the chorus, breaking, quavers,
Faints and stops. Thank God, you’re there!

"c Approbation from Sir Hubert Stanley is praise indeed”
This phrase from the play of" Speed the Plough” serves
to remind us that the bestower of praise, whether by act
or word, is the real measure of the quality and worth of
that praise. A eulogy is only as great as its author—
neither more nor less. When sincere, it is the true reflec-
tion of his own mind first, of his wisdom, next of his
knowledge, finally of his judgment.
Had some other public or official body bought 19 New
Beale Pianos, the act would have been sufficiently note-
worthy and gratifying enough as a distinct mark of
practical approval. But when it is the New South Wales
Conservatorium—the unchallenged arbiter in our world
of music—which makes the choice, the honor is supreme
and the tribute unexcelled. It is an act of investiture —the
conferment of a distinction as enviable as it is complete.
The members of the Conservatorium Selection Com-
mittee—which stands in relation to Music as do the
Universities to Law and Medicine and Science—are
men skilled in their art, of ripe judgment and large tech-
nical knowledge. They analyse with patient care, con-
sider impartially and declare with firmness and finality.
They are not to be swayed by prejudice nor tricked by
the hazard of an impulsive choice. They concentrate on
such problems a calm and dispassionate attention, con-
scious that their verdicts will be evidentiary both of their
judicial minds and of the faithful discharge of their obli-
gations. They recognise that the effects of their choice
will be life-long.
The absolute importance of pianos of the highest class in a
Conservatorium, not alone for the great public performers but
also for the students, is unquestioned. Only the best can be
adequate for so delicate a training both of hand and ear. So
that it is really a matter of conscience for the governing body.
They must procure the best available.
The two qualities that are paramount in deciding the merits of
a piano are present quality and durability the ability to en-
dure and to remain good for a long period. The New Beale is
beautiful, and beauty is especially desirable in a piano. But the
prime requirement is its intrinsic merit as a musical instrument.
That, and the extent of its endurance are the determining
factors in a cautious appraisal.
List for yourself the attributes you would seek in a piano ! A
clear, pearling treble; a rich sonorous bass ; brilliance, respon-
siveness, a sweet and singing tone ! You will find, also, that
ineffable "something” which constitutes the individuality—-the
soul, as it were —of a fine piano ; the indefinable"something”
imparted by the magicianly touch which only the loving inter-
est of a proud and gifted craftsman can apply. It was such a
"something” that the old armourers of Damascus and Toledo
imparted to their blades which made them different from all
others in the world.
The Beale Pianos and Player-Pianos are made in several sizes at several prices, and are sold on an extended paymen-t
plan that brings them ‘within the reach of the most modest income. Liberal 'valuations made on used instruments
which are accepted as partial exchange. Write or call for copy of catalogue and other descriptive literature.

There was nothing of the wild flapper jazz
about the Mayoral Bruntons’ Civic Ball,
which shone with pre-war brilliance. Fairy-
land above and the Australian bush below
fho balcony line ; furlongs of pink roses en-
twined with codored lights blotting out tin;
ceiling; pictures of native birds, cunningly
framed with amber light bulbs on the bal-
cony frontages, and trellisings of wattle
flowers —this was the decorative scheme de-
vised by Charlie Coleman, junior. A ton-
load of golden fragrance scented the room
from the balcony pillars, and the organ plat-
form had been shut off to make way for a
bush scene real enough to have brought
throbs to the heart of a ’wayback pilgrim
marooned in the city. The revival of mili-
tary scarlet intensified the general dazzle.
Our demi-semi-Lieut.-Governor, Acting-Chief
Justice Cussen, with his dame and
daughter Alice, was God-saved to the parlor
end of the hall under convoy of his civic host
and hostess, the Mayor’s lady featuring an
expensive simplicity so misleading to the
unlearned in dress. Narrow lines of crystal
headings trickled discreetly down georgette,
veiling inky satin, to a silver sidOKirnament;
and a green orchid trembled in the heart
of a little hand posy. Pastel-colored gift
flowers brightened the black elegance of the
Oussen dame’s frocking. The fragile attrac-
tiveness of General Chauvel’s wife rose from
a sea of blue chiffon, foamed with opalescent
beads. Valerie Hall-Thompson, who came
with her admiral dad as understudy for
mother, supported silk embroidered white
with fringed edges, to which an expensive
shawl had obviously been sacrificed. Mrs.
Norton Grimwade gorgeously splashed pale
purple and gold, tasselled on one side. Supper
was spread for the official group in the old
Council Chamber; the lesser guests were re-
freshed in the big upstair room, and oysters
and porter flowed unceasingly in improvised
saloons. The hall was crowded, but there
was no undue crushing. Marjorie Shannon
and Gwen Carnegie, the only debs., came
up for presentation with ex-Mayoress
Weedon, the matron clad in becoming lilac
hangings and the small craft sporting sophis-
ticated frockings of silvery fabric.
The W.T. .T. Clarke pair brought son Trevor,
the lady looking imposing but a little less
like Queen Mary than of old, in misty black
and diamonds. The political Wilsons and
Lemmons were with the official group.
Knights Garran, James Barrett and Tom
Lyle were complete with their feminine
halves; Knight Cuscaden brought two
daughters and son-in-law T. Derham; Town
Clerk McCall was helpfully busy, and every-
body voted the shivoo the very best. Bald-
heads whom a 30-seconds’ waltz would have
winded in the old days tottered through a
whole dance programme with the same busi-
ness-like solemnity as their grandsons. The
group missing from the dance-boards were
die between-age men : perhaps they are suffer-
ing from an earlier surfeit of jazz. Quite a
lot of greyhaired women are acquiring the
Blues steps to keep pace with their giddier
husbands: and of course every woman of
every age one-steps. After all. fox-trotting, the
Blues and one-step are only variants, which
come easily to people with a sense of
rhythm; whereas the waltz, polka and
Washington Post of our forefathers were not
only strenuous but quite distinct movements.
Judging by the ’Varsity Con. students'
operatic show in the Melba Hall, the ancient
seat of learning may be relied on to supply
any world-shortage which may occur in
sopranos and tenors. The Con. has three
likely winners in Violet Jackson, Victor
Baxter and the 18-year-old Myrtle Wise.
.Musical experts from rival voice-factories
flocked to hear and helped to swell the
volumes of applause levelled at the budding
stars. The well-presented productions
opened with two scenes from “Lohengrin,”
act three. Violet Jackson, whose voice has the
breadth and purity for heroine Fisa, revealed
a flair for stage-work, and looked charming.
Victor Baxter, who has a tenor voice of
extraordinary volume, put up a fine perform
ance as the silver-armored Lohengrin. The
continuous open note must have proved a
strain after the bel canto of the Italian
school, but the voice came out richly, only
flattening a trifle when the violins offered
more than a suggestion of disagreement in
pitch. Myrtle Wise gave a distinguished ren-
dering of the “Romance and Shadow” dance
from “Dinorah.” Her coloratura work is
striking, and F in alt has no terrors for her
flexible voice.
S'obell’s pupils invariably let you into
the secret of what they are saying
or trying to say in song. “Carmen" was
well done, but Eugenie Scott lacked the
needed diablerie in the name-part. Wu-
liam Cadzow aired a tine voice as Don .lose,
and Charles Creighton sang the Toreadors
Song with spirit. Roma Philips and Gladys
Clarke put in some charming touches as the
two dancing-girls. The Con. orchestra called
for three cheers, although the violins slumped
more than once. De Gilio conducted, Sutton
Crow looked after the chorus work. Soboll
liad prepared the two first opera items, and
Agnes Janson the “Carmen” act.
The Women’s Automobile Club, having out-
grown its Anzac House quarters, is finding
more turning-room nearer the hub of the
city. On Thursday afternoon club president
Mrs. H. ,T. Robertson, breathing Paris from
every fold of her navy-braided silk, prefaced
the approaching trek with a musical tea-
drinking. Topped by a brown hat gladdened
with wallflower colorings, the hostess smiled
her welcomes with a joyous backing of
Spring flowers. Cecil Parkes fiddled, the
biggest plum in the musical pie; and James
Foran, whose tenor is beginning to get itself
talked about, was the star songbird—Sobcll,
chief voice specialist at the ’Varsity Con.,
came with his brown-eyed wife specially to
hear him. Included in the gathering were
Mrs. C. M. Reid, Mrs. Weyman Reid, Mrs.
J. Ilidgcock, Mrs. Quinnell, ex-Mayoress
Stein, Mrs. Springthorpe, Mrs. Felix Lloyd
and Mrs. T. Lambert. And Esme Allee,
just recovering from a tumble in the hunting
field, seized the chance to farewell her sister-
clubbites before crossing to Sydney for a
tonic of sunshine.
The Victoria League Ball, which last year
was a Cup season fixture, will next year be
included in the March Polo Week thrills.
The Cup carnival is so overloaded with
events that the League could find no blank
date. Priminister Bruce’s wife will preside
over the committee which is to engineer the
thing, while the Edward Miller and Maudsley
dames and Mrs. Hall Thompson will do their
bits as vice-presidents. The foundation-stone
of the swish affair will be laid in October at
the Bruces’ South Yarra home.
His Majesty’s let loose a tempest of en-
thusiasm upon “Andrea Chenier” on Saturday
night. But although the Best Known had
turned up in shoals few jewelled decorations
dressed their heads. Perhaps we may have
a revival of glitter for the Limbless Soldiers’
night. Perish the thought that we should
disgorge from ten pounds to two hundred a
seat without offering outward evidence of
being able to afford it! The audience filing
out on Saturday enthused over the stage
dressings and the charm of Scavizzi, but
deplored the loudness of the orchestra, which
again and again crowded out the singers’
voices. Toti dal Monte’s brown orbs beamed
at her working partners from a stage box:
below her the Norton Grimwades were
penned with the Geoff Syme and Askin
Foster matrons, the Jack Taits facing them.
Tom Brentnall looked after a party in the
circle, and Edwin Jowett shepherded a rival
contingent on the downstairs floor, where
Mrs. George Chirnside also sat with a party.
Meet Mrs. -T. J. Bren an, one of Mel-
bourne’s best-liked charitable workers, pic-
tured here by Humphrey. She has been for
30 years on
the committee
of the Wo-
men’s Hospi-
tal, is a mem-
ber of the
executive of
the Fairfield
Hospital for
Infectious Dis-
eases, and is
one of the
Linen Chest
League co n-
nected with
St. Vincent’s.
And these are
only three
spokes in the
c h a ri t able
wheel to
which she puts
her capable
shoulders. The
matron is the
widow of »ie late City Alderman Brenan,
and her big family includes the popular
Jennie Brenan who. with sister Eileen, has
laid the foundation of dancing successes for
many of our stage stars. Although an Aus-
tralian by adoption, Mrs. Brenan was born
and reared in Edinboro’ touu. Her husband
was likewise a Celt, but lie hailed from
Ould Oireland —the Kilkenny corner of it.
Nearly £BO will go into the Blind Institute
sick fund from a second rechauffe of the
Egyptian revue which previously did its bit
for the Alfred Hospital appeal. It was
organised by Mrs. James Angus, compiled
by a bunch of brisk medical students, and
musically directed by Olive Haines. The
re-dishing took place at the Prahran Town
Hall, where it whirled breathlessly from rag-
time to grand opera, and passed fiercely from
well-acted drama to burlesque. At half-time
the Institute sec., Hedger, handed a crystal
bowl spilling over with blossoms to Mrs.
Angus, with three hearty cheers from his
committee.
When Betty Niehol, of Clunes, said she
would to Lionel Grimwade at South Yarra
Christ Church the other day, she did it in
an ivory-rich lace veil lent by the ’groom’s
mother (Mrs. Norton Grimwade), frothed
over dazzling silver and gold. Yards of glit-
tering train were steered down the aisle by
a brace of engaging infants, Foster Grim-
wide and Pat McCaughey—the girleen a
fluff of white georgette with poke bonnet
and silk coatee, and the boy sleek in snowy
satin pantalettes fixed to a filmy shirt.
Green orchids broke the whiteness of the
bridal posy, and orange flowers perched be-
hind one ear. Sister Peggy and Quentin
Winter Irving ’maided in billowy waves of
georgette of a yellowish tint under modern-
ised coalscuttle ijjonnets supporting wall-
flower-colored streamers fastened to the brim
with golden-brown roses. They carried posies
of pansies of the same shade. W. H. Benson
dashed down from Albury to look after the
’groom, with the help of Max Armstrong,
and Robert Niehol led his sister to the sacri-
fice. After the Yoice had Breathed. Miss
Ada Ilattam, bride Betty’s aunt, had a
jollo at the Russell Grimwades’ Toorak place.
She was in black silk, and the bridegroom’s
mother trailed black crepe inlaid with dull
gold roses and topped off with a vivid pink
hat sporting a side feather. A miniature
battleship rode at anchor on the wedding-
cake as a reminder that the bridegroom had
put in several years as a naval officer. After
a Sydney honeymoon the newly-weds will
settle at Berwick, where Norton Grimwade
recently acquired the late Dick Grice’s
homestead.
A crowd .of the musical intelligentsia
were beckoned into the Aeolian Hall on Fri-
day to lend one ear to Percy Grainger and
the other to the Duo Art piano. One of the
unseen per-
formers was
composer
Cyril Scott in
a duet with
Percy, who
supplied the
dynamics for
both ; another
was the pian-
ist’s dead
mother. Fol-
lowing some
charming com-
positions of
Grieg, the
A u s t r alian
composer con-
cluded with
the delightful
Cradle song
(Brahms) and
his own
spirited “Gum
S u c k e r s'
March” : all numbers were prefaced with a
briefly-worded explanation as to what they
were about. The Grainger voice being as
musical as the fingers, the talk was nearly
as pleasing as the solos, and one felt it
more of this sort of intimate recital was
given here our concert halls would be better
filled. Few expected to find so much charm
in Grainger as a speaker. It all lies, how-
ever, in that simple and sincere directness
which distinguishes also his playing. The
portrait of him herewith is by May Moore,
of Sydney.
Sheelah Newman kept an important date
with the medical Tate Sutherlands’ son
Roderick at the Sacred Heart Church, St.
Ivilda, the other night. Her adoring dad
led her to the tryst, sister Lorna, Alice
Cussen and Doris Newman cheered her ou
the way, while J. Mcßean, Trevor Old-
ham and Marsh Renou did their united bit
for the bridegroom. Misted in white geor-
gette, carrying a crystal glitter under an
upper clouding of tulle veiling, little Sheelah
looked like a dew-splashed snowdrop. A
triolet of orange blossom bands encircled
her pretty head, and pale yellow roses
glowed amid the whiteness of her bridal
flowers. The trio of ’maids frothed ivory
lace and georgette entanglements over butter-
cup sheaths, and they sported gold head
bandages from which streamers fluttered.
The Gerald Newmans held the after-celebra-
tion in No. 9 Darling-street. Mrs. Gerald
and Mrs. Tate Sutherland both struck a
black note, though the latter relieved it with
a snowy silken shawl. The Cussen lady was
there with her Acting-Chief Justice, .and a
big medical contingent helped to make up a
cheery crowd.
The Atlee Hunts’ son Bruce has paired
with Maedhail Harper, the only daugh-
ter of Henry Harper and his wife,
who passed out early this year with-
in a few days of each other. Maedhail is
thus a grand-daughter of the late Robert
Harper, and a great-grand-daughter of the
late Dr. Cairns. She is a brainy damsel
ar.d is at the moment an undergrad.
Alderman Frank Stapley, once Mayor of
Melbourne, who was widowered last year,
has made a little commotion by quietly
marrying a widow lady, Mrs. Simms. Their
secret only leaked out while the newly-weds
were honeymooning at an Olinda resort.
The alderman, who earns his crust as an
architect, was made chairman of the Town
Planning Commission last year. There is
a baronetcy in the family, and he may get
it if he lives long enough.
Alec Russell stirred the golf pool to its
depths by winning the open championship
from the New South Welshman, Carnegie
Clark, at a phenomenal speed. The new
champ, is son and heir of the Philip Rus-
sells, of Mahw’allok, and nephew of Senator
Frank Guthrie; but although he comes of a
dynasty of squattocrats he prefers chasing
little white balls to raising lambs, and to
develop his hobby he and his handsome wife
(she is the Fred Fairbairns’ elder girl, Jess)
farewelled their woolly acres, and with their
brace of infants unpacked in the house by
the Sandringham links which they lately
acquired from the Foster Rutledges. The
new champion is the young man who accom-
panied Priminister Bruce on his English
jaunt as confidential sec.
Miss Annie Mitchell, who died last week
after some months on the sick-list, was the
eldest daughter of the late William Mitchell,
President of our House of Landlords—a
clever woman with a remarkable personality
which kept her rich in friends. She is sur-
vived by one brother, the legal knight
Edward.
Popular John Longstaff is convalescing
after his operation. The other day a man
of Toorak said to his wife, whose portrait
John had painted, “Well, what about call-
ing on your artist?” The lady reflected.
“No,” she answered, “I wouldn’t stand in a
queue to see the Messiah !”
Artist Tom Roberts, who has been basking
for some time in his native sunshine after
years and years across seas, is now preparing
to show his last little lot of pictures in the
Fine Arts Hall in Russell-street. The ex-
hibition is dated for September 17.
A Tasmanian in London sends the glad
news that she has been made-over by a
beauty specialist-—all wrinkles ironed out.
hair and figure restored to their youthful
attractiveness, and so on. The only thing
the youth-restorers omitted to do, she
chuckles, was to make away with her almost-
grown-up grandson.
A note or two from Adelaide:—
The Wattle Day committee is pluming itself on
the £ 240-odd netted by street sales of the bloom
last week —a descent from the soaring- returns of
wartime Button Raids, but good for these days of
the shy threepence and the tight pocket.
Gone over the hill, Mrs. C. T. Hargrave, whose
husband was Inspector-General of Roads in the dim
past, and who had passed her own allotted span by
17 years; and, after a brief illness, E. R. Morgan,
whose only son had just come back from England
with his bride, a grand daughter of the late Peter
Waite.
The week-end brought the usual crop of dances,
chief of them the Chocolate and Gold frivol of
Queen’s School old scholars in the Town Hall, where
Iceland poppies and the dull brown of prune foliage,
daffodils and wall-flowers blazoned the school colors.
On the same evening a committee of 20 of the
.younger set were hostesses at a dance at the
Covent Garden Hall ; and at the Palais on the
previous night the Lawn Tennis Association staged
its subscription frivol, which, judging by the crowd
and the brisk trade done at balloon and sweet stalls,
should throw a golden glow over the committee's
balance sheet. The visit of a hockey team from
Lauriston School, Melbourne, was the excuse for
a school dance and a party, with Mrs. Smedley Palmer
as its hostess, at Walford House School.
’Flu, with its usual disregard for mere human
convenience, has laid the Governor low at a moment
when the vice-regal diaries were bristling with en-
gagements. A trip to the North and another to
Melbourne have had to be cancelled, along with such
thrilling assignations as the annual meeting of the
Bishop’s Home Mission Society. His Ex.’s doctors
report him on the mend again, but the Spring Show
bursts upon us this week, and that’s a poor road to
convalescence.
The projected closing of the Grand Central has
already suggested plans for something still bigger ami
better. The matter is “in the air” at present. If
it comes to earth it will be on a big frontage to
North-terrace, opposite Government House, sweeping
the place of several old and low buildings alongside
the Adelaide Club —doctors’ residences in old days,
now professional chambers. The intended name is
the Commonwealth.
Mr. and Mrs. H. Sefton-Jones, English visitors to the
Science Congress, have been showing us a ring which
is believed to be over 5000 years old. It was found
in Egypt and bears the name of Queen Thyi, said to
have been the grandmother of Tutankhamen. The
ring is set with blue pottery of a glaze which was
known only in the 18th Egyptian dynasty, and the
color has never been reproduced.
Clara Serena was one of the songstresses at the
Y.M.C.A. concert given in Lady Howard de Walden’s
London house the other day, with Princess Helena
Victoria and Clara Butt among the audience. At
the end there were congratulations from Clara Butt
and a presentation to Royalty.

which makes exceedingly attractive Walls, Ceilings and Roofs, readily
and at very low cost. We offer sheets 3-16th of an inch thick, for
External or Internal Walls; and sheets 5-32nds of an inch thick, for
Plain Ceilings. These Sheets are perfectly weatherproof, extremely
durable, may be fixed quite simply, and do not need painting.
We manufacture, also, Durabestos Slates, which provide an inexpen-
sive, artistic and effective roof to any structure.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY
Kayser
GLOVES
“No sleeves and skirts narrow and short
—at least eight inches off the ground : this
is fashion’s edict. No waist line; or, it
there is one, it must be in a place where it
shouldn’t be. Black-and-white is the season s
last word in smartness, and silk alpaca the
de luxe material. Red-and-wliite will run
black-and-white a close second, with yellow
a sound favorite. A new and kindly shade is
cocoa (it’s just the shade of milk cocoa) ;
and dull -white sequins, broken up into all
shapes and sizes till they resemble scraps ot
egg-shell, form the newest embroideries on
Paris models. Buttons and tucks by the
gross will appear on every self-respecting
washing frock.
Grand opera moved out of Her Majesty’s
last week to the desolation of the army of
flappers who have split themselves into dif-
ferent tenor followings. One hoist the Bor-
gioli banner, though his glory was somewhat
dimmed by his being so much a family man,
wife’s in-laws (she’s one of the Morts) being
legion; the other adored Piccaluga, 'and 1
many a home nearly ran blood over the
merits of the rival twain. Of the females
of the species Dal Monte and Scavizzi laid
strongest hold. Dal Monte may be described
as a voice in a swathe of fat, but the woman
in Scavizzi captures you before she utters
a note. The internal politics of the com-
bination seemed to be in throes before the
end of the season, and certainly Paolarrtonio
failed to take any curtain calls with the
principals at the conclusion of “The Barber,”
which was really Dal Monte’s farewell.
On Thursday Dame Nellie had her hour.
Unable to be present owing to her bronchial
trouble, the strategian had netted no less
than the State Governor to read her good-
bye to her public. He delivered this against
a background of pale pink roses and carna-
tions on which crimson roses and amber elec-
trics blazoned “Great, glorious Melba. We
love you!” Standing beside her Viking on
the stage was Lady de Chair, in bronze vel-
vets glittering with diamonds and pearls.
It was at her prompting that the orchestra
and the chorus got tlieir crumb.
The house was brimful on both farewell
evenings; there were people supporting
themselves at the back of the circle on
shooting-sticks. The wraps were magni-
ficent ; one was a nocturne of beaten silver
on a moonlight-blue background. The lustre
of beautiful pearls cheered the eye on every
side; among them all Mrs. Tony Hordern’s
lasso was an easy winner. She sat in a
box with Mrs. Pat Osborne and Sunbeam
Mylius, who was more suggestive of a sun-
set in her frocking. In the box opposite
were the E. J. Tait family, with Lady
Helena Rous, as cool as a cucumber in
salad-green frocking, next to the perennial
Tommy Cochrane. Here later in the even-
ing came Scavizzi, her tall slenderness
clothed in black velvet. Lambert, from the
back, made sketches of the artists on the
stage. Perhaps that was why Borgioli kept
his glance in that direction during the
singing lesson with Rosina. Finally, Toti
took her last call, and said her fare-
well speech before a drop curtain which was
a bed of roses. “Toti” being picked out in
red on a white background.
Grafton Elliot Smith and Professor
Johnnie Hunter were lunched by the Insti-
tute of Journalists during the week. Both
are famous in the scientific world for their
uncanny knowledge of anatomy. Elliot
Smith likes his bones a few thousand years
old, and served in mummy cerements;
Johnnie Hunter likes his with the marrow
warm in them, and amenable to reform.
Elliot Smith is middle-aged, thick-thighed,
heavy-torsoed. an old Roman type. Hunter
is dark-haired, slender, with a wide laughing
mouth, is an amazing 24 and looks 19. In
a pre-scientific world he’d have probably
filled in time crusading or being a trou-
badour.
The very learned professor has an in-
teresting story to tell of how civilisation
drifted to Australia and then lost itself for
several thousands of years; but his monot-
onous delivery, involved sentences and a
habit of seizing his lectern with both hands
as if he were about to drive off the platform
in a Ford, militate against him.
A little pink-clieeked girl with eyes like
forget-me-nots once sat demurely in the old
Sydney High School. The girl, who had a
trick of looking at her fellows and particu-
larly at a big boy with a quiet, mouselike
way of nibbling knowledge and pretending
lie was rather a dunce, was Ethel Turner.
The other day she sat at the Journalists’
lunch to Professor Elliot Smith and stole re-
miniscent glances at her one-time school-mate.
The Judge’s lady and the great anatomist
met again, because the world is no larger
than a rolled pancake, but the lady hadn’t
the courage to speak.
While her lord was getting excited over
the beauties of the animal kingdom at the
Cootamundra show, Lady de Chair looked
over a back fence and saw an aeroplane ply-
ing for hire in the paddock next the show-
ground. Flight-Commander Coote, who was
in attendance, saw it at the same moment,
and after watching the airman make several
flights he exchanged the requisite pourparlers
with the owner, and coming back told her
Ex. that all was in readiness. They took
their seats, and pouf! like a thistledown
they floated over the country town. It was
Lady de Chair’s first flight, and Captain
Coote, who used to be a Flight Commander
in the R.A.F., hadn’t been off the ground for
six months.
The city has echoed to the tread of march-
ing feet since Sunday. Happy feet, boys’
feet. It wasn’t all boots, boots, boots either
with the nippers. The monotony of leather
complained of by Kipling’s Tommy Atkins
was broken during Boys’ Week by rows of
twinkling, sun-baked feet that padded on
Monday from the Domain to the Town Hall,
where cargoes of grown-up wisdom were
poured into 10,000 pairs of ears. But the
bread had jam to finish it off—there were free
picture-shows in the afternoon!
The newsboys’ lunch at Farmer’s was
Tuesday's bright spot. The guests fore-
gathered at the sign of the Leather Ball, and
a flag-enclosed wmy led to the marquee speci-
ally erected for the party. Here 300 or more
newsboys put themselves joyfully outside all
manner of liquid effervescence and the accom-
panying meats. The banqueters ranged from
small youngsters, rather scared-looking, but
proud at taking part in the ritual, to cap-
able men of the world, aged around 15; and
the heads ran in coloring from lint-white to
the ginger that every small boy knows as
blue.
While this Letter was slipping into its
pink envelope, the dancing contest between
the Melbourne and Sydney champions was
being decided. The first heat was won by
Sydney, the second went to Melbourne. The
Palais housed the meeting, and literally thou-
sands of dance-lovers came to view the per-
formance. After a few dances had warmed
up the ring, the hig event of the evening
took place. The Melbourne pair moved
smoothly, evenly, with a piston-like preci-
sion—it was wonderfully neat footwork. The
Sydney girl and boy moved with a freedom
of action, a satin-smooth grace and a
bird-like sweep that was sheer poetry of
motion. There was as much difference be-
tween them as between the climates of the
two cities.
Here’s pretty Mabel Batchelor, whose
lyric soprano has been heard in grand and
comic opera, on the concert platform, and
at a hundred private parties. She toured
with Mark
II a m b o urg,
and was with
the Firm’s
grand - opera
productions in
1910 when
Bel Sorrel and
Amy Castles
played alter-
nate lead.
Mabel, who is
a Rose Bay
bud, is one of
a family of
10, all of
whom sing and
play at least
one musical
instrument. As
nippers they
toured as the
C a t h e dral
c h o ris ters.
Signor Di
Georgio and John Lemmone, with whom she
has made no less than five tours, were re-
sponsible for her musical training. The
clever girl is now a constant head-liner in
the various musical societies’ productions.
Girls of all weights and sizes, girls who
looked like Euclid’s definition of a straight
line, girls built on the circular plan, but
every one of them a nice girl, trafficked in
the historic basement of the Town Hall
on Saturday afternoon. They were girls
from the big city firms, and they are out
after a grant of land at Moore Park for a
sports ground. If chins tell anything, then
the land and the clubhouses they intend to
build are already within their grasp. The
City Girls’ Amateur Sports Association is
piloting the movement, and it’s a good one
—provided every reputable city working-girl
who desires to join is eligible for membership.
Yesterday my gun exploded
W T hen I thought it wasn’t loaded ;
Near my wife I pulled the trigger,
Clipped a fragment off her figure ;
Of course I’m sorry and all that,
But she shouldn’t be so fat!
The Coroner found that the victim wasn’t
under perfect control of her brassiere and
corset. But he mightn’t have been so con-
fident of what brassiere and corset can do
if he hadn’t spent an hour listening to Mary
Craven recite her Story of Line at the
Palace last week. That Pitt-street outside
the theatre wasn’t a shambles was mainly
due to the soothing voice and onward urge
of the house-manager and the traffic police-
man. From 12 o’clock any day the steps
of the theatre surged with femininity, all
eager to hear the Berlei expert talk about
her specialties ; and yet there are those who
say our womankind are losing all desire for
restraint! When the “House Full” sign
went up, the barred-out Peris hung around
in the hope that someone might be carried
out fainting, or might have to leave at half
time. Within, mannequins looking like the
pictures of Young Society in the Sunday
supplements did their turn; then, flinging
their sleek outer garments off, emerged
visions of correct corsetry before the avid
eyes of women who rub along “without,” or
with one pair that envelops them from their
Monday morning physical-culture at the.
washtub to their Saturday-night hunt for
bargains in the meat-market. However, it
was exhilarating to learn that there were
women in the world who had corsets for
every occasion likely to arise from the cradle
to the grave. But the crowning touch cflmo
when a girl, the illustrator of the correct
corset for the public performer, bent on giv-
ing credit where credit was due, sang “Be-
cause God Made Thee Mine.”
At Josie Melville’s dinner-dance for the
babies of St. Margaret’s, the Ambassadors
had a hint of Closer Settlement that must
have been heartening to Stewart Dawson
and his lace-enveloped lady. She was presi-
dent of the venture, and now looked upon
her work from the table where the family
sat and dined for the benefit of the babies’
hospital. The little actress who had given
her name to the dance fluttered in when
“Good Morning, Dearie,” had gone to bed;
her entry in a froth of apricot georgettes was
made in the midst of a group of Sallies
dressed in the checks and ginghams of that
young lady before she made her successful
onslaught on New York society. The prize
for the girl who most closely resembled Josie
in the part went to Nell Sutherland; and
the star shingle, the other fiercely-contested
competition, was adjudged to adorn the head
of Violet Cremin.
Those men who go down to Port Jackson
in skiffs, and are known among other old
salts as the "Rowing Association, made a
night of it at the Wentworth last week.
The house-flags of five clubs added glory to
the balcony, while crossed sculls were lashed
with club colors above the orchestral dais.
Among the Mighty sat Mayor Gilpin at a
table which was a riot (no scandal) of Ice-
land poppies. Veteran Deloitte, president
of the gathering, smiled on another success
that was due a great deal to the two secre-
taries, the G. Maxwell and W. J. McDonald
matrons.
The mystery girl who is to take the prin-
cipal singing part in “A Cousin from No-
where,” opening at the Royal on the 27tli,
is really a Bathurst damsel, Jenny Sweet-
man. Jenny came to town some 18 months
ago to take singing lessons, and to pay for
them she worked in McCathie’s. Roland
Foster, who was her teacher, predicted suc-
cess for her after the first few lessons. Jenny,
who is taking the stage-name of Jill Man-
ners, is now being moulded into shape by
Nellie Stewart, Minnie Hooper and George
Highland.
A human note from Helen Holt: —
Brig.-Gen. Reuter Roth has died in Noumea, still
young at 66. Thousands who had only heard of him
as a doctor knew him as a skilful fencer and a
fine officer. I met him first in the long ago, when, as
a child from a North Queensland station, and
feeling like a prisoned creature in a Potts Point
boarding-school, I attended his weekly gymnastic
class and found it the one bright spot in a dreary
week. His understanding kindness then remains a
happy memory. Two years ago, when we met again,
I was proud to welcome him to our home. With
his youth of heart he loved all young things. and
asked to see the smaller children, then in bed asleep.
“But I must leave something for them to see when
they wake,” he said. Taking my scissors and a
sheet of paper, in a few minutes he had cut out two
rows of quaint dancing figures, boys for one, girls
for the other. “Now, come along.” And he fixed
them over the small beds to be their first sight on
waking. It is always the unexpected which pleases,
and I wish he could have known the pleasure he
gave them. But perhaps he does.
An arresting portrait in the Society of
Artists’ show, which opens to-morrow (Fri-
day), will be one of Mrs. George Vivers, by
Lambert. Mrs. Vivers, with her rose-leaf
coloring, golden hair and blue eyes, would
have been a Heaven-sent subject for one of
the old Florentine masters had she lived in
those days. The lady has been painted in a
black evening frock, the skirt a succession of
ruffles from skirt to waist. A streamer of
turquoise blue on the left shoulder and a
red rose under the right ear are the only
bright notes. An exquisite lace and ivory
fan given to Mrs. Vivers by the Earl of Car-
narvon when she was visiting Egypt some
years ago are also in the picture.
One of the four lady Idlers is Annette
Kerr, and her singing bow is a star feature
of the club’s always clever entertainments.
She is a mem-
ber of the
newly - formed
K r e t s c n-
ma n n Clhb,
founded by the
old Master's
pupils to keep
his memory
green. Annette
was one of
K r e t s c h-
mann’s infant
prodigies in
the old New-
bury - Spada
Pop. days, and
made her first
appearance at
one of the
tenor’s con-
certs. Her
father was a
flautist of re-
nown in old
Sydney. In the march of time Annette has
collected, in addition to fame, a singing hus-
band and an Amati fiddle.
Nellie Stewart is still lending a hand.
This time it is in aid of the Rose Day appeal
for the United Charities’ Fund, which is to
be h6ld on Friday, October 10. “Our Nell”
lias promised to take over Stall No. 50, in
Martin-place, where she will sell raffia bas-
kets, biscuits and something chic in silk
hosiery. Fifty stalls have already been
allotted, and a continuous musical entertain-
ment will be provided in city streets by
theatrical artists and bands. A number of
stalls and wheels will turn Customs House-
square into a shopping centre, and a novelty
will be introduced in the form of umbrella
stalls.
Children’s Hospital secretary Clarence
Moss may not be so meek in heart, but he is
blessed, nevertheless. Everybody seems ready
to lend his wonderful institution a hand. The
latest roll-up was of city typists and business-
girls, who stage-managed the happiest dance
of last week at the Palais. Simply hundreds
of girls and boys turned up, the lasses as
manicured and shingled and vanity-cased as
any daughter of the new rich.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Matthew immersed himself in Toowoomba
gaieties last week, one fixture being the Military
Ball. The president of the R.S.S.I.L.A. welcomed the
party, which included Mrs. Adolph Feez, the Nathans,
Mrs. Jenkins, Keene "ullen and Dr. .'Eneas Mc-
Donnell, with Turner A.-D.-C., and H. M. Saunders
wrap-carrying. The ballroom walls, panelled in pale
green with a frieze of ivy and poinsettias, vied
with the lounge window's, which held owls chaperoned
by full moons. Scarlet poinsettia covered the central
electric; cypress and poinsettia garlanded the pillars.
Sooty-hued bats and yellow Iceland poppies patterned
the supper-room, and the vestibule was a mist of
delicate peach bloom and wistaria. Pamela Nathan,
in black and gold, matched the supper-room color
scheme. Mayoress Annand and Mrs. Arthur Feez
wore black, Mrs. Jenkins opalescent georgette, and
Iveene Cullen flame color.
The Bachelors and Spinsters for their ball the next
night borrowed the same fittings and some of the
guests, including Sir Matthew, the McDonnells,
and Mr. and Pamela Nathan, with Turner A.-D.-C.
in charge. In the afternoon his Ex. went to the
polo carnival at Clifford Park. His Ex.’s brother
and Pamela Nathan, the McDonnells, Feezes, Crom-
bies and Donald Fletchers were onlookers. Mrs. New-
man gave a lunch at the polo grounds, amid a riot
of sweet-smelling freezias and Iceland poppies. „
The Bells have a house party at Cottesloe; and
his Ex. and Mr. and Miss Nathan are at Rathdonnell.
Alice and Dorothy Hawthorn poured the fragrant
cup for Berenis Cadell Garrick, who is to be married
this month. Edris Forth, another bride-elect, was
tea-ed amid roses by Mrs. R. W. Vaughan, and
a kewpie dressed as a bride was handed to her.
His Ex. heard the Cherniavskys, who started their
season at His Majesty’s and moved on to the Exhi-
bition to make room for the Williamson vaudeville
turns. It rather goes to Brisbane’s head to have
matinees every day—just like Sydney. The opening
night of the J.C.W. vaudeville found a full house.
Sir Matthew opened the Coorparoo Show with the
support of Pamela Nathan, Mrs. Western Walsh
and A.-D.-C. Turner. In the evening his Ex. had
a dinner party at Government House. Mrs. Walsh
is staying with Miss Pamela.
The Queensland bowlers took the Cafe Majestic for
their shivoo to the N. S. Wales bowlers. There
was dancing, music and much provender, and John
Spence, for the N.S.W. visitors, said nice things
about northern hospitality.
Mabel King, at the Women’s Club, recounted her
experiences in Petrograd just before the war and
during the upheaval, Muriel King creating the
requisite atmosphere with Slav, music, and Rhoda
Felgate with recitations.
Corinda staged a kiddies’ paper-dress ball in the
Shire Hall, and many cunning frocks were manu-
factured 13y the little ones. Jean Kenyon as an
“Early Victorian’’ and Fed Ball as “Tom Mix”
carried off prizes.

DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
One tiling made plain by the racing at
Randwick on Saturday was that Blackadder has a
very good Epsom chance. With 311 b. more than the
Bst. lib. he will have to carry on October 4, the six-
year-old son of The Welkin—Wilari’s Sister justified
his price (5 to 2) for the Flying Welter by leaving
the big field at the distance and finishing four
lengths in front of the second favorite, Villeroy, who
was followed home by Director and Dreblah. Cer-
tainly he had nothing much to beat apart from
Sunburst and Bathos, neither of whom shines at seven
furlongs, but his performance was full of merit
considering that he ran the seven furlongs in lmin.
25jsec. without being ridden out. And he was
burdened with a bit of superfluous flesh at that. To
this page’s cvaj' of thinking, Blackadder’s was a better
Epsom trial than that of Glentruin (9 to 4) in the
w’.f.a. Warwick Stakes, although the English mare
demonstrated that Braeliead, Otacre, Pteropod and
Duke Isinglass are not in her class. An aristocrat
in appearance and a machine-like galloper, the chest-
nut was going easily, with her neck in front of
Father’s Voice (an unthought-of three-year-old brought
across the Tasman by W. G. Stead), at the end of six
furlongs, run in lmin. lljsee., but she doesn’t
look a weight-carrier, and a mile may be a bit
farther than she cares to go. She has 9st. 81b. in
the Epsom—lib. more than The Monk, who tried to
concede her 121 b. and failed wretchedly, although he
seemed to be genuinely backed. The Cypher (4’s)
finished too fast for Irish Rhythm, Polycletan and
16 others in the September Handicap, but the
unlucky little beggar
struck himself during
the race, and at the
moment of writing his
Metropolitan prospects
are clouded with a
doubt. However, the
stable has a worthy
Metropolitan candidate
in Stony, who ran a
great race with 9st.
11b.. (and a 6st. 71b.
minimum) in the Liver-
pool Handicap, and
perhaps was unlucky to
be beaten by imported
Virgin Gold (s’s),
whose party backed
him substantially and
must have collected
quite a fourth of the
winnings attributed to
them by thrilling rom-
ancers of the McShort-
odds school.
JAMES SCOBIE,
who lias trained
the winners of the
last two Mel-
bourne Cups.
The three-year-old form was not particularly en-
lightening as to the Derbies. Heroic got away
badly in the Warwick Stakes and beat only one
steed home —The Dancer. He looks like a horse
who has done little or no fast work, and his A..T.0.
Derbv chance cannot be recommended. Father’s
Voice, his respectable second to Glentruin notwith-
standing, is not bred on staying lines —he is by
Absurd —Shrill ; and Ivillocra, another of the Maori-
landers, has been scratched for the Randwick classic.
Bedorfia’s success (at 2’s) in the first division of
the Three-Year-Old Handicap was largely due to Pike,
who nursed him beautifully, and a bad start; Solidify,
winner of the second division (at 7's), is hardly a
Derby proposition, though evidently a decent sort.
Rugbyean had a very rough passage in Solidify’s
race, and may be depended upon to improve, but it
is questionable if any of the runners at Randwick on
Saturday will seriously enlbarrass Spearfelt and
Arendal.
“S. Gumm”: Troubadour, who won the £5OO
Hurdle at Randwick on Saturday for J. M. Niall,
the pastoralist, now on a visit to Britain, is prepared
by Jack Kelso, who recently got a No. 1 trainer’s
license on turning 21. Since the Franco-Prussian
War, or thereabouts, there has always been at least
one Kelso with gallopers at Randwick, and the game
old Land of Song gelding shares a distinction with
the family—he was the first winner to be led in by
an Australian trainer of the third generation. Like
his father, the owner of Note and Sunburst, his eldest
brother, who assists dad, and his paternal grand-
father, who raced many noted horses in his day, Jack
Kelso understands the thoroughbred in all its moods
and tenses, and Troubadour’s condition was a credit
to him.
* * * »
The alterations to the betting ring at
Caulfield have not worked any vast improvement.
There is certainly more room for punters, but after
Saturday’s meeting many woidd have felt better if
the facilities for losing money had been worse. Stare
(12’s), showing a long-delayed return to form, won
the Heatherlie Handicap brilliantly from All Sun-
shine and Beeline, with the three-year-old Metellus
(a sto 2 favorite") a close fourth. There were few
better horses at Flemington or Randwick in 1922 than
Eerles’s cast-off, and jf he doesn’t go off again he
will be worth considering for one of the Cups, with
Bst. 121 b. at Caulfield and Bst. 51b. at Flemington.
The sour San Antonio (second favorite at s’s) was left
at the post. Whittier, despite his 9st. 111 b., was
reckoned a certainty for the Memsie Stakes, but
honest Englefield (10’s), making good use of an open-
ing left bv Whittier and Sir Dighloek, rap past the
pair in the straight, and went on to win by a
length and a half from the Derby colt Spearfelt,
who was nearly a length ahead of the favorite. Spear-
felt, who is bv Spearhead—Ladv Champion, carried
Bst, 21b., 131 b. less than Englefield, and his finishing
run stamped him a stayer. Wynette, Drongo, El
Dorado and Easingwold (20 to 1 this time) were
also well up, and The Night Patrol, who raced in
Governor Stradbroke’s colors, showed great pace until
his condition gave out. But King Carnival was
never sighted. Wallarak (6 to 4) put another
first to his credit and that of H. L. Beniamin, who
owns him, in a mile Welter; he had got home at
Mentone a week before, after looking hopelessly out
of it. There are good fudges who fancv this reso-
lute finisher for the Caulfield Cup, in which he has
fist. 1 2lb. Hp is a four-year-old chestnut gelding
by Woorak—Sessa.

M. P. Bmild. the Victorian hnndioapner,
who passed out suddenly the day before the Mentone
races (for which he had framed the weights), was
as keen on dogs as on horses. He was a breeder of
champion bulldogs and an active supporter of cours-
ing—he had an interest in Watchguard, which won
the Waterloo Cup a few years ago. Besides handi-
capping for Mentone and Epsom and a number of
country clubs, Bauld wrote a weekly sporting page
for Table Talk. Victoria is becoming an unhealthy
place for racing officials. C. E. Hobson (stipendiary
steward), Norman Wilson (judge) and W. H. Lang
(handicapper) have all weighed in within a short
period, and ill-health has caused the retirement of
Warren "White (chairman of stipendiary stewards),
who has gone back to Queensland.

“H. Hardupp”: A geegee that seems deter-
nunnd to prove the appropriateness of its name is
Always, the crack Western district pony, which has
been doing great things in Melbourne. Its weight
has steadily increased from 9st. to 12st. 71b. without
stopping it. With list. 71b. up at a recent Ascot
meeting, it made 11 opponents in the Essendon
Handicap look like cabhorses ; then, penalised a stone
in a run-off with the winners of two other divisions,
it came home on the bit.
* * * *
“Nitric”: At Poona find.) in .July, the
winner of an Arab pony race returned a dividend
of 17,000 rupees on a 10-rupee Tote. Taking the
rupee at Is. 4d.. this in English money amounted
to £1133 6s. Bd. for 13s. 4d. The only ticket on
the pony was bought by a Parsee. The next biggest
div. known to me was the £1035 paid at a Nelson
(M.L.) trotting meeting in April, 1920.

Patterson and O’Hara Wood may not
bring the Davis Cup back to Australia, hut it is a
creditable achievement to have disposed of all other
challengers. In the early part of the struggle with
the Frenchmen at New York, the Tricolor was in
the ascendant. Young Lacoste—assuredly a world’s
champion in the making—had defeated Patterson in
straight sets (6—3. 6—3, 10—8) and the first set
of the Borotra -O'Hara Wood matoh was 6—l in
the Basque’s favor. But O’Hara "Wood rose to the
occasion, as the man has done so often, captured the
second set (6-—4), lost the third (I—6) and
triumphed in the others (6—4. 6 —2). Then the
Australians had things all their own way in the
doubles against Lacoste and Brugnon (6 —4, 6—4.
6—-2). and, playing as he has never before played in
the U.S.A., Patterson disposed of Borotra in jig
time (6 —4, 6—4, 6—2). Thus for the third succes-
sive .vear Australia earned the right to dispute
America’s possession of the Cup.

Aloe Russell, the Rovnl Melbourne ama-
teur, plaved splendid golf in winning the open
championship of the continent at Sandringham (Vic.).
On the first dav he went out in 32. a really great
achievement, and finished the round in 68. a record
for the course. After that he struck a bad streak,
and for a time it looked as if Carnegie Clark,
unluekiest of professionals, would gain a champion-
ship at last, but suddenly recovering his first dav’s
form, Russell took the last nine helps i n 36 and
finished with a score of 303. Clark (305) was second
Charlie Campbell (306) third, and then followed
Fawcett (307), Ivo Whitton (307), and Le Fevre
(308).

“W T,.” (TT.K.A.) : I doubt if Kirkwood,
the golfer, will ever return to Australia except as a
visitor. He is making from £5OOO to £6OOO a year
by plaving exhibition games with a partner on'the
fashionable links. The clubs advertise the games
and charge admission. These clubs are expensive
to join. The entrance fee is about £lOO in our
money, and the monthly dues are generally 12 dollars.
There is always a long waiting list.
* * * *
“Toosday” (Newkaven, U.S.A.) : At Ant-
werp in 1920, the Yank eight defeated Leander—the
best crew that ever left England, according to Guy
Niekalls. At Paris, Yale showed its heels in convinc-
ing fashion to all its rivals. Yet in the U.S.
Olympic trials Yale was all out to defeat the Naval
Officers, the Naval Academy and Pennsylvania Urii.,
and the indications are that any of" those crews
could have defeated the Europeans, Australians and
South Americans on the Seine. Beyond doubt, both
Australian and English rowing is blue-mouldy with
antiquated ideas of rigging and training. Somebody
should therefore suggest that before there is any
more talk of entering an eight-oared crew in inter-
national rowing wc should scrap the following:
(1) the cut-down boat with narrow bow entry ;
(2) the short slide (24in.) and flat stretcher; (3)
HER FANCY.
GEORGE: “What do you fancy, Grade?”
GRACIE: “Well, I could toy with a plate of
oysters.”
the thole pin; (4) the notion that list, is an ideal
weight for stroke, 7, 2 and bow; and (5) the idea
that “form” will beat brute strength every time.
Reconstruction would include (1) a 24-25-inch beam
boat with bow entry bluffed from No. 3 seat; (2)
a 28in. inclined track to allow each man to use
as much slide as he can ; (3) Belgian lock swivels,
scullers’ stretcher clogs, raked perpendicularly, and
high seating; (4) an age limit of 28 years for each
man, from stroke to bow, who should also be six
feet and at least 12st. in weight after 12 weeks’
training of 15 miles a day. The late Charles Court-
ney, dean of American coaches, was astonished when
I had regretfully to inform him that our lilywhites
used the thole pin and scorned the “professional”
rig. He wanted to know what George Towns thought
about it, and muttered something about Bill Beach
and high seating.

Ancel Bell, a cullud gent, from the U.S.A.,
opened his Australian account well by stopping Wil-
shur, the Canadian lightweight, in 16 rounds at the
Melbourne Stadium. The coon, who fought at Bst.
12f>lb., did not forget to bring a wallop with him
when he left his dear old home in Dixie, and the
alleged Canadian champion was nearly settled in the
“second.” However, he stood his punishment like a
Christian martyr and placed some good jolts occa-
sionally, but Ethiopia’s jaw was like a rock. In the
concluding spasm Wilshur took delivery of several
shattering blows, and the referee intervened none too
soon. When introduced, the previous Saturday, Ancel
had grinned like an embarrassed schoolboy," but he
fought throughout in an earnest spirit—so much so
that for the first few rounds he refused to sit down
in his corner, preferring to stand and glare at the
Canadian until he could get at that unhappy youth
again.

Having heard that Harry Collins was a
nervous starter, Ernie Rice, the English welterweight,
plunged in as soon as the bell summoned the pair
to battle at the Sydney Stadium, and the first round
was all England’s. Not so the second. Returning
to the attack with enthusiasm. Rice landed solidly
with both weapons, until a weighty left hook caught
him on the temple. Then the Newcastle welter brought
his right round to the chin and the bout was over.

Inter-collegiate boxing in Adelaide, a new
departure strongly helped on by Governor Bridges,
has resulted this year in favor of Christian Brothers,
who nominated for the heavyweights a 16-stoner
with, an annihilating punch, and were brilliant also
in other divisions. St. Peter’s and Prince Alfred
were among the also-rans. As intercollegiate sport
in general has mainly been confined to these two, the
new rivalry, with Scotch College also prominent,
should do a lot for Adelaide athletics.
* * * *
“Fana”: Apropos of the match between
Miller and Limutldn (B. 4/9/’24), I doubt if there
is any other form of athletics which imposes so
severe a strain on the bodies of its followers as
wrestling does. In the bout at Chicago between
“Strangler” Lewis and Romano, the Italian, each
man lost 10 pounds through excessive perspiration,
which means that his system was subjected to a
shock from which it would take a considerable time
to recover. Sudden strains and wrenches in wrestling
frequently result in the rupture of small blood-
vessels, and consequent congestion. In my judg-
ment, the wrestler suffers more damage "in one
bout than the boxer in half a dozen, or the foot-
baller in a score.
In a rousing finish for the 10-mile track
championship of N. S. Wales, Alan Gainsford (St.
George) breasted the tape 12 inches ahead of Tommy
Watters (Botany), with Bailey, the previous title-
holder, third. The race was run at Ascot racecourse
and the watch showed 55min. 334 sec. Gainsford
was third last last week in the five-mile. Watters,
who is only 18, is the season’s novice champion.
* * * *
“G. 0.8.”: Yes, Howell did have cruel luck
when in Australia with the last English XI. (11.
28/8/’24). It was a poor fielding side, yet eveii
stars like Hendren, Fender and Woolley dropped
catches that would have made Howell’s average look
a lot brighter. The Warwickshire man had one
gleam of success, however, in the fourth Test at Mel
bourne. He rocked in a delivery which not only
travelled like lightning but broke enough to beat
any bat; and Roy Park walked back to the pavilion
crestfallen. It was Roy’s first ball in Test-matci
cricket, and he has never had another chance.
“Mat”: By making 1000 runs and taking
100 wickets for the 15th time in English county
cricket, Wilfred Rhodes has gone one better than his
fellow-Yorkshireman George Hirst, who performed the
feat in 14 seasons. They are a remarkable old pair,
for Rhodes will be 47 on October 29, and Hirst was
42 when he got his last double (1540 runs and 101
wickets) in 1913. Rhodes first achieved the distinc-
tion in 1903, when he registered 1137 runs and
193 wickets—the latter his best bag. W. G. Grace
got the double eight times, as also did Australian
Frank Tarrant.

The much-prized Magarey medal for bril-
liance (combined with strict fairness) in Adelaide
club football goes this year to Scott, of Norwood.
The four clubs in the .semi-finals are West Torrens,
Sturt, Norwood and Port Adelaide. South Adelaide
went nut gloriously, beating Sturt, and only being
out of the four by reason of Port’s better goal average.
The leading goaikickers for the season are Ryan, of
South, and Owens, of Glenelg, which club has not
won a match.

Saturday saw the end of the first round
in Melbourne League football, and as “the four”
were already decided, it didn’t matter how the
games went. But that was no reason why Essendon,
on their own ground and playing their best team,
should have crashed before the hopeless Melbourne
XVIII , getting but 82 points to the Red Legs’ 96;
or why Fitzroy, similarly fixed, should have been
outed by Collingwood—B6 to 50. South Melbourne,
with nothing to gain or lose, went to Geelong and
defeated the locals by one point—6B to 67 —in a
thrilling game witnessed by 16.500 people, who shot
£383 11s. sd. into the box—both records for Geelong.
The Richmond Tigers pushed themselves securely
into the final quartette by compiling 88 points against
Carlton’s 60.
* * * *
“Gobble”: Objurgation is often a match
winner in Melbourne football nowadays. There are
leather-chasers who can take any amount of rough-
and-tumble without losing their temper, but let an
opponent asperse the family honor and they grow
maniacal for the time being. In a recent game a
Magpie, about to have a pot-shot at goal, was in-
sulted at his most sensitive point. Instead of play-
ing on and winning the game, he heaved the bag
of atmosphere at the foul-mouthed blackguard and
a free-kick was given against him. There are no
free-kicks for “language.”
“H. Hardupp” : A famous Melbourne rover
has been heard to protest that there ought to be a
law to prohibit a bloke’s lady friends from attend-
ing football matches. He was racing along the
boundary in his most dashing style when a glad
cry of recognition smote the atmosphere from the
other side of the pickets. The ball presently going
out of bounds, he was hailed as “Mr. Nobby” by
an excited flapper, who was accompanied by two
sisters and the rubicund matron their mother. After
that, whenever he revisited the neighborhood the
family urged “Mr. Nobby” to walk on the counten-
ances of the opposing team, and once Ma screamed,
“We must arsk Mr. Nobby up to our ’ouse for
a game of crokey.” Naturally the nearby crowd
heard the whole comedy; and since then a ’bailer
who used to have quite a rough nickname has been
plaintively urged to “Bog in, Air. Nobby,” such
exhortations being varied by anxious inquiries as
to whether “Mister Nobby” would care for a
game of crokey.
* * * *
“Wallaby” : One can generally rely on an
entertaining afternoon at the Williamstown (Vic.)
football ground. The gluepot-like stickiness of the
playing area gives an added interest to the game;
and to a supporter of the visiting team there is
always the glorious uncertainty whether at least one
or two of the bluestone boulders which litter the
embankment might be used to quash any unwelcome
opinion he might be indiscreet enough to proffer.
The ground is situated on Gellibrand Point, and on
calm days all sounds issuing from it are echoed
most distinctly from the sea. The sea, of course, i-
known to sigh, roar and whisper; but when, between
its roars, it shouts out “Good lad, Tish!” or “Pot
in the boot, Snow.” one feels that one is experiencing
it in an unfamiliar mood.
* * * *
“Tren”: The biggest sporting event in
Melbourne during Show Week will be a veterans
football match. Mooted by the old champion forward,
Thurgood, to raise--money for the hospitals, the idea
immediately caught on, and before the game was
even arranged old-timers had thrown in just on
£l9OO. Though the match may not be thrilling, the
presence on the field of Johnnv Worrall, Sonny Elms,
Peter Burns, Geoff Moriarty (father of Fitzroy’*
present prodigy), the elder Pannam, Colin Camp-
bell, Thurgood himself, and others who are ranked
higher than any present-day players, will draw a
great crowd of old-timers; and, of course, all the
lawless suburbs will be there in case their deadliest
enemies should strip. What a howl would go up
from assembled Fitzroy if Bryant, ICC., of Essendon,
put the boot into Cussen, C.J., of West Melbourne:
or if Justice McArthur, of Geelong, stoushed Justice
Schutt, of the “Same Old” Essendon!

• The final of the N.S.W. Rugby Union
premiership was fairly easy for Universitv. who led
Western Suburbs by 14 to nil at half-time and
wound up with 19 to 10. Outstanding features of
a bright game were the performances of the full-
backs: Ross (Uni.) kicked four goals, and Whip)'
scored one of West’s tries. ’Varsity has had a
liberal share of the title in recent years, scoring m
1919, 1920 and 1923. West’s last win was way
back in 1902.

\Y armed with the wine that wets the constant win ;
A legend lingers that we never toil
And very seldom spin.
They’d have you think, like anglers in a row,
We loiter and with quiet assurance wait
To haul our mackerel from the depths below
With only sprats for bait.
Deceptive picture and illusion fierce!
Alas! no guardian deity provides
That fortune’s slings and arrows never pierce
Our richly clobbered hides.
We have our crosses, too, you will observe.
The glad tumultuous roar to which we’re prone
Might sometimes, only for our Spartan nerve,
He followed by a moan.
\\ hen stricken Ike or Mo turns anguished looks
That tell of plans agley and hopes a-wreck,
You may conclude the whole brigade of books
lias got it in the neck.
Skittles and beer, forsooth, to yell the odds
And skin the lamb! —as we so oft are told.
Wlmt of the yawning hole in greasy wads
Made by this Virgin Gold?
Withal, stand firm! Close up the ranks once more !
Get none assert beneath the blow we reeled.
Attune again your voices to the roar
“The field ! I’ll lay the field !”
Pepper the dead ’uns, chaps, nor count the cost
And find in this reflection content:
’Tisn’t as- if the thirty thou were lost
Outright—it is but lent!

THE INKY WAY.
“Coot”: The G.O.M. of the Great Write Way in
Melbourne is Ben Hoare, who at 82 still writes
vigorous leaders and “specials” for the Age.
Mrs. George Essex Evans, at present living in
Brisbane, is collecting for a book the verses ot her
late husband not hitherto published in that form.
They will fill a good-sized volume and will include
some of the best work of the Queensland poet.
A. J. Harrop, M.A., a .young Maoriland pressman
who got his diploma in journalism in Christchurch
and then went to England at the expense of the M.L.
University to do research work in history at Cam-
bridge, has joined the staff of Louden Daily Mail.
He has one book to his credit—“ The Story of
Westland.”
Jack McLaren (“McNorth”), who left for London
with his new wife by the Jervis Bay on Aug. 20,
will arrive in time to welcome his newest book, a
companion to “My Odyssey.” But whereas the
“Odyssey” was the story of a roaming, the new-
one is about a sitting-down in the Cape York Penin-
sula for eight years.
“Coot”: The Melbourne Trades Hall Council has
put up £2l for competition in essay writing by
children on “International Peace.” A good subject,
and a commendable gift. But one condition is that
each essay shall consist of 15,000 words —12 solid
columns of Tub Bulletin. What a task to set
children ! And what sweating pay for the job!
“Boioa”: Mrs. Elinor Mordaunt, the writer of
many novels of English and overseas life, is gathering
local color in Papua’s Pearl Islands (the Trobri-
arids) for London Daily News. A book of impres-
sions is on the stocks also, and brown brother of
Papua will figure in the same volume with his
less discolored cousin of Malaya, whither Mrs. Mor
daunt is presently bound.
“S.T.S.”: The new Hardy portrait by Augustus
John, lately hung in the Fitzwilliam museum at
Cambridge, raises the question of how a man’s face
ought to go down to posterity. Hardy is 84, and
in the painting looks it, with a fine wrinkled and
fallen in. He was not like that when at his literary
best; why should the fact that be lived on be a
reason for showing him thus to future ages?
“Harold Hardupp”: Add to obituary items about
the Ballarat Star that T. D. Wanliss, for a long while
its editor in the paper’s early days, died only last
year in Scotland, at the age ot 96. Of its last
proprietary R. W. Baxter continues the Ballarat
Stock Journal; his son, George, takes over the
Sitnuaysia Daily—one-time De Claris’s paper. Vic.
Premier Prendergast once worked as a compositor on
the Star.
“S.T.S.”: This new idea of printing novels in
countries other than the author’s own gives some-
odd results. In a new Robert Pinkerton story, all
about the Hudson Bay Co. and the getting of
furs, the hero is told near the start that he is too
young to be a trapper. In the London-printed
edition, the compositor or lino man, evidently
dreaming of his summer holiday's, has made it “a
tripper.”
“Pro Bono Pub”: I was conscience-stricken when in
a recent English Bookman I read Freda Sternberg’s
observation on The Bulletin that “every Australian
and New Zealander cherishes the desire to write for
that paper.” I am glad to think that in yielding to
the universal urge I shall now cease to be the lament-
able exception to the rule. For to judge by the
number who tell me so, every other Australian and
Maorilander has written for the ruddy paper.
“Chhota Peg” : One of the Argus’s oldest and most
staid Parliannntary men got the shock of his life
the other day r when he strolled into the press gallery-
in the House of Reps, and found his seat usurped
by a copy-boy from one of the evening papers.
While he stood aghast at the sacrilege, the kid
turned round and asked calmly, in a tone audible
on the floor of the House, “I suppose that blankard
over there in the flash clobber’s Bruce, is it?”
“C.McL.”: An author has to put up with many
things, but out of the hundreds of only too com-
plimentary correspondents who have written to, me
from America, only one, who signs himself “Don
Marquis,” has burst into song about that shocking
book, “Post Mortem.” Here is his lyric:—
There was an old fellow named Sydney,
Who drank till he ruined a kidney.
It shrivelled and shrank,
But he sat and he drank....
Well, he had his fun doin’ it, didn’ he?
The man who could find two rhymes to Sydney must
be addicted to brain-waves !
“Ashmead”: Among the Speck's oldest inky way-
farers is J. V. (“Barney”) Sullivan, for many years
sub. of Launceston Examiner. He began on an R.c.
journal, and after a few years with the Launceston
Telegraph crossed the street to the Examiner, 'then
he resigned the other day after 24 years’ serucc
the literary men gave him an illuminated address
and something else to show their regard, and the
“chapel” also gave him some of the something else
in a wallet. Sullivan has been president ot the
Launceston sub-district of the A.J.A. for years, ana
was re-elected at the last meeting. Despite his long
innings, he reckons he is still good for a bit ot
free-lancing.
“H.K.”: Recent mention of William Balcombe,
the first N.S.W. Colonial Treasurer and former
friend of Napoleon, recalls that he was accompanied
to Sydney by his son, Thomas Trywhitt Balcombe,
who was born en St. Helena in 1810. In 1831 the
younger man was appointed a draughtsman ln tnc
Surveyor-General’s Department, and carried on there
till 1861, when, owing to severe mental worry, he
committed suicide. He was a very spirited animal
painter, and many of his pictures of horses were
produced in Bull’s Life in Sydney, a complete hie
of which is in the Mitchell Library. He dul a
good deal of writing too, and published at least
one volume —about the early goldfields.
“Amity”: The charge of plagiarism
playwright of the “Message from Mars” (B. 21/8/ -4)
ignores the possibility of coincidence. The frequency
with which writers strike the same idea at tic
same time is remarkable. Not long ago an An-
tra lian writer accused me of stealing his idea,
although my stuff had been accepted and paid lor
by The Bulletin long before his appeared. - .
title was different originally, but The B. had change
it to the same as his —which naturally strengthens
his conviction that I had been cribbing. Mae as
another remarkable coincidence. In the tie Lt cr
Du Maurier’s “An Englishman’s Home was nrs
staged in London, The Bulletin published a ,
sketch by Arthur Adams on exactly the same iin>-.
showing the helplessness of an ordinary citizen in •
hostile invasion. The resemblance between the pin
and the sketch was such that only the simultaneous
publication saved the Australian from the charge
cribbing. Strangest of all, in each case the citizen
was named Brown ! ..
“Coot” : Melbourne’s Yorick Club has an interest a
its own for Inky-wayfarers. It was founded in
bv F. W. Haddon, then editor of the Australasian.
Its first secretary was Marcus Clarke, and in it he
wrrte most of “The Peripatetic Philosopher am
“His Natural Life.” Among the original 39 membe-
were Adam Lindsay Gordon, Alfred Telo (of the Age;.
G-. \V. Rusden (the historian), George Collins Levey
(afterwards editor of the Age), James Stiffe (who
claimed to be the author of London P’unch s„ ce

After a brief respite the overworked
echoes of Her Majesty’s, Sydney, resumed
duty on Saturday night with the somewhat
tinny music and song of “Whirled into
Happiness.” A crowded and less anxious-
eyed audience laughed at jokes in their own
language and applauded sentiments they
could understand without having to consult
their programmes, and did it with the
promptness of real appreciation, the removal
of the gorgeous flunkeys and the red carpet
of the Italian opera season having doubtless
helped to restore their confidence.
* * * *
After needlessly complicating itself in the
first act, “Whirled into Happiness” com-
mences spinning in the second, and by the
third is rotating as madly as the prayer-
wheel of a pious lama. The play proves
more of a feast for the eye than for the ear,
though Maggie Jarvis, as Florrie, the mil-
lionaire hatmaker’s daughter, contrives to
fall melodiously in love with Harold Pearce,
who as Horace Wiggs, a hairdresser’s assist-
ant, has greatness and a marquisate thrust
upon him by a chain of circumstances some-
what wearisome to follow. With the com-
petent assistance of Alfred Frith’s broad
face and humor, the hairdresser’s assistant
makes a raid as the Marquis Brancaster into
the opulent but uncultivated social circle of
the hat manufacturer, where he is received
with plump and open arms by Rosie le
Varde. as Mrs. Horridge. Owing possibly to
the absence of intoxicating liquor and a
, basement, the Horridges’ ball is conducted
with the utmost propriety; and, the floor
not being unduly crowded, Michael Cunning-
ham and Hazel Clements, surely the last
words in whirlwind dancers, find room to
gyrate in a manner quite beyond the capa-
city of ordinary devotees of jazz; while
Ueita Nugent, as a fairy on the Conan
Doyle model, dances charmingly to an
accompaniment of large purple fireflies un-

known to science; delighting the eyes of
Flame, whose engagement to the pseudo-
marquis is making her see things. The
parents of the real marquis turning up. in-
opportunely. Florrie’s dreams are rudely dis-
pelled, and the curtain descends on the second
act in an atmosphere almost as thick with
gloom as “La Tosca.” In the last act. how-
ever, Florrie decides that a hairdresser in
tlie hand is worth many marquises in the
bush, and is reconciled to her lover in the
appropriate setting of a barber’s shop, whose
equipments suggest that the tonsoriai prac-
titioners of George-street still have a lot to
learn. Winnie Collins made a tempestuous
Delpliine, a music-hall star with a French
accent, and Cecil Kelleway behaved as a
maker of imported hats would be expected
to behave. The absence amongst the princi-
pals of the godlike gift of song was partially
compensated for by the swirl of expensive
lava-lavas and the glitter of silver-sheathed
bodies provided by the home-grown chorus,
who appeared to whirl the rest of the east
into happiness somewhat against their will.

Sydney Tivoli programme is much the
same as it was a week ago, the only differ-
ence being the entrance of Teddy Stream,
character comedian, who serves up faith-
ful, well-rehearsed studies of orthodox types.
Irene Franklin, with her unique coiffure and
pleasing personality, is still in vigorous de-
mand, and Peter Donald’s witticism is satis-
fying the gallery.
“The Man from Brodney’s” is making a
mild hit at Sydney Lyceum. An ex-diplomat,
it is his job to arbitrate between a rebellious
mob of Mohammedans and a not-too-straight
white owner of an island in the Indian seas.

species, usually bitter rivals, have joined to-
gether for the moment to simper over
“Second Youth,” at the Crystal Palace. “The
Next Corner,” at the Globe, is a thing of
rapid action, illustrating incidentally the
mess which some women get into —all for a
mysterious thing they call Love. Pinero’s
“Enchanted Cottage” is drawing the crowds
to Hoyt’s—a “To Let” notice advertising a
six-roomed bungalow for ten shillings a week
couldn’t draw a larger crowd. Added Hoyt’s
attractions are “The Hill Billy,” with .Tack
Pickford filling a bucolic role, and Jack Can-
not in a variety turn.
About a Sydney show of etchings:—
The cause of Australian forestry should benefit by
H. van Raalte’s insistence that gum-trees have souls.
In nearly all the pictures at present on show at
Gayfield Shaw’s Gallery he emphasises the individu-
ality of his arboreal models. by placing them in a
dramatic spotlight belonging rather to the stage
than to this Australian world of crystal air and
sunny skies. “The Gust” is a moving study of
gouty old age, protesting that it is as young as ever;
“The Monarch” lifts up its crown of leaves like the
last of a proud dynasty of despots—it is, in fact,
sole survivor of an edition of 22 and is priced at 60
guineas ; “The Shell” has died like a warrior, stand-
ing in its boots. Anybody who, after looking at
these memorials of the last giants of the bush, can
go home ar.d chop down a living specimen without
feeling like a murderer is lost to hope.
From the time when Apollo Granforte un-
burdened the passionate heart of the footman
Carlo Gerard in the first act of “Andrea
Chenier,” the audience which crowded His
Majesty’s was gripped by the dramatic action
of an opera new to Melbourne. That open-
ing put the shadow of tragedy over the
frivolity of the merrymakers in the Castle of
the Contessa Di Coigny, in the midst of
which Madeleine’s request to Andrea Chenier
for a poem induces a passionate declara-
tion of his belief in liberty, and his abhor-
rence of the selfish behavior of the aris-
tocracy. This act gives an opportunity for a
skilful contrast of emotions in the light care-
lessness of Madeleine and the intense earnest-
ness of Andrea. The second act finds the
latter tunefully expressing his disillusion-
ment with liberty as typified by the rule of
flic mob; and a meeting with Madeleine,
who, terrified for her life, claims his aid,
brings a clash with Gerard. Wounded by
Chenier, who is already suspect for his lack
of sympathy with the excesses of the revolu-
tion, Gerard now denounces him as a traitor.
The third act, in the gloomy surroundings of
the Tribunal of the Committee of Public
Safety, provides the best work in the opera
in the appeal of Madeleine to Gerard for
Chenier’s safety. Here Lina Seavizzi was
momentarily astray, and tried some mezzo
voce effects; but she compensated by strong
work, in which the sense of despair that over-
laid all her pleading was well indicated, and
Granforte’s portrayal of the growth of re-
morse and his generous effort to undo his
harm was very tine. In the last act Madeleine
secures a way into Chenier’s prison, and goes
with him to the tumbril upon the top note.
* * * *
Although Piccaluga (Chenier) and Lina
Scavizzi received a larger share of the ap-
plause, the artistic triumph of the evening
was Granforte’s. Besides being in great

voice, and singing with truth and feeling,
he gave a dramatic representation of the
complex character of Gerard and its develop-
ment —the bitterness of his sense of wrong
conflicting with his love for the daughter of
a hated class, the initial tendency to mis-
use power when it was new to him and the
ultimate emergence of the real greatness of
his spirit from the fires of his emotion. In
the scene in which that conflict was de-
veloped he managed to express it in every
note he sang. Piccaluga’s opportunities
were in the fine aria in the first act, and the
last uplift of tumultous harmony with Made-
leine, in which he thrilled the audience;
and no one was prepared to take any notice
of the fact that he wrote his last poein with-
out a light in a prison so dark that its cus-
todians had to carry lanterns. Carmen Tor-
nari deserves a word for her work as a bent
old lady ; Doris Mclnnes, with no singing
opportunities, was a stately Contessa; and
Gaetano Azzolini provided some flashes of
humor; Paolantonio shared the cheers at
the drop of every curtain; yet more than
once the orchestra utterly overwhelmed the
singer.

Melbourne has discovered that the colorful
“Rise of Rosie O’Reilly” is as good as a pan-
tomime —and a lot cleaner than some shows
allegedly provided for Australia junior. As
a result young Miss Melbourne and Master
Yarra have appeared in great numbers
amongst the well-filled seats at the New
Princess’s; and although one kid, evidently
sophisticated in plays with a more serious
intention, lifted up her Amice as one who had
been cheated because no one was killed before
the end of the last act, most of the young-
sters appear delighted that the Avhole com-
pany is alive. Reduced matinee prices are
helping the mid-week services to be every-
seat-occupied affairs; but that is only one
of the signs that Rosie has struck popu-
larity.
The managerial boast that Muriel Starr
is the most popular actress in Australia is
given no denial by the audiences which
respond to the invitation to watch her go
the “East of Suez” Avay to a bad end. Still,
the Chinese atmosphere pervading the King’s
is no doubt part of the magnet. The lady
who prior to a recent performance announced
that she had come along “to see lioav the
Chinese really live” was probably dis-
appointed ; but her desire shows at least one
of the reasons for the pull Maugham’s play
is exerting.
No doubt because man in the main is a
good-natured animal avlio likes a joke against
himself, Hetty King remains the prime
favorite at Melbourne Royal. Added to the
hilarity are Jan de Martel, a moderately good
patter-artist, with some smart equilibristic
tricks; and Ross, Barker and McLennan,
a local trio, whose turn is described as “Ace-
high Jazz”- —their ace is as good as a trump,
anyway. And a word is earned by.“ General
Ed. Eavine. who adds some humorously con-
trived staging to an acceptable mixture of
juggling and nonsense.
Billed as “Fred Lake and Partner,” the
impression at the opening of one of Mel-
bourne Tivoli’s new acts is that the partner
is a lady. Actually it is Fred Lake; after
an excellent impersonation lie discards the
feminine adornments, and presents an enter-
taining act in his own proper person—with
the aid of the partner at the piano who is
at first thought to be himself. Holloway and
Austin do some hazardous work on a wire;
Hymac lias a new act which is generally
better than his first; and the bills mention
the last nights of Whelan, whose “whistling
solo” is now shrilled by a great part of the
house as it files out—with a lead from the
orchestra.
Two artless exhibitions :
In liis exhibition at the Decoration Galleries, Mel-
bourne, Meynell Withers to some extent disarms
criticism by emphasising his tenderness ; but he shows
none of the passionate convictions of youth, which,
if blatant, are still convictions. Plainly the young-
artist is not decided yet about what he wants to
paint. There is a mixture of painstaking detail
and painful impressionism in some of the pictures
he presents; and his cows and horses have come out
of an ill-selected Noah’s Ark. The artist -(whose
father also was an artist) has the ambition to go
to Europe for study, this show being a means to that
end; and when he thoroughly decides what he wants
to paint and the method he desires to employ, and
develops a temperament which an apparently shel-
tered life has denied him, he may do much better
work.
Love of a world of mists and fog is shown in Miss
C. Beckett’s exhibition at Melbourne Athenaeum Hall;
and after an inspection of the harsh backgrounds of
pictures which show no mists, a suspicion arises
that it is not always love for the fog that makes
her embrace it- —sometimes it is fear of what her
painted world would look like without it. And the
lady has no right to make the same wood (painted
green) serve both for her boats and for her sea-
waves. There are some fog effects that are fairly
good; but the still-life studies, notably No. 21,
are the best of the show.
Adelaide shows have bucked up with the
coming of Spring. At the Royal is the
delightful “Lilac Time,” with John Ralston a
Pickwickian but pathetic figure as Schubert.
The supporting crowd is strong, and Eve
Lynn gets well into the spirit of the period
as the demure heroine. Chisholm lias too
little to do, Claude Flemming is at his best,
and Stigant is responsible for most of the
fun. Of the other sex, Bryl Walkcly and
Katie Towers put in brilliant work ijn
incidental characters. The absence of a
chorus is a notable feature of this unusual
opera, but whenever anybody sings half a
dozen clever friends are ready with the
refrain. At the Prince of Wales, Seymour
Hicks is great every way as Old Bill.
There arc crowds of other people, but he
dwarfs them all. The play is oddly like
“Our Selection” in spots, even to Dad going

-the NEW EDISON
Did you know that Thomas J..
Edison has invented a human-
voice reproducing instrument that
does not betray itself in the very
presence of the living artists?
This he has actually done, and
more than fifty of the world’s
greatest artists have sung or
played in direct platform com-
parison with the New Edison’s
Re-Creation of their voices or in-
struments.
On these occasions musically-
critical audiences discovered to
their amazement that not a tone,
not a subtle color, varied in the
slightest degree —the most deli-
cate variations were exquisitely
matched- —the voice of instrument
and artist shaded into each other
perfectly.
By one of the most marvellous achievements of modern science,
the problem of perfect music for the home has been solved.
Hear the New Edison for yourself—five minutes of your time
now may mean the enrichment of fifty years of your life.

ST KILDA MELBURNE
“W.J.P.F.”: Next to Toti dal Monte,
Augusta Concato (Signora Piccaluga in pri-
vate life) was the most useful and consistent
artist in the Grand Opera Co. in Sydney.
Coming on late in the season, when Melba
and Scavizzi were out of action, she shared
the burden of August, the bad-weatlier month,
with Toti. If either dame had broken down
then, it is hard to know what would have
happened; probably the season would have
collapsed for want of prima donnas. But
Concato, who is as plucky and capable as
she is pretty, stood up to the work and
quickly reeled off nine performances of
AN UNSUCCESSFUL SUCCESS.
“ That’s a ripping portrait of Mrs. Jazz.”
“Fes, it’s such a blinkin’ good likeness she
won’t let me show it at the next exhibi-
tion.”
“Aida” (a tremendously heavy role) and
three of Maddalena in “Andrea Chenier,” be-
sides filling in time with the parts of Butter-
fly and Santuzza. One Thursday, after play-
ing “Aida” at the matinee, she was Santuzza
at night, and one wonders how her voice
stood it. In the Egyptian opera she had to
sing against an orchestra of 50, a stage
band, four strident trumpets, five other heavy
principals and a chorus of over 100 voices,
and even then her fine voice rang out clearly
above the musical din.
“Pollio”: Now that the Sydney opera sea-
son is over, what has it given us? Eighty-six
performances of sixteen operas, most of them
genuine antiques. Of recent music—that is
to say, music produced within the last
quarter-century—two operas only, “Tosca”
Q 900) and “Madame Butterfly” (1904).
1 et within the first 14 years of this century
15 notable works arrived. In the period
1900-22 more than a thousand operas were
produced. Of the thousand couldn’t we have
been trusted with more than two?
“R.K.D.N.”: Yes, the industrious George
M. Golian must indeed be doing well out of
Australian royalties (B. 28/8/’24) ; but they
will show a falling-off shortly unless he dis-
covers a new plot for his song-and-dance con-
coctions. The Cinderella motif wears thinner
and thinner. “Rosie O’Reilly” is but a
shadow of her sister, “Nellie Kelly,” and
compared with both these younger colleens
“The O’Brien Girl” is a robustious heavy-
weight. Apropos, Melbourne Argus has been
pleading once more for better plays, and, in-
cidentally, mentioning that the William-
son firm, on the strength of the public
interest in Galsworthy’s “Skin Game,”
promised to supply them. I see no
sign of such on the horizon. We are
getting little but American stuff:
“Kempy,” and its successor (“The Old
Soak”), “Good Morning, Dearie,” “Nellie”
and “Rosie” are all from the land of dope and
jazz. As for the local author —well, he’s a
Mrs. ’Arris.
“Clement R. d’Uppe”: The Steelworks
Band, which won the Bellevue Open Band
Championship at Manchester, is purely Aus-
tralian—-almost purely Newcastralian. With
the exception of a feav soloists, the combina-
tion, when it is not executing trombone
cadenzas, doing cornet arpeggios or accom-
panying drum arias, does strenuous work at
the B.H.P.’s noisy show at Port Waratah.
Baile, who wields the stick, combines con-
trapuntal preciseness with business acumen.
When the potentialities of Wembley became
apparent he enlisted the services of George
Portus, doyen of Australian advance man-
agers. George went up to Newcastle and
got a few pub-keepers and other high-spirited
souls to guarantee the fares of the band. Off
went the band, and with them George and
Baile. Being an Australian combination,
there wasn’t much for them when the big
Wembley engagements were being handed
out. So the Steelworks Band got hard up—
so hard up, in fact, that four men had to be
sent back, simply because the funds de-
manded that expenditure be reduced to a
minimum. With their backs against the wall
and with their purses light, the others under
Baile’s command have now beaten the best.
One can see the shimmer of George Portus’s
silvery locks amidst the applause of the
north-countrymen.
“Hamfat”: The Newcastle (N.S.W.)
Steelworks Band’s victory over all the bands
of Britain is making the Melbourne suburb
of Malvern feel proud. The Malvern band
has twice beaten the Newcastle combination
in Australian competitions. The ironworks’
combination of blowers upon instruments of
brass has doubtless improved since then, and
Malvern mightn’t have much of a show
against the victors at Manchester. Never-
theless a challenge contest will probably
ensue when the musical ironworkers return.
“Adelaide”: Sorry that “Bad Bill” should
have been made “tired” (B. 28/8/’24) by
my account of Whelan’s finally taking
Girard’s place in “The Belle of New York”;
but when he says that I “place” the incident
in Adelaide he has, unfairly, the air of one
nailing down for the umpteenth time a dis-
credited story. Yet the facts are simply as
I gave them. That Girard was a dying man
when he reached Adelaide was kept dark.
Told to look for a fine performance by an
American stranger, we saw a fine perform-
ance, and had no idea for a day or two that
there had been a substitution. Girard made
a later attempt to resume playing, but re-
tired finally with the (pathetic in the cir-
cumstances) “Pipes are frozen” gag, and
thenceforward the part was Whelan’s. All
this is matter of history, and no fatigue on
the part of anyone at a distance can blot out
a word of it; also Girard’s tombstone at
West-terrace is a fairly solid piece of evi-
dence. As the sailor said in a similar case,
“I ain’t arguin’; I’m a -tellin’ yer.”
“Dick Sniveller”: The only thing wrong
with Bransby Williams (B. 4/9/’24) is the
way he drags out his turn. A public accus-
tomed to snap in its entertainments grows
restive when the Dickens performer burbles
about “my next impersonation,” strolls off
and on again with part of the costume of
the character, and then “makes up” slowly
with his back to the audience. If Bransby
would put a bit of “hurry up” into his
methods I don’t think he would ever have
occasion to complain of his reception.
Norman Campbell writes :
“L.L.,” who suggests (B. 4/9/’24) that Zora Cross
made “a textual slip only likely to be detected by
Poverty Pointers in her book ‘Daughters of the
Seven Mile,’ ” might be informed that George Rig-
nokl and Essie Jenyns did play together in Shaks-
peare. Essie was the boy (an important part) in
one Rignold production of “Henry V.” As to the
spelling of her stage-name, her father was a Dr.
Jennings, who practised in Queensland. Essie, born
in Brisbane, was 12 years old when her father died,
and her mother went on the stage as Kate Arden
and married W. J. Holloway. Zora Cross is too
thorough in her work and too well-informed on stage
matters to make a serious slip. She herself is a
Poverty Pointer and has fretted her hour with many
leading Australian shows. It was my privilege to
be associated with her in the Famous Players co.
under the Hugh D. Mclntosh banner, when we did
Henry Arthur Jones's “Hypocrites” and other high-
class plays. The lady knows the Australian theatre
from paint-frame to proscenium.
“H.H.” : All the windy claims about who
is the best Australian roughrider are to be
brought down to a sharp test at a “Rodeo,”
timed to coincide with Melbourne Show Week,
which starts on September 20. “Snowy”
Thompson, who returned with more griev-
ances than laurels, from the Wembley con-
tests, was greeted on his arrival by challenges
from Monty Miller (Vic.) and Victor
Cowan (Q.), who both claim to be better
at the game than Hugh D. Mclntosh’s
nominee; and probably there will be others.
Thompson has accepted the challenges and
agreed to put up a side wager of £lOO with
Miller. One of the promoters of the tourna-
ment, which will take place at Wirtlis’ Olym-
pia, is Frank Howson, who claims the Aus-
tralian long-ride record—22l miles in 33
hours from Booligal, on the Lachlan, to
Kilfera station and back—in July, 1884,
when he was a wool-scouring contractor.
The mare he rode, Kilfera, was a grey that

HAMFAT: “If I’m Oliver Goldsmith, the author of the
play.”
USHER: “Oh, certainly, sir—step right in, sir.”
cost him £7, took beer as a stimulant, and,
following Ilowson’s record ride, added 100
miles on the next two days—32l miles over
rough country in four days.
“Lond” : The British censor has put a new
play by Rann Kennedy on his index. Ken-
nedy’s “Servant in the House” could just
possibly be taken as having no sacred under-
meaning ; but “The Chastening” leaves no
loophole. Barred from the theatres, it has
been played on Sunday in a church, and
several times in a public hall. The author
impersonates the Carpenter and Edith
Wynne-Matthison, his wife, the Madonna;
but the all-important character of the Son
has unwisely been given to a girl—and with
a strong American accent at that.
“Chiron”: I remember Mr. and Miss Tree,
mentioned by “J.F.H.” (B. 28/8/’24). when
they showed at the Hobart Prince of Wales’s.
Their performance evoked open-mouthed
wonderment. A local musician of some re-
pute dug up an old composition which he
declared had been buried for 40 years, and
invited a number of friends to witness the
downfall of the pair when he whispered the
title to the parent Tree. But Miss Tree
played it right away.
“Dr. Nil” goes to the show: —
“The Man in Dress Clothes,” which I saw in Adel-
aide the other night, is almost everything that is
bad in a play. The plot is toothless with age. A
couple marry but do not “live together.” The lady
tires of the arrangement; the gentleman adopts substi-
tutes. She asks for her “freedom,” which is
granted, although he loves her all the time. In the
second act Madam discovers that she loves her lord.
In the third act the discovery becomes mutual; and
down comes the curtain. The author of the rubbish
does not evolve any new way of putting these
banalities before the audience. His characters are
uninteresting and the lines they speak are dull.
To me the one original thing in the piece is the res-
taurant scene, and it is original only in the sense
that I never before saw a restaurant scene in which
the two principal characters carried on a loud and
lengthy dialogue while all the rest of the customers
sat absolutely still and silent like so many wax
figures. But perhaps that was necessary in order not
to interfere with the “action” of the play.
“G.A.C.”: The Australian in London finds
more familiar faces in the theatres than any-
where else. From Florence Austral at
Covent Garden to some small-part player in
a two-shows-a-night musical comedy in the
suburbs, he sees them in abundance. For the
most part they belong to English mummers
who shed the light of their countenances
upon Australia for a brief period and re-
turned to comparative obscurity. Musical
shows in London are frankly bad. The
choruses and ballets arc colorless and ragged.
One looks almost in vain for a pretty girl
or a neat pair of ankles, and hungrily re-
calls the three rows of beauty and grace that
the much-maligned Firm serves up in revue
or comic opera. It is significant that little
Eve Grey, who never got much of a chance
in the Commonwealth, was made second lead
at Daly’s a month after she arrived unknown.
“Centurion”: “Hamfat’s” Chinese opera
co. (B. 21/8/’24) came to Cooktown (N.Q.)
from Java in 1894. I saw it in Townsville
a year later, when I was introduced to the
Melba of the crowd, a cadaverous gent, with
a good sense of his own artistry. The finest
thing about the show were the magnificent
embroidered dresses, which,
with some old Chinese
weapons and armor, dragged
me to the theatre several
times. The orchestration
was an unintelligent antici-
pation of Richard Strauss,
and the squalling recitative,
which was the only method
of expression, was like no-
thing I ever heard before or
since. The strings, drums
and gongs were on the stage
with the actors, and neither
lot heeded the other —just
went ahead with its own
job. What the show was
about I could never divine,
but Brisbane stood it for a
time at the old Theatre
Royal.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: John
Kirby, of the portly figure
and the ingratiating smile,
is the son of a walking
lexicon of industrial law,
who, as representative of
sundry employing interests,
looks after the disputes of
theatrical managements with
the unions. He was the
first inspector appointed
under Wade’s Industrial
Disputes Act (N.S.W.).
The younger Kirby was in-
tended for the law, but a
passion for amateur theatri-
cals, in which he appeared
with a Petersham ( N.S.W.)
society, led to the usual
result. The professional
stage gave him his first
chance in “The Monk and
the Woman.” After a tour
with Julius Knight he went
to the war, and since he was demobilised he
has never had occasion to advertise that he
was “resting.”
“Lud”: Will Evans, the vaudeville
comedian, who was starring (more or less)
on the Tivoli circuit a short while ago, is
part-author of a farce called “The Other
Mr. Gibbs,” which was recently put up at
the London Garrick. It was his second ven-
ture as playwright, for William had a hand
in the big draw “Tons of Money.” But his
latest attempt turned out a dud. It was
withdrawn on the seventeenth night. You
never can tell.
“Hamfat”: A lucky patch in the career
of old George Dean (B. 28/8/’24) was the
period during which he heaved illustrated
songs at a sentimental proletariat. George’s
singing voice was only so-so, wdiile the ditties
were dreadful, and the, colored lantern-
slides unspeakable; but the great ’eart of

“When the Whistle Blows at Six” the family

few at the Pig and Whistle being overlooked.
Verdant green was the main feature of the
picture slides, and perhaps it was appro-
priate to the audiences. Anyhow, the illus-

“Pantagruel”: The “open-air cinema con-
traption,” mentioned by “N. West” (B.
7/8/’24) as housing Lionel Walsh’s co. in
Rockhampton, is the finest and largest open-
air theatre in Queensland, being one of Birch,
Carroll and Coyle’s string. It is only since
the reorganisation of that firm a little over
a year ago that Queensland country towns
have been getting regular visits from capable
companies. Until then Rockhampton saw
a decent show once in a blue moon ; now it
has one practically every week, and the
people turn out in full force. The “house”
that welcomed “The O’Brien Girl” was so
huge that Walsh almost jumped with joy.
“Never saw anything like it in my life,” he
said.
ODE TO A NIGHT-IN-GALA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In the Town Hall basement were about a thousand
men and women, fully half of whom showed unmis-
takable signs of having imbibed too freely. In the
corridors conditions were worse.” —Police report on
Sydney Artists’ Pall.
My head aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
My innards, as if pinkie I had drunk,
Or quaffed some hooch-like compound to the drains
And found the floor a sadly springless bunk.
This somewhat odoriferous place, I think,
Must be a fo’c’sle. Was I then shanghai-ed
By brutal crimps about the Rocks that go
And, stupefied by drink,
Hoisted and hustled up some vessel’s side
That’s clearing through the Heads for Callao?
I hear the clink of bottles at my feet,
The air is heavy with the scent of nips.
Have I been “warehoused” in that cool retreat
Wherewith the thoughtful publican equips
His out-back shanty? Nonchalantly shot
Into some “deadhouse” sinister and grim
Where navvies who have quenched their raging
thirst
With multitud’nous pot
Wake with parch’d throats and recollections dim,
Recuperated for another burst?
Darkling I strive to place myself in vain.
These chaps like cops who view the scene and frown,
Are they but figments of my fevered brain?
Why, here’s an emperor and there’s a clown !
Stay, the mist clears. ’Twas but last night, I wis,
In ripe Bohemian mood I left my home
To tread a measure at the Artists’ Ball.
Then comes a gap. But this
Darned tragic basement, slippery with the foam
Of perilous beers —why, ’tis the old Town Hall!

FEW short years ago the grim-jawed hardy men who laid
the foundation of Australia's rural prosperity sacrificed
themselves to a life of unremitting labour. Toiling from
early morn till dewy eve, their dreams of an ultimate
competence frequently dissolved into nightmares, in which loomed
the tragic words ** mortgage/' ** foreclosure ** and ** bankruptcy."
They fought against odds which the farmer of to-day knows little
of, but with the advent of the Case Tractor the dawn of a new
era came. The Land of Promise became the Land of Fulfilment.
It made the difference between living to farm and farming to live.
With it the death-knell of the plough horse was sounded, and in a
hundred ways the Case Tractor revolutionised the work on the farm.
It relieved the farmer from being a slave to weather conditions ; it
enabled him to plough more land in less time ; cut down his wages
bill for man-power ; gave him leisure in which to study farm
management, and at the end of the year showed him not only bigger
returns but larger profits.
Kerosene Farm & General PurposeTracfor
To-day the harvest that is to be may be anticipated in large measure
by what the Case outfit can accomplish* In fact> this powerful
Tractor is in many ways an insurance against the vagaries of weather
conditions, and from the moment of ploughing the untilled land till
the harvest is safely housed the Case is the most dependable asset
on the farm.
Farmers intent on success owe it to them-
selves to become acquainted with this
Tractor.

thing. You’ve forgotten the case of the St. lvilda
(Vic.) couple who, in order to detain a burglar they
had captured the other night, cut his braces. Cer-
tainly in war it was the buttons that were slashed
off; but that’s a mere variation. .. .C.R.: Quite right.

“boarcls” many years ago. Shortly after this

ney. But for one reason and another, the co. failed.

justice:—-
The drunkard burst around the room,
And with an oath grabbed the carpet broom;
He laughed as he broke it ’cross his knee.
“This ruddy thing is much too light for me.”
One bound, the rocking-chair he caught
And grabbing that his wife he sought.
He grabbed her from a corner and flung her ’gainst
the door,
And caught her by the hair ’ere she reached the floor.
He raised the rocking-chair and hit her on the head,
And dropped her there, and kicked her, and then
he went to bed.
Next morning he awoke and said, “Where is my wife?
I think she must be hurt. I hope she isn’t. O my
life!”
He rushed into the kitchen, and saw her stiffened
corpse.
He Kneed his head, and wept, and prayed in his
remorse.
“O well,” he said, “if ! wish to cheat a rope
I’ll fly quickly, and silently : it is my only hope.”
He rushed to the back, took the fence in a bound,
But in the paddock next door an angry bull he
found.
It rushed him, and it gored him, and left him on the
sod,
A witness to the vengeance that only comes from God.
....Rose B.: Not suitable.... A. D. (Camberwell): A

“Womba”: Prison labor is put to some
novel uses in Broome (W.A.), where native
malefactors, when outside the gaol, are
chained together in pairs. When the floor
of the local hall needs preparation for a
dance, a warder and a gang of about six
pairs of binghis are engaged. The darkies
drag bags filled with sand over the floor for
a day, the charge being the payment of the
warder’s wages for that time. Broome is
famous for its dancing floors*
“Phoney” : There are still five miners on
the once-famous Ebagoolah goldfield, Cape
York Peninsula (Q.), and their ages total
350 years. They can still do a day’s toil,
and were well enough to ride their horses
into the recent Coen amateur picnic meeting.
By the way, this must be the most northerly
meeting of its kind in Australia. It is no-
thing to bring the grass-feds 70 miles to com-
pete. There are no bookies —only a tote
which returned the solitary investor in the
P.lrtokboyw’ Itaee for bis dollar,

Why this Burroughs will
make more money for You!
You have undoubtedly thought many times that a Burroughs Add-
ing Machine might help you in your business —especially when an
unusual amount of figure work piled up. But you have hesitated
about buying one until your business grew larger, and you had more
figuring to do.
The longer you wait before purchasing a Burroughs, the more
money you lose. This is true whether you run a large business or
a small business.
A Burroughs will make more money for you because:
It will save time by enabling you to handle all of your figures
quickly—and time is money.
It will protect your profit by giving you the correct result of
all of your figuring problems —and this, too, means money.
Here is an opportunity to determine right now- —without one cent
of cost to you, and without the slightest obligation, whether or not
a Burroughs can help you make and save more money.
Just sign and mail the coupon below. A Burroughs representative
will bring one of the many styles of Burroughs Adding and Listing
Machines to your place of business —demonstrate how it will handle
your figure work, and show how it will save time and money for you.
The Burroughs was the first practical adding and listing machine
invented and placed on the market. That was forty years ago.
Today, Burroughs is the largest manufacturer of Adding, Book-
keeping and Calculating Machines in the world, and is the
accepted standard for figuring machines.

“Half-Moon”: Beef at Thirsty Island is
from 60 to 100 per cent, dearer than it is
anywhere else in Queensland. Tired of im-
portuning the Prices Commissioner, people
are taking to dugong and turtle, in addition
to fish. The flesh of the two former is very
palatable, and requires less energy in chew-
ing than the butcher’s joints.

“Bill Beetlecruslier” : A hostile communica-
tion recently forwarded to the Deputy-Post-
master-General, Sydney, by an “allowance”
postmaster: “Dear Sir, —I have wrote to
your store for ink and string four or five
times now. If you don’t send it by return
of post I’ll chuck the damn post office
through the window. The aforesaid post
office is only a date-stamp and a mail-advice,
so the job won’t take long.”
“Coot” : Some of the regrets recently ex-
pressed for the cheap meals of vanished years
remind me that my first Bulletin contribu-
tion (about 27 years ago) was concerning
three restaurants in Bourke-street, Mel-
bourne, which supplied a three-course dinner
for 4d. To write that par. I sampled the
bill-of-fare at each hash-house. All supplied
full and plenty, and at each I was offered
a second helping of pudding. Nor was there,
any limit to the bread and butter and tea
that might be consumed.
* * * *
“Shed Hand” : I once worked with a rail-
way gang that methodically picked the eyes
out of goods passing through their hands;
to go against them was to risk a crack on
the head. One day the whisper “Silver-
plate!” brought suppressed excitement, and
hastily a haul was planned. When we were
at our posts, fan-wise in commanding posi-
tions, the chief operator got to work. Fif-
teen minutes passed, and he appeared with
a face as red as a Bolshevik. “A gutzer!”
lie spat out. “Coffin fittings!”
“Abbot Park” : W. J. Farrell, an English
maker of musical instruments, is employing
for violins and violas a combination of tim-
bers which in his opinion has no equal—•
Queensland maple for backs and red cedar
for fronts. He says there are about 10
varieties of Australian timbers suitable for
bow sticks, a Tasmanian blackwood being
specially recommended. John Devereux. an
instrument-maker who flourished in Mel-
bourne 60 years ago, used local wood in his
work, and some of his violins are still fine
in tone.
* # * *
“F.L.H.” : The one-time Melbourne pilot
service schooner Haw r k, after many years of
good work, is likely to finish her days cray-
fishing at Westernport (Vic.). Built in
Maoriland over 40 years ago, she was a
finely-designed craft; from the year ’B9, when
she was bought for the Port Phillip pilots, to
her sale 15 years afterwards, when steam
superseded sailing power, she never suffered
a mishap in all the heavy weather she en-
countered. In those days it was sometimes
difficult to put a pilot on board a vessel at
all, and the little Hawk had to sail in ahead,
leading the way through the channel, and
then get herself out again. She never failed.
“Hamer” : The Daw has been fingering its
chin over the slot-machines that are growing
more numerous in Melbourne. Though there
is an obvious difficulty about arresting them for
selling goods after hours, the Law did its best
by trying to secure convictions against cer-
tain traders who had installed cigarette slot-
machines outside their premises. The result
was a perfectly sane magisterial conclusion
that a slot-machine is not a shop or factory
within the meaning of the Act. Now the
State Government intends to intervene.
Lemmon has announced that in amending
factory legislation the slot-machine will be
either prohibited altogether or severely regu-
lated—he has a vision of after-hours beer
being obtainable for sixpence in the slot.
“Amico”: Queensland a while ago had a
queer instance of a will that kicked. A farmer,
a staunch Methodist, made his own last
testament, leaving all his property to his
wife and children in certain proportions. But,
inasmuch as his wife had been before mar-
riage a Roman Catholic (she had ’verted on
marrying), he added a stipulation that no
person of that faith should benefit. Evi-
dently he didn't contemplate the possibility
of his wife returning to her old faith; any-
how, he made no provision for the distribu-
tion of his estate in the event of such a con-
tingency. Yet this is precisely what the lady
did during the testator’s last illness, taking
her children with her into the R.C. fold. This
had the effect of voiding the will and creating
an intestacy, with the result that letters of
administration were granted to the widow,
and the property was divided according to the
law, i.e., one-third to the widow, and two-
thirds amongst the children.
* * * *
On a Speck spec:—
Gerald Mussen’s purchase of the Speck assets of
the V.D.L. Co. for £325,000 places the Baillieu
bunch in possession of the most historic plot of land
in the Small State. It is just a century since the
V.D.L. Co. secured a Royal Charter for the selection
of half a million acres in the little known North-
West of the island, and took up, for a start, 150,000
acres at Surrey Hills—a block which only missed
Mi. Hischoff by a mile or two. The main object of
the new owners of the V.D.L. areas is said to be the
manufacture of wood pulp by chemical, and possibly
mechanical, methods. General-man iger Butters, of
the State Hydro-Electric Department, reckons that the
paper people will want at least 4000 or 5000 e.h.p.
of the juice he sells. But distance from the existing
State source may result in a separate power scheme
on the Arthur River if paper mills are actually set
up on the North-West Coast. It is believed that the
wood-pulp part of the venture (there is already a Brick
and Timber Co. operating on, and included in, the
property) largely depends on whether European paper
manufacturers are willing to back the scheme. Recent
investigations made by Amalgamated Zinc, in co-
operation with the Commonwealth Bureau of Science
and Industry, leave no doubt that paper “rather too
good for newsprint” can be made at a profit from
Tas. hardwood plus one-third imported soft-wood
pulp. It is reckoned that a capital of £1,000,000
would establish works capable of supplying one-third
of the requirements of Australian newspapers at a
very early date, with a prospect of vastly increased
output and profit in 10 or 15 years, when the pro-
posed spruce plantations are ready for the axe.

Senator Stephen Barker, who died two
months ago, left f. 2326 to his children. It
was mostly real property.
With the passing of 90-year-old John
Hamilton, merchant, at Hobart, the Speck
has lost its last constant wearer of the shiny
tall hat.
When Barstow, Sergcant-at-Arms, retires
from the Vic. Assembly he will have at least
one grateful recollection of the Labor Gov-
ernment. It made him a J.P.
“H.K.” : Apropos early collections of wild
animals. The genesis of the menagerie m
Australia was a tiger in a cage, exhibited at
the corner of Hunter and Castlereagli streets,
Sydney, in 1533. A peep was obtainable for
a sprat.
Six of the oldest inhabitants of the
Hawkesbury (N.S.W.) died in one
week: their ages totalled 487 years. Ihe
oldest was John Pearce, of Agnes Banks,
92; Thomas Kemp, of Windsor, the
youngling of the flock, was cut off at an
untimely 71.
A. A. Billson having been re-elected Chair-
man of Committees of Vic. Assembly, lie will
draw pay as though he had been chairman
ever since Parliament was dissolved three
months ago. The amiable custom in the
southern State is that when a Speaker or
Chairman of Committees is re-elected no
break is made in the payment of salary.
“Blank File” : Whilst excavating and re-
moving the bodies from old St. David s
Cemetery, Hobart, the workers came on a
skeleton with an ordinary breakfast-plate
white with raised blue figuring—resting on
the breast. According to the headstone the
deceased was a master mariner. Can anyone
say if the emblem has any significance in
nautical tradition?
“Landa” : My entry for the Perseverance
Stakes. At Bright, in the Ovens Valley
(Vic.), an old miner started to drive a tunnel
into a hill to intersect the Mystery reef. He
worked single-handed with pick and shovel,
and carried out every bit of mullock in a
leather apron. He kept at the job for close
up 20 years, and when old age heat him his
tunnel was almost a mile into the hill.
“Croson”: Curious house names? Years
ago a neat villa in Oakleigh, outside,,Mel-
bourne, wore the name “Stone Broke.” It
probably met the case, as it was in the days
after the land boom. Later on a country
home a few miles further out, bore on the
front gate the hospitable intimation “Ave
Viator.” I cannot say if any passing swaggie
ever took advantage of the invitation.
“Lond.”: Edward Lucas, Agent-General
for S.A., acknowledges in London Daily
Mail the “courtesy of Englishmen towards
their kinsmen overseas” on an odd but in-
teresting point. Sundry Australian visitors
wanted to hear the nightingale. Lucas made
known the want, and received fully 80 re-
plies from country residents anxious to assist
in meeting it, quite a number offering to put
visitors up for the night.
Alfred Tyer, born in Berkshire 83 years
ago, died at Featherston (M.L.) the other
day, after 63 years’ strenuous pioneering. He
was a grandnephew of Sir John Musgrove,
an original director of the old N.Z. Land-Co.,
helped to survey Invercargill town site, and,
among other things, had been a gold-digger,
fellmonger and tanner. In the early ’sixties
he was the first to machine-scour wool and
to ship “pickled” pelts to England.
Gone where the good sailors go, Capt.
John Caleb Thomas, born in Devonshire 75
years ago, and skipper of the old City of
Athens when she put up a long-standing
London-to-Calcutta record. Later he was
with the N.Y.K. and the Royal Mail Steam
Packet lines, and steered courses until 1912,
when he retired with his sons to an orchard
on the West Tamar (Tas.). One of the
sons, Percy, is now the Speck’s Government
fruit expert.
“A political scandal of the first magni-
tude” is said to have arisen in France
through a member (one of the Rothschilds)
being accused of buying votes. He is said
to have no politics and no axe to grind, hut
a giddy fancy for trying public life. A
stunned Law Department is prosecuting him.
Australia takes the world less seriously.
Labor politicians have testified that mem-
bers of their party, in this legislature or
that, but especially in N.S.W., got their seats
by bribery, corruption, ballot-stuffing and
mixed villainy. And the Government hasn’t
turned a hair.
“The Oldest”: The “Brief Historical
Sketch” of Parliamentary Government in N.
S. Wales, by W. Kenneth Charlton, second
clerk in the Leg. Council, is a neatly-
got-up souvenir of the centenary of
the State’s Parliament. But the pic-
ture it contains of a hut which stood
where Vickery’s Buildings are to-day, and
which is labelled “the first Government
House,” conveys the erroneous impression
that this was where Brisbane called his first
Councillors together. In Brisbane’s time —
in fact, from Phillip’s time up to that of
Gipps—Government House stood on the
corner of the Phillip and Bridge streets of
to-day. I have a fine old-time colored litho-
graph of the house; the original was done in
1805 by George William Evans, the surveyor.
“M.”: The approaching Hume centenary
has evoked a variety of proposals for honor-
ing the explorer’s memory, including a grand
procession of motor-cars and Fords from
Albury to Corio Bay, led by the irrepressible
Dr. James Barrett. Could any more fitting
tribute be paid to Hume’s great achievement
than the restoration of his name to the map
of Australia? The river he crossed in 1824
and named after his father would still be
the Hume but for a subsequent explorer’s
mistake and some official sycophancy char-
acteristic of the period. Six years after
Ilume, Sturt arrived at the same river, and,
thinking he had made a new discovery, con-
ferred on it the name of Sir George Murray,
a fine old British Tory who never set foot
in Australia, or showed any particular in-
terest in it beyond advocating a continuance
of the convict system. On the other hand,
Hume was a native-born Australian who,
apart from his famous trek of 1824, ren-
dered notably important services to the land
of his birth. It is not too late to do Hume’s
name the measure of justice suggested. The
decision rests mainly with Premier Fuller
and his colleagues, the river, from its source
to the S.A. border being wholly within the
territorial jurisdiction of N. S. Wales.

The New Triangular Stick.
Makes Shaving a Pleasure !
In half a minute Rexona Shaving Soap softens the beard,
and the lather will remain on the face with all its softness for
twelve minutes. But Rexona shavers do not require this, for
Rexona Shaving Soap makes the beard so soft that a Rexona
shave really takes not more than two minutes.
A Rexona shave is a luxuriant yet an economical shave, for
the lather is over 1 50 times as great as the Soap used, and a 1/6
triangular stick is sufficient to last the average man at least 150
shaves, which makes over eight shaves for a penny. Then, too,
consider how much easier Rexona Shaving Soap makes the beard
on the razor, and how soft, smooth and antiseptic it leaves the
skin, and protects it from all weather conditions. Being an
antiseptic Medicated Soap, it has a
tendency to quickly heal any cut
you may have the misfortune to get,
and if troubled with pimples and
blotches of any kind, will daily tend
to remove them.

Gaston of the Beard.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FRENCH Gaston from his roving,
With merry eyes a-gleam,
Arrived at Auckland Harbor
Casts anchor in the stream.
And by his side Pamea
Looks wondering on the town —
His child of Polynesia,
A Venus lithe and brown.
“From this day forth,” he muses,
“The newer life begins.
A child in every island! —
Lord, I enjoyed my sins!
“There, where the cherries blossom,
In little old Japan,
A mild-eyed geisha nurses
Our little sailor-man.
“Slant-eyed, straight-haired and whiter
Than the Mikado’s sons—
Half-bred, yet blood of Vikings
Through every pulse-loclc runs.
“And there in Raratonga,
Penang and Singapore.
From Darwin to Dunedin.
Are waifs on sea and shore.
“One chases moths in Java,
One dives in pearl-paved seas,
One loafs in Honolulu,
One in the Celebes.
“A child in every island—
A love child roughly reared—
Lord, what a royal family
lias Gaston of the Beard!
“Far north, far north, in Iceland,
And by the North-West Gate.
In lands of little promise
French Gaston found a mate.
“Twas warm within the igloo
Clamped fast to Arctic snow—
The musk ox on the mainland,
The white bear on the floe.
“The yellow blubber spluttered
Beneath the reeking flame :
And warmly couched beside me
The once wild Lap lay tame.
“We shot the whiskered walrus,
We clubbed the drowsing seal,
We watched the mad aurora
Round the horizon wheel.
“My fond Ayesha sorrowed
An hour as Spring appeared.
And through the crumbling ice-crust
The prow of Gaston sheared
“From Circle to Equator
The trail of love ran down
By many a cove uncharted
And many a harbored town.
“Old heavens sank behind us,
New heavens rose before,
With women brown and wifely
On many a palmy shore.
“My sins were few and simple,
My passions manly-mild ;
Only on every island
Lives a berserker’s child.”
* ' * •
Now laughs no more the rover
Where he has gone below.
For one has plainly shown him
Seven blotches white as snow.
Seven blotches, seven devils
Of etching leprosy!
Nor may he make a landing,
Nor dare he put to sea.
Yet once again the Viking
Laughs loud his deep 110 ! Ho!—
"In scorn of these 'white devils
Once more to sea I go.
“My sins were small transgressions,
Great joy of them had I:
Not caged with scaly Lazars
Shall bearded Gaston die.”
Blue tides on Waitemata
T Run neither fast nor slon r ;
Yet down past Rangitoto.
Borne lightly on their flow,
Adrift, adrift and seaward,
Mateless, alone, unsteered.
Sunk with his seven blotches,
Goes Gaston of the Beard!
IIAORILAND.
DARIUS.
Over There.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OTTHEX T was in America I experi-
y W enccd genuine poverty; and, look-
ing restrospectively towards that
time, it seems as though 1 had observed a
crack in the earth which the tiniest shake
might have widened into a grave to swallow
me up. That is, of course, an exaggerated
feeling—a nervous vibration running through
the body after danger is over. At any rate
I was without fear during the period of my
trial. To live on air is to caper on air,
and when the “great starve” approached it
found me, uncannily happy; light in the
head and light in tiie heels. I had had no
food, so there was no poison in my veins. The
New York winter atmosphere (it registered
42 degrees below zero, and I wore a summer
suit without an overcoat) lifted me, in my
imagination, at least three feet above the
board-walk, and I moved very rapidly, like
a man swung from a wire, scarcely able to
touch the earth with my toes. The elevated-
railway was my companion-dragon, and I
would watch it from an isolated but near-
by position, turning its scales in the upper
darkness, of Columbus Circle —then, when it
was vanishing, I would endeavor to fly after
it. People in the street never seemed to be
aware of ray presence. I was too frail, too
insubstantial, to admit of any mortal valua-
tion. But. on the other hand, I was greatly
heartened by the bustling activity of the
crowd. Their sharp black eves were full
of significance for me. The whiffs of petrol,
the everlasting reek of Turkish tobacco, the
peculiar standardisation of men's clothes
(especially of hats), their nn-Englisli women,
their cabarets, their chop-suey joints, then-
delicatessens, their roof-gardens, their lights
running like drops of quicksilver over every-
thing—all these charged me with the madness
of life. I thrilled in Broadway, while 1
touched flaccidity in the hideous bareness of
a "hall-bedroom" where I hung my shell by
night.
Continuing in this estate I noticed voices
increased their volume and colors their bright-
ness. In fact, there was a general quickening of
perception on the part of all the senses. Every
quality, mental or physical, was intensified.
Fat men bulged enormously, and kind ones
radiated smiles in the same way that a
bicycle-wheel radiates spokes. During that
period 1 don’t remember having once walked
up the steps leading to the “front por-rcli” ;
I’m not quite sure, but I think I always flew
over the face of the building until I found
my proper floor, after which it became easy
to single out the room I occupied. Once 1
touched the sill it was but a step to reach
the carpet. Too feverish to write or read, 1
talked at the ceiling; I put out my hand
against the beam of advertisement light
which flashed across my mirror, imagined l
held it, and snatched at it again when it
jumped through the window. This window
was never closed, and I was equally Spartan
with regard to my radiator. One night I
awoke to find myself covered with snow; but
the experience proved infinitely more pleasant
than the black dip I took every morning in
a coffin called “the bath," which was so
cramped for space that the door opening on
it would never go further than half-way. I
attribute a great deal of my strength at that
period to the rigorous laws I made for my-
self. At any rate 1 astonished the natives.
(I am speaking now of \Vest-4(stli-street,
midwinter, 1915.) •
Dancing along, then, with a white moon in
the sky, I am prepared to swear that there
was not another window, of all the rows on
either side, whichever way you looked, so
perpetually open as mine. N’Yorkers of
those days (and, I suppose, of these, too)
took their winters airlessly, with radiators
going full blast, and kept themselves her-
metically sealed in their rooms; so that, if
you opened a door, the heat which rushed
upon you sickened you. It was Brother
Jonathan’s habit; and very often, after an
hour or two in his steam-heated flat, he would
o-rise, and, walking a couple of blocks
through snow and sleet, pass at last into a
biassing cafe (pub) and there suck up many
iced drinks. And so again into the wind,
which undressed him. and cut into his bones
like a scythe. On the next day lie usually
died. He was helped into his evening-suit
for the last time. The barber painted his
face and curled his moustache: and then the
American equivalent to Mr. Mould carried
him away.
As for myself, I was voted mad; but it
was a madness that kept me alive.
On Christmas Eve an Australian called on
me. lie was only in New York for a day,
and, without having any knowledge of my
circumstances, asked me to dine with him.
I had a long march, I remember, to get to his
lodgings; and, after 1 had arrived there, a
devil of a time to wait before I could see him.
Dinner followed, and I recollect hors-d’auvre,
crepincttex de volatile aux champignons,
rump steak, stuffed olives, plum-pudding,
red wine. But, to my surprise, I was un-
able to eat, or. at least, only carefully, and
with a difficulty about swallowing; after-
wards, while I walked home through Broad-
way in the snow, I felt unconscionably ill.
At every corner I encountered men dressed,
to represent Father Christmas, in artificial
beards and geranium-colored coats ; they were
stationed beside cardboard chimneys and rang
tinkling little bells. Or, perhaps, instead of
a man, it might be a woman attired in scar-
let, and wearing a high coAvl-like cap; she
invariably stood over a wire-covered cauldron
suspended from three sticks joined together
at the top, and never would she halt in the
task of shaking her maddening brass bell.
These bells filled the air with their noise
for miles, the snow having stopped all sounds
of traffic: and, penniless as I was, I couldn’t
help feeling ashamed while I dodged from
one Santa Claus to another without putting
a coin into his pot or chimney, because every
cent meant a cake and a cup of coffee for the
poor of New York.
* * * *
One night, on leaving my lodgings, I had
mechanically picked up, from among a mass
of letters on the hall table, a Bulletin
directed to myself: and now, as I wandered
through the crowd, somebody seeing the
bright-covered paper under my arm came
rushing towards me with a cry of “Bondi, you
beggar!”
“Bondi!” I repeated; “Manly! Coogee!
Deepwater!”
“Glad to meet you,” continued my new-
found friend, whom I didn’t know from a
crow. “I remember those places well. See
you again some day.”
Then, with a warm shake of the hand, lie
slipped back to his companions and, flop-
ping into a cafe, went out of my life for
ever.
It was like the appearance and disappear-
ance of Harlequin in a pantomime. Thence-
forth I waxed melancholy. To tell the truth
I shed more un virofitable tears as a result of
this stroke of chance-medley than I had kept
back during the whole of my previous soli-
tude. The lovely bays of Sydneyside lay
tugging at my heart; and the mere mention
of Manly and Bondi filled me with a poig-
nant desire to be home again. Their names
stuck like sorrow in my throat. They had
exactly the same effect upon me as the play-
ing of the “Rons de Vaclics ” is said to have
produced upon the minds of the exiled Swiss.
(Rousseau, in his “Dictionary of Music,”
makes the statement that whenever this air
was played by the Swiss Regimental Band
in the service of France, the soldiers became
seized with so vehement a passion for their
native land that its further performance was
prohibited under pain of death.)
Nor was I the only sufferer from this
cause. Jimmy Ryan was then in New York,
and although he kept a stiff upper lip he
Mould often say to me, “Never speak about
over there.” His “over there” was made of
the beaches, the gardens and the little coun-
try places like Narellan, in New South
Wales, where he came from. And yet to
see him five minutes afterwards one would

quickest, surest way to perfect skin health.
PAINFUL SPRING BOILS BANISHED.
“I was suffering from an attack of irritating and painful
boils,’’ says Miss M. Sidoti, 5 1 Arthur Street, Lavender Bay,
North Sydney, “which extended from my arms over consider-
able portion of my back. Although under medical advice, my
complaint showed no improvement, the only apparent result
being that the boils broke out again in different portions of
my body.
“After having decided to use Zam-Buk I found that the
first application of this balm brought immediate relief from
the itching and irritation I had previously endured. Within
one week from that time I am glad to say that I was completely
rid of this disfiguring skin disorder. The swellings subsided,
and new healthy skin had replaced them.”
For eczema, pimples, boils, abscesses, ringworm, poisoned
wounds, cuts, burns or for piles, Zam-Buk provides the unrivalled
remedy. You should also wash with Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap,
excellent for bath and toilet ,(1/- per tablet —2/10 per box of
three).

imagine that New York was in sole posses-
sion of his heart.
This experience of a mutual weakness
brought us wonderfully together; and often
I have discovered Jimmy looking at me with
a mind full of anxiety, as if he were doubt-
ful how I would be taking it. And some-
times I would try to test Jim's fibre when
he might be off his guard. But he was never
off it.
He took me one Saturday afternoon for
a mysterious walk. He said he had some-
thing to show me—something he was sure
I should like very much, but beyond that
there was little to be got out of him.
In order to reach this miracle it became
necessary to traverse all sorts of byways:
and so for the best part of an hour we
went trapsing along sunken fences, crossing
shattered courtyards, going under arches,
over bridges, and continually turning up
closer to the river. At last we came to a
full stop, where a barrier, higher than our
heads, shut us off sharp on the edge of
the Hudson.
Piling boxes in a heap, I helped Jimmy to
construct a temporary platform; and from
the crafty way in which he brought boards
and support-blocks to light, 1 knew he must
have been there previously. His hands were
trembling as he put them out to steady the
structure in anticipation of the ascent, and
then, suddenly, he was gone.
Meanwhile. I stayed below, watching in
vain for the signal which should give me
leave to follow him.
For a long time he stood motionless, his
eyes fixed in a patient stare across the water.
Then at last a gleam of light burned through
a cloud and showed the fleeting sun ; but how
cold, and without rays !
“Now!” exclaimed Jim.
I was with him in a moment. “Sydney!
Sydney!.... Oh, my Sydney! he cried.
"Look, Ilugliie! Doesn't it take you back
. ...over there?”
1 tried to see with his eyes, but I
couldn’t. Both our affections were so great
■—in different bounds. .Tim conjured up. and
imagined, while I. less fortunate, only re-
membered. Thereupon the thought occurred:
“I have to remain in exile barely 12 more
grinding months in order to become like
him.’’
This flat, stagnant waste, then, having the
appearance of a rubbed and frosted window,
represented for Jim the quiet, ferry-twinkled
waters of our city in the South. He told
me afterwards he went there every holiday.
If w T as Jim’s secret. He had been away from
home longer than I.
HUGH McCRAE.
Rose Park.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU must understand, to start with,
that what used to be Rose Park
is now called Toorak. I don’t mean
the Toorak of Melbourne, which is a suburb
of fairly ancient traditions, but the brand-
new upstart near Adelaide, the delight of
agents because of its soaring land values
and the bane of postmen because of its
plagiarised name, Being in Adelaide for a
few days after an absence of nearly twenty
years, I thought I would like to have a look
at the house where 1 was born. In my child-
hood it stood amongst a handful of other
houses, in the north-west corner of a wheat-
field which stretched for nearly a mile square,
from the Britannia Hotel (now the Hotel
Britannia) southwards to the Lunatic
Asylum (now the Mental Hospital) and east-
wards to the foot of the Adelaide hills. The
State School and the Congregational Church
stood like oases in the middle of the waving
wheat; the only other building on those sun-
washed acres was Prescott’s Farm. Twenty
years ago the area under wheat had shrunk
very little, and wheat was still being har-
vested there in the first years of the Great
War.
. To trace all the old landmarks l got out
of the tram at the top north-east corner of
Prescott's Farm. I walked along a beauti-
fully-metalled suburban street and found a
modern bungalow on the site of the clump of
gums that used to stand there, sculptured by
centuries of gully winds into as noble a com-
position as “Laocoon,” and certainly as
worthy to be preserved. The owner of the
villa was planting seeds from a packet
in a rectangular garden plot. I passed
the new bowling-club, where a mon-
strous blue-gum used to lie and under
which we used to hunt for centi-
pedes, and turned down a long street of
standardised new houses. Just here 1 got
bushed. All the distances seemed too short.
1 could see the racecourse grandstand poking-
over the roofs, and it seemed much too near.
The spire of the Congregational Church would
have given me my bearings, but there were
several spires ornamenting the skyline, and I
could not remember exactly what the Congre-
gational Church’s spire was like. I don’t
think I used to look very high in those days.
So I went into a new, neat shop on the cor-
ner of a block entirely occupied by four-
roomed cottages, and asked the shopman to put
me right. He appreciated my interest in his
progressive district, and came out into the
middle of the road to point out the various
places of interest. Over there was the
Masonic Hall. I only remembered follow-
ing reapers and binders in that direction.
Over there was the Mental Hospital, only
you couldn’t see it for the houses. The direc-
tor in his leisure moments, I remember, used
to study the intelligent activities of silk-
worms as an antidote to the observation of
human afflictions. Our maid-of-all-work —•
they earned the name in those days—used to
frighten me with tales of escapees instead of
ghost stories, and I was always, haunted by
the idea that there was one hiding behind the
rocking-chair in the dining-room, even when
the summer sun was streaming through the
windows.
Where was Prescott’s Pond? The shopman
pointed down the metalled road between
rows of houses that looked as if they had all
been built by the same contractor out of the
same heap of materials in a single night.
There it was, half inside the corner cottage
and half under the pavement and the surface
of the x-oad. We used to sail our model
yachts in that chocolate-colored pool, and got
great pleasure out of it. I made the bright
discovery that if 1 turned my back to the
pond and bent down so as to look between
my legs, the pond instantly took on the aspect
of an ocean fringed with spacious harbors
and backed by the volcanic hills of Prescott's
smoking manure-heaps, under which our ships
floated in all their pride; but it was a manoe-
uvre difficult to perform without attracting
notice, and I was afraid of my companions'
ridicule. One day the farmhand with the
curly brown beard and the long brown ring-
lets hanging to his shoulders, of whom we
were superstitiously afraid, confiscated our
ships because they got in amongst his ducks
and frightened them.
What had happened to the old farm? I
asked with a sinking heart. Oh, Prescott’s
Farm was still there, but it wouldn’t be there
for long. It was an eyesore, as 1 would
agree when I saw it. Bred rats and spoilt
the value of the beautiful properties around
it.
In the old days we used to be able just
to see the grey shingle roofs of Prescott’s
Farm from the schoolyard, like rocks or
islands in the, ocean of golden wheat. Now
it stood in a sea, an orderly sea, of tiled
roofs. The little old low cottage of creamy
grey Glen Osmond stone stood on the edge
of tin 1 asphalt pavement in a half-acre allot-
ment. The old well still remained alongside
the back verandah. A dusty vine drooped
over the gate, and one or two dwarf ligtrees
in a bare earth yard looked apologetically
across at the aristocratic gardens of im-
ported palms and well-ironed lawns on the
other side of the street. There was a heap
of old farming machinery in a corner, and a
broken wheel of titanic size leaning against
a shed whose shingles had long ago been
replaced by galvanised-iron. The coughing
of a small engine came from inside. A ruddy-
faced man was casting up accounts in a
little, tumbledown weatherboard office. I
recognised the family likeness in young Pres-
cott. His eyes gleamed like brown beads in
his broad Kentish face. He was a chaff-
miller now. and the hay he used to grow had
to bo brought by motor-lorries thirty or forty
miles to him. The business scarcely paid.
All the old family of five brothers and one
sister, whose parents had come out in the
’thirties, were dead. None of those uncles
and aunts of his had died under 70, and one
had lived to 92. They came of a durable
stock. Tenacious, land-loving. The love
of the land they worked, but were never able
to own, had been bred into their ancestors
for perhaps two thousand years. They
leased Rose Park from the South Australian
Co. about 1837, and they had worked it
ever since. They were separated from the
city in those days by two miles of heavy
bush, which shrouded from them the city’s
growth. It was not long before they saw
housed coming on their bush horizon. The
city reached out a feeler, and a road went
past them to the hills. Horse-trams ap-
peared on the road, a strange phenomenon.
Suburbs grew up around their frontiers.
The silhouette of gums changed to one of
houses. They went on farming wheat;
playing, without knowing it, their landlords’
game. They were making a bare living,
while the S. A. Co. was waiting for a for-
tune in unearned increment. The electric
trams came and they marvelled. The co.
began nibbling at their acres, but did not
reduce their rents as the area under bricks
and mortar increased.
They did not know what was happening
to them. They loved the land and they
worked it. The sister was not the marry-
ing sort. She remained single, after her
seventeenth year going no longer to the city;
and died at 85 without having seen Adelaide
again. The brothers married, but only one
of them, his father, had children. He had
19 to make up for the others' lack. The old
people died and the young ones drifted ofl.
He was the only one who stuck it out. lie
had had children, the fourth generation ou
that farm, but they were all gone too. There
was nothing else for them to do when the soil
was growing suburban villas. They still
loved the land, but there was not enough
of it now to give them a living.
Young Prescott’s smooth Kentish face be-
lied his 57 years, but there was trouble in his
bright brown eyes, He came out of his office
into the sunshine, and the bright eyes became
almost gloomy as they wandered over the
wilderness of roofs with which he was sur-
rounded. From where we stood, 20 years
ago one could see eastward right away to
the ranges, and on all four sides was wheat.
Now there were only houses. They were
like the rising tide. He had watched them
grow from that little patch in the norm-west
corner. Every year they grew. They came
at him from all sides. Soon they would be
right over him.
And now they said he was insanitary,
these pale suburbanites trotting off to work
every morning with their little bags of tomato
sandwiches and lettuce for their lunch which
they ate at their desks. For nigh on 40
years he had ploughed, planted and cropped
the ground where they now interred their
bulbs and mowed their little oblong patches
of grass. He had roofed himself and killed
his own meat, and sunk his own wells for
water, and kept his fields sweet without the
aid of drainage boards. Insanitary, they
called him !
He had watched the furniture moving in
and out of the houses, and “To Let" and
“For Sale" appear in the windows. It was
nearly 100 years since his family had moved
in in Rose Park. These people were as fickle
as bees. They hated and destroyed all the
old things—the old winding roads along
which his grand dad first.drove his stock, the
old gums, the old fences, the old houses. It
would be his turn next.
I had nothing to say to him. I was of
the new race too. I had come to look at n.y
own home which to him was just one of the
cells of this human beehive that had usurped
his father’s acres and whose purpose was a
mystery and whose activities bewildered him.
I took my leave of him and followed the
sound of children’s voices until I found the
old school, surrounded by houses instead of
wheat. A road ran over the collection of
mounds we used to call the blackfellows'
battleground. My old home seamed to have
shrunk to half its former size; the back yard
did not conform to my memory of it as a
spacious and lovely pleasaunce. The house
looked as if it had sunk at one corner and
might collapse at any moment, but in the
front garden the pomegranate-tree was still
bearing its useless fruit.

and time is money
The difference between a good battery and a better
battery is a matter of TIME.
Almost any battery will start and light your car for
a while. The proof of merit lies in the DURATION
pf this service,
Thousands of drivers will testify to the long life of
Exide Batteries, and not just long life but
CONTINUOUS service, with amazingly little inter-
ruption and expense through repairs.
It is this rugged tenacity of the Exide that makes it
such an economy. At the present low prices the
