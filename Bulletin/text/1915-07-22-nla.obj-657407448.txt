Jim
There is a kind of settled gloom —
A sort of all-day valley-mist —
That has a hold, in evert) room,
Like some unseen antagonist.
And all about the house and farm
The simple joys that were our wont
Have disappeared or lost their charm
Since Jim, our Jim, went to the Front.
I watched the wife awhile ago
Setting the table for our tea,
Deep lost in thought, with movements slow,
A place for her, a place for me,
And, as in days that have gone by,
The old accustomed place for Jim;
Then, with a smothered sob and sigh,
She stopped, and tried to joke of him.
Oh, she is brave! I’ve tried and tried
A hundred times to do the same,
And simulated joy and pride
That Jim, our Jim, had played the game;
And all the while my heart is sore,
And all the while I know that she
Prays for the only child she bore,
And adds a postcript prayer for me.
Last Sunday at the fall of night
Another to our fireside came,
And almost in a manner light
And frivolous she spoke his name.
“It's all right, dear old Mum,” she said,
‘‘Old Jimmcr knows a thing or two;
Don't you go worrying your head;
I know the old chap ivill pull through.”
But when I’d taken down the Book,
And read the lesson for the day,
She took in hers old hands that shook,
And knelt between us both to pray.
Then, to my heart of hearts I felt
The strong faith of her youth pass out,
And words forsook me as I knelt,
For I had deadened hope with doubt.
I know that sobs came to me there;
I know I trembled on my knees;
I know I stumbled through the prayer—
“Do with him, Lord God, as You please;
But keep him worthy of his race
And the traditions made for him.”
But she, with love-lights in her face,
Prayed simply—“ Make its worthy Jim.”
Still, there’s a kind of settled gloom —
A sort of dll-day valley-mist—
That’s got a hold, in every room,
Like some unseen antagonist.
And all about the house and farm
The simple joys that were our wont
Have disappeared or lost their charm,
Since Jim, our Jim, went to the Front.
E. S. EMERSON,
in “Melba’s Gift Book.”
Here it is, Melba's Gift Booh, published
by George Robertson, C.A., at 45., for the
Belgian Relief Fund. And a goodly offer-
ing of Australian art and literature, worth-
ily produced. Almost a hundred contribu-
tors, and most of them names well known
throughout Australia in their respective
arts. And the writers have not fobbed off
some second-rate thing as their gift: most
of them have given of their best. The
colored illustrations include Florence Rod-
way’s pastel portrait of Melba, Lambert’s
fine painting, “The Bathers,” a charming
Hans Heysen gum-tree, a Venetian
Streeton; some delightful etchings are
admirably reproduced; and the illustration
and decoration throughout are dignified and
Australian. , Such a book, produced so
artistically and for such an object, should
have a huge sale in Australia, while as a
present to overseas friends it should come
as a revelation of Australia’s - contribution
to arts and letters.
The Grinning Skull of
German Culture
Ford Madox Hueffer has some curiou
qualifications for his elaborate analysis
Prussian Culture, entitled When Blood
their Argument (Hodder and Stoughton, pe
Dymock’s Library) ; for his father was o
South German origin, his grandfather wa
more French than English, and Hueffer con
fesses that he thinks indifferently in French
German or English. His charge agains
Prussian culture, which he amiably con
fesses he hates, is that it is materialist, tha
all it aims at is the production of “mono
maniacs interested in their special subjects,
not of the all-round man. “I can only pei
ceive that the Anglo-Saxon- and Latin civil
isations have for the last 40 years been
browbeaten into timidity by the formidabl
productions of an alien barbarism.” Hueffe
advances a new and plausible theory for Ger-
many's insistence upon war: her poverty.
"The financial strain in German society
as I observed it during the last three or four
years, appeared to be so terrible and so
wearying that I can imagine the German
business man consenting almost with a sigh
of relief to be plunged into war in order to
get some rest and in the hope of ultimate
national profit ensuing.” Apparently the
German business man took to war as one
takes to a rest-cure: he was bound to go
bankrupt without a war —so why not gamble
on the chance of thumping indemnities that
would set everybody on their legs again?
“National organisation is no doubt a very
splendid thing, but when the individuals who
are working national institutions are
wretched beings, leading anxious lives at the
very edges of their income, with wives re-
duced to the level of desperate cooks, and
children horribly over-driven by the mad
necessity of acquiring philological facts suffi-
cient to qualify them for similar desperate
careers, the whole life passing in an atmo-
sphere of backbiting, of personal reports,
under the shadow of a Minister who may he
swayed by any kind of personal caprice in
the sovereign, the whole nation will be
wrought up to a pitch of strain and tension
and agony such as must almost inevitably
render that nation a hell to itself and a
danger to the rest of the inhabited world.”
Germany came to the banquet of the
world too late. She was the last of the
nations to enter the industrial field, to
become urban. Consequently, though she
is an expert in town-planning, she hasn’t had
time to put down decent drains. Germany is
the young man in a hurry, now attempting
hurriedly to gobble things like empire, cul-
ture and world-dominion. “Prussia was,
until a very late date, an exceedingly poorj
an exceedingly hungry, and an almost en-
tirely uncivilised State.” Germany grew
conscious of wealth, conscious enough to de-
mand wealth in immense quantities; “it
desired wealth with such avidity that it
abandoned all ideas of commercial morality;
it desired to impress the world with the idea
of the wealth that it did not possess to such
an extent that bitterness and stress entered
every household in Germany.” It is this bit-
terness that Hueffer rightly emphasises:
“The bitter, vigorous and obscene drawings
of SimplicissimtjS, the bitter and terrifying
lyrics of the most modern German poets, and
tne incredibly filthy—the absolutely incredi-
bly filthy—rproductions of the German variety
stage.
“Imagine, then, this population whose cul-
tural high-lights—for the bitter poems and
the bitter drawings, and even the obscenities
are things of an amazing cleverness —imag-
ine this embittered population whose cultural
nigh-lights are all products of malignity—this
population filled with megalomania by the
traditions of 1870 and the writings of Wag-
nei ’ > inspired to a religion of materialism
and of egotism by misreading the writings of
Isietzsche—this_ population without rest,
without joy, without ease, and without any
ceasing from the passion for money! Imag-
nm then this population preached to by
officials, preached to by the entire State, by
the entire professoriate, preached to inces-
santiy day in, day out, year in, year out, to
the effect that the only means of getting
rich is waging war. That was modern Ger-
many until August 4, 1914.”
What else could Germany be when Ger-
man professors teach that “Prance has be-
come a nation exclusively of decadent forni-
cators ; and that... .Great Britain has be-
came a country of decadents, expert in
nothing but the practice of unnatural vice.”
Hueffer offers to furnish the names of Ger-
man professors who have made this exact
charge. And the German professor has to
say what the State tells him to say—or lose
his job. The German universities, as Hueffer
conscientiously shows, constitute an organ-
ism in the world of culture “more powerful
in its influence on the human habit of mind
than any that has existed since the
Church of Home lost her absolute
spiritual dominion over Christendom.”
The present Emperor himself delivered
a remarkable speech, in which he in-
sisted that “the teachers of Germany have
only two functions—that of delivering into
my hands physically well-trained and morally
well-disciplined young men who may become
my soldiers, and that of so instructing them
that social democratic ideas shall be entirely
stamped out of the minds of the German
manhood of the future.” Not in so many
words, of course, but with just that emphasis
and masmmess. So bitter is the poverty
of Germany that a youth selecting an acad-
emic career, the crown of which is a pro-
fessorship, has no reasonable prospect of
maintaining himself, let alone marrying, be-
fore he has reached the age of 40. And there
are no scholarships—at least, none much
above £l5 per annum—for, above all, the
poorer classes, no matter how talented, must
not rub shoulders with the bureaucrats.
J*
One of the most delightful chapters
describes how Goethe was foisted upon Ger-
many and the world as a genius. The young
nation in a hurry had to have a genius—a
writer who should stand for Germany as
Shakespeare stands for England, Dante for
Italy, and Homer and JEscliylus for ancient
Greece. And, lacking a real superman, the
Minister of Education decided to put Goethe
on a world-pedestal. It was a rather diffi-
cult job, since between 1840 and 1870 Goethe
was regarded by German literati as a writer
of great merit—as a German Wordsworth—
the producer of some beautiful love poetry,
and a rather quaint theatre director—no
more. From 1856 for nearly 20 years the
public interest in Goethe had died out. But
in 1876 the cult was brilliantly started,
h alk, the then Minister of Education, made
a speech to the effect that the study of
Goethe must be regarded as on a par with
the study of the teachings of our Lord’ A
docile professor went further. He said that
the house in which Goethe was born should
stand near or be regarded as a little higher
than the manger of Bethlehem! Immense
biographies of the hero soon appeared,
written by professors whose only chance of
preferment lay in obtaining the favor of
Cabinet Ministers. And the world, obsessed,
as usual, by Germany’s gigantic bluff of cul-
ture, accepted the Goethe legend.
Henry James James writes asking this
page to mention that The Double-Bed Dia-
logues will be published shortly in book-
form by the N.S.W. Bookstall Co. Most of
these dialogues have appeared in this paper.

Biography
Wells
Two volumes of Hurried Biography for the
Million have been issued in Nisbet’s shilling
“Writers of the Day” series. Wells and
Bennett are naturally the two writers
chosen. The volumes are admirably written,
and despite the limitation of space the
ground is adequately covered for the not-
too-ambitious purpose of the series.
J. D. Beresford, the author of Goslings,
in H. G. Wells points out that if Wells had
been born into the leisured classes, instead
of the shop-keeping classes, “he would prob-
ably have written polite essays or a history
of Napoleon, during the intervals of his
leisured activity as a member of the Upper
House.” And Beresford stresses, as this
page long ago stressed, the absolutely normal
quality of Wells’ vision, undisturbed by the
precepts and dogmas of his parents, teachers
and early companions. In fact, Beresford
sees in his author’s romances the plain mes-
sage of the necessity for ridding the mind of
traditions and the hypnotic suggestions of
parents and guardians. Incidentally this
page welcomes the opinion of Beresford that
Lady Harman, in The Wife of Sir Isaac
Ilarman, “turned down” the foolish Brumley
in that delightful last scene of the kisses. A
correspondent expressed the opinion that
Lady Harman, as he read the passage, had
made up her mind to marry Brumley.
And as Wells is alive, Beresford 'warns us
that Wells will go on maturing his ideas just
as long as he continues mentally to grow.
“Should he ever adopt an inalterable policy,
subscribe to some ‘ism,’ and wear a label, he
would brand himself truly as inconsistent.”
Wells’s primary function is to suggest, to
throw out ideas —rather ragged at the edges
—that will set our brains working. Finallv,
Beresford feels no shade of hesitation in
characterising-Wells as a great writer. “He
alone has used his perfected art for a definite
end. He has not been content to record his
observations of the world as he has seen it,
to elaborate this or that analysis of human
motive, or to relate the history of a few
selected lives; he has done all this, but he
has done infinitely more by pointing out the
possible road of our endeavor. Through all
his work moves the urgency of one who
would create something more than a mere
work of art. . . .Ilis chief achievement is that
he has set up an ideal of a finer civilisation,
of a more generous life than that in which
we live.” _ And Wells is sane enough to
know that ideals are things with which one
never quite catches up.
Bennett
F. J. Harvey Darton’s biography of Arnold
Bennett is less illuminative —probably be-
cause Bennett is not Wells. Enoch Arnold
Bennett was born, of course, in “The Five
Towns,” and mentally has never left them. He
was educated there, matriculated at London
University, and returned to study law in the
office of his father, a solicitor. He ventured
to London, entered a solicitor’s office, found
that he was a journalist, and subsequently
discovered that he was an author. In 1899
Bennett notes in his journal: “This year I
have written 335,340 words—224 articles
and stories, and four instalments of a serial
have actually been published; also my book
of plays, Polite Farces. My work included
six or eight short stories not yet published,
also the greater part of a 55,000-word serial.
.... And the whole draft. 80,000 words, of
ray Staffordshire novel (now Anna of the
Five Towns).” And in 1900 Enoch A. Ben-
nett “went to live in France, remaining there
nearly eight years. Most of his books were
written there, at a cottage in Fontainebleau.”
In these few words his biographer dismisses
what is proßably the most interesting portion
of Bennett’s life. One would particularly
like to know more about the French Arnold
Bennett. However, we do get some inter-
esting particulars of “The Five Towns,”
including a useful map. We learn that the
potteries are surrounded by almost idyllic
country; yet “nowhere in all Bennett’s
novels, nowhere in anything he records of
any of his characters’ minds, is the faintest
trace of any appreciation or any perception
of scenery or ‘natural’ beauty. So Lichfield
and Trent, moor and meadow, may vanish
from this survey like the fabric of fairyland;
there shall be no green shades nor shining
orchard peace nor Sunday calm in these pages
—nothing but men and women and houses,
and the fires that burn in all three.”
“The people in the Five Towns novels be-
long to hardly a dozen families” —of the
middle class, plain and immitigable. These
people always think themselves right; they
seldom allow for any other point of view than
their own. They have never had the need
for gentleness or amenity. And Enoch A.
Bennett is a Five Townsman —keen, inter-
ested, exceedingly shrewd, very practical and
efficient, limited in certain directions, rather
coarse-fibred in others. He sought his mar-
ket, made his grievous mistakes, wrote down
to his public, and produced one work of
genius, The Old Wives’ Tale. “He had
long regarded Maupassant’s TJne Vie as a
supreme novel, but he meant to go beyond
Une Vie , or at any rate to go as far.” And
it is 7 this novel, so conceived, that is Ben-
nett’s sole claim to recognition.
“It is the story of many lives; youth,
marriage, the inexorable swift passage of
the devouring years, adhesion to a place,
death. Arnold Bennett tells it in such a
manner that he never comments upon the
two old wives; he never criticises the society
in which they live; he never dwells upon
any figure or thing in such a way that it
stands out disproportionately from its
environment; his own opinions, his sequence
of ideas, his arrangement of the successive
incidents, are wholly concealed.. The book
is just a chronicle, told with such profound
art, such equableness and perfection of con-
struction, that it might be written by some
spirit in another world a thousand years
hence.”
Stressing his comment that “The Card,”
presented as the pride and fine flower of
“Five Towns” life, is apparently admired
by his creator, Bennett’s biographer compiles
a list of Bennett’s principal “heroes,” from
which we see that the typical Bennett
“hero” is either dishonest, adulterous, un-
couth, shifty, specious, pushing- or untruth-
ful- The Five Towns young man is
cheaply and inadequately educated.... His
ehiei aim in life is to get money ; to dress
and behave smartly; to marry, but not
always to be pedantically monogamous. He
has few standards of conduct; he is sharp,
and his sharpness is of the kind which breaks
the spirit, not the letter, of the law.” The
old men of Bennett’s are “a nightmare.”
And Bennett, except in The Old Wives’
Tale, identifies himself with the society of
this remarkable district, takes its aggressive,
defiant point of view.
Of Bennett’s plays little is said, because
there is little to. be said. He is not a
dramatist. Nor is he a novelist, except in
his one important book. For the rest Enoch
A. Bennett has discovered and accurately
pictured a particularly unlovely society, iso-
lated in dismal surroundings, and proudly
claims that he belongs to that society.
The Round Table
“The end of the war will not come unti
the German armies are so reduced in num
bers by constant fighting that there are n
longer enough unwounded adult male Gei
mans to man the lines which protect thei
territory from invasion The Allies hav
got to face losses not far short of those o
the Germans if they mean to win, and stil
have a. superiority at the end. But the policy
of attrition in war costs not very far short o'
man for man. And if, as is likely, we have
to kill or disable another 2,000,000 Germans
before the road to Germany itself is clear, i
means that not very far short of that number
of English, French and Russians must be
killed or disabled, too. That is the conclu
sion. It is ghastly, but it is at least decisive
It shows us the measure of the effort whicl
is still before us. We have to face it, anc
the sooner we face it the quicker it will be
done, and the smaller will be the cost.” In
these words The Round Table for .Tune
(2s. 6d.) succinctly sums up the situation.
We count on attrition winning the war. So
do the Germans. They count on exhausting
France before Britain is ready to step in
and fill her place.
Every article in this valuable quarterly
this issue deals with the war. The ablest
article shows how wars are paid for and
financed. Here the necessity of economy on
the part of the community is sternly empha-
sised.. The Empire must pay for the war;
and in. the end there is only one way by
which it can pay its enormous debts ; every
individual must practise the most rigid
economy, the same stern economy that is now
being practised by the German people.
“Every pound’s worth of food wasted means
a pound’s more import, a pound more in the
bill against this country (England), and pro-
bably a pound more of our vital gold reserve
exported. We_ ought to import only
absolute necessities, either munitions of
war, or raw material for our exports* or
food and other sui)plies which we can by no
means dispense with.” The lesson must be
applied in this continent. Our Government
must encourage and popularise the invest-
ment of savings. . Every man and every
woman in Australasia must practise the most
rigid economy in order that we may be able
to pay our debts abroad and subscribe suc-
cessfully to the enormous war loans that
must be raised locally.
In another excellent article, “The Founda-
tions of Peace,” the writer points dramati-
cally to an inevitable outcome of the war —
the representation of the Dominions in the
councils of the Empire. “The Dominions
have been committed to war by the act of
the British Government, and they have given
the. lives of their sons and the resources of
their citizens for the common cause with not
less alacrity than the British people. But
they will never do it again. It is incredible
that 15,000.000 of the most civilised of men
will continue to forego the Very essence of
self-government—the control of the policy
which makes for peace or war-—when they
realise how much the present war is due to
the exigencies of party strife in England and
the inadequacy of the machinery of govern-
ment of the Empire. . . .They will discover
that the autonomy which they possess is a
sham so long as the essential attribute of
sovereignty-control of the issues of peace and
war is concentrated at Westminster. . . .It
is obvious that dominion pressure will make
in the direction of creating a separate body,
free from the distractions of the English
party system, to deal with foreign and'im-
pel'ini affairs.”

The 3 H.P., 2 speed, Free Engine ROYAL ENFIELD is positively the BEST
MOTOR CYCLE that money will buy. It embraces features which are not
to be found in other makes.
LUBRICATION. —There are no hit or miss methods in the Royal Enfield
system —it is automatic. When the engine is running there is a continuous
circulation of oil, thoroughly lubricating each cylinder.
THE POWER UNIT. —There is no more reliable power unit than the 3 H.P.
standard engine, which has a bore and stroke of 60 mm. and 75 mm., respec-
tively, giving a capacity of 425 C.C. On this capacity enormous power is

Diogenes
believed
the worst
Cynical, sceptical, selfish, dis-
courteous ; even at this distance
it is no job to diagnose Diogenes.
He said he was looking for an
honest man, but he was not even
honest with his own liver. It
wanted to do its work. It wanted
so much to clear the poisons of
gloom and bitterness out of
his blood and his thoughts. It
yearned to make him see the
good side of the world and of
humanity. But did Diogenes
help it ?
No. He was one of those
people who treat their liver
as an enemy, and refuse to
believe its intentions are good.
Probably he punished and in-
jured it with violent pills or
morning draughts. Anyone can
be a Diogenes by doing that, and
accumulating a stock-in-trade of
gloomy, bitter little toxins in his
blood. But who wants to be a
Diogenes ? Far wiser to live in
friendly partnership with one’s
liver and give it, now and then, the
gentle, natural, welcome help of

MISS AGNES MURPHY
THE ORGANISING SECRETARY OF THE
Quinlan Opera Coy.
AND THE
Biographer of Madame Melba,
WRITES HER OPINION OF
CLEMENTS
TONIC
DEAR SIRS, —
*‘l have sincere pleasure in informing you that I have found Clements
Tonic an excellent and most agreeable restorative after exhaustion due to
overwork, and that as a brain and body builder I can highly commend it.”
I am, gentlemen, faithfully yours,
(Signed) AGNES MURPHY.
Members of any of the large theatrical companies, whose duties are of a
strenuous character, whose long and exacting roles compel heavy and con-
tinuous taxation of the brain and nerves, should strengthen their systems
and fortify their health by the use of Clements Tonic. Testimonies to this
great nerve medicine have been received from many theatrical favorites,
well known in England and Australia, and each of these speaks in highesi
praise of this excellent tonic nerve medicine. Theatrical artists new to the
climate will find this remedy invaluable. For the relief of Insomnia, or
loss of sleep, Weak Nerves, Indigestion, Poor Appetite, Depression of Spirits,
Anaemia or General Weakness, it has no equal. Send for it and health at
the same time.
In volcanic times like these, when the whole world is at war, and the
nerves of everyone are on edge, this is the medicine that keeps the nerves
sound and the body well. As the Rev. Hosking, Fitzroy, says: “It is worth
its weight in gold.” It is just the very medicine for that tired brain and
those jaded nerves.

KRUSCHEN AT THE FRONT
Since the outbreak of the War, enormous
quantities'of Kruschen Salts have been ordered
by, and delivered to the British Authorities, for
the use of the British Forces overseas and in
the Base Hospitals at Home. Kruschen Salts
are prescribed by Medical Men the world over.
THE WORD KRUSCHEN

Cie folded down and lavendered with pride
V\ ithin her closet’s sanctuary. A scorn,
Not quite so haughty as her “heart’s intent,
Curls at her lips but envies in her eyes,
To hear the vulgar crowd’s loud merriment,
Flaunting it through her quiet ways. She
sighs
That sparks and hoydens be so unrestrained,
Yet would herself be hoyden did she dare;
And, with a shudder that is only feigned.

Here Orpheus, man not god, first made that
singing
That lingered ages on the Grecian ear;
Here Xerxes watched his Asian legions
bringing
Across the boat-bridge gleaming spear on
spear;
Here Hero sighed, and here Leander, dying,
Breathed low her name in darkness ere lie
sank;
Hither the young god ivy-crowned came flying
Bearing the sun-kissed bowl the ancients
drank.
Up these blue waters sailed the strong
Crusader,
Hie cross-emblazoned banner at his peak;
And here the tall Venetian played the raider.
Snatching the last spoils from the fading
Greek.
Blood has been shed upon these hills like
water,
A thousand battle-cries these rocks have
known,
And age on age grey Fate above the
slaughter
Has set the crown of empire on her own.
And now again these skies are loud with
thunder,
Death sweeps triumphant over lands" and
seas,
And the large world-eyes open in their
wonder
At the new record of the Chersonese.
The fame of ancient deeds through song and
story
Throws a long light like the departing sun,
And a new morn, red with a stormy glory,
Blazons the fame Australia’s men have won.

The Rider of the Plains.
He canters lightly o’er the grass
That, rippling like the tide,
Bends down before him as he goes
Across the acres wide;
He journeys with a merry heart
All unafraid and free,
And softly to himself he sings
A lilting melody.
Above his head the changing clouds
Sail on to mark his way ;
Beside him, round the ruffled pools,
The whispering rushes sway,
And every plumy head unships
A fleet of tufted seeds,
And all the filmy robbers rise
To follow where he leads.
He loves the creatures of the wild,
And, in his tenderness,
On fur and feather stoops to lay
A vagrant, brief caress ;
Soft, through the golden afternoons,
His gentle fingers bear
Tiie slender threads that spiders weave
To bridge the gulfs of air.
He stirs the plover’s plumage grey,
He tilts the hawk’s wide wings.
The brown larks, circling to the skv,
Catch up tiie song he sings,
And, thrilling with his careless joy,
Throb music as they soar
To scale the sapphire arch that spans
The yellow earthen floor.
Who rides alone may chance to see
His shadowy stallion pass
As noiseless as a drift of mist
Across the seeding grass ;
Hay catch the echo of his tune.
And. shaking, loose the reins.
Hay follow down a gleaming track
The rider of the plains.

THE CHINAMAN OF EUROPE.
FiQurxs collected in the United States by
Senator Lodge for the purpose of analys-
ing the values of immigrants on a racial
basis show that of a total of 14,243 notable
Americans, 12,519 were British, 1065
Latin, and only 659 Teuton. The measure
of notability was fitness for inclusion in
“Appleton’s Encyclopedia of American
Biography.” On the other hand the United
States Census Report on Prisoners for 1904
shows that “in respect to major offences the
Germans stand first.” In this matter the
Bi'iton stands last, and his principal
“offence” is drunkenness. The German’s
specialty, appropriately enough, is “crimes
against property.” The explanation may
be that the system of repression in which
he has been bred has unfitted him for lib-
erty. Also the test of war has shown in
the United States that he is of compara-
tively little use to any but his own people,
and that, especially if he gathers in com-
munities, it is hard for him to merge him-
self in any other race. His atavism is
intentional. The Chinaman reverts invol-
untarily to ancestor-worship, but the Teuton
reverts deliberately to Germanism. Wher-
ever he goes lie finds his Deutsche Schul-
verein. This society has confidential agents
in all countries. It has as motto, “To serve
Germanism is to serve mankind.” Its
daily instruction to the German is as fol-
lows: —•
Take what nationality you choose, conform and
adapt yourselves to the laws, customs, manners of
the place where you may be; learn the language,
become citizens, voters, and vote; be steady. Push
the sale of German goods and the liking for them.
Develop in any, way you can your commercial and
material strength. But remember to do all this
because you are, and always will be, Germans,
People who'“always will be Germans” are
of no use to Australia, which only wants
Australians. It can get them from Britain,
and it must concentrate on getting hold of
every Britisher it can lay its hands on.
* * * *
The central fact of the German situation
is that its system of the past two genera-
tions has evolved a type which is hopelessly
antipathetic to the Briton. This type has
been deliberately grown, to serve the specific
purpose to which it is now being put, with
as much precision as scientific gardeners
show in growing queer plants. Its keynote
is unquestioning submission of the indivi-
dual will to the authority of the State. It
has been noted that conscientious resistance,
active resistance, passive resistance, open
resistance and resistance by evasion, by
subterfuge, or by the skilful abuse of the
law are practically unknown in Germany.
This is because the German from his cradle
upwards is supervised by the State at every
stage. The plan of the State is to eliminate
his personality, and to shape him to the
precise groove along which it intends to run
him. Therefore his “elementary education”
is devoted primarily to “the formation of
character.” This character has been
described as that of “a patient and obedient
link in a chain.” A little later the career
for which he seems most suited is selected
and he is sent to the appropriate gymnasia.
He emerges at the age of IS from his pre-
scribed course, and his career is arranged
for him. As his personality has been re-
moved he is contented —in the sense that a
gelding hackney is contented. This content
makes him love, his State as the comfortable
source of his well-being. If he can be said
to have any political aim it is to get closer
to his protector, German Socialism does
not implicate a breaking from the Govern-
ment or an attack upon the Government.
It is an orderly expression of the German’s
placid : craving for still more Government,
still more local officials to guide him, still
more, monitors to. enlighten him,-.still more
rescripts to enjoin on him wbat it is that
he must and must not do. His officials do
not hold their authority because they have
won it from an adversary. They hold it
because they have been trained to that job.
His. judges are not men who have wrested
distinction from the hurly-burly of the Bar.
They have never been at the Bar and know
nothing of its methods. They are turned
out to order from schools for producing
judges.
Grateful acquiescence in authority is
the essence of the German. Whether an
official orders him to solder his kitchen
saucepans, or his officer spits in his face,
his submission is dumb and unquestioning.
He. is Germanised. To use the phrase
which is current in his country, he has been
“touched with the healing balm of Ger-
manism” and it is the grotesque but hideous
peril of civilisation that he sincerely be-
lieves that “to serve Germanism is to serve
mankind.” It is from this that his belief
springs that his country is the divinely-
appointed heir of the usurper Great Brit-
ain, and that Australia, which is vast in
wealth and territory, yet sparsely peopled,
is his in spiritual duty to acquire. This
time the creed has apparently failed, but
it has behind it the spirit of the martyr, and
unless it is extirpated it will try again. The
attempt will be made either by another war,
or by peaceful penetration, or by that crafty
combination of the two which has ruined
the United States. Australia must be vigil-
antly prepared to resist it in both forms.
To do so it must arm and it must maintain
a racial purity. It must also hurry. Ger-
manism is an enemy which does not wait
for the grass to grow. In 1904 Britain had
known a hundred years of peace, it was
believed to be unchallengeable, it led' the
world in commerce, in art and literature, in
wealth and industry. Its 202,000 tons of
warships in the Mediterranean handsomely
sufficed to rule the seas. In the North Sea
it required no ships at all. In 1913 it had
half a million tons of battle-craft in the
North Sea, its commercial supremacy was
vanishing and its sea-power was openly
threatened. In 1914 it was fighting for its
life. AH ih ten years. If the German fails
to seize Australia in war he will attempt to
absorb it in peace, and if Australia gives
him eyen half, a chance he will be as quick
off the mark in the one case as he was in
the Other.
* * » * 1
There is one way of clinching the matter,
and that is to make Australia untakeablel
As' the Commonwealth stands it is a menace
to the Empire, just in so far as it is a source
of, temptation to the international live-by-
your-wits. The German has come into the
Empire business too late in the day. He
is a poor man living in an overcrowded
home. If he loses this particular war —
and he now knows at least that is not
going to win it—he will be working three
shifts a night for 20 years to pay the bill.
It is not because of this that he is going to
hesitate. He is as indomitable as the
Britisher. His calculations may be based
upon philosophies of which the normal
Caucasian mind has no conception. They
almost certainly are. But if he could be
made to realise that the acquisition of Aus-
tralia is utterly hopeless—not possibly hope-
ful or remotely possible, but utterly hope-
less —then and then only would he keep
quiet. It can be done. Australia has a
revenue which is constantly expanding. It
is equal to that of Japan, is more than two-
thirds that of Italy, is half as much again
as that of Spain, and is more by many mil-
lions than the revenues of Denmark, Hol-
land, Norway and Sweden combined. If it
had a fleet equal to that of Japan or of
Italy it would not need to worry about
Germany. But until the German is con-
vinced that Australia is beyond him he will
not cense to struggle. The absurd Austra-
lian politician who sees in a vigorous and
adolescent Australia a presage of Imperial
disruption is like the fussy old woman who
is terrified because her growing son begins
to get a move on. Britain itself has no
such tremors.
* * * *
As to peaceful penetration, the modern
German is proved out of place in the Aryan
family. He is as much so as the China-
man. The Chinaman is a pacifist among
savages, and the German is a savage among
pacifists. Europe, after centuries of
struggle, shook itself clear of feudalism. Its
impetus bore Germany along with it. Ger-
manism’s doctrine of unreasoning obedience
is a recrudescence. It is a reversion to a
type which is no longer regarded as civi-
lised. It is true that the German is sober,
thrifty, industrious, amiable, patient, per-
severing, ingratiating. So is the China-
man. Admit that he claims that the out-
side world cannot understand his civilisa-
tion and that it is therefore a barbarian.
So does the Chipaman. All students of
China are agreed as to the incomprehensi-
bility of the Chinese character, and none of
them profess to even guess whether the
ineradicable Chinese patriotism is really
patriotism at all, or merely detestation of
the foreigner. , Whatever the explanation,
the Chinaman ,of Europe possesses this
quality in the Same measure as the China-
man of Asia, whom we have long since
ceased to regard as a desirable immigrant.
GINGER’S COBBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“’E wears perjarmer soots an’ cleans ’is
That’s wot I reads. It fairly knocked me
fiat- , „
“Me soldier cobber, be the name o Keith.
Well, if that ain’t the limit, strike me fat!
The sort that Ginger Mick would think be-
neath
’ls notice once. Perjarmers! Cleans is
teeth!!
Ole Ginger Mick ’as sent a billy-doo
Erum somew’ere on the earth where fight-
in’s thick.
The Censor wus a sport to let it through,
Considerin’ the choice remarks o’ Mick.
It wus that ’ot, I’m wonderin’ since it came
It didn’t set the bloomin’ mail aflame.
I’d love to let you ’ave it word fer word ;
But, strickly, it’s a bit above the odds;
An’ there’s remarks that’s ’ardly ever ’eard
Amongst the company to which we nods.
It seems they use the style in Ginger’s
trench
That’s written out an’ ’anded to the Bench.
It’s this noo pal uv ’is that tickles me;
’E’s got a mumma, an’ ’is name is Keith.
A Ivnut upon the Block ’e used to be,
’Ome ’ere; the sort that flashes Chiner
teeth,
An’ wears ’ot socks, an’ torks a lot o’ guff;
But Ginger says they’re cobbers till they
snuff.
It come about like this: Mick met ’im first
Aboard the troopship in the sergeants’
mess.
’E ’ad nice manners ah’ ’e never cursed;
Which set Mick’s teeth on edge, as you
kin guess.
Likewise, ’e ’ad two silver brushes, which
’ls mumma give ’im, ’cos ’e fancied sich.
Mick pinched ’em. Not, as you will under-
stand,
Becos uv any base desire fer loot,
But jist becos, in that rough soljer band,
Them silver-backed arrangements didn’t
soot,
An’ etiket must be observed always.
(They fetched ten drinks in Cairo, Ginger
says.)
That satisfied Mick’s honor fer a bit;
But still ’e picks at Keith fer exercise ;
An’ all the other blokes hear ’as a fit
To see Mick squirm at Keith’s perlite re-
plies.
Till one day Keith retorts: “You flamin’
cow!”
Then Mick permotes ’im, an’ they ’as a row.
I ses “permotes ’im,” fer, you’ll understand,
Ole Ginger ’as ’is pride o’ class orl right;
’E’s not the bloke to go an’ soil ’is ’and
Be stoushin’ any coot that wants tp fight.
’lm that ’as ’ad ’is chances more’n once
Up at the Stajum ain’t no bloomin’ dunce.
Yeh’ll ’ave to guess wot sprter fight took
place.
Keith learnt ’is boxin’ at a “culcher”
school.
The first three rounds, to save ’im frum dis-
grace,
Mick kids ’im on an’ plays the gentle fool.
An’ then he outs ’im with a little tap,
An’ tells ’im, after, ’e’s a plucky chap.
They likes each other better after that,
Fer Ginger always ’ad a reel soft spot
Fer blokes ’oo ’ad some man beneath their
’at,
An’ never whined about the jolts they got.
Still, pride o’ class kent ’em frum gettin’
thick —
It’s ’ard to get right next to Ginger Mick.
Then comes Gallipoli, an’ wot Mick calls
“An orl-in push fight multip’ied be ten”';'
An’ one be one the ossifers they falls,
Until there’s no one left to lead the
For arf a mo’ they ’esitates stock still;
Fer ’oo’s to lead ’em up the flamin’ ’ill?
’Oo is to lead ’em if it ain’t the bloke
’Oo’s ’eaded pushes down in Spadgers
Lane
Since ’e first learnt to Walk %h’ swear an’
smoke,
An’ mixed it willin’ both fer fun an’ gain—
That narsty, ugly, vi’lent man ’oo’s got
’Old on the minds of men when blood runs
ot?
Mick led ’em ; an’ behind ’im up the rise,
’Owlin’ an’ cursin’, comes that mumma’s
jov.
’ls cobber Keith, with that look in ’is eyes
To give the ’eart of any leader joy.
An’ langwidge ! If ’is mar at ’ome ’ad ’eard
She would ’a’ threw a fit at ev’ry word.
Mick dunno much about wot ’appened then, ’
Except ’e felt ’is Dream o’ Stoush come’
true;
Fer ’im an Keith they fought like fifty men,
An’ felt like gawds with ev’ry breaf they
drew.
Then Ginger gits it solid in the neck,
An’ flops, an’ counts on passin’ in ’is check.
When ’e come to, the light was gettin’ dim,
The ground was cold an’ sodden under-
neath ;
Someone is lyin’ right ’longside of ’im ;
Groanin’ wif pain, ’e turns, an’ sees it’s
Keith —
Keith, wif ’is rifle cocked, an’ starin’ ’ard
Ahead. An’ now ’e says: “’Ow is it, pard ?”
Mick gently lifts ’is ’ead an’ looks eround.
There ain’t another flamin’ soul in sight;
They’re covered be a bit o’ risin’ . ground,
An’ rifle-fire is crackling to the right.
“Down !” sez the mumma’s joy. “Don’t show
yer ’ead
Unless yeh want it lodded full o’ lead.”
Then, bit by bit, Mick gits the strength uv
it:
They was so occupied wif privit scraps
They never noticed ’ow they come to git
Right out ahead of orl the other chaps.
They’ve binxmt orf, wif jist one little chance
Of gettin’ back. Mick seen it at a glance.
“ ’Ere, kid,” ’e ses, “you sneak hround' that
’ill.
I’m down an’ out; an’ you kin tell the
boys.”
Keith don’t reply to ’im but jist lies still,
An’ motions Ginger not to make a noise.
“ ’Ere you!” ses Mick, “I ain’t the man to
funk.
I won’t feel ’ome-sick fer yell. Do a bunk!”
Keith.bites ’is lips; ’e never turns ’is ’ead.
“Wot in the ’ell!” ses Mick, “’ere, wot’s
yer game?”
“I’m an Australian,” that wus all ’e said,
An’ pride took old o’ Mick to ’ear that
name — ', v
A noo, glad pride that ain’t the pride o’
class.
An’ Mick’s contempt it took the count at
lars!
All night th'ey stayed there, Mick near mad
wif pain,
An’ Keith jist lettin’ up ’is watchful eye
To ease Mick’s wounds an’ bind ’em up
again,
An’ give ’im water, w’ile ’imself went dry.
Brothers they wuz, ’oo found their brother-
hood
That night oh Sari Bair, an’ found it good
Brothers they wuz. I’m wond’rin ? , as I read
This scrawl uv Mick’s, an’ git its me'anin’
plain,
If you, ’oo never give these things no ’eed,
Ain’t got some brothers down in Spadgers
Lane —
Brothers you never ’ad the chance to meet,
Becos they got no time fer Collins Street.
“I’m an Australian!” Well, it takes the
bun!
It’s got that soft spot in the ’eart o’ Mick.
But don’t make no mistake; ’e don’t gush
none,
Or come them “brother’ood” remarks too
thick.
’E only writes: “This Keith’s a decent.coot,
Cohher o’ mine, an’ white from cap to hoot.”
“’E wears perjarmers an’ e’ cleans ’is teeth,”
The sorter bloke that Ginger once des-
pised !
But once a man shows metal underneath,
Cobbers is found, an’ brothers reckernised.
Fer, when a bloke’s soul-clobber’s shed in
war,
’E looks, the sorter man Gawd meant ’im
for.
VICTOKIA.
THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE.
WHEN LIBERALS HOLD THE
MIRROR UP TO PARTY.
The Liberals have been throwing a search-
light on themselves, and in course of the
operation have illuminated the manner in
which they propose to take the public down
in Federal and State affairs. Cook, Mil-
len, McMillan and even smaller fry have
again explained at great length that
Liberalism is horrified at the idea of
the nation being “split asunder by
controversial politics.” This was no
time for party, they patriotically wept;
it was the moment for amity, for consolida-
tion, for fusion, not only among the politi-
cians but among the electors. To a very
great extent it is all true enough. This
certainly is no time for party. ; The pesti-
lential blight is no good at any time. It
was an abomination yesterday; it will be a
public nuisance to-morrow. But the Liberal
spokesmen refuse to admit that. On the
confessions of Cook they are energetically
banging the anti-party drum, not with the
object of stifling party, but for the purpose
of getting anti-Sosh recruits. Men who
would come forward and say to Australia:
“This'party' business is an outrage on your
democracy— det us sweep the evil thing away
and make ’government by the people real,”
would have 'a . proposal demanding the ap-
plause of the nation. But a crowd which
leaps round the fire pouring petrol on the
flames in order to suppress them only s\c-
cceds in proclaiming itself a dangerous
lunatic. It is not party that these people
are objecting to. What they want is a
more numerous anti-Sosh party, or as an
alternative' an Opposition so terrorised as to
shy to the people of Australia: “Because of
uproar and shirk and hate among members
of the Legislature which you pay, we have
decided not to do anything there could be
a difference of opinion about.”, ’
' W, * , * ' * *
That the Liberals should’ be up to all these
petty tactics is not so surprising as that
they, should be proclaiming in public places
the full measure of their trickery. Hitherto
they have, as a rule, carried on their mining
and sapping operations in obscurity. Where
they were burrowing and what they were
rummaging after wyere obvious, enough at all
times, of course, yet' the operators" were not
actually seen at work. But: at a recent
Sydney conference they came right out and
without shame set their traps along the broad
highway. There was, .first of all, a parade
of unwavering deteriniiiation not ‘ by word
or deed to “disturb the public”; a further
chorus .condemning manifestations of party
in Parliament or out of if.; and an emphatic
.pronouncement in favor of political peace.
Then the assembled patriots sat: down to
devise schemes for keeping themselves afloat,
and for the, inure effective blowing of the
party bellows in the constituencies. The
net result of it all was that they decided on
a plan for selecting candidates and organising
in the electorates—for tightening the grip of
their- party machine on the constituencies,
and for keeping agitators busy prowling
about on behalf of anti-Sosh, inciden-
tally blowing poisonous gas on Labor.
How can these windy humbugs expect
the community to believe they are
genuinely anxious to keep the peace
when, besides behaving with provocative vio-
lence in the Legislature, they thus: get busy
on plans for dividing the public more sharply
than ever? How can a claim for truce in
Parliament be reconciled with the promotion
of political warfare among the citizens?
Liberals may be able to offer some kind of
rigmarole in answer, but though it satisfies
them the Australian people will not require
a shipment of foreign-made eafi-trumpets to
detect its hollowness. Nor will they fail to
observe a resemblance between the methods
of these Liberal wirepullers and those Ger-
man specialists who lurk round the battle-
field with a Red : Cross on one -sleev& - arid a
bayonet up the other.
* * * 4
All over Australia the official Liberals, in
spite of their gibes about the shackles of


Labor, are the strongest friends of the party
system: And they always will be, for the
soundest (to them) of all reasons—mistrust
of democratic government. Of this govern-
ment Australia now has the shadow.
The Liberals resisted even that to the
last ditch; they will fight against
materialisation of the substance with
the same weapons, the same fury and
lack of scruples. It is not because they
apprehend any ill-results from the mere tak-
ing of the Referenda that they now call
“Halt!” but because they dread enlargement
of the national powers and popular autho-
rity. Therefore they perhaps see no wrong
in a sinister campaign aimed at gaining
strength for resistance to what they call
socialism by a bogus appeal to what they
call patriotism. To them it is all in the
game. They can even ask for a suspension
of public judgment on points of vital national
interest, while they employ themselves pois-
oning the ground against opponents. They
can see nothing unrighteous in using any
pretext to mobilise an army against the
monster of Sosh, yet can discern a mal-
ignant act of treachery against the Empire
if the other side marshals its forces for a
forward movement. The Bulletin has a
profound disrespect for the party system,
and therefore rejoices that Liberalism should
be thus assisting Australia to notice how
thoroughly depraved in its influence the
party system can be.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
To Test the Sincerity of Various People.
As regards the. Referenda the pernicious old
party flame is kept smoulderin' 1 because
the opposing sides take different views of the
legal situation. Attorney-General Hughes,
speaking for Labor, says that Parliament
has no powers worth mentioning. Joseph
Cook, on. behalf of the Liberals, asserts that
Parliament has powers which are “infinite
and illimitable.” Hughes is certainly right.
Parliament is still, as it was a year ago,
abjectly dependent for authority on the say-
so of the High Court. And Cook might
possibly turn out to be right, upon his
opinion being tested by innumerable law-
suits, inasmuch • as it is conceivable that the
High Court would so far stultify itself as to
say that anything done by Parliament at
the present time was necessary for the
defence of the country. Hughes takes his
stand on the decision in Constitutional cases
of the Court during the past 10 years.
Cook bases, his claim on Section 51 of the
Constitution Act, and on the off-chance that
the High Court would always use the
words contained therein to justify the
actions of the Government. If the elec-
tors agree, with Cook, Parliament is
never going to have more than the
shadowy suspicion of authority which it
at present possesses. If, as The Bulletin
believes is the case, they agree with Hughes,
Parliament will have, to wait till next Decem-
ber ,for the powers which it needs to-day.
Liberal politicians and the Liberal press
have been asking why, if the Fishes’ Gov-
ernment needs : additional powers for war
purposes, it doesn’t go after them at once.
This question has not been- propounded in a
manner which suggests the helpful spirit.
It has invariably borne more resemblance to
a jeer than to a piece of earnest counsel.
But on the- supposition' that Liberalism
means what it has .been saying, namely that
it is willing that Parliament should have
unlimited power from now to the end of the
war, The Bulletin offers a scheme which
should meet the case. Let Parliament put
through a measure clothing the Government
with 1 powers of the most comprehensive
character. With no opposition from the
Cook party it ought to become law in a
matter of days: Like Britain’s Army Act,
which is renewable every year, it could be
made operative for a fixed period—say for
six months, or a year, or till the declaration
of peace. -As' soon as' passed, let the
Act be “put upon its trial” before
the High' Court. If the latter de-
clared the measure to be - intra vires,
as it possibly might, under the section above-
mentioned, there would be no immediate need
to expend time, energy and money on another
Referenda campaign. If, on the other hand,
the Court decided that the Act, or any of it,
was unconstitutional, the Government could
drive ahead with the Referenda in the cer-
tainty that the proposals would be over-
whelmingly carried: The scheme will not
appeal, of course, to the furious party
wranglers of either' : camp. But it has
powerful advantages from the standpoint of
those who ask only that Australia shall be
well served in the present crisis.

A Case in which No Miracle Has
; Occurred.
The S. M. Herald continues to perpetuate
the foolish yarn about the Australian Parlia-
ment being in a position to take any power
it wants under the present Constitution.
Here are the untruthful words for which the
old paper was responsible one day last week :
Mr. Hughes, with no great respect for his audience,
declares that the powers asked for are necessary for
the defence of Australia. We have never been told
of any power connected, however remotely, with
defence which the Minister has not, or could not, take
under the present Constitution.
The muddled idea of the anti-Referenda
crowd apparently is that because the Empire
happens to be at war on a larger scale than
usual, something magical has happened to
the Constitution whereby it has been changed
from a Federal instrument and become one
suited to the Union form of government.
The insane argument is that, in a’ single
night, so to speak, and without any reference
to the electors, this instrument, which was
expressly created with the object of limiting
the powers of the national Legislature, has
been so metamorphosed that it ckn now
dower Parliament with ah power—prnyer as
great as that of the British Parliament jtself.
Dicey remarks in his “Law of the Constitu-
tion” :
Parliament can legally legislate on any topic
whatever which in the judgment of Parliament: is a
fit subject for legislation. There is no power which,
under the English Constitution, can come in rivalry
with the legislative sovereignty of Parliament.
That is, in effect, the position which the
opponents of the Referenda claim has arisen
in Australia as an outcome of the war.
Instead, the Federal Parliament’s position
is, as it always has been, exactly that of a
Limited Company. The company is an entity
which is called into existence for specific pur-
poses and with limited powers. The Federal
Parliament is an entity which was called
into existence also for specific purposes and
with limited powers. The Company’s powers
are limited by its Memorandum and Articles
of Association; Parliament’s powers are
limited by the Constitution Act. If Parlia-
ment travels beyond those powers its Acts
are invalid. It"is the complete and abject
creature of the Statute. Many years ago
the Australian Parliament, being • then as
ignorant of its lack of power as the S. M.
Herald and Melbourne Age appear to be
now, passed legislation which, had it been
valid, would be of great service to the Com-
monwealth in the present crisis. The Excise
Act (1906) was designed to ensure fair
wages to employees in manufacturing con-
cerns. The Australian Industries Preserva-
tion Act was a measure aimed at oppressive
Trusts. In England they would haye been
quite all right. Here the High Court de-
clared them ultra vires the Constitution. The
old position still obtains. Because the Brit-
ish Parliament is a supreme legislative
authority with unlimited authority to make
and unmake laws; because, in a word, it has
power, it may give power—to Mr. Lloyd-
George or Lord Kitchener or the Cabinet
or any other person or body. Because the
Federal Parliajnent has very little power it.
has not much to give away. Under the deci-
sions in the industrial matters above-men-
tioned —decisions which are in no way
affected'by the war —our Parliament or Gov-
ernment cannot legally interfere in any way
with (say) an intra-State clothing or
canning firm. It cannot control a
Trust, however injurious, so long as
the concern has the sense to confine itself to
one State. It is hampered industrially at
every turn. And this is a war in which in-
dustrialism is one of the most important
weapons. Is the nation willing to emascu-
late its Government because war has not
caused Toryism to become resigned to
change ?

The Sizing Up of Things by Brother
Jonathan.
The chances are. that Uncle Sam knows as
well as anyone else that the war has made
him look as cheap as two cents. Not long
ago he was discussing with another party a
series of delicate questions which might at
any moment have gone off bang and are
even now merely stowed away in the ice-
chest. Also, Sam has over-sea possessions,
and the Panama Canal has been dug out,
and the Monroe Doctrine is on the premises.
Each of these things has a fuse attached to
it, and the danger cannot be wafted away by
wind from the mouth of William Jennings
Bryan. The sinking of the Lusitania and
the blowing up of U.S.A. vessels by a per-
son with whom Sam had no previous quarrel
have therefore been reminders to him, not
so much of the futility of Hague Conven-
tions as of the fact that, if he is not ready
to deal with the assailant who strikes him
at a distance, he may find the enemy who
jumps on him nearer home a mighty un-
pleasant circumstance. The point that,
through his great manufacturing facilities,
Sam is doing the Allies a greater service
than if he were actually a combatant has no
application to the problem of most vital
moment at Washington. The problem there
is, not what it can do for others, but what
could the nation do on its own account and
for itself? Recent happenings have shown
to the world that there are shockingly weak
points in the Republic’s armor; and though
those who may be watching are unlikely to
write and tell Sam all that they see, the old
man is not improbably taking an inventory
himself. The scrap of paper and the treaty
and the moral obligation and the better
understanding among men, and all that sort
of thing, are very admirable in their way ;
but they would all fail to bring a bid of
two dollars the lot if put up for sale in San
Francisco. Later on, when Sam has an army
and that fine navy of his grows up, he will
find himself sleeping more comfortably o’
nights than he has been doing since the frost
came.
Everything Comes Right at the Finish.

Parliament, which had been hurriedly summoned
to secret session, met this afternoon. In view of the
urgency of the call, the Prime Minister having confi-
dentially informed members of important news
awaiting them, there was a very fair attendance. Of
the 17 survivors of the House of Reps. 10 were in
their seats. The remainder were prevented from
travelling by the infirmities of age. Of the Senators
eight were able to make the journey. Elaborate
precautions were taken to prevent the public and
newspaper reporters gaining access to the galleries.
Machine guns were mounted at the entrance, and the
lobbies were patrolled by girl scouts.
At the conclusion of the sitting, which occupied
three hours, two of which were passed in prayer, the
Prime Minister handed his bodyguard the following-
typewritten account of the proceedings for public
i nformation:—■
“The meeting passed off without incident. Mem-
bers heartily cheered the Minister for Defence at the
conclusion of his statement, and' complimented the
Minister for Customs on the industrial outlook. Cer-
tain financial provisions were agreed to.”
Later in the evening a further communique stated
that, unless the Referenda were proceeded with some
day, the Ministry would make a fresh pronouncement
on the subject.
As the result of investigation, conducted with
reserve lest anything of value to the enemy might be
repealed, it Was learned that the main business before
the two Assemblies (the sitting was a joint one) had
been of-a most encouraging character. It transpired
that during the previous week the Minister for Defence
had, after 17 years’ correspondence, cabling and per-
sonal interviews, been definitely informed that full
details of the kind of shells required, and how to
make them, were posted to Melbourne nine months
after the war started. By a slight mistake, however,
the letter had been addressed to the Minister for
Marine instead of to the Minister for Defence, and
that gentleman had ever since been writing to the
Admiralty for an explanation of what had been taken,
for incomplete plans of a coffer dam for floating the
cruiser Brisbane. It was now expected that within
a period to which the Minister did not care to com-
mit himself the manufacture of shells would com-
mence. . . \ '
Members of the non-party committee which had
been advising the Government on these matters ex-
pressed their entire approval of what had been'done.
“We have been so immersed in matters of detail,”
one of them observed to-night, sipping some pepton-
ised milk from a. loving cup presented, to him by the
Stone Breakers’ Union, “that it is a relief to have
this off our hands.”
The character of the announcement made by the
Minister for Customs was of a sensational nature.
Though the Minister. explains that he is compelled
to maintain a strict silence’lest anything he might
say should be given a wrong interpretation, it is
said, on the best authority,, that not only has the
forgotten art of making boots been discovered, but
the task of weaving stockings has actually been
approached with success by a former director of the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co., now living at Toorak
(Vic.) in a state of indigence. Indeed, the Minister
is said to have had exhibited to him a complete
pair of stockings.
If this news should prove to be correct, there is
evidently a great future before Australian industry,
and the tinkerers who have been calling for a revi-
sion of the tariff will receive the set-back they are
entitled to.
“0.K.”: Thusfar the disbursement of the
Belgian Fund has been controlled mainly by
English-speaking people. The World’s
Work talks of it as “a marvellous triumph
of American energy, American power of
organisation and American generosity,” and
the spread-eagle claim has a lot of truth in
it. Now, how can William pose as the
benevolent annexer of the country whilst
people speaking the hated English language
are handing out clothes and tucker to the
population he has pauperised? The Ger-
mans, naturally enough, want to take over
that “triumph of American energy and gen-
erosity” ; and the only way in which the
Kaiser can manage it and thereby become
the giver of all good things "in poor little
Belgium is by forcing President Wilson
to declare war against Germany.™ All
Americans would then be promptly requested
to clear out of Belgium and leave the distri*
bution of the Funds to be managed by the
dominant Huns, by arrangement perhaps
with Holland, the neutral power that speaks
a sort of German. This is what the long-
drawn-out controversy with President Wil-
son must lead to unless Wilson flatly
refuses to he bounced into a position of im-
potent enmity.
Sciiomburgk, who controls the gaols of
South Aus., says he has too many guests.
If the Bench considers the case ‘so mild
that a fine will meet it, why not let the
offender pay by instalments, he wants to
know, instead of gaoling him because he
can’t pay £5 down out of a 50-bob salary?
Further, why not let him pay as much as
he can and “take out” the rest? Still,
though these reforms would reduce the guest
list in a _ lump, education or something is
reducing it by degrees. Prison admissions
last year showed a specially large shrinkage
in women; but this may have been due to
the new Convicted Inebriates Act; which
stops the female drunkard from turning up
again after a few days’ liberty. On the
Other hand, the Habitual Criminals Act is
a dubious quantity, according to Adelaide
experience. “Of the 10 habituals who have
been released, seven have left the State and
their whereabouts is unknown; but it is
known that one has found his way into a
prison in Tasmania, one has been declared
an habitual in Victoria, and one has again
been declared an habitual in this State,
after having been at large for only 14 days.”

“Quidam” : With the census of able-bodied
people suitable for fighting we should take
another of all able-bodied people suitable for
work but unemployed, and then consider an
organised scheme for setting them to pro-
ductive employment as soon as possible. At
any time an unemployed person is a dead
loss to the community; at a time like the
present, when production should be at its
highest possible pitch, able-bodied unem-
ployed are an exceptionally serious blight,
and steps should be taken to see that there
aren’t any. Within 200 miles of each of
the three greater cities of Australia there is
land to profitably absorb the labors of mil-
lions of people, judging by the population
other countries support. It is on the
average far better land than that which in
Germany is now saving 75 millions of people ;
and the entire area of Germany is only
about two-thirds of this territory within a
200-mile radius of Sydney, Melbourne and
Adelaide. The German principle of ordain-
ing that every yard of productive ground
shall produce, irrespective of what the
owner may think about it, would be a good
one to introduce at any time; but at
present, when expenditure is going up at an
abnormal rate, and there is such a scarcity
of so many necessary products, it is particu-
larly important that something out of the
normal should be done to avoid unemployed
people in an unemployed land. I write
this from the country on the western slope
of the Blue Mountains (N.S.W.). Some
day, when this comes into its own, and is
utilised to the uttermost, hundreds of thou-
sands of people will be supported here and
live better than a few do now. Wheat, oats,
barley, rye, maize, potatoes, English fruit
of all kinds, vegetables, and any description
of live stock can be produced, while the
climate is ideal for building up a sturdy
race equal to that of any land. Frost and
snow and sunshine and fresh air—the brac-
ing, invigorating air of the mountains —
combine to make the locality pre-eminently
suitable for the rearing of fine men and
women. All that is required to bring about
an influx of new and more energetic blood
is the declaration that at this or any other
juncture we can’t afford to let people hold,
land which they don’t put to the best use,
from the community’s point of view*

There is a type of pious citizen who re-
quires to be silenced in the interests of ,
national safety. Two of him transpired last
week, one in Sydney and the other in a Mel-
bourne paper. The Sydney calamity asked :
“Why has not the Almighty given, us victory
ere this?” He explained that “we have to.
deab with a. jealous God” ; that “we have set.
up our own abilities. against His”; and that
the proper course is to cease work and pray,
after which “the fall o.f Constantinople will
soon follow.” The enemy, in the view of the
Melbourne catastrophe, was compulsory ser-
vice. What, he inquired, was Germany’s
weakness? What is going to destroy her?
For about half a century she has taken hundreds of
thousands —yea, millions—of her youth from home at'
the age Af 16 or 17 years and herded them like
cattle in military pen-folds. , , *
The crank who urges that we should make no
preparations to defend ourselves is no more
than a mild irritant in time of peace. But
when war arrives he becomes a menace, more
especially when his pro-shirk appeals are
backed by the jargon of religion. In the
oply recipe for winning a war the ingredi-
ents are work and sacrifice, at home and
.abroad. And no nation was ever weakened
when war arrived by the fact that it had
prepared for the horror by conscription and
otherwise. The British Empire is in its
present parlous state, and thousands of good
men have been killed and thousands more
are going to follow them, largely because it
has for years allowed fools like this pair to
warp public opinion. There is no profit in
repining at his stage. But, at least during
the currency of the war, people should be
discouraged from justifying those who want
to do nothing for their country.

“Quill” ends the trouble :
These disastrous N. S. Wales trawlers might be set
going again if Ministers took advantage of the large
quantity of volunteer labor there is about. Furious
offers to help make shells have been, thrown out
from warehouses, where they make nothing except
money; frantic proposals to assist in any way have
been projected at the atmosphere from behind a thou-
sand bingies. Well, this attack of chaos in the Fisji
Department is a pretty serious business. Thirty or
forty-thousand pounds of Cohen’s good cash are con-
cealed’in these tubs; beef and mutton -are at- famine
prices? and the ships that could catch cheap fish are
only catching marine growth. .Therefore let some of
these active workers come along and sign on and
get down to something real. Think of the loud
hurrahs that would greet them on returning to port
with baskets of schnapper and john dory! Why, they
have the chance of a lifetime to earn fame and grati-
tude'! Anyone who has been at sea on a trawler
knows that. The wet, sloppy deck ; the cold, dank
trawl coming aboard in, the middle of the night;
the prickly spines that! go up', under your nails
when in the dark you grab a random fish; the spasm
of apprehensive horror when your feet leave 1 the-deck ,
the ’pulley-hauling of ashes 'up from belqvv, and the
frantic stagger with a bucket to leeward as the
vessel surges in the roll--all this is delight-
fully exhilarating, and' so are the wet pants arid
dripping coat, tie large mug of coffee and the
hunk of bread, the overpowering smell of oil and the;
sweet scent of fish clinging fondly to your whiskers.
The idea of these trawlers being laid up and the
public of Sydney not getting cheap fish, merely
because a few wretched firemen and others defy a
labor Ministry with demands for better wages, is
intolerable when patriotic citizens are ready to do
their duty in this crisis!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My lady moon, with a ripplh of gold,
Climbed up by the dark of the orchard
trees ;
The wind of the night with a kiss was bold
As he smacked my lips with the salt of
the seas.
And a laugh rang out from the shadows
a-throng—
Oh, was it a laugh or the night’s own song?
“Oh, where have you been, lady moon,” said
“Since last you looked over the ridge of
the hill?
For I thought as you rose that I heard you
sigh,
And a tear is wet on your lashes still.
Where have yOu been, my lady of night,
For your hair is gold, but your cheek is
white?”
“Oh, I have been where the warm seas kiss
The shore of a summer that faints with
fear,
Where the lpud pain walks and the bullets
hiss,
And death is glad when my light comes
near.
And I shudder still as I pause to think
Of the dark-red dew that the dry weeds
drink.
“Most fearful sights have I seen and known.
I have thrilled to the deeds that the strong
£nen do.
In a single night has my white light shown
More schrn of death than the ages knew ;
And nlore new-made graves have I silvered
o’er
Than I counted in fifty years before.”
“Oh, where you have been, moon,” said
“Was the blood well spent, was the work
well done?
No censor’s pencil in all the sky
Cdn hide your view of the; hard fight won.
Are we driving the foe, shall we hear at
last
That the bars are down and the death-gate
fiast?”
“Oh, where I have been the foe is proud,
And his legions yield but to utmost pain,
Add his arm is strong and his guns are loud,
And he lifts his hand but to grasp again;
And hope has a weary way to tread
Eire the price be paid of the good blood
shed.”
“O lady moon, you have seen and know!
Is it true that the foeman’s heart grows
weak?”
“Nay, I see not the heart of friend or foe,
But I nightly watch when the great guns
speak,
And their flame is a tempest unbroken still
Where the hot steel answers an iron will.
“But this one large word, uncensored and
plain,
Let me speak in my light for all to hear:
The foe is strong in the teeth of pain,
Strong even as you who can mock at fear,
And none the end of his strife shall see
Till, man and gun, you are strong as he.”

The War of Shells and Sovereigns.
Somebody has been accusing the Kaiser of
having declared that the war will be over by
October; someone else has rentftl'ked during
the week that by the end of tile year Ger-
many will be hopelessly bankrupt; a third
set of “well informed” people have explained
that the Hunnish officials at Constantinople
are preparing to bolt for the Fatherland,
and that the Turk is a victim of severe de-
pression. If all these things were true there
would be justification for at least a gentle
game o’ maffick. But it is all merely the
score from the latest potshots at anticipation.
At no point has the military tide commenced
to run very definitely against the enemy ex-
cept in a sort of negative sense. His first
strong position in Gallipoli has not been
carried. On their southern front the
Russians have been thrust still further back;
in Poland the struggle for possession of War-
saw and the railway connection with Russia
has been renewed with fierce intensity. A
decisive victory at this point would be of
immense military value to the German;
failure would heavily discount the advan-
tages gained in Galicia, for there, though the
Russian has been forced to yield, his line has
not been pierced. In Flanders the fight
rages to and fro without very definite tacti-
cal advantage to either side. Whatever
moral damage the enemy is suffering at this
point can at best be merely a matter of
speculation, more or less rash ; and the fore-
casts about the length of time the Dual Alli-
ance can survive the choking effects of finan-
cial and commercial isolation are scarcely
better than guesswork. Into such considera-
tions as these intrudes the vaguely under-
stood factor of national psychology. So
far as Australia is concerned, the certain
points are that our fighting men require re-
inforcement, and that the nation is beginning
to understand that war is an animal with a
horrible appetite for life and cash. The
casualty lists are becoming familiar; within
a very short time the public will be familiar-
ising, itself with an instalment of the bill,
and, incidentally, getting face to face with a
few little problems relating to State and
Commonwealth finance.
Suggestions for forming a “National Gov-
ernment” in Maoriland by allotting port-
folios to _ Oppositionists seem to have
appealed with much force to Bill Massey,
who, on being informed that, in the event of
sufficient inducement being offered, the other
side would not even dream of having party
politics at this stage, immediately offered to
find room in the Ministry for three Ward-
ites. But as the WARD-ites’ anxiety for a
truce was tempered by a demand for four
jobs, there was at last advices nothing
doing, though underground operations were
still going forward. Massey had apparently
a choice between being partly swallowed and
trusting himself to the brown majority of
one; but as Henare was for the moment
standing on the right foot Massey decided
that he was able to pull through. What
demoralisation _ the party system leads to!
The public which elected Parliament has no
voice in these things. On mere bargaining
depends whether Parliament shall serve the
public or be throttled. Nothing more
dangerous than an uncritical Parliament can
very easily be imagined, yet in the name of
national safety a conspiracy, is openly
hatched for bringing this very thing into
existence. Maoriland with its equally-
balanced parties has an unrivalled oppor-
tunity for establishing National Government
on the sure foundation of an Elective Min-
istry. Then the country’s Parliament would
be what it ought to be, and not what so
many sham patriots and party Bumbles
want to keep it.
When Lieut. H. W. Gilchrist went west
at the Dardanelles a good Australian was
lost. The son of a soldier (Major Gilchrist,
of N. S. Wales Public Instruction Depart-
ment), he served in the Boer war, first as a
trooper and afterwards as an officer. On
returning he was appointed to the N.S.W.
mounted police and rose to a good command.
When the World’s War broke out he was
among the first to offer the best that he had.
The delay in making munitions in Aus-
tralia turns out to be owing to the British
War Office, which in the words of Senator
Pearce “is daily pressed for replies which
never come.” Hughes, too, is in the same
position regarding metal contracts, of which
the British Government will not relieve
Broken Hill producers. There is a War
Precautions Act, but Britain somehow will
not put it in force against the alleged
British successors to the German contract-
ors for the purchase of zinc concentrates.
There are* no zinc-smelting works worth
mentioning in Britain—they were mostly
in Haldane’s “spiritual home,” Germany.
So the Australian zinc-concentrate market
is congested, and the Broken Hill cos. can
do nothing because the contracts they have
made with the Germans are still liable to
be enforced at the conclusion of the war.

the inaction from £2O to £lOO a ton.

Poor Marshall Hall’s reappointment to
the Ormond Professorship of Music at Mel-
bourne University was not much good to
him. A belated operation for appendicitis
—or, rather, the blood-poisoning which the
operation couldn’t avert —carried him off
last Sunday. There was much to be said
for Marshall Hall as a musical enthusiast —
honest, boyish and audacious —and a good
deal to be said against him as a pronounced
German schoolist and a teacher of pedantry.
He started off with a larger reputation than
he deserved, especially in regard to orches-
tral concert work. A crowd of clever orches-
trians, imported at Exhibition time, had
stayed in Melbourne, and they 'had a
better practical ■ knowledge of many
symphonies and things than the energetic
Professor who undertook to conduct them.
Thus Hall didn’t create the orchestra —it
created, him. On the strength of his master-
ful position he talked a lot of nonsense that
was not .healthy for his young Conserva-
torium disciples. Eor years, too, he spat
derision at all music that hadn’t been made
in Germany. He spoke of Melba in the first
place as a warbler of stuff not worth listening
to ; and he did his best to persuade the self-
elected “elect” that Dolores was devoting
her art to the popularisation of “rubbish.”
He and his followers were shocking musical
snobs in those days. Subsequently he re-
canted in a measure, but he was an intensely
Germanised Professor to the finish, and many
a man of smaller talents might have been
more of an ornament to the University.

At the Sydney Repertory Theatre on Satur-
day Louise Mack, who was once “Gouli-
Gouli” . of The Bulletin’s “Woman's
Letter,” told a large audience about the
trouble in Belgium in the first of a series of
lectures, entitled “Mid Shot, Shell and Shrap-
nel in Belgium.” Louise Mack is not a lec-
turer; her talk is just a chat. Quietly,
almost confidentially, she told her audience,
in a voice that involved a strain upon her
listeners in the back seats, how war appeared
to her romantic temperament, and while she
talked she slowly tore to pieces a little bunch
of artificial flowers. The support accorded
to her by her manager was, on the opening

night, rather feeble. The lantern pictures
of national flags were crudely painted in
unfamiliar colors ; the map illustrating Miss
Mack’s travels was, she herself admitted,
incomplete; and the motion pictures that
accompanied rhe conversation were in sub-
ject hardly new.
It was not to be expected that a woman-
correspondent would be admitted to the fir-
ing-line ; and in the instalment of her adven-
tures narrated on the opening night there
was no first-hand account of actual fighting.
Louise Mack managed to persuade a London
editor to send her to Belgium. She arrived
at Ostend, saw wounded Belgians and Ger-
man prisoners arrive, learnt that the Ger-
mans were attacking Ostend, and returned
the next day to England. But immediately
afterwards she was again on her way, this
time to Antwerp. Much of her chat dealt
with the extreme difficulties of travelling
through a country infested by Germans. She
described the advent of the first Zeppelin;
told how the cai’riage in which she was trav-
elling ran right into the Bavarian army in its
successful effort to get into Brussels, then in
the hands of the Huns ; and enlivened all her
descriptions with a quiet humor. It was all
interesting rather than thrilling. It was the
sort of story that a brave and adventurous
woman would tell to her friends on her re-
turn, convincing and true —hardly informa-
tive, rather the impressions that war had
made on a romantic and feminine mind;
psychologically of the greatest interest; an
intensely personal view of warfare. But it
should be mentioned that by compressing her
earlier experiences Louise Mack was enabled,
in her subsequent lectures, to include the
more exciting incidents of the siege of
Antwerp. The effect the Germans made
on her was described with the skill
of a practised writer and the intui-
tion of a woman. To her the Ger-
man was “brute to the nth degree”;
everything about him, physically, intellectu-
ally and morally was brutal; and because
he sincerely believes Wrong is Right he is
the most dangerous thing in the world.
Louise Mack has no lecturer’s tricks; she
makes her points almost casually; you feel
that what she says is true; and she gives
her impressions With a nractised economy of
words. In short, Louise Mack, in this series
of lectures, is writing one of her old
“Woman’s Letters” from the Front.

the sort of sweet child whose smiling arrival
would explode a jumble fair in aid of the
poor Belgians, send the dowagers flying like
fowls to cover, and reduce the curate to a
state of ecstatic nervousness. Her adven-
tures in the play are butterfly flights along
the edge. Tom Shelford and Henry J. Ford,
the two hilarious husbands of the piece, rush
through their comedy in an exhilarating
way; Frank Bradley dodders very naturally
as the aged crank Galipaux; and Edward
Landor supplies a good humorous study of
the degraded ex-waiter Chausette. Harry
Sweeney flutters through the part of the
amorous bouquet-carrier Tracassin; and
Alice Hamilton and Elwyn Harvey, as the
two young wives, are both good to look at
and pleasant to listen to. On Saturday night
“Who’s the Lady?” is to be given a run,

usual week-end matinee.

“The Royal Strollers,” the brightest en-

another of the defects of the Palace —the
sides of the building are not made of
elastic. This is bad luck for all concerned
except the treasurer, who has even now as
much work as he hankers after. Still, any
man who travels as treasurer with a ven-
triloquist like Sydney James, and a dancer

The Australian-made picture, “A Hero of

ture it is right in the first order of stars;

turned out a few good ones, and has done
more than his share in making “On Our
Selection” a stayer. But his desire to be-
come fat and wealthy has led him to write
“My Mate,” and George Marlow’s equally
keen desire to become fatter and wealthier
than Duggan will lead to the appearance of
“My Mate” at the Adelphi on Saturday.

Australia most loves to laugh at. Perfervid
patriots complain that national self-esteem
gets rough handling in the Rudd family
circle, and they want to know how Dave, the
son of Dad, came to be born with a panto,
nose. But seeing that Uncle, the brother of
Dad, has. an even wickeder nose than his
nephew, it can be argued that freaks of
nature run in the family. Absurdity is the
soul of humor in the Steele Ruddian scenes,
anyhow. The most popular situations would
fail if they were a little less grotesque. For

The Bert Bailey co. has shed only two or
three of its originals since “Our Selection”
first came to Melbourne. Miss Pearl Smith,
as the unaccountably polished Kate Rudd, is
a pleasing newcomer; likewise J. B. Fowler,
as Billy Bearup, the young bloke whose
anaemic tones are soothing to Sarah and
damnable to Dad; and, finally, J. Walsh, as
the brief transitory parson who recoils from
the odor of the long-hatched egg. The others
are as before, and time has mellowed their
bush creations. Bailey’s tyrannically humane
Dad, Laura Roberts’s petulant Sarah (a
trifle younger than ever), and Macdonald’s
weirdly-natural Dave are the best of them.
Hastings, Duggan and Miss Adeson lead the
rest of the field, and the spirit of local in-
terest pervades everything.

“Potash and Perlmiitter,” as expected,
jumped plonk into the sympathies of the
Chosen, and all .Jerusalem the Golden is
flocking to Melbourne Royal. The Gentiles,
too, find plenty of entertainment, but very
little truth, in the commercial life of amiable
Potash and estimable Perlmiitter. The unique
“office” of those Sheenior wranglers is begirt
with coats and gowns of many colors, and
some of the insults they hurl at on 6 another
are bright remarks, of a sort. The first act,
consisting mainly of rags and gags, is a
rather startling novelty; the other two acts
have happy conversational moments. For in-
stance, Mrs. Potash (the full-blown “Rosie”
of the piece). observes that whereas a spin-
ster dress-designer can always give notice to
her employer, “a vife has got to stick” in
her situation, which strikes the nail of connu-
biality right on its bald head, so to speak.
J.C.W. Ltd. will do very well with “Potash
and Perlmiitter.” The name-partners have
broadened their excitability since the first
night, and any points that may have been
generally overlooked at the outset are now
jabbed into the audience’s understanding with
prodigious force.

Only qne more week of waning attractive-
ness remains to “The Girl on the Film,” at
Melbourne Majesty’s, for on the last day of
the month the ever-welcome “Chocolate Sol-
dier” will be revived with Workman in his
original part of Bumerli. The foolishness of
the present “Girl” production might
have been overlooked for the sake of
two such winsome and well-contrasted
charmers as Dorothy Brunton and Daisy
Yates. But the latter missed-fire on
the first night because she had bathed in
the flour-bin; and her exceeding whiteness
suggested a spectre rather than a private
secretary. Besides, the transparency of her
frock distracted attention from her poetry of
motion in the charming waltz-song item in
the last act. Now that she wears a maiden’s
blush on her cheek, and spells her flower of
beauty with “w,” instead of “u,” and is suffi-
ciently opaque as regards her pink figure—
well, now Miss Yates is sweeter than the
honeycomb. She’s the stuff that angels are
made of.

At Melbourne Tivoli there is nothing newer
for the moment than the Randell Jackson
Concert Co. (six nights only) and Clemons
and Dean, who are topnotch in musical-
comedy duetting. The Balthus Trio and Paul
Stephens fill the gymnastic want. Galvin is a
trickster who talks, and Risden and Carroll
talk without tricking, fend the Monkeys
trick without talking. So the programme
gets you all ways.
The Orchestral Concert which Ezio Kost
conducted at Melbourne Town Hall last
Saturday afternoon was strongest in the first
half. Bazzini’s “Saul” overture and Tschi-
kowski’s “Italian Caprice” (first time in
Melbourne) are equally melodious and
forceful, with a stirring finale in both
cases. The third number, a violin
solo “romance” (Svensden), with light
orchestral accompaniment, brought Stan-
islaus Tarczynski to the fore. He is the
long-haired youth of uncertain age who re-
sembles early portraits of D. G. Rossetti,
and is ordinarily the violin leader of the
band. Stanislaus’s playing is quite in keep-
ing with his appearance. He has a beauti-
fully delicate touch and sweet tone, but he
lacks devil. The orchestra could show no
special reason for performing Dvorak’s
“American Symphony.” It sounds very
like a waste of talent, for the most part. The
next orchestral will be a Patriotic Fund
concert on the 31st, and the fourth >of the
series on August 21, both conducted by W. A.
Laver.

“The Wedding Ring,” which arrived at

sibly be associated with mere men and women.
Few of the “Ladies” and “Gentlemen” de-
serve the labels, however, two or three males
being unsavory Blokes, while a young person
named Violet is no better than a Female.
Violet is the bad girl of the play who crowns
a reputation for hard lying and wickedness
by blaming the Rev. Armstrong for her un-
lawful baby. The parson, of course, is
kicked out of the village, and is dedicated to
a strenuous garret existence on a capital of
Is. 7d. and two old tram tickets. There
is no need for The Bulletin to dilate on
this portion of his career, but it may be
briefly stated that he suffers from various
woes, from bailiffs and leaky roofs to tight
boots and despair, while his wife goes blind,
his cheild perishes, and he is nearly hanged
on a charge of murder. The clouds roll
tardily by after the persecuted hero has
gone to war as a soldier of the King, the
belated sunshine being due to the efforts of
a gang which has employed: much coin and
constructive perjury to ruin- the poor man.
Peter Fletcher (J. J. Ennis) is the head of
those miscreants, and George Fletcher (Her-
bert Linden) is his brutal son. A decrepit
wreck with a nose like a torch acts as Hon-
orary Liar to the party. Violet (Miss Oriel
Hotson) also renders independent aid at
odd moments, but her tongue is a luxury
which only a moneyed villain could afford
to hire. The Good Brigade, valiantly com-
manded by the Rov. Armstrong (George
Cross) and Mrs. Armstrong (Vera Remee),
includes a Jook, a Duchess and a Lord, thus
happily demolishing the common bellow-
dramatic delusion that blood and fine breed-
ing are inconsistent with virtuous conduct.
Next Saturday “The Girl Without a Home”
will look for lodgings.

At Melbourne Bijou this week the only
matter of moment is the arrival of Hennessy
and Martell, two comedy jugglers who are
somewhat extravagant in the exercise of
their gifts. In the second part of the bill

continues to make the Bijou a place within

“The Man Who Stayed at Home” is a big
success at Adelaide Royal. This is due to
the originality of the plot, the personality
of Frank Harvey as the hero, and the excel-
lence of the cast. “Perfect in every detail,”
claims the management modestly, and really
there is not much room for cavil —except as
to thin places in the story, and they are
skated over cleverly. The Tivoli counters
smartly with , “For King and Country,”
which doesn’t stay-at-home a ha’porth, but
goes to “Wipers” and other foreign parts,
and blows the scent of gunpowder over the
footlights. _ A fine, full-blooded play, acted
for all it is worth by Brandon Cremer’s Co.
The King’s has the only local variety show.
Walker and Bunting do a Scotch turn, but
the Bletsoes are still the mainstay. Brewster
Jones has given a fine orchestral concert at
the Exhibition for a patriotic fund, and the
Steele-Paynes, doing the same things in a
different way each week, steadily attract at
the Town Hall.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Sic Transit”: Ellen Terry was prodigal
of compliments when she got back to Eng-
land after her visit to Australia. “My only
regret,” she said, “is that Henry Irving and
I did not go out to Australia years ago when
we were first invited.” The Williamson-
Musgrove people regretted it, too, at the
time; but as they wanted Irving to play only
certain pieces, and the big star desired to
produce others, the result was inevitable.
Henry Irving was hardly the man, in those
days of success, to give in.; and George Mus-
grove, who had the handling of this venture,
was equally independent, not to say obsti-
nate. So this continent never saw Henry,
and only welcomed Ellen when she was a
dear old lady who ought to have been at
home knitting bootees for the grand-
children.
Died this week in Melbourne Mrs. Yic-
torine Pett, an excellent pianist, who under
Smythe’s management was associated with
the eminent composer Horsley in perform-
ances up to half a century ago, and likewise
with the Simonsens. She had considerable
financial success, too, in connection with
the “Penny Readings,” which had great
vogue till vaudeville knocked them out.
Two more mummers have enlisted during
the last few days—good luck to them! One,
Stuart Clyde, was seen of late in various
Nellie Stewart productions. The other is
young George Chalmers, the promising actor
and assistant stage-manager with the Muriel
Starr company. George Chalmers, his
father, has for a good few years been a
respected member of the various J. C. Wil-
liamson companies, but before he became a
mummer he earned distinction as a soldier.
He was in the 17th Lancers and saw a lot
of active service in South Africa. In the
big Zulu war he got too near to one of the
blackfellow’s assegais, and the wound he
then received in one of his legs has left a
scar to be proud of.
The J. C. Williamson picture film, “With-
in Our Gates,” is a laudable attempt to
stimulate recruiting. A home-bred Hun gets
a financial grip of an Australian-German
young man in the Melbourne War Office
and forces him to copy papers, . which the
out-and-out Hun turns toj‘wileless account,
the wireless s)lant being in ~hrs\'.attic.'! But
he has a fair adopted daughter (a very
dangerous possession for a spy) who loves
the War Minister’s son and gives the game
away. Hence the soy is euchred, and the
Australian transports get safely to Egypt.
Both the hero-lover and the penitent Austra-
Teuton go to Gallipoli, where the latter suc-
cumbs to a Turkish bullet whilst he is res-
cuing the hero from a tight place. So he
dies happy, purged of his treachery as re-
gards the “papers.” The melodrama, devised
by W. J. Lincoln, introduces a lot of mili-
tary spectacle, and the storming of the
Gallipoli cliffs tickled up the soldier section
of the audience when the film was submitted
to private view at Her Majesty’s (Melb.).
A building now disappearing from Staf-
ford-street, Dunedin (M.L.), by special re-
quest of the health officer, was, the city’s first
theatre, The Corinthian. The Royal Prin-
cess (opened March 4, ’62) and the Royal
(opened July 12, ’62) were second and
third. f
“Harrison O.” : Preliminary press pars, led
me to suppose that "Potash and Perlmiitter”
was a play, but I now know that these are
the names of two Hebrew comedians who
are presenting a long-drawn-out vaudeville
turn at Melbourne Royal. The turn would
be bearable, although by no means original,
if restricted to 20 minutes; but Perlmiitter
weighs in with his first derisive comment on
Potash’s phiz before eight o’clock, and Potash
does not project his final insult at Perl-
miitter until after eleven. During the
three hours there is an almost uninter-
rupted exchange of cross-talk, constructed in
the belief that one bad jape deserves another,
and that malapropisms are the soul of wit.
In previous communiques I have deplored
the Yankee habit of making one-act playlets
into three-act dramas, but this labelling of
a patter turn as a play is the limit in the
wa k y of impudence.
“Stargaite^’’: “Potash and Perlmiitter,”
now at Melbourne lioyal, is particularly
thin in phose elements that are not Yid
comedy, and not too fresh nor tbo comic in
the features that are humorous; Hebrew.
We have had some pretty fair Yankee Yid-
dish fun at the music-halls during the - Jasf:
few years, and with several of these people'
the present frivolous Israelites do not com-
pare favorably. New York is said to have
laughed at Perl and Pot for over a year.
But the Jewish population of New York;'
is enormous. That of Melbourne is not
nearly so dense.
“Mid-Channel”: Has anyone noticed the
striking resemblance of the butler (Chet-
wood) in “The Law of the Land” to the
butler in Shaw’s “You Never Can Tell”? If
they bear no relationship to one another it
looks as if their linen had got mixed in the
wash. By the way, what object have drama-
tists in so often parading butlers as persons
of exceptional tact and inventive genius?
The blundering of the Captain in “The Law”
suggests that he ought to be the butler, and
the butler one of the shining lights of the
Police Investigation Department.
“Norbell”: It’s years ago, and Adolphus
Snorkey was then a promising young actor,
playing in a J.C.W. production in Sydney.
The play was one in which Williamson him-
self took a keen interest, and he used often
to drop in and see an act or two. It was
the last night of the season, and the co. was
leaving for Maoriland the next day. To
celebrate the occasion Snorkey got hope-
lessly loaded and turned up at night in a
shockingly sozzled condition. As luck would
have it his small part was that of a blither-
ing drunk, and this night Snorkey let him-
self go. He capered, and chortled, and
gagged outrageously ; and then suddenly his
bloodshot eye met the freezing ditto of
J.C.W., who was standing in the prompt
entrance, looking as sympathetic as a frozen
fish. Snorkey sobered up hurriedly, and
when the show was over penitently
sought the S.M. “How was I?” he gasped.
“Awful!” barked the S.M. “Tell me ! Do I
go to Auckland to-morrow?” implored Snor-
key, anxiously. Then the S.M. exploded:
“You go down to the Chows and mark a
ticket; your luck’ll beat the wide world!
The guv’nor says you’ve come on wonder-
fully, and told me to put you up £1 a week
for the Maoriland tour!”
These stage-struck folk have no lack of
nerve. In Canada recently one of them
wrote to a Canadian manager. Said he:
“I am the makings of an actor, being the
handsomest man here.” The manager’s
reply: “Dear Sir, —Your King and Country
need you.”
“Jwosp”: It must be dangerous to talk
about lack of plays in 'Murrica. Winthrop
Ames a year ago ran a competition, and his
staff had to trample through 10,000 efforts.
Oliver Morosco recently established a play-
reading factory. In three months the staff
staggered from beneath a pile of 1116, and
handed out 29 it thought worth further con-
sideration.
(Continued on page Slf.)
“Zog”: The Australian Govt, has issued a
list of enemy firms in the Commonwealth,
and attached to it is a warning that trading
with them will be recompensed with weighty
penalties. It might have been simpler to
have taken steps to stop these alien firms
from doing business, but perhaps that would
have inconvenienced the Defence Dept, in re-
gard to its contracts with one of the tabooed
firms. For quite a long while in one port a
German crowd actually did the lighterage
jobs for the transports.
;'V. P. Taylor, the “Captain Penfold” so
■vfell known as a balloonist and parachutist
in Sydney, has joined as a private in the
infantry. He Molds an aviation pilot’s cer-
tificate obtained in England, and has long
ago demonstrated to experts the accuracy
of his bomb-dropping practice. No more
intrepid bird-man flies, and there seems to
be a joint loose somewhere when a man
with such unique qualifications has to join
infantry. The flying corps in the various
battle fronts cannot be so overstocked that
Taylor’s unusual experience would not be
welcomed.
Mud-stained document from a dug-out in
Gallipoli
There are times here which in a manner of speak-
ing might be called trying. The other day Bill and
I and a hard-faced chap from out Nyngan way were
having a sleep and a bit of beef in a cave, when a
shrapnel shell lobbed about 2ft. in front of us, bury-
ing the meat and filling the legs of the Nyngan
cove with gramophone needles. Bill got the “bully”
out and washed it with tea, and I told the h?’-d-
-faced chap we would carry him to a dressing stats i.
He said we’d better finish the meat first, and then
another shell brought the drawing-room down. Bill
lost a couple of teeth and poor old Hardface was
nearly buried. So we took him half a mile to the
doctor and got back in good time, thinking he was
dead. That night Bill and I had to get into the
front trench, and were doing a bit of sniping and
yarning when old Hardface came creeping along
with a rifle and jumped into the trench. He was
wringing wet. “Thank God,” he says, “the only
safe place!” After a while he told us all about it.
When he recovered consciousness he found he was on
a hospital ship at anchor, and everybody was saying
aeroplanes were dropping bombs about, and sub-
marines were serving out torpedoes. “Cripes,” he
says to himself, “the sea’s no place for a bloke from
Nyngan. If I’m goin’ to be hoisted, I’ll have it
ashore.” So when the lights were doused old Hardface
gets out of his bunk, drops overboard and strikes
out for the beach. A picket boat picked him up
and landed him as a spy, but while they were wait-
ing for the Provost-Marshal to investigate him he
slips into the dark, pinched an overcoat and a rifle
from a cove who was looking the other way, and got
a move on. “The firing line for me, every time,”
says Hardface. “A chap gets a bit o’ peace and
quiet here.” Then he lay down and went to sleep
as happy as Larry. .

“The art of the moving-picture actor has its draw-
backs, the chief, Trii the opinion of most members of
the profession, lying in the fact that the performer
misses the pleasure of receiving any expressions of
public appreciation that may be due to him.’’

With ecstasy quite fine;
The perils of the war he braves,
And from the maw of Hades saves
The peerless heroine.
But though no pro. was e’er so grand,
Poor chap, he never gets a hand!
His author’s lines right royally
He spouts, but like a clam
Is all the world. No rabid glee
Breaks from a crowd when fine and free
He roars a raucous “Damn!”
And sad it is, the artistes say,
When no man throws a fat bouquet.

SOCIETY
History is repeating itself in certain Vic.
irrigation regions, where the original water
trusts, built in the interests of the big Rod-
ney landholders, were turned down during
good seasons and only used in bad ones,
with the result that the trusts went broke
and left deficits to be wiped out by the
State. When the 1902 drought arrived
the Campaspe Irrigation Trust had long
gone rusty, but a number of cockies patched
up the fluming channels and secured mois-
ture, the adjoining rich landowners mean-
while sitting back on their purses. But
when the water began to run Stingy and Co.
got up in the dead of night, cut into the
races and got what the other fellow had been
working for. The same dodge has been
worked this year, and the other day a num-
ber of the same old crowd were before the
Court, charged with clandestinely tapping
the supplies trickling past their shrines of
Mammon. Just as had been done at Cam-
paspe, they had helped themselves to neigh-
bors’ measurements from the Waranga sup-
ply. , Each was fined only 10s., the Court
taking the view* that “sweating” water sup-
plies Was a recognised local custom! If the
tables were turned, and > the small and in-
dustrious cocky got up in the night and
helped himself in the same way to the big,
loafing landowners’ sheep, he would get
more like 10 years.
A helping of butter should be reserved
for the Maoriland Arbitration Court, which
has refused to “count in” stewards’ tips as
wages, and has ordered the companies to
pay the men without regard to the stray
half-dollars dropped into their paws by
travellers. The consequence of the system
latterly in force was just what might have
been expected—travellers seeking no more
than reasonable service were blackmailed
into yielding backsheesh for what they had
already contracted with the steamers’ owners
to provide. The system was demoralising
and irritating all round. All the same, the
attempt. to suppress the tip will be a tough
proposition.. The ship’s steward may, and
often does, by trifling attentions, quite out-
side the scope of his ordinary work, make
travel less irksome than it frequently is to
some people ; and there should be no reason
why those attentions should not be grate-
fully recognised. The' merit of the finding is in
putting the steward on a respectable foot-
ing so far as his ordinary task is concerned.

“B. Wilder”: There is a question in the
war census schedule demanding that I shall
state what job I could do other than the one
which habitually yields me my crust. Sup-
posing I put down that I would undertake
to be a cabbage gardener or a Black Rod, the
replies would look absurd when contrasted
with my present status. Yet either might be
quite sincere. My friend Jawwagge will cer-
tainly white that he would undertake to run
Holman’s imported trawlers, and he believes
he could, though he doesn’t know the differ-
ence between the garboard strake and a
schnapper’s tail. Chiffon has more than
once confided to me that his true destiny is
on the western plains ; yet he couldn’t bail
up a tame Strawberry to save his life. There
are great possibilities in this census, and if
Fisher, starts shifting us all round into new
jobs, how bright a flare will be cast on the
inward yearnings of the human soul! John
Murray, I understand, is eager to grapple
with the job of a lighthouse-keeper ; George
Black insists on firing a trawler; Wade
thinks of becoming a gravedigger; Johr
Forrest a waiter at a quick-lunch countei;
Julius Knight, I am not surprised to learn,
dreams of some time being a tram-conductor.
What a day it will be when Hughes, acting
under the stern necessity of the hour, orders
this lot to get busy and fill the breach in
order that other men may be released for
military service. Then Fisher will come
round and turn Archbishop Wright into a
railway porter, while Chief Justice Cullen
realises his dearest wish by becoming a
wheeler at Stockton; Dick Meagher is hitched
to the stern of a plough; and Adrian Knox,
back from Egypt, is turned into a traffic
policeman- For myself, I am going to ex-
press preference for a job as a butter-dealer.

If St. Mary’s Cathedral can manage to
collar a slice of street for an approach, it
won't be the first tabernacle in Sydney to
do it. In 1834 the Legislature passed an
Act for regulating the alignments of the
streets of Sydney, disallowing any person
to build within 12ft. of the outer kerbstone
of any, street. Five yeats later another Act
was passed giving St. James’s permission to
go out three feet. A year later Parliament
passed another Act allowing St. Patrick’s,
on Church Hill, to go to within the same
nine feet of the kerb. The two encroach-
ments still exist, and offer a far more violent
bump to the public than the proposed St.
Mary’s grab.
AN ODIOUS COMPARISON.
MRS. BULSTER: “ You’re too hard on the poor woman. Everybody likes her.”
MR. BULSTER: "Yes, in that respect she’s very like an onion—something everybody likes

While the I‘ecruiting fever raged in Vic-
toria and everybody urged everybody else
to go and enlist, one fearful enthusiast in-
vaded the grounds of Melbourne Benevolent
Asylum, and was interrupted in the midst
of a fervent address calling upon the vener-
able and decrepit residents to throw off their
lethargy, march to the' Town Hall and fight
for the Empire.
FOR KING AND COUNTRY.
THE ONE: “Good Heavens, Wiggins, what have you been doing to your head?”
THE OTHER: “Well, you see, dear hoy, a man has to show some patriotic feeling these
days, so I’ve been and had a military `haircut.”
'‘Lagani-Namo”: In March last one
McKay, a native-labor recruiter, set out
from Lindenhafen for Rabaul (New Guinea)
per launch, with several natives. They put
in to a village en route and the “boys” stole
a pig - . As they were cooking it on the beach
a mob of yelling natives leapt out from
the jungle and massacred them. Then
they killed the white man, put his body on
a canoe, and cast it away out to sea.
That’s the official version. Here’s another,
which is that of persons better acquainted
with the gentle nigger thereabout. McKay
had been trading up and down that coast-
line and was very popular amongst the
natives —too well regarded for them to kilt
him over a pig, anyhow. The killing was
more likely by way of reprisal for offences
of a much more serious nature committed
by other white men who touched there a
little previously—either Germans or some of
our own expeditionary troops. From this
and other allegations equally serious, it looks
as though a Commission should have been
sent before this to investigate.

John George Gilmore, awarded three
years for forgery at Wagga (N.S.W.) last
week, turned out to have been convicted 13
times since 1910 for the same offence. It
is odd how the criminal specialises. In a
ga.ol handy to Sydney you can see the weak,
mild, hopeful countenance of the suburban
grocer who pushes the domestic pram on a
Sabbath afternoon. “An habitual,” says one
of the warders; “he steals the washing off

thing else so far as the police can find out.
In the presence of a fiver he is honest; faced
by a shirt or an undervest he becomes a
dangerous malefactor. In the same gaol
there is an ex-clergyman who has com-
mitted more forgeries than anyone can
count. He also is a “Kathleen Mavourn-
neen.” He has never been guilty of any-
thing but writing other people’s names. And
so with the institution’s burglars, garrotters
and others. About the only non-specialists
are the murderers. Few make a life’s
hobby of assassination, though there have
been the usual exceptions in such as Deem-
ing and Butler.
Christchurch (M.L.) has a scheme to send
females to Cairo or any other old place to
nurse the Dominion’s wounded soldier. The
ladies are to be in charge of a medical man
and a qualified nurse, but the rank and file
will be “amateur” nurses drawn from the
Pancake City’s “society.” The name of the
organisation is to be the M.L. Volunteer
Sisters, and it is to be entirely unofficial.
The first day the thing was mooted there
was a stampede of the “best” people to
volunteer, and over 200 names were handed
in almost before the thing was born. But
Minister of Defence Allen has been sniffing
suspiciously, and he may yet say that the
best in the way of trained nurses are. none

At a gathering of Melbourne’s “Ancient
Mariners,” a fiery member of the crew waxed
splendidly scornful regarding the allegations
of “panic” aboard the Lusitania during the
vessel’s 14 last minutes afloat. “Panic!”
roared the ancient. “Did you ever see a
woman crossing a crowded street with three
kids? Panic on a crowded ship where ex-
plosions were happening! Panic? There
were 500 Irishmen down below, and it was
full of smoke and steam after the first tor-
pedo came, and only six men at a time could
climb out of the hell! Panic!” And the
excited mariner left it to his audience to
wonder whether there was room for much
else besides Panic in those crowded 14
minutes.

“Parisine” : The French procession in Mel-
bourne on Bastille Day outshone all local
precedent. How swiftly have the sands in
the hour-glass run of late! A purely upper-
class affair this ; yet only a year ago a Bas-
tille celebration was denounced as anar-
chical ! The historical pageant was in-
structive. First the early pioneers of
France, ' a savage in leopard-skin and a
scantily-clad Diana. Then Gaul and Roman
soldiers,, and mounted courtiers of the Medi-
aeval period. A waggon full of the young-
sters of that time, drawn by oxen, was
effective. Charlemagne on his throne, with
his queen, came along. Then Gue.sclin,
antagonist of the Black Prince, with squire.
Bayard next, in armor, with Joan of Arc
and attendants; jesters ; Henry of Navarre,
with the Chief Constable of France; Maz-
arin, with Louis the Fourteenth, M’d’lle de
la Valliere and other ladies, leading on to
the Duke and Duchess of Guise, Marie
Antoinette, Josephine, and Napoleon—
taken to the life by Pierre Bellew —accom-
panied by Murat and Ney. Robespierre
was suggested by a group of woinen-at-
tackers of the Bastille, with a cannon.
Lastly France surrounded by all the virtues.
Altogether a great astonishment to the
public, showing how the spectacular is done
in France —and Germany, too. Certainly
we will see more of it.
ITALIANO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The tinted heights of Genoa, are glorious in the sun
That gets on peace that war has brought—new history
begun;
New history for Italy, new history for the world,
The Flag of Honor high above dishonored flags
unfurled.
The message came to Naples, the message came to
Rome,
To Florence and to Venice to call past glories home;
The deep, cool streets of Genoa hold hearts with fire
a-glow,
Where women by the fountain wash fair linen white
as snow.
Vesuvius glows by Naples now on her midsummer
nights;
The moon hangs full o’er Naples With her long,
straight lines of lights;
On barren coasts of Italy and islands strangely lone
That won this heart of mine because they seemed so
like our own.
The moonlight gleams jn Rome to-night on living
statues there -,
The glorious stars in Venice are mirrored every-
where ;
And thoughts of Florence and the past make my
dimmed eyes more dim,
AVhence marched a mate of mine to war—and I
would I were with him!

One of the swindles adopted by time-pay-
ment peddlers was handed up for inspection
the other day by the beaks at Prahran
(Vic.). In June the firm had brought an
action against a married woman to recover
a few pounds on a time-payment piano. The
hearing was adjourned, in consequence of the
Bench getting a letter from the woman stat-
ing that she hadn’t any money, but had
eight children. The Clerk wrote to the
woman stating that the case had been ad-
journed. A week later she wrote in reply
enclosing a communication from the furni-
ture people, in which they informed her that
the case had been heard —which was a lie —
that a verdict had been given in their favor
for £lO, with ss. costs —which was more lie
—and that unless immediate settlement was
made a fraud summons would issue—which
was an attempt to extract the money by
false pretences. When the case really did
come up, the Court jumped with unanimous
feet on the plaintiffs, said the only order
would be for payment of one shilling, and
ordered that all documents be im-
pounded. As an exactly similar case was
mentioned on the same day, it would appear
as if the Law had stumbled over a common
piece of roguery.
HIS LINE.
THE M AN: “Going to the Front? Sorry,
can't! I’m the last representative of
our line, y’know.”
THE W OMAN: “ Pardon, quite forgotten your

Henry Newton, the unassuming Austra-
lian who succeeds the equally unassuming
Gilbert White as Anglican Bishop of Car-
pentaria, will be overseer of the largest

Gulf country in Queensland from which it
is named, and the Cape York Peninsula
from Port Douglas up, finishing with the
Torres Strait islands, one of which —Thurs-
day—is the “see city.” The “cathedral”
of the diocese —named All Souls’, on Thurs-
day Island —has the distinction of being the
smallest cathedral in the world. Not larger

than many a backblocks Methody chapel, it
possesses nevertheless a feature of unique
interest in the mementoes of shipping disas-
ters which it contains. A ship’s riding light
is its altar lamp; a compass bowl serves as
a font; altar, lectern, pulpit and seats are
made from the timbers or fittings of various
bygone vesels; lifebuoys hang about its
walls; and almost every minor article of
furniture or ornament (including the bell)
recalls some hooker which left her bones —
and in many cases, her crew’s also—piled
up on the reefs of Torres Strait. The building
itself is a memorial to the people lost in the
wreck of the Quetta.
Henry Newton is the first old student of
the Anglican College at Sydney Uni. to be-
come a bishop, though the similar institu-
tion (Trinity), at Melbourne, has produced
six pairs of gaiters—Stretch (of Newcastle,
N.S.W.), Stephen (of Tasmania), Green
(of Ballarat), Armstrong (of Wangaratta),
Long (of Bathurst), and Sadlier (of Nel-
son, M.L.) numberless mere spats,
such as archdeacons and deans. Probably
as a result of the Protection policy to which
they were accustomed, Vie. Anglicans early
recognised that the home-grown product
could bish as well as. if not better than, the
imported article. Their co-religionists in
N.S.W. clung to the Preetrade fetich, and
religiously imported till quite recently when-
ever a mitre wanted a new head to fit it. A
number of more or less Outback sees in Aus-
tralia —including Carpentaria, North-West
Australia and Willochra —now have bishops
who are Australian trained, and in some
cases Australian born; but Hobart, the
smallest capital city in the Commonwealth,
is the only metropolis which has an Aus-
tralian native as its Anglican bishop, and
that has been only since last year. All the
other capitals have consistently imported. It
is time the Australian got some of the billets
in his own country which are lucrative as
well as honorable. Mere-Australian New-
ton, at Carpentaria, will have to keep his
apron tidy on a screw of about £6 per week,
and his travelling will be done by packhorse,
sailing cutter and boot; imported Arch-
gaiters Wright, of Sydney, manages to pay
for his motor tyres and sleeping berths on a
laborer’s hire of something over £7 per day.

A South Melbourne citizen was fined £lO
last week for biting a policeman’s finger off
at the first joint. He pleaded that he was
too drunk to know who he was fighting
or what'he had got his teeth into. Had the
cannibal bitten the policeman’s head off and
lost all recollection of it the Bench would
probably have fined him at least £2O. It
would be interesting to know now how much
a bench of constables would fine a drunk
for chewing a Jay Pee.
“Jane,” from the other side: —
Shells have put monocles at a heavy discount along
the firing-line. In Paris the other day the wife or
'an officer who wears a monocle on account of a
'slight myopia told me about what happened to
hubby. He had been wounded, and on recovery
went up for examination by the regimental doctor,
wearing his usual little window. “Whistle!” com-
manded Sawbones. Henri whistled. “Hum!” said
Sawbones, and called a colleague. “Whistle some
more,” requested the newcomer. Henri obliged and
got his certificate, but -with a note which causes
every doctor who sees it to suddenly say “Whistle!”
/Henri has written home to say that after the Huns
have been dealt with he will take a job as a loco-
motive. The explanation is that a man appearing
with a look-out screwed over his eye is susppcted of
trying to qonceal facial paralysis by shoring; up the
eyelid; and'as a sufferer from this infirmity couldn’t
whistle after a poodle to save his life, the i doctors

“McNorth”: The recent alleged solution of
the mystery surrounding the Marie Celeste, a
sailing ship which was found adrift
in the. Atlantic, abandoned intact
and with all sail set, and with
nothing to indicate what had hap-
pened, reminds me of the adven-
ture of the crew of the Marie
Esebia, a cutter belonging to a
Thursday Island pearling firm. All
hands jumped over-
board some months
ago near Darnley
Island, with the ob-
ject of - securing some
turtles which were
disporting themselves
near by. The cutter,
catching a slant of
wind, slipped away to-
wards the sky-line,
leaving the crew in
the water. The men
were picked up later none the
worse, but by that time the
bolted boat was over the curve
and out of sight. After a sys-
tematic search the runaway
was found on the eastern side
of Cape York, quite unharmed.
She had travelled ' oyer a hun-
dred miles to windward through
a maze of reefs and sandbanks
and islands, where there are
hardly two consecutive miles of open water,
and had dodged the lot.
“F .C.” : The remarks about Bill Jones,
slaughterman, and Hector Mucilage, clerk
(B. 24/6/’l5), remind me of a recent small
commotion among the Melbourne slaughter-
men, who practically all belong to the Vic.
Union. The slaughtermen at a big works
stuck up on the wall of/ the slaying depart-
ment a notice: “None but unionists need
apply.” The boss, who has been in fierce
limelight lately, curtly told the tnanager to
take it down. It was replaced, and again
removed. Then a framed and glazed sign
was screwed to the wall-plate, and the man-
ager Whs given a hint that interference
meant a stoppage of slaughtering. It
stayed, and is still there. Now, imagine the
clerical Mucilage handling his employer in
that fashion!

The deposition of Jas. Poddley, manager
of the Smith-street branch of the R.S.V.P.
Bank: —
I was in my room at the bank. The time was
11.15 a.m. I heard cries. They seemed to come
from the street. I rushed outside and saw Mr.
Blimme, the grocer, who is one of our customers,
standing at the door of his shop. He waved his
arms in a distracted manner, and cried “Gone —-all
gone!” Then drawing a revolver from his pocket
he shot himself in the head, and fell. Most of the
crowd now joined in the pursuit of the robber. I
called for a doctor, but met with no response.
Looking more closely at Mr. Blimme, I realised that
I could do nothing. He was quite dead. I accord-
ingly left him to a policeman and entered the shop.
It is a small place about 20ft. by 10ft. There is a
safe in the basement. It had been opened. Deeds,
bank-notes and a few coins. v were scattered about the
floor. The food-compartment was empty. I noticed
a tunnel leading beneath the street. It is possible
that it communicated With' the bank premises. The
earth appeared to be freshly 'turned, and I observed
what ''looked' like newly-made footsteps. The foot-
steps were large, and might correspond with the
boots shown me, and alleged to have been worn by
Herbert Pobble, who was one of my clerks. Pobble
is a married man with three children. Do not know
that he is a heavy eater, but have heard rumors
that his wife has been eating inordinately of late,
and that, 'the children alsp eat.. Know nothing else to
his discredit.' ■' < t. .
Returning to r th'e. bank I was asked by the police to
step down to thd vaults. My .-attention was drawn
to a tunnel similar 10. that, which I had seen in Mr.
Blimme’s basement. I was “given to understand
that it communicated with the shop. It is possible
that Herbert Pobbje could gain access to the vaults
and so construct the tunnel. None of the bank’s
gold was touched. There are no provisions on the
premises. The' bank’s food-reserve is kept in a
strong-room at the head, office.
I identified Pobble at the police-station about an
hour after his capture: He looked as though he had
been eating. He smelt of: fopd. Inspector O’Toole
formally charged him . with “breaking and entering
the premises of William Henry Blimme, and stealing
therefrom of butter.” I said, “How could you
do it, Pobble? Frenzied by his loss, Blimme has
shot himself.” For a moment he seemed moved, and
then his face hardened, and he said: “Well, anyhow,
I got about a pound of it'"down before they caught
me. if was worth it.” He was then led to the cells.
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
“Did you hear about Gertie at the party? It
was a very proper party, but her dress
was cut awfully low.”
“Yes?”
“And it showed the whole bust.”
“Yes'?”
“Well, bust the whole, show.”

The remarkable improvement in the hair
that has so frequently and invariably' been
reported following the use of a simple hair
remedy composed of loz. Lavona de Com-
posee, -4 dram Menthol Crystals and 3oz.
Bay Rum has caused such widespread in-
terest and comment that many chemists
now keep it put up complete and ready for
use under the name of Lavona Hair Tonic.
Its uniform success in destroying dandruff,
stopping falling hair, promoting hair growth
and making thin, dry, brittle hair thick,
soft, glossy and luxuriant, has been so
astonishing that the manufacturers of
Lavona Hair Tonic, in order to show their
unlimited confidence in its merits, have
arranged with leading chemists everywhere
to sell it under an absolute guarantee of
satisfaction or money back, signed by the
chemist from whom you purchase it. No
claim is made that Lavona Hair Tonic is
any better than that which any chemist
can prepare from the above formula, but, if
you wish to convince yourself of its truly
remarkable merits without risking the loss
of a penny, go to any good chemist to-dky
and ask for a bottle of Lavona Hair Tonic,
“the kind they guarantee.”*

ITEMS
The absurdity of the idea that mere
colonials could make shells is emphasised by
the fact that Colin Carr, of Rotorua (M.L).
an engineer by calling, is one of the three
British Government inspectors at a big steel
and shrapnel factory near Pittsburg
(U.S.A.), where shifts are working night
and day turning out munitions for the Allies.
Walter Lewis, an elderly Melbourne solici-
tor who died the other day. was chiefly
remarkable for his connection with the
ancient firm of Lewis and Whitty, a concern
which for many years has supplied starch,
soap and essence of lemon to Victorian kit-
chens. Lewis married a daughter of Ball
the draper. Ball and Welch, ages ago, had
an obscure shop in an otherwise shopless
street at Carlton. Advertisements of special
lines brought the public along, and in those
days Carlton saw “carriage folk” in quanti-
ties, their vehicles being lined up along dirty
old Drummond-street while the dowager from
within went into Ball’s to buy a line of
undercut calico. Nowadays, Ball and Welch
have their shop near the cathedral, and serve
more dowagers than ever. Lewis twice
tried to get into the Victorian Assembly, but
the nearest he ever approached to being an
M.P. was when he became a municipal coun-
cillor at Malvern.

' Died last week Dr. 11. L. Atkinson, of
Bendigo, one of Victoria’s richest men. But
it wasn't for his supply of money so much
as for his supply of wives that the Bendigo
Beehive held him famous. Twenty-five years
ago it used to be said that he kept a list of
eligibles. Four wives he had thusfar buried
without getting flustered. A fifth risked it
—he was already wealthy—and she out-
lasted him. He socked away a good deal of
his money in grazing land outside Bendigo,
and as the mines grew less profitable he had
the satisfaction of seeing chops go up to a
shilling or so. He was tv ell over 80.
. One of the last of Australia’s “forty-
niners” dropped out at Launceston (TasA
the other day, when James Spotswood shifted
camp. The son of a British army captain
who, after fighting against Napoleon, settled
in Tasmania, James went off to California
in ’49, hunting for the gold he could have
found nearer home, struck it rich and made
a nice little fortune. When this had been
spent he went to the diggings again,
guessing another rise was easy to make.
But James was wrong that time. He
panned out 93 years.
C. R. E. Childers, eldest son of R. J. E.
Childers, of Chinchilla (Q.), has gone into
the Naval College at Jervis Bay. He is a
grandson of H. C. E. Childers, Collector of
Customs in the first Ministry in Victoria,
subsequently a member of the House of Com-
mons. and at different times First Lord of
the Admiralty, War Minister, Chancellor of
the Exchequer and Home-Secretary in three
of Gladstone’s Cabinets. The new cadet
had a naval uncle who was drowned
in the Captain catastrophe in 1870. This
ironclad turret ship capsized in a squall,
drowning her designer and 469 other per-
sons.
MANY INVENTIONS.
BIGGINS: “ Very inventive race, the Ger-
mans.”
LIGGINS: "Marvellous! I Have you read of

Died last week, almost simultaneously
with liis old friend Dr. Atkinson, I. E.
Dyason, who had been connected with the
Lansell interests at Bendigo for half a cen-
tury, and in his time represented them on
half-a-liundred Boards. “Jimmy'’ North-
cote was liis off-sider; and the best way to
get into their favor was to be able to belt
or blow sweet sounds out of some instrument.
Dyason’s chief contribution to music was
the pianiste daughter who married Professor
Scott the other day. Dyason learned wis-
dom from the sacrifice of many blocks of
shares in other “deceased” estates. He
fixed up a scheme for Lansell. and lie im-
proved upon it when forming the Dyason
Proprietary to hold and carry on liis own
interests.
The relict of David Simpson Kirkwood.
C.E., died in Sydney last week in her 83rd
year. When she was born her father, Rob-
ert Cooper, then living at Juniper Ilall, Old
South Ilead-road (Sydney), had the only
distillery of any consequence in Australia.
It was known as the Brisbane, and was
in George-street West —“about a mile from
the town on the Parramatta-read,” as a
paper of the time described it. “Here, too,
cordials of all descriptions and of excellent
flavor are prepared. The buildings are of
white freestone and seated upon a fine little
stream of water surrounded by a high stone
wall within which are granaries, malt
houses, a water wheel and every requisite
for carrying on an extensive trade.” The
spirit produced from local grain was said
to be “very similar to London gin.”
Of the seven Henty brothers who founded
the first settlement in Victoria, only three

grandson. They are, respectively, Captain
de Witt Ilenty (surgeon), Lieut. Edward
Henty and Private Arthur Ilenty. Also on
the warpath with a Maoriland regiment is
Ilichmond Henty, a great-grandson of Ste-
phen : and on the way to England to finish
his flying education is Edric Ilenty, a great-
grandson of James. The great-grandsons of
John are not yet old enough to do any fight-
ing, except in the nursery for porridge.
In a private letter Australian aviator
Harry Hawker mentions casually that he re-
ceived the D.S.O. for a one-man aerial raid
on a Gerhog air-shed at Ghent on June 10.
The shed was guarded by a captive balloon
carrying snipers, so Hawker manoeuvred into
a position directly beneath the balloon,
between it and the shed. Neither the Huns
in the air nor those on the ground could do
much firing for fear of hitting each other,
and among the bombs the Australian was
able to drop was one from a height of only
200 ft. This caused an explosion which did
Germany no good.
“G.D.M.” reminisces
This ought to bo a threnody, a Jeremiad, a note
of woe to everybody living in the uttermost parts
of the earth who had the good luck to be born in
Bendigo. Dr. Harry Leigh Atkinson is dead, and so
is Isaac Edward Dyason! Two really great men,
and, like all truly powerful men, modest, quiet, self-
contained. Dr. Atkinson was an oculist from the
same town in Yorkshire as Dr. Hincheliff. the con-
summately-clever surgeon who gave good advice to
two generations of Bendigonians. When 13 years
old I stuck a schoolboy’s rusty knife in my right
eye. Dr. Atkinson saved the sight by an incompar-
able operation, afterwards approved by such leading
oculists as Sir George Anderson Critchett, Professor
Pagenstecker (Wiesbaden), and the leonine Dr. Rob-
ertson, of Edinburgh. Atkinson helped George
Lansell, Ernest Mueller, William Hunter and Isaac
Edward Dyason to keep Bendigo alive. His was
the master mind. Able by intensity to the nth power
of human capacity, Dr. Atkinson backed George
Lansell, the Quartz King, in every one of his enter-
prises. Personally T was born in the Camp Reserve.
Bendigo, in a little, old Milestone building right
on the creek, and then known as the Bank of Vic-
toria. When three months old my mother came to
the conclusion that George Lansell’s soap-boiling
factory behind the Bank of X. S. Wales in View
Point was hurting my “health. So Papa Moudell, of
the Bank of Victoria ; Dick Bannerman, of the
Bank of N. S. Wales; John Hasker, of the Colonial
Bank; and William Tees, of the Union Bank, with
Father Backhaus, the R.O.- prelate, waited on George
Lansell and bought him out for £2500, which he
promptly put into the Garden Gully United tributes,
and thereby concocted two millions sterling of
delightful cash. I think Malcolm Tolmie attended
the deputation with Billy ITeffernan.
The two subjects of this eulogium did more than
George Lansell to develop Bendigo. Lansell had
plenty pluck and very little else; which one is per-
mitted to say, because courage always leads intel-
lect. Dr. Atkinson and Dyason stuck to it, worked
bard, paid calls, never missed directors’ meetings,
and when George Lansell was faint-hearted about
deep-sinking these two able men kept him up to the
mark. Dyason and Atkinson, with Bill Hunter and
Ernest Mueller, paid calls and sank their dividends
in such mines as Catherine Reef United, United
Hustlers and Redan, Great Britain (120 culls),
Great Southern Garden Gully, New Chum Railway,
and a number of other “stringers” whose shafts I’ve
been down and whose names I forget. Dyason,
amongst other things, was an expert accountant, and
that faculty of accountancy made much towards his
and George Lansell’s success. Bendigo’s annual gold
yield will drop further through the death of these
strong men.
Maoriland lost an energetic explorer when
Lieut. Lyttle stopped a bullet in Galliooh.
Lyttle had devoted a lot of time to the wild
region east of Milford Sound. In 1900-7 he
made a trip over McKinnon’s Pass by the
Milford Track ; the following
year, with Grave, Talbot
and Gifford, he abandoned
the beaten track and trav-
elled by way of the Route-
burn and Hollyford Valleys,
Moraine Creek and _ Bake
Adelaide, and during 13 days
of continual rain did most
of his grazing on cress and
snow grass. On this trip a
fine, thousand-feet drop was
found near Lake Adelaide,
and is now known as Lyt-
lle’s Falls. More recently,
Lyttle was one of Grave’s
party that set out to dis-
cover a route from the head
of Wakatipu to Milford.
They brought Grave’s Pass
to light, and mapped out the
new track now being cleared
to the famous sound. Five
years ago he, with Grave and
Talbot, scaled Balloon Peak,
until then reckoned unclimbable.
It was when the —ah —Labah party was
in its early days of power, and W. M.
Hughes was getting a grip of the External
Affairs portfolio. Atlee Hunt, the secretary,
was determined, while rendering loyal ser-
vice to his new chief, to see that the great
literary traditions of the secretarial side
received due kow-tow. In this atmosphere
a report on the New Hebrides Condominium,
written in French, arrived. Hunt placed it
on the boss’s table: with the suave intima-
tion : “The report is in French —shall I read
it to you, sir?” “Oh. no,” said Billy, “just
leave it there, and I’ll read it when I get
time.” Silence. A day or two later
another report arrived, and was similarly
introduced. “Is it in French this time?”
asked Billy, without shifting an eyelid. “No,
sir—in English,” says Hunt. “Then I
think that on this occasion you may read
it.” was the verdict, given with the air of
one who had taken the temperature with
great care.
Sydney has a police sergeant who has
passed the examinations qualifying him for
appointment as police magistrate. The
officer, by name Mankey, has been prosecutor
in the Sydney Central Court; but
the Department now puts his special know-
ledge to better use by making him instructor
of police recruits at the depot.
ARCHBISHOP KELLY crosses the street
on a wet day.
Ilori Pahuki, the last of the older genera-
tion of Maori chiefs of the Wairarapa
(M.L.), passed over the other day. He was
alleged to be 112 years old ; but that
merely the usual old rumor that attacks
every excessively wrinkled ancient. Ilori
was of the Ngatikahungunu, a tribe that
left a record of very impolite performances.
"GET INTO KHAKI.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Get into khaki.”—lE. A. Holman.
Who is that prophet that calls to the Heavens:
“Things are as gloomy as gloomy can be;
War has put biz all at sixes and sevens.
Troubles are looming for Party, you see;
Wanted a chant that shall waken all classes,
Drive ’em to ’listing tumultuously;
‘Get into Khaki’ ’s the cry for the masses—
‘Get into Debt' is the motto for me.
“Why should the Teuton breed ravage and sorrow
Right from the Seine to the Dneister and Bug?
Why should we want while our people can borrow ?
Why should we thirst while there’s beer in the
jug ?
Why don’t they nip up their rifles, those asses,
Roll to the Front like a wave on the sea?
‘Get into Khaki’ ’s the cry for the masses—
‘Get into Debt' is the motto for me.
“War is a curse, for it mops up the millions,
Cuts off a State from the fount of all joy;
Kaiser and Co are a parcel of silly ’uns,
Lunatics pure, without anj r alloy ;
llow the folk stand ’em my wit it surpasses,
Why don’t they rise up, enfranchised and free?
‘Get into Khaki’ ’s the cry for the masses ;
‘Get into Debt’ is the motto for me.
“I have no time for a slouch and a laggard.
I'p, boys, and at ’em's the game 1 admire;
Hope you won’t fancy I'm playing the braggart
When I protest that' my soul is on fire.
Patriot and pawner, ye lads and ye lasses,
This be my fame over highland and lea:
‘Get into Khaki’ ’s the cry for the masses—
‘Get into Debt’ is the motto for me !”

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Following upon the successful issue of the
great British war loan the Commonwealth
Government announces that it proposes to
ask Australian investors, great and small,
to put up £20,000,000 at the same rate of
interest —4J p.c. As, however, the local
issue of a loan of that size would cause a
serious disturbance of private finance, it is
proposed to go to market with only
£5,000,000 at a time; and some concessions
with regard to the payment of interest on
instalments before they are actually in the
Treasury will make the investment worth
about eighteenpence more than the even 44
p.c. As a rule, British Government stocks
command from | to 1 p.c. more than the best
Australian Government securities; so that
the Commonwealth Government does not
propose to err on the side of liberality.
Two concessions, if they were made, would
go a long way towards improving the pro-
spects of the loan and the maintenance of a
quotation at or above par after issue. In
the first place, following British precedent,
the Government might reasonably under-
take to put up the rate to any
higher price at which any subsequent
war-loan might be issued. This would
make all war loans carry the same rate
of interest. The British Government not
only undertakes to do this for those who
applied for the recent loan, but gave the
holders of the first big war loan at 31 p.c.
the right to convert to 41 p.c. on paying up
the 5 p.c. discount (that loan was issued at
31 p.c.) and subscribing for an equal amount
of the new loan. In effect, it says, “Nobody
shall suffer for letting us have their money
now. Nobody who comes in later on shall
get better terms.”
In the second place, the Commonwealth
might well undertake to hereafter during the
currency of the loan accept the stock at par
value in payment of Commonwealth probate
duty. Hundreds of wealthy men, knowing
that their executors are liable for the prompt
payment of as much as 30 p.c. of their estate
in Commonwealth and State, probate duties,
are accumulating cash for the purpose. They
have this money in banks, or in other in-
vestments from which it can be called in
quickly. The Commonwealth would get a
large sum of this money if it would under-
take to later on accept its own war-loan
stock in payment. Further, as these men
accumulated cash towards paying their pro-
bate duty, they would put it into this stock
by purchase, which would assist to keep the
issue at a good price in the market; and
this consideration would influence investors
who are anxious to help in making the loan
a success, but are not sure whether they will
be able to hold on to it indefinitely. The
concession would cost the Commonwealth
nothing in the way of hard cash, and would
certainly add to the popularity of the issue.

Mick Simmons, Ltd. (Sydney), who sell
tobacco, haircuts, fish-hooks and sporting
goods, and began as a co. four years ago with
£20,677 of the capital represented by good-
will and other hypothetical assets: —

The capital is now £90,000 in £1 shares and
another 10,000 are being offered to present
holders. On the figures there should be no
difficulty in paying the dividend on the
larger total. The harder times ahead will,
no doubt, have some effect on the profit-
earning of the co.; yet this business doesn’t
look so liable to serious disturbance as a
great many others. The past year’s figures
give three cheers to that view: the gross proj
fit on trading was £50,872 as against £47,925
in the preceding 12 months, while operating
exes, were under £lOOO more, and a great
part of that was due to increased income-tax
and bad debts. As to shaky accounts, there
must be a tidy internal reserve, inasmuch as
the practice has been to make an appropria-
tion for a bad debts fund, notwithstanding
that bad debts are charged every year direct
to Profit and Loss. In any case the risks
shouldn’t be tremendous, seeing that most of
the trading is for cash and the book-debts
don’t usually amount to more than about
£20,000. Oii the other side, sundry creditors
stand at £29,857 —apparently all ordinary
trade debts. The co. hasn’t gone in for free-
holds or other large fixed assets; in fact,
more than the total amount of the capital is
represented by stock (£75,960) and fixtures
and plant (£17,477). The co. is thus
enabled to carry on a big business on a
comparatively small capital. Profits are,
therefore, large. On the other hand, no part
of the capital is represented by what are
usually regarded as gilt-edged assets —city
freeholds and the like —though the bulk of
the stock is perhaps really as liquid as a lot
of the things that are generally reckoned
Lou id assets for no better reason than that
they are quoted on the Stock Exchange.
The Australia Hotel Co. (Sydney) :
The net profits during the past four years
have been as follows: —June, 1912. £31.314
(including special profits, probably contin-
gency funds not required for the purposes
for which they were provided) ; i 913,
£24,237; 1914, £22,741; 1915, £21,042. For
the past year the co. pays 6 p.c. on its
pref. shares and 2s. 6d. on its ordinaries,
together £14,480; so there is a very com-
fortable margin of £6562, notwithstanding
Drought and William of Germany. Besides
the profits shown above, considerable addi-
tions have been made to various reserves.
Thus during the past year £2OOO has fallen
into the machinery renewal account. On
the other hand, a trifle has been cut out of
the special repairs fund, presumably to assist
revenue in paying for alterations which have
been made during the year. The reserves,
after paying the half-year’s dividend (3 p.c.
on prefs. and Is. 6d. per share on ordin-
aries) will amount to £44,980, as against
£37,124 twelve months ago. That is an
increase of £7562. Whether the true profits
have been £7862 in excess of the dividends
depends upon whether the depreciation of
the assets has been provided for during the
year by repairs, renewals, extensions, im-
provements, etc., paid for out of revenue.
It is plain, on a review of the past few
years’ operations, that large amounts of
revenue have been put into the premises and
written off. It seems highly probable that
these more than counterbalance the actual
wear and tear. The financial position is
easy. The co., which a few years ago was
heavily in debt, has by issuing a little fresh
capital and by accumulating a good deal of
profit, reduced its liabilities 'on all accounts
to £22,509; while assets apart from
premises, furniture and machinery totalled
£16,271 on June 30.
A scheme has practically been decided
upon to reconstruct this co. The premises
and equipment cost about £300,000. The
greater part of this money was raised in
England, where all but a few of the shares
were held by an investment concern. The
premises carried a very heavy mortgage
debt, and this proved so onerous in bad
times that the share capital was written
down to £25,000. That meant, of course,
also writing down the book value of the
premises. In consequence the building,
including considerable freehold additions
made in recent years, stands now at only
£147,715, or much less than half of the
cost. An Australian group, believing that
the co. could be run to much better advan-
tage, a few years ago bought out the hold-
ing of the English co., paying 40s. per 20s.
share, or thereabouts ; and at the same time,
to reduce the mortgage debt and the interest
burden, £33,000 of cum. pref. capital was
got in. It is doubtful whether the value
that was written off. the premises can be
written back; anyhow, in order to make
the capital more nearly approximate the
true value of the assets, it has been judged
best to reconstruct, forming a new co. with
of £300,000 in £1 shares, of which
150,000 will be issued to holders of ordinary
shares (three for every two). The prefs.
will get their old £33,000; and there will
be 100,000 ordinaries and 17,000 prefs. in
reserve.

For a few years, at any rate, a shipping co.’s
accounts are almost as easy to manipulate
as a State Government’s. Now, that remark
really isn’t as nasty as it sounds. A balance-
sheet and profit and loss account are usually
only an estimate; and you can manipulate
things by making your estimates liberal or
otherwise. For instance, here’s a ship which
has been bumping about for 12 months.
What ought you to write off for deprecia-
tion? One man will say £4OOO. Another
man will say, “Oh, this ship is worth more
than it was 12 months ago. I couldn’t re-
place it now for half as much again as it
cost, and it can earn twice as much as it did
a couple of years back. Nothing at all,
therefore, should be written off.” If that
plan were followed the profits would show
up £4OOO more than they would in the other
case. Given precisely the same books to
prepare his balance-sheet from, one man may
thus show the profits to be thousands of
pounds more than another who takes a
gloomier view of tilings.
In connection with a shipping co. you
usually don’t know how much profit is struck
off against wear and tear: that is to say,
how much is put by to provide for replace-
ments, etc. The profit is only shown after
making provision for depreciation, among
other things. In the table on the top of
these remarks the profits are shown plus
the additions to the insurance accounts and
the boiler and repairs fund, or minus the
amounts withdrawn from those funds. Dur-
ing the past year the withdrawals have been
fairly heavy. Assuming that what the man-
agement calls the net profit shows fairly the
result of the year’s trading, this is how
things have gone : —-
1906 .. .. £7,209 I 1911 .. ..£11,696
1907 . . . . 9,057 | 1912 . . . . 11,627

1.910 . . . . 11,252 I 1915 . . . . 11,203
That the profits shown in the first table
are very much greater for (say) 1911 and
very much less .for the past year is due to
the fact that no calls worth mentioning were
made on the insurance and special repairs
funds in the former year, while last year
saw a heavy drain. If the “net profit” is
what the management says it is, it is plainly
not large enough to justify the 7 p.c. divi-
dend. The only warrant for such a dividend
would be that some of the revenue trans-
ferred to the insurance funds is really
surplus profit.
The next table, frankly, doesn’t throw
much light on the murk :

There is no sign here of hidden affluence.
When a co. is soaking up profit you can
generally find it at some time or other
among the miscellaneous assets, where it is
being saved up to pay for new ships or some-
thing of that kind. This co. doesn't appear
to have ever had much trouble to hide profit
which it didn’t want the public to see.

The co.’s dull, drab past wouldn’t make the
fortune of any dramatist. The concern was
formed away back in 1890, and its title to
the theatre is only leasehold. Therefore it
ought to have been all these years accumu-
lating a fund for the return of capital. It
has not only not done that, but it hasn’t
even always paid a poor little 24 . p.c. divi-
dend. Of late things have certainly been
better. Look at it this way:—

Liquid assets.. ..£1,211 £337 £5Oll
Liabilities .. .. 10,931 606 248
Excess liabilities .. £9,720 £269
Surplus assets .. £4763
During the first of these five-year periods
there was a stoppage of divs.: hence the
quicker improvement then in the cash posi-
tion. The co. has its premises let until
1928, and in a couple of years, besides being
free of expenses for repairs, its revenue will
be larger. There seems a fair chance during
that period not only of a trifle better divi-
dend. but of a good accumulation of cash
towards the return of the £48,000 of capital.

“Owing to increased taxation and other
causes,” the net profit is less. Well, there’s
going to be a lot more taxation yet. We
are not paying the bill at present; but we
shall have to start pretty soon —not merely
the bill for the actual war, which we are
staving off with short loans, but the bill for
pensions and a lot of other new items. If
the extra taxation that has arrived has made
the profits for the half-year look so sick,
they are going to be made to look a lot sicker
by "what has yet to arrive. As a matter of
fact, taxation is something that the Tory
brand of capitalist loves to fling a brick at,
and it consequently has to put up with a lot
of undeserved blame. In this instance the
revenue was only £3587, as against £3712
12 months ago, so that income shrank £125,
while exes, were only £lO3 greater. In-
creased taxation was therefore not the
principal factor. The co.’s capital is
£30,000, and there is £20.000 owing on
debentures. On the other side the
co. has buildings down at £69,000, but
worth more, and £5071 net of liquid
assets before paying the current div.
The return is not glittering and isn’t likely
to be; but the security is as good as anybody
could want.

This co. has bee*n formed on the old-
fashioned and utterly bad plan of permit-
ting shareholders to withdraw their capital.
The Adelaide Co-operative Society works
under the same system. The S. Australian
law, instead of encouraging this method of
finance, ought to suppress it as a public
danger. Here is a co. formed primarily to
handle the surplus fruit stocks of S. Aus-
tralian growers—that is to say, stocks which
can’t be disposed of to be eaten fresh. That
meant putting up a factory to make jams,
jellies, preserves and sauces, and to can
fruit. Of the present capital of £14,255 a
little more than one-half is in the fixed assets
that were thus called for; the balance, to-
gether with £3705 of the bank’s money, is in
stock. The shareholder hands his money
over to a concern to put it into pots and
pans, and then the law permits him to de-
mand it back, not in the shape of a pot or a
pan or half-a-hundredweight of fruit-pulp,
but in hard cash. It ought to be impos-
sible for shareholders to handicap a manage-
ment and imperil the investment of other
shareholders by making such a demand. If
any investor at any time is dissatisfied let
him by all means sell. But let the selling
be his concern —not the co.’s.
The co. also offered forthwith 5 p.c. “in-
terest” or dividend. Fortunately the S. Aus-
tralian fruit-grower is, on the whole, a very
intelligent citizen, and he was persuaded to
allow his “interest” to remain in the busi-
ness. But for that forbearance this provi-
sion might have seriously handicapped the
co. However, though a very large amount of
preliminary work must have been done in
finding customers (for the co. deals direct
with storekeepers), the position is now
reasonably satisfactory. Profits have been
accumulated in excess of the preliminary
exes, which still disfigure the balance-sheet;
so that, as shown above, the whole of the
capital is represented by tangible assets,
with £2S6 over. Seeing that the 5 p.c. div.
has been paid throughout, and that a mod-
erate amount has been written off against
depreciation, the record must be regarded as
very gratifying indeed. In fact, with proper
management and thorough loyalty, every co-
operative concern must be satisfactory. In
this case a combination of fruit-growers
and storekeepers, if both lots are loyal to
their joint concern, can put in their own
pockets the profits which usually go to the
rapacious middlemen, and can cut out as
well the expense of canvassers and collectors,
etc., and that is more money in their pockets.
It is an excellent scheme, and this co. is
going to be a big thing if S. Australia has
its usual good sense.

While this co.’s accounts were on their way
to The Bulletin office N.S.W. farmers—-
wheat men mostly—were in conference con-
sidering whether it was worth while forming
a co-operative co.; and apparently they
couldn’t make up their minds about it. It
may be doubted whether men who can’t make
up their minds about a thing like that really
have any minds to make up. A cocky in the
country wants a thousand wheat bags. That’s
about a ton. He finds that he could get
2100 carried for the same freight that lie
pays for his 1000. Same with wire, manure
and a dozen other things. Cocky wastes tens
of thousands of pounds every year in freight
alone because he doesn’t co-operate with his
neighbor, and throws away tens of thousands
more that he could save in discounts and
allowances if he co-operated to buy in quan-
tities. The cow-farmers were not so much
concerned about buying as about selling.
They had large slices bitten out of them
when their little bits of butter dropped on
to the market. In January, 1900, the
society started with a capital of £l3O sub-
scribed by seven farmers. They wanted to
reach the storekeepers direct. Whether the
experiment lias been a success can best be
judged by the fact that the turn-over in the
past 12 months has been £1,817,588. This is
more than twice as much as the turnover six
years ago, when the co. had been running-
nine years. The longer it lives the more
it is appreciated. Not the least remarkable
thing about it all is that a business of this
size is possible on a paid capital of only
£26,749, with practically no debts beyond
amounts owing to consignors for the last
fortnight’s supplies. This would not, of
course, be possible but for (1) the co.’s
strict rule relating to weekly or fortnightly
payments from its Jmying customers and
(2) the fact that a trifle more than £5OOO
covers the whole of the capital outlay on
plant, including office fittings, etc.
In view of what co-operation has done for
the dairy-farmer The Bulletin has often
urged this co. to take fruit and vegetables in
hand: and a start has now been made.
Already 235 shareholders have come into this
section, paying up for about 10 shares each.
A branch has been established at Ygnco irri-
gation settlement, among other places. So
far, consignments are only disposed of at the
markets, or through the co.’s country agen-
cies. It doesn’t bring the grower and con-
sumer as close together as it is to be hoped
they will come presently; but it is a begin-
ning, and there is no visible reason why
there shouldn’t be as great a growth as the
butter section has achieved. There is room,
a ny way.

Twenty years ago Murray, wlio for the best part or
his life had been an executive officer of the Bank ot
New Zealand, was a director of the institution, and
shouldered the job of holding the moribund affair
up. The mess was awful to contemplate; and when
things got desperate Murray dropped the dreadful par-
ticulars in his bag, caught the next steamer for
Sydney, and leaned for support on a banking fnend
who was wise in strategy. When Murray had un-
folded the story his friend asked weakly for stimu-
lants. Later on, they hammered out a scheme after
consulting George Reid, it is said. Anyway, Murray
boarded the return boat for Wellington, went straight
up to Seddon's office, and, closing the door behind
him, briefly announced that unless Richard produced
a million on the spot the Bank of New Zealand would
close next day. When the staggered Dictator grasped
the meaning of the threatened calamity, and real-
ised the significance of the responsibility Murray was
dexterously shifting on to the Government, he sprang
from his chair like a wounded elephant. “Where
can we get a million?” he bellowed. John Murray
knew (that was one of the things he had found out
in Sydney), and told him. Seddon whistled up Ward,
and in an hour or two there was thrown into Parlia-
ment the Bank of New Zealand Guarantee Bill- a
bomb which nearly blew the roof off. It was an
amazing transaction in many ways, and some of its
attendant happenings are still talked of in whispers;
but the bank stood up, and in a few years became a
goldmine, yielding rich returns to many industrious
souls. When the storm subsided John Murray took a
change of air. He was 80 when he struck the final
balance. A son of his, Donald, once a pressman in
Maoriland, now of America, is the inventor of the
famous multiplex telegraph-printing instrument.

An attempt is being made to put a group
of old Gulgong (N.S.W.) properties on the
Sydney market, in a co. of 125,000 6s. shares,
50,000 of which go to the owners, vendors
and promoters. That bite in paid-up shares
would be quite big enough, seeing that
apparently no work to speak of has been
done by the people who are now approaching
the public. But not content with two-fifths
of the shares, the vendors, etc., ask £5OOO
in cash; and “the expenses in connection
with flotation reports, all legal expenses and
brokerage” will be paid by the co. If this
were an abandoned field on to which some
new people had stumbled, and into which
they had put capital resulting in the develop-
ment of something new and glittering, the
promoters might be justified in asking such
terms. But, as before remarked, there is
no sign that they have spent anything worth
mention. The only report is by one of the
people who also figures as a director, and
the best he can say of the deepest shaft
(225 ft.) is that “this has water up to the 80ft.
level, so I could not examine the workings,
which are said to be all in gold ore... .Rich
gold is said to have been obtained from
each level driven from this shaft, right to
the bottom, which is said to be _ in solid
quartz with good gold values.” Incidentally,
the cost of breaking ore is put down at 2s.
6d. per ton. Mount Lyell’s costs are
probably the lowest in Australia, and min-
ing costs there are 9s. sd. per ton. Still, the
show may be well worth investigating. But
promoters who ask two-fifths of the shares
and £5OOO of the cash without even going to
the expense of unwatering the mine—so that
the examiner has to go on vague rumor as to
all that there is below 80ft. —place a lot of
faith in the confidence of the public.

Shareholders in Vegetable Creek tin
(N.S.W.) expected a bumper profit because
black tin sold durinv the 12 months at an
average of £lO3 ss. per ton. The output of
•154 i tons was worth £15,052; but after pro-
viding for royalty and depreciation the net
profit was only £3060, which is less than
£2O per ton of black tin. The debt has been
whittled down to £8732; and it is partly
owing to royalty payments (which go in re-
duction of the capital debt) that the net
profit is so small. The present arrangement
is that dividends can be paid out of earnings
if the debt to the ground landlord is re-
duced by an equal amount. This means that
the first £BOOO in dividends will require a
net profit of £16,000. Reserves of black-
tin are reckoned at 550 tons, worth £55,000;
but it is quite possible the value may be
£66,000 or £44,000 or £33,000. Deduct the
debt of £8732 from £55,000, and the value of
reserves is £46,268. The net profit has re-
cently been 20 p.c. of the gross earnings,
but the market is optimistic enough to expect
50 p.c.

Bodangora (N.S.W.) sees that, as things
are, dividends must be a long time coming,
so the Board proposes to increase the capa-
city of mine and mill to 1000 tons per month ;
and, of course, that means money.

The Golden Horseshoe, formerly Mt. Gos-
san, Oberon (N.S.W.), has struck what ap-
pears to be profitable ore. A sample said to
have been fairly taken over- a width of
several feet assayed over the ounce. The his-
tory of Mt. Gossan is not encouraging,' but
the present workings, though only about
90ft. deep, are developing what is apparently
a cross reef to that on which most energy and
capital were expended previously. Anyway,
the fact that the mine was a failure where
tried is no proof that it is no good every-
where else. The new development will, at
any rate, receive a practical test, as the
Victorian crowd which owns it is about to
erect a 10-head battery and put through
a crushing, while cyaniding will probably
also be experimented with on a working
scale. Amalgamation alone will not suffice,
as in previous operations 4dwt. or sdwt. got
past the plates. # #
Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado (Vic.), has got
to its fourth clean-up, the tally to date
being:—
Cubic yds. Gold, oz. Tin oxide, tons.
70,000 271 4
125,000 680 8
120,000 374 3
70,000 1550 25
So far, each cleaning-up has been partial.
That is, the first three represented gold and
tin from the two upper floors. No. 4 counts
in a proportion of the bottom of the pad-
dock, though the scraping-up is not com-
plete. On the bottom possibly a fifth was in
ground worked by the old McEvoy mine, once
fathered by Curie ana Hal Sheppard ; and in
this portion, instead of drift, timber was the
residue —a fact to be remembered when
thinking over results. Also, it has to be
recollected that, till the next paddock is
swept up, there will not be a fair quantity
of bottom in proportion to upper drifts. Ex-
penses, estimated at the start at over 8d„
have got down to about 7d., but it won’t be
fair to cast up averages till Moline has had
a fair go at the bottom. Allowing a trifle
over 7d. the last 70,000yds. cost £2lOO, and
the product was worth about £B5OO.
* * * *
Low dieting at Frenchman’s Reef, Dayles-
ford (Vic.), ends as usual. With the shaft
down far enough to allow the mine to be
opened at No. 7 and No. 8 levels, the direc-
tors bucked at making a few 3d. calls. They
went foozling about the upper levels, and
prospected a run of stone south of the main
shaft. Miserable was the result, and small
calls had to be made to keep the banking
account in credit. The only hope left is to
crosscut at Nos. 7 and S. A few 3d. doles
would soon settle all questions as to the value
of the reefs at these points, and the gamble
is worth it. What the Board needs is to get
in a good geologist to tell whether the lode
is in the right belt of country. The Mines
Department sent some of its men to unravel
the Cornish group problem, so it should be
equally generous to a conscientious standing
like the Frenchman’s.
* * * *
Toole, of New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.),
is noAV a Chesterfield in letter-writing about
the mine. As his second cast for the Oath-
cart gutter from No. 2 shaft struck a blank
at 44ft., the rods have been laid down until
another position can be taken up) 100 ft.
ahead. On this Toole notifies an expectant
public that the lead has made its turn much
further back than was expected. Is William
flabbergasted? No! Surface bores had
warned him that he had 60ft. to go beyond
the site of No. 2 bore to get deep ground.
But the other 100 ft. of driving means more
calls, for the gentle admission is heard that
very hard ground is in the face, The two
p’s (pumping and prospecting) still de-
scribe affairs off the co.’s other shaft in the
big Langi workings. Water will have to be
squeezed out a good deal more before the
puddlers can move round regularly. As
ounce prospects are forthcoming off Nos. 1
and 2 shoots, sampling is a lot more hopeful
than when Toole did his last literary flourish
over the show.

Bullfinch Prop. (W.A.) treated more ore,
got a better extraction, and knocked 2s. Gd.
a ton off costs for the last financial year;
yet the profit earned (£29,877) was £20,695
less than for the previous 12 months. Lower
grade ore was the cause of the shrinkage, the
yield per ton being 295. sd. as against
545. 7d. Dividends amounted to 11J p.c., and
absorbed £53,566. or £30,760 more than in
the preceding year. The manager’s report
shows that ore reserves have fallen off by
more than one-half in tonnage and several
shillings in value. His latest estimate of
“actual” is 101,402 tons, assaying 275. 6]d.
Compared with 195,582 tons averaging 365.,
and “probable” he now puts at 14.990 tons,
assaying 28s. 7d., compared with 40,200 tons
aver agin" 295. In other words, the mine Is
barely 14 years ahead of the mill.
* * * *
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) last year
treated 245,000 tons, and obtained £262,910
for its labors. Net profit, after writing
off £11,434 development and £2966 deprecia-
tion, is £27,997. There was £64,644 brought
forward; total £92.641. This it is proposed
to hold on to. Ore reserves are given as
595,007 “positive” tons, valued at 245., and
334,784 “probable” tons nominally estimated
at 21s. The report says the war has not in-
terfered with operations, and that recent in-
creases in the cost of supplies have not
affected working costs. A letter-writer in
the London Financial Times wants to
know why the co. isn’t setting aside £35,000
for a 6d. dividend out of the £92,641 it has
in hand ; but there is a big difference
between the “carry forward” and the co.’s
liquid resources. Including £1757 on deposit
in Australia its cash at the date of the last
balance amounted to £17,109, and there were
bills receivable for £3OOO and sundry debtors
for £409, or a total of £20,518. On the other
hand, there were creditors for £11,519 and a
further £2283 was represented by workmen’s
compensation fund and unclaimed dividends,
making the total liability £13,802. The
excess of cash assets over liabilities was
therefore under £7OOO.

Oroya Links (W.A.) announces a credit
balance for the past financial year of £14,41.6
increased bv the “brought forward” to
£32,597. Two 5 p.c. dividends absorbed
£28,750, leaving £3847 as a legacy for the
new year. In the last term 145,130 tons were
treated for £156,668 —an improvement both
in quantity and value compared with the
preceding 12 months. Working costs at
16s. 6d. were, however, 6d. higher, this being
due to increased price of stores, freights, etc.
Developments more than kept pace with the
treatment plant, and in the Brown Hill-
Oroya north block and other sections for
which no estimate of ore reserves was given,
no less than 58,292 tons were mined. The
“actual” reserves are now estimated at
168,660 tons, worth 245. 5d., compared with
146,775 tons valued at 245. 3d. a year ago.
Probable ore is reckoned at 60,000 tons.
Liquid assets at the end of the year
amounted to £53,092.
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) crushed a record
tonnage last year, but the gold output was
nearly 6000 oz. short of the previous year’s
production. Working costs were lower than
before, but for the current year the manager
foreshadows an increase in consequence of
the rise in the price of mining supplies.
Less development was done last year than
for several years past, but the ore reserves
were increased by nearly 12,000, the latest
estimate being 727,043 tons, averaging 8.56
dwt. This on the basis of last year's output
represents about 2-1 years’ supply for the
mills. The year’s revenue from ore treat-
ment amounted to £389,005, and after pay-
ing costs and writing off £37,997 for develop-
ment and £1727 for taxes there is (including
£5BOO brought in) a credit balance of
£34,644. The redemption of debentures again
takes £12,500, leaving £22,144 to carry for-
ward. The year was barren of dividend, the
distribution of 3s. per share declared a month
or two ago being on account of this current
year.
* * * *
Chaffers’ creditors other than preferential
wages-men have held a meeting in Perth and
decided to accept debentures repayable at the
end of three years, with 8 p.c. interest added,
in full settlement of their claims. It now
only remains to get the formal sanction of
the Supreme Court to complete the recon-
struction of the co., in respect of which
£21,250 fresh working capital has been
guaranteed. •

A Govt, geologist has reported on the Mun-
gari find (W.A.), and has arrived at the
following conclusions: (1) That sufficient
work has not been done to allow him to
definitely state what is the nature of the gold
occurrence, and (2) that further prospecting-
should take place to determine this. As
the show is now being puffed for flotation
purposes in the East the public is advised to
consider the effect of the geologist’s verdict.
* * * *
At Charters Towers the mill returns in
June gave £10,909 from 4711 tons; 5170
tons of tailings were cyanided for £5294, and
the smelter returns were £2253 for gold, £7O
for silver and £6l for lead./ The total for
the month was £18,627. For the half-year
the return is £126,627. In 1910 the half-
year’s return was £341,449. Clark’s mine
is doing development work, but hauling 38
tons of battery stone in 14 days is a bit slow
for a co. loaded with 180,000 shares. A
larger output is promised when Clark’s
bottom level from the underlay shaft is con-
nected with the Lady Maria workings. This
will not take long. There should soon be
another crushing, because early in July
there were 108 tons in the paddock. The
New Queen Cross has crushed 38 tons for
an average of over £6 per ton. Bonnie
Dundee has had a favorable development in
No. 2 west level.
* ,* * *
Pernatty (S.A.) has disposed of 13,500
reserve shares at par (10s.). Reserves have
increased, and the report states that “there
are illimitable possibilities of further develop-
ment.” Pernatty isn’t the first to talk like
that. The original leaching plant, before it
closed down, was treating stuff carrying 1.8
p.c. copper. The copper has been consider-
ably leached in the natural way, so patches
of high-grade ore should exist where the con-
ditions for precipitation have been favorable.
“T.IJ.M.”: Lake McDonnell, near Port
Le Hunte (S.A.), was always regarded by
the infrequent local inhabitant as just a
useless hole filled with salted moisture. But
some observations made by a visitor named
Atkinson suggested further inspection by a
syndicate. This revealed that under the
shallow lake is a salt pan of about 3000
acres, white for the top 12 inches and
pinkish below that. The travellers pro-
ceeded to take levels for a tramway to Port
Le Hunte and selected sites for storage
sheds, and unless something breaks down,
Sydney and Melbourne will soon be mixing
some of that lake with their breakfast egg.

Tongkah Compound, the second of the
Malay tin cos. floated in Australia, has now
been going for five years, and on a capital
of £so.ooo—some of it water—dividends of
£133,750 have been paid. The area origi-
nally secured was small but very rich. Sub-
sequently various other slices were acquired,
and on one of these the dredge was engaged
last half-year. It wasn’t as rich as the
original area, nor was the work as straight-
forward : and that and troubles due to the
same old war reduced the profits for the six
months to £B3BO. The total area of ground
thus far acquired is 117 acres, of which 44
have been dredged and 11 are not payable
—unless the tin market soars still higher.
Of the 62 acres available, the greater part
will, it is estimated, go at least lib. to the
yard. Last half-year’s was the poorest crop
so far gathered—l.o9lb. The most prolific
period was the 18 months from October
onwards, when the lowest average for any
term was 2.421 b. and the highest 2.761 b.
At lib. per yard, with tin at present price,
approximately half the proceeds are profit;
and the recovery should be about 180 tons
in the six months. To prolong the life of
the co. beyond the five years which the pre-
sent holding will give (assuming nothing
disastrous happens’ to the tin market 1 the
co. is now boring ground on Fuket Island,
about 17 miles away. It is impossible to
say what profit there is in the ground actu-
ally acquired. With tin concentrates
fetching £lOO a ton —the recent price-
there should be over £BO,OOO. There are
150,000 shares.

A Good Corn
Remover.
Those who suffer from corns and hard skin
on the soles of the feet w'll find it a great
boon to apply a little Atla Resin to the corn,
which, when applied to the corn or hard skin,
and a little covering of cotton wool on the
the top to prevent it sticking to the stocking,
will remove the corn in- a day or two. The
Atla Resin seems to act by getting thor-
oughly into complete contact with the corn,
and thus being able to penetrate it, and not
to act on the surface only. It is certainly
the latest cure for these troublesome and
painful structures, and, according to all re-
ports by those who have used it. one of the

WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, July 10, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
Governor Strickland opened the fete
whose proceeds go towards fitting up Grav-
ihwaite for our wounded. His Ex., with
the eldest treasure and her younger sister, in
white cloth costumes, voyaged from Rose
Bay in veteran Tom Dibbs’s yacht. The
party, which was shadowed by Help d’Apice,
had Dugald Thomson and Hanbury Davies
as outposts in the advance up the path that
bads from the water’s-edge to the Yacht
Squadron’s grounds. These, as I told you,
were lent by the club for the occasion. This
unbending was partly due to the fact that
the donor of Graythwaite-—Tom Dibbs—
is Perpetual Admiral or something of the
Squadron. As speeches were about to begin
in the portico, Mrs. Wesclie, who is on the
Bed Cross, bustled along and took her place
on the threshold. This done, the company
preened its feathers and observed that Mayor
Richards and Dugald Thomson were just
visible behind large areas of gilded gum-leaf,
variegated ribbon and colored buttons. These
decorations are presumably insignia of Aus-
tralia Day, and were gazed at with starting
eyes by infants in microscopic skirts and ex-
cited hair bows. Alfred Milson, whose
family first sprouted on the Point that bears
their name, offered a few nautical remarks
to put a head on the preceding oratory.
Several yachtsmen lounged as spectators
on the terraced garden with disgusted-]ook-
ing terriers sulking at their heels. They obvi-
ously bore the influx of Woman as some-
ihing to be tolerated but not encouraged.
Others, including yachtsman Trouton, had
been up with the early milk, helping the hon.
organisers—Mrs. John Mackay and Mrs.
Cecil Hordern —to remain calm. Even a
flustered telephone which broke down and
remained dumb at an important crisis in
the preparations failed to upset anything but
a pail or two of yachting language. Early
in the proceedings a jaunty-looking gentle-
man with a flowing moustache (a rare ex-
hibit in these razored days) tripped round
among new arrivals on behalf of the sheep-
waistcoat fund. Mrs. Tom Dibbs, a very
pleased old lady, looked up with proper
pride at her six-foot-odd of husband as he
briefly replied to the compliments of those
present. Lower down, where the water
lapped the shore, a diver’s bubbles could be
plainly seen. So could the diver, who
splashed about in six feet or so of harbor.
Trips to Fort Denison were the most popu-
lar event of the afternoon. A yachtsman
who devoted his priceless time to handing
out the female tourist on to this crag, got
even the heavyweights ashore without losing
so much as a peggy-bag.
The Chief Justice Cullens are spending
the winter vacation on the Darling Downs,
cot very far from Steele Rudd’s farm beyond
Toowoomba.
General Finn’s only son had been gazetted
lieutenant in a British garrison artillery
regiment when he wrote to father the other
day. A garrison artillery sounds like some-
thing that has the dull task of sitting behind
big guns on their native shore. But in this
case it is a new and tremendous force that
is going to Flanders —or has already gone.
The censpr wouldn’t let me tell you any more
about this ordnance. Besides, I don’t know
much more. Young Finn threw up a rosy
engineering billet in Spain to train in the
gunnery service.
There’s a mention of Melba going on to
Canada to stay with the Connaughts after
her U.S. tour. In this event our old friend
ex-Chamberlain Dick Nevill will probably
be waiting on the front step to hand the
Voice out of her chariot. Government House,
Ottawa, has a still, barraeky-looking ex-
terior, and is fringed with hard-featured
pines. But Nevill, who is Controller of the
household, knows how to run even a frozen
vice-regal establishment on velvet tyres.
Lieut.-Colonel Gilbert Elliott, recently
wounded, was one of our loan officers from
Britain. In 1913 he Avas on the Australian
instructional staff, attached to the Engin-
eers.
Crawford Greene, a son of the late George
Greene, of landra, is noAV clanking at the
Front in the Ist Life Guards.
The Ronald Notts, of Sydney, were going
to Paris a feAV Aveeks ago, after camping at
one of London’s huge menageries AA r here you
throw tips to performing waiters.
The profits from the Prince of Wales
birthday concert to help our boys in splints
.come to £1167. Hon. manager .1. BroAvnlow
is collecting a sheaf of gratitude—and some
incidental Avrinkles.
Tin* news that Adrian Knox, K.C., is
going to Egypt to organise the distribution
or Red Cross relief is good reading to con-
tributors. Good value and no overlapping
of, even a pair of socks are what they
desire; and no man in Sydney is better
qualified than this leader of the Bar to see
that they get it., lie accepts no payment
foj his services, and declines to dip into the
funds for even out-of-pocket expenses.
Sydney artists have contrived an Aus-
tralia Day medal. It shows the lean Australian
in wait for. the Fez on the slopes of Galli-
poli. The limitations of a medal permit of
the display of only stretcher-bearers and a
few warships as the Kangaroo’s background.
The rising sun occupies the reverse of the
little shield. It makes an island entirely
surrounded by the glory of the word “Dar-
danelles —1915.” John Lane Mullins, of
Challis House, or Oxnard Smith, hon. sec.
of the Royal Art Society, will gladly take
your orders for originals. Medals are in
gold, silver and a brass alloy at £2, 10s. and
2s. Gd. apiece. J. C. Wright, the young
Scotch sculptor with the picturesque ex-
terior, is responsible for the design.
Last week’s meeting at St. Vincent's Hos-
pital overflowed the premises, and -had to be
led to the wide back verandahs by John
Lane Mullins. As a perpetual peri (I sup-
pose all pen's are not ladies 1 at the portal
of Good Works, the artistic John read aloud
the objects. These were to get funds to
immediately equip 100 beds which the Sis-
ters offer for cases from Gallipoli. Roughly,
about £lO (less a farthing or so) will fit-out
the bed with everything it needs, from a
pillow to a toothbrush. Offers of help fell
like the blessed dew from Heaven upon the
peri’s head.
At the Kosciusko snow frolics Noel Mcln-
tosh won the novice ski race—a form of
entertainment that usually gives great joy to
the spectators. Miss Nivison was ahead in
the ladies’ ditto. Mr. Richmond, Mr. Rig-
ney, Dr. F. McCarthy and Molly Ruse were
amongst those who “also ran.”
The first batch of wounded soldiers who
arrived unexpectedly by train from Mel-
bourne on Sunday morning may thank their
luck that comparatively few people did
rush the station. In spite of Chief Sec-
retary Black’s wrath and the reproaches of
other people, it is possible that the weary
men didn’t feel equal to meeting half the
population. If the public must demonstrate
—-well, aren’t we going to have Australia
Day?
Louise Mack, in a black frock that had
been generously slashed at the top end to
show a plump neck and dimpled arms, gave
us her personal impressions of “the wash
of Prussian blue” as she saw it in Belgium.
The Repertory Theatre, though not large,
was still over-large for the voice the attrac-
tive Louise first flung over the front stalls.
An encouraging male unit in the twilight
background urged the lecturess to “Kindly
speak up”—which she did. She has a good
story to tell, though on the opening night she
was really too nervous to tell it all. She
fancied somebody was fidgeting, and so she
galloped to a sudden conclusion. After that
first flight she knows better than to knock
out any of the thrilling story of her experi-
ences in Antwerp. The less exciting experi-
ences of war-travel will be deleted, if there
is need to delete anything at all.
Bridge enthusiasts can help the cause and
still go ahead at their pet form of brain-
fag. The Albert Gould family and Mar-
jory Mort the other day navigated an effort
of this kind —cash strictly in advance. The
Fresh Food and Ice Co., which furnished the
rooms, disdained to touch a copper of the
proceeds.
Last mail brought Mrs. Charvin (Yvonne
Leverrier) an unexpected gift from the
French Red Cross Society. It came to the
brilliant pianiste in a neat leather case —a
shield-shaped brooch with the Allies’ flags
surrounding a Red Cross in the centre.
After recovering from the shock Yvonne
read the letter. Briefly, it conveyed, in
elegant French, the gratitude of the Society
to the Frencli-Australian woman who had
organised the big entertainment for the Red
Cross of her father’s land. The executive
committee sent, in addition, the diploma
from the Central Council. Now, grateful
in her turn to the country which furnished
the money, the pianiste has in hand a Town
Hall concert in aid of the Australian
wounded. It is listed for October 9.
One day last week, when the sun played
behind some very wet showers, Miss Hope
Betts said “I will” to her bank-manager
Marshall. The bride belongs to the
Hunter’s Hill clan which comes, on the dis-
taff side, from parson Marsden, of very early
Sydney. The William-street branch of the
Bank of N. S. Wales has been furbished up
for the home-coming of the doves. ,
A Sydney girl, Miss R. Falk, is waiting
in London to name the wedding day. That
will be when her young man, a naval man
named Thompson, can get a few days’ leave.
He has been on active service somewhere in
the grey North Sea. Mamma Falk and a
sister are on hand to talk over ibe trousseau
with the bride-to-be.
Amy Castles is already sifting out details
for a Red Cross concert she’ll give in Syd-
ney on August 21.
Derek Hudson’s impressive voice, now
rolling out in “The Marriage Market” at
Her Majesty’s, is only a minor event com-
pared with his cowboy breeches. A slice
from these garments would make a fine
waistcoat for Tommy Kangaroo. _ Ethel
Cadman, a recent importation who is not
setting the harbor in flames, fails (in a high
key) to recognise the ex-cowboy in the swal-
low tails of our effete civilisation. No
wonder!
N. S. Wales has been dredging in its
pocket pretty freely during the last 12
months. An analysis shows that, in addi-
tion to the Hospital Saturday and United
Charities Funds and the ordinary, charities,
it has been able to exercise its philanthropy
on six Belgian funds and 27 other war
efforts, ranging in objective from the supply
of motor-ambulances to the gift of cigar-
ettes. Altogether, including the Hospital
and United Charities collections, £1,133,05S
13s. 2d. was subscribed up to a recent date,
just at the beginning of the big bushranging
for Australia Day. A very fair effort, and
the mention of the odd tuppence shows that
N. S. Wales is not only generous—in spots
—but exact.
The Symphony Orchestral Concert held
on Saturday afternoon in the new Conserva-
toriuin Hall bumped into the same date as
the Ivirribilli Red Cross fete. Still there was
a good though not a crowded house; and
Slap., with his cohort well in hand, pro-
duced something exceptionally enjoyable. As
somebody said, Slap, may not be one of the
great musicians of the world. But, at any
rate, he has temperament. And he preserves
a fine balance.
The Sports Carnival on July 24 has gath-
ered in Dolly Fogg, the Tasmanian show-
ring equestrienne—the lady who used to
wear windmill hair-bows —and the up-country
youngster, Myra Smith, as attractions in the
high-jumping events. If the rain which is
hanging around will come down and be done
with it, Australia Day Fund will get a fat
cheque from the Agricultural Ground dis-
play.
Mrs. Hugh Ward’s bazaar at Her
Majesty’s on Australia Day will open at
8 a.m. and continue unclosed till 11 p.m.
No extra charge for overtime. Anything
suitable that you can hand in will be
accepted with applause.
Merchant Norman Shelley’s good-looking
widow lias returned after years of absence
from her native Sydney. She mostly lived
in London, while Norman built up a fortune
in Clarence-street. Mrs. Shelley is the
youngest daughter of the late Professor
Pell, who. besides being a one-time don at
Sydney ’Varsity, did no end of good service
t.i Australia by helping to found the
A.M.I*. Insurance Office. The eldest
daughter of the Pell family is Mrs. Frank
Plomlej—the little lady who sits on all
manner of committees to help lame dogs
over stiles. There are two brothers. They
mostly favor mining fields, and one of them
wrote the first set of articles that a Sydney
paper ever printed about the Broken Hill
silver wonder.
The Rose Bay Convent is in the throes of
preparation for an ex-students’ sale of
almost everything you can think of. July
24 is the fateful day. It’s to help the suf-
ferers from the Front.
Mrs. Herring (you may remember her as
the good-looking Florette Murray-Prior of a
few years back) is staying at Hampstead—
the picturesque hamlet where a biting wind
rushes over the famous ’Eatli, and drops
down dead behind the walled gardens of the
resident gentry. Hubby is either in Egypt
or in business at Gallipoli.
Lieut. Sydney Nelson got a cable from
the Admiralty that his services were re-
quired on the other side. So he left in a
recent P. and O. boat for London. Sailor
Nelson has done a good deal of packing-up
since the war began. He was on the Aus-
tralia with a relief lot of men —never mind
where —and followed that up by a brief
taste of the tropics as Assistant Harbor-
Master at Rabaul. Then he came back to
Sydney aboard the Una (nee A
younger brother is aboard HALS. Glou-
cester, which exchanged shots to some pur-
pose with the enemy’s craft Breslau.
The auction record for things like Belgian
flags has surely been achieved by the Waira-
rapa, in Maoriland. At a concert at Feather-
ston the other night a framed enlargement
of the Trentham Training Camp was put up
to auction, and in about half an hour
brought the astounding sum _of £18,528.
Everyone who bought it put it up again.
Once it realised £3OOO, and purchasers at
£lOOO were quite common. Finally Walter
Buchanan bought it “for keeps” for £lOOO.
and handed it to the local library. It must
be the dearest photo, on record. A few
days before, at Carterton, also in the Waira-
rapa, a Belgian flag was auctioned and real-
ised over £20,000! Great are the wool and
mutton kings when they start.
An exhibition of students’ work in the
It.A. Society’s rooms displays the human
form in all the humps and bumps with
which very young artists credit it. Some
of the nude studies are good ; others are so in-
different that they portray us as hybrid
creatures between the lady camel and the
fatted cow. A few portrait studies are
mere promising material.
Shows to swell the Australia Day fund
are beginning to fall over each other. Ihe
Tom Hughes lady the other day opened one
out-of-the-way affair. The girls of John
Bridge and Co.’s clerical staff had found time
to organise this on their own account and
bring it to a successful climax in St. James s
Hafl.
Souter, Harry Julius and Syd Ure Smith
are mainly responsible for the designs on
some new playing-cards. Proceeds go to our
boys in khaki. George Bex and Mary are
the King and Queen of Hearts. But who s
the Knave? Somebody suggests Germany s
Crown Prince. In that case, let’s hope
nobody will ever play euchre with the pack.
If a recent London photo, of an Australian
musician, Bessie Griffiths, can be relied on,
skirts are worn with a hem live yards round.
They are not worn with any special advan-
tage to the lady who happens to be inside so
much flounced material. Bessie’s frock
which is for evening parties—touches the
ground. It must gather quite a large collec-
tion of healthy microbes if the charlady liasn 1
been extra-energetic. A few brave Sydney
women are still wearing the tailored coats
and skirts of last winter, and giving the dif-
ference to the war funds. With the spring,
however, poor human nature will probably
give way suddenly and flounce outside in
yards and yards of floral goods.
Passers-through this week included Freda
Sternberg, a Melbourne girl who is going
north to get some constant exercise for her
itching pen. She has been freelancing on
the fringe of Society for three or four
years past, and her work has so pleased
the eye of the Melbourne Frank Fox that he
has invited her north to the Brisbane Maie.
John Wren lately bought the paper, and.
flying high, secured the Age leader-writer
and ex-chief-of-staff to run it for him.
In these days of thrilling snacks from the
numerous Fronts, there’s a far-away echo of
peace about a lecture on mural decorations.
Norman Carter it is who tells the aesthetic
the correct way to trim your humpy walls.
If you haven’t got a humpy, you’ll have to
do your best with a nail-driving competition
on the boarding-house wall-paper.
The 51 Maoriland Nightingales who went
in a batch to England had a fortnight in
London to see the sights, and were then ex-
ported for service in Egypt. If you
want to visit the Sphinx it seems a round-
about way to take a Piccadilly taxi; but
when the original arrangements were made
the war gods didn’t know what a demand for
the sisterhood there would be by the Nile.
A cheque for £67 has reached the Mos-
man committee of the Bed Cross as the
result of the recent loan-picture exhibition
organised by Mrs. Hugh Wright.
Herbert Batclili'e, the local baritone who
was tuning up at the Boyal Academy when
the Prussian Boot began to trample on Bel-
gium, went into camp some months ago. He
is now a proud lootenant in the Boyal Fusi-
liers, and was packing up for service when
the last news came my way.
A weird outbreak of “gollywogs” has fol-
lowed the wake of the Jap warships. Any-
thing from £lO to £3O can be cleared out of
them at any serious patriotic _ effort. A
solemn announcement that this or that
society would withdraw its sale of Aus-
tralia* Day gollywogs would make quite as
much commotion in some suburbs as the
ukase against vodka did in Bussia.
Artist Joe Wolinski is trying his luck in
N’York with a show of brush work. Like
other artists, he is finding that London can
do without an awful lot of luxuries just now.
Dr. Palmer Benbow, the Victorian who
did so much slogging for the Bed Cross in
Servia, is now rather a sick man in London.
He caught the typhus scourge and developed
complications that invalided him back to the
Thames.
Bemember the Earl of Meath, who was
out this way a while back bleating so loudly
of Empire? Now at the age of 74 he has
attained distinction as the oldest volunteer
in Kitchener’s Million. His side-partner is
the family coachman, while his platoon ser-
geant is superintendent of Meath’s local
“workus.” There are four sons and two
-in-laws taking pot-shots at the enemy, so it
is quite a good family record even in these
times.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.
Aurora, only daughter of the second mar-
riage of picturesque old Henry Parkes, was
married the other day to E. J. Evans, of the
X.S.W. official law-reporting staff.

ECZEMA CURED.
Mr. J. Thompson, 3 Onslow Street, Granville, says:
“For a lons time I was tortured with Eczema. The
irritation of this ailment is dreadful, the days are
miserable, and the nights sleepless. I tried all sorts
of remedies>, but nothing did me any good. I con-
sulted a doctor, but his treatment also failed to
benefit me. At last my son induced me to get a
pot of Doan’s Ointment, having heard this remedy
very well spoken of. After the first application 1
noticed an improvement, so I continued the treatment
until I was quite cured, using in all two pots.”
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all chemists and store-
keepers at 2/9 per pot.*

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, July 19, 1915.
.My Dear Yarrie, —
Dolores gave her concert of July 14 in the
cause of the French victims of the war. The
State Governor sat at her feet; also Lady
Stanley, adorable in pink and chinchilla.
1 he new aide—the one with the expressive
eyes—-bought programmes and sweets from
the French girls who were smiling around,
Rod seemed to be bearing up well under the
infliction. The Maddens were there, he in
bis inimitable dress suit, she in her now
famous red plush concert coat. The French
Consul’s black beard positively bristled with
excitement; and at one moment of over-
mastering enthusiasm he rushed forward and
shook hands exuberantly with Bunny Zel-
man. A tribute to the latter’s handling of a
patriotic number.
Dolores wore a regal gown; it was prin-
cess satin hung about with lace threaded in
gold and silver and dripping with pearls.
She wore a collar of diamonds and just one
monster pearl hanging on her dimpled neck.
Lawyer Haydn Stark sold the flags,
which Louise Smith Dwyer held up for
inspection. A big, silken French flag hung
on a gilded pole was the first to go, at
£l5O. Small French flags reached respectable
prices. The Italian flag (Dolores is half
Italian) fetched £lOO. The Austi*alian flag
—a small silk affair —roused the house to a
fury of patriotic emotion, and a gentleman
in the balcony, with money but few h’s, bid
his usual “ ’undred” in a decisive voice. But
the financial guns of Mrs. Michaelis were
too much for him. The good lady had just
received news of the safety of her son, and
she wAs in a mood to pay any old sum for
anything. The auctioneer had a manner
entirely his own—a dignified stroll back
and forth with the flags held aloft and his
capacious white waistcoat pushed well for-
ward. His quiet demeanor was a change
from the feverish Niblo pose, and he got the
money just the same. The emblems brought
in £507, and then there was the door money.
It was understood that Dolores sang “The
Minstrel Boy” as a “special request” item.
In which case I think I can name the?
special-requestor in one try. Archbishop
Carr , had a seat in the vice-regal reserve,
and if his good old Grace seemed to love
one Dolores song more than another it was
“The Minstrel Boy.” Next day’s mail
brought the songstress a note of thanks from
the Archbishop, with a cheque for £2O for
the cause.
All things considered, the absence of the
G.-G. and Lady Helen from that concert was
not more remarkable than the fact that that
was the evening they were putting in at
Lilydale, with Melba as hostess. De Bour-
guignon’s pianoforte recital, which Melba
had been selling tickets for, happened on the
same night as the Dolores event. Coinci-
dences will occur.
France’s “Glorious Fourteenth” was a
day. The street collection figures are under-
stood to be absolutely alarming. There was
something novel and tricky in the badges
sold —instead of a one-pattern button to
spot patriots like a rash, there were little
metal field-guns, British Dreadnoughts,
khaki helmets and gilt and pearl swords in
miniature.
The most remarkable thing about the
pageant was the marching capacity dis-
played by our Best Girls. Delicious French
peasants they looked in the shortest skirts
and the starchiest muslin; and some of them
walked twice round the city in real wooden
sabots without a murmur.
The Fergusons stayed with Melba at
Coombe Cottage on Wednesday night of last
week for the Belgian de Bourguignon’s
Lilydale concert. Melba had been selling
tickets for the young man, and there was a
bumper house, but the natives stamped with
rage when they found that their idol was
not to sing.
The Fergusons have their troubles like
the humblest of us. The other day, when
tea arrived for a Red Cross Sewing Bee,
Lady Helen announced that the milk-oh was
late. Having no next-door neighbors to
borrow from . she had to serve the beverage
Chinese fashion. Such are the tragedies
that fall from the blue upon those in high
places!
Lady Stanley gave a tea-party last Thurs-
day at Stonington. Just a friendly little
feed with nothing of an Imperial nature at
the back of it. The drawing-room looked
homely and peaceful. A big log-fire burnt
iin the grate, and the Governor was on hand
with his. most sociable manner and a seduc-
tive. waist to his coat. Lady Stanley in
flaring black taffetas wore a comfy little gar-
den hat made of fur and frills and flowers,
and tied under her very pretty chin. She
also had the children in to tea. There was
every inducement to make the guests talk
in a domestic fashion about their babies and
their gardens and their servant worries. The
thoughtful hostess even had a huge copper
tray heaped up with kitchen-garden pro-
dvice ; Turks’ caps and pumpkins and other
fine colored gourds out of her own back gar-
den. But all in vain! Our women have
become incorrigibly patriotic. They have
war on the brain. They can discuss nothing-
hut the Way to Help. On this occasion
they would talk about Buttons. They col-
lected in knots with their chins and noses
almost meeting, and hissed button talk at
each other.
Each knot was at fever heat. Most of the
talkers were mayoresses; and mayoresses
can't be women these stirring times—they
can only be heads of suburbs that are eaten
up with rivalry as to results on War Fund
Days. Australia Day is the next venture.
Somebody had restricted the number of
Buttons issued to suburban mayoresses, and
each mayoress was bound to get to the
bottom of the matter or know the reason
why. Eventually they went quite insane and
forgot their host and hostess completely.
Lady _ Stanley was left languidly leaniifg
back in a large armchair with her hat tilted
up off her curls —a pathetically beautiful
outsider in her own home.
Glollywogs are the latest contrivances for
raising money for the wounded. They are
mostly made of old stockings and rejected
knitting-wool, so you see the initial ex-
pense is not excessive. There is a
Gollywog committee and an army of
strenuous workers at Commerce House.
The Mayoress is president, and Melba
and Ada Arniytage are vices. Mrs.
Cyrus Barlow is secretary, and lawyer Max-
well keeps a wary eye on the business side
of the venture. Lady Stanley and Melba
both went to the opening day, and already
the girls have made 20,000 little gollywogs
and 10,000 large ones. By Australia Day
they expect to have at least 100,000, all told.
Everybody—or nearly everybody—came
from everywhere last week to greet Dolores
at the Austral Salon, and the place was full
of warmth, flower scent, powder, tea, talk
and song. Dolores escaped at the end of
the day nearly smothered but happy.
Lady Stanley opened Mrs. Murray’s shop
for the sale of gifts in Collins-street last
•Thursday. The sale was to have been in
the Tourists’ Bureau, but the goods multi-
plied so that they got in the way of the
tourists. _ Finally, Mr. Bamford, Singer’s
manager in Australia, gave over the whole
of the firm’s Collins-street premises to the
cause. _ Now anyone that goes along the
Block is drawn in by the perfume that comes
from the sewing-machine place. Wild flowers
from the volcanic richness of the Grampians
are a special attraction. Mrs. Murray has
flowers from her own garden, too. She her-
self planted at Vermont the wattles where-
from she has picked the branches on sale.
She, by the way, was the first Burnley Hor-
ticultural gardener woman to take a dip-
loma. The window is full of fruit. Girls
are busy making some of it up into preserves.
The shop will stay open as long as the gifts
continue to arrive.
Bamford, of Singer’s, has, by the way,
two sons at the war. One has just fought
his way to a commission.
The Stanleys “patronised” a Malvern
ball for children on Friday—the same being
in aid of the Red and Purple Crosses. There
were so many children at three shillings a
head that the party overflowed into the'
larger St. Kilda Town Hall. Lady Stanley
could not go herself, but she sent her chil-
dren, and John _ Madden was on hand with
liis hair spread in three beautiful peaks, and
lus handsome wife accompanied him, as she
mostly does, and the three Miss Mont-
gomerys, who got the affair up, looked lovely
in black, and swirled about with posies of
violets and chiffon streamers, and countless
Malvern mothers hung proudly over the bal-
conies as their darlings gyrated and fluffed
and clucked like anxious chooks, and—but
let’s have a fresh sentence.
Sir Arthur Stanley’s father is looking
after a couple of wounded Victorians at his
country house in Cheshire. The names are
not available, but the young men declare
that they have “marched past” our Governor
several times, so it is possible to guess who
they are within five or six thousand.
Lady Stanley’s small daughter Pamela
has the large eyes and saintly look of a
Burne Jones knight. Like the medimval
warrior, she wears her straight, fair hair cut
in a basin crop. Miss Edwell, the miniature
painter, is busy painting the child.
The Overseas Club’s contribution to the
Irench National Day was a Cafe Chantant.
with an excitable concert and a continuous
auction among the tea tables. The business
went on all day and most of the night. Mrs.
Godfrey and Mrs. Fitzpatrick ventured out
at lunch-time to an opposition cafg, and
there sold badges and flowers at fabulous
prices. Mrs. James, the secretary, worked
like a nigger, yet looked cool in white cloth.
At the afternoon tea party Mrs. Pearce, the
Defence Minister’s wife, and Mrs. Alfred
Deakin, had special guest tables. The
Mayor was a visitor—and oh, the resplen-
dency of his high hat! All the Consuls and
Trade Commissioners were there too.
From my Adelaide correspondent: —
Mrs. Culross and two of her daughters, Mrs. Hoy
Burston and Miss Culross, are booked for England
at the end of July. The third daughter, who is
already there, was engaged to young Teesdale Smith,
the news of whose death at the Dardanelles came
through some weeks ago. Mrs. Burston’s doctor-
husband is also on his way to the Front.
Amongst the passengers by the Mongolia were Roy
Marten and Walter Law Smith. They are both off to
the war.
John Downer, Mr. Addison and Mr. Ivlauer are
all on sick leave from the Leg. Council. Inciden-
tally, Parliament has been opened with about the
longest Governor’s speech on record, and with many
protestations of brotherly love. The debates, how-
ever, show as much party acidity as ever.
The Hunt Club met at Salisbury on Saturday
and plodded over wet paddocks and heavy, ploughed
fields. The Willie Popes, the Arthur Waterhouses,
the George Bagots, Mrs. R. Colley and the Fred
Porters were amongst those who fallowed by road.
But hunting is pretty dead this year.
The new Bishop—Dr. Gilbert White, of Willochra
—arrived by Tuesday's express, and will stay at
Bishopscourt till he goes to Port Pirie for his
enthronement. But Petersburg will be the head-
quarters of his new bishopric, at least till the
end of the year. His sister, Miss White, is with
him.
The Port Augusta Ostrich Farm has been sold
and its inmates transported to Willunga, about
30 miles south of Adelaide. The vast sad birds
were carried to their new home in a special train
of about 15 vans.
A “Follow the King” meeting was held in the
Exhibition Building on Thursday, with Mr. Chappel
in the chair, and the Premier, Mr. Pascoe, Professor
Naylor and the übiquitous Henry Howard as the
chief speakers. According to Premier Vaughan the
State’s yearly drink bill is about one and a half
million, and the Professorial speaker added a word
about the advisability of wiping out racing as well
as intoxicants for the duration of the war.
On the same afternoon the Victoria League held
its annual meeting, with Lady Galway—who is the
League’s President —in the chair. Mrs. Russell
Booth, who has done excellent work for the League
as secretary, has resigned, and her place has been
taken by Mrs. Howard Davenport.
The Earl of St. Germans, who had been engaged as
Help, but may not come this way, after all, is only
25, rather good to look upon, and unattached (or
was a month ago —there’s no saying these days).
Incidentally, he pays taxes in Cornwall and Glouces-
tershire, and his commission in the Scots Greys en-
titles him to one star on each coat cuff. The principal
accomplishment of the belted youth is a gift of
mimicry, and his audiences in the Flemish trenches
(whence he has just been returned as damaged
goods) were real sorry he had to go. At latest, there
was a hope that he was getting well enough to come
back again.
Arthur Payne, son of the late T. B.
Payne, the long-lived moneybags -who owned
nearly half of South Yarra, with sheep-pas-
ture and mining-land in other parts of Aus-
tralia, is preparing to leave for England, to
offer his services and part of his fortune for
war purposes. Payne owns Scotsburn, in
the loveliest quarter of Toorak —a solid
dwelling once the home of the late James
Mcßain. The departing plutocrat is a
quiet, worthy, rural-producing person who
does not advertise.
Franz Wallacb, the lately-interned direc-
tor of the Australian Metal Co., had been
receiving attention from the Defence autho-
rities for a long time. Some months ago a
cordon surrounded Wallaces house at Koo-
yong while its owner was preparing to at-
tack his morning newspaper, and caused
the loyal fellow tremendous annoyance.
Even his Akgtts was arrested on the door-
mat. Wallach’s dwelling, when he is not
at Langwarrin, is a pretentious plastered
building, a cross between a Rhine-eastle and
a city-hall, on the south slope of the Koo-
yongkoot valley, back of Toorak. Wallac-h
is a bird of the young-old breed, much given
to preening himself amongst the girls.
Mary Whiteside, the “frightfully pretty”
(I quote the other kittens) daughter of the
well-known Beaconsfield cleric, is engaged
to George Mitchell. She is but 18. lie is
a successful farmer and the son of a sea-
captain. Despite all of which he intends to
enlist.
Mrs. (Dr.) Ewing has volunteered—as
chauffeur of a St. John ambulance vehicle.
She is one of our least adventurous drivers,
being able to steer a car through a crowded
thoroughfare, often without knocking down
so much as a baby.
Fritz Hart, the intense little J.C.W.
conductor with the burning manner and the
riotous head of hair, has finally and forever
established the fact that he is not of Ger-
man origin. He gave the press a resume
of his family tree the other day, and there
is not a dron of lager on a leaf of it. A
great-great-grandfather Avas a British ad-
miral, and other ancestors were 'equally dis-
tinguished and not one of them ’ ever said
“Prosit” in his life. Half a dozen quite
recent episodes have inspired me with the
notion of hiring someone to say that my
real name is Johann, and that I was born
in Stuttgart. I will then arise angrily and
point out in the papers that on one side
of the family I am a Montmorency, and on
the other a Colonna; that the founder of
the line was a relative of Sliakspeare, Bacon
and Lord Burleigh, and that we
married freelv with the Churchills, Bunyans.
Percys and Byrons. I don’t knoiv a better
way of putting before the world the fact
that one is of noble and intellectual desce- L
Audrey Chirnside has been touring N. S.
Wales with a suite which included a team
o p greyhounds, a couple of motor-cars, a
maid or two, chauffeurs, hot-water bags and
father. Audrey, who should have been
christened Diana, entered some of her dogs
at Rooty Hill without any luck, but picked
up a few prizes at Corowa and other cours-
ing centres.
Dave Lilley, of Hawthorn, has gathered
up the loose ends of his assaying
business, tied them neatly together, safe-
deposited the whole concern, and is now a
pupil ah the Seymour school-of-instruction,
learning how to be an officer. Lilley has
long been affectionately regarded by Miss
Hawthorn as one of her loveliest lads. He
inherited a patrician profile from his
mother, one of the McMurtrie girls, who in
another generation made marks on the
social calendar.
Mrs. Leibner had a tea-party at Cliveden
Mansions last week, to celebrate her son's
engagement to Carina Butcher. In defer-
ence to the gloom of the times the hostess
'curtailed the guest list and the magnificence
of the decorations. In addition to the
conventional ration of bun, each feminine
guest was awarded a blue-bird brooch and a
uunch of violets.
Somespecimen pictures for the Fred
MeC-übbin book are capital reproductions’of
the artist’s work. The Turneresque land-
scapes are the best results in color printing
that Australia has achieved thusfar, so any
likely subscribers who have been holding off
will probably give the order now that they
can see what they will get for their two
guineas.
Our wounded are to be helped by a con-
cert on August 10 in Christ Church Hall,
St. Kilda. Senator Pearce and his lady will
be there; also Mayor Hewison and his wife,
and goodness knows how many more, all at
a modest two bob a time. Miss Hobbs and
Grade Hammond are the secretaries.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

Xo Shirker : \\ heu recognition is being

the drum for old Harry Burvil, of Toongabbie
(A ic.). Somebody asked him for a subscription
towards the Red Cross funds. “Yes,” he said, “ten
quid—all the money I have in the world. But
I can work and earn more. Better men than me
have given more than all they have in their pockets.”
Bnrvil is nearly bent double, but if anybody knows a

to explain why a tree smitten by lightning’ is so
infernally difficult to burn (15. 17/0/’l5). Well, if
it was all right before it was hit, it isn't. When
1 lived in the Sorell (Tas.) district a thunderbolt
dropped on a big’ dry white-gum, split it into pieces
ranging from kindling-wood up to back-logs and
scattered it neatly over a circle 300yds, in diameter.
We picked up the pieces and carted them home, and
they burnt well and saved the wood-axe all winter.
Sammy" : If anyone can tell me a really
effective way of stopping a horse jumping fences it
will save mo a lot of swearing anti the horse a sore
head. I don’t want anyone to tell me to tic a two-
foot stick on to tlie horse’s neck, or hobble him, or
sideline him (hobble a fore foot on to a back one),
oi scotch hobble him (a mixture of ordinary hobble
and sideline). They're no good, because if a horse
really wants to get (lie other side of a fence he
doesn't mind hurting himself to do it. And I’ll choke
anyone who advises me to build my fences ten feet
higher.

“L.N.": The Papuans haven't the patience
to store the black-palm or other hardwood used
for spears and arrowheads until it seasons and dries
naturally, so they cut and scrape the timber into
shape and hold the business end above fire until
most of the contained moisture is steamed out. After
that, hot cinders and sand are mixed, and the spear
end is thrust into it until the requisite drvness and
hardness have been attained. The steaming process
foi a spear, say, one and a half inches in diameter
occupies several hours.

Slipra.il : A\ anted, a reliable method of
keeping mice from haystacks. Part of the heavy
mortality amongst stock in Victoria lately has becii
due (o the assistance the rodents have given the
drought m destroying fodder. Putting tin around

a process for the average farmer. Who's got a dead-
easy recipe?

to know what made him develop that taste. There
was no leather, wood or rag concealed about him—

appearances he was quite sane and even intelligent.

lola” : The will-o’-the-wisp is well known
m New Guinea. According to Brown Brother if is
the restless spirit of some deceased warrior roaming
the bush with a firestick or torch in search of
lood. When the light is stationary for any length of
lime the spirits are believed to be sitting around it,
yarning and cooking their food. Almost any nig.
who happens to draw one's attention to the light will
be able to point out the outlines of the ghostly
figures as they squat around the fire, and will also
draw your attention to the mumbling of the spook
limiters as they converse. These spirits have been
known to follow fishing parties during the night time,
but they are not credited with malevolent propen-
sities.

insight into games of chance, and at the same time
lelieve the monotony of a tedious performance, bv
converting the drafting race into an imaginary
Rouge et Noir table. Let ewes equal Red, wethers
Blac<\, and strangers Zero. If the sexes are present
in equal numbers, there you are. Only this afternoon
I had a run of 13 Red—l was backing Black at the
time while runs of half a dozen were common
enough. I am now engaged in perfecting a system,

‘ Outcast : As “Lagani-N.” points out. you

stream in Papua, but I don’t think they are speckled
trout. They look to me more like perch. Anyhow,
you can’t do much in the way of hunting them with-
out dynamite, and dynamite fishing is illegal in
Papua. I have got fair-sized fish with the rifle in
shallow pools, the concussion, I think, stunning them.
You can also get them at times with native vegetable
fish-poisons, and very occasionally when the nigs, are
making weirs in the streams; but somehow the
natives' seldom seem to get anything bigger than
sprat size. You can get catfish on the line up to
any size, especially in the tidal rivers of the West
and Gulf ; but catfish is only niggers’ food.
HER PRESSING ENGAGEMENTS.
JIGGITY JANE: "Don't wait, coachman —I shall be here some lime."
Moana : A new kind of medicine-man
luis been shaking the brown race up in Maori la ml
lately. He is a young iohumja named Nohi Te
Ngohc, and his specialty is the finding of the locali-
ties where certain stones, endowed with great
powers, according to Maori tradition, have been
buried for many years. He has been operating mostly
in the Waitara (North Island) district, and recently
undertook to find a long lost stone on a farm in the
presence of a lot of brown people and a few pakelms.
First of all he did a weird chant in the brown langu-
age, and ended up by praying in English. Then he
said the power had come to him, and he indicated
a spot. Two of the white men dug sft. below the
sen-face soil that bore no trace of having been
removed for many years, and struck the viauri. It was
of stone, round in shape, and elaborately carved on
top, with a hole in one side. This gibber was stolen
tiom \\ ainoogoro 45 years ago and had not been seen
or heard of since. The Maoris declare that from the
time of its disappearance they have had only
small catches of fish, but that now it has been recov-
ered they will have plenteous hauls. How Nohi Te
Ngohe finds out where the stones are is a mystery.
Perhaps his ancestors stole them and he has discov-
ered the details of their hiding-places. If that isn't
the explanation he has amazing luck, for so far he
has indicated the graves of four or five legendary
pebbles.
‘Devil-fish ': On the eastern side of For-
estier Peninsula (Tas.) a little creek about the size
of a 2in. pipe runs for a quarter of a mile along a
deep gully and then falls down a sheer 200 ft. cliff
into the Pacific. The holes in the creek above the
cliff aie full of the little spotted native trout,-and
the biggest I ever caught (8-loz.) came out of one of
them. How did they get here? No fish without
wings could come up from the sea, and it is a long
and rough walk overland from the nearest. water on
the other side.

“Outcast”: The piercing of the ear-lobe
in Papua, especially in the west, is a very im-
portant event in the neophyte’s life. The hole is
made when the patient is quite voting and is
gradually distended with a roll of grass or bamboo
and earrings of heavy wooden balls. Finallv, the
lobe is cut away by tying a length of fibre ’ very
tightly round Hie flesh, which in course of time
becomes drad and drops off. The helix of the ear
is also pierced with many small holes, and streamers
or led sago fibre are hung from them until initia-
tion time. Some of the mountain people insert a
good-sized length of bamboo in their ear-lobes and
use it as a pocket for cigarettes and other rubbish.
lionna : This scramble round the
planet in search of stuff to eat seems likely to pro-
duce a fine big crop of new pests. The other day
bOO sacks of Fiji maize dumped on a Maoriland
wharf were found to include a consignment of the
angumois moth, which is one of the most deadly
pests procurable. Now, when probably it is too late,
a rush is made to slam the door. ' That’s always

I am beat, an’ my soul is shrivelled
By years in the drought-bound lands ;
I'm sick o' dreams an’ of hope deferred
On the work o' my toil-worn hands.

Cuts fangs in a copper sky,

Stretched weird in the evenin’ glow
Silently ask of a barren sky
A gift it can’t bestow.
The sun-cracked face o’ the country
Gapes wide in piteous prayer

To a dull, heat-laden air.

An growled in calm and breeze;
An’ took my trick at a kickin' wheel
To the roar o’ the nor’-west gale,

HOW TO HAVE LONG.
BEAUTIFUL HAIR.
By a Hair Specialist.
It is not hard to stop the hair from falling
out and promote its growth if the right
means are used. There is no hope for the
scalp where the hair roots are dead and the
scalp is shiny. However, to those who have
not reached this condition, immediate steps
should be taken to stop it before it is too
late. Here is a simple recipe which you can
make at home that will stop the hair from
falling out, promote its growth, and eradi-
cate scalp eruptions and scalp humors. To
a half-pint of water add loz. bay rum, a
small box of Orlex Compound and Joz. of
glycerine, and apply to the hair, rubbing
with the finger tips, two or three times a
week. These ingredients can be obtained at
any chemist’s at very little cost and mixed
at home. This recipe not only promotes the
growth of the hair, but darkens streaked,
faded grey hair and makes it soft and
glossy.* [9.

A TRIAL BALANCE.
HANDSOME HEBERT: “What about you
spending ter-morrer afternoon with
me?”
PEROCIDE P EARL: “Yes, dear, but what are
you going to spend?”
A CHANGE OF CASTE.
HE: “Liz won't have nothin' to do with ther push now."
SHE: “No; since Billo went to the war she rechons she belongs to the Military Set."
“Romney”: Talking about unsolved
mysteries of crime, it is about time that the facts
relating to my murder
were made known. It will
be remembered that I was
found lying in a sheep-
yard with my head care-
fully split open from the
nose upwards. Alongside
me was a tomahawk with
which the deed had been
committed, and this had
been taken from an adjoining
woodheap. That a four-and-six-
penny watch was still attached
to me by a bootlace —I had no
pocket that would hold anything
smaller —proved that robbery had
not been the motive of the
assassin. I was not known to
be involved with any girl, and
the usual inquiry showed that no
swaggie had been seen in the dis-
trict. In the end the jury hedged
with “Death by the visitation of
some person or persons un-
known.” As a whole lot of drinks
depend upon the solution, it is up
to me to supply it. Noticing that
a ram in the mob was looking
rather cheap I upended him and
found him so hopelesisly mag-
gotty that any thought of cure
was absurd. So I fetched the
tomahawk from the above wood-
heap, ana brought the blunt end
down all I knew on the top of
the ram’s head. But I had for-
gotten that a ram’s poll is made
of strongly reinforced concrete
cased with india-rubber; so,
when I landed, the tomahawk sim-
ply flew back with a force equal
to its descent, the blade catching
me between the eyes. At least
that is what would have happened
if the ram had been in front of
me or my aim had not been true.
As, in point of fact, the ram was
immediately in front of my right hand and I landed
fair and square, the blade merely whizzed past my
ear with a force that ricked my elbow.
* * * *
“Cheetah”: When the drought broke in
Victoria all good cookies rejoiced. Then, as grass and
crops began to sheen the countryside stock-owners
hurriedly set about getting their shivering animals
back from the South, whither they had been sent for
meagre pickings. The cow specialist, who had in
many instances mortgaged his soul as well as the
farm for cash to buy fodder, reckoned the time had
come to begin working off the monkey. But, alas,
likewise alack, the stock started on a conspiracy of
dying. First horses died as the grass came through.
Their little Marys were full of sand licked up with
the straw served out in the drought time, and the
new grass played havoc among their innards. Then
milkers, after getting a blow-out on the freshly-
sprouted fodder, turned it up. Green fodder eaten
wet spells disaster to drought-starved cattle. One
morning a settler at Restdown, an exceedingly clean
district so far as pastures go, woke up to find eight
cows and a bull ready for the funeral. A Diggora
farmer went out to harness his seven horses and dis-
covered seven cadavers. A Pine Grove man had £2OO
worth of horse go cold without saying “Hay” or
“Neigh.” Pneumonia was the professional verdict.
A firm of stock agents who took delivery of 50 head
of cattle from Kyneton and put them in a paddock
mustered 23 next morning. In this case carrot weed
is under suspicion. And people are wondering why
stock is at a high price, and yelling for the execu-
tion of cocky because he doesn’t wheel up butter as
usual.
* * * *
“G.J.H.”: A pub at Balranald (N.S.W.)
possesses a cockatoo popularly supposed to be older
than the Ma State itself, and it presents as hopeless
an appearance as one of Holman’s reproductive works.
In the matter of abbreviation of attire cocky can give
Ghidley points, as his only covering consists of about
a dozen scraggly feathers, and his bill is as long
as a lawyer’s, and crossed like an ice-hook. He was
of the sulphur-crested variety until baldness overtook
him. According to a hint he gave me the cocky at
the Tom Ugly’s Point hotel is a comparative infant.
* * * *
“Sarto”: To feed cows on lucerne hay,
steam it well before applying, and I’ll guarantee,
even if Daisy hasn’t tasted it before, that the most
delicate part of her apparatus will not get out of
order. Draught horses will do as well on lucerne-
chaff and oats as on anything else when they’re
used to it, and in this /fiart of the Riverina, where
hay-chaff can’t be got, they have to hang out on
straw-chaff and oats.
* * * *
Australia hasn’t sent all her “hardies”
away to the war. For instance, there’s young Alick
Gosper, of Upper Colo (N.S.W.). He’s fully eight
years old, and with his weight of winters upon him
rode forth the other morning to round up a cow.
During the operations heAvas thrown and an arm was
broken. Did that stop him? No fear! He climbed
up on the brumby again and leathered old Daisy
home in No. 1 Australian style.
“Eddyson”: “ ’N’ did I never tell yeh
how they waste a fun’ral on Don Brogan ?” said
Flynn. “Tut tut, look et that now! A man do be
gettin’ short iv mem’ry in his ould age. Don was
orthinary alvviz, ’n’ had nothin’ to him would appeal
to a man iv taste ’n’ judgmint, barrin’, maybe, a

iv a three havin’ failin’ aerost the head iv him, poor

thrifty sowl, did be savin’ fer it these manny years.
‘I m bilavin’ in a sumptchis wake,’ sez she, ‘for ’tis
then a widdy body would be lookin’ fer her second,’
she sez. ‘ ’N’ a wise woman ’n’ experienced,’ she
sez, ‘will be knowin’ a man be the manner iv him
when the dthrink have a holt iv him.’ Three dozen
iv Don’s acquaintances was at the wake, tall, dthrink-
in’ men iv’ry wan iv thim. There was whisky in

cor-rner. Flat on its back it lay, wid a square-cut
hole in its belly where you dipped your servin’ free

Widdy Brogan. Manewhoile on the par-rlor-table in

Brogan, disased, proud ez a paycock wid candles
blazin’ to the four eor-rners iv him. ’Twas Stave
Burke med the coffin. ‘I was dthrunk uz Noah ’n’ his

I’ll be, plaze God, whin they lower it in the hole

THE JOB HE FANCIED.
SERGEANT: “No, you'd better clear out of
this. You're not the type of man we're
after.”
A PPLICANT: “Orright, orright. On'y I

“Hay” : Talking about water-bags, has any
Abo-reader or writer ever had a drink out of a black-
fellow’s ookwa cumbi? In the dry parts of Centralia
there are journeys to be negotiated on which fhe abo.
has to provide himself with water carried in the
handiest receptacle available. No doubt he has a
billy now, but the old-time blaekfellow used to kill a
rock wallaby, skin it carefully and turn the skin
inside out without cutting it except round the legs
and neck. Then, when the legs were tied, the cumbi
was filled to the neck, and there it was all ready to
place on top of black Nellie’s collection of cargo.
Thus the family was sure of fresh water when on the
march. I had a drink from a cumbi once when very
thirsty, and the villainous flavor of stale wallaby hair
has embittered my evening prayers ever since.
THE ANTIDOTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Many a man is driven to the public-house because
his meal is badly cooked....He begins by taking a
little alcohol, but a little invariably ends by taking
more and more. Finally, such a man becomes a
drunkard. — Prof. Anderson Stuart.
Mad from his plate of sodden beef
The bitter husband rose;
He looked afar to find relief
From gastronomic woes.
The hash-house towers that long he knew
Frowned on the twilight air;
His soul turned sick at thoughts of stew
They served the boarders there.
A “Three Course Dinner—Sixpence” caught
His fierce and wandering eye;
He wondered where the cow was bought
That made so cheap a fry.
He saw the Dago’s lights ashine
O’er crayfish in a row,
And pitied those who needs must dine
With swart Dimetrio.
From haunts where loftier hunger feeds
He turned in scorn away,
Nor lingered where the loiterer reads
The menu of the day.
A loathing of all things men eat
Had gripped him hard and sore, '
And, stern as doom, he urged his feet
Past each detested door.
The noise of gravy made him wince,
Soup music made him swear,
The yell of onions in the mince
Caused him to beat the air;
Tumultuous voices of all food
Raged on the sidewalk drear,
And struck wild discords from his mood
Till loathing grew to fear.
He crossed the street. A breath of balm
Blew on his frenzied soul;
Soft as the burden of a psalm
About his heart it stole.
He entered where the lights were gay,
He stood erect and free,
And, dashing down the coin to pay,
Said boldly: “Beer for me!”
In penny sections Hell broke loose,
As it is wont to break ;
He learned to love the amber juice
That kept his soul awake.
He drank all day and half the night
From that alluring stream,
And only paused when wholly tight
To guzzle in a dream.
The loud reformers came and went,
They pointed to his case—
The awful wreck whose days were spent
In pleasures dark and base.
But he, unmoved, still kept afloat,
A gay and grizzled sinner,
Proclaiming beer the antidote
For breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Gnat Spry”: None of the obituary
notices of Archbishop O’lleily, the kindly
Adelaide prelate who died the other day,
mention his attainments as a cabbage-
grower. Nobody could give the gentle old
man points in the art of cultivating vege-
tables, and the kitchen garden was one of
the features of his beautiful home at Glen
Osmond. Incidentally, lie had a positive
genius for financial administration. The
schools he built with one hand during his
years rule in Adelaide, while he was
keeping the diocese out of debt with the
other, stand as an enduring monument.
The French have—or recently had-—two
stock questions to put to Englishmen in
France: “Have you got munitions yet?” and
M hen are you going in for conscription?”

England can muddle through again without
conscription. The injustice, the madness of
Though he has had his 80th birthday Sam
McCaughey isn’t the father of the N.S.W.
C ouncil by a long way. In point of
yeais, both of life and of service, 11. G
Hangar takes the lead. He is 85 and'has
been saying "No” to democratic proposals
for years. TYhy Hangar should have the
light to say *No to democratic legislation,
while Clndley hasn’t the right to say “No”
to Hangars conventional coat and pants, has
never been satisfactorily explained. Dr.
Creed and Henry Moses have been legislating
without any popular authority for 30 years
this month, and half a dozen others for 25
>oars. McCaughey is a mere novice at the
game. Since Sam was reputed to know
nothing of politics George Reid naturally
looked on him as just the man for the Lc«>-

As a matter of fact, “Yes-No” was soaping
the Labor crowd at the time, and nominated
the lug squatter to sugar the pill that Fat

An indignant anti-Lahorite pretending to
be a >( Scot, and signing himself “Clan Men-
zies, rages in the Argus against Defence
Aimister Pearce for downing the ridiculous
Rut: ‘Why did Senator Pearce’s Ministry
hurl insult upon insult on Australian Scots
and ban the killed regiments? W'e will for-
give these insults and raise a thousand men
m a few days if kilts are reintroduced for
home and active service.” Apparently the
queer person would tight in a kilt, but with-
out a kilt would see the Empire damned
lust. These anonymous offers sound very
little like McTavish in kilts and very much
like Falstaff in buckram.
“Bobstay’s” interpretation :—-
A- T. Norton in his “Error of Judgment’’ (B.
1/7/’ 15) says the hapless skipper’s certificate has
been collared, and when he gets it hack in
a year s time it will be marked, “Suspended
by Order of the Court for 12 months.” Sup-
posing it is, he needn’t cry. It must be
over 25 years since the Victorian Marine Board
suspended a mariner’s ticket for six months and
prominently branded the fact upon the parchment
before returning it. The sailor mentioned the brand
to a smart lawyer, who fell upon the Board with a
writ for defamation, or libel, or slander, or piracv
oa the high and rolling seas. The Board defended
tlie case in the Supreme Court, and proudly pointed
to its' regulation on the subject, based on the pre-
cedent of the British Board of Trade. The Court
looked coldly ou the. by-law and awarded plain-
tifi V2!)0 damages and costs on the highest scale.
r When the news was cabled to London the Board of
Trade consulted counsel, and as a result nearly broke
its neck in the hurry to repeal the regulation.
Certificates are now returned unsullied.

“J.F.11.,” from London:—
When Australian prelates are not in London taking
round the hat in person, they have committees of
elderly spinsters and frivolous flappers collecting for
them. One of these proclamations of Australian
poverty—the North Queensland English Auxiliary
Association—has been holding its annual meeting.
During 1914 it cadged £lo2B—very creditable to the
sponging capacity of the girls, but very discreditable
to Church of England folks in Queensland, who are
thoroughly well able to pay their own way, and
ought to be ashamed to loaf on London charity
when London’s charity is so strained. Archdeacon
Crozier returned thanks avowedly on behalf of the
grateful Ba nanalanders of the North, dilated on “the
trying climate” and other sins of the place, and
announced that he was going to take back with him
a band of Bush Sisters to keep the Bush Brothers
company.
A now war play in blank verse —“Arma-
geddon,” by Stephen Phillips—was on the
eve of production by Martin Harvey at the
New Theatre, London, when the last mail
left. Its root idea is that the war was
hatched in Ilell, and that the Devil selected
the Kaiser as the most suitable fowl to
carry it on with all possible brutality.
There is nothing of the stick-to-the-office
lawyer about A. I>. Webb, just appointed
associate to Judge Gordon in Adelaide, suc-
ceeding E. M. Sabine, now made an S.M. In
less than 10 years’ practice Webb has done
business in three different towns before drop-
ping anchor temporarily in the Supreme
Court. The nautical metaphor is appropri-
ate, because, though his father was a lawyer
before him. the son began life as a junior sea-
man. lie also did a term as apprentice to a
timber firm before deciding to hunt the shy
and elusive Costs.
“Harrison 0.”: I note that the Archbishop
of Canterbury favors a counterblast to the
(lermhun’s “(loci Punish England!” What
is required is a comprehensive c-nrse free
from ambiguity; something that will leave
no room for doubt. Tenders might be in-
vited—the longest or any other curse not
necessarily accepted. If this is done I will
weigh in with the few remarks which the
synagogue at Amsterdam took leave of Spin-
oza in 3GoG: —
By the sentence of the angels, by the decree of the
saints, we anathematise, cut off, curse and execrate
Baruch Spinoza, in the presence of the sacred books
with the six hundred and thirteen precepts which
are written therein, with the anathema wherewith
Joshua anathematised Jericho; with the cursing*
wherewith Elisha cursed the children; and with all
the cursings which are written in the Book of the
Law; cursed be he by day, and cursed by night :
cursed when he lieth down, and cursed when he risetli
up ; cursed when he goeth out, and cursed when he
cometh in; the Lord pardon him never; the wrath
and fury of the Lord burn upon this man, and bring*
upon him all the curses which are written in the
Book of the Law. The Lord blot out his name under
Heaven. . . .There shall no man speak to him, no man
write to him, no man show him any kindness, no man
sta t \ under the same roof with him, no man come
nigh him.
If this is considered too benevolent, without
charge I will add “Henry llorsecollarY’
well-chosen remarks anent leaking roofs,
tight boots, time-payment furniture sharks'
bunions, housemaid's knee, ungrateful chil-
dren, debt collectors and sundries.
A Gippsland dairyman fined for beating
his wife and leaving her out all a wet night
pleaded that she had neglected" the cows.
More than kin and less than kine.
“Callan Park's” scheme: —
I see that Britain has again started moaning
gently about her unworthy peers—this time in rela-
tion to those who refuse to help in the war. The
list of those at the Front is a creditable one; but
there still remain many, seemingly, who, in the
words of an elderly member of the Lords, “do
nothing but hang round London gaming-dens and
theatres.” They represent the dregs of their class
—the bankrupts, the spielers, the quasi-criminals.
It has always been a puzzle to me that they do not
come to Australia. The Commonwealth is the ideal
place for the peer who has lost his money and his
self-respect, and is trying to live by his wits. This
country is rich ; it is confiding where a titled Brit-
isher is concerned ; and, above all, as regards legally
punishing peers it may be said to be impotent.
How many grasp the full purport of the rule which
lays it down that every man shall be tried by his
peers? The thing is an absolute gift to the titled
malefactor who has the brains to exploit it.
If I were (sav) Earl Bilke 1 would not remain in
wary and perilous old England for a minute longer
than it look me to collect tlie passage-money to
Australia. Arrived in the Commonwealth, 1 would
embark on a. systematic life of crime. 1 would
specialise, for obvious reasons, in the bigger things
--bank robberies, forgeries on a large scale, and so
forth. It has been calculated that in Sydney seven
crimes go undetected for every three that are dis-
covered. In Melbourne the police do a shade worse.
So, according to the law of averages, I would have a
good margin before it became necessary to answer
to even one of my crimes.
I lie worst occurs; 1 am discovered, given in
charge, taken to prison, indicted, and presented for
trial. The Court is ready. The prosecutor awaits,
with dog-like, avidity, the opportunity to destroy
me. 1 lean gracefully over the rails of the dock
and say to the Judge: “Your Honor, I, claim to be
tried by a jury of my peers.” Sensation ! There are
no peers on the jury-roll. Since Federation the
practice of employing peers as State Governors has
been gradually dropped. The war has depleted the
Commonwealth’s supply of travelling dukes. Even
the Governor-General is not a peer. You could rake
Australia with a fine comb just now, and not find
one of the breed. They would have to let me go.
Earl Bussell was tried by a jury of peers a few
years ago for bigamy. They convicted him, and he
served a short sentence. Pure carelessness. If he
had married the lady in Australia he would have
been safe.
The only danger would lie in the possibility of the
Crown importing peers. But this would be difficult
to do, except at tremendous cost of time and monev.
In all the circumstances, the authorities would pro-
bably enter a nolle prosequi.
Nor can a peer be made to give evidence on oath.
This was first disclosed in Sydney, six or seven years
ago, to the surprise of both Bench and Bar, when a
wandering peer who was called as a witness in the
Supreme Court refused to be sworn. “I give evi-
dence on my honor,” he said. And on the books
being searched he was found to be right. This, l>v
the way, is why Edward VII. was not sworn in the
Gordon-Cumming ease. He was not favored, as mam-
thought, on account of being Prince of Wales. He
gave his word of honor as a Peer of the Realm.

HE steady rise in sales of these beautiful instruments proves
their unsurpassed quality. The rapid increase in the sales
of the more expensive models

pianos—is significant and eloquent
of the growing appreciation of the
discriminating musical class, who
demand superlative quality of tone,
tasteful appearance and undoubted
durability.
Beale Pianos are entirely British.
They are manufactured in the
largest and most comprehensive
piano factory in the British Empire,

“Coot” ; Another Australian effort to cap-
ture the local market for an article hitherto
solely manufactured by the Gerhog. The
Mfirbut Co., after many experiments, has
arrived at a satisfactory machine for the
production of “slip gilt”—the trade name for
"riife strip of gilded wood let in between the
woodwork of a picture-frame and the
“lftount.” This “slip gilt” has been a Ger-
man monopoly for 30 years.
An important banking development lias
taken place in England. Lloyd’s Bank,
with 800 branches, has started a savings
bank department to do business with small
depositors. The Bank will be open on Fri-
day nights for the convenience of workers
and others who practise thrift. From a
banking standpoint it is questionable
whether the new departure is a good one.
Savings bank depositors are entitled to the
best security, the very Gibraltar of banking
, finance, namely, the support and credit of
the Government of their country. Private
joint stock banks cannot afford that guar-
afi'tee against loss to small depositors, and
Lloyd’s enterprise therefore carries elements
of risk. No private bank is absolutely safe
and sound beyond cavil. It is the old,
faulty practice of the Victorian banking
boom of 1886-1893 —to borrow money from
the public for two days and lend it privately
for two years. Of course, Lloyd’s will get
the money, but the question emerges whether
it should.
Among the curiosities of the Inky Way in
London is the Pawnbrokers’ Gazette, one
of whose proprietors died the other day leav-
ing £23,083 behind him. He bequeathed £2OO
apiece to the Pawnbrokers’ Charitable Insti-
tution and the Benevolent Society or
Assistant Pawnbrokers, but nothing at all
to Holman or other good Australian cus-
tomers.
From a brute in London: —
Guess the newest, coolest and pleasantest Australian
fashionable resort! It is being boomed in London
by Florence Smithson. Yackandandah —modest, retir-
ing, little Yackandandah. After singing for seven
weeks in Sydney, Florence could endure the heat no
longer, and fled across the Murray to Yackandandah,
where she “revelled in real bush life for a month,
“shooting and cooking my own food.” What was it
-—opossum or paddymelon? Or kangaroo or emu?
Don’t know; but she had a “most gorgeous and ex-
citing time.” “Prospected for gold,” too, with
such promising indications that she took out a miner’s
right, pegged out a claim, and received a Govern-
ment license to work 300yds. “So you see” —tri-
umphantly—“l possess a tir:y bit of Australia. ’ Dear,
dear! More absentee ownership !
“Corkonion”; Nick La Feuillade,
violinist, died in Melbourne recently. He
was associated with negro minstrelsy in
the early days of Victoria. Three troupes
had come to Melbourne before his arrival.
First Rainer’s Ethiopians. They per-
formed in a little theatre attached to the
Criterion Hotel, Collins-street west. Then
the Backus California Minstrels, performing
in Coppin’s Olympic. Third came, in 1860,
the so-called Original Christy Minstrels,
including Tom Rainford. They performed
in the Theatre Royal. Fourthly apneared
John Smith’s minstrel troupe, at the Mel-
bourne Haymarket, 1863, including La
Feuillade, with two brilliant tenors. La
Feuillade concluded that travel was fool-
hardy, and stayed in Melbourne.
“Pegasus”: Re that smell in the horse
trade. Herewith some questions that should
be answered :
(1) How many horses have been purchased by
Commonwealth Government agents, for private ship-
ping orders, at sales at which it was specially adver-
tised that Government buyers would attend?
(2) At whose expense were most of the private-
order horses fed and railed after purchase—at the
expense of the speculators or of the Government ?
(3) How many horses were rejected after being
purchased by representatives of a certain big wool
firm ?
(4) What previous experience had such represen-
tatives in buying horses for military uses?
(5) Will the Defence Department take possession
of all horses purchased by Government representa-
tives, for the latter’s private shipping orders, at the
prices paid to owners?
As to the last question, it would not be hard
to get from auctioneers who acted as agents
for the Government a full list of all horses
sold at sales at which it was specially adver-
tised that Government representatives would
attend. A comparison between that list and
a tally of the animals actually acquired by
the State would be enlightening. If no more
horses were to be bought it might be worth
letting sleeping swindlers lie. But it looks
as though Australia was only at the begin-
ning of its activities in this line.
“E.T.”: Strange that more of the long
string of Miss Braddon novels were nut
dramatised. They were all dramatic, not
to say melodramatic, and “drawing-room
melodrama” has invariably proved appetis-
ing. “Lady Audley’s Secret” in its stage
dress was popular when I was a gallery-
boy. There were pirates in those days, and
thanks to the chaotic British copyright law
“managers playing unauthorised versions”
were as thick as thieves in Vallambrosa.
Others of the Braddon works might easily
have made better plays, but no one at-
tempted to lay hands on them. The lady’s
son, the well-equipped W. B. Maxwell, dis-
plays an hereditary taste for the theatre in
his novels, and should give a really good
play if he set his mind to it. Two of his
best-known books have been adapted for
the stage, viz., “The Ragged Messenger”
and “Mrs. Thompson.” The latter is the
work of that champion adaptor, the late
Sydney Grundy, and is a talked-of produc-
tion in London, where few good plays have
been staged since “Armageddon,” with its
all-star cast, started its long run.


HOW DYSPEPTIC’S CAN AVOID
DIETING.
A SPECIALIST’S ADVICE.
A famous stomach specialist, whose writ-
ings have appeared in many languages, states
that the old plan of strict dieting for dys-
pepsia has gradually grown into disfavor,
partly on account of its weakening effect,
but chiefly because of the discovery that
nearly all stomach trouble is directly' or "in-
directly due to acidity. The stomach itself
not being responsible for this acidity, but
being, in fact, inflamed, irritated and dis-
tended thereby, it logically follows that in-
stead of diets and medicines the thing to do
is to get rid of the acid. For this purpose
half a teaspoonful of bisurated magnesia in
a little water taken immediately after meals
will be found unequalled, as it instantly
neutralises the acid, stops the fermentation
of food, dispels the gas. and thus permits the
stomach to proceed with its work without
hindrance. Owing to its prompt and certain
action bisurated magnesia, which is obtain-
able from any chemist, in either tablet or
powder form/should always be used in pre-
ference to the other forms of magnesia, such
as the milks, carbonates or oxides: and it is
doubtless due to this superiority of bisurated
magnesia that it is so extensively used in
leading hospitals and in the field ambulances
in France.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
SHRAPNEL.
The money sent from this country to Germany
has helped to buy those very guns that are now kill-
ing Australian soldiers at the Dardanelles.—BULLETIN.
It’s a long while since Bill’s father bought
him that box of toy soldiers, yet they had
a lot to do with Bill’s death the other day.
So tremendous is Fat’s fear of the Refer-
enda that even the Argus states that the
reform of the tariff would be better, “the
whole question being what duties will en-
sure the greatest industrial .efficiency to
Australia?” It quotes also against the
Referenda that incorrigible actor Holman
as saying that the increased powers of the
Referenda are immoral and disgusting,
though later it remarks that the Common-
wealth has already power to do all these
immoral and disgusting things without the
Referenda. Meantime Andrew Fisher goes
on perfecting the Referenda voting
machinery, and the next Labor Conference
will deal with the man who would wreck
almost anything for a ha’porth of limelight.
Dr. Jones, the medical inspector of Vic-
toria’s inebriate institutions, in a report
just furnished to the Government, suggests
starting at the other end and preventing the
sale of alcoholic refreshment before noon.
Between the late openers arid tho early
closers the Australian afternoon would seem
likely to be the only time when most men
will care to remember that they have a
mouth.
It is worth noting that the clamant bel-
lowings that certain things shall cease “till
the war is over” are confined to either
cheerful episodes or progressive proposals.
No "Liberal” has so far suggested that all
borrowings, other than for war purposes,
shall cease till Wilhelm has been suppressed,
or that mayors and aldermen and councillors
shall retire into private life, that Orange-
men shall quit orating about the Boyne, or
the parson lose the collection plate and the
bailiff go out of business. All these per-
formers and performances are, it seems,
necessary to the proper and effective con-
duct of the war, which is the sole business
in hand at present.
When the war bumped Broken Hill it
hurt the very place that would have been
given a great push ahead if Australia had
had more sense and patriotism than it was
afflicted with in the past. At the end of
1913 there were 8788 men employed in the
mines; but the number had slumped by the
end of December to 4459. Since then em-
ployment has looked up a bit, till at the
end of June there were 5201 men working—
-1741 of them on half-time. Yet if the
Broken Hill mines were located in Germany
or U.S.A. they would be the centre of a
feverish scramble for the raw materials
which war demands; or, to put it the other
way, if the smelting and other metal works
which the mines have been supplying had
been in Australia instead of in Germany,
Broken Hill would have avoided a lot of
unemployment, and Australia could have
earned a great deal of very necessary cash,
not to mention the grateful thanks of the
Allies, who are now forced to buy spelter
from America at 500 per cent, advance on
the quotation of 12 months ago.
Within the last couple of weeks or so
three separate imported Governors, each with
a retinue of expensively apparelled assist-
ants, and surrounded by the pomp and cir-
cumstance of khaki and policemen, have
driven ceremoniously to three Labor-con-
trolled State Houses of Parliament in Aus-
tralia, placed three cocked hats in places of
safety, commanded Black Rods to summon an
audience, and then, producing a sheet of
paper, proceeded to deliver a Speech which
was not a speech, but a composition from
the pen of a handy politician. Each decora-
tive Nibs has said the same old thing, dished
up some ancient news and intimated that
Bills to accomplish so and so and such and
such would be submitted in due course. Then
he has bowed with great solemnity to the
Black Rod. picked up his hat and taken him-
self off amidst loud applause, through a
crowd of small boys. Everyone knows it is all
frantically absurd—yet not a Parliamentary
Labor voice is lifted in remonstrance. This
paper is beginning to have a dim suspicion
that as soon as a man gets into Parliament
a capacity to admire the entrancing beauty
of flummery becomes his most cherished
possession.
Lysaght’s, who run the only wire-netting
factory in Australia, write : —-
Owing to the cost of spelter having increased 500
per cent, since the outbreak of the war, and the cost
of wire over 100 per cent., we have had to corres-
pondingly increase our prices for netting, which has
restricted the demand. If, however, we had not
gone in at once last year and secured supplies of
wire and zinc at considerable risk and expense, the
country would have been without any netting at all
As the position now stands, we can supply all the
netting required, if those needing it care to pay the
increased price.
Australia is no doubt duly grateful to
Lysaght’s for jumping in last year and pur-
chasing zinc and wire. The serious part
of the matter is that, if the co. hadn’t taken
that risk, “the country would have been
without any netting at all.” Yet, as re-
marked once or twice before, this is a
country with one of the finest coal supplies
in the world,- skirting the seaboard for at
least 200 miles; with iron ores of excep-
tional quality also handy to the coast; and
with the largest available supplies of zinc
ore in the world, hundreds of thousands of
tons of if actually hauled to the surface.
Nevertheless, practically none of the wire
used in Australia is of Australian manu-
facture, and all the metallic zinc produced
in the country is the comparative handful
distilled In the Broken Hill Prop.’s few pots
at Port Pirie. Lysaght’s have done their
part in developing Australian manufactures.
It is humiliating that other industries have
been so neglected that, had the co. not
plunged and thus secured supplies of wire
and spelter last year, its works would now
have had to close for lack of raw material.
The sublimest height in connection with
the "Liberal” movement to hang things up
has been reached in Victoria, where the pro-
posal to amalgamate a dozen miniature
municipalities with their neighbors is
denounced as unseemly and disloyal "while
the people’s minds are distracted by the
war.”
THE OTHER POINT OF MEW.
George Reid on learning that his “ friends” are trying to prevent his return to
Australian polities.
The All-British Association at Perth
lately made the horrifying discovery that
the city’s imported postal pillar-boxes were
decorated in the German national colors and
sported headpieces resembling spiked hel-
mets. Therefore I’.M.G. Spence is being
threatened that, unless these unpatriotic
urns are attired in fresh coats of paint and
have their threatening extremities knocked
-off, the local inhabitants will defy law and
order and do the job themselves. Up to
the present no one has forwarded an ulti-
matum to Fisher that, unless pillar-boxes
and other necessary commodities are culti-
vated more profusely in the Commonwealth,
Westralia will do without legislators who
reckon any excuse good enough for deferring
tlie work of tariff reform.
THE REGIMENTAL UNIONIST.
FIRST KANGAROO: “ Don’t yeh wish yeh had
a soldierly I bearing, like English
reg’lars ?”
SECOND D ITTO: “No good to me. A bloke'd
think he was a blanky blackleg working
overtime if he couldn’t put his hands in
his pockets off parade.”
The latest tale about the N.S.W. “cheap
fish” fiasco is that the Ministry, which
cabled for three foreign-built trawlers on
the ground that they couldn’t be built in
Australia “at short notice,” proposes to
lease or sell the vessels and have three other
craft constructed in Sydney to suit local
conditions. The awful muddle made of this
business, from the moment the trawlers
were ordered to the hour of the last sale of
fish to middlemen at 5 a.m.. has no connec-
tion with the merits of public fishmongering.
It merely emphasises that Public Enterprise
can fail just as badly as Private Enterprise
if the administration falls into the wrong
hands.
From the reported proceedings of the
National Parliament: —
Mr. Kelly : Will the Assistant Minister of Defence
inquire into the rumor that eight union barbers who
have been sent to the training camp in Victoria are
charging more than the award rates for haircutting
and shaving, and, if so, will he take steps to prevent
the soldiers from being exploited?
Mr. Jensen: I shall make inquiries into the
matter.
Mr. Kelly belongs to the party which doesn't
think that Parliament or the people should
be troubled with the Referenda, the tariff or
other small matters while there are life-and-
death problems to grapple with.
VOICES IN THE GALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now the night is full of whispers, telling that the
ship is frail,
And we can but sit and listen to the Voices in the
Gale;
For they treat us all as children (though they call
on us as men),
Saying: “Truth must not he published lest the foe
should strike again!’’
Still the puny, coward voices t Drown the rumor
and the tale!
With a trumpet-blast of candor quell the Voices in
the Gale!
Oh, the skies gave ample warning ere the midnight
tempest broke :
But they would not heed their prophet, though with
all his heart lie spoke ;
Now, ’neath hatches battened under, we defy the
ocean’s flail,
But our hearts are torn and tortured by the Voices
in the Gale.
Are they friends or are they foemen? Are they
speaking truth or lies ?
Can’t they tell tis, can’t they trust us, as before
the storm she flies!
Are we weaker than our fathers ? Must they shield
its from the blast,
Till, ’midst foam and wrack, uncalled on, we encoun-
ter Truth at last?
Must we sit distraught in darkness, and like help-
less women rail,
Whilst we listen to the voices—haunting Voices in
the Gale?
'England, call us, and we’ll answer, to the side-
drum’s valiant beat
And the bugle’s song triumphant, ev'ry man upon his
feet!

GAME!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Iloyle boasts that he belongs to the only
Government game to borrow money for carrying on
a vigorous developmental policy.— Sydney Telegraph.
We do not fear the mortgage deed,
Nor dread tho IOU:
Though millions to our debts we add,
Our courage bears us through.
We dare to be as Daniel,
We dare to stand a loan,
And pay for anything we want
With money not our own.
The charge of mounted interest
Still leaves us undismayed.
The gamest Government there is,
We borrow unafraid !
We bravely take the easy road,
And live on others’ fat.
But work is good ; and there’s no doubt
We leave the future that.

GRINDING THE TEETH WHILE
ASLEEP.
STRONG INDICATION OF WORMS.
One of the most pronounced symptoms of
wtorms in children is grinding the teeth and
suddenly starting up out of sleep. There are
many symptoms of this most distressing
ĥ
complaint, from which
not only children suffer
but adults also. When
there is a tendency to
pick the nose, and the
bowels are irregular,
sometimes constipated
and other times re-
laxed, the appetite
variable, a copious flow
of saliva and a swell-
ing of the upper lip,
there is strong evidence
of the presence of worms. The best proof
of worms is worms, and if their presence is
suspected immediate steps should be taken
to positively establish the fact, and when
once established Comstock’s “Dead Shot”
Worm Pellets should be administered
according to directions. Worms require a
specific medicine, and there is no remedy
so effective as these pellets. They kill the;
worms, destroy their eggs, and dislodge
their nests.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal prepara-
tion for the eradication of worms in children
and adults. For sale by all chemists and
storekeepers, price 3s. 6d. per packet; or

SPORTING
NOTIONS
hen the I' ederated Amateur Sporting
Association of Victoria some time ago issued an
appeal for the “efficient representation of Australia
at the Olympic games to be held in Berlin, and to
organise a band of absolute champions to impress
the world with the physic al development of the Aus-
tralian,” it looked a mighty big thing; but it was
nothing to the appeal issued last week by the same
body. It was to amateur sportsmen to “organise a
band to join our best and bravest, who are assisting'
in crushing Berlin, ‘Deutschland über alles,’ and the
merciless militarism it stands for.” There was
nothing about “impressing the world.” That job
was done 10 weeks ago.
* * * *
They keep cross-country racing on the
boil in midwintry Melbourne by publishing the
weights for the big Hurdle and Steeple at Caulfield
on the day when Ikey Mo celebrates his joyous set-
tling over the Nationals. The “Australian” Hurdle
(3t miles) and Steeple (four miles) come five weeks
later than the corresponding events at Flemington,
and Ikey books a terrible lot of wagers—some of
which are decoys—during those five weeks. Ikey’s
business prospects are as bright as usual this year,
the present war and bygone drought notwithstand-
ing'-, Fifteen of the G. N. Hurdle Racla starters are
eligible to go again at Caulfield, and there are others.
Rathfarnham, the dashing' winner, has a stable com-
panion, Vengeful, among the minimum weights, and
he is said to be a promising novice. One of Eric
Connelly’s mysteries, Klinger, has a reputation which
may be genuine; but a proved performer is worth
two in the bush. Rathfarnham, although he is 2st.
up in the weights, has an undeniable chance. The
records show that a Grand National winner in the
9st. division can carry a lot more burden to victory
at Caulfield. Marmont, York, Realm and Arquebuse
did it in their respective years. Uxbridge, who ran
second for the Grand National with 9st. 101 b. up,
won the longer race at Caulfield carrying lOst. 71b.
And Rathfarnham is a finer-looking beast than any
of them. Still he is up 2st., whilst Jack Rice, from
Sydney, is down 121 b. ; likewise Flavel who was pal-
pably short of condition in the Grand National. And
a difference of -101 b. is a big difference to make light
of in a 31-mile journey. Nothing entered for the
Australian Hurdle can be regarded as a “good thin"”
just now.
The same remark applies to the Steeplechase,
though here the range of reasonable selection is nar-
rowed down considerably as regards the recognised
chasers. Possibly something that has been restricted
to the little sticks hitherto will be found good enough
for the biggest jumps at Caulfield.

At a recent meeting at Albion Park (Q.)
the owner of a disqualified horse used his whip
lavishly on the stewards. He was fined £5 on each
of three charges of assault, and Bananaland Turf
Club proposes to further add to the satisfaction of
the walloped and the repentance of the walloper.

“Saddle and Silk” : Somebody was recently
asking for particulars as to the greatest number of
wins by a jockey at a race meeting. I dunno ; but
this may be deposited as something special: Jockey
Barney, at four meetings in Bananaland, within a
month brought home 19 winners out of 27 mounts.

The disqualification axe fell on a trio of
top-notch jockeys in Australia last week. J. Ivillorn
was sent out for three years by the Y.R.C. ; W.
Black went into retirement for two years at the
bidding of A. J.C. stewards; and E. McKell was
switched off for 12 months at Albion Park (Bris-
bane). They are cousins of the elite of the profes-
sion in the Commonwealth, and the cold, uncom-
promising way in which they were plucked down
indicates that the said elite is not all it’s cracked
up to be.
“0.K.”: Jockey Joe Ivillorn, the crack
performer at Melbourne pony meetings before he took
to licensed courses, was sentenced to three years’ dis-
qualification by the Y.R.C. stipes for having pulled
a mare (Linrose) in a race at the recent Y.R.C.
meeting, where her stable companion, Dumfries,
started favorite. On the second day Linrose started
favorite in a similar event and won. The incon-
sistency in the two performances, and in the betting
incidental thereto, was too glaring to escape public
outcry. The stipes decided that Ivillorn had done
the alleged pulling without the authority of F. Fouls-
ham, the mare’s owner and trainer, so the jockey’s
appeal to the V.R.C. committee looked very like a
demand for a reduction of the sentence on the ground
that the wires of the swindle had been worked bv
somebody else. Evidently the principal early backer
of Dumfries must have known something, and the
books who laid 10 to 1 Linrose when she ran so
badly must have smelt the mare’s deadness. Also,
her chief backer when she achieved the “striking
reversal of form” must have known something. The
hearing of Killorn’s appeal has been postponed to
Friday of this week, and meanwhile one or two clever
people are quaking in their sox. Revelations, seem-
ingly, have already been made to at least two of the
V.R.C. committeemen; but in these star-chamber
eases the outside world never learns how much has
been revealed. Nobody knows whether the evidence
was in accordance with the verdict, or the verdict
was a satire on the evidence. We only know that if
the whole of the truth came out the whole of the
racing world didn’t get it.
“Sheila”: If tlie A.J.C. is not a murther-
ing lot uv nefaryus Prodestans for why. did they
club down Sheila Pat and the owner uv the mare,
me frind Patrick Dennis O’Brien, for two rears
dating from the twilfth uv July ? Will yez tell me
that ?
* * * *
|One reply to the “stop racing” cranks
inj Victoria is the fact that since the start of the
war the V.R.C., which is only allowed to race on
16; days a year, has been instrumental in increasing
the various patriotic funds by £16,000. Further-
more, a suggestion is to be considered at the club’s
annual meeting at the beginning of August that the
whole of this year’s profits, dating from the com-
mencement of the present month, should go towards
such funds.
A chaser with a fine record in Maoriland
this season is the Lethe gelding Soporific, who
humped list, to victory in the Hawkes Bay Steeple-
ohase the other day. This year he has had seven
starts across country, and has won five times and
been unplaced twice. The two unrewarded efforts
were entirely due to failure to complete the course.
Once he fell and once he ran off. Very few nags
can claim as good record over fences.
“Snell”: This is the sad case of an ami-
able Hebrew who mayafce called Nosebag because of
his two most conspicuous features. He complained
in woeful wise to two of the brethren, Isaac Flat-
feet and Isadore Vaddle, of the flagrant injustice done
him by the jockey boy, Featherwait. “I gif him 10
kvid to pull Two Straws, und vot does he do? He
vins, der scountril!” Isaac Flatfeet groaned, Isa-
dore Vaddle swore. Isaac, it turned out, had given
Featherwait £lO, too, and Isadore had given him a
fiver, both hoping to induce him to lose. Nosebag
was dumbfounded at this further proof of- Feather-
wait’s scoundrelism. “Und yet he vins!” he gasped.
“I tell you vat. Ve ought to gonsider vether ve
nod repord him to the sdewarts for dishonestly.”
The big Metropolitan Trotting Chib of
Christchurch (M.L.) raked in £37,359 during the
season just closed, and handed out £31,434. As this
i® n 't the first year when the club hasn’t handed out
all it lias laid its fing-ers on, its assets exceed its
liabilities by £33,542. During the year it scattered
£19,800 in stakes, which was £3135 more than it
gave away the previous season, and it passed the
Government, by way of tax, £6972. The great
success of this famous club and the fact that ’it cir-
culates over £30,000 per annum is directly due to
the tote.
A recent argument in Australia gets some
additional fuel from the report of a cricket match
which took place at Leeds, when the dual experi-
ment was tried of having the stumps two inches
higher and the over extended to eight balls. The
teams were “Remains” of Yorkshire (the rest hav-
ing gone to the war) and the Leeds “Pals” ; and the
scores were seven for 231 and 150 respectively.
Bowler Rhodes said the eight deliveries made no
difference physically, and as to the extra height of
the stumps, only one of his victims would have
escaped if the sticks had been the ordinary length.
Hirst likes the longer over and reckons it saves time
and does not tire more, as the trundler gets an
extra spell. The higher stumps were good for a
bowler on a perfect wicket, but had little effect if
the pitch was bad. Booth agreed as to the sticks,
but found the tacked-on portion of the over tiring.
But he is fast. He admitted that the additional two
balls would not matter to a medium-pace bowler.
Dolphin, as wicket-keeper, liked both changes, though
of course it mattered little to him in his own work.
He thought slow bowlers would benefit most.
ALF BAUD, skipper of Carlton (Vic.), who
will shortly leave to play in the big game
at Gallipoli.
Australia lost a likely-looking cricketer
last week by the death of John Suttor, of Mel-
bourne. About three years ago he was practically
unknown, but joining St. Kilda he surprised the
critics by his fine all-round play. So rapidly did
he come to the front that in his first season he was
gathered into the Vic. Eleven.
Lord Hawke, presiding at the annual
meeting of the Marylebone C. C., announced that the
Oxford v. Cambridge and Eton n,. Harrow matches,
with their attendant luncheon-picnics, would be oft',
“it goes without saying,” this summer, but he hoped
that all the schools would play their usual matches
on their own grounds. “It would be a pity to damp
the ardor of boys, even in war-time,” and the
M.C.C., which has a regular round of fixtures with
the big schools, will carry them out. As for first-
class county cricket, it slumps, as a matter of
course. “I think it is well within the mark to say
that 75 per cent, of those playing last season are, in
•one capacitv or another, serving in the army or
navy.” , Similarly, every other section of athletes has
done its duty, “with one notable exception”—which
is, doubtless, a dig at the professional Soccer foot-
ballers.

,T. 11. Bennett, the Canterbury and M.L.
xep. cricketer, who has been one of the star bowlers
In Loan Land for many years, has changed his
flannels for a suit of khaki and has grabbed a gun
to help to out the Turks. Cricketers in Maoriland
haven’t rushed into the disturbance like the muddied
oafs have, and it is hoped that Bennett’s good
example will be followed by a lot of the men who
have been comrades with him on other fields.
A. W. Green, who has thrown up the job
■of managing the purse of N.S.W. Cricket Associa-
tion, has been conspicuous in the game in the Ma
State for over a score of years. He was first trea-
surer on the Australian Board of Control, and he and
W. P. McElhone were the initial N.S.W. reps, on
that body.

“Jean S.” : Cecilia Wright, mentioned in
B. 8/7/’ 15, is “some kid,” believe me. She is the
hearer of a large document signed by U.S. Naval
Secretary Daniels, and endorsed by Woodrow Wilson
and William J. Bryan, thanking her for the help of
her warble during an official requiem service field
over the grave of the U.S.S. Maine in Havana Harbor.
On the strength of this missive “Cissy” describes
herself as the “Daughter of the U.S. Navy,” with
the self-appointed mission of “cementing the ties
which already bind Great Britain and her Colonies
with the United States both in sentiment and blood.”
Incidentally a cutting from El Mundo (Havana) tells
me that she wrote up the Johnson-Willard scrap for
that journal in Spanish, and previously scribbled on
the Ritchie-Welsh and Johnson-Moran disturbances
for a couple of London papers. There is a great gap
between the Crimson Bond and the Crimson Biff, but
“Cissy” seems to bridge it without difficulty.

There was only one League match that
counted in Melbourne on Saturday—Collingwood v.
Melb. A large crowd gathered in expectation of
seeing the Magpies plucked, but those birds are
tough, and when the scramble had concluded the
score was: Colli ngwood, 93 ; Melbourne, 54. A fea-
ture of the proceedings was the play of the two top-
notch goal-kickers, Lee and Park. Latter shone bril-
liantly last season in front of a weak ’Varsity team;
this season, better supported, he hasn’t done so well.
Lee is a phenomenon. Three and four years back he
was League champion, then repeated injuries to a
damaged knee —he played awhile with an aluminium
shield—laid him off for a season. Last year he did
well; this year, with such tallies as nine goals
against Carlton, eight against St. Kilda, and four on
Saturday, he is away ahead of all competitors. Yet,
hefty athlete though he is, no doctor would pass him
for enlistment. In the other games Fitzroy dumped
St. Kilda, Carlton trounced Essendon, and Richmond
beat Geelong.
* * *■ *
Fitzroy, one of the four leaders in Vic-
torian League toeball, will very soon lose the ser-
vices of their brilliant captain, Percy Parratt. He
has decided to show a practical example to his team,
and help to boot the Turk.
On Saturday the Association closed its
preliminary rounds, and proceeds at once to the
finals. i\s it happened, no club will suffer much
by the cut off, only P’ran having a dim hope of
reaching the four. As for the financial part of the
matter, two instances will show how much, money
there is in Ass. ’ball. Brunswick started the season
£7O in debt, and promised its players 15s. a week
ei <c 1 ow it is passing the plate round in a vain
effort to rake in enough to give them ss. a week.
Also, when ’Town played Hawthorn a while back the
net proceeds were 11s. 9d. You can’t get many exes,
out of that.

Latrobe, one of the strongest football clubs
in the north of Tassy, has been compelled to drop out
of the premiership struggle through the enlistment
of nearly all its members. The way our athletes
are scooting out of Australia reminds The Bulletin
of the way Capital flees from the country, or, rather,
the way it says it will flee because of the general
worthlessness of the rising generation.

These N.S.W. League football stars are
taking a leaf out of the Book of Pugs, the first chap-
ter of which is; “Thou shalt blow off to the reporters
previous to an engagement how surely thou wilt deal
with thy opponent” ; and the second chapter of which
is: “When thou hast been well walloped thou shalt
arise and explain what it is thv purpose to do unto
him next time.” Thus the captain of Eastern Suburbs
held forth last Week: “I know Balmain beat us in
the| first round, and I know how they did it. All I
have to say now is that I am confident we can reverse
that result on Saturday, and in that I am supported
by every member of the team who will play with
me.”_ And when the battle had raged and the
remains had been swept up on Saturday, lo ! likewise
la! East had been blotted out again by 14 points
to seven, and Balmain was still, with Glebe, leading
the competition (18 points each), Eastern Suburbs
being credited with 10 points.
Glebe conducted a massacre at North Sydney on
Saturday. The victim was the local team, ancl the
wounds inflicted on one side amounted to 59 and on
the other to three 1 The corpse is at the bottom
of the League competition ladder with “two” opposite
its name. Meaning dead enough to last through
two general resurrections.

“Oriel”; Nowadays many a black
brother in Queensland is handier with the cue than
the boomerang. In a pub at Alpha the other day
one accommodating abo. played me 100-up. He went
out in two hits. Remarkably keen eyesight is, I
think, the main cause of the expertness of the black.

When young Kraemer was introduced to
the crowd at Sydney Stadium a week or two ago
cheek-by-jowl with Fighting Billy Murray, Red
Watson and Joe Bonds, most people reckoned that if
the others were a tough lot here at least was a
Yankee lemon. When it was announced that the lad’s
first match would be with Billy McNabb, the copper-
headed butcher from Maitland, everyone counted on
it being easy meat for Billy. Kraemer is a pale,
fair-haired, retiring-looking youth whom the average
man would take for the junior in the mercery de-
partment. Anything more unlike a pug has never
been seen in Australia, before. But at Melbourne on
Saturday when Kraemer and McNabb got together
Billy received a hurtful lesson. The stranger turned
out to be a beautiful boxer, and standing up to the
local product gave him a severe drubbing. McNabb
was in a bad way at the thirteenth collision, and at
the end of the next, after complaining of a twisted
ankle, his towel fluttered in the breeze. The winner
had a glass of milk and went languidly home.
If any Australian is particularly ' fit to
fight Abdul one would imagine it would be Herb
McCoy, lightweight champion, hard as nails, fit and
full of pluck. All he needs is a trifle of training ;
yet when he went to enlist the other day the cast-
iron regulations blocked him because his teeth are
store goods. They have kept him fit for years, but the
army bosses said No! The same day a Hawksburn
(Vic.) man, who had been rejected five- times on
account of his artificial teeth, lined up once more
and masticated a hard dog-biscuit before the exam-
ining medico. The demonstration of dental fitness
got him through.
* * * *
The fight between Alf Morey and Volaire,
the biggest thing of its kind seen for some time
in Adelaide, where the cult of boxing grows very
slowly indeed, was a weird affair. The Frenchman,
who looked to be giving a lot in the matter of
weight, was out for strenuous exercise. If ; points
went only for attacking he must have scored an enor-
mous lead. His trouble was that his blows didn’t
matter when they got there. On the other hand, the
Westralian—-who lately, on his own grounid, won
from Volaire after going the whole 20 rounds —hit
seldom, but with effect. Volaire was. down for' vari-
ous periods from the 6th forwards, but battled on
with unfailing pluck, and still attacked whenever
he could. In the 10th Morey, who had twice com-
plained of hitting-low, got a nasty one, and was
apparently in pain. In the awful noise that fol-
lowed it could not be gathered whether referee
Toohey, in ordering- the men to their corners, was
actually disqualifying Volaire or not. The one thing
clear was that the Frenchman’s second climbed into
the ring to argue the matter; and, of course, that
finished him.

“Y.Z.” : For the second time I come upon
Uriah as the Christian name of a pugilist. The
first, you remember, was Uriah the Hittite.
Fred G. Shaw, an English angler who has
fished in most parts of the world, has published a
eulogy of Maoriland as a fishing ground. He points
out that the fisherman there has the choice of either
wet or dry fly-fishing, spinning or trolling, “with
the certainty that in every district he visits he will
not only find abundance of fish, but fish whose size
and fighting qualities are unequalled.” Shaw reckons
that the reasons the rainbow and the brown trout
grow to a size unknown elsewhere and multiply so
rapidly are, first, the abundant supply of natural
food; secondly, the favorable climatic and meteoro-
logical conditions; anil, thirdly, the absence of
enemies of their own kind to prey upon them.
Australian professional wheelmen are
flashing on Uncle Sam’s tracks with as much bril-
liancy as ever, or more. Recently a half-mile
championship ended with Grenda, Goullet and Spears
in that order, and the almost invincible Kramer in
the fourth place.
It isn’t often that the scratch-mark man
wins an open handicap, but 11. Hayden, Ma's ama-
teur champion over five miles, managed it a few
days ago at Gladesville, when the N.S.W. A.A.A.
conducted a five-miles gallop. Hayden was giving
away long starts, but he won without straining
himself.
The great amateur negro sprinter, Howard
Drew (“the Springfield Flier”), has retired from
the track. Two years ago he raged over the 100yds.
in 9 3-ssec. —equal to the amateur record—and fail-
ure this year to do better than lOsec. greatly dis-
appointed him. He quitted because he said he
wasn’t going to move along like a funeral till he
was dead. Good judges agree that he was the world’s
greatest sprinter in recent years.
Lancaster Park, the splendid athletic
ground at Christchurch, the finest in Maoriland, and
famous all over Australasia, looks like being lost
to_ sporting bodies owing to the war. It was
originally the property of a private co. that for a
long time was in serious financial difficulties.; but a
few years ago the Canterbury Cricket Association
and the Rugby Union took it over and put it under
joint control. .After making many improvements
they had to shoulder a mortgage of £lO,OOO. They
obtained the money at ii per cent., on condition
that £2OOO was repaid early in 1916. Then came
the war, and on its heels the mortgagee with an
intimation that he will want the cash. Also, the
joint control is in trouble with the interest bill and
with Mr. General Expenses. In normal seasons the
park's share of the gate receipts •from football ran
from £3O to £BO per week ; but this season the
average has been about £3 per week! In addition,
the ground derives its revenue from the visits
of toeball and cricket teams; but -this season all
such tours are off, and the income is ditto. So the
controlling bodies are faced with the task of raising
at least £4OOO in the next 12 months by other
means. If they fail the only way out is to hand
the property over to the land speculator to be cut
into building sites. If only on account of its tradi-
tions it' deserves a better fate.
A game that is forging ahead in certain
parts of Maoriland is basket-ball, which was origin-
ally imported from U.S.A., along with various
Y.M.C.A. instructors. Dunedin has got so far : with
the transplanted sport that the Otago Basket-ball
Union has come into existence with five clubs affili-
ated l:o it. At least two good grounds have been
secured, and inter-club matches are to be played
fortnightly in the Scawtch metropolis.
That freak “missioner,” Billy Sunday, of
U.S.A.—the only place he could possibly operate—
was one of the big baseball players of his day. He
was telling the prisoners in Sing Sing something
about it recently, and recalled one of the greatest
games he ever took part in. A ball was knocked
away over his head in the ninth innings when the
opposing side w er e two runs behind, had one out and
three men on bases. He had been converted the day
before, and his prayer, as he ran after the ball, was:
“O God, if You ever helped anybody, now is the time
to help me, and You haven’t got much time to make
up Your mind.” Billy says he -was the first player
to make a circuit of the diamond in 14sec. from a
standing start. There was no interval for refresh-
ments on that journey.

The Killing of Superfluous Hair.
It is easy to remove superfluous flair tem-
porarily, but to remove it permanently is
unite another matter. Not many women know
that for this purpose such a simple substance
as powdered pheminol may be used, applied
directly to the hair. The recommended treat-
ment is designed not merely to instantly re-
move the hair, but also to eventually kill the
roots entirely. Almost any chemist could
supply an ounce of pheminol. which quantity
should be sufficient.
Renewing Complexions by Absorption.
If your complexion is marred with sallow-
ness. moth patches, pimples or freckles, it is
useless to potter with powders and paints,
lotions, creams and things, in an effort to get
rid of the trouble. Unless you have some
ability as an artist you will mar your appear-
ance still more. The new and rational way
is to take off the complexion itself, with all
its offensive marks. Just get some pure
meroolised wax at the chemist’s and use at
night the same as cold cream. -Remove next
morning with water and soap, following with
dash of cold water. The mereolised wax
absorbs the half-dead scarf skin in flaky par-
ticles, so gradually no one guesses you are
treating your face —unless it be by the result,
which is truly wonderful. There is nothing-
like it for bestowing a natural, healthy and
beautiful complexion.
Hair Culture.
There is no excuse for falling hair: no ex-
cuse for thin, sick hair, or bald spots. No
beauty of features can make up for a distress-
ing lack of hair growth, and the following
formula will positively force the hair to grow.
.Mix about an ounce of boranium in 1-pint of
bay rum, shake the bottle well and allow it
in stand for half an hour, then add 1-pint of
fresh cold water and strain. Rub well into
the scalp, and in two weeks’ time look for the
new growth: you will not require a micro-
scope to see it.
A “Blackhead” Secret.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go together, but can be instantly cor-
reefed by a unique new process. A tablet ,
stymol. obtained from the chemist's, is aropi
in a tumbler of hot water, which will them
course, “li ■/;/.” briskly. When the effervescen-
lias subsided the face is bathed wit.h >
styimd charaed water and then dried witn a
towel. The offending blackheads, of tneii
own accord, come right off on the towel, ti
large, oily pores immediately contract an
efface themselves naturally. There is no
squeezing, forcing or any drastic action, tne
skin is left uninjured, smooth, soft and cool.
A few such treatments should be taken at m
tervals of three or four days thereafter m
order to insure the permanence of the pleas-
ing result so quickly obtained.
Don’t Have Grey Hail*.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap I"
both men and women while Still ill the prime
of life. Hair dyes ure not advisable because
they are always obvious, inconvenient and
often downright injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to
a natural color in a perfectly harmless maw
ner. You have only to get an ounce of tamma-
lite concentrate from your chemist and mix it
with four ounces of bay rum to prove this,
Apply this simple and harmless lotion for a
few nights to the hair with a small spoilm
and the greyness will gradually disappear,
The lotion is neither sticky hot greasy, and
has been proved over and over again for
generations past by those in possession of the
formula.
About Shampoos.
To <1 note an eminent London beauty special-
ist: “The slimy egg cannot dissolve the scalp
impurities, but only adds to the trouble by
completely choking Hie pores with attimal
matter.” The substance sticks, decomposes,
thereby causing the hair to assume d dead,
“dull color,” Avoid eggs (and Soap, too) ,on
your liaif. Try the delightful preparation
made by stirring a teaspooiiful of staihtx in
a cup of hot water. It will bring out Hew
beauty possibilities ill your hair, will clear
and prevent dandruff, and leave that fine,
fluffy effect so much sought after. It alsn
removes excess oil or greasiness. t*l

“Xorbell”: These “extra ladies’’ are
beyond the horizon in the matter of swank.
At rehearsal one day an expensively-frocked
beauty was promoted to the speaking of a
line. She had to say: "Did you ring, sir'.'”
—nothing more. Her “part” was duly
handed to her, scribbled out on a half-sheer
of notepaper. She looked at it critically for
a moment, then floated down to the prompt
table. "If you please,” she cooed, “will
you kaindly have this taype-wi*itten for me?
Ai naiver study from manuscript!”
Ben Fuller, who came over from Maori-
land to give Brennan’s circuit a hand out of
its troubles, has just bought the freeholds of
the Gaiety Theatre and the Palace Hotel
and the leaseholds of the Bijou Theatre and
the Palace Hotel Arcade, all of Melbourne.
The figure mentioned is £150,000, and a burn-
ing desire to give Bourke-street more vaude-
ville is at the bottom of it all. '
J. C. Jardine, who recently lost an eye
while playing in “The Kelly Gang,” has
landed £2OO under the Westralian Workers’
Compensation Act, defendants being George
Willoughby, Ltd. A wad from a revolver
fired by another actor set the trouble going.
“Harrison O.”: If stage ladies go much
further in their efforts to become whiter
than the snow no'male mime will dare go
on unless dressed to run an ice-cream
barrow. At the recent first-night of a
musical comedy the loudest laughs were
during a sentimental duet, because of the
lady's complexion transferring itself to her
partner's dress suit. The poor man did not
acquire merely a patch of powder; his
shoulders, sleeves and lapels were barred
with it till he looked like the hide of a zebra.
Failing to see that the lie-lover was wearing
the flour of chivalry, the house broke into
merriment. Shaw, when critic of the
Saturday Review, snorted savagely against
the absurd manner in which some actresses
ran riot with the powder nul’f or trowel,
and brutally informed a well-known lady
that she might find soap and water an
excellent cosmetic.
Some 20-odd years ago, when Tommy
Bent, Jimmy Munro and Matthew Davies
were riding on the top of a land boom in
Melbourne, when suburban paddocks were
gold-mines on paper and sites in Collins-
street changed hands every afternoon at a
million pounds or so a foot, the Government
imported from London at an absurd cost of
£5OOO a Jewish conductor named Cowen to
manasre the musical department of a Mel-
bourne International Exhibition. This
Cowen, who is now a knight, fancies him-
self most as a joker; and in that capacity
he has just brought out a little book en-
titled “Music As She Is Wrote: A Glossary
of Musical Terms (Very Much) Up-to-
Date.” For instance: —
\htist. Anyone of any nationality (except
British) who plays, sings or composes.
Substitute “Australian” for “British” and
you get the true reason why Cowen was
brought to, shake a stick among better men
in Australia.
“First Old Man”: If I were a dramatist,
one lucky enough to have a plat put into
rehearsal, the first thing I would do would
be to read the piece to the mummers who
were to impersonate my characters. I have
seen that plan work well on many an occa-
sion—it lets each member of the cast see
bow he fits into the general scheme. But I
should be wrong. Wrong, that is. according
to the author of “Get-Rieli-Quick Walling-
ford,” who is the cleverest playwright in the
United States and the wealthiest. Says
Cohan: —-
I consider the play, as a whole, hone of the
players’ business. Their parts are their business—
and that’s all. If they hear the whole play read in
rehearsal they try to work it up in their own way ;
each has his own interpretation, and the result is a
crazy-quilt. I keep them in ignorance. Truly enough,
T can do little else with my plays, for not even when
I finish the first act do I know where they are going
to end.
Colmn's argument doesn’t seem convincing
to me, but he “gets there” every time with
his pr< ductions, so there must be something
in it.
“De Oriel”: The show was broke and the
co. hung dejectedly about the post-office
window. The manager was wiring for money.
“How do you spell unfinancial V” he asked.
“Well, it starts with U,” s..id the P.M.
“Acs, and it ends in 1,” concluded the
: ombre heavy. The comedian sadly agreed.
THE NEW GALLERY GIRL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The “house” is full of cotton thread
And odds and ends of rag,
For Mary of the golden head
Is on "a sewing jag.
The Belgian calls, the Red Cross cries,
Loud war on land and sea
Bids valiant womanhood arise
And wave her scissors free.
Somewhere the cannon thunder loud,
The steel points glance and shine,
And charging squadrons, cursing, proud,
Break through the foeman’s line ;
But shrill amid the sounds of fear
Across the battle's roar
Is heard the order sharp and clem :
“IIn! Needles to the fore!”
. Sufficient shells, sufficient buns,
Sufficient men behind
May drive the vanguard of the lluns
Like chaff before the wind ;
But linked with plan and valiant deed
Coes bandage, sock and bag,
And warring millions own the need
Of Mary’s sewing jag.
The month' drag on, the battle sways;
Not yet the German falls ;
Good blood for every vantage pays,
The long death-list appals;
But down the steel-edged tempest blown
The order comes once more:
“Ho ! Women stand behind your own !
And needles to the fore!”

IMPORTANT.
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. liough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
KIIDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

If Melbourne’s ancient anarchist, “Chum-
my” Fleming, isn’t careful he will get that
bath he has so often risked. The other Sun-
day he earnestly advised the Yarra-bank not
to enlist as “they could not be worse off
under German rule than they were at pre-
sent”—this while some were actually read-
ing the Bryce Commission report. The chief
trouble with Fleming is that, whereas his
‘sympathisers” keep their heads closed, he
hasn’t that discretion; consequently the
“law” he derides has had once more to rescue

Failed in the naek
Missed the head and gave
My finger’s a smack ;
I did groaneth and writh
For the pain it did throb
And out of pity the Missus
Did finish the job.

THE Overland possesses every
convenience that is possible to
provide. We not only plan, but
also make , practically every part of
the Overland car in the great Willys-
Overland factory.
The electric horn, magneto, electric
starter and electric lights are all
operated by merely pressing buttons
located on the steering post. This
requires no bending and no effort.
The speedometer and the instru-
ments are mounted in plain view on
the cowl dash board.
The Overland is very easy to drive.
It is strong, safe and wonderfully
smooth in travel. Although hung
low, it has exceptionally high road
clearance.
Inspection may be made at the
local showrooms.

COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS

I AM A WOMAN who belongs to a prematurely
grey haired family'. My father was grey before he
was 30, and two of my brothers as well as my sister
became grey early in life. Before the age of z 5 I
developed grey hairs, which became quite.embar-
rassing. to me-socially, and also in business. I
LOST THREE GOOD POSITIONS for no other reason
than my fading hair. The groyness increased with
alarming rapidity, and at :;8 i LOOKED LIKE A
WOMAN OF 45. One day I was seriously thinking
of buying one of the many Grey Hair Restorers
that are extensively advertised; when I casually
mentioned the subject to an acquaintance —a scien-
h
title man, and, as I after-
wards , learnt, a great
student of the Che-
mistry of the Hair.
He strongly ad-
vised me to have
nothing what-
ever to do with
these concoc-
tions. He poin-
ted out that
SUCH PREPAR-
ATIONS EVENT-
UALLY RUINED
THE HAIR, and
in the meantime
rarely deceived
even the casual
observer. He sug-
gested that I try a
formula that he had
perfect* d after a con-
siderable time, which,
by a certain chemical
action on the pigmentary colouring cells restored
the hair to its normal colour. In replv to my en-
quiries, he assured me that the formula was not
only absolutely harmless, but would develop A
STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL CROWTH OF HAIR. My
friend wrote out his prescription, which I had made
up, and after carefully following the instructions for
a few days, I was surprised and delighted to find my
hair becoming richer and darker in tone. The re-
colouring process continued until after some few
weeks my hair actually once again possessed the
natural shade of my girlish days. Since then I HAVE
3EEN INUNDATED WITH ENQUIRIES from friends
and also persons unknown to me, who came to hear
of this wonderful preparation. Having become con-
vinced that I have found A REMEDY OF EXTRA-
ORDINARY MERIT, and which is quite harmless, I
have resolved to offer it for sale, as I am certain
from my own experience that it will prove an ines-
timable boon to any man or woman who finds grey
hair to be the same serious handicap it was to me.
It is a Guaranteed Genuine Preparation, and I
OFFER A REWARD OF £lOO if it will not re-colour
Grey Hair to Original, Natural Shade.
If you are interested in this wonderful prepa-
ration I am willing to send you COMPLETE IN-
STRUCTIONS FREE
under plain sealed
cover. Simply write
your name and fuil ad-
FREE
dress plainly and enclose 2 stamps for postage, and I
will writo you by return pos 1 , or if convenient call.

SORE; THROAT AS A NOTIFIABLE DISEASE.
A neglected sore throat so often leads to serious
illness that the New York City Department of Health
has included sore, thr.oat amongst the notifiable in-
fectious diseases, all cases of which must be re-
ported by the attending physician. The best ciire for
sore throat is to suck a few Formamint tablets,
which, by the way, are also an excellent preventive
of all dangerous infectious diseases. Buy a bottle at

TO CURE COUGHS USE PINE TAR
AND SUGAR.
A SPECIALIST’S SUGGESTION.
Obstinate, tickling coughs, the kind that
racks you to pieces and keeps you awake at
night, can be instantly relieved and quickly
cured by 10 or 15 drops of bitrate of tar on
a lump Of sugar, and letting it slowly dis-
solve in the mouth. The specialist who
recommends this plan says it is superior to
anything he has ever tried, and may be used
with perfect safety and success on children
three or four years of age. To make an
excellent inexpensive cough syrup which
children like, he says there is nothing better
at any price than half a pound of granu-
lated sugar dissolved in half a pint of hot
water, and then stir in 2oz. of bitrate of
tar.. When cool pour into a pint bottle, and
it is ready for use. From half a teaspoonful
to a teaspoonful every hour or two will

IN
BANANA LAND `
The Printer has closed down on copy
from John Buchana.n, late sub-editor of the
Worker. It was a case of malignant con-
sumption. Born in Brisbane in ’B3,
Buchanan saw life out-back from the Texas
border to the Peninsula. Canefields, cattle-
and sheep-stations, lumber- and mining-
mmps all knew him, and the condition of
the toilers made him an earnest pleader for
the under-dog. Ultimately, he settled in
Brisbane, and entered the Railway Depart-
ment. His literary tendencies and strong
sympathy for Labor had brought him into
touch with the Worker, and he was offered
and accepted the sub.’s chair. At the
recent elections he unsuccessfully carried
Labor’s nomination for Nundah. That cam-
paign helped to hurry the end.
What “white men” do come in from the
Bush! One of the breed the other day
handed in two amounts of £lOO each to the
Patriotic Fund, then offered his body to
the authorities and went away into camp.
But he declined to offer the public his pame.
“That won’t make the money any more,”
was the only thing that could be got from
him.
J. H. Jones, M.A., a Brisbaneite at
present interned in Germany, says- that he
and his fellow-prisoners don’t waste their
time, by any means, but attend lectures,
mostly scientific, given by some of the
talented men among them. Culture (not
Kultur) is in fashion, he says, at the
concentration camps.
The officer just promoted to be Lieut.-
Colonel Brand is a Queenslander who has
made his way rapidly and deservedly. Brand
was brought up in Maryborough and
Bundaberg, and commenced to earn his bis-
cuit as a Queensland State school-teacher.
He abandoned the rod about a dozen years
ago and threw himself into military work,
but only got his first taste of actiYe service
in the present war. He won the D.S.O.
some three months back.
Driley” : Thursday Island Town Council
is developing a habit of appealing for exemp-
tion whenever a reform threatens to affect
the piebald interests. Some time ago it peti-
tioned the Government to wink at certain
local breaches of the Early Closing Act. The
idea was that if the storekeepers—mostly
Asiatics—were allowed to keep open till any
old hour, instead of closing at 6 p.m., the
council would gain a cheap light of sorts for
the streets from the shop windows. The
brilliant idea was, of course, turned down.
But the weird assembly soon conceived an-
other. This time it asks the Federal Parlia-
ment to exempt it from certain provisions of
the Navigation Act. It alleges that the en-
forcement of the Act will cause oversea
nigger-manned vessels carrying coastwise
passengers and cargo to change their habits
or get out, wherefore Thursday will be iso-
lated, and chaos will result. Naturally the
council doesn’t stress the point that Thurs-
day . has already a white-manned subsidised
service from the South, and it doesn’t even
hint that for a small increase in subsidy the
more frequent “white” service between Mel-
bourne and Cooktown could be extended to
Thirsty and, perhaps, Darwin. The institu-
tion of such a service is not the only alterna-
tive to the proposed drastic interference with
the Act, but something of the sort is what
the Far North,, with its eye on a White Aus-
tralia and national development, yearns for.
THE NEW TIPPLE.
Dr. Ingram, Bishop of London, said that young
and giddy girls, excited by so many khaki-clad men,
caused mischief in some of the camps.— Cable.
AGGIE: “ What's up, Gtert?”
GERT: “ ’S’all right, dear. I’m sobering up
on ’arf-an’-arf.”
Mayor Down, of Brisbane, comes along
with a lump of common sense. Seeing that
the Hospital is likely to be embarrassed this
year owing to the financial drains in other
directions, he turns down the annual “recep-
tion” and various other frivols, and instead
sends a cheque for £lOO to the leading
charity.
Before the Speaker is elected in the
Bananaland Assembly the Clerk of the House
takes the chair; but he is strictly forbidden
to speak, although it is his duty to indicate
which member is to “take the floor.” He
therefore points solemnly towards the mem-
ber who is td have the next say. Could
damfoolishness masquerading as business go
any further?
Another Queensland M.L.C. has had a
funeral. F. H. Hart was born in Madras,
but migrated to Sydney in 1843, took ' to
clerking in his youth, and became one of the
pillars of Gibbs, Bright and Co. Somehow
or other Hart later developed into vice-
chairman of the Queensland Marine Board,
though his qualifications for the post were
not conspicuous to the ordinary eye. For a
man born in Madras and living in the deadly
climate of Bananaland he did fairly well,
lasting out till his 80th year.
The Queensland Labor Government hadn’t
quite enough pluck to follow in full the
lead of the Federal Laborites and discard
the wig and robes of Mr. Speaker. McCor-
mack discarded the gorgeous lace collar, but
retained the gown.
On the whole, Ryan’s is a good, sound
programme of work, varying in quality and
usefulness after the customary manner.
More than half his proposals would pro-
bably be adopted straight off under a saner
Parliamentary system ; the remainder touch
points of public policy deserving of serious
discussion. There are, however, two weak-
nesses in the opening statement- —one as to
finance, the other as to the House of Dod-
der. These are no ordinary times, and at
no period has the problem of £ s. d. been so
pressingly important. The circumstances
of the hour are, moreover, exceptionally
favorable to a forward move against the
“Upper” House, not only on the ground that
it is an excrescence, but also because the
country is simply unable to support the
wretched thing any longer. It has been
stated that Ryan will postpone an attack
until the Council wrecks a vital Bill. This
is too thin. Its maintenance is a waste of
money; and if it is going to be allowed to
purchase a further lease of life by passing
Bills which Ryan may call vital, its exist-
ence becomes a more shrieking farce than
ever.
Queensland Government Printer Cumming
is in the seventh Heaven now. The Den-
ham Government used to block him when he
set out to compete with Private Enterprise.
The present crowd bids him go ahead, and
various Fatmen in the trade are so sad about
it that they are seriously thinking of volun-
teering for the Front.
Excellency Goold-Adams confessed, at a
missionary society meeting the other day,
that he had once been a policeman 1 in
S’Africa and then a Government Resident.
No telling to what giddy heights even a
“copper” may soar provided his brains are
not all in his feet!
Is Gladstone about to come into its own?
The lack of communication with its own
hinterland has been its curse ; but the town
is agitating now for a line to tap the Upper
Burnett country, which Maryborough and
Bundaberg look upon as their own preserve,
despite the fact that Gladstone has a fine
natural harbor, while the others have not
the slightest claim that way. -It is rumored
that Minister Adamson is friendly.
At last a good word has been said for the
prickly-pear devil. .Glengallan Shire ukased
that a farmer should destroy all prickly
pear on his place within a month. Hodge
replied promptly that he was feeding his
pigs and cattle on pear; that pear was the
only edible thing jeft by the drought on his
land; that he was not going to l destroy the
only plant that stood between him and star-
vation ; and that the Council could go to
Berlin. v
The Salv’army by the Sea.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Why should they make a background of the
sea,
That lifting voice of universal prayer?
Behind their futile lamp, a twisted tree
Shudders with tortured arms against the
flare!
Surely some shallow street would suit them
best,
Some soot-grimed lane, some sordid corner-
house,
With city lamp-posts waveringly confest;
Not the cathedral stars, nor winds’ carouse.
The blue Pacific rollers climb the shore,
As true believers to their Mecca come;
Surely ’twere well against this age-old roar
The puling of a newer creed were dumb?
With a perpetual penitence, a voice
Boasts of old sins and Light he found
to-day,
And makes the sign-post to eternal choice
Beside the mighty choiring of the bay !
A woman muffled in a threadbare coat
Sends out her tuneless quaver in a hymn;
A red shawl knotted round her wheezing
throat
Blazes response where the blown torch is
dim;
A pallid youth thumps time upon a drum,
Then , suddenly desists, and sullenly
Draws in a breath of grass and sand-sown
gum,
Conquered, and slavish to the conquering
sea!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, July 17, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Parliament was opened on Tuesday with
bowyanged Labor at the helm and a tinselled
Governor at the prow. Many ladies who in
past years appeared like Solomon in all his
feathers were conspicuous this time by that
which makes the heart grow fonder. There
are graver things than preening feathers at
fashionable functions these days. Lady
Goold-Adams wore silver-grey, embroidered
in silver and trimmed with fitch. Her hat
was of buttercup silk, lined with black.
Mrs. liyan was a cameo in grey; with
ruffles at her neck and wrists,, .and a demure
early-Vietorian hat of grey.
This has been a week of color. The
presence of the Papal Delegate occasioned
an outburst of green amongst the Irish
R.C.’s ; then, on the 12th, we had, of course,
an orange wave ; and, finally, there was our
own golden Wattle Day on Friday. While
I’m on the subject of R.C.’s and Prodestans
I may as well tell you that Archbishop
peretti left us for the South on Friday, and
that the Governor and her Ex. attended the
Orange, Pup’s concert on Monday. No
special significance is attached by official
circles to this succession of incidents.
The Archbish. during his stay here added
numerous trophies and addresses to those he
has acquired in Sydney and Melbourne. The
girls at All Hallows’ Convent gave him a
pair of silver candlesticks, and the boys of
the Gregory Terrace School passed him up
a desk. Qn Tuesday Archbishop Duhig
presented him with a river-picnic aboard the
elderly Lucinda, and on Wednesday the
Sisters of Mercy induced him to accept a
spare garden-party. His Ex. and Lady
Goold-Adams, Premier Ryan and his wife,
and Mayor and Mayoress Down were
conspicuous in the fold. On Tuesday his
Holiness’s proxy opened his first local
bazaar, and did it with neatness and despatch
while the customers waited.
The city was held up by the Wattle Day
Girls on Friday for the benefit of the
wounded soldiers’ fund. About £l2OO was
pirated. Which reminds me. Rose Day,
also, was so successful a rally for the Red
Cross purse that the hustling committee has
decided on a Sweet Pea day. This is
calendared for the last Saturday of Show
Week. The Gum Leaf family from the
country will know all about Ned Kelly’s
methods that day.
Lady Goold-Adaihs this afternoon opened
another Ladies’ Rifle Club at the South
Brisbane Technical College. The uniform
consists of khaki coats and skirts, with the
shoulder straps piped with red. If sounds more
attractive than it looks. Another rifle club
for the unexpected sex will shortly spring
into being. Mrs. Pendlebury is to be
president, and Miss May Gore captain.
Don’t ask me who’s to sharpen the horrid
bayonets, because it isn’t mentioned in
dispatches.
The Queensland Art Society has been
having its annual show. Little Agatha
Fitzgerald ha§ been receiving lots of praise
and encouragement for four book illustra-
tions, and Lloyd Rees, another young artist,
has been urged to keep going in the Interests
of Art. Harrison, of Melb. Argus, sent up
some good stuff, and Yida Lahey and Gwen
Stanley are represented by work which is
well up to their enviable average. The two
most striking pictures are by G. Grant, but,
unhappily, to hang them effectively one
would want a baronial hall. Nina Stodart.
whose work should make a name for her in
Australia, showed only one picture. Several
others shouldn’t have been allowed to show
half that number.
The Misses Troy, of Greymare, near
Warwick, were in Germany when, the war
began, and would have been there yet but
for the good offices of a certain Baroness
who conspired with the U.S. Ambassador
to deliver them. Among other things they
say that as late as March Germany had
abundance of food —Kriegsbrod (coarse
potato bread) was abundant, and milk and
butter were cheaner even in the war belt
than they are in Warwick. The, Deutschers
were then still confident of victory and
universally enthusiastic; and if, as some
assert, the country is on the verge of bank-
ruptcy it was disguising the fact with enor-
mous success.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
As explained in The Bulletin the other
day, Queensland never shows a big surplus,
because whatever surplus it has it must use
to pay off debt. Therefore it juggles its
accounts so as to have a surplus for appear-
ance sake, but never a large one. One plan
is to manipulate the money spent on wooden
buildings, particularly schools—and most
buildings in Queensland are wooden. If a
deficit threatens, all these buildings are
charged to loan. If there is a surplus,
enough of the cost is charged to revenue
account to absorb the money. Thus year
after year the accounts are faked, and sur-
pluses are manufactured to order.

NEPTUNE’S DAUGHTER has received the biggest

NEPTUNE’S DAUGHTER up to date has to its

Add to the above indisputable proof of the drawing
power of this wonderful film the fact that three

CHILDREN’S ILLS.
Thp first thing a mother should do when
her little one is feeling out of sorts is to
give a safe opening medicine. In nine cases
out of ten it is all' that is needed. A slight
obstruction in the bowels may cause an
alarming rise in temperature; a cold often
cofhes on with feverishness; and a little
over-indulgence, in good things will cause
biliousness. There is no better remedy for
the every day ills of children than Pinkettes
—the new laxative. Children like to take
them because they are small and dainty, and
will act freely without causing sickness and
griping. Send for a- free trial sample to the
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney, men-
tioning The Bulletin, or get a full-sized
shilling bottle from your dealer.*
SUPERSTITIONS ABOUT RHEUMATISM,
There is a good deal of superstition in re-
gard to the treatment of rheumatism.. There!
are shops where magic rheumatic rings be
purchased ; while some suffeneres are.,. con-
tent to carry some supposed charm in a i
pocket. ' : ' , ' • i
Superstitions in regard, to rheumatism pro-,
bably persist because there are many things
that are still unknown about the complaint
from a medical standpoint. The treatment of
it is still far from satisfactory. Doctors real-
ise this, .but nobody is more fully aware of
it than the sufferers themselves.
A tendency to rheumatism once estab-
lished, the pain often returns with every
change of weather, showing that the poison
is still in the blood awaiting favorable con-
ditions to become active and cause trouble.
One fact is known and acknowledged by all
medical writers, and that is'the rapid thin-
ning .of the blood when, the rheumatic poison
invades it. Building up the blood is. the
best remedy for rheumatism, as the enriched
blood is-'able to overcome or throw off the
poisons of the disease. For this reason rheu-
matic sufferers should be interested in the
success which Dr. Williams* Pink Pills have
had in the treatment of this painful disease.
They increase the blood supply and im-
and sufferers have proved that
through a course of them the system has
been enabled to throw off the rheumatic
poison. They have also noted that the com-
plaint did not return with the next damp
weather. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold
by all dealers. A useful booklet on “Dis-
eases of the Nervous System” will be sent
free to any address.*

Rubbed Until Quite Sore, Awful
to Look At. Kept Bonnet On to
Cover Horrible-Looking Patches.
CuticuraSoapand Ointment Cured.
Karitane. Prospect Station, Via Sale, Vic.
“Almost from his birth our baby, who is
just seven months old, had several patches
of eczema on the back of his head which
grew as he grew until at last the patches of
eczema were about three inches long and
about two inches wide. These gave baby
a terrible lot of worry; he used to rub and
rub his head on the pillow until his head
got quite sore.
“We were advised to try some ointment
of which we used a number of pots but re-
ceived very little relief from them. We
were told the head would heal when the
weather got cooler. Baby’s head was awful
to look at, in fact we used to keep a silk
bonnet on most of the day to cover these
horrible looking patches. We fortunately
saw an advertisement for Cuticura Rem-
edies in the paper and sent for samples of
the Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment
which wo used according to directions and
the result has been simply marvelous. We
then purchased some more Cuticura Soap
and Cuticura Ointment and in quite a short
time baby’s head had lost all traces of the
horrible eczema. He is now completely
cured and baby can get a decent rest now
as all the itchiness is all gone.” (Signed)

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
If our teeth could talk—they
would say something like this:
“Yes, we are thankful for our
friends —the millions of Tooth
Brushes. They do a splendid
work —so far as they go. We
are grateful for the hundreds of
dentifrices. They in turn do a
splendid work —so far as they go.
But both together fall far short of
protecting our enamel —our only
weapon of tooth protection. Is
there no escape from these
.‘MOUTH AClDS’—these ever-
present mouth fluids which, un-
seen, unhidden, are working day
and night to break down our
armor plate—and then make the
soft inside tooth structure easy
prey to decay-germs?”
We answer:
‘‘There IS escape from ‘Acid
Mouth.’ Pebeco Tooth Paste is
the one dentifrice to-day which
prevents ‘Acid Mouth’ —the direct
cause of 95 % of all tooth-decay.”

Pressmen were all fond of the late R.C.
Archbishop O’Reily, of Adelaide. A saintly
man in the Church, he was quite unconven-
tional in speech, and either an oration or
an interview always meant good copy. As
a pressman he had had his own troubles.
One came when, fresh from Ireland, lie
was editing the Recokd, the R.C. organ in
Perth. In his absence an assistant gave
to an article on Cardinal Moran a big head-
ing, “One of the Greatest Orators of the
Day.” Now Moran was so notoriously
poor a speaker that the remark looked like
sarcasm, and Father O’Reily had privately
to do some hard explaining, while publicly
he simply had to be a scapegoat and put
up with the ridicule.

Another abortive attempt has been made
under the N.S.W. law to compel a. news-
paper, which was being sued for libel, to
disgorge the name of the writer. Justice
Gordon came to the conclusion that Par-
liament’s object in providing for‘ the dis-
closure of a name was to give the person who
thought lie was damaged a second chance, in
case the paper itself wasn’t worth powder
and shot; and in this case, which arose at
Parramatta, it wasn’t suggested that the
owners couldn’t stand up to it.

“8.X.” : Bishop Cleary, of Auckland, who
is ill in Sydney, was the first jo'urnalist in
Maoriland to achieve the mitre. He was
editor of the Tablet in Dunedin before
going to tend the flock whom Dr. Lenilian’s
death had left without a shepherd. He was
at the time a member of the Maoriland
Institute of Journalists —or had been one,
at all events. No other member of the
society has been made even an archdeacon
since—which is not so much a reflection on
Cleary as on the arclidiaconate.

Fact outstrips imagination every time.
Years ago, during “Curly” Hutton’s regime,
when the throbbing question of the hour was
the usual addition to the uniforms of the De-
fence Force, The Bulletin published some
verses by “O. C. Cabot,” with the title of
“The Bombazine Artillery.” They are still
quoted in barracks —especially one line
which (clearly for purposes of rhyme)
stated that the much-bedizened corps was
“fit to defend a distillery.” The implied
compliment might have remained far-fetched
were it not for two striking incidents of the
war: (1) The British defence of the brewery
at Roulers, and (2) the French defence of
the great sugar-refinery and rum-distillery
at Souehez.
“McNorth”: This true story will serve to
illustrate the kind of thing the copy-hunters
who infest the South Sea Islands are liable
to run against. At (say) Kau-Kau, in the
Solomons, there lived a brawny, bewhisk-
ered trader named (say) Mac Hogan and his
three sons and one daughter. One night a
woman-novelist stayed at the Mac Hogan
ranch. About 8 o’clock, while the family
and their guest were at dinner, an unholy
assortment of yells, screams and shots broke
loose outside, and a spear whipped through
the open window. The ink-lady turned
pale and mingled cold perspiration with her
soup. The trader said, nonchalantly, to his
daughter: “Mary, didn’t I tell you before to
shut that window?” When the pandemonium
had lasted about a quarter of an hour,
Mac Hogan nodded to his sons, and the four
men took their rifles and went out. For a
few minutes afterwards the sounds of riot
increased tenfold. Then they gradually faded
away to utter silence, and the men returned
and placed their rifles in the rack without a
word. The novelist was by this time almost
speechless, but she managed to gasp:
“H-h-h-have they g-ggone?” “Well, no,
madam,” answered the hard-bitten old rogue.
“Y’see, they’re all dead,” This incident was
afterwards published in a Yankee magazine
as an illustration of the wonderful calm and
fortitude of the South Sea trader in time of
stress. But, then, that woman-writer didn’t
see Mac Hogan next morning paying the
harmless, peaceful niggers the tobacco he
had promised them for their part in the
entertainment.

Lloyd George presided at the 52nd anniver-
sary dinner of the Newspaper Press Fund in
London, and a collection taken up at the
close of his speech raised a handsome £3350
for the confidential relief of Inky Wayfarers
who have found the track too hard. Lloyd
George spoke chiefly on the war and the
functions of the press in relation thereto.
But he sandwiched in an appeal for the un-
fortunates—all the more hearty, no doubt,
because when he was “fairly hard up” him-
self he tried to make a living out of free-
lance journalism, and learned how uncertain
was the harvest at the best of times.
A PERSISTENT BEGGAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We did this, and we did that;
AVe have knocked the Kaiser flat.
He has been annihilated,
Broken, crushed, obliterated —
Suffered even the last woe
Journalistic swordsmen know.
Yes; there is no shade of doubt
That the foe is clean knocked-out
Overthrown in all directions,
Beat, full-circle and in sections;
Checked and stopped and countered neatly,
Smashed and pulverised completely !
With enormous loss defeated
To his stronghold’s he’s retreated
Where, when mutiny’s engendered,
Millions of him have surrendered,
Or—his eyes being opened wide
To his sinful, loathsome pride—
Has committed suicide.
As in our armchairs we sat,
We did this and we did that.
Proved, beyond all hesitation,
AA r e controlled the situation ;
Always saw our side advance,
Never gave the foe a chance;
Pictured him despairing, rioting;
But—and this is most disquieting
While the simple truth we’re writing,
While we’re warning, begging, slighting,
The enemy just keeps on fighting.

strenuous life, and always wish to be in fit condition; but bruises,

The Beggar’s Bowl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
grey beggars at the door—
Con McAlister made four.
What would yon small creature be,
Sitting by the stackyard tree?
Sure, my heart was mercy light;
Both my arms with meal were white.
Four grey men on weary feet
Blest me for the bite to eat.
Four grey beggars at the door —
Would they know my need was sore,
Wanting four gold pounds to pay
Land rent of the fields that day?
Up she came when they were gone,
Red the shawl that she bad on,
Ragged kirtle to the knee,
Greener than the sally tree.
Was she mother, maid or child?
Sure, her eyes were blue and wild,
And her hair-curls, white as wool,
Came no higher than the stool.
"Bless your roof-thatch, lady kind;
Cold the day and rough the wind —
Let me sit on yon small seat,
Lady tall, to warm my feet.”
11l I thought to speak her no.
In she came from frost and snow,
On the wooden creepy small
Sat her down in cap and shawl.
Bowl of warm milk on her knee,
Her blue eyes looked up to me:
“Hand that gives for kindness’ sake
Out of kindness’ lap must take.”
"Sure.” I laughed, “the cows are kind.
Small your need that I would mind,
Giving what your bowl will hold,
Bite and sup against the cold.”
Out she went when she was warm,
Bag of white meal on her arm —
‘‘Gold and corn be in your store,”
So she blest me at the door.
Baking cakes on red turf coal,
I forgot her empty bowl;
Sure my heart was listening sore
For a hard step at the door.
Shawn, my man, was far away,
And the land rent was to pay ;
Bough of voice and ill of look
Him that brought the quarter’s book.
Near my three blue rows of delf
Up I reached to touch the shelf.
Three white crowns I had to pay.
What the man would ask that day.
Och, ’twas ill to fret and frown!
Slow' I took the silver down :
Then I saw' —keep still, my soul! —
What was in the beggar’s bowl.
Four gold pounds and minted new—
Och. my heart, what will I do?
Will the kind hand gift of such
Curse me black at sight and touch?
Father Flaherty came in.
“Och. will it be soil or sin?”
Sure, he laughed my fear away :
“Let it soil the man you pay !”
Shawn came home. His purse urns full.
Warm we keep the creepy stool.
Always by the good turf blaze
Beggars sit on winter days.
Grey old men on weary feet,
Bless me for the bite to eat.
Hand that gives for kindness’ sake
Out of kindness’ lap will take.
N.S.W.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Good Friday and Epiphany.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Gabuna runs under rich black-soil
hanks half-hidden by the fan-palm and
the great-palm, with crowfoot elms
staggering on the summit, their roots
stripped from the earth by rain and become
partly aerial. On either side there are the
blues and greens of flowers and palms, and
the yellow flood far below driving its road
between. There are villages at every mile,
wherever there is solid ground for houses;
and thereby grow the bright red fruit of the
tart apple, the soaring shafts of the areca
and the cocoanut palm threshing in the wind,
waving its arms distractedly as if it were
Irish and had lost its father.
All that day the job of land-hunting had
been like any other day of land-bunting—■
villages with aerial nurseries of young cocoa-
nuts sore for the sprouting; villages with
pigs, dogs and black babies; naked brown
men making dugout canoesblue mud and
the slush of sago swamps; almost naked
black and brown women bruising the pith of
the palm in water and saving the grains of
sago ; struggling through slush and forest to
a sky-blue opening in the jungle; torn as
with fish-hooks by the flying buttresses of
the panda nus ; caught by the devilish thorns
of the lawyer-vine. When we left the stink-
ing mud of a sago swamp the boys plucked
little branches of sweet-scented verbena in
the jungle, carrying the branches aloft until
we were past the mud, and then fastening
the verbena in their string waistbelts so that
the smell of the mud wms beaten until we met
another swamp of sago.
It was while resting in late afternoon in
the village of Damain. -whose outer taro
gardens I had reached after a long climb on
a grade that seemed like one in one, that I
suddenly remembered the feeling of difference
of experience in that day, whose work had
been like that of many other days. I remem-
bered hearing a new song of the women as
they worked, at the divided sago txlinks
liquid enough in every syllable to be I apuan,
yet strangely familiar. But the Papuan
would make German sound like Italian or
Sienna and Russian like the Spanish of
Castile. He could not say “Chalmers, but
pronounced it “Tamate”; he cannot say
“Stephen,” so he makes it “Sisewa. And
now again I heard it. the lialf-spoken chant ot
llarada and Hanoi, and it hammered itself at
my memory for recognition, and. while recog-
nised, was strange as those nebulous memor-
ies of the things we knew in an earlier in-
carnation.
The small children making necklaces ot
abris seeds hummed it; the big. fat man who
lay on the platform of his house lazily
scratching a dog’s back with his splay foot
muttered it through closed teeth ; the women
beating the sago chanted it. grunting as they
dealt an unusually hard blow.
Ilola for frai am tamma
Yasa seenats tal —
They stopped at that, and a sago beater
began another theme :
Se ta lwras aloa;
That was spoken till they tired of it, and
then :—-
Bira sora avamara.
“I never heard it in any dialect of the
North or Eastern before,’’ said Hunter the
surveyor. “There they go again :
Ilola for frai am
Se ta heras aloa.
It’s got me.”
“What’s it all about? It isn’t of hunting
or courtship or war, and it’s brief enough to
be witty. I wonder if they’re singing a joke.”
“It means something. D’you know one
night I heard the people of the tree-houses
singing. I took a shorthand-note of it, and
got the strength of the noise next day. Let's
see. It goes this way : —-
Wona ! lana ! lana !
Namo! Namo!
Toatena mana ana
Tomut araran
Lopipo mar.
“And what does that mean?”
“Just plain poetry. ‘The song! The sun-
shine ! The deep sea ! Wisdom! Storm-
maker ! Giver of gifts ! Save our lives.’ ”
“It's fine! But what the Devil is ‘se i ta
heras aloa’?”
“It’s no good asking these people. Wait
till we get to Sorada —there’s a nig there —
a big man now ; owns two canoes, 20 pigs,
and the Lord knows what all. He went to
Sydney as a brand plucked from the burn-
ing, and some well-meaning old ladies gave
him money to save souls with. 1 think he
used it to save his own body when he came
back.”
“You can bet that with a certain type of
old woman a fuzzy-haired black boy is a
bigger catch for Heaven than a dozen white
kids in a city slum. Distant sinners are
always blackest, and what’s the good of
saving the innocent?”
“What’s the name of Julian, the Apostate
of Sorada?”
“I don’t know; Bawagasisi, if my mem-
ory's not dilly. Wait till you see him.
You’ll lose your curiosity about the chant of
the sago-beaters.”
* * * *
We found Sorada next day—a village on
the sea with a sago swamp near by for a
mosquito nursery, and Bawagasisi’s house
butted up to a great tree covered from soil to
summit bv a dark-blue, scented creeper whose
dower systems were shaped like birds in the
act of flight. A track led from his house to
the best garden of Sorada—Bawagasisi's.
Another track led to the beach and a great
canoe and two fishing boats —Bawagasisi’s.
Twelve pigs’ skulls and the jawbone of a man
hung in the house —Bawagasisi’s. A big old
woman cooked for Bawagasisi; two babies
hung in fishing mesh-nets in the smoke cur-
rents of the fire to escape the mosquitoes and
not escape the fate of a ham, and the smoked
babies were Bawagasisi’s—a fat aristocrat
with lime-bleaclied hair, and a cavernous
mouth showing as a patch of crimson velvet,
from its .staining of betelnut. His occupa-
tion was that so much beloved of men of sub-
stance in the Coral Sea —to lie on the house
platform and study sleepily the effect of
yellow sunlight on the yellow thatch of the
peaked long-houses, while scraping with a
large, sharp toe-nail the back of his favorite
pig, no lazier than its official scratcher and
owner.
Bawagasisi looked at Hunter lazily. Mem-
ory struggled with laziness in his sleepy eyes
for a minute, and then the expression of re-
cognition spread over his fat, black, glossy
face.
“AT. what name you?” he asked, and re-
plied to himself: “Better you stop one-time
longa big fella ship.”
“H’lo Bawagasisi! First time you stop
longa. mission—why you leave him?”
“Mission altogether finish long time.” re-
plied Bawagasisi. “You come! I <r e t
sipora.”
lie called to the woman within, and she
brought the limes he ordered, and as
we climbed the platform and loafed
on it Bawagasisi evicted the pig with
a sideways thrust of the foot. Grunt-
ing. it scrambled from the platform
and went under the house, irritability
shining in its wicked little eyes. The lady
who had brought the limes—a middle-aged
ugly and very fat woman, with the decency
of the grass rami discounted by the man’s
waistcoat she wore above it —looked at the
pig and then at us as if she preferred the
pig. and in that mood disappeared to the
house again.
Hunter’s pocket cup and his flask gave us
a drinking vessel and a corrective for the
crude acid of the limes, and we rejoined our
own men to make camp comfortable before
dusk, promising to formally visit Bawagasisi
later in the evening.
We had a dinner in a color scheme pf a
galah and the lien of a bower-bird—pink
and slate of taro and brown of roasted kan-
garoo and kingfisli: and the sun withdrew
himself in a hurry before the meal was fin-
ished. Hunter and 1. loafing each under his
net of cheese-cloth—for the ordinary mos-
quito-net was no protection—could dimly see
the babies smoke-drying in their nets, and

IF IT WERE BETTER KNOWN
that Backache, Dropsy, Rheumatism, Sediment, Dizziness and a Constant Sleepy
Feeling point to Kidney Disease, there would he fewer fatal cases than there are.
Thousands have kidney trouble and don’t
know it, because it comes on so quietly. To
all appearances the patient may be in good
health except for an occasional backache
and a heavy, drowsy feeling. But before
the disease is much further advanced there
are sharp, shooting pains in the loins and
back; the water is cloudy and gravelly; the
patient have to keep getting up in the
night to relieve the bladder, or there may be
distress in seeking relief, and partial stop-
page; then the limbs begin to swell with
water (dropsy), the heart seems affected,
the hands and feet are chilly; there may be
rheumatism or lumbago.
The only hope of successful treatment is
to commence before the kidneys become
seriously involved. A thorough course of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills should be
taken to relieve inflammation and conges-
tion of the kidneys, and to restore the natural
action of the kidneys and bladder. This
medicine acts quickly and directly upon the
kidneys, promoting a free flow, by which the
poisonous impurities are flushed out of the
system.

TWO LASTING SYDNEY CURES.
CROYDON
Mr. Chas. Merrill, Kyarra, David Street, Croy-
don, Sydney, says:—“For many years I was
employed in the ironworks at Eskbank, and I was
often put on filling the skips with coal. In this
work there is almost continual stooping, and after
a while I began to get nasty pains in the small of
my back. At first I thought they might be caused
by fatigue, but they continued and grew worse.
They troubled me also a good deal at night when
in bed, as if there was something hard gripping my
kidneys. Matters looked pretty serious, so I com-
menced trying different remedies, but I did not meet
with any success until I got Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. They have given me splendid relief;
I can now work with ease, and am quite free of
backache.”
Fourteen years later Mr. Merrill says
“Fourteen years is a long spell, but time has made
no difference in my cure. lam still absolutely
free of backache. That is a good record, and proves
that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a genuinely
good remedy.”
PETERSHAM
Mrs. Arnold. Eastfield, 16 Gordon Street,
Petersham, Sydney, says:—“For years I suffered
terribly from rheumatism, and was so bad that I
was completely crippled and had to use crutches to
get about. All my joints were numbed with the
constant pain, and I could get no proper rest day
or night. I was also troubled a lot with, severe
backache and other symptoms of kidney disorder,
such as bad headaches and irregular secretions.
No one knows what 1 went through, but my suffer-
ing is now a thing of the past, thanks to Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills. After trying all sorts of
kidney medicines without deriving any benefit 1
got this grand remedy, and twelve bottles completely
and permanently cured me. Relief came after
taking a couple of bottles, and. as I continued with
them the improvement was maintained, until finally
I was cured. I can now get about without crutches
or assistance, and feel a different woman. My
cure has been well tested, for nuite twelve years
have elapsed since it was effected, and I am still
well.”

further from the fire-glare the high-peaked
houses of bamboo and nipa hazing into one
wfith the impendent sky and the heavy violet
night. Suddenly the moon rose, and every
°ur in the village street barked at it; the
natives on the house platforms cursed them
to silence, and the singers began their perfect
harmonies of the happenings of the day.
“There’s the sea and the sun and the
color,” said Hunter, as the voices sounded
through the trees like a great organ.
Wona ! lana ! lana !
Namo t Namo l
They were silent for a moment at its end-
ing, and then from the house of Bawagasisi
and those in nearness thereto came the tune-
less chant of the sago women of Damani and
Haroi:—
Hola for frai am tamma.
“The damned thing is so familiar, some-
how,” said Hunter. “It annoys me to think
I can’t find it out.”
“Let’s ask Bawa —what’s his name?”
“Bawagasisi. Yes —but don’t ask him
direct.”
The choir of Bawagasisi had done its
worst when we had reached that potentate’s
house platform, although the children burst
into phrases of it at intervals.
Bawagasisi’s household strength of the
afternoon had been reinforced by four women
and a number of swan-black and copper-
brown children, in addition to the babies
who were still engaged in making hams of
themselves with smoke.
In other houses men passed the bau-bau —
the big bamboo pipe—from hand to hand ;
but Bawagasisi smoked a briar pipe with a
band of German silver on its stem. He was
a man of affairs and money; dogs’ skulls,
pigs’ skulls, men’s skulls in the house; pigs
in the sty below; dogs whining under the
platform ; a toia around his upper arm —a
great man of many wives. There was more
of patronage than of humility in his greeting
of us white men. He drew his trade tobacco
m the briar pipe and talked —an actor who
addressed the smaller part of his audience,
for his five wives sat behind him.
“How long you leave mission?” asked
Hunter with a very polite air of interest.
. “Plenty moon he stop,” replied Bawaga-
sisi. “Stop this feller way. I big feller boy
alonga mission. Byem bye mission take me
longa Sini.”
“You’ve been in Sydney, have you?”
“Two feller time Sini —big village that
one; more big this village. Sini no more
better village this one.”
“You see plenty white man longa Sini?”
“Plenty wdiite man—plenty feller white
Mary stop. Two old feller white Mary think
me been good boy—been likem plenty feller
hair longa me.”
He shook his fuzzy mop of hair in self-
ad miration.
“Old feller white Mary belonga church
down Sini?”
“He belong. Him been thinkem Bawaga-
sisi nice feller. I been singem prayer, sayem
cataclysm—then old feller white Mary been
say: ‘By Oise, this one boy bonzer feller.
Him been all right.’ Two old feller white
Mary likem me too much. That been first
time. Other feller time been askem me what
name I stop ; then him been tellem me more
better name Goofrita.”
“I see—Good Friday?” •
“AH right. Goofrita callem me. That one
feller belongem me—nice feller.”
He indicated the youngest of the wives,
and we nodded in recognition.
“Ole feller white Mary been callem that
one Pipany.”
“What’s that, Hunter?”
“Pipany! Pipany! Why Epiphany, of
course. Go on, Bawagasisi.”
“Then white Mary say: ‘Sposem you go
back you village been bringem boy longa
mission—savem all feller boy longa bissa.’ ”
“Bissa —what’s that?”
“Bishop, he means.”
“I see. He was to convert his own vil-
lage.”
“Yes.”
“Then I say: ‘Sposem give one pound
savem one feller boy?’ ”
“The cheek of it!”
“Then ole feller white Mary he say givem
ten pound savem ten feller boy. Other white
feller Mary say: ‘More better ! Savem all
that boy. Ten pound—ten feller boy go
longa Heaven—big feller save when sun he
come up.’ He been givem ten pound. Then
I come back my village—altogether leavem
mission.”
“Gettem ten pound, no savem boy?”
Bagawasisi yawned. “Savem girl. That
one ten pound I biyem trade —turkey-red,
jewarp, t’bacca; gettem cane, gettem house ;
gettem garden, plenty pig, two feller toia,
five feller wife.”
“Five feller too much.”
“No fear too much.”
“You say too much yabber longa mission;
then altogether too much yabber alonga
plenty feller wife.”
“No fear—one wife old-feller strong feller
diggin garden ; one quiet feller been chasem
wallaby; notlier feller good longa boat,
catchem plenty fish ; another feller —fat one
that one—big feller ugly that one, he been
cookem good feller.”
“And who’s the fifth —Epiphany?”
“Fippany that one; nice feller that one,
no been work.”
“So instead of saving ten boys he saved
five women, Hunter?”
“That’s it. When you know catechism
that time, you forget mission songs alto-
gether?”
“No. I teachem all this feller boy-—he
been sing cm all day; all wife belonga me —
singem all day; they been singem to-night
when sun he go down.”
“Not so well like you, Bawa.”
“No—me singem little feller altogether,”
assented Bawagasisi, accepting the flattery
as if he had earned it by achievement.
“You sing now, Bawa.”
“All right that one,” said the ex-bright
and shining light of the Associated Mission
to the Coral Sea. “All feller boy sing strong
feller —sposem not sing good feller I not like
you too much.”
They sang with some approach to a tune,
for Bawagasisi led them :
Ilola for frai am tamma
Yasa seenas tal,
Wayra anner batto eva
Bitha goa ewe wul.
“Got it at last,” said Hunter. “It’s plain
Moody and Sankey.”
“I know now. ‘Hold the fort, for I am
coming.’ ”
“That’s it —listen to Bawagasisi.”
The chant arose again.
Seta heras aloa.
“We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord,”
Then Bawagasisi spoke alone the cry par-
roted by the sago women of Haroi.
“Bira sora avamara,”
said Bawagasisi very solemnly.
“I can’t get that. What name that one
stop Bawagasisi?”
“Sposem all feller boy byembye go alonga
home, then that one missionary him been say
more better God no been leave him.”
“Ah! r ße with us all for evermore.’ ”
“That one all right—bira sora avamara.”
We went to sleep that night with the
mission songs and chants harmonised out of
easy recognition for a lullaby ; all that re-
mained to the ex-shining light of the Coral
Sea Mission of his experience when two
earnest old ladies of Sydney gave him ten
pounds to save ten souls of men—whereby he
saved five wives instead. For of such is the
kingdom of the Coral Sea proselyte. Bawaga-
sisi—the Julian, the Apostate of Gabuna
River-—improved on the teaching by
founding a Papuan Heaven here upon Earth
—when “Good Friday” married a gardener,
a fisherwoman, a huntress, a cook and
“Epiphany.”
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
A Rose of Heaven.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WHO had dwelt, as man counts time, a
year
Between the columns of God’s mighty
house,
Past that blue road where Saturn frets his
bond,
Never escaping from his closing ring—
I, who had felt an earth-tug at my heart,
Because of an old garden by the sea,
Took my smooth, downward flight amongst
the spheres.
But ere I went I plucked, for proof of
Heaven,
A rose of God’s own pleasance. Such a
rose!
As men may guess on earth —a-fine with
sweets,
Enough to scent an acreage of green,
Where the world’s roses are but embryo
Before the bearing of the perfect flower.
A broken marble faun that garden held,
A hedge of laurel, and a shaven lawn;
And cypresses reared black against a sea
That split the sandstone wall with silver-
greys
Beneath the pale thin lighting of a moon
Grown tired, and sloping to a misty shore
TtuU shouldered half the shallow gleaming
bay.
He, whom I loved before that year of Death
(I had not known it Death, but only Peace,
Until I fled God’s portals for an hour,
And set my cloud-chilled feet in homely w r ays,
Paths of dry grasses holding still the sun
And daisies, with Day’s grafting in their
hearts) —-
He whom I loved before that year of Death
Listened in that grey garden. By his side
Flattered the after-dinner butterfly—-
A soulless, random thing—against his knee,
A jewelled trifle for material hours;
Holding so little of him that his Bride,
Set this twelve-month in God’s white-pillared
house,
Could feel no stirrings of earth’s littleness,
No jealousy of that which springs to pass;
Made for decay like grass and flower and
tree.
Earth cumbers never soul; and even then,
As she leaned her slight weight against his
side,
He thought of me. His brown eyes sorrowful,
Although a smile for her was on his mouth,
As one might paint a curve upon a mask;
It could not climb as high as his dull eyes.
Yet as I passed them by he did not turn,
Still looking out to sea, where leapt a fish
Pallid as wintry sunlight on a wave.
But she grew rigid, took the cigarette
From the moist greed of her red, pouted lips,
Let it grow cold, and bent inquiring stare
At gems like fireflies on her round, bare
breasts.
“Did you not hear a woman’s rustling dress?
And see a shadow by the broken faun?
This garden is so old —it reeks of ghosts !
Surely you heard a step that crushed the
grass ?”
She asked, this motb of patchouli and paste.
His eyes still held their deadness, and his
hand
Played absently with her half-falling hairs,
As a man fingers paper that is blank,
Lazily musing what to write thereon.
“Nothing I heard, for I was pondering
On one who needs no gown for rustling.”
“But did you smell a rose? No rose indeed,
But a whole garden freed from Paradise,
Or eastern crocks of blossoms thrice-distilled,
Enough to stir the manhood in a monk.
Yet more like incense than a devil brew.”
Her slight, stained fingers dropped the cigar-
ette,
Eyes closed, her nostrils wide the drift to
catch,
Lusting, a new-sensation sensualist.
He shook his head. “I smell no rose,” said he,
“Like those she used to bring a year ago.”
She shrugged, and reached her hand to pour
the wine ;
It spit its yellow bubbles in the glass,
Twinkling a laugh against his sombreness.
“Phut! Would you make me rival of the
dead?
A limb of dust —against a ripe lip’s fire?
Perhans I dreamed the rustle of a gown,
Perhaps ’twas fancy, then, that God-like
rose ?”
He set his languid hand against the stem,
Turned the wide circle till it caught a star,
And held the reflex captive in the wine.
“Surely,” he answered wearily, “you dream!”
