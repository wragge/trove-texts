“ Big Flies.”
The Bulletin.
SATURDAY. AUGUST 21. 1886.
An old philosopher once said that laws are
like spiders’ webs: they catch little flies but
big flies break through them. Tha deci-
sion of the New South Wales Full Court in
the Coonan case would seem to bear out tae
truth of the proverb Whatever view the
legal profession may take of the Court’s deci-
sion, their Honors’ finding mustgive general
dissatisfaction to a wondering lay puolio. As
things are at present constituted members
of what with a fine and tel ing cynicism is
termed the “ lower ” branch of an out-
rageously privileged guild are in a position
to extensively bleed their Victims —we
mean clients—while keeping well within
the letter and even the practice ot
the law, and without descending to what is
conventionally regarded as actual dis-
honesty. But everyone knows that many
practitioners do pass this sacred Rubicon,
and through their knowledge of legal pro-
cedure and technicality, combined with that
astuteness for which the profession has been
ever famous, are (unhappily for the public)
in the great majority of instances able to
evade detection and baffle justice.
* * *
Under such conditions it is only reason-
able to expeot that when a ease of deliberate
fraud is clearly sheeted home to one of the
blaok sheep—we had almost said wolves—
of the legal profession, the punishment
meted out by those iu whose hands the
country places the administration of justice,
and to whom it has a right to look
for its purification, should be of suffi-
cient gravity to strike terror to the
hearts of like evil-doers, and that it
should be fir more severe than in oases of
ordinary fraud or robbery, where the thief
is unprotected by a hedge of privileges, and
the means of frustration or detection are
comparatively easy. But what do we find ?
A leading solicitor is accused of having ob-
tained money from his client under pretence
of having paid it to counsel for an opinion.
It is proved that he obtained the money
in person from this client and that he did
not get the opinion or pay counsel for it. If
this does not constitute “falsa pretences”
we would greatly like to know what does.
Last week a miserable butcher’s assistant
was sentenced by Judge Docker to the
monstrous punishment of ten years' penal
servitude for pocketing some small sums of
money paid him for his master. Yet these
are not parallel cases, inasmuch as the degree
of guilt and moral turpitude is tea times
greater in the case of the prosperous lawyer
and member of Parliament than in that of
the poor butcher's clerk. But then the
latter is only a “ Utile fly,” and therefore
the big punishment.

This is not all, nor is it even the worst.
Mr. Coosan, to back up his— well, his little
“monetary irregularity,” if he did not
actually perjure himself, went so close to it
that it would take a keen sophist to tell the
difference. He was handed the bill of costs
containing the fraudulent item. He looked at
it and swore that it had been made out by a
clerk who had left his service, and that the
Challenged item was taken from an entry in
his book, wnereas he has since admitted that
the document is in his own handwriting,
that it was made out by himself, and that no
such entry appears in any of his books. All
this the Chief Justice of New South Wales
oalls “ most improper conduct ”1! I and sen-
tences the distinguished culprit, not to ten
years’ penal servitude—oh, no, Lawyer
Uoonan is a “ big fly ’’—not even to be struck
off the rolls—but, forsooth, to be suspended
from practising his profession for six months
—just long enough to allow the ingenuous
Coonav to take a trip to England and be
presented to the Prince of Wales along with
other “ representative Australians.”
t * • »
Great as must be the surprise at the absurd
inadequacy of the sentence passed by the
Judges, it is as nothing compared with the
wonderful logic by which the sentence was
arrived at. When delivering the decision
of the Court, Chief Justice Martin said
“ If we could see that he made this charge with
the view simply to obtain the money we should
have allowed the matter to go to another tribunal,
or we should strike him off the rolls; but we do
not propose to take either of these courses, for it
seems to be exceedingly likely that having made
SARA BERNHARDT.
the statement about having taken counsel’s ad-
vice he put these Items in his hill of costs for the
purpose of cloaking his nevlect to file the proper
pleas and to bear out what he had told his client.”
According, then, to the highest judicial
tribunal in the happy oniony of New Soutn
Wales, the fact of a robbery having been
committed to bear out a lie Is an extenuat-
ing circumstance and of sufficient merit to
prevent the matter from going to “ another
tribunal,” or, in other words, to save the
guilty party the unpleasantness of a life-long
penalty. This will strike the lay mind
as something quite new and worth remem-
bering. We should advise the nextsporting
bank-teller who is compelled to face the
spikes at the Central Criminal Court for
haying a deficiency in his cash to plead that
• ving told his friends he was a heavy win-
ner at the last race meeting it was necessary
he should have the money “to bear out
what he had told them -or we may have
an intelligent burglar asking to be excused
from his five years of “ skilly ” on the
ground that having told his pal he had
cracked that little crib, he was compelled to
do it “ to bear out what he had told him.”
♦ ♦ *
The action of the Full Court In finding
Coon an guilty, and still allowing his name
to remain on the rolls, amounts to this: that
a man who, to cover his own culpable
neglect, tells his client that he aeted on the
advice of an eminent oouasel and charges
for that counsel’s opinion without going to
the trouble of obtaining it, and finally swears
in court that a bill of costs in his own hand-
writing was drawn by another man, is a fit
and proper person to practise as a Solicitor
of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
There is, of course, one possible excuse for
the lenity of their Honor* in this ease, but
it is not flattering to the profession* viz.,
that they recognised in Mr. Coonan’s action
the “custom of the trade.” If this be so,
we fear there was dire necessity for the Act
of Parliament which “made solicitors gen-
tlemen,” and that there is low equal urgency
for another act to wipe the guild off the
face of the earth.
The Imperial Pederation Lie.
When Lord Tennyson, in his official capacity as
poetic dancing skeleton to the Royal Family,
wrote his famous ode on the opening of the
Colonial and Indian Exhibition, ho gave the cause
of Imperial Federation a lift for which Its advo-
cates have every reason to be thankful. The
poet and the politician both work on the same
theory—that Federation will weld all the subjects
of the British Crown into one invincible nation,
and they both avail themselves of a poetic license
—a euphonious term for a poetic lie—in placing
this view of the case before their converts. Un*
fortunately, however, a little reason and com
mon-sense show clearly that federation mus
either remain woefully incomplete or must
utterly overthrow the Anglo Saxon supremacy
over one-seventh of the habitable globe. The plo*
ture placed before us is that of a Federal Parlia-
ment reoresenting and governing a population of
about 310.000,000 souls, but it is commonly for-
gotten that of this number nearly 260,000,000 are
Asiatics who are not yet allowed even to
govern themselves. If the native races of
India be excluded from the league the
supreme Legislature will only represent one-
sixth of the Empire at the utmost; if they are
admitted they will vote down all the rest of the
mongrel federated nation and rule Britain, Canada
and Australia by force of numbers. As it happens,
however, they are but little inclined to submit to
the gross injustice of exclusion. The great silent
movement in favour of Constitutional Govern-
ment is still progressing and gaining strength
among the Hindoo tribes; sooner or later a native
Parliament must be granted, and that body will
ultimately demand to be represented in the
Federal Council, should such an institution ever
by any evil fortune be created. The Oriental races
have long since discovered that “ Jan BOOL ” is
not a potent Feringhee deity as they once sup-
posed, but a peaceful, tow-headed citizen, whose
claims to rule over them are based chiefly on
treachery, lying, and good luck, and they are not
inclined to submit to his domination so peacefully
as of old. It is now nearly 140 years since the first
British conqueror proceeded to hang up his Aryan
bat in the tents of Shem, and though the welcome
of Shem himself was warm rather than courteous,
things have gone well with the conquerors ever
since. But now a confusion of tongues worse
than that heard of old in the plains of Shinaft
is heard demanding Constitutional Government
and should it be refused trouble may arise. The
establishment of a Federal Council from which be
is excluded will mean to the Hindoo that, instead
of being oppressed by Britain alone, he will be
weighed down by-all the British Empire outside of
India. Either the dominant race must face the
chance of an insurrection—not merely on the part
of the army as before, but a rising of the whole
nation—or else they must be content to see the
Hon. Shikkamy Shasteb, of Madras, or SnoiiAßi
Shoppurji, from some ten-syllable Jungle town-
ship, running the whole Imperial machine in Lon-
don, with a yellow-dog coloured Cabinet and a
brown Semitic majority at his back. And if there
is any meaning whatever in the talk about the
“ Federation of the Empire,” this is what the
disciples of the new order of things already look
forward to. Everyone has heard of the coming
millennium when 300,000,C00 souls are to be joined in
one league, and it is impossible to suppose
that the men who rave of this deliber-
ately mean all the while to leave 260,000,000
of these out; but net one federal apostle
has yet had the honesty to point out that
a white population of 40,000,000 cannot rule almost
seven times their number of Asiatics by their
votes alone. The Hong-Kong Chinaman, the Cape
Hottentot, and the civilised portion of the
Canadian Indians must also be represented on the
same basis, and unless federation is a lie and a de-
lusion a time may come when “ Spotted Tail ”
from the Saskatchewan will form a Ministry In
England, and Mr. Gladstone will go into the
division lobby along with a man who smokes
opium and plays fan-tan in the Commons’ card-
room, and with another who bangs an assegai
against a bull-hide shield by way of applause in
an exciting debate. In these happy days of the
future t e British representatives may congratu-
late themseives when they succeed in carrying a
resolution by coalescing »ith discontented Mos-
lems and Malays, African K.C M.G. s, and Obi men
from Barbadoes and Jamaica, aad a fierce discus-
sion in toe supreme legislature of the
Empire will be interspersed with strange
federal oaths in Tamil and Gujarati dia-
lects, mixed with recriminations from Chuno
Eat, the ennobled Chinese washerman irvm
the Par East. And on the other hand, if none of
these things are to come to pass, toe Empire will
not be federated after all, tbe boosted union of
300,000,000 British subjects will vanlsa into thin air,
auo ino n ague of brotherhood will be merely a
combination of tbe dominant race, to enable tbem
the more effectually to keep in subjection an
enormous population, which is already demanding
to be freed from its servitude. There are only
two alternatives to this great question—either
federation is a stupendous lie, or it Involves tae
total ruin of Anglo-Saxon supremacy in tbe
British dominions.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
“The Chinese Must Go.”
The Bulletin indictment of the Chinese appears
in this week’s Issue, From that account it will be
gathered that Mongolian immigrants are a
heterogenous element in the population of Aus-
tralia. For the purposes of money-making, or im-
morality, they come Into contact with Australians,
but In all other respects they are Isolated units,
having no cohesion save to members of their own
race. They constitute an autonomous band inde-
pendent of Australian law, as they are regardless
of Australian custom. “ Manners they have none,
and their habits are disgusting.” Their trade, cus-
toms, and practices are repugnant to local law, yet
the law Is powerless to prevent what it clearly
forbids. The #>alnatnan has been weighed in the
balance and found very much wanting When he
is simply vicious, his vice is destructive; when
criminal, a menace to the State; and when indus-
trious, he threatens revolution of the social
system. The majority of Chinese coming to Aus-
tralia are simply and literally slaves, acting under
control of the central authority. When the Mongol*
therefore, competes In the labour market by
cabbage-growing, furniture-making, or what
not, the result of his Industry is to degrade
Australian labour by bringing It down to the
level of slavery. Even when not a slave, the labour
of the Chinaman Is a curse to the State generally,
for he, knowing nothing of the comforts of civili-
sation, Is willing to give his toil for the mere price
of existence—an existence shorn of all graces as ot
all usefulness to the community. Give a Chinese
labourer a three-roomed house to himself, and a
wife to himself, and he will be found unable to
maintain the one or support the other by any
honest labour. In Sydney there are some Chinese,
other than the proprietors of stores-stores often
tun by the slave-labour of their own countrymen—
Who do support a wife and family in comfort, if not
to luxury. One estimable gentleman of this class is
known to most of the police as a professional
burglar; he does not pretend to any other trade,
but manages this one so deftly that he has never
yet been convicted, although following this same
Industry for years. One or two others are equally
Well-known smugglers: they do nothing else, yet
they are seldom caught, and when they are the
fine is merely a charge on subsequent successful
operations. Such men, and the storekeepers and
gamblers, are the only ones who can spend any-
thing on their homes, and even the latter class, the
merchants, are, taken all round, a curse to the con-
tinent, for no reasonable citizen wishes to see shop-
men enslaved. There would be leas danger of evil
from the existence of Chinese in our midst if people
were aware of the mode of life which obtains
With these aliens. But purchasers of their
and other wares are not, or else they probably
Would not buy as they now do, The extension of
Mongol power and Mongol vice Is merely a ques-
tion of time under present conditions. Every
day the octopus remains only adds to the
difficulty of his final ejection. It has
been so in America ; ’Frisco, with her
colony of 70,000 Chinese has at lest decided that
absolute expulsion is the only remedy. "The
Chinese must go! ” is her motto, and that decision
must be adopted by Australia. The Alien Act
must be at once repealed to prevent the Chinese
from acquiring freeholds: known gamblers, burg-
lars, smugglers, and other criminals must be made
to show whether they have lawful means of sup-
port; the European girls must be torn from the
grasp of their present debaeers; a law must be
passed to prevent men from packing together, like
sardines, in th ir dwelling houses; and if these
things are done, though Chinamen will not be
absolutely ejected from Australia, they will at
least find It not worth while to remain. “The
Chinese must go I ” Let this once be resolved, and
the means of their expulsion will easily be found.

Soft Staff.
6t. Thomas’ Anglican Church at North Shore,
Sydney, Is one of the finest specimens of Gothlo
architecture in the colony, and Is not yet paid for.
Desperate efforts have been made to build and to
pay for St. Thomas’. Ye Olde Hngllsho Payre of
four years ago was chiefly in the interest of St,
Thomas’. The dames and damsels of the show at
that time, it will be remembered, earned a noto-
riety almost as enviable as that of the most for-
ward personages of the Prlmross League, and
since, St. THOMAS’ hat, variously bedizened,
has been a very familiar object to all chari-
tably disposed. Still the debt hangs, and awk-
wardly—the contractor has a claim on the fabric,
and we are told by St. Thomas’ Kalendab that
some effort must be made to clear that claim.
The sheep and the lambs of St. Thomas’, however,
do not excel In making financial effort. It is esti-
mated that if the week he so fine as to fairly bring
In spring with next Sunday there will be £lO,OOO
worth of new millinery in the pews of the church,
and it is known that there will also be about 50a
worth of silver coin on the plate. The shepherd
of St. Thomas’ can’t use the shears worth a cent,
or otherwise there la some mange of meanness or
constitutional disability to give freely In the
flock. What does he feed them with ? Here is a
quotation from his Kalbndar, a sort of monthly
pastoral:—
"Readers of the Kalbndar will no doubt be
thankful to have had satisfactorily explained in
the last Issue the phenomenal rains which have
fallen since the 15th of July. Do they prove be-
yond question that the good St. d within has well
earned his claim to be associated with the weathe r
at this season ? It is really delightful to find this
Is just as true in the New World as in the Old. It
is almost tike the discovery of another link of
union between the Mother Country and her
daughter.'
Is that likely to produce wool ? How do the hard-
headed, practical men who, Mth cudes and dolts,
sit In the pews and stick to the o-uroh, stomach
and digest such stuff as that ? Sr. Swithin—the
old fellow who used to christen the apples for
English schoolboys—is somehow, m the mind of
the Kalendab editor, associated with the open
windows of heaven, and the cracked crust of Aus-
tralia drinking its fill and putting on its amazing
food crop. The good St. S within is asso-
ciated with it. So is the good parson, doubt-
less. And in about an equal degree. But
where Is the “practical commonsense bishop ?”
Can’t he afford time to run up by cable tram to this
high church and say, “Fancy Payre I can abide,
and to daughters of Moab I do not object, and
your Saint’s hat at every corner may be tolerated,
but if you want St Swithun. and In this fashion,
I must object ?” Is it not fittingly called "Soft
Stuff,” this doctrine of the Kalbndar ? Is it pos-
sible to imagine it as set forth earnestly by a
reasonable man to reasonable men ? St. Swithin
is associated with the rain, yes, and doubtless if
some poor wretch of a woman of the parish, with
husband in gaol and children Blok, should heg at
the door of the sanctuary, another saint would be
recommended to associate himself with her (any
saint but Saint Sovereign), but why isn’t the
blessed St. Thomas stirred up to associate himself
with the church debt? Thomas always was slow
since his name was Didymus. He won’t move till
the bailiffs are in, and even the “ daughters of
Moab” fall to put them out.
♦
Where are the Rest ?
“ If they are going to suspend Coonan, they might
as well suspend us all,” said an Indignant little
lawyer in Sydney last week, and he was Just
about right. The public will blame Mr. Coonan
because he sinned, the legal profession will hate
him because he allowed himself to be found out.
Sympathy would be wasted on Mr. Coonan. We
believe he richly earned every ounce of the
punishment meted out to him. It is right that he
should suffer; the only matter for regret is that he
should suffer alone. To suppose that he is the
only sinner is absurd, and the attitude of some of
his brother lawyers who hold up one hand in
pious horror, is, to say the least of it, hypocritical
in the extreme. We say hold up one baud, for a
man cannot hold up both while one is in a client’s
pocket. Coonan, attorney and member of Par-
liament, Is punished because he charged a client
for services never performed, hut he has enough
companions in such conduct to fill the Court from
which he has been temporarily excluded. Not one
hill of costa in ten escapes deductions in taxation;
instances have been known wherein taxed costs
have been less than 50 per cent, of the original
total; items are frequently reduced to 10 per cent,
ot their original amount, and often enough dis-
allowed altogether. In these cases the lawyers are
either unjustly deprived of their lawful remunera-
tion, or else they have put in such items on the
“ off-chance ” of getting them paid, and the chance
has not come off. And, as the lawyers seem to
flourish in spite of these huge reductions, it may
be assumed that selling off their forensic goods at
less than the alleged cost price is really very good
business. Nor are matters much better in the
“nobler” branch of the profession. If there Is
any barrister who has not taken money for ser-
vices he did not perform the probability Is that he
hag a very small practice indeed. Even of the
Judges who eat in j udgment on the erring Coonan
there may even have been one or two wno had
accepted briefs, pocketed fat fees, and then left
some unskilful Junior to conduct the case as
best he could. These things are done every term
by some of the leading barristers, yet the censors
of the profession do not search for the extenu-
ating falsehood, which, in the opinion of Chief
Justice Martin, appears to be a mitigation of such
offence, and the member of the “nobler ” branch
of the profession is not even called upon to explain
his financial eccentricity. “ Engaged in another
court, your Honor,” is deemed complete condon-
ation of the act of calmly pocketing a client’s
money, and leaving that client defenceless, to be
gobbled up by the legal wolves of the other side.
The Insolvent who "fraudulently” favours one
creditor at the expense of another is sent to gaol;
tne barrister who fraudulently prefers one client
to another grows sleek and fat, and flourishes like
a green bay tree in the sunlight of Judicial smiles.
The New South Wales Judges may, In their barris-
terial days, have be n without sin, and they may,
tnerefore, now be able to oast the first stone at
Mr Coonan. but there are very few others of his
brother practitioners who can Justly Join in his
condemnation. Coonan has been punished, but
where are the rest of them ?
*
The Grime of Good Character.
Judge Docker has descended to explanation. He
asserts that under the New South Wales Criminal
Law he is a mere machine for registering sentences
which the people have imposed. This is an initial
mistake. The people did not draw up the New
South Wales Criminal Code. Its authors are men
who have compiled it in the light of the executive
savagery which shed a lurid glow over young Aus-
tralia. And it is a lawyer-made code. No lawyer can
free himself from the manacles of his profession;
it is not the good of society which he regards so
much as the traditions of a profession that looks
upon all accused persons as felons, and regards
every criminal as a hopeless ruffian. But even
under a Steptaenesque code. Judge Docker has
a large amount of latitude. In Berner’s case,
noticed last week. Judge Docker does not deny
that he had the power to award a three-
year penalty if extenuating circumstances
had been found. The Jury discovered such cir-
cumstances, for they recommended mercy,
but the full penalty was given in spite
of Berner’s previous and unimpeachable re-
cord. The secret of this Judicial severity is
found in Judge Docker’s address in the case of
Alger Buntabd, convicted last week of having
embezzled various small sums from his employer.
Previous prosecution of the same prisoner before
Judge Dowling had resulted in a verdict of “ not
guilty,” the evidence being insufficient to convict
upon. But in this instance the Jury did convict,
and Judge Docker, alter nearing evidence of pre-
vious good caaraoier, said “he would remark, noe
for all, that its bis opinion, there were casas where
previous good character was aa aggravation of
the offence—such cas Bas the present.’ From this
we naturally conclude that if Buntabd had mur-
dered several of his female relatives, embezz ed
from two or three banks, and flued In ois youiafui
days with a little buahranging and burglary, his
previous bad character ryould have mitigated his
offence. With much humiti y we would like to
a s k this Judge how much < f Buntabd s sentence
was awarded for this defalcation, and how much
for the previous good character which aggravated
the crime! It, simply comes to this: that the
better the previous record of an embezzler is the
less likely he is to get a reduced sentence. Which
is very good news indeed for habitual criminals, I;
CORRESPONDENCE
I Corretpondentt who owe nett/ier name nor nom-de-
pUme cannot expect to have their com-
munication* noticed .l
“ A. 8.” (Moubray) : Thanks for the cut-
tings which, though “ ancient,” as you say, are as
uninteresting as many other ancient things....
Wooloomln): Your idea, unfortunately,
suggests no picture. Shall be glad to help you in
any other way “T. 8,” (Launceston): Thanks.
J.J.”: Thanks. Politeness, however, isn’t
everything in this world. Man is like a lot of
other things which, the more polished they are,
the more slippery they become “Hater of
Snobs”: Much obliged “Lunatic”: Thanks. It
is true that we don’t enquire concerning the
moral character of all those who write for The
Bulletin. For one thing, we haven’t time;
another reason is that if we gave too much en-
couragement to writers producing certificates of
character signed by the clergy, the paper would
“go bung,” and we’d have our humble Waterbury
watch stolen too of ten.... “J. Thornley” (Bris-
bane): One scientist has described the animates
“a fat beast without any brains,” but that might
lead to confusion between a hog and a member of
Parliament. Our own impression is, however, that
a man who has got his three sons into Government
offices and then stumps the country with a view to
getting a billet for the baby as soon as It grows up,
about fills the bill—all except the bacon.. .“Jos.
Talt” (Balmain): It is always very difficult to
translate an English name into any Oriental lan-
guage. Neild’s name in Arabic, as far as we can
make out, would be E; Jawbone Abdulgizzardbosh,
or bosh to that effect. This, of course, is only
a free translation. To render it verbatim, would
break an Arab’s teeth, and he would be compelled
to gum Arabic for the rest of his life
“ W.G.”: He may be technically qualified, but we
don’t advise you to consult him—"Subscriber’*
(Newcastle); (1.) We don’t know where she now
lives. (2.) The “ doctor” named and the individual
you mention, referred to la our narrative, are
identical...." Lyra”: You have surely spelt the
name wrongly. Douglas Sladen, like you, wrote
things he called verses, but he has gone to Eng-
land. Why don’t you go there too ?....“ Inves-
tor.” We know nothing of the land you mention,
but habitually cherish a nasty suspicion concern-
ing subdivisions largely advertised In the country

stance that sons-ln-law of N.SW. judges are
always singularly clever fellows, and wonderfully
successful in at least the legal profession. We
suppose it is that a Judge will not let his female
relatives marry lawyers or barristers unless the
l atter are forensic geniuses. Sometimes the genius
has been observed to lean in the direction of em-
bezzlement “Progress (Orange): Will deal
with your letter at first opportunity....“ Sub-
scriber” (Richmond, Vic): Will at an early date
print your letter and give Information asked
for ...“Spec.”: The point of your story seems
somehow to have been left out. Next time you
write, kindly send along the point and leave out
the story “A Contributor” (Tumut): The
chances are that Guodagal and Tumut will both
be the richer for the railway. The former hole—
we mean town—cannot remain a terminus for
ever. ...“0.J.T.” (Bombala); Oar opinion is that
half the “blow” about the alleged Kimberley
goldfield in the daily papers consists of local store-
keepers’ mendacities; the balance is made up of
lies in the interests of steamship companies and
of runholders who want a market for their stock.
Stay where you are..,.“Coke ’’(Redfern): The
suspension of Mr. Coonan from the practice of
hisj profession does not necessarily involve his
expulsion from the N.B. W. Assembly. A majority
c uld certainly expel him, but they have equal
power to expel anyone else. Tne House might
even effect the expulsion of the saints who have
oceans of sanctity but can’t get their certificates
from the Court of Insolvency....“J.R.W.”: No-
oody can chaff Parkes so effectively as Mr.
Dailey. Sir Patrick Jennings’ speech at Dubbo,
which bore evidences of having been inspired by
the Right Hon. Plain Bill, was so neat and so
telling that it quite “ narked ” the D.T
“Reader” (Charlestown): If Miss Edith O'Gorman
really said, as reported, that " the Sisters of Charity
were not the doers of the good deeds ascribed to
them,” she deliberately said what she knew, or
ought to have known, to he utterly untrue. Any-
one who wants to know what the Sisters of Charity
(whether R.C. or Protestant) are, has only to
enquire from the colonel of any regiment, the
captain of any man-of-war, the superintendent of
any hospital, or the governor of any gaol. It no
doubt pays Miss Edith O’Gorman very well to dis-
credit the Sisters of Mercy, who are the best and
bravest of women, and are none the worse for the
fact that they don’t perambulate the country
raking in gold for their own purses and sowing
the seeds of sectarian bitterness. The matter of
Miss Edith O’Gorman’s lectures is, we have heard,
free from any gross indecency, but we have no
hesitation in saying that Miss O’Gorman would
have very scanty audiences indeed but for the ex-
pectation entertained by those who pay to
dear her, of interesting “ revelations.”
' Quipolly ”: Time enough after defendants’ trial.
... “A Lover of Fair Play We quite agree with
all you say -but we’ll take no risk n such matters

published for an unworthy motive i.e., for merely
“sensational” purposes— a narrative concerning
the early life of a man who, although he once parti-
cipated in an infamy, had since shown himself cap-
able of better things, and had now been permitted
by society to attain a good position. Our object in
publishing the narrative was to enable the public
to form a correct opinion as to the expediency of
releasing a notorious criminal....** James Fahey”:

A Eushman’s Troubles.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
’Tis the voice of the ’possum, his tones sweet’and
low
Assure me he means for my damper to go.
Hark J he’s close to the fire -he searches the pot,
Ha, ha! hear him swear (in pure ’possum), “d—d
hot!”
Now, he upsets the plates, in a rummage for
crumbs—
He has finished; by Jove, here my enemy comes!
tie frisks round the tent. Now, along the ridge-
pole
He is trying in vain to discover a bole-
ro eager is he to partake of my store
That be musters up courage end comoa to the
door.
There he sits, while I lie, vainly trying to stamp
On my brain, by the aid of a Airing slush-lamp,
Some grains of the wisdom and humour witnin
The pages that make uo the week's Bulletin,
Now he cautiously creeps, and bright visions of
loot
Prevent him observing my iron-heel’d boot.
It is pr ised. Now, I think I have focussed him
straight—
Ph w! bang! but my tent lifting foe doesn’t
wait.
For I hear him above, on the limb of a tree,
And those angry remarks are meant clearly for
me,
And that musical sound, ’twlxt a growl and a hiss,
Conveys to me plainly—he laughs at my miss.

Political
Points
AUSTRALIANA.
Ninian Melville, M.L.A., is pretty often
greeted at political meetings with “ How about
that £35 ?”
Vanity Fair predicts that Parnell’s ex-
tinction will follow on Gladstone’s. Perhaps, but
Gladstone is not yet extinct.
“ Mr. Chamberlain,” says Lord Wolverton,
"is worse than Judas Iscariot in that he has be-
trayed not his master but his Maker.”
Dan. O’Connor, Im Pay for West Sydney,
Isgoing to protect native Industries. That’s good.
But who Is going to protect Dan. O’Connor ?
The Sydney Globe politely describes the
g.M Herald as "the venal paper which stands
with one arm around the neck of the Importer,
and the other affectionately embracing the land-
grabber.”
Mr. J. P. Abbott, M.L.A., who is looked
upon as tbe coming leader of the N.B.W. Protec-
tionist party, will make his debut before a Protec-
tionist audience by taking the cnalr on Friday
night, August 30, at the lecture to be given In
Sydney Protestant Hall by Mr. L. F Heydon,
M. on " Tne Progress of Protection In
N.
One Richard Pigott, erstwhile editor of
the Flag oe Ireland, an extreme Dublin
Nationalist organ, is said to have concocted the
bogus Fenian manifesto published in the Times
on the eve of the late British general election.
Pigott figured several years ago (with Lady
Florence Dixie) in the concoction of several
"Fenian outrage ” yarns.
Messrs. Abigail and Hawthorne, Ms.L.A.,
shining lights of Orangemen and lemonade, have
visited Milong, and been entertained at Toohey’s
Hotel, but the report doesn’t say what they drank
on the licensed premises. We are also told th«t
" both gentlemen visited the public school and
addressed the pupils.” We hope that little Abigail
didn’t address the pupils on the rules of orthogra-
phy or syntax.
This most hopeful and satisfactory para-
frapb, clipped from that High-Torv organ, Vanity
air, tells its own story:-" A fashion has sprung
up of late years, and a very bad one, too, amongst
members of society, of not uncovering In public
places when ‘ God Save the Queen’ is being played.
Some years ago any man dressed like a gentleman
who did not take off bis bat when the National
Anthem was being played, stood a very good
chance of having the said hat forcibly removed;
but now a>l manliness seems to bave left tbe
country.” If this means anything, it means tbat
we bave the authority of a leading Conservative
paper for stating that in England now-a-days very
few people grovel at the name of Her Most, &o.

few rich old parties now In their second childhood.
An absurd Radical Chelsea clergyman
writes a ridiculous and disloyal letter to the Lon-
don Times. He complains that he arranged for
a confirmation service which was to have been
bossed by the Bishop of London. At the time
appointed, the rows of elegantly-arrayed candi-
dates were there, so were all other sacerdotal
and ecclesiastical fixings appurtenant to such
ceremonies, but a comprehensive and interesting
vacancy alone represented the place which should
have been occupied by the Blab op. The whole
crowd—clergymen, choir, and congregation-
waited for some hours for the outpouring of the
Episcopal blessing, but they waited In vain, for
my lord of London had gone to attend the Prince
of Wales on a bridge-blessing expedition. Upon
these facts the curate takes upon himself to
seditiously satirise the Bishop.
There is a considerable row in Queensland
over Sir Sawmill Griffiths’ last election dodge. Ac-
cording to his latest scheme, every elector mast
fill up a " claim to vote,” stating his name In full,
whether "natural born” er naturalised, and about
a dozen other particulars, Including, we presume,
the date when the voter’s hair first began to fall
out, his measurement round base of brain, and his
object in not being a Chinaman. The Item
"natural born,” however, enrages most of the
residents of the great northern sin-garden. To an
Englishman “natural born” means being Illegiti-
mate—and illegitimacy is very natural indeed in
far Northern Queensland; to a Scotchman it Im-
plies a declaration of permanent lunacy, while
Shakespearian students quote Macduff’s history to
show how a white man can be born unnaturally.
Most people put in the words “ natural-born, but
neither an idiot nor a monstrosity.” “Qualifica-
tion,” is another awkward item, and one individual
clalpis to vote because he “ can read and write,
and is ef full age and upwards.” Then comes
“ length of residence,” and a great number fill this
up by putting In such answers as “33ft. long and
four rooms in it.” The point of Sir Sawmill's
weird northern j oke is that every one who stumbles
over his conundrums Is disfranchised, and as hla
own party have agents travelling round to see that
their friends fill up their papers all right, when next
election comes on they will be in full roroe, while
his opponents will hardly be able to rally one
“ natural born” voter for every dozen that they
count on.- Why did not Parkes strike this idea in
the days of his glory ? If he had he might
have been there—that is, in glory—at the present
moment.
BY FLOOD AND FIELD .
As events turned out it was rather a lucky
thing than otherwise that the Sydney Lancers and
Sydney Bicycle Club picked upon the same day for
their respective sports on the Agricultural and
Association Cricket Grounds, for both places were
so crammed with visitors that neither would have
held the two lots with any degree of comfort. At
the cavalry tournament the mounted jumping
without arms was very good. Trooper Cope, a
Soudan warrior, by the w»y, appearing to us to
have won hands down, but the Judges decided it a
tie with Trooper Vollmer, and in the Jump-off the
latter was award d tae prize. Captain Weston, of
the liiawarra Light Horse, rode bis horse and
handled his weapon like a “ tradesman,” and won
both the cieaving the Turk’s head, and Jumping
and cleaving the Turk a head competitions. The
tug-of-war proved an exciting item, tne Marines
and Mlttagong contingent meeting in the Aral
pull, whlcn was won by the Marines after a gallant
struggle. Military exercises of great variety filled
up the programme, and the Lancers may bo con-
gratulate! upon having bit the public taste in
their inaugural sports meeting. The capacious
grandstand was filled to excess, but as the day
wore on it became painful to look at the sports in
of the sun’s glare. The committee
Agricultural Ground must have been “iff
J“® lr heads ” when they had it erected facing the
setting sun. It was bad enough on Saturuay, but
wnat will it belike on a sultry January afternoon ?

The notice in the morning papers that Con.
i™Z? r B accident would prevent him from riding
?9Pths to come, did not tend to improve the
Attractions of the Sydney Bicycle Club’s fifth
annual meeting, but the bloyole people must have
been pleasurably surprised when the principal
event started In the presence of fully 13,000
persons. The ten-miles championship, for the
Gardiner Trophy; soon resolved itself Into a match
between C. R. Wood and J. 8. Foulkes, the latter
leading, with Wood as close uo as he could ride
consistent With safety. In this order they were
riding when the bell rang, and tne men commenced
the final lap at a great pace. At tbe back of the
course Wood drew on to Foulkes, when the latter
appeared to hold his own, and, if anything, im-
proved his advantage a shade, but rounding for
thb home turn Wood went past his man and won
with what we thought a bit to spare. In 35mln.

Melbourne, on July 10, Dwyer covered the distance

win of the One-Mile Invitation Scratch Race; F,
J. Davis. 150vds.. won the Mile Malden Handicap;
C. W. Mills. 190yds., carried off the Mile Open Han-
dicap; the AH Schools Mile fell to M. A. Veanard;

Flat Race, with 30yds. start; A. E. Browne won the
two-miles contest for the Mlllbrook Cup; and H.
Mutton, 375yd5., made an easy win of the Three-
miles Open Bloyole Handicap. Wood has won the
Ten-Miles Gardiner Trophy twice in susoesslon,
and it now becomes his property.

The crowd who went to Foley’s Hall on
Saturday night with the expectation of seeing a
good set-to between Lees and the "Champion
Amateur,” were treated to a disappointment, as
tbe show was anything but exciting. Mr. Seale,
with his sft. Sin. and 10at. 101 b. of avoirdupois,
looked a pigmy alongside his 6ft. odd in height and
13it opponent, but notwithstanding the disparity
in s'ze, Lees did not seem to fancy the task set
him, and allowed the little one to do all the lead-
ing. Lees landed a couple of right-handers on the
amateur, but too tar round to do any damage, and
beyond this, nothing was done in the first round.
In the second, the amateur got tired of waiting
for the lengthy one to lead, so placed his right a
couple of times cleverly on t ees’ face and brought
his left across rather heavily on his f*vourlte spot,
the "mark,” which seemed to rather knock the
wind out of Lees. In the third round, Lees ap-
peared to get savage, and tried several right-
handers. but he was all out of distance, and Mr.
dsf
AN AVERTED CALAMITY.
Naturally, if Mr. Jawbone Neild wanted a carriage to himself, he would start read-
ing his speeches; and naturally, also, the passengers would leave hurriedly; but none
of these things happened on Mr. Neild’s recem trip through the Northern districts of
New South Wales.
Seale appeared to enjoy the fun of either getting
back or ducking under them In the final, the
men came together a bit better, but no damage
was done by the time Jack Thompson told them
to shake bands. Mr. Seale's uphill game in box-
ing a clever professional of such height and
weight was made more difficult by the tactics of
the long one, who would not lead or be drawn by
the little one in front of him; but the amateur
came out of the fray with flying colours, and
showed himself by far the more scientific boxer of
the two. Steve O’Donnell, Peter Jackson’s pupil,
Is as fine a young fellow as they make 'em at 6ft.
in height and 13st. in weight, and he proved him-
self a good boxer in his four rounds with Peter
Newton. O’Donnell was fighting " reputation,”
no mean handicap, and got the worst of it at first,
but as soon as he settled down to bis tssk he
showed some clever boxing, and in the final round
there was nothing to choose between the pair.
Molloy got all over Meadows for two rounds, but
we fancy the Victorian is doing too much work,
as he tired in the final, and Meadows made a bit
better show. Little Murphy showed some of his
terrific hitting power on the plucky Burgess; the
scientific mite Pluto, as usual, had a lad twice his
size to face, and three or four other “ sots-to ”
made up a first-class evening’s sport.

Notwithstandiag the immense crowds at
the Association and Agricultural Grounds, the
Liverpool Jockey Gab had nothing to complain
of in the attendance at their race meeting on
Saturday. Sixteen runners started for the shorts,
of which Paladin, who bad the call at 3 to 1, made an
easy win by a length from Barrllda. Rebus mads
an easy win of the Selling Race from Sundial. The
20 to 1 chance Binalong won the Winter Handicap
from the favourite, Lifeboat; Rylstone made
rather an easy win of the Townplate from Sundial;
and Roobie finished the day's sport by winning the
Ladies’ Purse. There was an unpleasantness over
toe sale of Rylstone, when the owner struck a
gentleman who bid against him a heavy blow in
the face. It will be recollected it was over one of
these selling-races that old Terminus had his
throat out. Owners appear to think that It Is an
unwarrantable liberty for outsiders to bid against
them when a horse is put up after one of these so-
called selling-races, but, it only In their own in-
terests, the Jockey Club should put this sort of
thing down with a strong hand, or buyers may
prove scarce when a bid is attended with a smack
in the mouth. It is time the usage that owners
are not to be run up was broken through.

The Melbourne Cricket Club have taken
our advice and abandoned the Idea of bringing out
an English Eleven. Barlow and Read are to be in-
cluded in Shaw’s Eleven, which will probably be
the strongest professional team that has yet left
England’s shore. It was a cruel manoeuvre of the
Melbourne amateurs to try and best a team of men
who make their bread and butter out of the game,
and It is pleasing to see the professionals come out
of the fight victorious.

In the football field on Saturday last, the
defeat of Sydney University Club by tho Arfomas
created no end of surprise, as it was thought the
Gordons (who are again premier club) wore tbe
only ones able to lower the colour of the 'Varsity.
In the return match between Burwood and Wal-
laroo, the former won by 7 points to 3, not-
withstanding the fact that the Wallaroos were
represented by the five men chosen from their
ranks to play for N.S.W. against Queensland a
few weeks back, Burwood was not represented
in the second intercolonial match, and the win on
Saturday must prove a bitter pill for the selection
committee to swallow. The Balmains beat the
Balmain Wellingtons by 9 points to 6. but not-
withstanding their defeat, the latter showed they
are entitled to rank amongst the senior clubs.

An event advertised as the amateur mile
skating championship of Sydney was decided at
the—ahem I—" Carington” rink last week, though,
no doubt, sovne of the best skaters did not enter
because of tha extreme smallness of the course.
Being 36 iap.a to the mile, it was nearly “ all
corners,” moreover, competitors were re-
stricted To » certain make of wooden-wheel skates
vher** weie 33 entries, 30 men coming to the post,
AU'i cboy ran in heats of two or three together.
The eight winners of the first heats were:-J. 8.
Levy, H. Thompson, A. H. March, P. William-
son, T. Galloway, C. G. Hod son, J. Rlgg,
and F. J. Spencer. On Thursday night
they ran off la three heats, the winners
being Levy, Thompion, and Galloway, the miles
being done in 6.10, 6.1, and 6 3 respectively. Owing
to the smallness oi the ring, every contestant,
except the two last named, fell, some of them
several times. The final heat resulted in a win for
T Galloway, who is undoubtedly the fastest mao,
though Levy has a verv pretty and finished style.
Time, 6mia. Isec. There was a large and excited
audience, betting strongly in favour of Galloway,
and the affair was managed as well as could be in
such a small hall, but the building really permitted
no fair test of speed. H. Moyse has hitherto been
regarded as the best amateur in Sydney, having
made some capital performances at the large
Botany rink, and it would be interesting to see
him pitted against Galloway on that track,

As we write, we hear that Mr. Percy
M’Donnell, the brilliant young Victorian batsman,
is dying. Only last week one of Mr. M'Donnell's
brothers died—of blood-poisoning, which super-
vened on his having been taken to Melbourne hos-
pital after a tramcar accident.

Either of two is the case. Some horses are
not properly trained, or some sporting scribes

A cheque for £l9 had been given at
Charters Towers In a gambling transaction and
payment was stopped. It got into the hands
of a third party, who, on finding It dishonoured,
tore it to pieces in the presence of witnesses, and
he was charged with destroying valuable pro-
perty. Judge Noel held there was no evidence of
the cheque being valuable, and said: “ If a cheque
Is given for a gambling debt it can be dishonoured
as between the drawer and payee, but if allowed
to pass to an Innocent person it became of certain
value.” Prisoner was found not guilty.

MSr> felOWSfuo.-f, ti»hi« last great speech in the
N ; .S:W. Comic,!, displayed an originality that was
aS'Uoexpeeted as it was nnuauai. He is a strong
opponent! of cremation —at least, he is a violent
and; noisy one—and among other arguments on this
truly act! He urged that the stomachs of the dead
afford a good place for writing history, and
pointed; out that any modem records which may
be written on the stomachs of the present genera-
tion will be lost for ever should burning instead
of Interment become the fashion. • At the first
glance the idea is startling. I That tho human
gizzard—the outside of it, of course—should be
referred to as an authority in. disputed points of
ancient history suggests that tho owner of the
digestive organ, while alive, .carried his lore
where his dinner should have been, and that
after death it—the loro, not tho dinner-r-mado its
way to the surface. Mr. Piddlwgton’s argument
was based on the fact that about 3274 years ago
some Egyptian, with more money than brains,
spent fidooo in embalming Harasses ll.—supposed
to J>o Identical With the legendary Sesastris—and
wrote, some interesting historical faos on the dead
king's Ibreast. and now some scientific vandals
have dragged the old warrior from his long sleep,
and have bee.fi rewarded by a glimpse of Egyptian
history, as told by an Egyptian stomach. Mr.
Piddington further assorts that a regard for tho
sanctity of tho dead should forbid cremation, but
It never oecurs to him, probably, that very few
people would care to spend £2OOO for the sake of
embalming and writing history on the front of a
relative, only to have him dug wp and published
in after years.

There are certainly a good many
stomachs in the N.S. W. Upper House that afford
abundant scope for history, and there are one or
two'which would hold the, entire annuls of the
colony, aud leave space for a special chapter about
tho Soudan goat-scramble, the glories of Imperial
Federation, and tho popularity of Baron Carington ;
moreover, there are several which seem to have
been built exclusively for historical purposes, for
they have never shown tllcmselves to be good for
anything else. But there is something disagree-
able In the idea of a shrivelled, ghastly, hide-
bound Piddington, M.L.C.. being tom from his
rocky tomb and inspected ty a gaping crowd, say
In the year 5836; and it Is Just possible that the
future generation would read tho inscription upon
him, and then denounce it with brutal candour as
a stomach lie, and shove Mr. Piddington in the
dust-heap. No one would sympathise with the
dust-heap, and no one would know enough about
Ramoses Piddington to sympathise with him. He
wodld be nnknelled, uncoflined, and unknown,
but we cannot guarantee that ho would bo an-
kicked, for there are always people in this world
who are devoid of reverence for tho-doad, and
they might pound oa the stuffed councillor to see

Mhe would answer for a drum or a cymbal. But
after all It would bo hotter to bo burned and thin

wiser u Mr. Piddington would ca-ry hie Block of
history in his head while alive, than on hie
stomach', after death. No doubt the stomach
might be the more accurate of the two, but then,

Marcus Clarke was a litterateur who,
under stress of circumstance, worked as a jour-
nalist. These are different professions. They
become one when the litterateur is low, or the
journalist high. Kepler told fortunes from the
stars. He didn’t believe a bit in them, but the
money he made in that way enabled him to study
the higher astronomies. A man cannot live by
literature in Australia. There are no magazines
or reviews to give adequate employment to that
order of ability. The literature of the newspapers
is mostly foreign. There are syndicates in Eng-
lund who will sell to Australian newspaper pro-
prietors the right of publishing English serials at
ss. per column. The editor fills his novelists’ page
in this way. It saves money to the firm and con-
ceals his own incapacity to determine the merit of
manuscripts. The proprietors are not themselves,
mail oases, intellectual men, and the editors know
that. Literature was higher in Australia twenty
years ago than it is now. Its prospect was less in-
terrupted. Literary quacks, by projecting bogus
Australian magazines, which were no more than
advertisements of theirpromoters and afew others
of similar ambitions, have done the pursuit much
harm But still the literary mind exists It is oc-
casionally detectable even in the columns of the
newspaper. Breadth and depth of view, elevation
of sentiment and generous appreciation of con-
flicting opinions, are discovered. The trend of the
literary mind Is to wards the permanent, that of
the journalistic towards the temporary. The
apotheosis of the journalistic mind is the short-
faand reporter: the apotheosis of the literary mind
Is the epic poet. Marcus Clarke’s journalism was
not of the usual kind. It was akin to the Bohe-
mianisra of journalism one may meet in London
or Paris. It called on faculties of thought that
the typical journalist Ignores or is ignorant of. It
polished sentences that the typical journalist
throws together anyhow. There is sloppiness in

The acting of the play was intelligent. Mr.
Leitoh s Rev. Joshua Meekln was a well-worked-
out conception. The character fits. It is the
clearest-marked and best-sustained in the nlav
The gentleness, amiability, delicacy, and elaborate
formality of the little divine are nicely pourtrayed
We mean the word nicely. Mr. Leltch must have
been strongly tempted to broaden some features
into burlesque. The pronunciation of a word, and
the race from observation here and there, indicate
that the temptation was at work. But he kept his
Idea tightly in hand and produced a homogeneous
picture. Miss Thomas played Sylvia. When first
Bbe is seen she ia older than the novel represents*
but one gathers an image of what she wants to bo
and comes to like her. Where, at Port Arthur.
Hawes tries to awaken in her a recollection of
himself and of his past relations with her, her atti-
tude of unconsciousness is skillfully managed.

The short farce “Nan,” with which the
entertainment commenced, deserves a passb g
kick -we mean notice. It is the story of a dirty
utile girl of the tomboy deimilptlun, who is
adopted by a couple of British workmen, and who
afterwards repents and washes herself with a bar
or yellow soap. She also saves a child from drown-
ing, tears the landlord's son to rags and hits him
on the head with a cabbage, and makes love to a
young man of the milk-and-water, oow-and-pump
school. Her two fathers are wooden-headed te-
description, and we regret to mention that
they don t wash themselves. They shed tears

Owing to a combination of adverse cir-
cumstances we did not do justice to the new pro-
gramme of the Federate at Sydney Academy. The
opening songs were excellent, especially Mr.
Reads ‘Touch the Harp gently,’’ but just as we
were In the height of enjoyment Alf. Moynham
rose and announced la verse that he would “Like
° Alligator.” This stupendous outburst of
ambition knocked us flat, and we fell to drawing
lanoy pictures of Alf with a long scaly tail, wnich
would be capable of flicking a Baptist chu. oh Into
the middle of a Catholic cathedral, ihen we
began to speculate ob the changes wo would have
to make In All’s anatomy in order to fix on the

Joints of his spine and tie on the caudal appendage
with barbed wire. When wo awoke from our
reverie an interesting farce, entitled “Fun In a

circumstance entirely beyond our control—an
Irish circumstance six feet high, with a strong
Tipperary accent—called us away, and we saw no
more of the performance that night.

“The Bohemian Girl” has now taken the
place of “The Chimes of Normandy” at the New
Masonic Hall, Sydney, and proves at least an equal
success. It Is a considerable time since we last
witnessed this piece, and we not unreasonably
feared, therefore, thnt in tie Interval the
Bohemian girl might have grown up and married
aod got old and gray, perhaps even bald, and that
we might flnd her engaged spanking a family of
towzled little Bohemians, or awaiting the return
home of a convivial husband who stays out late at
his club and rrives in a state of glorious Bohemia
drunk. It was a great relief, therefore, to find er
88 young and charming as ever, though her peren-
Dial freshness is unaccountable. Perhaps she was
originally twins, however, and this may be the
other one, for the last we saw was certainly about
45 years of age, and blasted of a bush of hair
which made us think a Chinese washimr-bill had
taken root on the top of her head. Moreover,
soe addressed her baronial parent without an “ h,”
and that Individual, when his long-lost ohe-ild was
restored to him, wept as though he had been peel-
ing onions, and pressed a long and pathetic-looking
Austrian nose against her shoulder in an outburst
of joy. wa are prepared, however, to take our
solemn affidavit that the Bohemian girl whom
we saw on Saturday was not the same, and after
viewing her performance we can only hope that
the other one has found out her true vocation
and Is now carrying bricks.

As Devilshoof, Mr. Farley carried off a
large share of the honours. No doubt a certain
class of critics will complain, as before, that his
acting was lacking in energy, and to a certain ex-
tent the charge would be well-founded; In other
words, he did not flop up and down like an insane
horse In a dust-hole at critical moments, nor climb
three feet in the oxygen, and claw after the great
unattainable when defying his enemies In the first
act, and thereby give them a chance to dodge be-
tween his legs and take him in his Bohemian
rear when he came down. Had he done so he
would probably have afforded a little extra grati-
fication to the cheap gods at the back, but, on the
other hand, the average gipsy Is too indolent to
Hop unless it is absolutely necessary, and Devlls-
hoof Is a typical gipsy, though a little more daring
than the majority of his class. Mr. Farley pour-
trayed him as a cool, hardened, world-worn ad-
venturer, alert and watchful, but not noisy, a man
who never howls unless something Is to be gained
by it, and even then howls no louder than he can
help, and the representation could hardly be Im-
proved upon. Mr. Walshe was a success as
Tnaddeus, though, as before, his singing was
better than his acting. He was a great Im-
provement on the last down-trodden Pole
we met, an Individual with a broken hat,
who looked as if he had exchanged shirts
with a completely naked Hottentot, and who
had us for half-a-crown, after telling a woe-
ful tale of suffering. His name was Smith, and
we have felt bad on Poles ever since. Miss Bt. John
made her first appearance this season In the
character of Arline, and gave a really splendid
rendering of the part, her singing taking the
audience by storm at the outset. Mrs. Florence
Seymour played the Gipsy Queen well, but the
character la not so well suited to her as that of
Germaine In "Les Cloches de Cornevllle;” and
Mr. Templeton appeared as the red-legged, badly-
shaven Count. Possibly Austrian razors are not
sharp, or it may be that counts are bora In a stuboly
condition, but at all events we hope, for the credit
of the aristocracy, that those gaudy pants which
loomed on the stage like the glare of a conflagra-
tion in a chemical factory, are not common. In
the second and third acts this gentleman was
toned down a little by means of a dirt-coloured
tuft on his chin, but even then he figured as a
lurid bass fly—or rather blue-bottle—ln the
operatic ointment (metaphor a little mixed).

We hate to accuse anyone of forgery,
especially when we can't prove it, but we would
be glad to know where one individual in the or-
chestra got those notes which he blew through a
wind Instrument. He was pt-acelul and even quiet
at times, but just at a critical moment he anu hie
blow-pipe rose together like a shriek in a ceme-
tery, and the ensuement was rememnersome. vVe
only once heard it equalled, and that was by an
anonymous animal, half dog and half dynamite
scare—a low and vulgar beast which we don’t
want to see again—in a travelling menagerie.
The Sydney Royal Standard was crowded
on Friday when “ Tne Merchant of Venice ” was
produced. Sandwiched In between the peri-
winkles and the larrlkinlsm of Thursday night,
and the convict-flogging business, which was
resumed on Saturday, Shylock was placed in
rather bad company, but he made the best of the
Infliction. Our own sympathies are entirely with
the afflicted and embezzled Heorew. According to
his own snowing In the first act, he is used as a
spittoon and a door-mat, and various other articles
of domestic furniture, by the Christian merchant,
and yet during all the years since the drama was
written It seems to have occurred to very few
that accounts would best be squared by turning
Antonio Into cats -meat and making Shylock a
K.O.M.G. In recompense for his past sufferings.
Tne Venetian merchant spends his whole lire m
treading on a hook-nosed Israelitish worm, and
when at length the tough, yellow reptile tuns, ail
Venice roils up to jump on him. Yet Shy-
lock is dignified to the last. When hla
daughter skedaddles with his oriental over-
draft he curses her with vigour and intelli-
gent energy, btJt his curse is nothing cotnpared to
the last words of an Australian hushman, when he
nies with a boomerang in his stomach and an
empty whisky bottle by his side, and the Jew tc at
ail events much better than his modern proto-
yll he liven at the present day he wou d
probably be writing novels and dedicating them

ana ®“aking hand* with Lord Carlngton, or be
would be a philanthropist, or a public nuisance,
? T r a “e might even be o inverted and become a
N.B W. Christian—not a Galilee Christian, for teat
species Is extinct. Antonio, on the other hand,
though he gets all the public sympathy, is a mean
and bigoted sneak of the old Venetian school. He
is not good enough to turn into a decent kanaka
or horse-thief; he would make only a fifth-rate
tmnaman, for he has neither energy nor brains
enough to look like a Mongol, and he is very
little better than an average ML a. What Bhy-
look meant to do with the pound pf flesh, had he
“ aa nevo r been explained, bht It is probable
that he Intended to give it to the yellow dog that
howled at night in the next yard, and thereby
take a fiendish vengeance on that slush-coloured
animal. But, unfortunately, his design mis-
carries, and the drama concludes with the spec-
tacle of a- baffled money-lender, one-third Oanaan-
ite, one-third Venetian lunatic, and one-third
bottomless pit. humping Antonio's dishonoured
promissory-note oil the stage. The document is
not very heavy to carry, but if the unlucky
Jerusalem man had also to carry all the sins which,
Antonio calmly acknowledged in the first act he
W «S ii v® been compelled to load a bullock-dray
with lies and meanness, and even then a lot of
™® di «3val Christianity would have trailed
behind the over-laden vehicle.

Mr. .Dampier put away his eye-glass and
P” 4 the J 0W > and it is a relief to note
that ohylock does not go to chase cows on the
Hawkesbury. The spectacle of an aged Hebrew
trying to milk a haughty Christian cow would not
beedllying. Mr. Holloway gave up hearing voices
of the night on the damp grass of the Domain, and
made a tolerable Antonio; Mr. Harry Leston
transposed himself from a Chinaman—whose name
sounded like a bad coid-into the Venetian
Gratiano, but something of the odour of Lower
George-street seemed to cling round him still, like
a slop-halo on an unhealthy saint. The perform-
acce will be repeated, however, on Friday, and we
will endeavour to give the other characters the
notice they deserve in our next issue. For the
present “ His Natural Life ” is again to the fore,
and is proving a great financial success; but for
our own part we would rather hunt up the beast
of Revelations than visit it again. This animal,
by the bye, “ continued for 43 months,” so we
presume he also was a financial success, and that
the beastly treasury was well filled.

At Sydney Princess the hairy Buffalo is
ending his career In a blaze of horned glory. On
Saturday, “a great double bill” was presented,
a sort of thing that is often presented to us by th*
gas official, owing to the mendacity of the meter,
and a good attendance resulted. Two large new
jokes, and a few v ry good songs w re given; and

more than usual, and turned himself out-

and swallowed something—we could not exactly
see what, bur we fancy it was himself, and the
great double bill” as well, after wbiob ‘‘Blinks
and Jinks ” brought the performance to a success-
ful olo«e, and left about 10 baskets of smashed
nigger lying about the stage. The season has been
a good one on the whole, though the Princess is a
theatre which it is very hard to run as a financial
success, and a good deal ol credit is due to Mr
Ashton for the results he has achieved in the
111-omened York-street caravanserai.

A London actress sued a critic for damages,
he having described her as “an antique” She
proved that her age was not such as to justify that
term, and that she had been annoyed by letters
asking her if she had any Latin inscriptions any-

The critic had to pay, but had his revenge by
announcing next day that he had been in error,
that the lady was about to celebrate her 18th

structed after the pantomime pattern, whereon
all the characters have their personal character-

himself on his stlOK and scanning her pretry face
through his eye-glass. “ Why. I’m playing at

he repeated. “Egad, I thought you had given

THE NEW HEBRIDEAN OUTLOOK.-AJAX JOHNNY CRAPAUD DEFIES THE JINGO LIGHTNING.
(A BIT OF REALISTIO ART, A LA BARNET).


THE CHINESE IN AUSTRALIA.
Their Vices and Their Victims.
Disease, defilement, depravity, misery, and crime
—these are the indispensable adjuncts which make
Chinese camps and quarters loathsome to the
senses and faculties of civilised nations. What-
ever neighbourhood the Chinese choose for the
curse of their presence forthwith begins to reek
with the abominations which are ever associated
with their vile habitations. Wherever the pig-
tailed pagans herd on Australasian soil, they Intro-
duce and practise vices the most detestable and
damnable—vices that attack everything sacred in
the system of European civilisation-vices which
cannot be named In print, and others Infinitely
worse, so horrible and heinous that they cannot
be spoken of by man to man. Corruption and
pollution the most vile, characterise these centres
radiate widely therefrom, for the Mongolian
Octopus grows mightily within Australian terri-
tory, end stealthily, but surely Includes in the
grasp 01 his with* ring and remorseless arms a dally
increasing number of helpless and hopeless
victims. vp |
The whole wotld of land and water produces no
form of animal iite so repulsive as that of the
octopus. In dark ocean eaves this brute bides Its
hideous body, and Its prehensile limbs shoot cut
thence silently and swiftly to grip its unsuspecting
prey. 80 sudden is the attack that the victim
knows not its danger until the saucer-shaped
suckers, by which ihe limbs fasten, are puu ping
Its heart s-blood into the insatiable maw of its
captor rnd there is no escape for the prey
Until its blood ai d life are alike exhausted; when
this is accomplished, the sapless body is permitted
to fell away aw fl- at where it will, but so long as
there is silli a sing le drop of bit od remaining, the
suckers adhere with more than leech-like persist-
ence and mutt he cut away one by one before relief
can be obtained.
So with the Mongolian Devil-fish. Lurking
in bis hiding-places. bis arms are swift to
seize unwary vutms which so grappled can never
Obtain a releate so long as they are capable
of a disgraceful usefulness, profit, or pleasure
Wherever this hideous monster forces an en-
trance he stays; wherever he stays he grows,
and his growth is induced and made memor-
able by the destruction ot all whom he can
grasp and hold by mi ans of the sinews and suckers
within and upon his ever-lengthening, ever-
Btrei gtbei ing arms Every one of these arms,
each of these sessile suckers has its own clats of
victims, or especial mission of iniquity. Ore arm
shoots out ano drains the blood of those who ap-
proach the Jan-tan table; another brings the pak-
-Bh-pu or lottery-swindle suckers into play; a
third sucks thr< ugh the agency of the hop tuck, or
opium-pipe which yearly draws from bundteosof
persons thtlr ability, integrity, and virtue;
another plunders the law-abiding, and usually
moral white worku an, who sees the labour which
is rightly his, torn from him by a set of moon eyed
whoren ongi rs, who neither know nor fulfil any
avoidable duties to the State or mankind Cor-
ruptli n, dinct and indirect, endows a fifth arm
with power to do evil, and health is drawn in by
other tentacles which work by aid of the demons ot
disease bred in the dark, and filthy dens, where the
Chinese reck'ets.y crowd, and where they allure
the vicums of their lust Such are some of the
results ot the existence of the Chinese Devil-fish In
the cities and towns of Aust alia Such are some
of the kinds of his devastating labours, and such
are his pitiable victims. Fet, as like his prototype,
he shrinks away into dark corners and dens, his
mode anc means ot iite, and the magnitude of bis
operations are known only to those whom hejruins,
and to them the knowledge never comes till
the suckers are doing their merciless work.
That is why Chinamen are tolerated in Australia.
If the nature of their Hie, its objects, and results
were fully known, there w ould not be one China-
man left on the continent; public ignorance on
these points is the only ihing that saves the Mon-
golians from instant expulsion. To set down, as
we propose, a lew tacts about the Chinese in
Sydney,,necessarily entails a charge o) sensational-
ism, but ytt we only publish one-third of our
knowledge of the subject. One-third more is not
fit to be set forth in print, and an equal portion is
forbidden by a libel-law, trained apparently
In the direct interests of all who commit
criminal a«ts. For months we have been col-
lecting information of the Chinese, and visiting
them in their most secret, and therefore mos
loathsome, dene. We have allowed them to rob
ns at fan-tar and pak-ah-pu; to sicken us with
loathsome effluvia which burden their vile
breath, and hang like a fog within their narrow
and polluted dens. That we have risked health
and safety, la merely a i ecessary incident of theen
qulty; that i very faculty and sense has been af
fronted by the variousleatures of the ecenels only
an assertion of the fact that ordinary white men are
less degraded than the Mongols and their victims
And having thus ascertained the truth of the
whole question, we venture to publish a portion ol
that, regardless cf ihe fact that there will be many
who taunt us from the pulpit and ihe press with
the charge of being mere sensationalists.
» * *
What do the general public of New South Wales
think ol ihe Chinese? They buy cabbages from
them, never asking bow these cabbages have bt en
growr ; they occasionally buy cigars from them,
without et quint g whether those ctgars have paid
any duty or not they buy iurniture, not
troubling to ei nslder by what class ofworkirf
that iurniture his been midt; and perhaps they
think the almond-eyed Mcrgol not half a bad
fellow. They even ascribe sen e admirable virtues
to him. Be does net drink, it is said, and is, there-
fore, more moral than the Australian, who has a
lamentable tendency that way; he is civil, even to
sycophancy ; he has solved the i roblem of growlr g
carrots out of sewage and sard; and as be sells bis
goods usuaity a shade below the price required by
Buropeaia, the urenquiring purchasers are in-
clined to regard him with a mild kind of admira-
tion. Ihi y see that there are tome advantages to
he galred by dealing with him, and they
know nothing, and therefore believe notbirg, re-
garding bis devastatlrg vices. Bis pt ck-sears are
regarded as a peculiarity ot the Celestui skip; the
grime which his lace bears, and of which the
icureatuns were laid immediately alter his birth

gamblers are fle* ced There the unsophisticated
junior clerk who, for the first time in his life, is
earning a ‘ salary Ihe n ore experienced book
krei er, whose reason tells him he is a fool to sub-
mit to so tald a system of robbery; the ’cute
waiter, who is wide aw*ke in all mcney-deal-
Itgs, save with the Mongolians; and the otherwise

come to a sia»e of stone-broke, and tnen sullenly
and slowly pass cut with a deep contempt of the
folly which leads them on to misery and ruin, but
usually wlthan equally firm determination to come
back and “slate tne Chows ’’ by means of some in-
fallibly remunerative style of play on a future
occasion.
There is a fearful fascination about the game.
There are no enticements In the surround-
ings, no soft allurements to the vice, and no
attem pt whatever to cloak the process of robbery.
The “tan-dealer ” is usually repulsively ugly even
for a Mongolian; the cashier generally uglier still:
and the animal who acts as door-keeper and
ohucker-out, a striking compound, unless his face
be a libel, of all the worst varieties of vice and vil-
lainy which are capable of attaching tt em selves to
the human mind. Everything Is repellent, every-
thing vile about the Chinese fan-tan dives. There la
the heavy-bodled leering trinity of gaudlly-oalnted
sods against the wall, before whom a gloomy oll-
amp continually burns; there are the reck-
less and dissipated gamesters who hang round
*» , teolos; there Is the glaring swindling
of the tan-dealer, and the frequent “polnt-
ing of the cashier; and there Is the seeth-
ing, stinking atmosphere of the room, reek-
ing with the odour of opium, flsh-oIJ, Chinese
cookery, sewerage, and all manner of muck—all
tbes# things eloquently protesting against the
presence of any persons who respect themselves,
or desire to be respected by others. Yet, In spite
of all disgusting and repelling Influences, there
are men—young and old- some well and carefully
creased, some evidently of repute In circles
where their gambling habits are not known,
playing at lunch-time. In the afternoon, or
at night, whenever they can escape for a few
moments from office or from ho-ie sk the mer-
chants who carry on business in the vicinity of
hose places how many clerks they have had to
dismiss because of a fatal fondness for these
gam«s; tsk other employers who nave suffered
trom peculations-peculations brought about by
the Intatuailon of fan-tan; or ask the poverty-
oppressed wife who lives on a crust because her
husband s ample wage Is weekly offered on the
fan-tan board as an oblation to a fate directed by
an Infallible system of swindling-ask them how
great a power this hell-born game has over Its
European victims. And on this point useful and
valuable testimony comes from Mr. Groom, of
Melbourne, who has for years been trying to
evolve the latent virtues of a large number of al-
leged larrikins. He states that one 01 the chief
difficulties in the way of reforming bis boys is the
tact that they are constantly drawn back Into all
manner of vice by the Irresistible attraction of
these tatal fan-tan tables.
But what, it may be wondered. Is this game
which exercises so potent an Irfluence? It Is as
simple as plteh-and-toes The appliances consist
only of a square plate of Iron, numbered 1,3 3,
and 4 on the respective sides, and a number'd
counters or •‘cash,” In size something like ordl-
narv trouser-buttons. The dealer takes a handful
oi these trom the ample heap before him and puts
them under a cupthen the money is staked on
either side of the board ; the dealer litts the cup,
rakes out the counters by four at a time, and the
number remaining after the lest four Is diawn de-
termines the winning side. Thus. If there be 33
counters placed under the cup, four Is the winner*
11 31, three, and so on with other numbers. Then
the winners. If any, are paid, and a fresh deal at
once started. The methods of swindling are ex-
crescences all over the alleged game. The odds
paid to winners are substantially 3 to 1 every
time ; they nominally amount to this, whether
the money Is placed on the “ fan,” or the
* nlm. or the “ save,”— positions which need
not be described—but a commission varying
rrom to about 20 per cent Is deducted
trom winners, and other dodges unnumbered but
not unknown, are constantly practised. There la
the device of ■‘spring-coins.” These are slightly
thicker than the ordinary counters, snd when
tapped with the stick used by the dealer for
raking them In, the spring which holds the two
halves of the coin together Is released, and what
was a sli gle coin counts two. Thus, H the three
Is heavily backed while th© four carries bo money,,
spriDg-eoin ©Babies the dealer to swindle the
rightful wieners and ‘ ecoop the pool.** But this
device is not very often med; It Is liable to detec-
tlor, and other methods are easier. Besides the
commission, which is good every time, there Isa
steady means of gain In the power which the
dealer acquiresi by lorg practice of knowing by
the weight of the counters which he lifts frem the
heap how many there are, and, consequently,
what the remainder win be. This may seem
utterly Incredible, but it rests upon strong proof.
Otten in the day-time when no victims are ex-
pected, the “tan-dealer” may be seen taking un
the counters, lifting up, and then counting them
to see if his estimate of their number is correcl • and
frequently when big money is placed upon a num-
ber just bef< re the cup Is lifted, a look of anger
may be noticed in the eyes of the otherwise un-
impressionable and Immovable dealer. A good
••t-dealer” in ’Frisco is frequently paid as much
as £5 a night, and it Is affirmed that the services of
such are of almost equal value in Sydney and
Melbourne.
It is strange that so glarlrg and well-known a
system of swindling should have any power over
men who have intelligence enough to play, vet
the power Is undeniable. Here Is a single
Instance In proof. A few nights ago, a re-
spectabJy-dressed and raiher handsome young
man, who had apparently just about reached
his majority, lounged over on® of the tables.
He had lost his last copper, and, after
vainly offering to stake his pocket-knife against
sixpence, as vainly tried to borrow coppers
from the other players. Disappointed In this he
turned upon the dealer and cursed him and his
ancestors back to the reign of Hung Pat, or there-
abouts, In eloquent and forcible blasphemy. Then
he turned to go out, probably In search of a more
fortunate table or charitable crowd. As he got to
the door he shivered; the night was piercingly
cold and the rain descending pitilessly And one
who had witnessed the scene stopped him in the
street and learnt the full tale of his woes. He had
that day been dismissed from bis third situation-
each lost by his Infatuation for fan-tan No door
w»s open to him, he had pawned everything, and
must stay out *ll night-" find a boiler somewhere;
perhaps, was bis hopeless reflection. But his in-
quisitor promised to provide for him for the night,
gave him the equivalent of bed and breakfast?on
the single condition of a promise willingly and
fervently given, never to go into a gambling den
again; then the two shook bands and parted. But
not for long Hardly had the Samaritan gone 601
yards when the other came running up to him
sgaln. ’Take It,” he said, holding out the moneys
take It. for God s sake, and pay them for a bed
m .e somewhere I Take Itl If you leave me
with It 1 will only go back to those thev
will rob me ag»ln, and I will have to sleep out in
this cold after all.”
Down from the fan-tan den are stairs leading to
lower and dirtier abodea: rooms darker and
Kore greasy than anythirg on the ground-
rooms where the lepion of sggreseiTO
stinks peculiar to Chinamen seem ever to lin-
ger, and where the forms of the grimy
Mongolians passing to and fro with shufii-
icg, sneaking step, seem more like demons of
another world than debased inhabitants of this.
Viler than pigstyes, gloomier than caves, and
fouler than sepulchral vaults, these cellars and
passages possess the worst attributes ot each of
these places. Yet the rooms are not naturally re-
pulsive, nor would they be so when occuiledby
other tenants; but the Cblnaman has defiled their
walls with his filthy touch; he has vitiated what
was once a reasonably pure atmosphere, with hla
preset ce, and he has polluted the premises with
his disgusting habits; and so it is that nought save
suggestlor sot evil, incentives of disgust, and as-
sociations of vice, now seems to move in the fetid
atmosphere. Here, more than any where else, per-
haps, the casual visitor is struck with the total
immunity of Chinamen from the laws of the land
in which they live. Not only do their dwellings
disclose the most reckless disregard of all regula
tlons and penalties to w nlch Australians are rig htlv
subject, but the facilities for escaping the newer
oi ail Jaws is amply apparent. To apprehend a
Cblnaman who la known to have offended would
be like catching one particular rat out of a thou-
sand running loose in a coal cellar. To Identify
Mongolian, where all are so much
alike, is a feat which would generally baffle the
smartest detective In Sydney, and to find “m to
the gloomy recesses of his grimy abode. Is a ten.
times more < ifflcult matter. Like the devil-fish
which, pursued by an enemy, obscures thewateiw
with an inky cloud, so the Chinaman hides wfth/3
the congenial darkness and mszy intricacies of
habitations seemingly constructed with »he stegle
aim of protecting him from a righteous retrlbu-

tkon. From one house to another he may pass, as
passes a rabbit through all the passages radiating
from a warren, and so it happens that unleis a
Chinan: a« Is caught red-handed In crime, be it
burglary, coin-sweating, larceny, smuggling, or
assault, he Is able to put the terrors of the law at
open defiance. £
Independent cf the punitive power of the crimi-
nal, so, also, the Chinaman is regardless of ihe
remedial power of tbe civil law. By enactments
Of Immemorial antiquity the freedom of all who
tread British soil Is assured, but the Chinaman
cares nothing for this. He imports his fellows
here and keeps them in a condition of slavery
until they have worked out their own enfranchise-
ment, He Imports Chinese women sometimes and
sells them (asone was sold a few daysagoln Sydney
for £350 cash), to whomsoever is willing to Invest
in so precarious a properly. No ai sistanse would
be given by the courts oi Law or Equity for the
enforcement of such contracts, but he is indepen-
dent ol such aid. There is the authoiity en-
forceable by his own tribunals, and he requires
nothing more. For all practical purposes the
Chinese are as independent of Australian authority
as the Frenchmen of New Caledonia, or the
Esquimaux who tread their native ice.
Ascending again tbe narrow stairs which lead
down to the lower regions of the dwelling, and pass-
ing through the fan-tail room, another creaking,
narrow staircase-slippeiy with dirt, and much
worn by the pilgrimages of Infatuated gamblers
—leads up to the den where pak-ah-pu spiders
feed upon the money and the life of the deluded
human flies. The den is disagreeably ominous cf
the consequences of crime. A narrow passage,
hounded by the wall on one side, and by a breast-
high partition continued by means ol gnm-looklng
wooden bars, suggestive of the prisoners dock at
a criminal court, on the other, is peopled by a
number of the ticket-holders In this particular
“bank.” They have paid their “lokoloey ’ (six-
pence), marked off their 10 figures, and now wait
with desperate hoptiulneis to see how many of
their markings will correspond with the 10 marked
off by tbe bank. If they get five thus coinciding,
they win Is. 2d.; if six, 95.; if 7, £3 13s. 6d.; if 8,
£2015s ;if 9. £36; and if all 10 so correspond, £7O.
It Is the apparent munificence of these prizes that
makes the swindle so popular. But tbe dimensions
of the chance ot winning a prize areln much less than
Inverse ratio to the magnitude of tbe prize itself.
The data of the calculation are easily obtained, for
the ticket purchaser strikes out 10 characters ejf
the 80 on the paper, and the bank obliterates 20
mote. It is, therefore, 4 to 1 against the choos-
ing of any particular number by the
bank. And what is the chance of ten num-
bers coinciding ? Ask the smartest mathema-
tician in fiydney. Give him reams of paper and
a week for tbe calculation. Or ask the Melbourne
professors who tried for a month to log it out,
and then could only say that the answer was in
tens of thousands. The chances are altogether
out ol proportion to tbe amount of the possible
prizes. In Ban Francisco, where the same game is
run on a large scale, tbe price of the ticket is 10
cents (flvepence), and tbe highest prize 1300 dollars
(£260), and yet the “ bank” wins hugely at that. To
come cut a winner at pak-ah-pu at New South
Wales prices the ticket-holder must be endowed
with “ luck” such as is only granted to one man in
a million, and tbe Mongolians make ihelr m< ney
on the other 599.999. The investors In these tickets
do not know tbe magnitude of tbe odds against
which they contend. They can comprehend the
Wide difference beiweer the price of a ticket, six-
pence, and the value, £7O, of tbe highest prize, but
they cannot understand that between the ticket
and the prize there is a great gulf ol chance fixed
which few—very few—are ever able to cross ro
they buy the tickets. They keep the “banks”
going, both in George and Goulburn streets, every
halt-hour throughout the day, and through the
greater part of the night, and time after timeth* y
stand before the partiti- ns and poke their noses
through the wooden bars, while they await, with
hope ever doomed to disappointment, the result of
the drawing of the numbers. This is managed
generally In a fair and straightforward manner.
With oddsof 108tolin their favour, the Mongolian
swindlers can afford to keep up a pretence of
straightforwardness. In that part of the room,
shut off by the partition from tbe outer passage,
four or five of them usually sit, while another
manages the drawing. Duplicates of all tickets
purchased are handed in, and then the drawing
commences. Eighty single characters similar to
those upon the tickets, each Inscribed upon
a separate ticket, are then folded up and
put into a large bowl. These are next dealt
out into lour smaller bowls. Characters repre-
senting these smaller bowls, inscribed on coun-
ters, marbles, or cards, are placed upon a tray,
and one Is taken up by any one of tbe persons
standing outside. Thus the bowl containing the
20 fateful numbers is chosen, and a Chinaman
proceeds to slowly chant the names of these as he
pastes them one by one on a board, while the
other Mongolians within the enclosure mark
them off upon blank tickets pinned ready to band
upon the tables before them. Then the disap-
pointed investors behind the bars compare their
markings with those of the bank, and file
moodily and mournfully downstairs again ;
some of them to spend the night under
the open sky, tor often enough that enticing
u Be venty pounds for sixpence” induces wretched
victims to pawn their coats for a ticket; some of
them to wonder how they will square their “petty
cash” at the office on the morrow-for pak-ah-pu
loses more situations in the northern end of
fix dm y than any other cause, and some of them
to buy more tickets or to have another try at the
fan-tan tables. A bigger swindle than pak-ah-pu
never was Invented; more merciless swindlers
than tbe men who run it never came to Australia,
and greater fools than the investors In tickets
never were born.
Yet for all that it will continue to claim
Its victims as long as there is a Chinaman In
Sydney. The police may obtain convictions, as
they have already done in the case of Ah Toy,
Charley Torse, and others, but about future
prose cutlons there will be the wretched half-
heartedness which always characterises all prose-
cutions of Mongolian criminals, and if 20 banks
are stopped there will still be enough going
to bring immense revenue to the commer-
cial promoters of these ingenious systuns
of public robbery. The detectives, able and
conscientious men, usually find themselves, for
some reason, unable to check these unlawful
nroceedlngs. If the banks are prevented
from acting openly they will transact their
business in that covert manner at which
Chinese are adepts. It is absurd to suppose that
the police will now be able to tffectually prevent,
without tbe enactment of new laws, the system of
wholesale robbery which tor years past they have
been utteily unable even to limit or check The
Mongolian ia not easily eit cum vented by law. His
firar acouaintanee with colonial authority is in his
evasion of the £lO poll-tax; the first English he
rears Is that contained ia the Acts relating to
gambling.
And the Chinese have another means of self-
?rotection against the terrors of the Criminal Law
heir New Year is a joyous season Their hearts
bubble over with generosity and good-will at that
particular period. They are Imnelleo then to give
presents to all their friends and acquaintances,
and i is strange how many friends a Chinaman
discovers at that period, ano friends also who
could, if they would only give the necessary In-
structions, bring unpleasant pressure to bear In an
inconvenient manner. Virtue is its o»n rew. rd
Generosity is a virtue. J. hn s generosity brings
srreat reward. And sc it nappens that ■ bin ese
fan-tan tables bri g him in a reman-ably large
revenue; bispak-ah pu swindles are magnificently
remunerative; his smuggling ventures, even if
discovered and proved, are not always very
severely punished; his coquettings with ‘Maly
Ann” in an opium-den are not penalisid;
and bis infraction of ’he whole criminal code at
pleasure brings no retribution, or at least rarely
such as would be commensurate with the offence.
strangely enough, the cabbage-growing China-
men are not so generous in their gifts. “Toning
Siwara as toils tbe dull bullock ’ among their
uninspiring esculents, they grow boorish and
strictly commercial in sentiment. But their more
enlightened brother, to whom Inspiration is wafted
from tbefan-tan table, generosity instilled with the
odour of smuggled cigars, and beneficence borne
upon the melody of the' 1 pak-ab-pu chant. Is
elevated by these influences ;'his soul swells out In
gratitude accordant with the inspiration, and he
willingly lavishes ample gifts upon a whole lot
of people. The code of Draco might adorn the
Statute-Book of New South Wales, and yet It
would not avail a very great lot so long as John
maintains bla present munificence. The Ameri-
cans have at last risen to an appreciation of this
fact. All the laws they could pass had no power
to curb Mopgolian eccentricities; despite all legis-
lative enactments John refused to be clean, to be
honest, or to be moral; with Increase of numbers
esme huger developments of vice; every objec-
tionable feature was magnified as the Chinese
population became more dense; and now, a* a
final resource, and as the only means of removing
a national cancer, the States are trying to effect
the gradual but complete expulsion of the
detested and degraded race. Wherever be gees
the Chinaman adapts his surroundings to himself.
The Chinese camps and colonies all over Australia,
from Cape York to Cape Otway, from Port
Jackson to Perth, are essentially similar In their
filth, their independence tf local laws, ttelr
agencies of degradation and disaster; and entirely
the seme In the class of persons Wbc m they bury
In moral ruin. Where Altlla s steed trod no blade
of grass afterwards grew; similarly, wherever
Chinamen settle, respect f( r laws, civil, municipal,
and moral, la utterly banished never to returnee
long as the slant-tyed Celestial Is permitttd to
remain.

consistency. A piece shout the eize of a pea is
put on the end of a thin skewer (called the “yen
hcck”), about the size of, ann similar in appear-
ance to, a knitting-needle, at and then held over the
lamp, where it seethes aid n eits it to soitniss,
when it is put into the plp-e bowl. The pipe-stem
is about 20 Inches long, made of a heavy polished
word, and is nearly as thick as an ordinary broom-
stick. A bowl, in shape like a shallow cup. screws
into this about six inches from tbe end, tbe extra
space being ielt to increase the draught ob-
tainable. The cooked opium is pressed down
and peiforated with the yen hock, and then ihe
smoker, leaning so as to get the pipe-bowl over
the lamp, with a iew long breaths draws the
flame or beat on to the opium, and inhales tbe re-
sultant smoke, puffing it ont again through his
nosrrils Avery lew puffs suffice to exhaust the
more powerful constituents ot the dcse, ano when
no more fumes result, the devotee relaxes his
grasp of the pipe; It falls on the table, and he
turns over languidly and lays prone, with nerves
for a time pacified and at ease. He Is an interest-
ing though sac study. He has, perhaps, been smok-
ing daily for 10, or even 20, years, ano the ravages
of the habit are apparent in every visible mu*cie
and feature Tbe pupils of bis eyes are abnormally
dilated, and the eyeballs are covered with a thin
glassy coating, which effect .ally cl< abs any lustre
they may once have possesseo. His skin, in
appearance, resembles the bide of a beast, and
looks as though it were no longer nourished from
within; the outer muscles of bis neck are rigid,
and their course plainly traceable beneath the dry
skin enfolding them; his hands are those of a sun-
dried corpse, and his body is emaciated and en-
feebled to the last degree. To him the pipe is now
not even a pleasure. Once, so long ago that he
can hardly remember the period, opium lifted him
! up for a time from this world ot hard reality, to
an optimistic region a realm of rapture
where troubles were unknown, and all was
dreamy, languorous, sensu us satisfaction Then
the orug was a Jacob’s ladder, by means of wh oh
he could climb to a Nirvana of picturesque
romance, where pleasant Fancy ruled supreme
and Drought all the senses into subjection to
her will. But that period was too delightful to
endure for long. The poor weak nerves were dis-
tressed by the exertion of exalting the gross brain
to such unnatural e cstacy; they cried out for a
return of the strength taken trom them by
the fierce strain, the cruel task, which had
been Imposed upon them. ’) hey trembled
in their agony of weakness, and called with a
voice that could not be stifled for a return of the
Stimulant which had wrought so disastrously
upon them. Then relief was tried in newer doses
ol the drug, but this could no longer enable the
brain to soar to blissiul heights; it could only still
for a time those clamorous cries whiei would
arise with renewed and louder vehemence as soon
as the evanescent influence of the poison had
departed.
The wretched victim has endowed those nerves
with a raging passion which nothing but the
grave can fuliy satisfy, aud which oalv the in-
citer ot that passion can temporarily allay. Like
Frankenstein, he has raised a monster tor his
own irredeemanle torture; hb has planted
seven devils within his breast which res'
and tear him until he gives them the food
’bat strengthens them to torment and tear
him again with fiercer force He is like one
wh«, adrliton the open sea, drinka of the briny
waters to quench Mg thirst; the draught is no
sooner swallowed tbau the thirst breaks out afresh,
and with each draught rases the more until finally
it gathers a passionate strength against which >be
enfeebled brain vainly contends for mastery.
The powers of thew and of sinew have long since
departed; he is let t at last a pitiable reck, over-
whelmed with utter ruin of body, • ■blivious-o- all
moral obligations, and deprived of all nope and
even of reason Itself— i ay, worse, for the reason
given for his comfort and consolation has become
an agent of torture and anguish to him as long as
his life shall endure.
In writing thus we do not overlook two objec-
tions to such a statement of the ease. There are
some peisons who will assert opium smoking to
be harmless. It practised "in moderation ’-and wi h
“ oue precautions. ’ We admit this, but ask who
ever beard of these conditions being observed, in
Australia at any rate ? There is on this comment
no such thing as moderation in this indulgence,
and temperance in the same habit is equally un-
i known In America. We look at .-plum-smokersias
I they art, not as ihey would b« it they exercised <
I species of control which is foreign to their powers
; and the nature of their temptation. Either they
j use the drug immooerateJy or they avoid it alto-
get er—they know not this “moderation’ so
complacently advocated by arm-chair moralists
who have never been assailed by the fierce tor-
ment ol opium-hunger And again it may be
objected that it is possible to "knock it off ” alto-
gether It is possible in the case of those who
have only been smoking long enough to know the
delusive and disastrous delights which the pre-
liminary pipes afford, but with such there is no
desire to abandon the rapture when they know
not what hellish misery it entails. Even to them
fearful agony from abstinence Inevitably ensues.
The “yln-yans” supervene on a sudden depriva-
tion, and then every nerve In tbe whole body Isa
mocking, raging, agonising fiend, armed with in-
describable powers of torture. The subject tem-
porarily loses bis faculties and staggers blindly and
madly through tbe streets, unheeding because un-
knowing of eveiythlrg around him. Besson Is
dethroned Unnumbered demons hold high car-
nival and run riot through his entire system, and
the ordeal proves too dreadful to be endured
unless restraint comes from without and tbe drug
is withheld, Men In this state stop short of no
crime to obtain opium, and the Chinese, knowlrg
this, look upon one of their own countrymen, so
suffering, as a reckless thief, and therefore try to
leave him without opportunity. In ’Frisco, only a
month ago, a Mongolian In this state of frenzy
walked Into a chemist’s shop demanding opium
with the alternative of death is the penalty of
refusal. And Mr. Quotg Tart, of Sydney, will
testify that In China, if any property is stolen, it
can always be obtained at ihe opium-dens If some-
thing like its price is offered as a reward. Men
who talk calmly of the ability of tnoiphiniesto
renounce their habits, must consider these trail
victims to be mere machines and not creatures of
flesh and blooo, nerve and brain. Knock off

falling when be Is yet only half-way to the bottom
of a precipice; an obstacle interposed may pre-
vent bis retching tbe rocks of ruin at the bottom,
but nothing else can.
The opium-smoker Is rarely alone In tbe Indulg-
ence of bis vice, here is space for two on the
fable, srd tbe oiber place Is usually occupied-
occupied son etimes by a cead-broke and icckless
European, who can be made a uselul accomplice
In tf e numberless systems of swlndlii g which are
never absentlrcm those regions where Mongolians
“mist co congregate.” or else by the “tlcte
glrlee,” “llttee ginee,” whose presence and ap-
pearance put the finishing touches to tbe revolting
degradation of the scene. To tbe lowest depths of
depravity to which men may reach there is always
a lower depth attainable only by wemen, aud
whatever tbe vice be. its most revolting aspect is
seen when the weaker sex lend themselves to its
allurements, bo In this cate It Is poeslMe to
moralise overthe condition of tbe male debauchee,
but the mind carnet reflect calmly upm tbe ap-
pearai ce ot bis partner in rovolllrg practices.
There she lies,sucking In tbelumes of the diug.wltb
a degree oi dillget ce that betrays something akin
to insanity. Her dress Is negligent In the extreme,
ar and often not sufficient to satisly the oid nary re-
quirements ot decency. Her cheeks are hollow—
lomeiitnes devoid oi all colour and sometimes
n arkei wth a brand ot Mi ngolian yellow. Ke
gardiess of tbe presence ot strar gers, 1< st to the
re allty ano completes ss of her moral prostration,
unheeding ot duty, and utterly Indifferent con-
cerning her manliest destiny, she ci ntinues her
smoking until satiation ensues and brings brief
respite from tbe tortures by which she is
now ever oppressed Her powers for good in
this world are destroyed by a series of acts for
which she may not. after all, be much to blame.
Her capacity tor eijoyment of the many gifts of
the world is exhausted, she has sui kto an abyss
of loathsome and miserable sensuality which the
vilest beasts of the field are forbidden to attain,
and, just as the merciful man puts a dog, hope-
lessly smitten with painlui disease, out of bis
misery, so one could wish, In mercy s sake, to
bring quick deliverance to this hapless victim by
the aid of unerring lead or remorseless steel. Such
happy release would be murder only in the eyes of
tbe law. B< fore the God who rules the world, and
in tbe sight of those of His creatures who can
reason with unlettered and unprejudiced min ds,
the act would be its own and ample justification.
It is difficult for those who have never seen such
Sights to readse their existence, in the midst of a
wealthy, populous, and in many respects magnifi-
cent city. In George-s reet, Sydney, brilliant and
lavishly-appointed equipages roll along bearing
tbe possessors of lordly wealth; the “Block” Is
crowded wltharistocrxtlcand scrupu'ously-attlred
pedestrians; while hanks, shops, warehouses, and
churches of magnificent proportions and costly
design, eloquently testify to the wealth of their
possessors Yet almost within tbe shade ot these
edinces, within hearing of the rolling carriages,
and almost in view of those who flaunt their
respectability, riches, and beauty oo the block
there are lanes, slums, and alleys tenanted by
Chinese where the practice of immorality and the
worship of sensuality is reduced to a science and
systematically pursued There men and women,
drunk with the vhe abuse of a potent drug,
wallow in a sea of indescribable social crimes, yet
—worst shame of all—feel ana show no shame at
discovery. There are grades, even in the lowest
class. Marriage is said to exist in some eases, and
where no pretence is made of such a state, there
la often a distant resemblance, an abhorrent cari-
cature of domestic life
An instance which may be taken as a fair type
of one of these grades is found in the house of
in . [Note —The blanks h»re are
our tributes of respect t a brutal libel law ] The
front room upstairs is used as a bedroom, and as
tbe opium-pipe* are there, it is rarely left without
a tenant Commonly the scene may be desorb ed
thus. A low double-bed has its head to the front
wall, -nd on the opposite side a ragged celonia
sofa is Placed, the remain! g furniture consisting
ot a chest of drawers, old and dirty, and two or
three chairs Up >n the bed two girls, carelessly
dressed, recline. Both are cooking or smoking
opium. They are sisters; one is said to be
married to a Chinaman, the other to a European.
It is difficult to guess their ages, tor tnHr
faces are marred by the profligacy with which
they have wasted their powers. Each has a child,
a poor, shrivelled, weary-looking mite, which
seems to have tired of the brief view it has
had of the world. Breathing an atmosphere in
which all vile odours are blended with a marked
predominance in favour of opium: playing-it
they ever do play—with other children whose only
birthright is a heritage of vice, and accumulating
their vocabulary by collecting tbe wor- s uttered
by the voices of prostitutes, thieves, and
scoundrels ot every degree, their certain destiny
of misery seems already guaranteed. There la
only one chance of averting that doom; they
are vest and sickly; germs ot disease may
even now be doing their deadly work: the chil-
dren may soon die, and thus end lives that oa-i
only be a burden and a curse It is a sign ot sym-
pathy to wish them such a boon.
Upon the couch in the same room sits a bloated
ad bleary-eye<- old woman. She is said to be t e
mother of these tw • girls. With apparent uncon-
cern a> and lietl ss mann* r she looks at the two
wrecks opposite nor But the sight has probably
become a familiar one. She herself has evident!*
undergone some devastating dissipation which has
nulled her faculii- sand blunted her perception.
Presently the alleged husband enters the
ro m ; he is hideously ugly and searreo
by a f imer visitation ot snah-pox; his
eyes glitters with expectation and passion »s
heloors at the smokers and the pipes. He wlh
occupy a third place on t at c men, and tbe girls
win “cook nis opium for him and prepare his
pipe. He will then be ab-ut as mupy a» he knows
how. Any nosier species of enjoy ment would ne
incomprehensible to him as It w; uld be to his
female companions. \nd the old mother ? Sht-
srs passive, silent, and unconcerned, she shows
no emotion, sneos capable of node.
But a description of the Chinese quarter would
be incomoiete without an allusion to houses of toe
lowest class. Vue am jeets o»n o fly be describ ’d
by the aid of vile terms, therefore no apology
need be made, because the language is in accord
with the theme. To avoid the necessity of leaving
the ta-k unfinished, the worst specimens must be
held up to view; it isthe famt <>f the theme, not ot
the scribe, if tbe presentment is indelicate. There
are t'mes when obscenity must be looked upon,
and cryne described
While there are some of the Chinamen who
decoy white women to their dens, in order that,
they themselves may have consorts in crime, there
are othe.s to whom “Maly Ann” is merely a
source of revenue. The captivate European
woman is a mere chattel to such; there is no sen-
timent in the relationship, it is strictly commercial.
The joint enterprise of servant and master brings in
large profits, of which the Chinaman claims his
tuare— about 96 per cent usually, and the balance
is expended In providing opium and clothing for
the degraded Caucasian Phryne. High revels
often are held In those quiet-looking dwellings
perched up on the Bocks. Periodically the black
boys In service at pretentious villas and magnifi-
cent mansions in the suhurts, come into town and
assemble together, in one of these vile bouses of
resort. Then the signal of their advent is passed
from den to den, and the human stock-in-trade of
the Mongolian traffickers In depravity is collected
lor the entertainment of the visitors. The subse-
quent scene, even broadly described, could not be
printed, and even if printed, could not be read.
A few outline particulars give a dim idea
of the carnival. The house itself consists
only of four or five rooms, of which two are
furnished with beds or couches, and in these meagre
apartments from 15 to 80 of each sex are gathered.
At the back door stand two or three foul fiends in
Mongolian shape, the promoters of the festival,
the receivers of the resulting profits. They look
on with hideous complacency, as wreckers
might look on the wave-battered hulk of a ship
which they had drawn on to destruction,
and seem to be calculating the extent of the de-
moralisation they have Induced, and mentally
estimating its probable commercial value. This Is
the vtry deification of sensual vice. Every feature
tending to obsture or disguise the grossness of
immorality is removed; the surrounding* and
accompaniments are of the most repulsive
character. All is gross, foul, hideous, horrible, and
obscene. The drama is re-enacted on the nights
when men from the mall boats, or seamen trom
other ships elect to risk their goods, health, and
even lives in the pursuit of depravity. The same
moral tragedy Is then staged, the actors pile a
turther weight of guilt on the load they already
have to bear, ard the Mongolian manager exul-
tantly empties the treasury box, for the produc-
tion Is always for his benefit.
But these wretched Bahabs do not always stay
in Sydney. ’ heir considerate employers deem an
occasional change of air, frt m, say. the Bocks to
Botany, to be very beneficial. Change of scene
a solsgood. The eye wearies of continual obser-
vation of changeless streets, and then the eight of
a bed of cabbsges Is an immerse relief. Change of
companionship also is occasionally pleasant. And
the Chinese In suburban vegetable-farms are ex-
ceedingly hospitable; though there may he 20 of
them sleeping In one small room, “there Is room
for Mary there.” So Mary goes lor occasional
visits to a suburban cabbage-garden, for the
• tlquette tf the Bochs, as interpreted by her
n aster, does not admit of refusal oi so kind an in-
vitation. And a few pieces ot gold help to console
the kind master lor Mary’s absence. So hospitable
are some of the cabbage merchants that they
willingly pay for the privilege of ei teriaining
the miserable female pilgrims irom tbe “ Bochs.”
It is morbidly Interesting to go to those haunts,
in such localises as tbe “Suez Canal,” where the
dilapidated ones congregate when there are no
visitors to be entertained at the temples ot a dis-
gusting Venus. Ot adc zen of the women present
perhaps two or three are reputed to be what is
considered respectable and even “ toney ” on the
“Roots;” they live with alleged husbands, and
even aspire to some exclusiveness in the bestowal
of their affection. Two or three more, perhaps,
are real old “ Johnny Warders,” and the r> mainder
are undeniably and professedly traffickers in
shame. All, without a single exception, have
been In gaol for offences ranging from ‘ loitering”
aud “ righteous ” (for that In the “ buez Canal ” is
the received pronunciation of “riotous”) and
nearly all are opium-smokers. They have tasted
the drug, and no sense of shame is powerful
enough now to wean them from it It is the one
bond which holds them to men whom the most
degraoed of their class must detest, and scenes
which ihey must abhor. Were it not for tbe all-
powerful hop tuck, the opium-pipe, even reforma-
tion might tie possible, hut against Its influence
they are helpless. Various causes and circum-
stances have brought them to their present state.
Some have fl«d to the arms of their multitudinous
Mongolian admirers because of outraged and pur-
suing justice, and the present state of such is
cap ble of exciting hut little commiseration;
others have hidden here from offended husbands
aid angry parents, and the remainder have been
captured and seduced by means of that potent
bhy of Mongolian lust, the omnipotent opium-pipe.
The last-named class are the most numerous,
and ttelr misfortunes deserve the greater con-
sideration. It is difficult to arouse much com-
passion for those who have deliberately chosen-
even though the choice were made m a moment
of 1 dignation and anger-the habitations of the
Mongol. But the ease is different with those
who have, by their own thoughtlessness or inno-
cence, been made tbe victims of gross and criminal
treachery.
Degradation of the thoughtless or innocent
usually comes by slow degrees. It may be that
a vain girl in some tobacco or boot-factory
is in want of some finery, or even money, for an
approaching holiday. Emissaries of the Octopus
come to hear of the wish; they lead Miss Vanity
to an obliging Celestial, who lends her what dress-
stuff or petty cash she desires, and thus
opens an account against her in the ledger which
will subsequently contain the record ot her ruin.
The loan or money or goods is rarely repaid. The
emissaries of the Chinese creditor remind the
debtor of the obligation, aod force her to revisit
the den. If she is pliant to the w shes of the
debtor, and willing to minister to his pleasure, her
down-hill course is certain and rapid, but if virtue,
or even disinclination, bars the wav, the hop tuck
is called In to break down the barrier, and once
the pipe Is held to the lies the Rubicon is passed,
no retreat ia possible, and advance means inevit-
able destruction Thus the female European
population in the Chinese quarter is maintained,
nom*times mere school-children, promoted by
childish curiosity, wander round to those dens.
They look at toys and nick-nacks which are new
and strange. The Chinese, with calculating
ge-eroslty, give presents, which serve as an in-
citement to tmur- visits, and those visits lead to
the on y possible result when a lustful and un-
scrupulous Chinaman is one of the parties, an and an
unsuspecting, though perhaps instinctively cau-
tious girl, the other, Another recruit is sooner
or later added to the doneodan harem, the
list of tbe Australian criminal classe. r« ceives
another entry, and another innocent girl starts
with fearful velocity on the downward path which
ends only in death.
T Is is no fancy sketch. Girls can he seen In
that worst part of the Cnii ese quarter, who
but two or thr-e years since, were rightly
honoured by Living schoolfellows, and they are
familiarised with all the vices which accompany
«s a shadow tbe form of the Mongolian O ;topus.
One of the girls now kept in a den on the Bocks
s-iys of hers if, “ I went to ’ place woen 1

was a good girl before that. Look at me now,.
what am I ? ’ 1
Shall these things be continued ? Sha'l these
mobsters of sensuality grapple the youth ana
mnocence of Australia? Let this be answered
by agitation, by the popular voice and M-
fimching legislation So long as sensual Chinamen
»nd innocent girls are permitted to come into con-
tact, so long wtd the results be dlsas-rous to the
latter And as there will, we hop , he Innocent
girls to the end of time, the omy way to ob-
viate the evil is by forcible retrieval
toe remorseless agent of degradation, mo
Cni> amaa himself. The suckers -Vriieh trfus air
tack feminine frailty must" b'e cut therefrom
else the moral life and every enjoyment wnica
makes existence valuable or even endurable win
be drawn from tie welling veins of victims wno
atone for their sin with life-long an- irredeemable
suffering. To rescue the hapless girls who worn
, oti-erwise fall into tbe grip of the Mongolian octo-
pus is a sacred duty devolving upon every
Australian who has a sister, or a mother,.


But it must be done by legislation, and
the only legislation of any value whatever
must effect the absolute expulsion of the
Chinese Devil fish. So long as he remains, so
long also will this evil continue. Repression is
impossible ; if Chinese vices be penalised, they
will still continue to be practised, but greater
caution will be observed than now is customary,
and newer dodges will be resorted to In order to
effect seclusion.
Wnen the octopus of the ocean is pursued
or wounded, he glides into deeper and dark r
crevices, ejecting a cloud of ink to conceal
his hiding-place. Similarly the Mongolian Devil-
fish, if pursued by the police, or wounded by
legislation, will not cease from crime; he will
merely remove it back from its present location,
and obscure his movements by those devices with
which a long course of evasion and defiance of
the law has made him thoroughly familiar. The
existing causes must ever induce the present evil
elf acts,
A glance at the facts of the ease will
make this clear. There are in Sydney, say 2000
Chinamen who are not married, and never will
marry. They are not men who can occupy them-
selves in study, and the contemplation of
philosophy and virtue. They are beings without
any h'gher ideal than that based upon their own
passions; the gross pleasures of the body are their
one and only delight. And lastly, their lust
Is In most cases fed by the fierce stimulant of the
enslaving hop tuck. The degradation of others is,
therefore, an absolute necessity of their habits
nnd mode of life. And these habits are Incapable
of alteration. On this point a Californian, who is
thoroughly familiar with the history and habita-
tions of the Coinese la Aiherioa, forcibly writes in
the NOrthe&n miner (QTransport John
Chinaman to any ftart of the globe and he remains
John, Chlhaman to the tips of his taper fingers.
His dres \ laws, prejudices are dear to him as life,
or that symbol of Celestial citizenship, his pig-tail.
He Is as Incapable of any radical change la habit
as a mummy. Let him down in the Antipodes and
he lives as though under the shadow of Pekin’s
walls.” Even if the vile instincts of the Chinese
labourer were not unalterably fixed, his lack of
physical strength would still maintain him in his
Immorality. The labour of the Australian work-
man ii so valuable that its fruits sufiioe for the
support of a family in decency and moderate
comfort. But the weaker and stupid Chinese
cannot do the work of a white man, be-
cause he is Jacking in strength and intelli-
gence, and, therefore, must be content with
a smaller wage, upon which he cannot venture
upon marriage even if he desires to do so. It Is a
huge mistake to suppose that It is the greater
diligence of Chinamen which enables them to sup-
plant European labourers. The real truth is that
the Chinaman who can do say half the amount of
work of which his Christian competitor is capable,
will aocopt about one-third the wage of the other;
his labour is therefore absolutely cheaper. Work-
ing alongside an English navvy or mechanic, the
Mongol would be beaten out of sight, but as he
only wants sufficient money to support himself in
vice, while the other must earn enough to main-
tain himself and others in the methods of virtue,
the China nan can do the work more cheaply. Thus
because of his traditions, physical powers, and I
Intellectuality, tne average Mongol must neoes
sarily be a degraded creature. If the Legfslatur
could supply him with intellect, an eevatin
ideal, and increased strength of thew am
sinew, it might possibly deprive him of h:s
present absorbing desire to commit crimes whlc
every good citizen abhors, but so long as he has
that desire it will, despite all police control or re
strictive laws, be satiated by his own Oebasemen
and the utter ruin of others. Religion is equally In
efficient on this point. If the Mongol could appri -
elate any other god than his own sensuality, h s
inability, because of the insufficiency of his wage
to live as Christians do would prevent him from
following the commands of a higher law. Dot
the leopard changes his spots and the Bthlop hi
colour, the Mongols will continue to beau ulcer 1
fcao fait bosom of Australia. Expulsion, and ex
pulsion only, can meet the necessities of th
case, and to obtain the benefits arising from
this deliverance of the land from the gras*
of the Mongolian octopus we could view wit i
comparative unconcern the departure of sue i
estimable men and useful citizens as Mr. Quonr
Tart, Mr. Lee (of On Yik and Lee), wh
with perhaps half-a-dozen others of the sam
nationality, are worthy of a welcome in an l '
country under th® sun. But their conduet, excel-
lent though It may be lu every particular, only
serves to sho w In darker and more dlsgraoefu 1
colours the lamentable debasement, comprehen-
sive villainy, and disastrous vices of the wretched
horde of their fellow-countrymen who are spread
ing with ever-inoreasing rapidity over the terri-
tory of the Australian colonies.

Such are some of the features and results
of a Chinese camp or quarter, and the descrip-
tions and observations apply throughout Austra
lasia, wherever Chinese infest the land. We give
the facts generally, because details are disgusting

question of dealing with the Mongol invasion wll
have to be met by every Australian Legislature
And It will have to be met squarely, not evaded by
levying a poll-tax, as on the last occasion of its
Parliamentary debate. With the object of fur

“ We should be careful what Frankan-

gifted and gay editor of the Riverine (N.S.W.]
Grazier. We should be just as careful, Donald,
to have a notion, however dim, of what we are
writing about. It is a melancholy occupation to
go through the files of country and even metro*
poll tan papers and see how often this transparent
mistake about Frankenstein is male. Franken-
stein was not the name of the monster in Mrs.
Shelley’s book, but of the man who made the
monster. Yersatile leader-writers should make a

PEPPEA AND SALT.
The question of Antarctic exploration is
seraln coming to the front, and it ia proposed, If
money be forthco nlng, to despatch an expedition
from Melbourne to the froz n soutn. An
idea seems to prevail that somewhere behind the
great lee barrier may be found a community
afflicted with perpetual snuffles, but stlU far ad-
vanced in civilisation and Christianity and Im-
perial Federation, where an idole droops from the
frosty nose ef charity, and where landlords are
not, and every man dwells in peace and content-
ment on his own allotment of three icebergs and a
walrus. Down there it is, let .us hope, the An-
tarctic saint—the man who intones nasal texts and
shines in the Toung Men’s Benumbed Association,
and robs the snow-oover&d widow and orphan—
who Is walloped by the law, while the uneducated
ruffian ia set to shovelling snow; and within the
polar circle, at all events, the Chinaman has not
yet penetrated, and there is one sorrow the less.
Explorers will be spared the sight of a stiffened
Mongol running a fan-tan shop on top of a
glacier, and where the Intense cold of winter
makes it impossible even to toueh metal
no ice-bound deacon can pass the plate on Sun-
days and take up offertories of whale-oil for
benevolent purposes. There can be no tea-meet-
ings there, or no tea can grow, and when church
festivities are compelled to degenerate into blubber
and tallow scrambles, they are likely soon to die
away altogether. Even a municipal banquet wii 1
bo shorn of half its glory where the viands
would be restricted mainly to labiiee grease
dome day or other we may settte there ourselves
to pass our old age in peace, away from royal tes-
timonials and federation grovels, and at last we
may sleep the sleep of the Just with a snowball for
our eternal pillow, and a li ih-bone stuck up above
us to mark our resting-place.

Tli® “ social purity” maggot is eating away
the heart of Ballarat. The local Crookses and
Walkers have discovered that gambling is carried
on in private houses. A parson has been writing
to the papers on that congenial olerloal topic—1m.
morality. Two old maids, talking scandal at a
street corner, distinctly heard a young man make
use of a gigantic D. As the result of all this, the
worthy city mayor was reluctantly compelled to
call a public meeting “to see what was heat to be
done.” Ye gods! If spirits were permitted to
walk this earth, there must certainly have been
motions at that Bal arat meeting. Shades of in-
dignant dead “Identities” would have carried tbe
platform by assault and pelted the speakers with
tombstones. Wethinks tney are hovering around
us as we sing:—
In Auckland (N.Z.) lives a good and pious
man, whose name Is suggestive of 80 per shent.,
with the bill falling duo somewhere in the Valley
of the Jordan. His occupation is chiefly money*
lending and prayer, and he retires from his
“sweating-room” for an hour daily to engage in
private devotion. Recently he was visited by an
impecunious child of wrath, who wished to raise
money on mortgage, and after a brief discussion*
the man with the snuffle spake thus:-“ I never do
anything without laying the matter be f ore the
Loard. Come back at 2 o’clock, and peradventure
I may be able to acoom odate you ” At 2 o'clock
therefore, the unconverted man returned, the In-
terval'having been spent presumably in laying
the title deeds before the throne of grace,
and the good and pious per shenter said
with a long and saintly sml e: “ Well. I laid your
application before the Loard, and the security
being all right, I think I may accede to your re-
quest.” ‘‘On what terms?” was the next ques-
tion. “Well,” said the pious man with another
smile, “the times are hard and money is tight.
Suppose we say 20 per cent, for 12 months'” The
borrower only waited to ask If “the Loard ’•
hadn’t said 25 per cent. Instead of 20, and to
remark that the pious man might go back to his
native haunts In the suburbs of Bethlehem, and
then left. He Is reported since to have raised the
necessary sum off a Chinaman who doesn't consult
his stuffed Joes In business hours.

Our old and reverend acquaintance, Mr.
Hensley, formerly editor of the Melbourne War
Cry, has sounded a new alarm In the Sunday
Magazine. He says: “ The perverted taste for
lollipops, caused chiefly (because not prevented)
by mothers, is a large—very large—cause of
Juvenile crime.” This must be seen to. Elizabeth
Barrett Browning has pleaded eloquently for the
luckless Juvenile drudges of the faototy and the
mine
Do you hear the Children weeping, 6 my brothers,
fire the Sorrow comes with years ?
They are leaning their young heads against their
mothers,
And that cannot stop their tears.
The young lambs are bleating in the meadows,
The young birds are chirping in the nest,
The young fawns are playing with the shadows,
The young flowers are blowing towards the
west;
But the young, young children, O my brothers,
They are weeping bitterly 1
They are weeping in the playtime of the others,
In the country of the free.
They look up with their pale and sunken faces.
And their looks are sad to see,
For the man’s hoary anguish draws and presses
Down the cheeks of Infancy.
Mrs. Browning sleeps the sleep of the great, but
surely there is someone willing to twang a lyre
for those other poor children, whose souls are
being slain with kindness, In many a so-called
Christian home. Dp, bards, and at ’emJ Take
lodgings opposite a lolly-shop, watch the little
Inno ents toddling in to their dooms, and then
throw off a set of verses which Shall shake the
world. Tnis might do for a start;—
Do you ftie the children sucking, O my brothers,
fire tne sorrow comes with years ?
They have been and got a penny from their
mothers—
Poor, misguided little dears 1
The young lambs are served with new pertaters,
The young birds are made into a pie.
The young fawns are handed round by waiters,
The young flowers are “buttonholed ’’ to die;
But the young, young children, O my ferotherk,
They are Buckinglollipops!
They have purchased 'em (per favour of their
fflothers)
v From the damsels In the shots,
they look now, with Bid distorted faces,
At the tempting acid-drops—
Bfft theV’ll drink, and swear, and gamble at the
races
When they’ve done with lollipops.
The Tow and Country Journal’s London
aristocrat is to the fore again under a new degig
nation. She commenced her wild career simply as
a “ Bsereas,” then she appeared as the daughter of
a “Beer," a;.d, Judging from her letter.lt oer
talnly teemed as if she had been drinking her malt
parent, and now she figures as the misguided pro-
geny of a “Juke,” Undoubtedly it is a nice thing
lor a Sydney paper to have a high class female
like this on the premises-lt keeps the flies away,
and lends an air of distinction to the place, but it
would certainly be better if her status were a
little better defined. Next week we fully expect
to hear of her as “the aunt of a Mormon,”
or the sister-in-law of K1 Jabtz Abdul Smith,
Emir of some mud flat in Tartary, and when
it comes to that, the Gxtmtrbe's peeress will
probably be consigned to tae eternal dust-bio,
and a greasy cannibal hired in her stead. Her
latest subject is the Princess of Wa-es, whom she
defines in one place as a “soared sphinx”—her
alarmed expression being ascribed by many to
her dread of her atout jubilee mother-in-law— and
the “ Beeress ” dwells sadly on the time when she
used to make her own bonnets, and button her
own boots. This last remark refers, of course, to
the Princess, for the “ Bteress,” we befleve, not
only buttons her own boots, but brushes them as
well, and has occasionally to shine the hoof-boxes
or tde parental duke into the bargain, while the
duchess fries the sausages for breakfast, and spanks
the ditty little marquis who Is chasing round
the ducal cat. Tne Queen, we learn, looked at the
Princess's marriage through a hole In the wall
and also Wept through the hole, though why she
did not come out and weep all round the church
and the altar it Is difficult to comprehend, fea-
sibly her Majesty originally Intended to bOrhe tight
through the hole, ahd thlis join the frarty, put
being sombwhat adipose stuck midway, and was
compelled, therefore, to weep with her head In-
side the building and her feet in the vestry, but
this la not accurately explained. The Princess, It is
stated, is seen and not heard, In which respect she
differs from the “ Beeress,” who Is heard very
much, hut who, If we may judge from her earlier
letters. Is not fit to be seen. Neither is she fit to
be read, for when not Indecent she Is prosy, and
when not prosy she smells of Chinatown, but It 18
possible that when she gets on to the Duke of
Marlborough and Lord Lonsdale she may Improve
a bit.

FIFTY-SIX AND EIGHTY-SIX
la the Ballarat of old.
When the diggers, strong and bold.
Threw up shining CtiunKs of gold
Oat of holes.
With pick and spade they wrought
All the day, as Britons ought—
But they never gave a thought
To their souls.
They’d a code of morals then.
Had those sturdy digger men—
Dick, Jack, and Bill, and Ben—
Of a kind;
A ready code, and rough,
But it did ’e'rft well enough
(They were made of sterling stair,
Bear ia mind).
Deuce a bit did diggers care
For the incidental “swear,*’
Of a comrade who was * square ”
In his deals:
And they deemed it out of place
It a fellow had the face
To Interpolate a “ grace ”
At his meals.
Ben, Dick, and Bill, and Jack
Shuffled each a euchre pack
(Somewhat greasy at the back),
Bvery night;
And, if fortune proved unkind,
Well, they really didn’t mind,
For another lucky find
Put ’em right.
No distinctions then of rank,
As they played, and swore, and drank
In a manner free and frank,
To be sure;
Ah I a happy, cheery lot,
Never earing, e’er a Jot,
If their fellow-man was not
Very “ pure.’’
But the modern Ballarat,
It is different to that,
Many parsons smug and fat
There abound;
While the diggers, strong and bold,
Of the roaring days of old—
A lot of them lie cold
In the ground.
There is humbug in the air;
Ohadband offers up a prayer
For the naughty boys who swear,
Drink, and dice;
It isn’t safe to “ shout ”
A whisky or a stout—
Someone’s foxing round about
After vice.
Oh! the jolly days of yore,
And the diggers gone before,
We shall never see them more™
No, bedad!
They have gone and given place
To another time and race,
Which are (pardon our grimace)
Twice as bad.

For a lady to exhibit there's no need to advertise,
When nearly all there Is of them la patent to the
eyes;
The little dears themselves take care the lesson to
impress,
That the very higheet circles wear the very lowest
dress.
The ballet-girls who dance for coin their petticoats
curtail,
And “ ladles ” bare the other end to captivate the
male;
The first display their hose upon the stage because
they must,
While those go to the next extreme and show
their arms and bust.
There’s very little difference, that m see, any
way,
Between the means adopted their attractions to
display (
While one outs short her skirts to dance, the gl 1
whose blood is blue
Achieves a like result, but has another end in view.
Yet all of them exhibit, some show more and some
show less,
But all show all they have to show, whichever way
they dress—
Or undress—would be possibly a somewhat better
term;
Ah I May the custom linger till we’re old and quite
infirm.
THE CHARGE OF ILLAWARRA.
“ On iTrid&y, fi'a a party of light
horse were cantering sharply down Castlereagh-
Street, Sydney, they came Into collision with a tip-
jCart, and one of the cavalry men received a severe
fall.”
From the fields of Illawarra,
From the oily butter city.
Where the maidens are ail milkmaids
And the younir men are all milkers—
Straight of hair with curly noses,
Came the Illawarra horsemen
To the big smoke bydnoy city.
And they knocked the city bandy,
Made it howl with pure amesementj
Hiding on their fiery horses
Through the crowded Sydney city t
Said they ” We will show these jokers
How it's done in tilawarra.’ ’
80 they raced down Castlereagh-street
Hike the whirlwinds down the ihountaib,
And they madfe the people shatter
Till they reached the fa'al cornet
Whete the fell and stealthy tip-cart,
Ton-up-Hruitt-street the tip-carL
Lay in ambush waiting for thenu
Then the btaVest of the hoiSemen,
He thb pride of Illawarra,
tfelt his dander rise within him;
He bethought him of the milkmaids
And his native pats of butter;
And he spoke in words herblc-
Ho v shall I face 11 into and kindred
If I let a tip-Cart best file ?
Shall I live ;6r then to hiss me ?
And the cheery, saucy milkmaids
As I pass will turn and giggle—
‘ There’s the man that funked a tip cart I ’ ”
So he spurred his fiery courser.
And he charged the deadly tip-oirt—
Bucked right at it with his ears back,
Met it full with fierce collision.
But the sturdy foe, the tip-dray.
Never even winked an eyelid—
Didn’t seem to care a button;
And the pride of Illawarra,
From his saddle flying skywards—
Like a comet in the noonday,
Stood upon his head on nothing
In the air for half a minute.
For the space of half a minute,
Like the coffin of Mahomet,
’Twlxt the earth and sky suspended,
Just to show the Sydney puolio
How It’s done in Illawarra.
And the public wondered greatly;
Said, “ Here goes a blazing buster.”
Wbile they uttered th ir amazement.
To descend he condescended,
On the pavement hard aDgnted,
Like a bag of new potatoes
Dropping from an attic window;
And he found the pavement cosy,
So he lay there as in slumoer.
But his comrades brought his charger.
And he rapidly ;e-mounted—
Mounted on his fler® charger.
And he passed on down the roadway
Like a postman round the corner
With hlo red and dusty jacket,
While the oub ic stood in wonder;
And the stern, unconquered tip-cray.
To its stables roiled triumphant.
And the men from Iliawaira
Gave the citizens a respite—
Didn’t knock them quite so bandy.
And the man that charged the tip-dray
As a sadder liler-warrior, * '*
Has gone back to Illawarra,

A tety fashionable wedding took place at
Sydney, nn Wednesday afternoon,
the llth lost., when Mr Vernon Cotton, man-g-v
Oi the Bmk of N.S.W ; Sedhr-, was married 10 Miss
Ethel Shepherd Smith, third daughter of Mr
Bhephctd Smith, gtfieral fflanaget or the Bank of
N.S.W. The church was beautifully decorated
with white flowers of every description, inter-
spersed with quantities of gteen, and was crowded
With gueslS and spehtatefa. Precisely at half-
paSt two, the ChorlsterS matched up the a sle,
Singing an appropriate hymn, and then the
btlde followed with her fai her to the altar-rails,
whore the bridegroom and his best man, Mr.
Stuart Cotton, were in readiness. The Rev.
Tnojpoas Kemmls, assisted by ihe Bevs Jack-
son and Bailey, performed the ceremony. The bride
looked extrfemely graceful in a handsome Ivory-
Satin gown made with a long colirt train and pro-
fusely trimmed with valuable lace and orange-
blossoms; a pr«ttily-arr»nged wreath of orange-
blossoms ornamented the hair, and a long soft
tulle veil completed the costume. The bride’s six
sisters attended as bridesmaids, and were dressed
In pretty soft white silk, with front tabller of
lace, large becoming white bats with clusters of
feathers at one side. The groomsmen were Mr.
Bayes Cotton, Mr. Lester Smith, Mr. Bowden, and
Mr. Nyberg. ;The bride carried a magnificent
bouquet of white camellias, snowdrops, and
maidenhair ferns, while the bridesmaids each bad
pretty little horsehair wi 6 tbs Composed ot the
same flowers. Having left the vestry to tbe
strains of the widd rg ■ maicb, the bridal
party drove to the Bang of N.3.W., whme
they breaklasted, and alter speeches and toasts,
and general rejoicings, Mr. aru Mrs Cotton
took their departure, amidst pretty slippers and
showers of rice, for Moss Va’e where the honey-
moon is to be spent The bride's travelling dress
Was very handsome and becoming, composed of
dark- blue casbihere, wjth.the same coloured panels
afad tabller, high hat with white leather in front
She also wore a long brown boa. The presents
were very numerous and costly.

On 13tlx inst., the last of the St. Leonards’
private subscription dances was held at the local
adorned Masonic Hall. An unusual number
bf pretty, fresh looking dresses were worn
on this occasion, the most noticeable being
a crimson tulle, with bows and knots of
black velvet. A cream satia, profusely trimmed
with the same coloured lace, was worn by a
tall, stylish-looking girl from North Shore.
A married lady was admired in a handsome gown
of pale-blue mervelileux, with draperies of the
same coloured tulle, and bunches of pearls sewn
over the dress, which made a very pretty effect. An
elaborate toilette was eau-de-ml satin, with tab-
ller of white-cut beads, low bodice, finished off
with the same trimming.

His Excellency and Lady Carington in-
spected the N.S.W. Cavalry on the 13th inst. at
Moore Park. The whole affair was a most deplor-
able fianca. First of all, there “ warn tno
Cavalry 1 if you leave out the officers and aoout
Six drummers. This omistl n was found to be the
cause of some natural embarrassment on the p,rt
of H.E. It is true he repressed a look of disgust,
and rode quiie solemnly “up the line.” but as the
line was not much longer than a nantl of fencing,
he soon came to tbe etd of if. Then tho Cavalry
turned “right, about’’ and gave H E. a back vie *
—the view was broader but not longer than before
—and in about two skips he had seen all he could
see of the N S.W. “ Cavalry.’’ Some miliary
“ evolutions ” then took place, and the gallant
fellows formed as many “fours ’ as eight men
and an odd ore can form. The odd one then
became a hollow square through which the vice-
regal party galloped in disgust, and then got
home and did some real soldiering by putting the
Government House sentry through some “Autumn
mac oeuvres.”
Two hundred
guests attended a
very successful
dance given on llth
inst,, at Sydney
Town Hall by the
Tarbolton Masonic
lodge. Among the
most noticeable of
the handsome cos-
tumes worn ware a
white merino trim-
med with old gold,
plush petticoat of old
gold, and bows to
correpond. A con-
spicuous dress was
pale-pink satin
draped with cream
lace and bands of
black velvet round
the skirt; a pretty
dress was white lace
with draperies ©f
pale-blue satin mer-
veilleux; an admired
costume whs white
ciDpe de chine with
electric-blue feath-
ers and bows; ditto
a navy-blue satin
with handsome gold
embroidered iront; a stylish gown was rich white
embossed silk with long narrow panels of bright
red silk, the low bodice being finished off with red
tulle.

Lady Carington has consented to open the
Manly Flower 'how on September Bth. If her
lanysnlp only knew it she has an opportunity of
doing good, by refusing to be present, that she
will perhaps never get again. Sydney for miles
round has oeen stripped of flowers, and in another
year there will not oe a wild flower left. But then,
of course, we’ll have instead a few snug par-
sonages for the priests of the Creator of flowers to
lounge in.

What, after all, is fame? Lord Carington
must be worried to supply an answer to this
gloomy conundrum, for upon a recent visit to a
football jubilee on the Sydney Association Ground
he was actually bailed up and asked to produce
his pasteboard just like any ordinary commoner.
Is it, then, altogether In vain that his Excellency
has patronised everytaiog from triplets to pleurisy

would seem so.

We read that Mr. Dan. Cooper, or Sydney,

and necklace of diamonds and peiris, a diamond
ornament in the form of a orescent, and two
braoelets-one of diamonds and the other of dla*
moods and sapphires.” We also read that at a
recent reception of Lady Cooper’s, mother of
Daniel aforesaid, “the supper was on the most
princely scale, and the peacnes were magnificent.”
Perhaps the peaches wouldn’t have been quite so
magnificent if an absentee-tax existed in N.S.W.

The N.S.W. cavalry tournament-day was,
taken all in all, a success-and so it should have
been, as it had been talked of and praotlsed for for
four months. As an exhibition of military skill, it
can hardly count for much, as cutting off wooden
heads, and sticking spears into planking cannot
be accepted as thorougnly conclusive proofs of
military prowess. The day was splendid, .and the
only fault found with the show by those who paid
to see it, was that too much was given for the
money; the spectators would have oeen satisfied
with at least an hour’s less glory. The Nelson and
second Brigade bands played admirably, but the
crowd was so denseithat there was little promen-
ading; as a consequence, the ladies took them
to seats, and the seats returned the compliment by
taking to them. For the seats were covered with
adhesive paint, which cemented the ladles to the
boards. As a consequence, the appearance pre-
sented by the fair ones when they did get
divorced and began to do the lawn, was
gloomy in the extreme-lf you looked at them
when they turned their faces away. One episode of
the day was funny. A “ horrid paper ” had alleged
that Lord Carington had said the Sydney Lanoeabs
“ couldn’t ride.” Blood or an apology from H.E.
could alone wipe this out. His lordship chose the
latter and went for an “ alibi ’’—declared he’d
never said so—all he had said was, “As for your
riding, gentlemen, it is enough to say you are
Australians.” And it was quite enough—they’ll
never ask for an apology again. Probably no one
present knew all that was going on upon the
ground, for in some cases several events occurred
simultaneously, while various of the “ manoeuvres ’
took place almost out of one s eyesight. The tug-
of-war was the “show” of the piece, hat the
Bi>yal Marines won is a fact, but the Mlttagong
boys pulieo splendidly and took their beating—

In these days of musole-worship, it is pleas-

native genius, in little Elsie Hall, a child of nine
years of age, Sydney has something to be proud
of. We do not, as a rule, care for the “ infant
prodigy.” Generally the “infant” Is far older
than the posters declare, and not half so remark-
able. We have even known oases of “ prodigies”
of 16 dressed up to look like 13—and this not so

lately. But we believe Elsie Hall really Is nine—
and we know that »he has a remarkable genius. On
Saturday night Herr Kreitohmann gave an oppor-
tunity of hearing the child at a private concert
given by him. Tne performance was wonderful,
the little girl playing pieces that have defied the
skill of many first-rate professionals. She played
wholly from memory, and ooiefly classical pieces.
If this child Is not unnaturally “ forced,” we may
hear of her as a female Rubenstein.

Queen "Victoria is trying to buy up all the
copies of a recent work entitled “ Romance of a
German Court.” It is said to be written by the
Grand Duchess Serge, a lady who is herself
“ royal,” so she thoroughly understands the hum-
bug of the whale thing. Referring to Princess
Beatrice’s marriage with young Bat, says the
lady:— ’’ Beyond him could be espied young Serge
de Pattenpouf, who, having dissipated tho little
cash his parents could give him, was over head
and ears In debt. His hope of the future remained
firm, for it rested on an intrigue, still but an
embryo In his mother’s brain—an intrigue which
would some day place In the heavy lieutenant of
Hussars’ paw the red, plump, gnd gold-lined hand
of Princess Oorysande, the last daughter of the
Queen of the Orient. He and bis mamma, expect-
ing everything from the weariness and disco urage-
ment felt bv the Princess at the continual failures
attendant on her efforts to catch some royal Prince
or other on the win?, hoped to induce her to de-
scend as many rungs of the social ladder as would
place her on a level with the Pattenpoufs.”

ROWLAND S' OOONTO is the best, purest
and most fragrant preparation for the teeth.
Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes
nor pastes can possibly be as efficacious for polish-
ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non-gritty tooth powder; such
Rowlands’ Odonto has always proved itself to be.
ROWLANDS EUKONIA is a beautifully
pure, delicate, and fragrant toilet nowder, and
has lately been much improved. Each box has
Inside the lid a certificate of purity from Dr.
Redwood, Ph D. f F.C.8., &o. Sold in three tints :
white, rose, and cream.
ROWLANDS’ MACASSAR OIL can now
be also had in a golden colour, which is especially
suites for fair or golden-haired children and per-
sons. Four sizes.
Ask any dealer in perfumery for Rowlands’
article*, of 20 Hatton Garden, London, and avoid
spurious worthless imitations.

Carnrick’s Cod Liver Oil S life
PEPTONISED (DIGESTED.)
Highly recommended by the Medical Profession throughout ibe world as being
the best remedy for Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Scrofula, Wasting
D iseases, Consumption, General Debility, over-taxed brains, &0., (fee.
It will produce an immediate gain iu flesh and strength.
Can be taken when all other forms of Cod Liver Oil ar > refused.
It contains about equal parts of the best Norwegian Cod Liver Oil and concen-
trated fresh milk, both peptonised (digested).
The peptonised milk disguises the unpleasant taste and smell of the oil. and
t i m^ kes i4i aa sweet as cream ; very palatable and most nourishing.
Invaluable for children, and will agree with the most delicate persons, causing
no return or unpleasantness.
One trial will satisfy anyone of the great value of this new and unique pre-
paration.
The reconstructive or nutritive properties are five times greater than the
,P lai noil or any Other Emulsion, hence it is much cheaper.
■both the Oil and the Milk being digested, the whole will assimilate, whereas
in Cod Liver Oil and other Emulsions (being undigested) only a small
proportion is of any value. It is the most Toerfect Emulsion ever
made, and the only one of digested Cod Liver Oil and Milk.
Analysed and recommended by the first Professors in Europe.
We also manufacture the above preparation combined with Hypophosphitea
of Lime and Soda. SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS.

Carnrick’s Soluble Food for Infants, Invalids,
and Aged Persons, is the most nutritious, palatable, and easily-digested Infant’s
Food ever manufactured, containing fifty per cent, ofthesolids of milk (digested)
and fifty per cent, of the finest wheat, converted into soluble form.
A most perfect food. The nearest approach to Mother’s Milk ever made.
It is unequalled for the formation of fat, flesh, and bone, and increasing
the vital forces SO necessary to health.
Specially recommended in cases of Marasmus, Diarrhoea, and Cholera
Infantum, and where the digestion is defective.
Children fed upon cereals or cow’s milk alone very often remain weak, and
suffer from softening of the bones, and when attacked by infantile dis-
orders are unable to resist the inroads of disease.
“OARNRICK’S SOLUBLE FOOD’’ is invaluable for Invalids
and Aged Persons (who cannot digest farinaceous food), as it is rich
in nutritive and easily-digested albumenoids, thus increasing both flesh
and strength, and restoring the vital forces.
It IS most convenient for use, being in a powdered form, and will keep indefinitely.
When boiled and stirred for three minutes it is ready for immediate use.

Few people are aware of the alarming 1 prevalence of
Kidney and Liver diseases, especially among those who
have arrived at or are past middle age. Undeclared
on good authority that fully one-half the deaths m
this country aie -itlier directly or indirCvtii the
result of Kidney or Liver disease of some sort.
A great majority of men above 40 years of age are
afflicted with some sort of affection of tke Kidneys or
Bladder, and these diseases are on the increase I’m -
sons are often seriously affected before they know of
it themselves, and tuus these insidious disorders get a
good foothold before anything is done to dislodge
them.
Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, Bright’s Disease, Incon-
tinence, Debility, Catarrh of the Bladder, Albu-
menuria, Ike., are among the many forms of these
diseases. Most of these are very difficult to cure,
defj’tng the powers oftentimes of the best physicians
obtainable, and are pronounced by many to be
incurable.
Physicians state that many forms of Kidney and
Liver disease are very difficult to detect, as in diseases
of this form oftentimes there are no symptsms of a
marked nature. This is one of the reasons why they
are so difficult to cure.
Dr. BELL’S (Kidney and Liver Bitters) is a Specific
for Kidney and Liver troubles, Bladder and Urinary
Diseases, Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, and all of
class of disorders.
It cures Biliousness, Headache, Jaundice, Liver
and stomach troubles, Dyspepsia, Constipation, and
Piles.
It cures Intemperance, Nervous Diseases, General
Debility, Female Weaknesses and Excesses.
It is thoroughly reliable, highly recommended,
works promptly, relieves at once, and was never
known to fail.

an Hong, Chinaman, recently buried at
BomD.ta, u»d coin; oons< queutly he was much

to the grave b,' m,ny local residents. As 1 ■ Is
stated that ihe Church or England burial-service
was ie ,d by a whi e> clergyman ov r *h H.mg «
remains, we conclude that tee lamented Mongolian
gentleman was of the Anglican persuasion. How-
ever, there appear to have been one or two cere-
monies in connection with the “ planting” of Ah
Hong which we understand to be distinctly non-
Anglican. For Instance, a sovereign was placed in
the dead Chinaman’s mouth, and the poor clay -
fire clay, let us hope—of Ah Hong was attired in
two suits of clothes and sent off. bridal fashion,
with a shower of rice. The question thus arises.
wu*t was Ah Hong ? Was he ap ordinary heathen
r a member of the Church of England? It the
litter, the sovereign, clothes, and rice business
was cit,arly superfluous; it the lorroer, then we
are entitled to argue that the C of B burial-
service was wrongfully read over a watl-e>ea
pagan. However, we congratulate the Anglican
ci rgy on their growing liberality, and we antici-
pate with much pleasure the fast approaching time

The contempt expressed for Graham Berry
in the hour of his knighthood is not lessened, now
that the true story of the ex-demagogue s degra
datlon is to hand. The modest old gentleman told
his toadies that he “ felt it impossible to refuse
the honour” because it was conferred unex-
pectedly ” and for “ valuable services In connec-
tion with the Exhibition.” The explanation is a
o umsy attempt to mollify old adherents. Every-
one Interested knows that Graham s services at
Kensington were nil, as he never arrived In Lon-
pon till the Victorian Commissioner had oonipleted
the work. Why even his personal application to
be included on the commission was curtly refused.
And to say that the bauble was unexpected was a
piece of unparalleled effrontery. The removal of
Mr. Murray Smith from the Agent-Generalship in
favour of Graham Berry was a carefully-planned
job, foreshadowed when the salary hanging to the
office was increased by £5OO. One poor excuse has
the Victorian political Judas for his crime. The
first notification of the title arrived In tbe form of
a congratulatory telegram to Mrs, Berry. Now,
when a delighted wife flings her arms round a
husband’s neck;, and calls him a “ dear old man,
he may fairly protest that he -is yielding to pres-
sure. The present Lady Berry experienced no
qualms of conscience on reading tnat telegram.
She never o ried, “ Pack off the Governor, An

official sources, and published in a pamphlet en-
titled "Tno Bishops and their Wealth.’ by the
Rev. Mercer Davies. M.A., afford a bitter satire on
the “ Christianity ” of the “ swells” of the Anglican
Church. From the year 1856 to the.close of 1885, 39
Anglican bishops died In England. On an average,
each left behind him a fortune of about £74,000, or
a total of over two millions for the 39, exclusive
of any real estate they may have possessed, and
exclusive also of any sums of money Invested In
policies of life assurance, that may have been
settled for thebenedt of their lamilles. Here Is

The Wallsend and Plattsburg (N.8. W.)8xjn
starts a leading-artlole-in every way worthy of
the subject—on the town band, thus:—" The resi-
dents of Wallsend and Plattsburg are now brought
face to face with the existence or non-existence of
a town band.”
At Mittagong (N.8.W.), Arthur Oorrie has
been sent up for three months for fooling round
with a revolver. For the defence, his sister swore
that he us 3d the weapon only for shooting wal-
labies, being in the habit of chasing these animals
on a bicycle. Corrie’slast difficulty was a £30 fine
for not hitting some one of his own size, or, as It
was generally termed, for a brutal assault oh a
child.
The Melbourne Herald has been re-
moved from a pig-stye into a palace. There is no
mistake about this assertion. The ‘‘office’ in
was probably the dirtiest in the
wide world. But they have changed all that.
The new office is as sweet as the old was
sour—as cle*n as the other was foul. Every
thing Is epic and span. The festive dun is
not allowed to harass the literary men up
s airs Toe fiendish boys who, under the old regime,
rendered life not worth living to the reporters, cave
been banished from the realms of thought and
criticism. Clean linen is now the rule— en reg
ai Winter oms It. There is a decent sobriety
about the new offices which awes and subdues the
three halfpenny a liner. Naturally the journal
itself is coloured by this refor e. It is now
eminently decent. A dead level of propriety
marks its literature. Even the slap-dash sabreur
who writes the leaders has modified his ‘‘ swank,
and an attempt has been made to substitute intel-
ligibility for gibberish. Altogether the Herald
has gone through the mysterious process among
Evangelists as “ new birth.”

Judge Docker seems to be hurt by the
comments on Berner’s ten-yenr sentsnoe. and re-
nlies that “ Judges were not made by machinery.
Of course they were not. No machine ever known
could manufacture a N.B.W, Judge,

A fastidious man who has to travel from
Wlloannla to Hay (N.B W.) by coach should, before
starting, commit a crime if he wishes to be com-
fortable. Six manacled prisoners were brought
down to the coach, not long ago, and booked for
Hay. The respectable inside passengers had to
get out and ascend to the roof. The rain imme-
diately came down In a thundering deluge and the
unhappy passengers got wet to the marro w while
the cheerful criminals inside were lapped in luxu-
rious warmth and dryness. Some of those passen-
gers have since been laid up with rheumatism and
corpse-making colds, but the system still go®*
merrily on. It Is hard fora stranger to under-
stand, but, as a matter of fact, a man is considered
of not much account in the country west of Hay
if he has not committed one or two highway rob-
beries, or, at least, stolen a team of horses.
*' j.W.8.” in the Sydney D.T., suggests
that the N.B.W. Centenary should be celebrated by
the abolition of lawyers. This would, of course.
Include Coonan, and the suggestion Is the best we
have heard since last Jubilee. In the N.Z. Parlia-
ment one of the native members plaintively asked
Sir George Grey if he could not introduce a bill to
make lawyers nonest, and the veteran Knight of
Kawau said with a sigh that the Devil himself
could not do that. A bill largeenough to produce
such an effect would extend right across the
country, " Victoria, by the grace of God,’ being
somewhere up In Auckland, while the tail of the
document with his Excellency’s signature, would
drift across the Beefton goldfield, and the whole
measure would have to be passed through the
House in abullook-dray. Then the Maori sat down
with a heathen remark which sounded like an
alligator falling Into a hot spring.
Salvation Harmy hoffleers were telling
yarns one against the other at the Melbourne
Council of War. The amount of Harmy suffering
w nich these narratives disclosed was very oonsld et-
able. some of the poor evangelists have been re-
stricted, it seems, to two pounds of steak and a
quartern loaf for a daily allowance of food- Others
have had to do “ hard work” (yes, dear friends) In
order to make both enoa meet. But no matter to
what straits they were reduced, the Board naa
always popped in an opportune miracle. A »outn
AUftraiUn esptimr told a beautiful storyiabout hla
little barefooted boy. The child, cetat three T®* l *
and six months, “ prayed for a pair of boots, and
by the time he arrived at “amen the boots were
hanging on the outside door-handle. As a sajEPf®
of Divine attention, we would mention that the
Lord knew the little fellow’s fit exactly,” Wed
not he surprised if the Deity had the father s mea-
sure, also.
