The Red Page
America and Art
“I have great faith in the American people as the
future leaders of civilisation, but that cannot be for
another 35 or 40 years. At present they are too
engrossed with their own mechanical commercial
development. They are rapidly reaching the climax
of this development—a marvellous, stupendous thing
—and then they will turn to other things. With
the same thoroughness, initiative, and youthful assur-
ance with which they conquered the material world,
they will tackle poetry, literature, music, and give the
world the greatest art of all times. Those who
accuse America of being- inartistic are devoid of
imagination. America is working out her artistic
consciousness. You have there two distinct tendencies :
your simplicity, refreshing childishness, almost primi-
tiveness in all things emotional, and your ultra-
modemity in the mechanical fields. Consider a fusion
of these two elements. What a startling combination i
Think of what it will give us!” — Benito Mussolini,
Premier of Italy .
It is a long text for a sermon ; yet it can
hardly be shortened to advantage, for it
contains in its every part material for com-
ment by one living in the midst of this “mar-
vellous, stupendous ” American mechanical
development, and observing from day to day
the people who have created it. Mussolini’s
remarks are interesting, not only for the
questions they raise, but also as a very
shrewd estimate of the American character.
“Simplicity, refreshing childishness, almost
primitiveness in all things emotional” —one
needs not to reside very long in the U.S.A.
to become convinced of the truth of this
observation; though “adolescent” might seem
a better word than “childish” to describe the
American temperament. Here we have all
the emotional eagerness of the adolescent, the
ready response to appeals, however unreason-
able, the continual seeking after new sensa-
tions. Cults, religions, quack remedies find
here a readier acceptance than in any other
land; the American people swallow them
with an avidity that is almost pathetic, and
will respond to anything if only the appeal
be touched with sentimentality. A glance at
any American magazine will show how
cleverly the American man of business takes
advantage of this characteristic in his adver-
tising ; and so it comes about that the things
which to the Briton seem most sacred —the
love of husband and wife, for example—are
made the vehicle for urging the purchase of
soap or vacuum cleaners. As Mussolini well
remarks, the combination of ultra-modernity
and incorrigible sentimentality in the Ameri-
can temperament affords a very interesting
spectacle.
But will “the fusion of these two elements”
really produce the greatest art of all time?
The history of art would seem to show us
that art, like the wind, “bloweth where it
listeth”; when we try to formulate laws and
causes, we are met with a mass of apparent
contradictions. If, remembering England and
France, we say that only great and powerful
nations produce great art, we recall Athens
and the City States of Renaissance Italy; if
we adduce their genial climates as the reason
of their success, we are reminded of Spain
and Portugal with their artistic barrenness.
Yet, in spite of these contradictions, I think
it is safe to say that unprosperous nations
do not in general produce much great art,
though they may, of course, produce an
occasional genius, and that a country which,
like Spain or Russia, lags behind in the pro-
gress of the ages, thereby condemns itself to
sterility. The United States is eminently
large, prosperous and civilised; why, then,
is its artistic output so small and so com-
paratively poor? We may agree with Musso-
lini that American pre-occupation with com-
merce prevents the development of art. But
the history of England does not afford sup-
port for this view. England’s development
during the nineteenth century, was, if any-
thing, even more sensational than that of
the U.S.A. She was the nation of shop-
keepers, the Philistine among the nations;
yet the springs of English poetry did not
dry up, and at the height of her pre-
occupation with steamships and spinning-
jennies she produced a Browning, a Benny?
son; and at the dawn of that great com-
mercial expansion, a Shelley, a Keats, a
Byron, even a Turner, though pictorial art
has never been the medium in which English
genius most readily expressed itself. To
mention the novelists of that great period of
our history is superfluous; all the world
knows them, and the temporary cloud that
has recently enveloped them has not dimmed
their essential brightness.
Why, then, has the outburst of energy in
the United States not produced great art,
as in England during her great commercial
period? It is obviously a complicated ques-
tion, as are all questions relating to the
growth of art; but of all the subtle con-
tributing causes which go to make up this
result —the paucity of artistic genius in the
U.S.—there is one which forces itself on
the notice of the stranger dwelling within
Uncle Sam’s well-barred gates. No feature
of American life is more noticeable than
the lack of an ability to rest and think; from
the millionaire to the artisan the people are
feverish and unsettled in their methods of
living. In all the pursuits which occupy
their leisure hours they take the line of
least resistance, which involves the smallest
effort. A mania JL or moving from one place
to another afflicts all classes; they motor
for the mere sake of motoring, 'and reckon
the amount of pleasure by the distance
covered. The’same principle applies to their
mental relaxations. They take their books
pre-digested in the form of moving-pictures.
Rather than surmount the difficulties of
music, they listen to it at long range. The
result of all this is a continual state of
mental and physical stimulation, which is
totally unproductive, as it is not based upon
efliort, and which, furthermore, fosters a lack
of thoroughness that is fatal to high achieve-
ment in the world of art. Existence here
seems to resolve itself into a continued and
incessant seeking after new sensations, aban-
doning the effort to think in the feverish
desire to feel. Never was better illustrated
the truth of Shelley’s penetrating phrase
about “unrest which men miscall delight” than
in this teeming civilisation. Will this people
indeed produce, in the fulness of time, a
Shakspeare, a Beethoven, a Michelangelo?
At present they have destroyed Contempla-
tion, the parent of all Art; and they have
yet to learn the lesson taught by Plato, which
his own people learned so well : “The whole
life of man stands in need of grace and har-
mony.”
SCHENECTADY, U.S.A.
C. B. M.
The Pessimism of Conrad
Irony is the most intellectual and power-
ful form of humor. It withers presumption
and pretension. It exalts and glorifies the
heroic. It turns a godlike smile of charity
upon humility and simplicity. The greater
the intellect the more responsive it is to the
ironic in man’s relations with the universe.
Irony is the master stroke of the comic spirit
which passes by imperceptible chameleon
shades into the tragic, and back again into
the comic.
This century has seen three great ironists
—Thomas Hardy, Anatole France and Joseph
Conrad. Of these only one survives—the
octogenarian ironist of Wessex, whose nature
■ was rendered vocal by the tragic aspect of
life, whose works are full of the feeling of
the immutability of nature and the muta-
bility of human life; the inexorable char-
acter of natural laws and the puny struggles
of human personalities trying to evade them.
Anatole France is less Greek in his accept-
ance of Nemesis and more Virgilian in taste
and feeling. He is of all moderns the writer
who makes us feel that the universe is an
immense concern which should be, but is
not, conducted seriously and according to the
dictates of a divine and infallible intelligence.
There is less sting in the irony of the French-
man than in the ironic spirit of the Anglo-
Saxon ; there is a more sensitive indulgence
for the frailties of human nature. There
exists also this profound difference between
the two minds: Hardy writes with a feeling
of the terrible awe-inspiring nature of the
rationality of Fate; France with the whim-
sical spirit of one who is highly amused by
the spectacle of the complete irrationality
of things.
Joseph Conrad differs from both. He
leayes to his readers the task of drawing
their own conclusions. There is no sys-
tematic theory of life either explicit or im-
plicit in any of his books. Never is his
creative power shackled by preconceived ideas
upon the direction or meaning of existence.
Yet Conrad possesses an incomparable
power of showing man that he is but an
infinitesimal part of a formidable unity
in which his existence (so important in his
own estimation) is both fortuitous and
futile, but neither insignificant nor useless.
Vain as it may seem, man’s effort has its
own grandeur. Human intelligence reveals
that there exists something beyond the tragic
futility of life. It is indeed this intelli-
gence in an atmosphere of futility which con-
vinces us that man is the possessor within
himself of a scintilla of the divine.
On this subject Conrad nowhere makes any
affirmation. The mysterious aspect of life
and the inexorable energy of nature stimu-
late him, but the mysticism of religious ritual
and creeds leaves him incredulous. Herein
lies the reason for his particular tone of
detachment, and that attitude of ironic im-
passivity so foreign to the native genius of
the Polish race. He gives way neither to
enthusiasm, to anger nor to disgust. He is
sincere because he knows that every false-
hood contains some_ essence of the truth, and
that in every truth is hidden something which
is merely conventional opinion. From the
fact that he sees chance everywhere, and the
cast of the dice in everything, he has been
called a pessimist. He is no more a pessi-
mist than he is an optimist. Can it be said
with any greater critical justice that he is
a fatalist?
Let us not forget when we search for an
answer to the question that Conrad was
a. sailor, and that, even if he was willing to
circumscribe his soul within the traditional
limits of the English novel, he had lived for
years under the naked heavens, in the ever-
moving circle of the wide horizons of the
sea, in the midst of the terrifying exuberance
of oceans and of tropical nature. It is the
sense of all this which sometimes breaks
through the bonds of reserved expression. It
is this exuberance and proliferation of a piti-
less immensity which we feel at all times
in the writer’s mind. Without losing any-
thing of essential verity the normal in his
pages clothes itself in the lyricism of the
poet. An imaginative realist, and a roman-
tic psychologist, no walls have impeded his
vision, either in the realm of the material
or in the world of morals. He suffers neither
from squinting nor from shortness of sight.
As an artist it is a matter of supreme im-
portance for him to place his both
men and women, where they shall be the
playthings of the elements, and where thev
shall appear as the victims of a maleficent
destiny. From such occasions he can distil
their moral values and indicate their com-
position, or rather their decomposition,
through the instrumentality of the reactions
of human beings to the circumstances in
which they are placed. It is difficult to know
whethfer or not Conrad has any belief in the
efficacy of his puppets. There is in his works
the inscrutability of an ironic creator.
For the people of his creation he evinces
an heroic impartiality. He considers their
conduct with an artist’s care for line, form
and color; everything is cunningly subor-
dinated to the absorbing interest he takes in
the souls of his creatures. Sometimes, with-
out preparation or warning, he turns a cruel
searchlight beam into the most secret places
of the heart, giving a vision of things which
leaves the reader dazzled. But he never con-
descends to supply either moral justification
or condemnation. No moral lesson can be
drawn from Conrad’s works, except that life
is a peril and a constant danger. Fate lies
hidden in an augur-hole. In the universe of
Conrad there is no ethical preoccupation, no
moral providence. Sincerity, truth, loyalty
and a sense of personal dignity must alone
be man s inspiration in life. Such virtues
carry with them their own reward.
He nowhere gives expression to faith in
the popular delusion that individual courago

broken by adverse forces receives some com-
pensation, in either this world or another.
He shows no sentimental tenderness for such
courage or heroism. Regrets are supernu-
ous and sterile; compassion is a weakness.
If. however, he abstains from vain regiets,
if he voluntarily takes up an attitude of
stoic serenity, Conrad none the less shows
a restrained pity for the victims of circum-
stance. At the bottom we know. that his
heart trembles with ardent sympathies. But
he has too much humility, reserve and pride
ever to give way to a ridiculous gesture of
revolt, or to useless maledictions. He is
strong enough to face the truth. lie lias
indeed a kind of fierce love of the truth.
Hear him upon the greatest of all Ins
themes, the sea: —
He —man or people—who, putting his trust in the
friendship of the sea, neglects the strength and
cunning of his right hand, is a fool. As if it were
too great, too mighty for common virtues, the ocean
has no compassion, no faith, no law, no memory.
Its fickleness is to be held true to men's purposes only
by an undaunted resolution, and by a sleepless, armed,
jealous vigilance, in which perhaps there has always
been more hate than love. “Odi et Amo ” may well
be the confession of those who consciously or blindly
have surrendered their existence to the fascination of
the sea. All the tempestuous passions of mankind’s
young days, the love of loot and the love of glory,
with the great love of the unknown and vast dreams
of dominion and power, have passed like images
reflected from a mirror, leaving no record upon the
mysterious face of the sea. Impenetrable and heart-
less, the sea has given nothing of itself to the
suitors for its precarious favours. Unlike the earth,
it cannot be subjugated at any cost of patience and
toil.
FRANCIS JACKSON.
Various Verse
I was very thankful for the dictum of
“P.0.M.” (R.P. 6/11/’24) that “no lyric
verse can ever be capable of prose explana-
tion,” and that inability to understand it
is due to “intellectual warp,” as this proves
to me, and I should say about 98 per cent,
of poetry readers and lovers, that our in-
ability to understand modern verse is due
(as “P.0.M.” admits possible) not to in-
tellectual weakness, but to an intellectual
warp in supposing that lyric verse was cap-
able of prose (or mental) explanation. This
also shows the fallacy of our supposing that
such men as Tennyson, Longfellow. Shelley,
Gray, Byron, Pope, Cowper, Macaulay,
Keats, Hood, Burns and many others, even
including such Philistines as Shakspeare,
occasionally wrote a lyric. For the 98 per
cent, of “intellectually warped” poetry read-
ers can understand every word these men
wrote, and in most cases, even if the verses
are forgotten, can repeat the sense of them
in prose; and although by this means the
present music of them is lost, the memory of
it remains to charm and comfort us. For
a moment I was alarmed to think that the
old favorites of us “warps” must be tabooed
and placed on the “index.” In a flash of
my warped intellect I saw, standing on a
precipice overhanging Hell and about to fall
over, Gray’s “Elegy,” Richard Barham’s “As
I lay a-thynkynge,” and a great host of
others that I know well; but I was soon re-
assured. A huge, muscular arm swept round
them all and drew them back to a place of
perfect safety, which was called “classic”;
and the precipice is now available for the
modern “lyric.”
I am too old-fashioned to admit that all
the writers previous to the last 50 years
were not poets at all, but am willing to com-
promise and call them, not lyrical, but
classical. Most of these latter were not only
so transparent that their thoughts were re-
vealed at a glance, but their very characters
were exhibited in their work. We can know
Byron, Scott. Burns, Hood, Longfellow, Cow-
per—even Shakspeare and Milton —better
than had we lived two years in the same
house with them. Their biographies seem
to me a vulgar superfluity. But disputes
have risen as to whether up-to-date bio-
graphies of modern, true, thought-concealing
poets would increase their popularity. I
say yes. As their writings express nothing
(except to 2 per cent, of their readers), we
cannot possibly judge the authors without
biographies.
I have spoken in a general sense of
“modern verse” as if it all came up to
“P.O.M.’s” definition of “lyric.” But there
are still writers of comprehensible verses who
are therefore not included. Let them be
comforted. The 2 per cent, of super-intel-
lects can only stand their lyrics on the be-
fore-mentioned untenable precipice. But if
the comprehensible writers can please us 98
per cent, of warped intellects, we can and will
place them on a safe platform where we keep
our other classics. The super-intellects may
pity our taste, but they cannot improve it.
C. W.
The person who wants verse explained may
be assured that it is unexplainable to him.
He doesn’t read it habitually. Why should
he when it gives him so little pleasure?
Doubtless there are readers who would like
The Bulletin’s jokes explained to them.
But one might as well dissect some beautiful
bird on the wing and expect to preserve its
beauty as explain a joke and preserve that
spontaneity, whimsical or ironic, that is its
essence. It is even so as to verse.
But, fortunately, most Australians to
whom The Bulletin sells itself—also those
more who borrow or inherit it —have a sense
of humor, and likewise a sense of beauty;
and a sub-section of the latter quality might
well be called a loving understanding of
verse or poetry. And, as it is generally
recognised that a saving sense of humor will
ameliorate the most irritating conditions of
life, and enable its happy possessor to get
more enjoyment from life than he otherwise
could, so kTn uplifting sense of beauty will
sustain and help over life’s drab patches
and increase the enjoyment of that which
is really enjoyable.
I suppose it is possible to cultivate to some
extent a sense of humor or of beauty; but I
cannot think any increase of parasitical litera-
ture about literature, of writing about writ-
ers, could induce such desirable activity.
And here my mind steps back a space to
see a procession of Bulletins propped over
a hand-separator. Tattered and milk-spat-
tered, how they lightened that twice-daily
grind for Bill or Tom or Ciss—though it
was the churn more often accompanied Ciss’s
devotions! Of course, the rest of the paper
was read ; but “Various Verse” was always
most tattered and most milk-spattered. And
verse read, and re-read and memorised, and
cogitated over as that was becomes part of
us as surely as the material food we eat. I
know that in long, dawn-commencing hours of
milking, when the monotony of occupation
left the mind so empty that it ached, remem-
bered verse, tender, gay, revealing, tragic,
brought soothing distraction.
To round off this par. nicely I should be
able to say that Bill or Tom or Ciss grew
up to be Henry Lawson or Mary Gilmore or
an Australian Prime Minister. They did
not. But they have gone far from that
primitive cow-farm, unlovely and unloved,
since then ; and verse helped them along the
track. Man, by taking thought, can add a
cubit or so to his mental stature ; and to very
many verse represents the most appetising
and vttamine-rich form in which to take
thought.
Explanations? Well, there’s the alphabet
and grammar at school, and then perhaps
there’s the dictionary. Beyond that —well,
just keep on publishing “Various Verse.”
And in the column set aside for explanation
—why, publish some more verse!
L’Fou.
Lawrence’s Australia and Jack Grant
It really is exasperating! Critics who
ought to know better will confuse morals
with merits and not stay for an answer.
All the straightening-out of what is Art
and Artistry necessarily leaves them con-
vinced, yet of the same opinion still.
Astounded by the callow critiques of “Kan-
garoo” and the failure of “great dailies” to
see the forest of Genius for the trees of Good
and Evil, I whimsically collected notices
of The Boy in the Bush (D. 11. Law-
rence and M. L. Skinner). With one accord
they yelp “unclean!” In Melbourne the
Argus complains of its “rather nauseating”
“stark realism” ; the Herald sneers at the
“psychological complex” it supposes the hero
to represent; the Sun weeps that if the work
is “a success it will be a success of scandal” ;
and the Age screams that “the novel repre-
sents a nightmarish country inhabited by
incredible people. It is an Australia seen
through the eyes of a degenerate.”
Clearly “The Boy in the Bush” is not for
these oafs at the typewriters. The book is
simply not “a success of scandal” —that sort
of success goes elsewhere, and why is obvi-
ous enough. With as little justification
nearly all the masterpieces, from the Bible
onward, had been outlawed. On a question of
fact the Age summary is sheer malignant mal-
practice. Critics of the sort are scotched by
Lawrence himself in anticipation of their
reprisals. “You* beware of this country, my
boy, and don’t try to play larks with it,”
says one of his characters. It is what the
smug papers shout at Lawrence. Sacred
damn country!—to be interpreted only by
rote of daily newspaperdom! “The Boy
in the Bush” is for Bulletin readers, or
that inner circle which believes literature to
be something of style and spunk, and, if
great, great whether romantic or realistic, ugly
or lovely, stark or saccharine; should it stir,
shake, soothe, be liked or detested, literary
if but the salt and savor of calibre be there.
It is quite immaterial to this estimate that
The Bulletin’s fine freedom gives voice to
odd orthodoxies, such as “T.B.C.’s” (R.P.
13/11/’24) , as much as to heresies like mine.
Had this book been a first book it con-
ceivably had made a sensation ; but we have
got used to Lawrence, and most of us, I
think, have found him one too many for us.
He perhaps palls quantitatively, paying the
penalty of familiarity. But great and rare
he is qualitatively, and too huge for the
moralists to maim. He is indubitably the
most Russian of our novelists —our one ap-
proximation to Dostoievsky, equally laying
bare witli repellent exactitude the’ Hidden
Innermost, whence spring the cloaks of con-
duct, that veneer we hug lest we know our-
selves too well and make an end of the pos-
turing shreds and patches deadly respecta-
bility makes of us. There is a cult which
thinks it finishes with the gift for disrobing
Human Nature by putting its fingers to it*
nose as it runs for cover. “It smells!”
this cult. cries, not understanding that a
stink, if it is a grand stink, is Letters equ-
ally witli the primrose by the river’s brim.
Here, however, Lawrence confounds the
muck-raking canons, for of pioneer life and
indigenous features the novel is wondrously
true and beautiful with a wealth of pene-
trative portrayal. Of that superb Bush
which, even when swept away before the
march of man, will everlastingly make our
lore and legend, and to which, willy-nilly,
our continent—unlike Europe—is tied by
stored-up associations in undying sohg and
story, the passages are purple beyond com-
pare. Australia of Back-of-Beyond is richly
yours for the feasting. Though you’ve read
of the lust of gold, yet never have you read
of it quite from the Lawrence point of view.
Literary nuggets, wonderful nuggets, richly
prodigal, are to be found fitting like a glove
our land of here and now as much as of
40 years ago: pioneering is not yet past.
No detail is forgotten ; even crystallisations
of the stupefying heat you have felt if you
have travelled your outposts.
Jack Grant, the boy, is far from being the
broth of a boy. He’s all streaks. He’s
everything in turns and nothing—but him-
self—long. He has a fight (thrilling rounds
for the rough diamond), he kills a man
(grimly Nietzscliean in the callous non-senti-
mentality of its telling) ; he sleeps with a
girl; he tries to seduce another; he marries
a third magnificently, and is wearied by her
babies; he mocks and scoffs at “leading
lights”; and is a very devil in his sardonic
humors.... all of this, but not — not —a de-
generate : in a thousand ways rather a born
backblocks Australian with urban intellect.
The talents of Lawrence are shown in the
strength with which he takes a “pommy”
and makes him into a dinkum Australian.
Consider this as sample of how you, too,
may have felt:—
Gradually they got farther and farther, geographi-
cally, mentally and emotionally, from Wandoo....
Jack was glad. He loved the earth, the wild coun-
try, the bush, the scent. He wanted to go on for
ever. Beyond the settlements —beyond the ploughed
land —beyond all fences. That was it —beyond all
fences. Beyond all fences, where a man was alone
with himself and the untouched earth. .. .The land
untouched by man. The call of the mysterious, vast
unoccupied land. The strange inaudible calling, like
the far-off call of a kangaroo. The strange, ’ still,
pure air. The strange shadows. The strange scent
of wild, brown aboriginal honey.
It would not be Lawrence if there were
not the touch of the mystical-enigmatic in
the opulent reveries that you get side by
side with alert materialism of the shrillest.
Note the jump from one to the other: —
You have moved outside the pale, the pale of
civilisation, the pale of the general human conscious-
ness. . . .You can move into regions outside of it. As
in Australia. The broadcasting of the vast human
consciousness can’t get you. You are beyond. . . .
There is no past.... Why saddle yourself with such
a spectre as the future? There is the moment. You
sweat, you rest, the bugs bite you, you thirst, you
drink, you think you’re going to die, you don’t care,
and you know you won’t die, because a certain stub-
bornness inside you keeps the upper hand. So you
go on.
Because alongside descriptive skill at its
zenith we have Sex hatefully alluring, with
no happy endings, Lawrence’s masterpiece
of this masterful land is to be tabu! But
it is this very conception of masterfulness
that peculiarly distinguishes Lawrence’s two
books on our country. To him it is tremen-
dously a land of mastery. .. .and we may add
of magic and mystery—a Holy, Holy, Holy,
Lord God Almighty among islands, blest
and excelling.
I would that an Australian had written
“Kangaroo” and “The Boy in the Bush.”
Alas! an Australian never will write them
until the critics are chosen away from the
conventional haunts, tethered to the apron
strings of pleasant little mummeries and
moralities set on high as the immaculate
standards of literary judgment. The atti-
tude to Lawrence should be pride that he
cliooseth Australia for analysis and apo-
theosis. However you take “The Boy in the
Bush” morally, you dare not deny its psycho-
analytic power of detachment as shown in
the equal treatment of femininity and mas-
culinity. This equality, if the critics would
but see it, is Lawrence’s tribute to woman-
hood. Brutal as the book is in its bold
slobberless narrative of such happenings as
out-back deaths and feuds, yet never a snarl
without a sting that pierces for one’s good.
The pages are splendid as much as terrible,
especially in the series of lonely dialogues
between one and one’s self on the strange,
never-to-be-solved issues of life and death.
Lawrence demonstrates characterisation of
soil as well as soul to be more than sight-
seeing and telling of it; he puts correctly
into a typical Australian mind what that
inarticulate mind has no lips to spell out.

A Satchel of Books
Boxer and Beauty, by Alfred Ollivant (Ileinemann).
Ollivant is the author of that capital dog-story,
“Ould Bob.” Ilis new friends, Boxer and Beauty,
are two carthorses born and trained on Gallop's
farm. A simple country tale full of that affection
for the dumb servants of our will which makes its
appeal to all who love a horse or a dog—cats seem
to be outside the orbit.
A Nineteenth-century Childhood, by Mary Mae-
Carthy (Heinemann). In her day politicians were
“noble gentlemen unpaid.” In decorative art “William
Morris’s chintzes and wallpapers had been accepted,
and his Socialism left quietly at Hammersmith”; in
poetry “Lord Tennyson was living a deliciously
sheltered life at Farringford, perplexed about immor-
tality.” So the family life went on. It was the
nineteenth century. All was safe. Such a calamity
as the Great War was unthinkable. Queen Victoria
had them in her keeping. A wistful, half-sad look-
back for the dying generation, a curious but interest-
ing exposition for the new.
Travellers’ Joy: A device, invented by Dion Clay-
ton Calthrop and depicted by Gilbert Pownall (Heirie-
mann). All children like atlases when there is an
adult available to interpret the romance of them.
Here is an atlas with all the romance plain to be
seen. And none of your prosaic countries which you
can buy steamer tickets to, either. Pirate Island,
the Market-place, Redindiana, the Railway Map,
Fairyland and Explorer’s Country arc the places the
young tourist is invited to ; and he will have plenty
of thrilling adventures on the way.
A College Mystery, by A. P. Baker (Heffer and
Sons). Cambridge men, especially those of Christ’s
College, will be interested in this story of the
apparition in the Fellows’ Garden. Occupants of
the Fellows’ building have from time to time
stated that on certain occasions they have observed
the figure of a man emerge on the lawn from a
group of chestnuts and walk up and down the garden.
The story runs that one Christopher Round, a Fellow,
out of jealousy murdered in the garden pond a
brother Fellow, his rival in love and letters. Over-
come by remorse, Round became a recluse. Among
the papers left at his death was one containing a
full confession. The story is well told.
Messalina, by Vivian Crockett (Jonathan Cape).
It is an adventure in the field of literature fer an
Australian author to take a classical subject for his
pen. The American “Ben Hur” made wide appeal
from a religious point of view'. Mr. Crockett, for
his part, trusts wholly to the dramatic interest of
his story. The scholar may find matters to cavil
at, hut as a background his picture of the times is
sufficient for its purpose. Further, it has the essen-
tial quality of action; and if here and there a
modern form of address such as “Madam” strikes the
ear as incongruous, it does not break the interest.
Messalina is revealed, as a child, evading home re-
straints and seeking voluptuous pleasures in the groves
of Daphne, that Elysium of Antioch, the temporary
heme of Messala and his wife Lepidus, fit mother of
a wanton daughter. From Daphne the author at a
stroke carries us into the life of the Court. Here
is chronicled Messalina’s infatuation for Mnester;
then come, Myronides, soldier and tribune, and Cains
Silius, who fed her with a fatal ambition. The
final chapters deal with the fall of Messalina from
her crazy pedestal of lust and cruelty, avarice and
tyranny. The story is told in terms of drama, not
melodrama; the style is simple but forceful.
“M.G.S.”: In “Dead Sea Fruit” (R.P. 23/10/’24)
“Origma” wastes in abuse of me enthusiasm that
might be expended in a worthier cause. In asking
for more instruction for the rising generation in
the beauty and uses of our native flora, I was not
contemplating the creation of a nation of Hudsons
or Gilbert Whites, such exquisitely tuned nature-
lovers being born, not made; I was merely hoping
for a next generation sufficiently educated in the
esthetic and economic value of trees and other
defenceless natural features not to wish to exterminate
them at sight. The possibility of instilling a rudi-
mentary communal sense into the human animal
has been demonstrated. The driver of a vehicle
keeps to the left; the habit of discipline becomes
ingrained, until it no longer requires the reminder
of a policeman’s presence. In the same way it
would be quite possible to inculcate into Australians,
some sort of forest conscience, so that the chopping
down of a beautiful gum-tree, even on one’s own
land, would cause a guilty reaction. The newspapers
are being bombarded by letter writers complaining
of the wholesale destruction of the native flora ; but
the protests are quite futile. These savages destroy
because they do not understand, and they do not
understand because they' have not been taught.

A satisfactory road which will carry modern heavy
traffic must maintain a good surface, resist wear and tear
of traffic, and distribute traffic loads over the sub-grade.
A concrete road reinforced with B.R.C. Fabric effectively
fulfils these conditions because
(1) B.R.C. Fabric prevents surface cracks spreading.
(2) „ „ enables the road to resist traffic
shocks without fracture.
(3) „ ~ enables the road to spread its load
from the point of application over a
large area of sub-grade.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Spring.
What is Spring doing in my blood?
It dances like a naughty child
That finds the freedom of a wood
And. like a petal of the wild,
Upon the gloom a golden mote,
Flits here and there as blown leaves float
What is Spring doing in my blood?
My thoughts leap forth to meet it there,
As in some house of serious mood
There comes a light foot on the stair,
A quick unwary laugh that spells
The jester with his cap and bells.
What is Spring doing in my blood?
It cups its hand and blows a kiss,
Drapes o’er grey gowns a scarlet snood,
And, foolish as a love-sick miss,
it turns old memories about
And rummages lost perfumes out.
What is Spring doing in my blood?
It cries of blossoms and of you ;
It bids me to a far-off wood
Where trees run down to meet the blue.
Each sandal bears a beating wing
Of that strange folly that is Spring!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Lord of All.
Change is the lord of all, they say,
Working his will on mortal things—
Spring and summer, and night and day,
Tinkers, tailors and queens and kings,
Youth and beauty, and work and play,
All that sorrows and all that sings.
Little or big it matters not,
Each must travel the selfsame road
Smooth and shady, and rough and hot,
Take his pleasure and hump his load,
Rise and ripen, and fall and rot- —
Change his ruler, with changeless code.
Passion lasts but a little while,
Joy takes wings and is gone, forsooth!
Beauty fades with a pensive smile,
Love likes only to live with Youth;
Officer, soldier, rank and file —
Change takes toll of us all, in truth!
Change is the lord of all, they say;
Yet. though mighty his magic powers,
Memory ever eludes liis sway,
Caring nought for his greying hours;
Love may nerish and youth decay,
Memory sees them as deathless flowers.

The Pageant.
Something my window has shaken;
And a voice through my slumber is drum-
ming
Cheerily—“ Waken, oh waken,
For the dawn in its glory is coming!”
And, waking, I hear the glad rushing
Of the breezes that herald the morning
Over niglit-shadowed lands.
Past the trees and the house-gables brushing.
And the earth leaps awake at the warning
With a clapping of hands.
(Jre'y light my chamber is filling;
There’s a stir in the soft air conveying
Sounds to my ears that are thrilling.
For the bands of the dawn all are play-
ing—
Their music grows stronger and larger.
Till I hear the drum liltingly beating.
And such sounds fill the earth
As the proud-pricking prance of the charger,
And the rush of a multitude fleeting
In a chorus of mirth.
Bright spears through the grey are gleaming,
The night flies in gloomy abasement;
1 throw off the cloak of my dreaming
To leap at a bound to my casement.
T catch but the glow of the fire
The hoofs of Dawn’s horses swift speeding
On the glad roofs have cast.
The day is here, ripe for desire:
And the earth in its beauty is pleading. ...
But the pageant has passed.
VICTORIA.
HAMER.
The Old Cities.
The old cities of learning under a clouded
sky
Lift up tlieir quiet turrets into the quiet
air;
Dreams born of their dreaming through the
poplars sigh,
And grave ghosts walk there.
Heigho! it's a dull thought that books are
triple-piled
Like stone walls of a prison about the
minds of men ;
And ever a new doctrine is ticketed up and
filed
To be forgotten again.
But a man seeking peace from quarrelling
hopes and fears
May leave his life by the wayside to be
whitened and stripped;
He may pore all day long in the museum of
years
Over a manuscript.
There behind closed doors, happily entombed,
He may leave the world’s struggle and lose
the sky’s breath,
Finding peace in a garden among towers
sh adow-gloomed—
A grey peace of death.
Oh, lost tongues, dead speeches, the envy of
ignorance!
I have found mirth in the morning and
kissed her in a ditch:
There’s little time for learning if the sun is
a gay dance
And folly a merry witch.

THE MEDEEVAL POPES OF LABOR.
A time comes to every institution, whether
social, industrial, political or religious, when
it is due for overhaul by a Royal Commission
or a Council of Trent or some other body
of competent jurisdiction. The object is to
find out whether it has fallen into decay and
disease and calls for repair, or whether it has
outlived its usefulness and calls for removal,
or whether it ever had any usefulness. But
for its heroic and historic cleaning up, even
the Roman Catholic Church might have
passed away. The accusations made against
it were that it had ceased to lead civilisation
and become a log dragging behind; that it
had given up having responsibilities and only
retained privileges, and that it existed for its
own profit, or the profit of its leaders, and
for very little else. In its narrower sphere
Australian trades unionism presents features
of a similar character —remarkably similar
considering its recent growth and the small-
ness of the population which supplies its field
of operation. To be inside the movement is
the same as being inside the Church during
the Middle Ages, when the Church was at its
worst —a self-evident proof of merit. To be
outside the movement is the same as being
outside the Church in similar days—a self-
evident case of utter demerit and complete
cussedness, amounting even to damnation.
The insider isn’t expected to show any special
good quality apart from the fact that he is
inside, or to do any special good ser-
vice. Preference to unionists is demanded,
and very successfully enforced, but the unions
don’t require from their members any par-
ticular standard of excellence to merit the
preference. If the preferred bricklayer is a
poor hand at his trade the fact that he is
free from the taint of heresy is all the com-
pensation the person who pays his wages can
hope for.
* * * *
Political unionism in Australia grows less
and less Australian as it grows older. It
demands that this country shall never fight
in its own defence save on its own soil, a ad
amid the ruins of its own house. Any foreign
raider is to have the entire coast on which
to choose his place of attack, flitting from
point to point as suits his convenience. He
is to have the whole calendar to choose from
in selecting his time of attack. He must
never be forestalled and never pursued,
Scipio’s business-like idea of “carrying the
war into Africa” being strictly banned. The
Commonwealth is to disencumber itself of
possible allies by assuring them, quite need-
lessly, that even if they give assistance none
will ever be given in return. Then having
cast the country on its own resources it is
proposed to have a complete disarmament,
and give up possessing resources. With the
standing army—the force which is to with-
stand the shock of invasion while raw troops
of a sort are being scrambled together—re-
duced to 1703 men, no one can deny that the
disarming process is getting along bravely.
In its service to the cause of White Aus-
tralia, organised Labor has become a nega-
tive quality. Its craving to prevent white
men cominv here has grown to the dimensions
of a disease, and it incurs some expense in
postages and cablegrams in order to scare
them off. The alleged lack of employment is
assigned as a reason, but every effort is
made, by spreading the gospel of “class-
consciousness” and hatred of the “bour-
geoisie,” to put a brake on the wheel of any
effort at supplying emplovment. The North-
ern Territory is the section of the Common-
wealth where the new brand of political
Labor secured the most definite hold, and the
Territory has lost nonulation, especially
white population ; it has lost trade and trades
unionists in so remarkable a fashion that
latest returns alleged that only 72 of the
latter survived in all the vast area. Eight
years ago, before the meatworks began their
brief career, the membership amounted to
1361, which was at least respectable. Up
Darwin way the Labor movement had a free
hand and also a free mouth, and has eaten
all of itself except the tail.
* * * •
The leadership of the Australian Labor
movement has drifted too much into the
hands of imported cranks and conspirators
who don’t labor, and one of whom, at least,
frankly disavowed the White Australia doc-
trine. He didn’t lose his job or the esteem
of his followers by that, he being a crank
and imported. Among other phenomena
there is a strange tendency to slight and
disparage our allies in the late war, and
to grovel in admiration of our enemies. The
most vociferous leaders regard the men who
fought for Australia in Europe with a solid
hatred, and if a time comes when it will be
necessary to fight for Australia in Australia
itself the men who take up arms will pro-
bably be regarded in the same light. Cer-
tainly any proposal to qualify for taking up
arms in Australia’s defence is viewed in
Labor circles as anathema and the abomina-
tion of “militarism,” though the building
locally of a cruiser or two is an acceptable
idea when considered solely as a relief job.
Though the subscription inaugurated here
for beggared Russia was a frost and words
didn’t materialise in deeds, a boundless admi-
ration for the clumsy and unsuccessful bru-
tality of Moscow is considered almost essen-
tial to the up-to-date Laborite’s salvation.
There is an amateurish dabbling in treason,
and the. more “advanced” talkers of the
party announce openly that they are organis-
ing and preparing to let the accumulated
criminality and lunacy of the country loose
on what they hope will be an unarmed and
untrained community. This is to be done
for the greater glory of Karl Marx and
other foreign nuisances. Nobody does any-
thing serious to these criminals, or even
speaks seriously to them. Labor, or that
which represents it, is much less concerned
these days to keep nigger goods out of Aus-
tralia than it is to prevent, by all manner of
harassing tactics, the making of white goods
in Australia. It carries its hostility to
native industry so far, and is so tolerant to
the produets of foreign industry and the
importers thereof, that it is at times mis-
taken for the importer’s agent. In a cosmo-
politan sort of way it extends sympathy to
any and every foreign nigger, provided he
has made a row and killed white men, and
it has a friendly feeling for the local crimi-
nal, and a desire to acquit him at sight, pro-
vided he is a violent and riotous criminal,
or an arsonist who has read up the Com-
munist jargon. The Labor ideal is a police
force affiliated with the Trades Hall, and
either no army at all or a mere sketch of one,
which shall on no account “interfere in indus-
trial disputes.” And the leaders of the
erratic movement claim to be in some respects
above the moral code inasmuch as their
agreements are avowedlv made to be broken,
and wholly above the law. The other day
an imported member of the fraternity ex-
plained to a judge of the Australian High
Court that he and his union wouldn’t take
the slightest notice of his Honor’s decision,
and his Honor took it like an angel.
* * # *
Even if a Commission of Inquiry led to no
improvement it would satisfy a wide and
natural craving for information—at least,
it would do so if clothed with abundant
powers to compel the attendance of witnesses
and to insist on replies to its interrogations.
The representatives of the militant new
unionism might be asked, for instance, to
state what advantage, if any, their institu-
tion gives to its employer or to the com-
munity in return for the preference it re-
ceives ; whether it considers that it owes a
duty to itself and the community or only to
itself: exactly how far and why it considers
itself above the law in the matter of flouting
Arbitration Court awards, rioting with im-
punity, holding up industry, mutiny, job
control or any other matter which may turn
up; whether the witness, if he chance to be
of the revolutionary brand, has a definite
and sufficient plan for preventing the slaugh-
ter of the helpless and the innocent when
his shindy starts, or if he holds that killing
is no murder provided he or his friends do
it; and whether it is a sufficient virtue (a
title to a mansion in the sky, so to speak)
to be Labor; just as it might be a virtue to
be Lumber or Lobscouse, or if any moral
qualities are expected to go with the dignity.
A Commission of Inquiry aided by brilliant
cross-examiners might produce a report which
would teem with information.
THE TYRANT OF EGYPT.
When Lloyd George made his celebrated
gesture of handing the Gyppo his independ-
ence, the little Welshman doubtless believed
that he was doing something real and perma-
nent : and as imperialism was in an apologetic
frame of mind at the moment he won a
lot of applause from people who are vocif-
erating “We told you so” to-day. As a
matter of fact, he was not saving the illi-
terate person in the nightshirt from a tyrant's
sway, for the reason that the Gyppo keeps
his tyrant on the premises. The despot that
the _ Gyppo groans under is more ruthless,
ancient and unshakeable than the worst im-
perialism yet devised. All the Pharaohs and
the foreign invaders who thought they were
imposing their rule on Egypt were merely
the policemen of the local tyrant. Shi-
shank of Bubastis, Xerxes, Artaxerxes,
Ptolemy and the rest came and went with-
out shaking his control. From the Abbasite
Caliphs and the Mamelukes to Napoleon
and the French and British financial domi-
nation, Egypt’s history has been the record
of everlasting struggles by alien imperial-
isms to oust one another ; but the home-grown
autocrat remained impregnable. The tyrant
whom the Egyptians have groaned under
from the first syllable of recorded time is
the Nile. That long-drawn-out waterway
has its mysterious origin in the dim centre
of darkest Africa (to the • Egyptians the
strange thing flowed from the finger of God),
and has poured its yellow flood across the
desert sands of Egypt for untold centuries.
Sometimes the stream is thin and feeble,
sometimes turbulent and broad. After it
has risen and fallen again it leaves a frail
deposit of black mud behind it, amounting
in a century to a bare six inches ; and this
sediment contributes to make the soil of
Egypt the richest in the world. Every tra-
veller in Egypt since the days of the Greeks
has commented on the phenomenon of this
rise and fall and its consequences in the
habits of the people. So rhythmical are
its annual pulsations that they can be fore-
told almost to a day. Early in April is the
schedule time at Khartoum, and June 25 is
the fixed date in Lower Egypt. The in-
undation reaches its height in three months,
remains stationary for 12 days and then
gradually subsides, leaving behind its pre-
cious film of soil.

Just how much of the self-reliance and
independence characteristic of the Austra-
lian soldier on Gallipoli and in France was
due to innate qualities and how much to
red rust, rabbits, droughts, prickly-pear and
other factors that make living precarious on
this isolated continent is hard to say; but
there is no doubt hard living makes a hard
race, and that easy and secure subsistence
makes a soft one. The lot of the Egyptian
peasant is endless toil, but it is a task of
dull routine and one that never varies from
year to year. The cloudless sky hangs over
him, and the empty desert is at his back,
and for thousands of years he has clung, like
an ant on a floating straw, to the river which
gives him his existence as a gift that is
never withheld but never varied. The empty
routine of his daily life is reflected in his
institutions. It is the fashion to enthuse
over the wonderful achievements of Egyp-
tian civilisation, but the monuments it left
are those of mental children. The Pyramids
are quoted as examples of Egyptian art.
Nothing more infantile could be imagined
than the piling, at the cost of an infinity
of toil, of one. stone upon another merely to
achieve a point. Western savants find a
wealth of mysterious meaning in the
Sphinx’s gaze; a comparison with the rest
of ancient Egypt’s portrait statues betrays
that the unenigmatic expressionlessness of
that effigy with the broken nose hides a men-
tal vacuum. Copying the same conventional
designs in their mural decorations year after
year and century after century, the Egyp-
tians attained to an astounding manual dex-
terity : yet the conceptions they reiterated
were the typical viewpoint of the child. The
face is drawn in profile and the eyes full
face; the bust is turned in one direction
and the legs in another—it is anybody’s
infant’s first idea of the human form. But
it is in their temple architecture that the
Nilotes showed their inability to grow up.
The distinguishing characteristic of their
temples is the column which the Greeks
adopted afterwards and lifted into the per-
fect beauty and utility of Doric. The Egvp-
tian column does not express the function
of a column at all. It is a vegetable growth,
a monstrous tuber that can be whittled down
by a third of its bloated dimensions without
affecting its strength in any way. The Egyp-
tians, like a modern child with a meccano
set, shuffled and re-shuffled this childish
motive for two thousand years.
* * * •
Doubtless the first* person the ancient
Egyptians fell down and worshipped was the
observant fellah —Gyppo for “bloke”—who
was clever enough to see that the Nile rose
and fell so regularly that its annual inun-
dations could be prognosticated almost to
the minute. His preparations for that mys-
terious event would invest him with a repu-
tation for omniscience. No Egyptian ever
having had the enterprise to penetrate to
the sources of the river, its disciplined be-
havior appeared a thing of magic, and the
prophet who foretold it was obviously the
magician who controlled it. He became the
first policeman of the river’s slaves. All the
imperialisms that have followed have merely
taken their turn of duty at a thankless job.
THE CRYING NEED FOR A WAR.
From a man who wants it:—
The writer of that article about the desolation
wrought by the dingo West of Darling (B. 4/12/’24)
has opened up an important subject. Few realise
what a barrier to the settlement of out-back Australia
the wild dog has become, what an obstacle to the
expansion of our greatest industry. He has ravaged
Western Queensland as well as Western N. S.
Wales, with the result, among others, that
stations which used to pasture the profit-yielding and
empldyment-giving sheep are now abandoned to cattle,
which den t pay under present conditions, or aban-
doned altogether. The sneaking marauder is a
curse to the Northern Territory and the neighboring
districts of South Australia, and the Nullarbor Plain
is one of his favorite haunts. That region, which is
larger than Victoria, is popularly supposed to be a
hopeless wilderness, but the fact is that it carries
a good growth of saltbush and bluebush, together
with fair grass in the wet season, has a better rainfall
than some thriving pastoral areas as well as vast
artesian supplies, and if the dingo were eradicated
would support millions of sheep. The last state-
ment is true of other vast unsettled parts of
Westralia, and of settled parts, too. There are
comparatively few' sheep in the wheat belt, extensive
as it is. It is impossible to keep them without
dingo-proof fencing, and that the majority of the
cockies cannot afford. Yet for want of sheep their
land grows foul with mustard and other weeds; there
is waste of grain as well as grass. The wild dog
is a far worse plague in Groperland than the rabbit.
Whether because of the two fences built 20 years
ago, or the long dry summers, reinforced in places
by the poison-cart, Bunny’s advance has been halted
at the eastern fringe of settlement; but the dingo
and his confederate, the domestic dog that has gone
bush, are prevalent even in districts that have been
settled for the best part of a century. The hostile
measures of the State Government and the few local
Vermin Boards have pitiably failed.
* * * *
The fact is that the wild-dog question has grown
too big for State Governments to handle. It has
become a national problem, and will have to be
tackled nationally, otherwise things will go from
bad to worse. What the situation calls for is a
continent-wide campaign for the extermination of
the dingo—a campaign so planned that a Vermin
Board would cover every infected area and there
w'ould be a mobilisation of trappers and all the bush
labor required. In the working out of the plan,
which would obviously involve the construction of
dog-proof (and, where necessary, rabbit-proof) fences
on a vast scale —the materials would, of course, be
obtained from Australian factories, which, incidentally,
are having none too bright a time—suitable country
in Western N. S. Wales, Western Queensland, the
N.T., the northern areas of South Aus., the Nullarbor,
Central and North-West Groperland might be cut up
into small runs and equipped in a modest way for
picked settlers, preference being given to applicants
from the trapping and fencing and water-supply
parties. There would ;be no politics in such a busi-
ness, and the A.W.lj. would doubtless co-operate.
Under the guidance of dull dogs like Bailey and
Lambeht the great bush union has done some stupid
things of recent years, but it is still imbued with
the good Australian spirit of Donald Macdonell,
and it could be depended upon to further a move-
ment calculated to provide employment for so many
of its members at the outset and multiply it for
the future ; and, above all, to help Australia. With
the departure of the dingo there would be a spread
of pastoral settlement to vast tracts now vacant
of people, and therefore in danger; and there would
be a corresponding increase in the production of
the commodity which has saved Australia from
economic disaster since 1914 (even though we
foolishly export most of it in the raw state instead
of sending the entire output to our own factories
and mills) and the w'orld-demand for which is
bound to increase. There would be avoidance of
waste and prevention of needless suffering as well.

We Australians have behaved badly to our good
friend the sheep. We overstock in bountiful seasons,
and when drought comes he perishes in myriads. We
introduced the rabbit, now his ravenous foe in the
struggle for existence. We allow the maggot-fly to
torture him; the dingo to tear his young to pieces.
Too often we carry him to market in overcrowded
and unwatered trucks, with the result that many poor
beasts are hauled out dead. But we have paid
dearly, as we deserve to do, for all this ingratitude
and inhumanity; in 1891 we owned 106,400,000
sheep ; in 1922—the latest year for which figures
are given by the Commonwealth statistician —there
were only 78,800,000. By comparison, the number
of sheep in the Union of S’Africa has increased
from 20,000,000 to 32,000,000 in 15 years; and
the quality of S’African wool—thanks to our careless
habit of sending pedigreed stock to a country which
refuses to sell us ostriches in return —has been im-
proving all the time. The sheep can pick up a
living in almost every part of Australia, and our
flocks would be doubled or trebled in a generation
if we waged effective war on his enemies. And the
thing could be done if we dropped our senseless
class and party strife and worked together for the
good of Australia: with fences and vigilance we
could get rid of the wild dog and the rabbit;
with borax and energy we could do away with the
maggot-fly, and the house-fly (bearer of disease and
misery) for that matter. Of course, a national
plan of dingo extermination would have to be
financed, in the first place, by the Commonwealth
Government. But part of the outlay would be
repaid by those who received dog-proof wire cn
loan; another part would come back in rates and
taxes; and a third part would accrue from trans-
actions in Crown land, for which there would obvi-
ously be a multiplied demand at increased rates.
And in the process of the seasons the whole expendi-
ture would be returned many times over by the
fecund and faithful sheep.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Firestick and the Constitution.
“Owing to the seamen’s strike the port of Fre-
mantle is almost closed. Inter-State services have
been suspended. The Federal Government will take
action to restore normal functions.”
On that day the rowdy element was in pos-
session of the waterfront at Fremantle, and
might take charge of the place itself at any
hour; and there was no sign of the State
Labor Government doing anything energetic,
being afraid, no doubt, of losing votes. In
such circumstances nervous people begin to
read up the Federal Constitution to see
what provision has been made against too
much crisis. In the effort to make a pains-
taking copy of the old document at Washing-
ton the Constitution-makers provided :
The Commonwealth shall protect every State against
invasion and, on the application of the Executive
Government of the State, against domestic violence.
This is taken to mean that domestic violence
may rage all over the Commonwealth un-
checked until an invitation arrives from the
local Ministry. Up to that point the
power which controls the army and navy,
and which will be served with the bill for
damage done to foreign subjects, is supposed
to remain torpid. Yet there are at least
three reasons why a State Executive might


decide to maintain an attitude of patient re-
serve, and let tilings burn.- One is that it
may be of the Bolshevik type itself, and that
the rioters and looters may be its own poli-
tical supporters. A second is that it may
be under duress, or even under lock and key.
A third is that, though nominally still a free
agent, it may have no mind to expose itselt
to the animosity of the mob by calling for
assistance to a Government which has so
little to give. The latest “Official Year Book
(page 589) alleges that Australia’s stalwart
first line of defence —the military men “per-
manently employed”—on the last day of last
year numbered 1703. There are citizen sol-
diers (whom their unions would possibly for-
bid to stir), a reserve of officers (13,628 of
them) left over from the war and steadily
ageing, 285 chaplains and so forth, but the
force available on any given instant is (or
was) 1703. This is the record of two years:
Dec.,’2l. Dec,,’23.
Permanently employed .. .. 3,179 1,703
Citizen soldiers . . . . . . 124,489 36,900
Unattached list of officers . . 292 483
Engineer and railway staff corps 47 47
Area medical officers . . . . 144 -
Rifle clubs . . .. .. 47,638 •
Reserve of officers .. .. 10,660 13,628
Chaplains.. .. .. .. 408 285
186,857 53,046
The dropping out of tw r o categories and the
loss of 123 chaplains are minor items. The
matter of real importance is that when the
bell rings to announce that it is time to
“protect every State against invasion” or to
squash “domestic violence,” there are 1703
men ready at a moment’s notice, including
the 134 in Westralia and the 69 in Tas-
mania. In the U.S., which Australia thought
it was imitating when it drafted its defence
scheme, things are slightly different. The
Federal force is larger, though it is nothing
very formidable. But in addition every
State has its militia or National Guard as
a protection against too much “domestic
violence,” and an astonishing feature of the
case is that, in time of stress, the Federal
authority can seize upon the National Guard,
incorporate it with the regular army, and
send it on divers military errands to all
manner of places. By comparison Aus-
tralia’s method, to say nothing of its 1703
allegedly dependable troops, looks futile.

Mostly About Imports.
The publication of a few more figures helps
to show Australia where it is going, when
it isn’t going to the races to lose its own
or its employer’s money, having taken Satur-
day off for the purpose. The trade statistics
have been issued for the July-September
quarter of the new financial year, and some
of them throw light on the anxiety of the
people across the Pacific to cultivate larger
commercial relations with such an easy mark
as this country is. Details are given con-
cerning the people who bought our butter,
flour, wheat, greasy wool, scoured wool and
tops, cow-meat, sheep-meat and tinned-meat.
These were our exports to Canada
July- July-
September, September,
1923. 1924.
Butter .. ~ ~ None None
Flour .. ~ .. None None
Wheat .. ~ .. None None
Greasy wool .. .. £6530 £1672
Scoured wool .. .. 957 None
Tops None 52,064
Cow meat .. .. None None
Sheep meat .. .. None 1,812
Tinned meat .. .. None None
For the last two complete years for which
figures are supplied our entire dealings with
the Canuck are given thus :
Balance
Bought Sold against
from Canada. to Canada. Australia.
1921- . £3,146,450 £373,570 £2,772,880
1922- 5,064,253 364,732 4,699,521
It doesn’t appear that there is much to be
gained by giving preference to a country
like that. The U.S.A. is also talking about
larger trade relations. The last two avail-
able sets of relations were of this sort:—
Balance
Bought from Sold to against
United States. United States. Australia.
1921- . £18,823,113 £8,314,386 £10,508,727
1922- 24,851,303 '9,630,770 15,220,533
That is another case in which no reciprocity
that the other party is likely to offer will do
much good. What these two extraordinary
customers need, pending more equitable
arrangements, is a quota system applied to
their goods just as the U.S. applies one to
immigrants. For the July-September quar-
ter of 1924 the Commonwealth imported over
£11,000,000 worth more goods than its ex-
ports sufficed to pay for. The natural result
of all this influx was that local wage-earners
had a poor time. In one way or another
this £11,000,000-odd, and the quarter’s in-
terest on the country’s foreign liabilities, is
added to the aggregate foreign debt. Of
course, in consequence of all this importing,
the Customs revenue continues to be re-
markable. But the remarkable revenue is
paper, and a ton of paper wouldn’t pay a
day’s interest in Bondon, though it looks very
nice in the statistics. A contributing cause
of the importing boom which damages Aus-
tralian industry so badly is that private
parties are allowed to sell Australia’s dimin-
ishing gold output abroad, and receive its
value in foreign paper which, having no more
value here than ours has there, only comes
here in the shape of goods. The Common-
wealth parted with £760,917 of gold in the
past quarter, _ and received from abroad only
£760. This is because foreign countries are
not all such drifting asses as this country is.
If the Government took the gold supply and
paid for it in Australian paper there would
be more currency, and it would be the kind
that buys Australian goods instead of the
kind that doesn’t. Then the Government
would accumulate a pile of the substance
that foreign liabilities can be paid with.

Scots Wha Hae.
A Caledonian dinner was held the other
evening in Melbourne, and over the haggis
and the brose the new Caledonian Premier
got this blameless platitude off his soul:—
He did not wish to look about the world to find
a better land than Australia. They .wanted to keep
Australia white and pure, and they could only do
that by guarding it.
As regards the purity, Premier Allan can
jhelp by, among other things, seeing that
.Melbourne is kept supplied with a decent
police force—one which at least wo~’ f eom-
mit burglary with its uniform on. For the
other matter, he might begin-by quitting the
great army of babblers who chatter about
keeping Australia white, for an empty place
has no color save that of the ground, ami
do his bit towards making it white. Even
a State Pfemier can assist, or, at any rate,
he can define his attitude and set an example.
It isn’t possible to "guard” the North with-
out population, and it isn’t possible to get
settlers there on a big scale, to say nothing
of troops when they are wanted, till the
place is joined up by a railway—one railway
to begin with. At least, in Allan’s own
little sphere, the first idea, when it is pro-
posed to settle any spot, is to join it on to
Melbourne by a railway, and if joining isn’t
good policy for the N. Territory it is a fool’s
game for Victoria. Having gone so far into
discussion of the Federal job of ‘‘guarding”
Australia, it was poor business to stop
at emaciated generalities. Melbourne has one
parish-minded organ which is never tired of
denouncing the South-to-Nortli line as a
“desert railway,” though Central Australia
is no desert except when the railway is in
question. Sydney has another which recently
gave space to a savage denunciation of all
and any railways across Australia, alleging
that the country’s best defence is the vast
distances, which will give the walking invader
sore feet. Canada, the U.S., Mexico, Argen-
tina and other countries have built lines from
sen to sea, and chanced the invader getting
a free ride, but Australia has a way of its
own. The popular conception of the Federal
Government is that it is an institution for
raising money on the credit of all the States,
and spending it for the benefit of the States
with the strongest pull. Petty localism of
that sort leaves the Northern Territory as
much out of account as if it was Northern
China or Eastern Hell, anything spent on
it being considered as stolen from some
sturdy mendicant in the South. It is quite
possible, therefore, that Premier Allan
would have caused a roar of execration which
would have been heard at both ends of
Collins-street if he had gone into details
about the best way of “guarding” Australia,
but a Scot should take no account of roars.

The Birth of Another Bankrupt Baby.
The weekly N.S.W. railway item (it was
Henty to Bull Plain last week)
Construction of a railway from Canowindra to
Gregra at a cost of £216,198 was recommended in
a report tabled in the Assembly last night by the
Public Works Committee.
Canowindra lies west from Sydney, and its
trade goes to Sydney as a matter of course.
It has already two places in the list of money-
losing railways :
Loss
Loss per Mile
Last Year. Last Year.
Cowra-Canowindra .. £5,397 £225
Canowindra-Eugowra .. 12,508 481
It lies surrounded by railways—north, north-
east, west, south and south-east, none very
far off. Its own line is a branch from the
Demondrille-Blayney section, the prize
money-dropper of Ma State, and itself a spur
jutting into a triangle of lines. The follow-
ing are the principal of the closely-surround-
ing “permanent and reproductive” routes: —
Loss
Loss per Mile
Last Year. Last Year.
Demondrille-Blayney £102,196 £921
Koorawatha-Grenfell .. 5,857 183
Stockinbingal-Forbes . . 5,800 65
The district is practically a cobweb of steel
rails. If it was proposed to extend one of
the northern lines to a port on the coast,
and that line was anything like so bad a
financial derelict as the Cowra-Canowindra
or Canowindra-Eugowra concerns, and a
quarter as bad as their dissipated parent,
the Demondrille-Blayney bankrupt, there
would go up what the late Henry Parkes
once described as “an ’owl of ’oly ’orror to
the ’eavens.” The Moree-Inverell railway, up
in New England, lost only at the rate of £177
per mile last year, and is an improving pro-
position. Yet when its extension to Coif’s
Harbor was recently suggested the Public
Works Committee was almost insulted at the
immorality of the idea. To recommend fur-
ther expenditure on such a profitless venture
was contrary to its principles. In fact, its
shriek of honest wrath echoes in the hills
even now, and disturbs the cows on windless
nights. And if the P. W. Committee had
recommended building along the Inverell-
Coast route, Parliament would have turned
the scheme down, and it would have been all
the same in the long and crooked run. Yet
the craving, strictly by word of mouth, for
decentralisation is almost as unanimous
among politicians as the desire for food.

Soviet and Single-tax.
Dear Bulletin, —Y\ nen P. B. Meggy (B.
4/12/’24) calms down a little I would like
a word with him. I attach it below, to be
read to the gentleman when you think the
moment opportune:—
Certainly I say that the single-tax was attempted
in Russia, and that it isn’t attempted now because
it egregiously failed. The issue of paper money and
the seizure of accumulated wealth helped the old
chariot along for a while, but these weren’t taxes.
The Government didn’t tax mineowners, shipowners,
importers, wholesale and retail dealers, bankers, etc.,
because it was, or tried to be, all these itself. But
it taxed the land, or the man on it.
It isn’t correct to say that “the Soviet confis-
cated the land, turned the owners out of their homes
and handed the land to the peasants, leaving the
owners to starve.” The peasants owned about 36
per cent, of the land before the revolution, and they
remained. The rest of the soil was largely imperial,
State and municipal property, and whatever changes
were made in the nominal ownership the tenants re-
mained with no more change than the war brought
about. The noble landlords who possessed about 26
per cent, of the country were “turned out of their
homes,” and a good many starved, but again the
tenants mostly stayed. They were simply told that
in future the State would be their landlord, and
took little notice. Some of them took none. The
former “so-called owner,” when he had been called
an owner, was left “in full possession of his land,
allowing him to cultivate it to the fullest extent,
and to retain the whole of the produce,” subject to
payment of the rent (“economic rent,” Mr. P. R.
Meggy calls it), and so was the former so-called
tenant. I don’t think the wonderful Henry George
could have done more if he had got from theory
to practice.
The Soviet Government then tried to do what, I
suppose, any Single-tax Government must do, -whether
it has set up as the sole banker, railroad-owner, etc.,
or not. It tried to collect enough plain rent, .or
“economic rent,” or any old rent (enough single-
tax, in short) each year to run the State machine.
If the collection was made in kind instead of in cash,
that saved the taxpayer a lot of trouble. The
scheme worked badly and the people starved. Perhaps
they would do the same here if Australia was Henry
Georgcd. The restoration of the right of private trad-
ing and other relaxations presumably made available
a new body of taxpayers, so Russia Henry Georges
no more. Only the debris of the faith remains.
Mr. Meggy denies fiercely that Russia ever was
Freetrade because of the Government trade monopoly.
He badly wants to know “how trade can be free
when the people are prohibited from indulging in
it?” Well, a cyclop,edic definition of Mr. Meggy’s
pet superstition is that it consists in “absence of
differential duties, and of artificial encouragements
such as bounties, by which the home producer is
favored as compared with the foreigner in the same
department.” Russia had that. Another definition
is that “the essence of Freetrade is equality and
uniformity in the financial treatment of home, colo-
nial and foreign produce of the same kind.” Russia
had that also.
I only once had a talk with the infallible Henry
George cn fiscal matters, and he condescended to
enlighten my ignorance by telling me that duties
were not required to restrict imports, because the
only way in which they were paid for was by
exports, and the situation adjusted itself. I said
if he included the export of our lOU as a legiti-
mate method of adjustment his theory might be all.
right, but otherwise it left Australia’s foreign debt
unexplained. I forget what his reply was, but it
was no more satisfactory than the rest of his dreams.
Wishing Mr. Meggy an illuminated Christ-
mas and an enlightened New Year, I re-
main, yours truly, Solomon Malapkop.

The Recalcitrant Reg. Councillor.
Ordinarily there is nothing explosive about
Australian Leg. Councils, but just now they
are being regarded with emotions correspond-
ing to those excited by a volcano which sud-
denly resumes business long after it was
thought to have become tame. Unmindful of the
Queensland Chamber’s fate in 1921, and with
the Senate’s rejection of the Lessee Tax
Bill to encourage them, they have laid rude
hands on a host of Government bills. In
some cases the maltreatment was invited by
the authors of the proposals, who would
have been embarrassed had the Councillors
been compliant; in other cases it was un-
expected and unwarranted. The Tas. Upper
House mangled a money bill, and paid for
its folly by seeing the royal assent given to
the enactment as passed by the Assembly,
after an interchange of messages between
Government House and Downing-street. The
N. S. Wales institution threw out the Local
Government Amendment Bill, one of the
measures provided for in the pact between
Fuller’s Nationalists and their candid and
uncordial friends the Progressives. In the
Westralian Second Chamber the blow fell
on the State Lotteries Bill, while drastic
amendments have been made to Arbitration
and Workers’ Compensation Amendment
Bills, the latter of which measures sought
to make the employer liable for injuries sus-
tained by an employee on his way home
from work, even if he was drunk at the
time or was knocked out while spooning
with another man’s girl. And the S.A.
Upper House lias rejected Labor bills for
the abolition of titles and the property fran-
chise, for Proportional Representation and
reduction of members, and for the adoption
of the British provision whereby measures
passed in three successive sessions of the
Lower House become law, Another Place
notwithstanding. No S.A. Government has
ever been more despitefully treated, and in
theory there ought to be a popular outcry
against the Council. But none was discern-
ible during the Barossa by-election, although
Burossa is reckoned a democratic constitu-
ency. and the Government sent 16 Labor
Parliamentarians to Gawler, the Labor
stronghold, to do their best. As a matter
of fact, the Opposition candidate polled
nearly 200 more votes at Gawler than he
did at the general election, when Labor won
two of the three Barossa seats, and the
Government nominee was beaten by 069
votes in a poll of 6795. Perhaps Barossa
took the view that the Government was not
serious about the rejected measures. One
way of proving the contrary would be to
submit them to a referendum before next
session ; and the same gpplics to the position
in Westralia. If the popular vote was in
favor of the Government the Council would
have to climb down or write its own death-
warrant. However, the Labor people have
gone cold on the referendum, although it
used to figure prominently in their plans for
establishing Utopia in Australia. It doesn’t
tit in with machine politics and bossism.

Tasmania’s Constitutional Imbroglio.
From one of the little island’s constitution-
alists :
Thanks to the astonishing recklessness or stupidity
of the Leg. Council, which claims the right to
amend money bills, the Lyons Government is still
in charge here. When the Fee-Fo-Fum Chamber
returned the Appropriation Bill to the Assembly,
mutilated almost beyond recognition in regard to
salaries of public servants (fixed by a Salaries
Board, by the way), Lyons asked the House to affirm
that the Council had no right to amend money bills,
and to authorise the Speaker to present the bill to
the Administrator for his assent in the precise
form in which it had first left the Assembly. This
proposal left the Opposition breathless for a while,
but eventually an amendment was tabled to the
effect that the amendments made in the Appropria-
tion Bill in Another Place be dealt with in the
ordinary constitutional manner, as provided in the
Standing Orders. A vigorous debate ensued, the
Ministerialists fighting to get the matter before the
Governor in the terms of the Premier’s motion, and
the Opposition striving to prevent such a happening.
The upshot was that Chief Secretary Guy moved a
further amendment adding the words “and that the
Government be authorised to take the necessary
steps to obtain a definite ruling as to the powers
of the Leg. Council in regard to money bills.”
Lyons, presumably under pressure from his own
followers, accepted the compromise, the Opposition
accepted it, and it was carried unanimously and with
Opposition cheers. One obviously relieved member
piped up “0 Happy Day.” But the joy was pre-
mature. Trouble immediately arose when a com-
mittee of three, which included Lyons, drew up and
presented the usual “reasons” for disagreeing with
the Council. The House declined to accept the
“reasons”: said they weren’t the true reasons. For
instance, the first paragraph of the committee's
report declared that the Assembly was rejecting the
Council’s amendments to the Budget because the
Council had no right to amend money bills. As
this amounted to a reassertion of Lyons's motion
which the Assembly had negatived, it certainly was
objectionable. The Opposition said so. “Very
well,” said Lyons, “count me off the committee, and
appoint a new committee —one that will draw up
reasons satisfactory to those Assemblymen who want
to crawl to the Council!” Subsequently the
other two members of the Committee drew up an
amended report. This was accepted by a majority of
the Assembly. Lyons and a few others protesting, and
managers from both Houses met in conference. By
this time the Premier had given up all hope of
inducing a majority of the House to stand up to
the Other Place. But the unexpected happened.
Instead of taking the opportunity to back out of
an awkward situation, the Ancients declined to
abate more than the veriest tittle of their original
demands, though the conference of managers argued
for the best part of a day and night. The managers
reported their non-success to the Assembly. Ministers
discovered that several Oppositionists were now feci*
ing disgusted with the uncompromising attitude of
the Council, and laid their plans accordingly. Lyons
moved that the Speaker be authorised to present tin
bill to Lieut.-Governor Nicholls for his assent.
Notwithstanding that this proposal was practically
identical with his original motion, which tho
Assembly had repudiated with much noise and
bitterness of tongue, it was agreed to by 18 to 11.
And, after consultation by cable with Ambry, the
new Secretary of State for the Colonies, the
Lieut.-Governor signed the bill. Thus the minority
Labor Government of the Speck will go down to
history as the first Administration on earth to
dish an elective Upper House by ignoring it. Lyons
has indisputably handled the crisis cleverly, and the
prospects of converting his minority into a majority
when he goes to the country next year are good.

A Dry Wet-Nurse for the People Who
Matter Least.
In Washington, the capital of Dry America,
there were more than 9000 arrests for drun-
kenness last year, and an increase of 1244 in
the number of violations of the liquor law,
making a total of over 14,000 for the
period. With a wdiole fleet employed on the
coast to stop rum-running and a whole army
engaged in chasing the bootlegger ashore, the
results seem pretty bad. But the person
with faith in prohibition will keep on in tho
old track at all costs and in spite of all evi-
dences. The whole dry area is having exactly-
the experience which the State of Maine had
in its half-century of nominal drought. By
keeping up a tremendous agitation, spending
vast sums of money and continually shout-
ing that success is at hand, it is possible
to reduce drinking of alcoholic liquors under
prohibitory national law to nearly the same
level as is maintained under license.
Under district no-license the results were
rather different. It was convincingly proved
that alcohol could be driven with some suc-
cess from a limited area, though its sales
may have been correspondingly increased in
other places; but once the whole nation is
brought under a law which one-third of its
people condemn, the real trouble begins. In
America it has become almost a matter of
honor to break the law. Thousands of people
who formerly drank little now drink much
as a protest against an interference with
their liberty. American fiction, which must
in some measure reflect the conditions known
to its readers, is full of references to this
very thing. On the other hand, some Ameri-
can manufacturers applaud the dry legisla-
tion, in spite of its failures, on the ground
that the workers are now more regular in
their habits and more to be depended on.
Some factories, which in the wet days never
found it worth while to open on Monday, 1
now work a full week. This is about the
only valid claim the prohibitionists can
advance for continuing a law which has been
torn in so many places : the extraordinary
working man of the United States —a blend
of about 30 European nationalities, with the
lowest types strongly in evidence —has been
greatly benefited. If this is to be regarded
as a gain and the general principle accepted
of helping the lower human types at the
expense of the personal freedom of the
higher, prohibition may be taken as a direct
challenge to evolution. But in the long run
there must be some remarkable results; for
nature did not toil to produce a man worthy
of his liberty to have her processes thwarted
in this way. The higher types, becoming
lawless through their contempt for a law
they refuse to accept, must in the end assert
that attitude by making themselves masters
over the lower types. Any form of anarchy
—and a state of anarchy exists when law
is in contempt—throws up tyrants who rule
for themselves and their class alone. The
United States prohibition experiment will
look a poor thing in history if the boasted
freedom of the republic is thrown away to
help a few descendants of backward races
to get to work on Monday morning. Drink
may or may not be all the curse it is repre-
sented as being; but law that strikes at the
roots of liberty can be no blessing, however
well
The Case of Hardwood.
There may be no rigging of the market or
secret understanding in the Australian hard-
wood trade, but the price-lists certainly
make curious reading. Hardwood, unclassi-
fied and containing a good deal of stuff that
is by no means choice for any purpose, is
sold at prices very little short of those
asked for picked softwoods which have been
brought 7000 miles by sea. That might, of
course, be fair enough if the local timber
had grown so scarce as to be hard to get.
Transport along a few miles of bush track
may easily cost more than 10 thousand miles
of carriage by sea. Admittedly, a good
deal of the best hardwood is increasingly
difficult to get; but that would scarcely
account for an increase of some hundreds per
cent, since 1914, whereas Maoriland rimu
—also increasingly _ difficult to get—lias
shown no such magnificent advance. Second-
class hardwood is still about the cheapest
thing in the market; but, then, second-class
hardwood is about the last thing in the
world any carpenter wishes to use. As mat-
ters stand, it looks as if the millers who
saw hardwood had entered into an under-
standing to prevent any extensive local use
of the common good timbers grown nearest
at hand. Such timbers, it is true, are heavy
and difficult to work: but their breaking
strain is so much higher than that of the
woods commonly used that their employ-
ment is warranted in much larger quantities.
But their prices must be lower to make

them popular; and a great deal better and
finer use could be made of them if the timber
people gave a little more attention to them.
The very finest Australian flooring is cut
from the jarrah—flooring that has been
brought to the highest pitch of fit and
polish. The so-called Tasmanian oak—really
a not very high-class stringy-bark—is put
to fine furniture uses; and there are one or
two other exceptions to the general rule.
But for the most part the hardwoods get
a bad deal, are cut more carelessly and pre-
sented more roughly than other timbers, and
generally are regarded as good for fencing
or for “knocking up” a rough shed, but
hopeless for more important building. As
a plain fact, hardwood homes could be built
throughout as finely finished in every detail
as the beautiful jarrah floors; and, treated
in this way, a house built of the local stuff
would be infinitely superior to any built of
the imported timbers. But while so high
a price is asked for such badly-handled
material the whole road is closed against
the experiment.
More Tomfullery.
At the Sydney municipal election Labor-
Socialism won 11 seats with 13,849 votes,
whereas it took 24,615 votes to elect 11
Nationalists, or Civic Reformers as they pre-
fer to be called. In addition, four Labor
aldermen were returned unopposed for wards
with 6651 electors, at least 10 per cent, of
whom would have voted non-Labor had the
seats been contested, while, judging by
what happened in other wards where Labor-
socialists were elected, 30 or 40 per cent,
wouldn’t have bothered to mark ballot-papers.
In effect, the party with the minority of
votes- —and its supporters were largely lodgers
and Council employees, whereas the other
side were nearly all ratepayers—emerged
four seaU< to the good, which means that it
■will be able to run Sydney for the next three
years at its own sweet will, or that of the
Municipal Employees’ Union. The Civic Re-
formers are blaming the Government for their
discomfiture, and the Government is blaming
the Civic Reformers. The latter are culpable
to the extent that they have been wrangling
since December, 1922, when the “breakaway”
aldermen put Gilpin into the Mayoral chair,
vice W. P. McEliione, with the aid of Labor
votes; but their quarrels wouldn’t have been
disastrous had the Government taken the
simple precaution of passing an effective
voting measure. That the Fullers stupidly
neglected to do, in spite of repeated urgings,
and although it was recently shown in South
Australia that the first-past-the-post system
gives Labor-Socialism an immense advantage
when its opponents are divided. Again, the
Government showed pitiful weakness in let-
ting the election go on while* a Royal Commis-
sioner was wrestling with the standing mys-
tery of how some Sydney aldermen get a
living. The charges and admissions made at
the inquiry, even in its unfinished state, were
sufficient to warrant the cancellation of the
poll and the placing of the city under
Commissioners until order had been educed
out of malodorous disorder. Most of the
Sydney newspapers favored this course, and
a vast majority of the ratepayers would have
approved, but the Government lacked the
necessary courage or nous. Incidentally, if
the belated investigation w r as designed to
damage the Municipal Labor party in the
eyes of the ratepayers, it failed of its pur-
pose, for the alderman who admitted having
received a present was not a Labor man, and
the accusation against a prominent Labor
alderman didn’t come on until the electors
had delivered their verdict. If Fuller and
Co. don’t handle their own election arrange-
ments better than they managed those of
the Civic Reformers, they are in for a sultry
time.

While Victorian Judges are forced to order
the birch-rod for violent robbers, Labor in
South Aus. is trying wdiat jam will do for
the burglar and the garrotter. Prisoners
there are to work no more than seven and a
quarter hours, and to receive six shillings
a week. Men serving longer sentences may
after the seventh week spend half their
wages on fruit, jam and tobacco. It is not
quite clear why the small offender has to go
smokeless and the really bad man gets a
pipe; but the idea may be that the criminal
of the blacker sort will seek gaol for the
home comforts it contains and keep perma-
nently away from plunder and the hardship
of carrying off his loot. Anyhow, the crimi-
nal vote should be assured to the Labor
party.

Ley, the blunderer of the N. S. Wales Gov-
ernment. has now got its Prisons-Depart-
ment seething. Urquhart, the Controller, is
to retire shortly, and Ley has introduced a
country P.M., without any knowledge at all
of prison work, to understudy the part. By
years of intelligent work in the service
George Steele had earned his position of
Deputy-Controller, and in the greatest crisis
the Department has had to face in recent
years—the outbreak at Bathurst—it was he
who was hurried forward to deal with the
ugly situation. He handled it admirably, and
might reasonably have expected that this made
his promotion sure. Unless a case can be
made out against the second man’s ap-
pointment to the chief man’s place in any
department, the second man ought to
get it when it becomes available. It
has not been easy to attract a good class of
man for the minor jobs in the Prisons De-
partment ; and if the Government goes out-
side the service for its front-rankers it is
going to be less easy in the future. The
latest appointment is wrong in principle: if
Steele is not the right man to be Control-
ler, he should not have been appointed
Deputy-Controller. But the Bathurst affair
suggests very loudly that he is the right
man.

When T. J. Smith, M.L.C., of N. S.
Wales, recently broke into the long-drawn-
out ballot-box inquiry and told Theodore
he didn’t think much of him as a judge, and
that his court had no legal standing, he was
stating a case which has long kept the public
wondering. The affair of the faked ballot-
boxes was criminal, not merely political;
and the right of political parties to hold
criminal investigations is one that has never
been conceded. It is illegal to run any sort
of service for the delivery of letters in oppo-
sition to the Federal Post Office ; yet the State
and Federal authorities have both winked
at the setting up of private courts of justice
to try those who are alleged to have entered
into a conspiracy which was clearly criminal.
On the precedent established any group of
citizens should have the right to capture a
supposed murderer and try him under the
greenwood tree in the good old-fashioned

manner of stage brigands. It may be that,
owing to its complications, official justice is
afraid to touch the ballot-box business, on the
ground that it could get no results. As
there is very little likelihood of getting re-
sults in any other way, this contention seems
futile. It is not a question of how a certain
group of people may stand in the eyes of a
Labor Conference, but of how individual citi-
zens stand in relation to the community.

From a mere taxpayer:—
When the s.s. Themistocles was at Brisbane in
October, a wharf-laborer was caught in the act of
pilfering half a box of butter. In a thoughtless
moment an officer of the ship handed him over
to the police, as a result of which action there was
a sympathetic strike, and the Themistocles left
port with many tons of cargo still on the wharf.
Travelling on the Queensland coast that month, I was
told by another officer that the next Aberdeen liner
to reach Brisbane would infallibly be declared
“black.” This was weeks before the overtime strike
was ordered by the Waterside Workers’ Federation.
Sure enough, when the Euripides—“the next Aber-
deen liner” of the prophecy—arrived at Brisbane
on November 27, the wharfies refused to discharge
the 600 tons of cargo she carried for Brisbane or
load the 2000 tons of Queensland grain she was to
lift for the State Wheat Board. Incidentally, while
she lay idle, a special committee appointed by the
State Government was “inquiring into the causes of
unemployment on the Brisbane waterfront.” Of
course the committee didn’t tell the whole truth in
plain Australian, but it did say that as many as
600 members of the waterfront union (out of 1450)
had received payments under the Unemployment
Insurance Act in one month.
Evidence of the crime against the country
committed through the N.S.W. Soldiers’ Set-
tlement Aet continues to accumulate. One
of its latest victims has been telling the
Registrar in Bankruptcy that he went on a
farm near Grenfell on an advance of £625,
paying no deposit and having no capital.
Neither had he any experience of farming,
and the branch gave him no help in selecting
his block; it just shoved him on to it at a
value greatly in excess of local estimate.
The farm carried a fine crop of small scrub
and weeds, and the local Pastures Protection
Board’s inspector warned him against it. To
get the land into condition to grow crops re-
quired money, and that wasn’t available. He
had three bad seasons and the Soldiers’
Settlement Branch to battle against, and the
last was a long way the worst. He finished
up £2500 in debt, having, apparently, been
unable to pay anyone anything. Presum-
ably he ate himself into insolvency, for, out-
side the weeds and the scrub, he doesn’t seem
to have been able to grow or raise anything.
There was a mortgage, but even a returned
soldier can’t eat a mortgage.
“Country PUd” : It is quite true that the
out-back teacher is expected to possess a
variety of attainments (B. 20/11/’24). It
is all in his day’s work to render first aid to
broken limbs, diagnose sickness, recommend
homely remedies, run the dance and sport-
ing events of the neighborhood, and be secre-
tary of the local football, tennis and cricket
clubs, as well as a race-club official. In
addition I don’t mind witnessing signatures
to legal documents, fixing up postal votes
and advising applicants for old-age pensions.
My trouble is that the Vic. Education De-
partment is beginning to insist that its
teachers should possess other accomplish-
ments besides pedagogic ones. In the Edu-
cation Gazette for October a vacancy for
a lady assistant in a country school was
advertised. Added to the notice was a re-
quest from the district that “a teacher who
has knowledge of the Girl Guide movement
should be appointed.” No doubt Girl Guid-
ing is a very fine idea, but to be consistent
the Department should also print requests
for “an outstanding Methodist local
preacher” or “an all-round sport” or “a good
footballer.” Did the Department officially
identify itself with such an appeal because
the Governor’s lady and other society dames
are enthusiastic supporters of the movement
—“so naice for the girls, you know”? Com-
munity service is good, good for the teacher,
good for his (or her) pupils, good for every-
body. But when it is insisted upon as a
prominent qualification for a teacher, the
good ends; social service becomes a trade,
a matter for sale and barter.

“Black Bonnet” from Farthest North:—
Tnere is a lot of discussion about the invasion
of the North by the Mediterranean races. That they
are coming here in hundreds, a steady influx, is
undeniable; and in most cases they are making
good. They do not ask for assistance even in
coming, except from their own people; and it is
significant that their own people both encourage
and help. They have a system of co-operative
working which is resulting in the acquisition of
much property, mostly sugar farms. It is greatly
to their credit that they are not content to remain
laborers all their lives, but are willing to make
great sacrifices to enable them to establish homes and
become independent. The Australian laborer rarely
looks beyond wages—good wages. There are excep-
tions, of course, but as a rule the Italian laborer
looks to wages merely to empower him to pay the
first instalment on his farm or business. And they
kept their eyes wide open for new ventures. At present
there is talk of a large purchase of land north of
Cooktown by these people for peanut growing. This
land has been for sale for a very long time, at a
most reasonable figure, and its suitability for peanuts
is proved. But the Italians seem to be the only
people with confidence to take it up. They propose
to work it co-operatively—a plan that for some
mysterious reason does not appeal to Australians.
An impression is abroad, by the way, that Italians
do not care what they eat, and how little. This
is merely silly. They live as well as we do; in
fact, they look upon good and plentiful food as
a factor in enabling them to do more and better
work. Unfortunately, they do not assimilate readily
with Australians, and remain Italian for many years.
Everyone up here realises that those in authority
are not in earnest about migration from Britain.
Many Australians (to be frank) labor under the
delusion that the fewer people there are in the
country, the more food, clothes, amusement and
money for themselves —a cave-day superstition. Of
course Ministers know better, but it is easier to
shelve responsibility than to assume it, and there is
much shelving done of Far Northern interests. I had
an illuminating experience lately. I wrote an article
on the Far North for a widely circulated English
weekly. From the date of its publication I began
to receive letters from people in England, Scotland,
Wales, India and Africa, who asked where they could
get information of the country—land available,
prospects, etc. The letters were, generally speaking,
from people with young families —farmers, carpenters,
builders, electricians and other tradesmen. Some
were young single men, and in every case they were
prepared to pay their own expenses, but required advice
and definite information. I wrote to the responsible
Minister. He replied through his secretary that he
was very much interested, and referred me to the
local C.P.S. The utter futility of it!

A recent statement made by the chairman
of the N. S. Wales Congregational Union
that Communism cannot flourish where the
Christian faith is the guiding principle wants
some explanation. It is doubtful whether
the Christian faith has anything to do with
the failure. In the New Testament it is
recorded that the earliest church in Judea
held all things in common. The system
failed bitterly; but the religious zeal be-
hind the movement should have kept it alive
if it had possessed any virtues of its own—
actually within 20 years the church in Judea
was being supported on alms gathered from
the non-Communistic Greek cities. The big
question is whether a plan of life which could
not work even with apostles in charge and
saints for its rank and file is likely to suc-
ceed with the sort of people who represent
it politically in Australia in charge of the
machinery.

Remarks of a Vic. tobacco-grower:—
Scullin, M.H.R., inquired in the House of Reps,
just before the session closed why Australian tobacco-
growers were receiving considerably reduced prices
for their leaf this year. While he was about it
he might have asked a question as to what precau-
tions, if any, were taken to prevent plant diseases
coming in with the raw stuff from abroad? Last
season, which was about the worst on record, growers
found quite a number of new afflictions, which were
not traceable to bluemould ; one in particular bore a
striking resemblance to the dreaded American wilt. In
the U.S.A. everything possible is done to prevent
wilt, bluemould and so forth from being carried from
one State to another, but there is no restriction on
foreigners who aim at sending polluted leaf to the
Commonwealth. This country keeps open house.
Given a fair deal, the Australian tobacco-grower, who
doesn’t ask for doles, control, or anything of the sort,
will, in a few years’ time, raise all the Indian weed
consumed on this continent, and obviate the neces-
sity for dragging £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 worth
of raw tobacco from the other side of the Pacific
every year. But the Governments, State and Federal,
will have to see that he gets that fair deal.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Westralia’s Labor Government established
a new precedent when its State police were
instructed not only to withhold protection
from ordinary citizens who incurred the fury
of the maritime strikers at Fremantle, but
to withhold it from Federal officials who had
business with shipping. If such Ministries
become common the Federal authority may
have to get an army, and find or take ex-
tended powers to deal with incipient civil
wars, and with persons who encourage them.
In 1923 every State and also the Can-
berra region had fewer births than the year
before, despite the baby bonus. Only the
N. Territory showed an improvement. In five
States and the N.T. the position was worse
in the first half of 1924 than in the first half
of 1923, the ’fall being from 67,870 to 66,030.
For the January-June section of 1924 the
birth-rate, in proportion to population, was
the poorest on record—2292 per 100.000 per
annum', while in 1918, when about the larg-
est number of possible fathers was away in
Flanders and many more were invalided,
the rate was 2525 per 100,000. A probable
explanation is that the craze for putting the
population of a State into one bloated city
leaves little room for birth and nOt much
for marriage, though death, which take? up
little space, can always be arranged. It. is
wonderful how many dead people can live
on one acre. The Congestion curse may ex-
plain whv in Sydney, the real monster metro-
polis, the rate of baby-arrival, which was
2789 per 100,000 people in 1913, was only
at the rate of 2199 per 100,000 in the first
half of 1924. Sydney had been growing fast
and suffocating its child in the interval.
The Commonwealth had, at last June, lent
to the State Governments £77,523,628,
partly out of the Notes Fund, but chiefly
money it had borrowed itself. Most of it
went for two purposes—for building rail-
ways and_other public works in the compara-
tively crowded south-east, and for settling
returned soldiers there. The place was
selected because the Commonwealth had nd
land there to give away, and purchased land
was dear. The fact that the Federal autho-
rity had half a million square miles of ita
own to settle appears never to have struck
the wooden images in charge.
In 1921-22 the Commonwealth line of
steamers consumed £1,171,000 more than it
earned. In 1922-23 the loss was about
£4500 a day, Sundays and strike-days ifi-
eluded. Last year the book value Of the
steamers was written down from <ub,UUU
to £4,718,000, the burden of interest and de-
preciation charges being correspondingly de-
duced (at the expense of Consolidated Re-
venue) from £1,428,510 to £420,000; but
even so the results have been so awful,
though not yet specifically announced, that
the Board is reported to have urged tile sale
of the fleet for what it will fetch. The
Bulletin cordially supports the motion, lo
lose a power of public money in order that
insolent importations like Walsh may expose
the Government to the ridicule and contempt
of the assorted ruffianism of the community
every few weeks is the dead limit of idiocy.
THE POOR FISH!
THE POLITICIANS : “The fish can please themselves now whether they bite or not if
they don't bite we'll dynamite ’em!"
When the Fremantle waterside shindy was
at its briskest Prime Minister Bruce rained
long telegrams on the Westralian Labor Pre-
mier asking why his police refused protec-
tion to Federal port officers in tlie execution
of tlieir medical and other duties. Getting
an answer from Collier was like extracting a
cat from a bag by the caudal end, but at
last lie replied: “Services mentioned have
now resumed. Situation much easier.”
Even if the situation had partially righted
itself Collier shirked the question why his
police had been ordered not to do their work.
At Brisbane the position was that the
Wyandra had been declared “black” over a
small matter of overtime, and was held up.
Then the union bosses ran amok, and refused
to let the Wyandra’s mostly perishable cargo
be taken on by a vessel which wasn’t black
or even pale grey. As a result £75,000 of
goods belonging to people who hadn’t quar-
relled with the union proceeded to go bad. Ail
attempts to see Premier Theodore on the
subject failed; It might almost be thought
that these Premiers were scared.
The latest Sydney alderman to be men-
tioned in connection with an alleged attempt
to collect bribe money stated in his evidence
that he was a commission-agent, but had no
office, which suggested a young and modest
business. He added that he devoted most
of his time to his unpaid occupation as
chairman of the municipal Labor party,
which suggested a neglected business. The
metropolis being really a trading concern
like the railways, it would be better to pay
a few experts, as the railways do, than take
advantage Of struggling amateurs in this
fashion, especially if they have wives and
children to support, But for the incurable
ordinariness Of the Fuller. Ministry some-
thing might be done to abate the sin and the
anomaly.
The announcemeht that United States bil-
lionaires have made a general offer to lend
money to Governments and institutions in
Australia is vague but tremendous. It reads
like a tentative offer to buy country, or
take it on perpetual lease. With a trifle
of encouragement an offer to purchase the
Australian railways may be looked for. Uncle
Samuel bought Alaska in 1867, and the
Danish West Indies in .1917; and with huge
cash accumulations the desire to invest in
other desirable estates is doubtless strong in
his breast.
Ex-Treasurer McPhairson’s face was a
study while Alec Peacock, Allan’s equal-
in-ali-things, was explaining to Vic. Assembly
his alterations of Labor's income-tax pro-
posals. By the time the Treasurer was
finished, McPherson found himself agreeing
with Prondergast that there wasirt much
difference between the Labor and Composite
Cabinet schemes. In the lower reaches the
only difference is that the allowance tor
wives is £5O instead of Prendergast’s £lOO.
As regards income from personal exertion,
the minimum taxable amount is to remain
at £2Ol, while the exemption is to be £2OO
in place of £l5O, and is to gradually fade
away till £2200 is reached. The rate is to
rise gradually from 3d. in tlie £_ till £->OOO
is passed; then there is to" be a fixed toll of
Is. 6d. on the excess over that figure. On
property 75 p.c. extra (instead of the pre-
sent double rates) is to be exacted. In place
of letting 60.000 people go scot free, as
Prondergast proposed. 48,000 who now con-
tribute something will escape. Companies
other than mutual-life cos. will have to shell
out Is. 3d. in the £ instead of Is. —£166,000
altogether of the additional £360,000 pro-
posed to be extracted.
From the N. S. Wales Gallery
Nationalist R. W. D. Weaver, in announcing his
retirement from North Sydney and politics, said
that politics interfered with his business, and there
was also the cost of the next election. The reasons
do not come well from Weaver. When the Storey
Government raised members’ salaries to £875 p.a.,
Weaver grew fearfully indignant, and declared that
his share of the increase would be paid back into
the Treasury. Service and Sacrifice were his ideais,
not Politics and Pelf. And North Sydney, being one
of those constituencies that like things tony as long
as they’re getting ’em cheap, put him top of the
poll at the following election. Then the portfolios
passed Weaver one by one. He missed the Chairman-
ship of Committees. Finally, he ran in the Parlia-
mentary Consolation Stakes known as the ballot
for the Public Works Committee (four to be elected)
and didn’t get a place. Now he finds that the game
isn’t worth while. Perhaps it isn’t if you are
a little above the ordinary—it sometimes pays
better to be just ordinary.
Reporting on its first year's operations,
the S. Aus. Commission which now admin-
isters the Murray River irrigation areas an-
nounces a loss of £93,163, “assuming that
the total outstandings on June 30 for rates,
rent, etc., will be collected.” As regards
soldier-settlement on irrigation areas, the
“net” loss is now reckoned at £426.734.
Irrigation for fruit-farms on the lower Mur-
ray was to have done wonders for Australia.
In practice it has proved as sure a way of
losing public money as running a line of
Government steamers.
Considering itself quite sufficiently stocked
with mixed races, Britain now permits no
alien to come in with a view to laboring in
"the country unless he has the written permis-
sion of the Minister. The U.S. has also been
further tightening up its system. It col-
lected 222,260 Italians in 1921, but it has
cut down the admissions to less than 3900
per annum, and the same treatment is being
served out all round. Wherefore there will
be more interest taken in Empty Australia
than ever before, and if the Government
doesn’t get British people in it will have
increasing trouble to keep cheaper folk out.
Canadian “business interests” may pos-
sibly impress Australia with their shrieks
that, unless its Parliament ratifies the dis-
astrous reciprocity treaty which has been
drafted, this country’s name will be Mud and
its reputation a bloteh in the Book of
Nations. They wouldn’t impress the British
Government with any such threat; for that
Government has its own way of doing things.
It has informed the Soviet Government that
the loan-guarantee agreement which Clumsy
Macdonald signed won’t be ratified, and that
it wouldn’t have been ratified even apart
from the Zinovieff letter advocating mutiny
in the British forces.
The Allan-Peacock Budget substitutes a
tax of 1 p.c. on the turnover of McShortodds
for the stamp duty of from 6d. to Id. on bet-
ting tickets. It is expected to get as much
from the new impost as was got from
the old—£lsl,ooo p.a.—the idea being
that the money risked on Vic. race-
courses has reached the staggering total
of £15.000.000 p.a. Labor proposed to
remit £76,000 p.a. by not re-enacting the
super-tax on tickets. The men with the bags
clamored for something more “equitable”
than they were getting, and now it has come
with a vengeance. It is costing those on
the hill at Fiemington Bd. or 9d. in the £
under the ticket system, while the rake-off
from odds-yellers in the stand reserve is only
2d. or 3d.' in the £. Now, possibly, the
biggest grabbers will curse Labor for stirring
up things at all.
In the struggle to avoid subdividing N. S.
Wales the County Council was introduced.
It was the red herring dragged across the
track. The idea is that certain shires and
municipalities may coagulate so as to make
four regular layers of legislation—municipal,
county council, State and Federal —instead
of three, as there is now and as there would
be under a New State system. Apparently
there is no earthly hope of forming a county
council for anv big purpose, such as making
a new port available, but three or four have
been formed for one minor job apiece. At
present 33 local bodies are combining to
form an extra Parliament to run a water-
power scheme for Grafton and surroundings.
It seems hardly sufficient work to keep the
new Legislature busy, but if more work was
provided it might lead to decentralisation.
The man who does constabulary duty in
N. S. Wales is to get a well-earned but
insufficient rise, and when the plainest kind
of officer (the one who is doing his first five
years’ service) collects his enhanced emolu-
ment, he will be in receipt of 15s. 6d. a day.
The present rate for relief work at Darwin
is reported to be 19s. 3d. per day, the work
being the languid manufacture of a road on
which there are few people to walk. And
the imported Walsh is, in W.A., demanding
a new “log” for seamen—£6 IDs. for a 48-
liours week, and 4s. 9d. per hour overtime,
with 13 holidays per year on full pay.
THE WHITE MAN’S LAUNDRY.
[FOR THE BELLETIN.]
Said England unto Pharaoh: “I must make a man
of you
That will grow a lot of cotton in the heat,
That will cultivate the desert and improve the local
view
From Luxor to the place the camels meet.
I must give you seed and water and a market tor
your wares
And shepherd you most tenderly to school;
For I find it disconcerting to have everlasting scares
Near the ditch that brings me home my bread
and wool.
“You have very little honor, you have Very little
pluck,
And indeed you’ve very little left to eat;
But I lift the white man’s burden with a gentle
prayer to luck
That you’ll grow a lot of cotton in the heat.
You were dear to Cleopatra, Julius Caesar wished
you well ;
And the fact remains that still the Nile is wet.
So I’ll give you various lessons as to dodging shame
and Hell,
And we’ll make a kind of man out of you yet.”
At the pleasant word of England Pharaoh rose and
went to school—
Though he doubted much if that were Allah’s will—
He grew somewhat more a rascal, and a little less
a fool,
And the blackest of his dirt was with him still.
But he learned to trail a rifle in a somewhat slip-
shod way,
And he grew a lot of cotton in the heat;
And it seemed to distant watchers in some dim and
hazy day
He might stand up like a man upon his feet.
Alas for gentle visions through a glass that isn’t
straight!
Old Pharaoh stayed instinctively the same;
And as Africa and Asia both were sitting in his gate
And beating in his blood, he knew no shame.
He had grown a lot of cotton in the moisture and
the heat,
He had toiled through weary deserts making strife ;
But he held the firm conviction that the only way
to meet
His benefactors must be with a knife.
There are various plagues in Egypt, though che
cotton fields are wide;
But these words are written large on Pharaoh's
door:
“I give the younger nations every chance to come
inside,
But their habits and their follies I deplore.
I’ve had much the same assistance as your England
offered me
From Assyrians, Persians, Greeks and all the clan;
And every one, like lvipling, was at first prepared
to see
A piece of mud converted to a man.’’
Straining at the white man’s burden, nations totter
to and fro,
But the, job outlives the grandest show of zeal;
With tobacco, rice and cotton and some other things
to show,
Still the burden is too great to lift and wheel.
We take in the black man’s washing, full of energy
and hope,
And the laundry sings a most ecstatic song;
But at last we’re forced to realise the bitter waste
of soap,
For the dye of racial color runs too strong.

The National of N.Z. does a considerable
marine business, which of itself is enough to
explain why, after a very rapid growth of
premium income a few years ago, there has
been a steady shrinkage during the last few
years. The general rise in Maoriland values
has of course helped to put up premium
earnings; and the same movement has in-
creased the expenses. Expenses, however,
are winning in the race. If commodities and
property in general are worth 50 p.c. more
than they were a few years ago, and if it
costs 50 p.c. more to insure them, it is
reasonable enough that it should cost also
50 p.c. more to run the business of insuring
them. If it only did that the expense rate
would remain stationary; but actually it has
moved up several points—so many points, in
fact, that in the past year only about 1 i p.c.
of the premium income was profit. The
margin is so small as to be distinctly uncom-
fortable. It would be less uncomfortable if
one could be sure that the loss rate was
exceptional. That rate is certainly higher
than it has been, as a rule; but one has to
consider whether the moral hazard is not
greater than it. was. There unquestionably
has been a slackening in many respects. The
community is doing things and tolerating
things which it would have neither done nor
tolerated a few years ago. And it may be
that fire-insurance cos.’ loss rates are going
to suffer in consequence. Admittedly there
is no clear proof of it yet; but here and
there one gets a suggestion of it.
However, there is no reason whatever for
holders of this co.’s policies to have any
anxieties. Paid capital and reserves com-
bined are £701,325, so that more than
times last year’s heavy losses could be met
without further assistance from premiums.
Funds equal to 150 p.c. of the year’s pre-
miums are reckoned a fair thing: the
National has 350 p.c. And it has them for
the greater part in securities of the best and
most quickly available sort: —

to pay the dividend, but just enough to pay
10 p.c. on the capital with as much over as
would buy a haggis or two.

The disclosed profit goes up another step.
But that was necessary, for 146.355 more
shares have to be fed as from May last.
There is no certainty that the profits were
not greater. Henry Jones Co-op. is a hold-
ing co. It does not make jam; it merely
owns all or most of the shares of the cos.
which do. And what those cos. owe, are
owed, earn and have in reserve the report
sayeth not. But this holding co. has a very
capable Board, and has produced healthy
divs. regularly for a long time, and share-
holders let it go at that; Henry .Tones and
Ach. Palfreyman are on the bridge—or at
the boilers —and all’s right with their little
world. The co. had its start through these
two. They put life into the Tasmanian jam
business, won most of the trade in the Speck
and cast eyes on the mainland. The waste
in buying and selling, the overlapping and the
inefficiency offended their ideas of the fit-
ness of things. So H. J. Co-op. was formed.
It bought all or a controlling number of
shares in leading cos. in Hobart, Melbourne
and Sydney. Since those days there have
been other purchases and extensions overseas.
All form part of the uninformative item in
the balance-sheet: “Investments —at cost.
Shares and interests in jam-manufacturing
and fruit cos. and timber-mills in the Com-
monwealth of Australia, South Africa, Eng-
land and America,” £1,109,756. In 1910 it
stood a few score pounds under the half-
million. The co. is not a combine, for the
various businesses retain their identity. And
it is not a monopoly, for there are unasso-
ciated cos. all over the Commonwealth.
Exactly what it is does not particularly mat-
ter to the producer and the consumer so
long as each gets a fair deal. The co. stepped
in when there was waste in buying, waste in
manufacturing and waste in selling, and
reduced it to a minimum. Someone was
paying for, that waste. The co. has placed
production on a better basis, has sought and
won an export trade (an example which
other manufacturers might copy), and, on
balance, Australia owes it something. Never-
theless there is probably a limit to the profits
it would be allowed to make. It is handling
a necessary commodity, and therefore jeal-
ous eyes are turned towards it. Nobody
knows that better than the directors: hence
they separate the profits made respectively
at home and overseas. Of the £139,941 made
in the past 12 months £20.395 is credited to
overseas business, and 24 p.c. of the 13|
p.c. div. is a special distribution on that
account.
The outlook for the shares seems bright
enough, but that conclusion is come to by
reasoning backwards. Thus : Divs. have been
regular; therefore they should continue re-
gular. In support is the fact that the sub-
sidiary cos. have almost certainly grown
stronger with the years, because it is not
likely that the parent wmuld be given profits
which permit of accumulations to published
reserves unless provision had already been
made by the children. As for security, the
whole of the capital (£540,652) is repre-
sented by shares and interests, and there is
an additional £247,521 in reserves, mostly
invested in the same way. The sum of
£91,328 was the original amount set down
for goodwill, and there may have been more
in subsequent interests acquired. But it is
a tolerably safe guess that the position is
at least as good as stated. And the co. is
handling a commodity which is not subject
to the vagaries of fashion or (except to a
small extent) the influence of invention.
Since its formation in 1910 it has disclosed
£1.258.050 of profits and distributed
£1.017,722 to shareholders.

Tim co. had a smooth run in its early years;
10 p.c. divs. were regular and easily paid!
Then came the storms of the ’nineties. Most
of the capital was in mortgages, and when
the bottom dropped out of things the co. was
landed with many of the securities. Profits
disappeared for a while. Finally, by halting
steps, the rate crept up to 7 p.c.,' and the
progress, generally speaking, has been main-
tained. Meantime great changes have been
made in the contents of the co.’s stocking:

business is expanding it is impossible to
say. The value of trust estates adminis-
tered is not disclosed. Other figures suggest
that the rate of progress has been steady
but not so great as with some other trustee

to those who place their trusts in the co.’s
keeping is substantial enough. As for share-
holders, if the directors earned only a ridi-
culous 4 p.c. on total funds they could still
pay 10 p.c., and that is not allowing any-
thing at all for earnings from the business.

The News has tradition behind it—the tra-
dition which it won in its 40 years as Syd-
ney’s chief evening newspaper. But near
its 40tli birthday something or somebody
slipped, and the News sank while the Sun
rose. Three years ago Holdings, Ltd., a co.
representing Sydney’s chief retailers, bought
in. The subsequent' progress under manag-
ing-editor Knox is disclosed in the introduc-
tory table. Of last year's profit £11,767
was added to the plant replacement reserve
(it now stands at £31,485), the P. and L.
balance being £3429. The general reserve
is unchanged at £19,500. But portion of
the capital is represented by goodwill—to
what extent is not stated in the accounts,
which explains the “nominal” that qualifies
the last column. It is hidden in the untidy
entry “Plant, machinery, freehold property,
goodwill, establishment, etc.,” amounting, as
at Oct. 30, to £256,271. In the 1923 term
a Kent-street freehold was sold and the profit
of £3OOO placed to reserves. “Freeholds”
thereupon disappeared from the accounts.
This year the item appears again without
comment. The co. has not much longer to
stay in its present premises, the 50 years’
lease having only a couple of years to go.
A new building is proposed, and that will
call for a lot of money. New funds will
be needed for this, and there should not be
much difficulty in getting them ; for as long as
Holdings, Ltd. (in which are some of Syd-
ney’s greatest advertisers), are in the busi-
ness, divs. are almost a certainty, given, of
course, reasonably good direction. Balance-
sheet movements reflect the £50,000 addition
to capital from calls made during the past
year on 100,000 new shares. A further
£22,500 is yet to come from this source. The
composite “plant, machinery,” etc., item has
gone up over £69,000, doubtless through
additions to machinery and purchase of a
freehold. Stocks are £10,766 greater on
the year. Sundry creditors at £74,151 have
expanded by £16.475, probably again the in-
fluence of the property purchase. Against
that wore liquid and semi-liquid assets of
£1 OS 894, and there was, in addition, the
£256.271 representing plant, property and
goodwill.

And again reserves are drawn upon to pay
the modest div. This is the third time since
11)20, with the result that the total lay-by
is now £6382 less than it was then. What
is the matter? A year ago the chairman said
that stock values had been so well looked
after that the dividend could be safely put
up from 6 p.c. to 7 p.c. If it isn’t old over-
valuation of stock that is now causing
trouble, what is it? A concern of this sort
that can’t earn 7 p.c., notwithstanding that
it is carrying very considerable risks, is in
need of an overhaul somewhere. The posi-
tjon with regard to the before-mentioned
risks is as follows—

Certainly there isn't the overtrading there
was —four years ago liabilities actually ex-
ceeded the capital—but £62,779 is too much
money to owe. The first half-crown the
directors have to spare should be invested in
a pruning-knife.

Though the capital is not yet all represented
by assets that you could stub your toe
against in the dark, good progress is being
made in supplying the deficiency: the lay-by
in three years has been £15,226. In seven
years, if that progress is maintained, the
whole of the capital should be represented
by tangible assets. The outside liabilities
are not large (£55,725) ; in fact, they are
remarkably small considering that no less
than £93.160, or 55 p.c. of the capital, is in
land and buildings. Such figures are made
possible only by the very moderate size of
the book debts. Generally speaking, good
seasons such as those of 1923-24 greatly help
the profits of specialty houses such as this:
in droughty times the big wholesale houses
have to finance country and other clients,
who then can’t deal direct with the specialty
house. But the margin between profits and
the 10 p.c. in good years is wide enough to
suggest that a very fair dividend could be
made in much less favorable circumstances.

J-t the boom days the society’s shares were
£5 paid. After a long struggle half the capi-
tal was written off; now 30s. per share has
been restored, chiefly out of “profits” on
sales. This really means that values have
gradually crept back towards the old boom
levels. And if those properties are back in
the neighborhood of boom levels, then the
chances are that the properties upon which
the society is now making advances are also
in the neighborhood of what they would have
been in the boom days. Certainly conditions
are not the same as they were 30-odd years
ago; for one thing Melbourne has now a
much larger population, and, therefore, nor-
mal prices are higher than they used to be.
Nevertheless the reflection ought to make,
and probably is making, the directors of
such concerns very careful to see that there
are wide margins between valuations and
advances. In any case one thing is sure:
even if the property market collapsed, no-
thing like the disaster of the early ’nineties
could follow, because in these days the out-
side money in most of these businesses is
scarcely worth mentioning. This society’s
liabilities total only £24.530—1e5s than £1
for every £6 of the shareholders’ own funds.
This means that the directors wouldn’t have
to do much selling in a hurry, and'that is
the sort of selling which makes all the
trouble. But -while this small employment
of outside money reduces the risks of capi-
tal, it also puts the hobbles on profits; and

Oriomo, a syndicate in 10,000 shares of
£1 each, is being formed in Sydney to make
a survey of the country around the Oriomo
and Binaturi rivers in Papua. The license
covers 1000 square miles east of the Dutch
border and north of Daru. The plateau is
dotted with domes situated on the top of
ridges and anticlines somewhat similar to
the formation which led to the discovery of
the Texas oilfield. The country shows no
sign of undue folding and the dip of the
strata is not too steep. The expedition is
to be led by Captain S. N. McLean and H.
G. Foxall (geologist). The proposal is to
take a small plant capable of drilling to
750 ft. and, while a three to six months’
geological survey is the main intention, the
small plant might find the oil if it is at
shallow depths. The prospectus mentions
the rumor that oil is being shipped by the
Dutch from near their border. This rumor,
it says, is very persistent, but the promoters
have not been able to confirm it. Seepages
and oil scum prove that oil exists in the
area. Whether in payable quantifies will be
better known after the survey. Certainly the
indications are there, the formation is favor-
able, and the principals, whose qualifications
are vouched for by Professor David, accept
shares and venture forth to justify their
faith in the area.

Canadian ventures of Associated Gold
Mines (W.A.) still prosper. One, the
Vipond gold-mine, Ontario, made an esti-
mated profit for the first 10 months of this
year of 200,000 dollars, while another, the
Keeley silver bonanza, in the same province,
produced nearly 11 million ounces of silver
and is paying half-yearly divs. of 8 per cent,
and bonuses of 4 per cent.

Westralia’s latest spectacular gold find is
at Black Hills, about 35 miles along the
Transcontinental line from Kalgoorlie and
a short distance from Mt. Monger. A few
tons of rich stuff has been obtained on or
near the surface, and block holders are de-
manding high prices for what remains. Years
ago thousands of ounces of alluvial gold were
specked and dryblown in this locality, and
the wealth then got is alleged by option
sellers to have been shed from the reef just
uncovered.

A private co., Wiluna Development Syndi-
cate, was recently registered in London with
a nominal capital of £20,000 in £1 shares to
take over the option held by A. H. Collier
and the liquidating Ivanhoe Co. on the
Gwalia Consolidated .at Wiluna (W.A.). The
subscribers are clerks at No. 1 London Wall,
which is Collier’s office. The syndicate has
started sinking to confirm the attractive re-
sults obtained a few months ago by the bore.
If it is successful, a big flotation will be
attempted.

Lanarkshire Co. has taken an option on
the old Mt. Burgess (W.A.), where the find
recently _ mentioned on this page was made.
A deposit of £3OO has been paid, and if the
deal is completed shareholders will be asked
to find a further £3700. Lanarkshire is one
of the many weakly-financed no liability
mining concerns which belong to Adelaide,
and was hurriedly formed there at the be-
ginning of the Hampton Plains boom. It left
that field in disgust and took an option on
another Westralian show on the Broad Arrow
field. A call was then made on the strength
of good prospects, but as these proved a
myth it gave up.

Hampton Celebration’s reconstruction is
expected to be completed in London in about
a month, and with the proceeds from a new
share issue the directors propose to pay off
pressing accounts and make a fresh start.
The outlook for shareholders, however, is
not hopeful, as the chances of turning the
co.’s property at Hampton Plains to profit-
able account hang by the slenderest thread.

Big odds are offered against the Monte
Carlo Bank Co. getting anything worth hav-
me on the site of its present option at Cue.
Some months ago about £7OOO was taken
from a rich patch, and on the strength of
this, an option and a bag of specimens, a
small and short market flutter was engi-
neered. Years ago, when known as the Kan-
garoo Dog, the show produced a few hundred
ounces of gold; before that, when called the
Caledonian, it yielded about five times that
amount of wealth. But its rich patches are
too infrequent to support a co.
* * * *
. searc h gold in old mines continues
in Westralia. In the Little Wonder, beyond
Leonora, two old prospectors are looking
for a lost shoot which yielded thousands of
ounces in the early days, and in two other
places at the back of Meekatharra and
Wiluna parties of miners are doing well on
areas which long ago were abandoned when
the stone was not rich.
Lake Bunga Oil Well Co. (\ ic.) is mak-
ing a fresh appeal for capital to deepen the
present borehole. Vic. Mines Department
has advised the co. that it estimates the thick-
ness of the tertiary or sedimentary rocks
under the bore-site at 4000 ft. Lately tne
casing was raised from the stratum of sand-
stone in which the drill was working at
1200 ft., being lifted to 1061 ft., where oil and
gas were encountered on August 2 last.
Directly the top of the oil sand was un-
covered by the withdrawal of the six-inch
casing a burst of gas carried up mud, sand
and water, containing oil-films and globules.
An apparatus has been installed to catch
gas and sand for chemical examination.

Mt. Cobalt, Selwyn (N.Q.), is looking
well, and low-grade ore has been proved at
a depth of 210 ft., where a level has been
started. Production has enormously in-
creased the last year, and the mine is at pre-
sent producing on an average monthly about
100 tons of 20 p.c. cobalt concentrates. As
the crude ore assays 4 p.c. metal, this spells
a big tonnage. High-water figures thus far
were for July last: 167 tons of 17 p.c. cones,
containing 28.5 tons of metallic cobalt, value
£5708. The value works out at roughly £2
per unit, so the ’trates vary from £35 to
£4O a ton. The mine, which, by the way,
is apparently the only cobalt mine in the
world (Canada produces her metal as a by-
product of silver ores'), has a big future if
the market remains right. American com-
petition is, however, a thing to be feared.
* * * *
There is now no doubt that water-level
has been reached on the Mt. Isa field, as 1 it
has been struck in three different shafts
between 150 ft. and 190 ft., and the flow has
been heavy enough to suspend sinking. The
ore is making entirely into galena, now
carrying a trace of zinc for the first time,
an additional peg on which to hang the theory
that the primary ore has been reached. So
far there has been no noticeable silver en-
richment. Some of this primary has gone
over oOOoz. of silver, but at 200 ft. in the
Black Star No. 10 shaft the sulphides
assayed only 10oz. The lead values, how-
ever, are hanging out wonderfully well, and
30 p.c. lead was the assay for the full width
of the shaft. Ernest Bails is allowing
900,000 tons of payable ore for every 100 ft.
of sinking on the Isa Mines, Ltd., lodes. But
what is payable ore? Nobody yet seems to
have much idea. Probably Bails is talking
conservatively, and the future of the field as
a lead producer is as assured as anything can
be in mining, provided lead does not take to
the low-price track which copper has fol-
lowed so long.
* * * *
Mt. Isa Prop, has exercised its options
which were due in January, and the leases
now belong to the co. Final payment is to
be made by July 27 next. There will, of
course, have to be a new issue of shares.
Willie Robinson (Clark and Robinson) is
on the way from London with Corbould, who
has Mt. Isa’s affairs in hand. The present
idea is that a London crowd shall put up
£500,000 if the tests are satisfactory. There
is a great deal of money available in London;
but most of it is looking for more security
than new mining ventures offer.

It is 44 years since Dr. R. L. Jack first
examined the Bowen River Coalfield (Q.),
and four years since the State Colliery was
opened. At present the latter has a capa-
city of 400-500 tons daily. The Bowen Con-
solidated Coal Co. is also working. Geo-
logist J. H. Reid has lately made a fairly
exhaustive report on the coalfield and its
possibilities. His estimates of tonnages are
immense. In 400 sq. miles of coal measures
mapped there is likely to be 20.000 millions
of tons of coal, assuming that the aggregate
thickness of the seams so far as known does
not diminish. In the Collinsville portion of
the field (area 20 sq. miles) he considers
there are 420,000,000 tons of actual and
probable reserves, but of this only
110,000,000 tons are likely to see daylight,
as the carbonisation of the seams by intru-
sions of volcanic rocks is widespread and
serious. These figures indicate that, after
allowing for losses in mining, about 60 p.c.
of all coal underground has been destroyed
or reduced in efficiency, leaving 40 p.c. as
probably available for mining. But this
40 p.c. will keep the field going for some
generations ahead, even if a big export trade
is developed. Incidentally, the report con-
firms many of Dr. Jack’s old conclusions—•
as to the extensive “burning” of the coal-
seams, among other things.

Arthur Morry’s crowd is going to sink the
Woolston oil-bore, near Brisbane, a bit
deeper. Work was stooped below 800 ft. by
flooding and tool troubles. Everything is
cleared for a new start, and Morrv is con-
fident he will strike oil about 890 ft.. Gas
and oil were reported in traces, but E. O.
St. Smith’s report some time back gave the
impression that, while traces of oil were
present, they might have been films from
lubrication of the machinery emploved. Any-
way, a couple of months ahead should see
the bore down to 900 ft. and make or mar
Morry’s venture.
There is an accumulation of about 300
tons of arsenic at the State mine at Jibben-
bar (Q.), and on me sale of this the ques-
tion of the resumption of furnace operations
will depend. Last year the American market
was open, large supplies of the poison being
used on the boll-weevil in the cotton areas.

Randolph Bedford writes:—
Some more defence of State-owned coal-mines to
please my anonymous friend “Shareholder.” When
George Cann established a State coal-mine at Lith-
gow (N.S.W.), western coal was the price of New-
castle to the Railway Department, although inferior.
The mere threat of a State coal-mine dropped the
price 2s. a ton. The Labor Government started sin ic-
ing, and as soon as it was replaced by the “Gnashes”
the shaft was abandoned and the price went up
again. Labor returned to power, resumed sinking
and developed the coal, and further vested the mine
in the Railway Commissioners, so that an Act of
Parliament would be required for its second aban-
donment in the interests of the coal ring. Privately-
mined Western coal then dropped from 17s. lOd. to
15s. 10d., and now a million tens for railway use
are tendered at 11s. sd. In the face of these figures
anybody who will condemn State ownership of
collieries because there may be a slight bookkeeping
“loss” is too crazy for argument.
Consulting-engineer Joseph Campbell has
made a progress report on the Belimbla
Creek, at Nerrigundah, N.S.W. South Coast,
'inere are 90,000 contribs paid to 2s. and
00,u00 vendors paid to the full ss. Ten
tons crushed by the Government battery at
Nerrigundah returned lOoz. A 15-head bat-
tery on the leases nears completion; and, if
schedule time is observed, the stamps should
be dropping early in January. “So great is
the supply of ore,” says Campbell, “that 50
head of stamps can easily be kept constantly
going.” The tunnel to cut the main lode is
in 450 ft., or about half-way to its objective;
but, continues the optimistic report, “there
is plenty of good crushing ore available as
soon as the battery is ready.” Undoubtedly
there has been the spirit of hustle about the
snow, and Campbell testifies that “we are
proud of the work already accomplished, and
shall be prouder still when the stamps begin
to fall and the stream of gold begins to run
early in the New Year.” Redeeming features
are that no calls have been made; that the
last block of 15 000 shares has been taken
by original holders; and that no attempt has
been made to list the co. on ’Change or
otherwise create a premature boom in the
scrip.

C. R. Mackenzie appears to have given up
Vi my Ridge (N.S.W. ) for the time being.
He has issued a report on the prospects of
the Flagstone tin show at Corduroy Gully, 22
miles north of Emmaville, after spending two
days dollying and panning on the leases. He
concurs in the good opinions expressed by
E. P, Johnson and L. P. Collins, and an-
nounces that he is doubling his interest in
the float. Further, he recommends that
“work should be commenced with as little
delay as possible.” Certainly, with tin about
£260, the show would stand to benefit by a
little additional hustle.

Tingha Tin Co. (N.S.W.) treated 7700yds.
during November for 54 tons oxide, an aver-
age of 1.61 b. to the yard. The return shows
a profit of £4OO. There will be a hold-up for
10 days or a fortnight while ladder altera-
tions are affected and a new cutter installed.
Manager Grey Wilson now announces that
the principle of the suction cutter is 0.K.,
the difficulty having been with the cutter
itself. The new one being installed is of the
strongest steel procurable, and Wilson fore-
casts that the turnover of earth will be
trebled when it starts.

The odd halfpenny is good as showing the
vigilance of the accountant; but shareholders
generally would be much more interested to
know wliat the recovered gold was worth.
* * * *
Kamunting Tin (F.M.S.), having got its
fourth dredge in commission, made a record
recovery of 126 tons oxide for November. The
co. is the only one in its locality hampered
by the red-tape and circumlocution usually
associated with mining administration from
London. Despite this, the market values the
300.000 £1 shares at 50s. nowadays. They
hung a long while in the neighborhood of 385.,
but increasing returns and a steady metal
market have given the stock the lift which
had been long delayed.

Another Australian-owned tin dredging co.
making heavy weather of it is Bundi, in
80.000 20s. shares. These were taken to
435. 6d. before dredging commenced. The
premium has been rudely discounted . since
the plant began to speak. Some 21,000yds.
a fortnight are being treated for 10 tons
oxide. At first the low yardage was attributed
to the fact that opening out at the head of
the valley necessitated the negotiation of
shallow ground. This explanation is now
supplemented by a statement that buried tim-
ber has been met in such quantity that the
dredge buckets cannot be filled; and three
months hence is the amended date when “con-
ditions will improve as the dredge works
into deeper and unencumbered ground.”
Share values have receded to 365. 6d.
S.A. Oil Wells Co., the pioneer in the
modern search for petroleum in Australia, is
t s a °f a recent development.
11. S. Lyne, an Australian geologist with
American experience, has had another look
at the co.’s bore-hole at Caroline (S.A.),
not far from the Glenelg River and close
to the Victorian border. Recently gas threw
mud and water 200 ft. in the air. During the
excitement somebody dropped a few heavy
tools down the casing, possibly to try to
keep the mucky stuff in its place. A fishin"
job recovered the tools, and the water was
almost shut off. The hole is being bailed
ot its water, which comes from above 760 ft.
Dyne expects when this work has been done
that there will be a showing of oil and gas.
He says there are 200 ft. of oil and gas sands
cla y s < and the drill at
104 oft. is still m these sands. This is not
very much, but it is the best showing the
co. lias had in its nine years’ struggle.

“Depositor”: Australian banks in their
competition for business have dotted the
sparse suburbs with “one-man” branches. One
of these furnished the setting for the Hamp-
ton (Melbourne) tragedy, the young officer m
charge being mortally wounded whilst defend-
ing the bank’s property. A previous crime was
the shooting of Berriman, also of the C.8.A.;
and between the two there have been at least
three hold-ups of lonely officers. The one-
man bank —it is commoner in Melbourne
than elsewhere —is a standing invitation to
the criminals who are keeping the police
working overtime, and officials are beginning
to regard an appointment to any of these
places with mixed feelings; yet they know
that if they seek advancement they cannot
be choosers. Public opinion in Melbourne,
however, is becoming insistent that the banks
are showing too slight a regard for the risks
to which they are exposing their officers.

“Claude de Tropic”: In October, 1915, my
mate Bluey stopped a sniper's bullet at
Anzac while carrying water up Monash
Gully. He finished up at the 19th General
Hospital in Alexandria, where he was nursed
by a little English girl, who told him she
had an uncle somewhere in Queensland.
When he rejoined his unit at Ismailia, four
months later, he confided to me that he would
have proposed to the nurse if he had thought
she would have accepted him. “Of course,
a rough bloke like me wouldn’t have a hope
with a little woman like that.” said Bluey
sadly. Back in Queensland Bluey worked
in sugar districts, and last June he cashed
his gratuity bond. This added to wdiat he
had saved provided him with sufficient cash
to purchase a farm near Ayr. The second
day after he had taken possession he went
across to introduce himself to the owmer of
the adjoining farm. In response to his
knock a woman came to the door —the little
girl who had nursed him in Alexandria. Her
uncle was Bluey’s neighbor, and the girl
had arrived in Queensland last year. Any
need to go on?
“Metabol”: “Sex persistency” might be
the term applied to the case told me by an
old naturalised Hol-
lander. “Mein frau,”
he said, “vos un Eeng-

“Bouragi”: The visits of Indian “poten-
tates” to Europe have always been a source
of anxiety to the Indian Government, and
the recent adventures of “Mr. A” will just
about put the lid on. Even Ranji, the
cricketer, got a gentle reminder that there
was work to do at home, and, after the latest
blackmail-conspiracy scandal, it is not hard
to picture liajahdom confined to barracks
for some time to come. The feature of
the case which rouses the attention of the
amateur in these matters is the precise fix
in which the potentate of Kashmir found
himself when his room was invaded. It is
hard to believe that he could have been
stampeded into such tremendous payments
by a threat of a mere action for adultery,
reprehensible as that may seem to anyone
not yet discovered in like case. “Mr. A’s”
counsel said the money was extorted by “the

most terrible of menaces.” Taken in conjunc-
tion with the written evidence of a dis-
tinguished Indian ethnologist. Sir Havelock
Charles, and that of a woman doctor with
many years’ practice among Indian women,
that statement carries its own significance.
The sickening part of the whole beastly thing
is that the decoy-duck in the unsavory
episode will go scathless.

“Chhota Peg”: There is at least one race,
apparently, with an infallible test for sanity.
Rebecca had been for some time in one of
Vic.’s homes for the deluded, and her mother
called on the medical superintendent to ask
how soon the child could be liberated.
“Rebecca is perfectly normal.” she claimed.
“When I went to see her I took the money
out of my purse and she counted it quite
correctly.”

“Xmaile”: Probably it was the Bowser
outside that inspired it. He gave a great
exhibition of sozzled pedestrianism as he

you put a—hch —gallon’r petrol into me—

“Toby C.”: Re postal efficiency. A young
Dane who had followed railway construction
work up north fell on hard times in War-
wick (Q.), and asked me to write a few
appeals for assistance to some of his north-
ern pals. He was particularly confident
about a favorable response from “Dick,” a
former tent mate. Having stressed the
urgency of Hans’s needs to this likely bene-
factor, I asked, “Now, what is Dick’s sur-
name?” “I only been know him as ‘Dick
the Turk,’ ” replied Ilaus. For lack of any-
thing more definite the letter sped on its
way addressed to “Dick the Turk, Casey’s
Gang, Construction Works, Ingham, N.Q. ’
Inside two weeks the Turk’s p. 0.0. duly
came to hand. Hans had even forgotten the
ganger’s name, and, as they were all strangers
to me, I just risked “Casey.”

“Der Jong”: Jewry’s objection to the
Oxford Dictionary’s subsidiary meaning of
“Jew” as “an unscrupulous usurer” (B.
27/11/’24) is, of course, natural; still, most
races have to stand the same racket, and
sometimes there is local opprobrium as well
as general. When I first knew the Trans-
vaal and the Orange Free State every span
of oxen held one, generally the stupidest
and most useless brute, whose name was
“Englischma-an,” and who was rarely ad-
dressed save with whip cracks. Similarly
in Natal a florin was colloquially known as
a “Scotchman,” because a contractor with
a Mac in front of his name was said to have
once paid off his Kaffir laborers with eight
of such coins to the pound, the guileless
heathen accepting them for half-crowns. A
Natal Kaffir to this day will not accept a
florin, and he goes warily if he hears there
is a Caledonian about.
“Nikko”: “Riverina’s” remarks, on the
seas round the Bluff and Stewart Island
(M.L.) recall some lively joilrneys between
the two places. Even a “good” passage is
a thrilling experience; in moderate weather
the passengers are all kept below, and in
time of storm the boats keep in port. The
start is made from
the Bluff, where it
is invariably rain-
ing, and the pas-
senger is solemnly
given his choice of
up or down; the
reckless spirits
who choose the
former are duly
placed on the high-
est portion of the
small timber boat
and roped securely
to the seats. Then
the fun begins.
The craft lurches,
rocks, rolls, rides
dizzily up green
hills, crashes into
wave-troughs, buries
herself in foam and
spray, groans, shiv-
ers, wallows —in
short, does every-
thing but capsize.
The unfortunates
aloft make prayer
to Providence, the
captain or even the
stray seamen cling-
ing precariously to
the bulwarks, but
nobody heeds their
dire distress —once

goes on for two

“FY7”: There seems to be a slackening in
the Caledonian fibre. The other day a cable
announced that the sacred name of haggis
was to be omitted from the menu of the
Scottish dinner at the Savoy (London) on
St. Andrew's night, because of Southron
ribaldry. The chieftain of the pudding race
is to be served at the dinner, “but unobtru-
sively”—as if a haggis were a daisy. It has
always puzzled me why the Caledonians stern
and wild don’t retaliate for gibes at haggis
with some scathing references to black pud-
dings, stuffed ox-heart and other abominable
dishes beloved of the Englishman. I still
have a menu of a Hallowe’en dinner held in
Townsville years ago which scorned such
pitiful surrender as that implied in the omis-
sion of the name of the national dish. Few
of the Southrons present were able to trans-

late the menu out of Scots before the toast
list rendered them incapable of translating
anything. It began with “Partan’s taes,”
went on through “Biled tup’s heid an’ taties”
and culminated in the haggis. I remember I
had to pass the haggis, owing to the “tup’s
heid” having been insufficiently singed before
cooking.

“FY7” : A dreamy sort of bandit material-
ised at Ipswich (Q.) the other day. It was
pay-day in the foundry and the clerks were
busy with £7OO or so when the I'obhei'
arrived. He was masked and presented the
usual revolver, but so unconvincingly that
when he demanded the money the man who
was looking after it asked how much of it
he would like. The intruder wasn t certain,
but thought a couple of quid would do. After
that had been handed to him he ,seems to have
reconsidered the matter and mildly suggested
that 20 would be a fair thing. His demand
having been complied with he considerately
withdrew. Ipswich always had the reputa-
tion of being the tiredest town in Queens-
land, and even its bushrangers seem to suffer
from the prevailing listlessness.

“B V E.” • Another queer accident —in the
firing-line this time. On Gallipoli, just after
the Majestic was torpedoed, a six-inch how-
itzer was planted in
Shrapnel Gully. It
was manned by a
gun crew from the
survivors of the
Majestic, with an
18-year-old Aussie
lad of the sth Aus.
Artillery as gun-
layer. Word came
through from the
observers to elevate
the gun to a cer-
tain degree and
then to stand by in
readiness to fire.
After loading, the
crew were raising
the gun witli the
man on the lanyard
at the ready, when
a warning drone
caused them all to
duck and a ten-
pounder from
Jacko came along.
That shot struck
the lanyard fair
and square, and
buried itself harm-
lessly in the dirt
without exploding.
But the howitzer
roared and recoiled,
badly crippling two
of the crew and
laying out the gun-
layer. The sequel
was curious. The
observers ’phoned
down that the acci-
dental shot had
scored a direct hit on a moving body of
Turks, and forgot to report the crew for
firing without the word.

“Centurion” : Civilisation is becoming more
and more of a nark. A badly-wanted U.S.
citizen, who had departed to Canada with
a million dollar's or so of embezzled money,
was grabbed by the sleuths the other day
because he had been foolish enough to send
to the presser’s a coat beneath the collar
of which a particularly thorough tailor had
written his customer's name. Laundry
marks are equally dangerous. Not long ago
one of these on a torn handkerchief con-
victed a Sydney woman of a serious crime.
Names or even initials are not necessary;
the private mark of the easily-traced
laundry makes the identification of the owner
of the suspicious article almost a certainty.
Time was when one could avoid danger of
this sort by going without clothes, or, at
least, without washing them, but those good
days are gone.

beating razors, table-knives and the like (84)
by a bare neck. There were 75 drowning
cases. This exhausts the really popular
methods. Only 14 went out by gas, 13
precipitated themselves from high places,
12 selected the hardest form of Juggernaut
offering. One Victorian felo de sc showed
a certain impartiality as well as thorough-
ness: he took poison and then shot himself
as he jumped over a cliff into the sea. Alto-
gether 492 men (including 3 boys under 15)
and 107 women committed suicide in 1923.

“Sixenate”: In a little neighbors’ row
ventilated in a Melbourne court it was
established that a woman named Bright was
also early. She was in the habit of getting
up before dawn; and when the neighbors
objected to the noise she made over her
domestic duties she hotly declared that the
woman (inferentially her neighbor) who
wanted to loaf in bed after sun-up was
“indecent.”
A virtuous lady named Bright
Held views so excessively right
That she dressed in the dark
Ere the rise of the lark
For fear she'd be seen by the light.

“Iford”: Since the Irish Free State got
into its stride, even staid English reference-
books have become more informative on the
subject of certain titles, or prefixes to sur-
names, which a few heads of families in the
Green Isle wear by traditional right. Mostly
the ennoblement, or whatever it can be
called, consists of being a “The” instead of
a “Mr.” Many people knew that “The
Knight of Kerry” and “The Knight of Glin”
were recognised Irish dignities, but I doubt
if many Sassenachs were aware that out of
thousands of Foxes only one individual is
empowered to call himself “The Fox” (Fox,
by the way, seems to be spelled O’Sionnach
in Erse). Some of the “Thes” have their
territorial spheres indicated, one observes,
just as an English nobleman might have; for
instance, there is “The McGillicuddy of the
Reeks” (a fuller-flavored title than anything
in the British peerage), and “The
O’Donogliue of the Glens,” which appeals
to one’s romantic sense, and “The O’Grady
of Killyballyowen,” which is a mellifluous
mouthful of dignity. Others style themselves
“Chief” by way of sub-title, and one even
claims to be a Prince of something or other.
There is another Irish departure from Eng-
lish usage which has always puzzled me, bur
I can’t glean anything about it from the
year-books. It concerns the use of “ff” in-
stead of the capital “F” as the opening letter
of certain family names. No Englishman
or Scot begins his name with anything but
a capital letter, but I am told there are Irish
families who treasure the right to open with
“if” or “11” as something above rubies. ,

“Percy Pawnticket”: An unpleasant
variety of husband was introduced to a Mel-
bourne bench the other day by a wife in
quest of maintenance. He never exactly
threatened her life, she explained ; but in his
darker moments he would withdraw to a
corner of the room and obtrusively count the
bullets in his revolver. There were two for
a brace of friends sufficiently valued to be
included in the inferred approaching tra-
gedy, one for his wife, two for their child-
ren and one for himself. The lady never
got quite used to the grim ritual, and finally
she left his roof; and the magistrate believed
be would have done as much himself. About
the same time another Court had to deal
with the application of a boarding-house
keeper to compel a contumacious boarder to
vacate his room. Her objection to his pres-
ence in the house arose from his habit of
quarrelling continually with other inmates
of the establishment; after every rumpus
he would retire to his room to sharpen his
razor whilst he speculated in loud tones —•
with the door open—upon the probable
toughness of the throats of those who had
offended him. The defence was that the
morbid person didn’t really possess a razor,
and he didn’t see any harm in making a noise
with a comb and a leather belt in order to
scare his enemies; but the decision was that
he would have to find new diggings.
One reason why the Christmas Bulletin
will be rushed when it is published next
Saturday (Dec. 13) is that it contains
perhaps tne last piece of verse Henry Law-
son penned—it was brought to the office a
few days before his death. It tells of the
mateship between three old gold-diggers, a
frenchman, a German and one who “might
have been Finn or Swede.” The verse pul-
sates with emotion, and beneath its rugged-
ness there is an intensity that will make the
characters a trio you will want to meet. In
addition to Lawson there are, of course, 50
or more writers, versifiers and artists—Steeie
Rudd, .Tames Edmond, Brady, Bedford,
Edward Dyson, Abbott, Percival, Souter and
Glover, to mention only a few whose efforts
, make the Christmas Number the “Year’s
Best.” It will be published at the same
price as an ordinary issue—sixpence.
MODERN CHIVALRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The old man in his easy-chair
Sat smoking, deep in thought,
And gazed upon his daughter fair
As cheerfully she wrought
To set the untidy house to rights—
A thing she’d done for many nights.
“I do wish Mum would stop at home
And help sometimes!” she cried.
“Just look—if visitors should come
They’d have to stay outside!”
The old man sighed, and shook his head.
“You mustn’t blame your Ma!’ he said.
“But, Dad, she’s nearly sixty now,
And ought to have more sense!”
A frown formed on the old man’s brow ;
His lips grew grim and tense.
“I know,” he said ; “but, all the same,
Your Ma is not so much to blame.”
“But, Dad,” his daughter said with heat,
“Mum’s jazzing in short skirts
Down at the hall in Melbourne-street,
While I work —that’s what hurts!”
“No matter, girl, how short her dress;
She is your mother, nevertheless!”
“Well, what’s she want to paint her lips .
And powder up her face,
And pad her bosom and her hips,
To go to that gay place?”
Again the quiet answer came:
“She is your mother, just the same!”
“I’ve got no patience with you, Dad!”
His angry daughter cried ;
“You’d drive a perfect angel mad—
You always take Ma’s side!
Although I don’t suppose you care,
This afternoon Mum bobbed her hair!”
“What?” cried the old man, pale and wan,
As totteringly he rose ;
“What has she been and gone and done?
Bobbed 1 What ? In them short clo’es ! ”
Yet still he murmured (he was game),
“She is your mother just the same! ”
And then he rallied. “Girl!” he said,
“Though you ai ; twenty-eight
And do not smea ■ your lips with red,
Or jazz, or stop out late,
She is .your mother, I declare,
No matter how she bobs her hair!”

Archbishop John Polding is probably the
only Australian prelate who has acted
as a powder-monkey. This was the job
assigned to him on his first trip to N. S.
Wales in the old East Indiaman Oriental,
which entered the Australian trade in 1835.
GEORGE ROBERTSON, of Angus and
Robertson, the Sydney publishers.
Pirates were always likely to be met with
on the long thrash to the Antipodes, so the
Oriental had mounted four guns, and the
principal passengers were given places on the
roster, whose heading was “Victory or
Death.” Polding was placed in the cockpit
along with the ship's doctor, Saunderson.
However, the Jolly Roger was never sighted ;
and four months later the Oriental dropped
her hook in Port Jackson without casualties.
Before Prendergast could formally take
command of the Opposition in Vic. Assembly
a meeting of Oppositionists (Laborites and
Jimmy McLachlan) was called. McLachlan
stayed away, and Prendergast w T as chosen.
The time for a change will not arrive till
next year. The first tussle will be for the
deputy-leadership when J. W. Billson, who
is ill, relinquishes the job.
Donald Mackinnon. the just-returned High
Commissioner in the U.S.A., is being tempted
into Federal politics. Corio is already after
him.
Sir William Grey Ellison-Macartney, who
was Gov. of the Speck from 1913 till 1917,
and of Westralia for the three subsequent
years—before that he was M.P. for South
Antrim and Deputy-Master of the Royal
Mint—is dead in Britain at 72. His widow
was a sister of Scott, the Antarctic explorer,
who died heroically near the South Pole. In
Tasmania Ellison-Macartney got into one of
those constitutional shindies which periodi-
cally disturb the island, and was in conse-
quence a bit unpopular; but Westralia found
a lot to admire in the tall, dry man from Dub-
lin, especially as he could make an excellent
speech. In Perth he lost an elder daughter,
a beautiful girl, who was picked up dying
after a fall from her horse, and the tragedy
undoubtedly shortened the father’s life,
although he never wore his heart on his
sleeve.
Adelaide’s best-known caricaturist, J. H.
Chinner, uses his pencil as a hobby. Insur-
ance is his business, and for over 30 years
he lias been manager of the Atlas Assurance
Co. He is now retiring with a life pension and
a seat on the local Board of Directors. Chin-
ner’s work has appeared in The Bulletin,
and nowadays he
does “notable citi-
zens” for the Jour-
nal. For many
years he has been
one of the best
bowlers in the
State, and has
rolled ’em up for
the Sturt Club —
its clubhouse is an
art gallery of mem-
bers who have been
pinned down on
paper by “J.H.C.”
H. F. RICHARD-
SON, new Vic.
Minister for
Forests, and leader
of the Upper House.
Captain Alexander Hambelton, C.8.E.,
R.D. and lots besides, had never seen Maori-
land, but he had heard Maorilanders on many
ocean liners he had skippered boosting God's
own (and Mr. Massey’s) country; and when
he dropped the wheel of the great White
Star Olympic, it was to M.L. he went for
a berth on shore. Auckland, with its fine
launching facilities, is his selection, and he
may emulate Jellicoe and his tiny Iron Duke
by cruising round in a little Olympic.
“Bouragi”: A London cable says that
Owen Cox, Arthur Rickard and Scott Fell
have been elected Fellows of the Royal Geo-
graphical Society. The activities of one of
this Sydney triumvirate in opening the wilds
of outer suburbia to civilisation have no
doubt earned him recognition, but what
claims the other two have to be included in
a society which took its time in recognising
such as Burton, Macgregor and Harry
Johnston It is difficult to imagine.
The passing of ex-Senator David Watson,
at 54, has made a gap in N. S. Wales Labor
and Prohibition ranks. He first came into
notice years ago when he moved to Sydney
from Newcastle to become chief of the field
staff of the N.S.W. Alliance. Later he suc-
ceeded Peter Bowling as President of the
Northern District Miners’ Union, and occu-
pied the position until 1914. It was during
liis reign that the afternoon shift for North-
ern colliery workers was abolished —the
miners contributed 10 per cent, of their
earnings for the best part of a year towards
that end. In the 1914 elections that followed
the double dissolution he beat Charlie Oakes
for the sixth place in the Senate by 4000
votes, and was one of the four Labor men
returned. But he could not hold the seat
in 1917, and also failed as a candidate for
the Newcastle five-member constituency at
the N.S.W. State election in 1922.
“C. Coral”: Harry Rowan, superinten-
dent of the recently-established Anglican Mis-
sion on the east coast of Cane York Penin-
sula. has already made a difference in that
locality. Jap. divers who found the east
coast a good recruiting-ground for “boys.”
and sometimes forgot to sign them on accord-
ing to law, have discovered suddenly that
such labor is now unsuitable for their pur-
poses. Rowan is Protector and J.P., and
carries a square jaw and 6ft. of muscular
manhood; which may have something to do
with it. The natives are now beginning to
come into the location on their own initia-
tive, and so there is no fear of police “drives.”
such as a Bulletin correspondent spoke
of some time back. Incidentally, some
Japanese half-caste blood is amongst the
mission’s “foundation members.”
Dr. F. W. Richards, K.C., is likely to
have a seat on the S. Aus. Supreme Court
Bench while Chief Justice Murray is away
next year. Like former Chief Justice Way,
he is a Methodist, and his hobbies are local
preaching and Sunday-school work in the
west end of Adelaide. A. ,T. Hannan, Parlia-
mentary Draftsman, will probably carry on
Richards’s work as Crown Solicitor.
Chandler, Vic. M.L.C., has been given his
first chance —he has been made a member of
the Railway Standing Committee, the fees
from which tot up to £240 a year to go with
his £2OO as member for the South-Eastern
Province. The Railway Committee is a train-
ing ground for Cabinets. Nearly every
Premier steals at least one member from
that body to make up his team.
Dr. W. T. Hayward having retired from
the Council of Adelaide Uni. after 24 years’
service, and five members having to take the
usual chance of re-election, there was a
brisk contest when the Senate met. (In
Adelaide the Senate is the whole body of
graduates of over three years’ standing, and
elects a council of 20, to which the Leg.
Council adds two and the Assembly three.)
Two new men headed the poll—Tom Barr
Smith, pastoralist and finance expert, and
Prof. Darnley Naylor, who has held the
Chair of Classics since 3900. The old mem-
bers were all returned, including Dr. Helen
Mayo, the only woman on the Council. An
old doctor and a young Anglican clergyman
were beaten. The Uni. was much under
parsonical influence in the early days, and
the original Act thought it necessary to put
in an odd clause that not more than four
ministers of religion shall be on the Council
at one time; but for years now there has
not been one at all, except Bickersteth (and
headmaster Girdlestone before him), repre-
senting education rather than the Church.
Colonel R. J. Collins, gone west in Maori-
land, was for many years the king-pin of
the National Rifle Association. He knew
all that was worth knowing about rifle shoot-
ing, and was himself in earlier days a cham-
pion shot. He commanded the team that
won the first Kolapore Cup for the Shaky
Isles. As a side-line in his 56 years of
Government service, mostly with the Trea-
sury, he sat on the Council for Defence and
the War Pensions Board.
Few men knew more about the Speck’s
north-eastern coalfield than Dan Brough, who
finished last week in Launceston at 77. He
picked up his ground-work in Durham
(Eng.), where he advanced to underground
manager before deciding to try his luck in
Australia. After a few years with the
A. A. Co. at Newcastle he went to the Speck
in ’BO, and helped to make holes in the
Beaconsfield goldfield. Later he drove the
first tunnel in the Cornwall colliery in the
St. Mary’s district, and ended up as man-
ager, until failing health caused him to sit
back in 1914.
The remnant of the old “Victorian Eleven”
still in the Assembly and some former Min-
isterial colleagues had Donald Mackinnon,
ex-envoy to U.S., at lunch at the State House
the other day. Twenty years ago Peacock
relinquished the Opposition leadership to
Mackinnon. who went to the country as head
of the “all-wool” Libs. He returned with
11. all told. Prendergast, aided by Anstey,
bluffed him out of the Opposition leadership
by pegging out seats on the two front
benches, and Mackinnon led his handful into
the Opposition corner. It was Tom Bent who
dubbed them the Victorian Eleven. The
name was not unpalatable to Mackinnon,
who is a godfather of Cabbage Garden
cricket. Three years later (1907) Bent
absorbed the eleven, but the alliance was a
failure. Had Mackinnon kept his party to-
gether as a separate entity he might have be-
come Premier. The most he attained was
the Attorney-Generalship under Watt and
Peacock (1913-15).
Dave Oman, Hampden’s choice, who is
threatening to bomb the Hayseed-Liberal
Coalition out of existence in Victoria because
Uppali House Conservative-Liberals are not
to be given immunity from Cocky attack in
June. 1925, is one of the wealthiest men in
the Chamber. He and one or two brothers have
made heaps of coin out of wool, and some
out of wheat, in the middle-west of the State.
After spending six years in the Bowser and
first Lawson Ministries Oman went out to
make room for the Lawson-Allan Coalition,
but returned after six months’ exile, and had
another spell of four months under Lawson
and Peacock up till July last. Chagrin at
non-inclusion in the present Ministry and
annoyance at the proposed appointment of
a Royal Commission on soldier settlement
probably have as much to do with his hos-
tility as the “insult” to doddery Liberalism.
“Notfarg”: Federal Treasurer Page was
boomed largely when the electric light was
being switched on at Grafton (N.S.YV.)
the other day, and even htfiled as the
“father” of the scheme. He isn’t; the honor
belongs to W. J. Mulligan, a mining engineer
residing in the locality, who advocated the
potentialities of the Nymboida River for the
generation of electricity while Page was still
practising in his native town, and long before
the latter floated into the House of Reps.
Now that John Verran and Dicky Butler
have passed from the South Australian
House of Assembly it is a dull place, but
occasionally Bert Edwards, the Labor mem-
ber, manages to liven things a little. G. R.
Laffer, one of the big guns of the Liberal
Opposition, was speaking on tree-planting,
and to indicate how he loved trees he men-
tioned the Adelaide Botanic Gardens and
“BERT"
EDWARDS, M.P.
and City Council-
lor, of Adelaide.
their beauties. The
Botanic Hotel is
opposite the Gar-
de n s on North-
terrace, and, like a
good many other
members, Laffer
has lodged there
during the session.
“When I was at
the Botanic Hotel,”
he confided, “I
spent every”
“Bob!” interjected
Edwards, who
knows what hotels
are—he owns the
Newmarket further
along the Terrace.
“Stellsby” : Tell “Intonsus” (B. 4/12/’24)
that Asquith didn’t grow whiskers when lie
was Premier. What’s more, lie doesn’t grow
’em now. So Baldwin isn’t the first British
Prime Minister (barring Rosebery) who lias
shown a hairless face to the world within
the last 70 years.
Ex-Attorneys-General Robinson and Slater,
of Victoria, got to raw personalities last week
on the question of the release of prisoners
while they were law Ministers. Robinson
managed to work in the word “cowardice,”
and Digger Slater seized on it to twit Robin-
son with letting two wars pass while he was
of military age without interfering. Peacock
and Eggleston rushed to the rescue of Robin-
son by explaining that lie had been rejected
because he is stone deaf in one ear.
Monsignor Mahoney, of Onehunga, the first
Maoriland-born priest, has just gained a
unique distinction. He has been raised to
the rank of Prothonotary Apostolic, the first
in M.L., which entitles him, among other
tilings, to wear a jewelled ring and white or
plain gold millinery.
Mrs. Sarah Sturt Taylor, who had an
84tli birthday-party the other day at North
Unley (Adelaide), is a cousin of explorer
Captain Sturt, and did some pioneering on
her own account —she travelled from Adel-
aide to Port Adelaide in the first train that
ran in S. Australia.
R. Barr, of Magill, near Adelaide, is the
great-grandfather of 125 children. With 14
children of liis own the veteran got a fair
kick off. He arrived from Scotland half a
century ago, and has just celebrated his
92nd birthday. He fought at
Balaclava (S.A.), had better times on Kan-
garoo Island, and during the war knitted
socks for soldiers.
“Ming” : The recent flash of the limelight
upon Allenby recalls to me the two hours
in Cairo when I posed as that august person-
age, or, at least, as part of him. Artist
Tennyson Cole, who had just completed a
successful portrait of the King, arrived in
Egypt commissioned to paint pictures of the
Sultan and Allenby. The Field-Marshal
gave sittings until the face was satisfactory,
and I happened along at the studio at the
moment Tennyson Cole was looking for a
commanding presence to fill the uniform. For
three awful hours I sat upon the dais gazing
into space, while the alarming array of
Allenby decorations was copied with meticu-
lous care. Even then the artist had not
finished, and suggested an appointment next
day, but I remembered an important engage-
ment and deputed a hefty private to try the
fun of being a Field-Marshal in the process
of being copied on canvas.
Not satisfied with having given 39 years
of service to the Speck’s railways, G. E.
Harrison selected one of his department’s
carriages for his deathbed last week. He
had risen to senior in the audit office when
his heart failed him while he was on his
regular trip from Claremont to his office.
William Clioat, a Crimean veteran, who
passed out at Christchurch (M.L.) the other
day, aged 91, was in Captain Barker’s bat-
tery which covered the Allies’ right flank
during the Charge of the Light Brigade.
Later he fell into the gentle hands of Flor-
ence Nightingale when he was wounded at
the Battle of Inkerman.
HURROO!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The steamer Knockfierna, registered at Limerick
and due in Sydney this week, will be the first vessel
to enter the harbor under the flag of the Irish Free
State. Her crew of 33 includes Americans, Danes,
Dutchmen, Russians, Lascars and a negro. The only
Irishman is the chief officer.” —S. M. Herald.
V e hoisted the harp without the crown, a pennant
in green and gold,
And sailed away from Limerick town, like Maceldunc
of old.
Again it waved on the Seven Seas, at the fore it
fluttered anew,
It rose and fell to the lilting breeze, the flag that
our fathers flew.
In the pride of a nation born again through Sydney
Heads we burst,
Squarehead and Lascar and Russ and Dane, with a
dinkum Celt for “first.”
Dutchies and Fritzes and Finns with cauls, and
some down-east Yanks to boot,
What should we care though in Tara’s halls “the
harp that once” is mute?
We have sailed again o’er the ocean ways with the
Hag at the peak aflame
That our forebears flew in the ancient days ere the
Norman spoilers came;
The flag that the Viking corsairs knew once more on
the waters rides—
With a Swede or two in the trusty crew and a
rollicking nig. besides.
Faith, didn’t old Neptune stare and blink the day
that we crossed the Line,
And reckoned ’twas worth an extra drink, that sight
for his bleary eync—
The flag that never its message told from wind-tossed
spar or sprit
Since Malachi wfere his collar of gold and Brian Boru
was It!
We carried it over the waters wide, for all that the
bunting’s worth,
With an Irish mate from the Shannon side and a
crew from the ends of earth.
We sailed away with a patriot roar from many a
Limerick throat
As the good old flag shot up once more o’er our
gallant craft to float.
There were double rations of grog that night, when
Erin’s coast-line sank,
For Dane and Dutchy and Muscovite, Lascar and nig.
and Yank ;
And we’re heaving her to with a “Crom a Boo”
from the inmost lungs of us,
Hollander, Finn and coolie, too, nigger and Yank and
Russ.

“Toby C.”: I’m not going to dispute the
weight or cash value of “Nitric’s” 1501 b. cod (15.
6/11/’24). I know there are still a few good fish : n
Booboora Lagoon and other waterholes in south-west
Queensland. A few months prior to “Nitric’s”
haul, two chaps spent an hour angling in the same
waterhole, and swapped their morning’s catch for
a fifth-hand Ford ear. Some weeks later the new
owners of the car traded it to me in exchange for
a bundle of rabbitskins. I lost men?}' on the
transaction, as skins rose tuppence a pound the
following day.
* * * *
“Nitric”: “Strack’s” method for removing
the bullet from his .22 is unique, and I’ll bet he
couldn’t score a maggie with it afterwards. Even
though lead has a low melting-point, the amount
of heat furnished by the coals on which “Strack”
placed the barrel would spoil the rifling of the bore.
Even the tempered steel of the barrel itself would
suffer in texture by the reheating “Strack” sub-
jected his blunderbuss to. He is correct in trying to
remove the leading of the barrel, for it is this that
causes the bullet to jamb; but there’s nothing better
for that than (1) acetic acid (dilute), (2) urine—
and in the trenches there was no acetic acid.
* * * *
“1.Tj.1.” : I saw a successful Too hunt
up Cape York Peninsula lately. A
gin came running into camp with
news of a mob of hoppers in a
little open forest pocket on top of
a near-by ironstone ridge. The
bucks immediately prepared for
action, and, quickly and quietly
encircling the base of the ridge,
advanced on the pocket behind
cover of a leafy bough, which each
man held up before him. The ’roos
were 30-odd in number, some lying
in the shade, a few nibbling. By
short stages, ever closer, the circle
of bushes hemmed in the pocket.
A resounding thud of a ’roo’s tail,
and every animal was on its
haunches. A circle of bushes in-
stantly dropped to the ground, and
yelling black fiends appeared, tear-
ing down from all sides upon the
startled animals. The latter fell
back upon one another in a be-
wildered bunch, and the first flight
of singing spears found them an
easy target. Only 10 of the ’roos
in the next few confused seconds
managed to break in blind terror
through the now complete circle.
The wounded animals were clubbed
to death, and in a very short time
the whole lot were roasting whole
in the tribal cooking-ovens.
“Kowsara”: The telepathic powers of the
Port Darwin gin who spent a whole day and night
lamenting that her man .Timmy would never come
back again (Jimmy was killed by an alligator .it
Arnheim Bay, 500 miles away, on the same day)
recall to me a Moreama cook-boy I employed on Wood-
lark Island. Late one blustery night, when all the
other store boys were well asleep in their sago-
thatched huts, he sneaked up to the bar counter, and
informed me: “Taubada, Captain Tom he go finish. Me
been see him fall overboard along big-fella wave.
Too true I talk along you.” Nine days later the
recruiting ketch Doinia returned to port, but with only
the native crew aboard. The master, my close friend
Captain Tom Gosling, had been lost overboard in
a sudden blow. The four card-players in the store
at the time laughed when I told them what the
boy had said, and advised me to kick him back to
his hut.
“Veronal”: Certain wild birds, especially
those which constantly frequent houses and the gar-
dens and shubberies around them, such as sparrows
and starlings, exhibit rather depraved tastes at
times. Starlings occasionally nip off the tender
flower-buds of roses, especially when no fruit is
available. During one season of drought a company
of crimson rosellas came and fed on the succulent
flowerbuds of a port-wine magnolia in my garden,
NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT.
“Hard an can’t meet his creditors.”
“ Can’t he just! tie can meet so many of them he’s gotten stay at home to keep out of
their way.”
while the fragrant white buds of an orange-tree also
suffered, the birds being short of their more natural
food supplies. Magpies (crow-shrikes) occasionally
nip off young cabbage and cauliflower plants, but
this is done partly through the love of mischief
inherent in Madge, as the plants are usually left
lying on the ground. I have watched a tame
magpie following a gardener setting out cabbage
plants, and as each plant was made comfortable in
t..e soil the bird would carefully pull it up and
drop it with a fiendish chuckle. Satin bower-birds
also at times visit gardens in quest of laurel, privet
and hawthorn berries, and they occasionally steal
a few mulberries ; so do the orioles and “blue jays”
or black-faced cuckoo-shrikes.
* * * *
“Castlereagh”: Toll “Boronia” that liis
friend (B. 6/11/’24) probably got oil on his cart-
ridge ; oil-soaked smokeless cartridges are always
likely to cause unpleasant results to the user. I
have a painful recollection of using a cartridge
that had become thus damaged through a bottle of
oil being spilt in my guncase. I was knocked down,
the fore-end was blown off, and the cross-bolt
locked. As my gun is of first-class English make,
1 can consider myself lucky; with a poorer gun
I could hardly have escaped so lightly.
* » * *
“Tally-Banyan”: Have any of you Abo.-
liars seen a white snake? I was chipping long blady-
grass along the edge of a small lagoon, and, on turn-
ing over a small rotten stump, a white snake, about
20in. long and as thick as one’s index-finger,
promptly did a glide-away. It did not appear to
be travelling very quickly—rather sluggishly, in
fact—-but when I tried to dissect it with a hoe, it
went like a streak, nor could I find it again.
* * * #
“Gouger”: In the jungles of N.Q. the
niggers go about at night waving a palm-leaf torch
among the damp undergrowth. Literally thousands
of frogs can thus be seen jumping along the rocky
creek banks. In daytime these hoppers squeeze
into the crannies of rocks, merge into the sur-
rounding landscape and are invisible. Rolled up
neatly in green leaves and gently roasted for
breakfast, the succulent morsels would tempt the
appetite of a vegetarian. As there are no bones
to pick, a lazy man can devour them without trouble.
* * * *
“E. Debro”: I have had a nodding
acquaintance with thousands of centipedes, but have
only seen one family that were phosphorescent. Rid-
ing home to camp from Duketown (W.A.) about
8 p.m., I noticed a peculiar glow fully 30 yards off
the track, and with visions of a fortune in radium
dismounted to investigate. Movement in the lumi-
nous mass caused me to light a match, when I dis-
covered mother centipede with a large progeny. I
stirred them up with a small twig, and then found
that each one emitted the phosphorescent glow. There
had been some rain during the afternoon, but I am
still at a loss to explain the phenomenon. Perhaps
mother had been living in a log that supplied some
phosphorescent element.
“001111/’: “Trevdee’s” fight between two
turkeys and a. snake in which the reptile killed both
birds (B. 6/11/’24) was, to say the least of it,
unusual. Turkeys, like most other feathered crea-
tures, are protected by the fact that practically all
their flesh is covered by fluff and feathers which
the reptiles’ venom fangs cannot penetrate. Theii
legs and the small areas around their beaks which
have no feathers are non-vascular, and even if the
fangs did strike there no harm would be done, for
the -reason that the tissue thereabouts contains no
blood-vessels to carry away the poison if it were
injected. Practically the only places where the
snake could cause any damage would be just behind
the wings, where the feathers are light and downy,
or, in the eyes, and both of these places would lie-
well covered-up during a fight. It is not so hard,
CONFIDENCES.
BARBER: “Your hair is very harsh and dry,
sir.”
VOICE-CULTURE EXPERT: “So is your voice;
hut I didn’t like to mention it.”
however, to credit the story of the turkeys having
killed the snake. Generally the turkey’s attack
takes the form of swift pecks just behind the head,
and, agile though the snake is, it does not succeed
usually in dodging more than one or two of these
blows. And one of them, when it gets home, is
enough to settle the crawler.

THE OLD BUCKBOARD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The fire burned low on the smithy forge and the
anvil seldom rang;
The dust was deep by the clinker heap and dull was
the sledge’s clang.
Cold was the hearth by the tyring plate where the
fires once flared and glowed
From early morn till the day was late, as the traffic
ebbed and flowed;
And bat-k in the yard, disused and old, the wrecks
of the pa.it were flung—
Cracked ribs and spokes of the days of gold ere the
change of years was rung.
But a paintless outcast held my gaze—a buckboard
deep in the sand—
And my heart, went back to the battling days on the
plains of the trackless land.
Men rose from rest as the morning star peeped up in
the eastern sky
To carry their worldly goods afar while the fierce
sun reigned on high ;
The hot tyres churned through the yielding sand and
over the floaters crashed,
Till darkness curtained the famished land and the
leaping campfires flashed.
Then under the loaded buckboard tray they sprawled
on a dusty bed
To smoke and slumber the night away while the
stars blazed overhead.
As grey light dawned on the saltbush plain they
warmed to the sweet “All’s well!”
The distant clink of the hobble chain and the clang
of the horse’s bell.
They hid their cares in the roaring years when the
outland leapt ablaze,
For the hopes of men weighed down all fears in the
restless roving days.
Their stores lay under the buckboard scat —their
dishes and picks and drills—
And fair was the morning sun that beat on the
spires of the lilac hills.
FANCY PICKING THAT!
THE WIFE: “ You’re drunk!”
THE WORM: “ Darling — hie—you're a mind-reader!”
The land was level, the grass was long and the range
its secret kept,
While the vagrant birds made joyous song on the
slopes where the treasure slept.
They climbed through the groves of sandalwood where
the quartz flashed white around,
And drove their pegs where the reef showed good
in the untried virgin ground.
On many a journey long and lean they’ve driven their
buc-kboards north ;
And the lakes were veiled in a false blue sheen
where mirages lured them forth.
But the rims were strong an 1 the spokes were true
through the longest day of doubt;
And the old horse always pulled them through to
the campfires further out.
They broke the quartz in the ranges dark and hot
with a barren blight,
In dismal scrubs where the wild dogs bark and
howl through the windy night;
The routes were heavy and waterless that led to the
Ninety Mile.
But they conquered leagues of the wilderness in the
grim unyielding style.
They shifted camp from the worked-out lead to follow
the deeper ore,
Where the stamp shoes fall on the battery feed and
the greedy ball mills roar.
They failed to gather a golden hoard, they sickened
of miner’s toil;
So they left the mines in the old buckboard to try
their luck on the soil.
They carted posts from the ridges brown, they
trotted to fight the fire;
And often the buckboard left the town with a load
of fencing-wire.
They drove their families, stowed like sheep, for a
picnic far in the scrub
Or sprawled on the buckboard floor asleep bound home
from the township pub.
The old buckboard was a ration cart behind the
travelling flock,
And into the crowded auction mart it’s followed the
primest stock;
But now it lies in the blacksmith’s yard, a wreck
of the battling days,
That bit the track for the after-guard whose scorn
is quicker than praise.
The sand falls over the broken rims and the last
account is paid
For the worn-out wheels and twisted limbs—sad
relics of vanished trade.
Ah, seldom the anvil rings to greet the birth of a
thriving day,
And they ride no more on the buckboard seat to the
hills leng miles away 1

“Akran”: Two wanderers bumped Lismore
the other afternoon. I was in the bar when they
drifted in and deposited Matilda at their feet. Busi-
ness being slack, they struck up a yarn with the boss.
They’d tramped from Cunnamulla, over the border.
The talk drifted to the different liquors each had
sampled. “That was vicious stuff we filled up on at
Cunnamulla the night before we left. It was called
beer,” said the little chap. “But, Hogan’s ghost! it
was good compared with some we sampled at Mun-
gindi.” “Cripes,” said the taller of the two, “that
was great rum they dished out. They’d been throwing
it out on to a bed of violets near the bar window,
and they came up tiger-lilies.”
* * * *
“W.P.T.”: A family at Wyndham
(N.S.W. South Coast) was taking with it to the
North Coast its pet kangaroo. The people boarded
the s.s. Merimbula at Eden, but were only a few
hours out when the kangaroo jumped overboard. The

steamer was then at least a mile from the nearest
land, and, thinking that kangaroos were unable to
swim, they shut their eyes to avoid watching their
pet sink to the bottom. They were greatly surprised
a few days later to receive a telegram stating that
their kangaroo had found its way, not only ashore,
but to its former home at Wyndham, 30 miles in-
land. This pet had .no Tommy Adrian to coach him
either.
■ “Wessel”: The ancient Egyptians invented
something besides pyramids and mummies, and every
Australian who lives in mosquito country ought to
feel a little grateful to them. It was the Egyptians
of the Delta who invented mosquito nets 3000 years
or so ago. Good old Herodotus tells us that in
order to be able to sleep in peace, these dwellers in
the marshes covered themselves with nets. He adds
that they used the nets in the daytime for catching
fish.
* * * »
“The Wlialaw”: Re “Davrick’s” par. on
his friend’s fencing record (B. 25/'9/’24), what kind
of soil was his friend “putting up” in? Sand?
Forty-five posts a day 22in.
in the ground is good going
in black soil, or 50 a day
20in. deep. That is when
the posts are all laid on
the line. And anything over
100 a day in hardwood posts
six inches through would
not be bad boring. So that
“Davrick’s” friend did the
work of three good men in
one day. He is either a
superman or a super-yarn-
spinner.
* *
“Pick” : A muggy sum-
mer afternoon is chosen by
the young of the white-ant
colonies for swarming. In
countless myriads, temporarily
provided with wings, they
then pour out from the runs
their fathers have excavated
in the house, fence or timber-
stack, to seek a new field for
their depredations. There
is, doubtless, some insect
regulation that cuts off thii
exodus when sufficient, in
number have gone to ensure
room and provender for
those remaining. It is ap-
parent, too, that scouts have
arranged a new settlement
for the trekkers. Though
seemingly they gyrate aim-
lessly in the open after their
departure, the swarmers all
settle about the one place.
Then their wings drop off,
and in an amazingly short
time they have all congre-
gated under a floor or in a
post crevice. It is during
the one and only flight of
the white-ant swarm that the
English starling and house-
sparrow disprove the charge
against themselves of being
useless and noxious importa-
tions. In flocks the birds
come to the banquet, and
the insect ravagers reach
their new home in vastly
depleted numbers.
THE TROUBLE IN STORE.
THE INCORRIGIBLE: “Ah, well, I’ve ’ad me drop of beer an’ me
pipe o’ ’baeca, too, every day goin’ on for sixty year, an'
I’ve never felt none the worse for them yet.”
THE PARSON: “Yes, yes, but they’ll be the death of you some
day, and I sadly fear you’ll begin to feel the effects of
them then.”
“Bungarra”: Someone is going to lose liis
way if he uses “Lily-Beale’s” nardoo plant as a
compass (B. G/11/’24). He says the leaves of this
herb lie on the ground facing the
east at dawn, at noon they are per-
pendicular, and at sunset they lie
along the ground facing the west.
As a matter of fact they are erect
at dawn. When the first rays of the
sun strike them they turn slowly
towards the east, but do not lie
along the ground. During the day
they follow the sun, and in the even-
ing are pointing definitely westward.
The direction, however, is at the best
only approximate. If, for example,
they are shaded on one side by a
tree, as they frequently are, the leaves
will point towards the direction of
the light, i.e., away from the tree.
They may therefore point north or
south and not east or west. The
nardoo’s habit of following the sun
is shared by thousands of other plants
wild and cultivated. The telling of
the time from the amount of their
movement is a lazy man’s device for
avoiding the trouble of looking up
to see the position of the sun.
“Uramao”: The Maori is
getting impatient of old tribal super-
stitions. Three Maoris were drowned
in a North Island settlement, and all
the water in the vicinity—the Whakiki
Lagoon, and a considerable stretch
of sea from Mahia to Arapawanui—
was placed under tapu in accordance
with immemorial custom. But the
Maoris, dwelling on the tuna, carp
and shark that were going to waste
in the waters, put it to the head peas
that 12 months was too long for the
observance, nni the arguments over-
bore the high priests, who lifted the tapu after a few
months.
* * * *
“Pommy” : The Zebu cattle originally in-
troduced to Fiji by the late lamented Leslie Brown
are flourishing exceedingly, and their half- and
quarter-caste progeny are providing excellent working
bullocks and juicy beef. They seem to fatten where
other cattle will starve —like the human species
from India, they can live on the smell of tucker.
The Fijians have dubbed them “Pulumakau daku-
fusi,” “daku” being the Fijian for back, while
“fusi” is, of course, pussy, or cat. This (“fusi”) is
Fijian for all hump-backed creatures. They don’t
seem to have noticed that pussy’s back isn’t always
arched.
* * * *
“Broome”: Tell “McG.” (B. 25/9/24)
that the dugong finds a happy hunting-ground in
its thousands on the n.-w. coast of W.A., as far south
as Shark’s Bay. Anywhere amongst the islands and
in the sheltered bays, inlets, etc., where the sandy
mud bottom grows long green grass, the schools will
keep the harpooner busy. Dugong meat can be bought
any week in Broome. After a little boiling it is
cooked as an ordinary roast; it is often served to
the unsuspecting as veal. There’s no fishy or oily
flavor about it. Cured in strips as bacon,, it is
most appetising. A party of pioneers on Graham
Moore Island lived on it all last year, and Brother
Binghi seems to prefer it to turtle. There is an
opening for a profitable industry on the n.-w. coast,
for the whole mammal is marketable. The hide
hard-tanned, makes splendid anti-friction leather:
soft-tanned and split, it is impervious to water and
excellent for boots, washers, etc. The flesh is good
food, or rendered down with the innards will produce
eight to ten gallons of oil equal to the best cod-liver
oil, and as a rheumatic embrocation it cannot be
equalled. The bones are solid and are a good sub-
stitute for ivory ; the intestines will supply catgut:
the residue should make first-rate fertiliser.
•» * * *
“Beetleerusher”: In the eastern part of
New Britain the natives do not eat together. The
Marys prepare the food and the children taJce it
to the men. who turn their backs to the Marys to eat.
It is a common sight to see women with pigs at the
breast; the young men are often sighted carrying
about young pigs thus reared, to whom they talk
with apparent understanding. i
* * * *
“Lily-Beale” : We have no need to go to
Arizona for petrified forests. Near Coolah, in the |
Mudgee (N.S.W.) district, is a hillside covered with
fallen forest giants, which the ages have converted
into stone. The trees were pine, but it is not sure
whether they were of the same species as the pine
now growing in the district.
* * * *
“Troophorse” : The late Paddy Cahill, so
well known in connection with N.T. buffalo-hunting,
was an excellent shot. One time whilst shooting
near Oenpelli, East Alligator River, Paddy had not
seen a trace of buffalo for three weeks, and was about
to return to his camp, when he spotted a large herd
away out on the plain. Luck was his that day, for
the wind was coming away—-right off the beasts.
Ir. one gallop, without drawing rein, Paddy shot 27
of the mob, and his team of niggers cleaned up most of
the rest. A good rifle-shot, possibly the present crack
of the North, is “Singapore Joe.” Several years
ago the Darwin meatworks were overstocked with
cats, and the management put Joe on the pay-roll
as cat-shooter. Cats were shot in every fancy position
that cats (and only cats) can get into; tame cats,
wild cats, house cats—in fact, every variety of cat"
was blown off the earth. After the slaughter the
skins were shipped south. I once lent a shotgun
and two cartridges to a nigger, who walked out to
the 10-Mile Lagoon (Pine Creek line) and returned
at sundown with 22 ducks, 2 geese and 2 diver-ducks,
and handed over the gun with one cartridge. He
reported that he had crawled into the lagoon and
waited until all the game was in a bunch; then he
had let drive, wringing the necks of those he didn’t
kill outright.
* * * *
“Boronia”: The Westralian red-gum tree
mentioned by “Billy See” (B. 23/10/’24) is not
highly valuable as a timber; it has too many gum-
veins and too great an attraction for white ants.
Nevertheless, it deserves respect for its dyeing and
tanning possibilities. The vegetable is rich in potash
also. During the war this fact was exploited by
a number of Groperland fruitgrowers who, unable to
secure potash, used to burn red-gum logs and strew
the fine white ash around their trees. That the trees
benefited was obvious from the dark green color of
their foliage.
* * * *
“Harvib”: In complaining of the misery
given stock through long distant transport by rail,
“Seashells” (B. IG/10/’24) suggests that lving-down
room be provided. Light loading would be more
cruel than over-crowding, because every heavy jolt
(and stock trains can jolt) would be disastrous.
Quicker transportation is the only humane remedy.
* * * *
“Maedee” : Recently I was travelling along
a road in Northern Victoria which runs parallel to
the railway line. About a mile away on the line,
and travelling in my direction, I noticed a man
seated on a railway trolly, and trotting a few feet
in front of him a big dog. When they drew level
with me the trolly-rider pulled up for a yam, and
then I saw that the dog was harnessed to the con-
veyance. The dog was a big nondescript chap, and
his owner explained that Towser always helped on
the upgrades. On the back of the trolly was a
small platform on which the dog rode on the down-
grades. Towser’s feet were encased in “boots,” pads
of leather fastened around them to keep the rough
ballast from cutting liis feet. After a few minutes’
yarn Towser’s master gave the signal to go, and
with a yap he strained on his traces.
* * * *
“Melos”: “Jack and the Beanstalk” has a
parallel in Ballugarh and the vine-stalk, a legend
of the Richmond River aborigines. One day Ballug-
arh wandered along a mountain, at the base of
which dwelt a tribe of hostile giants. He was about
to retrace his steps, when he saw two beautiful
girls—daughters of the giants—getting water from
a pool at the base of the mountain. Fascinated by
their beauty, he threw pebbles into the water fo
attract their attention, and then asked them for
fire to warm his chilled limbs. They immediately
got firesticlcs and climbed a vine which reached
from the base of the mountain to the summit. The
giants saw the indiscretion and came in a body to
the vine and began the ascent. Ballugarh waited
until the tribe had gone well aloft and then cut the
vine with disastrous results to the climbers. Then
there was a wedding with two brides in it—and only
one bridegroom.
* * * *
“Centre” : Pulling in my line to re-bait the
hook, I saw, as it came near the surface, a strongly
luminous something that I took to be some form
of sea-snake. On lifting it clear of the water it
showed as a pencil-thick thread of colorless jelly,
without any sign of luminosity. On taking hold
of it to free the line, 1 felt a distinct though faint
tingle through my arm, as from a weak electric
shock. The creature measured about 2ft. in length
and was apparently spineless. It made no movement
whatever after being taken from the water, but on
TOOK THE WRONG TURNING.
KIND GENTLEMAN: “Wotsa matter , little
girl?”
LITTLE GIRL: “Ow-wow ! I’ve swallowed me
lolly — an’ — an’—I want it up again!”
my throwing it overboard again it at once resumed
its snakelike appearance, and glowed again faintly
as it headed rapidly for the bottom. It was caught
near the Barrier Reef, out from Townsville. Those
with me had seen nothing like it before; and it
was new to me. Is it known to any of the Council?
DELORAINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The little hills of Deloraine lie drowsy through
the hours,
Brown with furrowed fallow-lands and white with
orchard-bowers.
Through the quiet morning comes the magpies’
fluting
Mingling with the cadence of the low winds' luting.
All my spirit sighs again
For the hills of Deloraine!
Ihe little fields of Deloraine are spilled with sweet-
ness over,
Glinting with the C'apeweed’s gold and cream with
honeyed clover;
Bronze reeds mirrored in the pools and green wheat
swaying,
Tranquil in the twilights when the bright West’s
greying.
Deep in drought, my heart would fain
Find the fields of Deloraine!
The little roads of Deloraine go winding up and down,
IV here the bay horse canters homeward and the grey
jogs on to town;
Brimmed with bracken, set with brier, and fringed
with seeding grasses,
Burnt dust scented sweetly when the fleet rain passes.
Could the feet that follow pain
Take the turn to Deloraine!
The little homes of Deloraine lie snugly and con-
tented
Glider lofty arching of the blue skies tented;
Gemmed with placid pools of flower and girt with
guardian pine,
Still they call my homeless heart to joys that once
were mine.
Twenty years of sun and rain
Have touched the homes of Deloraine.
The far range calls the bush-bred, the luring town
the gay ;
The rover takes the long trail from the blue lanes of
the bay.
But, the heart-sick and the weary ones, it's there that •
they should be
In the green ways of Deloraine that seem so fair
to me.
But I shall never find again
The road to youth or Deloraine.

A Significant Fact!
Motorists must appreciate the fact that we are not afraid to put our standard stock
Dunlop Cord Tyres to the severest possible road tests that Australia can provide #
The more gruelling the conditions the better —from our point of view—as they serve to further demon-
strate to motorists the undoubted superiority of

for real hard driving on our roads and tracks.
No other make of tyres _ Australian or imported have ever been subjected to such
a series of brutal tests, from which the Dunlop Cords have come with flying coiors,
proving our claim that these tyres are unapproached for hard service and dependability under Australian
conditions.
Here are some of the remarkable achievements made possible by the staunchness of Dunlop Cords

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-

SILK
STOCKINGS
Last Saturday’s southerly blew all the
powder off Manly’s nose; and that lotus
strand felt particularly annoyed about it,
because she had arranged a date with King
Neptune. She had sent him and his Court a
card for her annual regatta; and when the
entourage with great pomp draped them-
selves pictorially about the cargo wharf, and
Mayor Samuels was bidding them welcome
on behalf of the lady with the Continental
manner and the Pacific-blown hair, the
weather delivered both civic and sea lord a
sounding smack on the cheek. The Binn-
garra was the flagship, and was crowded with
guests; but in spite of jazz and pipe bands,
the merry flow of girlish chat intermingled
with the baritone of the instructive male
dried up under the touch of the gale. Doris
Williams covered herself with glory by
winning the single sculls for ladies and the
mixed doubles with J. Degotardi. But the
Water Police, picking up the survivors from
overturned skiffs, were the heroes of the
hour.
The Marella gave itself over to the fun
"'f the fair last Thursday, when hundreds of
girls and boys came out to play about its
broad and shining decks. The skipper of
the craft has notched his mark in the scroll
of famous showmen, for what with chutes
and fascinating games in the gym. and real
dancing and fast dancing on a slippery deck
for the adventurous, there never had been
such an afternoon in the memory of the
kiddies. The merry-go-round was in aid of
the Adult Deaf and Dumb, and Burns-Pliilp
not only lent the boat but also provided the
afternoon tea and the ices necessary to the
party’s well-being; so the committee feels
that manna from Heaven isn’t altogether un-
known even in this age of sceptics.
Even if the moon hadn’t raised her lamp
above the Marella there were enough bright
lights, fair to brunette women and jazzing
gents, to make the party in aid of Prince
Alfred one of the jolliest that the end of the
year is likely to know. A team of girls,
headed by Dallie Thomson, Billy Norrie and
Enid .Ellis, had swung the venture to success
in spite of a delay in the date, and Captain
Mortimer and his men were responsible for
many a maid’s and matron’s enjoyment. Red-
headed gums, seemingly all the flags in B.P.’s
locker and a polished harbor that mirrored
back the stars and the curtseying ferry-lights
were a few more ingredients of the perfect
night. The hospital’s organising secretary,
Mrs. Charlie Walker, passed on her way in
brocades that suggested the purple vats of
Tyre; treasurer Jane Vowles dressed her-
self from A to Z in the gentlest of blue bro-
cades; Mrs. Harold Yale, in black georgette,
was one of the evening’s attractions," and
Phyllis Yale came from Leura to be in the
picture.
The dry Mr. Hammond should be able to
build a dyke of silver against the tide of
beer when the ultimate shilling from the
Great White Fair rolls up. The fair, which
was first spoken of by Miss Preston Stanley
six months ago in the mayoral lady’s boudoir,
burst into bloom (and bloomers) last week.
The basement of the Town Hall stored the
sewing and ripping of busy hands, and the
stalls were piled with extraordinary bargains
in the way of house linen, kiddies’ frocks
and undies. But the greatest joy was the
doll stall: 500 of the beauties, flaxen and
gold and brown heads above blue and brown
eyes. Here were dolls with lids that drooped
sleepily and lashes that curled entrancingly
-which of the 500 lucky little girls who got
one wanted to be a boy?
The Town Hall stage burst into magni-
ficence for the testimonial concert to Queens-
land songbird Ethel Osborn on Saturday
night. Yellow roses were flung about in the
reckless spirit advocated in Herrick’s poems
and red, red roses arched the lady’s entrances
and exits. Furthermore, light streamed
swooningly from amber-shaded standard
lamps, and Beales, who lent the piano, were
sufficiently msthetie not to blazon it forth in
mile-long letters on the side of the instru-
There bas been so much written about
Ethel s voice that it is hardly possible to
drip another word of encouragement into
V?®. ea P- Saturday she sang even such
difficult numbers as “The Hymn to the Sun - ’
amazingly well, and she herself was pleasant
to look upon in spite of being frocked in
something that brought to mind Marie Kino-
Hall s story of absent-minded mother’s dress*
making: “An’ now the chairs on the porch
are wearing my summer dress an’ I’m wear-
ing the covers intended for the chairs.” Frank
Hutchens, Gerald Walenn, Harrison Allen
and Victor McMahon added their gifts to
the glory of the girl with the brilliant future;
and teacher Roland Foster unfurled a banner
of speech during the interval.
Cranbrook C. of E. School needs a new
gymnasium, and hundreds danced in the one-
time Government House ballroom last Satur-
day night to help pay for it. Penelope Cay
was secretary of the Upper Crust flutter, and
there was a great roll-up to her rally. The
Principal did the honors, aided by Mrs.
Perkins in black satin and jet: good-natured
Mrs. Jimmy Ashton wore her well-known
smile above black georgettes : Justice Harvey
brought his lady; and Mrs. Richard Meares's
lavender and lace had an old-time air. Rose
Merivale and Mrs. Aubrey Halloran were
other dancers.
The dark-eyed Forsayth girleen chose a
sunny afternoon last week for her plunge into
matrimony, with Leslie Falkiner as her life-
buoy. The picturesquely-situated church of
St. Michael’s at the bride’s own village, Vau-
cluse, supplied the background for the bridal
ivory and gold brocades. Father’s arm and
an enveloping tulle veil on which gold roses
had been scattered by the hands of the
embroiderer were pillars of strength to the
fluttering principal, while four ’maids, look-
ing like a Spring song in skyey-blue georg-
ettes that fluffed about their calves in a crop
of feathery fronds, added to the pictorial
effect. Small John Falkiner, in blue satin
suit and pleated georgette frills, might have
stepped straight out of a nursery rhyme illus-
trated by Kate Greenaway. Fred Knight, of
Melbourne, himself one of the newly be-
trothed, best-manned his cousin; and Roy
McCaughey and Hector Forsayth were re-
serves. The happy pair stood up to the con-
gratulations at the Forsayth homestead,
Vaucluse Hall.
Justice James and his well-gilded wife did
daughter Enid proud at St. James’s, in King-
street, when father handed her over to Dr.
Victor Coppleson. Enid is a pretty girl who
sprang to fame when the Prince danced with
her at Government House, and Victor is a
Macquarie-street brass-plater who between
cases lives in the surf at Rondi. Enid
clothed her great moment in billows of snowy
georgette that swished a froth of lilac-tinted
train in its wake. A mountain mist of tulle
and a sheaf of white November lilies were
added for good measure. Bride’s sister,
Irene, and sparkling little Isabel Fraser
(she’s scheduled for a New Year bride), in
feather-flounced fuchsia-toned silk and ducky
little silver-tissue turbans drawn tightly to
their shingles by chin-straps, stepped de-
murely after the bride. Drs. Peter Murphy
and John Brown stood by the ’groom ; and
the bride’s father and mother spread the
feast at the Wentworth.
This is sweet Anne Dangar, Julian Ash-
ton’s chief assistant at the Sydney Art
School. This week the lady is very busy
“managing” the show of s.udeuts’ work in
the long nar-
row studio at
the Queen Vic-
toria Markets,
where a few
years ago her
own work took
the eye of
Julian and his
then first
lieutenant,
Elioth Gruner.
Anne has
never grown
to look upon
her work as a
job, so she
takes her
classes cheer-
fully the year
round. S h e
used to have a
weekly holiday,
and kept Fri-
day sacred for
setting her little house at Newport in order;
but during the year some of the embryo Lam-
berts and Streetons wanted another sketch
club formed, so Anne gave up her Fridays to
them. When she was approached about it
she listened thoughtfully, and then said:
“Well, if yo can see your wa? to contribute
enouvh tc pay a woman to clean my cottage
every Frida 1 ". I can manage.” No word of
fees or fares for herself —that’s Anne Dangar.
North Shore liners had a pretty wedding
to themselves the other night, when Marjorie
Boyce, of Pymble, and Dr. Scrivener, of
Gordon, linked up at the local St. James’s.
Bride’s grandfather, Archdeacon Boyce, and
Canon Langley, her uncle, tied the knot that
was shaken into position by Padre Connolly,
ivory satin with silver embossings, a cloth
of silver train and a sheaf of November lilies
helped to round off the ensemble. Bride’s
sister Merrill and Helga Halberg adventured
lilac and lavender blues with a satisfactory
result, and sw*athed their heads in turbans
of silver tissue and lilac georgette. Little
Nora Boyce and Lucy Martin, in a sunset
effect of blue and pink, made a colorful
background. A brother medicine-man, Dr.
Tillett, of Orange, gave the ’groom first-aid,
and Roy Scrivener supplied the anaesthetic
of song. The wedding party was roofed at
Athol, the bride’s home.
Some weeks ago when Brenda Deloitte
broke off her engagement with Padre Mewton
Stephen, and her friend Mrs. Arthur Scri-
vener was posted at St. Andrew’s to say that
there’d be no wedding, she reckoned without
Dan Cupid. The thought of that wasted
arrow was too much for him. A fortnight
after the unlieaval Brenda sailed for Maori-
land, and, dragged by a man friend, her
Padre lover went down to the wharf to
timidly smile at her from afar. Just as the
boat moved off Brenda relented and waved
a hand. The result was that a reverend
gentleman took tne following boat to Auck-
land, and three days after his arrival Brenda
bacame Mrs. Mewton Stephen.
This is Monte Luke’s picture of Mrs. Ger-
trude Melville, Labor’s woman-candidate for
Eastern Suburbs. This blue-eyed woman
with the simple directness of a frank school-
boy drifted
into political
work on the
day she re-
corded her first
vote. Some-
body came up
to her as she
emerged from
the booth, and
said: “You
look as though
you could do
it —how would
you like to
come and help
round up
voters?” That
was the spark
that set the
fire of politi-
cal ambitions
going. Mrs.
Melville is the
level - headed
vice-president of the Randwick Labor
League, is a member of the A.L.P. execu-
tive, and one of the chief spirits in the
Women’s Central Organising Committee. For
years she has worked to put other members
into the House; this election she will give
the women of Eastern Suburbs a chance to
make her one of their representatives. The
chief plank in her platform is motherhood
endowment; and she knows all about mother-
hood, for there are several baby Melvilles
for whom, in spite of her public activities,
she cooks, washes and mends. She does all
this by stretching her day from (5 a.m. to
very near midnight.
These days of many holidays housewives
are often at their wits' end to know what to
tempt “him” with. They will find a useful
article on “Meatless Meals” in next Tues-
day’s Mirror. There is also, among a host of
others, an entertaining article on “The Reign
of Middle-aged Men,” and an instructive one
on “Running a Tea-room.” A serial by
Ethel Turner, stories, verse, articles on
housework, sewing, babies, cooking, love-
letters and getting married, a free paper
pattern and dress designs are a few of the
bargains to be had for threepence.
The Queensland Insurance McVernon
couple are among those who return by the
Niagara after a world-tour of unusual inter-
est. One of their happiest recollections is
of a visit to Perthshire, where they put up
at the famous Gleneagles Hotel, and played
golf on the adjacent lovely links.
Mrs. Aubrey Withers is dead, but the new
boy settlers are to enjoy the fruits of her
sowing in the years when she founded the
Rush Book Club. These boy settlers, youths
of 14 to 20, are usually sent off to employ-
ment in the back country, and the isolation
must be the greatest trial of all to lads from
the crowded older countries. So the Bush
Book Club is enrolling the lads as members,
and is sending out a call for suitable books,
travel and adventure stories and novels of
action are particularly desired. Barbara
Knox, Dorothea Mackellar and Gladys Owen
are opening a depot at Edgecliff Post Office
on Saturday next, where they will take
delivery of books from 9 till 1 o’clock.
Rose Merivale, the energetic secretary of
the Havilah Homes, is on the warpath again.
Next year the committee of these C. of E
hostels for children hopes to establish a
babies’ home at Manly and a home at Leura
for girls from eight vears. So far the scheme
is excellent, and worthy of Sydney’s support.
But when the circular adds that the little
girls are to be trained for domestic, service
the average Australian woman will hope that
they will at least be given a chance to develop
m other directions.
Mrs. Walter Swinson is having an after-
noon party next Sunday at the home nest in
Turramurra to introduce Essie Aekland. the
pretty and talented singer, to North Shore
line music-lovers.
T £ e old lad y of Lome, Killara, died
on Nov. 29. Youngest daughter of the late
Major Henry Antill, who came as A.D.C. on
the staff of Governor Macquarie, Selina mar-
ried the late Captain Pockley, one of the
youngest master-mariners who ever brought
a ship to Sydney. She was 88 at the time of her
death. The late Mrs. Pockley, as a bride, chose
the then bushy district near the northern
foreshores of the harbor for her home. Much
later came Lome, where the gum-tree still
shakes its leafy head and shy bush birds
stalk boldly on garden lawns. Picton, which
was a grant to old Henry Antill. has had
a good deal of unwelcome attention from
the rabbit, but the wide farm lands, with
the original homestead. Jarvisfield, as head-
quarters, are still tilled by “Squire” Harry,
grandson of the first owner.
Mrs. Paddy Nolan and musical critic Pat
himself—the twain are not long home from
New York—gave a little Pekoe party at
Farmer’s the other day. The gathering was
to farewell Maoriland writer Nellie Scanlan,
who is going back to the land of the kiwi.
The pemvoman has written her way round
America and seen a lot of Europe in the past
three years. She has chatted with President
Coolidge at the White House, and in the
Wembley season in London had a handclasp
from Queen Mary, who was entirely sur-
rounded by 4000 top-hats. Nellie got a
sudden glimpse of the strain that the most
accustomed Royal entertainer feels at a vast
gathering of that kind. The hand the Queen
placed in that of the M.L. presswoman was
trembling like a sensitive plant.
“The Wild Moth,” from the pen of Queens-
land’s poetic Mrs. Forrest, has stepped into
a new edition. The busy woman has posted'
off a second novel to Cassells’. She hopes to
be in Sydney soon after Christmas.
The Segaert family leaves for a trip to
its native land by the Ormonde early next
year. But, to everybody’s great delight,
father has been notified that he is to return
to Sydney.
Sydney Grammar’s chatelaine, Mrs. Dett-
man, gave a bunch of her Maoriland rela-
tions a great send-off to their Windy Isle
last week. The MacCallums. of Auckland
and Wellington, were the principal guests,
though singing Mary MacCormick, of Auck-
land, came in for a fair share of notice.
The drawing-room of the Australia was like
a censer of summer, and streams of rose,
honeysuckle and carnation perfume poured
through the atmosphere. Mrs. Dettman
topped ivory lace frocking with a black pic-
ture hat.
Sir Matthew has been up to the Downs to hand
out the annual rewards of industry to the good boi's
of Toowoomba Grammar School. Chairman l)r.
Freshney said General Robertson and Dr. Falkner
were the major instigators of the jubilee fund to get
a chemical laboratory, tennis courts, a library and
swimming pools. With a silver trowel his Ex. satis-
factorily laid the foundation stone of the Lab. Head-
master Barbour said the school attendance in July
had passed all previous high-water marks. The
Chelmsford Cup, which Toowoomba tore from Ipswich
in the annual sports, gleamed on high. The school
has not been beaten at cricket or football for two
years, and it now listens-in on its own wireless set.
Sir Matthew dined the Douglases, Mrs. Arthur
Clark, Margaret Haymen, Nell Kirwan, North Hal-
ford and Messrs. Gilligan, Toone and Chapman,
of the visiting cricket team, with Captain Turner
to over-see.
Captain Saunders went with his Ex. to the Queens-
land State orchestral concert, on a very hot night,
in the Exhibition Concert Hall. Earlier in the
evening Sir Matthew was at Barbara Sisley’s recitai
ir. the Elite. Tall Barbara wore black brocade and
got many vegetable tributes.
Mrs. Eve organised a jazz afternoon at Lennon’s to
help along the Christmas spread for the widows and
orphans of soldiers and sailors. Some 300 came to
see and hear a hilariously mixed programme. Flowers
were handed to all the feminine performers, and
Jack Filielly, for Mrs. Eve, offered up thanks.
The Austral choir were at home at the E. W. H.
Fowles’ place in a setting of royal blue and tan-
gerine. E. R. B. Jordan disclosed the programme
for 1895.
The Causerie Francaise had its shivoo- in the
Women’s Club. The Tardent and Rochat damsels
were in a comedy; and amongst the throng were
the Count and Countess de Tournouei;, Mesdames
Tardent and C. A. Macfarlane, and Kathleen Lyons.
William Heughan has been back in the Elite, and
his audiences, on both nights, included the Lockhart
Gibsons, Boyd Cullen, Waughs, Gibsons, Dobbies,
Forrests, Tessa Reading, Kitsons and Maetaggarts.
The pipe band piped wildly in the hall, and heather
and roses were cast at the kilted songbird.
For the aged nurses rest-home, “Trial by Jury”
was staged in the Elite, Jacksons, Raffs and Hal-
fords being amongst the audience.
Mrs. George Nathan and daughter Pamela have
gone south, era route for China.
Seven hundred strong we went to Lennon’s to see
the mannequin parade and Mah Jongg and bridge
affray for the Seamen’s Institute building fund. Bris-
bane’s youth and beauty helped, and for the bridal
parade Mrs. Bruce Nichol lent a century-old lace
veil, Alice Hollander and others from the Empire
and W intergarden theatres gave a musical programme.
The members of the College campaign committee
were given afternoon tea at the Women’s College.
Dr. Jean White Haney said that over £l2OO had
been collected, with more to come from outside
districts.

RITA MOYA discourses on
NATURAL BEAUTY
and how to obtain it.
Good Shampoo Important. —The hair
should be allowed to breathe, and the
greasy film around each strand must be re-
moved with a mild non-alkaline shampoo.
Soaps should be tabooed. The very best
solution for the purpose can be made by
dissolving a teaspoonful of stallax granules
in a cup of hot water. It stimulates the
scalp to healthy action, and at the same
time leaves the hair in that soft, fluffy con-
dition so much admired. Any chemist can
supply vou with an original packet of stal-
lax, sufficient to make 25 to 30 shampoos.
Magic for Superfluous Hair. —lt is
astounding the number of women who suf-
fer from unsightly growths of hair on the
face, and it will come as a piece of good
news to know that there is a simple sub-
stance known as powdered pheminol
which will remove it immediately. Mix
a small quantity into a thin paste
with a little water, and apply to the objec-
tionable growths. In two minutes all trace
of the hair will have entirely vanished, and
your skin will be as soft and smooth as a
child's. Pheminol is also invaluable for re-
moving hair from the underarms.
To have Smooth, White Skin all
through the Year. —Does your skin chap
or roughen easily, or become unduly red
or blotchy? Let me tell you a quick and
easy way to overcome the trouble and keep
your complexion beautifully white, smooth
and soft. Just get some pure mercolized
wax at the chemist’s, ahd use a little before
retiring as you would use cold cream. The
wax, through some peculiar action, pain-
lessly flecks off the rough, discolored or
blemished skin. The worn-out cuticle comes
off just like dandruff on a diseased scalp,
only in almost invisible particles. Merco-
lized wax simply hastens Nature’s work,
which is the rational and proper way to
attain a perfect complexion, so much sought
after. The process is perfectly simple and
quite harmless.
For Dry, Irritating and Dandruffy
Scalps. —Nothing can compare with the
following recipe for the above condition, and
until you have rectified any trouble in this
direction it is useless to expect the hair to
grow healthy and vigorous. Mix a package
of boranium with j-pint of bay rum, shake
the bottle well and allow to stand for 30
minutes, then add 1-pint cold water and
strain. This simple home remedy will
stimulate the hair-roots to their normal
| functions.
Rouge Not Necessary. — lf you must
add a little color to the cheeks please do
not use rouge; it is always so painfully
obvious that women of refinement have now
discarded it for ever. There is a splen-
did substance called colliandum obtain-
able at most chemist’s, which can be used in
its place. It gives a perfectly natural tint
and defies the closest scrutiny, besides hav-
ing the undoubted advantage of not rubbing
off.
The Powder Puff Passes. —A persist-
ently shiny nose, or a dull, lifeless com-
plexion drives many a woman to cosmetics
and consequently despair. And all the
time a simple remedy is obtainable. Get
from your chemist a package of clemin-
ite.. and add sufficient water to dissolve it.
A little of this simple lotion is Nature’s own
benutifier. It is very good for the skin and
instantly gives the complexion a soft, vel-
vety. youthful bloom that any woman might
envy. It lasts all day or evening, renders
powdering entirely unnecessary, and abso-
lutely defies detection.
Miscellaneous Hints. —For lips inclined
to be rough or harsh use a soft stick of
prolactum. An ideal complexion soap is
one called pilenta. It contains no free alkali,
and is as near neutrality as science can make
it.
To make the eyelashes grow long, dark
and curling, massage them gently with
mennaline. It is quite a harmless substance,
and will not injure the eyes.

Melbourne
The question of “where to stay” when
you plan to visit Melbourne is best
answered by Scott’s —Melbourne's most
central hotel.
The Newly-completed Extension
makes this modern hotel more attractive
than ever, by providing an Enlarged Dining
room, Spacious Lounge, Bedrooms with Baths
attached, and all modern comforts.
These new innovations, together with the
constantly maintained high standard of com-
fort, cuisine and service, are features that
firmly sustain Scott’s pre-eminence.
There is No Better Hotel
at Which You Can Stay.

Gladys Moncrieff slipped from her “Merry
Widow” trappings on Saturday night into
the dazzle of her “Sybil” frockings. Of
course, the packed house cheered her to the
echo, and the gods yowled appreciation with
a complete lack of discretion. This time
Blake Adams shared the appreciation, and
Claude Fleming did not go unrecognised.
Afterwards Gladys smiled her thanks over
an armful of water-lilies. The John Taits
beamed on the show from the managerial
pen. And no wonder they beamed : the sea-
son must be proving a gold-mine.
Singer Amy Castles hostessed the Decem-
ber at-home of the Austral Salon. Black
georgette frocked her comely person, and
her welcoming smiles were shaded by a big
black hat. An all-star musical menu sand-
wiched the tea-drinking. Sister Eileen
Castles, looking like a telephone doll in
frilly silken skirtings of powder blue, was
chief singing bird; and Cecil Parkes fiddled
expertly to piano backings from his small
brother Milton. Amy’s voice got one of its
first hearings at a Salon gathering, and she
has been an enthusiastic Salonitc ever since.
Saturday’s garden-fete, which did its noble
best, in the Toorak Glamorgan paddocks, to
weight the Free Kindergarten coffers, was a
brilliantly-staged effort. The sun shone as it
has not shone for months; yet the paddocks
were not really profitably peopled. The
stallholders loosed their own pursestrings
freely. And thev were great stalls, some of
them —good-looking Mrs. MacCallum Neil
commanded a flower barrow which would
have turned a professional florist green with
envy. Big Neville Towne used his well-
balanced baritone in the concert hall—and
acted as doorkeeper between warbles.
The Victorian Artists’ Society members
used their East Melbourne Galleries one day
last week for a sliivoo of ultra-Philistine
quality, in honor of their new president,
John Long,staff. When the star guest had
been formally ushered in by the past-presi-
dent and Mrs. Douglas Richardson, the box
was opened up with a musical programme
provided by the Fritz Harts’ brightest stu-
dents. Gertrude Healey fiddled alluringly,
and several of the Con.’s sweetest songbirds
warbled. Little Constance Burt, who looks
as if she had strayed out of a picture of a
Court lady of Marie Antoinette’s day, was
especially in the picture. Longstaff, who had
nothing in particular to say and found it
difficult to utter, thanked them all for being
there. And then there was jazz.
The appeal launched by Lady Stradbroke
for funds for an up-to-date home for the
District Nursing Society resulted in a hand-
some £21,000 being raised. The Society does
splendid work in nursing the sick poor in
their own homes, and when the new building
is completed will be able to supplement this
by taking in cases which cannot be provided
for otherwise.
A big gathering of the best-known crowded
the Fine Arts Galleries for the unveiling of
Mary Allen’s show of paintings. Persian rugs
and bowls of flowers helped the pictures to
furnish the room. Dr. MacFarland, who spoke
the opening words, referred to the English
critics’ disappointment in finding Australian
art as seen at Wembley no different from
the art of other lands —apparently they ex-
pected aboriginal rock-carvings or something
of the sort. In time, observed the knight,
we may go as far in art as we have in sport,
but at present we will do well to follow
ancient tradition—which, of course, takes us
back to the rock-carvings again. Little red
tabs spotted dozens of the smaller works
almost as soon as the doors flew open.
Nice, remarks circulated over the glasses
in the Board Room of the Athenaeum when
a press-view of the new theatre which has
risen, from the ashes of its decayed- old pre-
decessor was held last week. The Athenaeum
stands as a monument of Melbourne’s early
pursuit of the amenities. When the city was in
its swaddling clothes in 1839 the Mechanics’
Institute was formed to develop the infant
community’s cultural side. The Institute be-
came the Athenaeum in the early ’seventies,
but by and bye settled down to decay. Three
officials held office for 40 years mainly be-
cause nobody had the energy to push them
out, and they spent their time mostly in
fighting one another—the janitor bought
scrubbing-brushes only as weapons of offence.
When the present secretary took charge there
were only 300 members; but the place is now’
booming, and one of the conditions under
wdiich E. J. Carroll secured the right to con-
struct the theatre out of the old concert hall
was the remodelling of portion of the old,
old buildings. Two of the trees in Collins-
street’s avenue had to go to make room for
an awning in front of the hall —a big fight
was made to block that act of vandalism —
but the theatre, which has seats for 1100 and
is meant for the staging of intimate plays,
is otherwise a benefit to the city.
The Norman Tiernans’ flower-decked
drawing-room sheltered the marriage cere-
mony of their daughter Norma with young
Stanley Coleman last week. After the two
had been made one the party switched over
to the Malvern kiosk for the jollo. The bridal
frock of brocade, with its pink-lined satin
train, was misted with a veil of old Brussels,
lent by Mrs. C. Dodds; this was secured by
a coronet of mixed pearls and orange blos-
soms. Sisters Olga and Tasma, in flowery
georgette straight-jacketed with silver, at-
tended the bride ; A. T. Ellis best-manned the
’groom. Mrs. Tiernan stood in a coal-black
glitter of jet and sequins.
There was a full house at the Vic. Artists’
Galleries the other day when Alliance Fran-
gaise members met to welcome the French
students who are circling the world and
arrived aboard the Ville de Strasbourg.
Consul Turck voiced the welcome, after
which the evening hopped off gaily with a
modern comedy, presented with almost pro-
fessional finish, by Mdlle. Matise, Madame de
Mole, Madame Thomas and Mon. Martel. A
couple of songs from Lilian Gay preluded a
jazzling finale. The party has now passed
on to New Caledonia via Sydney.
Adeline Scott and Tom Carlyon, junior,
snapped their fingers at superstition with a
Friday wedding on Dec. 5 at St. Kilda
Christ Church. The pretty bride, who was
handed over by her dad, was frocked with
costly simplicity in white-beaded georgette,
back-trained with satin, under a Limerick
lace veil moored with orange blossoms. As
matron of honor the ’groom’s sister, Isabel
Scott, contributed a further note of austere
oxpensiveness in white georgette, specked
over with beaded posies. Brother Norman
looked after the ’groom. Tom Carlyon the
elder and his wife uncorked the health-
drinking fizz in the big St. Kilda dance-hall.
Mrs. Tom shook hands in a smart fur-
trimmed coat of Oriental pattern cobwebbed
with gold, and held a flame-colored bouquet,
while a second flame flickered on her hat.
A big bunch of young Tom’s old Geelong
Grammar pals epilogued the speeches by
brightly warbling a little ditty about taking
Mollie to the Fairies; and when Carlyons’
orchestra, which had been interluding the
conversation, broke into a lilting fox-trot, the
tables were pushed back to make way for a
jazz. A Scott aunt sat at the head table
with the bride’s father, Carlyon perc, and
Ins wife. Lower down one sighted the
Charlie Wenman pair, who were specially
interested in the bride. Addie—she had flut-
tered briefly in the J.C.W. limelight.
Thirty-one members of the staff of the
Sydney Water Supply and Sewerage Board,
who tripped to this city the other day, got
a ding-dong welcome from the officers of the
Board of Works. Included in the pro-
gramme was an official how-d’you-do at the
Board’s head office, followed by an inspection
ot Flcmington racecourse and a night out
at the Tivoli. Tuesday and Wednesday were
filled in with bowls, cricket and tennis com-
petitions, in which the Sydneysiders secured
the bowls laurels. On Wednesday evening
the cloth was spread at Carlyons’; and there
were motor trips on Thursday and Friday.
Mrs. Thcyre Weigall’s delightful chats at
the piano have coaxed nobody knows how
much coin out of the public pocket into the
charity money-boxes. The notion came to
her during the
war years, and
British and
French Red
Cross funds
benefited. A n
intimate little
talk on Bough-
ton’s new
opera, “The
Immortal
Hour,” which
may be staged
here next year,
wiped £77 off
the Kindergar-
ten building
debt the other
day. and the
Arts and
Crafts have
asked her to
do it over
again for their
benefit in the
coming autumn. The lady, who is the wife
of Acting-Justice Weigall, was a daughter of
a former Tasmanian Governor, Sir Robert
Hamilton, and has a trio of talented child-
ren. One daughter is pursuing political
economy or something of the sort in
haunts abroad; another is the clever little
artist Joan Lindsay; the only son trudges
the Inky Way on a leading London journal.
Malcolm McDonald, second son of the
Donald McDonalds of Kilmuir station,
Coleraine, claimed Hilarv Reynolds Lewis
at Christ Church, South Yarra. Arthur
Boyes, an old friend of the family, led the
bride to the trvsting-place. Her bridal satin
had a side mooring of old pearls, an heirloom
in her mother’s family. This had a spreading
train, shimmered over with silver lace, while
orange-blossoms anchored the bridal veil to
her Titian locks. The Teddy Dysons’ dark-
eyed chick, June, in pink silk and black lace
bonnet, held up the train. Reg Milner,
assisted by Murray Milner and Reg Lewis,
was in charge of the ’groom; while the bride-
groom’s sister Margaret and the bride’s twin
sisters, Valerie and Valmai, ’maided in sea-
green silk with filmy black hats thatching
their heads.
Mrs. John Jones, here pictured by Lafay-
ette, is the latest feminine recruit to the
swelling ranks of Parliamentary candidates.
As head of a Women’s Training College in
England, she
learned how to
sow seeds in
the fallow
minds of
young ladies.
As a mission-
ary with her
husband, now
vicar of All
Saints’, St.
Kil d a, she
taught the
heathen of
New Guinea
the way he
should go. As
non-party can-
did a t e for
George Fair-
bairn’s old con ■
stituency,
Fawkner, now
represented by
blind barrister
Maxwell, she is going to nse her previous
experience in the forthcoming Federal elec-
tion scrimmage to show the voter, who is
a combination of simple savage and un-
sophisticated maiden, how he or she should
vote. The Victorian Women’s Citizen League,
of which she is president, has instigated the
performance.
Consul-General Segaert has been touring
Tasmania with a portfolio of pictures of Bel-
gian beauty spots and industries. Fortified
by these he lectured the Royal Society, and
every decoration in Hobart turned out —it was
almost the gayest night the city has known
between Governors. The visitor has been
busy keeping step with the rapid social pace
of the island. The Tom Murdochs (he’s local
Belgian Consul) held a reception at Hadley's
to give the lions and lionesses a chance to
air their memories of Europe. Hobart’s
Mayor and Mayoress, the Speaker of the
House and Mrs. Evans, the Manager for
Railways, the Collector of Customs and the
whole box of bigwigs were there, inclusive of
Mrs. John Adams, very grand in her Belgian
decoration, the medal of Queen Elizabeth.
Mrs. Murdoch, too, owns one of these gauds
and duly displayed it.
Admiral Creswell and his Dame, who took
daughter Noel to Africa a couple of months
back, made the sacrifice to James Vigne, the
younger, of Kimberley, at the local cathedral.
The vivacious little bride breathed her vows
in ivory brocade, which deepened to primrose
in the pointed train lining. Orange blossoms
were scattered over the train, more blossoms
moored the bridal veil of tulle, inset with
Carrickmacross lace, and she held bunched
Madonna lilies. Patsy Vigne, who ’maided
the bride on her lonely own, billowed in
primrose georgette glittering with opalescent
beads, and a tulle veil fluttered from her head
to a band of green leaves. Russell Elliott
guarded the ’groom. The Creswell pair had
beckoned 250 guests to the after-sliivoo.
Old-time pressmen heaved a sigh when
they read of the death, at the early age of
20, of the only son of the late Tom
Monaghan. Although Tom himself crossed
the Divide some years ago, his good fellow-
ship and, above all, his inimitable yarn-
spinning in the days when he drove a quill
for the Herald are still remembered by old
colleagues. A niece, Rachel Robinson, be-
longed to the press gang, too, till she took up
the secretaryship of the Housewives’ Asso-
ciation.
The widow of late Police Commissioner
Steward handed her friends and acquaint-
ances a surprise-packet the other day with
her confession of intending matrimony with
an ex-Bush Brother, the Rev. Norley Weeks.
He landed here from England five years ago
to join the Brotherhood in the North, and
now his term of service has run out. Their
vows will be made at St. Mary’s Mission, in
Fitzroy, on December 22.
The Forbes Robertsons’ eldest daughter,
Maxine —she is known as Blossom to her
intimates —stepped into the near-peerage the
other day as the wife of the Hon. Inigo Free-
man Thomas, son and heir of Lord Willing-
don. The wedding was an affair of frill. The
bride, wl.o is a youthful edition of her beaut.i-
ful aunt Maxine, trailed draperies of palest
pink, curtained with antique Venetian point.
Ten frocks of pink georgette, and ten pink
roses nodding from ten hatbrims, marched
her to the sacrifice. The health-drinking was
at the newly-weds’ prospective London home,
St. John’s Lodge, a little wedding gift from
Auntie Maxine. The bride is a talented
artist, and was already beginning to be known
as a book illustrator when Inigo persuaded
her to forsake a mere career to make him
happy. Melbourne knew the bridegroom as
a boy, when his dad gent.-helped on the staff
of his father-in-law 7 , Lord Brassey.
The vice-regal Forsters’ son-in-law, Cap-
tain Pitt Rivers, left by the Tahiti for Lon-
don via the U.S.A. Urgent private affairs
called him across-seas so hurriedly that he
hadn’t time even to finish his Black-Brother
controversy w 7 itli the missionaries.
General John Gellibrand’s elder girl. Joan,
w 7 as made one with her Ceylon Civil Service
fiance, William Battersliill, in London, on
October 21. An uncle, Commander Gelli-
brand, led his niece to the meeting place, and
Mrs. Norman Bayles’s fair-haired flapper
daughter was attendant maid. The cake was
cut in the home of the bride’s godmother, Mrs.
Coustal, in Drayton Gardens. The groom’s
furlough ends early in the new year, when
he will take his wife back with him to his
Spicy Island bungalow.
John Fleming, who has reached three score
and ten winters, not only captained the
family team, representing three generations,
w T hicl> played against 11 picked from Cad-
burys’ factory at Hobart last week, but
carried off the honors by obtaining the best
average as a bowler, taking three wickets
for seven runs. Altogether there were 53
members of the Fleming clan on the ground
prepared to back their captain, who lost the
game by only five runs.
Popular L. A. Adamson, known to every
public-school boy in Victoria as “Dicky,” has
signed on for another five years as head of
Wesley College, where he has been in com-
mand for the past 23 years. A born teacher,
he follows the calling for the sheer love of
training boys in the best traditions of Eng-
lish public-school life. He has ample private
means, and is a bencher of the Middle
Temple.
Adelaide’s N.B.:—
The S. J. Jacobses presided over lunch and tea
(he is tiie club’s acting president) at the Amateur
.Meeting at Cheltenham —she in black and white,
with committeemen’s wives for her luncheon guests
and with a vast concourse of racegoers and their
feminine belongings to tea. Summer came in with
a rush that carried the shade temperature gaily
over the century, and for the first time this season
woman donned her summer fripperies without risking
the penalty of blue nose and chattering teeth.
Friday saw the opening of the Garden Palais —
a floating platform moored to the banks of the
Torrens. Proceeds for the evening w T ere earmarked
for the Adelaide Hospital Auxiliary, and the Moulden
dame, who is the leading spirit in that charitable
enterprise, said the necessary opening word in pink
taffeta and soft georgette, with a comb of carved
tortoiseshell topping her hair. Most of the younger
dancing set were there —smart as paint to begin with
but slightly ruffled by the southerly gale that blew
up before the dancing had even time to get well
under way.
Our latest Elder Scholar (for piano) is Peggy
Ridings, a 12-year-old daughter of the Mrs. Smedley
Palmer who is still best known to music-lovers as
Ethel Ridings. Her grandmother is responsible for
a share of her talent, too! As a slip of a girl
she sang at the concert that marked the first public
using of the organ at the Town Hall.
Miss Iv. A 7. Stimson, who was matron of the
Wentworth District Hospital, was recently appointed
matron of the Industrial School, Edwardstown. She
went off with the A.I.F. during the war. When in
India she was matron at a hospital at Colaba, and
one of her patients was Captain E. W. Ballantine, the
journalist who is now in Australia writing up the
English cricketers. Ballantine was down with
cholera. The other day he called on Matron Stimson
and thanked her for the wonderful attention which
saved his life.
The Caledonian Society, at its annual St. Andrew's
Day combination of haggis, heather and bagpipes,
announced that it is about to build a Caledonian
Hall in Adelaide. The land, in King William-street
South, has already been secured. The Society claims
as its other monuments the Burns statue on North-
terrace and the McDouall Stuart statue in Victoria-
square ; the latter it “took in hand and completed
after other efforts had failed.”
The lonely property occupied long ago by C. C.
Kingston, close to the shore beyond Brighton, has
just been sold in several hundred allotments, seaside
suburban settlement having overtaken it. A few
acres have been kept as a public reserve, including
the two pine-trees on the beach which are a land-
mark for miles around.
Adelaide has selected, out of 15 designs sent in
for a Ross Smith Memorial, one by F. B. Hitch, of
London. It is a bronze statue of the airman in his
flying costume, standing on a segment of the globe.
The pedestal will be of Australian marble, 16 feet
high, with bronze figures of Flight, and Intrepidity,
and scenes from the historic world-flight shown in
relief. The whole is to cost £5OOO, and to stand
in Creswell Gardens, outside the Adelaide Oval. A
second prize of £lOO was awarded to the design of
P. R. Montford, the Victorian, who is now back
in Australia after years of successful work in Europe.

The Mystery and the Mastery

unsolved mysteries of matter —
the “Lafaye” Pearl is the

origin of the Oriental specimen

origin of the “Lafaye” speci-
men is established. The deep-

“Lafaye” creation differs only
in composition, but otherwise
is as perfect a pearl as was ever
born in a bivalve.

"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKE
When the conditions suit him, Mirthmaker
is a pretty good horse. They suited him in the
£6OO Warwick Handicap at Randwiek on Saturday,
for rain had softened the going to his liking, and he
was better off for condition than most of the other
starters. Supported from 6’s to 7 to 2, he was
well back at the entrance to the straight, but
finished at a rare bat for - little Garrard, and got
up in time to beat Irish Flower by a head, with
Houdini another length or so away and Ludden-
ham, the second favorite, fourth. Mirthmaker carried
Bst. 41b. —41b. more than his Summer Cup weight
-and ran the 11 furlongs in 2min. 22j$ec. One
of the dozen he defeated was David, who ran
qbitc well for a mile, and there may be a race
or two in the old fellow yet. Two other favorites
to get home were Monopole (9 to 4) and Wallace
Armstrong (3’sf, the latter after a protest against
Confusion, who had dead-heated with him; but few
punters profited by the successes of Tressie (10’s),
Gaelic Maid (B’s) or Poor Joan (12’s) ; and Return,
a Woorak colt in Marsden’s stable, gave McShortodds
a skinner, followers of Marsden’s horses falling
over one another to back Firefly at 2’s and 6 to 4.
Nor did many of the public back Cajole (7 to 2),
a slippery filly by The Welkin—Flowery Speech,
although W. Kelso, the owner-trainer, had a decent
win. There were several Villiers Stakes candidates
in Tressie’s race, and Royal Dighton came from the
clouds to earn third money for his owner and £6
Bs. 6d, for every holder of a 10s. tote ticket on the
good-looking horse. The Villiers may be a bit
beyond this fellow, but a decent handicap should
come his way presently.
“Adelaide”: At
the last meeting of the
Amateur Turf Club, on
the Port " Adelaide
course, it would have
paid handsomely to
plank a note blindfold
on every nag that went
to the post. Number
of starters, ill; total
dividends (including a
£3l Bs., a £53 3s„
and a £37 125.),
£172 Is. Nothing like
like that ever happens
where McShortodds has
a monopoly.
P. L. GARDINER,
owner of a good
Adelaide string.
The withdrawal of the bottled-up An-
tanan and Shanky took most of the interest out
i the handicap at Moonee Valley (Vic.) on Satur-
* V " urc *' (7 to 4), who is only a down-the-liner
~ test, came home six lengths in front of two
other moderates, Deacon and Creeper. H. Stubblety,
™° is that rare bird a good-looking apprentice,
rode IVurdi, and the preceding winner, Brief, as
veil. Erie Connolly gave Poetaster a gallop in the
two-year-old handicap, and, with Dempsey atop, the
Absurd filly was heartily backed at s’s. As often
rappeiM with a Connolly first-up, she jumped away
well and had things all her own way in the straight.
“Chiron”; Holt, the Mordialloc trainer, is having
1 great time with King Pan. After winning three
good races during the Spring carnival, the Shepherd
t I~ Sweet Honey gelding succeeded in a handicap
a Mentone, and within 12 days placed the Bendigo
and Ballarat Cups to his and owner W. McCulloch’s
credit. He was four lengths ahead of Gungool at
:r e finish of the Ballarat race; and, considering that
; mare ran a good second to Lilypond in the
notham Handicap—Back.wood was among the beaten
wises the form was good- King Pan will be a
“ a ?ot Handicap fancy if produced for that race,
,and the Australian Cup may not be beyond him.
“Country Ped”: During the last three
years numerous country racing clubs in Victoria —
the so-called unregistered clubs—have formed district
associations in order to clean up the sport. Each
association has rules ordering the registration of
owners, trainers, horses and jockeys, and has ap-
pointed officials, including stipendiary stewards, a
handicapper, a judge in some instances, and a pony
measurer. For some unfathomable reason, the Vic.
Trotting and Racing Association last year framed
a rule • stating that if a trot were held at any
such meeting, ponies, trotters and riders would be
ineligible at Ascot and Richmond. So perforce the
“pfermit” clubs cut out the trots. The country
associations have now become fairly strong bodies,
and recently they asked the V.T.R.A. to rescind the
rule. Instead, a newly-made regulation was hurled
at their heads —all “permit” clubs must pay 265. a
year to the V.T.R.A., and hand over all their
registration fees received from owners, trainers and
jockeys, otherwise no horse, pony or rider on these
courses would be allowed to compete on any
V.T.R.A. course. The proceeds of “permit” races
are generally given to some public institution or
charity, which is more than can be said of Wren’s
affairs. What is the Chief Sec. doing when he allows
Wren’s crowd to jump on country sport in this
fashion ?
* * * *
“Hamer”: Driving at the Richmond (Vic.)
trots, at the age of 75, is Silas Beebe, who arrived
in Australia 16 years ago with Linus, subsequently
an attraction at Bostock’s Circus. Linus had a tail
16 feet long and a mane which fell L 3 feet on each
side of its neck. When the horse had exhausted
this continent, Beebe took it to England and
sold it; but Australia called him again, and he
went into the trotting business. Then the astonishing
ancient got married, and he is now the father of
two children.
* * * *
The long-distance flight from Pimba(S.A.)
to Melbourne, over an airline of 660 miles, was won
by a pigeon belonging to W. Evans, of Hawthorn ;
it arrived home 25 hours and 10 minutes after liber-
ation. A bird nominated by G. Adams, of Coburg,
reached its loft six minutes later. Homers, like
waterside workers, knock off at night, and, deducting
10 hours on that account, the winner’s flying
time was approximately 15 1-6 hours, which is claimed
to be a world’s record for the distance.
* * * *
The few people who didn’t stay away from
the Melbourne Stadium last Saturday night came to
cheer and remained to pray for the finish. The
heavy-fisted Ernie Rice (lOst. 4^lb.) scored points
over the still agile though ancient Harry Stone
(lOst. lAlb.), mainly because that master of ring-
craft used it all in eluding the Englishman’s ponder-
ous punches. Tiring after the tenth, Stone took a
lot of punishment in a cheerful spirit, but it was a
relief to him when the end came and the referee
crowned Rice. There was nothing inspiring about
the fray, which was on the lines of a mere Satur-
day-night formality.
Displaying a bit more aggressiveness than
is his habit, Grime, the N. S. Wales tedder, knocked
skin and hair off Ansel Bell in the Sydney Stadium
ring, and was rewarded with the decision and 25 p.c.
of a middling purse. Bell is an American negro and
was wildly overboomed. Another member of his
race is reported to be coming from the U.S.A. to
the order of Stadiums, Ltd. Presumably negroes
can be hired cheaper than representative pale-face
pugs., and the White Australia policy doesn’t seem
to matter where Wren, the Friend of the Masses, is
concerned.
* * * *
“Ziff”: The Chinese boxer mentioned by
“A.A.” (B. 13/11/’24) couldn’t have spent much
time at that Burnie (Tas.) Invndrv. I met him a
month or two before at Moonta (S.A.) Show,
and what is left of the Cousin Jacks there jostled
each other to get inside the tpnt when he “put ’em
up.” He has also been heard of at Mt. Gambler
and other S.A. towns. The Chink acts better than
he boxes; in fact, if Asche is short of an under-
study next time he puts cn “Chu Chin Chow” he
could do a lot worse than engage Tommy Lee.
* * * *
The All Blocks won their 22nd game
against the Llanelly XVI (so called because iis op-
ponents usually have to play 15 men in jerseys and
one with a whistle) by B—3 after the saucepan-
makers had lived up to their old renown for dealing
out the all-in stuff. Llanelly was the first British
club to stop the Wallabies, and also defeated the
M.L. Native team, 3 —-0. in 1888-89, though it did
not meet the first All Blacks. The tourists’ week-
end game was a runaway win by 31 to 7 against East
Midlands, at Northampton, where the boot-mechanics
turned out to the tune of a 20,000 crowd. The
All Blacks’ score now stands 635 to 71.
“A.H.”: Recent pars contrasting the doings and
scores of the All Blacks in the U.K. with those of
their predecessors in 1905-06, and in 1889, have
a touch of amari alicjuid when you’ve left youth so
far behind. But it was this that rubbed it in:—
“Louden, Dec. 1. —Ten survivors of the Llanelly
XV which defeated the Maori team of 1888 will act
as ground and stand stewards to-morrow.”
The inference is unescapable that 66 per cent, would
about represent the proportion of survivors of the
first M.L. team’s opponents on British football
grounds. I’m cne of them, anyhow, but with none
of the glowing memories that sustain the Llanelly
veterans. I played against them at Wellington,
Somerset; the county’s surprise, also that of the
players, at being severely walloped, though the
invaders had hardly got into their stride then, was
considerable. Nevertheless, although quite good
enough to give the counties and the clubs a series
of shocks, they w T ere outplayed by England. I
saw the international match at Blackheath in Febru-
ary ; A. E. Stoddart, then in the prime of his
athletic powers, captained the home side, to the
best of my recollection, and England won by a goal
and 4 tries to love. Still, even the 1889 AH Blacks
taught British footballers a lot in behind-the-scrum
possibilities, and their successors have continued the
process. Wales isn’t what it was then in Rugby
football—the rival code has obtained two big a hold
—and, as Scotland refuses to play the tourists, it
looks as if the only side with a chance of checking
their career of glory is the full strength of England.
I would give something to be at Twickenham on
January 3.
“H. Hardupp”: In his reference to the first Maori
team to visit England “Te Pana” (B. 27/11/’24)
goes back to the year one of international football.
W. Warbrick was not a full-blooded Henare: there
were several Warbricks in the team and they varied
in hue, although half-brothers. One might have
been taken for a pure white; but “Smiler” was
darker than the average Maori. The tourists’ arrival
in England was a godsend to the comic papers.
Ally Sloper came out with a double page in which
the Maoris were pictured with bones through their
noses and ears and rings on their limbs; and the
game was represented as having been halted owing
to a dusky toenail having burst the ball. Mean-
time some of the visitors were stewing the referee,
and others hanging round the pot. waiting to eat
him. And that is not 36 years ago!
* * * *
“Machete”: Barefooted football was not
confined to the Maoris (B. 27/11/’24). Years ago,
before the wearing of boots was made compulsory,
a good many whites preferred to play in bare
feet, especially among the juniors. I recall particu-
larly the brothers Crouch, fishermen all, who bogged
in for Bulimba (Q.) and drop-kicked as effectively
EAST, WEST, HOME’S BEST.
“Come and have a round, Brown.”
“No thanks, old man. Prefer to do my
digging here.”
with their bare toes as with boots. They, of course,
spent most of their working hours seining in Moreton
Bay, without any sole leather save that furnished by
nature, and sharp shells or broken bottles gave them
little pause. A North Queensland three-quarter named
.Smyth, who used to play with Townsville against
the Towers, always went on the field in tennis shoes,
but shed them as soon as things got warm. Many
famous inter-State players stuck to light sandshoes
till boots were made compulsory, Billy Warbrick
and his brother Fred, both fine kicks, being of the
number. Because, probably, of their hard, dry
grounds, Queensland players, particularly, affected
these light shoes.
* * * *
Despite another heavy track, policeman
George Parker made new N.S.W. records in winning
the three-mile walk at the Dunn Shield competition
on Sydney Uni. Oval. He plugged past the mile in
6min. 40 2-ssec., two miles in 14min. 3 l-ssec.,
anl three miles in 21min. lflsee. ; and if he goes
on improving at this rate he will be a match for
anyone in the world before long. Another John Hop
in W. F. Payne won the javelin throw (166 ft.
4Ain.) and the 161 b. shot putt (38ft. 11 jin.) ; and
Tom McNamara also collected two trophies for the
100yds. (llsee.) and the 440yds. (51 4-ssec.). It is
a long time since there was a slower “hundred,” but
the weather was chiefly responsible.
* * * *
“Past Grammar” : So much opposition was
shown in N. S. Wales Assembly to a bill enabling
the trustees of Sydney Cricket Ground to raise money
by mortgage for stands on the famous “hill” that the
Government withdrew the measure. Replying to a ques-
tion put by Connell, M.L.A. for Newcastle, the Minister
of Lands said that he would ask the trustees to
consult with the Rugby League as to whether this
professional football organisation could not “come to
some understanding with other clubs,” i.e., amateur
bodies. It is amazing that a Minister of the Crown
should have to acknowledge in Parliament that he
was helpless to placate the critics of the bill unless he
could induce a professional crowd with pony-racing
associations to loosen its grip on the ground, of
which it has been granted a winter monopoly till
1930. The ground is supposed to belong to the
people, too.
Thanks to the plucky second-innings efforts
of L. O’Connor (66 nlo.) and R. H. Oxenham (45
n. 0.), Queensland managed to make a draw of its
game against the Englishmen. The same two Banana-
landers figured prominently in the match between
an Australian XI, representative of all the States
except Tasmania, and Gilligan’s men: O’Connor
kept wickets excellently and made 50 and 40,
Oxenham's contributions being 54 and 4 for 25.
But the Australian XI selectors were not present,
the idea evidently being that none but southerners
need apply. The Australians batted first and methodi-
cally compiled 526 in two days, the principal run-
getters, besides those mentioned, being Thompson
(114), Taafe, the Westralian (86 n. 0.), Ponsford
(81), Hendry (68), and Arthur Richardson (35).
Thompson’s century was the first ever made by a
Queenslander against the Englishmen, and, with
Taafe, who learned his cricket in London, he put
on 170 for the seventh wicket. Freeman (6 for 153)
was the least unsuccessful bowler; Tyldesley and
Howell were both costly, and the side palpably
missed Gilligan and Tate. England replied with 421,
Hendren coming to light with another 100 and
Chapman contributing 92 in 102 minutes. As in
the arguments with Queensland and N. S. Wales,
the left-hander’s batting was the most brilliant of the
match. Douglas (54) and Kilner (52) also made
runs when the need was urgent. Grimmett got
four wickets, like Oxenham, but 176 runs were hit
off his slows. The Australians’ second innings
(they lost five wickets for 257) was more or less
of a joke, Douglas trying 11 trundlers, and Free-
man stumping Oxenham off Strudwick’s bowling.
However, it enabled Richardson and Kippax to
appeal to the missing selectors with 83 and 82 n. 0.,
respectively.
“Wink”: It is the hope of every Victorian that
W. M. Woodfull will be included in one of the Test
teams, for it is felt that if he gets a chance he will
play himself into a permanency. Woodfull was first
heard of in 1919-20, when, with the Maryborough
Public Service, he averaged 94. Next season, in
ll innings, his hands included three centuries and
four times into the eighties; average, 195. He also
got 51 for Ballarat against Douglas’s Englishmen.
The youngster’s bush career terminated in 1922,
when, after scoring 63, 174 n. 0., 149 n. 0., and 96
n.o. (average 482) for his old team, he was given
a game against the South Oss colts. He got 169
n. 0., and followed that with 227 n.o. against the
N. S. Wales Second XI. Then he came to town, and,
made a Vic. representative, proved his class by
heading the Shield aggregates: 514, average 85.
Last season he fell away a little in trying to acquire
new strokes, but managed to amass for Vic. 254
runs, average 36. This year he got into his best
form by steady practice throughout the winter, and
though not a brilliant or a hurricane bat, he is
just the man to keep an end while the Richardsons
and the Kippaxes provide the fireworks. He possesses
the Test-match temperament and is safe and hard-
working in any part of the field.
“H. Hardupp” : There is a Young Chinese
team playing third-grade cricket in Melbourne.
Three of the members studied at Scotch College—
a favorite academy with wealthy Melbourne Celestials
—and one, Gordon Lum, represented the college at
cricket, football and tennis; incidentally, lie won
the singles in the Church of England competition
last year. Another member, L. Kewming, served
with the A.I.F. in France.
***■*•
“Past Grammar”: Vie. Richardson, who
made 106 arid 123 for South 'Aus. against N.S.W.,
is the fifteenth Australian to score a century in
each innings of a first-class match. C. J. Eady, the
big Tasmanian, was the first of them, scoring 106
and 112 n.«. against Victoria in 1894-95. Of the
others, only C. G. Macartney has done the trick
twice—against S’Africa in Sydney in 1910-11 and
against Sussex in 1912. Warren Bardsley is the,
only Australian to catch the double in a Test match.
The number of English players who have reached
the two centuries of late years is now close on a
hundred. Yet, within the memory of many of ns,
W. G. Grace was alone in his solitary magnificence
as the scorer of two separate hundreds in a match.
Then A. E. Stoddart came along and was followed
apace by others. It is the modern wicket that is
to blame, probably, for no one would care to say
the batting is of a higher standard to-day than it
was a generation ago, or that our bowlers are de-
generating, while the number of first-class cricketers
playing is probably no greater than it was then.
Given a bit of luck, I hope to see the scoring of
two separate two hundreds, and our Test match
conditions make this possible. Warwick Armstrong
nearly did it in 1920 with 157 n.o. and 245
against S.A.
* * * *
“Hambledon” : I note that the vocabulary
of the cricket reporter has been enlarged to the
extent of one or two quite new expressions. The
mot juste for smart and well-judged running between
the wickets, at which Hobbs and others excel, is
“judgmatic,” a word which my dictionary refers to
rather disparagingly as colloquial but which seems
to meet some previously felt want in cricket chro-
nicling. More puzzling is the adjective “hostile,”
with or without intensives, as applied to certain
bowlers or forms of bowling. Surely all bowling is
inimical. No, perhaps not quite all; I once saw
“W.G.” pitch up a full toss to leg so that a colt
who had made 99 in a county match, and was becom-
ing painfully nervous, could" get his century, and I
suspect that the first two balls Hailey bowled to
Clem Hill in the recent Howell benefit match were
meant to be hit. Also, it is obvious that a bowler
whose captain desired the other side to avert a
follow-on might eliminate hostility from his deliveries.
But these are unimportant exceptions to the rule
that in a normal game, as some poet has phrased
it, “Though the man with the bat is a fellow, the
man with the ball is a foe.” Some better word than
hostile might be employed to denote that one
trundler is showing more bite than another.
* * * *
“FY7”: This discussion on the M.C.C.’s
ruling as to changing the grip from right hand to
left when batting reminds the writer of the late
Jimmy Cowan, master for many years at Brisbane
“Grammar,” and a Queensland cricket rep. in the
long ago. Jimmy was a terrific hitter, either right- or
left-handed, an excellent slow bowler with either
paw, and a perfect fieldsman who could return with
either right or left. I never heard of his doing it
in big cricket, but in minor matches James delighted
to mix his batting and bowling, right or left, as
seemed best to him.
* * * *
Motorists who have lately established new
records in two directions across the continent found
wet their worst handicap in the alleged “dry heart”
of Australia. Birtles, who undertook to drive from
Darwin to Adelaide in 10 days, and finished nearly
15 hours under his time limit, was held up by
running creeks and boggy patches; and the West-
ralians G. Ford and C. Watson, who ran a motor-
cycle with sidecar from Perth to Sydney in 9 days
15 hours 49min. (2£ hours under the previous
record), had their progress impeded by heavy rain
in the region where there is a vague idea that
drought is perpetual.
The horizon of the Australian sports-
woman is almost as wide as her brother’s, and The
Bulletin's flapper daughter, the Mirror, caters for
her as well as for her more domesticated sister.
Next week’s issue (the extraordinary threepenn’orth
is published every Tuesday) will contain an instruc-
tive article on Women’s Hockey.
THE RULING PASSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Five miners entombed in a Swansea colliery
comforted themselves in the pitchy darkness by
singing hymns and discussing the chances of Wales
beating the All Blacks at football. Their first
question when rescued was how the match had gone.”
“Lead Thou Me On” we chanted all together,
Praying to emerge from our dark prison alive;
Followed consid’rable conjecture whether
Kick-off would land the whirling, whizzing leather
In Wales’s or New Zealand’s twenty-five.
No real misdoubts we felt about our backs,
But would we hold the Blackies in the packs?
“0 God our Help” we sang, with no reporters,
Nor even an accordion to strum;
Reviewed the merits of the wing three-quarters,
Agreed that Jones, and Griffith, too, were snorters
And Morgan lightning-quick behind the scrum;
But wondered would the Taffy forwards show
The team-work that distinguishes the foe.
Two days, three nights, in bleak and black dejection,
We made our cage resound with hymns galore,
And when exhausted was the whole collection
We bent our faculties in the direction
Of prophesying what would be the score.
“Nineteen to nil!” Oh, what a tale of woe!
The gloom seems thicker here than down below.

extent controls Federal and State Liberalism
(such as it is) in Vic. Fairbairn had to
throw up the job when he became Agent-
General. Mcßeath, besides running a big
business of his own in Flinders-lane, is chair-
man of the State Savings Bank Commission-
ers and a factor in other things.
“Verri”: A coincidence connected with the
retirement of Bishop Julius, of Christ-
church (M.L.), after 34 years of service,
is that the flat city’s only other bishop,
Harper, also reigned for 34 years. While
Julius and his archdeacon son will be long
remembered for their good works, it is an-
other son whose performances will more
surely go down to posterity. When bishops
and archdeacons are forgotten the Julius
totalisator will still be going strong in the
land.
In his 40 years of service with the Union
Co. Captain J. T. Rolls, who has just hauled
down his flag on the Niagara, has seen
the Red Funnel grow from its modest Dun-
edin beginning into the powerful Inchcape
limb it now is. His grand-dad, after retiring
from the East India Co., came to Australia
in command of the ship Rhoda, which carried
the first Victorian wool clip to London in the
’thirties. The shipment was taken from
Melbourne in the Thistle to Launceston,
where it was hoisted into the hold of the
Rhoda. The old chap returned to Australia
and settled in Melbouime. His son, father
of J.T., was well known in Victoria in the
’sixties as a shipowner and captain.
There is at least one man still living in
N. S. Wales who was shot at and wounded
by the bushrangers of the gold-digging days.
He is Walter William Millitt, the oldest
inhabitant of Leadville, on the Coolahburra-
gundy River (N.S.W.), where the grass-
hoppers are bad, is 97, and resides with his
son, the proprietor of the Royal Hotel. The
General Hewit, a 961-ton East Indiaman,
brought young Millitt to Sydney in 184 S,
and he was hardly ashore before he
was arrested by a constable who mistook him
for an escaped convict. From Sydney he
travelled to Bathurst by bullock-team, and
was on the Ophir three days after gold was
struck. In 1861 he became a gold-buyer for
the Bank of N. S. Wales at Bathurst, and
for several years was on the Turon diggings.
It was in 3865 that he was pursued and
wounded by bushrangers while he was riding
along the Sydney-road carrying £4OO in his
saddlebag. He escaped, arriving in an ex-
hausted state at Bathurst, where Dr. Mac-
hattie extracted 18 pellets of buckshot from
his back without the use of an anaesthetic.
“The Dip” recalls some friends: —
I knew John Thomas Christie, alias William Max-
well Maxted, shot by a warder recently when escaping
from the Mt. Eden (M.L.) Gaol, and whilst I admired
his talents I can’t say I liked him. He may not
have been a “shelf,” but he was unscrupulous when
it came to his own liberty, and consequently he
never made many friends in Australia’s underworld.
Tom Hardy and Trainor were the only two “tank”
men Christie ever got on with, and they were a
redoubtable trio. Christie had turned housebreaker
when only 15, and he graduated quite early into
the safe-blowing section of his profession, and, pos-
sessing. great mechanical skill, made a success of it.
Hardy and Trainor had a very successful run on
coming to Sydney a couple of years ago, but
eventually fell into a trap. Christie was taken at
once and Hardy was picked up at Durban ; Trainor
was the only one to make a clean’ escape. He’s now
in America. Christie was a born actor. I saw him
on trial a couple of times, and every word and move-
ment was thought-out carefully beforehand. Tiie
manner in which he tricked the M.L. and Victorian
authorities is the best proof of his histrionic ability.
Thrice in M.L. and once in Vic. he feigned madness,
was moved from gaol to an asylum, and then simply
walked off to commence his crib-cracking night-life
again. He gave it a trial in Sydney, but the effort
proved a dismal failure.
O PIONEERS!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Miss Austin was one of the first to have her
hair shingled.”
O Pioneers ! O Pioneers !
The dreadful deed is done;
The plaits have fallen ’neath the shears,
And vanished is the bun;
And down the track your daring clears
Ten thousand women run.
for this shall Fame your names enshrine in her
immortal book
With old Othere and Ithobal, Columbus, yea, and
Cook;
And some fond sister, as she trims her much dimin-
ished wig,
Compare you to the great 80-bo who introduced roast
pig-
How did you feel
When round your warm necks crept the chilly steel?
Like our first parent when upon his sight
Broke all the wonders of mysterious night ?
Or like stout Cortez when with wild surmise
He stared at the new fashion, and his men
His men his men? Most probably they sniggered
And said whatever’s Spanish for “We’re absolutely
jiggered ! r
This, as I think you will allow,
Is getting mixed; but, anyhow,
’Tis to acclaim courageous maids,
I pen this little jingle;
They were the first that ever burst —
No, no! that wore the shingle.

The moral watchdogs who sit at the re-
ceipt of Customs, and save our perishable
souls by stopping all consignments of La
Vie Parisienne from entering this country,
should weep to see how Seymour Hicks has
surmounted their barrier in “Sleeping Part-
ners,” at Sydney Grand Opera House. The
piece is simply a double distillation of the
banned French paper’s pages. Much, how-
ever, may be laid down in fclack and white,
especially when it is done in the elegant
French idiom, which can’t be judiciously
enacted in flesh and blood, even when
the two parties are legal mates off-
stage ; so Hicks bowed to the S. M.
Heraed’s thunder, and his caress on Mon-
day night was a pale image of the exuber-
ant embrace of Saturday. Nevertheless,
his vivacity and speed were eminently suited
to the part of the effervescing lover who has
languished for love of another man’s wife
for 18 months. When finally the timorous
lady comes to spend the evening at his flat
because she suspects her husband to have
gone off on an amorous adventure of his
own, he gives her a sleeping draught in mis-
take for sal volatile, and spends his longed-
for tryst listening to her snores.
* * * *
Ellaline Terriss played the discontented
wife with a quiet grace which was
an effective foil to her lover’s exuberance.
Vivian Edwards, as the husband, was the
usual foolish cuckold of French comedy, and
his beard, which some Sydney critics puzzled
themselves over, was perfectly in place. It
is hard for us to realise that the heroes and
villains of De Balzac and De Maupassant

wore ziffs down to their second shirt-studs,
but so it was—and is. The highly proper
ending to the flippant thing, in which the
lover loses the lady and is left with the
drugged body of the husband on his hands,
is also in accordance with French traditions
of propriety.
* * * *
On the other hand “Scrooge,” the curtain-
raiser founded on Dickens’s story, was not
only immoral in its teaching, but crude and
ineffective in its presentation. The lesson
shown is briefly that an unpleasant old
miser, who has spent his life in making
money and sweating his employees, can be
frightened into a death-bed repentance by
visions of his past misdeeds and threats of
hell-fire punishments to come; and the
author apparently believed that his hero, by
disgorging a modest portion of his wealth
could buy his absolution. In this fragment of
a play Seymour Hicks as Scrooge was out of
place. His delivery was not equal to its
dramatic needs, and his comic face protruded
through Scrooge’s malignant mask with un-
fortunate effect. Austen Milroy, as the gan-
grened ghost of Jacob Marley, looked as if
he had been disinterred after a long sojourn
underground, but his presence on the stage
as the herald of a prolonged series of senti-
mental visions of Bob Cratchit’s domestic
hearth was an absurd convention, impossible
to sustain with realism. The incidental music
by Dora Bright did its best, mainly by means
of the big drum, to create the supernatural
atmosphere.
** * *
A Bulletin man at a new show: —
By Saturday the sky-god had become thoroughly
fed up with the importunate amateur airmen who
had been buzzing aloft for the past week at Rich-
mond (N.S.W.), and in the afternoon he upended a
rain cloud and poured its contents on the field. It
was the 5000 people who had come by train and
motor from Sydney who got the deluge; the aviators
trundled their delicate-winged creatures back into
the hangar at the first sign of storm. A lull in
the tempest brought them all out again like chickens
from under a hen, and when they lined up, tho
little home-made luggers alongside the big overseas
liners, and began pawing the ground for the
start of the Derby, the crowd forgot its dampness
and the cold draught from the south. A fresh
downpour drove the fliers inside again, however, and
the onlookers, clinging to the police barriers, lost
hope. Over a thousand cars simultaneously made up
their minds to go home, and each tried to put its
resolution into effect forthwith. Clarendon and
Windsor never saw a sight like it before. An aviator
who went aloft an hour later reported a string of
struggling automobiles stretching from the ’drome
towards Sydney as far as the eye could reach. It
took the procession an hour to cover the two miles
to Windsor.
Between the cloud-bursts, Flight-Lieut. Brownnell,
in a Defence Department Avro, gave an imitation of
a performing seal in mid air, which suitably took
everybody’s breath away. After risking his life in
14 different ways, all equally graceful, he retired
for a rest to an altitude of 14,000 feet. For the
next stunt a couple of small boys, a six-foot-
eight giant with a megaphone to look after them,
departed to a remote corner of the field and started
■o blow bubbles. That, at any rate, is what they
looked like to this spectator. Captains Follett and
Jones then went aloft in their baby carriages, and
chased and slaughtered the sailing globules in the
most exuberant manner. Any that escaped were
duly massacred by the watchful Brownnell waiting
in the upper strata. The spectacle of the three
machines darting hither and thither like swallows
on an evening full of insects made up for all the
other disappointments of the day.
The thrill of the morning was Captain Follett's
attempt to lower the world’s low-powered reliability
record in a little machine which he wheels in
and out of the hangar like a kid pushing a trike.
An altercation earlier in the week with a horse,
however, spoilt his chances, and he gave up with
90 miles or so to do. About 12 o’clock Captain
Jones roared off into the teeth of a southerly gale
towards Bowral to pick up Governor De Chair; but
after wandering about in mountain mist for an hour
or so he returned without the vice-regal lading.
Sheltering in the hangar during the afternoon was
Defence Minister Bowden. CaDtain Chateau, with a
face like a battle-axe, was there full of enthusiasm,
though he doesn’t fly nowadays. Captain Percival,
who won the reliability and climbing tests, crawled
from under nis engine occasionally to take a breath
of air unmixed with oil, looking happy, heavy-eyed
and haggard. H. G Broadsmith had his crest up-
lifted and an eager smile on his face. Give him
a few yards of Irish linen, some “dope” and a
stick or two of Queensland maple, and he will
make a clockwork bird for you any day in your
own back yard. Wackett and Reid can too. Young
D. Macarthur Onslow swept up most of the prizes
with his little biplane like a silver dragon-fly, built
and designed by Broadsmith.. There were perhaps
a score of men there writing the first chapter of
Australia’s sky history for which the Smiths, Parer,
and Mclntosh wrote the preface—all young, keen and
extraordinarily good-looking. One wondered what
the rest of the thousand or ten thousand that
ought to have been there too, were doing, neglecting
this great new sport for young kings.
* * * *
Seven machines went up on Mcnday in the big
event postponed from Saturday. The Derby and the
Handicap were flown at the same time, so that when
Captain Follett droned off in the big De Havilland
the babies had been humming around the course for
a quarter of an hour or more. Lieut. H. C. Miller
sailed home first in the Handicap, and to celebrate
his victory took a turn round the hangar. Follett,
travelling at nearly two miles a minute in a Defence
Department Avro, won the Derby, but with a Govern-
ment machine could not claim the prize, which goes
to Miller, whose time with a home-built flier was
the fastest. In order to join in the aerial argument,
the young Queenslander made the longest journey of
any of the participants, and his win gained him a
big ovation from the crowd.

Sydney Royal audiences are steadily recon-
structing recent impressions of Italy ; there are
no black shirts to mar the scenery in “Wild-
flower,” and castor-oil isn’t even mentioned.
Instead, there are quite a number of spark-
ling girls, and romance spiced with comedy
and Spanish dances; altogether a much
pleasanter Italy than the one on which Tom
Henley called a few months back to pay
his respects to Mussolini.
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
Van Cello does things to barrels with his feet.
At Sydney Tivoli Maidie Scott, fresh from
Loudon, was enthusiastically voted the goods
on Saturday night. A tuneful sparkler is
Maidie, and “If the Wind Had Only Blown
the Other Way” and “The Bird on Nellie’s
Hat” must have been in a lot of
ears next morning before hymn tunes re-
asserted their sway. Rosie Lloyd is another
packet of feminine attractiveness, who scores
her points not quite so subtly. W. V.
Robertson, the Canadian entertainer, shows
some rare skill in extracting music from the
tiniest mouth-organs, while “General” Ed
La Vine’s juggling feats, the burlesque artis-
try of Laveen and Cross, the “board-beat-
ing” of Williams and Taylor, and Gene Mor-
gan’s dancing are other commendable items
on an excellent bill.
* * * *
Those people who make a habit of dropping
into Sydney Fullers’ once a week are griev-
ing over the departure of Stiffy and Mo, and
an all-vaudeville bill has displaced the half-
revue, half-variety programme that has been
there for so long. Edward and Hughes con-
tribute a brisk sketch, Dan Thomas is a
knowing panto dame; but in the dancing of
Mullaney brothers there is more sweat than
grace.

Leatrice Joy is “The Marriage Cheat” wdio
is giving Sydney Hoyt’s audiences great satis-
faction this week. Leatrice, rather than
cuddle up to her just-acquired husband, takes
a header from a ship, and wakes up on a
South Sea isle where she beguiles an aus-
tere young missionary. The Lyceum’s spread
of screen-fiction includes “Luck,” with
Johnny Hines, and “Cornered,” a drama
lifted from the archives of an American city’s
police department. Viola Dana is stepping
it out at the Globe, and “Montmarte” has
removed itself to the gloomy interior of the
Empress. The Strand is giving a warning
for mothers, “For Your Daughter’s Sake,”
wider circulation. “Fighting Fury,” at the
Haymarket, is a theme that was stale when
Wild West stories were in their infancy, and
Captain Blood and his crew of cut-throats are
at the Crystal Palace. At the Prince Edward
“The Ten Commandments” is still swelling
the bank balance. But there’s been some
dispute over the royalties—some Hebrews
claim that the descendants of Moses should
get a cut. “Chu Chin Chow” finishes up at
the end of the week at the Palace.
* * * *
About a show of etchings:—
Nothing leaps tigerishly at one from the rather
featureless forest of sound but cautious work at
present being shown by the Painter-Etchers’ Society
at Farmer’s Gallery, Sydney. Squire Morgan has
had two shots at a group of trees and a misty head-
land near Deewhy, and pleasantly succeeded in
one of them. There is a clean antiseptic flavor about
G. Warner’s study of Sydney’s street of prescription-
ists, but the planes in his “Bundagobilly Creek” are
wrong. T. Friedensen’s "Sunlit Canal” has been
bought by the Art Gallery; it owes more to acci-
dental groupings than to the artist’s composition.
John Shirlow is, as usual, a faithful scribe of
Melbourne’s rectilinear architecture; and John Good-
child, whose first essays in art were made in war-
time soldier’s periodicals, has dealt with equal
honesty with Adelaide. Two of J. C. A. Traill’s
three studies of a bridge in course of building have
insight and decorative quality, and there is emo-
tion in an old man’s head by the meteoric J. H.
Fit nagan. A. HI Full wood is satisfying and eS.
cicnt, and Sid Lcetg does not forget how to draw hi s
vigorous magpies and kookaburras; his "River Side’*
is also full of clever emphasis and suppression.
Amongst the imported work our old friend Mortimer
Menpes contributes a lively portrait of Whistler;
Lampied has some examples full of action in his
individual style; and Ethel Gahain, after her
fashion, balances large empty spaces with singly
figures. The work of the English artists is not
bursting with courage and inspiration, either.
** * *
Melbourne audiences are so fond of “Thp
Merry Widow” that the management was
moved to announce that, after staging “Sybil’’
for three nights to meet its obligation to
those who had booked seats, the older fri-
volity would be returned to the boards of
Melbourne Majesty’s for three nights this
week. Sybil” itself, presented last Satur-
ciay, was a pleasing enough production in
which Gladys Moncrieff was a little less
lively than usual—she is the lady who, to
save her lover from arrest, poses as the
Grand Duchess, and so places herself in the
power of the amorous Grand Duke Constan-
tine. Claude Fleming’s Grand Duke was
robust but less colorful than it might have
been. He did not seem really to care whether
anybody loved him. _ As Captain Petroff, the
lover who deserts his regiment and involves
everybody in trouble, John Ralston made
good use of a bigger opportunity than gen-
erally comes his way, though he retained
his habit of singing as if his voice was choked
with teeth; the monotonous mannerisms of
Leslie Holland did not spoil his Governor of
Bomsk; Harry Ratcliffe did good work as the
hotel manager; and Arthur Stigant, as the
impresario, Otto Spreckler, looked after the
comedy department. Dainty Nellie Payne,
whose reception showed her popularity, made
Otto’s wife, Margot, a bright achievement; but
Bryl Walkley, as the real Grand Duchess,
was so overweighted_ witli dignity that she
hardly gave the indignant lady any force.
None of the others made an impression, good
or bad.

"The Truth About Blayds” would have been

will show closed doors on Friday of this
week: the Royal, where “Lightnin”’ fades
out to-night, and Moscovitch arrives as “Shy-

other, on December 20.

oA way to find out
You could, of course, say point blank, “What would you like for Christmas?
But that would destroy the little air of mystery.
There is a way out of it. Asking him: “Does your razor strop its
own blades? Does it leave your face all nice and smooth?” Or: “Do
you get forty or fifty good shaves with the same blade?” If he says
“No”—then you can safely give him a “Valet razor. You can be
quite certain that a “Valet” is what he wants, even though he may
not know it himself.
Christmas is no time for reasons why. But you must hear very briefly why.
the “Valet” is the best safety razor in the world.
It strops its own blade in a few seconds—on scientific principle—without
any unscrewing. It is cleaned as quickly—again without being taken to
pieces.
So find out whether he has got a “Valet” Razor. If not, he needs one.
Make him a present of one this Christmas.

THE P. & C. KEEPS FAITH—ALWAYS!

N the financial stability of your Life
Office depends the future safety of
your wife, child and dependants at
a most critical period of their lives.
Look well into this factor.
The stability of the P. & C. comes from two
sources, and is easily proved. Firstly, its
soundness is guaranteed by its association with
the foremost co-operative societies in each State
—bodies that are the foundation of the
country’s prosperity.
Secondly, the healthy growth of the Company
is due to its fair dealing, prompt settlements;
friendly help to policy-holders and sound
financial policy.
That is why we are able to say—
THE P. & C. KEEPS FAITH—ALWAYS.

windows as the artist is in presenting some of these
pictures. She has a fine appreciation of tone and
a good idea of form, but she has no right to leave
hands unpainted. Her best portrait work is in
“Black and White,” a study with fine animation
in it; and “Little Dancers” are well handled in
a big canvas. The lady has a method of showing
pond water which is unusually truthful. “Early
Spring” and “A Sunny Pond” are likeable studies;
but the tendency to make a blurry effect express
atmosphere, and, incidentally, cover faulty work, is
far too much in evidence.
In Miss Jessie Traill’s studio, 178 Collins-street,
is a mixed show, the bulk of it candidly an exni-
bition of Christmas gifts. The most distinguished
work is by John Shirlow —etchings of which “The
Great Dome” and “The Gate of the City” are best.
C. Swinton Diston has a show at Margaret McLean’s
studio, Collins-street. This young artist has a long
way to go; but his work show r s a painstaking sin-
cerity which makes it worthy of a mention. “The
Organist” (No. 23), “Still Life” (No. 4) and the
study of “Storm Clouds” (No. 14) all give indi-
cations of future good work.
To-day Australian advertising artists are turning
out as good work as any produced in America; and
poster and ad. designs by the pupils and ex-pupils
of the Melbourne Commercial Art School, shown at
the Queen’s Hall, illustrate what is being done by
only a small section of this army. The works of
53 students from this school is shown, and the
women are responsible for some of the best examples.
Beryl Hartland, Nancy Dolson and Nutta Buzacott
(whose two-color poster, “Prevent Forest Fires,” is
striking) are amongst the most praiseworthy. Oliver
Dale’s “Trans-Australian Railway” poster is vigorous
and attractive. However, much better work than
any shown here is being done in Australia now;
it would be interesting to have a combined show of
the product of the commercial artists. There is
a much finer exhibition in the new Capitol Building
of the posters used by English railway companies
to advertise holiday resorts. Such names as Brang-
wyn, Maurice Grieffenhagen and Frank Mason figure
on these posters, some of which are art masterpieces.
The Arts and Crafts Society has been exhibiting
a £3OO book consisting of 27 original water-colors
by Blamire Young, with letterpress hand-printed
by J. T. Forman and the artistically executed binding
done by Miss Margaret Alston and 11. Green. Its
title is “Adventures in Art,” and the value is there
for anyone who can get over the idea that the
proper place for a picture is the wall.
The Melbourne citizen can seek a cool
change from the swelter of summer —a rather
uncertain swelt so far —at the Majestic, the
Great White North, featured in “The Lure
of the Yukon,” being the main item in the
bill there this week. It is alleged to incor-
porate some of the farthest-north films yet
taken. At Hoyt’s de Luxe “Wine” is on
tap as a solemn warning to reputable subur-
banites who experience a desire to feel the
traces under their hocks.
The return of Scott and Whaley to Mel-
bourne Tivoli moves this'Showman to en-
dorse his own opinion that they are the best
of the laugh-makers seen during the last few
months at that theatre. Keeping their patter
clean, they gather their mead of hearty
laughter in an effortless fashion, and when
they leave off the audience is still wanting
more.
** * *
The weakest thing about “Good Morning,
Dearie,” now at the Adelaide Royal, is its
name, which tells nothing, and leaves one
guessing a few months later as to what the
thing was about. Josie Melville is, for the
most part, her popular self, and George Vol-
laire is a hero with the bright personality
which has been notably lacking in leading-
juveniles of late years. But the show relies
mainly on a riot of dancing. Under the trees
at the Exhibition gardens is Humphrey
Bishop’s co.; the weather has summerised
to meet it, and the whole light show is en-
joyable. Another new thing is a floating
dance-floor on the Torrens lake. The York
lias a true Sheik picture, “A Son of the
Sahara,” with 8000 camels—count them if
you doubt it. At West’s is Conan Doyle
with his west-country Baskerville hound.
Wondergraph is merely intense with “Rouged
Lips” and “The Guilty One,” Viola Dana
and Agnes Ayres.
sfc
Two Adelaide shows :
The Graphic Arts exhibition from England is now
on view in Preece’s Gallery. It is astonishing mainly
for not trying to astonish. Very correct and un-
enterprising are most of these works, where origin-
ality and modernity on the part of' the younger
school would be expected. John Copley does have
something of the deliberate ungracefulness of the
moderns ; but his toilers lifting a marble slab have
merely the unintentional (and lamentable) humor of
the weedy stage-hand who “goes on” as a trooper
of Napoleon. Greta Delleany is unusual in a study
of a multitude of pigs. But the whole show leaves
very little definite impression on the mind.
At the Society of Arts Gallery are the photo-
graphs gathered abroad by Mrs. Alfred Milson—not
for sale, and exhibited as an example for Aus-
tralians. Cliffs, battleships and breakers by F. J.
Mortimer; striking portraits of a man by Swan
Watson and of a boy by Herbert Lambert; an
unusual grouping of nudes by Francis Jay; a few
works in color. Altogether a fine show, and not
so much tortured to look unlike photography as
such things used to be a few years back.

“Abbot Park”: Puccini, who has joined
the top row in the heavenly choir, was first
known to Australia by his “La Bolieme, ’ at
Melbourne Majesty's, in 1901. Sandwiched
in among the sugary strains of Donizetti and
early Verdi, its absence of “set” solo num-
bers and the composer’s daring harmonic pro-
gressions came as a surprise. "Madame
Butterfly” arrived in 1910, with Bel Sorel
and Amy Castles alternating the name-part;
and in 1911 the Melba co. brought the
tragedy-laden “La Tosca.” The last offering
from the gifted Italian’s pen was “Manon
Lescaut,” done by the Quinlan crowd in 1913.
After the more artistic “Bolieme” and “But-
terfly” it was rather disappointing, especially
in the last act.
“C. Ockney”: “Betty,” who only recently
foilnd her way to Sydney Majesty’s, is quite
a middle-aged piece of goods. Daly’s, London,
saw the demure damsel first, getting on for a
decade ago. Paul Rubens, who was responsible
for the music, but is best remembered for his
"Miss Ilook of Holland,” has been dead five
years. Australia’s old theatrical acquaint-
ance, G. P. Huntley, was the original Lord
Playne, and it is safe to say that he in-
vented all the gags of the part, including
the long dialogue with the cockatoo. Hunt-
ley is an adept in that class of fooling, as
witness his talk to the bottle of schnapps in
the aforesaid “Miss Hook of Holland.” tin
his last visit G.P. seemed to have lost his
punch, but his method is hardly suitable to
a Tivoli vaudeville environment. At his
best, he is one of the finest character com-
edians that ever trod the boards.
J. F.. Hogan’s last London letter:—
Lorna and Toots Pounds have parted company for
the present. Toots is in a new revue entitled “Bv
the Way,” and the cast includes Cicely Courtneidge,
in whom the Australian has a certain interest—she
was born at Sydney one April Fool’s Day, while dad
was playing with the Gaiety co. But revue seems
to be on its last legs in London. Its authors have
apparently exhausted their powers of invention and
are reduced to dishing up the stalest of stuff. A
thing called “The Looking Glass,” at the Vaudeville,
has been generally slated, and Connie Ediss is in
it, too.
“Tcss of the D’Urbervilles,” dramatised by Hardy
himself, is shortly to be seen on the stage. Hardy
converted it into a play not long after its first publi-
cation, but stowed the manuscript away in a
locker, where it has remained for more than 30
years. He has now presented it to the Hardy Players,
a company of amateurs, and they are going to produce
it in Dorchester Corn Exchange. It is in four acts
and an epilogue, the latter being the tragical scene
at Stonehenge where Tess bids farewell to 'Angel
Clare.
Billed as “an Australian soubrette,” Clarice Hard-
wicke is copiously praised by the Star. She is said
to have a “record of Australian successes behind her,”
and London theatregoers are assured that she is
“one of the best all-round comediennes Australia has
produced for many years.” Perhaps so, but the
writer hasn’t really done the little woman a service
by laying it on so thick.
A benefit is being organised to assure a regular
income for veteran Arthur Roberts. Arthur made
a lot of money in his time, but it went as swiftly
as it came, and he has had to turn to again at
threescore and twelve and take what engagements he
can get.
Asche holds the records for long and short runs
at His Majesty’s. There were 2238 performances
of “Chu Chin Chow,” whereas “The Royal Visitor'
was withdrawn after a week. “It was pretty hope-
less from tne start,” said Oscar, apropos of the
“Visitor.” “You can’t reproduce a French farce on
the British stage.” But why didn’t he think of
that before? He consoles himself with the reflection
that farce and comedy have never succeeded at
His Majesty’s, and hints that there were professional
play-wreckers in the gallery at the first performance ;
but, then, he has rather developed a habit of manu-
facturing ghosts and other grievances, and it doesn’t
help his popularity. He has been chaffed a good
deal on the rotundity he has developed since he was
last seen in London. One critic declared that he
looked as if he had put on two or three tons during
his stay in Australia. To another he conjured up
a vision of “Falstaff in a frock coat.”
“E,T.”: Comment was made in a recent
Bulletin regarding Rudyard Kipling's few
attempts at play-writing. A one-acter of
Kip.’s called “Gow’s Watch” was staged on
a Sunday night in October at Lord Howard
de Walden’s Belgrave-square mansion. The
piece was programmed as “a fragment—all
that is written of this play: the author calls
it Act 11, Scene 2.” One critic unkindly re-
marked that one could forgo the rest with
equanimity.
“R.K.D.N.”: The Jewett stock company
in Boston (B. 27/11/’24) lias fallen on evil
days. In the last week of October the con-
cern was compelled to suspend its perform-
ances, following five unsuccessful weeks at
a large playhouse, to which the company
had during its last season transferred. A
prominent member of the crowd—one Clive
—lias undertaken to carry on after an inter-
val, but meanwhile the name of Jewett, which
has meant so much to theatrical Boston
through a number of years, will disappear
from this venture. It is, unfortunately, not
an unusual ending to repertory schemes on
the other side of the world.
“F.T.K.”: After Bert Bailey’s appearances
in grand opera (B. 4/12/’24) the MacMahon
brothers had a spasm of melodrama at Syd-
ney Lyceum; with Bert in low-comedy roles,
Harry Diver as the heavy and Helen Bur-
dette as heroine. A versatile citizen is
Bailey. I wonder how many theatregoers
are aware he is something of a conjurer?
At private gatherings he has given turns
HUNDREDS TURNED AWAY NIGHTLY.
“How’s business?”
“Turning ’em away, laddie; turning ’em away.”
“Gee, I didn’t think your company was that bad! Why don’t
you try lockin’ the doors when you get ’em in?”
which would make him a top number in the
world of magic.
“Demos” : George Dawe, who died recently
in Melbourne, will be remembered by patrons
of Bilanderson’s bludeurdlers as the dashing
hero who nightly rescued the heroine from
a fate more cruel than death. Dawe was
usually chosen by impecunious members of
the cast, who assembled each day at a pub
in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, to approach
Bill for a sub. He was a super, for a couple
of years in the big European drama, and
on his return he gave up acting for a steadier
job—that of monumental mason.
“Cmsar’s Ghost” : Starting at the game 18
years ago, architect H. E. White, who, jug-
gling with inches, has turned the Melbourne
Athenaeum into a charming little theatre, has
been a mighty constructor and reconstructor
of playhouses—nearly a hundred, indeed.
The remodelling of the Royal in Sydney, and
of the new Princess’s and the new Palace in
Melbourne, has been portion of his work; he
is responsible for the double-decked St.
James’s Theatre in course of erection in Syd-
ney for the Fullers, and he has at the present
time six theatres in hand in Queensland for
E. J. Carroll. The one in Ipswich will give
that town a thoroughly up-to-date show
place; others are at Townsville, Bundaberg,
Maryborough and Rockhampton. White
was born in Dunedin (M,L.), and did his
first theatre work at the Christchurch Opera
House. The Fullers brought him to Aus-
tralia in 1912. He has never been abroad,
and, although he has adopted many over-
seas improvements, he reckons that his de-
signs are Australasian.
“Amity” : Australia’s opinion of Toti Dal
Monte has been endorsed by Chicago, where
the plump and captivating little lady appeared
recently as Lucia. All the critics applauded
her, and the Tribune man, who speaks with
the voice of authority, hails her Mad Scene
as the finest in his experience. And among
the Lucias he has seen are Galli-Curci and
Tetrazzini.
“Exile”: “Hamfat’s” reference to Harry
Lauder’s first salary (B. 20/11/’24) reminds
me. In 1901 my mate and I took two con-
firmed Londoners to dinner at the Cafe
Monico, and thence to the Pav. One item
was an “extra turn,” the artist being name-
less. The song was “Tobermory,” and to
the horror of our well-upholstered guests,
who complained that it was beastly bad form,
my wife and I led the laughter, and banged
our hands together till the extra turn came
back. Two years later-, being in London
again, we were conducted to the Alhambra
by one of our former guests, who said he
had a great treat for us, and that we really
mustn’t miss it. And there was oiir extra
turn, now beaming and prosperous—in fact,
the rage of London.
“Charlik”: In London once a person with
a litigious bent went to see a theatrical per-
formance, only to find that an understudy
was playing instead of the lady who was the
attraction in his
case. Although an
“in - consequence-
of - the - indisposi-
tion” slip was in-
serted in the free
programme, he de-
manded his money
back, and eventu-
ally got it after he
had threatened legal
proceedings. After
this managements
announced that
they did not guar-
antee the appear-
ance of any indivi-
dual. This substi-
tution business is
fairly common in
Australia, and I
often wonder how a
management would
get on if the ex-
ample of the argu-
mentative Cockney
were copied. Some-
times the change
is unannounced,
and then members
of the audience
might go away
under the impres-
sion that they had
seen the artist
whose name was
on the programme,
an impression
perhaps dam ag-
ing to that artist
or unfair to the un-
derstudy if. as in
the Girard-Whelan
case, the under-
study was the
better performer.
As to that, I was
a member of the
“Belle of New
York” co. for a
part of the time,
and I heard it re-
marked after one of
Whelan’s perform-
ances, “G ira r d
must be improving—his voice was much
better to-night.” Whelan’s impersonation
was certainly marvellous.
The Christmas Bulletin, which will be
on the bookstalls on Saturday (Dec. 13),
contains the cream of the stories, verse and
drawings that have come into the Sydney
and Melbourne offices during the past 12
months. Humor is the predominant note of
the issue, and the men and women who por-
tray it have never been in better form.
Geoff Litchfield’s full page, “Time Passes
By,” is a striking presentation of the in-
difference of carefree youth and the holiday-
ing crowds to the rush of the passing years,
and the despair of those who see the end in
sight. Percival’s fine wash-drawing will be
appreciated by all who endeavor year by
year to thread their ivay through the parcel-
laden Christmas crowds. “Syd. .C.’s” humor-
our verse which describes the exit of a circus
from a country town is fittingly illustrated
by Percy Leason. Also there are about 70
joke-drawings that picture almost every phase
of Australian life, from the surf beaches to
the dusty roads out back; from the police
court to the drawung-room.
EPITAPH FOR THAT PROMISING YOUNG
AUSTRALIAN ACTOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here lies a good Australian by
His careless country slain.
Oh, let him in the fair earth lie,
He may not hope again!
He comes no more to dance, to sing
Beneath his own blue sky.
Say he was free —yea, as bird’s wing.
Free ? Free to starve and die!

Allen’s Stag Ore Crushers and
Stone Breakers are made of the
highest-grade Sheffield Steel
All wearing parts are easily renewable
The jaw faces in “Stag” Crushers are made of Allen’s
“Imperial” Manganese Steel, and are particularly strong.
They are so fitted that they can be renewed or reversed
by an unskilled laborer. All parts of these machines
have easy means of lubrication, and provision is made
for renewals where necessary.
Regulating size of broken material
A “Stag” Crusher can be adjusted, while the machine is
running, to produce broken-up material of any required
size. This is effected by the use of cast-iron wedge blocks.
The engineering department of Edgar Allen & Co., Ltd.,
Sheffield, specialises in crushing machinery. As experts
in the production of the highest-grade Sheffield Steel,
Edgar Allen & Co., Ltd., are exceptionally well equipped
for the manufacture of machines in which the actual
composition of the steel used is so important. Write for

COMET
The Persian Water*wheel
used for irrigation in Nubia
inB.C. 525 was the direct
predecessor of the pump
proper. The wheel by which
the jugs were raised to the
desired level was kept in
motion by bullocks.
The “Comet” Windmill is the
practical water pumper of to-day.
Driven by the wind, it works night
and day without expense for power.
Direct action, correct balance, sim-
plicity, extreme sensitiveness and
rigid strength are all factors in
practicability, resulting in reliable ser-
vice under all conditions. Make sure
of such service by choosing a 'Comet.*

this is especially evidenced at Harvest
\j vosdsaofj v
SdDlOjddfl
Cletrac’s all-round utility on the farm
has been definitely proved, and at
Harvest in particular it is a genuine
boon to the Farmer. Its capacity for
Stripping the Crop, Hauling in and
Threshing the Grain means a saving of
Time, Labor and Money. Its Mechani-
cal Excellence enables it to work day-
after day without any stoppages for
rest or sore shoulders as in the case of
horse teams. If you would handle
your Harvest with celerity, then make
“Cletrac” your Tractor.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. So
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted: and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Mary E. L.: It dawdles along an old
far'.iliar lane. .. .L. J.M.: Slight, but rather well done.
... .R.I.G.: Both on the borderline ; you should easily
be able to find a market for them elsewhere....
Oontoo: Can’t detect a glimmer of hope. .. .W.G.K.:
He has gone elsewhere....Ivenso: It sounds hollow;
you don’t really believe a word of it or feel a single
one of those emotions... .F.H.T.: Sorry space won’t
allow it. .. .Francis R. G.: Yes, yes, we’ve had all
that: whft we want now are some working plans.. . .
Sarpedon: What little grain there was in it has been
trodden out.... Leamington: Has hardly the grip.
But it’s fairly ingenious... .A.N.G.I.: Too easy....
Sandy Mac: We wore out a perfectly good pair of
ears reading it... .G.A.L.: “Road” trodden very
bare... C.W.C.: Poor and ragged... .P.L. (North
Bondi): You have to learn the game before you
can play it.... Bilbaid: Not interesting enough for a
shocking example... .G.V.W.: The little verse sent
is purely imitative. There is no natural child-obser-
vation or feeling in it. .. .B.C.F.: Its only distinc-
tion is a curiously bad rhyme—“Trinity,” “tran-
quillity”.... Calidore: Bad.... Dora T.: Doesn’t get
near enough to vamp the printer... .H.G.B.: Too
wild and sudden... .S.P. (Gordon): Not up... .Ethel
F.: Poor rort of stuff E.M.E.: “The Orchestra”
can’t get a job here... .E.J.L.: Weak commonplaces
in stumbling rhyme... .Margaret D.: Not up to the
knocker... .I.M.B.: In that medium you make it
rather dreary Frederic F.: They miss, but not
by a great distance T. J.C.: The terse doesn’t
carry the praise... .Adele V.: It has no resemblance
to a poem.... Thirteen ; All very bad.... The Muse:
Even a tender age can scarcely excuse the pomposity
of it... .T.J.C.: Not bad, but hasn’t enough interest.
.... R. de V. D.: Sheer rubbish.... Bellerive: The
excursion into Chinatown makes a bold departure:
“Sing work in garden,”
Said Chong to Ah Can,
“Sing since money up,
A velly good plan.
Sing go to China,
He crazy old bear,
Too rnuchee growl-growl,
Too rnuchee swear.
He marry lillie girl,
And she spendee cash;
She boozee all day.
Too rnuchee flash.
Pong Ki velly thin,
Pong a sick bloke,
No likee chicken stew,
Too rnuchee smoke.
Sam Poon do-ee well,
He makee big rise.
He’s brother dam’ fool.
Sam velly wise.”
. ...C.D.S.: The verse is crude and the mirth sad.
. ...Jacky R.: Not enough there.... Barbara D.:
They all have a musical movement, but they amount
to very little. Send us something more definite and
drop the “thee” and “thou”... .M.M.K.: They don’t
strike us very hard.... Hal S.: The lines are prose.
.... Unumgar; Sorry, not improved.... Hoani C.:
You haven’t the knack. Anyhow, the yarn is too thin.
....M.B. (Forest Lodge): Confused ideas in poor
verse... .J.B. (Mt. Lofty): The “Pig-sty” is too
stiff in the joints ; but the accumulation of flowers all
in the same season is remarkable. .. .P.M.M.: The
Maori girl dancing among the gum-trees is not as
attractive as some we’ve met. .. .Cecil K.: Not handled
well enough to carry your meaning. .. .Stella S.: The
old commonplaces in weak verse... .Black Watch: The
lines don’t carry it brightly enough.... Pretty Kid:
Have at the villain in your own determined fashion:
You made me love you; don’t think that I’ll forget
You ugly horrid serpent, but I’ll get you yet,
Crawling round and sneaking after me, and making
a show,
With your walking-stick and glasses and your silly
toothbrush mo.,
And brushing your bit of hair to bide the bald spot;
All the other girls called you a silly nincompop;
And when you read this it will make you squirm I
know,
With your ugly bandy legs and your silly tooth-
brush mo.
. .. .H.V.P.: Chocolate and stamps too meagre food.
S.S.M.: Your kinema story is too kinematic... .H.P.:
Not badly written, but the subject is not attractive.
. ...A.B.; All sons think all fathers are duds. No
need to rub the fact in... .Neo: Stale and crude... .
J.G.: Has some of the glamor of old days, but not
enough to earn its space... .H.E.S.: Your amorous old
gentleman has been put to bed.. . .N.D.: All much too
long. .. .H.J.C.W.: Like Barkis, we are “willin’.”
Read good literature, more of it, and still more of
it. Then write and tear up for, say, a year
A.J.: You say “His personality diffused a spacious
absence of constraint.” Sounds like something in
a teapot... .R.J.D.: Cure for insommia passed on to a
neighbor’s dog. . . . J.K..T.: The Christmas hamper has
been made up E.A.T.: Try to get more zip into
your stuff.... Fesha: But the West Australian Bank
doesn’t deserve all the credit. It simply hasn't
been allowed to hand out shares at par after the
manner of similar concerns in the eastern States
The Perth Parliament’s idea was that the bank
mustn’t be allowed to become a close corporation,
and that when new shares were issued the public
must be allowed in. Which, of course, explains
why new share issues have been at a stiff premium.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
E.L.: Ireland has got Home Rule of a kind; and
your picture is worse than the kind she’s got....
J.E.C.: The best thing about it is the circle. But
the Art Editor can draw all the circles this paper
needs with the office compasses... .C.McC.: Your
black ladies excluded under the Act... .A.T.G.:
There is feeling in your line, but it needs exercise.
. ...A.E.; You ask us not to answer back: but
like the fleas on the scratching small boy, you
started on us first.... Duanrats: We are familiar
with the lazy knave who hides the hands he can’t
draw in pockets; but the impostor who cuts off
two pairs of feet, slices away two pairs of hands,
then turns the backs of his mutilated victims to-
wards the audience, is new to us....R.S.: “Life
on Mars” is beyond us—63 million miles, to be
exact .K.F.: Not in our line.
“P.D.M.”: “Ellae” errs when he cites Vic-
toria and George III. as examples of long-
lived eldest children (B. 13/ll/’24). The
latter, like Edward VII., was preceded by
a sister; and Victoria’s mother was a widow
■with one daughter when she married the
Duke of Kent. Also, in view of the heavy
infant mortality of those days, and the fact
that all three of them were born some years
after the marriage of their parents, I would
class Henry III., Edward III. and Mary
Tudor as doubtful first-borns. Katherine
of Aragon, at least, is known to have had
many children.

FIRTH’S
“Die-hard” Hacksaws
will reduce your manufacturing costs.
Just now, when only the fittest can sur-
vive—when only the careful cutting out
of waste and leakage wherever they
occur in manufacturing processes means
the difference between profit and loss, it
is a pity to miss a definite opportunity
to effect positive and obvious economy.
Firth’s Die-hard Blades
with
Spring Temper Backs
are specially recommended both for hand
and machine use. They combine the
advantages of the “Soft-back” blade with
stiffness and cutting qualities of the
“All-hard” blades. Where breakage lias
been prevalent they prove their economy.

SIX GOOD REASONS
Why You Should Use
KRUSES .
Fluidji#—
1. The purity is guaranteed, and the quality never
varies.
2. For quickly correcting a disordered stomach, there is
not a better remedy in the world.
3. It counteracts the effects of over-eating or over-
drinking. One wine glassful is sufficient.
4. For Children it is postively safe and
wholesome—the genuine Kruse’s con-
tains no harmful drugs.
5. It allays feverish conditions due to
vaccination and teething.
6. A pleasant drink. More like a spark-
ling spa than a medicine.

“Morob”: The ukase of the N. S. Wales
Department of Agriculture that poppies are
no longer to be grown has been misinterpreted
by some people as a death-sentence on the
beautiful and popular “Iceland” poppy.
Actually it is aimed only at tin* opium poppy
(Papaver somniferum) , which is rarely seen
in X. S. Wales or any other part of Austra-
lia. The declaration is in accordance with
the resolve of the League of Nations to re-
strict the manufacture of opium.
* * * *
“C.C.” : Yeast made as a brewery by-pro-
duct is being used in Melbourne in a form
in which it lias all the qualities as a food
product of the best Fritz preparations (B.
28/10/’24). The extract, called vegemite, is
an entiroly-Australian achievement. The de-
bittering process is simple and substantially
as described by “Hops,” but the later treat-
ment demands accurate chemical control.
Yitamine “B” (now spelt without the final
“e” in the best circles) is particularly at
home in yeast, and this anti-neurotic factor
is retained without loss of potency in the
extract.
* * * *
“Caesar” : An innovation in Bananaland is
the bacon cos.’ new method of buying pigs
over the scales at railway stations. The
raisers are paid 70 per cent, on live weight.
The standard weight is 1051 b. to 1201 b.,
which receives top price. Two squealers are
run on to the scales at once, and the farmer
receives his cheque on the spot. This system
is much appreciated. Formerly, if a farmer
trucked his pigs away and they happened to
be under-weight or over-weight, he was
docked Id. per lb. Under the new system he
can cart them home again if the weight is
unsatisfactory.
* * * #
“Sturt”: Port Adelaide is making a firm
effort to stop the stealing of steamer cargo.
The Commissioner of Police mentions in his
latest report that (1) seven prosecutions for
unlawful possession have resulted in six con-
victions ; (2) more police are needed on the
job; (3) “marked hostility” has latterly been
shown towards some of the six constables
engaged, with sundry threats, and one case
of actual assault; and (4) “.Since then the
men have gone armed, and have been in-
structed not to go into dangerous places
singly.” But nobody has noticed a union
taking any action in the matter.
* * * *
“Sou’-East”: Talking of crayfish (B.
20/11/’24), Kingston, in the south-east of
South Aus., finds them profitable; some of
its boats are credited with netting over a
thousand a year out of the crustacean. The
train from Kingston runs on only three days
a week, and the afternoons before its de-
parture are busy ones for the fishermen.
The large floating crates moored close to the
jetty are hauled aboard by means of a crane,
and hundreds of kicking cray are packed
between layers of wet seaweed in petrol
cases for despatch to Melbourne, Adelaide,
Broken Hill and other hamlets. The King-
stonian himself goes crayless to bed, the
fisher folk being much too affluent to worry
about Bie local trade.
* * * •
“The Deacon”: The latest catch for the
worried housewife in the stock of the “smart
Aleck” who wears out suburban doorbells is
a patent cheap varnish, the merits of which
he ingratiatingly offers to prove by a practi-
cal demonstration. The unwary woman
usually lets him have a go at the chairs or
the table-legs, and, although she may en-
thusiastically agree that the operation is
eminently successful, she rarely feels justified
in breaking into the rent money to acquire
the home-brightener. In a day or two, how-
ever, she realises that the remainder of the
decorated article must be treated to preserve
harmony in the household furniture. At
this psychological moment the confederate
blows along, views the handiwork of his pal,
and unloads the supplementary varnish.
* * * *
“P. J.Q.”: Here’s the sort of case that
makes anarchists of us quiet people. A fruit
inspector called the other day and without
making any inspection asked a single ques-
tion. “Have the fruit-trees been sprayed
with arsenate of lead?” he rapped out. He
was told they had been sprayed with other
mixtures and were quite clean. Then he rose
to his full official height and gave his com-
mand : “Spray them with arsenate of lead
within three weeks.” The trees are all loaded
with ripening fruit —a crop which has been
worked for and secured by honest labor.
There is not a trace of blight in the garden
and there are no bordering orchards; yet here
is the official order to poison all the ripening
fruit in the midst of a season the like of
which may not be seen again for a decade.
In the event of children eating that fruit,
will a charge of wilful murder lie against
that inspector or the head of the N. S. Wales
department which employs him?
BALLADE OF GOOD INTENTIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From many a lengthy list,
Deep pondering, 1 chose;
No classic fount 1 missed
Whence information flows;
The very choicest prose,
Verse that can never die—
These, these alone compose
The books I meant to buy
Yet on my shelves persist,
In ever-swelling rows,
The vulgar humorist,
The bard who merely bio -vs.
The novelist who shows
Poor Nature all awry,
And only Heaven knows
The books I meant to buy.
One with unwearied wrist
The path of virtue straws
With snares of cunning twist;
My purpose he o’erthrows;
And, as the money goer
In printed sins, I sigh—
Ah me, I’homme propose!
The books I meant to buy !
Envoy.
Ask not for last year’s snows
0 curious soul, r.or why
I’m still bereft of those
The books I meant to buy.

Every woman knows there is nothing more delightful
to the senses than the enchantment of a really
choice perfume. This delight is experienced in
perfection by all who use Atkinson’s latest creation,
Californian Poppy, an exquisite perfume in which
the tender fragrance of freshly-gathered flowers has
been skilfully imprisoned and concentrated by a
master of the perfumer’s art.
The adorable fragrance of Californian Poppy
Perfume has taken London, Paris and New York
by storm and has woven its irresistible charm
amongst the women of Australia.
And the triumph of the Perfume is shared by its
attendant suite of exquisite toilet preparations—
Beauty Creams, Complexion Powders, Soaps,
Bath Salts, Hair Lotions, Shampoo Powders and
Sachets —all harmoniously scented with Californian
Poppy so that the complete feminine toilet can be
performed in accordance with fashion’s latest
dictates.

MESSItS. JOHN SANDERSON & CO., 171 AVilliam Street, Melbourne.
• MESSRS. DAEGETY & CO;, Brisbane.
A sarn-major of former days, Thomas
McMillan, has died at Marton (M.L.), aged
88. A native of Co. Down, he. started sol-
diering with the 18th Royal Irish, and was
one of the guard of honor at Queen \ ic-
toria’s wedding.
When the old hands foregather along N. S.
Wales Southern line, once more the wonder-
ful ride of William Hazelwood will be re-
vived. That old-timer of Goulburn rode from
his home town to Sydney in eight hours.
Death recently intervened before any other
ambitions horseman had interfered with his
half-century record.
“Baby” Miles, of Marble Bar, and M.L.C.
for Pilbarra (W.A.), is a staunch advocate
of the development of tropical Australia, and
has lectured on the subject in most parts of
the Empire. Cricket is among his weak-
nesses, and on one occasion when his team
was defeated in Broome the ladies of his
district telegraphed a challenge to play the
XI -when they returned. Miles replied offer-
ing to submit it to arbitration.
“Danda”: Railway trucks are not the
only places where animals suffer needless
cruelty. Livestock conveyed by coastal boats
have their own particular brand of horror;
they are often confined between decks for
days without food or water, and, after un-
shipping, sometimes driven miles to the place
of slaughter or sale. Watch the droves of
pigs coming up Sussex-street (Sydney) in
the early morning and see the thirst-tortured
brutes licking the moisture from the gutters.
Crossed to the other bank at Cuba Plains
(N.Q.), John Downie Houghton, aged 61. one
of the finest bushmen of the Far North. Born
at Bowen, he was a boy when his parents
purchased Stonington station and other pas-
toral properties. In 1892 he became owner
of Cornelia, in the Cape district, and 18
years later sold out and took up Cuba Plains.
A strange ambition to make a political career
for himself earned him two defeats.
Sam Manger, one-time Federal P.M.G.,
besides running a Prohibition monthly under
the auspices of the Anti-Liquor League and
carrying on a private business, is a member
of the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board and
of the Indeterminate Sentences Board. [He
preserves the buoyant enthusiasm of youth,
in spite of his 67 years, and still finds
plenty of time to preside over a couple of
wages boards and deliver an occasional lec-
ture on Criminology.
Tuan Chi-jui, the new President in Peking,
is the cowardliest of China’s timid politicians.
It is the possession of much ill-gotten wealth
that unnerves him in a crisis. It was he
who succumbed to Allied pressure in China
and declared war on Germany, although mil-
lions of his fellow-countrymen were not even
aware that a war was on. He was ousted
from his last term of office by the schoolboys
of the capital. A deputation waited on him
to protest against his Japanese policy, and
there was a little rioting outside. Tuan fled.
The only casualty of the revolution was a
young student who kowtowed so furiously in
the presence of the inwardly terrified states-
man that he cracked his skuil on the floor.
“Tasmaniac”: John Batman’s marriage
was not as precipitate as that of his rival,
John Pasco Fawkner (B. 20/11/’24), but
it was more romantic. As a young man in
the Speck he was employed as a constable to
track bushrangers to their haunts. One day
when, unaccompanied, he was in the ranges
following up a slight clue, he was suddenly
confronted by a beautiful girl. She had been
listed as an outlaw, having assisted some
bushranging relatives. It was a case of love
at first sight on both sides, and Batman,
hastening back to civilisation, earnestly soli-
cited the authorities to pardon her. Ilis
entreaties were successful, she became his
bride, and the scenario ended in perfect
happiness.
“914”: There is no need to leave Aus-
tralia and go to Maoriland for a high per-
centage of goitre (B. 13,/11/’24). In the
N. S. Wales districts of Tam worth and Mus-
wellbrook the percentage is high, and medi-
cal opinion attributes it to the same de-
ficiency of iodine in the water. The secre-
tion of the thyroid gland (which is involved
in goitre) is tri-iodo-tryptophane, so that a
supply of iodine in some form is essential.
Local authorities might take a tip from
America. At the clinic at gochester the
prevalence of simple parenchymatous goitre
in the town was noted, and the surgeons in-
duced the municipal authorities to add a
little potassium iodide to the water supply.
The result is that the percentage of children
with goitre has fallen to about 1 in 50 of
the old figure.
“0.P.H.”: Vic. Premier Allan boasted at
the Caledonian Society’s dinner in Melbourne
the other night that 12 of the 29 Premiers
of his State had been Scots and that half the
present Cabinet had smelt heather. As a
matter of solid fact, the whole of the present
Cabinet is Victorian-born, and, at best, can
claim only descent from Caledonia. Of the
12 Premiers to whom Allan referred, Murray,
Watt, Lawson and himself saw the light in
Vic., and xlllan McLean’s pet joke was that
he came to the State when he was four and
brought his parents with him. Nicholson,
McCulloch, McPherson, Service, Gillies,
Munro and Bowser (the ithers) owed
bushels more to their Australian environment
than to the land from which they were
“exiles.” Peacock’s late colleague, McPhair-
son, who piled up so many surpluses for Vic.,
is also a native of the State.
“Morehead” : I met newly-elected Senator
Jack Power for the first time while the
Dooley dispute was at its hottest. The
wholesale expulsion of defiant members had
split every league in the district, and a thou-
sand little wars were being waged between
embittered Dooleyites and supporters of the
A.W.U.-controlled executive. When Power,
with the Federal executive’s edict to bury
the hatchet, arrived at the meeting there
'were two opposing forces in the hall exchang-
ing heated words, straight lefts and upper-
cuts, while outside there was a miniature
Donnybrook in progress among those who
couldn’t gain admission. The peacemaker, a
very sick and fatigued person, faced
the task of quelling the din and pouring oil
on the troubled waters with amazing cour-
age. He seemed like a worn-out
dominie lecturing a class of unruly pupils,
and he was given a rough time for the first
hour. He kent his head and how-
ever, gradually wore down opposition, and
earned the cheers he got as he left the hall.

STARR.
Rexona Soap Gives Natural
Beauty to Skin and Hair.
That natural beauty of skin and hair which parmot be imitated can be
obtained by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary toilet
soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, winch
tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best ot such
soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams as
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skm affec-
tions is known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and h acial
Soap regularly once or twice* a day and see if it does not quickly soothe and
cleanse the pores, lessen the ten-
dency to pimples, and leave the
complexion clear, fresh and
velvety.

T h e Woman He Found.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
DON GARRY, a middle-aged bachelor
farmer, was getting wood with a
horse and slide when he came sud-
denly upon a young woman lying unconscious
in the long grass. Had he trodden upon
snake he couldn’t have been more surprised.
She was a woman of liberal proportions, an
rather good-looking. Don had a lot of secre
sentiment in him, but he was a rec usrv e,
bashful man. He had only recently boug 1
the farm, where he worked and cooked an
kept to himself; but often while he sat
smoked he saw in fancy a natty little woman
flitting like a sunbeam about the old siaD
hut. It had never had a woman m it,, ana
there was a superstition that it never wou .
The call of an expectant crow above mm
galvanised him into action, ihrowing
wood off, he tore up some grass to spreaa
on the slide; and five minutes later h •
driving home with the girl lying on 1 •
new light shone in his eyes. He had nevei
had a girl, but he had found this one, and
reckoned that findings ought to be he e P
His big frame was in a tremor as he lifted
her off at the hut and placed her on a
stretcher on the verandah, What to do
next he didn’t know. He had heard that
the proper thing was to undo all tight-
fitting clothes, but he shrank from takmg
such liberties. He was holding her hand
in a sheepish,' helpless fashion when .
opened her eyes and asked feebly tor
He ran through the hut and got a dipper-
ful of water from the cask at the back and,
raising her head with one haiid, lield tne
clumsy vessel to her lips with the other.
After taking a draught she sank back with
her hand to her head and asked if there were
any women about.
“There’s Mrs. Muddle an he le-
plied. “Stop here an’ I’ll get ’em.
1 He left her and ran all the way to
Muddles’ farm, which adjoined his. Arr !)'
ing in a breathless condition, it took him
some time to make them understand.
Finally grasping the situation, Mis. Mudd
and Sarah accompanied bun back. lie leu
the wav with hurried strides and was teann„
round and through the hut when they came
up. He met them at the door, the most
dazed and alarmed-looking man they had
ever soon. . n
“She ain’t here!” lie cried, his eyes roll-
The women laughed. “Was she ever heic?
asked Sarah.
The women looked at one another incredu-
lously. “Where did she come from? asked
Mrs. Muddle. _ . „ „ „
“I found her in the grass, I tell you, said
Don impatiently. T , „
“Such a cock-an’-bull story I never heard,
Sarah remarked. , . tt
Don turned into the hut again. . He
searched it through and through, the strained,
mystified look on his face never changing.
Coming back to the front, he noticed fresh
tracks of horses on the ground near the end
of the verandah. . . . , f
“See here,” he said, pointing to the hoot-
prints, “someone’s took her.”
“Shull!” said Sarah. “Who and take her.
“No tellin’,” said Don. “It s queer ap
Donings all round.” .
They examined the tracks. I can t make
it out,” said Mrs. Muddle. She must be
some sort of freak to ao off like that.
“’S a queer caper,” Don admitted. He
took his hat off and ruffled his damp hair.
“Never knowed the like of it before.
“If she should come back, Sarah re-
marked after awhile, “tie her up so we can
soo her.” -i i
Don felt humiliated. When they had
gone he saddled his horse and tried to follow
the tracks. The short, thick grass was a
blank carpet to his inexperienced eye, and
there were no open patches where he could
pick up the broken trail. , ,
Weeks went by; and when hope had almost
died within him; she suddenly flashed across
his view again. He saw her on the nvei
steamer as it passed upstream, while lie
leaned on his hoe in a patch of young maize.
He started violently and let the line drop.
Mounting a stump, he gazed after her until
the steamer disappeared behind a fringe ol
scrub. Then he rushed up to. his hut,
saddled his horse, and. changing las clothes,
rode hard after the steamer^
He heard it whistle at Dougherty s farm
and pulled up at the next point to see if
Brown Eves was still aboard. While he
waited. Len Scullv rode down from Brand s
and asked him if he had heard anything
more of the mystery woman.
“Thought I heard the Triton, said Don,
ignoring the question. “Yes, here she
°°“Lady on board,” said Scully, standing
in his stirrups. ,
Don stretched his neck. I wonder who
that ken be?” he mused. “Fancy Ive seen
the like of her before.” „
“It’s Horry Barmon’s sister Euey,
Scullv announced, as the boat came opposite.
“Well I’m danged!” Don ejaculated. An
he lives just on five mile from my place.
“About that.” said Scully, wondering.
Don suddenly recollected himself. If I
could see her anywhere now, twould save
me a ride this week. Got a message for

“Town, most likely,” drawled Scully.
“She goes up now an’ then for a day or two,

“I’m makin’ for town myself, said Don.
“Where does she put up at?”
“Rooney’s Corner, mostly. But she might
drop off anywhere.” ~ .
The steamer whistled near Brand’s farm,
and without another word Don went off at a

THE PENALTY OF OVERWORK
Many People are Beginning to Feel the Strain
The heavy tax of overwork, the extra strain so
necessary to many trades and occupations, is hard
on the kidneys. The kidneys fail in their work
and the poisonous matter collects in the system.
If your work seems hard for you, if you have a
lame, weak or aching back, if you seem tired and
listless, if you notice sediment in the urine,
unnatural color, or irregular passages, and seem
to be running down without apparent cause, begin
at once with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, the
remedy that has proved so beneficial to your
neighbors. It has brought strength to the backs
of thousands of working men and women. Sydney
proof is given here.

Story
A MAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. W. H. Trott, “Fairview,” Gannon Street, Tempe,
Sydney, says: “Off and on for years I suffered a good deal
from backache and kidney trouble. Sometimes my back used
to ache terribly, the pain being particularly severe when I
stooped. One day Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recom-
mended to me, so I bought some and they worked wonders.
After taking a few doses I felt much better, so I continued
with th£ treatment for a few weeks, and I am glad to say
they drove the pain out of my back and made me feel
splendid Two years have elapsed since then, and I am still
free of backache, but I keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills by
me, and take a dose or so whenever I feel a little off color,
and they always do me good.”
Twelve years later, Mr. Trott says: “Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me of backache 14 years ago, and I am
still free from this trying complaint.”
TWO SYDNEY
PEOPLE
CURED OF
BACKACHE
AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mrs. Emily Osborne, 5 Queen Street, Petersham, Sydney,
says: “Some years ago I had a very bad attack of disordered
kidneys, and, as a result suffered agony from backache and
rheumatic pains all over my body. I was often so bad that
I could hardly get about the house, every movement giving me
increased pain. My rest at night was very disturbed, as it was
impossible for me to lie in one position for any length of time,
owing to the nagging pain in my back. My ankles and arms
swelled a good deal, and were very painful if I touched them.
I had no energy for anything, and was really far from well.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recommended to me, and
after taking a course of these grand Pills I was completely
cured.”
Ten years later, Mrs. Osborne says: “Ten years have
elapsed since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me, and I
am still well, a fact that speaks volumes for this splendid
remedy.”

“Well, she passed some time ago. If
you can hear her now you must have sur-
prisin’ good ears.”
“I’m purty sharp in the ear,” Don said,
tightening his reins. “Must try an’ get
some o’ them spuds somewhere.”
He had to make a long round to cross a
scrubby creek, and when he clattered up to
Riley’s farmhouse he saw by the froth on the
water that the vessel was still in front.
“I was wonderin’ if you wanted to buy
any suckin’ pigs?” w T as his excuse for call-
ing.
“I’ve got a sty full of them,” said Riley.
He looked over his visitor’s horse, which
was lathering with sweat, and remarked that
Garry must be in a desperate hurry to sell
pigs.
“I’ve got an app’intment in town,” Garry
said, and clattered aw r ay again.
At the next point he touched he assured
himself that Lucy was still on board ; and
thence he jogged leisurely on to town.
An hour after dark he limped across to
Rooney’s, which was a shop and boarding-
house, using a stout stick to lean on. He
wore only one boot, the other foot being
encased in a pile of bandages. Two women
were behind the counter. One was Lucy,
but Don did not seem to notice her at
first.
“I was wonderin’,” he said to the other,
“if you sold pocket-knives?”
“We do stock them,” he was told, “but
we’re right out at present.”
Inwardly he rejoiced to hear it. “Just my
luck,” he said. “Got a bad foot —trod on a
rusty nail, an’ don’t want to walk too much
on it. May be in town for a day or two
with it.”
He was turning away when he pretended
to notice Lucy for the first time. “I believe
I’ve seen you before,” he said. “Ain’t you
the young lady I found in the grass?”
“Oh, you’re Mr. Garry?” she cried, spring-
ing up with a quick interest that partly
banished his nervousness.
“I am,” Mr. Garry admitted. “An’ I’ve
been worried —I mean, I couldn’t make
out”
“Of course, you couldn’t,” she broke in.
“I must apologise, Mr. Garry. It was all
Horry’s fault. You see, we were after
horses that day, an’ mine turned turtle an’
left me stunned. We were to have met in
front of your place. Horry came along with
my horse while you were away, an’, having
a restless mob on the fence, he would have
me get on at once an’ go with him. lie
said he’d be round again ; an’ I only found
out this week that he never went near you.
What must you have thought of me?”
“ ’Twarn’t what I thought,” said Don, rue-
fully. “ ’Twas what the neighbors thought.
They got a notion that I was scein’ things
that warn’t there.”
“I’m really sorry,” she said laughing. ‘Sit
down, Mr. Garry, an’ I'll run over the road
an’ get the knife for you.”
Mr. Garry protested vigorously, but Lucy
ran off and purchased one. It cost 7s. 6d.
He had a good one in his pocket, and could
have bought one to suit him for a shilling.
He was a man of simple tastes. But he
managed to look only a little serious at the
extravagance.
He saw her again next morning, when he
bought a packet of matches he didn't want;
and twice during the day, which cost him a
reel of thread and a superfluous necktie;
and yet again that night, when he bought
a tobacco-pouch he had no use for. He
saw her twice more on the following day at
the expense of anew pipe and a pocket-book,
neither of which he wanted, and the
acquaintance was further augmented on the
morning after, at the price of an unnecessary
lead-pencil.
When he called the third night she was
gone. Her brother had come in unexpectedly
with a trap, and she had ridden back with him
to save the steamer fare. Don was so con-
cerned about her casual goings that lie forgot
his ailment, and strode back to his room
without limping.
A brief reflection on the cost of board and
lodging for man and horse gave him the blues.
An overhaul of his finances filled him with
the wmnderlust. He tore off the bandages,
threw his stick under the bed, put liis boot
on, and rode home in the starlight.
For three days he worked on his farm in
a discontented spirit. On the three succeed-
ing days he rode past Barmon’s, looking for
an imaginary horse. Horry met him at the
back, where he was grinding an axe.
“I was wonderin’ if you could sell me a
clutch of duck eggs,” said Don. “Want to
raise some ducks.”
“Sell you a bushel if you want them,”
said Horry.
Don looked rather disappointed, but said
he would be glad to have a dozen. Horry
parcelled them up for him, and he lingered
awhile after paying for them ; but he did not
see Lucy. He was a poor talker and Horry
was busy, so he had to go away with a
double disappointment.
Two days later he called again. Horry
was drawing water with a cask and slide.
“I was wonderin’ if you had a broody hen
to sell,” said Don. “The one I set went
off, an’ if I don’t get another them duck
eggs will spoil.”
Horry sold him a frowsy old thing that
he took a dislike to at once. During the
transaction lie listened and looked about, but
there was no sign of the woman he was hun-
gering to see. He admired the house and
asked how many rooms it contained; and
was chagrined when his friendly interests did
not lead to an invitation to inspect the in-
terior.
“All by yourself?” he finally inquired.
“Yes,”' said Horry shortly.
“Thought you had a sister here?” Don
prompted.
“Lucy? Oh, she lives with the old people,
answered Horry. “On the hill —about two
miles from here.”
Don’s jaw dropped, and he turned tohis horse
with the gravity and deliberation of a koala.
Inwardly he cursed the trouble and expense
he had been put to. On the way home he
cursed the broody hen. He threw her into
a coop and soused a bucket of water over her
to hasten her recovery from broodiness. Ilis
principal concern now was to find an excuse
for calling on the old people. He had never
seen them; and knew nothing about them or
their doings. He conjectured, however, that
they were farmers or selectors.
Eventually he rode out with a cornsack
strapped in front of him. A paling fence
stood close to the back of the premises. He
pulled up there, and an old woman waddled
out to see what he wanted.
“I was told you had some Manhattan spuds
for sale,” he began.
“Whoever could have told you that? asked
the old lady, looking at him curiously.
“A farmer dow r n the river,” said Don, a
little confused.
“I don’t know why he'd tell you that, she
returned, speaking slowly. “We don't, grow
anything here. This is an out-station.”
“I’ve had a long ride for nothing, then,
said Don, who looked more pleased than
otherwise. At the same time he was a little
puzzled. Five youngsters had collected round
the old dame, and stood looking at him with
big, inquisitive eyes.
“You have a healthy family, ma am, he
hazarded.
‘‘They're my grandchildren, she told him.
“My daughter, Lucy, lives with me, though
she ! s away at present looking after a sick
friend. Her husband died when the youngest
was a baby. The other four are two sets of
twins.” .
Don stared at them in consternation. He
was too flabbergasted to poke any further into
the family history. Granny seemed pleased
to have somebody to talk to; but he said he
would have to try somewhere else for those
spuds, and rode away in a deeply-dejected
mood. In the circumstances, he was not
sorry he had not seen Lucy. The revelation
concerning her had been too much for lum,
and he wanted time to think about it and
recover from the shock.
That night he lay awake for hours, tor-
mented bv thoughts that revolved around two
sets of twins; and next day he worked
mechanically and forgot to water the broody
lien. He found himself speculating on the
possibility that the grandmother would adopt
the two sets of twins. There would be room
for the youngest if he put a skillion on the
hut. Then he shook himself as if to dis-
miss the whole subject.
For all that, he had decided to improve
the place for his own convenience. He was
splitting slabs in the neighboring bush for
that purpose, while he tried to picture what
it would be like to change suddenly from
an old bachelor to a father of a numerous
family. After partly bursting a tough gum-
log, lie sat on it to ponder over the complexi-
ties. A moment afterwards two wedges that
he had double-banked flew out. and the rent
log snapped together like a clam-shell. The
severe pinch it gave him made him jump,
but he could not get away. He was wearing
slop trousers, three sizes too large, that he
had bought from a hawker, and the log had
gripped a huge fold of the seat. His in-
voluntary leap split them across above the
fold. To save any further disaster, lie kicked
off his boots, and was about to lift himself
out of the imprisoning garment, when he
was horrified to observe Lucy and one of her
eldest twin daughters riding towards him.
They were mustering horses again.
Don cursed the fate that had brought her
there at such a moment. If his clothing had
been intact lie could have explained his pre-
dicament, and she might have driven in a
wedge and released him. The little adven-
ture would have improved their acquaintance.
She would have considered it a pleasant
service to render in return for what he had
done for her. There were great possibili-
ties in such an experience as that. In the
delicate circumstances, however, he could
only pull down the back of the gaping gar-
ment and sit straight, so that she would not
notice that there was anything wrong.
She rode up briskly, her face smiling and
radiant, and greeted him warmly. He had
never seen her look so well. Smart gallop-
ing through the bush had put a color in
her cheeks, a sparkle in her eyes. But there
was no warmth or pleasure in his welcome.
He was too nervously uncomfortable; and
some exploring ants that had found the
breach in the rear were not improving the
situation. She noticed his constrained man-
ner and the smiles slowly died on her lips.
*“I wanted you to fix my saddlecloth. Mr.
Garry,” she said. “It’s slipped back.”
Garry looked stupidly at the saddlecloth
and squirmed and fidgeted. What the devil
was he to say?
“If you’ll help me off,” she added, prepar-
ing to dismount, “it won’t take you a
minute.”
Mr. Garry wriggled again, and feebly
waved his useless legs. “My foot has gone
back on me,” he said in excuse. “I can’t
stand on it.”
Slie gazed at his feet rather coldly.
“How do you propose to get home?” she
asked him.
“I’m expectin’ a man along directly with
a slide,” lie answered, glancing uneasily to-
wards the hut.
She slipped off her horse without further
parley and adjusted the saddlecloth herself,
whilst Don winced from ant-nips and sim-
mered in the bitterness of his soul. It was
hard, after all the desperate efforts he had
made to see her, to be igndminiously trapped
and put out of action by a blasted log when
she had come to him. She was apparently
offended by his discouraging manner. He
was not an artist at dissembling; his dis-
comfiture was as plain as his feet.
She led her horse to the log to get on
again, while Don placed bis hands down on
each side of him and sat straighter. The
fair rider seemed to have straightened too.
The sunny face had clouded, and there
was a haughty look about the way she held
her head.
As soon as she had mounted she bade him
a frigid good-bye and cantered off. Shortly
afterwards he noticed that she had left her
whip on the log. 11 is first impulse was to
call her back, but the thought that she would
expect him to hand it up to her restrained
him.
He watched her till she had gone a good
distance through the timber; then he dragged
himself out of the offending garment and
was standing in his shirt, viciously driving
in a wedge to free it, when he heard the beats
of galloping hoofs. One startled look was
enough; it was Lucy riding back for her
whip.
Snatching his trousers from the log he rail
for hig life.
