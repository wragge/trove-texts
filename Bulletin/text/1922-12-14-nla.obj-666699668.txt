"Australian University Verse” (an Under-
graduate Anthology), with an introduction by
J. lie Gay Brereton.
(Published by the Universities of Australia.)
According to the preface “This volume is
published in the belief that some of the
verse written by Australian undergraduates
will be of interest to the general reader.”
In that belief the publishers are certainly
justified. The little volume does credit to
the student poets whose work is here repre-
sented ; and though it contains no poem of
outstanding merit, there is infinite promise
in the fact that more than 20 young writers
between the years 1920 and 1922 were far
on the way to a mastery of the instrument
of verse by which they can gain a fuller
measure of self-expression. The final selec-
tion of the work was made by E. 11. C.
Oliphant, and, with one exception, all the
pieces chosen show at least a measure of
craftsmanship which makes them worthy of
inclusion. Beyond all doubt Professor Brere-
ton is right when he suggests that some of
the writers are likely to be heard of for a
long time in our growing national literature.
But the book is one of promise rather
than achievement; and the verses, though in
few cases crude, are obviously very young.
This is not so' much observable in the man-
ner as in the matter and the thought behind
it. Every writer covers well-trodden
ground, and the reader might possibly prefer
a little more crudity with a little more
freshness. Here is a sonnet by Boyd
Coutts—probably the best sonnet in the
book: —
Upon the mountains lost in gathering blue
The sunlight turned from siege of shade and bower.
Pale was the sky from marvel of the hour
When earth is washed with quietness anew.
Like pagan battlements the peaks upthrew
Their ancient earthworks, where a soulless power.
Some Demogorgon, woke in every tower —
And in the midst of this I thought of you.
I could not see the shadows long that stole
Like silent sentries ’neath the moon to keep
A voiceless. vigil, could not see unroll
The ipystie tracings of the sky’s bare scroll;
I felt the deathly chill of that great steep
Shudder along the ramparts of your soul.
That is both strong and good, though all the
mountain imagery has been used before and
used rather often. Still, the last line shows
the sure, firm hand and touches something of
vague but real emotion. The same writer
in “Youth,” from the Chinese of Lee Beh,
strikes about the freshest note in the
volume: —•
The careless gallants of Ooling
Hide forth caparisoned in Spring
With silver saddles, horses white,
And dainty garments "fluttering.
Soon in the golden market-places,
They crush the flowers with heedless paces,
And pledge in ardent w r ine the eyes
Of Tartar girls with merry faces.
Very slight that, but with the dew on it.
Another translation, from the Chinese of
Too Foo, might have been almost as good
but for the awful attempt to rhyme “arm”
with “calm.”
Bobert D. Fitzgerald is represented by
three pieces; but he has already far sur-
passed these in his more recent work, and
should go on to do still better. Ross Fran-
cis Collan has a sonnet on “Beading Keats,”
which has atmosphere, but is marred by the
repetition of a word. I. F. Jones sings a
little hoarsely, but with some force, of the
devils of “Neurasthenia,” and Catherine
McLaurin is represented by five pieces which
are all good in their way, but a little imi-
tative in theme. Of these “Lament” has
real emotion and gains its effect in the
simplest possible way.
Jack Lindsay, in “The Chase,” paints a
good picture, but does so in a manner that
is almost wholly imitative of Hugh McCrae’s
“Colombine.” The theme is practically the
same, though amplified and extended and
with a suggestion of crude passion. Colom-
bine, light as the feathers of dreams, fades
out to the music of ’cellos. Lindsay’s larger
and less, ethereal lady leans backward to her
lover while the “violins sink softly, strok-
ingly.” There is good music of a kind in
“The Chase.” In “Dismissal,” a sonnet,
Lindsay’s work is again very good; but the
idea of the lover, who must find his mistress
still in every place where she has been,
has worked hard for other poets. The
dash in the fourth line of the sestet appears
to be a misprint for a hyphen. The sonnet
which follows is stronger in thought and
equally good in workmanship, but it is not
very convincing. The lover who pauses before
winning his lady to consider whether con-
stancy of passion or after-disgust would be
the result of her yielding, should be not less
than 80 years of age. Lindsay knows the
value of rich phrasing, but has yet to learn
more of the delicacy of word values and word
music. The line —
Of fiery feet across deep infinite skies,
jars heavily in the repetition of the vowel
sound ; and
Bide ever while untransient passion covers
is all that a sonnet line ought not to be.
I. R. Maxwell writes good vcjrse that has
plenty of color and some music,nut his note
can hardly be said to be distinctive. The
last stanza of his “Gallipoli” would be
notable if things so very like it had not
been written before :—•
Only above u s the wraith of a wind-tossed banner
Towers to the quiet sky.
We are the dead whose dust is the dust of England—
The dead who may not die.
It is rather a straining of language to speak
of a banner towering. Raymond H. McGrath
has a highly-colored set of “Dreams of the
Orient,” which are pleasing and would be
more so but for the use of unusual and seem-
ingly meaningless words. Thus the reader is
puzzled by
Out of its dust I wing the fretful sea.
Does this mean give wings to the sea, shoot
the sea in the wing, or chase the sea away
on wings from the dust? Richard Meredith
is content to shape his verses to small clever-
nesses, but the manner of the lines is good
enough to make them fit for higher uses. R.
J'oundy has a good idea in “Mystery,” but
his “Nocturne” is his best contribution. Here
again, in manner, though not in matter, tier®
would appear to be an echo of “Colombine.
Take the opening stanza :•> —
Somewhere a violin,
Plangent and sweet and thin.
Trembles caressingly,
Sets the strange heart of me
Wondering, wondering.
Now listen to Hugh McOrae :
Faint through the fluttering
Fall of a flute divine
Softly the ’cellos sing
Colombine, Colombine.
R. S. Ellery has a striking, if rather ex-
travagant sonnet on Oscar Wilde, in which he
says:—•
Thou in whom lovely Sappho lived again,
And sang her songs with re-born ecstasy.
It seems rather hard on the little school-
mistress of Mitylene ; but it is at least daring.
Good as the collection of verse is when
judged as a series of trial flights, the hints of
real inspiration are ' not very frequent, and
there is no very keen general sense of the
magic of words; but the love Of singing is
there, and there is a very Considerable
mastery of the instruments of song. Those
are foundations upon which all the rest may
be built.
A Hospital Epic
The Prince of Beggars, by Neville Dang-
ton (Hutchinson and. Go., London), is a
record of the wonderful work done by Lord
Knutsford, chairman of the London Hospi-
tal, in raising £1,000,000 for that institu-
tion. Million-making is always a feat, but
to make a million sterling by begging is
unique. Lord Knutsford was born into the
world Sydney Holland. Before interesting
himself in the “London” he practised in the
Devil’s Brigade, became a director of the
E. and W. India Dock Company, of a bank
and of a railway, and was a founder of
the first Coffee Tavern Company. In these
various roles he had more than a bowing
acquaintance with the East End. His in-
terest in the London Hospital began in 1891
as the result of an accident —to an employee.
He went to the Poplar Hospital to. see. this
man. He came away and wrote in his diary:
“I do not know anything about hospitals,
but there is something seriously wrong with
this one.” In June of that year, in his
capacity of Dock director, he presided at
the annual meeting of the hospital. A work-
ing men’s committee attended to turn out the
hospital committee. Holland, as he then was,
offered to inquire into conditions, and found
them beyond belief. The committee chal-
lenged him to put them right, and he took
up the challenge. Within a fortnight the
entire staff had been sacked and a new one
installed. Then he began to increase the
accommodation. The hospital had only 36
beds, and no funds. The begging campaign
began. In a year the hospital had been re-
built with 103 beds at a cost of £70,000;
£54,000 put to reserve, and an income of
£15,000 assured. Since then it has never
been in debt.
In 1896, on the advice of Miss
Luckes, the matron of the “London,”
Sydney Holland stood for the commit-
tee of that institution and Avas elected.
As a result of a report he drafted he became
chairman in December of that year. From
1896 to 1919, when Miss Luckes died, the
greatest hospital administrator and the great-
est nursing organiser of our time worked
hand in hand to make the “London” the best,
as it already was the largest, hospital in
England. Its progress was vital to the East
End. Two million people depended upon
it. Its needs were imperative; its
deficit perennial—£23,ooo per annum. Its
regeneration required a crusader, and Hol-
land became one. This bookJs in part the
record of that work, but in particular it is
the record of the begging that made that work
successful. Incidentally, it is a handbook of
ffßßritable appeal. The pulling values of
newspapers, letters, fetes and stunts of every
kind are weighed and judged.; and, in addi-
tion, there is a vast fund of humor and
pathos in these pages—and of practical wis-
dom. The author Avas head of the “Lon-
don’s” Begging Department. No monument
other than the rebuilt hospital is needed to
perpetuate his chief’s Avork —Si monumen-
turn requiris. circumspice. From 1896 to
1920 £700,000 was collected for rebuilding
and building; £430,000 added to capital
account; and £1,528,000 raised, for mainten-
ance. In-patients’ practice has risen from
10,000 to 23,000 per annum, and during that
period 11,824,215 out-patients were treated.
What greater thing can one man give the
world than a charitable institution of such
magnitude ?
Concerning the Defacement
of Books
I have a respect for every kind of prose
contained between the boards of-a book, be it
good, bad or indifferent, and my gorge rises
when I handle a library book which has
been defaced by the pencil of a vandal. _ I
believe in borrowed books being treated with
care and tenderness—with as much care, in
fact, as one accords a bed of beautiful flowers.
I would no more deface a book that wasn’t
my own, with marginal notes, queries, and ex-
clamation marks, or presume to correct the
spelling and grammar, than I would neglect
to pay my doctor’s bill, which, next to my
prayers, 1 consider my most sacred obliga-
tion. I have the same reverent affection to-
wards prose that the poet Matthew Prior
held towards verse, and his childlike belief
that nothing could possibly be bad in poetry,
I dm content to admire. That was his con-
sidered verdict, not one made up on the
spur of the moment, or after a period of
exhilaration due to drinking Swift’s prime
Monte Polciano, which came straight from
the vineyards of the Grand Duke of Tus-
cany Prior butt of the wits for
holding this fanciful opinion, but he was
true to his colors, and on hearing that a
certain epic poem, running into 8000 lines,
was so intolerably dull as to be unreadable,
he cheerfully said he would read every word
of it, and was sure, he would find something
of rare poetic value in it. I have a horror
of every marginal', scribbler unless he is

THE sentiment back of Gift-giving is to provide something
appropriate that expresses joy and admiration in the
heart of the recipient.
Electrical Goods are decidedly acceptable. They cover a
flexible field, and all tastes can be accommodated.
Give a thought to Electrical Goods this Christmas, and avoid
likelihood of duplication of, perhaps, something “pretty” but
of no service.
An Electrical Gift of utility, attractive and artistic, is a remem-
brancer that imparts dignity to the particular function for
which it is used.
Everything Electrical means more recreation, less fatigue.

GENUINE BALATA BELTING.
If a scrupulous search were made
in your power-plant you would
possibly find that a good deal of
the power generated is being lost
through faulty transmission. The
use of a speed indicator will fur-
nish you with undeniable evidence
that DICK’S Original Balata Belt-
ing delivers its full quota of
power, consistently, year in and
year out.
The accidents that happen to the
average belt—sudden breakdowns,
stretching, shrinking or slipping—are
unknown to DICK’S Original Balata
Belting. It efficiently overcomes the
most abnormal conditions of service.
Every thread of the belt is scientifi-
cally treated with Waterproof balata
gum, rendering it impervious to condi-
tions of dampness, heat, steam, dust,
etc. Its long life and absolute effici-
ency make it the cheapest-per-year
belting on the Australian market.

qualified for the task like S.T.C. —and where
would one find his like nowadays?
I read a political brochure, the other day,
belonging to a library, and found it muti-
lated from beginning to end —revised,
amended and otherwise desecrated, the
heavily-scored “Ha-ha’s!” having the same
Significance as those of the Scriptural war-
horses that smelt the battle from afar. The
vandal responsible was a Labor man, evidently
—an extremist, probably an I.YV.W. —this
I could tell by the weight of his fist on the
emendatory pencil. I know it took me a
full hour to erase his excrescences, and re-
store the volume to a semblance of nor-
mality. I suspected a truculent scribe who
wields a pen, like a shovel, on one of our Syd-
ney papers, but he gazed unblinkingly at the
book when it was opened suddenly in his face
at the most offensive passages, and with per-
fect sang-froid remarked, after examining a
few selections, that he agreed with some of
the statements. Other mutilators, less
openly Bolshevistic, are content to add an
occasional “Bosh!” “What rot!” “Silly ass!”
to the ensemble, and others, again, alter the
spelling and grammar, and rope off passages
that appeal to them with zigzag lines, the
latter brand being a perfect plague at libra-
ries.
Most of the scribblers who in past
times considered that they had made
celebrated books immortal by condescending
to enrich them with marginal notes, and
whose copies were preserved with the great-
est care in the British Museum, have been
found to be impostors when their annota-
tions were subjected to close scrutiny by
historical experts. For instance, the copies
of Anthony Hamilton’s “Memoires du Comte
de Gramont,” which had belonged to the
Rev. John Mitford and Sir William Mus-
grave and were copiously annotated by
them, were found to be worthless from an
historical point of view. The only borrower
I know of who really enriched books with
his notes was S.T.C., and well Charles
Lamb, whose treasures were often subjected
to. this treatment, knew it, and he wished
that all his books were so noted ; but even
his enthusiasm w r as damped at times, for on
one occasion Coleridge certainly did not en-
rich Lamb’s prized edition of “Beaumont and
Fletcher” (in folio, of course), but left a
few lines more suggestive of the visit of the
undertaker. They ran : “Midnight. God bless
you, dear Charles Lamb. I am dying. I
feel I have not many weeks left.” The note
scared Lamb out of his wits, but such exhi-
bitions were frequent with Coleridge, and
were due to opium.
Borrowers illtreat books in a variety
of ways by dog-earing them every time
they put them down," or by folding a
page in two when tram tickets, or
old envelopes, are not handy. They throw
books down anywhere, maltreat them hor-
ribly, and often return them stained with
coffee, cigar ash and tobacco. Even the
tender-hearted Lamb was careless with
books; but he had the excuse that they were
his own. He often traced a missing volume
by the fragments of Gloucester blackened
over a candle (at times, his only supper)
and the flakes of tobacco that were left in
it. How offensive it is to one’s aesthetic
sense to see a book lying with a handker-
chief stuffed in its vitals to serve as a book-
mark, or sprawling face downward over a
chair or couch, looking as bizarre and life-
less as a marine animal that has been
washed up high and dry by the tide.
Notwithstanding the generosity with
which insurance and other companies distri-
bute, gratis, attractive bookmarks by the
thousand where books are in demand, it is
amusing and pathetic to note the straits to
which readers are reduced when a book has
to be temporarily abandoned. One finds an
amazing collection of toilet articles in re-
turned books, hairpins, hairnets and bits of
thread predominating; but occasionally a
safety-pin is boldly thrust through a very
special page. One is often placed on a
familiar footing in a household, and intro-
duced to the secrets of the boudoir, and the
menage, by the discovery of love-letters, or
letters containing risque stories, bills (mostly
unpaid), doctors’ prescriptions and grocery
lists, and orders for the butcher stuck be-
tween the pages of a diverting “sex” novel.
Apparently there is no limit to the articles
used as bookmarks by the women of to-dav :
“Marthas of the careful soul, and the
troubled heart,” i.e., worried housekeepers,
and no rtieans of inducing people to be more
indulgent towards books they don’t own.
L. G. D.
„Distinctively Australian”
To my mind Adrian Lawlor plucks out the
heart of this topic in “Our Own Voices” (B.
23,/11/’22). D. M. Wright, in a previous con-
troversy with me on the subject of tradition in
Australian Letters, claimed that “all English
tradition is ours by right of race.” I claim
—and this is, roughly, the conclusion ex-
pressed by Adrian Lawlor—that the English
tradition is ours, but that we may so modify
its form as to produce a highly characteristic
Australian literature. I am all for a tradi-
tion in Australian Letters. Until we have
the cult that goes with it we shall not pro-
duce our best work. Bu£ it should be a
tradition so strongly characteristic of this
country and its people’s outlook that, though
it must have taken its rise in English Letters,
it will be recognised by Englishmen as “dis-
tinctively Australian.”
That was a phrase much in the mouths of
the English during the war. They showed
a generous admiration for Australian tem-
perament and character. Most Australians
are under a delusion that it was an admira-
tion for our physical bearing, efficiency in the
field, or mental directness. They think of
Masefield’s idealised praise of the
type on Gallipoli: “They moved over the
ridges of Anzac like eagles freshly bathed” ;
and “They died as they had lived —owning no
master.” They think of E. B. Osborn’s
panegyric in the Morning Post : “The other
day I was walking and talking with a famous
art critic, who commented on the close re-
semblance, in face and form, of the Austra-
lian fighting men we met to certain Greek
marbles. Of course the ancient Greeks were
not, as most people imagine, a race of elegant
moralists, posing on temple steps in carefully-
draped white sheets. In the mass they were
bronzed, adventurous fellows, excitable and
not given to saluting, terribly fond of fight-
ing and drinking and robust flirtation, com-
bining a huge zest in joyous living with a
streak of pessimism, dour and indefatigable in
their sports, such lovers of roving that the
whole earth became their tomb, eager for the
new, in hopes of discovering something new,
democrats among themselves, but an aris-
tocracy towards snuff-and-butter barbarians
.... always and altogether free from the
slightest taint of respectability.... Indeed, it
somehow sticks in my mind that the Austra-
lians who fought on Gallipoli were cousins
(albeit 30 centuries and 15,000 miles re-
moved) to the Homeric heroes who struggled
on the ringing plains of Troy to recover the
wonder-woman who is perhaps a poetic sym-
bol of free access to the Black Sea markets.”
But there is more than this admiration of
Australian bodies and temperament in Eng-
lish praise. Osborn goes on to say: “If
the Greeks had left us songs and lays of
pioneering and the founding of cities afar
on every shore of the known world, we
should find in them much that resembles
the poems of the Australian realists, the
first truly Australian poets.” And whilst
I was in England reclining in that delect-
able leisure known as non-military employ-
ment, I was commissioned by the Man-
chester Guardian to furnish an article on
Australian verse, “illustrated, if possible,
from that very virile body of verse which
appears from time to time in The Bulle-
tin.” This all suggests that England
realises “we must evolve an idiom ; we must
express ourselves in our own tongue and
in our own terms.” England is further pre-
pared to apply to Australian work that con-
summate fairness of literary judgment which
Adrian Lawlor looks for when he says : “Our
critics, if they are to be of any service, must
be disposed to give that idiom and those
terms a downright welcome.”
“D.M.W.” emphasises the “change in the
color of our environment.” That is the
modifying power which is going to trans-
form the English tradition into something
Antipodean. This is an English critic who
speaks: “It is to Australia rather than to
Canada thpt we must look for new poets of
the first magnitude. Canada is old enough
now to have given birth to poetic genius. Yet
so far she has brought forth only singers and
verse-makers of talent and distinction —such
as Lampman and Bliss Carman, Frechette
and Nelligan, whose bravest work is rooted in
the imitation of Old World models. Aus-
tralia, unlike Canada, provides a sensuous
environment, somewhat resembling that of
ancient Hellas, in which all the emotional
arts —singing, dancing, painting, and poetry
above all —must sooner or later flourish
luxuriously.”
We have long passed that stage when those
dwellers in Australia who thought instinc-
tively of England as Home were in a
majority. This continent has already re-
moulded its own type of mind and body—
even of diction. Can you conceive a sharper
contrast with the Englishman in tempera-
ment and physical bearing than the Aus-
tralian offers? I can’t. It is not extrava-
gant to expect that, later on, there will be
as sharp a differentiation between their types
of literature. This will necessarily come
more slowly. Australia has not yet had
time or leisure to give to Letters that energy
and concentration which will stabilise them
into a cult. We have been too distracted
getting ourselves settled, fighting for a crust,
gaining a foothold in virgin land and found ; ng
cities to settle down to Letters. But the
time will come when the habit of literary
activity will be achieved, too. We have the
will and the faculty to write. It is signifi-
cant that much more than half the contribu-
tion offered to the A.I.F. paper published
in the Field was in verse. Needless to say,
it wasn’t all published. But it is expressive
that verse is the form to which the un-
sophisticated (and often the uneducated)
Digger was drawn for self-expression. If
that is our instinct as a race, the Imperial
seat of literary production may yet shift
from England to this New Atlantis in the
Pacific.
HECTOR DINNING.
A Satchel of Books
The Squatter’s Daughter, by Hilda M. Bridges
(Bookstall series), is a re-hash of the rioe old melo-
drama of the same name. The ingredients consist
of the usual squatter, a blackguard, a noble young
overseer, the squatter’s son, changed in the cradle
with the blackguard aforesaid, a lovely girl perse-
cuted by the blackguard, the hero bound to rock
beneath waterfall bv bushrangers, heroine captured
by bushrangers, lots of bushrangers everywhere
several rescues and a wedding.
A Colt from the■ Country adds another thriller
to Arthur Wright’s Bookstall Series’ successes. It
begins and ends in the surf at Manly, touching en
route the iniquities of Freshwater “ bungalow-life,
Rosehill, opium smuggling and Sydney crooks in a
well-connected and exciting yarn which is full of
local color.
The Man Who Could Not See. by Mrs. Fred Rey-
nolds (John Lane, the Bodley Head). An exceed-
ingly sentimental story of a blinded soldier who
marries an ugly woman with a beautiful nature, and
recovers his sight soon afterwards. He then leaves
with her prettiest girl friend, the wife being
too high-minded to protest. The betrayers, being
both extremely vain and selfish, disagree," and sepa-
rate ; the husband becomes a drug-fiend, returns
home later to be cured by his wife, and subsequently
emerges a wiser and a happier man.
My Lady’s Bargain, by Elizabeth Hope (Nisbett
and Co.). A decorous romance of the Commonwealth
with a noble Roundhead, the blacksmith’s son, who
dares to cast eyes at the lord’s daughter, and, having
won her by the doubtful use of Cromwell’s power,
proves himself a worthy gentleman by returning the
keys of her bedroom to her. The novel then becomes
one of that widely popular type, in which two lovers
are put in juxtaposition with the closed door between,
and the feminine readers are thrilled in wondering
how long it will stay like that. R. L. .Stevenson,
in “Catriona,” started this style of cheap excitation!
For the rest, a mysterious footman, Cromwell’s w’art,
a ride through the night and the wrong woman
after all.
Turkey Bowman, by Homer Croy (Harper and
Brothers), is a much better book than it is painted
by its cover, which shows the correctly reckless
cowboy rescuing a girl from beneath the very hooves
of the charging cattle. It is the story of a boy in
one of the early U.S. townships touching on "the
Indian territory, and it has excellent touches of
child-psychology. The description of the hero’s rivalry
with Hoot Howden for the fair Addie, and of their
various attempts to catch her attention by noble
deeds, varying from sticking a pin through "a wart
to showing how far they can spit, is admirably real
and humorous. When Turkey, after an unsuccessful
effort to serenade Addie, runs away from the town
with no luggage save a chemise, stolen from his
beloved’s line—a garment which turns out after-
wards to have been her sister’s—the story becomes
more ordinary, and talking dogs, raids, scalping,
Indian revolts, prehistoric bones, etc., flash past
somewhat too quickly, relieved a little bv genuine
realisations 0 f a boy’s mind. Turkey all through
has been longing for a sword, and when the scientist
picks up one of the discovered bones, it seems to the
boy that he raises it as carefully as if it had been
“a gold sword.” Finally, he covers himself with
glory and returns to his home, with the sword of
his dreams in his possession, and is welcomed by a
brass band.
The Armfields’ Animal Book (Duckworth and Co.).
Another young people’s gift book with an octet of
stories such as “How the Turtles Learned to Differ,”
“How the Camels Unbent,” and “How the Bittern
Boomed,” by Constance Smedley Armfleld, each with
a decorative illustration in color by Maxwell Ann-
field. A well-got-up volume; but the letterpress is
perhaps a little staid for the youthful mind. The
thing has been done better before.
The author of The Voiceless Victims (The Aus-
tralasian Publishing Co.) writes under two names.
He does his more ambitious work as Guy Thorne:
in lighter or more careless mood, he is Ranger
Gull. He has imagination, and an odd leaning to-
wards the horrible, which he usually manages to
mix up with some religious or ethical question. “The
Oven” was about cannibalism in a quiet Knglish
village; “When it Was Dark” treated of a period
during which the world was forced to disbelieve in
Christianity; he has even managed to write a thrill-
ing novel round freemasonry. This is one of the
Guy Thorne series, and it is about the cruelty prac-
tised on animals _ which are trained to perform in
circuses and music-halls. It is a pity, if anything
even remotely like what he describes really does
go on, that he did not expose it in a more convincing
book. The characters have no life in them: they
are conventional figures, all of whom we have met
in more vital forms elsewhere. There is a villain-
ous fat foreigner—suave, polished, a lover of trees
and flowers, in whose presence animals are cowed
and honest Knglish folks shudder and experi-
ence a sensation of nausea. This creation was inter-
esting when Wilkie Collins presented him first in
“The Woman in White,” but he has been overdone
of recent years, and by no writer more than Mr.
Thorne. The hero is wooden, and the heroine is of
the same material, and the deu.s ex machine, Colonel
Bullingdon, V.C., D. 5.0., etc., is an automaton. As
in all Mr. Thorne’s books there is a stirring plot
which moves at a tremendous pace to an exciting
climax. A queer inconsistency by the way, in this
little circle of passionate animal lovers—animals are,
of course, the “voiceless victims” referred to in
the title —is Bernard Boyne, the hero, with his love
of trout-fishing, and his appreciation of the struggles
of a two-pounder. It raises the old controversy:
“Can fish feel”? But then the author had to sacri-
fice either the unities or his plot, for the whole
business turns on a marvellous casting feat by
Bernard.
Rogues’ Haven, by Roy Bridges (Hodder and
Stoughton). This story, originally published in
Britain and now issued in an American edition, is
another fine performance by this prolific Australian
author. In fact, it is on the same literary
level as “The Black House,” which reminded
several reviewers of Stevenson in his most
adventurous vein. From the first chapter, where-
in the two boys, Howe and Vining, make the
acquaintance of the impressive Mr. Bradbury, the
present yarn spins on without any straining for
superlatively sensational effects. Characterisation,
which is so shining a feature of Bridges’s talent, is
here again significant in his achievement. The fluent
English, which never loses its strength and clarity,
is also a pleasure to read.
A Treatise on Landscape Painting in Water Colors,
by David Cox. The special autumn number of This
Studio, and, like all volumes from that house, admir-
ably produced. Cox, who was born in 1783, pub-
lished his treatise over a century ago, and, though
he said all he had to say in a few pages and in no
sense produced a manual of painting, what principles
he did lay down were sound enough. There are 72
plates, giving examples of “outline, effect and color-
mg, which constitute the main interest in the pre-
sent volume, showing as they do how the old-timer
got his effects. There is a quaint stiffness about
certain aspects of his work —he often falls down
badly over foliage—but even the slick student of
to-day has something to learn from him, particularly
ln the matter of handling colors.
The Inky Way
S.l.S.Vernon Knowles, a young Adelaide liter-
ary man, just back from England, gives the Register
(18/11/’22) his impressions of Chesterton and Mase-
field as seen in their own homes. The big man is
“not so large as he is painted. True, be is im-
mense ; but he is very tall, and carries his weight
well.” His chief rememberable remark was that
“Color is God’s greatest gift to man” —he had been
talking of scarlet, and the movement for brighten-
ing up London. Masefield spoke of the times when
he was penniless and despairing, and “every paper
in London rejected my things.” He betrayed the
most naive ignorance of Australian literature. “He
had never heard of Bernard O’Dowd, or of Professor
Walter Murdoch, who brought out the last Oxford
book of Australian Verse. This was rather a blow
to me, and he acknowledged his ignorance of Aus-
tralian poets and writers to be without excuse. He
went on that he had a theory that it is natural in
a new country for the men to give all their days
to work, and thus, for some time, to have no leisure
in which to write; meanwhile, the womenfolk car-
ried on with the writing. All the best Australian
verse and novels he had read, he said, had been
written by women.”
“S.T.S.”: Seems to me that Bulletin writers are
making an unnecessary fuss about the quality of
the verse of the late G. R. Sims. For these reasons;
(1) He made no fuss about it himself; in fact, he
seemed genuinely amused when, about 15 years back,
a London pressman who reckoned that Britain had
70 minor poets included the name of Sims in the long
list. (2) He had, nevertheless, an enviable gift of
turning out pleasant verse. In all the 40-odd years
of his “Mustard and Cress” for the Referee, there
would be three or four such poemlets included in
his three columns every week. They had their pass-
ing interest, and no pretence was made that they
had more by reprinting them. All the same, one
trifle, “The Lights of London Town” —no connection
with his melodrama of similar name—became a popu-
lar song, and lingers pleasantly in the memory still.
(3) The well-known Dagonet Ballads were written
solely for recitation, and are to be judged by that
lenient standard only. To come nearer home, would
the superior critics wipe out of existence “How
McDougall Topped the Score,” and all such things,
comic or sentimental? Greater men have been
guilty of them. “And the terrified spectator flees
like blazes to the pub” may not be poetry at all,
but we don’t want to lose the story; nor yet that
other containing the awful mouthful of a line, “And
gave Abdelkader at Aintree nine pounds.” They
are just a medium for the art of the elocutionist,
and as such—though only as such—have their dis-
tinct value.
“J.H.” (London): The bottom is beginning to fall
out of the Newspaper Insurance stunt, most of the
newspapers who took it up having already
received notice from the insurance companies that
the existing contracts will not be renewed under any
circumstances. The companies have been snowed
under with bogus claims, and find their expense rate
in consequence swollen out of all reason. Being
thus “fed up,” .they are naturally scanning very
closely the conditions of their policies, and the
policy-holders are finding that the risks, against which
they imagined themselves insured, are not unlimited.
Claimants with grievances naturally have a grouse
against the newspaper to which they subscribed on
the strength of its loudly-advertised philanthropy.
And so British journalism is having its first experi-
ence of an imperilled credit, and finds it unpleasant.
One consequence is that a number of the bright
young men in the “Ideas” department of the Daily
Mail, where the stunt is supposed to have originated,
are feeling far from happy—the more so since
Rothermere, reputed to be the business brains of the
Northcliffe enterprises, has assumed control of things.

COMOX (Oxy-Acetylene) WELDING
renders timely aid to art in the
production of Synthetic Statuary.
WHEN it’s a matter of delicate work and perfect alignment
and adjustment, Comox can be relied upon to build up
or reunite metal parts with the same high speed and
precision as it handles an ordinary repair. The making of this
bronze statue is a case in point.
The founders could not produce this statue in metal, except in
sections, and there remained to find a means of uniting those
sections without flaw or blemish. Comox did the work. The
37 separate pieces were united into the original figure of the
artist’s imagination. The statue now stands an everlasting
memorial to the “Diggers” of Leichhardt, N.S.W., and the
power of the Comox Blowpipe.
There is profitable employment for Comox wherever metal is
cut or joined. ComoX speeds up the making of metal goods.
It makes a stronger, better article for lower cost. It cleans and
reconditions foundry castings in minutes that are hours by other
means.
Damage to machine and engine parts cannot cause costly
holdups and disorganised production when Comox is handy.
The Comox Blowpipe quickly puts all broken metal parts in
service again, for a fraction of the cost of replacement. Write
our nearest address for particulars of Comox Welding and
Cutting Outfits, or the address of your nearest Comox Welder.

Summer Song.
There is a track that lovers know:
It winds across a sunny hill,
Where budding things wait, hushed and
still,
For Summer's coming on tiptoe
Among the eucalyptus-trees,
And tiny dies and midges drift
Like clouds of gold dust in the heat,
The gum-bloom scent is honey-sweet,
And minarets of pink heath lift
Their frail spires to the seeking bees.
The gully is awake with notes
Of calling birds, and in the earth
Seed life is stirring, waiting birth.
And dragon-flies, like blue-sailed boats.
Dream on the sunshine-dappled creek,
Up through the bracken’s filigree,
Like incense come the warm earth smells,
And in pale, tender leaves there swells
A tremulous expectancy
Of sweet unfolding, all this week.
And wattle like pale sunshine dings
Her golden patch-work on the grass,
And as the soft winds gently pass
They whisper little happy things
That make the new November glad,
The white clouds move like docks of sheep
Upon the blue plain of the skies,
The world is fair to youthful eyes,
And only wise age craves for sleep,
And only mateless things are sad.

Love in Summer.
Because of you we’re glad to-day.
Summer and I ; for who can say
How soon old dreams shall all come true?
Meanwhile, .Toy’s here, and every way
Gold day laughs sheer across the blue —
Because of you.
Erst, love, scarce could I sing one song,
But Sorrow set the music wrong
With dreary discord breaking through
Each plangent cadence sweet and strong—
But now my songs are happy too,
Because of you.
The sea is bluer than your eyes ;
An arch of sapphire flame the skies.
Love makes our whole glad world anew,
With all the loveliness that lies
In passion’s flower o’ dreams that grew
Because of you.

J. HOLLOWAY.
The World’s Task.
I am idling ’neath a tree,
’Neath a. pine beside the sea,
With a tall ship in the offing, flag afloat and
sails unfurled,
■Setting seaward with the.breeze;
But I cannot be at ease
With the quiet skies above me;
Being restless with the restlessness that’s
surging through the world.
Lacking sometimes bite and sup,
Cheer of hearth and cheer of cup,
Men have sought to make life noble, and the
path of men sublime,
Enduring scorn the while,
With a wise, forgiving smile;
But, like sunset glory fading.
Passed the vision that they wrought for in
the measure of their time.
Since some caveman in his cave
Sought to succor, sought to save,
Sought to better those around him, and to
smooth the ways they trod,
Fighting darkness, fighting night,
Loving justice, loving right,
Dreaming dreams of peace unbroken,
Every age has opened windows to let in the
lights of God.
In time’s ruined waste lie strewn
Broken dreams, by toilers hewn
From the quarries of the mind in grey ages
long forgot;
Piling thought on thought, they built
Lofty arch, and temple gilt
With a radiance doomed to perish;
For their arches all have fallen, and their
temples now are not.
Though the world seem grey and old,
Yet its courage grows not cold,
And its hopeful builders build, and its tire-
less hewers hew;
But it has such roads to make,
And such stubborn rocks to break,
Ere ’tis crowned with all-achievement,
That the task, which God has set it, seems
too much for it to do.

THE STRENGTH OF IT.
“‘lt is a crowning feat,’ says Sir Ernest Budge, the keeper of the Egyptian and A ssyrian antiquities at the British Museum, apropos the discovery by the Earl of Carnarvon
last week of Tutankhamen’s tomb. Tutankhamen’s predecessor, Amenhotep the Fourth, revived the old sun worship. He shut himself up and isolated the city, where he burnt
incense and offered sacrifices, while the empire went to ruin. There is scarcely a more pathetic picture in history than this religious fanatic, singing hymns to the god
whom the people .refused to worship.”— SUN cable.
TOURIST: “But why did he make a god of such an abominable object?”
GUIDE: “The people of his day believed that the god gave him the lyre, and that accounted for his devotion.”

A DISASTROUS COMPARISON.
As polling-day approaches, and the electors
make it ever clearer that they well appre-
ciate what the real issue is, the supporters
of the Prime Minister are making truly
heroic efforts to cope with the £25,000 pro-
blem. And inevitably—since this is an affair
which can only be tackled to useful purpose
in one way, namely, on lines of complete
frankness, and since frankness appears to be
barred—the Hughesites are making a poor
fist of the job. » One of the latest to essay
the impossible— i.e., justification without
explanation—was Joseph Carruthers, of
N. S. Wales. At Dapto, the other night, he
attempted to cozen the cockies with this: —
I was a colleague of Henry Parkes for three
years, and know full well that he was worthy of the
name of Australia’s greatest statesman and patriot.
Yet, to the shame of his own countrymen, it could be
said that at times he had not the money to buy
the necessaries of life. On one occasion a friend
called at his home a little before his death, and
found, to his dismay, that there was not even a
loaf of bread in the house nor money to buy it with.
....No public movement was made in his lifetime
to place him and his dependants beyond the suffer-
ings and trials of poverty. Now, when some men
thought it more worthy to honor W. M. Hughes in
his lifetime, and to make him and his family inde-
pendent of public charity, there were cries of
derision from a section that thought it more honor-
able to starve a statesman in his lifetime, and then
on his death to parade his poverty, and debate it on
a vote to assist his family. Personally, I hold that
an open and public testimonial to a man in his life-
time is more honorable than a belated pension or
grant when a man has died amidst the pangs and
anxieties of a poverty that must have always been
gnawing at the man’s heart.
* * * *
What are the known facts? Parkes was
what Hughes is not, and never has been—
a congenital and incorrigible spendthrift in
his private life. While Parkes was in
funds his purse was at the service of anyone
or any cause that came to him for help. Mr.
Hughes has many admirable qualities, but
altruism in money matters is not one of
them. His name does not bulk large—in
fact, usually it does not bulk at all —on the
subscription-lists of public charities; and
he has the reputation of being a hard man
in a business deal. He was a capitalist and
a landlord in the days when he constantly
denounced capitalism and landlordism in
Parliament, at election meetings throughout
the Commonwealth, and in the columns of
the Sydney Telegraph. Parkes would have
ended his career a poor man if he had drawn
a ministerial salary for 11 years out of 12,
as Mr. Hughes has ; and, of course, he never
had such luck. The Prime Minister, who
Carruthers has the effrontery to suggest,
needed, with his family, to be made “inde-
pendent of public charity” and saved from
“starving in his lifetime,” was a rich man
years before he touched a penny of his
mysteriously-provided £25,000. “No public
movement,” says Mr. Hughes’s astonish-
ingly indiscreet apologist, “was made in his
(Parkes’s) lifetime to place him and his de-
pendants beyond the sufferings and trials of
poverty.” But it was. A public meeting
was held at the Sydney Town Hall on Mon-
day,, October 17, 1887, in the course of which
a motion was carried deeply sympathising
with Parkes “in the painful position in
which he had been placed by unfortunate
circumstances.” In plain language, the old
warrior was destitute. The public sub-
scribed £B5OO, and the money was vested
by a committee of nine in three trustees—
“to pay interest, dividends and annual in-
come therefrom to the said Henry Parkes
during his life, or until he shall attempt to
alienate, charge or encumber the same or
any part thereof or become bankrupt.” There
was no mystery about the transaction. Any-
one who wished to know the amounts sub-
scribed was promptly obliged, and if required
the names and addresses of the donors were
supplied as well. In fact, it had the char-
acteristic which Carruthers dishonestly
claims for the Hughes fund: it was “an
open and public, testimonial.” The differ-
ence between the two tributes is similar
both in quality and extent to that which dis-
tinguishes the Commonwealth Shipping busi-
ness, and (say) the A.M.P. —the former
doesn’t publish balance-sheets; the latter
does.
* * * •
A Mrs. Stanhope Swift, holding forth at
about the same time on the same insistent
topic, showed a clearer appreciation of the
realities of the situation; though she, too,
paid scant respect to the intelligence of her
audience.
As a genius, a master of diplomacy, a brilliant
and successful leader, Mr. W. M. Hughes stands
unequalled. Why wish to dethrone him? What
charges have they against him. The greatest crime
possible that his opponents can accuse him of is one
of having received an honorable gift of £25,000 as
a small token of appreciation from thousands of
grateful admirers to a brilliant and honorable states-
man for distinguished services rendered. Where does
the suggestion of bribery come in?
This lady, anyhow, realises that bathos and
bunkum about the possibility of Mr. Hughes
and his family having to resort to “public
charity,” and a distortion of historical facts
which are familiar to thousands still living,
will not serve. It is where she professes an
inability to see how “the suggestion of
bribery comes in” that her good faith be-
comes suspect. The thing is so obvious, and
has been examined and stated from so many
angles. On the face of it this gift is neither
(1) honorable, (2) the tribute of thousands
nor (3) for services rendered. An honor-
able gift is one about which there are no
reticences on the part of either the giver or
the taker. In that sense the Parkes gift
was honorable: it was, colloquially speak T
ing, “all clear and above-board.” If the
Hughes gift really was “a token of appre-
ciation from thousands of admirers,” then it
is clearly absolved from suspicion: in fact,
under such circumstances, suspicion would
be idiocy. But in that case, why cannot
those in the know —Mrs. Stanhope Swift,
for example—liquidate all doubts by
issuing a nominal roll of the admir-
ing thousands, as was done in con-
nection with the Parkes fund? A list of
a thousand, or even a paltry 500,
would be better than nothing. In default of
any such move on the part of Mr. Hughes
or his friends, the public is impelled to draw
certain deductions. They are that the bulk
of the £25,000 was provided by persons whom
the Government, of which Mr. llughes is
head, may help with concessions, contracts or
what not if it feels that way ; that these
persons have been so helped, since the money
was paid, and that if Mr. Hughes is again
returned to power they will be further
helped. Mr. Hughes may or may not be a
“genius,” a “successful leader” and the rest
of it, but, anyhow, such qualities have no-
thing to do with political probity. Bacon
took bribes, and Walpole enriched himself
at the public expense. In this connection
the most soaring intellect is on a level with
the debased mentality of a Tammany aider-
man. There is absolutely no difference in
principle between an eloquent and cultivated
statesman who accepts a large fortune on
the understanding that he will use his influ-
ence on behalf of a coal or shipping trust,
and an inarticulate and aspirateless subur-
ban councillor who accepts £25 to open or
close a road in the interests of the “sub-
scriber’s” ham-and-beef shop. A sufficient
reason why Mr. Hughes must either speak
out or get out; either act as Parkes did
35 years ago and let the names of his
admirers be disclosed or admit that he can-
not afford to have them disclosed and act
accordingly, is that this business, if taken
for granted, is going to act as a precedent
justificatory of boodling throughout Aus-
tralia. The tone of public life is low enough
already. The men who helped to win the
war have come home disabled to see many
of the promises made to them while they
were fighting laughed at by Hughes-
appointed officials on large salaries; and
others who went away prosperous are now
destitute in the midst of such a volume of
war-created wealth as was unimaginable
eight years ago. These men are not revolu-
tionaries by temperament; but they are
thinking, and others are thinking with them.
It will be a black day for constitutional gov-
ernment when they are satisfied, in the mass,
that their representatives are not to be
trusted; that some, at least, of the huge
fortunes made of late years have been
acquired through the influence of Cabinet
Ministers, and that one of the great parties
of Australia can see no reason why the cus-
tom should not be perpetuated. That is why
the leader of Nationalism cannot afford to
remain dumb any longer about the source
of his £25,000. It is not only his own good
name but the reputation of the moneyed
classes of the Commonwealth and the prin-
ciple of honest administration that are in-
volved.
OUR NEW SETTLERS.
Earl Haig poured boiling water on a very
brisk antheap with his statement, last week,
that some of the outlying parts of the
Empire (Queensland was the only one which
he specified by name) had given a very mixed
reception to ex-service men from Britain
who went there by invitation. The spirited
and (until he sold his distillery at a hand-
some profit) spirituous soldier blamed, not
the barrenness of the land, but the rotten
incapacity of certain Governments, in which
respect, though much of the soil is poor
enough, he was quite right. And if he knew
the ludicrous and tragic fate of our own
ex-service men, half-starved on the hen-
patches of Bankstowm, Campbelltown and
Chipping Norton (places which have the
rare advantage of being close up against the
biggest city and the biggest market of the
continent) he might have been more violent
of speech than he was. These were the men
who were started (or many of them were)
with 40 fowls (which was much the same as
going in for squatting with one sheep), 40
speeches by as many windy politicians, no
experience, a £l5OO mortgage, and a fatherly
and interfering board to do their buying and
selling, and in general justify the screws of
the board-members. The gallant and over-
proof peer stated, as a sign of the times, that
he had been bushranged by no less a person
than a Governor for £lOOO towards a fund
in aid of his famished ex-followers, and he
spoke of Australian immigration schemes in
consequence as things to be avoided.
To the Earl came, as a matter of course, a
reply from High Commissioner Cook, who
declared irrelevantly that all must be well
because 3000 folk had started for Australia
during the previous month or two, and there
hadn’t been time to learn what became of
them; also 1250 more were going, and only
a prophet could tell what their fate would
be. This rather sounded like saying that
the army couldn’t have been defeated, be-
cause more troops were being sent out. The
next lion to roar in Haig’s path was
the Overseas Settlement Committee, which
exports people to “the colonies” generally.
It alleged that the number of dis-
satisfied men who had come back or
got back to the Cold Country from
Australia in the short time the scheme had
been working was really quite small. Haig’s
possible view is that the number of dissatis-
fied men who came back from Moscow with
Napoleon I. was also limited, and that the
solitary white man of Elpiiinstone’s force
who reported himself as returned from Cabul
was no horde ; and it may be the eminent ex-
distiller’s opinion that the rest stayed behind
for lack of travelling facilities —legs and
things. In view of the demand for £lOOO he
may infer that fares are missing and that
the settlers can’t get aw'ay. In this connec-
tion these matters are certain :
Australia is one of the few (really only two) coun-
tries of the world where a number of small farmers
try to make a white man’s living and employ white
labor only, and yet grow things for a market
12,000 sea-miles away.
It is a country of little rain, which the traveller
can cross at almost its thickest part and yet not
rise 1000 ft. above sea level. Many, if not most, of
its rivers flow inland, yet their combined waters
only make a morass. And outside this basin (which
isn’t cultivated), the wheat yield is so small that
Australia’s place varies from about No. 24 to the
tail of the list among the 32 recognised wheat
countries of the globe—for yield per acre, that is.
Maoriland (in the same line of business) ranks
third, a point better than the United Kingdom. In
other words, the English or Maoriland farmer gets
over three times as much for ploughing and harrow-
ing an acre as the Australian one does. The former,
at least, hasn’t the value of his crop eaten up with
huge exporting charges, and neither can, by any
chance, have 500 miles of railway haulage to pay for
before his exportable surplus even reaches the ship’s
side. (This isn’t a natural Australian drawback, but
the insane cussedness of political man, who, in N.S.W.,
ordains that Inverell shall be 509 miles from a wharf
when Nature meant it to be 150, and Bombala 320
miles instead of about 60.)
The astonished agricultural newchum isn’t
accustomed to struggle with these strange
anomalies (the long-distance one especi-
ally) ; and is apt to be a ruined bucolic on
a stricken farm before he even realises the
situation. Then wine-and-spirit soldiers like
Haig begin to say things.
* * * *
State Socialism (so-called at least) is the
rock on which Australia, or what was good
in Australia, has come to wreck. State
Socialism and State interference made the
vast fortune of Prussia and later of Germany,
but that only proves that a rock may be used
indifferently as a strong defence or as a
weapon to drown ships with. It all depends
on the rocker. In England the Private Enter-
prise railways are much more truly owned by
the people (who are the State) than those of
Australia, though the latter are called State.
They are, at least, owned by some of the Eng-
lish people, while every penny invested in
Australian lines, and more besides, is the
money of absentee capitalists. British rail-
ways have always been large contributors
to the revenue, in railway-passenger duty
and other national taxes, and in local rates.
Australian ones, except for very rare spasms
of luck, have had to be helped out of the
taxes. London has got the use of its rail-
way capital for 2 per cent, or less, that being
all Private Enterprise has contrived to screw
out of the local lines. Sydney, according to
the latest railway report, pays £5 Is. 3d. per
cent, now, and after a few more loan renewals
it will be liable to pay more. British and
United States Private Enterprise, also the
Socialistic Enterprise of Prussia, Maoriland,
etc., always aimed at opening up ports and
finding short cuts to the sea. N.S.W,
State Prevention of Progress has opened one
port, partly opened another for coal traffic
only, and devoted all its energies to keeping
at least five more useless and vacant. If
Earl Haig, who seems to have some gift of
language, got hold of the whole details of
the anti-immigration case, his remarks might
shrivel up the next loan as a dust-storm
shrivels a violet.
A WILD, IMPULSIVE PROTEST
AGAINST TYRANNY.
The lowly member of the A.W.U., who, as
a condition of being permitted to earn his
living, is compelled to subscribe to the official
newspaper, gets a lot of instruction for his
money. True, he doesn’t learn .much about
family matters like the mysterious union
ballots, which the late Percy Brookfield
used to denounce so fervently, or the mas-
sive cost of the recent shearers’ strike, dur-
ing which thousands of fed-up sheep-barbers
are reported to have quitted the organisa-
tion ; but he is told a great deal about the
duty of rebelling against Arbitration Courts
when their awards don’t suit, and the import-
ance of seizing the means of production, dis-
tribution and exchange by “revolutionary in-
dustrial and political action.” The lowly one
is assured likewise that he ought to be a
conscientious objector when his country is
at war, and an implacable militant as re-
gards the fellow-citizen who pays his wages;
that the Commonwealth should employ
neither soldiers nor sailors, the White Aus-
tralia question being capable of arrangement
with the class-conscious (and race-conscious)
workers of China, India and Japan, and
that the glorious Red Revolution has made
Russia the happiest country on earth. Also,
that the Russians are a starving and soap-
less race, and that the foreign capitalists
who refuse to lend them 200 or 300 millions
—on no security more tangible than the p.n. of
a Government which has repudiated its war-
and pre-war debt, stolen everything it could
lay its hands on, and expended part of the
proceeds in stirring up seditious movements
in the countries to which it is holding out
the hat —are monsters of iniquity. In addi-
tion, there is a profusion of wails over the
wrongs of Erin and of malevolent attacks
on Britain, France, the U.S., manufacturers,
pastoralists, farmers and fighting men (Red
Russians and Republican Irish excepted) ;
in fact, on all opponents of the beautiful
doctrines of Tammanyism, go-slow, infi-
delity to industrial engagements, expropria-
tion, non-resistance to Asiatic immigration
and military invasion, love-your-foreign-
enemy (particularly Germany) and hate-
your-Australian-employer.
* * * *
This edifying propaganda never ceases,
and in the process of persuading the Austra-
lian workman to become a lawless and splen-
etic Bolshevik artless revelations are made
from time to time. Sydney Worker, for
example, in the column called “Just a Word
from the Editor,” published the following on
November 29
Why do the boys of Australia love Ned Kelly ?
It is the feeling that exists in the unsophisticated
heart that often injustice is arrayed in legal sanc-
tions, and that the lawbreaker may be making a
wild, impulsive protest against a tyranny that the
abject multitude accept and obey....a social system
which inevitably produces criminals, and drives into
careers of reckless lawlessness men who had latent
within them all the elements of right conduct.
1 hke the boy who thrills to the audacious exploits
of Ned Kelly and Dick Turpin and is troubled by
no conscientious respect for authority. The rebel
instinct will always keep him from degenerating
into tameness and subserviency.
He will make a good citizen.
He may, if he lives long enough. But, un-
less he resides in virtuous N. S. Wales,
which has abandoned capital punishment, he
stands a fair chance of being hanged-. That
would certainly be the fate of Herbert
Charles Curnow, of Maitland, S.A., were
he 21 instead of 18. Though old enough for
the franchise, according to the Queensland
Labor party, Herbert is too young to have
his neck stretched in the approved legal
manner. By an appropriate coincidence, this
interesting young rebel appeared in the dock
on the same day as the Worker’s transports
of enthusiasm for the hobbledehoy who
“thrills to the audacious exploits of Ned
Kelly”— a ferocious degenerate who went
bushranging because he had no stomach for
work—were given to the world. His account
of his literary studies is pertinent:—
I have always been fond of reading. When I was
a little boy at school I commenced reading stories
of bushrangers, and my reading ever since has been
confined to tales dealing with crime and adventure.
These stories I would read over and over again,
until I knew some of them almost by heart.
I used to study very carefully until I
knew the different ways adopted in carrying
out robberies with violence, and I got to fancy I
was one of these bushrangers and always wanted to
live their lives. The last year or so the wish to
become a bushranger was intensely strong in me.
I was always on the look out for a mate who would,
join me. I had planned at some time to get out:
into the scrub at Sandilands and there start on a
career of bushranging. I used to build huts in the
scrub, and thought if I could get sufficient ammuni-
tion and other necessaries I could live out there
and ward off any attempt to capture me. I always
thought that this sort of thing would be a wonder-
ful existence.
* * * *
But Herbert’s lofty ambition could never
he realised. Yorke Peninsula offers a poor
field for the talents of aspiring youths sur-
charged with rebel instinct. Had Curnow’s
lines been cast in Europe he might have im-
mortalised his memory by some resounding
crime like those of the Irish boys who shot
Collins and the German boys who made
away with Rathenau. But it was his fate
to be environed in a one-horse South Oss
hamlet and to move among unromantic and
hard-fisted cockies, whose attitude to the
bushranging industry was discouraging.
Lacking opportunities for making humanity
tremble at his name, Herbert resolved to
make sure of a local celebrity. A friendly
farmer, in whose house he was receiving food
and shelter while out of work, had a daughter,
17 years old. To her the highflown youth
made advances which she laughingly rejected.
Being troubled by no conscientious respect
for authority, and being unhampered by
either gratitude or chivalry, he decided upon
her destruction. One day when she went
out riding he laid barbed wire across the


road, so that her mount would stop, and
waited for her with a gun, purposing, after
the deed was done, to make his escape on
the horse. That plan failing, he hung about
the house next day until the menfolk had
gone, whereupon be got the gun and blew
the child’s brains out —shot her in cold
blood as she sat with two companions, bend-
ing over her sewing. For this “wild, impul-
sive protest against a tyranny that the
abject multitude accept and obey,” the hope-
ful young man was sentenced to death. A
capitalistic jury recommended him to mercy
on the ground of his youth, and a capitalistic
executive will probably commute the sen-
tence to life imprisonment in the capitalistic
dungeons that offend the soul of Thomas
Walsh (imp.). Still, the chances are that
lie will be available for service when the
Revolution arrives. With his red hands and
his unsophisticated heart, he would be a
splendid substitute for one of those Chinese
mercenaries who helped to make Russia safe
for the Bolsheviks by hacking off bourgeois
heads.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Their Repatriation Record.
Up to September 30, 1922, the Hughes Govern-
ment spent £91,150,000 ,on the soldiers. Land
settlement cost £33,150,000, war gratuities
£27,000,000, war-service homes, £15,550,000, and
general repatriation benefits £15,450,000. — Nation-
alist dope for the electors.
Tins might bo esteemed a considerable
achievement if repatriation were merely
a question of shovelling out money. But
the point that concerns the public, when
the Government is up for judgment on its
repatriation record (and the public is en-
titled to any credit incident to the amount
of the outlay, since, in the last resort, it
will have to bear the burden) is whether
the money has been wisely expended. On
this phase of the subject the Hughesites
are significantly silent. Tried by the acid
test of results, they have failed damnably.
The inquiries of a select committee have
indicated that no small part of the gratuity,
which was the Nationalist election bribe
in 1919, will be gathered in by usurers and
land-sharks. Another Parliamentary com-
mittee, on which there was a majority of
Ministerial supporters, has revealed that
several millions were squandered in various
forms of drivelling idiocy by the Depart-
ment of War Service Homes. And at least
GO per cent, of the Diggers who took up
land on the soldier-settlement principle are
in a desperate plight. What poverty of
imagination was shown in shoving hundreds
of misguided men on over-capitalised
chicken ranches like those of Bankstown
(N.S.W.) ! What blind folly was exhibited
in paying boom prices for improved pro-
perties in the settled parts of the Common-
wealth, as a result of which experienced
farmers and graziers have become non-pro-
ducers living on their investments in Gov-
ernment stock and the tyros who took their
places are in hopeless difficulties, when vast
fertile tracts in the North could have been
bought for a song. For half the £33,150,000
sunk in the delirious sort of settlement,
for which the Hughesites are responsible, the
Northern Territory, the Kimberleys and the
undeveloped portions of North Queensland
coidd have been colonised on scientific lines
by men trained and equipped for the job.
As it is, Wearne, N. S. Wales Lands Min-
ister, suggests that his lot of soldier-
settlers will have to be relieved of 20 per
cent, of their obligations, and the Lord
knows how much will need to be written off
in the other States. What the electors
think of the Hughesites and their repatria-
tion record will be shown on Saturday.
What the Hughesites think of the electors
in this connection was shown when they
nominated Millen for the Senate and Ash-
ford for the Gwydir (N.S.W.) seat in the
House of Reps., Millen having been dug
out of the debris of the unutterable War
Service Homes Department and Ashford
rescued from the ruins of his soldier-settle-
ment scheme, on which a Royal Commissioner
said the last word. In no arrangement of
words could the crowd in office have con-
veyed with such biting emphasis their con-
tempt for the people whose money they have
flung away with such mad prodigality!

Labor’s Hidden or Suppressed
Programme.
The Federal election campaign is practically
finished, and in the course thereof the aver-
age Labor candidate has mentioned practi-
cally everything alive or dead beneath the
sun except the party programme. It is a
rake event for that essential article to be
omitted, but it had to be done on this occa-
sion. The play wasn’t “Hamlet” with
Hamlet left out, but “Hamlet” with Shaks-
peare left out. What few people remember,
and what the leaders would like nobody to
remember till after polling-day, is that Labor,
according to the minutes of its own confer-
ence, stands for Communism. This pro-
gramme, about which the party candidates
are so muffled and reticent, includes the con-
fiscation to some common fund, under the
control of the party bosses, of land, houses,
businesses, ships, money and things in gen-
eral (this is “the taking over of the means
of production, distribution and exchange”),
and the abolition of capitalism (which neces-
sarily covers the repudiation of public and
private debts). Apologetic and side-stepping
members of the movement, when driven to
speak of this appalling list of propositions,
are accustomed to say that it is the work of
“extremists” and doesn’t represent the solid,
common- or horse-sense of the vast majority.
They plead that the party should be judged
by nothing that is in its avowed policy, but
by everything that isn’t there. Unfortunately,
if the “extremists” are strong enough to
make the policy in conference, it is only
reasonable to infer that they are strong
enough to carry it out if entrusted with the
army, navy, Treasury, note issue, coinage,
Commonwealth Bank, law-making power and
so on, and made drunk with the ownership of
the whole box of tricks. Success generally
makes madmen madder instead of more sane
(at least, many old Caesars developed that
way), and there is no shred of reason in
trying experiments on polling-day, merely to
find out if an avowed gorilla out of office
can be made less simian by putting him in
office. The party which wears Lenin’s
abandoned clothes can’t, if put in charge of
affairs, do the few good things that the Rus-
siall dictator did. It can’t shift an oppres-
sive royal family, for the royal family isn’t
oppressive and is beyond its reach. And it
can’t abolish a ruinous land-holding nobility
180,000 strong, for an odd baronet or so (in-
cluding one who runs picture-shows) and a few
knights aren’t exactly a ruinous nobility. The
manhood and womanhood of Australia make
their own land laws, and their biggest capi-
talists are the Commonwealth Bank, belong-
ing equally to all the people, and certain
insurance offices, belonging to any and every
thrifty person who cares to possess a bit of
them. There is not the slightest need to give
a lot of brutish and ignorant robbers un-
limited authority to tear this peaceful state
of affairs to pieces at their own wild indis-
cretion. Which is the obvious explanation
why the official Labor programme is the thing
that the canny Labor candidate speaks least
about.
The English Soldier.
“R.S.W.” PRESENTS the other aspect:—•
As a believer in inter-imperial harmony I regret
that the question of “National Fighting Qualities”
(B. 23/11/’22) was ever broached in The Bulle-
tin ; but since it has been, let me put forward some
facts and figures. Official statistics show that of
the 3,000,000 and odd casualties sustained by the
entire British Empire, the U.K. suffered nearly
2,500,000 — i.e. 80 per cent. Of the voluntary and
compulsory enlistments in the U.K. from August,
1914, to November, 1918, England contributed just
over 4,000,000; Scotland, roughly, 550,000; Wales,
roughly, 270,000 : and Ireland, roughly, 134,000. Of
the 2,500,000 casualties suffered by the U.K. let us
suppose that every single man of the Scotch, Welsh
and Irish contingents to the National Army, both
volunteer and compulsory, recruited after August 4,
1914, became a casualty. These would then amount
to just under 1,000,000 casualties. To this total,
however, must be added the casualties incurred by
the Scotch, Welsh and Irish units of the Regular
Army and its various Reserves and of the Territorial
Army and its Reserve prior to the entry of the
National Army into the war—say, at an outside
figure, 400,000. Thus, the grand total (assumed) of
the Scotch, Welsh and Irish casualties amounts to
some 1,400,000. Poor old England is therefore left
with the balance of the 2,500,000 casualties of the
United Kingdom, incurred by English troops (1)
existing prior to August, 1914, and (2) subsequently
recruited either voluntarily or compulsorily— i.e., a
minimum of some 1,100,000 casualties for both
these categories. But, of course, every man of the
Scotch, Welsh and Irish contingents did not become
a casualty, though a proportion, as was the case with
the English troops, were wounded more than once.
Allowing for these facts it becomes evident that the
purely English casualty list considerably exceeds the
1,100,000 just postulated, out of the 2,500,000
•casualties suffered by the United Kingdom as a
whole; that is to say, the allegedly degenerate
Englishman provided a casualty list of some 50
to 60 per cent, of the total.
Take next the proportion of enlistments to the
entire male population. This in the case of the
U.K. constituted a percentage of between 25 and 26
per cent. In the case of Australia (troops actually
despatched overseas) the percentage was between 13
and 14 per cent, and, including troops in training in
Australia on November 11, 1918, about 17 per cent.
Clearly, if a people unused to war on a large scale
is compelled to eventually conscript up to 26 per
cent, of its male population, its “tail” will be of
inferior mould to that of a people, also unused 10
war, which enlists only 17 per cent, of its manhood,
and those volunteers. If Mr. Huoiies' conscription
referenda had been carried, there might have been
quite a different tale to tell.
As to the aspersions cast on Gough's sth Army,
Haig, owing to French and British political pressure,
had consented to extend his front as far as Barisis,
on the Oise, some three or four months previous to
March 21, 1918. The extra front —over 30 miles
in length—was taken over by the weak- 6th Army,
which on assuming charge found the defensive works
in a hopeless state, as a result of which the winter
of 1917-18 was mostly spent in digging, etc., instead
of in training. Simultaneously Leoyd George’s
"War” Cabinet reduced the strength of the U.K.
Divisions from 12 battalions to 10 (i.e., 9 fighting
and 1 entrenching), with a battalion strength of 600
011I3'. Gough had 14 of these attenuated divisions
(11 in the line and 3 in reserve) when ho was
struck by Von Hutier with 43 divisions. In other
words, he was outnumbered by three to one. And,
finally, the mist on the morning of the day of fate
enabled the Hun, using his new tactical method of
“infiltration,” to get up under his brief but furious
artillery bombardment to within 50yds. of the
advanced posts of the English forward zone And
even with all these handicaps to face the initial
retrograde movements of the sth Army—due to
the fact that the driving in of single divisions by
overwhelming numbers exposed the inner flanks of
the divisions on the right and left—in no sense be-
came a “rout.”
To conclude, for “sticking” ability, and
for the capacity to recover when almost down
and out, the present writer, from a purely professional
point of view, would plump for the military virtues
of the English Atkins, even though he was given a
choice throughout the whole British Empire. Such
a man is usually slow, and never brilliant; but he
is tenacious, and always has the desire to come again.
One has only to look back to Mons, Le Cateau,
Ist Marne, the Aisne, Givenchy, Ist Ypres, Neuve
Chapelle, 2nd Ypres, Festubert, Loos, the bloody
series of actions of the Ist Somme (at the two
latter of which the National Army bore the greatest
share) and so on up to 3rd Ypres in 1917, in order
to realise the truly splendid virtues as a fighter of
the contemned British private soldier.
The M.L. Liquor Verdict.
There were two notable things about the
Maoriland liquor poll—the extreme dryness
of the dry districts and the remarkable wet-
ness of the wet ones. Both manifestations
contain useful lessons for N. S. Wales,
where, if the Cold Tea-ites have their way,
the issue, to beer or not to beer, will be
decided within the lifetime of the present
Assembly. The first lesson is that prohibi-
bition, once it has been established, is an
almost impossible thing to shift. M.L.’s 13
dry areas are far from being the most pros-
perous parts of the Dominion, though some
of them possess great natural advantages. In
fact, like the State of Maine, which holds the
time record for aridity in the U.S., and which
—though there is every reason why it should
forge ahead —has steadily retrogressed, they
are a mean collection of spots on the whole.
And none of them is distinguished for
sobriety. The reason they do not throw
off the influence which keeps them a lot
poorer than they might be is that too many
vested interests have grown round prohibi-
tion. In this connection U.S. Attorney-
General Daugherty pointed to some sugges-
tive facts in his annual report to the
President a few days ago
Enforcement, of prohibition had become one of the
Administration’s major problems, clogging the courts
and involving the United States in a maze of inter-
national difficulties. During the year ended June 30
there had been 34,984 criminal and 2157 civil prose-
cutions instituted in various district Federal Courts.
In addition, a vast number of violation cases had
been heard.
Think of the army of judges, magistrates,
prosecutors and policemen, and the huge
volume of law-work such a state of affairs
involves; add to it the employees of all
grades connected with the prohibition-
enforcement departments, and the hordes of
sly-grog-sellers, smugglers and illicit dis-
tillers, not to mention the soft-drink shops, rag
shops and other businesses which legitimately
acquire the money that was once spent legiti-
mately by moderate drinkers, and it will be
seen that the hold of prohibition on a country,
after a few years, must become very strong.
Prohibition has points of resemblance to the
cocaine habit: the victim is often neither
proud nor pleased as regards his addiction,
but he can’t get rid of it. If X. S. Wales
was so foolish as to risk this disastrous ex-
periment it would certainly find, in a very
short time, that its wine-growing industry,
its tourist traffic and a thousand other lucra-
tive concerns were being taken over by Vic-
toria. S. Aus. and Queensland; but that
would not mean the ability to get back to
the status quo ante. The votes of those in-
terested in prohibition enforcement, and in
the prohibition trades., would see to that, as
is happening in the 13 prohibition areas of
M.L. to-day. In 1911 the teetotal cause
did well in M.L., even in most of the wet
areas: in 1914 and 1919 it did less well, but
last week it crashed with remarkable force.
Is it not reasonable to assume that the paid
Yankee agitators—"‘Pussyfoot” Johnson,
Father Zurcher and Miss Armour —had
something to do with the catastrophe? They
all began by denying that they were being-
paid for their services, or that they were
there to influence the polling. So far as
Mr. “Pussyfoot” Johnson was concerned,, he
presently had to admit that he was being-
paid a very large salary. And, later, he
explained to a sceptical audience that,
though he had not originally intended to
stay over the elections, he would do so, on
second thoughts, since otherwise he might
be accused of “running away from a fight.”
Neither the priest nor the lady has been
bowled out quite so completely as Johnson,
but there is reason to believe that Maoriland
is as fed up with them as it is with him. It
is a remarkable piece of effrontery, however
it is considered, for such persons to come
missionising to a white man’s country which
stands at least as high in the cultural scale
as their own nigger-burning land, and last
week’s verdict suggests that the people of
M.p. appreciate the point. Presumably
the hint will not be lost on the rag, lolly and
soda-fountain interests which are expected to
finance the coming prohibition-drive in N. S.
Wales. Yankee money is bound to do its bit
towards helping to send N. S. Wales dry;
but it will be something gained, at the worst,
if Yankee voices—the awful voices of the
great Republic’s Johnsons and Zurciiers
—are kept at a distance.
Skiter Abroad.
Dear Bulletin,— England is housing a type
of Australian just now who does Australia
no credit. He is a war product of a sort,
though, of course, he had nothing to do with
the war beyond making money out of it.
Let’s call him Skiter for short. From the
moment he boards the “one-class ship”
Skiter projects himself violently into the
public eye. He is so inordinately proud of
his nationality that he bellows the word
“Australia” from one end of the vessel to the
other, all day and every day, until at last
all hands get fed up with the name. Arrived
in Southampton he begins by challenging
the Customs’ impositions. “You can’t take
me down !” he proclaims. “I’m an Austra-
lian !” Now Skiter refuses to see that the
Customs have no intention of taking him
down; neither will he admit that in reality
he is diligently attempting to take the Cus-
toms down. The idea sticks in his head
that people, other than Australians, see in
him “a Colonial mug,” and it is impossible to
shift that conviction. Nor can he be
convinced that anything, animate or in-
animate, in the United Kingdom will
stand comparison with its like in
Australia. Put him in Westminster Abbey
and he will bark “Why, that’s not a
patch on the Sydney Town Hall!” Show
him Salisbury Cathedral or Hampton Court,
and he will quote St. Mary’s in Sydney, or
Government House, Melbourne. Show him
anything, mountains, rivers, lakes, engineer-
ing feats, the glories of an Oxford College
garden, or some historic picture gallery, and
always he will turn up his nose:
“Why, in Australia”.... At Siiakspeare’s
house at Stratford-on-Avon, the other day, the
caretaker, quite innocently, discussed the ques-
tion with me. “The Americans and Austra-
lians are the worst tourists we have here,” she
said. “They see nothing except an old cot-
tage with worn old furniture. They never
seem to think of the associations.
They rush through as if they had only
two minutes to spare”.... I can see
Skiter, his raucous voice and his “Ad-
vance Australia” badge there. He is
so terribly fond of telling all and sundry the
immaterial, in fact, boring, news that lie was
born in Sydney or Melbourne, as the case
may be. Probably thousands of quiet,
decently-behaved Australians have passed
through that house of memories, and the old
lady has put them down as appreciative Eng-
lishmen ! It is only the people who know
the real Australian—the man who may or
may not be rough on the outside, but who is
all right within—that take us to their bosoms
over here, nowadays. The major portion of
Londoners, at any rate, judge us by the
bluff and bombast of our Skiters. Some find
Skiter comic: to me he is a tragedy.—
Yours, etc., Gilbert Mant.
«
Tasmania and the Navigation Act.
A wail from the South :
It was Talleyrand who thought it a novel and
even dangerous proposition that Governments should
exist for the benefit of the governed. In their deal-
ings with Tasmania the heads of the Commonwealth
Government appear to act on the same principle.
The island depends for its prosperity to a large
extent upon the tourist traffic, and overseas ship-
ments of fruit. Both of these have been dealt
deadly blows by provisions of the Navigation Act,
which have had the effect of making the British
mail steamers cut out Hobart as a port of call. In
recent years the tourist seasons have been absolutely
spoiled by strikes in the local services, the evil
effects of which, to a State which differs from the
others by virtue of its insular position, could have
been largely averted by the visits of the British
steamers, As for the fruit-growing industry, it is
on the verge of ruin. At one time the gTowers
knew exactly when the mail steamers would lift
their wares, and when the latter would be delivered
in London. These ships are experienced in carry-
ing fruit in cool storage, and they take smaller
quantities of it than the cargo boats. Under the
new arrangement the stuff arrives in England at
irregular intervals, resulting in frequent gluttings
of the market, and, in many instances, with a large
proportion in an unsaleable condition through degen-
eration on the voyage. High freights added to
these other disabilities have resulted in many grow-
ers getting absolutely nothing for their year’s work.
The local market has also failed the growers since,
owing to the price of sugar, jam has developed into
a luxury. Tasmania derives no benefit from the
Commonwealth works on the mainland, to which,
nevertheless, she has to contribute her quota. The
Commonwealth grant, to which she is legally en-
titled but which is now spoken of as an act of
charity, yields her a little over £300,000, while
she pays into the Treasury over £1,100,000.
Although the State is seething with exasperation,
so that its spirit can only be compared to that of
Honi Soit.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“All this talk about the £20,000 testimonial 10
Mr. Hughes is pure electioneering. A policeman
who looks after the people of a suburb is often
given a substantial presentation when he is moved
to another district. .. .It is idiotic to talk about a
‘bribe.’ ” — Sydney Telegraph.
When Bill, the cop at Rivershore,
Hinted he soon might be transferred
To other scenes —’twas long before
He really had official word,
Indeed I haven’t seen it yet
Announced in the Police Gazette —
The pleasant suburb where I live
Appeared unanimous for once.
’Twas up to it to Bill to give
What rough chaps style a wad of bunce.
And toffy folk prefer to call
A handsome testimonial.
For all agreed at Rivershore
His duty had been finely done.
He’d helped a lot to win the war
By being there when it was won.
And never man in the police
Had kept so tactfully the peace.
He stalked his beat and sometimes ran
In drunks—though that’s a rare event —
Law’s vigilant custodian,
Authority’s embodiment.
And every citizen would swap
A blithe “Good day!” with Bill the cop.
“Round with the Hat!” —the murmur rose,
One heard it in the summer breeze
That rustles on the line the clothes.
The crickets chirped and hummed the bees,
The street dogs barked, the placid cat
Purred in one’s ear, “Send Round the Hat!”
That ev’rywhere the project was
Approved was plain as plain could be,
Albeit Rivershore’s a cos-
Mopolitan community
Composed of almost every sort
Between the wowser and the sport.
We’ve working-men with horny hands
And sagging-bellied profiteers,
Idlers who frivol on the sands,
And Bungs who pull the foaming beers —-
Nor trade past closing time a minute
When once convinced there’s danger in it.
We’ve plutocrats who simply yearn
To spend wherever money’s spent,
And struggling souls who get astern
Inevitably with the rent.
Salubrious Rivershore, be sure,
Is but the world in miniature.
Spielers there are, and juicy mugs
Abound, on whom the spielers prey;
High-minded Christian gents, and tugs
Who scruple not to “ring a grey”
At two-up schools —with sentries out
To guarantee no John’s about.
One never doubted Rivershore
Would take the fit and proper course
To show appreciation for
This worthy member of the force.
From church parade to betting shop
Esteem w T as voiced for Bill the cop.
Lord ! how donations rattled in,
The fund ran into hundreds, quick.
And mighty cheerful was the grin
On William’s dial when in his kick
The dough he stowed aw'ay, and swore
We’d done him proud at Rivershore.
But why they gathered underground
In “tilered” rooms, with passwords hissed,
To send the tambourine around
And issued no subscription list,
I must admit I cannot tell —
You’d better ask the constable.
The Scriptures, I believe, advise
That when to bounteous deeds inclined
You shouldn’t put your left hand wise
To cheques your dexter fin has signed,
Or words to that effect. ’Twas so
They reasoned, p’r’aps. I do not know.
Perchance they thought it wasn’t nice
To let the beneficiaire see
Who set on him the highest price
Expressed in terms of f s. d.,
And who. amid that goodly host
Loving him best would miss him most.
What’s that you say? It “hums,” a gift
That anonymities subscribe?
For shame! No miscreant “douceur” sniffed,
No mean-souled carper muttered “bribe.”
We’re not so wickedly censor-
ious as that at Rivershore.

the citizens of Boston who brewed tea on a large
scale, using- their harbor as a teapot, Hughes's
Treasurer Bruch, on a recent visit, told a Tasmanian
audience that only if they were good and elected
the candidates lie was supporting- would they receive
considerate treatment. There was to be “no hector-
ing, or they would get nothing.” And when an
attempt was made to get W. M. Caesar Hughes
to be explicit in his promises, his replies (when he
deigned to reply at all) were so evasive as to make
it quite plain that his words were mere bait for
catching votes. Grave injustice is being done to
the island, and it will not be redressed until Tas-
mania is put on an overseas footing as far as the
Act applies to inter-State shipping. She must be
dependent no longer on the whim of a Minister as
regards the licensing of mail-boats to carry passen-
gers here, as the itinerary of these vessels is fixed
every year long before it is possible to produce
figures showing the necessity for them on each occa-
sion. But there is a pretty general notion that
the reform will not be wrung out of the present
Ministry, and that conviction is going to cost
Hughesism a power of votes on Saturday.
One ex-Laborite to Another.
A politician is seldom so old or so retired
that he may not be offered a testimonial
with luck, and even apart from that it is
bad form for one politician to object to
another's good fortune. Hence we have
J. C. Watson handing W. M. Hughes but-
ter on a lordly dish: —
’ I see no reason why a man who has devoted his
life to public service should not accept a monetary
testimonial as did Mr. Hughes. His work during
the war was of inestimable value to Australia and
the Empire It cannot be pretended that his
Ministerial salary, from which many inevitable de-
ductions have to be made, was an adequate reward
for the genius and devotion he displayed during our
time of trial.
The fact is that there was an immense
amount of work to be done here during the
war, in the way of finding soldiers, supplies
and money, keeping the disordered finances,
including the bloated paper issue, as straight
as possible, and looking after a very trucu-
lent gang of revolutionaries. And there
was absolutely nothing of public value
for a Premier (especially a civilian
one like Hughes) to do in England
until the Peace Conference eventuated,
wherefore the big men of South Africa and
Canada stayed at home and did things. But
Hughes hates the plodding work of admin-
istration, and does it so badly that it is
best for his reputation for him to get out of
the way when big matters must be faced, and
leave a deputy scapegoat m his place. On
the other hand, lie' can talk till the cows
come home, and then till they go away again
in horror, never to return, and he is a dipso-
maniac or drug-fiend for limelight. So he
deserted his post during a long and critical
period, and took the calcium line of least
resistance and the well-lit, spectacular way.
And though the war put no overwhelming-
strain on the time of Parliament, it was
made the excuse for throwing overboard a
lot of urgent legislation which bored the
flighty Prime Minister to extinction. That
legislation is still overboard, and the war
is still raging so badly in Mr. Hughes’s
mind that he can’t even find time to pub-
lish the balance-sheet of the Commonwealth
mercantile fleet. Anyhow, why should poli-
ticians talk of each other as if they alone
served the State and devoted themselves to
public service (at salaries fixed by them-
selves) ? If anyone wanted to pick out a
group of men who did yeoman service to all
Australia, the founders of the A.M.P. Society
wouldn’t be a bad sample. Their work
lives after them, and remains solvent.
The Lost Brolly.
“Henry Horsecollar” speaks:—
Federal Labor-leader Charlton recently declared,
in the scared voice of a prophet who has found a
keg of blasting-powder beneath the temple, that if
the Hughes Government gets another lease of office
it will abolish the baby bonus off the surface of the
planet. The news is far too good to be true. If
the Hughes Ministry secures a renewal of its engage-
ment nothing big or definite will happen, and very
little good will happen, though worse things would
happen under Charlton. Thero are big things in
plenty waiting to be done. The Dryberra capital
wants wiping out, also the excess note issue, and the
crowd of Bolsheviks who have held up industry in
the Northern Territory for three years, and a great
part of the civil service of that decaying place. It
is time for the Government to take up a lot of the
neglected powers it holds under the Constitution;
to repair the foolish blunder it made in diddling the
Territory out of the railway it paid for with about
the most lavish land-grant on record; and to assume
a definite attitude on the question of the sub-
division of the bloated States for closer settlement.
There are many other matters which are conspicu-
ously absent from the Government programme, except
that one or two make a hazy appearance in
the form of pious aspirations, and the saving of a
trifle of money against a wet day isn’t the least of
them. For the wet day is on hand to a dead cer-
tainty, and it is going to be very wet; also the
umbrella has been lost and was burst before it went
astray. Hughes ought to know. He used to repair
articles of the sort.
Within the next three years some £250,000,000
of debts have to be renewed —that is to say, the
money has to' be borrowed over again on the other
fellow’s terms. The trouble is fairly well divided
between the Commonwealth and the States. W hat
the Commonwealth has saved up so that it may
mitigate the ferocity of the loan-monger’s squeeze on
renewal day is not known, but it isn’t much. West-
ralia has over £8,000,000, thanks to the foresight of
deceased parties who embedded a sinking fund in
the Constitution. The other five States have about
£5,000,000 among them, N.S.W., with the biggest
debt, having £400,000, or about id. in the £.
N.S.W. pays far more than the average rate of
interest, its credit being the worst, and since it
began to experiment with Labor Governments in
1910 its interest rate has gone up faster than that
of any other member of the financially drunken
partnership. In 1910 N.S.W. paid £3 10s. 3d. per
cent, on a debt of £92,500,000, and some of its
loan works showed a profit. In 1921-22 it was
paying £5 Is. 3d. per cent., according to a lamen-
tation in the Railway Commissioners’ report, as the
result of borrowing harder than ever before when
money was dearer than ever before, and being
squeezed at discretion over renewals because the lack
of a sinking fund left the borrower helpless. The
position promises to become worse, and there isn’t
the slightest hope of it becoming automatically
better. The Commonwealth will almost certainly
have to assist in one place or another to save a
stoppage which might be the beginning of a land-
slide. The diversion of baby’s father’s beer money
to a sinking fund under Federal control would only
represent £700,000 a year at present, but even that
would be a blessed interference on the part of the
central authority with local insanity. And as the
baby’s birth-rate has diminished very steadily ever
THE GREEN HERRING.
The sectarian issue has been raised by Nationalism in all the doubtful N. S. Wales constituencies.
Billy: “ If this don’t put ’em off the scent call me a mug at electioneering.”
since his father got the accursed beer money the
thing ought to be abandoned anyhow as a useless
and possibly disastrous and certainly too-expensive
fad.
Unhappily, there is hardly one big and urgent
reform which can be perpetrated without undoing
something that Hughes has done, or doing some-
thing he refused to do in the past, and writing him
down an ass or a malignant influence. No new
dominion ever started with fairer prospects than
our Commonwealth, and, in the absence of invasion
or civil war, none became bogged more deeply or
muddily, or more ignominiously, or in shorter time.
It is 22 years old, and the explanation of the deep
damnation of its bogging down is that seven of these
years were all Hughes, and five more were virtually
Hughes. Nowadays he is exceedingly rich, bad-
tempered, savagely jealous of able men who might
show up his lack of capacity by contrast, too infall-
ible for words, too arrogant for description, and, hav-
ing always been an anti-Federalist or purely N.S.W.
State-Righter, as much out of place as a Presbyterian
would be in the Papal chair. He has no capacity
for public finance and wouldn’t know the article if
he met it on the steps of the Public Library—that
is to say, he is quite unacquainted with it as a
means to the solvency and progress of the country,
though he understands it as a substance that may
be waved round a candidate’s head to advantage at
an election. He has wonderful engineering ability
of the political order; wonderful continuing or
sticking ability as regards office, and wonderful
long-distance-talking ability. But there his quali-
fications cease. His programme shows him the same
old petty potterer and non-committal hunter of minor
game. Anyone who suspects this cautious ex-umbrella
healer of risking his semi-immortal portfolio by tear-
ing the baby’s father’s beer money from him is liable
to believe that James Dooley wrote “Hamlet.”
Voluntary and Other Forces.
During the not very strenuous or interest-
ing Federal election campaign the usual anti-
defence, pro-Hun and pro-Bolshevik enthusi-
asts spoke their piece, as usual, against
compulsory enrolment in the army, though
then 1 views in favor of compulsory enrolment
in trades unions are definite enough. As a
matter of fact the voluntary army, about
which so much has been said, is a piece of
non-existent bunkum. There have been
voluntary mobs, but never a voluntary army.
It is as logical to speak of a voluntary rat-
trap. A genuine volunteer force is one which
the soldier joins of his own free will, and
leaves when he pleases, so that the whole
army may resign just before the battle; and
in which he is flogged or otherwise annoyed
at his personal request, but not otherwise.
Clearly, for an army to be optional at one
end and not at the other is merely begging
the question. Britain was supposed to be
defended on the voluntary principle till a
really big war showed the absurdity of the
business; but then Britain was a naval
Power, and a navy requires few men and
vast masses of machinery. It used to man
the biggest fleet on the seas with 128,000
men, including pensioners and boys, which
number would be insufficient to make even
a third-rate army. But Britain’s voluntary
principle had a good many breaches in its
observance. It tried to run the George
Washington war without compulsory ser-
vice, and, considering how large a proportion
of the population of the Thirteen Convict
Colonies was pro-British, only record bad
management spoiled the chance of victory.
Finding volunteers scarce, the George 111.
Ministry hired compulsory Germans from
Hun princes who kept armies for hiring-
out purposes only. These incompetent, half-
hearted and heavy-footed creatures did little
save alienate friends, and surrender at times
when their fighting services were most re-
quired. During the Napoleonic wars Britain
did much of its land fighting with foreign
troops, and recruited its navy, which was
really British, by erratic violence. Its sea
forces consisted’ largely (or mostly) of
pressed men, quota men and “state-the-case
men.” Pressed men were stolen off the
streets of seaport towns or off ships at sea.
They just disappeared, and their relatives
might learn the reason in months or years
or never. At the end of the Stuart period
the famous Captain Kidd —he being then a
retired mariner of 50 —had the extraordinary
experience of being impressed to do captain’s
duty against the pirates of the Indian Ocean.
Then his impressed crew was impressed
over again for some other service, and the
gaol-sweepings whom he got instead mutinied
and turned pirates themselves. After that
their luckless captain was hanged on the
principle that “dead men tell no tales.”
Legend has it that “in good King Geokge’s
glorious days” a theatrical performance was
once damaged, if not spoiled, by the im-
pressment of the able-bodied male actors in
the second act. “Quota men” were mostly
inlanders. The High Sheriff or some such
county potentate would receive a hint that
a certain number of recruits was expected,
and that there would be no questions as to
how they were procured, so long as they
hadn’t influential friends who would make
a fuss. He sent imprisoned debtors, his own
minor creditors, elderly men whom he par-
ticularly disliked, young men whose young
wives he particularly liked, and sundries.
Generally, they were accused of something
before Bellamy Nupkins, J.P., and sent to
sea instead of to gaol. “State-the-case men”
were in a condition of suspended animation.
They, or someone on their behalf, had found
means to protest against the impressment
as being illegal for one reason or another,
wherefore a document had gone to the proper
or improper authority, and on it was writ-
ten : “State the case in the matter of John
Clodd,” etc., etc. In the Crimean War,
when the first British army of Old Con-
temptibles wore out, the getting of suitable
recruits became a very hopeless business.
France and Turkey, however, supplied bulky
forces, and a compulsory Sardinian army
threw itself into the breach just when Bri-
tain had almost decided to revert to the de-
cayed old expedient of hiring Huns. One
way and another voluntary military and
naval service, even in the land which is sup-
posed to be the special home of the pure
article, led a precarious life till it struck
its final disaster, and ceased to lead any
kind of life at all.

The State dockyard at Walsh Island is one
of the dark secrets which N. S. Wales hugs
to its bosom. As with the Commonwealth
mercantile fleet, the accounts of which Prime
Minister Hughes keeps hermetically sealed
up in a brass-bound sea-chest under his bed,
the owners — i.e., the public or common herd
—isn’t allowed to see the balance-sheet. All
that is admitted is that the dockyard doesn’t
pay interest on its cost (£870,000 of hard-
borrowed money), but how far it is short
of the interest, and whether it is short of
the whole lot, and whether it even contrives
to pay working expenses, and, if it doesn’t
contrive, to what extent it doesn’t contrive,
are matters which can’t be dug out. But
it is said that an English syndicate sees its
way to make the luckless affair pay interest
on £1,000,000, and is willing to give that
amount for it. It hopes to achieve results
by paying solely for work done and not for
the votes of the workers in addition, also by
sticking to one job instead of making the
dock the casual side-show of a big depart-
ment or universal providery. State Social-
ism of the modern type was made in Ger-
many, and Bismarck was the very successful
maker; but, then, Bismarck, who also made
the Constitution, had ways of his own. The
worker had a vote. That is to say, he had
a vote for the House which
talked incessantly, but could neither make
nor dismiss Ministers nor stop supplies. It
could refuse extra supplies, but if it threw
out this year’s budget last year’s budget
could be used over again. The Bundesrath,
whose members were nominated by princes
and sackable by their masters at a moment’s
notice, did most of any Parliamentary ruling
there was. Its debates were as secret as
the accounts of the Commonwealth fleet,
and many people didn’t know of its existence,
but it ran all that part of the show which
the All-Highest didn’t run himself. Under
this masterful policy State Socialism paid
its way like a well-managed cotton-planta-
tion in slave-nigger days. It also did very
well in Australia till Ministers began to
over-rule their expert managers and settle
the question of Bill’s clainj for “dirt money”
personally, and till the business degenerated
into a gigantic pension department. But
under the altered conditions it doesn’t pay
and never will, so the politicians are pro-
bably wise in taking the line of least resist-
ance and getting the best price possible for
places like Walsh Island out of Private En-
terprise. By the look of things the proposed
deal is merely the beginning of a land-slide
in the scrapping of Socialistic ventures.

Last week the Laborites of Sydney Town
Flail, aided by the necessary quota of “Re-

in the public interest. The Daily Mail
stated the entire position in a single head-

POLITCAL
POINTS
The majority that made Bill Massey Pre-
mier of Maoriland, and has kept him in office
for 10 years, went down the wind last week.
There is a chance of Bill’s carrying on by
arrangement with the Liberals, but another
appeal to the country is more likely. Aided
by the first-past-the-post provision, Labor
won a few seats, but it is still the weakest of
the three M.L. parties, and hasn’t the re-
motest prospect of forming a Government.
The last quarter of 1922 has been unlucky
for Win-the-war Priministers. It will be
Hughes’s turn next.
It is good news that the N.S.W. Govern-
ment has resolved to sell its wonderful fish
business, which existed to lose money, to
supply jobs for minor supporters and to pro-
mote the untidy and septic habit of selling
sea-food with the innards unremoved. When
one considered the little beetle-browed Sydney
shop which was the chief home of the busi-
ness, and remembered that it was the joint
and several, property of 2,127,271 landlords
and landladies, the situation smelled of ridi-
cule as well as of fish offal. A perambulat-
ing State umbrella-mendery might have been
worse, but not much worse.
The establishment of peace of a sort in
troubled Ireland is really expected at last.
The new Irish Government is executing
rebels with a precision and promptitude of
which the old British Government, fearful of
being called a foreign tyrant, was quite in-
capable. When the old crowd sentenced any-
body to death it was so gradual that the
martyred patriot generally made a picturesque
escape. Nowadays the wearer of the green
is shot on sight for being found on licensed
premises after hours, or anything that doesn’t
require too much elaboration. At latest
Labor members of the Dail were interjecting,
‘"Oh, for the return of the English!” suggest-
ing that a party of Irish Freedom will pres-
ently arise based on the opinions of Lord
Carson.
The Sydney press reported the following
item last month, and The Bulletin com-
mented on it (30/11/’22) :
Captain Fitzgerald, who is opposing Mr. Marks
for Wentworth (N.S.W.), said that the first over-
tures, as regards the handing over of the £25,000
presentation to Mr. Hughes, were made at the Fed-
eral conference of the R.5.5.1.L., held in Hobart in
1918. Congress was told by the president. Senator
Bolton, that he could obtain £lOO from the Fed-
eral Government and the recognition of the League
as the only body through which soldiers could
approach the Government.
Senator Bolton now writes:—
I was not aware that any such statements or
report had appeared in the press, and take the earliest
opportunity of giving an unqualified denial to all
and any of them. As I ceased to' take any active
or official part in the affairs of the Returned Sol-
diers’ League early in 1919, it must be obvious I
was not concerned in any of the matters referred to in
1920. Your publication being the champion of
honest public men and clean politics, I must ask, and
feel sure, you will give my emphatic denial the
widest publicity.
Earle Page has simplified the Federal poli-
tical situation for those who consider it com-
plex by announcing that his party is ready
to co-operate, as in Tasmania and West-
ralia, with like-minded Libs, and Nats.
Hughes will be missing from the resultant
Ministry, and so will Massy Greene. The
latter has euchred himself by his greasy
adulation of "that great and good little man,
the Priminister,” and by hysterical attacks
on the Cockies. Speaking at Maryborough
(Q.), on behalf of the sent-for Corser, he
angrily described the Agrarians as “a small
Victorian clique, who are right up against
the sugar industry,” and from whom Corser’s
electorate “will never get a fair deal as long
as they live.” That stupid variety of slander
is not'easily forgotten. By playing his cards
with judgment Greene had a chance of be-
coming P’riminister himself. As it is, he will
be hard put to it to hold his seat.
It is ineffable rot for Byrie and other
Hughes camp-followers to declare that the
little leg-puller “was offered the Prime Min-
istership of England, but refused.” Had
anyone been in the position to offer Hughes
that job he would have grabbed it with both
claws. Even Northcliffc at the top of his
power could not have pushed him into it,
minus a House of Commons record —and
Hughes never has possessed the qualities
which promise a career in the Mother of
Debating Societies. The offer to Hughes
was made to Hughes by Hughes and refused
by Hughes in the suite in his hotel, where
most of the Hughes articles and all the
Hughes biographies were inspired.
From “Galleryman’s” eyrie:—
Labor and Country party organisers allege that
Hughes will drop eight or nine seats next Satur-
day. He is exnected to suffer most heavily in
FORE!
The Australian Communist Party announces that it w A support the Federal Labor Party at the elections.
THE COMMUNIST: “ Allow me to show my practical sympathy by assisting you to get
your eggs to market with this.”
Queensland, where Capricornia and Oxley look like
returning to Labor and Wide Bay will probably declare
for Earle Page. In South Australia Barker seems
a certainty for the new Liberal crowd, and Adelaide
should be wrested from Blundell by the vociferous
Yates. Labor hopes that Laird Smith will be spared
the necessity of coming to Melbourne to represent
Denison, and as the previous Nationalist, Atkinson,
is now the agriculturists’ White Hope in Wilrnot,
Hughes ought to be two down in the Speck when
the numbers are hoisted. It is also hoped that Fre-
mantle, which Burchell won in 1913 and ’l4 as a
straight-out toiler (he afterwards turned Hughesite),
will again declare for the bowyangs. But Watson,
an Independent, is making the pace hot for both the
Lab. and the Nat. In the Ma State, the antique
Chanter, who has been Liberal, Labor and Nation-
alist in turn, is a likely casualty. The Cockies are
convinced that they will climb in over his corpse.
The Farmers are also backing their chances of tak-
ing Wannon (V.) from the affable Rodgers, and
Wise’s prospects in Gippsland look rather sick. In
fine, only a miracle can prevent Billy suffering sub-
stantial losses.. And only an eleventh-hour reaction
in his favor can bring the marvel about.
The doom of several Hughesite Senators
will be pronounced on Saturday. After the
1919 election 35 of the 36 persons in that
eminent debating society were Nationalists,
and radical changes will be necessary if the
incoming Government is to have a fair spin.
The Country party is entitled to members,
and will probably get them by the election
of such men as Abbott in N.S.W. and San-
derson in W.A. Also, Laborites like Ogden
(Tas.), McDonald (Queensland) and Mc-
Dougall (N.S.W.) will collect many odd
votes on the ground that the representation
of their party by one man and a stopgap
is good neither for the Senate nor the Com-
monwealth. Australia would lose nothing
by the disappearance of Hughes’s dreary per-
sonal followers, notably De Largie, Buza-
cott and Henderson, of Westralia. And
no one has earned rejection more than
Millen (N.S.W.), the chief architect of the
ruin known as the war-service homes.
“Bildad”: As The Bulletin lately re-
marked, great is the power of that condensed
orator named A Voice. Lately Senator Gar-
diner was blithering with pride about his
old friends Lenin and Trotsky, under whose
regime “dainty Russian princesses have now
to work hard to get a bread-ticket.” Where-
upon A Voice, who happened to be present,
asked why people needed bread-tickets under
Lenin. Seeing that Russia is at peace, and
has no debt to pay interest on, having repudi-
ated the thing, the question was appropriate.
It wasn’t answered. I don’t know if they
had A Voice in ancient times, but it has
struck me that there was one occasion when
with a word. If, when Mark Antony, the
original stage Irishman of Europe, had fin-
ished his great expounding over the dead clay
of Caesar, and stopped, breathless, perspiring,
and with his burst collar flying in the wind,
for the applause, Mr. Voice had spoken in
a tone of mixed scorn and incredulity and
said “Cripes!” I believe that assemblage
would have dissolved in laughter, and the
Caesarian legend would have died unborn.
“D.” on a time-worn trick: —
At Gore Hill Town Hall, on Monday night, a
Hughesite supporter made a special appeal to North
Sydney to vote “for Hughes and Protestantism,” and
“against Piddington and the R.C’s.” Piddington
is the son of one Anglican clergyman and the son-
in-law of another; and he is, what Hughes never
was, a regular churchgoer and communicant.
Yet the electors are asked to believe that Protest-
antism will be menanced if Piddington wins, but
is safe in the hands of Hughes. The only com-
pliment paid to the intelligence of those who wield
the franchise is that such imbecilities are invariably
rushed on them in the closing stages of campaigns,
the idea being, of course, that, given time, the most
insensitive must feel the heavy political hand hauling
at their legs.
“Gallery”: Though Jim Scullin has a per-
fectly safe seat in Yarra (Vic.), he has been
scurrying over the electorate as if he were
lighting a forlorn hope. He reckons that
nothing must be left to chance. Scullin is
an excellent talker, with all the good jour-
nalist’s dislike for the unnecessary word. He
learnt to produce his neat and dapper Eng-
lish on Ballarat Echo, Victoria’s only Labor
daily, of which he was managing editor for
nine years. He is a treasured judge in the
oratory and debating departments of Bal-
larat’s South-street competitions.
At Melbourne last week the shareholders
in Bawra voted down a cool proposal that the
undistributed assets of the organisation,
amounting to £6,000,000, should be employed
to finance “a central organisation for the pro-
tection, stabilisation and development of the
pastoral and agricultural industries.” The
idea was that of Higgins, controller of metals
and wool under the Hughes dynasty, and
would, if realised, have established a per-
manent dictatorship in wool, if not in wheat
and other products. But the woolgrowers
flattened it out in one act. Australia is tired
of dictatorships, industrial and political both.
An enemy (and everybody is liable to
have an enemy or two) once said that
N.S.W. Attorney-General Bavin was no
worse than he ought to be, and that he
would be more human if lie had a huge meal
of underdone meat and six whiskies in quick
succession, and then became the co-respon-
dent in a divorce suit. Still, his State
will owe him a debt of gratitude if he shifts
off the Sydney streets, as he threatens to do,
the hundreds.of females who -have been sell-
ing tickets at every corner for the Hebrew
Bricklayers’ Carnival and Art Union, and
such-like events. Worse still are the able-
bodied men who hang for months round a
tired-looking motor-ear, which is to be
raffled as soon as 200,000 one-bob tickets
have been disposed of. It is alleged that out
of a £25,000 event the prizes are lucky if
they amount to £lO,OOO, expenses get away
with £14,900, and poor old Charitv has to
be very quick off the mark to cop the re-
maining £lOO.
Speculations of an old campaigner:—
A Hughesite organ alleges that the Ministerial-
ists will come back 43 strong in a House of 75.
Which is utter nonsense. A better-informed pre-
diction is that the Government will lose seats in
every State but Westralia, where Labor stocks are
low. And Westralia is anything but safe for
Hughes. The Ministry’s fate will be decided in
N. S. Wales, and it is hoping- for a repetition of
the vote which hurled the Dooleys out last March.
But many things have happened since March. The
44-hour week has been abolished, the civil servants
have been withdrawn from the State Arbitration
Court, there is increasing discontent among the
Diggers, and sectarian fever has noticeably mod-
erated. All this will tell against the Government
in city arid suburban electorates, particularly as
it has been in office for five years, and in the coun-
try districts the Cockies are steadily growing stron-
ger. In the new suburban constituency, Reid, the
Labor man is having the better of the going.
Hughes himself, with the big Chatswood vote to
help him, looks comfortable in North Sydney, but
Lamond is no certainty for Barton, and Riverina
and Chanter are about to take a long farewell. The
Nationalists have a good candidate in Neville Howse,
V.C., and he may whip the lethargic Lavelle in
Calare. Nicholls (Macquarie) is another Laborite
who is in danger; the redistribution hasn’t been
kind to him, and he seems to have lost interest in
his job. Speaking generally, one expects both the
Labor and Country parties to poll more strongly
than nine months ago. As for Catts’s Labor group,
it will be satisfied if it holds Cook (the A.L.P.
swears that it has Catts’s scalp), but it talks enthusi-
astically of unseating Mahony in Dailey. The job
would have been much easier on March 25.

Now is the season when a flood
Is loosed upon us by the Fates,
A turgid stream composed of mud
And remnants of defunct debates;
The sluice-gates open, and out pour
Dull catchword and dead metaphor.
Swamped are the words of daily use —
The nouns and verbs of living speech—
For polysyllables abstruse
And clots of mire come through the breach ;
It is a hybrid language, alien
To all who deal in plain Australian.
We read that lawyer Flym demands
That primary producers all
Should, take their pikes up in their hands
And place their backs against the wall,
And in this pose defend the nation
Against the wolves of Confiscation.
While Flam, the plumber, hints that deep
Financial plots, inspired by knavery,
Are being engineered to keep
The mass in economic slavery,
But that his party’s brawn and brains
Will burst the proletariat’s chains.
This jargon in an uncouth tongue—
This tired and garbled rhetoric —•
Gibes that were old when Job was young
And shop-soiled phrases—makes me sick.
Are public men too proud to utter
Such simple words as bread and butter?

NO BAITS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Practically all the Country party candidates are
Australian-born, and those of military age are either
returned soldiers or rejected volunteers. In his
policy speech Earle Page said, “I have no baits.”
Prom Billy, with his coarse, envenomed gibes,
His party’s putrid past, its gaudy bribes;
Prom Labor, with its communistic cant,
its desolating made-in-Russia rant,
One turns with hope to those who neither hates
Nor fears exploit for votes, nor dangle baits.
Not theirs the scandal of the soldier’s shack;
With muddy deals their record isn’t black;
Not theirs the foul corruption of a creed
Fit only for a mongrel quitter-breed;
They speak as men to men, as mates to mates,
Who are Australians all, and have no baits.

1921 period, and after paying the usual 124
p.c. £35,272 was available for reserves. While
premium income in other offices has sagged
considerably owing to declining values and
restricted* trading, the Queensland Insurance
net premium income was only
£14,000 below its record year. The manage-
ment has been steadily developing its in-
terests, and to cope with increased business
m Europe much larger premises have been
acquired in London, and in Calcutta the co.
has established a branch instead of depend-
ing upon agencies. Losses last year were
heavier in relation to premiums than in any
years since 1915, but the claims rate was less
than the pre-war average. Here are details
of underwriting which compare the loss and
cost rates, and, incidentally, show how
rapidly the co.’s business has grown:—

Last year the underwriting profit amounted
to £50,950, and £40,810 net was earned bv
investments.
The ; addition _to reserves of £35,000-odd,
taken into consideration with the small de-
cline of premium income, has added to the
strength of this Australian office as an under-
writer. Paid capital is half-a-million, and
there is £125,000 in general reserves, £175.000
in a reserve for unexpired risks (equal to
slightly more than 40 p.c. of the year’s pre-
mium income), and a P. and L. balance of
£Bll4. Funds total £808,114. and represent
188 p.c. of net premiums received during the
12 months. That is 14 points better than a
year ago, and 38 points more than the pro-
portion which is generally considered a fair
protection for policy-holders. With its pre-
sent funds the co. could pay claims four
times those of last year. These funds are in-
vested m first-class securities. The balance-
sheet total at September 30 was £1,085191
and no less than £816,604 of that was repre-
sented by public securities and cash. This
comparison shows how the holdings of Gov-
ernment paper have grown since the pre-war
balance:—

Eight years ago more than one-fourth of total
assets was in properties, but additions to
funds have been so large that premises now
represent only one-tenth of the balance-sheet
total. The Queensland has been one of the
most successful local fire and marine offices.
It has done so well that shareholders’ capital
in 11 years has been increased from £75,000
to £500,000 wholly from profits. To old
hands the 124 p.c. div. is consequently giving
n very handsome return.

The accounts show operations in a different
way: premiums and interest contributed
£83,992, claims were those given by the table,
but the cost of handling new and old busi-
ness was set down at £50,013. That gave a
surplus in the revenue account amounting
to £32,418. Had that represented the final
result of the second year’s activities it would
have been a very Creditable performance, but
£19,911 more was spent on “establishment
and organisation of branches,” and a further
£8457 on establishing an Industrial depart-
ment. So, after crediting £398 profit from
sale of property, all that was left of total
income of £84,390 was a trifling £4448.
Nevertheless, under the heading of "Profits,”
the directors indulge in a little leg-pulling
in their report:—
Profits. —In spite of the heavy expenditure insepar-
able from the establishment of branches and extension
of business activities to three other States, and the
inauguration of the industrial department at head
office, a substantial surplus has been made on the
year’s operations. This surplus enables an assurance
fund to be created, the importance of which it would
be difficult to exaggerate, it will be a most import-
ant part of the eo.’s policy to increase this fund each
year.
Of the year’s surplus £1394 was taken to re-
duce the establishment account to a round
£20,000, and the balance of £3054 was
placed to the credit of an assurance fund.
The talk of “profits” and a "substantial sur-
plus” at the present stage is a joke which
would be very apparent if, along with the
report, the directors had included an esti-
mate by actuary Wolfenden of the liabilities
which existed under policies at the balanc-
ing date. Only the actuary can ascertain
the approximate amount required for the
steadily increasing liability to policy-holders
who have placed three millions of assurance
with the co. in its two years. The accumu-
lation of funds to meet obligations contracted
for in G4GB policies accepted is as much a
necessity as the setting aside of cash to
pay next week’s salaries and other accounts,
though, under normal conditions, years
elapse before a life office is called upon to
pay over the savings of policy-holders. So
far the Producers and Citizens’ has received
£117,488 and been called upon to return
only £l5Ol to policy-holders. Meantime, cur-
rent expenses and the cost of establishing
and extending the business have together
absorbed £132,873, outgoings having exceeded
income by £16,946. So not a penny of in-
come has been available tor establishing a
fund to meet claims under policies. In the
prospectus issued on May 1, 1920, the pro-
moters stated that “within six months of
flotation this co. should be working on a
profitable basis” !
The optimism of the promoters was based
on agreements which had been made with
the Farmers and Graziers’ Co-op. Co.
(N.S.W.) to employ its staff for field opera-
tions. Similar agreements were afterwards
made with co-op. producers’ cos. in other
States. In this way it was hoped to harvest
a big business at low cost, and also save
“many thousands of pounds” in establishing
the concern. A large poiicy business has
certainly been won in quick time in this
way, but the promoters have been disillu-
sioned as to costs, both of business-getting
and of establishment of the enterprise. The
two balance-sheets show that to July 31 last
£46,550 half the paid capital—had
been spent on “establishment, organisation
and extension.” Excluding last year’s estab-
lishment charges, the accounts claim that
£83,992 of income was won at a cost of
£50,013, an expense rate of 59.5 p.e. But
for every £1 of premiums from old business
nearly £2 was collected from new policies,
and new business is necessarily costly. On
the basis that old business cost only 7 p.c.
of renewal premiums, then the accounts
claim that last year’s £54,444 of first pre-
miums cost £48,087, or, approximately, 88
p.c. That is a lower cost than in many of
the big offices, and if the management ’ can
continue to win new policies at around that
figure it will do very well. But the position
as to the cost rate cannot be satisfactorily
determined until the outlay on establish-
ment and extensions ceases.
For the present, though total outgoings
have exceeded income, the Producers and
Citizens’ policy-holder is amply protected by
shareholders’ funds. Proprietors have put in
£83,000 of cash. At July 31 liabilities,
apart from those accruing under policies,
amounted to £10,021, and there were the
following assets: Government securities
£30,042; deposits and cash, £10,287; mort-
gages, £8819; book debts, agency balances,
etc., £22,522 ; and furniture and stationery,
£5970. Assuming book debts and agency
balances were all they should be, there were
net tangible assets for approximately £61,000.
Of the paid capital of £97,962, £14,000 is
represented by goodwill and £16,946 net by
establishment account. In addition, at pre-
sent capital is carrying the full weight of
the policy liabilities. Before shareholders
can hope for any div., assurance activities
must produce surpluses ample to provide
funds to cover both current actuarial re-
quirements and arrears, and when the
balance between income and outgoings has
been satisfactorily adjusted, shareholders
cannot expect more than one-fifth of the pro-
fits, the other four-fifths being made avail-
able for bonuses for policy-holders. Even
if no attempt is made to replace any of the
£34,000 of capital now represented by good-
will items, years must pass before proprietors
can get a div. Everything depends on how
cheaply the management can handle old and
new business, and on retaining the business
it writes. Last year, the directors state, 81.2
p.c. of the first year’s business was renewed.
Meantime, efforts have been made to reduce
costs, the indoor staff having been “completely
re-organised.”
One item in the accounts calls for com-
mept. Twelve months ago freehold property
figured among the assets with a book value
of £2002. During the past year it was sold
at a profit of £398. This freehold property
consisted of vacant suburban lands, and is a
class of asset with which a life office should
not be associated, except as a mortgagee pro-
tected bv a substantial margin.

Since the war boom collapsed many local
and overseas jam and canning cos. have gone
to the wall, and others have disclosed heavy
losses, or, at best, only slender profits. De-
spite the severe buffeting the industry has
experienced, Henry Jones’s big co. has con-
tinued to disclose handsome earnings, and
124 p.c. divs. have been paid regularly for
five years. The concern was evidently care-
fully nursed during the boom-period, and
probably did better during the war than
the disclosed figures suggested. The direc-
tors admitted that a “considerable portion”
of the 1921 profits had been derived from
reserves accumulated by subsidiary cos.
Henry Jones Co-op. is itself not a jam
manufacturer; it is merely a holding con-
cern which controls numerous manufactur-
ing cos. throughout the Commonwealth, and
in England, California and 8. Africa. In
the published balance-sheet these interests
are all in one heap with a book value of
£1,109,756. the only other asset being
£65,500 of War Loan. The other side of
the balance-sheet discloses that the parent
owes £205,798 to subsidiary cos. The in-
vestor can, therefore, learn very little from
the published accounts. But comparisons
over a period of years show that, besides
feeding the parent with good average profits
with which it has paid handsome divs. to
shareholders, the subsidiaries have also pro-
vided it with large funds for investment. Only
three years ago the parent’s balance-sheet
showed £37,068 as having been advanced to
subsidiaries; now the parent owes its family
£205,798. Still, nothing definite is disclosed
by these comparisons; some of the cash
handed over may not actually have been
surplus funds held by the subsidiaries. For
instance, to aid the investment policy of the
parent, members of the family may have
secured funds by mortgaging their belong-
ings. Paid capital is £732,756, and in the
13 years since its establishment the co. has
shown net profits totalling £982,714, £808,534
of which has been distributed to shareholders.

Paid capital is £B5OO in 1000 £1 fully-paids
and 15,000 paid to 10s. But in 37 years the
co. has accumulated visible reserves exceed-
ing double that capital, and consequently the
25 p.c. div. which the co. has paid regularly
for many years does not represent anything
like the extent of its true earning capacity.
Last year’s net profit of £2874 gave a return
of slightly more than 10 p.c. on total funds.
At Sept. 30 those .funds totalled £29,234.
but the co. was <also working on £48,156 of
outside money. Advances to. clients and
other book debts amounted to £49,200. The
book value of property, saleyards and plant
was £13,955, stocks of merchandise and
manures were valued at £10,236, and £4OOO
of War Loan was held. The co.’s position
depends almost wholly on the soundness of
its advances. They have always been large
in relation to funds. The steadiness of pro-
fits over many years suggests that the busi-
ness is very comfortable. Recent earnings
have, of course, not been so good as during
the period of abnormal prices. Besides,
activities in the Speck nor’-west, where a
ready-made business was acquired half-a-
dozen years ago, have proved disappointing,
chiefly owing to operations there having been
more costly than* had been anticipated.

Until 1018 this co. had been engaged shift-
ing the dead-horses it had stabled since the
’nineties. Lately it has been steadily
developing new building-society business, and
balance-sheet figures for four years have
moved in this way:—

Prior to the 1919 balance the directors an-
nounced that a revaluation of assets had
disclosed that they were worth £24,000 more
than their book value of approximately
£lB,OOO, and that amount was added to re-
serves. The management shortly afterwards
decided to dabble in subdivisioning, and for
two years handsome profits from land sales
aided divs. Last year, though values were
maintained, the volume of sales was small.
Earnings for the past three years have been
made up in this way:—
Interest, Profit from
Income. Rents, etc. Sales.

Expenses absorbed £5287 of last year’s gross
earnings, leaving only £989 profit. But the
period benefited by £9850 gross surplus from
the City Council resumption of the co.’s pre-
mises, though that was reduced to £6823 when
commissions, removal costs and legal charges
had been debited. The directors see pros-
pects of much additional mortgage business
and are inviting further deposits. Deposi-
tors are well protected; at Sept. 30 there
were assets with a book value of £112,665 to
back £20,290 loaned to the society.

Manager Phillips was able to reduce f.o.b.
costs (exclusive of depreciation) to 61d.,
giving a profit margin of a penny. But
after meeting administration costs and pro-
viding £122 for depreciation, a loss of £716
—almost Id. per lb. —showed up. For_the
current year it is hoped to cut costs to 54d.
for an output of 215,0001 b. So if the mar-
ket does not fall to pieces altogether, the co.
should continue to keep its head above water.

There is talk of introducing an amend-
ment to the Queensland Mining Act in the
next session, providing for the registration of
oil geologists, or persons qualified to report
on oil prospects. If it comes into force it
will put an end to the quack who can bring
out a glowing prospectus and pluck the un-
fortunate public at his will. There are
several ventures at present in the northern
State which experts consider are in impos-
sible areas, and haven’t the ghost of a chaficfe.
A proposed oil float, which would have to
bear a report by a registered man, should do
away with a lot of unnecessary wild-catting.
It would likewise make a hash of that curious
phenomenon, the oil-diviner.

The geological party at Freney’s returned
to Perth the other day, and its leader,
Blatchford, states that favorable structures
have been located on both the Mt. Wynne
and Price’s Creek areas, and stresses the
importance of the occurrence of bitumen at
274 ft. But he sounds the warning that while
the presence of bitumen showed that oil un-
doubtedly did occur at one time in the local-
ity, it still remained to be proved whether
the supply from which it was derived exists
now, and if so whether it is m payable quan-
tities. This problem can only be solved by
boring.
Okes-Durack Kimberley Oil Co.’s accounts
to Nov. 18 show that it had fixed deposits and
cash totalling £86,715. Liabilities amounted
to £9231, including £B5OO due to M. I*.
Duraek. In addition there were two con-
tingent liabilities, one to M. P. Duraek of
£25,000 in £1 shares when a similar number
of the 130,000 unissued shares have been
taken up by the public, and another of
£1583 contracted under salary agreements.
Bad roads are hampering the transport of
plant from Wyndham to the co.’s property,
but all the machinery and equipment should
soon be on the ground. The first trial bore
is to be put down three miles from the
Northern Territory border. About 50 square
miles lying immediately opposite this bore
site have also been secured by the co.

Tasmanian Petroleum Co., N.L., is form-
ing to amalgamate the Kingston Oilwells Co.
and the Melbourne Oil Exploration Syndi-
cate. The former holds licenses over oil and
oil-shale in S. Aus. and Tas., and the syn-
dicate has areas at Latrobe and Barn Bluff
(Tas.) and at Anglesea (Vic.). The co.
proposes to drill for liquid supplies along-
side the Mersey Valley Co.’s ground, and at
the same time tackle the oil-shale deposits
with a unit of two retorts.

The Lander Oil Corporation, which has
acquired the six 2000-acre blocks taken up
by D. M. Milsom at Orallo (Q.), has got
to work. The regulations under which it
is bound by the Government provide for a
geological survey of the area to be completed
within one year. The areas are to be divided
into zones, and within the second year
boring must be begun in at least two zones,
the number of bores to be increased during
the three succeeding years. After a bore
has reached a certain depth the Corp. may
abandon operations only by forfeiting the
right to renew drilling on that particular
zone. The Government obtains royalty on
a sliding scale: if production is ' under 50
tons monthly the loyalty is 10 p.c., increas-
ing to 15 p.c. for 100 tons. The tenure of
lease is 25 years, and can be extended an
additional 15 years, though the Government
then comes in on a 50-50 basis on all oil pro-
duced.

An interesting side-light has just been
thrown upon the recent agitation on the
part of the Zinc Producers’ Association in
favor of an export duty on ore and concen-
trates, and it fully supports The Bul-
letin’s contention that the proposal must
have been prompted by a motive that was
not altogether philanthropic. It now tran-
spires that the Imperial Government bought
large stocks of concentrates on the basis of
spelter at from £2B to £3O per ton, against
the present quotation of £3B, and it is
naively stated that “those who have special
reason to congratulate themselves are share-
holders of the Electrolytic Zinc Company,
because their directors succeeded in inducing
the Board _of Trade officials to sell to the
company 750,000 tons of zinc concentrates,
at a time when the open market for spot
spelter stood at £23 55., a figure far below
the present range of prices.” The deals
work out thus: Sold to Imperial Govern-
ment, 750,000 tons on the basis of £29 per
ton: “induced” the Board of Trade officials
to return this to the original sellers at £23
per ton; now available for sale to English or
other buyers at not less than £3B per ton.
In other words, they get a discount of £6
per ton from the Imperial Government, and
can now sell, if they wish, at a premium of
£l5 per ton. Capital business —for the co.!
The genius who can evolve such satisfactory
financial manipulation as this is surely
worthy of public recognition. What about
that baronetcy, for example?
* * *■ #
A London financial authority predicts a
big demand for all zinc products at materi-
ally advanced values in the near future. lie
states that the spelter market has shown a
strong undertone of late, and prices had
reached a record for the year. This price
movement is said to be based on intelligent
anticipation of an adjustment in values
which had become inevitable >wing to the
remarkable change in the statistical position
of the metal and the prospects of an increase
in the demand : “It is fully recognised that,
given anything like a competent Govern-
ment, pledged to economy, and something like
a settlement in Europe, there should be a
big launching out in all commercial enter-
prises ; hence spelter may be needed in large
cp anti ties during the next year or so.” In
September, 1921, the world’s unsold surplus
of zinc was 150,000 tons ; now “probably it
does not amount to much more than 50,000
tons.”
* * * *
Some comparative statements reveal in a
marked manner the gradual decadence of the
gold-mining industry in N. S. Wales, until
now it is almost at the point of total ex-
tinction. To the end of 1899 the total value
of all minerals was £134,064,000, with gold
at £47,546,000, or about 35.5 p.c. of the
whole. To the end of 1921 all minerals
stood at £335,839,000, with gold at
£63,073,000, or about 19 p.c. In 1921, all
minerals, £14,000,000; gold, £217,000, or
only 1.55 p.c. For the first 10 months of
this year gold production was only
22,1590 z. as against 45,7730 z. for the same
period last year. The highest yield of gold
for any year was £2,660,946 in 1852, with a
steady decline to £674,477 in 1857, and a
sudden recovery to £2,467,780 in 1862. The
1880 decade was particularly low, ranging
from £317,241 to £573,582. From 1894 to
1907 there were only two years in which
values were below £1,000,000. Since then
there has been a. continuous decline. The
disappearance of Great Cobar and Mount
Eoppy mines from the list of producers
has_ been the most serious factor in the
falling-off of recent years. During the 20
years of its existence Mount Boppy treated
1,076,050 tons of ore for 429,6500 z. gold
worth £1,824,982.

Great Britain Tin, Emmaville (N.S.W.),
had the good luck last half-year to strike the
richest ground, in bulk, that it has ever
worked, and the profit reduced the £1464
debit at I‘. and L. to £948. The return from
the Back lead for the term was approxi-
mately 40 tons from 26,182 c. yd., an average
of 3.411 b. per yd. The depth is about 9ft., and
average value 3.41 b., against 2ibk from the
Mam lead. This is an unexpected development;
and as there is a large area to be, treated, if
values keep anything like’ near the present
mark, the co. should have a renewal of its
old-time prosperity. The Back lead was
somewhat despised ; it was knowh ' that it
was intensely hard, and it was assumed that
values were low. Recent work has disclosed
that it contains more solid ground than was
left in the Main lead; this is attributable,
doubtless, to the extreme toughness of the
layer of cement, from 3ft. to 4ft. thick,
which runs through it, and which was almost
impenetrable by the pick-man of early times. ‘
This cement has to be blasted, and the
blocks removed by hand.

Hampton Properties London Board an-
nounces that as developments on Block 45
are proving “so satisfactory,” it intends to
increase the capacity of the crushing plant
now approaching completion. Some people
who know the field much better than the
directors consider that the co. should delay
its leap in treatment equipment. The direc-
tors’ circular also talks of Hampton Celebra-
tion having been greatly hampered by scar-
city of water; but shortage of payable stone
would have been nearer the mark.

As everything else is down and out, or
showing signs of exhaustioh, Coolgardie
(W.A.) is pinning its faith to the recent find
in the hitherto erratic Lloyd George mine.
Since March last about £lO,OOO has been ex-
tracted from the south end of the 100 ft.
level, where the present face is 20ft. wide.
The extension of the shoot has been picked
up over 200 ft. away in the next lease.

Mining cos. here have slowed down in the hope
that some relief in the way of cheaper supplies
and revision of awards will come along in the

Horseshoe.—A fall of ground at 2200 ft. recently
exposed a lode of good value, which has since been
proved, by boring, up to 1500 ft. level. Some very
high assays were obtained on the way. ‘ *

developments have occurred in this mine lately, but
pending the installation of a new treatment plant
and resumption of crushing, very little is being

Ivanhoe. —A crosscut is being extended from 3000 ft.
to cut the lode near the winze sunk from 2750 ft.
in payable values. The lode at 2750 ft. is entirely
free from the porphyry dyke which for years has
proved so disastrous to Ivanhoe in deep ground.
It will, however, take the 3000 ft. crosscut some
time to reach its objective.
South Italgurli looks extremely well at depth
and its admirers talk optimistically of regular divs’
° r ° ya Li , nks is said t 0 ha ve a good shoot over
300 ft. in length at the No. 9 level of the old
Croesus Proprietary workings, and now that it has
bought the Kalgurli mill, which is in good order
and suitable for treating all classes of ore, the co.
is expected to get a move on.

Bendigo ° n “ important discoveries” at
Bendigo’s big reputation has been founded largely
on its extensive system of saddle reefs. Its future
will rest on massive formations of spurs which run
parallel with the anticlinal reefs. Probably the most
successful work on spurs has been done in the Moon
mines, at Eaglehawk, closely followed by the Carlisle
on the Garden Gully line. In these and other in-
stances the gold has been won from spurs occurring
in the limbs of the anticlines that have an eastern
inclination, and it became almost an accepted con-
clusion that it would be useless to prospect on the
other side. However, the signal success of New Blue
on a western formation of spurs upset this conclusion,
and induced some enterprising speculators to try
western sections on other areas. Reports of import-
ant discoveries have just been made public. It has
been known that for over a year past a syndicate
with which Herbert Phillips, late of the B.A.G. admin-
istrative staff, and “Bob” O’Brien, manager of New
Blue, are associated, has been prospecting leases at
Spring Gully, south of Diamond Hill, formerly held
by English cos. These leases are on the Nell Gwynne
line, an anticline west of the main New Chum line
and quite as persistent in its course throughout the
field as the New Chum, which used to be regarded
as the “mother lode” of the district. The English
cos.—North Bendigo (what a misnomer for a mine
on the extreme southern end of the field !) Victoria
Proprietary and Nell Gwynne—restricted their opera-
tions to “centre country” on the anticlinal reefs.
The new men set to work in the Nell shaft to test
the western ground parallel with the anticline, and
also the synclinal fold off the adjoining British and
Foreign line. In a crosscut from the 257 ft. level
they have passed through a body of spurs 80ft. wide
which extends to the surface. It is reported that
“taking everything the mill value over 80ft. of
crosscutting and from 100 ft. of rising is Oldwt. per
load. Operated on a mining scale, taking 50ft. for
crushing and ‘mullocking’ with the balance an aver-
age of lOdwt. can be expected. A special feature is
the even distribution of the gold; every spur passed
through Shows gold. This formation must go down
to the major fault in the Nell ground, or about
400 ft. The pitch is regular to the southward, and
as denudation has been extensive it is assumed that
the depth of the formation in Bendigo North will be
not less than 500 ft. and 1000 ft. in the Victoria. The
formation is intact throughout the whole area—thou-
sands of feet —except at the south end, where in the
earliest days phenomenal yields were won from the
,Sarnia and Donnybrook ‘backs’ to a depth of 120 ft.
The heavy expense of shaft-sinking has all been in-
curred ; the deposits are attackable from the Nell
and British lines by crosscuts from 100 ft. to 200 ft.
in length. The Nell Gwynne is ready for a crushing
plant, and the others will not take long.” A co. of
42,000 shares, of which Sydney has taken a large
block, has been formed to work the Nell Gwynne.
* * * *
Two leases on the Christmas reef, Kan-
garoo Flat (Bendigo), have been taken on
six months’ working options by the White
Hope Gift and Hunter’s Pernatty cos. The
consideration is to be solely in paid-up
shares. The leases were formerly known as
the N6rth Christmas and Opossum. The
line is one on which very little work has
been done; but some of the surface workings
w r ere fairly productive in the early days.

Scottish Gympie (Q.) is a hive of indus-
try on the Inglewood reef, where 1,500,000
tons of low-grade ore are considered a rea-
sonable certainty. There is a very small
margin to work on, and the State Govern-
ment has assjsted slightly lately by a freight
rebate of 6d. a ton on Burrum coal to the
field. No. 4 North Phoenix is looked to for
the thrills, but things are fairly quiet,
although the manager keeps a few slugs up
his sleeve to liven up the battery returns. So
the christening of the co.’s own mill should
witness something sweet. The State is
assisting the Louisa vfith a £2OO subsidy,
and that show is reported to have unearthed
a fair body of ore recently. The Lucknow
is battling along on a very small reef in
tight conglomerate country at a depth of
140 ft.
* * * *
The most recent party to take up the Vul-
can, Irvinebank (Q.), have done six weeks’
hard work to date, and a crushing of 50
tons has been got together somehow. Most
of this has come from the 560 ft. level, where
the stopes are carrying small patches of rich
ore, but so small that a lot of mullock goes
up with it to the surface and the battery re-
turn will be nothing out of the way. Scratch-
ing is proceeding at the 600 ft. and 750 ft.
levels, but only in ground that was covered
by the previous tributors, and what tribu-
tors leave is notoriously small. Operations
are handicapped by having to clean out
levels again and keep the water down. Pros-
pects don’t look rosy.
* * * *
Dry weather is delaying operations at Mt.
Coolon (Q.), but the mine promises to
exceed the output of Barclay’s Native Bear
next year. The co. has a lode about 800 ft.
long, with the No. 1 shaft at one end and
the open-cut at the other. In the former the
lode is not less than 7ft. wide, and is up to
12ft. in places. In the open-cut it averages
about sft. Shallow intermediate workings
show that it carries right through at possibly
an average of at least 6ft. or 7ft., so there
is a big body to be taken out down to 150 ft.
How big it is can only be guessed until
the workings go down deeper. The co.
erected a 10-head battery earlier in the year,
and has since put through over 500 tons
averaging almost an ounce. If values con-
tinue to any depth, the show is likely to
have impressive reserves. At present it
would be unwise to think further than a
depth of 150 ft. in terms of recent crushings.

Prior to the Soviet bursting up industry
generally, a powerful British-American cor-
poration, known as the Russo-Asiatic Co.,
headquarters in London, controlled vast
mineral fields in Russia and Siberia. Dur-
ing the disturbances the assets and properties
were seized, and the co. has been battling
very hard to get them back ever since. News
came through recently that chairman Leslie
Urquhart, working in conjunction with
Krupp’s and a large German bank, had met
Krassin, Soviet Minister of Trade and Com-
meree in Berlin, and signed an agreement for
a 99-years’ lease of its properties. Later
information suggests that the Soviet has
refused to ratify the agreement. The mines
which this co. controlled produced 20 p.c. of
Russia s gold output, 70 p.c. of the copper
and practically all the lead and zinc. The
old employees have been endeavoring to induce
the Soviet to permit the corporation to re-
open the mines and smelters —“nationalisa-
tion is apparently no use to them.

“Caringa”: A few nights ago a Mosman

who had been mobilised to deal with an
impending- domestic event, to ring np the
doctor and say: “Come to Emoh, 1123 Uxor

obliged, as any true woman would in the cir-

“Walks after it, an’ ’its it again.”
“Well, what’s ’e want to ’it is so far fur?”
“Clifford Snook” deals with a disreputable
and crooked letter: —•
The letter “S” is the initial of “serpent” and
“snake.” It is shaped like them, and it hisses simi-
larly. It is a disreputable curve, and there is little
good in it.
It is remarkable to what extent the words which
express mean, base and untidy things begin with
the snake initial. To quote a few there are salacious,
Sambo, satyr, sausage, savage,, saveloy, soft, sawder,
scab, scabies, scalawag, scandal, scaramouch, scoff,
scold, scurvy, scoundrel, scowl, scrabble, scraggy,

swank, sycophant, and many others.
Some fictionists instinctively begin the names of a
remarkable proportion of their bad or mean charac-
ters with an “S.” Hence such a remarkable trio as
Smike, Squeers and Snawley in “Nicholas Nickleby,”
the two Brasses (Sampson and Sally) in “The Old
Curiosity Shop,” one Wegg (Silas) m Our Mutual
Friend,” Uncle Silas, of Le Fance s horrible yarn,
and Stiggins (who was a Shepherd) in “Pickwick.
Also Sikes (Bill), synonym of all the murderers of
the past half-century. Even Pecksniff was a ease
in point, for it wasn’t the peck but the sniff which
brought him low.
Smith also begins with “S,’ and so does Schmidt.
To this sinister list may be added Solomon (the
most wholesale bigamist in history), Shylock (who
typifies usury), Sharp (Becky) and Sairey (Gamp).
But for this one disastrous and objectionable
letter there could have been no serpent in Genesis,
and consequently no sin. Whether, however, by
abolishing it and substituting something in the
nature of a “th” it would be possible to get back
to nudity, primeval innocence and the year One is
another question.

“Seno.jo” : Eight in the centre of a Mel-
bourne “prohibition” district, theoretically
and by law so dry that yawning cracks
should spread across the arid landscape, one
of the high priests of anti-wassail keeps a roof
over his tea-urn. With monotonous regu-
larity the flower-beds are littered nightly
with empty beer-bottles, to the extreme
annoyance of tbe virtuous bouseholdei when
he emerges to collect his morning paper.
The idea is that every homeward-bound wan-
derer from the nearest oasis outside the
area treats the garden as a ballot-box ami
therein registers a vote for Bacchus, inci-
dentally making a donation to the local
bottle-o, who has to make periodical visits
to save the establishment from being snowed,
or rather, bottled, under. Police vigilance
has so far failed to detect the depositors;
but a party of bibulous youths were landed
the other evening for serenading the house
raucously with : “Here’s to good old water,
drink it down, drink it down. The man
who drinks it oughter be dipped right m
the Yarra till he drown.”

“Billtong’s” tragedy of the dawn: —
Binks and his wife were staying with some
straight-laced friends in a Sydney suburb, and the
•other evening the former got on a jag in
town with Bloggs, who happens to reside in the
same locality. It was a very jaggy kind of jag, and
the coming dawn found the pair driving home round
the bridges in a taxi —Binks on the seat, Bloggs on
the floor. Arrived in front of his temporary domi-
cile Binks lurched out of the vehicle, paid the
driver and wobbled towards the gate. “Where’ll I
take yer friend, sir?” asked the shover. “Frien’?”
roared Binks. “What frien’ ? Never had a frien’
in m’ life!” “He’s here in the cab, sir.” “No
frien’ mine. Never heard of him. Do whatcher like
with him —drop him down sewer.” The ensuing
argument resounded through the neighborhood and
brought forth Mrs. Binks, with a kim. over her
nightie and red slippers on her stockingless feet.
When she had calmed the storm she looked at the
snoring figure in the taxi and recognised Bloggs,
though she had met him but once. “Come on, driver,”
said the big-hearted woman, “I think I know where
he lives; we’ll take him home. You sit there,
John, and don’t move till I come back.” Ten
minutes later Mrs. Bloggs, hearing a scuffling on
her front lawn, looked out of her bedroom window
and in the dim dawn-light descried her lord and
master encircled by the arms of a strange and

tousled-headed woman in a bedraggled kimono and
immoral-looking slippers. With the first creak
of the opening door Mrs. Binks, suddenly panicky,
fled. And when she got back to her John and the
home of her wowser friends she found that the door
had slammed. More bedraggled and wild-eyed than
ever she held Binks with one arm as she rang the
bell. By the time every milkman in the suburb had
grinned at them over the fence the door was opened
by their Calathumpian host, who had slept through
the earlier rumpus. The poor gentleman has con-
fided to a fellow-churchman that the Bacchanalian
tableau that greeted him on his own doormat will
haunt him till he dies.

“Catamain” on the vagaries of the com-
pilers of electoral rolls: —
Whenever election-time draws
nigh contributors to different
papers examine and comment on
occupations as scheduled in the
electoral rolls, sometimes remark-
ing on the lack of candor which
makes “no occupation’’ a very
rare classification. Nevertheless
it’s sometimes dashed hard to get
oneself accurately described. When
I became entitled to vote I was
still an inmate of a hospital, seri-
ously and permanently disabled as
the result of a long illness, and
totally without resources. On my
claim for Federal enrolment I
stated that 1 had no occupation.
The local postmaster refused to
accept that, remarking that hav-
ing no occupation wasn’t one. He
next demanded what I had last
worked at. When I told him that
I had been a postal official but
had to resign on account of pro-
tracted illness, he recognised that
this had ceased to be my calling,
but could not be persuaded that
I should be enrolled as having no
occupation; so I left him in tor-
ment with his problem. When the
rolls were published I found my-
self described as being of inde-
pendent means. The police, in
enrolling me for the State, saved
themselves a headache by describ-
ing me as a laborer.
“Winkle”: My entry for the Malaprop
Stakes is a starting-price bookmaker, who
bets with his fellow-employees in a large
Government department in Melbourne. Re-
cently he came up to do business with some
of his clients as they were discussing Uriah
Heep, and was asked for his. opinion. My
favorite blanky book,” he said, boisterously,
“I’ve read ‘Maria Heep, the Escaped Nun,’’
five times.” The same sportsman had reason
to suspect a creditor of purposely keeping;
out of his way. His ooening remark, when
they did meet, was, “I’ve took a jerry to
you, Steve. A man don’t want a magnet to
see through a cove of your stamp.”

act in the legal drama. When the defendant
first faced the music a bench, of J’s.P. found

there was an appeal to the Supreme Court,
which ordered a rehearing. This time the
plaintiff got the decision. The alleged parent
promptly appealed, and Judge Williams dis-

THE HENRY LAWSON
MEMORIAL.
We have received the following—
Town Hall, Sydney,
3/11/1922.
The Editor “The Bulletin,” Sydney.
Dear Sir,—At the last meeting of the
Executive Committee of the Henry Law-
son Memorial Fund it was decided that
the memorial should take the form of a
statue, and if sufficient funds are avail-
able also to provide a scholarship at the
Sydney University.
It was resolved that the Lord Mayor
should open a fund, that the press be
asked to open their columns for sub-
scriptions, and that “The Bulletin” be
asked to open a special “Bulletin” Henry
Lawson Fund, owing to that paper’s
association with Henry Lawson’s work,
and its unique circulation.
In pursuance of this resolution, the
Lord Mayor desires me to ask if you can
see your way to open a subscription
list in your columns. The Lord Mayor
feels that your help in this direction
will materially assist the fund, and will
be highly appreciated by the Executive
Committee.
Yours faithfully,
W. G. LAYTON,
Joint hon. sec. Henry Lawson Memorial
Fund.
Contributions should bo addressed to The
Bulletin Office, Sydney, and endorsed

TOOHEY'S,
“Randolph Rentless”: The big ragshops
continue to eat up city blocks in Sydney.
In Park-street the walls of Palmer’s and
Murdoch’s have met. In George-street Mur-
doch’s. Lowe’s and Gowing's have been
spreading till they monopolise the greater
part of the block front. Anthony Horderns’
has leapt the lane that used to be its back
entrance, and is putting up a solid new
building on the other side. Farmer’s, having
spread from Pitt-street into George-street, is
about to upheave another extension on the
corner where it ate away Roberts’s Hotel.
And David Jones has a building in prospect
which is going to eclipse them all. Time
was when hotel property was the most valu-
able in the city; but since the girls have
started to collar the men’s jobs haberdashery
pays a lot better than beer.
* * * *
The optimism of “L.E.” :
Buying pictures under the terms of the Felton
bequest has never been a thankful job. Desirable
pictures come into the London or Paris market in
the most haphazard way or don’t come at all. The
purchaser, for example, may want a Gainsborough;
but, possibly, there may be no Gainsborough at the
time, and, instead, a good Degas may have come to
light. But if he wants a Degas or Manet, neither
may appear, though there may be a chance for
a decent Old Master or a representative ultra modern.
NATURALLY.
“I am terribly misunderstood by my husband!”
"Of coarse! He toouldn’t have married you otherwise!
The purchaser may have quite a good plan in his
head as to what should be suitable for the Mel-
bourne National Gallery; but he has to depend for
its execution on the caprice of the market. He
may have to buy what lie can get, not what he wants,
trusting to Providence that each picture may ulti-
mately fit into its proper place in a national collec-
tion. Kinder’s latest purchase, the Van Dyck, can-
not possibly look worth its money seen by itself.
It needs t l, e support of other primitives, which may
not come along for a generation. The Van Dyck
holds its own very well in mixed company; but the
Gainsborough is not a first-class example, though
it is better than the feeble Reynolds, Hoppner and
other 18th-century works. The Jan Steen interior
is a satisfactory example of solid Dutch painting
of the best period. The Gustave Courbet landscape,
with its stark black trees on a hillside covered with
dirty snow, is not generally popular, but it seems
to me a strong and characteristic work. Courbet
is the most realistic of all realists. He despised
conventional ideas of'beauty, and contended that it
didn’t matter what was painted if it were painted
well. It is not easy to get a good collection of
the best 19th-century French masters: they are at
once bought up for American galleries. In a small
exhibition in London I saw a landscape by Monet,
a much better picture than the one we have, a
fine nude by Renoir and a splendid Gauguin, and
wanted them all for Melbourne. The prices were
stiff enough, but they will be much stiffer next
time such pictures appear. However, Melbourne is
bolder than it used to be, and with just a little luck
and reasonable judgment, it should have one of the
best collections out of London in a few years.

“Ragar”: The Brahmin lady at Lahore,
India, who has just added to the colored
population of the world by five, didn’t put
up a record, as alleged by the cables.
It is only about a year ago that
one Enriquita Ruibo, a native of Tam-
pico, Mexico, is reported to have staggered
her husband and the Mexico City Medical
Association by giving the domestic quiver a
kick-off with eight. And shortly before the
war a titled Austrian lady presented her
husband with one child in the first year of
married life, twins in the second, triplets in
the third, and so on, tip to a septet in the
seventh year. After which, no doubt, to
the astounded man’s relief, she died. Twenty-
eight children by one woman in seven years
is, according to Austrian medical men, the
present world’s record.

“Nimshi”: Touching the Digger’s alleged
power of expressing himself in lurid phrase-
ology (B. 30/11/’22). This gift, if general in
the A.1.F., must have been attained abroad, for,
as a rule, the Australian in his native wilds
is a man of few words, most of them scan-
dalously overworked. Henry Lawson, in one
of his sketches, introduces an individual
whose sole linguistic enterprise appears to
be “My oath !” and I can vouch for it that
his kind is not unique. In any gang of
navvies or amongst shed-hands, the Irish-
man or the Cockney is generally looked-up
to as a vituperative expert, and it is a
common thing during “off” hours to see half-
a-dozen natives sitting at the feet of such
worthies memorising their casual output for
future use. In the cities it may be different,
but to claim for the outback Aussie a talent
as a careless slinger of scathing repartee—
tut, tut!

“Sierra” hitches up his slacks and turns
to:
Boyd Cable is hauling on the
wrong rope when he talks (B.
30/11/’22) of the Cutty Bark
carrying thousands of emigrants
to Australia. The vessel was built
as a tea-carrier, pure and simple,
but the opening of the Suez Canal
in 1869 (the year she was
launched) dispersed the fleet; of
China clippers, and, in the early
’seventies, the Cutty Sark com-
menced voyaging to Australia,
carrying general cargo out and
wool home. The remarkably fast
time made by her in 28 passages
as a wool-clipper was partly due
to the driving capabilities of her
skippers. Her crews found her a
pretty tough little craft to handle,
and as for passengers, a deeply-
laden 810-ton clipper, with no
freeboard to speak of, storming
along under all she can carry in
the roaring ’forties, is certainly
no place for them. During the
time she was making her pheno-
menal passages the little vessel
slipped in and out of port as un-
obtrusively as a timber-scow. She
was never in the limelight like
her flash, passenger-carrying sis-
ters of the Money Wigram, Black-
wall and Aberdeen Clipper lines.
The bands and bunting were re-
served for them because they did
carry passengers. The fact is,
outside shipping circles, the Cutty
Bark was practically unknown
until, in the course of time, she
outlived all the old-timers, and
journalists commenced writing her
up. That writing having saved
the ancient vessel from the ship-
breaker’s hands, the ■ thanks of
seamen all over the world are
due to the writers. For, indeed, she is a wonderful
old ship.

“T. 0.1.”: Temple Court, with frontages
of 00 feet each to King and Elizabeth streets,
Sydney, has changed hands for £65,000. One
hundred years ago the corner was occupied
bv the house of a solicitor, James
Norton, and here in 1824 was born the late
James Norton, M.K.C., also a solicitor.
When Norton, sen., went to live at Els wick
House, on the Parrainatta-road, the man-
sion on the corner was opened as The Three
Tuns Tavern bv Richard Driver, a Sydney
native, father of “Dick” Driver, a sporting
and political solicitor. The elder Dick, who
was a city councillor, held the license until
about 1860. Some years later the old house
was demolished and Temple Court built on
the site. With Temple Court is associated
the name of Tom Curran, who at one time
kept the Oxford Hotel. Tom and a son
went to Ireland and joined the Home Rule
party. The father sat for South Sligo, the
son for Donegal North.

“Dinklii Dili”: “Pro’s”' Moonshiners (B.
30/11/’22) were not faced with anything like
the problem that confronted some cob-
bers of mine at Tillers in TB. There
was nothing left of the village ex-
cept the cellars, and these were well pick-
eted. At this stage my mob salvaged a
cask of the “oil of gladness,” but were puzzled
as to how they would get the stuff away to a
suitable spot for absorption. An old mule
which had been skittled provided the solution,
and, with the goods done up inside, was
carted off for interment. “What’s the pro-

cession?” challenged the S.M. “Burial party,
sir,” replied the chief mourner; “just
cleaning up a bit.” “Commendable zeal,” re-
marked the other suspiciously. “More like a
wake, judging by the attendance.” "Wrong
again,” chuckled the sexton, when out of
hearing, “it’s a Masonic funeral,” and he
made cryptic signs to a group of idlers that
brought them eagerly into the corthge.

“Dialsight” on Time’s changes:-
1 never encounter Blinks the shopwalker, in his frock
coat, spats and the other spruce indications of his
genteel calling, without remembering a certain night
in Egypt. Blinks was “waiting-man,” otherwise
first emergency and general oif-sider to the guard.
It was raining heavily, when a yell from the sentry
turned a couple of us out in a hurry. AVe found a
terrified Gyppo crouching under a gun-waggon. We
were new chums, and the sarge had vision's of'
espionage. He decided eventually to keep our captive
till the morning. The odds were on his sneaking
under the tent flaps, if left untied, so various expedi-
ents were discussed, amongst them that of
tethering the poor wretch to the tent pole. Finally
one ingenious warrior, detecting weaknesses in the
tent-pole scheme, suggested tethering him to Blinks.
The resolution was carried, and put into force, with
only one dissentient. And there our prisoner lay
all night, exuding steam from his filthy gabardine,
fretful as a porcupine, and smelling like a
back alley of the Wazzir, attached by a short
cord to the wrist of my now immaculate friend
who at the delicate art of ushering a female denizen
of Toorak to a chair at the underclothing counter, is
without a peer in Melbourne.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I passed a beggar in the street,
And did no« give him of my store;
Then stopped a dear old friend to greet,
And of the blind man thought no more.
We talked of times now long since past,
When life was better than to-day,
For when men reminisce, at last
The talk will always turn that way.
And you’d have thought I’d dream that night
Of memories our speech aroused ;
Instead, I dreamed I’d lost my sight,
And begged, unfed, unloved, unhoused.

“Bimbo” : An untoward interjection deflated
much of the gaseous enthusiasm of “Pussy-
foot” Johnson at his meeting in Wanganui

In pre-Federation days few men were
more widely known in Australia than
Clement Bindley Wragge, who has just gone
out in Maoriland. From 1887 till 1902 he
was Queensland’s Government Meteorolo-
gist, but Australia looked on him as her own.
He used to issue forecasts for the continent,
and they were read as much for their char-
acteristic phraseology as for their meteor-
ological value. His habit was to christen
atmospheric disturbances and quaintly endow
them with personalities. Townsville and
Bowen (Q.) particularly remember liis
“Sigma” and “Leonta,” which practically
flattened them out. Wragge was from the
first an enthusiast. He instituted a Museum
of Ethnography, Geology and National His-
tory at Stafford (Eng.), and gave it to the
country; founded Ben Nevis Observatory,
then came to Australia, and he had started
observatories at Adelaide, Mt. Lofty (S.A.)
and Mt. Wellington (Tas.) before he got
his Bananaland job. The observatories on
Mt. Kosciusko (N.S.W.) and New Cale-
donia can also call him “Dad.” In 1910 he
settled in Maoriland, where he established
the Wragge Scientific Museum and Waiata
Botanic Gardens. The picturesque old chap
had just rounded off the Psalmist’s three
score years and ten when the end came.

“The Deacon’s” memory :
There died the other day in England Moore Richard
Nelligan, one-time Anglican Bishop of Auckland
(M.L.)'.' He was a Dublin man, a parson’s son and
a graduate of Trinity; and he and the R.O. Bishop
of Auckland, George Michael Lenihan, became fast
friends. They shocked the M.L. wowsers by declar-
ing jointly and severally for Sunday sport once the day
had been sanctified by some form of religious observ-
ance. The sight of the two soul-salvagers smoking
their pipes cheek-by-jowl on the tuppenny tram was
a bitter pill for the bigots who held that such a dis-
play of Christian spirit between clerics of differing
denominations meant weakness in the faith. Lenihan
went west 1b 1910, and before long Nelligan threw off
the M.L. apron and leggings, arid sought the quiet
of an English rectory. A fine horseman, keen
cricketer and clean sport—and only 60 when the
bells tolled.
Frederick Lang, Maoriland’s Speaker,
outed at last week’s elections by the Labor
candidate for Manakau, had been in the
House ever since the year of Dick Seddon’s
novitiate as Premier. Originally he had
been chairman of the Tutukaramea-road
Board, or something, but his long suit was
an intimacy with the Maori land laws, and
this carried him through the dismal shadows
of Seddonian rule, until the Conservatives
came into their own again. Lang followed
Arthur Guinness as Speaker, and, like Guin-
ness and Steward before him, sported a ziff.
He made a nice, prim little Speaker, spin-
sterish, well-meaning and squeaky.
M. M. Phillips has scored again, _ and
becomes a member of the Melb. ’Var-
sity Council. As a student he won
every degree he sought. Then he tried
for the job of Taxing Master and Chief
Clerk of the Supreme Court, and got it.
He determined to be Chief President of
the A.N.A., secured election to the board
of directors, and in due course stepped up.
Phillips, by the way, holds that Higin-
botham was one of Australia’s few really
great men.

After 25 years’ service as Chief Inspector
of Coal Mines and General Superintendent
of State Coal Mines in N. S. Wales, A. A.
Atkinson retires at the end of the year.
Coming from a well-known coal-mining
family in the North of England (his father
and two brothers monopolised the job of
Chief Inspector of Coal Mines for about 70
years), Atkinson has had nearly half-a-cen-
tury’s experience of coal in Great Britain,
India and Australia. He was a colliery
manager in India and England for 16 years
—six of them in charge of the Barrow Col-
lieries in South Yorkshire, with an output
of 500,000 tons a year. As Chief Inspector
in N. S. Wales he has handled all phases
of colliery administration, and even when
occasionally compelled to perform unpleasant
duties as against employers or employees, he
still retained the friendship of all concerned.
Atkinson was general superintendent of the
State coal-mine at Lithgow for five years,
and the fact that this colliery has now be-
come a coal-producer despite all the delays
in developmental work is a tribute to his
knowledge of the game. Still hale and ener-
getic, he will probably continue to do his bit
in the interests of the industry after he has
finally closed his official desk.
Bert Roach, who edits the S. Aus. Educa-
tion Gazette and also conducts Tiie
Children’s Hour, one of the most popular
of school magazines, was 58 on Dec. 12.
He was born at Penwortham, the S. Aus.
village where Horrocks, the explorer, lived.
Probably this accounts to some extent for
his great interest in Australian explorers of
whom he has written with the authority born
of full knowledge. Roach is one of the best
equipped and most advanced of 8. Australian
educationists, but it’s his bad luck that the
authorities at Adelaide don’t adequately pay
for brains. Queensland offered Roach a better
billet some years ago, and he’s sorry now he
didn’t accept it.
“Wilfrido”: The Copley Medal for Atomic
Research goes to Ernest Rutherford,
Maoriland’s most famous scientist. He was
born at Nelson over 50 years ago, went to
Nelson College and thence, on a ’Varsity
scholarship to Canterbury College, where he
collected an M.A., a B.Sc. and an 185,1
Exhibition Science Scholarship. At Cam-
bridge, he picked up a D.Sc., an LL.D., an-
other B.A. Research Degree and a Ph.D.
Since then he has gained numerous further
honors (including the Nobel Prize for Chem-
istry in 1907), held various professorships
and become the greatest living authority on
radio-activity.
Edmund Richard Herald, the last of the
men who opened the railway system of New
South Wales, from Sydney to Parramatta,
in 1555, passed out on the first of this month
at the age of 91. “Bully,” as he Was nick-
named, not for his aggressiveness, but because
he was regarded as a typical John Bull Eng-
lishman, was the first station-master at New-
town, and collected the first railway passen-
ger ticket issued from Sydney. He retired
from the service in 1891, being then s.m. at
Singleton. Most of his service was on the
Northern line, where he rose to be inspector,
a job he finally relinquished for something
less strenuous. There were few better-liked
railwaymen in his day than old “Bully.”
The Westralian Rhodes Scholar for 1923,
H. S. Murphy, of Kalgoorlie High School
and Perth ’Varsity, is a brother to V. S.
Murphy, Rhodes Scholar for 1921. Both
brothers have acquired practically all their
learning on scholarships.
Several Victorian officials are getting
their screws raised. Mclver, Closer-settle-
ment chairman, is having £5OO tacked
on to the £1250 he now draws; Detliridge
and Shaw 7 , Water Commissioners, are to go
up from £lOOO to £1250, and Cattenach,
Chief Water Commissioner, is pretty sure to
have from £250 to £5OO added to his £l5OO.
Norris, Auditor-General, goes from £lOOO to
£1250; Barr, chairman of the Licenses Re-
duction Board, from £BOO to £lOOO, and his
two fellow-members from £BOO to £9OO each.
A. T. Sharp, sec. of Vic.’s New Settlers’
League, who died the other day, will be
specially missed because of his close grip
of immigration. He knew it from both ends,
10 years at Australia House as the State’s
immigration officer contributing largely to
his experience. He died in Melbourne just
12 months after returning to Victoria. A
flying visit to Geelong to see his 90-year-old
mother (still living) was the only respite
he took before getting into harness again
at Collins House. Sharp and his wife (who
passed out in Sept, last) did great work
for the Diggers in London during the war.
He was the originator of the Anzac Pil-
grimage, and before leaving England saw
that £5OO was earmarked to carry on the
work of tending Aussie graves.
“Centurion”: Many Bananalanders will be
sorry to hear of the stiff luck of Lt.-Col.
Kelly, V.C., D. 5.0., etc., referred to by
“Xox” (B. 7/12/’22). Kelly, an ex-
Imperial officer, blew into Brisbane from
now n here in particular, before the S’African
War, and went away as C.O. of the Third
Q.M.1., which later gained fame by a stand
against great odds at Elands River. Born
soldier though he was, Kelly’s temperament,
or something, shifted him from the Q.M.I.
to another job. Later, he returned to
Queensland, and wrote a letter to the Courier
cursing the military heads for sending
him his war-medals through the post, and
announcing that on a certain day he would
publicly present a trooper of his old regi-
ment with his medal on Brisbane P.O. steps,
after which the trooper would pin Kelly’s
decorations on, with appropriate remarks. I
left Brisbane before the day fixed for the
ceremony, but have no doubt it occurred.
What Kelly said he would do he mostly did.
Both Vic. Houses of Parliament passed
appreciative addresses to Cussen, J., for
his work on the Imperial Acts, and handed
them to him at a Parliamentary luncheon.
Thus the, Government made up a little to
’S’onor for passing him over when the C.J.-
ship was; vacant. The story is current that
Cussen, who is off on a trip to England,
has been recommended for a superior sort of
knighthood (lie is only a Iv.B. now), or a
Privy Councillorship, for consolidating the
Statutes.
“Sirocco”: Alek Sass was regarded by
his respectable acquaintances as owing his
weedy stature to the cigarette habit. He
was certainly an awful consumer of fags,
but he once took the drastic step of having
himself locked up for 48 hours without his
favorite brand, and though the result wasn’t
wholly successful, it proved he had the will
to cut the craving whenever he liked. In
Melbourne Sass was helpful to many black-
and-whiters who now get their names in
the papers, and his school was a rest-home
for assorted youths of varied artistic tastes.
One was a half-loony student from the
National Gallery, who claimed to be a great
amateur boxer with a “good-night” punch in
either hand. The news flew round, and good-
natured Frank Brown, who has pushed
gloves into numerous countenances, was en-
gaged to try out the aspirant in a chalked
square in Sass’s studio. The novice, of
course, proved a dud, but Frank allowed him-
self to be punched round the ring, and took
the count most artistically amid an over-
whelming demonstration in favor of the
victor.
Two old St. Peter’s College and Adelaide
’Varsity boys recently became fellows of the
Royal College of Surgeons, London. One
is I. B. Jose, M.C., son of Canon Jose, rector
of Christ Church, North Adelaide. He was
born in China in ’93, came to S. Aus. when
10, and after getting his M.B. degree at the
’Varsity in ’l5, went out where the guns
were shooting. The other i* L. C. E. Lin-
den, S. Aus. Rhodes Scholar for 1919, and
son of the late J. H. Linden, who was one
of the masters of St. Peter’s. He also
donned khaki, and in 1918 won the Davies
Thomas Scholarship.
“S.T.S.” : General Bridges, the new Gover-
nor of S.A., brought two messages with him.
The Prince of Wales told him “I loved Adelaide,
and they will give you a jolly warm wel-
come.” Marshal Foch sent for him to
Paris to talk over past and future, and
wrote, “Say t o
those valiant war-
riors of Australia
that their memory
is ever green in
France, and that
we will witness to
this by the reverent
care with which we
will surround the
graves of their
de a d.” The Gen-
eral is a very
tall man of 50-odd,
with a big record
both in war and in
diplomacy. He left
a leg in France,
but the loss is not
noticeable. In fact,
he plays golf and
rides. But he has
had regretfully to
give up steeple-
chasing and polo.
LAWSON, Vic-
torian State
Premier.
When Vic. Auditor-General Norris was a
telegraph-operator Premier J. B. Patterson
once told him that he would some day draw
£l5OO a year. He has £250 to go yet. Re-
cently he got a rise of a fiver a week. Norris
began work as a telegraph-messenger in
1885, when he was 13.
Aikman’s portrait in oils has now been
added to those of other Mayors at Melb.
Town Hall. During the ceremony Aikman
looked thoughtful—maybe he was thinking of
the knighthood he didn’t get, after all the ex-
pense he was put to in connection with the
Prince’s visit. Or, again, he may have been
brooding over the Ministership, the lost Par-
liamentary seat, and a few other things.
Aikman’s road to wealth was at times steep,
especially in the days when he kept drapery
stores at Dimboola and Bairnsdale.
“Leichhardt”: New Plymouth (M.L.)
possesses the oldest living married couple born
in the Dominion ; they celebrated their dia-
mond wedding this year. “Darby,” or George
Hollard, was born in Wellington in 1842. It
is claimed for him that he helped to found
the first co-operative dairy factory in Maori-
land. “Joan” (nee Keys) was born in
Wellington in 1841, her father having come
with the first survey party in 1839 from
the U.K. The population of cow-spanking
Taranaki are exceedingly proud of their
record-holders.
“J.H.” (London) : Robert Donald’s resig-
nation from the committee of the British
Empire Exhibition after scarifying the exe-
cutive for their wobble over allowing foreign
products to compete with Empire supplies
on the caterer’s menu, has thrown some
much-needed light on the peculiar methods
of these. Empire “boosters,” and has rendered
Australia and the other Dominions a real
service. He is the proprietor of the Referee
and principal shareholder in the Daily
Chronicle, chief organ of the late Coali-
tion Government and now the organ of
Lloyd George and his National Liberals. He
also has a finger in many other Fleet-street and
provincial newspaper deals, and is a real
power behind the throne in British politics.
The Dominions have no more able, disin-
terested and powerful friend.
Robert Barr, of Magill (Adelaide), who
has just entered his 91st year, is a Scot who
married at 21, and worked for millionaire
John Gordon, of Aikenhead, near Glasgow,
for 2s. 6d. a day, on which he had to keep a
large family. Being the champion plough-
man of his district, however, he commanded
a higher rate than most of his fellow work-
men, who got Is. 6d. to 2s. a day. In ’74
Barr landed in Australia with his wife and
10 children, and went farming in the lower
north of S. Aus. Afterwards he made money
growing barley on Kangaroo Island. Barr
and his wife reared a family of 14 children,
and there are 70 grandchildren and over 100
great-grandchildren. The ancient is still
active, and though he now finds he “gets a
bit lazy sometimes,” he is confident of top-
ping the century.
EXIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He looked around and whimpered oft,
And oft he sighed and shed a tear;
He cast his bleary eyes aloft,
And said, with voice grown strangely soft,
“They do not understand me here.”
He thought of happy days gone by—
The war-days when his might was great;
When, perched upon a platform high,
He urged men on to bleed and die,
With hymns of unrelenting hate.
A devil nonchalantly came
And slung him into Furnace 4 ;
Then turned, and on the Roll of Shame
Inscribed beside a well-known name:
“Another cow who won the war.”

“Bonita”: One of the weirdest scraps I
ever saw was put up between a half-grown kangaroo
and au old warrior of a game rooster. For a long
time the Too had spent hours every day "chipping”
iat the old cock through the garden netting, till
one afternoon (the family being absent) the lads of
the station slipped the old bird over the fence. The}
THE HEDGER.
AFFABLE STRANGER: “By Jove, your name's Smith, isn't it? I
used to know you well in Adelaide."
SMI TH: "Well, my name isn't Smith till I know what you want."
AFFABLE STRANGER ( slightly dashed ): "I only thought you
might oblige me with a pound till to-morrow."
SMITH: “In that case my name isn’t Smith all this week.”
got down to biz at once. The Too tried to rip with
his toenails, at the same time making wild grabs
with his forearms. But the old rooster was an
adept at sidesteps, and every time Joey missed with
toe or forepaw the feathered Dempsey got him in
the neck with bill and spurs, though the Too was
fully twice his height. The climax came when Joey
bounced away into a corner with the rooster in full
pursuit, dealing it out as he went. But evidently
flic old bird hadn’t heard of the worm that turned,
or else triumph made him careless for, all at once,
the Too grabbed him desperately. There were
two lightning toe swipes, and Joey, with a whistle
of fright, bounced clean over his enemy and cowered
in another corner, while the poor old warrior of
a hundred battles flapped around so badly “gapped”
that we had to finish him off with an axe.
“Frank Dee”: I saw an amazing instance
of canine nous once at the Whangarei (M.L.) sheep-
dog trials. It was the longhead and yarding compe-
tition. and the dog, one Paddy, had to put three
sheep in the yard. He got them up to the gate and
there they stood back-on to the opening and re-
fused to budge. Unable to bark, without losing
points, Pat put liis trick across. He walked solemnly
up and gently scratched one sheep down the face
with his paw. The jumbuek backed into the y ard;
the rest was easy, and —Patrick took first prize.
* * * *
"Murranji”: Re “Barcoo’s” say-so (B.
10/11/’22), that it is usual for Gulf drovers to hang
lanterns on stakes or trees around touchy cattle at
night. Just now I’m up on the Flinders. I have
been at the game for years and have followed the
hornies in all parts of the State —on open downs
and sandhill country, in brigalow scrubs of the
Moonie and ti-tree forests of the Gulf —and this is
the first time I’ve heard that we Gulf and western
drovers do that sort of thing. I have always found
that cattle —especially bullocks —camp better on a
dark camp. I just dread moonlight nights with a
bad mob; and I’m wondering what some of our big-
gun drovers like Doug. Cameron, Albert t\ illiams,
Walter Rose, etc., think of “Barcoo’s” statement.
He is correct when he says cattle camp better if
the man on watch sings or whistles; but with lights
all round them —well someone else can. take my
watch 1
* * * *
“Russ”: in the Lockhart (N.S.WA dis-
trict the other day a farmer read his small daughtei,
aged six, a long lecture on some mischief she had
done. She heard him through to the bitter end
without comment, then went to her mother and
with tears in her eyes, said: “Mummy, I’m sorry
we married this old blanker —aren’t you?”
“W.A.0.”: If “Mag” (B. 19/10/’22) looks
up Leach’s “Australian Bird Book” he will find
that the painted-snipe, Australian rhynchaea (Rostra-
tula australis), breeds in Australia, but the Austra-
liar.-snipe (Japanese, Latham), jack-snipe, bleatcr.
long-bill ( OalKnago australis) breeds in Japan; so
it is, properly speaking, not an Australian bird.
The birds travel mostly at night during their migra-
tion to avoid birds of prey, and are seldom seen,
although they- may be heard calling as they pass
high overhead.
• * * •
“Barcoo”: “Trevdee’s” jumping jumbuek
(B. 16/11 /’22) that negotiated a fence 4ft. Tin. is
a classy performer, hut sheep
arc much better leapers than
the majority of people, even
sheep-men, imagine. If they
arc allowed to revert towards
their original ancestor, a goat-
like mountain-sheep, their
flectness and leaping qualities
show up amazingly. And there
is no domestic animal that re-
verts so rapidly. This is
peculiarly noticeable in the
huge Bananaland sheep-runs tar
back, with paddocks ranging
up to 20 miles square. Small
lots of sheep generally fail to
muster at the round-up for trie
annual shearing, and in a
generous year or two following
shearing those out-back hold-
ings are often not utilised.
There have been instances of
small lots remaining unmo-
lested for eight or nine years,
with in-breeding taking place
all the time. The deteriora-
tion of wool-sheep is very re-
markable, and when the woolly
scrubbers are eventually yarded
the fleet ness of foot they have
acquired in the interim will
try the pace of the musterers’
mounts. At Wellshot station
(C.Q.) 1 recently watched a
merino wether jump the inter-
vening 16 peiw, which meant
31 obstacles 3ft. lOin. high,
from the front of the shed to
the back, taking each leap in
its stride without hesitation.
To make sure it was no fluke
the shed-overseer had him put
back, and he did it just as
neatly the second time. Inci-
dentally, some breeds are not
only of a wilder strain than
others, but it requires a taller
piece of timber to check their
jumping in the drafting yards.
Merinos of the Tasmanian type,
when reared on the larger and
wider pastures of Bananaland,
are noted in this respect, just
as the South Australian breed
is in exactly the opposite direction, having adopted
the docility of one of its long-wool ancestors
(Leicester) introduced in the years that are gone.

“C.R.D.”: Despite what “X.R.M.0.” says
(B. 30/11/’22) re the capacity of a pig, .1 for one
—and I think “Moralist” and others will stick to
me —shall be content to remain an idiot, congenital
or otherwise.. On a Paterson River (N.S.W.) dairy
in 1915, I left a kerosene-tin full of separated milk
outside the sty r . Returning 10 minutes later I was
astonished at the sight of the nether end of a
1.51 b. sucker wobbling drunkenly over the edge of
the tin. The rest of porky was well inside the tin,
and all but. a quart of the milk was well inside
porky. He had drunk as far as he could reach,
probably half-way, and then dived in after more.
1 pulled him out, so I don’t know if he’d have
drowned gloriously in, or drunk the balance; but,
like Oliver Twist, he grunted for “more” when I
went about feeding his cobbers. I’ll admit I’m beat
A USEFUL MAX OX A MINE.
CAP’N: “Want me for to give ’ec job , (to 'ee? Well, what can
'ee do?”
STRANGER (who has been put wise): "I can play a church -organ
well, sir.”
CAP'N: "Come, ready for to start first thing 'morrow mornin',
in' son.”
to explain how 151 b. of pig and 351 b. of milk com-
bined got into the space occupied by the original
351 b. of milk—but I’ll swear it happened. I don’t
know what the grunter weighed after the operation,
but, I know that all but, say, 51b. of hindquarters
(and not more) was inside the bucket. As to
“X.R.M.O.’s” remark about weighing before and
after drinking beer, let that gentleman try his own
experiment with a good square roast-beef dinner in-
stead of the beer. .Nine times out of ten the scoffer
will find himself not heavier, but actually lighter.
And that's an open challenge.
* * * #
“Derf Commor”: “Pat Bushie’s” yarn
(B. 16/11/’22) about the big bullocky and the
diminutive chop reminds me of an old Cousin Jack
of Charters Towers (Q.). Going down from Towns-
ville to Rockhampton by boat with the Towers
band he remarked to the steward at the first meal,
“I’ll have a bit of fish, boy. - ’ The menial brought
him in a large plate, with a small piece of fish
reposing on the centre of it. Jack looked non-
plussed for a moment, then, impaling the fish with
his fork, he lifted it into the cavity under his nose,
and commenced to chew. After a couple of seconds
contemplative mastication, lie turned to the steward
and remarked ecstatically', “That’s him, boy—l'll
have a bit of him.”

“Jimmy the R.” on a bush submarine: —
I have just had an argument with my r camp
goanna, and tried to chase him over to his own
side of the gully—which drains the mine water (as
clear as gin and impregnated with arsenic). Instead
of crossing, he deliberately turned into a small
pool, walking under the water, and stayed there.
So I timed him. He stayed under for smin. 55sec.
—allowing for the time in getting out my watch, say
a full 6min. Then he put out his head for air and
I immediately tapped him on the nose, and he went
under again. He stayed this time ihiin. 46sec. and
tried for another breath, but was tapped again.
At near the 6min. this time he began to show signs
of distress, as his left hind-leg lost its grip on Che
bottom and on that side he rose about half-an-inch ;
but he did not put his nose out until the 'watch
showed smin. 45secs. Total 16rnin. 31sec. Think-
ing he had done a fair thing in the interests of
science, I got up, intending to give him a chance
to go home; but he was a suspicious beggar and
dived again. I went back to the camp (about 12vds.
away) for my pipe and came back to see how things
were. He was still under water and apparently
had not shifted while I was away (three, or, possibly,
four minutes). Again I put the watch on him, but In
50 seconds he was up. This time for good, for he
looked at me witli a most pathetic expression that
admitted he had done his dash. Grand total, sav.
21 minutes. I left him, and a quarter of an hour
later, he started (in water ballast) for home —an
old gum-tree—but I am afraid he will have to wait
until baling operations are finished before he can
crawl up to bed.
- * * *
“Trevdee”: Droving ain’t what it used to
be. The other day at Newmarket yards (Vic.-) I
saw a fellow behind a mob of sheep coolly licking
a cone of ice-cream. It was a hot day, of course,
but —what’s wrong with beer*?
“Lenah”: “Bung” (B. 9/11/’22) says that
“Wendouree’s” green honey was garnered solely from
wattle blossoms ; yet any apiarist would tell “Bung”
that the wattle is not a honey producer. It is a
very valuable tree to
the bees, though, as it
produces huge quanti-
ties of pollen. This is
fed to the young bees,
and if pollen is not
procurable the colony
will very soon dwindle
away. Sometimes when
there is a scarcity the
beekeeper himself has
to And a substitute
for pollen—such as
peameal—to help rear
the bees. The pollen
in no way, at any
time, affects the color
of the honey. Most
of the honey gathered
by “bush bees’’ ooines
from the native gum-
trees, of which there are
many varieties, and
also the flowering box.
These at different times
of year produce vari-
ous shades of honey.

“F.J.A.”: I don’t
doubt “Bogan Bill”
(B. 16/U/’22) when
he says he measured a
41ft. Tin. kangaroo
jump. Three of us on
horseback in the Went-
worth (N.S.W.) dis-
trict., some years back,
tried to block an old
man red buck from
passing along a fence
in front of us. The
leading horseman got
right in front of him,
and the ’roo cleared
both man and horse.
The “stride” was
measured with a tape
—no guesswork. It was
41ft. 4in. The next
leap after landing was
39ft. 6in. “Boome-
rang” and “Pick” (B.
16/11/’22), who doubt
a 37ft, jump, must be
thinking of joevs.
“Jimmy Trousers”: Is there a bush sub-
stitute for soap? Some bird, beast or reptile pinched
my last piece the other day, and, until fresh sup-
plies came to hand, I felt the filthiest Christian that
ever said a swear. Surely there’s something growing
or lying around that could be used for the purpose.
Hut don’t let the Council tell me of things t|rat
have to be bought, as the nearest store is 20 mifcs
away.

“S.J.lv.’s record of a pleasant week
Here are a few accidents that occurred in one week
at a survey camp on the Murray recently: An axeman,
out after timber for pegs, slipped while alighting from
the dray, the horse jumped, and he was run over.
That afternoon another man went out with the same
horse and dray, and the horse, a colt, jumped straight
out of the harness and came home on his own. Next
day, as the party was surveying a road down a cliff,
the boss left his transit theodolite set up and guarded
by ati axeman against stray cattle. While he was
away a willy-willy came along, the man made for
shelter, and the whirlwind lifted the instrument 20
feet into the air, whence it nose-dived to utter
smash. Later, the buggy-horses bolted, though the
reins were securely tied back. Not being steeple-
chasers they balked at a small bit of brush fence
on the very edge of the cliff. Next day the party
was getting some soundings in the river in a motor-
boat without a reversing gear. In mid-stream the
motor jibbed, and they drifted down and got caught
UP AGAINST IT.
REGAN: “If yer play fair yon 'aren't got a
hope; I know damn well every card I
dealt yousel"
by the punt rope, the weight of which, as it was
being paid out from the punt, was rapidly sinking
them, when they caught the ear of the punt-man,
who reversed and got them clear. When they got
back to camp they found that one of the tents had
been burnt to the ground, and not a solitary thing
among the contents had been saved.

CLOSE CALLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The closest race I’ve ever seen,”
Said Tomkins in the bar,
“Took place between two speedy yachts—
The Bat and Morning Star.
The Bat had just beer, painted,
And, though you think it quaint,
The bloomin’ Bat just won the race
By the thickness of that paint!”
“Aw, I’ve a thing as close as that,”
McNab then had his say,
•“Out back I saw two horses race
For a hundred pounds one day.
A bee, before they started,
Stung one upon the nose—
And, s’help me Bob, that flamin’ horse
AVon by the lump that rose!”
Then Murphy glared upon McNab,
And sniffed and drank his beer.
“The way some blokes can miss their turn
Js somethin’ lnore’n queer!
To sec you shout,” continued Murph,
“In vain I’ve kept a watch.
By cripes, the closest race I've seen
By far's the blanky Scotch!”

This great Contest demonstrated the fine wearing qualities and dependability of
DUNLOP TYRES
An examination of the “ Dunlop ” Shod Cars that took part in this strenuous test reveals the fact
that these tyres came through in a remarkable condition -showing, in most instances practically
no signs of the gruelling test that they successfully withstood. It was another demonstration of
the ability of Duniops to withstand the severest of driving conditions. It’s the quality and
workmanship embodied in these tyres that ensures such results. Every motorist can rely on
satisfactory service with economy -when he fits “ Duniops.” DUNLOP RUBBER CO. of Aust. Ltd.

BREWED FROM
PURE MALT Tsf HOPS ONLY ,
“Bogan Bill” : I was recently stranded for
the night in a one-horse town that sees a train
only twice a week, and was yarning to the land-
lord of the only pub when a young cocky and his
bride —they had been married that morning—turned
up. Bung showed them to a room containing a
double and a single bed, and then came back to
me. A few minutes later the bridegroom ie-
appeared. “I say, mister,’’ he said to Bung, “you
ain’t going to put anybody else in that room, are
you?”
* * * #
“Bert X. Dig” : I want to back up “Ned
K.” (B. 16/11/’22; re half-bred dogs. The big inajo-
rity of sheep-drovers swear by the kelpie-collie cross
as first-class workers, and more dependable than
the pure-bred of either species during the mating
season. One man on this station (Mount Marlowe,
C.Q.) has a crossbred Gordon setter-kelpie that is
a first-class cattle-dog, will work sheep, set
game, tackle an old-man ’roo and retrieve
from water. The same animal is also a trick-dog—
CLARIFYING THE ISSUE.
“ Gentlemen, my opponent suggests that such things are mere pin-
pricks. But I can assure him that this pinprick is the last
straw which breaks the camel’s hack. If it is not uprooted
while still in the cradle, its venomous tongue will permeate
the very pillars of democracy, and ring up the curtain on
the deluge which will consume us all.” (Loud and con-
tinued applause .)
does anything bar talk. I’ve get a half-bred Aus-
tralian-Irish terrier myself, and will back him against
anything on four legs as watchdog or minder of
kids. As a side-line he keeps the crows from the
chicks and eggs.
“Wallah”: Good horses? Two people,
with buggy and pair, recently drove from Deniliquin
(N.S.W.) to Bundalong South (Vic.), passing through
Tocumwal, Cobram, Mulwala and Yarrawonga. Dis-
tance 100 miles ; time, from 8.30 a.m. till 11.45 p.m.
The prads were off the grass.
* * * •
“Centre”: The “ecstatic gyrations” of a
snake set to music, men-
tioned by “W.W.K.”
(B. 16/11/’22) recalls
an argument I once
had with a so-called
snake-charrier. He said
snakes were soothed
by music of any sort,
while I held that cer-
tain music irritates
them. I saw an actual
demonstration given by
a man with a cobra in
India. With his violin
he had the crawler
iairly dazed, and sway-
ing from side to side
in time with the
melody; then he
changed over to the
banjo, on which he
played the wildest kind
of jazz stuff. The
result was instantane-
ous on the snake. lie
slumped down for a
moment, as though un-
certain as to what was
happening, but a
moment later showed
every sign of anger.
Putting the banjo aside
the man resumed the
melody he was playing
before on the violin,
and this calmed the
snake at once. Within
a few moments it was
again swaying gently
backwards and for-
wards in time with the
music. That demonstra-
tion satisfied me, and
1 still stick to my
argument.
“Mag”: Tell “Sierra” (B. 23/11/’22)
that wandering albatrosses are sometimes louna
north of 40 south. After a severe storm two fisher-
men in liervey Bay (Q.), a couple of months ago,
captured one, and brought it to Maryborough. It
was placed in the pond in the local “Gardens” but
lived only a few weeks. It had evidently been
exhausted after a long flight, or was unable to get
the momemtum to lift off the sand, hence its cap-
ture. Still, a young one, its wing-spread was 9ft. 6in.
* * * *
“Pro” : Dunno about “Trevdee’s” jumping
jumbucks (13. 16/11/’22), but buck rabbits are the
latest jumping problem
that a harassed cockyocracy
has to wrestle with. At
Oakey Creek, in the Cano-
blas (N.S.W.) district, re-
cently, S. saw a flying
column of hobtailed steeple-
chasers take a three-foot
netting fence in single
file, and some of them
cleared the wire six inches
above the mesh, just for
fun. This achievement
adds, with the six inches
underground to prevent
sapping, another foot to
the farmers’ fencing pro-
blem, and incidentally ex-
plains how bunny gets into
netted paddocks.
* *
“X.Y.Z.”: The other
day i was on a long call
to a selector’s wife in
trouble, and had halted my
car for a hurried lunch
when a bullocky came
down the hill with a load
of wool. “Would you
swear any better if you
had a refresher?” I asked,
holding up ray flask.
“Swear?” said he, “that
wouldn’t ao any good;
and, anyhow, I’ve not had
a drink for six years.”
Arrived at my destination
I told the selector about
meeting this freak of th
Australian bush. He re-
plied, “Oh, that was old
Bill ; he joined the
feathery legs six years
ago, and, you know, doc-
tor, all those blokes who
take up religion go batty.”
“Jim Care w” (B.
16/11/’22) said every bul-
' locky knew the two-stick
trick for making a sulky
beast get up when it has
flopped. Well, I guess I’ve
found one bullocky who doesn’t employ the dodge.
I can see Bill down on his knees alongside the
recumbent bullock and hear his supplication.
“Strawberry, I say unto thee, arise, get up and
walk I”
“FY7”: The lofty “Shiga” (B. 23/11/22)
says that dysentery is extremely rare in Australia.
My last Knibbs shows that there were 87 deaths from
it in 1918, and the number of cases were proportion-
ately larger, of course. Dysentery was, and is, fre-
quently met with in the west of Queensland, and,
with typhoid fever, it was the chief cause of the
Bananaland Government’s action in compelling the
THE WISDOM OF AGE.
“ I'm delighted to know you made such a fine cheque, and I'm sure
a, man of your years will have more sense than to waste it
on drink.”
“ Yairs. I done it in at two-up .”
remodelling of shearing-shed sanitation, etc., on
modern lines. It is just here that “Shiga’s” assertion
that the dysentery bacillus “would have as much
chance of living in the Australian bush as any other
parasite bacillus—practically nil,” comes a thud.
Dysentery is largely a -disease of locality. An area
infected with the germ will probably infect anyone
occupying that area. This was an axiom among
medical men in South Africa in the Boer War, and
in later days the lesson was repeated in Papua.
Dysentery (diagnosed as such by Government M.O’s)
bade fair, in 1904, to wipe out the native carriers
plying between the Gira goldfield and Tamata. The
sources of infection • were ,the years-oiu rest-houses
and camping-grounds onv the track. Not till these
were burned and new houses and camps built, and in
their turn destroyed and re-located, was the disease
wiped out.
• * * *
“Hayeworray”: The cow industry loses
none of its vim in .these parts (Vic.). A 17-year
old flapper was recently given her choice of the
whole contents of a general store tor a birthday
present. The gift she selected i was a tough leg-
rope, wherewith to deal with a frisky young cow that
had been giving her trouble o’ mornings.
« » » •
“Bushman”: I don’t know if “Centre” (B.
23/li/’22) is correct when he says U.K. chemists
know nothing about the use of ; puli-balls.for stanch-
ing wounds; but I do know that every
cocky and every man on the land Should
know it. I saved a valuable draught
horse two years ago by applying the dry
powder to a bad cut in his foot from
which blood was pouring. I felt little
hope of saving the animal, but the puff-
ball was magical in its effect, setting
as an impenetrable -surface, and the horse
w y as right in no time. I got the hint
from Dr. Muskett’s “Australian Medical
Guide,” and now always keep a box of
puff-balls in my emergency cupboard.
* * <•
“Farmer”: Coincidences, is it?
A bullock belonging to a friend of mine
turned up one morning minus the best
long-distance bell in the team. My
cobber searched high and low for the
missing clatter for months, and finally
gave it up. One night during the recent 'possum
season I was walking thrcugh the same paddock
with him when we “put up’’ a wallaby. As it
hopped off we heard one old familiar clang. We
made a note- of the locality, went along next morn-
ing and found the missing bell.
* * * *
“Gossie”: Re “Gouger” (B. 30/11/’22) on
animals’ strange deaths. A few years ago on a
south-western (N.S.W.) sheep station, a flock of
sheep were being hurried through a narrow yard
on the side of a ridge. Some of the leaders fell,
and in a few minutes, before the men in charge
could grasp the situation, something like 300 were
smothered. A farmer rear Gundagai (N.S.W.) had
a big haystack into which some poddies had eaten
several caves. One windy night it collapsed, and
half-a-dozen of the calves were turned into veal. I
saw the long-dead remains of a bullock hanging from
the fork of a mountain-oak tree. Evidently in. 9.
dry season the beast had been reaching for the
leaves, and fastened itself as in a bail, then lost its
footing. When I last passed that way the body
bones had become detached, but the fork still held
the skull in a vyce-like grip, and the bark had
already commenced to grow around the' horns.
* * it *
“Bogan Bill”: The slickest offensive and
defensive alliance I ever struck was made at Tarana
(N.S.W.), when the navvies were working on the
deviation there. It was pay-night, and some hundreds
of men were busy giving Tarana a ruddy coat of
paint, when one, three sheets in the wind, stood in
front of the pub and loudly offered to fight anybody
on earth. V A quiet-looking, nuggety man, hearing
the challenge, said: “I don’t mind havin’ a cut at
yer.” The challenger looked him up and down, then
extended his hand and roared enthusiastically: “Put it
’ere, old man, and you and me’ll fight the whole
blanky town!” They shook hands gravely, and, arm-
in-arm, went looking for stoush.
* -* * *
“Murranji”: Let me assure “Ding Bhat”
(B. 9/11/’22) that my scorn was only for those
Pitt-street stockmen “who say they can name Aus-
tralia’s best horseman.” I contend that nobody can
do it, be he a stockman in Pitt-street or anywhere
else. As to “Ding Bhat’s” editor who spends his
week-ends “breaking in outlaws”; well, evidently
“D. 8.” is no stockman, else he would know that an
“outlaw” is a horse that cannot be broken. A man
may ride an outlaw, but he doesn’t break him in
by doing so. I can’t .swallow the idea that theie
are. enough outlaws “down Wagga way to keep
editors, or anyone else busy over more than one
week-end. I have travelled all over-the Gulf, N.T.
and Nor’-West, and in 30 years have seen only about
a score of dinkum outlaws. They were all old
horses.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: “Bill Bowyaug” (B.
23/11/’22) notwithstanding, “Gouger” is right when
he says (B. 19/10/’22) that he is a good man who
can cut and load three and a half tons of sugar-
cane in a day on an average. Some cutters won t
average two tons a day, when cutting on wages!
As for records, some years ago two gun cutters
near Bundaberg (Q.) hustling for a wager, cut
close on eight tons in eight hours, and the cane
was said to be a good deal tangled, too. 1 have
met men who claimed to have cut and loaded 10
tons a day in burnt cane, but have never seen it
done. In any case they would not do it in eight
or even 12 hours.
“Sucre”: “Shiga” (B. 23/11/’22) says
dysentery is practically unknown in Australia. ’Spare
me blinkin’ days! In the summer of 1889, seven out
of a family of 11 were wiped out at Cunnamulla
(Q.) through it. There was no suggestion that that
was merely diarrhoea. I had an attack, and just
pipped the undertaker by a short head. Dysentery
is an offspring of bad drinking-water and worse
smells, and I got mine through filling up with
river water highly impregnated dead cow.
“O’North” in search of information: —
Does the Abo. Council know what precautions
should be taken when running cattle in priculy-uear
completely isolated from water ? . I have dry cattle
on pear that have not had a drink for two years
and are in a flourishing condition; but a few weens
ago I put in with them several well-conditioned
grass-fed cows and calves and the whole of the
new-comers have died. Perhaps the cows needed water
periodically, until they became inured to the pear.
On the other hand, I have known cows on pear
country to breed and rear calves which have reached
maturity without ever tasting water. However the
progeny have been largely stunted and unfit lot
breeding purposes. Herds existing, exclusively on
pear should be replaced every four years, as the diet
seems to undermine the constitution. During the
past nine months little heavy rain has fallen iii
B.W. Queensland, consequently in many parts cattle-

your constitution that has pulled you

bill in.”
owners have abandoned fairly well-grassed runs
barren of water and pear, and had recourse to
waterless pear belts. Hundreds of cattle have thus
perished through their owners’ ignorance of peat
properties. In a wet season pear contains 90 per
cent, by weight of water, but in a dry time this fall?
to 60 p.c. In the latter condition, when the pear
is most used, there is not sufficient moisture in it
to completely sustain cattle.
NATIVE ROSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of all the workers on our place,
There’s none like gentle Ilose.
The vigor of a noble race
Her graceful action shows;
A kindly light and spirit bright
Her ardent eyes disclose.
Of all the beauties anywhere,
There’s none like pretty Rose.
Untouched of paint, her face so fai
No chalk has bleached her nose;
Her lofty crest old nature drest,
But not with scarlet bows.
And flappers gay, around the place,
Must envy dainty Rose.
She has no use for pads or lace
Or parti-colored hose,
But stockings white, plain shoes —not light—
Low heels, and rounded toes.
And all the blokes about the plccs
Go nap on dinkum Rose;
With silken clobber borne with grace,
In bonzer style she goes.
A native born, the stalks of corn
Are shook on cobber Rose.
And critics from the other side
Admire our bonny Rose,
And though her race is Scotland’s pride,
No fairer flower grows
In Highland vales, or Lowland dales
Than our sweet native, Rose.
Though other beauties grace our land,
There’s none like stately Rose,
Her place is high, her pose is grand
Her fame no rival knows —
A Clydesdale mare with silky hair
Our champion—Native Rose.

The party designed to provide Christmas-
trees for the kiddies in the day nurseries
drew a crowd of women to the new room of
the Mary Elizabeth one afternoon last week.
Dame Margaret came on from invoking a
blessing on the Women’s Handicrafts Show,
and sat at a rose-banked table with Miss
Henderson, Mrs. McElhone, and Mrs.
Willie Drew. She wore cream heavily re-
inforced with guipure panels, and a flat hat
that was mostly a mauvey blue plume, which
looks as though it has been the king-pin in
some prize-bird’s tailorings. The Mayoress
—as she then was; she has since been sup-
planted by Mrs. Gilpin—wore georgette froek-
ing of larkspur hue and a hat that sprayed
feathers; and Mrs. Aronson, who lent her
pretty room and gave the tea to help the Cause,
more or less hid her light under a black hat
with a pink cabbage-rose blooming on its
brim. Pretty Kathlyn Hilliard, in a grey
costume and a cherry-colored crinoline "hat,
sat with the Dra.vson child, and later on
sang about “Dream-a-day Jill,” a farmer’s
lass who apparently combined the go-slow
policy with dreams of a dashing lover and
the church-over-the-hill. Other outstanding
musical honors were accorded by show of
hands to a young tenor who sang “The Blind
Ploughman” almost as artistically as the
departed Althouse. Mrs. Willie Drew and Dul-
cie Fry, who had carried the heat and burden
of the day, sat back and called their work
blessed; and Mrs. Neville Dangar and her
sister, Miss Weston, hawked flowers for the
Cause.
Gwendolyn Spanswick unleashed a light-
weight soprano at the Conservatorium the
other night in farewell to Australia. Her
long suit is temperament and artistic feel-
ing; and the audience took to her as natu-
rally as a bee to a bed of clover. Cyril Monk
fiddled, and under Henry Penn’s hands the
piano was as docile as a hypnotised tigress.
Her teacher here was Signor di Giorgio, and
she is to study further in England and Italy.
Mrs. Dale, who is back in Sydney, did not
place any of her plays, owing to the theatri-
cal slump in London, but she was elected
Australia’s woman delegate at the League of
Nations’ Conference in Geneva, where she
plucked a flowery word of congratulation
from Lord Balfour on the speech she made.
Perth has already accorded her a civic re-
ception, and there is talk of Sydney’s Town
Hall bursting into a shivoo of the same sort
in her honor.
Last week the Apollos struck their bloom-
lyre for the last time until cool nights
come again at the Conservatorium. Under
Alfred Hill’s lead they poured out three
powerful and dashing first-time perform-
ances: Coleridge Taylor’s “Viking Song,”
Laurant de liille’s “Hungarian March,” and
Max Bruch’s “Song of the Pirates.” Cacialli
and Lurline Hammond were soloists, and
l.ionel Lawson the fiddler of the evening.
Tony, the second son of Mick Meagher,
of Bathurst, has got engaged to Jean, the
very pretty daughter of Dr. Hugh and Mrs.
Busby. The Busbys have been old identi-
ties in the West since the year one, and the
Meaghers are very well known in business
and on the land.. Mick Meagher is the head
of this big family now that old John, the
M.L.C., is dead, and inhabits Kilrush House
in Bathurst, a fine old place containing one
of the best private libraries in the State.
The engaging cheeriness of the late Alek
bass was largely a mask. Inwardly he took
himself very seriously, not to say moodily ;
and with reason. He was a born aesthete, com-
pelled, by Fate and the requirements of the
flesh to early tread the profligate ways of
design, and later to wear the motley of a
comic-paper artist. Whether in the paint-
ing of a fowl-house or the furnishing of a
drawing-room, Sass would, by some indi-
vidual touch, reveal a most vital sense of the
decorative in form and color. Incidentally, for
one who in his private life abhorred the im-
perfect in form and color, his own short
physique and unheroic features constituted
a deep and secretly-nursed grudge which he
cherished against Nature. Yet, though a
classic example of the true artist and ego-
tist, Sass was one of the most genial hosts
imaginable.
It’s not much use an Australian writing
plays for production in his own country.
Take, for instance. D. H. Souter’s one-
acter, “The Good Losers,” produced by the
Repertory Society last week. In a poignant
scene Marie, the heroine, condemned to a
T.B, sanatorium, breaks away from her
lover, to whom her very kisses have now
become a menace, and to make the break-
away plausible invents a new lover. The
young man takes the blow standing up, say-
ing that if he is a good winner, surely he
can be a good loser. Marie replies: “That’s
fine, Billie,” and forthwith pours out two
glasses of wine, saying, “I got this to
celebrate something that didn’t come off, but
we’ll use it to drink your toast: ‘The Good
Losers!’ ” Next morning, the daily press,
in giving a resumd of the play, announced:
“Filling two glasses with poison, Marie in-
vites him to pledge her in drink.” And it
was good Australian wine, too!
The Loreto Convent old girls gave a great
floor-warming in the Milsons’ old home, the
school’s newly-acquired property, at Kirri-
billi, the other night. The rooms were rather
small for dancing, but the grounds were
wide for sitting out. Dr. and Mrs Yeech
chaperoned the flutter, which was further
manned to success by Eileen Ryan and
Valerie Courtney.
As the Boy Scouts are about to go to
Melbourne fa thousand-odd of them) for
their second annual corroboree, the Ist
Petersham Troop raked in some funds at a
bazaar. The affair was officially opened bv
Sydney’s Mayoress MoElhone, in the Scouts’
new clubroom in New Canterbury-road,
Petersham—the building which was given to
the boys bv Miss Charles Fairfax before she
left for Blighty.
Annette Barton, of Hunter’s Hill, is en-
gaged. She was visiting her sister, Mrs.
Roberts, of Colombo, when she met the only
man in the world. He comes from Eng-
land and his name is Williams. Annette’s
half-sister, Mrs. Hewson, is a widely known
and popular Queen’s Clubber.
The W. P. Dunlops got away in the Mol-
davia on Saturday, after a long series of
farewell parties. On Saturday morning,
before their boat sailed, they gave a fare-
well breakfast at the Australia.
The Wentworth is staging a whole week of
festivities, starting on Friday, December 22,
when the Christmas Eve party will be held
so that dancing may last into the small
hours; and the final sprint will be put into
the New Year’s jazz on the 29th for the
same reason. On the Saturday afternoon
a kiddies’ party will be given, at which
Christmas-trees and Punch-and-Judies will
flourish.
Muriel Buchanan and Marjory Balch
staged an evening of music at the Watson’s
Bay Town Hall one night last week. Mar-
jory is a clever pianist—one of Myrtle
Meggy’s most promising pupils—and Muriel,
who was a pupil of Jenny Cullen and a mem-
ber of the State Orchestra for six years,
has the distinction of being the first and
only violinist to gain the AGolin Teachers’
Diploma at the Conservatorium.
This L s . a Ma y Moore portrait of Mrs.
M. G. Skipper, whose husband is “Feng-
Shui” of many bril-
liant Bulletin
articles. She has
been through India
and Japan, and a
long way into China,
with her husband,
but the family is at
present domiciled in
Maoriland, while she
is on a visit to her
father, Henry Wil-
shire, architect, of
Sydney. She helps
her husband with his
black-and-white work
(he is an artist as
well as a writer),
and spends the rest
of her time teaching
the ways of the
world to two daughters and a small son.
St. Stephen’s hung out its white favors on
Monday evening to mark the marriage of
Mary Brodie, of the North Shore line and
until lately of Quirindi, and Eric Johnson,
of the Pacific Cable Board. Mary kept the
matrimonial tryst, sustained by a Limerick
lace frock, a tulle veil, an armful of gar-
denias and three bridesmaids—-Muriel
Brodie, Phyllis Pike and Muriel Johnson.
Their frocking was rainbow-tinted, further
cheered by sheafs of golden brown gladioli.
The work of Petrus Van der Velden. the
Dutch artist, who for 15 years made Maori-
land his home, is being shown for the first
time in Sydney. That the exhibition takes
place nine years after the painter’s death is
a pity; but in 189 S, when Petrus first looked
in on Australia, with his home-land honors
fresh upon him, there wasn’t the market for
paintings there is to-day. The artist lived
for many years in Christchurch (M.L.), and
it is on record that the Canterbury College
authorities rejected the old man’s proposal
to take charge of the life class for £5OO a
year. However, he left the hall-mark of his
tuition on a small group of Maoriland stu-
dents, one of whom, Mrs, Sherwood, is now
among Sydney’s foremost women painters.
Van der Velden’s son, to whom the 17 can-
vases in the present show belong, trades in
Sydney as a commission agent.
Critics abroad are a lot more appreciative
of Australian literary genius than most
or our home-made
ones. The pretty
girl in the picture is
Lola Gornall, o f
Sydney, and this is
what Frank Harris
wrote of her in a re-
view of her poems
in Pearson’s Maga-
zine the other day:
She has.... not only
technical accomplish-
ment, and the true
singing faculty, but that
passionate interest in
life and beauty and
greatness of soul which
distinguish the true art-
ist....! have put one
verse in italics, because
when I read it I ex-
claimed that nothing
more beautiful has been
done since Herrick. Un-
less I am greatly mistaken, Lola Gornall is on her
way to a high place in English literature. Already I
think, from these poems and from “The Cup,” that
she will have her seat somewhere between Emily
Bronte and Christine Rossetti.
Frank Harris, sometime, editor of (the
Saturday Review and the Fortnightly,
and one of the most eminent commentators
of the day on Shakspeare, is no lenient
critic. But his views are no different from
those of other well-known men. Middleton
Murry remarked, a couple of months ago,
that there was no group of half-a-dozen
singers in any country to-day of the quality
of David McKee Wright, Hugh McCrae,
Roderic Quinn, Zora Cross, M. Forrest and
Lola Gornall.
This (Thursday) afternoon, at half-past
o, Hugh Dixson will well and truly lay
the foundation stone of the first “Cancer
Home in New South Wales. It is to be a
wing of the Ryde Home for Incurables, and
will be known as the “Sir Hugh and Dame
Dixson Memorial.” The little knight of the
Quaker-like collars has handed over a
princely sum to help the building fund.
The late Arthur Pearson, who founded the
ht - Hunstan’s Hospital for Blinded Sailors
and Soldiers, hit upon a novel way of get-
ting cash for the good work. He came to
an arrangement with a tobacco firm to manu-
facture a new brand of cigarettes, to be
called St. Dunstan’s,” a considerable portion
°f tn e profits from the sales going direct to
the hospital—through which, by the way,
many Diggers have benefited. All tobac-
conists stock them, and three blind but merrv
soldiers make the trade-mark.
The Andre Skalski testimonial is at last
afloat, and a big committee is being formed
to decide on the exact manner in which the
money shall be raised that will reimburse
tne slim young Pole for his services to music
m Sydney. The preliminary meeting was
held in Paling’s concert hall last Monday.
Rumor says that matrons in Court circles
aie beginning to smile knowingly when
i rincess Mary Lascelles is mentioned. The
1 rincess has retired from active social life.
\ anous domestic additions are being hurried
up at Goldsborough Hall, and Queen Mary
has arranged to stay there during the second
week in January. It looks awfully interest-
ing—doesn’t it?
Sir Thomas Grattan Esmonde, Bart., who
has been nominated as one of the Senators
tor Southern Ireland, is no stranger to Aus-
tralia. With two other delegates he was
here close on 40 years ago on a
money-hunting expedition for the Home
Rule cause. He was a fine-looking young
reflow then, and caused some heart-flutter-
lngs when he visited the homes of well-to-do
exiles of Erin. It was, of course, his son,
the Sinn Feiner, whom the Hughes Govern-
ment were humorless enough to keep on
board ship in Sydney Harbor a few years
ago. The young man—tall, slim, mon'ocled
and faultlessly dressed—spent several pro-
fitless weeks leaning over the side of the
vessel in mid-stream before he was shipped
back to Erin via the U.S.
Renee Maxwell, who left the Firm a
month or so ago to concentrate on her
studies, goes off to America next year
D Alvarez made a great friend of the Syd-
ney girl when she was in Australia, and
has promised her inside introductions in the
U.S.A. Renee confesses to a modest ambi-
tion to conquer the Opera House in Buenos
Aires.
The Lawrence Grossmith couple have
been more out of than in their flat in the
new Hampton Court building of late no
really fashionable party being quite com-
P ,t e without them. Mrs. Lawrence’s
golden hair and drawling voice give no hint
of her wide knowledge of letters. Of course
he to the flapper person will always possess
the fascinating possibilities of becoming an
Applejohn at any moment. The MacCor-
micks and the Alec Gordons are among their
warmest admirers.
The D,mlop couple, who passed through
feydney last week ard were entertained furi-
ously in official circles, have been British
Consullmg iu Noumea for several years.
He now goes on to take up the job of
Assistant-inspector of Consulates, with
headquarters in London. The pair were
gracious enough to sw" thev’d rather live in
Sydney than any of the other spots in the
world they have known. Thev went off by
the Moldavia, the boat that carried also the
Willie DunloDS, of Sydney.
The ’Varsity has honored itself by the
appointment of two Australian-borns to pro-
fessorships—John Irvine Hunter (Anatomy)
and Launcelot Harrison (Zoology). Hunter
was born in Victoria, is only 24, and gathered
his education at Fort-street (Sydney) High
School and the Uni. He graduated
M. 8., Ch.M. in 1920, and has been Associate-
Professor of Anatomy since Jan., 1921. At
present he is touring the U.S. Harrison
is a native of Wellington (N.S.W.), and one
of the many brilliant scholars who wore the
colors of King’s School, Parramatta, in sport
and study. He got a B.Sc. with first-class
honors in 1913, and a B.A. (Research) at
Cambridge in 1916. During the war Harri-
son was advisory entomologist of the Ex-
peditionary Force in Mesopotamia.
Royal Art Society students held their
once-a-year frivol the other night. It was in
the form of a Back-to-Ividdy-Day movement.
The girl students came in the check rompers,
pinafores and big sashes of early childhood,
and budding Lamberts and Lindsays arrived
in shorts, sailor jumpers and Peter Pan
hats. A few of this year’s master-
pieces in oil were caricatured, whilst one
of Sydney’s artistic social lions was etfigied
in a manner that can only be termed
dastardly, such indifference did it be-
tray to the feelings of the genius.
Dattilo Rubbo shepherded the flock, and
later turned himself into Santa Claus.
Amongst those present was Francis
Mahony, offspring of that Frank who had
a genius for putting gee-gees on to Bristol-
board in the early days of The Bulletin.
A few days ago an animated group was
gathered in front of one of Farmer’s Pitt-
street windows, from which three ladies, evi-
dently born in the purple, gazed with hauteur
on the passers-by. Their cheeks were rose-
tinted, if waxlike, and their gaze decidedly
fixed, but their raiment was gorgeous. Three
lanna “boys,” accompanied by a “white
feller,” joined the crowd. The nigs were
clad very much d la Chidley, and their mass
of lime-bleached hair towered on high. Their
eyes bulged, as, with arms extended, they
cried chorus, what sounded like “Karikol
kas! Karikol kas !” The guide interpreted
this as “Most beautiful idols!” whereupon
there were shrieks of laughter: “Don’t
laugh so loudly,” remarked Milne Curran,
the scientist, who was standing by, “only
an hour ago I passed this very spot and I
saw five civilised white ladies worshipping.”
A Brisbane postscript:—
Our Ex. firmly believes in advising the Young
Idea how to shoot, and he did a little of it at the
Brisbane High School break-up, and again at the
Clayfield College speech-day.
Jessie Woodroffe, daughter of Fred of that ilk
and a Kangaroo Pointer, is showing creditable hand-
made pottery in the Sheldon Gallery. Mamma paints
some in water-color, and Jessica has a taste in deep
colorings which should command ducats. Governor
Nathan blew ipto the show during the week and
beamed approval.
Bellevue station captures his Ex. for Christmas,
when Mrs. Lumley Hill will kill the fatted calf and
show the famous mounted hoofs of dead racing sires.
She dined his Ex. and Mary of Hamilton at Len-
non’s on the sth.
On the 6th his Ex. went to All Hallows concert
m His Majesty’s Theatre. The Premier and Mrs.
Theodore sat with him, also Fathers Lane, Potter
and O’Keefe, with Captain Hammond as rear-guard.
As usual, the theatre was crowded.
His Ex. also joined in the braw Scotch nicht in
the Majestic, which commenced with the lament by
Pipe-Major Mackenzie for Robert Philp, P. J. McDer-
mott and others who will return to Lochaber no
more ; but the evening ended gaily enough with an
ovation to Theodore and a musical programme.
McGregor was welcomed by the clans, though P.B.
from Merthyr was absent through illness, and J.
Walker, who wears a back-to-front collar, went strong
in his stead.
In the afternoon the vice-regals motored to Ascot,
Hamilton’s Duchess being in the party, and his Ex.
tea-ed a number of racegoers, including the Arnold
Weinholts, generals, captains and sundry bonme
lasses. Later in the night the busy Sir Matt, ap-
peared at the Austral Choir’s concert, where Mary
of Hamilton and the Tully and Cannans awaited him.
Lena Hammond, in amber, and Lottie Richeter, in
blue, were soloists in “The Messiah,” and the appre-
ciation received by them was highly floral.
Organist Sampson’s wife gave a big afternoon
among white-and-blue lilies, snapdragons and daisies
in the lounge at Montpelier, where Society gathered
in its prettiest frocks, and drank tea and discussed
the nice things the Governor said to George Samp-
son on the evening of the last organ recital of the
season.
The Pitt Riverses are breathing the scent of gum-
trees at Coochin, with Captain and Miss Harboard
helping.
Mrs. Harvey Johnston’s imminent departure is
being regretfully stressed by functions, the latest
being at the Women’s Club, whereat Freda Bage
presided. Asters, laden with many kind thoughts,
were handed to the lady, and all the guests were of
the feminine gender.

Lady Stradbroke is turning into a fine
publicity agent for “The Sentimental Bloke.”
She went along early in the season, and was
so delighted that she dragged her Earl along
the same week to see the show. She was
particularly interested in the Bloke himself,
and, after her second visit, declared she
wanted to “book again next week.”
Alderman Cabena’s popular little wife was
responsible for a cheery afternoon party in
the St. Neot’s reception parlors the other
day. She met her guests becomingly maro-
cained in black under lace panellings, with
girdle of jet and a trim black hat sprouting
pink azaleas. Beatrice Tiernan and Vera
Carew provided pleasurable turns between
talks. Mrs. Ilewison, just back from a short
exploration of the Solomons, helped her
aunt-in-law do the hostessing, and inciden-
tally raised the enw of all the other women
with a blaok-and-red hat of alluring quality,
which she is suspected of having discovered
on her way back through N. S. Wales. Mrs.
Robb, wife of the Canadian Minister of
Trade, moved round in white jersey silk in-
scribed with black under a beplumed hat.
Another overseas visitor, Mrs. Knapp, was
in black, which appeared to have been nailed
to her person with scarlet tacks. The medi-
cal Barrett dame was there, tall Ivy Deakin
Brookes, the Henry Weedon widow, Mrs.
Harry Emmerton and her sister, the James
Murphy widow, Mrs. Geoff. Syme, Mrs. *W.
Robins, Mrs. H. A. Austin, and so on. Aider-
man Cabena drifted in mid-way through the
proceedings, and appeared to enjoy things
immensely.
Guido, the youngest of the Wertlieim sons,
is playing a new role at the moment. He
has taken on the job of “Cook’s touring”
a party of English folk who have come along
to have a look at Maoriland. Guido could
set up a law office at any moment, but he
rather likes the idea of living up to one
of Locke’s characters. It’s bringing lots
of shekels to his not too weighty purse, as
well.
A group of hostesses, with Mrs. George
as lion, sec., spread a cheery evening party
in the Lyceum Club on Friday to welcome
Maisie Maxwell, who is just back from Lon-
don’s Inky Way. Maisie dimpled more
alluringly than ever in silky-blue hangings
which screamed Paris from every seam. The
chatter was brightened with musical turns
by George Brooke and his pianist pal
Cahill, and some elocution from Charlotte
Hemming; and everyone enjoyed themselves
mightily and said it was a perfectly lovely
frivol.
The Albert Con. has bagged Hilda Roberts
for its staff. She is a recent arrival from
England, is a pupil of the Tobias Matthay
School, and started off by offering a scholar-
ship entitling the winner to two years’ free
tuition.
The Broadmeadows Babies were made the
excuse for a jolly 'old supper da-nce at the
Hotel Windsor the other night. The dining-
room was turned into a ballroom, and the ex-
tensive lounge of the remodelled hotel was
crowded. Mrs. Robins, Mrs. Marriot and Mrs.
Merson Cooper, who ran the 'show, were
chuckling at their luck in getting so many of
the Very Best at a time when the season is
usually at its bedraggled end. Supper was
spread at many little tables well out of
range of the jazzers. There is one great
and overwhelming point of vantage for a
dance at the Windsor —the vast acreage of
its reception-rooms. The place is a coup-
ling of the old White Hart and the Grand,
whose, insides have been magically re-set and
re-decorated. The management threw open
the whole of the ground floor for the use of
the Broadmeadows appeal committee, and
helped generously in every direction. The
Foundling Home of the Little Sisters of
St. Joseph is making a strong bid for prac-
tical sympathy.
Sir Tom Bridges, the new Governor of S.
Aus. has the quite unusual distinction of
being a ballad-hero while he still lives. In
the retreat from Mons he came across a
British company near Le Cateau, flat-out
from fatigue, and unable to raise a march
even to avoid the capture which was immi-
nent. Knowing the persuasive power of a
band in the circumstances, Bridges hastily
bought in a village shop a toy whistle and
drum, found someone who could play the
one, and himself, banging the other, led the
weary men down the road to comparative
safety. The incident took the fancy of no
less a writer than Newbolt, who slap-dashed
off wlmt used to be called a “Dagonet ballad”
about it. And now the amateur reciters with
whom Adelaide abounds will spend the next
year or two —unless officially barred, as is
not unlikely—in assuring the world that
As long as there’s an Englishman to ask a tale of
me,
As long as I can tell the tale aright,
We’ll not forget the penny whistle’s wheedle-deedle-
dee,
And the big Dragoon a-beating down the night.
Methody circles were ruffled by the
Thomas divorce suit, which ended in favor
of the fair respondent and her alleged inti-
mate last week. Mrs. Thomas was formerly
Nurse Ethel Tregear, and is a member of
an exceptionally holy clan, which has dedi-
cated two of its, brightest to the service of
the Lord. The pair of parsons, who are her
uncles, jointly married her to Charles
Thomas a few years back, and the family
turned out in its very best to see the knot
firmly tied. But the lady was 11 years senior
to her hubby, and a temperamental gap
added to the pile of discrepancies. Eventually
they separated, and she lived quietly at Park-
ville, until her acquaintance with Charles
Hawthorne Lydall—begun apparently by
the casual intervention of her infant in
a fashionable tea-room —hurled her suddenly
into publicity. Her hubby, who had been
quietly watching her movements, could only
sheet home to her the discreet indiscretion of
kissing Lydall one night in the street,'so Judge
Macfarlan gave her the benefit of the doubt.
At the same time S’Llonor could not refrain
from calling the co-re. a “humbug,” pre-
sumably because he solemnly maintained
that he had visited Mrs. Thomas merely to
discuss the Einstein theory, Transcendental-
ism and other topics of similarly serious im-
port.
The Frank Bretts’ chick, who married
Humphrey Clegg, is off to Sorrento for three
blissful months, having bagged Warraweena,
a charming seaside bungalow. Girl pals
are getting their trickiest diving kit ready,
to see which batch can get the highest color
shriek during the planned house parties.
Chromes and scarlets and jade greens are
“in” for bathing-gowns, caps and capes. The
latest yell is to have a huge bag of parrot-
patterned cretonne, ostensibly for towels, but
really to cope with the make-up box. A
parasol to match the parrot pattern, and a
whole outfit in one of the primary colors gets
a good Streeton background in the summer-
blue sea. The newest bathing-caps are
dinky things—like aviators’ helmets. They
buckle under the chin in an adorable way if
there is a. dimple flying round. In the
meantime Mrs. Clegg and her pal, Mrs. Clive
Fairbairn (the Edmund Jowett daughter),
are joining forces in swaggah tea-parties in
town—some of the last that Societv will
indulge in before it goes down to the sea-and-
sunburn of the real dog-days.
This is how Buskin’s camera saw the
talented Mrs. E. Kathleen Venman, whose
latest song, “Down Dorset —a musical
setting to some
verses found on the
body of a dead sol-
dier —will shortly
be launched here
and in England by
Allan’s. She was a
Geelong girl, Elsie
Pasker, and before
changing her name
and abode was a
very live wire in
musical and amateur
theatrical circles'. She
helped to produce
several comic
operas, including
“lolanthe,” in which
she looked after the
ballet, and further
starred in comedy
parts. Since coming
to Melbourne she has appeared in several
roles with Gregan McMahon’s Repertory
Company, and more lately with the Mermaid
Players. She will be best remembered as
the unaffected, unbelieving landlady in
“Columbine” and as Gladys Smith’s vulgar
mother in “Secondary Considerations.” At
present Mrs. Venman is keener on the
musical side of things, and besides writing
songs is running an instrumental trio with
the laudable aim of popularising the work of
good composers.
The Hector Wilson widow sends the dire-
ful news that she is the poorer by two
diamond necklaces with a £20,000 sparkle,
which were snatched from her side in a
Continental train. She had confidingly laid
the bag containing the costly baubles on the
seat beside her, and half-way through the
journey a superior-looking fellow-passenger
left the train with the diamonds, covering
the theft with a fire of apologies for brush-
ing against the owner as he streaked for
the platform. Then it was that Admiral
Bouchard, who was convoying his mother-
in-law to Genoa, was awakened from a cosy
snooze by the bitter wail, “Mv diamonds !
Oh, my diamonds!” The Admiral was the
Commodore of the French squadron which
spent some months in these waters about 14
years back. His attractive Franco-Austra-
lian wife, who joined him here to help him
dispense lavish hospitality on the flagship
Catinat. passed out suddenly during the war.
Mrs. Wilson’s son by her first marriage,
Pierre Bellew, is a resident of Melbourne,
where his elder hope; Jack, has just started
newspaper work with the Akgus.
At a time when most people are shying
at housekeeping, the Jack Sternbergs, who
have made Scott’s and other hotels their
home for donkey’s years, have sud-
denly dived into really and truly domes-
tic life. One is both missus and cook,
and the other master and butler. They
are making several of their fashionable
friends pause to wonder why they are racing
crazily after the always-elusive Mary Ann.
In time, doing one’s own housework will
become a cult, not a grouch. And then the
haughty slavey will be brought to a proper
humility.
Here is Mrs. Lister, who captured the
Victorian quota of feminine champion com-
petitors at the re-
cent lawn tennis
inter-State contests,
when she scored a
victory in the mixed
doubles with Pat
O’Hara Wood, and
was runner-up in the
ladies’ singles, won
by Miss Boyd. The
latter partnered her
in the women’s
doubles, in which
they went down be-
fore the Mother-
State pair. A s
Meryl Wax man, a
Toorak College girl,
this popular young
matron won her
earliest tennis -vic-
tory by defeating the
vice-regal Denman lady in single combat at
the annual inter-State tourney. Mrs. Lister
is the widow of the late medical captain,
Roy luster, who sailed for Anzac directly
after his honeymoon, and passed out shortly
after his return to Australia. Rembrandt is
responsible for the picture.
Mrs. Moonee Valley Hiskens, who lately
stepped up to the presidential chair of the
Women’s Hospital Committee, beckoned the
Lady Mayoress and all the lesser mayoresses
to tea at the hospital the other day, so that
they might shudder at the awfulness of the
musty mid-Victorian buildings as compared
with the modern Georgian wards. The civic
ladies duly came, and as duly shuddered at
the grimy discomforts of ancient splendor,
then bubbled enthusiastically over the
luxurious equipment of the new wings. Be-
fore the voyage of inspection the hostess,
aided by her fellow-committeeites, fed the
sightseers with tea and cakes, and Madame
Ashley, Mrs. D. Barrie and Miss Fitzpat-
rick, from Ballarat, brought other solace
to their souls with song. The hospital mat-
ron, a plump and pleasing personality, blew
in to say that anyone responding to the
appeal to help the linen stores can exercise
their own discretion as regards size, but
admitted that the hospital likes the towels
big, and the sheet should be bounded on
one side by 72 inches, and on the other by
2f yards.
The Lyceum Club is threatening to move
into new quarters further up the street,
and great and furious are the discussions of
the pros and cons. This highbrow centre
provides much speculation for the mere on-
looker. It decided in the long ago that to
be a member it was necessary for the can-
didate to have a profession or a professional
husband, and as time has gone on “black-
balling” seems to have become a favorite
pastime of many of the members. High-
brows do not yet seem to have learned the
art of throwing pettiness from their sys-
tems—that is, if this club is a fair sample.
Word from London tells that Lord Darn-
ley, one of the war-poor peers, has had to
quit his stately family home at Cobham, Kent,
and retire to a modest villa close by. He was
that Hon. Ivo Bligh who captained a team
of English cricketers in Australia in
the ’eighties. He simultaneously annexed
an Australian bride, Florence Morphy,
daughter of a Victorian police magistrate]
and a protegee of the Janet Clarke lady, who
loomed large in Melbourne Society' those
days.
Editor Schuler, of the Age, is looking
years younger since the arrival of his grand-
son, Robin. Dorothy Denholm adopted Syd-
ney as her home when she married, but she
has brought the blissful baby over for an ex-
tended visit to Melbourne.
Hans Irvine, formerly of the Great Western
Vineyard, Stawell, who was for a few years
in the Vic. Uppah Chambah and then in the
Reps., left £279,000 in this State to relatives
and friends. Treasurer McPherson will get
a tidy cut out of it to help balance his
ledger.
For the first time in 34 years the ink-
slingers had their coats off in the Assembly
gallery on Friday. Some of the scribes also
took off their vests. Permission had been
obtained from the Speaker, or, rather, it
had been arranged that the undressers should
not be officially “seen.” The heat was ter-
rific, and the ventilation in the House, a
temporary chamber in the wing of the Exhi-
bition Building, where dogs and poultry used
to be on show, was defective. Electric fans
made things a bit better for members on the
floor below.
Died recently in England, at 90, Col.
Edward Pearce, one-time commercial mag-
nate in Wellington (M.L.). In 1593 he
became senior partner of Levin and Co., Ltd.,
and did much, politically and otherwise, to
boost along the mercantile growth of the
Windy City. He held directorships in pretty
•well all the big companies, and was chairman
of the Harbor Board and the Chamber of
Commerce. Pearce w<l*s keen on “volunteer-
ing,” and bossed the M.L. Regiment of Artil-
lery.
The Town Hall was packed to the last
available inch for the Bjelke Petersen
annual show —a medley of physical culture,
rhythmic drill and folk dancing, with songs
by Muriel Cheek as a special extra. One
set of girls who spend their days behind
the counter of a big rag store looked like a
bevy of Greek goddesses as they swayed
with easy elasticity. From a spectacular
point of view the Scandinavian folk dances,
for which space had been roped off on the
hall floor, took first honors, but the whole
hall howled its appreciation of the jiu-jitsu
turns. Four hundred took an active part in
the display, and the whole lot were graceful
arguments to prove that the charm of the
Australian girl is not all in her face.
A meeting held at Melbourne Hospital
decided, with much enthusiasm, that Mrs.
Railway Clapp’s “Lucille of Bond-street”
would have a fresh outing to-morrow (Fri-
day) at Her Majesty’s; the gate, tea and
flower money, likewise the proceeds of the
auction grab, are to go to the Melbourne and
Alfred hospitals. Arthur Baillieu is the
hon. sec., and the amateurs have been having
another glorious whirl of house rehearsals.
Some gossip from Adelaide: —
Our new Exes, got a great welcome, which lasted
from the Port wharf to the city Town Hall. Sir
Tom Bridges is amazingly tall, and he looked most
imposing in his scarlet-and-gold, with as many decora-
tions as even his broad chest could comfortably
carry. She, slim and petite, was befurred, and
wore a cape-frock, sand-colored, and a smallish
black toque pulled well down over her eyes. They
plunged straightway into a hectic time, what with
a levee, the presentation of addresses, and what
not. The guests at their first dinner-party were
the Chief Justice and Miss Murray, the Barwells
and their daughter, General Chauvel, Mrs. D. Mur-
ray and R. G. Irving.
The shopping instinct soon called Lady Bridges
to Rundle-street, and on Wednesday she and her
young daughter, Alvilde, called at a bootshop to buy
a new pair of shoes for the girl. When the latter
was suited she asked, “May I keep them on ?” “Not
unless you pay for them,” said the assistant. Lady
Bridges intervened and said she was sorry she had
no money, but thought the firm might trust them.
The young lady remarked that she would have to
submit the name and address of the would-be pur-
chaser to the head of the firm, and when she was
told, “Lady Bridges, Government House,” she
gasped. But her Ex. smilingly commended her for
her business-like methods.
The Children’s Hospital fete was a. huge success,
and should turn in a record cheque. Amongst the
stallholders were the Brookman dame and Mrs.
Charles Angas, the Allan Campbell clan, Mrs. T. E.
Barr Smith, Mrs. Cudmore, the James Marshalls,
the Moulden dame, Mrs. H. C. Cave, the Duncans
and Downers, Mrs. Chapman, the Goode dame and
Mrs. A. E. Davey. The Queen’s Home, by a stroke
of bad luck, had a ffite on the same day; but its
supporters rallied to it nobly, and the proceeds will
bring the Home a good many of the extra comforts
it was asking for.
The Community Singers have totted up their
balance-sheet for the year, and find that they’ve taken
close on £6OO at their collections. Both the
Helene Taylor and Rita Coonan funds have to thank
the Singers for cheques.
The Adelaide Oval and Lawn Tennis Club has
had its final meeting for the year—the usual tea and
talk and prize-giving at the hands of Miss Murray,
amid masses of flowers from Mrs. Backhouse’s gar-
den at Mount Lofty.
The Conservatorium’s final students’ concert and
presentation of diplomas filled the Elder Hall to
bursting point, and there was another big crowd at
Oscar Taeuber’s students’ concert a couple of nights
later. At the latter, pride of place was given Reka
Grasby, the possessor of a dramatic soprano that
won Melba’s approval, who is bound for Europe for
further training.
St. Peter’s College blossomed into two parties
last week, with the Head as host and his father
and mother (Canon and Mrs. Bickersteth) as the
guests of the afternoon. It was an outside affair,
with tea in a marquee and under shady trees. The
visitors go to Tasmania with their son for the
summer vacation, and will spend another month or
so here before turning towards England.
Incidentally, St. Peter’s Rowing Club has a new
racing eight, presented by Tom Barr Smith and duly
christened “Mary Isobel” by his wife.

Horses with important engagements at the
Christmas and New Year meetings were conspicuous at
Rosehill (N.S.W.) on Saturday. Duke Isinglass won
the first division of the six-furlong Flying Handicap,
beating Glenacre comfortably; and Pagan Chief led
all the way in the second division, the M.L. mare
Radiant Light and Erasmus chasing him home. All
five are in the Villiers and Carrington at handy
weights. Another winner that led from start to
finish was Lady Aura, in the first section of the
seven-furlong Three-year-old Handicap. The blood
of Carbine and Auraria runs in the veins of this
beautiful filly, who hasn’t done much racing since
she landed the Gimcrack Stakes last year. Not
entered for the Yilliers, she has Bst. 31b. in the
Carrington Stakes, but possibly her party has some-
thing richer in sight. Dighton, who won the second
division, is a useful and improving colt. The 10-
furlong December Handicap gave Cymric his third
successive victory. Swift Shot was favorite," but
made an inglorious show, whereas the imported
horse was always up with the leaders and came
home at his leisure two lengths ahead of David, who
carried the steadier of 9st. 131 b. All going well,
Cymric will start at a murderous price in the
Summer Cup. Only two favorites won, but most
of the other winners were well backed.
* * *
“F.A.”: The summer meeting of the Gun-
bar (N.S.W.) Race Club, just. ,20 years ago, was, in
the light of more recent events, an interesting affair.
The straight of the (i-furlong course was that part of
the Hay-Hillston road which ran past Tom Murphy’s
pub. Tom was judge; Bill Ariffstrong, manager of
the Gunbar, was chairman ; and the manager of' Cowl
Cowl did the starting by flag. The vast attendance
(about 250) was accounted for by. the fact that the
big drought had broken three weeks before. There
were two V.C.’s present: Albert Jacka, aged 10,
and Billy Jackson, aged 8. The night before the
races a woman drove up to the pub in a sulky.
She had her nephew Frankie beside her, and was
followed at halter’s length by a big black horse,
which showed more daylight under him than the
Pyrmont Bridge at low water. Banjo was his name,
and around Booligal he was known to be slick over
six furlongs. His
d:iit was the Handi-
cap, one sov. each,
with 30 added. They
Save him 9st. 121 b.
Frankie was to ride
him. but he sealed
onlv sst. and had
difficulty in making
the weight. Eventu-
ally a heavy stock
saddle was stuck
on 14 cor macks and
the available lead, and
Frankie proudly rode
to the post. At the
home turn. Banjo led
his field by about four
lengths. Half-way
down the straight, in
fact, opposite the pub,
the saddle shifted, and
the bags started to
slip. The kid jockey
applied the whip vig-
orously with one hand,
and gathered in the
sliding bags with the
other. He won by
seven lengths • with
four bags in hand.
That was Frank Bul-
lock’s first ride in
public.
“Jumbo” WELLS,

“The Deacon”: Dead at Penrith (N.S.W.),
Tom Donoghue, old-time jockey and trainer. 1* ifty-
odd years ago, being then a 4st. 111 b. boy, Tom
steered Italian to victory in the Home Rule Handi-
cap at Home Rule, beating among, others the Mel-
bourne Cup winner, Warrior, then owned by Bob
Sievier, old Eclipse and other noted nags. This victory
put him on the map, and for years he was a suc-
cessful horseman —he once: rode 22 winners in nine
months —until an accident caused him to get his
name placed on the trainers’ list. In his time he
trained for Lees, Rouse, Thompson of Widden, and
Hunter White.

“T.O.I”: I met the late J. J. Miller (B.
7/12/’22) in the mid-’sixties, when he compiled a
book in a hairdressing saloon in Gertrude-street,
Fitzroy. Deplorably despondent, he held his head
in his hands while the conversation ran on the Cup
race, run on the previous day. “I have lost all my
money,” he groaned. But he soon recovered. For a
time he kept the old theatrical house, the Garrick’s
Head Hotel, in Bourke-street, opposite the old
Eastern Markets. Another licensee was William Pitt,
the scenic artist.

Representative tennis begins to rival inter-
state cricket as a gate-money attraction. In spite
of capricious weather the all-Australia tourney on
Sydney’s new White City courts resulted in a profit
of £iooo. The crowd on the last day, when Ander-
son (N.S.W.) met Patterson (Vic.) for continental
honors, exceeded 5000, and an irrepressible section
beefed out advice to or reprobation of the players.
To the utter disgust of veteran racquet-spinners the
barracker has come in with the boom. Patterson
arrived late, and it was announced that he had a
“dicky” wrist. But after being beaten pointless in
the first set he forgot all about the ailment, or rose
superior to the pain, and won the second and third,
6—3, 6 —3. The Cornstalk gathered in the fourth
and fifth. 6 —3, 6 —2, and in the exultation of win-
ning the championship bounded over the net and
grabbed his victim’s hand. Both men played vigor-
ous tennis, but each has risen to greater heights.
There was a rousing first set in the doubles, Ander-
son and Peach winning 10 games to the 8 scored
by Patterson and Hawkes. But after that the Vic-
torians got into their stride, and they never gave
the N.S.W. pair a chance in the second and
third sets, 6—o, 6—o; the fourth they took
at 7—5. The mixed doubles also went to
Victoria, through the agency of Hawkes and
Miss Boyd, who obliterated H. S. Utz and his
wife, 6 —l, 6—l. A popular win was that
of Mrs. Molesworth, the one Queenslander in
the championship class. Playing cool, resourceful
tennis, the smiling northern dame routed Esna
Boyd, the Victorian, 6 —3, 10 —8, and went through
the tourney without losing a set. Her backhand is
particularly good. However, Miss Boyd got some con-
solation in the doubles, in which she and Miss Mount-
tain (Vic.) defeated Miss St. George and Mrs. Utz
(N.S.W.) by 3 —6, 6— 4, 7—5. But for Anderson
N.S.W. would have fared badly.
* * «• *
“Arthenice”: Why is it, considering the
high average of the games in Australia, tnat our
women don’t play better tennis? With very few
exceptions, they give the impression of being
cramped in style and sluggish in thought and move-
ment ; a lady’s game, even of the best, is . usually
hopelessly dull to watch. This is not so in Eng-
land. Having recently seen the finest lady-players
over there, I have no hesitation in saying that we
have nobody in the same class as Miss McKane, Miss
Ryan and Mrs. Peacock, to say nothing of the re-
doubtable Suzanne. Yet English girls, on the whole,
play a weaker game than Australians, and the
Australian men have proved themselves superior to
the English champions. The Englishwoman’s back-
hand is greatly superior to ours, and she drives with
greater power. Mrs. Molesworth approaches most
nearly in style to the best English ladies; but I
doubt if she could cope with Miss McKane at her
best.
* * * *
“15-30” : Norman Peach, who beat the
lofty Weftheim in a record match of 90-odd games
at the White City (N.S.W.), must be one of the
greatest uphill fighters in the game. Wertheim had
scored two sets to love, and was within a point of
the third, and then Peach snatched the game out of
the fire. Just a few days previously he put up an
equally plucky match against Patterson in the Vic.-
N.S.W. tournament, Patterson winning easily in
the first set (6 —0), but dropping the next two
(7 —5 each time) owing to Norman’s tenacity. I
recall an even more memorable tussle, when Peach
walloped Norman Brookes. The old international
outplayed Peach in the first two sections, and people
were preparing to go home. But the younger
man started to play with deadly skill, and scoring
heavily with well-placed passes, won the next three
sets in very good style. It is a pity that in the
Sydney tournament Peach had not been “seeded” to
meet Patterson, instead of Anderson. Judging by his
Melbourne form, he would have made the big Vic-
torian go for his life. Likewise, it would have
helped the gate to put up Hawkes against
Anderson. The two have not yet met in a five-set
struggle, so far as I can remember, and Hawkes’s
showing against Patterson in Sydney suggests that
the youngster would have strung out Anderson to
five sets also.
* * * *
“Timson” : Up on the Victorian Dividing
Range, where I recently saw some hefty timber-
cutters hitting a ball backwards and forwards over
a net, there’s a punch on the jaw waiting for the
first reckless citizen who calls tennis a “Sissies’
game” in their hearing. I merely mention this fact
to inform “Wodgil” (B. 7/12/’22) that the pastime
that used to be degraded by curates’ parties in
trim English novels, is now testing the bone,
nerve and muscle of the strongest in the land. Tennis
is a game, calling for activity, stamina, quick think-
ing and the highest sportsmanship, and to condemn
it for the fact that it is played by “Johnnies and
Gerties” is about as sensible as ruling out boxing
and football because they are largely supported by
windv louts of all ages who would be much better
exercising their legs than their lungs. “Wodgil’s”
contention that “hundreds of able-bodied men_ and
women are drawn from toil for long periods” to
play tennis is equally ridiculous. It is certainly
true that a Davis Cup team of four may be away
from Australia for six months in the year, but the
great body of tennis-players who enter for cham-
pionships don’t take more than a week in the year,
and, barring the few leisured ones who can appear
at any time, the great majority have to get special
leave, which is deducted from their annual holidays.
I quite agree that the nation’s need is work, but to
make that contention the basis for a howl about
tennis, when the national and unique scandal of a
large and useless racing population demands more
vociferous complaint, suggests that “Wodgil” has no
sense of proportion.
* * * *
All the skinners who won the toss in Mel-
bourne on Saturday gave the other fellow the first
taste of the mostly rain-sodden wickets. The result
was short spasms of heavy plodding by the classiest
batsmen and an improvement in several bowling
averages. St. Kilda, reinforced by Ironmonger, who
gathered 6 for 47, dismissed Northcote for 100, and,
taking their turn on the drying turf, finished up
with 5 for 126. Armstrong, appearing for M.C.O.
against Prahran, knocked up top score, 36, but none of
the others showed any confidence against Grimmett,
who got 7 for 43. If J. Pluvius is in a more amiable
mood next Saturday, P’ran, with 0 for 14, ought to
wipe off the deficiency of 131. South Melbourne totalled
only 76 against North (Matthews, 7 for 39), and
North, closing down With 9 for 85 (Goodfeliow, 7
for 32), have captured three of South for 13 in the
second innings, though the victims belong to the
tail-end. Clem Sindrey (5 for 30) and Love (4 for
41) were Richmond’s heavy artillery in the demoli-
tion of Hawthorn East for 9 for 122 (declared
closed). The Yellow and Blacks feel hopeful with
70 to make and nine wickets to fall. The ’Roy-
’ Wood fixture offers opportunities for a gamble, with
the odds on ’Roy, They are 7 for 77, which is 25
behind ’Wood’s total, and Liddicutt, who outed 7
of the Magpies for 57, is 26 n.o. Another close
contest is being staged at the University Oval. Carl-
ton probably feel that they declared prematurely
with 8 for 95, seeing that the Students are 7 for 61,
and have at least two bats capable of pulling the
match out of the fire.
“Winkle”: The Sheffield Shield looks a
good thing for N. S. Wales. Victoria won it last
year, but they have lost McDonald and O’Keeffe.
Mac. promised to return from England in time for
the inter-State matches at Christmas, but he found,
on applying for a berth, that all available accommo-
dation on the boats had been taken, so he will not
return for another 12 months. As he has played
cricket all the year round since the beginning of the
1920 season, and is not a powerfully-built fellow,
this six months’ spell should be of great benefit to
him. In McDonald’s absence Wallace, of Prahran,
will be responsible for the fast stuff. Though every
ball he bowls has to be played, the match against
McLaren’s XI proved that he is not physically
capable of bearing the brunt of an attack on suc-
cessive days without losing his “devil.” Unless
Hartkopf again meets with sensational success —
which isn’t likely, as all the N. S. Welshmen use
their feet well —Victoria will do plenty of scouting
this season.
• * * *
“Azrim”: Triple blue and versatile ath-
lete though he is, Dr. A. E. V. Hartkopf is not the
greatest all-rounder produced by Vic. public schools.
That honor is conceded to Frank Boynton, of Wesley
College, the only quadruple blue of Melb. Uni., who
won fame at cricket, football, rowing and rifle-
shooting. In addition Boynton was a capital weight-
putter, a sound tennis- and billiard-player, and an
excellent boxer. But if “Winkle” (B. 30/11/’22) is
still unsatisfied let him look up the public-school
records and see the athletic careers of S. B. Graven-
all, J. D. Newham and J. A. Prout, all of whom
hailed from Wesley College.
* * * *
“J.H. (London): R. H. Bettington, who
has just been elected captain of the Oxford cricket
XI for next year, is the first Australian to skipper
a ’Varsity since S. M. J. Woods’s day. “Betters,”
as he is known at Oxford, has a charming person-
ality. and possesses troops of friends, not only at
the ’Varsity, but also in the rarer and more classic
circles of the M.C.C. He has played for the Gentle-
men of England, and is also, of course, a Rugger
blue. His father used to play cricket and rugger
at Guy’s Hospital, where “Betters” is to go when
his ’Varsity days are over.
■» * • *
Though the wickets were mostly slow and
the bowling was rather better than usual, at least
two big scores were compiled in Sydney on Saturday.
Gordon kept Marrickville in the field all day, getting
399 for 8 wickets. Kelleway collected an uncom-
monly brisk 114, and Joe Taylor (72), It. C. M.
Boyce (62), and 11. Watts (54 not out) helped the
stolid international. Waverley put together 335 v.
Glebe, but 11. Davis (120) had a bagful of luck;
he was missed three times. Cumberland’s 299 v.
Balmain was contributed to by F. T. Wright (59),
Gar. Waddy (58), and the promising colt, F. Buckle
(54). Windsor, a new Balmain bowler, skittled 5
wickets for 79. Another good performance with the
ball was that of Dight, the Western Suburbs
slow bowler, who got 7 for 79 r. St. George; and
the latter’s left-hander, Liney Wall, was even more
deadly. His record was 6 for 43. Wall deserved a
place in the State XI against S.A. and Vic., but he
was omitted. Manly (172) have Mosman scratching;
the latter are 5 for 97. Petersham (5 for 147) are
the only club with a first innings’ lead, Randwick
falling for 105 before the trundling of W. Wadding-
ton (4 for 27) and Sturt (3 for 45). Most of tne
other matches are in doubt.
* * . * *
The N.S.W. team to play S.A. and Vic-
toria includes Sid Everett (Petersham) and Dr.
Campling (Balmain), who have been getting a lot
of wickets in premiership cricket. Nevertheless, the
bowling is on the weak side, but, with Macartney,
Bardsley, Taylor, Collins, Andrews and Ivippax, the
batting is solidity itself.
“Adeloval”: George Giffen (B. 30/11/’22)
is about to be insulted with a testimonial. Joe
Darling, now the Hon. J. of the Speck, has started it
with 10 guineas. Joseph mentions that the fine old
boy will soon be retiring from the Postal Depart-
ment, in which he works, and that his State owes it
to Giffen that N.S.W. and Vic. were forced to play
hcme-and-home matches with S. Aus. But for this
Lyons, Jones, Hill and Darling might never have
been heard of as front-rank cricketers. In 1896
Giffen influenced the selectors to give Clem Hill
his first trip to England. The S.A. Association has
appointed a sub-committee, including Hill, to make
preliminary arrangements for the fund, and the
proceeds of the Adelaide match between Victoria
and S. Aus. will be handed over to the treasurer.
“Lucius”: They were only boys, but it
was a dinkum match —Melb. Scotch College v.
Geelong Grammar School, under 13. In their last
innings Grammar wanted 59 to win, with 10 minutes
to go. They got 57 of them without the loss of a
wicket, and then a stem-faced man called “time.”
In the first over 17 runs were made; in the second
17, and in the third 18. Sundries added 5.
“Push Off” : Unless the timekeeper was
dreaming, Lily Venning, a 13-year-old Queenslander,
swam. 50yds. last week in 31 l-ssec., which, is only 3
3-ssee. outside the world’s record for the sex.
When Ettie Robertson and Ella Smith fought out such
a desperate finish for the N.S.W. championship over
the distance—Ettie won in 32sec.—Sydney critics
hailed them as prospective world-beaters. But they
are now 16 or thereabouts and neither has lowered
32sec. If the watch wasn’t all wrong the Queens-
land kid is a wonder.

Mel Coogan, the American lightweight,
and Harry Collins, the tough youth from Newcastle
(N.S.W.), provided a fairly big Stadium crowd
with 20 rounds of vigorous boxing, at Rushcuttei’s
Bay on Saturday. The decision should have
gone to Coogan, who had gained a big lead in the
earlier part of Ihe
battle; but Collins
did the better
work in the last
five rounds, and
the referee declared
it a draw. The
contest was
noticeably clean
and fair. Coogan
exhibited cleverer
work than when
he fought Bradley,
but he is not yet
back to his best
U.S. form. When
he strikes it the
present crop of
Australian light-
weights will wish
he had remained
beyond the Pacific.
ALF
STEWART,
who holds the
middleweight
boxing title. He
has twice beaten
Charlie Ring.
The high-jumping was the most interest-
ing feature of Saturday’s Dunn Shield contests at
Sydney. J. K. Harbison (Uni.) cleared sft. llin., which
left him an easy winner. V. R. Harbison, his cousin,
did sft. 84in., and J. Ward (West) sft. fijin. R. J.
Honnor (Uni.) won the 440yds. hurdles in
H. S. Grandemange (Botany) got away with the
three miles in 15min. 54sec., and W. F. Payne
(Police) heaved the awkward discus 111 ft. 6|in.
“Slip” Garr (East Sydney) scampered over the
220yds. in 22 4-ssec., and had yards to spare from
K. Oakes (South) and Tom McNamara (West) —the
last-named .an improving youth, who will be heard
of in days to come. H. R. Turner (Botany) annexed
the half-mile in 2min. 4sec., thanks to W. Hutton’s
awful judgment, and Ernie Austen appropriated the
mile walk in 7min. 30 4-ssec. University was the
most successful combination, with a total of 26
points, next coming Police (18), East (17) and
South (15).
* * * *
“Benicia”: Am not prepared to refute
“O.K.’s” statement (B. 9/11 /’22) that Edmund Payson
Weston constantly chewed the coca leaf in his pedes-
trian performances, but I do say that “0.K.” was wrong
when he concluded that without the aid of the leaf
Weston would have cut no ice at all. Weston’s life
history is all against the theory of dope. Consider
his record. Born in 1839, he walked from Washing-
ton to Boston —453 miles —in 208 hours, to attend
Lincoln’s inauguration. In his first professional
performance, a jaunt from Portland (Maine) to
Chicago, in 1867, he covered 1326 miles in 26 days
of atrocious November weather. The next year he
walked 100 miles on the road in 22 hours 19 minutes.
At the age of 40 he covered 550 miles in 141 hours
44 minutes, and five years later walked 50 miles a
day for 100 consecutive days. In 1906, when 67
years old, he walked 100 miles —from Philadelphia
City Hall to Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York —in 23
hours 54 minutes. The next year he beat his own
youthful record from Portland to Chicago by 29
hours. On his seventieth birthday he set out to walk
from New York to San Francisco in 100 days. He
failed, but covered 3795 miles in 104 days 7 hours.
“0.K.” need no longer “wonder what became of the
chewer.”
* * * *
Adelaide rowing men are angry with the
Citv Council for not keeping Torrens Lake free
from weed. The annual growth beat all previous
records this year, and came early at that, so that
the usual so-called Henley regatta looked like being
ruined. The Corporation put on a few men, but
these made little impression; so the oarsmen stopped
their training and cruised out in heavy boats of
every description, with forks and rakes, to get
something approaching a clear course.
• * * *
A stiff nor’-easter and lumpy water made
the N.S.W. rowing championships on the Parramatta
a test of watermanship. A. G. Bull, who holds the
Australian title, had an easy task in the sculls,
skimming over the Ryde-Searle’s-Monument course
(3 miles 167yds.) in the excellent time of 23min.
21sec. R. Neilson and R. H. Jones were closest to
him at the gun. In the eights, Leichhardt were
no match for Mosman, who won convincingly in
19min. 55sec. The lightweight fours (lit mile
167yds.) went to Balmain, who led Leichhardt and
Mosman home in lOmin. 56sec.

“Past Grammar”: Sydney Uni. Sports
Union has again turned down the ’Varsity Rugby
League club’s periodical application for affiliation.
The rules of the Amateur Federation provide that
anyone infringing the laws made against professional-
ism by any sporting body affiliated with the Federation
is classed as a professional. The Rugby Union, which
permits professional sprinters (like Steel, the All
Black threequarter), professional pugs and almost
every other variety of pro. to play in its ranks,
long ago declared players of the League code pro-
fessionals. Till that ban is lifted, no member of
the Sydney University Sports Union, or any other
amateur, can associate in football with League pro-
fessionals and keep his status. The ’Varsity Leaguers’
claim, that they are technical pros, at worst, won’t
hold water. Last season they played Paddy Cona-
ghan and J. Craig; of the Kangaroos, each of which
men, Craig particularly, has made big cheques for
playing football.
THE RACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here’s Hughes on National —top-weight, of course.
That recent 251 b. penalty
Might prove a stopper for the gamest horse
However admirably trained he be.
The jock.’s a very dynamo of force,
But won’t that smashing impost crush the gee!
Ah, well! ■ We soon shall see.
Here’s Labor, Gardiner upon his back.
How dubiously they seem to eye the prad,
His old admirers on the course and track.
He’s lost the fire and freedom that he had
In other days. In fact, a sorrier hack
Steered by a more dejected-looking lad
’Twere hard to find, begad!
Light-weight, in first-class company untried,
His real capacity ungauged so far,
C.P. curvets along, Earle Page astride.
An equine champion and a pigskin star?
Who knows ? The sequel only will decide
If one can gallop and the other ride.
The packed stands sway. The bookies bet and bar.
Off! Are they off? They are.

How to keep your
nails fashionably
manicured
*
&
m
'FT*
THE chief beauty of the hands is the
nails. The cuticle must be slender,
even, firm. Fortunately, it is no longer
hard to keep the nails lovely.
With Cutex, the safe euticle remover,
you can rid yourself of superfluous
cuticle without cutting.
How to give yourself a
Perfect Manicure
Dip the end of an orange stick
wrapped in cotton wool Ihto the bot-
tle of Cutex and work around the
nail base. Wash the hands; then, when
drying them push the cuticle gently
downwards. The ugly dead cuticle
will simply wipe off.
Then for the gleaming lustre that
makes the perfect manicure, select one
of the four Cutex polishes the heW
Liquid Polish, or the Paste, Powder
or Cake, all of which are quick, lasting
and give the fashionable brilliance.
Cute* manicure sets are in four sizes
“Compact,” the “Five -Minute,
the “Travelling,’’and the “Boudoir’ —all
daintily packed and containing every-
thing needed for a perfect manicure,
They may be obtained at the leading
chemists and stores throughout Aus-
tralia.

“T. 0.1 ”: Apropos “Pick’s” pal 1 . (B.
30/11/’22), concerning Tom Cavanough’s
exploit in holding down the points to guide
a runaway train into a deadend at Peat’s
Ferry (N.S.W.). He did get something—
he got well scalded, the engine-driver hav-
ing opened the pipe. Also,
despite his heroism, there was an accident,
and several persons were killed in it.
“Schnorrer” : One of my best Jewish friends
is Murphy; and another is Jones. I also
hold McAllister in high regard, he being a
good observant Hebrew who has regard to
the Torah, recites the Kiddash and keeps
Youm Kippur- The Yid has a reverence for
family tradition, but he is too broad-minded
to let a mere appellation stand in the way
of business; and the business name usually
sticks to the family. You cannot identify
one-half of the Sydney Jewish community
by the names they use—at least, so Higgs
—who is one of the solidest of the Saturday
morning pilgrims to the Synagogue—assures
me.
“Lou” Atkinson, who recently ’verted to
the Country party, has four opponents for
Wilmot (Tas.). They are Norman Cam-
eron, who sat for several terms in the
Speck Assembly and posed as the candle-
stick for a brief season on the Federal see-
saw ; Campbell, a new C,P. man; Pullen
(Nat.), recently in the State Parliament,
and Palamountain (Lab.), a frequent but
monotonously unsuccessful trier, formerly
a Presbyterian pulpiteer and lately a Laun-
ceston truant-inspector. As Wilmot has
always been two to one anti-Labor, the best
Paletc. can hope to do is to assist in mak-
ing a vote in the division for Ogden, Labor’s
solitary Senate candidate.
A bit of the historic Hordern estate at
the Haymarket has passed into the possession
of Joe Gardiner, Limited, for £33,362 10s,
The corner 50 years ago was occupied by
Patrick R. Larkin as a hay and corn Store,
It was the property of Anthony Hordern,
tertius, he that projected a West Australian
railway on the land-grant system and died
at sea before completing his purpose. His
sons, Arthur Gilbert Hordern and Anthony
Shabra Hordern, great-grandsons of the
original Anthony, were the applicants for
the authority of the Equity Judge which had
to precede the sale,
“Hambone”: Among a batch of seamen
from the Union Company’s steamer Kauri,
hauled before the Newcastle (N.S.W.) beak
for refusing duty, was the donkey-man, a
youth of 63, with the aquiline features, broad
brow and long yellowing beard ascribed to
the ancient prophets. The old chap, it trans-
pired, was willing, personally, to do his share
of taking the ship to sea, but didn’t consider
it the game to stand out against his hot-
headed juniors. Passively he followed the
proceedings of the Court —his the only
immobile countenance among the excusing,
pleading, passionate, protesting, exasper-
ated, artificially-delighted, or too-patiently-
indignant dials of the IT others. De-
spite his present lowly job., he has at
least one friend among the co.’s directors,
and his son-in-law is one of the line's most
trusted skippers. And he is now “doing his
month” in Maitland Gaol, Or
damphoolishness?
_ “U.P.”: Three hundred years ago doctors
didn’t worry much about germs, but they had
many questions of hygiene to wrestle with.
An ancient book, “The Diet of the Diseased
—Doctor in Pliysicke,” was the other day
presented to the Adelaide Public Library
Board by J. P. Roberts, whose father brought
the volume to S. Aus. in ’43-. It Was pub-
lished in 1633 by James Hart, Of London.
Some of the questions diSelfe&ed in the musty
volume are—whether “Water conveied thorow
pipes of lead be wholesome for ordinary use” ;
if it is advisable to “feed freeliest at din-
ner or at supper”; should “snailes be good
against a consumption”; and whether old
men “be allowed the use of wine.”
“L.S.”: The imminent re-orgahiSatiOii of
the Australian oversea meat business re-
minds me that (tradition about H, S. Mart
notwithstanding ) the man who first invented
a practical refrigerating machine was Ofie
Harrison, an early editor of the Melbourne
Age. Harrison was a regular correspondent
of Faraday and Tyndal, and his inventions
pre-dated the successes of Carre and Tellier
in the freezing world by four and eight years
respectively. The first of his machines to
be put to practical Use was erected by Glas-
gows, the Bendigo brewing firm, and it is
claimed that it was the first refrigerator
used commercially in the whole world.
“O’D.”: An old hand of the Brisbane
Water Board reminisced while he fixed a
leaking tap. “We were working on the
Albion-road one day many years ago. Just
as we were enjoying an unofficial smoko, up
drove the then chairman, Mr. L. Bernays.
There was nothing for it but to put up an
audacious bluff, for we were -caught red-
handed ; so, when he asked us why we weren’t
bogging in, we told him that we were from
the Gas Company, not the Water Board. It
went down, but still we thudded. He was
also chairman of the Gas Company !”
“S.T.S.”: The Burford Co., of Adelaide,
resembles the phoenix of fable. It was burnt
out of its Grenfell-street soapworks 40 years
ago, but got busy on a much larger scale in
thte south-western corner of the city. Two
years back that factory also went up in flames,
and now a big place, with a garden suburb
of 150 acres projected alongside, has been
established out at Dry Creek. The original
Burford founded the business in 1840, his
tools of trade being an axe, a boat and a
shovel; he made his own alkali from the
mangroves in the Port River.
“Q.Q.Q.”: “Jimmy Trousers’ ” par. (B.
23/11/’22), re the possibility of dyes being
extracted from the eucalypts, recalls the fact
that Mrs. Eady Hart, of Ballarat (Vic.),
after experimenting for over 30 years, has
succeeded in perfecting a range of vegetable
dye colors. From the eucalyptus alone she
can extract 100 shades. Applying for her
first patent in 1914, her patent rights have
been completed in Australia, Great Britain,
India and America. Mrs. Hart declares that
the Australian bush could supply the whole
world with dyes.


Violet Blue Eyes.
By “PHLOX.”
T WAS a wallflower again last night,
mother.”
* “Most unfortunate, my dear, most
unfortunate. I can’t think who you take
after; certainly net after me. Anyway, we
must try and marry you off.”
“Suppose I don’t w r ant to marry?”
“I’m not going to Suppose anything of
the sort.”
“But if no man asks me?”
“Then, you’ve got to do your part, and
see that he does.”
“That I’ll never do.”
“Then you’d better go into a nunnery.”
“No, mother; that wouldn’t suit me. I’m
too fond of the joys of the world.”
“What about going to the Islands as a
missionary ?”
“And run the chance of being eaten?”
“Whatever you do in this world, my dear,
you have to take your chance.”
“Anyway, mine’s not going to be in the
Cannibal Islands.”
“By the way, Millicent, w T hat are you
wearing for the dance on Tuesday?”
“I’m not going to the dance.”
“Not going! Why?”
“I overheard that horrid Talbot girl say
to Bessie Myers that my skin was blotchy,
and my hair like rats’ tails.”-
“How very rude of her.”
“Rude! I call it beastly. Anyway, I
have a grain of comfort. Jack Summers
says that I have lovely violet-blue eyes.”
“Of course you have.”
* * * *
Instead of going to the dance Millicent
had Jones drive her to the home of Mrs.
Douglas—a friend of whom she was very
fond.
“I’m delighted to see you, dear,” was Mrs.
Douglas’s greeting; “but I understood you
to say that you were going to a dance to-
night.”
“I w r as, but—er—well, I’m tired of being
a wallflower.”
“I’m sorry, dear. Did you enjoy that
book I lent you?”
“I did, indeed; especially where Trine
says that you can usually be what you make
up your mind to be. Now, I want to be
beautiful. Do you think if I desire beauty
long enough, and earnestly enough, it will
ever come to me?”
“It will, dear, if, as well as desiring, you
take practical means of assisting nature.”
“I would love to, I wonder if you would
be kind enough to advise me?”
“In the first place you need a good cream
that will nourish, and at the same time
remove the discoloration from your skin.”
“I did use a cream, and that horrid hair
you see on my face is the result.”
“So many creams do grow hair on the
face; but have you ever tried mercolized
wax ?”
“No; I’ve heard of it. I thought, how-
ever, that it, too, might favor the growth
of hairs.”
“Not at all, dear. I’ve used it for quite
a long time. You’ve heard of Frenchwomen
going into retirement during Lent, and hav-
ing the skin of their faces and necks re-
moved by a painful process.”
“Yes; I’ve read about it.”
“Well, mercolized wax has the same effect
without causing any pain or inconvenience.
At night, before retiring, you simply wash
your face in warm water, using a good
soap—I always use Pilenta Soap—then
apply the wax to your face and neck.
Wash it off in the morning, and before
powdering rub in a little of the mercolized
wax, which is obtainable from most good
chemists. Instead of ordinary powder I
always use cleminite, which gives that soft
velvety bloom to the complexion.
“For those blackheads on your nose and
chin, stymol tablets are the best cure. Drop
a tablet in a tumbler of hot water, and when
the fizzing has subsided bathe the face with
the liquid. After drying you will find that
the blackheads have come out on the towel.
“For the hairs on your face there’s
nothing better than powdered pheminol,
which removes the hairs without disfiguring
the skin.”
“How very fortunate I met you, Mrs.
Douglas.”
“Now, for your hair. The first thing to
be done is to shampoo it with stallax!”
“Yes, I’ve written that down. But I don’t
suppose you know of anything that will
keep my hair in curl?”
“Yes, I do —something, in fact, that will
make it curl.”
“How marvellous!”
“It’s a perfectly simple preparation, called
silmerine, which you can get at the chemist’s
and you apply on retiring at night. Brush
your hair out in the morning, when it will
be beautifully wavy, and any short pieces
curly.”
“Oh, how lovely that will be! You can’t
think what a load you’ve taken off my mind.
Now if you would only .prescribe something
for my red hands. I’m so ashamed of them.”
“I can, dear, give you a prescription that
I’ve tried myself with the best results. Add
bierolium jelly to your list of wants from
the chemist. This pleasant, non-greasy sub-
stance quickly blanches the hands, removes
tan, clears out the dirt which soap cannot
reach, and makes the skin soft, white and
smooth.”
“How clever of you, Mrs. Douglas, to
know all these things.”
“I’ve just found them out by degrees.”
“Oh, there’s Jones for me. Good-night,
Mrs. Douglas; I don’t know how to thank
you.”
“Don’t, dear; but consistently nse what
I have told you. When you have improved
your skin and hair you will be quite beauti-
ful, and should make many conqaasts with
those pretty violet-blue eyes.”

Oscar Asche may add to his fame as a
producer by his version of “Julius Ctesar,”
now running at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, but
it makes his limitations cruelly patent, both
as an actor and an interpreter of Shaks-
peare. It is not, of course, his fault that
there is no part in the play that could pos-
sibly fit him physically. It is beyond art —
even beyond the toga—to make a convincing
Antony out of a figure that suggests a pros-
perous butcher just elected to an alderman’s
job. The Antony of this period was
several years younger than the “Mailed
Bacchus” who leapt iuto Cleopatra’s arms,
contented there to die, and the time has gone
by when Asche was capable of any such
eurhythmical feat, even if he could find
arms capable of accommodating him.
Apart from this, all the subtlety of Shaks-
peare’s creation is lost in Asche’s handling
of the part. He must needs bray out, as
through a megaphone, what finer actors are
content to indicate. The mob at the funeral
oration is, in his conception, an instrument
which must be seen and heard responding to
his every sentence. He has to play on it
like a concertina. It even begins by hurling
a few cabbage-stalks at him to make its
subsequent conversion to unrestrained en-
thusiasm the more telling.
There are some other bizarre touches in-
troduced, presumably to impress one with
the actor-manager’s superior knowledge of
Julian Rome in certain directions denied to
the playwright. Casca chews an orange or
a lemon in the intervals of relating
what happened at the Lupercal, return-
ing the fruit to his pocket at inter-
vals as a London costermonger might
on Epsom Downs. And the Romans of
those days, one gathers, conspirators or
otherwise, didn’t shake hands, hut affection-
ately gripped one another’s elbows. lan
McLean played Julius Caesar very finely.
Cecil Humphreys and George Ide, as
Brutus and Cassius, were dwarfed and made
to look rather weedy nobles, and even their
voices suffered somewhat, because of An-
tony’s bulk and stridency. Still, the his-
toric quarrel was well rendered. Of the
others John Cave gave an excellently
blunt Casca, even with the handicap of his
orange. Miss Doris Champion was a solici-
tous Calpurnia, and Miss Gladys Mason a
tender and clinging Portia. The play was
admirably staged, the lighting effects being
entirely commendable novelties.
There are six more nights in which to
make or renew acquaintance with Lawrence
Grossmith and Diana Wilson in “The Silver
Fox” at Sydney Cri. Then the decks will
be cleared for “Cinderella,” J. C. William-
son’s gorgeous Christmas pantomime, which
is to be a vision splendid and a thing of joy.
“The Arcadians” (“a short life and a gay
one”), has another week of crowded merri-
ment before it will give place, at Sydney
Theatre Royal, to “The Eyes of Youth.”

established favorites with Sydney audiences,
will be seen, on December 23, with a fine
cast in what is claimed as a genuine drama-
tic novelty.
At Fuller’s Theatre, Sydney. “Spangles”
is getting well into its stride. It’s a bright
and remarkably pleasing entertainment, or
series of them, which shows that Ada Reeve
is as potent a draw as ever, and that her
company of London artists are a band of
essentially pleasing go-as-you pleasers.
Will Collin son made his first appearance,
at Sydney Tivoli last Saturday.. He is
reminiscent of Rickaby, but a mile or so
behind him in class. Lee White and Clay
Smith are on their last lap, but May Sher-
rard shows no sign of waning. Eric God-
ley is back, and his resonant baritone is
heard to great effect in old-time ballads.
Newcomers commanding attention are Max
and Ray, ice-skaters, and Colleano, the amaz-
ing wire-walker.
Tom Meighan has entered politics, and
appears this week at Sydney Lyceum as “Our
Leading Citizen.” Wanda Hawley is the
girl artist in “A Kiss in Time.” Between
these two flickers there is a xylophone inter-
lude, ironically branded “A Dream of
Melody.” The Rialto has imported Clara
Kimball Young. The Globe opens its doors
to a domestic conundrum called “The Blind-
ness of Divorce.” Hoyt’s affirms that
“Youth Must Have Love.” The Palace
features “Papua and Her People,” but the
dusky ones are shortly to be moved on to
make room for “A Dinkum Bloke,” an Aus-
tralian picture, with Tal Ordpll and Arthur
Tauehert in it. The Gish sisters are the
high lights that balance the deep shadows
in “Orphans of the Storm” at the Strand.

thrown off certain bad habits and one doubt-
ful influence. The latter is traceable to
Corot, who was a master of landscape paint-
ing, and whose work would be tremendously
helpful if it taught students to see their
pictures as a whole as he saAv his, instead of
in sections, as Lloyd Rees did while paint-
ing many of the studies included in his
show. This painter’s bad habits lie mostly
in concentrating on relatively unimportant
details and exploiting formulas in the
treatment of furrowed roads and tree
shadows on grass. The result is a lack of har-
mony and a texture suggestive of engraved
ebony. Where his faults are least in evi-
dence, as in “The Farm,” “Distant View,
Parramatta,” and “The Red House,” his
work is better and healthier than that of
many men with bigger reputations.
The Victorian Opera Co., of which E. H.
Hanstein is conductor and guide, tried “Les
Cloches de Corneville” on a small audience at
Melbourne Playhouse on Saturday night.
From the start the superior freshness and
confidence of Ida Roy Ashton and Minnie
Fraatz made the men noticeable in their
uneasy solemnity. Miss Ashton infected Ser-
polette with the dash and brightness of a
successful professional soubrette, and her
sweet, well-moulded soprano was equal to
every tuneful occasion. Miss Fraatz handled
Germaine without a trace of self-conscious-
ness, , but Frank Salmon, as the Mar-
quis de Corneville, appeared to be
stricken with a sort of polite som-
nambulism, though he put plenty of life
into a gracious concert baritone of consider-
able range and strength. The vocalist shone
whilst the actor slumbered in Edric Bick-
ford’s Grenicheux, and Dave Rose depicted
the Baillie’s suet, without approaching his
high note of foolish pomposity. Fred Reinke,
as Gobo, endeavored to make some humorous
reparation for the failure of his colleagues, and
his cheerful disposition was welcome on that
account. J. D. Stoyle was determined not
to squander his small talent on Gaspard, the
Miser. In fact, the dramatic definition given
to the character amounted to a pittance. In
two or three instances the legs and general
behavior were too young for Gaspard. The
buxomness of Aileen Hogan, as Christophe,
scored many points, especially as the bulk
of the chorus belonged to the bantam divi-
sion.

The last nights of “Mary,” at Melbourne
Her Majesty’s, are heavy with sorrow over the
impending departure of Maude Fane for a
much-advertised farm in Surrey, where it is
her ambition to grow mangel-wurzels and
other fruits for the London market. Sou-
venir photos of the divinity were handed
round on Monday, and about the end of the
current week her fluttering admirers, includ-
ing several hardened critics, will roll up to
give her a tempestuous farewell.

“The Peep Show” is to be retired from
Melbourne Royal to-morrow night. On
Saturday “The Maid of the Mountains” will
swagger in, and a fresh Baldasarre (Anew
McMaster) will snuggle up to the vision in
the last chapter. McMaster, who was not
previously suspected of a genius for beauteous
bandit characters, will be faintly remem-
bered for stencilling a minor part in that
woeful Irish tragedy, “Paddy, the Next Best
Thing.”
* * * *
Ethel Hook has returned to restore the
dignity of Melbourne Tivoli, somewhat dam-
aged by the gyrations of Gene Gerrard as
the weird Blotto and Stage Electrician.
Clara Butt’s tall and melodious sister adds
to the vocal wealth of a programme, to
which the “Monks of St. Beimard” are con-
tributing their best. A violinist, Bartini,
has also come in, so the show is losing some
of its circus aspects and is beginning to
look more like a Conservatorium break-up.
“The Sentimental Bloke” ends its long
and prosperous spin at Melbourne King’s
next Saturday night. The piece has been
greatly improved since the opening night,
and as it will be further amended as fresh
opportunities for laughs occur to its author,
it shouldn’t know its old self hy the time it
reaches its first birthday. Next week it
goes to Sydney to start another box-office
sensation at the Palace.
Rex Beach’s yarn, “The North Wind’s
Malice,” is presenting pictures of cool Wiz-
ards and other winter effects to the swelter-
ing populace at Melbourne Majestic. The
Majestic’s beauty show for the current week
is Corinne Griffith, whereof “Received Pay-
ment” gives delectable report. At Hoyt’s
Lyceum “Fool’s Paradise” is drawing a lot
of sightseers who are familiar with the loca-
lity. At Hoyt’s De Luxe “Forever” is the
Title of the masterpiece, wherein Elsie Fer-
guson and Wallace Reid foregather and face
one another with yearning faces. “What’s
Wrong with the Woman?” provides material
for several arguments at the Britannia. The
Melba has “The Woman Who Walked Alone”
into a strange man’s bedroom at midnight,
and the poignancy of the situation has started
a strong demand for ice-cream and fans.
Adelaide’s Serenaders on the Exhibition-
terrace, are of the usual type, plus some ela-
borate Willi,amsonian scenic effects. Hugh
and Edith Huxham are in charge. Renn
Millar and Madoline Knight sing finely, and
George Welch is a reliable low comedian.
Business has been very big. Otherwise, be-
yond some good concerts and a sound variety
team at the Majestic, with Dampier at the
top of the bill, the city is offered naught
but pictures. At West’s, Norma Talmadge
shows the French Court of olden times in
“The Eternal Flames,” and the York is
attracting the girls with “The Storm.” The
Pav. has “Dream Street”; and at Wonder-
graph Wanda Hawley in “A Kiss in Time”
is a good girl who was (for a wager) kissed
within an afternoon of the stakes being
lodged.
“T.P.” : “Lear” (B. 9/11/’22) was done
by William Creswick, in Melbourne Bijou.
I went the first night, but forget the date.
Regan and Goneril were nervous, and the
cue wouldn’t come for the great curse scene.
So the tragedian started without, and he
had just got into his stride when the actress
chirped the lines. Creswick’s sotto voce
observations were never written by the Bard.
“T.W.”: Chirgwin had been ailing for
many months before he went where the good
mock-niggers go. Nobody did less in a long
lifetime to vary his variety business. As a
youngster of eight I saw Chirgwin give a
turn exactly the same in every detail as
the one he was doing three years back. He
became an inveterate grouser in later years,
for he had seen Leno, Lauder, Robev and a
lot of others rise and pass him on the way.
“Dido”: There are a good singer and a
bad singer on the Tivoli programme, Melb.,
at the time of writing. The bad singer
is appreciated (not being so very bad), but
the good singer is an emphatic success.
There is a bad sketch and there is a good
sketch. The bad sketch excites no particu-
lar enmity, but the good sketch is the tri-
umph of the night. In all my experience I
never knew a decidedly good sketch-turn to
fail on the Tivoli stage, and this includes
the period wfien it was the Opera House and
Rickards was specialising in good sketches.
There is nothing more popular. Burr and
Hope, who provide “A Belle, a Beau and a
Balcony,” have a bright sketch (although
the male element is too obviously fed with
openings for smart retort), and they are an
exuberant success. Why don’t we get more
sketches? It is a dramatic form that calls
for small stage acumen, and there are a score

of writers in Australia who could turn them
out if guaranteed a market. Ti e Musgroves
might get a tiny company and give it a
trial, appealing first for sketches as an assur-
ance that our scribes can deliver the goods.
The town-clerk’s story :
Any Poverty Pointer ever heard that great opera
“Saratoga” ? Perhaps not. “Saratoga” was staged
in Puketapu, Otago (M.L.), for one consecutive
night during the winter of 1909. There had
been just enough watered sunshine to convert a
recent snowfall into slush half-a-foot deep when he
blew into my office—an old gentleman, tali and
strong-visaged, who might have been an inspector-
general, but announced himself as an actor. He
tendered a sovereign for the hire of the town hall
(a draughty shed, let out at 10 bob a night), and
from the change he paid another five bob to have
his show adequately advertised. That job I passed
on to Bluenose, my staff, who had an outsize in
cowbells. “Saratoga” was an unqualified success.
At 8 o’clock 31 adults and 45 children had passed
in (I was in the box-office). At 8.15 we bor-
rowed three forms from the school, and when
the curtain ascended at 8.20 the shed was crowded.
The old chap played six parts, four of which were
Koko, Jack Point, the Duke of Plaza Toro and Dick
Deadeye. But he was not more versatile than the
lady member of the company, who was Yum Yum,
Katisha and Little Buttercup, a wild soubrette and
a demented heroine, just as the occasion, and her
husband, demanded. At the triumphant close there
were deafening demands for a repetition on the
following night, but the old actor said he must pay
the pub score and pass on, as J.C.W. had engaged
them to start in Auckland. It was quite true.
Howard Yernon and his young wife loomed large in
comic opera in those days.
On Australian films in other lands:—
“Silks and Saddles,” the racing film made by
Wells and released in America as “Queen of the
Turf,” not only -found a quick market in the States,
but sold for a good price in London, when the
market was at a low ebb. The agent who took
“Australia’s Wild Nor’-West” to Berlin also had
“Silks and Saddles” in his grip, but the mark fell
with such a thud that all chances of disposing of
the Aussie pitchers at a profitable figure vanished. The
state of the continental market is so bad that it is
hardly worth while shipping a film to any European
country. A cash payment is quite out of the ques-
tion, all film business being transacted by means of
bills extending over months —a system quite foreign
to my notions of picture business. Beaumont Smith
should at least get away with the revised edition
of “The Man from Snowy River,” which he is offer-
ing to the trade in London, as several good judges,
including the agent who placed “Silks,” consider the
Banjo Paterson film-story a certain seller. But
Beau, found it necessary to chop any local gags or
bits of business. Battling around the film markets
of the world with Aussie productions wakes one up
to the fact that our island continent is a long way
off, especially in the mind of the New Yorker, who
invariably gets it tangled up with M.L. and the
islands where the cannibals come from. I politely
told a Yank that Australia wasn’t so far away bht
that it could be flooded with sewing-machines, auto-
mobiles, pork and beans —and blood-curdling movies,
- —all the products of U.S.A., and that good Aussie
cash was returned in exchange. When the Aussie pro-
ducer wakes up to the fact that he must make a
film on cosmopolitan lines —a good story set amongst
the tall timber, or the goldfields, with a little abo. life
thrown in—he will find a ready market in the U.S.A.,
England and on the Continent. I must say that
the Swedish producers are miles ahead of anyone
who has ever put a film together in Australia. But
their stuff fails to find a market in England and
America because the stories are too local in color.
The latest move of the Swedish Biograph Co. is to
engage English artists to play in a strong sea-going
film with the idea of capturing a world market.
They have been compelled to produce an article for
general consumption. Here, in New York, it is a
puzzle to find a theatre running a British or Conti-
nental subject, but I am convinced that the managers
will give any make of film a go provided it has
the pulling power and brings some new angle of life
or atmosphere along with it.

The Bulletin is glad to be the bearer of
tidings of great joy to a Poverty Point
denizen hight Nelson Emery. He has come
in for money, and will be shown the way
to it if he communicates with J. 11. Booth,
Melbourne secretary of the Actors’ Federa-
tion of Australia.
“Orb” : S. M. Herald’s linotype man puts
it this way in a critique of “The Arcadians” :
Mr. Mayne Lynton, known to Sydney fame as “The
Bar,’’ had the thankless part of Sir George Pad-
dock.
“The Bar” is unkind, Lynton being the
soberest of mummers. Of course, “The Bat”
was intended, and it’s not such a big jump
from drama to comic opera—always sup-
posing “The Bat” to be drama and “The
Arcadians” comic opera. Shakspeare makes
Hamlet say:
d paddock, from a bat.
“Stargazer”: For some considerable time
at one period, Harry Rickards kept a couple
of serios for the express purpose of playing
the people out. He had tried an all-excel-
lent programme, and finding the audience
lingering and demanding encores, when it
should have been well off home, he changed
his tactics again, and finished up with a
young couple, of whom he said : “They may
be abused by the critics, and the public may

scoff at them, but they’re well worth their
money. Why, they empty the house like a
fire.” A little later he went to the bright
pair, and he said : “See here, you two, you’ve
been getting some applause lately, and it is
only fair to warn you that if you go on
improving you’ll d—n well have to go. As
it is, I could get a worse couple for two-
thirds of what I’m paying you.”
“T.W.”: There is not much warrant for
"Whitehall’s” assertion (B. 23/11/’22) that
Cissie Loftus has recently found "no crying
demand for her services.” Last month the
lady was a big liner at London Coliseum,
where only the large planets shine, and she
was also due to appear at a Chappell ballad
concert. There the programmes usually
include some very popular humorist as relief
for a monotonous procession of tame
“royalty” songs.
"I’am”: Irma Caron, daughter of the late
Leon, made her American debut on Broadway
at the palatial Capitol Theatre. S. L.
Rothafel, director of the Capitol, gave her
a hearing after the show one night, and was
so impressed with the Caron voice that he
definitely engaged her after she had sung
her first number. Incidentally, Alfred Hill,
the Maoriland composer, is getting a good
boost, for Irma is to sing his “Waita Poi,”
with her deft poi accompaniment, which
made a hit at the Philharmonic and Royal
Albert halls in London. Erno Rapee, the
Capitol musical director,, has arranged the
M.L. song for his symphony orchestra of
172 players—one of the finest in the world.
"J.O’M.”: "Second Murderer” (B.
9/11/’22) and “Arviragus” (B. 30/11/’22)
are both wrong in saying that “King Lear”
was last played in Sydney by W. E. Sheri-
dan at the Queen’s. I saw him do the thing
at the Gaiety, supported by a scratch com-
pany, some time after the Queen’s had been
condemned. This was about 1886. Some
months later Sheridan collapsed while view-
ing a performance at the Opera House, York-
street. J. H. Rainsford was with him at
the time.
“C. Ockney”:
The newest theat-
rical member of
the House of Com-
mons is Alfred
Butt, who, as a
youngster, earned
a weekly wage at
Harrod’s, then a
rather paltry store
on the south side
of the Brompton-
road, London, but
now an emporium
where you can buy
anything from a
packet of pins to
a cage of elephants.
Butt controls many
AVest End theatres,
and also bosses
various vaudeville
circuits in town
and country. He
first came into pro-
minence as man-
ager of the Palace,
Shaftesbury-
avenue, succeeding
the venerable
Charles Morton.
His latest activi-
ties include the
directorship o f
Drury Lane, where
liis first venture,
“D ecameron
Nights,” has turned
out a winner and
revived the for-
tunes of the his-
toric playhouse. A
real live showman
is Butt, M.P.
Alec Carroll, of
Fullers', owner of the
famous “Stick,” on
which is carved the
names of all the had
actors and actresses
who have played in
Australia during the
past SO or 40 years.
“Machete” : Can any of those P. Pointers
who have ’ been discussing George Rignold
tell me whether he ever appeared in panto-
mime in Australia. In H. J. Jennings’s
“Chestnuts and Small Beer” there is a re-
ference to a production of “Cinderella” by J.
H. Chute’s slock company in Bristol. The
cast included Madge Robertson (later Mrs.
Kendall), Georgina Hodson (Mrs. Labou-
chere) and one George Rignold, who played
the Baron. William Rignold, Charles Cogh-
lan and W. H. Vernon, all names familiar to
Australians, are also mentioned as members
of Chute’s co.
“Park Royal” : “The Arcadians” was the
success of the 1909 London season, and Les-
ter was chiefly to blame. He made a hit
as Doody, although difficulty was experi-
enced in getting him to grasp the humor of
the part. Tom Walls, the original Doody
in Australia, duplicated Lester’s actions,
make-up and intonations. There wasn’t
much money behind the show, and at the
outset salaries were small. Dan Rolyat
drew £5O p.w.; Phyllis Dare, £45; Lester,
£35; Florence Smithson, £3O; Harry Welch-
man, £10; and Nelson Keys, now a star of
great magnitude, £5. Marie Blanche and
Cicely Debenham got 40 bob apiece for sing-
ing in the chorus.
“Santander” : Edward Landor, who is play-
ing Uncle Jim in Dennis’s “Sentimental
Bloke,” is about the best Polonius I have
seen. He brought out the futility and old-
womanishness of the character with Allan
Wilkie, for whom he played sundry other
Shakspearean parts. Few theatregoers re-
member that he first appeared here with the
“Glad Eye” co., starring Ethel Dane, and
buckled up many a houseful of late diners
with his diverting impersonation of a bogus
medium of lowly birth and conversation.
Landor, who is no relation to the author of
“Imaginary Conversations,” did much good
work for Miss Horniman’s and other Reper-
tory shows in England.
“Norbell”: Why does “T.W.” cite jhe
Brough-Boucicault co. as an Australian cstn-
bination (B. 30/11/'22)V It was nothing
of the kind. Brou'/.i had no use for Aus-
tralian mummers. Before me is the pro-
gramme of “Caste,” the production which
old hands sigh over as the perfection of
comedy—Lyndal, Titheradge, Anson, Brough,
Findlay, Miss Homer, Mrs. Brough and
Pattie Browne. The last-named was the
only Aussie in the bunch. I remem-
ber one B. and B. production in which
a lot of people were wanted for a ballroom
scene. Supers wouldn’t do, so Brough roped
in all Poverty Point. One chap told me
his experiences, and was quite proud of out-
witting Robert. Said he :
He may have an edge on Australians, but I made
my silent bit a speaking part on the first night. I
was dancing with a lady and telescoped Brough as
he came on, nearly skittling him. Involuntarily I
said, “Oh, I beg pardon!” But damme, sir, he had
me on the carpet afterwards for gagging!”
“Thor”: Elfen Terry has been uncover-
ing a Siddons memorial in Bath. There
the Theatre Royal is preserved intact with
its old-fashioned pit, in which the most
fashionable seated themselves, when Gar-
rick and Macklin strutted and drank deep.
Among the' few showbills kept in its foyer
is one of George Rignold’s “Henry the
Fifth,” and it was while gaping at this
memento that I struck acquaintance with
W. F. Grant, a capable actor, who was in
Australia for years, playing Taffy to Edith
Crane’s Trilby, and other parts. He was then
leading man in “Leah Kleshna” at Gar-
rick’s old showhouse.
“L.E.” : There should never have been any
mystery about the success of Florence Aus-
tral Fawaz, now regarded as the greatest
Wagnerian singer heard in London for years.
At a students’ operatic performance, given
some years ago in Melbourne (she warbled
Weber), it was clear to everybody, except
some thick-eared critics, that her dramatic
soprano had beautiful quality as well as rare
power. With many other people who had
no claim to be prophets, except Fritz Hart,
who knew from the first, I agreed that the
big, rather awkward girl would be the Brun-
hilde of the future- —an easy prophecy.
Florence is still as simple and unspoiled as
ever. Asked by an Australian friend, just
after her first triumph at Covent Garden,
how she felt before that vast crowd, who
recalled her again and again with the wildest
enthusiasm, she replied that she only wanted
the curtain to fall and get away home to
bed.
“Dido”: At one time a tenor of Italy
and a soprano of Berlin were singing in grand
opera in Melbourne, and they hated each
other so bitterly that in duets and holds
in love-scenes the soprano, between spasms of
song, would address the tenor sotto voce as
“Pig-dog!” “Beast!” “Dirta brute!”
“Squealing hog!” and class him with other
unclean beasts. The tenor, when it was his
moment off. addressed similar epithets to
the frau, ridiculing her fat, and hurling con-
tumely at her large feet. The result of this
bitterness was an infusion of warmth into
the love-scene in Traviata that captured all
hearts. The critics said that the scene was,
if anything, a little too realistic; but the
public greeted it with storms of applause.
The result of their triumph was that the
frau fell upon the signor’s neck one night
after a third encore, and weeping called him
“Der great singer ! Der loofely man !” The
Italian kissed her back, and called her “La
Gloria,” and all was calm and bright. But
the pair never got another hand for that
love-scene.
“Norbell”: That dynamic little woman,
Peggy Pryde, nightly descanted at a Sydney
vaudeville show on the deceits and infideli-
ties of Man. “Men, they call themselves,”
she sneered, “I wouldn’t trust one of ’em.”
And all the while her husband stood in the
wings as moral support. Peggy and her
old man have been settled in Sydney for
some years. When he joined up with the
A.I.F. she followed him to England, “not
that I could be of much use, but it seemed
good to be within cooree while he was in
France,” she says. He is in business in
Sydney, and detests the stage, but the lure of
the limes still proves too much for Peggy’s
domesticity now and then. She first appeared
in Australia in 1902, as a top-liner for Harry
Rickards.
“Floater” : Reginald de Courville, the 35-
year-old revue producer, who failed for a
vast sum in London the other day, took a
very short time to become a matter of cheerful
interest to the British Income Tax Depart-
ment. De Oourville, the son of an impecunious;
French nobleman, started on the Inky Way
earning about 30s. a week by freelance work
for the Evening News and Weekly Des-
patch. Meeting Sir Tea Lipton in 1909, he
was introduced to Sir Edward Moss, chaii’-
man of the big vaudeville combine, and shot
into a gilded berth as Moss’s secretary,
which he changed on the latter’s death in
1912 for a position of practical control of
the company. At the height of his affluence
De Courville was earning £12,000 a year.
“J.H.” (London) : I saw the first filmed
presentation of Clemence Dane’s “A Bill of
Divorcement.” at the New Gallery cinema,
Leonard Xchon, at
Sydney Tivoli
"Ihirc ye heard the
great and ytorioua
new! Harry Lauder
in 'living £5000 to the
widow of the un-
known soldier."
Regent-street. Fay
Compton’s imper-
sonation of the
wife puts her right
in the front rank
o f pitcher act-
resses. There is
no one in Eng-
land to compare
with her. Watch-
ing the show were
Clemence Dane
and G.B.S. The
former, a very
handsome woman,
told me that it was
only the second
film she had seen,
and confessed after-
wards, at a
luncheon given by
the New Gallery
directors, that the
artistic possibili-
ties of the pitchers
had only just
dawned on her.
Fay Compton held
forth wittily, and
with a wealth of
. epigram. Her art,
both on the stage
and on the screen,
is unquestionable,
and she has beauty
withal. And she
is not yet 25.
Shaw wasn’t en-
thusiastic. “I
found the film as
depressing as the
play,” he said.
“M.A.”: Clive Ciivalli, who opens with a
novel animal act at Sydney Tivoli on Satnr-
day, claims, in the teeth of the theorists,
that it is “all done by kindness.” His argu-
ment is that, as regards dogs, anyhow, you
can’t train them in any other way. If
encouraged by rewards they will give results,
but if beaten they lose their spirit, cringe
and become useless. Still more is this the
case, he says, with monkeys who, provided
their affection is gained, can be made to
do practically anything, but who, once fright-
ened—and they are easily frightened—never
forgive and never forget. Ciivalli is will-
ing to present S.P.C.A. investigators and
others who believe that all trick animals
are ill-treated, to his ponies, dogs, etc., in
private, and it is to be hoped that someone
takes up the challenge. Any good judge of
a dog, say, should be able to tell in short
order what treatment it has had from its
owner.
■ ' Gsesar’s Ghost”: A consequence of the
riot which closed Henry Lee’s Australian
the ni £ ht that it: opened (B.
7/12/22) was the passing to Edmund Dug-
gan of the name part in “Cyrano de Ber-
geiac. Duggan beefed out the poetic lines
so as to make them melodramatic meat
worthy of being served in a Billandersonian
theatrical restaurant. Months later I met
iadmund m company with old-time Phil
Walsh (here with the Irish Players), in
Wellington (M.L.), on a Sunday afternoon
t tune when all Wellington promenades
Q} la y, Manners and Willis streets
and right along to the Victoria-parade. In-
cautiously I went into ecstasies over Cy-
rano, referring particularly to the line about
w£s^!°> Ve: Tv ’ all my excellencies are
within Duggan felt it necessary to recite
the whole passage, with appropriate ges-
tures, in the middle of Willis-street. Then
he remembered other passages, and recited
those, too. The crowd eddied about us,
staring as we paced on, and some of it
trooped in procession after us, determined to
see the tun. In low tones I mentioned to
uggan that we were exciting notice. “Yes”
® ai ? ® ddy rapturously, “they know mah,
f ad -^® y ! ove nmh!.’ He was still declaim-
ing in an impassioned manner when I slipped
away.
, . (London) : Claude Arundale,
biother of the dainty Sybil, has taken the
last call. He had been making a brave but
miini SS , fi S ht „ agamst an illness which, due
“ a “Y y to German H.E., had gradually
paralysed him. Sybil tore herself away
from engagements to help him in the fight,

ON THE ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’re taking to the road again,
The blithest troupe you’ve seen.
We’ve boxed the limelight, packed the rain,
Fixed up our snow-machine,
Made props and scenery,
A right good company.
The movies reign, so we must go
Out on the road once more.
Sometimes it’s cold and drear, I know:
I’ve faced it all before.
Yet things look bright to-day,
To-morrow, we’re away.
We number seven in our cast,
Sound actors, one and all;
Good girls, true pals, from first to last
Whatever may befall,
Who’ll take the best or worst,
A hunger or a burst.
From Dingo Flat to Emu Downs
We’ll pass, a welcome boon,
Through all the little country towns.
They’ll love “The Octoroon,”
And crowd the hall each night
For Little Willie’s flight.
Wo’ll have adventures, never fear,
The artist’s ups and downs ;
And sometimes water, sometimes beer,
But oftener smiles than frowns.
With light Bohemian load
We’ll soon be on the road.
VICTORIA.

Although I am a safely razor I never ca’canny. My job is to see that you
get the maximum output of shaves from every Valet blade.
My method is simple—'just stropping, wonderfully accurate stropping'—and
I do it myself, so that I know the job is properly done.
You will find that a razor which strops itself is as great an improvement as
a motor car which starts itself. It is even better because it means more
“mileage” per blade.
Stop at the next good razor shop you pass and ask the man behind the
counter to show you the “Valet” Auto Strop Razor, then I’ll show you how
I strop myself. ,
THE STANDARD SET No. 1 consists of heavily silver-plated, self-stropping '‘Valet" Auto Strop Razor, 12 27/^5

Make this Christinas
Brighter with a
REXONOLA
This Christmas is an opportune time to
give—or own —a Rexonola. Christmas
festivities are incomplete without music—
and a Rexonola is the best expression of
all music.
The highest praise that can be given to
any talking-machine is that it doesn’t
sound like a talking-machine; it is more
lifelike, more natural—tone-perfected by
the exclusive Rexonola Patented Reflec-
tor Sound Chamber.
The Rexonola will never become out-of-date, for its
basic principle of construction is scientifically right-—the
principle that a particular formation of the sound
chamber is necessary to secure correct “tone focus.” That
principle has been discovered and embodied in the
Rexonola. Being fully protected by patents it cannot be
imitated on any other talking-machine.
The moderately-priced models illustrated all possess
this exclusive feature. Other models of Rexonolas (all
having the Rexonola Patented Reflector Sound
Chamber) are priced as follows:
TABLE MODELS £3/7/6 to £l9.
CABINET MODELS £l9 to £45.
PERIOD MODELS £47/10/- to £62/10/-
Rexonolas are sold by hundreds of Talking-machine
Dealers throughout Australasia. If there is no Rexonola
dealer near you, write direct to the manufacturers,

.... Fredk. P.: “Summer Clothing” just a little
bit too thin.... The Rolling Stone: Sorry, not up.
. ...Warboy: The second article was a reply to the
first; the controversy cannot be prolonged. .. .Yahoo:
What sort of verse do we want? Well, not banali-
ties hammered into doggerel... .E.G. (Junee) :
Joseph Cook was Prime Minister of the Common-
wealth when Britain declared war on Germany. . . .
Wild Oat: It was Henry Stephen, the Judge, not
Henry Parkes, the Premier, who honeymooned at the
Black Horse Inn at Richmond. .. .J.S.C.: An old
theme handled in the old way. .. .R.L.M.: The advice
to boys to stay at home is not exactly seething with
interest... .F.T.: “Chapel-street” is nicely done, but
too thin.... Marcus: Imitation verse of that sort is
fraudulent rubbish... .J.H.L.: Lacks interest....
M.P.C.: “The Bushranger” is a dreary narration in
very middling verse. .. .John B.: Not our sort....
W.M.W.: So many initials clash that it is now
impossible to tell. Not likely to be you.... First
Up: Get something real to write about. The yarn
of a thief making good by one racecourse win is
neither probable nor edifying. .. .Mac: Doesn’t strike
us. .. .Augustus W.: You say, “I ben nearly 24 years
in Australia. I would never have never have landed
her if I had known there were such peracites her.
The poetry explains.” We will let some of it make
the attempt, Gus: —
Ansae Ansae is a glorious name
the deed we don brought no fame,
we fought like Barbarians wild and brave
like a black tribe of Savages we did behave
we tok no prisnors we slough them all
like true brave Ansacs the did fall,
we won the War, with fourteen Points
wich we distributed in Enemys minds
we made them believe we wher Sosialiste
that we wher fighting all Monarchists
the Revolution started amongst the Huns
we made them hand over all her guns.
Many deserted to our Ansae Line,
the wher all shot Byoneted, then buried in Lime
the wher kneeling and praying to let them live,
but bullets and byonets we them give.
...E.E.W.: Not our style... .J.J.M.: Doesn’t get near.
.... W.JS. (Concord) : Far too crude... .C.N.T.:
Sorry, but the verse is not nearly good enough....
L.S. (Cue): Not worth all that space.... Crab: The
unrelieved tale of death in the bush is about played
out.... Mary R.: Rather melodramatic... .P.8.P.:
Both miss.... Cape Weed: The Chinaman was
thrown qff the top of the coach, and preferred after-
wards to travel inside! Seems scarcely worth two
pages of rhyme... .H.T.R.: Not enough in the
swamp yam.. ..S.C. (Bellata) : They don’t get
near....B.W. (Kensington): The “Lover” doesn’t
thrill.... Mustapha: Goes a long way round to say
very little... G.A.L.: A sort of very rugged vaude-
ville song. No use here.. .H.A.P.: Commonplace of a
moderately virulent type... .Aready : Not up. .. .
A.J.8.: It’s wonderful how you could make even
the poorest material so du11.... Flicker: Don’t care
for “Peace”... .W.E.L.: Not quite... .Barrina: Both
fail.... Owen J.: Wants more skill in the telling...
Tom Hale: Too rugged.... S.Y. (Christchurch):
Poor stuff... .H.S.S.: You may have left “Dull Care
Behind,” but you evidently still cultivate dull verse.
....Clinton II.: Not enough there... .Fredk. F.: It
isn’t improved. There is far too much gravy for
the little bit of poorly-cooked meat.... Maurice:
Too thin..... J.L. (Adelaide): Nothing desirable
about the “Old Cat”... .A. 11.5.: Verses jolt and
matter is commonplace. .. .George R.: None of the
incidents has much point. .. .Adolf H.: No use....
C.M. (Moonee Ponds): Ancient tag to poor verse...
Uloola: It just says the usual thing and doesn’t
say it ' strikingly... .Bellerive: A fine sympathetic
little lyric:—
A once man of position,
Who’d descended the hill,
Through a stroke of misfortune,
Poor Bottle-o’ Bill.
To rob the vile tip—
He regardeth know sin,
When a bottle he finds
In a lane rubbish-bin.
Haggard and grey in
The prime of he’s life,
Scattered he’s children,
And dead he’s dear wife.
A once man of position,
Who’d descended the hill,
To suffer privations—
Poor Bottle-o’ Bill.
... .C.H.R.: It wanted very good verse to carry so
slight , a thing; and yours is only middling....
R.C. (Lindfield) : Not for us.... Coreen N.: Write
about something. .. .H.11.C.: The “Drover’s” drear.y
maunderings on two sides of the paper are rejected
with great enthusiasm... .C.W.W.W.: It’s all a
kind of selected commonplace without a hint of
feeling.... Spud: Crude and heavy.... Ecce: The
man who tries to rhyme “horde” with “awed” should
not be allowed the use of ears. .. .Lilian M.: Not up.
.. . .8.C.P.: Don’t like it. . . .8.W.R.: When a slab
of verse begins “Sweet Spring; we greet thee!” the
lines that follow would need to be more than good
to redeem it. Yours are only a little less than bad.
.... Mary M.: It’s in the right direction... Tara-
wab: Poor and thin.... Kat: That’s the stuff ,o stir
them out of the swamp:—
Crusaders are wanted to lift Australia
Clear from the rank bog failture.
Australia’s young back is none too strong!
Though gamely an overburden it carried long.
Crusaders. Who will follow the road advancement,
And keep to the left the sickening swamps of gloom.
And watch for the finger-post betterment
That point the way to a sweeter bloom.
Stawlants, that will cast aside, with willing arms 1
Obnoxious growths and false alarms !
That will choke the life from a young Nation !
When the seeds spout a bitter agitation.
....Jay M.: Not much of a yarn; and we “regis-
tered” some disgust at the language, which is that of
aged Cockney tales.... 5.0. L.: There is no excuse
for writing on two sides of the paper, even if the
yarn is badly t01d... .W.J.K.: Once or twice every
week we are offered verses headed “Wanderlust”;
and experience shows that the German brand is a
guarantee of poor stuff... .L.G.D.: It has some of
the worst lines we have ever met in an attempt at
a sonnet... .N.Q.11.: Not a spark of feeling nor a
touch of freshness in it....Gaymask: Not well enough
done... .H.P.C.: Catalogue of all the things done by
“Harbor Clouds” failed to make us wildly excited.

“Invalid”: John Huss and Servetus had
pleasant deaths compared to some of
the sheep sent to Newmarket in certain
trucks provided by the Victorian Railway
Department. These trucks are open, and
are made wholly of iron. They are mostly
used for wheat, and are all right for sheep
if the weather remains cool, but if they
stand for any length of time in a hot sun
it is impossible for a man to keep his hand
on them. People who truck sheep in such
receptacles in summer-time deserve to be
fried over a slow fire themselves.
“B.”: South Australians may soon have
their groceries weighed out by assistants
with letters after their names. The Fed-
erated Retail Grocers’ Association, at their
last conference in Brisbane, advocated tech-
nical education for grocers’ apprentices. Now
the S. Aus. branch has induced the Adelaide
School of Mines to establish a special class
for the instruction of seniors and juniors in
the grocery trade. The first term begins in
1923, and numerous intending students have
sent in their names. The Institute of Certi-
ficated Grocers, London, endorses the scheme,
and says that if the S.A. students desire, they
can sit for the Institute examinations and
diploma. To become an F.G.I. (Fellow of
the Grocery Institute), a sound knowledge cf
foodstuffs must be gained.
***■»{■
“Stellsby”: Melbourne M.B.W. certainly
looks ahead, if politicians don’t. In view of
the fact that posterity has justifiable claims
to good health, the Board has recommended
that it be granted power to reserve the huge
Baw Baw plateau of 37,000 acres for water
conservation. In 40 years’ time it is esti-
mated that this extra source of supply will
be fully utilised. But the Melbourne sewer-
age question demands prevision, too. The
system can only carry to capacity and no
more.
“Azrim”: Apropos chewing the leaves of
Erythroxylon coca (B. 9/11/’22). The
Peruvians, who originated the practice, wrap
the drug around lime and chew it as the
eastern nigger does betel-nut. There is a
tradition that the user never experiences
fatigue ; but this, of course, is pure bunkum.
The coca fiend undoubtedly requires less food
and can go, apparently without harm, for a
couple of days without sleep. The explana-
tion is that cocaine is a powerful nervine
stimulant, and also exercises an anaesthetic
effect upon the stomach. But the change is
only transitory, and the last state of the man
who benefits by it is many times worse than
the first.
' * » • ’
“Cruma”: The houses mentioned by
“T.R.H.” (B. 26/10,/’22) which were brought
out in sections from England in the early
days and assembled here were, many of them,
specially advertised as “Residences for the
Colonies” at the Crystal Palace Exhibition
of 1852. Four were brought out and erected
at Hunter’s Ilill by one Leonardo Etienne
Bordier. Three of them are still standing;
one of these is the actual building erected for
show purposes in the Exhibition grounds in
’52. It was occupied for many years by my
grandfather and his family, and the original
design is still unaltered.
* * * *
“Dash Dotty”: Since the electric trains
have been running to Flemington Race-
course the Telegraph Department has had
trouble with its underground cables buried
in the vicinity. One cable lasted only three
months, and on the morning of several im-
portant race meetings telegraph and tele-
phone lines to the course have been found to
be faulty, although they tested O.K. on the
previous day. On one occasion the common
“earth” wire was corroded right away.
Electrolysis, or stray electricity from the
heavy railway current, is blamed, the vag-
rant “juice” choosing the return path of
least resistance —in this case, the lead-
sheatlied cable. It is alleged that, around
Newport, sufficient stray current can be
collected from the gas- and water-pipes to
violently agitate a galvanometer needle.
The estimated wheat harvest, still the
main interest of S.A., has been reduced
from 14 to 11 bushels, which is a bit better
than last year and about the average. The
figures are pulled down by recent farming-
advances in the comparatively poor West
Coast, and a really bad failure in the country
behind Port Lincoln. The total expectation
is over 20 million bushels, with 21 available
for export. Besides this, an unusual lot of
wheaten hay is being cut.
* * * *
“Melrose”: “Splinter” (B. 2/11/’22), if
he troubled to investigate, would find most
Q. farmers agree that cotton-seed should be
planted from to 3 inches in depth, 101 b.
to be allowed to the acre. Planting time is
from the beginning of September till the
end of November. The Government’s refusal
to have anything to do with ratoon cotton
will mean the ruin of many new farmers.
They bought their farms, chiefly on the ex-
pectation of a good crop from the ratoon
cotton fields, and it is too late for them to
get the plants out and the land planted again.
As there has been very little rain in districts
like the Dawson Valley, there is little like-
lihood of a large cotton crop this season.
“U.P.”: If the Japs don’t presently add
primary production to their manufacturing
activities it won’t be Australia’s fault. For
some years now they have been purchasing
stud sheep from the Commonwealth, and
recently an application from a Japanese
came before the Council of the Agricultural
Exhibition. He is a student at Gatton Col-
lege, Queensland, and asked to enter Dookie
to study sheep-breeding and wool-classing.
The reply was, in effect, “By all means!
Come right in, and we’ll teach you all we
know.”
* * • •
“Hambone”: Add another baby to the
growing list of industries tackled by Aus-
tralians. A Sydney company is shortly to
commence the production of pigment paint
at Port Waratah (N.S.W.), using the
hitherto waste liquid of sulphate of iron left
in the sulphuric-acid bath at Rylands’ plant
after iron rods have been cleaned. The co.
will have to oust the Spanish producers who
have had a thumbscrew on the local market
before they begin to export.

Although in Australia but a comparatively
short time,Skalski’s genius has speedily
gained him recognition as a virtuoso of high
calibre. His conductorship of the late State
Conservatorium Orchestra was that of a mas-
ter of performance as well as that of knowledge.
As a pianist whose reputation is better known
in the old-world musical centres than even
it is here, his opinion of the New Beale is
authoritative.

all the attributes of the ideal

months I have been playing
two of your small grands —
one in my home and one in

have responded perfectly to
my work. I find the tone rich
and full and of striking 'vol-

has pleased me very much-
permitting of great dynamic

“Footslogger”: Recent mention of Peter
Lalor’s medical grandson (B. 23/11/’22)
recalls another grandson who was killed on
Gallipoli—'Captain J. P. Lalor. At various
periods he w r as in the Royal Navy, the
French Foreign Legion, and a revolution in
South America. Until shortly before he died
he carried a family sword, regulations not-
withstanding. Bean’s history records that
the sword was later picked up by Sergt.
Freame, who in turn dropped it owing to
stress of fighting. I wonder what became of
that old carving-knife?
“Lexite”: .Tack Higgins, M.L.C., who
has just thrust another weekly gossip-sheet,
the Tattler, upon the somewhat congested
Sydney market, was once associated with W.
A. Woods in the management of the Hobart
Labor paper. Then he did some bluey-
humping, and eventually landed into a job
on the Sydney Worker. He left that to
take charge of the Labor News, which
originated, allegedly, from a desire on the
part of the city unionists to have a paper
of their own. The desire was backed with
such a paucity of cash and support, that
Higgins began to suspect that the News
was merely another of the things Jock Gar-
den and his friends said the city unionists
wanted. And so he got out. He is one
of the Labor M’s.L.C. who were created to
destroy themselves, and didn’t do it; has
been a member of the A.L.P. executive for
years; and is usually relied upon in the
drafting of manifestos.
“E.S.”: The local land-monopolist was
mentioned when Bill Massey went to Puke-
kohe (M.L.) to open his election campaign.
“He’s holding 72 acres—holding it against
settlement and blocking the progress of the
district,” said the spokesman of an informal
deputation. The land in question is part of
Pukekohe hill, where five acres are a farm
and ten a fortune. I met a man there who,
from an area of rather less than five acres,
got two crops of potatoes, ten tons to the
acre, worth about £l2 a ton when sold “new”
in the Auckland and Wellington markets.
Onions and green peas come off the hill, but
the staple product is the potato. Perhaps
that is because the original Pukekohe settlers,
60 or 70 years ago, came from the South
of Ireland. A shipload of Ulster folk occu-
pied another hill, about three miles away,
and the two settlements shared a market
township. They used to break heads on
market days. Massey belongs to an Ulster
family, and his opporer.t at election-time can
always get some v s ;ii Pukekohe.
“Howitzer” : T>t> ‘ get-rich-quick” Jacks,
on the A.P.M. staff, start.''ci ri paying little
“coin foundry” at Tidworth Headquarters in
1917. One was a forger of experience, and
his assistant was a master of engraving.
By changing the notes of newcomers, and
supplying change in brummy coin to various
crown-and-anchor joints, they soon worked up
a good connection. The imitation florins
were excellent, and the pair might have come
through without detection but for their greed
in trying to unload a £5O parcel of coin on
their own Headquarters. The affair was
kept very dark, and the two Jacks were
lucky enough to escape with a year apiece.
The sixth Earl Spencer, who recently died
at the age of 65, was before his succession to
the title Bobby Spencer, the immaculate young
man of fashion who convulsed the House of
Commons by informing it that he was “not an
agricultural laborer.” His was the wearying
task of “whipping” the Liberals whilst they
wandered in the wilderness, and no one
better suited for the job than this apparent
social butterfly could have been chosen. He
was a great personal friend of the late
Edward VII., and became Lord Chamberlain
after filling various household appointments.
“D. Jay” (Thursday Island) : I don’t
w r onder that “Bouragi” (B. 12/10/’22) is
sceptical about “C. Coral’s” new diving-
apparatus. I was; but I saw the stunt
myself. The Jap went down 43 fathoms
(measured) and brought up a shell. He
was down 15 minutes, and yvas hauled to
the surface again in three minutes. He
wore a calico suit and flannel shirt, with a
towel round the top of his head, a pair of
Jap shoes, and a cord with 201 b. of lead
round his waist. The stunt was a demon-
stration to the white pearlers of Thursday
Island. It looks as if the theories as to
the pressure of the sea want revising; and
it must not be forgotten that the ordinary
diver has to stand a very severe pressure
from the air which is pumped into his dress.
This Jap seemed to feel no inconvenience.
But I see two important objections to the
new contraption. The man must be wet
from the moment he enters the water, and
without the protection of the dress he might
easily form a tempting meal for some hungry
shark.
McEwan Hunter, returning to Queens-
land from London, told Adelaide inter-
viewers that his health had greatly improved
since he handed over the Agency-General to
Fihelly. As for trade :
Australian manufactured goods are not popular
in England. They are not attractively packed, while
in some cases best-quality goods are not sent.
During the war, inspectors were not strict in re-
gard to the goods they passed. Australian manu-
facturers must awake to the fact that those days
are past; nothing but the best will now. be accepted.
In raw products Australia can hold her own with
the world, but is handicapped by distance, com-
pared with Canada, South Africa and the. Argentine.
It is vitally necessary to have closer co-operation
between our vendors in regard to the marketing
of their goods.
“O’D.” Cotton threatens to rob N.S.W. of
a few more of her settlers. It would seem
to be a case of “go where the land is easiest
acquired.” Years ago there was a trek of
dairy-farmers from the South Coast of Noo
South to the Northern Rivers areas along
the Richmond and the Tweed. Dairying
land in the new tract of country increased
in value, so, when dad could not afford to
set them up there, Dave and Kate and the
others made for the Atherton scrub in
Bananaland, and cleared cow r pastures on
their own account. Now the Tweed set-
tlers are again hearing the North a-callin’.
This time it is the Dawson Valley, wffth its
cotton prospects, that is the lure.
“Pro”: Most of the egg preservers who
have prescribed concoctions in the discussion
upon this subject, are safe in backing their
fancy. Any old medium (grease or solution)
will do the embalming trick, provided that
it seals the porous shell, making it air-
tight without impregnating the contents.

Young'
N.S. 63
at Sixty!
You’ve met jolly old
couples like this yourself.
They’re hale and hearty,
rosy cheeked, eyes bright
with twinkling kindli-
ness. A cheery word for
everyone, the friends and
confidants of all they
come in contact with.
Why? Why are they
different from others of
like age? Why are they
active and cheery when
other old folks are
crippled by rheumatism
and gout, old in manner
and outlook?
Simply because they are
healthy.
It is the same with young
and old alike. If you are
healthy you have the nor-
mal, healthy outlook of
cheeriness on life. But
keeping in the pink of
health under modern con-
ditions of life requires
care on your part.
Just consider these facts:
most of us get insufficient
fresh air and not nearly
enough active exercise.
Added to this there are
the errors of diet, over
work, nervous strain,
anxiety which are insepar-
able from modern life. All
these conditions affect the
system; the liver and kid-
neys are especially sensi-
tive, and as a direct result
they fail to perform their
functions actively enough.
This causes impurities to
creep into the blood.
Headaches, tiredness,
slackness, sleepiness after
meals, depression, rheu-
matism, and other ills
follow.
Kruschen Salts should
be your safeguard. Every
morning put as much as
will cover a sixpence in
your breakfast cup of tea.
They are tasteless if taken
this way.
Kruschen Salts tone up
liver and kidneys so that
the organs begin again to
perform their functions
actively, thoroughly. Re-
stored to full efficiency,
these organs do the work
which Nature intends;
they eliminate impurities
from the blood. Clear,
refreshed blood courses
tingling to every fibre of
the body, bringing new
life, new health and new
vigor to your whole sys-
tem.
Tasteless in Tea
Put as much in each
breakfast cup as will lie
on a sixpence. It’s the
little daily dose that does
Kjjts
The dose of a sixpenceful taken
every morning is found in practice
to be just the right amount for a
most invigorating daily tonic. The
medicinal dose for persons suffer-
ing from pains of Rheumatism and
Gout or habitual Constipation, with
Good health for a farthing a day.

Be a Rexona Girl!
It Means Health and Beauty.
Miss Gwen Foot, the charming
young dancer who recently appeared
in “Cairo,” at Her Majesty’s Theatre,
Sydney, is a Real Rexona Girl, and
writes us as follows: —
“I think there is nothing like
Rexona Soap for the hair. No other
soap does for my skin what Rexona
Scap will; it keeps it so soft and
lovely. Once a week 1 always sham-
poo my hair with Rexona Soap, and
find there is nothing its equal for
keeping the hair in perfect condition*
“(Sgd.) GWEN FOOT,
“9 Kellett Street,
“Darlinghurst, N.S.W.”
Rexona Soap—
The Aristocrat of Soaps.
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap will do
more to improve your skin than you
ever thought a soap could do. It is
medicated on the same principle as the
famous Rexona Ointment. Thus it is
able to exert the hygienic effects of
Rexona upon the skin with every
cleansing operation. Prevents rough-
ness, beautifies complexions, soothes
tender skin, protects from infection
and disease, unexcelled for shampooing,
purifies the scalp, removes dandruff, and
brings health to the hair.
Rexona Soap, 1/- per Tablet.

by keeping your whole system in proper working order. With

Reg. L. (“Snowy”) Baker can help you to a full realisation of
the joy of life if you take up his
Postal Course of Health and
Strength Culture.
It is emphatically not a “strong-man” course, but a
series of simple, enjoyable, graduated exercises that will
bring into play the neglected muscles, steady the nerves,
help you to breathe and develop properly, and make all
the organs of the body perform their functions correctly.
No apparatus is required, and each lesson is graded to
suit particular individual requirements.
“Snowy” Baker has written a most interesting booklet,
“Health and Strength from Self-culture,” which tells
all about the course, and contains many valuable hints.

the book will be forwarded.

He ,t“ tie duet in a Quest relentless
Through the haze wherein his fate
And the I( gl'ass is dead, and the scrub is
Where* 3 the old prospector seeks for gold.
A lean tough man and a steady graftei,
He seldom travels with thoughtless haste—
An old spring dray with its old bay shatter
To haul him over the trackless waste
His keen eyes yearn for the voiceless dis-
tanoe
That veils the ridge as with grey remorse,
And seems to offer a fierce resistance
To the slow advance of his old bay horse.
In times of stress, when tjie noontide blazes,
He makes his camp by the gnamma holes
The wild dog howls through the night and
Witlf greedy eyes at his camp-fire coals.
He scales a peak which the flame-wind sullies
In climes where the clear sky seldom
grieves;
Where jasper gleams in the stony gullies,
And outcrops flash through the mulga
leaves.
As the morn-sun rises full and jolly,
And shouts a greeting to rock and leal.
With pick and hammer and dish and dolly
He tests the cap of a likely reef.
He toils and fossicks and soon discloses
A run of wash in a dry creek-bed,
Where many a weighty slug reposes
Till news of his rich reward has spread.
And after the find has been reported,
When men have swarmed on the peggecl-
out ground—
Ere an ounce of gold has been escorted—
The man and his horse they can t be
found. , , . , ■,
They trek far out o’er the heights and
hollows
For likely spots on the sand-waste brown ;
They leave the wealth for the crowd that
follows
To stir the pulse of a canvas town.
By vast, white lakes the mirage still dances;
The saltbush gleams on the treeless plain,
And spinifex lifts its pointed lances
To a sky that sheds no balm of ram.
He dwells'in that dreadful silence, seeking
Fresh fields for a loud promoter’s score —
When he hears the voices of riches speaking,
He drifts away to the scrub once more.
Unheard, unseen, by the world forgotten,
For long spells numbered among the dead,
Where the bones of the vanguard lost lie
rotten,
He still strives hard for the hills ahead.
And who remembers the wealth long buried,
His pick revealed on a scourging quest
That ended not when the mainguard hurried
To break the reefs of the virgin wrnst?
Behind him cities have bloomed and wilted,
Fair streets are built on his camping-
ground—
By luck forsaken, by fortune jilted,
He parted soon with the gold he d found.
Tall spires and homes of the proud and
settled,
The hum of life and of joy no lack
Are heard on the highways newly-metalled
By all but the man who blazed the track.
Behind him far, like incessant breakers
That storm the verge of a rock-bound
shore,
The stampers crash, where the loaded
shakers
The dish and dolly are seen no more.
He leaves the crowd to its comforts clinging,
Its trams and trains and its costly cars,
And drinks no more to the aimless ringing
Of greedy tills in the crowded bars.
And far, far out, lured on by the gleams of
A quartzite cliff or a distant lake,
All day he moves and at night he dreams ot
The last big rise that he hopes to make.
These mark the wake of his course un-
veering : .
The dusty track and the wmyside pub.
The broken camp in the haunted clearing,
The lonely grave in the mulga scrub.
And we who him scarce remember —
Just pay him toll with a rhyme or rune—
Nor follow his march in fierce December.
Nor freeze with him in the month of June,
For aged he is and his wealth lies hidden
Beyond the haze where his fate is scrolled;
Little he knows of the fruits forbidden,
But beyond and beyond perchance is gold !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A T the back a tin fence and a narrow
/-% passage separated one shop from the
Qther _ Upstairs the two places ad-
joined. Looking from the side window of
the china shop one could catch glimpses of
the exciting life that went on in the kitchen
of the cheap restaurant next door. Just
glimpses, no more; incidents without begin-
ning or end, cut off sharply like a break in a
cinematograph film. The flash °f a l ?ni f e
an arm upraised to ward off a blow. . • •
the dark, scowling face of the Dago cook
framed for a moment in the window.. . .the
pretty, supercilious waitress with her an ot
insolent scorn for the kitchen menials as she
shouted her orders : .
“Roast beef, one; Steak and kidney pie,
one; Irish stew, two.”
By long association the girl in the cnina
shop knew them all. A dozen times a da>,
when the crates from overseas had been un-
packed, she climbed the dusty stairs with a
heavy basket of crockery to be stored in the
rooms above. It was arduous work, but she
preferred it to the interminable dusting in
the shop and the dreariness of serving cus-
tomers. By constant practice she had gained
such celerity in packing goods away that she
could quite easily spare a few minutes after
each trip to watch the exhilarating, feverish,
bustling life in the restaurant below without
her movements being called into question.
Sometimes the side door was left open and
then she could see through into the'restaurant
itself. This was like looking into another
world, and, to the girl above, it had the fas-
cination of the unusual and unknown. The
atmosphere was always thick and steamy,
and the foreheads of those who ate there gradu-
ally became covered with tiny beads of sweat.
Even the faces of the waitresses, thickly
powdered though they were, glistened with
the heat. The tables were covered with
dirty cloths, carelessly thrown on, splashed
with gravy and greasy with the marks left
by innumerable plates. In the centre of each
stood a vase of fly-speckled paper-flowers,
which had long outlived their period of
decoration, a tarnished cruet and a bottle of
tomato-sauce. At every table, wedged in so
closely that their elbows touched, were men.
Men with their jaws munching, men talking,
men reading, men drinking. Everywhere
men.
Amongst these men the pretty waitress lost
her supercilious manner. Her face, with
its innocent, wide-eyed stare, became wisttul,
almost appealing. The air she assumed of
the lamb lost in a den of lions appealed to
the instinctive chivalry of the male, or at
least to those males who were young enough
to be romantic, and those who were old
enough to be sentimental. The others were
merely indifferent. This mannerism, care-
fully acquired, brought her in many tips
which she hid furtively in the bosom of her
dress and sometimes down her stocking. Tips
were not the perquisites of the waitresses
but of the fat proprietor who sat in the
cash-desk near the door, his black, beady
eyes watchful, and the tip of his tongue con-
tinually moistening his thick, red lips. But
the money was only his if he chanced to see
it first. Whatever he might claim from the
other girls he very seldom succeeded in col-
lecting any spoils from the pretty waitress.
Her innocent manner baffled even him.
For a brief time in the afternoon the res-
taurant sank into silence, but after an hour
or so it awoke into clamor again. The
tables had to be re-set, more food cooked,
more hungry men fed. As the waitresses
went about their work, their strident voices
shrilling through the air, the girl next door
envied them their unceasing activity. They
had no time to think, no time to count the
years they had spent in bondage, no
time to dread the years they would
have to spend in bondage, unless some-
thing happened to take them out of it.
The only thing, of course, was marriage, and
she could not count on that. Her pale face
and quiet manner did not attract men.
There were always young men waiting to
take the other girls home on Fridays, but
there was never anyone for her. As she un-
packed the china from the crates in the shed
at the back of the shop she had moods of
furious rebellion, alternating with sullen,
resignation. What was the use of worry-
ing? Nothing would ever happen to her.
She would just go on, year after year, dust-
ing, serving, unpacking china out of crates,
packing it again into bins, and watching
life through the dirty pane of an upstairs
window. Yet she would sooner do that than
marry any of those young men who waited
for the girls round the corner. She hated
their pale, pimply faces, sleek, oily hair and
glib manners. If she could not have the kind
of man she wanted she would sooner live
alone.
It was strange that she should really like
unpacking crates. No one else did. She
always opened them with a sense of unex-
plained adventure, especially those from
China or Japan. As she handled the fragile
pieces, so fragile that they would snap in
your hand unless you were careful —and that
was a nuisance, because you had to pay for
breakages—she had the queerest thoughts and
experienced the strongest sense of divorcement
from real life. Those queer thoughts became
pictures in her mind —great masses of wis-
taria overhanging low bridges—cherry-trees
in bloom —temples set on windy hills —the
god in the forest....
Yet she never ceased working, putting the
china methodically in neat little rows on the
table; cups together, saucers together, plates
together. Fragile, brightly-colored pieces,
red, blue and gold, with funny little pictures.
Funny little animals with staring eyes;
funny little people in kimonos; funny little
women with high-dressed hair, bowing, danc-
ing, posing with fans. What were they ?
Geisha girls! Yes, that was right. Happy,
happy little Geishas, smiling, flirting, drink- ,
ing tea in shining rooms full of color and
light. Happy, happy Geisha girls.
She had been busy all the morning. One
crate, already unpacked, stood ready for mov-
ing at the back of the shed, and she was half
through another when a sudden sound brought
her back with a jerk from the world of
dreams in which she had been living. She
looked up sharply, then moved slightly so
that she was hfdden from sight. A man was
peering over the fence that separated one
shop from the other. She had a moment’s
impression of a hard, brown face with start-
lingly blue eyes before he drew himself level
with' the top of the fence and vaulted lightly
over. It was a clean jump, beautifully done,
and she gave an involuntary gasp of admira-
tion. None of those pimply-faced youths
could have done it, she thought.
He wheeled quickly and saw her. His
face hardened and his blue eyes narrowed
until they became mere slits in his brown
face.
“Don’t make a sound,” he muttered, mov-
ing towards her. “I won’t hurt you. But
if you do” He raised his hand threaten-
ingly.
She felt no fear of him in spite of his
threats; she was only conscious of an ever-
growing sense of lawless excitement.
“What is it?” she began in a whisper, his
stealthy manner affecting her. “Why”
She stopped suddenly as a terrific clamor
broke out next door. Shrieks, oaths, voices
shouting for the police, heavy footsteps run-
ning down the side passage, and the creak of
the back gate as it was flung open.
“The johns !” He looked quickly to right
and left," searching a way of escape. “If they
catch me I’m done. I can’t get out the back.
They’re watching the lane.”
“The window !” She had suddenly real-
ised they might be overlooked from above.
“Quick! They will see you.” As she spoke

Stop That Nagging Backache

tails a Story
Is a dull, nagging backache making you miserable? Do
sharp, knife-like pains go through you at every sudden
move? Do you feel weak, tired, all worn-out —as if
you just can’t keep going? It’s time, then, you found
out the cause of the trouble and made some effort to
correct it. Quite likely it’s your kidneys. A cold,
strain or overwork has probably weakened the kidneys,
and that is why you suffer that dull, depressing back-
ache and those sudden, stabbing pains. You may have
daily headaches, too, with spells of dizziness and some
annoying kidney irregularity. Don’t wait until serious
or chronic kidney disease sets in. Get back your health
while you can. Use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
Doan’s have helped scores of Sydney folks. They
should help you. Ask your neighbor.
INTERESTING SYDNEY EVIDENCE.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. E. Mayhew, 48 Alexander Street, Alexandria, Sydney, says“l suffered
from backache and rheumatic pains all over my body, and was sometimes so bad
that I was almost crippled. I could not stoop without enduring torture; in fact,
every movement meant increased suffering, and I often used to feel quite knocked
up. To make matters worse, my rest at night was disturbed and I was also
subject to dizzy attacks. One day a friend beard Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
very well spoken of, so she advised me to try them. I bought a bottle without
delay, and after taking them for a few days my health began to improve, so I
persevered, and by the time I had used three bottles I was cured. The backache
and rheumatism have gone completely, and I feel splendid in every way.”
Four years later Mayhew says:—“Since giving my testimony for Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills I have had a slight return of kidney trouble, but I again
used this fine remedy and it soon fixed me up. I strongly recommend Doan’s Pills
to all who suffer with their kidneys.”
A MAN’S CASE,
Mr. Jas. Wilson, 17 Little Buckingham Street, Sydney, says: —“For a long
time I suffered torture from backache and kidney trouble. The pains in my back
were very severe, and I have been so bad that I could not attend to my work, as
every movement caused positive torture. The kidney secretions were affected,
being thick and clpudy and containing a red sediment. I was also subject to
dizzy feelings and could not sleeo properly at night. Nothing I took gave me
any permanent relief, but one day, when I was feeling very bad, I heard good
reports of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so I sent for some, and after taking
seven bottles I was cured. This remedy not only banished the backache, but
strengthened and toned up my kidneys and improved my general health.”
Mr. Wilson confirms the above eight years later, and says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and always have a bottle in the
house. By taking them every now and again my kidneys keep in a healthy state,
and I am never troubled wfith backache.”

she drew him behind the door. They stood
close together, their bodies touching, speak-
ing in breathless whispers. Her heart
pounded in her throat, and she caught the
edge of the table to steady herself.
“What did you do?” Not that it mat-
tered. She did not care what he had done.
“Robbed the till.” He jerked his head and
his lips curved into a grin. “That fat cow !
I’ve always had it in for him.”
So had she. She hated the fat proprietor
with his thick, red lips and his dark, oily
skin. She was glad, glad he had been robbed.
She hated him the more because he meant
danger to this man. Somehow she must save
him. She must! She could not bear to
think of him in gaol.
“Are you going to help me, kid?”
She could feel his breath on her cheek and
see the extreme blueness of his eyes. He
knew she -would help him. Oh, he knew it!
They were searching the place next door.
She could hear them at it. Running upstairs,
dashing through the restaurant, looking for
the thief. No, lie was not a thief, this man
with the brown face and blue eyes, lie was
an adventurer—what did they call it?- —a buc-
caneer. Yes, that was it. She must save
him if she could. Men were standing out in
the lane. Above the fence she caught the
glint of a policeman’s helmet. It would have
to be done at once, but where could she hide
him? She looked round desperately, then her
eyes fell on the empty crate.
“Quick!” she whispered.
lie caught her meaning at once. Silently
as a cat he stole across the shed and climbed
into the crate. He crouched down and she
covered him lightly with straw, then clamped
on the lid. It was done, and for the moment
he was safe.
When the policeman came through she was
carefully unpacking china, a slight figure
dressed in black with a pale face and dark,
dilated eyes.
She knew him well by sight. She had seen
him on point duty, and with his children in
the little side street where he lived. A slow-
moving, easy-going man with a hatred of
exertion, she gained hope as she looked at
him. It would be easy enough to deceive
him.
“Seen anyone, missie?”
She shook her head. “No, but I heard the
noise.”
“Umph!” He looked round reflectively.
“Been here all the time?”
“Since 12 o’clock. I’ve been unpacking.”
“Not left the shed at all?”
“No.”
He tilted back his helmet and scratched
his head, then his eyes fell on the crate.
“What’s in here?”
“Just china.” No one would have guessed
from the calmness of her voice the agony
of mind she was suffering. “I have to un-
pack that when I’ve finished the one I’m
doing now.”
“You’re sure, missie, that no one came
through here?”
“No. I would have been frightened if I
had seen anyone.”
Her artless air was convincing. “But I
remember now that just before the noise
started I heard the back gate slam next
door.”
“Oh, did you? Why didn’t you say that
before? I guess he must have made oil down
the lane.”
He moved away and she bent over her
work again. She dared not risk speaking to
him yet, though she was in a fever of im-
patience. At any moment the storeman
might come in. He would know the crate
was empty. He might even attempt to move
it, for they sold as quickly as they were
emptied. Next door the noise had died
down. Evidently they had realised he was
not there. Half-an-hour passed and she
could bear it no longer. Heckless of the
consequences she ran to the back gate and
looked up and down the lane. There was no
one about, even the policemen had gone. He
must go’ now. It was dangerous to stay any
longer. He must take his chance.
Casting a hasty glance round she unlocked
the lid and raised it. “Quickly!” she whis-
pered. “I’m afraid to keep you any longer.
The storeman comes in at live and he might
find you. Go down the lane. I’ve just
looked and there’s no one about.”
"I’ll risk it.” He stood up. There were
wisps of straw in his hair and in his clothes.
She brushed them _off.
“Now go,” she said.
Their eyes met and a sudden light flamed
into his. He took her roughly in his arms.
“By God, kid, you're game! If I get
through”
“Oh, go, go,” she cried, in an agony.
“Don’t let them get you now.”
“Kiss me,” he commanded.
The hard grasp of his hands hurt her arms,
but she did not flinch. Their lips met. She
could not refuse him; she could not have
refused him anything.
“Don’t forget,” he said. “You’re —mine.
I’ll come back.”
He held her for a moment longer, then
released her. She heard his light footsteps
running down the passage, and fell on her
knees, hiding her face in her hands. Five
minutes or so she waited in an agony, but
heard no further sound. He must have got
through the lane by this time and into the
crowded streets, where he would have more
chance. He must have escaped. If they
had caught him she would have heard some-
thing. It was all over. Still trembling
slightly she got up, gathered the straw to-
gether and put it in the crate, then went
back to her work.
She had just finished and was packing the
china into a basket ready to take upstairs
when one of the girls from the shop came
out. She swung herself on to the table, her
face flushed with excitement.
“Did you hear all the row?” She did not
wait for an answer, but gabbled on. “Great
fun, wasn’t it? I’m glad they grabbed him
after all. They say he was just turning out
of the lane into High-street, when they
etui."lit him.”
“They—caught—him !” The cup she was
holding snapped between her fingers.
“Yes, jolly good job I call it. I say, look
what you’ve done. You’ll get into trouble.
Here, sling it away and don’t say anything
about it.”
“It doesn’t matter.” Her voice sounded
dull and tired. “I can pay for it, I sup-
pose.” With careful nrecision she stacked
a row of cups in the basket. “It must be
rather —terrible in gaol,” she went on, after
a pause, during which the other girl swung
her legs, and watched her. "Lonely, too.
But I suppose his friends could go and see
him? In gaol, I mean?”
"Eh?” The other looked at her blankly.
“Yes, I think so. Why?”
"Oh, nothing.”
She bent over her work again.
CAPEL BOAKE.
The Accident.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PARKINSON was passionately devoted
to his wife, who fully returned his
affection, and this night he made for
home with gladness in his step, because of
the bracelet which a special bit of luck had
enabled him to purchase. It was a trinket
she had wistfully admired in a jeweller’s
window only a week before, and Parkinson,
as lie walked, was lost to his surroundings
in anticipation of the surprise it was
going to mean to her.
He woke from his abstraction sharply at
a sudden tumult of shouts as he was crossing
Pitt-street. A tram was charging down on
him, and he had hastened to avoid it before
he noticed two motor-cars speeding abreast
on the other side. To stand still meant
annihilation by the tram, to check himself
and spring backward was likewise impossible,
and it seemed equally impossible to avoid
the oncoming cars. All this flashed upon
him in one nightmare moment; then he leapt
forward, taking what appeared to be the least
appalling risk.
Trembling and shaken, he realised with
amazement that he had escaped. Dizzily he
watched the rush of people from all direc-
tions into the middle of the street, and it
dawned upon him that there had been an
accident —probably caused by the efforts of
the car-drivers to avoid running him down.
Yet he felt too sick to investigate, and moved
away. A curious nausea assailed him as he
thought that he, himself, might be lying
there in the street, the life crushed out of
him; and the wife he loved might wait
wonderingly for his return until the grue-
some news was brought to her. He visioned
himself as actually dead, and found himself
wondering whether consciousness would cease
abruptly, or whether the impulses of
thought would move onward in dream-action
as real to the dreamer as actuality. What
was actuality, anyway?
It seemed to him that his thoughts had
reached the brink of an abyss filled with
black mists of confusion; and from thedizzi-
ness of further thinking he checked himself
with an effort. Yet the same thoughts re-
turned often in subsequent days, always
bringing with them a vague bewilderment.
“That narrow shave has upset me,” he
would mutter. “I must try to put it out
of my mind.”
But his escape had made another differ-
ence, which he noted sometimes with amaze-
ment. He put it down to the shock of
thinking of his wife as a grief-stricken
widow, and the effect it had had on n ■
mind. He had been, before, a iond, well-in-
tentioned husband, whose intentions wei
astray very often; but now all the 01 a
carelessness had gone. He had no longer
a weakness for lingering with friends, nut
always hurried home after the daily routine
of his work. And his business went with
a curious smoothness. Matters he had
planned in an abstract fashion, happily
ignoring the difficulties but hardly hoping
for actual success, he now carried through
triumphantly. The uncanny way the
obstacles vanished had in it a nightmarish
touch. Wealth came to him. feoon lie
was able to plan out that bungalow it had
been his life’s dream to buy his wife; and
he actually did one evening drive home his
own motor-car. .
There was happiness, of course, m the
realisation of these long-cherished dreams;
but it was saddened by a strange feeling
of separation from his wife. While he joy-
fully heaped luxuries upon her, and warmed
to the momentary gladness each of his
gifts brought her, he was aware that she
was fretting, as though continuously her
heart was yearning for something she had
not. And. strangely, he found it difficult
to speak to her about this phase, though
a hundred times he tried to do it.
Then she became ill, and with an ever-
growing weakness and indifference, she lay
in her bed and wept weakly. He would put
his arms around her, and with loving solici-
tude try to win back to normality her
stricken spirit; but always she appeared
to be oblivious of his presence. He became
desperate as he watched her wasting away.
* * * *
One afternoon as she lay with his arm
around her shoulder, in the last stage of her
weakness, a strange change came over her.
His glance had wandered through the win-
dow, out over the sunlit garden, and he
had sensed u joyous note of Spring in the
air—the hum of new-born life, the sweet
scent of awakened beauty. Then, turning
to her, he saw a swift ecstasy sweep away
the worn sadness of her face. And as he
looked into the eyes so suddenly starry, she
flung her arms about him in a passionate
embrace. Parkinson’s senses reeled under
the shock of delight, and he was but mistily
conscious when she rose from the bed, her
arms still linked around him....
The mists cleared and he found himself
in a radiant countryside, his wife, aglow
with happiness, beside him. He was still
trying to adjust himself to the sudden
transition when she said: “It’s glorious to
have you again !”
“Have me again?” he echoed wonderingly.
“I have wished for nothing but death
since that day you were killed in Pitt-
street,” she said.
For one amazed instant Parkinson was
at a loss; then he knew everything—and
the music of an eternal Spring was lilting
in his ears.
* * * *
“Poor soul!” said the nurse, reverentially
laying-out the body; “she died heart-broken
—and for a man who must have been a
waster. They say he was drunk on the day
he was killed.”
