Amundsen
ith the North Pole found one-and-a-
quarter times—giving Cook the benefit of the
ti action and the South Pole found twice,
bj Amundsen and, as we shall soon hear, by
Scott, the world will heave a typhoon of re-
lief, and get on with its work. Nobody else
can discover either Pole, though doubtless
' urious assorted maniacs will discover new
means of getting to the top storey and the
basement of the globe by motor-bike, aero-
plane, perambulator or ice-yacht, or by
waUdng backwards all the way, or holding
hill-climbing competitions in sprinting up
glaciers. A\ ith The South Pole, by Roald
Amundsen (two vols.; Murray, per Dymock’s
Library), and Scott’s future work, the big
book of Polar exploration may be consid-
ered closed.
Ihe South Pole is the stirring record of
a party of white men who put up no bluff
about scientific research” or “examination
ot meteorological conditions,” as is usual
in British expeditions out to bag the Pole
but went straight there and got back in
record time. It is true that Amundsen con-
cealed his intention of pocketing the South
hole till the last possible minute; it is true
that he gave out to the world that he was
aftei the North Pole, and informed Scott
on P at the same time as he informed his
crew of his change of plans. Exception can
be taken to this secrecy, but it is difficult to
see how Scott was handicapped by the pre-
sence of the Norwegian; and certainly Scott
made no change in his own plans on learning
of the start of his rival. And that rival
made no use of Scott’s and Shackleton’s pre-
vious explorations, leaving to Scott the route
lie and ; Shackleton had thoroughly explored
and striking out through unknown territory’
Indeed, Amundsen profited by Shackleton’s
mistakes, and staked his own judgment
against that of his predecessor as to the
deductions to be drawn from certain of
Shackleton’s observations.
Amundsen was a strategist, who had no
scruples about his rather “slim” action in
getting ahead of the franker, slower Scott:
Nor did I feel any great scruples with re-
gard to the other Antarctic expeditions that
were being planned at the time. I knew I
should be able to inform Captain Scott of
the. extension of my plans before he left
civilisation, and therefore a few months
sooner or later could be of no great import-
ance. Scott s plan and equipment were so
W 1 j j dilierent from my own that I re-
garded the telegram that I sent him later,
with the information that we were bound
tor the Antarctic regions, rather as a mark
ot courtesy than as a communication which
might cause him to alter his programme in
the slightest degree. The British expedition
was designed entirely for scientific research.
Ihe 1 ole was only a side-issue, whereas in
my extended plan it was the main object.
. . . .If at that juncture I had made my in-
tention public, it would only have given
occasion for a lot of newspaper discussion,
and possibly have ended in the project being
stifled at its birth. B
In Amundsen’s judgment, Shackleton
missed discovering the Pole by a hasty con-
clusion that the Barrier was afloat at the
Bay of Whales
*°, r wt L ftn Shackleton passed the Bay of
Whales in January, 1908, and saw the ice
in process of breaking up and
dritiing out, he had waited a few hours, or
the most a couple of days, the problem of
the Soiith Pole would probably have been
solved long before December, 1911. With
his keen sight and sound judgment, it would
not have taken him long to determine that
the inner part of the bav does not consist of
floating barrier, but that the Barrier there
rests upon a good, solid foundation, probably
in the form of small islands, skerries, or
shoals, and from this point he and his able
companions would have disposed of the
bouth Polar question once for all.
In this fine book Amundsen reveals him-
self as .a master of a lucid, straightforward
style, gifted with a sense of humor, and pos-
sessed of a genial, capable personality. He
got to the Pole by the expert knowledge and
practical acquaintance of Arctic conditions
inherent in Norwegians, by the expertness of
his party upon ski. by the intuitive know-
ledge. his party had of the best methods of
working and harnessing Esquimaux dogs,
and, above all, by a care in preparation of
material and methods that closelv ap-
proaches the well-known definition of genius.
Thus lig pinned his faith to dogs, as opposed
to the English explorers’ dependence on
Ponies. One important reason Was “that
dog can eat dog.” The methodical way in
which he slaughtered his dogs as he reached
certain predetermined latitudes will doubt-
less be objected to by the ladies who prefer
pet dogs to babies ; but the system of reduc-
ing his party by disposing of the dogs seems
to be better than that of sending back at
intervals supporting parties of men. And
Amundsen took his whole party to the Pole,
and insisted on every member helping to
unfurl the Norwegian flag on that desolate
plain. Peary, it will be remembered, re-
served that honor for a nigger and himself.
. The journey across the Equator in
his tiny ship, the Fram, every inch of the
deck of which was devoted to his
hundred dogs—l 6 of them had to be accom-
modated on the bridge—is almost as inter-
esting as his sledge journey to the Pole. It
was tile most dangerous section of his trip,
as, without the safe arrival of the dogs!
nothing could have been done. 1
Framheim. the winter quarters of the ex-
pedite at the Bay of Whales, developed
into a wonderful system of underground
dwellings hewn from th.e ice. The liut was
even provided with a system of ventilation.
Everywhere appear evidences of the invent-
iveness, the skill and the pluck of the mem-
bers of the party. They even rigged
up a vapor-bath in one of the un-
derground rooms. The winter was spent in
the most careful preparations for the great
adventure. The new system of marking out
depots by lines of sticks extending across,
and not along, the line of march, contrib-
uted materially to the party’s safe return.
In case the thermometers should be smashed
on the trip, Amundsen made each member
ot the winter-party guess the temperature
every morning, and found, as he expected,
that the average result of these guesses gave
him the mean temperature to within a frac-
tion of accuracy. But they broke no ther-
mometers.
Spring came, and with it the expedition,
always intent on beating Scott, made a false
start. The weather was still too cold. On
the second start the going was at first so
good that Amundsen made a rope fast to one
ot the sledges, and was pulled on his ski 340
mdes toward the Pole! Then, of course,
the difficulties began. His route was
marked by 150 snow beacons, each fur-
nished with indications of the whereabouts
ot the next —an exaggerated system of pre-
cautions, but, in this careful leader’s mind
an absolute necessity for their safe return.
>ut the chief feature of his achievement
was the value of ski to these men “born and
bred with ski on our feet.” The terrible
hardships of the ascent of one glacier, to be
followed by the necessity, for the ascent of
another before the final plateau was
reached, will engross any reader. The
account of the journey equals in narrative
quality and in thrilling interest that of
bhackleton’s return from farthest south—
and that is the highest possible praise.
Every step we now took in advance

And yet and yet....“ What on earth is
Uroa scenting?’ It was Bjaaland who made
us remark, on one of these last days, when
I was going by the side of his sledge. “And
the strange thing is that he’s scenting to the

dinary to see how they raised their heads.

At three in the afternoon a simultaneous
Halt rang out from the drivers. They
had carefully examined their sledge-meters
and they all showed the full distance—our

I know it would sound more effective—that
the object of my life was attained. I had

that moment. The regions round the North

Sou th Pole. Can anything more
topsy-turvy be imagined?
The return journey is as graphically de-
scribed, and the party arrived at their
winter quarters on the exact day prophe-
sied by Amundsen when working out the
plans of the expedition before its start from
Norway. And Australians will be interested

tions methods of work at the Bav of

Gissing
The truth about George Gissing is told by
his best friend, Morley Roberts, under the
transparent disguise of The Private Life of
Henry Maitland (Kell, per Dymoek’s
Library). Gissing is dead, leaving a name
in English literature, and his friend comes
forth to picture for us the man as he was,
frankly and yet reverently. The question
whether one literary man can thus botanise
on the grave of his closest friend can be
answered only by the need for the task and
the manner in which it is done. The truth
about Gissing has never yet been told,
though it was widely known that there was
a story to tell; and Morley Roberts in this
book has done his dead friend but bare jus-
tice in setting forth his inner life. From
this narration we come to a closer apprecia-
tion of Gissing’s work, and find a finer sym-
pathy for the man. Morley Roberts has not
used Gissing’s memory for his own ends.
As his biographer aptly says :
Henry Maitland stands on his own feet
and on his living feet. He is not a British
statue done in the best mortuary manner.
Ibere is far too little sincere biography in
Hngiish. We are a mealy-mouthed race,
hypocrites by the grave and the monument.
. . . .Here is life, not a story or a constructed
diary, and the art with which it is done is a
secondary matter....lf we have lessened
him at times from the point of view of a
hireling in biographic praise, we have set
him down life-size all the same.... Here is
the man.
Parenthetically, it may be remarked that
the art with which it is done is slipshod;
but the sincerity of the writer overrides the
carelessness of his style.
&
The story of Gissing’s tragic life thus
frankly set forth is this: While a
college student with a brilliant re-
putation, Gissing became infatuated with
a young prostitute, took her off the
streets, and determined to marry her.
To provide her with money, he stole money
and articles from the lockers of his fellow
students, was discovered, and sent to serve
a short sentence in gaol. On his release, his
friends sent him to the United States. Rob-
erts’s absence in Australia for three years
temporarily severed their acquaintance, but
when Roberts returned to London, he learnt
that Gissing was back, and had married the
girl. While in America Gissing had almost
died of starvation; and on his return to
London his plight, with a drunken wife to
keep, was little better. For Roberts, too,
there followed a period of bitter poverty,
whose only alleviation was the companion-
ship of his friend. And when his wife, after
periodically going back to the streets, re-
turned penitent, Gissing forgave her.
This was the kind of life that Henry Mait-
land, perhaps a great man of letters, lived
tor years. Comfortable people talk of his
pessimism, and his greyness- of outlook, and
never understand. The man reallv was a
hedonist, he loved things beautiful.' He re-
joiced in every form of Art, in books and
in music, and in all the finer inheritance of
P.£ But tfits was the life he lived, and
the lire he seemed to be doomed to live from
the very first.
At last the wife died. The husband’s one
tear was that the telegram announcing the
death might not be true. No sentimental
heroics, no sham grief here.
All the time he was publishing novels, and
gi tting for each but foO. He wrote eight
hours almost every day of his life, and lab-
ored desperately to achieve infinite perfec-
tion in his art. He often destroyed the first
tin id of a book, to begin it all wearily
again ; for he was forced to write with the
prospects of starvation always before him
Roberts rightly comments that Gissing ought
never to have written fiction at all
If he had had £5O a year of his own he
would have retreated into a cottage and
asphyxiated himself with books.
J*
His next venture in marriage was equally
unfortunate. Distracted by the loneliness in
which his shy temperament immured him, he
rushed out one day and spoke to a girl in the
street. Not even a pretty girl, though a
respectable” one. “The first woman,” he
told Roberts, “that I came across.” He
even admitted .that he did not love her—he
did not know what love was. And this girl
became his second wife, “to bear him chil-
dren, to torture him for years, to drive him
almost mad, and once more make a
financial slave of him.” At last he left her
and fled to Italy and Greece.
. Taking no exercise, hating visitors, shut-
ting himself up day after day to his work, Gis-
sing’s health rapidly became undermined.
“He had no business to be writing novels and
spinning things largely out of his subjective
mind, when lie ought to have been dealing
with the objective world, or with books.”
On the Continent, he met a young French
lady of Spanish origin, a woman of high in-
telligence and good education, a beautiful
woman with a wonderful voice, whose hand
Meredith kissed while telling her that she
had beautiful eyes. And, in the end, he
lived with her, with the consent of ’ her
mother. He shrank from divorcing the
almost mad woman his wife had become.
And this third venture almost came to dis-
aster over —of all things—cooking. Gissing
loved fat and oily things, and plenty of
them, and French cooking seemed to him
starvation. All through this curious bio-
graphy we hear of Gissing’s preoccupation
with food. But death intervened. After his
death Roberts was concerned to rebut the
claim made that Gissing had died in the
Church.
So, for the confusion of the writers of
primers of English literature for use in
schools, there is the man, George Gissing.
The French
lans is perennially interesting, and
studies of the French continue to appear
The two latest, France From Within, by
Claire de Pratz (Hodder and Stoughton)
and Parisian Year, by Maude Annesley
(Mills and Boon, both per Dymock’s
Library, Sydney), afford us the views re-
spectively of an Englishwoman resident in
laris and of a Frenchwoman educated i
England. Both have qualifications, bu;
Claire _de Pratz is necessarily the mor
authoritative.
Maude Annesley states that it is quit
com me il faut for a Parisian to have a mis
tress. He does not keep "her secluded, he i
ashamed of her, she is an acknowledgec
“I was at the' races one day with
Brench lady, and pointed out to her
woman who was passing. ‘Oh, look,’ I saic
what an awfully pretty woman.’ She turnec
to me smiling; ‘Yes, isn’t she?’ she answerec
brightly; ‘she’s my brother Pierre’s mis
tress. Can you imagine what, under the
same circumstances, the answer would have
been in England?”
« Als Or the Parisienne is not pretty. And
the frenchman knows far too much abou
a woman to be fascinating to me personally
It is so soothing to believe that one is a
mystery, and one can never believe that in
I ans .... .That is why the sentimenta
misunderstood love-story is impossible in
I ranee... .for does not a Frenchman know
at once when he begins to interest a
woman? And the French are not readers
in the majority of Paris homes one never
sees*a book.
From this light personal chatter of Maude
Annesley, one turns to Claire de Pratz’s
more serious study.
~ ’ If England is the masculine country of
the world, B ranee is essentially the feminine
country, for the principal qualities of the
i rencii are the characteristics which dis-
tinguish women.” Thus, they have charming
manners, they are remarkably frugal, they
nave perfect taste, in the industrial arts
they prefer delicacy and perfection of exe-
cution rather than strength, they are adapt-
able and assimilative, they lack emotional
discipline, they are too often exuberant

his own ruthless seeking of faults of versifi-

that 1 have heard some say that they could
not read Balzac because his style was so

form alone is everything, and there can be

declare that they prefer a commonplace idea

As for the Frenchwoman, ‘‘it might almost

ness. She has cultivated it and made of it
a true and preponderant force.”
A useful chapter explains the French

sonal instances, and shows how the training

Beauty’s Favourite.
The article which excels all others
In improving the beauty of the sßin
is naturally and deservedly beauty’s
favourite. This has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pears' Soap for
nearly 120 years. It won, and has
maintained that position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by the
possession of those special emollient
properties which soften, refine,
and impart natural colour to the
eKin. No other soap possesses
these qualities in such a pre*
eminent degree as

Gives New Life to the Invalid
An outstanding feature in “Wincarnis” is its
extraordinary power in re-creating lost vitality
and giving new life and renewed health to
those who, after a long illness,
a pitiable state of wrecked
shattered nerves.
are left in
health and
Renewed Strength to the Weak
Every wineglassful of “Wincarnis” equips
the system with a definite amount of renewed
health and strength that overcomes weak-
ness and exhaustion, and speedily gives to
the whole body a delicious feeling of physical
fitness that is Lasting.
Increased Vigor to Brain Workers
When the delicate mechanism of the brain
becomes disorganised by overwork, worry,
or by the ever-increasing demands of
modern business conditions, “Wincarnis”
has an immediate effect in stimulating
the activity of the brain and promoting
additional keenness and increased vigor
to the whole mental system, thereby
ensuring the brain-worker against future
breakdown.
A Wealth of Health to Everyone
To everyone whose health is not as it should
be—to those suffering from Anaemia, Sleep-
lessness, Weakness, Brainfag, Lowered
Vitality, Exhaustion, Nerve Troubles, or who
are merely “rundown”—'“Wincarnis” offers a
wealth of renewed health and'a progressive
upbuilding of vitality and vigor that will
make the whole system pulsate with new
life Over, 10,000 doctors recommend

W. J. Geddis, of much poundage in M L. journal-
istic circles, takes over the managing directorship of
the Tistes (Wellington). With his advent, a general
reconstruction happens. Politically, the paper will
keep its color, bu*t the public will be supplied with
the half-buried virtues of the old Seddon-Ward party
in a more forcible manner.
“B. de Burke” : The Rev. Leyton Richards, of Col-
lins-street (Melb.) Independent Church, preached
thus on a recent Sawbath :■ —-
“No greater injustice to the Church is done than
by the fact that her meetings and conferences are
often reported by men who lack sympathy with the
work done. We have a right to say that those who
report these religious gatherings should have this
religious sympathy, without which reporting becomes
a mere parody of the speech.”
And yet in the course of a long experience I’ve
known only two pious reporters. One drank himself
into hopeless disreputability, and now polishes door-
plates; the other eloped with/‘another woman.” But
I cast no stone at them. I keep it for parson
Richards. This was the same rev. who shortly after
his call (billets for parsons are always “calls” ; it is
only godless reporters and suchlike that take jobs)
sought to make a sensation by denouncing the Aus-
tralian Defence scheme, and urging Christians to
demand a conscience clause. llis sermon was a
general invitation to shirk the work of defending
the country—or else leave it to the godless reporter
and such-like. What I want to say to this newly
imported preacher of discontent is that no one should
criticise our Defence scheme if he lacks sympathy
with the work being done.
“S.T.S.”: These publishers speak a strange lan-
guage. Grant Richards advertises, for 18d., “The
Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (Persian Yapp).” This
seems a gratuitously offensive way of putting it,
but, then, one sees the same bracketed words at-
tached to Herrick and “Everyman.” Evidently a
kind of binding. “Susan (sewed)” is another
attractive offer. She must be the original Girl who
got the Needle.
Michael Fagan, who used to be poet Henry Ken-
dall's friend and boss and patron, died a week or two
ago at Kendall, on the N.S.W. North Coast. The
Fagan brothers were in the timber trade, and brother
Michael gave his poetic friend a job as clerk at a
store, and named the place after him. Later on,
finding that poetry and accounts didn’t get on well
together, he got him another job as forest inspector.
“Side Stick”: Recent references to John Fawkner
recall that he appeared on the Inky Way in
1838, at Melbourne, as the proprietor of the manu-
script Advertiser. Next year the Port Phillip
Gazette and Port Phillip Patriot appeared, both
printed. Then came the Herald (1840), the Argus
(1846), and the Age (1854). The Herald, like the
Argus and Age, was a morning paper, and, like the
others, started out at 3d. a copy ; then it was 6d.,
then 3d. again. The Age, later, reduced its price to
2d., and, not long afterwards, to Id. The Argus,
like the Register (Adelaide), took a long time to
make up its mind that a penny was a fair thing.
They both had, and still h%ve, reason to regret the
delay.
One of the uses of Melbourne Argus nowadays ap-
pears to be to serve as a training school from which
the once-despised evening rags can collect recruits.
Ex-Argus men at present on Melbourne Herald in-
clude the editor-in-chief (Jack Davidson), news
editor (Guy Innes) —Innes’s predecessor, Jack Nish,
was also taken from the old Tory organ—sporting
editor (Frank Hart), commercial editor (Rogers)'
acting-commercial editor (Morrison) and sundry
members of the reporting staff. And Sydney Sun
has an almost equal number, from Monty Grover
(editor) downwards.
The windy Fitzpatrick, M.L.A. for Orange (N.S.W.),
once published a book of poems sawn out of the
same stuff as his speeches. Some of the modest leaps
of his Pegasus: “O Baby Boy,” “The Farmer,”
“Wanted a Leader,” and “The Last Day is Come.”
The next bunch is more suggestive of oysters and
stout: “To Jess,” “To Agnes,” “To Dorothy,” and
“To R .” Also there were “Golden Memories.”
If some other members had written that last master-
piece, it would be safe to bet that thoughts of old
times on the Tote Commission had suggested it. But
whatever else he may be, Fitzpatrick isn’t that sort.
“S.T.S.” : Note the value of a comma. In Thomas
E. Spencer’s last novel, “Bindawalla,” he wrote
(doubtless) : “Leslie lit a cigar. Ruby seldom in
after-life smelt the aroma of a cigar but she fancied
she detected in it the scent of the pine logs as they
burned at the teamster’s camp-fire.” The printer has
dropped in a comma after the second “cigar,” and
quite altered the sense.
Sumner Locke wins a £2O prize offered by the
new London magazine, The Magpie, for a shori
story, “The Biggest Kill.” The energetic little
Melbourne woman is padding the inky way in
London nowatimes.
PAPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I begin to think there’s something in the paper that
you write on
(We’re all aware the pen’s the mightiest thing),
For there are certain sorts the muse attains its
highest flights on,
While others make for masticated string.
On paper made of sweepings from the street, it
stands to reason,
All self-respecting pens refuse to sweep
In a lofty classic cadence; and a decent ink would
freeze on
The chilling pulp of anything so cheap.
The perfumed, rosy sheets of love I leave beside the
question,
The cream-laid leaves on Which one may propose,
And the horny, hand-made horrors that convey the
faint suggestion
Of cold and callous lines of legal prose.
But here’s a slip that’s worthy of a rondeau or a
sonnet,
Its surface is a rhythm, its edge a rhyme;
Its very virgin vacancy bears melody upon it,
Its “face” recalls the age of the sublime.
The smooth and sized productions of the age of the
mechanic
Inspire to airy trifles, nothing more ;
But there is inspiration of a nature quite Satanic
In this upas-fibre fabric stiff with gore.
Then here’s a thing of straw that calls the cunning
pen to scribble,
To tell the way the wind blows on the mart,
And for flimsy flam and flip-flap and for fine inflated
fribble—-
Like this—which raises footle to an art.
Give me a leaf of copy-book, I’ll jerk you moral
dicta,
Post obiter, or otherwise, to show
The sin of getting caught in aught, in flagrante
delicta—
Oh, where’s my Latin grammar?—delicfo.
You’ll wonder what I’m writing on ; what papyrustic
satyr
Is daddy to this faun (that’s whitey-brown).
Well, most of it, I’ve told you in my modest im-
primatur,
Is foolscap, making up for double-crown.

A Well-Rounded Bosom
Is the Pride and Joy of All Women.
No woman need remain flat and undeveloped, thin, and
miserable. Your weight can be increased, and bust developed
to normal. It is done for hundreds of others, and can be as
readily done for you. If your bust lacks development and
firmness, and your arms, neck and shoulders are thin and
scrawny, even though your face is pretty, you invariably take
second place to your more fully-developed, full-bosomed asso-
ciates in your own social set. It will always be so unless you
correct the imperfections in your figure. Send a 2d. Stamp
for a Tree Sample of I>r. Falliere’s Flesli-Food, and our free
book which tells how. Flesh-Food is harmless to use, and the
treatment rapidly and permanently develops a poor figure to
normal. Thousands endorse it. Full particulars free.

present, have been cured in a few weeks, the worst cases responding as
readily as those only recently developed. If you are a sufferer you should
obtain particulars of this wonderful remedy.
THE VECSEV METHOD
of treatment quickly
stops the pain and sub-
dues the existing inflammation. Its continued application eradicates the
accumulation that distends the veins, and restores the valves and walls to
their original healthy state.
To sufferers from Varicose Veins the Vecsey Method of treatment
comes as a great boon. Previous to its discovery no painless, permanent
palliative was known. It cures the veins absolutely, so that they do not
return. CURES without laying up or detention from business.

SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nervous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good." It not only destroys the crav-
ing, the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.

More Light.
More light! The sun is glaring overhead,
And the hot earth below is glowing white;
nor blue, nor steel, but beaten lead,
Fining to furnaced porcelain, azure bright,
Where the horizon with the sea is wed,
And shimmering curtains veil their bridal
bed.
More light! the spirit cries, where, too
intense,
Uttermost radiance fills the earth and air:
So cry the shackled mind and stifled sense,
Smothered by lore, and blinded by the glare
And flash of science, striving for the sight
Of loved and lovely things and visions fair,
And the unearthly luminance of night.
Shadow these blasting fires ! Ah ! Light!
More light!

Brother in sorrow and seedy clothes,
Linen unlaundered and furtive air!
Desperate, destitute, though God knows
When graft was going you did your share!
Courage! It need not be always thus;
You are not done if you wish to rise.
Sweet is Adversity’s use to us ;
A man must want if he would be wise.
What time he wrote of the passing show —
Umar, the Persian, he knew, I wot,
What hunger was ; and he had to go
In rags and tatters as like as not!
How knew he else of the way to sing
His so convincing philosophies?
What gave his stanzas the real, true ring?
A man must want if he would be wise !
How have you bartered your fair renown?
Which of the terrible trinity—
Drink, drugs, women —has got you down?
One of them was it —or all the three?
What is the fault that you curse as “Fate”
That still at the root of the mischief lies?
I’ve been right thi-ough, and I know it,

A man must want if he would be wise!
Brother in woe —has it gone too far?
Say ! Has the canker too firm a hold?
Heavens! how foolish we mortals are!
How very cheaply our lives are sold !

Sorrow and shame, and our souls the price—

Spread out no more on tapestry of blossom-

The angels’ fare to feed the souls of dreamers

With some quaint mythological and pagan-
hued caprice
(As Jason and Medea questing for the Golden
Fleece),
Worked out in roll’d
Or beaded gold,
To make a centre-piece.
N T o heart-dust from the lilies swaying by the
river’s rim
Borne in on trays of silver by the singing
seraphim ;
No petals from the roses, blooming red by
castle sills;
No incense from the altars of the everlasting
hills,
Where breezes play,
Both night and day,
Amongst the daffodils.
No honeyed tongues of nightingales; no
wings of butterflies
Entrapped in nets of gossamer, nymph-spun
in Paradise;
No flavorings from pearly gems, dredged
from a star-strewn sea ;
No wine pressed from the rubies of the rills
of Arcady,
When in his fold
Each man shall hold
A goddess on his knee.
No lights drawn from the rainbow, and no
all-pervading myrrh
Breathed from the wattle’s blossoms when
the dreaming zephyrs stir;
No music fingered on the fronds by Mid-
night’s tuneful elves,
Who drown in cadent choruses the clock’s
rebuking twelves.
No more we’ll crave
What Fancy gave
The Muses’ larder shelves.
But give us hunks of sirloin from a lately-
murdered bull,
Aye, give us hunks —and hunks enough to
fill us very full.
Just feed your roses to the swine, nor even
keep the buds —
No matter if the scented mire is spattered
on your duds....
You’ve smeared with grease
The centre-piece.
It’s Jason for the suds!

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions , ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Edi.or, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name, “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there j the official always is.

ON THE URGENCY OF POETICALLY
EDUCATING AUSTRALIA.
It is significant that the whole of the disin-
clination to instruct the people in the pros
and cons of the Referendum questions
should have been displayed by Liberalism.
There has been no serious attempt in any
of the dailies to explain just what the pro-
posed amendments mean, and what is in-
volved in their acceptance or rejection. In-
stead, those journals have poured forth a
stream of blither about confiscation and day-
light robbery and the nationalisation of
everything—the secret aim, they allege, of
a sufficiently reputable lot of politicians
who, on the face of things, are seeking no
more than to effectuate certain measures of
which the country has approved, and for
which the Deakin party was itself respon-
sible in the first instance. When the Aus-
tralian Government decided last month to
print and distribute pamphlets containing
the cases for and against the Referendum
projects, Liberalism was as angry as though
some flagrant swindle had been unearthed.
Sydney Telegraph, for example, was scan-
dalised —just as it used to be a year or so
ago when the subject of compulsory service
was mentioned. Everywhere the voices of
Conservatism were to be heard remarking,
m effect, that an outrage was proposed, and
that insanity was abroad. They are still
uttering cries of a similar description, and
the reason lies on the surface. The whole
history of the Referendum goes to show that
a nation will never vote in favor of a Con-
stitutional change which it does not fully
understand. This applies even to the radi-
cal-minded Swiss. Between 1874 and 190(5
the Referendum has been employed 18 times
in the land where the waiters are reared.
Twelve of the proposed amendments have
been carried, the others rejected. All but
two of those which have been agreed to
were turned down one or more times before
the people decided that there was no danger
in them. Of the six highly-complicated Ini-
tiative demands which have been put to tiie
electors since 1891, only one has been ac-
cepted. Several of the proposals which have
been rejected over and over again by the
nation, and which are still awaiting accept-
ance — e.g., Compulsory Insurance, a Fed-
eral match monopoly, and the Right-to-
Labor scheme of 1894 —have been approved
by both Legislative Assemblies; and they
are still approved by people who would be
infuriated if they were accused of being
Socialists. Until the common or garden
elector has got the complete hang of any
vast change in his system of government, he
will have none of it. He will not leap in
the dark. That is one of the reasons why
the fight for Home Rule has been such a
long business, and it accounts, to a large
extent, for the heart-breaking difficulties
which confront those who are striving to
save the United Kingdom from itself by
means of a Protective tariff. To boil the
position down, a nation cannot get ahead of
its average level of knowledge and intelli-
gence. It automatically achieves the legis-
lative changes to which its capacity and edu-
cation entitle it.
When the. position is regarded in its pro-
per perspective, it would be a very wonder-
ful thing if with the scanty means of infor-
mation that have been placed at their dis-
posal, the bulk of the electors of Australia
did know epough of the problems involved
in the Referendum proposals to enable them
to give a considered verdjct. A comprehen-
sion of the changes involved necessitates a
close acquaintance with the doings of the
Australian Parliament since 1905, if not
earlier. How many citizens remember to-
day, in any sort of detail, what Parliament
did so recently as yesterday? It also neces-
sitates a certain knowledge of Constitutional
law. What proportion of the electors takes
any stock whatever in Constitutional law?
Most intelligent people have a general idea
of the meaning and aim of, say, the New
Protection. They understand that the idea
was to impose excise duties on certain classes
of manufactured goods unless such goods
should have been manufactured under con-
ditions approved of by Parliament or by in-
dustrial authorities appointed by Parlia-
ment. But few of them appreciate the
deadly effect of the Trade and Commerce
Clause in the Federal Constitution, on that
almost uniyersally-approved measure of re-
form. Not one elector in 10 has troubled to
follow the closely-reasoned discourse in
which Chief Justice Griffith declared the
Excise Tariff Act to be invalid. In fact,
setting aside the average man, it seems safe
to say that not one solicitor or importer, or
architect, or squatter, or other presumably
cultivated citizen in 10 has any serious ac-
ouaintance with the questions at issue in
the Referendum campaign. Let a Referen-
dum discussion be started in any first-class
railway carriage, or club, or expensive hotel,
and it as certain as death that the man who
says he means to vote Yes will bring a stm-m
of dissent and reproach on his head. But
none of it will betray any inner knowledge.
Wild, inconclusive shouts about Socialism,
Disloyalty, anti-imperialism and dishonest
schemes to separate honest men from their
hard-earned savings will be heard. The Pro-
gressive will be called a pro-Boer—mayhap,
told that he has no right in any respectable
bar. The less muddled objectors may per-
haps introduce the State Rights question,
and contend that a thousand bizarre in-
famies may be done to Victoria or N. S.
Wales by the Australian Government if
Parliamept is given any more power than it
has. But these enraged folks are incapable
of explaining the whys and wherefores of
their weird theories. If anyone doubts the
tragic ignorance of the average prominent
citizen in regard to the signification of the
Constitutional changes that the .Australian
Government aspires to make, he might find
the following table of test questions useful
as a means of dispelling his illusions. Let
him put these queries to the citizen in ques-
tion, and if that self-opinionated person sup-
plies. off-hand, a coherent and generally
satisfactory answer to so much as a third of
them, this paper will eat its oldest and
toughest hat.
(1) What was the Trade Marks Act. 1905? On
what grounds was it declared unconstitutional? Give,
roughlv. the gist of the dissenting judgments in this
matter?
(21 What, in particular, stirred Justice HrGGINS
to complain that the Federal Arbitration Court had
been surrounded by the High Court with a “Ser-
bonian bog” of technicalities? Supply reasons, if any
exist, why this state of things should be suffered to
continue.
(3) Do you revere the British Constitution? If
not, whv not? If so, why do you regard Unification
as a calamity in the case of Australia ? Is there a
Trade and Commerce clause in the British Constitu-
tion, and, if not, how do you account for the fact
that the commercial rights of (say) Yorkshire have
never been assailed by tfie House of Commons?
(4) What bearing had Appleton's case on the power
of the Australian Parliament to deal with Trusts?
Assuming you had an income of T 3 10s. per week,
do you consider that you would get better value for it
in the U.S., where the Trusts are nractically uncon-
trolled ; or in England, where Parliament is empow-
ered to scotch Trusts the moment they get over the
odds in the matter of rapacity ?
(5) Have you read Bryce's “The American Com-
monwealth,” Dicey's “The Law of the Constitution.”
or Wise's “The Commonwealth of Australia” ? If
not, what standard works have you studied in the
search for enlightenment on the more intricate pro-
blems of government?
It is pretty obvious that the man who is
baffled badly by such questions is acting the
part of a fraud and a liar when he dogma-
tises on the subject of the Referendum cam-
paign, and the horrors of an affirmative or
any other sort of vote. He is as out of place
in any discussion on the subject as an ape
would be at the helm of a battleship. One
of Australia’s tragedies lies in the fact that,
in every walk of life, he is appallingly fre-
quent.
The Bulletin remarked close on 18
months ago, when the Fisher Government’s
Referendum proposals were turned down:
‘‘The task that faces the Nationalist party
is now mainly educative.” The pronounce-
ment still stands. And as no progress is
going to be achieved till the gloom lifts,
those who are interested in the future of the
Commonwealth require to get busy without
delay. A well-run democratic daily would
do much, but there seems to be no prospect
of anything of the sort before next Federal
elections. Lacking such an organ of - en-
lightenment, knowledgable speakers want to
pound the facts of the case into the some-
what wooden head of the people with tire j
less energy. On political platforms, during
the next few months, the dreary old topic of
the enemy’s crimes, idiocies and demerits
generally might with advantage be dropped,
and the attention of the orators confined to
some such subject as the urgent need to em-
power Parliament to frame a uniform com-
pany and banking law, and an explanation
of the reasons why nothing can be done in
that direction at present. It is immaterial
whether the problems are approached from
a Liberal or Labor standpoint; the essential
thing is that they should be dragged into the
light of day and aired in a spirit of intelli-
gence and sweet reasonableness. Acknow-
ledged experts—men of the tvpe of W. M.
Hughes. W. H. Irvine, P. McM. Glynn
and B. R. Wise —would do their country a
service if they lectured on these big and in-
volved issues. Above all, the best use should
be made by both Labor and Liberal Leagues
of the informative pamphlets which the
Fisher Government is making available to
the electors —the volumes which the Sydney
Telegraph, ever progressive, described as
“errand boy literature” and “waste paper.”
If these booklets are done with any sort of
skill —and there is no reason to think they
will not be —the elector will only have his
own apathy and incapacity to blame if, after
due investigation, he hasn’t a fair working
idea of what the Government aims at and
the Opposition objects to.
TO SAFETY—WITH DANGER IN THE
ROAD.
The Australian system of sea-defence has
made good in the eyes of those best quali-
fied to judge. Admirals of the British fleet,
statesmen with their fingers on the pulse of
East and West, have alike spoken th ir ap-
proval, and those tremendous loyalists who
some time ago waved toy flags and shouted
for the presentation of Dreadnoughts for the
sake of Empire (with and without an H)
now find that the Empire itself was on the
side of their opponents and applauds the
Australian patriotism which decided to
create a fleet unit of its own, in spite of all
the frothy mouthings of those who thought
Empire was a bundle of imported rags, or
a Governor’s cocked hat, or some equally
futile thing connected in some indefinable
way with a large stomach and a Union Jack.
Now that an Australian fleet is actually
taking fjjrm, the whole thing is seen in its
true light. The declaration that Australia’s
tate must be decided in the North Sea is
counted out, the menace of Asia is fully re-
cognised, and the defence of the Pacific is
seen as a problem of the white ra.ce which
can only be settled in the Australian way.
* * * *
The practical object of the Conference pro-
posed to be held at Vancouver is to bring the
Dominions of Canada and Maoriland into line
with Australian ideas. Everything points
to the conclusion that these countries will
be urged, and even pressed, to create their
own fleet units which in time of trouble
may be ready to co-operate for the main-
tenance of peace or the speedy success of
war. _ It is a big step forward, and imagina-
tion is not called upon to do any special
gymnastic feats in conjuring up a mental
picture of the great white man’s fleet of the
future which may absolutely hold and police
the Pacific. For all practical uses the fleets
of the United States be one with those
of Canada, Australia and Maoriland; and
with the enormous potential wealth which
can be drawn upon, and the constantly in-
creasing population of the countries con-
cerned, it does seem hopeful that the naval
strength of the white man in these seas will
grow to be such that no nation or combina-
tion of nations will dare throw down the
gage of battle or attempt anything in the
nature of invasion. Thus, armed for peace
everybody may be able to sleep quietly at
night, and the whole garden will be lovely.
* * * *
But in the working out of what really
amounts to a great insurance scheme against
the horrors of Asiatic war lies Australia's
more immediate danger. The wide un-
settled lands of the Commonwealth present
a far more attractive field for exploitation
to the Asiatic at our northern gate than the
cold western portion of Canada, the already
well-settled Pacific Slope, or the small and
mountainous islands of Maoriland. If Asia
is to find room and scope for expansion in
a country of sunshine and opportunity it
must be in the northern portion of the Aus-
tralian continent. As things are, the per-
son in Canton or Tokio knows there is no
need to hurry. He is well aware that it
must be some years before Australia has an
adequate system of defence, and with ordin-
ary luck there should be complications in
Europe which will give him his chance be-
fore the balance of war-machinery or pre-
paration is against him. But with naval
combination, and three, if not four, nations
building fleets to checkmate him in any game
he may play, the whole position of affairs
will be entirely changed. His best if not
only hope, in that case, is to move swiftly and
try to reach his goal before the white Triple
Alliance of the Pacific has become too strong
for him. Plainly, then, the Vancouver Con-
ference. while working towards ultimate
safety for all the countries concerned, will
increase the immediate danger of Australia
However rapidly the programme of ship-
building may be pushed forward, it must be
several years before the joint fleets of the
white races in these seas are equal to the
present Asiatib navies. It is during those
vears that the real Australian danger must
be looked for; and the greater the speed
with which keels are laid and plates ham-
Tngred the nearer is that critical moment
forced. Asia is not entirely without weight
in the councils of Europe ; and the trouble
out of which it may grasp its opportunity
can in large measure be engineered. When
it is remembered that with all civilised
peoples straining after peace, and most bar-
barous nations fearing war, it requires the
utmost skill on the part of European states-
men two or three times in every year to pre-
vent an international resort to arms, it must
be seen how easy a matter it is for a power-
ful outside nation to disturb the delicate
balance of affairs or increase the tension to
breaking point. With a big war on in
Europe Asia gets its chance, and unless the
future 4 b'elies all the past, Asia will work for
that chance before the infant navies that are
being built have reached the point of being
formidable barriers. This is not mere specu-
lation, but a reasoning based upon the
natural law that peoples which are held in
check by none of the restraints of European
civilisation will follow the line of least re-
sistance and get all that they can a,t the
smallest cost to themselves.
Australia’s position in the matter should
be quite clear. Eventually, if any aggres-
sive move on the part of Asia can be suffi-
ciently delayed, the great combined fleet of
the Pacific will make the Commonwealth
safe and enable it to work out its own
destiny as a white man’s country.
In the meantime sea defence cannot be
relied upon to give us adequate pro-
tection, and we must look to our military
system to pull us through. All the strategic
necessities of our citizen army—uniform
gauges, a direct railway from south to
north, the proper settlement and garrison-
ing of the Northern Territory—will become
infinitely more urgent after the Vancouver
Conference than they are to-day. All the
work of that Conference and all the hope
of a great Pacific fleet may amount to no-
thing if Australia should fail to hold its own
in the years during which the fleet is in the
making. To put the matter in the
possible way: yesterday Australia had pro-
bably 20 years before it had reason to seri-
ously fear invasion; in six months’ time
that period of probation may be reduced to
five years or five weeks. If the Vancouver
Conference does the work that is expected
of it, Australia becomes party to a challenge
thrown down to Asia for the supremacy of
the world’s biggest ocean. That challenge
may be a loud noise or a serious fact; but
having made the challenge we must be ready
to stick to it, and expect the other fellow
to hit us where and when he can without
further warning. That we cannot be wholly
prepared goes without argument; but by
good luck, and by taking earnest matters
earnestly, we may be a good deal better pre-
nared than the other fellow gives us credit
for being. In any case, it is the only chance
Wo TlflVO.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Blayney, and After.
The results of the Blayney election make
one fact surprisingly plain. Wade is still a
tremendous asset to those politically opposed
to him. Beeby, with his nebulous third
party propaganda, made a poor enough show-
ing at the first poll; but when it came to a
question of Wade or no Wade, the public
decided that any old thing was better than
to give a majority in Parliament to the party
led by the hero of Kembla. From the moment
that Beeby definitely declared that he would
give Wade no support, his stock went up
enormously. So the third party gets its
show, and may with luck become a second
party, and oust the Wade-Wood conspiracy
from its place as the recognised Opposition.
There is very little doubt that many elec-
torates in which there has hitherto been a
fairly even balance of parties would vote
much as Blayney did if a moderately attrac-
tive third-party man took the field; and a
party which had no black record behind it
(having the good fortune to have no record
at all), and which would put forward a
platform that looked a little like progress
(though it mightn’t be progress to any ex-
tent), ought to have a very fair show as
the game is now played. The nity of it is
that all three parties in N.S.W. stand for
State Frights, and all the small and tricky
devices which mav be employed to hamper
the progress of the Commonwealth. If we
must have narty oolitics. it seems a poor
business that a State like N.S.W. can’t
have something which at least resembles an
Australian party. The Laborites promised
to he that party, and their promise is still
all right; but the performance of McGowen,
Holman and the lately-departed Beeby has
been simply ghastly.

A Manly Nation at the Bast Ditch.
The “manly nation” theory looks strange
and sick when considered in the light of Tur-
key’s present situation. If the Turks have
seldom been described in the exact terms of
the theorists who despise armaments and
advocate baresark exploits in the hour of
national extremity, they have at least been
recognised as possessing the qualities of ster-
ling soldiers. Although their record for some
hundreds of years has been mainly one of
retreat and disaster, and although their em-
pire has been constantly decreasing in area,
there has been scarcely an Ottoman cam-
paign in which Turkish valor has not won
the plaudits of the world. Now the Turk
finds himself pent within his capital, deserted
by Europe, beaten in arms by the last and
least of peoples, hated for his cruelties, de-
spised for his ignorance and yet too proud to
yield. Now, here is a case for the
“manly nation” theorists. If valor, backed
by desperate zeal, could save a nation against
modern armaments. Turkey ought still to
come out on top. It has plenty of men. an
immense prestige, which, though badly
shaken, is still workable, and it is at least
10 times better armed, and prepared than,
say, Australia. The supporters of the
“manly nation” idea would have Australia
wait until it is attacked, and then bog in just
as H stands. Now. why can’t Turkey hog in
as it stands, and win?


The Rush to Bankruptcy.
The trade returns of Victoria, once the
State of High Protection, have just been
issued; and they tell this deplorable tale.
Gross Imports. Gross Exports.

Here is disclosed the awful fact that in the
last three vears imports have increased y
more than 50 per cent., while exports have
increased only about 7 per cent, it ma
be said in explanation that a succession _
good seasons has led the people to si
more freely, even extravagantly: but wny
spend in imports? Or it.may.be claimed
that the general advance in prices largely
accounts for the abnormal increase , him
same general advance applies with even
greater effect to exports. The above figure.

I hus, while imports of merchandise have in-
creased more than 50 per cent, in three
years, exports of merchandise have remained
practically _ stationary. The once great
manufacturing State of the Commonwealth
is sending away only £4 10s. worth of goods
to pay for every £7 worth it imports. How
can that last? The details of imports
tor 1912 as compared with 1911 show where
es ' Apparel jumped from
£0,605,178 worth to £6,219,228 worth —just
II per cent. Machinery increased by 16 per
cent.; manufactures of metals, 19 per cent.;
iron and steel bars, galvanised plates, pig,
etc., 26 jier cent.; cement from 544,979 cwt.
to 934,878 cwt per cent. And
while unmanufactured tobacco increased a
bare 4 per cent., manufactured tobacco in-
creased 17 per cent. It is safe to say that
the increase was almost wholly due to in-
creased population; but the foreigner got
the work that the immigrants should have
had. Comparing the two sets of figures
given above, it is seen that last year Vic-
toria alone sent away £3,253,066 in gold and
specie. The balance of the £8,723,442 is
still owing, or has been paid for out of our
accumulations or met by loans, public or
private. Again, how long can it last?

A Study in Political Suicide.
According to S. M. Herald (23/1/T3)
There is a division in the N.S.W. Cabinet over the
question as to whether the new State Governor shall
reside at Federal Government House. The chances
are said to be in favor of the building being again
occupied by the King’s representative.
It is significant that the Herald, which
was formerly absolutely violent on this sub-
ject, had no protest to make against the
change which it forecasts. State-fright
Liberalism is already beginning to rightly
view “the Eviction” as a masterly move
in the anti-Australian campaign. The
McLinen-Henley agitation has fallen flat.
None but a numerically insignificant class
takes these deplorable old advt.-seekers seri-
ously : and of this section fully 90 per cent,
have now realised that the ousting of the
Governor-General represents a smack in the
eye to the Australian Government. The
paltry minority, composed of incredibly
stupid Tories, such as those who still advo-
cate the hired-navy system, continue to
curse the Eviction, and to subscribe money
to dispute the legality of it. But in a little
while they, too, will see, and applaud the
disreputable business as warmly as any of
the alleged anarchists who attended the
banal opening ceremony in Government
House grounds last month. Some facts
which have dawned on the Sydney Liberal
or Geebung are that by turning Federal
Government House into a State residence,
a more financially important type of Gov-
ernor may be attracted (the Rawson
variety of figure-head could not possibly
support the place) ; that Sydney will there-
by be benefited in its pocket and its pride;
and that the local Personage will no longer
have to periodically play second fiddle on
his own heath, so to speak, to a higher func-
tionary. Above all, it has been borne in on
the Liberal that the Australian Government
has been affronted and embarrassed, and no-
thing cheers a genuine Liberal more than
that. What consolation the people who
supported the McGowen Government at
last elections are to get out of the unsavory
business is, however, hard to say. Most
democrats are Australian-minded, and don’t
relish the spectacle of a Commonwealth
Labor administration being harassed. They
are, moreover, very far from desiring a
change by which the office of State Governor
is likely "to be perpetuated indefinitely. In
fact, they want the imported State Gov-
ernor arrangement abolished as soon as pos-
sible. The imported official costs the State
at least £IO,OOO per annum, and does abso-
lutely nothing for the money that might
not be done equally well by a local Chief
Justice. It is a good point, more especially
iu the case of a State which owes
£100.000,000, and begins, in consequence, to
feel the need of taking a pull on itself here
and there. In fact, it is so good a point
that the wiping-out of the office of State
Governor has for long been the first plank
in the N. S. Wales Labor Party’s platform.
To Democrats, then, the McGowen Gov-
ernment’s action in manoeuvering to dispos-
sess the Governor-General, with the object
of installing a State Governor, will certainly
appear inexplicable and exasperating. As-
suming the Herald is correct in its fore-
cast (and The Bulletin, which has been
making remarks to the same effect for the
past nine months, has no reason to think
otherwise), the position amounts to this.
The McGowen Government, by a •nammotn
sacrifice of principle, will have gained the
gratitude of militant State Frightism. But.
this section consists almost entirely of red-
hot Conservatives, who would as soon vote
for a skunk as for a Laborite On the
other hand, the Government will have won
the furious disapproval of every Nationalist
and genuine Laborite in the country. It
political battles are to be won a ong those
bizarre lines, this paper has still a lot to
learn about electioneering.

The Doctrine Which Is Written Down
by Its Own Supporters.
It must make the genuine anti-Socialist
writhe to read the views ofaUegcdlyann-
papers of the S. M. herald
stamp —that is to say, the views that are
expressed elsewhere than in the leading
articles The Socialism of these pronounce-
ments is naked and unashamed In the most
cynical fashion imaginable, the writers in
the alleys and byways give the lie direct to
those whose job it is to move heavily along
what one may call the main streets, or
market places, expounding the official policy
of Liberalism. Take, for example, the fol-
lowing, which appeared in the municipal
section of the Herald on Thursday last.—
The municipality of Manly has no.
ns we find in the seaside resorts in the Old World. As
f contrast to Manly—perhaps, also a source of inspira-
tion—take Torquay, on the English coast. ll >e coun-
cillors of Torquay have done much in the way of
municipal enterprise to draw mjjuw
corporation’s* pmposa7s "include a "modern installation
of medicated, electric and seaweed baths, the improve-
ment of the Princess Gardens, the erection of a public
library, municipal offices, town hall, and pavilion for
municipal orchestra. The pavilion is just completed,
at a cost of £21,000. The Princess Gardens are laid
out upon reclaimed land. They contain a theatre, a
cafe, a restaurant, a roof promenade, dressing-rooms,
etc. At the official opening the fine municipal
orchestra supported a galaxy of operatic artists from
the London Opera House, and an audience of 2000
assembled to hear them. Scarborough is another sea-
side resort from which the Manlv councillors could
learn some “points.” The possibilities of Manly are
illimitable; and they should be developed.
Let the reader imagine for a moment that
the mayor and aldermen of a N. S. Wales
township have been sufficiently daring to
follow' the Herald’s advice. They have
started Socialistic theatres, picture shows,
restaurants, hotels and caf£s. They have
not gone to the extreme length, perhaps, of
putting £21,000 into a music pavilion and
importing expensive singers to their Social-
istic opera house. Instead of these luxuries
they have invested what superfluous cash
they had in more or less necessary things
like brick-works, fruit-shops and milk-runs.
Now picture the attitude of the S. M.
Herald’s leading columns in regard to those
ventures —something like this :
SOCIALISM IN OUR TIME.
Six months ago the ratepayers of the thriving town-
ship of Bustte were misguided enough to return a
majority of Laborites to the local council. We ven-
tured to prophesy at the time that an era of mad
experimental Socialism would swiftly follow. Our
forecasts, we regret to say, were nearer the mark than
we ourselves anticipated in our most apprehensive
moments. Discretion, economy, the wisdom and ex-
perience of the ages from the days of Plato to our
own time have been flung aside. The Socialistic Tiger
rears its horrid head broadcast, and there are none
among the City Fathers with the sense or courage to
beat it back. Socialistic baths, playhouses, eating-
places, drinking-shops, roof gardens, caffes, etc., have
already been planned, with ruthless disregard both to
the rights of Private Enterprise, which has been suffi-
ciently courageous to blaze the track (however inade-
quately) in all these lines of business, and to the first
principles of political economy. The more thoughtful
residents are inexpressibly shocked. Many of those who
flouted Liberalism, against our express and repeated
warnings, on the grounds that it was “a fair thing” to
“give Labor a show,” are now extremely perturbed.
“No more Labor for me,” one of them was heard to
remark bitterly, a few days ago. Meanwhile the
damage is done. Capital is leaving the township in
thousands.
And so forth, and so on. That is the sort
of assault that would be visited by the
S. M. Herald on the municipality
which was sufficiently progressive to
take the advice which the S. M.
Herald itself tendered to Manly last week.
It is a curious position. A Labor paper
which, while nominally believing in munici-
pal and State enterprise, barracked tire?
lessly for the abolition of post offices, hospi-
tals and other manifestations of Socialism,
would be no more illogical, and no less un-
worthy of serious attention.
The War-horse Supply.
The Japanese mailboat Kumano Maru,
which left Sydney last week for Yokohama,
had a number of horse-boxes on the after-
well deck. They contained 15 Australian
thoroughbreds intended for the Jap forces,
and the army captain who bought them was
good enough to tell the newspaper young man,
before leaving, that he thought the animals
“would make fine chargers for the Japanese
officers.” No doubt they will. But their
departure also makes it harder for the Aus-
tralian Light Horseman to pick up a decent
mount at a reasonable figure. The Indian
and “Eastern” trade has, for years, been
draining away thousands of Australia’s
best horses; but the patriotic onlooker
has at least had the satisfaction of
knowing during all that time that
most of them were going to carry British
warriors. Also, the S’African war re-
duced Australia, for a considerable time,
to a state of equine insolvency. The
Kumano Maru shipment is going to
the other side of the Pacific without
let or hindrance of any sort. The Aus-
tralian might take off his hat and breathe a
short prayer that neither the valuable 15
nor their descendants may ever set hoof
again on Australian soil. If they do, the
odds are they won’t come barebacked. Mean-
time, Robertson, veterinary expert to the
Australian National Government, has just
yielded a report which points out the grave
state of the local military horse supply. Com-
mandant Hoad declared that £317,400 ought
to be spent at once on breeding establish-
ments. Robertson declares that all this,
and more, is needed. The Australian army
requires in one way and another 40,000 good
horses. Kitchener, Hoad and all authori-
ties concurred that it was no use relying on
hired artillery horses. They must be trained to
it, or the guns cannot be served, as is proved
in' all manoeuvres. Further, if we really
hold ourselves prepared for w T ar, there must
be a margin for great wastage, and a copi-
ous supply behind, ready to come up like a
bubbling spring. As for that wastage, it is
worth recalling that General I rench
knocked out 10.000 horses during the march
to Pretoria —which gives some idea of what
the reserve ought to be.
\ glaring example of the manner in which
the wishes of the democracy are thwarted
bv Partv Government is to be found in the
present condition of affairs in regard to the
tariff. Returns just issued show that last
vear imports into the Commonwealth totalled
£7B 098 313, an increase of £ll : 13U,8zo on
those of the preceding year, which in its
turn beat 1910 by nearly seven millions. On
the other hand, our exports last year de-
clined to the extent of £647,528. At the last
election the people spoke as clearly as pos-
sible bv returning to Parliament 52 Pro-
tectionists pledged to Tariff Reform. Now
another election is almost upon us. and the
tariff is in no more danger of being re-
formed than Lais, of Little Lon or Boozer
Rttt or anv other old-established human
derelict. Customs Minister Frank Tudor,
at heart a good Protectionist, is in the grip
nf the party machine, and has refused in his
Ministerial capacity to carry into effect .his
own 'election From the Fusion,
which has just elected one of the most per-
sistent Freetraders as its leader, even less
is to be expected. Jokook has declared that
fart of his policy is that the present tariff
shall be maintained. This statement was
hailed with joy bv the I reetory Argus,
which stated that “no genuine demand, for
increased duties exists. Of course, it is
eminently reasonable that a Foreign-trader
like Jokook should wish to maintain a I ro-
tectionist” tariff which admits £i<X,(>()o.ooo
worth of imports in the course of a year.
But what of the people who sent those .y.
men to Parliament to reform the tariff and
make it truly Protectionist? In deference
to party demands both sides have “sunk the
fiscal question,” and if something drastic is
not done they will just about sink the Com-
monwealth. The most obvious and forthright
way to prevent this is to sink Party Govern-
ment.
The N.S.W. Industriae Gazette treated
itself to a retrospect in its last issue; and
the Labor Government which runs it might;
do a lot worse than read the contribution,
just to be reminded of a few of the results
of borrow and boom. The present outbreak
of borrowing insanity on the Ma State’s part
has never before been equalled. The nearest
approach was in the late ’Bo’s and early
’9o’s. Then Cohen buttoned up, and the In-
dustrial Department found itself busy ladling
out relief soup. In the winter of 1892 the
Bureau provided shelter and blankets for
500 or 700 destitute workers in Sydney, and
30,960 rations were distributed. In the first
month of the State Labor Bureau’s exist-
ence 4965 persons registered as being in need
of employment; within three months the roll
had grown to 8945, and in six months to
13,447. By February, 1893, 18,600 were
begging for work ; 7500 of these were married
men. The year 1893-4 was even worse. There
were then 6000 workers in the building trade
alone out of collar. Over 4000 men were
sent to old goldfields to fossick on rations,
and semi-communal settlements were estab-
lished at Bega, Wilberforce and Pitt_ Town.
In the year ended February, 1895, over
13,500 out-of-work men had been registered
at the Bureau, and 16,000 had been assisted
and sent to jobs. From that date to Febru-
ary, 1896, 14,600 men nlaced their names on
the register, and 20.570 had been aided.
Between February, 1895, and February,
1896, no less than £201,591 was expended in
free rations, relief work, etc. And it is safe
to say that tens of thousands of people who
never got State assistance needed it desper-
ately, tens of thousands of others felt the
pinch of want, and still other tens of thou-
sands who had believed themselves in com-
fortable circumstances found themselves poor.
All this was the direct and natural conse-
quence of a borrowing boom—of the creation
of artificial conditions precisely similar to
those which have been produced to-day by
the deplorable Labor Ministry which has
poured scorn on Labor principles and ioined
hands with the boodlers of the community.

At the last meeting of the Brisbane General
Hospital committee, it was decided to ask
the Home Secretary to revise or delete the
rule obtaining in most country hospitals that
“venereal cases shall not be admitted.” A
case in support of the change was reported
in the Cairns press some few months ago.
A man suffering from “a certain disease”
(those northern papers are very delicate)
applied for admission to the Cairns Hospital.
He was refused. He promptly went down
the main street, broke a street lamp, was
just as promptly arrested, and when he ap-
peared before P.M. Grant frankly stated
that he broke the lamp in order to get gaol
treatment. The P.M. was sympathetic, and
gave him two months; in which period he
thought “defendant might be cured.” Medical
science not only admits, but impressively
teaches, that of all diseases common to man-
kind there is none so far-reaching in its
effects as syphilis. Yet. while one case of
bubonic will cause a terrified scare, the
authorities turn the other adrift to do its
worst. It is as inexplicable as it is abomin-
able.
♦
The Picture Combine, blossomed the
other day, promises badly. Not only will it
raise the price of the people’s amusement,
but it has already smashed up the beginnings
of a hopeful Australian industry. No more
Australian-made films are to be shown in
the theatres of the Combine after the stock
on hand has been worked off. The local
picture-making staffs have been dispersed.
One firm not so long ago opened a fine
theatre and studio at Sydney, and laid down
an excellent plant for the production of
films. That theatre is now closed, and the
staff scattered. Other companies had then-
operators, their actors, and their weekly
gazette of local events. The Australian
play-writer was also pushing in and getting
an occasional job, and the job threatened to
become more frequent. The Combine, ends
all this It practically controls the picture
theatres of Australia. Its various members
have thrown their exclusive agencies into the
pool, and in order to get reductions on the
quantity have agreed to use only imported
films. Thus, though the local film-maker can
of course go on producing, he will be unable
to place his product. Two remedies suggest
themselves —legislation by the State to com-
pel picture showmen to present an Austra-
lian-made film for every imported one ; and
Federal legislation imposing a repressive
duty on imported films other than what are
known as “scenics,’ and such as from their
very nature cannot be produced in Australia
suc h, for example, as the Durbar pictures.
If such productions are excepted, the Gov-
ernment will lay-out the otherwise inevitable
whimper that the authorities are interfering
with the education of the people. With
these films excepted, there is no earthly
reason why the Government should not go
ahead ; there are a hundred reasons why it
should.
The training ship Tingira is stationed in
that part of Sydney Harbor called Rose Bay.
There abide permanently on board a large
crowd of embryo mariners and their instruc-
tors The water is shallow and more sluggish
in this part of Port Jackson than in almost
anv other. For that reason the neighbor-
hood smells none too sanitary at low t de
alreadv. After a year or so of the lingira
it threatens to be unbearable. There are
plenty of more suitable mooring grounds;
and to hang on to the present site is equiva-
lent to imploring Providence to send along
disease.
From another strangled town:
You drop out at a tiny railway station, after
passing through miles of spleudidcountrv, part of
the famous Liverpool Plains (N.S.W.). The fertility
of the land is, in one respect, the curse of the town ,
for it took the eye of the early land-grabber, while
less attractive country escaped. Thus it comes about
that the N S. Wales country townships which should
have gone 'ahead most have gone ahead least. .
There is a little wooden bridge over the Narnoi at
this Ounnedah —a bridge which brings back memories
of the one that used to swing across the old willow-
nattern date. It is perched high above the general
level and the approaches rise steeply on each side—
The Bridge Across the Crick.

Joseph Jones and Peter Dawking
Strove in an election fight;
\nd you’d think, to hear them talking,
Each upheld the people’s right.
Each declared he stood for Progress and
against his country’s foes
When he sought their votes at Wombat,
where the Muddy River flows.
Peter Dawking was a student,
Of a kindly turn of mind.
A reformer, keen but prudent,
Aiming but to serve mankind —
Just a simple, thoughtful scholar who e’er
kept this aim in view :
“Tricks and shams are sinful folly ; we must
see the Big Things through !”
Joseph Jones had never tasted
Fame, but he was sly and fat;
And, ere he set out, he pasted
This reminder in his hat:
“Noble aims are platform blither, and the
art of politics
Is the game of nobbling voters with soft
words and cunning tricks.”
Up at Wombat, where the Muddy
Trickles down amongst the ferns,
Folk care little for the study
Of great national concerns ;
But they pride themselves on being plain and
practical and slick.
And the burning local question is “the
bridge across the crick.”
Bland, unfaithful politicians
Long had said this bridge should be.
Some soared on to high positions,
Some sank to obscurity ;
Still the bridge had been denied it by its un-
relenting foes —
By the foes of patient Wombat, where the
Muddy River flows.
Peter Dawking, scorning party,
As an Independent ran;
Joseph Jones, loud, blatant, hearty,
Was a solid party man.
But electors up at Wombat vowed to him
alone they’d stick
Who would give his sacred promise for the
“bridge across the crick.”
Up at Wombat Peter Dawking
Held a meeting in the hall.
And he’d spent an hour in talking
On Reform’s insistent call
When a local grey-beard, rising, smote him
with this verbal brick:
“Are or are yeh not in favor of the bridge
across the crick?”
Peter just ignored the question,
Simple and unselfish man;
Understand a mere suggestion
Men like Peter never can,
Or that free, enlightened voters look on
Great Reforms as rot,
While a Burning Local Question fires each
local patriot.
Joseph Jones, serene and smiling,
Took all Wombat to his heart.
“Ah,” he said, his “blood was b’iling”—
He declared it “made him smart”
To reflect how thev’d been swindled ; and he
cried in thrilling tones:
“Gentlemen, your bridge is certain if you
cast your votes for Jones !”
Joseph Jones and Peter Dawking
Strove in an election fight,
And, when they had finished talking,
On the great election night
They stood level in the voting, and the hopes
of friends and foes
Hung upon the box from Wombat, where the
Muddy River flows.
Then the Wombat votes were counted :
Jones, tw r o hundred : Dawking. three.
Joseph, proud and smiling, mounted
On a public balcony,
And his friends awoke the echoes with
triumphant shouts of glee :
For that vote saved Jones’s Party by a one
majority!
Jones’s Party—note the seouel —
Rules that country of the Free,
And that fight, so nearly equal.
Swaved the whole land’s destiny.
And the‘Big Things of the Nation are de-
layed till hope grows sick. _
Offered up as sacrifices to “the bridge across
the crick.”
Brothers, in this Age of Reason,
Seers, economists and such,
Preaching in and out of season,
Seldom seem to matter much.
And, when next you see the Joneses snar-
ing votes with shameful tricks,
Marvel not that’ Big Things languish in the
game of politics.
Dawking ‘now is sadly fearing
For the crowd’s intelligence.
Joseph, skilled in engineering.
Full of porno and sly pretence.
Still holds out the pleasing promise of that
bridge whene’er he goes
Up to Wombat, patient Wombat, where the
Muddy River flows.

so steeply that laden teams have often to double-
bank to get oyer. When the river is low they use
the old crossing below the bridge in preference. That
seems to suit the unprogressive place best.
From Curlewls, about 11 miles nearer Sydney, the
traffic is much heavier than it is from Gunnedah.
But, then, all round Curlewis the land is closely
settled, while Gunnedah is shut in by large stations —
Pullaming andtGunnible on the east and north, and
half a dozen others to the west and south. “Any
amount of room to expand,” says the local buttress
of the principle of leaving things as they are; and
he gets a map and shows you how you can worm
your way in between the stations, and get here and
there a bit of soil. But the curse is none the less
real. The pick of the country is locked up; it is
under sheep, which give very little employment,
except at shearing-time (and most of the shearing
now is done by contractors who travel with their
teams) ; so the young men must go away to find
work, and the money that would otherwise be saved
Up and put into local farms goes far afield.
There are many empty shops in the one main
street, and few customers even for those that keep
their doors open. Gradually, too, the number of “emp-
ties” is growing instead of getting less, for new tenants
do not come to take the place of those who P'o. The
large modern station doesn’t want the local shop.
Tts own store is filled, and it does all its business
direct with Sydney. It keeps an account at the bank
in the township, loads its wool and such stock as it
s'dls at the local railway station, and receives its sup-
plies there. Jt gets its letters and telegrams, and
has a telephone line to the local post office, but that
is the extent ;of its connection with the township.
If it wants men it sends to the city or picks up
“travellers.” So the grievous state of the strangled
township is becoming more grievous than ever, and
the death gurgles grow fainter and fainter in its
throat.
Sydney’s great Easter jamboree of the
horse, cow, gum-leaves, farm produce, whisk-
ers, machinery, saddleship, etc., known as the
Royal Show, ; s to be made a bigger attrac-
tion this coming March than ever. The
prize money has been increased to £6OOO,
which means more competition, and that, in
turn, means a better exhibition. With favor-
able weather a general crash of records in
all departments is probable.
The N.S.W. Labor League has been hold-
ing its annual conference in Sydney this
week ; and the alleged Labor Government of
N. S. Wales has had a little of the roasting
that was coming to it. To prevent a repeti-
tion of past betrayals, the State pledge was
altered to bind Labor candidates to support
also Federal and municipal platforms. While
the conference was about it, it might also
have invited the party to get on speaking
terms with the State platform.
“Maorilander,” his protest:—
To me it is a sad thing that amongst the worst
and most foolish traducers of the Australian is the
Maorilander, or, rather, some of him. Visiting the
Australian cities for the first time, he is astonished to
find that things are not done anyway like they are
in Mangaweka or Invercargill. This makes him say
so much that the old reproof, “You ought to see the
moon we’ve got in Auckland,” has to be rubbed in.
The latest sinner is T. L. Mills, chairman of the Aus-
tralasian Country Press Association. In that capacity
he recently blew into Australia for the first time to
attend a conference. He was in the Commonwealth
fully 20 minutes, and when he returned burst into
nrint in a string of papers. This is how he summed
things up: (1) The Sydneysider’s horizon does not
extend further than his harbor, and the Melbournian’s
no further than St. Kilda ; (2) the man in the coun-
try longs for the day when he can get a job right in
the heart of things, where every prospect pleases and
only work isivilo; (3) the Australian citizen is sel-
fishness personified ; (4) the imported Socialist of the
glib tongue. . . .has got the ear of the masses, and is
the clog on the wheel of progress; (5) the result ?s
that in neither the Federal nor the N. S. Wales Par-
liament was there any appearance of respect or discip-
line;' (6) the onlooker from Maoriland felt thankful
every time he visited those chambers that he belonged
to another country and another people ; (7) there is
no strong dominating leader., and most of the Minis-
ters have that tired feeling; (8) the Laborites of
N.S.W. largely idolise Holman, and for long enough
have been urging that he. .. .should become Premier,
but he has not the tact of McGowen; and (9) a
whole lot of other stuff that usually is served with
onions. Included in it was a suggestion that the
Australian was a “clock-watcher” or loafer. Now. I
am a good Maorilander. and I have lived in Australia
for a considerable number of years (and years are
more than minutes), and, with unusual opportunities
of judging. I say that, man for man, the Australian
is one of the best workers (hand or brain) in the
world. Only the hedge-hog observer could class him
as selfish : and as for the political observations of
Mills, their absurdity requires no comment. I hate
to mention this matter, but somebody has to tell
the Maorilander (or some of him) that though ignor-
ance ma.y be bliss, there is no need to blow folly to
the skies.
From The Bulletin's Stipendiary
Corporal ■
Enver Bey, the “Young Turk,” who upset Kiamil
at the point of the revolver in Constantinople last
week, belongs to the order of men who do things, and
there are some charming possibilities about him. In
Tripoli, with a handful of Turkish troops and a crowd
of undisciplined Arabs, he reduced the Dago invaders
to such a of nerves that they would not leave
the shelter of their ships till he had been wounded
in his attack on Benghazi. This time he is up against
a sterner problem. The Bulgar is a better man than
the Dago ; yet if Enver is to make good he must
smash up that crowd of Bulgars outside Chataldja in
short order. Otherwise the Powers will probably
squelch him. If he can induce the Bulgars to at-
tack he will probably win easily enough. But the
chances are they won’t; and he must score a vic-
tory to justify himself. The Allies are bluffing, for
everyone of them is exhausted financially if not
physically. Enver is quite willing to let Albania
go. He will also cede a big lump of Macedonia, Novi
Bazar and other trifles. But Thrace and Adrianople
and a strip of Macedonia to take in Salonica he will
not part with without a fight. So he has rushed an-
other 30,000 troops across the Bosphorus, and with
300,000 men is preparing to take the offensive. On
the fate of his first battle much depends. If he wins
the Allies will drop bluffing and make peace. If he
loses, there will be a scramble for Constantinople.
And that may mean any sort of Hell’s brew.

It is announced that there are only a few
more yards to go before Sydney Criterion
reaches the last of its “Milestones.” Those
few belated individuals who haven’t seen
this sermon in stones are adjured to be in
time for the last lap.
* * *
At Her Majesty’s, “The Sunshine Girl” is
the complete success that musical comedy
Girls always are wherever the flag of O’d
England, Bruce Smith and the British Em-
pire League is flow#. A dull song or two
have been lopped off her skirt, so to speak,
and a few yards of superfluous gags have
been hewn from her blouse, and the effect is
to make her even more distracting than she
was oh her first appearance 10 days ago.
“Faust” is in its last agonies at Sydney
Theatre Royal; in fact, the death-rattle may
be expected at any moment now. Playgoers
are not tired of seeing the central figure of
the show thrust into Gehenna nightly and at
periodical matinees. The trouble is that
other attractions are clamoring for the use
of his death bed.
* * *
At the Palace (Sydney), on Saturday
night, Allen Doone and Co. revived that
Doone-like production, “In Old Donegal.” The
show calls for no special mention, excepting
the astounding popularity of Doone’s singing,
or, maybe, it’s the songs that touch the
(mostly) Austral-Irish audiences on the
raw sentiment. It must be the songs. As
far as this paper is concerned, it reckons
that if Doone could act as well as he can
sing, he would be the Worst Actor in the
Vicinity. The season will close to-morrow
week.
The Church and the Devil, or. as it is
billed at the Sydney Adelphi. “The Monk
and the Woman,” are still enjoying a pros-
nerous alliance at the Marlow tabernacle.
The next event there is “The Beggar Girl’s
Wedding,” hut as yet its date is so vague
that the duke, or the major-domo, or who-
ever the other party is, may be trapped by a
red-headed widow before the worst can be
accomplished.
TWO TIVOLI WARBLERS.
Claire Romaine ,
Male Impersonator.
Chas. Zoli, Dago
comedian.
The Newcomers’ Stakes at the Tivoli this
week provides an exciting finish, and the
Lancashire Opera Co. gets the decision by a
head from the Maxini Bros, and their dog.
The Staley and Birkbeck musicians, who
finish third, bring along still another varia-
tion of the over-worked zylophone, plus some
quick scene-changing. Bobby, the Maxinis’
dog, is about the best-trained canine that has
happened along since Barnold’s Dan, and is
an accomplished acrobat as well as a humor-
ist. Of the rest of the field the Patty
Franks, Alexander Prince (his last per-
formances), and My Fancy carry most of
the public’s money. Claire Romaine’s ut-
terly impossible ihales continue to please
some and bore others: and Mozetto, Chas.
Zoli and Florence Baines are going strong.
On Saturday Rosie Lloyd (comedienne)
and Will Poluski (comedian) will do their
best to justify their labels.
St: * si: *
The Era Comedy Four—negro rag-time
specialists—are about the best goods the
National Amphitheatre has to offer this
week ; anyhow, they are among the freshest.
Wilson and Pritchard, acrobats of the more
or less humorous order, are likewise new to
this glittering haunt. Louie Duggan, Lyla
Thompson, Hugh Lloyd and Leonard Nelson
are also busily employed earning their screws
and avoiding the Bird, as good artists should.
Quite suddenly came the announcement of
the last nights of “Antony and Cleopatra,” at
Melb. Royal. The tempting Egyptian whom
hungry Tony, in his turn, did find a morsel
cold upon dead Caesar’s trencher, ere yet his
red hot gaze had warmed that regal piece to
passion, will nurse the pretty worm of Nilus
at her breast for the last time on Friday.
Next night she that was Cleopatra will so
bend her spirit to a blusterous bridegroom
that when he bids her name the sun the
moon she’ll go one better and call it blessed.
In short, “The Taming of the Shrew” fol-
lows “Antony and Cleopatra” on Saturday.
The revival is advertised for one week only,
and “Midsummer Night’s Dream” will pro-
bably be ready to succeed the domestic
comedy.
i!s ij*. ;Js
In its suggestions of panto, extravaganza,
the madness of “No Mother to Guide Her”
seems a seasonable enough Marlowmatter
at Melbourne Princess’s. The central figure
is Miss Ethel Buckley, in the character of
Little Red Walking Frock, or Sweet Nan of
Old Fury—a rough diamond of purest ray
serene. Her legs and feet are bare, her cos-
tume is most becoming, her manner of re-
r ceiving the first kiss of love from a converted
Bob betokens innocence and virtue, and her
habit of threatening Villainy with a firearm
at the end of each act commends the lady
to public esteem. In the beginning, the
festive Nan looks likely to become the Trilby
of criminal life. Hilliard Vox controls her
with his Svengalic eye and De Bierey swank.
Like one in a dream, the poor, bare-legged
maiden aids and abets the baleful Vox; but
as soon as he begins to mix murdering with
burgling, the hypnotic spell passes from her,
and she denounces him to the police, who
take no notice. Nobody on the stage takes
much notice of astounding incidents in “No
Mother to Guide Her.” Nor is there any
attempt to explain the title of the piece.
Nan, indeed, has a mother —a long-lost
mother found in Miss Guildford, a sinful,
scornful woman of fashion, who does nothing
but try to drown, choke and poison Miss
Elwyn Harvey, except when she is busy
making love to the Rev. Robert Inman. The
other heroine (Miss Harvey) is certainly
motherless, but she doesn’t Want guiding.
She has money to burn; she seeks the bubble
reputation even at the parson’s mouth, and
after the man with the gimlet eye lias hyp-
notised her into accusing herself of parricide,
she needs no mother’s hand to lead her out
of quod. Being rescued by Red Walking
Frock, she remains at large with maid-ser-
vants to wait on her, until fat old Burglar
Bill (J. P. O’Neill) proves her in-no-cence
with his dying confession. He dies of deli-
rium tremens, so his confession, sworn before
Bob and a donah, amounts to convincing evi-
dence. Some of the dialogue of the last act
indicates that Bill should have been scorched
to death, rather than jim-jammed. The plot
and dialogue are otherwise under suspicion
of having Marlowed on the premises. In any
case, the entertainment is a shocking absurd-
ity. Yet it might have been worse. It is at
least free from bedroom scenes, baronets and
glittering haunts of vice. J. S. Mann’s scen-
ery is good, better and excellent; also the
acting is far more than the drama deserves.
At the King’s, the company as well as the
bill is to be changed on Saturday. “My
Jack” closes the present season. A new
stage treatment of Marcus Clarke’s “Natural
Life” will restore Roy Redgrave to the scene
of his many bygone heroisms; and whilst
Good Mr. Dawes is working out his salva-
tion, Bad Mr. Gabbett will go chasing his
human dinner with an axe. This paper has
always loved Gabbett. He is its pet cannibal.
* * * *
The holidays are ending, but “Puss-in-
Boots” continues to make good eight times a
week at Her Majesty’s. Strange to say, no
members of the co. have been seriously in-
disposed thusfar.
At the Opera House the mob of Arabs
(late of Sydney) burst into the proceedings
last Saturday, and did the things which their
ancestors and the ancestresses did when the
world was young. Like the laws of the Medes
and Persians the turn of fin Arab troupe
altereth not. The principal strong man in-
variably serves as the foundation of a great
human structure, and a co-operative gallery
is formed as of old, and the performance
concludes with somersaults and handsprings
all round. These Arabs come quite new to
the present Melbourne generation, and the
effect of their joyous strength and agility is
exciting. Dr. Mario and lady, in their Frogs’
Paradise act, are other welcome newcomers ;
Kitchen and Foy, on the horizontal bar and
bounding net, put some unfamiliar humor
into their clever gymnastics ; and De Biere
is the more sought after because he is about
to take his departure. Also, Nella Webb is
going away.
Melbourne Majestic has poured forth the
old tale of “The Babes in the Wood” in a
very bright series of Pa f be-colored views.
The picture was an excellent thing in its
way. Even the naughty uncle could not have
looked worse. “The Power of a Hymn” was
a contribution of a religious nature. Accord-
ing to the yarn a cove named Tom takes to
evil courses, but when he hears a hymn that
mother taught him in days of yore, he sud-
denly quits his wicked behavior and adopts
the plug-hat of a blameless life. “Bidoni
and the Lions” was a fairly humorous com-
edy, and there was also a picture of the
famous Don Q., the extremely rude old Dago
who left cadavers lying about.
“PUSS IN BOOTS," AT HER
MAJESTY’S , MEL-
BOURNE.
The Dame
(George Miller).
The Miller's son
(libel by Fred
Leslie).
Spencer has been screening an animal-
chewing sensation, “The Panther’s Prey,” at
Melbourne Olympia. The quadruped was
introduced into a narrative of sin and adven-
ture, and its attempt to dine on a lady of
engaging contours was as realistically effec-
tive as the circumstances would permit. For
several moments the heroine wrestled on the
floor with the hungry visitor, and she was a
most dishevelled and breathless female when
the hero blew in with a pistol and made the
beast a remains. “A Trip to Montserrat”
gave some views of that precipitous pimple;
and “Saving the Game” showed snapshots of
Yankee football, which seems a mixture of
hide-and-seek and running amok. Among the
comic efforts, “Love on Tough Luck Ranch”
presented some phases of the tender passion
with all the delicacy of dinosaurs at play.
The programme submitted by the Dandies
at St. Kilda (Vic.) last Saturday was duly
examined and found generally melodious.
Fred Monument presented the best bouquet
of ditties, his baritone being equal to the
demands of such a rollicking air as “The
Jolly Sailor.” Misses Tessa Byrne and Flor-
ence Henderson were as tuneful as formerly,
and Ben Calvert asked his Beloved to Look
Down in a voice as rich as a creamy fruit
salad. Miss Dorothy Manning, Renn Mil-
lar and Herbert Walton were also among
those who spoke with considerable success.
Adelaide shows have had the advantage
of the Foundation Day holiday, a new thing
to South Aus., but taken to kindlv. Lalie
Brooke (with costumesj, Paul Gorden (with
a slack wire) and George Dean (with his
voice), all at the King’s, are the chief items
of interest. Redgrave, Brampton, Her-
bert Leigh, and Miss Vera Remee at the
Royal, and Miss Mabel Hardinge at the
Tivoli, are all acting better than their plays
deserve. Wondergraph shows “John Ster-
ling” (a film of the Crook, the Cheild and
the Grafter, very American) ; West’s, “The
Mills of the Gods” (melodrama) ; Empire.
“The Stolen Favorite” (horse). And if
Branscombe’s “Dandies” would go wrong, or
break down, or be anything but steadily and
monotonously and deservedly popular, there
would be more to say about them.
“Petramos” (from London), concerning
the Grand Prix de Lucifer: —
When you tell Berlin that Paris is inclined to be
gay, Berlin utters the scornful ha-ha and says “You
must come out with me to-night.” Reviewing the
card, I think Berlin will get to Hell first. Paris
has been well trained, arid is likely to be a stayer.
It gets so much support from Englishmen and
Americans that the Folies Bergere runs an almost
all-English bill, and the ladies who provide relaxa-
tion in the garden and promenade provide it in very
good English. Also, a man may go to the devil
there on American cocktails, and find the journey
expensive. Most of Paris’s naughtiness is trained
on wine, whereas Berlin goes gay on lager beer.
Hamburg becomes a devil of a fellow on a cup of
coffee. These two German candidates for the Lucifer
Stakes are naturally giddy, and the visiting Presby-
terian must either learn the language or note the
dimple on the cafe girl’s knee with mute astonish-
ment. London parades its naughtiness and Picca-
dilly and Oxford-street, at 11.30 p.m., may mislead
backers into giving the Fog some support. Paris
presents a phenomenal bunch of giddiness in its
main streets also; but Berlin and Hamburg hide
their chances of success where no casual punter is
likely to see them. From stable secrets revealed,
however, I place them thus: Berlin, 1; Hamburg, 2;
Paris, 3 ; London a bad fourth.

AT POVERTY POINT.
Edward Branscombe’s attempt to create a literary-
drama circle in Tasmania by shipping McMahon’s
Repertory Co. ,for a holiday season in Hobart and
Launceston, seems to have been a bit premature.
Hobart was even less prepared for the shock than the
Younger City. The title of the opening piece—
“ Chains” —drew a large audience that mostly
wanted its money back on discovering that the
Chains were merely domestic. Hobart had expected
a lurid melodrama introducing a convict gang and
the clank of leg irons. On the second night five
policemen came to watch the plot of “Man and
Superman,” and report on its morals. Indecency
was suspected and blasphemy was feared, Super-
man” sounding rather like an alias for the Almightj.
The first act was too much for a number of the
naicest local ladies. After listening awhile to the
family discussion re Violet’s supposed impropriety,
those outraged ladies left the hall. They didn t wait
to learn that Violet had been a “respectable married
woman” all the time.
Van Biene’s death on the stage of the Brighton
(Eng.) Hippodrome was about the most opportunely
dramatic exit oh theatrical record. He didn t actually
die at the exact moment when he was supposed to die
in the play, but he dropped back in his chair insen-
sible at aljnost the exact moment, and was dead soon
afterwards’. His heart failed whilst he was bending
over his ’cello to nlay the last bars of ‘‘Home, Sweet
Home.” Practically he succumbed to the hard work
of expressively rendering a silly old tune on a chest-
contracting instrument.
“O Iv ” ■ Given an efficient musical training in his
youth’, the late Van Biene would probably have been
the greatest ’cellist of his time. As it was, he man-
aged to get himself taken seriously by the musical
world, and only last year he gave a series of recitals
in London. The few things that Van Biene had been
playing for many years in “The Broken Melody he
played remarkably well. He had the soul of the
artist and the true Cockney irreverence for the cant
of art. What time he was staging The Broken
Melody” at Melbourne Princess’s, a cellist named lol-
desy was appearing with Miss Elizabeth Parkins
(Parkina) at the Town Hall. Foldesy was a capital
“techniqueist,” with a somewhat hard, matter-of-fact
tone, and Van Biene on being asked what he thought,
of the young Hungarian, said: “Ah! if I had his left
band and he had some of my grease, my fried-fish
feeling,’ we would both be fine performers The
Jewish fried-fish feeling in Van Biene s touch on the
instrument made him second to none as an inter-
preter of sentimental melodies. There was much
pathos and passion, too, in his voice and broken Eng-
lish accent. Hard to say at this distance of time
whv his melodrama fell so flat in Australia eight
years ago. It was much less foolish than many ot
the dramas we get nowadays, and his company in-
cluded at least one forcible actress —Miss Mane Ilig-
nold. But Van B. and his unique entertainment were
a failure.
The Repertory Theatre Club (Melb.) will be ex-
pected to rally to the support of Intellectual Drama
on Friday evening this week, at the Austral Salon.
Gregan McMahons circular convening the annual
meeting states that “to ensure a continuance of the
work of the Theatre and its Club, it is essential that
the club membership shall be not less than 400.”
Therefore existing members, in addition to re-
enrolling themselves, must drag recruits into the
Intellectual Light Brigade. There should be no
great trouble in making up the minimum number.
The Charge of the Gallant Four Hundred is only
£1 Is. a year.
“R. 8.”: N.S.W. Government’s proposed Conserva-
torium of Music should rake the world for the best
musician securable as its principal; and before it
has nailed him to the job, it should discover whether
he is merely a good musician or a musician hoppled
by literary crankiness. The training of musical
students is in many cities obscured by the inclusion
of papers on Schopenhauer and Metsche, with lec-
tures on the rationalism of atheism and the foolish-
ness of the marriage ceremony—things which have
nothing to do with the industry of semiquavers. Art
is lyrical, anyhow, and this dragging in of studies
of philosophers, and critics of conduct, and more or
less lunatic exponents of social anarchy is mere pea-
cockery and waste of the valuable time of youth.
“K. 0.”: The least satisfactory super in Asche’s
impressive “Antony and Cleopatra” show is one of
the two buck niggers whom he brought with his
“Kismet” outfit. All the silent, colored figures in
Cleopatra’s palace wear an air of Egyptian calm save
this bona-fide blackfellow, who looks as though he
wanted to be restless, and is apt to grin at the girls
in his vicinity. The girls give him no obvious en-
couragement to play the Irving Sayles, but he grins
all the same. . Meanwhile his mate on the other side
of the doorway looks as miserable as a bandicoot.
“Ireland To-Day,” which was well advertised from
Dublin before the films were shipped, is the most boom-
some picture show that has toured Victoria. In the
country districts it draws Home Rule advocates from
miles around, and every ardent Mickey brings a pill-
box with a view to purloining a few grains of the
Irish soil (duly certificated) that is spread between
the pay-boxes and the doors. They have to buy a
ticket, begorra, before they can stand on the ould
sod. V
A line dropped out of an “0.K.” par. (B. 23/l/’l3)
and made Orpheus McAdop, of the Fisk Singers, start
a bootshop instead of nftanager Loudin, who first
brought the coon singers to Australia. McAdoo re-
mained a showman to the bitter end.
“Stargazer”: J. C. Williamson, just back from
Europe, admits grudgingly that the one-act play is
enjoying a vogue in London; but, says he, “I am
convinced the people of Australia do not want a
curtain-raiser. They want rather a play long enough
to supply ,a whole evening’s entertainment.” Well,
why not give it to them? Many of the plays put
on here are not a fair evening’s entertainment; but,
instead of giving an additional little play, the
generous managements allow their patrons intervals
so long that many of us forget what has happened
in Act 1 before Act 2 comes along.
“Constant Writer”: Re G. R. Sims’s idea that
London theatres will have to compete with the music-
halls by giving two shows a night (B. 23/l/’l3),
Joe Waldron, chief of The Waldrons, who have made
a couple of tours in burlesque sketches on Australian
variety circuits, told me when he was last in Sydney,
some months ago, that he believed he was the only
man who had regularly put on pantomime twice a
night. This annual outbreak was well received in
Lancashire (his chief hunting-ground), especially as
Joseph has a luxuriant touch of Lancs, in his voice
and some taste in matters of figure and such-like.
But the change would be very hard on the actor.
That point is illustrated by the joy (that word’s iov,
not jag) with which vaudeville people from the U.S.
greet the fact that in Australia they’ve only to appear
eight times a week. At some American variety houses
it’s not a case of two shows a night, but of as many
shows as can be packed into a day and night, with
Sundays even more strenuous than the rest of the
week. It’s the land of perpetual grease-paint. The
change to sufficient leisure for occasional surf-bathing
or what not (especially what not) has JSiade many an
American vaudevillain compare this land to the place
Little Eva went to.

“Rosna” (in London) : A. E. Martin, sometime the
cheerful “Petramos” Of many Australian press contri-
butions, has developed into the most notable animal-
hunter in Europe. Spurred on by the success of his
friend, Beaumont Smith of “Tiny Town,” he has been
hustling all over the continent, applying the education
test to animals, and has got together a show that con-
tains nearly every beast on four legs, except a trained
rocking-horse and a performing nightmare. There is
a sharpshooting monkey, a dog that can tell the inner-
most thoughts of a politician, a donkey with a college
education, and a troupe of melodrama dogs playing
“The Bloodstained Hound.” Also, there is a handful
of giants, including a little girl of 16, who didn t
give up playing with dolls till she was 7ft. high, and
a ,dusky young gentleman of 29 years and 221 b. The
show is to open in Adelaide at the end of February.
Saharet, the famous dancer, always described as
Australian, recently got a divorce from an American
husband Saharet really is Australian, though she left
Melbourne at 16, long before her toes had learnt to
twinkle.
“T. Tintack”: “C.0.M.” (Cove Obviously Mud-
dled) has evidently got the Combine microbe badly.
Why should a big film Combine or Trust desire to
squeeze out of business the suburban picture shows,
which are its consistent customers for films? Why
it should not do so would seem so obvious that
even a frantic devotee of small production and petty
back-street trading methods ought to tumble to it
right away. “C.0.M.” and his like are invited to
consider the position in U.S.A., where the small
picture shows exist by :the thousand, notwithstanding
that a big Trust amalgamation controls both pro-
duction and the supply of their programmes.
“B.”: “Bookware” (B. 9/1/T3) writes that
“Dryden” is the only dramatist who has challenged
Shakspeare and lived”; and “All for Love” is not
such a drop from “Antony and Cleopatra” as one
would expect. Figs! What does “Bookware” call
living? When was “All for Love,” or any other
tragedy, or any unspeakable comedy, of Drvden’s
last enacted on a stage? Dryden challenged Shale -
speare’s “Antony and Cleopatra” about as much as
Colley Cibber challenged the great Elizabethan’s
“Richard III.” with his interpolated mongrel ver-
sion. Dryden seems to have been somewhat fond of
“challenging” Shakspeare. He and Sir
Davenant (Shakspeare’s putative wrongly-begotten
son) “mended” “The Tempest,” giving Caliban a sis-
ter-monster, Sycorax; and Miranda, who, in Shak-
speare’s play, had never seen a man, is made
acquainted in Dryden and Davenant’s “improvement”
with a man who had never seen a woman. Dryden
“challenged” Shakspeare also by altering the great
dramatist’s “Troilus and Cressida,” making the last
scene in the third act thereby (in the opinion of
some) a vastly greater masterpiece. But Dryden, in
his coarse experiments, went further. He made an
“opera” of Milton’s “Paradise Lost,” and thereby
degraded the noblest epic to which the muse of Eng-
land can lay claim. Truth to tell, Dryden was not
a poet or a dramatist. He was a man of letters of
the school of Pope, Swift, Johnson, etc., and the
greatest of them all. His dramas are gropings after
expression, and many are the rhymed couplets. His
comedies are frankly indecent. His verse is the verse
of the school of Boileau ; and his poems (so-called)
are metrical exercises. Dryden did, however, teach
F.nglishmen how to write good, strong, nervous Eng-
lish prose. He set a style, and it was a good style.
But challenge Shakspeare!
“Kavlee”: I find that both Lauder and Wilkie Bard,
London’s pet humorists, are better actors than come-
dians in the sense that the music-halls use the word.
Lauder is a remarkable Scotch character-actor, and
might have stepped right out of a Barrie yarn. Bard
is a quiet, impressive “character” man, who gives a
picture of a night watchman that is quite probable.
The audiences don’t burst their weslcit buttons with
mirth while they’re on the stage, but make a great
noise when they threaten to leave it. Lauder and
Wilkie Bard are at the top of the tree, and it speaks
something for the Cockneys who are keeping them
there.
(Continued on page 30.)
The negro mummer who told the press, the
other day, that Australia would be all the
better with 100,000 Afro-Americans should
go to schodl to the intellectuals of his own
race. So admittedly unsuited are the blacks
to a Caucasian environment that their own
leaders of thought are moving the heaven
and earth of their financial power to get the
race out of America and re-established in
Africa.
In a brief biography of Premier Massey,
of Maoriland, the Daily Mail Year Book
for 1913 puts it this way:—
He is not distinguished for tactics, nor even for
tact; but shrewd common-sense, a happy gift of
speech, and an unblemished honor make him a
worthy successor to the Fitzgeralds, Rollestons and
Atkinsons, who guided the colony’s affairs in past
days.
And this is what that great Democrat,
George Grey, had to say about the Atkinson
crowd: —
The continuous Ministry, which for years held
office, robbed the people of the Country of their lands,
rendered women and children landless, perverted a
great estate given to Maoriland by a riiunificent
nation, squandered the revenues of the country, and
incurred great debts to give value to the property of
their friends taken from the people.
The Daily Mail Year Book no doubt
meant to be kind; still, in view of Hon
Grey’s description, it ought to hurriedly
withdraw before the bees start to swarm.
Thus E. B. Tredwen, chairman of the
Australasian section of the London Chamber
of Commerce, giving evidence about the Ab-
sentee Tax before the Dominion’s Royal
Commission: —
I think it will be recognised as fair that income
from undertakings that receive the benefit of the pro-
tection afforded by the laws of the country where
they are situated, should make some contribution to
the Government, and that individuals receiving the
benefit of the laws for the protection of their persons
should also make a contribution ; but I am of opinion
that it is both unfair and injurious for the contribu-
tion to be as high as if the person were receiving
both benefits mentioned above simultaneously in each
country.
But the absentee who “receives the coun-
try’s protection for his undertakings, isn t
around to help the country to protect his
undertakings when they most nee “ pro-
tecting—viz. T in time of war. Then the non-
absentee has to carry the whole swag of
fight and horrors. Even considered as
payment in lieu of military service, the
Absentee Tax is thus entitled to a fair run.
“BULLS AND BEARS.”
Lines written for The Bulletin by a “bull'’ of J,
D. Williams shares at 21s. forward.]
Farewell! farewell! to this cold world !
Let salt tears dim the eye.
Unto the shambles am I hurled;
The time has come to die.
I went into the picture show.
I saw the cowboy play,
The schoolmarm from Noo Yark who killed
An Indian every day,
The film of domesticity,
The bride who lost her ring,
And Foolshead drifting in the sea,
And airships on the wing.
But, best of all, the film that showed
The burglar’s money sense,
The highway man upon the road,
The trick of confidence,
The splendor of the footpad’s theft,
The murder weird and dree,
And men of moral sense bereft,
And glorious piracy.
And then I from the flickergraph
Sped to the Stock Exchange,
And bought me many Williams shares
At prices weird and strange.
Of “forward” scrip I soon was full,
Ere westward sank the sun,
An unsophisticated “bull,”
1 bought at one pound one 1
And now the slump is here, I know.
That they were most unfair
Who said I was unfit to take
Intestines to a bear.
For now I see that all those films
But illustrated me;
I bought some shares from burglars, some
From uncles in Fiji.
I was the sport of highwaymen.
The spoil of them that range
The Pitt-strcet bush, and buccaneer
Upon the Stock Exchange.
I was the Foolshead of the show;
The saphead and the squid ;
Blackbeard the pirate took my watch ,
I nurtured Captain Kidd.
But, ere I die, one thing I’ve proved—
As one who greatly dares —
That T’m a “bull” who’s fit to take
Intestines to the “bears.”
Farewell, farewell, to this cold earth,
Ere sinks the westering sun ;
Stranger for ever I to mirth —
I bought at one pound one.

THE DEATHLESS “STAR.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She’s featured in the magazines;
Likewise the illustrated press;
She is the “star” that bags the beans ;
She is the longest-boomed success ;
She’s proved her great artistic scope
Since she appeared with “Someone’s Soap.”
You find her photographed afar;
On hoarding she has pride of place;
She brightens up the railway car,
Three-colored in her fluffs and lace —
She gets the spot-light good and fair
In Jobkin’s “Bug Juice for the Hair.”
Though “stars” may come and “leads” may go,
The actress of the poster ad.
Will last as long as joy and woe
(Perhaps in years a myriad)—
She is eternal on the bills,
The heroine of “Saved by Pills.”

ARTHUR LLOYD WINDSOR.
Arthur Lloyd Windsor, for 28 years edi-
tor of Melbourne Age, had the grim reputa-
tion of being a woman hater. His tiny circle
of intimates know that he was nothing of the
kind. He was a man who hated nobody ; but
he wanted nobody. So long as he had his
work and his books he was satisfied. David
Syme, his chief and closest friend, used to
say that no man needed an encyclopaedia when
Windsor was about; as a matter of fact, he
was more broadly and more accurately in-
formed than any book. He had a memory
that was almost superhuman; his literary
appetite was insatiable, and he browsed over
wide pastures. People were to him interest-
ing only in the aggregate; but he had a fine
old-fashioned courtesy for good things and
beautiful; and he reverenced good women and
children. In the last years of his long
life he was out of action owing to shattered
nerves, and his inability to work fretted his
fine spirit and drove him deeper into himself.
He became moody, unsociable and more self-
contained than ever. During that last sad
period, a few little children were his only
friends. Every day he used to wander down
to a seat in Boyal Park and sit there for-
hours. At first he had two child friends
then a whole bevy of youngsters began to look:
on him as their particular chum. He got
happiness out of this; but if- outsiders wan-
dered near, he became uneasv and self-con-
scious, and the charmed circle was broken.
Acquaintances who incautiously approached
were sharply driven off.
He lived all his life unmarried, a niece
keeping house for him. Work was his one
and only love. Syme wanted to pay him
more. “I don’t leant any more,” said Wind-
sor. “I have enough money, and I’ve the
work!” So he continued to burn himself up.
If his paper could have offered him an in-
creased capacity for toil he would have
jumped at the offer.
Dr. Charles Pearson was associated with
him as leader writer; but it was the tireless
editor who wrote Saturday’s leading article.
Striking, vivid, arresting masterpieces they
were, acknowledged everywhere among the
literary men of Australia as a giant’s work.
In the early ’Bo’s, when partv politics meant
party war, he was as a big gun thundering.
During this white-hot period, a large squat-
ter of the Riverina paid Windsor a
towering compliment. The Argus was this
man’s meat and drink, while the Age was
poison to him. But he admitted that he read
his Age for the “tonic of the Saturday lead-
ing article.” “I have the paper sent under
cover,” he said. “I read that article and I
destroy the journal. No one else oh my sta-
tion is allowed to see it. I abhor the -thing !
I will trust no other man to read it I”
Windsor, the quick-brained, was not a mis-
anthrope ; he didn’t lose heart because re-
forms did not arrive in a day, but philosophi-
cally put everything down to the slow work-
ing of evolution, and strove on. He had
studied Man from the misty beginning, and
he and David Syme often waded out into
controversial deeps and fought toe to- toe
where beings of lesser mental stature .would
have been merely “found drowned.” The
two were bosom friends, and the paper’s weal
was the chief concern of both. In those days
big questions needed no conference of part-
ners ; Syme and Windsor just shut them-
selves in together and thrashed it out. From
those momentous two-man conferences every-
thing of importance emanated, and the deci-
sions thus arrived at “went” everyw-here.
Windsor, at one time, allowed his beloved
Origin of Species theory to leak into his
articles ; but the populace would not stand
for it, so Windsor turned it off. He had
qualified for a doctor, and had his M.D. de-
gree. He was a ruddy-haired, broad-shoul-
dered man, not tall, but muscularly heavy
and with particularly fine, sensitive hands..
He would possibly have made a fine physi-
cian, though his habit of telling the whole-
truth very lucidly might have shocked sham ;
patients off his books.
When his health broke, he went wander--
ing abroad; but, back again in Melbourne.,
he haunted the office like a distressed ghost,,
and worked intermittently until he had got
the ultimate column out of himself. Pos-
sibly in all his life in Melbourne his friends:
numbered no more than six or seven all!
told; but that was only because he did not
seek friends. The few who knew him well
found him most human and genial. One
man in particular looks back on a suc-
cession of midnight suppers. _ When the
paper had been put to bed, Windsor would
collect his friends and they would wander
across the road to old Guusler’s Caf6; then
Windsor, off duty and with the satisfying
feeling that he had done his share, would
uncork his sparkling intellect. The mem-
ories of those talks make up a treasury of
golden common sense for the lucky com-
panion of the table.
JOHANNA.
The biggest pantomime in London, “The Sleeping
Beauty,” at Drury Lane, gives another blow to the
Principal Boy tradition. Florence Smithson (Sombra
of “The Arcadians”) is the princess, and the. prince
is Wilfrid Douthitt, an oratorio-singer who lately
drifted on to the stage as Passion, in “Everywoman.

HIS ONLY S ISTER: " You do say such absurd
things , Henry! When that Barker woman
asked you if you had any sisters you said:
‘ Oh , yes, a long string.’ Whatever did
you mean? ”
When the Good Australian rewards go
round there will be a few mostly-overlooked
women due for a share. So far. about the
only limelight they have had is thrown by
Statist Knibbs’s latest Census Bulletin. In
the section dealing with wives who are
mothers of Australian citizens, 49 are quoted
as having had families numbering 21 and
over; there are 27 with 20 children ; 49 with
19 children; 130 with 18; 271 with 17; 674
with 16; 1380 with 15; 2743 with 14; 5358
with 13; 9329 with 12; 13,478 with 11 ; and
20.229 with 10. Of those women who gave
birth to 21 or more, 14 were born in Eng-
land, 11 in N. S. Wales, six in Victoria,
four in Tasmania, four in Ireland, two in
Scotland, and two in Germany. English-
born wives headed the list witli families of
20. There were six of them. Vic-
toria was next with five. Of those with
19 and 18 children to their credit, England
again takes pride of birthplace, with 20 and
31 respectively. N. S. Wales natives top the
list in families of 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11
and 10. The sad feature of the table is the
great number of women who have borne only
one child. There were 105,019 of them—the
highest number of all. Next comes 104,253
women with accredited births of two chil-
dren ; and, of a total of 733,773 wives,
89,064 had rocked no cradle. However, there
are a heap of these to whom the Statute of
Limitations doesn’t yet apply.
The Melbourne Board of Works controls
all _ the sources of water supply, some of
which are in the Fernshaw and Healesville
district, about 30 miles east of the city. In
1901 Queen Mary visited the locality, and
was more or less jubilant to find that a part
was named Marysville. Now she has sent
out a number of acorns to be planted for
oaks at Fernshaw, not far from the sacred
soot. At the last meeting of the Board of
Works a request came from the local Tour-
ist and Progress Association for £6O to be
spent on a kiosk where the royal oaks are
to be planted. A gruff member protested
that the kiosk and oaks would attract
swarms of snobs, who would probably foul
the water supply. Whereat a loyal member
groaned, writhed and exclaimed, almost
wringing his hands : “Oh, dear ! What would
her Majesty say to this?” Against such an
appeal as that, the suggestion that the water
supply of the city might be fouled had, of
course, no weight, and the £6O was voted
by an overwhelming majority of toads.

The Semaphore anchorage off Port Ade-
laide has “laid” an uneasy ghost at last—
the wreck of the Norma. At least one other
ship has piled its bones on hers, and an
uneasiness about fouling them is held re-
sponsible for one or two collisions, including
that which recently carried away the screw-
pile light, and two valuable lives. The

“Briner” : An idea sprang into my mind
this week through seeing Belgian naval
cadets in Melbourne on their way round
the globe for practice. The
Belgian Navy is really a
one-oar’s affair compared
with what the Australian
Navy already is, and still
less compared with what it
will be within a year. So it
will soon be up to us to send
a training ship round the
world, partly to show Tokio,
Hamburg, San Francisco
and London what our naval
cadets are like. It will be
a little stroke for us, just
like the big one made by the
IJ.S. in sending battleships
our way. The Japanese
were very careful to pack a
cadet ship off to Australia
as soon as they were able to
manage it. And as soon as
they could trust an All-
Japanese ship to go round
the world, they sent the
Shilcishama to London,
where it made an enormous
sensation. Even the Rus-
sians, during the tension of
1878, sent the Vestnik, Afri-
ka and Plastoun to Aus-
tralia. . There is more
reason, in' one way, why we
should do the same thing.
We must get young Aus-
tralia to look more to the
sea.. and the prospect of a
cruise to foreign countries
will be an inducement extra
to those mentioned in the advts.
The British India S. N. Co., which follows
the P. and O. Co. as the biggest British firm
trading to Asiatic ports, has purchased the
Currie fleet of steamers. These are among
the largest on the Australian register, and
are husky competitors of the B. I. Co., especi-
ally in the jute trade. The absorption is a
distinct move forward by the 8.1. people
towards the domination of Indian cargo
trade. Archibald Currie, the founder of the
line that bears his name, was chairman of
the Victorian Marine Board for many years.
Another Hellenic tragedy:—
1 hcodoro Dendiros, of Melbourne, erst of one of
the Grecian Isles where burning Sappho loved and
sung,” is a disappointed ' woman. She recently
came to Australia at the solicitation of Panos Booli-
eris, a playmate of her school days, who desired to
marry her. Panos, however, had been some years
away from the Aegean Isle, and Theodora had in
the meantime aged somewhat. So when she ar-
rived he asserted that she was not as beautiful as
she had been, and declined to marry her. There-
u,Pon ns l ,e d a breach of prom se action, and a ver-
dict lor £250 damages, with costs. This looked
NOT CUT THAT LOW.
ETHEL: “I shall never he able to put on even-
ing dress after all this sunburning. ”
MAUD: "But surely your LEGS won't show,
dear! ”
like a tangible solace; but Panos knew a thing
or two, and, the day before the verdict was given,
w S °ien hlS frulCel : er ' s st °ck and outfit and departed
for Athens or thereabouts. When, therefore, the
Proceeded to Panos’s shop, with intent to seize
Ldv S w-H°°H? t 0 sa - tlsfy Theodora’s claim, a strange
lady with the poetic name of Tunks, or something
ordered him off. After that Theodora took out an
interpleader summons, and the law was further
cognisant of the matter, ultimately deciding that
the sale of the concern was genuine, and that
Theodora must whistle for her money—and pay
costs. All of which is most lamentable,' that desir-
able Hellenic damsel being considerably out of
pocket, besides having her reputation for beauty
unduly aspersed. Still, there is an outside chance
that tate has avenged her. The unspeakable Turk
may have caught Boolieris in his haste and dealt it
out to him—though this is unlikely, Boolieris being
evidently a swift person, prone to get away hastily
from danger.
The house-chaser leads a strenuous life
these times. A metropolitan landlord Was
grabbed by an anxious stranger the other
day. "1 want that cottage of yours in Blank
street.” gasped the grabber. "But it’s let to
Dash,” replied the capitalist. "I know,” said
the applicant; “but lie’s just murdered his
wife in the back-room, and been arrested for
murder!” It transpired later that the home-
seeker was only 30 minutes behind the tra-
gedy, and had beaten two others by but 10
and 15 minutes respectively.
Electric street cars without rails, but de-
riving their power from an overhead wire
are to be tried on Sydney branch lines to
Potts Point and Darl-
ing Point. The new
idea may be a good
one or it may not. It
is not going to do
away with unsightly
poles and dust, and ft
remains to be seen if
it will do away to any
extent with noise. Ail
over Britain electric
vehicles with no over-
head attachment, and
running with the
minimum o f noise
smell and dirt, are
fast displacing trams
and the like in popu-
lar favor. But the
trouble with our im-
ported railway men is
nearly always the
same. They don’t ex-
pect to stay in Aus-
tralia. This country
is merely a stepping
stone to a job under
some English or other
foreign railway co.
And the foreign rail-
way co. naturally asks
for nothing more tha"
profits. How has the
candidate done in that
way? So the candi-
date breaks no new
ground, if he can help
it, and does the things
which look a- thorn
they will give the best
return right away—and is 'very often
scarcely civil to die public in the process.
. ” : The King Edward memorial statue
is to be put at the Macquarie-street entrance
to Hyde lark, Sydney, so that we may have
a little family party there. Ardent loyalists
may be interested to know that the spot on
which the Queen Victoria statue stands was
occupied in 1788 by a tree with stout limbs,
and from one of those limbs was dangled the
hrst victim of capital punishment in N.S.W
ihe late Dr. Ilouison and other archive-
searchers fix that as the spot where the
youth Barrett was hanged by the Governor’s
order for having stolen a loaf of bread. While
the pedestal of this Queen Victoria statue
was being placed in position, there lay in
Darlinghurst Gaol a prisoner named Johns,
whose death sentence for attempted murder
was ratified by Loftus, another Governor.
1 lie mother and sister of the convicted man
came to Sydney to plead for a reprieve, but
were unsuccessful. They excited a deal of
popular sympathy, however, and at an open-
aii meeting on the evening before the execu-
tion, the mother of Johns was raised from
the ground by several strong arms and placed
standing on the pedestal. Erom that posi-
tion she made her last vain appeal- Thus
the figure of Queen Victoria was not the first
temale form to crown the pedestal.

LETTER FROM A SELF-MADE SINNER TO HIS
SON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gloom and ennui are the bitterest foes of
Mankind, and against them he constantly strives ;
Fain would I teach you how best to dispose of
The days and the minutes which make up our lives.
It isn t good form to be too pessimistic
(Form should be perfect, though morals be lax) ;
Slay each dull moment by methods artistic,
Never kill time with a club or an axe.
Heed not the voice of the dullard who proses,
Preaching the doctrine that pleasure’s a crime ;
If you must break the commandments of Moses,
See that you only break one at a time.
Strut while you may on the stage of existence,
Carefully posing and playing your part,
Be an apostle of dogged persistence
Rather than slave to the canons of art.
Art is as long as a lane with no turning.
Life, which is short as a ballet girl’s skirt,
Chiefly consists of unsatisfied yearning,
Yearning which harrows the soul to its hurt.
Life is a garden which Death’s hand encloses;
In it fair blossoms in clusters are hung;
Stretch forth both hands, then, and gather its roses
While they are blushing, and while you are young.
Youth can expand like the blossoms and flourish,
Strong in the strength of its powers still divine;
Age craves for viands which strengthen and nourish,
Youth can exist upon kisses and wine.
Empty the cup while the rich wine is creaming,
Time will despoil you of all but the lees ;
Age is a season of fatuous dreaming,
Fate locks the treasures, but youth holds the keys.
When on Eve’s daughters you lavish caresses,
Never let one of them make you her thrall,
Binding you fast to her side with her tresses —
Safety’s in numbers ; make love to them all.
Hearts are but toys, to be broken in pieces,
Girls were invented to flirt with, and so
Never depend on one woman’s caprices,
Always have two or three strings to your bow.
Sip every pleasure, but keep your head level.
Let not one passion your senses enmesh ;
Have an entente cordiale with the Devil,
Keep on good terms with the world and the flesh.

A DAZZLING CAREER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fiis promotion was very rapid. He had only been
in the police force six years when he was raised to
the rank of senior constable. Eight vears later he
was made sergeant. —News item.
Great Scot! To what gay, giddy heights
A constable may climb !
To what ineffable delights
He may attain —in time!
When once a John begins to rise—
Begins to soar and soar—-
He 11 look with absolute surprise
On what he was before.
When once a member of the force
Starts on the upward track,
If he’s a man of keen resource
You’ll never hold him back.
If he’s the right and proper type
Of constable, in ten
Or fifteen years he’ll get a stripe—
You cannot hold him then.
His luck is in: some burglar chap
Will shoot him in the ribs.
And then behold the lucky trap !
Behold liis honored Nibs!
A senior constable js he
With two stripes on his arm !
But eight more years and he may be
A sergeant stout .and calm !
Another dozen years or so
And (if he still survives)
Another step he’ll climb ; and lo!
The hunting-crop' arrives !
A sub-inspector sterji and chaste
The young hedge ,cop affrights,
But many die before they taste
Promotion’s swift delights.

“Bloggs” on meaningless gifts:—
One of the most admirable features of the Chelms-
ford regime was the refusal, last week, of the lady
member of the firm to accept any sort of farewell
presentation. If this sets a fashion, an anomaly will
have been removed from our social life. The presen-
tation habit is one of the most idiotically paradoxical
developments on record. Bank-manager Brown, say,
is being transferred from Dustyton to Mudvil. He
is not hard up. He needs no public endorsement of
the facts that he has behaved himself in Dustyton,
and made the average number of friends. Yet to
such a pitch has the presentation custom or insanity
arrived, that if his friends (and others) were not
blackmailed to give him a silver tea-service or a gold
watch, or a dressing-case, it would be generally
considered that he had been a failure. 1 spent six
months in a backblocks township once. During that
period the following achieved presentations:—
(1) A pub-keeper, on leaving to take charge of a
Sydney pub.
(2) A tobacconist, who, having gone insolvent as
a result of love of beer and hatred of toil, decided to
start as a bookmaker at pony race-meetings.
(3) A farmer, who had a big win at Randwick, and
about the same time sold his place at a high figure,
and thereupon decided to chuck work for life.
(4) A priest steering for another vineyard.
(5) The Golf Club professional who, being gravely
suspected of stealing members’ small change, etc.,
had been privately requested to move on.
An inevitable feature of all these ceremonies is that
the less the recipient needs the more he gets. Thus, a
Governor’s wife, with a private income of her own,
would probably be tendered a string of pearls, while
a popular bankrupt would be lucky if he got away
with a pawnable walking-stick.
While the owners of factories and work-
shops have been obliged by law to provide
their employees with a healthy amount of
breathing space, the clerical work-person has
had no such protection. The man who runs
an office can still dump his clerks, male and
female, into any old cellar, supplied with
nothing but artificial light. Little pokey
rooms, with insufficient space in which to
swing a cat, can therefore be seen any day in
any Australian city crammed with clerks.
The result is that nervous breakdown is com-
mon among this class of worker, especially
those of the female variety, and the trouble
is increasing so much that it has become a
national danger. Nervous breakdown on the
part of office workers supplied Sydney Hospi-
tal alone last year with 197 indoor cases and
600 outdoor patients; and it is safe to say
for every case that went to a public hospital,
at least a dozen were treated privately. The
obvious remedy is to subject offices to exactly
the same legislation as. factories and work-
rooms. The clerks, especially the female
portion of them, are notoriously unorganised,
and are not members of a strong fighting
union which can butt into an election and
play a big part. So they have been left. And
unless they organise, it looks as though they
will continue to be left.
THE REPLY ARTFUL.
THE TEALOUS HE: “I call your
‘ dear young doctor ’ a quack!"
THE PROPITIATING S HE: “Of course, dear. I
said he was a duck."
Df the second batch of 33 Australian
youths just admitted to the Military College
at Duntroon, eight are from N.S.W., three
each from Tassy and South Aus.; one from
Bananaland ; and no less than 18 from Vic-
toria. Westralia, which supplies none at all,
is, in most things, good Australian —there is
none better—but wages are high and work
plentiful in that State; and a “military
career evidently makes no appeal yet to
the local youngster.
According to the last census, the oldest
married woman in Australia was something
between 95 and 99. Her husband was JT
or less. Sixteen wives whose ages are be-
tween 90 and 94 have husbands under 84.
At the .other end of the proceedings, two
wives of 16 have husbands over 50, and one
wife between 25 and 29 has a husband over
90. Husbands and wives who live to ex-
treme old age do not figure among those who
have a phenomenal number of children; blit
one husband and two wives whose ages are
less than 44 have 21 children or over. And
four girls of 17 have made a fair start to put
up the same kind of record by already ac-
cumulating three children each.
Melbourne Labor Council protests against
Defence Minister Pearce allowing the cadets
of alleged superior schools, like the Mel-
bourne Church of England, Scotch and Wes-
ley colleges, to have their own drills reckoned
as officially good. There is a nice point here,
and one which must be settled definitely if
the Australian citizen army is to be the real
thing. Of course Mrs. Toorak objects to her
Percy drilling with common boys, and even
Mrs. Smith feels strongly, on the subject of
Johnny associating, even in the ranks, with
Billy Jones ; but it will be a poor business
if the prejudices of these good ladies are al-
lowed to create a system of caste which will
differentiate corps from corps and regiment
from regiment. Mrs. Toorak would natur-
ally like Percy to be an officer, but poor
Percy hasn’t any brains to speak of and can t
be ; and, indeed, it is reasonably probable that
Billy Jones may yet issue orders to both
Johnny and Percy. This being so, Mrs.
Toorak’s only refuge for her nice boy who is
not to mix with common Australian citizens
would be a regiment composed entirelv ot
nice boys, which would drill, train and fight
all on its superior own. Existing legislation
intended nothing of this kind; but Mrs.
Toorak manages somehow to secure a big
pull socially on stout Labor democrats when
they get into office, and that social pull may
vet make our defence system a weaker thi g
than it is. It is up to Pearce to mention
the fact firmly, but in a gentle voice, that
Percy and all his kind must step into the
rank's and serve their country exactly as
Johnny and Billy do. There is no hardship
in this The Australian citizen army will
have a levelling influence but under ge spur
of wholesome patriotism it wdlbeaevelhng
nn Percy’s superiority will not suiter, n
there is any of the article in his composition,
but humbug will receive little consideration,
and Mrs Toorak may yet be astonished to
tod £ a manly lad Percy realU is since
he took his place in Billy squad. #

There is a young man at Geelong who
ought to take a Tatt.’s ticket or a wife while
his luck is'in. Driving a couple of horses
and a waggonette along a country road on a
dark night, he suddenly met one of Fitz-
patrick’s trains doing a 38-mile-an-hour
sprint. It hit the turn-out, killed both horses,
smashed the waggonette to splinters, and
gave the surprised young man a joy-ride for
60 yards on the cowcatcher of the engine.
And all he got besides was one small scratch.
“A.J.C.,” who has just been through the
mill: —
The Child Study Association waited on Premier
McGowen, of N.S.W., the other day, and pointed
out to him that it was increasingly difficult to get
good milk for infants in Sydney. The usual vague
promises were, made in reply. But isn’t it time
this alleged Socialistic Government of N. S. Wales
did something to prove that it really has some
claim to the title? Private Enterprise may be
able to supply good milk for infants, as the Tele-
graph asserts, but it certainly doesn t do so in the
mass. The pasteurised milk of commerce is unfit
for infantile consumption, and the iced milk of the
carts is as bad. What is required is fresh dairy milk
from healthy cows, produced under special condi-
tions. It is” all very well for a reporter to scour
the city and write that he found at least one
dairyman who could supply such milk. The average
man has absolutely no hope of getting in touch
witn sucn dairies, if they exist. Thev do not adver-
tise, and there is no bureau of information which
will tell anxious parents where such milk can be
obtained. Not only ought there to be an adequate
s , 1 .ply of such miik, but the sources from which it
can be obtained should be as easy to find as the
post office. The consequent saving of child life
would be immense; and it is more logical for the
State to spend thousands of pounds in starting such
dairy farms and distributing agencies than to splash
it on importing more or less tainted armies ot
immigrant’s. Of course the best food for an infant
is that supplied by the mother ; but there are, unfor-
tunately, thousands of mothers who are unable to
meet the need. Under existing circumstances the
babes of those mothers are seriously handicapped,
and if they live, are almost inevitablv doomed to be
inferior physically and mentally to those who have
had the inestimable boon of natural food, lo sup
pfy the next best thing, that State or municipal
dairy is necessary, and must come. #
“Sub Rosa”: The Education Department
of South Aus. is in a ferment. When the
present director assumed office “promotion
by merit” came into force. It s a first-rate
rule, only unfortunately it opens wide the
door for favoritism, or suspected favoritism,
which is almost as upsetting. The teachers
are divided into two classes, those who know
the Director and those who don t. Inose
in the second class rightly or wrongly think
they have small chance of getting out ot the
ruck. When an appointment is made the
usual question put by this class is, Comes
from Moonta, I suppose? rhe Director
came from Moonta. No doubt from the
worry of it all. the present Director is a
wreck, and for his own sake as well as the
Department’s, it is to be hoped the Govern-
ment will put the direction into the hands
of a board of three. That would remove the
present bogey (or whatever it is) of favori-
tism from the premises. If it isn t done,
something is going to break, and that always
means a mess to be cleaned up.
The Old Soldier voices a theory:—
There is an outcry about imported timber bein'*
used at Cockatoo Dock for the fittings of Australian
warships. But why should wooden fittings be used
at all ? We all know that when ships go into action
the wooden linings and bulkheads of the cabins,
together with every other inflammable article in the
ship, from the captain’s furniture to the photo of the
smallest middy’s best girl, will immediately be thrown
overboard. Broadly speaking, wherever wood is
now used metal would do as well, if not better,
since it would be both lighter and stronger—a
serious consideration in warship construction. The
dockyard tradition that cabin-fittings must be made
of wood is a senseless inheritance from the days
of wooden ships and smoothbore guns, whose pro:ec-
tiles were far less destructive than those of to-day.
Down with wood, imported and otherwise, and up
with aluminium and steel!

The most biting criticism of the new

within the service. A country postmaster in

are they !” and he gleefully surcharged each
one twopence.

The Oldest Inhabitant parts with another
friend: —
A house which has stood for 90 years in Elizabeth -
street, at the south-west corner of Hyde Park, is
being levelled to make room for a Mark Foy building.
From 1816 until 1825 Judge Wylde—he was a Judge
of the Supreme Court as constituted before the Char-
ter of Justice —lived in it Probably he built it. This
Wylde had a grant of 11 acres at the extreme end
of Macleav-street, ground originally reserved by Gov-
ernor Phillip for the use of the aborigines. He sold
to J. H. Potts, who was accountant to the Bank of
New South Wales. Hence Potts Point. Wylde was
afterwards Chief Justice at the Cape of Good Hope,
where he died in 1859. At one time Mortimer W.
Lewis, Colonial Architect, resided in the Elizabeth-
street house, and for a great number of years it was
the home of James Wright, a brewer, whose vats were
on the corner (S.E.) of Bathurst and George streets.
If the Australian really has a sense of
humor, some of him must have grinned ironi-
cally recently when EJ. N. Sloman, the new
headmaster whom the Sydney Grammar
School has thought it necessary 'to import
in the good old fashion, was picking a fare-
well chop in London. Among the valedic-
tory bone-pickers were 22 ex-Grammar
School students earning a crust in England,
presumably because their own country
(which includes their own school) hadn’t a
crumb for them. If any humorist of them
all unobtrusively dropped a sardonic chuckle
into the tomato sauce, the situation certainly
provided an excuse.

IT was a mild young man that met

And as a gallant youth he set
About to please the ancient maid.
They twittered for an hour or so.
And then he took her for a row.
They met again by happy chance.
His arm was round her waist this time.
It happened at a little dance.
And so the cuddle was no crime;
But she just grabbed the lad when he
Said, “ Sarah, will you fly with me ? ”
She smiled and softly murmured,.“Nay,
There is no need to fly, my dear.-.
lam an orphan. None can stay
My wishes. We can marry here.”
“ Great Scot! ” he gasped, “you’ve not quite caught
My meaning. I’m an aeronaut.”

ABORIGIN-

“Fritz” : Some of our native insects have
acquired the craze for imports in a marked degree.
For instance, the vine moth used to feed exclusively
on the gum mistletoe, but since the introduction of
the grape vine and Virginian creeper it has left the
mistletoe alone, and now feeds on the other two
plants. One result of the change is that the mistletoe
is spreading rapidly through the Victorian bush —so
rapidly, indeed, that it has been proclaimed a weed
under the Thistle Act.
“Gee-Gee”: Brief for counsel to advise
in re Timothy Finnerty. This was a simple case of
drunkenness. Timothy was found (according to the
evidence for the prosecution) lying across the foot-
path in the main street at Parkes (N.S.W.), “dead
tight.” The season being New Year, the constable
charitably placed Timothy on his feet several times ;
but Timothy was topheavy, and it was apparent that
the only place for Timothy was in His Majesty’s care.
Now, Timothy was in due course called upon to “an-
swer the charge.” He denied absolutely and indig-
nantly the drunkenness, and justified his indignation
by explaining that he was a laborer workin’ out on
Mclntosh the solicitor's farm, and was in the habit
of going to sleep about two o’clock and sleeping all
the afternoon. “Ye see, yer Honor,” he stated, “I
just sat down on the footpath and went to sleep.” The
magistrate, without comment, fined accused £2. Will
counsel for the Abo-liars please advise—
(l) Whether Timothy Finnerty has sufficient
grounds on which to appeal against such conviction ;
and particularly—-
(2) Whether Finnerty would be justified in sub-
mitting his case to the immigration authorities for
publication as an inducement for laborers to come to
this country ; and —
(3) What amount Finnerty should charge the im-
migration authorities for such right of publication ?

“Fritz” : If any rooster is anxious to tell
me something about snake hybrids let him stand
forth and crow. I’m led to make this announce-
ment by the fact that a new edition of serpent has
appeared along the Murray between Swan Hill and
Mildura (Vic.). It has ruddy blotches on the back,
and is from 2ft. to 3ft. long. I’ve classified it as
a black and carpet snake hybrid, pending further
evidence.
“Jam Tin” : Can any accredited Austra-
lian produce a genuine instance of moon-blindness?
1 have heard of several cases from blokes who were
told by coves, but I've never been able to trace the
coves. In one of his books Frank T. Bullen mentions
the affliction, but, despite Bullen’s reputation, I
doubt the narrative. The reason I ask is because
I’m sleeping in the open, and I don’t want to have
my lights doused.
“Leo Lear”: Talking about fences (don't
know that anybody was talking about them, but it’s
all the same), those in which logs were the basic
principle have mostly disappeared under the flame
of bush fires and the flat of rabbit inspectors. The
most picturesque was the chock-and-log, which may
still be seen criss-crossing over the landscape in
parts of the Upper Murray. Another favorite barri-
cade with spars was the dog-leg fence, now extinct
except in deserted corners. But for everyday pur-
poses no stile was more common, where timber was
plentiful, than logs heaped together and piled on
one another. This had the double advantage of
clearing the land and providing a barrier at the
same time. There are places in the Wannon (Vic.)
where fences were made of sods. Into these the
rabbits entered with a shout of joy visible miles out
to sea, until they were blasted out with equal pro-
portions of powder and language. But of all the
constructions that the early comers built, the stone
walls of the volcanic belts are the most lasting, solid
and infernal rabbit residences extant. Built with a
base of 4ft., and sft. 6in. high, at a cost of from £1
to £1 ss. a chain, it now runs the owners into five bob
a chain to pull the thing down, and then £6O or so a
mile to replace with wire netting. Where good tim-
ber was plentiful, the old timers with the tidy
habit favored the post and three railer, another
costly edifice which is not now used. This obstruc-
tion has been known to last 60 years.

“S.R.”: The immigrant can settle down
to it—sometimes. Two youthful and inexperienced
Londoners, stranded in Sydney through a blind faith
in immigration agents, last June wandered towards
Israel with their payable property, and then trained
it to Wagga. From Wagga they tramped without
blankets to Yanco, 70-odd miles, doing the pad in
three days. They had one pay to collect, when the
big July rain caused a shortening of hands, and
after silencing the hash-house, their joint capital ran
to a blanket apiece and two spins in the two-up ring.
Then they “joined the troupe,” and “broke down
the River” to get a shed. They had no idea of
what “the troupe,” “breaking down the river,” or
“getting a shed” signified, but they preferred the
whole of them, with their accumulated possibilities,
to hanging round the works, sponging on boardin
house keepers. They tramped, without getting work,
through Kooba, Tubbo, Kerarbury, Benerembah, Brin-
gagee and Wyvern, and back to Narandera, Lockhart
and Corowa. When they did eventually snap a joi»on
a Murray station, they heard complaints regarding
wages, tucker, accommodation, the jackeroo, and
sundry minor details, and they suggested a deputa-
tion as the most likely method of obtaining redress.
Two others, besides themselves, out of a total of
13, lined up, and they were all promptly sack'
They are beside me now, camped waiting for the
fruit, and one of them has so far adapted himself
to his surroundings that he has promised to “hum”
a stamp to post this at the first town we strike.
“Gouger”: The camel’s internal machin-
ery is a marvellous defier of hard times, but it is
not proof against some of the* tucker on the Aus-
tralian tracks. In one camp at Normanhv, ’way out
behind Cooktown (Q.), I saw 36
camels that had died in one night
through eating the new green
leaves of the ironwood tree. Like-
wise, the guttapercha plant is
sudden death to the four-legged
ship of the desert as well as
horses ; and the peach plant is in
the same catalogue. Still, it is
not as deadly as the far-famed
Darling pea. Animals have been
known to recover from the mad-
ness that follows a pea feast, but
horses, anyhow, are seldom any
use afterwards. I reckon the goat
to be the toughest inhabitant of
the continent, but there is a plant
like an ordinary lily up on York
Peninsula that disturbs his works.
A leaf of this vegetable, if crushed
in the hand, produces a juice
which causes instant and violent
burning. Saw a William goat do
some high and lofty tumbling
after chewing a leaf, and, with
terrifying howls, bolt for the near-
est waterhole. Don’t know the
name of the plant, or I’d post
it so that you could add it to the list of undesir-
ables.

“Kim”: Peter called upon the local ser-
geant one day with a complaint that his fence had
been burned down by his neighbor, Hore Maori. The
sergeant accosted Hore thus: “What’s this Peter
come tell me, you burn his fence down, eh ?” “Yes,
I burn his fence down. Next time I burn his blirrv
whare down!” “By jingo, Hore, you go to gaol.”
“No blirrv fear. I tell you why I burn his fence.
Sometimes ago I go ’way. While I ’way Peter he
steal my missus. I no care ’bout the missus—she no
good; but when he get the missus she wearin’ my
daughter’s jacket, and I pay two pound for that
jacket in Oamaru. I go to Peter; I say, ‘Keep te
missus, but give me te jacket.’ Peter say, ‘No.’ So
I burn his blirry fence down. Inogo to gaol.”
A LENGTHY SPREE.
“I (hie) ought to know whash I'm talking about. Eve been in thish State for to ( hie) years."
“Gouger”: A slimy pest in the Queens-
land scrubs during the rainy months is the leech.
About an inch and a half long, and black in color,
the blood-sucker hangs on to a man’s leg with a
tenacity that would do credit to a bull-hound. They
have literally to be torn from their prey. Lathering
legs and feet with a thick layer of soap is about the
only remedy for the scrub leech, unless you keep
out of the scrub. I’ll do that if anybody will get
me a job in town. Anything’ll do except being an
editor. I couldn’t stand loafing all the time.
ANOTHER RELAPSE.
DOCTOR: “Did you give him the rhubarb I
ordered?”
WIFE: “Yes, doctor .”
D OCTOR: “How did you give it?”
W IFE: “in a pie."
“Inchiquin” : Re long journeys by horses.
Owned a flea-bitten half-bred Arab that did some good
trips in his day, and lived to the age of 23. He was
owned previously by two Queensland tank-sinkers.
Every second Tuesday, about 10 p.m., one of them
would start off for the mail, 60 miles away. After
two hours’ spell he would tackle the return journey,
and be between the blankets by midnight of Wednes-
day. I afterwards raced the horse once at Kangaroo
Island, and he could have won easily, but threw his
rider after getting the lead.
“Tiaki” : In Maoriland such trees as the
tawa and the honeysuckle are noted splitters, and, in
many cases will “fly up the back” (i.e., split up the
back “scarf” without breaking across the stump),
and woe betide the man who gets a lift from the fly-
ing timber. He ceases to take any interest in bush
contracts. I knew one poor fellow who was letting
down a drive of trees among which were a number of
tawas. He was standing well in the rear, to be out
of danger, when a slab of white tawa flew out from
among the smashing, grinding mass of timber and
pinned him through the body. It was the odd chance
in a million, and it happened. Another victim lobbed
a long red pine in the fork of a standing hinau. Its
impetus balanced it for a
moment, then the heavy butt
brought it shooting back, and
it neatly cut him in two.
Honeysuckle nearly always
leans up hill, and is influenced
by the wind. It is smooth-
barked, and its branches are
spare; so, if the hill is steep
and it “goes up,” it generally
glides back again like the
Devil’s battering ram. One
poor bushman got nailed to a
stump by one of these back-
sliders, and, although he was
fatally injured, he smoked a
cigarette and made out his
will (in pencil) in the pre-
sence of his mates. “I know
what’ll happen when you cut
off a length,” he said grimly.
“As soon as the air gets to
me I’m gone.” He was right.
I knew one bushie who put
his head in the back scarf of
a tawa to hear if it was crack-
ing. It was, and he idled the
next six months in a hospital.
The most awful death I’ve
met was that of a Maori. He
had sawn a huge kauri tree,
and then wedged it from the
back scarf, but some of the
big timber is so straight that
enough wedges cannot be
“banked” in behind to over-
balance it. Henare had
placed his pipe under the butt
on the stump and gone down
to the camp, which was shift-
ing for a tangi. He went
back to the tree to get his
pipe. Three days later his
absence at the tangi was com-
mented on. Returning to the
bush, his mates found him
dead, with one hand jambed
under the stump. The tree
had “ridden on its stump”
(i.e., tilted sideways a little) just as he was about
to withdraw his pipe. In his efforts to escape he had
gnawed the arm to the bone.
“W’lang”: Re the country policeman (B.
26/12/’l2). There was one in a mining township
in Vic. who had never been known to make an arrest.
One day a man wandered along with snakes in his
hair. Jonnop took pity on him, locked him up,
bought a bottle of brandy for the good of his nerves,
and, when asking the Jay to deal with him, leniently
said he was a decent fellow, but got too much
drink. Discharged with a caution. The Jonnop gave
his late guest some good advice and half a crown.
The late guest was very grateful; and, as he had no
swag and nowhere to sleep, he asked permission to
occupy the same room till next day. Request granted.
The guest gave no trouble: he left early in the
morning, and took the blankets with him. It isn’t
safe to slip in the mud in view of that Jonnop
now.
A FRAUD.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
The guile of humble mendicants
Who beg of you a sprat for bread
Is terrible. So portly gents.
In self-defence have often said.
They give no more, because they think
The penny’s always spent in drink.
’Tis true the beggars lie like fun.
And I am moved indignantly
To tell a simple tale of one
Who worked a shocking fraud on me.
He wrecked .vhat little faith I’d left
In men forlorn, bereaved, bereft.
He came to me, a pallid wretch,
With trembling limb and woeful eye.
He wept a minute at a stretch,
And “Charity” was all his cry.
“For Gorsake, mister, stay and hear,
And spare a bloke a bob for beer!”
For want of beer he’d nearly died.
I gave him coppers, and he ran.
I followed him, and stood and spied
In indignation while the man
To Brown, the baker, slyly sped,
And spent my hard-earned browns on bread !

“Flinderino” : Mrs. I‘ete? Spiller, of Run-
ning Creek, was always fond of children, and as a
child she used to borrow other people’s youngsters
to nurse. AVhen she married Peter the people on the
creek told each other what a happy mother she would
make, and how her mug of joy would slop over when
the stork paid its initial visit- to the Spiller humpy.
However, time passed by and no stork or native
companion showed up. The crestfallen Airs. Spiller
confidentially informed Airs. Jones that Peter re-
fused to consent to a visit from the long-legged bird.
Peter could not entertain the idea until the house
had been paid off, and there were four more years to
go. When the four years were up and the house be-
came their own, Mrs. Spiller brightened up wonder-
fully and became her old self once more. But, alas!
the joys of anticipation were short-lived. AA-ith sad-
ness i:.i her voice and a lump in her throat, she told
Mrs. .’ones that Peter said babies could not yet, be
tlir -ht of, as the house wanted painting first.
“ ! 'iouger”: The blacks of the N.Q. coast
are ■ pert catchers of the dugong, so much prized for
its oil, and fish for them from dug-out canoes. Alostly
the f: king is done at night, for it is by the dis-
turbance in the phosphorescence on the sea that
Bingh: loca, his prey. The canoe silently glides
from shore under the noiseless but skilful handling
of the paddle. In the prow stands a dark shadow-
like figure, armed with a long pole, in the end of
which is a short three-pronged harpoon. To the har-
poon is attached a strongly-plaited cord, which, in
turn, is fixed securely to the canoe. The harpoon and
pole are only loosely spliced together, and tear apart
the moment anything is struck. AVhen right over the
unsuspecting fish, the man in the bow, putting all
his available avoirdupois on his pole, leaps upon
brother dugong. Next instant a dark arm has gripped
the stern of the canoe and the outfit is- being torn
through the water by the pain-maddened fish. But
this part of the performance is merely a matter of
time, and is superseded by the boat crew towing the
erstwhile tow-er. Meanwhile the fires have been
lighted ashore, and when the fishermen arrive with
the bacon (which often weighs scwt. or 6cwt.) the
proceedings are nearly as joyous as on a recent Satur-
day when a hilarious tribe of Sydney aborigines
pushed ’Enley, M.L.A., through his hat” on the old
camping ground of the Governor-General.
THE CERTIFICATE TEST, 1920.
“Stolir Ruddell” : Binghi is the boss, per-
son of a two-up ring, not as a reckless gambler, but
as an expert spinner. To anyone who has never
tried, it looks the simplest of operations to make
two pennies twist furiously in the air; yet fe\
of the thousands of habitual “swi-up” players I
have seen can spin decently without violently
swinging the arm. Binghi takes to it as he takes
to gohanna, using only his wrist. And he loves it.
I have seen him in shearing sheds and on public
works eschew hazards, where there was big money,
to spin for pennies, or for the mere fascination of
“sending ’em up” if no pennies or players were
available. AA hen he does take to it as a profession
he’s a weirdly undetectable “nob flier,” and runs
risks which would end in serious disablement for
AVhite Brother.
TI T E PROUD ECONOMIST.
DOOLAN : “Sure [?]is meselt that never thought Mary
Ann's fashionable ould hat would come in so handy."
“Thomas Butler”: It is quite a mistake
to say that the barramundi frequents only the Daw-
son River. I have caught him in the Palmer River
below Mavtown (N.Q.), and know that he is a resi-
dent of the Mitchell, Walsh, Tate, Lynn, Kennedy
and (I believe) the Laura and Endeavor Rivers.
A recent contributor to the “Abo.” pages stated that
the fish makes a most delicious dish. I suppose
it depends upon individual taste. Personally I
would sooner have a black bream any day. *.

“P.A.Q.” : Henare Maori is a serious cuss.
Have you ever noticed him shake hands ? I’ve seen
him meet half a dozen acquaintances in a bunch,
shake hands with the lot, and pass on without a mur-
mur or the trace of a smile. But that’s not the story.
At the Alanawatu Agricultural Show last month, a
raucous-voiced showman was explaining in front of a
small tent that he had on view a “Burlesque AVild
Man.” Being inter-
ested in Darwinism, I
paid the required tan-
ner and went in. The
AVild Alan turned out
to be an ordinary cove
done up for the oc-
casion with horsehair
and grease paint. I
saw the joke when I
remembered that the
bloque in front had
said ■ it was a bur-
lesque. Not so He-
nare. Three of him
came out with me,
muttering “Too much
t e dam humbug.”
They walked round the
outside of the tent to
where a bulge dis-
closed the whereabouts
of the AVild Man, and
at this bulge one of
them directed a 10-
h.p. kick- which, judg-
ing from the commotion inside the tent, got home.
A hurried departure then took .place, though Henare
had time to remark, “By golly, I bet he te wild man
now all right.”
“The Rook” : The wild tobacco plant can
be one' of the most infernal of our .noxious. weeds
when it likes. Lake Victoria Station, on the Mur-
ray, 50 miles t’other side of AVentworth, has had
thousands of acres rendered useless by this pest.
AVhen I first went there, in 1889, there were only two
small bushes of it (growing at the old Lake Vic-
toria pub, long since demolished), but inside five
years, thousands of acres were covered. No grass
grows amongst it worth mentioning, and nothing
will eat it; and its whiskers are so thick that it
takes a rabbit all his time to get through them.
Don’t know where it originally came from ; some
say sheep brought it from South Aus., but whoever
is responsible ought to have it growing on his
grandmother’s grave.
“Edclyson”: Mailing was one of an
assorted party that went camping near Donna Buang
(Vic.) this Christmas. Mailing is a patient soul
who will spend long, sad, silent hours at the end of
a Me, waiting for fish to come out and bite him,
while others are toying in the shade or climbing
the rugged heights. When so employed on the second
day, Mailing caught a fine fat eel. It was his first
success, and it would not have happened had he not
been fishing for black fish. Mailing took his prize
to. the deserted camp, coiled it on a dish, and put it
in the perforated zinc, safe. swung under a sapling.
Fired with his victory, the angler then voyaged up-
stream, found a nice hole, and sat for five dead hours
in anticipation of further adventures. He returned
to camp, weary of everything but fishing. The camp
was still deserted. It was in a state of great dis-
order. Things were thrown about. The meat safe
was down and out, and looked as if it had been
walked on by elephants and laden camels; but the
most damaged and deteriorated item in sight was
Mailing’s eel. It lay in segments, and every section
was battered into the subsoil. The sticks and stones
with which the assault had been committed lay thick
about. The trap and horses were gone; everybody
was gone. There came no reply to. such inquiries as
Mailing addressed to the desert and the range. In
the absence of eel stew, Mailing did his best with
cold duck, tinned pudding, and asparagus fresh from
the can. Then he smoked and waited and wondered.
On towards midnight ten-twelfths of the camping
party returned in the drag. Mailing gathered a few
important facts from the general flow *of explanation.
Poor Roper had been bitten by a snake—terriblv
bitten. It almost appeared that the snake had got
Roper down, and was worrying him, when Tve got
in his first belt with a large piece of a tree! The
blow damaged Roper somewhat, but was important
inasmuch as it quite disconcerted the snake. Then
■Wells hit the snake five times with a pan, and Bol-
ster contributed serious injuries with an axe. The
rest of the picnic threw, rocks and timber at the by-
this-time wholly discomfited reptile, and then com-
mon attention was turned to Roper, who was writh-
ing in mental and physical anguish. Roper had two
punctures in his thumb. The party recognised that
hasty measures were essential to the saving of a
bright , young life. AVith great- readiness of mind
Bolster offered to cut off the offending thumb there
and then. But Tye and AA’ells counselled less drastic
measures. They pulled a cord ligature about Roper’s
wrist- that nearly amputated his hand, and then ran
the victim of the serpent’s guile nine miles to the
township. Roper ran at the back of the drag. They
gave him all the camp whisky to put him to sleep,
and banged all the camp tin-ware in his ears all the
way to keep him awake. At a wayside farm house
they bought more whisky. Roper was now in the
hands of the township doctor, and the camp was
pleased to inform Mailing that if he did not die of
alcoholic poisoning he would probably live to a
green old age, thanks to the prompt actions of his
friends. “AVhere was the snake?” asked Mailing
“It was in the meat safe,” said Tye. “Here are
some bits of it.” He dug fragments of eel from the
moist earth. Mailing did not enlighten them.* He
did not think it would be judicious. He merely
found out for his own satisfaction that Roper
had jabbed himself with the fork with which he had
intended to prod certain meats—an inadvertence due
to the excitement of discovering a venomous serpent
squirming m the safe.
“A.E.8.W.”: About 20 years ago, when
camped near the old barge which then did duty as
a ferry landing stage at Mosman’s, in Sydney Har-
Lor, a boat party of us witnessed a family disturb-
ance, in comparison with which the commotion
caused by a twin-screw steamer’s propellers ; s a
dead calm. It appeared as though there had been
some dispute over property or a girl, and as the
corroboree got warmer, pieces of what looked like
shell-incrusted garden hose and motor tyres with
clinker adhering to them flew in all directions.
There were no signs of gore; yet when the blue
nose came to the surface of the water it looked as
though he had been through an explosion at a pre-
historic factory. Next day we discovered on the
rocks the virtually legless body of an octopus. It
was about the size and shape of an average man’s
body, and the mouth strongly resembled an abnormal
human navel. (It is nose and mouth combined.)
The eyes, which were located where a man’s breasts
would be, were about as large as an ordinary cup,
and had the AVowser expression. We guessed then
that the shark had been declared the winner on a
knock-out.
* * * *
“E.S.S.” takes a snapshot of the way
some of the big estates were built up:—
Jimmy Daylight was a selector, dummying a C.P.
for the boss of the station —the big man’s way of
grabbing a freehold that he couldn’t get bv fair
means. Naturally Jimmy hardly lived on his" selec-
tion at all, merely camping a night in the hut
occasionally. He was kept well posted as to the
movements of the inspector, and it was only when
the official was in the district that Jimmy \vas at
home.
On one occasion the inspector arrived in the neigh-
borhood unexpectedly, and Jimmy had only a few
hours’ notice to get into residence. The place had
been untenanted so long that grass was growing in
the hut, and was knee-rleep all round it. The “cocka-
too” yard wore a deserted appearance. On arrival
Jimmy did some rapid circus tricks around it on
horseback, shut up a mob of cattle to tramp it
down, and penned a lot of strange calves. Then he
built a big fire in the hut to make an ash-heap, and
while this was burning he tidied up inside, cut the
grass away from around the outer walls and drew a
load of wood he didn’t want. He chipped a path
from the door to the yard and another to the water-
hole, and he was trotting a draught horse up and
down to give them a worn appearance when the in-
spector arrived.
Jimmy had hardly breath enough left to say “Good
day”; he had never worked so hard in his life be-
fore. Being caught unawares, he pretended to be
hreaking-in, and said “AA’hoa, boy!’’ soothingly to
the horse whenever it moved, which it did only when
he pinched it or pricked, it.
“Pretty old to he breaking-in, isn’t he?” said the
inspector.
“He was broke in before,’ Jimmy admitted, “but
he’s been running in the bush with the brumbies and
got unmanageable.”
“Been doing a bit of fanning here?” looking at
the cut-up grass along the paths which Jimmy hadn’t
had time to clear away.
“The grass is a nuisance in wet weather, hangin’
over the paths,” Jimmy explained.
“Ye-es,” said the inspector, doubtfullv. “Rather
long since we had any rain, thodgh.”
Jimmy searched the skv for a friendly cloud. “I
was expectin’ some,” he said. “My corns was
troublin’ me terrible this mornin’.”
I’ho visitor inspected Jimmy’s premises with a
suspicious eye, and asked how often he slept there,
and what he worked at. But James knew his
business—which just then was to be a fluent liar.
So, as usual,, all that happened was a caution to be
at home a bit more frequently in future.
THE HUMILIA7ION OF IT.
COCKY (to relation from town): "How much
do you. get at the bank, Charey? ”
C HARLEY: “ Thirty shillings a week.”
C OCKY: "And yer tucker ?”
‘B. de Burke”.: Mrs. Robarts has been
assuring the Ass. for the Advancement of Science
that while the sight of Black Brother is very keen,
his sense of smell is undeveloped, “as he is able to
sit, apparently with perfect comfort, amid the most
objectionable odors.” A long experience of the nig.
has taught me that his sense of smell is perfect. lie
can stand any kind of smell, from the odor of sanc-
tity upwards, being apparently utterly indifferent to
all varieties. Alore, he can distinguish every separate
smell, if he smells a dozen at once. A black tracker
gets his living by smell as much as by sight; and if
you took one to Footscray he could tell vou after a
week’s smelling-round the source and identity of
every stink. This applies at any rate to Victoria
(northern), N. S. AVales and Queensland blacks.
Also, if you and they are moving towards a corpse,
they can pick up and classify a smell some hundreds
of yards before a white man can detect it. Their in-
difference to stinks I attribute to the fact that they
carry so many about with them. A tracker who can
stand the smell of himself after he has hustled for an
hour on a hot day can put up with any sort of in-
suit to his nostrils.
THE SACRIFICE TO COW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Let others sing of war’s alarms;
The heroes of the hour endow
AA ith medals, cheers and limelight charms —
I rise to glorify the Cow.
Some nations pledge their souls to God;
Some kneel before the Sun and bow ;
Some scourge themselves with whip and
We sacrifice our young to Cow.
Not with the knife we end their days ;
Not one swift pain to pale the brow.
No ; ours a creed that, ere it slays,
Gives years-long homage to the Cow.
Long ere the dawn has fringed the sky
Aon boy and girl’s had sleep enow.
Up ! Though the lids cling o’er the eye,

Australian artist George Coates and his
wife, who used to be Dora Meeson (and still
is for professional art-purposes), are coming
home in May or thereabouts with a cargo of
pictures. Mrs. Coates devotes herself largely
to poster-work nowadays.
W. J. Miles, the extraordinarily pertina-
cious man who has been fighting the Sydney
Meat Preserving Co. through court after
court, and was lately felled by a majority
decision of the High Court, isn’t finished

gone to England on the Coal Vend appeal
case, is to ask the Privy Council for leave
to appeal in the Miles matter also.
In the obituaries of Arthur Lloyd Wind-
sor there has been no mention of the ex-AGE
editor s deep-rooted aversion to being asso-
ciated with uneducated, coarse-grained folk
even in public vehicles. The Victorian
champion of Democracy and the Working
Man was exclusive as well as reclusive. His
political sympathies conflicted with his in-
dividual tastes, and he made no concession
to them in his m&nner of life. Wh&t time
he was battling for Labor he lived in Col-
i ins-street, that he might be able to walk to
the office. Tram and train travelling was
almost abominable to him on account of the
people with whom a daily traveller rubs
shoulders. After his retirement, in 1900,
he lived at Park-street. Brunswick, and in
the big open space of lioyal Park he found
the solitude that was congenial to him.

A line from a Water-Crank:—
I put none of Alfred Deakin’s achievements ahead
of Ins services to Australia in the matter of irri
Station. Hugh McColl, of “canawl” fame, converted
the eloquent Deakin when he was a young man
As far back as 1884 Alfred presided over a Commis-
sion on Mater Supply. This created a new interest
in irrigation. He visited semi-arid and arid
America, and set to work to apply to identical condi-
tions identical propositions. He temporarily failed
primarily for lack of “head and water,” the master-
reservoirs in the catchment areas not being built.
A n jmpecuniosity prevailed, notably in brain power!
at the time (late 80’s). And, in the second place,
the distributing channels ran through large estates,
the owners of which were too purse-proud and fat
and too lazy to use the water, and too mean to
paw the water. rates.. Since then, however, closer
settlement and irrigation have been made twins, and
many big estates have thrown in their marbles. All
the water-conservation and d’stributing schemes in
Victoria were really born in 1884, and their present
success and promise of greater success can be traced
to the pioneering of Alfred Deakin.
A FASHION NOTE.

Melbourne’s first photographer was G. B.
Goodman, who, in August, 1845, had a studio
for daguerreotype in Little Flinders-street.
He guaranteed that the sitting would not
exceed five seconds, and the whole picture
would be finished and delivered in four
minutes. The price of each picture (framed)
was one guinea. After being in business
four months, and taking £B7O in cash, Mr.
Goodman unexpectedly, one summer morning,
packed up his “studio” and left for Adelaide.
N. E. Lewis, whose resignation from the
Tasmanian House of Assembly (with that
of Speaker Davies) precipitated the general
election, was born in Hobart in ’5B. Seven
years previously, Mrs. Humphry Ward, the
novelist, was born in the same old town. In
youth Lewis was sent to the High School
at Hobart. One James Anthony Froude, an
Oxford man in clerical orders, had just pre-
viously been engaged to come out from Eng-
land to be headmaster of the school, but the
principals discovered that Froude had writ-
ten “The Nemesis of Faith,” and his ap-
pointment was cancelled. Lewis went from
the High School to Baliol College, under
the great Jowett. In 1885 he returned to
Tasmania, and in the next year was elected
member for Richmond in the Assembly. The
Lewis family settled in Tasmania in Water-
loo year (1815). N.E. is of the third gener-
ation. His wife is daughter of Charles
Youl, of Symmons Plains, Tas. —of the
family which gave Victoria Dr. Richard
Youl, for about half a century City Coroner
of Melbourne.
“Backblocker’s” reminiscence:—
Mrs. Henry Forsyth, who was drowned on a fish-
ing excursion in M.L., last week, was unique as a
sportswoman. She hunted regularly in Leicester-
shire ; and, on horses which she had bought cheap and
practically made herself, she won a reputation for
nerve and skill that no other Australian has enjoyed
in that hard-riding and hyper-critical part of the
world. She drove as well as she rode—four-in-hand,
tandem, unicorn, any combination of horses that
could be imagined. There were few things she didn’t
know about fly-fishing, though she only took to this
highly technical sport late in life. Incidentally she
wrote a fairly successful novel and was at work on
another when she died. But she was seen at her best
in her own home, near Dudley (N.S.W.). Sir Harry
Rawson, after his first visit there, described it as the
nearest thing to Paradise he had seen in Australia
Situated near the edge of a cliff, one aspect took in
the Pacific Ocean 700 feet below, another a lake and
a_ series of mountains stretching away in the blue
distance. The place had originally been a miner’s
hut. She kept the adobe floor, the flame tree which
grew through the roof of the old edifice, and the
enormous fireplace. Round these she constructed a
house which, while defying all the known laws of
architecture, was, artistically, absolutely satisfying
—for one thing, doubtless, because it harmonised so
perfectly with its environment. The living rooms
radiated off the drawing-room (the only one in the
Commonwealth, probably, with an adult tree in the
midst of it), and the old-fashioned garden pushed it-
self unexpectedly in between them at every turn.
There was a steeplechase course on the grounds and
anyone who felt like a ride before breakfast could
rely on getting a lead over it from his hostess. Alto-
gether she was a remarkable character, the tvne of
daring and absolutely efficient Australian woman
whom one reads about often, but rarely meets.
Dr. Anthony Colling Brownless, who died
at Darlinghurst on January 21, was the
eldest son, by a second marriage, of the late
Amthony Colling Brownless, for years the
picturesque Chancellor of Melbourne Univer-
sity. The son, like the father, married twice;
the second wife was a daughter of Mr. White,
a__ well-known turfite, and his wife, Myra
Kemble, an old Australian stage favorite.
The Tasmanian Speck has been meanly
robbed of the only scrap of distinction that
has come its way for some time. It was to
have been governed by plain Mister Ellison-
Macartney; but, at the last moment, the
new cocked-hat was captured, thrown, and
branded with the well-worn K.C.M.G. iron.
Now, he will graze with the vast chaotic
herd that is pastured in the back paddocks
of Whitaker’s Peerage.
Melbourne is again bereft of the ghostly
comfort of its Anglican Archbishop. Lowther
Clarke and his family went steaming away
to dear old England a week or so back. It
is good to be an archbishop. It seems also
good to be called Lowther: that family looms
large in England wherever privileges and
perks are to be picked up. Even grievous
lack of both eloquence and tact doesn’t seem
to be a disqualification when a Lowther is
out after an archbish’s billet.
“Scribe” conducts a post-mortem :
A. L. Windsor, successively Argus and Age editor,
was born at sea, and so was Schuler, his successor
on the Age. Windsor’s father owned and lived upon
large sugar estates in Barbadoes. At eight years old
Arthur was sent to school in Devonshire When t>e
began to consider life he studied a while for the
Church, but the Old Testament proved too steep. So
he took a classical mastership at Clifton College, and
wrote. Macaulay having praised his work, he published
a book of essays called “Ethica,” which may be found
in the Melbourne Public Library. Then the Argus
advertised in London for an editor. Windsor did not
apply, but a friend obtained the billet for him. An
inexplicable condition was that he never should enter
the Melbourne Club. At the Argus he followed
Watts. His other predecessors were King, Wilson,
Higinbotham, Jarrett and Patmore; his successors
Haddon, Willoughby, Watterson (with Cunningham),
and Cunningham suit's. Age editors have been E.
Syme, G. P. Smith, Harrison, Windsor and Schuler.
Windsor stayed two and a half years with the Argus,
and then retired to the humble pie of the Castlemaine
Mail for three years. Back in Melbourne he wrote
for the Age, and was editor from 1872 to 1900 —28
years of a peculiar kind of brilliant success. He fullv
believed in the principle that journalists are all
of the same religion and politics. What? They
never tell. Windsor always passed for a sort of Tory,
but nobody could nail him to anything. He was a
paradox like Wilkes, who assured King George that
he never was a Wilkesite. His contempt for the cag-
mag of news was sublime. His forte, in which he
was beyond rivalry, was the hitt"r satiric political
or social article. Emphatically he was a writing
editor. Syme was in fact the editor all along, Wind-
sor the grand vizier. Like G. P. Smith and Harri-
son, he had an unerring scent for libel; Syme said
he could go home comfortably and leave the paper in
hands of such men. Yet I am convinced that
Windsor could not have held on longer at the Age
than at the Argus if Syme had not been behind him
tor the practical business part of the job. He was no
more good than James Smith for the current, fact-y
political, up-to-date leading article ; that sort had to
be supplied by such as Pearson, Deakin and Hoare,
Windsor &S rams ’ or by Syme speaking through
THE TRUTH TELLER.

four years old he went to Tasmania with
his parents and one sister. In 1891 he first
offered himself for West Hobart, and was
returned at the head of the poll. After the
election he became Minister of Railways
and Mines. Since then he has held various
other offices ; and at odd times he has also
been shipwright, men’s clothier, blacksmith

“P.X.”: Once more I see it

Novelist Rider Haggard, a mem-

special commissioner to the Trans-

to the Secocoeni Commission. In
1901-2 he travelled from end to
end of England investigating the
condition of agriculture and of the
rural population, and three years
later was appointed Commissioner
to report on Salvation Army set-
tlements in America. After that
he was chairman of the Reclama-

George Johnston, was in charge of the Gov-

ufled there. Governor Macquarie ordered
Greenaway, the Government architect, to
piepare a vault on the Annandale estate for
the reception of the remains. Many of the
tamiiy were interred there; but when the
estate was cut up and sold, the contents were
removed to a vault at Waverley.
HIS ATTITUDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“My attitude has always been as it is now.”
—Joe Cook.
One weary time I wagged a pick
In deep, dark mines, and smoke and ate
By miry Tom, and Bill, and Mick
In reeking drives, and with my mate
I punched the coal and gouged the slate.
The hopes behind my dome-like brow
Were then the hopes I cherish now.
They put me into Parliament.
From boots and pants I scraped the clay ;
I donned the garments of a gent.,
And fought the workers’ fight all day,
The wicked hopes of Fat to slay.
My attitude, you will allow,
M as just the same as it is now.
I seek with votes and fiery speech
The great rapacity to feed
Of Property; I strive to teach
The people that their friend indeed
Is old insatiable Greed ;
And what it’s always been, I vow,
My moral attitude is now.
I’m he they lifted from the pit
To help improve the toiler’s case,
And eheek-by-jowl, with Fat I sit,
Endeavoring with brazen face
To keep the worker in his place.
A rigid weathercock, I trow,
Joe always was, and Joe is now!

This bank is getting a move on. The fact probably
is that it didn’t cut deep enough into its capital after
the crisis, 20 years ago, and still had a lot of over-
valued assets on its hands. In the ordinary
course it would then have to hang on to profits in
order to write those assets down. During the last few
years values have recovered in a very emphatic way ;
and this has doubtless had two results—it has re-
lieved the co. of the need to hang on to profits, and
it has enabled the co. to get rid of old assets without
loss, and put the money into business with more life
in it. Visible profits have practically doubled in
seven years, and the circumstances just mentioned no
doubt explain why. Which is another way of saying
that there is no reason to question the legitimacy of
the present profits because they were only half as big
seven years ago.
The least satisfactory feature of the Bank of Vic-
toria’s accounts for some time past has been the com-
paratively poor holding of liquid assets. Take this
comparison first:—

Premises, etc. .. 377,545 367,378 Dec. 10,167
The bank thus owes the public £7,031,379. Of that
amount only 28 p.c. is liquid. There may be special
circumstances in the case; but, ordinarily, this is
not enough, especially at a time when deposits are
on the downward track and the legitimate call for
advances is certainly not likely to be less. There is a
temptation to lend freely when things seem good ; but
it is poor policy to lend so much that very profit-
able business offered by old customers must be turned
away later on when things don’t seem so good.
But while this bank may be working on too narrow
a margin of cash and liquid assets, its general posi-
tion appears to be strong. It owes the public, as
mentioned just now, £7,031,379. Its own capital
and reserves total £1,805,853. Thus, for every £1
of its own it has no more than £3 17s 6d. of the
public s money—a very low figure. And the lower
the figure the better, of course, the security of the de-
positors and the smaller the shareholders’ risks. On
the other hand, the less public money a bank has to
play with, the smaller naturally would one expect
its earnings to be. In the circumstances, the Victoria
does very well to show these figures relating to
profits earned in proportion to capital and reserves:
June, 1998 .. £5 18 11 p.c. Dec., 1910 .. £6 0 3n c

Dec., 1909 .. 517 " ~ June, 1912 .. 619 8
June, 1910 .. 515 10 „ Dec., 1912 .. 710 5 ”
The business, one would judge from that, is good •
though, admittedly, the test is not always reliable.
Just before the crisis, for instance, this bank showed
earnings so good that it was paying a 12 p.c. div.
The misfortune then was that the earnings were onlv
on paper.

the £35,000 written off for the past half-year

Ihe original writing off was not nearly vigorous
enough. Certainly there was hardly any of the
shareholders’ capital left, and the only other thing
that could have been done was to have invited the
depositors to regard some of their money as gone—
as indeed it was. A backstair way of arriving at
the same end was preferred: the depositors got
pref. shares for one-third of their money, and to
this day those shares carry only 3 p.c. Further
they are never entitled to more than 4 p.c. With
the object of cleaning up the old mess an’ Assets
Realisation Trust was created. Nominally this is
independent of the bank; but as the bank is re-
sponsible for the Trust’s debts, the two are really
one. Treating them as such, and accepting the
management’s estimate of the value of the assets,
we get this result:—

off there would be £18,786 over for reserves.
There is a heap to be said in favor of writing off
the capital not represented by assets, and making
a start with a clean sheet; but apparently there is
some difficulty in reconciling the conflict of interests
between the two classes of shares. The prefs, as
mentioned just now, are entitled to 4 p.c before the
ordmaries get anything: what is left may go to
the ordinaries. And as the ordinary caoital is so
small, the div. may be tremendous. But, as the
Pr, r°A d the greater voting power, it is question-
able whether they will permit very gaudy divs. to be
paid, to the detriment of the reserves; for of course
the bigger the reserves the safer the pref. share-
holders 4 p.c. The N.Z. Loan and Mercantile
Agency Co. fixed up a somewhat similar trouble the
other day; and the business of the bank would cer-
tainly be improved if there were a rearrangement
here. A bank lives on credit; and its credit is
aiways likely to be prejudiced by the fact that the
bulk of its shares are under par—which those of the
Commercial of Australia are always likely to be until
things are rearranged.

It is satisfactory to see that though money has
been coming in pretty freely the bank hasn't been
making advances with a lordly hand. Total liabili-
ties to the public are £1,913,272. Coin and liquid
assets total £503,357. The latter is equal to 26 p.c.
of the former. It is still a very poor holding of
liquid assets, though the figures are an improvement
on those of recent terms. Still they show this —-
that on its present resources the bank can’t safely
lend more than it is lending now. And that is not
a good position for any bank to get into. A bank
is certainly under no obligation to lend any client
more money; but the one that can’t or won’t help
one good customer over a tight pinch, is liable to
lose several customers. It isn’t the bank which
helps in good, prosperous times, when money is
cheap, that deserves thanks. It is rather the one
which says no and hangs on to a bit in such times,
so that it may more freely lend a hand in bad ones.
This doesn’t apply particularly to the City of Syd-
ney except, as said just now, that this naper would
like to see it with more than 26 p.c. of its lia-
bilities represented by cash, considering that we are
probably just a little way over the crest of a boom,
and many people will probably be wanting and de-
serving more help presently.

That is the best we can do with it. It was not in-
tended that anyone should be able to do very much.
For years past, knowing that municipal enterprise
was threatening, the co., like most other N.S.W. gas
cos., has been stuffing away profit. That is to say,
it was using undisclosed profits to purchase assets
which never went in the published accounts; or it
used them to write down assets below their fair value.
Then the Gas Bill dropped in like a bomb. It pro-
posed to disregard reserves altogether in fixing the
standard dividend. The Act, as passed, gives the
cos. six months to capitalise their reserves. To take
advantage of that provision the old make-believe of
the cos. had to be exposed ; one after the other they
began to shake the hidden trumps out of their sleeves.
The process was called “revaluing the assets.” By how
much this co. wrote its assets up it is impossible to
say exactly. For a good while previously it had
180.000 shares issued and fully paid to £l. Early
in 1911 it issued 30,000 more. The final ss. was due
on September 1, 1912, That made 210,000 issued
and fully paid. In July it was decided to issue an-
other 105.000 shares—in case of accidents. Only Is.
was payable on these—in August. When the re-
valuation of assets was made, and the big
surplus was shown, the co. decided to pav
out as a bonus 7s. 6d. per share on the £1 paid
shares, and 9d. per share on those paid to Is. Calls
were then made on the 105,000 shares, and the bonus
was applied to the payment of calls. Practically,
therefore, the shareholders got for every two old £1
shares one new bonus share paid to 15s. 9d. Another
Is. 3d. has been called, making the shares 17s. paid.
The total amount of the bonus was £82,687. But
apparently something more than that was written on
to the book value of the assets. It will be noticed that
the profit for the past half-year is shown in the table
as £28,611. It is, however, probable that part of
this consists of written-up values. All that can be
said with certainty is that, after providing for the
bonus ( £82,687), the accounts show £28,611 more
than they did six months ago.
Now something else is to be done. The formal re-
serve fund stands at £63,000 —just enough to pro-
vide one fully-paid share for every five hitherto
issued. The directors propose to ask the shareholders
to agree to this being done; and The Bulletin
doesn't think the suggestion will lead to any serious
rioting. This will make the capital £378,000.
(The unpaid 3s. on the 105,000 shares was due on
January 6.) By these various juggles (legitimate
enough, in the circumstances) a 6 p.c. dividend will
he worth as much to the shareholders as a 10 pc
div. would be on the actually paid capital. Mean-
time, to keep the consumers in a sweet temper, and
also to entitle the co. to pay the old rate of dividend,
the price of gas has been reduced from 3s. 9d. to
3s. 6d. per 1000 ft., as from January 1.
The Gas Act, 1912, now in force, provides for a
standard rate of dividend of 10 p.c. p.a., and a
standard charge for gas of 3s. 6d. per 1000 ft. Cos.
are specifically authorised to capitalise their reserves,
but they must do it within six months. This capital
is entitled to 10 p.c. also. Any subsequently-raised
ordinary capital is entitled to only 7 p.c. as a
standard; for pref. capital to be hereafter raised, the
standard is fixed at 5 p.c. If a co. reduces its price
below 3s. 6d., it may pay i p.c. more in dividend for
every Id. of reduction; if it charges more than 3s.
6d., the dividend must he reduced on the same scale
But, on official inquiry, if it is found that costs have
increased by reason of a Wages Board award, or any-
thing of that sort, the extra may be added on to the
3s. 6d., and the dividend need not be reduced. Share-
holders are also interested in the provisions respecting
new issues of shares. The first runs—“ All shares to
he issued shall be offered for sale by public auction
or tender.” Others put the brake on the accumula-
tion of reserves, the object, of course, being to compel
the cos to reduce the price of gas when they can
afford to do it. From all of which it is plain that
though gas cos. have been left the teeth they had!
they are not to be allowed to grow any more. The
distribution of fat bonus shares or cash is at an end
when the six months’ grace has expired.

This e°. has fine factories and has just started’ to
build another to take the place of the one at Oamaru In
£ 2 °,000 has been put aside out of the profits
of the past two years towards the cost of this work -
for the present, the amount is included with the re-
serves. The growth of the reserves has been very
remarkable, notwithstanding the sums written off
The latter look large, especially in the light of the
fact that, including land, buildings, shops and
°?9?i’nQi w 6d asset j / un t 0 n ° ™re than
£271,091; but wear and tear on plant of this kind
is heavy and improvements made by competitors are
constantly driving machinery to the scrap-heap. How-
ever, given all that in, the position seems to be ex-
cellent, and the co. managed with a fine amount of
prudence. Liabilities of all kinds total only £42 451
and cash, book debts (£21,483), etc., exceed
that much, with the fixed assets and the stock left
over to represent capital and reserves. The business
is a rather irregular one; but this co. has put itself
into a very good position to meet a turn of the tide
And, anyhow, during the past seven years the profits
have never been less than twice the amount that a
10 p.c. dividend would call for.

Five years ago the co.’s property, apart from fixed
assets and machinery, totalled £5719, and the lia-
bilities were £lO,OOB. Now the property, other
than the fixed assets, is worth £8962 and the liabili-
ties are £320. Thus, from this point of view things
have improved by £12,931. Meantime, considerable
amounts have also been put into fixed property. But
this doesn’t mean necessarily that the co., after pay-
ing the copious dividend, is all that much to the good.
It depends on whether enough, or anything, has been
written off against depreciation ; and on that point
the accounts and report are silent. All that is plain
is that a few hundreds a year have been spent on re-
pairs ; but it doesn’t follow that a patched coat is
worth as much as a new coat. A balance-sheet item
six months ago left a nasty taste in the mouth—
“ Rebuilding Princes wharf, £4318.” That amount
has now been incorporated with the Property account
If the cost of building old Princes wharf had been
written off, then it would be a fair thing to drop in
the new item. But not otherwise. If a man bought
a coat for 525., to last a year, and if he put a shil-
ling into his trousers pocket every week to cover wear
and tear of the coat, then at the end of 52 weeks he
would have no coat worth valuing, but he would have
the price of another one. Then, when he bought an-
other coat, he would be entitled to put the cost of the
new coat among his assets. But he obviously wouldn’t
• en .titl e d to put the cost of the two coats there
Ihis is the doubt in this case. Does the co. write off
the value of its coat as it wears it out? Or does it
leave the old coat in the balance-sheet and put the
value of the new one on top of it? It doesn’t look
the sort of co. that would do this sort of thing but
the position ought to be made plain.

place in order; the lessees will have to keep it in
order, paying for everything except structural altera-
tions that may become necessary. The terms of the
lease, so far as money is concerned, are not dis-
closed, though it was mentioned six months ago that
from 1918 onwards the J.C.W. co. would pay “a
considerably increased rent.” The T. R. Prop. Co.
itself holds the property on a lease with 50 years or
more to run. Its own principal assets are therefore
shrinking continuously. Yet, instead of writing
them down regularly, and establishing a sinking
fund for the return of capital, varying amounts are
written off spasmodically. This is how the thing
stands now:—

The c °. is 22 years old. Now that the eo. has let
its theatre and pub. on a long lease and knows pretty
well what its revenue will be for the next 15 years
at least, it ought to set its house in order by estab-
lishing the sinking fund mentioned above. Its finan-
cial position is easy : its liquid assets amount to
within a pound or two of the liabilities, notwith-
standing the recent outlay.

The 1.0. A. (Insurance Office of Australia),
which was formed a' couple of years ago to butt into
the fire and marine business, has thoughts of taking
its head office from Sydney to Melbourne. The -joint
managers (Stockfeld and Doherty) are strongly in
favor of the move, arguing that more shareholders
are down south than up north, and that the co.’s
business prospects are brighter in Melbourne than
in Sydney, but the Board in Sydney is, perhaps
naturally, disinclined to sanction the shift. The
matter is to be fought out at the shareholders’ meet-
ing ; and on present appearances the change will be
made. Certainly, as the managers are the men who
promoted the co. and * are more or less personally
pledged to make money for the shareholders, their
considered opinion ought to, carry great weight.
Maoruand is still borrowing every penny
it can lay its hands on. This shows the Oct -Dec.

Thus the advances are now in excess of deposits,
fixed and current. The figures suggest that the country
is living beyond its means; and there is only one
thing ahead of either country or individual that keeps
on this course long enough—smash!

The Bulletin has said a few dozen or
hundred times that the prbfits of a trading co. depend
almost wholly upon the valuation of the merchandise
stock and other assets. If too big a price is set on
the stock, the profits are, of course, inflated. This
will probably be found to be what is most the matter
with the J. D. Williams Co., whose shares have come
such a smash in the past fortnight. On top of that,
there was water and more water, and the manage-
ment never got the confidence of the men who handle
the big investments. Add the fact that the bull
buyers were mostly weak, that a fire or two hap-
pened at an awkward time, and you've got all the
explanation necessary to account for the slump.
From an old insurance man : —ln my con-
tribution to The Bulletin of 19/12/’l2, I referred
to the substitution of the actuarial reserve value of
a life policy for the entirely arbitrary, and always
unjust, “surrender value” that an office may formu-
late for the victimisation of its policy-holders, and
for the increase of its surplus profits. In the Insur-
ance Bill, which has since been introduced, it is pro-
posed that “the reserve value of a policy shall be the
full amount reserved by the company "in respect of
the policy in accordance with its latest method of
valuation, and shall not be the amount which the
company is prepared to pay in cash on the surrender
of the policy.” This does not affect the position from
the point of view of the harpy; he may now pur-
chase a valuable policy for £3OO (the “surrender
value”), and, some months later, may obtain from
the office a fullv-paid policy for the reserve value of
from £5OO to £6OO. In the circumstances, the
Idunder I anticipated from the Federal Parliament
is apparent, and, therefore, the harpies have a free
hand for some months to come.
The proposed Bill is all in favor of the man who
is financial yet desires to cease premium paying
while ensuring his “cover,” and does not help the
man who is with his back to the wall and is obliged to
accept a “surrender value” for pressing needs. No
principle of equity can possibly justify such differen-
tiation as is proposed. If a co. can be forced by Act
to treat a reserve value as a single premium for
the purchase of a fully-paid policy, then such co.
should be obliged to make the amount of that reserve
value available for payment in consideration of the
absolute surrender of the policy. Section 64 pro-
vides as follows: “A policyholder who desires to dis-
continue further premium payments shall, on applica-
tion to the co., be entitled to receive a paid-up policy
of such amount as would be purchasable with
the reserve value of his policy at the due
date of the next premium available in re-
spect thereof.” It is clear that the Bill intends that
the reserve value shall be the single premium for the
purchase of the fully-paid policy. If an office
demonstrates by its actuarial valuation of two
policies that each has a reserve value of £6OO, it has
no right to be allowed to differentiate between the
two by allowing one policyholder a cash “surrender
value” of £3OO, because he is in urgent need of
money, and the other a purchasing power of £6OO,
because he will take out a fullyoaid policy. The
flagrant injustice of the differentiation between a
cash “surrender value” and a reserve value will be
illustrated in a striking manner bv the following
hypothetical case. Assume a policy for £1250, a re-
serve value of £6OO, and a cash “surrender value”
of £3OO. The life policyholder may borrow 90 p.c.
of the “surrender value,” i.e., £270. If he default
in payment of interest and future premiums, the co.
is presumably obliged ( vide section 65) to continue
the policy in force until the indebtedness amounts to
the reserve value. Thus, when such a policy would
lapse, the accumulations in respect of loans, interests
and premiums would amount to £7OO or more —the
then reserve value. If Parliament is prepared to con-
serve the interests of the policyholder up to the
standard of the reserve value, in respect of unpaid
premiums, why should the policyholder not be allowed
to draw the reserve value if he chooses to surrender
his policy, or 90 p.c. of that reserve value if he re-
quires a loan ?
If the provisions of the Bill under review are en-
acted by Parliament, then we will have the spectacle
of the Commonwealth permitting cos. to formulate
arbitrarily low and unjust “surrender values” to
operate against individuals in unfortunate circum-
stances ; while it gives those companies a license to
show preference to others who are less in need of
special consideration : and, furthermore, the Com-
monwealth will lend itself to the creation of a field
for the benefit of the harpy, at the expense of the
necessitous policyholder.
I venture to advance the views (1) that the reserve
value should be fixed as the basis of all relations be-
tween policyholder and co. ; (2) that loans should be
available up to the extent of 90 p.c. of the re-
serve value; and (3) that the “surrender value”
should be fixed at 80 p.c. of the reserve value. It
may be argued that this would lead to the loss of
considerable business ; but the opposite would be the
case. At present the loss of business, owing to the
exhaustion of the very limited “surrender values,” is
exceedingly large, and is due entirely to the scant
consideration =hown to policyholders. If the reserve
value of a policy were made the basis of a loan or
surrender (in the percentages mentioned above), verv
few absolute surrenders would ensue, for the reason
that a policyholder in necessitous circumstances could
arrange for the issue of a naid-up policy to himself,
and then borrow 90 p.c of the reserve value which
had been made the consideration of the issue of his
paid-up policy. Such policvholder would then have
an interest in a very considerable equity of redemp-
tion, which would be well worth protecting by pav-
ing the interest under his loan. Under the present
conditions everv inducement is offered to the policy-
holder in necessitous circumstances to surrender his
nolicv, instead of becoming a borrower, inasmuch as
he may draw the full “surrender value.” whereas if
he takes a loan he would receive only 90 p.c. of that
“surrender value.” Such policyholder naturally
argues that the 10 p.c. margin of the “surrender
value” left over the amount of the loan, mav be
swamped by any possible default, in respect of pre-
miums as well as of interest, on his part: so that. he
would be wise to surrender outright instead of taking
a loan.
Assuming a company had just completed an
actuarial valuation, and desired to wind up, would
the policvholders not be paid in cash the reserve
values shown to belong to them? If those reserve
values were not paid to the policvholders in full, to
whom would the balances belong ? Because such a co. is
desirous of continuing its operations, is that any
reason why it should deliberately set itself (with the
complicity of Parliament if the new Bill be passed)
to rob a section of the policyholders for the advantage
of the others?

Kyloe (N.S.W.) has done splendid work
in cooper concentration. A recent return shows
that the mill treated 239 tons of 4.5 p.c. ore in a
week, and recovered 80.3 p.c. of the copper in the
torm of high-grade concentrate containing from 20
h'L. P-c. metal. Kyloe can treat 5 p.c. ore
" ith two-thirds of a pound of crude eucalyptus oil,
and the cost of the oil is about sd. per ton of ore.
•Jig residues can be treated very effectively and
cheaply. 1 ailings contain less than 1 p.c. copper.
Considering the success achieved by its mill, Kyloe
deserves more luck with its mine; but No. 7 level
has not run into payable ore yet.

There is a solid lode of sulphide ore at
the 315 ft. level worth 5 p.c., and this has been driven
on for 150 ft. to the westward. The width of the
lode varies a great deal. At the 213 ft. level it is
up to 10ft. wide. Other copper mines in this dis-
trict are in good heart, particularly the Carolina,
which .is four miles from Tottenham. This mine
sends its ore to the Bogan smelter, and regular ship-
ments of matte are made to Port Kembla.
The two biggest Broken Hill concerns are
hard at work on new industrial undertakings. The
H. Prop, has got its iron and steel proposition so
far advanced that it has just announced the issue of
240,000 shares at £2, or a premium of £1 12s.
The Sulphide Corporation is more modest. Its latest
activities are in the direction (1) of saving ammonia
and other coal by-products, and (2) of using the fur-
nace by-products in the manufacture of superphos-
phates. Plants for both purposes have been put in
hand at Newcastle.

After seven years. Professor Nicholas has
again taken charge of Burbank’s Birthday Gift
(W.A.). In the old days when he had control, nine
levels were opened up and 132,700 tons were ex-
tracted and treated for a return of over half a million
sterling. About £lOO,OOO was paid in dividends;
then the co. experienced a lean time, which termin-
ated in reconstruction. 8., M. and Co. next came
upon the scene and dug out an additional £69,300.
They, however, did not succeed in making any money
for shareholders, and finally let tributors have a
look-in. The latter recovered another £69,000; but,
instead of making headway, the finances of the co.
went backward, and at the end of 1911 they were in
rather a bad way. Since then £28,000 more has
been extracted by tribute parties, and from all ac-
counts there isn’t much left for the Professor to get
hold of.
* * * *
Although warned that such was not the
case, Ida H (W.A.) clung to the idea 15 months ago
that a large tonnage of soz. ore awaited extraction
from the bottom levels and beyond. A little stoping
showed that there wasn’t much left, and after paying
the first of promised monthly dividends the Board had
to admit that it had made a mistake to pay anv at
all. Unhinged by disappointment, it tried to make
a recovery by gambling in Nigerian tin stocks, and
got deeper into the mire. At the meeting held in
London last month, shareholders were told that,
although the payment of dividends could not be
resumed at present, there was reasonable hope of
something later on. Shareholders will, however, be
foolish if they build on the-chance.
* * * *
With the aid of tributors and an occa-
sional turn-up, Paringa (W.A.) manages to earn a
little. Last year it dug up £12,352 on its own
account and collected an additional £713 in royal-
ties Recent development is stated to have exposed
a good shoot of ore at the No. 1 and 2 levels of
Geach’s workings, and as there are plenty of funds
in hand, the management has been instructed to bog
in and see how values shape in deeper ground.
* * * *
A conference of diggers and prospectors
sitting at Kalgoorlie has agreed upon . the follow-
in*?* (1) That no royalty should be paid by tribu-
tors unless each man earns at least £4 per week,
and then not more than 10 p.c. of the gold should be
handed over ; (2) that concentration of labor should
not be granted over more than 96 acres, and labor
conditions should not be considered fulfilled by tri-
butors unless one man is employed to every three
acres; (3) that concentration should not be granted
on idle ground unless a guarantee is given that it
will be let on tribute; (4) that rents should be
payable quarterly and power given a registrar to
defer payments; (5) that the size of areas pegged
by those who arrive first at a new rush should be
limited; (6) that no provision should be made for
a fine in lieu of forfeiture; (7) that Government
diamond drills should be more freely used for pros-

The owners of the Revenue claim, Bamboo
Creek (W.A.), have had some remarkable specimens
on view in a window in Perth lately. They claim to
have crushed three tons of stone in 1911 for 8200 z.,
and one ton during 1912 for 2750 z. Judging by the
specimens, these startling results seem feasible. Bam-
boo Creek is in the Marble Bar district.
At the Lord Nelson, St. Arnaud (Vic.),
it took just £16,500 during the past six months to
make £17,512, leaving £lOl2 profits available. The
bank cash account is £1156, plus stores, etc,
£1917. This isn’t much for a mine working sJdwt.
gold; but the Lord Nelson lot are cheerful
and still live in dreamland. Otherwise there would
be a lot of growling at the report. It is confessed
that 11,972 tons averaged only sJdwt., and the
extent of the stopes is disclosed ; but not a word is
said of the values at the 2225 ft. or the 2405 ft.
There isn’t, however, more than a hatful of stone left
at the 2225 ft. level, and work at the bottom level
shows that the formation has shrunk. Then the
fault that came in at about 1400 ft. has sliced the
shoot and the stone into two, the bigger slab being
to the north. All this indicates the wisdom of the
fusion of the Lord Nelson and the North; but the
price paid when the register was bounced up to
72,000 shares was out of all proportion.
Diamond Creek lies within an hour or
two of Collins-street, and holds the mine nearest
to Melbourne. Moreover, wonder of wonders, it
turns out divs. with happy regularity. With from
only three to nine inches to work on, ounce dirt
would frighten the color out of Alex. Gordon’s face.
As things go, the average pans out at 30dwt.
Therefore Diamond Creek furnishes the richest aver-
age of almost any mine of consistent running in Vic-
toria. Sinking is down to No. 9 level, where if the
co. has its old luck it won’t find the lode whittled
down to a thread, as was promised on one or two
occasions. No. 8 North shows a nine-inch shoot 200 ft.
long standing strong against the miner’s pick.
Central Red, White and Blue, Bendigo,
has alighted on the cap of a small saddle in its
shaft. That is not to interfere with the sink, for
it is on the cards that the Little 180 saddle will
come in lower down as a further sweetener. If the
co. happens to get on to a speck or two of gold in
either the present saddle or in the 180 formation,
there will be a little kick to help Bendigo at a time
when it ranks as an outsider. Connection is estab-
lished between the 400 and the intermediate levels
north at the Central Blue, and it is to this point that
the drill will now be applied. A nice block exists
here. It is needed, too, seeing how stoping has gone
on at 318 ft.; but the Beehive wants to know the
grade of this stone and its size. Still, the gamble in
the Central Blue is the way the Little 180 formation
may develop whenever it is got. The crowd at the
back of the show will know first, but there should
be a chance for shareholders to pop in if they worry
round sufficiently.
* # * *
To its immortal credit be it said that
Burnt Creek, Dunolly, paid a shilling or two in the
dim past. Since then there has been clanking of
pumps and hauling of dirt and wheedling of calls
out of a nest of optimistic shareholders. Called-up
capital appears at £66,000, represented for the
greater part this way: Mine account, £16,271;
machinery at cost, £10,883; working account, two
shafts, £39,000. The little co. has long had the
best support, men like James Randell, Prof. Nanson,
James McCrorey and the Finks having shouldered its
weight for a dreary decade. Now Burnt Creek is on
the dividend list again, largely because of some hope-
ful cyanide chap who has got on to the old slum
dump. Taking mine work, the return of £16,228
for the past six months represents_ an average of
14-klwt. per square fathom. This gives about
£2300 profit for the term. The Board isn’t taking
any risks about the future, being content to promise
sixpence monthly for some time ahead. What tempers
their anticipations is that in the rise in the west
end of the mine, water is heavy and prospects don’t
look very good. Crosscutting may change this, but
the further down the lead the higher costs must go.
* * * *
Cameron’s Ajax, Daylesford, lies to the
west of the Ajax group, and must not be con-
founded with the big Ajax mines that have caused
so many aches and pains to bulls and bears. The
chief possessions to date are hard slate and a well-
defined lode track. In the latter occur bunches of
quartz, respecting which the best testimony available
is that they give “good prospects at times.” This is
like the occasional sobering-up of a hard drunk.
There is also the usual mixture formation out of
which comes the usual flow of water. It is on this
shandygaff stuff that expectation is built. Seeing
the wad of forfeited scrip in hand, a strike of decent
quartz would mudhook up a fair-sized parcel of bears ;
but the situation of the claim doesn’t inspire confi-
dence that anything unexpected of the kind will
happen. * * *
A new tin find has been made at Redrock,
in the Stanthorpe district, about a couple of miles
on the Queensland side of the N.S.W. border. The
man in the street has long been asking for the
whereabouts of the lode from which all the tm
around Stanthorpe came. As a mater of fact, it did
not come from a. lode a.t all, but from the decomposi-
tion of the surface granite. In the new belt, how-
ever, extending from the Beehive pronerty across
Carpenter’s Gully to Sundown, there are quite a
number of lodes carrying good tm. Thus Sundown
has got specimen stone below 80ft. But outside Car-
penter’s Gully, where the stone is low grade, little
development work has been done so far. However it
may turn out at depth, as a surface show the Bee-
hive would be hard to beat. The lease (55 acres) is
nracticallv covered with wash dirt, most of it
payable and some of it highly payable, containing
loose -boulders of rich tin-bearing greisen. These
appear to have broken away from the junction of the
granite and slates, where there are still rich speci-
mens. Not enough work has been done to entitle
anyone to sav how much stone there is : but appear-
ances are promising. The Beehive people have had
V A Derrick and W. H. Rands running the rule
over their property, and both like the surface pros-
npcts Derrick, who has made two inspections, found
at the end of December that the work done since bis
previous visit was bearing out the very favorable
opinion he formed in September. #

Chillagoe continues to feed its sharehold-
ers on hope. The return for four weeks reads: I<9
tons copper, 158 tons lead, 21,7620 z. silver and
5550 z. gold from 3986 tons of ore. An increased
output of metals has been maintained for some time
past so the financial returns for the year ending
March 31 may pan out better. The railway revenue
has also been well sustained, and is shaping for
£lOO 000 per annum. The branch line to Mount
Mullitran coal mine is the most important undertak-
ing since Chillagoe bought the Einasleigh copper-
mine and pushed its railhead to the Etheridge. The
new mill erected to treat the mineralised ore of the
district has done good work, but local opinion is
that charges are too high. The irregular nature. of
the ore shoots throughout the district keeps mining
costs high; and nobody is getting fat. Various
promising mines are being developed by the Mam-
moth Co. at Klondyke (renamed Cardross). The
feature is the high copper and gold assays. If smelt-
ing difficulties can be overcome, considerable quan-
tities of matte will be fed to Chillagoe.
Mount Lyell has been smelting for some
time past with only one furnace, and it has taken
over 100 tons of the low-grade stuff to produce a
ton of copper. The addition of Comstock ore should
brighten up the returns a bit. The North Lyell will
in course of time resume its output of 10,000 tons
per month, but no date can be given. Reserves figure
at 1,083,752 tons, sufficient to last nine years; in
fact, the ore taken out during the past nine years is
nearly the same in quantity as is estimated to be
showing in the mine. Still, in the face of the re-
turns for the last half-year, one has to be optimistic
to consider the North Lyell the old 6 p.c. proposition.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 27, 1913.
My Dear Arini.—
the Mme of the Federal Government,
Minister for Defence Pearce took possession
ot Cockatoo Island, a rocky patch in Syd-
ney arbor, on Saturday afternoon. The
weather gave the impression of being an
out size in bush fires, with the flames sup-
pressed from view. Womenfolk tottered
along the blazing track that led from keel

mostly gowned in white and heavily swathed

the male rush for refreshments began, and

tle Torrens. Then weary legs dragged on-
lookers to Event No. 3. This concerned the
beginning of the. Australian cruiser Bris-
Dane, and the engineer’s work here was care-
fully attended to by Senator Pearce. The
general su pp ression of any desire the public
might have had to be present, gave a small
parochial aspect to a national affair. Though
so little limelight was thrown on it. it was
m effect the most historic event likelv to
occur in this State in 1913.
Mrs. Trefffi and Mrs. Arthur Griffith,
vvith some more womenkind, arrived at
Cockatoo Island in a steam launch. Thev
meant to have sampled the keel-laying, but
Gd • fl a m ] ookin S for beat-apoplexy,
and remained under cover at their moorings.

A S few de< f lth th fi ir exhumed anecdotes,
fr tew °f these well-seasoned tales of old
times are hardy annuals that have earned
a decent burial for a decade to come. Gov-
ernor Phillip, however, is worth his yearly
bouquet, if he were even half as good a
colonist as the early records swear he was.
A curious fact about his vigorous person-
a^ y la the slack or conflicting evidence
about his personal appearance. In a record
of early Sydney, and the voyage from
England, the chronicler describes him
as a small figure in a green surtout, huddled
up on deck (the weather being very stormy)
as sick as a dog.” And that is really the
best description we have of the commander
of our First Fleet.
Wynn ® A rf fb'ize, worth about £35,
o# tl^ S R ear i °a „ Ll ? ter Lister, President
y ow Art Society - Wynne was a
wealthy N.S.W. man, who chanced to look
in at an Art Society’s show some 20 years
ago. In a sudden spasm of enthusiasm he
offered an annual prize of about £2O for the
best landscape exhibited each year under the
Society s shingle. The veteran Piguenit
won the first little heap of cash, which
P. yn nc extended to £25 or thereabouts.
After this there was a Great Silence in the
direction the cash came from: no more was
heard of it till the Rich Man died. Then
Jhe left a bequest of £lOOO. The interest

« fT m Pression leaf y gums on the shores
<or Taylor s Bay pushed this year’s money
unto Lister Lister’s bank account.
Concerning artist Lister Lister, it is
worth a line to say that he was born in
Sydney, and went to England with his
parents when he was too young to defend
himself, being at the knickerbockers age of
seven. He studied art in the famous Bed-
ford schools later on, afterwards exhibited
at most of the leading English and Scottish
shows,, and . returned here 24 years ago. As
an artist Lister Lister is mostly an out-door
man, and sometimes travels far to get the
glint on distant rivers. As a man. he is so
entirely free from malice that the fiercest
rival has never caught him in the act of
hitting back without the gloves.
Lord Chelmsford opened the new £lOO.OOO
head-office of the A.M.P. Society, in Pitt-
street, on Tuesday, and, after a few remarks
ot his own, listened to some dizzving figures
Poured out by chairman Alfred Meeks. Pos-
sibly lest his Ex. should feel as though he
must take hold of something, it was men-
tioned that there was at least one stone in
the fine building that weighed over 11 tons
alleged to be the biggest single bit of Aus-
tralia worked into any building in the citv
The society, like one or two of the big
banks, has a kitchen on the premises, and
the staff can have a chop without taking off
its inky office coat.
The trfigic drowning of Mrs. Henry For-
syth (Newcastle) at Okere, in the Rotorua
district, recalls the sudden depths and illu-
sive shallows of some of Maoriland’s best-
known trout streams and lakes. Even in
midsummer the water is often icy cold, and
the currents add to the menace. Mrs. For-
syth was well known in sporting circles as
one ot the finest horsewomen ever raised in
Australia. A sister used also to be a clever
cross-country rider in the days before the
Sydney Hunt Club breathed its last gasp,
pome times mounted on The Ace, a famous
black hunter, at that time owned by “Banjo”
I aterson, the lady took the timber like a
bird. The late Mrs. Forsyth generally
accentuated her reputation as a sport by
wearing a smart short skirt and manly hat
and coat at local race meetings. Attractive
gaiters completed the outfit if the weather
was damp. Henry Forsyth is the manager
ot .Dudley .Colliery, near Newcastle. He
was with his wife at Okere, and made
strenuous efforts to save the ill-fated sports-
woman.
Minister for Agriculture Trefle, who is
also acting as Minister for Bands, paused
to get his breath the other day, after some
strenuous weeks in his double-barrelled bil-
let. He climbed the hoary head of Kos-
c^ an( f returned with a conviction that
the snowy nob is worth more attention than
it gets as a national health asset. After
a prolonged tussle with the telephone, which
buzzed like a swarm of infuriated bees,
Minister Trefle was understood to say, first,
that snowballing in summer was calculated
to bring a healthy blush to the cheeks of
the most hardened politician; secondly, that
the animal and vegetable matter in that
snow-kissed latitude might be added to with
benefit to the surroundings. And then he
effervesced with enthusiasm over the joy of
being alive, with the chance of catching
snowballs in mid-summer.
-The Government hostel at Kosciusko is
now exceptionally well-managed by Mr.
Cheeseman,” says the busy Trefld in breath-
less parenthesis, “and the natural beauties
of the place might be added to by the intro-
duction of Australian birds—waterfowl for
the lake, for instance-—and animals. The
latter would be a source of interest to visi-
tors if they were kept in a reserve se't apart
for that purpose—Hullo! are you there?
In January the winter snow hasn’t
melted —1 didn’t qui te caich that—huiio !
the new golf links are good—and you can
either snowball oh”- —-Whir-r-r. Then the
’phone gave a convulsive click in its throat,
and returned to ifes favorite occupation of
imitating a bee-farm.
A golf enthusiast, just back from Leura,
where the N.S.W. Golf Union had six days
of unalloyed caddy and ball, poured a few
details into my listening ear. Monday, Jan.
20, the first day on the links, was heavily
rained on. It didn’t damp the golfer’s spirits
to any great extent, and a bogey competi-
tion gave Mrs. O’Callaghan, who tied with
another Golfing Petticoat, a chance to show
her mettle. On Tuesday, Jan. 21, Miss
Nellie Meers (Mudgee) snatched the Blue
Mountain championship from 18 or 20 com-
petitors. Weather good. Sunburnt noses
in the offing of the best players. Jan. 22,
Ladies’ Doubles. This was won by Mrs.
and Miss Purdie (Orange). The latter is
a golfer of some local renown, for she car-
ried off the country championship last July
at Kensington.
On Thursday the golf speciality known as
a choice score careered across the links.
The Choicest was Miss Edith Minter (Syd-
ney ), who was ahead of competition. Other
swift players, who tied in this match, were
the good-looking Miss Mabel Mackenzie
(Dubbo), Mrs. Christian (Hunter’s Hill),
Miss Egan and another. On Friday, any
inhabitant of Leura who was not on the golf
links was a person who was deaf to the yell
of the caddy, and habitually refrained from
the joys of “lost ball.” Two-thirds of the
population followed the players round the
rolling links that run up to the edge of a
vast, indigo-blue gully. Miss Edith Minter
won this set by an eyelash from Miss Egan.
On Saturday an orgy of golf ended in mixed
foursomes, won by Mrs. Christian and Mr.
Forsyth. Miss Kiss (Kensington) and Mr.
Wilkinson (Hunter’s Hill) put in some
swift work in the foursomes, doing the 18
holes in the gross score of 87. Miss Egan
entertained the golfers (about 40) to tea
in the Club House. The Leura links had
been loaned by the local club for the palpi-
tating events just mentioned. The Ladies’
Golf Union fell upon the necks of the care-
takers, Mr. and Mrs. Millington, at parting,,
and thanked them in three volumes for their
attention to the golfers’ hunger and thirst.
Artist Joe Wolinski and his fine, upstand-
ing sister Zara, went off to London in the
Maloja. Before leaving, he had something
of interest to say aibout Mark Rubin, the
London pearl merchant, one of whose safes
had, according to a cable, just resisted a 12-
hour burglar siege. The industrious and
scientific Dukes of the Crowbar got away
with nothing : indeed, they left in their hur-
ried flight £6O worth of up-to-date burgling
plant.
Says WoEnski: “Mr. Rubin, who is of
Polish descent, is a firm friend and patron
of mine. . I have done a good deal of work
for him, including a portrait of Mrs. Rubin
and her celebrated pearl necklet, which is
said to be worth £BO,OOO. These gems were
kept for safety in the equally famous safe,
a Chatsworth, which resisted the burglar’s
attack the other day. The contrivance is
supposed to be the last word in safety. It
is, roughly, the shape of a wide cross. In
the top part there is a place where four let-
ters, making a certain word, must be in-
serted. This releases a sheet of steel. Until
that is done, there is no hope of getting to
the lock. It was supposed to be an impos-
sible proposition for ‘the talent,’ and so it has
proved. It was Mr. Rubin who bought ‘The
Ghetto School’ and ‘Autumn Fancies,’ which
I exhibited here last year; he lent them to
me to show in my own city of Sydney.”
. Rubin, by the way, started in Melbourne
in the opal business as quite a young man.
Then he went off to London. Opals dropped
out of favor for a time, and Rubin went in
for pearls. To-day he is one of the foremost
dealers in these illusive gems, with extensive
fisheries in Westralian waters. His wife
was a Miss Rebecca Davis, of Melbourne.
The Chatriotic Club ladies lent their
good-looking Bligh-street premises for the
farewell sing-song to Zara Wolinski the
other night. . Solicitor Aubrey Halloran
handed the girl a plump silver bag, nicely
padded with sovereigns. This gift was from
various friends and acquaintances to speed
the singer on her way to Europe. Brother
Wolinski will put Zara’s voice under Bouhy
or some other top-notch teacher.
Pianist de Beaupuis, who has been holi-
daying in Rotorua (M.L.) and other geyser-
strewn hamlets, gets back to Sydney in a day
or two. At Whakarewarewk the small
brown babies danced a haka for the visiting
musician. He was so charmed with their
sense of rhythm that he acted as impromptu
conductor. Anyone who has seen a succes-
sion of fat and mostly unclad Maori young-
s^ rs ln a ku.ka, can picture the orchestral
effects of their toes under the baton of a
professional air-beater.
Arthur Gordon, a promising young fiddler
from the. Thames district of Maoriland,
passed this port the other day. He is on the
trek to Brussels to absorb technique from
the mighty Belgian, Ysaye.
Actor Will Desmond and his wife booked
their passages for a round trip to U.S. some
weeks ago. Their plans changed at the last
moment, though their names floated into the
list of departed passengers. The cause of
their hugging the land till Saturday last was
the continuous trouble in one of Mrs. Will’s
knees, the result of a slip down a brass-
bound staircase some time ago, the unlucky
joint getting about a baker’s dozen of bangs
in its descent. The Desmonds didn’t revoke
last, week, and left, for ’Frisco in the
Tahiti. The lady will place her bumped
cartilage under the care of a specialist in

■a firm foothold on the American boards.

An unobtrusive musician named 11. Xevill
bmith has been spending a summer holiday
m Sydney. A Victorian by birth, and a cos-
mopolitan by habit, he spent 10 year, in
Europe before settling in M.L. for an inter-
lude. He took charge of a wandering sis-
ter s teaching connection in Timaru in 1910
or thereabouts, as locum-tenens till the lady
returns from a course of singing and other
instruction in Paris. Nevill Smith has a
small waggonload of reminiscences of Berlin
and the lighter frivolities of France. In
Berlin he met Prof. Delmar, an ex-Mel-
bourmte, and now professor of English at
the War Academy and the Uni. in the
Kaiser s chief city. Delmar for a time
edited the Continental Times in Germany.
After getting the appointments just men-
tioned, he passed the newspaper work on to
Jhis sister-in-law, Miss Hook. This daring

Mrs. David’s cheerful chatter about her
trip to Funafuti in 1897, Prof. David being
in charge of the expedition, has recently
been reprinted in an Australian edition.
This slim booklet of 150 pages is to be intro-
duced to the State school child this year, as
a supplementary reader. Several of ’the
more experienced school marms fail to un-
derstand why. The style is breezy, but Mrs.
David never intended it, one imagines, to
be anything but a trivial, ephemeral record
of three months on a coral island, 8 deg.
south of the sunburnt Equator, its chief
interest is the lively account of the writer’s
housekeeping, while the learned members of
the expedition superintended the bores that
drilled holes in the coral atolls. I gather
from Mrs. David’s account of Funafuti that
it has many advantages as a residential isle.
No one knows his own or anyone else’s age.'
There appears to be no census nuisance, no
Man about the Village (the prototype of a
certain type of Man of about Town) to
add a few years on to the score of any
heathen beauty who has snubbed his ad-
vances, and no Funafuti club in which the
Society male discusses the birthdays of Mrs.
Tufaina or Miss Coral Tagasia. Happy
isle! Positively no brown lady knows even
the approximate age of her rival, for she
does not even know her own.
Grace Palotta looks about five-and-twenty
in “The Sunshine Girl.” She wears a foam
of white lace over a maize shimmer in the
first act, and wins the stage-frock competi-
tion by about two lengths. The apron with
voluminous pockets is a feature of the chorus
ladies’ clothes in Act I. Each minx has
pockets enough to complete a small hanging
wardrobe. In these days of no pockets, the
working woman can only writhe with envy
when she sees so many of these lost trea-
sures gathered together in one place. Frank
Greene is singing up to his best form lately.

“Rosna” writes from London :
Another wedding imminent is that of Johanna Red-
mond, whose father leads the Irish party in the House
of Commons and whose mother was one of the Dal-
tons, of Orange. The damsel is a handsome and
brainy girl, with a leaning towards the inky way;
she has written several successful playlets. The
bridegroom is Max Green, chairman of the Prison
Board in Ireland, and late wrap-carrier on Lord Aber-
deen’s staff. This knotting is to be strictly private
and devoid of frills.
Lyn, another of the good-looking Maclur-
can girls, of the fashionable Wentworth
Hotel, is engaged. The man is C. PI. Lane.
Ma Maclurcan some years ago put her cook-
ery recipes into a volume which has become
almost an Australian text-book ; and if she
were writing an introduction to a new edi-
tion she would probably be inclined to repeat
her frequent proud boast that her daughters
know almost as much of the art as she does
herself.

didn’t expect to meet in Harping circles
above. Secondly, the people he did expect to-
see who were unavoidably detained else-
where. The Third Wonder was the fact:
that he slipped through the pearly gates;
himself. Liddle contributes a new setting:
—new to .me, anyhow—of Newman’s “Lead,.
Kindly Light.” Hermann Lohr, one of the-
most persistent writers of music to fit modern
ballads, comes along with “Rose of My
Heart” and “It Was a Song You Sang Me.”
The words of this song are not worth more
than half an encor ■.
Paling’s send a solid helping of music*
of fair to medium merit. Putting sus&fe pan-
tomime music as too liable to emfoorrage' ai
spirit of idleness in this sultry season, E
turned up “Two Sengs,” the music by a
N.S.W. composer, Kathleen Boydell. One
is “Uncertainty,” and the softly sentimental
words are written by a youthful Sydney
girl, M. Scott Shaw (a niece of Miss'Rose
Scott), who has a pretty trick of metre.
Robert Browning’s lines, “But Love.” don’t
fit the girl who sighs for a motor and a sack
of diamonds, but the new setting, by Elsie
M. Cowley, helps the old-fashioned notion
over a musical stile.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

That the hand of our old friend Mr. Davis has not lost its cunning is proved beyond doubt bv
“The Book of Dan,” which has just been published.
Dan, the son of Dad, has grown to man’s estate, and developed many humorous peculiarities
which land him in particularly tight corners, out of which he generally manages to extricate
himself like a veritable Napoleon of the Bush. Dan is a character, and his sense of humor is
not always the same as the other fellow’s, but it will assuredly tickle the reader to tears.
Of this book there is no doubt; it is bound to become a favorite.
Over £lO,OOO worth of “On Our Selection” and “Our
New Selection” have been sold in Australia—a fact
that speaks volumes for their popularity.
Thousands of admirers of Steele Rudd, who could not hitherto afford the
prohibitive price of his books, can now laugh with the best.

Our Exchange Department presents unusual
opportunities. In this department are to be
found pianos bearing the names of the best-
known makers such as Bechstein, Bluthner,
Steck, Ronisch, Feurich, Lipp, etc. These
pianos have come to Pianola Hall in exchange
for the Pianola Piano (the piano that everyone
can play). These have come from the finest
homes—have usually had little or no use, and
are practically undistinguishable from new,
either in musical quality or appearance.

Melbourne, January 27, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
• Tn 16 now engaged catching fish
1! p , asmanian streams, and the photographs
ot his trout are being loyally printed. But,
so tar as I can see, he has not managed to
make fish any cheaper.
On Saturday, at the Exhibition, the Per-
sonages progressed by spasms through the
great crowd that had come to the A.N.A.
Show of Australian Manufactures. Lady
i in , evi<:ie nce. but Mrs.
\\ att, with white lace bows topping a bridal
grey dress, walked with the spruce com-
mander of the Belgian Cadets. Mrs. Hen-
nessy sailed along under full feather rig in
company with her Gaud Mayor. The party
rallied at the impressive timber exhibit, and
made a sortie past boots, cigarettes, marble
pianos and other things, finally fighting their
way clear into the arena, where the refresh-
ments waited under canvas.
t • La £ y i* l j uller and tlle three elder of the
fair half-dozen daughters will sail for Eng-
land by the Moldavia on March 25. After
seeing them safely at school, her Ex. will
return to the Commonwealth, landing in
this city about the last week in October well
supplied with new dresses and London news
(Loesnt it make your eyes ache to look so
tar forward ?) . There was talk of Auntie
1 hipps retreating Londonward; but this
move will probably cancel that trip, and
necessitate the useful lady remaining here
to help Governor Fuller rule the remaining
members of the family.
The one-step, Bunny hug, Turkey trot
etna all tlie other lawless prances which are
then- offshoots are doomed in the land of
J. Bull. They may still prevail for a few
years in Brondesbury, Fulham, etc.—impos-
sible suburbs where _he young men wear red
handkerchiefs in their evening waistcoats,
and the ladies are so genteel that thev feel
taint at the sound of the word d —n; but so
mu as £ ociet y is concerned they are off
Ihe really smart London hostess, following
the Court, will have none of them. Also,
Alls, htuyvesant Fish, who* despite her low-
comedy name, has attained to the position of
accredited leader of the New York Smart
Set, has put the acid on everything from
the Gaby _ Glide to the Duck’s Hop. This
wdl be grim news for the social climbers of
Australia. They have gone to considerable
trouble and expense to learn these dances
and so appear in the movement in the eyes
of Governors, A.D.C.’s and visiting nota-
bilities. Their reward is the reflection that
it they are observed airing their new gifts
they will be set down instantly as social
back numbers. The fact is, things are mov-
ing too. fast. If only someone could get to
the social clock with an axe !
, Society dame, fresh from three years
in the European capitals, throws a bomb on
the card table of the devoted bridge player.
According to the returned traveller, chess is
now the correct dissipation, and before it
even auction bridge is going to the wall.
Ixtled women sit, with knitted brows, con-
sidering an attack upon a castle, or plotting
the downfall of a bishop.
The Repertory Theatre intends to wake up
the public with a matinee revival of “Man
and Superman,” at the Princess’s Theatre,
on Saturday, February 15. The Theatre
Llub will rally for a general annual meet-
ing in the Austral Salon on Friday evening,
January 31, when present members will be
asked to fire in wise suggestions, and intend-
ing members urged to enrol.
Herbert Shaw, a nephew of the famous
Bernard, departed by the Orsova, after
loitering through the Commonwealth, and so-
journing a little while at a seaside place
near Melbourne. He was free from the
idiosyncrasies of manner that hallmark
Uncle, whom he allowed with an Oxford
accent was the family genius. Herbert made
the Australian trip for the benefit of his
heart, and, for the sake of the same organ,
he kept very quiet. His utterly unexciting
recreation consisted of putting his political
opinions on paper.
At the concert with which Richmond fare-
welled Elizabeth Newbold, the audience was
as crowded as the programme. The flow of
music threatened to go on till midnight, or
later, owing to the ceaseless encores. Lizzie
Newbold has a light soprano of fine quality,
and the artistic instinct to back it up. On
the platform she looked like a flower bathed
in sunshine. This attractiveness should help
her nicely in the lands where gilded laurels
grow. Laurels can be gathered in Australia
—Melba got some ere ever she went to
hurope—blit they were not gilded.
The Women’s Political Association has
opened a small shop in the corner of the tea-
rooms in Arlington Chambers where the
she-league has its headquarters. It is like
a bazaar on a modest scale, since it sells
gifts from enthusiastic suffragists and cash-
boxes the proceeds for the £lOOO fund.
Home-made jams, cakes and sweets, home-
made soap, books on the woman question, a
special brand of W.P.A. tea, and hair-nets
seem to be the principal merchandise. The
fund has just been strengthened by a dona-
tion of £lOO from Mrs. Barr Smith ; but they
will need to sell a heap of soap and hair-nets
to make up the balance.
Most of the Bananalanders now in Mel-
bourne (and there are lots of them) get
annoyed when the Victorian moans about
the heat. One loyal northern woman, how-
ever, fresh from a sparkling season in Too-
woomba, says defiantly, “Why, we had to
wear tweeds at the New Year meeting!”
loowoomba is a squattocratic stronghold,
and the Amateur Turf Club’s January gal-
loping draws crowds of people with a claim
to be considered Most Expensive. The Club
gave a big dance on New Year’s Eve, and
supplied every frivoller with iced champagne
and supper to match. Besides this, two of
the smartest squatting wives gave glittering
private dances, whereat the elect waltzed
the hours away. These energetic functions
are advanced by the Northerner as proof
that the maligned Northern climate is not as
hot as the Melbourne imagination.
Judge Real, of Bananaland, with his wife
and son, is pervading Melbourne in a car
tinted like a ripe pineapple. The Judge is a
big, handsome man, and must look impres-
sive, if.not absolutely terrifying, when backed
into his wig.. A daughter, who has the
family’s special brand of good looks, re-
cently married the owner of one of the
richest cattle runs in Bananaland.
London editors manage to extract a good
deal of gratuitous copy out of celebrities
by circularising them on some topical sub-
ject, with stamped. and addressed envelope
for reply. “What is. your most appreciated
Christmas present?” is a sample of this sort
of thing. Ada Crossley answered: “A little
piece of Christmas pudding made and sent
to me here in London by my dear mother in
my distant homeland, in Australia. It
contained a lucky threepenny piece.” From
the same source one draws the information
that mamma Grainger gave Percy a new
guitar to play with—but not for serenading
purposes, I’m sure.
Squatter Clark, of Bananaland, has come
out of the North, to matrimonially carry off
jolly little Elma Akins, of Geelong.
Evelyn Cudmore, who has seen her sisters
led to the altar, has promised to follow suit
with Stan Stogdale, of Melbourne. Miss
Cudmore, who hails from Avoca station, on
the Lower Darling (or is it the middle Mur-
ray?),. was one of the macintoshed crowd
that visited this dripping city last Cup-time.
One of the Murray-Puckle sons and Miss
Burges, of Westralia, are now bracketed on
the engaged list.
Ruby Austin, daughter of the late Edwin
Austin, M.L.C., is smiling sweetly in re-
sponse to congratulations on her engage-
ment to Linsley Smith, late of Buenos
Ayres.
One of the Wesley Hall heiresses, Dora,
a curly-haired girl who has been abroad for
some time, is matrimonially booked to
Major the Hon. George Morris. She is to
become the daughter-in-law of a nobleman
in April.
Edith Morris journeyed to Sydney to wed
her Rev. Irvine. The bride was head-mistress
of the Church of England Grammar School
for flappers, an institution founded by her
mother’s family (the Frenches), and turned
over to the Church by Morris, sen., who held
a cathedral job for 50-odd years. The pair
passed through Melbourne this week on their
way to London, where they will put up for
a year. Gweneth Morris, the bride’s voung-
est sister, on her way back from Westralia,
awaited them at Adelaide to offer congratu-
lations.
Rosna” writes me from London that
artist Penleigh Boyd takes his bride home
to Australia soon. The yarn goes that the
marriage was the result of a picturesque
accident. Boyd and some pals rented Miss
Anderson’s flat in Paris during her absence,
and before they were ready to quit the lady
announced her intention of returning to it.
Hang it all, we 11 have to kill this woman
or marry her,” said Boyd ; and apparently
found the latter course the. more convenient
at the moment, murder being unponular in
Paris just then. “You will notice,” says
‘Rosna,” “that this yarn gives the bride no
say in the matter whatever. But then it
was told me by a mere man.”
“Dudie” Griffiths, the jolly little daughter
of the squattocrat from Albury way. is
booked for what almost amounts to an “al-
liance ” with voung Niall. son of one of the
Goldsbrough-Mort potentates. Papa Niall,
who is a widower, has just returned from a
foreign trip, and Mrs. Rumor cheerfully
alleges that there will be a double wedding
in the family. By the way, the Niall bride-
groom-elect was best man at the recent
I airbairn-Jowett orange-blossoming. This
is the third engagement since January 1
which has been inspired by the wedding
march in the wake of some happy pair.
. A - H. Chambers, the newly-installed chief
inspector of the Union Bank, is sheltering
himself luxuriously in a Toorak house. Mrs.
Chambers is a particularly smart froeker
and, moreover, is possessed of the where-
withal. She was a Miss Ferguson, daughter
of an original Mount Morganaire.
Mrs. Dick Casey sends word to friends of
the gorgeous time she has been having as
guest of the Carmichaels. For a State ball
given in Calcutta on Christmas Eve, the
Australian visitor got a black tulle dress
and wore a showerbath of diamonds. Lady
Carmichael’s dress was blue and green chif-
fon over gold tissue. It sounds more like a
stage costume than the oulit of the quiet
Scotch lady.
Mrs. Jamieson and her sister, Hilda Marr,
two smart frockers in exclusive St. Kilda-
road circles, have cut all engagements, and
are making a sad journey northward to their
Queensland station. Mrs. Jamiesdn’s son
died there suddenly last week; and, as the
place is situated at the back of beyond, the
mourners will only arrive to hear everything
in the past tense.
The Morphetts (he is relieving manager
of the Queensland National Bank, and she
is daughter of one of the directors) like Mel-
bourne so much that they want to stay. The
little matter will probably be arranged for
them. The pair gave a jolly lunch the other
day to the visiting Coldhams (who hail from
Central Bananaland), the widow Clifton,
(Darling Downs), and rich bachelor Mor-
phett (Cloncurry).
Marshall Hall, it seems, is off to take his
Wagner Centenary undiluted in Europe. In
his absence, the duties of Conservatorium
director will fall to Edouard Scharf. Con-
ductor Fritz Hart, a wizard with the vio-
lin, will carry on the harmony lectures.
Colonel Ballenger, lately retired by Field-
Marshal Time, found that he could not settle
down quietly to enjoy his pension. So he
looked round to see how he could work off
his surplus energy, and decided that he
would become commander-in-chief of the
Austral Hotel, Melbourne. The two smart
Ballenger daughters, who are used to riding
over the country on thoroughbred horses, and
generally living the open-air life, were called
upon at short notice to try city existence.
They responded like good sports, and, in the
intervals of housekeeping, helped to put
Dad’s new place to rights.
Dick Ballenger the other day made a dash
through this city on his way from Westralia
to Queensland. He is hurrying north to
manage a Brisbane brewery in which the
Colonel is interested.
The dining-room of the Fairlie House flat-
ter was flowing with champagne and cream
puffs on Wednesday of last week, when Mrs.
h red Keats, of the John Cumming clan, hos-
tessed a feminine luncheon of farewell to the
Hussey-Chomley widow. Dame Madden
topped the guest list. The widow will have
as travelling companion the younger daugh-
ter of “Bill” Weatherly, of Billilla. The
Keats matron will shortly sail Londonward
herself, her two sons being due for a parental
visit.
Melbourne girls are losing bachelor Geoff
Kiddle for a time. He is off to India, ac-
companied by sister Rita, of the copper-
colored hair. They intend to put in an in-
structive travel before returning to Aus-
tralia.
The other day Bertie Power, son of Her-
bert Power, of Toorak, damaged his collar-
bone. Later on he stepped out of a French
window in a rural hotel, and fell 25ft. on to
a pavement. The fact that he is merely in
hospital after such a frightful smash shows
how a little experience in tumbling will save
a man.
. M £ s - Frank Brett, with daughter Eileen,
is off to London next month to personally
mspect the new Clegg baby. Mary Brett
Qlegg, a bride of last summer, is now located
in a London suburb, and has managed to
set °n good terms with some of the Most
£-I Si People; her husband’s income of
±IS,UU(J year keeps the non-social wolf almost
out ot sight and the motors at the door. The
golden Niagara was started by Clegg, sen.,
who was in the cotton business. The old
gentleman left the flow of cash to son Hum-
phrey, who promptly married his Australian
girl, and has since given up soldiering. Mary
herself will probably inherit some money, for
lather has made a pile in land transactions.
A 7, a U la -¥, e . Clty block that now holds Crom-
well Buildings is said to have come into the
family long ago in exchange for a racehorse
or a fast trotter.
Elsie Mackay, now lodged in London
with a sister of stepmama Fan Dango, sends
effervescing accounts of the fun she is hav-
• an P an S°-Mackay goes Londonward
m May to*jom her, and to show “Peter” to
her people, who have never seen the wonder-
ful infant.
Cliveden, the former home of the Clarkes
now turned into flats, is one of the few high-
toned places that don’t object to the young
of man. The Stuart Murrays have their
son there; the Rubber Edwards couple keep
a brace of boys on the handy premises ; and
several young matrons of the Very Best set
are establishing themselves there with their
human pets. John Madden, C.J., plays a
patriarchal part in the cosy coffee lounge
after dinner, patting every child within reach
and generally acting the benevolent great
man.
Somebody sends the news that the ladv
who used to be Mrs. Charlie Wallace is verv
much in evidence at the Ritz, the Carlton
and other haunts of London show diners
She is always beautifully dressed, but invari-
ably has a bored expression.
A matrimonial alliance which hah
confidently forecasted in the Very R
circles seems to have suddenly blown om
and no one tells why. ut >
Society hoisted its left eyebrow the other
day and demanded to know why o ne' of it
moneyed girls wanted to go and thumn !
commercial typewriter for several hours nor

hardly pay for her chocolates. However the
feelings of the rich unemployed m a v he

having intimated that she will think it over
Mrs. “Medlow” Burgess has established a
stylish guestery called “Le Cairo,” which is
going to knock hash off anything of its kind
in sight. The place is right up against the
basement doors of Parliament House
through which members short-cut to the
Council and Assembly.
Artist Hal Waugh has invented and
patented a contrivance for outdoor painting
It is a natty arrangement whereby the easei
is kept from wobbling, and the wet can-
vases (of which two or three can be carried
at a time) are stopped from making them-
selves into sandwiches. Hal’s ingenuity is
bred in the bone. Waugh, senior, now de-
ceased, was a clever engineer.
Some time in March, the Charles McEvoy
pair, with their smart girleens, will repack
their imported garments and move from the
Charlie Ryan abode, which they have ten-
anted since their return from England. Clive-
den Mansions will be their next shelter.
Olive May, the American beauty who has
just married into the nobility, is so mam-
years younger than famous sister Edna that
various cats declared, after her stage debut,
that she was really Edna’s daughter. A
Melbourne doctor who made mud-pies with
the Mav family remembers little Olive
when she was young enough to play
impish tricks with Edna’s many beaux.
Olive, by marrying a Paget, has
made the better match socially, but Edna got
the money. For her honeymoon trip, hus-
band Eewisohn gave her a gold-fitted auto-
mobile. rather like a palace on wheels. Even
King Solomon’s best girl in all her glory was
not conveyed in one of these.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Meningie, on the Lakes, awoke with a yell on
Thursday, and shaking off its normal condition of pro-
found depression, went quite gay. The occasion was
the Warrengie races. “Percy” and K. D. Bowman
carried off most of the prizes, including the Ladies'
Bracelet, which Mr. Arthur Jervois’s riding won for
Mrs. Keith Bowman. A large party arrived from
Campbell House. The Peter Rows came with the
Alan MacFarlanes, who motored over from Welling-
ton Lodge, and Mrs. John Pile and her daughter were
with the Alan Bowmans. The whole racecourse,
socially speaking, had tea with Mrs. Richardson, of
Warrengie station. Her husband is reputed to have
as good an eye for a horse as any coper in S.A.
Meanwhile, in the Angaston-Mount Pleasant dis-
trict, polo was raging furiously, as indeed it does
most days, these prosperous times. The players are
chiefly Angases and Murrays and Melroses and Daw-
sons. Scotchbyterians by origin but sportsmen by
inclination—an example, possibly, of the uses of en-
vironment.
. Miss Lizzie Waite has gone back to England.
Singer Serena Kleinschmidt (a protegfie of the
Waites) is understood to be scanning the horizon,
with a welcoming expression of the eye, in anticipa-
tion of her arrival.
Captain Clare, whose job is to teach the Westralians
naval defence, is here for his daughter’s wedding. It
occurs on Saturday. His future son-in-law is Mr. E.
Angove, offspring of the late vigernon-medico of Tea
Tree Gully. By the way, Mr. and Mrs. Carl Angove
are moving from North Adelaide to Renmark, where
an off-shoot of the business is to be established.
The Bosapquets had a tea and tennis party at
Marble Hill on Saturday, and a luncheon party on
Sunday.
The Adelaide Rowing Club Swimming Carnival
happened in the Glenelg baths on Saturday. Mr. E.
Luxmoore won most of the prizes. The successes of
this young man are getting monotonous. Mr C H
Moon won the test race of half a mile, and will con-
sequently represent S.A. in the Australian champion-
ship swim.
Mr. C. A. .Harnilton, who came second in the
Junior Championship, leaves for Melbourne shortly.
He was given a farewell dinner bv the Club at the
Pier Hotel on the evening of the carnival.
Four of our brightest burglars broke into a grocer’s
shop in Hyde Park on Friday night. After expend-
mg a good deal of energy, dynamite, etc., they were
mortified to find the safe empty. (Loud curses.)
J hev thereupon burst into the grocer’s private house,
the first thing of value which thev encountered here
was the grocer’s wife, who yelled. ’Hie burglars bolted
in wild disorder. Someone hurled a mallee-root at
the largest villain and hit the smallest one (who
was some 15 yards from the other) so hard that he
was observed to totter in his tracks. All the police
have to do now is to find a malefactor nursing an
injured skull. 6
Premier Denham called on us during the week and
told us how we had gone ahead during the last 25
years. He was thereupon fed (1) by the Ministry at
Parhament House, and (2) by the Commonwealth
( luh. There is this point about being a Premier one
need never go hungry. ’

POLITICAL
POINTS
_ Talking about the sinfulness of Protec-
tion, the Argus points out that Germany
last year took £6,000,000 more Australian
goods than Australia took of German goods.
The old dame then maunders:
What must be said of Germany’s conduct in import-
ing from this country such a very much larger amount
of merchandise than it imports from her? To think
that a nation intelligent enough to accept the sound
and comforting creed of High Protection should act
so foolishly!
The Argus doesn’t mention —perhaps it
doesn’t know —-that practically the whole of
the German imports from Australia consist
of raw products. Of wool alone the German
is now taking over £6,000,000 worth a year
from Australia. Enlightened Australia has
the tremendous job of clipping the stuff from
the sheep’s back: the benighted German
chuckles as he piles it aboard his own
steamers, spins it into tweed at his factories,
and then sells it to the Commonwealth for
about 20 times as much as he paid for it.
CLEARING THE TRACE.
Intervention by the Federal power in such circum-
stances was laying the axe at the root of the tree of
State sovereignty. —An indignant Fusionist on
Referendum possibilities.
MAN WITH THE COACH: “ Keep calm , little
one , keep calm. There's a limb or two that
have long been an aggravation and a hind-
rance to my progress , and I'm thinking of
trimming 'em down a bit and"
WEE VOICE (frantically): “ All very fine , all
very fine! But you COULD hack this
beautiful tree down with that horrid weapon
if you WANTED to, so please throw it away
at once!"
Concerning one of 1 ictoria's political has-
beens, a Melbourne daily lately printed the
following pair of headlines : “Alexander Pea-
cock. Remains in State House.” No doubt.
Still there are others who are even deader.
kat got something of a shock at a recent
by-election for Melbourne City Council. He
polled 1623 property owners’ votes, given to
a city iron merchant, while the Labor candi-
date, an almost unknown letter-cutter named
Cohen, scored 1306. It moves.
i- T s?^^^ a ? ian maternity bonus has called
loi ±113,000 in three months. In the same
three months two of the State Premiers and
a third Deputy-Premier have packed their
duds tor London, where they will bite Cohen’s
ear for further loans. What a farce it is to
give the little Australian a bonus with one
hand and a terrific burden of debt with the
other!
Following the lead of the Age, the Bendigo
Advertiser says that “the Opposition union
ot 1 rotectionists and Freetraders was an act
of sophistication, which debased the purity of
I rotectionist representation.” Quite true, of
course. Now, to come right home, what is
the Advertiser going to do about John
Quick, its debased Protectionist represen-
tative?
From a Northern Democrat:—
If Queensland experience goes for anything, it is
much, too early yet for Beeby to crow. The Labor
party s “whole hog’’ policy of helping the Tory who
bates the Labor programme with all his soul, instead
ot assisting the democrat who believes in 90 per cent,
of that programme, has been tried now for six years
in Queensland, with the result that the Democrats
who nearly always voted Labor have been wiped out.
Incidentally, the Tory majority has increased enorm-
ously, and the present Conservative crowd in power
Jo°ks^,]ik e Ly to remain there for many a long day.
But that fact doesn’t trouble the extreme Labor men
They have got the “whole hog’’ policy and their op-
ponents have got the bacon. What more could a
party want ?
Ihe Y\ omen s National League has snared
a courageous but foolish man named Pur-
brick, and persuaded him to contest the
Yarra in the Fusion interest. It would
probably do Frank Tudor good to be strenu-
ously, opposed, and might show him that
association with Freetraders corrupts good
politics; but Purblind isn’t the man for the
job. He means well, but he overlooks things,
lhus he rails at Labor for failing to provide
adequate protection for “existing local in-
dustries”—not a word about the much more
important industries that have no Austra-
lian existence as yet—but he conveniently
forgets that his party includes many Free-
traders, and that the other day a majority of
his party, in secret caucus, chose a Free-
trader as leader in preference to a Protec-
tionist.
From behind the scenes:—
In the election of a leader of the white-ant riddled
Fusion, Jokook polled 20 against Bigjohn’s 19. Out
of 46 all told, 39 turned up (Cameron, the Tas-
manian Senator, having refused to sign the Liberal
caucus pledge, has been struck off the roll.) J. T.
Walker and Simon Fraser, who are quitting politics,
did not attend. Josh Symon said nothing and didn’t
come either. Greene and Harper were ill. Banana-
land Edwards, also retiring, thought it didn’t con-
cern him. Deakin hadn’t the same scruples ; he was
there. Millen was Joe’s chief henchman, with Willie
Kelly as bottle-holder. Not until the chairman de-
clared the count was the result sure. N. S. Wales
polled seven for Joe and two for John, Victoria four
against eight, Queensland four to one. Westralia
threw all its votes for John, and the S. Aus. and Tas-
manian voting was equal.
During the sparring before the second
ballot for the Blayney (N.S.YV.) seat, event-
ually recaptured by Beeby, the oldest in-
habitant of a hamlet called Vittoria was
unearthed. The ancient told the story of an
election of 30 years ago, when the lonely
place, which only had 20 names on its roll,
was overrun with vehicles loaded with grog
and electors from distant parts. Vittoria
had missed the proper election day through
the non-attendance of the returning officer,
so the whole countryside rallied to the attack
regardless of rolls or anything else. Dead
men rose from their graves to vote at that
election, live ones were dragged from their
beds for the same purpose, and £2OO worth
of liquor was swallowed. When 500 or so
votes had been honorably recorded, the booth
was closed with a screwjack or something,
and the heated multitude tore down the
fences, and had a sort of pitched battle in
the dusk. His story done, the oldest inhabi-
tant sighed regretfully, and said that it was
a great day for the village, and the country
had now gone to the dogs.
In view of the remote possibility of a
M ade-Wood Ministry coming *to power after
next N.S.W. election, two Disraelis are mak-
ing strong running to be in it —Dan Levy
and J. J. Cohen. Both have the main essen-
tial for Cabinet position, viz., an apparently
safe seat, and both have a record for inor-
dinate talkativeness which is only excelled
by Wood and Fitzparrot on their own side.
Levy had a brilliant public school and a fair
University and law school record, but has
since faded away. Cohen is a strenuous man,
good tempered, not much of a debater, but
very persistent; and he has a weakness for
believing that he resembles Barton—facially,
of course. He came into prominence as a
whole-souled fighter for Federal union; but
he has tailed off since then into a confirmed
State Frighter—a melancholy result of get-
ting himself down to the intellectual level of
a suburban electorate where there are 14
pocket-handkerchief municipalities in about
two square miles of Austx-alian territory.
“The Wild Colonial Pressman”: I never
attend a political banquet without recalling
that inspiration of Goldsmith’s : “Those who
came to scoff remained to bray.”
“Politicus”: I was talking recently to one
of our newly-arrived immigrants about things
in the Cold Land. “People are leaving in
thousands,” he said. “The thing that riles
a Britisher is, not so much that want of
employment is the chief cause of this awful
loss of citizens, but that Continental im-
ports choke the market. The day our vessel
left. I saw at Tilbury Docks a cargo of 2000
coffins landed direct from Germany.” Ex-
porting men and importing coffins! Free-
trade in a nutshell!
Austin Chapman’s flank action in turning
up at the Liberal Caucus to help elect
Deakin’s successor was expected—by a few.
Last election Chapman was unopposed in
token of Labor’s appreciation of the Chap-
man grain sack. This coming election,
Labor has announced its intention to contest
the seat, so Chapman, still a sick man, rec-
koned things would be made easier if he
came down from the fence and collected the
support of one party or the other. He chose
that one whose device represents the Aus-
tralian being slowly smothered by the im-
ported goods of the‘sweated toiler of Europe,
Asia and America.
On an illuminated hoarding erected on the
site of the future Commonwealth Building
at the eastern end of the Strand, London,
George Reid displays “Australia’s Daily
Message.” This consists of a sentence in
movable wooden letters setting forth some
striking item of news calculated to hit the
passer-by in the eye and encourage him to
emigrate. Sometimes the High Billposter
seems to get gravelled for matter, and puts
up queer assertions. For instance, on
December 10, he proclaimed: “The small
percentage of applicants for the maternity
bonus is an indication of Australia’s re-
markable prosperitv.” It might be an in-
dication of a lot of other things as well —
of maternal bashfulness, of ignorance as to
the modus operandi, of false pride, or of
pure cussedness. But, as a simple matter of
fact, the “small percentage” isn’t true. It
is the large percentage that is surprising the
Government, in view of the preliminary
howl about the “degradation” of the
“bonus.”
THE SAME OLD ASS.
He warned them not to be led away by the new
dress; for, after all, it was the same old donkey.—
Premier Peake, on the new Referenda proposals.
(THE BULLETIN trusts it hasn't misunderstood
Mr. Peake.)
Customs Minister Tudor is trying to dis-
courage the use of flannelette by displaying
placards at the A.N.A. Melbourne Hygienic
Exhibition, and by authorising practical de-
monstrations of its inflammability. This
paper may live to yet see punishment for
murder abolished in favor of lessons on the
deadness of murdered corpses.
In the matter of Defence the Tory coat
seems to be completely inside out at last.
Says the S. M. Herald :
We are not always able to see eye to eye with
the present Federal Government, but in matters of
Defence it has shown a most enlightened attitude.
The direct reason for this generous outburst
is the decision to get men from the British
army to be instructors. The moment the
notion of importing something penetrated the
Tory mind, round went the coat, with all its
lining showing.
The fighting platform of the Jokook party
is as vague as the policy of a party of odds
and ends might be expected to be. It sets
forth: —
(X) That the policy of the present Commonwealth
tariff, as determined by the electors, be maintained.
(The match-makers, thrown out of the closed-down
factory, will be glad.)
(2) A permanent non-political body to be estab-
lished, having statutory authority to supervise and
report to Parliament respecting industrial production,
etc.
(3) Restoration of Responsible Government. (This
means, no doubt, abolition of the caucus. It was a
caucus that elected Joe Cook.)
(4) Sound finance. (J. Cook learned this brand of
finance no doubt from his former chief, G. H. Reid.)
(5) Electoral reform, to secure the better represen-
tations of majorities. (Hooray ! This means Unifica-
tion, if it means anything.)
(6) Industrial legislation, to obtain inter-State uni-
formity as far as is equitable. (And note how hard
the Jocook party barracks for the Referendum pro-
posals, which are designed to get it.)
(7) Old age pensions to be retained. (Marvellous
magnanimity.)
(8) National insurance. (And don’t mention the
Socialistic tiger.)
(9) Government and development of the Territories
on sound and progressive lines. (Which mav mean
anything, from colored labor to shindycatism ■ or
nothing at all.)
Why doesn’t the party frankly boil it all
down into a banner with the true device -
“On to the Tartshop!”
THE FIRE-FIGHTER.

at Potsdam. The German Emperor assisted to ex-
tinguish the outbreak. — Cable.

Colonel Owen, Kink O’Mal-
ley’s Director - General of
Works, is the latest champion
of the Cotter —the river where
the trout are suffocated with
mud and captured by hand.
Says the quite disinterested
Owen : “There is enough water
going down the Cotter to sup-
ply with storage a city of the
size of Melbourne.” But, then,
dear, dusty Melbourne is al-
ready supplied from other
sources, so there is no danger
of the Cotter being put to the
test. These large assertions by
the river’s champions would be
listened to with more respect if
those painfully frank fishing
correspondents who wrote of
strings of waterholes and chok-
ing fish had been contradicted,
or sacked, or boiled. A few
impressive drowning statistics
even might moisten the outlook.
But no such evidence of wet-
ness has been produced. Per-
haps G.-G. Denman might be
able to _ silence the critics by
ceremoniously drowning a dog
when he goes along to christeD
the place.
The Maoriland Telegraph
Department recently held a
sale of old stock in Christ-
church. Table telephones were knocked
down at 6d. each ; wall telephones averaged
a shilling. Now what price will the railway
stock, on which Cohen’s interest must still
be paid, realise when invention has kept
moving for another 20 years? Mechanical
property is no permanent asset these days.
The Right-thinking section of the com-
munity will be glad to hear that the Hobart
cemetery which recently adopted the sanitary
practice of digging up partly-decayed corpses
and burning them, was run by Private Enter-
prise. By comparison, how wasteful is the
average municipal depot! If a grave gets
full —why, the authorities nearly always in-
sist upon the sexton digging another one.
This paper has often said that a certain
variety of Liberal is, at heart, a violent
anarchist, and the older it gets the surer it
becomes of the fact. For example, last
week the Liberal party in the Common-
wealth Parliament met in Caucus to elect a
leader. Before, leaving for Melbourne to
take part in this business, Colonel Ryrie,
M.P. (whose speciality, according to himself,
is the capacity to administer stoush like any
hottle-o lad) was reported by the Sydney
dailies as follows :
If there is any move to do Mr. Cook out of the
leadership there will be trouble at that meeting.
And that trouble will come from me, and I can tell
you that I can break up any political meeting in the
world.
No. wonder that frail lightweight, W. 11.
Irvine, hastened to announce that he had no
intention of “doing Mr. Cook out of the
leadership” of the push, and that rather than
be suspected of anything of the sort he would
withdraw from the fray.
TO WORK!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“And now,” said he, “to work!” —Sydney D. T.
interview with Joe Cook, 24/1/T3.
“And now to work!” says Cook. Yes, yes! we like
this cheery bustle.
The time is ripe and over-ripe—’tis time to doff
our coats.
Come,- light the fire and start the wheels, for we have
got to hustle,
Or else the busy foreigner will cut our trading
throats !
Take down the shutters, speed the loom, and set
the chimneys smoking ;
Let engines hum and waggons roll, and whistles
call to toil;
When drags the Symphony of Work, ’tis time to stop
our joking
And start the clashing music with a touch of
honest oil.
“And now to work!” You bet we will! We’re sick
and tired of talking!
It’s time to get a move on now 1 Let’s mend that
Tariff wall!
But what is this ? Our rushing boss has stopped !
Our Joe is baulking!
This sudden, frenzied jibbing we can’t understand
at all!
He called for “Work” ! He also seemed impatient to
be doing—■
And, Heaven knows, there’s work enough to keep
him on the wing!
But in a corner see him now his Freetrade whiskers
chewing—-
O Joe, where is thy energy! O Cook, where is
thy spring!

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The inter-State 18ft. handicap on Port
Jackson (N.S.W.) on Saturday afternoon was as
exciting as any ever seen on that famous water.
Twenty-three faced the starter on a balmy, easy
breeze; but long before the race was over a wild
southerly burst over them, snapping masts like car-
rots, rolling boats right over, and in some cases
blowing masts and gear right out and overboard.
Of the 23 that set out only one crossed the line, and
that one was the Westana, the Perth boat which
had run second to Kismet when N.S.W. won back
the championship and the Foy Cup the previous Sat-
urday. When so experienced a master of the game
as Christian Webb gets blown right over in the Har-
bor he knows better than anyone else on earth, it
speaks volumes for the Westralian captain that
he lived through the terrific wind burst, and
crossed the line, sole survivor as well as victor.
Another boat which made a splendid effort was the
Queensland craft Colonial. Golding, with peak low-
ered, struggled up to Clark Island buoy, followed by
Australian and Colonial, in that order. The first
two approached it as the tailor did the sac coat,
cautiously, and played for safety by going in stays.
Colonial came with a rush, bravely, jibed and swung
the sail across amidst a thunder of cheers that
drowned the howling of the gale, and got round
safely. But Fate was waiting, and the northern boat
was plunging past Bradley's Head, when one sudden
gust lifted mast and sails right overboard; and the
plucky boat was a wreck. But wrecks were plentiful
that afternoon.
The gale that blew across Sydney Harbor
on the Saturday completelv wrecked the Sabbath
which followed it, for the fleet of 18-footers which
was smashed and scattered by 5 p.m. on Saturday,
came up smiling, spick and span, in spite of snapped
masts and all the rest of it, at the Anniversary Re-
gatta on Monday. Two inter-State handicaps were
run off, and Australian, which on Saturday was blown
right over, won both, and thereby healed the broken
heart of the veteran Christian Webb. In the second
race he had to go for all he was worth, and it is
doubtful if he would have got home even then had not
Kismet, through piling on another ounce, capsized
just as it leaped for the line. It was an exciting
finish.
* * * *
While the 18ft. squadron was being blown
to pieces on Sydney Harbor, excitement was begin-
ning to simmer in Perth over the 14ft. and 10ft.
inter-State events which had been set down for Anni-
versary Day. Monday found a stiff breeze blowing
over the Swan River when 10 starters lined up for
the 14ft. affair. The Sydney boat Rene, running
from scratch, slowly overhauled the fleet, passed
them one by one, and struggled out a winner with
15sec. to spare from Crusader, with Edna third ;
both of these were scratch boats. In the 10ft. tussle
the breeze was over-strong, and the local Britannia
and a N.S.W. boat called Wheatear were blown over.
Again it was a Sydney boat, the Waratah, which
won, and did it with the handsome margin of five
minutes from four others.
* * * *
A curious coincidence at the Sydney Anni-
versary Regatta was the ending of the race between
the cutters from the cadet sh’p Tingira. Three of
them raced from Bradley’s Head to the flagship, and
at the finish No. 1 cutter was first, No. 2 second
and No. 3 third.
**. * *
As expected, the detailed accounts of
Gunn’s record-breaking motor-bike run from Svdney
to Melbourne prove it to have been something in the
derring-do line of business. His actual running time
was about 23 hours, and the 24 hours record was
spoiled only by the hideous state of the road after
leaving Benalla, where sand drifts and broken timber
produced many falls, and the constant use of the ex-
haust lever caused too much oil to work past the
piston rings and foul the sparking plug. During the
last stages Gunn suffered severely in his wrists, which
gave signs of losing all power owing to the strain of
heavy falls and the vibration. When he left Sydney
at two o’clock on the Saturday morning, he was ac-
companied by .T. Booth, another Melbourne rider who
had previously been over the road, which Gunn had
not. Booth smashed up between Yass and Gundagai,
and Gunn went on alone. At Winton, where he
arrived somewhere before 8 p.m., 135 miles from Mel-
bourne, he found two cars, representing the Dunlop
and Vacuum Oil Companies, waiting for him. The
fierce light of their acetylene lamps alone made riding
over some parts of the road possible. It was 3.55
a.m. when he arrived at Melbourne Post Office, after
being exactlv 23 hours in the saddle. Booth, after
his smash., fixed up his machine and went in pursuit
of his friend, and arrived at Albury an hour after
the friend had left. Then he abandoned all attempt
on the record.
The Sydney-Melbourne motor-bike record
now stands thus :

D. Campbell, who has been heard of before
with his 40-li.p. Vinot, proposes to make another
attack on G. G. White’s Sydney-Melbourne motor-car
record during February. And our beauteous artistic
motorist, Allen Doone, who has likewise been heard of
before, will also undertake the task in a 40-h.p.
National. White’s record, by the way, is 19hr.
47min. This record-breaking business is a splendid
idea—for the people who sell motor-cars.
The cycle car has made its appearance in
Australia, and a weird-looking little contraption it is.
But, presumably, like-D.T.’s. they run in all shapes.
The first that appeared in Sydney nearly caused one
worthy citizen to take a fit. He was of a party
returning from a scampering jamboree on the Blue
Mountains, and the car, a big, high-powered Fiat,
had just turned into George-street from the Newtown-
road. Suddenly the worthy citizen heard a sort of
coughing sound, and, looking over the side, he beheld
a tiny car running on small bicycle wheels, and con-
taining two people, who seemed to be quite comfort-
able. He stared at it; then .softly closed his eyes,
and stared again. It was. still there, coughing
merrily along. The citizen leaned over the front
and gasped into the chauffeur’s ear: “Shay, ole
fellow, don’t maksh pace too hot; this thing’s had
er pup, an’ poor pup ’as been boarded by two louts.
Stopsh and sling ’em out—or don’ go too fast.”
Then he fell back among the upholsterv, and held a
conversation with himself about the high pitch to
which motor-cars had been brought. Every few
seconds he would look over the side at the pup. He
nearly took the fit when he saw it slither down a side
street and lose its parent.
The Melbourne Six-Days’ Bicycle Race
will be held on the Exhibition track from February
24 to March 1, inclusive. The Melbourne Bicycle
Club is the promoter, and, between drinks, it will
run off the Austral AVheel Race and some other sprint
events. A third of the gross takings is to be ear-
marked for prize money ; the Austral is expected to
be about £l5O, and the first prize of the Six Days’
should work out at something between £4OO and
£SOO if the club’s expectations are fulfilled. Only
14 teams will be accepted, and entries close with the
L.V.W., 243 Collins-street, Melbourne, February 17.

A boon and a blessing to motorists lias
just been put on the market in the shape of a vacuum
cleaning attachment, operated by the exhaust gases
passing through a suitably designed nozzle and
vacuum chamber. As the gases rush through they
create a suction in the hose as they leave the nozzle
and pass the vacuum chamber, and dirt and dust are
picked up by the cleaning brush and fired into the
atmosphere through the exhaust tube —just the bar-
ber’s hand spray over again in a rather elaborate
form. The apparatus is installed in the same man-
ner and placa as the ordinary muffler cut-out valve,
by cutting out a short section of the exhaust pipe
ahead of the muffler. All the time the engine is run-
ning the cleaner can be working, so that at the end
of a long run the machine should arrive clean and
free from dust in the parts that matter. After that
the chauffeur and his charges just line up, the ap-
pliance is run over them also, and they march into
the pub, clean, wholesome, spick and span. A great
idea!
When Gunn set up the new motor-cycle
record between Sydney and Melbourne, he beat by
seven minutes the time in the Dunlop Military
Despatch ride last Easter. Instead of scaring off
competitors, Gunn’s gruelling performance has stimu-
lated a small army to make an attempt on the gold
watch offered by the Dunlop Cos. to the first man to
do the trio in 24 hours. Also, a voice has flown over
from South Aus. asking the co. to have the prize and
conditions made applicable to a ride from Adelaide
to Melbourne. The distance is practically the same,
and, although they are very different, the difficulties
of both runs are about equal. Anyhow, they are
both the devil, wherefore, according to Euclid, they
must be the same. Q.e.d. The co. has decided that
if the watch cannot be won between Sydnev and Mel-
bourne by the end of this month, the offer will be
extended to the Adelaide-Melbourne run.
“Hermes”: The man who has been hard
hit by the depredations of the petrol-making pirates
may begin to take heart of grace. There is now dis-
tinct hope of a cheap substitute in the form of benzol,
which is obtained from coal. When one remembers
that in England alone 70,000.000 gallons of petrol
are used every year, one begins to get a glimmering
of the harvest the petrol pirates have made. By the
Del Monte process benzol can be obtained so cheaply
that it can be retailed at lOd. per gallon. One col-
liery in England is laying down a plant to produce
7,000.000 gallons per annum; and others are about
to follow suit. Benzol is not only cheaper than
petrol, but it is more powerful. No doubt, immedi-
ately danger threatens, the petrol pirates will lay
themselves out to crush the new industry by the
usual Trust methods; but they will find themselves
faced by a very strenuous opposition. If only
15,000,000 tons of the annual English coal output of
265,000,000 tons is devoted to benzol, no petrol need
be imported to Great Britain. The same thing
applies to Australia; N.S.W. alone could produce
enough benzol to make importations of petrol un-
necessary. A thumping duty on the spirit would
throw practically the whole of the money now sent
abroad into Australian pockets, and create a fairly
big industry.

Another Sydney-to-Melbourne Reliability
Test for motor-cars is looming on the horizon. The
N.S.W. Automobile Club approves of it, and so does
the Victorian body. The N.S.W. crowd is in favor
of a four days’ contest over the old route; the Vic-
torian club favors a five days’ tussle via the South
Coast, through Bega, Cooma and Tumut. The latter
has the advantage of being a far more picturesaue
run. Also, on account of the hilly nature of the
country, it would provide a much better test. There
is also a chance that a team competition, N.S.W. v.
Victoria, will be included in the outing.
A women’s rowing-club in Adelaide, call-
ing itself the Original, claims to be the first in Aus-
tralia to go in for inter-State rowing, feminine
variety. It has sent a four to Melbourne for the
Albert Park regatta of this week. The names may
go on record: Moyes (stroke), two Sullivans and
Beada. All are under 9st.

“0.K.”: An Ararat (Vic.) hotelkeeper
has triumphantly asserted his right to bet his cus-
tomers “something to nothing” on a horse race. The
charge was that he, on his own licensed premises, did
issue coupons undertaking to pay £1 to any thirsty
prophet who succeeded in placing the first three horses
of the Melbourne Cup. Five customers won the “quid,”
one of them marking two coupons correctly, and get-
ting payment for each. For the prosecution, it was
contended that the customers practically paid the
price of a drink for each coupon, wherefore the land-
lord was betting them £1 to 6d., or £1 to a “tray”
that they couldn’t place ’em for the Cup. The de-
fence argued that the customers paid just the ordin-
ary price for their liquor. The local Bench decided
in favor of the defence, which decision seer-wth
good. The drink was bought for ordinary drinking
purposes; it represented the same usual value for
cash as any other drink supplied at the pub. On the
other hand, the landlord was conducting neither a
sweep nor a raffle, nor was he giving a guarantee that
he would pay away any money in prizes. He was
certainly not infringing the law that suppressed the
coupon system in shops, where every coupon issued
had a definite value. As for the argument that the
pub-keeper was a gambler in the same degree as a
bookmaker, the latter sells only a wager, which will
probably be worthless to the purchaser. The pub-
keeper sold a drink at its recognised price, and threw
his wager in. There must be two parties to a gam-
bling transaction, and in this case the customers
didn’t gamble at all. Their grog merchant bet them
“something to nothing.” Everyone is licensed to
do that. A bookmaker might do it on the steps
of a cathedral without breaking the law. P.S. —-
Against the decision of this Court there is no appeal.
James Wattie, one of Maoriland’s fine old-
time jockeys, weighed in for the Death Stakes at
Auckland the other day. Back in 1874 he steered Tem-
pleton to victory in the Auckland Cup, and for about
10 years after that rode winners of most of the classi-
cal races. Although his riding days were long over,
he died, figuratively speaking, in a' stable.
An effort to pick winners at the A.J.C.
Anniversary meeting by meteorological sie-ns fell just
as fiat as the old baked-dumpling device. On Satur-
day, with a record temperature of 100.9, punters
pinned their faith to Hot Air in the Challenge
Stakes, but the brute failed badly. On Monday,
with a southerly blowing refreshingly, Cool Air was
heavily supported in the Flying " Handicap, but
reached only third place. Punting on horses is evi-
dently a science which cannot be solved by signs,
wonders and dreams—a fact the large-voiced Solo-
mon McTavish is thoroughly aware of.
Remittancer”: London papers announce
the death of Crudon, winner of the 1901 Grand
National at Aintree. It was the most awful race, as
regards weather and falls, I ever saw. Snow and
sleet were sweeping across the course from the sea,
and it was likewise freezing. I was wearing the
only decent fur coat I ever owned and I couldn’t
keep warm. What must have been the sensations of
the horsemen faced with the prospect of negotiating
nearly five miles of the biggest country in the world,
practically in the buff! Seasoned performers like
Arthur Nightingall and “Snip” Ripley fortified
themselves with jumping powder, in the form
of alleged old brandy, without restraint. Coventry,
the starter, went out to sample the course, having
previously announced that he meant to give it a
clean bill of health whatever it looked like. The
prevailing hope on the part of the jockeys, both
amateur and professional, was that he would break
his neck. He jumped his horse, a safe old hunter,
over a fence near the stand. The gallant animal,
having slipped in the take-off, hit hard, pecked badly,
slid about 14 feet and then by some miracle recovered
itself. Coventry cantered back, announced that the
course was in splendid order, and the horses went out.
Bletsoe, Grudon’s trainer, had spent the previous
ten minutes feverishly filling his charge’s feet with
butter. The idea was to prevent the snow caking in
them. It was a good move. Half the others fell
because their feet were unmanageable after the first
mile. Grudon, jumping faultlessly, won with con-
siderable ease, leaving a mass of fallen and dead
horseflesh in his wake. During a considerable part
of his career he worked in a milk-cart; in fact, his
owner, a farmer, first saw him between the shafts.
He bought him for £3O, and won with him a dis-
tinction which kings have striven for in vain.
“Ex-Englishman” : Re the two pars
about starting-price betting (B. 16/l/’l3), England
does most of its betting on horses it never sees;
and Australia doesn’t get the long prices about
outsiders that the papers name as on offer. The
London club-frequenter doesn’t want to be troubled
to find out what is a fair price about his fancy; and
millions —literally millions—-of factory hands, etc.,
know they have no hope of findin"' out. So the club-
frenuenter puts his fiver, and the others put their
halfcrown, or coppers, on So-and-so at starting-price.
“S.P.” have thus become about the most familiar
initials in all Britain. The sums wagered on a
course are the merest trifles compared with those
booked by big business-like offices in town,. or on
the Continent. When a 20 to 1 chance has won, the
Australian Isaac likes to have it given out that the
price was 50 to 1 ; and reporters are not too particu-
lar about verifying the figure—for what does it
matter? But in England all Isaacdom would be
eager to have the vast stay-at-home public told it
was 12 to 1. The pressman whose duty it is to
assess the odds for the one or two sporting papers
whose “S.P.” is accepted as final, is, therefore, a
tremendously important person.
Meanwhile, tricks are rampant. The one desire of
the modern owner, with a good thing not widely
known, is to rush in an immense backing commis-
sion, spread over a dozen “S.P.” offices, so close before
the race that they won’t have time to wire to the
course, lav off there, and so reduce the “S.P.” It is
no swindle, but lust Business. If he can block the
only available line by wiring the whole Book of
Genesis himself, he is only doing what war-corres-
pondents have been praised for doing. One of the
biggest recent jobs of the kind was directly aided
bv Providence, which sent such an electrical dis-
turbance all up and down the Thames valley that no
telegraph or telephone would act for half an hour,
and so the horse went out almost unbacked (on the
course). Then there are the plain swindles such as
t P p R o f. Tli e big offices receive, by wire
or letter, hundreds of bets after the race, and accept
them all, if they might reasonably have been des-
patched before it. Hence much clever fraud, and
purchase of the souls of pound-a-week post and tele-
graph officials. Nothing but the Totalisator —which
the man to be present on the course, with
the money, before the gong sounds—will wipe out all
th ; s swindle-encouraging system.

A record from “sleepy Castlemaine”
(Vic.), where H. Iredale knocked up 263 runs
(not out), in a district cricket match, in three hours
25 minutes. The district’s next best (254 not out)
was made by J. D. Edwards, at Bendigo, in 1888.
But one afternoon was not enough for him. Iredale
must know something about the game. Although
quite young, he has 23 century scores to his credit.
* * * *
It is doubtful if Trumper was ever in
better form than at present. After failing in the
southern tour with a miserable 46 in four innings
versus S.A. and Vic., he returned to Sydney and
slogged 201 against S.A., 102 in a club fixture, and
138 against Vic. But he isn’t the wizard of old.
The fancy shots are among the relics; it is in the
solid work that he is shining now.
One of the humors of the day is the effort
of a clique to drag “Mary Ann” Noble back nnto
the front rank of first-class cricket, per medium of
the Trumper benefit match. “Noble will probably
play if he is asked,” said one ingenuous scribe.
Under the circs, it was a fair thing for Noble to
offer; and if he will not offer, the selection com-
mittee should be quite able to lay its hands on
enough good players to make the match the success
all wish it to be, without crawling to anyone.
But for Armstrong’s 118 in the first inn-
ings, Victoria’s chances in the Sheffield Shield match
would have been hopeless from the first. With even
that solid foundation to work on, the southern team
smacked only 274, and of the 106 made by the rest of
the team Sundries contributed 12. Ma’s reply was
terrific. Trumper slashed up 138 and Eric Barbour
146, and the rest of the team smacked 193, making
477 for the innings. With a deficiency Of 203 on the
first innings, V ictoria started on an almost impossible
second innings. But the team was full of sand, and it
played the game. Up till Monday night not a cen-
tury had come to its rescue, yet when the stumps
were drawn 335 had been accumulated for nine wic-
kets ; so with one to fall the team had 132 in hand.
The position looked hopeless. And hopeless it was.
The last Victorian wicket saw 30 added, and the
score was as the days of the year, 365. This left
N.S.W. with only 163 to get to win. They were got
at the cost of two wickets, Macartney carrying his
bat for 76, and Bardsley doing likewise for 46. Eric
Barbour made 30 and Ivelleway and Sundries seven
and four respectively. So N.S.W. won by eight
wickets.
An interesting feature of the cycling at
Sydney Cricket Ground, on Monday night, was the
international teams race, wherein McNamara, Spears
and Don Kirkham represented Australia, while Apple-
hans, Rosseau and Jenkins rode for anew Triple
Alliance of England, France and Germany. The dis-
tance was a mile and pace was laid on. When the
pacer dropped out Rosseau took Applehans to the
front and began to carve speed. But Kirkham re-
sponded, and the Australians fastened to his wheel
and made a brave showing. As they rounded into the
straight McNamara went to the front, followed bv
Spears and then Applehans. McNamara won by a
length from Spears, who beat Applehans by inches
So Australia was on top.
Last week, or the week before, Johnson
allowed his motor-cars to be seized and sold to satisfy
a judgment, and declared himself stone motherless
broke and financially down and out. Presumably
he wanted to see how much sympathy, moral and
practical, he was likely to get. He seems to have
got none. The next news was that he had descended
upon a most exclusive resort somewhere in Wyoming
bought a charming house there, and presented it to
his latest and most beloved wife, who used to be
Lucille Cameron, as a place of refuge for her at the
birth of her half-caste child. Poor little kid!
Dick Williamson, Adelaide’s boxing boss
has thrown in the towel, and does not intend to pro-
mote contests in the future. He was disgusted over
the Doran v. Lister fight on New Year’s Night.
These two merely prodded one another for if)
minutes, and the crowd was naturally unanimous
that the men did not try. Some of the mud that
was thrown at them stuck on the promoter, and he
didn’t like it.
“Down an’ Out”: I always understood
that the habit men have of kissing one another was
restricted to Frenchmen, drunks and so forth. But
I find it isn’t. At the Melb. Athletic Pavilion, last
week, pugs. Alf Goodwin and Frank O’Grady met
and smote each other hard for 17 rounds; and bv
that time O’Grad.v was so sorely damaged that the
referee (E. Fullalove—nice name for a boxing re-
feree) ordered O’Gradv into dock, and declared Good-
win the winner. That’s all right. But when Good-
win discovered that he had won, he forgot about his
gore-stained countenance and bleeding nose, careered
up to his trainer and threw his arms round his neck
and kissed him. Then he treated his seconds to an-
other blood-stained peck apiece, and anyone who ap-
proached him to congratulate him was similarly
smeared. After all, is the “gentle art” really a
training for a Dorcas meeting?
* * * *
The ring-passing of Hock Keys, probably
the finest boxer in the world—said by those who have
seen both to be quite equal to the late Joe Gans—
took place on Saturday night at Sydnev Stadium
He was up against Frank Picato, and was giving awav
about half a stone in weight. At the first he got
all over the Italian from America, and gave one of
the best exhibitions of sparring ever seen in the
Rushcutter’s Bay ring. But early in the fight he
found out that his blow's made no impression upon
the gritty youth before him. Poor Kevs"never had
much of a punch, and he had lost whatever he once
had. Once or twice when Picato rushed in he met
straight lefts which had some sting in them, but the
sting came from Picato’s own rush. In the fifth
Picato caught Keys on the point of the chin, and
Keys all but fell; but when Picato stood in to finish
him, his marvellous skill enabled him to block a
shower of blows till the gong w'ent. The feature of
the fight was Keys’s defence. Over and over again
Picato got him on the ropes and slogged away, only
to have every blow taken on gloves and arm. Yet
it was rather a pitiful exhibition. Kevs was quite
incapable of offensive action, and could only defend
himself by interposing gloves and arms to' Picato’s
blows. Picato proved himself to be the most generous
opponent, and was obviously determined not to
knock out a man who was palpably done, though
he could have smashed him over and over again.
He vvas quite content to win on points, and merely
sent in blows which would count without domg Keys
anv great harm. Keys was given every chance to
pull himself together, but at the end of the 12th
round he saw his case was hopeless and the towel
fluttered into the ring as the gong sounded for the
resumption of hostilities.
* * * *
Monday was a perfect day for surf-bathing
m Sydney, but before long the beaches at Manly
and Bondi were crowded with people whom wild
horses wouldn’t drag into the water. For the coast
was being raided by that variety of Portuguese man-o’-
war known as the blue-bottle. The waves were
loaded with them, and the surfers gave up bathing
and smashed the nuisances with sticks and boots, and
buried them in the sand. Some of the children were
bad] v stung. It begins to look as though the surfer
will .have to dress from neck to heel to avoid the
raverting monsters ; and the presence of broken bottles
on our .sand beaches makes the wearing of shoes
almost imperative. The man who breaks class or
china on any beach should first be dragged over it at
the tail of a donkey, then heavily fined, and finally
jugged for three months.
Dan Green, of Sydney, achieved a wonder-
tul sporting feat the other day, and nobody was more
surprised than the striker. Dan has been going in for
un?* a t Albert Park (Melb.), and a phenomenal
was ambition. He realised his ambition
with one fell practice swipe. The ball’s flight was in-
terrupted by a swooping swallow and the bird fell
dead. The old story of the cricket ball that killed a
sparrow can consider itself snuffed out.

Lieut. Petre has just arrived in Melbourne
as instructor of the Australian Flying Corps
at £400 a year. The chief is Major White,
who will be Director of Intelligence. The
second instructor, Lieut. Harrison, a native
of Victoria, will shortly arrive from England
with four aeroplanes, purchased for £3200.
Harrison formerly worked in Melbourne as
a motor mechanic; he went to England and
learned flying on the advice of Busteed, an-
other Australian, now one of the best-known
airmen in England. The Australian flying
corps will consist of four officers, seven
warrant-officers and sergeants, and 32
mechanics, or a total of 43. The aerodrome
is to built at the Duntroon training centre,
within Federal capital territory.
A new edition of “Ironbark’s” verses is
to come along in a few weeks. “Ironbark,”
when he isn’t writing his cheerful lines, is
G. H. Gibson, an inspector in the N.S.W.
Lands Department for 17 years past. But
he has been a lot of other things. Until
his distaste for the law got the better of
him he was a solicitor in England; then,
starting to rove, he wandered through Maori-
land and over the backblocks of Queensland
and N. S. Wales, where he put in six years
learning bushcraft. From there he drifted
into press work in Sydney; he started to
contribute to The Bulletin with its first
issue in 1880. He now has three volumes
of verse to his credit, and the lot that will
appear in “Ironbark Splinters” are the best
he has done.

What especially distinguishes
Odol from all other mouth-cleansing prepara-
tions is its unique antiseptic property.
After the mouth has been rinsed with Odol
an all prevading influence spreads itself im-
perceptibly over the whole of the interior of
the mouth, exerting its power for hours.
It is this lasting effect (which no other pre-
paration possesses) that gives to daily users
of Odol the absolute assurance that their
mouths are permanently protected against the
processes of fermentation and decomposition
which, if not guarded against, inevitably
destroy the teeth.
Arnold Bennett, who wrote “Milestones” in colla-
boration with Edward Knoblauch, was originally a
shorthand clerk in a solicitor’s office. He contributed
to Tit Bits in his leisure hours, and, winning several
prizes, was enticed to go in for journalism. While he
was assistant-editor of a feminine weekly, Woman, he
turned out several novels of prodigious length. But
he will not do it again. He has discovered that plays
which run to only 30 printed pages pay a million
per cent, better.
“Haresfoot”: The “Prize Drama” business makes
me think of an anecdote about Eugene Scribe and De
Musset. Scribe (to De M.) : “I cannot make out
why the public relishes your comedies more than
mine. I am celebrated most for a strict adherence
to the rules of the dramatist, whereas you defy
them.” De Musset: “The public like me because I
write to please myself, whereas you write to please
them.” The aspiring playwright has the public too
much in his eye. “Look into thy heart and write,”
says Emerson. The worst drawback to Pinero is his
knowledge of the stage. He would have gone higher
without it. He is only a Sardou—not so good, in
my opinion—when he might have been a Sheridan
Knowles. I coolly say Shakspeare did not write for
the stage. His plays were nearly all twice too long
for the Globe Theatre, where the performances lasted
only two hours, as he says in a prologue.
Ihe old-established “first part” of vaudeville dies
hard. Upon Melb. Opera House presenting
a few good artists in distinct turns, the
Gaiety followed along the same lines; but
“Billo” and his “tom” have found the change
little to their liking. So the old order again
reigneth. Lee and Rial were the first to break
away in Melbourne, some 10 years ago, at the Bijou,
and Harry Rickards followed suit. But as soon as
the rival show moved on, ’Arry went back to his be-
loved “first part.” He had a good nose for his pub-
lic s requirements.
“10-2-4”: She was a small, flat-chested woman,
with a reddish nose and the sort of false teeth which
sway with every wind that blows. She sat near me,
watching Apollo Barnstorm in “The Beauty Actor.”
“Is he not divine?” she murmured, turning a watery
brace of eyes upon her companion, a sympathiser of
her own sex and species. “Do you know that, though we
have never even met, and though my family has
always been perfectly respectable, yet. a couple of
years ago, had it not been for Emmanuel’s unvarying
kindness to me and the children” (dramatic pause)
“I should have given myself to that man,”
Shakspeare’s alleged “Troilus and Cressida” has
been given a few performances in London by the
Elizabethan Stage Society. It is poor stuff, though,
and seems to have been revived only once before in
its 300 years of existence.
From London: G. R. Sims has again provided the
book of the Drury Lane pantomime—“ The Sleeping
Beauty. Sims has now had 50 years’ experience
of play-going and play-writing, and “has seen a whole
mountain-range of theatrical ups and downs. He
remembers the manager of a AVest End house who,
m rejecting a play, mentioned that he had read the
snycopsis.’ The last time Sims saw that manager
he was wheeling a barrow into the Bethnal Green
market. Another manager whom Sims knew very
well began life as a restaurant waiter. After being
for many years prosperous, with a town and a coun-
try residence, etc., he sank back to his original
position, and when Sims last met him he was a
waiter on board a penny steamer on the Thames.
“Lud”: G. W. Smalley, friend of both, took Sarah
Bernhardt to see Irving in “The Bells,” at the
Lyceum, in London. After the show the three supped
together in the Beefsteak Club Room. Sarah: “What
is that painting on the wall?” Irving: “Kean, as
Sir Giles Overreach, in his great situation, touching
the electric chain with which we’re darkly bound, as
Byron says.” Sarah: “You touched it in my soul to-
night. Your Mathias is infinitely more powerful than
Coquelin’s, though not so true to Nature.” Irving:
“I know it. A man could never have lived at such
a tension for a course of years. No, not for a month.
Mathias is a thing forced on me by the public. I
want them to judge me by Hamlet.” Sarah: “Thus
I feel with regard ta Fedora, Theodora and La Tosca.
Judge me by Phedre. Do you know I’m studying
Hamlet, now you have cast it off?” Irving: “No,
no; the young Lord Hamlet cast me off.” Sarah:
“I will never consider myself too old for Hamlet.
Look at Moliere’s Mdlle. de Brie. ‘No,’ said the
public, ‘you shall not even give up the ingenue at
60.’ She wanted to play old women, but the people
said, ‘What are you doing—Child?’ ”
Negro minstrelsy was to be revived on a colossal
scale at the London Palladium- on Boxing Day, with
a troop of no less than 100 performers—singers,
dancers, comedians, coons, banjoists, etc., recruited
from the United States and the old-time Mohawks
and Moore and Burgess burnt-cork combinations. The
music-hall killed negro minstrelsy. After the
variety and vivacity of the halls, the semi-circle of
solemn-looking black-faced gents singing a lot of
sentimental and a few comic songs, varied by mild
conundrums from the cornermen, was voted dull, and
not worth the bob. But a new public has grown up
since the old show went under, so it may have a
successful resurrection for a time.
Bernard Shaw’s latest idea is that Birmingham
ought to be disfranchised, not because it is Joe
Chamberlain’s pocket borough, but because reallv
good high-class plays—his own, for instance —
fail there. Managers lose in Birmingham the money
they make in Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and
Dublin. Even Forbes Robertson, whom Shaw calls
the “greatest living British actor and our only
classical one,” was unable to rouse the screw-place
from its deplorable apathy. “And Birmingham,”
exclaims Shaw, “is not ashamed of itself; it cannot
blush ; it does not even apologise ; it is brazen in its
Philistinism.” Apropos, there is now going on in
that metropolis of the English midlands an official
inquiry into the conditions under which hooks, but-
tons, needles, etc., are made. The sec. of the Bir-
mingham Trades Council declared in his evidence
that “the way in which these industries are being'
carried on is a disgrace to the city and all con-
cerned. Thousands of women and girls are paid
only a penny an hour.” How many plays could
Shaw see on that wage?
“J.F.H.”: Daring chaps, these French dramatists,
gaily tackling subjects which the English playwright
would not touch with a fork. There has just been
produced in Paris the most blushful play of the year.
It is entitled “The Good Old Custom.” What cus-
tom is that? Why, as a Parisian dramatic critic
put it, the “right of the lord of the manor in the
Middle Ages to provide his tenant’s bride with late
supper and early breakfast on the wedding day and
the day fitter.” “The Good Old Custom” will never
be staged in England or Australia. The bride was
played by one of the handsomest of French actresses,
Arlette Dorgere. And her disrobing scene !
From Paris: The Th&fitre des Varieties is putting
on “The Green Coat.” It offended the Minister for
the Argentine, with the result that Australia has to
suffer. One of the characters—a fiddler —says: “I
have been offered 100,000 francs to go to the Argen-
tine for two months and give concerts ; but I’m not
going to - risk my life among the niggers.” The
Argentine Minister protested to the French Foreign
Office against this insult to his country. The theatre
people got an ultimatum, and the play was sub-
edited —by altering “Argentine” to “Australia.” So
far George Reid has not threatened war or anything.
Brander Matthews, who has put in a good many
years as critic and story-writer, with an occasional
try at plays, and is also a Prof, of Literature, tips
that “the American drama is imnroving, and the
drama in general reviving, because the author is now
certain of his pay.” He thinks that for this reason
and others the great day of the novel is passed. It
is now in closer competition with the play, and the
latter to-day pays as well, if not better, than the
novel. Drama is the only one of the arts which de-
pends on the crowd. It cannot depend on a clique.
This is right enough, but while a clique cannot log-
roll a drama to success as easily as a novel, it can,
if opposed to a play, sometimes prevent its reaching
the stage and the crowd.
The aspiring youth wanted employment in a
theatre, and wrote to the manager: ‘‘You will see
from the enclosed newspaper extract that I have con-
siderable aptitude for the stage.” This was the
extract: “The prisoner conducted himself in a
highly theatrical manner.” The manager regretted,
as usual, that there was no vacancy.

sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.

D. Parnell: You “know the Northern
Territory and this trying- to . settle the people on the
land there is hopeless, for the country and climate
are no good.” Also Gov. Phillip knew 'Sydney and
district, and it was no good. And the first settlers
in Victoria knew that part, and it was no good. And
the Romans knew Britain, and it was no good. . . .
Clifford :It doesn’t : seem very exciting in type. And,
by the way, you commit the unpardonable sin of
jambing the typed lines so close together that even
a microbe would get crushed to death if he started to
crawl through.. .Mac: Glad to hear from you, though
one item is scarcely worth while and the other is a
bit frayed through excessive use... .Flint: Needed a
stronger hand to make it a success. . .The Bohemian:
He was appointed for five years. .. . A.A.D.: Poem

And you’ve gone all the way to New Hebrides to say
those stodgy old things, while we here are aching to
know some of the things that only a man can tell
who lives at Malekula or thereabouts!.... G.H.W.:
Paean in praise of the drover’s life received in a state
of collapse. Guess the final effort to make rhymes
out of “minds” and “shines” and “wretches” and
“benches” was too much for it. ... Cambs: It’s 102°
in the shade, and we don’t know what, the faintly-
pencilled poem is all about. ... David L-C: (1) Yes.
(2) Bulletin office will find him... .W.H.M.P.: Re-

N. Quad: The country newspaper proprietor often is,
as you say, a heartless sweater ; and we’ve got our
own opinion also of the man who writes about him
in faint pencil on crumpled paper Xox: Too
wordy. We want the marrow. You could have put
all the education facts into one-fifth of the space. . .

Bellerive: A bush tragedy this week: —
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.
Frowning clouds gathered,
A storm raged around,
Huge trees were uprooted
And hurled to the ground,
When a poor woodcarter
With his horse and Dray
Was struck by Lightning
On his lonely wav.
A fond wife and children
Did anxiously await
For their loved ones who
Met an appalling fate,
An electric flash of lightning
The poor carter did kill
A stone’s throw from his home
At the foot of the hill.
.. . .1.M.: “Age 14 years.” That disarms us 1.0,:
No business to report. . . .Ava: Too wild and raw. . . .
E.L. : We would rather encourage the Devil....
G.G. (Q.) : An honest effort, which we rejected with
the greatest respect. ... .H.G.: Your poem, or whatever
it was, hit the basket at the first shot. You can send
along the story if you like, but we feel pretty hope-
less about it. . . .R.R.R.: The next contributor who
sends along the story of a tragic happening which
turns odt to be a biograph fake will be bloodhounded.
It was a cheap device even when it was new
T.8.R.: Both fail.... Ava: Plague is just sawed-off
prose. ...R.R,: “Lament” duly considered and d —d.
Are you deliberately trying to drive us to drink, or is
it just an accidental sort of torment ?... .J. A. C.:
AVould have made rather a hit about 1852 when
people had more time... .N.N.: The poem has been
carried out by the undertow, and we’ll trouble you
not to call the attention of the life-saver on duty. . . .
E. T. Simpson: Come down to details, and snecify
the pictures. ~ .Junee: The wheeled vehicle which is
passing the other should be pulled to the right....
Tarago: No, it isn’t. It’s death adder.... E.H.: It
is a strong yarn, arid we shall have to make indepen-
dent inquiries before we can risk it.... Anon: The
undertow got it. But it was clumsy work, and there
is no call to build a monument over the basket, where
it will rest till the Cleaner comes to gather the
blighted harvest. .. .H.J.E.: “Stinky” is no value;
neither is alleged joke sent for Norman Lindsay. His
ferocity would get the better of him if we banded it
to him. There is one good gag in another paragraph
of yours, but it appeared in The Bulletin a little
more than a month ago. See Exodus xx, 15.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
Rooster: The second has crowed through all the
ages; wherefore a suspicion arises that the first may
not be quite a chicken either. .. .M.P.: As a drawing
it is hopeless, and as a jest it is not hilarious. . . .
C.K.P.: Ditto, with more emphasis, the jest in this
case having moss in its whiskers. . . .Len Rees: You
might be able to do something in time. The sample
you send is, however, mere scratching—there is no
vigor or character in it... .S.T.: We’ve had that jest
already.
“Emdee” on the sacred “introduction” :
Every now and then some well-meaning cleric or
pedagogue sails in with a full cargo of scandalised
remarks about the youthful Australian’s infamous
habit of making street acquaintances. Far be it
from me to defend the dashing Knut or Pirate who
forces himself on unwilling females as a matter of
sport—this, I take it, being his economical substitute
for big-game shooting, hunting and such-like risky
diversions, dear to those who can afford them. But
I say most strenuously that there is nothing inher-
ently wrong or immoral or even undesirable in the
unconventionally formed friendship. What magic is
there in the “introduction” which is insisted on so
fiercely in middle-class circles ? None! The rela-
tions between people of opposite sexes are settled, in
every case, by the inclinations, plus the moral, social
and religious principles of the parties concerned. The
acquaintanceshin that is begun casually in a tram,
ferryboat or what not is as likely as any other to
lead to marriage—the only honest profession that is
open to fully 75 per cent, of women outside what
we call the laboring classes. A well-known city
clergyman once told me that, in a goodly proportion
of happy marriages, in his own experience, the couples
had originally met in ways that would have given the
genuine blue-nosed Wowser the cold spasms to see.
There is something senseless, not to say cruel, about
the absurd convention which restricts marriageable
women to the society of their own little set. The
effect of it is to lessen their chances of securing a
husband by about two-thirds. Last month, according
to the current London papers, a girl hanged herself.
Before doing so she opened her Bible and marked
the words of Psalm cii., 11: “My days are like a
shadow that declineth ; and lam withered like grass.”
How many are there -who do not number amongst
their friends depressing maidens who answer eloquently
to this description ? Thev have no hone, situated as
they are, of fulfilling their - natural destiny, and they
have come to realise it. Given a larger sphere, they
might find eligible youths in a similar plight to
themselves. In England, the home of social conven-
tionality, desperate attempts have been made to
solve this problem by means of marriage agencies,
agony-column advts., and other devices. They have
not proved successful, partly because such things
lend themselves naturally to the machinations of the
swindler and the adventurer, and partly because most
folks are unwilling to approach Romance through
such severely business-like channels. The best solu-
tion of an absurdly artificial system, that has had a
pernicious effect on the community in scores of ways,
is that which the ultra-moralists so furiously de-
nounce—l mean the practice of young men and
women who like the look of one another striking up
an acquaintance off-hand. It need go no further than
the girl wishes, and under favorable circumstances it
may lead her to the church door and a life of honor-
able usefulness.

George Howstout Reid struck the right
setting for the usual jokes about his fat-
ness when he waddled recently through the
Chicago canneries. What would happen to
the Sly Commissioner if he suddenly became
thin and his balloon waistcoat hung about
him in folds? Would he retire from public
life until he reconstructed his jokes, or
would he go on cheekily making capital out
of his departed figure, as years ago he made
capital out of the departed fatness of Free-
trade? A flat, wheezy Reid trying to per-
suade the world that he still went four laps
to the mile, and that the old gags fitted him
as well as ever, would be one of the confi-
dence tricks of history.
“Chasuble” on the sweated toilers in the
Vineyard :
The trouble with Archbishop Clarke, who goes to
England again—the second time within five years or
so-—is that three of his family are settled in “the
dear Homeland.” and there are three grandchildren
he has not seen, which, of course, is an intolerable
hardship. Archdeacon Hindley takes the reins as
administrator. Hindley is a sort of buzzing bumble
bee, a human hurdy-gurdy, with unadorned horse-
sense in the pulpit; but he is the real motor of the
diocese. It was he who invented the three dioceses
of Bendigo, Wangaratta and Gippsland, chopped off
from Melbourne in Goe’s time. First he nervously
proposed Bendigo, and seemed on the very point of
being thrown out by the Synod ; whereupon he took
the holy men’s breath away with, “Not only that,
but two more.” The sheer audacity of it won. On
the best of authority I hear that this humble Arch-
deacon has refused six bishoprics and a trifle of two
deaneries. As an effective man, he is on a par with
the best bish. Melbourne ever had—that’s to say,
Perry, the first one. Meanwhile, there are current
doubts as to whether Clarke will stick to this diocese,
and he may be gone prospecting. He is an eminently
presentable man, fine, upstanding, like Sydney’s Bar-
ker. Asquith will be tempted to pop him in for orie
of the numerous four-thousand-a-year billets,, even as
Salisbury popped Moorhouse into Manchester. The
Melbourne screw is £2OOO ; but they don’t expect to
get the next one under £3OOO, the price of groceries
having gone up so.
. Bigjohn Forrest, who is alleged to have
just lost the leadership of the Liberal party
in the Commonwealth by one vote, had a
brother named Dave. Dave had weight, but
no oratory. Still, for the sake of the family
name, he thought he ought to run for the
mayoralty of his suburb. For some time
prior to nominating, Dave had engaged the
council in a duel concerning some Moreton
Bay fig trees which grew on his property
and shed their rubbish on the footpath. For
his campaign he roped in a pressman friend
to write an opening address. On the ap-
pointed night he appeared on the platform
with the document, and proceeded to read it,
tracing the lines with his finger as he read.
Just as he was warming up, some cantanker-
ous person yelled out, “What about the More-
ton Bay fig trees, Dave?” For a few
moments Dave struggled for a crushing plat-
form retort. Not getting it, he let himself
go in his own way. Shaking a large fist, he
shouted : “None of that sort of shenan-
ackin here, young feller.” When the uproar
had subsided, Dave realised that he had irre-
vocably lost his place, and sat down.
Lola Montez, the vivacious dancer who
toured Australia in the ’so’s, turns up again
in a book published in London under the
title of “Love Affairs of the Courts of
Europe.” Lola bewitched King Louis of
Bavaria, who made her first favorite in his
harem and created her a Countess. She prac-
tically ruled Bavaria for a year or two.
Then came a revolution, and she had to flee
to Switzerland, dressed or disguised as a
young man. After that she resumed her old
career as actress and dancer, and shook up
the goldfields of Victoria. This new book
says there has always been a mystery about
the lady’s parentage, and mentions a theory
that she was the daughter of Lord Byron
and a charwoman. Maybe. She certainly
might have been a chip off the old block.
Concerning Rothschild, the flea-collector,
the hero of recent Bulletin verse :
Rothschild, the flea-man, is brother of the Roths-
child who is the bird-and-bug man. To do them
justice, they both intend to give their collections to
the British nation. The bird-and-bug (-and-butter-
fly) collection is, of course, by far the more im-
portant of the two. It is contained in a private
museum, and includes scores of new species. The
only thing that troubles these men is that the British
Museum won’t accept such collections as collections,
the items must be dispersed into their proper classes,
A few years ago a yarn went round the papers that
the Flea Rothschild had paid a fabulous sum, —
£l°oo or so—for a Polar-bear flea. I asked about
that flea, and mentioned the story. He laughed. “I
can sell quite a lot for half-a-crown apiece,” he said.
In fact, you can have a few for a shilling.” The
flea-hunting is really a side-line with the bird and
beast hunters. Practically every animal and bird,
if it has a flea at all. has its own flea. The Roths-
childs chief collector was asked how they
pursued the flea. A policeman happened to
be passing at the moment. “Well,” said he “sup-
posing I was wanting a policeman-flea. The right
w » v tO , ?? about it would be to kill the policeman,
and put the body into a white calico bag. When the
policeman was dead and cold the fleas would quit the
body and take refuge in.the seams of the white bag.
You could then easilv muster them into a phial”
produced. The flea-king talces six of a kind and
pays 6d. a piece. It doesn’t sound much; neither do
the prices paid for rare birds—such as new birds of
paradise. Of course, these millionaire collectors occa-
sionally commission a man to find them some special
thing—-the' male, perhaps, of a species of which thev
have the female—-and that may run to a thousand
pounds. But mostly even thm’r greatest treasure hasn’t
cost more than a few shillings. The trouble is that
they have to take dozens and dozens of duplicates that
they don t want.
Dead in England, at 78. Tom Pickernell,
a famous amateur steeplechaser. A school-
fellow and friend of Adam Lindsav Gordon
he too came over here in the ’so’s, and spent
several years in Tasmania. He was back
m England by 1859, when he had his first
mount in the Grand National at Liverpool.
He rode in 17 altogether, and won three;
finished third in his last one, when aged 41
His racing name was “Mr. Thomas.”
The Argus, discussing the election of tlm
lory leader, said that “John Forrest had
the whole, of the Westralian representatives
behind him.” The “whole” consists of
Hedges and Fowler, and threatens to be le«s
after next elections. It is believed that in
May Labor will capture both of those mem-
bers seats; and Bunhnrv will also fall to
the party as soon as Bigjohn goes.

The Aromatic Flavor.
THERE is no other brandy pro-
curable at or near the price of
MARTELL’S which embodies
so many excellent virtues.
It is magnificently potent a 3 a
medicinal spirit, being rich in the
higher ethers — and as a liqueur it is
quite unsurpassed.
Keep a bottle of MARTELL'S
in the house at all times. You will
then be sure of having a thoroughly
pure and life-giving spirit handy in
case of illness or emergency.

BRISBANE.
IN
BANANA LAND
When 70 p.c. of a recent Westralian loan
had to be taken up by the underwriters, Bris-
bane Tory papers clamored exultantly about
the financial failure of a Labor Government.
The other day, 80 p.c. of Digby Denham’s
latest flotation had also to be taken up by
the underwriters —and the same old journals
bellowed themselves hoarse about the “mag-
nificent success” of the Liberal Treasurer.
A sense of humor is a fine thing.
UNNECESSARY APOLOGY.
CHOLLY: “ Oh, pway forgive me, pway weally
do, for walking on your feet.”
OLD G ENTLEMAN: “ Don’t mention it, don’t
mention it. I often walk on them my self!”
Rockhampton’s new Bishop, Dr. Sheil, will
arrive from Dublin towards the end of
March. Instead of wearing the episcopal
millinery, he nearly achieved a halo; for
some months a trying typhoid illness baffled
Dublin’s best medical skill. But he is better
now. The new prelate is Gft. 2in. in height,
list, in weight, 38 years of age, an all-
round athlete, and owns, according to all
accounts, a striking personality.
“For illegitimate babies a bonus of £5.
b or holy virginity there is nothing but taxa-
tion. Wild shriek of an infuriated Bris-
bane Teachers' Conference lady, who had
f or gotten that virtue is its own reward.
Queensland country hospitals refuse to
admit cases of venereal disease, with the re-
sult that sufferers betake themselves to the
Brisbane “General,” which interposes no such
barrier. In more than one Queensland town-
ship the fact that a man is off color and
taking a run to Brisbane is coming to have
quite a significance.
The greatest compliment ever paid the
prickly pear came from J)r. Jean White, who
is experimenting on the spiny curse at
Dulacca. This lady expert alleges that if
you apply poisonous compounds to the out 1
side of the pear, the wily weed promptly re-
sponds by thickening his skin to rhinoceros-
hide proportions. If, on the other hand, you
pierce the pear and inject a vitus, he (or
she) immediately ‘‘sets up a combination of
protoplasm with the poison, forming a com-
pound innocuous to the plant.” F’or such
resourcefulness and its fine faculty for” meet-
ing emergencies, the blackguard almost com-
pels this paper’s admiration.
P. F. Rowland, M.A., headmaster of the
Townsville Grammar School, strdck out a
new line in his annual “report.” He didn’t
worry much about the great things Thorn-
kins minor had done in the mental arith-
metic class; he rather laid himself out to
help slay the nasty notion that the North
is no place for the white man. Incident-
ally he remarked that the white man has
been steadily moving towards sunlight and
warmth, until now Norway and Sweden are
left half populated, and the Scot is thriving
best, not in his own bleak land, but in places
where the sweat-drops stand out among his
freckles.
“Speargrass,” on the vegetable curse: —
“Don Q.” (B. 9/1/’ 13), talking of the prickly-pear
pest in Gayndah and district, says -there are avenues
of pear 20ft. and more high, tor 20 or 30
miles. This is a terminological inexactitude. There
is, I believe, one bunch of pear ,25ft. high in the
Woodmillar scrub, near Gayndah/ which is looked
on as a curiosity. Of course, I don’t wish to convey
the impression that there is no pear in Gavn-
dah and district. There ig quite a fair bit
of it, but there are no avenues, and the
ordinary growth would be'more like 4ft. Local
bodies have not got Mount; Morgan to draw on ; and
considering the means at their disposal and the
enormous area that comes under their jurisdiction,
they don’t do so badly. Also, the owner of a prickly-
pear selection, besides clearing pear, has his living to
get; and he has to toil good and hard to get it.
“Don Q,” talks of drastic laws and fines. It re-
minds. one of Alice ip Wonderland—“off with his
head.” A good bonus would be more conducive to
pear eradication than any amount of fines. You don’t
want to drive men off these lands. It’s hard enough
to get anyone on them as it is.
On a sly-grog selling change the Brisbane
magistrates let Ah Bung, of China, off the
other day with a fine of 7s. Gd. and costs. His
accomplice in sin was Show Pan. The pro-
secution produced two bottles of liquor with
labels attached, and on these latter being
translated by the court interpreter, it was
found that the grog had been placarded by
the tricky heathen as a cure for rheumatism,
painful bones, swollen muscles, diseased feet,
codghs and headache ; and taken inwardly it
was alleged to be at all times beneficial. The
Court couldn’t quite make up its mind
whether Bung and Pan really did offer the
as a. medicine, or whether they were
merely pulling the Caucasian leg; so it com-
promised on the fine mentioned above.
“Flinderino”: Port Alma, the new port
for Rockhampton, consists of four houses and
one street. The street is constructed of nar-
row planks, set on wooden blocks, with a
handrail on one side and unfathomable mud
on the other. The dwellings are on high
piles, and even then the Pacific Gcean licks
the doorsteps at high tide. At low water
there, is sometimes a few square feet of un-
certain ground to each residence. When
there are no boats in the port the inhabitants
amuse themselves by fishing out of the bed-
room windows, and spearing crabs from the
verandahs. The only domestic quadrupeds
are a couple of shell-fish eating cats and half
a dozen semi-marine goats. The local mos-
quito, so the inhabitants claim, is the largest
and hungriest outside Hades. The residents
catch them in spring traps.
Some people learned a useful lesson in a
Brisbane court the other day. The plain-
tiff claimed that lie had been struck or biffed
so that he suffered acute anguish of mind
and body, and was damnably prejudiced,
morally, physically and mentally, and so
forth. The alleged smiter produced, in his
defence, a collection of witnesses who swore.
privatim et seriatim, that an unknown had
done the deed, and then “vanished like a
shadow.” The sole flaw in their joint and
several yarn was its uncanny flawlessness.
Each of them used the same phraseology,
the same similes, the same everything. After
listening to the exhibition of unanimity, the
P.M. remarked: “It was not necessary
to waste the time of the Court any longer.
Five pounds or a month.” It was a good de-
cision. Notoriously, no two human beings
see any given happening in exactly the same
light—a thing that private detectives, law-
yers and other earnest suborners of perjury
need to bear constantly in mind if they
aspire to be a success at their professions.
Nearer Every Day.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
China and Japan are two days nearer to Brisbane
under the new schedule of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha.
Yokohama to Brisbane formerly took 30 days; now
it will only take 28. Nagasaki to Thursday Island will
only be a matter of 17 days. —News item.
E was just 5000 years be’ind the age.
And we laughed to think ’e’d ever catch
it up ;
E was shut in olden fashions like a cage,
And we made him drink of shame the
bitter cup ;
’E was ’appy with his bonzes and ’is Buddh
(Wot a pity that we couldn’t leave ’im
so!),
But we battered in his gate, and we broke
’is yellow pate,
And we set ’im on the way that ’e should
go.
But listen to the tramp of the legions,
And ’ark to the thunders in the bay;
Tou may take it well or ill, it’s a mortal
bitter pill,
But the Asian’s cornin’ nearer every day.
We ’ad charted out a country for the White,
And the Yellow Man we showed the bolted

Because ’e felt it just a little sore;
And ’e keeps a cornin’ closer every hour,
And callin’ us ’is “Allies” in ’is fun,

By God, they’re cornin’ nearer ev’ry day!

And ocean was the field where We were

That ’e’d ever run a navy was a notion
We’d never for a moment come across;
But when ’e’d broken up a big Armada,
And fattened up the fishes on the Buss,
We began to ruminate, if the ’Eathen at the

Mightn’t ’ave a grim significance for us!
But —it’s list to the guns of the Mongol,
And ’ark to his cannon in the bay ;
Then sit you down and think what is wait-
ing on the brink
When Asia’s cornin’ closer ev’ry day.
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January 25, 1913.
My Dear Tjiargomindah,—
The local rep. of the Industrial Union of
Vice-Regal Stone-Masons, William Macgre-
ger. shouldered his tool-kit this morning
and left for Dalby, where he will lay a
foundation block for a new hospital. The
job finished, he and his apprentice, Foxton,
will go to Gowrie, where they will spell-oh
at the home of the hospitable Kings.
Lady Macgregor is due here in March,
with the long-lost Vision and a youthful
grand-daughter. So father’s days of “bach-
ing” are nearly over. Someone else will soon
wash the dishes, boil the spuds and scale the
fishes.
MURPHY, ALL. A., Queensland's
Independent Party.
Yesterday afternoon, at Government
House, the Excellency presented gold medal'
to four of the boys who did such plucky work
at the time of the recent Southport bathing
fatality. The medallions were the gift of
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Hobbs. Acting-Premier
Barlow, Mayor and Mayoress Raymond, and
the relatives of the boys were the only guests.
The four who stood in the limelight (Will-
cocks, Lahey, Robertson and Collins) looked
as if they would have cheerfully bartered
their medals for a desert island. Mr. and
Mrs. McNish also gave to Robertson a gold
sovereign-purse, since he it was who saved
their little daughter. Mr. T. A. Bond, who
was responsible for two rescues, and whose
reputation for daring deeds dates back to the
great flood of ’93, was among the onlookers.
Last Thursday, local Presbyterians, headed
by Governor Macgregor and twa kilties wi’
the pipes blawing, gathered to welcome Mini-
ster Cosh and his wife. The Rev. Cosh has
succeeded to the place left vacant by the
death of the Rev. Frackleton, round whom
waged such a kirk riot as will be forgotten
only when Glencoe is forgiven. There were
400 in the multitude, and they were fed on
speeches, prayers, music and other palatable
and unpalatable viands.
“Bob” Philp was Exhibit A at a river trip
on Wednesday night. The people who had
farewelled. him with a silver tea and coffee
service prior to his departure on his recent
trip, reassembled to give him the welcome-
home hand. It was a chilly evening, and a
strong breeze was blowing, so that the flap-
ping of all the female coats on board was
like unto the sound of an angel host battling
for places on the Roost of Peace. Long
stretches of speeches were unrolled in the
gale and blown to windward, and if the dole-
ful band on the hurricane deck had gone in
the same direction all would have been well.
In the circumstances, it was only #-well.
Miss Isabel Rutherford, who has been
governess to the Chelmsford children for five
years, has bought Miss Burdorff’s school
here, and will get her muscle into trim at
once.
James Edmond, editor of The Bulletin
with his wife and daughter. arrived in Bris-
bane yesterday by . the St. Albans from
Manila. They will motor to Toowoomba
next week, and return to Sydney by mail
train.
Died this week, Philip Bigge, member 0 f
a well-known pastoral family in Queens
land. He devoted himself "almost entirely
to the management of his property, which
included a half-share in Mount Brisbane sta U
lion. Eric McConnel owned the other half
1 lis death followed an operation for appen
dicitis. The widow was a Miss Hart
daughter of the late solicitor, Graham Hart’
There is only one child, a boy of 12. Mr
Bigge had just taken passages for the family
to England, and intended to settle there. J
Mrs. John Brown and her pretty and
popular daughters left Brisbane for "keeps
on Sunday last, by the Kyarra. At Sydney
they tranship for London, where the head of
the family has been settled for some months
as manager of Thomas Brown and Sons’
London house. It will be a long time be-
fore the social chasm caused by their depar-
ture can be filled in.
Another outward-bound is Mrs. W. S.
Byrne, who is known to all the younger set
as “Auntie.” She will be greatly missed,
too. Her intention is to visit Ireland
(where she has a group of aboriginal
cousins) and England. The Willcoeks family
departed with her. After a year’s travel
they will leave Hazel, the strikingly hand-
some youngest daughter, at school in Swit-
zerland.
Bacteriologist Found this week returned
from the United States, where he has been
gleaning knowledge of the family life of the
tick, its habits, vices, political opinions, and
weakest point of assault. Local tick stocks,
however, are still firm.
Schoolmaster Wheatley, late of the Rock-
hampton Grammar School, is doing research
work at Oxford.
A Melbourne artist, Miss Dods, is visiting
Cairns, in order to gain a first-hand know-
ledge of the warm coloring of the scenery.
It glows there in profusion.
Mr. and Mrs. Bob McNab and the latter’s
sister. Miss Tully. are on the projected de-
partures list for Japan, where the Antarctic
exploration parties come from —I don’t
think.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Queensland State school teachers are a
strenuous lot. Quite a number of them
sacrificed their holidays, or a good part of
them, to go into camp at Southport and
learn military drill. Then came a confer-
ence, in which many of the military men
participated. After that, a number of lesser
mostly-educational conventions, well-attended.
All of which proves, over again, how a sub-
tropical climate saps the vigor, physical and
mental, of Northerners.
From the North :
Lacaze, a Herbert River cane-grower, has invented
his own rain supply. On his three farms (total 600
acres) he has put down six stations, with six 2in.
spears on each farm. Each spear is down 22ft., and
each contains from 16ft. to 17ft. of water. A 4in.
centrifugal pump, capable of raising 20,000 gallons
an hour, driven by a 12-h.p. oil engine, is mounted
on a waggon, and is drawn from station to station.
Spraying, to imitate rain, is obtained by a pipe
system. It is claimed that this spraying is far better
than flooding. At a demonstration, young cane which
had not hitherto been watered, opened its leaves im-
mediately the spray got to work ; and on a field
which had a fortnight-old wetting there was a growth
of a foot. The Herbert begins to think it knows
now how to make a permanent success of sugar-
growing.
The Bulletin doesn’t know whether any-
body has guaranteed that there will always
be water in the shallow bore-holes.
“Kuscobin,” on a piece of statecraft: —
When Kidston was Premier of Queensland, and, in-
c'dentallv member for Rockhampton, he left his
electorate a legacy that ought to earn him its grati-
tude for all time, in the shape of the Port Alma to
Rockhampton railway. By agreement with the Brit-
ish India Co., the Government charges ss. per ton
for loading on this track, a distance of 37 miles.
The rate applies all round, whether the goods carried
be gelignite or chaff. This works out at under lfd.
per ton per mile. The average rate from (say) Brisbane
to Ipswich works out at just a fraction under 6d. per
mile per ton. It costs the collieries at Ipswich 106 s.
6d. per ton to bring lip anything under four-ton lots
of gelignite from Brisbane, or just under Is. per ton
per mile, whilst Rockhampton mines have to pay only
ljd. The Port Alma line, of course, is making a dead
loss that has to be levelled up by overcharges on
other lines; yet the Department can’t mend matters
because of the agreement with the 8.1.5. N. Co. It
is a fine tribute to Wullie’s statesmanship—or what-
ever you like to call it.
A Cairns police court was the scene re-
cently of a sensational drama. A Chow,
accused of wilful murder, attracted attention
by his peculiar appearance. Medical exami-
nation showed him to be a leper—one of the
dozens that are supposed to be roaming N.Q.,
or, too sick to roam, are waiting for death in
a hovel on a banana plantation. Without
wishing its friends any ill, The Bulletin
would dearly love to have the choosing of the
Court to try the alleged murderer. It would
assign Bruce Smith for his defence, and ask
that the leprous accused, being a stranger in a
strange land, might be permitted to take a
seat at the Bar table. A score of the fattest
gentleman who say that the country can’t be
developed with white labor should be enrolled
as court criers, jurors and sweepers. Then
it would rope in another 20 of the advocates
of a piebald Australia, and make them toss
for the privilege of being Ah Pong’s hang-
man or perpetual gaoler, as the case may be.

ONE of the best proofs of R-C-H
value is the number of buyers
who heretofore have been
driving cars costing from to
And there’s a good reason for it. You
get in the R-C-H the utmost in comfort,
in looks and in strength. You get power
sufficient to take you and your family
wherever you want to go, and faster
than you’ll ever want to drive. You get
an economy of operation impossible in

save from £lOO to £2OO.
The easiest way to prove these things

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hoar of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. W hat a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when .the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers 'restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot h” r t the ear;
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the W T ilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve co m-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
fV
0
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and alsp an
inserter. After the first' pair is bought you may' pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get ,at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can. '

WATEP BLISTERS
On Body. Could Not Sleep Night or
Day, Scratched Herself to Pieces.
Nothing Cured Until Tried Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment.
5 Vincent St., Balmain, Sydney, N. S. W.
—“ I had a young baby left in my care
about two years ago, and the child caught
a very severe form of skin disease. The
skin disease first appeared on her body j ust
like little water blisters under the skin, and
it used to irritate the child that much that
she could not sleep night or day, and she
used to scratch herself to pieces. Even in
her sleep, she would scratch.
“Then I saw one of the Cuticura adver-
tisements and I at once sent for a sample
and applied it. I found that it seemed to
cool the affected parts at once so I procured
a pot of Cuticura Ointment and a cake of
Cuticura Soap. She had always been in
such a burning heat, and the nasty sores
that used to come after it, and it used to
swell so, and through scratching herself she
got it under her finger nails, in fact, her
fingers and thumb were so bad that I
thought she would lose the first joint. The
whole of her body and even her head was
affected. It is six months since I left off
using the Cuticura Remedies, and she hasn’t
had a sign of the trouble since. Nothing
seemed to ease or cure it till I tried the
Cuticura Soap and Ointment.” (Signed)
Mrs. Ethel Christian, May 16, 1911.

hands with itching, burning palms, a one-
night Cuticura treatment works wonders.

The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hair-Growing Compound
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know lull well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair C^nver.
1 am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. Aly hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. 1
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of niv true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others—but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

Stony : After the New Year goose was dead and
digested, one of Melbourne’s largest poultry-providing
firms disclosed some fowl facts to a daily 'paper. Of
the allegations, the most startling was that an em-
ployee had earned 275. in one day during the festive
season, dressing Christmas dinners. In one work-
ing day (number of hours not specified) this expert
did 80 birds, which works out at about 4d. per fowl.
Since it seemed to be a simple matter, and we had
a fowl or two fit for killing, I decided to take 10
minutes off yesterday and prepare one for the table.
Beginning at 9 a.m., I removed the rooster’s head
and let the bird hang for a while. I then proceeded
to take 20 minutes more off and rough-pluck the
corpse. At 9.30, I took another half-hour off and
began systematically to remove the smaller feathers.
By 9.45, there being then only a fine sub-stratum
of feathers left, I plucked the thing all over once
again. At 10.15, having singed off the bird’s hair
(fowls have hair, though not enough to keep them
from looking somewhat bald when their feathers are
removed), I set out to truss it, following printed
directions. Removing the neck at the shoulders, I
sat the biped up on its haunches (see instructions)
and endeavored to remove the crop, “which is easily
done.’’ Only a part of the crop parted willingly
from its parent fowl. The rest got lost, and took
until 10.30 to discover. By 10.40 I had drawn the
bird, all except the gizzard, which resolutely refused
to be drawn for some time. At 11.15, working at
high pressure, I had the rooster bested, and handed
it in at the kitchen door, feeling that 4d. was
microscopic money for the job. In reporting the
earning of 275. by one man, the newspaper which
printed the glad news remarked that poultry-dress-
ers were scarce. I expect it’s the apprenticeship
that chokes ’em off.
* * * *
“Green Lamp”: The indignant chemist hailed from
Maoriland, where good fish is cheap enough to be
regarded as everyday food. He told me he had that
evening paid a Greek patriot to supply him with a
meal of schnapper, but had been given instead a
dish of octopus, or shark, or some other carrion
thinly disguised in sauce. While he was fuming
over the swindle, he propped his paper against the
dirty cruet and read a triumphant report of the
prosecution of a Sydney chemist for selling olive oil
or something which was slightly below standard. The
pill merchant had not substituted train oil or lard
for the superior product, but had passed on a pro-
duct that was a decimal point or so below the
official odds. The swindled visitor desired earnestly
to know why the Health people passed bv the out-
rageous fish-pirate and leaped on his profession. 1
was unable to tell him. Seems to me that the fish
and oyster freebooter should, so to speak, dwell per-
manently under the cold eye of the Health Depart-
ment. His tragically dilapidated dustbox and the
ruinous smell that hangs like a curse over his fishy
den call for eternal suspicion and supervision. No-
thing but a shark could live in such an atmosphere.
* * * *
“R. 8.”: Pure Foods Acts have insisted on - the
publication of the presence of salicylates in explo-
sive tomato sauce ; the new and incomplete Life As-
surance Bill does something towards forcing the con-
fidence-trick companies to state something approach-
ing the truth of their financial position; and i”s
time the advertiser got the facts of newspaper cir-
culation. Statutory declarations of circulation for a
month are able to state quite truthfully the reverse
of the facts, by reason of the newsagents being in-
structed to keep back “returns” for that month. I
know of one paper whose circulation is increased by
nearly 50 p.c. during the time of audit by keeping
the “returns” out of the office for that period ; and
it’s a concern quite big enough to be above the
fraud. Furthermore, the quantity of financial notices
and puffs of school speech-day reports which are
paid for would amaze the public which accepts these
statements as gospel. Let the habit go to its reason-
able sequence, and by-and-bye all the genuine, un-
paid-for news in some Australian dailies will be the
stodgy leader that nobody reads, the cable about the
unspeakable Turk who wouldn’t pay for it if he
had the chance, and the last dying speech and con-
fession of the condemned who is executed before he
has been asked to pay for the notice of his per-
formance.
* * * *
Public Actuary Gouge, of S.A., presses the claim
of his State to be the thriftiest in the Common-
wealth. Issuing a belated report on Friendly Soci-
eties for the five-year period ending with 1909, he
quotes the capital per member in these societies at
nearly £l5. Victoria was then second, and has since
gone top. As for the Savings Bank, depositors num-
bered more than half the State’s population, with an
average credit of £34. Westralia was second in
that comparison.
Victoria’s insolvents numbered 392 last year as
against 289 in 1911, but their total deficiencies were
only £40,062 in ’l2, as against £51,035 the year
before. Of the 392, only 84 were in Melbourne; so
the country trader and manufacturer “goes bung”
about four times as numerously as his city competi-
tor. Thus Ballarat had 40 insolvencies, Bendigo 21
Horsham 18, Warracknabeal 19, Geelong and Echuca
14 each, and Kerang 25. Melbourne’s insolvents
were some £7OOO short altogether, while Kerang’s
little lot owned up to a surplus of assets over lia-
bilities amounting to £4OO. The trouble evidently
was that the country trader couldn’t turn his assets
into cash —which mostly means that “the back-
bone” couldn’t pay its bill. Almost anybody thinks
he can run a store in the country. When he finds
that “the backbone” wants a year’s credit, and then
occasionally requires the bill renewed till after next
harvest, the storekeeper without capital begins to feel
un v. ell.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CITY PIG SALES.
City pig sales: All grades firm.”
—Nourishing news.
When I’m sick of Fancy’s flights,
Tired of gossamer delights,
Weary of fine dreams and visions—
T hings remote as star collisions—-
When my thoughts, no longer buoyed,
Fall like star-dust through the void,
Fail and fall towards red damnation,
Seeking for some firm foundation,
Helpless then I sit and squirm,
So I fight on,
Till I light on:
“City Pig Sales —All Grades Firm.”
“Porkers baconers, backfatters.”
Poets are as mad as hatters !
Who could pen a line like that,
Full of nourishment and fat ?
I prefer to wordy jigs
Droves of daily-paper pigs,
Grunting down the figured column
In a manner stout and solemn.
Dreams are hungry things. The worm
Turns from talkers
Unto porkers.
(“City Pig Sales—All Grades Firm.”)
When from eating bacon I
Rise on Fancy’s wings to fly,
Do I scorn the waddling thing
On whose fat I daily sing?
Heavens, no ! My appetite
Soon will force me to alight,
Bring me diving from mid-air
Like a plummet back to where
Good “Backfatter” serves his term.
Bards are sighing !
Bacon’s frying !
(“City Pig Sales—All Grades Firm.”)

“ Good Advice is Beyond Price,”
c.
says an old proverb, and that’s why my counsel is
worth more to you than my weight in gold.
The pure Para, from which the
RED RUBBER TUBE
is made, owes its exceptional strength and elasticity, as
well as its rich red color, to the chemical treatment to
which it —and it alone —can be subjected.
That explains its superiority, which is proved by
experience.

This target shows the highest record ever made in a 100-Shot 22 Calibre
Match. The match took place in March 1911, at the Zettler
New York, the winner being Arthur Hubalek with a score oi
out of a possible 2500. Mr. Hubalek used Remington-UML Lesmolz

REXONA.
A SYDNEY CARTER’S PRAISE.
“Some few weeks ago I had a painful experience,” writes Mr. J. R.
Williams, South Sydney Street, Mackay, Queensland. “I was employed by the
well-known Sydney grocery firm of I. Israel, Sussex Street, and when removing a
2cwt. cask of soda to the cellar it got away and smashed my left hand against
the stone steps, causing three very severe lacerations and bruising my hand all
over. The pain I suffered was intense, and for some days my hand was useless.
I could not bear to touch the injured hand, and although I did not have to relin-
quish my work, yet it was with the greatest difficulty that I performed my
duties. I fortunately was recommended to try Rexona, an ointment that I
saw advertised in the city papers, and after one application the pain commenced
to disappear and the lacerations to heal, and the bruised part to regain its nor-
mal condition. I persevered, and Rexona soon completed its rapid cure, much
to my satisfaction. I can heartily recommend Rexona to anyone who meets
with an accident of similar nature.”
Rexona, the New Rapid Healing
Ointment, is a reliable remedy for
Pimples, Blackheads, Rashes, Boils,
Cuts, Burns, Bruises, Prickly Heat,
Scabs on the Head, Scrofu=

The Rout of the Forest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the city of Sydney, 272 buildings erected,
j j n the suburbs 7717, at an expenditure of
*£s 060 000, approximately —all in the year.
—Triumphant daily paper article.
The flames were practically unfightable. Strenuous
fforts were put forward by local residents, but all to
o avail- At times it appeared as if the many pretty
'little cottages in the way would be destroyed, but
the rain saved the situation.
—Report of suburban bush fire.
r|IEN thousand years grew the forest
' ( facing the harbor so blue ;
Then came the land agent, rancid,
babbling of "ozone” and “view” ;
Transient creatures, wrapped loosely in flow-
-1 ing and dark-colored bark —
Growths that he spoke of as “buyers”—•
cackled like biids in a park;
Cackled, and prodded, and listened ; rustled
like leaves in a breeze ;
Clotted the murder and downfall of Time’s
irreplaceable trees ;
Loudly they plotted and chaffered, drove
little pegs in the ground,
While the dumb prey of the headsmen
rustled in horror around.
Jones* was the name of the fungus that
bought up this forest-land choice ;
Jones sent his steel-laden minions to murder
the things without voice ;
Bravely they sawed at the branches, bravely
they hacked at the truuks,
Till, with a cracking of sine-"'=. they tottered
like so many drunks —-
Tottered and fell ’midst Lie bracken, and lay
with their roots in the air.
Then came the drays and the woodmen ; each
of them gathered his share,
Loaded, and slowly deported, a mass of in-
animate sticks,
All to make room for the fungus and its
indispensable bricks.
Jones built a house, and a good one, where
had been “nothing but trees” ;
On the veiandah, at even, Jones loved to
lounge at his ease —
Lounge and look over the busliland where he
had “picked lots” to sell.
Jones, when he thought of his foresight, used
with importance to swell.
When he read building statistics showung the
rapid increase,
Jones felt annoyed with the forest full of
cool shadow's and peace ;
Trees did not help to pay taxes —no cash
came from busliland retreats.
Jones in his dreams saw' the busliland cut
into sun-blasted streets.
Oh! but the forest survivors, standing like
veterans at bay,
Kept all their eyes on the fungus sprawling
on brick o’er the way ;
Every zephyr that stirred them took, in the
strange forest code,
Messages re the invader, camped by his
well-guttered road ;
Every gale saw mass meetings—meetings
wdiere speeches were made,
Stringybark. Red'Gum and Blue Gum pour-
ing forth curse and tirade;
Jones, quite at ease by his fireside, w'atched
the mad rage of the trees,
Yawmed like a fool and said dully, “Yers,
that’s a pritty stiff breeze.”
Then with the march of the seasons flame-
haired young Summer came round ;
Tree locusts shrieked in the branches, hot
crickets whirred in the ground ;
Jones, very hot, took the hose out to give
the geraniums a drink,
When, in the shade of the forest, he saw a
red eye give a wink ;
Ere he could cast the hose from him there
was a rustle and roar,
And the pent rage of the giants started to
smoke and to soar.
Jones seized a branch like a duster (Jones,
though a fungus, w'as game).
Then he dashed into the battle, thrashing
the pillars of flame.
Fiercely the Summer blaze crackled, vali-
antly forward it strove;
Rut to the aid of Jonesfungus came a sub-
urbanite drove ;
Just for the sake of the cottage and building
statistics they came,
Broke off the quaint litle branches, joined in
the fire-thrashing game.
Then the skies wept for the outrage—Jones
versus Forest-on-Fire ;
Wept for the Forest Primeval, and so
quenched its dearest desire.
Which was to w'ipe out its foeman, and grow
o’er his bricks and his bones!. • • •
Sigh for the vanishing Forest! Pray tor
the conquering Jones!

III. —THE LILY OF ST. LEONARDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
J Horse Ferry—or, as the crews call
I it, the Punt —is, as I have shown in
another sketch, the morning refuge
of certain known and notorious citizens of
the suburbs of North Sydney, whose daily
work, or daily loaf, lies in the city, and who
have made consummate asses of themselves
going across home on the passenger teiry
the night before —generally at the end o
the month. As witness the case of my de-
plorable artistic acquaintance, Johnson.
Not that these citizens care much tor the
spirit of North Sydney—nor it for them,
for that matter, seeing that North Sjdney
has even less spirit than Sydney itselt (an
that’s saying a good deal) ; but they re genei-
allv sick and shaky and sorry and ashame ,
and haven’t the needful for the two drinks
that will remedy those failings, and
they’re anxious to escape the. observation o
any chance members of their audience o
the previous evening. ll]ar
There is horse nature on the vehieulai
ferrv, as well as human— only one s
always sober. When the punt bumps the
side of tin* landing they all waltz involun-
tarily, and wake up simultaneously with ex-
pressions of surprise, from mild to start ed.
1 remember one big old draught horse that
always went to sleep comfortably as ° ‘ p
he came aboard : and, when the bump came,
he always reminded me, in Ins win s,
Oranny, when she’d nodded too far o ■
knitting, and brought up with a jerk, an
thought she'd dropped her specs.
But tins is the story of the Lily of St.
Leonards; and I don’t know what the horses
have to do with it, except that, without
doubt, there was or had been a Granny in
the ease, and perhaps Lily had often perched
on her knee or sat beside her while she nodded
over her knitting or her Bible ; or even said
her prayers at her knee. Or nodded over
her gin—But, no! I prefer the knitting
and Bible and prayers. It sounds better
and it costs nothing. Besides, I used to say
my prayers when I was a child.
She w r as a slip of a girl, half Jewish, and
Jewish by name, with, dark brown eyes and
blue-black hair. She had the face as well as
the figure that the artist looks for; and she
also had brains. A rare combination in any
man’s experience. Why she was called the
Lily of St. Leonards I’ve either forgotten
or never knew. Perhaps because she was
born and lived there, and her heart and soul
and character were considered spotless in
those days. She was an artist’s model and
a Venus of Milo. At least I think that is
the name. She was known in all the studios
and a favorite there —was warmly and
uproariously welcomed at artists’ diggings
and artists’ suppers, for her wit and humor,
philosophy and laughter. She had common
sense, too. _ The most enjoyable holiday
trips, picnics; theatre-evenings and oyster
suppers I ever spent were with the Lily of
St. Leonards, and a few chosen spirits
(dead or lost or respectable now) in the
days ere Bohemia died in Sydney and was
buried with Victor Daley.
The last time I heard her laugh was at a
send-off supper given to a writer and an
artist. And, a few days later, I, John Law-
rence, went to the world away to seek the
living my own land begrudged me; and Lily
went her way rejoicing and to bring joy of
life and laughter into the hearts of others.
But there was a writer, and he was a scoun-
drel. He is doing well in two nations now,
and I hope he’ll come across this poor sketch
and read it to the end when he isn’t feeling
too good.
* * # *
A few months after my return from
foreign lands I had occasion to go across to
North Sydney. I had left all my chances in
foreign lands —no matter why. I wanted to
hunt up a member of that vanished send-off
supper party of the near, dear denarted days,
and maybe inouire after the Lily and some
of the other boys; but he had departed also.
So I came back on the vehicular ferry, be-
cause an uncle or cousin or something of
mine was then skipper of the old punt, and
I wanted to save the penny. I had five other
coins, and they represented two (2) pints of
beer.
It was getting late one day in the summer
of our year and the winter of mine, and near-
ing the time for the last horse ferry across.
There was the usual little collection of
honest and weary carters and draymen and
draught horses going home. There was also
an early taxi-cab (of its kind), with a veiled
and slouch-hatted and silent mystery inside
the shade. Perhaps it, too, wanted to avoid
the glare and stare of the passenger ferry.
Likewise there was a belated bottle-o cart;
and I recognised the driver as none other
than my old friend Benno. We greeted each
other in silence. He never asked where I
came from —Benno never wondered at any-
thing. I attached myself to Benno’s cart,
and so was at once independent of ticket col-
lectors —and of relatives, too, in a financial
way of speaking.
There had been a blue-black pall overhead,
but it had risen in a great arch over a broad
sunset, and in that light I saw a woman
standing by the bulwark, for’ard the wheel,
on the other side of the deck. She had her
back towards us, and was looking up the
Parramatta River. Over her was a long,
brownish jacket, of the style affected by the
English servant girl of 10 or 12 years ago,
or by ’Arriet of East End and London
North at an earlier date ; and her hat was of
the modified style of the Liz of our own
Billo. But neither seemed to suit her, some-
how, even though seen from the rear in the
gathering gloom. The jacket was worn and
frayed, and hung loosely on her figure. As
she sort of side-stepped quickly and de-
cisively, apd moved further up the deck and
awav. something struck me in a flash as
familiar. But it might have been a trick of
sunset lights and shadows.
“Who’s she?” I asked Benno; then added
quickly, to save a mistake, “Is she the
missus?”
“Noh!” snorted Benno (but in a whis-
pering snort), not that he held her or any
woman in particular contempt, or women in
general, but at the bare idea of his ever
marrying one of them. “My old 'tin’s good
enough for me. > But I know her,” he said,
still in a hoarse whisper. “She’s got a old
mother or grandmother or something, up
back here on the Shore, off Blue’s Point-
road. I git bottles there, sometimes. She’s
been goin’ it strong this last year or two,
that one. Just done a month on the Island
for her last drunk and disorderly, an’ I
s’pose she’s ashamed to be seen on the pas-
senget (ferry). She’s well known on the
Shore. I seen her cornin’ over on the punt
this mornin’, an’ I met her nivht before
last.” And Benno went to the little shelter
behind the wheel to light his “lamp”—a
bottle with the bottom knocked out and a
piece of pared candle dropped into the neck
of it.
I looked at the girl—or woman —again.
The breeze pressed the old .cloak, and it
clung to her figure, showing girlishly—out-
lined by a sunset that was reddening
now, and crowing glorious. And again I
was conscious of the something familiar.
That irritating, on-the-tip-of-the-tongue sort
of consciousness of a forgotten memory that
makes a man, when in company, hold up his
finger for silence, and put that finger to his
lips or wrinkle his forehead and consult
the ground, while consulting the back of his
head with the palm of his left hand.
Benno came back. Benno misses nothing
without seeming to see anything.
“You seem interested.” he said. I d call
it a mash: but I wouldn’t if I was you.
Yeh don’t know her.” .... .
Benno is very slow and deliberate with his
information, and gives it: with long pauses
between the pieces. The longer you cant
seem to wait, the more Benno can. He
fixed his bottle in its socket. „
“She used to be a hartist’s model once,
said Benno. “They call her the Lily of
Si Leonards. The boys shout it after her
when she’s shickered. Gorblime, it s a
Weedin’ shame.”

Zam-Buk Comforts
and Heals Soothes
Swelling and Aching—and Strengthens and Stimulates the Feet.
ZAM-BUK has proved a splendid cure for foot troubles. When the
feet ache or smart, and feel hot, tired and swollen, wash them in
warm water, and then rub the soles, ankles and insteps freely
with Zam-Buk. As Zam-Buk’s potent, healing' juices sink through
the skin, they soothe the tissues, strengthen the tendons, and bring
real "foot comfort.” Chafed and blistered parts are strengthened or
healed, and hard growths are softened. Zam-Buk comforts and heals
hot, swollen, sweating feet, galled spots, and takes away the pain of
corns and bunions. There is nothing so good for the feet as Zam-Buk,
the ideal soother and perfect healer.
Sore Heels and Tender Feet.
“Being an insurince traveller,” says Mr. W.
Sims, of 139 Tynte St., North Adelaide, ‘‘l am a
lot on my feet, and very often sutler from sore
heels and tender feet. Upon the application of
your Zam-Buk Healing Balm the soothing effect
is wonderful, and in a short time my heels are
quite sound again. I always have Zam-Buk in
the house for the use of my wife and children in
case of burns, scalds, etc., and have great
pleasure in recommending it to fellow-sufferers.”
Burning Feet and Sore Insteps.
Mrs. Gunson, of 157 Hoddle St., West Rich-
mond, Melbourne, writes : “ I afh a canvasser,
and am, therefore, constantly on my feet. My
insteps became very tender and broke out in
sores. I applied different lotions procured from
the chemist, but they utterly failed to (rive me
relief. Seeing Zam-Buk advertised, I procured a
pot. Before I had used half of it, the sores were
all healed, and the burning:, irritating feeling had
left my feet.”

Dead Man’s Creek.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Til HIS Dead Man’s Creek lies on the West
| Coast of Maoriland, within a fertile
rift of mountain terraces that widen
out into broad, soggy moorlands, reaching to
the sea. Every mining region has a Dead
Man’s Creek, and if this one deserves the
name better than others, it is because all the
men who won gold from its dark tunnels, and
made its tiny valley fragrant with the in-
cense of silver-pinewood, are dead as they
ever will be. They lie buried over against
the township, five miles away; and the weka
comes down the creek at night, and lilts its
wild notes among their deserted tenements ;
plum trees drop their ripe load on prostrate
paling fences; and the small, shameless-
looking pub stands with its two front win-
dows boarded up like a pair of black eyes.
Of the four derelicts of Dead Man’s Creek
only two were any longer capable of exer-
tion. One was a solemn-eyed man on the
far side of 70, who dyed his hair and beard
an unconvincing green-brown, and then hid
himself far from the admiring eye of mor-
tals, within the depths of a tunnel. With his
mate he secured in gold about the amount of
an old age pension, which might have been
had clean and dry for the asking; but they
prized their independence like the vagrant
goats that capered on steep patches of ver-
dure above the precipice of the creek. At
length they also went down into the un-
pi omising shaft which the sexton digged for
them.
Percival Creech, the third male survivor
of a glory that had been, lived in crazy isola-
tion far up the creek. He was a reputed col-
lector of empty matchboxes, with which he
had partly filled a room, and he claimed pro-
perty in the unattainable goats, though they
treated with levity any attempt on his part
to approach them. Nevertheless, he roared
asseveration of his rights, and discharged a
gun wildly when a chance visitor entered the
valley. At length he was left in peace; no
one came near but the weekly baker boy, who
left his bread at a respectful distance in a
box nailed to a post.
Female society had but one representative
—a bustling, white-haired old woman, who
plied the visitor with monstrous compliments,
and pattered round after the grumpy baker
boy for the treasure of his conversation. She
grew geraniums and tended a few fowls, until
an excess of loneliness and salt meat drove
her forth, and she started out across the
moors in the small hours of a summer morn-
ing. She might have had speech of the man
with the sooty-brown beard and his mate,
except that during the day-time they were
buried in the tunnel, and even at Dead Man’s
the conventions forbade a lonely woman to
enter the abode of a bachelor gentleman after
nightfall. There was Creech, to be sure; but
Creech was not sociable. And, besides, he
had been an enemy of her husband, the late
Sandy Mcßean. Sandy’s pig had acquired
a comfortable habit of sleeping under
Creech’s dwelling, until the owner, with the
fiendish ingenuity of the half-crazed, bored
auger-holes in the floor, and poured scalding
water on the recumbent pork. It snorted
hurriedly, and, after a swift journey home,
began to develop bald red patches, the mys-
tery whereof was not hidden from Sandy
Mcßean. So he sought an interview, which
only, ended in unprofitable bellowing and
shaking of fists —threats of the law on the
part of Sandy and threats of a gun on the
part of Creech.
Thus it came about that some railway
gangers saw a frail old woman with yellow-
white hair and a frightened look, moving
over the moor in wide, eccentric circles.
Then the mental hospital claimed her, and she
had company, if not of the best.
Last of all came the turn of Creech. The
baker boy, seeing that his bread supply ac-
cumulated in the box, ventured up for an
explanation; and when he saw Creech glar-
ing at him from a bunk, with the red light
one sees in the eyes of a dog, he stopped to
ask no questions. A policeman and an ex-
press driver came to remove Creech, and
found him speechless. Constable O’Grady
looked round the room, and seeing nothing to
take charge of, stepped into a rear apart-
ment. which he marvelled to find stored with
matchboxes, occupying corner-wise a third of
the room. He opehed several, and, finding
them empty, kicked the collection playfully
with his heavy foot. Creech listened and
squirmed as the operations of the sacrilegi-
ous feet were borne upon his consciousness,
and then he was carried out, writhing like a
captured eel. The perturbation of his spirit
and the roughness of transport were too
much for Creech, and he died soon after his
arrival at the hospital, with his face twisted
towards Dead Man’s Creek.
* * * *
In the township lived Billy Spritt, an ath-
lete and hero of football fields, with a jaw
like a money-box. That unlovely jaw be-
tokened, among other kinds of determina-
tion, the resolve not to work. For Billy was
like the bucks of certain primitive tribes that
consider hard work dishonoring to a man of
mettle, and devote the pauses between deeds
of valor to meat and drink and sleep. This
was well enough while a match or a race
could be bartered, and a parrot-nosed in-
triguer found to make it worth while. But
at last selection committees averted their
nostrils from Billy; and being desperately in
want of money he accepted a bribe to lose a
race, got his pals to “put a bit” on himself,
and then sped for the tape like a wild Indian.
After that temporary triumph he was left
idle in the market place, because no man had
hired him. So he punched his wife for being
a nuisance and an expense, and when a
Friendly Society that had lent him money
at 10 per cent, began to squeeze, he was
sold out.
It was at this point William bethought
himself of Dead Man’s Creek and its aban-
doned dwellings, and thither he migrated on
a waggonette with his wife and two bant-
lings. They took possession of Creech’s hut,
and Billy spent the afternoon panning the
bed of the creek. But the results were
meagre, the occupation cramping to a man of
action, and the sandflies that devoured his
hands and neck absorbed enough dishonest
blood to infect them for life. Then he re-
membered the days of his youth and unen-
cumbered blessedness, and disappeared.
Mrs. Spritt set about clearing out the
empty matchboxes, hurling them through a
small window in handfuls, till her head grew
dizzy and she was recalled to herself by
striking a score of loaded boxes, which on
examination were found to contain money,
biie o-ot a sugarbag and began to stuff it
feverishly with rust-stained notes and gold
and small change. At last she took the bag
and went to the door to screech for Billy, but
on second thoughts hung it up within a skirt
av • • • ' away from his Profane eye.
Waiting with a sensation that was partly
exultation and partly terror, until the night
Jiad long closed in, she burned manuka scrub
to drive out the mosquitoes, and barricaded
the door, bhe lay awake through the long
dark, listening to the plaintive trill of the
creek , then, rising at daybreak to count her
money, she found that by the grace of God
and the perseverance of Creech, there was a
total of over £l9OO in the sugarbag.
. -that day, also, Billy did not return, and
in the afternoon she wrapped the bag in
brown paper, and, taking the two children,
moved heavily back to town. A sympathetic
purveyor of bad news announced to her that
Willy had departed by steamer the night be-
fore, and wondered tlmt she took no steps to
stop his flight.
" illiam Spritt was in Sydney when, many
months after, news was wafted to him of
his wires prosperity. On inquiry she had
round that Creech was relationless, and she
chose to explain her wealth as a legacy from
an a_unt. Billy s own affairs had not pros-
pered in the meantime, and he resolved to
return and take command of his old ship,
bo he snatched a handbag to pay his passage
and was delayed four months. Then he
shipped as a fireman, got nearly roasted on
the trip across, and arrived in a state of
yelping rebellion against the crowded fur-
naces. finally, on arrival home, he found
i s Wl^e had divorced him for desertion.
• a t,-Y,. on l ail e^Ps to drag a bloke down,” he
said bitterly, translating his case into general
aad t ,le “ wh f. n she gits any think
she turns er back on Im.
But Billy got something, after all. He
was seized on an old count of obtaining
money under false pretences—the very money
that had taken him to Sydney—and he got
another six months.
