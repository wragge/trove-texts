COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voicfe,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned,have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr, W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

O R SBL V B SI
We wish it to be understood that the character of th
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices vvi
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessing
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stand-
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is wmrthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
never cease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
Bomewhiie baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

"So cialistic Georye”: A Sketch.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out along the Queensland border where thegidya-
scrub is dense,
And the rabbits swarm in thousands through the
breaches in the fence ;
VV here the waterholes are empty and the stock of
hunger dies,
And you have to share your damper with the bull-
dog ants and flies—
You might chance to meet a spectre on some God-
forgotten track
Wearing spectacles and boxer with a lib’ry on his
back.
It is “Socialistic Georgie”—Western bushmen
call him so—
And I easy recognised him, for he quickly let me
know
That he’d mastered Social-Science and had found
the hidden key
To the old and vexed problem which has kept thd
world “at sea.”
And in mighty learned language he explained to
me his plan
How to better the condition of the starving work-
ing man.
“Do away with priest and monarch, hurl the Fat-
man to his doom,”
And his voice grew husk and hollow, like an echo
from a tomb;
“ Take away from men Ambition !’’ he went on in
louder tone,
“And their crave for empty Mammon ! and the
rest is easy shown.
They will cultivate the country and live happy on
the soil,
And will equally, like brothers, reap tin* harvest
of their toil!”
Then he opened up his bundle, which contained a
lot of books
Most delightfully entangled with his fishing-lines
and hooks.
Bellamy and Herbert Spencer, Henry George, and
many more
Writers on the social questions of the present and
of yore,
He pulled out with great excitement, while I
watched his swag with care,
For I feared he might have hidden dynamite and
powder there. . >
“ I have read all these and often cursed the
author’s work and name,”
He exclaimed, and then a shudder shook his lean
and lanky frame.
And he jumped upon his lib’ry ; gave his starving
dog a kick ;
And “ performed ” in such a manner that I
grabbed a mnlga-stick
To defend with it my carcase, for he filled my
heart with fear,
In that lonely place and dreary, where no human
help was near.
“All those books are impositions—impositions,
nothing more!”
He remarked when he had finished yelling out for
blood and gore.
And, in milder accents, muttered: “Famous
though the authors be,
They don’t understand the question, haven’t
studied it like me ;
And before you’ll be much older, take my word
for it, young man,
You will see a happy nation freed from slav’ry by
my plan !
The December sun was setting and the gidya-
scrub grew dark,
And the jackass started laughing when I ventured
to remark :
“I admit your plan is splendid and your wishes
from the heart,
But you really never mentioned How and Where
you mean to start
Your well-meaning reformation of a billion
diff’rent minds,
And to work these ‘ grab-all ’ people on your
socialistic lines,”
He considered for a minute, then he called his dog
by name,
And packed up his books and papers and walked
back the way he came.
And I s’pose he keeps on wand’ring aimlessly
along the road,
With his poodle-dog and bundle and his literary
load. |
In my dreams I often see him with his hat upon
his swag,
Talking socialistic science to his empty tucker-
bag.

Dear Bulletin, —At Charleston, Etheridge
goldfield (N.Q.), may be seen a reputed black
leper minus one hand and part of one foot. The
white population number about 70, and their sole
water-supply during the dry season is the soakage
from a dam situate on the river above the town-
ship. On the soft sand of the river-bed about 30
blacks are camped, among them the above-men-
tioned patient. Allowing 10 dogs to every black
(rather under than over the average), this would
give about 300 mangy, half - starved, yelping
curs, which, along with the blacks, have free
access to the water used by the residents. The
blacks are, in fact, employed by the majority
of the whites as water-carriers. Inform the
police? Might as well inform the Emperor of
China, of whose subjects there are, I might add,
about 20, some fossicking and some gardening. In
this same township was recently to be seen the
edifying spectacle of an alleged woman, the worse
for drink, parading the street with handcuffs on,
and leg-irons attached to her ankles trailing
behind her. She had made her escape while the
policeman in charge had gone to a neighboring
township for a J.P. to hear the charge against
her.—T. M‘G., Charleston, May 9, ’95.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
££ TIHIIRIEIE CASTLES” and “ C-A-IPST-A-ZCsT.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

The Deadlock.
The New South Wales Council has cast out
the Land and Income Tax Assessment Bill
by 41 fossils against 4—two of the four being
the Government’s own representatives, of
whom one believed very little in the measure,
and the other (Attorney-General Want)
believed not at all. Consequently, an ex-
ceedingly complicated situation has arisen,
for which the great system of Government
by Contradiction offers no adequate remedy,
and no remedy that is even moderately
inadequate The Council was apparently
actuated by a number of different motives in
arriving at its almost unanimous decision.
Four years ago the province sent a strong
Protectionist majority to the Assembly, and
when that majority passed the Customs
Duties Bill the present Government party
called on the Upper House, by petition, and
on many public platforms, and through the
press, to squash the will of the people and
cast the Bill into oblivion. The Council did
not follow the advice then, for its personal
interests were not attacked and it was not
roused to any kind of enthusiasm, but it
probably felt a certain pleasure in acting
pow exactly as the present Government
urged it to act a few years ago. It was pro-
bably further guided by the fact that the
Land and Income Tax Bill was avowedly
intended to supply a gap in the Customs
revenue, and that gap being obviously non-
existent under Reid’s proposed revenue
tariff the alleged necessity for the measure
was not so apparent as it might have
been. It was aggravated, also, by the
bellicose attitude of the Premier, whose
avowed desire for a fight with the Upper
House has been so much advertised of late ;
and it was enraged by the still more bellicose
attitude of the Attorney-General. All these
matters combined probably accounted for
2 per cent., or about that much, of the
opposition, and the other 98 per cent, may
safely be set down to the narrowness,
Toryism, and class bigotry of the Council,
which doesn’t want a land-tax because it is
mainly a House of Landholders, and objects
to an income-tax because its own income is
much above the average.
The first result of the Council’s action is
that the legislative work of the year is prac-
tically lost. The Local Government Bill is
already gone : the Premier himself aban-
doned it rather than sacrifice the principle
of giving the large landholder a maximum
of 20 votes at municipal elections. The
Land and Income-tax Assessment Bill has
just been wrecked by a ten-to-one majority.
The Income-tax Bill now before the Assem-
bly is thus rendered purposeless and alto-
gether useless. The new Tariff Bill must
apparently be abandoned for this session if
Premier Reid really believes, as he asserts,
that it will so seriously reduce the revenue
as to make the Land and Income-tax abso-
lutely necessary to fill the void. Under
these circumstances very little remains
except much Hansard and the smellful
memory of the Dibbs-Parkes coalition
to show that there has been any session at
all. And it is more than possible that the
action of the Council may lead to a prema-
ture dissolution or to a hurried prorogation,
in which case all the other unfinished legis-
lation.will go overboard, and the session
will leave behind it no visible results what-
ever. The vehicle of Government by Con-
tradiction gets along with great difficulty at
all times, and when it meets with a very
small obstacle it breaks down altogether.
Then there is generally a dissolution, which,
in the legislative system, answers much the
same purpose as the private citizen’s habit of
going on a “drunk” when his perplexities
become overwhelming. The “drunk”
doesn’t help to unravel things in any way,
neither does the dissolution, but they are
both regarded in certain walks of life as the
orthodox thing under the circumstances.
• « «
Sydney Telegraph demands that the
Reid Government should dissolve Parlia-
ment and appeal to the country for a dis-
tinct and unmistakeable “ mandate” to carry
the Land and Income Tax at all hazards, and
then come back with a huge majority, and
introduce the measure afresh. Considering
that the present system of Government
furnishes no remedy whatever for the
difficulty now on hand, this proceeding
would be about as wise and about as
idiotic as any other. The Reid party got
a huge majority at last election, and has it
still. It also got a most distinct mandate,
in the matter of the land-tax at -all events,
and the Council has jeered at its majority
and jumped on its mandate with both feet.
If it gets another majority and another
mandate, there is absolutely nothing to pre-
vent the Council repeating the process.
Moreover, it would almost certainly come
back with a much weaker following than it
now possesses. It would go to the country
with the pathetic acknowledgment that it
had achieved practically nothing, and the
average elector only looks at results and
takes very little account of causes —so the
Government which does nothing is lost.
Even when the Minis ry has accomplished
much, instead of having a record of almost
utter blankness, the country is generally in-
furiated because it has not done much more.
Therefore, when a Ministry appeals to the
electors after serving its full Parliamentary
term, it is rejected almost as a matter of
course, and its opponents come back
with a big majority. It it dissolves after
serving only part of its term, it either
comes back with a s nail majority or a small
minority —the matter depends very much on
its length of service. It is a mere matter of
depreciation, like the wearing out of any
other machine. If the Reid Cabinet goes
to the country now it ought, in the ordinary
course of things, to come back with its
majority reduced by one-half, and with a
much less forcible mandate than it had
before; and the Council, which refused to be
overawed by its largo majority, would have
still less respect for its little one.
* * *
The next alternative is to take no notice
of the disaster, and to go on with whatever
business it may be possible to accomplish.
Premier Turner did this when the Vic-
torian Council rejected his Land-tax Bill,
but the circumstances were different. Tur-
ner’s “mandate” was practically* to square
the finances by any possible means, and his
land-tax was a matter of convenience rather
than of principle ; therefore, when it was
rejected, he proceeded to raise revenue by
other means, and accomplished his object.
Moreover, the Victorian Council is an elec-
tive body with a property qualification, and
though this renders it as Tory as that of N.S.
Wales, it also puts it so utterly beyond
Governmental control that no Ministry is
supposed to be affected by anything that
happens in the Upper House. In N.S.
Wales the Ministry has the power to ask the
Governor to allow it to appoint new Coun-
cillors, and by virtue of this semblance of
authority it is supposed to “do something ”
when the Council treats it and the country
with unusual disrespect. In nine cases
out of ten it can’t do anything at all,
and in 99 cases out of 100 it can’t do any-
thing of any real value. Still, if it fails to
do something, in such an extreme case as
the present, the Council grows more and
more arrogant until the position becomes
untenable, and the Lower House and the
people begin to view the Ministry with con-
tempt. In this instance, the Upper House
has knocked the bottom and all four sides
out of the entire Government policy, and if
it can’t be suppressed then the chief reason
for the Government’s existence vanishes
altogether.
The only visible remedy for the deadlock
is to swamp the Council with new nominees.
This can only be done by the permission of
the Queen’s shadow--the Governor, or, as
there is no Governor, by the aid of his
deputy shadow. The latter, it is almost
certain, will decline so great a responsibility,
and the former, when he arrives, will prob-
ably do likewise, as most other Governors
have done, unless under extreme pressure,
or by direction of the Imperial Government.
The authority of the Imperial Government
can probably be obtained by sufficiently
enthusiastic representations and after much
delay ; but even in such a case, and suppos-
ing the Ministry lives long enough to see the
end of the struggle, very little good will
have been done if the Council is swamped
merely for the sake of carrying the Land-tax
Bill, and for no other purpose. Out of
the 40 or 50 Democrats who must be ap-
pointed to man down the present Ti ry
majority, not ten would remain democrats
two years hence. The Upper House is
fatal to democratic sentiment. The atmo-
sphere of wealth, ease, and profound respect
for Property, the absence of any necessity to
keep abreast of the age, the feeling of irre-
sponsible authority, the freedom from all
need to consider public sentiment—which
freedom presently developes into a lofty
contempt for public sentiment and every-
thing appertaining thereto, and the undis-
guised dislike of the Assembly for the nomi-
nee House—which speedily induces a feeling
of antagonism even in the man who has
spent many years in the popular Chamber,
all these things make such a thing as a demo-
cratic M.L.O. almost impossible Moreover,
the Council is distrusted by the people, as it
well deserves to be, and cordially returns
the feeling ; and the Democrat who outers
it is distrusted because he is there and
presently learns to resent the popular
suspicion. If the Reid Government, after
many months of conflict with the Imperial
authorities, is allowed to appoint, say, 50
new Councillors, and then rush along its
Land and Income Tax Bill before they have
time to fall from grace, the measure will,
doubtless, be passed. And if that bill
represented the beginning, middle and end
of the country’s aspirations, this result would
be perfectly satisfactory. But the country
desires to keep progressing. It wants many
more things now, and will want still more
later on. And the new members will fossi-
lise just as did the old ones, many of whom
were also men of liberal ideas before they
entered the mephitic atmosphere that per-
vades the House of Old Age, and in another
year or two the ancient barrier will have
become as impassable as ever.
• * *
The Legislative Council should be swamped
for one purpose only. There is nothing to
be gained by dissolving the Assembly, which
has done its best to carry out the popular will.
There is also nothing to be gained by letting
the matter rest, which is merely postponing
the inevitable ; or by prorogation, which is
also postponing the inevitable. And there
is very little to be gained by fighting the
Council on this one point only. The most
statesmanlike course is to introduce into the
Assembly a Bill to reform the Upper House
by converting it into am elective body
appointed on a manhood suffrage basis by
the whole province voting as one constitu-
ency ; or otherwise to amend its constitution
so as to bring it into line with the popular
sentiment. When that measure has passed the
Assembly and been contemptuously thrown
out by the Council, then it will be time to
appeal to the people and get a direct vote on
that question alone—to make it the whole
political platform of the party, on the suffi-
cient ground that all other reforms of any
importance are practically hopeless until this
persistent obstruction is removed from the
path. And, having got the support of the
nation, then it would be the business of the
Government to besiege the viceroy, and the
Colonial Office, and the British Parliament,
until it secured the right to swamp the Coun-
cil with a democratic majority which could be
relied upon to abolish itself and its fellow
nominees for ever and ever. This is the
only question between the two Houses which
is worth fighting. The point on which the
Government should make a stand is not
that the Council has no moral right to veto
the popular decision in the matter of the
Land and Income Tax Bill, but that it has
no moral right to veto the popular decision
in anything, and, not having the power, its
possession of the power to do so is an
anomaly and a danger to the commonwealth.
Some day or other this matter must be dealt
with, and it may as well be done now as at
any other season.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Slaves of the Sugar Industry.
The Opposition in Q. Parliament is numerically
too small to have any practical status. It is
overshadowed, on the one hand, by a Labor
majority, pledged to a definite platform of
“ Socialism in our time,” and, on the other, by
a greater Government majority, upholding a
definite policy of spoils m their time. Charles
Powers, junior member for Maryborough, has
acted as nominal leader of this nominal Opposi-
tion, and may still be regarded as its mouth-
piece. The recent speech in which Vie laid
down the policy of the Progressive Democratic
party in the Northern province lias been re
ceived with attention no less profound than
merited. Powers is entitled to respect by his
intellectual ability, anil still more by his intel-
lectual honesty. As a party-leader he was a
modified failure under circumstances which
made failure certain. His brains are more
conspicuous than his tact : he can neither bully
nor wheedle. But friends and foes are con-
vinced of his sincerity ; and his public career
has done no dishonour to his native Aus-
tralia. There are four main points in his party
programme : electoral reform, white labour,
industrial development, and equal opportunities
given to all citizens by democratic administra-
tion. In his Maryborough speech, Powers
laid most stress on the urgent need for the
exclusion of colored labour, and quoted these
significant figures :
Death-Rate per 1000.
1890— White population .. 12*81 Kanaka .. 46*44
1891 „ „ .. 12*77 ~ .. 61*74
1892 „ „ .. 12*06 „ .. 42*74
1893 „ „ .. 12-54 x .. 52*57
1894 Registrar-General's report
notreo iveil; Bmidaberg dis-
trict (2800 Kanakas there) ~ .. 60*71
These figures are official and unchallengeable ;
yet they do not give the full force of the con-
trast. For the Kanakas are all men in the
prime of life, while the total for whites is
swollen by the inclusion of infants and
aged people—whose mortality is the heaviest
item on every list. Thus, “ summed up,” says
Powers, “ this means that we are putting
these picked men of the islands under ground
at the rate of more than one islander for every
day in every year since the traffic started.” No
wonder the islands are depopulated ! There is
“ no fuss, no funeral notice, no burial service,
nothing to shock the delicate susceptibilities of
a Christian community,” when the Leperland
Kanaka is thrust into his hole. His death is
indeed supposed to be reported to the Regis-
trar ; but a Parliamentary return shows that, in
addition to the reported deaths, there have been
3240 Kanaka disappearances. Where those miss-
ing Kanakas are, nobody knows ; but everybody
can guess. They came ; they should have gone
back, but did not. Doubtless the great majority
of them are buried at the root of Leperland’s
flourishing sugar industry. Yet the Kanaka
death-rate was the ground for only one count
in Powers’ indictment of colored labor. He
added up the leprosy, the prostitution of white
women, the mysterious crimes, the disclosures
of the Wm. MaNson trial, the proof that
unaided white labor could grow* and was grow-
ing cane profitably, the truth that the Kanaka
is but paving a way for the Javanese, the
Japanese and the Indian coolie ; and he asked
young Australia whether it would, with eyes
open, offer up race and country as a sacrifice to
Mammon. Powers’ argument lost no force, but
rather gained it, from the fact that five years
ago he advocated an extension of the term
allowed for colored labor. Five years ago
many men halted doubtfully between a know-
ledge that the Kanaka w'as a danger to
the community and a belief that he could be
temporarily utilised for the benefit of the com-
munity without much danger. But the experi-
ence of the intervening years has convinced
every one of those men, whose mind is not
dominated by personal interest or class pre-
judice, that colored labor is even now' dearly
bought; that in the future (in the words of
Griffith) “it is impossible for an inferior
servile class and a free white laboring popula-
tion to permanently exist side by side ;” and
that if the present policy be continued the
growing evil must result in national degrada-
tion and disaster. Every man who now votes
for colored labor, or for the Govt, which sup-
ports colored labor, has done his best to earn his
children’s bitter curses.
The Man from Brummagem.
Dear Bulletin, —The reign of Brummagem
continueth on Australian shores. The intelli-
gent foreigner is as anxious as ever to ex-
plain how Australia ought to be governed ;
and he is, as you have shown over and
over again, violently willing to take part
in the government of the unfortunate “colo-
nial,” at a salary. Our latest visitor, Mr.
Michael Davitt, tells us, amidst thunderous
applause, that the British working-man will
never give up Freetrade. This secured for him
the whole-souled support of the Melb. Argus,
which has applied that to mean that the example
ought not to be lost on the Australian working-
man. I don’t suppose Mr. Davitt intended to
give an opinion on local politics ; at any rate,
let us hope he differs from the average visitor,
and has no burning desire to set us right.
Some four years ago a Mr. H. H. Champion
arrived in Australia in the middle of a strike,
and immediately saw through the whole
of the intricacies of the shearing, the seamen’s,
and the miners’ war, and had a remedy at once.
The men were all wrong. Their leaders were
all asses. Recently Mr. John Burns visited
the U.S., stayed about three weeks, discovered
that the whole American State, National and
Municipal system, was rotten, depraved and
corrupt, and bestrode the various platforms
with a remedy in each pocket. Mr. Champion is
now about again with fresh ideas as to how we
should be governed. Having failed to get in for
a Scotch constituency to the Commons, having
failed as an editor of the Labor Elector, and as
an agitator, a soldier, and in various other capa-
cities in Great Britain, of course he is singularly
well-adapted to run the province of Victoria-
in fact, the continent of Australia. Naturally,
he seeks a seat in Parliament, on the
strength of six months’ residence. He
is, of course, competent to criticise the
Trades Hall, the Government, institutions
generally. One can only wonder at the
impudence of these people. Suppose I
invited you, sir, to my house, and you had
not been there a quarter of an hour before you
found fault with my whisky; suggested that the
piano should be re-tuned, and that tke picture
of my angel mother should be hung higher
or lower ; criticised the principle upon which 1
was training up my children ! What would
you think of such a thing in sober moments ?
It would be all very ill-bred and very
cheeky. Yet we are constantly finding
ourselves called to task politically and socially
by the. flotsam and jetsam of Europe. Can it
be that we bear such an absolute resemblance to
the Britishers that the absence of any national
trait of recognition about us makes us the prey
of these cock-sure travellers? Have we, in


one hundred years, developed no national
characteristic which cannot be revised out of us
bv the newest arrival on the Orient boats!
After all, I think we prefer rather to go our
own way and solve our own problems than to
depend upon the haughty services of the proud
descendants of the Urquharts. Why Mr.
Champion, before his English boots are yet
worn out, is to be held up as a political example
to the detriment of able Australians is not
apparent. I suggest respectfully, in answer to
certain paragraphs rather in his favor in your
columns recently, that if he was not good
enough for Aberdeen he is not good enough for
Victoria, and that’s not saying much for Vic-
toria. They are a canny people in Aberdeen,
and they know the Urquharts (from whom
Mr. Champion is descended) better than we do.
Victoria can do its own governing without
the aid of the decayed Scotch aristocracy. It
is better to govern ourselves, however badly,
•than to give our governing out to do to men
from Brummagem, Aberdeen, or Cork. —Yours,
Cornstalk.

Grog.
The sitting of Sydney Licensing Court last
week brought the bad-liquor question again to
the front, and gave the law a chance to stumble
to certain illogical conclusions thereon, and to
shed some additional gloom on a very awkward
problem. One of the peculiarities of the law is
that it generally does its best to avoid responsi-
bility, and, in its desire to do this, it often
makes an ass of itself. A large number
of licenses were objected to on the ground that
the holders had been convicted of selling liquor
that was unfit for human consumption, and the
Bench thereupon tried to take a comprehensive
view of the situation—said situation being
somewhat as follows: (1) When a publi-
can is convicted of selling grog that
no human being should be allowed to
drink, it is recognised that his license
should be refused at the next opportunity, and
that he should be shunted out of the trade
for the public good ; (2) the law holds
the publican responsible whether the said
liquor was compounded by him, or by the
European exporter, or the local wholesale
dealer, and whether he knew it was bad or not;
(3) the law fixes no recognised standard of good-
ness, so liquor is approved or condemned by the
public analyst according to a standard of his
own, which may or may not be correct; (4) the
wholesale dealer may sell, with almost absolute
impunity, any kind of liquor that he pleases,
and, owing to the want of supervision in his
case, no one can tell who is responsible for bad
liquor. The Court considered these points
to the best of its moderate ability—
and renewed the licenses of most of the
alleged adulterators. Almost all of them
advanced the usual pleas that they hadn’t made
the bad liquor, or bought it from any illicit
distiller, but had gob it from a reputable firm,
and sold it in the same condition as received,
and that the wholesaler was the only person
to blame. The police-court authorities always
ignore these pleas ; the Licensing Court, which
was probably just about as confused in the
head as the other court, either believed them,
or it held that it didn’t matter whether the
public was poisoned or nob, or else it recognised
the obvious fact that it had no reliable informa-
tion either way. In any case, its decision
means that somebody—whether the wholesale
or the retail dealer, or the exporter, or the
illicit manufacturer, or all combined—are to
go on poisoning the public very much as here-
tofore. The court couldn’t but be con-
vinced that an enormous amount of bad
liquor is traded off to corrode the pub-
lic liver and burn large holes in the
national stomach ; the evidence showed that
conclusively, and if the court possesses the
sense of taste it probably knew it without the
evidence. By renewing the licenses in all save
a few very glaring cases, it simply acknow-
ledged itself unequal to the occasion. It re-
cognised that the bad liquor business can’t be
abolished by sitting hard down, whether rightly
or wrongly, on the ignorant publican, and the
law has never discovered any way of sitting
effectively on other persons concerned, or even
of finding out who is concerned. And it never
will find a way until the State runs the business
itself, and is its own importer and wholesale and
retail dealer, and abolishes the illicit distiller
by abolishing the private publican who buys
his compounds, and fixes the responsibility
once for all by being itself directly and
indirectly responsible for everything. The
Licensing Court didn’t say that or anything
so unconventional, but it did its best to prove
it none the less. The whole interminable
series of prosecutions for selling bad liquor,
illicit liquor, selling liquor after hours, selling
liquor on Sundays, selling liquor to intoxicated
persons and the like, all help to prove that the
State can’t make the private grog trade go
straight, though it spends half its valuable time
in the attempt, und that the whole business
wants refixing on a new basis.
Class- Taxation.
The N.S. W. Council assigns as one reason—if
not the chief reason—for its rejection of the
land-tax, that the Bill submitted to it pro-
vided an exemption up to .£175. The holder of
land of that or less value was to go absolutely
free, therefore the measure was so obviously
one of “ class-taxation ” that the Council re-
jected it with loathing. Since then, a number
of the supporters of the Bill have been em-
ployed in an endeavor to prove that the land-
tax scheme, despite the £475 exemption, is not
class-taxation, and a lot more have apologised
for the Bill on the ground that it is a
good Bill upon the whole, and, though the
exemption is a blot upon it, the blot can be
easily removed. These two parties represent
two sections of land-taxers, and The Bulletin
now desires to speak on behalf of a third. The
Land Tax Bill, with the £475 exemption, is a
measure of class taxation. Also, it ought t > be
one, and it was distinctly intended to be > ie,
or if it wasn’t so intended it should have been.
And the laind-taxer who apologises for this
feature in the Bill, or who offers to sacrifice it
in the interests of alleged equity, lacks the
courage of his opinions. The land-tax is not
a gospel, as so many of its advocates
maintain, but an expedient for the public
good. It isn’t wanted on any principle of
abstract justice, or because of the hollow cant
phrase that “ all things come from the land,”
or for any reasons to be found in the Scripture ;
the only cause for its existence is that the pub-
lic welfare demands it. It is necessary for the
public good, either that the land should belong
to the State so that the “ unearned increment ”
may be public property, or else that the laud
should be divided up on something like an
equal basis, so that the said increment
may be shared among the nation with
a reasonable semblance of equality. The
possession of vast estates by the few re-
duces the many to landlessness, poverty,
and something very much akin to slavery,
consequently it is advisable, for the good of the
State, that something approaching to equal
distribution should be arrived at. It matters
very little how it is arrived at, so long as the
nation ultimately gets there. Land nationalis-
ation would produce the result. So, to some
extent at least, would the French law of in-
heritance. The Reid Government’s land-tax
was intended—or should have been—for the
same purpose, and to effect that purpose it
must be an impost on a class only. If the small
holding is exempt while the large one is heavily
taxed, then it becomes more profitable to
divide the soil among a multitude of small
cultivators, and a process of subdivision sets in
which tends to destroy the big estates and to
break up the land monopoly. If all land is
taxed equally, and there is no exemption what-
ever, then there is no encouragement towards
sub-division, and the big estates will remain ;
and if the land impost isn’t class taxation, then
there is very little reason, beyond the fact that
the Treasury wants money, why there should
be any such impost at all. It is not, or at all
events it shouldn’t be, so much a tax on wealth
as a fine levied on the man who grabs more than
his fair share of the country, and thereby com-
pels someone else to go short to the general
injury of the community. The ,£475 exemption
may not be mathematically accurate, but the
principle on which it is based is indisputable.
Also, if there had been no exemption, the Leg.
Council would have thrown out the Bill because
there wasn’t one.
Law in Leperland.
The Q. Full Court, consisting of Justices
Harding, Chubb, and Real, has unanimously
upheld the judgment of Chief Justice Griffith
in the case Browne v. Cowley ; and the lega-
lity of the decision may therefore be taken as
proved. As already stated, the plaintiff, a
member of Q. Parliament, sued the Speaker for
damages for forcibly expelling him from his
place in the Assembly, and preventing him from
re-taking it during a week. The Speaker based
his action on a vote of the Assembly, itself
based on an Assembly standing order. As a
matter of fact, Browne was disgracefully used,
and there was nothing to justify the ill-usage.
The questions put before the court were (1)
Was the standing order valid, and (2) Had the
Govt, majority a right to apply it in Browne’s
particular case ? The Court declined to con-
sider the second question, and held that the
standing order (passed by practically the
same Govt. majority) was valid. Into
the law points raised it is unnecessary to
enter. The resulting position is this: The
Govt, majority may prevent any opposing
member from sitting in the House for so long
as it pleases, by simply voting his expulsion.
He has no redress. His election counts for
nothing. He may be expelled for any offence
or for no offence whatever. If his presence is
unpleasant to an Assembly majority, the elec-
tors whom he represents may be altogether dis-
franchised —simply blotted out of the scheme
of representative Government. In other words,
if, out of the 71 effective members of Q.
Assembly, 36 can at any time be found un-
scrupulous enough to vote that the remaining
35 be expelled, they can do it without
showing cause by merely passing a resolution.
The minority will have no right to be heard in
self-defence, no right to reason or protest. The
majority can, without discussion, over-ride the
constitutional rights of the minority; and the
Supreme Court of the province holds that the
majority will be quite within its powers. No
more monstrous position is imaginable. Natur-
ally, the Government has not proposed to take
any steps to alter it. Nelson and Co. acquiesce
cheerfully in a decision which may be used to
tighten their grip of office. Nothing less was
expected from the most viciously partisan
administration of Australasia. Premier Nelson,
bound by his position to do equal political jus-
tice to all members of the community, is now
President of the Q. National Ass, with the
man BulcoCk as his secretary. He actually has
the insolence to issue a circular, signed by him-
self as President, pointing out that the Ass has
been formed to combat the progress of the
Labor-party and soliciting support. That is to
say, he prostitutes the office and the dignity
entrusted to him as head of the Govt, in order
to advance the interests of a class-organisation
which is now doing its utmost, by hook and
crook, to take away the franchise from all
electors suspected of Democratic tendencies !
The process of “ bulcocking ” the rolls is
steadily going forward —with the Govt, aiding
and abetting. If there were in Leperland any
public honesty, any public opinion worth the
name, such conduct would rouse a storm of in-
dignation. There is heard hardly a word of
remonstrance ! The province is drugged into
torpor.
Hebraism and Christendom.
Julian Emanuel Salomons, Q.C., must have
felt ecstatically humorous when he found him-
self not only placed among the notables on
Cardinal Moran’s lecture-platform, but even
selected as the champion of Roman Catholicism,
to move a vote of thanks for the Cardinal’s
singularly barren address on the “ Reunion of
Christendom.” Salomons projected himself at
the audience “ as one of thousands of friendly
survivors of the ancient race who had long for-
gotten and altogether forgiven the injustice of
the past.” This venom-tipped arrow launched,
the great little barrister, while admitting that
he could not give an unqualified assent to
everything Moranesque that he had heard,
deplored “ the dissensions which split up the
Christian Church into contending factions.”
The gall that could fling this touch of Hebraism
at a (chiefly) R.C. audience, and the den-
sity of the R.C. audience that could take such
sentiment seriously, are specially worthy of
each other. When, however, Julian Emanuel
further deplored that “ all that raises life above
the level of the brute is being assailed by those
to whom nothing is sacred,” and spoke of
“ masses of festering corruption, a general low
level of conduct, an almost impossibility of
getting the truth in courts of justice ” (and
Royal Commissions?), as reasons why Christen-
dom should be reunited ; even the magnetised
audience breathed hard, said sotto voce, “ Well,
he ought to know,” and thought of lots of things.
As if to throw Salomons into a relief of lime-
light, comes the comment of his fellow-Hebrew,
Rabbi Goldreich, of Ballarat (Vic.), who
doesn’t “forget,” nor does he seem to “for-
give,” dla Salomons. The Rabbi grunts that
“the poor Jew ” is left out of the proposed “Re-
union,” left to the tender mercies of so-called
Christian governments “to trample him under-
foot with savage barbarity, while enlightened
and humane Governments stand aghast, or, at
least, pretend to stand aghast, according cheap
sympathy, with folded arms, and at best afford
him stepmotherly recognition.” Yet (contends
the Rabbi) the Jew is the only dispenser of
Catholic or universal salvation. The Jew gave
the world the Bible, the Christ, and the
Apostles, and still preaches universal salvation
in his synagogues the one only Catholic
religion. And the various Christian sects are
unknowingly fighting with each other in order
to disseminate and teach the Jewish com-
pendium of revelation ! The attitudes of these
two notable Hebrews are well worth contrast-
ing. The oily gammon of Salomons, Q.C.,
and the hen-with-chickens assumption of Pastor
Goldreich!
As a supplement to the article in last issue,
The Bulletin herewith gives a statement of
“information wanted” and not supplied in
Prof. Morris’s memoir of Higinbotham, in the
sure and certain hope that it may be resur-
rected :
1. Higinbotham’s artistic, dramatic, literary,
and musical studies, tastes, and opinions.
2. His views on Berry and the Embassy.
3. His views oh the Strong Persecution, and his
attitude towards the so-called “Australian
Church.”
4. His views on Imperial titles.
5. Some true accounts of the stormy scenes at
Exhibition Commission meetings, whereat the
dignified democrat was baited by the bumptious
emissaries of Flinders-lane.
6. His sources of political inspiration and
thought.
7. His opinions of prominent contemporaries.
8. Any vigorous anecdotes of his career, those
of the sanctified Sunday-school-superintendent
genus rigorously excepted.
9. His views on capital punishment.
10. His matured views on Socialism.
In connection with the first item, The Bulle-
tin believes that Higinbotham originated the
proposal to import Cowen and his orchestra,
and knows that he was a constant attendant at
the high-class concerts that followed thereon.
Also, it knows that he, on one occasion, justified
the reading of fiction, and condemned the
French realistic novel. Furthermore, it has a
dim recollection that he seldom, if ever, visited
a theatre. But it is information much more
full-bodied than this that is wanted. The list
given by no means exhausts the list of absent
ana. It will, however, do for a preliminary
stimulus to the resurrection of a substantial
body for the Big Book that is to be.
The Dean Commission has plainly shown that
there is something seriously wrong with the
present New South Wales system of taking
notes at a trial. Even in the interests of the
Judges a change is desirable. Not only is the
mere mechanical labor involved in writing at
high speed throughout the day very great, but
it must inevitably prevent the Judge from
getting a proper grasp of the case as a whole.
No Judge can reasonably be expected to edit a
case and report it also. And when Judges sit,
as too often happens at the Central Criminal
Court, for 10 hours at a stretch, the system
becomes positively dangerous. Often, when
counsel comes to deal with something vital to
his case, it turns out that the point on
which he relies does not appear upon the
Judge’s notes. The Judge, having no idea
that it was likely to prove important, did not
take it down, and has no recollection of it, and
so counsel is left helpless. The police-courts
teach the remedy, which is simple. A clever
type-writer should take down every word of
every witness unless otherwise directed. Both
sides would then know precisely what evidence
is before the court. The Judge could still take
private notes for his own guidance and assist-
ance, but on doubtful points the notes of the
clerk would be authoritative and final.
Ed. Bulletin, —“Justice” confounds cause
and effect when he ascribes the defects in Aus-
tralasia’s prison system to the fashion in which
N.S. Wales warders are treated. It is like
saying that an ill-working machine would go
properly, provided it were lubricated with
better oil. This entirely misses The Bulle-
tin’s point, which was, as I understand it, that,
first, the machine is bad, and, secondly, it is
badly engineered. Anefficient, specially-trained
and well-treated prison staff certainly is an
essential to the success of a good system. But,
even if the staff be perfect, it can’t do more
than minimise the effects of an evil system. As
a matter of fact, the probabilities are, not that
the staff' will improve the system, but rather
that the system will spoil the staff. At
present no province recognises the semi-scien-
tific aspect of prison arrangement. Conse-
quently, no special qualifications are required
in those to whom the administration is en-
trusted. A prison chief should be something of
a sanitarian, psychologist, physiologist, and
much more than the commonplace civil-servant
that he generally is. Similarly, his subordin-
ates should be trained in their work as
thoroughly as hospital nurses are equipped for
theirs, and be much more than ordinary day
laborers. As soon as tlie prison system becomes
enlightened, so soon will the true status of
prison officials be recognised. Meantime,
nothing can be expected from an administration
that has a gag-advocate at its head and a
hangman and fiagellator at its tail. —P.M.
In answer to Judge Williams’ remarks upon
costs in a Melb. law-court last week, a wigged
craftsman delivered himself of the dreary old
gag that “ these long cases pay counsel worse
than any other cases.” The gag, if true in refer-
ence to a particular case, is an impudent fiction
at heart. A counsel engaged upon a long, try-
ing job may miss an opportunity to deal with
several lucrative little jobs at once, and he thus
earns less in one week, or fortnight, or longer
term, than he could have made by the un-
scrupulous practice of accepting more briefs
than he had time to attend to properly. But
it doesn’t necessarily follow that the “ one-
case ” shark would have been able to swal-
low a shoal of fat little fishes whilst he
was devouring the lengthy but comparatively
unnutritious barracouta. A long case is a sure
and satisfactory income while it lasts, and little
cases are not always very plentiful and very
fat. And, granting that a fashionable barrister
is in constant demand—what keeps him fashion-
able ? The occasional long case, the cause
celebre which “pays worse than any other
case.” Thereby he maintains the prestige
which is the most valuable part of his stock-in-
trade. A barrister who persistently refused to
touch long cases would soon decline in market
price. The truth of the matter is that “ these
long cases pay counsel better (in notoriety,
which means money) than any other cases.”
As a set-off to the enormous groans of Austra-
lian and Maoriiand Tories about the ruin which
is coming to pass through the Democrat policy
of the Seddon Government, the following re-
port by an unbiassed observer —the U.S. Consul
at Auckland—is worth reading :
As to the country having drifted into Socialism, it is
only fair to say that there is very little need of appre-
hension in that respect, at least for the present. At the
same time it cannot be denied that the tendency of legis-
lation appears to be pointing that way. If it be Socialism
to relieve the poor, the working man, the artisan, the
struggling small fanner and the mechanic from the bur-
dens of taxation as much as possible, and compel the
monopolist, the land-grabber, the purse-proud and the
affluent members of society to bear the weight and ex-
pense of Government, then Socialism Is certainly in full
swing here. If it be Socialism to shorten the hours of
the laborer to eight per day, and give him a half-holiday
in every week, besides at least a half-dozen
full holidays in the year under full pay, thus
affording him more time for rest, lecreation,
and intellectual development than is enjoyed by his
fellow-workers in any part of the world, then, indeed, it
is undeniable that Socialism is rampant in Maoriiand. If
it be Socialism to compel the admission of more pure air
and genial sunshine into the workroom and factory,
under Government supervision ; to teach the laborers
their rights, and how to lawfully and peaceably obtain
them ; to force the earth-grabber to either sell, subdivide,
or improve his land so that it will produce what Nature
intended it should, thereby administering to the wants of
the people ; or place the land within the reach of those
who desire homes—if this be Socialism, then indeed are
the people of this country blessed beyond all others, for
all I have enumerated, and more, are they enjoying to the
fullest extent to-day. There is a general diffusion of
wealth, no great poverty, and not a single millionaire so
far as I know. Although legislation does not directly
interfere with the laudable accumulation of thrift and
industry', yet there is no denying that the general ten-
dency is towards checking, if not absolutely preventing,
the acquisition of vast estates in the hands of individuals
or companies to the detrimentof thepeople. This cannot
in any sense be called Socialism. The men who have in-
augurated these honest, Christian reforms are not ani-
mated by any spirit of Socialism, but by a sincere desire
to promote the universal welfare, to resist the aggression
of the strong and lend a helping hand to the weak and
lowly. You may call these principles by any name you
choose, but the facts are as herein related.

Dear Bulletin, —The fact that “H” is hn
pressed with the Age correspondent’s idea (a
very ancient one, by the way) of an Australian
penal station on one of the outlying islands only
goes to indicate that “ H.” is oblivious of his-
tory and blind to contemporary circumstances.
First of all, the Norfolk Island experience
ought to be sufficient lesson to last throughout
eternity. Its record of piracies, conspiracies,
escapes, murders, outbreaks, hangings, ami
lashings are the “ preserved fruits ” of island
penal settlements, remote from civilisation and
supervision. St. Helena, the shark-sentinelled
island prison of Queensland, has been con-
demned on account of its remoteness and con-
sequent expensiveness. New Caledonia is
simply an insular Gehenna. In fact, any place
that is solely inhabited by criminals and their
keepers soon becomes an abode of savage bar-
barism and villainy. Even if experience did
not thunder so eloquently against the proposal
“ H.” applauds, the spirit of the new school of
criminology is totally opposed to all ostrich-like
subterfuges on the part of society. Society
would doubtless willingly shirk the problems of
crime by shipping criminals to island-prisons
and making believe that they did not exist.
But you can’t cure a cancer by covering it with
a plaster.— Cop.
An “ Amurrikin ” railway-expert named Pang-
borne recently arrived in Melbourne on a visit
of inspection. Before he had been there two
day he furnished some columns of interview
to the local papers showing exactly how the
Victorian railways ought to be managed and
how they are not managed at present, and
explaining how State ownership was always
extravagant and inefficient compared to “private
enterprise” as practised in the blessed U—nited
States. And the amusing part of the busi-
ness was that the Melbourne papers, with
their usual holy reverence for the foreign
“expert,” insisted on treating Bangiiorn from
Amurrika as somebody of importance,
whose views were to be taken in awful
seriousness, as those of one who spoke with
authority. The country which Banghorn
comes from is par excellence the land of railway
muddlement, mismanagement, bankruptcy,
fraud and confusion. There are 128 bankrupt
railroads in the States, and 42 per cent, of the
U.S. railroads are, or have been, insolvent.
The U.S. private enterprise lines pay smaller
returns than these of Victoria, have a far larger
proportion of accidents, are worked at much
greater expense, are, in many cases, not nearly
so well built, and yet cost much more per mile
for construction. Under which circumstances
an intelligent community should simply have
looked at Pangborn with a pitying smile, and
told him to run home to his mother. Tuere is

“A Scrap of Paper,” which is a sinful
French comedy with the wickedness turned to
harmless mirth, should give a substantial lift to
the Daore season at Her Majesty’s. This pro-
duction may be beet described as an eloquent
essay on the cussedness of inanimate objects.
Two foolish young people correspond clandes-
tinely, using a bronze figure on a bracket as their
post-office. Through a complication of circum-
stances they are separated, and the lady’s last
letter remains for long years in the bowels of the
bronze figure, and the dust and the dead flies
gather upon it. But when she is married to a
jealous baronet, and the old lover comes back and
recovers the incriminating document, she sud-
denly realises the awfulness of the situation. The
girly variety of love-letter is never dated, and
nobody can ever prove, when it turns up in after
life, that it wasn’t written after marriage
instead of before. Thereafter the comedy
is a frantic hunt for the compromising
letter. It is found in a tobacco-box and
scorched, and then left "bn the fender. A man
lights a candle with it, and throws it out of the
window, right at the feet of the jealous husband,
who picks it up abstractedly and lends the remains
of it to a dull old entomologist, to wrap a beetle
in. A precocious youth throws away the beetle,
and writes a hurried love-message on the paper.
An old maid, in ringlets, gets hold of it, and
passes it back to the dazed entomologist. Mr.
Daore gets a dreadful cold looking for it in the
damp grass, and two marriages and various other
things arise out of it. The paper leads a charmed
life until 10.35, when Stirling Whyte dodders
away with the ashes of it'in his candlestick, and
the lost beetle still on his mind.

The “ Scrap of Paper ” is a bright, fasci-
nating play, and the company treat it in a large
and capable spirit. Miss Amy Roselle reveals
herself as a lady with great capabilities
in comedy. Mr. Dacre, who makes a pic-
turesque entrance under a red umbrella with
p dnted green beasts on it, does
all through, and his pnesent character, when
c unpared to the unfinished, leggy deceiver in last
week’s tragedy, raises his local reputation many
degrees. Zenobia, the spinster with the cork-
screw curls and the baleful spectacles, is finely
rendered by Miss Kate Bishop, and Scot Inglis’s
baronet is about bis happiest effort up to date.
Sundry other people, including a nice girl, and an
old man who is gone in the back and the memory,
and a small boy who wants to fight a duel, also
!*ave a pleasing impression behind them ; and
somebody tells a weird parable, based on tea, to
the effect that you should pour boiling water over
your sweetheart, and then throw it away, in order
to extract the full flavor of the lady.

Miss Amy Roselle recites “ Rizpah,” all
by herself, as an afterpiece. “Rizpah” is a
dreadful story about Bones. A young man had
been hanged, and remained hanging according to
law until the weather and the crows ate him
away, and the dickey-birds sang on his vertebrae
by day, and his dry remnants clattered on the
gallows upon windy nights. Then at last his
bones began to drop off, and his mother gathered
them up one by one on many lonesome midnights,
and buried them in holy ground. When the last
bone was buried she told her story in verse—and
died. It was a great effort of elocution, and the
audience listened spell-bound. Her Majesty’s has
been growing more and more fashionable of late,
and consequently the hum of conversation is at
times almost as aggressive as in the d.c. of the
Lyceum. But even the most fashionable auditor
stopped talking to listen to that dreadful narra-
tive of Bones.

Miss Maggie Moore has closed her Sydney
season, and the Irish drama is having a well-earned
rest, and Mr. Oily Deering, the humpy process-
server of “Sweet Innisfail,” is presumably trying
to straighten his back to its ordinary shape. The
Royal is now being painted and re-decorated,
which should do that well-worn house a lot of
good. Also, Rev. Haskett Smith has departed,
and has left a good-sized blank behind. Rev.
Haskett was an interesting personage, and he
disseminated more information during his brief
stay than any other of the Most-Travelled
Smythe’s stars up to date.

The “Gaiety Girl” still toils not to any
great extent, neither does she spin to an alarm-
ing degree, at Sydney Lyceum. Careful in-
spection of that fairy-like production leads to the
idea that there is very little meat in it and not
much bone, and whoever desires solid hunks of
literary steak will have to go elsewhere. But, in
its own butterfly fashion, the piece goes well. It
bears the same relation to the ordinary drama
that a perfumed sigh does to 81b. of underdone
meat, and though man cannot live on perfumes
and must needs yearn after coarse, prosaic bull-
beef, yet they are very pleasant now ‘ and then.
Blanche Massey seems to prow colder as time goes
On, and languishes beautifully under the false
accusation like a wronged maiden at the North
Pole. The Bulletin begins to be troubled with
a fear that the lovely Blanche suffers from cold
feet. Grace Palotta doesn’t act any better,
but her smile grows upon the audience
more and more violently every evening. So
does Madge Rossell’s famous dance, and
the gorgeous high kick, and the beautiful respon-
dent. Louis Bradfield is very little seen in this
production—he is not much more than a rumor at
the back of the stage—so Sydney hasn’t yet
formed an opinion of him. But its views concern-
ing Monkhouse and Bantoek are so far favorable,
and the latter doesn’t now come in quite"* such a
moderate second as reported last week. Also,
people snigger quietly to themselves in the street as
they remember Fred. Kaye as the Major. Little
Decima Moore has ifnfortunately been ill, and the
aching void thus created has been about three-
parts filled by Miss Sophie Elliott. Nobody
could quite fill D'eckna’s part except Decima
herself.

Two new artists from America— one of
them a rather pretty lady who goes by the dread-
ful name of Miss Lottie Medley Murphy—appeared
at Sydney Tivoli on Saturday, and furnished
reasonable justification for the money spent on
their passage. Also, the Sakers reappeared and
got a great reception, and the battle-axe juggler
was in good condition and did some hair-raising
feats with that olde Englyshe weapon.

The variety co. at Sydney Empire seems
to have settled down for a long season. George
Buller, formerly of Dampier’s co., a manager and
actor of high ability, now manages the show, and
a lot of capable comedians are oh the programme.
** * *
“The Masqueraders/' so effectively pro-
duced in Sydney three months ago, is putting in a
week’s run at Melb. Princess’. Up to the end of
the third act the “ The Masqueraders ” is a power-
ful story, although bizarre in construction and
false in sentiment. Henry Arthur Jones always
aims at originality, and hits the unreal, wherefore
his problem plays come and go, and leave no
lasting impression. And because the public feel,
rather than observe, the artificiality of his work
they don’t take it to heart. It is novel, even
startling, but it doesn’t convince. There’s no
enduring truth in the philosophy of H. A. Jones,
nothing but earnest cant and conventional snob-
bishness. Nor is the serious Jones likely ever to
write a really fine play ; since he lacks a sense of
humor with which to detect his own absurdities
and pull himself up short occasionally.
* * *
The heroine of “The Masqueraders” is
introduced to us as a well-bred barmaid who has
never been kissed. Dulcie Larondie is not other-
wise-very admirable. She flirts with an obvious
scamp for the sake of his title and coin. A dreamy
astronomer worships her, and she, with true bar-
maid perversity of instinct, speaks slightingly of
the romantic creature. Being a woman, as well
as a damsel who sells drinks, she is afterwards
prompted by circumstances to kiss her respectful
juggins on his brow. The gentle smack of that
impulsive caress ought to be the keynote of her
character, but it isn’t. Dulcie marries the
scampish baronet'and makes no apparent effort
to reform him. Her bearing towards him is
certainly not influenced by the doctrines of
the marriage-service. The baronet’s spirituous
breath offendeth her nostrils, the baronet bids her
sell her favors, yet matrimony with this noxious
fellow, for whom she never felt a thrill of real
affection, has transformed the reckless girl of the
first act into a paragon of propriety. The astrono-
mer loves her more.than ever. Dulcie draws upon
his bank-account and loves him in return, not
with the flesh-and-blood love of an impulsive bar-
maid, or of a wife driven by harsh treatment to
find a consoler, but with a most respectable love
that can look the marriage-service in the face
without turning an eyelash. Ultimately the
astronomer risks .£200,000 on the even money
chance of winning Dulcie and her child from the
beastly baronet. The bdst two out of three outs
with the cards is to decide it—beastly baronet wins
astronomer’s money or astronomer wins the queen of
his heart, with b.b.’s baby thrown in. The baro-
net didn’t care a curse about his child ; his wife’s
virtue he had been willing to sell for £2OO in the
previous act,/in t now he professed an intense de-
sire to retain his family. He doesn’t say “Give
me £lOO,OOO straight out, and damme ! they are
yours.” He cuts the cards with childish eager-
ness and nervousness impossible in a hardened
sassiety gamester, and turns into a jelly-fish when
fortune goes against him. The gambling scene is
splendidly dramatic, but wholly inconsistent with
facts at the time and afterwards.
* *
There is a fourth act to “ The Masquer-
aders,” where Duloie’s irritating dove-colored
sister, and the astronomer’s demented young
brother come in and hear “the voice of God”
crying that legal prostitution in the arms of a
brandy-scented horror is better than a high moral
love unsanctified by a parson’s blessing. Also,
Dulcie hears the Voice. It persuades the ex-
barmaid that her sweetheart’s reverential embrace
would be “more horrible” than the loathsome
hug of her hioouppy baronet. Likewise, the
astronomer hears the Voice, and rushes away to
his doom, and the voice of Nature moans the
requiem of buried hopes and busted happiness as
the curtain falls. If the dignified clergy don’t
erect a statue to H. A. Jones, they ought to be
ashamed of themselves. The characters of hus-
band and wife are excellently filled by Titheradge
and Miss Olliffe. The new actress can’t be
great in the preposterous last act, but she
glorifies the other three, and her “ yes ”
when asked if she consents to be gambled for is a
stroke of genius. Titheradge is spared inclusion
in the last act. He falls flabby beside the card-
table and quits the drama full of honors and
strong drink. Mr. Elwood’s first appearance, as
the astronomer, was less of a brilliant success, on
account of his monotonous voice vibration. As-
tronomers, however, are not every-day people, so
Mr. Elwood’s voice and manner were probably
suited to the part. Miss Faber, as the dove-
colored sister, conveys the necessary idea that she
is on terms of intimacy with the celestial host,
whilst 15 other people throw side-lights on this
sinful’ world. “The Masqueraders,” as already
remarked, is for a week only. On Saturday the
B. and B. Go. will interpret “The New Woman,”
by Sydney Grundy, for the first time in Aus-
tralia.
“The Fatal Card” appears to be doing
the triek for Bland Holt at Melb. Royal. A well-
written story which opens with a roaring night in
a bar-room, and is finally blown up by an infernal
machine, could hardly fail to attract attention,
apart from its first-class murder, the incident of a
desperado’s escape from Judge Lynch on the
boiler of a passing locomotive, and a naked
comedian paying his addresses to a young lady
with his fishing-rod. Gentle Jim continues to
earn strong marks of disapproval from his com-
panions in crime, whereas Miss Hilda Spong
grows in favor 1 and her latest burst of distress on
Walter* Baker’s account is regarded as the best
specimen of emotion that his sufferings have ever
wrung from her. Miss Spong has in former times
shared a lot of Baker’s grief without seeming
much upset.

Frederick Villiers, the great war corres-
pondent, has nm his course at Melbourne Bijou,
and gone to other cities, lamented by all who
didn’t hear him. Those who did hear him are
tortured by remembrances of a cast-iron lecturer
telling them nothing worth the hearing concern-
ing matters which he didn’t thoroughly explain,
and this not in honest descriptive English, but in
gingerbread journalese. The variety shows stand
where they stood last week, but the Haunted
Swing was put up to auction recently, and Mac-
Mahon has taken the Kinetoscope for a tour.
The drama is a strong one,
With thrilling scene,
But O ! the villain of the piece
Is wondrous crushed and mean.
In language Ibud and stormy,
By comrades stern and grim,
That person mild is much reviled
They call hvm Gentle Jim.
Way out at Colorado
The villain first is found ;
A lawless mate upbraids him. for
A selfish, crawling hound ;
But with his bold abettors
He’s always in the swim,
And when there’s dirty work to do
They send for Gentle Jim.
In London he is willing
To sneak, at duty’s call,
A pile of bonds from Baker’s dad,
Or like a burglar fall.
And, whilst he’s getting ready,
It is thecaptain’s whim
To signify contempt and scorn
For catspaw Gentle Jim.
He slaughters Baker’s parent,
He lays the old ’uhflat ;
The haughty captain of the gang
Gets on to him for that.
And when the spoil’s divided
Within a cottage dim,
His comrades three they all agree
In loathing Gentle Jim.
Poor villain of the drama !
His lot is truly hard—
The other men are leading trumps,
But he’s “The Fatal Card.”
And when the game is over
We sympathise with him,
Despised and cursed on every hand
Unhappy Gentle Jim.

Any reference to the Jews is strictly forbidden at one
Sydney theatre, the penalty for disobedience being instant
dismissal—which taboo has arisen from the fact that a
few thin-skinned Hebrews object to funny stories con-
cerning the 'Chosen.
Singers have curious whims. The late Vi. Yarley was
very ambitious to sing in Melh. Town Hall, where, she
was convinced, her voice would be heard to better advan-
tage than in a theatre. To gratify her, a concert was to
have been held prior to her trip to England at the end of
the year.
The Nellie Stewart who goes ’Ome this time is a vastly
superior actress to the Nellie they saw in “ Blue-Eyed
Susan.” Then she was full of affectations, and The Bul-
letin predicted her failure. To-day the clever woman is
at her best. Careful observation of all that was worth re-
membering in-London and Paris opera performances
effected a really surprising change in “our Nellie,” and
if her voice holds out she will “ knock ’’ New Babylon
at the first opportunity.
Dear Bulletin,— Y<\ur picture of Nellie Stewart at 18
recalls O. Wilde’s remark: “Youth is not an affectation,
it is an art.” Nellie has acquired this art long since she
was 18
At eighteen Nell looked thirty-six,
But Nature made it all serene.
For she reversed her order, and
At thirty-six Nell looks eighteen.— Snell.
As Geelong Liedertafel persists in its intention to pro-
duce “ Pinafore," the local Protestant Ministers’ Associa-
tion rises to the occasion and “strongly urges members
'of our churches not to countenance the performance of
this profane play.” This is Gilbert’s reward for his deter-
mination to write nothing that might' make a young
maiden blush. He did not count upon the old women.
Poor Oilbertl He could write nothing dull enough to be
considered ohast J’by Geelong parsons. Just think of the
concatenation— Geelong parsons! Parsons are the dullest
people on earth, and Geelong is the dullest place in the
universe—heaven and hell thrown in.
Grace Noble leaves B. and B. to go ’Ome early in Sept.,
an I Hilda t Spbng takes her place. If the fair Hilda can
only subdue her tendency to excessive ongbongpwawng,
ahe should fgo rapidly ahead as a first-class mummer
under “Bouev's" excellent discipline.
The B. and B. Melb. season, so tar, has been the worst
on record. The needy playgoer spent his last shilling to
gaze on the Oatety girlhood, and he refuses now to pawn
his shirt for the purpose of thinking hard over the im-
moral problems of Grundy, Jones and 00. Ha is saving
up until some more legs come along.
The Melb. Bijou and Alexandra are thirsty quicksands,
awaiting capitalists.
Dear Bulletin,—A “Poverty Point" par. "pokes
borak" at a certain Melb. musical critic who attends
Marshall Hall’s concerts, armed with an appalling score,
and follows the performance note by note. This is not
absurd a spectacle as the ssme critic doing the
same thing at aW. and M. comic-opera show. He might
have been seen forming his opinion of “ Nitouche," for
instance, with the aid of the musical score. Even a ballet
is judged by the orchestra’s fidelity to the blessed book.
One wrong note from a careless cornet would seem of
greater importance to this wise man than 12 beautiful
kicks by the same number of delightful legs.—Yours,
Philistine.
“ Yours Merrily ” has ,got his rule nisi against Minnie
Palmer, who, on her side, professes to be delighted. She
has confided to a reporter that “ men are very nice, but
not as husbands.’’ knmortal aphorism!
Irving (writes a Bulletin correspondent) made a capital
chairman at the Savage Club annual dinner at Holborn
restaurant. He closed the Lyceum for the night to be
free. He made a really capital, witty speech, and was
unanimously elected a life member. Certainly his chair-
manship at this particular juncture will give a great fillip
to' the old Club. Amongst those present were Poet
Sladen, Gov. Billrobinson, and Phil May. It must
have cost Irving at least £350 to close the Lyceum that
evening.
The Langtry lately appeared in a new play in New
York. In the third act she appeared with “her brow
encircled by a magnificent diamond coronet. Festoons
of diamonds draped the lovely shoulders of the Jersey
Lily." Wrote a critic: “She was as impressive as the
chandelier in the * Boston Theatre,’ which has always
been considered the finest thing in crystal gas-fixtures
ever produced in this world or likely to lie In the next.”
People are asking where the Censor of Plays is, and
how he came to license such a production as H. A.
Jones’s, “ Triumph of the Philistines,” &c., at the St.
last week, in which a cocotte (quasi artist’s
model) is shown on the stage unblushingly plying her-
trade? We have seen (writes The Bulletin’s London,
correspondent) New Women and Women with a Past, but;
this is the first time,'so far as I recollect, that such a.,
startler has been exhibited on the stage. No wonder that-
Mr. Jones received such an unflattering reception at the-
end of the play, which, I sincerely trust, may have but a-
short life. Miss Juliette Nesviile wears some very bizarre-
gowns—such as only one of her supposed calling would”
have the hardihood to put on her back.
W. and M. marked the Gaiety company’s Melbourne -
and Adeiaide-success by an all-round weekly increase ot :
10s. in the salaries of the choristers.
George Edwards has cabled assent to an extension of’
the Gaiety season for another seven weeks, but, at time of’
writing, nothing had been definitely arranged between the
Firm and the principal members of the co. Their ■
original Australian engagement was for 14 weeks only.
“ For a quarter-share in the first fighting kangaroo, £lOO <

Bankrupt paid from £4 to £lO each for four kangaroos,
which he took to America. For one he received £350;:
for another, £9O or £lOO ; for a third, a doe, about £3O ;
the largest, for which he could have got £BOO, died..
Bankrupt received about £4OO from showing the kan-
garoos.”
“ 8.E.” : At the outset you denied the truth of a plain;,
harmless statement of fact. The Bulletin had stated 1 ,
without the least desire to disparage your clever friends,
the acrobats, that something went wrong with the Living
Bridge, at Melb. Royal one night, whereby the “invisible
wire-trick became very visible to the audience.” Mr.
Bland Holt would, of course, have contradicted the
.statement had there been a grain of untruth in it. You
took upon yourself to contradict it "on your own." You
said that the acrobats couldn’t have invisible wires con-
cerned in the feat unless they wanted to cut themselves
into halves, &0., &o. What really occurred at Melb.
Royal was this. The top acrobat, in falling across the
mimic chasm, failed to grip the strap at the opposite
bank. The bridge, therefore, was only supported on one
side of the chasm, and it ought to have swung down against
the “cliff”—but it didn’t. The three men remained
suspended in mid-air by the wire-ropes attached to their
belts (your second letter suggests that you know all about
the arrangement), and the curtain was lowered hastily
to give the Bridge a chance to adjust itself. Now, when
your original contradiction was ridiculed by “ J. T. Mao.,"
you wrote again, denying that any wire or any trickery was
used in the Living Bridge feat. By the wav, Mr. George
Rignoid had already given the game away, but no matter.
You said in your second letter, “ Will * J. T. Mac.’ explain
how Miss Spong could cross the Living Bridge? Perhaps
she dodged the wires, or swung herself round them,
stanchion-wise 1” That’s just what Miss Spong, and Mrs.
Holt after her, did. They dodged the wires or swung
round them, stanchion-wise.
Dear Bulletin, —In return for the loss of my scalp, let
me mildly point out to the gratuitously ferocious “ N."
that to require me to vindicate my indictment of
“ ” by “sending along a gross or
two of my own ” is no more reasonable than it would be
to preclude me from calling the three-card-trick a swindle
unless I could perform it myself. With regard, also, to
what is practically “ N.’s ” abuse of the other side,
I should be quite as much justified in predicting,
from “N.’s” approval of Wilde’s work, his approval
also of Wilde’s practices, as “N.” is in insinuating
that my opinion of the productions has been modified
by the disgrace of the producer—that it is an enviously
disingenuous opinion—and that I am necessarily a “small
critic" because I have not the felicity of agreeing with
an inferentially great one. Beyond which, since I have
neither space nor inclination to carry the war properly
into"N.’s” territory, let me simply wish him, with Don
Farrago, “ either a feebler foe, or a better temper!”—M.

When Mayor Snowden was asked to allow
the Davitt procession to pass down Oollins-street,
Melb., from Spencer-street station, on a Saturday
afternoon, he refused, on the alleged ground that
it might block the tramway at Elizabeth-street
or Swanston-street. He said, however, that the
procession could go down Bourke-street if it liked.
But if a block was possible, it was more likely to
occur in Bourke-street, where there are more
people on a Saturday than in Collins-streefc
—as deserted at 3or 4 p.m. as at midnight.
Yet, a few days after Davitt’s arrival, a procession
of 300 or 400 butchers’ carts was allowed to parade
Collins-street in the middle of an ordinary working
day; and while loaded trams were in full swing.
So much for the impartiality of Mayor Snowden. *

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, bub it had one drawback— the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this impeitfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion v of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.
The Wild-Cat Column.
Ifc is announced that the big firm of Golds-
brough, Mort and Co., Limited, intends applying to its
debenture-holders for a reduction of interest from 5 to
8 per cent. When the oonoern reconstructed in ’93 the
debentures were fixed on the 5 per cent, basis—which
certainly looks like an atrociously high rate ; and as there
■gt ere £2,450,000 worth in circulation the interest repre-
sented £122,500 per annum. The proposed change, if
effected, will save £49,000 a year, which will he avast
relief to the overburdened co. Goldshrough, Mort and
Co., with its £2,450,000 of debentures, £600,000 owing in
Other<directions, and only £403,000 of paid-up'capita), is
obviously top-heavy, and if it had a great deal more local
capital, and a great deal less money borrowed in England,
it would get on much better.
• • • •
If Goldsbrough, Mort and Co., the Gity of Mel-
bourne Bank, and the Australian Deposit and Mortgage
Bank, which are all appealing for a reduction of interest,
carry their reconstruction schemes through, the amount
which Australia has to send to England in the shape of
interest on British capital will be reduced by £lOO,OOO per
annum. Which is one good feature in the case, at all
events.
*•■ * *
The Colonial Bank of Australia got its second
re-construction scheme through almost without a mur-
mur. The reduction of deposit interest to 2J per cent,
was carried by a vast majority; the depositors merely
stipulating that the interest was to be raised to 3 per
cent, if the profits would admit, that they were to nom-
inate three of the directors while the present arrange-
ment lasts, and that no divs. were to be declared until the
depositors were paid. An obtrusive person named Pin-
schof endeavored to distinguish himself by proposing a
rival reconstruction scheme of his own. Mr. P. wanted
to issue “A” mortgage bonds at 5 per cent, interest for
half the existing deposits, and “ B ” mortgage bonds at 4
per cent, for the other half, the “A” bonds to be re-
deemed in a complicated fashion on three separate prin-
ciples. The interest on the “B ” bonds was to he paid if
the bank could manage it, and) failing that, it was to
remain unpaid. Pinsohof went to a considerable expense
in advertising his scheme, which certainly possessed some
advantages, but (everybody not being a Teuton with a
chess-board mind) the depositors couldn’t wrestle with its
various complications and gave it up.
♦ * * *
The City of Melbourne Bank, which commenced
its reconstruction proceedings long before the Colonial,
hasn’t even been heard from lately, and the manager is
still understood to be struggling with the Scotch and
English depositors, and explaining things at great
length. Probably by this time the City of Melbourne
people have begun to fully realise that British capital is
not anything like the thing it is cracked up to be. If the
Colonial had also possessed a great mass of British
depositors the chances are that its reconstruction would
have dragged along wearily for six months or
more, to the misery and exasperation of every-
body concerned. Since the Colonial took its plunge
and got through successfully, it is an open secret
that two or three other hanks think seriously of doing
likewise. The trouble with them, however, is that they
all hold a considerable amount of British deposits and will
have to call meetings in Great Britain and various pro-
vinces of Australia, and apply toquite a number of courts
for sanction, before anything can be done. And at any
one of these various stages an aggravated Judge with a
liver may destroy the whole scheme. Failure in such a
case wou'ld be disastrous and would probably, mean
liquidation, and under these circumstances it is just pos-
sible that they_will try to struggle through on the pre-
sent basisf In that case, the Colonial, with its reduced
rate of interest, should get a long start.

Melh. bonded-store keepers are “sick” just
now. Prior to Reid’s budget, the re-imposition of the
N.S.W. tea-duty was feared, and, as a consequence, an
enormous weight of tea was exported to the Harbour
City, emptying the bonds. Now the bond men are nightly
dreaming of the arrival of new season’s stuff (due in
July). At no previous time have the Melb. bonds had
such empty stomachs.

Ed. Bulletin, —Re a recent Bui.irtin para-
graph anent the values of the V’VL. Bank lottery
prizes:—(1) There was no prize of £6OOO value drawn for
in the lottery. There was a prize of £6500, and, on a por-
tion of the property, a first mortgage of £lBOO, which the
mortgagees hesitated to release, as they considered the
security hard to beat. This property, or rather the por-
tion on which the mortgage rested, was valued by the
Govt, assessor at £5500, and the winner has not sold, but
is making arrangements to work. Further, the other
prizes which come nearest to this prize in value are the
first prize of £26,000 and the fourth prize of £l5OO, neither
of which have been sold. (2) With reference to the tenth
Erize valued at £750, and the alleged offer of £l5O, it cannot
e taken as any criterion of value, as three independent
valuators affirmed the value of this property at the price
stated in the lottery list ; and, bad as times are in Tas-
mania, they are not so bad but that considerably more
than 12s. per acre (246 acres) could be realised for a farm
of good land, well situated, close to a railway-station, and
within 30 miles of Hobart. (3) As to the city allotment,
value, £lOO, said to be worth perhaps £2O, this statement
1s rather severely confounded by the fact that the
trustees of the bank have, dnring the liquidation, sold,
lor cash, two adjacent allotments nob one whit better at
£lOO each.—Very truly yours, A Shareholder.

The Manly Co-operative Steam Ferry Co.

issue of 15,000 shares of £1 each, of which Is. per share is
payable on application, Is. on allotment, and the balance
by calls of Is. at intervals of not less than a month. The
Co-operative Ferry Co. has proved a splendid investment
up to date, the profits for the last half-year be|ng
equal to 131 per cent, per annum on the exist-
ing small capital. Also, the Co*, had, on 30th
April, £929 accumulated profit on hand, which amount
has since increased, so that one 7 per cent. div. on the
new issue is practically provided in advance. The new
capital is wanted for the purchase or construction of
boats, so as to save the heavy outlay now incurred for
rent of-steamers, and also with anview to providing vessels
of a better class than those at present in use.

One of the leading Londonderry promoters, says
a London paper, parted with his profits, which saved his
estate from the auctioneer’s hammer, before the collapse';
consequently, he was not able to follow Col.j North’s
example in guaranteeing a return of flotation profit. Few
rich men find their way to Coolgardie. People go there
to become rich.
* * * *
Why oan’t some Coolgardie correspondent send
something definite about-the new find in the Londonderry?
People get too much “rich as ever” and too little
measurement. What is the length of the rich ore„ shoot ?
The sinking of-a winze would indicate that. They have
passed it and it is short. Is it above the drive? And, if
so, why don’t they rise on it? The winze is down 10ft.,
and though two or three leet of comparatively poor quartz
was passed through, the bottom is declared to be wonder-
fully rich. If it is as rieh as the surface hole they should
have got at least, 10,000 oz. out of six feet of the winze
and another 10,000 oz. from the drive ; and 20,0000 z.
would boom the shares beyond par. They aren’t above
par just now.

Dr. Simon, the' French buyer of Coolgardie

(from the newspaper accounts) to purchase several mines
every week. Those reported last week were the Perse-
verance, the Viking, Norseman and the Mt. • Barker
Reward. Price for the lot, £70,000. Only fair that the
buyer of a job-lot like that should get ’em cheap. Two
weeks ago the Doctor negotiated for the New Victoria
qnd Bendigo Ooolga'rdie. Now-stated he will close for the
first and has declined the latter. If true, the language of

Rain all over the Coolgardie goldfields, and one

Great Boulder (Hannan’s) —122 tons, 1016 oz.
This mine has turned the table on. tjrmy a man’s predic-
tion. After it was floated in London shares dropped to a
few shillings, and for a time they disappeared from the
Exchange-list. The existence of the present rich ore-body
was then practically unknown. The Bulletin learns
from a well-known mining examiner that the show is
looking remarkably well.
*’ * * ♦
The Lake View and Iron Duke, two more of the
Boulder mines, are doing well. Tho first is div.-paying
and the second will be if it keeps up 2oz. average.

Specimens “as rich as the Londonderry ” have
been found in the Carnage, at the 45-Mile, Coolgardie.
Nearly time something was found in this mine, which has
been working over a year and has never yet had a

* * ♦ ♦
Ivanhoe (Hannan’s), 69 tons 1620 z. This mine
fcg several months has kept up an average of over 2oz.
from a lode running from 2ft. to 4ft. wide, hut with a
small battery of five head, and without water for a bigger
one, the outlook for divs. Is not too promising.
*** . *
Ironclad, Marble Bar, W.A. ; “Cleaned up 350

Here is a Coolgardie manager who should be
sacked insta'nter. Listen to him : “Melbourne G.M. Co.
cut through reef in north’ crosscut, could not find any
gold. Drove crosscut east 9ft., passed through a quartz
vein a foot thick—no gold. Costeened l’3ft. on ironstone
out-crop without finding gold.” The shareholders will
vet have that man’s blood.
• * * *
S. Gifford, representing John Taylor and Sons,
a big English mining firm, is back in Coolgardie from
London. He was there tor months last year and got
nothing. Now stated that “recent developments have
altered his opinion of the field.”
• * * *
The reef in the 380 ft. level of Bayley’s is declared
to be lift, wide, but correspondents are distinctly silent,
about that rich “bonanza.” It must have cleared out
instanter, as it didn’t wait long enough to affect crush-
ings, the last four of which averaged 15dwt. only. That
is about the cost of crushing when the co. has to pay for
water! Shares stil.l 10s.; market value, therefore,
£24o,ooo—an enigma only explained by the fact that the
bears ar.e enormously over-sold. Australia is so denuded
of sprip that brokers can only deal with buying orders
from London.
* * * *
From Coolgardie : “ The blacks around Danns-
ville are very troublesome.” The blacks probably think
the boot is on the other leg. The writer heard one Cool-
gardie man boast that he had killed more W.A. blacks
than they had killed whites altogether, and that he had
burnt eight in one wood-heap. Adding that they burn
best with their legs outward—a very handy thing to know.
* * * *
Coolgardie makes a poor show in crushings as
compared with puffings. The export of, 85650 z. for May is
about equal to the yield of a second-rate Easternfleld,
and falls much below that of first-rank fields like Charters
Towers or Rockhampton. The total Westralian gold-
export; per month, in fact, is less than any one of half-a-
dozen Eastern centres of production. Admitting the
possibilities of the future, is it not time something prac-
tical began to be shown?
The Murchison May yield was 65620 z.; Pilbarra,
27190 z.; Yilgarn, 1288 oz.; and Kimberley, Dundas, and
Ashburton, 710 oz. among them. These figures are, how-
ever, given as those exported only : possibly the actual
yield was considerably greater. Returns of tonnage, by-
the-by, are always lamentably wanting‘from Westralian
newspaper mineral statistics.
• * * *
Some men in W.A., with an eye to big biz, have
offered to build the Coolgardie railway for £61,000-much
less titan half the estimated cost. Of course ttiis tender
has been described in newspapers as absurdly low—a hint
that the contracts should be given to some other firm;
The disappointment of some tenderers can be well im-
agined. With thousands of tons nf machinery goinfr to
the field besides the ordinary traffic, and remembering
what was made by the contractor of the Southern Cross
line before it was taken over, the Coolgardie line offers
every temptation for cheap construction in the quickest
time on record. If the successful tenderers have com-
plied with the preliminary conditions, it is their business
as to whether the price is absurdly low, and they should
get the contract, There are already too many Govt,
scandals in W.A. without adding another here.

“ Negotiations proceeding for the erection of an
additional 30 head on the Big Day Dawn, Cue, which,

Wilson, of the Investors’ Review, remarks

failed.

Squads are leaving Coolgardie daily for Lake
Cowan, the scene of the latest rush, where alluvial has
been found at the base of a big ironstone hill. To await
confirmation of a new rush at Coolgardie is to get there
when it is worked out. The Lake is 65 miles away, and
over 1000 men are there already.

“The Central Exploration Co., which bought

One Westralian claim is known as the Bread-
and-Water, from the manager’s cheerful habitof retailing
those necessaries to his men. His price for water is 6d.
per gallon ; you can get it elsewhere for 4d.~but, some-
how, all the men on that mine prefer to take it at 6d.
They want to be friendly, perhaps.

At the Island, Lake Austin, W.A., writes a
Bulletin correspondent, the mining outlook is by no
means roseate. Alluvial nearly worked out. Two English
co.’s practically monopolise the Island. Their combined
staffs would be more than equal to managing Mt. Morgan.
Also, each runs a 10-head mill in a spasmodic sort of a
way. One of them actually keeps going six hours a day.
Carting water over four miles for boilers ! What prospect
divs. with watered slocks, very short and patchy shoots
of gold, and the bulk of the lode stuff very so so?

The British B. H. is raising the wind by a sale
of carbonates, stacked for some time on the surface, to
Block 14. The stuff goes about 22 per cent. lead and 750 z.
silver. A thousand tons have been delivered.

Junction (8.H.) will not venture yet on a ship-
ment of concentrates to Europe, but sends a good trial
parcel to Dry Creek. The machine is making a good deal
of slimes, but is keeping the lead above 60 per cent, and
the zino at about Iff per cent.
* * ♦ *
Attacks are being made on the resolution of the
directors of Block 10 to erect big concentrating works,
and the return of the w-eek ended June 13 is being
quoted to show that the experimental plant is losing 40
per cent* of the lead and 60 per cent, of the silver. That
return is not, however, a fair one ; for the ore dealt with
that week was largely stuff stored on the surface for
many months, and reduced by atmospheric action to
powder, producing much slimes, which are not counted
in the ordinary return.
• • * *
Broken Hill people still feel a little chagrined
at the transference of popular attention from the Barrier
to Coolgardie. Wherefore, with respect to Coolgardie’s
export of 85650 z. gold for May, they point out that they
sent away 50 per cent, greater value in lead than that —
£48,000 worth, in fact.
* * * *
The Central sale has now been confirmed, and
the names-of the persons comprising the purchasing
syndicate are still unknown. The general impression is
that it is a Melb. syndicate, and that the only thing
Yankee about it is the sulphide treatment process.
* * * *
A recent and fairly typical week’s work at the
Block 10 concentrators is held up as evidence that the
results attained are not much to enthuse over. It is put
this way :—Crude ore treated, 342 J tons; containing 78
tons lead, 92 tons zine, and 11,3020 z. silver. Value of
constituent metals: lead, £780; zinc, £1104; silver,
£1412; total, £3206. Concentrates recovered,’B2 tons,
containing 41 tons lead and 37930 z. silver. Value of
metals : lead, £4lO ; silver, £475 ; total, £BB5. The value
(unstated) of the slimes sold has to be added to the latter;
nevertheless, not a third of the metal in the crude ore is
saved. A thousand years hence someone will write a
treatise on the incapable metallurgy of the ancient Aus-
tralians.
Very little is heard of the Block 10 slimes save
that they are sold to local smelting-works. The manage*
ment is not altogether proud of the fact that they are
rather plentiful, and that they have assayed very often
quite close to lOOoz. of silver per ton. No wonder they
can be “ sold to local smelting-woiks.’’
* * * *
In pursuance of the B.H. Central’s policy of
making hay while the sun shines, a contract with Dry
Creek for 3000 tons white lead, and a provisional contract
for 3000 tons of sulphides, have been made. These are in
addition to sales to Block 14 and the getting into blast of
the third smelter.
* » * ♦
A great deal of money has been,thrown away at
Broken Hill through the absence of reliable plans and
surveys outside the big mine. Down to, say, three years
ago these things were done in a most slipshod manner,
so that it has been nothing unusual for a manager to un-
expectedly strike an old working, long since mullocked
up, which explored tho v ery ground he was spending
hundreds of pounds in touting. This can be said particu-
larly of the Central and Junction.

perties. The Chinese owners of the Tien Shing mine have
netted a little (or big, who knows?) fortune during the

The spiritualistic syndicate is still boring
patiently for coal at St. Kilda (Melh.). The medium’s
seems that the syndicators have pinned their oracle to a
final promise. The coal is situated at a certain number
of hundred feet lower than they have got to thus far, and
ideas of distance have expanded, and the coal-mine lies
deeper in the ground than his original estimate, but it
they mean to go on boring and believing until they strike

away. Not feeling the man get out of the rope (hey
started to haul him back. Imagine their horror when
they saw' they were hauling up a man by the toes. Oanse:

The fall of the Rosebery Ministry is but
in accordance with omens. The suspicion of
Windsor backstairs intrigue about the choice of
a Premier to succeed Gladstone ; the half-hearted
acquiescence of Harcourt, who had better claims
to the leadership; the open discontent of Labou-
chere and the extreme Radicals—these things
made a bad beginning for the clever leader. He
did not improve upon his beginning. His speeches
bristled with offence. The awkward admission
that the consent of “ the predominant partner”
was necessary to Home Rule offended the
Irish; a later allusion to some of his own
party as illiterates was kpenly resented. The
Nonconformist conscience, which roared as gently
as a sucking - dove at the bidding of the
canting Gladstone, fretted uneasily under the
whip of the horse-racing Rosebery. Foes
gathered ; friends grew lukewarm; the Liberal
majority dwindled. Bye-elections went unplea-
santly against the Govt. —the recent loss of Mid-
Norfolk coming only as a significant climax*,to
previous defeats. Rosebery proved physically
unequal to the strain, and his old enemy, insom-
nia, aggravated his troubles. A dissolution was
delayed, in the hope that things would mend ;
but the rent in Ministerial fortunes became every
day more obvious. The defeat of the Govt, by
seven votes in the discussion on the Army esti-
mates might have been resisted ; but the evil day
could only be postponed. So the Govt, resigned—
a general election follows ; and the Tories will
almost certainly return to office.

Acting-Gov. Madden belongs to a line of

The announcement of the marriage of
Boyd Morehead to Miss Seymour has rather
a, tonished his friends in England, writes The

he sought an alliance not altogether unconnected

A London paper relates
how once, when Prof. Morris
was lecturing on history at
Melb. University, a R.C.
student rose and denied a
statement made by the Pro-

authority a passage in a
book by the Professor’s
brother, a Jesuit, who died
lately in London.
A number of Melb.
persons who for long have
patronised Adam Lindsey
Gordon through the columns
of the daily press, and
whose annual snivel over the
grave of the bard has been
regularly recorded, have
assembled in the City of Bad
Odour for the purpose of
forming a Gordon society,
and fostering an interest in
A. L. G. by giving recitals of
his works. And yet poor
Gordon is interesting, in
spite of the remorseless

Artist- Lionel Cowen,
who leaves Melbourne for
London shortly, has been
fortunate in securing a great
admirer for his work in Mrs.
Silas Harding, Victoria’s
richest widow, who has
bought recently, at substan-
tial figures, several of the
artist’s pictures. Mr. Cowen
married, some years ago, a
remarkably handsome
woman, who has figured in
several of his pictures, and is
the mother of the smallest
infant in Australia. The
child, a boy, is now seven (7)
months old, and measures
only twelve inches, and its
hands and feet are micro-
scopically small. Despite
this, young Cowen, an ob-
ject of great interest to the
medical profession, is per-
■ fectly healthy and thrives
well.
Premier Seddon (M.L.) is to be presented
with a birthday address, and Mrs. Seddon with
1000 sovereigns. Since the enfranchisement of the
Maoriland woman, a Premier’s wife is evidently
a person of large political importance. So far as
The Bulletin knows, this wife-testimonialising
is without precedent in Australasia.
It is surmised {vide last week’s cable) that
“ Pijedatoros ” Robinson will take the temporary

temperature is 30 below zero, and the inhabitants
eat cod-fish seven days a week ?
Of 18 Vic. Premiers, six allowed a
K.O.M.G. to be tied to their tails —O’Shanassy,
Sladen, M'Culloch, Duffy, Berry and Patterson.
The only Vic. Premier with a hereditary title was
O’Loghlen, Bart., hereditary Prince of Burren,
begorra, who, by the way, completes his 67th
year on June 27, though you wouldn’t think so to
look at him.
J. B. Patterson, K.0.M.G., has just got
out from England the star and ribbon of the order
of knighthood to which he now belongs, and has
been wearing the pretty things round his neck at
a lot of recent banquets in the country. The St.
Michael and St. George colors are red-and-blue—
red, the color of meat, and blue, the color of a
butcher’s smock. Rosebery is a humorist.
E. G. Fitz Gibbon, chairman of Melb.
Board of Works, and poet of gutters and sewers,
is a sensitive flower, and squirms like a hooked
worm under criticism. A sample squirm from
the Argus
For forty years and longer towards whom am I a wronger?
I have all that time been living under open public glare,
And am one that straight defies all the prying hundred
eyes
To find out one unworthiness, and freely lay it bare.
How could Ibe unemployed ? Could I not fill up the void
As cleverly as you can, and mould my own career ?
I am no hireling slavish, nor sordid trickster knavish,
And ’tis for those who know to say if I am paid too dear.
They could have bade me clear.
If they had, in quick compliance I’d have trusted self-
reliance,
Without fear.
Fitz. modestly admits his infallibility, and defies
the world to find in him “one unworthiness.”
Probably the White Knight has never heard of
paranoia—the disease that afflicts the man who
“ goes dotty ” from a prolonged survey of his own
perfections. Verse like the above would in some
people be regarded as one of the very worst
symptoms of paranoia.
R. W. Lewis is one of the
most brilliant, popular, and
positively the most unlucky of
Australasian cyclists. If Lewis
rides in a race, and in that race
a man is destined to fall, or to
be “baulked ” or “ pocketed,”
that fated one will be Lewis.
And his hard luck gave him
the hardest knock of all when
he raced Megson not long ago
in the Five Mile Champion-
ship. All the way round
Lewis led Megson ; through-
out the long five miles Lewis
breasted the wind, shielding
Megson; over every inch of
every lap Lewis made the pace
and bore the worry of it; and,
behind him, peddling ding-
dong after his hind wheel, rode
the wily foe, with his iron jaw
set upon the single task of
hanging on to Lewis. Then
in the last 50 yards Megson
“got the go” on Lewis and
beat him on the post by an
eyebrow. Lewis is a Sydney
man, 25 years old, and has
been a cyclist for three years.
Already he has lowered the
Australian mile cycling record
by 6 1-5 secs., his time being
2min. 8 1-5 secs. And the
other day, when he won the
25-Mile Championship of Vic-
toria, he put up a new record
of Ih. 4min. 53secs. as against
the previous best of Ih. 6min.
47 l-ssec. Lewis is also a
grand footballer ; “ the best
three-quarter-back in N.S.
Wales” according to his
strong following of masculine
and feminine admirers.
Journalist: “ Higinbotham is painted as ■
a kind of amiable sumph in his barristerial ref-
lations. Now, he was defending counsel in a
libel action v. my paper, and the style in which
he drilled all hands beforehand showed that he
had his share of the wisdom of the serpent, his
particular injunction being that nobody was to
try and be a good witness, by saying more than
he was asked for.”
J. G. Burtt, who for years represented
North Melbourne in Vic. Assembly, is still to be
seen in Collins-st., setat, say, 85. He once beat
George Higinbotham at an election, and years
afterwards, when Burtt’s seat was in danger and
Higinbotham was in the House, the latter went and
addressed a big and noisy meeting on Burtt’s .be-
half. J.G.B. was a henchman of Father Mathew
50 years ago, and attributes his health and
longevity to “ water straigho.”
A Maoriland pioneer has just died at West
Maitland, where he had resided for 50 years.
John Sawyer, who was 80 when he “went over,”
was one of a surveying-party who went to M.L.
in 1835 on behalf of the N.Z. Company. Many
persons, who did not know deceased, believed him
identical with a man of the same name who
figured in Major Mudie’s “ rebellion ” at Castle
Forbes, just beyond Maitland ; but this could not
be, as Mudie’s trouble occurred in the thirties, and
Mr. Sawyer did not reach the Hunter until 1846.
Clark Arthur Irving, barrister-at-law, and
once a N.S.W. Crown Prosecutor, died in Sydney
last week. He was a native of N.S.W., and one
of the few wits of the Australian Bar, but he
■lacked industry and other things often possessed
by duller conversationalists. Clark Irving was a
college-mate of Lord Rosebery, who was glad to
renew their old acquaintance on his Australian
visit, and will regret to hear of the death of a man
who, in his early manhood, was one of the
brightest and most genial of spirits.
Rev. James Bickford, [the oldest Wes-
leyan minister in S. A., and one of the best-known
members of the denomination in Australia,
died last week. Mr. Bickford, who was
everywhere respected as a good and charitable
man, was born on 6th May, 1816, and went asji
missionary to the West Indies in ’3B. He arrived
in Sydney with the late Dr. Kelynaok and Mr.
Ournow (now editor of S.M. Herald), and has
ever since, until his superannuation a few years
ago, worked hard for the church in Australia, He
had been thrice president of the Australian con-
ference.
“The House of Lords is not a second
Chamber at all, but a permanent party organisa-

Miss Emily Dickenson, the plucky girl
who “ gave a lead ” over the life-line from the
wrecked Wairarapa to the shore, is now the pre-
siding Hebe of a Pitt-st. (Sydney) bar.
Powers, M.P. (Q.), sarcastically says that
he observes Michael Davitt isn’t coming to the
leper-province till Sept., when the Coercion Act
will have expired. As Davitt is a chief victim of
Irish Coercion Acts, Powers thinks he discerrfs
something more than accident here.
A Bulletin correspondent : —There are
only two licensed surveyors in S.A. Survey

One very solemn day, in 1840, there was
just Is. 6d. in the South Australian Treasury.
But the province had no debts in those days. If

Centralian organs want to know why, if
the Northern line be deflected so as to divert
Rockhampton trade to Townsville, the Central
line should not be deflected so as to capture for

According to Dr. Garran, M.L.C. (N.S. W.j,
“ old Jack ” Robertson, although a staunch advo-
cate of land-taxation, adopted the idea that, while
the country had so much land to sell, it was better
first to sell it, and then, after it was sold, to tax
it. This is the identical argument used time and
again by MTlwraith, in Queensland, to justify
land-sales and stave off land-values taxation.
Practically,
the organised
labor of N.S.
Wales and
Queensland has
been federated,
and union labor
in those pro-
vinces can move
as one body.
The next step
in progression is
to secure the ad-
mission into this
federation of the
labor-unions of
Victoria and
S.A. Curious
that, though the
present federa-
tion had its
genesis in a labor
convention held
at Ballarat
(Vic.), the pro-
vinceof Victoria
has not yet come
within the terms
of its native-
born scheme.
In 18 91,
N.S. Wales re-
turned a Protec-
tionist majority
to the Assembly,
and the Free-
traders there-
upon sent huge
petitions to the
Council, de-
manding that it
should override
the will of the
people as ex-
pressed in the
Customs Duties
Bill. The Coun-
cil didn’t take
that advice at
the time, but
stored it away
for future use,
and now uses it by rejecting tbe ifreetrade txo-
vermnent Land and Income Tax Bill. It arro-
gantly overrides the will of the people in 95 just
as Reid and Co. urged it to do in ’9l, and thus
Reid’s political fowl comes home to roost on his
own fence.
Dr. MacLaurin, M.L.C.: “lam not sure
that there is at present a rich man in N.S.W.”
Julian Salomons, Q.C., M.L.C. : “There is one

make a shilling without saving sixpence of it.”
“ Protection was, in Victoria, a synonym
for patriotism ; and so long as certain gentlemen
who supported the importers’ interests sneered at
the efforts of the people to supply their own
wants, so long would Protection be synonymous
with patriotism.”—Higgins, Vic. M.L.A.
The N.S.W. Freetraders are making a
song about the duty of £2 ss. charged to a
Bathurat man on an imported wooden leg pre-
sented to him by public subscription. All The
Bulletin has to say is that it’s a wooden-legged
country that can’t make its own wooden legs.
The Reid (N.S.W.) fiscal system abolishes
all duties save those on spirits, tobacco, and nar-
cotics, and exempts from Income-tax those annu-
ally in receipt of £3OO and under. So that, unless
in Ministerial office, the present crowd of teetotal
M.’sP. would pay absolutely nothing to the
revenue.
S.A. Opposition Leader Downer regards
Premier Reid (N.S.W.) as “ an anti-Federal,” and
Parkes as “theoretically a Federal, but practically
indifferent.” He believes that Reid’s Hobart
Conference of Premiers has “ thrown back Federa-
tion for years by introducing new methods to
cause delay.”
The only members of N.S.W. Leg. Coun-
cil whom neither Henry Parkes nor Dibbs had
any voice in nominating are G. H. Cox, G. Thorn-
ton, J. H. Want, and Dr. Garran. Of the 64
sitting members, Oowper appointed one ; Robert-
son, one; Stuart and Dibbs, eight; Dibbs, 15;
Parkes, 37 ; Reid, two.
Dr. MacLaurin’s impertinent challenge to
the Reid Government to “go to the country”
has never been equalled in N.S.W. politics as an
insolent sample of assumed feudal patronage. Its
only parallel is the supposititious case of the street
gamin, who yells after a bishop—“ Hey, mister
“ Well, my little boy ?” “Pull up yer socks !”
Had N.S.W. Leg. Council been bluntly
honest, the burden of its chant would have been :
“ At present, no matter what we may have said,
or how we may have voted in the past, we will not
have a land-tax of any sort, at any price.’’ When
the tax on land-values was first mooted and no
mention made of exemptions, the Council oozed
with crocodile’s tears for the small allotment-
owner ; when the exemptions were inserted —
“Narrow class taxation,” cried the Council.
If Commissioner Eddy is not coming back
to N. S. Wales, that province might do worse
than secure the services of J. H. Smith, the ex-
Commissioner of S.A. Under his management
the S.A. railways regularly yielded the highest
percentage of profit in Australia. This was partly
owing, no doubt, to the cheapness of the lines, for
each mile of railway has to pay interest on .£7OOO
only, while each mile in N.S.W. has to pay
interest on .£14,000 ; but it was also partly owing
to Smith, who is a brainy 'man and much hated
by the political log-roller.
Dickson, M.L.A. (Q.), is of opinion that
“ women would be better employed looking after
their homes than in exercising the suffrage.”
Exercising the suffrage, in the case of a man, only
means that he has to spend half-an-hour in each
three years voting against people like Dickson.
But, when woman’s suffrage is in question, it is
generally implied that to own a vote makes it

Premier Kingston, addressing the S.A.
Parliament ore rotunda : “ I have notified the
Colonial Office and the Governor-Designate of the
intention to reduce the vice-regal salary, as the
tie between South Australia and the mother
country did not depend on having an aristocrat to
worship or a plutocrat to plunder.” Viscount
Hampden, Baron Dacre (N.S.W.), aristocrat ;
Lord Brassey (Vic.), plutocrat. Nobody can
accuse Premier Kingston of oblique markmanship.
Yet who will envy him the acquisition of pious
Governor Buxton ?
The Maoriland Govt, has a Bill on hand
to largely reduce the number of Local Govern-
ment bodies. The Maorilanders have great faith
in the virtues of local government, but at last they
begin to think that—with Drainage Boards, Har-
bor Boards, River Boards, Road Boards, Town
Boards, School Boards, Hospital and Charitable-
aid Boards, District Boards, County Councils,
Borough Councils, and other Boards, Councils,
Trusts, &e.—a good principle has been much over-
done. Nearly every spot of land is bossed by
four different Boards, and it is proposed to amal-
gamate a lot of these for the sake of economy.
“ A straw shows.” It amuses The Bulle-

light be thrown upon the North Shore mystery—

will, no matter how adroitly and considerately the
Commission’s report may be framed, be an awful
facer for one or two persons in high places. It
would never do to have the Mount Rennie trial
infamy laid bare in the Assembly while the public
wrath was excited over the Dean case, and so
signs are roundaboutly made that the prisoners’
case is at last to be considered.
Four new railways are promised in variou ß
parts of N.S. Wales—subject to Parliamentary
approval, which is practically a foregone conclu-
sion. Meanwhile, that comprehensive Betterment
Act, which was to prevent the systematic looting
of the Treasury by landowners under the pretence
of “compensation,” seems as far oft as ever. Also,
there is no sign of any attempt to build the lines—
which are all comparatively cheap ones—out of
revenue, and the same old loan which blooms in
the spring is to be resorted to as usual. There is
a lot of monotony about the ways of Australian
financiers. The chief reason assigned for the new
railways is that they will supply work for about
800 men, and, in view of this, Mr. Young thinks
the “unemployed difficulty” should cease from
troubling for this year, anyhow. As the Labor
Bureau reports 8000 or 10,000 unemployed in the
county of Cumberland alone, The Bulletin
hereby sets down Mr. Young as a sanguine ass.
Among Premier Reid’s promised saving ß
for the year Ist July, ’95, to Ist July,’96, are £I6OO
from the allowance for assistance to old and sick
aborigines ; <£lso from the allowance for food for
prisoners in lock-ups; .£2BOO from the vote for
medical comforts and food for the insane; £I4OO
from the grant for amusements, &c., for the
insane; <£soo from the grant to the Coast Hos-
pital ; .£IOOO from other hospital grants ; .£590
from the allowance for inquests and medical
attendance in case of any sudden outbreak of
disease; and .£2700 from the allowance for the
maintenance of the sick poor in hospitals. Also,
the vote for the Benevolent Asylum is cut down
by £SOO, and that for the maintenance of deserted
children by <£soo ; .£7O is saved off the “ medical
attendance in minor gaols; <£3oo off the Boys’
Home and Reformatory ; and a number of smaller
savings of the same kind are promised. Alto-
gether, 1896 is going to be a cold year in N.S.W.
for the deserted infant and the pauper lunatic and
the old rheumatic aboriginal.
Major-General Tulloch, late of Victoria,
has been good enough to acquaint Hingland with
the true causes of Melbourne’s bank failures.
“State socialism, and the action of professional
politicians, resulting from payment of members ”
are responsible for Victoria’s busted condi-
tion, according to this bigoted man in buckram.
It is true that the loss on the Government rail-
ways is attributable to the jobbery of a paid Par-
liament. So much may be conceded in Tullooh’s
favor. On the other hand, we have the glaring
fact that the leading railway wire-pullers were
men who would abolish payment of members if
they could, whilst the bank breakers to an odd one
were the then “ wealthy ” politicians to whom a
matter of .£3OO salary was of no importance what-
ever. All the evidence bearing on the connection
between Victorian politics and local financial
disasters goes to show that an unpaid House,
elected on the English system, would probably
have brought the country to much greater grief in
a much shorter time. Can Tullcoh mention one
labor member responsible for a sinful railway line
or a bank swindle?
N.S.W. Fafcman (yesterday): “I do not
think the time opportune for a Local Government
Bill; the country districts have not yet cried out
for the power to tax themselves, and it is the duty
of the State to construct and maintain all the
main roads of the province.” Fatman (to-day):
“ I have always opposed a land-tax as being un-
necessary until at least a thorough system of taxa-
tion under local government was provided.”
The Vic. pension-list continues to swell.
Bowing to a Full Court judgment, Govt, has
decided to pay all pensions calculated upon salaries
with the annual value of quarters and allowances
added. So that where a civil servant was blessed
with a house, wood, water, gas, apd pasturage for
his goat, the yearly value of those perks must be
tacked to his pay, and the pension assessed on the
lump sum. This judgment will cost Vic. about
.£IO,OOO a year.
Minister Best
(Vic.), in his Budget
speech, said he could
not always distinguish
a revenue-tax from a
protective-tax. This is
a relic of the old heresy
that protective taxes
should produce re-
venue. Protection has
no more to do with
Customs revenue than
has Freetrade. Protec-
tion is an effort to
divert trade, Freetrade
is an untaxed trade.
The revenue duties in
Pi'emier Reid’s Budget
are a hindrance to
trades that cannot be
made local —they are to
Protection and Free-
trade what the mule is
to the horse and the
ass.
“The Public and
Private Acts of Vic-
toria, also the Acts of

tion of the Imperial
Statutes apparently in

runs the superscription
of the Consolidated
Acts of Victoria, 1890,
and no one knows what
Imperial Acts are in
force in Vic., as only
lately acts of Charles
11., Henry 11., and
others have been
brought into action.

Grimes, Queensland M.P., held a meeting
recently at Ipswich, and “ severely criticised the
Labor-party, which he accused of disloyalty

pressing dissent by hooting and pounding with
its feet. Finally Grimes recited the Anthem
all by himself, and gave three cheers for Her
Gracious. It would be interesting to know if
Grimes’ loyalty ever led him to sacrifice anything,
even two coppers, for his beloved Queen, or if he
ever got his feet wet on her behalf, or helped her
in any way. Supposing the Queen should be
dethroned by a revolution, and she asked Grimes
to take up arms on her behalf and go on long night
marches with a rifle on his shoulder—what would
be the exact value of Grimes in such a contingency
as that ?
Mr. Arthur Griffith, M.L.A. (N.S.W.)
writes as follows : —
Dear Bulletin, —You say “ the fiscal attitude of the
N.S.W. Labor-party is incomprehensible.” As a matter
of fact, the N.S.W. Labor-party hasn’t got a “fiscal
attitude ” at all, and was elected on the distinct under-
standing that it would not assume one. It wants a land-
tax, a State bank, and several other things, and will not
support any Govt. (Freetrade or Protectionist) that will
not give them. It is swallowing the “ tariff reform ” of the
present Govt, for the sake of the Land-tax.
To which The Bulletin responds that, whether
it will or not, the N.S.W. Labor-party has a fiscal
attitude. It assumed a Protectionist fiscal attitude
in return for manhood suffrage; it now assumes
a Freetrade attitude in consideration of getting
a Land-tax. Its position in these matters is per-
fectly honest—but, so long as it votes on fiscal
questions, no matter which way it votes, or why it
votes that way or any other way, it has a fiscal
attitude. The N.S.W. Labor-party has never
“sunk the fiscal issue,” for the sufficient reason
that any such sinking was wholly impossible. It
assumes its fiscal attitude from reasons of its own,
and the other parties also assume their attitude
from reasons of their own. They are a different
set of reasons, but the attitude is all there.
With the beginning of the really cold
weather in Melbourne it is strange to see the lead-
ing drapery houses sacrificing their winter goods
to make room for an early show of Spring fashions.
Such is the case, however ; and it is marvellous
this winter to note the extreme manner in which
the prices of articles which one would have
thought would just be in the greatest demand —
such as furs, sealskin jackets, winter mantles,
dress stuffs, &c. —are reduced at Messrs. Hicks,
Atkinson & Sons’ establishment in Collins-street,
during their existing stock-taking sale.
AUSTRALIA, A.D.?
Out of the mist she springs—
The mist of Time so long around her ;
No blood upon her garment clings,
No war has crowned her.
She is not born of strife—
No mothers mourn ; to seal her birth
No martyr yielded up his life ;
But joy and mirth
Her sponsors are ; and Peace
And Plenty, too, are there to clasp her hands,
As on the threshold of her life
The New Republic stands.

MTTOGEE, Friday.—An old man. who loada
a hermit's life near Goodanan, has created
come sensation by the exhibition of a number
of very rich specimens of quartz, which he
- asserts he has taken from a reef recently dia-

j ceived as a “ fairy tale,” but as it was snbso-
i quently authenticated by a number of repu-
I table men, who had seen the specimens and
I questioned the hermit concerning them, there
■ can bo no doubt as to its genuineness.
Nothing, however, will tempt the woodsman
to divulge the whereabouts of the reef, nor

South Australia maintains its reputation.
Recently the Adelaide Register’s London corres-
pondent gravely informed a wondering province
that Governor-designate Buxton had offered up
“a magnificent extempore prayer” at an Exeter
Hall gathering. This month Lieut.-Gov. Way
left Adelaide for the express purpose of presiding
at a Melb. Methodist Union meeting.
* » ♦
Parson-editor Fitchett, speaking at thebig
Melbourne Methodist meeting last week, could
not leave out the Wesleyan “King Charles’s
Head ” —“ the unspeakable Papist,” to wit. And
thence was evolved a somewhat entertaining situa-
tion. Referring to the Pope’s message of re-union,
he said : “ Before we can obey the Pope’s call and
return to his fold, how many things we know to
be true must we believe to be lies, and how
many things we believe to be lies must we
have to take to be true ?” Acting-Gov. Madden,
who had been inveigled to the gathering, visibly
squirmed, and when it came to his turn to make a
few remarks, he quietly said, “ I am not a
Methodist, and the lies which appal Mr. Fitchett
are the truths which sustain me.” And then the
maladroit Fitchett squirmed, while the assem-
bled Methodists shuddered at the discovery—new
to most, as Madden, C.J., keeps his religion
qujet—that an unholy Roman Catholic had been
allowed to jump the billet of Chief Justice and
Acting-Governor.
• • *
Melbournian : “ Why should Chief Justice
Madden be hauled into the Methodist Union
meeting? This is where the religionists make
their big mistake in kootooing to rank and posi-
tion, ever hanging on to the skirts of the rich,
who, of course, need no salvation, while the poor
ber-ruther is damned if he goes to the Caulfield
races programmed this week for excellent
Madden.”

The unworldly of Sydney were absolutely
astonished last week, when city Mayor Lees, a
boss teetotaller and Sunday-school superintendent,
invited the Gaiety Girls to the Town Hall, where
he provided them with music and champagne.
After all, saints are but mortal. Had Mayor
Lees not been born into Sunday-school circles he
would have made a more than passable johnny.

AROMATIC EVOLUTION.
SMITH (just from Hingland, superciliously) : “ The dominant odor of Sydney society is, I
notice, whisky and opoponax .”
JONES: “ Yes, but that’s better than what it used to be —brandy and patchouli.”
THE OLD ’UN : “Ah, the country was never so prosperous as in the good old days, when
it used to be rum-and-onions.”
A petition to have the local postmistress
removed was set afoot in a Sydney suburb, and a
paid canvasser employed by the promoters to
obtain signatures. He conceived the idea of
attending the busy trams leaving that suburb for
the city at certain hours each morning, and
returning suburbanwards at certain hours each
evening. The other morning, the tram-goers
were suddenly cheered by the sight of a scuffle
between two men—a knock-down blow and a
rending of manuscript; a fierce rejoinder ; acatch-
as-catch can and a roll under-and-over all around
the footpath ; clinch ; clear-away ; pm ; bang ;
stouch —and away moved the locomotive. ihe
canvasser had presented the petition to the lady s

It was pretty cool on the part of the secre-
tary of Hobart Art Gallery to write to the agent
for the winner of the first prize in the V.D.L.
lottery, asking him if he felt inclined to present a
work of art to the institution. The reason for
this appears to be that certain Tasmanians had
announced (!) their intention of giving such a
memento if they were fortunate enough to secure
first prize!

A Collins-street (Melb.) shopkeeper for
some time past has been showing in his shop-
window a number of cabinet photos, taken by a
new process. The collection failed to attract much
attention until a brilliant idea struck the exhibi-
tor, who added a photo, of a woman in the act of
putting on her petticoat. Now, there is a Gaiety
crush in front of that shop.

The experienced theatrical manager who,
in advance, described Blanche Massey as, perhaps,
the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, has
somewhat puzzled his friends now that they have
seen the dreadfully cold and inanimate Miss
Massey aforesaid, for nobody ever suspected that
manager of admiring nun-like icy beauty—and it
is generally not hard to judge the direction in
which a man’s tastes go. For instance, now that
people have seen several of Julian Salomons’
woman-pictures, on loan in the galleries, they
have made up their minds that the energetic little
Q.O. dreams of the sort of ladies you see on
chocolate-boxes.

Barcaldine (Q.) lately had a matrimonial
sensation. At a very largely-attended wedding,
the bridegroom astounded those present by reply-
ing to the parson’s question, “Will you have
this woman?” “ I will not.” Then, putting on
his castor, he hastily left the church. Which
recalls a Vic. incident where the lady was
the objector. “Will you take this man,” &0.,
benignly asked the parson. “I will not,” sturdily
answered the lady. “Then what brought you
here?’’ enquired the astonished shepherd. “ Just
to tell him* so,” answered the fair one, turning on
her heel and leaving the church.

The cheek and the “English” of the
Westralian Forrests is alike appalling. Alec
Forrest, Mayor of Perth, lately wrote thus to
Chief Justice Onslow, a recently-decorated fellow-
official ; “It affords me extreme pleasure, indeed,
in conveying to you the hearty approval of this
corporation of the honor recently conferred upon
you by Her Gracious Majesty in recognition of
your lengthy and distinguished career, &c., &c.

Judge Hood (Vic.) announces a series of

lecture, told a Melb. audience: “Those who keep

Coroner Youl’s verdict—“ Saturday-night
suffocation,” should be referred to Judge Win-
deyer for report.
Salomons, Q.C., in addressing the Dean
Commission, was very severe upon popular opinion,
citing the case of Archer as an example of its
fallibility. But the learned Q.C. carefully disre-
garded the fact that it was not mere belief in
Dean’s innocence that caused the clamor for a
Commission. The question of Dean’s innocence
was, and is, in fact, quite beside the question.
Popular opinion, in this case, is founded upon
something tangible. It is founded upon the
knowledge that Dean did not get a fair trial : that
the Judge made himself appear unduly anxious
for a conviction : that he first bullied and then
cajoled the jury : and, finally, that the jurors,
through weariness and the railings of an impatient
Judge, were prevented from giving their own
proper consideration to a matter which it was for
them, and for them only, to decide.

The Dean Commission was not appointed
to try anybody, but simply to find out, by careful
inquiry, whether the Crown hadn’t made a hor-
rible botch of the administration of justice in this
particular case. The Crown had to appoint this
Commission to inquire into itself, because it
became apparent to everybody that it had botched
things badly, and it became necessary, in order to
preserve any semblance of fairness, to make an
investigation and find out whether the botch was
only as bad as it seemed, or a great deal worse.
Under these circumstances, the Crown, seeing
that it is investigating its own blunders, ought, as
indicated by Mr. Chanter, M.P., to pay all costs.
It can’t conduct a fair and impartial inquiry into
its own injustice and stupidity while it pays a
brilliant lawyer 50 guineas a day to prove one side
of the case, and leaves the other side to be sup-
ported by private charity.
» # #
A performance was given at Sydney Royal
last week in aid of the Dean defence fund, and
S.M. Herald makes a remark thereon in a sur-
prised tone :
One feature of the entertainment that must have
forced itself upon the thinking portion of the audience
was the well-to-do air of the people that filled the house ;
and this, it may be added, showed that the Dean defence
movement is not confined to the class of people who
would be regarded as the immediate associates of Dean.
The Herald, which is snobbish to its inmost soul,
evidently has hard-and-fast ideas as to the sort of
people that a man like Dean ought to associate
with. And as the people who filled the Royal
appeared to be “ well-to-do,” it assumes that they
couldn’t be regarded as Dean's associates. There-
fore, it notes, with a certain lingering surprise,
that they, though of an altogether different class,
actually sympathised with a man belonging to the
“ lowah ordahs,” whereas they might have been
expected to let him hang with absolute indiffer-
ence. The Herald’s feelings on this point are
suggestive of the wild astonishment of that other
elderly female who found that Wales ate straw-
berries just the same way as any other man.
• * •
It cannot be seriously contended that
fortune-telling is a result of secular education, as
attempted by Salomons, Q.C., in his special
pleading for the Crown before the Dean Commis-
sion. Secular education is a besom that sweeps
into the dustbin of past absurdities all such
absurdities as astrology, divination, fortune-tell-
ing, witchcraft, &c., &c. Religious education—
that is to say, in the accepted sense of “ religion,”
positively encourages fortune-telling. The Bible
reeks with instances of persons who ‘‘ enquired of
the Lord ” as to their coming fortune in this event
or that. Besides, in the case of Mrs. Dean, did
not Mr. Salomons himself bring forward a person
to prove that she had been a Sunday-scholar ?
* * *
A Melbourne parson remarks that it is “a
solemn mockery to keep the Bible out of State
schools, and afterwards, when the boys and girls
get into prison, give it to them in their cells. ”
Score one to the reverend gentleman. The Bible
ought not to be thrust on prisoners. For instruc-
tion in plain moral philosophy, which is what
criminals chiefly require, the Bible is a useless, or
worse than useless, volume. But what good might
not a chosen secular worK accomplish ! A book
of eloquent essays upon the practical virtues of
charity, honesty, industry, study in literature and
art, self-control, temperance in all things, and
healthy recreation. Imagine such a work, in place
of the ramshackle, contradictory, dry, historical,
mythical, hysterical, frequently indecent, and
utterly humorless Word ! Imagine a parson
preaching from the new Scriptures: “ Deah
friends, on page 302 you will find that Lord Bacon
saith of knowledge that ‘it taketh away vain ad-
miration of anything, which is the root of all
weakness.’ ” A beautiful text for those members
of the congregation who might be addicted to
booking their theatre-seats right next to the
Governor’s box.

A movement for the Deepening of Spiri-

“Melb. Y.M.C.A.,” writes a Bulletin
correspondent, “has developed a new religioi 3
horror in the shape of secret meetings. At one of
these there were present about 150 young men.
The lights having been turned low (though there
were no sisters present), ‘We will now engage in
silent prayer,’ said the chairman, and instantly
there was a loud thump as 300 kneecaps struck
the floor. Soon, however, the solemn silence was
completely ‘ bust ’ by some barbarous unbeliever
yelling out, ‘ Damn you, don’t pinch me ! ’ A
responsive giggle caused thechairman to turn on the
lights, and there was a hurried demand to throw
the curser out. He went out quick, but not till
he had somewhat mangled the four hysterical
pleaders who had given him away. Then followed
the reading of letters from absent brothers. They
were chock-full of Scripture and remarks to the
effect that the writers’ souls were saved—halle-
lujah ! Again the lights went down, and the
dusky pantomime loomed up in earnest. In
quick succession young men rose to beseech the
crowd to pray for erring sisters and mothers ; also
for their beery fathers, thieving brothers, and
crooked friends. The lights again, a hymn, and
then they poured out into the street. When
details of the follies of girls, parents, and friends
are bandied, it is no wonder that these ‘ secret ’
meetings are popular with the alleged virtuous
young man.” #

the assumption that non-Anglican Protestants are

Auckland, M.L., has had a sensation. A
post-office inspector had died suddenly, and a
post-mortem examination of him followed. Dur-
ing the course of this, the coroner, Dr. Philson,
ordered the dead man’s heart to be brought into
the jury-room because “ it would, be an interesting
sight for them to see.” This is regarded as a
shocking and outrageous thing by Maoriland

heart and held it up before the anatomy-class.

E/D.Ji :Tfc is more than time that medical
charges, were kept within reasonable bounds. The
• rapacitybf physiciansand surgeonsgrows with their
incomes in too many cases ; high fees- mean high
living, and high living entails a .tendency to haste
and carelesshessin professional work. If medical
; men became mqre valuable to humanity as their
. costliness increased;—if the enlargement of their
household expenditure improved the prospects of
their patients, these fashionable extortioners
would' sfeein entitled to all they can get. The
truth of the matter is just the other way round.
- The ruling passion with the average successful
' practitioner is to cut a dash before the world,
which is very bad for the healing art and the
, public pocket. There are exceptions, of course,
but not many. A leech, or sawbones, is seldom
found achieving much celebrity without the
assistance of an arrogant brass plate, a formidable
staff of servants, and'other vain display. Fools
encourage these things, but that is no reason why
the law, being framed considerably for the protec-
tion of fools, shouldn’t safeguard them against
if. their medical adviser.
E.F. : “ Hospital nurses are prompted to
give extra sympathetic attention to the most
wretched patients by their womanly indignation
at the distinction which the male medical staff
makes in favor of the well-to do. The heart of the
hospital nurse beats in the lady doctor, let us re-
member. Twenty years hence there will be no
men doctors in poor neighborhoods, no “ provi-
dent dispensary ” or lodge practice left for them.
The working classes will by that time have dis-
covered that a duly-qualified woman is likely to
give them a lob more consideration in the back
room, or out of it, than her brother ever gave
for the money.” Perhaps. The Bulletin has
noticed that the nice naval officer gets at least as
much attention from the hospital nurses as the
coarse-handed, shattered laborer.

The libel-action of Allison Smith v. The
Age has already maundered along for three weeks
in the Melbourne first Civil Court, but the
surrounding world pays no heed to it. Chief-
Justice Madden and a jury of six are listening to
the dull echo of this bygone railway rumpus, and
Smith is conducting his own case. People about
the court remark that the ex-Locomotive Super-
intendent doesn’t shine as a cross-examiner. Else-
where nothing in connection with the case is re-
marked at all. Victoria was weary of Allison
Smith and his strained relations with engine-
drivers, greasers, &0., long before he left the service,
and for years past the sight of his name in a news-
paper has warned readers to pass on to the next
subject. If this dreadful libel-suit were to sud-

public wouldn’t miss it. Either Allison Smith or
David Syme deserves sympathy in the matter, yet
nobody cares whether Smith is a persecuted man
or Syme (who pays costs, anyway) is a badly-
treated newspaper proprietor. There never was
another long libel-action that attracted so little
attention as this, or caused such an awful waste of
printer’s ink. The interminable story of Speight
is a rollicking comic-opera by comparison.

The yellow men reckoned that this was their first
half-crown, so they all attended again next Sun-

money in the case, and that they had been sold,
they rushed home and jumped upon their Bibles.

Hygiene teaches that nothing is so bene-
ficial to the human constitution as thorough
cleanliness, a theory verified by modern revela-
tions of the deadly microbes which infest the
flesh and blood—especially if we do not keep
ourselves in a clean condition, which ought to be
the first aim of every individual with any esteem
for himself. The use of Amykos has proved to be
very important to this end, by its great sanitary
power over the skin, mouth, teeth, &c. If you
value yourself, never be without this excellent pre-
paration.

846 Maequarie-atreet North, Sydney,
June 25, 1895.
My Dear Moobabxnda—
The only, freezing circumstance I remarked in
the appointment of Viscount Hampden to the
Cornstalkian Governorship was that such an
“ominous silence ” re Lady H.’s qualifications
was observed in the newspaper details. As a
rule, we are eagerly assured from the very start
that Lady Blank is an amiable and delightful
personage, but this conventional marmalade was
conspicuously lacking in the first burst of Hamp-
den statistics. However, as Lord Hampden (who
has been twice married) is now the proud possessor
of a Duke’s grand-daughter, it is quite safe to take
all the usual compliments for granted, and Potts
Point may congratulate itself on the main issue
without regard to personal peculiarities. Sydney
society will stand a lot of one-fingered hand-shak-
ing and “indisposition ” if it may talk about what
“ the Duke of Devonshire’s grand-daughter said
to me the other di.”
The Viscount is decidedly a family man. Of
his five sons, the eldest, the hon. “Tom ” Brand,
is a lieutenant in the 10th Hussars, which are
Tummy’s very own warriors, I believe. In
between him and Geoffrey, set. 10, are Hubert—a
naval lieutenant on board the Orescent—Robert
and Roger (beardless youths of 17 and 15);
Margaret, who is 25, Alice (20), and Dorothy (18)
—ladies whose family dates back to “the con-
quest.” Solemnly regarding the Viscount as he
roosts among the branches of his spreading family-
tree, it really looks as if, in him, N.S. W. is about
to hold the long-distance pedigree record for Aus-
tralia —now that Carbine has left the country.
I have a vague feeling that Gov. Hampden will
be a success, and really there was never in this
world a softer vice-regal “snap ” than to follow
in the foot-prints of poor Governor Duff. His
late Excellency has left no giddy heights of suc-
cess to be scaled by his successor—no memories of
prodigal social entertainments to be lived up to by
the new-comer. Even a moderately genial, soci-
able and tactful society man should be able to
take Potts Point by storm.
Talking about Governors reminds me that it
isn’t a case of out-of-sight-out-of-mind with all of
them when they doff the cocked-hat of office and
go back ’Ome again. A young lady who got
married at Parramatta six months, or so, ago was
gratified to receive a letter from Lord Jersey, who
had read the notice of the wedding and hastened
to congratulate her 1 This sounds more like Car-
ington than Jersey. And, apropos of the former,
a well-known ’Stralian actress relates that when
she called upon the baron at ’Omeshe was received
by him in the library, which was pervaded by a
cockatoo using the most unparliamentary language
at the top of its voice. “I hope you don’t mind
him, do you?” said the ex-vice-royalty, who was
basking in the bird’s profanity, “ I rather like it.”
No wonder the Oaringtons put off a party upon
the demise of a certain N.S.W. politician of free-
and-easy speech.
“The Buttercup Spinsters” gave a most suc-
cessful ball at Need’s rooms on 18th inst. The
decorations were most artistic, and the happy idea
of having the time for each dance printed on the
programme, so that one could fit in one’s dance
with one’s hour of departure with the greatest
nicety, is a novelty I sincerely hope to meet again
during the hop season. Buttercup color was, of
course, predominant in the supper decorations,
and Mr. Hardy’s music was right up to date.
Add to all these ingredients a crowd of well-
dressed “ dancing girls,” and it can be easily
understood that the masculine interest was as two
to one, and that the wall-flowers of at least that
evening wore dress-coats, ■ •
Some of the frocks were very neat. Miss Nellie
Baass (one of the hon. secs.) wore a well-cut pink
silk and a pouch-front bodice of pale-
blue and pink brocade with a mock fastening of
diamond studs—an exceedingly stylish gown.
Miss Ella Sparke (her coadjutress) was in pale-
blue corded silk dandified i with gold passemen-
terie, and Miss Sparks wore pink silk with white
lace at all points. A very pretty dark girl wore
white brocade with success, but a short lady in
white silk with big puff ball-sleeves (which did
not efface the nocturnal impression, for sleeping-
suits are cut very saucy just now) seemed to be out
taking the edge off her new robe de nuit.
I have it from a fatally fascinating youth, who
suffers greatly from a rush of pink notes to his
daily mail, that what is called “the Carpet-Pin
Club” has been started in Sydney and, I suppose,
Melbourne too. Its rules and regulations are
mostly unwritten, but its badge is a carpet-pin
worn in a conspicuous position. Girls and boys
(using the word in a “ Gaiety Girl ” sense) are on
the club-lists, and the idea is that when a girl
with a carpet-pin prominently displayed meets a
youth with a similar adornment she and he may
strike up acquaintance and flirt without let or
hindrance even into the jaws of the Divorce
Court. The Carpet-Pin Club is merely an un-
licensed institution for the encouragement of
wholesale flirtation and the only formality in-
separable from joining its mysterious ranks is the
purchase of the pin.
The Dacres got a hearty reception at Sydney
Her Majesty’s last Saturday in that amusing,
smartly-written comedy, “A Scrap of Paper.”
As it was a wet, drizzling sort of evening, there
wasn’t much display in the d.c., where the only
remarkable thing was the extraordinary coiffure
of a lady whose conspicuous locks were arranged
in what an anatomist would call the bowel-twist.
But I liked Mrs. Dacre’s coiffure a la Parisienne,
set off in the first and second acts by a Boulevard
hat trimmed with vivid magenta and green, and
the frock of pale-bluish brocade with small pink
flowers and up-to-date garnitures of magenta
velvet and tinted lace. By the way, seeing how
Mrs. D.’s dresses stood out at the back (and so
do Maud Hobson’s in the “Gaiety Girl”), the
rumor which comes from Melbourne re crinoline
steels in the backs of the smartest frocks would
seem to be true, though in Sydney I only hear of
things like fencing-masks worn on the upper arm
to keep the big, bull-frog-shaped sleeves from col-
lapsing. Apropos, I am sure Maud Hobson must
wear the sleeve-improver, or else a mere hen-like
perk and flutter would never be enough to set her
to rights after Monkhouse has been hugging her
to the visible squashing of her abnormally-big
sleeves. Memo. : Leg-o’-beef-sleeved women who
anticipate being hugged should certainly buy the
improver. And as they know not the day nor the
hour, they should buy it, anyhow.
All this en parenthhse. In the first act Miss
Knights, with her hair becomingly dressed, wore a
graceful gown of pale grey with white points and
a bunch of violets, but I had no patience with
Miss Claudius’s dreadful black riding-habit. In
a day when every well-regulated equestrienne
goes a-gee-gee in a coat, vest, and dickey, the
appearance of a horsewoman in a flowing, bunchy
garment, such as Queen Victoria used to wear in her
horsey salad days, sent the comedy back nearly a
century. It’s an odd thing that nearly every
actress is weak where riding is concerned. I have
seen a good many stage riding-habits, but the only
complete turn-out I ever saw behind the footlights
was worn by a Sydney society woman in a purely
amateur show.
Another thing I objected to in the comedy was
the way Agnes Knights threw the contents of the
Colonel’s writing-table about, in the second act,
while hunting for the scrap of paper. It is not
true to feminine nature for a woman to be so un-
tidy. I don’t say she wouldn’t fling things to the
four winds in a search, but it’s only one woman m
a hundred who wouldn’t carefully put everything
back afterwards. Disorder is immoral —hence
women, who are necessarily more moral than men,
are orderly and neat. Also, the effect of disorder
betrays an upsetting cause, and hypocritical
women always covers up her traces whenever she
can. The last act of the amusing comedy is
smartly dressed by Mrs. Dacre in salmon-pink
brocade, with gold embroideries and pink chiffon;
and Miss Agnes Knights was effective in saffron-
color brocade, with tea-colored lace and a heap of
crimson roses and leaves on the bodice. Mr.
Dacre made an airy, dashing Colonel, and the
mounting was excellent, the Museum-scene being
as full of genuine curios as the Women’s Loan
Exhibition.
On dit that a split is imminent in an Australian
ladies’ club (not to be too precise) over the ques-
tion of the new President. A titled lady
has been absolutely hauled to the position and
given a welcoming tea-party to sign and seal her
Pickwickian appointment; still, as only 25 out of
nearly a hundred members subscribed to the
razzle-dazzle, and as the others stood out in token
of their disapproval of the committee’s action in
foisting a new president on them without asking
their opinion—l really don’t think that welcom-
ing feat can be regarded seriously. The titled
lady in question is not a bit popular with the com-
pact majority of clubsteresses, and unless the
committee make hay of the rules and reg’lations,
and elect her without the usual formality of a poll,
it is more than probable that the ballot-box will
show that the members decline to have even Lady
Blank rammed down their throats in the presiden-
tial capacity. So there, now !
Nellie Stewart’s generous action in handing
over the proceeds of her ben. (.£200) to the poor
little children of Sydney seems to have given a
fillip to infant philanthropy in these parts, for I
see that a Parramatta lady has made a good sug-
gestion to aid the destitute youngsters. One
hundred women are to be buttonholed to subscribe
one shilling per month, and each one so subscrib-
ing is to induce ten others to do so, too. By this
means a goodly sum ought to be got together.
The scheme also embraces an exhibition of
children’s dancing on 17th prox., to be under the
patronage of the acting-vice-royalties. Apropos
of charities, the Woman’s Voice printed this par.
in a recent issue ; “ More than enough to buy food
for a week for a family paid for one seat for one
evening to see the ‘Gaiety Girl,’ while hundreds
of our fellow-women cannot get enough to buy a
meal.” This is all very well, but man does not
live by bread alone. The world must still have its
cakes and ale. The amusement afforded by the
Gee-Gees, a hard-working lot of people, recollect,
does something towards recuperating their
patrons’ energies for the daily struggle. And if
actors and actresses do not live in an atmosphere
of large sums of money, still they are a genuinely
benevolent tribe —as witness the initial lines of this
present paragraph.
Which reminds me that the attendance at the
first Gaiety matinee, at Sydney Lyceum, was
affected by the George Dean defence-fund matinee,
at Sydney Royal, but the play, or whatever-you-
like-to-eall-it, went merrily enough. Blanche
Massey’s love-scenes with “Sharley ” were touched
lightly, and Ryley cut his songs, but considering
the reduced prices nobody expected the complete
night-bill. The gowning was the same, which is
all the matinee woman stipulates for, and except
that Blanche Massey wore a dark-blue dress, with
a bunch of blue flowers, in the last act, which was
infinitely more sensible than the white frock,
there was really no difference in the togging—
though, now I think of it, Maud Hobson wore a
new hat in the first scene. Daylight reveals that
Maud’s gorgeous satin robes have been sat upon
more than once, but otherwise all is well.
Seriously regarded—the only thing I hate in a
“ Gaiety Girl ” is the persistent way they peg at
the fact that “society” shudders at the mere
mention of a burlesque actress as a friend for its
daughter—culminating in Decima Moore recon-
ciling, on the kiss-and-be-friends principle, Gaiety
gal with society belle and vice-versa in a ridicu-
lous denouement. Florence Lloyd hurls rage and
defiance at society with enough realistic bitter-
ness to make the dress-circle bristle with annoy-
ance, or else smile complacently to think that the
burlesque actress feels so very strongly about it
all. I really fail to see why the vexed ques-
tion re the social status of the lady who wears
tights should be so suddenly and desperately dealt
with. The sparkling “Gaiety Girl” plays with no
mission to reconcile the stage and society, I hope.
If she does, it’s foredoomed to failure, for the mis.
sionesses are far too pretty to make any femal e
converts. A knock-kneed, hollow-eyed band, with
no powder on their noses and flat cheeks, are tha
only beings who might effect something.
But it takes more than one pretty girl fiercely
declaiming in an abbreviated bathing-suit to
undermine the inherent snobbishness of human
nature. Re Gov. Hampden’s appointment, a
Sydney evening newspaper remarked that, “in
pedigree, as is befitting for the Governor of the
senior province, Lord Hampden can give Lord
Brassey points.” Perhaps so—but in point of
celebrity and known ability, Victoria’s Gov. is a
very large stack of potatoes compared with the
incoming N.S.W. Gov., who is by no means rich,
either. Gov. Brassey, even if he did hot possess
a fortune of several solid millions, would probably
have made a name or a noise In the world, being
a man with some brains and solid Hing'ish
character. N.S.W.’s brand-new Brahmin is
descended roundaboutly from John Hampden,
who was the friend of Parkes 200 or 300 years
ago; but he isn’t in any way a distinguished man.
As someone remarked, “ So far as we know he is
only ‘a village Hampden.’” However, all that
doesn’t matter a row of pins—the question is:
“Will he give nice tea-parties, and plenty of
them ?”
As feminine garb becomes more mannish, mas-
culine raiment, it would seem, grows “prettier,”
more elaborate, and more milliner-made. Witness
the rustling silk-lined coats, the evidently tongs-
curled hair, and the elaborate cravats of to-day.
A further step in the direction of girlish triviality
in male attire has been made by Aubrey Beards-
ley who, in his newest photographs, wears a Soft,
full shirt-front of fine lawn, and, in place of the
stiff collar of commerce, a point lace This
style, it is said, is catching on in “artistic circles,”
and it is only a question of time till it reaches
Johnnie, Chappie & Co.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
The news of the death of Mr. J. A. Scarr, the
well-known A.J.O. handioapoer, though not unexpected,
has been received with much regret by his numerous
friends in England, writes The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent. Mr. Scarr was first prompted to take up the
subject of handicapping by his association with the late
Mr. W. M'Evilly, who was N.S.W. Parliamentary
Librarian, and raced, as some people still remember,
under the name of “ Mr. O’Malley." It is curious to re-
member what N.S.W. Government officials could do in
those days. M'Evilly was allowed to keep his race-horses
at the Parliament stables, and they were attended to by
members of the staff of attendants, of whom the well-
known Riley was his principal henchman. Every day one
could find either in poor Soarr’s, or J. J. Calvert’s, room,
a gathering of Government officials who talked racing by
the hour. It was then that Scarr began to practise the
art (for art it is) which he afterwards so much adorned. In
those days hon. members liked to have a flutter themselves,
and none of M'Evilly’shorses ever went to the post without
carrying heaps of their money, for they knew he would
give them a good run. How things are altered 1 What
chance would the present librarian have of being able to
train a Yattendon at, practically, the public expense?
But there were no Cricks in those days, and, if
there had been, means would have been found to keep
them quiet. But, all the same, one cannot but wonder
how the little thing was allowed to go on. It must be re-
membered, though, that Mr. Lackey (as he then was) was
an influential member of the Assembly, and combined
parliamentary duties with handicapping, whilst Speaker
Arnold was a thorough “ sport.”
* * * *
Mr. Oook, by reason of the 9st. 31b. allotted,
will doubtless soon put the pen through The Harvester’s
name in Melb. Cup. In the Admiral (9st.), however, may
be found a substitute. This horse’s good performance in
the mud with 9st. 11b. in Glenloth’s year, and his alter
second in Sydney Cup with 9st. 91b. must not be forgot-
ten. In the last Doncaster Handicap The Admiral showed
that he had not lost his speed.
m ♦ ♦ *
The four-year-old, Dreamland, was not run of!
his legs as either a two or a three-year-old, and Ballarat
folk declare he will win one of the Cups. Melb. Cup will,
in all probability, be his journey, and with Bst. 41b. he is
well treated.
* ♦ » *
N.S.W. should play a strong hand in the two
Cups. Solanum, Mahee, Nobleman, Vanitas, Division,
and The Captain have all been given chances in the
Caulfield Cup ; fit and well at the post, Nobleman, with
7st 111 b. only on his four-year-old back, should be for-
midable. In Melb. Cup, Delaware, Mahee, True Blue,
Coolalta, and Rhonda look “ all right ’’ on paper.
» • * •
Mao.’s withdrawal from the G.N. Hurdle-race
is the greatest shock yet received by double-event
backers. _ '
♦ ♦ * *
Daimio and Dundee, so far, rank as the favorite
Melb public G.N. double. Over this pair the shilling
"double” books stand to be hit for £lOOO, and the
diamond blazers have something like £lO,OOO written
against them at an average of 1000 to 10.
The top horse in M.L., both over small timber,
cross country, and in flat handicaps, in which he is gener-
ally top weight, is Liberator, who last year won the Wan-
ganui and Dunedin cups, and this year the N.Z. Grand
National Hurdles, Great Northern G.N. Hurdles, and
G.N. Steeple. -
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
One of the possibilities of this year’s G.N.
Steeple is Romsdal, a big black belonging to Miller Bros.
He is a maiden, but as Millers bred him, and he Is now a
five-year-old, he is evidently being reserved for some-
thing. Wonderful tales of his jumping and galloping
abilities are afloat.

The feeling strengthens that the Totalisator
Bill may, after all, pass Yio. Assembly this session.

PROSPECTUS
OF THE
Manly Co-Operative Steam Ferry
Company, Limited.
Registered under the Companies Act, whereby the
liability of a shareholder is limited to the amount
of his shares.
Capital (authorised), £20,000, in 20,000
shares of £1 each.
Capital (paid-up), £1665, on 1666 shares.
Directors:
JOHN A. PATTERSON, Esq., Chairman.
S. C. SADLER, Esq.
JOSEPH GERMAN, Esq.
W. SMART, Esq.
G. L. RICHARDSON, Esq.
Bankers:
THE LONDON BANK OF AUSTRALIA,

Secretary:
W. G. GERMAN.
The Manly Co-operative Steam Ferry Company
having been established 18 months, and proved to
be a paying concern, now invites applications for i
15,000 contributing shares, in order to procure |
steamers thoroughly suitable for the Manly ferry
traffic—superior to anything yet in the port, with
increased speed and accommodation—so as to cope
with the rapidly developing business of the com-
pany. . I
The Directors are convinced that, by placing
superior steamers upon the line, even greater sue- |
cess will be achieved, whilst a large proportion of
the money now being expended for charter of i
vessels will be saved; this, alone, providing a
handsome return upon the capital invested.
Arrangements have been concluded by which
the Minister for Lands has consented to enlarge
the present wharf accommodation at Manly, thus
providing suitable wharfage for this company.
The assets of the company, consisting of cash
and properties, on the 30th April, amounted to —
after writing off £683 11s. sd. for preliminary
formation expenses and depreciation of properties,
and allowing for outstanding liabilities—£2727
10s. Bd., the paid-up capital being £1665 only ; a
dividend has been declared at the rate of 10 per
cent, per annum, and a bonus of £5O to the em-
ployees, while £929 ss. Bd. has been carried for-
ward to the credit of profit and loss new account,
which new shareholders will reap the advantage
of.
The Co-operative Company has the active sup-
port and sympathy of a very large majority of the
Manly residents, many of whom are shareholders,
and who are increasing their holding, whilst
numerous applications are being received from
other residents. At least 90 per cent, of the cargo
is secured by the company.
Designs of steamers by the well-known naval
architect, Mr. Walter Reeks, are in the hands of
the Directors, who will, immediately sufficient
shares have been applied for to warrant them
doing so, proceed with the building of vessels,
which will be of the most improved type, fitted
with the electric-light throughout, and all the
latest improvements that science can suggest, com-
bining speed, comfort, and safety, and capable of
running the trip in 25 minutes.
Shares are offered on the following terms : Is.
per share on application, Is. per share on allot-
ment, the balance by calls not exceeding Is. per
share at intervals of not less than one month.
Applications for 2500 shares are now in hand,
although the Directors have not pressed forward
the issue, pending the Minister’s decision re the
wharf. This having been favorably declared, early
applications for shares is necessary.

There were two football matches on Sydney
Cricket Ground last Saturday. The Randwick-Wallaroo
match was in every way a scientific and entertaining
shindy. There was only one temporary corpse, who was
soon resurrected. The Randwicks, who are the heaviest
team this year, came on the field with a record of 57
points scored against, all previous adversaries’ nothing.
So that when Wallaroo, by better forward combination,
got a try to Randwiok’s 0 in the first half, people began
to be wise after the event. But in the second half the
premier team bore down its opponents and scored nine
points to their 0. Randwick thus won by nine points to
three.

The Essendon footballers now see that nothing

The theory on which men are handicapped by
N.S.W. Cash Cyclists’ League is all flapdoodle. Says the
League: “Fifteen yards start is no start, because the
man in front merely acts as a pace-maker for the men
behind, and, therefore, assists the back men to beat him ;
but give a man 25 yards start, and then, then the back
man has to catch him.” And this is acted on as a big
principle, in face of the fact that the most desperate races
are ridden over and over again where one man keeps but
a yard advantage over the other. Fifteen yards is a
huge handicap ; give Lewis 15yds. start of Megson in a
mile, : and see if Megson will consider Lewis a pace-maker,
A simple experiment like that can always disprove a
stupid theory.
r * ♦ ♦ •
One fundamental objection to cash cycling is
that the majority of riders will naturally ride “ stiff" in
order to secure so big a; handicap in some future event as
to make victory and cash (not honor) certain. How many
of the present flight of cash cyclists are working this
dodge? How few are not! Mammon pollutes even men
with minds; and cyclists and other athletes are usually
physical successes with small minds or no minds at all.
The incessant idea of cash, and cash only, demoralises
them at hurricane speed.

Thejbieycle thief in Australian cities is giving
way to the bicycle “finder.” A cyclistleavinghismachine
in the street for a few moments comes back to find it
g me. ;Next morning his machine is advertised : “Pound,
a bicycle ; finder expects reward.” On enquiry it turns
out(«o the finder says) that the said “finder” “found”
the cycle some 20 miles away, and spent all the night and
early morning in bringing it home; being too poor, &o.
The cash cyclist generally gives him a shilling or so.

Huret, the French cyclist, has ridden the won-
derfutdistance of 515 miles in 24 hours ; an average of 21$
miles per hour. The previous best was the 462-mile per-
form nice of the Englishman, Shorland. It must be borne
in mind that Shoriand’s ride was done on an uncovered
track, where the wind and night dew affected him. Huret
rode under perfect conditions—on a covered-in track.
Cycling is seriously competing with horse-racing in
France ; as many as 800 entries have been received for a
single road-race there ; and nearly every daily paper in
Paris has its cycling column.
• * * *
Huret’a 24 hours’ ride is not to be compared
from the point of sleepless cycling with G. P. Mills’ ride
from Land's End to John o’ Groats. He rode for three
days, 14 hours, and 15 min., without one moment of sleep,
without once reclining to rest. He lowered the previous
record by 9 hours 40 min., and he rode the last part of his
trip at the rate of 16 miles an hour.

Given fair play, Ted Pritchard (says The Bul-
letin’s London correspondent) would most undoubtedly
have bealeniigm Smith in their recent Holhorn battle,
but, as usual, Smith’s adherents consisted of the very
cream of ruffianism, who did their worst, and succeeded.
This is the third fight of Smith’s in which the blackguard
element has prevailed. Pritchard, it is true, is but the
shadow of the smart boxer who made himself so popular a
few years ago, but he was able for all that to give Smith
more than he got. It was a case of mere rough-and-
tumble, and when Smith happened to knock Pritchard on
to the ropes, the adherents of the quondam champion got
hold of him and held him down so that he could not get
up within the prescribed time. This should quite finish
English glove-fighting, and really one cannot wonder that
Corbett has some doubts about getting fair play in
London. Jem Smith, say what they will, is a game bit of
stuff, for he took a lot of punishment from Pritchard
without flinching. Jake Kilrain gave him enough to
knock the heart out of a lion, yet he came to the scratch
as if nothing had happened.

A Victorian testimonial to Harry Boyle was
only started five days before the veteran’s departure for
Bananaland, and, although he was to receive the purse of
sovs. on Saturday last, the door of the subscription-room

the old, reliable'bowler, the Alfred Shaw of many an Aus-
tralian and Vic. eleven. Also, he stuck to his club, the
East Melbourne, for 22 years, and behaved like a white
man all the time.

it up in London, and Lauri is to sing it in
Australia; it is to be well introduced in America,
and in Maoriland. where that clever comedian,
Percy, of the Pollard Lilliputians, is making a
feature of it- It is also a universal success and
heard every where. Paling’s have already cleared
the first big edition, and have got out two others
in E flat and F. It is certainly the funniest Irish
football-song ever written, and the press every-
where has risen to describe it as the best cojmc
song of the day, and funnier than Killaloe or
“ Ballyhooley.’’ It is just tlm thing for an aspir-
ing comique, pro. or amateur. * „
“The race with the healthiest stomach
rules the world,” says Bismarck. And therefore,
in the solemn night-bush, when the adamantine
pancake lies, like the curse of Deeming, upon the
aching liver ; when the roast sucking-pig squeaks
loudly in the stomach, and wages insolent war
upon the holy and blessed office of assimilation;
sufferers at once arise ! and take a dose of Corn-
well's Extract of Malt.

Dear Bulletin, —A nut for the sex-
equality people ! The occasional alleged male who
has a weakness for paint and powder, pads and
skirts, is a sub-feminine anomaly—recognised as a
modified instance of the disease of “sex-perver-
sion.” Normal man never copies woman, whereas
normal woman—or a good many of her—imitates
man for all she’s worth. She puts three inches of
his stature under her heels, and six more on top
of her head. She lias taken his hat and his coat,
his shirt and his cigarette ; she’s reaching out for
his pants, and, if her little stomach would stand
it, she’d collar his pipe. It’s only a poor imita-
tion, after all, but it’s pretty well meant —for an
“equal 1 Ueketic.

At Castlemaine (Vic.) the other night)
three new-made knights breathed their sentiment B
over a banquet to the local bowling-club president-
J. B. Patterson said there was “nothing to keep
this fine country depressed but crass ignorance ’’ —
Protection being tlie crass ignorance he had in
view. Zeal, the figurehead of the Leg. Council,
observed that “he did not desire to have such
frivolous questions as women’s suffrage interfer-
ing with important measures;” and old Jock
MTntyre, with true statesmanlike feeling, in-
formed the banquet that “if the ladies got into the
House, lie would pair with some of them and go for
refreshments.” Three belted knights don’t often
descend upon a one-horse town at one fell swoop,
and the remarks they fire off upon such an ex-
ceptional occasion deserve careful record.
At the recent Dublin Agricultural Show—
the most important event of its kind in Ireland—
the gold medal offered for the best cream-separator
was awarded to the Alpha “ B.” machine, which
separated 66 gallons of cream in an hour. The
“ Humming Bird ” separator, another machine of
the Alpha type and by the same makers, Was also
specially commended as the best for small dairies.
The Alpha separators have secured a long series
of prizes at many different shows, the Dublin
award being the latest. Messrs. Waugh and
Josephson, of 342 Sussex-street, are the Sydney
agents for these valuable appliances.
In a chemical factory in Alsace, lately—
according to a ghoulsoine London paper—a work-
man fell into a vat of sulphuric acid, and was
entirely dissolved along with his clothes. At
least, he went a-mis>ing, and the above result was
afterwards deduced from some buttons found in
the vat. This event seems to open out a lot of
new possibilities for the novelist, whose villain is
always greatly embarrassed with “ the body.”
Even though he throws it overboard in mid-ocean,
or buries it in a cave and weighs it down with
stones, it insists on turning up again in the third
volume. What is wanted is something that will
utterly obliterate and blot out “ the body,” and
then the way of the villain will be easy, and the
hero won’t always make us feel mad by recovering
the property in the last chapter.
REMORSE.
To know that I have sinned ; to feel all day,
r 1 And every day, the scourger’s lash that cuts
The deeper that its marks are hid away
From human sight. To know that one soul shuts
Henceforth the door of joy and peace and love
Upon itself through me and me alone;
And hopes for nothing more below, above,
r Except to quickly die—making no moan
To call for the pity for a broken life—
Giving me no reproach for that base part
That I did play to win—unequal strife —
A devil’s science ’gainst an angel’s heart.
To know all this, and yet live on—ah, well!
No need to wait for death to taste of Hell!

STATUTORY DECLARATION:.
I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, in the Colony of Nevr
South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows ; Whereas I suffered severely from
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to my business. I tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as
a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alfaline Vitality Pills,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured Me within a few weeks, andl
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. The Alfaline Pills also'
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true. —

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testi-
mony carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr Rassmussen.— Dear Sir, —I think it my duty to
inform you that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervmis system,,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

Herr Rassmussen. March. 15th, 1894
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer fromi
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years,, andl
having tried without success several of the' leading doctors both iru
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies..
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most bappy to recommendi
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for yonr
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
: this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P,, with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline-
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that,
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated—
nut only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to.
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more-
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.

Admiral Hornby, who died recently at the
age of 70, was commonly described as “ the
greatest sailor of our time.” Yet be was only
twice in action in his life. In his boyhood he was
present at the bombardment of the crumbling
town of Acre. And in his old age, when he com-
manded the British fleet in the Sea of Marmora,
he sent a boat’s crew ashore to burn and demolish
the illicit grog-shop of a certain Greek who sold
bad liquor to Ins sailors. Hornby didn’t actually
take a hand in this exploit, but as the burnt-out
Greek stood on the shore and shook a stick at him
it may be charitably set down as the second time
he saw active service.

SKIN DISEASE
CURED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. Geo. W. Burtner, Keezletown, Va.,
writes, as follows:
« Shortly after leaving college, I was troubled
with a skin disease which showed itself, first, at
the ankles. Physicians pronounced it eczema,
and treated me for that complaint. The erup-
tion crept slowly up my limbs, and on the body,
until it enveloped the whole frame. It gave me
Infinite trouble with constant itching, casting off
of dry scales, and a .watery liquid which would
exude from under the scales. I treated it for
over three years unsuccessfully, and was unable
to check it, until I began using Ayer s Sarsapa-
rilla. I used three bottles of this medicine and
was completely cured —my skin becoming as
smooth and clear as before.”

PRIVATE LETTERS.
“ It Is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to toll you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Bgngers Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he ah'e to
rear her. We took her tothe
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ' P (tiger's
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”

Millionaire Astor, London, with' his
literary fire-irons, must surely be exploited by
some Mortimer Franklyn.
“ Four out of every nine persons, in Eng-
land, over 65, die paupers.”— Chamberlain, in
a word, live to be 65 in England and it’s only
5 to 4 that you don’t die in the workhouse.
For coughs, colds you can’t beat Colemane
and Sons Eucalypte Extract.
In Oldham (England) and its immediate
neighborhood there are 93 cotton-spinning com-
panies, In 1890, eight of these worked at a loss ;
in ’9l, 49 of them ; in ’92, 57; in ’93, 63; and in
’94, no less than 67, so that only 26 are paying
their way. Alleged cause, the competition of the
cheap Bombay nigger and the Jap. (for the trade
in their own countries).
“Prahran, the second city of Victoria,’
is senator Gray’s modest way of describing the
place which returned him to Parliament at last
general election. Melbourne, including Prahran,
is the first city of Victoria, and Prahran, exclud-
ing all other component cities of the first city, is
the second city. What paltry nonsense is this
provincial craze for calling every suburb a city !
One metropolis—one city.

Mr. Nathan Herman, of the Misfit Par-
lors, No. 9 Wynyard-street, Sydney—the place
where the big banner is, and where the immense
“9” looks like a frozen boa-constrictor over the
door, and the huge lamp serves as a beacon to
guide the wandering footsteps of the pilgrim from
the bush —has vastly increased his business within
the last few weeks. A mammoth new depart-
ment has been added for the sale of furniture,
crockery, pianos, bedding, ironmongery, &c., and
the young man who is going to get married, and
be afterwards run-in on his mother-in-law’s evi-
dence, can here find absolutely everything that
he wants. A new feature of the jewellery depart-
ment is the reliable watch, with gilt chain which
looks like gold—Ml for 6s. fid. The misfit tobacco
and cigar department has been greatly enlarged,
and all kinds of plugs are now supplied. Herman’s
tea is a wonderful speciality. The dress and
mantle department has also greatly expanded, and
a large staff of ladies—most of them young and
beautiful—are kept on hand to make all necessary
alterations while you wait. Sundry large ship-
ments of Brussels carpets have arrived, and are
being sold at 2s. a yard, with no charge whatever
for making and laying; and various consignments
of rugs, blankets, boots, shoes, overcoats, water-
proofs, &0., &c., are being sold at the same ruinous
rates. Also, the four winds which blow in the
halls of heaven continue to bring in orders from
everywhere for the famous £2 parcel, which in-
cludes a suit of clothes, two boiled shirts, two
under-shirts, six pairs of socks, two ties, two
collars, six handkerchiefs —no person with the
kind of cold which prevails just now can get
through with less than six—set of studs, hat, pair
braces and a pair of boots. The said orders, each
with remittance attached, now average 100 daily,
and many letters expressing the satisfaction of
the purchasers can be seen at the office. A large
consignment of misfits in every branch of clothing,
and bought at merely nominal prices, has just
been received per Orotava, and Mr. Herman is
shortly starting for Europe to make contracts for
the purchase of all misfits from the leading tailors
of London, Glasgow, Liverpool, Paris, Vienna,
and other cities. When this arrangement is com-
pleted, he calculates that the business will be the
most extensive of its kind south of the line.
Meanwhile, an additional elevator is being put in;
and the trade is already slopping over far beyond
the limits of the original premises, and Mr. Her-
man is concocting schemes for absorbing the whole
block from George-st. right down to York-st.

ago, at the celebration of his 50th legal anniver-

men which had come under his notice during his
long career, fully 70 per cent, were false, and of
the remainder many were not proven. “ Many
legislators, in amiable imbecility, took the part of
women against men ; but it was really the men
who needed-protection.”

The other day a Queensland Minister of
the Crown had just taken his seat in a reserved
carriage when two ladies walked in. They had
golden hair, large white feathers in their hats,
and soft, lustrous eyes that “flashed on you a
volley of rays that said a thousand things at once.”
They smiled on the Minister with a brace of
smiles sweet as the honey of Mount Hybla, and
“hoped they were not intruding.” Just then a
cold-blooded guard, with grey eyes, a sharp nose,
and thin lips, rushed up and called the two ladies,
somewhat imperatively, to “come into another
carriage !”

In 1870, when W. H. Walsh was Minister
for Railways, he ordered that no women of im-
moral character were to be allowed on the rail-
ways, and stationmasters were actually instructed
not to grant tickets to any member of Phryne’a
giddy brigade. The refusal of a ticket to an ex-
governess of clean reputation promised to create
very unpleasant complications, and the insane
orders were promptly cancelled. An account of
the actual origin of the anti-Lais regulations
would be too sweet for anything.

No prouder man than the late Hon. Louis
Hope ever stood on Australian soil. His family
pride was really a monomania of a kind common
to the “old nobility” of both civilised and
savage races. It was similar to that of the Khan
of Tartary who, after his dinner of mare’s milk
and brown bread, ordered a skin-clad ruffian to
proclaim that all the princes and kings of the
earth had now his gracious permission to go and
dine. Hope started to form the first Q. sugar-
plantation in ’63, at Cleveland, 25 miles from
Brisbane. One day, when engaged in hoeing cane,
he was visited by Gov. Bowen, Lord Onslow and
Premier Herbert. Herbert walked up to Hope
and told him of the two distinguished visitors
who had come to look over the estate. “Very
well, show them round !” said Hope, not even
looking up or stopping his hoe. He once sum-
moned the late Murray Prior for taking a pine-
apple, but the case was “settled out of court.”
At first he wanted to make it a charge of larceny,
but the idea of Murray Prior stealing a pine-apple
evoked giggles from even the police-magistrate’s
dog.

One of the early Queensland Governors
was suspected of somnambulism whenever the
handsome wife of a well-known official of that
date was a guest at Government House. In order
to dispel or confirm the unworthy suspicion, one
of the domestics was bribed to sprinkle a layer of
dry flour in front of the Governor’s bedroom door
after he had retired, and another layer in front of
the lady’s chamber. An examination at a very
early hour in the morning revealed the astonishing
fact that to be continued some other time.

The present wives of two Tar Southern

She married a member of the Vic. Parliament,

day in her new home, surrounded by some.visitors

The recent resignation of the commander-
in-ohiefship of the “Army of Queensland,” by
Lieut.-001. E. R. Drury, C.M.G.—haw—recalls
one or two reminiscences of that famous eye-
glassed warrior whose financial genius the
Q.N.B. rewards with a salary of £3500. Drury
was a smart and plucky athlete in his young years,
and scored three points out of nine in a bayonet
v • sword combat with the _ famous Professor
Parker, at Brisbane, in the sixties. (Parker, by the
way, was the original of Dickens’Sergeant George
’ n 14 Bleak House ”). Drury was also an unpleasant
person with his bare hands. He was accustomed
to lunch at a hotel that stood on the site of the
Courier office. One day, while walking round
the table, before the bell rang, surveying the
dishes through his eye-glass, a Darling Downs
squatter came in and followed him round, looking
through a stirrup-iron, and finally gazed super-
ciliously in Drury’s face and remarked—“ Haw !”
Drury quietly said, “ I see you want to insult me?”
U e squatter said it might be taken in that
light if Drury so desired. “Ah, then we will go
outside,” said Drury, and they adjourned to the
backyard, where the stirrup-iron man was badly
knocked-out in the first round with a black eye
an£ f a damaged nose, and feelings wounded to an
extent beyond compensation. But many years of
turkey and cabs have changed Drury, and one
flush hit on the binjie would create a vacancy for
a bank-manager at <£2ooo per annum—because
nobody but Drury would ever receive £3500 in
tbese days-

A few miles from Brisbane there is a
hotel-keeper who has loaded himself to the muzzle
with dictionaries, and has a cheerful habit of
going off unexpectedly and scattering weird ortho-
graphical missiles in the wrong directions. Having
a bad cold recently, he told a visitor that “ My
barronical tubes are digested ! ” “ What portion
of your respiratory anatomy are those in?” said
the visitor. "None of your sarsikasms ! ”
grunted mine host; “ do you think I know all the
farmerscopia! ”

One of the members of the present Q. Par-
liament kept a small tobacconist’s shop in Mary-
borough back in the sixties. One day a black gin
walked in and wanted some cheap tobacco. The
future M.L.A. ordered her out and presented a
revolver to emphasize his request. The revolver
went off, the ball passed through the gin and she
staggered out and died on the footpath. The jury
returned a verdict of nob guilty, on the ground
that the affair was an accident—which it doubtless
was. But it is, or ought to be, a crime to point
firearms, loaded or unloaded, at your fellow-
citizen.

In the history of Queensland scientific dis-
covery there is one incident enveloped in a thick
fog. When Carl Theodore Staiger, now dead
some years, was Curator of the Museum he visited
Gayndah, on the Burnett River. At breakfast he
remarked'that “dis vas a very sthrange feesh on
mein plate !” There is a dark suspicion that this
piscatorial curiosity was skilfully fabricated by one
or two local conspirator jokists out of parts of a
eeratodus and two more common fishes, m order to
impose on the Teutonic scientist. Certain enough
is the fact that Staiger sent a fragment to Count
Castelnau, who actually named the supposed
original fish as “ Ompax spatuloides,” which
name is duly recorded in the list of Q’sland
fishes. Equally certain is the fact that no speci-
men of the ompax was ever seen before, and no-
body has ever seen one since. Perhaps Mr.
Illidge, the Gayndah postmaster and local ichthyo-
logist, can lighten the dark places of this Staigerian
mystery ?

The (English) Royal Niger Company has
grabbed in Africa a territory of about 500 000
square miles, containing a population of about 20
millions. Rhodes’ British South Africa Go. has
direct control over 125,000 square miles, and lays
claim to four times that area ; while the Imperial
British East Africa Co. claims sovereign rights
over no less than 750,000 square miles. Here,
then, are three chartered companies which have
extended British dominion over areas six times as
large as N.S. Wales!
The overbuilt condition of Melb. outlying
suburbs is partly evinced by the number of private
wooden buildings carted to and re-erected in other
districts during the last year. The Vie, Govern-
ment has adopted the idea of shifting old
buildings, and having found it much cheaper—in
one case—than building a new school, has just
accepted tenders for removing a ten-roomed school
building from dunes, and re-erecting it at Pern
Tree Gully, 200 miles away. Boom buildings are
now so cheap that it costs 50 per cent, less to carry
one 200 miles and put it up again, than it would
to erect the same building in the usual way.
Broken Hill has at present perhaps the
cheapest meat-supply in Australia. Mutton car-
cases are regularly auctioned singly, bringing
from Is. 9d. to 4s. 6d. each, families generally
combining to purchase. A Poolamacca pastoralisb
who originated the idea sends a truck-load of car-
cases daily by Tarrawingee tram (38 miles.) The
local butchers, who previously retailed mutton at
4d. per lb. and beef up to 9d., have brought prices
down to a nominal figure in consequence, bub
threaten to make up during the hob months when
the meat will not travel.

THE BELLBIRD RUNG HER HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ah! ’twas God-time in September, in that per
fumed hazel belt,
Where the musk-leaves, thick and waxen, from
their two sides throw the scent,
And the supplejack’s star blossoms in the endless
dewings melt—
When a bird said “ Love ” so often that a child
knew what he meant ;
When cream-cheeked Polly Ryan made her angel
eyes terrene
As I told her of the load of everlasting love I
bore,
And her glance made Heaven seem open, and the
roadside’s dewy sheen
Was to me as pearls which never grew, but ar e
for evermore.
And she said, “ Your kiss is folly !”
Bub she meant it not, rny Polly,
And we kissed adown that roadside, past the
grass edge and its loam,
And, deep from glen of fern,
As we loitered at the turn,
The bellbird rung us from the kiss—the bellbird
rung us home!
Oh ! ’bis death-time in this March time, but the
bellbird rings his bell—
In glad deceit from mossy floors the silver note
he sends,
And the sky is hodden grey and my heart it is i»
hell!
And bub another bellbird to the past a memory
lends;
And death-cheeked Polly Ryan no more hath
eyes terrene.
For her eyes are stars in Heaven, and their
glance the night winds bear !
And to me no heaven is open ! On her grave the
dewy sheen
Is as pearls that faintly glisten in the dusk of
my despair!
And no more my kiss is “ folly,”
For Death’s kiss hath dumbed sweet Polly,
And the bellbird that hath rung her to the grave,
edge, and its loam
Calls no more from glen of fern—
For she left me at the turn ;
And the bellbird rung us from the kiss—the bell,
bird rung her home !

In the Ward.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It wanted a quarter of an hour to midnight. The
stillness of the casualty-ward was only broken
now and then by a groan—the miserable language
of pain. The night-nurse had just come on duty.
She sat at a small table at the end of the, long
room, with an open book before her in which the
names and particulars of the cases received during
the day were carefully noted for her guidance. A
shaded lamp at her elbow threw a subdued light
upon the page ; and, as she turned her head to
listen to the heavy breathing of a patient, her pale
face, looking out from the circle of the rays, took
the likeness of a ghostly mask suspended in mid-
air.
A tall, dark-haired woman, with deep eyes that
shone, black-rimmed, amid the pallor of her face.
She wore a wedding-ring, the relic of a husband
she had deserted, of a child she had abandoned.
In one type of woman repentance finds expression
in some form of self-flagellation. Necessity makes
the wife, monotony discovers the woman, and
remorse produces the hospital-nurse.
Midnight striking, she moved up the long alley
■between the bed-rows ; here administering a dose
of medicine, there cooling a parched throat,
smoothing a pillow, and adjusting a bandage;
and so down the dim-lit ward to the table again.
There was one patient yet to be visited. A bed
isolated from the rest contained the latest case,
brought in that night. Its serious nature was
shown by the screen drawn around - often a sign
that the bed will be vacant by morning.
The nurse stepped to the table and made some
marginal notes in the book, then referred to the
last entry : “ Man run over—compound fracture
of the right thigh-bone—chest crushed in—exces-
sive loss of blood —vitality alcoholically impaired.”
She read the minute directions as to treatment at
the foot of the entry, and turned to pass round
the screen.
Suddenly a man entered noiselessly by the little
door communicating with the receiving-room, and
laid a hand on her arm. The nurse recognised
the house-surgeon. They stood together in the
shadow. On the edge of the table and on the floor
at their feet the lamp made a white splash of light;
beyond was the semi-obscurity of the ward, with
its vista of beds and the dim outlines of the
figures upon them. Through the silence the
labored breathing of the man behind the screen
came heavily in hoarse, convulsive spasms.
The doctor said something in an undertone.
He was a short, thick-set man, with a full under-
lip. The nurse shook her head slightly, and made
an irresolute motion in the direction of the screen.
The man caught her round the waist, and whis-
pered eagerly in her ear. The nurse’s deep eyes
sparkled, and a flush crept into her pale face. The
stiff folds of the white apron she wore rustled
gently as they rose and fell upon her breast. The
close atmosphere of the ward was charged with
human electricity. Through the half-open door
of the receiving-room filtered an inviting breath
of cool air, lightly stirring a stray hair upon the
nurse’s neck. With a movement gentle but
irresistible the man drew her to him.
At that moment, in the very instant that her
will yielded to his, the heavy breathing behind
the screen ceased suddenly. The silence roused
her as a sleeper rouses at the stopping of a clock.
The instinct of the nurse overcame that of the
woman. Picking up the lamp, she hurried across
the floor and turned back the screen. The man
lay huddled and still, with his knees drawn up and
one hand clenched on the coverlet. His eyes were
wide open, and she saw at a glance that he was
dead. She bent over the bed so that the light fell
upon his face.
It was her husband.
With a strange little shuddering gasp she passed
into the receiving-room with the doctor.

BERBA ESPINASSE.
On May 26 telegrams were sent for experi-
mental purposes from Derby, W.A., to Cape
York, Q., (7341 miles, the world’s record.) The
messages were distinct and altogether successful.
A fossilised Chinaman has been unearthed
near Wyndham, Westralia. The Argus corres-
pondent remarks cheerfully that “ the skin was
strong enough to allow of boat-hooks being thrust
through to lift the body, and attempts to cut it
with a spade were futile.” How nice !
An unbeliever arose at the first of Coun-
tess Wachbcoeister’s Melb. spook-lectures and
blandly inquired if she had experienced any of the
strange Mahatmio manifestations she was so
glib in connecting with H. P. Blavatsky. If so,
would she relate them. Replied the wily Coun-
tess : “ I make it a rule never to relate my per-
sonal experiences. I don’t want to be persecuted.”
Whereat the audience distinctly winked.
Look out for a revival of novels in which
the secret poisoner uses arsenic. The vogue for
the last few years has been to make aconite the
toxic agent. But, there are known to the practical
chemist since alkaloids in conjunction with basic
salts (for readiness in dissolving), have come into
general use, one or two absolutely colorless solu-
tions, a few or many drops of which would mean
a lingering death or an apparent stroke by light-
ning.
Seymour (Vic.) was lately troubled with a
violent lunatic who had a “mission.” His strong
point consisted in seizing small children on their
way to school and baptising them under a tap.
When he had baptised a terrified small boy he
would recite sundry passages of Scripture to his
drenched victim, and then turn him loose to take
hia moist and squashy way to his destination.
The lunatic was captured the other day while
holding forth to a small, soared inhabitant and
bobbing him up and down in a horse-trough for
the good of his soul, and peace is restored once
more.
A Bulletin man sate in a Melb. bar one
recent evening waiting to have a prescription
made up, when a nigger entered. The colored
man was barefooted, wore an old billycock, and a
blue jumper; he carried an absurd boomerang
under his arm, and, aS he entered, drew into view
from his breast a brass crescent inscribed “Jaoky,”
The bar was almost full of young fellows, and to
these the nig. pitched a woeful tale. He wanted
to sell the boomerang, also two alleged spear-
heads, and two bone tie-guards said to have been
carved out of a human fragment. The crowd was
touched, and God’s image in ebony realised 12/6
for his stock, and an enthusiastic young Austra-
lian provided him with half a tumbler of rum.
After he had gone, the conversation turned upon
the poor Australian aboriginals and their rapid
extinction, but the Bulletin man abstained from
dropping a sympathetic tear, frr the simple reason
that the “ native ” who had just left was a woolly-
headed, thick-necked, thick-lipped African black.
Amongst the important news of the day
in Wimmera Star (Vic.) the following occupies a
prominent place : “ We have been informed that,
owing to extremely urgent pressure having been
brought to bear on the popular landlords of the
White Hart and Royal Hotels, and owing to cir-
cumstances over which they had no control, they
have decided to reduce the price of beer to 3d.”
“We have been informed !” Superb diplomatist!
Certain Yic. sea-shore municipalities are
at present engaged in a fierce struggle for the
“honor” of receiving Gov. Brassey. For ven-
turing to suggest that Brassey should put in at
Brighton, and that the Mayor should wade into
the water and carry him ashore, a democratic
councillor was severely reprimanded last week.
Notwithstanding, a Port Melbourne councillor
next night expressed the popular sentiment on the
subject by saying that “the people didn’t care a
hang if the Governor were landed at Timbuctoo,
and brought on to Melbourne by flying-machine.”
Horrible !
The Duke of Hamilton waa only in hia
jubilee year when he died, t’other day, yet he
dated back, as a turf-plunger, to the Marquis of
Hastings era. He started to ruin himself in his
teens, but had the good luck to become so deeply
indebted to Pad wick, the money-lender, that he
couldn’t get rid of his property elsewhere. It
suited Padwick to assume a paternal control of
the young duke and his belongings. Hamilton
went abroad for a time, and lived at comparatively
mild expense, whilst Padwick pulled things round
for his obedient pupil and guarded him from rob-
bery by anyone save “dear old Paddy.” The
brainy usurer was, under the circumstances, the
best possible steward for the family estates.
At 30 years of age the Duke of Hamilton
found himself able to “go it ” as of yore, and
he has been going it on fairly rational lines
ever since. He wasn’t born with much brains —
the son of a father who broke his neck by falling
down a flight of steps when drunk, and a mother
who sought consolation in amours with footmen
during her husband’s lifetime—but fat Hamilton
had brains enough co know that Padwick was his
preserver, and act accordingly. A good many
yarns concerning this double-barrelled peer and
hereditary potentate have appeared in The Bul-
letin during the past 10 years. Any one of them
will serve as decent argument for the abolition of
the House of Lords. In his later bachelor days—
i.e., after the property had been “nursed,” but
before he got married—the Duke of Hamilton
would stay for weeks together at Newmarket, a
gloomy spot in the winter, and haunt the house of
his then trainer, Tom Brown. Mrs. Brown found
his Grace a great trial as a guest until she fortu-
nately thought of giving him a “solitaire” board to
amuse himself with. “Solitaire” was a fashionable
game for the young in those days. You had a
board and a number of glass marbles occupying
circular holes therein, and you fooled about with
your marbles until only one remained—solitaire-
in the centre hole. Any intelligent boy could
master the art of bringing this game to a success-
ful finish, but the Duke of Hamilton pegged away
hour after hour and never learned how to leave
the last marble in the middle of the board. He
was the premier duke of Scotland, and many more
things beside, but he confessed to his trainer’s
wife at the end of 10 weeks that “ solitaire ” put
too great a strain upon his intellect. It was a

It was at Bull!. The strike was ended and n,
beaten men were settling down to work « •
The struggle had been long, the strike-pay
and all hands were anxious to regain lost ern, J’
So risks were taken. K °und.
It was crib-time. Both Bill and Joe, mates f
years, were getting fagged ; blistered hands' , to j
all-round stiffness being the penalty of the i 0
spell. B 10n g
“ Bill, old man, thou’s been unlucky.”
“ We’ve all had a share of that, Joe but n

Down comes the coal; with it a set of timK

“No, no, Joe; I’m only a bit giddy, but T’n

demur, a compromise is arranged. Joe takes IVII
to the bank-head, past the whirling ropes and a

“My boys, my boys!” “Is there any hone»”
“My father’s in, and my brothers ! ” Some tear
their hair; others are as if frozen, A sight tn

charged with having in his possession a mackin-
tosh reasonably supposed to be stolen. The
mackintosh is a new one of grey tweed, and the
police will be glad to hear from any person who
has lost such a coat.” Anyone who wants a coat
for the cold weather will thus be able to acquire
one gratis, and get Alfred Sutton six months
