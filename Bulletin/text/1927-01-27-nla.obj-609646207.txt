ANYONE
ANYWHERE
ANYTIME
Ashore or afloat—in the city or in the home—at the
picnic luncheon or the festive board—there’s added relish
in a TRUE lager. As a gentle stimulant after strenuous
exercise, or as a wholesome beverage to accompany the
domestic meal—whether offered in the cause of hos-
pitality or enjoyed within the family circle—-for luncheon,
dinner or supper—for anyone, anywhere, any time—-
nothing more exactly meets the requirements of the
occasion than a glass of amber-tented “K. 8.” It’s a
TRUE Lager.

The Red Page
The Australian Stage in 1936
I find the subject of what the Australian
stage was in 1926 so barren that I turn
with relief to wfliat the" Australian stage
became in 1936. The tendencies which
made it what it became in 1936 were already
obvious in 1926. In that year pusillanimous
producers, impressed by the fortunes made
by the moving-picture magnates, were strain-
ing every nerve to make the legitimate stage
as like the silent drama as circumstances
would permit. A succession of feeble com-
edies, most of them from New York, occu-
pied the boards. Their humor was of the
obvious variety that characterises the mov-
ing-picture, their situations were as machine-
made as the cinema projector and their
dialogue was composed of movie sub-titles
couched in the American language. The
new ‘musical* comedies all - marched in the
same direction. Spectacles became more
gorgeous and expensive, voices grew thinner
and wit was replaced by movement. Time
had been when the great actor-producer was
monarch of the scene. In 1926 the pro-
ducer of the flesli-aud-blood play, like his
colleague of the celluloid drama, was in
supreme command. Stars, worshipped by
millions, spoke their lines at his dictation,
moved their hands and made their exits and
entrances like unintelligent automata
switched into action by his megaphone. He
made pictures out of living men and women,
but he did not make life.
In 1936 these tendencies came to fruition.
That was the year in which John Baird,
the famous English inventor, first got the
Jewish entrepreneurs of Hollywood to realise
the commercial possibilities of television.
Chromatic moving-pictures which depicted
nature in its own colors had been brought
to perfection by the French, the Germans
had discovered the secret of stereoscopic
photography, and another Englishman had
succeeded in photographing speech. Holly-
wood brought all these wonders together in
a magnificent synthesis. The moving-picture
in four dimensions, and satisfying all the
senses, was born.
Hollywood at once erected the greatest
tele-cinema station in the world. In the
studios the Tom Mixes continued to per-
form their deeds of derring-do; the Mary
Bickfords squeezed out their onion tears;
the Valentinos proceeded from one pictur-
esque adultery to another. But above the
studios loomed a new portent. Huge masts
from which were suspended complicated
aerials like gigantic spiders’ webs affronted
the heavens, and by the mere turning of
a switch the Pickford tear, the Tom Mix
fieroic and the amour?, of the Valentinos
were flung out upon t world.
It was not long fct ore the World, and
especially Australia, took heed. As has
been pointed out, the Australian stage was
already in a debilitated state. J. O. Wil-
liamson, Ltd., whose monopoly of the legiti-
mate stage was by this time complete, did
not take long to make up its mind. It
decided to capitulate, if capitulation it could
be called. Every theatre in Australia that
was not already devoted to American pic-
tures began frantically erecting wireless
aerials. White sheets were hung across the
stages where Nellie Stewart had once bowed
to thunders of applause, where Kenningliam
had sung his dulcet notes and where Ada
Reeve had convulsed delighted audiences.
Simple little radio receivers with the tele-
vision and tele-vocal additions, sent free by
astute Hollywood producers, were installed
above the galleries, the Australian orchestras
climbed out of their boxes for the last
time and the Australian mummers drew
their last pay-envelopes and filed silently
away, some to recount their past successes
and show their wounds on Poverty Point,
others to beg despairfully in Los' Angeles
for supernumerary jobs from their destroyers.
But, without knowing it, the great firm,
which for. generations had stood for what
was best in the theatrical life of the coun-
try, had signed its own death-warrant. It
was not long before the private citizen found
that, by spending a few pounds on a re-
ceiver and hanging up a bed-sheet in his
Sl i :tl rT S ii OOm ’ be cou . ld bring the lush beauties
ot Hollywood, their color and their song,
to his own fireside. Gradually the crowds
abandoned the city theatres, their lessees got
into difficulties with their landlords, and the
Australian stage became a legend.
Still, nothing is surer than that, even in
a world given over to machinery, life can-
not for ever be denied. Here and there, in
disused stables and ramshackle suburban
halls the devoted heirs of Shakspeare and of
Marlowe began to revive the Australian
stage. Australian playwrights began to write
Australian plays at first for little money
p u i? lways . withphmty of appreciation.
S ißp’ H r u d of U h l P assioul ess automatism
of the Hollywood buffoons, began, a little
shamefacedly at first, to leave their homes
and seek the halls where actors were not

uie u. I). Society over two voars ao n

peare UrS \\T h | in< fi vi . table reference to Sliaks-
that he '£rti!n ng iu C ° lltm . Ually reminded
mat ne dwarfed all other writers of his dav
and of the days that followed his.” R
a fact of somewhat disconcerting
significance that those of ShaLspeare’s con-
temporaries who wrote for the English
theatre of that period “dwarf all other
writers” of the days that followed them.
In Hazlitt’s large and glowing phrase:
“Shakspeare indeed overlooks and commands
the admiration of posterity, but he does it
from the tableland of the age in which he
lived. He towered above his fellows, ‘in
shape and gesture proudly eminent 7 ; but he
was one of a race of giants—the tallest, the
strongest, the most graceful and beautiful
of them. But it was a common and a noble
br00d.... Their works and their names,
‘poor, poor dumb names,’ are all that re-
mains of such men as Webster, Decker, Mans-
ion, Marlowe, Chapman, Heywood, Middle-
ton and Rowley! ‘How lov’d, how honor’d
once, avails them not’; though they were the
friends and fellow-laborers of Shakspeare,
sharing liis fame and fortunes with him, the
rivals of Jonfeqn, and the masters of Beau-
mont! and Fletchers well-sung,woes*!” Hazlitt,
by the way, styles Dekker the "sweetest” of
the giant brotherhood.
Thomas Dekker, Dekkar or Decker was
probably a Londoner, and more than pos-
sibly, judging from his surname, of Dutch
descent. He knew the language of Holland well
enough" to translate from it, and showed in
his plays and prose writings a curious know-
ledge of Dutch folk and Dutch books, and
his dramatic method had many a touch of
Dutch realism. He was born, perhaps in
Southwark, about the year 1570; but the
date of his death is variously given as 1637
and 1641, and, according to certain entries
in Ilenslowe's Diary, must have begun
authorship when he w.as 26 or 27 years of
age.
In 1599 he had no fewer than nine works
on the stocks, on his own account and in Col-
laboration with brother playwrights; and one
of the first of these was "The Shoemaker’s
Holiday,” recently presented by the members
of the Sydney University Dramatic Society.
This play is a fine, happy, rollicking comedy’,
combining Dutch realism with the character-
istic English heartiness which marked pre-
Puritanic times. It is almost the first, if
not the very first, of all Dekker’s extant
dramas—some 27 plays, masques and “enter-
tainments,” of which perhaps 12 were bv
Dekker alone and the remainder in collabora- .
tion with other dramatists. It has been
well said that there is hardly one of the
better-known Elizabethan dramatists with
whom he was not at some time a coadjutor.
In “Old Fortunatus,” the romantic and poetic
fantasy which has won acclaims from every
lover of poetry, which gained a tremendous
compliment from Charles Lamb, and which
Swinburne has lauded in dithyrambic sen-
tences that march like Tamburlane through
a Persepplis of the loftiest language, Dekker
enters the highest heaven of his invention.
Hazlitt roundly declares that Dekker's
two-part play of “The Honest Whore” is a
masterpiece, and says that each perusal made
him feel that he could not show his admira-
tion for the playwright Sufficiently. But the
second play, the sequel drama of “The Honest
Whore,” is written (it is alleged by Collier)
from the authors own bitter experience.
Between the two plays 20-odd years inter-
vened. In the first, the girl’s mention of
her father, Signior Orlando Friscobaldo, is
of the casualest. In the second play he has'
developed into the wronged and grieving sire
of an erring daughter, laden with a load of
patient sorrow, and the characterisation is
so supremely perfect in its consummate com-
pleteness that the reader finds no single word
of Hazlitt’s high encomium superfluous or
unjustified.
Thomas Dekker was the antetype of
the Spectator of a later’age. He wrote a
great library of prose literature of a charae-
teristically journalistic kind. He was the
keen-eyed observer, the man about town, the
flaneur of Elizabethan and Jacobean Lon-
don. Sir Walter- Scott went to Dekker’s
pages when lie wished to describe the British
faPttah and its street and tavern life, in
The Fortunes of Nigel.” Of some 14 prose
publications,. descriptive and humorous, four

ker s gaining the high praise of Swin-
burne) ; both in debt all their lives
and in gaol most of their lives on

perfectly healthy objection to being dragoo
into an appreciation of any of the a •
faculty does help by nmmtainmg a supp y
of competent teachers, but it is
sirilv a guarantee of musical cieativeness.
Revolutions are always hatched y
ties. Probably that is why, m tbrn musicaJ
dearth there is a tendency to look to tue
academic few to deliberately manufacture for
Australia a semblance of the artistic mih™
that is as natural as light and air to t le
cities of the older world. . ,
Australians are by nature a very musical
people, as visiting artists rarely forget to
tell us. In ordinary, every-day affans on
ambition may not carry us far beyond 1 -
Certain Party” or “Paddlin’ Madeline Home,
but a classical programme from Ivreislei 01
Rackhaus will arouse intense enthusiasm.
This is in large measure due to genuine
appreciation, but our flinty conservatism is
also a factor. We always accept the I.uio-
pean verdict. . „ , ,
Cosmopolitanism is all very well, but it
can never lead to anything but the re-hand-
ling of other people’s ideas. And though
art, like courage, is not a matter or geo-
graphical boundaries, Australians will never
be music-makers, in the larger. sense, until
they are stirred into something like race-
consciousness. Artistically, we are a pain-
fully young people, and still resent inter-
ference with the traditions in which we have
grown up, just as children rebel against
variations in a popular fairy-tale or nursery-
rhyme. We are shut oil’ from close contact
with the culture that is older, richer and in
most things rarer than our own. Not yet
aware of our nationhood, we are content to
sing old songs. We have no heroic stories
to tell in music, no foreign enemy near
enough to rouse our sense of race. Yet,
oddly enough, in a country that lias no past
to inspire creative work, innovations, either
literary or artistic, are not, as a rule, en-
couraged. . .
Of the many undoubtedly gifted musicians
Australia has so far produced, the late
Henry Tate alone has succeeded in sounding
a definitely national note, voicing the breadth
and freedom, the curious rhythm of our
life that has in it the suggestion of “the
bushman sitting loosely on the saddle all the
while.” With entire freshness of vision, he
found, in the changing moods of the bush
and the bird-calls, melodies that inspired
his "Bush Rhapsody”—a work fraught with
peculiar native beauty that was given a
memorable first performance by the Mel-
bourne University Symphony Orchestra last
winter. Tate’s artistic faith is clearly stated
in his “Australian Musical Possibilities.” “In
addition to the under-song,” he says, “the
musical aura of the bush, its charm, melan-
choly, grandeur and mystery, we have in its
wonderful bird-songs a treasure-house of
potential musical inspiration.”
Possibly the absence of the quickening
force of great creative musicians, whose ap-
peal is universal, has in the past made
music the cult of the few and divorced it
from the people to whom it rightly belongs.
We take ourselves too seriously ; we do not
embrace with joy the light opera and folk-
tunes and the lighter classics that people in
other parts of the world listen to naturally
and with delight on the esplanades, in the
gardens and in the cafes. Instead, we take
ourselves dourly to concerts —at infrequent
intervals. Periodically we export a genius
or two, and then settle down again to
mediocrity. There still are many gifted and
competent musicians in the country, but they
need leaders, and, above all, sufficient finan-
cial support to keep body and soul together.
No amount of “intensive culture” can be
a substitute for the love of music that makes
listening to a symphony or a string quartette
an intimate experience of passionate beauty.
That is wffiy Australia must look to men like
Henry Tate and to the foundation of perma
nent symphony orchestras, and not to
academic desrrees. for musical life.
SECOND FIDOLE.
Omar Himself
Tlie Omar Khayyam goldmine is by no
means exhausted Recently the remarkable
. . . , , .
discovery of a wnole series of new quatrains
was announced ; and doubtless there will be
otlier finds. But the translation of these
apparently authentic additions to the Rubai-
yat suffers from the fact that there is no
Edward Fitzgerald to treat and refine the
ore. Even Fitzgerald merely selected the
finest nuggets he knew, leaving the less pay-
able or more intractable stuff for others to
work over
Writing’in 1857 he admitted that “it is
in truth no translation—only a paraphrase
of a syllabus of the poem.” His edition is
limited to 100 quatrains; now J. B. Nicolas
has produced a volume containing 464. This
Nicolas is a French student of the Persian,
Arabic and Turkish languages, who was
attached to the French Embassy as secre-
t'OTv intprnrptpr TTp wflt; fortmintp in hnv-
tary-mterpreter. ±ie was iortunare m nav
mg the collaboration of a gifted scholar,
Hassan-Ah-Khan, Minister Plenipotentiary
for Persia at Paris. The French transla-
tion of Nicolas has now been put into Eng-
lish by Francis Dyson, of Sydney, and pub-
li«hod hv William Brooks also of Svdnev
lisnea by William Biooks, also or Sydney.
The translation is claimed to be ail authen-
tic and faithful rendering; but it is evident
that the translation of the Rubaiyat of Gliias
ud-din Abul Fatli’ Omar bin Ibrahim al
Ivhayyam, first into a foreign language
(French) and then into another foreign lan-
guage (English), removes the text and the
thought underlying it still further from the
original. It would naturally be thought
that these two major operations upon the
work must have proved fatal to the life of
the poem. Yet the sense still survives; and
there are many quatrains that closely re-
semble the work of Fitzgerald—and, pre-
sumably, that of the original Omar. Inevit-
ably the felicitous metre adopted by Fitz-
gerald could not be followed throughout;
and though there are rhymes for each quat-
rain, the conciseness of the Fitzgerald ver-
sion has to be cast aside. Here and there,
however, the translator has been able to
pack Fitzgerald’s quatrain almost as neatly:
Oh, double shame, this goblet fair to mould
In Beautv’s shape, and frame each tress of gold,
And then in whim or anger to destroy
With it the wine the lovely thing did hold.
My crimes no smoke to Heaven accusing send,
And none my sorry fate will e’er amend;
With hand oft carried o’er my aching head
I touch man’s robe and fail to find a friend.
No fear have I the vale of Death to tread,
Nor Life’s last slumber contemplate in dread;
I mourn to think the Summer passing by
Is passing swiftly—and the Rose is dead.
Take cup and gourd and with me, Sweetheart, go
By stream beflowei ed and peace a season know ;
Oh! many faces clear and sweet as thine
Lie in the dust from whence the gourd will grow.
This dust of mine, if freed from care and sorrow
(The Heritage of earth), would wake to-morrow
At Heaven’s gates—a spirit born anew,
Ashamed of dwelling here a day or two.
But liow much wc have to thank Fitz-
gerald for! His most famous quatrain is
no doubt more correctly rendered in this
translation; but how the beauty has been
drained from it! —
Sweet it is in Spring if sitting on a flower-besprinkled
mead; . , .
Wine-jar, rose-cheeked Houri near me —this weie
Paradise, indeed;
Never Priest to chide and threaten —lie that love
and wine are Sin ;
Bid me fly these present blessings—suppositious
Heaven to win.
“And wilderness were paradise enow!’’
There is no “suppositious” Heaven in lutz-
gerald. If this is how Omar is to be trans-
lated, let the old. chap die —as he would him-
self desire.
Yet the labor and care taken in this great
undertaking deserved their full meed of appre-
ciation. The astonishing thing is that, de-
spite translation and re-translation, the
thought comes struggling through. But we
see more clearly the value of Fitzgerald s
literary taste and poetic invention. How
carefully he sifted the first hundred gems
when in this apparently complete collection
of quatrains—464 of them —so little of poetic
worth is added, and so much is lost!
A. H. A.
Through the Dean's Spectacles
What the Dean of St. Paul’s has to say
about questions of the moment will always
be interesting; he is a shrewd observer and
an accomplished journalist. In Lay Thoughts
of a Dean, Dr. Inge has shown us the ease
with which his thought is made to serve
his mood. It would be idle to expect from
him consistent opinion; we look rather for
lively and pertinent comment on the opinions
of others, and of that this volume is full.
Characteristically, the Lay Thoughts are
found to include 10 papers on religious sub-
jects. In these the Dean overpowers the
journalist; in the others dean is content to
stand at journalist’s elbow. But the _ lay
thoughts are much the best. Aphorisms
have for him a strong attraction, especially
when they can be given a political applica-
tion ; as the Chinese, “He who rides on a
tiger can never dismount,” which lie deems
to be a useful warning for revolutionists,
and “A small loan makes a debtor, a large
one an enemy,” “which we should have
remembered before lending 800 millions to
the French.” He has a preference for the
aphorism with a tang; as Lord Chester-
field's “Labor more to put others in conceit
with themselves than to make them admire
you. Those whom you can make like them-
selves better will, I promise you, like you very
well” ; also Creighton’s “The two chief means
of teaching are exaggeration and paradox.” It
seems to him cruel to have made Creighton
a bishop, since he could say such brilliant
things. A deanery, fortunately, is to-day as
lucrative and more leisured.
It is pleasant to find Dr. Inge the occa-
sional victim of ancient prejudice, as when
he pronounces a typed letter to be a chilly
and repellent substitute for the written word.
A letter which is more easily written is
likely, other things being equal, to be much
better in itself, since labor is lessened; if
it be worse the fault is in the writer rather
than in his tool. Dr. Inge’s candor often
impels him to say things which are on the
minds of many, but which the occasion may
restrain them from saying. His review of
Walter Page’s “Letters” offers an example.
Almost all reviewers of those fascinating
volumes were content to see Page, as the
Dean also saw him, as one of the best friends
and warmest admirers that England ever
had, w r lio deserves to be gratefully remem-
bered by all future generations of English-
men. They passed over in silence the amaz-
ing passages in which Page wrote to the
President of taking the whole English world,
fleet and trade and all, to employ them for
the highest uses of democracy, and of lead-
ing the British and French, and developing
their whole people. Such passages help
to interpret to us the American mind, and
ought not to be courteously ignored. Further,
the Dean himself assists interpretation in
a paper which shows that the American
character is grounded in New England Cal-
vinism, though it has forgotten the rock
whence it was hewn: —
Till lately confidence in life has made the American
think that the Devil has forgotten America. So we
picture the typical American, healthy, clean-minded
and indomitably cheerful, springing from his bed in
the morning, and, after a bath and deep-breathing
exercises, to which he attaches great importance,
praying that in the coming day he may be helpful
to others, happy, strenuous and successful. He asks
himself no difficult questions; the proof of his religion
is that it makes him a very efficient member of
society. This kind of Christianity is so unlike
Catholicism that we may wonder what an American
does when he joins the Church of Rome. But he is
not at all embarrassed. America has four living
Cardinals.
Yet lie doubts whether American character
will survive the influx of immigrants dan-
gerous to the solidarity of the American
type.
The section which deals with social pro-
blems is perhaps the best in the book, with
its incisive criticism of some popular
fallacies. Of “Consumptionism,” for example
—the science of getting people to use more
and more things in order that consumption
may keep pace with production. There are
important consequences of this new science
or philosophy. American newspapers now 7
exist not so much to direct people how to
think, feel and vote rightly, as to arouse
new needs and teach people how to buy.
Advertisers prefer a few newspapers with
large circulations to many papers with
smaller ones; and papers of independent
vision and fine ideals are absorbed or extin-
guished, to the gain of commerce and the
loss of thought. Consumptionism is a philo-
sophy rooted on falsehood. We are not
really made wiser or better or happier by
complicating our lives with possessions. Dr.
Westcott said that everything which makes
life easier makes it poorer, less human, less
noble. And Consumptionism has a twin-
sister in Spoonfeeding, on which Dr. Inge
has a caustic essay.
Few will read these papers without dis-
agreement with Dr. Inge on some points,
none without appreciation of their wit.
Every page invites quotation: “The habit
of blaming and criticising our own country
is ingrained among Englishmen, and when
it is practised by sincere patriots it does
good. The British lion always rouses itself
to fresh efforts by lashing himself with his
tail.” “The result of general vegetarianism
would be that many species would cease to
exist. No one is so much interested in the
demand for pork as the pig.” “We have
often been told that the penny post killed
letter-writing—real letter-writing, that is.
But the twopenny post does not seem to
have improved the quality, or to have seri-
ously diminished the quantity of letters
which are certainly not literature.” “Byron,
I believe, said that his handwriting was as
bad as his character, which is hardly pos-
sible, since his letters have been deciphered.”
I end—quite irrelevantly—with a ques-
tion. Dr. Inge speaks of “my cathedral.”
Is not that phrase properly reserved to the
Bishop of London’s sole use?
A. H. G.
A Third Wordsworth
The Red Page remarks (30/12/’2(i) the
two Wordsworths —the skylark (as in the
“Ode to Duty”) and the barndoor hen (as
in “The Excursion,” with its endless common-
place lines, suggestive of the post-egg effort
of the domestic bird). I have discovered a
third, though appearing only in a flash —
Wordsworth the fighting-cock. In the 1828
edition he supplemented his collected work
with some lengthy “Observations.” In one of
them is a protest against hostile criticism of
verse of the tame-rabbit, I-met-a-little-cottage-
girl type, and Wordsworth (fitting, as it
seems to us, the cap on his own head very
appropriately) cites with disapproval old
Sam Johnson’s parody of it: —
I put my hat upon my head
And walked into the Strand,
And there I met another man
Whose hat was in his hand.
A little later he returns to the attack with
some acid remarks about “the habit of certain
poets of constructing a phraseology that has
one thing in common with genuine poetry,
that it is not heard in ordinary conversa-
tion,” but amounts nevertheless only to “a
motley masquerade of tricks, hieroglyphics
and enigmas. By way of example,” says he,
“take this specimen of Dr. Johnson’s metri-
cal version of a famous psalm:
Turn on the prudent ant thy heedless eyes,
Observe her labors, sluggard, and be wise.
No stern command, no monitory voice
Prescribes her labors or directs her choice,
Yet timely provident she hastes away
To snatch the blessings of a plenteous day.
And so on for a dozen or more lines of
typically pompous Johnsonese. “Turn to
the original ‘Go to the ant, thou sluggard,
says Wordsworth in supreme contempt, and
compare* “this hubbub of words. But un-
fortunately Johnson was dead when \\ ords-
wortli was still' a boy, so the shaft was be-
lated. One can, however, picture the didactic
old lexicographer, physically incapable of
turning in his tomb, getting off a thunder-
ous : “Sir, if you are incapable of compre-
bending the language I employ”-

a number of happily caught photos of his friends.

some.
Chrvs tab el’s Fairyland, by Adam Gowans Whyte
(Chapman and Hall). Adventures in Toy-land make
up a brisk and entertaining story for youngsters who
are of the city and know not the healthier outer
spaces. To young Australia it may make less appeal.
My Daily Message, by Millicent Preston Stanley
(Angus and Robertson). It has the appeal which
all this class of literature carries 'with it. “There:
Mary Anne, ain’t that just wot I was sayin’ !” It
is comforting and profound, as “Catch this minute.
It is passing—even now. Sixty precious seconds!
They come —'they are gone. Only a minute—yes,
and yet momentous things may happen in a minute.
A man may die. A child may be born. A star
may fall.” And, it might be added, a worm may
turn.
Eyes of a Gypsy, by John Murray Gibbon
(Methuen). This is the portrait of an American
Senator pen-painted by a compatriot: “The trouble
is that he is the spoilt son of old and degenerate
stock and has always handled more money than is
good for him. He does not know he is a crook, but
merely thinks he has a right to take what he wants.
Being a politician he naturally has no respect lor
the laws except where it suits his purpose.” The
heroine is a lady with a trace of Romany blood in
her veins and a palmist with exceptional gifts. She
has adventures, but they are no more than bits of
flotsam on a sea of talk —such quantities of talk
and to so little purpose.
The Quest of the, Trout, by R. L. Blackwood
(Robertson and Mullens). “As a conjurer can pro-
duce a rabbit from an empty hat, so he could
materialise a trout from a piece of water where you
knew perfectly well there was no trout—for you had
just gone over it thoroughly yourself.” Thus writes
a friend of the dead author, who in his lifetime
was sub-warden and classical tutor of Trinity
College, Melbourne. The book was written with
the object of helping beginners. It contains no fish
stories and no ecstasies on the/ delights of the sport.
“As a high expert in fishing he knew,” says H.
W. Allen in a foreword, “what to write, and as a
high expert in teaching he knew how to write it.”
The result is an admirable technical manual explain-
ing the approved methods of the trout-fisher in
Australian streams. Unfortunately the author did
not live to see his work through the press, and in
an appreciative note Mr. Allen quotes the prayer of
the true angler:
“Persephone, fulfil my wishes
And grant that in the shades below
My ghost may land the ghosts of fishes.”


A Studebaker Big Six Duplex-
Phaeton recently traversed the
roadless wastes of the Sinai
Desert from Cairo to Jerusa-

hours and 11 minutes. The trip,
never before accomplished by
a stock automobile, was easily
made by the powerful, de-

The Same
Unfailing Performance
Everywhere
IN the trackless wastes of the
desert, over rough mountain
trails, on smooth highways or
city boulevards—Studebaker
Cars deliver the same depend-
able, trouble-free service.
The quiet Studebaker L-head
motor, with its big crank-
shaft, fully machined
and dynamically bal-
anced, stands up under
the hardest ordeals and
continues to deliver pow-
er in abundance, smooth-
ly and unfailingly.
The Studebaker chassis,
built of fine steels for
which Studebaker pays a prem-
ium, possesses rugged strength
to give years of service, with
minimum upkeep cost.
Nine hundred forty-four owners
report their Studebakers having
been driven over 100,000 miles —
and still giving a full
measure of satisfaction.
To pay less for a car
than Studebaker asks is
false economy—to pay
more is extravagance.

Hampton Court,
Sydney,
June 25th. 1926.
Messrs. Beale and Co. Ltd.,
340 George Street,
Sydney.
Dear Sirs,
During my travels, I have been
enabled to hear all the great modern
pianists. Not always as frequently as
I had desired. My professional en-
gagements often clashed with my
wishes and limited my opportunities.
You will appreciate the extent of
my delight and astonishment, there-
fore, when I “discovered” the Beale-
Ampico. I had heard practically every
kind of reproducing piano. But this
was different —for when I sang the
“Indian Love Call” to an accompani-
ment recording played by Edgar Fair-
child on the Ampico, it was indeed
difficult to realise that the pianist was
not there in bodily presence. Amaze-
ment at what the Beale-Ampico can
do scarcely expresses my feeling.

MISS HARRIET BENNETT
and the BEA [Jh~4l}lpiCo
“amazed at what it can do”
Miss Bennett has scored a tremendous success among Australians as
the leading lady of the “Rose Marie Company. Her magnificent
Voice, her quick responsive personality, and her very feminine and
appealing charm more than justify that success.
But Miss Bennett is also a highly
accomplished musician with an un-
usually subtle and developed taste.
That is why her opinion of the Beale-
Ampico carries very great weight—the
more so as it is echoed by so many
eminent musicians.
Indeed, most of the world’s greatest
pianists (among them Rachmaninoff,
Moisei witsch, Lhevinne, Levitzski,
Hambourg, Godowsky, Teresa Carreno,
to name only a few) have allowed
their work to be preserved for future
generations on the Ampico rather than
on the ordinary player.
For the Beale-Ampico is emphatically
not a player-piano. A player in the
hands of a skilful musician is capable
of beautiful music, but it does not
pretend to give us anything comparable
to the work of the world’s masters.
That is just what the Beale-Ampic©
does give us. Except in the case of the
foot-blown model, the Beale-Ampico is
not controlled by human agency at all.
It produces, and can only produce, each
shade of expression, each touch of the
personality, the very genius of the
pianist who made the original record-
ing. When you hear the Ampico for
the first time, the effect is positively
uncanny.
And, of course, the Beale-Ampico may
also be played manually—it is the New
Beale Piano with the added potenti-
alities of the Ampico.
The Beale-Ampico must be heard to be appreciated—that is the only way to realise its
remarkable power. Beautifully produced descriptive literature will be forwarded on
request, but every effort should be made to hear the instrument at one of our branches.

The Suburb.
Dully-sounding, as in a dream,
Breakers surge on the ancient coast;
Sentinel lamps on the sea-front gleam,
Each like a pale And lonesome ghost.
Silence treading the darkness soothes
Height and hollow with gentling hands,
While, slow-rising, the night-tide smooths —
Smooths and cleanses the roughened sands.
File by file for a mile and more,
Like to torches whose light is quenched,
Pine-trees stand by the darkened shore;
Roots deep sunken and tops spray-drenched.
Scarcely seeming to draw their breath,
Slumber those pine-trees, black and tall;
Like to Dcatli or to After-Death
Seems the wonder that reigns o’er all.
Iveel-less, hull-less the wide sea lies,
Keel-less, liull-less, a region dim ;
No ship’s lights are yon lights that rise
Pale and far o’er the ocean’s rim.
Stars they are that have come to view
Night’s dominion o’er wave and land,
Seas unchartable sailing through,
Sped and steered by an Unseen Hand.
Mute, all mute, are the song and speech,
Mute the music and mirth of day;
Gone the surfers that thronged the beach,
Romping, racing through foam and spray.
Gone are the boats with their sails and sculls,
Riding the waves from trough to crest;
Gone the gannets, and gone the gulls
Wide of pinion and white of breast.
Till day comes, and, with rosy gleams,
Dawn thfOugh the eastern curtains peeps,
Wrapped in sileilde and spelled by dreams,
Hard by the sea the suburb sleeps.

ENVY.
She wdtched the auction in the market-place.
The strong white body Of a Grecian girl
Flashed in the sun. Her eyes like emeralds
Glowed in a setting carved from a pearl.
She watched the lounging traders—how
bid,
And how teeth plucked at loose unshaven
lip,
And how the Greek girl saw them so, and
turned,
Swinging a little with one polished hip.
And memories came like seeking hands to
press
Blood from the frozen thing she called
her heart;
The slow tears fell, while all around her
rang
The song and clamor of the auction-mart.
The slow tears fell. Her lord was kind, but
old
Ah, could she be a slave again to know
Suspense, surmise, adventure —wondering
where
The dainty gift that was herself • should
go?
She watched the auction-mart, and, watching,
sighed
Not for the olive-groves and marble
shards,
But for the dingy crowds that bought and
sold
Bright women in the Carthage cattle-
yards.

Pale Rosamund.
Pale Rosamiund walks past the pools of light,
Haunting the shadowy archways of the
street,
Long after its slow pulse has ceased to
heat —
A shadow seeking shadows in the night,
Noiseless t and fleet.
Her face is masked in white. Two scarlet
bows;
Are drawn across her lips, a curve of
shame!
Within her'sombre,eyes smoulders a flame
That flings the world s defiance, for she knows
Its bitter blame.
Along the jewellers’ garish shops she slips,
Where carded' gems prismatic rainbows
fling;
Her weary feet tap lightly, loitering,
Pale Rosamund with her alluring lips,
Soliciting!
She plays the only .part that’s known to her,
She who has set upon her soul no ban—
She who has only known within her span
Man’s lesser needs, and who must minister
To any man.
Yet trailing down the resonant, long street,
. A creature of the dark and dreadful night.
She feels beside her, crowding out of
sight,
Dear phantoms of a time when youth was
sweet
And morning-white!
She walks again behind the lazy cows,
Barefooted by the river’s rose-banked flow.
She climbs once more the ridge where pine-
trees blow,
And shakes the golden pollen from the
boughs
As long ago.
And dreaming as of old, she dreams that one
Who loves will come and tilt her little
chin,
And kiss her lips and say—dear Pala-
din !
“Oh precious heart, you are my moon, my
sun,
You. without sin!”

THE COLLIER GOVERNMENT ALSO
GETS READY.
Like the Labor Ministry in South Aus., the
Collier Government in Westralia is making
its arrangements for a general election. It
has been in office for nearly three years, and
was lucky to get there, for its victory at the
polls was due, in the main, to the follies
of its opponents. Public opinion, though by
no means favorable to Labor, was un-
easy at the non-fulfilment of Premier
Mitchell’s promises regarding his group
settlements, and the mounting expenditure,
much of it notoriously wasted, on those enter-
prises. Partly because of the group settle-
ments, Mitchell quarrelled with the Coun-
try Party organisation, which had been an
important factor in keeping Labor in the
cold shades for eight years, and most of the
Cocky members went into opposition. Above
all. Mitchell weakly allowed two or three
selfish supporters, who could have been put
down easily enough, to kill an overdue
Redistribution of Seats Bill, which would
have wiped out half a dozen Labor pocket
boroughs on the goldfields. The result wias that
Collier got a better majority in the Leg.
Assembly than Mitchell had towards the
end, although his party once more failed
to get a majority of votes —a feat which it
hasn’t performed, or Federal Labor . either,
since 1914. There are 50 seats in the
Assembly, and the Colliers went back with
27. The one-vote-one-value system, which
Labor so warmly supports in Victoria, would
have given them no more than 22.
* * * *
Comparing Collier with Mitchell, ' Gro-
perland has no regrets for what happened in
1924. The Labor Premier is an able Parlia-
mentarian, and has been well served on the
administrative side by at least two of his
colleagues, Angwin and Troy ; so the Gov-
ernment is rated a bit above the West-
ralian average, except in one respect. It
was shrewd enough to see that the Westra-
lian public would stand no more State social-
ism of the sort that Jack Scad dan went in
for in liis youth, nor any of those wild experi-
ments in the new Laborism with which
Theodore was identified in Queensland and
Lang is identified in N. S. Wales; in
spite of all temptations, it has in these mat-
ters kept to the safe path. Its financial
record is not as good as that of the Lyons
Government (Tas.) —that remarkable Admin-
istration which almost contrived to get along
without borrowing in 1925 —but it is not
as bad as that of Hill, or McCormack, or
Allan, or Lang. If it has kept on spending
loan money at the Mitchell rate, it hasn’t
antagonised the London financiers in the
senseless Lang fashion ; Henry Braddon has
testified that, while the said financiers have
lost their enthusiasm for N. S. Wales flota-
tions, “Westralia stands quite high in their
regard.” The Colliers have been helped
by good seasons and other circumstances
over which they have had no control, or very
little. Eastern Staters have discovered (1)
that f.a.q. wheat land with a regular rain-
fall is cheaper in Westralia than elsewhere,
besides being nearer the seaboard as a rule,
and in all cases nearer the European market.
and (2) that wool of excellent quality is
grown in the Westralian hinterland, where
vast stretches of country with good feed and
water can still be acquired at comparatively
low prices. So a brisk demand for wheat
farms has set in, particularly from South
A us.; and Vic. squatters are spending heaps
of money in pastoral ventures, mostly on
abandoned goldfields. Moreover, the Bruce
Government, moved by the cry of the West-
ralian Federal members that their thriving
State has been ruined by Federation, has
granted Collier £565,000 during the last
two years, in addition to about £1,200,000
under the 255. p.h. arrangement which should
have expired in 1920 : and it has promised him
£657,000 p.a. for 10 years (the first year’s
instalments are keeping 2000 men going)
for “Federal aid” roads. Collier is using
part of the £565,000 to finance a one-third
reduction in the State income-tax, and the
road money is also being spent where it
will do most good, from the Labor point of
view. The simple faith of the Bruce-Bages
is greatly appreciated at the Perth Trades
HalL
* * * *
Connivance in a gross electoral scandal is
the worst blot on the Collier Government’s
fame. By refusing to introduce a democratic
Redistribution of Seats Bill it was guilty
of a far more flagrant offence than the Vic.
Aixancocks committed in putting through
their Redistribution of Seats Bill; yet the
Allancocks have been targets for the mud-
slingers of a continent, while the Colliers
have escaped. The present monstrous
arrangement of electoral boundaries dates
from 1911. It was denounced as an out-
rage by the Collier party when brought in
by the late Frank Wilson, and passionate
undertakings were given that it would be
altered at the first opportunity; but the
passionate undertakers have made no honest
attempt at altering it, although they have
been in office, off and on, for eight years. In
point of fact, the thing was always a good
arrangement for the Labor party, which won
the 1911 election wifh a majority of 18;
and in process of time it has become so
immensely favorable —chiefly owing to the
decline of population on the goldfields, where
Labor is relatively strongest—that the party
has completely surrendered to the gerry-
mandering spirit. On June 30 this was the
astonishing position in 46 constituencies, 23
Ministerial and 23 Opposition, according to
the Electoral Registrar’s figures;—
23 Labor Seats. 23 Opposition Seats.

The other four electorates are East Perth
(8590), Guildford (9857), Leederville
(11,999) and Canning (15,116). They were
represented by Laborites in the late Par-
liament, but all four have been held by
Nationalists for long periods, and may, of
course, revert to Nationalism. On the other
baud, the Ministerialists may capture Mt.
Margaret (461) and Gascoyne (1287), which
have been theirs in other Parliaments,
together with Roebourne (562). If the elec-
tion were held on the June rolls, and these
changes occurred, but no others, Labor would
win 26 of the 50 seats, though representing
only 60,075 of the 206,545 electors. With
a 60 p.c. poll (and that percentage was only
slightly exceeded in 1924 and hasn’t been
reached on other occasions), it would be
mathematically possible for the party to
win 26 seats with a mere 18,050 votes. The
Government is confident of being returned
with a good majority ; and no wonder. All
the same, it has placed a weapon in the
hands of its enemies with which it will be
severely smitten some day. A party may
gain temporarily by being dishonest in these
matters, but it always loses in the long run.
EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY OF A
REPUBLIC.
During . this year a quaint little republic
will celebrate the 105th year of its settle-
ment and the 80th year of its complete
independence. In the early days of last cen-
tury some philanthropists in the United
States and Britain bought up the sovereign
rights of an area on the West African coast
from persons who presumably had authority
to dispose of them, named the place Liberia,
and invited the free colored folk of the
United States to enter and take possession.
High hopes were entertained of the African
intellect in those days, and many good people
believed it would develop and flourish won-
derfully, especially if given 25 years of pre-
liminary tuition. There are large but rather
vague assertions to the effect that the same
intellect has lately begun to blossom like
the rose in the States themselves, and that
it is quite capable of cultivating itself in
universities of its own, though last census
revealed that 23 per cent, of the colored
population aged 10 years and upward was
still quite illiterate. Liberia approaches to
twice the area of Tasmania; but if it had
revealed a Napoleonic spirit in earlier days,
it might have expanded indefinitely, for,
barring some small and scattered patches,
the Dark Continent was at the disposal of
any strong people who carried a sword and
a light. Now the situation is altered, for
Liberia and Abyssinia are the only inde-
pendent native States which remain. In
Morocco, though a shadow Sultan stays on
and the Sheerefian umbrella is handed down
from sire to son, the old order has passed.
* * * *
The first disappointment lay in the dis-
covery that the African raw material on
which reliance was placed lacked the adven-
turous and colonising spirit. When Liberia
was founded there were about 250,000 free
colored people in the U.S. to choose from,
and in 1847, when the republic was estab-
lished, there were 400,000. After the Civil
War and the Liberation there were nearly
5,000,000. Still the only really black repub-
lic on earth failed to attract a rush of ambi-
tious black immigrants. In 1573 the popu-
lation was estimated at 19,000 tame negroes
of the ruling, or nominally ruling, caste, and
701,000 wild ones, who were said to be in-
creasing mightily. The list of Presidents
then numbered six, each of them coal-black,
of American descent, legally appointed (for
feverish revolution was not in the blood),
aged 35 years or more, possessed of £l2O
worth of property and a decent suit of
clothes, and each undistinguished like the
rest. The revenue in those unexciting times
amounted to £41,978 for the year, and the
capital, Monrovia, had an estimated popula-
tion of 13,000. Time rolled on and brought
changes. In 1924 the population was set
down at about 20,000 tame negroes of the
ruling or imported caste, between 2,000,000
and 2,400,000 wild specimens, and 50,000
coastal samples who had been wild but were
said to be getting over it. The amazing in-
crease in the alleged number of the untamed
tribes is set down in part to extensions of
the frontier (done with British and French
assent and connivance), partly to a more
sanguine estimate and partly to actual ex-
pansion. The revenue had gone up to
±140,000, and the alleged population of the
capital had gone down to 10,000. Some esti-
mates said 6000. F'or a country with 350
miles of coast and 15 recognised ports the
commerce (about £275,000 of imports and
the same of exports in 1924) was modest
enough.

Liberia is a region without railways,
almost without roads, with minerals that are
unworked, rubber and other forests that
are practically untouched, and rich land that
is uncultivated. The navy consists of one
revenue cutter. In the familiar annual list
of the merchant shipping of all countries
the Black Republic isn’t mentioned. The
only bank is a British concern with head-
quarters in London. Away from the coast
the land is greatly given over to cannibalism,
not because the Government, which is mostly
devout Methodist or devoutly Episcopal,
would dream of eating anybody, but because
it lacks the capacity to enforce its good
intentions. No one but a negro landholder
can vote, or can count for anything in poli-
tics.. Such education as exists is mostly
foreign. The Government schools instruct
700 scholars, and the missionary schools
3200. For a population larger than that
of N. S. Wales it is a rather inferior effort.
The country is poor despite its potential
riches, as is evidenced by the fact that, while
it stands on its conservative dignity and
requires a wealth qualification for office, the
qualification for the highest office is the
ownership of £l2O worth of real property.
Extraneous pomp and circumstance are
fairly lavish. Liberia maintains in Great
Britain alone a Minister, a consul-general
and 13 consuls. Considering the revenue
of £140,000 per annum this is a brave show,
but many consuls act merely for the sake of
the uniform, and buy it themselves. There
are two Houses of Parliament, and the
Receiver of Customs and Financial Adviser
is “lent by the United States.” The public
debt (about £450,000) is mostly lent by
Great Britain.
* * * *
Liberia stands in a category by itself.
In many parts of Asia, Africa and America,
likewise in Australia and Maoriland, the
white man shoved certain material advant-
ages of civilisation, such as roads and rail-
ways and drains and medical science, on his
colored relative by more or less benevolent
coercion—in other words, by what a certain
class of alleged thinker describes as “oppres-
sion.” If he hadn’t done so, man’s common
heritage, the globe, might have been a very
narrow, inaccessible and uncultivated place.
Liberia is hemmed in by States where busi-
ness-like white men manage affairs without
any disguise of the fact, and in these places
progress, as represented by roads, railways,
telegraphs, telephones, shipping and com-
merce, hustles along as fast as the steamy
nature of the atmosphere allows. In the
Black Republic the few unofficial and un-
commercial white men can’t do things them-
selves, but they can urge the dominant Ham
to do them—which he doesn’t. If white in-
fluences were wholly withdrawn it is just
possible that Ham would celebrate the 80tli
anniversary of his independence by merging
into tlie surrounding tribes and disappearing
as a po i itica i situation. It is also possible
that Ham of the United States, even -though
he is 104 million strong, might revert to the
ft Va ys of his primitive ancestors if the chance
presented itself. In other words, his civil-
isation may only be gummed on, and the gum
ma y be inferior.
VICTORIA’S BIG CROP OF INSANE.
The recent appointment of Dr. Dawson, of
the Maudsley Hospital (London), to fill the
Chair of Psychiatry at the Sydney Univer-
sity vacated by Sir John McPherson
causes one to glance at Melbourne, to find
that professorial pens have been busy in the
columns of the Medical Journal of Aus-
tralia defending the high status of Mel-
bourne’s medical curriculum. The Mel-
bourne Medical School may have much to
commend it; but the tragic truth is that
the Melbourne University is at present too
poor to purchase a ration of cat’s meat.
Professor Berry, as Dean of the Faculty
of Medicine, who sails this month for
America —there in the guise of Lazarus to
demand dollars from Dives in the interests
of medical research —has frequently pointed
out to the Council his Faculty’s financial
embarrassment. He has exposed the flag-
rant fact that the departments of the Medi-
cal School are meagrely equipped and that
the Faculty, without recourse to the pawn-
broker, is unable to buy books for its library.
Piteous petitions were brought before the
sons of Midas at a recent University dinner
at Menzies’ Hotel by the Chancellor and his
colleagues; but the sons of Midas heard
them not, and the guardians of learning went
sorrowing away. Melbourne’s centre of cul-
ture, therefore, remains down-at-heel; and
the Chair of Psychiatry still waits for en-
dowment.
One of those satiric judgments of fate is
seen in the fact that in Victoria the per-
centage of the insane to population is greater
than in any other State in the Common-
wealth. The number of certified insane in
Victoria is approximately 6000 at the present
day ; and the annual expenditure upon them
is half a million pounds. But the number
of inadequate personalities, mammalian mis-
fits, alcoholics and neurotics, including those
with criminal propensities and those whose
social efficiency is impaired, is only to be
guessed at. That it is large no medical prac-
titioner will deny when he reviews the num-
ber of his patients suffering from “nerves,”
and for whom he is able to do little more
than recommend a sea voyage or a change
of occupation. It is this large and growing
class of “neurotics” —not technically insane,
yet in the soil of whose unstable minds are
sown the seeds which ripen into definite
mental disease in succeeding generations—
which comes prominently into the province
of modern psychiatry.
“To rase the written troubles of the brain”
is the aim of psychiatry; yet some concep-
tion of the mental process is essential for
the correct and comprehensive understand-
ing of every case of sickness, whether of a
medical or surgical character ; for the men-
tality of the patient has a fundamental bear-
ing upon his health. And underlying the
outward manifestations of every disease of
the body, for those who care to investigate,
may be found the motives for conduct and
action and the hidden complexes which may
hold jealously the secrets of health. It
should thus be evident that psychiatry, which
has in the past received from the medical
profession generally little more than con-
tempt, is in reality a basic science which in
general links together all other branches of
medicine. And it follows that not only
should a knowledge of psychiatry be in-
voked as an aid in the diagnosis and treat-
ment of diseases in the general and special
branches of medicine, but also the knowledge
and experience gained by those in other
branches of medicine should be used in the
diagnosis and treatment of the functional
and organic mental disorders themselves.
General medical science coupled with the
now extensive and proven methods of psycho-
analysis and psycho-therapy has already
done much to relieve the sufferings of the
neurasthenic and the hysteric; and with the
insane themselves the outlook grows eve;
more hopeful as research work proceeds and
the facilities for adequate treatment are
obtained.
Hereditary predisposition still plays a
part, in many cases a predominating part,
in the causation of insanity; and as the
majority of the certified insane are enlisted
from the ranks of the poorly endowed in
slum areas and the lower walks of life, the
prophylactic side of psychiatry becomes inti-
mately connected with child welfare, educa-
tional training, public health and housing
conditions. With the spread also of modern
industrial civilisation, and the drift of popu-
lation to the larger cities, the growth of
occupational mental diseases has increased
considerably. Overwork, monotonous machine-
driven routine, in cramped and unhygienic
surroundings, together with alcoholism and
tuberculosis, are responsible for a large
number of the occupational neuroses, and
the amelioration of these conditions there-
fore leads psychiatry into the spheres of
industrial reform and practical politics. The
extended field of female activity, calling for
greater endurance in economic competition,
and putting an extra tax upon the female
at the child-bearing period, has undoubtedly
increased the number of the female insane
in the last few decades. An increase in the
incidence of insanity at the age of adoles-
cence points to an over-education compul-
sorily foisted upon poorly-endowed children,
and again brings the opinions of the psy-
chiatrist to bear upon the problems of edu-
cation.
But Melbourne apparently pays no heed
to these matters. Even among educated
opinion the dynamic impulse to reform malig-
nant conditions is regrettably slight. The
nations of Europe have endowed Chairs of
Psychiatry, and have established clinics in
conjunction with hospitals and universities.
America, too, has her specially-equipped re-
search hospitals; and England boasts a
National Council for Mental Hygiene. Syd-
ney maintains a Chair of Psychiatry and


grants diplomas of Psychological Medicine;
and it has established at Broughton Hall
a psychiatric clinic for in-patients. Even
Brisbane employs the services of a Research
Professor of Medical Psychology. But Mel-
bourne remains mediawal. Her insane popu-
lation is a perpetual burden; her mental
hospitals are woefully overcrowded and
understaffed; she has no Chair of Psy-
chiatry, and gives no adequate instruction or
any practical training in this subject to medical
students. She has no special clinic for in-
patients, nor even a Mental Deficiency Act.
And, unfortunately, until the University
becomes a teaching centre, and establishes
vital connection with the mental hospitals
as clinical schools, those of her graduates
who take up psychiatry must suffer the
popular snub of being “keepers of mad-
houses,” or, in private practice, must tinker
hopelessly with their task.
MELBOURNE MED.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Search for a Safe Seat.
The rumor was sent abroad that the N.S.W.
Premier would be “offered” a Federal con-
stituency, which was taken to mean that
a safe seat would be found for him. Lang,
however, declared his intention to remain
where he is, and possibly no one really
invited him to do anything else. He also
said that similar requests made in the past
had been similarly scorned, but he didn’t
say when they had been made, or by whom.
In reality, “safe” seats for Labor politicians
are far less safe than is sometimes supposed,
unless you can get appointed a Judge. On
Matthew Charlton’s election returns be-
fore he became party leader, even his seat
might be lost by an unpopular candidate.
There is an idea that outside his own little
town, where he is an institution and a
financial agent and alderman of long stand-
ing, Lang might endanger almost any seat.
Theodore had nine years’ continuous
record, first as Treasurer and then as Pre-
mier, when he selected his “safe” Federal con-
stituency ; yet Theodore is more than a pre-
sentable person. One possible difficulty about
an immediate Lang candidature for the Aus-
tralian Parliament is that his colleagues
might make a scandalous fuss about letting
him go. There was never a time in the
State’s history when it seemed perched
so dizzily on the financial brink of some-
thing serious, if not horrible; and if some-
thing serious is to happen, the colleagues
may prefer that it should happen to Lang,
and that he should leave for the Federal
arena afterwards. Otherwise the subsequent
man might get all the blame, as the previous
man, who was Fuller, did for the deficit
of June, 1925. In any case, supposing there
is a promising Federal seat lying about
loose, it is within the bounds of possibility
that McCormack of Queensland may want
it as badly as any other Premier. When
the question of enacting the 44-hour week
turned up among the Communist crowd who
were Theodore’s masters (“Communist” was
Theodore’s own expression), that politician
gave way reluctantly, and then he either
left or was pushed out of the Premiership,
like his predecessor, Ryan. Under the
next wearer of the purple, the weak and
temporary Gillies (1924-25), the railway-
men demonstrated their gratitude by holding
up the railway seiwice to enforce concessions.
The Government surrendered, for discipline
was extinct and the habit of putting up a
fight had gone where the megalosaurus
went, but Gillies fled from worse evil to
come by making himself an Industrial Arbi-
tration Judge. His successor, McCormack,
has done his best to give a colorable imita-
tion of the strong man, and the effort has
been resented in language which almost
sounded like notice to quit. The other day
new trouble began with a demand for a
40-hour week in the building trade, accom-
panied by a threat to declare all. Public
Works jobs in and around the metropolis
“black” to begin with. No one entertains
any great hope that the 40-liour week can
be granted in one trade without becoming
a general demand, or that the trouble, even
if temporarily smothered, won’t break out
again, or that 40 hours will be a definite
stopping-place, the conviction having grown
up that there is somewhere an illimitable
capacity to pay, but that certain people are
sitting tight on the money. So a fourth
consecutive Queensland Premier may be
willing to yield to pressure if offered a
more reliable billet with large remuneration
attached.
P
Red Fool-fury.
The new Laborism, which is honest Labor’s
worst enemy, is giving itself some remark-
able advertisements these days, especially in
N. S. Wales." In the latest instance, a great
roar ■ issued from the Reds of the Sydney
Trades and Labor Council because Garden,
their secretary, hadn’t been named one of the
four employees’ representatives whom the
Bruce Government is sending to the U.S.A.,
along with four members of the Employers’
Federation and two ladies, to study indus-
trial conditions in the U.S.A., and suggest
improvements in the Australian industrial
system should any occur to them. In Aug-
ust last the Government wrote to the Trades
and Labor Councils, the Federation of
Unions and the AW.U. saying that it
intended to select the delegation from nomi-
nations submitted, and asking for three
union nominees from each State. These
conditions w T ere accepted in most instances
(as they were by the employers, for their
part), but the Sydney Trades and Labor
Council behaved with characteristic impu-
dence. It replied, in effect, that it was the
only union organisation that mattered in N.
S. Wales, that Garden was the N.S.W.
nominee and Garden only, and that if
Garden wasn’t chosen the delegation would
be declared “black.” Vast was its astonish-
ment when it learned that Grayndler, the
A.W.U. secretary, and not Garden, would be
the union representative from N. S. Wales,
and that with Grayndler were associated J.
Valentine, engine-driver and president of
the Brisbane Trades and Labor Council; A.
Mclnnes, boilermaker and past president
of the Adelaide Trades and Labor Council ;
and C. J. Munden, S.A. secretary of the
Australasian Society of Engineers. The
baffled Reds announced that the delegation
could consider itself boycotted, both here and
in America. They even sent a man to the
A.W.U. conference at Katoomba to order the
greatest of Australian industrial organisa-
tions to withdraw Grayndler —and were
very properly snubbed for their pains. Their
Garden is, of course, the imported gentleman
who went to Moscow in 1921 as an avowed
Bolshie, and who stood as a Communist can-
didate for the Sydney Parliament in opposi-
tion to Labor in 1925. The Government
would be beneath contempt if it commissioned
such a person to go to America—from which
country, it should be remembered, Saio
latvala, the Communist M.P., was rejected,
even though he was a delegate to a Parlia-
mentary Conference. The brazen attempt to
foist Garden on the taxpayers as a worthy
representative of Australian unionism shows
how poorly furnished with nous are some of
the leaders of the new Lahorism, and how
small is their real regard for “solidarity.”

The Great God Bonus.
When in 1912 Andrew Fisher bestowed £5
and his blessing on every mother in the Com-
monwealth who gave Australia a new citizen,
he probably had some more or less definite
idea in his Scotch head. It was, however,
scarcely characteristic of the national canni-
ness that no provision should have been
made for the delivery of the goods. As it
is, the lady gets her fiver whether she places
on the national altar a live or dead infant.
That fact seems to confuse the issue. What
did Fisher really intend? Were the five
crisp notes from the Federal Treasury meant
as a sort of purchase price for a new live
citizen? A fatherly gift to mother for the
inconvenience she was put to? A post-dated
clearance of the doctor’s fee if there were a
doctor? This vagueness in objective and
unavoidable looseness in distribution is the
curse,of all this sort of dole. It sounds well,
is acceptable to all likely to profit by it, and
means nothing necessarily so far as the wel-
fare of the State is concerned. If it were
intended to eliminate some of the factors,
such as poverty, detrimental to childbirth,
there is not a shred of evidence to show
that it has accomplished that end. A medi-
cal authority declared not long ago that more
women are dying in childbirth to-day than
50 years ago. It is an exaggeration, but
it is true that deaths are far too numerous.
How can the baby bonus affect such a ques-
tion? It is essentially one for pre-natal
clinics and a pi’opaganda of sound teaching.
Giving a mother a fiver after the event
won’t bring to life a baby who would have
lived but for the ignorance and the careless-
ness of the mother. During the past five
years the Federal Government has spent in
round numbers £3,500,000 in these agreeable
fivers. Beyond the confinement resulting in
the birth of a viable child there is practically
no condition imposed, and it is evilly and
scandalously known that people well
circumstanced and in no need of such doles
apply for and obtain them with the cheerful
cynicism that all dole systems breed apace.
A medical authority in Victoria, dealing with
the subject of maternal morbidity, suggested
that in every case of an application for this
bonus the applicant should be called on to
produce “evidence of having received ante-
natal care.” Put into plain English, that
the lady engaged in the citizen-production
business should bring forward some proof
that she has taken reasonable care to ensure
the delivery of the goods. The baby-bonus
is, in short, a fine example of the sort of
legislative article which is produced by the
vague minds of sloppy political idealists. All
such plans are based on visions that are
never brought down to the plane of hard
facts. To ensure with any degree of cer-
tainty that any of these allowances, bonuses
or endowments are actually applied to the
purposes to which the well-meaning vision-
ary glimpses in his dreams they will be
applied would require inquisitorial machinery
that would wreck the financial resources of
any country and turn one half of the com-
munity into Public Service spies on the
other half. That the baby-bonus is a huge
farce, so far as it helps to get more babies,
everyone knows, and it is laughed at. And
however benevolently designed and hedged
about with penalties the proposed family
endowment scheme in N. S. Wales may be, it
will meet with the same fate. Does anyone
believe that because the State pays to mother
an allowance for little Tom, Dick and Harry
none of it will ever find its way into father’s
pocket, and be spent on beer and the ponies?
Or put into something smart for mother at
the bargain sales? Who can check it?

Why Smith Leaves Home.
Dear Bulletin, —So far as I can under-
stand, “S.N.R.” (B. 20/l/’27) is chiefly
concerned with the country-town dweller,
who, he declares, pays 11s. 3d. for his gas,
£2 ss. a week for his four-roomed cottage
and exorbitant prices for his groceries; and
“S.N.R.” doesn’t wonder that the man leaves
for the big city. But what “S.N.R.” does
not say is that the four-roomed cottage is
probably erected on a far larger area of fer-
tile land than its city equivalent, and that
Smith (who may be a bank clerk, a grocer
or a chemist’s assistant), if he is at all enter-
pi-ising. can grow all his vegetables. More-
over, Smith’s travelling expenses to and
fi’om work are nil, whereas the city worker
has to take fares into serious consideration.
Moreover, the downtrodden Smith is unable
to treat himself to expensive nightly enter-
tainments, since his country town can pro-
bably only offer him a cheap picture-show
twice a week. I have lived in many country
towns and found that the people who
drift away are generally city-bred people.
Where the drift really begins is on
the wheat-farms and the orchards and
the slieep-holdings. Which leads me to
“T. Jasper,” who says of the city man
in comparison with his rural brother (B.
20/l/’27) ; “He is more versatile and less
reliable; he is less conservative and more
parasitical, more gregarious and more preda-
tory.” It is relevant to go still further and
say that the conversion of one to the other
must take the generations it took to mould
the diverse characteristics of the two. So
it seems to me like tempting Providence to
deposit a city-bred man of 30 on to a West-
ern wheat-farm and expect him to make a
success of it. In nine cases out of ten he
will hate his life after the first year—-especi-
ally if it has been a bad one. Why is it
that every year dozens of young city men
put in a spell of toil during the harvest, and
vow when it’s over that nothing will induce
them to do it again? Simply because they
weren’t meant for it. One might as well
expect Dave to lead the Russian ballet after
a month’s practice. We hear a great deal
about the failure of returued-soldier land-
settlements. It is not the fault of the Digger
who was a bookmaker’s clerk before the war
that he has failed; it is simply that he is
out of sympathy with his work, and he
has probably believed with the mass of city
people that “going on the land” is the easiest
unskilled profession in the world —and the
most profitable. Some day the city man is
going to understand that his country brothers
are not all millionaires, and that “going on
the land” is not the heritage of the fool of
the family. Wheat-farming and sheep-
breeding in Australia to-day are conducted
on thoroughly scientific lines, and the man
who attempts either in a slipshod manner is
inviting bankruptcy. “5.N.R.,” in the proper
Nat Gould manner, talks about “the spectre
of Mortgage that sits grinning beside him
as he drives his unpaid-for motor-car into
the country town.” It is signally unfair to
blame the country if Smith is foolish enough
to buy a car lie can’t pay for. —Yours, etc.,
Gilbert Mant.

The Menace of Typhoid.
There is more typhoid than usual in N. S.
Wales this summer; and, considering that
typhoid is one of the preventable diseases,
there is always more than there ought to
be. One outbreak occurred in a country
gaol. Another, involving 32 cases, was
reported from a Sydney suburb. In this
instance the milk from one dairy was
blamed, and the premises were closed. The
Sydney milk supply engaged the attention
of a Leg. Assembly select committee in the
last Parliament. Dr. Armstrong, State
Director-General of Public' Health, while
testifying that “practically all the milk that
comes in from the country is pasteurised,”
returned a very emphatic “No” when asked
whether the Sydney supply was “fairly satis-
factory.” J. D. Stewart, Professor of
Veterinary Science at Sydney Uni., stated
that “milk may be dirt-contaminated,
manure-polluted and bacteria-laden, but so
long as it is up to a certain chemical stand-
ard, and its physical character is not notice-
ably altered, it can be sold as pure.” The
witness added that “no improvement has
been made for many years in the distribution
of milk—the article is delivered around Syd-
ney just as it was when I was a boy.” A
doctor in private practice spoke strongly on
this head —“the real danger,” lie said, “comes
after the milk leaves the distributing com-
panies’ depots”—and gave no favorable
account of what he saw on a visit to South
Coast dairying districts. But, apart from
this evidence, nothing came of the inquiry,
nor is it likely that there will be any con-
certed effort to improve the milk supply
until an efficient Greater Sydney Council
arrives. Dr. Purdy, the Metropolitan Health
Officer, periodically points out that, thanks
to enlightened municipal action, the Welling-
ton (M.L.) people get pure milk delivered
at their houses in sealed bottles; but Sydney
is infested with 56 municipalities, so the
adoption of the Wellington system is out of
the question. In the absence of Wellington
methods, Dr. Purdy advises householders to
boil the milk. The same authority insists
in his annual reports that “sewerage exten-
sion has not kept pace with the increase of
population, many large residential areas
being still without the modern facili-
ties and conveniences of a water-carriage sys-
tem of sewerage.” In this respect Lang’s
city lags behind Melbourne. According to
the latest “Commonwealth Year Book,”
Sydney, with 127,009 more people to provide
for, had 170,774 houses connected with the
sewerage system on June 30, 1925, whereas
the Melbourne total on December 30, 1924,
was 187,153. In the course of five years,
21,851 houses were sewered in Sydney, as
against 26,808 in Melbourne. This is a
matter which could, and should, be expedited
by the N. S. Wales Government —and not
in Sydney only, of course. In one way or
another, sewerage works always return divi-
dends, whereas 95 p.c. of the railway and
tramway schemes which occupy most of the
Public Works Committee’s time never will.
If there were more sewerage works there
would assuredly be less typhoid, diarrhoea
and enteritis and other filth diseases. Where
sewerage works are impracticable, the use
of deodorants in w.c.’s, and of blue oil to
kill flies, should be urged upon people in
general, and insisted on in the case of coun-
try hotels and boarding-houses. The sani-
tary arrangements at - such places are too
often abominable.

The Centenary of W.A.
Westralia proposes to celebrate its cen-
tenary in a couple of years’ time; it was on
May 2, 1829, that the Swan River Settle-
ment came into being. Yet Albany is older
than Fremantle or Perth, and Westralia’s
history, as a part of Great Britain, actually
began there two years sooner. The settlers
came from Sydney, not from England, and
Albany could have kept its 100th birthday
last week —on January 21. Perhaps it was
more a military occupation than anything
else, but it deserves commemoration, because
on that day was made the first official claim
of British dominion over the ivliole conti-
nent of Australia. The Imperial Govern-
ment was apprehensive that the French
might secure a footing in the western or
southern coasts, and it had reason to be,
for France had daring navigators and explor-
ers about the high seas. Hence Governor
Darling was directed in 1826 to despatch
expeditions to the other side of the continent
to anticipate the French. The expedition
that was to put Albany on the map left
Sydney in the brig Amity. Major Lockyer,
of the 57th Regiment, was in command, and
those on board numbered about 50 persons,
of whom 23 were convicts and the remainder
mostly soldiers. The Amity reached King
George’s Sound on Christmas Day, 1826,
and the next three weeks were spent in
selecting the site where Albany has stood
ever since. On January 21, 1827, that part
of New Holland which wasn’t already Brit-
isli was duly pegged out for its prospective
owners with the usual pomp and ceremony
of the period—colors run up from a flag-
staff, a royal salute from the brand-new
battery, and a feu-de-joie by the troops. Also,
no doubt, a proclamation was read, and to
impress the joyful event more firmly on
everybody there, an extra allowance of flour,
with raisins and suet, was issued to the con-
victs as well as the troops, and 3001 b. of fish
was hauled up in a sieve-net and given to the
natives for a blow-out. It was a great day
for Albany. A French ship of war had actu-
ally been in the harbor a few weeks sooner;
but the commander had either neglected his
opportunities or France’s zeal to acquire
colonial possessions was over-estimated
by the British statesmen of George IV.’s
day. The settlement in itself was little more
than a penal one, or a garrison, and it had
rather a rough spin through scarcity of sup-
plies before the N. S. Wales authorities
withdrew it when the Swan River settlers
arrived a couple of years later. Major
Lockyer was a Devonshire man, born in
1784; he died at Sydney in 1860. His son,
Nicholas Colston Lockyer, born in 1555,
was Commonwealth Comptroller-General of
Customs from 1911 until his recent retire-
ment ; and he is still doing valuable work
for the Commonwealth in offices that call
for less continuous effort. So the lifetimes
of father and son cover almost the whole
history of Australia, and the entire history
of it as an all-British continent.

Medical Etiquette.
“Speculum.” : To gratify the curiosity of
“C.Q.” and possibly other Bulletineers,
here goes. Medical ethics, as between doc-
tors, have two main principles. (1) Doctors
are bound to share their knowledge. There
must be no “trade secrets.” (2) They are
expected to rely on the judgment and esteem
of their patients and colleagues for such repu-
tations as they may acquire. As a corollary
of the second requirement, it is forbidden
that a medico should criticise his colleague
to any layman or patient, or seek in any
way to profit by his mistakes. Hence the
somewhat elaborate etiquette of the consul-
tation. It would be technically wrong for
a doctor to permit his name to be published
in connection with any case, but in practice
it may be impossible for him to “short
circuit” a grateful patient or an inquisitive
reporter. Where a doctor has the good for-
tune to acquire special skill or knowledge,
or to supply himself with better instruments
than his colleagues possess, it is held that
the good results, if any, that accrue from
them should be sufficient advertisement.
The reasoning may appear obscure to
the average business man, but is none the
worse for that. Medicine is not a business.
To permit free advertisement on commer-
cial lines would be to play into the hands
of those who have more money and influence
than knowledge or technical skill. As a
recent Red Page pointed out, commercial
success is nowadays more a question of
advertisement than intrinsic virtue of goods
or service, and advertisement itself is an
affair of repetition of self-praise. The
present-day boom in unofficial medical pub-
licity may make interesting paragraphs, but
is more likely to mislead than help the sick
reader, and may do the former with disas-
trous results to him. The reporter is very
prone to mix his facts, his judgment is neces-
sarily erratic, and his sense of values often
weird. To stampede a crowd towards a
Bondi surf-queen contest does little harm to
anyone. To set a lot of unfortunate sick
on the trail of an unproved or dud cure may
do untold harm, and will certainly mean a
great waste of money. The only benefits
go to the purveyors of the sensational news
and the useless nostrums.

Ships and Mud and Sundries.
News from the Northern Territory since
it passed under Federal control has mostly
been bad, worse or silly. A recent consign-
ment was mostly in the third category.
There lias been very little shipping at Dar-
win since the Navigation Act was passed,
and, inasmuch as the expulsion of Adminis-
trator Gilruth convinced a revolutionary
mob of mixed breeds and colors that it could
take charge, there is likely to be
less in future. The skipper of the s.s.
Pliysa decided, rightly or wrongly, that
his big ship couldn’t find the requisite
24ft. of water alongside the wharf, and,
there being no lighters, though plenty of
mould and decay, 160 tons of motor-spirit
were carried on to Cairns. An acute short-
age of motor-spirit prevails, so some of the
settlers who bump around in motor vehicles
on the self-made roads will cease bumping
for some time to come. The explanation
given concerning the trouble at the wharf is
that the “accumulated mud there has not been
dredged for many years,” which seems feas-
ible enough. The high-salaried North-Aus-
tralia Commission, which many imagined to
have anchored permanently in Melbourne, has
arrived in the North and has received a call
from the Darwin Town Council. That body
urged the Commission to cease from the
mockery of subsidising, with £ll,OOO a year,
a futile tub to wander to and fro on the
coast, and do some road-making with the
money. It said that, owing to one thing
and another (largely labor troubles, of
course), settlers were being starved out
because supplies failed to arrive, and frozen
out through inability to get their produce
away. In these circumstances it is pleasing
but unimportant to learn that a political
deputation has gone all the way to Oodna-
datta to turn the first sod of the unsatisfac-
tory extension of the unsatisfactory narrow-
gauge railway which reached there in 1891,
and has remained there ever since. Though
a movement is being made to considerably
reduce the long-standing gap in the South-
to-North line, there is utter lack of a definite
promise to fill it up entirely and give the
N.T. that direct connection with the big
southern cities which will put an end to
its isolation. It is a bitter reflection to S.
Australians that a company-something that
could be dealt with by legal process if it
failed to keep its bargain—was ready to do
the work on the land-grant principle, but
Premier Tom Price, not being much of a
business man though a very good stone-
mason, preferred to give a bigger land-
grant to the Commonwealth Government,
and trust to its hono' for the fulfilment of
the bargain. The Territory has since been

the scene of quaint happenings. Desperate
attempts have been made to take the rail-
way out of the Federal area and plant it
in "Queensland. Attempts have also been
made to enlarge the Territory by taking in
bits of adjacent States, as if that would
make up for lack of communication. A
small brigade of officials has been appointed,
and the advent of a preliminary batch was
signalised, as already mentioned, by the
request that the Government would throw its
silly drogher overboard and by the episode
of the mud at the wharf. In the absence of
S. M. Bruce the deputy Prime Minister
has been much occupied of late in trying to
get four employers, four trades union secre-
taries and two ladies off to the U.S. at the
public expense on an industrial inquiry trip,
and this, perhaps, militated against any
sudden activity as regards the matter of a
neglected Fcdei-al estate 523,620 sq. miles
large.
The New Guinea Administration has at last
steeled itself to do what should have been
done months ago, and has taken decisive
action against the villagers who have been
attacking and killing native carriers on the
road from Salamoa to the Bulolo goldfields.
The dilatory and ineffectual methods taken
by the Government to deal with the situa-
tion made the natives aggressive, as is always
the case in such circumstances, and lately
they have gone so far as to threaten parties
under armed white escort. An attempt by
a Government party to arrest the ring-
leaders was met with armed resistance. Then
followed the much-needed lesson. The
natives attacking in force, six of them were
shot, including the headman who is alleged
to be responsible for all the trouble. There
should now be no more attacks on the car-
riers, while the probability of the murder of
the white population has been removed. An
attempt no doubt will be made to try to
make capital out of the shooting; but the
official action will meet with the entire
approval of everyone acquainted with such
situations.
♦
“Morob” : In the sympathy he has been
expressing for the alleged hard lot of the
native woman in the Mandated Territory,
Frank Anstey, M.P., merely exhibits an
amazing lack of knowledge of the conditions
of existence amongst primitive races. In
New Guinea it is the women of the village
who do the work about the place (what
little there is of it) and look after the
yam-patches, simply because from the begin-
ning of time this has been their job, while
the men have attended to the hunting and
fighting. And the Administration which
sought to alter this, or thought it could do
so, would be a supremely fatuous one. The
native woman, it goes without saying,
accepts it as the natural arrangement of
things, and is unable to conceive of any
other system under which she might live.
Were Mr. Anstey to visit the Indian tribes
of the South American interior, the native
peoples of Africa or even the aborigines of
liis own country, he would find the same
system in vogue. Like so many superficial
observers, he makes the mistake of judging
the native woman of New Guinea by the
physical standards applying to the women
of his own race. The New Guinea woman
posessses a stamina and bodily endurance
which make child’s play for her of things
that would kill her white sister; the latter,
for instance, would be utterly incapable of
resuming work a few hours after giving
birth to a child, as the New Guinea woman
frequently does and without suffering any
harm whatever.
To-day, for the first time since we became
famous for merino wool, we find Australian
supremacy seriously threatened. As recent
cables indicate. Bradford is coming to regard
our wool as inferior in quality to that pro-
duced by S. Africa. And the Bradford
people certainly know their business. Clima-
tic conditions have something to do with
the production of superfine wool, but S.
Africa would never have become a serious
competitor if Australia had not, with a
generosity that may, we hope, be rewarded
in Heaven, aided and abetted her sister Domi-
nion. It smacks of shutting the stable-door
after the horse has bolted, but even now it is
not too late to prohibit the exportation of
our best merino strains. Certainly, what-
ever difference of opinion might have existed
15 years ago, when The Bulletin began
to draw attention to the danger, there is
now plenty of proof that S. African competi-
tion must be taken very seriously. Austra-
lia would lose a few thousand pounds each
year through the stoppage of sales of stud
sheep abroad, but it would be money well
lost. To bait a sprat to catch a whale is
good business, but all the best authorities
agree that to sacrifice a whale to win a sprat
is just plain idiocy.

“Der Jong” : As one who can claim
a good deal of personal acquaintance
with the Kaffir, and especially the
Zulu, I should like to traverse some
of “Bildad’s” remarks about the latter.
(B. 13/l/’27). The white man didn’t save
the rest of Kaffir South Africa from destruc-
tion by the Zulus. Finely-organised warriors
as the latter were, their invasions were
repelled more than once by the western
tribes. When the impis attacked Basuto-
land, the Zulu army received such a rough
handling that it thought it better to settle
down and mingle with the local inhabitants
than go back and get what Tchaka kept
in reserve for unsuccessful expeditions. Not
only was the young Zulu forbidden to marry
till he had “washed his spear in blood,” but
he was absolutely barred from approaching
a woman at all unless she belonged to in-
vaded territory. There are people still living
in Natal who can remember what happened
in this regard when Cetewayo’s warriors
crossed into Natal in 1879. After active
service the embargo was relaxed. No Zulu
could marry until he could afford to buy
a wife. In my time that cost anything
from 40 cattle upwards, and 40 cattle take
a lot of getting even nowadays when there
is money to be earned from the white man.
The penalty for infringing this law of
pseudo-chastity was “pegging out” for both.
Theft was punished just as ruthlessly, and
FOWL SLANDER.
MRS. WINEDOT: “Look at that Mrs. Orpington strutting round with her ’brood."
MRS. LEGHORN : “Yes, proud of having such a lot when she ought to be ashamed of
herself. Why, she’s no better than an incubator
cowardice, the greatest crime, was visited
with even more unpleasant penalties. The
result has been that to this day the chastity
of Zulu women and the honesty of the men
are accepted as a matter of course through-
out South Africa. The massacre of the
Natal Boers at Weenen was a dreadful
thing of its kind, but such happenings are
only avoided by a miracle when the terri-
tory occupied and claimed as their own by
a warlike people is invaded by strangers
seeking to possess themselves of land —it
must be remembered in this connection that
the Zulus were, and are, agriculturists and
herdsmen on a large scale. The Boer, with
his Old Testament faith and conviction that
the Lord had made the black man a slave
for ever to His chosen people, was the last
person on earth to establish himself in
the midst of such a community without
giving cause for trouble. This aspect of the
Boer’s character has an important bearing
on the question at issue. No one except a
fanatic would exalt a colored race above his
own, but even a “nigger” is entitled to a
modicum of fair play.
Under the circumstances the most futile
body in Melbourne is the Town-Planning
Commission. The number of reports and
recommendations this committee of experts
makes for politicians to pigeon-hole is over-
whelming. Its latest effort is aimed at pre-
venting overcrowding and its customary
results—bad health and spindly citizens. The
measures proposed include the spreading of
the city over a wider area, the laying down
of arterial roads that will make egress and

bridge, the setting apart of areas tor children
to escape the hoofs of the motor-hog and t c
adoption of a betterment rating system so
that those, who benefit financially by the
commumty s foresight shall help to pay the
bill. Each year that these obvious reforms
are talked on to the shelf increases their
ultimate cost to the ratepayer; but until the
Commission, or some other body, has autho-
rity to carry out its notions, they will
continue to be talked on to the shelf. When
the City Council was asked the other day to
consider the report it promptly turned to the
congenial task of providing more colored
lights for the forthcoming Royal visit.
“Fitzwilliam” : I have been wandering up
and down N. S. Wales lately, and am rapidly
coming to the conclusion that the only people
who object to the newspaper tax are the
proprietors of the Sydney dailies. Most
other people recognise that there has to be
more taxation, anyhow, and they feel it less
in the form of a daily ha’penny. Further-
more, you have the comfortable feeling that
Jones is paying it too; whereas you feel
quite sure that he is dodging the income tax.
It is quite true that the newspaper tax is
a tax on knowledge, but it is a tax on a lot
of other things as well. I defy Mr. Fair-
fax to place his hand on his heart and assert
that there is more than 20 p.c. news in the
make-up of even the S. M. Herald. So far
as the tax upon knowledge goes, my withers
are entirely unwrung by that plea. On the
whole, the tax is like a great deal
of Mr. Lang’s legislation. It is not so much
what he does as what he says that annoys
people, or, rather, the nasty way he says it.
Befoke the war Britain had no General
Staff, as the thing was understood on the
European continent. Officers underwent a
Staff-training course of a minor nature at
the Staff College, Camberley, but after that
their education in Staff work depended largely
on themselves and the opportunities they
had or made. The Imperial Defence College,
recently opened, is part of a scheme to supply
what was shown during the Great Struggle,
particularly in the campaigns of 1915-1(5, to
be a vital necessity. It will enable the
military forces of the Empire to assimilate
a uniform system of Staff work to replace the
unrelated schemes now in existence. Of 30
vacancies in the College 12 will be reserved
for Dominion officers. The naval arm will
be represented, as well as the army and
the air force. Training will be “in the broadest
aspects of strategy,” and will cover every
branch of naval and military activity—ail
very much on the higher planes, of course.
As far as Australia is concerned, the plan
is calculated to give us a sufficiency of first-
class Staff men, and to bring the scattered
defensive units of the Empire together in
the matter of ope harmonious scheme of
training, equipment and organisation.

“Mtjrkaii” : Re wireless v. cable (B.
13/l/’27). A communication system which
can be fished up and snapped or “tapped” by
any world wanderer, such as the Wolf, which
during the war waylaid and sank the
Matunga off the New Guinea coast, is too hap-
hazard. Radio, on the other hand, is attack-
able at the ends only, and these can be
fortified and defended. The fighting nations

now the British radio

ing, it is nowadays
practically impossible
to prevent stations

cause a ripple of

graphic circles. The
fact that the use of

sal proves this state-
ment to be sheer non-
sense. The cable is
all right for Billy

altogether too slender a thread to hang a
possible life-or-death message on.
“Bad Australian” : “0.E.J.,” writing
from Spain, says that the Spaniards
claim that Colon was a Spanish and
not an Italian name, and that Colum-
bus always called himself Colon, never
mentioned Italy or spoke or wrote Italian,
and so on (B. 6/l/'27). But he cites no
authorities. I can give some weighty ones
on the other side. Bartolome Las Casas,
first Bishop of Chiapa, in the Spanish Indies,
says positively that the great navigatbr was
a Genoese, and that he was known as Cris-
tobal Colombo de Terra Rubia until well
advanced in life. His brother Bartolome
is also referred to as of Terra Rubia. Else-
where Las Casas says that Columbus was
eloquent and expert in the Latin tongue but
somewhat awkward and stilted in Spanish.
The Portuguese historian, Juan de Barros,
a contemporary of Las Casas, states in his
work entitled “Asia” that Columbus was a
native of Genoa, where his people lived by
faring oversea with merchandise of the coun-
try. Las Casas cites various letters
addressed to the Spanish sovereigns by
Columbus relative to the mutiny fomented
by Francisco Roldan, one of his alcaldes
in San Domingo, in which he complains that
the Spanish colonists, instigated by his
enemies, seize every opportunity of showing
their envy and hatred of him, “a poor stran-
ger.” Las Casas’s father and uncle were
with Columbus on his first voyage to
America, and the historian himself, who
spent a great part of a long life in the
Indies, was intimately acquainted with the
navigator’s family.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It is likely enough that Minister Badly
gave notice of the N.S.W. Child Endowment
Bill as a mere matter of form and to show
that he hadn’t forgotten the nightmare thing.
He did it crudely enough, his description
being “a bill to make provision for the
benefit of children of employees by the pay-
ment of family endowment out of contribu-
tions by employers to the consolidated revenue
fund.” Of course the details can be filled
in—provided Badly and his colleagues, know
how. The same might be said if the Minister
had led off with a bill to provide for the
children of Congregationalists out of con-
tributions from Presbyterians.
N.S.W. Attorney-General McTiernan has
been away on another “mission” —this time
to beg somebody in Melbourne to tell them
that the Lang Government’s child endow-
ment scheme is unconstitutional. If it. can
be proved that child endowment is within
the power of the Federal authorities only,
it will be a blessed relief to McTiernan and
all his harassed colleagues; but it doesn’t
seem a provable case. One point raised is
that many wage-earners work under Federal
awards, but why it should be unconsti-
tutional to give a present of either money
or beer to a man working under a Federal
award is not easy to say offhand.
It is estimated that the N.S.W. child-
endowment scheme conld be made applicable
to all except the affluent for a little over
£11,060,000 a year. The Lang Government
proposed to keep the figure down to
£7,000,000 by disqualifying all save the
children of wage-earners in receipt of less
than £5OO per annum, though when one con-
siders the “settlers” on pocket-handkerchief
allotments at French’s Forest, who try to
live by selling hot water to Sunday pic-
nickers, it is evident that there are other
deserving cases. The difference between;
seven and eleven gives a rough idea of the
proportion of the population which would
dislike the Lang Government very much by
reason of its endowment scheme if carried
out in its crude state, to say nothing of
other causes of loathing.
So desperate is the condition of Lang
finance that unclaimed tote divs., which
amounted to a mere £4214 on metropolitan
courses last year, are to be pouched by the
Government. Hitherto this money has been
handed by the A.J.O. and other clubs to
charity—in 1024-25, for instance, the amount
so distributed by the controlling body was
jnst under £l2OO. But, then, the A.J.C. is
not suspected of devotion to Lang, and the
chance of scoring off it is too mean to be
missed.
Won’t somebody cable to the hard-headed
unions of the U.S.A. that Jock Garden, the
gentleman who is making all the fuss over
the Industrial Delegation, is an ex-parson
and quite unconnected with industry except
for helping to stop it?
Brief mention in the press:—
Owing to the reduction in the estimates the
Defence Department has been left so short of money
that the Third Division is not even able to pay the
train fares of permanent soldiers. The Third Division
embraces Melbourne and practically the whole of
Victoria. The training of the citizen forces will be
seriously hampered, as .all movements of troops en-
tailing expense must be cut out.
The Prime Minister is moving round the
world with a retinue, and the North Aus-
tralian Commission has moved successfully
as far as Darwin, and 10 industrial dele-
gates are to move to, and all over, the U.S.,
all at the public expense; but the citizen
forces can’t even move to their training-
camp.
The Federal Bill providing Australia with
a uniform bankruptcy system became law
on October 8, 1924, and “steps” are now
being taken to put it in force. The first
step is to create the office of Inspector-
General in Bankruptcy, and after the man
is found and the premises and furniture
and stationery acquired in the different
States, and the staffs and the courts and
some tons of regulations, things may begin
to move. Then perhaps uniform marriage
and divorce arrangements may be considered
along with a few other sundries; but there
are no signs of haste.
On the motion of a Labor alderman, a
Sydney hotel, recently resumed by the
delightful City Council, which paid compen-
sation on the basis of “a fair rental value of
£9O a week,” is to be leased for six years to
a person who chanced to be the only tenderer,
at £45 a week. It is one of those transac-
tions for which the City Council is distin-
guished, the only question being whether the
late owner or the new lessee has been pre-
sented Avitli a fortune.
The Vic. Itailway Commissioners were
denounced the other day for “militarism” in
issuing long-service stripes to officers, the
denouncer being sec. of the local branch of
the Railway Union. In the same breath,
or nearly the same breath, the gentleman
hinted that direct action would be resorted
to if the department didn't abolish promotion
for efficiency instead of seniority. The mili-
tant unions, he observed, always got what
they wanted in Australia. Mr. Sear's hatred
of “militarism” seems to be subject to excep-
tions.
Before going from Adelaide to Oodnadatta,
where the first sod of the railway to Alice
Springs was turned on Friday, S. Aus.
Attorney-General Denny typed a bit of secret
history for the Advertiser. The transfer of
the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth
was arranged with Alfred Deakin by Tom
Price, then State Premier, and Larry
O’Louglilin. Those worthies, their junior col-
league records, “made it clear that it was
permissible, if the Commonwealth so de-
sired, for the North-South line to deviate
THE PASSION FOR ECONOMY.
“The yearly reduction by Parliament of the estimates for the Australian Military Forces prepared
by Inspector-General Chauvel has this year left the Department so short of money that now the 3rd
Division is not able even to pay the train fares of the permanent soldiers.”
THE PARLIAMENTARY PERSON: “'Eve’s another bright idea, Sir ’Arry - ’ow about
crossin ’ the rifles with boomerangs so’s the bullets would come back in case
of a miss.”
through Queensland.” But the Northern
Territory Acceptance Act, which was drafted
by P. M. Glynn, Deakin’s Attorney-General
from Angas (S.A.), “did not permit of such
deviation.” So South Aus. owes something
to Glynn, as well as to John Gunn, who per-
suaded Bruce to undertake the job now be-
ginning. Still, having handed over an estate
covering 523,620 sq. miles, and waited 16
years for work to start on the southern frag-
ment of a 3ft. 6in. line, the State didn’t feel
like joining in the rhapsodies of the poli-
ticians at Oodnadatta.
There are now five non-Labor parties in
Vic., and Labor is contemplating the quin-
tette cynically. The Nat. Feds, and the
A.W.N.L. usually get on pretty well to-
gether, but there must be some rift in the
lute, as Mrs. Crocker, head of the Leaguers,
lias resigned. The New Lib. party is making
no headway, but the dailies are giving it a
show, it being the silly season. The Country
Progressives are rivals of the Farmers’ Union,
and take themselves very seriously. The
Allancocks are trying to promote a “good
understanding” among the five, but the neces-
sary leadership is lacking.
Mexico is the world’s second greatest oil
producer, and much U.S. capital is invested
there. The Greasers have a general impres-
sion that there is too much, or, rather, that
it takes away too much profit. They have
also an idea that foreign capital runs their
politics, and that the President who refuses
to grant more concessions to U.S. companies
comes to a bad end. The details of the newest
mix-up haven’t transpired, but some new
regulations have been made, and it is
announced that all the U.S. oil companies
propose to proceed against the Mexican Gov-
ernment for a bushel of injunctions if the
matter goes any further. Suppose the Mexi-
can court says its Government is in the right,
there is always the chance of a demand for
“direct action.” It is not all beer and
skittles to have foreign capital invested in a
country. Mexico was once nearly twice its
present size, but the foreign capitalist got
away with a good deal of it.
The Australian meat trade has been
cheered by the news that the huge tinned-
beef contract for the British Army lias gone
to the Argentine. A. R. Ilassan, who repre-
sents the Australian Meat Council in Lon-
don, says that the success of the South
American trade is due “purely to organisa-
tion and militant marketing,” and lie re-
proaches the Australian trade for not adopt-
ing similar methods. But in Argentina the
Government recognises the tremendous value
of the industry to the State, and fosters it
in every way. In Australia such States as
Queensland have bled the industry white
with taxes, and have hobbled it with insup-
portable labor and lease conditions and rents,
and with inept rail transport.
Alleging that its patent rights are being
infringed on a large scale, Amalgamated
Wireless, in which the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment holds a controlling interest, is
claiming substantial royalties from the trade
on valves used in receiving-sets. The situa-
tion recalls a difficulty in which gold-
mining cos. found themselves 27 years ago
with respect to the use of the cyanide
patents. In Victoria the McLean Govern-
ment stepped in and bought the rights for
£20,000, the purchase involving the cessa-
• tion of threatened lawsuits. Those using the
cyanide process were charged from 3A to 24 per
cent, on the value of gold and silver treated;
in five years and nine months the £20,000
was collected, and then everybody was free
to use the process. Outtrim was the Min-
ister who fixed up the arrangement, and
everybody was pleased when he piloted
his bill through. The precedent should inter-
est the Bruce-Page Government, which is
making the usual vague references to a Royal
Commission.
The destruction of the bonus system in the
N.S.W. Government railway workshops is
aimed at in a Railway Bill now on the
stocks. The system has vastly reduced the
cost of production in some of the shops and
enabled thousands of good workers to add
materially to their wages; but Red union
officials, inferior workmen and go-slowers
object, so away it goes. The Government
brickyards, one of the few Australian State
undertakings which haven’t reached the
bankruptcy stage, have a profit-sharing sys-
tem, the employees dividing £9OOO or £lO,OOO
a year, which puts about 9 p.c. on to their
wages. This experiment, the management
says, and the Auditor-General agrees, “is
in a considerable degree responsible for the
success of the undertaking.”
The mob in office in the Ma State, while
doing itself extremely well in the matter of
free automobiling—£Bsoo was spent on the
Ministerial service last year—hates to think
that other people ride in motor-cars and
-'buses. Witness its decision to misappro-
priate £488,000 from the funds of the Main
Roads Board, in repudiation of an Act of
Parliament which provides that “the taxa-
tion raised on motor vehicles, less the cost of
collection, shall be set aside for main-road
purposes,” and to correspondingly reduce the
current deficit caused by the 44-hour week
and other concessions to Government sup-
porters. In the same strafing spirit, it was
proposed in a bill introduced last week to
place “all transport vehicles which enter into
competition with the Government railways
and tramways” under the control of “a per-
manent commission consisting of the Rail-
way Commissioners,” who have made it
abundantly clear that they would like to
wipe all such vehicles off the roads. But
the opposition was such that the Govern-
ment’s heart sank to its boots, and it hur-
riedly decided on “an independent board.”
“H.P.”: Rc the objection of certain N.S.W.
unions or union-bosses to promotion by merit
and their insistence on promotion by senior-
ity. It does seem absurd, doesn’t it? But
it isn’t the fault of the unionists so much
as of their bosses. It is the method of
discovering the merit that repels. In my
particular occupation I have found that
almost every man promoted has some other
qualifications than ability to do his work.
Promotion by seniority is a clumsy method.
But it seems to be the only way to combat
favoritism.
The minimum requirement of seven hours
per diem is stated to be fulfilled by the
beam-wireless installation, and at the tall
speeds now in fashion sufficient business
should be done to justify the expenditure of
the taxpayer’s money. But the chief value
of the beam to the public up to date has
been in stirring the cablemen out of their
lethargy. A new device for speeding up sub-
marine messages between England and this
country will shortly be applied, and curi-
ously enough it reverts in principle to an
old, discarded method invented by the late
Lord Kelvin. It will cut out intermediate
relaying and enable Sydney to talk to
London direct.
From “The Unreformed House of Com-
mons” (page 340) :
In the reign of George 111., and until the Reform
Act cut so many nomination boroughs out of the
Electoral System, it was usual for Administrations,
Tory or Whig, to go into the market and purchase
the right to nominate members for a Parliament.
North’s transactions in boroughs at the general
election of 1774 illustrate the business. “Lord Fal-
mouth,” wrote North to Cooper, “must be told in as
polite terms as possible that I hope he will permit
me to recommend to three of his six seats in Corn-
wall. The terms he expects are £2500 a seat, to
which I readily agree.”
Seven thousand five hundred the lot. There
is nothing new under the sun. Mr. Kay
will cost the Meat Board or the producers
of meat £7500 in salary for five years. True,
in return, the Lang Government got only
one seat, not three.
The Russian Navy has found it out, too.
Officially there are no officers, but, having
found some difficulty in running a navy on
lines of strict equality, a “commanding per-
sonnel” has been introduced, this being the
same brand of dog with a different name.
The one-man trams installed on the Glen-
huntly run, near Melbourne, soon struck
trouble, the drivers declaring that the dead-
man’s stop is not infallible. Of course it
isn’t, nor is the two-men system. But the
safety-applianced one-man car has been tried
at Ballarat and Geelong and in dozens of
towns in the U.S.A. and been found satis-
factory, so there may be something in the
rumor that the real objection is the foolish
prejudice against one man doing a job on
which two can possibly be crowded.
THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There was an old woman
Who lived in a shoe.
She had so many children
She didn’t know what to do. '
.So she put on her bonnet
And went to seek
Advice from somebody clever;
He promised each kid
Six bob a week—
And soon she had more kids than ever.

It isn’t a record to provoke enthusiasm. In
1920, the apex of the post-war boom, the
board placed the profit—or what looked like
the profit—at £309,562. In the following
year prices flopped, and £300,000 had to be
written off. By 1923 conditions had recov-
ered, but there has been no doubt as to the
trend over the past three years. For the
12 months ended July 19 net earnings just
comfortably covered pref. requirements; the
surplus represented little more than 1 p.c.
on ords. The directors handed out 5 p.c.,
half of the distribution being paid from
undisclosed reserves. It is pleasant for
shareholders to receive a div. when the
wherewithal from current profits isn’t
visible. It tells, too, of optimism on the
part of the directors in the face of the last
four chapters of the introductory table.
Certainly they explain that a special adverse
circumstance was at work last year—
that “the drop in the amount of net
profit has to a very great degree been con-
sequent upon an extraordinary discounting
of the stock of the Melbourne house,” which
the new management considered necessary.
In any case, the public is interested only in the
prefs., though with margins narrowing pref.-
holders will naturally want to see that any
reserve strength on the premises is cold-
stored. This Column has remarked more
than once on the diminishing importance of
the wholesale softgoods importer—a definite
economic development in Australia of recent
years. The effect is disclosed in the number
of deaths, disablements and absorptions
among the Flinders-lane and York-street
houses, the latest being the Sargood-Gardiner
amalgamation. Conditions in “the Lane”
and York-street are said to have improved
in the past few months, and prospects are
considered bright. But optimism based on
-improvement over merely a portion of a
year is ill-based. The few shareholders who
turned up at the annual meeting were in-
formed that the directors hoped to revert
to a 10 p.c. disbursement to ords. in the
present year. The forecast may be con-
firmed, but the strong growth of the ten-
dencies which have caused trouble in recent
years is a factor which may disturb the
happy anticipation.
Stocks were £183,729 lighter than at the
previous balance, partly the result of the
writing-down at the Melbourne end. Gen-
erally speaking, balance-sheet movements
were favorable. Although trade debts
were somewhat heavier, overdrafts and
deposits were lighter, liabilities totalling in
all £687,704 compared with £717,911. Book
debts were greater by £140,272, which sug-
gests a bigger and more rapid turnover. If
the management concentrates on that, and
continues to closely watch overhead, the
10 p.c. forecast may be justified. Slow turn-
over and excessive overhead have been the
two profit-killing features of most importing
houses in the past. Meantime pref.-holders
in this co. can see the following security:—

There is £150,000 of 6 p.c. mortgage deben-
ture stock, and, after providing for that
(and interest accrued), all other liabilities
and the first prefs., there was £813,394 more
or less liquid to cover the quarter-million
of second prefs., equal to £3 ss. Id. for each
share. There is a pension reserve of £57,317 :
it has not been included with liabilities of
the table. There is also a plant and fixtures
depreciation fund which has grown to
£33,686, and although fixtures have appa-
rently been written down out of profits, the
amount is not included with reserves. Inci-
dentally £B5l of sundries was lumped with
pref. divs.; the directors certainly should
have added a few words of explanation. The
£200,000 of first prefs. carry 7 p.c. They
keep around 215., which represents 6.6 p.c.
to buyers. The market values the 8 per
cents, at Is. to Is. 6d. higher.

Twelve months ago the Wild Cat pointed
out that too much should not be expected
from 1926 on account of the co.’s big move
from its lialf-century-old home in Market-
street to the imposing building facing Hyde
Park. Latest accounts bear the impress of
the expensive change-over which was made
in the first half of the term; and there have
been, in addition, other money-eating factors.
Needless to say, in the- clearing up a quantity
of junk was found on the old premises, and
this, plus the necessities forced on every
paper by the razor-keen competition, de-
manded a clean sweep. The change-over must
have cost a lot of money. Visibly, all that
happened was that plant replacement reserve
was drawn on for £16,552 for new machinery,
and the directors report that it was found
necessary to spend an extra £6517 on one of
the subsidiary papers—“which lias been writ-
ten off the year’s profits.” It is a sign of
the times that such a fat addition to ordinary
expenditure had to be made. So far as S.
Bennett and other newspaper cos. are con-
cerned the extraordinary is to a great extent
likely to become the ordinary. Still, in the
circumstances, last year cannot be considered
normal; and, given a continuance of good
conditions of trade generally, better figures
should now be shown. The directors, more-
over, report further progress in circulation
and advertising revenue. That, of course,
was before the newspaper tax arrived. What
effect that tax will have is problematical.
Balance-sheet movements were substantial:

*Goodwill, £62,000, although undisclosed in those
years, has been deducted from 1922 and 1924 figures.
The amount of capital uncalled at the close
of the accounts was £52,750. Liabilities
appear rather unwieldy, and shareholders
will not object if the balance of capital is
called. Liabilities might with advantage be
itemised, or at least the amount of fixed debt
shown. The taking over of the new building
was the principal cause of the growth of
£lOO,OOO-odd in the creditor item. Just how
much of the total is mortgage and whether
the bank is assisting is news that is not
likely to be released for publication. What
is visible is the big amount, and no harm will
be done when it is reduced. A solid wad of
capital was idle for part of the year, and the
daily and its two assistants have a by no
means light load to carry in the new build-
ing. Still on the earnings for the term the
co. should be able to handle its problems
with ease. The 8 p.c. div. on the increased
capital was quite a simple matter. The
market is almost enthusiastic about the scrip,
despite (or perhaps because of) the present
moderate rate, and tb,e fully-paids keep
around 325. 6d., which represents a yield of
less than 5 p.c.

Gross earnings showed decided improvement:’
profit from coal was £63,631 as against
£56,378 for the previous year, and from
“steamer, hulks, depots, etc.,” £25,102 com-
pared with £24,827. But administrative exes,
and general charges also moved, being £9500'
greater. The directors had nothing to say
on the matter, though such an increase war-
ranted at least a few words. Just as the
report is uncommunicative so the balance-
sheet is a secretive and confused-looking
document. These figures nevertheless show
a very solid position :
1924. 1925. 1926.
More or less liquid assets £5>51,876 £563,301 £581,773
Liabilities . . .. 233,588 233,880 258,380
Surplus £318,288 £329,481 £323,393
Property .. .. 273,824 280,094 291,974
But it is impossible to judge exactly the
value of those figures. There is. for in-
stance, a sinking fund of £123,750. It is
included in the liquids of the table. A
memo, to the accounts gives the amount as
“paid to trustees,” and shows £64,115 as
interest paid and accrued —£187,865 in all.
In the liabilities column is an insurance fund
of £128,460 (in the previous year it was
exactly the same amount as the sinking
fund). The interest earned is still un-
accounted for, unless it forms part of sundry
liabilities on the one side and loans and
investments on the other. Certainly the
creditor item of £258,380 is far too hefty to
be accepted without suspicion, and loans and
investments of £299.597 is a rich assets
item for a coal co. Whatever the exact posi-
tion the figures imply greater strength than
is disclosed, and, as the co.’s history for the
past quarter-century has been favorable, with
good average divs., the market thinks the
very best.
Westport has interests other than its
deposit of good coal on the West Coat. It
is interested in coke-making, and there are
other fixed assets. Writing down has in the
past been on a liberal scale, and the fact that
property account went up last year by a
net £ll,BBl suggests that the expansion was
fairly substantial, for with a prosperous year
the management is not likely to have dimin-
ished the allowance for wear and tear apart
from the provision made through the insur-
ance fund. The co.’s investments assist to
insure good divs. to shareholders, although
the 12i p.c. cannot yet be looked upon as a
habit. Improving reserves make the task
easier, and the fact that the co. is providing
against the day when its coal will have been
worked out is a fact which the market duly
recognises. Shares are keenly sought at
375. 6d.

The directors decided on a bonus issue
and shareholders have collected one for five;
the new shares rank for divs. as from the
beginning of the present term. It was a
pleasant addition to the lli P-C-, particularly
since, on present appearances, the old div.
rate can be maintained. “Specific reserves”
(unaltered at £53.425) are included in the
total of the introductory table. In the big
watering of six years ago specific reserves
were swallowed, and everything points to
the amount since accumulated being of the
same quality as formerly. After payment
of the final div. for last year, almost £lO,OOO
was added to reserves; on many occasions
the lay-by has been greater than the amount
distributed. Trade during the 12 months
was satisfactory. The co.’s new fibre box
is winning a market, but the Tariff Board’s
recommendation of a higher duty on wood
cut to sizes for assembling into cases is
held in abeyance, and until it is applied this
co.’s all-Australian fibre-boxes will have a
strong competitor. Fielding’s was assisted
last year by the competition between the
paper-board mills. With the amalgamation
of the two big concerns, the price-cutting
has disappeared. This may remove some of
the advantage the co. has had in the matter
of raw-material costs; whether sufficient to
make a noticeable impression on earnings is
to be doubted.
The following figures show how the undi-
vided profits have expanded the business,
which throughout has been very well handled :
1914. 1919. 1925. 1926.

Book debts, cash
and investments 4709 19,778 72,316 96,133
The position at September 30 was very
solid: outside liabilities were more than
covered by cash alone. Of the paid capital of
£122,500, and allowing cover for creditor
items, all but £B7Bl was represented by
assets more or less liquid, with premises and
plant in at what appears to be a conserva-
tive £108,603. With tangible assets on view
equal to a liet 355. for every share, with
handsome divs., with the latest gift and
possibilities, it is not surprising that buyers
are prepared to pay 465. 6d. for any shares
available.
The Red Funnel Fisheries, Ltd., com-
menced business in December, 1925, taking
over the trawling business of D. P. Hann,
including two vessels, for £27,750 in paids,
and the business of the New State Fish and
Ice Co., Ltd., including the lease of a wharf,
for £7250 paids. To finance the purchase
of three more trawlers, the public was offered
£40,000 in £1 shares. The original idea
was to buy the vessels in England, but
developments here resulted in the purchase
of Carlyon’s business, and that included a
lease of the State depot at Newcastle and
a trawler. In June another vessel was
bought, and the assets of Coastal Trawlers,
Ltd., were taken over in October, thus
making a fleet of six vessels, and giving the
co. control of the trawling business on the
N. •S. Wales coast. Nominal capital was
then advanced. to £175,000 in £1 shares, of
which 62,116 were paid to £57,389 at Novem-
ber 30.
The co. put up a very creditable perform-
ance for its first year, which ended Novem-
ber 30. The auditor certifies to profits equal
to 194 p.c. of the average capital employed
after making all necessary provision for
depreciation and taxation. The accounts
show £1245 written off leases, etc., buildings
and preliminary exes., and £2200 put by for
taxation. That left a balance of £8877, but
whether it is all true profit depends upon
the amount, if any, that was deducted
from gross profits to meet depreciation of
vessels and gear, in the books at £83,630,
and subject to a mortgage of £34,194. The
accounts are not at all clear on that impor-
tant matter, and they should be. None of
the vessels in the co.’s fleet are under six
years old, and wear and tear is heavy.
Sundry creditors were owed £7491, and there
was £9681 in stocks, books debts and cash
to meet the debt. The co.’s prospects for
the current year are very good. Competi-
tion has largely disappeared, the co. does
its own marketing, the demand is good and
growing, and the inedible catch is now sold
to a fertiliser co. At the close of accounts
there were net assets of 215., nearly all of
it in ships, for each £1 of capital paid up.
The chairman says the scrip is to be listed
when the sale of capital stock ceases. In-
vestors, however, would like something more
definite about the ships.

Gehrig’s Wines, Ltd. —This co. is being
formed to take over the old-established wine
and spirit business of Gehrig and Co. Nomi-
nal capital is £150,000 in £1 shares; 58,000
10 p.c. cum. prefs. and the balance in ords.
All the prefs. are offered; they carry prior
capital rights and advance with ords. in any
div. the latter receive beyond 10 p.c. p.a. The
vendor takes 17,000 paids and £36,000 for the
old business —£23,137 for goodwill, contracts
and agencies (the latter, by the way, not
enumerated) and £29,863 for tangibles, thus
leaving £22,000 for working capital, with
75,000 ords. in reserve. The tangibles com-
prise freehold, £2590; plant, etc., £2523;
30,000 gallons of wine, £9000; and two lease-
holds (wineshops), which expire in 1932,
£15,750. The idea is to build a modern
winery in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area,
establish agencies in other States and gener-
ally expand the business. No doubt the
£22,000 is sufficient for those purposes, but
estimated outlay should have been itemised.
Turnover for the first year is estimated at
£54,000 and net profit at £15,500, or about
24 times pref. requirements on the full issue.
The earnings of the vendors’ business are not
stated; and they should be. That they have
won championship awards in Australia for
sherry for the past eight years in succession,
and that two of the Gehrigs are on the board,
which also includes W. M. Westphal, a judge
of wines, is distinctly to the new co.’s advan-
tage. The auditors certify to net profits of
£6136 for the year 1926 from the two city
(Sydney) leasehold businesses. There are
two other saloons tied to the vendor firm,
and the co. has the right to take over the
securities, but it is doubtful whether there
is much to be gained by exercising that right.
When the issue is fully subscribed and paid
the prefs. will have a net tangible backing of
17s. lOd. per £1 share, subject to formation

The‘oil cos. operating in Australia are all
quiet these days. . S.A. Oil Weils sends out
a regular coininuniQUG, but talk of a now is
no longer heard. The Bs. 6d. quotation of
November is, like the rumpus which followed
it only an echo; there are sellers now at
3s A‘band of optimists is prepared to have
another go at Roma (Q-) and lias leased
from the receiver appointed by the debenture
holders the drilling plant and equipment of
the Lander Co. The consideration accepted
by the deb.-holders is f.-p. shares in the new
co. Following negotiations between the
Aiiglo-Persian and Taranaki, two of the big
cos.’ leading geologists are now examining
the territories over which the Anglo-Persian
holds an option. A third geologist is due.
At the co.’s Waiapu No. 2 bore site the rig

The subscription by the Anglo-American
Corporation of 50,000 shares in Mt. Isa
mines at par, and the option over a further
550,000 shares, gave strength to the market,
and heavy buying by London sent prices
soaring. How many shares changed hands
nobody knows; probably 50,000 have been
sucked up by London since November. In
addition, scrip available in London also was
lifted. Local purchases were not important.
Prices in London touched 365.; there were
sales locally on Monday at 345. 6d. In
November last the scrip could be picked up
at 16s. The closing sale in December was at
225. Od.

A wholesale resurrection of the dead is
being attempted by means of boring at Cool-

failure bores will be put elsewhere. Mean-
while local optimists have polished up their
rose-tinted spectacles.

A doleful tale was told by chairman Buck-
nail at the Horseshoe meeting in London. As
the funds of the co. admitted of no more
losses being incurred, £50,000 in two equal
amounts of £25,000 had been borrowed from
the State Government. The Government
declined further assistance when this amount
disappeared, and the mine was closed down.
Later on the board heard that capital would
probably be available in Australia, and sent
Protheroe .Tones to sift the possibilities in
Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne. He found,
however, that, while there was every readi-
ness to discuss, wool and wheat, mining in
Westralia was considered a thing of the past
unless the Government gave a substantial
bonus on gold production. The State Premier
made no offer of further financial assistance,
but .Tones understood that so long as the
interest on the mortgage was paid regularly
and the mine kept free of water the Govern-
ment would not take any measures to fore-
close. With a more exacting clean-up of the
accumulation of gold in the plant over the past
2 1 years, the manager had been able to find
funds to carry out these latter conditions,
but that source of income would be exhausted
b^ T the middle of January. The chairman
added that unless further financial assist-
ance from the Government was forthcoming
the only thing left for the co. was to wind
up.

H. W. Gepp. chairman of the Develop-
ment and Migration Commission, bluntly
told a meeting of London representatives of
Westralian goldmining cos. recently that all
the Ivalgoorlie mines should be amalgamated,
lie said that if and when this was done, he
might recommend the Federal Government
to send an American geologist to carry out
such diamond-drilling work as would enable
the Commission to report as to the future
of the field. Such a report in turn would
enable the Government to decide whether
anything more should be done to retain the
attenuated population in Ivalgoorlie or let
it be quietly absorbed in other parts of Aus-
tralia. According to Gepp, Bruce is opposed
to any bounty for the production of gold
on the ground that it is economically
unsound.

Dr. Edwards (director), who inspected
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) last year,
smites a former management in a report just
to hand. He says: “Wanton destruction
and neglect of the old co.’s assets took place
during the liquidation period. The working
of the mine as a large-tonnage low-grade
proposition was a blunder, and the failure of
this policy resulted in the handing over of
the property to tributors instead of the co.
being reconstructed and working the mine
itself. The co.’s officials were interested in
tributes, and the treatment plant was re-
arranged to treat tributors’ ore only. The
remainder of the plant was either sold at absurd
scrap prices or allowed to rot in situ. The
underground workings were dealt with in the
same manner. The underground workings
have since been put in better shape and the
plant patched up. Treatment costs, however,
continue high, largely on account of most
of the plant being obsolete.” Edwards adds
that new plant of the latest design must
be obtained. The co. was willing to erect
a flotation plant of 200 tons per diem capa-
city and run it for a year, provided it got
a Government grant of £20,000 to cover capi-
tal cost, such grant to be repayable over the
period if the process was an economic suc-
cess. The Westralian Government is con-
sidering this proposal, but, as in the case of
the Horseshoe, it will probably await the
report of the Development and Migration
Commission’s technical committee before
doing anything.

Main-shaft sinking below No. 4 level at
the Brilliant. Yalgoo (W.A.), has been slow,
only 20ft. of new sinking having been done
below the level. Certainly, conditions for
sinking are not good at the Brilliant, which,
together with the fact that the last 380
tons treated yielded only 1820 z., makes the
prospect of dividends remote.

London will take a hand in the Braeside
silver-lead mines in Nor’-Westralia provided
good results are disclosed by the work at
depth which the Braeside directors propose
to put in hand immediately. The shaft will
be deepened to 136 feet, and from this point
the lode will be exposed from wall to wall
and a crosscut extended east a distance of
60ft. in order to expose a silver-lead deposit
known to exist on the surface that distance
east of the main ore body.

Adelong Creek (N.S.W.) last half-year
(to November 30) made a net profit of £785,
against £2036 for the May period. Bullion
at £7809 showed a revenue of just over BM.
per yard, against the previous return of
9.lGd. Working exes, at £5924 were on
almost the previous basis of 6|d. per yd.
Outside liabilities were only £566 against
liquid assets of £5475, including £3685 in
stores, £1386 in cash and £404 in gold
values. The output was affected by an over-
burden of stiff black clay, which had to be
stripped off. The co. lias paid 9s. in divs.

Queensland Tin, N.Q. Rare Metals,
Queensland Antimony and Tanami Gold

stages most of them had a hectic run on
’Change, and somebody must have got his
fingers burned. The Rare Metals Co.
announces that its crushing stage approaches ;
and Antimony, which should have completed
its plant several months ago, may be heard
from soon. Meantime interest in Pitt-street

Guinea Gold, a Bulolo concern, gives
details of development work as reported by
field-engineer J. C. Coldham. A three-mile
race to work the Kaili section is nearly com-
pleted. Prospecting shafts are showing con-
centration with depth, and the aggregate
yardage on Ivoranga Creek is “considerable” ;
but as the patches are scattered an accurate
estimate is probably impossible. One 380 sq.
yd. patch has returned 4130 z. Average depth
taken out here was 24 yards, so the return
was over £1 per c.y., even if the gold isn’t
worth more than 50s. per oz.; and it should,
beat that. But a grateful addition to these
New Guinea reports would be an estimate,
even a rough one, of working costs, say on
a yardage basis. The uninitiated might then
get an idea of how much gilt there is on
the gingerbread for shareholders. The
co. has bought a De Haviland ’plane
to ply between the Bulolo field and
the coast, and the service should be running
by the end of February. The trip should be
done in half an hour instead of the present
eight days of mountain-climbing with teams
of native carriers. The longer journey to
Rabaul will occupy four and a half hours.

Check boring of the Twyford Malayan area
at Gunong, in Kantang (F.M.S.). has been
completed by C. .T. Rowe, and the Sydney
office awaits the official report to exercise
its option. The next step will be a flotation.
Meantime the 8000 contribs. in Twyford,
which was formed merely to check the area,
are at 100 p.c. premium. The parent, Sydney
Malaya, in 1000 20s. shares, has made a
start to realise its ambition to become
a little Austral Malay. It has additional
prospects in Dunsford’s area in Siam, where
Rowe estimates that 20,000,000yd5. are
proved; another 1000 acres are being scout-
bored. Correspondence with a London group
for turning over one of these areas is being
conducted.
* * * *
A radio message alleges that the Bulolo
leases which caused so much argument and
dissension have been inaccurately measured
off, and are 34 chains in excess of their
proper area. It is expected that the surplus
ground will be thrown open as ordinary
miners’ claims to be balloted for. If this is
done it will be interesting to see what this
ground, recently declared by officials and the
applicants for the leases to be unsuitable
for hand-working, will yield to the shovel
and box.
* * * *
Austral Asiatic Tin has a report from its
representative, A. C. S. McLeod, saying that
the 98 bores put down on its Tarua option
show 240 z. to the cubic yard. Unfortunately
the average bottoming is at ' 13ft., and, as
this lease covers only 120 acres, the pro-
perty’s life is short, as these dredging con-
cerns go. To set this off, the co. has taken
an option over another property about 10
miles from Tarua, and known as Muang
Tuat. There are three leases, totalling about
300 acres, and there is tin-bearing “garden
land” —which means alluvium —close by and
available. The A. A. Co. is now testing this
proposition, and also the down-stream areas
on Tarua. A cabled report says that so
far on the Tarua extension 26 bores to a
depth of 15ft. have given an average of
13oz. At Muang Tuat only nine bores went
down before the monsoonal floods stopped
operations. These averaged 26ft. and
returned 320 z. to the c.y.; but McLeod says
that “this is probably the richest portion
of the area.” The show has good backing.
McLeod is a mining engineer of high stand-
ing ; and with Joseph Tomlinson as chair-
man and the Henry Jones interests repre-
sented by Nossiter and Palfreyman, the man-
agement should be all right. The £25 shares,
paid up to £lO, were last week quoted at a
premium of nearly £4 —for which the mana
of the jam interests is mainly responsible.
* * * *
“Old Warden” : Prank Anstey, M.H.R., is
back from the Bulolo fields; but as a share-
holder in various leases he can’t be regarded
as wholly unprejudiced. To begin with, he
says the leasehold areas on various named
streams are not rich enough to sustain a
hand-working miner, but will have to be
worked by a modern mining plant. But
almost in the same breath he remarks that
Is. a cubic yard will pay dividends (for
dredge or sluicing methods presumably), and
that tests show all the beaches and terraces
on Edie Creek and the Wailut will give from
ss. to 20s. per yard. It would be difficult
ground indeed that would not pay a hand
worker at anything from 10s. to 20s. a yard,
provided he had the water, even with gold
at £2 10s. an ounce—and lower river gold is
said to go as high as £3 17s. 6d. an ounce,
especially on the Wailut. However, Anstey’s
figures are useful for comparison with some
of those given in recent reports by companies
holding ground within the area he refers to.
Over 50s. a yard is talked by some of them.
* * * *
When Malim Nawar South set in with a
plant built to dig to a depth of 85ft., there
were loud scoffs —of course the thing
couldn’t be done. When the early reports of
success came along, it was a flash in the
pan—the strain would soon pull the plant
to bits. Lately-received reports in detail
from the engineer in charge show that the
dredge digs as comfortably at 85ft. as at
25ft., to paraphrase the report. No trouble
is being experienced, and the judgment of
the men who advocated the new departure
has been vindicated. It will not be long
before 120 ft. will be worked: an English co.
has already placed orders for a dredge to
go down that depth. As far as this country
is concerned, Malim Nawar South led the
way; and to Malcolm Newman belongs most
of the credit for it.
* # * *
Thomo Tin, a Melbourne buyer of Malayan
and other options, is getting set to float off
Bayas Tujoh. The property is close to
Kampar (F.M.S.), and 80 million yards
are said to have been proved, though no
values are as yet forthcoming. However,
two dredges to dig over 50ft. are to be
built forthwith at a cost of £70,000 each,
which is a fine preliminary gesture.
* * * *
Dredging returns for the first half of
January included Malim Nawar South,
Malim Nawar and Ivundang. The first
named, with its new dredge digging to 85ft.,
and said to be able to go to 00ft. if neces-
sary, has awakened most interest, and the
news of its successful trials brought its back-
ers a lot of relief. In 286 hours, 70.000 c.y.
were put through for 20 tons of oxide—not
an astonishing return. Malim Nawar took
10 tons out of 55,000 c.y. in 262 hours. Ivun-
dang, with 10 tons from 30,000 c.y. in 200
working hours, lias distinctly the best bat-
ting average of the trio.
* * * *
“Mining Engineer”: It can be taken as
proved that Malayan dredges equipped with
jigs make a much better recovery of the tin
content of the ground dug than the old
sluice-box dredges. The Settlements’ jig
dredge at Taiping saves much more fine
tin than the three box-dredges of Tupai,
Kota and Larut put together, though work-
ing the same run of ground. The fact that
the primary jigs are not asked to make a
clean product (the work of the clean-up
jigs) gives a big factor of safety. Daily
sampling seldom shows more than a trace of
tin, even in the fourth hutches of the
primary jigs, and naturally, under these
circumstances, the tailings show no tin or
at most a trace. Compare this with the
daily loss during the messy clean-up of the
sluice-boxes. The box-dredge die-hards make
a catch-cry of the supposed difficulty of
stacking tailings behind a jig dredge, refus-
ing to recognise that the stern jigs can,
by being provided with a separate launder,
stack tailings as high as sluice-boxes can.
and it is not necessary either to increase
the height of the tumbler or to provide a
tailings stacker. Even were the latter neces-
sary it offers no formidable difficulty.
* * * *
Very heavy—some say unprecedented—
rains have fallen throughout Malaya, and
from Penang to Singapore business has been
disorganised. No serious damage to the
mines, however, is reported.
* * * *
Rawang Concessions, mentioned in last
week’s Bulletin, will be electrically
equipped, like Rawang; the power will be
obtained from Rawang’s powerhouse, which
should decrease the cost to both cos. For
some years the F.M.S. Railway Department
has had under consideration the deviation of
the main railway line at Rawang, and now
that the same organisation holds the land
on both sides, it is expected the deviation will
be undertaken forthwith. This would add
quite an appreciable yardage to both Raw-
ang and Rawang Concessions.
“Old Hatter”:—
It is refreshing to be reminded of one’s boyhood
days in Sandhurst and Castlemaine by reports of
9oz. to 14oz. crushings at the Vic. State batteries
at Greensborough, Ballarat East and Queenstown.
On the Queenstown and Diamond Creek goldfields,
only 17 to 20 miles from Melbourne, there are
pockets of rich quartz on almost every hill, and at
a depth there are several known reefs that may
truthfully be called “true fissure”—a description
much soiled by ignoble use in prospectuses. The
Union Co. at Diamond Creek worked a true fissure
reef down to 850 ft. A. W. Howitt, Government
geologist, gave the mine a great report—published
a month after it had shut down! A fire destroyed
the plant, and that was the dead finish.

“Stavanger”: Two wool-buyers who
attended the Hobart sales the other day
recognised one another with a start. They
were frequent visitors to Australia on wool-
buying missions in bygone days, and good
friends, too. One was French, the other
German. Then the war came, and the
Frenchman was sent to Germany as a spy.
He was doing his job well until his German
friend spotted him in a Berlin cafe. The
German, instead of giving his old pal away,
permitted himself no sign of recognition
publicly, but when the opportunity pre-
sented itself he quietly gave the Frenchman
hours to get out of Germany. The Gaul
took the advice, leaving Hunland with a
sound hide and an increased regard for at
least one Teuton. The pair had not met
since then, until Fate threw them together
at the Hobart sales.

“The Deacon”: A young Australian of
Darby’s Falls, near Cowra (N.S.W.), recently
horrified his mother by marching into the
house with nearly six feet of black snake in
his hands, depositing his trophy with the
casual remark “I-Ie bit me, Mum, but I goi
him.” When mum found her second wind
she discovered the statement to be the whole
truth. The youngster’s luck was in, though,
for the thick golf-stockings he wore had
absorbed most of the venom.

“Stavanger”: Brisbane’s coatless brigade
would be regarded as Bolsheviks in at least
one Hobart office. The other day, when the
city was sweltering under the hottest day
for years, and even the freezing-works em-
ployees were grumbling, the head of a Gov-
ernment department received a petition that
the men might be allowed to follow tbe
excellent example set by the ladies of the
department—“clad so that they do not suffer
unduly from the heat”- —and remove their
coats. They were curtly told that it would
be “improper” to take off their coats in a
room where so many ladies worked, and had
to be content with permission to shed their
waistcoats, provided that they did it in
some quiet corner where nobody could see
them!

“Camboreem” (from a Far-Northern
town) : Are some constitutions naturally
immune to the ordi-
nary effects of
drink? A bush-
man who hardly
ever touches any-
thing stronger than
tea stayed with us
over Christmas. I
took him to a
dance during the
New Year festivi-
ties, and another
guest took him over
to the bar and
shouted him a
whisky. After that
things moved
quickly, and he
found himself
absorbing in quick
succession sherry,
port, champagne
and gin, with a
glass or two of
punch to finish up
with. We had a
long walk home
after the dance,
and he was not even
mildly exhilarated,
nor did he have a
headache in the
morning; in fact,
he dragged me out
at 6 a.m. (after
dancing till 3.30)
for a morning
swim. He con-
fided to me, when
I taxed him with
mixing his drinks,
that liis personal
choice wrnuld have
been soda-water,
but the fellows he
met were so friend-
ly that he did not
like to seem rude
by refusing their
shouts. I did not
tell him that it
was only a per-
verted sense of
humor that had
caused the others
to fill up the “way-
backer” with such
a mixture, but I
guess the laugh was on them. I’m wonder-
ing now what sort of tipple it would take
to make that chap drunk.

“Pill” : You may still hear in one district
of Queensland the tale of the squatter who
made a trip to the Old Country and sent
a racing stallion home ahead of him. intend-
ing to use the animal for stud purposes.
After the quarantine authorities had done
with it, it was duly sent on to the station.
As the boss was not due for two or three
months, the hands decided to run the
imported horse in the chief handicap at a
neighboring race meeting. So a pedigree
was concocted, and the unclipped and rugged
Englishman took his place in the field with-
out raising any suspicions in the minds of
the stewards or the books, the latter laying

10 to 1 against him. There is little to tell
about the race. The field kept together until
coming into the straight, when the imported
horse came right away. The station-hands
were feeling for their betting-tickets when
the good thing put his front foot in a rabbit-
hole, turned a somersault and broke his
neck. A Chow cook was the only man who
stayed on the station to welcome the squat-
ter home.

“Gum Stump”: Perhaps “Mick Stupp”
(B. 30/12,/’26) was born under a luckier

’roo, having been wounded,
was pulled down by the dogs.
The hunters gathered round,
and Jim shoved the butt of
his gun against the prostrate
’roo’s ribs. The “old man”
immediately grabbed it, and
his claw catching the ham-
mer released it and caused
the discharge. The boy
spent many months on his
back, but eventually recov-
ered.

“X.D.”: A most persis-
tent sort of firebug (at least
he is supposed to be all the
same bug) was at work in
Melbourne on the 15th and
16th. He started soon after
dark in an alley of Little
Bourke, and then piled up
some scores of packing-cases
against a warehouse door in
Latrobe-street and lit a
healthy volcano. Perhaps
owing to police surveillance
he bugged no more that night,
but next day (Sunday) he
lighted the rear of the Bri-
tannia Theatre, did the same
at the Tivoli, and finally
achieved about. £20,000
worth of damage to three or
four warehouses. There is,
so far, lack of any clue, and
if a suspect is located a J.P. will pro-
bably let him out on light bail tendered by
a person with previous convictions.

“F.A.L.”: The old spirit is not dead. An
epic story is told in the Casino district
(N.S.W.) of a family whoso home and fur-
niture were destroyed during the bush fires
of last year. They had moved into a new
home, when a call came for the men to
go to the help of others who were trying
to save the local school from the more
recent fires. While the men were absent, a
swiftly-moving tongue of fire licked the new
home. The mother and her two children,
aged 12 and 15 years, attacked the flames,
which set fire to the wooden blocks support-
ing the house. The mother fought the fire
till she was exhausted; but the children kept
at it, finally creeping under the house and
putting out the fire with billycans of water.
A Casino business man offered to supply
the family with some household goods free.
“Oh, we’ll be all right,” said the brave Aus-
tralian mother; "we can manage till my hus-
band earns some money.” And at that he
had to let it stand.

“X2X”: It is just possible that there
may be some therapeutic properties in the
cockroaches which the Japanese swallow to
cure headaches (B. 26/8/’26), for that loathly
insect is much sought after by Chinese
“doctors,” who make several preparations from
it. One, administered in the form of a huge

SURGEON'S DAUGIITER : “I’ve been so anxious, Dad,
to find out whether your operation on Mr.
Bullion was successful!”
SURGEON : “Yes, yes. But I was only in the nick

SURGEON: “Serious? I should say so! Another

The other is made from the ’roaches’ wings,

the Oriental diagnostician ascribes most of
the ills of flesh. This seems extraordinary
to Occidental ideas, but it is as well to
.remember that a drug which plays a large
'part in civilised materia medica is cantha-
rides, prepared by q>n almost identically
similar process from the bodies of insects

PASS THE HARP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Dame Melba said that she had agreed to sing at
the opening of the Federal Parliament. It would be
a great opportunity for an Australian to wnte a
national patriotic song for her.”
Harp of the South that quite a time has hung
From some gaunt eucalypt’s protruding bough
Without, if one may say so, giving tongue
To any strikingly melodious row,
My country’s harp, will no one grip you now
And sweep your strings with patriot heart aflame
To win a wreath of laurel for his brow
And earn mayhap, beside poetic fame,
Some brass —and, incidentally, oblige a Dame ?
Harp of the South, whereto in other days
Sweet, mournful Kendall wove the warp and woof
Of woodland song—that crashed to Gordon s lays
Rich with the crack of whip and drum of hoof —
Harp that from ’neath his academic roof
Our Brunton Stephens twanged in classic strain—-
Were there some adequate return in oof
Some minstrel soul might make you ring again
And echo from Cape York to lone Nullarbor Plain.
Harp of the South, your strings are frayed and limp,
You need some overhauling, I’ll engage ;
Yet with a tuning-fork arid piece of gimp
One might refurbish you. Ho! Bruce and Page !
This is a hard and mercenary age.
Out with the minstrel’s dough, the jongleur’s jing,
The laureate’s £ s. d„ the harper’s wage 1
Cannot you realise there isn’t a thing
Fit for the Queen of Song at Canberra to sing.
ALL SET.
“When are we to have our dance?"
“Oh, in about another hour."
“I’ll be gone by then.”
“That won’t matter. So shall I.”
Harp of the South, you need not fear compare
With that old Tara’s storied halls that woke,
Or by St. Fillian’s spring swayed high in air,
Or hung beside the Babylonian soak.
Lots of us, doubtless, music could evoke
From you, like that in Roland’s song that glowed,
But still they ought to subsidise a bloke
Who slings the words for Melba to unload.
What price a purse for that inauguration ode?
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


DROPPING THE PILOT.
“If elected for Dailey, it is expected that Theodore will take over the leadership of the Federal Labor party from Matthew Charlton.”
MAT: “Wish you luck, Ted; though it’s not so much a new driver the team wants as a new waggon.”
“L.R.”: Between Lang and Bavin and
Charlton and Bruce and the rest. Austra-
lian politics have become so dull and dour
that the press galleries are in a state border-
ing on insurrection. Oh for something like
the days when, in Maoriland, J. W. Buck-
land produced a bill for "An Act to Regulate
the Business of Washerwomen and Mang-
lers” ! The definition section described mang-
ier as “any female who undertakes the violent
compression of any ‘wash’ between rollers at
so much a dozen.” “Wash” was defined as
“soiled linen of all varieties, articles and
apparel, and the various household utilities
that are capable of renovation, improvement
and restoration by the application of hot
or cold water in conjunction with soap or
other like ingredient, accompanied by a
violent and continued rubbing between the
hands or in some equivalent machinery.”
The unlicensed washerwoman was liable to
a fine varying from Is. to £lOO, while the
Minister of Labor was empowered to act as
conciliator between a washerwoman and an
irate customer. It was a masterly piece of
satire, modelled in its phrasing on Seddon’s
Registration of Boarding-houses Act.
* * * *
“Oxmead”: That massive Greek scholar
Professor Gilbert Murray, who left Austra-
lia for an English school at the age of 11,
carried away one curious piece of knowledge.
In the latest edition of the works of Jane
Austin one may read in “Northanger Abbey”
how Catherine blows out a candle prema-
turely in her bedroom and finds that she had
no matches to relight it, and that “not a
remnant of light in the wick could give hope
to the rekindling breath.” To the painstak-
ing editor of the volumes, the incident seemed
worth a note, so he ponderously records:
“I have not been able to discover what kind
of candle it was that could be rekindled
by blowing.” At this stage along comes the
Oxford Professor of Greek to elucidate a
point which would hardly have been regarded
as in his department. “If the editor,” he
writes, “had lived in the good old days of
tallow-candles, he would probably have been
taught by the bootboy or the gardener liow to
blow a candle out and in again. I was taught
by the gardener in Australia. The wick
should be long and, I think, a little frayed.”
One wonders how many people retain the
accomplishment to-day, or whether the infre-
quently-seen modern candle lends itself to it.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: What is the record discrepancy in
tonnage between rescuer and rescued in
Australian life-saving annals? The other day
Gwen Neilsen, a 14-year-old Elwood (Vic.)
girl, ferried a drowning man 100 yards to
shore, and quietly banded him over to the
resuscitators. He weighed 10 stone and she
six.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: The presentation to Musso-
lini of an Italian flag made of bird-of-para-
dise feathers has roused interest at the Home
and Territories Department, since the donor
is a priest of a Papuan mission, with its
headquarters at Yule Island, west of Port
Moresby. The gorgeous fowl is strictly pro-
tected in Papua and British New Guinea,
and the good father will probably receive a
“Please explain.” But a lead has been
given him by a suggestion that he got the
feathers from Dutch territory, where there
is no protection, though it would mean a
long walk or a longer swim.
* * * *
“Ginger”: Vic. Railway-Commissioner
Clapp, his officers and the militant members
of the Railway Union are all uniting to
fight what Clapp calls the motor pirates.
The railwaymen, like their chief, realise that
increased motor competition means reduced
rail services and less work; and throughout
many country districts they are boycotting
traders who patronise the road lorries.
Storekeepers who get goods by road are find-
ing the very cheap rates for empty returns
barred against them, much higher rates being
charged for empty cases, etc., which were
not carried full by rail. The boycott is not
all on one side, as the case of one Colac
merchant proves. He had ordered a con-
signment of goods for road delivery. It
arrived by rail, and he returned it to the
senders by rail, stating he must insist on
receiving it by road.
* * * *
“Pill”: Speaking of unclaimed bank
balances. I know of a bank in a flourish-
ing dairying district where £2OO is waiting
for somebody to lift it. The father of the
rector presented the parish with the sum
for the purchase of an organ. The old
gentleman and his son died very soon after
the deposit was lodged, and the bank has
never been asked for the money, which is
carrying interest.
* * * *
“Mells”: The wheelbarrow and shovel
used by South Aus. Governor Bosanquet
for turning the first sod of the Port Augusta-
Kalgoorlie railway in 1912, and subsequently
shoved and wielded by Prime Minister Andy
Fisher for a similar rite at the other end,
were dug out of retirement and taken up to
Oodnadatta the other day for use at the
ceremony which preceded the laying of rails
to Alice Springs. It seems a good precedent;
if these ornamental emblems of hard graft
will hold together, there is no reason why
they shouldn’t be used until they acquire as
many names and dates as one may some-
times see on a cricketer’s bat. It would
bo interesting to know what becomes of the
numerous implements of this sort that State
Governors have thrust into their hands for
similar purposes. The only historical barrow
which I remember seeing solemnly pre-
served among the curios of a township was
the one which did duty at the kick-off of the
Geraldton-Northampton railway - Groper-
land’s oldest line in 1879. I don’t know
what a navvy would have thought it was
for, but even a fancy wheelbarrow has one
advantage over a gold-monntod trowel—the
chief actor can’t be expected to put it in
las pocket after doing the job.

“Jim Domino”; There is one Melbourne
man wdio xvill remember his wedding as a
day of mishap. Five w T eeks ago his mother
died, and, although he wished to postpone
the ceremony, his father dissuaded him.
Last week, three hours before the ceremony,
his two groomsmen, who had been having
sectarian bickerings, rang up to cry off their
contract. Beset by this mishap, the ’groom
fell sick and the doctor who attended him
was only secured after nine other practi-
tioners had been called up. The ’groom
arrived at the church an hour late and
went through with the marriage, after an
acquaintance had been waylaid, a grev tie
hitched to his neck and tlie duties of best-
man explained to him

v eoiom J-iie late Detective-Inspector
lcn n attaclie d to the Customs
Department, was once given the job of locat-
wAi a r f i. u ® lVe A‘ lcl .t still in the Warm am-
m district. Disguised as a Salvation Army
officer, he pervaded the neighborhood selling
war RYS and looking for clues. The pro-
pnetor ot the still, learning that Christie
was on tlie job, decided to get . out while
tne going was good and. the business being
a well-established and thriving one, had no
difficulty in finding a buyer at £lOO. In
those days any person giving information to
the authorities of the existence and location
of an illicit still was entitled to half the
fine on the conviction of the offender. After
collecting his £lOO purchase money, the
seller looked up Detective Christie, and sup-
Pned him with, information which resulted
in the new owner being caught red-handed,
lle was fined £3OO, so the enterprising ongi-
of , the stlll came out of th . e business
i->>o to the good, and, as one of his offsiders
confided to me, “without a strain on his
character.”
“Nikko”: Undeterred by the welcome to
{be Carinthia’s tourists not being as cordial
as was expected, the Franconia, with a
further party of American sightseers, will
rea ch Maoriland about the middle of Feb-
ruary. This party has announced that
instead of scanning coastlines it will jour-
ney somewhat farther into the interior, and
the whole company has booked for a brief
stay at Rotorua, after which about 100
will make the journey down the Wanganui.
The intending tourists have probably not
yet heard that when the Carinthia’s wan-
derers returned to the ship at Auckland they
found every available niche occupied by a
neat little disc, attached to an American
flag, and bearing the query “Who won the
war?”

“Iverys” : Talking about the surprises that
lawyers receive. Not so very long ago a
wealthy and highly-respected citizen, know-
ing himself stricken with a fatal disease,
called with his wife on his solicitors, and
there unfolded to them an amazing tale,
He had never been able to marry the mother
of his six children, because in his youth lie
had married an English girl who' became
insane a few weeks after, and in British law
there was then no provision for annulling
the marriage. He had taken every precau-
tion to secure the future of his family, his
will leaving no loophole by wdiich the child-
ren could be disinherited, and he had also
had each one registered and christened with
his surname as an additional name, this
giving them a legal right to it. His insane
wife was still alive at the time; but some
possible complications were removed by hei
death a month before his own. The old-
established legal firm he had dealt with foi
40 years put his tale down as the big shoch
of its professional life,

MOONLIGHT IN DARLINGRURST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The moon sailed down on Darlinghurst upon a sea of
stars.
Her wake of light across the night ebbed through
the basement bars ;
The curtains spoke, the shadows woke to troubled
life, and bright
The mirrors of the wardrobe flashed like up-swung
scimitars.
The moon sailed down on Darlinghurst, and lo! the
quiet bay
Opened a beaten silver track to portals of romance.
The midnight tide went whispering for the ships to
come away;
And Night was dumb with wonder and drew breath
as in a trance.
The moon sailed down on Darlinghurst, and suddenly
the din
Of gramophone and laughter blown discordant down
the street
Was hushed, and an Italian girl fingered a mandolin,
And the still air was rich and rare with music low
and sweet.
But there were lanes in Darlinghurst where moon nor
music went,
Where in the flame of lust the shame of womanhood
was wrought
For satin gowns and wine and meat and means to
pay the rent,
Where love was not, though lips were hot on bodies
sold and bought.
The moon sailed down on Darlinghurst and overspread
her sails
Where roof and spire grew high and higher, and, in
the streets far down,
In orange shawled, the toy trams crawled on tiny
threads of rails,
Or slid between the fig-trees black along the way to
town.
And beauty came to Darlinghurst and all the parks
below,
And cars rolled down dim avenues where only lovers
go,
And women smiled and men beguiled, and houses fell
asleep •
To dream of other Springs when nights were just as
still and deep.
But near the wharves a woman screamed and
children woke in fear,;
A curse ... .a shout .... the lights go ■ 0ut. ... “ ’E’s
brealcin’ in the door!”
Bill of the 'Loo on Friday nights drinks rum as well
as beer,
And someone whispered. “Watch ’er then she’s
’ad ’im there before!”
And while the moon dipped westward, through the
stars hot tears were shed,
Because sometimes in Darlinghurst old loves rise
from the dead;
And ghosts peered into silent flats, and the young
oaks were stirred,
And a warm wind brought up the slope the notes of
some strange bird.
The moon hung low on Darlinghurst, and half the
stars were gone.
St. Mary’s bells rang twelve farewells to chimes of
old St. John;
And midnight passed and sleep at last posted her
sentinels,
And Puck went home with many a curious tale for
Oberon.

immigrant in the starling; seven or eight
years back there was a rumor that a nesting
pair had been glimpsed in the South-West,
and a bunch of axemen was rushed to the
spot to fell a huge karri-tree. _ The birds,
it is presumed, were duly eliminated in
the smash, but not so much as a feather or
a bit of egg-shell tvas ever found to settle the
question of Avlietlier they were starlings or
not. The sparrow incident opens up the
interesting question as to whether the Carin-
thia’s tourists or the skipper could be called
to account by the State supposing that,
through their fatuousness, the genus passer
had been introduced to W.A. orchards and
wlieatficlds. Probably not —Uncle Sam’s law
is rather one-sided on that head. But what
a target for damages a boatload like that
would offer!

“Muggins, Jun.”: A 20-year-old clerk in
a Vic. country bank received 525. weekly,
and was forced to pay 355. a week board at
a hotel —tlmre being no private places to
stay at —and 3s. 6d. weekly for washing and
mending. An insurance policy taken out
under agreement with the bank on joining
cost ss. weekly. To enjoy life and dress as
a young fellow in his position is expected to

10s. a week extra doing the books for the
local store. But here officialdom pushed its
nose in. An inspector visited the branch,
and through an unintentional remark dropped
by the storekeeper at the hotel table, found
out about the extra work and was forced
by the regulations to report it. The clerk
was asked to explain and was then told ro
give up either the bank or the books, “such
a proceeding not being compatible with the
bank’s opinion of gentlemanliness.” Mere
boys are often left in charge of large sums
of money while the teller is at lunch or
down the street on business;
and it is a continual wonder
to me that there are so few
cases of embezzlement. The
banks could easily afford a
slightly higher log for clerks
away from home.

“X.N.0.”: Whenever a
ship comes through any very
severe ordeal the wireless
operator is singled out for
special interview and news-
paper reference. Yet in bad
weather “Sparks,” out of the
whole ship’s company, has
the best time. His job neces-
sitates his being sheltered in
every possible why. Being
on the upper deck lie has the
best chance of getting away
when and if the time comes
to abandon ship. He is pro-
tected from the elements as
the upper-deck people can
never be, and he is saved the
appalling rat-in-a-trap con-
ditions that are felt in an
engine - room or stokehold
when Father Neptune really
gets going. Nevertheless,
the wireless man is nearly
always the hero of every
maritime episode. News-
paper reporters should re-
adjust their values.

“X.D.” : Sydney dog-steal-
ers are moving with the
times and discarding tlieir
old, crude methods. The
latest device of the enterpris-
ing fraternity is to attach
to the ferrule end of an um-
brella a piece of bullock’s
liver treated with aniseed-
oil, and then walk slowly
past any animal which looks
worth stealing. The lure is
irresistible for Fido, and the
operator is followed by his
prey to a quiet spot where a
confederate is waiting. Re-
wards are subsequently
obtained for the majority of
the captures, and the beauty
of the scheme is that if the
owner chances to turn up at
an inopportune moment the
dog-thief can claim that the
pup has perversely followed
him.
“Pfella”: Three musically-inclined Port
Iledland (W.A.) men were invited to a
week-end at a way-out station the kitchen
of which stands some 20 yards from the
main dwelling. Looking out of his bedroom-
window one of the visitors saw,, coming
across from the kitchen, three, gins each
carrying a cup of tea with a slice of toast
sticking up from the saucer. One lubra
had the misfortune to let fall her piece
of toast, but she agilely retrieved .it by
picking it up with her toes, and it was
placed back again on the saucer. The joke
was too good to keep to himself, and the
man who saw it told the others. The boss
got to hear of the incident and he threw out
hot reprimands and cautions. Next morning
all the guests were up early to see the gins
cross to the house, a feat which was per-
SATISFIED.
“He’s enormously well-off, isn’t he?”
“Well, he thinks he is. He’s a widower.”

the tea arrived they found out how acci-
dents had been avoided. A hole had been
punched through each piece of toast, and a
small length of string fastened the slice to
the handle of the cup.

“Up Top”: “Old Harry” has lived the
life of a hermit on Deliverance Island
(Barrier Reef) since about ’9l. Occasionally
a pearl-sliell boat
drops anchor and
leaves the recluse
tobacco, flour and
tea, together with
a memory of human
companionship, to
sweeten possibly a
year’s loneliness.
Time flies in the
tiny vegetable gar-
den and among the
fish - traps, and
fairly buzzes dur-
ing the turtle sea-
son. With luck.
Harry catches a
few tortoises and
trades their shell to
the occasional
boats. About 1910
some soft-hearted
T.I. people had him
brought in, but the
old fellow pined,
and he implored to
be allowed to go
back, so they re-
turned him to his
island home. About
1921 Dick Roach,
on his way from
New Guinea, called
in to see if the her-
mit was still alive.
He was, and was
taking a serious in-
terest in the affairs
of the world, his
first remark being,
“I heard there’s a
war on. Is it over
yet?” Last year
Frank Hurley
dropped in on the

found him carrying
a bingey like a ,
football, due to many years turtle-eating.

“Hamer”: Just-dead Jack Cochran was
“the missing majority” in an exciting inci-
dent of the N.S.W. Parliament in which the
first Labor Government ruled with a majo-
rity of one. I met
him in a bar with
Jimmy McNeill
(M.L.A. for Pyr-
mont), both drink-
ing ginger-ale, and
each in turn whis-
pered to me that
he was pledged to
look after the other
and see that he
was in his place in
Parliament to
maintain the Gov-
ernment strength.
Neither of them
was inordinately
fond of ginger-ale.
The arrival of
George Burgess,
flushed with a big
win at the ponies
which he insisted
upon celebrating
with fizz, set things
going more nor-
mally. If Wade
had known he
might have turned
the Government
out that evening;
but the Laborites
were alive to then-
danger before Wade
scented it. J. B.
Mercer was set up
to hold the floor
whilst a frenzied
search was made
for the missing
majority. McNeill
was found early,
but it was late be-
fore Cochran was
discovered in the
upper Tivoli bar —
now closed. He
refused to return
to Parliament un-
less the Labor whip
—a strict teetotal-
ler, by the way—
bought him a bottle
of whisky. The bottle was bought.

“It would he a good thing if men were as
fond of their wives as they are of their
whisky.”
“Well, perhaps they would he if wives would
improve with age like whisky does.”
Frank Anstey, who has resigned the
deputy-leadership of the Federal Labor-Oppo-
sition, lias paid the penalty for being an
entertaining speaker. He hasn’t been taken
seriously by either Parliaments or electors.
What was really the matter, as everybody got
to know, was that he was always prepared to
sacrifice a hit of accuracy for the sake of
effect.. And he has always dearly loved
mischief. When Premier Bent proposed that
Parliament thank just-resigned Irvine (now
Vic. C.J.I for liis services as Premier and
legislator, Anstey moved as an amendment
that the Iceberg he presented with a framed
copy of his Railway Strike Suppression Bill,
“with the earnest hope that it may do him
good.” But he has a big, soft heart, and
for all his cynicism is an utter sentimen-
talist.
James Cobb White, N. S. Wales M.L.C.,who
died last week, was a grandson of the James
White who came to Australia in 1825 as sheep-
manager for the A. A. Co. at Port Stephens.
That White founded a dynasty of wealthy
pastoralists. One of his sons struck north
to Armidale, and established runs there-
abouts : Francis, the M.B.C.’s father, made
the Scone-Muswellbroolc district his habitat;
James, who was nearly 72, had a solid, old-
fashioned sense of his public responsibilities
—he threw himself into many public move-
ments, and became an M.L.C. in 1008. His
brother, H.L., of Belltrees, Scone, five years
younger, has established there a sanctuary
for Australian beasts and birds. Besides being
an ornithologist he is one of the best-known
philatelists in Australia- —he gave a collec-
tion of stamps worth £15,000 to the Mit-
chell Library.
Prior to this year W. B. Mclnnes had
won the Archibald Prize for portraiture four
times, and had received £2OOO 12s. 9d. in
cash. This year, when Mclnnes has won
it again, it is worth about £550.
If all goes well Australia should later in
the year hear Gilbert Murray, Regius Profes-
sor of Greek at Oxford. The doctor is one
of the greatest classical scholars of modern
times, and in addition has the rare gift of
clothing the classical dramas in great beauty
of English diction. He is the brilliant brother
of the brilliant Administrator of Papua. They
are the sons of Terence Aubrey Murray, a
one-time President of the N.S.W. Leg. Coun-
cil, though as Gilbert left home at the age
of 11 his associations have been closer with
the old country than with the new. He mar-
ried a daughter of the Earl of Carlisle.
The Fairfax private co. which owns the
S. M. Herald got two new directors last
week, and one of them, W. G. Conley, is the
first man other than a Fairfax to ever sit
on the board. Conley, a Queenslander from
Warwick, brought his young red - head and
his flaming energy to the S. M. Herald’s
reporting staff a good many years ago, and
so impressed “Mr. James” that he was trans-
ferred to the commercial side and presently
made general manager. The other new direc-
tor, W. O. Fairfax, is on the literary side.
Victorian employers’ representative in the
forthcoming delegation to Henry Ford’s land
will be H. E. Guy, a member of the firm of
John Danks and Son and its works man-
ager. He bulks large in the Vic. Chamber
of Manufactures hierarchy, and is chairman
of the Made in Australia Council, and of a
host of other councils and committees that
interest themselves in industrial organisa-,
tion. One of his hobbies is the standardisa-
tion of Australian engineering products. At
42 he brings a young and keen eye into the
delegation.
The last of the vacancies on the Adelaide
Local Court Bench, caused by promotions
on the death of Judge Mitchell, has been
filled by a son of brilliant Paris Nesbit and
brother of Reg, president of the State Licens-
ing Bench. The new S.M. was admitted to
the Bar in 1914. since when he has pur-
sued the Costs bird in northern country
towns. Two S.M.’s and a silk and a “stuff”
barrister in the one family must be close up
to an Australian record. Probably only the
Windeyer-Ralstons beat it.
Stanley Ellis, of Hamilton (M.L.), has
dealt a blow at the notion that when the
Quivery Isles require a new record in big-
fish catching they have to import an Ameri-
can novelist. The other day he landed with
a rod and line a 5501 b. mako shark after a
three-hours’ struggle.
The selectors have picked Ewen McKinnon,
M.A., B.Sc., for the job of Director of the
Plant Quarantine division of the Federal
Health Department, which carries a salary of
£BOO a year. He is one of a Ballina
(N.S.W.) family, all of whom have made
good in different lines. Malcolm is principal
of Wagga High School; Kenneth, marine
engineer, with an extra-chief’s ticket, has
gone to Glesga to settle in business; Jack,
instructor in engineering at Sydney Uni., was
killed on the Peninsula; sister Lyle is head-
mistress at Ballina. Ewen started as a
schoolteacher, and has always followed the
gleam of the microscope.
Railway publicity work leads to some
good jobs these days. Rotund Arthur
Hyland, Vic. Railway Commissioner Clapp’s
first slogan-writer, pulled off the £l5OO billet
of director of Australian trade and publicity
in London. Now Roy Gollan, who took
over most of Hyland’s duties when the demise
of the Evening Sun pitched him out of
liis sub-editor’s chair, has blossomed into the
Government Tourist Officer’s understudy.
Gollan’s latest stunt is a trip to Maoriland
to pick up the Cunard liner Franconia and
its horn-rimmed millionaires. Some of
Clapp’s tourist films are to be screened on the
boat, and Gollan will impart information
relating to Victoria’s scenery in an attempt
to induce the globe-trotters to come and see
it for themselves.
General Evan Wisdom, who has been tell-
ing interviewers about the New Guinea gold-
finds, ought to know T more about gold than
most Administrators. He was at Coolgardie
(W.A.) in the early days, although his acti-

pectors.
tivities there centred more in pubs than
gold-claims. In later years he took to poli-
tics, and held a safe seat as M.L.A. for
Claremont when the war broke out. The
General is 58, and arrived in Westralia from
Inverness 35 years ago.
“pP Top”: The .late Davy Mills (B.
20/1/ 27) was Thursday Island’s oldest
inhabitant. As far back as 1872 he landed
at Somerset, then the settlement for Torres
Strait. Thence he ventured on to the then
practically unknown Thursday Island, and
his cutter grounded near Channel Rock.
Luckily for the pioneer, the natives on that
day were inclined to be friendly. Mills cut
his way ashore through mangroves at what
is now the centre of the town. He com-
menced boat-building, and when the pearling
rush set in properly he came into his own.
Gerard Trower, who has worn the Angli-
can apron in Australia’s far north-west out-
post for the last 18 years, has just handed in
his resignation. Prior to that appointment
he had been for eight years in Nyassaland
(S’Africa), and in the late ’nineties his
massive figure was well known in Sydney,
where he was rector of Christ Church, St.
Lawrence. He was about the best-dressed
prelate in Australia, and even in tropical
Broome lie could never have been mistaken
for anything but an ecclesiastical dignitary.
Ilis old college of Iveble, Oxford, lias pre-
sented him with a pocket-handkerchief parish
in the Isle of Wight. He will be no great
advt. for a White Australia: he is a brindle-
labor man.
Took off on his final flight at the Caulfield
Military Hospital the other day, Captain
Carl J. Thomsen, late of the R.F.C.—C. J.
de Garis’s very able pilot when that ill-fated
person counted the ownership of a private
plane the hall-mark of the super go-getter.
T.B. contracted in the war years (possibly
w hile he was a prisoner of war in Austria)
was the cause of Thomsen’s death. He was
only 33 at the close.
W. B. Wilkinson, just dead iu Adelaide
after a long illness, was a man who “found
himself” rather late. At 30-odd he was just
a fashionable young man, who had tried his
hand as stock-agent and share-broker and
m a bank. Then he started as land-agent,
and quickly rose to the top of that crowded
calling, profession or whatever it is. It
became quite the thing to trust him with the
cutting-up of suburban estates; and his firm
developed the gift of making each of them
look (on paper) like paradise. A liard-
worker, lie did good service on a host of
public bodies till illness laid him aside. His
two sons and other partners carry on the
business.
Injurious germs have had a bad time dur-
ing the 14 years Dr. T. W. Sinclair has perse-
cuted them as medical officer to the Mel-
bourne City Council. The Schick test and
immunisation process used in the schools
were introduced by him, and diphtheria mor-
tality has dropped since their arrival. He
organised the attack on infantile paralysis,
and was able to spare serum ammunition
t n sudden outbreak occurred in Sydney
111-health lias now forced him to lay doWn
his weapons.

tile parson as the Rev. Edward Taffs. who
looks after the Anglican fold in the sugar-
giowing country round Mossman (N.Q.'l
After founding Trinity Grammar School
Kew, he left Victoria to work amongst the

score of years or so has been rector of Moss-
maa - P a i n ts, carves, is a musical expert
and a handy man with tools, works in ecclesi-
astical embroidery and has woven some fine
floor-rugs. In addition he is sufficient of an
architect to have drawn the plans for a fine
stone and brick church of Byzantine type
(very unusual in Australia), a good part of
which he has erected with his own hands. In
one of the churches blown down in a cyclone
some years ago the windows were all beauti-
fully painted by him. He does most of his
pastoral work on Horseback.
Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Eade, of Bathurst
(N.S.W.), must have begun to feel lonely
before death came at 98. She had survived
by 33 years the husband who brought lior
to Australia nearly 80 years ago, and took
her with him to Lambing Flat and other
gold-rush places; and six of her 10 children
had crossed over before her. She settled
with her husband at Bathurst when the gold
fever burnt itself out, and stayed there to
become the City of the Plains’ oldest inhabi-
tant.
Probably few Australians have ever seen
an ox roasted whole; about the last out-
break in N.S.W. of the old English enter-
tainment arid American barbecue was at
Liverpool 40 years ago, when Hugh Murphy
organised a shivoo at which a bullock anil
20 sheep were roasted in the public park.
Murphy, a native of the town and its
oldest inhabitant (he was 80 when he
died last week), was a hearty auctioneer
who combined religion and sport with ener-
getic participation in almost every local
movement.
“Diorite”: Dicky Hamilton is retiring
from the management of Kalgoorlie’s richest
bonanza, the Great Boulder Prop., after
31 years of it. Under his guidance Great
Boulder produced nearly £14,000.000 worth
of bullion, and paid over £6,000,000 in divs.,
mostly _to English investors. He had his
first mining experience under his stepfather
at Bendigo, and in the early ’eighties was
managing a show in India. Then he had a
spell on the Peel River (N.S.W.), and later
managed the Canada del Oro property in
Arizona. A youthful association with Zeb
Lane caused the promoter of the Boulder to
send for Hamilton in 1895, when Kalgoorlie
only had to be tickled to laugh gold. The
next year saw him ensconced in the mana-
gerial office —a corrugated-iron camp—the
main shaft being then down 200 ft. He con-
tinues as local director and consulting engi-
neer—no doubt by way of pension.

PASSCHENDAELE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We held our posts on the Blighty fronts; we kept
off the fierce attacks
When the medical boards put on their stunts; we
held our own with the jacks.
But there was a fly in our glass of bliss —our yarns
they were old and stale,
And the three of us were alike in this: we knew
nothing of Passchendaele.
From Shrapnel Gully to Moquet Farm the whole of
the game we knew,
And we told our tales, and we saw no harm if the
tales were partly true.
But swift fame passes ; we could not fail to see that
the end had come,
For the reos were talking of Passchendaele, and the
three of us must sit dumb.
And Bill expounded, and Jim agreed, and I in my
place concurred
That our position was wrong indeed, and likewise
most absurd.
“These reinstoushments,” said Bill with heat and
some words that I could not pen,
“With their modern stories have got us beat, and
it’s us for the Front again.”
So we had a final go with the jacks—a glorious go—
and thus
Aware of our prowess at last the quacks had a final
go with us ;
A wangled leave for a final fling—it was won by a
well-worn tale—
And then away to the Front to bring fresh stories
from Passchendaele 1
And there wasn’t a doubt amongst the three —a bit
of a flutter, and then
Our papers mdrked with a 828, the Strand and
the girls again !
“There,” Bill declaimed, “we shall meet anon,” and
w e joyfully said “You bet!”
But the years have come, and the years have gone,
and the Strand is waiting yet.
Old Jim—lie’s making a brave pretence that he is
the same man still,.
But it isn’t an earthly audience that’s listening now
to Bill.
And one of his sorrows to-day, I’ll bet, if sorrows his
peace assail.
Is that he failed when he tried to get a story of
Passchendaele. '

“Adam’s Apple”: Don’t beetles like the
ear-splitting screech of the cicada? I was
gazing at a large gum-tree at the back of
my place last Sunday morning when the
cicadas tuned up. Immediately a swarm
of king-beetles darted from the foliage of
the gum and settled in a near-by pepper-
tree. As this was not the first time I had
witnessed the flight of beetles from a tree
when the cicadas gave vent to song, I sus
pect it is the noise that drives them out.
“C. Coral” (Thursday Island) : Reports
of outsized sharks continue to come in from
the Torres Strait islanders, and from the
cast coast of North Australia, the creatures
being described as longer than a lugger
(therefore about 60ft. in length), with “eyes
all-same saucepan, and mouth proper-big all-
same stern of boat. An’ he got whisker hang-
down underneath.” No specimens have been
captured so far, and the natives are not over-
keen on trying their luck; but possibly the
visitors belong to the basking shark variety,
which grow to a great length, though regarded
as harmless.
* * * *
“L.A.D.”: I would be glad if some Abo.
expert informed me of the correct method
of preparing rabbit-skins tor a rug. I have
the skins, and they have been pegged out
and are dry, but the fur is inclined to drop
out. They are winter skins, and their origi-
nal owners were shot, not poisoned.
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: The pearling lugger
Onyx was lately wrecked on Trial Island
(North Australia), and the crew made oft
in the dinghy for Booroloola, leaving Assari,
the Japanese owner, to watch the vessel. Dur-
ing the crew’s absence the blacks murdered
Assari and pillaged
the vessel. A some-
what similar tra-
gedy occurred some
years ago, when a
Port Hedland
(W.A.) pearling
lugger put into
Shoal Bay for
water. The natives
offered to fill the
water-bags’ and take
them out to the
lugger. Subsequent
proceedings can
only be guessed at;
the natives evi-
dent 1 y secreted
their spears and
stone-axes aboard
the boats and mur-
dered the crew of
seven, including
one white man.
The vessel was pil-
laged, and, with all
sails set, let loose.
She was picked up
later by a Broome
pearler, who
divided his crew
and brought the
vessel into port.
The tribes between
Derby and Wynd-
ham are warlike
and savage, and
pearling luggers anchored off Devil’s Inlet
and the Whirlpools invariably have guards
posted throughout the night.

“Rob P.” : Old Joe was the camp’s special-
ist. “Starve the lizards,” he said, “there
ain’t no kangaroos in the West now. Them
runts o’ things yer see about nowadays
wouldn’t have a chance in a decent drought.
Back in ’92 now, ’roos was ’roos. In them
times when we ’ad a drought there wasn’t
a green thing anywheres except the trees, an’
all the smaller ones o’ them up to 12ft. high
was picked clean by emus. But the ’roos was
all right. . ’Twpsn’t anything to see an old-
man Too bend down a 30ft. saplin’ an’ hold
it while the rest had a feed.”
“Anopf”: Speaking as a member of the
Anzac Mounted Division throughout the war,
and from several years’ residence in the
N.T. thereafter, I don’t think that anybody
is immune from malaria (B. 6/l/’27). As
far as I am aware,
not a single mem-
ber of my troop
(and probably the
squadron) who
spent two or more
months in the Jor-
dan Valley escaped
it, though some did
not develop it until
we struck bad
weather in the
Bight, this side of
Fremantle. A per-
son in the pink of
condition is less
likely to be its vic-
tim than one who
is not, but that is
not immunity. I
had malaria weeks
before I knew it.
I got very tired
one day and woke
up in a field hos-
pital. I have now
been cured for
seven years, and
have given up put-
ting my blood
under the micro-
scope whenever I
don’t feel well. As
to the N.T., there
is very little
malaria there ex-
cept when an in-
fected person
passes it ‘round.
As an example of
this passing on,
when some years
ago the cook on the John Alee had malaria,
an outbreak occurred at every stopping-place.
“Vofsa”: If “Saaedi” (B. 16/12/’26) could
come with me in Victoria on fire-patrol he
would see a line of bush fires starting up
at about the pace a horse could walk.
Cattlemen themselves make no bones about
the need for burning-off every three years
to sweeten the runs, and don’t bother to
advance theories about broken bottles, light-
ning, the friction of tree limbs, and so on.
Lightning certainly causes fire in isolated
cases, but to advance it as an important factor
in creating them is absurd. If the Vic. Forests
Commission could eliminate all except acci-
dentally-caused fires, it would require less
than one-tenth the present fire-prevention
staff.
“Bogan Farmer”: I was at one of the
most disastrous bush fires of the year, in
which three lives were lost, and Heaven
knows how much stock and crop. The
cause? Carelessness—a man carrying open
fire in heavily-grassed country, with the
wind roaring at JO miles an hour. Once
started, the fire leapt the Bogan as if it
were a sheep-pad. Crop insurance also is
something that, wants looking into, and that
speedily. I had a three-bag crop and could
have got it insured for eight bags. Is this
right? There is a share-farmer near me
who had a four-bag crop insured for eight
bags. Now this man has no fencing or stock
to lose in case of fire. What would an un-
scrupulous man do?
“Larrapinta” : Many fires are undoubtedly
started by lightning. One sweltering night
last summer two bee-keepers were driving
along the Clare-Spalding (S.A.) road in a
motor-lorry. The time was about midnight.
Suddenly a dazzling flash of lightning darted
down from overhead. It struck into a heavy
paddock of dry grass on Bungaree station. A
red glow appeared a couple of seconds later,
and by the time the two bee-keepers reached
the spot the paddock was well alight. They
started to beat out the flames, but it was
not until an hour later, when 100 fire-
fighters were on the scene with several
water-carts, that the fire was got under con-
trol. I know this because I was one of
the two bee-keepers.
“Gordon” : The discussion on causes of bush
fires brings to my mind an occasion when the
demon smouldered for nine months awaiting
an opportunity. To obtain the maximum area
of crop Westralian settlers plough and
drill as fast as the burners-off make room
for them. In harvesting the crop in this
instance, the main-harvester wheel sank
through a top-covering of about six inches of
soil and exposed to the air a cavitv which
immediately burst into flame. Quick action
saved the harvester and horses, although the
crop itself was soon blackened out. The
onlv feasible explanation was that a large
underground root had slowly burnt along its
length during the period from April to
January.

“Te W.”: “Bird snorts” —that is, color
variations, such as white crows and magpies
—are of relatively infrequent occurrence, but
certain birds, such as the finches, are mo-e
liable to “sport" than others. Some little
time ago I came across a “sport” honey-
eater in a N.SAV. South Coast scrub, its
entire plumage being canary-yellow, except-
PAVING THE WAY.
CITY GIRL: “What’s worrying you, Dave, dear?”
DAVE : “I was just wonderin’ if dad would he sport enough to do
th' milkin’ w’en we’re on our honeymoon s’posin ’ yeh said
‘Yes’ if I aslced yer.”
ing the head, which faded almost into white,
and a few narrow, pointed streaks of grey
on the neck, which indicated that the freak
was a New Holland honeyeater in unwonted
livery. The usual coloring of this bird is
grey, dark brown and white, with some bars
and other markings of bright yellow. My
bird might have been mistaken at first sight
for an escaped canary, but it had not the
seed-eater’s beak, and there were other
marked points of difference. The canary
does not long survive when liberated in
Australia, several experiments made in Vic-
LOOKING FORWARD.
OLD BROWN ( dreamily ) : “Ah, ah, beautiful
summer! I wonder what the fall will
be like.”
toria about the ’seventies having proved
total failures, the birds soon disappearing.
In one instance the “sport” has, according to
the late Professor Alfred Newton, no mean
authority, become “fixed.” The white gos-
hawk, many ages ago the “sport” of the
grey goshawk, has now become a distinct
species. Similarly a white notornis —almost
exactly identical except in coloring with the"
rare notornis of Maoriland.

“Ziak”: “Sucre’s” load of wool (B.
30/12/’26) would be the weight of a decent
damper compared with that drawn by
Tommy Andrews’s horse-team. There were
105 bales of Biddenham wool in it, and it
was carted to Gharieville, a distance of 6S
miles. The load weighed over 20 tons.
THE WAY TO TUMBLEDOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a smell of gum-leaves burning, and a maggie’s
distant call,
Where the golden-tufted wattles breathe a whisper
over all.
No painted sign-posts urge you; all the roads are
earthy brown ; y ■
There’s a sleepy sort of silence on the way to
Tumbledown.
The men who knew the aching spell of bushland slope
and plain
Will never feel content until they know that spell
again—
The open spaces lure them ; and along the roadways
brown
The old bush-timers wander on the way to Tumble-
down.
The road is worn and drowsy, and slung upon their
baclrs
They carry old Matildas that they waltzed on other
tracks;
They boil their battered billies under blue and
arching skies
Where the kookaburras chuckle and the calling plover
rise.
Oh, the other tracks were harder ; there were stiffer
hills to breast;
There were fewer spells for tucker, there was little
time for rest;
So the swaggies hump their blueys where the grass
is like a gown,
And grey Care slips from their shoulders on the
way to Tumbledown.
And the swagmen as they journey to this heaven of
their own
Dream beside the gleaming campfires of the seasons
that have flown:
They remember how some cattle going south got
out of hand,
When the fenceless routes were verdant from the
border to the Bland.
They remember how a newehum threw a flaring
stick alight,'
And the restless mob went crashing helter-skelter
through the night;
How the tossing horns made havoc ; how the pound-
ing hooves bred fear
In the drovers as they galloped hell-for-leather at
the rear.
A DEGENERATE RAGE,
“Young Jenks dead, eh? Well, well! Seems to me none of the
young fellows these days live as long as us old chaps.”
How the moon shot through the darkness, showed
the blood upon the flanks
Of the cattle as they hurtled down the greasy river
banks; i
How their hides were slashed and reddened, how
the horsemen spurred until
The leaders lagged and faltered and the mastered
mob was still.
And the swagmen as they wander on the way to
Tumbledown
Vision shearing-sheds at Warren with the shearers
mad for town ;
How the combs and cutters hurried and the opened
wool creamed out!
How the woolpress groaned and shivered as the
rousies rushed about!
And again they hear the summons that along the
border-line
Called the bushmen and their horses to a job in
Palestine,
Where Clancys from the Overflow and lads from
Snowy’s side
Met the horsemen out of history—-and taught them
how to ride!
The swagmen vision journeys through an out-back
Western run,
Where the treeless plains are fiery in the scorching
midday sun ;
They remember sluggard rivers where their camp-
fires gleamed at night,
While the moon hung high above them, and the
blazing stars were white.
There’s a smell of gum-leaves burning, and a distant
maggie’s call,
Where the golden-tufted wattles breathe a whisper
over all;
And the swagmen find their kingdom as they tramp
a roadway brown
In the sleepy sort of silence on the way to Tumble-
down.

“V.E.”: I measured a fine tiger-cat,
caught in a rabbit-trap, some little time ago.
It taped a little over 3ft. from tip to tip.
The beast accidentally put its foot in the
trap when hunting for rabbits. This animal
prefers to be its own butcher, and never
(unlike the almost-extinct native-cat—
Dasyurus) descends to carrion ; hence it has
survived, while poisoned rabbit carcases and
baits have practically wiped out the other,
so far as the south coast of N.S.W. is con-
cerned.
* * * *
“Dean”: “Getoora” asks the meaning of
“bri” in abo. names. “Bri” is “plenty.”
Thus, Narrabri signifies plenty of mud, and
Collarenebri plenty of flowers.
* * * *
“Yarri”: I have often watched blacks
standing in water in the Richmond River
(N.S.W.) chopping out cobra —the long
white grubs found in sunken logs. The
cobra, which is always eaten raw, in ap-
pearance resembles macaroni, is soft and
milky, rather palatable and attains a length
of 2ft. The gins used to bring squirming
masses of this raw food to camp in coola-
mons, or bark dishes, and the course was
served in tortoise-shells.
* * * *
“Up North”: South Sea “boys” swear
that Hicks Island is dinkum haunted. The
island’s specialty is the voice in the night—
hosts of voices in corroboree song. They are
heard most frequently during the nor’-west
season, which was the old-time period of
meeting. On still nights come from the
hillocky dancing-grounds the sounds of the
HIS DAY.
“Now, then, m’boay, as ’tes your birthday, ’ee can ’ave pick av
all they pasties. But I’m goin’ ’ave the biggest wan, an’
thee best leave next-biggest, for mawther.”
rhythmic stamp of feet, of the clapping of
the gins, keeping time, and the rise and fall
of chanting voices. The island boys, keen
observers away from their own home, have
been able to repeat a few of the words in a
quite dead tongue. The voices speak irre-
spective of whether there are any live natives
on the island. The ghosts occasionally meddle
in mundane affairs. A white boss has been
awakened by his boys halloing for him.
On walking to their camp he has found them
fast asleep, and they have resolutely denied
that they had called out. On the other hand,
the black laborers have come down to their
boss in the stilly and, awakening him,
have asked what he had coo-eed for.
INDEFINITE.
ISAAC : “Vere arc my glasses, Issy?”
ISSY : “On your nose, fader.”
ISAAC : “Vat part, Issy?”
“Ledraw”: The largest goannas I have
seen in N. S. Wales were on the Lachlan.
Six- and seven-footers were quite common.
About Oxley they used to be called Ken-
nedy’s crocodiles, after a newclium rabbiter
who had ridden into the station and reported
that he had been
chased by a croco-
dile. I remember
going on one occa-
sion to pluck the
wool off some dead
sheep and being
surprised to see
one of the deceased
retreat at a rapid
rate. When I
went up to it I
foir n d that a
goanna -had eaten
liis way into its
body, and with the
exception of its
tail was quite out
sight.

“H e y d e n”:
N.S.W. South
Coast fishermen
have had a bit of
luck lately. Bitan-
gabee Creek is a
small inlet just
north of Green
Cape, where a
small creek empties
into the Pacific.
Trevalley congre-
gate in the mouth
of this inlet in
great schools.
Twice during the
month Eden fisher-
lads made the
launch trip from
Twofold Bay* to
Bitangabee on spec,
and all they had to
do was to stretch
their trawl net across the inlet. The latest
catch is estimated at 1000 baskets. Por-
tion was shipped off to Sydney by the Eden,
and a motor-lorry load of 160 cases went
to catch the Melbourne train at Orbost.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: In his work on Northern
Australia the late Dr. Logan-Jack, giving
the origin of names in the Torres Strait,
says that Marsden Island was named in
honor of the Rev. Samuel Marsden. The
island was put on the map in 1793 or
thereabouts, at about the time that Mars-
den arrived in the ship William; but, since
there seemed to be no particular reason
why the “blacksmith-parson” should be thus
commemorated, I have been digging for;
further information. Captain Bayldon has
now come to light with a statement,
extracted from Markham’s book on Major
James Rennell, to the effect that the Mars-
den whose name the little island carries is
another man altogether, one William Mars-
den, who hailed from Wicklow, was edu-
cated at Trinity College, Dublin, and after
a term of service as a writer in Sumatra
returned to England and established an East
India agency in Gower-street. He became
vice-president of the Royal Society, later on
was second secretary to the Admiralty, and
retired with a pension of £l5OO a year, which
he afterwards resigned. Incidentally, he was
a man of letters, and founded the Raleigh
Club, the precursor of the R.G.S. Point)
Marsden, the north extreme of Kangaroo
Island, bears his name also, his friend Cap-
tain Flinders thus perpetuating his memory.
By the way, no one yet seems to have dis-
covered who named Thursday Island, at the
top of Australia; Tuesday, Wednesday and
Friday Islands have been placed, but not
Thursday.

“Jim Domino”: Arsenical sheep-dips (B.
23/12/’26) require very careful handling.
I sprayed sheep for a fortnight straight
through one severe fly season, and at the
rate of 5000 a day much dip was used. My
hands became tender, the nails were highly
colored and painful to touch, and the arsenic
burns are still on my arms. At the end of
the spraying I was heavy and dull, due, no
doubt, to constant inhalation of the fumes.
“C.G.8.”: Sheep-dip users need not get
“windy” over “EmeFs” par. (B. 23/12/’26).
There were two cases of pneumonic influenza
in the shed prior to the fatal case cited by
him. The lad he mentions died of double-
pneumonia; he did not handle sheep-dip at
all. For the extremities to turn black, as
they did in this case, is not unusual where
pneumonic ’flu has proved fatal.
* * * *
“J.D.C.”: A tally of 700-odd (B.
30/12/’26) is certainly big going for lamb-
marking in these days, but I doubt if it
is a record. In the old days of big holdings
and big mobs a knife expert was expected to
get through from 800 to 1000 an hour as a
regular thing, and we often worked 10
hours a day. However, a percentage of
“stags” and rough tails always resulted, no
dressing was used, many lambs lost their
mothers and occasionally a “goosebellied”
ewe lamb would be slit open in the rush.
That style has been dropped, and with the
present-day system (under which “Tar-
woona’s” tally seems to have been done)
opportunities for big records seldom arise,
nor are they encouraged. Temporary mark-
ing-yards are now erected in the paddocks,
and usually not more than a couple of thou-
sand ewes are yarded at one time. Every
tail is “jointed,” and each lamb is dressed
with some fly preventive as soon as marked.
The smaller mobs assist greatly in more
successful mothering when the job is finished,
but the constant shifting of yards and plant
are against big tallies. There is always a
risk of tetanus when dealing with big mobs
in old yards, and “paddock”-marking on new
ground does away with this to a great,
extent.
* * * *
“S. Q. Whyffe”: No fools like old
fools. Having read lately that the wood-
borer wasp—the pretty orange-tipped one
that makes mudpies in cotton-reels, rifle-
barrels and other handy pokes—has no sting,
and, seeing one near me, I grabbed him.
I did not see any sting, but a fiery stab
in a finger made me release him before
there was time to look. Next mug!
* * * *
“Muggins, Jun.”: At Anakie (Vic.) an
18-year-old cocky was “set” on two bantam’s
eggs, and when the chicks came the bird
looked after them. One died, but the other
survived, and struts round the farmyard
with its talkative foster-parent, taking little
notice of the very apparent jeering of the
other birds.
* * * *
“Ilcrodot” : A farmer in the Lismore dis-
trict (N.S.W.) owns a dog which has devel-
oped the habit of fraternising with the din-
goes in the near-by scrub. He first noticed
that the dog, a big one with a dash of the
bloodhound, was accustomed to go away for
a couple of days at intervals, returning later
in a condition which indicated that it had
been doing some hard hunting. Then, during
one of its periodical absences, a neighbor
was surprised to see it running with three
dingoes, with whom it was apparently hunt-
ing, and later on its owner himself encoun-
tered it with several of its warrigal friends.
He called and whistled to it, but, although
it is greatly attached to him when at home,
the only notice it took was to turn and snarl
at him before vanishing into the bush. Gen-
erally its disappearances are heralded by the
howling of dingoes around the house at
night, and when this happens it is sure to
go off the next day. Recently some dingo-
pups were found in a log not far off, and
they all bore an unmistakable resemblance
to the dog.
* * * *
“Larrapinta” : About a year ago a chap
called “Theo D. Lite” wanted to know how
to stiffen the brim of a felt hat. Nearly all
the replies recommended damping the brim
with sugar and water and then ironing it.
In my opinion it’s a cow of a way. I found
that one shower of rain softened it again,
and if it became damp or wet in the summer
it attracted flies by the million, and Heaven
knows enough of the brutes buzz around a
man’s face on a hot day without putting up
an attraction like that for them. This way,
I’ve found, is miles better. In a teacup
NIPPING HIM IN THE BUD.

tobacco might you be smokin’?”
THE OLD BOSS : “Mah own, my boy-Ah'm
smokin’ mah own.”
of methylated spirits dissolve as much yucca
or spinifex gum as the liquid Avill take.
Place the hat, brim down, on a flat surface,
and pour the gum solution around the brim.
The felt soaks up the spirit like a sponge,
the spirit evaporates in a few minutes, and
the brim is left hard enough to stop a bullet.
And it stays stiff for years—if you can keep
it that long.
A DROVER’S EPITAPH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out west, upon the broad claypan
Where fiercely shines the scorching sun,
I found the grave of a droving man
Whose life was closed ere his race was run.
There’s naught in that, but by his name
I knew him also whence he came.
Where waters flow and fields are green
And rugged snowcapped mountains rise,
Where wealth on every hand is seen
A little cosy hamlet lies —
His home and mine across the sea:
Sweet Fairlie by the Opihi.
The years of youth too quickly pass,
And many far-spread lands I’ve known
Since we moved up from class to class
At school —and here his grave is shown.
But stay! What are these words I scan?
His epitaph—“a gentleman.”
The Western men perhaps are rough,
Yet in description apt and true—
No unearned praise, no cant, no bluff.
Old pal, I lift my hat to you
While on your cross these words I scan:
“Stewart Nixon, a gentleman!”

Moss Vale and Bong Bong were last
week’s social hives; and the old-established
picnic races were run in the joyous weather
that preceded the week-end deluge. True,
a thunderstorm that sounded like a scene in
Hankow broke up the last day of the meet-
ing, but it was so close to the end of the
day that nobody minded the forced retreat
from the field. As at Tirranna the entries
were small, and more than ever Bong Bong
appeared what it really is—a break in the
social boredom of summer for those whose
only activity is to evade boredom. The
Moss Vale Golf Club Ball and the Race
Club Ball filled in the two nights following
the racing; and both wore an * extremely
glittering and well-dressed look. Ethel Camp-
bell and Molly McLeish had been the efficient
secretaries for the first flutter, and their
efforts were rewarded by one of the happiest
dances to the club’s credit. The Elwyn
Blomfields, too (lie’s the Race Club’s presi-
dent), had more than a little to do with
the happy atmosphere that pervaded Bong
Bong. Raters, Ilyries, Osbornes, Blaxlamls
and Throsbys were übiquitous in the cele-
brations ; George Fuller’s lady was one of
the good-lookers both by day and by night;
Sam Hordern’s Doreen and Audrey added
their favorite pinks and blues to the riot
of color; Jean Anderson was one of the
graceful happenings and Mrs. Oscar Paul
one of the smartest; Mrs. Harry Dransfield
alternated lilac and gold frockings of much
distinction, and Mrs. Fred Watson was one
of the few inspired wearers of black.
Eternal hope spurred 23,000 on to Rand-
wick on Saturday in spite of the rain that
poured steadily. You’d think that only a
man with web feet and the name of Mac-
intosh would have paddled through the first
day of the Anniversary meeting, but the
ladies (bless them!) turned out in hundreds.
Macintoslied, goloshed and with umbrellas
unfurled, they waded about the ring.
One woman punter is said to have won her
hundreds, so she can afford enough hankies
for. any number of colds in the head. The
MacCormick lady the Stephen girls, Mrs.
Pat Osborne and Mrs. Norman Pilcher were,
of course, among those present, the first-
named rather pleased over brother Charlie
Cropper’s popularity, which was still further
attested during the afternoon by the pre-
sentation of a gold watch from the trainers
and jockeys.
C. W. Cropper, the secretary of the A.J.C.,
wall be able to do a bit of punting in
Europe when he reaches it in a few weeks’
time. A cheery little wad of one thousand
pounds was thrust into his hand by the
A.J.C. the other day to the accompaniment
of a swelling paean. The bluff and sometimes
gruff secretary has been with the A.J.C.
since 1010, and extraordinary testimonies to
his sense of fair play have been given by
members of every racing club in Sydney,
The A.J.C., Tatt.’s and City Tatt.’s have all
given him parties and presentations, while
the bookmakers expressed their kindly feel-
ing by an illuminated address, one of the
most handsome and valuable ever presented
in Australia. This address is enclosed in a
solid silver frame, picked out in gold, and
on it Mr. Cropper’s monogram glitters and
flashes in diamonds, rubies and sapphires.
And amid the Hallelujahs must not be over-
looked the flight of imagery of the speaker on
behalf of the Flat bookmakers, who described
the guest as having “a heart of gold in a
breast of steel.”
Already the rows have started over the
arrangements for the Royalties’ visit. Sub-
urban aldermen are sniffing at the enter-
tainment committee’s invitation to form
Strong Posts from which will pour forth
patriotic song as T.R.H.’s pass. But
the entertainment committee does not guar-
antee Marrickville or Balmain or any other
municipality foothold on the pavement, and un-
less the songbirds roost out all night how can
they be sure of a perch in the morning? The
councillors in the suburbs have enjoyed their
meetings for the past two weeks and the
discussion of the entertainment committee’s
letter. One naturalist alderman objected to
his colleagues looking like “a set of Oojahs,
standing at a strong post singing.” Another
body pointed out that it contained only one
\\ alter Kirby, and couldn’t have him sub-
jected to the possibility of throat strain. The
only cheerful note came from a peaceful-
looking man who said he guessed that if his
particular civic family once got possession
of a stand, they could hold it against all
comers. Meanwhile a conflagration more
scorching than any bush fire is raging in
aldermanic homes on the Blue Mountains.
For while father is to meet the Ducal party,
no arrangements have been made for the
Duke to lift his golden crown to mother and
the girls.
According to John Lemmone, Melba’s
forthcoming Australian tour will mark the
end of her public appearances. Her manager
and old friend declares: “It will be the finish
for both of us. Yes, really and truly, we
shall both retire after this year.”
Gone to the land where there is neither
marrying nor giving in marriage, Canon
Bellingham, of St. Philip’s, one of the
fashionable matrimonial smithies of Church
Hill. For 39 years the robust Canon had
labored in the diocese, and was one of the
city’s best-known and most scholarly clergy
men. On Thursday of last week he passed
through the gateway, and Archbishop Wright
and liis very old friend Bishop D’Arcy Irvine
sped him on the great journey.
Pretty little Marjorie Pridham, one of
the most popular of Bradley's Head blooms,
played principal lady at a wedding last week.
Roy Copeland, of Mapleton (Q.), was the
happy young man who exchanged the matri-
monial dialogue with her, with Padre Yarring-
ton to make suitable interjections. A full
set of choristers preceded Marjorie up St.
Clement’s Church, and father’s arm steered
her along the aisle with its pink and white
decorations. Ivory crepe de Chine and
silver lace made a wedding garment of great
charm, and two maids, Enid Pridham and
Jessie Me William, added georgettes, the cool
pink of water-melon and the blue of delphini-
ums, to the procession. Nether ton, the Prid-
eaux Pridham home at Clifton Gardens, was
a bower of pink and white flowers for the
Party, and here the bride’s mother dispensed
hospitality to half or so of the youth of
Bradley’s Head.
Limerick lace over shell-pink georgette
clothed Berenice (Berry) Parker, of Vau-
cluse, when she became Mrs. Harold Waugh
Fletcher, of this State’s Kentucky. St.
Mark’s at Darling Point saw the vow ex-
change, and was gay with gold pedestal
baskets in which pensive pink gladioli were
massed. The chancel, too, was hedged with
pink carnations growing thickly from long,
low boxes. Four golden girls in a cloud of
georgettes stepped after the bride, th.eir
sheaves of golden roses and gladioli like
so many censers to Hymen. Taranaki,
the home of the bride’s mother, Mrs. L. Par-
ker, echoed to the sußsequent rejoicings.
The pleasant-faced lady in this May Moore
picture is Mrs. Orames, who represents the
interests o f
the many Sal
vation Army
Homes foi
Women and
Children i n
such associa-
tions as the
Royal Wel-
fare Society
and the Racial
Hygiene Cen-
tre. She is
also convener
of the Na-
tional Council
of the body
that watches
women’s immi-
gration and a
vice - president
of the newly-
formed Tra-
vellers’ A i d
Society. Mrs.
Orames brings to her work the spirit that
made the Salvation Army so popular with
the Digger; and, indeed, it was while her
chaplain husband was out shepherding his
flock in the war zone that Mrs. Orames took
up the public work for which she is so well
fitted. She hails from the west coast of
Maoriland, and no more unselfish soul,
full of sympathy and understanding, ever
came out of that soggy land.
Eaditli Rowe, of Manly, met Dr. Richard
Vallack in the chapel of “Shore” Grammar
School one day last week, and by Benefit
of Padre Davies the two were made one.
Both bride and ’groom belong to old New
South Wales families. Her grandfathers
were Colonel Rowe and the Rev. D. Hul-
bert, while lie brought a smack of the
Church also to the nuptials, one grandfather
being the Rev. Roger Mackinnon. Soft
white satin clothed this bride; the sleeves
were knuckle length, and a train that hesi-
tated into a drape at the waistline was an
added grace. A mist of tulle and an arm-
ful of glowing red roses rounded off an
attractive picture. Two ’maids in sea-blue
taffetas, served with black hats and red roses,
were in the bride’s train.
Kathleen (Jimmie) Badgery, in a frock
that suggested silver moonbeams, murmured
the usual responses at St. James’s when
asked her intentions regarding Dudley
Charles Gardyne, of Mosman. The bride,
who is the youngest daughter of the James
Badgerys, of Bombala, had sister Judy as
attendant, and her frock was a heady affair
of cyclamen georgette and lace. The bride’s
parents afterwards did the right thing by
the guests at the Ambassadors.
A pretty young amateur actress of Syd-
ney, Flora Maliood, found romance lurking
amid the backcloths. Thomas Henry, of
Lindfield, found it at the same moment, so
the two have decided to go into life-partner-
ship to exploit their discovery. Both are
members of the Players’ Club.
As some people make a study of the
growth of prize roses, the subject of this pic-
ture makes a
study of the
growth of
prize children.
She is Mary
V'auglian Jen-
kins, and her
job is with
the Depart-
ment of Mater-
nal and Baby
Welfare, per-
haps the most
important
branch of the
Public Health
Department.
Before coming
to work under
the eye of Dr.
Morris, Miss
Jenkins, who
is a trainee
of Prince
Alfred’s, had
taken a course in obstetrics, and had also
qualified as a sanitary inspector in London.
Sanitary inspecting, by the way, in that
connection has nothing directly to do with
dustbins. It is a very important subject
concerned with ante- and post-natal care.
The very well run and much patronised
Baby Health Department at the recent Ideal
Homes Exhibition was in charge of this
good Australian. Elizabeth Mahony made
the picture of her.
The Minister of Justice has decided to
keep Mrs. Dorothy Mort under lock and key.
Five or six years have elapsed since she
shot Dr. Tozer with fatal results, made an
unsuccessful attempt at suicide, and then
received the indefinite sentence which is
handed to the temporarily or permanently
insane. It is alleged that she has fully
recovered, and could be safely consigned to
the care of her family. If she was insane
when she committed the crime, and is sane
now and likely to remain sane, she should
be at once released. To argue otherwise
would be to argue that the mentally afflicted
should be punished for their affliction. And
as the question of her insanity then cannot
be raised now—a jury has decided on that
point—the only question is one of her pre-
sent and probable future mental condition.
That point a jury of doctors should decide.
Agnes Murphy’s note from London :
Dame Mary Cook’s farewell party to the other
Dame, the Madame Melba of more glorious days,
drew a variegated assembly to Australia House on
December 8. On the nomination of the guest of
honor, Dame Mary invited a number of Melba’s
particular friends, including Lord Richard Nevill,
Lady Alington, Mrs. Fred Payne and Miss Stella
Murray. Others who attended were the still-beautiful
Lady Grey Egerton, Mrs. Pat Osborne, Evelyn Scot-
ney, Dr. and Mrs. Gwynne Hughes and Mrs. Gwynne
Hughes’s sister Mrs. Francesco Toni. All the Agents-
General and their families accepted invitations; so
did Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Mason, Lady Weigall, Lady
Jersey, Lady Chelmsford, Stanley and Mrs. Bruce,
Mark Sheldon and his lady, Edmund Barton’s widow,
Landon Ronald, Mr. and Mrs. Browning Mummery,
Mr. and Mrs. C. H. Chomley, Mrs. George Chirnside
and Kevin Tait. On the following Sunday Melba
gave a dinner at the Savoy at which Violet Duchess
of Rutland, Lady .Susan Birch, Mrs. George Arm-
strong and Lord Richard Nevill were the intimates.
Lord Richard with an enhanced stoop looks leaner
than ever.
The committee of the Big Brother Ball
is doing its best to have a splash of Navy
gold at the Ambassadors on March 30. Invi-
tations to the captain of the Renown and 50
of his officers have been mailed to Suva. The
ball will not be the only money-raiser for
the movement; a series of minor junketings,
among them dances by private hostesses and
a cabaret at the Ambassadors on February 1,
are freshets to swell the silver stream.
Mrs. Archie Ashdown passed out a few
days ago at the age of 84. In old times
no charity movement in Sydney was com-
plete without her willing help. She had a
real talent for money-raising—-was, in fact,
the Raffle-Queen. Then rheumatism un-
crowned her, and for the past 10 years she
had been laid aside.
The final curtain fell on one of the black-
est tragedies of modern history when the
one-time Empress Charlotte of Mexico died
at Brussels last week. A daughter of that
Leopold of Belgium who was young Queen
Victoria’s uncle and confidant, she married
Maximilian of Austria, and saw him installed
as Emperor of Mexico in 1864 by Napoleon
111., who undertook to maintain liis protege
with French bayonets. When these were
withdrawn in the face of all pledges, a
rebellion, in which Porfirio Diaz took a
prominent part, overthrew the dream empire.
Maximilian was shot in true Mexican
fashion, and his distraught widow became
insane, remaining so till her death nearly
70 years later —she was 87 when she died.
The death of the wife of Judge Fitz-
hardinge which happened last week recalls
that when the lady’s son, Dr. John Fitz-
hardinge, heard the war-call he left his wife
as locum tenens in his practice at Pam-
bula. Before her marriage she was Dr.
Clara Smith, a graduate of her husband’s
own year in medicine.
For over 80 years two pals sat side by
side at any match of importance on Sydney
Cricket Ground. They were Major C. B.
Airey and Colonel Fred Baynes. “Good old
Baynes,” as he was known for many long
years in the R.A.G., recently passed beyond
the sound of .the batsman’s smack at a
bounding ball, and only intimate friends and
the pal of half a lifetime walked behind his
coffin. At his own wish there was no pomp
of a military funeral. After 26 years on
the retired list he wanted to go unattended
except by such friends as lie named to the
great roll-call. Australian-born, his dad was
a British soldier who joined the old perma-
nent forces in N. S. Wales.
General-manager Dendy, of the Manly
Ferries, who leaves this week for Jvondon,
has a problem to solve for his company. As
the harbor bridge grows steadily, the ferry
companies wonder more and more what the
effect of the spider-web of steel will be—
will it kill ferry transit or increase it? The
Manly company is looking ahead to the time
when an electric-train service will serve
Manly from the city. The chances are that
faster boats will be needed, giving a 26-
minute service from the Quay, in order to
compete with the trains in the misty future.
Motor-’bus transit will be a factor, too, long
before the railways can be built.
From the south of France:—
Mentone, always a favorite with English-speaking
visitors, has had an unusual number of Australians
for so early in the year. As the season is still
young there is no very chic dressing on the
promenades. The most outstanding exception is a
pretty girl, probably a mannequin, who was dressed
in harmonising tints of golden browns, with very
full knickerbockers of tan silk showing about three
inches below her skirt, the latter very little longer
than her cigarette-holder. But (so greatly has
fashion changed) she was the only woman smoker
on the beach.
Brisbane’s message:—
“Abie’s Irish Rose” is to re-open the long-closed
doors of His Majesty’s this week, Cremorne is
finishing up the pantomime, and at the Empire the
Charleston Six are proving that a turn can run
successfully for more than the two weeks generally
allotted to public favor in Brisbane. The Whirli-
gigs are still whirling, despite high temperatures
and as much rain as coastal Queensland has room
for.
Mrs. Harry Cameron had a farewell party for
Winifred Ponder, one of our singing and writing
ladies who left by the Houtman on the first stage
of the journey to the Cold Country, where Dame
Clara Butt is to entertain her. The Women’s Club
was decked with red roses, and original place cards
designed by Mrs. Cameron were on the tables. The
guest of honor sang several songs.
Marion Cochrane, the new Head of the Kelvin
Grove Kindergarten College, came from Sydney on
the 20th and was met by Miss Bedford. College
girls had arranged a tea to follow in a garden of
blossomry.
At the Glenellen homestead,. Long)each, William
G. H. Price signed on Mollie L. Pitman for a life
job. The Rev. Brown Beresford witnessed the bar-
gain. The bride, whose parents are in London, was
given away by Ingram Reid, of Pandora Park; she
wore white satin, and cap and veil finished with
rosebuds, and carried pink and white roses.
Madame Pianoff, a Russian, who arrived in Bris-
bane by the St. Albans this week, tells the usual
tale of suffering under Bolshevik rule. Married
before she was 20, she had two children; her husband
joined the Whites, and in 1918 had to fly to save
his life. For eight years she had not seen him, but
he awaited her in Australia. In the meantime,
though, one of her children had died. Australia
seems to them something of a Promised Land now.
St. Hilda’s Old Girls poured the cup at the
Jenolan Cafe for Phyllis Mackenzie Shaw, who will
soon be married. Miss Bourne, who was headmistress
at St. Hilda’s, presented the bride-to-be with a case
of spoons. Phyllis Mackenzie Shaw, who was at
one time on the staff of the school, was frocked in
crepe-de-Chine rosewood, with hat to match.
George Brooke and Eddie Cahill go to America
by the Sonoma on April 9. In February they will
give a series of recitals in Brisbane.
At the Albert-street Methodist Church, Reginald
Peate, son of the T. Lewis Peates of Killara, Sydney,
lassoed Kathleen Highfield with the help of a gold
ring and the Rev. Joseph Bowes. She is daughter
of the late Charles Highfield and of Mrs. High-
field, Paddington Heights. Her brother, Jackson
Highfield, gave her away in ivory mariette with
touches of pink, and she wore a tiny spray. of
orange blossom, worn by her mother on her marriage
day. Her ivory crin. hat was trimmed with pink
rosebuds and lace. Doreen Fletcher, Joyce Fletcher
and Joan Highfield ’maided in pink. There was a
reception at the bride’s home in a setting of pink
roses.

The finest sight at Moonee Valley races
on Saturday was Heroic, looking in per-
fect form, with coat shining as a copper
newly minted, and the big crowd gave the
champion a wonderful welcome before and
after he won the William Reid Stakes. A
decided crispness in the breeze caused the
dress-circle to return to furs in necklet
form, and the kasha-cloth frock was much
in favor. The summer season was suggested
by the crop of sunshades of all sizes and
colors and crosses thereof. Those from
Japan were of the tiniest, in oiled paper;
the larger makes were more ornate, being
fancifully patterned, many glistening with
a frosting of beads. Walking-sticks were
also in the running. Vagabond felt hats
topped most covering, whether silk, cotton
or woollen, and there were lots of jumper
suits. Spotted materials ran riot, and the
markings pranced from the size of a tliree-
penny-pieoe to that of the circle of a bull’s-
eye lantern. Red and black were first favo-
rites, though it was not the colors that
caught the judge’s eye first.
Society was not numerous, the attractions
of hills and sea still being alluring; and the
championship tennis matches also claimed
some of the turf’s customary patronage. The
Lebbie Horderns were on the lawn, she wear-
ing a natural kasha frock with coat in black
and green, allied to a green hat. Mrs.
George Barraud, who was of the Moses clan
of Sydney, was with them, her bois-de-rose
felt hat accompanying a grey suit. Mrs.
Jack Merrillees, who was with her doctor,
wore cool raiment that had groups of spot-
tings in mauve and pink, shaded by a rustic
straw hat. Something rather unique in
covering was a white satin jumper bordered
with fur and banded in bronze and gold
embroidery, which had accompaniment of a
black pleated skirt with gold thread orna-
mentation.
After a somewhat rough passage the Nal-
dera put in on Monday morning with Dame
Nellie Melba aboard looking as bright as ever,
notwithstanding that she had had her temper
tried by an injured toe. Of course she
was besieged by press people, relations and
musical folk, including the ever-faitliful
John Lemmone, the Fritz Harts and the
staff and students of the Albert-street Con-
servatorium. The Jimmy Dyers represented
the British Music (Society and Alberto
>mlman the Melbourne Philharmonic. . The
diva wore caped raiment of sand hue, ropes
of pearls and diamonds and a small brown
hat. She was duly bowed off the ship by the
captain and officers.
Melba is booked for farewell concerts from
about March to September, with a spell
during the Royal visit here. One concert in
Melbourne on March 2 is to be followed by
appearances in Hobart and Launceston. Then
there are to be farewells in the western dis-
trict of Victoria, with the season in Sydney
starting on April 9. This brings the lady
back to Melbourne for the Royal invasion.
John Lemmone; Stuart Robertson, a bari-
tone from abroad, due here at the end of
February; and our own good Australian
pianist Lindley Evans are to be the support-
ing artists.
Coombe Cottage has been brushed and
combed for the coming of the Dame. There
has been great laundering of curtains and
covers, and unpacking of furniture, glass,
and bric-a-brac from just received-from-
abroad cases, all to be in readiness when the
Queen of Song again entered her dominions.
New gates even were put into position at the
entrance, and less formidable ones were
scattered over the broad acres; Dame Nellie
seems to have been collecting gates. Enlarg-
ing the ballroom is to be the diva’s first
interest, for it is said the Duke and Duchess
will see how magnificently the world’s star
has dug herself in in her own homeland.
All Avas rosy at the Australian tennis
championship gathering on Saturday at Koo-
yong Courts, for the new L.T.A.V. stand
was opened, the day was radiant, and, to
keep in tune, bois-de-rose and tones of pink
were prominent in the upholstery of fair
patrons. The occasion was marked by a
special official lunch, for at Kooyong will
now be etaged all big matches; and a com
memorative tablet was unveiled at the almost
completed concrete stand, which is to hold 4500
spectators, and is reckoned by president Nor-
man Brookes the equal of any such thing in
the world. Leo Cussen echoed the president's
sentiments. About 3000 people saw the
interesting play, which had as a curtain-
raiser an exhibition match in which the for-
mer champion partnered Gerald Patterson
against J. B. Hawkes and P. O’Hara Wood.
Mrs. Norman Brookes, who was accompanied
by her trio of small daughters, aired a suit
of frisca-cloth in tones of pink and mauve,
with a cyclamen felt hat. Mrs. R. Harper
cheered a navy frock with mushroom pink,
and Gerald Patterson’s wife had a shiny
Pandan hat above apparel of wood-brown
and beige. Mrs. P. O’Hara Wood blended a
grey gown and green millinery. Dorothy
Aklmrst (Sydney), W. T. Rowe (S.A.),
A. Robertson (S.A.) and President Frew, of
Bananaland’s Tennis Association were some
of the inter-Staters who looked on. In con-
nection with the tennis invasion, the Norman
Brookes couple had a garden-party on Sun-
day at their holiday home at Frankston.
The nearly-new State Governor was asked
in to push off this year’s conference of State
teachers, which differed from all previous
gatherings inasmuch as this time all sections,
primary, high and technical, had representa-
tion. The welding of three associations will,
it is hoped, add to the strength of the appeal
that may presently be made to the Arbitra-
tion Court. Most of last week’s discussions
had a habit of drifting to the question of
better salaries; the second and third horses
were Furlough and Institute. Lord Somers,
who isn’t quite a stranger to the ways of
Education Departments, since in the Lords
in England he represented the Board of Edu-
cation, reckoned the teaching profession was
close up the highest that man or woman
could follow. School marms arid masters
thought they had heard this before, and won-
dered whether the virtue of engaging in such
a high calling was expected to be its own
reward. His Excellency also commented
upon the number of ex-service men he had
noticed in bis travels among the country
schools, and congratulated them on their
further service to their country.
The lass with the roguish eyes, pictured
here by Lafayette, is Rona Stephens, who
has success-
fully opened
up a new
career for
women. She
is a builder
in miniature,
and frequently
takes up her
house and
walks, becom-
ing thereby a
subject of in-
teresting
amusement to
the small
people. Want-
ing a job, and
nursing a dis-
like for routine
office work,
she persuaded
a firm of
architects and
build ers to
employ her. They taught her the elements
of building-construction, and then, after two
years, went out of business. Their enter-
prising pupil determined to carry on as a
maker of architectural models. Behind the
family home at Kew an outhouse has been
converted into a studio, and there, with
cardboard and scissors, are fashioned mid-
gets of proposed spacious dwellings. She
has had no lack of commissions, and just now
is at work on quite a wholesale contract —
models for an extensive subdivision at Gee-
long.
The friendly Union of Soldiers’ Wives
and mothers said au revoir last week to
Mrs. Victor 'Sellheim, who had directed
the social side of this band of women during
the war. A silver tea-and-coffee service and,
of course, some flowers were passed over
to the life member of the union by the
president, General Chauvel’s lady, with
thanks for services and good wishes, added
to some personal remarks of one old friend
to another, since the Selllieims were present
at the wedding in Queensland of the Harry
Chauvels. As a tribute to the nationality
of the departing lady, the Welsh Anthem,
“The Laud of My Fathers,” was sung by
Cardiff Morgan. There was an ornate
souvenir programme, the cover bearing the
red-and-blue badge of the union, and a boom-
erang with the picture of Mrs. Sellheim:
and her farewell message in leaflet form
was also circulated. The lady, whose grey
embroidered gown had a cape showing a
cherry-satin lining and a Paisley-pat-
terned border, said her thanks, and
also took the opportunity of letting the rest
of Aussie know the extraordinary kindness
of the Fuller Bros, and Hugh Ward to this
body of soldiers’ wives and mothers since its
inception ; and the lady also nut on record
the generosity of the Wirth Bros., who also
have not yet forgotten the war. In the
course of her leave-taking she mentioned that
her husband would occupy the same posi-
tion at Norfolk Island as his grandfather
did a century ago, and they would reside in
the home in which his mother was born.
Dr. Kate Mackay is rejoicing at being
included in the delegation that is going to
U.S.A. to learn as much as possible of our
cousin’s way of dealing with all problems
pertaining to industrial life. For the past
15 months the youthful healer has had the
job of Woman Medical Inspector of Fac-
tories—'the first appointment of the kind in
Australia. She only collected her medical
degree at the local shop in 1922, winning
first-class honors and adding the M.D. in
1924. Prior to being handed her present
interesting job, she was resident at the
Melbourne Women’s and Children’s hospitals.
The well-known local teachers of voice-
production, the Harold Browning couple, in
conjunction with Plunkett Greene, of London,
whose forte is

Mary Grant Bruce said a long farewell
to old friends, many of them also pen-
women, when she boiled the billy at the
Lyceum Club prior to moving camp with
her husband and small sons to the Emerald
Isle. The writer of Aussie’s best-sellers
for the rising generation presided over the
final brew in apparel of black and
white topped by wide-leafed millinery banded
with blue velvet. A bit of home was handed to
her in a posy of wild hyacinths, arranged
in a basket of bush bark, fashioned by the
artistic lingers of Henrietta Walker.
City wayfarers last week were intro-
duced to their first taxiet —a motor-cycle
with a hooded side-car. Pedestrians gazed
upon the dinky conveyance with delight, for
the miniature sedan suggested the fairy-
coach of Cinderella, though large enough
to hold two adults. Popular makes of
“baby” autos seemed massive against the
new coach, which is but the forerunner of
a fleet.
“Subscribed” can be written against
the appeal for £50,000 towards the finishing
of St. Paul’s Cathedral, and the steeple and
towers can now mount heavenwards, with
hopes of more next year.
Melbourne’s most lavish hostess will be
an absentee during the Ducal visit. Mrs.
Leslie Stuart is at present at Portsea,
entertaining a gay house-party, but
next month will see her pulling down the
blinds at Toorak; with daughters Nan and
Lavender she is booked for an early March
sailing, and there are hints of a trousseau-
hunting abroad.
Miss S. Ilayhoe, an interesting figure in
the educational life of Ballarat, crossed the
Great Divide the other day. For 30 years
Miss Haylioe, with her co-worker, Miss Lar-
ritt. trained Victorian girls at the C. of E.
Girls’ Grammar School, which in its infancy
was known as Queen’s College. The lady,
who had reached her 70th year, had lately
been living in retirement.
Two minds with but a single thought,
and that thought architecture, will get
together when Lorn a Lee, second daughter of
the J. E. Lees, of Smithton, Tasmania, says
the promised “I will” to Gordon E. E. Gib-
bon, of Ivew. The lass won her diploma at
the Melbourne University, and is, besides, an
A.R.V.I.A.
Dorothy Scantlebury is returning to Kenya
Colony in Africa next month, but not to her
Government job; she is booked to keep a
matrimonial contract with Darell Smyly
Wardle, who is stationed in those parts.
The J. A. Safe couple, of Kew, had a party
over the just-announced matrimonial inten-
tions of Patrick Cody and a dark-eyed col-
leen, Kathleen Dillon, of East Malvern. Pat,
who is second son of the Pierce Codys, of
Kew, is in “the wine-and-spirits,” and mainly
responsible for “Old Court” getting a place
in the Popularity Stakes. His bride-elect
is one of a quartette of pretty sisters; to
Kathleen ever since the death of her father
and mother have fallen the duties of head
of the home.
The M. H. Quinns’ second daughter Joyce
Mary, has said the right word to Ernest
Darby Blythe Keats, younger son of Mrs
Keats, of Coberamunga station, Kerang.
The announcement that “the Lord taketh
no pleasure in a man’s legs” has lately been
made in bold print outside a Collins-street
church. It sounded like another attack on
the abbreviated feminine kilt of the moment,
and scores of people are rummaging out their
mislaid copies of Holy Writ to discover the
authority.
A note from over the Strait:—
Even Hobart thermometers have been doing their
best. One day this year they proudly recorded 95
in the shade; and then we sat back complacently
fanning ourselves with the never-failing afternoon
sea breeze from Antarctica and waited. Alas, all
hopes of scoring a top place vanished—Adelaide had
registered 110, and all the other capitals had passed
the century. Still, 95 is not bad for Hobart; the
best for four years, anyway.
The tourist traffic this summer is a record, too.
. though the “tourists” are mostly short-trip folks
from the mainland cities, whose average stay in the
island is not more than a couple or three weeks.
The fact that Tasmania’s roads are still, despite
heavy motor traffic, the best in the Commonwealth, is
bringing grjst to the mills of enterprising Mel-
bourne transport entrepreneurs, whose chars-a-bancs,
carrying from 16 to 20 round-trip passengers, booked
in the Victorian capital for the trip across the
Strait, through and around the isle and back to
Varraside, may be seen whirling through clouds of
dust on many a Tasmanian highway where formerly
cows and chooks might walk sedately and in perfect
safety. Of the Speck’s 12,000 miles of road, no
less than 9000 (or 75 per cent.) are hard-surfaced.
Vlaoriland roads are 40 per cent, hard-surfaced; those
,f the United States only 13.4 per cent.
Among recent travellers to Europe was
Miss Agnes Donaldson, sister of Dr. Bar-
bara Donaldson, who is bound for Edin-
burgh to take her final degree in medicine.
Miss Mary Lush, who is connected with
kindergarten work in Melbourne, was a
fellow-passenger on a health trip.
The Australian Women’s National
League, which mustn’t be confused -with the
National Council of Women, is losing the
services of a much-valued president, Mrs.
H. S. Crocker. After 17 years’ work in its
interests, in which she has played many lead-
ing roles, she is calling a halt, and Mrs.
Couchman has stepped into the vacant shoes
for the time being.
The horticultural setting for a tea given
by Dr. Barbara Cameron at the Lyceum
Club on Saturday afternoon was a sight to
behold. Great masses of watsonias and blue
agapanthus, mingled with less imposing
groupings of delphiniums, gladioli and pink
carnations, gave greeting to a trio of guests
of honor—Mrs. Gwen Newton ; Miss Cam-
eron, of Firbank C. of E. Grammar School,
Brighton; and Adelaide Allan. All have
just returned from abroad. Mrs. Newton,
who is a sister of Miss Elsie Morres, of the
Hermitage School at 1 Geelong, teaches arts
and crafts work at several colleges; while
on the Continent she added to her store of
knowledge, and with Miss Cameron attended
also the League of Empire Education Con-
ference in Paris.
A word from London :
Before these lines can reach Australia, the marriage
will have taken place of Dr. Daniel Mulcahy, eldest
son of Mrs. Mulcahy, of Fremantle (W.A.), and
Mary Josephine Delaney, daughter of Mrs. Delaney
of Mount Eagle, Ireland. The date fixed is Australia's
National Holiday.
The Ranee of Pudukota, one-time Mollie Fink, of
Australia, who has lately taken an active part in
London charity schemes, has left with the Rajah for
their Riviera home, the Villa La Favorita, one of
the most picturesque residences in the exclusive
quarter of Cannes.
Sister Adelaide’s P.S.: —
Polo has been the only thing to ripple the surface
of our social calm, and even polo is reduced to its
lowest terms, in quantity if not quality, by the
exodus to Caramut.
From Mandalay comes news of the marriage of
Airlie, daughter of the late Peter Haggard, to Capt.
J. F. Williams, of the Burma Rifles, with the sub-
sequent toast-drinking at the Upper Burma Club
under the wing of the bride’s sister, Mrs. J. Mitton.
And a local wedding has launched us into a flutter
of preliminary festivities—lunches and teas and
dinners and the rest for Yvonne Tolley, who makes
her home in Melbourne after her marriage at the
end of the week.
Gone west, the Rev. Hartley Williams, who had
played in politics as an interlude to various Anglican
incumbencies. He was on the staff of the Liberal
organisation at one time.
What with space allotted and a design approved,
it seems as though we may get a war memorial while
someone still lives who remembers what it is to
commemorate. The design, more sculptural than
architectural, is to have £25,000 spent on it —and
the result depends entirely on how good a man can
be got for the sculptured groups.
Kooyonga golfers are extending their club house,
completing the ground floor and spending about
£3OOO. The additions include dining-room, lounge,
dressing-rooms, etc., and will leave some of the
original rooms free for members’ bedrooms.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
So much rain fell in Sydney on Saturday
morning, and so patent it was that there would be
more in the afternoon, that most people were pre-
pared to hear there would be no races at Randwick.
However, the A.J.C. committee doesn’t care for
postponements, and, the course being reported fit to
race on —it is wonderfully well drained —the meeting
was held. No. 4 on the card having won the
Hurdle (Pompene at 3 to 1), the Three-year-old
Handicap (Linally, 5 to 1), and the First Nursery
(Sir Allan, 7 to 2), No. 4 in the Challenge Stakes
—Persuasion, as it happened—came into increased
favor, but most of the 13 starters were substantially
backed. When Mt.Shortodds shut his bag it was 9
to 2 Persuasion, 5 t<s 1 Lovebox, 7 to 1 Calmest,
8 to 1 Garrula, 10 Chrystal and Periwoo, 12 Quixotic
and Acneid, and 16 Janitor, Don Moon (25) being
the outsider of the party.
Calmest and Don Moon suffered at the start,
Calmest tarrying hopelessly and Don Moon being
left lengths. Bairn made the early running, but
was done with two furlongs from home, where
Persuasion, Garrula and Periwoo were together.
Garrula disposed of the: other two after a stiff fight,
but Don Moon, who had made up a lot of ground
in the run to the home turn, came strongly on the
outside and won by two or three lengths from the
Vic. horse, Periwoo being third, Persuasion fourth,
Orient Princess, Chrystal and Lovebox next, and
the very harshly treated Bairn, who was asked to
carry 9st. lOlb. , in a handicap framed on a light
scale, last. The time for the six furlongs was
lmin. 14|.sec.
Don Moon is owned and trained by Bob Bailie,
who had David early in that grand old horse’s career,
and was ridden by Daniels. A hardy little four-year-
old bay gelding by Don Reynaldo—Full Moon, he
had met with a few successes in second- and third-
rate company, but few thought him capable of
beating a Challenge Stakes field. Either he has
greatly improved or the sprinters racing about
Sydney these days are not much good. Bailie gave
McShortodds another pleasant surprise in the Holiday
Handicap, 10 furlongs, wherein Solomon (20 to 1),
a common-looking chestnut stallion by Baverstock,
sire of David, out of Polly Pry, got the best of a
close finish with Piastoon (16 to 1), Sea Risk (10)
and Attractive (10). Piastoon’s was a sterling per-
formance, considering that he carried 9st. in heavy
going and led nearly all the way, and the Queens-
landers’ high opinion of him will be justified in
Sydney, barring accidents.

The Moonee Valley club got an exciting
race and a great attendance for its enterprise in
putting on the William Reid Stakes, a six-furlong
w.f.a. event with penalties and allowances, for
which a £llOO purse was hung up, on Saturday.
Early hopes that Manfred and Top Gallant would
oppose Heroic were not fulfilled; but the command-
ing chestnut had seven opponents, and two did
uncommonly, well. The bookmakers at first demanded
a shade of odds, but there was plenty of evens at
the finish. Comus, in receipt of 91b., was next in
demand at 7 to 2, Quintus (receiving 121 b.) being
at 6to 1 and Perspective at 12 to 1. The favorite
got away well and was in front on the rails soon
after the start, with Comus, Metellus and Quintus
nearest of the others. At the half-mile post Comus
was just behind Heroic, and they entered the
straight almost on terms. Heroic gradually drew
away from the English horse and, despite a good
finishing run on the part of Quintus, won very com-
fortably by three-quarters of a length from the
Standish Handicap winner, who was half a neck
ahead of Comus. Perspective was fourth and Red
Gauntlet last. His 9st. 10lb. notwithstanding, the
son of Valais —Chersonese covered the six furlongs
in lmin. 12isec., establishing a course record.
Comus was saddled up again for the Caldermeade
Handicap 10 furlongs—a curious proceeding, con-
sidering that he had the welter weight of lOst. 51b.
less apprentice’s allowance. He was made favorite,
too, and rushed to the front, but the previous race
had been too much for him, and he was beaten a
long way from home. Abdera (7 to 2) was first
into the straight, but little Reputed King (12 to 1)
took charge inside the distance and won well by a
length from Raith (8 to 1), with Corncrake (6
to 1) third again. Reputed King, who has raced
on the pony courses, has proved a goldmine to his
owner, D. Marks, this season. Ashley Reid, previ-
ously successful on Byron (6 to 1) in the Two-
vear-old, rode the small fellow a nice race.

“Ike Mcßagg” : The sorrows of the Aus-
tralian bookmaker are well known to those who
read our racing press after a settling-day, and
things seem to be even worse in Old England, where
a betting tax has encroached on the one-time tradi-
tions of the Brave and the Free. The Turf Guardian
Society, an organisation which exists to protect the
hapless odds-layer from ravening punters and other
birds of prey, has published a statement to the
effect that betting has dropped 75 per cent, owing
to the tax. As a result, instead of the six millions
which Winston Churchill hopes to tear from the
suffering Ring and its clients this financial year, he
will be lucky to get two millions. In addition, the
revenue will suffer by losing the rents of 600 tele-
phones already surrendered by destitute s.p. mer-
chants, and there will be a raid on the dole by
their 250 sacked attendants. It is a tragic prospect
altogether.

“J. 11.” (Loud.) : Stove Donoghue was
foolhardy when he risked an income of from £lO,OOO
to £15,000 a year by riding in a hurdle race at
Lingfield. The venture was the outcome of a
HE’D TACKLE ANYTHING.
PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER: “Is he a willing lad?”
RETIRED PUG.: “Willin’! I’ll hack him ag’in anythink in ’ees class, sport, give or take
two pound.”
dinner-table bet. Steve all but took a toss, and his
mount, which started favorite, ran nowhere. It
cost the veteran £25 by way of special insurance.
Although he hasn’t headed the jockeys’ winning
list for the past two or three seasons, Donoghue is
still in a class by himself. Nowadays he prefers to
ride as a freelance, although he could name his own
figure for retainers as first jockey to half a dozen
leading owners. I have met Steve often; he is a
man of rare charm, and has a wonderful gift of
anecdote. His record of riding three successive
Derby winners may stand for centuries.
* * * *
Roy Moore, the third member of Patsy
Burke’s U.S. team to face a Sydney fight crowd, is
quite as eccentric in the ring as when he wanders
round the city in his tame cowboy act. At the
Stadium on Saturday night, scaling list. 31b. and
looking pretty fit, the cow-puncher from Arizona
punched Billy Edwards, of Newcastle, into dream-
land in 10 rounds. Edwards entered the ring weigh-
ing list. BJib., 2Jib. above legitimate middleweight,
and exhibiting a roll of fat over the pressure-band
of his green shorts, together with sundry angry
“hives.” It had leaked out that he had “trained”
only four days for the match; nevertheless Arizona
had made so feeble an impression on followers of
the game that Edwards was favorite at 3 to 1 on.
The “fight” was farcical. Moore seemed less intent
on making a mill of it than on contriving to finish
each round in his own corner, where Burke always
had the chair swung in just in time to receive its
burden, who never never looked round to sec if it
was there. This trick brought laughter at first, but
the crowd grew tired of it and made unkind remarks
about both pugs. For the first eight rounds Edwards
did all the work, though he wasted dozens of blows
on the other chap’s arms and let him off repeatedly
when openings as wide as a railway-crossing gate
were obvious to any watchful eye. In the ninth
Moore made a bit of a flutter by attacking for a
few seconds ; the rest of the time he had been lean-
ing on the ropes and grappling for dear life. Early
in the tenth he was bent over the middle rope, hang-
ing well out over Dr. Bohrsman and Benjamin Fuller
and being held there by Bill’s left elbow; the
Edwards right was busy cuffing the Yankee lug.
Then Edwards “let him up,” and they were in the
centre of the ring when a right to the defenceless
point put Edwards down. Up at nine seconds, he
appeared silly and all but helpless, and was banged
down again. Up at six and down again, he was so
obviously done that Maguire slung in the towel.

The dispute between Englishman Harry
Whybrow (9st. 741 b.) and Bert McCarthy (9st.
Ilf lb.) was billed "by the Melbourne Stadium people
as a 20-rounder. As early as the first round philan-
thropists hoarsely offered to lay 10 to 1 against the
chubby-faced little Briton, but there were no takers.
McCarthy, whose sojourn in Maoriland did him a
heap of good, gave a faultless display and stopped
the migrant in the fifth. It would be a kindness
to Henry if some of his relatives induced him to
follow a different profession.
* * * *
“Ringside” : Adelaide Advertiser has been
publishing the reminiscences of Joe Choynski, the
wonderfully game and hard-hitting cruiserweight who
fought Corbett, Fitzsimmons, Goddard, Sharkey,
Jeffries, Ruhlin, Kid McCoy, Jack Johnson and
Peter Maher; in fact, nearly all the famous heavy-
weights of his time. Of Joe Goddard, who twice
knocked him out in four rounds in Australia, Choyn-
ski says:—
“He was one of the greatest natural fighters I ever
saw—not clever, but fast, and prodigiously strong
with a head like a lion. He was almost impervious
to knockout’ punches. I believe Goddard would have
beaten John L. Sullivan then, considering the con-
dition of John L., who was in Australia with ‘Honest
Hearts and Willing Hands,’ and with whom I
returned to America.”
Choynski was confirmed in this impression when
he boxed three rounds with John L. on their return
home: “I felt glad he had not fought in Australia,
for if he had, the championship would have left
America.” Apropos, the esteemed Stokes, recently
Labor Lud Mayor, giving the customary Sydney
Town Hall reception to returned pug. Cook, described
that young man as “the best heavyweight that ever
left Australia.” A tapper like Cook wouldn’t have
lasted two rounds with Goddard or Slavin.
* * * *
“The Eaffer”: A modern version of an
old game was seen at Wauchope (N.S.W.) the other
day, when there was a race between a horse and a
motor-cyclist. The distance was a furlong, and they
both kicked off from a standing start, the prad on
the racecourse aud the cyclist on a road alongside.
The man on the machine won by 30 yards. In the
. days when travelling teams of peds. used to be taken
round the shows and race weeks in north and western
Queensland, a match between a ped. and a horse —
usually a nippy pony —was always a draw. The
usual thing was 100 yards, or a longer distance, out
and back, with a right-about turn round a post. A
fast lad used to the game would nearly always beat
the pony, but sometimes a specially-trained beast,
which could turn on one hind foot like a eamp-
, horse, was struck. In that case, “negotiations” were
usually entered into, and several matches run, with
varying results, till the mugs could (or would) bet
no more.
The Australian swimming championships,
which began at Melbourne City Baths last week,
showed the Japanese visitors, Takaishi and Saito,
superior to the best of the Australians in the
absence of Andrew Charlton. As non-residents, the
visitors cannot hold Australian titles, and in the
instances where they finished first the distinction
went to the man placed second. On the opening
night, Saito drew first blood by winning the 100
yards back-stroke in lmin. 10 4-ssec., 2sec. better
than the previous Australian record. Boost, a
Queenslander, was second and Johansen (Vic.) third ;
Kirkland, the N.S.W. and Australian champion, was
last. Though Takaishi took the 100 yards in 54
2-ssec., Henry (N.S.W.) led him to the second
turn and was beaten by a few yards only, his
time being 56 4-ssee. “Tak’s” figures are 1 2-ssec.
worse than Duke Itahanamoku’s Australian record,
made at Sydney in 1915. Grier (Queensland) was
third, followed by Stedman (Vic.) and Kirkland;
“Brusher” Jones (W.A.), who had beaten Stedman
in his heat, having been disqualified for boring. Jones
made no mistake in the mile championship, held at
The Dive, Box Hill; he -won by 60 or 70 yards in
24min. 14sec., which is excellent time for the
Box'Hill pool, though not a record. Kelly (N.S.W.)
was second and S. Springfield (Queensland) third.
The 440 yards breast-stroke went to Stedman in

“Nakhoda”: The Dive at Box Hill (Vie.) is as
picturesque as its name. It is a huge abandoned quarry,
half full of bright green spring water, and the sheer
sides are all the colors of the rainbow. Interest is
given to the contests by the ever-present possibility
of the variegated humanity packed round the edge
doing an imitation of the Gadarene swine and
slopping over in agitated swarms. One springboard
is 52ft. above the surface, and a swallow dive from
that height is a beautiful thing to see. The human
molecule really does look birdlike and at home
sailing down past 100,000 years or so of geological
history and entering the water with a minimum
of fuss. Incidentally, the moisture isn’t as buoyant
as it looks, and as there is a straight stretch of
110 yards with only a rope to kick off from, the
pool hasn’t been productive of startling records.
• •••••
“F.S.”: There is a good deal that is new in
Takaishi’s fishlike leg dance, which pushes his
body above the surface without any particular assist-
ance from his almost leisurely arms. Saito’s back-
stroke also looks novel. He swings his arms over,
palms upward and close to his body, in a way which
suggests double joints about the shoulders, and
which gives him several inches more than the normal
reach, despite his short stature. Both visitors in
starting bound high into the air and, striking the
water several feet ahead of their opponents, dive
rather deeply. Being lightweights, they soon lose
way, but seem to profit on the whole by the
transaction.

The Australian lawn-tennis champion-
ships began with a splash in Melbourne on
Saturday, when Norman Brookes declared the
new stand at the Koovong courts well and
truly open. The old ’un turned out in an
exhibition doubles with Gerald Patterson against
Hawkes and O’Hara Wood. Though showing flashes
of the genius that was once his, his years found the
ex-champion out, and the opposition won three
straight sets. There was a capita] match in the
singles between the South Aus. colt D. P. Turnbull
and L. J. Aslangul, Turnbull running the well-
accredited Frenchman to five sets. And E. T. Noske
took a set from Patterson and was leading a—3 in
the fourth set; then Patterson woke up art captured
set (8 —6) and rubber.
* * * *
“Bootle” : Arthur Richardson is the latest
Australian cricketer to consider a proposition from
one of the North of England League clubs. So far
the South Aus. public has not permitted itself to
be torn with anguish, as were the Victorians in
Ponsford’s case, and no newspaper has yet suggested
making Arthur an offer “compatible With his
dignity” to stay behind and save Australia, as did
a Vic. journal touching the young man who
plays for the Cabbage Garden—when it suits
him. The cold truth is that Australian
cricket can well spare both Ponsford and Richardson.
Let the North Country Leagues have their will of
the batsmen. But should a great bowler arise, and
an attempt be made to nobble him, this country
will look to the Federal Government to refuse him
a passport.
“Cash Amateur” : English papers have been
commenting on the action of the N.S.W.C.A. in
raising the daily payments to Sheffield Shield
cricketers. Sporting Life says that “present con-
ditions in Australia are more likely to induce a
man to remain a ‘paid amateur’ than to become
openly and honestly a professional, which is a
serious thing.” On this Sydney Herald comments
that Australians will not consider payment a serious
thing for the game. More’s the pity, then. The
recent unpleasant yelp about the £250 bonus where
£3OO and more was expected, the threats of “strike,”
the absence of several players from representative
teams, and the action taken by the V.C.A. in the
case of Ponsford and Ryder, who have been dis-
qualified from playing pennant matches for refusing
to help their State to regain the Sheffield Shield, all
indicate that payment, under present conditions of
pseudo-amateurism, is a serious thing for the game.
* * * *
“J.H.” (Bond.) : One of the new umpires
appointed by the M.C.C. for first-class matches next
season is Joe Hardstaff, the little Notts batsman
who was very successful with A. O. Jones’s team in
Australia 19 years ago. Joe was known to the
barrackers as “Hotstuff.” He had an attractive
style, but lacked the staying power of the Gunn
brothers, George and Jack.
THE CROWNING SORROW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
•‘Worst hated of all ways of losing money on a
racecourse is the backing of a dead ’un. Sydney
de(ily.
You might conjecture that he'd mixed
A dozen diff’rent potions,
His honest mug is so transfixed
By varying emotions.
The racecourse girl who, richly clad,
Hears rip behind her chiffon
Or silk, can hardly feel as sad
Or look as martyred and as mad
As he who’s backed a stiff ’un.
Some homing punters strike your view
As if they’d had them handed
AVhat Boney copped at Waterloo
Or Louis at Sedan did.
But when one looks as if he’d struck
A deadlier Armageddon,
Don't ask him if by cruel luck
His fancy finished in the ruck—
’Tis odds he backed a dead ’un.
Is rage depicted on his map
And woe for vanished pelf, too,
The urge to slay some other chap
And soundly kick himself, too?
They show, although he had it straight
What tipsters call the “griffun,”
A blinking' moral at the weight,
A frozen cert—they show, too late
He; found he’d backed a stiff ’un.
’Tis hard to do your boodle in
And risk some worse disaster
On blooming nags that fail to win
’Cause other prads are faster.
But when is ever life so gray
And grim, or skies so leaden,
As when you take your homeward way
Discerning in yourself a jay,
A mug who backed a dead ’un?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Intelligent anticipation is the keynote of moden
journalism.” —Lord Northcliffe.
Young Pressman, pause and give an ear;
If you'd a satisfactory wad earn
To purchase scran and boots and beer
Remember to be ultra-modern.
Pursuit of truth is out of date,
A long-forgot hallucination;
Upon this only concentrate—
Intelligent anticipation.
The truly to-the-minute scribe
Is dubious as to Fact as Pilate;
He hears unmoved the subtle tribe
Of furtive politicians dilate
On this or that; then he unlocks
The treasure-chest of revelation,
His key to that Pandora’s box—
Intelligent anticipation.
Into your daily task infuse
The art your forerunners were short in.
They hunted hopelessly for “clues,”
And though, occasion’ly, they brought in
A stick or two of “story,” they
Had saved themselves much perspiration
Had they attempted to essay
Intelligent anticipation.
It sometimes happens that the mark
Is missed, through some unconscious bias,
And then each loud, ebullient nark
Roars raucously of Ananias,
While rival journals yelp with joy.
Pray don’t give way to irritation;
On something fresh at once employ
Intelligent anticipation.
But, if the chance-shot arrow flies
To fluke a bull’s-eye, then what glory I
With ululations rend the skies,
With fat, black cross-heads tell the story!
No urger in the land employed
In racing ratiocination
Shall warmer greet, all over-joyed,
Intelligent anticipation.

John B. Cooper, an old Melbourne Inky
Way man, lias written histories of Prahran,
Brighton and St. Kilda for their respective
councils. The St. Kilda record will be pub-
lished in time for the Duke to be pi-esented
with a copy on a red velvet cushion garnished
with heavy silk tassels.
The A.J.A. Federal Council will begin its
annual conference at Perth on March 25.
Preparations will be made for the cmployers-
employees’ tribunal in November, when, if
both sides are willing, the present award
can be rebuilt. The alternative is to wait
for a year, and let the Arbitration Court
decide. Rates have been raised since Isaacs,
J., gave an award nearly 10 years ago, but
conditions are pretty much the same.
It was his exposure of Louis de Rouge-
mont’s yarns about his experiences in north-
ern Australia that lifted Martin Donohoe
into a prominence which caused the London
Daily Chronicle to make him its corres-
pondent in the Boer War. Donohoe, a Gal-
way native, who had finished his schooling
in Paris, , arrived in Sidney at the age of
23 to start his press career on the French
paper Courier Australien, and passed
thence to the Evening News. His associa-
tion with the Daily Chronicle lasted from
1899 to his death —he represented that paper
in almost every part of the world where
war-drums sounded, except for a time during
the Great War when he was attached to the
British Intelligence Corps. Donohoe was no
passenger either ; he got right into the military
movements, and, like Winston Churchill, was
captured by the Boers, not being released
till Pretoria fell. Before he died, at the
age of 57, he was Paris correspondent of
his journal. lie married Madge Tilley, a
Sydney girl.
W. 11. Simmonds, editor of the Hobart
Mercury, has finished half a century on the
Inky Way. Born in 1860, he was on the
Birmingham Post at 16; later became assis-
tant editor of the Yorkshire Tost, chief sub.
of the Edinburgh Evening News, assistant
editor of the Cape Argus and news editor
of the Pall Mall Gazette (London). In
1909 he was assistant editor of the Calcutta
Statesman in 1911 he went to Maoriland.
and a little later was editor of the Bris-
bane Daily Mail. Then he crossed to Tas-
mania to edit the Mercury, and has done it
ever since. He has two sons in journalism,
one in Melbourne and one in London.
Probably his numerous shifts have been
mostly due to the fact that he isn’t an accom-
modating person, and if he doesn’t like his
company will promptly get out of it. He.
was the Tasmanian in a party of news-
paper proprietors and editors who went to
France during the war as guests of the
British Government. For relaxation their
host’s representative took them one night
to a Paris music-hall. Part of the show was
pretty raw, but all stood it easily—except
Simmonds. He turned to his host, said
“Excuse me !” and left.
“A.H.A.” : A Sydney paper says ( that the
pressmen on the Renown were “sent to
Coventry” by the ward-room, and, as one
of the inhabitants of the “dove-cot” through-
out the Australian tour of the Prince, I say
it is not true. I gathered that Keith Mur-
doch, whose job I took over at Melbourne,
was not too happy on the voyage out; but
there was nothing beyond that. Of the others
B. Iv. Long, ‘ that casual English good-fellow,
failed in the ward-room through refusing to
make a speech-—any sort of speech would
have done in that cheery crowd. Everard
Cotes did not fit in. Marsden did, and on
the third day he remarked to me: They ve.
got you. You’re all right.” The official cine-
matographer was at first put among the
clerks; but he was such a delightful, rough-
diamond that he was made an honorary
member of the mess. No snobbery there.
The main thing was not to talk at break-
fast. At the end of the tour I was invited
by 11.R.H., the captain and the president ot
the mess to go, as a passenger, to England.
I had to turn the offer down owing to pri-
vate reasons; that it should have been made
didn’t sound much like Coventry.

The deplorable decadence of Australian
theatre manners was felt at Sydney Royal
on Saturday when the elegant “lolanthe”
overture was drowned in the flood of sound
from seatholders still finding their places
and the chattering of these people and of
those already arrived. Time was when the
late-comer in an Australian theatre slunk
to his seat in a humble and apologetic spirit,
not because of any reproach from the man-
agement, but because of the plainly-shown
and just hostility of the audience; but gradu-
ally the bad manners of Britain’s “best
people,” to meet whose evil habits the “cur-
tain raiser” had to be used, have taken pos-
session.

The remarkable mixture of fairy nonsense
and politics out of which Gilbert pumped
cascades of whimsical satire, whilst Sullivan
weaved a tracing of delicate music, was
brightly introduced by a group of high-heeled
fairies not yet modern enough to wear bobbed
or shingled hair; and from then on the only
interruptions to the hilarity of the proceed-
ings were caused by the insistence of the
audience upon encores, for the most part
given too readily. This was in spite of han-
dicaps. One remembers how the massive
Celia Ghiloni, as the Fairy Queen, started
the show on its convulsions of laughter by
confiding how she swung on a cobweb, dived
in a dewdrop, nestled in a walnut-shell and
did not object to stoutness —in moderation.
Winifred Williamson lacked the tonnage to
give those points their full humorous effect,
“COBRA,” AT SYDNEY CRITERION.
Harry Daniell as Jack Race, and Michael
Hogan as Tony Doming.
but she sang her way into the favor of the
audience, and had gone far towards work-
ing off her handicap before the end came.
Strella Wilson could not find a place in the
cast, but Patti Russell, though overpoweredi
by some of the music, did well as Phyllis,
and Bffie Armstrong moderately as lolanthe,
although sorrow for her immersion in the
frogpond clung to her too long. Charles
Walenn was the highly-susceptible Chancel-
lor whose decrepit legs occasionally became
very lively; his start was inauspicious, but
he wiped out his handicap too. Stiff especi-
ally at first as Streplion, Lance Fairfax made
a substantial and satisfying lover who is
mortal from the waist down ; Bernard Man-
ning, who, as Lord Mountararat, sang “When
Britain Really Ruled the Waves,” might
well be firmer with his audience than he was
when he consented to repeat the tail-end
verse so often. But he was good. James
Hay (Lord Tolloller) was occasionally indis-
tinct ; John Ralston made an imposing Pri-
vate Willis, and sang the recitative about
the political faiths of new-born infants with
effect, although somewhat short of humor.
There was nothing extraordinary about the
minor parts; but the chorus work was, on
the whole, magnificent.
The unreal but interesting “White Cargo”
was delivered for a short revival at Sydney
Palace on Saturday. Wallis Clark, as the
derelict doctor, is as convincing a drunk as
ever, and earned the most appreciation ; but
all the characters move as if they really lived
where it is impossible to keep either shirts
or morals clean; and Helen Stransky is as
nearly-nude as ever. The revival is to run
for three weeks only.
sis s;s sj:
The last weeks of “Rose Marie” are now
proclaimed, but not yet in an imperative
way; it is still not necessary to frighten
peoiple into Her Majesty’s. At the Criterion
Judith Anderson remains as the main reason
for ‘Cobra.” “Aladdin” is this week dis-
appearing from the Grand Opera House—
Nellie Bramley returns there on February
5 with “Fair and Warmer.” “Jack and the
Beanstalk” will prolong the panto, season
at the St. James. The new Empire Theatre
is giving an outward appearance of having
everything in readiness for the opening with
Sunny” on February 28. Instead of the
Repertory season opening at the Palace on
Saturday fortnight (February 12), the day
after the “White Cargo” season ends, Ken-
neth Duffield’s “Healo” will make an appear-
ance. The partnership of Duffield with
Ilowett Worster and Kitty Reidy, which
opened at the New Palace in Melbourne 18
months ago, burst through internal combus-
tion; but Harry Hall (who has been Hugh
Wards trusted producer) is responsible for
the present production, which includes
Arthur Stigant as comedian and William
Prettyman as leading man. If Duffield’s
music lives up to the “Snap” quality, the
South Australian’s show should be worth
seeing. Dion Titheradge provides lyrics, dia-
logue and scenes.

The blare of instruments of brass broke
out in two spots in Sydney on Saturday—
in the Australian Hall during the afternoon,
when the solo instrumentalists wrestled for
their points in the 24th Inter-State Band
Contest, and at the Sports Ground at night,
when the bands, which include three from
Queensland (the only ones from outside N.
S. Wales), struggled in mass formation for
the prizes. The bands of the Sydney and
coal-mining districts—where everybody blows
brass from the earliest age—were well repre-
sented. The walls of the Victoria Barracks,
evidently more solid than those of Jericho,
continue to merely shake with the sound of
massed instruments during the week. An
early success was struck by the Bondi Beach
Band, which beat by five points in the
marching display Toowoomba City, though
the latter was finely turned out.

Worse comedians have been seen on the
boards of Fullers (Sydney) than some of
the monkeys in the performing troupe which
has this week invaded that showhouse. The
monkey is not, as a rule, a merry animal, but
the serious efforts of this well-trained assort-
ment of man’s distant cousins provide con-
siderable amusement, especially for the
youngsters. The Zig-Zag Revue Co. bring
home the mutton with “Mary’s Lamb,” Lamb
being a philandering artist whose wife uses
the whip rather heavily until bowled out in
an indiscretion of her own.

The search for the week’s picture:—
You need not go to see it twice,
This picture mis-named “Paradise”
For, if you take this fan.’s advice,
No aching void it fills.
The hero has his money blewed,
And ’planes into the plot intrude,
And dusky maidens semi-nude;
And (later on) some thrills.
Then when the plot has fallen dead
The actors in a yacht are led
To go on treasure-hunts instead
Of other painful ills.
They find an island rather nice—
Its name, you’ve guessed, is “Paradise”-
And there are fights that quite suffice
For Mr. Milton Sills.
But on the island there’s a blot;
One Noah Beery’s on the spot;
And also there’s a scrumptious lot
Of maids who wear no frills;
And all the rest is stoush and bite
And heavy punch and hefty right
That win much cheap applause each night—
A star of stoush is Sills 1
Buster battling makes a rattling stousliing picture-
show.
Keaton’s taken up and shaken with a knock-out blow.
The attraction is the action, prize-rings and the
game;
But the fighting is exciting—not one round is tame!
Once this gory, brutal story was a theatre show.
Make no' bloomer: stoush and humor make a picture
go!
Both pictures are at Hoyt’s and the Strand,
in Sydney.

If the management of the Sydney Tivoli
wants to do itself a good turn it might
remember that comedians are the plums of
the pudding, and a neglect of the comic side
may make the best aggregation of
turns dull. On Monday last Moore
and Shy, although on the programme,
missed their shot, and apparently there
was not a real comedy turn available to make
up the weight. The Haney dancers —four
men and a girl—are a slick combination, and
the Longfields, two men and an amazingly
muscular girl, provide another good new
turn; but M’lle Jeanne’s performing cats and
rats, although they give some juvenile

amusement, show no extraordinary tricks,
Clement May, with his literary impersona-
tions, the Flying Winskills, and Leopoldi, a
quick-change artist who is a master of make-
up, are all vaudeville gems which would
glitter much better if there was more comic
relief in the show.

On Saturday the congregation at Mel-
bourne King’s wall see “The Last of Mrs.
Cheney”—also the first of her. On the same
night “The Ghost Train,” stated to be staffed
by stars and freighted with thrills and
laughter, will glide into the Athenaeum. “The
Cousin from Nowhere” will persist melodi-
ously at His Majesty’s for yet a few more
nights; “The Hottentot” is still in full
career at the Palace, and at the Royal Ada
Reeve is still on “Pins and Needles.” At
the Princess “Puss in Boots” is getting some
possibly unwelcome publicity on the score
of the alleged cruelty behind its animal acts.
Some nature-lovers have gone so far as to
form tentatively a society pledged to quit
its seat and leave the auditorium when the
four-footed performers take the boards.

The best showman seen at Melbourne
Tivoli for a long time is Don Alfonso
Zelaya, the stout Nicaraguan who makes a
laughable business out of converting people
from jazz to the classics. To hear him play
a Chopin funeral march and then syncopate
it is to be furiously converted. Little Tich
continues to find humor in the mal-adjust-
ment of his trousers, and the Lee sistren,
hefty wenches, are clever gymnasts who help
to divert attention from 3LO’s Perfect Girl.

reason for worrying much about what comes
before as long as George Wallace follows
after. This week the comedian is providing
“Happy Moments” to fair audiences.
*l* '!' v $
At Melbourne Majestic this week John
Harron and Dorothy Devore are footing “The
Gilded Highway,” a conventional if congested
thoroughfare which leads from sordidness to
sudden affluence, then takes a sharp turn
into disillusionment before arriving at its
proper destination of happy though impover-
ished hearts. It is followed by English actor
Matheson Lang as “The Qualified Adven-
turer” —a fine performance. The American
fleet was mobilised for “The Blue Eagle,” an
affair of bootleggers, toughs and gobs at
Hoyt’s, whose second main distraction is
“Battling Butler,” a diverting translation to
the screen of the musical comedy, which
tends to. confirm this Page’s suspicions that
the music of that piece never really mattered
very much.
Out-o’-doors Art:—
That most largely-attended art show, the exhibi-
tion of posters on Mr. Clapp’s railway platform,
presents this year some improvement over previous
uisplays, though the change isn’t revolutionary. The
greater frequency of Australian motives is' to be
commended, though here also there is plenty of room
for expansion. The Pelaco Co. leads in sturdy
adherence to local themes. The large portrait of an
aboriginal in a beautifully-ironed shirt leading a
spirited racehorse is convincing, and should have a
wide appeal. Bryant and May’s swaggie, smiling
confidently while he strikes his last match, cannot be
too highly praised for both subject and treatment;
the artist hides himself behind the initials “5.C.8.,”
although in England men like Brangwyn have not
scrupled to use the hoardings. The Wertheim Aus-
tralian Pianos’ study of a magpie and kookaburra
sitting vocal on a fence is a well-meant and imagina-
tive effort, but the touch of fantasy is lost in the
faulty drawing. The Dandy Starch map of this conti-
nent, planted without regard to soil and climate from
one end to the other with corn, invites the same
criticism.
Among the crudities that should never have passed
the selection committee are many emanating from
Government departments, which, true to their repu-
tation for wasting the public’s money, here throw
it away on ineffective advts. Tasmania’s contribution
is the portrait of a decayed old man in a decrepit
bowler whose features are supposed to represent tin-
various scenic wonders of the Speck. Such a feeble
effort is not calculated to attract tourists across
Bass Strait. Among the still-lifes may be mentioned
a study of fruit by the Rose] la Proprietary, which
lacks modelling and depth. There is. 'however,
genuine feeling in Bennett and Woolcock’s sausages
and hams.
The Railway Department’s own panel is the best
single exhibit and shows a pleasing modern trend.
The holiday-maker is urged to buy a ticket to see
the sea because, presumably, the sea is completely
obscured by flappers’ legs; he is invited to travel to
the mountains because the landscape there is very
much the same. Except for Mr. Clapp’s tentative
efforts, however, the nude is but poorly represented.
A study submitted by the makers of" Burson hose
reveals a portion of a lady very handsomely propor-
tioned, if unusually tall; but even this has incurred
censure in some quarters.
On the whole, the show is decidedly encouraging.
Last year over 150 million people are said to have
attended. When Australian manufacturers realise
that artists like George Lambert, W. B. Mclnnes and
Norman Lindsay are not a bit too good to be hung
in such a gallery, the art education of the nation
will have definitely begun.
‘Lud”: George Grossmith, the English
comedian and manager, has always been asso-
ciated with the musical-comedy stage. But,
like all comedians, he wanted to show the.
public what he could do in “straight”
comedy, and chose the highly-important role
of the gay Lord Quex. Being his own boss,
nobody, not even the author, could stop him
The result was painful, and G.G. hurried
back to song-an’-dance. Recently at tin
London Gallery First-Nighters’ Club an
address, “Is Pantomime Dead?” was deliv
ered. One member claimed that the best
pantomime he had ever seen was Gros-
smith’s Quex. At that performance Edgar
Wallace, the novelist-playwright, remarked:
“This will postpone Grossmith’s knighthood
for 10 years.”

The exceptional tonal beauty of the Wurlitzer is a constant source of pleasure
to all lovers of good music, and enthusiasm increases as, year after year, the
glorious Wurlitzer tone retains its bell-like clarity and mellowness. No
player-piano offers such excellence of workmanship, or such lasting mechanical
precision—while Wurlitzer’s simplicity of operation and ability to play expres-
sively by hand or by roll, are unsurpassed.
Any Wurlitzer dealer will willingly explain the metal action which is an exclusive feature of
the Wurlitzer Player Piano.

‘‘Caul Roy”: Nellie Stewart opens in
"Sweet Nell” at Melbourne Itoyal on Febru-
ary 10, 41 years after she house-warmed
the Princess as Yum Yum in “The Mikado.”
Any producer would be proud to assist in
the enterprise, but Nellie has drawn Norman
Campbell from the Inky Way to do it..
Campbell produced for and acted with her in
the old days. In addition he will play Lord
Jeffreys, and his wife will take a part.
“Flaming Y.”: Warde Morgan, who was a
principal of the Marie Burke co. when, on
the way to Brisbane, it got mixed up in the
Aberdeen smash, was expected to be, at
best, a permanent cripple. But now he goes
about in his car—he is his own driver—
is studying the score of “Madame Pompa-
dor,” and optimistically looks forward to
appearing in it before the year is out.
E. J. Carroll writes from Paris:—
“Bisley” says (B. 4/11/’26) that I am “reported
to have said that Australia was backward in film-
producing merely because ‘we have no writers of
fiction’ ”; and he proceeds to name a few writers,
;ind mentions one or two Australian photoplays, in-
cluding “The Sentimental Bloke.” I have never
said or thought anything so disparaging to Australian
authors or writers. I exploited very successfully my
intimate friend C. J. Dennis’s film “The Senti-
mental Bloke” throughout Australia and Britain;
I financed Raymond Longford in the making of “The
Moods of Ginger Mick”; also Steele Rudd’s “On
Our Selection” and “Our New .Selection,” Harrison
Owen’s “The Blue Mountain Mystery,” and Snowy
Baker’s “The Man from Kangaroo,” “Lightning
Ridge,” etc. I presented and produced, assisted
by those kindly Australians Bert Bailey and Jules
Grant, Dennis’s stage version of “The Bloke,”
and, more recently, Tal Ordell’s “Kangaroo Plat” at
my Athenaeum Theatre; also, I spent much time,
effort and money in America in the endeavor to
secure recognition there for Australian talent.
Actions speak louder than words!
“Omega”: There is one good reason for
believing that Gladys Moncrieff would have
discovered herself (P>. 30/12/’26). When a
kid she used to sing for the entertainment of
the bar frequenters of a hotel in Mossman
(N.Q.), and, as a kid will, amused herself
by scribbling her name on the walls. When
the . publican remonstrated with her, she
replied: “You growl at me now, but some
day you’ll be pleased to point it out to
your customers.” One of the childish signa-
tures has been preserved.
“A.G.M.” (Bond.) : Those who remember
Courtice Pounds in the Williamson produc-
tions of Gilbert and Sullivan long ago would
be surprised at the manner in which he can
still sing his way through a musical perform-
ance. The voice seemed none too robust in
those halcyon, days of the Australian stage;
yet to-day it is quite reliable and shows con-
siderable beauty of tone owing to the skill
with which he manipulates it. “Lilac Time”
is back again in London ; and at the Chelsea
Palace this week Pounds gave an altogether
admirable interpretation of the shy and lov-
able Schubert, the part which he created and
which he is now singing, he says, for the last
time. The continued vitality of “Lilac Time”
is proving a little goldmine to that gifted
Australian,. George H. Clutsam, whose work
in the musical arrangement of the play has
had much to do with its success.
“Butt Innitt”: “There were no ‘Henry
VIII.’ properties or costumes in this coun-
try,” says “De Oriel,” apologising for Allan
Wilkie’s unnecessary purchasing in London.
Yet Mrs. Wilkie remained in Australia see-
ing to the making of wardrobe for all the
Shakspearean plays; and “Henry VIII.”
clobber could have been made here as well
as the “As You Like It” glad rags of the
same period. Nellie Stewart did “When
Knighthood was in Flower” here a few
years ago, a Henry VIII. play, with the
bloated polygamist in the cast; and she never
went out of Australia for even a halberd.
“Mid-Channel”: Why should Bertram
Mackennal’s description of Sydney as
“sordid” (B. 20/l/’27) be regarded as “the
unkmdest cut which any Victorian has ever
made against the N.S.W. capital”? Surely
a city that pays to witness such an unsavory
are degrading exhibition as “White Cargo”
for three months shouldn’t quake at the gibe.
“The Show 7 man”: If “Mid-Channel” (B.
20/l/’27) had considered his dates for a
moment he would have remembered that
Brough’s “Second Mrs. Tanqueray” “staged
25 years ago” wasn’t anything like the first
production; it was a revival in the “fare-
well” season of the Broughs in July-August,
1902. “When We Were Twenty-one” opened
the season ; and following that Sydney had
its first view of “Iris,” which could run
only for a week, although Brough made an
outstanding success in the part that subse-
quently Oscar Asclie liked so much. The
rest were revivals ; and in the “Tanqueray”
revival Brough was Tanqueray and Leslie
Victor, as Cayley Drummle, made a particu-
larly good hit. Brenda Gibson was the
ingenue; Cecil Ward the lover whose pre-
vious intrigue with her stepmother brings
about the tragedy.
“Hamfat”: “Midchannel” (B. 20/l/’27)
is wrong in questioning the “Sundry Shows”
statement that Leslie Victor played Cayley
Drummle in 1902 ; but his error wakes in-
terest in that “farewell” season of the
Broughs, which was only made possible by
the backing of soli-
citor Reggie Allen
—t he Allens
subsequently b e-
came big share-
holders in the Wil-
liamson firm. It
was a poor time
for theatricals,
anyway, and the
high-class Brough
show felt it most;
the proposal was
even made that the
Broughs should re-
ceive a Common-
wealth subsidy to
keep them going,
just as a similar
proposal has been
made regarding
Allan Wilkie. In-
cidentally, a hard-
working member of
the co. of those
days was Percy
Walshe, a fi rs t-
class actor, who,
amongst other
parts, did excel-
lently as Coke in
“The Liars.” Tra-
gedy came to him
in chroat trouble
which left him
with an impedi-
ment in his speech;
and he now makes
a living stage-
managing amateurs
and so on. The
failure of a much-
acclaimed amateur
to reach profes-
sional status was
another incident of
the season. Stuart
Clyde was the amateur; hut put on in
When We Were Twenty-one” he was such
a gloomy failure that he faded right out of
the picture.
“Rob P.”: I approached Sydney and Mel-
bourne publishers with the hopes of selling
a few jazz compositions. They were unani-
mous in declaring. Australian compositions
profitless, but admitted that an extra-catchy
jazz number would find favor. The best
offer for accepted songs was £5 for the copy-
right and 2d. per copy royalty on general
sales. The vendor was required to provide
the cover design in black and white, and
the script had to be written on special
paper suitable for reproduction. The pro-
bable return from the copyright of an
accepted song would be about two guineas,
with royalties according to numbers sold.
My friend and I earn £1 for the first three
hours and 12s. 6d. an hour overtime for
playing imported jazz songs. Would we be
justified, in wasting our time composing and
attempting to sell our own effusions?
“Alwyn”: Bernard Manning, the G. and
S. bass, was personally coached by D’Oyly
Carte for many of his roles. When a youth he
visited this country, and went farming, and
he will come back to it later on. He was
one of Dr. Sampson’s tenor choristers at the
Brisbane Cathedral; yet after six months
under Landon Ronald at the London Guild-
hall of Music he won their bass prize.
“R.K.D.N.” : Should the Williamson direc-
tors decide to show Judith Anderson in her
second Broadway success, “The Dove,” the
company now supporting her in “Cobra”
will have to be augmented. There are 17
women in a cast of over 30 people in the
piece, which was concocted by Willard Mack,
whose “Kick In” was staged here a few
years ago.
“Ancient Prompter”: Hugh McCrae’s
sketch of the two actors (B. 13/l/’27)
seems to have a local application. The fat
mummer who, on the advice of his doctor,
“walks after his meals,” is obviously im-
ported. The cadaverous bloke, who “chases
after them,” is the native-born artist —an
excellent likeness. Apropos I went into a
cheap George-street restaurant the other day
to snatch a furtive feed. Sitting at one of
the tables was my old friend Horace Bates,
the dinkum little comedian whose name has
long been missing from the bills. I expressed
my surprise to find the delicate, refined,
weak-stomaclied Horace wolfing a plate of
roast pork. “Yes, old boy, pork and, stuf-
fing,” lie grinned. “I came here expressly
for it. It takes eight hours to digest!”
“Caul Boy”: An interesting feature of
Melba’s absolutely final farewell season in
Australia will be the positively ultimate
resurrection of veteran-flautist John Lem-
mone as director. It is 43 years since the
two tootled and sang together in the Mel-
bourne Town Hall, and they have been asso-
ciated most of the time since. The tour will
begin at Melbourne Auditorium on March
2, and may include a song or two at the
Canberra opening. The date of the diva’s
next final farewell hasn’t yet been announced.
“T. 0.1.”: One of the most remarkable
amateur dramatic performances ever given
in Australia was that by members of
HE'D SEEN TO THAT.
MANAGER: “Is this play of yours clean?”
AUTORr: “Glean! I should say so. Why, there's a bathroom scens
in the first act.”
the Victorian Parliament in aid of a Shaks-
peare statue fund. The play was “The Mer-
chant of Venice,” the Shylock being Mark
Last King, who left the stage as Morton
King to become a general merchant. Vincent
Pyke, M.L.A., Minister for Customs, was
the Merchant; George Coppin, then an
M.L.C., was Launcelot Gobbo ; and Tom Car-
penter, with a rich Cornish brogue, was Old
Gobbo. The performance took place at the
old Theatre Royal, Bourke-street.
“Spare Moron”: Little Willie, ex-Crown
Prince of Germany, has, according to a cable,
signed a contract with an American movie
co. to act in. a film. The picture is to be
taken at Wieringen, in Holland, where he
spent the early days of his retreat from
Germany. The subject of the picture is not
mentioned. Young Bill should do well. He
has been photographed and filmed since baby-
hood. It may yet come to a long contract
at Hollywood itself, where he should be
thoroughly in his element.
“Topee”: Reference to Tom W. Robert-
son’s “Caste” (B. 13/l/’27) recalls the tre-
mendous vogue this, with “Ours,” “School”
and “M.P.,” had in England in the ’sixties
and ’seventies. As a little boy I used to
play with his children, Tom and Madge
(afterwards Mrs. Kendal), at the Camden
Town home, and shared the scoldings for
disturbing father at his compositions. “Ours”
was produced at the Sydney Royal, say, 45
years ago. About the same time an amateur
co. gave “Caste,” Cedes, the bibulous
father being excellently played by the late
Lt.-Col. A. 11. P. Savage, then adjutant of
the N.S.W. Permanent Artillery. George
Honey was the original and best Ecdes
on the English stage, and, in my opinion,
the amateur’s performance was little inferior.
“r laming Youth” : Another heart-twisting
vaudeville ballad of the old days was “The
Prisoner’s Return.” It described how a
young man, led away by spendthrift habits,
got himself in “the cooler” and came out
to provide sob-stuff for the multitude:—
E was by gay life deluded ;
’E got six munce for Vs caper;
Air ’is mother died ’eart-brokeu
When she read it in the paper.
Yus ! ’ls mother died ’eart-broken
When she read it in the paper!
But even that is not much worse than the
words that go to that not-too-bad melody,
“The Prisoner’s Song.”
“Ibsenshaw”: Dramatists such as Henry
Arthur Jones and Arthur Wing Pinero can't
get a show in London these days. The
younger generation—Noel Coward, Ben
Travers, Frederick Lonsdale, et hoc —have
the entree to the best West-End theatres,
but the giants of other days are denied admit-
tance. Jones has several new pieces ready
and Pinero at least one, finished a year ago.*
He told an interviewer recently that he is
waiting “till an uncommercial manager
comes along.” Yet the famous old Pinero
pieces are mightily successful when revived.
“Curtain Raiser” : The Wowsery Islanders,
strange to say, accepted “White Cargo” with
so little comment that the publicity man
charged with the business of working up the
necessary moral indignation was at his wits’
end. Finally he invited a famous ecclesias-
tic, noted for the burning lava of his elo-
quence, to attend. Next day the agent called
for an opinion. “Splendid, splendid!” said
the parson. “Beautiful atmosphere, excellent
teaching! And the unpleasant facts of life
—how delicately stated!” The agent went
out and drowned liis head in beer.
“L.C.M.” : Here’s another instance of the
influence of “the pitchers.” Four Bill
Harts, of 10 or thereabouts, left their homes
in Banksia —nearly 300 miles away—to
make a pilgrimage to the place where the
N.S.W. railway stages its finest smashes.
The line from Murrurundi to Aberdeen has
earned the name of “the red sector” during
the past few months. Probably the heroes
secretly hoped to feature as rescuers in
another and gorier smash. By dint of chang-
ing trains judiciously they made the long
trip cheaply, perhaps for nothing; but at
Murrurundi the desperadoes were captured by
the police ; and the late train brought four
anxious fathers, who will in the future
carefully regulate their small sons’ allow-
ance for movies.
“Coot”: The first Melbourne theatre to be
lit by gas was the Royal. When John Black
built it, in 1855, the city had up gas, so he
had to manufacture a supply himself. Papers
of the day reported that the new theatre was
“brilliantly illuminated, contrasting finely
with the lugubrious dulness of the Olympic,”
better known as the “Iron Pot.”
“Autopsy”: It appears to be the Jew more
than the Gentile who becomes “the Caruso
of the Keyboard.” Of the piano virtuosi who
have visited Australia, Ilambourg, Paderew-
ski, Carreno, Bauer, Moiseiwitseh, Muncz,
Levitski and Spivakovsky might claim
descent from Jubal; as against Borwick,
Grainger and Backliaus, Christians. Even
among those “poets of the pianoforte,” whose
triumphant tours did not include the Anti-
podes, those of Jewish origin, including
Friedmann, Rubinstein, Joseff'y, Rosenthal,
Paclimann, Godowsky, Hofmann and Rach-
maninoff have a big majority over such
others as Von Bulow, D’Albert and Liszt.
Even though the pedigree of the pianoforte,
by Harpsichord out of Clavichord, cannot
be traced much beyond the dulcimer, it ap-
pears that early music centred round the
synagogue, and it is not surprising that in
the widespread progeny of Jubal there
should be many music-makers.
“Hamfat”: The stage has been strewn
with tragedies such as that of Peter Haddon
in London. He had to play a comedy part
whilst full of anxiety about his sick wife,
and came off to be told of her death. She
was Rosaline Courtneidge, a daughter of the
notable Robert. Tragedy smote more unex-
pectedly the vaudeville comedian who fin-
ished a comic song about the death of his
wife with the refrain : “She’s at rest, and so
am I!” to receive a telegram announcing the
death of his own wife. He had not even
known she was ill. I recollect the incident
of an actress playing “comedy old woman”
in M.L., whilst telegrams came continually
from Sydney informing her of the condition
of her only child, who was critically ill
Only the reassuring telegrams, secretly
opened and resealed, were handed to the
mother. The one stating that the child was
dead was held back until after curtain-fall.
Every laugh the actress raised after the
final telegram made me feel a brute. Yet.
taking all the circumstances into account, I
suppose we did the right thing.

YOU know your ice-chest is effective only when the box is full of ice and that
depends on the iceman. Even when the box is hill, the efficiency is low, for
it is impossible to maintain a uniform temperature in an ordinary ice-chest.
THE COPELAND IS A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF REFRIGERATION, entirely
independent and self-contained.
THE COPELAND IS ALWAYS COLD—constantly cold like a never melting block of ice, main-
taining that uniformity of temperature, which is absolutely essential for the correct preservation of foods-
THE COPELAND GUARDS YOUR FAMILY’S HEALTH. The Copeland System is
more than an ice-maker. Economically and conveniently it preserves your family’s food, and by
eliminating the menace of imperfectly preserved food-stuffs, it protects your family’s health. The
temperature produced in the Copeland is under 50° F., which is scientifically correct. Bacteria
cannot germinate at this temperature all food is kept perfectly fresh.
THE COPELAND, IN OPERATION, WILL COST BUT ONE-THIRD OF WHAT
YOU NOW PAY FOR ICE. Your ice-chest may seem economical, but the cost of ice is almost
three times as much per week as the operating cost of the Copeland. The cost of operation is
really negligible when you reap the many advantages of the Copeland System in your home.
The Copeland System of Electric Refrigeration is within the reach of every home. It is economical
to operate—will cost about one third of your present weekly ice bill. The low first cost is quickly
repaid by the convenience, the time saved, the food preserved and the undoubted pride of posses-
sion that is the pleasure of every Copeland owner. If necessary, extended terms can be arranged.
Come in as soon as possible and inspect the wide range of Copeland Models at your leisure.

a double source of income and profit by operating BOTH motor finance and the cash-order system!
Do you know that motor finance companies’ dividends run all the way from 22 per cent, to 55 per cent, on
capital? You can verify this for yourself. AND do you know that cash-order companies have paid
dividends up to per cent. AND—let us say it again—Motor and Cash Orders, Limited, are operating
BOTH these profit-producing departments of finance 1
Financial experts all over the Commonwealth have all said the same thing, which means that this Company
is in a position to earn the biggest profits of any finance company yet launched in this country. One well-
known financial writer stated in type recently that “the dividend possibilities of the ordinary shares are
such that there would be nothing astonishing in their rising to a value of from £5 to £lO per share.” While
the issue lasts the shares may be bought at par value—£l.
The British-Australian Underwriters (Amalgamated), Limited, the Brokers of the Company, have the option
of taking up and paying for at par (£l ) 100,000 Ordinary Shares which are being granted to the holders of
the first hundred thousand shares.
The number and character of those who have already applied for shares is an unanswerable tribute to the
intensely profitable nature and absolute soundness of the Company’s shares.
This is by far the most attractive opportunity to invest in the shares and participate in the profits of the only
finance organisation in Australia combining two of the most profitable undertakings known in this country.

OBJECTS:
The objects of the Company, inter alia, are: —
To acquire as a going concern the very old-established business of the Vendors, known as Gehrig
and Co., Wine and Spirit Merchants, together with certain assets, detailed in the printed prospectus,
and to carry on this business on modern lines.
To acquire additional wine saloons, to finance hotels and wineshops, and to establish agencies in
every State. The wine saloons thus acquired will be brought up to the modem high standard type
so well patronised in Europe, thus meeting the demand of a very large proportion of the public at
present not catered for in Australasia.
To erect a modern winery in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area.
GEHRIG AND COMPANY:
The business of the Vendors is a well-known one, having been first established in Albury in 1850, and
in Sydney in 1876, from which date it has continued in unbroken prosperity.
Gehrig’s Wines are recognised throughout Australia and by the trade as “second to none,” and
they have been awarded the Champion Gold Medal for Sweet Sherries for the past eight years in
succession, this being an unequalled record in Australia.

Dear Sirs, 11th January, 1927.
We have examined the records and essential papers of Messrs. Gehrig and Company, and
have received explanations and information from Messrs. Henry and Charles Gehrig in order to
arrive at the profits earned by their Pitt Street and Oxford Street Wine Saloons for the year 1926,
and, thereof, have compiled the following statement of Profits and Expenditure in connection
herewith. The figures are for the two Saloons. Independent evidence in support of the figures
quoted has been obtained where possible. The stock on hand at each saloon has been eliminated,
as the figures are fairly constant.

NET PROFIT OF THE TWO WINE CAFES £6,135 17 8
Yours faithfully, (Sg.) HOLT AND THOMPSON, Public Accountants.
THE PROVISIONAL DIRECTORS of Gehrig’s Wines, Limited, desire to point out that the
above report should satisfy the Investing Public that Preference shareholders in the new Company
are well protected, as several other Wine Cafes and the wholesale business of the firm are not
included in these figures.
£6135/17/8 on 58,006 £1 Preference Shares equals over 10 per cent.
The Vendors propose opening new Wine Cafes and conducting them on the above lines. The
above report may be inspected at the office of Alfred Rofe and Sons, Solicitors, Rofe Chambers,
O’Connell Street, Sydney.
THE MAIN POINTS FOR INVESTORS:
1 The business is a going concern, with an established trade.
2 The business to be acquired has been in existence for over 75 years.
3 Net profits, free of Income Taxes, are estimated to be £15,500, or approximately 20 per cent,
on the proposed issued Capital.
4 Gehrig’s Wines are recognised throughout Australia as being of the highest quality, the Champion
Gold Medal for Sherry having been awarded for the past eight years in succession—an Australian record.
5 The demand for Australian Wines is growing both in Australia and Abroad.
6 The Provisional Directors intend to enter the Export Trade.
7 The Export Bounty is now fostering our Wine Trade, as shown by the Record Trade Statistics,
thus placing wine exporters in a stronger position than hitherto.
The Directorate is a very strong one, being composed of men expert in their calling, and includ-
ing Messrs. C. F. and H. J. Gehrig of the Vendor Firm, who have had a lifetime’s experience in the
Wine Trade.
9 Shares issued to Vendors in part consideration of sale are ordinary Shares, thus contributing
Shareholders must secure their dividends before the Vendors. This shows the undoubted faith of the
Vendors in the undertaking.

meat with such indigestible phrases as “his nomen-
clatural appendage”?... .Paul Mell: Found only dul-
ness in your inn.... Jack Tar: Its breeziness lifts us
right off our feet:—
Yo, ho! Yo, ho! for the rolling seas
And their never-ending plain,
Where the giant waves like mountains sneeze,
And the gallant vessels skip like fleas,
On the crests of the roaring main.
Oh, who loves not the sailor’s life?
And who’d not gladly go?
In every port he leaves a wife
Who has not time to stir up strife,
Hurrah for the seas, yo, ho!
....De T.: Par value 0n1y.... John S.: The blank

You leave your foiled Lothario wandering home at

clad” when “grey dawn tops the silver-clad hills” is
meant is a handicap... .A.C.C.: Tangled lines spoil
your chance of scoring a bite... .S.J.: “Her Son” is

To the mountains, pleasure bent,
Gone away’s the missus.
Hope to goodness she will stay—
Is this not our holiday?
Come on, girl, and kiss us!

Bulletin matter... .K.McG.: None up; but we

“Society” par padded into a story... .P.K.P.:
Passed on as requested... .R.P.W.: Sent on to
Mirror. .. .M.G.: The tragedy of “A False Mate”
must go in:—
Two quarts of Irish whiskey
Ned’s mate poured down his neck,
And left Ned in his cabin
A snoring, drunken wreck.
He then took Edward’s hatchet
And his Sunday suit of clothes,
And killed poor old Jim Clancy
With three horrid bashing blows.
They brought Ned in as guilty,
For his clothes were soaked in gore;
And they sent him to the gallows—
Poor Ned of old Kilmore.
But his spirit roams the valleys,
For the debt to man it owes
Is to find the wretch who purloined
Poor drunken Edward’s clothes.
....Con D.: You say you’d give her all the world,
but she is still unkind. Evidently gone off her knut...
M.C.C.: The story of how Sammy went to the club

heroines to be “the lady in question”.. .R.F.H.: Can’t
find yard-space for that dog... .N.L.S.: Wung Loo
is not particularly interesting... .T.F.W.: In Abo.

pense of polish. The Bush is beginning to write its
own verse again, and is getting on first-rate....
5.0. L.: You must be a quick love-maker to be able
to mourn a new-dead sweetheart every week.... D.:
The Religious Editor wants the address of the pawn-
broker who lent enough on an old suit to pay the
rent.. .E.ILL.: Sorry, but this paper will hesitate to
recommend the Commonwealth to build any sft. 3in.
lines... .A.11.G.: Only one reason for not printing
“Fake” ; the Red Page section has too long a wait-
ing list already... .Shot: But what good will your
mere say-so be unless some reasons are given—or
your name 1.... Deirdre: Correct and fair ; but work
in sonnet form must be really good to pass....
Madeleine B.: Idea of a decomposed corpse creeping
on his girl’s breast is too horrible... .J.K.M.: Not
bad, but imitative. Get on to bush themes.... Tal
J.: “Duplicity” very well done, but hardly worth
while... .N.S.M.: Too dangerous to encourage depend-
ence on that sort of accident.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
P.U.P.: Your joke is so subtle that it eludes us.
. ...J.: Shaky sketch and the quotation has been
twisted that way before... .C.A.R.C.: Simplicity of
the bushwhacker carried to the extreme; and, any-
way, the drawing is impossible C.T.W.: If that
cowbell gag arrives again we’ll have to plug our
ears... .L.M.: It’s a toss-up which of the three
annoys us most... .N. 8.8.: Your frail neddy was
yarded with the rejects. .. .W.W.: Had you exhibited
it, that car would have been the sensation of the
Sydney Motor Show.... K.W.: Do all the men your
way have long left legs?. .. .C.A.: The sportive widow
is a drab creature... .H.R.: Unintelligible joke and

“E.M.W.” : A few weeks ago I bought a
small quantity of rice from a local grocer,
and on opening the packet was struck by a
marked though • indefinable difference in its
appearance from that to which I was accus-
tomed. When boiled the difference was more
marked, the grains being larger and whiter.
I made inquiries and found I had pur-
chased home-grown rice, retailed here (Tam-
worth, N.S.W.) at per pound. I don't
ask for any better.

“Borom” : The other day it was chronicled
that a couple of Sydney bookmakers had
found some split pound-notes among their
takings. Surely this is the most dangerous
and least remunerative of all forms of coun-
terfeiting. It is accomplished generally by
damping the note, starting at one corner, and
then patiently working on it until the two
layers divide, after which thin paper is
pasted on each half so as to give it thickness.
The person to whom the faked notes are offered
has only to turn them over to discover the
fraud. Hence they are usually “put off” on
racecourses or other places where money is
taken without close inspection.
“Larrapinta” : Australian bee-keepers have
combined to send It. E. G. McDonald to
England and America to study marketing
methods and investigate the possibilities of
opening up an export trade in Australian
honey. McDonald is one of put leading
apiarists, who runs 1000 colonies Of bees.
He intends to see what honey is most popular
on the English market, with the object of
producing a blend of Australian honeys of
a similar flavor and color. His itinerary will
include a trip to Northern Italy, the home of
the Ligurian and Carniolian strains of bees,
and be hopes to bring back some extra-choice
queen bees to improve the quality of Aus-
tralian hives.

“Harold Ilardupp”: Seventeen of the 32
seizures of opium credited to the Common-
wealth Customs last year were made in
W.A.; there were, only five in Queensland
and four in N. S. Wales. A few years ago
exhaustive and fruitless searches on boats
coming direct from “the East” indicated that
the stuff was taking some other route, and
further investigation brought conclusive evi-
dence that the traffickers Were sending the
contraband to England, where it whs tran-
shipped to agents on boats hitherto passed
with scanty inspection. _ After that thebe was
a substantial increase in the Captures. The
Transcontinental railway has led to W.A.
being favored by smugglers.

“ J.S.*: Fashions in bricks are just as
changeable as fashions in frocks. Kilns pro-
vide four classes of bricks, as a rule —first*,
seconds, thirds and clinkers. A few years
ago builders w.ould look at duly firsts and
seconds —perhaps a ’few tllii-ds. The idea of
THE ART OF THE SALESMAN.
“These stockings you sold me yesterday have
ladders in them."
“Ah, part of the design — ‘Elopement’ stock-
ings, Madam.”
clinkers being good goods would have been
laughed at. These are bricks burnt more
than the others, and generally blue-black.
A year or two ago some enterprising builders
began to use clinkers in ornamental courses,
and the notion caught on at once, with the
result that the works soon sold out all their
stocks of previously almost valueless material.
Now the price of clinkers is actually higher
than that of first-grade.
* * * *
“C”: “Brady’s Lookout” merely repeats a
tale told to tourists in his attempt (B.
6/l/’2T) to upset the claim of the Black
Horse, Richmond (N.S.W.), to be the oldest
licensed house in Australia, in favor of the
Bush Inn, New Norfolk (Tas.). The cold
facts are that New Norfolk was not laid
out till early in 1820, and Mrs. Anne Brid-
ger, who, according to “8.L.,” received her
license in 1810, didn’t even see Tas. till 1823,
when she arrived in Hobart by the brig
Thalia, from the Cape of Good Hope. In
October she became the licensee of the Half-
way House at the Black Snake (now South
Bridgewater). The Bush Inn, which was
built for her, was completed in April, 1825,
and licensed the following September.
* * * *
“Fenj”: In a recent par. commenting on
the number of deep-sea motor-ships visiting
Australian ports. “Crojack” suggested it was
time the Australian shipowners woke up to
the march of progress in this form of sea
carriage. The obstacle is that most of them
are directly interested in the Newcastle coal-
fields. So also the largest British shipping
companies are steadily building steamships
in preference to motor-ships—for the reason
that Britain and the British Empire are
rich in coal, but lacking in oil supplies.
“Britain’s case,” as a Huddart Parker book-
let lately said, “is also Australia’s case in
this matter.” British shipowners are more
concerned in developing increased efficiency
in steam propulsion by increased boiler
pressure, higher degrees of super-heat and
improved turbines than in considering the
advantages of motor propulsion.

IF YOUR BOY WANTS A RIFLE
he wants one that is ACCURATE, one that is RE LIABLE, and one that is SAFE TO HANDLE
The celebrated “WINCHESTER” Models 02 and 04 possess all these qualities. They shoot
either the .22 short, long, long-rifle or extra-long cartridges—four different loads —with that
deadly accuracy for which the name “WINCHESTER” is world-famous. Their actions are so
simple and strong that there is nothing to get out of order. The bolt action closes right over
the head of the cartridge and protects the shooter from any risk of blowbacks. And—these
rifles are cheap.

The New Method of Shaving
NO BRUSH. NO SOAP.
ś
Is it not strange that for hundreds of years man has bet:,
scrubbing his face with soaps full of soda, and has never reason
that under such treatment the skin must suffer? Nothing isi mon
ugly than a face that looks raw. Shaving soaps are aw a. .
the same old method of shaving. They are made with soda.
But now we have discovered the natural method, Y'kere rr
brush and soaps full of soda are needed. Shavex is a skin •
One can shave in half the time, and you will get a smoother a'-,
closer shave than you have ever had, and shaving will beco
pleasure instead of a torture. Your skin will look and feel u-
satin, and your face under this treatment will look twice as youn„.
No after lotions are required when using
SHAVEX
MR. LESLIE HENSON, the famous
actor, writes:—“l use ‘Shavex’ every time I
shave, and think it is the quickest, cleanest
and most delightful preparation ever invented
for shaving.”

Died in England, aged 82, Sir Arthur
IJaslam. As the inventor and improver of
refrigerating machinery and processes, it
was he who first opened the world’s markets
to the producer of perishable commodities.
The Vic. Masons have bagged Baron
Somers for the job of principal gavel-
wielder. He will be installed in March.
Stradbroke was the last Governor who was
g.m., and Bice has been marking time till
Somers was ready. Ex-Premier Lawson, who
after nearly four years of it must be quite
accustomed to wearing the choicer bits of
embroidered silk, will probably have a shot
at the g.-m.-ship when Vic. gets a Governor
who has no taste for pinafores.
“Coot” : Clapp has struck pay ore in his
fruit-drink bar on the Flinders-street (Melb.)
station. During December over 132,000
drinks were sold to a thirsty public, with a
resultant profit of £2200 to the department.
On Christmas Eve £l5B was taken in ex-
change for 9480 drinks at fourpence each. And
what a boon to growers Clapp's enterprise
must be is shown by the fact that for the
season just ended his department purchased
900,0(X) cases of oranges and lemons, or
about 20,000 tons.
“Kayeff”: The silkworms which spin
milady’s silken hose need no mulberry leaves.
Their chief needs are wood-pulp and elec-
tricity. Artificial silk, or rayon, which helps
to clothe half the world, is made by pulping
wood and dissolving the pulp in an alkali.
The strongly alkaline solution is forced
through minute holes, from two- to five-
thousandths of an inch wide, into acid. Meet-
ing the acid, it coagulates into viscous
strings, which are whipped up and spun
into threads. From thread to loom is but a
short step, and the next step is the flapper’s.
A curious paragraph of social history
ended with the death in Germany of Houston
Chamberlain, the English renegade. Son
of a British admiral, Chamberlain was first
led to Germany on the flood of the Wagner
craze, which once made a pilgrimage to
Bayreuth as essential to the musical high-
brow as a trip to Mecca is to the Moslem, lie
married Wagner’s eldest daughter, and wrote
several books about pa-in-law. Germany
made the utmost use of his furious invectives
against Britain as war propaganda, but soon
discovered that the world despises a man
who is faithless to the land of his fathers.
Strange that Australia’s one great water-
way, which carries to the sea the drainage
of nearly half a million square miles ol terri-
tory, should bear the name of an obscure
English politician who had practically no-
thing to do with colonisation. Alexander
Hume, in 3824, discovered the Upper
Murray, and named it Hume River; but
when Sturt, six years later, explored its
lower reaches, lie named it after Sir George
Murray, a member of Wellington’s Cabinet,
who had had thrust on him for a few month?
the position of Secretary for War and the
Colonies, and of whom it was written that
he “displayed no qualifications for adminis-
tering a civil office.” Not many years back
school atlases showed the stream as “Hume
or Murray River,” but the latter name is the
only one in use now.
Whatever else it isn’t N.S.W. Upper
House is more representative than most
Chambers. There are 12 lawyers, 11 paid
trades-union officials, 6 graziers, 6 company
directors, 6 “retired” (including an ex-coal-
miner, ex-tailor, ex-compositor and ex-
cabinet-maker), 6 managers, 5 merchants, 4
physicians (one never practised and could
be added to the graziers), 4 journalists, 4
farmers, 3 estate-agents, 2 other “agents”
(one was once a saddler and the other a
country newspaperman), 2 engineers, 2 secre-
taries (Willis calls himself one), 2 men of
independent means (Innes-Noad and Joyn-
ton Smith), a brewer, registrar, storekeeper,
commercial traveller, clerk, industrial advo-
cate, painter, textile manufacturer, tobacco-
nist, carpenter, jeweller, butcher, miner,
teacher, hairdresser, shipwright, pattern-
maker, ex-teacher, partner in a boot factory,

“Sucre” : While I agree with Myall” (B.
6/l/’27) about the foolishness of talking
of cacao-cultivation in Queensland, I lock
horns with him about coffee- and sisal-hemp-
growing being departed dreams. Queens-
land’s coffee crop of 17 acres yielded 61601 b.
for 1925. It could soon be made to read
1700 acres if bad Australians didn’t drink
so much Turkish coffee. The sugar award
doesn’t stop cane-planting from being the
backbone of tropical Queensland, and there
is no better reason why it should do fatal
injury to coffee. Sisal-hemp can be, and is,
grown successfully in Queensland. T. H.
Wells, of Childers, dug out acres of cane
to give his crop of sisal-hemp elbow-room
over 25 years ago. There is an enormous
demand for sisal for rope-making and fibro-
cement work, and we, might profitably have
thousands of acres of the spiky plant grow-
ing. It’s just a matter of keeping out the
Japanese stuff by a stiff tariff, and the
same thing applies to rice and dates.
One of the original members of the Fabian
Society, an Austrian by birth but a Maori-
lander by choice, passed out by his own act
the other day because he was hurt by asper-
sions on his loyalty to the country of his
adoption. John Ignatius Fox, whose father
spelt his name “Fuchs,” was a prominent
member of the little band of Londoners, in-
cluding just-dead Belfort Bax and G. B.
Shaw, who 30 years ago preached so per-
suasively the beauties of collectivism. He
was educated at Oxford and emigrated to
Maoriland in early middle-age, after having
vainly tried to get into the House of Com-
mons on the Labor ticket —his opponent was
Rufus Isaacs, since Viceroy of India. He
hopped into the World War as soon as it
started, joining the N.Z.E.F., and after his
discharge he organised a club for Maori-
land Diggers in London. On returning to
Fernland he was for a while secretary
of the Returned Soldiers’ Association in
Wellington. Possibly had he been less enthu-
siastic a patriot he would have escaped
calumny, but when he settled down in Feild-
ing and became a borough councillor and
a pillar of society people recalled his birth-
place and said unkind things, and he was
too sensitive to stand it.

The Use of Rexona Soap
Ensures Beauty to Skin and Hair
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can be obtained by regular

Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate tex-
tuie. Even the best of such soaps can only cleanse—they cannot heal and prostect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams as 'Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin affections is known throughout
the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap regularly once or twice a day,
and see if it does not quickly

If I Were Queen.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF I were queen from pole to pole, with
the riches of the world
Spread round in peacock tapestries and
carpets piled like fleece;
If rubies burned on brow and breast and my
very shoes were pearled,
And over door and casement luscious
velvet shut in peace,
One windy day
I would slip away
To the rough bark of great tree-trunks, my
palms against their boles,
To the pleasant crunch of slipping sand
beneath my bare foot-soles.
If I were served by gentle- ladies on their
satin knees,
Who carried rainbow crystal-bowls like
bubbles of sheer dew,
With cates of cunning fashioning, and fruits
from foreign seas,
And slender flasks of wine that rivalled
every gem in hue,
Yet would I go
Through noonday glow
By the sparkle of salt water, and awake old
joy, old grief
With the dear, remembered bitterness of a
nibbled tea-tree leaf.
Most royally would I call in the blessed of
the earth
With magic in their fingertips, or voice
of liquid gold,
To make rare music, charm the hours with
dainty bells of mirth
Or organ notes of thunder like sweet
Heaven’s sorrow rolled;
But still at times
The perfect chimes
Would wasted fall on ears that heard beyond
their brilliant bars
A little lo.iely tree-frog shrilling to the
autumn stars.
If bearded travellers came to me with the
breath of perilous lands
Pent up in phial and casket, spoil of many
patient hours,
And opening them before my throne loosed
from their sun-bronzed hands
The fragrant-winghd souls of unimagined,
slaughtered flowers,
I would but long
For the freshness strong.
The keen, heart-shaking thrills that in one
precious moment pass
With the smell of the first raindrops on the
dust of fallen grass.
If I were queen and beautiful, my courtiers
all would bring
To please my fancy captured dreams and
visions of great men
In picture, statue, painted book, tall vase
or fretted ring,
Till wonder nigh grew wearisome the
winter through, and then
When sunmmer came
With skies aflame
I would alone in secret climb a twisting
track to see
Cliff daisies’ dear simplicity beneath a she-
oak tree.
If I were wisest of the wise and queen in
very sooth,
With skill to put old troubles straight,
with power to make and mend,
So that grey thinkers came to me to learn
tlie roads of truth
And took my guidance gravely—when a
certain little friend
With soft black fur
And cheerful purr
Tapped on my instep privily a pawed “Come
out and play,”
I would leave the reverend counsellors, and
run away, away!

RIKKI T.
Three Men in a Boat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EUTHLESSLY, from a cloud-free sky,
the sun beat down on that open
stretch of “Islands” sea, its relentless
rays instantly seizing upon and transforming
into dazzling points of light every ripple on
the silver-grey surface. If it moved at all,
scarcely perceptible was the drift of that
paint-blistered open boat, with its three
drooping, silent, sun-tortured occupants.
In his seat in the stern, “Jackpot” Wal-
ton now stirred uncomfortably; and, con-
templating lxis two companions with his
deep-set, restless eyes, once more asked him-
self which of the two it was to be.
Three days had now passed since the
copra-laden trading schooner Casuarina had
foundered ; three scorching, incidentless day 3
of sun and sea, endurable only by the pros-
pect of oncoming night, with its balm-pro-
viding coolness, its eye-relieving, purple
indefiniteness, but with all its uncertainties.
It had been Walton’s misfortune that, of
the four of his “boys,” three, through their
over-indulgence in that unusually-rich betel-
nut secreted aboard, were in a comatose
state at the time their services were most
needed ; otherwise the sagging, over-burdened
craft might have survived the thunderous
onslaughts—deceptive in their quickly-
gathering strength—of that venomous, mon-
soon-whipped sea. There was little con-
solation in the thought, but they had given
the storm a run for its money; the bruised
and salt-drenched skipper had told himself
when the three of them had taken to the
boat —himself, Feng and Lakoku. “Poor
devils !” later, with a regretful shake of his
leonine head, he had gone so far as to
say of the three helpless members of his
crew, abandoned there in the last-moment
rush to the boat. That was the extent
of his emotion; and now, in his growing
despair, he rather envied them tlieir fate.
No sign of land, of a coral reef even, of
a vessel of any kind—-and to-morrow would
be the fourth day! At the present rate there
were enough biscuits and water to last the
three of them for two days more. But
with one less drawing from the supply?
... .or two less? Walton made no mathema-
tical calculation; it sufficed him to know
that in either circumstance his span of hope
would be appreciutely lengthened. The time
had now come when, as a first measure,
the boat must be rid of Feng or Lakoku,
he told himself. But which of the two.'
A r ot the two altogether, at all events —his
growing dread of insanity had decided that.
Not yet would he elect to remain alone in
his misery and suffering here —unaided, too,
should a vessel be sighted, should land
appear.
Purposefully unconcerned though his gaze
was as he sought the bloodshot eyes of the
weazened Feng, seated the nearer to him,
Walton saw clearly that the aged Chinaman
understood.... But the discovery did not
seriously perturb him, so completely confi-
dent was he of his mastery, his race-superior-
ity, his immeasurably greater physical
strength. Had he needed support, and in
his hip pocket was his revolver —his only
faithful friend, he had been known to call
it. Whether Lakoku realised his half-formed
intentions, Walton, stroking his nondescript
beard thoughtfully, could not tell, the
native’s face inclined as it was. His gaze,
however, did not remain long on the dark
skinned, polished shoulders of Lakoku —
dark-skinned, for Lakoku was no ordinary
copper-hued Melanesian; he was a Buka
Island “boy,” as black as those beaded arm-
bands of his were white.
These companions of his—-one was yellow,
one was black. And, watching them there,
that thought persisted in the white man’s
mind. In all liis twenty years’ experience
of the Islands; not until these last three
days had Walton been really color-con-
scious. In studying the pair, the color
factor had come home to him with increas-
ing vividness. On the schooner, confined
though the conditions, lie had taken purely
a superficial view of color—had merely taken
the superiority of the white man for granted
and had been content to leave it at that.
It was no surface matter, this color!
There, drooping, they sat before him--
the yellow man and the black. And they,
too, Walton sensed, were fully color, con-
scious now. In their eyes, pre-eminently, he
was a white man; realisation of their in-
feriority was plainly evident in their eyes.
True, he had been their master whilst on the
schooner —and was still. But the gap
between them and him seemed far wider
now. Quite detectable, too, was the dis-
tinction between the Chinaman nnd the
native ; not, at first, had he been conscious
of it.
The yellow man or the black—which? No
need to ask how, anyway ; there, right along-
side, was the receptive fathomless sea, and,
if necessary, he could shoot. In the event of
rescue, of what avail, it proffered, a China-
man’s or a native’s testimony? Of even a
white man’s, under such brain-turning cir-
cumstances ?
Which? His color-consciousness told Wal-
ton that he should spare the Chinaman first;
but his commonsense voted otherwise. For,
of the two men, the aged Feng showed the
more severe evidences of suffering, at times
looking almost on the point of self-surrender.
Furthermore, in recognition of his un-
doubtedly greater needs, he had been ration-
ing the Chinaman on a more liberal scale
than the native. Not, in this open boat,
had it been a case of share-and-share-alike ;
in his foresight, from the very first, Walton
had seen to that, nor had his high-handed
action been challenged. Searehingly, he had
looked for signs of resentment, but had
found none. So secure of himself had he felt
that, with his body sprawled across the
cask of water, lie had even endeavored to
sleep.
Feng or Lakoku? At last Walton stirred
With a sudden resolve, his thin lips tighten-
ing, the furrows on his haggard face deepen-
ing. The sea, of a sudden, seemed to him
even less silent; it seemed as if the whole
universe awmited his decree. So far his
purpose was undetected, he saw. He made
t 0.... But his hand was stayed. Sharply
an unexpected, inarticulate cry of Feng’s
pierced his consciousness and upset his
poise. Collecting himself, Walton followed
the direction of the Chinaman’s outstretched
arm. He could now discern, a short dis-
tance away to starboard, floating on the
water, a small, square object. A wooden
box, it appeared to be; and at the dis-
covery his underlip drooped in disappoint-
ment.
“Bockis [box] ’long there !” Lakoku, now
on his feet, shouted encouragingly.
“Right, Feng! You catchem oar, too,
Lakoku!” Stirred to action, Walton now
commanded gruffly. Though cursing in-
wardly at first, somehow he now welcomed
the diversion.
Painfully the Chinaman and the native
bent to their oars. A dozen or so strokes, and
now Walton was leaning over the boat’s
side. Feng and Lakoku devouring witnesses
of his action, he seized hold of the object.
It was a box, all three now knew. What
could it contain? What did it contain?
each asked himself in eager anticipation.
Walton was still tugging at its shining brass
catch. At last he succeeded in prising the
lid open.
“Well, I’ll be ! A set of draughts !*’
Walton ejaculated. “So this board unfolds,
eh?” In disgust he made to fling the box
and its contents back into the sea. But
Feng’s quick touch of his arm restrained
him.
“Me play draughts—you play him too?”
said Feng, something amounting almost to
eagerness entering into his eyes.
Walton’s brutal face softened slightly in
amusement. Once more he contemplated the
box.
Draughts! Rather a tame game for him,
Jackpot Walton, whose very nickname he
owed to his notoriety as a poker-player.
Draughts—a tame game indeed ! Neverthe-
less he found himself extracting some “men”
casually from the box. He eyed them specu-
latively where they lay on the palm of his
hand.
Those smooth little round pieces of wood
suddenly held for Walton a fascination. It
was not their shape, their touch, which held
his attention.
His eyes were sparkling now. These littl •
“men” —yellow and black. That question
which bad been troubling him, the question
to which, just prior to this diversion, he had

found a doubtful answer—the yellow man or
the black? A tame game, draughts. Ordi-
narily, yes. But Yes, an excellent idea!
A better way here of deciding the matter!
Walton made no attempt to restrain his
chuckle. At poker more than once he had
staked his all; but here was something quite
different—impersonal to some degree, but
with an undeniable appeal. With the little
black “men” he would play for the life of
Lakoku ; with the little yellow pieces Feng
must play for his!
With an evil grin Walton now looked at
Feng and nodded assent. It would, lie saw,
be quite unnecessary to state his conditions
of play, so clearly did that expression in the
Chinaman’s eyes signify Comprehension.
But what of Lakoku? Should he explain
o the native, W alton wondered. Yes, lie
supposed so But, on second thoughts, no
1 eng already comprehending, it would add
zest to the game if Lakoku were kept m
ignorance of the issue at stake. Walton
inwardly congratulated himself on this
ecision.
1 e boat being almost motionless on that
placid sea, the game presented no practical
difficulty. Pushing the thoroughly mystified
Lakoku aside, Walton, with the box tucked

after but momentary deliberation, licking
the salt from his fingers, Feng moved a
“man ”
And so, in that strange setting, the game
began. Of little consequence, mostly give-
and-take, were the preliminary moves. But
e ven they were made in silence. Had the
two players observed it, Lakoku showed no
sign of understanding of the game or of
what depended on it. But liis interest seemed
to focus on the little black “men.”
More deliberate now became the moves,
In its smooth, swift flight a venturesome
gull, swooping low, passed by unnoticed.
Alongside him presently Feng had a dis-
orderly stack of five “men”—five to Walton’s
orderly three. But Walton was playing the
bolder game. Soon, by clever foresight he
effected a double capture; there was some-
thing undeniably vicious in the way his
blistered fingers, tenaciously gripping liis
“man,” bridged those two yellow pieces.
With a resounding clatter the little black
piece came to rest on a square at least tem-
porarily secure
To Walton, too, fell the honor of the first
“king”; Feng was beginning to pay the
penalty for liis lack of enterprise. His hand
shook perceptibly. Since he had entered into
the game a change had come over the China-
man; completely vanished now was that
indifference, that disregard for life, born of
his sufferings. Life was something worth
while, worth striving to retain, his entry into
the game had brought him to realise.
Meantime Lakoku's eyes had never
left the board. Of little account in
his eyes were those attacking- and
counter-moves; all his interest centred
on each “take” —not in the accom-
plishment but in the action itself. Ignorant
though he was of the purpose of the game,
each success of the “black” met with his
inward acclaim.
“Buck up, or I’ll be slaughtering you,
Feng!” taunted Walton as he ruthlessly
capped another yellow “man.” But it was
Walton who was in need of a warning.
To the native there had been something
strongly suggestive in that early vicious
double “take” of Walton’s. His blood-lust
had been aroused thereby, and each succes-
sive “take” had served to stimulate his
vicious desire.’ Therein lay his interest in
those clattering “kills” of the little wooden
pieces, an interest aroused now to fever-
point. That last more than usually vicious
“take”
His lips working convulsively, his eyes
blurred, Lakoku sprang. Walton was the
figure the nearer to him, and already sinewy
black fingers were clutching at the white
man’s throat. Totally unprepared for the
attack, Walton was unable to withstand
that force. Ilis legs shot up from beneath
him and, striking the seat—the shock dislodg-
ing the “men”—served as a leverage for the
native. With that sudden weight to one
side, the boat rocked precariously, causing
Feng to cry in alarm.
At last Walton managed to free his legs,
and, kicking frantically, forced himself nearer
the gunwale so as to raise himself. The
boat now lurched dangerously, and before
the amazed Chinaman had realised it the
pair were struggling in the water, Lakoku
still clinging to Walton’s throat.
Paddling fiercely with his feet, Lakoku
endeavored to thrust the white man’s head
beneath the surface, but with a quick squirm
Walton succeeded in releasing himself.
Spluttering, he struck feebly at the native;
then, realising the extent of his exhaustion,
he made for the boat, Lakoku quickly
following. A pair of white hands now
gripped the gunwale; a pair of black hands
followed. Out of fear Feng retreated, and,
stumbling, fell.
In his cramped position in the bottom
of the boat Feng now saw what had caused
him to stumble. Almost instantly there
came to him the realisation of what it might
mean for him to have undisputed possession
of the cask of water lying there.
Quickly the Chinaman struggled to his
feet and seized an oar. Throwing it aloft,
he crashed it down on the hands first of
Walton and then of Lakoku. The cries of
pain and despair heightened his frenzy.
Greedily, gauging not its contents. Feng
drank from the cask. When satisfied he
looked up and gazed vacantly upon the
molten, featureless sea.
* * * *
His favorite spot is beneath a tall casu-
arina in front of the broad, bougainvillaea-
clad verandah of the Asiatic ward of the
hospital—an aged Chinaman whose name,
the medical officer will tell you, is Feng.
Quite an institution he is; yes, he will be
there until he dies. Never does he appear
to tire of his greasy, thumb-marked draught-
board with its little round wooden “men.”
To and fro across the board throughout the
day he pushes them —the yellow pieces and
the black. One of the “men” is painted
white, you will observe. “Some curious fad
of his —he insisted on it.” And the medical
officer, with a shrug of his shoulders, leaves
it at that.
HORTON BROOKS.
The Eyes of John Denne.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A LL because he had not the right, com-
manding eyes.
So he told himself, in sober earnest-
ness, regarding these orbs in his cheap apart-
ment looking-glass. Therefore must he go
lower, instead of higher, failing in that
managerial capacity which was necessary in
this branch of the great engineering profes-
sion. For nothing could change this lack.
Of this he was certain. One could exercise
and strengthen a somewhat weedy figure.
One could take one’s voice to an elocutionist,
and one’s mind to the psychologist. John
Denne seemed to have been thus conveying
himself fragmentarily almost for years. One
could read little grey books, and try the
courses of persons who advertised “This is
for YOTJ,'” sticking a huge finger at the
reader. One could do all this, with what
result? Some. There is always some. But
nothing to make up for those somewhat pale,
soft-looking eyes, the right flickering a little.
His eyes were the reason why John Denne
had failed to hold his own, more especially at
those “close-ups” round the table, when leaders
come, blandly or otherwise, to breathe of
strikes.
So now, because of his eyes, he, John
Denne, was to be sacked.
All at once he sprang from his waiting-
chair. No need, anyway, to keep his Blanche
waiting. She always consoled him with her
talk of novels, and films and sheiks, and all
the rest of it. Thank Heaven, managerial
capacity was not wanted in a love affair!
So he thought, incorrectly maybe.
As he put on a hat that shaded those
two amiable optics of his, his landlady
thrust in an aggressive arm, with a letter —
“Here, young man” —made contemptuous,
too, no doubt, by those flickering, irresolute
orbs.
It was a letter from his Blanche, ex-
cusing herself from the interview, also from
her engagement with him....
Three hours later, suburban inhabitants
might have noticed a young man, with
curiously mild eyes and dust on coat and
feet, watching a painter, who was up the
ladder, daubing the side of a house. They
did not know that the gazer saw nothing of
the work, that he was in a wretched dream,
that he was merely wondering whether his
long tramping to and fro had sufficiently
tired him. Perhaps there had been a lack
of managerial capacity in choosing the
painter. At any rate the brush, slipping
from a slack hand, turned over in the ait
with its heavy burden of poisonous paint.
* * * •
Fifteen months later, in another town “re-
nowned for its manufacturing and engineer-
ing works,” two men in the office of one
of them were each enjoying a sociable
“spot.”
“My sub-manager, Mr. Denne? Yes, he’s
been with us now for nearly a year. A
bit new for the position? Yes, but that
doesn’t count nowadays. Man-managing ability
—you know, that counts nowadays, just as
woman-managing ability counted in old
times. The men? The workers? They’re
like women ki these times. Not that I’m
blaming them for being troublesome and a
problem.”
"That’s to say, they’ve risen from being
serfs to being mentally like yelling suffra-
gists, and later” —the other was a “bit of a
democrat” —“they’ll be men, and understand
give and take. Meanwhile”
“Meanwhile Denne’s managing them, dur-
ing the betwixt-and-between stage, if that’s
what it is. That strike he quelled not long
after he’d come —I won’t forget it. Didn’t talk
much, you understand; simply looked them
down. So you knew him at Spossards. How
on earth did they come to let him go?”
Forrester drained his glass. “Why, he
doesn’t seem to have impressed them much.
But what I’m concerned about regarding
him is a bit of a romance. A girl cousin
of my wife’s was engaged to him, and threw
him over. Since she’s seen him again, the
magic’s come back. Why did she turn him
down in the first place? Oh, not enough
the bandit and eagle-eyed sheik.”
“Women ! Just because a man can’t give
her the once-over, she thinks he’s mother’s
blue-eyed baby wifli everyone else. Let the
girl disguise herself as a Lenin-minded
workman, and ask an interview then!”
In his handsome apartments, at that very
moment, John Denne was reading a tender
little note signed “Blanche.” Only once did
he raise his steely look to fix it on the maid
who knocked to inquire about to-morrow’s
breakfast, because the landlady had said that
whoever else she was going to offend it
wouldn’t be Mr. Denne.
He turned back to the page: “Why did I
never appreciate you before? Oh, it isn’t
you’re getting on. It’s yourself, so mag-
netic.”
“My eagle gaze,” he murmured,” which
helped me a year ago, and then gave me
such confidence that, when I found out the
reason, I kept going. Well, she’ll have to
know before the marriage—if she’s still will-
ing for that—this source of my kingliness,
this change which made my ‘managerial
capacity.’ Fortunately, it was the softer of
the two I lost, the one that flickered. Here’s
for the little fellow that made my career.''
A quick jerk, and it lay on his hand, well
made, of the latest design, formed to move
in its socket, and do everything except look
soft, stupid, flicaer and blink —a splendid,
grey-irised, artificial right eye!

MOTOR MOWER
AT SPECIAL CUT PRICES FOR THE
1926 SEASON.
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the neces-
sity of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, &c. _ . .
it is fitted with a 2|-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one at-
tendant for guiding purposes. , _ . . ... „„„
The running cost of an “Atco,” thanks to the scientific precision of its con-
struction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely cut
1000 square yards of turf on a fdel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol and
oil mixture.^j|^ afJ extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
With the object of making this ALL-BRITISH MOWER more popular on
the Australian market, we are offering them for season 1926 at specially reduced
prices. Full stocks on hand.
PRICES :~l4in.' cutters, £47/10/-; 16in., £57/10/-; 18in.,
£67/10/-; 22in., £B2/10/-; 24in., £9O; 30in., £llO each.

It Took 3 Years
to Build the Whippet
Imitations will
follow but
no Equals for
Years to Come
T-’HE new Overland Whip-
pet—has started a revolution-
ary trend in light motor
car design and performance. All
other light cars must follow the
Whippet’s lead or be swept into
discard.
For three years Overland engi-
neers in Europe and America have
been designing, developing, and
perfecting the new Whippet. Half
a million miles of gruelling road
tests have satisfactorily proved its
out-standing superiorities. It
challenges all former engineering
practice ... it is radically differ-
ent from anything you have ever
known before.
Study its amazing
performance
The Overland Whippet will travel
over 55. miles an
hour in perfect
comfort. It will
pick-up in 13 sec-
onds from 5 to 30
miles an hour.
It will go 35 miles
on an Imperial
/ . . . gallon of petrol
and more than 1000 miles on a
gallon of oil.
Designed for power
It has a “high-torque”, 31 horse-
power motor of small bore and
long stroke —the same engineer-
ing principle used in the fastest
racing cars of America and Europe.

The Overland Whippet establishes entirely new standards of perform-
which light cars from now on must be judged.
; ' '-> s * • * '-.i • ■ '
It runs like a “Six” and pulls with
amazing power . . . over steep
hills, deep mud and sand.
In traffic the Overland Whippet
gets away with lightning pick-up
—-stop-watch tests show that it ac-
celerates up to 40 miles an hour,
18% faster than other 4-cylinder
cars. *- '
4-wheel brakes are an integral part
of this new car’s chassis design.
Measured tests show it will stop
in two car lengths from a speed
of 25 miles an hour.
Modern body design
The Whippet has a long, low body
of advanced design, finished in
durable Duotone Duco with black
beading. With top up it is only
5 feet 9 inches high—not as high
as the average man—-yet it provides
more room and cothfort than you
have ever found in any motor car
of this class before.
See this new-type car—-ride in it—
drive it. Be fair to yourself. A
demonstration may save you from
buying an obsolete car*
