by HOLDEN. Out to drive you wild.
Now you can keep a sports machine...
and keep a family too.
Three ways.
First. Monaro gives you sports motoring, and
lets you take the wholefamily along. Because as well
as two huggy bucket seats up front, there’s another
big seat in back. With room for three adults, or a
whole handful of children.
Secondly, you don’t have to be a mining millionaire
to own a Monaro. Because there are three models,
at prices starting from a startling $2,575 tax paid.
Each has the same basicformulaof magnetic
styling, tight handling, and long distance comfort.
Thirdly, once you’ve bought one, Monaro continues
to be easy to own. It’s a Holden, so it’s reliable.
And whetheryou’re in Canberra or Carnarvon, it’s easy
to find service and spares.
In fact, Monaro is one of the most sporting
propositions you’ll ever be made.
Have a Holden Dealer prove it to you.

The Parmelia will open late this year.
The executive housekeeper, the chefs, the waiters,
the maids are all working now.
At the Aldelphi.
When the Parmelia opens, the Adelphi
will close. And we will change uniforms.
From the very beginning we will make
the Parmelia one of Australia’s
finest hotels.
International in every respect.

Must be a link missing here.
Any area of your business relying on
"blotter calculation"? Then, frankly, you
have a link missing. A vital link in a
system planned not only to cut out such
risky "blotter calculations", put to bring
you a dramatic increase in over all effici-
ency and hence contribute to a greater
profitability.
For instance, our experts can after
a fact-finding survey plan a Link-
System for you in which you link a
Remington Calculator to a-Remington
accounting machine linked to a Rem-
ington Rotaprint.
Even with the basic system you would
be in an advantageous position of being
able to calculate, handle all book-keeping
details, typing, and at the same time
print all necessary documents even
in colour.
Get the idea ? And whatever Link-
System you may need, we also guarantee,
without cost to you, to train your staff
(including EDP people) to efficiently
operate that system. Your enquiry will
be given our experts' complete concen-
tration. And security. All obligation-free
of course.

ney, has a wax effigy of flier Sir
Charles Kingsford Smith, who died in
1935.
DEFINITION
“I’M NO FEMINIST but I do
believe women should have equal
opportunity and, of course, equal pay,”
Dr. Beryl Nashar is quoted as saying
when she was appointed Dean of the
Faculty of Science at Newcastle Uni-
versity last week. Which rather leaves
open the question of what is a feminist.
LOOKING AHEAD
THE SYDNEY REGION plan, issued
by the N.S.W. State Planning Authority,
has been fairly well received by town-
planners, although it is clear to even
the layman that what looks visionary
in the elegant maps and reports of
the Authority can look pretty shabby
indeed when it is translated into the
language of the average developer or
wheeler-dealer alderman.
Sydney town-planner, Mr. George
Clarke, as mentioned on page 48
of The Bulletin this week, has
already left behind the concept t>f a
Wollongong-Sydney-Newcastle conurba-
tion, which the State Planning
Authority presents as fairly revolu-
tionary, and is thinking in terms of
a Townsville-to-Eden entity.
In 1964 Mr. Clarke wrote a piece for
The Bulletin on Sydney A.D. 2000,
which outlined a basic scheme very-
much like the one the Authority has
now put forward. He wrote then that
the Authority’s biggest task would be
to decide upon a coherent pattern of
development for the whole central coast
region from Port Stephens to Kiama.
If the Authority had been quicker off
the mark in absorbing Mr. Clarke’s
ideas we might now be translating the
highly colored maps and imaginative
prose of the report into something
more lasting.
DANGER MONEY
NEW SOUTH WALES parliamen-
tarians are beyond doubt the dogs of
Australian politics. They claim they
are kept twice as busy with constituency
work as the politicians of any other
State, and probably ten times as busy
as Federal politicians: pensions and tele-
phones are Federal matters, but almost
anything else under the sun that affects
people comes on to the State Members’
table. On top of this, the N.S.W.
Members work in an ancient slum in
Macquarie Street.
The 100-year-old debate about their
conditions was resumed last week in
the N.S.W. Parliament. A few new
notes were struck. One Member com-
plained that if he was hard to hear it
was because his tongue was swollen
from licking stamps. Members lick
stamps and envelopes and do their own
filing. This office-boy’s work can take
hours each week. Another Member said
he brought his own toilet paper to
Parliament House because the disposal-
store material provided there was
unsuitable. Another said his shirt stuck
to his body because of the soot that had
fallen on to him from the ceiling.
Another said N.S.W. politicians had
the dirtiest fingernails in Australia,
because the shoe-cleaning brush is so
filthy. It was also suggested that the
Minister for Labor should prosecute
Parliament for employing secretarial
staff (“amanuenses,” as they call them)
in rooms that are fire hazards, and
for inviting schoolchildren into
galleries that are fire hazards.
The N.S.W. Parliament House is a
150-year-old structure —built in 1816
as a temporary building—and con-
demned annually ever since. In the past
century, complaints took the form of
questions: “Is the Premier aware that
one of my constituents has just fallen
through the floor of my room and
broken his leg?” This theme continues
today, but the emphasis is more on
working conditions. Most Honorable
Members share rooms —in one case
eight to a room —and daily climb four
steep flights of stairs to see their
amanuenses; coronaries grow common.
Perhaps the best hope for Members is
that the building will be condemned
as a menace and a fire hazard to
Sydney Hospital.
STEADY LIVING
CECIL HOLMES ordered another rum
and a small beer as a chaser and shook
his head impatiently. “Look,” he said,
“there’s a lot of hogwash talked about
directing films. If there’s any art in it,
it’s the art of imposing your will on
two things — the material you’ve got to
take, and the crew who are shooting it.”
He made it sound simple enough. But
then he has been working on films one
way and another for nearly 20 years —
and all the time in Australia. While
other people scream for Government
subsidies and quotas, or go hopefully
Cecil Holmes ... roving assignment
chasing after the latest American who
arrives here with half an idea and a
hatful of promises, Holmes, now in his
forties, has gone his own quiet way,
turning out anything from priceless
anthropological records to a feature
about bushrangers.
The bushranging film “Captain
Thunderbolt” was made in 1950.
Holmes shot it with one camera, used
the Armidale district as a location. Sir
Benjamin Fuller backed Holmes to the
tune of £15,000 and got twice that
amount back —it sold extraordinarily
well, for some reason, in Germany.
Another feature film, “Three in One,”
didn’t do so well. There were difficulties
with distributors, apparently because
they thought it was too Left-wing in its
attitudes. Some of the money came
from Frank Hardy’s eastern European
royalties and the rest from a group who-
Holmes describes as “liberal Jewish
garment manufacturers in Melbourne.”
The film was made up of three
stories: one by Frank Hardy, another
by Henry Lawson, and an episode by
Ralph Peterson. It was successful at
film festivals and had some European
distribution, and the backers eventually
got back about 10/- in the pound.
Holmes is a complete film man. And

AN OPEN
LETTER TO
MANAGING
DIRECTORS
Subject:
The Sebel Design Award
Doubtless, you have in your organisation,
some person or persons who are employed in
the design of manufactured articles, be they
precision instruments, appliances or travel
goods.
These designers play a vital part in your
particular industry, and indeed in the ability of
Australia to reduce the staggering figure of
$55,000,000 per year that is remitted overseas
to pay for “know-how” and royalties on
design. This situation can not be allowed to go
on and with the wealth of brilliant designing
talent available in Australia it does not need to
go on. To foster this talent and to encourage
manufacturers to demonstrate originality, the
sebel design award has been instituted.
This Design Award is a bi-annual occasion
and offers prize money of $2,000. Obviously,
a company would not submit an entry for the
monetary awards alone, but remember, a
large amount of publicity will be given to the
award and this could result in favourable
public relations for your company.
I ask you to think carefully about this letter
and then call your design “Whizz-kids” in and
ask them if an entry for the ’69 Sebel Design
Award has been contemplated, and if not,
what can be done about it.
To succeed as a nation of manufacturers,
Australia must encourage these designers
who are important, though often overlooked
members of our companies. I repeat, please
don’t ignore this message ... Do something
about it Now!
Contact the Sebel Design Award, Box 225,
P.O. Bankstown, 2200. ’Phone 70.0771 for any
further information required.
Yours sincerely,
Harry Sebel.

he has not only made films but
distributed them. ‘"I’m grateful for the
experience I had as a distributor,” he
says. “I learned a great deal about
actually making films from, those tough
bastards down at Greater Union and
Hoyts.”
These days, Holmes is concentrating
on television, and has just gone back
to the Northern Territory on a roving
assignment for “This Day Tonight.” He
likes to think of himself, in fact, as a
regional film-maker, and wants to
concentrate on the northern part of
Australia. It’s clearly a part of the
country which he knows well, and
where his blunt, earthy personality can
overcome the difficulties of dealing with
prickly or reluctant subjects and winning
their confidence.
The ability to win people’s confidence
has, in fact, enabled Holmes to shoot
some of the most important films made
in Australia, although the audience is
confined in this case to specialist
students in anthropology. He has made
three of these, dealing with fertility-rite
ceremonies among Aborigines on Goul-
burn Island, the Roper River, and
Croker Island.
They range in length from three to
six hours and can’t be shown to the
general public because of what Holmes
describes as their “sacred and secret”
nature. These were made specifically for
the Institute of Aboriginal Studies.
Generally, there’s a refreshing modesty
and lack of cant about Holmes’ attitude
to film-making — although he’s probably
the most successful individual film-
maker in Australia. At least, he’s been
able to earn his living at it for something
over 20 years.
He’s mildly tolerant about the young
Turks of the “new wave” and the
“underground” movement. “It’s fashion-
able these days,” he says, “to speak
about the language of film as if what
has gone on in the past is a bit old hat.
They forgot people like Grierson and
McClaren. I can see a danger of be-
coming preoccupied with form, of
becoming impatient with content, even
merely playing games with the medium.”
His own attitudes? “Some years ago,
I thought what I had to do was express
my own ideas, try to put across some
intense personal vision, almost a propa-
gandist attitude. Nowadays, now that
I’ve grown up, or grown older, or what-
ever happens to you, I’m simply
interested in looking at what people
call the human condition, from a Sydney
socialite to a Northern Territory native,
and transferring that person accurately
to film.” JOHN MOSES.

batiks to a mixed show at Melbourne’s
Arts and Crafts Society, litho prints
and batiks to Myers, in Melbourne, and
now she was on to paintings and pen-
and-ink washes for the Aladdin
Gallery’s exhibition in two days’ time.
The living-room of her tiny house
in East Sydney looked a well-stocked
craft shop. A cylindrical batik lamp-
shade hung from the ceiling, a bundle
of New Guinea spears bought in the
Blue Mountains, of all places, stood
in a corner (“I swopped one of my
paintings for them”),, there were batik
wall-hangings, a red dresser painted
with Bavarian designs, and lino cuts
and framed pen-and-wash drawings
stacked against the walls.
Doreen Folkerts was born in
Munich, she and her family came to
Australia eight years ago, and she
still has an accent which does nothing
to slow down the speed of her con-
versation. Words tumble out.
“I came to live in Sydney because
I wanted to paint the terrace-houses.
I drive along in my van until I see
a house I like, and I think, beauty!
and I get out and sit on a little
cushion and paint.
“Oh, yes, people are always stopping
to look, especially children, but they
make the best comments. People in
the country are kind. They’re always
rushing out with chairs for me to sit
on. But I like to sit down low and
feel part of what I’m painting. If you
get an easel out, and so on, it’s just
not the sam£.”
She studied batik (a waxing and
dyeing process done on fabrics) in
Munich. It is an art which originated
in Indonesia, but the Dutch took it
back to Europe, and Doreen Folkerts
uses the process to make abstract
designs — bolder than the intricately
designed ones of the Indonesians.
Since coming to Australia, she’s had
several jobs — as a designer of murals
and display work for a Melbourne
store, a graphics designer for tele-
vision, and a color consultant for a
textile firm. She decided to freelance
two years ago, when she was fired
from a job with a film company
designing backgrounds for animated
films because she took time off to
deliver paintings to an exhibition.
The exhibition, she thought at the-
time, was more important than the
job. Now she’s sure of it.
JOHN HANNAN—LANDSCAPE
GARDENER
MR. JOHN HANNAN, Landscape
Gardener, of North Ryde, has written
claiming that there are a number of
inaccuracies in the article published
in the issue of The Bulletin of 19th
October, 1968.
He claims that the article attributes
to him a number of things which were
not in fact said to the reporter and
gives an impression that he is con-
temptuous of his clients and has little
regard for their wishes or their privacy.
Mr. Hannan wishes to make it quite
clear that he has the highest regard
for the various clients for whom he
has worked in the past and was not
aware when speaking to The Bulletin
reporter that any of the details of his
contracts with clients would be publicly
disclosed.

WHEN HIGH-RISE
REALLY MEANS
"SKYSCRAPER"
YOU MAY have noticed it is not done
to talk to people any more, to have
conversation, or to hold interviews on
television. Indeed no, in the year of
our Lord 1968 you always conduct
dialogue. Furthermore, political candi-
dates don’t need to have verve or
personality they require something
much more mysterious than that. Last
year it was elan or panache. This year
the commentators have come up with
something much better, “charisma”; as
a vote-puller a man must have charisma,
and from all the reports 1968 is pretty
punk, charismatically speaking.
Nor, any more, do we have tall
buildings, and it is considered unbear-
ably vulgar to talk about skyscrapers.
No, we have high-rise buildings or high-
rise apartments. If you haven’t been to
Melbourne lately, then you will be
astonished by the high - rising that is
going on, not so much by the 20- and
30-storey insurance palaces—we get one
of those every week but by the
incredible circle of towers that the
Housing Commission has put up to
replace the old slums in the near-city
areas of Carlton, North Melbourne,
South Melbourne, and Prahran. They
vary in quality, some are pleasing to
the eye, but some assault the eye with
appalling 200 ft. walls of concrete. Here,
too, there is a searching after tone. One
of the biggest areas, with two 20-storey
blocks, is on the old site known in our
town these 100 years or so as Debney’s
Paddock. Gentlemen, it is now Debney’s
Meadow.
Of course, the terror over the past
ten years, the fear that has made
retailers go white over their balance
sheets, has been drift of population to
the great Chadstone, Southland beyond,
and elsewhere. Once upon a time
Flinders Street and Collins Street were
all superb cash-register areas with
booming department stores with names
like Snows, Craigs, Mutual Store, and
others. Now the only street worth
shareholders’ interest is Bourke Street.
The best way to save Melbourne is to
get people to live there. The retailers’
and the planners’ dream would be to
have 500,000 people within three miles
of the G.P.O. Now there are fewer than
200,000. Just to show you how serious
the situation has been, the city, as a
recruiting area for footballers, turned so

poor that the St. Kilda team had to
move out to Moorabbin. This was a
shock to Melbourne as great as the
shock to New York when the Dodgers
deserted Brooklyn for the West Coast.
The Housing Commission of Victoria
is doing more with high-rise buildings
and slum clearance than any other
organisation in the country. Just to
give you some idea, the Commission’s
biggest project is approaching comple-
tion. It is 30 storeys high and it’s a
whopper. How can one describe it?
You know those pictures of Moscow
University that are always being pumped
out by the Left-wing book shops? It
stands out on the skyline just like that,
an enormous white pile. The Housing
Commission went in and bought four
acres of South Melbourne slum for
$590,000,. on which there were 64 houses,
18 factories and business premises, and
a pub. They shifted the lot. South
Melbourne was actually named by a
temperance organisation. The original
name was Emerald Hill, and when the
Father Matthew Temperance Society
was holding its picnic there was no
name for the area, so they advertised
it to take place on the Emerald Hill. So
the Housing Commission is keeping up
this fine old total abstinence tradition
by clearing pubs.
The area before, in 65 houses, catered
for 178 people. Now in one building it
will house 1028 in 299 flats. That is, it
will have a population only slightly
less than Lome or Apollo Bay and
rather more than Cowes or Jeparit.
The building has been designed for an
absolute minimum of maintenance
copper pipes, metal windows, a surface
on the front of white aggregate and on
the back, around the balconies, red
jasper. The theory is that this symbolises
the South Melbourne football team. It
is impossible to get away from the
agony of our most meaningful culture
in this town.
Your correspondent went on a grand
tour of the building with the Housing
Commission director, Mr. J. P. Gaskin.
We could go only as far as the 28th
floor, because the 29th and 30th haven’t
been completed yet. We had the full
benefit of the refreshing winds that were
coming almost direct from Mawson,
but the view was unbelievable. To the
north we could see the mountains, where
the Hume Highway climbs over Pretty
Sally and the Great Divide. We could
see all the docks, the railway yards, the
Botanic Gardens, the Shrine, and
Government House, but we rather felt
that the best apartments could be on
the south-west corner —there you would
see the beaches right to Portsea, all
Port Phillip Bay, right into South
Melbourne footy ground, and, perhaps,
even some jolly good sunsets on the
water. The penthouse apartment with
this view, according to Mr. Gaskin,
would be $9.50 a week plus $1.25 for
services just a small apartment, but
with central heating, stove, built-in cup-
boards, and vinyl floor-coverings
provided.
There will be parking space for 200
cars, or more if necessary. Although

FJ42O
Housing Commission families are sup-
posed to earn less than $5O a week, it
can be surprising the number that turn
into two-car families. Near each flat
there will be a garbage chute which
will go straight down to a vast hopper,
where the South Melbourne garbage
truck will be able to back straight into
the building.
But, according to Mr. Gaskin, the
biggest trouble is the cartons the people
bring home from the supermarkets.
These tend to get stuck in chutes, maybe
up around the 20th floor, and they are
the devil to get out. “Why not have
large chutes?” one suggested innocently.
“They have to be big enough for
rubbish and too small for children,” he
replied.
One agreed that it would be bad
having tenants disposing of their chil-
dren in this way. Bottles also are a
problem. So on each floor there will be
special bottle cupboards, no doubt to be
called courage cupboards. These will
be cleared every day and someone will
make a little on the side.
Much has been written of the social
consequences of living in high rise.
Mothers feel isolated from their chil-
dren. When the children are in the
playgrounds provided below, parents
wonder what they are doing way down
there, and to overcome this, sometimes
they keep them forever locked up as
in a pigeon loft. There’s the problem
of boredom, of what to do with leisure
time, but it is significant that the turn-
over is almost zero. Once a family gets
into one of these towers, it is the devil
to get them out.
The actual quality of the buildings
and construction is remarkably high.
If great social problems take place in
South Melbourne, presumably the same
things happen in Toorak Road, Toorak,
where a penthouse might cost $30,000.
As Neil Clerehan, the architect, said
in the “Age,” it would be possible for
the Housing Commission to put up a
block in Toorak Road, call it Salisbury
Close, or Miami Waters, use a few
modish materials in the lobby, and the
accommodation wouldn’t really be any
different.
Except, of course, in Toorak they
would need different footy colors.

and also knowing her 11-year-old son,
she wants a case to carry it all in, she

in the sand.
Mr. Whitcombe, who runs Amateur
Astronomers, knows how far a deal
should go. He has been in many things
in his life, from bananas to broad-
casting, and at this point though the
customer has asked for a case, the
extra cost could swing things the other
way. No, he says, a case is not neces-
sary. The telescope’s got its own tailor-
made box and he will get Glen the
assistant to tie it with a handle so she
can carry it easily back to Cronulla.
“What,” sighs Mrs. Kathy Whit-
combe, typing in desultory fashion at
the far end, “what some mothers will
do for their children. All the way from
Cronulla to Crows Nest to spend a
fortune on an 11-year-old.” Coffee is
indicated. She disappears into a room
bristling with king-size telescopes and
plugs in the electric jug. Glen says could
he show his grinding? It might prove
interesting and at the same time explain
the frightful noise. What he refers to
is the grinding of mirrors which begins
at 9.30 every morning and goes on for
as long as everyone can bear it. That,
he says, pointing to a turntable churn-
ing out a high-pitched squeal, is run by
a dish-washing-machine motor. And on
it is an 8-inch diameter mirror, which
is very big in telescopes. He squirts
water from a Palmolive washing-up
liquid container, then washes his hands
carefully oh, it’s all very hygienic

enemy in this business—and goes into a

room where it is a constant 70 degrees,
otherwise the whole thing melts, and
throws on pink ceriumoxide 'to polish
the mirror. Actually, says Mrs. Whit-
combe, people who are mad about
astronomy fall into two groups: those
who get pleasure looking at stars and
those who get pleasure building their
telescopes. It’s the hand-grinding that’s
killing.
Outside, Eric Whitcombe is surrounded
by telescopes, microscopes, binoculars,
astronomical books, charts, atlases,
build-it-yourself kits, and this season’s
two new lines: celesial globes and elec-
tronic weather stations. The latter, he
says, are going well. It’s not that people
don’t trust the ABC, but there is some-
thing rather special in forecasting your
own weather; oh, mostly country people
have them, $99.75 a time they are,
which is a good psychological price.
The wind swings this—he whirls a
black disc with his finger—and that
registers on this dial, and this does that
to this, and so on. As for celestial
globes, he thinks they’ll go well
in schools. Funny thing is, he took
some to Brisbane and a man said
they’ll never sell here, which was
a bit of a waste of a plane fare', and
then he gets back to Sydney and every-
one wants them. They tell you every-
thing about the movement of stars. He
whirls through a complicated tour of
the Heavens, which Mrs. Whitcombe
listens to in weary silence. Stars, she
says, leave her cold. They are either
in the blood or not, and they’re not in
hers. It is extraordinary, though, whose
corpuscles they are in. There was the
Merchant Navy captain grinding a 6in.
mirror at sea, then working up to an
Bin., and now he’s on to a Maksutov,
which is very special and named after
a Russian who discovered it. There
was Mr. Funnel, who must be way past
65 now, grinding a 12in. one, and a
professor in Melbourne who’s ground
the entire range.
Enough of personalities. Eric Whit-

WAITING FOR THE NEW PRESIDENT
Comment by ‘Observer’
THE IDEA that some great revelation
about American policy in South-East
Asia will burst on us next week when
we know the name of the new American
President is, to say the least, naive.
To recognise that this belief is probably
held by the Prime Minister of Australia
is not to deny its naivety.
For the obvious reason that in these
matters they are not nitwits, both
candidates have left themselves open to
almost any possibility in South-East
Asian policy. They have been helped
in this by the fact that the really
emotional pulls in the election have
turned out to be domestic. It is true
that Mr. Nixon—in repeating a fort-
night ago what had already appeared
in an article by him published in The
Bulletin a year ago—bent a bit lower
in posture than Mr. Humphrey when
he warned the people of the area that
they would have to do more for them-
selves and look less to America. But
such statements do not necessarily mean
anything. In the 1964 election cam-
paign, President Johnson was safely
below Senator Goldwater on the
escalator but once he got back in, so
far as Vietnam policy was concerned,
he moved somewhat higher on the
escalator than Senator Goldwater. The
policies of the new President will be
first enacted amid the events of 1969,
and we don’t yet know what those
events will be, nor what political
expediencies they will offer.
However, there are certain obvious
drifts in mood and style in American
thinking that provide a kind of politi-
cally neutral substance that is likely
to make up the stuff out of which the
new President (whether his name is
Nixon or Humphrey) will fashion policy
—unless the drift of events provides
him with some quite different material.
Assuming that present drifts continue,
the new President will wish —with some
degree of sincerity—to “de-Americanise”
the war in Vietnam. The Americans
barged into Vietnam with such confi-
dence in their own material superiority
that they pinned their prestige to quick
success. Looking back on it, this was
crazy. Quick success was impossible. To
have promised it was to have produced
the very crisis in the American imagina-
tion that broke President Johnson’s
back. The Americans are not good
losers or even good at winning slowly.
They have no history of it to sustain
them. Many of the hearts that bled
for Vietnam really bled for a lack of
quick and familiar American victory.
The whole American approach now
is likely to adhere to an effort to become
less prominent in the war: to be less
stingy in subsidising the Vietnamese
Army, to be less arrogant in attitudes
toward it, and to let them take more
of the strain, although keeping great
numbers of American troops around
(after sending a few home). By this
means the Americans would give them-
selves the opportunity either to continue
or to fade out. It was pinning American
prestige to the idea of quick victory
that put the Americans ip an impossible
position. The next President is likely
to give himself some choices. Of these
a quick scuttle is not likely. A President
who marched an obviously defeated
army out of Vietnam would be im-
peached. The catchphrase now is that
the State Department would like things
to “fuzz over” in Vietnam. For those
who support the Americans in Vietnam
this could be good news.
For the future the critical question
is American policy in Thailand, and
here the optimum American position (if
things go on as they are) is likely to be
a promise of the present kind of
indirect support which might be all
that the Thais expect anyway—except
in the case of clear and obvious external
aggression. There is little prospect that
America would welsh on its present
commitments to Thailand (which are
not as open as the commitments are to
Vietnam). America is going to go on
playing a role in the world, and it can
do this only if its have
some meaning. What is happening is
not an American withdrawal from the
world but an attempt to be more care-
ful in commitment. Americans are
beginning to realise that they are not
God Almighty.
What all this should mean to Aus-
tralia is not a situation of panic nor a
situation of complacency but a situation
in which there should be time to adjust
to a South-East Asia in which America
can be less taken for granted. To a good
Australian political leader this should
seem an invigorating challenge. There
is an opportunity for Australia to play
a more independent role not only an
opportunity, but a necessity. The time
when we could simply sponge on
America has gone. We should now be
trying to make ourselves something of
an example in both self-reliance and
regional co-operation. If it is true that
the best that some members of the
Australian Government can do is think
of scuttling back to fortless Australia,
from which they would then flap their
copies of the Anzus Treaty, then God
help us America wouldn’t. Who
would help a gutless wonder?
CONFLICT WITH PARTY MYTHOLOGY
Comment by Alan Reid
IF THEY COULD sing, Messrs. John
Gorton, John McEwen, and Gough
Whitlam could harmonise magnificently
on the theme “Eve got troubles, lots and
lots of trouble.”
. It is not unusual for a political party
to have troubles. But it is fairly rare
for Australia’s three major political
parties to have troubles simultaneously,
which is the position today. The Liberal,
Labor, and Country Parties are all
having internal difficulties.
John Gorton, as Prime Minister and
Leader of the Liberal Party, is paying
the price within his Party of too much
honesty. He is a centralist. He accepts
the principle that in a modern state
the central Government must carry the
responsibility for the overall economic
welfare of the nation. It must, in his
view, control the machinery through
which full employment is maintained,
national development furthered on a
national rather than a State basis,
defence provided, inflation kept in
check, and gaps in State capacities
reinforced by Federal action.
Gorton’s predecessors as Prime Minis-
ter and Liberal Leader, Sir Robert
Menzies and the late Harold Holt, also
accepted these principles. They, like Mr.
Gorton, insisted upon maintaining
uniform taxation. It was during their
regimes that the tax reimbursement
formula against which the States are
now protesting was evolved. Their
strength, however, was that they
centralised without talking about what
they were doing. Mr. Gorton is con-
tinuing their centralist control but is
explaining what he is doing. His
honesty has added a new element to
the Commonwealth-States struggle,
Whereas under Menzies and Holt the
Premiers such as Rob Askin (N.S.W.)
and Sir Henry Bolte (Vic.) could not
raise the squabble above the vulgar level
of a scramble for more dollars, Mr.
Gorton’s statement of his attitude in
terms of theory has brought him into
conflict with Liberal Party mythology,
This mythology is that State’s rights
and a persistent opposition to Federal
encroachment upon areas of State
responsibility create a barrier to the
Socialism that a future Labor Left-wing
administration will seek to enforce upon
Australia once Labor reaches power,
So far, Mr. Gorton has not intruded
into the State domain as much as his
predecessors did. It was Menzies who
virtually took over the universities from
the States with the Universities Com-
mission. Mr. Gorton has merely
reiterated in more precise terms than
either Menzies or Holt why he is
determined to preserve taxing powers
for the Commonwealth. Menzies and
Holt did not explain the why. They
merely hung on to the taxing powers on

the score that it was impossible to
restore them to the States.
The emotional content for the
Liberals of the Commonwealth-State
struggle should not be underestimated.
It has the potential to split the Liberal
Party. It is as inflammatory for many
Liberals as State aid used to be for the
Labor Party.
The issue has already been carried
to a point where Premiers Askin and
Bolte are clearly indifferent to the
electoral trouble they could cause the
centralist Gorton. They have become
more of an effective opposition to the
Liberal-Country Party Government in
Canberra than the Federal Parliamen-
tary Labor Party has been for quite a
long time.
An interesting aspect is that while
a majority of Federal Liberal
parliamentarians seem to go along with
Mr. Gorton’s view, they are worried
because they are under fire in their
branches from the Askin and Bolte
supporters in N.S.W- and Victoria and
from the State righters in the other
States
Jeff Bate, the N.S.W. Liberal who
has made himself the spearhead of the
State righters in the joint Government
Parties room, attributes this to the “Can-
berra disease,” which turns even fervent
State righters into Commonwealth men
once they have spent a sufficient period
in what he considers the rarefied atmos-
phere of the National Parliament. But
I think he is doing them less than
justice.
Mr. Gorton is not alone in having
troubles. So has John McEwen in his
role as leader of the Country Party.
For the first time for many years, the
solidarity of the Country Party was
broken when Country Party whip Win-
ton Turnbull and Bob King, CP, Vic.,
voted with Labor on the wheat stabilisa-
tion legislation, while Western Aus-
tralian Don Maisey, CP, MHR,
refrained from voting after bitterly
attacking the wheat proposals. Turnbull,
Maisey, and King were the only ones to
show their uneasiness publicly. But there
are more than these three within the
Country Party wondering where the
Party is going, and the issue is much
more fundamental than wheat.
If the inefficient sections of the
primary-producing industries are going
to have the fine tooth comb put through
them, these malcontents cannot see why
the same treatment is not accorded to
inefficient secondary industries whose
inflated tariff protection adds to the
costs of primary products which are
essential to the maintenance of Aus-
tralia’s external currency earnings, but
which have to compete on world
markets. This issue is fundamental for
the Country Party.
Labor’s internal troubles are long
standing and unceasing. Mr. Whitlam’s
troubles are that most of his followers
are very able professional politicians.
Labor’s troubles have reached the stage
in which this quite considerable political
know-how is now being used not against
Labor’s official opponents but internally
against each other.


AUSTRALIA
John Gorton came out fighting
the wrong people
“HE’S A GREAT fighter, our John
Gorton, and I admire him for his guts.
The only trouble is, he’s fighting the
wrong people.” So spoke a prominent
Liberal parliamentarian last week, com-
menting on his Leader’s latest perform-
ance.
He was referring to the Prime
Minister’s vigorous assault, first on the
Democratic Labor Party and now on
the State branches of the Liberal Party.
No one knows quite how serious Vic-
torian Premier Bolte really was, but he
said early in the week that he would
rather have Mr. Whitlam as Prime
Minister than the present incumbent.
And it is now a DLP copy line that
Mr. Gorton is adopting the foreign
policies of Dr. Cairns.
These sorts of comments may look
extreme expressions of opinion simply
not justified by the facts of what Mr.
Gorton is actually doing. But they are
symptomatic of deep-seated and grow-
ing unease among Government sup-
porters at the behaviour of the Prime
Minister.
It is not really surprising that there
is disquiet. Some of it is, of course,
due simply to the fact that in key areas
of Government policy Mr. Gorton is
announcing radical changes. Some of it
is simple conservatism. But most of it
is due more to his manner of announc-
ing changed policy, rather than to the
changes themselves.
Take his handling of Federal-State
relations. Concern amo n g State
branches of the Liberal Party at Mr.
Gorton’s attitudes developed when, after
the Premiers’ Conference in June, he
went far beyond traditional Federal
financial meanness and said that in
future State Governments could only
impose new taxes if the proposal was
first cleared with his Government. He
simply abolished the term Common-
wealth Government and started to call
his show the “Australian Government”
as if by a semantic switch he could
sweep away the Constitution which pi'O-
vides for seven Australian Governments.
However, the State branches of the
Liberal Party were able to swallow this.
They were going to try to sort things
out at their annual Federal Council
meeting when they came together in
Canberra last week. They hoped that
Mr. Gorton would play things cool until
then, and let them gently and privately
remind him of the Party’s views.
But what did he do? A week before
the Council meeting he went out on a
speaking tour and at each of his stops
he made Federal-State relations a prin-
cipal topic. Seeming to want to put the
Federal Council of his Party in a
corner, he tried to get maximum pub-
licity for an extreme centralist case.
He was left of Opposition Leader
Whitlam. He did not put a
Whitlamesque case for the transfer of
specific functions to the Commonwealth
Government. He spoke in a much more
sweeping manner than that. In speeches
first at Mornington, Victoria, and then
at Terrigal, N.S.W., he laid down his
line. Since he always speaks off the cuff,
and at considerable length, around the
topic he is tackling, it is impossible to
simply quote him verbatim. But at
Mornington his emphasis was on the
setting of policy “goals” by a central
government for the people of all States
so that uniform standards of education,
health, transport, and other government
services would be provided. But, he
continued, he didn’t want centralism:
“Rather, the goal having been set (by
the central Government), the achieve-
ment of the goal is left to those
governments closer to the people than
is the central Government.” His denial
of centralist aims, in other words, con-
sisted of his intention to allow the
State Governments to continue to
remain as agencies to administer his
policies. At Terrigal, he spelt this out.
Priorities and policies would be his
business, but “the administration of
all these (Government) matters should
remain in governments closer to the
people than any government in
Canberra can be.”
The immediate reaction was one of
wonderment: Is this man serious?
Delegates to the Federal Council of the
Liberal Party were thinking that if Mr.
Gorton envisaged mere administration
as a State matter, with policy formula-
tion being a Commonwealth (no,
“Australian”) Government function,
the.n the State Governments might as
well pack up. They employ public
servants to administer. And if Canberra
were to make policy and set priorities,
then why should they bother retaining
State Parliaments. As elaborate
ombudsmen?
Others complained bitterly about
the Prime Minister’s logic. If, on his
own estimate, State Governments were
“closer to the people” shouldn’t
priorities be set and policies formulated
by parliamentarians closer to the
people? “He admits Canberra is a
blasted ivory tower,” said one, “and
yet he has the cheek to want to lay
down the law from there.”
Some who had obviously read a book
on the theory or organisation com-
mented that policy formulation and
Prime Minister Gorton last week with
Liberal Party-president Pagan
administration should be integrated in
the one government. Even the found-
ing fathers in their simple 19th century
wisdom, appreciated that the central
Government should make policy and
administer it in some areas, and the
State Governments make policy and
administer that in other areas. They
sensibly didn’t want to separate
policy-making from administration.
They wanted them as close as possible.
The whole principle of ministerial
responsibility, it is being pointed out,
is based on appreciation of the fact
that it is often difficult in the
practical world to draw a distinction
between bureaucratic-type administra-
tion and the making of policy. To try
to minimise rule by faceless
bureaucratic administrators, you try, in
form at least, to lump administration
and policy-making together as the
responsibility of the one man: the
Minister. And shouldn’t policy-making
be a continual two-way process,
administrative practice and experience
giving rise to policy reconsideration
and change? As well as the other way
about?
The Liberals didn’t like what Mr.
Gorton was saying. When he enter-
tained members of the Council at the
Lodge on Sunday night, he was told
he would be publicly rebuked by the
highest organ of the Party unless he
made concessions. He declared his
intention to stand firm: “They can go
to blazes,” he was quoted as saying to
a colleague.
But at a sober hour the next morn-
ing, as the Council was due to begin,
he was taken aside by Federal presi-
dent Jock Pagan, and the two engaged
in fervent private conversation, taken


by members of the Council to relate
to the controversial topic of
Federalism. Whether this is so or not,
soon afterwards he made his con-
cession, agreeing to a special con-
ference of the Party to discuss the
subject. N.S.W. Premier Askin wanted
assurances that it would be convened
reasonably soon. Mr. Gorton refused
to be committed, and it won’t be held
before March which is getting to-
ward election-time, they immediately
realised, when internal Party brawling
won’t help the image ‘with voters. “If
we aren’t careful, people will start
thinking we’re the Labor Party,”
commented one State politician.
Meanwhile, increasing numbers of
Liberals are worrying about Mr.
Gorton’s approach to defence policy.
Federal president Pagan said, in opening
the Council meeting, that (past) state-
ments on foreign affairs and appreciation
of Australia’s role in the Pacific
contributed largely to the appeal
coalition governments had to the
electors on a number of occasions. He
hoped the Party would never
“equivocate” on foreign policy, no
matter how difficult the problems might
be.
Unfortunately, the Government was
continuing to equivocate. The Cabinet
has still not started its Consideration of
the strategic review, and with External
Affairs Minister Hasluck having just
left Australia again, discussion has to be
further deferred. Meanwhile, there is
criticism of Mr. Gorton for pre-judging
the outcome of the strategic review by
the familiar technique of getting him-
self publicly committed first. He has
done this by repeated references to
continental defence.
In his speeches at Terrigal and the
Canberra Federal Council, Mr. Gorton
said the actual amount of money spent
on defence would probably rise but not
the proportion of GNP. This is an
adoption of a rigid Treasury view, which
he specifically rejected soon after be-
coming Prime Minister. “I wouldn’t
want to pin myself to any particular
percentage of GNP,” he said at a Press
conference on January 17. “I hate the
thought of all those resources devoted
to defence,” the PM commented in the
Federal Council address.
This commitment to the present
proportion of resources for defence came
at the very time that Mr. Richard
Nixon was saying, more strongly than
ever, that countries which wanted the
benefit of protection under an American
alliance would have to pull their weight
and do more for regional defence.
This remains the strong view of
Defence Minister Fairhall, and once
again last week he spoke out. At a
meeting of the Canberra branch of the
Liberal Party, after the endorsement of
an ex-Vietnam army captain, Robert
Maher, as Liberal candidate for the
A.C.T., Mr. Fairhall put a very strong,
almost emotional, case for an enlarged
defence effort by Australia and a more
active role in South-East Asia. It would,
he said, be "madness” for Australia to
pull back to a mainland fortress.
THE ORD
THE END?
IT IS QUITE on the cards that the
Commonwealth Government will again
decide to defer work on the $5O million
dam at the Ord. Several senior minis-
ters are believed to be urging this -
including the Minister for Primary
Industry! Mr. Anthony.
They believe that developments on
the small first stage are so poor that
the expensive expansion of the scheme
could be catastrophic. The Western
Australian Government (which is super-
vising the work) is in the process of
considering tenders and contracts which
could be let by the end of the year, so
there is a degree of urgency on the
question.
It was only the election of 1966
which induced the Commonwealth to
give the project the green light, and
this was done over the strenuous
opposition of many in Canberra. This
opposition can be represented as a
prejudice against the north, as lack ol
Imagination, and the like. But it isn’t.
It is scepticism about whether the Ord
can ever pay. Its proposed crop
cotton - ranks with sugar and dairy-
ing as having the most dismal market
prospects. And what is now recognised
is that the Ord is just not a sensible
place to grow cotton, even if cotton
must be grown. There isn’t a strain of
cotton really suited to the unusual
climate of the Ord; despite years of
plant breeding pests are a terrible
problem; because of its remoteness,
every item of equipment is more expen-
sive; and to maintain a living standard
comparable to the rest of Australia
much larger cash income is required.
Now the experience of four years on
the first stage of 30 farms has proved
the correctness of Bureau of Agricul-
tural Economics and Treasury estimates.
“A survey of farmers made in the past
few days shows that the situation looks
hopeless for nearly all of us,” said the
president of the Ord Growers’ Associa-
tion, Mr. K. Coster, a couple of weeks
ago. They were going increasingly
deep into debt through losses, and only
four farmers have said they will plant
a cotton crop this year. Some of the
others have actually abandoned their
farms to take outside work.
Half of this year’s crop of cotton at
the Ord is of too poor a quality for
use by Australian spinners and they
have declined to buy it. In any case,
they clearly prefer to deal with growers
AFTER AUSTRALIA'S FIRST HEART TRANSPLANT
Surgeon Windsor’s Press conference ... a mopping-up formality
PROBABLY THE world’s 64th human
heart transplant operation, and Aus-
tralia’s first, took place at St. Vincent’s
Hospital, Sydney, during the afternoon
and evening of October 23, some 300
days after Dr. Barnard’s epochal surgery
in Cape Town. As the operations had
become so numerous, St. Vincent’s
hoped to handle the news with
decorum, withholding the name of the
donor so that his widow might escape
sensational publicity. The plan was for
the leader of the surgical team, Dr.
Harry Windsor, to attend a Press con-
ference next day and answer questions
about the operation. But these proved
merely fond hopes. By the time of the
conference (above, Dr. Windsor is
second from the left) all that could be
discovered and published had been,
throughout Australia, and the talk was
a mopping-up formality.


close by on the Namoi, the Murrum-
bidgee, and in Queensland.
According to the Bureau of Agricul-
tural Economics’ survey, only three or
four farmers on the Ord have been
making good profits over the four years
of the scheme, most have only been
covering cash costs, and very few have
been covering depreciation which on
expensive machinery is a considerable
item.
Because of their distance from any
market, the Ord River farmers get less
for their crop at the farmgate than
others, and a great part of their cash
income has consisted of Commonwealth
Government bounty. From 10c a lb.,
this had declined to 7c this year, as
the acreage has risen and it is due
to be phased out completely over the
next three years.
The Bureau of Agricultural
Economics has produced some frighten-
ing figures showing what would happen
to Ord farmers without the bounty. On
the performance of the first three years,
they would be losing an average of
just over $lO,OOO each a year, although
they pay nothing toward the cost of
headworks and already get an array of
special assistance.
The second stage of the scheme is
intended to increase production of
cotton sixfold so that a bounty of the
present size of 7c a lb. would mean
an annual bill of $lO million. But, of
course, there is no guarantee that even
this will solve the Ord farmers’ prob-
lems. The trend of cotton prices is
down, the trend of cotton costs is up.
By 1974, the bill of subsidies to maintain
farmers there could easily be twice as
high.
Sorghum could one day replace
cotton as a staple for the region, but it
isn’t yet -a real prospect. Crops so far
have been small and very varying results
have been achieved. The market is in
Japan, where the local beef industry
depends largely on imported stock-
feed. But the Government hopes to
have the Japanese Government reduce
its high levels of protection to its local
beef industry and allow expanded
imports of Australian beef. In that case
the market for Australian sorghum
would fall away. Already sorghum
prices are going down, fro,m around
$6O a ton last year to about $45 now.
When the Commonwealth agreed in
1966 to lend the W.A. Government $5O
million for the large dam, a clear part
of the deal was an undertaking that the
State Government would look after
any extra costs or problems. But already
it has breached that undertaking: last
Friday a letter arrived in Canberra from
W.A. Premier Brand asking for Com-
monwealth assistance in maintaining
the bounty for the Ord.
This may well be the end of the
Ord for the ti'me being. Only Develop-
ment Minister Fairbairn is a keen Ord
man. Country Party Leader McEwen
has always been dead against it, fear-
ing that it could be a terrible financial
graveyard.
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
SINGAPORE HANGINGS
IN CANBERRA there was dismay at
the hanging of the two Indonesian
terrorists by the Singapore Govern-
ment. There was unanimous feeling
that the death sentences should have
been conpnuted in the interests of
harmonious regional relations. The
Australian Government did not get
enough notice of the hangings to
organise itself to intervene diplomati-
cally, so it is claimed.
The affair is a definite black mark
against the Singapore Government in
the books of most Australians. Cer-
tainly, they did not buy the extreme
Indonesian argument that the men
were just prisoners of war who had
been acting under military orders,
since the crime was committed against
civilians and done in a deliberate,
clandestine manner. But for Australia
the old British legal rule which con-
demns soldiers in mufti to death while
protecting uniformed men from any
punishment is losing favor because of
Vietnam. There, a good proportion of
prisoners are terrorists like the two
Indonesians and most are simply
jailed. There is almost no death sen-
tence for terrorism in the war in which
Australia is currently involved.
As for the Indonesian marines, they
surely it is argued should have
been pardoned. Confrontation, thank
goodness, is three years finished now,
and it is not as though there is any
need to deter future acts of terrorism
on the same account. Confrontation
was best forgotten by a policy of
leniency toward its few remaining
actors.
But Australian diplomats have always
found Mr. Lee Kuan Yew’s Singapore
administration sticklers for face and
form, showing a stubbornness against
compromise, which is only accountable
in terms of a feeling of insecurity and
lack of confidence. In many of their
dealings with the Malaysians, the
Singapore Government has shown a
similar unfriendly refusal to accommo-
date, and much of the pressure for
“separation” is attributed to this.
No one in the Australian Govern-
ment doubts the efficiency, honesty, or
dedicated goodwill of Mr. Lee’s
Government, but they feel its great
weakness is its sterile legalism and its
self-righteous rigidity. In this, Singa-
pore is unique in the region. Most of
the governments of the area are pre-
pared to move under pressure rather
than regard it as an intolerable inter-
ference.
Indonesian attitudes toward the death
penalty are also demonstrably different
from those of Singapore. Mr. Lee’s
Government hangs with some of the
enthusiasm of the British last century,
even though lawlessness is not a major
problem. In Indonesia, however, there
is a terrible amount of individual
violence, but the judicial system is
lenient. A quite small number of those
actually involved in the Gestapu coup
attempt in September, 1965, have
actually been executed by the Indo-
nesian authorities.
Magnanimity on the part of the
authorities is respected in Indonesia as
a sign of greatness on the part of
leaders, ’ whereas in Singapore it is
apparently taken as a sign of weakness.
Mr. Lee removed himself from any
temptation in that direction last week
by setting off on a world tour.
The worsening of Singapore/
Indonesian relations coming on top of
the Sabah dispute between Malaysia
and the Philippines is being used by
isolationists in the Australian Govern-
ment as an argument for pulling out
of the region. It certainly makes
schemes for regional co-operation
like ASEAN look increasingly
flimsy. And yet there are other Aus-
tralians who argue that Australia must
expect this sort of volatility in the
rapidly changing societies of South-
East Asia.
In the case of both Sabah and the
hangings, governments have generally
contained the populist protest and
agitation which has arisen. On Sabah
the Philippines Government has largely
been swept along on a wave of chauvin-
istic nationalism, but it has not allowed
itself to be swept into war. After a
good deal of relatively harmless rallying
and noise the issue seems to be losing
strength.
The hangings understandably pro-
voked a great outburst in Djakarta,
but again the Indonesian Government
contained it. Foreign Minister Adam
Malik fought courageously to stop
the extremists gaining momentu,m.
The answer the regionalists in Can-
berra give to the retractionists who look
at this sort of trouble and say, “Let’s
get out of the way,” is simple; the
area’s potential for trouble is the very
reason Australia wants to be around,
so that it can exercise a stabilising,
moderating influence.
Prime Minister Lee in Tokyo last week


SOUTH AUSTRALIA
UPPER HOUSE CRISIS
THE PRESENT crisis in the South
Australian Liberal and Country League
Government arose when ten members of
the Government, including Premier Hall
and four Ministers, crossed the floor of
the House to vote for an Opposition
Bill which granted full voting rights
in Legislative Council elections to all
South Australians over 21. At an earlier
Party meeting, Mr. Hall had informed
LCL members that he was prepared
to stake his political future on his
democratic beliefs, no matter what his
Party’s views were on the matter.
The Legislative Council is at present
elected on general property-owning
head-of-family lines with a non-
compulsory enrolment and vote. These
electoral arrangements assure, short of
revolution or change of heart among the
Members, a permanent LCL majority
of 16 to a Labor Opposition of four. It
is an arrangement the ALP naturally
despises as being blatantly autocratic,
and it provides that Party with con-
siderable and damaging ammunition.
Mr. Hall, notwithstanding his honestly
expressed views on the matter, has
obviously also calculated that to support
the Council for reasons of Party
expediency would be more damaging
to the Party’s position in the Lower
House than angry Councillors would
be to his Leadership.
The Opposition Bill which was
presented by Leader Don Dunstan
simply proposed complete adult fran-
chise. In the second reading debate the
Premier accused Mr. Dunstan of
presenting the Bill merely to embarrass
him and those Members reported in a
Press leak from the LCL conference
earlier this year as having argued for
a change in the Party’s Council plat-
form.
He was probably quite right. He
continued by saying that he was not at
all embarrassed by the Bill and would
support it provided that the enrolling
and voting in Council elections
remained voluntary and that a binding
clause be inserted in the Bill making a
referendum necessary before any move
to abolish the Council could succeed.
He said he believed that with multiple
electorates, six-year ter'ms, and a volun-
tary universal franchise the Council
would be sufficiently different in com-
position to remain an effective House
of Review.
The following day Mr. Hall’s stand
received cold criticism from his Upper
House colleagues and the eight Mem-
bers who voted against the Bill in the
Lower House. Lands Minister Brook-
man said the Council cushioned the
community against the shock of sudden
change, and that he believed in “an
Upper House elected on a different
franchise that makes it naturally more
conservative.” Similar sentiments were
expressed by other opponents, with Mr.
Degaris, Chief Secretary and Leader
in the Upper House, holding icily that
“full adult franchise would reduce the
Legislative Council from an effective
House of Review to a straight Party
House controlled by the Assembly.”
Following these events, the Press
pushed the heart transplant to page
three, proclaimed “crisis” in banner
headlines, and gave prominence to Mr.
Dunstan’s statement that the Council
would be “signing its own death
warrant” if it did not accept the Bill.
A strained and aggressive Mr. Hall
replied, accusing him of showing “as
much diplomacy as the proverbial bull
in a china shop,” and of seriously
prejudicing the Bill’s chances of
success. But it is far more likely that
the Council will reject the Bill on the
grounds that the Party platform re-
quires them to do so.
Although he has shaken the faith of
the more right-thinking LCL Members,
Mr. Hall’s courage and idealism has
undoubtedly strengthened his popularity
at large considerably, and, assuming
that the Bill will be rejected by the
Council, he will speak from a position
of considerable prestige when the issue
is forced at the next LCL State con-
ference.
In the meantime his opponents are
expected to press for his censure by
the bi-monthly LCL State Council.
Asked what the Council’s action is
likely to be, its president, Mr. H. C.
Morphett, said he had no idea because
“this sort of thing has never happened
before.” Mr. Hall’s strength lies with
the Ministers and senior Party Members
who support him in his stand, and
disciplinary action by the Party machine
could precipitate a disastrous split in
the whole Party.
VICE-REGAL
END OF A TRADITION
THERE IS TOLD in Adelaide an
impeccably authenticated story of the
aged social lioness of the ’forties who,
on the lawns of Government Llouse,
supported by the city’s most well-bred
social cubs, refused to be presented
to “that man” Sir William McKell,
the second Australian-born Governor-
General, in whose introductory honor
the day’s garden party had been given.
To observers of the scene, it appeared
that South Australia’s political society
would never countenance an Australian
Governor, and so the announcement last
week that Major-General Sir James
William Harrison, presently GOC
Eastern Command, Sydney, had been
appointed to the post is another indica-
tion of just how radically and realistic-
ally that State’s social and political
values are changing.
The question of a new Governor has
been a matter of conjecture for over a
year. Since Buckingham Palace decides
such matters well in advance, the latter
days of the Dunstan Government saw
a variety of rumors appear about the
identity of the new Governor, ranging
from the then Speaker of the House of
Sir James Harrison ... direct
descendant
Assembly, Mr. Riches, through to a
South Australian scientist of wide
renown, who, it was argued, would give
intellectual distinction to the post.
What does seem certain is that the
Dunstan Government intended to
recommend an Australian civilian, and
that the imminence of an election did
not allow a final decision. The Hall
Government has now preferred to
recommend a distinguished Australian
soldier. Now that the tradition of
British Governors has been broken, it
is unlikely that they will ever return to
South Australia. The Adelaide “Adver-
tiser,” in noting that most South Aus-
tralians had been hoping for an Aus-
tralian appointment, set its seal on the
whole matter by sombrely pointing out
the precedents set in other States, and
remarking that citizens would be able
to welcome Sir James and Lady Harri-
son to South Australia as “direct descen-
dants of Captain John Hindmarsh of
HMS Buffalo.”
SCIENTOLOGY
N.S.W.'s SECOND THOUGHT
NEW SOUTH WALES, Western
Australia, South Australia, and New
Zealand are now catching up with
Victoria in the investigation of the
international cult of scientology. Last
week the New South Wales Govern-
ment instructed its Director of Psychi-
atric Services to investigate. This follows
an earlier decision to ignore it as
comparatively harmless. The change
in policy follows the raising of a
privilege issue when Mr. R. O. Healey,
a Liberal Member of the Legislative
Assembly, read a statutory declaration
of a private inquiry agent employed by
the “Church of Scientology” to collect
information on Mr. Healey and several
other Members of the Legislative
Assembly and Legislative Council. The

Speaker, Mr. Ellis, ruled that since no
actual intimidation had been attempted,
no question of privilege was involved.
The Minister for Health, Mr. Jago, later
announced the new inquiry.
Meanwhile, Mr. Martin Bentley of
the “Church of Scientology” has written
to all Members of the Legislative
Assembly (including the ones being
investigated) stating: “We find that any-
one who attacks us for crimes or anti-
social acts is misinformed” (sic). Of the
private inquiry agent, Mr. Bentley said:
“He has disappeared. Convenient, isn’t
it? He is not around to answer up to
his lies. Well, the law will deal with
him.” Members also received a book
called “Kangaroo Court” denouncing
the Victorian inquiry into scientology
as worthy of a State founded by
criminals, organised by criminals, and
devoted to making people criminals. It
described Victoria as a legacy of “the
riff - raff of London slums, robbers,
murderers, prostitutes, thieves the
scourings of Newgate and Bedlam.”
The situation is complicated now by
Scientology’s claim to be a church
entitled to religious freedom. Some
critics of scientology accept this claim
and regard it as no worse than other
insidious sects. Others, however, allege
that scientology turns people into
zombies and claim that such a “religion”
is not entitled to freedom of worship.
The lesson of all these inquiries
should be clear to Queensland. Queens-
land is the only mainland State in which
scientology does not operate. If scien-
tology is to one degree or another
suppressed in all mainland States as
well as New Zealand, Queensland will
be the next centre of scientology
operations.
THE CHUROHES
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES
AN OBSERVER of the 1968 Synod
of the Melbourne Archdiocese of the
Church of England in Australia might
Be forgiven for thinking that it reflected
more the Church established than the
Church militant. He would not have
been completely accurate. The Synod
did confront two contentious issues.
The first concerned abortion. A
motion was passed which requested the
Victorian Government to legalise
abortion in the restricted cases of rape,
incest, serious risk to the life or mental
health of the mother, substantial risk
of a seriously deformed child, or where
the woman’s consent to intercourse was
due to unsoundness of mind. In the
cases of risk to the mother or chance
of deformity, the opinion of two legally
qualified medical practitioners would
be required, as well as the active desire
of the woman.
How much pressure this resolution
would exert on Sir Henry Bolte’s
Cabinet and the councils of the Liberal
Party is not hard to imagine. At the
last State Council of the Party, a con-
fined resolution was passed which sought

the protection of doctors who procured
a miscarriage to save the life or health
of the woman. This proposal is cur-
rently being considered by the Parlia-
mentary Party.
Although the Synod motion was
passed by a substantial vote, the Arch-
bishop, Dr. Frank Woods, spoke deter-
minedly against extending the law,
beyond allowing abortion where there
were grave risks to the mother. The
Archbishop’s amendment was defeated,
but to any good politician who can
sense the tides and eddies of public
opinion Dr. Wood’s defeat was by no
means an effective one.
There are few crusading spirits
among the Parliamentary Liberal Party:
most will think only a small change
could be in any way justified.
The Synod’s second effort to tackle a
major issue of the day was involved in
a motion asking the Synod to agree in
principle to the practice known as AID
(artificial insemination donor). Maybe
it was not one of the great questions
of our time: certainly not as troubled
as the abortion issue, which is causing
some frenzy in Melbourne at present,
as it also is in States to the west.
The AID resolution may have been
in some ways a search for an issue,
but then popular belief holds that noth-
ing lies outside the concern of the
Church, however non-U or unsavory.
But Dr. Woods was not prepared to
take up the issue just for the sake
of espousing causes. On the third day
of the Synod he said he was embarrassed
by the motion and said he felt that
the governing council of the Church
would look ridiculous if it supported
the motion on AID. The matter was
reviewed by an English committee in
Dr. Woods ... embarrassed by headlines
1959, and he couldn’t see the need for
another.
The Synod, he felt, had also been
embarrassed by the headlines that
followed the motion on abortion. It
would appear that the Synod was
obsessed by sex. With concern for
appearances in the air, the AID motion
was lost. In a sense, Dr. Woods was
right. The paucity of other items of
wide import on the agenda did high-
light abortion and AID.
The Church militant did consider the
attitude of the Archdiocese to the
marriage of divorced Anglicans: a
resolution which “noted with interest
the formation of the Anglican Com-
mittee for Social Action and
commended its aims” was moved, the
Archdiocese’s attitude to State Aid was
reaffirmed, but the martial banners,
swords, and drums seemed out of sight.
THE WEST
NICKEL BONUS?
KALGOORLIE’S happy industrial at-
mosphere has had a backlash for nickel
miners at Western Mining Corporation’s
nickel town, Kambalda. Unions and
management work in traditional
harmony in the goldmining industry
because, without such co-operation,
marginal mines would soon have to
close. Little wonder if nickel miners,
trying for a future rather than benefiting
from a past, sometimes feel , their union
organisers are riding the wrong horse.
This has been a factor behind the mass
meeting of 400 men who decided to
close down Kambalda last week the
second such dispute in a month.
Kambalda unionists had been working
under a bonus scheme framed for the
goldmining industry. When they found
their packets getting thinner in line
with a formula pegged to award in-
creases and whittling down over-award
payments, they took direct action
without their union’s prompting. They
agreed, following a strike early in
October, to accept $l2 a week as an
interim measure but set an October
18 deadline for Western Mining to meet
their claim for a $3O bonus.
“Once we have the company’s offer,
we will negotiate with them on this,”
their spokesman said. “I feel that the
nickel bonus will wipe out all the side
issues causing unrest at the moment.”
However, when the men called upon
the Employers’ Federation to respond,
they were told the Federation dealt only
with unions. Similarly the dispute did
not go immediately to the Industrial
Commission, which deals with awards,
but not bonuses, and had not officially
been notified of the strike.
This was the first piece of poor
liaison. The second followed a hope,
after the term of an iron ore industry
award ended last February, that a
precedent would be set by hitching iron
ore workers’ pay packets to mining
industry prosperity, with nickel indus-
try workers following on.
But the iron ore award case did not
finally get to court until last Monday,
and then in a revised form. There is no
specific claim for a stipulated bonus,
simply an effort to establish the principle
that prosperous mining companies
should pay their workers more than the
award. Eventually this could be expected
to rebound into Kambalda, but mean-
while men there are waffling around in
a dispute that is particularly messy
largely because strike experience around
Kalgoorlie is so limited.

November 5- when the
guessing has to stop
Richard Nixon and the Nixonettes ... the signs are
with him
Hubert Humphrey campaigning in Los Angeles last week —
AAP-AP photo
A scuffle between pro- and anti-Wallace
listeners AAP-AP photo
IF MR. HUBERT HUMPHREY were
to be elected 37th President of the
United States and de facto leader
of the free world on November 5,
much of the credit would go to the
North Vietnamese and the Russians.
For all present signs suggest that the
Republican nominee, Mr. Richard
Nixon, can hardly fail to win unless
some new element is injected into the
campaign in its last days. If the talks
on the Vietnamese War which have
been dragging on in Paris were sud-
denly transformed into genuine peace
negotiations, this would, indeed, be such
a new clement. How big a one is any-
body’s guess.
Certainly some, if not most, of the
pacifists and dissident Democrats who
have contracted out of the Presidential
campaign because of their distress over
the war would come back to Mr.
Humphrey. Mr. Nixon would argue
promptly that peace negotiations were
too important to be left to discredited
Democrats who had mishandled the
war. But a new development of such
importance, even though it had been
expected, as this one has been, would
shake his well-organised campaign, now
climbing to a carefully planned peak.
Already Mr. Nixon himself has been
losing some of his calm detachment,
as Mr. Humphrey’s share in the public-
opinion polls has begun to go up and
as Mr. Plumphrey has begun to arouse
more enthusiasm and attract more
support.
Whether, in fact, one thinks that Mr.
Humphrey has any real chance of win-
ning depends on whether one follows
Dr. Gallup, who in his penultimate sur-
vey issued last week has Mr. Nixon still
12 points ahead, or Mr. Louis Idarris,
who gives him an advantage of only
five points, almost within the accepted
margin of error of these surveys. The
pollsters themselves saying that any-
thing may happen this year are wor-
ried about the wide divergence between
their estimates. These may be going
awry because of the entry in this year’s
race of a serious third party candidate,
so'mething for which allowance has not
had to be made in the past. Mr. George
Wallace, running as the nominee of his
own reactionary American Independent
Party, may be responsible for a more
dangerous interference with the normal
mechanics of a Presidential election. If
he really gets 20 percent or more of the
vote, he could prevent either of the
major candidates from having the
majority 270 votes which is
required in the electoral college where
the President is actually chosen. This
could mean weeks, or even 'months, of
uncertainty about who is to be the next
incumbent of the White House.
The election campaign has been re-
markable for its air of disengagement
and unreality. The war in Vietnam has
not been discussed in detail by any of
the Presidential nominees. The danger
that the Paris negotiations might be
made even more difficult has provided
a good excuse. All the candidates
promise to end the war, but the only
one who says he knows how to do it is
General Curtis LeMay, Mr. Wallace’s
vice-president nominee, who would
apply his world war recipe of saturation
bombing to North Vietnam. Today
there are surprisingly few Americans
-- they do not include Mr. Wallace
himself who accept this recipe.
Another topic which Mr. Nixon and
Mr. Humphrey find almost as embar-
rassing, although it is Mr. Wallace’s
stock in trade, and which is of even
more concern than the war to most
voters, is the co.mplex of crime in the
streets and violence in the cities the
so-called issue of “law and order,” a
phrase full of racist undertones. Between
them, the war in Vietnam and this
other war at home have split completely
apart the old coalition on which the
Democratic majority has been based for
more than 30 years. Together they
explain why the Republicans con-
fidently expect to win the election.
The refusal of Senator McCarthy,
and of those who supported his protest
against the Administration’s policy in
Vietnam, to accept the Democratic con-
vention’s nomination of Mr. Humphrey
has cost him the ca,mpaign help of
many of the dedicated party workers
who can usually be relied on to collect
the money and get out the vote. Few
of the young and the sophisticated, the
Democrats of the Left, have been
working under Mr. Humphrey’s banner.
On the Right is another group of
normally reliable Democratic Party
people, the trade unionists and blue-
collar workers. But their resentment
against the Negroes and the protesters
draws many of them to Mr. Wallace,
whose main constituency is the con-
servative, and once solidly Democratic,
South. So Mr. Humphrey is left with
the Party machine, very rusty, the
Party bosses, very decayed, the poor,
not very numerous after years of pros-
perity, the Negroes, supporting him
because they have nowhere else to go,
and an uncertain, but not negligible,
nu'mber of devoted Democrats, includ-
ing Labor leaders, who remain faithful


to President Johnson and his chosen
successor.
When election day arrives, the ties of
loyalty and the weaknesses of the
alternative candidates will certainly
pull many, maybe a great many, of the
wandering Democrats back, just as they
did in 1948 when President Truman
defeated the Republican Governor
Dewey with such dramatic unexpected-
ness. But the collapse of the Democratic
coalition looks much more complete
now than it did 20 years ago. Social
and economic developments have eaten
away its foundations. In spite of the
publicity given to the protests of the
young, opinion as a whole is becoming
more conservative. The extension of the
Federal Government’s power into local
affairs is especially resented and the
Republicans gain from this. The poli-
tical centre seems to have moved signifi-
cantly to the Right. If Mr. Nixon wins,
and wins handsomely, he may be able
to build a new and lasting coalition
around it for his party.
If Mr. Humphrey wins, he would
almost certainly be a minority Presi-
dent. Mr. Nixon might well be one, too.
This means that the next President,
whoever he is, may be tempted to give
too much attention to strengthening his
own position, or ensuring his own re-
election, rather than concentrating on
bringing some unity and purpose to his
disgruntled and recalcitrant country.
Both candidates know that this urgently
needs to be done. But in the campaign
neither has shown the inspiration and
leadership that is required to do it.
VIETNAM
THE DOOR'S OPEN
AGREEMENT ON how both the
Saigon Government and the National
Liberation Front can be fitted into the
second stage of the Paris peace talks is
now widely seen as the last outstanding
obstacle in the way of the United
States announcing a total bombing
halt in Vietnam.
U.S. administration officials are
clearly irritated by Prince Souvanna
Phouma’s statement in Laos last week
that he had been told by the American
Ambassador in Vientiane that the
decision had already been taken in
favor of stopping the bombing. But
they have made no effort to rebut the
Laotian Premier’s statement.
Mystification over what exactly is
going on between Washington and
Hanoi has increased. There are several
interpretations of President Johnson’s
curiously unproductive Press conference
last Thursday. But the most persuasive
remains that which holds that the Presi-
dent (if only by what he did not say)
went out of his way to hold the door
open for further progress toward a
settlement of the war.
It is plainly this prospect that is now
alarming Mr. Nixon and which, some
believe, may even have been responsible
President Johnson reporting on the Vietnam peace talks last Thursday —UPI photo
for the first serious mistake of his cam-
paign. In a strangely unguarded state-
ment issued in New York last week he
appeared first to raise and then to fore-
close the possibility that “influential
elements both inside and outside the
Democratic Party” might not be above
trying to get “a fake peace” in Vietnam
in what he called at one point “a
cynical, last-minute effort to salvage Mr.
Humphrey’s candidacy.”
No sooner had the Republican candi-
date voiced his suspicions of what certain
pro-Humphrey forces in the Administra-
tion might be up to than Vice-President
Humphrey’s camapign manager, Mr.
Larry O’Brien, came back at him heavily
with the charge that “the real Nixon,
the one and only Nixon, has now finally
shed his Madison Avenue veneer.”
Mr. O’Brien, sighting in on Mr.
Nixon’s proclaimed belief that Mr.
Johnson was resisting the political
pressures on him, claimed to detect in
the Republican candidate’s statements
“the familiar Nixon of old, managing
by artful rhetoric to convey a vicious
and false accusation without taking
responsibility for his own words.”
As a campaign exercise there can
be little doubt that Mr. O’Brien had
the better of the exchange and
there were some signs that the Nixon
camp (already apprehensive of the
anticipated endorsement by Senator
McCarthy of Mr. Humphrey) had
begun to lick its self-inflicted wounds
on the Vietnam issue. Yet Mr. Nixon’s
suspicions, if indiscreetly expressed,
were probably not totally ill-founded.
A major debate is believed to have
gone on within the Johnson adminis-
tration about the proper stance it
should adopt toward North Vietnam’s
apparent decision to de-escalate the war
in the South.
Leading the group prepared to
accept Hanoi’s withdrawal of regular
troops as a de facto gesture toward
peace was Mr. Clark Clifford, the
Secretary of Defence, and above any-
one else the man responsible for
persuading President Johnson to halt
the 'bombing above the 19th parallel
last March. Opposing him, predict-
ably, was Dean Rusk, the Secretary
of State, over the past four years
the war’s greatest historical apologist
and popular propagandist.
It seems now, however, that this
debate has been resolved in favor of
regarding the continued lull in the
fighting (American casualties, in the
week before last, at a figure of 100,
were the lowest in 14 months of the
war) as Hanoi’s signal in favor of
peace.
Significantly, one administration
official commented that he could only
think that Mr. Nixon’s sudden decision
to raise the possibility of peace as a
campaign issue represented a rattled
attempt to cushion the political
consequences for his own candidacy
even of a more limited announcement
that the bombing had simply been
stopped.
SOUTH AFRICA
THE BRUTAL TRUTH
This week the Editor-in-Chief of the
Rand “Daily Mail,” Mr. Laurence
Gandar, is due to go on trial for printing
what he considered to be the truth about
prisons in South Africa. Here, a South
African lawyer, who has defended
opponents of the regime and has him-
self been in prison there, outlines the
background of the case.
THE BUSIEST HANGMAN in the
world is a South African. Half the
world’s judicial executions take place
in Pretoria Central Prison, where a
special gallows with multiple nooses is
used to hang an average of 100 people
every year.
As for corporal punishment, in the
past 15 years more than one million
strokes have been imposed on more
than 200,000 offenders (last year, nearly
600,000 new prisoners were received
into South African prisons, six time's
the figure for England and Wales, which
has more than twice the population of
South Africa).
That prisoners have been kicked fo
death, whipped, shot, and subjected to
electric-shock torture is not in issue,
because the courts have made such
findings in a number of cases. In 1964
there were 69 cases of policemen found
guilty of unlawful violence to persons


in their custody, the victims being 44
prisoners, 21 suspects, and four
witnesses.
The most notorious of these cases
concerned four white policemen at a
small village named Bultfontein, who,
in the course of investigating a minor
theft fro’m a shop, whipped an African
suspect, partially choked and suffocated
him by tying his head in a plastic bag,
threw him to the ground so that his
skull crashed violently on the floor, and
subjected him to electric shocks while
he was trussed in a sitting position. The
suspect was killed by this treatment,
and the station commander at the police
station where this happened tried to
hush the matter up. At the subsequent
trial one of the policemen said that
these methods of interrogation were
common throughout the country.
Was this police’man correct, or is the
Government right in its claim that only
a few “black sheep,” who are firmly
dealt with by their superiors, are re-
sponsible for brutality in police stations
and prisons? A few years ago, when the
judges were more easily shocked than
would seem to be the case today, a
senior judge was so angered by the
brutal killing of a convict that he
urged a full-scale judicial inquiry into
conditions in South African prisons be
held. This call was taken up by the
Rand “Daily Mail,” which in 1965
published three long reports in support
of it by a recently released political
prisoner, Harold Strachan. In vivid
narrative Strachan recounted innumer-
able cases he had witnessed.
The immediate response of the
security police was to place Strachan
under house arrest and to raid the
editorial offices of the “Mail.”
Three weeks later, however, South
Africa’s largest weekly, the “Sunday
Times,” carried a sensational story of
allegations by a head warder at a prison
named Cinderella, to the effect that
prisoners there were frequently sub-
jected to punishment by electric-shock
torture. The “Mail” subsequently re-
peated the story and amplified it with
corroborative statements by another
warder and two ex-convicts.
After carrying out a secret investi-
gation the Government decided to
prosecute not the persons allegedly re-
sponsible for brutality but the people
who had made the allegations.
The Prisons Act of 1959 contained a
provision new to South African law
making it a serious criminal offence
for anyone to publish any false in-
formation . . . concerning the adminis-
tration of any prison, knowing the same
to be false, or without taking reasonable
steps to verify such information, the
onus of proving that reasonable steps
were taken to verify such information
being upon the accused. .
One by one, Strachan, the head
warder and his colleague, and the two
ex-prisoners were convicted.
Next, the prosecution issued sum-
monses against the “Sunday Times” and
the “Mail,” against their editors, against
a journalist who had written some of
the stories, and against a solicitor who
had advised on whether to print them.
The “Sunday Times” printed a
cautious editorial retraction earlier this
year, and, later, the charges against it
and its editor were withdrawn. The
“Mail” has not, however, printed a
retraction, and the trial of its editor,
Laurence Gandar, and one of its poli-
tical reporters, Benjamin Pogrund, is
due to go ahead in the Supreme Court
this week. (The charge against the soli-
citor was dropped only last month.)
The indictment against Pogrund and
Gandar is more remarkable for what it
leaves out than for what it alleges. It
does not claim, for example, that elec-
tric shock torture was not used at Cin-
derella Prison: all it alleges on this
score is that it was false to say that the
head of the prison was present if and
when such shocks were being adminis-
tered. The reason for the narrow basis
for this part of the charge was that the
courts had already found that there was
a reasonable possibility, backed up by a
considerable body of evidence, that an
electro-therapy machine at the prison
had in fact been converted into an
instrument of torture.
This finding in itself would in a
civilised country be regarded as sufficient
justification for the articles. Not in
South Africa. In South Africa, cases
which in Australia could safely be left
to libel actions are brought before the
Criminal Courts.
One thing that does emerge clearly
from the three years of charge and
counter-charge is the courage and
tenacity first of Strachan and now of
Gandar and Pogrund. What remains to
be seen is what price these two news-
papermen have to pay for printing the
truth as they saw it and for daring to
go against the trend to glorify all things
South African or else keep quiet.
SINGAPORE-INDONESIA
ON GOES THE BOYCOTT
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
IN THE PRESENT crisis in relations
between Indonesia and Singapore over
the hanging in Singapore of two
Indonesian Confrontation saboteurs
now at a somewhat indeterminate stage
it is as well to remember that
Indonesian resentment of Singapore is
a 'mixture of geography and tradition,
nationalism and racialism. Singapore
has been not only Indonesia’s main trad-
ing link with the outside world but also
the main processing point for many
Indonesian exports. Acceptance of these
realities by the Indonesians has been
made no easier in the post-colonial era
both because of the nationalist desire
for economic self-reliance and the
racialist concomitant — 1 the desire to
end or at least limit the economic
domination of the economy by the
Chinese at home and, in Singapore’s
case, abroad.
Indonesia being Indonesia, the growth
Editor Candar ... dared to print the
truth
and expression of resentment has borne
little if any relation to the growth of
capacity to undercut the causes of
resentment. Singapore being Singapore
and the Chinese being the Chinese, too
little has been done to undercut the
resentment by making “domination”
more acceptable, though ironically the
present crisis comes at a time when at
last Singapore had shown some signs
of taking steps in this regard.
Ironically, too, the present crisis has
emerged at a time when by any rational
calculation one would have thought that
undercutting the position of Singapore
was nowhere near the top of Indonesia’s
list of political and economic priorities.
Foreign Minister Adam Malik has
steadily resisted calls for the breaking of
diplomatic and economic ties, but he
has cut a somewhat lonely figure in his
recognition of this necessity. “To be
self-sufficient in processing products and
to enable us to send processed goods to
consumer countries, bypassing Singa-
pore,” he says, “we have to have good
ports which we do not have at this
moment. Just to have such ports will
take years ... we should think of our
minimal ability.”
It would have been more encouraging
if this week he had been less lonely,
but from President Suharto downward
the stress was more on maximal hopes,
not minimal ability. The President
continued to talk of relations with
Singapore being reviewed and of
Indonesia becoming self-sufficient of
Singaporean processing. General Nasu-
tion termed the Singapore action of
hanging the two marines “more than
mere hostility,” and asserted that if
a matter concerned the national honor
there could not be any compromise.
Like many others, Nasution called for
swift and firm action in retaliation. So
far the main action has been for ships to
boycott Singapore and port workers in
Indonesia to boycott Singapore ships.
Even Trade Minister Sumitro has
reportedly called for a review of trade
relations, though he carefully added the
all-important rider that “the policy to


be pursued by the Government would
not be detrimental to Indonesia’s trade.”
Singapore’s gamble is, of course, that
Singapore is needed 'more than Singa-
pore needs, and so what is not detri-
jnental to Indonesia will still be advan-
tageous to Singapore. As a short-term
calculation this has been borne out in
that the Indonesians have acted more
cautiously than they have spoken. After
a Cabinet meeting on October 24 a
Government statement called for avoid-
ing of emotional acts that would destroy
the national interest. Adam Malik has
called for the ending of the boycotts.
But the Government statement also
noted that the Singapore action “in
executing two Indonesian national
heroes has awakened the Indonesian
people’s consciousness to speed up
efforts to improve the economic life
of the people.” Writes leading journalist
Mochtar Lubis: “If Indonesia wants,
to beat Singapore, the 'main thing is
to take steps to overcome our own
weaknesses.”
Thus, it was not merely last week’s
anti-Chinese demonstrations in Java and
Sumatra which cast doubt on the
wisdom of Singapore’s action in creating-
two national heroes for the Indonesians.
SABAH
OLD INCOMPATIBLES
WHILE IN SOME quarters it was
naively hoped that they would serve to
eliminate the incompatibles or at least
blunt the rougher edges, the projected
Razak-Ramos talks in Tokyo never took
place because the incompatibles found
further expression. As briefly reported
last week, in the very week preceding
the meeting when the Malaysian
Parliament was in special session to dis-
cuss and reject the Sabah claim and the
recent Philippine Bill asserting
sovereignty, Philippine Foreign Sec-
retary Ramos rejected Malaysia’s power,
competence, or authority to represent or
speak for the people of the territory
of Sabah. Not only that but he had
earlier assured the Malaysian UN
Ambassador that this rejection would
be deleted from his speech. It wasn’t,
and so, naturally, the very least that
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Tun
Razak could do in the face of much
parliamentary pressure not to hold the
talks was to stress that he was speaking
and representing Malaysia, including
Sabah.
This left the Filipinos boxed in by
their own manoeuvres, since the only
really satisfactory assurance for the
Malaysians would have been a with-
drawal of what Ramos said at the UN.
In point of fact, in his letter to the
Malaysian UN Ambassador seeking to
give assurance, Ramos only .made
matters worse, since he couched his
recognition of the territorial integrity of
Malaysia in terms that represented, in
Malaysian eyes, a marked escalation of
the reservations Manila had previously
put upon her recognition of Malaysia.
Last, but not least, there was the
ambiguous position of the Filipino diplo-
mats in Kuala Lumpur whose with-
drawal was announced in a note on
July 20. Although the Malaysian diplo-
mats in Manila have already with-
drawn, leaving behind only an adminis-
trative officer, the Filipinos have failed
to withdraw. Now the Malaysians
withdrawn their diplomatic status,
though Prime Minister Tunku Abdul
Rahman has made it quite clear that,
the Filipino diplomats can stay on as
long as they like without it.
Against such a background, it would
seem just as well that the projected
talks did not take place. As always,
there is no compromise in sight
between the realities of the status quo
and the exigencies of Philippine
politics. This being so, the failure of
the talks would only have produced
more acrimony. As the Tunku put
it this week: “They would probably
have made things worse, and I think
the best way is to keep quiet and let
things lie down.”
Easier said than done, of course, as,
if the past few months are anything
to go by, the Filipinos will do their
very considerable best to speak or act
in a manner which Malaysian self-
respect will find it impossible to ignore.
However, since the issue has probably
peaked too soon from the point of
view of the next Philippine general
election, it could just be that in the
next few weeks at least there will be
a cooling-off of sorts. But the under-
lying heat remains, which is why this
week Defence Minister Tun Razak
went to Sabah to oversee defence
preparedness. That he should have
to do this is as good an index as
any as to how far and how fast
Malaysia-Philippines relations have
degenerated in the past six or seven
months. Early last March, as I then
pointed out in The Bulletin, it seemed
that the worsening of the dispute and
its possible guerillarisation were
among the prospects for instability
after the British withdrawal. But, then,
in South-East Asia the ti,me-lag
between foresight and hindsight is
sometimes devastatingly slight.
Tun Razak’s main task in Sabah
is to see to it that the State’s long
coastline is well patrolled and the
strung-out population well protected
against the possibility of infiltrations.
But, with the Liberal opposition busy
attacking President Marcos for having
not handled this Asian problem in an
Asian way and the President asking
them to present their alternative, it
remains to be seen whether this par-
ticular Asian way of pushing disputes
will be seen to be in anyone’s electoral
or other interest.
Whatever happens, the Sabah claim
dispute looks like being here to stay.
Unless there is a sudden miraculous
imaginative initiative forthcoming it
would also appear far too late for
outside pressure to remove the incom-
patibles before they find even more
expression.
NEW ZEALAND
FOR SAFER SECURITY
CRITICS OF New Zealand’s Security
Service have waited for years for Par-
liament to scrutinise the extent and
quality of its operations.
Though 1968 was not marked by
any big flare-up over security agents
in universities which caused a com-
mission of inquiry to be set up in
1966 this year the Labor Opposition
responding to pressures from the anti-
Vietnam War protestors and its own
members, initiated a Parliamentary
debate in which they called for inform
mation about the numbers and salaries
of the members of the Security Service
and for a legislative basis for their
operations.
They were denied information about
numbers and salaries, but won a
grudging agreement from the Minister
of Justice, Mr. Hanan, to initiate legis-
lation some tirhe for establishing the
service on a formal basis.
Opposition Leader Kirk told Parlia-
ment this would alleviate public fears
about security operations. But when he
suggested modelling New Zealand
legislation on Australian lines there
were protests. One New Zealand
academic said it would be better to
deny the service legislative authority
and just “shoot” when they appear
above ground.
There is an ambivalent attitude
among many New Zealanders who are
conscious of the Security Sei'vice’s exist-
ence. They dislike the very existence of
the organisation, consider there is no
domestic need for it, consider it to be
anomalous in a democratic society, but
recognise that pressure from American
allies probably gives New Zealand no
alternative but to live with it.
It is the way in which they are
expected to live with it that has
occupied some attention.
Opposition Leader Kirk told
students several years ago that he
favored some form of judicial authority
constituted to sift the security files
according to acceptable rules of
evidence. Others have called for an
appeal authority to be set up, for
statutory limitations on the use and
accessibility of the security intelligence
information.
New Zealand’s Ombudsman, who was
constituted to act as the citizens’ pro-
tector against bureaucracy, has been
suggested as a person who should be
able to investigate allegations of
improper security activity.
However, Justice Minister Hanan
claims that Parliament in New Zealand
already knows more about its Security
Service than countries abroad know
about theirs.

INTERNATIONAL
THE WEEK IN AMERICA
Mrs. Onassis . .. the Cardinal (right)
burnt the letter she sent to him
MRS. ONASSIS' SECRETS
AMID THE world-wide chorus of
criticism and condemnation of her
marriage to Greek multi-millionaire
Aristotle Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis heard the strong voice of one
good old friend. Richard Cardinal
Cushing, religious adviser of the
Kennedy family, said talk of excom-
municating the 39-year-old widow of
the late President John F. Kennedy
from the Roman Catholic Church was
“a lot of nonsense.”
Talking last week to the Caritas
Guild, a Catholic group in Boston, the
73-year-old Cardinal said: “Months ago
I knew full well that Jacqueline
Kennedy was going to marry Aristotle
Onassis. I know what she has been
going through for many, many months.
I have been contacted by many of those
who are identified in high places with
the administration of the late President
Kennedy, and I have been contacted
by others intimately related and associ-
ated with the Kennedy family, to stop
all this from taking place—namely, that
Jack’s widow, God rest him, would
marry Aristotle Onassis. Well, I would
have no part. Finally she. was able to
' come to me, and she came to me a
week ago (October . 15). She came
secretly and unknown and unannounced.
And alone with myself she spoke to
me for about two hours. And I let her
talk because I knew she had confidence
in me. And I encouraged and helped
her in every possible way. I had a
letter from her that would be worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars if I
allowed any of the national secular
magazines to publish it, but I burned
the letter.
“My lips are sealed. I cannot tell
anything about the private, very private,
conversation I had with her. I turn on
the radio and all I hear are people
knocking her head off, as it were, criti-
cising her and so forth, and they are
so far from the truth that no one
would believe me if I ever got on a
radio program and revealed what I
know. All I know that I am able to
tell you is this: Caritas, charity.
“My love for her, her love for me,
really was the turning point in her
life, even though no matter what I
said to her she was already committed
to this marriage months ago, and I
knew it. Her husband, as of the present
time, has been down to
(the Kennedy home on Cape Cod,
Massachusetts) time and again in the
past months, just to get acquainted
with the children, so that they would
understand the whole picture.
“Why do people condemn her? This
idea of saying she is excommunicated,
a public sinner, what a lot of nonsense.
Only God knows who is a sinner, who
is not. Why can’t she marry whomever
she wants to marry and why should she
be condemned?
“Things are changing. The whole
world is changing. Priests are changing,
nuns are changing. People think the
Church is changing. I hope all these
changes are for the better. I am not a
theologian . . . I’m simply a humble
man trying to practise caritas, charity,
from the viewpoint of helping indi-
viduals, like my friend Jacqueline
Kennedy. She told me that she was like
a man drowning and grabbing a straw
until she met me some years ago, and
from that time on she always knew
that she had somebody to go to when
she felt abandoned by many, many
others. My life has been that of caritas,
that of love, love for all people.”
Mr. and Mrs. Onassis, honeymooning
aboard the luxury yacht Christina in
Greece, telephoned the Cardinal in
Boston to thank him for his support.
However, Vatican officials disputed the
Cardinal’s contention that Mrs. Onassis
could marry “whomever she wants.”
Vatican spokesman Monsignor Fausto
Vallaino said her marriage to a divorced
man, in a Greek Orthodox ceremony,
had placed the bride in an “irregular
position” with the Church and she was
now barred from all sacraments,
although she could attend Mass. Other
Vatican sources agreed with the Car-
dinal that Mrs. Onassis was not a public
sinner and had not been
excommunicated.
THE FOUR-LETTER CO-ED
PSYCHOLOGISTS and sociologists
have commented on the growing use
of obscene language among well-
educated American girls. Police at
Berkeley and other universities where
the “New Left” frequently stages noisy
demonstrations have been shocked by a
flood of obscenities from apparently
demure co-eds.
Many psychologists believe that the
general lessening of sexual restraints in
society, as reflected in films and other
mass media, has had a peculiarly strong
impact on female behaviour, verbal and
otherwise, simply because previous
taboos had been much stricter for
women than for men.
Dr. Philip Zimbardo, a psychologist
who taught at Columbia University
during the student riots early this year,
noted that “a co-ed was more likely
to curse a cop than a male student,,
perhaps because the man would expect
to be clubbed for it while the woman
would expect to be spared.” At Col-
umbia, he added, “the women were
very aware that cursing was a weapon,
one of the few they had. They knew
that police are largely drawn from the
lower class and that lower-class women
don’t curse. At least before men.” He
believed that Columbia co-eds were
consciously exploiting class differences
to enrage policemen whom they
viewed as oppressors.
The use of obscenities by women
was also a way of establishing equality
with men, Zimbardo commented. In
effect, they were saying, “Look, we’re
no different. We can stand up to auth-
ority. We don’t have to be babied.”
THE VIET CONG'S F-III?
ONE OF THE three Air Force F-11l
fighter planes lost in the Vietnam
fighting may have fallen into enemy
hands, with all its top-secret sophisti-
cated electronic equipment. Con-
gressional experts have raised the
question of the ultimate fate of two
of the three F-11l fighters lost in
Vietnam but have not received clear
answers.
Senator Richard Russell, chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee,
asked the Air Force Chief of Staff,
General John McConnell, at a closed
Committee session, if it would be con-
sidered a serious matter if the Com-
munists recovered one F-11l in
reasonably good shape.
“Yes, we have quite a few things
in it that we would not want the
enemy to get,” the General replied.
These included the plane’s electronic
devices in the so-called “black box,”
which enable the F-11l to find targets
in all kinds of weather. Another device
enables the plane to elude anti-aircraft

missiles. One of its most spectacular
devices is a terrain-following radar
which allows the plane to fly very low
in all weather at supersonic speeds
and avoid detection by enemy radar.
The radar system adjusts the plane’s
altitude automatically, reaching ahead
to compensate for hills and valleys in
its flight path.
The causes of two of the F-11l
crashes remain a mystery, Pentagon
officials state. However, two pilots in
the third crash were recovered and the
cause was later determined to be a
tube of sealant left in the plane. The
sealing compound had apparently
worked its way into the plane’s control
mechanism and jammed it.
BLACK, AND GLAD OF IT
THE WHITE HISTORIAN Ralph
Conant recently drew a parallel
Between the black revolutionists of
today and the white revolutionists of
1776. “When Americans gave up hope
of benefiting from the English institu-
tion of the monarchy and the colonial
system, they set up their own egalitarian-
value system and staged a revolution,”
Conant pointed out. “Some Negroes are
talking about organising their people
on the basis of separatist and collectivist
values, and they are moving away from
the melting-pot, individualistic values
of our country, which are not working
for them.”
One militant Negro leader said: “We
are organising around our strongest
bond, our blackness, and although
this will disturb some whites, it will
get black people together.” There is
a frenzy of activity and organising
in ghettoes, which were the scenes of
the worst rioting, such as Watts in
Los Angeles. “The riots started all
of us thinking,” a Watts psychiatrist
said. “Symbolically they established
manhood for blacks. It was a beginning
for many of an acceptance of our
"blackness. I had a feeling there was
nothing so good about having a Doctor
of Philosophy degree unless I was
relevant to my time and my people.”
The acceptance of “blackness” is
dramatised by the adoption of “Afro”
hairstyles by both sexes, a submergence
in “soul” or cultural attitudes common
to poor Negroes in their soul music and
soul food, and often the wearing of
native African costumes.
In a more directly practical Negro-
uplift operation, Pride, a youth-
training program in Cleveland, is
giving job training to 1000 hard-core
unemployed Negro youths, in land-
scaping jobs, painting, carpentry, and
similar skills. A young ex-convict said,
“People have got to make up their
minds to do something and then do it.
You see this happening with black
people today. I was busted (jailed) four
times before I made up my own mind
that I wanted more out of life, and
changed.”
Floyd McKissick, former head of
CORE (the Congress of Racial
Equality), has organised a company that
will work for “black economic independ-
ence.” McKissick, a lawyer, said the
company would operate several
businesses and also act as a resource
and training facility for other Negro
businesses. “If a black man has no
bread (money) in his pocket,”
McKissick pointed out, “the solution to
his problem is not integration it’s to
get some bread.”
However, there were some pessimistic
forecasts of worse dangers for American
cities than open rioting. These included
large-scale ambushing of white police,
as has already occurred in scattered
instances, to clashes between black
and white civilians, and violence
ranging from guerilla to civil war.
Sterling Tucker of the National
Urban League said, “We don’t have
the kind of commitment to justice
that America needs, and unless she gets
it she’s heading for suicide.”
THE CZECH BACKLASH
REPORTS FILTERING into the
U.S. recently from a Soviet under-
ground newsletter, titled “Chronicle of
Current Events,” have detailed incidents
of opposition to the invasion of Czecho-
slovakia in some of Moscow’s scientific-
research institutes.
According to the third issue of the
typewritten newsletter, the latest to
reach New York, “people found the
courage either to abstain from voting
or to vote against approval” at meet-
ings called through the Soviet Union
to endorse the invasion.
Opposition to the invasion, the news-
letter reports, ranged from collection of
signatures on protest petitions to public
demonstrations in Red Square. Scientists
refused to endorse the invasion at the
Institute of the International Workers’
Movement, and the Institute of World
Economy and International Relations.
Both these institutions are staffed by
political scientists and economists doing
research on political and social prob-
lems of the capitalist world. Their
findings are often used as the basis for
Russian policy-making.
The newsletter says that Western
Communist newspapers, such as
“L’Humanite,” of Paris, and “Morning
Star,” of London, no longer appeared
at Moscow news-stands after the
invasion had drawn criticism from
Western European Communist Parties.
Czech newspapers disappeared from
Moscow even before the Soviet
occupation.


RHODESIA
The Commonwealth coffin nail?
By COLIN LEGUM
CONTRARY TO what is widely
believed, no private deal was made
between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Smith on
board the Fearless last month.
To retrieve his bargaining position
after the Fearless talks, Mr. Smith
has tried to show that the differences
were so narrow that, if only Mr.
Wilson would relent a little more, an
agreement might yet be possible. Mr.
Smith has successfully used this
technique in the past to erode Britain’s
terms for a settlement.
Will he succeed this time? Certainly,
there will be further talks in Salisbury
with the Commonwealth Secretary,
Mr. Ceorge Thomson. But how
far will Mr. Wilson go beyond the
offer he made on Fearless? Even those
closest to the Prime Minister offer
totally opposite opinions. Some say a
settlement is bound to come in a
matter of months. Others say a
settlement can come only if Mr.
Smith is prepared to swallow the
Fearless terms without reservation.
There’s no doubt that Mr. Wilson
would win a great deal of popularity
with both sides of Parliament if he
came to almost any agreement with
Mr. Smith. The temptations for him
to do so must be great especially
as he is no longer likely to face the
resignation of a single senior Minister
of his Cabinet. ,
Scuttling out of Southern Africa
and thus avoiding involvement in its
seemingly unresolvable problems is
now a fashionable element of British
foreign policy. It appeals as. much to
the real-politik instincts of Labor’s
managers as it does to the Tories.
But it is not all that easy to cut
and run. Britain cannot simply forget
the Commonwealth or ignore - the
United Nations. Besides, the 100 Labor
MPs who still care deeply about
Rhodesia happen to be just those on
whom Mr. Wilson relies most to main-
tain his leadership over the Party.
In the weeks that now lie ahead,
Mr. Smith and Mr. Wilson are both
going to find themselves under heavy
pressure to narrow the gap.
The strongest argument for further
concessions is that as Britain has
deprived herself of the two quickest
ways of bringing down the Smith
regime (by using force or confronting
South Africa in order to make
sanctions totally effective) she must
either reach as respectable a settle-
ment as she can or- simply go on
denying the rebels their victory, and
letting them stew.
This second alternative really boils
down, in the end, to slowly strangling
Rhodesia’s economy over a period of
years during which time black violence
will mount, disorder will spread, and
the rebel regime will increasingly
come to rely on, and resemble, its
apartheid neighbor. At the end of the
day, Rhodesia will either have sue-
cumbed to black rule established
through violence and disorder or the
white supremacist rule of South Africa
will have extended itself as far north
as the Zambesi.
Rather than this, it is argued, it is
better to get an agreed constitution
which will start the process of a slow,
but peaceful, transition to majority
rule.
It is also argued that before any
settlement with Whitehall is imple-
mented the rebels will have to meet
the test of acceptance by all the people
of Rhodesia. This test is to be carried
Harold Wilson and lan Smith join in a hymn aboard HMS Fearless — AAP-AP photo
out by a Royal Commission
appointed by Britain without consult-
ing the Rhodesians to form an
independent opinion on whether the
majority of Rhodesians are willing to
accept the proposed independence
constitution. If they reject it, there
will be no settlement.
Critics of Mr. Wilson’s proposals
hold that no matter how copper-
bottom the guarantees they are not
worth the paper they are written on
because, in the end, they depend on
enforcement. And who is going to
enforce observance in the future?
Beyond verbal approaches no British
Government is likely to do anything
about breaches of the agreement; nor
is any other external Power likely to
intervene.
If paper guarantees are indeed value-
less, it makes little difference whether
Mr. Wilson agrees to make any further
concessions over the right of appeal
to the Privy Council. The absence of
such an external safeguard would, how-
ever, make it much harder for Britain
to argue the respectability of the
settlement or to sell it to black
Rhodesians.
What of the argument that the last
word on any settlement should rest
with the majority of Rhodesians? The
real objection is that no genuine test
of free opinion can be held under the
Smith regime. Not only will the entire
apparatus of government and informa-
tion media be in the hands of the
regime, supported by the coercive
power of the chiefs, but there can be
no real freedom for the opposition to
organise its political forces effectively.
Besides, there is not even a guarantee
that all the African leaders now in
detention, or in exile, will be set free.
Since the African nationalist leaders
are bound to adopt a militant opposi-
tion to the proposals, there can be no
assurance that they will be ready to
organise on lines approved by the
Smith regime. It is more than likely
that they will call for a boycott of the
Royal Commission. So the chances of
any effective test of opinion being
carried out under the conditions of law
and order, insisted upon by the Smith
regime, are not at all promising,
The weightiest criticism, however, is
that the effective African nationalist
leadership of Rhodesia—as well as of
their supporters in the rest of the con-
tinent—will, under no circumstances,
accept a settlement which transfers
independence to a white-minority
government.
The repudiation of Britain’s pledge
of Nibmar—no independence before
majority rule—will not be the end of
the story. It will only mark the begin-
ning of a new chapter, in which Britain,
instead of being on the side of those
championing majority rule, will be com-
mitted to upholding and defending the
legal right of a white-dominated
Rhodesia to maintain herself. Thus,
Britain will have become the ally of
the Smith regime, along with South
Africa. She will have taken the irrevoc-
able step of putting herself on the side
pf a white supremacy political set-up
in Southern Africa,
So far from having successfully dis-
engaged herself from Southern Africa,
Britain will have succeeded only in put-
ting herself into an even less defensible
position than she is now. She will come


under long and fierce attack in the
U.N.—on a race issue. She will be con-
fronted by a deep crisis—perhaps the
last—within the Commonwealth.
And, at the end of the day, Britain’s
action will not only have done nothing
to save Southern Africa from its bleak
future; she will have added to those
dangers by herself becoming an archi-
tect of a white-minority-ruled State at
a critical testing-time in the history of
color conflict.
FRANCE
Defusing France’s students
By PATRICK SEALE
WITH ALL THE skill of a bomb-
disposal expert, France’s Education
Minister, M. Edgar Faure, has drawn
the fuse of student unrest. If his bold
plans for university reform are put
swiftly into application—as he intends
—the chances of another “May Revolu-
tion” in France are remote. Already
the 60-year-old, honey-tongued M. Faure
is being hailed as the saviour of the
Gaullist regime and talked of as a
possible successor to the General him-
self.
The May revolt, which nearly over-
threw President de Gaulle, had its
roots in the overcrowded, over-
centralised, paternalistic French uni-
versity, unreformed since Napoleon’s
day. Faure’s task was to take a fresh,
hard look at the whole system of higher
education and rebuild it from the
ground up. It was a task demanding
great diplomatic gifts: he had both to
disarm the revolutionary students and
to satisfy the massive Gaullist majority,
which swept to power in last June’s
electoral landslide, thirsting for action
against the troublemakers.
In steering between these two reefs,
Faure has plumped for liberal and
imaginative formulas, which he has had
to defend against fierce attack from the
Gaullist Right. By skill, or by accident,
he now appears as the students’ cham-
pion, and even the most revolutionary
pay him grudging tribute.
His reform Bill, which faced a stormy
passage through the National Assembly,
embodies proposals wholly revolutionary
in the French context. In a nutshell,
they depose the Ministry of Education
in Paris as the source of all authority
and power over higher education, trans-
ferring decision-making to individual
faculties, research centres, and univer-
sities. From being intensely centralised,
the French educational system will thus
become one of the most decentralised
in Europe.
Faure’s second radical proposal is to
make the students equal partners with
the teachers and administrative staff in
the running of their colleges. From
being authoritarian, the system is to
become strikingly democratic. The
reforms are an attempt to harness
“student power” to constructive ends.
These twin notions of decentralisation
and democracy find expression in a
whole hierarchy of elected student-
teacher councils. At the local level,
each establishment will elect a council
to be its governing body, deciding on
curricula, research programs, organisa-
tion of studies, and so on, and enjoying
very considerable financial autonomy.
Up till now, university authorities have
had to get permission from Paris for
even minor repairs. Students are guaran-
teed up to 50 percent of the seats on
these councils. Other councils are to
be elected at the university, regional,
and national levels, including, at the
top of the pyramid, men and women
drawn from public life outside university
circles.
So much for the theory. But in prac-
tice this liberal program will be con-
siderably restricted. First, the Ministry
in Paris retains total control over both
the content and administration of all
examinations leading to national
degrees. Secondly, the broad lines of
French Education
Minister Edgar
Faure .. . talked
of as de Gaulle’s
successor
French education, the broad budgetary
decisions, the creation of new univer-
sities, will all still be decided at the
centre. Thirdly, exercise of student
power will also be checked in specific
ways: first-year students will have no
vote in the election of college councils;
only third-year students will have a say
in determining research programs; no
student voice will be heard in the
appointment of teachers, a prerogative
retained by the teaching staffs them-
selves.
A weakness of M. Faure’s Bill is that
it does not grasp the nettle of university
selection. At present the baccalaureat,
summit of the French secondary school
system, is a passport to higher educa-
tion. As a result. France has this year
more than 600,000 students—more than
Britain and Germany together —but
little more than half of them have any
real prospect of finishing the course.
Many, unsuited for higher education,
will drop out. The key problem of
French education is how to stop this
waste of men and resources. To intro-
duce university entrance examinations,
as in Britain, runs counter to deep-
seated French tradition and is politically
well-nigh impossible. Faure is attempt-
ing to curcumvent the problem by insti-
tuting a new certificate of secondary
education, less exalted than the bacca-
laureat, in the hope that on securing it
many pupils will consider their studies
at an end. He is also proposing a system
of short courses to leave the main
stream of university education un-
cluttered by any but the most serious
and capable students.
Even if Faure’s Bill is made law, in
a reasonably unemasculated form, its
problems are by no means over. Last
May’s revolt was powered at the univer-
sity level by would-be student reformers,
but also by revolutionary student politi-
cians. Faure’s plans may satisfy the
reformers, but will it silence the revolu-
tionaries? Throughout the troubles, they
campaigned for, and secured by brute
force, the right to hold political
meetings inside university buildings.
Inevitably, Faure is now being judged,
by both the, extreme Right and the
extreme Left, on whether or not
politics are to become a permanent
feature on the campus. He took a
bold line by saying that of course
students should take an interest in
politics, but immediately restricted
the practical consequences of his thought
by laying down that political discussion
could take place only in specially
designated rooms, and that no minority
could claim a monopoly of these
facilities. The great question mark is
how the political factions, which raised
hell from one end of France to another
last May, will interpret these provisions.
Whatever the doubts surrounding
Edgar Faure’s reform, it has two out-
standing merits. It is couched in gener-
ous, imaginative, and, above all, general
terms, laying down a broad line of
policy which allows those who have to
apply it a wide measure of responsi-
bility. And it gives everyone—teachers,
administrators, and frustrated students
alike—so much to do and think about
that the initiative in the crucial months
ahead will continue to lie squarely in
the Minister’s hands.


The style of Lord Casey
By BATMAN
LORD CASEY, at 78, is a phenomenon.
He still has the tall, straight bearing
from the days in 1918 when he was
Major Casey, DSO, MC, on the
General Staff. He has still the close-
clipped military moustache and his
hair is good. He remains a most hand-
some, distinguished man.
He still wears dark ties, his suits are
still double-breasted, but double-
breasted in the English style that never
went out of fashion. Except for reading
he does not wear glasses, and how old
does he look? His face is not excessively
lined. His manner is vigorous. He could
still be the Casey , of External Affairs.
He is, perhaps, a little hard of hear-
ing and visitors are advised to speak up
well. This could explain why he returns
The Governor-General examines a radio
being made for the Australian Army
constantly to the theme that we are
becoming a nation of mumblers.
And that is one embarrassing feature
about meeting the Governor-General.
He has the manners of the great host,
a natural well-bred desire to put his
visitors at ease, but the thought that
one might be mumbling is a little
unnerving, and one finds oneself almost
enunciating as at an elocution lesson.
Lord Casey became Governor-
General in September, 1965, and now,
after three years, it is clear that he has
given his own sense of style, made his
own thumbprint on the job. No other
Governor-General in recent times has
approached the job with such a verve,
with such a desire to make an impres-
sion, and make the job useful to the
country.
Whereas Lord Slim at times used
the armored-car, head-on approach,
Lord Casey has achieved the same
ends but with more subtlety. His breed-
ing and training for the job could
hardly be improved. The Caseys had
been in Australia since 1833, his father,
also Richard Gardiner (Jasey, had vast
pastoral and business interests.
Could we ever train another
Governor-General with this experience:
Education: Melbourne Grammar
School, Melbourne University, and
Cambridge; four years in the First AIF;
Australian political liaison officer in
London seven years; full range of
ministerial roles from Minister-in-
Charge of CSIRO, National Develop-
ment to Federal Treasurer and Minister
for External Affairs; Australian Minis-
ter to the U.S.A., 1940-42; member of
British War Cabinet, 1942-43; Governor
of Bengal, 1944-46.
He has an extraordinary sense of
protocol and understanding of
machinery of Government at all levels.
No gaffs ever come from Lord Casey.
In 1956, when Prince Philip made his
tour of Papua, New Guinea, and the
territories, only on two occasions did
he wear formal dress for formal occa-
sions. He wore a lounge suit and often
his shirt sleeves. This horrified all local
officers, because the Papuans and New
Guineans were expecting to- see the big
hhief, husband of the Queen, and they
were waiting for something magnificent.
But Lord Casey, when he went to Port
Moresby in 1967, made no such mistake.
Despite the heat, he wore tails, top hat,
and the full galaxy of medals. The
Papuans were suitably impressed that
here was a real Baron and a represen-
tative of the Queen.
He sees the job of Governor-General
as “Watchdog for the Queen, Watchdog
for the Government, and Watchdog for
the People.” He believes that freed
from the chicken coop of party politics
he can think deeply about his country,
that he can travel, look at it, talk to
thousands of people, and pass on to the
right people what he learns.
He said: “When I first took this job
I did not know much about Sydney, so
I asked for the names of 50 prominent
Sydney people and talked to them. I
think I have met them all now.”
Actually, he has met all 50 and 100
more. He runs lunches and dinners
daily. When he is in residence at
Government House someone is always
there. “People will talk to me,” he said,
“and tell me things with remarkable
frankness. More so than when I was a
politician. They do this, I think,
because they know I’m not going to
blab. And it is the opportunity to meet
such a wide variety of people that has
made this job much more interesting
than I anticipated.”
When one visits the Governor-General
the first move is into the large recep-
tion-roo,ms where the entertaining is
done. The cushions on the armchairs
are beautifully puffed, there are large
art books on the tables for reading;
then, surveying all, down the end, just
a little formidably, are life-size portraits
of King George 111 on the right and
Queen Charlotte on the left.
But the interviews do not take place
there. One goes to his office, or study, a
much smaller room, a restful place.
There’s a copy of the “Encyclopaedia
Britannica,” “Burke’s Peerage,” “Who’s
Who,” a desk, a quill pen, models of
aircraft he has owned, then a sofa for
two which faces a large window with
a view across a shaggy croquet lawn,
across Lake Burley Griffin to Black
Mountain. The sofa is not exactly a
hot seat, but this is where countless
people get interviewed every week.
He is in this office early every morn-
With British sailor Sir Francis Chichester
and some Australian wool products
ing. One member of his staff said: “If
there is another 78-year-old like him in
the country, keep him out of my way.
He starts at nine in the 'morning;
and finishes at ten at night, seven days
a week. Saturdays and Sundays are just
like other working days. We try to do
the right thing and keep the weekends,
clear, then he says ‘What have you got
for me on Saturday?’
“We went on two trips of six days
each and we covered nearly 12,000
miles at an average of 900 miles a day.
He returned to a visit fro,m the Head
of State of Korea. We were done, but
he wasn’t. You don’t want to sym-
pathise too much because he is being
overworked. He likes being Governor-
General.”
Indeed, there has been much com-
ment that after three years Lord Casey
may have had enough, that now he had
fulfilled his part of the bargain.
But Lord Casey does not see it this
way. “There is no immediate prospect
of my retiring here. I hope never to
retire in the ordinary way.” And he


Lord and Lady Casey are shown round
the Sydney Stock Exchange by the
chairman, Mr. J. Cooper
made it clear that if he did cease to
be Governor-General he would not
languish at his house at Berwick, out-
side Melbourne. He would be looking
for something else to do.
As it is now he gets only three or
four days a month at Berwick. His
official days consist of formal visits,
receiving the credentials of Ambass-
sadors, seeing members of the Govern-
ment, heads of Departments, members
of the Opposition, businessmen. He sees
all the papers submitted to Cabinet, all
Cabinet decisions, all External Affairs
papers IN and OUT. “Some of these,”
he said, “are one and a half inches
thick, and lately it has been a little too
much reading. I have asked for
summaries.”
There are Executive Council meet-
ings each week, and he signs all the
papers from the various Government
departments. “I will not sign anything
blind,” he said. “Sometimes I send them
back for clarification if they don’t make
sense.”
As Governor-General he cannot actu-
ally reject papers, but he finds if some
issue has not been thought out and he

his flying helmet before making a flight

tracker aircraft
sends it back, it returns much better
the next time. Furthermore, such mis-
takes are rarely repeated.
He makes about 100 major speeches
a year or two a week. Did he use
researchers and speechmakers? “Well, I
seek information, naturally,” he said.
“But every speech takes me at least
four or five hours to prepare. I can’t
put over a speech so'meone else has
written. It’s like cleaning another
person’s teeth.”
Lord Casey has had more to say
than other Governors-General, except
Lord Slim, but he has never set out for
controversy like Prince Philip. The
speeches against mumbling and sloppy
diction have caused the most letters to
the editor and he has big files of Press
clippings on these. He has also called
for understanding in student disturb-
ances, criticised architects for spurning
the veranda, castigated editors for not
having their own correspondents in
Asia, and warned scientists not to
ignore the humanities.
A Governor-General has to walk a
very narrow girder, for if he slips to
either side and becomes too contro-
versial, then the criticism can ultimately
reflect upon his office. So far, he said,
there had been only one serious com-
plaint. A senior politician had com-
plained to him “more in sorrow than in
anger.”
The Queen has now given permission
for Lord Casey to represent the Grown
abroad as Governor-General of Aus-
tralia. This means that, at least, instead
of travelling as a private citizen the
Governor-General could tour like a
President. Such tours could have many
advantages, the chief one being that a
Governor-General could go on good-
will missions to nations like Indonesia
or, say, Japan, with none of the political
overtones that would go with a tour by
a Prime Minister.
There have been suggestions that
legally this is not possible. Normally,
when a Governor-General goes overseas
an administrator is sworn-in to take his
place. So if an administrator has for-
mally taken over the role, how can the
Governor-General travel with the office
overseas? Lord Casey dismisses this
thought as technical rubbish. There
are at least 10 precedents for the
Canadian and other Governors-General
travelling overseas as Governor-General.
“When I was passing through New
Delhi this year it was with the greatest
difficulty that I stopped them from
treating me with all the protocol of
Governor-General,” he said. “They
were almost hurt when I told them I
was travelling as a private citizen.”
He is not easily drawn into a discus-
sion on the possibility of Australia be-
coming a republic. He sees no enthusi-
asm for it and nothing to be gained
whatsoever by breaking ties with Brit-
ain, indeed, much to be lost. He will
concede that there is sometimes con-
fusion in Asia when they see this
country in the South Pacific playing
“God Save the Queen” and flying a
flag which bears a Union Jack, confu-
sion which makes them wonder whether
we are still a colony of Britain.
But he says: “I have never encoun-
tered this confusion myself. In recent
years, at least six heads of State and
several Prime Ministers have visited
us. They came to us because we were
Australia, not because of any associ-
ation with the Queen. We are growing
up. You must realise people recognise
us as a nation in our own right,
although under the Crown and part of
the British Commonwealth.”
When one puts the thought that
surely we must be over-governed with
six State Governors, all representing
the Queen, he points out that each
State is paramount within its own
borders, while sharing its own powers
with the Commonwealth, and if they
were dismissed they would still have to
be replaced by • someone else. “They
are part of the Federal system,” he
said. “It 'might surprise you to know
that I am in contact with at least two
State Governors every day.”
But if Australia was to 'maintain its
links with the Crown, could we carry on
with a tough Australian line, insisting
After opening a new civil engineering
building at the University of N.S.W.,
Lord Casey looks through a stereo-
micrometer
that all the Queen’s men should be
Australians?
Lord Casey would not be drawn on
this, although he said he did have his
own views on the subject. He agreed
that the country was growing so fast
there might not always be enough
Australians left over for the nu'mber of
vice-regal jobs available.
Except when he is making the
Governor-General’s speech to Parlia-
ment, he must be non-political. Just
lately he has had what he calls a
“bee in his bonnet” about two things
development at all possible speed,
and decentralisation. He says that as
soon as one gets to anywhere outside
the capital cities people talk of little
else but the need for population and


industries. “It becomes,” he said, “like
a Greek chorus.
“Once a place reaches a certain
population, unless it can acquire some
new industries, then it can progress no
further. Sir Henry Bolte in Victoria
has an idea for pushing four country
centres. This is good, but here again
you can get into trouble. The four
chosen centres are happy, all the un-
chosen centres are furious.
“In Queensland and, particularly, in
Western Australia we are going ahead
very quickly, particularly in mining.
Our mining discoveries have been
astonishing. A good deal of what has
been found has been found with com-
parative ease. Attracted by the mining
boom, 50 companies of consequence are
now vigorously prospecting within the
next few years. My biggest worry is
that technical education is not keeping
pace with this. We are not producing
enough scientists, technologists,
engineers to keep pace with our newly
won resources and with what lies
ahead.”
Everything about Lord Casey is very
precise, very tidy. Like his father, and
his grandfather, all his life he has
kept a diary. He completes it the
same day. Some day there will be a
splendid supply of material for his
biographer.
In Lord Casey’s most recent book,
“Australian Father and Son,” published
by Collins in 1966, he produced so’me
material from his father’s diary. It
gave a lovely picture of a long-gone
era.

In 1903, R. G. Casey, sen., bought
100 dozen bottles of Andrew Rowan’s
White Hermitage, grown and bottled
at his vineyard in Lilydale, in Victoria,
in 1889. The vineyard was wiped out
by phylloxera soon afterward. I asked
Lord Casey if there was any of this
left.
He said: “Yes, there are still three or
four bottles of it in the cellar. We
opened some recently, and, you know,
it is still good. Extraordinary for a
white wine. I can only explain it as a
freak. Yes, I have a reasonably good
cellar. But we don’t drink much aged
wine. We get most of our wine from
a little grocer in Prahran for about
35 cents a bottle. Very good it is, too.”
R. G. Casey, sen., had a passion for
horses, and he made some spectacular
bets. He won £6OOO on Calma in the.
Caulfield Cup of 1883 and £2OOO on
Carbine in the Melbourne Cup of 1890.
He was chairman of the Victoria Racing
Club from 1907 to 1916. In “Australian
Father and Son” Lord Casey recalled:
“When I was a boy in Melbourne I
Mr. Richard Gardiner Casey, father
of the Governor-General
once heard my father say to his trainer,
James Scobie, ‘What do you think of
my boy, Scobie?’ ‘Well, I’m sure he’ll
grow up into a fine young man, sir,
but it must be a great grief to you that
he doesn’t seem to know a horse from
a cow.’ ”
The non-devotion to horses persisted.
It is said that he put up a record for
non-attendance at Flemington almost
from World War I until he attended
the Melbourne Cup officially as
Governor-General.
Yet the father’s love of horses must
have been passed on in the son’s love
of motor-cars and aeroplanes. He has a
17-year-old Bentley, “a dear old thing,”
and a Porsche, which he keeps at Ber-
wick.
Then he has a Mini Cooper S, which
Lord Casey at an Indian village during
his term as Governor of Bengal, from
1944 to 1946
is at Government House, Canberra.
The thought of the Governor-General
dashing around Canberra in a Mini
Cooper may sound a little startling, but
Governors-General are precious and he
is not permitted to drive it very much.
He said a little sadly: “My secretary
drives it more than I do.”
Lord and Lady Casey both learned
to fly in 1938. It came about because
of a need for quick transport from
Canberra back home to Berwick.
Lady Casey learned in a Taylor Cub
that was so slow that sometimes it was
battling at 40 mph. One day she landed
backward in a high wind. Their first
aircraft was a Percival Vega Gull. The
next was a Fairchild 24, bought in
America. “I loaned it to the Govern-
ment during the war and they gave it
back when it was over. Then we flew
a Miles Messenger for ten years or so,
until it was falling to bits. Now we
have a ten-year-old Cessna 180. A good
aeroplane.”
But what about flying now? He runs
into the same problem as with the
Mini Cooper. He is too expensive to
lose. “I only fly enough hours to keep
A photograph of the “flying Caseys ”
in 1940 when he was appointed Aus-
tralian Ambassador to Washington
up my licence. My wife does all the
flying. They don’t make it easy for me.
The Director-General of Civil Aviation
keeps me hedged in. I am only allowed
up with another pilot.”
So the Governor-General gets little
time for recreation. He has given an
almost unique example of how the job
should be carried out, and in so doing
he has made it doubly hard for the
Government to find a successor, particu-
larly an Australian.
Can you think of a name? John
McEwen? Dr. Coombs? Sir Macfarlane
Burnet? A great artist or a writer, per-
haps? Well, who? Patrick White? Sidney
Nolan? Thoughts immediately go back
to Sir Robert Menzies. Always he
seemed to scorn the job and, then, is he
any longer fit? Would you have Sir
Percy Spender?
Finding a Governor-General such as
we have now with a record of nearly
50 years’ service to Crown and country
is singularly difficult anywhere.

WAITING FOR THE
“WE LIVE in the most exciting time
this country has known. For so long
in the past we were not a nation as
a whole, but this has all changed
dramatically,” said Mr. Gorton last
month at Moorabbin, during his appeal
to Australians to develop a new sense
of nationalism. Was the Prime Minister
asking for something really new or
was he engaging in one of the oldest
habits of those who talk about Australia
and its future?
Australian nationalists have con-
tinually been engaged in drawing atten-
tion to some crucial event or period
whereby, they claim, our nation de-
cisively came to birth' or maturity, when
independence (either political, social,
or economic) was attained, and we
became one, autonomous and identi-
fiable as such for the first time, so that
a national identity and culture were
securely founded. In all cases, a
national “coming-of-age” is invoked; at
some stage a take-off point was reached;
we had crossed the threshold, there
had been a revelatory opening into a
new world of our own; a real basis
was established on which a fruitful
developing process could be pursued
through subsequent time. After this
real start, one had one’s own history:
there is a tradition, a continuity which
can be traced from the start through
to the present day.
Such is the pattern of these claims.
Of the many attempts to pinpoint
the time when things first got off the
ground in Australia, the most per-
sistent and publicised has been that
usually (and naturally) referred to as
the “Australian tradition.” It falls
roughly into three parts:
• Eureka and the goldrush decades
were looked back to by the 1890 s
optimists as the time when it all
started the beginnings of the spon-
taneous democracy of the brotherhood
of man, the eight-hour day, social
legislation, the gaining of freedom by
the diggers; and it was thought that
this start was being brought to fruition
and maturity in the 1890 s. For those
already disillusioned, it was seen as a
past Golden Age, which had now been
entirely subverted, and a “new start”
(for example, in Western Australia or
Paraguay) was needed. Professor Man-
ning Clark has documented these
attitudes in his article “Rewriting
Australian History” (1956).
• In the decades after the goldrushes,
there was a widespread feeling that
this national birth was imminent, e.g.,
Brunton Stephens’ “The Dominion of
Australia” (1870 s):
She is not yet, but he whose ear
Thrills to that finer atmosphere . . .
Hears in the voiceful tremors of the
sky
Auroral heralds whispering “She is
nigh” ...
She waits the incorporating word.
To bid her tremble into form.
and Henry Lawson’s first poem, the
“Song of the Republic” (1887):
Sons of the South, your time will
come —
Sons of the South, ’tis near —
The “signs of the Times,” in their
language dumb,
Foretell it, and ominous whispers hum
Like sullen chords of a distant drum,
In the ominous atmosphere.
Stephens is the first of that line of
poets (Stephens, Lawson, Arthur
Adams, Daley, Gilmore, O’Dowd,
Furnley Maurice) who can be called
the poets of prophetic-rhetorical
gestures of nationalist assertion and
wish-fulfilment. A quotation from
O’Dowd’s “Poetry Militant” (the title
is indicative of the nature of the enter-
prise) shows this: “The fact of evolu-
tion and the fact of Australia make
Australian poets, if they will, essentially
poets of the dawn, poets whose func-
tion it is to chart the day and make
it habitable marching poets, working
poets, poets militant.”
The combination of this strain with
utopian dreams transferred to a rural
bush paradise setting produced the
movement which culminated in the
nationalist “coming-of-age” outburst of
the 1890 s, which is, of course, the
paradigm in Australian history of all
attempts to locate the start of
national independence. As with the
1850 s, the 1890 s was resurrected as a
Golden Age by some of the dis-
illusioned radicals of the 19405. Others,
like Brian Fitzpatrick and lan Turner,
saw conscription, the IWW, and indus-
trial Labor during the period of World
War I as the start of the 1940 s move-
ment.
• The third stage in the nationalist
myth was the attempt in the 1940 s to
take over the nationalist-mateship
sentiments in order to produce a new
utopia, the industrialised Socialist/
Marxist/Communist paradise; this
mateship-socialism was directed to
quite different ends than the 1850 s and
1890 s ventures from which it claimed
continuity.
As the writer of the article “The
New Nationalism?” (The Bulletin,
October 5) says of Mr. Gorton’s
speech: “The idea of ourselves as a
nation of bushwackers became demo-
graphically unbearable and no one con-
vincingly retranslated the rhetoric of
mateship into new terms.” As a con-
temporary viable world-view, the “Aus-
tralian tradition” has been seen to have
lapsed for at least a decade it is
now just another of the unsuccessful
attempts at announcing the “real start”
and describing the “real” Australian
type. In fact, it never had the con-
tinuity of a genuine tradition. At each
stage it gained support by combining
the attractions of a new form of utopia
with a cashing-in on the prestige of
the previous utopian vision, a vision
quite contradictory to the present one.
And, moreover, what appear to be
attempts at pure historical assessment
and interpretation within this “tradi-
tion” are also, and more importantly,
retrospective creations of a national
birth or coming-of-age.
The “Australian tradition” was the
main attempt, but there have been
many others in the compulsory activity
of spotting the time when things really
started here:
• The deeds of the bronzed Anzacs.
• The watershed in many areas in the
later part of the 1930 s after the
Depression. Professor Crawford says of
this period in his “Australian Perspec-
tive”: “Rarely indeed is one given the
means of dating the coming-of-age of a
new nation so precisely as they are
given in this case.” Descriptions of the
appearance of modern Australian intel-
lectual, literary, and artistic life in this
period can be found in, among others,
Chris Wallace-Crabbe’s article “Among
the Front Runners” (“Dissent,” Spring,
1967) and John Pringle’s “Australian
Painting Today.”
• The break from Britain, as expressed
The false
in Curtin’s famous wartime speech on
December 27, 1941: “Without any
inhibitions of any kind, I make it quite
clear that Australia looks to America,
free of any pangs as to our traditional
links of kinship with the United King-
dom.” As well as this, there was the
fervor and purpose in getting the
economy and structures of the country
planned and moving during the war,
of which Colonel Alf Conlon became
to some writers the somewhat bizarre
symbol. W. W. Rostow says in “The
Stages of Economic Growth” that the
decisive economic “take-off” toward
full industrialisation in Australia
occurred during World War 11. Pro-
fessor Partridge has said of the period
in “Australia” (ed. Greenwood) that
“for many years it had been a cliche of
Australian oratory that Australia
achieved nationhood through the
exploits of her troops at Gallipoli in
1915. It could be argued that World
War II brought about a much more
decisive advance toward national
maturity; (it) led to a broadening of
attitude of mind among a considerable
proportion of Australians.”
• An increased intellectual sophistica-
tion in the later 1950 s in a number
of interconnected areas. With the


By PATRICK MORGAN
dawns of Australian nationalism
implication that we were now part of
the world community; the fruits of this
can be seen in Peter Coleman’s
symposium “Australian Civilisation.”
• The awakening of Australia to the
world by the effects of the three As,
Art, Affluence, and Asia in the 19605.
Craig McGregor’s “Profile of Aus-
tralia” is an example of this claim.
All these accounts are based on an
independence of some sort a break-
through to freedom. They write from
the point of view of the exclusive,
militant group which is just on the
point of success. Australian history, the
past, consists of the struggle of the
small, vitalising group in a hostile
environment which is never defined.
This follows the pattern set by Lawson:
Sons of the South, aroused at last!
Sons of the South are few!
But your ranks go longer and deeper
fast,
And ye shall swell to an army vast,
And free from the wrongs of the
North and Past
The land that belongs to you,
(This causes the poverty of general
social critique in this country; e.g.,
the Australian myth interpretation,
because of its exclusive interest in the
existence and progress of the mateship
man, completely ignored those Right-
wing, Liberal, middle-class, respectable
people who have been the majority
group in Australia all this century at
least.)
In contrast with the past, the present
is seen as the period of the triumph
of the group; or sometimes it is seen
as about to triumph; that is, the
retrojection of future expectations on
to the present. Thus, Mr. Gorton is
reported to have said in his speech
that the slow rate of change which
had taken place up to and during
World War II had now given way to
an explosion.
Each claim denies (correctly) that
the ones before it were successful; this
has the effect of perpetuating the
vacuum. Each claim denigrates and
devalues the past as the time before the
real birth. Hence, today’s starters, like
McGregor, denigrate and devalue our
first 50 years this century (correctly)
as bourgeois, conformist, and dull. But
they don’t describe the period in
detail; their only interest in the past is
to trace the embryonic activities of the
lonely movement which has now burst
into fruition. Each sees the period
before only as a revelatory opening to
a higher level, and all developments
afterward are incorporated as a
development of the claimant’s tradition;
e.g., Professor Crawford absorbs the
movements of the ’forties and ’fifties
into his interpretation, though they
themselves claim autonomy. In each
case, the future is seen as dependent on
the present breakthrough; so Mr.
Gorton said: “These developments will
so transform this country that in
another ten or 15 years we will be more
than able to play a full role in the
world around us.”
The Australian myth interpretation
of the vitalising role of the Labor
forces in Australian life is simply the
stereotype, the first- and best-known of
all these claims. Said Randolph Bed-
ford: “And then I saw my first copy
of The Bulletin and thereby entered
a new world ... it was Australian,
whereas all the daily papers of Sydney
were English provincials.” This claim
also tries to assimilate later turning-
points, for example, the Anzacs.
When the nationalist venture failed,
alternative ventures were indulged in;
but the habit of announcing the start
and seeking a coming-of-age, which the
nationalists saw as their primary con-
cern, continued and has gone on ever
since. One inverted form of this is
described by the writer of “The New
Nationalism”: “Australia was taken to
have come of age to the extent that it
ceased to be like itself and became
instead like some other place a
mythical ‘Overseas.’ ”
Recent popular books on Australia,
true to the pattern, all emphasise that
a significant change is just around the
corner. George Johnston ends the text
of “The Australians” by claiming
vaguely and impressionistically that
“the smell of imminence, of things yet
to happen, pervades the air” (p. 281).
Don Whitington in “In Search of An
Australian” hopefully detects the be-
ginning of the new Australia in, of all
events, the annual “Meanjin” v. “Over-
land” cricket match at Templestowe:
“Here, in~the crucible of Templestowe,
there could be the embryo of the Aus-
tralia of tomorrow. Here, and in half
a hundred, half a thousand hamlets
like it around Australia, the iron is
being thrust into the flames to produce
a new national type.”
McGregor’s last sentence is: “Aus-
tralian society has become complex
enough to embrace the extremes and
contradictions its own strength has
generated, and perhaps it is in this
field that it has achieved the maturity
which writers on Australia, nationalists
to the last man, have forever tried to
thrust on their once-colonial country.”
McGregor is a nationalist himself here,
though I doubt if he is the last one.
Though conscious of the pattern of
announcing the breakthrough, he
indulges in it himself at the same time.
His breakthrough, he believes, is being
effected: the new, young, cool,
detached, professional generation is
taking over from the old, Right, con-
servative, illiberal, reactionary,
amateurish mass. But to the extent to
which this is actually happening, this,
too, has failed to set up a permanent
tradition; once again we are left with
nothing but a vacuum. Anything new
has to be productive in spite of the
environment: there is no network of
concerns which encourages it.
All these claims have failed to set
up something permanent and con-
tinuous in Australian life, and also to-
provide some continually fruitful
interpretation of it. The mateship
beliefs have collapsed; the Labor Party
has failed in its aims; so has the mean-
ing of Anzac. The Crawford watershed
hasn’t produced the goods and the
directions of the Coleman symposium
have not been extended. As for the
current talk of the McGregor variety,,
it mistakes change for a new start. Of
course we will be very different now
from the ’thirties and ’forties: change
is easy, ever-present, and inevitable.
But a real tradition is something that
doesn’t so much change but is modi-
fied and enlarged. The mere facts of
art-booms, affluence, and Asia won’t
necessarily make a difference. It’s only
if their radical ramifications are grasped
that anything permanent will be
effected and there aren’t many signs:
of this at the moment. In another ten
years it will be something else . . .
Why have all the claims failed? One
of the troubles is that the usual way
the compulsive nationalists go about
things is to erect in advance some
utopian vision of what they would like
Australia to be; then they either
examine Australian reality and Austra-
lian literature for evidence of its
nationalist potential or, more usually,
by an insistent assertion of their
dreams in prophetic tone, they gradu-
ally come to convince themselves that
what is desirable actually exists. They
nominate it into existence as it were,
or, as Vincent Buckley paraphrases
them: “Our literature exists because it’s

got to exist. It is about to be created,
or to be recognised as such.”
Nationalists in other countries have
made similar claims, but with the
important difference that they have
been largely or partly correct, whereas
in Australia all attempts have failed.
There has been no start, no break-
through that still subsumes a fruitful
tradition. All the claims have been the
assertions of publicists and promoters,
not the results of the study of Austra-
lian reality. All have been premature
announcements, false dawns, manifes-
toes instead of achievements; nothing
sufficiently real to be a permanent
basis has yet come into existence in
Australia. The Australia-promoters keep
talking about our “uniqueness”; Mr.
Gorton said that the new nationalism
would bring into existence a nation
unique in the world. But Australia’s
only uniqueness among the world’s
countries is that here nothing has
started. And the false announcements
of a “start” help to perpetuate the
vacuum.
Because of this, what we have here
all the time is simply change and
nothing else. This gives Australian life
its ephemeral, disjointed, and dissi-
pating quality: our history becomes a
series of isolated parts, each rejecting
the ones before as unsalvageable, but
substituting an alternative venture of
the same kind in place of it. For
instance, the intellectual arguments of
the 1940 s seem quickly dated and
unrelated to the present when read
qow; on the other hand, the impression
is given that the same sort of fruitless
debate was going on then as now, that
there has in this sense been no progress.
The simple fact of change only is
evidence against the existence of a
tradition, not for it.
In an article in “Quadrant”
(2/1968) called “Images of Australia,”
R. W. Connell detects similarities in
all accounts of Australian life, and
implies plagiarism in the authors; but
it is not a matter of culpable or
fraudulent borrowing, but simply of
working on the same basic pattern.
When Mr. Gorton claims: “There has
been a sudden explosion in this country,
which has not yet reached its heights.
All our old conceptions have to be
reassessed,” one is entitled to wonder
if this is the latest in the long line
of similar pronouncements, and
whether it will have the same fate as
the others.
Leslie Fiedler called his book on
apocalyptic movements in American
literature in the past half-century
“Waiting For The End.” Our position
can still be called “Waiting For The
Start.” It’s not that the sentiments
behind the call for a new nationalism
are wrong; it’s that it is not likely to
come through the announcement of a
sudden explosion or breakthrough to a
coming-of-age. In “Such is Life,” Tom
Collins exclaims, “O Virgin continent!
How long has she tarried her bridal
day.” She may have to wait much
longer than Tom Collins ever imagined.

The Torres Strait
Islanders move South
By GEOFFREY PEREGRINE
Right, a high school at Thursday
Island provides education for all, but
job opportunities afterward are limited.
Below, Thursday Island girls form the
workforce at the new prawn- and fish-
processing factory on the island
IN THE NEXT few years, white Aus-
tralians can expect to find a sizable
black migrant group in their midst. The
islanders' of Torres Strait and Cape
York have decided on a policy of
integration and opportunity. They are
already on the move south and west
in increasing numbers. These islanders
are Australia’s other native minority.
They are distinctly different from the
mainland Aborigines' and different
again from the Papuans to the north.
They are forsaking their paradise-like
islands, which dot Torres Strait, to
give themselves the chance of a better
material way of life.
To win this chance they are prepared
to live in the crowded suburbs and
share the tough life of the outback. The
conditions they live in are crowded
and primitive. The jobs they get are
the hard ones which other Australians
don’t want laboring in the northern
tropics or fettling in the dusty, dry rail-
way projects of Western Australia or
the Northern Territory. Unpleasant
these might be, but this offers a way
out from a life that is clearly a dead
end.
Queensland’s Department of Island
and Aboriginal Affairs, which is
responsible for the welfare of Torres
Strait Islanders, estimates there are
about 8000 of them. Island leaders
estimate that some 2000 have already
“gone south” and departmental
officials agree with this guess.
Both island politicians and Queens-
land officials agree there is no future
for these people where they live now.
They have adopted a program of
education and assimilation in the Aus-
tralian community, and this inevitably
means immigration.
The islanders may feel that progress is
too slow, that they deserve a. bigger
slice of the good things Australia has to
offer. A situation is developing which
could see them become a significant
pressure group, not passively appealing
to the nation’s conscience as the
Aborigines do, but taking advantage of
solid political clout in a balance-of-
power situation. About 2000 islanders
have the vote, and the number will in-
crease quite rapidly over the next few
years. They are a closely knit com-
munity, with a well-developed sense of
politics, and an administrative organisa-
tion that favors the development qf a
bloc vote. There are signs that this
process already is at work. This vote
has already emerged as a considerable
force in State politics, and the first con-
tenders have already made the pilgrim-
age north to woo it.
The significance of the island group
lies in the background of the electorate
in which they live, the State division of
Cook, and the rivalry in Brisbane be-
tween the Country Party and the second-
fiddle Liberal Party in Queensland’s
governing coalition. The sitting member
for Cook is Mr. H. A. (Bunny) Adair,
now an independent, who is retiring
for personal reasons. As is often the
case in the North, Mr. Adair held the
seat on the strength of his personality
and, although the State parties are
fielding candidates in the next State
election early next year there is every
probability that the fight could once
again be on personalities rather than
on party grounds. Few people are
prepared to guess how it might go.
But parties are still important when
it comes to counting heads in Parlia-
ment in Brisbane, some 1200 miles
away to the south, and the Country
Party badly needs Cook. For the senior
Government party, every head counts
if it is to retain its seniority. As in
other States, Queensland’s Liberal
Party has been restive for years in its
relationships with the Country Party.
The bright young men who have moved
into party positions of power chafe at
the Country Party domination of the
State and feel that this is one of the
factors holding Queensland back
economically. The Liberals next elec-
tion will contest some traditional
Country Party seats and could well
win one or two of them. Many Liberals
believe that in the natural course of
events their Party will emerge as the
majority in the coalition, and this
would sink the Country Party as a
major political force in its last bastion
in Australia.
Not surprisingly, first into the field
after the 2000 island votes was burly
Jim Bidner, endorsed Country Party
candidate for Cook. Bidner, a Cairns
detective-sergeant, brings to his poli-
tical quest the advantages of a police
training—a memory for people and
names and the connections of relatives.
For years he has been a familiar figure
right through the electorate. Recently
he took some leave to travel throughout
the islands and to attend one of the
main social functions of the Far North
Peninsula, the annual show at Bamaga
Aboriginal and islander settlement,
right at the northernmost tip of Cape


York Peninsula, a coconut’s toss from
the Cape itself.
Bamaga lies about 18 miles south
of Thursday Island, the only town in
the area. As a Government settlement,
it is administered by the Department
of Island and Aboriginal Affairs. It has
a population of about 1200, most of
them islanders or Aborigines who have
been closely influenced for many gener-
ations by the nearby island culture.
With the exception of Thursday Island,
the populated islands of the Torres
Straits are all settlements, and in their
form of government lies the nucleus
of the political machine w'hich is now
assuming significance.
The unique situation of today’s 8000
Torres Strait Islanders goes back to
their origins and not much is knowm
about that except that they are dis-
tinctly different from either the Abo-
rigines or the inland Papuans. There
are also minor differences between the
Eastern and Western Islanders.
Up to 1871 they were notorious as
a fierce and proud people, defending
their islands against all-comers and
waging continual war among them-
selves. Head-hunting was their manly
Islanders leave

art, fishing their livelihood, and they
cheerfully attacked all ships passing
through their narrow- strait whenever
they had the chance. The Europeans
came to stay in 1871, an occasion now
known as the “coming of the light.”
The London Missionary Society sent
its people ashore on Darnley Island and
brought Christianity to the group. The
LMS withdrew some 50 years later and
the Anglican Church replaced the
Society as a major influence right
through the area.
Other Europeans w-ere not far
behind the missionaries. They were
joined by Malays, Chinese, and
Japanese, and the great days of pearling
began. From the end of the last cen-
tury a steady demand grew for pearl-
shell for buttons and jewellery.
At the peak of the industry, in 1929,
there were about 120 boats based on
Thursday Island. But the World
Depression, World War 11, plastics,
and cultured pearls eventually drove
the industry under, and today only
about 12 boats operate out of T. 1.,
mainly to supply pearl oysters to the
culture farms, where the shellfish
are “seeded” with grit to produce
pearls.
Over the years the Queensland Gov-
ernment administered the various
islands in the traditional handout
manner, although the rations, services,
and attention were always meagre. The
Islanders, when they needed money,
became indentured on the luggers and,
while they were never very highly paid,
many made enough to maintain a
viable economy right through the
group. Back on their home islands, the
laborers and divers either remitted
enough or brought home the money to
buy kerosine, fishing-lines, and a few
other requirements. The women and the
unemployed grew subsistence gardens
and fished. It was never an idyll.
Disease was too common. Diving at
best was a hazardous occupation. Qften
the islanders were roughly treated and
exploited. But over these years they
retained the identity of their owm island
settlements and institutions.
The Queensland Government atti-
tude, let me say, has completely-
changed, and at a rapid pace, in recent
years. While still short of funds, the
Department is working to establish
education and medical services
throughout the group and has publicly
set forward the aim of assimilating
these people in the mainstream of
Australian life. The day-to-day Gov-
ernment administration is indirect.
Locally, the islanders govern them-
selves in a council framework very
similar to Local Government in Papua
and New Guinea. All adults have the
vote for local councils, which, in their
turn, have the right to tax and pass
local laws.
The islands and the mainland
Bamaga settlement are divided geo-
graphically into three groups of coun-
cils. These elect group representatives,
who are the main contact between the
Department, based on Thursday Island,
and the people. The system gives the
group representatives a fair measure
of local power and certainly makes
them politically conscious. Incumbent
councillors seem to have the ability to
rnanage election campaigns to maintain
a continuity of pow'er, not only for
themselves but for their supporters as
well. Often these supporters are mem-
bers of a leading family group who
firmly hold the power. The same names
crop up time after time in the ranks
of councillors, and also, in the ranks
of the council-appointed police, who
handle local law and order.
This ability to command a bloc
vote and the likelihood that local bosses
can deliver it in external elections
ensure the strength of the islanders
as a political force. The emergence of
this bloc vote follows recent moves
which give the islanders and mainland
Aborigines the vote, if they register for
it. Until they do this, they are under
no compulsory obligation as are other
Australians. A significant proportion of
eligible islanders is already on the rolls
and the number of registrations is
increasing.
The present leader of the Torres
Strait Islanders is a heavy-set Badu
man, Tanu Nona, senior councillor on
his island, which is about 30 miles west
of Thursday Island. He is also group
representative for the dominant West-
ern people, and the senior group
representative, the top leader for all
the islands. Mr. Nona now lives on
Thursday Island, where over the years
he has built up a considerable business,
with interests in luggers, the supply
of pearlshell, and other enterprises. Mr.
Nona is very much the politician. He’d
happily fit into a smoke-filled backroom
in Washington, Canberra, or Mac-
quarie Street and would immediately
become part of the scene.
When I first called on him at his
house in Pearl Street, Thursday Island,
he was sitting under his typically North
Queensland house in conference with
his fellow group representatives. He
wasn’t too keen on an interview. I
gathered the matter which brought
them together was important and
private and connected with the
Country Party man’s visit. I could see
him later. Perhaps at the Bamaga
Show'?
By chance I found myself on the
same boat as Mr. Nona as we ran
down to Bamaga. We sat below the
bridge in the early morning and
watched the islands slip astern and the
panorama of the Cape York beaches
roll past as we talked. Mr. Nona is
a man of about 60. His home island of
Badu is known throughout the Strait
for its seamen and boatbuilders. Mr.
Nona told me that, like all island
people, he feels at home only on
or alongside the sea. He first shipped as
a hand aboard a trochus lugger at the
age of 12. Believing he would be too
small for the job, young Nona put on
two sets of clothes, w’ith a boiler suit
over everything to make him look
bulkier. During the boom years of the
industry he worked on both pearl and
trochus luggers, eventually establishing
his own interests and carving himself
out an empire. But even as a success-
ful man of business and affairs, Mr.
Nona is convinced that for his family
the only hope lies in migration.'
Counting them up, Mr. Nona told
me 18 members of his family had
migrated, most to Brisbane but some

"ARMOURCLAD” Coloured Spandrel Glass is
toughened float or roughcast glass with the
colour permanently fused on one side. It is
widely used as a cladding material in the
building industry due to its permanent colour.
It resists thermal stress and impact shock, and
has decorative applications in domestic
buildings.
is a relatively new form of safety glass,
consisting of a tough flexible layer of vinyl
sandwiched between two layers of float glass.
After repeated impacts, the vinyl layer
supports the broken glass, maintaining a
highly resistant barrier to felonious entry.

"TripleX"
"TripleX” Laminated Safety Glass is made from best
quality float or sheet glass. It consists of two pieces of
glass firmly united to a plastic interlayer. It does not
discolour and is not affected by moisture or normal
weather conditions. This glass may crack under impact,
but holds firmly together in one piece, preserving
visibility and the safety value.
"ARMOUR FLOAT"
is toughened float glass, flat or curved, which if broken
disintegrates into small non-harmful particles. It is used
as automotive safety glass, in windows, counters,
showcases, in fact all applications which require strength,
safety and transparency.
"ARMOURCAST"
glass is toughened in a similar manner to "ARMOUR-
FLOAT” and embodies the same safety qualities; the
difference is that one surface is flat and the other
patterned to gently diffuse the light. "ARMOURCAST"
is used to advantage internally where privacy is required,
together with natural light. It is available in a variety of
patterns to suit modern designs.

to jobs in Western Australia and the
Northern Territory on the railways.
One of his sons is a railway construc-
tion foreman. A nephew lives in Bris-
bane, in a home which Mr. Nona has
bought. A cousin was killed in Korea.
The islanders found it hard to leave,
he said, but few had regrets when they
had gone. They tended to establish a
new r identity in the South and, while
many lived either together or in the
same areas, they were gradually
assimilating into the community.
For the inlanders who did not want
to go south, Mr., Nona could see only
the possibility of establishing agricul-
tural settlements on Cape York. And
this, in fact, has been the story of
Bamaga. It was originally settled by
a group of Saibai Islanders from the
North, and the Queensland Government
is now spending a lot of money to
make it a viable proposition economi-
cally, with irrigation for crops, roads,
timber extraction, schools, and medical
services. Mr. Nona could see little hope
of the islands supporting their present
population, let alone the pressures that
would arise when today’s children (who
often number a quarter of the popula-
tion of an island) grew up.
Certainly, the prospect of develop-
ment of Thursday Island itself is
remote. Already, it is inadequate for
its role as an administrative settlement
for the Torres Straits and northern
Peninsula. Once I used to divide tropic
ports into a private classification. This
place, I used to say, was Somerset
Maugham. That place was Joseph
Conrad. Thursday Island, I felt before
I w r ent there, would be vintage
Maugham. And so I suppose it is, but
rather as if it had been trapped
between the covers of a book printed
in the 19205, tossed on to a rubbish
heap, and allowed to moulder there.
Superficially it has had all the
ingredients of a paradise. Coconut
palms lining the main street shiver in
the trade wfinds. The same south-
easterlies chop up the seas of the
Straits and pearling luggers bob at
anchor off the waterfront. In the bars,
suntanned characters talk of the sea, of
pearl shell, and of fish.
But how woebegone, decrepit,
obscene the reality is. The town
moulders. Paint peels off the ram-
shackle buildings. Drains stink in the
main street. Bitumen (only in the town
area) is breaking up. Grass grows rank
in corner allotments which must once
have been prosperous stores or ware-
houses. And the girls complaisant
perhaps, enthusiastic according to
legend contribute to one of the
world’s all-time high VD rates (which
amazed even the experts of the World
Health Organisation, passing through
after casting their eyes over some of
the recognised Asian hell-holes).
Thursday Island, you feel, must have
been named on one of Captain Cook’s
off days. It’s flanked by Wednesday and
Friday Islands and looks out one way
to Prince of Wales Island and the other
way to Horn Island.
Either Captain Cook slipping or
else he thought that the flyspeck islands
were hardly worth giving the names of
solid and substantial people.
But close to a century later, the
white man thought differently and
started a settlement on Thursday
Island. He had two reasons.' Firstly,
T.I. has a harbor sheltered from most
winds. Secondly, no one lived there
the local natives regarding it as dry
and worthless. The native name for
the place was Waiben, meaning “dry-
place,”, and even today water is a
problem. In many dry seasons restric-
tions are necessary, because the town
depends on an artificial catchment,
pitifully small for its population, which
is about twice as big as the original
storage was built for. Because of these
w'ater restrictions, nobody bothers about
a garden.
Most visitors nowadays fly in by the

once the heart of Torres Strait, now a
refuge for a few luggers and boats
which lands at nearby Horn Island.
You go through a fantastic comedy of
transhipment of baggage and passengers,
from plane to bus to boat to truck
before you eventually find your w'ay to
one of the island’s four pubs.
In the town, pearling is still a major
source of livelihood. Island-owned
luggers for the most part go out to get
the pearl-shell oysters, which Japanese
technicians •wall irritate with grit to
make cultured pearls at several “farms”
on neighboring islands and on Cape
York. Arnold Duffield, general manager
of a group of companies, with names
like Cape York Pearling Co. Pty. Ltd.,
told me there are three culture farms
in a big w r ay, in which both Japanese
and Australians have interests.
Another industry connected with the
sea is prawn and fish processing.
John Newton, who runs the $lOO,OOO
factory which provides work for some
80 local women, told me he believes
Thursday Island might establish itself
as a major fishing port. His group
plans a $250,000 investment. Proces-
sors are discussing with the islanders
plans for putting small freezers on out-
lying islands so that the local people
would be able to fish and store the
catch in lots of a ton or more until
a regular boat called to collect it. This
would provide the island groups with
a source of regular income and an
occupation without leaving home.
Newton believes prawn and fish proces-
sing might mean big changes on
Thursday Island. He thinks the royster-
ing atmosphere of a fishing port could
lead to serious trouble and that the
big money that women are able to
earn while island men are unable to
find comparable work might cause
social upsets.
The other major source of income on
Thursday Island appears to be from
social service payments. The illegitimacy
rate is very high. When you "talk to
church people and Government people
you get shoulder-shrugging stories of
baby-borrowing to boost incomes, but
no one seems seriously to be concerned.
The Department of Island and
Aboriginal Affairs, with its wide
responsibilities throughout Cape York
and the islands, has a . big emple
stretching from T.I. Radio links join
it with settlements up and down the
Peninsula and through the Straits;
there are island boats and luggers to
carry supplies, and a college for 35
island boys in the town itself. As part
of its responsibilities, the Department
has created a trading complex, the
Island Industries Board, which has a
turnover of more than Si million a
year.
It ships stores at the rate of 50 to-
-80 tons a week out as far as Boigu
Island, 90 miles to the west, to Murray
Island, 120 miles to the east, and to
Weipa, 150 miles to the south on the
Peninsula mainland. It has a main
department store on Thursday Island
and 21 branches scattered through the
area. The secretary, Mr. Reg Maguire,
is a former Brisbane accountant who
hankered for something more'adventur-
ous than his Queen Street office and
took on the islands appointment.
i: We handle everything from babies’
booties to coffins,” he told me. “Coffins,
suitably engraved, are a big item. They
cost around $l5O to $l6O landed in the
islands. We have also found the island
women are getting fashion conscious.
More and more of the girls are getting
away to schools, or see the clothes worn
by teachers who come to live on theip
islands. You’ll find mini-skirts and
foundation garments in most of our
shops, even in the most remote places.”
These are the sort of influences now
beginning to be felt throughout the
Torres Strait area. While many of the
islanders may choose to stay at home
for a life of subsistence gardening and
fishing and others might be content to
make the odd dollar here and there
until they qualify for social security
pensions, many more want a slice of
the good things of life.
They have shown they are not afraid
to migrate and face the big world.
Australians might even see them become
not only a growing minority in the
major cities but also as a significant
political force in the north, wooed and
respected by State and Federal parties.


The Sydney region—a
nation of seven million
WHILE TALKING about what things
will be like in A.D. 2000 has become
one of the pastimes of American intel-
lectuals, discussion has been slow to
start in Australia. Now that it is start-
ing, however, it is characteristically
taking the preliminary form of forecasts
of highway construction and the elabora-
tion of water, sewerage, and drainage
plans.
Even when the State Planning
Authority of N.S.W. released its “Out-
line Plan on the Sydney Region, A.D.
1970-2000,” the main things that seemed
to create instant discussion were where
the expressways and airports would be,
what greenbelt releases might occur,
how property values might rise. But in
the Outline Plan itself there were the
beginnings of a wider horizon.
Previously, the State Planning
Authority had taken a stodgy view of
the future and a highly localised view
©f what it meant by Sydney. It would
only be a bit of an exaggeration to say
that its thoughts for the future of
Sydney (which is to say the future of
more than a fifth of Australians) did
not go much beyond cramming as many
people as it could into the areas away
from the coast, between the present
Sydney and the Great Dividing Range.
When that area filled up, it looked as
if that was to be the end of Sydney.
Its newly released Outline Plan
(completed after four years of the
Authority’s existence) still shows evi-
dence of such thinking. It is only about
the area west of the present Sydney
that the Plan becomes at all specific,
but the authors of the Plan must have
been looking at a map lately, because
they also speak—for the first time—of
the “clbsely related urban complex” of
Newcastle-Wollongong-Sydney, and, to
fill in the emptiest bit in the map of
this complex, they have created in their
imagination (although with no detail)
the concept of a 500,000-population city
where Gosford and Wyong now are.
Their feelings about this new creation
still seem uneasy. They forgot to put
the new Gosford on the map in which
they showed the future principal cities
of the N.S.W. Central Coast, and they
did not even begin to discuss how the
new Gosford might get there. They
still speak of a plan for a “Sydney
region,” which excludes Newcastle and
Wollongong, and we do not yet know
even how many more people they
Imagine living in these other two urban
regions (each of which is already bigger
than Hobart). But the significance of
such questions is indicated at the very
beginning of the Outline Plan, when
it forecasts a population of six to seven
million for the
Newcastle - Sydney-
Wollongong com-
plex. A population
of six to seven mil-
lion could provide
the basis for a new
nation.
It is understand-
able that, since the
State Planning
Authority has the
immediate problem
of deciding where
houses should go in
the next decade or
so, the most obvious
and cheapest answer
is to put them into
the present Syd-
ney’s backyard
especially since
stingey Federal
policies starve
N.S.W. of funds.
But to speak of the
year A.D. 2000 is
to speak in the wider context of an
affluent post-industrial “technectronic”
society in which the problems of pro-
duction are solved and questions of
quality of life can be taken more
seriously. The particular quality of life
that the Central Coast of N.S.W. offers
Australia and immigrants to Aus-
tralia is an opportunity to combine
the amenities of an urban environment
with the pleasures of coastal waters in
a way that is probably not going to
be offered by any other urban complex
in the world—a hundred surfing beaches
and Port Stephens, Port Hunter, Lake
Macquarie, Tuggerah Lakes, Brisbane
Water, Broken Bay, Pittwater, Port
Jackson, Botany Bay, Port Hacking,
and Port Kembla, too, along with five
huge national parks.
Whatever necessary improvisations
they make for 1980, it is this region as
a whole that the planners should now
be considering when they plan for the
year 2000, not bits and pieces of it in
isolation. Indeed, to plan it properly
they must also think of its extensions—
the Hunter Valley, running west of
Newcastle and providing one of the
most diversified areas in Australia, and
the North and South Coasts, which,
with fast access, could become the
principal recreation and retirement
areas for the urban population of seven
million.
The perceptive Sydney town planner,
Mr. George Clarke, has gone one
further, and he is probably right. He
sees a large part of the east coast of
Australia, from Townsville to Eden,
as a “lineal coastal metropolis,"
based on a series of ports and with a
proper north-south axis. As things stand
at present, this involves an urban plan-
ning concept far beyond present
attitudes —it would even involve
co-operation between two States but
it seems more aligned to the future
than the usual present attitudes, which
tend to do little more than project the
past.
As we move into the post-industrial
society, we move into a new world in

horrors of New York, Tokyo, or London,
With forethought now they need never

of how comfortable one can be, though
urban, that decisions will be made by
many of the immigrants of the future.

and clouds such efforts. The facile solu-
tion now is to brand the very principle
of swing-wing aircraft as economically
unviable and call it a day. It is a
solution which is gaining ground to the
further detriment of the situation. But
the fact remains that both France and
the U.S.S.R. have apparently successful
swing-wings in the air. The Mirage G
of Avions Marcel Dassault put in a
remarkable appearance after some 12
months of development work (a meta-
morphosis of the Mirage F-l and F-2)
in June last year, since when it has
been put through more than 50 success-
ful test flights. What, then, has been
dogging the progress of the F-lll?
Certainly, General Dynamics’ achieve-
ments have been both dismal and dis-
heartening. Eleven F-l 11s have crashed
in the two and a half years the aircraft
has been flying. The F-11l has been
grounded, cleared for flight, and
grounded again four times in rapid—
too rapid—succession. Because it is one
of the biggest single items in America’s
defence budget, and has escaped the
five percent defence cuts more or less
unscathed, the F-11l program is being
attacked by all the other parts of the
armed services, whose own appropria-
tions have been slashed. If the aircraft
has any friends, they are finding it
hard to make their voices heard.
The latest attack has been launched
by the U.S. Assistant Secretary of
Defence, Dr. Alain C. Enthoven, whose
new cut-back proposal is reckoned to
put total production into the 500-or-
less bracket instead of the 1700 origin-
ally planned. The U.S. Air Force
rallied, as usual, to the defence of the
plane, but even their energy now seems
to be flagging. The program, nonethe-
less, continues.
Boeing’s swing-wing supersonic pro-
ject has not survived. When this
aircraft was chosen early last year, in
preference to Lockheed’s fixed delta, it
had already been radically redesigned,
once, and needed at least a year’s
further work before the company was
going to be in a position to start build-
ing a prototype. The year dragged into
18 months, until Boeing publicly
admitted that the aircraft had become
so heavy that, instead of the 350 seats
once proposed, it would probably have
a capacity below 130 passengers. Work
on the Boeing aircraft has stopped.
The swing-wing is now being blamed
for having put weight up to impossible
levels: specifically because the pivot on
which the wing swings had to be moved
some way out from the fuselage and
the stiff main structure in order to
clear the engines. It was the stiffening
that had to be built into what would
normally be a relatively flexible part
of the aircraft which added the extra
tons to what was already a 300-ton
design. But to say that this difficulty
provides an open-and-shut case against
the swing-wing principle is an easy
counsel of despair. The pivoting wing
is, and will continue to be, the neatest
and, in the long run, most promising
way of getting heavy, fast aircraft in
and out of relatively confined spaces—
supersonic airliners out of existing air-
ports, bombers off rough air-strips,
strike aircraft off carriers.
While Boeing’s and General
Dynamics’ world was falling around
their ears, the Ling-Temco-Vought Cor-
poration of Dallas, Texas, landed a
special know-how agreement with
Dassault on swing-dbngs in September.
And the British, stung by what they
called the perfidy of the French move
(it was Dassault which opted out of
the Anglo-French swing-wing project,
pleading financial reasons) have become
more determined than ever about the
currently proposed joint project with
Germany, Italy, and Holland, with
Belgium and Canada possibly joining in
later.
The F-11l is an aircraft at the far
frontier of modern technological
development, and not only because of
its swinging wing. It is still unclear
what is mainly wrong with it, as faults
recur in so many places. First, thd
engines give trouble; then Small hyd-
raulic components; then the wheels;
then a crack is discovered in plates
carrying the pivots; and so on. There
is no pattern and no single cause. The
circumstantial evidence is piling up for
an indictment of sloppy workmanship.
Unfortunately, the Fort Worth plant is
reluctant to accept that anything is
wrong at all. The furious criticism of
the F-11l is treated there merely as
part of the anti-Texas campaign carried
on intermittently by the rest of the
United States ever since President
Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.
This is not the best atmosphere in which
to hold an internal inquest or to tighten
up! production control and factory
discipline so that accusations of faulty
work cannot be levelled at General
Dynamics and its sub-contractors again.
The American Air Force, which has
stayed reasonably loyal to the F-111,
has not helped by seizing an early
excuse to rush the aircraft back into
combat each time it has been grounded.
There is no doubt now that, partly
because everyone’s nerves were over-
strained by the political campaigning
that has dogged the aircraft’s develop-
ment, the F-11l went to Vietnam at


far too early a stage in its flight testing
and has been kept in service when
wiser counsel would have been to
ground it for an indefinite period. But,
throughout all the disappointments,
neither the wing nor the pivot itself
has given trouble.
The conclusion this leads up to is
that the swinging part of the swing-
wing is easy to build and works reliably,
But it raises design problems over other
parts of the aircraft that are inade-
quately understood. Because Boeing and
General Dynamics concentrated so hard
on the swing parts, they may have
overlooked this—General Dynamics in
particular.
MEN AND MATTERS
ANNOUNCEMENT of a $4 million
timber and wood chip project by ANG
Holdings Ltd. was another milestone
for Steven Rich, the naturalised
Australian who was born in Frankfurt
in 1926 of German parents, brought up
in England, and spent 12 years in the
U.S., hence his American-accented
English.
A New York University graduate in
economics and psychology, he joined
Hunter Douglas, the international
organisation headquartered in New
York, in 1946, as a management trainee.
In 1953, at the age of 27, Rich was
sent to Australia after imposition of
import restrictions here, to set up local
operations for Hunter Douglas Ltd.,
aluminium processer, best known for its
Luxaflex window coverings. Rich was
recalled two years later to become
executive vice-president in charge of all
operations.
His fluency in German, French, and
Dutch was useful in the next six years,
spent travelling the world looking after
all Hunter Douglas operations.
Acquisition of a wife from Ballarat
Sir William Barnes Steven Rich
propelled him back to Australia in
1962. He decided to diversify his inter-
ests, and by 1964, Rich and seven other
prominent Australian businessmen
formed Australia New Guinea Corpora-
tion, with original capital of mil-
lion, to attract and develop investment
in Papua and New Guinea. His
interest in Eastern New Guinea
stemmed from a stay in Holland at the
time of Sukarno’s claims to West New
Guinea.
Development of the territory’s
natural assets of timber, tea, and coffee
were primary objects, but the current
development takes ANG into the stage
of secondary industry. Through Jardine
Matheson and Gollin, exclusive agents
in the Far East and Australia respec-
tively, the company aims to sell sawn
timber and logs to Australia, and logs
only to Japan, which will be peeled
for plywood. The operation will be
based on timber resources near
McFarlane Harbor, 100 miles south-
east of Port Moresby.
Perhaps 80 percent of Rich’s working
time is devoted to New Guinea
interests (he goes up for week-long
stays about every six weeks), the rest
to a private travel agency, and to
Studio Australia, a recently launched
venture to promote Australian designed
and crafted wall decor. And, of course,
he is still deputy chairman of Hunter
Douglas.
ALL THIS bother about the Avis
airport’s franchise couldn’t have
happened in Britain, where the rules
about politicians (but not stockbrokers)
out of company boardrooms are stricter
than they are here. As for civil servants
crossing the bridge into the business
world, there has been some increase in
the traffic in both countries in recent
years, but mostly flowing from the trade
departments which, in Australia, has
left the second-line jobs in the Depart-
ment of Trade much easier to come by.
Mostly, though, top civil servants prefer
to leave the transition to the graceful
days of their retirement. After being
awarded their knighthoods and taking
up their directorships, it usually isn’t
too long before British civil servants
discover that their adopted companies
have subsidiaries operating in serene
climates on the other side of the world
that simply must be visited.
One of the most urbane of retired
British civil servants to arrive here in
business guise recently is Sir William
Gorel Barnes, who, after spending most
of his working life in the diplomatic
service and the Treasury, was in 1948
seconded to the Colonial Office as
Deputy Under Secretary of State and
in the next dozen years became a
leading light in the biggest liquidation
of a colonial empire the world has
yet witnessed. Having succeeded in
piloting a host of colonies to their
independence, he then became a notable
figure in Britain’s unsuccessful attempt
to hitch up with the Common Market.
Sir William’s main object in coming
here is to visit Carpet Manufacturers
in Sydney and Tasman Carpet
Manufacturing in Tasmania (a com-
pany which came into his orbit in
July this year when James Templeton,
the Scottish carpetmaker, of which
he has been chairman since last year,
merged with Gray’s Carpet and Tex-
tiles, which owns all the shares in
Tasman Scottish). He has quite a
string of directorships in U.K. com-
panies out here, including the Royal
Insurance Co. and Doulton and Co.,
as well as being a director of Carpet
Manufacturers. His visit timed in
nicely with the latter company’s
annual meeting in Sydney last week,
where Sir William could warm to the
more optimistic sales notes struck by
the chairman, Mr. T. G. Rowe, and
to the company’s better prospect in
the growing tufted trade stemming
from the installation of new machinery
in that division aimed to make it more
versatile. j
FOREIGN INVESTMENT
A PATRIOT REVILED
PREDICTABLY, Australia’s somewhat
brash gestures toward more economic
independence has drawn its overseas
critics, not least that arbiter of informed
British opinion on matters monetary,
the “Economist.” The new economic
nationalism, from this side of the world,
may well be seen as a perfectly normal
stage of development. At least, as the
Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, sounded very
reasonable about it all last week: “It is
essential that we do not place real
impediments upon the movement of
overseas capital into Australia. But I do
emphasise that we do increasingly
desire Australian participation in both
the management and the equity owner-
ship of enterprise here. I am sure over-
seas interest understands such an
attitude well.” And well it might,
although its accusations of “chauvinism”
hardly go hand-in-hand with attitudes
of friendly understanding, while ideas
of a “jingoistic” Prime Minister with
all its implications of blustering
patriotic gibberish can hardly add
favorably to Australia’s image of a
safe country for foreign investment. For
the “Economist,” anyway, the capital-
hungry economy and commonsense
which have combined to produce a
firmly liberal attitude here has never
been quite the same since Mr. Gorton’s
rise to power.
It is now more than a month since
Mr. Gorton rallied to the cause of MLC
Ltd., and, ever since, a string of denials
that the Government’s attitude toward
overseas investment has changed has
been chanted out with the persistence
of a parrot. The fact remains, however,
that the Government has chosen to act
against portfolio investment here by an
old-established British financial institu-
tion the Sun Alliance and London
Assurance Co., a British-based, world-
wide composite office with a 20 percent
stake in the MLC, as it now turns out.
The A.C.T. Companies Ordinance
has, after some difficulty, been drafted.
Specifically aimed at preventing any
overseas-based takeover of the MLC it
is generally framed to make nominee
shareholders in life-m mrance companies
reveal to the Insurance Commissioner
the identity of the beneficial owners of


AIR FARES
JET-SET JOKE
DISCONCERTING RUMORS have
been hovering around the International
Air Transport Association’s meeting in
Cannes that airliners are actually con-
sidering putting up fares by something
like 5 percent, a difficult move to justify
when operating costs, as measured by
the International Civil Aviation Organ-
isation, fell nearly 7 percent last year—
operating costs for Qantas fell 9.5 per-
cent, but then Qantas had a whopping
deficit for 1966-67 goading it on.
An increase is even harder to justify
when it is timed to run during the
period in which the first jumbo jets
are coming into service, with costs
nominally a third below those of today’s
best aircraft. Even if the full savings
are not realised straight off, either
because fewer seats are installed than
the aircraft can hold, or for technical
reasons, they must still have the effect
of holding costs down rather than put-
ting them up.
Some of the proposals that have
been tabled at Cannes were quite openly
for imposing a 10 to 15 percent sur-
charge on the big jets, not because
this was needed to cover their costs
but because they would otherwise look
too comfortable to passengers tired of
being crammed in today’s 34in. tourist
seats (lATA regulations prescribe the
size).
It was a somewhat vindictive reaction
to Boeing’s happy announcement that
the jumbo size of the 747, the first of
the giants to go into service, was going
to allow airlines to offer tourist passen-
gers the standard of seating previously
confined to the first-class section. This
is exactly what a sizable number of
airlines are trying to prevent, either
because they are low on the jumbo
delivery lists or because they have too
many large and unamortised conven-
tional jets.
Such soured surcharge proposals are
not likely to survive, simply because
they would not receive American Gov-
ernment approval. But the discontents
won a point, also, by quashing the
sensible suggestion that jumbos carry-
ing the maximum seats (490 on a
the shares, and to restrict the holdings
of persons who are not resident in
Australia. Even so, the Attorney-
General’s Department is not at all
happy that it has come up with a
foolproof mechanism. Other forms of
company constructions to hide the
identity of the real shareholders are
not too difficult to conjure up.
Come what may, the “Economist”
remains convinced that the spark struck
by a jingoistic Prime Minister, and the
panic of a large and indifferently run
life company seeking permanent
security from competitive challenge
through foreign, takeover has lit what
could well be fanned up into a very
destructive fire indeed.
Speculator’s Diary
THE BELLS ARE RINGING
AND THEY MAY BE
SIGNALLING A BOTTOM
THE TINKLING SOUND in investors’
ears last week may have been the noise
made by the breaking of the last thin,
delicate vestiges of market confidence
as mining shares collapsed once
again. But to me it sounded more like
the mythical bell that is supposed to
ring when prices hit bottom. Some
shares are still at too high a price in
relation to their real prospects, I’ll
admit, and could fall further. Most of
the leading mining and oil stocks, how-
ever, are now fairly realistically priced
in terms of their likely future. And it
just needs a bit of good news to make
the market realise that some of them
may be even underpriced, not merely
on prospects but also on what is already
known about them.
Starting with Woodside, the reality is
that prices down at 94c seem too low
purely in terms of its assets backing,
let alone its oil-search potential. There
is probably $1 a share worth of natural
gas already indicated from Woodside’s
Golden Beach reserves. And there are
more than 30c a share in its cash and
investments. Then there are its con-
tinuing prospects offshore from Western
Australia still good despite its two
disappointments.
Metals Exploration is not such a
clear-cut case, but there seems every
chance that the company will soon
report that it is going ahead with a
nickel project at Greenvale and possibly
also at Nepean, despite Cominco’s aban-
doning of its nearby area. (It is worth
remembering that Western Mining Cor-
poration once relinquished the Scotia
area where Great Boulder and North
Kalgurli are now doing so well.) The
price of Metals Exploration shares has
been cut in half in the past few weeks.
For Ampol Petroleum, the market has
pushed its 50c shares down from their
high point of $1.76 a short while ago
to recent prices around $1.25 following
the market’s general downturn and the
special problem of the oil incentiveness.
But Ampol, through Wapet, is to con-
tinue receiving the incentive until Sep-
tember, 1970, and after that the Gov-
ernment appears to be considering the
idea of a further incentive to producers
like Ampol and AOG. In any event, it
seems likely that Ampol Petroleum will
be earning about 8c a share next finan-
cial year, which gives it a price/earnings
ratio at current prices of only 16 times,
fairly modest in view of the significant
potential for further oil discoveries
through the Wapet group. In addition
the stock could well receive a bit of a
boost when the profits for the year to
September, 1968, are released next
month. It will probably have been an
excellent year for Ampol, and there is
yevery promise that the current financial
year will be likewise, quite apart from
its oil production revenues. Then there
is the added sweetener of Ampol’s con-
siderable role in the search for minerals
in Australia; there seems to be at least
one area in which the company is associ-
ated with Pickands Mather and North
Broken Hill which is very promising
indeed. I bought 400.
The mining sectqr is not the only
lively part of the market right now.
Last week’s news on the sugar agree-
ment ought to bring significant bene-
fits to the sugar millers as the 10
percent cut in production next year
from the base seems certain to be
followed by a more than proportionate
rise in prices on the free market where
about half of Australia’s production is
sold. In practice, the new arrangements
suggest that Australian production will
fall back to a little below 1967 levels,
following this year’s 13 percent rise due
to the excellent season, or roughly back
to mill peaks. So the expected doubling
in export prices from last year’s average
of £stgl9 a ton to up around £stg3B
a ton (or a bit better than the
minimum level of £stg.36, below which
production cuts will apply) should
bring in an income rise of around $3O
million to the industry, of which one
third will go to the millers and two
thirds to the growers. Out of this the
industry could probably pay back $6
million or so a year of its Common-
wealth borrowings of $23 million. Com-
panies like Fairymead Sugar that also
grow some of their own sugar will get
the benefits both ways. So Fairymead,
which mills about 3 percent of the
industry’s cane, should get an extra
$240,000 a year pre-tax as a miller and
about the same amount from its large
growing operations, giving it a net
increase of about $275,000 or an
extra 46 percent on to 1967 profits.
In 1967 it earned at the rate of 17
percent to capital and paid a 7 percent
dividend; both those rates seem likely
to be healthily increased if this new
sugar agreement works out as well as
it promises to.
This leaves kitty at $3653.

When it comes to
making sure an operator
can handle one
of our giants
The earthmoving and mining machines we
market are no more difficult to operate than
other people’s. But a control lever on one of
these machines can be moved one way and
you get average response. Or move it another
way and you’re heading towards bigger pro-
fits. That’s why we have specially trained men
available at our training school (or on-site, if
necessary) for the sole purpose of making
sure that your operator always gets the most
out of the machine he is operating.
By doing this and also concentrating on parts
and service, we ensure that the equipment
we supply gives performance and productivity
that’s always at its peak.
This is an essential part of WABCO’s efficient
organisation throughout Australia. In every
capital city there’s a team of factory trained
personnel supported by manufacturers’ tech-
nicians and these in turn backed by a nation-
wide teleprinter system and computerized
parts supply system. As a subsidiary of the
Westinghouse Air Brake Company, U.S.A.,
WABCO in Australia can draw on the experi-
ence of a company that serves governments
and industries in 55 countries. WABCO is
always there. Whether it’s simply to deliver
a king-pin or be certain that an operator
knows how to make one of our machines
produce the giant results you expect.
We’ll be there

charge less than those with fewer seats
because they were, firstly, less comfort-
able and, secondly, cheaper to operate.
Before governments approve the fare
package that is expected to come out
of Cannes in the next week or so, they
should ask the airlines to produce not
only their reasons but the costs on
which they are based. The rule that all
fares must be unanimous tends to
make lATA move at the speed of the
slowest member, and the handful of
big airlines that used to act as a ginger
group seem in the years of prosperity
to have lost their bite. It is no excuse
to argue, as airlines sometimes do, that
air fares have risen much more slowly
than other prices, and in real terms
have fallen sharply. In a rapidly advan-
cing technology, this is just what one
would expect.
FINE ART MARKET
SALTY STATISTICS
THE INTERNATIONAL fine-art
trade is certainly very big business, with
an annual turnover now measured in
hundreds of millions of dollars. But
there are considerable pitfalls and dis-
appointments in store for those who
take the business side of it too literally.
English silver with a 60 percent
price increase, French impressionist
paintings 52 percent, Old Master prints
42 percent, and glass 40 percent were
the major growth stocks on the world’s
“art market” last year according to
figures recently released by Sotheby’s,
the London auctioneers.
In terms of capital appreciation, these
are impressive, indeed. But compared
with the average growth rate in price
over the past 18 years, it becomes
obvious that the cream has already been
lifted from the market, mostly in the
late ’fifties and early ’sixties. Thus,
French impressionists have had an
average yearly growth rate of 83 per-
cent, and Old Master prints an incred-
ible 141 percent. Silver has averaged
53 percent so that a growth rate of
60 percent last year seems a healthy
sign. However, the price rise coincided
with the world’s monetary crisis and a
period in which the price of silver
doubled on the bullion market; the
fact that many Victorian silver extrava-
ganzas seldom sell for more than their
weight in silver has obviously added
considerably to the rise. Of the top
four, glass, with an average annual
growth rate of 47 percent, must be
reckoned to have put up the most
healthy performance last year; and
Chinese porcelain, with a growth rate
of 9 percent last year compared with
an average of 86 percent, the worst.
The attempts of Sotheby’s, in col-
laboration with “The Times,” to submit
the world of fine art to the techniques
ofi the statisticians must be taken with
a very large pinch of salt, anyway. The
price of any object is determined by
so many subjective factors—condition,

Whether the price of any two “similar”
objects can be compared is wide open
to dispute. Sotheby’s warn that signifi-
cance should not be read into small
differences.
Between 1961 and 1967, the U.S.
jazz impresario Mr. Norman Granz
spent $1 million on a collection
of modern European paintings of the
first class. According to the Sotheby’s
indexes, this school of painting appreci-
ated by a remarkable 1200 percent over
that period, so that Mr. Granz could
have expected to have netted at least
$4 million and perhaps $6 million this
year. At Sotheby’s in April, his pictures
fetched just over $1.5 million. A profit
of $600,000 is not to be sniffed at,
none the less.
FRENCH ECONOMIC MISSION
SUMMONED BY DRUMS
HOT ON THE HEELS of Federal
Treasurer William McMahon, who is
himself still warm from the recent
exertions of drumming up financial
interest in Europe, comes confirmation
of his assurances that on the Continent
there is indeed a rapidly growing
interest in investing in Australia.
In times of gaping trade deficits, the
economic mission relentlessly intent on
the hard-sell is a difficult sort of visi-
tor to feel enthusiastic about. It is a
clumsy way of going about things at
the best of times. Trade should at
least appear to be a two-way affair
to mutual advantage; markets should be
satisfied rather than created; a little
interest in buying should leaven any
preoccupation with selling.
Happily, the French economic
mission which arrived here last week-
end for a three-week tour of inspection
through all States has the broadest of
intentions. Embracing some of France’s
most important companies in the fields
of banking, industry, engineering, and
trade, it is on the lookout for oppor-
tunities of setting up permanent estab-
lishments in Australia. Of course,
France is interested in boosting her
exports here; but joint ventures, co-
operation agreements, and financial
participation in existing local projects
are on the mission’s agenda also.
All of which is not to say that a new
entente is about to be forged. But,
the interest in investment could well
turn out to be the turning point in
Australian-French economic relations,
which until now have been largely a
disinterested exchange of goods.
ASPROS ALL ROUND
OUT OF THE FAMILY
THE TRANSLATION' OF family
proprietaries to public status, as in the
case of the coming listing of Nicholas
Pty. Ltd., which has in its keeping all
the Aspro and allied pharmaceutical
business in this part of the world (but
nowhere else), is usually resisted and
delayed too long in most cases simply
because families who build up busi-
nesses, big or small, can’t bear the
thought of losing control. And this
seems to apply however many financial
and other headaches life in the re-
stricted proprietary role may be giving
them.
The original Nicholas brothers who
discovered Aspro in 1915 and gave so
many benefactions around Melbourne
(they financed the rebuilding of Wesley
College in sickly yellow between the
wars) died a long time ago. Their off-
spring have scattered Maurice to
Britain, where, since the war, he’s built
up an Aspro company with vast inter-
national business (not with the Pacific
region, where the Australian company
holds all franchises) and with a present
market capitalisation of around
£stg,l2s million. A nucleus of the off-
spring and their children has, however,
stayed nearer Jolimont, where the local
company has its headquarters. Up to
now they’ve kept their own counsel
closely, but obviously the heat of com-
petition, especially from international
ethical drug companies and other
pain-relieving tablet pedlars, and the
urge to extend into other pharma-
ceutical fields, have become increasingly
difficult to accommodate as a pro-
prietary. And, after all, it is that when
the details of the float are known, the
family control (as in the case of so
many others) will not be all that much
impaired.
NEW ZEALAND
A RIVAL IN TRADE
IF PRESENT OMENS prove correct,
Australia could well be losing to New
Zealand some of its current $2OO million
South Pacific export trade. N.Z.’s Trade
Commissioner for the South Pacific
Islands (excluding New Guinea) Mr.
McLaren has just descended on Fiji
after an examination of trade prospects
in New Caledonia. Figures for the
latest statistical quarter show a 100
percent increase in N.Z. exports to
Fiji, which, if continued for the rest of
the year, would mean an annual trade
of $8 million.
Total N.Z. exports to the islands are
valued at $lO million and prospects in
New Caledonia alone could help to
increase it further. There are a number
of New Zealand goods which cost less
to produce than Australian. This factor,
combined with roughly comparable
freight costs between Auckland and
Sydney to Noumea, and the recent
initiation of regular shipping services
between New Zealand and New
Caledonia, could mean an early increase
in trade which New Zealand’s economy
could greatly benefit from.
The single biggest hurdle to Island
trade, which Australia overcame years
ago, is regular freight services and
sufficient volume of trade to sustain
them.


Assignment for a company of uncommon enterprise:
Water
for a thirsty
valley.
Over 600 miles of mountain, forest and des-
ert lie between California’s thirsty cities
in the south and the rain-rich mountains
in the north. To link the two, California
launched the largest water development
program in history. Dravo’s assignment:
dig 4.7 miles of tunnel through an earth-
quake racked mountainous area.
At the Carley V. Porter Tunnel two crews
drive simultaneously toward each other
from opposite sides of the Tehachapi
Mountains. Two hundred ton cylindrical
shields, twenty-four feet in diameter are
forced through the earth, guarding the
crew from the unstable ground. To keep
the two crews in correct alignment, laser
beams are focused toward the break-
through point from each end of the tunnel.
As a result the work progresses, with con-
siderable savings in man power, toward
completion in 1969.
Underground work utilizes only a few of
Dravo’s skills: engineering, project man-
agement and construction. Your need may
be for other capabilities such as develop-
ment of a water treatment system, design
and manufacture of a bulk materials han-
dling system, or the design of an oxygen
steelmaking installation.
To learn more about Dravo, you are in-
vited to read the REVIEW, a quarterly
magazine. You may receive copies by writ-
ing Dravo Pty. Ltd., 30 Ord Street, Perth or

BRIEFLY
The economy: Mr. McMahon, the Federal Treasurer,
believes “the guidelines on foreign equity are simple
and clear enough” and reinforces his belief by adding,
“We are hungry for capital” ... In direct
contradiction, Mr. J. Campbell Johnston, of J. B. Were and
Son, is convinced that Government policies are “vague”
and that “it is difficult to discover any clear-cut
official policy concerning either the foreign ownership
of local companies or the fund-raising activities
within Australia of foreign-owned companies.”
The September quarter displayed good growth in the
production of consumer durables, bricks and
cement among building materials, and wool cloth and
synthetic fibre among textiles . . . The six capital cities
consumer price index rose by only 0.4 percent
during the September quarter.
The new International Sugar Agreement .means heavy
cuts in production for Australia and a presumed
much higher price on the free market; so’me doubts have
been expressed about its long-term success.
The morketS : The general weakness of the Australian
sharemarkets has continued with a vengeance, and
so far has provided no signs of any reversal in
the overall tone. Leaders still suffer with the rest.
That is clearly enough shown by BHP’s 85c drop
to $17.85 and an emphatic retreat within the
miners. The falls included: Hamersley $12.40 (down 20c),
GRA $lB.OO ($1.40), Mount Isa $7.26 (41c), Western
Mining $10.70 ($1.20), Great Boulder $9.10 ($1.80),
and Peko $9.80 ($1.15). King Island Scheelite
stood against the trend by adding $1.60 to hit $12.70.
Captain Products repeated its cli’mb, gaining 30c to
close at $3.00. Bank of New South Wales put on 90c and
finished at $7.30. CSR eased back 6c to $5.10.
Some depression has struck London, where leaders
have fallen on fears of fresh credit curbs.
Late trading produced a slight upswing for Wall Street
on Friday, mainly deriving from Vietnam hopes;
turnovers were moderate.
Companies: It was nice to see a few of the “industrials”
going part of the way toward upstaging the ever-so-
prominent tniners . . . Out came the Bank of New
South Wales with a 32 percent jump in profit (from
$10,691,619 to $14,142,000), an 11 percent dividend
decorated with a one percent “special bonus,”
and a one-for-four share issue at a $1.25 pre’mium which
will raise $22,750,000 . . . The veteran island trader
and investor W. R. Carpenter pushed its dividend up
brightly from 16 to 18 percent after an 1 L|- percent
profit advance to a record $4,985,344, despite
devaluation losses . . . While in the vicinity of Papua,
ANG Holdings, together with a collection of Australian and
Hong Kong partners, is to develop 'a $4 million
timber-processing project and wood-chip mill in Papua
“within the next three years” . . . On top of a
“marked increase” in overall activity, Development
Finance Corporation made a $1 .million share placement
and will disgorge the whole of its share premium
reserve by a two-for-five bonus; the 1967-68 profit was
.almost steady at $578,900, and a steady 12£ percent payout
accompanied it . . . Co’ming partly into the daylight, the
Nicholas Pty. “Aspro” group is shortly to make
a public issue.
Retailers, as usual, weren’t backward, either ... By
taking over the Victorian Lindsays chain of softgoods
stores, Myer Emporium proposes to expand this
group and establish “a national chain of high-volume,
low-margin retail stores”; Woolworth and Coles to look out!
. . . Myers got a dividend of $2,315,250 from its
Sydney offshoot, Farmers (Holdings) $405,354 more
than Farmers’ latest profit ... In Adelaide, John Martin
sent profit up from $903,954 to $950,004.
Back to the miners, which are ceaseless in activity . . .
The battle for King Island Scheelite has been
rejoined, as expected, by Consolidated Gold Fields Australia
again after a for’mal 50 percent of KIS by offering
two of its $1 shares plus $1 cash for each KIS
50-cent share; this bid is well ahead of the current
value of Peko-Wallsend’s one-for-one offer; CGFA had
already bought 15 percent of KIS . . . Peko itself is
examining the possibilities of extending its
Northern Territory ,copper-gold operations into, smelting;
it will also adopt a bigger re-equipment plan for
Mount Morgan . . . Kambalda-St. Ives is yielding new
nickel orebodies for Western Mining Corporation,
but the company’s policy of not calculating a full reserves
figure is still being followed . . . Lack of a
Government line on tin export restrictions and on
devaluation compensation is hindering Ardlelhan Tin.
Much of H. C. Sleigh’s 1967-68 profit rise stemmed
from a 9.1 percent growth in petroleum products sales,
but the group is concerned at the increase in
pri,me cost which will come with the buying of
Australian crudes at “inflated prices” . . .
Motor vehicle distributor Larke Consolidated ’may face
a lower profit for the current 1968-69 year as it
seeks to find uses for funds derived from the sale of
the 70 percent owned Pressed Metal Corporation.
Plywood maker Ralph Symonds is on profits again after
five years of losses $137,214 for the year to June
following the immediately previous $87,183 loss . . .
Cemac, on the other hand, posted record sales but saw
profit droop by $38,174 to $392,541 as a consequence
of an unprofitable fabricating venture.

Keep
an eye
on the
time line
In slalom competition,
the clock crowns the
winner. But experts say
that, with a knowing eye,
you can beat the clock.
Their advice: “Watch the. time
line, the speediest course line.
If the skier slips off and goes too low
in traverses, he’ll lose precious seconds.”
“Notice the excellent form of this skier. He
stays close to the poles, close to the time line.
And he swings through the gate in championship fashion.”
That’s the experts’ advice. And we’ve taken it ourselves.
We’re keeping an eye on the time line, too.
With expansion and modernisation'programmes, we’re keeping
ahead of future bearing needs. At Timken Research, the largest
Research and Development Centre in the industry, engineers
and scientists smooth the way into that future with
innovations that prevent time-taking spills.
Why not make your run with us.
It will not only be the speediest, it will be
the smoothest.

WHEN THE LEAST
MEANS THE MOST
...the little-known ‘Law of the Minimum’ is the
key to a big leap forward in Agriculture.
Becalise of its great age, this continent
suffers some seriously limiting defici-
encies which have occurred with the
passage of millions of years. Gradually,
the face of the continent changed and
with it the pattern of climate and soils.
It became the driest continent on the
face of the earth. Soil leached out to
become deficient in vital elements—
singularly deficient is the element phos-
phorus.
Thus, the scene was set—and with it
‘The Problem’ for the man on the land.
Unpredictable rainfall, recurring and
often disastrous droughts, limiting soil
deficiencies, the need for large land
‘holdings’ in order to maintain income,
the inevitably increasing cost of work-
ing the land and consequent diminish-
ing returns.
Foremost and of , critical importance in
the overall problem is the fact of soil
deficiencies, because it is here that im-
mediate and startling results are being
achieved. These very deficiencies have
been the spur to a major breakthrough
in plant nutrition and productivity.
These developments stem from a thought-
provoking fact of plant growth known
as ‘The Law of the Minimum.’
This law says that the ‘maximum ceil-
ing of performance’ of all plants, be they
grain crops, pastures, fruit or vines, is
set by the most deficient soil nutrient
element present, despite the abundance
of all others.
So, in fact, the least dominant factor
becomes the most important!
If the balance of soil nutrients is correc-
ted by supplementing those in short
supply, full advantage is taken of all
FERTILIZERS:
KEY TO FARM
PROSPERITY
nutrient elements and yields are drama-
tically increased. All resources—water,
land, labour and capital investment—
are then used to full advantage and
dormant potential is realised without
any substantial increase in cost.
The process of correcting the balance
of soil nutrients may be best undertaken
by the application of chemical ferti-
lizers containing the nutrient elements
vital to plant growth. The most import-
ant of these are nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium and sulphur, because these
are required in large amounts. Second-
ary and trace elements, notably calcium,
magnesium, molybdenum, zinc, boron,
are also necessary.
Today, Greenleaf is manufacturing fer-
tilizers containing these elements in the
varying proportions required for the
balanced nutrition of our crops and
pastures.

THE LAND
Victoria lays down the law on wheat
UNLESS SOMETHING gives on
wheat stabilisation fairly soon, there’s
going to be no end of trouble financing
this season’s crop—quite apart from the
fact that wheat held on farms, for
which the Wheat Board cannot find
storage, will have to be financed by
the growers themselves (a point which
was made quite clear in a Government
answer to a question on the subject in
the Federal Parliament last week).
Going on present estimates of the
coming harvest, there will be a con-
siderable quantity of wheat for which
no storage will be available in some
States. But the main problem is not
the shortage of storage space. It is
that, unless the Victorian wheat-
growers accept the Government’s stabil-
isation plan, or the latter is suitably
changed to meet their objections (which
fundamentally would require a return
to something like the basis of the
previous stabilisation agreement), the
necessary alterations in State legislation
will not be forthcoming in time in
Victoria (all other States have agreed
to the Federal Government’s proposals)
for the start of financing this season’s
crop.
The Minister of Primary Production,
Mr. J. D. Anthony’s, warnings of
possible financial chaos have fallen
on deaf ears in Victoria, where the
Victorian Farmers’ Union, in which
the State’s wheatgrowers are now united
in a single body, has been launching
almost daily broadsides against the
Government proposals in an attempt to
call the wheat tune for the whole Com-
monwealth. If a new agreement is to
come into operation this year when the
old one expires, it simply cannot happen
that the alternative plan based on “the
one price” principle can be imple-
mented. That would require a complete
reversal of the Government’s position.
Nor does any compromise readily sug-
gest itself, because the VFU and the
Federal Government are poles apart on
fundamental points, as is evident from
the following outline of the VFU’s
alternative proposals, which appear to
have the Victorian Government’s bless-
ing in that it has conveyed them to the
Federal Government.
In the first place, the VFU wants a
single guaranteed price of $1.50 f.o.r.
for the base year (1968-69) for both
home consumption and 200 million
bushels of export wheat. In the case
of home consumption, this would be
the price at ports plus freight to
Tasmania, based on the cost structure
derived from the 1967 economic survey
of the wheat industry. After the base
year it wants both the home-consumption
price and the export price to be adjusted
according to movements in cash and
imputed costs as assessed by the Wheat
Mr. Anthony: a warning of choas
Index Committee. Further, it wants an
additional adjustment in the home-
consumption price to take account of
variations in the cost of shipping wheat
to Tasmania. Again, in setting the single
price in relation to cost of production,
it wants land values to be taken in a
more realistic level in terms of produc-
tive value. As for the stabilisation fund,
it has proposed that growers contribute
an export charge for a maximum of
15 cents a bushel, which would not be
operative unless the average export
price of the season reached the level
of the guaranteed export price.
Although neither the Government nor
the Australian Wheatgrowers’ Federa-
tion can be in any doubt about the
issues involved and the danger in hold-
ing up the new agreement, Victoria’s
truculent wheatgrowers seem somewhat
confused, and the VFU, ever ready to
show its new strength, has been feeding
them a full meal of red herrings as well
as the iron-clad alternative plan. One
of these is that the negotiations between
the Government and the AWF were
not evolved through accepted methods,
in that the wheat committee was not
initially called on to evaluate the Bureau
of Agricultural Economics’ 1967
economic survey of the wheat industry,
which provided a line into the Govern-
ment’s proposals. The growers are also
being told that they have a grievance
that in such a radical change of course
being proposed by the Government
from previous stabilisation schemes they
should have been given more oppor-
tunity of evaluating the proposals when
they were put forward. On that score
the VFU considers, for instance, that
the divided price of 171.5 cents for
home-consumption sales and the esti-
mated net return of 120 cents a bushel
to Victorian growers leaves too much
latitude for illicit trading and opens
the way to the ultimate weakening of
the Australian Wheat Board’s marketing
system.
Great play is also being made of
possible inflationary effects of dividing
the home and guaranteed export prices
for wheat in the Government plan.
One of the arguments being used is
that the inflationary effects within
Australia of increasing the home-
consumption price, without increasing
the guaranteed export price, could not
be fully recouped by growers, who
would be more vulnerable than ever to
cost inflation under the Government’s
proposals. Then there is the broader
argument that, by reducing the home
consumption price and increasing the
export price, the price of bread, eggs,
and so on could be reduced and so
contribute to lowering the cost of living
of the community in general and even
assist export competitiveness. There are
many angles and the VFU has been
projecting most of them, including the
oldest of all chestnuts: “If the Federal
Government is unable or unwilling to
curb rising costs in Australia, it should,
in all justice, offer the same measure of
protection to primary producers that
it does to the rest of the community.”
In short, what the Victorian wheat-
growers want is a retention of the
traditional structure of wheat stabilisa-
tion through the maintenance of the
relationship between cost of production
(generously assessed, though), home-
consumption price, and guaranteed
export price in full awareness that
a reduction in these prices from those
of previous years would be possible
in some circumstances. While this view
is sincerely held and a stand on it is
commendable, it seems high time the
VFU took the gloves off and let the
rest of the wheat industry get on with
its business.

SEA-WATER IRRIGATION

these are that the soils be deep enough
to allow deposited salt to be carried
down below the root zone and that
occasional inundations with fresh water
are possible. Heavy tain storms may be
sufficient. Many soils formed under a
tropical climate are highly resistant to
salting, because they contain virtually
no swelling clays, but an abundance of
iron oxides which absorb the chloride
and neutralise the salting effects. More-
over, these tropical soils usually have
a well-developed porous structure
which facilitates percolation. Queens-
land has vast areas of soils possessing
these characteristics where the wet
season does not last long enough to
produce crops or keep animals growing
throughout the whole year. Of course,
a sea-water irrigation scheme could be
used only to grow salt-tolerant plants,
but fortunately many economic crops
can tolerate high levels of salt in the
ground-water. Among them are most
of our present varieties of pasture
species, pineapples, coconuts, and date
palms. Others could be bred.
Dr. El-Swaify belongs to the Depart-
ment of Agronomy and Soil Science,
College of Tropical Agriculture, Univer-
sity of Hawaii. He pointed out that
standards of water quality and irrigation
practices have always been designed for
the temperate regions, but that tropical
conditions pose an entirely different set
of opportunities, with their own clutch
of special requirements. These need to
be sorted out and thoroughly under-
stood. Nevertheless, a saline irrigation
system, even under ideal circumstances,
would have to be operated with great
care and meticulous attention to the
principles involved. Salting and silting
are ever-present threats to any irrigation
area. Indeed, they can scarcely be
avoided in the long run, and some
authorities regard the hazards so
seriously that they believe irrigation
agriculture should not be practised in
the interests of succeeding generations.
Certainly, history holds ample evi-
dence of the total destructiveness of
irrigation. The valleys of the Tigris and
Euphrates once cradled civilisation and
supported dense populations. By 2000
BC a vast irrigation complex based on
these rivers had been completed and
the area was the granary of the great
Babylonian Empire. Pliny relates that
these farmers used to harvest two grain
crops annually and graze sheep on the
land between times. But less than 20
percent of this land comprising modern
Iraq can now be cropped. The rest of
the landscape is dotted with mounds
representing forgotten but once bustling
towns, and the ancient irrigation works
are filled with silt. The fabulous seaport
of Ur is now 150 ‘miles inland with its
buildings covered by 35 feet of silt.
Similar things happened in Iran,
which was the seat of the great Persian
Empire and where 2400 years ago
Darius I was the “King of Kings.”
The present Shah, assisted by Western
scientists and money, is bravely attempt-
ing to rejuvenate this land, and his
efforts may be regarded as a test of
whether modern knowledge can repair
the ravages of irrigation farming.
Australian agriculturists who have
seen the work have come home shaking
their heads. Closer to our time,
better documented, is the institution of
irrigation agriculture in the Nile Valley.
The system started 2000 years ago and
endured until the beginning of this
century. The Roman Empire drew its
strength, from this irrigation area. The
Nile flooded annually, overflowing its
banks and spreading a rich layer of
loam across the valley. To prevent this
spring flood and permit year-round
controlled irrigation, a dam was built
at Aswan in 1902. This was seen as
the final piece of engineering needed
to complete the great scheme that had
begun in Cleopatra’s time. Since then,
the soils of the valley have been
deteriorating through salinisation, which
has been building up steadily in the
absence of the regular floods, which
n washed them clean every year. Crop
~ yields are lower now than in Roman
times. The new Aswan high dam is
designed to bring another million acres
under irrigation, and it may well prove
to be the ultimate, disaster for Egypt.
Sorry stories like this can be told for
country after country until it might
appear that irrigation has been the
executioner of every civilisation that
has arisen anywhere. Thus, the glories
of. Mali and Ghana, in West Africa,
were legends in medieval Europe. They
flourished on irrigation agriculture, but
declined as salt converted their fertile
fields into wastelands. In the Americas
‘the sumptuous civilisation of the Mayas
passed into oblivion for the same
reason. In China and India much less
ancient irrigation systems stand
abandoned and unproductive, clogged
with silt and poisoned with salt. Since
the British came to Pakistan 200 years
ago, at least seven million acres, mostly
during this century, have been put
totally out of production by irrigation.
In the U.S.A., where there is no short-
age of know-how, money, or power, the
huge irrigation areas in the western
States are thought to be slowly losing
the battle against salt and silt. An esti-
mated 2000 irrigation dams are now
useless impoundments of silt and sand.
Although our irrigation areas have not
yet worn out their second generation
of farmers, we already have our own
unmentionable examples of destruction.
And who will dare to describe the fate
awaiting Adelaide when the Murray
waters become more brackish? Will it
become another Ur, or will thermo-
nuclear desalination save it?
Australians are quick to press the
starter button on the bulldozers when-
ever another plan for an irrigation
scheme is put before them. We might
assert our passion with less serious con-
sequences by adopting El-Swaify’s idea.
Much of the land on which it would be
imposed is more or less useless, any-
way, and a sea-water system is not
subject to siltation. Besides, we already
have a little experience with this form
of irrigation on the ill-starred rice
scheme at the mouth of the Adelaide
River in the Northern Territory.


We’re not old fashioned
We’ve got a modern approach to the people who are helping us develop
New Guinea. We think they deserve the best pay and conditions we can offer. And
we think their ideas are important. New Guinea has its own special
problems and it takes innovation and original thought to overcome them.
But we’re old fashioned in one way. We expect an old-fashioned amount of work
from everyone we employ. We like new-fangled originality to be supported
by old-fashioned keenness and drive. And we think people respond to
this kind of challenge.

BHP is Australia’s own great
industrial enterprise, with
operations in steel, mining, oil
and gas. On all three fronts the
Company is pursuing a vigorous
policy of expansion and
development. More minerals.
More oil and natural gas. And
more and better steels.
This is not unusual at BHP. For
85 years the Company has been
active in developing Australia for
Australians. The pattern will
continue, as BHP forges ahead
to provide Australia’s industrial
leadership into the 21st Century.

INVESTMENT
The Markets
KEEP THE INVESTMENT
EYE RIGHT
ON WMC'S NICKEL
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS # OIL TABLE
AT THE HEIGHT of the mining-
share boom, the great syndrome was to
assess- the total market value of the
various ventures and to say that this
or that stock was clearly undervalued
or overvalued as a result. With the edge
off investor keenness, the total market
valuation line has been forgotten.
Western Mining Corporation was the
acme of the market-valuation analysts;
it was the most spectacular, too. From
a pre-nickel price of $2.50 the shares
just multiplied and multiplied under
the pressure of the worth of its nickel
find. Indeed, it reached $96 (on the old
basis before a 5-for-l split and a new
issue) at one stage giving a total
market value to the WMC enterprise of
$llOO million. Today the market valua-
tion is back to $650 million.
The Kambalda nickel find is no less
rich than it was; the price of nickel
is still $2OOO a ton. WMC is not
buoyant in gold (but the market never
assessed the gold side of the business
at much over $l5 million, anyhow).
The aluminium investment (20 percent
of Alcoa of Australia) is a better pros-
pect than it was; the iron-ore venture
(Koolanooka Hills) is as good as it
was.
The market’s downward reappraisal
of WMC clearly has little to do with
the value of the Kambalda nickel strike.
The annual accounts for 1968, although
adding little to nickel-ore reserves (up
5.5 million tons in the financial year
to 10,133,000 tons), is so clearly a con-
servative statement of the nickel
position that investors could not do
anything but regard it as a bullish
document.
And, as mentioned here before, the
delineation of known reserves is appar-
ently a secondary activity at Kambalda,
at at Paris, and at St. Ives. The
Collins House men prefer to find more
orebodies than to count their worth;
that is a confidence not transmitted to
the share market.
Forgetting all else, the present market
valuation of WMC is the equivalent of
about 400,000 tons of nickel metal
or 10 million tons of ore. Attention can
be drawn to the fact that 10 million
tons of ore has already been proved!
And that proven ore is clearly only a
minor portion of the riches at
Kambalda and environs.
The lack of buying pressure for the
scrip is the key to the market valuation;
a technical situation that should not
draw out many sellers. Holders of the
scrip should rely on the market-
valuation judgment that put them into
the stock at much cheaper prices than
today’s.
BRAMBLES INDUSTRIES
POISED FOR BENEFITS
THE MARKET didn’t care a hoot
about last week’s news fro,m Brambles
Industries Ltd. that profit in the cur-
rent year is running at a rate 36 percent
above last year’s record result. The
good news was revealed just before
lunchtime last Friday to those share-
holders who bothered to attend the
annual meeting in Sydney. But appetites
must have been jaded for Brambles
shares closed unchanged on the week
at $1.70.
The shares have drifted down to this
level from a peak of $1.97 in late
September although the price is
still well ahead of the year’s low point
of $l.OB. The share price has consist-
ently weakened since 1964, in which
year the high-low range was $2.70 t 051.74.
$1.74. In that year a 20 percent divi-
dend was paid on an earning rate of
31.1 percent.
Since then the company’s history has
been marked by rapid expansion of
capital and assets as it has strengthened
its position as one of Australia’s leading
industrial service groups.
Most people, when they think of
Brambles, think of transport; they see
the name whizzing down the nation’s
highways. But the fact is, although
Brambles is a leading national trans-
porter, this activity is only a relatively
minor part of the group’s multiple
interests. Well over half of group
revenue comes from two of Brambles*
five operating divisions industrial
services and materials handling.
The industrial services division is the
biggest -- hiring plant and subcontract-
ing on projects that require earth-
moving extraction and transport of raw
materials. This division is active in all
States, with pools of cranes, front-end
loaders, and other equipment on pro-
jects ranging from the Savage River in
Tasmania to the mining boom centre
of Port Hedland in Western Australia.
The materials handling division hires
and rents integrated “Chep” handling
systems, fork-lift trucks, pallets, and
associated services required by industry
in all States.
An extension of this activity will be
the company’s recently announced move
into container shipping facilities through
a $4 million joint venture with trans-
port rival F. H. Stephens (Consoli-
dated) Ltd. A third partner expected
to join this venture to develop off-
wharf container stations in Sydney and
Melbourne is understood to be the
Patrick Stevedoring group. This will be
announced shortly.
The third largest Brambles division is
steel merchandising - the company is
now Australia’s second or third largest
steel merchant behind the acknowledged
leader, William Adams.
Coming well back in fourth place is .
CHARTISTS WARNING
THE CHARTIST SAYS: C. I. MONIER is an interesting technical situation
which could move against the general trend of the market in the short term. After
a long downtrend since 1961, a base formed above the 26c level, and prices recently
rose to a high for the year at 71c in a confirmed intermediate uptrend at a rate of
appreciation of approximately 100 percent. If prices hold above 60c during the
next week, there is every possibility that a target of close to 90c could be achieved
with the potential of a further move to $1.40 for the longer term. However, any
fall below 40c would be a complete break of trend. Last sale price on 24/10/68
66c.
The Chartist issues a further warning
about the general trend as the technical
indicators point to severe falls in most
indexes, particularly mineral and oil
stocks.

the transport division and to the
surprise of many the manufacturing
division is a poor last, representing
today less than five percent of share-
holders’ funds.
Back in the late 1950 s and early ’6os,
the manufacturing division was a major
part of the Bra'mbles enterprise . . .
and a .major headache to management
plagued by the traditional financial
uncertainties of heavy engineering. It
was during this time 1959 that
the present group general manager and
chief executive, 46-year-old Warwick
J. Holcroft, joined the company and
began to influence its future;
Since then Brambles’ once cumber-
some managerial structure has been
remoulded into completely separate
divisions each with a general
manager reporting directly to Warwick
Holcroft and his head-office aides, who
closely scrutinise profit performance in
the company’s nerve centre at Gold-
fields House, overlooking Sydney
Harbor.
The company is now poised to reap
some benefits from its recent growth
and the immediate future points a
period of consolidation. Takeovers
since balance date in June 30 point to
this. The company has acquired two
transport companies operating within
N.S.W. that can be naturally inte-
grated into present activities. On the
South Coast of N.S.W. it has also
acquired all the coal haulage activities
of another private company thus
increasing its dominance in this region’s
expanding coal haulage business. It has
also shut down another unprofitable
operation in the manufacturing division.
At the shareholders’ meeting last
Friday, the chairman (Mr. R. A. Dick-
son) said net profit for the first three
months to September 30 was more than
$200,000 ahead of the previous first
half . . . and directors were “optimistic”
about prospects for the year. If their
optimism indicates a continuation of
this trend, profits in the full year should
be up by as much as 36 percent
and a return to higher dividends should
be possible.
MINING ISSUE
TEST OF ENDURANCE
WHEN PLANNING their three-for-
one new par issue, directors of Endur-
ance Tin could hardly have envisaged
such a marked change in the mining-
share weather as in the past few weeks.
But at least there’s still some bonus
element left in it. On present indica-
tions the rights should come on at
around their theoretical price (based
on last week’s steadier performance,
around $1.25 for the old shares which is
equivalent to $2.50 before the shares
were split into 25-centers recently). In
their pre-split form they got up to $5
earlier this year on nickel hopes arising
from the three-year-option taken by the
company on the MT Weld nickel and
osmiridium prospect in Western Tas-
mania. These hopes are still alive, but
the main object of the present new capi-
tal-raising operation, expected to bring
in $282,000, is the revitalisation of the
company’s tin operation, which is, of
course, in the north-east of the Island
State (subscriptions, which are tax free,
are 10 cents on application and 15
cents on March 29 next year).
The tin operation is being given a
new look, and as a result of new equip-
ment and plant being installed, and
general streamlining of operations, the
company expects to get back to , the
dividend list pretty rapidly. Proven
reserves of 1140 tons of casserite (tin)
of an average grade of 0.71 b. a cubic
yard are estimated to gross (at $2OOO
a ton) $2,280,000 and net $1,140,000
over the next six years of operation.
(The tin is at present being sold to
Lemprieres, but three Japanese com-
panies have recently been showing
interest both in the mine and its
product.) The company, apparently,
is looking at another nearby tin prospect
in Tasmania, reputed to have even
bigger reserves than its own, but it
would seem to have enough on its hands
in getting results from the old field
(which has already yielded about 3000
tons of tin since operations started in
1922).
Mining
THERE'S MORE THAN JUST
DIGGING TO
THE IRON-ORE INDUSTRY
MR. R. T. MADIGAN, the man-
aging director of Hamersley Iron,,
deserves high praise for two recent
articles in which he has gone a long
way toward putting Australia’s
glamorous iron-ore industry into some
sort of international and technological
perspective. Totting up those appar-
ently astronomical contracts already
achieved w'ith the Japanese makes it
very easy to exalt the magnitude of
the Western Australian, and Tasmanian,
accomplishment. But the rest of the
world has not been standing still, either.
Not only are other countries’ reserves
expanding into a possible high state of
oversupply; the techniques of the steel
industry are also changing. In
emphasising this latter point, and in
explaining how Hamersley is attempting
to keep up with the technical times,
Mr. Madigan has stressed that, fan-
tastic reserves and all, iron-ore miners
in Australia cannot afford to relax.
Something of the new pressure is
almost certainly illustrated by the hard
bargaining distinguishing Cliffs Western
Australian Mining’s current negotiations
in Japan. Cliffs’ situation, too, links
up with what Mr. Madigan has to say

about the economics of the pelletising
process (as examined below). Anyhow,
two or three years of close discussion
have led the Robe River group only to
the verge of signing the actual con-
tract. Conscious of technological
developments, as well as the supply
position, the Japanese mills have laid
down especially exacting specifications
for the pellets—and these may be hard
to guarantee by the Robe River opera-
tors. Indeed, Cliffs’ president has had
to come back to Australia to discover
whether the stringent specifications can
be fulfilled. The contract hangs fire,
and a massive penalty fine with it.
There are other fish in the sea, as
the Japanese well know. For Aus-
tralia’s own protection, therefore, our
iron-ore industry must always be con-
scious of this and also of the existence
of other world markets. Mr. Madigan’s
first article in the initial number of
“Nat/Dev,” the Department of National
Development’s new quarterly, mentions
that in 1970 the total world production
of iron-ore should be about 700 million
tons, of which 30 million tons, a mere
4j percent, will come from Australia.
Significant as Australia’s contribution
to Japan will be, its world role is still
minor.
Mr. Madigan’s own company is
thoroughly aware of the need to chase
other markets. More importantly, it has
become highly aware of con-
temporary processes among the steel-
makers. Here too, in steelmaking, over-
capacity rules, so again the steelmaker
must be given what he wants. Electric
steelmaking is expected to make great
strides in the near future; this has led
Hamersley in particular to move bril-
liantly toward producing metallised
agglomerates, the processing of which
figured largely in Hamersley’s acqusition
of the Paraburdoo (W.A.) leases. Metal-
lised materials have a growing applica-
tion as a supplement for scrap as the
basic feed in electric steelmaking and
additionally may be used as a coolant
in basic-oxygen converters. Of course
metallising doesn’t only call for the
technical ability highly to upgrade the
iron ore; it demands the confidence and
skill to win sizable new markets.
These points Mr. Madigan dilates
upon in his second, Sydney newspaper
article. Supply, with the tremendous
reserves of the Pilbara, is no longer a
problem: “the whole focus of attention
turns to the question of markets,” and
the smelters are continually asking for
ore of higher and higher iron content.
Moreover, steelmakers often like to take
their materials from a number of sources
and frequently limit the amount of a
particular material derived from any one
supplier; thus a seller should be ready
to offer a variety of products.
Mr. Madigan, in surveying the his-
torical usage of pellets, suggests that,
though their merits in the blast furnace
must be realised, “certain aspects of
their production still remain more of an
art than a science.” Significantly, from
Australia’s viewpoint, there is a measure

Addressed “FINANCIAL EXECUTIVE”
of disillusionment with pellets among
the Japanese steelmakers. But their usage
remains in an expansive stage. Never-
theless, and this might be another rub
for Cliffs, Mr. Madigan asserts that “the
production of pellets for export is not
really justified by existing price levels.
Producei's are under constant pressure
to reduce prices further so that pellets
can be more competitive with fluxed
sinter.” He believes the whole capital-
intensive operation could be put to better
use.
Hence the decision on metallised
agglomerates—which “could prove to be
of greater importance to the develop-
ment of this country than the develop-
ment of a second steel industry.”
Mr. Madigan’s two articles should be
closely read by everybody concerned and
interested in Australia’s exploitation of
the iron-ore deposits. Perhaps it is worth
concluding by indicating that he be-
lieves the ores of the Pilbara can be
competitive in the European market
with South American, West African,
Canadian, and Swedish suppliers.

ROCLA IS BRINGING
ITS KNOW-HOW
TO THE BRITISH ISLES
IN A REVERSE of the usual situation,
the U.K. is providing the scope for
growth for an Australian company,
Rocla Industries Ltd., which last year
commenced operations in a factory at
St. Helens, in Lancashire. A second
factory will open up in Buckingham-
shire which will be in production at
the beginning qf the next financial year
(mid-1969) to supercharge profits for
1969-70. Rocla expects to invest some-
thing like $2.5 million in the U.K.
over five years, to achieve a steady
expansion of profits to the point where,
at the end of the ’sixties, the U.K. sub-
sidiary may represent a substantial
proportion of overall earnings.
The compactness of the U.K. market,
which is served at present by about
three large concrete-pipe markets,
attracted Rocla. In Australia, a series
of plants are required to obtain the
same volume of business which in the
U.K. can be covered by a couple of
plants. The British price structure is
quite sound, and the markups much
the same as aB over the world, but it
would appear that the return on capital
invested must be more favorable than
in Australia. A capital grant of about
$450,000 from the U.K. Government
for establishing the plant (St. Helens)
in a “developing area” also made the
first move in the British expansion
more enticing.
Until recently the British manufac-

turers used to produce their concrete
pipes using tubes as liners, and casting
concrete over them, a more costly
procedure than Rocla’s time-honored
method of monolithic construction, put-
ting the steel reinforcement into the
body of the pipe. Adoption of new
British standard specifications have
encouraged a switch to Rocla-type pipes
for public works in Britain.
Australia uses a large volume of
pipes, and Australian pipe-makers have
a reputation for advanced techniques.
Steel pipes here are cheaper than in
many other countries, so Australian
concrete - pipe makers have been
pressurised over the years into develop-
ing very economic processes to survive.
Steel pipes compete with Rocla’s
concrete pipes only in the field of
water supply for home and industry.
They do not compete with concrete
in disposal of sewerage and drainage.
Rocla’s prestressed and reinforced
concrete pipes are made up to 120
inches in diameter, while the company
makes allied concrete products, such
as box and arch culverts, bridge beams,
channelling units, multiway ducts,
paving flags, and troughs.
Invention and development by Rocla
of the roller suspension pipe-making
machine and the automatic reinforce-
ment welding machines in the late
’forties laid the foundation for Rocla
prosperity. Patents for these machines
are registered in many countries, and,
since 19.48, manufacturing licences were
granted to leading manufacturers over-
seas. Rocla concrete pipes are now
made under licence in 22 countries,
Rocla receiving continuing royalties or
a lump sum for its patents and know-
how. The plant manufacturing depart-
ment in Melbourne supplies specialised
Rocla pipe-making equipment overseas.
The trend in the industry is to sub-
stitution of precast concrete products
for concrete works carried out on the
site. Rocla has 16 factories in Australia
making concrete pipes and products,
and in 1968 sales rose 8 percent in
this division. A new factory began pro-
duction at Cloverdale, in Perth, in May,
1967, and a Wollongong, N.S.W., in
1968.
The most difficult types of concrete
work tend to be the most profitable.
Rocla has a special contracts division
executing major contracts involving
large quantities of specially designed
prestressed concrete pipe. This made
an excellent contribution to 1968 results,
as the contracts-in-progress figure for
1967 suggested: the balance sheet
showed a peak $325,000 in 1967
compared with $182,000 in 1966 and
$221,000 in the latest year, indicating
some fall off for this current year. Last
year a $1.7 million contract for the
Electricity Commission of N.S.W. was
completed. Current contracts this year
include an $BOO,OOO job for the
Toowoomba City Council, and in
Britain a $750,000 waterworks contract
for Leeds.
A large part of the group turnover
derives from sales to or for public
works projects, water supply, sewerage,
and drainage for government and semi-
government authorities. In June, 1968,
the Loan Council Meeting approved
loan fund allocations for State works
and housing programs of $7lO million,
up 5 percent on 1967-68, and for semi-
government of $357 million, a 14.7
percent increase. So, despite the
Premiers’ complaint, funds available this
year will be greater than last. The'
urgent need in the community for better
roads, improved water supply, and
irrigation, and adequate drainage and
sewerage create a firm demand for the
sort of goods and services which Rocla
supplies, but satisfaction of these needs
depends very much on government
finances.
Stoneware pipes are almost as big
a market as concrete pipes, though the
impression is gained that Rocla is not
so dominant here. Rocla makes 6in.,
9in., and 12in.-diameter clay pipes for
house connections, in its Campbellfield,
Vic., factory, where there are exten-
sive clay deposits, and at East Croydon
in South Australia. A new plant at
Wacol, in Brisbane, is being erected,
but the company has no firm plans as
yet to set up in Sydney with a stone-
ware plant. It does have 120 acres of
claybearing land at Dinmore, in Bris-
bane. Following U.S. trends, the
elimination of glazing will save the
company some money directly in pro-
duction. The salt used in the glazing
attacks the bricks in the kiln, and it
has been belatedly discovered that
glazing adds nothing to the quality
of the pipes. The stoneware division
had a better sales lift even than the
concrete division in 1968, with the
Adelaide stoneware plant surprisingly
buoyant, and the Victorian profits fall-
ing away with a reduction in govern-
ment business toward the end of the
year.
All group factories worked at a
“reasonably good level of capacity” in
1968. After writing off all establish-
ment expenses and running-in costs
(for a net U.K. loss of $87,000) Rocla
was still able to show a 28 percent
improvement in overall pretax profit.
After providing for tax at 50 percent
of declared pretax profit (tax pro-
vision 43 percent higher) the gain in
net profit was 15 percent from a 12
percent sales growth. So operations in
Australia were very healthy in 1967-68.
The company aims to reverse the
downward trend of return on total
funds employed by expanding turn-
over, by research and development,
and by cost reduction. Its object is
always to keep selling prices stable
by productivity gains and by cost
control to offset rises in material costs
and wage rates. It succeeded in hold-
ing prices steady from 1956 to March,
1965, when prices of concrete products
went up five percent, and stoneware
pipes were also raised. Steep wage

increases in the last couple of years,
including the $1.35 total wage increase
early in October, may hasten the day
for new price increases, though no
doubt competitors in concrete and
eathernware, and ouside Rocla’s
domain in steel, will be similarly
affected.
Rocla has a 35 percent interest in a
South African associate, but it has never
paid a dividend. There are no restric-
tions on remission of capital from South
Africa, and the South African economy
is so buoyant that the locals are tending
to buy out their overseas partners,
though there is no sugestion yet that
Rocla Australian will be bought out.
No revenue figures are disclosed (nor
for that matter the licence income)
but otherwise the company’s accounts
and activities are very well presented.
Despite the $1.5 million capital
expenditure in 1968 (and $4.2 million
in the last four years) the tax saving
therefrom was not substantial, a mere
$36,000 in the last year. Judging by
the $2,147,000 capital expenditure not
provided for in the accounts ($317,000
in 1967) the capital expenditure pro-
gram is accelerating. Current pro-
grammed capital expenditure is on the
Wacol stoneware plant and the second
British plant. Cash flow has built up
about 50 percent since 1964, aided by
heavy depreciation, which is always
substantially higher than allowed for

The decline in working capital ratio
from the usual 2.1 to 1.8 to one sug-
gests there is more likelihood of a
cash issue, inevitably on favorable
terms, than at any time in years,
although the company described its

matter is dependent more on financial
arrangements for the U.K. establish-
ment, than on local capital needs.
The Australian operations enjoyed
plenty of liquidity in 1968 as there
were $300,000 invested in the short-

by a long-term (ten years) loan from
Barclays, which, at 1968 balance date,
was drawn to the extent of $643,000.

A GROWTH PACKAGE,
AND INCOME, FROM
REALTY DEVELOPMENT
FOUR WEEKS ago in this column I
was extolling investment in property
companies, an industry which I believe
is seriously undervalued on the share
market. On that occasion I listed five
leading Australian developers and made
an examination of Stocks and Holdings’
operations. This week I want to return
to the “bricks and mortar” theme.
Following the earlier comparison of
price/earnings ratios for property com-
panies in London and Australia, I had
little difficulty in selecting this week’s
stock. The prize for having the lowest
price/earnings ratio of the five Austra-
lian leaders goes to Realty Development
and Mortgage (R.D. & M.). On 1967
profit figures, Realty Development has
a price/earnings ratio of 13.0 (taking
account of the two share issues in 1967-
68), and is likely to have an even lower
figure when the company reports an
expected profit increase for the year
ending September 30, 1968.
Australian property companies have
traditionally used one of two methods
for handling their long-term interests in
investment developments. They either
sell and lease back the project, or go
into a joint venture where the partner
(usually an institution) provides mort-
gage money and also takes an equity
interest. R.D. & M. is the only company
owning investment properties wholly in
its own right and using institutional
funds solely for first-mortgage financing.
Obviously, this is the most conservative
way of running a development company,
but it does have some advantages. The
sale and lease-back method gives strong
income growth but does little for capital
gains, while under a dividend-ownership
scheme the developer, and consequently
the shareholder, is sharing both his
capital and income growth with an
institution. R.D. & M. is getting the
best of both worlds from investment
properties, as all capital and income
growth comes to the one organisation.

The necessary institutional connection is
provided by shareholdings in R.D. &
M. itself, and the lack of joint ventures
places institutional and ordinary share-
holders on the same footing. The group’s
income growth is given an additional
boost by the company’s trading opera-
tions, where it is the second-largest
project builder of homes and units in
Australia, after A. V. Jennings. Erection
of well over 1000 homes and units for
sale is the current annual target, I
believe, and these activities make a
substantial contribution to group profits,
which are calculated only on cash
received in a given year.
A further example of R. D. & M.’s
success in harnessing financial strength
through adopting a conservative
approach to its operations is shown by
the company’s mortgage ratio. This is
a widely used ratio in England for
assessing asset gearing in a property
company. The ratio is obtained by
dividing mortgages, secured loans,
debentures, and bank indebtedness by
the value of the properties as shown
in the balance sheet, and expressing the
resulting figure as a percentage. An
examination of 41 English property
companies shows the median mortgage
ratio at 56.3. Bearing in mind that a
low ratio is an indication of a com-
pany’s internal financial resources,
Realty Development’s figure of 62 com-
pares very favorably with the English
ratios. The lowest ratio in Australia is
Stocks and Holdings with 54.2 (below
the English median), and following
Realty Development we have Lend
Lease, Westfield, and Hooker in last
place. As the English companies are
operating with a combination of the
best professional and technical skills
available, it is clear that Realty
Development, which was modelled on
the English pattern of operation, also
has tremendous capital strength.
The group was formed in 1958 under
the auspices of the investment bankers
Development Finance Corporation and
has attracted wide institutional support.
Since incorporation, operations have
been extended to cover all mainland
States in both investment and trading.
Investment projects are based on pro-
vision of facilities for the retail trade
and commerce through shopping com-
munity and regional centres, and inner-
city developments. In New South Wales
the group owns shopping centres at
Seven Hills, St. Ives, Hornsby, Went-
worthville, and Gosford, the last three
projects being part of existing centres.
Strategic siting in areas of increasing
population density has provided very
satisfactory profit results.
The St. Ives centre comprises a total
retail area of 60,000 square feet for
supermarket and variety stores, and
parking facilities for 540 cars. Seven
Hills has a letting area of 87,000 square
feet and can take 1000 cars, while Gos-
ford and Wentworthville account for
27,500 square feet. The principal

has further housing interests at North-
mead and Thornleigh.
Among interesting developments
being launched by R. D. & M. is the
marketing of transportable houses in
Western Australia. The group has ten
attractive models available and, pro-
vided you have a heavy truck, it’s a
case of “have house, will travel” in the
West. The big advantage in transport-
able houses, apart from their mass pro-
duction, is time saved in erection. The
whole house is put together in one
plant, loaded on a trailer, and moved
to the location, where services are con-
nected and the finishing touches made.
When the location is at a distance the
problem of keeping men on the site
for lengthy periods is overcome.

By film to
Coopers Creek
with Aunt Edna
By RICHARD CAMPBELL
Lionel Harris ... only
Terrence Rattigan knows
what happened on the
journey
TO THE endless reel of titles proposed
as films to be made in Australia, add
“Burke and Wills.” After so many
“Ned Kellys” projected but not yet
begun, it is somewhat daunting to think
of one of the Great Australian Epics
having to undergo similarly tortuous
preparations to put it on the screen,
but Lionel Harris is talking about the
project with resolute determination.
Mr. Harris is a well-regarded
English film, television, and theatre
director who might be remembered in
Australia for his productions here of
“The Sleeping Prince,” “Separate
Tables,” “The Chalk Garden,” and
“The Little Hut” in the 19505. He was
last in Australia in 1966 to produce
Alan Poolman’s play “Kain” as a joint
ABC-BBC program for television. Last
week he arrived quietly in Melbourne
to begin planning his $1 million pro-
duction of “Burke and Wills.”
He is the principal of a new pro-
duction company, Veric Independent
Ltd., and seems to be free of one of
the most besetting problems in film
production -- lack of money. “After
the National Film Finance Corporation
in London and various production
companies saw ‘Kain,’ they pelted me
with scripts of all kinds. I turned
them all down for various reasons
until, finally, the NFFC asked me what
I wanted to do. I replied that what
I wanted to do was to make good
films in Australia, and they said, ‘Form
a company for the purpose and we
shall find the backing.’ ”
His decision to kick-off with “Burke
and Wills” was not made randomly.
“The idea began here, in this very
room, in 1955,” he said last week from
a comfortable chair in John Carroll’s
commodious office in Melbourne’s
Princess Theatre. “Garnet Carroll urged
the idea on Terrence Rattigan and me
when we were out here for the produc-
tion of two Rattigan plays.
“Garnet had seen the possibilities of
several Australian stories and was
always very keen to make them into
films. He was a remarkable man, Mr.
Carroll. I would say he was the most
stimulating man in Australian theatre
he would have been regarded as that
anywhere.”
The “Burke and Wills” screenplay is
to be written by Rattigan. Harris says
it is already half completed. It seems
an unlikely venture for a playwright
who once tailored his plays to suit
the taste of a prim, fictional Aunt
Edna, but the man is a craftsman and
Harris says he has turned down several
Hollywood offers in favor of the Aus-
tralian scenai’io.
Harris will be both director and
producer of the film, which, in Harris’
words, will be “wide-screen, full-length,
Cinema Scope, and so on.” British Lion
will distribute it. Harris says he and
Rattigan will be back in Australia
early next year to do a cross-
country trek on the Burke and Wills
trail. (“Land Rovers? That’s a good
idea. Someone suggested an air-
conditioned car.”) Production is
scheduled to begin in the second half
of 1969.
“Yes, this idea has fascinated me
since the idea was first put forward
by Mr. Carroll. I have thought several
times of doing it for television, but
I couldn’t; television just isn’t the
right medium for portraying the Centre
in all its awesome magnificence. The
interior of Australia is an experience,
not just a view. It takes cinema to
provide that experience. I don’t think
that’s the job of TV.
“There are many problems and
riddles to be solved about facts and
events and so forth, but we are well
on the way to solving them,” said Mr.
Harris, smiling inscrutably. “We have
done research in London well,
everywhere for a year. We have
uncovered some most interesting
information.”
Would Burke’s character present
any special difficulties? “I don’t see
why we should have trouble with
Burke’s character. He managed, so I’m
sure we can, too. But really he was
a quite extraordinary person; a most
restless individual even by today’s
standards. Of course, Burke and Wills
are by no means the only characters
in the story. There is the story about
King, for example. He' was
the weakest, the most vul-
nerable, the youngest of
the party. Nobody thought
he would survive the trek,
let alone what happened
after.”
Mr. Harris did not think
there would be great diffi-
culty in avoiding the well-
worn theme of a group of
men caught by circum-
stances, with minds and
nerves frayed. “They are in
no one situation —they are
everywhere and nowhere all
at once,” he said, enigmati-
cally.
Nobody knew what hap-
pened to them on the jour-
ney except Rattigan.
King’s account was not very helpful,
“Rattigan knows precisely what hap-
pened on the journey why and how
it happened,” said Harris with a sly
gleam.
No, it wouldn’t be just a great
panorama of desert. “Cinemagoers
won’t come out blowing red dust off
their clothes. But your desert is
certainly new to cinemagoers in other
countries; it is unique and extremely'
exhilarating.”
Harris was not prepared to give too
much away about the cast. Yes, there
would be international names, but he
wasn’t naming them. Burton’s name
had been mentioned but only
mentioned. The cast probably would be
announced next March.
Mr. Harris said his wasn’t just a
one-film operation. He would like to
make more films in Australia per-
haps three but he would not even
hint at the possible subjects. “If you
think I would tell, you must be mad
. . . somebody is probably already
trying to steal this one. No, let’s make
this one first-rate, then we will go on
from that point.”
Why had he left it so long before
making a full-length feature film?
“Why do a film unless you have found
something you’re pretty kinky for?”
A CAUTIOUS VOICE
AMONG THE HASTE
By DENIS O'BRIEN
IN A year in which more people have
talked about making films in Australia
than ever before, five feature-length
productions have been made here, and
11 more are scheduled for production
next year (see list next page). The
Lionel Harris “Burke and Wills” pro-
ject is the latest to be added to the
1969 list, which includes several that
were scheduled for production this year
or earlier, but which now seem to have
a reasonable chance of completion next


year. Not included, though, are such
long-standing projects as “Ned Kelly”
(for which there have been at least 16
different plans) and “Call Me When
the Cross Turns Over” (for which a
production is still being discussed eight
years after it was first proposed).
Although discussion about filming in
Australia is still heavily punctuated
with cynicism, there is now a significant
tempo of activity and an improving
climate of attitude. But what is con-
cerning such earnest lobbyists as the
Producers and Directors’ Guild of Aus-
tralia is the fear that the activity will
be mistaken for the healthy rebirth
of an indigenous Australian film
industry, when all that is happening
is an animation of co-production deals,
controlled by foreign interests.
Having recently prodded the N.S.W.
Government into enforcing the Aus-
tralian quota provisions of the Cine-
matograph Films Act, the PDGA
has emerged as the voice of conscience
for a national film industry and
has begun speaking up loudly about the
practical problems which have to be
solved before Australian film-makers
can begin operating with the same con-
fidence that their contemporaries in
other countries enjoy.
The Guild is concerned that the
many co-production films now arising
in Australia will overwhelm the efforts
of indigenous film-makers by being
included as Australian quota films and
thus, according to PDGA president
Roland Beckett, defeating the spirit of
the quota provisions.
Beckett says the Guild is viewing
the spate of co-production deals with
guarded enthusiasm. “We are naturally
happy that people want to make films
here and that some Australian talents
will be employed. But we don’t want
what small advances we are making
confused by the mere presence of a
lot of motion-picture cameras at work.
A truly Australian film industry—and
that is what we have to have—is not
one that exists by courtesy of visits by
foreign interests.”
The Guild is now preparing to
additionally protect an Australian
industry by arguing for an arrangement
which gave birth to Spain’s now-
flourishing industry when Hollywood
began extensively using that country
for productions in the 19505: the
Spanish Government insisted that for
every three American productions made
in Spain enough money had to be paid
into the local film industry to make one
fully Spanish production. Hollywood
has now virtually retreated from Spain,
but the country is left with enough
resources in film to embark on co-
productions with countries such as
France and Italy- on equal terms.
But most of all the PDGA is cam-
paigning for an overhaul of the N.S.W.
Theatres and Films Commission to
make it a properly effective instrument
of the Cinematograph Films Act. “A
basic need of any film producer is box-
office information and details of dis-
tribution costs,” says Beckett. “The
producer needs this as essential market-
ing information and to protect him from
exploitation.
“Such information is commonly
available to the industry overseas, and
a method for obtaining it is embodied
in our Films Act. However, our recent
request for the use of this provision was
turned down by the Theatres and Films
Commission without a satisfactory
reason. While this situation exists, the
Commission will be strongly suspect.”
FILMS/BEVERUEY TIVEY
BACKWARD STEPS
Here We Go Round The Mulberry
Bush. Director, Clive Donner.
Billion Dollar Brain. Director, Ken
Russell.
SINCE HIS entertaining “Nothing
But The Best,” Clive Donner seems
to me to have gone steadily down, with
the noisy, tasteless, totally dislikable
“What’s New, Pussycat?” and “Luv.”
His new movie is somewhat more
attractive and has some funny moments
and good performances. But it does
base itself on the assumption that
if you’re a day over 20 you’re
practically dead, which isn’t particularly
appealing to those in the higher age
groups who still, like the officer in
“South Pacific,” don’t consider them-
selves through.
This isn’t a matter of theme but of
attitude. After all, both “The
Barry Evans and Judy Geeson in
“Here We Go Round the Mulberry
Bush"
Graduate” and “You’re A Big Boy
Now” dealt with a similar subject
the first alarming steps into adulthood
of a young man but they had a
broader vision. In them the want of
understanding came from both sides:
both the older and the younger
generations failed in their duty toward
each other. In Donner’s film, the
youngsters have it all their own way
anyone over two decades is mori-
bund, stupid, or kinky.
Still, the movie really isn’t impressive
enough to get genuinely annoyed about.
It’s brightly photographed in some
rather garish color, and Barry Evans,
as the boy involved in growing up, is
a promising player and an engaging
personality (though surely a little too
knowing for the awakening innocent?).
Donner’s direction shows the sort of
feverish search for novelty that has
unfortunately grown on him and
which often isn’t in the least novel
but merely derivative and silly. For
instance, the boy’s sexual fantasies are
shown in silent-movie style: would a
contemporary schoolboy of 17 dream
that way? All the same, when Donner
stops trying so hard, he can be enter-
taining enough, aided by his able but
sometimes over-enthusiastic cast.
I watched the first half-hour of
“Billion Dollar Brain” with growing
alarm, increasingly convinced that I
had at last taken leave of my senses.
After that I pulled myself together and
realised that nobody could understand
it, and that Michael Caine often looked
just as bewildered as I felt. So I
stopped even attempting to follow the
plot and contented myself with look-
ing at the bleakly handsome snow-
AUSTRALIA'S MOVIE SCOREBOARD
THE current Commonwealth United
Goldsworthy production of “Color
Me Dead” is the fifth full-length
feature film to be made in Australia
this year. The others: “Age of Con-
sent” (Michael Powell), “It Takes
All Kinds” (Goldsworthy), “2000
Weeks” (Senior-Eltham), and “The
Drifting Avenger” (Toei Motion
Pictures, Japan).
Latest information lists 11 titles
scheduled to be filmed as co-produc-
tion deals in the next 12 months.
They are: “After Sundown,” “Long
Shadow,” and “Return of the Boom-
erang” (all involving Ajax Films,
Sydney); “Squeeze a Flower,
Squeeze a Grape” and “Wake In
Fright” (Ajax-NLT); an untitled
production involving Toei of Japan
and Artransa Studios; “Witness to a
Killing” and “My Friend Li Hui
Chen” (Commonwealth United-
Goldsworthy); “Last Bus to Banjo
Creek” (Rod Taylor-Goldsworthy);
“The Scavengers” (a Perth Syndi-
cate with v Canadian and British
interests); “Burke and Wills”
(Lionel Harris).


scapes most of the film was shot in
Finland, which is a marvellous place to
look at, particularly from a theatre
situated in a temperate zone.
Toward the end of the movie, Ed
Begley enlivens the proceedings con-
siderably with a wild, whirling perfor-
mance as the maniac tycoon, whose
pathological fear of Communism is the
cause of all the trouble; but Michael
Caine, though he looks most attractive
in a black fur hat, simply coasts through
his role with his handsome features
often registering a sneer of simple bore-
dom. What happened to the gutsy,
insolent Harry Palmer of “The Ipcress
File”? And what happened to the wit
and style of that original Palmer movie?
Director Ken Russell (when he’s not,
for obscure reasons of his own, photo-
graphing things upside down) has given
us nothing but a lot of pretty pictures
and some meaningless mystification.
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
THE FADING DAYS
OF THE VIRTUOSO
THERE IS a sad and rather faded
atmosphere about a virtuoso violinist’s
recital these days. It doesn’t seem very
long ago when the young Menuhin who
with a Handel sonata to open, a
concerto, mercifully not the Beethoven
or the Brahms, to follow, and then a
riot of Wieniawski, Sarasate, and
Pagannini could bring down the house.
Now any overt fireworks have to be
left out of the program and only
displayed in the extras.
That you hear them at all is depen-
dent on the audience reaction, which
is often so tempered by the serious
music-making which has gone before
that the applause is sometimes too
meagre to give the performer an excuse
for trotting out his showpieces. One
can hardly deplore the desire of a
fiddler to play pieces which he has
spent the greater part of his life slaving
away at, and I, for one, regret the
passing of the excitement they engen-
dered, piffling though much of the
music was.
Henryk Szeryng’s two Sydney recitals
in the Town Hall were copybook
examples of what we have been taught
to expect; six sonatas, the Vitali “Cha-
conne,” and Ravel’s “Tzigane,” that
diabolically clever evocation of the
gipsy fiddler which elevates satire to
high art. These works, with the excep-
tion of the unaccompanied Bach, the
“Tzigane,” and the “Chaconne,” share
equal honors with piano; in fact, two of
them, the “Kreutzer” Sonata of Beet-
hoven and the Mozart B Flat, are
weighted on the side of the pianist, but
the accurate and over-inhibited Janetta
McStay was billed as “accompanist.”
Also the piano tone would have
benefited if the lid had been on the
short stick, for Mr. Szeryng is a player
of immense stature and would be
unlikely to be eclipsed even by Richter
with the lid right up. He undoubtedly
would have successfully contended with
all Miss McStay could dish out. This
relegating of an assisting artist to an
accompanist created an imbalance
which, it must be admitted, was more
social than artistic, for the ensemble
was well nigh perfect, lacking only in
assertion from the piano, which could
have been due to the natural reticence
of a talented young person thrown into
the company of a big gun like Szeryng,
as well as the contributing factor of
the closed lid.
Most mothers who forced their off-
spring to learn the violin in the period
between World Wars I and II did so
in the hope that they would make a
sound like Kreisler, and one can
Henryk Szeryng ... among the great
violinists of the world.
imagine, if the same sort of ambition
inspired the mothers of today, they
would substitute Szeryng for Kreisler,
for a more beautiful sound would be
difficult to imagine. Warm and round,
with an overlay of ravishing sweetness,
Szeryng’s tone is one of the wonders
of the age. This, coupled with the
fiery technique and immaculate intona-
tion, puts him amongst the great
violinists of the world, and there was
enough of the sheer love of fiddle play-
ing in him to make the string of con-
fections which made up his encores a
thorough joy. However, throughout the
recitals one was conscious of what
appears to be an inescapable truth:
the days of the touring solo violin
virtuoso are numbered, and henceforth
he is only likely to exist as part of a
sonata team.
The fourth International Society for
Contemporary Music concert for 1968,
at the Cell Block Theatre, was interest-
packed with, and this is rare indeed,
music for all but the most reactionary.
“Three Poems of Robert Burns” set
by Eric Gross were most effective and
splendidly performed by Marilyn
Richardson, who sang from memory—
a graceful tribute to the composer by
one of the busiest sopranos in Australia.
There was little point in transcribing
the accompaniment for the available
instruments, for the songs had obviously
been composed without having these
instrumental colors in mind.
The most immediately intriguing
sounds of the night came from “Music
for Albion Moonlight” by David
Bedford. Here again an extraordinarily
convincing performance from Marilyn
Richardson and some evocative, chilling,
and thrilling noises from the players,
although, after a while, there was a
tendency to be repetitive and predic-
table. A competent performance of
Charles Ives’ Sonata No. 1 for Violin
and Piano was given by Betty Jaggard
and Rachel Valler. Richard Meale
played “Je Dros, Mais Mon Coeur
Veille” of Messiaen with dedication
and sensibility, as well as conducting
the larger ensembles, and Alison Bauld’s
“Withdrawal,”- the larger part of which
appeared to be by courtesy of Ronald
Strahan, received its first performance.
RECORDS/JOHN CARGHER
HUGO'S GLORY
Ernana. Verdi. RCA Italian Orchestra.
RCA LSC.BOO6.
THE LOVERS are blissfully celebra-
ting their marriage. A horn blows in
the distance. “Sorry, dear,” says
Ernani, “but I promised to commit
suicide as soon as your ex-fiance blows
that horn.” He then stabs himself. End
of opera.
The plot of “La Gioconda” is only
slightly less silly than that of “Ernani,”
yet both are based on works by Victor
Hugo, who is still rated as one of the
great names in literature. It is not that
Hugo was inept or stupid, but that our
moral values have changed over the
years. We may laugh at Hugo’s ideas
of honor; in terms of international
politics, big business, or advertising-
ethics we should be laughing on the
other side of our faces.
It was Bernard Shaw who said that
Hugo’s greatest glory was supplying the
stories for Verdi operas, a debatable
point of view at the time it was said,
but one which certainly applies today.
“Ernani” was one of Verdi’s early suc-
cesses and it has all the ingredients
one expects from the young Verdi
plenty of blood and thunder mixed
with rousing good tunes. This raw
amalgam does not rise to the heights
of “Rigoletto” (another Hugo story),
which came seven years later and
started Verdi’s great middle period.
But the tunes are ample and incessant,
though they do not rise to any great
heights, and the opera is dramatically
very well constructed. The characters
and their motivations are finely drawn
and believable, whatever our opinion of
their code of honor.
The new RCA recording is unlikely
to be bettered. Carlo Bergonzi gives
one of his best performances as Ernani,
Leontyne Price is admirable, Ezio
Flagello a fine villain, and Mario Sereni
quite adequate, if a little colorless, as
the third character in love with poor
Elvira, who may have loved and lost
but certainly was not never loved at
all.

AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL
FOR THE ARTS
The Council, established as the Common-
wealth Government's adviser on the Perform-
ing Arts and as its financial agent in these
matters, has made one of its first priorities
the formation of a Drama Committee. The
suggested Terms of Reference for the Com-
mittee are, in part:
To examine the present state of the pro-
fessional drama theatre in Australia and to
suggest ways and means by which the
Council, within the limit of its budgetary
capacity, may be able to assist in the im-
mediate future in:
(a) raising the level and quality of
current work in drama
(b) extending the range of audience
participating in this work
(c) developing the output and demand
for the work of Australian play-
wrights.
Consideration is also being given to the
planning of a comprehensive survey of
the theatre in Australia (professional and
amateur).
The Drama Committee welcomes any com-
ments or suggestions from interested members
of the public which may assist the Committee
in its work. Correspondence should be
addressed to:

LETTING THEM KNOW
M'OST PEOPLE these days feel they
have to suffer enough blandishments
from advertising. However, advertis-
ing has many uses and one of these
can be informing the public on what
are their rights and what help and
benefits are their due.
When Government agencies are on
common ground with private enter-
prise and selling something to the
public milk, dried fruits, and so
on they can do it well. Otherwise,
it is judged more seemly to do it badly
so that it won’t appear that public
funds are being wasted. In this way
we get the Federal Treasurer natter-
ing on on TV for five minutes about
why we should invest in a loan. But
good advertising of public services—
in the elementary sense of services
to the public should be money well
spent.
The N.S.W. Public Trustee has made
a modest start with a small ad headed
“Has \our Husband Made a Will?”
It runs, “The widow of a person who
dies without a will can suffer
unnecessary hardship, delay, and worry
There is a simple remedy. Your hus-
band should make a will and so should
you. Delay is dangerous. The Public
Trustee can help you with free advice,”
then gives the address of its offices and
branches. This comes as a bit of a
shock among the pieces about lemon
hand-cream and corn-pads, but
probably not one person in a thousand
knows that this free advice is available,
and most likely the one person who
did found out too late.
TEETH FOR THE TITAN
THE Australian little-theatre movement
is not noted for adventure or experi-
ment. Characterised to a great extent
by self-indulgence, and limited by lack
of money and largely amateur talents,
it seems mostly content to satisfy
undemanding audiences of friends and
relatives.
A topical exception is Perth’s Titan
Theatre, which is proudly advertising
the “world premiere season” of a play
by an Australian writer, Miriam
Howard Wright. The first reaction to
the play, “The Wasted Years,” was
more ennui than enthusiasm, for it
trailed two other recent productions
with a similar theme.
However, fortunately for both Titan
Theatre audiences and the amateur
author, critical reaction from the Press
was favorable enough to keep the
drama afloat, and it has sailed into its
fifth week. The play deals with the
problems of a mentally retarded boy
living in the bush, and illustrates the
emotional conflicts faced by the child
and his family, accented by their
isolation.
Mrs. Wright wrote the play before
she became director of a Slow Learn-
ing Children’s Group occupational
centre for about 100 retarded children
seven years ago. Now she believes the
things she has seen prove that her ideas
were close to the truth.
Mrs. Wright is a former amateur
actress, a mother of five, and grand-
mother of 12. Four three-act and
several one-act plays preceded “The
Wasted Years,” but all were abortive.
The “West Australian’s” perspicacious
theatre critic, Donna Sadka, hit at
some of the construction, but called it
“an extremely workable play; with good
characterisations and a rough authentic
dialogue that reveals things to the
audience without explicitly telling
them.” Philip Scutt of the “Sunday
Times” was content to label it “a com-
petent piece of writing.” He, too,
praised the farm scenes because they
remained authentic without reverting to
the “fair dinkum” and “stone the crows”
cliches.
But probably the best proof of the
play’s success is its ability to attract
Perth audiences, not normally noted for
their warmth toward serious drama that
deals with modern problems close to
home.
THE GOOD WICKET
LITERATURE on cricket is in seasonal
flood. At least 20 new titles are due
into the bookstores between now and
Christmas, joining the dozens which
enjoy buoyant sales for years. For a
sport which is continually being written
off as anachronistic, it seems to be
feeding more authors than any other.
And now there is an Australian
cricket journal—“ Pavilion,” a quarterly
publication produced by the Australian
Cricket Society. The first issue,
published last month, hardly reflects
recent attempts to put more pep into
cricket through such ventures as the
world championship series, and evokes
nostalgic thoughts of village greens and
leisurely afternoons.
In a foreword, Mr. Radcliffe Grace,
the Australian Cricket Society chair-
man, writes: “This new publication
introduces to our members and to those
fortunate enough to obtain a copy by
either fair or unfair play, a new aspect
of publishing activity by members and
friends. Many cricket enthusiasts have
felt the need of a journal which may
be provocative, critical, yet not destruc-
tive or sensational, whilst being reason-
ably topical, may well be of permanent
value.”
“Pavilion’s” first contributors cer-
tainly steer well away from sensation-
alism. Such short articles as “Stanley
McCabe Golden Lad of the 19305,”
“Spin Bowling its Modern Decline,”
and “Castlemaine’s Enduring Record
and some Gay Interludes at Serious
Cricket” seem to indicate that the
journal is intent on keeping cricket sun-
dappled and soporific. j

THE DOCTRINE of the value of con-
sistent development has been so often
used to belabor adventurous spirits
wanting to leap from one mode to
another that one is suspicious of it. But
what is one to think when Dick Watkins
is leaping unconvincingly in all direc-
tions, and Earle and Hinder are the
successful epitomes of sequential
development, Hinder, indeed, moving
with assured inevitability from clear,
crisp paintings of 1933 to his luminous
kinetics.
The Central Street catalogue cover
shows a bunch of heads, one a little like
Watkins, but his is not there and he is
hard to find in this exhibition, which
tilts at nostrums on recognisable and
“Duck and Glove” by Dick Watkins ...
preaching more than painting
consistent styles. From being a leader of
the new abstraction, he has decided to
imitate the past and to parody it and
his own styles. He returns to Fauvism
with two views of the Seine, one with a
photograph of the subject pasted in the
middle, and with a huge French Land-
scape, florid, upholstered, overripe,
academic, and quite lacking in the
urgency and astringent color of the
early Matisse and Derain. In his partial
conversion to figuration, he improves
when he pastes the color toward expres-
sionism in Duck and Glove, a spar
between Horst Antes and Walt Disney,
but he seems to be preaching more than
painting.
He spoofs the idea that Lichten-
stein’s ben-day dots preserve surface flat-
ness by using them on a “tapestry”
festooned with paper strips and as
running red, blue, and green discs on
clear plastic in Seurat’s Shower Cur-
tain. Maybe he is saying that, despite
Greenberg, a painting is a veil, but
behind this one is not metaphysics but
the gallery wall. He parodies his own
use of Leger’s crispness by making him
woolly in Feenix, and in Window Box
he deliberately opposes a loose, painterly
patchiness, somewhat like Nay’s, to
stylistically incompatible black rect-
angles in order to question precepts
about surface integrity. Once you get
the point of these “in” jokes you look
for the art which is rather elusive.
Frank Hinder’s early works, whether
figurative or abstract, and his recent
luminous kinetics, indicate that he is a
compositional rather than an analytic
artist; a fluid pastel of 1961 gives a
glimpse of the full glow of his 1967-68
kinetics, and even if the dynamic, struc-
tural movements of Kandinskian works
of 1954 seem to have been lost in the
scintillation and luminosity of these
kinetics, their presence is implied.
Of the kineticists using concealed
machinery and lights to produce a
drifting surface, Hinder, whose
vaporous, expanding, sliding, undefined
areas of color move in pearly mauve
mists or golden flashes like a Turner
sunset, is best. Some are like port-
holes looking into an incandescent sea;
some move more briskly behind cor-
rugated glass, and in a pearly cylinder
ghostly shapes waft up in an endless
procession. The movements and forms
are veiled, almost soporific and quite
different from, say, Schoeffer’s rotating
aluminium poles that flash back to
light, Pol Bury’s twitching sphere, or
Graevenitz’s white cubes making short
darts across their white background.
Hinder is not concerned to surprise or
startle, for these kinetics, like all his
works, are compositions for contempla-
tion, and his latest paintings, influenced
by the kinetics and playing off mottled,
transparent, and opaque areas, have the
completeness that the art of surprise
does not attempt to attain.
Stephen Earle is using the severity of
the new abstraction to give some struc-
ture to his horticultural dabs and spots
that have been alluringly lyrical but
compositionally unresolved; in Abhasa
he puts a square of melting, floral taches
in a corner and most successfully gal-
vanises the rest of the painting with
narrow diagonal bands of red and white;
in A Measure of Seeing the floral area
is a horizontal bar with angled oblongs
jutting at it from above and below to
create something tense in the garden.
In some he is over-concerned with floral
and beribboned additives to flat, abstract
areas, but the two most impressive
works avoid this: In Between Sight
divides a bright floral area from a duller
one with a vertical floral strip in such
an enlivening way that all the blossoms
seem to have received a shower of rain;
R. B. Gardens has a blue band around
two of the painting and the rest
is covered with light green, sour green,
and pale blue dabs, which are more
loosely strewn than elsewhere and which
subtly solidify into some central bands
of color. There is a fluid ease here that

THEATRE/PHILLIP ADAMS
MILK-CHOCOLATE TEDIUM
Black and White Minstrel Show. Her
Majesty’s Theatre, Melbourne.
WHILE THE crowds stay away in
large numbers from the splendid “Wait
a Minim,” with its happily presented
theme of racial tolerance, they’re
flocking to the theatre opposite to see
this black-face farce.
Produced with the strident tawdriness
of a carnival sideshow, it presents us
with a case of theatrical miscegena-
tion, in that ersatz niggers are paired
with white minstrelettes. What, one
wonders, would Enoch Powell think?
Mind you, the men aren’t so much
black as milk-chocolate and, due to
the physical demands of all that tam-
bourine waving, reassuring traces of
pale English skin can be seen shining
through the melting Cadbury’s.
Deriving from the long-running TV
series (it’ll take another “Culloden” or
“Forsyte Saga” before I forgive the
BBC this lapse of taste), the produc-
tion was made for an audience of Alf
Garnetts and smacks of the bingo hall.
The cast mime songs of the ’forties
in telly-studio style while what could
be loosely termed a live orchestra
oompahs in the pit. Watching, one can’t
help but wonder what would happen
if the tape-recorder blew a valve: all
those white-painted lips mouthing
static.
Between outbursts of doo-dah-deying,
while the cast members rush off to
repair their runny pigmentation, a num-
ber of solo artists appear. These include
an execrable Scottish comedian
(Archie Mcßice?), who, the program
notes reveal, once made the Queen
laugh. It fails to say which Queen, but
the vintage of the jokes suggests it
was Victoria. As well, the most raucous
blonde since Betty Hutton is on hand
to bellow all Gracie Fields’ numbers
in three minutes flat, which must be a
world record.
To be fair, there is one worth-
while segment, a comedy routine
involving a live comedian and some
cleverly co-ordinated wide-screen pro-
jection. He takes the role of a pilot in
a small aeroplane on stage, while the
giant screen gives the illusion of low-
flying through London streets.
However, all in all, the production is
tedious in the extreme, and the male
cast members can consider themselves
fortunate that their identities are con-
cealed by the racial parody. Lacking
this camouflage, the girls in the show
would be well advised to aspire to the
back row of the chorus.

"PEOPLE'S WAR":
WHAT IT MEANS,
HOW IT WORKS
By PETER SAMUEL
Revolutionary Warfare and Communist
Strategy. Geoffrey Fairbairn. Faber.
$6.
IT IS VERY HARD to say anything
new or original about Communist
revolutionary warfare in general or the
Vietnam struggle, but Geoffrey Fair-
bairn succeeds. His book puts him in
the big league with four others
Bernard Fall, Douglas Pike, Denis
Duncanson, and Herman Kahn as
absolutely essential reading for anyone
seriously interested in an. understanding
of the nature of the struggle going on.
A certain' portion, perhaps a half,
consists of a consolidation and
rearrangement of material he has
already presented through a variety
of media —in lectures, journal articles,
magazines, and so on. But even for
close followers of what Mr. Fairbairn
has to say, there is a great deal of
completely new material here.
As a piece of writing, its great merit
is its method of blending theory,
example, and history. General logical
expositions are frequently laced with
descriptions of relevant experiences,
many personal ones by the author, some
by other reporters. Mr. Fairbairn’s
exposition is mostly completely clear
and precise,, but it reaches brilliant
levels in passages of reportage and con-
templation. Importantly he shows a
profound sympathy for the people of
both sides, and he paints a vivid picture
of the war as being in many ways a
tragic farce involving, on both sides,
mainly men of essential goodwill.
If he is sentimental in descriptive
pieces out with a squad of Marines on
a moonlight patrol, he is equally per-
ceptive in an analytical way when he
is expounding the method of Com-
munist revolutionary warfare. Draw-
ing from detailed studies of what has
transpired in Burma, Malaya, Indo-
nesia, Laos, the Philippines, and
Vietnam, he describes how a Com-
munist revolutionary movement
attempts to take hold of a peasant
community. It isn’t anything like the
simple pictures which the publics of
the West are given by either the
partisans of the Left or of the
Right. Needless to say, it isn’t a picture
of a benign process by which dedicated
reformers win popular support by good
deeds and gentle discussion as so
many liberals would have us believe.
But Mr. Fairbairn’s picture is also very
different from the opposite claim—that
Communist strength is based quite
simply on terror.
Rather, it is based—and this is simpli-
fying greatly—on organisation and
social conditioning. At least in the
build-up phase (later, terror may be
applied rather indiscriminately), terror
is used sparingly and with great
deliberation only after the obstacle-
person cannot be removed by any other
means. And even then the terror is
applied as much with the intention of
warning off other potential obstacles
as of getting rid of that particular man.
But in Mr. Fairbairn’s exposition, Com-
munists gain strength much more
through political and psychological war-
fare than through sheer force. They
build up and exacerbate vaguely felt
discontent, which inevitably exists in a
peasant community on one score or
another. This is amplified by a process
of agitation and focused on the social
order they wish to destroy. At the same
time as this psychological conditioning,
is going on, a cohesive “shadow society”
is being created —a network of “front”
organisations, branching out from the
spinal Party and completely smother-
ing the community with its influence
and closing it off from any alternative
outside influence.
Ultimate aims are passed off with
hurrah-words, control is gained by a
patient sequential choice of issues which
allow the many to be pitted against
Fairbairn... in the big league
the few in populist campaigns. The
legitimacy of the movement is carefully
preserved by a camouflaging of the
organisation and a constant reiteration
of its popular nature and of its spon-
taneity as a “movement.”
This, of course, is old-fashioned
Leninism in essence. But part of Mr.
Fairbairn’s theme is that Communist
revolutionary warfare in Asia has not
been more an adaptation of Leninism
to local conditions than the develop-
ment of a new technique.
Another theme which is spelt out in
some detail is that the battleground is
as much in the urban societies of the
West as it is in the villages and paddy-
fields and jungles of Asia. This is quite
banal as an assertion, of course, but
the novelty in Mr. Fairbairn’s treatment
is the extent to which he fleshes it out.
At almost every stage of the exposi-
tion there is a reference back to the
West, a discussion of the relation-
ship between the program adopted in
the village and its impact on the
minds of men in the industrial cities
of the West. Mr. Fairbairn seems to
me to be completely correct in saying
that the greatest success that Com-
munists have had has been in making
anti-Communism increasingly unfash-
ionable almost taboo among
Western elites. The test of enlighten-
ment and progressivism has become the
degree of tolerance one has for Com-
munism and its works. One can be
a racial egalitarian, a penal reformer,
an income redistributor, and an
economic planner and yet be recog-
nised in the intellectual world as a
reactionary. because of a belief that
Mr. Thieu and his colleagues deserve
support in preference to Mr. Ho and
his men. Objectively if not through
the intention of the people who con-
tribute this climate of opinion this
makes the generation of support for
resistance to Communist revolutionary
warfare very difficult.
Mr. Fairbairn makes it clear that it
is not simply the alienated leftists and
liberals who contribute to this sort of
social climate in which acquiescence to
Communist pressures is bred. The
conservative establishment of Australia
is also heavily responsible, with its
naive faith in the certainty that “great
and powerful” allies will always pro-
tect us, and what Mr. Fairbairn des-
cribes as “the old gormless belief in
Australia as a privileged New Jerusalem
for white men.” It is this sort of
gormlessness, surely, which allows
people to think that Australia has a
real option of retraction into a “Fort-
ress Australia,” as opposed to a policy
of active regional involvement in
South-East Asia.
The bulk of the book—the examina-
tion of the nature of revolutionary
warfare in South-East Asia and it's rela-
tionship with the local political scene—
is an important and valuable contribu-
tion, and fhis reviewer, anyway, cannot
fault it. It is, however, where Mr.
Fairbairn touches on prescription that
he is less convincing. He doesn’t discuss
policy as such, but a number of passing
remarks at different places in the book
bear on policy. There is first the impli-
cation that the choice in South-East
Asia for the West is a black-white one
of total involvement or total disengage-
ment.
The “limited war” approach of the
United States in Vietnam is certainly
open to criticism. Limited and match-
ing responses to an enemy build-up
have the obvious disadvantage of allow-
ing him time to stay ahead, and the
continual public emphasis'on the search
for a settlement, and a solution which is
a negotiated compromise, causes a con-
siderable morale problem. It is much
simpler to enlist support for our side


if we say we are out to win than if we
admit it is a halfhearted defensive
effort. On the other hand, anything
else does involve risks of escalation
and enlargement of conflict. Even if
these risks are sometimes exaggerated,
they have to be considered in a
balancing-up exercise.
Secondly, the extent to which Western
assistance will be needed in order to
meet the challenge of Communist
revolutionary warfare will vary from
situation to situation, a point which
Mr. Fairbairn does not spell out. And
in some cases —Burma and Cambodia
are possible examples—we may simply
decide not to get involved at all. Either
they meet the challenge themselves or
they get knocked over; in which case,
at least, the credibility of Western
assistance is not jeopardised.
Mr. Fairbairn does not actually say
that unlimited and undifferentiated
Western assistance and unyielding resist-
ance on the part of non-Communists,
are the only answers, but many people
will read his book that way. His failure
to discuss these policy issues specifically
will contribute to that. But these are
minor points, because Mr. Fairbairn’s
main attempt is not to argue policy
but to expound the method of Com-
munist revolutionary warfare. And one
of his main themes is that the method
applied in the paddies and jungles is
closely adapted to the misunderstand-
ings of people in the cities of the West.
Any improvement in the Western
policy response will be heavily depen-
dent on increased understanding on our
part, to which the book is a valuable
contribution.
ANZAC ANSWERS
By ROBERT O'NEILL
The Anzac Battalion in Vietnam
1967-68, 2 Vols., Edited by Major
K. E. Newman. Printcraft Press, $2O.
THESE TWO volumes, in their well-
designed protective sleeve, must com-
prise the most lavishly produced record
of service of any unit of the Australian
Army, or, for that matter, most other
armies. The Anzac Battalion was formed
in Vietnam by an amalgamation of the
Second Battalion, The Royal Australian
Regiment, with several companies of
the First Battalion, The Royal New
Zealand Regiment, who were stationed
at various times in Phuoc Tuy Province.
The Second Battalion, R.A.R., returned
from Vietnam only in June last and so
their book represents the most up-to-
date and comprehensive record we have
of the war in and around Phuoc Tuy
during the second year of Australian
action in the province. Any second year
of the same task, performed by a differ-
ent group of men to those of the first
year, poses peculiar problems, but 1968
has been a very special year for South
Vietnam, the White House, and the
Pentagon, because of the Tet offensive.
Hence, it is particularly interesting to
have this record of Australian answers
to the latest Viet Cong strategy, together
with detailed reports of the achieve-
ments and losses of each operation
undertaken.
The first volume, of 175 pages, sum-
marises the activities of the battalion
on operations, lists its personnel,
includes extracts from its newspaper
“Ringo,” published at Nui Dat, and
contains nearly 100 pages of photo-
graphs. In his foreword, the Command-
ing Officer, Lt.-Col. Charlesworth, says:
“We did not wish to record military
history, or make military comment on
the operations in which we participated,
but rather to summarise the events
factually.” This statement is a fair
resume of the book, but this is not to
say that Vietnam pundits can afford to
ignore it, for while bare-boned statistics
do not make an absorbing narrative,
they sometimes form a useful adjunct
to debates on Australian involvement
in. Vietnam.
At the end of the 30-page resume of
operations is a comparative table which
shows, for each operation, those aspects
which lend themselves to such presenta-
tion: own and enemy casualty losses,
Viet Cong weapons captured, food
stocks destroyed, and bases put out of
action. On first glance, these results are
very impressive, e.g., 28 Anzacs killed
against 187 Viet Cong dead. However,
of these 28, eight wore killed during
patrols and incidents around the Nui
Dat base, while these same actions cost
the Viet Cong only 11 lives. These
figures might point to a weakness in
base security techniques. The Viet Cong
score, by comparison with the overall
figure, might incline the local Viet Cong
commander to concentrate on this type
of activity, rather than to attempt more
spectacular victories in large-scale opera-
tions such as Tet, when the Anzac
Battalion killed 91 Viet Cong at a cost
of seven lives. However, such military
sophistry is not likely to interest the
general reader, who is trying to appraise
the worth of Australian involvement in
Vietnam. What this reader needs is
some assessment of what the inhabitants
of Phuoc Tuy think about their political
future and of how this thought pattern
is influenced by Australian operations—
two quite separate questions but both of
crucial importance in Australian politics,
and to which the Australian Govern-
ment ought to provide a clear and
public answer.
The second volume, containing maps
which show where the battalion went,
when, how, and what Viet Cong they
met on their operations, is possibly of
more permanent worth for historical
purposes than the first volume. The
maps are reproductions of the 1:50,000
survey of Vietnam and are the most
accurate available. On these maps are
superimposed the movements and
encounters of each operation—a rich
magazine of fact for any Hawk or Dove
with pretensions to be a military strate-
gist and analyst.
Throughout the book one’s attention
is drawn to the high quality of Major
Newman’s editorship. From a technical
point of view, this book is a production
of unusually high merit by Australian
standards. Of course, Printcraft Press
deserve some of the credit, particularly
for the fine printing job and for the
binding. However, the editor deserves
commendation not only for the standard
of the writing, but for the layout, the
art work, the photograph selection, and
the typography. There is no trace of any
amateurism in the production of this
most ambitious record of the war, and
it is to be hoped that it will become a
standard to be aimed at by other
battalions.
However, such works are of signifi-
cance largely to the men who served in
the battalion and to their families. They
are not in themselves history, nor do
they contain many of the essential
elements of a history. In the light of
the recent deaths of Dr. C. E. W. Bean
and Mr. Gavin Long, it is perhaps
timely to remember that no provision
has been made for the continuance of
their tradition after 1945, despite the
four wars in which the Australian forces
have fought since then. Will we ever
get a history of these wars of compar-
able standard with the works of Bean
and Long? Time is slipping by, mem-
ories are dying, and records are being
destroyed through ignorance. Coming
generations are no less likely to criticise
and question Australian involvement in
the Vietnam War than in either of the
World Wars.
CENTURY OF CHANGE
By ERNEST BRAMSTED
Britain in the Century of Total War.
War, Peace and Social Change,
1900-1987. Arthur Marwick. The
Bodley Head. $7.70.
MARWICK TELLS us little about
generals and battles, about the causes of
two world wars, but a lot on their
consequences, on the immense impact
they made upon ordinary men and
women, upon all aspects of British
society. Two total wars, the author
argues, affected British society in four
modes: firstly, there was “destruction,”
which often led to an enforced recon-
struction in an area otherwise little
touched by change. Secondly, you had
a process of which an example is:
whereas there was neglect of the
internal combustion engine in Edwardian
times, the necessities of World War I
led to the creation of one of the
world’s foremost motor-car industries
in England; similarly it needed
World War II to bring about a
shake-up of the country’s stagnant
educational system; Mr. R. A. B.
Butler’s English Education Act of
1944 was undreamed of in 1939.
Thirdly, there was what Marwick
terms “the military participation” in the
war of new groups and classes which
previously had played only second or
third fiddle in society.
It is a fact that only after having
worked hard in hospitals and munitions
factories in World War I did the women

Eden and Churchill ... “British knew
in their bones”
in England (and for that matter in
Germany) secure the vote. The same
happened to the French women after
World War 11, while in Switzerland,
a country that managed to stay neutral
in both wars, to the present day,
women are not admitted to the polling
booths.
In England the employment of women
in transport, in clerical, commercial,
administrative, and educational jobs
rose phenomenally between 1914 and
1918; for instance, in banking and
finance the 9500 female employees of
1914 had become 63,700 by 1917. The
rise of the businessgirl, of the shorthand-
typist goes back to the days when the
men filled the trenches of Flanders
and northern France.
In World War II women’s involve-
ment was similar, with the dif-
ference that then their conscription for
war work became a fact. As a result,
the figure of 7000 women employed
in Government ordinance factories in
1939 had by October, 1944, increased
to 770,000. Incidentally, it had been
expected that where women took the
place of men it would require three
women to do the work of two men, but
in fact a one-to-one replacement proved
quite feasible, partly because through
the assistance of modern technology
sheer physical strength was now less
essential to industrial work.
The two wars also raised the social
and political position of the working
classes, although, in this, World War II
was more significant than World War I.
Only then, in the words of A. J. P.
Taylor, “the British people came of
age.” It is true that as a result of
World War I the trade unions and the
Labor Party became factors to be
reckoned with, but the real substance
of politics changed little.
This system was only seriously chal-
lenged and shaken by Hitler’s onslaught
on the country. From World War II
Labor drew “a double dividend.” From
the day it joined the Churchill Govern-
ment in 1940, Labor took part in many
important decisions and shared the
credit for them. Yet, at the same time,
the Labor Party continued to hold its
annual conferences, and sometimes
passed resolutions somehow critical of
the status quo and the Government.
It presented itself as a Party with an
alternative policy for the future. On
the one hand it was largely the influence
of the leaders of the Trade Unions
Council and of the Minister of
Reconstruction, Arthur Greenwood,
which led to the famous Beveridge
Report of 1942, “Full Employment in
a Free Society.” On the other hand,
Labor was able to attract much-
disgruntled middle-class opinion by
working on the contrast between the
participation of the masses in the war
effort and the continuation of so many
traditional Conservative attitudes. More-
over, Labor had well-thought-out plans
of reforms that appealed particularly
to the thousands of ex-servicemen and
other members of the younger genera-
tion.
Marwick’s fourth category is “the
emotional impact of war.” The war-
time promise of “home fit for heroes”
was never implemented, certainly not
by the hard-faced men who entered
the house of Commons after the
“Coupon” election of 1918; yet, seen
in historic perspective, a new code of
social mores did come into being. Class
divisions and gross inequalities in wealth
and opportunity remained, yet the
trend toward greater homogeneity in
behaviour continued.
Mass production and mass media con-
tributed to greater standardisation of
fashion and of environment. Tl\e “Daily
Mail” Ideal Home Exhibition, held in
London in" March, 1923, had three
special features reflecting the trend and
taste of the time: a bungalow town, a
wireless section—the BBC had begun
its transmissions only a few months
earlier and an Egyptian handicrafts
section.
The last was in the wake of the craze
for all things Egyptian after the mass
newspapers had reported the unearth-
ing at Luxor of the tomb of the
Pharaoh Tutankhamen. What before
1914 had only reached the eyes and
ears of a limited few, often educated
in the elite schools of the type of Eton
and Harrow, now reached a much
wider community, even if vulgarised.
At the same time the pull of the “old
school tie” continued.
Yet, while the elitist trend was main-
tained, democracy had made a real
advance in World War 11. One month
after Dunkirk, “The Times” wrote
prophetically: “If we speak of democ-
racy, we do not mean a democracy
which maintains the right to vote
but forgets the right to work and the
right to live ... If we speak of equality,
we do not mean a political equality
nullified by social and economic
privilege.”
It was this trend which led to a
nation-wide insurance system and, after
the war, under the brilliant and relent-
less drive of Aneurin Bevan, to the
establishment of the National Health
Service. Prime Minister Attlee wrote
in the preface to the Government’s
“Economic Survey for 1947” that the
Labor Government believed in planning
but also believed in democracy. Mar-
wick rightly sees in this the basic
dilemma: “the inherent conflict between
central planning and full individual
liberty as traditionally conceived in

LITERARY CONTEST
A LITERARY competition with
two awards totalling $4OOO will be
conducted by the “Advertiser,”
Adelaide, South Australia, as one
of the early features of the sixth
Adelaide Festival , of Arts, in 1970.
For a book (non-fiction), $2OOO.
For a novel, $2OOO.
Entries must be original unpub-
lished works, and the competition
is open to residents of Australia,
those of Australian birth wherever
resident, and residents of any
other country provided the entry is
on an Australian subject or has an
Australian background.
Entries will close with the
“Advertiser” on December 1, 1969,
and results will be announced just
before the opening of the Festival in
March, 1970.
Britain was one the Labor Government
was unable to resolve.”
However, helped by much greater
educational opportunity, there has been
in post-war Britain a marked improve-
ment in social mobility from one class
to another. The middle-class continued
to swell and the working-class con-
tinued to shrink. Some of the grosser
income inequalities before 1939 were
wiped out by the high taxation both
of the war period and by successive
postwar Labor Governments, although
at least between the ’thirties and ’fifties
there was little change in the inequality
of property distribution. In the 1960 s
the widespread affluence contrasts with
the imbalance of payments, the need
to export more and to import less. It
also goes side by side with the reduced
power-status of Britain in a changed
world.
There is one major weakness in this
valuable survey. Too little space is
given to British attitudes toward
foreign affairs and issues. For instance,
although the Peace Ballot of 1934-5 is
briefly mentioned, the immense sig-
nificance of the “League of Nations
Union,” that very British institution
with its noble but doctrinaire belief
in collective security and its member-
ship of more than 1,000,000 in 1933,
has not been considered. Similarly, Mr.
Marwick has not sufficiently emphasised
that by ignoring the plea of Jean
Monnet, that great French planner for
Europe, Britain missed the bus into
Europe in 1951 when she refused to
join the European Coal and Steel Com-
munity, the forerunner of the European
Common Market.
Both Tories and Labor were at fault.
“The British knew in their bones,” Sir
Anthony Eden claimed in 1952, “that
they could never join a European
federation.” Previously delegates from
both British Parties in the European
Assembly at Strasbourg had looked like
benevolent uncles upon the German-
French rapprochement; they felt that
only advice, not joining, was the proper
British answer to the new integration of
Western Europe.


Cellar notes
from
Lindeman’s
DURING RECENT years great advances
have been made in champagne making
motivated largely by the steadily in-
creasing costs of manual operations.
In the “METHOEJE CHAMPENOISE”
process the traditional French method
—a suitable base Dry White Wine blend,
known as the Cuvee, is mixed with sugar
and yeast and then bottled. A strong
metal clip called the agrafe is attached
to the head of the bottle to prevent the
carbon dioxide gas, generated within
the wine by fermentation of the sugar
by the yeast, blowing out the cork.
After fermentation is completed, the new
champagne is held for ageing, the actual
period depending on the selling price of
the wine and its quality. However, one
to three years is the general period.
The next operation is to rid the wine of
its yeast sediment, and this is achieved
by a process of riddling or shaking,
whereby the individual, bottles are placed
upside-down on special racks and daily
shaken over a period of six to twelve
weeks. During this process the yeast sedi-
ment is gradually consolidated in the
neck of the bottle immediately above the
cork.
Now the yeast is expelled from the bottle
by disgorging removal of the agrafe
allows the gas pressure in the bottle to
blow out the cork, sediment and some
wine. The actual process is made slightly
easier by freezing the necks of the bottles
in a special refrigerator whereby the
sediment is set in ice. Any disgorging
losses are then made good by topping the
bottles with similar wine, and they are
then re-corked and hooded with wire
muselets, again to prevent the gas pres-
sure from blowing out the corks.
We estimate that each bottle undergoes
up to two hundred individual operations
by skilled workers, and obviously such
champagne must be expensive.
Today Lindemans are marketing a lower
priced Champagne named Golden Velvet
achieved by mechansing various
functions, etc. and two Champagnes
made by the true “Methode Cham-
penoise.”
The first of these is our Private Cuvee
Champagne, a vintage wine fermented
in the bottle in which it is sold, and the
second, a new release, Reserve Cuvee
Champagne, a 1965 Vintage wine, winner
of several Gold and Silver Medals at
various Australian Wine Shows.

SEEING THE HUNTER
IN SIX HOURS
AND HOME BY FOUR
SOME LITTLE time ago a wine-
writing colleague of mine predicted that
the Hunter Valley vineyard area was
soon to become a major tourist
attraction. You know, something like
the heurigen of Vienna, wine, women,
and song, cold sausage and a warm
smile; Beethoven lived here, or was it
“Banjo” Paterson? My colleague went
on about the paved roads and the pretty
little wineries and the feature restaur-
ants and the new expressway. He pointed
out that Pokolbin was almost a suburb
ctf Sydney and that soon you would be
able to get up there in less than two
hours. He also mentioned that the air-
port of Cessnock, which is actually in
the heart of the vineyard area, would
be a veritable hive of activity, with
small commercial planes buzzing in and
out like hive bees.
Well, I went up there last week
with Thunderbird Aviation, who call
themselves a commuter airline. They
have started a service to bring the
vineyards to the people. And all in six
hours’ total time. We left Mascot at
ten in the morning and were there
within a half hour. Johnny Walker,
one of the founders of the Wine and
Food Society of New South Wales, told
me on the trip that he first went to
the Hunter nearly 40 years ago. He left
Sydney by boat, and arrived in New-
castle in the morning, after sleeping on
board. They picked up a car and
eventually arrived at Pokolbin, the whole
journey taking some 20 hours.
Even 30 minutes can be thirst-
making, so we were driven straight to
McWilliams to taste some wines. The
Hunter Valley is dry, and so were we.
You can’t do much about the former,
but a ’66 Mount Pleasant Riesling and
a ’6l Anne fixed the latter. The Anne
Riesling is the top wine of the Lovedale
Vineyard, which is the next paddock
to the airport. This particular vintage
was always rather acid. After five years
in the bottle, the acid has softened and
the wine has grown to balance it. It’s
now a first-class old white, showing
lots of life, and it will undoubtedly live
for years yet. I don’t think the Elizabeth
will go quite the same distance. It’s a
fuller wine and will probably be at its
best in a couple of years’ time.
After a tour of the winery we had
luncheon between the five-gallon and
300-gallon casks. Somehow it always
tastes better in such a setting. I enjoyed
their latest wine from the Riverina
district, which has pleasant fruit and
plenty of oak showing through, giving
it a slightly nutty character. So they
called it Nutty Claret. No comment.
Their 1965 Phillip Hermitage, which is
now the standard Mount Pleasant red,
is starting to show all the development
in the bottle that I predicted, and will
be very good drinking in another three
or four years. Which didn’t stop me
depleting present stocks. I was also
very impressed with the ’64 Mount
Pleasant Pinot Hermitage. This wine
was released in small quantities last
year and there may be another issue
in a few months’ time. It has a tre-
mendous varietal nose, powerful with-
out being merely voluminous, if you
know what I mean, and the flavor is
getting all that rich and earthy (yet
at the same time light and delicate)
character we so rarely meet these days.
Champagne, of course, after lunch,
and I don’t care whence it cometh.
A slight delay to get to the next winery,
Drayton’s Bellevue, for an inspection
of their new wines. Reg Drayton was
patiently waiting, he’s been through
this sort of thing fairly often before.
From the cask, I liked their ’6B caber-
net blend, which will be on the market
in a couple of years’ time, and a
fairly big hermitage that is in a big
cask in a corner. The ’6B whites are in
bottle and are good buying at around
a dollar a bottle. One number I seem
to remember is 838 and another is
802. The latter was not generally liked
by a few of us privileged to taste when
it was made (and before it was cleaned
up), but it is now showing very well
with a clean acid finish and plenty of
that full Drayton flavor that they get
in their whites. We also had a chance
to look at the Bin 550 of ’65 and the
650 of ’66. The 550 is drinking ex-
tremely well, though it will still im-
prove, and the 650 needs many, many
years yet. These were big years in the
Hunter. (The 750 is now available and
worth buying.)
Suitably fortified for the journey
back, we took off at 3.30 p.m. Thunder-
bird are going to do this sort of thing
every fortnight and I wish them great
success. Total cost for the trip, and
this does include lunch and tastings, is
only $22.20 per person.
I’m all for a bit of wine debunking
now and then, so I was therefore
amused to hear the other day of a
group of dedicated wine men who first
met in London. They are mostly
medical, and were over there post-
graduating or something. They invited
a famous surgeon to be their patron,
and he presided at the first dinner. His
first question, which was something to
do with the anatomy of an emu, left
them first astonished, then helpless with
laughter. Whereupon they named their
society after his question, and only
abbreviated it to the letters MUA when
they struck their first label. They also
retained their humor and ideals, for
their motto is “if wine is missing, life
is lacking.” Which in latin is “Si vino
caremus ars etiam abest.” Which also
retains something of the question.
In your interests I went to a beer-
tasting not so long ago. I feel that you
should know if there is anything hap-
pening in the beer world. There was
a range of local and imported beers
as well as a collection of home brews.

aging a Toohey’s plant, was also there.
His comments were most illuminating.
Apparently you may get a brewer’s
licence fairly easily if you wish to
do it yourself. I believe there is some
undertaking about not selling it. Some
of the people present had attempted
to make their own. One effort was poor,
and the off-odors and imbalances were
easy to detect. The second maker had
one a much better job. His two recent
brews were of high standard. <
To make them, he collects various
grams, blends them, and allows them
to germinate. After which the grain
is dried, milled, and balanced, then held
m, the balancing liquid for twenty
minutes at 178 degrees F. This extracts
the carbohydrate. The liquid is run
off, seeded with the yeast culture, and
the hops are added. Into an enclosed
p astic container, and away she goes.
Thence filtration, after fermentation is
comp ete. One may reliqueur for
secondary fermentation in/ the bottle,
or bo tie before the mffial ferment has
g n roug ore am carbon dioxide.
His older beers, made m April 68,
were over the hill and rather poor, but
the two. new brews were very good,
tasty drinking. Total price, about seven
cents per bottle. Apparently the flavor
in beer comes from the hops and not
from the grain. What was most inter-
esting to me was that hops have a
varietal character as grapes do, and
that economic factors beset the brew-
ing of good beer. The resin in the hops
gives the flavor. Or, rather, flavors.
Chemical analysis has identified 143
different flavor constituents in this resin,
and there are probably thirty or forty
more as yet unlocated.
There are factors in the resin called
Alpha and Beta. One needs about
three to four pounds of these factors
to flavor 5000 gallons of beer. But that
three or four pounds may be found
j n 1201 b. of a certain variety of hops,
whereas 2501 b. of another variety may
be ne eded to yield the same quantity.
So t be local brewers are inclined to go
for the 1201 b. variety. But the finer,
more delicate flavor may be found in
the second type. So the old compromise
Q f quality and quantity has to be made.
And if we imported btetter-flavored
hops we would have to pay even more
because of certain tariffs.
The f act rema i ns that our tasting of
the commercially brewed beers revealed
the l ac i c 0 f character in the Australian
examples. Most of them were too sweet
and a number just i acked flavor
altogether. One famous beer was con-
demned by all. A couple of these beers
may have suffered from being too long
in the bottle, but there was nothing to
be said for even the best of them,
other than that it was light and
pleasant. The imported beers had much
more flavor and character. Though the
tasting was conducted as a masked one,
everyone picked overseas styles quite
easily.
A couple of them were fairly
ordinary. Len Garvey knew all about
them, and pointed out that the world-
famous brewers who made them bought
their hops with an economic eye, too,
and imported them from Canada,
China, and even Australia to blend
with local varieties. The great German
makers, however, particularly Lowen-
brau and Hofbrau, went to endless
trouble with their hops, and obtained
them only from a quality point of view,
The best varieties of hops coming from
Saaz, Bavaria, and Styria, I think it
was, in Yugoslavia. So, if any of you
beer-drinkers really want to do the
thing properly, why don’t you start
your own hopyard?
Finally, I have been regarding the
Adelaide Wine Show results of 1968.
Of the 11 Gold Medals awarded, five
were won by the smaller companies:
Norman’s of the Barossa Valley won
one each in the two dry red classes of
Claret and Burgundy, the Stanley Wine
Company did the same in the Hock
and Rose dasses> and Osborne’s of
McLaren Vale took another Burgundy
Gold, repeating their success of last
year
t • •
I think this is a marvellous thing for
.. m °ustry. Andre Simon, after his
some y ears ago, wrote that
he saw little hope for the survival of
the small maker. I disagreed with him
then and still do today, but I know that
nothing would please him more than
this latest result.

Australian films
Denis O’Brien cautiously believes the
climate has been improved for Austra-
lian film-makers recently (8., October
19) because of heated discussion sub-
sequent to the N.S.W. Chief Secretary’s
proclamation on the proposed enforce-
ment of the obligations by distributors
and exhibitors demanded by the 1935
Cinematographic Act. Yet, I wonder?
There is considerable production
going on in Australian film studios,
mostly financed with overseas money,
both on a solo and co-operative basis,
which has nothing to do with the Act.
It is production that several astute and
industrious managements have connived
by deft salesmanship, to the applause
of everyone within the industry. It is
the only semi-continuous feature-film
production to have occurred in Australia
since the ’thirties, and it has been
achieved in spite of the languishing
state of affairs that has dominated
certain aspects of the business for a
generation. It indicates that Australian
artists and technicians, with the facili-
ties, are perfectly capable of achieving
professional quality in film production
if given the opportunity.
But this frenetic activity doesn’t con-
stitute a genuine Australian film
industry: the production of Australian
films aimed at Australian audiences,
with overseas potentials as a fringe-
benefit. And, as we all know, Australia
is one of the very few nations without
such an industry. We part with a large
lump of revenue to overseas producers
every year, and cripple a major medium
of national inter-communication.
The distributors and exhibitors declare
they are meeting the demands of the
Act; say they are perfectly willing to
screen any Australian films available,
and will continue to do so. However,
following the proclamation, the dis-
tributors are likely to find there simply
will not be 12 features available to
them to screen in 1968-69.
Local investors are difficult to find.
We are assured that once a film is pro-
duced locally it will find distribution,
and we assume distribution ensuring a
just degree of financial success accord-
ing to the film’s merits. Yet, somehow,
the whole recent history of film pro-
duction in Australia suggests this risk
isn’t worth it; that a producer could go
out on a limb with a hefty investment
without any corresponding guarantee of
returns. A depression settled on the
Australian production industry about 30
years ago, around the same time that
the majority of distributors decided not
to invest in local production.
It is a film-business adage that a
production should never be initiated
without definite, prearranged distribu-
tion, arranged usually through the dis-
tributing company’s direct participation
in the production, and thereby his say

in its control. In so speculative an
investment, where each product is an
untested proto-type demanding original
marketing, it would be foolhardy to go
ahead without the participation and
advice of the marketing organisation:
the distributor.
For a nation with one of the world’s
most avid cinema-going audiences,
increasing year by year, and a very
satisfactory market potential, Australia
seems tardy in not investigating such a
profitable home market and potential
foreign-exchange earner. The basic

Un-won West
Your article on “Winning the West”
(8., October 12) was rather one-sided.
Yes, Mr. Gorton made a good impres-
sion in the various ways that your
correspondent states. But no, he did not
win the politically unoriented.
One occurrence of his tour has had
far more ink spilt on it than any other
the gross exceeding of our speed
limit, en route to Buribury, by his
police-escorted party. Western Austra-
lia has a very high death and injury
rate on its roads, and this is still rising.
There is a blanket speed limit of 65
mph on all highways. Our Prime Min-
ister considered his appointments suffi-
ciently important to go at 75 mph, even
though the delay was caused by himself,
in “calling for unscheduled stops, to
talk with children.”
No, Mr. Gorton did not have an
unqualified “win” too many people
here were infuriated by this blatant
evidence of selfishness and disrespect
for the laws of our State.

Investor strikes back
Your article “Goodbye to a high price
oil policy” is typical of many I have
read. They all overlook one thing. An
agreement was drawn up, the conse-
quences of which should have been
foreseen. The fact that these conse-
quences turned out to be unpleasant
was no excuse for tearing up the
agreement. If I tore up a hire-purchase
agreement because I thought that the
company was charging me too much,
I’d end up in court and I don’t think
I’d get much of a hearing.
' The Australian Government has
shown that it is not to be trusted, and
investors will not forget it. One can
only hope that there will be no Gov-
ernment participation in phosphate
production. I, for one, will exit from
that situation at the first sign of Gov-
ernment agreements on the subject.
