Some practical reasons why Hudson’s
Eurnenthol Tooth Powder should be
used for the Preservation of the Teeth.
BECAUSE it contains the Germicidal and
Antiseptic virtues that have made Eumen-
thol Jujubes famous the world over.
BECAUSE it is not only an Antiseptic and
Germicide, but cleanses mechanically,
owing to the evolution of oxygen when in
contact with water or moisture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the
Teeth so wonderfully, and wards off decay
as no other preparation for the Teeth
can or will do.

Eugenics
The Red page
“If it were not the mission of social
hygiene to bring a new joy and a new free-
dom into life,” writes that authority upon
the psychology of sex, Havelock Ellis, in The
Task of Social Hygiene (Constable, per
Dymoek’s Library), “I should not have
concerned myself with the writing of this
book.” Eugenics does not mean breeding
mankind as cattle are bred: —
It is the task of social hygiene not only to
make sewers, but to re-make love, and to do
both in the same large spirit of human fel-
lowship, to ensure finer individual develop-
ment and a larger social organisation. At
the one end, social hygiene may be regarded
as simply the extension of an elementary
sanitary code; at the other end, it seems to
some to have in it the glorious freedom of a
new religion.
£
Havelock Ellis brings clear thinking into
the complicated questions of the day, and
attacks the muddy generalisations that pass,
in social questions, for the established ver-
dict of truth. Thus the argument that as
the good stocks of upper social class are
decreasing in fertility, and the bad stocks of
lower social class are not decreasing, there-
fore the bad stocks are tending to replace
the good stocks, is vitiated by the assump-
tion that, the best stocks are necessarily the
stocks of high social class. The truth is
that families at the top of culture and re-
finement tend to die out, even without any
deliberate restraint from procreation. The
lamp of a civilised community burns at the
top, but is constantly replenished from the
bottom.
Havelock Ellis has a sound belief in the
value of control of reproduction, against
which the half-baked scientists of the world
fulminate by stigmatising it as “racial
suicide.” Limitation of offspring is de-
manded in the altruistic interest of the in-
dividuals composing the race. He contem-
plates a falling birth-rate with admiration.
A high birth-rate is always associated with
a high infant mortality; the ideal, almost
reached in Australasia, is a low birth-rate
combined with a lower death-rate.
A community which is reproducing itself
rapidly must always be in an unstable state
ot disorganisation, highly unfavorable to the
welfare of its members, and especially of the
ndw-comers; a community which is repro-
ducing itself slowly is in a stable and organ-
ised condition which permits it to undertake
adequately the guardianship of its new mem-
bers.. The high infantile mortality of the com-
munity with a high birth-rate merely means
that that community is unconsciously mak-
ing a violent and murderous effort to attain
to the more stable and organised level of the
country with a low birth-rate In Norway
and in Australasia we see a large natural in-
crease, effected not by a profuse expenditure
of mostly wasted births, but by an economy
in deaths, and the increase thus effected is
accompanied by highly favorable social con-
ditions, and great national vigor.
Measured by the fairest test of a country’s
well-being, as regards its actual vitality,
that is, by dividing the square of the death-
rate by the birth-rate, Australia stands higher
than Norway, while Maoriland has attained
“the nearest approach to immortality yet on
record.”
Japan has no such record to show. The
infantile mortality is much more than double
that of Maoriland, and it has rapidly risen
during the last decade. The death-rate has
similarly risen, and has continued to
rise despite a slight decline in the birth-rate.
“We see here a tendency to the sinister com-
bination of a falling birth-rate with a rising
death-rate. It is obvious that such a ten-
dency, if continued, will furnish a serious
problem to Japanese social reformers, and
at the same time make it impossible for
Western alarmists to regard the rise of
Japan as a menace to the world.”
A falling birth-rate does not, in itself,
mean degeneration and disaster. And it is
suggested that, from a review of zoological
e yolution in the human race, especially under
civilised conditions, a large family means a
reversion to the tendencies that prevail
among lower organisms. A large family
means that the mother, it might almost be
said, is not so far from the fish, which
spawns her ova by the million. A large
human family, it has been suggested, con-
stitutes a symptom of degeneration. Large
families, too, usually occur in the patho-
logical and abnormal classes, among the in-
sane, the feeble-minded, the criminal, the
consumptive, the alcoholic, etc. The man
that hath his quiver full is a degenerate!
The great English colonies find it difficult
to. realise that they are not really new coun-
tries, but branches of old countries, and
already nearing maturity when they began
their separate lives. They are not at the be-
ginning of 2000 years of slow development,
such as we have passed through, but at the
end of it, with us, and sometimes even a
little ahead of us. It is, therefore, natural
and inevitable that, in a matter in which we
are moving rapidly, Massachusetts and On-
tano and New South Whales and Maoriland
should have moved still more rapidly, so
rapidly indeed, that they have themselves
failed to perceive that their real natural in-
crease, and the manner in which it is at-
tained, place them in this matter in the van
of civilisation.
And a declining birth-rate is not a merely
temporary tendency, but a great fundamental
law of civilisation. Though, 50 years ago,
h ranee seemed to present a striking contrast
to other countries in her low and gradually
falling birth-rate, to-day, though she has
reached an almost stationary position, the
birth-rates of all other countries have fallen
in toward her level, and France is seen
merely to have been the leader in a move-
ment which is common to all the more
highly civilised nations. The questions of
virtue and vice cannot affect this tendency:
with high civilisation fertility invari-
ably diminishes. And the ' declining birth-
rate of civilised lands will alone largely
serve in the end to eliminate warfare, partly
by removing one of its causes, the necessity
for the overflowing of an over-populated ter-
ritory, partly because the increased value of
human life will make war too costly.
Havelock Ellis has here a useful contribu-
tion, because a scientifically-based contribu-
tion, to the question of the teaching of re-
ligion in schools:—
For the most part the ideas of religion
cannot be accepted or assimilated by chil-
ie ? were n °t made by children or for
children, but represent the feelings, thoughts
and experiences of men, and sometimes of
very exceptional and abnormal men.... The
child who grows devout and becomes anxious
about the state of his soul is a morbid and
unwholesome child.... The usual effect of
constantly imparting to children an instruct-
\ n £, tle y a ? e not yet ready to receive is to
deaden their sensibilities to the whole sub-
of religion. If it were not so, England,
after 60 years of National Schools, ought to
be a devout nation of good Church people'
In dealing with the question of immorality
* aw > the author shows how all
efforts to curb prostitution by legislative
enactments not only fail, but more securely
establish the very vice they aim to extir-
pate He analyses the effect of the closing
°f disorderly houses in New York. This
simply means that the dispossessed women
must find homes in tenement houses, bring-
ing them into closer contact with the families
inhabiting these houses. As it is an offence
to harbor the prostitute, she has to pay
twice as high a rent as the ordinary tenant.
This compels her to greater effort in her
trade. She has also often to pay the police
to refrain from molesting her. Thus she is
sui rounded by people whom the law encour-
ages to prey on her. She has to earn more,
to feed the sharks who surround her. Re-
move the anti-vice laws, and the rents would
automatically fall; but property is too deeply
interested in keeping its rents up to allow
the arrival of that remote contingency. The
reason why the laws against vice fail is, in
Havelock Ellis’s opinion, because there is no
unanimity of opinion on matters of morals, as
there is in regard to crime.
To point out that prostitution never has
been, and never can be, abolished by law, is
by no means to affirm that it is an evil which
must endure for ever, and that no influence
can affect it Prostitution is closely re-
lated to marriage; and any reforms in prosti-
tution, therefore, can only follow a reform
in our marriage system. But prostitution
is also related to economics, and when it is
realised how much has to be altogether
changed in our whole social system to secure
even an approximate abolition of prostitu-
tion, it becomes doubtful whether many
people are willing to pay the price of re-
moving the “social evil” they find it so easy
to deplore.
In a useful essay, “The War Against
war, the author indicates the chief ten-
dencies which—in the far future, be it re-
membered—will obviate the need of war
The chief is : <•
The natural exhaustion of the war-like

stocks are naturally killed out, and
ntdd left to the unwarlike. Those who
fight and run away liye to fight another day ;
more so, those who never fight at all; and
they transmit their prudence to their off-
spring. J?he English cannot now b<3 described
as a warlike people; the warlike stocks have
been killed out, and the adventurous ele-
ments have been driven out as emigrants by
the reckless and unchecked increase of the
population which occurred during the first
three-quarters of last century. “Those reck-

mada were long ago exterminated; an ad-
mirably prudent and cautious race has been

the solitary descendants of that warlike
stock only in the Dominions of the Empire.
. T be other tendencies are: The growth of
international opinion, the most startling
evidence of which was the chorus of con-
demnation when Ferrer was shot at Bar-
celona ; international financial development *
the decreasing pressure of population; the
growth of the anti-military spirit, as evi-
denced by the insurrectional socialist move-
ment, with its threatened counter-stroke of
an anti-military general strike; and the
overgrowth of armaments.
I s ™ 11 tO . remem ber, while considering
fuhhty of the Hague Tribunal, and
of Geese Societies in general, that the
settlement of international disputes cannot
be achieved by .general disarmament; it can
only be achieved by force. Thus there can
be no question of disarmament at present—
we can only go on building our fleet, with
the sad certainty that it is not destined for
the scrap-heap. The onlv effective tribunal
must have behind it an effective army; and
it is probable that wars will be abolished
generations before armies are suppressed.

ful, for A. Neil Lyons knows how to mix
his pathos with his laughter—a thing the
importance of which Edward Dyson who

overlooked. These pictures of London slum
life are done with an art that almost makes
the reader forget the author’s valiant humor.

Most terrible of all is the story of the
return from his 10 years in gaol of the gallant
young man whose fierceness of disposition
had gained for him the name of “The
Ginger-Nut.” His sister expects to find
him more ginger-nutty than ever; and the
man whom she welcomes home is a terrible
figure, with all the vitality drained out of
, i be Pl ess being, gentle, disciplined,
childishly obedient.
“Presently the Ginger-Nut woke to an en-
thusiasm. Some brass-work caught his eye
about the fireguard. The brass-work was
dull, and he rubbed it with the sleeve of his
coat. Then he drank beer and stared at the
fender, after which he repolished the fender
and drank more beer, and stared at his knees
and fell asleep.
“Maria lighted a candle and touched his
shoulder. The Ginger-Nut woke instantly,
with a start, and stood upright, his hands
held tight to his sides, in the attitude of
attention....
“‘He’s a more gentle fellow now,’ said
Maria. . . .‘But, my God !’ she exclaimed, her
drab cheeks warming, ‘what have they done
to Ms eyes ?’ ”
In this bri,ef sketch there is the whole
moral of Galsworthy.’s Justice.

James Stephens, the author of The Char-
womans Daughter, and of those “Hell-and-
Devil” poems recently reprinted on this page,
goes blithely along his lonely road. The
Crock of Gold (Macmillan) is a fantasy of
humor and philosophy dealing with wise men
and Leprecauns and policemen—lrish
policemen are rather a specialty with James
Stephens—and the conflict between the god
Pan and the Irish god, Angus Og, for the
soul of an Irish maid. There is also the crock
of gold, which was stolen from the Lepre-
cauns, and “a Lepr,ecaun without a pot of
gold is like a rose without perfume, a bird
without a wing, or an inside without an out-
side.” Hence all the strange happenings to
the Philosopher and the policeman. The
Wise Man is a delightful old bloke; his
views on washing: “An extraordinary cus-
tom. We are washed both on coming into
the World and on going out of it, and we
take no pleasure from the first washing nor
any profit from the last... .The first person
who washed was possibly a person seeking a
cheap notoriety. Any fool can wash him-
self, but every wise man knows that it is an
unnecessary labor, for nature will quickly
reduce him to a natural and healthy dirti-
ness again. We should seek, therefore, not
how to make ourselves clean, but how to
attain a more unique and splendid dirtiness,
and perhaps the accumulated layers of mat-
ter might, by ordinary geologic compulsion,
become incorporated with the human cuticle
and so render clothing unnecessary”; his
views upon sleep: “As an accomplishment
it is graceful, but as a means of spending a
night it is intolerably ridiculous”; in fact,-
big. views upon everything, from
wisdom to females, are witSlw absnrrf a
fantastic. But when the wise man zL™

«„^? hu r Co ? an Boy 1 ® breaks new groun
in Ihe Lost World (Ilodder and Stoughton
per Dymock s Library), the story of an ex
pedition that set out to prove or disprov
tne assertion of an exploring scientist that
bouth America there was a plateau inhabited
by animals long supposed to have been ex
tinct. The expedition finds the plateau aiic
manages to ascend the precipices that fo
uncountable ages, have shut it off from th
rest of the world. There they meet enoug
extmqt animals and ape-men to satisfy th
most enthusiastic zoologist, and, after many
hardships, triumphantly return to exhibit in
a London lecture-room a living specimen of
Pterodactyl. The adventure is admirably
done,_ the quarrels of the rival professor
showing that Conan Doyle’s hand has no
lost its _ cunning; but what a book H. G
Wells, m his earlier manner, would have
made out of this plateau of huge saurians
and dinosaurs!
The German Crown Prince is apparently
keen to emulate Roosevelt. From my Hunt
iny Day-Book (Hodder and Stoughton, per
Angus and Robertson, 65.), is a gorgeoush
produced work, illustrated by photographs of
the _ thin-legged youth “snapped” in Roose-
veltian attitudes over a varied assortment
of dead meat. The letterpress is naive anc
scrappy, and in the youth’s innocent mine
there is a smug belief in the glory of murdering
animals badgered by beaters into a state
of nerve-worry that renders them practically
inoffensive to a well-armed human. How-
ever, Wilhelm hasn’t had any chance to know
better. This big-and-small-game shooting,
conducted under modern conditions, is a
“sport” the danger of which is infinitesimal
compared with aeronautics. But, of course,
the charm of murdering untamed meat is
that it is a useless game, while the martyrs
of the air usually serve some useful purpose.
“Eddyson”: I think it a decided error to
describe the striking effect of Chas. Ken-
nedy’s The Terrible Meek to a theatrical
trick. It is not a mere theatrical trick; it
is an inspiration and pure art, which mere
trickery can never be. The artist may use
the dawning of day, the coming of light
after darkness, for any effect he pleases,
without outraging the canons of art, and if
he uses the colloquialism of our day and
nation in telling the story of the Crucifixion
in his own way, he is justified by a thousand
precedents. The common soldier of Jerusa-
lem 2000 years ago may have used a dialect,
and the translator of -his emotions is justi-
fied in employing the idiomatic language of
the man in the same class in the nation and
generation to which he (the writer) is ap-
pealing; otherwise it would be impossible
for him to get an identical effect. I am
assuming that the use of the vulgar speech of
to-day, along with the sudden transition to
Calvary, comprises the alleged trick detected
by the Red Reviewer. Had the absurdly
stilted phraseology modern authors usually
put into the mouths of the ancients been em-
ployed by Kennedy, no suggestion of trickery
would have arisen in the mind of the li. R.
Tell your story with your own tongue.
Doubtless Dugald Ferguson, of Tapanui,
M.L., considers himself a poet. His works
include, Bush Life, The King's Friend,
Mates, Sacred Poems, and now Castle Gay
and Other Poems (with portrait) published
by Stone, Dunedin, M.L. In his prologue to
this collection of rimed commonplaces he im-
plies that poesy upon him smiles, and scorn-
fully refuses to forsake his muse. A search
through the book failed to unearth the muse.
It appears from the preface that Castle Gay
and Other Poems is a revised edition of a
work published in 1897 and distributed
through the South Island only. The collec-
tion includes “Verses Addressed to My
Brother on Exchanging Boots,” “On the
Eventful Life of Captain Jackson Barry,”
“On Two Sisters” (composed while engaged
at sod-fencing), “On Tea” and other cheer-
ful topics. It should be distributed through
the South Island only.

Gives New Life to the Invalid
An outstanding feature in “Wincarnis” is its
extraordinary power in re-creating lost vitality
and giving new life and renewed health to
those who, after a long illness, are left in
a pitiable state of wrecked health and
shattered nerves.
Renewed Strength to the Weak
Every winegiassful of “Wincarnis” equips
the system with a definite amount of renewed
health and strength that overcomes weak-
ness and exhaustion, and speedily gives to
the whole body a delicious feeling of physical
fitness that is lasting.
Vigor to Brain Workers
When the delicate mechanism of the brain
becomes disorganised by overwork, worry,
or by the ever-increasing demands of
modern business conditions, “Wincarnis”
has. an immediate effect in stimulating
the activity of the brain and promoting
additional keenness and increased vigor
to the whole mental system, thereby
ensuring the brain-worker against future
breakdown.
A Wealth of Health to Everyone
To everyone whose health is not as it should
be—to those suffering from Anaemia, Sleep-
lessness, Weakness, Brainfag, Lowered
Vitality, Exhaustion, Nerve Troubles, or who
are merely “rundown”—'“Wincarnis” offers a
wealth of renewed health and a progressive
upbuilding; of vitality and vigor that will
make the whole system pulsate with new
life. Ov«er 10,000 doctors recommend
Will you try just one bottle P

‘Sackcloth”: I’m always being told that, of all
the stalwart Laborites i of Australia, miners are the
most stalwart,; so when I had a chance the other
day I went up to Cobar to worship at the shrine of
the true-reds. The Eight-Hour demonstration was
taking place. “They’ll, be more stalwart than ever
at this time,” said I to myself. The “official pro-
gramme” was passed along in due course. Turning
it over I came on a fat advt.: “The Cheapest House
in Cobar. _Ah Tim Pong and Co. Where the Work-
ers Shop.” There are no non-workers in Cobar, and
when I saw the size of that Pong shop I knew the
advt. wasn't entirely a liar. Yet there are plenty of
white shops owned by white men who pay white
assistants white wages. Heaven only knows what
would happen if the mining cos. tore” a leaf out of
their white workers’ book and started to employ
Chinamen at Chinese wages. A strike would be only
one of the things that would happen.
\Ahhatherra”: Shrewd, progressive meh have
speht heart-breaking mohths herdihg the cream pro-
ducers of the western district of Victoria into co-
operative societies. Energetic organising secured the
support of most of the juice providers in those parts.
1 lonts came rapidly, and cream depots were run up
in every dairying centre. Then some of Melbourne’s
big butter firms felt that they must stake every-
tmng on a last throw, so they arrived at a dishon-
orable understanding to ruin the healthy and square-
dealing co-operative concerns. Opposition cream
depots sprang up, and combine touts painted the
cheques that were to eventuate a brilliant Carmifie.
I he fool cockles are rapidly falling in, the big co-
op. concerns are languishing, add I expect to
hear at any moment the loud report of many
co.op. shareholders rushing madly away**from their
own institutions, Cookies are chronically addicted
to panic if there is the slightest suspicion of weak-
ness, and the combine knows the symptoms surpris-
ingly well. After the co-op. concerns have been
rendered helpless, the cocky will begin to find out
that the combine didn’t knock out co-operation for
fun. But it will be too late then; the pigeofi will
be in the pie.

“A. Borig”: The Sydney regulation against littfet-
ing the streets with used tram tickets is undermin-
ing the nervous system of us country people wheh
we go to Sydney, for no mail is so frightened of tttfe
‘Tor’’ as the baekblockcr. We won’t go to Sydney
at all presently; and then how will you get on? 1
don’t know what to do with the cursed fragments.
If I pocket them, they fly out in heaps every time I
feel for 3d. The number I have plainly and squarely
eaten has had such a bad effect on my innards that
I can't continue to do it. “Blarsting” them is of no
use, though we do that very powerfully. Here is a
suggestion or a scheme which I would like you to
take round to the Patent Office, giving me half the
profits. Conversation lollies! The conductor could
have a bag—say 1000 —of these nourishing articles,
each suitably engraved with a moral, religious or
temperance, text. He would hand one to his
passenger with a pair of sterilised tweezers. Even
if thrown away the confectionery would be promptly
pounced upon by the city boys and summarily de-
voured. Probably the religious, temperance or even
licensed victuallers’ bodies would provide the loz-
enges on account of the texts thereon. P.S. —Please
send me £2OOO on account.
The bankrupt municipality of Balranald (N.S.W.)
has been given its discharge. Two years ago the
arrears of interest due on account of the town water
supply were so large that peremptory demands for
payment were made. No money being forthcoming,
the Government put a bailiff in possession. By his
careful management, all arrears have been paid, the
town revenues are in good order, and Balranald
is once more solvent. The courts have now for-
mally handed the township back to the ratepayers
and called the bailiff off. Only those who have come
home and found the bailiff missing from his old
seat by the fireplace can fully enter into the glad
spirit of Balranald.

“K.”: When recently a 100-mile-an-hour hurricane
was picking up the Southern Ocean and hurling it after
the flying steamer Indrapura, some of the Australian-
bound men-immigrants, battened below decks, fell
and slithered towards their bunks, and, with chaos
raging within and fury without, feverishly gathered
together their most prized possessions. The force of
the wind-tortured sea was so terrific that one wave
snatched away a deckhouse used as an isolation hos-
pital. The steamer was running full speed before the
storm, and even then could only just keep ahead of
the towering seas that raced behind. The maddest
lunatic that ever went afloat would not have at-
tempted to leave the big ship in a boat, while if the
steamer went down the treasures would sink just as
far in the owner’s pocket as they would in his
trunk. Why, then, the frenzied raking of them to-
gether? These immigrants couldn’t have told you.
I can’t either. Property-preservation just seems to
be the second law of Nature.
A DOMESTIC EPISODE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My love sat in a sweet eclipse,
Half buried in a chair,
Considering some little slips
Of paper fraught with care.
(But I Was thinking of her lips
And also of her hair,)
The weary weight of household Mils
Occasioned frequent sighs.
She pondered o’er the cash that spills
Itself in wondrous wise.
(But I was feeling little thrills
From looking at her eyes.)
She pencilled figures in a book.
How far a pound should go,
If judged by numbers as they look
When counted in a row!
(But I observed one loosened hook
And that soft skin below.)
The dressmaker had charged so Much
For stitches small and few.
Tim folk with whom we dealt were such
A greedy-minded crew!
(I saw one glint of ribbon touch
Her camisole with blue.)
But as the morning follows night
And chases gloom away,
I saw a change serene and bright
Across her features play.
(Oh, it was good to hear the light,
Quick trill of laughter gay.)
She lifted up a rosy face
No worry could defile,
And laid the bills beside my place
With arch and dimpled smile.
(While such delight my heart could tracf
All bills were well worth while.)
Her little fingers touched my hand,
Her lips were pressed to mine,
One soft arm like a silken band
About me seemed to twine.
(I felt like some glad grains of sand
Tied with a fishing-line.)
Her hair had come a trifle loose
Like sunlit damp that spills
Its gladness for the constant use
Of turning water-mi 115....
But / was thinking how the deuce
To pay those blessed bills.

Ideally Suited for Country Houses, Stores, Hotels & Billiard Saloons.
“Working satisfactorily and giving excellent
results.”
Trawool, 4th July, 1911.
Dear Sirs, —I am pleased to inform you that the
Aerogen Safety Gas Machine purchased from you nearly
12 months ago is working very satisfactorily and giving
excellent results.
I find it very economical to run, and, on account of the
automatic working, entails very little attention.
The light is a most excellent one, and the gas is per-
fectly safe.
I shall be pleased to recommend it to anyone requiring
an up-to-date light.
Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) H. A. McKENZIE.

“For cheapness it surpasses any other light he has
ever used.”
Halifax, Queensland, 17th August, 1911.
Dear Sirs,- —The Aerogen Gas Plant which I purchased
from your firm early in the year has been giving thor-
ough satisfaction, and I am perfectly pleased with it.
1 have found Aerogen a most brilliant light, and, in my
opinion, superior to all others.
The great charm with Aerogen is its cleanliness, there
being no refuse or offensive smell, and for cheapness it
surpasses any other light I have ever used. I shall be
surprised if this light does not take the place of Acety-
lene in the near future.
Wishing your firm lots of success with these
machines. '
Yours faithfully (Sgd.) O. T. LANGLEY.

Ayer's
Hair f
Vigor I
I What does it do? It makes
the hair soft and glossy, pre-
cisely as nature intended. It
cleanses the scalp from dan-
druff, and thus removes one of
the great causes of baldness. It
makes a better circulation in
the scalp, and thus greatly pro-
i motes growth. And it stops the
hair from coming out. But it
never affects the color. Consult
your doctor; follow his advice.
Palling hair is sometimes caused
by impure blood or weak nerves.
Then constitutional treatment with
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is necessary.
This local and constitutional treat-
ment will surely bring prompt results.

Excess fat injures your health, impedes your
movements, and makes you the butt of your
unfeeling normal-weight friends. People who
have been fat, and are now reduced to normal,
think other fat people ridiculous.
Not alone does excess fat injure your health
and endanger your existence, it absolutely de-
stroys your figure and makes you a ludicrous
sight. Why do you stay fat? “FATCURE”
positively removes excess fat, and will restore
your spoiled figure to decent and pleasing; pro-
portions, and is always a sure and lasting; cure
for obesity and corpulency. A few doses im-
proves your breathing wonderfully, and the course
of treatment will cure you.
RESULTS GUARANTEED.
It is the only successful, and, at the same time,
harmless, fat-reducer that has ever been discov-
ered. Its efficacy has been undeniably demon-
strated in thousands of successfully-treated cases.
It is totally and absolutely non-ooisonous, and can
in no wise work any injury to the general health ;
though it often reduces excess weight by as much
as a pound a day.
LET US SEND YOU A FREE SAMPLE OF EITHER “ FATCURE” or “FLESH-FOOD.”
Send 2d. stamp, and say which remedy you want, and we will send free sample, also free'hook,
“OBESITY” to fat folk and “BUST” to thin ones. Be sure to say which sample you want. No matter
where you live we can treat you successfully by post. Confidential. Write or call to-day. [AIBI2

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Waiting.
A chimney pot, and a wire or two, and a
patch of warm, blue sky ;
The rustle faint of a silken dress as a
patient passes by;
A murmur of voices close at hand—the
click of a closing door;
The tragic calm of the waiting room over-
powers my heart once more.
Here in this calm, unlocked retreat —in this
cushioned and curtained cell,
They come and go in their rev’rent Way.
The trill of the muffled bell
Calls up the serious, soft-voiced girl who
moves like some young priestess
To hear their pleadings, usher them in, and
comfort their meek distress.
(A patient hammer a street away is tap-
ping a working song;
I hear the roll of an empty cab that
leisurely rolls along;
Out there in the sun the world drinks joj
with every careless breath;
But in these shadows they sit dry-mouthed
in the sanctuary of death.)
A lovely morning—if one were well! A
day to be free from care!
A traveller’s day for a well-found ship
bound outward, anywhere,
With brave winds blowing, white caps show-
ing, old marks dropping astern;
Not here! —not here in this whisp’ring place
with the eyes that dully yearn!
The solemn boom of the city clock rings out
like a sentence here;
Each great note falls from the awful height
as a warning cold and clear;
The busy folk at its tower’s base scarce heed
—if they hear—its chime ;
But drift along with the stream of Life —
the stream that despises Time.
The white clouds pass and the good sun
shines. (On the roofs I see it
gleam.)
Out of a chasm of black slates waves a
■flaunting feather of steam;
And, muffled by walls and doors, I hear the
hiss of the engine’s breath.
(That patient hammer a street away keeps
tapping its tune of death!)

Note on a Bad Debt.
I met you first upon a day of June,
When Prudence slept (she is an old
offender) ;
Your moods w T ere variable as the moon;
But, ah, your eyes were tender!
At your suggestion, then, I needs must break
Some mere appointment, and was very
glad to.
Said conscience: “Don’t try yet, for good-
ness’ sake,
To kiss her!” But I had to.
You had a mouth, my dear, in those dead
days,
Such as pale Psyche never offered Cupid.
I said : “Your lips delicious I can’t praise
Enough.” The rest was stupid.
Adorable your shoulders were. (Perhaps
You’ll still agree that you had winsome
shoulders,
Now that you waste their grace on other
chaps,
Glib strange beholders.)
Your shoulders, I was saying, were so white
That worshipfully oft I hymned and kissed
them.
You crooned: “Two little dimples on the
right
I somehow think you missed them.”
Your hair was full of vagrom lights that
whirled
And shifted till my brain was one con-
fusion.
“You are the dearest thing in all the world.”
Invariable conclusion.
You had an agile wit that leapt and laughed,
And whipped me to fresh ardors when 1
faltered.
You led me (’twas not always wine I
quaffed),
Your willing slave, fast-haltered.
Now I am old, and you have flung away
To tend a moneyed bounder’s bloated liver;
And yet my heart runs to you every day,
As streams run to the river.,
I plucked a fruit and held it to my mouth ;
But on my tongue were ashes salt and
rotten.
Your beauty for a season tricked my drouth,
And then But you’ve forgotten.
MAORILAND.

How Many Cows?
The teacher down at Cowbail Flat
A lecture gave on Ancient Rome;
The milkers round about him sat;
His knowledge deep they wondered at,
For none of them knew Gibbon’s tome.
The emperors and legions swept
With purple pomp before their eyes:
The widows made by Caesar wept,
And his assassins foully crept
To stab him into Paradise.
The value of the murdered king
The teacher stressed in rev’rent tones ;
“Great Caesar could do anything,
And Shakspeare’s lines his fame would sing
Above the last man’s sun-bleached bones.”
Dead silence reigned within the hall;
Then came a rustle as of silk,
And one who had been held in thrall.
Asked gravely on behalf of all:
“ ’Ow many cows could Seezer milk?”

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them, to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

TRUSTS AND TARIFFS.
Despite the fact that an anti-Socialistic
Attorney-General in an anti-Labor Ministry
demonstrated, some years ago, that there
were upwards of 30 more or less injurious
trusts at work in Australia, and despite the
further notorious fact that the number has
been added to largely since then (brick
trusts, fruit rings and other organisations
by means of which the cost of living has
been raised greatly are comparatively
modern developments), the Tory press con-
tinues to argue that there is nothing to
worry about. Australia has no trusts;
meat and jam, schnapper and oranges and
a thousand other commodities which are
produced on the spot, have got dearer owing
solely to the tariff! And, in any case, if
trusts do come, all that will be necessary
to frustrate them and drag prices down
again, is a reversion to Freetrade. The
S. M. Herald, in assailing the author of the
Referendum questions, in connection with
his Trade and Commerce Clause Amending
Bill (the crux of all effective anti-trust
legislation), put it this way:—
Dr. Woodrow Wilson, who has just been elected Pre-
sident in the United States, was specially emphatic in
his speeches that the tariff had made the trusts and
corporations possible. Through the tariff they could
be controlled, but Mr. Hughes, the Freetrader, has
nothing to say under this head.
It is significant, in the first place, that
Woodrow Wilson, the alleged Freetrader,
lias no intention of prescribing for his suf-
fering country _ any of the economic medi-
cine which he is said to believe in. In the
clearest and firmest language he repudiated,
just before his election, what he called “the
bugaboo of Freetrade.” And if he were so
demented as to attempt by a reversion to
the fiscal system of the local aborigines to
disorganise the vast manufacturing business
which has been built up in the U.S. under
a higlilv Protective tariff, the step could not
conceivably have any bearing on the destruc-
tion of trusts. The whole history of modern
times goes to show that Freetrade, revenue
tariffism, Cobdenism, or whatever it may be
called, is no more injurious to the growth
or maintenance of trusts than it is to the
spread of prickly pear in Queensland or the
increase of rabbits in Victoria.
* * * *
Britain, one of the last remaining cita-
dels of importerdom, is likewise one of the
trust strongholds of the world. It has no
monopolies in such primary commodities as
meat, oil, etc., for obvious reasons. But
whereyer a pool or vend is practicable, it is
to be discerned as hard at work in merrie,
I reetrade-blessed old England as in the
most tariff-blighted country on earth. Thus
the dyeing industries of Bradford and York-
shire came to a trade understanding some
years ago. They now control 90 per cent,
of the dyeing business of the United Iving-
,.? m ’, ancl are al) le to ask what prices they
like for their wares. There are over-whelm-
mgly powerful combinations in the busi-
nesses of thread-manufacturing, calico-
printing, fine cotton-spinning, bleaching and
cotton-manufacturing, also in the cement,
wall paper, white lead and soap trades. The
methods pursued by these concerns in no
wise differ from the methods of pools in
other parts of the world. A tobacco
trust set out, a decade ago, to collar: the
street trade” of Bondon. Shops bearing
the good old English name or style of Sal-
mon and Gluckstein sprang up every-
where. Their garish windows illuminated
the fog like vast Parisian diamonds. Pasted
a prominent position was the legend:
We charge 30 per cent, less than any to-
bacconists in the street.” They did, be-
cause, being a wealthy combine, "they could
afford to—for a time. After a brief, futile
struggle against their outrageously cheap
and glittering enemy, the small tobacconists
invariably caved in, and either started else-
where, in the sure and certain knowledge
that they would be dislodged from their new
positions as soon as the trust considered it
worth while, or took to hod-carrying, or
something of the sort. A cable message
mentioned last week that “an extensive
shipping trust” was in course of formation
m London, embracing the British India,
Cunard, Furness Withy, P. and 0., and
Koyal Mail Packet companies. The Cham-
berlain family made its fortune by getting
a monopoly of the Birmingham screw busi-
ness. Successful vends have for long existed
in the coal and milling industries. There
are actually trusts >vhich control such im-
ported necessaries of life as bacon and but-
ter ; and as this paper has remarked before,
it the U.S. Beef Trust once gets a footing
in Australia —the last remaining meat-pro-
ducing country with full control over its
beef and mutton output—the fiscal defence-
lessness of Great Britain will be of no avail
to prevent its inhabitants being fleeced as
regards their meat bill, on thoroughly Ameri-
can lines.
* * * *
To show the imbecility of the contention
that trusts are the natural corollaries of
tariffs, it is instructive to consider the case
of France. Since 1892, when the schedule
recommended by Meline came into opera-
tion, France has been one of the most
stringently-protected countries on earth.
Government after Government has, as a
matter of course, paid the same earnest at-
tention to the industrial defences of the na-
tion as to its army and navy. Every
conceivable article almost, from live horses
to dead fowls, from tortoises to margarine,
and from bark hats and tom-toms to loco-
motives and umbrella ribs, carries a slashing
duty. If there were anything in the pro-
nouncement ascribed to Woodrow Wilson,
alleged Freetrader and, incidentally, denun-
ciator of Freetrade, one would expect to
see the land of the Gaul absolutely infested
by trusts. In point of fact, it has fewer
than any other country of its size and
wealth. The explanation is to be found in
its comprehensive and far-reaching and,
above all, effective anti-trust legislation, It
is an offence under the French penal code for
persons to combine unfairly to raise prices
to the detriment of the consumer; and the
authorities at the centre of government are
empowered o proceed against those who so
offend, wb* ther the deed is done as close at
hand as Auteuil, or as far awav as Bayonne.
Germany, another highly-protected country,
has rather more than its share of monopolies.
But they do no more robbery than, say, Vic-
toria’s State railway trust. The public is
not hostile to them, and it is no political
party’s aim to exterminate them. This is
because the. central Government supervises
their operations, and possesses the identical
power to put a curb on any depredations on
their part, which the Australian Government
is seeking in the Commonwealth to-day.
* * * *
It thus appears that Britain, which is a
Freetrade- country more or less, and which
enjoys a unified form of government, has
many undesirable monopolies; that France,
the amazingly prosperous, with high Protec-
tion and the brand of Constitution that
Liberalism claims will spell ruin for Aus-
tralia, has hardly any ; that Germany is un-
harassed by such evils; while America, a
Federation with a lofty tariff wall, provides
the world’s horrible example in the matter
of outrageously predatory monopolies, and
the Corpmonwealth, a Federation with a
protective obstruction that a reasonably agile
goat could hop over, bids fair shortly to
emulate the U.S. itself as a trust pleas-
aunce. From this it is obvious that tariffs
have nothing whatever to do with the case.
Certainly, to anyone who approaches this
question with the blinkers of a dead and
discredited fiscal creed removed from his
eyes, it must be apparent that no existing
trust that is worthy the name can be affected
m the remotest degree by lowering duty
schedules. What insanity, for example, to
talk of prejudicing, much less destroying,
the U.fe. Beef Trust, which already practi-
cally controls the meat output of the world,
by admitting Australasian mutton and so on
to America free ! And what possible tariff tin-
kering is going to hurt America’s sugar or oil
monopolies? The problem is, of course, en-
tirely one of legislation, and penal legisla-
tion at that. Britain has full power under
its Constitution (the same glorious Con-
stitution . which local “Liberalism” dreads
may be inflicted on Australia) to dissolve,
utterly and forever, every combine in the
land. It has not yet arisen in its fury and
done the deed, for several reasons. For one
thing, its hands have been full, of late, with
industrial and other urgent troubles, and,
for another, its monopoly menace is a com-
paratively recent and mild development. Yet
already, chiefly by means of amendments
to the Companies Acts, Parliament has begun
to hit at the trusts; and the moment the
House gets really serious on the subject,
there is nothing surer than that-every one of
them will vanish as though it had never
been. America would do the same to-
morrow, with almost hysterical joy. But its
Constitution forbids. With charming in-
fenuousness John Forrest remarked in the
lepresentatives last week :
The trade and commerce power that Australia pos-
sessed had been sufficient for the United States for
over 100 years.
And in the sense in which one might say that
a wooden leg, and a glass eye, and an at-
tack of the mumps had sufficed a man for a
lifetime, he was, broadly speaking, right.
It is not High Protection but the Trade and
Commerce clause in the U.S. Constitution
that has all along been the buckler of the
trusts. By virtue of this clause the Na-
tional Parliament is rendered impotent to
deal- with, any combine, however dishonest
and rapacious, so long as that combine can
find so much as one State accommodating
enough to put up with it. Just as Tas-
mania under our Constitution leaps at the
chance to house Tattersall’s sweeps, so
New Jersey and similar easy-going States
are willing, for a valuable consideration, to
permit the hunted monopolies of America to
register and operate within their borders.
Under Australia’s trade and commerce clause
the Federal Parliament has no power to in-
terfere with “any trading or financial corpor-
ation whose operations do not extend beyond
the confines of one or more States.” That
is to say, the U.S. Beef Trust may get to
work in Queensland (as it has done), and so
long as it is careful not to slop over into N.
S. Wales it may be said to be as safe as any
cathedral. N. S. Wales and S. Australia are
full of local trusts big and small, which are
hoisting the cost of living in the most
audacious fashion. Under our demented trade
and commerce clause, provided they confine
their robbery strictly to N. S. Wales, or
S. Aus./ as the case may be, the National
Parliament has no power to order them to
cease thieving. France possesses this power,
and because it has exercised it, there are not
enough injurious combines from Dunkerque
to Marseilles to cause the most rabid of in-
dustrial alarmists a single spasm. England
possesses it, and the trusts it has are there
simply because the weapon capable of scotch-
ing them has been allowed to rust in the
armory, so to speak. Till America and Aus-
tralia firmly disregard all Tory blither to the
effect that they are not to be trusted with a
power which European countries have held
without damage to themselves for centuries,
they may interfere with the altitude of their
tariff walls till further notice, and nothing
of an unpleasant nature can possibly happen
to the trusts —unless, indeed, some of them
have the ill-luck to burst from over-consump-
tion of the public’s hard-earned savings.
LOOKING AT THE FACTS.
Dr. Arthur, M.L.A., has been issuing a
solemn warning to the people of Australia
on the question of defence. In measured
accents, weighty with solemn admonition,
he urged them to “put aside this ostrich
policy and look facts in the face.” Then,
when he had given the people time to be
duly impressed with the gravity of the situa-
tion, he went on to explain that our folly lay
in thinking that we could protect ourselves
by having a few ships and drilling a few
lads, and that if we were really awake and
alive to the “hideous fate” to which we were
possibly devoting our children’s children, we
would drop the whole business and copy
Maoriland in presenting a Dreadnought or
something to the British Government. In
point of fact, Dr. Arthur’s solemn warn-
ing with regard to the future amounts to
advising the Commonwealth to undo the
little that has been done, and sit down with
empty hands and a vacant smile, trusting
that someone else may do for us the things
that we ought to have done for ourselves.
No one who in any real sense realises the
gravity of Australia’s position can possibly
pretend to be satisfied with our preparations
for defence. Sloth, neglect and failure to
grasp the situation are written large over
the whole shabby business. We cannot feel
pleased that our citizen army consists of
children and young lads, that our direct
trans-continental railway to the sphere of
probable invasion has not even advanced to
the point of being a dotted line upon the
official map, that the gauges of our existing
railways have not been brought to a uni-
form standard, or that there has been tedious
delay over the construction of tire first ships
of our infant fleet. All these things spell
danger, and the mildly enthusiastic utter-
ances of the bunglers who have done their
best to muddle the work are in no way re-
assuring. Australia is not ready for an
emergency, and is not getting ready at a
satisfactory speed. This paper is in agree-
ment with Dr. Arthur to the point that if
our defence is to be worth anything we must
“put aside this ostrich, policy and look facts
in the face.”
* * * *
But what are the facts? Dr. Arthur
would have us retrace our steps and rely,
as in th.e past, upon the protection of Bri-
tain. This may be looking facts in the face,
but it sounds a great deal more like pushing
, our face deeper into the sand. For a
great many years Britain has had some sort
of fleet in Australasian waters. Within
three years the insignificant handful of ships
which the Commonwealth will possess will
be a stronger fighting force than any that
Britain ever offered for our protection. The
young lads who are being drilled nightlv
may deserve all the strictures' that Dr.
Arthur passes upon them, and be worthy
ot all the superior laughter which his re-
marks called forth ; but the plain fact stands
that in all her long history, England was
only on one occasion able to put a larger
force into the field than will be represented
in three years time by the grown soldiers of
the Commonwealth who, as boys, are now
receiving their training. On the face of it
miserably inadequate as our defence system
is, and slipshod and inefficient as has been
the conduct of affairs by those who are
charged with the duty of preparing for any
chance or emergency which the times may
bring forth, Australia seems very much bet-
ter able to take care of herself than her
aged parent in Europe is able to look after
her.
Reliance upon British protection was a
moderately satisfactory business up to 20
years ago. Then the nations of Asia were
asleep, and the navies of Europe were com-
pletely outmatched by that of Britain. No
Power could very well send a force to Aus-
tralian shores more rapidly than a stronger
intercepting force could be sent from Ports-
mouth or Gibraltar. The antiquity of the
ironmongery dumped upon the Australian
station did not matter, for it was at least
as good as any other ironmongery which
another nation could afford to send a like
distance from its home base. While Spain was
protecting the Philippines with wooden arks
somewhat younger than the ships of the
Spanish Armada, the old iron craft sent out
to carry scions of the British aristocracy to
the Melbourne Cup looked respectable
enough, and would doubtless have given a
quite satisfactory account of themselves
against Noah’s Dreadnought, or any ship
of ancient Phoenicia, or war-junk of China
which might have happened round. To-day
everything has changed—changed with a.
rapidity and completeness that may well
make the most careless uneasy for to-mor-
row and the day after. England has her
work cut out to defend her own shores, and
only by taking risks —which, presumably,
Dr. Arthur doesn’t want her to do—can
she spare an efficient fighting force, even of
the smallest kind, for distant foreign ser-
vice. Other navies have grown great and
powerful. A new Power of vast military
and naval strength has sprung into being in
Eastern Asia, and a second of infinitely
mightier proportions appears to be rising.
The dangers which threatened Australia in
the years gone by were unsubstantial
shadows, though the vivid imagination of
the people exaggerated them to such an ex-
tent that something akin to panic was more
than once felt. The dangers which threaten
Australia to-day are real and tangible, and
not to be lightly set aside by mere jargon of
words. Before Britain could send a ship to
our assistance, or land a man for the de-
fence of our shores, our cities might be
heaps of ashes and our hope of a White
Australia counted among the dreams of
nations which were dissipated in cannon
smoke. These are the facts, and we agree
with Dr. Arthur that it is well to look
facts in the face.
* * * *
Our defence system is something. It is
not much, but it at least marks a beginning
along the only lines which give a sporting
chance of success. Behind the system,
however, there are those who, unless they
are to be condemned as wilfully negligent
and wittingly untrue to their trust, must
be regarded as troubled with the kind' of
perverted outlook which afflicts Dr. Arthur.
The idea of reliance on Britain is strongly
implanted. The blithersome boasts of jingo-
ism a generation ago have subconsciously
become part of the make-up of some who
should have the widest national grasp of
the situation. Somehow, in a vague kind of
way, the power of Britain is supposed to
work like wireless telegraphy or the com-
munications of the occult, and everything
is expected to go right in spite of the ugly
appearances of things. It is a dangerous
hope to cling to. Very probably in a modern
war Britain would give as good an account
of herself as in the past. It is set to her
credit in history that, after nearly two de-
cades of muddle and expenditure of blood
and treasure, she did, with the assistance
of most of the other countries of Europe,
down the first Napoleon. Possibly in a
similar period of modern fighting she might
do the same kind of thing again, and at the
end of the disturbance come in all lier might
and glory to aid Australia. But let us, as
we are renuested to do, look the facts in
the face.. In 20 years you Can dig a lot of
graves ; in 20 years time the memory of a
people may be all but wiped out from the
soil that bore it; in 20 years time Dr.
Arthur and the rest of ns might have pre-
cious little interest in a British re-conquest
of a continent that we were too idle or
fatuous to try to _ defend. Also, there
mightn’t be any British re-conquest to be
interested in.

BULLETIN NEWSPAPER CO., LTD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
How “Piety” Fosters Vice and Disease.
About a year ago the Queensland Govern-
ment, hounded on by the misguided voice of
militant Wowserdom, passed the amended
Health Act, which suspended the operations
of the C. D. Act. A few days ago the South
Brisbane Council’s chief inspector furnished
the following report on the result of the new
legislation:—•
Since the suspension of the C. D. Act it is well-
nigh impossible to secure sufficient evidence upon
which to base a charge. The inspectors have made
several attempts to secure this evidence, but the most
elaborate plans must fail upon technicalities. When
the C. D. Act was in operation it was sufficient to
prove that the women were registered, and that they
were found on premises with men. Now it is neces-
sary to prove that these women are of ill-fame be-
fore a conviction can be secured. As chief inspector
of this city I cannot make too definite a statement
as to the evil effect of the suspension of the C. D. Act.
From observations made by the inspectors of this
department I can say that the practice complained of
is spreading in all directions. Before the suspension
of the C. D. Act, houses of ill-fame were confined to
a certain quarter ; now the practice is carried on in
all parts of the city.
The unpleasant and dangerous position of
Brisbane affords a further illustration of the
damage that is mostly done when theorists
and visionaries, and sanctimonious ones at
that, get control of affairs. The opponents
of Bananaland’s C. D. Act bear a sort of
family resemblance to the Peace cranks who
oppose universal or any other sort of De-
fence. The attitude of both varieties of con-
scientious objector is ludicrously illogical.
That is to say, the Peace enthusiasts expect
to be safeguarded from the foreign invader
without the trouble and expense of drilling
and arming, while the holy citizens who
battle against any attempt whatever to “re-
gulate vice” are accustomed to raise Sheol
when vice is observed peregrinating the city
in an unregulated condition. Both classes as-
pire after the impossible, or, in the jargon of
the turf, they want to “have it both ways.”
The insanity of the anti-defence party can
only be demonstrated conclusively when,
their doctrines having prevailed, a raven-
ing Asiatic or other alien spoliator arrives
and starts bursting up the pacificists’ homes
and removing their women folk. But the
awful folly of the pious imbeciles who oppose
the mitigation of the evil effects of prostitu-
tion is apparent almost immediately they
succeed in their efforts. No one claims, now-
adays, that C. D. Acts represent the very
latest and best steps that can be taken in
their line. In countries like Norway and
Sweden, where the State attends to the
health of the people with meticulous care,
such legislation is regarded as out of date.
Australia is not yet, however, educated up
to the sanitary standard of these progressive
little lands. But that is no reason why it
should adhere to the sanitary standards of
the untutored aborigines. A properly ad-
ministered C. D. Act reduces by half the lia-
bility of the State to contract diseases of a
particularly horrible and dangerous sort.
It localises prostitution, and in so doing
minimises it. There are at least three women
who will pursue the Magdalen calling under
the rose, so to speak, for one who is so har-
dened as to take to it beneath the disap-
proving and tireless eye of officialdom. Social
reformers have been urging on London for
years past the easily credible fact that force
of example does an appalling lot to swell the
ranks of the fallen sisterhood. As in the
case of lysol-drinking, advertisement pro-
duces the recruit with painful regularity.
In the circumstances, if C, D. Acts did no
more than keep the members of the world’s
oldest profession out of the public eye, they
would be justified to a certain extent. If the
Wowser who uses the sectarian vote, which
he controls, to kill C. D. Acts and prevent the
compulsory notification of venereal com-
plaints, could but realise all the ruined lives,
the diseased bodies, and the children made
miserable from birth that are the direct out-
come of his efforts, he would probably be a
horror-stricken and remorseful Wowser in-
deed. But in the nature of things he hardly
ever can, and so he continues to toil furi-
ously at the insane business of causing the
world sorrow and anguish in the name of
righteousness.

Fall In, Maoriland!
The proposed co-operation between Aus-
tralia and Maoriland in the matter of de-
fence has a sane and wholesome look about
it. The Maoriland problem differs in some
respects from that of the Commonwealth,
owing to the configuration of the country
and the better distribution of population.
The Shaky Islands have no vast unpeopled
regions to defend, no huge line of coast
within a few days’ sail of Asia to protect,
and no serious difficulties of transit and
supply to contend with. Their broken moun-
tain ranges are the natural ramparts which
protect the fertile regions, and the fact that
the towns and cities are small and scattered
must tell against the success of any invader.
Auckland might be seized by an invading
force, or Dunedin shelled from beyond the
Ocean Beach, or Invercargill caught in the
midst of its bitter thirst and laid under con-
tribution, without the country as a whole
being very much nearer subjugation than
before the unpleasantness began. Also, the
cost to the enemy of seizing and holding any
particular point would probably be greater
than any immediate gain in spoils or satis-
faction, and the feeding of any considerable
army during a long campaign would be a
serious business. On the other hand,
should the command of the seas pass to a
powerful enemy, Maoriland’s position would
be without a parallel in history. Cut off
entirely from all communication with the
world, imprisoned within its own narrow
bounds, fuming at restraints, and yet unable
to effect liberation, it might develop into a
nation of marvellous strength and resource-
fulness, or it might sink into utter savagery.
In any case, the business would be pretty
unpleasant for the Maorilander, and he may
well consider whether a few ships owned
and manned by his own people and acting
in conjunction with the Commonwealth
navy would not be well worth their cost as
an insurance against such a contingency.
The presentation of a Dreadnought to Bri-
tain by lou Ward was engineered in such
a way that the public of the Shaky Islands
never had a real chance of saying whether
they wanted things done in that way or
not; and now that the British Government
and tbe Conservative press of the Cold
Country, as represented by the London
Times, have made it quite clear that they
regard with complete satisfaction the growth
of Overseas navies, there seems no good
reason why Maoriland shouldn’t throw in
its lot with Australia and go the whole hog
in the matter of a local fleet. If Austral-
asia can combine to keep the seas open, the
citizen armies will get into shape some time.
After all, it is the British way, and that
should appeal even to the flag-flapping
patriots who think that J. Bull sums up
in his own person all wisdom, truth and
knowledge.
The Addled Eggs of the McGowen
Government.
Dear Bulletin, —When the next Labor
Conference meets I shall produce a few
searching inquiries as to which N.S.W. Min-
isters should be the targets for the aged and
infirm fowl-fruit that somebody deserves for
the mad borrowing indulged in since they
took office. Premier McGowen’s first
speech of any consequence on the financial
question was made in conjunction with the
1911 Budget. A reformed system of book-
keeping was announced which took away
the breath of Wade’s party, with the im-
portant exception of David Fell, one of
the few members who understand finance.
The State accounts were to be put on a plain
business footing, so simple that even the
Women’s Liberal League would be able to
understand them. At that time Minister
Carmichael was in the Treasury with
McGowen (in fact, he was, to all intents
and purposes, the Treasurer!, and it is
significant that since he left there the fore-
shadowed reforms have never been heard of.
Soon after the Budget of 1911 was pre-
sented, Donald Macdonell died, and the
Cabinet became dislocated. In the subse-
quent shuffle the late Dacey was made
Treasurer; then Carmichael temporarily
retired from the Ministry; and, later on,
when another reallotment of portfolios was
made, Carmichael' was put in charge of the
Education Department, and Cann became
the guardian of Ma’s purse. It is well-
known that Holman and Griffith, any-
how, are disciples of OweSullivanism, and
what I want to know is: Were the apostles
of that doctrine the cause of Carmichael
and. his finance being pigeon-holed? Three
schemes of reform were introduced to the
Assembly at the close of lull. The first
embodied the principle of presenting the ac-
counts so that the receipts and expenditure
of what may be called the domestic side of
government would be plain and aboveboard
The corporate bodies, *such as the Railway
Commissioners, the Sydney Harbor Trust
and the Water and Sewerage Board, were to
be treated as separate business concerns,
each showing its receipts and expenditure.
Thus, it would be impossible for a Treas-
urer to fake his Financial Statement by a
process of transfers; and it would be equally
impossible for bogus adverse criticism to be
levelled at the Government for expenditures,
or worse, for which it was not accountable.
Anyhow, if the bogus gun was levelled, the
charge would merely blow the whiskers off
the operator. The second measure proposed
to establish a sinking fund whereby the
State’s debt would be redeemed in 66 years,
and every future loan would be scrupu-
lously wiped off the books of Israel with-
in a similar period from date of issue. The
Bill worked a stormy passage through the
Assembly, and was then scuttled. That Bill
went farther in some respects than the sink-
ing fund scheme on the Labor party’s plat-
form (one per cent, on all loans) in that it
was retrospective. According to Treasury
officials, the proposed charges on loans and
against the corporate bodies, plus payments
from revenue by the Government on ac-
count of non-reproductive works and build-
ings, would assuredly have cleared the capi-
tal debt in 66 years. A third link in the re-
form chain was a Bill to authorise or compel
the Harbor Trust and Sewerage Board to
provide funds for future renewals, in-
stead of, as now, paying surpluses
into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Lastly, it was proposed to amend the
law so that the whole, instead of two-
thirds as per present arrangement, of the
net receipts from the sale of Crown lands
was to be paid into the Public Works Fund;
net profits from the railways were to be
similarly treated, and the entire fund was,
as far as possible, to be used as a relief to
loan expenditure. The proposed measures
were smothered, and the borrowing party
in the Government went on a wild jag at
Cohen’s. Somewhere about there Car-
michael, as well as what appeared
to be a genuine attempt to reorga-
nise the State finances and make them
look less like the Sunday morning
reckoning-up of 14 Saturday night
beer-chewers, faded permanently from the
scene. Wherefore I reach for my mega-
phone and ask in a loud voice: Did Car-
michael fall or was he pushed? And, in
any case, when does he propose to come to
light again?—Yours, etc., Secretary of
the Industrial Union of Suffering
Citizens.

The Brown Mind and the White.
“George Street,” on a weighty matter: —
A. .Tames, M.L.A. for Goulburn, has just returned
to Sydney from a holiday trip to Ceylon. He comes
with word that in the nigger-infested region of his
sojourn—where, according to as devout an authority
as Bishop Heber, “only man is vile”—the people
have been shocked to their last depreciated rupee by
the “terrible disloyalty” of the people of N. S. Wales
in “evicting” their Governor-General from a house
in Maequarie-street. The feeling of resentment is
said to have been wonderfully pronounced, and the
general opinion was expressed that the State wanted
to “cut the painter.” All of which notions and sen-
timents are exactly what might have been expected
in Ceylon.
Asia has a brown mind, and the white man under
Asiatic influence has his vision tinted to match his
surroundings. England exploited India to great
profit, but did it at enormous cost; for side by side
with the wealth which poured from that land into
public and private coffers in the Cold Country came
a set of ideas, ancient, reactionary, and weighty
with the massed grovel of 5000 years. The white
man, returning from his Indian post, brought with
him a liver, an inability to see European problems
with a white man’s eyes, and a vast faith in the
shams, shows, observances and meaningless forms
and names before which Asia was wont to fall down
and worship. It is this, above all else, that has made
India such a costly possession to Britain. Gradually
the spirit of the black-and-tan has asserted itself.
Flag flapping, blatant talk of Imperialism, reverence
for the things that matter least and contempt for the
great forces that matter most, have been more and
more in evidence wherever the Anglo-Indian has
pitched his evening camp to cool off and enjoy his
pension.
As a plain fact, N.S.W. shows neither loyalty nor
disloyalty in the matter over which some iocai rag-
importers and others are trying vainly to stir up
trouble. The whole question as to whether the
Governor-General has a house in Maequarie-street or
not is of no more vital importance to the community
than the color of Bill Smith’s whiskers or the cut
of his working pants. Whatever attachment Aus-
tralia has to Britain is dependent upon deeper and
more fundamental concerns than the presence at a
few social functions and public formalities of a
person appointed by the King; and people who
imagine that the recent events in Sydney can have
any possible connection with a desire to “cut the
painter,” must have a very poor conception of the
thing they call loyalty. Yet, just such a conception
of loyalty obtains from end to end of Asia, and the
brown mind has so forced itself upon the white in-
telligence that some people even here actually per-
suade themselves that the bond of empire may be a
particular gate-post, or door-mat, or special unre-
stricted view of Sydney Harbor. White Australia,
however, need not worry to any extent about the
opinion of Asia. Whether the Governor-General lives
m Sydney at all, or whether he restricts himself to
a bark humpy in the dry suburbs of Kangaroosalem,
does not matter the toss of one bad penny in our
relationship to Britain, to the white man’s race, or
to the big white man’s work that lies before us in
this continent.

It is time the N. S. Wales backblocks meet-
ings applauding or cursing, as the case may
be, what is known as. “the eviction” were
dropped. Any meaning these gatherings
might have had’ .one way or the other has
vanished. The question has developed into
a sordid party row, with the customary ad-
juncts of lying, slander and false logic. The
“Liberals,” because they oppose the “evic-
tion,” claim to be the only persons who
honor the King and his local representa-
tive ; the “evictionists” are represented as
disloyalists and pro-Boers. Yet it is only
a year or so back that prominent “Liberals'”
in N. S. Wales and Victoria were doing their
utmost to cast mud at the then King’s re-
presentative. They did far worse than take
away from him a place of temporary resi-
dence.: they tried hard to deprive him of his
character. And the sole justification for
their dastardly efforts were the facts that
the maligned vice-regality had supported the
idea of a local 'navy (“a tinpot fleet”) and
universal service (“conscription”), and had
assailed the practice of child slavery on
dairy farms. A few weeks ago a Bathurst
(N.SW.) Town Hall audience declared in
favor of the “eviction.” Last week another
audience declared the other way. Where-
upon the Sydney Telegraph came out with
the following balderdash :
“RIGHT WITH THE NATION.”
THE EVICTION QUESTION.
BATHURST ASSERTS HER LOYALTY.
All Bathurst’s latest achievement signifies is
that there have now been two party
votes on the question in the wilting old
city; and neither of them has any more re-
lation to loyalty than the vote of an M.L.A.
on the late Gas Bill.
“Milmeridien” : If ever a great country
was in the course of having its way greased
to Perdition it is the Northern Territory.
The Administration is ineffable. The out-
standing performances under the great
Dominion Administrator —“the strong man
of great executive ability, of organising capa-
city and strong determination of character”
—have been the installation of an electric
service for Government House (the only
electric service in the Territory; the railway
shunting is being done by the light of a
guard’s lamp) ; a new tennis court for Gov-
ernment House ; the diversion of the water
supply to Government House from the police
station and public buildings, so that the
police were about to send their horses away
for water when the rain saved them) ; and
various other trifles, mostly for the conveni-
ence and comfort of Government House. A
car was bought, ostensibly to allow the Ad-
ministrator to make quick long journeys, but
the quick journeys are mostly taken about
Darwin. (The “fast” motor trip to Boroo-
loola was, of course, plain foolishness, as the
car had to be hauled long distances through
stiff places by horses and tribes of niggers,
who must have thought the white man more
lunatic than usual.) Government House has
been re-decorated and refurnished at Govern-
ment expense, and unnecessarily. The bulk
of the alleged “reforms” have ended in vain
attempts at stupid alteration for mere alter-
ation’s sake. Government workmen were
required to work half an hour earlier, and
after a strike had been provoked the change
was dropped in order to square the trouble.
After that, children were forced into school
at 8 a.m. —a “reform” which looks well on
paper, but in practice has been merely in-
convenient. The Commonwealth’s handling
of the whole business of the Territory leads
one to believe that Kink O’Malley is boss-
ing the Infernal Department as well as the
Department for Home Affairs.
“Fitzjohn,” concerning Sydney’s Univer-
sity and Carmichael’s bill to reform it: —
I think “Fitz william” (B. 28/11/T2) and I could
in time come to a fair agreement on the matter of Uni-
versity reform, but in the meanwhile I’d like to set
him right on another point or two. He quoted 1400
undergraduates as being at the Sydney University. I
can’t give him the figures for 1912, but in 1911
(which I suppose is the year in “Fitzbill’s” mind),
there were only 1387 students all told, and of these
only 1060 were undergraduates. (No Christian
should be permitted to add 32 per cent, to his
figures.) “William,” in a gibe at Uncle Sam’s under-
grad. who gets work in between Uni. terms, com-
plains that the Australian undergrad, couldn’t pos-
sibly earn enough in 13 weeks’ vacation to keep him
throughout the year. Who said anything about 13
weeks, anyhow ? There are three University terms
of 10 weeks each, and even if the student did no
more than put in two for each of even-
ings a week teaching in a continuation
school (for which he would be paid 305.), he’d be on
the road to solving his problem. But I was not
particularly dealing with the poverty-stricken stu-
dent. There are thousands of bright young Austra-
lians who are kept out of the University because their
parents cannot pay the fees, and for no other reason.
And if Minister Carmichael can remove that diffi-
culty for 200 of them per year, this budding nation
will be the gainer. Later on, as I happen to know,
the Minister will mature a hoped-for scheme for
money grants in certain cases. Let “Fitzwilliam”
consider fairly and squarely these significant figures.
In 1908 285 students matriculated, and 258 of them
entered the University. In 1909 the matriculants
dropped to 262 and the entrants to 235. In 1910
there was a still further fall; 259 students matricu-
lated and 207 entered the University. Last year
the number of students who qualified to enter the
University fell to 192. (As 207 entered, it seems
that 15 of those who had previously qualified subse-
quently decided to make use of the qualification.)
That is, the number of matriculants has dropped from
285 in 1908 to 192 in 1911. The opening of the
Queensland University accounted for about 20 out of
the number, but isn’t it evident that Sydney Uni :
versitv wants galvanising or electrocuting or some-
thing? Now, look at the other side. In 1908 there
were 969 State secondary students at high-schools.
In 1909 there were 1035, and in 1910 1168. When
fees were abolished in 1911 the number rose to 2293,
and this year the number has gone up to 3316.
While the University candidates have dropped steadily
there has been a tremendous increase in the number
of secondary students, due, I claim, to the abolition
of hipk-school fees. I reckon it isn’t, too much to
expect that, with the abolition of University fees,
there will be a corresponding increase in the number
of University students.

Greedy Melbourne these days makes heroic
efforts to swallow all the sea-borne trade of
the State ; but every now and then there is
a rush of ships, the docks, piers and river
berths fill, and several latest arrivals have
to swing at remote bay anchorages till some
stout tank unties and shoehorns itself out of
the congestion. Last week, two big steamers
had to pull up within binocular view of their
berths and raging consignees, the limited
blind-alley being full to bursting point. Some
day a large ship will sink at the entrance to
the Yarra, or the convenient oil-stores will
start blazing and carpet the muddy lane with
fire. Then Melbourne will look on helplessly
and request Heaven to inform it why all the
sea-eggs were allowed to be put into the one
inadeauate basket. It may take a sizeable
calamity to bring this about: but Melbourne
has gone to a M of trouble to make sizeable
calamities possible.
The Hoary Precedent.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In a speech opposing the proposed amendments to
the Federal Constitution, Glynn, M.11.R., went back
to Pericles in search of precedents.— Political item.
Mr. Pericles, M.P.,
In four-sixty-nine 8.C.,
Outed Cimon at a general election ;
Premier Cimon, thuswise ex-ed,
Was quite naturally vexed,
And he made an angry speech in this connec-
tion ;
He remarked, in peroration, as he grabbed
his coat and hat,
“You’re a Socialist, you rotter! You’d no
precedent for that!”
Mr. Pericles is dead—
Thoroughly, I’ve heard it said —
And his words and acts may now be safely
quoted
By our statesmen eminent,
Who on mouldy precedent
(If it’s old enough and dead enough) have
doted.
For precedent, I’d have you note, is most
peculiar stuff:
It’s absolutely useless if it isn’t dead enough.
In my youth I ever held
Grave respect for all the eld,
And I found in history a strong attraction.
So, whene’er a scheme I planned,
Eagerly the tomes I scanned
That I might find precedent for ev’ry action.
Yet, despite my zealous labor, and the piles
of books I read,
In the things that truly mattered I seemed
not to forge ahead.
As I nursed my bulging brow,
Said I, “This is wrong somehow.
Precedent, as we all know, is something
holy—
Something we should not neglect
To regard with great respect,
And I feel I’m safe in following it solely.
But had we done it from the start —I grasp,
at least, this much —
We would still be munching apples that we
didn’t oughter touch.
“Well, this problem is immense!”
In my inexperience
I reflected. “How have we progressed, I
wonder ?”
Then the obvious reply
Hit me squarely in the eye:
It is by ignoring precedent, by thunder!
’Tis men who fix the precedents that lead the
nations on.
And not the folk who pin their faith to
leaders dead and gone.
Mr. Pericles, M.P.,
You’re the sort of man for me
(Though I understand you were a Dago
/. alien) ;
’Spite your moral character,
O’er the Styx I greet you, sir,'
You’re the sort we need to-day in things
Australian.
For we’re moved to ask the question of our
statesmen now and then:
“Does this job of fixing precedents belong to
ancient men?”
Mr. Pericles, deceased,
’Spite his deadness, has increased
My respect for all the world’s originators.
If we must have precedents,
My ideal he represents,
For I’m done with copyists and imitators.
And, after- this, my reference is Pericles,
M.P.,
He acted without precedent; that’s prece-
dent for me.

WHERE
EVERYBODY
GOES
With a view to saving the main roads of
N.S.W. from utter disappearance, the Gov-
ernment put £250,000 on the Estimates for
their renovation and repair. Hitherto the
upkeep of the main roads had been left to
the shires and the municipalities, the former
of which received enormous subsidies from
the Government, while the latter received
nothing. The shires have, in most cases
deliberately, misappropriated the money,
neglected the main roads, and spent the
money on local roads, thereby saving them-
selves the necessity of levying taxation on
themselves. The thing became such a scan-
dal that the Government was forced to in-
tervene. The Works Minister introduced a
Bill to create a Supervisory Board which
would decide what should be done to main
roads requiring repairs, allocate the money,
and see that the shires concerned carried
out the work properly. But the mem-
bers who depend on country votes
took up a hostile attitude, and as
the Bill was not made a party mea-
sure, some Laborites voted against it, and
it was thrown out by one vote on the second
reading. Now the men who upset the Bill
find they have upset themselves as well.
Griffith, having got the money passed for
the renovation of the main roads, announces
his intention of devoting it to that purpose,
although there will be no Board to super-
vise the expenditure. It will, therefore, be
spent, presumably, through the Works De-
partment, and the shires will lose the hand-
ling of it altogether—which was not what
the Opposition intended. With the decreased
subsidy many of the shires will have to im-
pose heavier taxation —a loathsome thing to
them. On the other hand, the struggling
municipalities stand to get some measure of
the justice which has hitherto oeen denied
them.

“Locust” : I would like to note down a few
things for the comfort of the Peace Society.
They arise out of the recent transactions in
the Turk.-Bulg. war :
1. The Turk has been strictly acting up to Peace
Society ideals for some years; he has been let-
ting his defences go to pot, his powder get wet,
his army run to seed, and his fortifications, stores
and munitions of war reach almost the Peace Society
standard.
2. The Turk, thus trusting to luck, has been set
upon by the Balkan States, which have (contrary
to the rules provided in that behalf by the Peace
Society) been sharpening their knives, buying can-
non, getting the best instruction, spying and map-
ping the prospective field of war, and generally pre-
paring to fight, while the Turkish nation' was
graduating into a nation-wide Peace Society.
3. Thus suddenly and brutally set upon, in defiance
of Peace Society principles, a state of war ensues,
and the Peace Society may note the humane rules
which have been introduced while the war is going
on. Here are some of them:—
(a) Villages are only burnt when necessary. (The
enemy is the ,fudge of the necessity.)
(b) When the enemy is beaten and flying, it is
permissible to throw shrapnel among them to give
celerity in their retreat.
(c) The streams are only poisoned when dead
bodies fall into them in numbers, and everyone is too
busy pursuing or being pursued to fish them out and
bury them.
(d) The Peace Society has no jurisdiction over
cholera, enteric and gangrene, these refusing to be
bound by the rules of war, and decimating not only
armies, but innocent bystanders.
(e) Children and women are quite safe theoreti-
cally, but there is no rule of the Peace Society to
prevent them dying from starvation or exposure, or
being accidentally shot when villages are (with the
greatest forbearance, and only when absolutely neces-
sary) destroyed by fire and shell.
(/) It is only permissible to drive artillery and
heavy-wheeled vehicles over the dead, wounded and
dving during a retreat when a sauve qui pent has
been sounded by Panic—a good old reliable goddess
who has no faith in Peace Societies.
And last, but not least: —
4. When the war is over, the victor is not per-
mitted to take more than several provinces of the
vanquished’s territory, nor to demand a greater in-
demnity than the latter can pay without going into
I ankruptcy.
The Office Adjutant sums up the posi-
tion :—-
The Balkan war, at time of writing, looks like
fizzling out, and there are signs of dissension among
the allies. Bulgaria, having fought the main Turkish
army, and thus borne the brunt of the struggle,
demands the lion’s share of the spoils, with the
jackal’s for Servia, Greece and Montenegro. All
through they have been poor allies. When the Greek
army was nearing Salonika, the Bulgarians, instead
of following the broken Turks right into Constanti-
nople, detached an army corps to try to anticipate
the Greek occupation of Salonika. This gave the
Unspeakable breathing time, and he ran a line of
forts along the Chatalja' front and brought up
80,000 fresh Asiatic troops, renlenished the larder,
and waited grimly for the attack, drilling fresh re-
serves all the time. He also set to work to.construct
a network of fortified positions behind the lines of
Chatalja, and generally made himself impregnable—
unless he has utterly forgotten how to fight. The
Asiatic hive is still swarming, while Bulgaria is
empty—-so empty that the boys who are not due for
military service till 1914 are under 1 arms in Rou-
melia doing garrison duty. Blocked by Austria
from the Adriatic, Servia desires to come down
through Novi 'Bazar (Old Servia) and Macedonia
right to Salonika. Greece wants to restore the old
Byzantine Empire, and come up, if possible, to Stam-
boul. And Bulgaria hankers after a port on the
Aegean Sea, with a distinct preference for Salonika.
Meanwhile, and all the time, the Turk is drilling
and digging for his very life. It is more than pos-
sible that peace with Turkey, restricted to the sea-
board of Marmora, will be followed by a scrap
between Bulgaria and Servia, with Greece hovering
around ready to pick up unconsidered trifles.

The most curious species in dramatic
zoology is the stage child. It is always a
girl in boy’s clothes, wears its hair long,
and is clothed in velvet and ribbons. Its
face is always clean and its lingers never
grubby. It has no marbles or butter-scotch
r s ’ an( l hank y is always neatly
folded and nicely ironed. It does nothing
violent, it plays gentle games in a lady-like
way, and has never been known to make
mud pies. It speaks v-e-r-y clearly and
v-e-r-y slowly, and it seems to revel in being
kissed. It usually dies lingeringly in a blue
atmosphere; but occasionally it is merely
stolen, probably for its velvet knickerbockers.
And its name is always Bertie. This bio-
logmal analysis is promoted by the fact that
’ Meg, the Castaway,” revived at Sydney Cri-
terion on Saturday, is a stage-kid play. The
little horror, admirably played in the tradi-
tional manner by Pauline Miller, is stolen
by a dog-fancier with a grievance, and put
to sell watercresses in London. Business in
in s^age watercress profession is always
dull. Meg, who had rescued Bertie from the
dog, searches London, and ultimately finds
'.by Quite clean kid. She is assisted in the
job by Sam Sloper, a young man who dis-
guises_ himself as the proprietor of a coffee-
stall joint. Meg is imprisoned for the theft
she never committed, but her character is
cleared at 10.22 p.m., and Sam Sloper, over-
looking certain deficiencies in her speech and
manners, decides to risk matrimony with
her. The kidodrama depends less than usual
on sensation, and more on comedy and
pathos, of the well-known waif brand: “I
never knoo wot kindness vims till now—and
it breaks me ’eart.” The comedy scenes be-
tween Mr. H. R. Roberts, as Sam the coffee-
stall hero, and Miss Maggie Moore, the
starving waif, were mellow and fruity, and
the pathos was distributed through the play
in thick and satisfying junks. The come-
dians were well supported, both by the com-
pany and,, the audience. Meg will be cast
away till to-morrow night, after which Mrs.
McSweeney will finish out the season.
THE- SYDNEY PHIL-
HARMONIC SOCIETY.
“SAMSON AND DELILAH."
THE C ARICATURIST(without a programme, to
the usher): “Can you kindly tell me which
is Samson?”
“Florodora” returns to Her Majesty’s on
Saturday night next, vice “The Quaker
Girl,” who is to be given a well-earned spell.
“Ben Hur,” charioteer, drives out of Syd-
ney Royal after the performance on Friday
night. On Saturday, the old-fashioned but
enduring twinkle of “Harbor Lights” will
show the playgoer the right course to steer.
The drama with the nautical title is the one
in which the late Oily Deering, as the tine
old moral Captain, is alleged to have trum-
peted, “There is only one duty for an old
steer to star by, and that duty is salt!”
And he wasn’t supposed to be the master of
a cattle boat, either.
“What Women Will Do for Love,” the
instructive melodrama at the Adelphi, will
die a natural death to-morrow night, and
will be followed by “His Real Wife.” Pre-
sumably this is the one who only does things
for money. Already the management is
warning Sydney to look out for its Christ-
mas edition, “The Monk and the Woman”—
a title. suggestive enough to make a beauti-
ful mixing of the colors on the opening
night.

The Tivoli Cafe presents its menu : Janu-
ary, eggs ; February, bacon ; i March, eggs
and bacon; April, ditto; May, bacon and
Gggs; June —but the boss probably wonders
by that time when his patrons will get tired.
When they do he just substitutes ham for
bacon and trusts that everything will be right
again. Thus Harry Royall, lightning sketch
artist, almost treads on the heels of C. Le-
plastrier, lightning sketch artist. The
newcomer, who does his work in water-
colors—Leplastrier used chalks —calls for
neither a turnip nor a bouquet. Thomas
Bentley, a Dickens character-actor, is the
most tempting of the new baits this week ;
he doesn’t tread on anybody’s feet, which is
a blessed relief. The Schenk Bros., “equili-
brists extraordinary” (a revival), the three
Keltons, Nella Webb, Rallis and Wilson
(another revivaD and De Biere, still help to
keep Mclnstoush’s spirits up. Taylor and
Arnold (yet another revival) are announced
for Saturday.

On Monday, at David Jones’s (Sydney),
1 ercy Spencer commenced a picture-show
season—not the kind of picture show that
unwinds down-town Indians scalping hobo
pioneers on the rolling prairies of Coney Is-
land (N.Y.), but the kind that has drawn
crowded houses for Holman Hunt, Howard
Chandler Christy, and other brush and can-
vas showmen. Spence exhibits, in Jones’s
gallery, a year’s work, which pans out at
90 lots, offered in the bulk at a little over
£970, or, in samples, at almost any price
from one to a hundred guineas. As a
whole, the exhibition suitably represents
Spence in his-sometime flashes of high-grade
painting and attractive use of warm (though
always virtuous) coloring, and unsuitably
represents his weakness for the shallow work
that finds its level on popular wall alman-
acs. There is sufficient of this side of
Spence to considerably weaken his Show—
which is bad business management. But,
for that reason, art fiends and patrons
should not pass David Jones’s Lace and
Lingerie Colosseum without seeing the pic-
tures. Some of them may advisedly be pur-
chased, and if anybody hankers after an
opportunity to buy (say) “The Red Cap”
(£2l 10s.) for this scribe, no undue obstacle
will be placed in his (or even her) way.

Spencers this week have relied mainly on
“The Woman in White” to supply the divi-
dends. The lady walks out of the novel by
Collins, and sticks pretty closely to the orig-
inal ; and when one says that it is just about
enough. On Saturday what is billed as the
first all-local complete drama, <? The Mid-
night Wedding,” will be flicked. The actors
were supplied by Clarke and Meynell, and
the entire film was taken at the Rushcutter’s
Bay factory. This paper forwards a bene-
diction in advance.

The National Amphitheatre is starring one
Carl Merlyn, a magician who has arrogated
to himself the proud style of Human Incu-
bator. If put to it he can hatch anything
from plots to ostriches. Violet Black is in
her last nights, and so are Les Rinchs. In
other respects the programme stands more
or less where it did last week.
The heroine of “The King’s Romance,”
which happened at Melbourne Princess’s on
Saturday night, is not a painted lily or
footlights fascinator, but a peasant girl of
purest ways serene. She meets Prince
Andreas while he is out sketching, and, in
spite of the fact that he is dressed like a
pantomime principal “boy,” accepts his assur-
ance that he is but a numble artist. When,
later, she hints to him of something to be
feared, the person of purple blood and high
descent plunges into the shoals of morgan-
atic matrimony. The second act is laid in
the home of Andreas Cordellia, “artist”—
the programme sarcastically “quotes” it.
Mother and child. are both doing well, and
father is bearing up under his incognito.
Then the chief villain-in-waiting conceals
himself in the heroine’s bedroom, and when
he is discovered by the Prince chap the
seeds of suspicion are sown. While the crop
is growing, news comes that the king and
the crown prince have both died from
natural causes (i.e., a revolutionary bomb),
so the sceptre, crown, jewels and sundries
belong to Andreas. Leaving behind the wife
whom he supposes to have been guilty of
giddiness, Andreas ascends his shaky throne,
and allows himself to be betrothed to Prin-
cess Stephanie. Then the revolutionists get
busy again, and the outcome of another plot
is that the populace think his Majesty has
been blown to kingdom come. As a matter
of fact, be has returned to the forgiving
arms of the wife he left behind him, and
the two determine to lead the simple life,
disguised as ordinary human beings awav
from the fierce bombs that beat up™ a
Hn? ne ; n doming after such a horror at
The Tart Without a Roost,” this fantasy
seems sweetly reasonable. It is the Marlow
management’s gracious recognition of the
tact that the public which takes its nlea-
sures hellowdramatically is not composed ex-
clusively of marine dealers.
Hugh Buckler is a successful pantomime
king, just as Miss Violet Paget is a pleasing
musical-comedy princess. Kenneth Bramn-
heerf r> after Harr y Diver’s own
heart. D. Murray, as a cure, is unneces-
sarily prosy in his piety. The undersized
major domo, represented by D’Arcy Kelwav
would appear to have only lately been pro-
moted from the Boy Scouts; still he looks
a regal figure beside the members of the
untidiest royal bodyguard on record. Veri-
similitude gathers up her skirts and flees
in the first act; but, all the same, even if
“The King’s Romance” is a blithersome
drama, it is at least picturesque and
pleasant.
Arnold De Biere , magician, at the
Sydney Tivoli.
“Nightbirds” is still a subject of tropical
interest at Her Majesty’s (Melb.) ; but the
nights of this show are numbered, for the
day of the panto, approaches rapidly. So
those who wish to inspect the New Age
Prison and the Arum idly Club, not to men-
tion the club’s private ballet, are hereby
urged to get a move on.

In regard to “The Power and the Glory,”
resuscitated at the King’s on Saturday
night, this paper is content to remark that
while things might easily be better, it is con-
ceivable that they might be many degrees
worse. In fact, if the play’s abundant
bathos were rolled in a blanket and dropped
over Prince’s Bridge, and the comic “relief”
were hanged by the neck until it was dead,
and a pruning knife were applied to some of
the howling absurdities of the plot—if these
and a few other operations were performed,
“The Power and the Glory” might be better
than Hall Caine at his second-worst. In
the present production, although the comic
“relief” is beneath merriment, and the un-
pretentious furnishing of the Dyce Morris
mansion invites disrespect, some of the
mechanical effects are smartly managed,
and the principal performers are all right.
Cyril Mackay represents a J. Tar whose
face might easily be his fortune, and is re-
warded by the lifelong devotion of Miss
Eugenie Duggan. Miss Olive Wilton, wear-
ing a hemp-colored wig, makes a decorative
villainess; she sins in company with Rut-
land Beckett, whose crimes appear to bore
him dreadfully. As “Mar” Goodluck, Miss
Lillie Bryer would make an excellent model
for Alf Vincent, and should be kept in mind
by the artist in case the lady who at pre-
sent poses for pictures of the Argus should
one day feel her position so keenly as to
swallow a bucket of lysol. A blind child is
well played, on essentially theatrical lines, by
“Little” Sylvia Church. There are other
performers who escape notice, and will con-
tinue to do so unless they become a great
deal better or a trifle worse.
At the Royal “Get-Rich-Quick Walling-
ford” is still teaching the lessons that (a)
the way of the transgressor is dead easy,
and (b) the road to wealth is paved with
bad intentions. Probably the only thing
that prevents many citizens who view this
play from turning “crook” is the knowledge
that nowhere outside of Dramaland will
there be found a collection of “boobs” over-
flowing with the milk of human innocence
like the inhabitants of Battlesburg. One
thing in connection with the play that pains
this paper is the persistent celibacy of the
directors of the U.C.T. Co.. Ltd. In the
last act. when Wallingford has twins, and
everybody else, including the gum-sucking
waitress and the very juvenile Eddie Lamb,
are represented as married and in their right

There arrived at the Opera House on
Saturday Crawford and Howarde, a couple
of passable sketch artists, with “Two Doors
and a Passage.” In this comedy sketch a
fairly good idea has been weakly handled,
so that the dialogue scintillates like a lump
of dough, and a smart ending cannot efface
the recollection of the dullness of the play-
let. Mozzetto, the skilful coin catcher, and
Margo, the mystic barmaid, have returned to
the scene of their former moderate tri-
umphs. Claire Romaine has improved since
her inauspicious opening, and can be par-
doned for inducing the gods to act as non-
union choristers in view of the brightness
of the methods by which she. achieves their
co-operation. Alberto Marini (tenor) and
Taylor and Arnold (musical nonsensemong-
ers) are other contributors to the full pro-
gramme.

with its festive fighting and array of dead,
the crowd was fed on a few furlongs of Cap-
tain Scott’s doings in Antarctic regions,
with explanations and trimmings by a lec-
turer. An active drama, fat with incidents,
was “The Double Cross,” the subject of
conflict being a girl who looked a “peach”
in the film, and is probably a similar vege-
table in real life. The rest of the pro-
gramme (barring the elephantine absurdity
of “Dupin’s Electric Spark”) sustained a
moderate degree of excellence.

The long nap of Rip Van Winkle was
"West’s principal illustration in Melbourne
last week. The film was good, the acting
excellent, and the whiskers and cranial up-
holstery of the veteran dozer lacked nothing
in beauty or abundance. “Blind Love”
stirred all those who find spiritual entertain-
ment in the weeping and woe of the be-
trayed. The story dealt with a lone and vir-
tuous maiden who, getting the. glad eye
from a youthful sinner, muddles into matri-
mony, followed first by beer, a baby, and
broken hopes, and then by slow starvation
for baby, and a fractured neck for hubby.
Some refreshing PathAcolored views of the
River Eure (France) followed —presum-
ably to chase the gloom away.

The Smart Set Entertainers, who opened
their season at St. Kilda (Vic.) Esplanade
on Saturday night, include at least one
artist in Walter George, a comedian whose
ingratiating fluency forces the critic into an
attitude of respect. George’s work on his
own, or in company with Miss Georgie Mar-
tin, a lady with a merry tongue and a trip-
ping toe, is ever pleasing and light, refined
and decorous. The others include Miss
Emily Kroll, a tuneful soprano, and Edgar
Hulland, who strokes the piano with the
finesse of a society masseur. Another,
Edward Elliott, a ventriloquist, cleverly
cross-talks with a dummy of the usual order,
and tickles the audience with jests that are
as profoundly respectable as croquet and
macaroons.
“Jean Sibi” on another Art show: —
Miss Frances Hodgkins, the Maoriland artist who
went to Europe to soak in French impressionism, has
turned up at the Centreway, Collins-street, with 74
illustrations ot her experience. The worms mostly
deal brightly and spontaneously with French sub-
jects, but she hangs some bits of Dordrecht, at least
one sun-spotted' piece of Tangier (Morocco), and. a
very companionable jotting of a Venetian house, with
a refreshing foreground of bridge and water. Her
most unusual things are Breton babies; the one in
“Jean and Jeanette” is a fair example of the type—•
a real kid with a Mary brow and a secluded button
of a nose. The studies of “Le Plage, Concarneau,”
have nothing of the patient art of the photographer ;
they are, rather, memoranda of boats, water, bathers
and parasols, dashed off with an occasional flash of
power, but emphasising the importance of the color
over the human element. In the interiors, like “La
Femme Se Chauffe,” “The Family” and “The Repast.”
Miss Hodgkins is similarly impressionistic, and in the
breakfast subjects, Nos. 3 and 48, she exhibits some
charming painting. “Jacquelin” and “La Premiere
Communion” show the artist’s capacity to deuict
soulful womanhood, and “Le Pont Neuf, Paris,” is
distinguished by a handling that almost becomes a
happy style. Other efforts have obvious merits ; yet
the fair painter is in no immediate danger of becom-
ing popular. The average man regards her work as
the epitome of the shadowy and the vague—a hor-
rible drawback in the eyes of those to whom an
oleographic exactitude is the first principle of Art.

Things are quiet in the Adelaide “shops.”
At the Royal, Anderson’s co. is saving “The
Bushwoman” by good acting, though the
Australian setting helps. At the Tivoli the
sisters Macarte have come in, with their
Lotus-land scene. “My Fancy” still dances,
correct, graceful, but not exciting; Minnie
Kaufmann does daring things with her bicy-
cle; and Irving Sayles does ditto with his
face. Athos and Read are at the King’s,
also Phil and Phlora, Roy Rene, and the
immensely-encored balladist, Nellie Kolle.
West’s are starring “Greed for Gold,” a fine
of the modern film dramas, which
•steadily get less comprehensible without the
aid of programme-study. “Jim Bludso,” at
the Empire, however, tells its own story to
anyone who knows the ballad. Wonder-
graph shows the Light Brigade Charge, clev-
erly faked, and a second heat of its Beauties.
Concerts have been very fine and large, not-
ably one by Saint George and Hadley, visit-
ing English examiners in music. (What a
big aggregate in fees these outside
inations must take out of the country . Can t
the work be as well done here?) At the
Town Hall has been the Philharmonic
Society with Oscar Taueber, lately returned
from putting finishing polish on his fine
voice in Europe. Allen Doone has had a
good week in Broken Hill, with a selection
of his sugary Irish dramas. He is now
doing the country towns of S.A., which are
also catered for by the big Corrick family,
lately of Adelaide King’s, but now on tour.
AT POVERTY POINT.
From London: The Duke of York’s put one-act
pieces of Pinero, Shaw and Barrie on a triple bill ;
but Barrie’s “Rosalind” is the only contribution
that will stay. Most of us know that old women,
by various devices, can make themselves up to look
like sweet young things on the stage. This is the
idea that Barrie turns to account. Beatrice Page
is a brilliant young comedienne, supposed to be
only 23. who by her beauty and genius has taken
London playgoers by storm. When the papers an-
nounce that she has gone to Monte Carlo for a holi-
day, the truth is that she has gone to a little cot-
tage by the English seaside in order to be herself—
a stout, dowdy, matronly ladj r who confesses to being
“40 and a bit.” There she rusticates, free from
all her wearying stage devices. An ardent lover
discovers her in this retreat, and fancies she is
mother of the charming actress to whom he lost his
heart in London. In the end a telegram is placed
in her hands. Her London manager is in a pre-
dicament, and must revive “As You Like It” at
very short notice. She is wanted at once to play
Rosalind and repeat her former, triumph in that part.
Exit Beatrice to her room, to emerge presently the
radiant, sprightly young actress. The quick change
is wonderfully well done by Irene Vanbrugh, who, a
few may remember, was in Australia with J. L.
Toole. The character was evidently written for her
by Barrie, who fitted her splendidly.
Bernard Shaw’s latest little thing is “Overruled,”
erratically labelled a “demonstration.” It is just
the same old ventriloquist Shaw using figures, to ex-
pound his views on things in general. There are four
characters —two husbands and. two wives. Of course
they pair off, each with the other’s partner-in-law.
Sitting on a sofa in turns, they fire off Shaw’s topsy-
turvy notions and glittering paradoxes on the re-
lations of the sexes. There is no .plot—conversational
fireworks, and nothing more. The talk gets sultry,
at times, and some of the critics think the censor
ought to have made holes in the MS. and let in fresh
air.
“J.F.H.” (from London): Is Pinero played out?
It looks like it. All his recent productions have been
failures, either absolute or comparative, and now
he has added another frost to his winter. He was
associated with Barrie and Shaw in a triple bill of
new one-act pieces at the Duke of York’s, and his
was the only one of the three that was sniggered at
by the audience and condemned by the critics. It
was called “The Widow of Wasdkle Read,” and was
described as a fantasy. It is really a ridiculous yarn
about a widow whb kept a country hotel, and whose
deceased husband paid her a weekly visit as a ghost
at 10 p.m. every Friday. He cable down the chim-
ney to the accompaniment of howling winds, falling
tiles, banging doors and any amount of old-fashioned
blue fire. Pinero evidently thought this sort of
childish theatricality would impress the audienoe, and
send it into a husbful awe, instead of which the
audience laughed and jeered at the utterly uncon-
vincing and obviously substantial ghost. The widow,
of course, has a lover, handsome Vernon Steel, who
has a tremendously long amatory speech to deliver;
and that was another heavy handicap. Pinero’s ex-
perience as an actor before he bechme a playwright
ought to have told him that ghosts do not “gee”
upon the stage, however well they may go in Christ-
mas stories, and that a lover who “proposes” in a
10-minute speech, crowded with flowery adjectives,
has not learned the A B C of his business.
“Ami”: Julius Knight returns. Coppin said that
three last appearances were allowable: the Last,
Positively Last, and Most Positively Last. Even af
that the Artful Dodger did not stop vanishing.
Knight first came to Australia in ’9l, as second to
Alderson, who was Laura Villiers’s leading man.
They opened with “The Dancing Girl.” As a star
he came with “The Prisoner of Zenda,” “Under the
Red Robe,” and “Sign of the Cross.” It is time
to size him up. He ranks with Bellew, and is a
grade below Rignold. I think him rather more
like Montgomery than any actor who has since ap-
peared. Without a dictum that his Silver King was
the best, 1 will declare that in this and Superbus
he was better than Barrett, though probably never
so good an actor as Barreft was at first. Knight
may have been annoyed at being so much of a fem-
inine idol; but what could he expect when Monsieur
Beaucaire fitted him so well?
“Stargazer”: A very Hibernian show opens in
Melbourne at Christmas, the appeal of which to the
Celtic imagination is to be heightened by sprinkling
a layer of real Irish soil along fhe gangways leading
to the seats, so that patrons who are exiles of Erin
may have the felicity of treading on the “ould sod”
once more. Boxes of rale ould Ireland have been
brought to Australia for this purpose, each box
accompanied by a certificate from an eminent au-
thority in each county as a guarantee of good faith.
Pretty well all the Irish have left Ireland. Here
begins the migration of Ireland itself. Shiploads
of Tipperary and Connaught and other parts of the
most distressful country are going to America for
similar purposes. If Home Rule is not hurried up,
there will be no home left to rule.
London’s patriarchal actor-manager, Joseph Arnold
Cave, has entered on his 90th year. He started as
a boy of nine playing Tom Thumb in a burlesque,
put in a good deal of work in music halls and tea
gardens, and then became associated in opera with
the Hodsons —a father and two daughters, Henrietta
and Georgina. The former married Labouchere,
M.P., of London Truth ; the latter became wife of
W. S. Lyster, Australia’s operatic king of olden
time. Cave describes the future Mrs. Lyster as “a
young lady of charming appearance with a well-
cultivated contralto voice.” An early friend of his
was John Dunn, “a very popular comedian,” and
afterwards one of the pioneers of negro minstrelsy
in London. Dunn migrated to Australia, where he
achieved popularity as an actor. His two daughters,
Rose and Marian, also became favorites in Melbourne
and Sydney. Rose married L. L. Lewis, the Mel-
bourne grain broker; Marian became Mrs. Marcus
Clarke. Cave is now an inmate of the Charterhouse.
“Hamer”: The closing up of the .Sydney Palace
Theatre recently was about as solid an illustration
of the growing scarcity of public cash as could be
given. Five months ago any rotten show could
make money in any theatre in Sydney, and the sign,
“House Full,” would be up on Saturday night. What
a time we had! Theatres, picture-shows and other
places of alleged amusement were simply slopping
over. Yet only a few years ago, with picture-shows
practically unknown, and the Lyceum closed, it was
reckoned that Sydney had one theatre too many.
Still, I won’t say that things are bad now. At most
of the big houses business is from fair to good, and
various suburban dramatic shows, which a few years
back would have been an impossibility, are making
bread and onions.
"NIGHTBIRDS," AT HER MAJESTY’S,
MELBOURNE.
Reg Roberts
becomes a
Count.
The Comic
Lawyer.
Wonderful the memory of these “memory” show-
men. Datas, who recently toured Australia, is back
in London, and telling the interviewers all
about it. “As we took as much as £.2000 a per-
formance, we had to be careful about bushrangers.
We were all armed at night and did sentry-go in
turns.” And he recalls that it was 120 degrees in
the shade when he had duck and green peas at
Adelaide on Christmas Day. By the way, Datas
shouldn’t mind a little heat. He was a stoker in a
London gasworks before he discovered that he could
make a better living by remembering some things
and inventing, the rest.
“Parisine”: Sarah Bernhardt’s 69th birthday was
commemorated in London by the presentation of a
testimonial with 100,000 signatures. Our Sydney
friend Beauchamp presided. Mrs. Bancroft read the
address, and Beerbohm Tree and the French Ambas-
sador spoke. Sarah replied in the purest English,
greatly to everyone’s surprise. Her performance
that nio-ht was in the Coliseum Music Hall, with a
magically powerful scene from “Phedre,” immedi-
ately following an hilarious turn by three clowns.
Probably, like Ristori, with Lady Macbeth, she will
yet give something in English.
Ellen Terry, Henry Irving’s long-time leading lady,
rarely gets a chance of facing a London audience
now. But she had it the other night, when she
rushed on to the stage of the London Coliseum with
a big wreath for Sarah Bernhardt. Also she read a
speech in which she gushingly apostrophised Sarah
as the reigning queen of the dramatic world, and
classed herself among the most loyal of subjects.
Sarah, in reply, kissed Ellen on both cheeks, and they :
came hand-in-hand down to the footlights to acknow-
ledge the applause. After which the ancient Ellen
retired, with the now rarely-heard cheers of a London
audience ringing in her ears.
“A.McD.”: “Harrison 0.” says wrong when he
says that Tittell Brune played “Fedora” in these
parts. The massive Nance O’Neil was the last
Yank actress here to agitate herself and her audience
in the name part, much to the discomfiture of the
late Thomas Kingston, who as Ipanoff suffered much
in the love scenes from Nance’s exaggerated caresses
and avoirdupois. The lean Brune appeared in two
of Sardou’s excitable and gory dramas, “Theodora”
and “Tosea,” but not in “Fedora.”
“Val. Day”: With regard to the misuse of the
word “some,” it did not originate in America. It
is used in precisely the same way in some parts of
provincial England. I had once a. friend, a York-
shire wool-buyer, who warmly remarked to me,
apropos a comic opera ballet lady: “Aye, mon, but
she’s got some legs!”
“G.T.”: The just-dead Penley (“Charley’s Aunt”)
'was an eccentric little cuss. Once, in Cornwall, the
“house” not being as good as he thought it shoujd
be, he made a speech, denouncing the town and tlroke
of its inhabitants who had failed to put in an ap-
pearance, eventually stating that there would be no
performance and the ticket-money Would be re-
turned ; but he would be glad if all would remain
as his guests for supper and dancing. Some 60 of us
—audience and co. —sat down to as good a nieal as
it was possible to secure on such short notice, with
as much champagne as we could consume. On an--
other occasion there was opposition in the nature of
a struggling band of players who had billed “The
Streets of London.” Penley, hearing they were in
low-water, cancelled our performance, booked seats
for us to witness the other show, and again gave
way to his mania by entertaining both companies to
supper. Latterly he had an idea that he could write
plays. Nothing delighted him more than to come to
your room about 2 a.m., sit on" your bed and read
something he had written, acting each character as
he thought it should be acted. The effect in the
pathetic scenes (he usually wrote sentimental stuff)
was very sad, indeed.
“B.J.”: On November 30, at 10.30 a.m., a fire
broke out in a building in Collins-street (Mel-
bourne) , where a number of films and sundries be-
longing to the J. D. Williams people were stored.
The same evening, at the firm’s Melba Theatre op-
posite, pictures of the flare-up were screened. This
is rather more noteworthy than showing the Cup by
bioscope a few hours after the race, as in the latter
event full preparations can be made beforehand,
whereas the fire picture was a smart effort to make
the best of a bad job that wasn’t expected.
“Ireland To-day,” the song-and-picture show which
has brought a ton or two of the ould sod with it, is
to be screened for the first time at Melbourne’s Town
Hall on Boxing Night.
Dead in London, at 65, Richard Temple, the ori-
ginal Mikado (to Grossmith’s Lord High Execu-
tioner) ; also the original Pirate King, and the
original Dick Deadeye in “Pinafore.” In fact, he
had a steady job in the old Gilbert and Sullivan
days, but latterly music-teaching had not kept the
wolf from the door, and a benevolent fund was being
raised for him when he died. A sympathetic visit
from Sarah Bernhardt brightened the old man’s last
week on earth.
“Val. Day”: Apropos “Harrison O.’s” par. con-
cerning “Fedora.” It was played here several times
prior to Sarah Bernhardt’s arrival in Australia. Just
immediately before Sarah’s advent, Janet Achurch
and George Titheradge fought out the duel of the
last act at Sydney Criterion.
“Flinderino”: I was at Paling Creek the other
week, and had the good fortune to meet Spiller’s
Continental Picture Company, which arrived in a
waggonette. The show was' well worth the bob.
Professor Spiller took the money at the door and
turned the handle of the picture machine, and Mrs-
Spiller worked the phonograph and attended to the
wants of her infant offspring. The first picture was.
a military drama, and towards the end of it the
audience got quite enthusiastic. But just as the
bugler hero was galloping on his charger, through,
shot and shell to save the wounded colonel, who
should open the door but Jim Preston,' from Wild
Dog Gully, bringing his missus and mob of young-
sters to see the show; and of course the rescue had!
to be suspended while Professor Spiller climbed
down from the table to collect the admission money.
Mrs. Spiller hadn’t many phonograph records, and
it was only by accident if the “music” suited the
picture. When the screen showed the mullet-
stained fisherman finding the body of the fair-
haired child, after the big storm, the talking-
machine spoiled the pathos by shrieking: “You
should see me dance the polka!” Another film was
“Cattle Dipping in Queensland.” This picture was
extremely popular, ticks being very bad in the
Paling Creek district. Everybody cheered when
some heifers had to be pushed info the dip. Then
a young Jersey bull came through the race and
plunged in. The annual was completely covered
by the liquid dip ; and at that critical moment the
wind blew and the professor stopped turning the
handle while he stepped down and shut the door. The
women got very hvsterical because they reckoned the
bull would be drowned : and everybody was visibly
relieved when Mr. Spiller resumed the winding and
the prize beast scrambled out of the dip unharmed.
“ ’Twas a narrer squeak;” the cockies told each
other.
“IL”: One of the results of the last
Trades Union Congress in Sydney was a
decision that the long-talked-of Federation
of Labor should be proceeded with forth-
with. Although unions are sometimes sud-
den in regard to strikes, “forthwith” in a
matter of this description often means that
in a month or so somebody shall begin to
think over it- in a leisurely way. In this
case, however, the Labor Council is already
considering a Constitution for the Federa-
tion which, if accepted, will mean a loose
amalgamation of all the labor unions in N. S.
Wales. The Labor Council, which has in
the past acted as the connecting link between
a number of unions, had no real control ;
and the new idea is to make one homogeneous
body. But there is a dispute between the
Labor Council unionists, who want the
Labor Federation to be practically an ex-
tension of the Labor Council, and the coun-
try and unaffiliated unions, which desire the
creation of an entirely new body with which
the Labor Council can affiliate. The coun-
try and unaffiliated unions represent the
more militant section of unionism. As far
as matters have gone, the Labor Council has
its way in the proposed Constitution—which
is not wonderful, seeing that it was mainly
Labor councillors, with a keen regard for
the vested rights of the Council, who drafted
the Constitution. Vested rights are as
strong in the unions as anywhere. Whether
they will secure their end eventually is
not at all certain; but in any case, the
form of union organisation in N. S. Wales
is likely to have anew aspect very shortly.
NEVER SCORN THE ’OBBIES OF A GRAN’DAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though music-hall song has had plenty to say
about Mother, very little attention is paid to another
good old institution, namely, Grandfather. Here is
a slight attempt to do justice to our ancient friend.
The scene it was a stately ’ome, the spuds was grow-
ing cold,
The gravy ’ad a look of deadened woe,
While a middle-aged and massive gent, did rouse and
swear and scold
At an aged man with locks of scattered snow ;
The old man was ’is gran’dad, and now it would
appear
’E’d smirched the fam’ly record many a day,
For servants from that lovely ’ome ’e’d sent for jugs
of beer ;
But, ’ark! I ’ear the old man rise and say:—
Chorus:
Never scorn the ’obbies of a gran’dad,
Never make ’im bow ’is ’onored ’ead;
Remember, lad, you’ve only one more gran’dad.
And Vs not ’ere because ’e’s five years dead;
You may think I ’ad a rat to run the rabbit;
You may think it 10w,., now you’re a great J.P.;
But a drop o’ draught’s, a comfort, and I’ll have it,
Even though no more your ’ome should shelter
me —e-e.
Within that rich and lovely ’orpe there was no eye
was dry,
Loud tears was ’eard to break the saddened calm,
And the middle-aged and massive gent, e’en ’e was
’eard to sigh,
And to say, “Well, p’r’aps you never meant no
\ ’arm.” >
’E offered stout, champagne and schnapps ’is gran’-
1 dad’s thirst to slake,
Bbt still for good draught beer ’e e’er did pray;
So all you rich and wealthy gents I ’ope you’ll pat-
tern take
By what this old and ancient man did say:
Chorus: Never scorn the ’obbies, etc.

LEADING THE STRENUOUS LIFE.
SHE: “ Goodness, Bertie, what have you been
doing? You look quite fagged out.”
HE: “No wonder, Gwenny. I’ve had such a
strenuous morning — I’ve been choosing a
dog-chain for Fido.”
“U.K.” from the London end :—•
About 99 British papers have burst into pictorial
and literary enthusiasm over the quarters prepared
for the young Prince of Wales at Magdalen College,
Oxford; but the amazing thing they can’t get over is
the bathroom installed therein for his Royal Highness.
It seems that the long line of noble marquises, dukes
and earls, who have honored Magdalen with their
presence, have never demanded such eccentric extras
as baths, and the innovation has shocked the ancient
greybeards of the College. But Queen Mary, who
wants to be known for common-sense as much as
Queen Alexandra for beauty, is a law unto herself,
and she bounced the authorities into a hot and cold
water installation before Edward went up. So now
the future King of England can have his daily wash
like any Australian clerk.
The Rev. J. E. Watts-Ditclifield, the peri-
patetic parson who on diverse occasions
severely rebuked Australians for their
imperfections, has returned to Eng-
land. He tells John Bull that we
are not serious-minded. It is true in
a general way, too. What the Ditchwater
cleric overlooks is the fact that we have no
urgent cause for the saving grace of lugu-
brious expression. Certainly we owe John
Bull a lot of money; but while this may
assist John to take his pleasures sadly, it is
not sufficient excuse for national down-
heartedness in Australia, and cannot be ex-
pected to create an air of settled melancholy
in this life —an air so dear to Sour-
bellies, and so essential to a proper appreci-
ation of the happiness of the life to come. It
}s characteristic of the Wowser that he ex-
pects man to be perpetually sorry for him-
self, and tries his darnedest to make him so.
* * * *
“The Poor Farmer” : Consider the charity
of the rich —and the charity of the poor.
All the year round the benevolent wives of
the rich give their cast-off clothing to the
poor; and we think pretty well of them for
it —there are thousands who won’t do even
that much. That’s one side of the picture.
Here’s the other. On a recent Monday
morning a gang of shearers was leaving the
city for Albury express at Spencer-s'treet
(Melb.) One was having a last drink at
an hotel opposite the station, holding his
swag, now his sole worldly possession, on his
arm for safety. So standing, he was accosted
by a friendly stranger, and asked to have a
drink. Another _ drink followed, then an-
other. By this time the swag had been put
down. Then the warning bell announced the
train was leaving. The shearer grabbed for
his swag. It was gone. So was the friendlv
stranger. However, the man just caught
the train with a gone feeling on his shoul-
ders. The language of the rest of the gang
on hearing his story was all that it should
be. Then ohe said: “Well, chaps, it’s no
use us saying what we would do to the
blanky viper. What are we going to do
for this bloke? He can’t be left to face the
track broke and swagless, too.” Opening his
own swag, he brought out a new blanket,
saying: “Here’s my bit to it.” Immediately
every swag was unrolled, and I noticed each
donor gave the best article he possessed of
the sort that was wanted. One gave new
boots, another a new hat; there were new
socks, new towels, new handkerchiefs. Then
all was neatly rolled up and secured ; and a
tucker-bag was filled with sandwiches and
oddments. This done, they looked blankly
at each other. No one had a spare billy.
However, one or two of us came to the res-
cue with the needful for that —and r little
over. That’s the charity of the poor. God,
it’s a beautiful thing!

The bosses of Australia’s naval staff are
in imminent danger of being assassinated by
the managers of Hobart’s public baths. It
appears that some gay sea-dog has caused
the new drill-hall for naval cadets to be
erected on a site overlooking the ladies’
bath. Whether this was done with the ob-
ject of adding allurement to a life on the
ocean wave is not hinted, but the baths com-
mittee does _ say that if there is any allure-
ment it will not be felt by its bashful
patronesses; in a word, that they will
tremble to go to sea clad only in a cling-
some bathing gown and a swirl of foam un-
der the festive —nay, devouring—eyes of the
budding buccaneers. Maudie Melbourne or
even Maudie Sydney wouldn’t mind; but
Maudie Slowbart —never !

There was a loud guffaw from the Pie-
bald papers the other day over a press wire
from Port Darwin announcing that “Mrs.
Gilruth and children” were leaving “the
Residency” to go south for the summer
season. But the Piebald newspaper com-
mentators might at least have added that
Mrs. Gilruth didn’t know what a N.T. sum-
mer was like, and was merely taking the
Piebald papers’ word for it. And they
might also have added that the same Port
Darwin wire which told of the flight of the
Resident’s wife from a terror she didn’t
know also told this (S. M. Herald,
20/11/T2) :
Mr. W. G. Stretton, who retired last month after
47 years in the Government service, 43 of which
have been spent in the Territory Civil Service, is
also a passenger. Another identity is Mrs. Tuckwell,
who arrived in the Territory 43 years ago, and has
never since left the country until -the present time.
She is now proceeding to Sydney on a visit to her
eldest son, whom she has not seen for over 30 years.
After being 13 years in the country, her husband
died, leaving her to face the world with a young
family. She has quite a number of sturdy grand-
children, all of whom were born here. They are hale
and hearty in appearance, and should go far to dis-
prove the idea that white women cannot reside con-
tinuously in this tropical land and retain normal
health. She is accompanied by one of her grand-
daughters.
Recently an ex-Government Medical Officer,
with a few months’ experience in the N.T.,
tickled the Piebald papers with the sug-
gestion that, though the first generation up
North might do all right, the third would
probably be all wrong. Evidently the hur-
ried doctor hadn’t met the sturdy Tuckwell
grandchildren.
APPLIED ECONOMICS.
MAIDEN AUNT: “ Never waste anything, Dora. If you keep an article- for seven years,
you may be sure you will find a use for it.”
DORA: “Well, supposing you bought a cradle, auntie?”
A Murray Bridge (S.A.) man has got
off a fine for “fighting in a public place” on
one of the oddest pleas on record. The
fine was only £2 and costs, but he appealed to
a Judge in Adelaide, on the ground that no-
body nad done any stoushing but himself
He hired an expensive lawyer to argue that
“a man could not fight without an oppo-
nent; a fight and an assault were quite dis-
tinct.” The Court said that this was so.
It went so far as to be “sorry the informa-
tion had not been laid under another sec-
tion, as undoubtedly there had been an as-
sault.” But a fight it was not, and the
conviction was quashed, with costs against
the police for not recognising an assault
when they met one.
THE IRREDUCIBLE MINIMUM.
V ISITOR: “So your daughter painted that
beautiful picture?”
MRS. UPSTART: “My daughter paint it? No,
indeed! Her teacher did the work. And,
considering what we pay him for lessons,
it was the least he could do. ”
“Oxon” considers the foundations of the
Throne:—
The yarns which the papers printed last month
concerning the sequestered life the Prince of
Wales was to lead at Oxford turn out to be quite
wrong. He is to have rooms in College like any
other Magdalen freshman, attend lectures and hall,
play games, and in general behave like the average
undergraduate. This is what one would have ex-
pected. There are_ all sorts of indications that the
Royal Family realises the advisability of getting on
good terms _ with the democracy. An easy way to do
this is to .jettison all side or swank. The old Duke
of Cambridge was hopelessly incompetent, and as
Commander-in-Chief was a menace to the nation.
Yet the crowd liked him, and so did the army—
chiefly because of the friendly way in which he used
to blaspheme at all and sundry. Edward VII., when
he was at Oxford, had a residence to himself—•
Frewen Hall. He did not join in the University life
proper, and only mixed with a few of his friends.
That would never do in this age of Lloyd Georgian
measures, personal journalism and pretty-well uni-
versal education. The young prince’s mission in
life (the mission, indeed, of all modern princes) is
to make himself popular with the crowd —if possible,
as popular as Danny Maher, or Vic Trumper, or
Harry Lauder, or some national hero of that sort.
To that end he will require to mix geniallv with all
classes, and be shown in the act by the illustrated
papers. Pictures will shortly be streaming from
Oxford to wherever the British flag flies (and else-
where) depicting the Prince walking down “the
High, entering Vincent’s, riding with one of the
Drags,” motoring, consorting with dogs, and doing
the other things which the nation expects of him.
And thereby “loyalty” will be vastly augmented,
the historian of the future will nrobably devote
pages to a consideration of the favorable influence
of the rise of the illustrated weeklies on the posi-
tion of the monarchy. These journals are the revo-
lutionaries deadliest foes. By the way, it is a
startling innovation for the Prince to be sent to
Magdalen. From time immemorial the “blood” has
Church—“the House,” as it is known
of „ the ’Varsity. Edward VII. was
attached to the House, and in his day it would
have appeared unthinkable that he should go any-
where else. 6 3
_ A cry is being raised in Adelaide—of all
cities—for more open spaces. It comes
from the suburbs. The city itself, with its
squares, and park-lands, and Botanic Park,
has a good deal more open space than it has
of street or building. But, once outside the
park-lands, the new suburbs have of recent
years eaten up the paddocks for miles every
way, and there has been no Colonel Light
to lay them out. Where anything has been
reserved at all, it is an “Oval” for sports
purposes, and though every house, however
small, has its own vine and peach-tree, there
is no public garden among the lot of them.
So everybody is saying that somebody else
ought to do something about it.
THE GLORY OF WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wasteful as war is, it produces a beauty and
splendor of character; it saves us from slipping back
iinto warm, comfortable, easy lives.
— Rev. Canon Hughes ( Melb .).
In sloven peace too long we dwell;
Our hands are soft, our livers white.
In selfish ease we bloat and swell—
Our men are spoiling for a fight.
Ring out the dreadful bell, and call
The slaj'er to his proper strife.
Spread reek of powder over all,
And let the ruby blood-clots fall
To sweeten our Australian life.
War makes the man, ennobles each.
It isn’t altogether nice,
But gracious lessons it can teach,
And make us grand in sacrifice—
The Christian preachers tell us so,
While far the belching cannons boom.
Ah ! Nought of war’s fine stress we know—•
The bayonet thrust, the cleaving blow—
Is softness, then, to be our doom?
Nay! Let us pray the God of War
To send a foe or help us find
On some hot, Asiatic shore
An opening to improve our mind !
The women’s shrieks, the towns ablaze,
The babes struck dead, the bloody clan
That murders maidens in the gaze"
Of dying fathers, these can raise
Redeeming elements in man.
War sets the savage loose again ;
The enervation and the sloth
Of modern years go out in pain,
And we are ape and tiger both.
War breaks and burns, but pity will
The slayer cleanse when all is o’er;
War ravishes and ruins, still
We learn the hardihood to kill.
God send the New Redeemer—WAß!
niCTOTaA,
EDWARD DYSON.

“10-2-4": For the Oldest Parliamentary
Chestnut On Earth Competition I enter the
following relic from last week’s debate in the
Australian Parliament: —
Mr. Howe: Let the cad go on.
Mr. Kelly: That is about the one subject on which
the hon. member can pose as being an authority.
Utter collaose of Howe. While first aid to
the wounded is being administered, Kelly
leans proudly back and makes a spirited
attempt to look like Nero. How often, I
wonder, has this doddering old shaft of wit
been projected across the world’s legisla-
tures? Harley called Robert Walpole a
rogue about two centuries ago. Being re-
luctant, for many reasons, to go into the
matter in detail, Walpole remarked darkly
that his assailant was a good judge of rogues,
and let it go at that. For many years
thereafter the repartee was extremely popu-
lar in Europe. Casanova always used it
when he was charged with card-sharping.
In his case it was merely a sort of pour
parler preliminary to setting about his
accuser with the first lethal weapon that
came handy. In much the same circum-
stances, Abul Kasim Mansur (“Ferdusi”),
greatest of Persian poets, told his patron,
Mahmud of Ghazni, that he (Mahmud) was
an authority on plagiarists. This occurred
in the Diet of Ghazni circa 965 a.d., and
well nigh cost Abul his life. Going still
further back, there is indisputable evidence
that the Apostle John oenounced Cerinthus
(the notorious Judaieo-Gnostic heretic) for
a Schismist —the social equivalent in those
days of a modern Wesleyan; whereupon
Cerinthus retorted on John that Apostles
were good judges of Schisms. John took
the full count, and was helped to his dress-
ing-room in a speechless condition. In the
time of the Ptolemies ——- Rut enough. I
have already said sufficient to show the ven-
erable age of this gag. As regards utter
staleness, there is nothing in vaudeville itself
to approach it.,
* * * *
“Ruru”: “Powerite.” an explosive in-
vented and tested in Sydney, is now being
examined by the British Admiralty with a
view to helping the business of naval de-
struction which is the object of all naval
construction. Just 100 years ago Cochrane,
afterwards Admiral Dundonald, offered the
War Office an explosive, or something, which
he claimed would smother Napoleon and all
his works in one act. As late as the Crimean
war, when the great seaman and inventor
had had his claims to genius fully recognised,
he again brought forward his proposal, and
offered to destroy Sebastopol without losing
a man. The War Office still holds that plan
or recipe or prescription among its deadest
secrets. It :was pronounced to be effective,
but too inhuman. The secret might be use-
ful to Australia when it gets up against the
jagged edge of Asia. We have a truckload
of Peace Society literature that we could
afford to swap for it.
FOR SWEET CHARITY.
LADY C OLLECTOR: “Your friend Smith is
horrid-refused to give on the grounds that
I was a wayside beggar."
GOOD SAMARITAN : “Uncouth brute! And
what did you say? ”
LADY C OLLECTOR: "Merely apologised for not
recognising him as the Pharisee."
The official design for the Federal capi-
tal has been published, and shows a garaen
city surrounding a broad waterway. ine
thing suggests that the water is intended tor
mirage, or that the Government has defi-
nitely taken upon itself to shift the Snowy
or perhaps one of the big rivers of the ISlorth-
ern Territory. A note of explanation, how-
ever, explains the seeming mystery. An ex-
tensive waterhole can be made in the alleged
Molonglo .River, and, by careful manipula-
tion, it is calculated that just enough now
can be maintained to keep the liquid from
becoming absolutely stagnant. This is plea-
sant reading. In ordinary seasons the Fed-
eral city will possess a wonderful mosquito
breeding-ground, and in times of drought
there will be a fine expanse of highly-flav-
ored mud, revealing on its breast the remains
of the dog that died and the cat that per-
ished by violence.
MISCONSTRUED.
S HE: “ Isn't she a sight in that hat!"
HE: “ Yes! Charming!"
A Simla, parson, called Martin, has -been
interesting himself in the time-expired man
of the British army in India. Every year,
it seems, some 7000 men in the prime of life
are thrown out with only a few
pounds in cash to save them
from suicide or return to the
Gold Country. The Simla par-
son thinks this stream could
with advantage be diverted to
Australia. While he was talk-
ing there were 20 men ready to
go to Australia if they were
asked—ages from 25 to 37 —and
the only mystery is why they
don’t come along without being
asked. There is no earthly
reason why discharged soldiers
shouldn’t make good settlers.
Macaulay somewhere tells of
the veterans of the English civil
war in the 17th century, who,
after their training by Crom-
well, settled down to work in
such a fashion that you could
pick out a Parliamentary sol-
dier anywhere by the way he
went about his day’s graft.
There is a big opening for a
Minister with ideas to devise a
garrison settlement of reser-
vists in the N.T., and ask any-
body who has been used to
handling a rifle in India to come
along, and, in the intervals of
growing cane, or cotton, or beef,
or old, or tired of waiting for
the trans-continental ralway, to
help shoot invaders. Sydney
and Melbourne have no special
use for the time-expired man, except to
run messages, attend to lifts, or help to
fill the ranks of the generally useless, but up
in the N.T., with a climate to suit him, big
prospects ahead, and the knowledge that he
was a man of some account in the com-
munity, Tommy Atkins might develop the
best that is in him.

“Hooray”: This shows how State Parlia-
mentary influences spread. At a local
(N.S.W. backblocks) meeting of the magis-
trates to issue auctioneers’ licenses, one ap-
plicant, who had not put his application in
writing, was refused. Wanting to know the
reason, he asked the C.P.S. That monarch,
putting on all his majesty, said: “See me in
my room.” (Laughter in the court.)
The Bill to amend the Evidence Act,
which has been introduced in Victoria, pro-
poses to blot out the custom of kissing the
germs on the court Bible. It is proposed that
a witness shall henceforward take the Book
in one hand and hold the other fin aloft, or
perform some other exercise in gymnastics.
But why drag the Bible into the business
at all? Is one man in 10,000 stopped from
lying because he happens to have the Sacred
Word in his neighborhood? If he feels like
lying, the only thing that will block him is
the horrible suspicion that he will probably
get two years’ gaol if he is found out.
* * * *
“Dungaree”: “Bosun’s Mate” (B.
7/11/T2), discussing the N. S. Wales
Marine Court’s judgment on the two coast-
ing masters who did not obey the pilot’s
signals at the Nambucca and Bellinger
Heads recently, regrets that the Court did
not have the true facts before it.
He wants us to • believe that the
skippers do these mad acts very
frequently and only get caught
once in 100 times; also, that they
do them out of consideration for
farmers, fishermen and other cus-
tomers. Rubbish! The risk is
mostly taken by men who, not
being able to keep in the good
graces of their employers by merits
of their own, make asses of them-
selves and risk life and property—
which any fool can do. The Navi-
gation Department is to be con-
gratulated on at last taking the
stand it has, and, as one of the
cloth, I hope the next riian found
guilty will have his ticket cancelled
altogether—he isn’t fit to’ have
charge of a vessel who risks life
and property when there is no
necessity for it. I am personally
acquainted with all the pilots on
the North Coast; they are experi-
enced men, unhampered by ship-
owners or other persons, and
therefore in a position to act
fairly to all. They have through-
out my long experience of them
endeavored to help masters, though,
no doubt, there are some who are
too ignorant to see it. But how-
ever that may be, all doubts are at
an end now; and in future if the
owner asks us why we did not
cross in. we have but to say:
“Stand-off signal ur> , sir!" > More-
over, I hope that the pilots, recog-
nising the greater responsibility
now thrown upon them, will re-
solutely show that signal when-
ever the safety of a crossing is in reasonable
doubt. If masters are not allowed to “risk
it” on their own responsibilty, the pilots
shouldn’t give them a chance to do it on
theirs.

That unfortunate Queensland boundary-
rider who had to hack off his arm to escape
from a tree, and then died from loss of blood,
was after some young galahs he had heard
calling. Now comes word of a case from
Victoria in which another parrot-spoiler has
come to an untimely finish. The boy went
up a tree to a nest, leaving a loaded gun
some distance away. When he was half-
way up, his eight-year-old brother picked up
the gun, and happened to touch the trigger.
The charge had the whole expanse of heaven
to spread itself over, but needs must fly
where it could do most harm, and the un-
fortunate climber got the lead in the abdo-
men. He was hurried to hospital, but died
next day. There seems to be a curse on the
parrot-raider.
Cambridge University always had the re-
putation of being a bit radical in its views ;
and the other day its authorities by a large
majority decided to throw open its theolo-
gical degrees to laymen. This is no doubt
owing to the absurdity of having to confer
the degree of Doctor of Laws on any visit-
ing Premier who may happen along. Some
of the Premiers are local preachers and
might be. much more suitably branded Doc-
tor of Divinity. There is Bigjohn Forrest,
LL.D., for instance. Anybody who ever
heard that ex-explorer in his prime would
recognise at once that nothing but a Divinity
degree would rightly reward such fluency.
* * * *
On the word of Commander Nares, of the
naval survey ship Fantome, there is enough
work on the North-West coast to keep 10
ships going for 20 years. That is 200 years’
sounding and chart-correcting in a region
where the work is particularly difficult. The
Fantome, during its recent trip, found that
an island which is passed by the Darwin
boats was five miles from the position indi-
cated on the chart. And an uncharted reef
pinnacle with only 12ft. of water over it was
discovered in the exact spot reported by sev-
eral coastal skippers. Poor old coastal skip-
per, with one eye on the lying charts and
the other on marine courts waiting to grab
his “ticket”! But things will be brighter
for him when the 200 years’ surveying job is
completed. Meanwhile, he can navigate by
smell—and be ready to take the three tons
of consequences if his scent is defective.
“Y.Z.”: There has been a little mess-up
in Melbourne, and a discolored brother has
got his face broken. The m§l6e was pretty
brisk while it lasted, and might easily have
been worse: and the fact that it happened,
and the incidents that led up to it, should
incline the Federal authorities to submit
an educational test in Arabic or Babylonian
to the next bunch of all-black entertainers,
seeking to invade Australia. It isn’t con-
ducive to the preservation of his Majesty’s
peace to see large, loud, black masses 'of
Africa towing white Australian women about
an Australian town. The “dorg” of Mars
Johnsing in such circumstances is intoler-
able. _ It inspired the healthy objections of
certain turbulent young gum-suckers of the
right complexion, in Melbourne, and some
aggression on the part of the dark showmen
precipitated a free fight. White women who
take up with transitory coons may not be
worth rowing about; but no matter how in-
ferior the Circassian beauty, the racial in-
stincts of a white are outraged when he sees
Ham making a flamboyant demonstration
of the acquisition of her; and if quite a
tribe of_ flash Zulus pervade a town display-
ing their snoil the demonstration amounts
to a clamant declaration of war.

A champion mean man hired a boy through
the Vic. Labor Bureau in June last, at a
wage of 10s. per week, fare (Melbourne to
Cope Cope) to be refunded if he stayed
three months. The youngster stayed 19
weeks, but when his farmer-employer paid
him off he thoughtfully deducted (1) the
fare; (2) 6s. 6d. for the use of a pair of old
blankets; (3) 9s. for alleged lost time; and
(4) 6s. for light, soap, matches and towel.
A Footscray Bench ordered the thrifty farmer
to pay the full amount claimed, with 19s.
costs. This apostle of Thrift would make a
good mate for another farmer at Turkeith,
near Colac (Vic.), who got a lad of 17 from
the Neglected Children’s Department, and,
finding him a lusty youth, sent him to a
lonely place in the bush, scrub-cutting. The
youth was to get 10s. a week, but no wages
had been paid when the police came on the
scene, though a guarantee had been given to
a distant storekeeper. The police, lumbering
into the business through the youth having
broken into a house and annexed food anu
sundries, they found him starving, ragged
and dirty, and without even a bed to
lie on. What the Neglectful Department
was doing it hasn’t so far explained, but ap-
parently it just handed the lad over to an
employer, and then disremembered all about
him.
DRASTIC MEASURES.
“At met a chappie about a month ago, and he
seemed awfully naice, you know; be bor-
rowed £10, and do you know Ai haven't'
seen him since."
“ What are you going to do about it?"
“ Well , if I meet the wretched fellow Ai—Ai
Ai won’t speak to him."


As, a block of sandstone was being
removed from a depth of 10 feet, sev-
eral- human footprints were observed
on the face of the stone, and It is
expected that others will be uncovered

of the age of the footprint is from
20,000 to 30,000 years.—News item.

cold and influenza, but also cured my two children
when they had whooping cough.”*

“Billy Blueshirt”: The cow cocky is not
the only child sweater in the country by a long
way. In fact, I think the bullocky can give him
points, although, of course, the oxologist is not
nearly so numerous as the cow specialist. Still,
there are a good few of him, and I am domiciled
just now where he dominates the landscape. Know
one with a family of boys, ranging in age from
seven to fourteen years, and, so help me, I’d
sooner be one of the steers than any one of the little
human beasts of burden. Know a 13-year-old son
of another oxologist who has been to school fully
25 to 30 days out of every 100 for some years. He
is hunted out of bed summer and winter long before
daylight to round up the bullocks, while H.R.H.
the old man enjoys an hour or two extra sleep.
Running about all day in the scrub, doing the
work of a youth of 16 or 18, because their fathers
are too miserable to pay a man, these boys become
stunted in mind and body. One I saw the other
day had a livid stripe from thigh to ankle where
his apology for a father had laid the bullock-whip
on to him. Another of 13 had the nail torn com-
pletely from his finger by some of the gear used
in hauling pine from the dense scrub and rocky
gullies. Don’t know how some of their young
bodies stand the ill-usage they are subjected to,
but I suppose we'll discover that when the N.S.W.
Government appoints the commission of inquiry.
It’s promised for 1920, isn’t it?
STRAIGHT TALK.
INDIGNANT L OAPER: “Talked to 'im straight ,
I did. If you want a job done, I sez,
don’t ask me; get a bloomin’ emigrant.
Wot does our Government ’ave a himmi-
gration policy for if it ain’t to give the
cows jobs?”
“F.J.D.”: I agree with “Yarrum” (B.
7/11/’l2), that an “authority on Australian birds” is
wrong when he states that the curlew (or stone
plover) builds a nest. But “Yarrum” is just as
wrong when he wants us to believe that the eggs are
hatched by the atmosphere. Mrs. Curlew sits on the
eggs just like any other decent woman-fowl. But
the bird is very alert, and steals away unobserved
when an intruder approaches; and this, no doubt,
leads the casual observer to believe that the eggs are
left to the mercy of the elements. Nor is it com-
pulsory on the lady’s part to deposit the eggs on
rock or loose stones, for I made my observations 100
miles from the nearest rock.
“Pakiri”: Held a bush section back-o’-
most-things in the Aponga (M.L.), andwas begin-
ning to feel the symptoms of Vanderbilt when the
pheasants descended upon the place. They _ rooted
up my early potatoes, chewed up the seed maize and
played fried Sheol generally. I placed the position
before the nearest neighbor, and was told the remedy.
“Get a gallon o’ proof rum,” said old ti-tree whis-
kers, “and I’ll come over.” We soaked a bushel of
maize for eight hours in the bulk of the grog, spread
it thick over the potato patch and went to bed.
About dawn we were awakened by hilarious squawk-
ings and beating of wings. Hurried out to find the
potato patch in the possession of a herd of the most
inebriated feathered dissipates imaginable. The hens
clucked around foolishly, sidled, tripped and whirled
the glad eye promiscuous-like. As for the roosters,
they were dividing their time between free fights,
spooning with the other fellow’s wife, snoring ori
their backs, singing “For He’s a Jolly Good Rooster,”
and other pleasantries. We added two waddies to the
entertainment. Washed down a brace of the slaugh-
tered for breakfast with the balance of the rum, and
sent the old cocky home with as much game as he
could hang round his moke. I’ve tried this dope
scheme several times, but I’ve never made a success
of it unless I used rum. The birds won’t look at
whisky.
* * * *
“Yanna”: I must have struck the cow
kids’ millennium. During several weeks spent in
and around Colac I have investigated the cocky as
he worships in South-western Victoria, and I have
searched in vain for the anfemic and sleepy kids
and the slave-wife of tradition. Hereabouts the big
stations are gradually disintegrating, and the sec-
tions are being snapped up for dairy farming. On
approaching the shrines, the first sounds you hear
are the asthmatical coughs of the internal-combustion
engines. Inside the sheds I found milking machines
in universal use, separators driven, by machinery and
bosses leaning up against posts watching the milk
cans fill. Surely this must be the Toorak of Gow-
dom, for many of the owners have families of but
one.

“R.8.M.”: Re the shearer’s “Send it
down, Hughie!” (B. 14/11/’l2), when needed
rain is threatening. I first heard the ex-
pression in Narrandera (N.S.W.), where it
was common among the boys of the village
when J. Pluvius cut loose. I believe that it origin-
ated in that district, by reason of a Mr. Huie, form-
erly station manager of Widgeon and Buckinbong,
being an amateur meteorologist, who had luck in
prophesying rain, a cyclone, or water-spout or some-
thing. The success boomed Mr. Huie in the prophet
business. Hence, “Send it down, Huie.”
* * * •
“Yarrum”: The Kiama (N.S.W.) Blow-
hole, which once attracted thousands of people yearly,
is just about at its last gasp. The constant rush
of water has so worn the once rugged
under-rocks that there is nothing left to
break upon, and the consequence is no
blow, and no spray sprinkled far and
wide through the opening in the roof.
I have seen tons of ocean flung far above
the lighthouse, and the wet went close to
reaching that height during last winter’s
violent storms ; but, in ordinary weather,
the thing is now just a feeble rush, a
gurgle and a groan. The aldermen have
thought of having the place cemented
below, in order that the rush of water
may have something to rush against; but
they are a bit short of money, and are
waiting until they can raise a loan “to
purchase the cement.” Yet in all those
bygone years, when the poor old hole
was laboring and going strong, the en-
terprising villagers never thought of mak-
ing a decent track down to it —a track
that might have been cut for £2O. The
approach to it is over rough and fire-
eaten scoriae—light stuff that came down
on the surface of the basalt (blue metal)
when it rushed in a molten stream from
Saddleback, where once was an active
volcano. To get to the aperture and back,
a distance of not more than 100 yards,
one would almost wear out a pair of
bluchers. If Cohen, or somebody, will
only lend the money for the cement, the
Blowhole will live again; but, if not, the
thing is going to peter out very shortly,
and then half the glory of Kiama will
have departed for all time. Everything
—even a Blowhole—depends on Cohen
nowadays.
“Konini” : Professor Macmillan Brown, an
authority on the peoples of Polynesia, has just returned
to Maoriland after another visit to the Islands. In
the Malay Archipelago he found the natives of the
various islands “enfeebled, riven by disease, and
with no other prospect ahead than annihilation.”
As long as the Dutch let them engage in warfare
and head-hunting they remained fairly virile. Now
that head-hunting and warfare have been put down,
they loaf about and let the women prepare the sago
for them. The result is that they will die out. In
Dutch New Guinea and in the adjacent islands, few
children are to be seen about any village. The men
spend most of their time in the kaiwaris, or bache-
lors’ houses—temples in the old days from which
women were warned away by the sounding of bamboo
trumpets—and in these places they indulge in the
vices of Sodom and Gomorrah.
Brown comes to the final opinion that the one way
to save the islanders is to cut down every sago
palm, sugar palm, and everything that gives either
intoxicating drink or too easy food; and make the
beggars work. In proof of the value of hard toil, he
quotes the “fairly prolific populations” of Java, Bali
and Lombok. Personally, I’m glad to hear there
is some use for work. Up to now I’ve been wonder-
ing what it was invented for.
THE SACRED ANTMAL.
JOE (to Bill, who has Just had a trifling accident with his gun): “My word , yer lucky!
It might a been ha' blanky side worst!"
INTELLIGENT COCKY: “My oath , it might! Why, yer might ha' killed one o' the cows!”
“Six-tooth” : In these humanitarian days,
when a section of the public may be expected to
raise a protecting shriek in the interests of any
animal, from a docked horse to a child-violator, one
wonders why poor jumbuck has been overlooked.
Recently I was present at a shed which, besides
shearing its own flock, removes the jumbuek’s over-
alls for numerous cockies in the neighborhood. The
usual question of wet sheep arose, but on this oc-
casion the difference of opinion existed in the ranks
of the barbers. The minority against work showed
its resentment on the sheep. Result, a big per-
centage, was left for the crows. Jugulars were
cut, eyes were gouged out, and generally the poor
brutes were peltless. The procession of maimed
animals which preceded Cocky on his homeward jour-
ney would have satisfied a flying Turk.

“A.M.L.”: My father’s surname is im-
material. As proof that we are not devout Wesleyans
this story will suffice. Three generations of us are
known to our parents as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
I am Isaac. Young Jacob, aged eight, attends the
local Public School. A spelling-bee, extending over
a week, has just been decided, and my son and heir
ran into the semi-final. He baulked at the last
hurdle, ran a glorious second, and all Israel is proud
of him. He has achieved immortality. When asked
to spell “pig’s flesh,” he did, thus: “P-A-W-K.”

“Aiteca”:, Has any Abo-liar ever run
across red prawns alive ? In Vatulele, near Suva, there
are a number in a pool. They are all well and
happy, albeit they look as if they had been cooked.
The only explanation I have been able to obtain as
to the curiosity came from the Fijians. They report
that, in a forgotten year, a goddess who lived on
the island paid a visit to a male spirit on the main-
land. After spending the week-end, the lady was
pressed by her lover to marry him, but refused to
do so unless he built a bridge across 20 miles of
ocean to her island. This he declined to do, owing
to the shortage of labor, which had been driven out
of the country by Private Enterprise. In any case,
the scheme did not appeal to him, and he cussed
it so vigorously that the lady hurriedly grabbed
what tucker she could from the breakfast table and
fled. Amongst the food were some cooked prawns,
but as she did not eat them on the journey, owing
to a preference for cold shin-bone and guava jelly,
she threw them into a handy pool on her arrival, and
restored them to life in thanksgiving for her safe
home-coming. Can’t vouch for the truth of the
story, but the headman who told it me said he
had it first hand from the goddess, and she ought to
know.
“Gouger”: Occasionally the busliman has
the luck to find in the dense tropical scrubs of Nor-
thern Queensland the rare white orchid. Some little
time ago one of the precious parasites was found on
Darnley Island, and brought its finder £4OO. A
find in New Guinea, recently, was sold for £5OO,
and a flower from Friday Island (opposite Thursday
Island) realised £350. A couple of months ago a
nigger brought one of the perfect white, bell-shaped
flowers to Cooktown, where he sold it to a man in the
street for five bob. Passing a dentist’s, the man in
the street was offered a pound for the pretty pot
plant, and accepted gladly. In his turn the buyer
was offered £5O for his bargain; but he knew a
thing or two, and refused.
* * * *
“A. Borig”: Can any Abo-liar name me
any reptile or beast that can stand as much fire as
a rabbit? I know of none. The other 99-in-the-
shade day I heaped leaves,
sticks, etc., on and in the end
of a hollow log I wished to
get rid of, and lit the lot.
In a few minutes I was ob-
liged by the heat to retire 20
paces. Saw a commotion in
the heart of the fire, and a
squealing rabbit emerged and
got for all he was worth. My
little dog caught him —and
promptly dropped him, as he
was red hot. Nothing else
that I know could have lived
10 seconds in that fire. Re-
cently burnt out a huge blackberry bush and killed
dozens of half-roasted rabbits getting away from
it. Several days after my greyhound chased a
fearful looking reptile, and was afraid to pick it up.
I shot it, and found that it was the remains of a rab-
bit. Not one patch of fur was left on, and the skin
was like charcoal. He was a hard-looking case, but
was well enough to be feeding when I first saw hijn.
Are rabbits “ ’arf-carsk” chameleons?
* * * *
“Fritz” : Re the performance of the female
“barking spider” in- order to attract the attention of
the male (B. 7/11/’l2). In the case of the common
bee, there are enough males (drones) to mate with
scores of females (queens) ; yet very often the queen,
who mates on the wing, pairs with a drone from a
different hive. This is particularly noticeable in
connection with bees which hive in hollows of trees,
stumps, etc. Originally black, the majority of bush
bees are now hybrids, the queens having mated with
Italian drones. In some species of wasps the males
are wingless, and live on tufts of grass, shrubs, and
even on the ground. When the female needs a mate
she flies low, making a peculiar little buzzing, till
she hears the answering one from the male. The
females of some moths exude a substance which at-
tract males from a considerable distance. In some
forms of aphis (green blight on roses and black
blight on peaches), and phylloxera, one mating fer-
tilises not only the mating female, but also the
females of the second and sometimes the third
generations.
* * * *
“Pick”: “Te Babarantiko” might secure
octokittens in the manner he describes (B.
14/11/’l2). Indeed, it does not need an iron bar
such as he angled with to dislodge even a fair-sized
octopus from her marine fireside. All that is needed
is a bit of crab or fishbait on a gaff-hook, held near
the hall-door. This is grabbed by ’pus, who may
thereupon be hooked and yanked forth. For the old-
man octo-tom-pus, however, “Te Babarantiko” should
have more respect, and less sympathy. He says his
friend the nigger hacks off the tentacles that are
thrown round him. But what good is that when
every part appears to have a life of its own? Long
after severance from the main body, the feelers still
cling as tenaciously as death will to “Bab.’s” sable
companion when he is over Jordan.

The toiler in the dusty street
Hung to a bucking, half-ton plough
That strove his wiry arms to beat,
And toss him like a sulky cow.
Four horses tugged the thing all day;
The pug-nosed ploughshare, short and stout,
Dug deep into the lower clay,
And tore the tough macadam out.
Behind him, at some little space,

The rails and sleepers into place
On which to run the coming tram.

AUDIBLE EXCELLENCE.
CHATTY LITTLE MAN (who takes his soup

LIVERISH DINER: “Umph! Don't know what

“Casabianca”: The immigrant may be a
congenital idiot, and worthy of our scorn, ridicule
and contumely, but he gets back on us sometimes.
One of him, writing in the London Magazine, on
the Commonwealth as a field for immigration, says
of the Australian: “ ‘To-morrow will do’ is his daily
motto.” Viewing the isolated and unguarded N.T., the
inadequate Defence measures, the emasculated anti-
trust legislation, the breaches in the tariff wall, and
the complacent attitude of the average bloke regard-
ing these and sundry other calamities, I reckon that
writer hits us where we live. The immigrant may
be the idiot; but who’s the fool?

“A.Y.A.”: Anybody ever noticed the im-

when any Binghi will* without any bother, bring in
a kerosene tinful of the bee-juice for Is. and the loan
of an axe. I remember only one white man who was
immune to a bee’s tank-sinking apparatus, and he
was dead'.

“Chump”: It is my painful duty to inform
you that a Olontarf ornithologist has strayed into
your two most interesting pages. His name is
“Yarrum.” He says: “No bushman I have interro-
gated has observed the young or nursery curlew.”
Rot! All bushmen have seen them, and every rab-
biter in the West has at one
time or another liberated them
from rabbit pit-traps. Next
he berates a school paper for
the statement that “the curlew
builds a nest like a fowl.” I
don’t know what sort of a
nest “Yarrum’s” fowls build;
mine have their nests built
for them. But the curlew
does make a nest—not an
elaborate affair, but a nest of
dried grass and twigs ar-
ranged in a scratched depres-
sion. She lays two eggs, and
sits upon them. Again, he
states: “The parent wood-
ducks take hold, one on each
side of the tips of the duck-
ling’s wings, and flutter up to
the nest with it.” Again
(and more firmly) ROT! The
young ducks are certainly
helped to the water when
fairly small, but they never
leave it, except to hide in the
undergrowth along the edges,
until they can fly. Does
“Yarrum” know any bird
that returns to the nest, once
having left it ? This gentle
sport goes on to say that he
had his gun, but refrained
from murdering parent ducks
with their young. I did not
know the man was out of
gaol who would even contemplate such a thing till
I read his par.
* * * *
“Cherry Tree”: After giving matrimony a
fair trial, young Mrs. Brownjones stunned her de-
voted husband and gave the suburb a delightful
shock by eloping with Smithgreen, a gay bachelor
from the next-door boarding-house. The deserted
husband went into mourning as regards his face, and
assured his shocked friends that he would forgive All
if she could only be induced to return to him.
After the lapse of some months, his message was
conveyed to her by a friend who looked confidently
for (1) a flood of repentant tears, (2) passionate
renunciation of the tempter, and (3) a grand recon-
ciliation. But all the ambassador of peace got was
a scornful sniff. By next mail, the expectant hus-
band received a letter from his fugitive missus.
There was only one enclosure —the pawn ticket for
Mrs. Brownjones’s wedding ring and keeper. Not
a superfluous word of explanation. That eloquent
three-ball document was the whole dictionary.
* * * *
“Shollum”: Re deep-borrowing vegetables.
We have here, in Maoriland, a weed known as the
Californian thistle. Its roots are found down 18ft.
In fact, at Stirling, on the banks of the Molyneaux
River, I’m assured that it has burrowed down 30ft. ;
but, being a modest liar, I’ll stand on the 18ft.
“Karee”: Re “A. Kito’s” par (B.
14/11/T2), has any cow-worshipper sampled dugong’s
milk? The “sea cow’s” lacteal fluid is the same
as the land ditto’s save in (1) color, which is akin
to the smile of a Chow Lepublican; and (2) quan-
tity, which, I will take my oath, colonial and other-
wise, surpasseth Yassberra’s water supply. The lady
keeps hqg juice in two teats under the flappers, hence
my never attempting to bail her up, and only milk-
ing her after sending her ad patres per medium of
a harpoon. By the way, you can’t tell fresh dugong
flesh from beef and salt ditto from bacon; and
both’ll keep longer than the land varieties.
“Nuki”: If ever you wander up our way
in Maoriland you will be quite sure to meet Simon,
the Perryman, for 40 years the pride and terror of the
district. I spent a variegated year there as school-
marm, and know all about crossing in Simon’s punt.
When you reach the river bank you shout for the
ferryman. There is never hny response. Then you
go up and tap timidly at his door. “Whassermar-
rer 7” comes a roar from inside. You ask meekly
; if Simon would mind taking you across ; and if you
are of an abnormal courage you mention that you are
rather pressed for time and would like to catch a
train. “Well, don’t make a ’ole in my door,”
rumbles the voice from within. Then a pause..
After that: “Why couldn’t you come ’arf an hour
ago? I’ve just took over three cows and 10 people.”
Ours is a prosperous dairying district, and we
always mention the cows first. You apologise,
and sit on your carry-all to await developments.
They don’t come. “Won’t you come now, Simon?”
you ask, suavely, after a wait of 10 minutes.
“Well,” says the voice “ye’ll ’ave t’ wait till I’ve
et this ’ere sossidge. I dunno wot y’r want alwus
cornin’ at meal times. It’s a wonder I ’aven’t died
afore this with runnin’ off with me meals ’arf et.”
But Simon always cheers up when the punt is half-
way across. “Them wires is wearin’ out,” he says, con-
templating the punt’s overhead supports. “Well, it
ain’t my fault. I’ve told the Road Board about
’em.” Silence for 20 seconds. Then, “Females
wouldn’t ’ave no chance in this river. Too much
current.” But you must call Simon at night—pre-
ferably from the opposite side—if you want to see
him at his best. Nervous travellers have been known
to turn back rather than risk nearer acquaintance
with the apparition; but most people just sit down
and wait.

“F. 5.8.” meets a Poor Lot:—
After the natural rejoicings had been expressed, and
the long sleevers recharged, my curiosity got the
better of me.
“Well,” said I, proffering a match for the disrepu-
table bundle of , paper and sweepings that served my
companion for a cigarette, “what was the strength of
the whole thing, anyway ?”
The man lounging beside me at the bar was short
and thick-set. His arms were long, and his lower
jaw, bristling with the accumulation of several days,
seemed to be making a reconnaisance under cover.
His hair shone with oil, and, parting at the side,
curved in a beautiful wave over his low forehead. A
tie of emerald and vermilion—or so it seemed to my
dazzled eyes—divided an expanse of soft and very
soiled shirtfront; and a limp bowler hat successfully
defied the laws of gravitation at the back of his
head. His coat, trousers (upheld by a strap) and
vest (which was open) did not appear to be on
speaking terms. As he was a particular friend of
mine, recently acquitted on a charge of unusually
gross assault on a constable, I was anxious to hear
his own account of the incident.
“Well,” he said, spitting on the floor, “it was this
way. Us blokes was all in Flanagan’s, and a bloke
come in we didn’t know. After a bit ’e started to
get fresh, so we put ’im out.”
“Was he hurt?” I asked.
“Nah,” he replied. “I don’t think so. ’E on’y
caught the kerb with ’is shoulder when ’e come down.
But ’e was a nark, and come back with a bleedin’
John. Of course we wasn’t goin’ to stand that, so
we all gets to ’im. But, stri’ me if ever I see such
a lot of bleedin’ wasters in me life. W’y, look ’ere,
I’d got the bleedin’ John against the bar, and was
knockin’ ’ell outer ’im, and when I got ’im
down —-when I got ’im down, mind yer ! —not one of
’em had the bleedin’ pluck ter put the boot inter
’im!”
Eddyson : Calf love may be a harmless,
humorous sort of complaint in cold countries but
here in Australia I have met with so many manifesta-
tions of its fervor, and have found it developing so
many dangerous elements, that I am now instinc-
tively cautious when in the vicinity of a youth be-
traying symptoms of it. I recall the case" of Theo-
dore Holewell, of Poolgard (Vic.). Theo was a
whip boy at The Whiz, rising 13, a pale-faced, stub-
nosed, black-haired boy, with freckles and large,
soulful eyes. His affection for Mrs. Kenyon was
made apparent at the dance and supper in the battery
house, with which The Whiz Gold Mining Cos. opened
its marvellous plant of five stamps. He did not
come much higher than Mrs. Kenyon’s lap, but he
hung round the lady’s skirts with "the pertinacity of
a famishing poddy, and gazed at her with great,
devotional eyes for three solid hours, shifting his
position to keep her in full view. Then, when she
refused to dance with him, he made a deliberate
attempt to poison himself with a tin of anti-friction;
for which he was presently compelled by force of
numbers to take half a quart of tepid mustard and
water, when the fountains of the mighty deep were
broken up, and grease was restored. Mrs. Kenyon
was a big, raw-boned, roach-backed, equine sort of
female, with a nose like a cane-cutter, and a mouth
like a nasty accident with an axe. She thought she
appeared ridiculous with a stunted youth of 13 tag-
ging after her, looking as damp and dolorous as a
cold in the head, and wanting to kiss her large,
homely, red hand; but Kenyon imagined it to be a
splendid joke, told it everywhere, and guyed Theodore
about it all through the shift. Presently things be-
gan to happen. A pick fell on Kenyon when riding
up in the bucket, Mrs. Kenyon nearly trod on a 6ft.
black snake when coming from the kitchen door, and
would have been bitten had she not thrown the reptile
into convulsions by thoughtfully spilling a quart of
boiling cabbage upon it. Later, Kenyon found an-
other black snake in his coat, and on a subsequent
occasion there was such delay on the part of the
whip-boy in getting him away from a blast in the
shaft that half his whisker was blown off. When
Mrs. Kenyon was driving out from the township in her
spring-cart, the horse bolted, and ran into a tree. It
was discovered later that the horse had had a hot
•nut placed where it would be most likely to excite
the animal. At the Methodist picnic, at Spooner’s
lagoon, the plug came out of the boat Mrs. Kenyon
was in, and Mrs. Kenyon and the others would have
been drowned if they had not walked ashore. It was
only two nights later that the Kenyon’s hut took fire
from without, and Kenyon was awakened by Theo-
dore’s strenuous efforts to rescue Mrs. Kenyon by
carrying her from her bed. The fire was extinguished
by an eye-witness, who testified that little Theo. had
carefully lighted it before going in to rescue his big,
bony beloved. In the presence of a small com-
mittee, Theodore confessed all. It was his intention
to rescue Mrs. Kenyon and leave Kenyon to fry. He
had trapped and provided the snake Mrs. Kenyon had
nearly trodden on, intending to save her with
dramatic impressment, but had miscalculated. The
snake in Kenyon’s coat was his agent, too. He had
dropped the pick on Kenyon ; and the argument with
the whip-horse at a crucial moment, which nearly
resulted in Kenyon being blasted into fragments, was
another of Theo’s ideas for ridding himself of a
dangerous rival. The sweet child it was who applied
the hot nut to the horse, and extracted the, spigot
from the boat, hoping to earn Mrs. Kenyon’s undying
gratitude by rushing to her rescue. He had been
thwarted of his stirring tableau on both occasions.
He loved Mrs. Kenyon, he hated Kenyon, and he
wished he was dead. When Kenyon had done with
him, Theodore still wished he was dead, and in his
coffin —face downward, for choice.

“Fritz”: “Eucalyptus Ernie” wants to
know (B. 14/11/’l2) if gohannas swallow quandongs,
and thus scatter the vegetables over the Outback
landscape. Don’t know, but have seen emus play-
ing golf with ’em, and the pace at which the “ball”

THE NEW TIGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Speaking at North Sydney anent the Governor-
General’s “eviction,” Alderman Milson declared that
“the scheme was nurtured in Socialism and hatched
in disloyalty.”
Lo! the addled egg has given forth another brand of
brute—
A fearful thing that isn’t fowl, or flesh, or fish, or
fruit!
The Socialistic Tiger was, at any rate, defined —
But this outrageous animal I cannot bring to mind.
The Tiger of the Olden Time worked by a rule of
thumb ;
He sent the hearthstones flying to the realms of
Kingdom Come;
He used to chew the marriage lines into a slimy
pulp
Before he chose to swallow tnem in one tremendous
gulp.
And when the meek investor came, his millions to
invest,
That tiger used to wink and say he liked investors
best.
The meaning was significant—and so the man of
wealth
Careered across the ocean in the interest of his
health.
That tiger, though ferocious, was consistent through
and through—
But this new perpetration is a trifle humpty-doo.
The old could be depended on to eat his proper fare;
But this new brute eats anything—and eats it any-
where !
Not only does he swallow creeds and chase investors
back,
But—was there ever such a brute ?—he eats the
Union Jack I
And could he only get his paws upon Old England’s
Crown
He’d scoff it, and with blue blood wash the costly
mouthful down.
And, furthermore, I dare suggest that not the Crown
alone
Would satisfy his appetite—he’d want to eat the
Throne!
No king or queen could venture forth into the tiger’s
sight;
The Empire, too, would disappear—a country at a
bite!
He’d rend a thousand titles in the passing of a day;
He’d swallow ev’ry nobleman who dared to bar his
way;
The British Navy might be safe if it were far from
shore;
But Heaven help the Army—’twould be eaten to the
core 1
And now I say the Time is Ripe. I beg to move that
we
Entice the brute into a trap with baits of Royalty.
And when we’ve got him fixed to rights we’ll pommel
at his head
Until he’s most prodigiously and permanently dead.

Many respectable men, says the Lord Mayor, sometimes take
a little more than is good for them. Especially in the hoq
weather. He urged that for such temporary lapses otherwise
well-behaved citizens ought not to be taken down to a police
court. In many American cities, a city patrolman, on finding
such a citizen temporarily
“overcome,” would call a
cab, and carry him off to
Town Hall, and then
fine him—when he
came to, of course!

A REVIVAL OF NIGGER MINSTRELSY.
The Speaker recently likened the Legislative Assembly to a nigger
minstrel show, with himself as interlocutor. This seemed to be the
meaning of a cryptic utterance made in reply to a question.

Corner Man Wood (Bones): “Can you tell me, Mr. Speakah, why dis
yere Parliment am like a hen settin’ on China eggs?”
Interlocutor Willis: “Look here, Niggah, you’s out o* order. Foolish conun-
drums like dat can’t be axed in dis yere House without a month’s notice.”
Interlocutor Willis: “Sahgeant at AhmS.
remove dat disorderly niggah.”
“Mr. Speakah, I apologises.”
The Roads Improvement Bill was lost in the ’Ouse by a vote of 28 to 29.
No wonder this sort of thing happens:—
Goulburn, Wednesday.—An accident occurred to a passenger motor-car last evening on
the Braid wood-Tarago road. The car was carrying 16 persons, and when about two miles
from Braidwood turned a complete somersault, landing on the wheels again.
(P.S. —If anybody thinks it’s easy to draw a motor-car and 16 people upside down, then
just let him try it, that's all!)

SAM COPLEY, Westralian Cattle King.
Another well-known Australian who bids
fair, in the next 20 years or so, to succumb
to the undermining influences of a sub-tropi-
cal climate is Lewis Thomas, a Bananaland
M.L.C., who recently celebrated his 80th
birthday. Thomas, a typical Welshman,
went to Queensland in 1859: dropped natur-
ally into coal-mining; made money; had a
spell in the Assembly; then retired to the
Council; and stands to-day a white-headed,
nale Bananalander, short of speech, Welsh
of temper, painfully Tory in most of his
views, but a decent, generous fellow for all
that. That Northern climate is always try-
ing—to nonagenarians.
From a London press veteran: —
The Daily Chronicle is so far scoring best in
war correspondence. It had a first-class corps of
correspondents on the spot in good time, chief among
them M. H. Donohoe, the Sydney man, who got an
early tip of the Portuguese revolution of a couple of
years back, and was the only English correspondent
who witnessed the fall of the monarchy and the ex-
pulsion of King Manuel. That gave the Chronicle
a big scoop. He is now with the Turks, and has
already sent a number of vivid despatches. The
Chronicle has made a departure in securing a ladv
war-correspondent, Miss May E. Durham, who is
attached to the Montenegrin Army, and has trans-
mitted some excellent copy. She lived in Montene-
gro for many years, and has thus the advantage of
considerable local knowledge.
lli e Dean Curse missed one man—James
Dues, the Sydney P.M. before whom the

The newest explorer of Dutch New Guinea
threatens to be Carl Lumholtz, of Christi-
ania, who has done a good deal of the same
sort of work in Mexico. Various European
geographical societies are giving him a hand.
Meantime, A. S. Meek, the acclimatised Aus-
tralian who made one expedition into the
Snow Mountains of Dutch New Guinea in
the interests of millionaire Rothschild’s bird
and butterfly collection, has been getting
ready at Thursday Island for another climb.
Lumholtz is making Batavia, in Java, his
starting point, and proposes to rely largely
on Dyaks from Borneo. Meek, whose first
expedition was very successful from the bug-
hunter s point of view, prefers to rely on the
British New Guinea “boys” whom he has
worked with for years.
“Searchlight”: Frederick Dillon, one of
the hardiest pioneers of the Dorrigo big
scrub (N.S.W.), lately tumbled into afflu-
ence. Dillon had toiled among the cedar
since the lO s, and had succeeded in raising
, young Dillons. Life on the plateau in
the early days was not beer and skittles.
I ractically isolated, the Dorrigo’s best door
to the outside world was a steep and tortu-
ous mountain bridle-path leading down the
famous Dorrigo mountain and into the
coastal settlement. All the while this nioneer
was putting up a stiff fight for himself and
family about £33,000 was looking for him.
No advertisements succeeded in penetrating
the cedar scrub. C. G. Wade is said to be
some sort of connection of Dillon’s, and in-
terested himself in the business, and tne re-
sult is a half-share in £66,000 for the old
man and his wife. Forty years ago Dillon
was taken with an idea to go to Sydney to
inquire about his relatives, but was ’dis-
suaded from what his family considered a
wild-goose chase.
Re the Rev. Dr. Keenan, lately deceased,

of the case, the order unhesitatingly decided
not to accept the money; and the money has
accordingly not been touched.
Died on Sunday,, at Mudgee, Nicole Sim-
mons, eldest son of the late Charles William
Lawson, of Mudgee, and great grandson of
Kieutenant William Lawson, one of the three
explorers who were first to cross the Blue
Mountains, in 1813. While the lieutenant
was Commandant at Bathurst in 1820, he
made explorations to the northward ’and
discovered the Moothi or Mudgee country
where he took up land known as Puttabucca.

Cox who built the first Mountain road,

“0.C.C.” gives an old pressman a send-off:
A great and picturesque old figure in Australian
J“ u , r . nallsm disappeared when Edward Ellis died in the
Melbourne Hospital a few days ago. Ellis was born
as long ago as the first day of 1825, and was in
harness right up to August last. Intended for the
iloyal Navy, his tastes took him straight into the
printing office. He was articled with Eyre and
Spottiswoode, the Queen’s Printers, and rapidly be-
came reader and literary manager of the publishing
department. He constantly met Charles Dickens,
Anthony lrollope, Charles Reade, and other mid-
Victorian literary luminaries; and, having a flashing
wit, a fine voice, and good presence, he cut no small
figure m literary London from the ’so’s to the early
70 s. He joined the Standard as a dramatic and
musical critic, and remained on that paper until
Captain Standish (the editor) and the proprietor
quarrelled and parted. Standish started The
Hour, a daily, ana Ellis was sent on a special roving
commission for the new paper. He saw the chief
cities of the U.S.A., and did some-brilliant descrio-
tive work. At ’Frisco he met the De Youngs, of the
Chronicle, and the brothers induced him to join
them. But San Francisco in 1874 wasn’t the most
law-abiding place in the world, and when, one morn-
ing, an assassin walked into O. H. de Young’s room
and shot him dead, Ellis took a dislike to America
and came to Sydney in the steamer that brought lima
di Murska and the Italian Opera Co. During the
37 or 38 years he lived in Australia, Ellis made many
friends—and a few enemies. He worked hard, but spent
or lent or gave as long as he had a pound. He started
many papers and edited many more. Australia owes
its Sunday papers to him. When, with the Rids-
dales, he founded the Sunday Times, the Wowsers
of that day reckoned that the Second Vial was opened.
They moved the Attorney-General, and, actually",
summonses were issued aginst some of the runners.
But Ellis checkmated in one move. He prepared
summonses by the hundred against everybody and
everything that was “infringing” the Sawbath. The
Law was thus bluffed out, and the Sunday Times
was left in peace. The Globe (evening) and the
Referee were two offshoots of Ellis’s vigorous per-
sonality, and the Westralian Sunday Times, which
he started in conjunction with F. C. B. Vosper and
the writer, was (and is) another monument to his
memory. Yet, perhaps, his- most enduring achieve-
ment was the writing of “Mrs. Beeton’s Cookery
Book” —for Ellis was a gourmet of the first rank •
he had spent eight years in England and cooked some
3800 “special dishes” in the preparation of that
deathless volume. He was, indeed, a many-sided
man—printer, writer, singer, chef, a fine amateur
actor, a good speaker, a keen but kindly critic, a
bon vivant and a true Bohemian. It is more than
sad that such a man should end his days in destitu-
tion. Too proud to apply for the Old Age Pension,
and too little-known to qualify for anything out of
that farcical scramble, the Commonwealth “Literary
Fund,” Edward Ellis, one of Australia’s best jour-
nalists, and a white man and gentleman, died, after
a career of about 70 years, not a millionaire, not a
big pub-owner, not even a mighty draper, but a
pauper! Go on the press, young man! But don’t
imitate Edward Ellis; cultivate a little selfishness.
BEYOND HER.
“Well, I wouldn't wear that dress — no, not if
she gave it to me!”
“Vic.” gets among the old boomsters:—
Exit Mat Davies, of the Boom. A Geelong native,
he was educated at the local college, under Morrison,
father of the man who has distinguished himself in
China. Getting out of his articles he soon became
a prosperous Melbourne lawyer, backed up with a
Geelong biz, which, drew upon the Western squat-
tages. Then he entered politics, and quickly and, I
think, deservedly progressed .to the Speaker’s chair.
As President he took the leading part in financing
the Y.M.C.A. in its tremendous Bourke-street plunge.
It bought L. L. Smith’s Polytechnic and built the edi-
fice now owned by the Salv’army. Cost, with land,
£55,000, for which the coffers of the Savings Bank
were largely dipped into. That bank also advanced
heavily on Mirams's Federal Coffee Palace. In the
burst there was a danger of a run, through the pub-
lic getting an inkling of these big advances. How-
ever, Premier Patterson and Treasurer Carter gave a
Government guarantee to the bank, and this has held
good ever since. The Y.M.C.A. paid off £29,000 of
its £55,000, and was then in a hole. The Salv’-
army gave the mortgagees £19,500 for the concern
—dirt cheap; it is now worth £30,000. But the
bo °™ I kl, i s at his zenith rather displeased the
y.M.C.A. by financing a troupe of French actors and
actresses, who appeared at the Freemasons’ Hall dur-
J ng J th £u Exhibition of 18S8 - They were a dreadful
frost. Then came the disappearance of the mace from
l arliament House during the high jinks of his rule.
But perhaps Jack Murray could tell that story best.
At this time Davies lived with more splendor than
any other Melbourne citizen of that or anv other
day. His mansion of Bracknell, Toorak, was the
centre of fashion (and theology!)—of sweetness and
light, lilies and languors. Fink’s Grange, Bent’s
Landeox and Munro’s Narbethong were nowhere to
Bracknell. He had just given £IO,OOO to the Im-
perial Institute, in London, when came the ground
crackings of the earthquake. The little boomsters
began to go. Ah, only the little chaps, the sixth
dass!' Davies represented the first class, Bent the
m C °fir;n Mu^ r v° the . third ’ Fink the fourth, Mirams
the fifth. _ The panic went on, and Mirams fell with
his Premier Permanent Building Society. The nine
months imprisonment given to this little man, still

of Farthing: ink. And still those whose withers were
only lau £ h ed, and there was not the faintest

hugged themselves that they were safe. As for Davies
—pooh! He was a rock! Rumor being insolent

He sacked Graham Berrv, the excellent Agent-General
of six years tenure, and had the impudence to go to
London and take the billet himself! But he quickly
returned, smashed, and retired from politics a
trifling land agency. So went class 111. Then Bent
He wenf offT ° r n Ws knees How about Davies?
He went off to Colombo—and was brought back
£2B h o°oo Schedule: Liabilities, £130,000; assets,
£28,000. So much for the half-million! He was
prosecuted but friends saw to it that he was prose-
cuted m the right way. After that he dropped out
and for the past 20 years has quietly pursued his
business, making a large and steady income
The just-dead James Giles, ex-S.M. of
Sydney, was one of 29 men nominated as
10 em i b Sftl °k Council on May
10, 1861, by Charles Cowper in order to
swamp the Council and pass John Robert-
son s Land Bih Old Jack” had resigned
Rn^fh 16 \ . and gone U P t 0 Pilot the
Bill through. Meeting strong opposition, the
Government decided on the “swamp.” The
Council, of 30 members, originally created
tor hve„ years, was on its death-bed. The
rattles were in its throat; it had but
three days to live. To block the Bill. »,. M.
Burton, the President, resigned, and 19
others followed his example. A month later
Tren ] oa membera were appointed, not one
of the 20 was called, though in later years
_x)ui were nominated at various times—
James Byrnes W. B. Dailey, George Oakes
and George Thornton.
Matthew Davies
was gathered to his
fathers the other day,
his immediate father
being Ebenezer who
was the son of the
Kev. John Davies, of
Wales. The snuffle
could be traced in
Matthew and his
brethren. It was as
a bit of a Wowser
that Matthew floated
himself on the crest
of the landboom
wave in Melbourne
years ago. He
was a gaudy copy, in
miniature, of the no-
torious Jabez Bal-
four, _ of Britain,
which is to say that
his financial schem-
ing radiated from
building societies to
banks. He formed
one institution to
feed another institu-
tion, and more insti-
tutions to feed the
food-suppliers, and
so on. And all of
them supplied nutri-
ment to Davies what
time he was pursuing
his career of “public
spirited enterprise,”
“princely generosity”
and confidence trick-
ery. The story of
how all the Davies
companies went in-
evitably bung; and
how his prosecution
was delayed by
Bryan O’Loghlen, the
A t t o rney-General,
(for whom Davies, as Speaker of the Assem-
bly, had started a subscription by putting
100 guineas in the hat) ; of how the
criminal prosecution came to naught when
at last it was brought about, and of how
Davies thereafter hid his land-boom knight-
hood in obscurity, is not worth repeating
nowadays. And how his solid silver-headed
Speaker’s mace was “stolen” from the House
under scandalous circumstances is a story
which can’t be repeated, having been not
yet fully told.
Donald Robertson, who has been taken
from the secretary’s chair in the Maoriland
Postal Department, and made chief of the
newly-created Public Service Board, has
seen a lot of service. Just on 40 years .ago
he started as a cadet in the Dunedin post-
office, and worked his way to the somewhat
pleasurable job of mail-agent for the Loanly
Isles on the Auckland-San Francisco
steamers. From that he was transferred
to the Savings Bank, thence to the Post
and Telegraphs as chief clerk. Then, in
1907, he was made secretarv to that
department, and stayed at that till the larger
luck came his way. The other two com-
missioners are Andrew Thomson, one of the
most popular stipendiary magistrates in
M.L.; and Robert Triggs, who was formerly
driving a modest quill in the M.L. Railway
Department, but latterly has been chief ac-
countant of Australia’s postal department.
A PROHIBITED DISTRICT.
THE SOLD: “Now, you are certain the dog is
not stolen.”
THE SELLER: “Oh, yes, sir! But don't take
him out Double Bay way.”
“Looking Backward’s” footnote:—
Re Michael Massey Robinson (B. 14/11/’l2), de-
scribed as “an accomplished rogue.” Although a
convict, he was, morally speaking, no criminal, and
during his career in Sydney he was one of the most
respectable and popular men of his day. He wasn’t
much of a poet, certainly, but he was our very first
His No. 1 broadside, sold in the streets, was issued in
1810. His were mostly patriotic verses, and very
flattering to George 111. For 10 or 11 years he at-
tended the annual King’s Birthday banquet, and
recited to the gathering an ode written by himself
He died in ’2l, and for years afterwards the guests
at the birthday banquet drank in silence to “the
dead poet laureate.” By this title he was generally
known, and thus was he spoken of in the public press
Old records —they are a trifle obscure—seem to indi-
cate that the pioneer poet attempted suicide with
indifferent success. He cut his throat, but a doctor
came along and cheated Death, though only for a little
while. It is interesting to note, in this connection,
that while in London Robinson lived in the house in
Shoe-lane in which the poet Chatterton committed
suicide. In the Hobakt Town Gazette, of March
23, 1822, there is an announcement that Robinson’s
poems were to be had in book form, but despite the
eager search of collectors, no copy of the volume can
be found.
“SQUOIRE.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wool (branded DR over G, New England)
comes from one of the highest-bred flocks in Aus-
tralia, was very stylish, excellent color and quality,
of moderate length, and excellently prepared. Cap-
tain C. C. Dangar is a son of Mr. A. A. Dangar,
Baroona, Singleton. The squire of Baroona is one
of the most noted stock breeders and wool growers
in Australia, and the standard that he set at Gost-
wyck and the other stations that he owned is evi-
dently being fully maintained by his sons. —Dame
S. M. Herald, with tremendous respect.
“Squoire,” says she. Aye, the old-fashioned way
Be a danged sight better than this yore “Squatter” ;
I ain’t yeered that word for many a day ;
The last I yeer say it was some globe-trotter.
But they harvest hands, whoi, they laughed at he!
“’Ey! there baint no ‘squoire’ in ’Stralia, sonny!”
The lads didn’t loike it a bit, I see.
But what be a man if he’s land and monej r ?
Whoi, he baint no squatter! A pig in the mire,
Now he be a “squatter.” So Oi sticks to “Squoire.”
“ ’Day, Squoire,” says she, and she bobs away
Like a God-fearin’ dame that knows.her betters,
When they pass her by on a market day,
Or drove to the post office for they letters.
A basket of eggs on her arm, maybe,
And a good fat goose for the kitchen fire.
Aye, it’s little enough respect we see
When each wench says “Squatter” for good honest
“Squoire.”
See, old as she is, she can still bend her knee
Like the youngest o’ wenches! “ ’Day, Squoire,”
says she.

Six months ago it was notified here that there was a
pending issue of £500,000 worth of new shares at
par. The transaction is now to be completed, bring-
ing up the capital to £3,500,000. It is a lot of
money, and yet it isn’t too much to thoroughly safe-
guard the various interests. In Australia it is rec-
koned that a bank ought to have £1 of its own for
every £7 of the public’s. In Britain the proportion
of public money is often greater—frequently 10 to
one. But much more of the Australian business is
on land mortgage, and, especially in a country of
droughts, there is more risk in that than in ordinary
transactions with commercial paper. Taking, then,
seven to one as a fair thing in Australia, it will be
found that the Wales has lately overstepped the mark,
on account of the rapid increase of deposits during
the flush years. At present, without the new capital,
its funds are equal to £1 for every £7 14s. of the
public’s. The only thing in question about the new
issue is whether it should have been made at par at
this moment of doubt regarding the future. It
means that the new capital has to get more in divi-
dend than it can possibly earn; hence there will
have to be a drain on the other earnings, with a pro-
bable consequent further shrinkage in the amount
put by. Probably if the issue at par had been de-
cided on three months ago instead of much earlier
m the year, the reserves would have been strengthened
by asking for a premium, and thus the new capital
would have gone nearer paying its own dividend.
There have been no very great changes during the
year:— &

This is another case which shows that the banks
simply had to go slower. There is a popular yarn
about banks tightening up their pockets in order to
make things uncomfortable for the Labor party in
power in the Commonwealth and N. S. Wales. It is
all rubbish. Russell French, the Wales’s general
manager, is a money-lender. It is his business to
sell advances to people just as it is Anthony Hor-
dern s business to sell sugar and socks. And he is
just as keen on doing* it. But he can’t go on making*
advances indefinitely. Hordern’s can go on selling
■ sugar till they haven’t got a grain left on the pre-
mises. Russell French can’t do that. Of every £9
on the premises he is holding nearly £8 on trust;
the whole lot may be called for within two years at
rnost, and £4 or so of it may be called for this
afternoon. Y\ hen money was flowing into him freely
he could safely lend it freely. But this mad bor-
rowing and booming started, engineered in N. S
Wales by some of the worst enemies the Labor party
has ever had; there was a rush for goods of all
sorts; local works couldn’t supply offhand the sudden
and fictitious demand; and the tariff wall wasn’t
high enough to keep foreign goods out. Our own
production didn t increase much (too many of us
being engaged as agents of one sort or another, or
making a bit out of land deals”), so gold had to
be shipped away to pay the bill. And thus the
bank s lending power has been curtailed. As at
September 30, 1909, the Wales owed £27 765 278
to depositors and it had £7,915,306 in coin ’and
bullion. To-day it owes £6,849,521 more to de-
by £205
Or here is another way of looking at it:—

Run the eye down the “Increase of Deposits”
column, and the way it tails off gives you a sick
teeiing. On the other hand, advances were racing

martyr business; it isn’t likely to race ahead hand-

hausted itself. So it still has liquid assets equal to
45 p.c. of its liabilities to the public; and that sug-

assist hard-pushed customers a bit more. And the

It’s an ill boom that blows nobody good. This co
was in the land-subdivision business, and knew a lot
about it. For very many years there was nothing
much for it to do in that way, however, and it pot-
tered along letting a few houses and doing odd jobs
. Then the good seasons and the bad
politicians came, the boom followed, and this co.
remarked, “This is where I come in!” It had a
few remnants of property in hand; and it sold them
at a fine profit. It smelt round and bought other
lands, suburban mostly, and generally seems to have
known how much to give and how much to get. It
paid out a div. of 10 p.c. or so —comparatively
modest in the circumstances—and built up reserves
with the balance. At the same time it called up
more capital in a gentle fashion. Latterly it has
begun to lash out a bit more vigorously. Last year
it transferred £9670 of reserves to capital, making
the £1 shares paid up to 18s. Now it proposes to
transfer another 2s. per share (£9124), which will
make shares fully paid. Of course there is a risk in
the business. You wouldn’t expect to make a profit
of £33,737 on a capital of £83,771 —a good deal
of it provided out of past profits—without taking
some chances. The important question is whether
the risks are all in the past. A co. of this sort can
fall in badly by (1) borrowing heavily; (2) holding
a large quantity of unsold and unproductive rem-
nants ; (3) being let in for unpaid balances, and
having blocks sold on time payment thrown back on
its hands. So far the Intercolonial answers the tests
very well. (1) Its total liabilities are £58,204.'
That is to say, it owes an amount equal to just one-
third of its own funds —a very small liability for a
co. in this kind of business. (2) Its freeholds and
leaseholds are valued in the accounts at only
£48,253; and that no doubt includes the co.’s new-
city office property. “During the year,” the directors
say, “the remaining portions of several estates have
been disposed of, the accounts closed, and the profits
finally adjusted.” That seems to have been the policy
all through—to hold the least possible quantity of
land, and to get rid of one estate before plunging
into another. (3) One can’t say much about this yet.
“Borrowers’ and purchasers’ balances, after deduct-
ing suspense account,” stand at £184,490. That’s
where the money is. Some proportion of this debt
will not be paid, and the securities will be thrown on
the co.’s hands; but there is no guessing how much.
The losses of a co. in this time-payment land busi-
ness depend partly upon the height to which the
boom mounts and partly to the swiftness of the col-
lapse. If the boom peters out gently, instalments
are paid in long enough to put the office on velvet
even if there has to be a foreclosure. This boom is
petering out; it is not exploding with a bang like
the boom of 20 years ago—-chiefly because on this
occasion the banks have kept their heads, have all
through refused big foreign deposits, and, instead of
being in trouble themselves, are still able to give their
customers some assistance. Hence it is reasonable
to expect that this office won’t be very badly hit.
And it is worth noting that it evidently has a sus-
pense account in addition to its reserve funds —no
doubt a contingency fund, consisting more or less
of reserved profits, or, rather, the profit ex-
pected to be made when the time-payment transac-
tion is completed. So it may not have to show any
losses at all, but may go on steadily showing a (no
doubt much reduced) profit.

The fire in the North Lyell broke out on October 12,
so the present accounts don’t show any of the finan-
cial fruits of that disaster. In the previous half-
year there had been a serious strike, so the present
accounts will presently show up like a green hill
between two gritty deserts. Even without these
strike and fire troubles, things at Lyell are not what
they were. This comparison, relating to the metal
values extracted from the Lyell ore, tells part of
the story:—
Copper, p.c. Silver, oz. Gold, oz.
Average since ’O3 0.83 1.95 0.061
Sept., 1910 . . 0.55 2.10 0.042
Sept., 1911 .. 0.55 1.76 0.042
Sept., 1912 .. 0.51 1.86 0.040
But that is only a part. The increase in costs is
very important, too. Five years ago the cost of
producing blister copper was under 14s. sd. per
ton of ore; now it is 20s. OJd. The total quantity
of ore treated in the half-year was 157,296 tons;
and ss. 7d. per ton on that lot means £44,000.
That is to say, on the present output—or, rather, on
the output before the fire threw operations all out
of gear—the half-year’s profits are £44,000 less
than they would have been five years ago, with the
same metal values and prices. But as shown above,
metal values are not the same; only 51 tons of
copper are nowadays got from the quantity Of Mount
Lyell ore which would have yielded 83 tons on the
average since 1903. North Lyell, the other leg on
which the co. stands, has held its own rather better.
Here is a comparison relating to that ore alone:—
Copper, p.c. Silver, oz. Gold, oz.
Average since ’O3 . . 6.07 1.54 0.0046
Half-year’s average .. 5.56 1.13 0.0028
But even that is not a movement the right way.
To meet the altered circumstances the management
decided lately on anew power scheme; and it was
in connection therewith that 100,000 shares were
offered lately to present holders at ss. premium. The
number paid for was 86,739, and the £21,685 of
premium capital realised has been put to the credit
of reserves. Preliminary work in connection with
this Lake Margaret power scheme has been done, and
tenders for the plant close early in Januarv. Besides
this, there is a good deal of plant-remodelling to be
done at the reduction works. The principal thing
the directors had to be sure of was whether the
ore supply justified the outlay ; and they Were ap-
parently left with no doubts on that point. Ex-
clusive of a pyritic body in the South Lyell, there
are, Sticht estimates, 2,361,182 tons in Lyell and
1,083,752 tons in North Lyell; total, 3,444,934 tons.
Take the consumption at slightly over 300,000 tons
a year, and you have then something over 11 years’
supply. The grade also seems pretty right. Conn,

estimated value of the reserves in the two mines—

Naturally the directors want more ore, if they can
get it without paying much for it: hence the pur-
chase of the Comstock, adjoining the North, at a
total cost of £18,177. Its bodies have not been
explored, and only the wildest guess at their size
and value can be made on the strength of one or two
stabs with the diamond drill. “Probable” ore is,
however, set down at 600,000 tons.
Besides the copper mines and works the co. runs
superphosphate mills at Melbourne, Adelaide and
Perth. What profit these works are making the
accounts don’t show; revenue from blister copper
and chemical works is all lumped together. Of last
half-year’s copper 2128 tons were sold at £Bl
2s. lid., 996 tons unsold are taken in at £6O a
ton, and 1172 tons brought forward from the pre-
vious half-year were sold at £lB Os. sd. in advance
of the figure taken credit for in the last accounts.
Approximately the net profit was equal to £36" per
ton on the copper output; which means that, so long
as the co. can work last half-year’s grade at last
half-year’s costs, and so long as it can get the same
proportionate amount of profit (whatever it may
be) out of superphosphates, the co. can make a do
of it with copper down to about £45 per ton.
But to what extent the fire may permanently affect
costs, etc., has yet to be seen.

At the time these accounts were made up there were
250,000. shares of £1 each; but “proposals have
been laid before the shareholders for increasing the
nominal and paid-up capital, and it is hoped the
same will meet with their approval.” The directors
didn’t lose any sleep wondering whether they would
meet with approval or not. , The shareholders have
got quite used to this sort of thing. For many years
the capital was £175,000. Then, as shown above,
£25,000 was capitalised and subsequently £50,000
was called in, though the directors had plenty of
money in hand, as this shows:—

Thus between 1905 and 1912 the surplus of liquid
assets has grown from £15,738 to £178,192. -Cer-
tainly £50,000 of capital has been got in from the
shareholders during the period, but all of that and
more has gone into plant, including steamers. This
means that the profits during the past seven years
have exceeded the dividends by well over £170,000.
Almost that much has been actually laid by in fixed
deposits and public securities, and it is probable that
large sums have also been dropped into plant and
mine development and written off. Yet there was
a time when the co. was only doing very moder-
ately. Then, besides getting hold of good coal, it
got hold of good people, and in consequence it has
now probably the finest bunkering connection in
Australia. It owns a very big area, over 200,000
acres, and there is no doubt more to be had. And a
business of this size calls for a big area: already
the main workings are two miles in from the tunnel
mouth. Partly to meet the changed circumstances
resulting from this burrowing, and partly to im-
prove the bunkering facilities, it is stated that a big
bite is now being taken out of the reserves. But on
past experience they will go ahead again like
"YVnutsisname’s gourd.

This is what is known as a holding ,co. It doesn’t
own a pot of jam itself, and it doesn’t make one.
It merely owns the bulk of the shares in the prin-
cipal Australian concerns which do make jam, etc.
There are Henry Jones and Cos., Ltd., in Tasmania;
and the Australian Jam Cos., Ltd., and others in
Victoria; and the Peacock • people, Ltd., in N. S.
Wales. Each of these has a separate existence con-
fined to one State. Each has, nominally, its own
management. Each produces its own balance-sheet
in accordance with the local Companies Act. But
the public doesn’t see that balance-sheet. The direc-
tors of Henry Jones Co-operative, Ltd., are the man-
agers of the separate concerns. But, you see, there
is no combine. The separate concerns are quite sep-
arate. It simply happens that the same people have
invested in the bulk of the shares of each of them and
control the management.
Now this is by no means necessarily a bad thing.
On the contrary, it may be an exceedingly good
thing, not only for the owners, but for the public
as well. There is an extra-big crop of apricots (say)
in Victoria. There is an extra-big crop of (say) rasp-
berries in Tasmania. With some such organisation
as this in existence the Tasmanian factory keeps
going on raspberries, and supplies not- merely its
own requirements, but those also of its brothers
and sisters, while the Vic. factory goes ahead on
apricots and doesn’t worry about its raspberry sup-
ply. The result is, unquestionably, a better and
purer article; indeed, so far as jam is concerned,
Australia has arrived at just about perfection. There
is no better article in the world. Further, great
expense is saved in distribution. One traveller covers
the ground that formerly knew three or four rivals.
Somebody gains by this stoppage of waste. It may
be the public, it may be the manufacturers. Most
likely it is both. The one thing certain is that no-
body can gain unless the waste is stopped. The thing
is to stop the waste by organising industry, and then
see that the public, gets at least some of the benefits.
The table oh top of these moral observations-
doesn’t even hint that there is any goodwill or paper
among the asset?.. Nominally there isn’t. Really
there is. It is this' way. Jones and Palfreyman 1
(they were the original partners in the original
Jones firm) formed themselves (say) into a co.
Their assets were worth (say) £50,000. The co.
was floated at £BO,OOO. They took 75,000 shares.
That is to say, they took 25,000 shares for the good-
will of the business. Next they sold (say) 74,995
of the shares to the big holding co. at par. The big
co. then simply puts down among its assets- —“In-
vestment in Jam Cos., £74,995.” The goodwill
isn’t shown—it is only shown in the accounts of the
original co. There are lots of other things that are
not shown. The revenue consists entirely of “in-
come from investments.” But the directors make
this remark: “The reports from the cos. in which
your co. is a shareholder, show that... .as usual, full
provision has been made for depreciation of plant
and machinery and all other contingencies.” Whether
that provision is great or small, and whether those
cos.’ dividends absorbed 50 p.c. or the whole 100
p.c. of their profits, nobody can tell who isn’t behind
the scenes ; and one of the objects of this co. would
fail if you got there. The investor has, therefore, to
take a tremendous lot on trust. The assets consist
wholly of shares in cos. about which no information
is even given to the public. That is a matter of
much importance to the person who is not prepared
to take risks with his money—or, at least, visible
risks. If one is prepared to take a few, then he may
safely conclude that for the present this is a highly
profitable business; and The Bulletin sees no
reason why it shouldn’t continue so, if it behaves
itself.
The co. has established a factory in S’Africa, and
expects to. do pretty well out of it. This is another ad-
vantage of the organising of the industry. It has the
means to promote an export trade and open up chan-
nels for the outlet of surplus fruit and fruit pro-
ducts—and that is going to be an enormously im-
portant matter for the fruit-grower presently. Ex-
tensions of business have called for more capital lately.
The total issued stands now at £550,000. The
amount paid (practically all in shares) for the’busi-
nesses originally taken over was £400,000, whereas
(harking back to something said above) the tangible
assets were valued at the time at £308,328. That
- meant £91,328 of paper assets to start with, and no
doubt some have been added since; but it is quite

r lhe investment market has been very much troubled
about this co. and its stock. In the middle of last
year shares were worth 28s. They are 1 How quoted
at about 15s. The co. dashed into the time-payment
piano business and as >at March, 1912, sh “red
fpre=r agreements under contract (less unearned in-
terest and insurance), £122,487.” At that time
the paid capital was £132,485. The investment
market evidently didn’t like it; and the uneasy feeb
known aS that te tlf fle rr W i 6n ’ the ot^er day ’ jt became
known that the directors were not going to pay a
dividend, considering that, in view of the existing
stringency of the money market and the present
financial outlook, the resources should be as far as
possible conserved. That hire-agreement asset bein°-
m doubt, the, auditors (Yarwood, Vane and Cos)
were asked for a special report on it. The auditors
replied m effect (1) a deposit has been paid in
each case, and instalments extend over not more
than four years, except m 5 p.c. of the cases, where
extensions have been granted or taken ; (2) the total
of arrears is under 6 p.c. and “not at all excessive”
•i v.i a .percentage of forfeitures is, of course in-
evitable,. but those suffering have ’been dealt with
promptly, losses on re-sale have not been great and
have been easily borne by the profits:” ’And
unsoid returned instruments are valued at cost or
under. This is quite satisfactory as far as it goes
but it doesn’t go to the end. A piano is landed

To reduce its risks the co. has lately made its hire-

“The Oldest Inhabitant” resurrects a
long-forgotten N.S.W. provincial bank: —In 1835
Sydney had four banks of issue, the New South, the
Commercial, the Australia, and the Australasia, and
the town of Bathurst had one. This Bathurst bank
had ,a capital at first of £10,000; also, it had a
president and five directors. Mr. A. K. MacKenzie,
of Dockavine, who had had banking experience in
England, was the president. The original banking
house was the old Commissariat store. To obtain
specie from Sydney various ruses were adopted;
papkages of table salt, millinery and casks of corn
•carried in their innards gold, silver, copper and
notes. The bank prospered, and good dividends were
paid. The Union Bank presently sent up an agent,
who bought over the business at a price which gave
the shareholders their money back, and almost cent,
per cent, profit. Mr. William Lee, founder of the
Lee family, built premises on the corner of Howick
and; William streets for the institution when it out-
grew its 1 first home. These premises were in after
years known as The Duke’s, a public house kept by
Mr. Turner, grandfather of the cricketer. When
the Union took over the business it paid all' the
notes of the old bank as they came in, for a
time; ■ then an enterprising townsman undertook for
a lump sum to pay the rest. He had cause to regret
his bargain; as for years the notes dribbled in upon
him. Several; years after he thought all claims had
been pret,, a .£lO note reached him. He declined to
pay, pleading the lapse of time; but finding that no
limit ha,d been fixed, he handed over his 10 beauti-
ful sovereigns. To the day of his death he was
haunted with visions of spectral notes coming upon
him. The Bathurst bank had sold out just in time
to save its shareholders, for such a drought followed
that scarcely a local financial institution was able to
stand the strain.

Considering that the mine is away up in a remote
part of Siam, the accounts, etc., are presented most
expeditiously. The tin oxide produced by the co.
(whose record is practically covered by the table)
has been 3775 tons, which has realised £376,580.
Out of this £112,500 has been paid in divs.,. equal
to 75 p.c. of the capital. But the future is just as
uncertain as it always has been. In most dredging
propositions the area is bored, and you can tell
beforehand almost exactly what you are going to
get. This co. works a harbor bottom, which, so far
as 'this paper knows, has never been bored —it has
been merely prospected. This year, as in past years,
no bore-hole plans are given—for the good reason, no
doubt, that there are none. Bluck, the general
manager, says: “I see no reason to alter my pre-
viously expressed opinion as to the value of your
concession. It is true that the average value per
yard is slightly lower,” etc., and he recommends
that two more hig dredges should be built. But no
sane person can be satisfied with Bluck’s mere
opinion; one wants to know what Bluck bases his
opinion on. Even Bluck, though a good man, isn’t
omniscient. His N.S.W. shovel-dredging co., in the
Araluen district, was a ghastly failure.

This year South Broken Hill pays a record
295. per share in dividends (£290,000). The tall
markets for lead and spelter, coupled with the big
sales of zinc product, some of it old, are responsible
for the glitter. But this is. nothing like a record for
Broken Hill. The B. H. Prop, in 1890 paid 225. per
share (£1,056,000), followed by 245. per share in
1891 ( £1.152,000). Mount Morgan (Q.) paid
£1,106,000 in 1889 ; but there are many who look
back at the consequent Mount Morgan boom with
sorrow. And this Broken Hill spurt may be loaded.
At any rate keep in mind three things: (1) The lead
and spelter markets have been abnormal, and the
spelter market in particular has simply been propped
up .by a ring, which has kept hundreds of thousands
of tons out of consumption; (2) the old zinc tail-
ings dumps, which are yielding the South and othprs
a heap of profit, can only be handled once ; (3) costs
have climbed higher and higher, and they won’t
come down as readily as they have gone up.
The N.S.W. Mines and Smelting Cos.,
contrary to its own sanguine expectations, though
not those, of The. Bulletin (vide B. 22/2/’ll), is in
process of reconstruction. According to a daily
papfer, “the proposition is considered a good one” —-
doubtless by the same person or persons responsible
for the following facts about the mine at Breadal-
bane: Iron ore in sight=4,ooo,ooo tons (to be spelled
slowly) of 50 to 60 p.c. iron, with copper contents ;
the western lode averages 60ft., and at 240 ft. depth
is 1.20 ft. wide at least; a yield of 15s. per ton =
handsome profit. Finally, there is the 100-ton-a
day smelter, and behind that the customs smelting
idea. . “Arrangements have been made for more
•economical working.” Now, what are those arrange-
ments, and do they guarantee economy enough?
Without that, the millions of tons of ore may be
utterly disregarded.
, * * * *
The infant lodide (N.S.W.), not yet out
<of its swaddling-clothes (though one wouldn’t think
so from the dimensions of its capital), has already
been called upon to fight for its existence, or part
of it, anyway. Its claim to M.L. No. 3, a birthright
established by the Warden last May, was rudely
pounced upon, but the intruder was beaten back
with a nasty bundle of costs. The young co. is now
free to prove whether there is anything in the lease
worth scrapping over.
The Lake View and Oroya combination
wound up its first year with a profit of
A 5 p.c P div. chipped £18,047 off this surplus, leav-
ing £3578 to carry forward. This year s
is expected to be 10 p.c. The report mentions that
on the formation of the co. £ni,799 m 349,0au
10s shares, was passed on to the old Lake Consols
as purchase consideration, the assets being apportioned
as follows: Property account (shares, debcntures etcO,
£168.110; cash (balance in hand after liquidation
of the old co.’s debts), £6689. The purchase con-
sideration issued to holders of Oroya Exploration
scrip amounted to £186,151, in 3/2,303 *
shares, apportioned as follows: Property
(shares, debentures, mining properties, _ etc.),
£176,715; cash (balance in hand afler liquidation
of old co.’s debts), £9436. During the past year the
property account has been debited with expenditure
on shows, together with the cost of additional
interests acquired. From the report of T. Hoove ,
who recently inspected the co. s various interests, it
appears that the last half-yearly revolution in
Nicaragua has plaved the deuce with things. at the
Oroya Leonesa, and consequently the co. running this
shoW has had to be given financial assistance. Re-
ports agree that reserves amount to 94,358 tons ol
395. 7d. ore, and that about 1800 ft. of 435. to 445.
ore has been driven on, and 4jft. of 1 0s. ore exposed
in a crosscut deeper down. The Babiloma (Nicar-
agua) is in the same plight as the Leonesa. Hoover
has every reason to believe that the reserves of
47 242 tons of 445. ore figured on are accurate. At
the Queen of the Hills (W.A.) crushing starts in
February, when a profit of £3600 a month is
expected. At the Mountain Queen (W.A.) develop-
ments are encouraging. A much larger tonnage
than was estimated is exposed in the upper work-
ings, and a greater length of payable ore has been
exposed at the No. 1 level than was thought to
exist. Profits of £2OOO a month are anticipated
shortly. As to Youanmi and Oroya Black Range
(WA.), profits from these two mines have so tar
averaged £7OOO a month. The bank overdraft was
paid off in June, and since then profits have been
accumulating, so that the dividend stage cannot now
be far off. Pay shoots in the bottom workings of the
Youanmi have so far proved shorter than up above,
and the irregularity in their occurrence is causing
the management some anxiety. The discovery, of
“extensions” in the Oroya Black Range has given it
a much longer lease of 1 fe than was anticipated
when the amalgamation with the Youanmi was fixed
up - * * * *
Whim Well (W.A.) announces that its
Murex magnetic plant is working _ all right, and
returns should be given a leg-up right away. lhe
shipment of 863 tons (part of a consignment of
2200 tons) of Hi p.c. ore is also reported.
Mav*Queen Reward (W.A.) has increased
its capital to £30,000 by the creation of 30,000
new 10s. shares. The show is a very doubtful ven-
ture. If quotes are. genuine, their market valua-
tion is ridiculously high.
* * *
On November 8, at Sandstone (W.A.), a
meeting of Sandstone shareholders confirmed the sale
of the property and effects to the Yuanmi Cos. for
£4OOO Manager Whitfeld stated from the chair
that the directors could not recommend shareholders
to spend any more money on the show, and neither
could he: and that being so, the best thing to do
was to get rid of it. He defended the disposal of
the mine and plant for £4OOO, when the plant
alone was valued at £9BOO in March last, by stating
that the value of a plant depended on the work it
would probably do when erected, a large portion ol
the value being in the foundations and cost of erec-
tion. The value of a plant, therefore,_ depended on
the ore reserves; but in order to avoid continually
re-valuing the plant with the fluctuation of the ore
reserves, it was usual to allow for a heavy deprecia-
tion. In their case they allowed for a depreciation
of 20 p.c. per annum, but even that was found to be
insufficient, owing to the rapid decline in the value
of the reef. One or two local shareholders protested
against the sale, but the weight of numbers and
proxies forced it through.
The now-little-heard-of Central Boulder
(W.A.) is credited by the local paper with anew
shoot dipping south into Lake View Consols; 100
tons, extracted from a depth of 30ft., has just averaged
24dwt. over the plates, and a lot of similar grade
ore is alleged to be in sight. Tributors have the
right to whatever gold they can get, less royalty,
until November next year; but their workings are
limited to a depth of 70ft. A lot of gold has been
extracted from this lease in the past; but, although
tribute parties have done well at times, shareholders
have never received anything. In all probability
they never will.
* * * *
Generally speaking, Paynes’ Find (W.A.)
has almost realised the estimates of prospectors in
shallow ground. Sweet William Cos. has three blocks
on this field, though only one is being worked ; 100
tons from it were recently treated at the neighboring
State mill for a 30dwt. return. Between 300 and
400 tons, estimated to average an ounce, are now
awaiting treatment. The manager reports that since
the show was acquired by the co. it has been worked
to a depth of only 30ft. and for a length of 80ft., and
has produced £2430. Its permanency, however, is
yet to be proved.
* * * *
Apparently Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) has
been doing things it can’t afford. At the beginning
of the year it stood behind £94,0Q0, or thereabouts.
Since then it has paid away £58,093 in dividend
and dividend duty, expended (to October 30) £14,246
on capital account, and is reported to .have written
off an estimated Porcupine loss of £25,000. This
makes a total debit for the 10 months of £97,339.
Against this there is a gross profit of £51,275, so
the outgoings have exceeded income by £46,064.
And another dividend, absorbing with taxes £17,875,
has been declared payable on December 19. It is
time the co. took a pull:
* * * *
Commodore’s (W.A.) existence is alleged
to have been materially prolonged by the opening up
of a second lode “for a very long distance.” Last
month’s run showed a gross profit of £465, while
510 tons of 16s. slimes were added to the surface
pile of 5000 tons. Some optimists speak of the mine
being able to pay dividends by-and-bye. But appear-
ances are against the show ever returning much, if
any, of the capital put into it.
* * * *
The manager’s annual report does not give
much ground for hope in regard to the future of
Kalgurli (W.A.). Some fair-sized patches of good
values have been disclosed at two or three points in
the bottom levels, but in most other places the blocks
of pay ore are very much on the small side. From
the main south drive, at 1850 ft., 13 bore holes were
put out horizontally east and west. The easterly holes
were all in barren country. One of the westerly
punches furnished low-grade ore over a considerable
width, 7Oft. from starting point; and another indi-
cated 3ft. of 13dwt. ore at 110 ft. from the drive.
Crosscuts are now being driven to test these bodies.
* * * *
Binti Bind (W.A.), about whose riches
the local and Adelaide papers raved a month or two
ago, is deserted. Scarcity of water is given as the
reason, but the failure of the boomsters to get the'
public in has had something to do with it. Unless
the State sinks a shaft and gets water before the
New Year, the desertion of scores of leases, on which
£10 10s. rent and survey fees have been paid, is
threatened. The best lease is held under option by
an Adelaide syndicate, which claims to have a mine,
or something resembling one.

Mount Morgan closed its half-year last
week. When the report is issued it should contain
many inspiriting features, and be more than ordin-
arily interesting. The total cost of producing cop-
per should emerge in its nakedness, as the closing of
the mundie works has deprived the copper depart-
ment of that sheltering cloak. The way the revenue
accounts were presented made it impossible to ac-
curately segregate the two classes of ore; but, even
so, it was sufficiently discernible that the Mount
Morgan copper costs compared more than unfavor-
ably with those of any other decent-sized producer
in the Commonwealth. Only wealth of gold pulled the
co. out of the bog. Indications are that the new
costs will show a substantial reduction, not because
of any improved methods in particular, but by the
closing up of several gaping chasms of extravagance.
Reduced mining and power costs are the two chief
factors which, together with the soaring of copper,
should produce a thumning profit—-unless chairman
Casey’s remarks at the last half-yearly meeting
were hopelessly “out” when he referred to the small
influence the mundie works exercised upon the profits.
Mine developments at the S.W. corner of the Mount
are well worth watching; they may lead to big
things. Altogether affairs are healthier now than for
many a day.
Prince Alfred (N.Q.) is putting another
lot of its 13 p.c. tin stuff into the Gurrumbah bat-
tery. The last concentrates (2t>j tons from 204 tons
of ore) brought £153 10s. per ton, which is said to
be a record price in N.Q. For the whole parcel the
co. got £4205, or £20 10s. per ton of ore; and
the only expenses after the stuff had been got to the
surface were 22s. 6d. for carting and 20s. for crush-
ing. The crushing now going in should be through
in time to give the co. a Christmas box. Work is
confined to stoping over the 90ft. level, though the
lode is strong underfoot. What there may be below
90ft. nobody knows; but Prince Alfred has been a
gentleman so far. It looks as though the entire capi-
tal ( £10,000) will be paid back in divs. within 12
months of the starting of work.

Brilliant Block, Charters Towers, is ex-
pected to reconstruct very shortly, or throw in its lot
with Brilliant Deeps. Boring with the drill has not
so far proved any reef. The Brilliant Deeps is a
block claim on the Brilliant Block, but the footwall
reef appears to become smaller and more lightly-
mineralised rising up towards the Brilliant Blocks
boundary. The end of No. 4 level is, however, so
close to the boundary that the reef is practically
certain to pass into the Brilliant Blocks. The latter
has a battery, and could, if provided with more
capital, continue the sink for the Brilliant Deeps reef.
The other objective is the Day Dawn, and sinking
on the formation known by that name is to be
continued below 2000ft. The last call has been
made, and contributing shares now rank equal to
paid-ups.
Developments at Mount Oxide (Q.) are
quite satisfactory; but the old financial troubles
haven’t been overcome. The co. can’t have many
more shots left in the locker ; and the mine needs a
good many shots. No doubt it could pull through in
a small way, without more capital, just like Henry
pulled through before the co. appeared on the scene;
but it is simply wasting the substance of the mine,
and throwing away an unusual chance.

From Charters Towers: Every few weeks
an old stager is wound up and placed, lock, stock
and barrel, under the hammer as a “going con-
cern,” and slaughtered at about the value of the iron
sheds covering the plant. Some little time back the
Brilliant North, which cost the gullible Cockney a
stack of money, was knocked down at £350. Within
a week, boilers, etc., worth the whole amount, were
taken to the Deeps, and the balance, consisting of
the mine, is held for future use —possibly as Brilliant
Deeps East, or whatever is most fashionable at the
time. About three months ago the Queen Deeps,
which has bled the public under various names for 30
years, was bought at £320. The book value of the
plant and machinery alone was many thousands.
Later on Wallis’s Day Dawn was knocked down at
£51, while a cabload of people stood round, ap-
parently to scare away “miner blokes” who under
ordinary circumstances would have given three times
as much for the galvanised covering of the shed. The
same people, or their friends, do practically all the
buying.

Gullock, of the North Nuggetty, Dayles-
ford (Vic.), denies the yarn that he intends to
resign in favor of a man from the Alps; but the
story persists that changes are about. He has been
buttering the North Nuggetty’s toast at least as
well as Chairman Rain expected ; and the talk now is
of a Christmas box of a shilling in addition to the
usual divvy. It would be real cruelty under all the
circumstances to lose Gullock, especially as a big
wad of scrip lies heavily on the chest of the “bull”
crowd, and the shoot of gold that of late showed
up unexpectedly isn’t going to be much help to
them.
* * » *
Berringa (Vic.) has been more cheerful
ever since Williams’ Fancy got its shoot of stone at
No. 6. There the 310ft. of payable stone, lift, wide,
is the nicest development seen on a field for the
past two years. Such dirt, going 5dwt., will mean
not only a Christmas dinner, but black coffee and
a liqueur to follow. Still, there’s an end to the
good thing, for the drive has run into the same big
break that made things awkward at No. 4. Another
fault has to be looked for 30ft. ahead, and where
the Williams’ Fancy wants luck is to get decent
gold beyond these breaks.
* * * *
Owing to the delay of the London crowd
in taking hold of Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado (Vic.),
it looks as if Victoria will have to do the needful.
What the co. needs is three big dredges instead of
one. A man of the Cecil Ryan type is the sort to
run the rule over the show, for his work in the
lead at the Pioneer (Tas.) qualifies him to build up
just such a scheme as Cock’s wants. Smith, of Wan-
garatta, and North Lyell Lonergan’s trustees are the
two biggest shareholders, with perhaps Hector Mac-
donald a close-up third. Macdonald is still tootling
Cock’s Pioneer to Cohen in London. Seeing that
shareholders aren’t a hard-up lot, why don’t they
wipe all idea of Cohen out of their mind, tighten up
their waistbands and work the show for Australians?
It’s too good to let go.
Bendigo is out with a bigger count-up of
colors of gold than usual. ». -°at Northern, which
seemed as stale as Deakin’s a. ti-Referenda patter,
owns up to two or three specks in the reef above
. 1200ft., and in the upper ground it now and then gets
a dab of payable stone. United Hustlers also is
peeping out from the clouds, gold having been got
north in the intermediate below 365ft. But all
these goodly signs are now shaded off by the walk-
ing ticket given by secretary Little of the A.M.A.
to the non-unionists at the New Moon and the Red,
White and Blue Cons. A question of politics is mixed
up in the row, for the two men objected to couldn’t
sw'allow the change of A.M.A. from a non-political
to a political organisation. There is the making of
a Donnybrook fight over the issue. This is because
there is still an element in the A.M.A. which isn’t
too keen on the progressive ideals of the Little
party. ■ So with the elements of a big strike in the
pot, more than a color or two of gold are needed
at the moment to keep investors loyal to Bendigo.

“Side On” : Re gold nuggets (B. 17/10/T2).
According to Victorian Geologist Dunn, “The Dunolly”
weighed 2844oz. The record in the Melbourne
Museum gives the weight as 23020 z- “Massi'na’s Alma-
nac” makes it 22690 z. And the monument erected
on the spot where the nugget was discovered says
23160 z. As this is not a question relating to some-
thing in the Pentateuch, surely someone can come
to my rescue and tell me what’s what.

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf

catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, December 2, 1912.
My Dear Arini.—
The recent feverish rush of bazaars and
foundation-stones is flinging final limelight
round Governor Chelmsford and his wife.
On Saturday the lady opened a sale of
patients’ work in the beautiful grounds of
the Home for Incurables at Ryde. The
invitation card from the Home gave the
Governor’s lady the erroneous label of “Her
Excellency.” This has become a habit dur-
ing the present regime at State Government
House. Only three women in “the over-
seas” can wring this title from the British
Blue 800k —the wives of the Viceroy of India
and of the Governors-General of Canada and
Australia. Lord Plunket introduced his
wife as “Her Excellency” to an astounded
public which was breathing sulphur for the
good of its health, in Rotorua (M.L.), a
few years ago, and since then every little
State court has had an Excellency of each
sex always on hand. Perhaps Lady Ede-
line Strickland will officially forbid the use
of a title to which she has no right.
The meeting which rallied round the Twi-
light House League last week had its back
hair nearly blown off its head by a 20-h.p.
electric fan; the thing buzzed in the chief
municipal lady’s official nest like a colony
of infuriated bees, scattering sneezes and
stiff necks. The Town Hall quarters of a
Sydney Mayoress look as if they had been
built for the suppression of air; yet the
desperate remedy of introducing a cyclone
to the eardrums of inhabitants of back seats
wants to be used with discretion. The tact-
ful aide-de-Mayoress, W. Layton, might in-
quire into the habits of the electrical whirl-
wind.
Concerning the Twilight House, suggested
as a cure for the cheap-and-nasty “apart-
ments vacant ” into which the educated
woman worker descends when she gets into
the trough of life, Miss Rose Scott was brief
and to the point. She pointed out that the
rough estimate of working expenses would
have to be severely revised. Rent £lOO and
Food £l5O per annum were quite below the
mark in view of the present high prices of
those necessary evils. Mrs. Walker (North
Sydney’s Mayoress) presented the meeting
with some practical ideas. The amiable
platitudes shed by Mrs. R. Mackinnon under
the shade of a handsome hat, meandered off
to the gardening habits of a dear and aged
aunt; and a little bit of earth to spade up was
suggested as a help to declining years. But
all these things were merely mentioned. The
meeting got no farther than the appointment
of a committee to forward the movement, and
the garden patch as a substitute for the
dusty pot-plant on the sooty window-sill of
the average “Room to Let” abode is still
some distance away.
Prof. David, as chairman at Mary Proc-
tor’s lecture in St. James’s Hall, stole some
of the visitor’s thunder in an informative
preliminary address. She had plenty to go
on with, however. “Other Worlds than
Ours” was the subject. The wan, wrinkled
face of the dead moon, the chances of the
lady star Venus having week-end bungalows
and other signs of civilisation tucked away
under her golden pinafore, and the canals
(?) in Mars were topics that made even
skyscrapers seem very small tricks. The
Galaxy, or silver river of Heaven, as photo-
graphed, may be the address of the original
David and the celestial choir, for all Mary
knows to the contrary. At the finish, when
the stars had gone to bed in their lantern-
slide box, a lady jumped up in the back of
the hall, and vociferously called for a vote
of thanks to the lecturer. Yet some of our
sex assert that nothing but the pinpricks
that stab their suffering country’s large
estates would ever goad them on to public
speaking.
In a recent lecture to a Girls’ Club Mrs.
David handed out hints to help women to
open their mouths in public. The art of not
biting off the end of a sentence, or writhing
throughout the chairman’s opening address,
was also emphasised. To do your whole
duty at a public meeting you must, it ap-
pears, be at once an orator, a perfect lady,
and a student of English classics, and you
must not hit the middle of an argument
when you ought to be gracefully retiring on
its final clause or sitting firmly on its tail.
But it seems to me that some other sort of
hints are needed far worse. The gift of
Silence is a jewel which platform women
are burying under tons of verbiage; and a
prophetess who will rise up and politely re-
quest the eternal public speaker to hold his
or her peace for five minutes will deserve a
very cordial welcome.
There seems to be nothing in science to
prevent a woman changing her mind at the
last moment. Hence Mary Proctor, who
pursues the stars, revoked her decision to
leave for India on Saturday by the Mon-
golia. In response to a pressing invitation
to visit Maoriland, the lady blushed and said
“Yes” at the 19th hour.
The Innes dame, who is Mrs. Biard
d’Aunet, is staying in this town. Her first
husband was the much esteemed Justice
George Innes, of local note. The lady’s
second bite at the matrimonial cherry was
the sour-looking diplomat who filled the
chair of French Consul in this town. She
is renting the house usually occupied by
Mildred and Marcia Lamb; those two
healthy-looking Australians skip off to
Europe.
Nearly three years have fallen into the
limbo of the past since Marie Narelle’s
younger daughter won the Emmeline Woolley
music scholarship. Aspirants for the next
helping of that juicy joint will please take
note. The cash is about £4B per annum for
three years, and entitles the holder to alter-
nate snacks of study in the Royal Academy
and Royal College of Music (London). Stu-
dents must be under 21 and feminine. No
musical boy of 60 summers or less has a hope
of winning this scholarship.
Miss Thomas, who hails from Wales, is
sampling the Australian horse up Cooma
way. She is staying on the Lang homestead
in those woolly parts. The Welsh visitor
is a sister of the charming little Mrs. Alex.
Cordon, who used to be the sweet singer,
Margaret Thomas.
Young Lieut.. Playfair, a son of Sydney’s
meat magnate, is to marry the daughter of
George Reid in June. The wedding is billed
to take place in this city.
Miss Enid Lindeman, a tall, fair beauty
who is the daughter of the Cawarra vine-
yard Lindemans, is engaged to Roderick
Macleod Cameron. He is the head of a well-
known firm, Cameron and Co., which has its
chief counting-house in New York and
agencies throughout Australia. The father
of this Roderick was the late knight Rod-
erick, who represented England at the Cana-
dian Exhibition years ago. Cameron, jun.,
who hovers on the sunny side of 40, is said
to be one of the best. It was the girl’s
grandfather, the late Dr. Lindeman, who,
breaking away from the stethoscope, took
land on the Paterson, and started the suc-
cessful Cawarra wine business.
Denis Garvan and his bride (who was
Dorothy Owen a few weeks ago) are going
to leave on a pilgrimage through the British
Isles and thereabouts in a moon or two.
And so are the grape-growing Cawarra Lin-
demans.
The death of Miss Burdett Smith removes
a gentle, melancholy figure that sometimes
flitted across the mild festivity of a local
Garden party. She was a sister of the late
iurdett Smith first, last, and all the
time. She mourned his death, now com-
paratively ancient history, with the grief of
a devotee at the shrine of a dead idol.
Garbed in raven black, she was always men-
tioned on her occasional appearances in the
social round as “the sister of the late Bur-
dett Smith.” Unlike some weepful members
of our sex, this Lady of Tears had been as
devoted to her brother in his life as she was
to his memory after his decease. Circum-
stances had never forced her to swallow her
breakfast in haste, clutch her tram-fare and
bustle off in search of a wage. Steady work
is a fine remedy for that old feminine orgy
of grief so popular with the heroines of Jane
Austen’s novels, who could always thor-
oughly enjoy the luxury of “a good cry.”
Burdett Smith, better known as “Cupid,”
was secretary to the Captain Cook statue
committee. When the work was done the
busy Cupid was presented with a silver
statuette —a model of the Cook effigy in
Hyde Park. This the sister who passed
away on Sunday gave to the Mitchell
Library when the latter was officially opened.
Mrs. Yaughan, who used to be Mrs. Pren-
dergast of these parts, is coming this way
from England sometime early in 1913. As
a woman of fashion and a religious devotee,
she balanced the world, the flesh and the
prayer book with a sincerity that made
ordinary gadabouts gasp with admiration.
One of the handsome Fitzgeralds of Mel-
bourne, she was a sister of the late Mrs.
Gordon. In her widowhood she bestowed her
fascinating personality on one of the numer-
ous English Vaughan family, which once
contributed a Roman Catholic Archbishop
to Sydney.
Only an electrician, or a man of science,
or a combination of mechanist and student,
can hope to grapple with the complications
of color-music. If Prof. Remington, whose
name carries weight in England, hadn’t been
stumbling over the same hurdles, while a
local business man, A. B. Hector, was em-
ploying his leisure hours in pursuit of the
colored-chord hobby, the latter would have
been laughed to scorn by every little doubt-
ing Tom in the community. As it is, the
local man has been heartily d —d with faint
praise. Yet Hector is obviously on the
threshold of an important scientific fact. It
appears, certainly, to be of no commercial
value; it doesn’t promise to lead to anything
you can sell by the pound or tie up with a
coupon and a pound of tea. Indirectly, how-
ever, the relation between sound and color
may blaze the path of discovery to many
other phenomena. Hector’s paraphernalia
for demonstrating his invention, or research
work, is at present probably as crude as the
first bird-man’s notion of a flying machine.
As time goes on, in spite of tons of cold
water that will be poured into his scientific
struggles, he will possibly perfect and sim-
plify the unhandy affair he uses to-day.
Paling’s concert room was full of raging
curiosity bottled up in sac suits and under
female millinery, the other afternoon, as a
few score of more or less interested citizens
craned their necks to see such things as pale-
blue chords shot with amethyst and pearl.
The lights went out as Mr. Chandler groped
for the keys of the organ. Then someone
kindly assisted by turning on a discreet
gleam of candle-light to show the organist
where he was putting his hands and feet.
All the colors of the rainbow flashed in swift
response to the music. It happened to be
Handel’s “Largo,” and one felt that Handel’s
ghost ought to have walked the floor to see
his own composition. After loud applause
and incidental attacks of sudden darkness,
Miss Rae sang Gounod’s “Ave Maria” ; and
again the mystic colors danced amongst the
little paper petticoats that shrined the elec-
tric bulbs. A. B. Hector is not yet in full
possession, I imagine, of all the secret fast-
nesses of color-music. But he is bursting
open the front door, and peering at the won-
ders within with original and remarkable
results.
The Grey-Egertons, with Tier daughter
Clarke and his daughter Egerton, were
booked to depart in the Mongolia.
As hinted in this letter a few weeks ago,
the M.L. Baronet Ward family are on the
wing for the Thames Embankment. They’re
so often in London these days that as time
goes on they’re liable to turn into naturalised
Cockneys, without a vote in M.L.
The Philip Mortons were staying in
Hampshire with one of the moneyed Coopers
when the last mail left London.
The tall and good-looking Mrs. McCor-
mick, wife of Sydney’s best-known surgeon,
returned the other week from a long trip to
Europe.
That wonderful old lady, Mrs. George
Rankin, dared the slippery cocoanut matting
and the six-inch stairs that wind up to the
Society of Artists’ show. She was more
brisk on its torrid opening day than other
youngsters half her years. Mrs. Rankin is
the original, by the way, of Bernice Edwell’s
miniature, “The Eriend of Everywoman,” re-
cently hung at the Women Painters’ show,
and bought by the Women’s Club.
“ILK.” sends me this from Ireland :
The domestic-servant problem in Australia cannot,
after all, be due, like the recent taste of drought, to
the baneful Labor Government. Here, where there
isn’t any Labor Government, I visited a small town
where the peasant women and children still wear
shawls on their heads instead of hats, and where the
thatched cottage, guiltless of ventilation, still shelters
men, women, children, fowls, pigs, dogs and cats in-
discriminately. The town contains over 2000 inhabi-
tants, without counting the fowls, pigs, dogs and
cats, yet it has no newspaper, and is 17 miles from
a railway station. But, in spite of its primitive and
Arcadian condition, it can boast its servant problem,
and the mistress is under the large heel of her hand-
maiden.
At a farm house where I was visiting one after-
noon the rosy-cheeked Molly came into the sitting-
room about four o’clock, and said, “I’ll be after
milking the cows now.” “But it is much too early
yet, Molly,” mildly expostulated the lady. “Well,
ye’ll be after milking them yourself, Ma’am; I’m
going to the dance this evening.” An hour later
Molly, decked in her Sunday gown and hat, wheeled
past the house on her bicycle.
During the drive home to my hotel a few hours
later, I came across the sequel. Under the spreading
horse-chestnut trees, at the cross roads, were six or
seven young couples wildly gyrating to the sounds of
a melancholy melodeon, which was played by a cheer-
ful-looking individual at a few pence per hour. A
couple of lanterns, hung from the trees, shed light on
the “ballroom,” and on closer view I saw that under-
neath was a boarded floor about SOft. x 20ft. My
driver explained that the floor was movable, and
could be carried away in wet weather, or when an-
other site was fancied. He told me that similar ball-
rooms were scattered all round the country-side at
the cross-roads for the convenience of domestic ser-
vants and farm hands. This form of entertainment,
I learned later, was provided by the Anti-Immigration
Leagues of Ireland to make the young folk content
in the Motherland, and to combat the appalling ten-
dency of young Ireland to meander off to Canada
and Australia.
I tentatively mentioned to a man at the hotel that
the Australian Governments at the present time
were offering great inducements to domestic servants,
and asked him how he thought an emissary of the
Immigration Department would be received in those
parts. “With the same implement that the landlord
used to be welcomed with,” he answered grimly.
The sorrow of not hiring a footman for
half a day gave some Australians recently
abroad about two miles pedestrian exercise
after a Royal garden party. Shaking the
salt of the earth off their shoe leather, the
Sydneysiders set forth from the presence of
George to find their hired car. Then they
began to understand things. Right ahead,
on every side, was a gorgeous procession of
Calves, rented by the year or hour, as the
circumstances of their employers permitted.
It was the business of each Jeames to take
a pilgrimage in search of the chariot of “his
people.” No shouting of numbers or yell-
ing for the Duchess of Bluemouldy’s car
desecrated the evening air. When the Aus-
tralian pair, who hadn’t been warned of the
necessity of leasing Calves for their after-
noon jaunt to Windsor, had tramped two
miles, they discovered the tyres that were to
trundle them to their tavern. They brought
back to Sydney a firm conviction that
Jeames is still a bulwark of the Empire.
A National Rose Society is one of the
latest departures in horticultural circles.
Already it is rather more than a suggestion,
with power to grow. Dr. C. Hall presided
at the arguments in favor of same at *
meeting in the School of Arts. ’ at a

Macdonald occurred in the Town Hall on
Saturday night. An enthusiastic commit-
tee gathered itself together on a few leather
front, and contemplated a fairly

The audience was out for encores, and made
a determined effort to double the programme
from the first item—Rubinstein’s Etude op.

youthful singer, Daisy Sweet, was over-
weighted by the Page’s Song from Gounod’s

tage in the ballad that followed.

ald a gold watch as a memento of his

than it had twelve months ago. Probably he
might shut up his voice-box with advantage
and give it two or three months’ rest-cure’
The youthful songbird, Leah Myers, also
needs to pull herself up with a sharp remin-
der that she is still a student. Careless
enunciation and other blemishes are creep-
ing into her concert style. The loud ap-
plause of admiring friends won’t help any
youngster to carve a way to a successful
career.
St. Brigid’s Orphanage, Ryde, is contem-
plating its annual Christmas treat to the
children under its roof. Donations in money
or kind will be gratefully acknowledged by
the Rev. Mother. This haven for mother-
less youngsters stands in a healthy breath-
ing space of green lawns and gay flower
beds. Sisters of Mercy are in charge.
The Shakspeare tercentenary meeting last
week took nearly two hours to decide whe-
ther it should decide not to decide on any-
thing definite for the present. It finally re-
solved to go ahead and do something or other
some time or other. Any citizen who cares
to hand in a suggestion can do so without
risk to himself on December 9. The execu-
tive committee will sort these non-explosives
in the Town Hall on that date.
A tendency to get back to flounces makes
one wonder whether we shall drift on to the
modified crinoline and the flat hats that
Millais liked to paint in the ’6o’s. This
summer’s parasol, rather small and with
a round, short-waisted effect, belongs to the
bustle epoch. Some of the modern hats are
as flat as the favorite Millais millinery, and
the fringe of that period has shivered on
the modern frock for some time. I’m await-
ing, with impatience, the d6but of the half-
promised 1913 bustle.
A horticultural college for women still
rumbles in the distance. No wealthy citi-
zen has rushed forward to hurl cash at the
affair, and the Government cow is rather
dry at present. So the suggestion of train-
ing women to the spade in N.S.W. seems to
be fainting quietly away—in spite of the
terrific price of potatoes.
Belated tales of the woes of being very
wet still circle round suburban card tables.
The tragedy of walking about in your best
clothes in a deluge was the theme of a re-
turned Cup lady’s discourse the other
afternoon. The Gov. Fullers’ drenched
garden party is still being churned over oy
wrathful Sydney dames who wore their
shoes full of water on that occasion. “When
we ran for shelter to the house, and got in-
side, we were ordered out, and had to go
and look for someone or something to get us
some kind of vehicle to take us away. The
only things to be found were small boys,
who disappeared with thpir gratuity and
were seldom seen again. We were luckier
than some of our acquaintances, for the
fifth urchin produced a rattletrap to keep
the deluge off our shelterless hats. Talk of
hospitality—!” The bitter end of this re-
mark was buried in a pink ice-cream.
“Fares paid,” the lure the desperate
housemother fastens on to her advt. for a
hired help, is producing an ingenious collec-
tor of petty cash. A week or so ago a large
gathering of surf-side matrons began to tell
each other of the treasure that had landed
per ferry boat that morning, collected her
return fare to the city, inquired as to the
size and religious convictions of the family,
and promised to return next day. Then a
dreadful suspicion _ fell on the assembly.
They were all describing the same treasure.
An epidemic of “fares paid” in that aquatic
suburb’s advts. had brought the casual
lady-shark along to collect the cash.
Mr. C. Hellemann has written a virile
setting for “The sea hath its pearls.” Long-
fellow translated these verses from the Ger-
man, and Hellemann has surrounded them
with a rippling accompaniment and some
strong heart-throbs in harmony.
Colonel Wallace, our Chief of Ordnance,
is liable to pack up his kit for the other side
any week. He goes to the grey Northland
to insDect its last word in fortifications.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORLAN.

(iUTVn&tV&I I A »» By THOS. E. SPENCER (Author of “ How McDougall
D* iV wit Tm. ms Topped the Score,” “Mrs. McSweeney,” “Spring Cleaning, etc.)
With a Frontispiece by Percy Spence. Crown Bvo. 296 pages. Price 1/-, Post Free, 1/1.
The genial author of “McDougall” and “Mrs. McSweeney” gave it as his opinion that
“Bindawalla” was the best book he ever wrote. He nursed it for years, polishing here, alter-
ing there, until he was quite satisfied that, as a story of bush life both from rhe humorous and
the dramatic side, it was good and faithful work. , . . . ,
Those who have become acquainted with Mr. Spencer s other books should certainly read
his last; they will be amply repaid. „ „ , , .. „ _
This is the largest book ever issued by the Bookstall Co. —a compliment to the author
and a decided advantage to the reader.
BOORS ON BUSHRANGING
Not having had a national war, Australia has only the history of the guerilla war-
fare carried on by the bushrangers against law and order to write about. Men like Ned Kelly,
Ben Hall and Frank Gardiner have furnished us with excitement in plenty, but apart Irom
newspaper or official reports there are few authentic histories. The stories here told have been
verified in the main by the authors, and contain much important information that has not
hitherto seen the light, and that oftentimes puts a different complexion on bushranging
episodes.
DAN KELLY, OUTLAW. By Ambrose Pratt. 1/-; Post Free, 1/1.
Being the memoirs of Daniel Kelly (brother of the famous Ned Kelly), supposed to have been
shot in the memorable fight at Glenrowan. The most convincing account ot the Kelly Gang.
THREE YEARS WITH THUNDERBOLT. Edited by Ambrose Pratt.
1/-; Post Free, 1/1.
Bushranging stories, like far-off fields, are ever green, and when the bushranger has a noted
personality and is not a mere robber, there is an added charm attached to the tale.
THE OUTLAWS OF WEDDIN RANGE. By Ambrose P-att.
1/-; Post Free, 1/1.
The many stirring episodes in Ben Hall’s life are depicted with such skill that while we are
reading actual history the whole thing has an air of genuine romance.
GENTLEMAN JACK. By Don Delaney. 1/-; Post Free, 1/1.
Altogether a rattling story, apart from the fact that the doings of the notorious Ben Hall
gang are woven in with the main plot, and lend it a keen note of tragedy.
THE DEVIL’S NIGHTCAP. By Lancelot Booth. 1/-; Post Free, 1/1.
The story of the Ben Hall-Gardiner gang. Historically true in outline, full of strenuous inci-
dent and dramatic tableaux.
THE CONVICT PUGILIST. By Geo. Cockerill. 1/-; Post Free, 1/1.
A tale of the early days when might was often right. < Contains graphic descriptions of fights
that frequently meant life or death. Exciting, thrilling and entertaining.
THE SPELL OF THE BUSH. By John X. Cameron.
1/-; Post Free, 1/1.
To many “The Spell of the Bush” is a living thing that haunts and charms simultaneously ;
but when to that is added the fascinating touch of bushranging, you come under an influence
that compels you to read on and on to the end.

Interior of the Throne-room in the Vatican on the occasion of the Audience given by the Pops to the ** Aeolian
Appreciation of THE PIANOLA
Reprint from a newspaper article pub-
lished in 1893 :
On the 10th June last, Pope Leo XIII.
gave a private audience to the “Aeolian”
in the Throne-Room at the Vatican. There
were present Dr. Fermin Toledo, repre-
senting the Pianola Company. His Excel-
lency Monsignor Caggiano de Azevedo,
General Chamberlain of His Holiness, and
Monsignor Raphael del Val, the Pope’s
private Chamberlain. On the Thursday
following, the “Aeolian” was played at
the private Mass of the Pope in the Con-
sistory Hall, and, on the same day. the
Pope gave orders to have an “Aeolian”
placed permanently in the Vatican.
from the Vatican.
ALMOST twenty years ago, an Aeolian Grand, the
immediate predecessor of the Pianola, was perma-
nently installed in the Vatican. It was. the first
musical instrument ever to receive this distinguished
honor, as authoritatively stated at the time.
Two Warrants of Appointment, one conferred by His
Holiness the late Pope Leo XIII., the other by His Holi-
ness Pope Pius X.. and the bestowal of the Order of
St. Sylvestre upon the Pianola Company’s representative,
indicate an unprecedented measure of approval from this
high source.
His Holiness, Pope Pius X., has expressed his apprecia-
tion of the Pianola Company’s most famous instrument
—the Pianola —in several letters written by the Papal
Secretary, Cardinal Merry del Val, one of which follows:
The Vatican, April 29, 1909.
The Pianola Company,
Sirs,—
The Holy Father is much pleased with the beautiful Tliemo -
dist Pianola which you have installed.
Your firm was the first to bring instruments of this kind
to the attention of Ilis Holiness, Leo XIII., of happy memory,
and lie expressed to you His great satisfaction.
There is no doubt that your firm may well stand in the
first rank amongst those who manufacture instruments of this
The Holy Father, Pius X., has instructed me to express
to you in His August Name, His appreciation and His good
wishes for the success of your enterprise.
Kindly receive also my appreciation and the expression of
my distinguished esteem.
R. CARD. MERRY DEL VAL.
It is not possible to escape the significance of the
extraordinary clientage of the Pianola.
Owned by the Rulers, Nobility, and most distinguished
personages of the leading European countries, this
instrument occupies a position of international su-
premacy, attainable by no commercial process what-
ever, save sheer and unmistakable superiority.
It is to the public’s advantage to know that there is
BUT ONE PIANOLA, and that this instrument is to
be obtained in combination only with the three follow-
ing makes of pianos :
The Steinway, Steck and
Stroud Pianola Pianos.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 2, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Davis Cup tennis lias had all Melbourne
bouncing into trams this week. The sex that
has most time on its hands could be seen at
all hours clambering into the slow cable
vehicles that trundle down St. Kilda-road,
and showing lengths of white-stockinged leg
and the latest ideas in white shoes. Girls
hurried into town for a bite to eat; or to fit
in the usual singing lesson, and then scudded
down Collins-street like white rabbits. Quite
fierce arguments raged in the tea and scon-
eries. One tableful of young females de-
bated the play so hotly that the waiters
were at last drawn in to arbitrate, while
one excited girl fished a section of her
coiffure out of the remains of her ice.
On Friday, the last exciting tennis day,
when the Australians had to get the Doubles
or lose the treasured Cup, the 50-feet
high amphitheatre surrounding the court
fairly boiled with excitement. The adja-
cent side-street was choked with motors,
many of them bearing the double number
of re-registered owners from other States;
specially good seats in the new grandstand
had been booked in advance by lovers of the
gentle sport all over Australia. Most of the
vice-regal people were keen on the games.
G.-G. Denman looked on with interest; but
State Ex. Fuller seemed bored most of the
time. He might be more enthusiastic if
horses could be introduced into the proceed-
ings. The Fuller lady whisked about each
day, and on Friday enlivened the arena with
a purple coat fitted with enormously wide
wing revers. Auntie Phipps sat entranced
through it all, and seemed deliciouslv happy
and contented under a shady tennis hat.
The Denman lady’s little purple car found
a comfortable nook for itself at the corner
of tree-shaded Queen’s-road, and baked there
for many sunny hours. Dick Nevill tele-
graph-posted himself at the foot of the
members’ stand, and Gentleman Helps of
every grade haunted the place, leaving only
at the soft-call of duty, and throwing reluc-
tant last-looks behind them. Even Captain
Burnham, the golf and polo specialist of
the Denman staff, craned his neck. When
Friday’s play went to the Australians, Dun-
lop delightedly tossed up his racquet. But
next day (Saturday), the brilliant Parke
danced on our native Heath, and nothing
went aloft but the sponge.
It is exhilarating to watch Jones, of Aus-
tralia, when he really settles down to play.
He has a habit of nearly standing on his
head when about to clout a low shot, and
the stroke comes from an elbow almost flat-
tened on the ground. The graceful return
to the perpendicular reminds me of a small
boy’s “handspring.” A serious young man
is Jones, who only smiles on public holi-
days, and his irreverent friends have cheer-
fully labelled him “The Bandicoot.”
None of the English tennis champions
brought womenfolk in their train. Both
Beamish and Dixon are married, but beau-
teous young Gordon Lowe is still single and
unattached. He left his mother, Lady
Lowe, at home in the grey old city, and came
out unchaperoned. Mother is said to care-
fully supervise the young exquisite, and to
act as his bodyguard where designing females
are concerned. “Pussy” is the nickname
fastened to this crack dancing man of the
team. After the historic Red Ball of Cup
week, he was heard to remark blissfully, “I
danced with Lady Denman ! Won’t mother
be pleased!”
The present batch of champions are good
advertisements for the violently-genteel
sport. With the exception of F. G. Lowe,
none of them are particularly young; but
they, bound like antelopes and house cats,
despite the fact that Time has marked them
for his own with the pink crown that drives
a sensitive man to keep his hat on and
avoid sitting under galleries.
Rider Haggard is coming to Australia
early next year with a half-dozen commis-
sioners of the Board of Trade. One of the
half-dozen is Mr. Tom Garnett, whose daugh-
ter is Mrs. Geoffrey Syme. Andrew Marley
was originally included in the Board of
Traders ;. but his wife died with tragic sud-
denness in England, and the bereavement
may cause him to drop out.
Miss Hodgkins, the Maoriland artist, is
njaking a stir in the Centreway with an ex-
hibition. of water colors. She arrived quite
unheralded from Paris and thereabout, where
she has been working and studying. Some
Melbourne artists grow garrulous in praise
of her “stuff,” and say the lady out-
Blamires the decorative Young in color
sense. Vice-regal support has been forth-
coming, and the Denman cheque-book has
shed a blessed leaf or two on the show. The
Fuller lady swept in as soon as she returned
from the Gippsland riding tour. She and
attendant aide Curwen looked round the
show, and then petrolled home at top speed
to fetch John.
The marriage of Miss Rose Clarke, eldest
daughter of the late Marcus Clarke, with
Mr. Brereton Bradley, of the Small Arms
Factory, Lithgow (N.S.W.), will take place
here on the last day of the year. Marcus
Clarke married Miss Marian Dunn, daughter
of John Dunn, the comedian, and sister of
Rosa Dunn, who became Mrs. L. L. Lewis.
The bride-to-be was over in Sjfflney last
month on a visit to her sister Marian, of the
“Get-Rich-Quick” co. ; she was accompanied
by Mrs. Bradley, mother of the young man
before whom she is to whisper “I will.”
Mrs. Geoffrey Syme gave a big party at
Banool, Studley Park-road, one afternoon
last week, and visitors took the opportunity
to look at the bullet holes. A pillar in the
lounge at the head of the stairs has a cavity
that will swallow the point of a sunshade.
Another murderous-looking plaster scar
shows on the wall just above the middle of
Mr. Syme’s couch. On the upstairs gallery
lounge, where the struggle rasred, an orches-
tra made and shed peaceful music on the
feathered hats of the cooing crowd below.
Tenor Kirby carolled a few numbers from
the same loft. Mrs. Geoff was in a cham-
pagne-color dress covered with a straight
tunic cut to the knees ; a feather-decked hat
waved aloft. There were no less than seven
Mrs. Symes in the house, six of them being
the wives of the sons of David. Mrs. David
herself, gowned in black and white, looked
quite youthful. The smallest Mrs. Syme is
farmer Oswald’s wife —a charming little lady
all dimples and smiles. She wore a tussore-
colored dress with a lace cap between her
hair and the usual be-feathered hat. The
Wrixon lady came along the river to call on
her neighbor, and half'Kew’s young people
were present in their prettiest frocks. Mrs.
Lowther Clarke generously lent dignity to
the party without interest; Mrs. Agar
Wynne propelled a blue dress round the pre-
mises; and Mrs. Forrest, with cherry-colored
pipings on her purple frock, said good-bye to
various people. She shortly goes Westward
with her Bigjohn.
Artist Bess Norris, with husband James
lait, is coming back to Melbourne when the
New Year is young. The clever little Aus-
tralienne has been cutting fresh laurels in
London, and trimming her hat with them.
Women’s clubs are fairly plentiful in Mel-
bourne already; but Mrs. G. K. Edwards is
busily launching another, to be called the
Warrawee. Members are not only tumbling
over themselves to pay their subscriptions,
but are also giving her a linen and china
tea-party, by way of helping to furnish the
clubs trousseau. The party will happen in
the T. and G. Buildings, on Thursday of
this week.
The Town Hall was filled with argument
one day last week, when the (all aboard
for the Capitals !) First Annual Conference
ot the Victorian Association of Ladies’
Benevolent Societies (step off here and
admire the view !) got to work. Its first
work should have been to select a shorter
label; but somehow the important matter
was overlooked. The disposal of the Mater-
nity Bonus provided the charitable folk with
a lot of excitement. Amid the raging sea
of argument, little Dr. _ Springthorpe, look-
ing very alert behind his glasses, addressed
the gathering or boil-over on medical aspects
ot the work, while Mrs. Brewer fired off
some remarks under the severe and spec-
tacled title, “Judicious Benevolence.” The
conference has an imposing committee ready'
and willing to save the country’s frugal £5
from impostors who might be tempted to buy
drink with it.
Bert Bailey and his crowd made an excel-
lent start in Maoriland with “On Our
Selection.” The first performance in Auck-
land got him six “calls,” and Palmerston
North had to be cut out of the tour so
that the Auckland season might be length-
ened by a few nights.
Th® death, in a Melbourne private hospi-
tal, of Mr. John Good, of Ingemara station,
near Warrnambool, came as a shock to
Western District people, who looked to see
him about again after a spell of doctoring.
±he deceased squatter was only 40. His
wife was a daughter of the late Samuel
.Baird, also of the Western District.
Mrs. Jack Scott, who has been out of the
social firing line for months, owing to ner-
vous breakdown, is concentrating her ener-
gies on climbing aboard an outward-bound
steamer to see what an ocean voyage —nil
do for her. Her destination is London and
thereabouts.
The Forrest dame is out and about again
alter a fortnight’s sickroom seclusion in her
city hotel. Niece Muriel North, who was
brought over from Westralia for the Cup fes-
tivities, is bewailing in advance the trek
home, which is due as soon as the Federal
I arliament stops talking, and Bigjohn has
gathered up his papers.
Mrs. Horatio Webb is to act as hostess at
the Austral Salon on December 16. There is
some lasting quality about the Salon, the
original Melbourne club for women. Per-
haps it endures because it has never become
the Austral Saloon.
The Denman lady is to take full charge of
toe investiture of the Students of Honor”
at the Catholic Ladies’ College on December
4. (Is prize-giving out of fashion? “Inves-
titure sounds suspiciously like the creation
of female knights.) The Sisters of Charity

He is an unlucky man who meets a female
gusher in a public place. Saw a wretched
male nailed the other evening on a crowded
railway station by a virulent specimen. She
shamed him at great length by reciting the
names of all his relatives in a loud voice, and
asking after their health. When he had to
admit that the health of young Horace was
not as good as it might be, she fixed him
reproachfully with her eye and cross-exam-
ined him on the subject of patent medicines.
When she found he had not tried any, she
recommended four different sorts. Then she
resumed with the family, and refused to be
happy until Aunt Jane was posted as
“grand,” and Jim “as lively as ever,” and
Alice guaranteed “the same bundle of
tricks.” Finally she gave him a yearning
smile that was also a solemn warning not
to. disappoint her, and gurgled.. “And your
wife’s health now, is it splendid?” By that
time the wretched male could stand no more.
“No, it’s rotten,” he said, explosively.
The new Centreway Cafe, which is draw-
ing the fashionables across from the shady
side of Collins-street, fias a purely feminine
orchestra. A plump, pink girl plays the
piano, a soulful maiden with her hair in a
pigtail saws the violin, a third puffs deli-
cately through a flute, while a fourth em-
braces a large fiddle and induces it to purr
by sawing its back. The fine place contains
an absinthe-tinted dining-room for the crowd,
while the private rooms for the Very Best —
and Worst —are strawberry and blue. A
useful addition is a suite of special dressing-
rooms, . wherein wedding parties may make
their lightning changes. Loiterers in the
peach-tinted tea-room have discovered an ab-
sorbing pastime. Gazing upward, they see
the flitting foot-sole silhouettes of Centre-
wayfarers, on the cloudy glass, along with the
merest suggestions of skirt-hems.
Walter Barker is to have a genuine Harp
of Erin to twang when he makes music for
the “Ireland To-Day” show at the Town
Hall. The management was very keen on
getting a rale Hibernian instrument to give
local color to the old Hibernian airs,’and to
harmonise with the pictures on the screen.
The question was, where could it be got?
Barker was consulted. He remembered that
the Reverend Mother of the Loretto Con-
vent, at South Melbourne, had an Irish
harp of the true Emerald sort. So the Rev.
Mother was written to, and she wrote back
to the; effect that “Ireland To-day” and Mr.
Barker were welcome to the loan of dier
harp, and her best wishes would go with, it.
Never a flower or a blade of grass has
grown; by the wayside in Bourke-street
within the recollection of Melbourne’s oldest
inhabitant; but those long-felt wants are
about to be supplied at the top end of the
city’s . ancient thoroughfare. Next door, to
the White Hart Hotel, on the ground which
for years lay hidden from sight behind a
hideous hoarding, Mr. Arthur Russell has
built a three-storeyed hall of dentistry, or
palace of gold-fillings. The interior is said
to be fitted with germ-proof surgeries, in-
corruptible floors, scientific dental work-
shops and all the comforts of a home for
distressed patients. The Russell House
stands a little way back from the footpath,
and the spaces on either side are to be devoted
to works of nature. Thus roses and things
are to bloon in Bourke-stret, and the pass-
ing breeze will pause to listen to the sweet
words of gentle mignonette es she tells the-
red geranium of her love. It’s a great idea.
Apronos Tranby Croft, which got into this
Chatter the other day, Edward Legge, in his
new King Edward book, tells that after the
historical baccarat scandal Kaiser Bill wrote
to his uncle that “a man holding, the posi-
tion of hon. colonel in the German army had
no right to embroil himself in a gambling
scandal or play with people young enough to
be his sons.” This letter made Edward
furious, and led to a long suspension of in-
tercourse between the two. And the old
Queen also took a hand; for, though she
was very angry with Edward over the bac-
carat affair, she was angrier still with grand-
son Bill for his “impertinence.” I suppose
it’s all true; anyway, Legge belongs to a
prominent family of Court officials who
ought to know.
An interesting pair of girls, one a teacher
of singing and the other a gentle exponent
of face massage and the kihdred arts, find
recreation in running a scientific poultry
farm. They chose a sequestered part of a
Melbournian outer suburb for their run, and
in the vagaries of the incubator they get
relief from the perversities of pupils and
patients. The teacher of song is a strapping
wench of most business-like methods and
demeanor. Both are too smart and pretty,
from the mere man point of view, to lie
thus wasting their .sweetness on the fluffy
hair of baby hens and roosters, but seemingly
they are happy in their hobby. With their own
hands they have built a hen palace which is
a dream of poultry-farm architecture ; and if
pluck, energy and patience can make their
enterprise pay, they will presently add a
nice little banking account to their other
attractions. The musical partner, by the
way, uplifts her fine contralto voice in a
Melbourne city church.

“Looking Backward”: Melbourne’s first
census in May, ’36, is mentioned by the
veracious Oldest Grandpa’l
(B. 14/11/12). But the first Australian!
census (or muster, as it was called) was
m February,l7BB. It showed a total white
population of 973, or with the addition of
ladies,_ private servants, and others not ini;
eluded m the public return,” 1030. The rest
ot the live stock consisted of one bull, one
bull calt, one stallion, three mares, three
colts, and a number of domestic fowls. The
women numbered just over 200, and the
disparity of the sexes greatly per-
turbed # Governor Phillip. No census was
taken in England until 1801, there being
a „ wl^es P rea( l belief that it was a religious
offence to be followed by Divine wrath—an
enlightened opinion founded on the biblical
account of the numbering of Israel, from
Beersheba even to Dan, by King David in
1017 B.c. The Kmbbs of the day, whose
■ name was Joab, “began to number, but
finished not because there fell wrath for it
against Israel.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
Victoria’s Premier Watt is a procrastina-
ting sort of politician. The other day he told
the House that for many months he had been
negotiating with the Tramway Co. to induce
it to lower its fares, and was “hopeful that
his efforts would be crowned with success by
next April.” He alsq remarked that it was
desirable that a general Tramway Trust
should be created, to take over (1) existing
outside lines, and (2) the monopoly’s system
when the concession expires in 1916; but he
thought a Greater Melbourne Council should
precede the Tramways Trust. As to such a
Council, he had “hoped to introduce a mea-
sure this session, so that it could be dealt
with next year, but even that would not now
be possible.” It is all to-morrow, to-morrow,
to-morrow.
The verdict on the N.S.W. Labor party’s
bunch of M’s.L.C. is that they are, with one
exception, a poor lot, and have not con-
tributed as much debating strength as a small
party of mice in an assembly of grey-
whiskered cats. The exception, J. A. Browne,
promptly turned his outer garment, and
now he sides with the Tories. When the
Municipal Adult Franchise Bill went up,
Tom Hughes very briefly asked the Coun-
cil to toss it out, and, to the surprise of
everyone, not a single Labor member said a
word. The only sound came from Flowers,
who heaved a sigh of relief. In the way. of
municipal achievement, about the only thing
to the credit of the McGowen-Flowers Gov-
ernment is an Act to allow Allen Taylor to
appoint a substitute Gaud Mayor, so that he
might himself go to Hobart for a change.
The S. M. Herald has at last made the
discovery that the port of Sydney is seri-
ously congested :
Ours is a congested port. What are the chief
reasons? It seems that the congestion is due to (a)
insufficient wharfage accommodation, (&) Customs
delays, (c) faulty unloading, (d) insufficient con-
veniences for loading on waggons, (e) too few car-
riers, (/) no free access and egress, and ( g ) badly
laid out approaches and thoroughfares.
In the same way it could be explained that
the trams of Sydney are overcrowded owing
to (a) insufficient stopping places, (6) de-
lay in leaving the last pub, (c) faulty
methods of alighting, (d) inconvenient size
of tickets, (e) too few straps for hanging
on, (/) too few doors in the cars, and (g)
badly designed poster advts. The plain fact
is that just as the trams are crowded be-
cause there are too many people anxious to
ride in them, so the port of Sydney is con-
gested because the Sydney landlords, middle-
men and other Ipingers-on haven’t given the
other ports a chance to grow at all.
Prime Minister Fisher lately admitted
himself in favor of the initiative as a natural
corollary of the referendum, but thought
that it wasn’t a matter of urgency.
Doubtless there are many matters that
look more urgent, but if the initia-
tive were in force, a good many things
that are now pressing for attention wouldn’t
be so urgent because the people would long
since have ordered them to be done.
With the handy initiative, the Common-
wealth electors would long ago, for instance,
have told the national Parliament to get busy
with the direct Northern Territory line and
a dozen other things.
The Peace Society has a splendid chance
now. Plague has broken out in Noumea,
and plague is a dirt disease pure and simple,
and therefore preventable. The obvious thing
for the Peace Society to do is to urge Aus-
tralia to leave off taking local precautions
against the introduction of the plague, and
to rely wholly upon the good sense of
Hindoos, etc., to keep themselves clean, and
thus eradicate plague. If, on the other
hand, the Peace Society won’t trust the Jap
and the Chow to keep clean, and if it thinks
that we should have quarantine, and medical
inspection of oversea vessels, and so on. out
falls the bottom of the society’s anti-Defence
theories.
A WEAKLY HABIT.
LITTLE GERTIE (who has been reading): “I’a, what is protective mimicry?"
MR. M EEK: "That, my child, is when a weak animal imitates a strong one , so as to
ensure its own safety."
THE KID: “Oh, same as when you pretend you enjoy going to chinch with via?"
After the success of the Colonial Sugar
Refining Co. in blocking the Commonwealth’s
inquiry into the details of its business, the
legal proceedings against the co. and others
in Maoriland, under the Commercial Trusts
Act, will be watched with interest. The
statement filed by the Maoriland Attorney-
General sets forth that there is in existence
a ring of 83 firms, companies or persons. The
members of this alleged ring are said to have
among themselves fixed the selling price of
sugar to the public, and as all the sugar sold
in Maoriland is the product of the C.S.R.
Co., this amounted to an iron-clad monopoly.
And it is charged that the C.S.R. Co. and
the association or ring both refused to sell
sugar to people who were outside of it. The
defence is a general denial. The point that
interests Australians is that, although this
trust is said to have been in existence, sugar
was sold wholesale at £7 per ton cheaper in
Maoriland than in Australia, where most of
the cane is grown. Manager Knox has been
doing a lot of explaining of late ; but if the
Maoriland Government secures a conviction
and collects the £30,000 penalty the law pro-
vides, his explaining machinery will have to
work overtime.
The Argus scoffs at Minister of Agricul-
ture Graham’s “economic ignorance and bu-
colic prejudice,” because “he has been talk-
ing as though the middleman were a greedy
parasite growing fat at the expense of the
unhappy producer, upon whom he has wan-
tonly fastened himself.” It serves Graham
right. How could he, with the history of
the Victorian fruit, butter, meat, fish and
potato trade before his eyes, entertain any
opinion of the middleman but that he is a
special blessing and a living proof of the
beneficence of Providence?
The Argus is reviving an ancient delusion.
Freetrade, it says, is not dead; and corres-
pondents, dating from GeSlong and the gen-
eral cemetery, are permitted to enthuse over
the reawakening of foreign-trade sympa-
thies. We are informed that there, is “a
large and increasing Freetrade vote in Vic-
toria,” and one enthusiast is permitted to
say: “The Freetraders of this State would
be foolish to sink their principles to assist
the Tory prohibitionists to oust the Labor
party.” Poor old Argus ! Freetrade died
years ago, and the Argus put a light inside
the body, and paraded it as a live issue till
decomposition set in. Later it hawked the
bones. Now that the bones have fallen to
powder, it begins to fan the dust up in the
hope that here and there a speck may find
its way into an elector’s eye.
The N.S.W. Government will climb into
recess as soon as it can, and then it is
prettv certain that Beeby, Minister for
Lanas and Industry, will resign. If he de-
cides to drop out of the Labor party, which
is most likely, he will resign his seat in the
Souse, too, and contest it again as some
sort of Independent, with hopes of founding
a new political dynasty.
“G.V.W.” : The sale and control of liquor
by the State is an extremely sane and
reasonable proposal; but the fact that
Maoriland’s Bung is supporting an agita-
tion to get the question placed before the
people on the liquor-ballot paper invites the
cold eye of suspicion. At the last poll the
Wowsers and the State beer supporters beat
Bung on a national prohibition vote. Now,
Bung sees that if the State-control question
is added to the ballot paper his enemies will
be divided, and he will be assured of a fur-
ther long and profitable lease of life. I
hope his scheming will not succeed; but if
it does, my advice to those who favor State-
control is' to vote straight-out Prohibition.
There is no hope of the national pub get-
ting a fair chance until the private pub has
been finally ended. And, some time in 1914,
if the State-owned pub party and the no-
pub party vote as one avalanche, Bung will
go out for good. Then the State-controllers
can swing their own scheme into a fair and
open field.
The High Court has given the Millar’s
Karri and Jarrah Co. one to go on
with by proclaiming it to be rateable under
the Roads Act. For over a quarter of a
century, while the bona-fide settler has been
crying for a bit of road, and the Roads
Board has somnolently watched its annual
grant fade away, the jinkers, whims, trac-
tion engines and other musical instruments
of this and other Westralian timber con-
cessionaires have been steadily breaking up
the old tracks. During the same period the
various jarrah trusts have annually, by
political and other devices, evaded the pay-
ment of Roads Board rates. After 25 years
of dodging the rate collector, the Supreme
Court was cruel enough latelv to insist that
the Millar combine should weigh out; and
now, when appealed, to, the High Court has
ordered it to weigh in.
The redistribution scheme of Federal elec-
torates in N, S. Wales shows how the con-
gestion policy is working. Two country
electorates wholly disappear. These are Riv-
erina and Macquarie, while the Gwvdir is
recast, and shifted eastward into a new elec-
torate to be called the Namoi. Meanwhile
the bloated city is handed two more seats
one in North Sydney and the other near
Botany. The net result is that Sydney with
450,164 voters, returns 13 members, whim
the country, with 485,580, returns 14. It’s
a great record of Bloat and Blight.
A passenger on the German mailboat
from Japan told a Sydney reporter that in
German New Guinea there is a thriving
boat-building industry. It is in the hands
of Japanese, and the same little brown
people have another ship-building yard at
Admiralty Islands. Both these establish-
ments are turning out large coasters driven
by internal combustion engines. It must be
all very comforting to the Peace party, as
well as to Fisher’s Piecemeal party.
Premier Watt has just introduced the
annual bill to extend for another year the
municipal subsidy of £lOO,OOO to shires,
many of them rich enough, but most of them
too mean, to pay for their own roads, bridges,
etc. As Watt’s Country Roads Bill—to re-
lieve the country landowners of the expense
of putting the State’s main x-oads in decent
order —is experiencing a rough passage, it
looks as though Watt doesn’t expect to get
the measure through at all, in spite
of the Country party’s climb-down. In
fact, it is hard to indicate any measure of
importance that Watt can hope to pass.
With a general election not far away, Watt
dare not submit anything with a plain Tory
complexion; yet anything with any other
sort of complexion is bound to be either
mauled by his own alleged Country party
supporters in the Assembly, or suffocated by
the representatives of a few property-owners
when it reaches the Council.
Angry with certain members who think
bank clerks should be as free to marry as
other members of the community, the Argus
declares that “the matter is no concern of
Parliament’s.” The Argus is a regular
devil of a paper for immigration. Its anxiety
to have our empty spaces stocked with free,.,
easy and accessible immigrants is quite dis-
tressing. But the efforts of bank directors.-,
to restrict the output of young Australians-,
by limiting the matrimonial opportunities of '
their employees is “no concern of Parlia-
ment’s.” In thousands of cases, apart fnom s
banking business, employers are compelled [
to trust to the honesty of their employees. .
Suppose all of these sought to prevent the •
giving of their “hands” in marriage, so that :
increased responsibility might hot induce •
the latter to dip too frequently into the till. .
would the Argus still think it no concern of ’
Parliament’s?
“Tussock” from London :
I agree that many of the methods of the mili-
tant suffragettes are idiotic and banal and unjustifi-
able. But what are they to do to call public atten--
tion to the disabilities which women labor under ini
this country? It is no good whispering your
wrongs into the leaden ear of the 8.P.; they must;
be shrieked. The Freetrade Government now in
power is bitterly opposed to giving women the vote,
on grounds that are intimately related to fiscal ism.
Many of the industries out of which the big Lib-
erals or Whigs draw their vast dividends are abso-
lutely living on cheap female labor. Give women
the vote and they would be able to bring political
pressure to bear to raise their wages, and bang
would go a large part of the U.K.’s export trade. If
you study the commercial problem locally you find
that with the exception of the engineering and coal-
mining trades the whole rests on the patient back
of the sweated female. Cotton, linen, wool, jute,
jam, pickles, sauces, lace, made-up clothes, pots and
pans, and even chains and a lot of iron things and
motor-car parts and bricks are handled by women.
It is mainly on behalf of these wretched citizens
that the suffrage war is being waged ; and the abso-
lute imperviousness of the Government to argu-
ment has driven the women to acts which will com-
mand public attention. For the moment they don’t
want sympathy. All they want is attention.
“Looking Backward”: Just 20 years ago
Sir Gavan Duffy wrote in the Contempor-
ary Review his papers on “Conversations
with Carlyle,” and I want to heave a chunk
of the heavy sage’s wisdom at that timorous-.
Protectionist, Alfred the Unready. Speak-
ing of Amei-ican and Australian politics he-
says: “Their Freetrade is the most intense-
nonsense that ever provoked human patience..
The people of Australia are quite right to-
protect their industries and teach their-
young men trades in complete disregard of:
Parliamentary and platform palaver. No
nation ever got manufactures in any other
way.”
Government land-purchase for closer
settlement purposes was always a satisfac-
tory business for the man who owned plenty.
Maoriland started out 20 years ago with a
graduated tax to secure some cheap soil for
the man who wanted to grow a few turnips
and things; and, possibly, if the tax had
been big enough and left to do its own work
the cheap soil might have come along. But
the Government started in as another enei'-
getic buyer of estates, and prices continued
to rise. Here is the record per acre of a
farm that has changed hands many times:
1894, £ll 155.; 1896, £l5; 1899, £22 10s.;
1904, £3O 10s.; 1907, £4O ; 1909, £65. Pre-
sumably it is now worth £lO0 —and will sell
readily for quite £2 10s. when the bloated
bubble bursts and Cohen puts the bailiff in.
THE LINEN KNIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
William McMillan said that the distance to Mel-
bourne and the time occupied precluded many men in
business from entering Federal politics; but even if
that obstacle were removed it was a question whether
the present circumstances of State politics in N. S.
Wales were not more important to the citizens. His
desire was to return to public life, and strive, not
merely for the Liberal party, but for a high ethical
standard. —Daily paper.
My bleeding country calls on me,
In peril dire it stands;
Fat rushes wildly towards the sea,
To ’scape from Labor’s hands.
While Wood is mostly in the soup,
And Wade is in Japan,
Throughout the State the Liberals wait
A Leader and a^Man!
When Socialistic spoilers hold
The Mother State in thrall,
My linen must remain unsold —•
I care not. When the call
To duty soundeth in my ears,
Let summer goods go hang;
I will be found amidst the sound
Of battle’s clash and clang.
How sweet the looks that ladies bend,
At tea and seed-cake fights,
Upon the chosen ones they send
Forth as their doughty knights !
I knew their favors oft of yore,
At many a Liberal spree,
And I would fain once more regain
Their smiles and scones and tea.
I’ll stand enthroned ’mong lesser men,
Serene of mind and sure;
My strength shall be the strength of ten,
Because my heart is pure!
Hand me my trusty yard-wand, page!
He’ll perish who resists
When, robed in white, the Draper Knight
Goes charging down the lists!

You need the
Claviola Piano-Player
in your home
because it brings to every member of your family, old or
young, with or without piano-playing ability, the power
to produce correctly in Tone, Touch and Interpre-
tation, the great musical works for the piano —from
operatic, classical and sacred music to the latest popular
waltzes. It does away with all the years of constant study,
drudgery and practice in learning to play by hand.
The CLAVIOLA PIANO-PLAYER.
The Cabinet CL AVI OLA, for attachment to any grand or upright piano,
has a handsome appearance, and is an acquisition to any drawing-room. But
it is not the artistic outward appearance that has won for the CLAYIOLA the
great superiority it so justly enjoys, but its wonderful construction. It is made
in a most ingenious manner by highly skilled workmen, and is constructed of
specially selected materials.
There is an entire absence of rubber and other perishable materials in the
Claviola, THE TUBES ABE MADE OF METAL AND THE BELLOWS
OF A SPECIALLY PREPARED LEATHER. These EXCLUSIVE
FEATURES not only produce the finest possible results, by doing away with
thh troubles of leaky tubes and bellows, but they ensure longer life for your
instrument.
The Claviola plays the Artists’ Music Rolls, exact records note for note,
expression for expression, of the actual playing of celebrated pianists, and they
produce artistic results that stand positively unapproached.
We shall appreciate a visit from you to our CLAVIOLA SALON, where
one of our Salesmen will demonstrate in full, the merits of this wonderful
instrument. We sell the CLAVIOLA for cash or on easy Time Payments
extending over one, two or three years.
Interesting Art Booklet, fully describing the CL A VIOLA,

LADIES’ NURSE STRONGLY RECOM-
MENDS DR. MORSE’S INDIAN
ROOT PILLS.
There is no person who comes so inti-
mately into the life of the sick as the
nurse. She stands next to the doctor,
watching and noting the effect of treatment
and medicines, and becomes only second to
him as an authority. A nurse of twenty-
four years’ experience in Rozelle, who has
recommended Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
in many cases, says she cannot speak too
highly of them, and that in all cases they
have proved equal to the needs of patients.
“As an old resident of Rozelle for thirty-
two years, out of which I have spent twenty-
four years nursing,” writes Mrs. Margaret
Gallan, of 3a Moodie Street, off Western
Road, Rozelle, “I can safely say that Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills have my best
recommendation to my patients for occa-
sional use after their confinements. They
have proved in all cases most satisfactory,
and I speak from practical experience of
their use. In my home they occupy a place
as our family medicine, and both young and
old members take them when necessary.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Davis Cup is booked to take its first
sea-journey for four years; and whether it will have
to do a quick return depends mainly on Irishman
Parke being soon lynched, roasted, hanged or other-
wise disabled. For Parke is the real cause of the
disaster. The destiny of the Cup really depended on
whether Norman Brookes could beat him; and the
Australian Napoleon of the game couldn’t manage
it. The doubles were regarded as a certainty for
Australia; Brookes was looked to to beat Dixon,
and it was somewhat of a foregone conclusion that
Heath couldn’t stand up against either of the Eng-
lishmen. In the struggle that mattered, Brookes
won the first three games with the loss of only three
strokes. Then Parke woke up with a bang, and put
the acid on Brookes, who was regarded as acid-
proof, to the alarming extent of 8-6, 6-3, 5-7, 6-2.
Brookes didn’t seem to have even a look in; he
stood and wondered at the long drives the Irishman
brought off. Their deadly accuracy was something
new to him, and he was demoralised. Australia’s
tail showed a downward curl. But all was not lost
yet. Rod Heath faced the music with Dixon.
Heath won the first set —and lost each of the other
three (4-6). So the Englishmen had one leg in the
Cup, so to speak. The doubles didn’t take much
arguing. Brookes and the cheerful Dunlop romped
away from Beamish and Parke by 6-4, 6-1, 7-5, and
that kept England’s second leg momentarily out of
the way. On the final day Brookes met Dixon, and
DIXON, the English tennis captain.
Parke faced Heath. Both were almost foregone
conclusions, and only lasted three sets. Brookes took
his match 6-2, 6-4, 6-4; and that left Parke and
Heath to worry out what was to happen to the Cup.
Parke decided, and by winning (6-3, 6-4, 6-4) col-
lected the Cup for .England. A. B. Jones (N.S.W.),
the emergency Australian, made Brookes, who must
have been upset after the first day, still more un-
comfortable on the second day. Lowe (Eng.), who
had donkey-licked Rice just previously in the Vic.
tourney, clashed with Jones in an exhibition match,
and Jones emerged from the wreckage on top (6-4,
6-2). It must have make Brookes wonder why he
hadn’t dropped Jones into the big match and kept
Heath out.
As mentioned last week, the Englishmen’s weak
point is their service, as the following list of ser-
vice games shows: —
Won. Lost. Double faults.
Brookes 30 12 6
Heath . . 15 21 9
Dunlop . . 5 2 0
Parke 30 14 6
Dixon . . 17 18 26
Beamish .. 5 2 2
Thus the Englishmen served 34 “doubles” to Aus-
tralia’s 15, Dixon (Eng.) being responsible for 26.
It was Parke’s drive and nothing else that brought
Brookes his Waterloo, and incidentally shifted the
silverware to other quarters.
The Englishmen play N.S.W. this week in Sydney,
and then make a tour of N.S.W.
“Swagger” : In my fading recollections of
the Melbourne Cup crowd, only two figures are
printed in fast colors. (1) A big buck nigger m
gorgeous array (one of Mclntosh’s imported boxers,
I think). (2) The fine white Australian girl who
hung on to the nigger’s arm. The injudicious sup-
porters of professional boxing have several evils to
answer for, and the adoration of buck niggahs by
white women is one of them.

“Demon” Spofforth has been suggesting in
London that, to Wfake cricket livelier, two runs should
be allowed against the batting side for every maiden
over. The idea is that slow bats would be forced
into having a go, and so would either get runs or get
out; and then perhaps English people would come to
watch. But Spofforth—perhaps through having been
a bowler himself —does not propose any bowler-muz-
zling. His new rule would seem to need as a corol-
lary that a bowler who obviously makes no attempt
to hit the stumps shall be no-balled. Anyway, for
one reason or another, Warner and Schwarz and a lot
of other authorities on the game give his suggestion
their cordial curse.
James Aldridge, of Richmond Park stud
(S.A.), back in Adelaide after an English alleged
summer, tells the sporting pressmen that racing in
Australia spoils you for it in England. There, every-
thing is for owners and professional followers of the
game. The general public doesn’t seem to be wanted
-—except at some of the new proprietary suburban
courses. But Aldridge likes the method of yearling
sales. No long-winded remarks; the puff preliminary
is all in the catalogues. His own purchase was the
young sire, St. Anton, by St. Frusquin. Aldridge
thinks Prince Palatine the best horse now in training,
Tracery (the Leger winner) the best of the three-
year-olds, and Craganour easily the best two-year-old.
Wootton is the best-behaved “boy” possible out of the
saddle; but in it, “like Archer before him, the lad
likes to win all of his races, and anxiety to score
causes him to overstep the mark a little bit.” Which
is exactly the parallel The Bulletin drew when the
boy was last disqualified. Still, anxiety to win is a
good fault in a jockey.
The One Mile Amateur Cycling Cham-
pionship, of N. S. Wales test, postponed over and over
again, eventuated on Saturday at Sydney Agricultural
Ground —on the heavy dirt track, of all places, so
speeds were ;slow. The surprise was _ the defeat of
Australasian champion Burtinshaw, ' in the fourth
heat, by H. M. C. Adams, a rising rider from Eastern
Suburbs (Sydney). Still, it was an act of_ Provi-
dence —-Burtinshaw’s handles worked loose just as
Adams unwound his sprint, and Burtinshaw could
not respond. In the final, Beck (Balmain), Hooper
(Western Suburbs), Cutliffe (Redfern) and Adams
(Eastern Suburbs) were the contestants. Cutliffe
was .too good for Hooper, but could not stall off
Beck, holder of the 10-miles title, who won by a
narrow margin. Adams fell back and lodged a pro-
test, which will be under consideration by the time
this is read.

Among the distinguished visitors at pre>
sent browsing in Sydney is Sydney Jenkins, cham-
pion professional cyclist of England. He is here for
the J. D. Williams’ Six Days Race, which commences
on the Cricket Ground about three weeks hence. He
has kicked up some dust in his time, among his
victims, being the great Frank Kramer himself, Major
TaylSr, Ellegaarde of the beautiful legs, Jacquelin
and others. Although a professional he does not live
on the game, and is in business. When it is a case
of letting racing or his business go, racing goes—-
which is why he has not been heard Of during the
last few seasons. He is now 33. It is more than
probable his team mate will be Englishman T. J.
Gascoyne.
Billie Ryan engaged Alf Goodwin to box
O’Grady in Adelaide, with power to postpone in case
of rain. It rained, and the contest was put off for
two days. Then it rained worse, and he put it off
for five more. Goodwin did not then turn up, and a £2OO
gate (estimated) was wastedi Thereupon £lOO
damages were claimed by Ryan. The law case was
a close go, but Goodwin got a decision on points.
That is, the agreement gave a right to postpone, but
did not say “from time to time.” Ryan postponed
once, and ' that exhausted his rights. Nonsuit ac-
cordingly.
The resurrected Hock Keys having broken
some small bones in his mauleys while training for his
fight with Jean Poesy, that disturbance glided away
into the haze, and at about a week’s notice Francis
O’Grady (himself a French gentleman from the
West) was called upon to step into the vacant punch-
ing place. He came into the ring in far from
perfect condition; but he felt easier when he saw
that his opponent was also hog-fat. There was no-
thing wrong with Poesy except that his equatorial
bulge proclaimed him quite unfit for a fast battle.
Sydney climate evidently suits the Frenchmen. Poesy
had plenty of strength, but no speed. O’Grady
toured the ring, explored every corner, of it;. cut
across it, and back again ; then round and round it.
And always behind marched Poesy—steady, dogged,
hopeful ; but always just too far away to do any hit-
ting. Once Fabius Poesy got Hannibal O’Grady in a
corner, and with both hands free was knocking the
sawdust out of him when he was warned not to in-
dulge in in-fighting. Terrified of committing a
breach, he thereafter ceased fighting immediately
O’Grady got his paws on him. O’Grady should have
been disqualified for holding with one glove and hit-
ting with the other. The referee cautioned him
several times, and it is bad policy to caution more
than twice. AVhen O’Grady got out of tribulation, on
the occasion before-mentioned, he determined that
Jean should not get him again. And Jean didn’t.
Once Poesy gave a burlesque of O’Grady’s tactics and
fled, but O’Grady declined to follow. Poesy vainly
beckoned to him, but O’Grady smiled cojly, and
stood afar off. So Poesy resumed the’ pursuit.
O’Grady had frankly given up attempting to hit
Poesy—except on the gloves. And by continually
tapping Poesy’s gloves and keeping out of reach
himself, he accumulated points. He won on points
—and by points.

The conclusion of the fifth round of Syd-
ney First Grade Cricket saw many changes of posj
tion. But, notwithstanding, North Sydney is undis
turbed in its proud eminence, with nine points to
the six of Redfern and-five of University. Padding-
ton has four, and below that they range from two
above to six below zero. North Sydney’s margin
would have been bigger still had it not failed to
overthrow University, and succeeded only in making
a draw. University had left 236 to eclipse, and
North’s chances looked very blue when Stack took
four wickets for 57. But North managed to keep
up the fainting innings till the light gave out, when,
having lost seven wickets for 146, it escaped from a
hopeless position. Gordon gave Waverley a smash-
ing, winning outright by five wickets. Waverley
had smacked 147, and felt fairly secure when Gordon
responded with only 90. Then its luck gave out,
and the batsmen were slush before the besom of
Macartney, who took seven for 29. And what
escaped the Scylla of Macartney fell into the Charvb-
dis of Shortland, who destroyed three for 11. The
side vanished for 69, no less than five men being
dismissed without breaking the shell. Gordon then
proceeded to wipe out the balance, and with 131 for
five wickets scored a glorious victory. Central
Cumberland’s handling of Middle Harbor was severe,
presumably in revenge for the treatment dealt out
to Moxham (who represents Parramatta) by Speaker
Willis, who comes from Middle Harbor. The Harbor
was dismissed for 146, and then Central Cumberland
walloped up 301 for seven wickets, and so won by
three sticks and 155 runs on the first innings. Pad-
dington’s victory over Balmain was another one-
innings event—2l9 to 204. Over-caution robbed
Burwood of a victory over Sydney. With 234 on the
board for nine wickets, Burwood decided to close
and rage through Sydney before time ran out. But
Cohen and Jenkins declined to be raged over, and
knocked up 45 and 46 respectively. It wasn’t the
scores they made that mattered, it was the beastly
time they took over it; for when they had been
scrunched and a few other trifles disposed of, the
light had gone, and Sydney, with only 172 on the
board, escaped into a drawn game, because it still
had two hopeless wickets standing. Redfern’s down-
ing of Petersham was a clean, workmanlike job.
Petersham was cleaned up in the first innings for
141—a good working score, to which Redfern re-
sponded with 175. Petersham then put on another
160, leaving Redfern 127 to get to win. They were
smacked for six wickets, and Redfern went home
with four wickets to burn.
It was a bowlers’ round absolutely, the highest
score being the 94 of C. Wheatley (Balmain). The
bowling of Macartney was terrific—seven for 29 on
Saturday last and 12 for 73 for the whole match.
S. Lloyd (Waverley) took seven Gordon wickets for
51 during the match ; E. Coffey (Burwood) seven
for 87, and Dr. Hordern seven for 90.
PARKE stands ready for action.
An unusually large number of spectators
viewed the collision of the so-far undefeated ’Roy
and ’Wood cricket teams, in Melbourne Pennant
Competition on Saturday. It was a day when. the
spectator, seated in a shady spot, with long-, cool
drinks handy, had the better part, and there being
no : incentive to excitement or violent hand-clapping
he : passed a mostly pleasant, ruminative afternoon.
’Wood won the toss, and accumulated 284 for nine
wickets; so, unless something more or less miracu-
lous happens, it threatens to either win or draw.
South, for whom the lusty colt, Harry Trott, ex-
Australian captain, made 40, accumulated 241
-against P’ran. Carlton laboriously put together 190
against St. Kilda, and 12 perspiring ’Dons —the 12th,
named Sundries, being mentioned, because he made
the third-highest score—gathered 104 in two hours
of toilsome -effort; North replied with 113 for three
wickets, and there the argument sits. The undefeated
Students encountered the thoroughly walloped pre-
miers, ’Cote, but their respective sequences of victo-
ries and defeats threaten to be broken, inasmuch as
’Cote got its back up and slammed up 319 for nine
wickets. Richmond had the bye, and indulged in
gentle recreation at the expense of Brunswick; and
Bast played with Melbourne, which collisions were
vain things and as naught.
The Australian Turf these times could do
with a few of the rules and regulations against foul
riding that are said to have taken the heart out
of jockeys in the Cold Country. Stewards on the
other side nowadays forbid the fighting for “inside
berths” and “hemming-in” tactics which are ordinary
features of Australian circular-course racing. Even
the probability of bumps and jostles is provided
against, by requiring the boys to stick to the posi-
tions they have at the start until their inside neigh-
bors drop back beaten. A jockey that draws an ex-
treme outside billet is expected to travel wide to the
end of the journey. In the wide margin of difference
between the English go-as-you-are-placed and the Aus-
tralian 1 go-as-you-darn-well-please, there is room for
a reasonable compromise, and the A.J.C. and Y.R.C.
ought to fix it up.
ri ? UC^ ®, un , French success died
o ut on Wednesday night last week, when
Herbert McCoy,
BEAMISH , a Davis Cup
player, after a little exercise.
the Australian
lightweight cham-
pion, fell upon
Leon Bernstein, at
Sydney Stadium,
and practically
knocked him out
in the tenth
round. Officially,
the police stopped
the fight; but
Bernstein was dead
to the world when
the form of the
Law rose and for-
bade any further
bloodshed. Bern-
stein made a good
beginning; in the
fifth round he
played up to some
purpose, stagger-
ing McCoy in a
way that made
that toughened
youth decidedly
anxious. Blit the
Australian came
back, and in the
eighth round let
loose a rally from
which the Parisian
never really recov-
ered. Bernstein was
badly rattled in
the ninth, and in
the tenth he was a
bullock for the
slaughter. Knocked
down, he fell
through the ropes
on to his back,
where he lay till
seven, when he
started to revive.
At 10 he was on
his feet, looking
round with glazing
eyes. McCoy
walked across the
ring, measured the
distance and deliv-
ered the wallop.
The Gaul crashed
down in a heap,
and lay still. The
police signalled the
end. Scott pointed
t o McCoy, and
then the Frenchman was carried to his chair. McCoy
hit him unreasonably hard; a gentle push would
have done the job just as effectively and a lot more
humanely.

The “gates” of the recent Westralia v.
N.S.W. cricket match having turned out to be of the
frozen variety, the N.S.W. Cricket Association voted
£IOO to the Westralians to keep body and soul to-
gether till they got home. Then, finding there was
a deficit of £35 on the two matches, the amount
was deducted from the grant, and the £65 hard cash
handed over to the rejoicing ’Gropers. The public
has intimated in what the political writer calls “no
uncertain voice,” that it will not pay a bob a time
to watch second-rate inter-State matches. Why not
in future drop the price to the humble “sprat,” and
effect a clearing sale of surplus seating aceommoda-
tion?
Although there are wild rumors and fret-
ful mutterings in the Sydney cricket camp relative
to the benefit to Victor Trumper, of the Sorry Six,
the N.S.W. Cricket Association has gathered the bull
by the nose and fixed the match for January 31 and
February 1,3 and 4. The Association has done its
best, and nothing short of a general strike of the
cricketers could now upset the apple-cart.
* * * *
The “colts” who have battled for N.S.W.
of late in inter-State cricket, have done well in
winning two matches from Queensland and scoring
a win and a -draw against Westralia. Probably they
will be dropped for the old folk in the more business-
like matches against Victoria and South Aus. But
it would be well if the selectors didn’t drop too
largely, and dropped with much discrimination. The
colts play all the time, while the old war horses show
an inclination to play only when they feel inclined,
and the desire of the old chargers to frequent spells
should be satisfied and catered for. Of course, in
some cases, as in the bowling of Mailey and Massie,
the colts must in justice be selected on form. But
there is plenty of room for scientific and sympathetic
discrimination.
My Gavonni, winner of Queensland Sum-
mer Cup at Brisbane on Saturday, put up quite a
stirring performance. With the heavy swag of lOst.
91b. up, he showed nicely manicured heels to a field
of 15 other brutes, and gave ~ away weight to a
maximum of 581 b. .

Howl Babylon! Yerily in Australia shall
the year 1912 be known as Ichabod ! The. Leopards
of England hold the ashes; Arnst left the sculling
championship in the Thames; now the Davis Cup
has gone. The returned bowlers explain it was hos-
pitality that spoiled their record, and the rotundity
of some of the bowlers gives a sniff of truth to the
statement. We haven’t got much more to lose, and,
according to the Scripture, we shall probablv lose
even that.
THE RULING PASSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is a fancy of Pausanias the Greek that there be
fish in the rivers of Hell —even in Cocytus itself.
I dreamt last night I wandered down the stream
That laps the country grim where Death is King;
Where never light of day may cast a gleam,
Or joyful song-bird preen a wanton wing.
And there I found ’twas as the Greek had said:-
For up and down that gruesome haunted tide,
Before the sombre eyes of myriads dead,
I saw the ghosts of fishes turn and glide.
And on the banks there perched the strangest crew,
Who talked at large, but never fished at all.
Intent each other’s boasting to outdo
With legends of the paralysing haul
They’d made the week before of finny prey,
What time the river rose in casual flood,
And how their hands had made such cunning play
That, though the salmon fought the best he could,
With many a doubling swift and furious spin,
At last he found his piscine courage fail;
Whereon a skilful jerk had pulled him in—-
And lo ! he turned full thirty in the scale !
And when one fisher wight his tale had told,
His shadowy brethren wildly rose in turn
And each began, with twistings manifold,
To tell of wondrous feats in brook and burn ;
Till Ananias, chancing down that way
To wander with his bride, Sapphira pale,
Heard just one story—fled in wild dismay
For ever from that perjured fishing vale.
Yet ne’er a line did e’er a braggart pull;
No rod or reel did e’er a spectre ply;
With ne’er a catch, they kept their baskets full
By simply beating down each other’s lie.

“Much-travelled” Smythe, sen., talking of
the visiting stars of yore who flamed under
his direction, says that Richard Anthony
Proctor, the Popular Astronomy lecturer,
was by far the most magnetic, of the lot.
Mark Twain, Max O’Rell, Archibald Forbes
and others of the old brigade were rapid
money-spinners, but none of them made so
much as Proctor in his seven months’ tour
of Australia and Maoriland. lie was an ex-
traordinary draw. When he was in Sydney
a Sunday night show at the Theatre Royal
was advertised, but Henry Parkes prohibited
it in deference to the Nonconformist Con-
science, whereupon King-street became
blocked with riotous crowds, yelling for the
annihilation of the hairy potentate who had
forbidden a Sunday night lecture on the
Kingdom of Heaven.
“Simon”: The Bulletin (21/11/T2)
records that one of the brethren has pre-
sented the Victorian Baptist Union with a
scheme to put a doxology on wheels for
bush-mission work. This recalls Methodist
parson Horbury, who, when stationed at
Mudgee (N.S.W.) some 20 years ago, found
godly of Mount Buckeroo without a tab-
erifacle either mounted or on foot. The
brethren of that part were not overflush of
coin; so the Rev. Horbury hiked daily the
intervening eight miles, felled his timber on
the hill side, split his slabs, and eventually
hoisted a comfortable bush church that has
defied the elements and -the machinations of
the Devil ever since. A parson like that de-
served to live, but he didn’t. Shortly after-
wards he contracted typhoid and went aloft.

ESTABLISHED 30 YEARS.
A note with the Australian flag at the
top of it blows in from Hartford Building,
Chicago:—
The Australians and Maorilanders resident in
Chicago and other parts of Illinois have got together
and formed what we call the Australasian Society of
America. Since the first meeting (a very successful
one) applications for membership have been received
from Australians living in other States, and the
society looks like doing good. Its objects are to keep
Australasians in touch with each other and with
home, to help each other where possible, and by
every means in our power advertise Australia ii
America —-where Australia at present is not so much
inknown as mislcnown. Just how we will attain our
jbjects we hardly know ourselves, but as the oppor-
tunities happen we will take advantage of them,
hnd if they don’t happen, we’ll just make them.
If we can give a lift to any Australian who hap-
pens to be in America, we will. Don’t interpret that
to mean that we are in business with a financial end
in view. We don’t know what money is in this
matter.
We are having a considerable meeting on October
30, at which the British Consul and other notabili-
ties will be present; and we are going to show them
the Australian flag if they haven’t seen it before.
Fred Davison is president of the society,
Mrs. Hubert and A. T. C. Thorne vice-presi-
dents, and George Girling secretary and
treasurer.
“N. or M.” : The Tasmanian Assembly has
turned down the proposed vote of £SOOO
towards the cost of a canal at Port Cygnet;
so Lovett will have to shoulder the expense
itself or go without. At present the inlet,
which runs right to the township’s front
door —and, when there is an exceptionally
high tide, does not stop at that —peters out
to a film of shallow water and some mud
flats ; and residents clamor for a streak of
something navigable and a turning basin for
steamers. The place is famed for fruits,
large and small, and during the apple season
can hardly be seen for cases. It is rather
greener than the Emerald Isle itself. Settle-
ment dates back to the year when an Irish
regiment, quartered in Tasmania, was dis-
banded. In that year Erin was waving a
shillelagh, and it was considered that the
time-expired men would be doing more ser-
vice to the Empire by growing praties in
Tassy than “demonstrating” at Home. Most
of them took up the grants offered them,
and, until a few years ago, “the old pension-
ers” continued to form a picturesque back-
ground to the community. I fancy the last
of them is dead now. The manners and
morals of the district are presided over by
Father O’Flynn. At his call, the congrega-
tion rolls up in carts and afoot, attends its
devotions —and adjourns for refreshment.
Then it generally finds the tail of a coat
(conveniently dragged) to tread upon. And
the town council —well, nobody makes a talk
about it when an argument is driven home
with a paling torn from the nearest fence.
“The Old Soldier” : “Amies” (B.
21/11/’l2) is dissatisfied with the fighting
of the unspeakable one, and opines that, in
view of the amount of outside help and ad-
vice that have been accorded him, he should
have done better. But what effective as-
sistance have the Turks had, after all? The
German tactician, General Von der Golz, has
been with them for three or four years. And
the upshot was, when the Turks did go into
action, they were, in the words of their
mentor, “raw recruits” —that is, judged
from the European standpoint. And it was
to be expected that they should be. It
took 50 years to organise the Prussian army
which beat the Austrians in 1806. It had
been in training since 1830. It was not,
indeed, the army, but the nation, that was
being trained. Mark Sykes, M.P., who
knows the Turk as well as any English-
man, points out in the current Saturday
Review that it is always a gamble whether
the person in the fez will do extremely well
in battle or amazingly badly. This is be-
cause he has never yet been thoroughly
trained and organised. He depends conse-
quently for success almost entirely upon
brilliant generalship, luck and so on. Aus-
tralia has something to learn from this nat-
ural fighter’s misfortunes. The Balkan
armies have scored chiefly because for many
vears their armies have been training like
pugilists. Tireless organisation and con-
stant drill are the only things that trans-
form war from a wild gamble to an odds-on
chance.
“Kuscobin”: Does anyone know whether
it is a fact that Australia was more or less
invaded by a foreign enemy in 1813? In
his memoirs, Jorgen Jorgensen —he who
was King of Iceland, companion navigator
•of Flinders and a convict in Tasmania —
jives a very circumstantial account of an
unfriendly descent on these parts. He says
be was informed of the project by one Cap-
tain Dillon while imprisoned in Fleet-
street. Jorgensen lost no time in advising
the authorities of the Colonial Office, but
was laughed at for his pains. “I can’t think
such a scheme possible,” said a high official
there. “No one would want the colonies,
and even if they did and got them, it would
not be much loss. They cost us £IO,OOO a
j year, and we are getting nothing in return.”
! Nevertheless, some months later, two French
i and two American sloops started out to this
1 country for the purpose of sacking Sydney
1 and Hobart. The Frenchmen got wrecked
off Cadiz, but Jorgensen states that the
Americans actually arrived in these waters
and looted and destroyed 17 whaling vessels
off Van Diemen’s Land; and he avers th;P
it was for this reason sperm oil rose to a
record price in the London market in 1813.
I have not been able to find any other refer-
ence to this incident in the Mitchell Lib-
rary. Is there any record?
Following the British Medical Ass. in
! Sydney, which seriously considers the neces-
S sity of forcing doctors to enrol, the Vic.
Rural Producers’ Association, sitting at
Jeparit, has been earnestly advised by _mem-
bers to take steps to induce all those in the
association to entirely boycott such of their
neighbors as are not members. ; “Until a
farmer becomes a member, nobody should
speak to him.” Why have the “Greater”
dailies not instructed Packer, of the Free
Workers’ Association, to take steps to coun-
teract this pernicious unionistic tyranny?
“D.” offers a suggestion:—
I see that William McLinen, the “heaven-born
financier” who was at the helm when the vast
McArthur vessel smote the rock, proposes to come
back to politics and save the N. S. Wales “Liberal”
party—that is, if he can set a nomination, and win
a seat, and persuade the Wadeites to chuck their pre-
sent saviour and adopt him instead. But why McLinen
when Willis is available? What Liberalism needs is
a leader of force and character, a person who is the
antithesis of Wade —someone, in brief, who is cap-
able of getting into office and staying there. Willis
may have his weaknesses, but one thing is certain:
if he once got office, the Parliamentary dynamite has
not been invented that is capable of shifting him.
I And, under our Party Government system, what
better qualification can a Premier have?

Speeding' Up!
“ Speeding Up ” in Machinery Shops, where the equipment consists
of slow action, “low in efficiency” tools, usually leads to friction.
So long as an operator has to be, so to speak, constantly watching
a multitude of inconvenient levers with one eye, and the job in the
machine with the other, the work naturally suffers, both in quantity
and quality.
Put him on a modern tool designed with convenient motions—all
levers handy. Reasonably secure and easy in mind he can now devote'
his attention more to the job, and the result is a rapid production,
with no necessity to “speed up.”
Cincinnati Millers
never need "Speeding Up, because
Cincinnati Handiness _ enables the
operator to concentrate his thoughts on
the job, not on levers. He stands
close to the work, with the cuttei. in
full view, and controls the Machine
from this position. The Main Start-
ing Lever is right in front of him, and
the Speed and Feed Changes are at
his elbow. , . „ , f
Handiness is but one big feature ot
Cincinnati Millers: with it they com-
bine Few Parts, Simple Positive
Feed Mechanism, Special Indexing
Head of exclusive design, and ex-
treme Rigidity. *
These are some of the characteristics
which have earned for Cincinnati
Millers in Australia a high reputa-
tion for Milling and General Gear
Cutting.

THE DYING CONVICT.
(Incident of the early days of Tasmania.)
In a secluded nook
Near the rippling sea
Lay A dying convict under
A sheltering Tree,
As sufferings fevered
His burning Brain
He raved of loved ones
Across the Main.
The merciless guards were
On his Trail
To take him back to
Port Arthur gaol
But God left ’em their
Victim’s lifeless shell,
The poor lash-scared convict
Had suffered his hell.
N.N.L.: The MS. of “Lost Hopes” was so
drenched with grief that Mrs. Martha Washington,
who scrubs out, had to wring it over her bucket.
Weather at present too damp for such poems....
J.F.H.: Nothing suitable in the batch.... Eldon:
We persevered with your war poem until you tried
to rhyme “staggered” with “scabbard.” Then we
limbered up and retired in good order.... Erraticus:
Forgive you for the verses on account of the tranquil
picture of the tree-fringed Yarra at top of M 5....
F.L.A.: A poor lot of kisses. Get “The Kiss of
Dolly Day,” by Edmund Fisher, and learn from the
standard text-book on the grand, sweet sport....
Louburke: They do not meet with our approval. On
the contrary, we regard them (from the top of the
basket) with hatred and suspicion... .G.J.S.: Two
of them are old friends of ours. Afraid the others
may be old friends of our readers.... Splodger: Not

“Melb.” : This year’s annual soiree of the
Old Colonists’ Association was the poorest on
record. Less than a hundred Oldsters gave
their ears to the orators. What a contrast
to the time when Coppin and Purves used to
stir the cockles of the heart of a crowded
house! The thing dies out like Welling-
ton’s Waterloo banquets; the very expres-
sion, “Old Colonist,” gets fainter and
fainter, like the word “Colony.” This is the
handwriting on the wall for the Australian
Natives’ Association, which must become
redundant, too. Yet the A.N.A. was once
truly needed —in Victoria. The first Aus-
tralian generation was strangely unpoliti-
cal, and the A.N.A. did grand work under
the presidency of Purves and others in seeing
that the native-born seized what belonged to
them. Now, of course, the native requires
no prodding. To go back to the Patriarchs’
bunfeast, one Gibson was the best speaker.
Said he, in effect: “Don’t get old. Associate
with the young in preference to the old.
Don’t be a praiser of the Men of the Past,
for the Men of the Present are just as good.”
One wonders whether ex-Attorney-General
Glynn was listening—he who was just rely-
ing on Pericles and another ancient or two
to knock out the Hughes proposals for curb-
ing the very modern trust.
What a beautiful, rational thing is the
hatred of your disappointed State Spites
Tory! In the N.S.W. Assembly on Novem-
ber 27 :
Mr. David Storey: Let the Federal authorities do
what they like. They have nearly ruined this coun-
try with their infamous taxation and restrictions in
all directions. 1 am against them every time —
whether they are right or wrong.
If David Storey’s straw-hat department- em-
ployed a man who occupied some of David’s
time and warehouse in announcing that he
was going to blackguard David’s entire hat-
tery, whether it was right or wrong, and
denounce David’s hats whether they were
good or bad, there would be a vacancy _in
the straw-hat department pretty soon. Which
seems a pretty fair hint to Randwick,
especially as David Storey says that the
country ought to be run on business -prin-
ciples,

Sir Charles A. Cameron, C. 8.,
M.D., etc.,
writes: “Taking an interest in all
subjects relating to food, I have
procured samples of Sanatogen
and subjected them to experi-
ment. . . .
“In my opinion, it is the or-
ganic phosphorus which makes
Sanatogen of such value. . . .
A series of experiments proved
that Sanatogen is easily and com-
pletely digested. I have arrived
at the conclusion that Sanatogen
is a substance of the highest
nutritive value, containing as it
does a large amount of organic
phosphorus—that is, phosphorus
which is offered to the tissues in
exactly the form in which it can
be easily absorbed. It is an ex-
cellent food.”
“The Medical Times”
says: “There is no doubt what-
ever that the nutrition of patients
taking Sanatogen improves won-
derfully, due, in all probability,
to its being easy of assimilation
and to the organic absorbable
phosphorus which it contains.”
A thousand times this number of Physicians endorse
SANATOGEN
The Royal Tonic Food.
Over fourteen thousand practising physicians have recorded in writing their high
opinion of Sanatogen, and many thousands more are daily prescribing it with the
most beneficial results in cases of debility, brain fag, lack of vitality, sleepless-
ness, disordered digestion, poverty of blood and various wasting diseases.
Can you ask for more convincing testimony of Sanatogen’s value than the
fact that it is thus publicly endorsed and recommended by practically the whole
medical profession ?
Among the original letters in praise of Sanatogen which are filed for public
inspection, there are many from world-famous physicians whose names stand
for the highest scientific achievements. Their advice, and the example of
distinguished men like those mentioned here, it is safe for you to follow.
Irresistible as this evidence is, the reader can only realise the wonderful
revivifying effects of Sanatogen by taking it himself when his nervous system
and bodily strength have been undermined by overwork, worry or disease.
WRITE TO-DAV FOR FREE HEALTH BOOK.
You can buy Sanatogen at any chemists. Write to-day for a free copy of
Dr. Andrew Wilson’s health book, “The Art of Living.” Please mention this
paper, and address your postcard to:
A. WULFING & CO

SYDNEY.
Prof. Dr. C. A. Ewald,
of Berlin University, writes: “ I
have used Sanatogen in a number
of cases, mainly of a nervous or
neurasthenic origin, and have
obtained excellent results.”
Mr. Hall Caine,
the celebrated Author and Dram-
atist, writes: “My experience
of Sanatogen has been that as a
tonic nerve food it has on more
than one occasion done me good,”
Mr. W. Rhodes,
the famous Yorkshire Cricketer,
writes: “I have given Sanatogen
a good trial, and found it a
splendid tonic.”
Mr. A. G. Hales,
the famous War-Correspondent:
“I find my health benefits by
every tin of Sanatogen. It re-
vitalises a man, and is not a
drug.”

The fact that some of your teeth
are decayed although you have always
cleaned them is proof that the preparations
you have used do not preserve the teeth.
Use Odol! Being liquid, Odol penetrates
all the cavities and interstices in and between
the teeth, and permeates the gums and the
whole lining membrane of the mouth, providing
a safeguard and preservative for the teeth
such as no other dentifrice can possibly do.

Being charged with the duty of assuring the maximum of comfort, at the
least possible expense, she appreciates the advantages of a perfect lighting
system, which is absolutely safe and clean.
SHE KNOWS
that the installation of a gas service means the saving of an untold amount of
work and worry, and, more than anyone else, realises the benefits of having
a gas stove and bath-heater always ready to help her through the continuous
round of household duties.
The Immense Saving Effected by
QUIRK’S AIR GAS
is alone a very important factor, for it is far cheaper than any known lighting
agent, while—being non-explosive and non-poisonous—there is no need to be
constantly on one’s guard against accidents.

Victoria’s Watt Government promises to
appoint a commission to “inquire into the
operations of the brick trade, and the man-
ner in which companies are reported to act
in concert”—in other words, to investigate
the brick combine. The Watt Ministry almost
appoints a commission nowadays when it
wants to know the time. If Watt hadn’t
foolishly leased the Thornbury brick pad-
dock to a private company for a long, term,
he needn’t have bothered to do any investi-
gating. He could have been supplying all
SmbOurne with bricks by this time, at little
more than half their present cost; and the
combine—well, there wouldn’t have been any
combine.
From the Occasional Galleryite
The Sydney papers which claim to be law-abiding
and all the rest, rail tirelessly at the dangerous
“powers” which Speaker Willis exercises. As a matter
of fact, the further Parliament goes the more obvious
it becomes that they aren’t sufficient. For example,
the Assembly contains at least one chronic drunk;
who would be flung out of any decently-conducted bar
as often as he entered it. There are 10 or a dozen other
members who are bibulous and noisy. It would be
all in favor of good government if Willis had the
same discretionary powers in regard to nuisances of
this sort, as (say) the potman in an hotel. Better
still would it be for all hands, including the drunks,
if it were possible for him to have them medically
examined, and, on an unfavorable report, committed
to an Inebriates’ Retreat for a time. The spectacle
of a dozen M’s.L.A. being bundled into a Drunkards’
Home would have a better moral effect on the coun-
try than thousands of temperance lectures, and the
benefit to the House would be incalculable.

During the last Referendum campaign
N.S.W. Attorney-General Holman said the
Fedora rvVal mono P oli f’
1 ederal Attorney-General Hughes now asks
whether his Labor brother likes monopolies,
seeing that, having had the power for over
two years, lie hasn’t done a thing to end any

his learned biotliei, Icebeig told llllghes

States haven’t got the power. If so good a
Liberal as the Iceberg admits that much, how
is the Liberal crowd going to justify its
opposition to the amendment of the Constitu-
tion . For surely not eyen the Great Liberal
party will have the courage to contend that
monopolies should be above all Legislative
control If it does it should change' its
name and call itself the Great Anarchist
name ana can itseir tne threat Anarcnist
party.
Again the sturdy, self-reliant backbone of
the country, who is such a whale for Anti-
Socialism. A conference sitting at Sale
(Vic.), the Other day, formulated the follow-
mg demands in connection _with the threat-
ened rabbit invasion of Gippsland :
(1) That the municipalities should be constituted.
an advisory committee to carry out the Vermin De-
struction Act; (2) that a large proportion of the
annual vote be .allotted for expenditure in Gippsland ;
(3) that the Government be asked -to erect , a wire-
'hetting factory to supply landholders with netting at
cost price.
Kn , ’ , , , T , . . ,
. Cocky_ really believes that 1 rivate Enter-
prise IS his friend, why doesn’t he ask it to
do this sort of thing, for a change?
Prof. Herbert Strong, who vacated the
chair of classical philology at the Melbourne
Uni. in 84, has some reminiscences in the
October Arena. His description of Red-
mond Barry, once the Chancellor, is a good
bit of character drawing, lie was an “old-
fashioned Irish gentleman, who might have
stepped out of one of JLever’s novels. .. .a
mighty stickler for etiquette and discipline;
with a powerful will and a winning charm
ot manner which served to raise enthusiasm
in all who came across him. He looked very
grand in his judicial robes on the Bench, and
equally grand in his Chancellor’s robes.”
Strong mentions the amazing evening-dress
fashion which Barry tried to institute in
Melbourne—a blue coat with brass buttons
and knee breeches. It actually did become
the vogue for a little while, but came to an
end, probably because it exposed to public
ridicule the attenuated calves of male
Toorak.
“Radium” on a matter that can stand: —
By way of varying the amusement of suggesting
fancy names for the Federal capital, Gordon, M.H.R.,
successor to the late Labor-Minister Batchelor, is
anxious to iind a name for the Northern Territory.
If we don’t hurry up with the straight railway and
some population to hold it, we might as well name
it New Japan at once, and hand it over to our
Brown Brother as a Christmas box ; but that by the
way. Gordon suggests calling it “Territoria” or
“Centralia,” or “best of all, call it ‘Kingsland.’ ” 1
am prepared to make a present of my bank overdraft
to anyone who can suggest three more idiotic names.
“Territoria” is only territory with a Latin twist in
its tail, and, as every piece of land in the universe
is a territory, or a country, or a State, or a pro-
vince, or an Empire or just plain chaos like the
Balkan Peninsula, we might as well call it any of
these things. “Centralia” is not 'much better, be-
cause the soil in question reaches to the extreme
north, and doesn’t run half-way tp the extreme
south. As for “Kingsland,” although I am a devoted
loyalist, I object, on utilitarian grounds, to haying
“Kingsland” and “Queensland” on the same con-
tinent. There really isn’t room for both. In print
the names are distinct enough, but in sound they
are too nearly alike, and would cause endless con-
fusion. Anyway, the indefinite title of “Kingsland”
doesn’t indicate any particular king, and wouldn’t
do either the King or the country any good. If we
can hold the Northern Territory until 'the people
there are numerous , enough and strong enough to
become a full-blown State on their own, then when
the Federal Parliament hands over to them the most
democratic Constitution on earth, they can take
a referendum on the choice of a name at the same
time as they elect their first members to the Aus-
tralian Parliament.
Another testimonial to the virtues of
Yassberra: —
Recently an ordeij-for a paltry 70,000 super, feet
of hardwood timber,! required for building purposes
at the Federal capital joke, was offered to the one
and only sawmill I; can hear of in the vicinity of
Yassberra. It was? declined by the mill-proprietor
owing to the difficulty of getting enough vegetables
of the size required. This reminds me that when the
Snowy River was in the running, a prominent op-
ponent in the House of Misrepresentatives argued
against Dalgety because of the paucity of hardwoods
in that locality. Yet I can name at least five saw-
mills within easy distance of Dalgety, two of which
have been carving wood off the landscape for more
than 20 years.

The latest product from this factory even excels the high standard
maintained in the past. The Remington-UMC small-bore rifle has many
new and important features. No other rifle on the market has all of
these: —
HAMMERLESS.—No exposed hammer to catch on fence or tree
branch.
SOLID BREECIT. —Eliminates the danger of blow-backs, prevents dirt,
rain, etc., reaching the mechanism. A solid wall of steel between
the cartridge and the shooter’s eyes.
SIDE EJECTION.—The empty shell thrown downward from the side,
away from the line of vision and the shooter’s face.
REPEATING. Makes possible a number of shots in rapid succession
without loss of aim. Takes .22 short, long or long-rifle cartridges
without adjustment.
SAFETY DEVICE.—Locks the mechanism and prevents accidental
discharge when carrying, but ready in an instant for firing when
required.
SIMPLE METHOD OF DETACHING BARREL AND RE-ASSEM-
BLING. No tools needed.
CLEANING FROM THE BREECH.—The breech-block quickly and
easily removed for cleaning barrel from breech.
ACTION.—Smooth, swift and certain.
These features, the beauty of lines and balance, high-grade of
materials used and most skilful and experienced workmanship, place
the Remington-UMC Rifle in a class by itself.

IN
BANANA LAND
The three Queenslanders chosen to run for
the Senate at the next election are Ferricks,
Ryott Maughan and Mullan. Dr. Jensen,
the Commonwealth Geologist at Darwin, was
nominated for selection, but withdrew on
receipt of his appointment. Ferricks is a
young man who has been many things in
Bananaland—miner, editor and cocky
farmer—and sat for Bowen in the last
State Parliament. For attacking Kidston’s
political past he was expelled from the
House for a month. He is a good debater
and a strong Nationalist. Mullan holds a
high position in the State Savings Bank,
As representative of Charters Towers in the
State Parliament, he was looked on as a
keen financial authority. Ryott Maughan
is probably _ the best, known of the trio,
He lost to Jimmy Blair in the last elections
through the Bung-cwm-Wowser vote. Ac-
tive campaigning is to start in February,
and this much can be said of the Banana-
land Labor lot—all the State members are
pledged to whoop a Referendum “Yes.”
AN ALCOHOLIC MARATHON.
BUSINESS MAN: “But why don’tcher set your-
self a limit and not drink one beyond it?”
ARTIST BROKE (suffering recovery): “I do;
but I always get blue-blind before I
reach it!”
By the death of W. W. Develyn, at
Hughenden the other day, Bananaland
squattocracy lost some of its best brains.
Develyn came to Queensland in the early
’Bo’s, and started to squat round about
Hughenden. The drought struck him in
1900, and ever since then he has moved
about the _ State dealing out advice as to
sheep-crossing, wool-classing and similar
subjects. The information Develyn didn’t
have about sheep wasn’t obtainable up
north.
A brilliant suggestion emanated from a
Brisbane stipendiary magistrate over the re-
cent s.s. Aldenliam case, wherein two young
Chinese, coming to Australia as members of
the crew, deserted the vessel in Brisbane,,
and were replaced by two antiquated Geles-' 1
tials who desired to get back to Chowland.
The P.M., commenting on the difficulty of
distinguishing Chinese, remarked : “The only
way I can see is to brand them—but I will
not say where.” If this were done, brand-
faking would be a most flourishing indus-
try in China within six months.
“Platman” : Re a par. relative to Japanese
knowledge of the North Queensland coast.
Of course, the Japs know it. For years they
have been b§che-de-mer fishing from Thurs-
day ‘lsland as far south as Lady Elliott
Island, and they know the Barrier as well
as it can be known. We can’t blot out the
knowledge they have; but we might do a
little to protect Black Sister from them.
Their chief business on the mainland is to
obtain native women (temporarily). The
gins are never taken far to ‘sea, but
after a day or two are put ashore, the bucks
being compensated with rum of a particu-
larly virulent brand. Incidentally, they are
presented with that ghastly prize which-
saved the carpenter in Byron’s shipwreck
from being eaten by his companions. Those
who know the circumstances of the blacks
on the Peninsula grin when they read the
reports of the Chief Protector of Aborigines
and the guileless remarks of the gentleman
who holds the position of Home Sec. and is
ex officio the “little father” of Queensland
niggers.
The Mt. Mulligan railway business pro-
duced a peculiar situation in the Queens-
land Assembly. As the Government is short
of money for building new lines, the Chilla-
goe Co. offered to find about £70,000 for the
construction of this particular connection,
the Commissioner for Railways to work and
fun the line, and the State to take it over at
will. The Denhamites were split up on the
question, several of them voting against the
proposal out of disgust that their own rail-
ways had been put on the shelf. On the
other hand, most of the Labor members, in-
fluenced, doubtless, by the Northern section
of the party, voted enthusiastically for it, in
spite of its syndicate appearance. One of
the funny features of the debate was the
utterance of M.L.A. Barnes, brother of the
Treasurer, who condemned the scheme as
introducing “a distinctly discreditable and
pernicious system of finance” —a piece of
fraternal criticism that deserves to be re-
membered. Several rich and populous farm-
ing districts in the south are now up in open,
rebellion against the present Government on
account of this alleged unfair preference to
the North, and the Labor party is in a very
awkward predicament, for Labor, the prime
enemy of syndicates, has just recorded its- ,
opinion that a district with a rich syndicate
behind it should be accorded preferential
treatment over a rich district that hasn’t got
any syndicate—a remarkable attitude for a
party Q.f syndicate-haters.
In one way the prickly pear-
l's a remarkable advt. for
Queensland. A trifle over 50
years ago it was introduced
into the country wrapped in
cotton wool —on account of its
extreme delicacy. It was
planted out on Yandilla home-
stead, and the gardener who
forgot to water it one day was
sacked for his neglect. A year
ago the tender herb had grabbed
millions of acres, and looked so-
formidable that a Board, con-
sisting'of Steele (Professor of
Chemistry), Analyst Hender-
son, Agricultural Chemist
Brunnich, Entomologist Tryoni
and Botanist Bailey were com-
missioned to advise on its de-
struction. They advised —and
the pear went on. Then Den-
ham got a lady expert who had
an infallible method of exter-
minating the pest. And the
pear went on. Every second,
crank in Bananaland is invent-
ing a machine to slay the mon-
ster —and the monster goes on.
Now Parliament lias taken the 1
thing in hand, though it hasn’t the ghost of
an idea what to do with it,
“Don Q.”: Minister Barnes is making-
efforts to sell the dredge Samson, which lias;
been lying unemployed in Brisbane River
for years, to the Australian Government. It
cost something like £lOO,OOO to build, and
about £5OOO in repairs during the six months;
it was in commission. The Federal authorities;
offered to lease the curiosity from Barnes,,
but that astute gent;, wasn’t having any trial
spins. He said in the Assembly the other
day that the Samson was a splendid dredge,
but that the Hercules could do all the work
required in the river. Just about the same
time a new made-in-Germany dredge-
(£47,ooo) appeared on the scene and an-
chored in the river. I’ll put it that Barnes;
was mistaken. But if Prime Minister Fisliei-
buys the Samson lie’ll be mistaken more.
The Tale of the Conquered.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In Egypt standeth a mighty stone
Planted firm o’er a burial grot;
High in the desert it tow’retli lone,
And this is the message its symbols own:
“We Avere beaten and overthrown”
(This is the tale of the mighty stone)
“They Avere ready and we Avere not !*’
A pillar risetli in far Cathay,
Lone and drear in a wasted spot—-
“Here there flourished,” its carvings say,
“A people gallant and proud and gay,
Who laughed and quaffed, and who passed
away,
For” (saitli the pillar in far Cathay)
“Foes Avere ready but they were not.”
A graven rock do the Persians show,
Telling all of a folk forgot,
Who danced and sang with the wine a-flow,
And cared no whit for the winter’s snow,
But fell one night by a vengeful foe
(As the graven rock and the Persians
show)
One was ready and one Avas not.
And so doth the Taie of the Conquered run—-
“High and mighty was once our lot •
An Empire proud had we nobly won
With manhood, valor and sword and gun ;
But, lo! it perished at set of sun,
For” (so doth the Tale of the Conquered
run)
“They were ready and we were not!”
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, November 30, 1912.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
Another empty week which the bon ton has
been hard put to it to fill with odd parties,
the war whoops of musical unions and such
scratch events. So different from height-of-
season doings, my dear.
On Monday, Miss Astronomer Mary Proc-
tor lectured in the Palace Gardens under a
canopy of moisture. A rather dull-looking
constellation in the front seats included the
Macgregor (in a felt hat), while various
members of the Royal Geographical Societv
obscured their radiance in the background
under top-coats. Miss Proctor’s measured
voice, which, without being loud, succeeds in
reaching every corner of her chosen lecture
place, is a great asset. About 200 school
children sat in the middle aisle on Monday
night, but they weren’t the ones who giggled
when Miss Proctor mentioned that she and
another well-known stargazer (of the oppo-
site sex) had foregathered at three o’clock
one morning to look at a comet. How is it,
Thargomindah, that we always giggle when
we hear the after-hours man mentioned?
The Highland sports were in full swing at
the Exhibition to-day, andl ©n Thursday even-
ing the clans swarmed at Webster’s Majestic
to eat St. Andrew’s health 1 - The Macgregor
chieftaim occupied the top of the table, and
seemed particularly fascinated by a brawny
specimen of the Camefon tribe, who appeared
in proper Highland evening f-dress. The
haggis was led round the table to the skirl
of the sporran, but no one excepting the hard-
boiled Scots would wrestle with it. There
were not many h.-b. Scots present. I sus-
pected that most of them came from Too-
woomba, and even at Toowoomba nowadays
a bonnie lassie is merely a boshter tart.
The new Methodist College, in connection
with the chrysalis University, was labori-
ously pushed off by George V.’s official chair-
warmer to-day. The affair was chiefly
noticeable for its amount of dreary speechi-
fying. '
The two Conran girls, who are cousins to
Adolph Feez’s pretty, red-haired daughters,
were guests of, the German Crown Prince
and Princess, at .Danzig, in October. Both
girls are experts with skates, -bobsleighs and
other strenuous toys, and have been wel-
comed at the Crown Prince’s gunvah on sev-
eral occasions for winter sports.
John Bull’s papers duly chronicle the do-
ings of the two smart Buckland Taylor girls,
who are at present in London with their
mother. Mrs. Gerald Hanbury, who is also
in London, maintains a reputation for smart
dressing, and Jose Metcalfe, of Toowoomba,
is hailed by Fogland critics as a beauty.
So somebody’s beginning to sit up and take
a bit of notice.
Mrs. A. J. Boyd, one of our oldest and
most ardent charity workers, celebrated her
golden wedding yesterday. Major Boyd’s
pals at the United Service Institute gave
him pipes and other simple playthings of
mere man. The Anglican Synod, for
which the lady has battled hard since before
the memory of the oldest inhabitant failed,
forwarded much metal, and other tokens.
Also, some 120 variegated charity commit-
tees rose to an occasion which was worthy
of the exertion.
Miss Lorna Hopkins, step-daughter of the
late poet, Essex Evans, was married on
Wednesday to the Rev. Thompson, who is
busy shepherding the Anglican souls at
New Farm. The Orient liner Osterley con-
ducted the pair to Sydney. _ The Blue
Mountains will be included in the pro-
gramme, after which the newly-wed will re-
turn to the heart-breaking job of separating
the few spiritual sheep from the vast herd
of irreligious goats.
Lulu Horsman, of Mosman, in your dread-
fully cold State, has conspired matrimoni-
ally with journalist Kelly, who edits and
partly owns the Gatton MAil.
Yours, from the congregation of Fashion,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
In the year 1903 Queensland lia-.d 52 in-
spectors in the Agricultural Department; to-
day it carries 116. The Department of Works
in 1906 employed 12 inspectors; to-dav it is
served by no fewer than 52: No wonder the
State is crying out for immigrants. Some-
body must do the washing up.
“Politicus” : Brisbane quidnuncs are reviv-
ing an old yarn that Denham hairbors the
design of seizing the Agent-Generalship and
having a spell in London. The same canard
was circulated about Arthur Morgan and
Kidston. The fact is, none of these politi-
cians want, or ever wanted, to vegetate in
the Fog, owing to the infatuation of all of
them for the Queensland climate. A man can
get as fond of salubrious air as he can of
non-salubrious drink.
Discussing the question, “When is a boiler
unfit for use?” one M.L.A. told the Assem-
bly the other day that he had seen a traction,
engine driven 20 miles with mud stuffed in,
the holes of its holier!
According to Protector of Aborigines;
Howard, in certain far-Northern districts,
when a blackfellow dies, his body is buried!
for two or three days, whereupon the grave-
ls opened and the decomposed flesh is takem
up, some of it being eaten and other parts
of it rubbed over the hands and face. Howard
tells of one nigger humorist who, when tor-
tured by toothache, attributed the trouble
to “too much blackfellow.”
DONALDSON , ARCHBISHOP OF
BRISBANE.
Lawyers can do almost anything. “Lands”
Macartney, who is a member of one of
Brisbane’s oldest six-and-eight firms, has
just brought in a Bill “to amend the Mar-
supial Proof Fencing Act of 1898 by en-
larging the definition of marsupials so as-
to include dingoes.” Evidently Macartney’s;
idea is that even if you can’t make a purse-
out of a sow’s ear you can make a pouch
out of a member of Parliament’s Aye.
The little six-and-eightpenny souls of
some Queensland lawyers are very perturbed
these times. The Brisbane shark has a
habit of binding those who are articled to
him not to start in local practice for a
specific number of years after being duly
licensed to also be sharks; and a Bill has
been introduced to make the infamous pro-
vision illegal, and to permit the new shark
to hang out his shingle in whatever town he
likes. Although it is practically a Govern-
ment measure, the two lawyers in the Cab-
inet are having the professional screw put on
them to oppose it.
In one way the prickly pear.is a remark-
able advt. for Queensland. A trifle over 50
years ago it was introduced into the country
wrapped in cotton wool—on account of its
extreme delicacy. It was planted out on
Yandilla homestead, and the gardener who
forgot to water it one day was sacked for
his neglect. A year ago the tender herb had
grabbed millions of acres, and looked so for-
midable that a Board, consisting of Steele
(Professor of Chemistry), Analyst Hender-
son, Agricultural Chemist Brunnich, Ento-
mologist Tryon and Botanist Bailey were
commissioned to advise on its destruction.
They advised —and the pear went on. Then
Denham got a lady expert who had an infal-
lible method of exterminating the pest.
And the pear went on. Every second crank
In Bananaland is inventing a machine to slay
the monster —and the monster goes on. Now
Parliament has taken the thing in hand,
though it hasn’t the ghost of an idea what
to do with it.
The general servant is usually the best-abused mem-
ber of the household, because she cannot do every-
thing equally well. Serubb’s Fluid Ammonia is a
general servant that escapes this opprobrium. It
does everything equally well. It cleans paint per-
fectly, takes stains out of clothes absolutely, allays
inflammation from insect bites and stings immedi-
ately, and restores the exhausted frame thoroughly.
These are its chief merits; like all brilliant suc-
cesses, it has its sidelights, which only housekeepers
—who all swear by it —know.

Hero is a
Proposition
The Melotte
Separator is
placed on the
market at a cost
slightly above
that of tli£
average cream
separator.
The
Result
The Melotte
has the largest
sale in the
British Empire,
and an annually
increasing one.
The
Conclusion
If the price
is above the
average, the de-
sign, materials,
workmanship,
and construc-
tion, must be
incalculably
above the aver-
age; otherwise
this enormous
sale would be
impossible.
The
Secret
lies in the fad that
once installed,
the Melotte
produces an
increased yield
of the best
cream and butter
throughout a
lifetime of con-
stant use with
practically no
further outlay
for upkeep.

Cryptic whisper by S. M. Herald the
other day: —
There are reasons why the Government must get
into recess at a very early date. Strained relations with
Mr. Willis furnished one reason, and there are other
reasons, which the press is not at liberty to mention.
If it’s mortial remains they’ve dispoged of,
out with them, Sairey !
The will of F. W. Prell, of Toorak (Vic.),
merchant, who died on April 27, has jbeen
proved at £91,630 real and £11,974 personal.
With Mr. Prell’s will was also lodged the
will of his wife, who died in 1904. The lady
left an estate valued at £29,623 real and
£1062 personal to her husband for life, and
afterwards to the children. Prell was one
of the oldest merchants in Melbourne. He
was in Sydney in the first ’so’s, having come
out to join Herman Haege, merchant, of
Jamieson-street. The firm became Haege and
Prell, of Sydney and Melbourne, Mr. Prell
eventually taking complete charge of the
latter branch of the business.
Apparently the King smelt something the other
day, and decided to appoint somebody manufacturer
of disinfectants to his Majesty. Naturally. New-
town, Chambers and Co., Ltd., got the job. The
firm has had 120 years experience, and nowadays
employes 6000 neople, most of. them directly or
indirectly in the production of Izal —that “worthy
and formidable weapon for battling against the
bacillus,” as the famous Dr. Crichton-Bi'owne - called
it lately.*

The “isolation” practised at Melbourne’s
Infectious Diseases Hospital seems to be as
farcical in some particulars as it is thorough
in others. Some parents, it was alleged at the
current inquiry, weren’t allowed to see their
dying children, even though they offered to
undergo fumigation or disinfection and
quarantine afterwards; yet nurses and other
employees passed in and out without so much
as changing their garments. An “outside
painter was employed adorning the buildings
for three weeks last Christmas, and went to
and from his home daily in the same suit and
without disinfection. Also, several patients
seem to have at various times departed un-
noticed. One lady climbed the fence with
the assistance of her husband, went home,
got a certificate of sound health from the
family doctor, and defied the hospital
authorities. Another patient, allegedly suf-
fering from scarlet fever, found himself so
fit, but so weary of it all, that after nine
days’ detention he casually scaled the fence
and went about his business; and that was
the last he heard of it. Between the patients
who die and are forgotten while still un-
buried, and the patients who are. still im-
proving” while dead and buried, and the
patients who are “rather worse” Wo ugh they
have never been in the institution at all. and
the patients who are operated on and die
afterwards,, and those who die first and aie
operated on afterwards, and the patients who
leap the fence casually and are heard of no
more, the institution seems to have lost its
grip of things, so to sneak. By the way, the
gentleman who scaled the fence forgot one
thing. He should have rung up the hospital
next mornirlg and inquired after his health.
He would almost certainly have been assured
that he was “still improving.”

One of the numerous Boards of Inquiry ap-
pointed by Premier Watt, to save his Gov-
ernment the fag of using what brains Nature
gave it, started the other day inquiring into
the disposal of silt in Port Phillip Bay and
its effect on fish. The Board and the inquiry
are both superfluous. The silt is clearly
lirought down from inland by the Yarra
waters, and if the mullock is continually
dredged up from the lower river and de-
nosited in the bay, inevitably the bay will be
filled up sooner or later. In the first 10
months of this year the quantity of silt
mechanically spilled into the bay was
131,000 tons; so the filling-up promises to
arrive with some suddenness. Anyhow, as
it is, the bay isn’t deep enough for the big
boats now building, and to make it less deep
is folly. Also, it is expensive folly, inasmuch
as there is not one penny of profit in the
performance, whereas if the stuff were
dumned on to the low-lying. State-owned laud
at Fisherman’s Bend and the West Mel-
bourne Swamn those properties would be
available as sites for factories, warehouses,
grain stores, and so forth, and would bring
in a tidy revenue to the State. Even if the
silt cost a bit to place there, the State would
still be in pocket, for it would have some-
thing to show for its money, whereas at
present it has nothing excent an unpleasant
smell and the remains of a. few dead fish.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It. fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
p<o
&<?
KCP
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least dinger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t deiay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

ForSkinTroubles. Her Hands Rough
and Itching, Had to Wear Gloves
Night and Day, Could Not Take
Cases. Used Cuticura Soap and
Ointment, A Complete Cure,
“It is now more than twelve months since
the skin on my hands became rough and
itching. I tried simple dressings and several
w
patent ointments, but they
only eased them for a time.
If I did any washing the
acute irritation afterwards
was terrible. It would
wake me up at night. The
roughness of the skin turned
to deep cuts. I have had
to wear gloves night arid
day for a long time. I had
to stay at home for a whole
month and not take cases,
because the disinfectants I
used in my profession only
aggravated the irritation.
“I sent away for several samples of dif-
ferent cures at different times, but until I
got Cuticura Ointment and Soap I had no
real relief. After using the sample box of
Cuticura Ointment my hands became easier,
but they had been bad for so long and the
cuts were so very deep that I had to use four
boxes of Cuticura Ointment before I had a
complete cure. I began to think they never
would be right again, and if I had not per-
severed with Cuticura Ointment they never
would. When I have been at my cases, I
have shown them to several doctors and have
had ointment from them, but I only had
temporary relief. I shall only be too pleased
to recommend the Cuticura Remedies
wherever I come across any skin troubles.”

Marvellous Discovery
By Great German Scientist.
NO MORE DANGEROUS MOSQUITO BITES.
After one application of ‘‘MOSQUITOLINE” no mosquito or other insect will trouble vou Protected
by this wonderful liquid, you can even sleep in the open without a net. Mosquitoes will shun von m
you would shun the plague. Quite agreeable to human beings, but obnoxious to all insects “ y
THE DISCOVERY.
The world owes much to the
researches of that well-known
scientist—Dr. Gunther, who
has for many years labored
in Central Africa and India
in order to discover a potent
compound that will combat
the deadly Mosquito. At last
these years of effort have been
crowned with success, and he
has produced a very pungent,
although pleasant, liquid that
repels Mosquitoes and other
insects as though they had
been shot from a gun. This
liquid he has named “MOS-
QUITOLINE.” It is quite
harmless to human beings
and animals, but insects can-
not live near it. :
FOE TO INSECTS.
MOSQUITOLINE not only re-
pels the attacks of mosqui-
toes, but gives absolute pro-
tection against stings and
bites of Wasps, Ants, Gnats,
Bugs, Fleas and Flies. After
one application you will be
completely immune from the
attention of these pests.
DR. PAUL GUNTHER.
DANGER OF BITES.
It is common knewledge that
mosquitoes carry such death-
dealing germs as Malaria,
Marsh Fever and Ague, and
every time they bite there is
the possibility of infection,
which may lead to serious
illness. MOSQUITOLINE will
protect you from the ravages
of disease, even though you
sleep without nets in the
worst malarial districts.
LIFE WORTH LIVING.
With the discovery of MOS-
QUITOLINE, life is now pos-
sible in all parts of the
world where mosquitoes pre-
viously held complete sway.
One can now sleep in the
open without stuffy nets or
curtains, and during the day
attend to work —even though
the region is swarming with
insect life. MOSQUITOLINE
is positively invaluable where
insects have been wont to
make life unbearable.
HOW TO OBTAIN A SUPPLY.
MOSQUITOLINE is sold in bottles at 3/6 each, three bottles for 9/6, or six bottles for 18/-,
postage free, and can only be obtained from the Sole Agents — -it cannot be obtained else-

The cable-man set Australian papers a puzzle over
the Ourran and Synott scrap in London, where the
referee stepped in and stopped a one-sided affair
in the second round. A few hours after sending the
bare result, he cabled, “Fight stopped on humani-
tarian grounds.’’ Adelaide Express (14/11/’l2)

“Looking Backward”: W. J. Sowden, of S. Aus.
Register, in his just published book, calls Catherine
Helen Spence, who died in 1910, “the greatest Aus-
tralian woman.” There is a good deal to justify the
title. Melbourne Argus blames Sowden for omitting
to mention that it was this lady who wrote the first
novel in Australia. Wrong. Miss Spence wrote, in
1853, “Clara Morison, a Tale of South Australia
During the Gold Fever,” and it was published in ’54
by J. W. Parker and Son. The authoress sold it for
£4O, but as it was too long for the series in which
it was to be issued, she was charged £lO for the
abridging of it. Twenty-three years previously the
first novel issued in Australia was published in
Hobart. It was. written by a convict, and only two
copies are known —one in the Petherick collection
and one in a private library in Hobart.

“B.B.”: The inevitable is about to deliver itself
in Sydney in the shape of a news syndicate, and
there is some anxiety amongst inky wayfarers as to
how many men may be out of a shop in consequence.
As a matter of fact, there is not likely to be a great
deal of difference, although had it not been for the
refusal of one of the evening papers to do business
on syndicate lines, there would have been consider-
able gaps in the inky ranks. The decision of the
Sun upset the syndicate’s plans to no small extent.
With a smart staff working against the pool system,
;here is every prospect of a news agency being
‘scooped” with painful regularity. Naturally, staff
aen on all papers would see the agency’s men con-
iemned before they would assist them in any way;
and, if the agency was going to operate in an ex-
tensive way, it might have to rush on to its staff
actually more men than were fired from the papers
it was expected to feed. For instance, it would be
compelled to have more men in the courts than
three of the newspapers have now. It is no unusual
thing for a morning paper man to have five, six, and
even seven courts to look after, and, of course, he
can manage the job, or herd of jobs, only by the
grace of the reporters representing other papers.
But there would be no grace for the agency; in fact,
if it merely so much as turned its back on a job
for 10 minutes a scoop would be snapped on it, even
if that scoop had to be manufactured. The joy of
harrowing a news agency in its most vulnerable spot
would add a new flavor to life.

“B. de B.” : Be the new Irish degree of Master of
Journalism (B. 14/11/’l2), I have no fancy ideas
about the value of initials after pressmen’s names,
but I do think a specialised education would be a
good thing. Therefore, I suggest a chair of jour-
nalism in each of the universities. It is good re-
porters that are wanted in Australia. Editing calls
for only two talents —a knowledge of the public
pulse-beat and the gift of organisation; and sub-edit-
ing needs only callousness. But the big dailies to-
day are shrieking for capable reporters—men of good
education, fast shorthand and longhand writers,
judicious condensers, bright stylists, men with
newsy noses and fresh ideas. A University course
would not produce all these qualities, but it would
stimulate some of them. The curriculum might em-
brace French and German, shorthand, English and
French literature, political history (leaving political
economy to look after itself), general history and a
little course of Greek and Latin. Anybody compar-
ing the rank-and-file work of the Australian press
must at once admit that it is at least as good as
the work done in England; but, all the same, there
is room for improvement, and while the demand for
good men is increasing, the supply isn’t. De Blowitz,
i who was a reporter all his life, always favored a
I special college education for the journalist. He in-
cluded in his curriculum boxing, riding and revolver
shooting. “The science of arms, so-called,” he said,
“should be rigorously interdicted, because a man
obliged to support his arguments by weapons, or
who indulges in personalities, which place, so to
speak, arms in the hands of his foes, is neither a
journalist nor worthy to be one.” Some years ago
President Thwing, of the Cleveland (Ohio) Univer-
sity, wrote to the leading editors in various States,
asking for advice as to a school of journalism. He
got a lot of advice, but none of the editors believed
in a school of the kind. Editor Lodkin, of N’Yawk
Evening Post, said: “What reporters need most is
a good general education, more especially in history,
political economy and constitutional law.” The Pre-
sident noted sadly that none of the editors pleaded
for Latin and Greek. They’re not wanted here,
either; except the merest rudiments. I now beg to
j move that in Sydney Monty Grover take the chair of
! journalism, and that in Melbourne Jack Davidson be
I elected. If their papers are embarrassed by their
I leaving, I am ready to take the billet of either of
i them.
SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Song is the —bless me! What on earth is song?
I write this wearily, within the reach
Of one who works, and wails the liveday long.
Would that he’d idle, and forget to screech!
Song is the untaught—h’m, the untaught whatT
Truly, ’tis often very much untaught.
’Tis the expression... .Yes, that means a 10t....
Untutored squeezings of unnurtured thought.
That sounds well, likewise, but it isn’t true;
Thought isn’t in it when the lungs are good.
Squeeze an old bottle when the wine is new,
Press a new skin, wherein the liquor’s crude,
Let a new flask, unbroken, overflow.
Break an old flagon, and let out the lees,
Or overturn a brimming cantaro —
These be expressions, if excursions these.
Maybe, the billow from a bursting dam ;
Some time the trickle from a leaking pail;
A rushing torrent, or a dripping dram;
A howling paean, or a sobbing wail.
So that it’s fluid, and it flows unchecked;
So that it runs, unguided, where it may;
So that its stream, regardless of effect
Issues, unstrained, unstinted, any way!
Song is. .. .I’ve said what song is, at some length,
And little definition. Leave it thus,
Life’s uttered wine of varied age and strength,
And worth and virtue still more various.
Song is not always music, nor the stuff
That we call wine deserving of the name;
Sure, what is in this pitcher’s proof enough,
And yon wild yelling demonstrates the same
The ring of metal in the village forge,
Heard on the hill, is music; and the beat
Of panting engines, echoing through the gorge,
And far-off voices in the village street.
Now we are off the subject. What’s the odds?
Returning were as tedious as going o’er.
One more libation to our little gods,
And....over goes the pitcher on the floor.

But remember! there’s no two ways about it — Ingersoll must be on
the dial of the watch you buy, if you want to GET YOUR MONEY'S
WORTH. ♦
The Jewelled Trenton Watch offers the same security and saving to the buyer in
high-grade watches that the Ingersoll does in the low-priced class. Prices from 30/-
upwards. If you have any difficulty in obtaining an Ingersoll or Trenton Watch, write
us for name of nearest dealer.

ONE of the best proofs of R-C-H
value is the number of buyers
who heretofore have been
driving cars costing from to
And there’s a good reason for it. You
get in the R-C-H the utmost in comfort,
in looks and in strength. You get power
sufficient to take you and your family
wherever you want to go, and faster
than you’ll ever want to drive. You get
an economy of operation impossible in
the high-priced car. You get complete
equipment of the best quality. And you
save from £lOO to £2OO.
The easiest way to prove these things
is to let us demonstrate the R-C-H to
you. We’ll do it whenever you’re readv.
And we’re perfectly willing to abide by
your judgment.

STRENGTH GOMES
not from What You Eat,
but from What You Digest.
Take one
TWENTY MINUTES
BEFORE.
Most people eat all kinds of food without
discrimination. Few stop to think what that
food does for them. This is the first turn on
the road to dyspepsia. Reckless disregard of
the proper choice of foods, rapid eating and
improper mastication are the unquestioned
causes of all stomach disorders.
There is nothing more revolting than a
dyspeptic stomach—the very vat for putrefac-
tion —sending forth its poisons throughout
the entire system, depressing the brain, be-
fouling the breath, souring the taste, deaden-
ing the muscles, incapacitating the liver and
kidneys for their work, debilitating the
heart, choking the lungs, and clogging the
bowels.
All of these disagreeable and dangerous condi-
tions are due to the improper digestion of food
and the consequent assimilation of poison. What
else can be expected? If the food lies in the
stomach, if the system is constipated, fermenta-
tion is the natural outcome. It shows itself in
sour water risings, belchings, heartburn and pain-
ful breathing.
There is only one way to relieve this condition.
If the stomach refuses to digest your food, put
something into it that will. Dr. Sheldon’s Diges-
tive Tabules are nothing but digestives. They
work when the stomach will not.
These TABULES are sold everywhere at 1/6 for a tin containing 36 Tabules,
or 2/6 for a tin containing EIGHTY TABULES. Buy a tin, eat a good square
meal, and then take the TABULES according to directions, and note the result.
You will forget all about it if you are not careful, for there will be NO PAIN or
disturbance, and the food will be DIGESTED just as it used to be when your
STOMACH was WELL and STRONG. Furthermore, your stomach will soon be
restored again, if you keep on taking them, just as thousands upon thousands of
other stomachs have been by the sole and exclusive use of DR. SHELDON’S
DIGESTIVE TABULES.

The Lay of the Last Shellback.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, for a bold sou’-wester from the
hefty days gone by,
When I sailed the seas of all the
world that heave beneath the skv!
Boy in the Marco Polo, mate in the Cutty
Sark,
Master first in the old Superb, and now, like
Noah’s Ark,
Stranded, bilged and useless, weak of eye
as of knee,
Strapped like a doll in this chair on wheels
to dream of the living sea.
Oh, for the sweet sou’-easters that lisp
where the trade winds blow,
When the waves are blue as a maiden’s eye,
and the clouds like the drifted snow !
Oh, for the swirl ’neath the counter, and
the clear tune whistling through
The canvas kissed by the freshing breeze, in
the strong, full days we knew!
Mfist .1 part with the breath of my body
where the clanging tram-bells ring,
And never hear, with the lifting swell, the
song that the sea winds sing?
Let me get back to the life I knew, to the
shout of the nor’-west gale,
To live one hour of the days gone by, With
the ice on the frozen sail,
To watch the clipper ships drive east, with
wool and pelts and grain,
At fourteen knots from sea to sea. through
mist and snow and rain!
Let me hear the long spars straining, and
the grip of the royal’s luff.. . .
To hear it again.... I’d live a week.... and
drink this doctor’s stuff.
Lord, send me back to the good old sea. I
cannot die in the din
Of the tram-poles screaming along the wires,
and the folk going out and in.
There’s charts galore in the chest downstairs
of every sea I know,
And all I want is to hear the course before
I go below.
Then I’ll drink this stuff without a growl,
and leave the rest to You
To “pick her off” or “conn her on” as a
sailor’s God should do.

The Treason of the King’s
Daughter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OFTENTIMES had I heard it said
that the faith of a woman is weaker
than the trust one setteth in red
wine. Yet in my youth and strength did I
dream myself wise above the wisdom of the
old men.
I stood behind the throne of the Great
King, and the royal maiden went unveiled
before us, clothed with that sweetness which
made her as the lily among the thorns of
which I had once heard a harper of Jezreel
sing. I, too, had made my song to the glory
of her beauty, a beauty marvellous as the
sunset over Salamis on that fair evening
when I sailed away from my own land.
For five years I had dwelt among the
bearded men of the City of Judah, walking
in the king’s favor, and in the scorn of his
courtiers and wise men. I was an alien
and a stranger, and sometimes the longing
to hear again the speech of Attica filled me
with a great pain to be among the white-
limbed lonian people. But the king’s daugh-
ter went and came before me, and for the love
I bore her I lingered on in Jerusalem.
Yet well I knew that the daughters of
Jerusalem wedded not the sons of other
lands, and that such a fever as burned in
my veins at the sight of her beauty must
burn itself out in vain. Moreover, was she
not the child of a palace, and I but the hire-
ling within the gate? Often had she smiled
upon me, and it was strange and sweet to
hear her try to frame my own name upon
lips so unused to the sounds of our speech.
As Aristomenes had I been known in Attica,
and by that name sometimes she sought to
call me, but to the king, her father, I was
ever known as Benomen. For two years I
had been in ward of her apartments in the
palace, and when she went abroad in the
city or to the gardens beyond I was chief
of the troop that went before her. For the
royal maiden went openly, and had joy of
the sunlight and flowers; and her father, in
all save the great matters of state, was
obedient to her will.
Oftentimes in crossing the stream which
they called Kedron she commanded me to take
her hand and lead her over the stones; and
with the vanity of youth I dreamed that she
took pleasure in the goodly person of the
foreign captain whose face and mien were
so unlike those of her own people. Those
were times of much dreaming, for the list-
less days of the summer were long and
idle ; and though many rumors of war came
t.o us from Egypt and the coasts of Tyre
and Sidon, and though the little cities of
Judah had been burned with fire and the
land wasted by the Assyrian, yet Jerusalem
remained unharmed by any foe.
But on that evening when the princess
Judith went before the king, all the court
held its breath for fear, waiting for the
runner who should bring tidings of the battle
in the south. ■ The wide curtains about the
doorway swung in the breeze, and the last
sunlight falling upon the pillars of the great
temple turned their bronze covering to gold.
The wise men about the king walked to and
fro. unable to contain themselves with pati-
ence, and the princes and courtiers whis-
pered together; but Hezekiah the king sat
with his head bowed on his hand.
Then there arose a shout by the city gate,
and all the men of the palace stood upon
their feet; and the royal maiden clapped
her hands together until her gold armlets
rang like cymbals, and cried aloud: “Be-
hold, the runner cometh, and I know hy his
mien that he bringeth good tidings! ’
And as she spoke, I saw across the red
light that the sun made in the dust of the
way a man running, and a great concourse
of people following after. But the greater
part stayed at the outer pillars of the king s
court, and the runner came on, breathing
hard, and fell prostrate on the steps of the
king’s seat. , ~ ,
Whereat there arose a noise of wrath and
dismay from those behind like the barking
of dogs, and somewhere voices were heard
wailing as over the dead.
But the runner, yet panting hard, cried
aloud: “O King, live for ever! All is lost
The Assyrian hath driven Tirhaka and all
his host 'in flight across the desert, and even
now the chariots and horsemen ot feenna-
eherib march upon the city.”
Then King Hezekiah rent his clothes,
and threw dust upon his head, and called
aloud upon his God; and the wise men
and princes of state fell upon the ground
and grovelled upon the mats and rugs ot the
palace. But the multitude with torches and
lamps came into the gathering darkness of
the palace itself, and shook their fists at the
king, and called down curses upon him for
the evil thing that must soon befall the city.
But I, seeing that there was none to give
orders to stay the tumult, drew my sword
and called upon the guard of the palace to
make a wall about the royal maiden and her
father. There were 20 men of all nations
under Heaven who came at my call, and
together we fell upon the people and drove
them backward, not without some blood-
shed ; and the great doors wete closed upon
the tumult.
Then, while yet the sword was drawn in
my hand, the royal maiden came to me, and
clung upon my arm. and looked upon me
with eyes that had no fear. For the space
of a heart-beat she stood thus, and no man
had regard to Us ; but the blood sang in my
veins, for I had done a man’s deed, and a
woman looked upon me with praise.
But the king was overwhelmed with great
fear, and all the wise men of the court
seemed helpless before the blow that, must
fall upon them. Egypt, on whom they
relied, was as a broken reed, and in all the
lands of the East there was nothing remain-
ing which the king of Assyria coveted ex-
cept the single city of .Jerusalem. More-
over, the men of Judah were few and weak
in fight, and Sennacherib counted his soldiers
by 10-score thousands, and his horses and
chariots were many as the stones of the city.
So, while yet the tumult raged without,
and the king and his wise men wept and
bewailed, I bore the Princess Judith to her
own apartments on the western wall where
her maidens awaited her.
From the wide upper porch which over-
looked the stairway which is called Solo-
mon’s I could see the city aflame with
torches and fires, and hear the hum of many
voices, for a great madness of despair had
fallen upon the people. And while many
wept and bewailed their evil state, _ there
were more who brought forth the skins of
wine as at a festival, so that the noise of revel
drowned the cries of those who lamented.
And as I watched and listened, the noise
and the lights grew arid increased, and men
and women mingled together in the streets,
drinking from cups and flagons, and shout-
ing against their God and the king, until it
seemed that the whole city had resolved with
one mind to hold carnival of folly before the
Assyrian should come to batter down the
gates.
So I turned about and walked the length
of the corridor before the chambers of the
princess and her maidens, and found there
Shunan, the Edomite, and an Ethiopian of
great stature, both soldiers of my guard,
standing at their post and untroubled by the
noise of the uproar without. Straightway
I gave them command to let none so much as
enter the great archway at the stairhead
save he bore a word from the king him-
self, but to smite even to the death any
who should seek to pass.
Then, leaving my men with their weapons
ready, I set my hand to the hilt of my
sword and passed down the stairway into
the tumult of the city.
Beyond the palace buildings lay the Castle
of Zion, where were 500 men of all nations,
soldiers and mercenaries, who might fight
for the king at his need; and I sought to
pass over to these that I might learn from
the captain of the garrison if all went well:
for it seemed that the madness of some of
the people might before morning provoke an
assault upon the palace itself.
So I went among the lights and the throng
until I came to the darkness by the outer
gate of the castle. There one accosted me
whom I knew as great and honorable, and
but lately high in favor with the king. He
was a man young in years, but great in
knowledge, and as he laid his hand upon my
shoulder I was glad, for he seemed to me
even as Odysseus, who might by his wisdom
save the people against their will. His
name was Isaiah, and he was strong and
goodly to look upon as the chiefs of my own
nation.
“Whither goest thou, Benomen?” he said.
“The night is full of danger, and it were
well that a soldier stand to his ward.”
“I go to seek the captain of the castle
guard,” I made answer, “for the night is in-
deed full of madness, and we have no
strength to defend the palace of the king
against so great a multitude as these who
shout treason upon his name.”
“Return, O my son,” replied the man of
state. “There shall no great evil befall the
house of the king. Before morning there
shall be much blood spilled upon the thres-
holds of this sinful people, but the king
shall none harm. Yea, and the host of the
Assyrian shall fail from before the city, for
our God hath spoken it. Return, but keep
thy sword ready in thine hand: for who
knoweth what good or what evil is in store
for thee?”
Even as he spoke I heard behind me a
shouting from the upper windows of the
palace, and turning about saw many lights
that flared fitfully through the lattice. Back
through the crowded streets I ran, with my
sword drawn ready in my hand, and the
multitude of people parted to right and left
tp give me passage; though some there were
who cried curses upon me as a stranger and
an alien.
The stairway of Solomon lay in shadow,
but when I gained the upper porch I saw by
the light of a fallen torch that Shunan the
Edomite lay dead across the doorway of the
royal maiden’s apartment, and that the
Ethiopian stood over him sore wounded and
fighting valiantly against a rabble of the
baser sort, who had entered the palace with
intent to plunder. Then I shouted the
battle-cry that I had learned in Phocis and
laid about me for the moment like the son of
Telamon. Within the space of time in
which a man might buckle on his armor the

AN ENGINEER’S
TERRIBLE BURNS
GREAT RUNNING SORES CLEANED AND HEALED BY ZAM-BUK
AFTER MANY SO-CALLED REMEDIES PROVE USELESS.
«3»»»
SS£^,'
Mr. P. W’ALTER, who sp
in praise of Zam-Buk
THE smarting, stinging pain is quickly
subdued by the prompt application of
Zam-Buk. Mr. P. Walter, of 108
North Terrace, Adelaide, S.A., who is an
engineer, says“ I sustained a severe
burn on my arm by coming in contact with
the side of a furnace. The injury caused
me intense pain. The wound became in-
flamed, and soon was in a terrible state.
Complications set in, and festers started,
and the inflammation increased. 1 applied
many well-known remedies, but things
grew worse.
“ Little blisters formed, which gradually
merged to great running sores, from which
matter flowed freely. My arm was in a
very bad state when a friend recommended
Zam-Buk. I followed his advice and felt a
soothing sensation after the first few appli-
cations. The excessive pain ceased and the
burning inflammation died away. I con-
tinued with Zam-Buk until the wound was
completely healed, and I was able to use
my arm again. Since that time 1 have
often used Zam-Buk for burns, knocks and
cuts, and it has not failed me once.”
Everybody’s Ever-Ready Healer.
Zam-Buk is
invaluable
for all
eczema,
ulcers, ring-
worm, piles,
bad legs,
and quickly
heals cuts,
scratches,
burns,
scrapes,
knocks and
bruises.
Always

and stores
sell it at

THERE’S
NOTHING
LIKE
ZAM-BUK.
The boon Zam-Buk was to Mr. Walter is due entirely
to the scientific composition of this healing: prepara-
tion, which must not be confused with the cheap
salves and coarse ointments that no amount of
rubbing: will force into the pores of the skin. These
ointments are, at best, merely toilet articles, and of
not the least medicinal value. There is wisdom and
economy in buying Zam-Buk, because the ailments
Zam-Buk combats are printed on its sealed package,
and Zam-Buk does all that it claims to do.

Colic, Diarrhoea and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle” of Chamberlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

11 1 am pleased to say that I have found Chamberlain’s
Tablets a wonderful remedy for biliousness, sick head-
ache and pains in the kidneys. I suffered many a day
and night from these complaints until one day I saw
Chamberlain’s Tablets advertised in the paper for the
cure of biliousness and thought I would give them a
trial. I am pleased to say that they gave such
satisfaction that I feel a new woman since taking them.
I cannot say too much about Chamberlain’s Tablets.
I have recommended them to others and they would not
be without them now for any money. ’ ’
Mrs. Edith Wall, Clermont, Q.
bead of the stairway was cumbered with a
heap of the dead and the dying, who, even as
they fell, clutched to them the plunder of
precious garments and rugs that they had 1
stolen in the chambers below.
But as I paused for a breathing space I
saw that more and more the rabble thronged
upward from the courtyard, and I knew that
no single arm might restrain them. Within
the corridor there stood a great screen of 12
cubits height carved over with the wonders
of the East, and inlaid with much gold and
silver; and springing upon this I tore it
from its place and hurled it as a barrier in
the way. , Then I leaped back towards the
apartments _of , the. princess. , The fretted
door of iVoty yielded to' my shoulder, and,
snatching up the fallen torch, I waved it
into flame, and called upori the royal maiden
by name. , . ,
“Hither,” I cried. “The people. sack the,
palace, and we have no force to withstand
them. Trust thyself to me that I may bear
thee to safety while yet the way to the post-
ern stair is clear.”
At once she came to me, glimmering in
her soft robes, with the jewels about hef
throat flashing in the torch’s light. I
hurled the flaming thing in the faces of the
throng which had even now reached the
barrier of the fallen screen, and drew her
away into the darkness of the western porch.
Strange was the thrill at my heart as I
lifted her in my arms and felt her breath
hot on my cheek, the while with my right
hand I held sword ready to defend her to the
death.
Down the dark stairway we went to the
silent court below, and out into the gloomy
passage which led between the Palace of the
King’s Judgment Seat and the high walls of
the house of Bathsheba which an ancient
king had built in the days when the men of
Judah were strong in battle. Now the great
place was deserted, and the battlements were
in decay, but I knew that the passage was
the way to safety to the gate of Genath.
We spoke no word by the way, but when
we had reached the depth of shadow by
the Atch of Rehoboam I set the maiden
fipoti hef feet, and, leading her by the hand,
drew her towards the stables Where the
king’s charioteers were wont to keep watch
over the royal horses. But the men had left
their charge and had fled into the lower city
to join the revel of madness whose sound
was yet borne to us from afar.
Seeking out my own charger, a horse of
the desert which the king had bought for
me at a great price, I buckled upon him the
Egyptian saddle that hung by his stall, and
throwing a great shawl of Syria on the
pommel, I mounted the maiden before me
and rode outward to the gate. Well knew
I the strength and spirit of that steed, for
I had staked it to bear her whom I loved
beyohfl the blooa-inadness of the men of
Judah and the coming wrath of tile King of
Assyria whose spearmen would gather oil
the morrow before the walls of the city.
Down the steep way to the gate of Genath
the princess lay lightly on my arm. She
asked no word of me whither I went, and
as my youth sang in my veins it seemed that
I had within me the strength of Heracles
to deliver her from all the swordmen of the
world.
But when we came to the gate, a mixed
rabble of many people straggled all across
the way, waving torches and shouting in the
torigUe of that land : “Come hither, O son of
Satgori, lord of Assyria ! Come _ and drink
the ted Wine of .Eliril and the white wine of
tTekoah! Behoid the gates ate open, and
tlezekiah the king is drunken With the
Words of Isaiah! Come, and we will give
thee comely maidens to please thee, and a
princess of the house Of David to wash thy
feet!”
Whereat my anger rose and I cried, “Make
way for the king’s daughter! Back, slaves,
from the path of your mistress!”
And all the rabble gave back, save half a
dozen who ran to lay hold upon my bridle;
but I beat them off with my sword, and the
horse, rearing, spurned them from the patli;
and so I brought off the royal maiden and
bore her safely into the shadowy places of
the valley of Gihon.
And all that night we rode wearily amid
the hill country, going down towards the
sea; for, though I feared not greatly t,he
rabble of Judah, a terror lay upon me lest
we should fall unaware upon a band of the
Assyrian spearmen. But when the dawn
broke we w’ere near to a place called Ekron,
which the war had wasted, and a shepherd
of the land gave us food and milk under a
sycamore tree by the wayside, and mar-
velled greatly that a daughter of the great
king and a captain of his guard in rich
armor should ride abroad so far from the
city.
Then I said to the royal maiden : “Take
rest while I w T atch” ; and I laid the Syrian
shawl for her upon the ground in the
shadow of the tree. And she who was wont
to command, obeyed my word as a little
child, so that I also marvelled at the thing
which the chance of an hour had brought
forth.
Before us spread the great plain which
lies between the hill country and the sea;
and I eased the horse of his saddle, and sat
a little way off thinking in my heart of the
thing that I had done. I knew that the
city of Jerusalem must fall before the might
of the Assyrian ; but I knew also that many
would ask on the morrow for the princess,
and that Sennacherib himself, when he was
within the walls, would search diligently for
her; for the fame of her beauty was as that
of Helen, and all men called her the Rose of
Judah throughout all the countries of the
East. It was in my mind that I should
bear her to Japho, where perhaps I should
find a ship of Egypt or of Phoenicia to carry
me to my own land; but I knew not the
mind of the royal maiden, and I greatly
feared for the chances that lay between us
and the sailing of any vessel when I had
but my single sword for her defence.
As I thus debated in my own mind of the
thing that should be, the sun rose high in
the heavens. The good horse that had borne
us so far cropped the sweet herbage of the
hill side, and it was hard to think that so
much danger lay all about us. Suddenly I
was aware that the princess stood by my
side. .. .
“Aristomenes,” she said, ‘ were it not well
that we went forward on our journey?”
“Whither?” I answered, for obedience to
her will had long been my habit.
“Where live the people of thy race who
speak thy tofigue?”
“Beyond the great sea, that is beyond this
plain that stretches at our feet.”
“Let us go thither,” she said. “I have
heard men say that there are ships at Japho
that fefftne from the uttermost isles, and I
have jewels at my bosom which will buy
those who ma’y serve us.”
Then a! great feat came upon me.
“Shall I who am 1 blit a captain of thy
guard take thee to a strange land to dwell
among a strange people a!fa!f from thy
father’s house?”
But she made answer: “Have I riot seen
what men do in my father’s house? Is there
not blood spilled upon its threshold, and
none save thee to lift a hand against the
spoiler? As the Lord liveth, and as thy
soul liveth, I will not return thither!”
. So We journeyed on. and came to Japho
by the seashore,- and there we lodged with
a man of Cyptfis,- Who knew both the tongue
of the Phqeniciafis and the speech of the
Hebrews; huli there Wsis do ship for many
days. And 1 the princess Werit and came
among the people, and all ffien did her
honor.
At last, when two full weeks Wef£
by, and it seemed to me that all hope or orir
adventure by sea was at an end, a. strange'
came to ris from Jerusalem that the
army of the Assyrian was destroyed, and
that the JfiAg of Judah reigned in peace.
But the tliirig a'pperired l to me as an idle
tale until many crfi/i/' down to us who bore
the same report; and X, thinking much about
the matter, remembered the th& a 1 Isaiah 1 . For
it did indeed seem to me that if the king
had hearkened unto his word even Stfeh a!
thing as this of which men spoke might haver
been brought to pass.
And when I could no longer doubt it, I
went to the Princess Judith and besought
her that she should return to her father’s
house; for to stay longer in Japho seemed
great folly. But when she said me nay,
and was yet determined on our voyage, I
was glad in my heart; for death itself seemed
but a little price to pay for being by her
side.
And that same evening we saw a ship far
off from the land that could not make the
port because there was no wind to fill the
sails. While the sun set, I watched it ; and
I strained my eyes to catch the last glimpse
of it as the light failed, for in that vessel
lay ail my hope,
tVheri it Was flight I slumbered but
lightly, and as ill the dim grey light, of the
dawning I rose that t might see if the ship
had yet come to port. I heard a clanking
of steel in the courtyard and a voice de-
manding entrance in the name of the king.
Well knew I then that the end had come,
and that my single sword was but a reed
before those of the many armed mefl sent
to bring home the king’s daughter.
Yet I went forth to them and cried, “What
seek ye here?”
And the captain of the castle of Jerusalem
who was at the head of the band made an-
swer' readily, “We seek the king’s daughter
whom thori hast stolen from the palace and
holdest here by force.”
Then I cried. “Let him who hath a sword
take her. Let him who is bravest among you
meet me here as man to man, and if my arm
faileth, let him bear away the m-incess by
whose will and at whose command I stand
here.”
As I spoke that word loftily, a man of
Gaza, who was of great stature, and ac-
counted of all men to be the greatest sword-
man in all the land, leaped from his horse
and drew upon me.
But the royal maiden came behind me with
a cry, and said to the man of Gaza, “Wet
not the king’s steel with the blood of a trai-
tor ! Bind ye this. man and hold him fast,
for I have suffered many things at his hands.
Use him not with violence, but see that ye
bind him well; for it is my will that he
stand before my father in Jerusalem to
answer to the king’s daughter for his crimes
against her.”
At these words that I heard from the lips
of her I worshipped all my manhood fell
from me. My sword dropped from my hand
on the stones of the courtyard, and I let
them do with me whatsoever they would.
So the men of the castle guard put chains
upon me, and the princess commanded them
to bind my eyes with a scarf, and they thrust
me into a dark chamber beneath the house.
Long I lay in that darkness, nor knew I
how to think aright of the strange manner of
the things that had befallen; but though
my heart was hot and bitter within me. I
could not curse the princess, because of the
memory of her eyes and the days that we
had been together.
At last I fell asleep and dreamed a dream
of my own land. I saw the temple above the
sea, and the woods where the bees made
honey on Mount Hymettus, and the little
smoke that went up from the altar to the
one white cloud that was in the sky. I saw
the men of my own race, and heard the
clear lonian speech ; and I seemed to be in a
little boat some way off from the land that I
could not reach for all my pulling upon the
oars. And in the midst of my dream and
the longing of it men came to me and dragged
me with no great roughness to another place,
and laying me down on some hard floor left
me.
So I slept again, and when T awakened it
seemed that I was upon a ship, for the place
swayed as to the motion of the waves.
Then one came to me and took the chains
from my hands and the bandage from my
eyes, and said in the speech of my own
people, “Arise and stand before her whom
we serve.”
So I arose, thinking that it was yet but a
part of a dream, and saw that we were in-
deed upon a great ship, and that the prin-
cess stood before me. And while still rapt in
the wonder of it, T looked towards the shore
and saw a troop of horsemen upon the sands
that waved their arms and shouted to us
to return. But the shipmen laughed, and
made answer in the tongue of my own land,
and the princess looked strangely upon me.
“Aristomenes,” she said, “wouldst thou
carry me away by force from my father’s
house and from my own people? Lo. it is I
who have carried thee off; and these men of
thine own nation for a. necklet of the pearls
which Solomon brought from the'South and
a handful of rubies have made the ; e my
prisoner. What wilt thou plead now in thy
defence?”
Then she laughed as the brooks
down the mountains when we marched in
Phocis, and drew a step nearer to me.
“Aristomenes, thou shalt answer to the
king’s daughter for thy crimes.”
And she kissed me full upon the mouth.
