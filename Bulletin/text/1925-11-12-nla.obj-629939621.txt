The Public and the Poet
When Henry Lawson died there was a
mild outcry that his honors in the form of
a public memorial were belated, and that
whatever rewards might be due to poets
should be given in their lifetime. The pre-
sent movement in the direction of showing
public appreciation of Iloderie Quinn, which
has so far been heartily responded to,
avoids that reproach. Nearly 30 years ago
Quinn was the most surprising literary
phenomenon that had appeared in Australia,
and he has continued to write worthily ever
since. For delicacy and simplicity his best
work stands high among the great simple
poems of the English language, and is in
marked contrast to the rough galloping
rhymes which once enjoyed most popular
favor. Quinn in equal degree with Daley,
and to a far greater extent than Kendall,
caught the magic of word and phrase; yet
while keeping the pure English tradition he
is more Australian in outlook and sympathy
than either. It was he who felt “the salt
of inward tears go stinging through the
heart,” who saw the “Camp within the
West” and “Stars in the Sea,” who could
lilt delightfully about “pink feet and white
ankles on beaches of gold” and lead the
viking raid of the inland riders on their
ancestral heritage of the sea. For these and
many other things Australia owes the poet
a deep debt of gratitude; and gratitude
should be the note of the present movement
to do him honor and show him public appre-
ciation. Poetry is not a profitable article
of commerce. In England it survived largely
through the patronage of men of wealth from
age to age; and in Rome the very greatest
period was when the Emperor himself drew 7
the singers around him and gave them the
full recognition they had earned from the
State. But in the best period of Athens they
did better than that; for there the public
itself was the patron, and rose eagerly to
crown those who were most worthy. The
recognition of Roderic Quinn is no act of
charity. By becoming his patron in the old
way and the old spirit, the public honors
itself in honoring a poet. The great days
are not gone wffiile that spirit exists.
Australian Nature Verse
How comes it that our native birds, ani-
mals and forests, so widely different from
those of other lands, have inspired so little
poetry? It is .not that there is any lack of
material for nature poetry here; on the con-
trary, the bush is a land of enchantment, and
our birds unrivalled for beauty and song.
True, we have as yet very little of the
romance and legend that glorify the birds
of older countries, but this is mainly be-
cause the poets have been silent. It is quite
well known to ornithologists that our old
familiar magpie and butcher-bird are even
greater songsters than the nightingale and
skylark, but as yet they have found no poet
to glorify them.
The only collection I have seen of purely
nature verse by Australian poets is Mary
E. Wilkinson’s, in which figure most of our
best writers, from Kendall to O’Dowd. It
is an amazingly poor output! for such a land
of out-of-doors. An anthology of our intro-
spective verse, or of our personal, narrative
or humorous verse, would be far more im-
posing. A study of Miss Wilkinson’s col-
lection reveals that it is full of old-world
echoes, and is often singularly un-Austra-
lian. One finds our autumn described as
“wine-splashed,” and our winter with “locks
of snow.” We hear of “falling leaves” and
"bare boughs”—in the land of the evergreen
gum and wattle. Our poets, with no great
literary heritage to draw upon, depend too
much on the English masters, who wrote
under totally different conditions. None has
written more or more sweetly of the bush
than Henry Kendall, but he has filled Aus-
tralia with wolds and woods, moorlands and
leas, so that his landscapes seem mostly Eng-
lish with Australian names. There are no
wolds or moors or coppices in Australia.
Such a considerable modern singer as John
Bernard O’Hara gives even “Wattle Blos-
soms” this setting:—
All the woods are filled with wattle, and the dells,
Rich with fragrance from the revellers in gold,
Glad with perfume wafted higher than the fells,
Far across the windy spaces of the wold.
Marion Miller Knowles and Molly Mc-
Nutt, Sydney Jephcott and James Thomas
are among the small band who have sung
of the real bush without false notes. But
while our poetry Of action usually rings true
and is racy of the soil, because it was writ-
ten by men who lived the life they wrote of,
too much of our nature verse is merely
secondary, and much of it deals only with
the hardships and alleged monotony of the
bush. A surprising number of our more
considerable poets, including Gordon and J.
Bruntou ►Stephens, were not attracted to
nature subjects at all; and native-born
singers have not yet struck a sufficiently
characteristic note of their own—not even
the later poets, who are much more accom-
plished literary craftsmen than the pioneers.
Nature in Australia is so strikingly indi-
vidual that the poetry it inspires Should
have a note of its own. So far it has not.
The poet’s art may be undoubted, liis classic
allusions apt and stately, his rhyme scheme
elaborate "and wonderful, and .yet his bush
may not be the real bush at all. It might
as well be Attic woods and glades he sings.
Our poets will continue to sdund artificial
and imitative until they forget their models,
sec with their own eyes, and write from
their own hearts. Not till then will we have
a distinctive school of Australian nature
verse, in spite of the immensely rich mat-
erial at hand. Up to the present the great
bulk of bush poetry seems to have been
written from afar by writers who were more
concerned with technique than with their
subject matter, or with what they have seen
and felt themselves.
Of course, there are difficulties, and not
the least is that of nomenclature. A poet
might make something of the bob-o’-link, of
Philomel or the mavis. But what is he to
do with such ugly names as the butcher-bird,
the chestnut-rumped ground-wren, or the
whitc-sliouldered caterpillar-eater, though
these are glorious songsters? Our poets or
our children should be allowed to re-name
the native birds, as young Australians have
already named the tomtit and willy-wagtail,
Jacky Winter and the silver-eye; for the
professional naturalist and the nature-lover
often belong to different species.

Wells Redivivus
It looks as though it would take more
than a war to kill H. G. Wells. Readers
of “The Soul of a Bishop,” “ Joan and Peter,”
“The Secret Places of the Heart” and “The
Dream” were apt to feel that “The Undying
Fire” and “Men Like Gods” were mere
flashes in the pan, and that the Wells of
“Mr. Polly,” “The Food of the Gods” and
even “The Newt Machiavclli” had gone down
a steep place into a fuzzy morass of queru-
lous theorising and religiosity. Christina,
Alberta's Father, just published (Jonathan
Cape), settles that question once and for
all. In it Wells rises again with undimin-
ished vigor: a Wells that triumphantly weds
his characteristic earnestness and literary
charm to an undiminished interest in the
1925 generation of young people.
The war made most of the important writ-
ers in England waver a little. John Gals-
worthy very definitely staggered in the later
Forsyte chronicles —and rose again last year
with “The White Monkey.” Shawls “Heart-
break House” and the playlets that make up
its volume are manifestly inferior to his
earlier work; he came up again with his
stupendous “Back to Methuselah” and the
really marvellous “St. Joan.” Aniold Ben-
nett’s “Mr. Prohack” and “Lilian” seemed
like portents of the w r rath to come ; but he
proved that he still had a kick left by throw-
ing us “Rieeyman Steps.” May Sinclair
seemed to be passing through a distressing
“middle period”; she survived it, and gave
us “The Rector of Wyck” and “A Cure ot
Souls.” Even such a comparatively small
writer as Rose Macaulay woke out of the
sleep that enveloped her previous two or
three novels, and vindicated herself with
“Orphan Island.” To-day the rot seems gen-
erally over, and “the old guard” is showing
that it is by no means dead; it can still
challenge with dignity the generation of
Aldous Huxley.
“Christina Alberta’s Father" has no trace
of weariness or post-war Pedium _ vitae. It
is almost as fresh as “Mr. Polly" or “Ann
Veronica,” both of which it resembles rather
more than anything else that he has written.
Mr. Preemby, who becomes so astonishingly
Sargon, King of Kings, Saviour of a dis-
tressed world, is own brother to Polly, to
Unde Ponderevo, even to Mr. Britling. He
is drawn by a hand that knows the unhappy,
distorted, idealistic, uneducated products of
a civilisation of small shopkeepers. Chris-
tina Alberta herself is the 1925 equivalent of
Ann Veronica of 15 years ago. She-is in-
surgent youth, inquiring, eager, adventurous,
greedy, honest and modern to the last hair
of her bobbed head. We don’t know her in
Australia yet (perhaps we never will —we
pursue quite a different line of march), but
we feel in these pages her reality. Wc have
no difficulty in picturing her in London.
The chief interest of the book lies in these
two characters, though the third, who ex-
plains, when he appears, the circumlocution
of the book’s title, has his counterparts in
the gallery of scientists that has dripped
continuously from Wells’s pen. All the
people, even these three, even Bobby, who
wins what Christina Alberta has of a heart,
are, of course, no more than types. They
rarely are in Wells. They do not give us
much sense of individual character; they are,
as usual, swamped in ideas, in questionings,
in sorting out their relations to the world,
to God, to the whole blessed universe. The
book is only spoiled to the extent that all
Wells is spoiled by this tendency to moralis-
ing and “getting things clear.” We must
appreciate Wells’s excellences in spite of
that characteristic.
And he does command admiration. He is
an old man now, but there is a gusto and
fervor in this book equal to that in any of
his books —and gusto was always at the
bottom of Wells’s charm. He writes of the
younger generation and its foibles and fool-
ishnesses, not with the disgust or disapproval
of a diehard conservative whose joy in life
is past, but with the sympathy and interest
of a man perpetually young and interested
in! the spectacle of humanity’s ceaseless acti-
vity. That interest is all that inspires much
of what Wells writes, and it is certainly the
explanation of the somewhat elusive charm
of this book. The story is of the slightest,
the incidents are, except for the delightfully
improbable stealing of Mr. Preemby, almost
unbelievably “quiet,” there is little that is
new about the characters, there is nothing
new about the style in which the story is
written; yet it is a fairly safe bet that few
people who take it up will have much respite
from that urgent feeling to go on reading.
And that feeling is generated almost en-
tirely, in some subtle way, by the real en-
thusiasm of the writer. He carries us with
him in his enthusiasms; what he feels im-
portant he makes us feel, for the time, im-
portant ; his queer types and the queer things
he says about them leave us no rest until
he has finished with them. It is a high tri-
bute to any writer to be forced to say that
about him. There are few men who can
pull us for a, while entirely into their own
world, a world where their dreams and their
conventions determine the spiritual mode.
When accounts are reckoned up it will
almost certainly be found that the ability
to do this is Wells’s final claim to posterity’s
interest. It is quite certainly his claim to
ours.

Shakspeare Depolarised
Oliver Wendell Holmes many years ago
pointed out the tendency in words and n
ideas they represent to become polarise .
When a thought has lain for a tune in the
mind, it undergoes a change like that i\n m
rest in a certain position gives to iron, tt
becomes magnetic in its relations, and is
traversed by forces which did not originally
belong to it. To get the true value ot yom
fixed idea you must depolarise it by ripping
it out of the old associations and viewing it
in a new dry-light. This conception lies at
the root of a great deal of American so-called
humor and has been played upon by a score
of ingenious writers. It is the underlying
principle in Maurice Baring s Dead Letteis
(Heinemann), imaginary epistles written
into and about such diverse characters as
Helen of Troy, Julius ('aisar and lving
Arthur. Out of their antique and conven-
tional settings the supposed writers are
introduced to us in a costume ot modern
epistolary style, and w 7 e get the full value ot
the depolarising system in an incongruity
that has the result of an artificial though
effective form of humor.
By the pen of this skilled and prolific
author it is made to yield excellent fooling.
Take for example I.ady Macbeth s letter
to Lady Macduff. She asks her "dearest
Flora" to visit her for a few days and to
bring little Jeannie with her, Macbeth being
devoted to children, and after some social
gossip gets to the root of the matter, the
nervous breakdown of her husband.
No sooner had we settled down at Forres than I
soon saw he was far from being himself. His appetite
was bad ; he slept badly and was cross to the servants,
making scenes about nothing’. When 1 tried to ask
him about his health he lost his temper. At last
one day it all came out and I realised that another
tragedy was in store for us. Macbeth is suffering
from hallucinations; this whole terrible business has
unhinged his mind. The doctor always has said he
was highly strung, and tire fact is he has had another
attack, or whatever it is. the same as he had after
the battle, when he thought he had seen three
witches. (1 afterwards found out from Banquo, who
was with him at the time, that the matter was even
worse than I suspected.) He thinks (of course you
will never breathe this to a soul) that lie killed
Duncan! You can imagine what i am going through.
Fortunately, nobody has noticed it.
Only last night another calamity happened. Banquo
had a fall, out riding, and was killed. That night
we had a banquet we could not possibly put off.
On purpose 1 gave strict orders that. Macbeth was
not to be told of the accident until the banquet
was over; but Lennox (who has no more discretion
than a parrot) told him, and in the middle oi dinner
he had another attack, and l had only just time to
get everyone to go away before he began to rave.
As it was, it must have been noticed that he wasn’t
himself.
I am in a terrible position. I never know when
these fits are coming on, and I am afraid of people
talking, because if it once gets about, people are
so spiteful that somebody is sure to start the rumor
that it’s true. Imagine our position, then! So
t beg you. dear Flora, to keep all this to yourself,
and if possible to come here as soon as possible.
P.S. —Don’t forget to bring Jeannie. It will
do Macbeth good to see a child in the house.
From the woes of Lady Macbeth we turn
to the worries of Goneril, daughter of King
Lear, writing to her sister Began : —
We have been having the most trying time lately
with Papa, and it ended to-day in one of those
scenes which are so painful to people, like you and
me, who hate scenes. This is what has happened.
When Papa came here he brought 100 knights with
him, which is a great deal more than we could put
up, and some of them had to live in the village. The
first thing that happened was that they quarrelled
with our people and refused to take orders from them.
.... For instance, only the day before I found that
blue vase which you brought back from Dover for
me on my last birthday broken to bits. Of course
l made a fuss, and Oswald declared that one of
Papa’s knights had knocked it over in a drunken
brawl. I complained to Papa, who flew into a
passion.... He even said I was lacking in filial
duty. I was determined to keep my temper, so i
said nothing.
Ever since his last illness he has lost not only his
memory but his control over language, so that often
when he wants to say one thing he says just the
opposite, and sometimes when he wishes to say
some quite simple thing he uses bad language quite
unconsciously. Of course we are used to this, and
we. don’t mind, but I must say it is very awkward
when strangers are here. For instance, the other day
before quite a lot of people, quite unconsciously
he called me a dreadful name. Everybody was un-
comfortable and tried not to laugh, but some people
could not contain themselves.
But perhaps the most annoying thing is
Papa’s fool. You know, darling, that I have always
hated that kind of humor. He comes in just as one
is sitting down to dinner, and heats one on the
head with a hard, empty bladder, and sings utterly
idiotic songs, which make me feel inclined to cry.
The other day, when we had a lot of people here,
just as we were sitting- down in the banqueting-hall
Papa’s fool pulled my chair from behind me so that
I fell sharply down on the floor. Papa shook with
laughter, and said "Well done, little fool,’’ anci all
the courtiers who were there, out of pure snobbishness
of course, laughed too.... Of course Albany refused
to interfere. Like all men and all husbands, he is
an arrant coward....
At the same time, I own that, although I kept my
temper for a long time, when it finally gave way
I was perhaps a little sharp. I am not a saint, nor
an angel, nor a lamb, but I do hate unfairness and
injustice. It makes my blood boil. But I hope that
you, with your angelic nature and your tact and
your gentleness, will put everything right and make
poor Papa listen to reason.
Rosaline’s letter to her friend Olivia touch-
ing the scandal associated with the name of
Romeo in the affaire Juliet is delightful:—
I made Romeo’s acquaintance two years ago. We
at once got on well together, and 1 never minded
his childishness, which used to get on some people’s
nerves. He was the kind of person whom it was
really impossible to dislike, because he was so
impetuous, so full of high spirits and good humor.
Some people thought he was good looking; I never
did.... We were practically engaged, although noth-
ing was announced.... If Romeo did marry Juliet he
did it because he could not help himself, after
having been discovered in her garden by that old
cat Lady Capulet, who is a very, very wicked woman
and capable of anything. .. . When you next come to
see me I will show you Romeo’s letters. Fortunately
I have kept them all. They are very beautiful, and
some of them are in rhyme; and you will see for
yourself whether he loved me or not. I cannot read
them without crying.
Apparently none of Hamlet’s companions
were capable of writing a letter, though
Ophelia might well have left a diary disclos-
ing her inmost communings, so the office of
scribe is left to a Frenchman, who describes
his visit to Oovent Garden to see the play :
Not having the good fortune to understand the
English language, I could not follow one word of
the dialogue. But I am told that the play gains
rather than loses by being translated, though our
Anglomaniacs say it is untranslatable. . . . The play
is sheer madness —nay, more, it is the wildest and
most extravagant thing that a madman could devise
in a fit of delirium. Towards the end of the play
only six, characters remain alive, and they al-1 die a
violent death. Lest the spectators should be over-
come bv so many murders, the divine Shakspeare
has given them moments of relief in the person of
the Lord Chamberlain, who is a coarse buffoon, ana
the conversation of the gravediggers, who, while they
crack their insipid jests, dig a real grave.
Mr. Baring informs his readers that th«e
letters "are in no wise meant to be either
historical documents or historical studies or
aids to the understanding of history, or
learning of any kind with or without tears.
The note was apparently prompted by the
inquiry of a correspondent when the letters
appeared, as originally they did, in the news-
paper press, "for further details with regard
to Lady Macbeth’s housekeeping.”
This bundle from the Dead Letter Office
of the World constitutes a fine piece of imagi-
native work full of the laughter that ex-
presses itself in chuckles. It is humanity
with its stage clothes off.
T. B. C.
Love and the Great
If it were possible to obtain statistics in
regard to such unmathematical things as
love stories, it would probably be found
that the story of Dante and Beatrice has
the widest reputation. Beatrice may have
been mortal as the wife of a I lorentine
banker. She is immortal as the white star
that ' shone in Dante’s firmament and led
him at last through Paradise. In this
world she lives for ever in the Vita Nuova
and the Divine Comedy. So greatly did
Dante transfigure the woman who, we sup-
pose, moved in the society of medifeval
Florence that he, an apostle of the Catholic
Church, dared put into her eyes the light
of the nature, human and divine, of the
Christ. “Through a perfect gentleness” he
translated her from a material world to a
state of beatitude, and though he was wad-
ded to a mortal Gemma, Beatrice in the
High Heavens was the immortal bride ot
his soul. , .
We are in the habit of isolating the ro-
mance of Dante and Beatrice from other
love stories; but, lacking the test of earthly
trials, it is allied with more than one story
whose setting, so far as we are concerned,
is on the stage of this world where human
frailty and human strength make up a more
or less divine comedy. Dante s story soars
on spiritual wings far above the sphere of
human loves and hates, but surely the idyll
of the Brownings, with its exquisite spirit
enshrined in “By the Fireside” and "Son-
nets from the Portuguese,” is linked with
the triumphant close of the Divine Comedy.
Inevitably our thoughts turn to that other
Dante and his Beatrix. When Walter Dev-
erell discovered Elizabeth Siddal in a London
milliner’s shop, he discovered not only a
model for the pre-Raphadito brothers, but
an inspiration for Rossetti, who gave her
immortality in two branches of art. Writ-
ing to him about Miss Siddal, Ruskin said:
“I think she would be very happy to see how
much more beautifully, perfectly and ten-
derly you draw when you are drawing her
than when you draw anybody else. She
cures you of all your w r orst faults when you
look at her.” Like the love of Dante Ali-
ghieri, Rossetti's was fundamentally spiri-
tual. To his Beatrice he wrote:
Lady, I fain would tell how evermore
Thy soul I know not from thy body, nor
Thee from myself, neither our love from God.
These lines breathe the spirit of the Paradiso.
Elizabeth Rossetti’s early death from con-
sumption links her love story tvith that ol
Keats, who never had an opportunity to put
romance to the crucial test of marriage.
Fanny Brawn kept Keats awake through the
night'“as a tune of Mozart’s might do.” The
lines
Ah! dearest love, sweet home of all my fears,
And hopes, and joys, and panting miseries
are dedicated to her. But he also wrote:
“I have two luxuries to brood over in my
walks, your loveliness and the hour of my
death. Oh that I could have possession of
them both at the same minute!” He con-
fessed to his brother George : "I hope 1 shall
never marry... . The roaring* of the wind
is my wife, and the stars through, the
window-panes are my children; the mighty
abstract idea of Beauty in all things stifles
the more divided and minute domestic hap-
piness.” Keats’s vision, like Dante's, was
vast; but, unlike the Brownings or Rossetti,
he was afraid that the hills and valleys of
domesticity might shut it out.
Time, nationality and circumstance are
powerless to do away with a parallel between
the love stories of Sir Philip Sidney and
Ferdinand Lasallc. The moral of botli
stories is to be found in Browning's "Statue
and the Bust”:
Not at first sight, nor with a dribbgd shot
Love gave the wound
to Astrophel and Stella. Wordsworth’s in-
terpretation of the stock-dove’s song de-
scribes the slow beginning of the love of Sir
Philip Sidney for Lady Penelope Devereux.
But there is more of the spirit of “that crea-
ture of the fiery heart,” the. nightingale, in
Lasalle’s passionate declaration on his first
meeting with Helene von Donniges. It is in
the consummation of love that the stories
are alike —or, rather, in the failure to con-
summate. Not until she is the unhappy wife
of Lord Rich does Stella discover her real
love for Astrophel. Not until she has raised
in the socialist “messiah of the nineteenth
century” a determination to win rather than
steal her from the stronghold of con-
servatism to which by birth she belongs
does Helene yield to Lasalle’s importuni-
ties to give him leave to commit the
theft. Lady Rich’s ultimate abjuring of her
marriage vows for the, sake of a man un-
worthy to sit at the feet of the gentle and
valorous Sidney, and Lasalle’s searing of his
conscience by fighting the fatal duel with
Helene’s paternally approved lover after she
had declared herself a dutiful daughter, are
sardonic endings to the stories of four “tragic
comedians.”
Breadth of vision is indispensable to the
consummation of love in the world of the
great, as it is in less degree in the world
of lesser people. Yet, paradoxically, breadth
of vision may prevent consummation. The
world loves to linger sentimentally over the
memory of “Sweet Ann Rutledge,” but it
is doubtful if America’s greatest statesman
ever loved as the poor, vacillating tragic
comedians loved. His proposals to Mary
Owens were purely quixotic. In his life with
Mary Todd he failed to realise those “dreams
of Elysium” about which he wrote so wist-
fully to a friend. His vision was akin to
the vision splendid that Dante bequeathed
to the world in the Divine Comedy. Fail-
ure to attain, as Dante undoubtedly attained
when he wrote the beatific ending which
gave to what some people regard as a tragedy
the obverse title, stamped on Abraham Liu-
coln’s face the sadness that is palpable even
on canvas or paper.
It was breadth of vision that made Mary
Godwin able to condone such passing pas-
sions as Shelley’s for the Countess Emilia
Viviani. “Epipsyehidion” was her reward.
Breadth of vision made George Sand willing,
to sacrifice a measure of her genius to the
genius of Chopin, and his nocturnes and
etudes recompensed her. Genius and the
appreciation of genius were denied Heine’s
Mathilde, but her patient loyalty through
the long calvary of his dying links her up
with the immortal Something that gives en-
during light to stories which the decorous
have ever and again tried to smother with the
dark cloak of convention.
IEENE WILKINSON.
A Satchel of Books
The Crooked Stick, by Rolf Boldrewood (States
Publishing Co.). Drought, flood, the bushranger and
the cattle duffer, the new chum and the currency
lass —all the elements of days now passed into history
go to make up a somewhat wordy romance of the
old school, but virile, clean and healthy. It was
worth resurrecting.
A Mummer’s Tale, by Anatole Prance (John Lane).
The public owes an increasing debt to this publishing
house for presenting' the work's of the late novelist
in good translations from the French text. The
present is a popular edition of the very characteristic,
though comparatively short, work which embodies
in Dr. Trublet one of Anatole Prance’s most notable
creations.
Art and Publicity, the special autumn number of
the Studio, is a symposium of the art of advertising.
Futurism is here thoroughly at home. Austria leads
the world in strange, startling and often beautiful
designs calculated to rivet the wandering eye of
the prospective purchaser, and Germany comes a
good second. Britain and America are retiring by
comparison, but each country has its individuality.
Ladies Pair and Frail, by Horace Bleackley (John
Lane). These sketches of the demi-monde during
the eighteenth century present many characters whose
lives of notoriety and license were interwoven with
the political and'social fabric of a period representing
the pendulum’s full swing from the days of Puritan-
ism The sketches are pencilled in with deft fingers
and colored with the broad primaries of the time.
Of the ladies some attained position and piety ; the
majority only paupers’ coffins.
The Secret of Chiitineys, by Agatha Christie
(John Lane). Chimneys is one of those stately
homes of England which arc passing into the
hands of American millionaires. A packet of com-
promising love letters, the mysterious disappearance
of the MS. of some scandalous memoirs, a network
of intrigue in an obscure Slovakian principality,
an oil concession and a search for gold make up
a narrative full of excitement and action. the
novel confirms Mrs. Christie’s title to a front
place among writers of sensational fiction.
The Pit) Surprise (Middleton Publications, Ltd.,
London). This kids’ book can confidently be tipped
as a winner in the Christmas handicap. Besides
being printed in fine large type and gorgeously
illustrated, it emits loud squawks when handled.
The small bov or girl who hears a book that squawks
and doesn’t want to know the reason why is an
unusual infant.
Cat’s Cradle, by Maurice Baring (Heinemann).
A long storv which cannot be scamped without
loss to the ‘reader. The plot is cast in London
and Rome, and it is from the interaction of lives
upon each other that the novel gets its title.
“Lives are like the pattern of a game of cat’s
cradle the same threads get changed into
different patterns and combinations.” It is illus-
trated —an unusual feature in the modern novel —
but for quality the work of the pencil is not
comparable to that of the pen.
More Humors of History, by Arthur Moreland (T.
Werner Laurie). An appeal to the child’s mind
through the picturesque, romantic, dramatic and even
humorous elements in history is rarely made, even
in these days of new educational methods. What
A’Beckett tried to do for an older generation in his
“Comic History of England,” Mr. Moreland, using
the pencil more extensively than the pen, endeavors
to do for the children of to-day, and his effort is
distinctly successful. The present number carries
British history only to the end of the twelfth
century ; but there will be a demand for more.
Behold the Hebrides! by A. A. MacGregor (W.
and It. Chambers). Written by a descendant of
lan MacGregor of Glengyle, that sturdy Scot who,
rather than abandon his royal name after the long
and bitter persecutions of Clan Alpin, fled to the
island of Lewis. A wild and rugged land that is m
many places little changed since Samuel Johnson
made the great excursion of his life; but full of
romance linked to the names of Prince Charlie,
Flora Macdonald, the Macleods and other chiefs who
lived in a bygone glory. The book is illustrated by
a number of photographs, which add to the interest of
a well-written and picturesque text.
Architecture, the journal of the X.S.W. Institute
of Architects, has something pertinent to sav on
builders’ scaffoldings, which, owing to Sydney's con-
dition of continual upheaval, are an important fea-
ture of the million city’s landscape. In Europe and
I'.S.A. these structures are called “Builders’ Ar-
cades,” are chaste and elegant in design, and often
have depicted on them perspectives of the buildings
planned and other publicity devices. .The decorative
motives and placing of the panels show caieiul
study. The unsightly, poster-covered erections, from
which the laughter-loving workman pours liquid
cement on the passer-by in Sydney, call for some
improvement.
Twenty Years of My Life, by Louise Jopling
(John Lane). Whether all Mrs. Jopling-Rowe has
chronicled was really worth recording the reader
must decide for himself. The book covers a wide
expanse of social and artistic life in the Victorian
age and gossipy sketches and anecdotes of authors,
actors, artists and notable men and women in the
latter ’part of last century fill its pages. As a
portrait painter the author was brought in touch
with the art world of her day. and some of the
most interesting passages in her brightly written
biographv deal with that side of her diverse experi-
ences. One of her studies was presented to the
Sydney Art Gallery by its purchaser.
The Morality of Birth Control, by Ettie A. Rout
(John Lane). Besides advancing the usual argu-
ments in favor of the scientific limitation of human
fecundity, the writer puts up a plea, not for the un-
married mother —she is somewhat out of date - but
for the unmarried lover. Owing to the expense of
keeping a young wife in chops and idleness, the
habit has grown up of postponing marriage; and
undoubtedly the unofficial union has a growing popu-
larity. Among some classes such trial-marriages
have always been common; the system at least has
the benefit of proving suitability and establishing
fertility. “The vogue and rationale of such an
institution should be the subject of careful social
study-—not the object of conventional abuse and
panic.” So speaks the iconoclastic lady who fought,
largely in the columns of The Bulletin, a lone
fight for hygienic equipment for Australian soldiers
during the war. In Australia, however, where the
birth statistics indicate that the trial marriage is
not an unknown institution, a possibly better method
is available. The union may be solemnised in
church or registry office, and if it prove unsatisfac-
tory', the parties have merely to separate for a
period, one of them has to get and the other ignore
an order for restitution of conjugal rights, and a
divorce is granted. This is a form of tiial-marriage
which leaves the dragon of convention sleeping.

Why they are the best
for our roads
Because they are lightning-like in their rapidity of action.
Because they are so made that there is nothing to prevent
that lightning-like action at any time and all times.
Because, as a natural consequence, they are capable of
absorbing—and do absorb—each and every shock, no
matter how fast the shocks may come.
Because they can be adjusted to suit the tension of the
springs on the particular car to which they are fitted.
Because the car owner himself can make such adjust-
ment. The little red wrench provided is the only tool
needed for the job.
Because they do their work without straining and without
any irritating noises.

Then you would appreciate the im-
portance of precision at every point in
its manufacture.
In building the first practical add-
ing machine, William Seward Bur-
roughs made his drawings on metal
plates which could not shrink a frac-
tion of a hair. He drew lines and struck
centres under a microscope.
To-day, in the factory of the Bur-
roughs Adding Machine Company, you
will find the same high standards of
workmanship. A corps of inspectors,
specially trained, check the accuracy of
Burroughs manufacture. Dies and
gauges are tested daily. The shop test
fixtures are tested once a day (in some cases once every hour) by
masters in the Standards Department. One quarter of a thousandth
part of an inch is sufficient to cause the rejection of a part. The
slightest departure from perfection disqualifies any part.
When the parts are assembled into sections, each section of the
machine is thoroughly examined. Then the sections are assembled
and the completed machine passes through three tests for adjustment.
Finally it must survive Commercial Inspection. Here it must perform
repeatedly every operation that the operator can demand of it in
actual use.
These are reasons why more than 900,000 Burroughs Adding,
Bookkeeping, Calculating and Duplex machines have been sold
throughout the world.
A Burroughs representative will be pleased to discuss better ways
to do the figure work of your business. Just telephone our nearest office

Grammarye.
Where a grove of drooping myrtles
Grows beside a timbered hill,
In a place but little knoAvn,
As I wandered there alone
Yesterday, I met a fairy,
Laugh who may and scoff who will!
Oh, the wonder of that meeting
Will be mine to treasure long,
With the glory of the bush
Bound about me, live and lush,
And a thrush above me yielding
All his little heart in song.
Never spider wove such silken
Web as that which draped her limbs,
And the dream-depths in her eyes
Made me think of twilight skies
When the last gleam on still waters
Greys away and softly dims.
Oh, she had a power of magic
And a voice that deftly wove
Strange enchantment; for I heard
In its music breeze and bird,
And the sound of wavelets rippling
tip and down a secret cove!
Though the thrush above me listened
Leaning silent in his tree,
Knowing, doubtless, AA’hat she sang,
As her sweet notes rose and rang,
Yet her song, alas, was alien,
Worlds and worlds away from me!
Still, the while she sang, I visioned,
Standing ’neath those myrtle trees
Half in dream and half aivake,
Lonesome isle and lonely lake,
Ruins old of fort and castle
Looking down on ancient seas,
Glimpses came of misty mountains,
And of deep glens under snow,
Where blue chimney smoke arose
At a quiet evening’s close.
And of hearth-fires redly burning.
With folk musing, in their glow.
Thus she came to me, that tairy—■
Laugh who may and scoff who will —
As I Avandered all aJone
In a place but little known;
And the spell she cast upon me
Makes a wonder in me still.

Signs.
Day after drab day, rain, continuous rain !
On sodden roads and roofs and streaming
hills
I thought the suyt would never come again.
I heard, despondently, the thin-voiced rills,
The run of water to the brimming well.
The monk of crazy spouts, the drum-like
beat
Of drops that on the old tub-bottom fell
Most drearily. There were no eyes to meet
That were not weary, dull and very old.
I had no love; I felt I could not face
The uncongenial task, nor ever mould
Myself to hear or heed in such a place
The irking duty-prate of decency.
Then through a cloud-rift leapt in ecstasy
The young-limbed sun and SAviftly loosed a
shaft.
I saAv in flight across a hill that laught
The last pale fringe of rain.
A thrush poured out the pain
Of pent-up love, all in a liquid note
That rippled in his throat.
Two kookaburras chuckled sheer delight;
And when I looked up, drinking in the
signs.
Madonna Spring, walking in blue and white,
Had lit her golden candles on the pines.

Where hyacinths and jonquils grow;
A pathway AA r here the caravan
Has herald in the camel’s bell,
And merchant trains pass to and fro
Along the roads of Ispahan.
The big, blue Cashmere butterflies
That flit beside the white peacocks
Amongst musk-melons scattered far —
A shepherd watches with rapt eyes
The sky, like those who left their flocks
To follow Bethlehem's lone star.
There, with the honeycomb and date
For food, for earthly lot respose,
To lie among my tulips, sage,
Is all the boon I ask of Fate,
To watch the bloAving of the rose.

I am one with the sun and the rain,
With the tireless things that run,

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1925.
NOVEMBER 14.
Federal politicians avlio served in the late
Parliament and aspire to serve in the next
have had to reckon with the fact that the
personnel of their constituencies has altered
greatly, although the boundaries are un-
changed. The defunct Parliament en-
acted a compulsory-voting law which will
spur to the polling-booths hundreds of thou-
sands of people who were never there before.
At the last election 64.67 p.c. of the men
and 51.19 p.c. of the women voted; this time,
as Queensland experience suggests, there is
more likely to be an 80 p.c. vote of both
sexes than one of 57.95 p.c. Mith such
a horde of new electors there may be some
freakish results. Nevertheless the indi-
cations are that the new electors avill
vote according to the views they have formed
of the transport strikes which have ravaged
the country for 14 months, and made all
thinking people ask themselves whether Aus-
tralia is to be ruled in the interests of the
Avliole people or those of a mischievous and
intolerant section —whether majority rulto
or mob rule is to prevail. Certainly if the
new electors judge the parties and candidates
by their attitude to the transport strikes
and the political questions arising therefrom
they won’t go far wrong.
* * * *
Tried by the transport-strike test, the
Bruce-Page Government comes through
pretty well. It is innocent of causing the
strikes or assisting the strikers in any Avay ;
and in dealing Avitli the situation it has been
heavily handicapped by having no Federal
police, police-courts or prisons. When it
urged State Labor Governments to give
police protection to men wdio xvere willing
to carry on (and it is now evident
that had police protection been given
straightAvay the strike of British sea-
men Avould have soon collapsed) it got
nothing but insults for its pains. It was
tardy in tackling the imported work-stoppers
chiefly responsible for the turmoil, and the
Deportation Board it. appointed proved to be
procrastination personified; still, one of the
alien plotters against Australian industries
and institutions has discovered, apparently
as a result of the long-drawn-out proceed-
ings, that he is needed forthwith in Britain
to start another union, and his satellite is
expected to receive an urgent summons to
Amsterdam or Helsingfors or Moscow. The
Government proposes to check the activities
of strife-promoters by providing for compul-
sory secret ballots on strike questions, the
idea being to prevent the industrious majo-
rity of a union being coerced by a violent
minority, as happened on the Cairns (N.Q.)
waterfront, or called out by a Red branch
secretary to expedite the Revolution. It
is a good idea, and if unionists’ wives are
authorised to take part in the ballots, and if
it is made an offence punishable with six
months’ imprisonment to call a law-abiding
citizen a “scab,” the plan will be improved.
The Government has also a creditable record
of work accomplished for the nation. It
has substantially reduced the income-tax,
raised the old-age and invalid pension and
made a start with the job of paying off the
war debt. It has revised its own tariff on
Protectionist lines and negotiated important
concessions in the British tariff. It lias a
defence policy providing for (1) a service-
able R.A.N. co-operating with the British
Navy, (2) an army consisting of five infan-
try and two cavalry divisions, and (3) an
efficient air force; and its programme for the
next Parliament includes national insurance
against unemployment, sickness and old age.
The hardworking Prime Minister and his
Treasurer have been muddily attacked, but
in character they are at least equal, and in
ability superior, to any pair on the other
side.
* * * *
The events of the past fortnight have
made it clearer than ever that the commu-
nist bullies directing the transport strikes
have been relying on bluff and the moral
cowardice of State Labor Governments and
the Federal Labor party. And very faint-
hearted bullies some of them proved when
their bluff was called by Queensland farm-
ers at Cairns and Bowen and by Westralian
policemen at Fremantle. A few resolute
words from the Federal Labor party would
have stopped the mad job-control campaign
against the Commonwealth Government
Shipping Line and the Australian mercantile
marine, which, though paying the best wages
in the world, has become the jest of the
Seven Seas; would have curtailed, if not
prevented, the hopeless strike of British sea-
men ; would have averted the serious losses
suffered by the Qucnsland sugar districts and
the criminal sacrifice of Westralia’s timber
trade with South Africa. But the words
were never uttered. We have had instead
thick-headed support for the strikers; hys-
terical opposition to the proceedings against
alien destroyers; boisterous approval of
State Labor Governments in their impu-
dent defiance of the national, authority.
There lias also been gloomy repetition of
savage Red threats that, if the Government
wasn’t properly humble to the said destroy-
ers, the communists would, among other
things, call out the gasworkers and electric-
light staffs in the Big Cities and invite the
criminal classes to do their worst. And
while championing the communist plotters
and acquiescing in an instalment of
the “dictatorship of the proletariat,” the
Federal Labor Party has had the face
to assert that it has no connection with
Russian communism in any shape or form.
As a matter of fact, the very first plank in
its platform—“socialisation of industry, pro-
duction, distribution and exchange”-—is Rus-
sian communism. The “Supreme Economic
Council,” which is to supersede Par-
liament as regards the control of
nationalised industries, is Russian com-
munism. From Russia also were borroAved
those insane proposals for the election of
officers, the abolition of “useless discipline,”
and the arming of individuals who have com-
pleted their service in the volunteer batta-
lions which are to supersede the qompulsorily
trained army established by a Labor Govern-
ment, and which are not to combine with
Canadian, Maoriland or S’African sol-
diers for the defence of any portion
of the Empire, even as Mr. Charl-
ton’s cheap submarines are not to
co-operate with the British Navy. And
the self-determination principle (“Labor
will prize self-determination, not merely for
itself, but as the heritage of all men in all
lands”) is as Russian as repudiation and
the Cheka. In one part of its programme
the Charlton crowd proposes to abolish the
Senate, and thus deprive Westralia and Tas-
mania of six of their eleven representatives
in the National Parliament; in another part
it allows that every dissatisfied portion of
the Commonwealth and the Empire has the
right to secede,. These stupid inconsistencies
are the result of slovenly thinking. The
party has plenty of fluent muckrakers, but jt
is short of men with clear heads and a flair
for government of the constructive order. Its
financial policy is an oscillation between
incessant London loans and issues of
paper money. Having let the farmers down
by siding with the lawless mobs ivlio have
been holding up their produce, it proposes to
commandeer their wheat by establishing com-
pulsory Government-controlled pools, which
will doubtless enable Labor supporters, such
as boarding-housekeepers, to collect fat com-
missions on unprofitable Government deals in
covnsacks and the like. If a party with
such a record and such a programme is
returned to power on Saturday, Australia
will need all the help it may get from Provi-
dence, for it will get none from a Labor
Government.

THE INSURRECTION.
The story of the Australian Insurrection
will be Avritten some day unless the forces
of disorder are allowed to win complete con-
trol of the country, in which case they will
make the printing press a Government mon-
opoly, and nothing will be put in type except
by the Government, or by agents of whom
it approves. In that case the story will
have to be left alone, or published elsewhere.
When the details so far are put in order they
present a striking spectacle—it might be
called an incredible spectacle. Something
similar may have been staged under the name
of comic opera, but even that is doubtful.
The insurrection is headed, by a small group
of imported persons who act as generals.
They say that their corps of officers, the en-
rolled members of the Communist body,
largely imported also, numbers only a thou-
sand or lavo, but that, by virtue of capable
organisation, these control the great mass
of trades unionists, and through them a great
part of the Government machinery. The con-
trol is obvious enough. They hope to cap-
ture the whole apparatus, and then make
their possession permanent. In addition to
their local forces the leaders have directed
for some time an imported army of 5000 men
or so. This body of disturbers is concen-
trated in a few seaports, and is nearly equal
in numbers to the widely-scattered police
establishments of all the State Governments.
Such a situation Avould be serious even if the
State police were reliably enlisted against
the insurrection. Unfortunately more than
half take their orders from State Govern-
ments which take theirs in turn from the
same source as the insurrection does. The
imported force directed by the insurrection-
ists is in itself 34 times as numerous as the
Australian soldiery regularly under arms,
and this sketchy army of ours is scattered
everywhere. The imported force was re-
cruited and brought here free of charge to
the Boss rebels, being simply embezzled off
British vessels on arrival. Some of the re-
cruits who tried to desert back to their ships
found, after an argument with the pickets,
that they had entered on compulsory service
without knowing it. Further, this imported
force is maintained under compulsion by
Australians, many of whom object bitterly.,
but are quite helpless. Except in rare cases
the means of livelihood are only procurable
in this country by joining and remaining in
one of the unions Avhich the Communist-
insurgents claim to control, and apparently
do control. Continuance inside is condi-
tional on the payment, in addition to the
ordinary dues for the support of the insti-
tution, of “levies” for all sorts of purposes.
Even the law courts can be invoked to en-
force payment of “levies,” though the spec-
tacle of alleged agencies of law and order
acting as debt-collectors for the movement
which aims at lawlessness and disorder ought
to raise a laugh. The position of the union
slave is thus rather like that of a fly in
a web. If one fly even consults another
about finding a way out he is liable to have
his compulsory subscription refused, and
then to be declared a dead fly for being “non-
financial.”
* * *
That is the first chapter, and the story
doesn’t improve as it goes on. Nothing is
heard of any movement worth calling such
on the part of the Supreme Government,
even after a year of disorder, to strengthen
its pitiable forces. If it is suspected of any-
thing of the sort it is taunted by its riotous
opponents with “giving way to panic.” In
its own proud fashion it values the opinion
of its own and its country’s enemies too
highly to “give way to panic” when they
say it shouldn’t. Even in its temporary capi-
tal, Melbourne, the Government appears to
have little authority or influence. It de-
pends wholly on the State authority, which,
though certainly anti-Communist, is a two-
headed Administration, led by a pair of
elderly and undecided gentlemen. Moreover,
the State police force there is, in proportion to
population, the weakest among seven ; it is
ill-paid ; and it isn’t a helpful circumstance
that over one-third of it ivas dismissed in
1923 for starting an upheaval of its own,
and Avas replaced by new 7 men. Thus the
curious circumstance has arisen that an im-
ported rebel has served public notice on the
Australian Prime Minister in the latter’s
ow 7 n fortress that his life w 7 ill be in danger
if two other imported rebels are interfered
with. Also, he has notified that the rebel
force, partly imported and partly composed
of local criminality, w 7 ill loot and destroy
the best residential quarter of Melbourne.
At time of writing the law was being
searched to see if anything could be done to
quiet the imported individual, and save the
residential quarter. If there is any doubt
on the subject, which appears incredible, the
fact that a Ministry with so many lawyers
in it should have dissolved Parliament with-
out putting this position right is matter for
sardonic merriment.
*. * * #
The situation is one for which there is
no discoverable parallel. It has elements
of the grotesque which put it in a category
by itself. Some features are not unusual,
but these don’t include the army of irre-
gulars which has been stolen off ships,
or the Avorkers’ compulsory contribu-
tions to that army’s maintenance, or
the industrial excommunication of non-
subscribers. A Government of procras-
tinators has let Australia into a posi-
tion in which it is an object of laughter for
men and the minor gods. Yet that Govern-
ment must be supported to the utmost in
order to avoid something infinitely worse.
Certainly there is always a hope that it may
improve. History records that Rehoboam,
after making one bad break, due to inex-
perience, at the age of 41 —which is also the
age of Prime Minister Bruce —became a
vigorous and capable ruler, and held his port-
folio continuously for 17 years.

THE LABOR DEFENCE POLICY.
“Labor stands for national defence,” said
Matthew Charlton in his policy speech ;
“it was Labor that gave Australia the only
defence it has ever possessed.” The latter
assertion is not strictly true, nor is it just
to the memory of Alfred Deakin or that
of the army in which Monasii, Ciiauvel,
White, Hobbs, Cox, Ryrie, Glasgow and
Elliott were trained. But it is true to the
extent that a Labor Government remodelled
that army on the basis of compulsory train-
ing, preliminary legislation having been
passed by other Governments, and completed
the arrangement for an Australian fleet unit
working in with the Royal Navy and con-
sisting of one battle-cruiser, three light
cruisers, six destroyers and three submarines,
with the necessary auxiliaries. And when
it is recalled that the compulsory-training
system contributed usefully to Australia’s
war effort; that one of the light cruisers,
while helping the others to convoy A.I.F.
troopships in safety, sank the enemy’s most
successful commerce raider; and that the
battle-cruiser scared Von S fee's squadron
to its doom in the South Atlantic, it would
be churlish to refuse the Labor Government
of 1910-13 a share of tlte credit. But the
Labor men who inaugurated the compulsory-
training system and established the R.A.N.
are either dead or have left the party, or been
flung out of it as traitors to Labor’s ideals.
Their places have been taken by roaring
Reds, vote-liunters with plans for giving de-
fence a subordinate place in the scheme of
unemployed relief, and pacifists who believe
that the White Australia doctrine can be
made effective for all time by hands-across-
tbe-seas arrangements with the excluded
colored races. So the kind of defence for
which Labor now stands is not the kind for
which it stood in the days of Fisher,
Hughes, Pearce, McGregor, Hutchison,
Guthrie, Spence, Thomas and Batchelor,
* * * *
Of 41 elected Labor members in the last
Parliament, only four saw war service, and
in two cases the period was brief. That
would not matter if the party as a whole
accepted the principle that Australia, having
erected legislative barriers against
1,000,000,000 Asiatics, must be powerfully
defended, and if in framing a policy con-
sonant with that principle it deferred to the
superior knowledge of men eminent in the
science of war. But the “advanced” section
of the party (Walsh is one of its leaders)
rejects the White Australia doctrine; the
pacifist section is against all defence mea-
sures ; and the pro-defence section includes
unemployed-relief men, anti-cruiser men,
others who would vote for cruisers if they
dared (Gabb, for instance), and advocates
of army reform on Russian lines; and in the
multitude of counsellors there is confusion.
As regards naval defence in particular, the
Labor “policy” varies with the individual
and changes with the seasons. The replacing
of the obsolete Sydney and Melbourne by
two 10,000-ton cruisers was opposed by the
Labor party in both Houses because “efforts
are being made by the U.S. President and
the British Prime Minister to convene an-
other conference to deal with the question of
further disarmament, and in view of the
early sitting of the League of Nations,” for
which reasons “expenditure on naval con-
struction should be deferred.” When this
Anstey amendment was lost, W. G.
Mahony moved that “any sum spent in
naval construction should be expended in
Australia, thus relieving the distress caused
by unemployment,” time being no object in
naval construction on the Maiiony plan,
though it is the essence of the contract
everywhere else. The Maiiony proposition
having been defeated also, the Government
was attacked up hill and down dale for not
having the cruisers built in Australia. It
was blackguarded so persistently, and belief
in the capacity of Australian dockyard work-
ers to construct cruisers was so passionately
expressed, that all Cockatoo Island ex-
pected a promise of at least one cruiser
contract in Mr. Charlton’s policy speech.
Mr. Charlton, however, has no use for
cruisers, whether built locally or abroad.
He is all for submarines, aeroplanes and
‘“shore guns, within range of which no enemy
vessel will appear”—excluding Papua and
the Mandated Territory there are 11,310
miles of shore. And his submarines and
shore guns, at least, will have to be im-
ported.
* * * » •
“It has been shown,” says the worthy
Charlton in a transport of enthusiasm for
cheapness, “that Australia could get 16 sub-
marines for tile cost of one cruiser.” It may
be so, although he does not name his
authority, but the Daily Mail Year Book
records that a recent British submarine cost
more than £820,000, which was presumably
the estimate. Anyhow, it would take
a powerful lot of submarines to protect
the overseas shipping that trades with and
the Australian shipping that trades between
Australian ports —-8670 vessels of an aggre-
gate of 22,666,065 tons entered Australian
ports in 1923-24—and the slow-moving sub-
marine is hardly better suited for that job
than it is for climbing palms after cocoa-
nuts. And Charlton’s cheap submarines
are not to co-operate with the Bri-
tish Navy, as the R.A.N. lias been
doing since its formation; there is no men-
tion of co-operation, at all events, and Labor
is sullenly hostile to the Singapore base.
Neither are there to be military arrangements
with the British or other English-speaking
nations for mutual help in time of trouble.
Such arrangements are, in fact, to be dis-
couraged by “amendments” of the Defence
Act and the Commonwealth Constitution, the
former being designed to prevent “the rais-
ing of forces for service outside the Com-
monwealth, or participation in any future
overseas war, except by decision of the
people,” and the latter providing that “no


Australian can be conscripted for military
service overseas.” And the compulsory-
training system is to be destroyed, for the
sake of votes, by the party which brought it
into being. Australia is to return to volun-
taryism which gave it a whole 23,509 soldiers
in 1910 —to voluntaryism, with Russian im-
provements. The Russian Army has elected
officers, so officers .of the new Australian
Army are to be elected. As in Russia like-
wise there is to be “no distinction between
commissioned and non-commissioned offi-
cers” ; and oaths, courts-martial., penalties
(“except in pursuance of explicit enact-
ment”), salutes and “other useless discipline ’
are to be abolished. The employment of
soldiers in industrial disputes is expressly
forbidden, and Ministers of the Crown are
to be punished if the provision is infringed.
But “citizens on completion of training
are to retain their arms,” presumably for
use in the industrial disputes in which the
King’s Ministers may not employ any of his
soldiers, and which may develop into a Red
rising, as in S’Africa. Such is the Labor
defence policy, 1925 pattern. What a policy
and what a party !

THE COOLIE AND THE DRAGON.
General Sun Chuan-fang, Tupan of
Chekiang province, China, has just placed
an order with a Shanghai firm for 15,000
umbrellas for the use of liis soldiers. Other
indications that the Revolution is about to
resume its warlike activities are not want-
ing. General Wu Pei-fu, who was soundly
beaten in last year’s operations and subse-
quently announced his intention of retiring
permanently to a monastery and writing
verses, has gathered a small force around
him, and with the promise of some 200,000
more has been casting covetous eyes on the
w'ell-stocked arsenal belonging to a col-
league. Feng Yu-iisiang, once known as
the Christian crusader and now unani-
mously dubbed the “Red General” by the dis-
illusioned white community, is occupied in
consolidating his power in Kansu and
Mongolia, where he is building railways
and roads which will bring him in closer
touch with Soviet Russia. His original
troop of Ironsides has grown into a large
army, disciplined with a Puritan fierceness
that w'ould have astonished Oliver Crom-
well. Owing to its very- close connection
with Moscow it is stated to be the best
armed of all the contending factions.
To a German interviewer the other day
Feng stated that his immediate purpose w r as
to break the economic backbone of England
in China. The phrase was picturesque and
doubtless pleasing to the Teuton, but it left
out of account Feng’s numerous Chinese
adversaries who are anxious to break his
backbone. The most formidable of these is
Chang Tso-lin, the ex-bandit of Manchuria,
W'ho looks like a poet but is a capable admin-
istrator, has brought to his wonderfully fer-
tile province a high degree of prosperity, and
also dominates the bench of grotesque pup-
pets at Peking who call themselves the Cen-
tral Government. At one time a solitary
old woman ruled China from behind the
titanic walls of that hoary capital. When
she frowned over a thousand miles of coun-
try at a presumptuous viceroy he swallowed
gold or threw himself down a well. When
she wanted a fresh wife to help in the de-
bauching .of the boy-Emperor, the highest
families in the land sent their daughters.
To-day there are half a dozen independent
generals functioning on one and another of
the railways running out of the city, and
when the Minister for Education went on
tour not long ago he had to use an army
to oust his deputy on his return.
In view of the fact that, after 13 years
of almost continuous civil war, China’s mul-
titude of leaders are still merely waiting for
the roads to harden in order to spring at
eact other’s throats again, that no national
authority is visible under the finest micro-
scope, and that no national army or navy
exists, it is one of the paradoxes of history
that the Great Powers are at the moment
coming to China to sit in conference with
what representatives the country can scrape
together to consider the granting of conces-
sions that a year ago were described as quite
unthinkable. The phenomenon, however, is
not another illustration of the popular
maxim that everything in China stands on
its head. The root cause of this considera-
tion for a weaker country shown by the
armamented Powers lies deeper. The French
Revolution rode to security on the bayonets
of the revolutionary armies ; in China, whore
the soldier is ranked lower than the peasant,
the so-called Republic is riding to victory
on the shoulders of coolies.
The recent upheaval which has moved the
Powers to want a conference had nothing to
do with the Chinese military leaders,
although they loudly espoused the cause of
the upheavalists. It was a unanimous up-
rising of the lowly street-cleaner, the house-
boy and the factory-worker. It removed in
a moment the foundation on which Euro-
pean enterprise is based everywhere in Asia.
The English housewife in Hong Kong had
to start washing up the dishes once again,
the clubman bawled in vain for his boots, and
a sewerage system which depended on the
backs and legs of thousands of coolies ceased
entirely to function. Certainly the white
community rose nobly to the crisis, and the
British gift for extempore organisation came
valiantly to the rescue. But the little
islands of Western folk, marooned amongst
sullen, watching millions of Asiatics, could,
not go on for ever taking in each other’s
washing; and the fatal habit of ratting on
one’s neighbors, which has been a European
failing ever since the West had commerce
with the East, soon manifested itself. As
soon as it was seen that the fury of the mob
was beginning to take an anti-British direc-
tion, some of Britain’s foi’mer friends, and
even one of her former allies, hastened to
assist the process. American missionaries,
■ members of the biggest system of commer-
cialised religion in the world, accused the
British merchant of unchristian practices;
French traders transferred their businesses
from the British settlements to the dubious
security of Chinese territory; Japan threw
a sop to the agitators by announcing, her
readiness to allow her nationals to be tried
by the venal Chinese courts, according to a
semi-barbaric code, instead of in her own
consular courts.
At latest showing the boycott of every-
thing British has been so far successful that
Britain goes to the conference practically
pledged to make a number of important con-
cessions. The Revolution, in fact, has
gained its first victory by economic pressure.
Although civil war is almost bound to break
out again in a month or so, the military
manoeuvres are of slight importance beside
this spectacle of a coolie army dictating
terms to the regiments and navies of the
West. There was a time when a native
war was a cheap and profitable investment.
The European invader was invariably the
victor, and by imposing a stout indemnity
on the vanquished he stirred the lethargic
Oriental to unwonted industry, and thus
indirectly stimulated his own trade. Now
that more and more European capital is
flowing into cotton-mills, shipbuilding-yards
and soap-factories in China itself, a national
stoppage in that country is as disastrous to
the English or Yankee investor as a strike
at home.
At a time when Europe was still putting
its creed of territorial expansion into prac-
tice by grabbing alien soil, I asked a Chinese
friend how his Government could have
squatted sedately on its haunches while
Burmali, Annam, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea and
other not inconsiderable fragments of the
empire were being lopped away. “To pull
one hair from the hide of an ox does not
impair the health of the animal,” he an-
swered. Recent happerfings have given
much point to the adage.

An Old Man’s Burdens.
The embargo on Dominion loans in London
lias been lifted in consequence of the howl
of agony from the loafers gathered around
the Old Man’s doorstep; and now there is
to be an unholy scramble for “accommoda-
tion.” Few', if any, of them have troubled
to realise the extent of the difficulties, repre-
sented by bad and doubtful war debts (quite
apart from old bad and doubtful peace
debts), which crowd upon the Old Man,
These arc said to be the 1924 figures:—

Canada has disappeared from the list of
debtors, so it is assumed that it lias now T
fully paid up. Though it sent out an army
almost as large as that of the Common-
v'ealth, its war debt in London w T as very
small by comparison with ours. In addition
,T. Bull has been paying to the United
States, in principal and interest on his own
war debt, about five times as much as he
has contrived to collect from his ow r n w r ar
debtors. He has sold a great part of the
good foreign investments accumulated during
a century, and got many poor ones in ex-
change. In the year dealt with Australia
contributed nearly half the war interest
which the Old Man gathered in, but he lent it
the money to pay himself with, and also the
money to pay himself the interest on the
peace debt, and something over to go on
with. The many-storeyed fabric of Aus-
tralian finance is based on the theory that
the Old Man can do this indefinitely, and
that it is his duty to do it indefinitely. At
the same time all the schemes of short hours,
high pay and very moderate labor are based
on the childlike belief that this country is
rich and self-supporting. And the commu-
nity is divided (w T ith a very insufficient num-
ber of exceptions) between fools who say the
house is sure to stand, and knaves w'lio want
it to fall and bring civilisation w’itli it.

Many Debts and a Few Vegetables.
The struggle of theoretical persons to put
other persons who are also largely theoreti-
cal “on the land” is producing a few 7 vege-
tables and many bad debts. The returned
soldier was seized upon as a blessed asset
by politicians w r ho w'anted to pose as big
patriots, w arm-hearted sympathisers and men
with commanding ideas about land settlement
and things, and to start a boom at the same
time, and possibly put profitable land-job-
bery in the way of friends and supporters.
Some very ordinary public men thus lived on
the returned soldier for years, even as the
cannibal may make a protracted meal off his
salted or kippered victim. In considering
the amount of loan money which the record
spendthrifts of this record country “blew’ed”
within the meaning of this article, it must
be remembered that figures iare only up to
June, 1924, those for the subsequent year
and a fraction not being available, and that
they appear under the heading of “Land
Purchased for Settlement.” In a continent
where the Governments own 9132 acres of
land out of every 10,000, vast repurchases
ought to have been quite needless; but they
w T ere demanded because of the craze for put-
ting everybody as near as possible to the
few' existing great cities where soil is dearest.
The figures given as at June. 1924, were:—
Debt Under Headino “Land Purchased for
Settlement.”
Victoria .. .. £28,841,000
South Australia .. 16,765,000
Westralia .. .. 12,339,000
New South Wales .. 6,824,000
Tasmania .. .. 3,338,000
Queensland .. .. 2,873,000
£70,980,000
The money—over one-eighth of the aggre-
gate State debt—went out mostly be-
tween 1919 and 1924, the object being
to promote the “primary industries” of
the small settler. In the last year of the
period the output of agricultural produce,
cows, fowls and bees, was set down as worth
12 or 13 millions more than in the first year.
This expansion may have been due to the
loan expenditure, or it may just have hap-
pened ; for these industries are always a
variable lot. In any case it was no great
expansion; the value of manufactures (not
the gross output, but the mere value added
in process of manufacturing) grew by over
40 millions per annum in the same period.
Moreover, manufacturing didn’t add
£70,980,000 to the public debt. In fact,
there is lack of evidence that it added any-
thing. Within the last few months it has
been borne in upon the rather unassimilative
public mind that there are other differences
between the two lines of industry. Manu-
facturing is almost entirely for the local
market, and there is room for a vast deal of
enlargement before the possibilities of the
local market approach exhaustion. Land
settlement, on the other hand, has been
almost entirely directed at growing more
vegetation for export. The business thus
depends .on foreign markets, and access to
these markets depends largely on foreign
ships, and the availability of the ships
depends on the capacity of Australian
Governments to prevent foreign com-
munists stopping the ships indefinitely. . In
various English-speaking lands the preach-
ing, let alone the practice, of the Moscow
brand of revolution is good for a 10-years’
sentence. Here it is subsidised out of the
funds of compulsory unionism. The Federal
Government has already Written off, to begin
with, some millions of the “settlement”
money which it raised and sub-lent - to the
States. In addition the N. S. Wales
Ministry proposes to write off £4,000,000 for
a start, and then to get to the subject in
earnest. S. Australia speaks of a loss of
some £850,000 on three settlements, but this
doesn’t include “the huge expenditure on
the Loveday area, where an expensive system
of irrigation by concrete pipes has been in-
stalled, but where only a small number of
blocks have been taken up, nor the cost of
clearing the extensive Mclntosh area, which
is lying idle.” In Victoria the talk is about
“assured losses of great magnitude.” One-
third of Queensland’s investment is repre-
sented by practically deserted settlements.
The other two States haven’t gone into much
detail yet, but nobody is hopeful. Unfortu-
nately all this writing-off doesn’t mean that
any debt is to be paid off. The books are
merely to be faked.
Christianity and Bolshevism.
Alice Jackson is more hopeful:—
The forecast of Alan Mickle (B. 15 /10 /’ 2 5 ) would
be profoundly disturbing if his arguments were
founded on valid premises. But are they? Mr.
Mickle's main contentions are (1) that “human
civilisation seems to advance in cycles”; (2) that
“a new religion begins merely as a socialistic sys-
tem, based on emotional humanism.” Thence he
deduces (1) that the cycle of our civilisation is
probably due to be completed by a “Red” a'ge ; (2)
a parallel between Bolshevism and Christianity. But
surely civilisation marches onward, slowly, halt-
ingly, but still onward; and it could not do that
if it moved in cycles. Surely, too, the now dead
nations have advanced civilisation.
As to Mr. Mickle's second contention, that “a
new religion begins merely as a socialistic system,
based on emotional humanism,” religions do not
begin as systems of any kind. They begin where
man began. If Mr. Mickle can find the beginning
of any religion, then he can date for us that period
in the history of the cosmos when “God created
man in His own image.” It doesn’t matter what
philosophic name-tag we decide to affix to the re-
sultant movement in cosmic consciousness—a Mana-
principle, an elan vital, or what not —it conditioned
for man a home-sickness for the high places of the
spirit, a yearning to place himself in harmony with
his Creator. In this all religions begin.
Mr. Mickle finds' a parallel between the ideals of
the early Christians and those of the Bolsheviks.
I can see no such analogy. The early Christian
shared his goods with his fellow, to the end that
they might mutually devote themselves more freely
to furthering the cause of Christ's kingdom. The
only communists to whom it is fair to compare the
early Christians are the religious communists of
to-day, who also forsake self for the kingdom’s sake.
The Bolshevik, on the other hand, grabs other
people’s goods, by a campaign of ruthless violence,
to the end that he may wipe out the capitalist and
destroy the State. (In Enoel's words, the State
will “wither away” ; and Lenin, in “The State and
Revolution,” admits: “We do not all disagree with
the anarchists on the question of' the abolition of
the State as a final aim.”) What is there in common
between these aims? The one is a reaching up of
man’s soul towards perfection. The other is “bloody
baboonery.” Bolshevism disfranchises the clergy,
and is the avowed enemy of religion. It is difficult,
indeed, to trace any likeness between the teaching
of the Prince of Peace and that of Trotsky, author
of “The Defence of Terrorism,” advocate of “the
systematic use of violence.” Hear Buharin, the
“programme-maker” of Communism: “Religion is
a poison, which is being instilled into the people....
the party of the communists is a strong antagonist
of religion Religion not only leaves the people
in a state of barbarism, but it helps to leave them
in a state of slavery.” It is Buharin, too, who
declares: “How is the Communist order to be insti-
tuted? Through the dictatorship of the proletariat.
Dictatorship means a power of iron, a power that
shows no mercy to its foes.” And the Krasnaya
Gazette, official organ of the Petrograd Soviet of
Workers, Red Army and Peasants’ Deputies, over
which Zinovieff presided (August 31, 1918),
announced: “We will turn our hearts into steel....
we will make our hearts cruel, hard and immovable,
so that no mercy will enter into them, and so that
they will not quiver at the sight of a sea of enemy
blood.” Has this slavering bestiality, this movement
which is so largely engineered by apostate Jews and
atheistic Germans, anything in common with Christi-
anity and Civilisation?
Finally', we may reveal the wide gulf between Chris-
tianity' and Bolshevism by' observing the attitude of
each towards women and children. This is the
measure of man’s progress from the beast. Christian-
ity has befriended women, nurtured family life, cher-
ished children, and held sacred the bond between
mother and child. Marx, beloved of the Bolshevist,
in his “Communist Manifesto” (p. 19), advocated “the
official and open community of women.” Following
in his steps, Madame Kolontay, friend of Lenin,
author of “Communism and the Family,” is an ardent
advocate of “free” love; and Bertrand Russell, in
“The Theory and Practice of Bolshevism’’ (p. 69),
confesses: “It is necessary first to admit that chil-
dren should be delivered up almost entirely to tin:
State The drafting of children to the country
must intervene, and the whole temper of the authori-
ties seemed to be directed toward breaking the link
between mother and child.”
It is easy to trace the definite history of Bolshevism
back a couple of hundred years; but it, too, must
have its prime origin in some period of unrecorded
time. Possibly it was some such manifestation of
the beast that tends at times to ravage the racial
soul which inspired the ancient writer of Genesis to
interpret Jehovah's will in the words: “I will put
enmity between thee and the woman, and between
thy seed and her seed ; it shall bruise thy head, and
thou shalt bruise its heel.”
Nine Pounds a Month with Board
and Lodging.
“When the seamen’s miserable pay and wretched
conditions are considered, one is not surprised to
find them fighting where they think they have the
best chance of winning. The industrial state of
Britain must be indeed appalling when men can be
secured for £ 9 a month.... While I am reluctant to
enter into the merits of the seamen’s case, I have
been astonished at the utter impotence of the Bruce
Government. A hint from Mr. Bruce to the British
shipping combine that the wages should not be
reduced until the men returned to their home ports
would probably have brought the trouble to an end
long ago.”— N.S. W. Premier Lanq lashing himself
into his premeditated daily rage.
The long, dreary strike of largely non-union
persons from England against other persons
in England led to the shedding of hogsheads
of crocodile tears on behalf of the strikers,
though the crocodiles had few to spare for
the multitude of small Australian producers
who were brought to the verge of ruin. The
trouble was engineered by the. same imported
communist ruffians who habitually held up
Commonwealth Government ships, presum-
ably because the pay and conditions were the
best in the world, and habitually exempted
foreign and nigger ships from their wrath,
presumably because on some of them the
pay and conditions were the worst. Gradu-
ally it came to be fomented and encouraged
and aggravated by politicians who were mad
with unmanly terror lest the communist
goblin should fall upon them, and they should
lose their pay and perquisites, and have to
get work. Some of them almost seemed
capable of abandoning their near relations
as well as their country in the agony of self-
preservation. If the N.S.W. Premier had a
bona fide frenzy, and really regards £2 Is. 6d.
per week with board and lodging as the mon-
strous crime that he is ordered to say it is,
lie might attempt something himself with a
matter near at hand. In Lang’s own country
the farmer who grows the kind of stuff which
is exported is in somewhat the position of
the owner of deep-sea ships, inasmuch as he
can’t get quite free from outside competition.
The latest official “Labor Report” gives the
minimum wage of the N.S.W. “general hand,”
cow-milker and ploughman as 255., 30s.
and 30s. per week respectively, with board
and accommodation. That is below the British
seamen’s figure. The same authority gives
the maximum as 455., 40s. and 455. respec-
tively with board and accommodation. That
isn’t perceptibly better than the British sea-
man’s figure. The wheat industry was in-
directly subsidised last year to the extent
of much over a million pounds by conveyance
of its products on the N.S.W. railways
below cost. Yet there are no fortunes in
the business, if it is judged by the appalling
losses made on “settlement” schemes. If
Premier Lang could contrive (with a care-
ful avoidance of vague generalities, abuse,
loud roaring and hysteria) to show how these
conditions may be materially improved with-
out serious damage to industry he would be
better employed than by shouting with the
alien crowd which is trying to destroy Aus-
tralia on the pretence of helping some rene-
gade or “scab” characters who are not this
country’s funeral. At the same time, men-
tion may be made of a very wide belief
that neither Premier Lang nor his commu-
nist friends ever cared one lonesome maledic-
tion about the woes of f the British sea-
men. Apart from that mariner’s uses as
political capital of the worst kind, many
of his noisy patrons wouldn’t mind if he
was hanged.

Small Sister in the Scramble.
A forecast from an old Labor man :
Prime Minister Bruce's visit to Tasmania, which
was expected to pump enthusiasm into local
anti-Labor, apparently didn’t. At any rate, the
atmosphere is full of grumblings at the inadequacy
of his programme in its relation to Tasmania’s
needs. His failure to give the Speck’s wood-pulping
project sufficient tariff protection to induce the
promoters to make a start has undoubtedly lost
his candidates many votes, for his opponents have
not been slow to propagate the suggestion that the
Prime Minister is the “bond slave” of big newspaper
interests on the mainland! The fact that these big
interests are situated on the mainland and not in
Tasmania at once places them in the category of
things to be reprobated by all good Tasmanians,
Nats, and Labs, alike. At Burnie, the village near
which the proposed pulping plant was to have been
set up, the Priminister was severely heckled, the
most hostile of the interjections coming from local
traders.
Though both Federal leaders had fine meetings
throughout the Speck, there seems to be a growing
feeling among the trading class that Charlton is
more sympathetic towards Tas. than Bruce is. A
leading Hobart merchant, perhaps the biggest trader
in the State, was permitted to say in Hobart
Mercury (no less!) that the best thing Tasmanian
electors could do was to concentrate on returning
candidates pledged to secure justice for Tasmania
from the Commomvealth Government, irrespective
of party. It is significant that this view of the
case has been let go practically unchallenged.
As in most of the States of the Commonwealth,
Small Sister’s political tipsters are chary of com-
mitting themselves because of the fact that com-
pulsory voting is an unknown quantity. The
leaders of both parties profess to believe that com-
pulsion will benefit their particular side on November
14; but political leaders will profess to believe
anything calculated to hearten their followers.
A consideration of the chances on the past per-
formances of candidates does not offer encouragement
to the prophet, for the entrants are a very mixed
lot. In Denison Labor-member Dave O’Keefe
should hold his place against the comparatively
unknown and not over-popular Gellibran.d. Jackson,
of Bass, is opposed by two Labor men hitherto
unheard of in public life and of no very conspicuous
platform ability. Jackson looks fairly safe. Hon.
Minister Atkinson, of Wilmot, is opposed by Jensen,
formerly a Federal Minister. In a city constituency,,
where platform ability is often a deciding factor,

Jensen would probably win by a street. But he
suffers as a Labor candidate from having been a
Hughes Minister in war time and from having fallen
out of the Federal Cabinet under circumstances
which have never been fully explained. He is a
great campaign general, but it seems doubtful that
he can succeed in that territory. Either Atkinson
or one of his stable-mates, farmer Best or Captain
Newman, should hold the seat for anti-Labor. In
Darwin the Labor candidate is Henry Lane, of
whom little is known; nevertheless, the contest is
expected to be very close. Franklin has to choose
out of four: W. J. McWilliams, one-time leader of
the Federal Country party ; sitting-member Seabrook ;
and two Labor candidates, Eric Ogilvie (brother of
Tas. Attorney-General Albert Ogilvie) and a young-
ster named Thompson. The brilliant Albert Ogilvie
has put up a vigorous speaking tour in support of
the not-so-able but quite presentable Eric, but the
chances are likely to favor McWilliams. There will,
however, be nothing in the shape of a sweeping
victory for anybody in any of the Rep. contests.
For the Senate there are 12 starters for four
places. The four retiring Senators, Hayes, Millen,
Payne and Grant, are nailing their colors to the
anti-Bolsh masthead. The Independent group —
former-Senator Earle, Launceston alderman Ockerby
and Major Sampson—will poll a good many votes
between them, but Earle is not inspiring the anti-
Labor forces to any great extent in these unwarlike
days. Labor puts up five —A.W.U. organiser (and
ex-M.L.C.) McDonald, ex-Vic. Rep. Colonel Crouch,
W. E. Lloyd, several times unsuccessful A. J.
Higgins (Launceston) and Tom Wilson (recently
of Vic. Railways, formerly of Tas.). McDonald is
the best known locally and a vigorous speaker;
Wilson is able and willing; Crouch, though not
showy, is an old hand at political campaigning and
is making friends rapidly among the island’s Laborites.
Measured intellectually, the Labor group outweighs
the rest of the field. Of course, this does not
necessarily mean that Labor will win. Far from
it; for, unfortunately, though Tasmania is normally
quite as strong on Australian sentiment as any of
the States, at the present time she is hardly normal,
owing to her exasperation at the exodus of her
population to the mainland because of her Federally-
created poverty. It seems probable- that in her
existing state of worry, Tasmania will think more
of her own troubles than of anything else, Aus-
tralian or imported, and will vote mostly for the
most prolific promisers among the parochial-minded
candidates for the Senate. Personally, of course, I
vote Labor.
Wliat little protection Tasmania has from
the large States derives from the fact that
it has in the Senate the same amount of
representation as they have. Labor aims
at abolishing the Senate. If Tasmania wants
to destroy the little bit of protection it has.
it will therefore vote for the candidates of
Mr. Charlton’s party. The more enthusi-
astically it votes for them the nearer it will
bring itself to the status of a mere suburb
of Melbourne.

The Labor Freetrader Again.
James Corbett (Aramac, Q.) asks some
eivil questions:—
Tell me what Bruce and Page, whom The Bulle-
tin is supporting at this election, have done for
Australia and its industries. I’m hanged if I can
see that they have done anything. How have manu-
factures fared since Bruce had a hand in the game?
And isn’t his Government kept in office by the Free-
traders of the Country party?
Bruce was a member of the Government
which brought in the Greene tariff in 1920-
21. Owing to the long State loan drunk,
among other things, that tariff did not
realise the high hopes of the good Protec-
tionist who prepared the schedules (lie is
now a N.S.W. Senate candidate) ; still the
number of factories increased from 17,113 in
1920-21 to 20,189 in 1923-24, the latest
year recorded, and the average number of
hands employed from 386,639 to 429,990.
The increase in Queensland was only 117
factories and 1752 hands, but that State
has liad a Labor Government for 10 years,
and its railway deficit for the same period
lias reached £12,000,000. While so-called
Labor lias been heaping these burdens on
Queensland, the Bruce-Page Government
has done great things for it by interdicting
imports of black-grown sugar, arranging for
the payment of £27 a ton for the raw Aus-
tralian article, and inducing the Baldwhn
Government to grant a substantial prefer-
ence on the considerable surplus now ex-
ported to Britain. It has also negotiated
Imperial preferences on wine, hops, tobacco,
dried and preserved fruits, and the benefits
have already been felt, particularly in the
dried-fruits industry, although the Labor
party’s "communist friends have done their
best to nullify them. (Incidentally, the pre-
ferences' were refused by the British Labor
Government, the Charlton party acquies-
cing.) Also, the Bruce-Page Government
has materially increased the duties on, among
other things, woollen yarns, piece goods,
.socks and stockings, cotton goods, whisky,
gin, maize, tiles, toys and chassis, and given
increased Protection to the engineering indus-
try, the object of the new duties being to
provide additional employment for at least
25,000 more Australians within two years.
Certainly the tariff revision arrived late, as
also did the bill withdrawing the conces-
sions previously granted on goods imported
as British but mostly fabricated on the Con-
tinent, but the necessity for a scries of mea-
sures to deal with the Labor party’s turbu-
lent friends was largely responsible for that.
Just as certainly there are Freetraders in
the Country party, but their influence is
small compared with that of their Protec-
tionist leader —at all events, they cut no ice
when the tariff bills were going through.
On the other hand, there are Freetraders
and Freetectionists in the Labor party, and
owing to weak leadership and confused
thinking their influence is growing. In the
debate on the Tariff Validation Bill, Green,
M.H.R. for Kalgoorlie, whined that “under
these proposals the primary industries of
Westralia must inevitably succumb.... the
heavy imposts proposed in connection with
mining machinery will practically sound the
death-knell of that industry.” The loqua-
cious Laz'zarini, of Werriwa (N.S.W.),
“protested against the extraordinarily heavy
duty on cotton tweed, which will hit the
working-man particularly hard.” He
asserted that “not 20 yards of cotton tweed
is made in Australia to-day”—as a matter
of fact, a number of Australian manufac-
turers are competing with the cheap Asiatic
and European twrneds, and they expect to
be able to supply the Whole of the Common-
wealth’s requirements within six months —
and declared that “I will never cast a vote
in this House to place a duty on something
that is not manufactured in reasonable quan-
tities.” And Gardiner, the most rabid
Cobdenite in either House, led a Freetrade
attack on the revised tariff in the Senate,
where he is the chief Labor spokesman. “Our
tariff is crippling Australia,” he roared, and
with the assistance of Labor Senators

“Though Mr. Charlton says the Labor party stands for law and order, it has adopted an ex-
I.W.W. incendiarist as a Senate candidate, and in its Defence programme it provides a means to arm
its revolutionary supporters.”

titled to advocate Freetrade. And no doubt
they are, their party being in several minds
on that subject aq on almost every other.

It was eminently advisable to have a par-
tial wash of the face and hands of that
grubby child, Political Labor, before the
Federal elections, and that may account for
the belated activity of Premiers like Collier
and McCormack. In Queensland the pro-
posed new railway strike, in assertion of
the right of imported strike leaders to coun-
termand the orders of the Railway Commis-
sioners, has been declared off, and will re-
main off till it is on again. A verbal assur-
ance, not accompanied by any cash deposit,
has been given that instructions will be
obeyed to some extent until the next time,
that railway lines will noi longer be declared
‘ black,” and that the Premier won’t be
declared “black” himself —at least, not to
any serious extent. But even if part of the
latest layer of grime has been removed from
the infant, the real cleaning process hasn’t
commenced. The big question is about some-
filing more than the right of vicious im-
ported persons to take over Australia’s rail-
ways and shipping services, to' suspend them
and the country’s industries at intervals, and
to compound with a grudging surrender and
no apology and no loss when the game is
temporarily up. The real issue concerns
the right of these persons—dozens of them —
to be in this country at all, even though they
may profess to have lucid intervals. The
deportation matter requires to be pursued
to its logical conclusion, even if the pur-
suit be described as ‘‘victimisation” or a
“renewal of strife” or % any other name.
The position of the Queensland railways,
after 10 years of increasing job-control, is
remarkable enough to furnish a lesson. The
financial difference, or change for the worse,
between last; year and the final year of sane
management (1915) was over £1,000,000.

“Rio”: Those who contend that Australia
can be adequately defended by a few squad-
rons of aircraft should ask themselves why
France, with the largest air force on earth,
is making such a mess of things in Morocco
and Syria. In both places the flying condi-
tions are excellent and the ground well
known, while the enemy is only semi-civilised
and comparatively poorly supplied with
munitions. Months ago the cables said that
French ’planes and machine-guns had the
Druses beaten, while the Riffs were having
SOOO bombs a day dropped on them ; yet both
are still going strong. The fact is that the
failure of aircraft in these operations has
been the sensation of the year in the War
Ministries of Europe. Spain has had the
same experience, while Britain in Iraq and
India has also found the limitations of air-
craft. The moral is that while aircraft are
valuable auxiliaries, and no doubt in the
future will play an increasingly important
part in defence, at present they are no sub-
stitute for man-power or for capital ships-
of-war, and the nation that weakens these to
rely on aircraft is courting disaster.

“Nakhoda” : The true reason for the
Queensland Labor Government’s sudden affec-
tion for the Abrams electronic mumbo-
jumbo (B. 5/11/’25) is political, not scien-
tific. Marky, the glib .N’York journalist
who has been pulling its leg, is the editor
of one of the most radical papers in U.S.A.
In his lectures in Australia he led off with
a furious attack on the capitalist press of
this country, which wms united with the
registered medical fraternity in a conspiracy
to prevent the common people hearing of
Abrams. He next turned a spate of vicious
eloquence against Australian doctors w T ho,
refusing to use the Abrams machine, pre-
ferred to rob the poor by practising anti-
quated methods on the down-trodden and
inarticulate proletariat. This sentimental
fluff brought tears to every heart, and tne
hungry light that gleamed in many an eye
dulled by disease was a feature of his audi-
ences. No wonder the sort of politician who
is ready callously to exploit popular hopes
about the Spahlinger tuberculosis treat-
ment didn’t scruple to make capital out ot
this appeal to class prejudice! But what
are the facts? Any medical practitioner who
finds the paths of orthodoxy flinty may order
an Abrams machine, and make a, fortune in
a year. His progress will be strewn with
corpses—there have already been fatalities
in Australia directly traceable to false
Abrams diagnoses—and lie may be kicked
out of the profession; but there will be no
danger of him ever touching bottom in the
sea of human gullibility. It says a good deal
for the registered cliirurgeons on this side
that, with the exception of one specimen who
was found out in Maorilaiul, none of them
seem to have taken the easy route to riches;
in U.S.A. and Britain there have been
plenty.

“Rubaidh” : An American explorer, Rot
Chapman Andrews, has returned with great
spoil from an expedition to the Gobi desert;
and the proclamation has been loudly made
through the cables that life originated in
that wild part of Asia. Boiled down, the
cable message, after the first loud flourish,
merely states that people like the Red
Indians of North America once lived in
Gobi, and that traca; of human beings
20,000 years old have been found. The
actual age of such remains is always diffi-
cult to fix; but in any case 20,000 years
does not get anywhere near the beginning
of things. A civilisation 20,000 years old
would be remarkable, though its discovery
would hardly be an epoch-making event.
Comparative stone-age civilisation, with rudi-
mentary weaving, pottery and agriculture,
existed in Europe at least 12,000 years ago ;
so the mere existence of man in Gobi
20,000 years ago only proves that what is
now a desert was once inhabited, not by any
means that it is the cradle of the race. _ So
remote in point of time are the beginnings
of man that the Gobi people are mere
moderns compared with the little fellow who
wore the skull recently unearthed in Africa.
Possibly, however, the cable is muddled and
only refers to the cradle ,of the American
race.
«
“Borom” : To such dimensions has the busi-
ness done on the l, lay-by” system grown that
it begins to call for regulation by law. _ To
the seller the method has many obvious
superiorities over time-payment, which it is
fast supplanting, the chief being that it
reduces the risk of loss to a minimum, since
the purchaser does not secure possession of
the goods until the latter have been com-
pletely paid for. In addition the vendor
obtains the use of large sums interest free ;
and should a customer default or for some
reason cease to keep up the payments, the
amount in hand is so much clear profit, no
money being returned. The advantages to
the other party are not so apparent. About
all that she (it is oftenest she) gets out of
it is that she earmarks an article for her
own before she has the money to pay for it.
One serious feature is that should the vendor
go broke or quit business before the _ pay-
ments are completed, the customer is in
danger of losing everything. This has actu-
ally happened on several occasions lately,
and in each instance those who have suffered
financially have been people of the sort to
whom the loss, comparatively trifling as it
might be, has been a serious matter.

Settlement under irrigation is making
steady progress in Victoria, where the system
supplies water to an area of 22,214 square
miles, containing 193 towns, and serves a
population of 355,370. Storage capacity has
now reached 871,610 acre feet, an increase
since 1902 of nearly 700,000 acre feet. The
pride of the system is the Wimmera-Mallec
supply. The aggregate storage is 152,350
acre feet, which within the next two years
will be increased to 200,000 acre feet; the
area served is 11.000 square miles, and dur-
ing last season 4950 miles of channels were
kept going to supply towns and settlements.
The Millewa scheme, still in its infancy, is
designed to supply water for domestic and
stock purposes to over 1,000,000 acres,
About 350.000 acres have been reticulated,
and 421 blocks allotted to new settlers. An
example of the rapid growth of settlement
under irrigation conditions is the Bawawm
estate, near Rochester. In 1910, when the
estate was bought, it maintained 21 families
on 13,400 acres, ' dry farming. To-day it
supports 176 families, and the population of
the district is 1182 ; and the record is all the
better because the settlers had to face the dry
season of 1914-15 before they had found
their feet.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Priminister Coates's easy triumph at the
Maoriland elections made Matthew Charlton
look more dejected than ever. The figures
indicate that Coates will have a 4-to-l majo-
rity over the Labor party, which is dazed
at the immensity of its defeat. Maoriland
has shown what it thinks of Red strikes and
Pink Laborites with white livers; it is
now up to Australia.
That spasmodic thing, the embargo on new
(not renewal) Australian loans in London, is
off again for the time, and six States are
rushing to get another £18,600,000 in debt.
Apparently the Old Man tried a strike, and
failed. New loans take no money out ot
the country, for the millions are handed back
as interest, but J. Bull seems to have hoped
that his thriftless sons would contrive, under
pressure, to pay with cash instead of with
an additional pile of lOU’s, so that some
money would come into the country. But
it was poor old Dad’s mistake. .He hoped
for too much. The really disgusting feature
of the case, though, is that the loafers will
continue to throw chests and talk about
their sturdy independence.
The Fremantle strike began to crack up
just as soon as the terrorised State Govern-
ment was driven to put a few dozen men
on the job of preventing insult and outrage.
In those Queensland ports where the pro-
ducers took a hand in defence of their
property the aggressive hordes also
crumpled up. It is often a mistake, as
Fluellen proved, to take violent persons at
their face value. Johanson, when really up
against possible trouble after months of con-
tumacy, threw himself on the mercy of the
Court with almost indecent haste, and if the
Court hadn’t been so weakly generous with
its mercy he might be throwing himself yet.
Tom Walsh, in his first incarnation, when
he was staging a revolution in Melbourne,
met with a matter-of-fact “beak” who said
the sentence would be three months. And
the results were gratifying in that case too.
One of the intentions of the Prime Minis-
ter is to give unions power to control their
own affairs instead of being ordered about
in slave fashion by union or strike bosses —
in other words, they are to be allowed to
ballot on strikes and other important mat-
ters But more than that will be necessary.
At Cairns the disturbers, including persons
with strange names and strange whiskers
and a foreigner with a revolver, permitted
a ballot by special request from high quar-
ters A good majority was against the strike,
but it went on iust the same, because the
minority was violent, and there was no
lynching organisation in the hen
a body of farmers, who objected to the hold-
up of their produce, took a hand, the
majority got to work, aud tlie minority, after
a poor show of violence, got under shelter.
The strike chairman apologised and resigned,
and the armed foreigner was deprived of his
gun aud locked up. It was at least a
partial change for the better, and Premier
McCormack took heart, and began bo let off
a little stage-thunder.
In the end Johanson shows up better than
Walsh. When the seamen’s strike was
fizzling out Walsh struggled to get the dupes
into a new union, and thus give him a chance
to put the knife into his personal enemy,
Havelock Wilson. Johanson, having no pur-
pose of that sort to serve, wanted them to
go back to their union and reform it from
within, if it wasn’t what it ought to be.
lie didn’t want to have anything to do with
a “scab” union. It ought to make Austra-
lian labor unions thoughtful. They have
been supporting people who have broken
away from their union and have done their
best to damage it. It won’t be pleasant for
good Australian unionists to wake up pre-
sently to the fact that they have been sup-
porting union-wreckers.
Senator Gardiner has carried on like a
lost soul about the delay in dealing with
Walsh’s case:—
llow long will Mr. Bruce continue the inhuman
cruelty of keeping Mr. Walsh, his wife and children
in suspense? Is he holding his hand for election-
eering purposes ? If so, how’ cruel and cowardly!
The “suspense” is in the matter of Walsh’s
departure for England, where he professes
to be going, anyhow. Senator Gardiner,
meanwhile, has promised, given a Labor
majority, to get the Prime Minister con-
victed of some crime or other before a per-

fectly illegal tribunal. The cowardice a
J. T. Lang, N.S.W Premier and suburban
estate agent, butted persistently into th,
Federal election contest, and did little good
0 o? wfnaSaliJS
was to the effect that Prime Minister Bruce
patched up a partial settlement of the next-
to-last marine dispute on condition that the
Clan Monroe was allowed to discharge its
cargo, and did so because it brought German
goods for Paterson, Laing and Bruce. Hol-
loway, of the Trades Hall Council, chairman
of the conference which settled that trouble,
says the ban was lifted off the Clan Monroe
not because the Prime Minister interfered,
but because the ship carried a colored crew.
That looks very much as if Holloway called
Lang an Ananias, and it also shows the ad-
vantage of employing nigger seamen on
vessels coming to White Australia when
communists are about.
That unwanted infant, child endowment,
was quietly smothered by the Queensland
Government. At the opening of the session in
July, Gillies, then Premier, made a great
parade of what he was going to do for the
mothers and children of the community, and
Labor's trumpeters blared that Queensland
was leading the world. A sub-committee of
the Cabinet was appointed to draft the
scheme, but the actual work was done by A.
B. Piddington. The union bosses announced
that they didn’t want child endowment; they
wanted higher wages. The railway strike
drove this point home, and child endowment
was dropped. There never was any sincere
intention of adopting Piddington’s scheme;
the financial requirements staggered even
the happy-go-lucky financiers of the Labor
’ Party.
If the Bruce-Page team scores a victory
on Saturday, the Allan-Peaeock (t ie.)
Cabinet will show a bolder front to Labor
and display less forbearance to lukewarm
supporters. It is masking the irritation it
now feels at such rebuffs as it has been
receiving on the Forests and Stock Foods
Bills till after the Federal poll. Given a
decisive win for Bruce, Allan will tell the
House in so many words to do its worst.
Kidman and Wren: —
The writer has no brief for Kidman, but if that
*•*-
the noisy muckrakers who allege that he has scaled
the country for land-tax amounting to £136,000,
and that the Government connived at the “scaling,”
it will be only what they deserve. The facts are
that a Labor Government, m a stupid attempt to
get home on the pastoralists, decided that Crown
leases should be subject to the Federal land-tax.
It soon became evident that no Taxation Commis-
sioner could accurately determine the unimproved
value of pastoral land held under an evanescent
tenure in a continent subject to drought. The
attempt became ridiculous during the cattle slump,
when one Federal Government department was paying
cattlemen (the Queensland Labor Government in-
cluded) bonuses on the export of live and dead meat
and another was sending them land-tax assessments
that ran to more than they could sell their leases
for. The collection of the tax was suspended, as
a hopeless proposition, in 1918, but the assessments
went on till 1923. N.S.W. Judge Edwards, report-
ing as a Royal Commissioner, comes in here: —
Although Kidman has not paid any tax on Crown
leasehold for eight years, he has paid so much in
the past that, if his valuations are sustained, the
Commissioner will be in debt to him to the extent
of a few thousand pounds. A number of landholders
who hold Crown leases are in the like position. Until,
therefore, a satisfactory basis of valuation is arrived
at it is impossible to say how much is really
owing. There is litigation by the Commissioner
against Kidman, and the matter is sub judice.
After all, Kidman went out into the bush and laid
the foundation of his fortune by hard work. That
is more than can be said for the Labor party’s
patron Wren, who became wealthy—much wealthier
than Kidman, who, in fact, is now by no means
very rich —by exploiting the weakness of the workers
for gambling. Yet the loudest detractors of Kidman
are the most abject of crawlers to Wren.
The badly-steered N.S.W. ship of State
struck a nasty reef over the 15)17 railway
strike. It ordered the Railway Commis-
sioners, without any legal authority, to de-
grade the men who obeyed orders in that
memorable year. Then the Equity Court,
being applied to, declared the business quite
unlawful, and, pending legal authority, t'.iere
was nothing for it but to promote the loyal-
ists again. So they have their ups and
downs. If anyone had developed sufficient
originality to move the Court for a declara-
tion that the Casual Vacancies Act had
expired, and that the vacancy created by
the death of Birt, M.L.A., could only be filled
by a by-election, he might Have produced
even more surprising results and made an
end of the Lang Ministry. But it wasn t
the Opposition’s day for being original.
Unlimited cheek is no small asset. The
N.S.W. Premier undertook to reduce the
railway employees who didn't strike in 1917,
and promote those who did. He defined
those who disobeyed orders as “old and
faithful servants of the Department.” His
raking up of an eight-year-old animosity he
alluded to as an attempt to restore harmony
and goodwill. Having ordered the Railway
Commissioners to commence the degradation
of non-strikers without process of law for
obeying the Commissioners' lawful orders,
and the Commissioners having done so lest
the rage \of the common tyrant should be
turned on them, fresh complications arose.
The Law, being appealed to, decided that
Lang was quite unlawful, whereupon the
Premier performed like a cat in fits about
what he called his opponents’ “illegal acts
and “ruthless vindictiveness.”
South Aus. has taken over half a century,
since allowing the deceased wife’s sister
alliance, to realise that deceased husband s
brother is on the same footing; but the
gentleman has now been allowed as a legal
privilege what the law of Moses declared a
solemn duty. The former Act contains a
little extra provision that few people kiiow
is there, making the deceased wife’s niece
also possible ®s her legal successor. When
the measure was originally introduced to S.
Aus. it was hailed pleasantly as “the Blank
Relief Bill,” Blank being a legislator who
was known to be anxiously awaiting the
opportunity the extra clause allowed.
The Sydney municipal employee, or the
municipal contractor's employee, has to be-
long to a union, though lie may be ejected
from it with no form of trial, and then dis-
qualified as a worker for not belonging. In
this matter he is in the same boat as the
N.S.W. Government employee. He is called
upon to pay a levy in support of the Labor
paper, whether he likes the publication or
not. In addition, every municipal employee
has been requested during the election cam-
paign to part with some money to help
Labor candidates to get in, and the employee
has every reason to suspect that if he doesn t
acquiesce in the blackmail he will be helped
to get out. Even the mild and long-suffering
Australian will probably revolt one of these
days; but he is a long while about it. '
Queensland Laborites find the Govern-
ment Printing Office very useful for issuing
electioneering literature It comes cheaper
that way, and the Government Printer's
name on it gives the most violent party pro-
paganda an official appearance. The latest
production of Anthony Cumming’s publish-
ing-house is a 20-page pamphlet by E. G.
Theodore: “At the Bar of Public Opinion—

Still neither Bruce nor Page has yet been
arraigned at the bar of public opinion or else-
where for creating a new job at £2OOO a

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The strike of the British seamen-—against their
own union—is long since over in Britain and the
other dominions; in Australia it still drags on
because of the sympathy and assistance given to
the strikers by the Labor Governments of several
States, among which the Lang Government is promi-
nent.” —Customs Minister Pratten.
Sullen and mute you sat, you who were sworn
Law to uphold, and lawlessness to stem.
Men waited for your words from morn to morn ;
What though authority was set at scorn,
You never dai'ed condemn.
Ships swung beside the quays in helpless plight,
Or rocked upon the harbor, idle, still,
While men misguided waged a hopeless tight.
Who could have saved them from themselves? You
might.
You only lacked the will.
Disorder raged about you- —dire duress—
Disloyal passion’s roar and treachery’s reek
Struggle foredoomed to failure—useless stress
And you who knew (none better) its hopelessness
Too timorous to speak!
Neutral —though cargoes in the holds should rot—-
Cringing, half-hearted, even when riot came,
Wringing your flaccid, nerveless hands, God wot,
As ’twere in impotence! Now, had they not
Been better wrung in shame?
False to your trust, forsworn in trial’s hour,
Here is your record—and your requiem:
When Law was set at nought, you shirked your
power,
You could but quibble and condone and cower,
You never dared condemn!

Its an ill wind that blows no good to this
remarkable co.; which really is only another
way of saying that it is managed with such
consummate skill that it is able to turn to
profit what in the hands of a less capably
handled concern would mean a heavy loss.
For instance, anything might have happened
when the production of Australian sugar
outgrew Australia’s needs; for at the present
moment, owing largely to the enormous in-
crease in the world’s sugar production (it
has moved from 94 million tons in 1903 to
234 million tons in the past season), the
f.o.b. value of the exportable surplus in the
open market would be about £8 per ton.
Two things “happened,” however (it is
wonderful how things do just “happen”)
an arrangement was made by which a high
price was fixed in Australia, and Britain
granted a. handsome preference to Australian
sugar. The amazing feature is that the high
price fixed in Australia was struggled for
hardest not by the Fat man, but by Labor
politicians inside and outside of Parliament;
for this was a case in which they were able
to realise that the more booty there was the
more hope there would be for labor to get
a big cut. Certainly the present arrange-
ment is comparatively short-lived; but
C.B.R. shareholders don’t worry much about
that—the pilot who has taken them to port
so often is trusted now to take them in
again when the time comes. Meanwhile
nobody need take any one half-year’s
figures very seriously. The directors
have established such a reputation for put-
ting a bit by to cover the mistakes they don’t
make that when they show in a year profits

nearly equal, that is, to another 5 p.c.—
the position can be safely regarded as pretty
good. In fact, the chairman, who can find
a leaden lining to most clouds, is willing to
admit that the position in Fiji is much im-
proved in several respects. And the extent
of the business in Fiji and elsewhere outside
Australia may be more or less judged by the
fact that the proportion of the dividend sub-
ject to Australian Federal income-tax is only
564 p.c.

There arc still some people who think a
bank can tell to a penny what profit it has
made in a half-year. Really it can do no-
thing of the kind. Two or three years ago
a bank may have started to finance a draper;
and the business may have seemed so pro-
fitable that term by term the bank may have
credited itself with the interest on the
advance. Actually it may never have got
any money; on the contrary, the advance
may have steadily increased with the trader’s
increasing business. And then Tom Walsh
may have hung up ship after ship laden with
goods upon which the business depended, and
the trader may have lost his chance of selling
his race hats and frocks, and at last
the goods arrived it would be to meet a
market swamped with the goods of a hun-
dred other traders similarly placed. In the
circumstances the bank’s customer might find
it impossible to carry on; and the bank's
loss might quite easily wipe out all the profit
which it had thought it had made on that
account since it was first opened. Many a
Melbourne bank believed that it was making
most handsome profits in 1890 and 1891;
then it suddenly woke up to find not only
that those profits were quite illusory, but
that it had lost most of its capital into the
bargain—lost it on those very transactions
out of which it had thought it was making
fine profits.
There are periods in the history of every
bank when what looks like some heavy loss
is ascertained —a loss which, though now
ascertained, was really made perhaps a year
before, perhaps seven years before; when,
that is, the bad business was taken. Apart
from the heavy loss, the bank may be just
then doing extraordinarily well ; and the
people who have gradually made the un-
written laws of British and Australian bank-
ing long ago decided that it would not be
a fair thing to either the proprietors or the
customers-—lenders and borrowers alike—to
exhibit those large variations in profits which
would be shown if the profits of one half-
year were wholly debited with one or two
big losses ascertained in that term. A bank
lives mainly upon its credit; and credit is
seriously affected by such variations. Hence
came about the practice of establishing inter-
nal reserves or contingency accounts —profits
or what might turn out to be profits put
by in order to meet unexpected losses. And
from this again has developed the practice
of disclosing just enough profit to indicate to
shareholders what in the opinion of the Board
is the trend of the bank’s business. In the
case of this Royal Bank, for instance, every
half-year. for several years past the profits
have moved up a little—-a suggestion that
the business was steadily developing and
meeting with no unexpected reverses. Now,
however, there has been a sudden shrinkage
in disclosed profit; and the only explanation
offered is that exchange earnings are low at
the moment. They were exceptionally high
a year or so back; but there was no indica-
tion of it in this batik’s accounts. The ex-
planation is thin. What the shrinkage pro-
bably means is something like this: “Busi-
ness, though still highly profitable, isn’t
quite as good as it was; and between one
thing and another —chiefly political—we are
not so sure of the future as we were. We
doubt whether in the past we have made
sufficient provision for unpleasant con till -
gencies. We will therefore make the posi-
tion a bit stronger by declaring less profits
than hitherto.” In other words, the chances
seem to be that the bank is going to pay more
attention for a time to its internal than
to its visible reserves.
The balance-sheet figures themselves show
no changes of much consequence:—

The position is stronger, and for that very
reason the immediate profit-making capacity
is a bit less. As for some years past, the
capital is in £4 shares, some fully paid, some
paid to £1; and the market has been looking
for an increase. There is nothing in the
accounts to show that new capital is urgently
necessary; and the reduction of the disclosed
profit may be a hint to shareholders that
the directors want to build up the internal
strength before they do anything the other
way.

During the term capital was increased to
£200,000 (£lB2l unpaid at balancing date)
by the issue of 50,000 £1 shares. The
healthy profits won during the 12 months
were more than equal to the higher
call. But the eye can easily dwell
too long on last year’s profits. Not
only did the wool market do some previously
unheard of stunts, but Malice and Western
Vic. lands have been indulging in a boom
on their own account. Some of the Mallee
lands in which Mr. Lascelles, one of the
founders of this co., was so keenly interested,
and which would have been thought dear
at £1 an acre 30-odd years ago, has lately
been sold at £l4 an acre. On recent results
it is no doubt worth it; but some of the
new men are going to find the burden pretty
heavy if they are struck with a couple of
bad years in succession.
In view of the circumstances of last year
just mentioned a big jump in gross income
was to be expected:—

Progress had been slow, but fairly steady up
to last year. Expenses, however, have been
racing upward, and to cut them back to con-
form with earnings in poor years is nearly
always difficult. The 1924 agreement with
Henry Wills and Co., of Perth and Fre-
mantle, for the conduct of wool sales in
Westralia, was terminated;. Apart from that,
general expansion was visible in balance-sheet
figures':—

Of the £126,912 increase in liabilities, bank
overdraft accounted for £57,000. Small addi-
tions were made to premises, but the chief
increase was in advances. That was to be
expected. The financial position was com-
fortable on June 30, and subsequent sales
have probably disposed of much if not all
of the carry-over wool and eased the posi-
tion to a corresponding degree.

Only twice since the business was passed
to a public co. have shareholders had less
than 10 p.c., although the one-in-three gift
issue of 1920 softens the latest blow, as it did
that of June, 1921. And the outlook is none
too cheerful; between dumping from over-
seas, strikes, keen competition due largely
to low exchanges, especially in France, a
poor wheat harvest and now the 44-hour
week, N. S. Wales manufacturers face a dis-
turbed future. Last year there was a fall-
ing-off in belting business, and that, added
to other adverse factors, made for the poor
return. In the twelvemonths the extensions
to city warehouse and to the factory were
completed. Apart from the effect of that,
movements were unimportant:—

The co. was formed to acquire the Grand
(unlicensed) and its old neighbor the White
Hart. Prefs. have now received 1921-22
divs. and 2 p.c. for 1023—not so bad con-
sidering that the co. has been spending most
of the time and a pot of money in modern-
ising its property, which it took over in June,
1020. Practically the last of the general re-
construction was completed in 1924. and the
vyny is now clear for uninterrupted business.
An encouraging growth of patronage in the
teeth of rather fierce competition is disclosed
by gross profits: £60,012 in 1923. £70,882
in 1924, and £85,022 last year. Expenses,
of course, have not been stationary; at
£i7,759 last year they were £7326 greater
than in 1924, which in turn was £9354
higher than in 1923. A stop must be put to
that. And that is mainly a question of
management, the determining factor in resi-
dential-hotel businesses. Last year £5297
was charged to depreciation, and, with £5OOO
previously set aside, was written off equip-
ment. As “furniture, plant and equipment”
was given a value of £41.230 the allowance
seems liberal enough, though without a
thorough investigation no opinion on that
point is worth much. Additions and altera-
tions to the premises have, of course, been
charged to capital. Each year an amount
has been written off preliminary exes., the
final £(5O being wiped out last year; but
goodwill of £6600 still figures in the’ accounts.
Here is a comparison of balance-sheet

Improvement seems to have been made, but,
it is too slight so far to affect the position,
f reeholds carry a mortgage of £64.600 and
other liabilities are heavy. Liquid and semi-
fiqmd assets were little more than sufficient
U l toe open accounts. Of paid capital
of £1,>0,000, £BO,OOO is in 8 p.c. cum. prefs.,
each share being secured by net tangibles
with a book value of 335. lOd. Divs. for the
past two years and 6 p.c. of the 1923 lot
are still unpaid, and that accumulation has
to be wiped off before ordinaries come into
the picture.

South Brisbane Gas and Light Co.,
f r 'Ti was tlie ond °f last November before
the old trouble was finally settled and a new
Board installed. Its job was not one you’d
rush. The horizontal retorts, besides being
out of date, were in a bad way. To repair
them would have cost too much.; so the ver-
ticals which had been standing idle for years
were placed in position, and results are said
to be improving. Services called for urgent
attention, too. Many were blocked and
others had too many consumers on them.
Most demands for extensions had to be for
the time being refused, the Board consider-
ing that the problem to settle first was pro-
duction. Additional plant is still necessary.
Aew condensers and a new holder must be
01 octod j and that is not all. To carry out
the scheme it has prepared the Board will
have to ask for new capital.
Gas sales for the year were £5745 more,
wlule manufacturing costs moved up only
£3311. After writing off an unspecified
amount for depreciation and making the
provision demanded by the Gas Act, the net
profit was £5362, compared with £2753 for
the previous, year. With £5119 brought into the
accounts £10,481 was available. But in the
reconstruction provision had already been
made to eat up £6872 of it in reduction of
capital;. ordinaries were given 7 p.c. for the
year, prefs. their 6 p.c. from date of con-
version, and £950 was carried forward. The
outlook is brighter, but new capital is neces-
sary to allow the co. to take advantage of
the business offering. And there is no wis-
dom in dawdling: gas has too keen a com-
petitor to permit of that. Capital on June
30 was £98,493 in 280,000 ordinaries of
2s. 6d. each and 126.987 prefs of 10s. When
the £36,506 of stock is converted pref. capi-
tal will amount to £lOO,OOO. The recon-
struction gave the Board power to raise
further prefs. ranking pari passu or in prior-
ity to existing prefs.

Little wonder that established tin pro-
ducers are iu favor. According to figures
quoted by F. G. Pratten, visible supplies on
October 30, on London reports, amounted to
15,402 tons, a decrease of 2017 tons as com-
pared with a mouth earlier, and 4000 com-
pared with September, 1924. Consumption
for October was declared to be 9654 tons,
while supplies from all sources amounted to
only 7637 tous.

Almost forgotten Oversight and Tara
leases, at Broad Arrow (W.A.), were
credited with another good return the other
day. These shows furnished spectacular
yields off and on for some years, but little
has been heard cf them lately. An Adel-
aide co. held them for a while during the
Hampton boom, but gave up after a few
months’ unprofitable work. Then a party of
miners who knew something successfully
bogged in.

Jock Thompson has brought good news to
Perth from distant Braeside silver-lead field
(W.A.). A Government expert reported last
year that Braeside outcrops were continuous
for miles, and contaiued iu places up to 85
p.c. lead. Thomson now reports that on
one show, Ragged Hill, sft. of galena, aver-
aging 80 p.c. lead and 940 z. silver, is being
broken and bagged, and that lift, of high-
grade carbonates has also been exposed. He
adds that, if values live down, Braeside
will employ a few thousand men by and bye,
and perhaps become the Barrier of West-
ralia. The State is backing Jock to a small
extent, and Sydney has promised to take a
hand if inducements offer.

Wcstralia’s speculating public is not too
pleased with the reported terms of the
Wiluna float; references to it as a glaring
case of greed are frequent. London has
been trying to plug the Australian public
with as many of the 300,000 contribs. as
possible, but outside Ivalgoorlie it has not
liad a warm reception. Meantime, in expec-
tation of a successful flotation, wild cats
are multiplying fast in the Wiluna district,
and early attempts are likely to be made to
put off worthless blocks in Adelaide.
* * * *
London is awaiting confirmation of the
repoi-t that oil flotation is successful before
making a move to modernise plants and con-
solidate operations at Ivalgoorlie. Yarns are
being spread about satisfactory results, but
so far the acid-test of bulk-handling does not
appear to have been applied. Meanwhile
the struggle to in-ofitably work the veterans
of the field continues.

Associated’s Canadian ventures still pros-
per. One, the Keeley silver-mines, Ontario,
has just paid another half-yearly 8 p.c.
div. and a bonus of 4 p.c., and the other
in the same province, the Vipond, is doing
as well. At August 31, Iveeley’s liquid assets
were valued at over lj million dollars.

Devon Co. (W.A.) is having an argument
with its late manager. He says he gave up
because “it was impossible to carry on with
an obsolete, woni-out and mostly disabled
plant.” He declares that the roaster and
other additions proposed by the Board will
only aggravate the situation with the re-
mainder of the plant in its present condition.
“Surely the managers, including myself,
who have come and gone during the past few
years, are not all duds,” he adds, by way of
clinching his argument.

Adelaide is talking of a ufew issue Of
bonus shares by North Broken Ilill. Ob-
viously present record profits would easily
permit the payment of substantial dividends
on a much larger capital than the present
£700,000 and bring the market price of the
shares down to a more convenient figure
than £7 or so. But the question is whether
the market has not already discounted a
bonus of this sort, knowingly or not, by
pushing the shares up to that level.

Zinc Corp. disappointed the market with

Mill erection at Mt. Patterson. Attunga
(N.S.W.), is a slow process. Managing-
director Graham found the steep peak of the
mount an obstacle to delivery of the heavier
units of the Mt. Dudley mill. The new year
may, however, see the plant in action.
* * * *
W. A. Duly, a director of New White Cry-
stal (N.S.W.), and for over 20 years mill
manager at Baker’s Creek, overhauled the
former mine lately. Basing his estimate on
the 4 p.c. got from 2000 tons treated, he
advised the erection of the additional 10 head
now on the mine, so that 2200 tons might
be put through per month. He reckons that
could be done for 12s. per ton ; and on that
he figured a profit of £l7OO. It is a low-
grade show; and the difference between
profit and loss is a matter of handling—and
the metal market. The latter is as good as
the most hopeful can expect it to ever be.

“F.C.C.”: Recent comments of The
Bulletin emphasise the need of greater care
being exercised when drilling for oil in Aus-
tralia. And the experience of a co.
operating near Mt. Gambier (S.A.) gives
additional emphasis. This co. commenced
drilling with an American in charge. On
account of slow progress, he was superseded
by another American. lie drilled 2000-odd
feet. At 1960 feet, it is stated by several
men on the job, there was a strong showing
of oil and gas; but it was not reported on
the log. Moreover, at this depth the rotary
drill was moved slowly up and down for
hours, thus puddling the hole. The manager
went to another State, and his co. thereafter
had a continuous hard-luck story of broken
casing and lost tools. In comparison, I
would cite the work done by an Australian
drilling co. for the Mersey Valley Co. near
the southern border of Vic. and S.A. With
only Australians on the job. there has been
no broken casing and no fishing for tools.
Yet the strata called for the highest efficiency
in drilling methods. These facts probably
demonstrate that Australians are the better
drillers —in Australia, anyway.
* * * *
“Kerogen”: The groueli of “Real Aus-
tralian” (B. 8/10/’25) is more than justified.
Why Dr. Wade, after recommending a test
of the Hunter River (Belford) dome struc-
tures for their natural gas possibilities,
ignored the second-largest flow of high-grade
natural gas in the Commonwealth, at Lake
Bunga, is inexplicable. From its composi-
tion the gas is decidedly not of brown-coal
origin, but in all probability represents a
product of decomposition of the marine fauna
in the associated tertiary sediments. While
this does not necessarily mean oil elsewhere
in the series, it certainly does mean that the
gas deposits are likely to be extensive,
apparent lack of structure precluding any
likely concentration of it in restricted areas.
The fact that Bunga has produced 12,000,000
cubic feet of high-grade gas from a “wild
cat” well under the great pressure of 5001 b.
per sq. in. is an indication that, were
the job done properly and thoroughly, _ with
water shut off, just as in routine oilwell
drilling, much bigger flows are likely. The
loss of an amount of gas equivalent to 500
tons of good Newcastle coal may be nothing
to the bureaucrats controlling this country s
destiny, but what a howl there would have
been had 300 tons of good crude petroleum
(its approximate oil equivalent) gone up
into the ait from any bote ill Australia!
The attention of the Vic. Electricity Com-
mission should be drawn to the fact that
a source of power, cheap and continuous,
may yet be iifecessary to supplement that at
present derived from tvliat inhst .qe the Worst

Another favorable development is re-
ported at Sardine Tin, Kangaroo Hills (Q.).
There was talk lately of a resumption of divs.
before Christmas as a result of the improve-
ment on the third and fourth levels, and
that prospect should be improved by last
week’s discovery of 4ft. of 20 p.c. ore m

Taranaki’s Tarata bore is down 3725 fr.;
it ran into softer formation at 3b9sft.
Motorua bore lias been drilled to 2150 ft.
“with a nice show of oil.” The B:}in. casing
has been run right down, and after it has
been cemented the well will be baled to test
the show.

A radio from the manager of Mandated
Development reports that No. 3 hove at
Matapau had been drilled to 150 ft. and
eased to 148 ft. “Prospects look very favor-
able for a larger production ot oil with
greater depth” is the opinion of the manager.
Indications at Matapau seem to be as favor-
able as at any spot in New Guinea. But the
market will be more or less disinterested m
all the local floats until news of a gusher
flashes across the ether.

Tanah Biji (F.M.S.), the most mysterious
of the tin-dredging brood, has incubated a
chick called the Jellapang. The news hltered
through to Sydney that this co. had been
registered in Malaya with a capital ot
£120,000, 55,000 20s. vendors’ shares being
accompanied by 65,000 contribs. of winch
only 1000 came to Sydney for subscription.
Location of the area is not given, but A. P.
Penman attests that its 330 acres contain
0,000,000 cubic yards of “easily dredgable
material” going lib. ho the yard, and
11,000,000 yards of 12oz. stuff. A bucket
dredge with 130,000 yards monthly capacity
is spoken of. The parent co. receives 30,000
fully paids and £3500 for exploring and
boring.
Alluvial Tin, Malaya, states that its
Malin Nawar Co. should have its plant under
steam in December. Malin Nawar South
dredge material is on the site, and erection
is proceeding. Kuala Kampar dredge
material will all be assembled on the site
during November. Tanjong Tualang dredge
lias been shipjied and should arrive at its
future address early in December. Shares
in all these concerns are at a heavy premium.

A NEW COMPLIMENT.
THE WIFE : “I’ve got a lot of things I want to talk to
you about.”
THE BAD MAN : “ That’s better! Usually yon want to talk
to me about a lot of things haven't got.”
“Oxmead”:. According to the cableman,
the Shah of Persia, who has been punting
on Paris racecourses for several years past,
was so upset at hearing that he had been
deposed, on top of a bad day at St. Cloud,
that he turned his face to the wall, in a
manner of speaking, and missed the steeple-
chase meeting at Auteuil on Sunday.
Furthermore it is mentioned that the de-
throned potentate is by way of degenerating
into a “homeless tramp” and hinted that his
chances of being able to get an absinthe on
the nod will be dubious for the future. Paris
was always a favorite resort for monarclis
who were in danger of losing their crowns or
had already parted with the same. I once
saw a hard-looking citizen there who had
been King Milan of Serbia, the same who
abdicated, after a stormy reign complicated
by incessant matrimonial troubles, in favor
of his son Alexander —the Obrenovitch
dynasty came to an end with the murder of
the latter in 1903. Milan didn’t look in the
least like an ex-sovereign, even a Balkan one,
and lie was probably happier putting five-
franc pieces into the pari-mutuel at Paris
than trying to be a king at Belgrade. Pos-
sibly one reason why France continues so
determinedly republican is that it has been
given the chance of seeing so many scallywag
ex-kings and claimants to crowns at close
range.
“P.X.”: I hope the Shah of Persia had his
teeth seen to before he was thrown out on
his poor little ear: worse wrecks I’ve rarely
seen in a human mouth. When I last in-
spected him he was climbing down the side
of a P. and O. boat that had brought us
both from Marseilles —he was taking a little
steamer from Bombay to the Persian Gulf.
The night before he had (more or less)
handed over the sports prizes. That was
the occasion when he discovered the superior-
ity of the French which the poor weakling
spoke pretty well over the English which
he never tried to speak at all'. The crowd,
as usual, sang “For he’s a jolly good fellow.”
After the first line his French secretary in-
terpreted it for him. The second line fol-
lowed, and, interpreted, that turned out to
be the same. When the third line was de-
clared to mean also exactly the same thing,
the poor little fellow smiled wanly, but,
asked afterwards what he thought of it all,
ventured the opinion that the English were
rather short of complimentary speeches.
“Ike” (Itabaul) : How’s this for the spread
of job-control? The Poonbar was due to
sail for Sydney on October 3, and on October
6 she’s still here. The native crew refused
to work the ship to Sydney, as they had
already seen that city plenty of times, but
if her destination was altered to Melbourne
(a place they hadn’t been to) they were will-
ing to return to duty. In the language of
Uncle Sam, Tom Walsh has nothing on this
crowd.

“A.J.F.” : Re marriages of prisoners (B.
10/9/’25), I remember such a happening
when I was on guard duty at Monte Video
hospital camp near Weymouth (Eng.). The
bridegroom was an A.W.L.-er from a boat
which had left a few days before. lie had
got a girl into trouble and had deserted to do
the fair thing by her, but had been picked up
by the M.P.’s and sent to Monte Video.
While he was still waiting trial two lance-
jacks brought an order from the C.O. author-
ising me to hand him over to them at 2 p.m.,
so that he could be marched down to the
Weymouth church. He returned at 6 p.m.,
still under escort, but a happy benedict. I
had a yarn with him after tea, and when he
assured me that he would have deserted from
every boat they put him on until he had
succeeded in marrying the girl, I took a
chance, sending word to the bride to come
up to the guard-room after 8 p.m., when the
orderly-officer would have done his round.
She did so, and the pair honeymooned in one
of the cells.

“Coppcrtop”; That Belgian boy wasn’t
the only waif smuggled
aboard an Australian-bound
troopship (B. 15/10/’25).
When the Euripides was
leaving Plymouth in Septem-
ber, 1919, a French lad, both
of whose parents had been
killed during the war, came
past the guards in a kitbag.
Certainly it was an outsize
bag, for the youngster was
15, though slim-built. The
day after we sailed he
appeared on deck in a full
Aussie rigout. All went well
till we reached Durban,
where the skipper dropped
to him. His benefactor gave
a signed guarantee that lie
would adopt the boy on his
arrival in South Aus. to take
the place of a younger
brother who had made the
great sacrifice. I have no
doubt the boy found a good
home, for his self-appointed
guardian was a station-
owner who had done his bit as a full-blown
private.

“Lao-dah” : Opium is plentiful in Sydney
at present. The other evening a natty little
Bengali who was trading contraband silk
socks and scarves to suburban housewives
offered me sufficient chandu to transport a
regiment to Sworga if I cared to accom-
pany him down to his ship. He spoke Malay,
which is the pidgin of the opium-smuggling
•business, and he operated on the China run.
The organisation is an international con-
cern with world-wide ramifications in which
Chinese secret societies co-operate with quite
respectable foreign firms. The old Chinese
seaman who got 12 months in Sydney for
being found with £15,000 Worth, and who
stated that he and his family would suffer
a worse fate when he got out, was probably
telling the gospel truth. Singapore is the
clearing-house, and few vessels leaving that
port are free of the treacly damnation. A
white passenger from Singapore was offered
a parcel of Macao No. 1 the other day by a
Malay matros as his ship drew into Circular
Quay. He hadn’t intended to be an opium-
smuggler when he woke up that morning,
but the packet looked so handy that he found
himself passing over £l5 and walking down
the gangway with the stuff in his coat
pocket. He got rid of it without trouble
for £95.
FELT THE HOOK.
“Phyllis said Arthur looked like
a fish out of water token he
proposed.”
“No wonder! The poor fellow knew he was caught.”
“X2X”: The Tasmanian patient who had
to be operated on for the removal of pins,
tacks and numerous similar articles, which he
had swallowed is no rarity in hospital prac-
tice. Not long ago a woman at one of our
metropolitan hospitals told the doctor that
she had a pain in her side. The diagnosis
being appendicitis, she was operated on,
whereupon it was discovered that the trouble
was a metal beer-bottle capsule in the intes-
tinal tract. The patient declared she had
no recollection of swallowing it, and could
offer no suggestion as to how it got there.
An 18-year-old Sydney youth, who was sus-
pected of peritonitis, was found to be really
suffering from an empty brass revolver cart-
ridge which in some inexplicable manner had
become lodged in his abdomen.
“Percy P.”: According to the Age report,
“the witness said he saw accused drinking
whisky in a hotel. Accused, however, saw
him, and disappeared” :
To catch him as he drained his glass
Was how I framed my plot;
But guessing at my scheme, alas,
He vanished from the “spot.”
“A.8.W.”: The antithesis of the murderer
who wanted to be hanged in a dress-suit (B.
29/10/’25) turned up at Pentonville Prison
(London) a few years ago in the form of a
condemned criminal who sought permission
to take the drop in the garb of Adam before
the Pall. Shocked officialdom inquired the
reason. “Well, it's like this,” replied the
doomed philosopher. “The chaplain says I’d
’ave to be born agin, and a cove cawn’t be
born wiv ’is cloves on.”
“Griffith Moses” : I am not sanguine, like
“Cable-crammer” (B. 5/11/’25) about the
boundless treasure, including a life-size
Virgin in pure gold, which the cable-dreamer
said was buried under the matted jungle in
the interior of Cocos Island. “C.-c.” holds
that the millions are certainly there unless
somebody has removed them. Probably—if
they were ever there. I don’t think treasures
of the anonymous sort ever are. Egyptian
royal tombs may pay an occasional dividend,
and there are authentic records of sunken
ships with money on board, but pirates are
poor assets. Faith in strangely preserved
treasure is wonderfully enduring. As a case
in point, Solomon is said to have left his
nest-egg in Jerusalem. It was spent over
and over again by his successors, also given
away as tribute. The city was captured 20
times or more, and searched for portable pro-
perty. It was destroyed various times, and
once the site of the temple was ploughed up
in quest of the widow’s mite. Yet in the
early part of this century two young Y'an-
kees and a native hireling got into the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre by night, and
dug or blasted a considerable hole in an
obscure corner. An enduring legend said
that Solomon’s pile was planted below and
at no great depth, and the treasure-hunters
took the matter seriously.

“Clement R. d’Uppe” : In a northern sea-
port two hotels have been dividing the beer-
money handed out to the shipping strikers by
levy-collecting ofti-
cials. One morning
Mr. Ticklebrain,
proprietor of the
Ship In n, was
handed a subscrip-
tion list by a
stoker, who pointed
out that Mr. Hogs-
head, proprietor of
the Seamen’s Arms,
had headed the list
with a donation of
£lO. There it was,
right at the top:
“Henry Hogshead,
£10.” Mr. Tickle-
brain wouldn’t sub-
scribe. His beer

“Ex-R.N.” : There has been an even more
recent addition to H.M.A.S. Adelaide’s
bridge than “the strange projection like an
inverted coffin” which houses her steering
compass (B. 22/10/’25). A couple of years
ago the people of Adelaide subscribed £lOOO
to fit up the cruiser with a complete set of
silver band-instruments. As there was no
band-room on board, and as space in a man-
o’-war is very restricted, they were stowed
in various odd corners —one of the oddest
being the captain’s private lavatory. The
incongruity of using such a room for such
a purpose seems to have struck somebody,
so the Navy Office was approaclied, and
after much argument permission was ob-
tained for Garden Island Dockyard to erect
a small compartment under the bridge super-
structure to house the instruments. This
was completed just before the Adelaide left
on her spring cruise, and the new band-
room can be seen underneath the bridge on
the port side.
ONE OF THE OLD-FASHIONED KIND.

work.”
“Oh, priceless! She’s so willing she’s offered
to help hubby with the dinner wash!”
“Morse”: They still breed them. At
Baldry (N.S.W.) the other day an infant
of eight years was bitten on the leg by a
snake. Ilis big brother made a tourniquet
of bootlaces, gashed the puncture in the
approved fashion, and applied permanganate
of potash. Then he telephoned for help. The
bitten one’s life was saved. Big brother has
just turned ten.

“Dean Inge has hurled a bombshell at Christian
opinion by declaring- that ‘the Church must give up
shuffling, and recast its familiar doctrines. The
whole idea of a geographical Heaven must be aban-
doned. There is serious conflict between religion and
science. We can hardly imagine an infinitely distant
star chosen as the site of the heavenly Jerusalem,
and the belief in a subterranean place of punishment
has faded away. We must think of Heaven as a
state rather than a place.’”— Cable.
O common-sensible ecclesiastic!
They picture you a blend of g-ibes and gloom;
But were your fellow-parsons half as drastic
At ; sweeping out with a relentless broom
Exploded dogmas and beliefs fantastic,
There’d be a trifle less of yawning room
In church and chapel; and, ’tis safe to state,
A trifle more in the collection plate.
Science and scripture aren’t in contradiction—
Such is the average cleric’s weekly bleat.
You scorn that parrot-cry, that piteous fiction,
Knowing they are at variance complete,
And in the glow of that matured conviction
You’ll be no party to the smug deceit,
The pious make-believe that black is white,
And day, in some mysterious fashion, night.
Farewell —a long farewell!—celestial Zion,
Located none could say exactly where.
Mayhap between the Scorpion and the Lion
Or ’twixt the Virgin and the Little Bear?
Above the Southern Cross? Below Orion?
Vale! I cannot say I greatly care.
I never felt my title very clear
To mansions in your firmamental sphere.
When shrewd astronomers were non-existent
You were a pleasantly essential clause
Of many a creed. But ’twas in ages distant
And now you have to be re-cast, because
You are so obviously inconsistent,
O New Jerusalem, with natural laws.
Off, with Olympus and Valhalla, please,
Into the limbo of anomalies!
You are no place with recognised position,
No airy Paradise where angels dwell,
But just an abstract state, a pure condition.
The same with y#u, Gehenna, Sheol, Hell!
Science insists upon your abolition
Viewed geographic’lly—though, truth to tell,
Most of us knew you were a state, - old thing,
Before this blast of common-sense from Inge.

Kip”: The Melbourne police are recover-
mg form. Recently they captured 53 men
in one swoop on a two-up school, and netted
well over £lOO in fines and costs. Almostimme-
diately followed the Cup, and Abraham and
Hennessy had their schools in the paddock
and on the hill; but no John Hop interfered.
The gamblers reached Flemington by Rolls-
Royce, drag, train, leg or Lizzie, and got
there without interference. That’s how it
stands when you delight in a horse’s legs,
A TESTIMONIAL.
“ Didn’t you go off pop when the cop swore you word doing sixty?”
"In my old ’bus? Not much — why, I could have kissed him!”
But if your choice in gambling turns on
the propulsion of a coin you arrive on the
scene quite otherwise. Into the two-up
palace where an admittedly fair game was
played the police penetrated only after chop-
ping through a fence and a hoarding. Why
all this distinction between two sets of
gamblers? It is a penal offence to bet a
florin on the tossing of a coin, but a virtu-
ous encouragement of the breeding of horses
to wager on the swiftness of a nag’s legs or
his luck in a run. Is the bedrock principle
of this differentiation to be found in logic,
ethics, religion, philosophy, the higher
mathematics or still higher Christian science
or where? Or is it all caprice or humbug?

“Longo”: Nowadays they just bump their
way through the Queensland railways. Re-
cently a driver found that his more than
usually decrepit engine was incapable of
hauling a mixed train up the Kinbombi
range, on the Kingarvy line. At a point
about halfway up the range the resting train
was overtaken by another, though there were
many hours between their scheduled times.
The newcomer quickly grasped the situation,
and with a better class of engine butted
gently on to the rear of the stationary
guard’s-van. By dint of the united effort of
the two engines, watched with interest by
the passengers of both trains, the remainder
of the range was negotiated. At the summit
the decrepit engine was allowed some
minutes’ start for the next stage of the
journey.

“Static”: A million or so Australian
juveniles had another illusion shattered the
other evening. The genial deity who dissemi-
nates bedtime stories from one of the big
broadcasting stations closed the session with
the usual admonition to his little angels, and
the last softly cad,enced “Good night” was
still trembling through the ether when this
hit the air: “Hoo! Pour us out a wliisky-
soda, Bill —m’ throat’s as dry as a haddick!”
* * * *
“Sloper”: The other day an old lady came
to me in distress. She was an applicant for
an old-age pension, and the officials required
some proof of her age. Coming to Australia
when a child, she had no documentary proof
of any kind. She believed she had been bap-
tised in some village church in the old land,
but as she didn’t know its name there could
be no help from that source. I suggested
that she should hunt up some old crony who
had known her for many years and get a
declaration from her. Off went the good soul
with the spark of hope in her to look up
the desired friend. A couple of days later
she returned in triumph with this precious
document: “Norah Mullheron, of domestic
duties, certifies to age of her first cousin.
Having known her from her infancy, I am
sure that she is 10 years older than I am.”
They both thought it quite conclusive.

“Hamer”: The Price of Wales helped two
Diggers in a Vic. country town to sell a
large stock of “bowler” hats of an old vin-
tage. The Diggers
took the headgear
over with the store
which they bought
after the war, and
although the goods
were not itemised
in the stock, and
were fair quality,
they were unmov-
able and a source
of annoyance. With
an idea in their
heads, the Diggers
sent one of the
hats to. the Prince
with a request that
he would accept it
in the spirit in
which it was
meant, or words to
that effect; and
they cheerfully
added that, although
they did not know
the size the Prince
wore, he might
make the lid fit, if
it was too large,
by putting blotting-
paper in the lining.
The hat came back,
but with it a letter
of thanks, in which
the Diggers were
humorously told
that, after trying
many strips of
blotting-paper, it
was found that
several sheets more
would have been
necessary to make
a fit. The hat,
shown on a gold-
braided velvet
cushion in a cleared
window, with the
Prince’s letter of
thanks and some
strips of blotting-
paper, created a sensation in the little ham-
let [ and the Diggers sold the entire stock.

“Feng-Shui”: I have more than once met
a massed attack of American tourists such
as will descend on these shores next month.
Once in Dabuan, a small island off the coast
of British Borneo. Inventory: One street
of Chinese shops, one gaol, one geisha-house,
one courthouse, one assistant-resident, one
district-officer who mixed good cocktails, one
doctor, one cable staff, one leper and 4000
natives of very mixed blood. Out of this
material wm made an entertainment, includ-
ing a Dyak war dance by local Ivadayan cow-
herds who had never seen a Dyak, and a
rhinoceros hunt, in which a domestic water-
buffalo, heard but only dimly seen, figured.
The s.s. Cleveland sailed away content, and
several books were written in which Savage
Borneo got prominence. On another occa-
sion I was brooding by evening light over
Boro Budur, the Hindu ruins in Central
Java, when a caterpillar of motor-cars dis-
charged 150 gloriously-groomed females and
raucous men over the stonescape. They
raced around the three miles of frescoes de-

picting Sakyamuni’s pathetic struggle for
Nirvana, and departed; and the 10,000
Buddhas on the topmost terrace slowly
dropped an eyelid. Australia is to be in-
spected in the same exhaustive manner. The
Carinthia (20,000 tons) is to remain in
Sydney 36 hours and in Melbourne probably
the same. There will be 400 investigators
(passage rates up to £l6OO a head) and one
in 10, on previous averages, will write a
book about it. I met one lady who makes
a habit of these tours. She just steps from
the gangway of one floating residential on
to another in N’York harbor.
“Sixenate”: The Melbourne magistrate
who was responsible for this one has a name
which is not markedly Irish. He had been
irritated by the contradictions in the evi-
dence. and interrupted the solicitor of one
of the parties testily. “If what the
plaintiff and the defendant say is true,” he
declared, “then one of them must be lying.”
* * * *
“Uramao”: Auckland’s e'seaped leopard
was found drowned in the harbor, but not
before it had got well on to the nerves of
the suburbs. It even invaded political meet-
ings and got into candidates’ perorations.
One man solemnly said: “I warn you against
putting into power a party that will leopard-
isc your jiberty.”
* * * *
“Ces”: Among the latest malcontents to
adopt the strike weapon are 300 school kid-
dies at Altona, near Williamstown (Vic.) ;
their grievanco against authority was an in-
sufficiency of drinking fluid, caused by low
pressure and small water-mains. A hot spell
in Melbourne led to a rush on the product
of the tap, and the unsatisfied kids finally
tackled the only tank on the premises, hold-
ing up the school lessons for over an hour
while they satisfied their thirst. The next
morning when the headmaster turned up
there were only three out 300 nippers in the
playground, and they didn t stay there long,
Nothing could be done but declare school off
for the day. The Education Department has
a shrewd suspicion that the strike was organ-
ised by the mums and dads of the district,
who, the night before, had an indignation
meeting on the water question.

dirty
Paul Puffin Whom I barely knew by sight
(He is seeking re-election), greeted me with warm
affection
And absorbed my sage opinions with delight.
With a deference disarming which I could not find
but charming,
Lest he miss my slightest word he bent his head ;
Then he shook my hand with vigor. But the wood-
pile showed its nigger
When “I trust that I may count on you,” he said,
As I trod the pavement gritty during lunch-hour in
the city
A man I’d met but once accosted me
With a spaniel-like devotion that gave credence to
the notion
That he must have thought that I was Edward P.
He held my hand in tether while he spoke of crops
and weather,
And then I saw his keen eye blink and shift;
“You’ll pardon this detention but I thought no
harm to mention
“I’ve a car for sale—-believe me, it’s a gift.”

“Cue” : However the elections may go, the
campaign has shown Stanley Bruce to be as
strenuous, as indefatigable, as determined
and as clean a fighter as ever led a party.
There have been leaders before who strained
every nerve for victory and never spared
themselves (like Hughes), and there have
been others who disdained personalities and
kept clear of rancor (like Deakin), and
there have been invincibly good-tempered
ones in the face of any sort of hostility
(like ,Reid), but Bruce has gone nearer to
combining all these attributes than any one
of his predecessors. His restraint in diction
at one of the stormiest periods of Austra-
lian political history has been as marked
as his whirlwind vigor in campaigning. He
lias eschewed all personal attacks, and even
when he has had to rebut such as have been
unworthily levelled against himself it has
been with a temperatencss which served to
bring into clearer relief the reckless in-
temperance of opponents. The man who
never permits himself to lose his temper is
rare in politics. The only occasion on which
Bruce is remembered as having permitted
himself the luxury is when he was defend-
ing, not himself, but a fellow-officer of his
in the war against some of the vilest
charges and insinuations to which a soldier
can be subjected. And nobody will ever
blame him for that.
Passed out in Melbourne the other day,
aged 83, Patrick Hannan, the recognised dis-
coverer, nearly 33 years ago, of what was
destined to prove Australia’s greatest gold-
field, Kalgoorlie. That is, it was he who
received the Government reward for locat-
ing gold there, although the usual contro-
versy arose afterwards, and recurred at in-
tervals for years, as to whether there were
not two or three others with claims as good
or better; similar discussions were waged
with great vigor on almost every W.A. field,
and there were never any means of settling
them. Hannan didn’t get much out of his
find except the Government douceur and the
distinction of leaving his name on Ival-
goorlie’s main street; the municipality
allotted him a tOAvn block a few, years later,
but it wasn’t in a central position. He was
Irish, like so many of the prospectors of
those days, especially those who left their
names on the map, and looked more like a
quiet and decorous family butler (old style)
than the venturous pioneer who, in the
graphic language of an orator of the period,
“went out into the trackless desert taking
his life in one hand, his waterbag in an-
other and his pick in a third.”
Lancelot Stirling, 76 on November 5, has
teen president of S. Aus. Leg. Council since
July, 1901, thus holding the Australian re-
cord for presidency of an elective Chamber.
Henry Parkes’s aggregate Parliamentary
service exceeded 40 years, but the “father”
of the S. Aus. Parliament beats that.
A lot of people will regret that Ellen
Melville, of Auckland, the only woman can-
didate at the recent M.L. poll, did not at
this her third attempt manage to get there.
Pluckily tackling perhaps the strongest
Labor centre in M.L., she made a surprisingly
good showing. Interruption at her meetings
was solidly organised, but Miss Melville, who
is a solicitor and a city councillor, showed
herself quite capable of handling an unruly
opposition.
With Commander Frank Worsley, D. 5.0.,
R.N.R., of Maoriland, leadership is a habit.
In his 53 years he has been captain of the
Endurance in Shackleton’s South Polar
ramble, navigator of Shackleton’s whale-
boat from Elephant Island to South
Georgia, skipper of two mystery-ships, a
gunboat and a monitor in the Great War,
and pilot of the Quest in 1921. Now Algars-
sen’s North Polar expedition lobs back at
Tromso, Norway, with Worsley instead of
Algarsson on the bridge. That he stayed
below singing comic songs while his ship
fought a gale for 40 hours, and claimed to
be heir to the throne of Iceland ; were some
of the quaint plaints brought against the
Scandinavian, who was stated to have been
deposed by his indignant party, the Maori-
lander being elected in his stead.
Wellington (M.L.) lost its biggest glad-
rag man when John Ivirkcaldie, a hard-
headed Scot frae Fifesliire. died the other

abandoned his drawing-board, what he has
done has been for his own beguilement.
Lately, however, he has been persuaded to
pass over one or two things. One, “A

“Hop” humor, arid not a bit the sort of
carol you’ll see illustrated in English papers
—will be a feature of the special Christmas
number to be published on December 12.
De Pinedo, the Italian flier, who, through
getting back to Rome before Armistice Day,
will share fifty-fifty with his mechanic Cam-
panelli in the 100,000 lire (£1000) offered
by Cavalier Giovanni Ferrando, of Mel-
bourne, had some things to say about Aus-
tralia when he reached Shanghai on his
homeward way. He remarked that the most
difficult and dangerous portion of the jour-
ney was round the coast of this continent,
with its lack of harbors. He evidently got
Lis directions from some politician who
hadn’t heard of Denham Sound, Port Lin-
coln, Twofold Bay, Port Stephens and the
rest.
S. Aus. Minister A. A. Kirkpatrick, who
is nearing his 78th birthday, led Adelaide’s
Upper House last week in the absence of
Chief Secretary Jelley. The new role re-
minded members of his briskness and skill
as leader of the same Chamber a quarter of
a century ago, before he went to the Cold
Country as Agent-General. Kirkpatrick was
elected to Parliament in 1891 as oTie of the
first direct Labor reps.
From submarine-cabling at the now de-
funct Eastern Extension Co.’s station at La
I’erouse (Sydney) to submarine chasing
with the R.A.N. in the North Sea is the
record of Rev. F. C. Birch, who is getting-
out his shore suit on the Sydney to step
into the pulpit of St. Paul’s, Ipswich (Q.).
A genial and popular bachelor padre, he
began liis sea service with H.M.A.S. Aus-
tralia, sky-piloted the training-ship Tingira
at her moorings in Sydney, and had a look
at Singapore on board the Emden’s nemesis
the other day.
A plucky veteran of 73 is A. Dungey, a
formeri superintendent of police. Whilst out
working on his farm at Phillip Island (Vic.)
he broke his leg. Crawling to some timber
he made rough splints. He lay on the ground
for 10 days, drinking sips of rainwater
caught in his hat, until his leg was well
enough to drag him to his bouse. Finding
the limb knitting badly, he broke and reset
it, and was just able to hobble with an
improvised crutch when the heavy thing fell
on one of his toes and broke it. After that
he decided outside help was needed. He
painfully attached a flag to a pole against
the side of the house, and eventually
attracted notice: but it was 23 days from
the first leg-fracture before he was landed
in a Melbourne hospital.
The Queensland Rhodes scholar for 1925
is N. N. L. Harrison, of All Souls’ C. of E.

a solid Arts student; but the outstanding
feature of his career was a 440 yards in 50
2-5 sec., which clipped a fraction off Nigel
Barker’s record of 1905.

tain James S. M. Ritchie is a Dunedin lad,
and was educated there and at Wanganui
College. He entered the R.N. in 1899, was
a midshipmite on the Australian station
from 1901 to 1903, and for the rest has
served in British, Mediterranean and China
waters. During the war he looked after the
shooting of the St. Vincent and Iron Duke.
The Melbourne Cup's most ancient spec-
tator among the members of the present
V.R.O. committee is Henry Gamble, who
began the habit in The Barb’s year. That
was 69 years ago (it was the sixth Cup),
and he hasn’t mis.sed since, although before
lie settled in Melbourne he had to tackle
the rough passage every year from Tasmania.
He was a liandicapper and steward in the
Apple Island, and later, when he established
a chemist's business in Bourke-street, be-
came a member of the V.R.C. His own
Paddy’s Land, with a splinter in its shoulder
from a collision with the fence, carried his
• dors into fourth place in one Cup; and
in the old unrestricted days he organised
many sweeps over the big event. Another
oldster present this year was E. J. Law-
rence, now sec. and liandicapper to the Red-
eon Park R.C., Brisbane. He started
younger than Gamble, and, although only
70, has seen 55 Cups run.
"Bill R.”; Russel McMillan, the son of a
N.S.W. South Coast sawmiller, went to the
little one-lady-teaclier school at Corunna, and
there won the bursary that gave him en-
trance to a city High School. The promise
he showed at the High School determined
his father that the boy should have a Uni-
versity training whatever sacrifice it in-
volved on his part. At the Uni. Russel
won the Ben Fuller travelling scholarship,

Robert Grierson (Town Clerk), Arthur

James McGowen started campaigning 35

A still, starry night at Canberra. Two
figures steal out of the Government hostel.
One carries what looks like an infernal-
machine and a coil of wire; the other a
bicycle-pump and a magician's wand. They
deploy on the lawn, in the direction of a
water-tap. One fixes the pump to a length
of hose while the other connects his infernal
machine to a piece of gaspipe. The thin
one pumps while the thick one apparently
writes his impressions of the scenery in a
notebook. Then they rub the magician’s
wand with a silk handkerchief, and make
passes in the air, conversing meanwhile in
sinister murmurs. Finally they clear up all
traces of their operations and sneak indoors
again. The two conspirators are the many-
lettered W. B. Rimmer. from the Norman
Lockyer Observatory in England, and A. L.

“Taiaha” : A recent Bulletin par. raised
tin 1 question of language difficulties in inter-
national radio, and “Ida D.” mentioned a
conversation in English between a Buenos
Aires amateur and a Maoriland ditto. The
Maorilander, whose station was placed in
Poverty Bay, might have been either I. J.
O'Meara or It. J. Patty, to either of whom
a conversation with the Argentine is a mere
chat over the back fence. Together and sepa-
rately they have established two-way radio
communication with every European coun-
try except Russia and Norway; also with
Algeria, India, Indo-Cliina, the United
States, Canada and many of the South
American republics. The outstanding
achievement to date is hooking on to SMYY,
a Swedish station, and exchanging views on
radio with the proprietor of that plant.
Their feats have gained recognition in the
States, and at the conclusion of a recent
broadcast test from Pittsburgh, special men-
tion was made of one of them. They have
both assured the writer that language diffi-
culties do not trouble them, for all the lead-
ing foreign amateurs have some command of
English, which bids fair to become the uni-
versal medium of radio communication.
Presbyterian minister Tom Tait, M.A.,
etc., who a couple of years ago somewhat
dramatically resigned the pastorate of Scots’
Church, Sydney, and practically recom-
mended the Assembly to close the old kirk,
has fared better in Canada. He is drawing
£lOOO a year as pastor of the First Church
at Edmonton, Alberta, where the communi-
cants number 800. Though an eloquent and
scholarly preacher, Tait failed to draw a
congregation in Dr. Lang’s old tabernacle;
lie seldom had more than 80 hearers. No
kirk in N. S. Wales pays £lOOO in salary;
few more than half of it. St. Stephen’s
(Sydney) paid the late John Ferguson £9OO,
which was probably doubled by marriage
and other fees.
After drawing a pension of £4O Bs. 6d. for
nearly 30 years, Annie Watts, an ex-teacher
of the Vic. Education Department, has de-
cided to relinquish it, but has assigned no
reason. She was a teacher at Rowsley and
Bacchus Marsh for 16 years, and retired
owing to ill health. It is questionable,
though, whether she can sign away her rights.
There are at least two instances of other
women teachers taking similar action, though
less formally; but they afterwards resumed
the drawing of superannuation. In another
case the lady desired her pension stopped
because she had married a man who had
developed strong antagonism to work, and
she thought a life of idleness would be bad
for him.
THE POLITICAL BIRD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He sat on the fence, a ragged crow,
Oh an ancient crow was he;
And the voice that he used was a voice of woe,
As he thoughtfully pecked at his biggest toe,
And he cawed and cawed at me.
He groaned and he grunted, that ugly bird,
An unseemly melody;
With a ponderousness that was quite absurd
He delivered himself, as I stood and heard,
Of a raucous cawserie.
And I wondered, “Now, why do you caw and call
Since you hold no song in fee?
And why do you sit on the fence at all?
AVith your horrible habits and coat like a pall,
You should hide yourself in a tree.’’
But he winked at me once and he winked again
(Quite obscene was the sight to see)
And he said in a sort of a sad refrain:
“AA r hy, I sit on the fence for the reason plain
That to hop each way I am free.
“And I prink and I preen, though it seem to you
A dull futility.
I am drab and indecent, you say, but —phew !
I can tell you I know a bird or two
That are worse, far worse, than me.
“And if I’d my way you’d be forced to hear
And admire my minstrelsy ;
It ought to be law and the reason’s clear —
These afore mentioned fellows, that live quite near,
Can’t sing at all,” said he.
In the logic of that quaint fowl there seemed
A familiarity;
And then, as enlightenment on me streamed,
And I thought otf elections —“Of course,” 1 screamed,
“Why, you’re old Jim Crow, M.P.”

BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Morob” : A plausible explanation of the
fire-walking ceremonies in the Pacific (B. 15/10/’25)
has been suggested by some American and English
scientists who spent nearly a year on one of the
islands of the Fiji group where the ritual is carried
out. It is to the effect that the stones on which
the walking is done are flat slabs of basalt, of a
variety distinguished by impermeability to heat.
The fire is first built and another kind of stone laid
on top of it, the basaltic slabs being then placed on
the upper surface. After some hours the stones
underneath become red-hot, and so does that part of
the basalt in immediate contact with them. Seen
through the slabs this gives the whole the appearance
of being red hot. Of course there is some heat in the
stones touched by the feet of the fire-walkers, but
the toughness and thickness of their soles, together
with a good deal of practice, enables them to go
through the ceremony easily, though there is suffi-
cient heat to deter white men from trying the
experiment.
* * * *
. “Te Bab”: Here is another wager with
a catch in it. A five-foot-and-some chap bet Bob
Cannon, who measures very little short of 7ft., that,
standing upright, Bob couldn’t reach as far as he.
Bob looked at the wee fellow, grinned, and took
him. The umpire and the audience, who were in
the know, conducted Bob to a chimney-place in a
cottage under erection and introduced him to the
arch of the fireplace. Standing upright with his
back to the wall, the small chap, reaching down,
comfortably gripped the bricks. Bob tried and
failed—his stature was too great for his down-
hanging hands to touch the arch without bending
his knees, and that was barred.
* * * *
“Canar”: The highly rarefied air of the
upper regions of New Guinea plays strange tricks
with the human voice. Once two members of our
party in the mountains at the back of the Eitape
district wandered from camp. Shortly afterwards
they could be distinctly heard talking to each other.
Although more than a mile away every syllable was
as clear as if the speakers were at hand. Another
time in the same district one man hailed the others
a quarter of a mile distant. A gorge thousands of
feet deep separated them, and as the voice came
across this abyss it was punctuated with “er-er-ers”
like the speech of an uncertain orator, although
every word was clear. Another* trick the thin atmo-
sphere often plays is to make a shout seem to
come from the quarter exactly opposite its true origin.
“Moe”: In the Kaiserin xlugusta Moun-
tains in New Guinea there lives a race of natives
the bodies of whose men are covered with a thick
black furry sort of hair, not unlike that one sees on
monkeys. This hair extends practically from the
ankles, being thickest on the legs and arms, up to
the neck, and is very long on the chest and shoulders.
It is an excellent protection against the night cold
of the ranges, although sometimes garments of skins
are added. The natives are extremely primitive,
with a meagre vocabulary, eked out by a kind of
grunting noise, and some of their customs are
hideous.
* » * *
“Ento”: It is only the male of Hecatesia
fenestrata (B. 8/'lO/’25) that whistles when the sun
is sinking; the female moth flying silently in the
broad daylight is rarely seen. The
sound is duplex: first, the weaker
whistle proper ; second, a clicking
which may or may not accompany
it, but nevertheless is the noise
that first attracts the passer-by.
The latter sound is produced at
will, but the former is due entirely
to the position and shape of the
anterior edge of the front wing
when beating the air during a
dance. Presumably somewhere in
the vicinity is a female, but I have
never found one under these con-
ditions. Another species, the rare
11. erulans, occurs in the vicinity
of Perth, and I found only one
during 18 months’ residence there;
this was a male flying noiselessly
in the morning. “Slam’s” theory
of the antenns operating for the
purpose of producing the sound in
Hecatesia is new to me. The only
artificial click I could produce on
a living specimen was by bringing
together suddenly over the crea-
ture’s back the hard inverted bowl-
like lobes of the wing. I therefore
suggest that the so-called whistle
is produced mainly by the clapping
together of these castanets.
“Abe” (RabaulJ : The following is a copy
of a communication I received from my boss boy the
other morning: “8 oklok log Mornig taem. Astede
log tri oklok 0 palaboi i sidaun natig na oli kaikai
bilinat. Naen blong im Abolos, Makele, Kai, Sari,
Amen, Aogn.” This is the translation; “8 o’clock
along morning time. Yesterday along three o’clock
0 fellow-boy he sit down nothing, now all of them
eat betel-nut. Names belong them, Abolos, Makele,
Kai, Sari, Amen, Aogn.” The trouble was that six
of his gang who had been detailed to cut grass
were found by him to be having a quite laze, chew-
ing betel-nut. Although the names of the boys are
not spelt correctly, they all answered to my phonetic
pronunciation when I went out to investigate.
* * * *
“Tamornie”: A New Guinea native suf-
fering from headache ties a cord tightly round his
head or has a series of small incisions made on the
forehead. The leaves of an aromatic plant growing
in the Hansa Bay district is used there for the same
purpose, either by crushing the leaves in the hands
and inhaling the aroma or by steeping them in hot
water and drinking the tea. I have tried this with
success myself. Carriers suffering from cramp after
a long march pluck the leaves/ of a stinging plant
and beat the affected muscle with them. They claim
that this relieves the pain and enables them to con-
tinue walking. I used these leaves in what seemed
to me a case of apoplexy. I applied them to the
inner thighs and inner portion of the upper arm, and
shortly afterwards the patient became normal, and
the congested veins in the head and neck relaxed.
The patient himself was not blistered, but where the
leaves had touched my own arms scores of tiny
blisters formed and caused me discomfort for over
an hour.
“W.Y.N.”; Re axe-handles (B. 8/10/’25).
Many years ago a man named Emmerton started a
factory on the North-West Coast of Tasmania, and
HE'D PROVE IT.
“Never forget, my poah man, that he who tries to drown his
troubles comes to no good.”
“My oath, don't I know it, mister! I pushed me mother-in-law
off a wharf.”
turned Out hundreds of axe- and pick-handles from
native woods. Leatherwood proved the most satis-
factory ; while not so heavy and compact as hick-
ory, it is tough enough for the purpose. This tree
runs only about Bin. to one foot in diameter, and
grows up to 50ft. high. The only other wood seri-
ously tried for axe-handles was the horizontal. Its
defect is that it is too supple and springy, though
excellent for hammer and tomahawk handles and
such like. I have used it for maul and fernhook-
handles in the old days; it is almost unbreakable,
and after it is split and shattered will hang to the
last thread. The tree is looked, upon as a curse by
prospectors, but is undoubtedly a valuable timber,
and there would be no difficulty about reafforesta-
tion, as it springs up again very quickly. Emmer-
ton, like many other pioneers, was beaten by want
of capital.
* * * *
“Nitric”: “Din” wants to know (B.
15/10/’25) why liis ironbark firewood, struck by
lightning, was no good for burning purposes. It i;
due primarily to the great temperature set up by
the lightning flash, which caused the sudden evapora
tion of the liquid contents of the tree. Lightning
either strips the trees partially or wholly of theii
bark or splits their wood into thin lathes or a mass
of fibres, subjecting it to a sudden heating effect.
' which deprives it of the hydrocarbon and mineral
contents that give the burning value.
* * * »
“Mephisto”: Virgil (70-19 b.c.) knew ;
lot about black sheep and gave the following advice
to breeders: —
Is wool thy care? Let not thy cattle go
Where bushes are, where burrs and thistles grow,
Nor in too rank a pasture let them feed.
Then of the purest • White select thy breed.
E’en though a snowy ram thou shqlt behold,
Prefer him not in haste for husband of thy fold;
But search his mouth ; and if a swarthy tongue
Is underneath his humid palate hung,
Reject him, lest he darken all thy flock,
And substitute another from thy stock.
Cotumilla wrote: “These wools are of divers colors.
Pollentia in Italy produces grey and black, and
Corduba in Spain a wool of reddish color.” But
perhaps that writer had not seen the merino in
its scoured state.
* * * *
“F.S.” : “Black as a crow” is not always
a true saying. F. Slee, of Canmain (N.S.W.), re-
cently captured two young crows, both white as a
dove. One died, but the other is thriving.
-* * * *
“Ade L.”: In many parts of the Far North
are forests of a bloodwood which in autumn of every
third year bloom in profusion. Their honey-laden,
white-pink flowers are food for countless thousands
of gorgeous parrots. Later, in August and September,
when clusters of cup-shaped seeds hang from every
limb, it is unsafe to venture far into these forests.
On windy days the hard-shelled seeds rain down
from the tall trees. During my 12 .years of wander-
ing in the North I have frequently been caught and
battered. Once, taking advantage of a calm morning,
I rode in search of scientific specimens far into a
heavily-timbered valley. Later in the day a strong
breeze rose before I could reach one of the border-
ing hills, and my horse, maddened by the constant
falling of seeds, broke away and raced to his death
at the bottom of a ravine. Late in the night I
reached camp sore-footed and badly hammered.
“Mephisto”: “Cartot” (B. l/10/’25) is a
little off the track when he speaks of meteorites being
hot enough, and consequently soft enough, to change
their shape on striking our atmosphere. He says
that “when they leave their original starting point
they are molten.” True,
but most of them
started off thousands
or it may be millions
of years ago to career
in absolute space.
Here their temperature
would be reduced to
somewhere about
273 deg. C., which is
rather cold. As soon
as they begin to tear
through out atmo-
sphere they are warmed
up by the friction of
their passage. Then
they burn and some-
one says: “Look ; a
snooting star!” Nearly
always they burn out
before reaching the
earth, but occasionally
a large missile strikes
it. Meteorites begin
to glow in our atmo-
sphere at a distance
of 70 or 80 miles out,
and, travelling as they
do at from 20 to 30
miles per second, burn
out when about 20
miles from the surface.
It is estimated that
about a hundred mil-
lion meteorites are cre-
mated in our atmo-
sphere every day. Space
is full of them. A
comet is composed of
them, its nucleus con-
sisting of a swarm,
sometimes thousands of
miles wide, of these
pieces of iron or stone.
From outer . space this
group moves into our system and is forced to
travel round the sun, moving ever faster and faster,
the tail being formed by the heating-up of tiny
particles through mutual friction.
* * * *
“D.E.” : How does cocky gauge the weight
of his haystacks (B. l/10/’25)? The average
farmer knows nothing whatever about cubic feet of
hay; lie leaves that to insurance agents and hay-
buyers, who are usually wrong in their calculations.
He knows the weight of his stacks by experience,
and can judge his own to a few hundredweight, but
not the weight of others. The reason for this is
that no two paddocks will produce the same quality
of hay. Weight also depends largely on the time the
hay is cut and how well it is saved. Most success-
ful farmers build their own stacks, and are able to
tell by the number of loads the weight of their
contents.
OFTEN ARM IN ARM.
“Did you say your husband useter be a police-
man, Airs. Buds?”
“Well, no, not exactly a policeman. But ’e
useter go with 'em a lot.”
“Verri”: N. S. Wales preserves at the
public expense one monument to an animal (B.
24/9/’25). In the grounds of Vaucluse there is a
small tablet, under a great tree on the lawn, bearing
the name “Venn.” After chasing through the shil-
ling guidebook to the house where the first Austra-
lian Constitution was thought out, and finding no
mention of Venn, 1 looked up the caretaker and
learned that the little slab perpetuates the memory
of a favorite dog of Wentworth’s.

THE FAR HOMESTEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Long seasons since, a-crave for rest
And free untainted air,
1 sought a homestead in the West,
And found Peace dwelling there.
It stood beside a wheel-worn road;
And, warm of heart and hand,
Good folk, fine folk within it bode—
None kinder in the land.
In all the countryside, ’twas said,
None owned a warmer hearth;
Who came there found a table spread,
Talk, song and wholesome mirth."
And, better still than bite or sup,
And warmer than fire-glow,
A hearty word to cheer them up
If care were theirs—or woe.
On track and road, of broken men,
Tired men, men lined of brow,
God knows there were a-plenty then,
As there are plenty now!
To that far homestead in the West,
Behind its picket fence
And shaven lawn, there came no guest
Who did not journey thence
With hope uplifted, eyes that glowed,
And heart and will new-wrought
To tread life’s road, where’er that road
Should lead him, fearing nought.
There winter, summer, week by week,
Tired horsemen drew their reins—
Brown drovers down from Cooper’s Creek,
And drovers from the plains.
And there beneath soft pepper-trees
With leafage green and still
They sat and smoked their pipes at ease,
And laughed and talked their fill.
Old Hospitality their lord,
They watched the night-hours pass
With song and jest about the board,
And chink of glass on glass.
MORE OSTENTATION.
“They tell me a lot of them toffs wears silk undies
nowadays.”
“Good Lor'! What some people will do for show!”
Though north you strike, or east you strike,
Or south you take your way.
I vow that western homestead’s like
You will not find to-day.
Things are not now as they were then,
For hearts have harder grown,
And greed has gripped the souls of men,
And Self is lord alone.
Goodfellowship and fireside mirth
Are near to death, I ween;
For open door and glowing hearth,
Alas, are seldom seen !.
Above my head tobacco smoke
Slow wreathing rises white;
To that far homestead and its folk
I drink red wine to-night.

other country could produce quite as well. The
Ales of Burton -on - Trent, for instance, are
internationally renowned. Dublin Stout is inimitable
and so it goes on. To Holland is due the credit of
distilling the world famous Schnapps. So
distinctive in character is this particular beverage
that nowhere outside the little town of Schiedam,
not even in other parts of Holland , can
Schnapps be distilled.
There is one, and one only genuine Schiedam Schnapps-

“Trevdee”: There’s nothing on earth to
beat the common sheep-dog for faithfulness. At
Newmarket yards (Vic.) a drover left his coat hang-
ing over one of the fences and ordered his dog to
mind it. Like many another drover before him, he
went on a spree and didn’t sober up for two and
a half hot days afterwards. The first thing he did
was to rush to the yards, and i there he found his
dog, hot, hungry and thirsty, but still standing watch
over the coat. Most sheep-dogs would do the same.
* * * #
“Slam” : I’ve got two skins of male musk-
ducks which still scent the wash-house where they
have been kept for two years. Bushmen believe that
THE STICKLER.
“Now, tha’ settles it. I'll never gerr’ome
to-night.”
the seat of the strong, musky odor is the curious
semi-circular black pouch on the throat, and no dog
can be got to bring a shot musk-duck to land. The
real source of the pong is an oil-gland at the tail-end.
These ducks stay under water fully a minute, fossick-
ing in the mud for food, and often get caught and
drowned in the nets of Queensland river fishermen.
“Atherton”: The tern season is one of
plenty for the nomads of the Barrier islands on
which the birds lay their eggs among the broken
corals. They build no nests nor make the slightest
attempt to hide their masterpieces. The shell is grey
and brown with a camouflage of colors and queer
patterns. The eggs thus merge into the grey-white
flakes of broken coral, shells, driftwood, leaves and
tide-stranded seaweed. A man could look on a
thousand eggs and not see one. The young birds
also are quite invisible. I’ve stared at a clump of
the fluffy little balls and failed to see a bird in it
until a dislodged lump of coral made one move.
They’re dressed in a comical down-suit which blends
perfectly with the coral fragments. The little beg-
gars will not move even when a man picks them up.
They are utterly helpless and unprotected against
the ravaging hawk, but nature has camouflaged them
so well that as long as they don’t move they are
safe.
“Up North”: There’s an artist in nearly
every Cape York Peninsula tribe who collects much
“trade” by fashioning head and arm bands. These
are made of plaited lawyer-cane fibres, colored grasses
and animal or human hair. Pieces of cane are
split into very thin swathes and
plaited, the plaits being neatly
interspersed with strands of hair.
The band may be from half an
inch to two inches broad. A
skilled artist makes the ornament
a delight of brilliant colors by
glueing to it the crimson, blue
and green feathers of the parrot,
the pink of the galah and the vivid
yellow of the cocktaoo’s topknot.
Pendants of human hair-string
droop from the band, having on
their ends a tassel of crimson an 1
black berries. Less ambitious
forms are of plaited reeds softened
with dugong oil and ornamented
with zags of colored ochres. Occa-
sionally these have pendants end-
ing in a knob of colored grass-
tree resin in which are embedded
the polished teeth of dingoes or
kangaroos.
“Kriz”: “Broome” (B.
17/9/’25) is right—sea snakes
cannot travel on land. When left
high and dry by the tide even
as little as a yard from water, I
have seen them whirling i‘ound in
the mud, unable to get back. They
are very slow in the sea, and it
is easy to grab one from a lugger
and throw it on deck. But there
are more than two distinct varie-
ties on the Nor’-Westralian coast;
there are 12. The most common
is the yellow-bellied, which is
usually less than 3 ft. long and
is strikingly colored, being black
or dark brown above and bright
yellow beneath. Among the 12
varieties may be found the Port
Darwin, King’s long-necked, the
Elegant long-necked, Hardwick’s
and the Brown sea-snake. The
Port Darwin is only 18in. long,
but the others range from four to
eight feet. All are strictly marine.
“Ivoolamarra”: Re “C.P.’s” inquiry (B.
15/10/’25). In these days of big tallies, 240 sheep
per day of eight working hours is not at all un-
common. Any man putting up such a record must
shear each sheep in less than two minutes, as
besides doing the actual barbering he has to catch
his sheep, pull his machine in and out of gear, put
the shorn sheep down the shoot and change his
comb and cutter once or even twice in a run.
Regarding the second query—as to which holds the
day record, blades or machine—l am not in a
position to make a definite statement. Of one thing,
however, I am sure —far higher average tallies are
made with the machine than we used to make in
blade days. The fastest shearing 1 ever person-
ally witnessed was at Biddenham (W.Q.), in 1910,
when John Bunyan shore 60 full-woolled ewe hoggets
in 1 hour and 14 minutes. They were good cutting,
being small-framed, in good condition, very clean
and without wrinkles.
“Curlew”: In 1892 on several occasions I timed a
hand shearer named Jim Callaghan and from
the time he caught his first sheep in the morning
until he turned it, fairly well shorn, down the
shoot, it was 60 seconds. The sheep were full-
fleeced wethers. With the machine I have seen
men shearing 240 inside an eight-hour day. This
gives an average of one in two minutes, but some
individual sheep are shorn in much less. Northamp-
ton Downs in or about 1892 averaged nearly 200
a man for a large board of shearers. This was about
a sheep in 2i minutes for the entire clip. Lans-
downe ran them very close the same year. The
highest tallies I have witnessed in a legitimate
day’s shearing (Bhr. 35min., old style, to make
48hr. in 5J days) were 230 by hand shears and
253 by machines. Maloney did the 230 in 1892 and
Harry Livingstone the 253 about 1903. I have
heard of 320 with machines, but do not vouch for
it, nor do I know whether the sheep had much wool
to remove. Any fast shearer when on the job
can turn out one sheep under two minutes.
“C.0.M.P.”: Two minutes is not the record time
for shearing a full-woolled sheep. At Quantam-
bone station, near Brewarrina (N.S.W.), in 1924,
Edgar Spinks, of Coyvra, shore three full-woolled
merino ewes and caught the fourth in six minutes.
At Yanda station, near Bourke, this year, Angus
Flannery, of Harden, shore a merino ewe in under
two minutes. These are authentic records. Jack
Murphy, of Young, is credited by reputable men with
having shorn five sheep and caught the sixth in
seven minutes; but I cannot give details of the
class of sheep, which is a very important factor.
“E.S.S.”: At Fowler’s Bay, in 1874, “Long”
Maloney shore 11 big wethers in 11 minutes, using
a pair of Ward and Payne’s 38’s. That is the
best sprint I know of, though one a minute was
common in the old days among lambs. The first
to do it was Sid Ross, who shore nine lambs in nine
minutes at Belalie, Warrego River, in ISS4. Jimmy
Power was the champion machine shearer of his
day. At Barenya (Q.), on September 21, 1895, he
made his record of 315 mixed sheep in eight hours.
The best hand tally is Jack Howe’s 321 in eight
hours, made at Alice Downs in 1892. llowe’s time
has often been disputed, because the day’s run
was Bhr. 40min. But the other men on the board
were at work before Howe started, and he was back
in the hut before they left off. Dan Cooper, in 1910.
at Bundoran, Lower Flinders, beat Power’s tally by
one sheep ; and he is credited with shearing five
THE LAST ROLL-CALL.
OLE IKE (sinking fast) : “Ish Becky here?”
BECKY : “Yes, father, here I am, dear.”
OLE IKE: “Issy here, too?”
ISSY : “Yeth, Dad.”
OLE IKE: “Solly, too?”
SOLLY : “Yeth, ve are all here, poor fader.”
OLE IKE: “Den who ish lookin' after der shop?”
sheep in five minutes. He certainly shore one full-
sized, full-fleeced sheep in lmin. 38-|sec. Sheep on
the average are bigger and carry much heavier
fleeces now than was the case a quarter of a
century back.
* * * #
“.Tim Carew”: Is there anything in the
yarn that if a bull is continuously worked alongside
a bullock the latter loses condition and dies? Many
drivers firmly in it, and, if they have a bull
in the team, change his off-sider every couple of
days.
“Westclox”: I saw a Gilbert Islander
catch a 221 b. fish. He threw some rice over the
ship’s side and lowered a fish-line with a noose to
it into the rice. Brother fish came up, put his
head through the noose, and was promptly caught
by the tail as he passed through.
“Dry” : Sitting on a log on the bank of
the Namoi (N.S.W.) opposite to me was an abo.,
fishing. Binghi’s bare feet were dangling in the
water. Suddenly my attention was drawn to him
by a yell, followed by a splash. A 901 b. cod had
grabbed him by the toes and pulled him under.
Binghi came to the surface, struck out for the
shore, then off for his life to the camp ; he’d had
enough fishing for the day. The cod rose also,
scornfully looked at the retreating abo., opened and
closed its mouth as if rinsing it, and with an
angry slap of the tail dived.
“Gouger”: The little brown hawks of
N.Q. betray the niggers’ whereabouts. They are
great scavengers, and when the abos. burn off grass
the hawks have a feast. They flutter on the out-
skirts of the smoke, scoffing the flying insects and
swooping on the demented lizards that break from
cover ahead of the crackling flames. On the tree
branches skirting the semi-permanent camps some
of the sharp-eyed brown birds are always sitting,
motionless, watching for what they can pinch from
the camp. There is nothing in the food line thrown
away—the gins and dogs see to that. But the
birds swoop into the camp and are away with a
hunk of meat before the niggers’ eyes. I’ve seen
the birds even volplane into the gunyahs.
* * * *
“Dux”: I agree with “Cos” (B. 24/9/’25)
that even a wedding is not permitted to interfere
with milking in the cow country. Recently I re-
ceived an invitation to attend such a ceremony, and
it wound up by saying that the hour (11.30 a.m.)
seemed early, “but most of us have to get back to
the bails before 3 o’clock.”
* * * *
“Wingella”: The gentleman with the cast-
iron skull has his mate in a woman I know. A
young ass was one day swinging a bar-bell about
601 b. in weight, at the end of a long chain, and
let it go. It struck with full force against her
head. From the sound of the crash I thought her
skull had been smashed like an eggshell, but even
the skin was not bruised. On another occasion the
same woman was jumping up to a ledge of rock when
her foot slipped on some mud, and she came full
force against the solid stone, head on. The impact did
not make her even giddy.
“Bris.” : Overheard a drunk challenging a
sober mate to fight in the street. “It’s no good,
Hill,” said the sober one; “you can’t fight me.”
“Why can’t I?” demanded the belligerent drunk.
“Because you can’t run fast enough,” said the other
as he went off.
* * * *
“Two Seas”: Up north, 30 years ago, I
saw a man bury a dingo-trap so cunningly that he
had to keep his eyes on the spot for fear he might
step on it himself when brushing and burning
around it. Yet the next morning One could see
where the dingo had propped at the hidden trap,
circled it and continued along the sheep-pad. The
dingo is the most suspicious animal on earth. Always
on the alert, his scent and sight will warn him
against anything unusual that he approaches when
hunting.
* * * *
“Black Tracker”: 1 live in the Lower
North (S.A.), and some months ago we witnessed
Hocks of thousands of strange birds migrating west-
wards. A local sport succeeded in bringing one to
earth, but though many examined it none had seen
a similar bird before. Measuring about lOin. from
tip to tip, it was bright brown in color, and had
a short head, beady eyes and white feathers under
its wings and near its tail. Not being webfooted
it does not belong to the petrel species, but seems
to be a swift.
“Smiler”: Last autumn on the station ad-
joining my bit of dirt a man was employed for 10
weeks to catch crows. Given award wages and a free
hand, he erected netting traps at various places on
the run with marked success, bagging considerably
more than a thousand crows. The station’s lamb-
marking percentage that season topped the district
records. The secret of his success was that he
always attended to the traps during the night hours.
* * * *
“Slam”: A Queensland line-fislierman has
taken a sft. salt-water jewfish, weighing 701 b., out
of the Brisbane River, many miles from the bay
and in totally fresh water. Which should disprove
the old contention that the big jew is a deep-sea
rover only.
* * * *
“Exul”: “Nitric” (B. 15/10/’25) is cor-
rect in his protest against the folly of removing a
bitten finger as a cure for snakebite. I hope, how-
ever, he may have no deaths on his conscience
through people acting on the statement that the
Tassie black snake is “almost non-venomous.” As
the reptile is identical with the Australian tiger-
snake, the truth is that its venom is among the
most potent poisons in the world. Quantity for
quantity it is even deadlier than the venom of
the mamba. The tiger and the copperhead .are
known in Tasmania as the black and the diamond;
but because the second of these is often confused
with the python of the same name on the mainland,
THE UTILITARIAN.
“Py cripes, Jacky, fat’s not the shingle—
you been cut my hair too short!”
“No fear! Wantit make fishin’-line.”
it is sometimes thought to be non-venomous, where-
as its bite is very dangerous. There is no true
black snake in Tasmania. This confusion between
popular and scientific terminology is a curse, but
I think there are few bush-dwellers in the island
who have any doubts on the subject. The whip-
snake is also venomous, but owing to the small
quantity of poison it can introduce is not regarded
as dangerous.
OUR LITTLE POMMIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was pink and white and dimpled,
And had hair like faded straw;
His fair skin was smooth as satin
Till the sun had burnt it raw.
We engaged him from the city
To do jobs about the farm ;
And he asked -was I the “maister,”
And he called the missus “marm.”
His loose jacket had a belt on
Where I mostly wear a strap ;
On his feet were brogues and stockings,
On his head a pommy’s cap ;
His watch was on a ribbon
That was fastened round his arm ;
And he doffed his cap politely
As he called the missus “marm.”
But he soon cast off the knickers
That were baggy at the knees,
Put on heavy, hob-nailed bluchers
And a pair of dungarees,
Soon got used to us and friendly
And began to call me “choom”;
But the missus didn’t like it
When he changed her name to “moom.”
Yet I felt he surely meant it
When he spoke of me as “mate,”
As he helped me with the milking
And the jobs he used to hate.
He got smarter, kinder daily—
From the missus took the broom ;
Helped to wash and dry the dishes—
So she didn’t mind the “moom.”
Now he says, “This here Australia
Is quite good enough for me.
I’ve more money in my pocket
Than I ever thought I’d see;
And my sister in the Old Dart
Says that she intends to come.
I have never known a mother—
May I call the missus ‘mum’ ?”

Prominent Analyst Proves the
Purity of H.V.A. Seed Tapioca.
11 An invaluable addition to our Summer diet!”
READ what a well-known analyst, John A. Cresswick, F.C.S.,
A.A.C.L, says of H.V.A., the clean seed tapioca. H.V.A. is
cleaner, whiter and purer than common tapioca, requires no
washing, no soaking, and cooks in ten minutes. It is very easy to digest
and makes delicious desserts. Here is Mr. Cresswick’s report on this
energy-producing food that contains all the food elements necessary
to perfect health.
JOHN A. CRESSWICK, F.C.S., A.A.C.L
Member of the Society of Chemical Industry.
Consulting Chemical Engineer Metropolitan Meat Industry Board.
1 7th September, 1925.
A. G. Tomlinson, Ltd., 431 a Kent Street, Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —After thorough examination of your H.V.A. Superfine
Seed Tapioca as compared with various samples of commercial sago,
I have to report as follows:
H.V.A. Superfine Seed Tapioca is a carbohydrate food material of
consistent composition, texture and color which is not shown by any
other sample of ordinary sago examined.
The freedom from impurities such as dirt and grit indicates standard-
ised hygienic factory conditions at the period of manufacture, and the
present packing methods ensure that this condition is preserved until
it reaches the consumer.
The samples were completely cooked in ten minutes to a smooth
appetising food, which has a digestibility with diastase (or malt extract)
of 95 per cent, in five minutes, and which is 20 per cent, greater than
any other sample of sago examined.
Ease of digestion is of utmost importance in a carbohydrate food,
therefore H.V.A. Superfine Seed Tapioca supplies a source of reliable,
easily prepared, food material which should form an invaluable addition
to our summer diet.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) JOHN A. CRESSWICK,
Consulting Chemical Engineer.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER

STOCKINGS
The State is still thinking deeply over the
problem of its T.B. sufferers. Living-space
they must have, and a settlement set square
to the winds of Heaven and the sun’s rays
seems the best way back to health that has
been offered them. To build up the fund
that is to make the colony possible, a super-
carnival will reign at the Stadium on Novem-
ber 17.
In a city whose dance season is frayed at
the edges, the Feminist Club was one of the
high lights of last week, for the Feminists
sported amid the gay streamer and the bob-
bing balloon that are the boon companions
of jazz, and introduced the Russian dancer
Michailovska, who is creating something of
a riot by her panther-like performances.
The lady, dark, vivid and sinuous, seems
to ripple into motion from her head to her
toes, and is alternately dramatic, sombre
and gay. Ruby Rich, who did the honors,
flew her favorite lilac and silver, carried out
in moire and lace. Mrs. Osborne England’s
tall fairness emerged from black georgettes,
and Mrs. Liddell trailed black velvets,
crusted with mother o’ pearl, through a night
that was mostly young things pursuing
pleasure with that last-of-the-season zip
which makes the rafters ring and the win-
dows shake in their sockets.
With an optimism that strikes cannot
quell nor the Christmas shopper wither,
Maud Fane, just out of a bed of sickness, is
set on raising her £5OO for St. Margaret’s
Hospital. What Lee White, Dot Brunton,
Josie Melville and Gladys Moncrieff have
done, Maud Fane intends to do, though
Walsh and Rolsh and even Lulu come to
the party. So the bright lady, in a lacquer
red-and-white tunic suit and a black hat
pierced with a red quill, descended on the
Ambassadors the other afternoon when the
cabaret she had instigated was sparking in
all its cylinders. Flinging herself into the
maelstrom (the place was full to suffoca-
tion), Maud got to work with guessing com-
petitions, in which she was assisted by Peter
and Diana, her small boy and girl. Later
she carolled “Mary,” to the joy of the listeners ;
and Genelle Parker and Blossom Edmeades
were others who did an imitation of the
earth-bound skylark. President Mrs. Stew-
art Dawson had Marie Narelle in her party,
and St. Margaret enthusiasts like Mrs. W.
D. Langton, Sister Kerven, the Maitland
widow and Mrs. Wunderlich were associated
with the success.
When will the odor of Billy Hughes’s
£25,000 die? It even snarked Miss Preston
Stanley’s presentation cheque the other
afternoon. When ‘Miss Macdonald, of the
Garden School, decided to organise the tea-
and-cheque party for our woman member,
Dame Mary Hughes pointed out the objec-
tion to making the appeal widespread, as Mr.
Hughes had suffered unpleasantness through
his acceptance of a cheque from his friends.
So although legions of Miss Preston Stan-
ley’s admirers turned into the shining new
tearoom, the Cuckoo Clock, on Saturday, and
drank deep to her glorification, the cheque
when handed over reached only £52. Then,
although it was the lady M.L.A.’s party,
somebody got to work and turned it into
a meeting to found a Parliamentary women’s
fighting fund, so that Miss Stanley may
have a backing of her own sex.
Dr. Truby King’s method for making bet-
ter babies is going to be given a chance to
prove its merits if the committee responsible
for last week’s dance at the Palais knows
anything about it. While mere men are
arguing whether the decrease in the infant
mortality in Maoriland is greater or less
than the decrease-in Australia over a certain
number of years, mothers and embryo
mothers only see that the N. S. Wales per-
centage of lost babies is a good deal ahead
of that in the isles. So to help build up
the £5OOO necessary to keep Karitane, the
Truby King stronghold at Coogee, going, a
bunch of enthusiasts organised the successful
charity dance of last week. The Coombe
lady, once of Perth, was president of the
committee, and Mrs. R. Raynor the organ-
iser of the flutter. Moira Brady, Mrs.
Fred Lassetter, Molly Street, Mrs. A. B.
Hill and Mrs. Ken Austin were others who
helped.
Just as this letter slips into its new pink
tunic the Chief Justice Adrian Knoxes’ Mar-
garet is interesting herself with matrimony
at St. John’s, in Darlinghurst. The young
man is B. C. Poole, of Marbury, Shropshire.
Sister Elizabeth, Morna McCormick, Mollie
Street, Elizabeth Macarthur Onslow and
Helen Stephen are booked as chief atten-
dants.
Another bride who dispensed with the
tulle trappings of triumph was Marjorie
Leigh-Jones, of Chatswood, who wore a pic-
turesque crinoline hat and sand-colored
morocain frocking for her wedding with Dr.
Tristram Holcombe, of Hunter’s Hill. Mr.
Leigh-Jones squired his only daughter to
the altar of St. Philip’s, and one maid fol-
lowed the bride. Petty’s housed a reception
presided over by the bride’s parents. Stroud,
on the North Coast, is where the doctor
hangs out his sign.
Dale Collins, who began his career as a
novelist with the brilliantly successful
“Ordeal,” has been to see Melbourne and
mother, and, having a contract for another
novel hanging over his head, has come back
to Sydney and Hampton Court to collect
some inspiration. He finds it much easier,
though, to collect hospitality, and so far
his typewriter hasn’t had much exercise.
And there’s little more than a fortnight to
go, according to present plans, before it has
to be packed up and taken north ; for Dale
Collins has promised himself a look at
Burmah before he returns to London.
He frankly confesses that he likek the
business side of writing as much as the
purely literary side. One of his pet ideas
is that Barabbas and the other publishers
have cultivated the idea that it is really
rather degrading for a writer to think about
finance; and in the end the writer—especi-
ally the young writer—has left “all that
sort of thing” to Barabbas. Collins hasn’t
any scruples about driving the best bargain
he can; none, either, in urging other young
writers to do the same thing.
Roger Triau, the new attache at the
French Consul-General’s office, arrivdd by
the Ville de Verdun in good time for the
Sydney office to maintain its reputation as
the only Consulate owning a brace of bache-
lors—Consul-General Nettement will join the
army of benedicts at the year’s end. M.
Triau’s last post was at Milan; he is a like-
able young man, speaks excellent English,
and, having all the instincts of a home-
maker, has already purchased a cottage at
Wahroonga and started a garden.
Say hail and farewell to Lizette Parkes,
the most appealing Peter Pan Australia has
known. Lizette
played her big-
gest part last
Satur d a y,
though it was
one of the
shortest. Be-
fore a strictly
limited audi-
ence she said
“I will” to
Dr. William
Andrews, of
Campsie. A
frock like the
petal of a
pink rose and
a hat like a
sun-gold cloud
adorned th e
pretty crea-
ture when
brother Jim
armed her up
'the aisle of St. Philip’s. Not even a
bouquet did Lizette clutch, but an ivory-
backed prayer-book sustained her under the
cross-examination of Canon Bellingham. The
wedding-meats were eaten in the seclusion of
the bride’s family circle, and a motor trip
among the mountain-tops will precede the
settling down in the Campsie practice. Liz-
ette was a home-grown actress. She had a
great flair for comedy, but her good looks
almost always condemned her to play sweet
young heroines. Peter Pan was her greatest
achievement, and, strangely enough, she
never got a chance to let her own city of
Sydney see her as that sprite. The lucky
doctor, a Melbourne graduate, was for some
years on the staff of St. Vincent's and the
Melbourne Hospital.
Pianist Vinogradoff’s Thursday recitals at
the Royal Colonial Institute have been a
joy to the musical. Seated on the tiny
stage, with one. standard lamp glowing
(the hard electrics are switched off), he
makes mere woman alternate between the
tiger-cat she suspects in moments of tempera-
ment she really is and the petted Persian
of prosperity she knows Nature intended her
to be. His playing is full of fire and a
curiously intimate descriptive quality that
may, lacking a more suitable word, be de-
scribed as atmosphere. In a musician of
standing the audience takes purity of tone
and technical dexterity for granted; it is
just the extra surge of personality, of warm
vitality, that grips Vinogradoff’s listeners
and puts the ring of real enthusiasm into
their applause.
One of Sydney’s cleverest younger artists,
Roy de Mestre, returned by the Maloja
minus his appendix (he left that in Paris)
but plus much knowledge of European art.
He is just the same keen enthusiast and
modest young man who earlier worked out
his theories of color sounds in his studio in
Little George-street. Since then a Society
of Artists’ travelling scholarship and keen
study have gained him the distinction of
being an exhibitor at the Paris Salon. The
other night the Society of Artists spread a
dinner at the Horseshoe in his honor, when
Roy voiced his deduction that the young
Australian artist dissipates his energies too
much. He likes to think himself something
of a writer, or a musician, or an inventor,
a kind of modern Leonardo da Vinci. It is
not like that in Europe. There the young
artist woos his Art alone. The young man
has brought back with him sufficient expres-
sions of his varying moods to stock a small
exhibition which he will stage at an early
date, probably before Christmas.
An interesting exhibition of his pictures is
being sliown by Meade Norton (that’s his
face at the
window) in the
Macquarie Gal-
leries. It is
by way of a
farewell ges-
ture to his
home-town be-
fore he sets off
to learn what
Europe has to
teach him. Not
a great deal
in the way of
drawing, judg-
ing by the
sound work in
the little show;
but he is look-
ing forward to
the fresh vis-
tas the jour-
ney will open
up mentally.
Mr. Norton
owns to being mainly self-taught, and is
proud of having won his way into the shows
of the Society of Artists. Lovers of Palm
Beach and Deewhy will be delighted by the
reproductions of these beauty-spots in Mr.
Norton’s show.
The Sailors’ Wives had a relish to their
tea at their last monthly party in the Naval
House. Russian-dancer Iva Michailovska
was the star performer at the afternoon’s
concert, and she brought to the tiny bare
stage a fluency of motion and an intensity
of expression that made the sailors’ wives
positively blink and then burst into the
concert equivalent of three cheers. Mrs.
George Earp, who arranged the music, sang,
and Rhys Kemmis played her fiddle. Com-
mander Robins’s lady was hostess-in-chief,
and thq pink-and-white Miss Corbett, who is
the union’s secretary, saw to the smooth
working of the parts.
When whipped up Sydney will turn out in
force td hear its own composers; witness the
packed-tieht audience at the Adyar Hall the
other night when Alfred Hill’s “Carnival”
and works by a group of Australian music-
writers were offered by the British Music
Society. Another notable event of the even-
ing was a sonata for violin and piano by
Christian Hellermann. Songs by Clive
Carey, Ramsay Pennycuick and Bindley
Evans were sung by Dr. F. R. Crouch and
Maorilander Eva Webb-Jones, who invested
Mr. Pennycuick’s “Innisfree” with the melt-
ing charm. Gertrude Burton, who organised
the concert, deserves honorable mention. So
does a Fritz Hart setting of “May in a
Green Wood”: among the singers were
Edith Lung, Valentine Blofield, Ellen Green
and Meryl Holliday.
This letter dropped into the Prince Edward
the other morning to see “East Lynne”
through the movie director’s eye. The plot
is speeded up here and there; otherwise the
story is much the same as when our mothers
wept over Little Willie and Lady Isabel.
Queerly enough, the old-fashioned authoress
who spent most of her life “confined to her
couch,” in the popular parlance of her time,
probably pioneered the trick of turning the
chorus of sympathy in the direction of the
Prodigal Mother. The misguided Lady Isa-
bel, who snatched at her cake only to find it
dough, evoked a wave of pity that threatened
to sap the foundations of British respect-
ability long before the Divorce Court had
become the Mecca of peer and peasant alike.
Let Barbara Hare (the one who annexed
the husband who stayed at home when his
lady eloped) be as good as gold and sweet
as honey, Lady Isabel was the darling of
Suburbia. Of course, being of her time, Mrs.
Henry Wood cleared the decks of both Little
Willie and his frail mother; the author of
to-day would make her drive up, in a spank-
ing grey car, snatch the coughing Willie
from the doorstep, rush him to Spahlinger,
and end up by dressing his little plump hams
in the satin breeches of a mediaeval page, in
order that he might steer her train to the
altar when she had decided to take another
dose of matrimony plus an Argentine mil-
lionaire.
Duncan MacDougall, the intrepid pro-
ducer, juggled another laugh-raiser on to the
tiny stage of his Playbox last week. It is
“Knock, or the Triumph of Medicine/’ and
is by Jules Romains. Again the audience
in the little theatre was struck by the clever
character-work of the players—Mr. Macdou-
gall really works wonders with material,
and docs sound work himself as Knock, the
charlatan who takes over a general, practice
in a staggeringly healthy community, and,
happily for himelf and the chemist, turns
it into a colony of hypochondriacs. The
play will be repeated every Wednesday at
the tiny theatre in Rowe-street till the
middle of December.
Now open at Paling’s the plan for Dag-
mar Thomson’s violin recital. The tall, fair
Mosman girl has attracted much attention in
two recitals since her return from Europe
last year, and on this occasion her pro-
gramme will include a Moeran Sonata new
to Sydney. The Conservatorium will harbor
the concert on the 17th.
Singer Nellie Leach has given up the
thought of grand opera, for the time being,
anyway, and has opened a hat and frock
shop in Grafton-street, London. The estab-
lishment is known as Camelot, and Nellie
has for partner a sister-in-law of Winston
Churchill.
Across the junction between Hunter and
Pitt streets (Sydney) a little old woman in
faded black pattered. A big draught-horse
in a brewery-lorry, manoeuvring out of the
way of two motor-cars, flopped back on its
haunches, and the foam from its jaws fell
on the old lady’s liat. A torrent of invec-
tive rose to the lips of the indignant driver,
and then he grinned. The old lady pattered
over to the pavement without looking round.
She was knitting.
May Summerbelle came home again on
the Ballarat, after a long visit to England
and the Continent. One of her successful
recent compositions, “Scarlet-Gold,” a march,
has been adopted by the Grenadier Guards
band.
Both the Australia and the Wentworth
have now magazines of their very own. From
the Wentworth is issued an art publication,
well printed and profusely illustrated and
containing stories and verse by well-known
writers. The Australia, on the other hand,
deals only with matters that concern its own
colony. Visitors who have stayed at the
hotel appear on its pages in photograph and
caricature, and pleasant tilings that distin-
guished travellers have said about our con-
tinent are found on every page.
Sydney is to have still another dancing-
floor. The “Glassy” has been turned into
an up-to-date ballroom, with a shoe-enticing
space where the skate made merry in the
colder months. Boxes, circle, enclosure —
everything is to be in the most correct
fashion; and the nights are to be divided
into Popular and Dress.
Some Brisbane gleanings:—
St. Andrew’s, at Toogoolwah, saw the wedding
of Robert Ware, of England, to Linda May Slaughter
under a huge joy-bell erected by the choir. The
bride, in ivory charmante, was given away by her
father. Mona Slaughter, in mauve silk, and
Ena Brown, in cream georgette, ’maided, while Kitty
Young was flower-girl in apricot. Henry Mackawav
best-manned, Frank Noble ’groomed, ilenzies’ saw
the feasting, and the Blue Mountains watch the
’moon run its delirious course.
Roses and gaillardias decked the Lyceum Club
rooms for Lady Heath, who, with her husband, the
English industrial science expert, has been staying
at Montpelier. Dr. .Tean White-llaney, the president,
gave her a bouquet of mauve water-lilies.
For the new Children’s Hospital Dr. H. J.
Windsor’s wife staged mah jongg and music at
the Gresham against a frieze of daisies and lupins.
Dora Warby, from Cremorne, raised her nice soprano
notes, and Fred Monument and Harry Avondale did
their bit. Mrs. Jolly, Mrs. T. J. Ryan, Mrs. Gillies
and Mrs. Von Ploennies were in the crowd.
“ ’Possum Paddock” Kate Howarde is dusting
out the Theatre Royal for a re-opening night. Victor
Gouriet is with this company, and “The Tide Rises”
is the first offering.
The Peter Macgregors poured tea in their home
at Bowen-terrace to help along the Girl Guide
movement. Mah jongg and bridge broke out in the
house and on the verandahs with their green-creeper
curtains, and afternoon tea made an oasis in the
wilderness.
The R.Q.Y.C. had fine weather for the hydroplane
championship in the Hamilton reach. The Doomba,
flagship, carried the Lieut.-Governor. G. Whatmore
piloted his fine new yacht, the Stradbroke, and num-
bered amongst his passengers the Stables, the What-
mores, jun., Dr. Holmes and the Biggses. The Camp-
bells also had a party on the Mavis; and the river-
bank was packed with interested watchers.
Albion Park’s minor racing frenzy, the Albion
Thousand, was run on a day that brought out gay
parasols and summer frocking like a scattered posy
on the lawns. The president and committee brewed
souchong on the balcony amid white and purple
blossomry. Amongst the smartest frocking was Mrs.
Tyrwhitt’s white crepe de Chine with mauve stripes.
Mollie Brenan hoisted black, and Ivy Clark navy
and red.
The Women’s Club kept Hallowe’en with its witch-
like solemnities, and the members received the pre-
sumably startled guests wrapped in sheets. Apple-
bobbing, fortune-telling and other dark rites went
forward in an atmosphere full of black cats and
hobgoblins.

Money Power.
Perhaps the greatest power in the world to-day, the
Commercial world at any rate, is money, not merely hoarded,
unproductive money, but thriftily conserved resources, avail-
able for immediate use when the occasion demands.
If all the money lost by hasty speculation and unwise
spending had been placed in a Savings Bank, how much
happier and more prosperous the people would be, what
opportunity for progress, individual and national, would now
be theirs!
The time to save is now, and the opportunity is provided

MISSES MONKE DOVLE
Phones Cotral 1532, 1533.
The Stonehavens staged their first ball
at Federal Government House on Oaks
night, when some two thousand rolled up
to a party at which things were done in
the grand style. Only once could the cap-
tious murmur “The Forsters never did so.”
That once was when their Excellencies, with
the State and visiting vice-regals, and about
eight or ten local elect, representing the
naval, military, judicial and political worlds,
went off like unto the Israelites departing
for the Promised Land to partake of their
bird and wine in private, instead of supper-
ing with the throng. Azaleas bloomed
around ballroom and drawing-rooms, crim-
son l'oses shedding fragrance over the food.
Lady Stonehaven added to her cloth-of-silver
apparel a train and front panelling of
emerald-green and gold brocade in harlequin
design; diamonds wriggled around her coif-
fure, and she waved a green feather fan.
A black trained robe, much crystal-beaded,
and lovely pearls and diamonds, were dis-
played by Lady Stradbroke. Petunia and
silver lame, brocade and georgette draped
Lady de Chair, who added ropes of pearls
and diamonds and a white feather fan. The
G.-G., in court dress, his lady and the N. S.
Wales vice-regals joined the jazzers for
several measures.
Pauline Curran, of the Apple Isle, led the
bead-adorned in periwinkle-blue sheathing
sparkling with diainente and scrawled with a
conventional design in orange, dull red and
green; Mrs. Tony Hordern came a good
second with a chalk-pink pattern on the
faintest of pink georgette, and Mrs. Fisken
gave a walking demonstration of the embroi-
dery art with a rose-and-gold design upon
purple upholstery. Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers's
gown of silver and mauve lame embossed
with gold and opalescent sequins, caused
many heads to twist. Elaine de Chair flitted
in powder-blue taffeta and silver lace, Mar-
garet O’Grady jazzed in blue and silver, and
Lady Helena Rous aired Oriental red. Pretty
Morna MacCormick maintained the Harbor
City’s reputation in clouds of shaded apple-
green georgette with pink and petunia-hued
rosebuds dangling from one shoulder. Pauline
Watt, who had a pale green covering; Enid
Falkiner with a geranium-red sash upon
white georgette; Susan Spenser, wearing
cobalt-blue with a tunic of crystal lace, and
Jean Wardle, in white and silver, were some
of the sister States’. pretty younger set.
Helen Lempriere, only chick of the C. A.
Lemprieres, made her first bow in shimmer-
ing cloth of silver, filmy lace and a posy of
lily-of-the-valley.
Six thousand pairs of feet trod down the
daisies at Federal Government House on
Friday afternoon, and steadily, for a long, long
hour, the G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven held
out cramped fingers to the almost unending
caterpillar of variously covered humanity
which stepped out of its limousine cocoons
or a plain electric-tram, and crawled along
in glorious sunshine to the strains of a
brass band. Lady Stonehaven was a study
in nattier blue; Lady Stradbroke, who with
her lord also took the salute, had some gold
stitching upon black draperies, and a hat to
match. Lady de Chair roved the lawn in
needle-run lace and cool-looking cafe-au-lait
draperies, with millinery in tune. Lady
Helena Rous, in hydrangea-blue floral chiffon,
topped by a brown hat; Mrs. Norman
Brookes, in beige georgette, with long cape
bordered with lace and a crinoline hat; and
Mrs. Lane Poole, a froth of fawn georgette
and lace, were of the smartly clad. Mrs. Mc-
Inerney, lately returned with her Colonel
from abroad, had novel covering of rust-rod
with gauntlet cuffs and pockets of black,
bead-embroidered. Their daughter was a
charming landscape in pleated green with a
white lid.
Oaks Day, which usually provides the star
dress-parade, was a disappointment this year.
Weather conditions were far from roseate
in the early morning. Those who risked
light apparel were top-dressed with furs and
coats, and thanked the fates for the inspira-
tion, for, though gloriously fine, the wind was
freezing. Mink and ermine wraps gave an
air of opulence to quite ordinary frocks.
Black and the popular cross-shades of fawns
and browns in ensemble suits led by lengths.
Of course there were chiffon, georgette and
lace confections, gayest of gay hats, and some
dinky parasols, the prettiest of these last
being blue, sprinkled with beaded pink rose-
buds. allied to raiment of saxe-blue georgette
and ecru lace. The vice-regals were again
in force, and should have had a good day,
seeing that Governor Stradbroke’s Night
Patrol secured the Linlithgow Stakes.
Lad" Stonehaven had long streamers of gold
brown velvet dangling from her neck over
ensemble of fawn, embroidered in self tones,
her small black millinery bunched with rib-
bon. Beneath a black fur-trimmed coat
Lady Stradbroke displayed black apparel
with a touch of gold, and a black crin. hat.
Lady de Chair pulled a silver and black
brocaded coat over floral marocain and
hoisted black velvet upon her cream picture-
headpiece, while daughter Elaine braved the
breeze in cornflower-blue frocking and a rose-
decked Tuscan liat. Hon. -Mrs. Pitt Rivers
wore apparel of beige hue, and gardenias sat
upon her dull-green millinery. Lady Helena
Rous watched events from under a brick-red
picture hat. with a black two-piece toilette.
Mrs. G. Vivers hid her choice beneath a
mole fur cape, worn with a blue crinoline
straw. Tassy’s Governor O’Grady’s attrac-
tive daughter Margaret combined cherry and
black in frock and lid. The rest of the vice-
regal party, which was augmented at lun-
cheon, consisted of Marcia Allen in putty-
hued raiment and Una Woolf, a study in
blue.
Mrs. Norman Armytage, who topped dark-
green frocking with black hat, daisy-adorned,
and her daiighter-in-law, Mrs. Charles Army-
tage, arrayed in tonings of blue and pink,
passed the afternoon tea-cups under the elms
for some 300 guests; of the partied being
Governor Stradbroke, his countess and the
selected of local and visiting society. Mrs.
Agar Wynne, whose apparel was black,
spread her tea-cloth in the committee-room
for a large party.
The fact that forbidden pleasures are the
most desired was brilliantly demonstrated
during the Cup meeting, when the sign
Ladies are not allowed to bet” was dis-
played at the ringside. This tampering with
their liberty stirred furious opposition in the
sex, and she who never gambled before had
her bit on in spite of the law. llow was it
done? Virtuous bookie: “Madame, I cannot
bet with you—give your money to a gentle-
man.” Then, to collaborating male: “Bill,
pass over the lady’s half-note!” So the
money travelled to the ponciller, thence to
the gent, calling the odds, back came the
card in the same way, and everyone was
happy and law-abiding.
Notwithstanding the loophole, women
don’t like it, and will be glad to see the
tote at Flemington and Caulfield; and many
a State member’s job hangs upon his outlook
on the coming Totalisator Bill.
Here you have the classic features of
Beatrice Ternan, who promises to be a second
Dorothea
Spinney. She
hails from S.
Aus., but
dwells in Mel-
bourne, where
of late she has
been fascinat-
ing the kid-
dies with her
deli glitfully
natural Chil-
dren’s Story
Hours, a reci-
tal of fairy
tales too likely
to be lost
these days of
movies. Irene
Vanbrugh
urged Miss
Ternan to look
to Europe—
“ With your
voice, your face and figure, m’dear, there’d
be no stopping you!” So far she has not
been able to take the advice, but she hopes
to try her paces in London before many
ships sail away. Lafayette made the picture.
The V.R.C. should this year hand over
a nice cheque to the Mayor’s Hospital fund
if only in thanksgiving for the beautiful
weather bestowed on the Cup meeting. The
last day of the frenzy was as thoroughly
enjoyable as Derby Day, and anyone lucky
enough to have an unworn gown or hat came
forth in rejuvenated glory. Again parasols
made a great glow of color on the lawns and
big hats bobbed like prize chrysanthemums.
The younger set has started a craze for huge
headpieces of felt or crinoline straw turned
sharply off the face, and fastened with a
brilliant ornament, the only trimming. These
new felts are of light weight, and occasion-
ally have a perforated design. Hose in
shaded colors adorned with butterflies arid
garter bands were freakish fancies noticed
in the crush.
Mrs. Barry Thomson carried a pretty
golden-brown crin. straw above twine-colored
lace and georgette gowning; Mrs. de Berigny
aired black brightened with petunia, and her
sister Miss Mason wore sand-hued crepe de
Chine and black millinery. Mrs. J. Osborne
carried a pale lemon ensemble suit with
lioney-hued crinoline hat. Vera de Bavay
was in one of the daintiest of coverings,
white georgette painted at intervals with
roses; and Margaret Thomas was an iris, in
mauve georgette and headpiece. Mrs. Clive
Leonard was a study in pink in frocking
and hat, and some Oriental scribe had
painted Chinese verses on Mrs. Harry
Whiting's white silk crepe.
Many spectators of the exquisitely-painted
flowers and fine landscapes that adorned Carl
Hampel’s re-
cent show at
the Decoration
Co.’s Gal-
leries con-
cluded that the
artist was a
much - taught
and much-tra-
velled person.
The youthful
painter wli o

D i c k i n son-

ture, is neither;
a few hints
gathered in
his home town
of Bendigo
from an artist
friend, a pupil
of Algernon
Talmage, R.A., and a quarter’s tuition from
Douglas Richardson are all the fostering his
talent has had. He began life’s toil in the
P.M.G.’s department.* Unable to go soldier-
ing in the Big Scrap he did his brother’s
job of farming to enable him to enlist. Not
until 1920 did he paint professionally, Gee-
long having his first show. The following year
lie sold his first study of flowers for nine
guineas; three years later, at Wembley, a
similar canvas a few inches larger brought
a cheque of 100 guineas. Melbourne’s art
patrons have discovered Carl Hampel, but
the trustees of the National Art Gallery, who
move slowly, have yet to find him.
Curls, crinolines and chignons added sar-
torial interest to John Drinkwater’s “Abra-
ham Lincoln” on Saturday night at the Play-
house. For weeks past Repertorians have
been gathering old lace and other heirlooms
as setting for the piece. Mrs. George Bel-
lew designed and made the dresses, and
the peg-top trousers and frock-coats of the
male artists were dredged from wardrobes as
far afield as Bananaland. Mrs. George Bell
plays Mrs. Lincoln in a delightful white-
embroidered gown of much antiquity and
a hooped diving-bell of crimson silk and
black lace; and Ruby May pulls a wonder-
ful Paisley cape over her period gown, and
tops it with the flattest of pink straw hats.
The last scene displays frocks of apple-green,
salmon-pink with loopings of gold, clierry-
red and figured taffeta; and all the little
etceteras of ivory fans, wee posies and short
gloves bring the costuming right back to date.
Helton Daniell, who hunted up the relics for
the stage settings, also secured some delight-
ful props.
“Archie,” who made his first appearance
at the Princess on Saturday night, though
not nearly so charming as “Jimmy Smith,”
had, nevertheless, all the latter’s attractive
lady friends, and they wore lovely clothes.
May Beatty wears ensemble raiment of lime
hue, and dangles a black feather from her
black crinoline lid that trails below her
waist. Madge White trips in in white with
cape lined with red to tone with her sports
hat; her petunia-velvet frock has long sleeves
and flounce of vellum-silk lace; and some
pastel-bead embroideries decorate a peri-
winkle-blue robe. Elsie Prince wanders around
almost hidden under a crin. hat of petunia
hue allied to flowered raiment; her white
frock sparkles with crystal. As in all Hugh
Ward shows there is heaps of dancing, much
of it clever, all of it unusual. The Benja-
min Fuller pair and their two daughters,
Miss Moore, Mrs. Barry Thomson, Hugh
Ward and Mrs. J. Brenan watched pro-
ceedings from the boxes.
For the Stradbrokes’ evening reception
during carnival week Stonington’s limited
accommodation was ,not taxed, our sporting
Governor and his wife having apparently
decided to make a pleasant evening for their
personal friends. So any accidental bump
found the offender almost inevitably apolo-
gising into the monocled eye of an aide or
begging pardon of some vice-reine.
Forty maidens footed the bill the
only big dance of Cup night. The St. Kilda
Town Hall, decorated with streamers and
flowers of heliotrope and rose hues, sheltered
the party, which was secretaried by Rose
Bullen.
The Robert Simsons’ jazz at the Embassy
was attended by Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers,
Elaine de Chair and Margaret O’Grady, who
went on from the Stradbrokes’ reception.
Lady Helena Rous, in mauve draperies; Una
Woolf, wearing shaded pink frocking; and
Marcia Allen, frocked in yellow and gold,
were of the elect. And Mrs. Tony Hordern
and Mrs. Oliver Osborne were smart frockers
in the crush. The hostess wore glistening
black; her daughter Estelle was a dainty
sprite in bead-sprinkled green.
The lore of gardening in a nutshell is
supplied in “My Garden Calendar,” com-
piled by Edith Murphy, daughter of the
11. M. Murphys, of South Yarra. The lady,
who studied at the Burnley School, tells you
what to plant each month, and what to tip
out, and prescribes the kindly treatment of
soil and vegetation that goes to make the
glory of a garden.
From the 16tli onwards for a few days
Robertson and Mullens’s Gallery will house
an interesting show of enamels by the Eng-
lish artist Fleetwood Yarley, a water-colorist.
Many of the lovely scenic bits are mounted
in gold and silver, and a few portrait studies
in their finish suggest miniatures. Members
of the Arts and Crafts who go in for metal-
craft and jewellery-designing will find this
exhibition particularly entertaining.
Among the multitude of Melbourne's Cup-
time visitors none has felt heartier hand-
grips than A. E. A. Williamson, a member
of the Union Parliament of South Africa.
He is a native of Victoria, and is well re-
membered by Diggers whom he entertained
lavishly when Australian transports looked
in at S’Africa. Cricketers, too, recall his
hospitality as president of the S’African
Cricket Association.
An interesting show, opening on Novem-
ber IS at the Fine Arts Gallery, will be a
collection of works by Tom Humphrey, who
died about three years ago. Mrs. Humphrey,
professionally known as Alice Mills, has
been loaned many canvases by their
owners. The artist, who was dogged by jbad
health, was unable to keep constantly at his
easel, so there are not a tremendous numbef
of his paintings about. He was a founder of
the Vic. Artists’ Society, and one of his
landscapes is at tin; National Art Gallery,
where he was a student.
Edna Thomas, who goes to Sydney this
week, poured an informal cup on Saturday.
Among the guests of the lady of the negro
spirituals at Menzies’ were Mrs. Tony Hor-
dern, in the prettiest of geranium-red turn-
outs ; Commander and Mrs. Fcakes; and
Mrs. Harold Clapp, wearing a fawn and
blue-figured gown.
Lorna Pounds put into this haven quite
unexpectedly the other day for a short holi-
day. She is due back in Loudon at Christ-
mas time. That won’t allow her to stay
many minutes at the Oriental.
Sister Adelaide’s “by the way”:—
The committee of the Lady Victoria Buxton Girls’
Club is in quest of £5OOO for urgentlv-needed
expansion. In its early days the club (it was
founded in ’9B as a meeting-place for factory-girls
and others from the poorer parts of the city) was
educational and social only, but in 1914 it became
residential, thereby hoping to fulfil one of its most
useful purposes. But demand far exceeds accommo-
dation, and when five homeless girls had reluctantly
been refused admission within three weeks the
committee in desperation took an option over an
adjoining house. A larger hall is badly needed,
too. Hence the SOS for funds.
The new kindergarten, whose fetch was lifted by
Mrs. Poole the other day, is the result of a gift
of £2OOO from the Keith Sheridan Trust, and
claims to be one of the best-appointed in the
Commonwealth. It takes the place of the old
Halifax School, which has been doing good work
since our early days of kindergartening.
A night o’ speech-making in the Public Library’s
lecture-room marked the Catherine Helen Spence
centenary. Eight elocutionists followed Chairman
J. H. Vaughan in testifying to the lady’s activities
and excellencies. At the Old Folks’ Home in the
afternoon—the dead lady was the first feminine
member of the Destitute Board —there was tea and
the gift of a memorial wheel-chair.
The modern infant seems to be born with a
dance sprite in its toes ; whereof Wanda Edwards’s
pupils have just given demonstration at the Nor-
wood Town Hall. Greek classic dancing and a
toe-hopping by a very small Lorraine Angus were
equally delightful.
At Strathalbyn polo has come in. Mrs. Lionel
Tucker presided over the tea-table at the first
practice game. ' The southern club proposes to train
till early December, knock off to get the harvest
in till mid-January, and then start again.
The Moulden lady opened the Society of Artists’
exhibition in the Dunster Galleries. Like most things,
the show suffered by the strike, and the non-arrival
of the Melbourne pictures gave chief hangman H.
Britton a worrying time. Of Sydneysiders, Mar-
garet Preston’s work came in for specially friendly
glances, and S.A. etchers Britton, Van Raalte and
Goodchild gave a specially good account of them-
selves.
Glenelg, Adelaide’s oldest and most crowded sea-
side place, is to have a really up-to-date hotel. The
old Jetty, which has been almost lost among the
growth of small shops, is to be rebuilt by its present
owner, Krantz, lately of Broken Hill, and to become
(like all new places) “one of the most up-to-date
in the Commonwealth.” Cost, about £70,000.
Narracoorte claims to have discovered much nearer
the town a fresh cave superior to those which
have for years attracted tourists. Much of that
south-eastern district of the State is limestone com-
pletely honeycombed ; but fresh caves are found only
by an occasional cow falling through the crust, or,
as in this ease, by painstaking exploration of surface
cracks.

NOTIONS
Windbag’s Melbourne Clip win took a tidy
parcel out of the ring, though not nearly so much
as has been alleged ; but MdShortodds got it all
back, with usurious interest, during the remaining
days of the meeting, in which favorites fared badly
on the whole. Windbag himself failed in the O.
B. Fisher Plate, 12 furlongs, on Saturday, just as
Poitrel did after his Cup. The Magpie four-year-old
was always at odds-on —2 to 1 on at the close —
while Pilliewinkie was 9 to 2 against, Heroic 7 to 1
and Pantheon 10 to 1. Heroic, on the outside,
caused no trouble, and, going to the front immedi-
ately, led out of the straight, with Windbag,
Pantheon and Pilliewinkie in that order. There
was no pace on nor any change in the positions till
about six furlongs from home, where Windbag was
a little ahead of Heroic, with Pilliewinkie still
last. Once in the straight, Pilliewinkie moved up
fast and, finishing in great style, he beat Windbag
by a length and a half; Pantheon was the same
distance away third and Heroic, eased up, eight
lengths behind the English horse. Windbag may
have gone off after his great Cup effort, but he
looked bright enough. Perhaps he would have done
better if Munro had taken him to the front and
made his own pace, instead of letting the field muddle
along; as it was, the race was run in the slow time
of 2min. 39jsee. However, no one begrudged
Samuel Hordern his victory with Pilliewinkie, whom
Young rides uncommonly well.
The Batman Stakes for three-year-olds was sup-
posed to be a good thing for the unlucky Ambassador,
who had run second to Mercian King in the Van
Yean Stakes on Cup Day, and Barlow’s colt started
at 6 to 4 against. Amounis was substantially sup-
ported at 5 to 2, and Ethelton, who had been
downed in the Oaks by the Thrice—Red Streak
filly Red Shank, was at B’s, with Hampden at the
same figure and King of Oude at 16's. Ethelton
led round the turn, but Amounis and Hampden were
together at the distance, and in a good finish the
Magpie gelding from Sydney passed the judge’s box
a neck in front of Hampden, with King of Oude and
Ambassador, a head away, dead-heating for third
place. Bracken had the mount on Amounis, who ran
the mile in lmin. 41sec.
A Valais colt in Raron, trained by “Jim” Scobie,
was the medium of some big betting in the Flem-
ington Stakes, six furlongs, for two-year-olds. He
started at 3 to 1, with India’s Hope at s’s, Cyanate
and Raisuli at 6’s, Thracian at 7’s and the others
from B’s to 25’s. The race proved a good thing
for Cyanate, who won comfortably by a length
and a. quarter from Thracian (full brother to
Heroic), with Raisuli third. The winner, who had
run promisingly in the Gwyn Nursery on Caulfield
Cup Day, is by Cyklon—Arrasene. He is owned and
trained by Sid Ferguson and was ridden by Dempsey,
the time being lmin. 15sec.
T. M. Burke’s four-year-old gelding, The Slave,
who had run sixth in the Melbourne Cup, was
heavily backed for the V.R.C. Handicap, 1J miles,
winding up at 3 to 1. Frances Tressady was 4 to 1,
Rawhetu 7’s, Susie Pye and Stralia B’s, Accarak and
Our Prince 10’s, King’s Pardon and Great Wave
25’s. Rawhetu and King’s Pardon (a grey horse
from South Aus. who had shown up in the early
stages of the Cup) made the pace from the start.
With five furlongs to go, Rawhetu dropped back, but
Kings Pardon hung on well and was only beaten
by a neck by Our Prince, who finished stoutly, with
Stralia four lengths away third and Rawhetu
fourth. Frances Tressady, who has had too much
racing, seemed unable to go the pace set by King’s
Pardon and Rawhetu, and finished sixth, behind
The Slave. Our Prince was ridden by “Tich”
Wilson; he is trained by J. Bird for H. Lewis. The
time was 2min. 59sec.
* * * *
There were only six starters for the Victoria
Steeplechase, and Agricolo (lOst. lllb.), who had
won on Cup Day, was always favorite at 7 to 4
against. Jumping beautifully, he won as he liked
from Master Fife and Mandleman. A fair ’chaser is
worth following this season, when all the good ones
are out of the way. Agricolo ought to win again.
In accordance with custom, punters went for
a recovery on the Final Handicap, and nearly every-
thing was backed. Friarsdale finished up favorite
at 3to 1; Jimmie B was at 6’s, Prestongrange and
Prince Florizel at 7’s, and All Sunshine at B’s, with
double figures on offer about the others. Friarsdale tried
to lead all the way, and at the distance was fighting
it out with The Tyrant, but Arendal (15’s) came
with a great run and won by a head from Brunton’s
old gelding, with Friarsdale a close third. Arendal,
another of the conquering four-year-olds, is In - Bera-
goon—Humility, and is trained by F. Foulsham for
E. M. Pearce, owner of Red Shank.
In spite of Pilliewinkie’s triumphs at w.f.a.,
Windbag must be placed first among the horses com-
peting during the round. It was a sterling per-
formance for a four-year-old with 9st. 21b. to beat
a really first-class three-year-old, conceding 221 b., in
a two-miler run in 3min. 22Jsee., after the pair
had left the field five furlongs from home; Manfred
would have won four Cups out of five. The Night
Patrol proved the fastest miler in the Linlithgow
Stakes, but neither Windbag nor Manfred started,
and Whittier was not quite in his Caulfield Cup form.
Pantheon ran some good races, and is sure to do
well when further acclimatised. And just as Man-
fred stood out from the three-year-olds, so did
Rampion from the youngsters, though it is doubtful
■whether the Rossendale colt will furnish into a
stayer as thorough as the Valais chestnut has proved.
Of the jockeys, Young and Dempsey each rode three
winners. But followers of Duncan, so successful at
Caulfield, had a bad meeting—-they didn’t collect once.
“Tlie Oldest Inhabitant”: I did not see
Windbag’s race, but I saw Archer win the first Mel-
bourne Cup in 1861. The owner was Ettie de Mestre,
a Sydneysider, and he did it again with Archer in
’62, with Tim Whiffler in ’67, and with Oalamia in
’7B. Two years previous to the first Cup I saw
W. C. Yuille’s Flying Buck, trained by H. Yeend
and ridden bv his son, win the first Champion Stakes,
now no more. The lad Yeend was introduced to
Governor Henry Barkly, who presented him with his
BEYOND HER.
GEORGE: “I say, darling, what did I go round in this morning—186 or 187?"
MAUDE: “ Afraid I don't know, dearest. I was your caddie, reinembah —not an adding-
machine."
purse; what it contained was not disclosed. The
mare Zoe, second to Flying Buck, won the two fol-
lowing Champions. Flemington grandstand then was on
the river side, the hill being free to the public.
Flying Buck ended his days in the shafts of a
hansom-cab.
“Tenakolie” ; Pilliewinkie’s fine attempt to win the
Cup recalls that Martini-Henry was the first horse
from Maoriland to butt into Australian Derby and
Cup arguments; he won both V.R.C. Derby and
Cup in 1883. In the two-miler he carried 7st. 51b.,
and beat 28 others in the then record time of 3min.
304 sec. His 2min. 39sec. was also a record-, up to
then, for the Derby. During that race, Williamson,
the colt’s jockey, asked the lad on a tiring horse to
pull out and let him through. “You be blowed!”
was the reply; “I’ve got a chance yet.” “All right;
I’ll go round you and then win in 39,” said William-
son ; and that is just what he did. James White
bought the son of Musket and Sylvia from the
Auckland Stud Co. for 1250 guineas, a great price in
those days. On Cup morning a cable from White
arrived for Tom Morrin, chairman of directors of
the A. S. Co. I met a clerk of the Morrin iron-
mongery firm, as he was rushing round Auckland,
with the open cablegram in his hand, looking for
“our Mr. Thomas,” and was allowed to have a
peep. “We start; we win,” it read. I had another
two quid on at 8 to 1.
“Rounds”: Recollection of the fact that his mother
died the year Warrior won the Cup (1869)
helped the application of a Fitzroy (Vic.) man of
65 for the old-age pension. Like many another, he
had understated his age to fit himself into a job
that Was going when he arrived in the State, but
being hard-up in the sunset of life, he desired to
stand by the raw fact. Unfortunately the little
evidence he could produce suggested that he was
62. The inquiring commissioner, impressed by the
man’s earnestness, tried to stir his memory for some
corroboration of his assertion that he was 65, and
then came the remembrance of Warrior’s win. A
search of the death-registration returns for ’69 re-
vealed the certificate relative to the applicant’s
mother, and on it were details of the birth of her
children, applicant included. So the pension was
granted.
* * * *
Tooltarby (Bst. 01b.) was thought to have
such a mortgage on the Williamstown Cup, now a
£2500 affair, that the betting for a time was
10 to 1 bar the Sea Prince gelding. However The
Tyrant (7st. 81b.), who had run two good seconds
at Flemington, -was backed to B’s, while Tookarby
remained at 3’s; of the others, Lemina was at 10’s,
and King’s Pardon at 12’s. The last-named and
Manacre (33’s) were in front early, with The Tyrant
always handy. The Tyrant took charge half a mile
from home, and, staying better than The Slave, who
tackled him in the straight, beat T. M. Burke’s
gelding by three-quarters of a length, with Tookarby
a fair third and Our Prince fourth. The Tyrant
(Polycrates—Averse), whose first win it was for two
year’s, is trained by Dick Bradfield for Stuart Brun-
ton, and was ridden by H. Jones. His time for the
12 furlongs (2min. 31jsec.) was capital, but Wil-
liamstown is a fast course.
* * * *
The judge at Moorefield (N.S.W.) was
slow in putting up the result of the Moorefield
Handicap, 10 furlongs, on Saturday, and then he
hoisted Polynesian’s number above Auction’s. Many
people thought it was the other way about; never-
theless the man in the box occupies the best position
and what he says goes. Polynesian was favorite at
3’s, Auction was at 6’s, and old Piratic, who helped
to make the finish exciting, was a rank outsider.
Moisha (4’s), backed late (but not too late) for
the second division of a six-furlong handicap, put in
a surprising run in the short straight, after looking
hopelessly out of it at three furlongs, and won
handily from Royal Embrace and Gun of the North.
A sturdily-built four-year-old bay gelding by Bowman
—Staylace, Moisha has shown decent form over a
middle distance, and, all going well with him, will
be prominent in very much better races than Moore-
field sprints. R. W. Mackinnon, the Kogarah trainer,
was represented by three winners—Prairie Belle
(20’s) in the Flying Handicap, Cave Dweller (2’s)
in another sprint, and Bos worth Field (5 to 2) in
the Welter Mile. The last-named, who is owned by
the Macarthur Onslows, is one of the handsomest
horses in training, but he is not as good as he looks.
* * * *
In Queensland, as elsewhere, four-year-
olds have done wonderfully well this year. A case
in point is E. J. Bedgood’s black gelding Fine
Stitch (Featherstitch- —Exertion), who, having walked
away with the Albion “Thousand” on October 27,
won the Brisbane Handicap almost as easily on
Saturday at the Q.T.C.’s Spring meeting. The
Sydney horse Hit, who was receiving 81b. from
Fine Stitch, was a warm favorite, but third was
the best he could do, Persse’s Double separating
him from Fine Stitch, who started at s’s. As in
the “Thousand,” the black flier was ridden by Tucker.
Another Sydney horse in Stony was well backed for
the Spring Stakes, w.f.a., as also was Admetus, a
recent visitor to Randwick, but neither was equal
to getting a place, Tabragalba (2’s) winning as he
liked from Lady Shepherd and Polardee. But for
the accident he met with at Randwick, Sum King
would probably have had an easy task in the
Q.T.C. Derby. In the Comedy King colt’s absence,
Wee Glen, who is by Bernard—Glen Iris, was an
easy first, Piastoon and Lord Redfern following
him home.
“Ascot”: If Queensland bookmakers don’t get rich
quick, it is not because they stretch the odds. The
Banana land tote is the greediest betting machine in
the world (worse eve'll than the N.S.W. tote), yet
it lays longer odds than Ikey Mo. The tote takes
a straight-out deduction of 13J p.c. of receipts, and
unpaid fractional money and unclaimed dividends
increase the rake-off to 154 p.c. The bookie pays
only a trifling tax, yet he makes a bad showing
alongside the machine. The Albion “Thousand”
winner, Fine Stitch, started at 5 to 4 (never better
than 6 to 4 on the day) ; the tote paid a trifle
under 5 to 4, and there were two other dividends.
In race after race the same thing happens.
On the Parramatta last Saturday sculler
Jim Paddon, now in his 40th year but still a
splendid specimen of muscular manhood, tried to
regain his world’s title from the greatly improved
Goodsell, but found the handicap of 14 years too
great. The ageing giant led for a time, but just
before the mile (clocked in 6min. 35sec.) Goodsell
went to the front, and stayed there. Paddon was
game, and just when he seemed dead beat he came
to light with a great finishing spurt, but the
younger man got there by a length and a half,
completing the 3 miles 330 yards in 22min. 50sec.
-—good time, for the water was choppy and there
was a head wind. Goodsell fell but of his boat in
his previous match with Paddon; he became cham-
pion, after Paddon’s retirement, by defeating
McDevitt. Tom Saul (Macleay River) has a deposit
up for a match with Goodsell; and Hadfield and
Hannan (M.L.) and Bert Barry and J. Tonks (Eng.)
are threatening challenges. But Goodsell may go to
America.

The American “Tiger” Payne (list. 61b.)
is more black than striped, but he looked fierce
enough as he shaped up to Alf Stewart (list. 81b.)
at the Melbourne Stadium. If, like missionaries, the
gods have soft hearts for niggers, they must have
shed tears at the subsequent proceedings, for “Tiger”
was merely a punching-bag for the Victorian pug.
After being severely knocked about, he had the towel
thrown in by his seconds in the fourteenth round.
The nigger has a good punch, but he is a poor shot
with it. He is also inclined to butt, but Stewart
never complained; as the butting enabled him to
land some really good hits, he had no cause.
Tommy Milton, Bill Grime’s Melbourne
discovery, bit off more than he could chew when
he tackled Ignacio Fernandez, a bronzed statue en-
dowed with life and horse-kick punches, at the
Sydney Stadium. The Filipino scaled Bst. 841 b.
and the Victoria was 241 b. heavier. Milton is a
game and fairly clever lad, but he had never, in his
all-too-short experience, met a youth of such calibre,
self-confidence and hitting power as Fernandez, and
after the first couple of rounds it was clear that
the Filipino was his master. The referee stopped it
in the eighth, after Tommy had taken a fearful
hiding with great grit.
* * * *
“H. Hardupp” : George Cook, the Dubbo
(N.S.W.) heavyweight, must be cleaning up a fair
pile in America, for his ex-manager, who is suing
him for breach of contract, claims that he is en-
titled to 33 per cent, of the boxer’s winnings, and
specifies £lO,OOO. The ex-manager is Charles
Lucas, who once handled the affairs of the West-
ralian abo. middleweight “Black Paddy,” and
subsequently looked after “Digger” Evans. Lucas
and Evans were in the A.1.F., and when the war
finished they got in touch with the Horseferry-road
functionary who was in charge of “the Billy Hughes
stunt,” that eminent statesman having invited Dig-
gers to confide their grievances and ambitions to
him. A letter went forward to the A.I.F. kit-store
at Hammersmith to the effect that the Prime Min-
ister was interested in “Digger’s” plans for bash-
ing the British bantams, and an obliging official pro-
vided Evans and Lucas with training quarters in
the store. The interesting pair subsequently male
the obliging one’s life a burden with fresh demands,
having no modest ideas of their own importance.
I don’t know if the official ever had a heart-to-heart
talk with Hughes ; if so Billy must have been pro-
foundly astonished to hear that he was responsible
for putting “Digger” Evans on the track to his
boxing career.
Held at the Fitzroy Oval to admit of a
wicket being prepared at the Melbourne O. G.—
which had hard usage during the football season—for
coming big matches, the Westralia-Vic. game caused
very little public interest. There would have been
more if the Vic. selectors had given a few promising
colts a trial, but the Westralians, it seems, are
anxious to meet the best inter-State elevens so that
their youngsters may gain experience. The Sand-
gropers opened well enough, the board showing 1 for
88, but a procession began after the 19-year-old Drew,
who batted very solidly for 42, lost his wicket, a.nd
it was checked only by a spirited 16 from Inverarity.
This very promising lad afterwards took six Victorian
wickets for 162. Renfrey. whose bright 29 n.o. in-
cluded a sixer, Quinlan (37) and Rowe, the captain,
were other Westralian batsmen who impressed—
Rowe contributed a plucky 55 (more than half the
total) in the second innings. The Victorians’ batting
was not very thrilling-—it rarely is—but Ponsford
(158) added to his remarkable list of centuries in
inter-State matches, and H. S. Love (103) and
Willis (79) contributed materially to the total of
536. The Westralians’ ground fielding was very fine.
They were beaten by an innings and 283, but Inver-
arity, at least, will be heard of again. The match
was practically a St. Hilda victory, Ponsford and
Love scoring 261 of the runs, while Blackie (4 for
64) and Ironmonger (9 for 54) got most of the
wickets ; but the weakened St. Hilda team, playing
in the pennant competition against North Melbourne,
showed that it still had talent left. With the aid
of Levin (184) and Ellis (153) it scored 394
runs in response to North Melbourne’s 78.
* * * *
“Gobble” : Most of the luck in Melbourne
pennant cricket goes to Carlton. Last season that
team got the points for two matches it didn’t win.
In the first, Hendry played for Melbourne before he
had received permission from the Association; in
the other, Jack Ryder, by taking part in the first
Saturday of a pennant game for Collingwood, broke
the rule that makes a player ineligible when he has
been picked for a Test (Jack made 148 for the
Magpies and 201, 0, and 88 for Australia). This
year Carlton’s luck sticks. With 14 minutes to bat,
Richmond wanted seven runs to win. Then the
umpires, acting under an instruction of the V.C.A.,
drew the stumps because there was no time to
complete a new over.
* * * *
The English bowlers had a great week in
Adelaide, and expressed themselves astonished at
the personal touch of friendliness which went beyond
and behind the numerous official welcomes. They
played three matches against S.A. ; one at
Prospect, which club holds the local premiership;
one at Glenelg, a historic spot; and one at Toorak,
admittedly the finest green in or about Adelaide.
The visitors were badly beaten every time, but
will probably do better later on. They do not
even know yet what their best team is, the players
having in few cases met before they gathered on
the boat. They are a genial crowd, from various
parts of Britain, though mainly Scotch, have a
lot of ladies with them, and have devised a rousing
war-song based on the old “Men of Harlech.’'
THE PRO’S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Sir , the 1924 amateur golf champion, is
affianced to a daughter of the late Mr. , of
Sydney. They met when golfing.” —Cable , Daily
Mail, Brisbane.
He spoke to me, that angry man;
A noted “pro.” was he,
Whose “walk in life” since life began
Had led from tee to tee,
Whose every word and thought still ran
On golf as golf should be.
And sore he moaned and sad he spoke,
As one whose ecstasy
Of grief may any moment choke
The words now tumbling free;
“ ’E was,” he said, “the smartest bloke
That ever come to me.
“I coached ’im till I made a champ,
And ’twasn’t for the fee,”
He muttered, and his brow was damp
With bitter agony ;
“And then along comes this ’ere vamp.
And runs ’im up a tree.
“I’d taught ’im every trick I knew,
And that’s not two or three,
Of grip and stance and follow-through,”
And then —how mournfully
The words escaped him—“mighty few
Approach like ’im,” said he.
“I thought ’e ’ad the sort o’ soul
Above such frippery ;
I would’ve done a tidy roll
Upon ’is sanity ;
I’d warned ’im what a tricky ’ole
That thirteenth was, you see.
“And now they’ve got the blooming gall
To blame it on to me,
And say ’e’d not been taught at all.
The golfer’s ABC—
To keep ’is eye upon the ball
And not to bend ’is knee!”
QUEENSLAND.

THE INKY WAY.
“Ces”; The real reason why Melbourne newsagents
decline to handle the new daily is that the com.
on a penny rag is less than on a three-ha’penny rag ;
and they are afraid that if they push the Morning
Post the other papers will also drop to the copper.
And that would mean a 50 per cent, shrinkage in
newsagencies’ commission.
“Papi”; A girl who has made her mark in Eng-
lish journalism is Miss Isitt, the original “Dominica”
of Wellington Dominion (M.L.). The Manchester
Guardian owns her now. Several women from the
Shivery Isles have entered the English short-story and
novel market, but I believe this is the only case of a
Maoriland girl making good in English journalism.
“Jim G.”: A Digger friend of mine sent some
verses to The Bulletin. In the “Answers to Corres-
pondents” they told him: “As dull as a dead fish
falling on a marble slab.” He took it in the right
spirit, even going into a Dago’s shop and banging
a fish down on the slab in order, he said, to find
out what kind of a poet he really was.
The Molong (N.S.W.) Express was established in
1876, just on half a century ago, by Henry Vale
Letham, who died three years later, and was buried
on the banks of Bell River or Molong Creek. His
widow carried on the badness during her lifetime,
and to-day the paper is conducted by the founder’s
sons. The half-century in one family seems to be a
record for a Western N.S.W. paper.
“T. 0.1.”: Re John Norton’s idolatry of Napoleon
(B. 22/10/’25). He had a colossal bust of Nap on
the table in his own room in King-street, Sydney.
It was always covered with a sheet. On one occasion
a suspicious character arrived by appointment to
communicate some important information to the
newspaper proprietor. Before he would open his
mouth, however, lie insisted on uncovering the bust
to satisfy himself that no listener-in or spy was
concealed beneath the sheet.
“Hargo”: Wolaroi, a fine mansion on the outskirts
of Orange (N.S.W.), has passed into the hands of
the Methodist's, who will make it a college for boys.
A local newspaper reported the other day that the
new owners had applied to the local council for
permission to instal a “sceptic” tank; but the
authorities disclaim any sinister designs against un-
believers. This mansion, by the way, built about 40
years ago, cost the late J. C. McLachlan £17,000;
the Methodists acquired it for less than £6oooi
Lord Burnham was introduced to many things in
Australia, among them the thimble and pea. It
happened after midnight at Waikerie (S.A.) during
the visit of the press party to the Murray irrigation
areas. Paddy Kearns, who keeps the Waikerie pub,
is known far and wide as a sleight-of-hand expert,
and he was brought in to entertain his distinguished,
guests. Burnham’s many tries to pick the pea failed,
Nor did Major Astor detect any flaw in the £1
notes which Paddy pulled out of the atmosphere,
though the gallant soldier solemnly checked one of
his own notes with the supposed imitation.
“Huffin-Guffin”: “Lomara” (B. 22/10/’25), when
writing of the Essendon Gazette and the Mott
family's connection therewith, missed an interesting
point. Mott, senior, was part-owner of the Hamilton
(Vic.) Spectator in the ’seventies when J. E.
Archibald contributed to it his first paragraph. The
par. was about a military funeral at Warrnambool,
and contained Archibald’s pun about the corps
creating more interest than the corpse. In writing
his memoirs, Archibald acknowledged that he still
thought his pun a good one, and added another in
honor of Mott for printing it —-“Bon Mott!”
“T.R.H.”: The late John Norton was not the
only journalist affected with the Napoleonic craze.
When I was on the London Daily Mail, Northeliffe
(then Sir Alfred Harmsworth) fancied the same
resemblance between himself and Nap. He had a
Napoleon room filled with statues, and he used
to retire to this sanctum when the fit of paranoia
was on him. It was at such times he would sack
everyone he met in Carmelite House, from Lincoln
Springfield to the junior office boy. Nobody took
any notice of these dismissals, as there was always
a buffer. between Harmsworth’s eccentricity and the
staff in the person of dear old Tom Marlowe.
“H.H.”: The new Melbourne paper, the Morning
Post, scored so well during its first three days that
a hurried meeting of circulation managers of the
other papers was held to consider their campaign-
ing plans. There have been skirmishes which are
likely to give occupation to the police courts. Most
of them have been between boys selling the old
three-ha’penny papers, who object to intrusion on
their ground, and the sellers of the penny invader;
but in one the principals were a member of the
Post staff and a suburban newsagent who had sooled
three boys on to one Post seller. A brisk and
exciting time is likely to prevail until the people
who object to the newcomer realise that to help it
to advertisement is about the worst policy they
could adopt.
“R.D.”: It is all very well for Robert 11. Davis,
of Munsey’s, to tell Australian writers that they
ought to write about their own little circle in their
own little corner of their own big continent. Many
of them have done this, but an American magazine
is the last place to which they would think of
sending the result. I have had a pretty lengthy
experience of writing for these same magazines, and
have published many stories set in South America,
U.S.A., the Islands and the high seas. But when
I tried to edge in an occasional story set in the
country I knew something about; the wicket became
suddenly sticky. It would have been all right, I was
told definitely, if the story hadn’t dealt with Aus-
tralia, “a country in which we find it impossible
to interest our readers.” Why, I was assured by
Paul Reynolds, the New York agent, that magazine-
editors wouldn’t even look at a quiet, true-to-life
story of their own Texas. They want to believe
that this plain, prosaic Ford-car sort of territory
is a playground for sportive cattle-thieves and
sheriffs with cast-iron jowls. And what orgies of
unreal romanticism would they demand of Australia,
if it ever came within the range of their editorial
vision ?
“Wart”: Can’t something be done for the free-
lance?” asks “Fed-up” (B. 22/10/’25). He com-
plains of the poor payment offered for stories after
they are published. I have been bitten the same
way. Four times now I have received 255. each
for short stories which went nearly 2000 words. The
worst case was that of a Sydney monthly. I sent
a short story of nearly 4000 words. In a covering
letter I said I wouldn’t accept less than A.J.A.
rates. About two months later I saw my story in
print. I wrote requesting payment and referred to
my covering letter. Nothing happened. A month
later I sent a demand for £6 6s. Still nothing
happened. Then I asked a lawyer to collect for me.
He promptly received a cheque for £4, and a
letter stating that there wasn’t any standard payment.
The lawyer advised me to accept.
“Ricardo”: Members of the A.J.A. employed on the
papers that specialise in sensations are discussing
a proposal to claim increased rates for “extra-
hazardous” service. A stunt journalist has to be
prepared at a moment’s notice to go up in ari
aei’oplane or down in a diver’s dress, interview
notorious criminals and beard wild Bolsheviks in
their lairs. My own experiences include an un-
friendly call by “Squizzy” Taylor, visits from rival
gangsters in the Fitzroy vendetta, innumerable blood-
curdling threats and one actual assault.
“Kaitangata Ika”: Whenever Hugh Denison reads
this notice in London Sunday Times he turns the
color of green tobacco leaf: “The charge for Society
Announcements on this page is three guineas for
five lines and 12s. 6d. for each line after. A
line contains about seven words.” Needless to say
the paper’s society page is not cluttered up with
announcements of the engagement of Bill, the butcher
boy, to Maud, the cobbler’s daughter, and the marriage
of Two-up Tom to Kitty Collarstud, the sorter at
Rippem’s laundry.

A wealthy young married man, who has
reached the conclusion that all matrimony
outside Heaven and the pictures must needs
be unsatisfactory, carries complacency to the
limits of idiocy until urged by interfering
relatives that the scandal of his wife’s be-
havior must be terminated by an arranged
divorce. The final straw is the wife’s fail-
ure to return home—a motor-car breakdown
and a night spent at a hotel with her escort
are incidental —after flirting outrageously at
a ball. Egged on by the relatives, Archie
Cobb (his front name gives the play its
title) raves rather unconvincingly at his
wife, who, suddenly convinced that he is
not the amiable, jelly-fish character she has
imagined, welcomes him to her heart as her
“cave-man.” The allowance he receives from
his uncle, however, depends upon the divorce,
and, arrangements having been made with a
widow who is prepared to suffer scandal for
a fee, a pink pyjama coat, intended to asso-
ciate Archie with an intrigue, is placed in
the lady’s room in the Warbeek Hydro, where
he and his relatives have gone to prepare
the stage for the knot-sundering. Complica-
tions follow when Billie Cobb, his wife,
pursues him with declarations of her newly-
awakened love, and he repudiates the plot;
and matters are made very uncomfortable
for Archie’s male relatives and friends when
it turns out that, whilst they all wear pink
pyjamas, Archie has always clung to the
old-fashioned nightshirt. On this sketchy
story, with an interwoven romance between
Susie Tressinger (Elsie Prince) and Toby
Kerwyn (Charlton Morton), three hours of
entertainment considerably below the “No,
No, Nanette” standard, but well enough sup-
plied with catchy melodies, dances and gay
dresses, leads up to the usual happy con-
clusion. The humor and dialogue are often
painfully cheap, but the show is swift-moving
and clean.
* » *• *
Although all the members of the show
laughed through their misfortunes and mis-
understandings as if they were good jokes,
the bulk of the comedy fell upon Jimmy
Godden, as Archie Cobb, who sang “I Know
All About Girls,” incidentally kissdng 16
of them, and May Beatty (Lady Violet),
whose description of Archie’s wife includes a
declaration that she likes even her onions
scented. George Jennings (who was under-
study to Alfred Frith and has just joined
up with Hugh Ward) did very well as
Archie’s woman-hating uncle, Sir Michael
Connynhame; and Polly Power, the under-
study of Elsie Prince, brightly justified her
promotion to two parts of her own. The
others were generally satisfactory, although
Oliver McLennon (Geoffrey Parkes) was
stiff and seemed flat in his first number,
“Put on the Ritz.” Of several dances, one
by Constance Evans deserves special men-
tion. Many of the others were more like
marches, but they were effectively arranged.
The show should keep the New Princess
Theatre (Melb.), where it opened on Satur-
day, well dusted till the panto, arrives at
Christmas.

Some delightful Jacobean furniture
dressed the stage when “Peg o’ My Heart”
was revived at Melbourne King’s on Satur-
day ; but the performance did not live up
to the stage-setting. Nellie Bramley, fail-
ing to catch the best qualities of’ Peg, in-
troduced much Yankee slang unmodified by
the sweetness of any recognisable Irish
brogue, and was merely so boisterous that
one could not be surprised at the Chicliest-
ers thinking their £lOOO a year very well
earned for keeping her under their roof. Alto-
gether the company was not happily cast,
although Carl Lawson did well as Lawson,
the Chichestea-s’ butler; Arthur Cornell,
with the feebleness of age in his voice—
rather overdone for the comfort of the audi-
ence —was a reasonably good Montgomery
Hawkes, the solicitor ; Beryl Barraclough was
bright in the small part of the maid, Ben-
nett; and Sylvia McNair adequate as Mrs.
Chichester. The frequent laughter of the
gay-hearted lover Jerry (George Hewlett)
was so obviously forced that it conveyed the
uncomfortable feeling that, at bottom, he
might be as thorough a villain as the melo-
dramatic Guy Hastings, who was Christian
Brent; and as Alaric Chichester John Gal-
way missed a lot of the laughs that should
have come.
* =:< *
A prologue spoken by two ladies in flowing
garments (Alice Crowther and Beatrice Ter-
nan) as an introduction to each of a string
of six episodes divided by painfully long
intervals indicated that John Drinkwater’s
purpose in “Abraham Lincoln” is to show
how circumstance and responsibility mould
a character, and how in turn one man’s
character may mould millions. The Mel-
bourne Repertory staged the difficult drama
at the Playhouse; and an ovation was given
to Helton Daniell at its conclusion. The first
scene shows Abraham Lincoln in his house
at Springfield, awaiting and receiving the
deputation which is to ask him to stand for
President. He is a sufferer from earnest
convictions, but to some extent his character
is amorphous, and it is his dominating wife
(Edith Bell) whose hand is at the wheel
of the ship of his fortunes. The subsequent
incidents show strength and resolution de-
veloping as he crushes in his Cabinet the
desire for compromise with the rebellious
South, faces the griefs of a war his soul
hates but tells him is necessary, takes the
entire responsibility for the proclamation of
the abolition of slavery when his Cabinet
fears to march so far with him, and finally
wins through to victory and public acclama-
tion, to be assassinated when at the zenith
of his power; and through it all the kindli-
ness of his nature gleams constantly, even in
the hours of the greatest stress.
* * * *
The audience was generous in its judgments.
Considering the difficulty of handling a large
cast of about 50 characters in a sketchy, episo-
dal play which would require a revolving stage
to avoid long intervals, the Players did quite
well, even though they fell short, of Drink-
water’s objectives. The big responsibility
fell upon Helton Daniell, who failed to
catch entirely the spirit of Abraham Lin-
coln ; yet the failure was heroic. Among the
subsidiary characters who showed merit were
Charles Row, with a conscientious character-
isation of Secretary of State William
Seward ; Stanley Smith, as Frederick Douglas,
the negro parson; Robert Ogg, as Mont-
gomery Blair; Ray Whiting, as Mr. Stone;
Robert Guthrie as Mr. Cuffney, and Graham
Poock as Burnet Hook. The women were
uniformly good; Edith Appleton, as Susan
Deddington, and Ceridwen Kelly, a very
capable natural actress who would be im-
proved for a little more control, as Mrs.
Otherley, being the best. But a man whose
determination to do a dirty deed was as pal-
pable as George Faulkner made John Wilkes
Booth’s should have been held up before he
passed the box-office, in which case, of
course, Abraham Lincoln would have been
saved a gory end.

The present generation has had no oppor-
tunities of viewing the mirthful “Are You a
Mason?” and it is a pity the Frank Neil
Co., which staged it at the New Palace

it necessary to load it with a fresh cargo of

and should let the light into his foregrounds more;
but his distances are interesting. He looks through
gum-trees at the sun very enchantingly, and arranges
his skies to suit his landscapes, as a good composer
must. The showery morning at Newport (No. 23)
is as nice as any. The foreground tree, the cliff

a natural rhythm that says ocean winds and several

Norman Carter is strong but unbeautiful—delib-

well known in Adelaide, has a charming study o-
winter sunlight. Ure Smith, who, like Lionel
Lindsay, has a few' sound etchings in the show,

HE looks admiringly down at his “Valet” Razor. It’s hard
for a man to say in a few words just what he thinks of a
razor that has done its duty so truly and well for years and years.
Regularly every morning without letting up for a single instant
he gets a smooth, velvety shave from a blade that strops itself
—a delightful lancet-like edge that only a “Valet” can provide.
The principle is the same no matter how much you pay for your
“Valet” set —ten seconds to strop, a perfect shave from a blade
that can be used over and over again for weeks and weeks, and
then ten seconds to clean. There is no taking the blade out and
no fiddling about with screws.

*£Y APPOINTMENT TO
H.M. THE KING
The 19/60-H.P. CROSSLEY
THE 19/60-h.p. Crossley has probably
attracted more attention than any other
car iii its class. Certainly it possesses a
very enviable reputation for all-round efficiency
and sweetness of running, and is recognised as
being a delightful car to handle. From five
miles per hour on top gear it can be rapidly
accelerated to sixty. Everything about the car
speaks of quality, and its road performance
satisfies the most exacting.
Further, the fact that the 19/60-h.p. Cross-
ley broke all R.A.C. Certified Trial Car Mileage
Records when it completed 25,000 miles under
the observation of the Royal Automobile Club
supplies ample and conclusive proof of extra-
ordinary reliability. No other car has ever
approached this distance under official observa-
tion. The Crossley completed 25,000 miles with'
only 3| minutes spent on adjustments or repairs
on the road, and at a total cost we have calcu -
lated to be I jd. per mile for oil, fuel and tyres.
Full details of this achievement gladly supplied
on application.
It must be emphasised that the 19/60-h.p
Crossley is a car far above the ordinary, with
all the refinements which appeal tq the experi-
enced motorist. Built from the finest material
obtainable and with scrupulous care, it is a car
which can be purchased with confidence, and
which will live up to the splendid reputation ?t
has gained in every part of the world. Petyrol
consumption results are better than those of tiny
other car of similar capacity.
The 19/60-h.p. Crossiey was the first
British car to run from Adelaide to Darwin and
back under its own power. The car used, had
previously run over 30,000 miles.
There are numerous 19/60-h.p. Crosslf ys on
the road to-day which have already completed
over 150,000 miles, and are still runuring as
sweetly as ever.

Poverty
Point
“W.J.P.F.” : Alfred Dumpier used to say
that one of the two most artistic things
he could remember seeing on the stage was
Charles Kenningliam’s business at the end of
the kitchen scene in “Twelfth Night.” Ken-
ningham’s ability as a composer has been
mentioned (B. 5/11/’25). “My Colleen
Oge Astliore” was, I think, his most beauti-
ful air. He composed the music for the
ode “Australia” sung at the inauguration
of the Commonwealth Parliament in 1901
by Nellie Stewart.
“C.K.” (poor Kenningham’s last para-
graph! : It has always been surprising to
me that so many prominent vocalists have
neglected the art of sight-reading. Instru-
mentalists also. Once in England, noting
that a Doctor of Music was to be the accom-
panist at a concert at which I was to sing.
I sent in a programme worthy, I thought, of
the gentleman’s rank. To my astonishment he
could not play the numbers, and had to spend
many hours in working them up. Even then
he only managed to struggle through. In
another instance the holder of a most im-
portant position in an Australian university
failed in attempting to play “Chin, Chin,
Chinaman,” from “The Geisha.” He ex-
plained his non-success by stating that he was
an abstract musician,whatever that may be. I
have known professional players and teachers
with strings of letters after their names who
could not be trusted to read an ordinary
hymn tune, and to whom a simple transposi-
tion would be impossible. One lady of this
class could not play “God Save the King”
in any other key but B flat unless it was
written down for her, and time allowed for
practice.
“F.S.”: By July Australian audiences
will be listening to the world’s greatest
basso, Fedor Ivanovitch Chaliapine, of
Kazan, Russia, with whom the Taits have
just signed a contract for 25 concerts. After
being shoemaker’s apprentice, railway porter
and stevedore, at 17 he joined a Russian
travelling company as singer and dancer,
and he was 35 before he was heard outside
his own country. Thomas Beeeham, the
pillmaker’s son. introduced his extraor-
dinarily silky voice to London in a season
of Russian opera at Drury-lane in 1913,
but the war years found him at home.
British officialdom saw in his alleged Red
leanings a menace to the State, and opposed
his landing in 1921 to fulfil his first post-
war engagement at the Albert Hall, but
the music-lovers won, and gave him the
warmest reception of his life. Chaliapine
is that rare bird, a domesticated virtuoso,
and Mrs. Chaliapine and four Chaliapino-
vitches are coming with him.
“Goldilocks”: A trip abroad and other
marks of confidence have come the way of
Percy Crawford, owing to the Tivoli man-
agement’s desire to get fewer weeds in the
vaudeville garden, too many of them having
been wished on to it recently. And it is
not only a matter of weeds, either; some
quite good turns fail to hit the taste of
Tivoli audiences. Crawford, who has
managing the Melbourne Tivoli and has had
a rough spin with some alleged stars who
declined to alter turns which would not go
down with the Australian public, has grown
up in the front-of-the-house part of the busi-
ness, and ought to be able to select acts that
will suit.
“Hamfat”: Grace Savieri, who was en-
gaged to play lead in the Island pictures
which Frank Hurley is making for the
Oswald Stoll firm, has had the bad luck to
contract malaria. Grace figured in a Wil-
liamson panto, a few years ago—her first
metropolitan appearance—and had a small
part in “The Peep Show.” A slight lisp is
a disadvantage in spoken comedy; but she is
well qualified for movie work, as she showed
in “The Mystery of a Hansom Cab.” The
young Australian has had a life-long
acquaintance with the stage; when a baby
she slept in a basket in her mother’s dress-
ing-room. Ma is Miss Betterton Glover,
now with Neil’s co. at the Melbourne New
Palace; and Dad, Pete Savieri, is a com-
edian with a long record of service with the
Phillip Lytton cos.
“Caul-boy” : Many producers besides G. B.
Post (B. 5/11/’25) are casual about details
that could be put right by inquiring down
the street. Muriel Starr staged “East of
Suez” in Sydney with genuine Chinese ideo-
graphs on the temple-scrolls, but when “Mr.
Wu” was first put on in London, although
Whitechapel was round the corner the scrib-
blings that did duty for Celestial inscrip-
tions would have made a Pekingese pug
laugh.
“T.P.”: Edna Thomas, singing her negro
spirituals at Sale (Vic.) on tne sultriest
night of a steamy week, was distressed by
the multitude of winged insects which left
the darkened hall for the lit stage. Charac-
teristically, she took the audience into her
confidence. “Pardon me if I seem to be
moving about a lot,” she said, “but the bugs
up here are worrying me.” When the audi-
ence rocked with merriment she looked sur-
SUCCESS AHEAD—WELL AHEAD.
MRS. DRAMAH: “Oh, Teddy, you haven't told me what old Gubbins said about those
three plays you submitted to him!"
MR. DRAMAH: “Splendid! He prophesied they would be performed when Shakspeare's
arc forgotten."
prised. “My pianiste,” Edna broke out later,
“has just whispered to me that you don’t
call ’em bugs like we do in Louisiana.
Whatever you call them, they are keeping
me busy.”
“Hasen”: There is little originality and
less truth in most movie advertisements.
Hence I found the recent announcement of
a Brisbane picture-theatre wonderfully re-
freshing. It described the “comic” as
“heart-rending.”
“F.N.W.”: The managerial mind is hard
to understand. Patrons are lured into
temples of Thespis by expensive advertising,
and are greeted on the doormat by well-
nourished managers with silk hats and
cigqrs. A cheery air pervades the brilliantly-
lighted vestibule, and as the visitor treads
the carpeted floor leading into the theatre he
really begins to regard himself as a guest,
in spite of the painful formality of the box-
offiee. After the show, however, the audi-
ence emerges into dark, narrow and tortuous
alleys. Feeling awkwardly for the doorstep,
it gropes blindly into some dismal back-
street. Grumpy attendants shout “Hurry
along,” and dust-sheets are ostentatiously
spread over seats in which the young female
of the species has sat entranced. In short.
the mask of the theatre is snatched off pre-
maturely. The management rudely dispels"
the illusions which it sets out to create.
“Imogen”: “The Mandarin Coat” has
brought Isabel Handley into the limelight,
but another work from her pen is frequently
played in Melbourne. It is a comedy so
extravagant in parts as to be classed as farce.
Entitled “The Six Miss Seymours,” it deals
with the attempts of exiled spinsters weary
of country life to get back to the bright
lights by marrying a townie, and shows dis-
tinct skill in type-drawing and flapper-
dialogue. Requiring only one man player to
12 young women, it is a favorite with Old
Girls’ dramatic clubs.
"Flaming Youth” : Ray Longford’s "Rush-
whackers” has its good and bad points, like
the average Australian film. The photo-
graphy is first-class, and the acting—what
there is of it —is creditable ■ but the story is
an anaemic imported theme, only made Aus-
tralian by the fine scenery in the background.
Some of the incidents are too obviously
dragged in to introduce some very raw
comedy and the scenery, which appears to
be regarded as the most important ingredi-
ent ; while the “cut-ins” are pitifully crude,
largely a monotonous repetition of "A Week
Later,” “A Month Later,” “Six Months
Later,” and so on. Bill Lawson, a wharfie
out of work owing to a strike, leaves his
wife and child to go out into the country;
and, • the “cut-in” having remarked in a
vague way “Lawson Arrives in the Coun-
try,” the picture shows Bill entering a ter-
race house somewhere in Paddington or New-
town. Apparently it was considered unneces-
sary to take the people required for that
part of the production beyond the subbubs.
Later, when a man gets shot in the leg the
wound is bandaged in two flicks with what
looks more like tape than the real thing;
and the trouser-leg isn’t even siit up by the
person who examines the wound and fixes
the bandage. Maybe the destruction of a pair
of old pants was regarded as an unneces-
sary extravagance. Unfortunately Austra-
lian film producers need to cut expenses to
the bone to make the business pay; but such
pitiful economies heavily handicap them in
their struggle with Hollywood.
“Caesar's Ghost”: I’m glad to hear that
Knoblock is collaborating with Arnold Ben-
nett in the “Mr. Prohack” play (B.
29/10/’25), for Bennett is a dull and uncon-
vincing playwright. As a novelist he re-
calls Dickens, but he is a failure as a drama-
tist, and Dickens was, too. The latter’s best
play, “The Lamplighter,” Wgs a dreary thing.
“A Tale of Two Cities” has certainly been
nobly dramatised, but the job was done by
a deft craftsman in Tom Taylor. Dickens
would have botched it himself.
“Black Out”: Eileen Sparks, the New-
castle girl who is Jean Paurel’s first sweet-
heart in “The Great Lover,” has played a
greater variety of parts than any other
actress of her age in Australia. Jefferson
Taite gave her her first engagement when
she was only a child. He heard Eileen
read a part, and, taking it from her, said:
“That'll do. You begin with us to-night.”
She has rarely been out of work since.
“Hambone” : A Sydney broadcasting station
recently put on the air a six-act “mystery”
drama, of which one act was given each
week. Before the denouement came, listen-
ers were asked to give reasons for a certain
development in the mystery, with its solu-
tion. This new kind of hunt-the-slipper
proved popular. Letters were received from
935 wireless fans, and these contained 1300
solutions. Over 400 identified the central
figure in the incident. Half of these failed
to indicate the people responsible for a cer-
tain plight he was in, and only three scored
a hit as to the reason why he came to be
in the tight corner. A Crow's Nest (Sydney)
man was the nearest, and collared the first
prize-- a two-valve receiving set.
"Hambone”: 111-fated Max Linder was,
in my judgment, a better film-clown than
Charlie Chaplin. lie had more finesse, and
relied more on natural endowments and
less on eccentric dress. Max could tell a
story with a waggling ear or a shifty eye-
brow the true eloquence of the screen
funny man. Even at Charlie’s own game
of rawest slapstick the Frenchman could
hold his ovvn. One of the earliest efforts I
saw Max in was “The Smashing Waiter,”
which went for a hilarious two reels. That
was in 1907, and the place a poky little
mill m Hatte s Arcade, Newtown, Sydney,
-ibis and Thiels Pictures —an open-air
show —were then the only movie palaces in
the populous subbub. My first glimpse of
Max cost me 2d. A bloke could get some
change out of 3d. a week pocket-money in
those days!
R.K.D.N.”: Frederick Lonsdale’s newest
piece, though acted by a cast which includes
Gladys Cooper and Gerald du Maurier, dis-
appointed the critical fraternity on its first
flight at London St. James’s. But the “sauci-
-11 ess of the writing, especially in an enter-
taining and whimsical last act, seems to have
sent everyone home happy. A sample of the
dialogue quoted by one newspaper is cer-
tainly saucy, but hardly what one would call
high comedy, or worthy of Lonsdale’s repu-
tation : “Clothes make the man; but many a
bride is disappointed when they are taken
off.” That epigrammatic quality is beaten,
I think, by an ancient musical-comedy gag:
“The coat doesn’t make the man; it's the
trousers.”
“Philm Up”: What further outrages are
to be permitted to the “pitchers”? The
latest is a film version of “East Lynne,” in
which Little Willie is not a Roved to give
op the ghost, but lives on to assist in a
happy ending. What enjoyment can we get
out of the piece if we are not permitted to
snivel at the little cherub's decease? flow
shall we show our sympathy with the
anguished Madame Vine, who will no longer
cry, even in a sub-title, “Dead,, dead, and never
called me mother!”! Have these Yankee
producers no consideration for old playgoers’
feelings?
“L.TJ.D.” (Lond.) : Daly’s Theatre, where
some of the best specimens of musi-
cal comedy have been staged during a
long series of years, has struck a
vein of bad luck. Its latest produc-
tion, “Cleopatra,” was taken off after a
comparatively short season and the company
disbanded. The same management’s “Katja,
the Dancer,” which had been playing at the
Gaiety, was brought in to fill the gap. The
latter house will probably take to the pic-
tures till a play with music, written by
Oscar Asche, has been sufficiently rehearsed.
It is called “The Good Old Days,” and both
Oscar and Lily Brayton will be seen in it,
as also will Eve Grey, who has done very
well on English stages since she left Aus-
tralia. Wensley Russell, who visited the
Commonwealth with Asche in “Cairo,” is
also in the cast.
“Hamfat”: Young George Palmer, Mel-
bourne's 16-year-old picture-maker, secured
a fair number of releases for his first film,
"The Mail Robber,” and is now passing on to
a new venture. Impressed by the youngster's
possibilities Australasian Films is turning
the camera on a scenario he has beaten out
himself, in which he will be the prime actor.
“Wallaby”: Absorbed in my contemplation
of the rock flathead on the marble ledge in
Popoffolis’s fishshop, it was some time before
I was aware of the presence of an important-
looking, slightly-swaying, purple-chinned per-
son, with a heavy coat and fur collar. Of
no appeal to him was the neat silvery dis-
play ; he confined his attention to the Greek’s
crays. After several lurching attempts, he
now with expert deftness flipped back the
folded tail of a beady-eyed, evil-clawed crus-
tacean. Satisfied as to its freshness, he sum-
moned an olive-skinned assistant. “Das beeg
one—das four an’ seex,” pronounced this
greasy individual. At this intelligence the
frame of the imposing stranger shook with
emotion. “Four and six! Outrageous!” he
said at length. “Come, now, at least you’ll
allow 15 per cent, off for the profession?"
But the blank expression on the assistant's
inartistic face gave out no hope. With a
sighful “Ah, me! of what avails it nowa-
days?” the stranger made his dignified exit.
CRITICISM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“He is said to be one of the greatest comedians
in the world” —Melbourne payer’s theatrical critic.
Puff par. and published ad. attest
That Percy Algernon Fitzjames
Is one of Stageland’s very best —
That there are few more shining names
In Thespian ranks; and we agree—-
That this is what he’s said to be.
A critic went to see the play.
He thought the scenery immense.
Constructed in the grandest way
With no regard for the expense.
Ilis was no isolated view—
He found the programme said so, too.
The plot he voted one to enthral.
There’s trouble over someone dead;
But, ere they take the last recall,
The heroine and hero wed.
It stirred him, he declared —and spied
Posters that screamed the same outside.
Brisk was the action, he opined ;
The girls were more than passing fair ;
In fact, he’d be surprised to find
A better drama anywhere—
And if more guidance any need,
Well, they have got the ads. to read!

■just as thousands of Republics
are doing in road work—
It gives us great pleasure to recom-
mend the 3'/2-ton Republic truck,
equipped with hydraulic dump,
as being one of the best pieces of
machinery that we have ever
seen. We are well pleased with
the truck and are glad to state
that it has done a great deal more
work than we expected it to do.
We use it for pulling the grader, for
plowing up our streets, for digging ditches
and pulling our ten thousand pound roller,
also for packing the streets. We have
run it since July 18, 1918, and outside of a
three dollar repair bill caused by driving
it into a bad bridge, we have not paid out a cent on the
truck and we are glad to recommend it to any person desiring
a truck that will do all kinds of work.

KELVINATED
FOODS
Kelvinator is an unobtrusive little machine which
does away with the necessity for ice. Placed in any
position out of the way, it keeps the temperature of the ice-
chest at a uniform degree of cold day and night. It works
itself, and requires no looking after or adjusting. No more
dank, soggy ice-chest odor, nuisance of frequent scouring out,
or dependence on the ice-man,
It keeps foods cold—really cold —and perfectly sweet indefi-
nitely, It provides ice for table use, more than you can use.
It is colder than ice and cheaper.
The Kelvinator is not a cheap article, but adds the finishing touch to the well-
appointed home.
It is a convenience you will later regard as a necessity.
Kelvinator means hygiene; it means economy in cost of food and labor; it means
a better standard of living. It is destined to become as necessary as a bathroom,
bend for the Kelvinator literature. You will find it absorbingly interesting.

L. Towns: “Movies” doesn’t suggest that
you have much personal knowledge of the subject.
. ...J.V.C.: Quite right. Another contributor pointed
out last week that it is the Pacific Ocean Cocos
which is to have the treasure-seeker’s attention.
... .W. Char: “Sleep” was beaten at the last wink.
It didn’t sound true....G. Dibs: “Non-combatant”
is a rather dull person....C. Peg: The jingles are
just fair, but the subjects don’t help to win them
a place Carpathia: Not much promise there.
Your ear needs cultivating. .. .Isobel C.: Ordinary
travel notes are outside our scheme of things....
T.H.H.: We don’t recommend it. For one thing,
it is paying far too much for its office and ware-
house accommodation.... Packard: Has that swindle
been worked again, or is it the old tale retold?....
Bar; No hope of using “Walk-over” in the time. ...
No. 719: Sorry, but it’s so rough we were lame
in both feet before we were half through it
O.M.M.: Discussed at some length a couple of
months ago. ... J.J.D.: You haven’t made it con-
vincing C.H. (Gosford): Well enough written,
but not enough marrow in its bones.... Akran: The
shark incident doesn’t make a story. ... A.M.L.:
Not specially mirthful... .S.S. (Innisfail) : Those
lonely deaths in the bush have been very frequent.
Yours is quite of the usual pattern. .. .J.B.M.: One
stanza should make careless people think
Oh thoughts of life,
Ah vain regret!
Consider what it is!
Pretence is rife—
Why do we fret?
Contented be with is!
W.C. (W.A.) : The pearl yarn is a bit extrava-
gant-—the ending particularly so. By the way,
would vinegar do the job ? Critics of the old tale
say it wouldn’t.... Lorin: It doesn’t get near the
pay desk... .A.B.M.: Sorry, but it doesn’t strike
us where we keep our smiles.... Sam M.: Not up
by a very long way. .. .M.N.B.: Not bad, but as
slight as the season’s most fashionable figure....
Silas C.: Nothing there W.N.T.: Horrible
Wallace C.: The sonnet is almost prose...-Plodder:
Both miss. One rhyme per line is the fair measure
except in special cases; and fair scansion without
twisting the order of the- words in the sentence
is essential for grace and simplicity... .R.G.W.:
The man who can rhyme “Colchester” with “oyster”
has an ear far outlawed from the ways of song....
Brady’s Lookout: Too rough, but somewhere in the
right direction.... F.J.K.: As weak as the fourth
brew of tea. So it can’t be that which makes it
wobble so....C.C. (Paddington): Lamentable assault
on mirth.... Martha: Blank verse must be a great
deal better than that.. . .E.J.G.: Keeps the old
track. . . .A.W.V.K.; Not enough skill. . . .S.F.N.: The
form, with its short yelps, takes all the pathos out
of it....Nye: Doesn’t get near.... Tom K.: We
don’t like parodies. We don’t like your way of
inventing words to make rhymes. In fact, we
don’t like anything about it....Cameo: Poor in
manner and matter. .. .M.L.F.: The bumpy movement
is not attractive and the ideas are not fresh....
Lyn C.: A weak effort to say what many
have said. .. . J.R.L.: Wretched. .. .C.E.S.: Not up.
....Esmond; Too little there for a tale; but it
has the makings of a par....E.M.: Originality is
its -strong point:—
Must get a coat of Teddy D.
To serve the Tommie Lock,
The warmest thing until the Spring
That Teddy D. has got.
The money ging the scarcest thing
In Tommie’s Wallet Pot.
I pray the Lord to Warm the heart
Of Teddy I), a lot,
A woolly sort, and not too Smart,
For Tommie’s gammy spots,
But comfee for a Winter’s dart
The healing thing dots.
....E.L. (Katoomba) : One is old and not convinc-
ing in its setting; the other leaves us in doubt as
to whether he really did murder the woman....
A.J.P.; Rather thin. . . .M.H.H.: Commonplace obser-
vations . ... F. O. Mac: Too many bumps in it....
A.L.W.: Misses... .J.R.S.; They don’t strike us....
N.M.S.; The description seems made to fit the
rhymes, except the “dawn”-“morn,” which seems
only intended to insult the ear.... Coppertop: Gentle
and not very exciting melodrama. .. .Sisera: The
makings of a yarn. Try again.... Charles S.: You
make it a bit tedious... .H.W.D.: Far off our beat,
.i.. Marjorie IV.; It is a lament on an old pattern.
.... Bellerive: The recollections of the Caulfield Cup
calamity of 1885 will move many an aged punter
to tears:—
While riding to win
A clever lightweight
In the tragic Cup smash
Did meet a sad fate.
As riders lay prone ’neath
The glare of the sun,
Jockey Jack Williams
Upon Grace Darling won.
When to the casualty-room
The injured were bore,
Among the bookies and punters.
Did ensue an uproar.
The thrilling news spread
Throughout Melbourne town.
That pet candidates in the
Smash had came down.
. ...C.B.M.: Unattractive; and you handicap your-
self by crowding your typewritten lines together.
.... Gordon T.: Hardly' worth while.... Macklen:
Don’t know what Digger units marched from Tel-el-
Kebir to the Canal in ’16; but some reader may
remember Pif-paf: Well, whether anything comes
out of the Deportation Board or not, it is up to
the labor unions of Australia to hold an inquiry
and determine whether or not they have been made
tools of D.H.T.: You spring to the most astound-
ing conclusions... .R.M.H.: The best you have done;
but the subject isn’t enticing.... Riwaka: Thanks;
but already dealt with.'
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.R.S.: The dromedary gives us the hump.
G.T.: Stiff ladies in unfashionable frocks exchang-
ing pleasantries with tailor’s models are in very
small demand.... G.M.; You seem to be on the
way....H.G. (M.L.); Coming home on the wings
of the mailboat.

The Beale Piano is recognised as an instrument of quality in
almost every walk of life.
Her Majesty, Queen Mary, recently purchased at Wembley
Exhibition a Beale Piano for Buckingham Palace.
Leading authorities and critics in the musical world, orchestral
directors, educational establishments, statesmen, judges, the
wealthiest of the land, speak in highest praise of the Beale
instrument.
The N.S.W. State Conservatorium of Music—an institute
embracing the best musical experts —in 1924 installed no fewer
than 19 Beale Pianos.
The Presbyterian Ladies Colleges at Pymble, Croydon and
Goulburn, have used Beale Pianos for many years. The princi-
pals have had such entire satisfaction from these instruments
that they have purchased others from time to time as required,
until now there are over 30 Beale Pianos in use.
But beyond all this, the great general public—the final court
of critical judgment—have sealed their approval to the extent
of over 60,000 Beale instruments.
Beale Pianos and Player-Pianos are sold on an extended payment plan
that brings them within reach of the most modest income. Liberal
allowances made on used instruments which are accepted in partial
exchange.

“My heart with pleasure thrills
And dances with the daffodils”
When penning these lines Wordsworth must have felt in a father
exultant mood. A heart that wants to go jazzing with the daffo-
dils is unusually rare, and what a merry old world this would
be if we could all have those feelings. But> modern Conditions
of living intervene. The constant race against time means
hurried and irregular meals, which in time claim their pitiless
toll in the form of Acute Indigestion
And it’s when the digestive organs become clogged with poisonous
secretions that those dull, nagging pains in the stomach arise.
Headaches, constipation and despondency follow—life doesn’t
seem to be worth living
In this state you require a true service medicine, such as that reliable old family jnend

A safe health-giving, blood=purifying aperient that positively
drives away impurities from the stomach, and keeps the

“Clerk”: Travellers on the Vic. railways
can now have their luggage picked up at
their door and despatched for them to the
station to which they are booked. The car-
rier calls, issues the usual departmental
luggage-check and then takes the luggage, the
traveller collecting it on arrival at his
destination station. The only stipulation,
apart from the payment of the ordinary car-

“Shed Hand” : I can't accept “Geo. Rich’s”
story of the ’Westralian goods porter who
was carpeted and cautioned for not sending
a livestock crate, weighing about 1081 b., to
the workshops to have two nails driven in
(B. As a W.A. goods porter for
many yeaps, I have almost reconstructed
livestock crates, repaired poultry coops,
mended hand-barrows by the score, straight-
ened bai&ow axles (heated in the engine fire-
boxes) ~ doctored gates, doors, roofs, trucks and
floors, painted signs, spliced ropes, designed
crane-liooks and made portable desks for
checkers unloading trucks. I have even
broken, mended and made rules.
* * * *
*‘Borom”: A few weeks ago the retail
price of a tin of the “Peacock” braud or best
grade of opium dropped from nearly £2O
to about £6 in Sydney—clear indication that
a large consignment had just been smuggled.
During the past two years the price of the
stuff has seldom risen above £lO, and once
or twice it has been as low as £3. There is
believed to be a well»organised ring at the
back of operations. Only occasional ship-
ments come to tine big ports; the bulk of
the stuff is smuggled in at spots on the north-
ern coastline. One quite recent consign-
ment, landed, at a spot on the Queensland
coast ancj, transported safely to Sydney in-
side a vjfeek, ran into several hundred tins.
*¥ * * *
“liked”: It was poor staff work which
allowed Customs Comptroller Oakley to go
before the Tariff Board in Sydney and ask
for a removal of the duty on rennet, an in-
gredient of cheese made from the fourth
stomach of calves, because the stuff was “not
made in Australia.” The request brought
Homebush Abattoirs expert Creswick before
the Board to testify that he was making first
quality rennet, enough to supply all Aus-
tralia, and that at 11s. per gallon as against
355. asked for the imported article. Surely
a short note of inquiry to less than half a
dozen likely makers of rennet would have
saved the Customs chief from too ready
acceptance of some importer’s cock-and-bull
story.
“Sturt”: The new structure across the
river at Murray Bridge (S.A.) is 1900 ft.
long—easily the longest in the State. The
principal span is 240 ft., but the bridging has
to continue far on to swampy land, and
much of the two years taken over the job
was spent in preliminary boring—nearly 50
shafts—to find the best location. The old
bridge, a tx-ifie to the north of the new one,
has hunk disconcertingly in its 40 years of
but it is thought that the long piles of
die new one-—7O to 90 feet—are all down to
a solid foundation. The safety of this bridge
is an important thing for Australia; with
it out of action from any cause, the railway
system of the continent, east to West, would
be just cut in halves.
“H.K.”: Though as far back as 1803 an
oar-propelled ferry service between Sydney
and Parramatta was established by an enter-
prising woman, one Ann Marsh, it was not
till 1832 that there was a regular service,
On October 5 in that year the Experiment
made her initial trip from the old. fruit-
growing town to the metropolis. Her time
from wharf to wharf, including a few stops,
was three hours. She was propelled by
horse-power—not engines; the animals them-
selves. They walked round in a circle on
the deck in the same fashion as they are
often employed nowadays to cut chaff. There
subsequently came the Swan, a paddle-
wheeler, with first- and second-class accom-
modation.
* * * *
“Erua”: “Herodot's” tale of the man
who lived on the bounty of harassed motor-
ists (B. 22/10/’2o) deals with the sort of
thing that makes the insurance manager
thump his blotting-pad and wish to Heaven
that “the insured” would have the sense to
read his policy. He is therein implored
never to admit liability—in fact, the ideal
policy-holder does not even admit he is in-
sured, leaving all that to the assessors, who
may be relied on to ferret out all particu-
lars. The insured who deals direct with the
victim hampers matters considerably, and he
who pays a lump sum to the injured man—•
who is certain of fair treatment from, the
companies—admits liability and complicates
his case from the start. The uninsured
motorist —-but are there such idiots about V
* * * *
“Sierra”: There are still five square-
rigged vessels in commission under the red
ensign—the Kilmallie, now at Sydney; the
William Mitchell and Garthneill, on their
way to Melbourne; and the Monkbarns and
Garthpool, at Callao. Three are owned by
Stewart and Co., of Glasgow, and two by
Garthwaite, of Montreal. All the vessels were
built in the early ’nineties, and sentiment
rather than profit-making keeps them still
breasting the seas. Last year the Garth-
pool and Garthneill were marked for the
boneyard, but their owner, Sir William
Garthwaite, yielding to the sentiment ex-
pressed by correspondents, sent the ships
on another profitless trip round the world.
Although sailors regret the passing of the
sailing ship, few will be sorry to see these
faded beauties finally laid to rest.

They Know
The way to whiter teeth. Will you not find it out?
Those many people you meet with
glistening teeth do something you
should do.
They have gained new beauty and
new charm. But they have also gained
new cleanliness, new safety.
They use a new method of teeth
cleaning. Let this test show how much
it means to you.
They combat the dingy film
You feel on teeth a viscous film.
That is what clouds teeth.
Under old-way brushing, much of
that film remains. It becomes dis-
coloured, then forms dingy coats, to
make the teeth unsightly and unclean.
Film also holds food substance which
ferments and forms acid. Germs breed
by millions in it. They, with tartar,
are the chief cause of pyorrhea.
Science has sought ways to combat
that film. It has found two which
proved effective in many careful tests.
One disintegrates the film at all stages
of formation, one removes it without
harmful scouring.
Authorities have endorsed these
methods. A new-type tooth paste has
been created to apply them daily.
The name is Pepsodent.
This short test is convincing
The user of Pepsodent sees at once
results which old ways never brought.
Send the form for a 10-Day Tube.
Note how clean the teeth feel after
using.
Then decide between the new
way and the old. Do this for your
home's sake. Cut out form now.

From G. Cheverton and Co.:—
Apropos of the Grafton-Ivyogle-Brisbane railway
(B. 8/10/’25), there is nothing in the nawspaper
report that the best tender is £BO,OOO per mile.
As tenderers for the first and roughest section of the
job, distance about 27 miles, we can assure you that
our tender is well under £40,000 per mile, and
therefore less than the Government estimate.
“Stellsby”: Add my happy pair to the
list of wedded couples who didn’t permit the
ceremony to interfere with the day’s wort
(B. 15/10/’25). The bridegroom was a
tailor in a Victorian northern town, and the
bride his forewoman tailoress. Leaving the
church after being made one, they went
straight back to graft.
“Runa”: Speaking of collecting damages
from motorists (B. 22/10/’25), a while ago
an astute individual was drawing a weekly
subsidy from half a dozen companies in Syd-
ney and living comfortably on the total. The
fraud was discovered by accident —a young
clerk from one co. ran round the corner to
another to borrow some papers, and found
tie man who had just vacated a chair in his
office waiting to collect in the other firm's
corridor.
“X.N.0.”: The Navy can’t afford to bo so
careless about its time as “Aus. Div.” (B.
22/10/’25) says the A.I.F. was when it
treated midnight as either 23.59 or 00.01.
It is a rule that if any doubt may arise about
the day the latter must be appended to the
time. There can be no doubt that 0000/17
means what shore people call midnight on
the 10th; it could also be written 2400/10.
By the way, the Navy never uses the un-
necessary fullstops between hours and
minutes.
“Mela”: The Belgian boy smuggled on
board the Kaiser-i-Hind (B. 15/10/’25)
was found wandering behind the lines,
orphaned and friendless, and promptly
adopted by the Australian Flying Corps. On
arrival in Australia lie was given a job as
a junior messenger on the staff of the secre-
tary of the R.A.A.F.,' and is there still. The
lad, who is well-mannered and intelligent, is
the proud possessor of the R.S.S.I.L.A.
badge, having been elected to life member-
ship so that he can keep in touch with old
friends.
Some R.C. history was told at the recent
induction of a priest to the parish of Cole-
raine (Vic.). Coleraine has for nearly 70
years been served by Hamilton, and for 40
of them that Grand Old Man of Australian
Catholicism, Monsignor Shanahan, has
driven in his old Mass shandrydan twice a
month or more from Hamilton to Coleraine
and back. He lias travelled 50,000 miles
in these trips. It is 66 years since the first
R.C. church was built in Coleraine. One of
the original congregation is still an attendant
—“Billy” Kaine, as he is affectionately'
called.
“Alwyn”: The Drummoyne (Syd.) muni-
cipal council holds the original certificate
of the grant of 1500 acres upon which that
thriving Parramatta River suburb is now
built. The papers, still very well preserved,
were issued by Governor King in 1806; the
grantee was surgeon John Harris, of Ultimo
House, the founder of the family which sup-
plied both the N.S.W. Assembly and the
Sydney City Council with some of its earlier
members.. It was in the mayoralty of one
of them that the present Town Hall was
built. Surgeon John, by the way, was one
of three magistrates who once sentenced a
man to a flogging of a thousand strokes.
“Pick”: Certain localities have a fancy
for queer place-names. In the N.S.W. South
Coast ranges three peaks are Pintpot,
Quartpot and Brassknocker. The Drome-
dary is an isolated mountain eastward.
Cattle-stations in the Avild region are Slap-
up, Countaguinca, Cattle Duffer and Big
Badger. A swampy area south of Big Badger
is Digmeout, and a hill farther south is
Whatsup. Captain’s Flat, in the northern
Jingeras, commemorates no person of sea-
faring or military title. It Avas named after
an old working bullock that constantly
roamed back there when released from Joe
Lamkin’s team.
“Adelaide” : The annual picnic of the market-
gardeners of Adelaide was an even bigger
thing than usual this year. Nobody seems
to know when it started, but the veteran John
Hammer has been attending for 40 years.
About 1000 families (estimated) get a good
living in this industry, and export to Broken
Hill and many Centralian towns; and all of
them are good white Australians. Also, they
are proud of their job, and find it a pros-
perous one. The procession of decorated
vehicles and the picnic on Kensington Oval,
with its host of motor-cars, are a great sight,
and an object-lesson to some other capitals
on the folly of leaving the world’s oldest pro-
fession (for men) to Ah Sin.
“X.N.0.”: I am not sure I agree with
“Forebridge” about the uselessness of Gal-
way Harbor (B. 15/10/’25) . A good many
years ago there was a serious proposal to
substitute Galway for Liverpool as the trans-
Atlantic port of the United Kingdom, the
idea behind the suggestion being that it
would benefit Ireland enormously in her then
troubled state by “creating a divarsion” as
it were, and promoting such secondary in-
dustries as would arise at and near an over-
seas port. Of course, as a natural harbor Gal-
way is miles behind Hobart, Rio, Sydney and
Port Stephens ; but it is not what a harbor is
that matters, but Avhat can be made of it.
Victoria nearly lost the services of Frank
Tate, Director of Education, 32 years ago.
He was a lecturer at the teachers’ training
college, Carlton, when the Patterson Govern-
ment, pursuing a policy of retrenchment,
closed up the institution. As a temporary
expedient Tate was put on to supervise the
breaking-in of pupil-teachers at classes in
the Workingmen’s College, and the brilliant
young man became depressed at the gloomy
prospects. Departmental chiefs feared that
he would cross to another State, and kept
their eye on him. The tide soon turned. He
became an inspector, then principal of the
training college, Avliicli Avas re-opened, and
next Director of Education. That Avas 23
years, ago, and from then on it has not been
safe in Victoria to retrench on education —
with consummate art Tate has more than
once appealed to the people over Govern-
ments and Parliament, and has won.

Miss LEILA
HEXNEY, a beauti-
ful Rexona Qirl,
writes ; —
“I have been
using Rexona Soap,
for two years, and
I not only find it a
good soap for the
shin, but it is a
•wonderful shampoo
for the hair.”
Girls! Why Not Enjoy
a Good Complexion?
You cannot if you do not care for the delicate skin of the face. When
you wash your face do you realise that it is not enough to simply remove the
dirt, but that your skin needs a soothing, healing influence to keep your
complexion fresh and free from blemish? Scented toilet soaps are often very
pleasant, but do not assert this influence, as you are well aware. Many of
them contain free alkali, which tends to dry up the skiu and destroy its
delicate texture. Even the better class of such soaps do not in any way help
to improve the skin, but Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is not only an absolutely
pure soap, but is medicated on the same principle as the famous Rexona
Ointment, which is known throughout Australasia as the Rapid Healer. That
is why Rexona Soap really does for the skin and face what cosmetics are
supposed to do, by ensuring not only a clean face, but a pure and healthy skin,
and thus gives you a clear complexion.

Knut Olsen’s Weird.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
KNUT OLSEN grew by a bleak fiord
Where cold hills frown, in the
farthest Nord ;
In the chilly light of Arctic morn,
'Neath a reindeer-rug was Olsen born.
V wise old wife by the beside stood
To make a charm that was strong and good.
She wet his navel with wine, and took
In her wrinkled hands the Holy Book,
And uttered the names of angels nine ;
Then over his head she made a sign
And palmed her silver and closed the door,
And crossing its threshold came no more.
A witch-wife laughed when she heard the
rune
The night-owl told to a waning moon —
That magic white of the old good wife
To shield Ivnut’s soul from sorrow and strife.
She made a magic with blood and brine
And muttered the names of devils nine.
With blood and brine and a drowned man's
hair
This evil witch, in her smoky lair,
Black magic made that a seaman’s son
Might evilly end when all was done.
Since Olsen's woman her love had ta’en
A snake on her heart had hourly lain.
To Odin nor Christ again would she —
Till Satan had claimed her—bend a knee.
Love has a magic; but so has Hate.
The fruits of Time are ripened by Fate;
The fruits of Time that lie in the seed—
Thus was the weird of Ivnut Olsen dreed.
Ere come to manhood he sailed away
As ever they sailed from Norroway.
Sinewed and strong, like his sires whose oars
Cluttered the seaways to Saxon shores,
Blonde as a viking, simple of heart,
One with his messmates, but yet apart.
Ports of the cold seas, ports of the sun,
All in Time’s fulness roughly he won.
Living his life as he fared along—
Quarrels and friendships, discord or song,
liquors and gaming, flesh and its lure
Bringing in sequence fever and cure.
Learning his sea-lore, head, heart and hand,
Gained him his guerdon, second command.
Mate of the Freda! Good that a man
Order his life on effort and plan.
Rise o’er his fellows, follow alone
Calls of Ambition, come to his own.
* * * *
Tholsen her master —Tholsen, whose wife
Borning a sea-babe, gave up her life;
Freda the fair-haired, joyous and free
As any glad bird that wings the sea,
Pale as a lily save for her lips,
Child of blue waters, daughter of ships.
Freda the fair-haired —shoulders of foam,
Eyes like the ocean, ship for her home —
She with her sire sails, Olsen the mate !
Fruits in full time are ripened by fate.
Flowers of all time are held in the seed —
Thus was the weird that Ivnut Olsen dreed.
Freda the blue-eyed, and Ivnut the strong—*
Love is a passage that lasts not long!
Found they its harbor and found it soon —
Night in the tropics, chance and the moon,
White sails just drawing, warm seas to break
In sighs of longing softly awake.
These for their wooing, kisses and troth.
Bringing new wonder of life to both.
Love has her triumphs, but so has hate;
The sheai*s of Time are sharpened by fate:
The fruits of chance are laid in the seed—
Now mark the weird that Knut Olsen dreed!
A cyclone shot from a tropic sky.
A reef uncharted, a midnight cry!
Stout bulwarks riven, ships’ boats o’er-
turned.
And love’s lamp quenched ere its light had
burned.
A week of horror! The wild wands raved;
And all hands perished but one man saved!
* * * *
Knut Olsen, the trader, all men know r
Who round the low islands come and go.
Knut Olsen, the trader, man of sin,
With his native wives. But when trade gin
Has brought him vision he looks, they say,
Over the beaches and far aw r ay.
Birds in the palm-trees may call and coo,
But ever, with eyes of fading blue.
He looks away. Though the children play.
And the young girls dance, he looks away r
But his fade is changed, they say—they say
His face is changed when he looks away,
She wrote her rune with the sand and brine;
She muttered the names of devils nine.
To Odin nor Christ no more did she—
Till Satan had claimed her—bend the knee.
The fruits of Time are held in the seed ;
So was the weird of Ivnut Olsen dreed.

E. J. BRADY.
The Table that Turned.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AFTER graduating medically, Jocelyn
Jarvis put up her brass-plate on the
door of a ground-floor room in a house
in a suburb by a selective process given over
to the mansions and bungalows of the well-
to-do. It w T as automatically made a “re-
served" locality by the price per foot of its
spacious allotments, all commanding a view
of Sydney harbor and the Heads. The people
who live on the award wage and less receive
the consolation from many pulpits that they
will find their indigence an advantage in-
stead of a disability in a better world, though
they are prevented from entering'this suburb
by the simple obstacle of the price ‘of land.
Instead of narrow streets and lanes in which
the dingy houses stick together like a row
of books, where each household knows the
domestic affairs of its neighbor on either side
owing to the slenderness of dividing walls
and the contiguity of back yards, and the
households fraternise or fight with each other
through the mere provocation of propinquity,
the mansions and bungalow's of this suburb
stood proudly aloof so that neighbors need
not pretend to know r each other’s affairs,
which they did, nevertheless, through the
parleyings of chauffeurs and parlormaids.
The kitchen has always been a changing
house of news, and what the kitchen knows
to-day the missus knows to-morrow, or
sooner if the news be spicy.
The whole suburb took the greatest in-
terest in the new lady doctor because to the
inscription on her plate of
Jocelyn Jarvis, M. 8,,
were added the words
Specialist in Eugenics.
The fact that eugenics had to do with mar-
riage gave a rare interest to the new 7 prac-
titioner in the eyes of spinsters, and eugenics
were freely discussed in the suburb at after-
noon teas. Oyntliia Hardle, wdio had escaped
marriage for a half-century, now announced
that the true reason for her refusal to marry
hitherto was an inner warning that, of the
many suitors who had menaced, all were
either physically or mentally untit to mate
with her.
"My nebulous but probably spiritually-
( sent antipathies and suspicions," she de-
' dared impressively, “have now 7 become a
science. With the advent of practitioners
like Dr, Jarvis, girls in a few years will
be saved from being dragged by vampires
to the altar of doom.” When pretty Kitty
Bangs, young as w r ell as good-looking, made
the comment that would-be brides would in
fairness have to be “eugenic” as well as
men, Cynthia remarked acidly that girls
who had suspicions of the purity of their
blood should certainly be examined by Dr.
Jarvis. That, she said, with a meaning
glare at Kitty, would be a matter for their
own conscience.
In all matters pertaining to sex it is well-
knowm that curiosity is the weakness and
often the peril of the woman of inexperience.
Therefore Kitty Bangs went to see the
eugenist doctor on a voyage of discovery. She
expected to meet somebody of the acidulous
type of Cynthia Hardle. Instead of this she
was astounded to meet a young woman who
was very prepossessing—a perfect “cinder
blonde,” w 7 itli that elasticity of motion wdiich
is the sign of bodily health and a line muscu-
lar system. Her hair was a pale gold, her
eyes grey as a cuckoo’s wing—like those of
the girl in Victor Daley’s poem—and her
complexion w 7 as of that clear creaminess tnat
belongs to this type of blonde. The con-
tours of her figure w 7 ere, Kitty admitted,
quite faultless. Dr. Jarvis radiated intense
vitality. Kitty Bangs reflected that such
a young woman. might well be a eugenist.
for, so far as outw 7 ard seeming w 7 ent, no
test could find a flaw in that physique.
In the consulting-room Kitty saw nothing
severe. It was just like an ordinary sitting-
room, very bright and airy. Whatever in-
strumentalities Dr. Jarvis worked with were
not in evidence. Seated in an easy chair
Kitty found herself the subject of a close
scrutiny from the cugenist's calm, pretty
eyes.
"What can I do for you, Miss Bangs?”
A little upset by the intent way in which
the clear grey eyes looked into her own,
Kitty replied :
“It’s about Jack, you know. He wants
us to be married, and I should like your
advice as to whether I should find out first
whether he is eugenical, and that sort of
thing. Of course,” she went on, “he’s hand-
some and tall and dark and very strong.
He’s a football champion and a cricketer
and a boxer, and his room is full of cups
and goblets.”
The mention of cups and goblets stirred
some curiosity in Dr. Jocelyn.
“What does lie need all those drinking
utensils for?” she inquired.
“Oh, he doesn’t drink from them,” Kitty
explained. “He is quite sober, as a rule.
The cups and goblets are trophies he w 7 on
in his athletic career.”
“I see,” the doctor said. “What is his
occupation ?”
“He is the manager of a brewery.”
Dr. Jocelyn entered the information in a
large memorandum-book.
“I shall ascertain later,” she remarked,
“what kind of children a father steeped in
the odor of beer can be expected to have.
Perhaps we shall insist that he should sur-
render this occupation.”
Kitty gasped. “If I insisted on that Jack
might surrender me. It is his living. In
fact, if he surrendered his job he would
have to surrender me —or I would have to
surrender him. People cannot live without
an income of some kind. If eugenics mean
that when a girl does get a man she would
like, and the first thing she does is to ask
him to give up his job, I don't think it is
going to be very popular. Besides, Jack
says that the smell of the vats and things is
quite healthy. Only yesterday he told me
that all the men working in the brewery got
liog-fat in a few years.”
Dr. Jocelyn seized on this fact and made
a note of it. “Very interestihg,” she com-
mented, “and bearing on my suggestion. You
know, Miss Bangs, that men who suddenly
grow hog-fat, which is rather a good term,
are very likely to become unhealthy. We
may leave this matter over for further con-
sideration when the more important basic
matters are settled,” she remarked. “I want
a specimen of this young man’s blood. The
blood is the most wonderful index eugenism
has. We have various tests for various de-
fects, and I could not proceed to help you
in the least without making the essential
blood-test. Bring him- along and I will take
a sample. We have a complete analysing
outfit at the University.”
“Couldn’t be done,” Kitty said emphati-
cally. “If I asked him to do it he’d think
I was mad.”
“That makes the matter more difficult,”
Dr. Jocelyn admitted. “Would he object,
do you think, to giving you a specimen if
you asked him? I suppose you could rely
-on him not to palm off somebody else’s blood
on you?”
“I think I could,” Kitty said tartly, “if
I asked him. But as I don’t want the only
man l have ever eared for to think I am a
cannibal, I don’t propose to ask him for
any such thing.”
Dr. Jocelyn took no notice of Kitty’s
rising temper.
“We must try an artifice, then. Let me
suggest one of the devices which have been
decided upon by the inner council of the
eugenical organisation to meet such a case.
Suppose, when your fiance next comes to

A Fair Warning
One That Should Be Heeded by All
Frequently the first sign of kidney trouble is a slight
ache or pain in the loins. Neglect of this warning makes
the way easy for more serious troubles—gravel, dropsy,
rheumatism, and other serious forms of kidney disease.
’Tis well to pay attention to the first sign. Weak
kidneys generally grow weaker, and neglect is often

dangerous. People in Australia place reliance in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. This tested remedy
has been used in kidney trouble for years, and is recommended all over the civilised world.
INTERESTING SYDNEY EVIDENCE.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. S. Drew, 28 Briggs Street, Camperdown, Sydney, says :—“Some
time ago my kidneys were in a seriously disordered state and in consequence
I suffered terribly. My back never stopped aching, and I was almost crippled
with the ailment. Dropsical swellings showed on my legs and ankles, and
there was puffiness under my eyes. The state of my health worried me
terribly, and as I had taken all sorts of remedies without deriving any
benefit, I was beginning to think I would never be well again. However, at
last I got Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and they proved a godsend. The
first couple of bottles eased my suffering a little, and seven bottles of the
pills cured me completely.”
Five years later Mrs. Drew says:—“l have had no return of my old
complaint since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me over five years ago.”
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Jas. C. Struck, Yugilbali. 4 Eurella Street, Burwood, Sydney, says:
“Seven years ago I was very ill with a bad attack of disordered kidneys. I
suffered excruciating agony from backache and was at times so bad that I
could hardly move. Everything I had to do was a trouble, and I was miser-
able and depressed. The kidney secretions were thick and cloudy and
contained a red .sediment, and my ankles swelled to twice their usual size.
I went on suffering in this way for a long time, nothing I took doing me any
good, but at last I got the right remedy, and that was Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. After taking two bottles of these Pills I felt much relieved,
and by the time I had finished eight bottles I was completely cured and felt
a different man.”
Ten years later Mr. Struck says:—“Thanks to Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills I am still free from backache and kidney trouble.”

see you, you arrange that he is seated in a
position which will enable you to stumble
accidentally and bring your elbow violently
against the bridge of his nose. If the im-
pact is sufficiently severe, some of the small
blood-vessels are certain to be ruptured and
his nose will bleed. It would be quite natu-
ral for you to use your handkerchief in an
attempt to stanch the flovv, and we shall
get our specimen for analysis.”
Kitty wondered to hear this programme
of sabotage and unfaith set forth so frankly
by this pretty, calm-eyed young woman. The
position seemed unreal.
“Do you think,” she said with feeling,
“that I could break Jack’s nose with my
elbow and steal his blood for you to experi-
ment with? No decent girl would do that
to a stranger, much less to the man she
loves. Besides, Jack might see that I did
it purposely, and if he did he would be
frightfully angry—suppose he gave me one
on the nose? A taxicab-driver had an argu-
ment last week with Jack about a fare, and
hit Jack on the nose —it is bruised yet—
and they took him to the hospital. The taxi-
man, I mean.”
“We will abandon that device,” the
eugenist replied. “If it is not done skilfully
it is as well not to attempt it. A mistake
might be serious. If, for instance, you were
to plunge the point of your elbow into his
eye, the vision might, be destroyed.
“I think the whole proposal is brutal,”
said Kitty emotionally, “and I think eugenics
is disgustingly cold-blooded, if these are its
methods.”
“Emotionalism and sentiment!” Dr.
Jocelyn sighed. “These are the chief enemies
science has to meet in trying to bring about
the perfect marriage. In your case the
dreadful affinity called love is a bar to the
exercise of judgment. It is our chief
obstacle. And it is very selfish of those who
indulge it, for they put their silly individual
preferences before the great objective of
the production of a perfect race.”
Kitty looked at this strange woman, so
handsome, yet so cold.
“Don’t you believe in love?” she asked.
“Certainly not. It is the enemy of science,
the foe to that sane selectiveness which en-
sures the lovely harmony of perfectly con-
stituted entities. But as well as individual
affinities there are racial affinities to be in-
sisted upon, no less. I am pure Nordic
and I must marry pure Nordic.”
“I’m glad,” Kitty said, “that I have
not to consider these things. If you told
me Jack was not eugenical for me, I'd marry
him all the same, for I love him. If people
who are not eugenical are to be stopped
from marrying, it seems to me that this
world is going to be littered with bachelors
and cluttered up with old maids. What will
eugenics do with them?”
“There,” said Dr. Jocelyn, “you have
stumbled on our chief difficulty at the out-
set. In the course of time the superb race
produced by the application of the principles
of eugenics will be able to impose its will
upon the lesser peoples, bred haphazard.
Science is not impotent to deal w r ith the
unfit even nowq but public opinion is not
yet ripe—has not emancipated itself from
the mediaeval conception of marriage. That
is one bar. The other is that savage impul-
siveness which you call love.”
Dr. Jocelyn spoke with such perfect poise
that Kitty wondered whether she was being
addressed by a woman or an intellectual
machine, whether the ice of science had
entirely quenched the fires which normally
would burn in this desirable looking creature,
Kitty rose to go.
.My fee for this consultation is two
guineas.” Dr. Jocelyn held out a small
white hand.
As she paid the money Kitty asked casu-
ally, “Do you know Dr. Hyacinth Potus?”
Dr. Jocelyn smiled. “Quite well, she
answered.
Jack says how curious it is that a man
should have red hair and blue eyes when
his grandfather was a Turk.”
Dr. Jocelyn’s pose of composure was tem-
porarily ruined by this announcement, for,
as Kitty had heard the previous night, Dr.
h otus had just become engaged to Dr.
Jocelyn Jarvis.
*
“A Turk !”
But the blue eyes and the red hair! She
had often noticed how hard the fibres of
his hair were and how brilliantly metallic
was the blue of his eyes. Hair and eyes
lacked the Nordic softness. She discerned
now something exotic, alien, in the brilliant
personality which had attracted her as an
eminently suitable mate. That he claimed
to be pure Nordic carried no weight with
Dr. Jocelyn. A Turk would, under the cir-
cumstances, not hesitate at a lie.
, Before instituting inquiries, Dr. Jocelyn
decided to ask Potus to declare whether or
not his grandfather had been a Turk. She
wrote him a little note, putting the query,
You will quite understand the effect an
Asiatic intrusion upon a purely Nordic
strain would nave, but I defer comments
upon this, awaiting your reply to the simple
question which I put to you Is it true
that you are the grandson ot a Turk ?
She sent this note to Dr. Potus by her
maid In the afternoon a note arrived from
Dr. Potus asking her to meet him at 9.30
that evening at the hotel in town which
they favored as a meeting place. "There,
he wrote, “I will give you your answer
truthfully. Do not fail me.”
To Dr. Jocelyn’s clear mind these few lines
were a clear confession of guilt. Personally
Dr. Potus had proved responsive to every
eugenical test; but if racially he broke
down he must be discarded. Dr. Jocelyn
knew that there could be no appeal from the
verdict of science, light alone she fol-
lowed.
When she arrived at the hotel the lounge
and supper-room were crowded with guests;
but Dr. Potus had reserved a table for two.
“Not here,” she said as he met her. “We
can talk more privately in the card-room.”
As the hour was early this small room
was untenanted, and Dr. Jocelyn led her
fiance to a table, many eyes following the
distinguished couple. If Dr. Jocelyn looked
exceptional her companion was no less re-
markable. He was tall and lithe, with red
hair and blue eyes, blazing now as if hei had
just taken a “shot” of cocaine, which, as a
matter of fact, he had.
Although Dr. Potus had been in Sydney
for only five years his name was known
widely for his researches in the chemistry
of the flora of the Australian bush, a branch
of research which had been much neglected
until his advent in the field. The arena was
full of marvels, he had informed Jocelyn,
joyous with possibilities. It was rich with
elixirs of life, and agencies of destruction.
It had recently been announced by him that
he had isolated an alkaloid —“Pallida mors”
he christened it—which was the most
mysterious poison known to the world, leav-
ing no trace which the most experienced
toxicologist could discover. So sinister was
it that he refused to make it known, even to
the scientific world. Odorless, tasteless, the
poison left the body with the life it de-
stroyed. “Its mission is death, not life, he
gave as his reason, and so far as I am con-
cerned it remains undiscovered. But my
tracks are leading me towards the perfection
of an extract from the juices of the same
tree which I hope will be as potent to cure
as this is to destroy.” Perhaps Dr. Potus
was actually hinting at an elixir of life.
When they were seated Dr. Jocelyn asked
the direct question: “Is it true?”
“There’s no use in denying it. now that it
has leaked out here. My grandfather was a
Turkish merchant who in London renounced
his creed and nationality and married an
Englishwoman. The fact of my descent was
well known in London at school, in the
University and in my profession, but it made
no difference. I did not think of disguising
it here until I met you and heard your
views on racial eugencies. What difference
can it make to us? Surely you will not let
it interfere with oilr happiness?”
But there was no mercy in Dr. Jocelyn’s
clear eyes.
“We shall be friends, I hope,” she said,
“but nothing more.”
He pleaded passionately, argued, talked of
love, the ruin of his life, the future which
shone before them, guaranteed by the union
of perfect intellectual gifts as well as bodily
perfections. But, fierily as he spoke, he
failed to melt the ice of Dr. Jocelyn’s deter-
mination.
At a pause in the storm of his eloquence
she remarked: “Shall we leave?”
The coldly uttered question had precisely
the intended" effect. It ended all hope.
With a conspicuously artificial attempt at
composure Dr. Potus said: “As a last rite
over my eugenically slain. hopes, you will
not refuse to join me in a glass of the spark-
ling wine you like best?”
“I should like it very much,” said Dr.
Jocelyn.
When the waiter brought the wine Dr.
Jocelyn arose and walked across the room
to adjust her hat before a mirror. As she
recrossed the room to her chair her vanity-
bag fell to the floor’. Potus saw the bag
drop and left his seat to recover it, and
handed it to her. He lifted his wineglass
and looked at his companion.
“A last glass together,” he said.
“I hope not,” replied Jocelyn, “but if-you
will have it so, a last glass.” They drank
the wine.
They passed from the brilliantly lighted
vestibule to the street, and Dr. Jocelyn en-
tered her car. Outwardly her companion
appeared cool, but his eyes still blazed with
blue fires.
As Dr. Jocelyn was about to start her
machine her companion bent over and said
in a low voice:
“The game is finished. I never took your
eugenic idiocy seriously, and I thought it
was a pose with you. Now I know that you
have no heart. You are one of those fiends
that science sometimes breeds. But I am
a Turk. No other man shall have you.
When you went to the mirror you gave the
opportunity for which I was waiting to drop
some of my alkaloid in your wine. In half
an hour you will be done with playing with
life. Good-bye.”
Dr. Jocelyn showed neither alarm nor sur-
prise at these words. Her face, ordinarily
pale, just now suggested flowers and stars,
for the wine had dyed her cheeks with car-
mine and made her eyes sparkle. She was
strangely unimpressed by this deadly
message.
“When I knew I was dealing with a
Turk as well as a toxicologist, mad with
the primitive savagery of jealousy, I knew
what to expect,” slie said calmly. “Through
the mirror I saw you put the powder in my
glass. I went to the mirror purposely to
watch you. I dropped my bag so that you
would leave the table. You may not know
that the top of these card tables may be
swung round by pressing a button. I swung
the table so that my glass became yours.
You have done with experimenting with
death if what you say about your alkaloid
is true.”
She started her car, leaving Dr. Potus,
his face startlingly white Tinder his red hair,
standing under the arc light on the kerb.

Mortality.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Pan strayed into an orchard,
Piping his way through the dark;
The sap leapt at his coming
And flowers streamed through the bark.
Pan stepped from the meadows,
Before the crowing hours,
Into a naked orchard,
And left an island of flowers.
He wandered back to the meadows;
And it was still the dark.
A small wing shivered by him;
It was a sleepy lark.
And Pan, ah, Pan was happy!
His piping hurt the sky—
Such innocence, such glory!
The crowing hour went by.
The line of the hill grew silver,
And, 10, it was the day!
Pan saw his hoof in the sunlight,
And flung his pipes away.
