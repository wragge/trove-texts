The Red Page
An Australian Masterpiece
Heinemann has reissued Henry Handel
Richardson’s The Getting of Wisdom at
3s. 6d. net! That can be taken as an
exclamation of surprise—that anything so
good should be so cheap. Apparently it is
a book-publishing convention that books,
however good, cannot be reprinted at more
than half the price of current issues, how-
ever bad. On a quality basis this should be
priced as high as any novel published this
year. There is no other Australian story
of school life fit to hold a candle to it,
find very few novels of girls’ school life
at all are fit to perform that traditional
ceremony. Its Ladies’ College, Melbourne,
is not the usual abstract place where girls
are educated. It is as much a reality as its
Miss Gurley—as si iff, as chilling, as pre-
cise. Here is that lady, and every other
one, juvenile or adult, that matters in the
book is as visible:—
“How dare you interrupt me—-when I am speak-
ing ! ’’-—she hissed, punctuating her words • with the
ominous headsbakes and pauses. “The first thing,
Miss, for you to do, will be, to take a course of
lessons in manners. Your present ones, may have
done well enough in the outhouse, to which you have
evidently, belonged. They will not do, here, in the
company, of your betters.’’
To say that the school is like 'that is not
to say that it is inhuman. It could not have
contact with its girls without unbending a
little, and the author’s style, anyway, is too
graceful and charming, her outlook too fresh
not to temper her criticism with the quality
of mercy. To read the novel is to have a
renewed confidence in Australian literature
—even this loud term is no longer loud in
its presence. That the writer has to do her
writing away from Australia is only another
commentary on the stifling atmosphere
created by the self-commissioned guardians
of our morals.
Noel Coward's War Play
There is no hint of mercy in another
admirable piece of criticism, the war-play
Post-Mortem, (Heinemann; ss. net), in which
Noel Coward drops his customary mask of
flippancy and turns to the direct and
savage. His savageness and his victims are
such that I am prepared to wager that, bar
Duncan Macdougall, nobody in Australia
is game to produce it. All those critics who
judge art from the moral point of view would
rise to the attack. Defenders of the church
militant would run shrieking for the censor.
Fat old ex-colonels of transports would. turn
apoplectic at its insults to war. Returned
soldiers who have succeeded in forgetting,
as some in it are depicted as having done,
would become intensely indignant. Pacifists
would read into it a glorification of war,
and all the white-feather brigade of females
would be pained and surprised. There would
seem to be a great many left to accept the
play for what it is, a thoughtful criticism
of the smugness that is preparing the world
for more war. But though their numbers
are comparatively large their powers in
Australia are comparatively nil. It is their
own fault. They are indifferent. They
probably outnumber the morality crusaders
by twenty to one, but if Noel Coward’s play
were banned here the amount of protest
wouldn’t be enough to stir an echo in a
bathroom. As an original achievement the
play suffers from being too much, in part,
an echo of “Journey’s End.” The opening
setting is a corrugated-iron shelter, where
“Journey’s End” more sensibly had a dug-
out. The characters are practically identi-
cal; Babe Robins is merely Raleigh with
the difference that he lives. The one who
is killed is a blend of materialist and ideal-
ist. He is called John Cavan, but his real
name is probably Noel Coward. He is dying
when the first curtain falls. Then, in a suc-
cession of scenes, he is depicted as return-
ing in 1930 and calling on his mother, the
girl who has forgotten her love for him in
the gay life, an ex-comrade of the shelter,
whose bitter war book is about to be
destroyed by the same crowd that would
destroy Cowai’d’s play here, his fatuous
father’s death-and-glory newspaper office, and
a group of ex-comrades who have become
smug and suburban. His mother excepted,
they all disappoint him, and the last scene
is back in the shelter, where he dies. The
thesis is that wars will continue, and Coward
wrote the play to explain why he thinks so.
He will be called a pessimist, I suppose.
But observers with the courage not to be
sentimentalists run that risk.
A Russian Novel
There is more deep and biting criticism;:
and nobler art, in The Dogs, by Ivan
Nashivin (George-Allen and Unwin; Roy-
croft; 7s. 6d.), a
novel capitally
done into English
from the Russian
by an unnamed
translator. The
criticism, unlike a
good deal of Coward's, is impartial and im-
personal. It is levelled at the brutal, alike
in the old Russian social order and in the
beginnings of the new. The writer does
not quite succeed in his apparent intention
of presenting the changing scene in Russia
by detailing its effects on sundiy dogs.
But he does something better. He presents
the changing scene of two Russias, that of
men and that of the dogs. Unlike most who
attempt dog stories, he succeeds because,
though he gives the dogs speech on occasion,
he never tries to make humans of them. He
wins sympathy for them purely as dogs,
and yet raises their drama to a level with
the human. They live, hunt, wander,
commit “infidelities” and generally act as
dogs do. The hunt passages are particu-
larly fine. No one who has ever hunted with
a dog is likely to miss being engaged by
them; and no amount of social argument
could make the necessity for change that
existed in the old Russia more apparent
than it is made by the Grand Duke Nikita’s
despotic and callous pride in his ability
<o flick the eye out of a dog with a whip-
lash during a halt in the hunt. In the same
way nothing could more clearly convey the
red-flaggers’ brutality in the revolution than
the plebeian Peter’s mutilating and hanging
of the dogs whose keeper had once punished
him for neglecting them. Nashivin’s criti-
cism is not; of one social order or the other,
but of the brutal in the Russian character.
The presentation is anything but depressing.
The novel is written from a love of nature
and a love of the beautiful, and there is a
touch of humor that, is not common in
Russian literature.
Yet More War
The war portion of Nashivin’s novel—
interval between the old order and the new
—is' far from complimentary to his country-
men. Nor is the British side handed bou-
quets in the early section of A Martial
Medley: the War of 1914-18 in Fact and
Fiction (Scholartis Press; 10s. 6d. net). I
do not care much for the fiction section
of this otherwise fine book. It seems
to me mostly deliberately sordid, as distinct
from necessarily sordid, which is always
at least defensible. The second section,
“Concerning the True,” is a different story.
It holds articles on rumors at the front,
smells at the front and soldiers’ slang,
written respectively by Stephen Southwold,
John Brophy and Eric Partridge. The last-
named, an authority on slang, implies that
the use of “camouflage” to mean deceit (not
concealment) dates from May 5, 1917, when
Shaw wrote: “I was in khaki by way of
camouflage.” I should have given it an
earlier origin. He also says that the origin
of “oscar” (money) is very obscure. I
do not know how old it is, but as long as
I have heard it it was used as deriving from
Oscar Asclie. rhyming with cash. South-
wold’s article on the strangely neglected
topic of what we used to call furphies—
after, as Partridge nicely puts it, “a relevant
contractor in Melbourne”—deserves to be
expanded into a book, and among the other
good things there is an account of war-
prison life ip Germany that is almost
humble in its simplicity and yet a devastat-
ing document.
A Mighty Hunter
A bright, breezy sort of book for anyone
with a taste for vicarious big-game hunting
is Ra-Tau: Father of Lions, bv Casalis
de Pury (Philip Allan; Angus and Robert-
son; 7s. 6d. net). The “father of lions” is
a talkative queer cuss named Smith, who
is really a father of lion-hunters, and has
stories to tell the first-person narrator that
might make the sceptical change the “lion”
to “lyin’.” But it is all said to be fact.
RED PAGE.
Visit to a Critic
He said I had a splendid style for writ-
ing cablegrams.
I hardly think he meant to say it was
concise, clear (not verbose or adjectival).
Indeed, the sniff of appraisement in the
first half of his sentence warned me of the
bite to follow.
A style, to be a style, ought to have no
apparent style at all. And it is right for a
man to say his say, concisely and clearly—
even cablegrammaticallv—on condition he
doesn’t relapse into the staccato notes of
the machine which dispatches the message.
But it must be his natural expression.
Another author may use adjectives in
such a way that we take them comfortably;

A particular novelist hurls cabbages and
carrion indiscriminately: and he finds a
good market, either because he is not such
a fool as to provide pearls for menu tor
swine; or because he has no pearls to otfei.
Each one to his own taste.
The most palatable, and the most plea-
santly surprising story, or essay, comes from
a simple man, out of his own being and
life.
Test this to discover the truth.
Troops of unconscious charlatans, some
of them blinded by too much light, hang
in our atmosphere—for a reason.
Books, even those of accepted authors,
past or present, are not suited to every
constitution: the reader-writer, with suffi-
cient stomach for one kind of food, fails
at another. His own next book is likely
to prove delirium: like a drunken plough-
man out of his furrow he will have crooked
com.
So, too, with readers who are not writers:
readers alone, or —often as they are
readers-and-talkers.
Consider the words they say; yet do not
wonder though you find good books in
their libraries.
HUGH McCRAE.
Yankee (?) Slang
The poor effete Englishman who laughs
at “Punch” would also have a snigger at
Quentin Pope’s etymology (R.P. 10/6/’3l).
“Swamp, creek, lot [plot of land], canoe,
corn [for maize], cabin and meeting-
house,” Mr. Pope would have us believe, are
examples of American slang which have
brought a new richness to the English lan-
guage. If they are of American origin
they must- have been brought back by the
frost-bitten Norsemen who visited U.S.A. in
the tenth century.
“Cabin” is found as “cabane” in Middle
English, and round about 1440 the current
Collins defined “caban” as Clytylle house.”
“Creek” was spelt “crike” or “cryke” in the
days before the Conquest, but the meaning
hasn’t changed with the spelling. Hengist.
and Horsa called swamps swamps; in fact,
you couldn’t find a more generally-used
Teutonic word. “Swampen” in Low Ger-
man to-day refei’s to the quacking of boggy
ground. The Lollards had their “meeting-
houses”—l never heard of any of them
migrating before the Pilgrim Fathers—and
“lot” was in local use in Devon in days
when the world was still flat.
“Corn” has always been used in English
for the fruit of any cereal. It has that
meaning in the Old English chronicles.
Quentin Pope will no doubt find some refer-
ences in the 0.E.D., if he knows what that
is. In 1558 we find the phrase, “All sorts
of pulse corne as pease, beanes, tares and
fitches.” Englishmen who used “corn”
even in referring to legumes would natu-
rally apply it to maize when they grew
that fruit. That application wouldn’t en-
rich the language. As for “canoe,” that is
no more American slang than “pyjainas”
is Urdu slang, or “kangaroo” Australian,
or “maize” Mexican. When you import a
novelty you naturally import the native
name for it also.
Of Quentin Pope’s other examples,
“balance,” in the sense of bank-balance,
can be traced back—entirely in the English
language—to the Elizabethan Pitman who
spoke of the balance of credits over debits
in his book-keeping textbook; “bluff,” in
the sense of a steep bank, was in common
use among the Dutch in the fourteenth
century, though they misspelt it “blaff.”
Spelt “blough” it made its first appearance
in English literature under the guidance
of one Franck in 1658. “Governmental”
the Americans are welcome to. It’s ugly
and useless, but apart from that it doesn’t
sound much like slang.
Shakspeare and the rest of those Mermaid
Tavern clubmen were full of anachronisms.
If Q.P. reads them he’ll find that they used
modem American slang words by the
bucketful.
TAC. W.
A Satchel of Books
Welcome to All This, by D. B. Wyndham
Lewis (Methuen; ss. net). The breezy
columnist’s latest collection of London “Daily
Mail” essay-skits, in which he touches off
many aspects of the current scene to a nicety.
To be taken in small doses in order to avoid
a somewhat artificial taste.
West Australian Orchids, by Emily 11.
Pelloe (illustrated and published by the
author; 7s. 6d.). A gladsome little book for
the lover of Australian flowers. There are
more than 130 species of orchids in West-
ralia, and this expert in them describes and
pictures all the more important ones.
Idol Worship, by E. W. Savi (Hutchin-
son; 7s. 6d. net). Fortune favors the brave,
the weak and fearful go under, virtue is its
own reward and Fate provides a happy
ending. “Chums” and “The Girl’s Own
Annual” for adults.
Every man’s Encyclopaedia (Dent; ss. fid.
net per vol.). Judged by the first two
volumes this new encyclopaedia is to be as
good as anything issued under the name of
Everyman. There will be 12 vols.; the size
is handy and the articles are well written,
even to the extent of being breezy. Anyone
in search of a comparatively inexpensive
encyclopaedia could not possibly do better.
Letters from a Modern Daughter to Her
Mother, by Pamela Frankau (Hurst and
Blackett; 7s. 6d. net). A series of 13 letters
in the style of the Melbourne Office Flapper-
relating the cocktail and other such adven-
tures and experiences of a modernish miss,
with Men much in the foreground. Breezy
flippancies with the ring of truth, and the
old, old love story threaded through.
Famous Sea Fights from Salamis to Jut-
land, by John Richard Hale (Methuen;
7s. 6d. net). As embracing as the title sug-
gests and crammed with good story well told.
This, the seventh, edition retains the original
pictures and maps, with additional chapters
describing the battles of Coronel, Falklands
and Jutland.
The Sophisticates . by Gertrude Atherton
(Chapman and Hall; 7s. 6d. net). Murder
mystery nicely used as a medium for revealing
character., A Mrs. Abbey, leader of the high-
brow set in a United States town, escapes
a charge of having murdered her aged hus-
band when one of her young admirers makes
a deathbed confession. She returns and con-
tinues to lead the set, scarcely a member of
which believed the confession. Against that
attitude her character is steadily revealed,
and with that goes a convincingly created
atmosphere of city-aping provincialism. The
novel is so much more a literary job than the
avei’age thriller that keeping the secret of
who did commit the murder till near the
end seems like a concession to flapperdom.
The History of the First Battalion
( A.1.F. ), by Col. Ivindon, D.S.O. (ss. ; pub-
lished by the author), has a foreword by Sir
Nevill Smyth, V.C., in which it is commended
“to every Australian, young or old, rich or
poor.” It is indeed an inspiring story.
Between November 9, 1914, when the Sydney,
which had been guarding the port side of the
first Australian convoy, rushed off to Cocos
Island in pursuit of the Emden, and the
Armistice the battalion saw every aspect of
the war that it was possible for Australian
infantrymen to see. If any one section of the
book is more enthralling than another it is
that which deals with Gallipoli between the
Landing and the beginning of the wet weather
that preceded the Evacuation. But there are
several other fine chapters, and notably the
one on the Third Battle of Ypres. The
photographs are admirable, and there is a
complete nominal roll of the battalion.
11. M. E. Clamp’.s The Power and Glory
Girl (Hurst and Blackett; 7s. 6d. net) re-
surrects a set of characters who were popu-
lar when Surrey-side bellowdrama was in
its power and glory. There is Stora Mount-
less (“sponsored by the gods; they had
dowered her with beauty, wealth, rank,
purple and fine linen”), who is made unhappy
by the scoundrelly but all too alluring Major
Valour liineheart until the Rev. Garrick, a
saintly slum parson, wins her poor little
rich girl’s heart. Also, Florry Ann, a Coster
fiah’r gel, who loves the parson and dies
opportunely of consumption; and the poison l
ously lovely Virginia (she has left Valour
for a millionaire Hebrew who calls her “my
brecious,” and is always referred to as “the
old baboon”) and some stock dowagers. The
story may charm the outer suburbs of Lon-
don to a sniff or two, but why it should
have been imported to’ Australia is one of
the mysteries of the local book trade.

MERCHANDISE.
I stood within the market-place
Where merchants cry: I saw yonr face,
O priceless jewel, your merchandise!
To bargain for your lips and eyes
I offer you this rose, this pearl,
This sword, this arm,
O mountain girl!
What cedar-shrouded, silver pool
Has drenched thy limbs? What amber light
Has touched thy bosom? And what night
Has given thy hair its starry light?
I was a king; I am thy fool,
My squadrons driven from the tight.
Against the regiments I had
Thy charms have armed a myriad
Sweet enemies, sweet wounding lances;
I yield my city to thy glances.
I stood where merchants chaff and cry,
And idly watched the passers-by,
And then thou passed! What merchant
haste
Need thou to sell thy jars, thy paste
Of apricots?
Bend down thy lips:
I will buy kisses with my ships
And all their cargoes, cinnamon,
And dark, rich spices of the sun,
And tragacanth and nard and myrrh,
Olibanum, jacinth, jasper,
Orris, cashmere and brocade,
Ambergris and musk and jade,
Beryls, opals, tourmalines,
The profits of the sapphire mines,
Gathered beyond the - furthest capes.
The sailor, wonder-seeing, shapes
His venturous courses by strange stars,
Ere, laden from the Malabars,
The Coasts of Ivory or of Gold,
The ships return. A thousand-fold
My treasure grows.
What wealth have I,
If thou, sweet merchant, will not buy?
Oh, give me charter, mountain maid,
And put thy riches out to trade!

But when his father saw afar off that his son had not cut out his old associates, he said “Nothing doing,” and went on with his private affairs.

WE MUST GET TO WORK.
The dole in its present form is doomed:
if it isn’t, we are. There is no magic well
from which we can draw pounds, shillings
and pence: we can have no more than we
dig out of the earth and dredge out of the
sea.
In Britain no doubt there is such a well.
The Old Man is still one of the great
creditors of the world. The wealth of some
of his people is prodigious: great tracts of
crowded London and the half of some large
country towns are owned by dukes and
other not always inferior people. In Aus-
tralia there are a mere handful of even
comparatively rich people; and 95 per cent,
of them are in business of some sort or
another. The great difference between the
two lots of rich or comparatively rich, the
British and the Australian, is that, whereas
the former either spend their money lavishly
or invest it in British and foreign loans,
four-fifths of the incomes of the richer Aus-
tralians is re-employed in the sort of busi-
ness which produced them. In many cases
the profit or so-called profit is never seen.
Indeed, it never exists in the shape of
money, but consists of farm and station
improvements, additions to flocks and areas
under crop, additions to plant and
machinery and merchandise and book debts
and factory and other buildings. The dole
can be drawn out of the stored-up wealth
of Britain without doing any tremendous
damage, except to those who receive it; it
cannot be paid out of the stored-up wealth
of Australia because for all practical pur-
poses there is none that is liquid. And it
cannot be drawn out of current earnings
without putting a stop to improvements and
extensions of factory and other industry.
Indeed, in many cases it cannot be drawn
without bringing the wheels of industry to
a full stop. Britain may have the dole as a
semi-permanent institution. Perhaps after
a thousand years of accumulating, Aus-
tralia could, too. At present it is physically
impossible.
Thus far we have carried on by “piling up
deficits,” as it is called. But that expres-
sion merely hides the fact. A Government
which pays its debts cannot pile up a
deficit without borrowing the money; and
as a country which makes deficits a habit
cannot get voluntary loans, it has to get
forced loans. Practically all Australia, Com-
monwealth and States, has been financed by
such loans for two years past, with the
result that to-day the greatest of our
raving banks is a wreck, and the other
banks are squeezed so dry they cannot give
industry the assistance it specially needs at
such a time as this. As for taxation,
already it is consuming most of the profit
which ought to be used for the sup-
port and expansion of industry, with the
twofold result that the taxable field is
reduced and the unemployment distress
which calls for relief is increased.
Men are “demanding” this and that from
our Governments. In most cases it will
be found that they are immigrants of
one sort or another, unaware of the
conditions of a new country, unaware that
here there is no deep pocket of accumu-
lated savings to be rifled; and where
they are not immigrants they are under
the influence of immigrants whose worst
offence is that the less they know the
more cocksure they are and the more talka-
tive.
So the dole is doomed. Lang in X. S.
Wales has been able to keep it going in the
past only by refusing to pay his debts; and
he insists that in order to keep it going
in the future he must get more loans from
the other States, all of them far poorer
than N. S. Wales, and desperately hard up,
some of them. Most obviously the break-
ing point has been reached.
And Avhat then? No doubt by rioting
and looting some at least of the unem-
ployed could get food to eat and clothes to
wear. But there would be bloodshed; there
would be shameful waste; and the women
and children would gain nothing and suffer
infinitely more than they do to-day. Let
there be no mistake about it, we are moving
towards such things. There are those who
believe that we are being deliberately
pushed—that out of the turmoil and the
offering, out of the blood and the ashes,
a few men hope to snatch a soviet republic.
But whether we are drifting or being
pushed, there is not the shadow of a doubt
as to what is ahead of us unless we take
steps to create something that will take
the place of the dole.
There is room, of course, for a large exten-
sion of factory employment in Australia,
and the farms of Australia should absorb
many; but when all is done in that way that
it is possible to do quickly, we shall be left
with at least 100,000 men. These are mostly
people who were previously employed
on loan undertakings or in jobs, largely
parasitic, which sprang out of the borrow-
ing boom. Many of them possess high
qualifications: they include engineers, archi-
tects, contractors and builders, as well as
chemists, motor and other mechanics, most
varieties of tradesmen and accountants,
salesmen and clerks. Not only are they out
of a job: for many of them all hope of a
job of the sort they had is gone for years
to come.
There is only one thing for these men;
and, after all, it is the most natural thing
in the world—to go back on to the land
and make it yield a living. How to get,
say, 100,000 of them on the land, so
that they may as soon as possible maintain
themselves instead of waiting for the
inevitable collapse of the dole—this is the
largest practical question which faces us
to-day. It inevitably must be a matter of
organisation. One here and there has
already pitched his camp somewhere and
set to work to grow something; but there
is small hope that way. For one thing,
the great majority of men cannot tide over
the weeks before anything they do can bear
fruit; and most of them have not the
means to furnish themselves with tents or
huts, tools, seeds and domestic animals.
And more than that must be arranged.
The tragic position at which we have
arrived is that many men now refuse to
accept any sort of job because the dole plus
private charity pays them better. To meet
that, the dole ought to be made a disappear-
ing quantity; as a dole it should be en-
tirely gone in 12 months’ time, the money
saved subsidising those who had tackled
work of some kind. More, those who under-
take to leave the cities and dig their living-
out of the land should be under no handicap
so far as employment or re-employment
in other industries is concerned. On the
contrary, employers ought to enter into a
compact to take only men who could furnish
proof of having made an effort to maintain
themselves. If men could be assured that
the quickest way to get employment in a
city factory or store or anywhere else was to
go temporarily on to the land and try to
get a living out of it, the strongest objec-
tion to leaving the city would be answered.
Whatever other considerations may arise,
however, these two facts must be kept in
the forefront: the continuance of the dole
is in very great danger; yet if it breaks
down without anything having been organ-
ised to take its place, there will be not only
terrible distress but very terrible other
things.
TOP-HEAVY EDUCATION.
A committee in S. Australia has reported
to Parliament that it is possible to make
economies in the expenditure on education.
It attacks the problem top and bottom. It
recommends the closing of 154 schools with
an average attendance of less than 10; and
if it should be decided that schools should
be closed where there is an average attend-
ance of less than 12, then 94 others would
disappear. And it advises the amalgamation
of high schools (of the whole 29 only 10
have a daily average attendance of 100 h
and recommends that fees be charged at
technical, higher primary and high schools,
with certain provisions for meeting cases
of special aptitude. The fees suggested are
in no case more than one-half cost.
The difficulty in which S. Australia finds
itself is common to every State; and in
most of them the cost of education is at
last getting the cold eye. In N. S. Wales
the Government has taken the proper course
of preparing to cut out a curious anomaly
to which The Bulletin has often called
attention, the annual grant to Sydney
Grammar School, And in Tasmania it is
proposed to reimpose high school fees.
■You can’t educate a child like you can
boil a kettle: there is, that is to say, no
precise point at which you can leave off
and say the job is done. In practice, how-
ever, there is a point where the State must
leave off; but where that point is only the
circumstances of the time can determine.
Hitherto we have professed to have so much
regard for the children that we have done
this and that for them—and then have
loaded them with the bills. The question
we now have to ask ourselves is, What
education can we give the young without
being the canting humbugs and hypocrites
we have been in the past? In short, what
education can we give the young and
honestly pay for it ourselves?
The cost of government, including social
services, has of late years grown prodigi-
ously. In 1901 the net cost per scholar in
average attendance at the State schools
in Australia was £4 9s. 3d.; in 1928 it was
no less than £l4 15s. lid. But this has to
be said: in the earlier years and for some
time afterwards the salaries of teachers were
disgracefully low. An increase was Jong
overdue; and even to-dav there is less .room
for cuts in this Department than in almost
any other branch of the service. Free edu-
cation was indeed introduced and for years
earned on at the expense of scandalously
sweated staffs; and even then the bills were
not always paid—school buildings were added
to our “permanent and reproductive under-
takings,” and an lOU was signed for the
child to pay. To some extent we have got
rid of the sweating; but public services, in-
cluding the schools, in N. S. Wales alone can
show a deficit of 11 millions, and a deficit
still simply means putting the bill by for
the child to pay.
Still, though so obviously something has
to be done, it is with difficulty that The
Bulletin brings itself to say one word in
favor of the closing of small schools. The
people who live in the country are so
heavily handicapped that they cannot afford
to yield a single advantage they have got.
Yet it comes to this, that there is no
special virtue about an average attendance
of 10. If 10, why not nine—or eight? What
is possible at one time, as we have said,
is impossible at others. For the time being,
then, the very small school may have to.go;
if it does it is to be hoped its place will
be taken by sympathetic personal corre-
spondence and by correspondence lessons
of the highest possible character. Less
compunction need be felt about economies
at the other end. It is doubtful whether
the secondary schools are justifying them-
selves. There seems to be much truth in
the gibe that they are turning too many
people best fitted by nature to be happy
tradesmen and farmers into unhappy clerks
and accountants and doctors—and perhaps
professors. The system formerly employed
in N. S. Wales, in the days before we
damned the expense and went ahead, was
very near the ideal. To the child above
the average in either mental capacity or
the capacity for work the high school was
always open : to others the high school was
available at a fee. Especially at a time
like the present there is no obligation on
the people to provide more than that.
THE BIG SICK BABY AT MOSCOW.
Though the alleged republic at Moscow is
within a few months of its 14th birthday,
it is still much too soon to talk of it as a
success that has come to stay. It is always
changing. In its early days its boss madmen
aimed at an impossible ideal; under their
rule a peasant couldn’t* legally sell an egg
to a customer direct—the transaction had
to go through a department of State.
Owing to the department’s- natural incom-
petence, often the egg went bad, or was lost,
or the money was lost, or payment was in-
definitely delayed, and an enormous system
of bootlegging grew up almost in a night. So
did an enormous system of espionage, and
the informer flourished exceedingly. Next
there emerged from somewhere the New
Economic Plan, and a limited amount of
Private Enterprise began to be permitted.
Presently the New Economic Plan dropped
down an unspecified hole, and towards the
end of 1928 it was succeeded by the Five-
year Plan, which aimed at . the forcible
conversion of Russia, inside 60 months, from
its old character of a land which specialised
in animals, grain, minerals and timber into
the greatest and most efficient manufactur-
ing country on earth. The nominally self-
governing people woke one morning and
found that the new shock had come upon
them, and they don’t know to this day
where it came from.
The Five Years have more than half ex-
pired and a cold feeling already super-
venes. The basis of the Bolshevik religion
is that the private soldier of industry is
to rank highest, and that the officer—-the
man who knows how to do things—is to
come last. He is ill-paid provided he can be
found at all, and he lives under constant
suspicion of being a “counter-revolutionary”
in a land where suspicion is apt to be fatal.
By a recent decree the employer of labor
or the person engaged in trade can have a
vote if he can produce a certificate from the
local workshop committee, or peasant
organisation, or trades union organisation
that he doesn’t profit by the things he does.
The fact that the private employer and
trader exist and are recognised as being alive
and out of gaol shows how far the republic
has already fallen away from its blood-
stained purity. There is also an increasing-
tendency to grant “concessions” to foreign
Private Enterprise, which brings in decently-
paid experts, who remain foreign so as to
dodge, as far as possible, the disadvantages
of Russian law.
Ihe present boss man of the . republic
is Stalin, Lenin being dead and Trotsky an
affluent and hated exile. Stalin, like his
predecessors, wasn’t exactly elected, but he
happened and then he stayed. He has
issued a statement whose general .meaning
is that the industrial expert can’t be done
without if the Russian factories are to pro-
duce goods of competitive value, that
reliable political opinions are no guarantee
of good workmanship, that the local expert
won’t flourish in an ambitious way 'if there
is no reward in sight, and that it is worse
than useless, to kill off Russian Private
Enterprise if it is to be replaced by the
foreign article. Stalin’s view is that the
Russian industrial expert should have a
better reward and a wholly different status,
so that the rank-and-file worker may haye a
prospect before him to lift him out of the
dull, drab bog ,of equality and “class con-
sciousness.”
So another Plan is obviously incubating,
adding further proof to what was apparent
already—that Bolshevism is no fixed
scheme of reform, but a hurried and swiftly-
revolving dream.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Fall of Man.
The real fall of man began when somebody
borrowed to pay for something he hadn’t
the money to buy. It was probably quite
a good purchase, and to that extent the
boirowing was justified; but its very excel-
lences led on to a ruinous bloating of
the practice. Perhaps half the financial
ills of the world can be charged to it; more
than half the present depression certainly
can.
All the world over thoughtful writers are
blaming the Great War for the present
world disturbance of finance and industry;
and they are doing well—you can’t kick
war too often and in too many places.
But there were great waves of depression
before the war. Coghlan, in his “Seven
Colonies” (1900), took the 1870-74 prices
of our exports as = 1000, and showed that
whereas in 1862 the index number was
1310, by 1870 it had fallen to 879. In 1882
it was back to 926; by 1894 it was down
to 532. Thereafter there was a steady rise,
and by 1899 it was 736—an increase that
time of 38 per cent, in four years. And
there was a further increase from 1000 in
1901 to 1290 in 1913.
It is true that the war had tremendous
consequences, sending the price index-
figure of our exports from 1290 in 1913 to
2254 in 1920-21. But it was one of the
war’s foul brood, a wild burst of credit,
which was mainly responsible for that
violent upward movement, just as credit
had been responsible for previous upward
movements, and as its collapse had been
responsible for their collapse. Admittedly
the high prices in the earlier ’sixties were
based not wholly on credit : there was the
substantial backing in those days of the
“diggings” gold. Yet that gold had more
of the qualities of credit than of gold.
It was often just as easily come by; and
always, it was believed, there was plenty
more where it was got. That is the
chief curse of credit: it destroys the proper
appreciation of money, so that ridiculous
prices may be charged. In that way fic-
titious values are created, to end when men
come to their senses.
There is a good deal of talk to-day about
stabilisation. There could be no better
thing for the world. It is shocking that
a man should borrow the equal of one bale
of wool this year and through a change in
the purchasing power of gold should have to
pay. 2-} bales a few years hence. But at
what point are we going to stabilise? No-
body suggests that we should do it at the:
low prices; always it is the fictitious prices,
the result of almost unrestricted credit,
which it is desired to maintain. The ques-
tion is whether that can be done; or, if it
can be done, whether it would be wise
to do it. Certainly in our own case we
shall have to realise that the standards
set up during the past few years
were fictitious, being built largely on credit ;
and the credit was so wild that we have
now decided we must write off some of the
debt, or the interest on the debt, which is
the same thing.
But perhaps the quaintest feature of the
whole case is that loudest among those
who are denouncing any attempt to lower
the standards of pay or living are those
who declare that we can never meet the
bills we incurred in establishing those stan-
dards, and shouldn’t try to. This is the
same as saying that the clothes we bought
and didn’t pay for last year were far too
expensive, for our purse, that we shouldn’t
be expected to pay for them and won’t,
but that we nevertheless like them so much
we are going to order the same sort of
clothes in the future. It is very high-
spirited and all that, of course; but it isn’t
honest.
. ♦
The Banks’ Interest Rates.
Newspapers are doing the banks the very
great disservice of explaining at vast
length every few days why the interest on
advances cannot yet be reduced. It would
be unreasonable, the apologists point out,
to expect banks to reduce interest when
they themselves have to pay a high rate
on some deposits for the next two years.
But as The Bulletin has tried to show,
these institutions are not —in Australia,
anyhow— great soulless concerns without a
thought except of the last penny they can
squeeze out of the public. For the most
part they consist of small investors who
have put the provision for their own old
age or for the maintenance of their widow
and children into the safe-keeping of cer-
tain directors; and in a crisis like the
present the most we can ask of these direc-
tors is that they make a compromise
between the country’s interests and those
of the shareholders.
The directors of the Commonwealth Bank
are in a different position. They have no
shareholders depending upon them: not a
family in all Australia will go short of
a meal if they reduce their interest so low
that they do not show a penny of profit
this year. It is not at all surprising, there-
fore, that the Commonwealth Bank should
have outpaced the others in the matter of
interest-reduction on advances. But the
public need have no doubt that an an-
nouncement on the part of the others will
be forthcoming very soon.


The Savings Bank.
John T. Lang seemed to be quite sur-
prised at the seriousness with which the
Commonwealth Bank approached the busi-
ness of “taking over” the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Savings Bank. Surely this was a
very small matter: little more than pulling
down one sign and putting up another! Yet
here were these fellows, Gibson and the
others, making a fuss about it as if it were
a thing of great consequence. “Had the
Premier received the proposals of the Com-
monwealth Bank?” Lang was asked in the
House one day. “I believe a bundle of
papers did come in,” the Hon. the Treasurer
replied in effect. “But I didn’t look at
them. I minuted them on to the Treasury
clerks.” Such an attitude explains why
the board, its patience exhausted, eventu-
ally gave Mr. Lang notice that the whole
thing was off unless there was a reply at
the week-end.
Of course to this board the matter is one
of great importance. It is not merely a
taking over of deposits; it is a taking over
of liabilities—and pledging the resources
of the Commonwealth Bank to meet them.
Money to these men is something not got
by turning the tax screw. To them the
deposits in their charge represent years of
toil and self-denial on the part of hundreds
of thousands of poor people; and, casually
as Mr. Lang might dip into the coffers of
the Government Savings Bank, these men
are not going to let anybody dip casually
into the funds of which they are the trus-
tees.
It is to be deeply regretted that the
depositors in the N.S.W. Savings Bank must
pay for Mr. Lang’s political roguery. But
they, in common with the rest of N. S.
Wales, put Mr. Lang where he is; and as
business men, charged with the safety of the
Commonwealth Bank, the directors had
to accept him and appraise the risks accord-
ingly. They had to take into account the
famous “Plan,” under which it is proposed
to cut down interest on all loans raised by
the Government to 3 per cent. —and the
N.SW. Government is this bank’s heaviest
creditor. They had to take into account
the fact that the Government had already
failed to pay interest due to this bank, and
was heaping up such deficits that further
defaults were probable. How could any
outside bank take over the huge liabilities
without imposing conditions which would
be staggering if they were proposed in any
other circumstances? It is all part of the
terrific price we have to pay for Mr. Lang.
♦
The Lang Plan in South Aus.
Outside N. S. Wales South Australia has
the honor of returning the first Lang Plan
candidate to Parliament: he takes the place
of the gentleman who has gone to gaol for
a few years to expiate an abominable
offence. Which is morally the worse, the
Lang Plan or the Edwards Practice, is
scarcely worth arguing. They are both
evidences of depravity. As the A.W.U.
declared as soon as Lang had liberated his
precious policy, it was no plan at all: it was
mere highway robbery wearing a ridiculous
frill. There is no word in it about economy;
no word about the need to live within our
means; no word about speeding up produc-
tion. It consists of three sections: two
of them advocate dishonesty and theft;
the third proposes to do away with gold
and substitute a goods standard, and that is
just as much within the control of a poor
little Australian State Government as the sun
and moon and stars are. There was a time
when S. Australia was justly proud of its
commonsense and uprightness. To-day
it lays the foundations of a party whose
purpose is to make theft the public policy.
It is time its people woke up.
Year by year it becomes more and more
evident that we have not been careful
enough with the Parliamentary franchise.
No test of character is applied; so long as
the most notorious criminal in a State is
not in gaol at the moment, his vote is as
good as anyone’s. For making a habit of
crime a man or woman may, in most places,
be given an indeterminate sentence,: the
law never dreams of saying that a thrice-
convicted rogue shall not be trusted with
a vote. And there is no educational test
whatever, not even as to the newly-arrived
immigrant, though he be but a wisp of old-
world prejudices and hatreds and utterly
ignorant of Australian conditions.
In that awakening of the native-born
which surely is not far distant, many things
will be due for a change; and this will be
among the first of them. Meantime we
shall continue to elect gentlemen who are
presently found guilty of abominable prac-
tices and, as their successors, other gentle-
men who back the Lang Swindle.

Legislation by People Who Don’t Know.
From a N. S. Wales lawyer with a large
country practice:—
It is becoming an axiom that Labor legislation
benefits almost anybody but the working man. Take,
for instance, the recent Act abolishing distress for
rent. I am prepared to believe that its framers
meant it to be humanitarian, and' I distinctly re-
member the sob-stuff that was loosed in Parliament
about the rapacious landlord, and the tenant’s “few
sticks” and the rest of it. In practice, when the
tenant had only a few sticks, no landlord went to
the trouble and expense of distraining, for the sordid
reason that it cost more than it was worth.
There is another feature, however. Within the past
week'l have had three landlords in my office seek-
ing advice. A is the owner of a small pub
(incidentally, all liis savings went into it). The
tenant has paid no rent for 12 months, and, as the
furniture and effects are all mortgaged to one of
the big breweries, there is nothing to be gained by
suing, and by law we can’t distrain. Twelve months
ago I should just have written a letter to the
brewery concerned, and the rent would have been
paid by return post—they had to, to protect their
security. Actually the tenant is no better off, but
the brewery’s secui-ity is improved to the extent of
£2OB per annum. B is the widow of a grazier,
and has a life-interest in the property. The whole
of her tenant’s sheep and movable assets are mort-
gaged to one of the big wool firms, and as . we can’t
distrain and the firm won’t pay the rent, their .
security is to that extent better. C is a common or
garden houseowner, and everything in a house he
owns is the property of his tenant’s hire-purchase
merchant. In each of these cases, the tenant is
no better off, the landlord is a whole lot worse off,
and the only beneficiary is the mortgagee-company.
And it must be remembered that these companies,
which have been doing the same class of business for
years, have already made provision for their bad
debts, so that the new statutory protection they get
is all bunce.
As every practising lawyer knows, the law is the
product of the accumulated wisdom and hard experi-
ence of centuries; and when the smart young pupils
of the debating club stick a sprag into it, the result
is apt to surprise all hands.

Is Australia Over-governed?
Dear Bulletin, — Australia is remarkable
for the fact that it has a record scarcity of
Parliaments and Governments in propor-
tion to its area, and a considerable scarcity
of them in proportion to its population.
Most Australians one meets in the street or
holding forth on the platform are prepared
to swear that our Commonwealth is a sort
of baby miracle in the way of over-govern-
ment, but that only signifies that their cap-
acity for being misled amounts to genius.
The following list, which covers six English-
speaking countries and three others, has
some bearing on the case. The number of
Parliaments includes the Federal one where
it exists:—
Average
Number Area per Inhabitants
of Legis- Legislature per
latures. (Sq. Miles). Legislature.
Australia . . . . 7 425,000 925,000
Canada .. .. 11 319,100 903,100
Brazil . . .. 21 156,000 ' 489,000
Maoriland .. 1 103,722 1,344,469
Argentina . . .. 15 76,900 746,400
United States .. 49 60,700 2,505,000
Newfoundland . . 1 42,734 266,401
British Isles 6 20,271 8,133,000
Switzerland .. 26 614 156,500
So our Commonwealth has the smallest
number of Legislatures among nine com-
pared with area, and the smallest number
among six compared with population. And
the list might be extended to six times the
length and yet the lesson would remain the
same. The Australian States are ridicu-
lously large on the average to be efficiently
administered from one State centre, accord-
ing to the opinion of people who have, in
most cases, been much longer at the business
than we have. There remains the state-
ment that the people of Australia, alone
among nations, are so incapable or dis-
honest that the cost of ordinary self-govern-
ment, even on this restricted scale, is
beyond their capacity to pay. But, if they
are so stupid as all that amounts to, it isn’t
likely the wild experiment of unification and
trying to manage a whole continent from
Canberra will make them any wiser.—
Yours etc., Solomon Malaprop.

Libelling the R.A.N.
A former naval staff officer has been putting
forward reasons why Australia should “save
£2.000,000 a year by handing over its sea
defence to Britain”:
Within ten days’ steam of our coasts there is
harbored the third most powerful navy in the world.
And to cope with it we have but two obsolete
cruisers. A trite saying of the late Admiral “Jacky”
Fisher might well be applied to the position of Aus-
tralian naval defence: “We can neither fight nor run
away.”
A recent article began with a mis-state-
ment:—
The right was grudgingly granted by the British
Government to the Australian Commonwealth to
defend its challenging policy of a “White Australia”
with its own ships and its own sailors.
The historical truth is that the Admiralty
favored the R.A.N. from the first, as it
has favored and encouraged all Dominions
navies on Imperial policy grounds. Lord
Dudley was sent here as Governor-General
in 1908 with express orders to counteract
the misguided propaganda of our Tories
which aimed at preserving the subsidised
R.N. squadron; and ever since the warmest
commendations of the R.A.N. have come
from the Admiralty, and from such authori-
ties as Rear-Admiral Evans. The Admiralty
knew what it was about 20-odd years ago.
If the Commonwealth had declared then for
the policy which is now recommended to
us, its coastal cities would have been bom-
barded, A.I.F. transports sunk, and vast
damage done to the Empire’s sea-borne
trade between here and Ceylon.
A charge that the Australia and Canberra
are obsolete is as disingenuous as the other.
In a sense, every man-o’-war is obsolete by
the time it is put in commission; meaning
that it embodies the ideas of five years
previously, when it was conceived. There
will be only two men-o’-war afloat by the
end of this year that aren’t “obsolete”—
Germany’s pocket battleships, which are
scaring the French so badly.
Admiral Fisher’s actual words were “Too
weak to fight, too slow to run away,” and
they were applied not to the R.A.N. but
to the R.N. squadron which the R.A.N.
displaced.
The Commonwealth would save nothing
by subsidising a British squadron unless it
decided to have a dirt-cheap, whiqfi is to
say an inefficient, one. An inefficient squad-
ron would result in Australia being isolated,
and perhaps bankrupted, shortly after the
outbreak of a war in which the Empire
was engaged. An efficient one would con-
tain cruisers like our own—which are, in
effect, the capital ships of to-day—and
would cost virtually as much as we are
paying now. As against this, Australia,
would lose what the R.A.N. was established
to bring into being and perpetuate—its sea
sense.

Labor Costs of Wool Production.
Dear Bulletin, —You say (B. 15/7/’31):
“No tax on home consumption could make
an appreciable difference to the price the
woolgrower would get for his exports.”
Granted. “But,” you add, “against that
has to be set the fact that the labor cost
in wool production is almost negligible.”
Here are a few figures based on my own
actual costs in my endeavor to help pay
Brown in London: —
Proceeds
Year. Sheep shorn. paid Bank.
1926-27 .. 8518 £5290
1930-31 . . 6057 1495
From which have to be deducted the fol-
lowing “negligible labor costs”:—
Rail
Year. Shearing. Wages, and Droving.
1926-27 .. £530 £llBB £B7
1930-31 . . 326 500 153
I won’t bother you with such items as
assessments, insurance, carriage, interest,
repairs and maintenance, stores, etc.; but
when they are added to the “negligible
labor costs,” Lang’s ss. in the £ tax has
no terror for me. —Yours, A. H. S.
The Second Chamber in Queensland.
The Moore Government in Queensland is
being far too casual over the Leg. Council.
The present Assembly is in its last session;
yet Ministers had no scheme ready for sub-
mission when they met the House: they
even hint that there may be no Second
Chamber when the next Parliament meets.
The Theodore Government deserved all
the censure heaped upon it for cutting out
the second Chamber in the face of a refer-
endum which declared in favor of one. But
if the Theodore Government was wrong in
abolishing the second Chamber in the teeth
of that referendum, how can the Moore
Government be right in continuing to
govern without it? After all, was it much
worse to sweep the Chamber away than it
is to keep it swept away? One of the first
things the new Government should have
done was to honor the referendum and
restore the Council. It will be a grave
neglect of its obligations if it allows the
present session to run out without repairing
the damage so insolently done by its prede-
cessors.

Military or Martial Law?
Dear Bulletin, —“Slinga’s” quibble (B.
8./7/’3l) that “members of the A.1.F., as
such, never came under martial law” re-
calls a cable of a few weeks back:—
In reference to Lord Beaverbrook’s story, related
in the “Daily Express,” of the late Lord Birken-
head’s arrest behind the British lines in 1916.
General Sir Nevil Macready states that Lord Birken-
head was not arrested, but was brought back to
general headquarters.
Lord Birkenhead, who should have known,
told Parliament he had been arrested, and
the Diggers had equally good reasons
to know they were under martial law
in parts of Flanders and Palestine. On
the Ypres sector there was no civilian
authority whatsoever—not so much as a
gendarme, much less a civilian court or
magistrate. Town majors controlled sol-
diers and civilians alike. It was the same
on the Somme, and, I understand from
Light Horsemen, in Palestine. How absurd,
in the circumstances, to suggest that we
were merely under “military law”—“the
code which regulates the conduct of soldiers,
as such, but does not apply to civilians”!
In any case, the Flanders area was under a
declared “etat de siege” of which Dicey
says (“Martial Law”): —
We shall hardly go far wrong if we assume that
during this suspension of ordinary law any man
whatever is liable to arrest, imprisonment or execu-
tion at the will of a military tribunal.
And a war-time spy or rebel who relied
on the fact that British soldiers would be
acting illegally if they shot him would
crash as badly as a peace-time murderer
who relied on eluding the hangman because
in English law executions have to be vali-
dated by a coroner’s jury. Lody was a
civilian, yet a military firing-party shot him
within a mile of the Old Bailey. Admit-
tedly in the U.K. the civil courts continued
to function. To that extent no part of
Britain was ever under martial law. But
civilians had a bad time who failed to recog-
nise that the military were, in fact, supreme.
It always happens, and always will, when a
nation is in danger, however theorists may
try to explain it away. — Yours, 2nd Divvy.
Concerning- Cabbages.
Just upon a century ago the Buffalo
anchored in Holdfast Bay, in what is now
South Australia, and was followed presently
by other tiny vessels sent out by the Coloni-
sation Society. The country to be settled
had not even been closely explored; and the
settlers had the most limited means—a few
tools, some seeds, stores to last a few
months. The Adelaide plains on which they
camped are fertile but poorly watered;
nevertheless the settlement grew and
thrived, and out of it sprang the city of
Adelaide and one of the most solidly-
prosperous communities in Australia.
There are a hundred available places in
Australia where settlement would be
infinitely easier and success surer. But we
are making no use of them; we don’t even
seem to begin to realise that we need to
make use of them. They were not neces-
sary before: why should they be necessary
in future? We shall make no real progress
out of our bog until we realise that this
is a new world we are living in; until we
realise that we fell into our bog by neglect-
ing production and trying to live on one
another. We will have to get back to the
idea of depending on ourselves, just as
those early Adelaide settlers did. Within
a few weeks they were living largely on
their own produce; to-day a similar com-
munity, provided as it certainly would be
with cows and fowls and pigs, would find
the living infinitely easier.
Our great misfortune is that in too many
places we have Ministers in office who will
do nothing to promote such schemes be-
cause they can be made to look like an
attack on the basic wage and the standard
of living. But idleness and non-production
are the worst enemies the basic wage and
the standard of living can possibly have.
In the aggregate the countiy cannot pay
more than it produces. If a farm grows
10,000 bags of wheat it can distribute the
value of 10,000 bags of wheat. If it grows
only 5000 bags it cannot distribute more
than the value of 5000 bags. The farmer
may have a little fat put away, and we
can live on that for a while. But let us
be sure of this: no country has fat which
it does not use; and Australia’s loss of
fat is going to mean sore trouble in the
future. Many a manufacturer and many
a trader have already been compelled to
close down, and . sack all hands, because
their little bit of fat has been taken in taxes
for the purpose of keeping men out of
work.
The Bulletin said 12 months ago that
the unemployed who grew as much as a
cabbage, and to that extent reduced the
drain upon the community, was a public
benefactor. He is a benefactor still. Our
only hope of saving Australia is by increas-
ing the number of benefactors and cabbages
—cabbages, for the purposes of this argument,
including manufactures, which otherwise we
should have to either do without or pay
some foreigner for.
An Unvarnished Truth Party.
“Titus Salt” suggests a new party :
Despite all bunkum to the contrary, it is a good
thing to have political parties and men who believe
in them —not simply liars and thieves who profess
to believe, in the hope of profit. I don’t want any
genuine non-party government if such a thing were
possible—government by washed-out characters of
no distinctive coloring. I know of no intelligent
self-governing people who don’t rule themselves on
party lines —this despite stories of ancient Rome or
some such place where, despite the constant shindy
between patricians and plebeians, there was a certain
unity because classes had to hold together to keep
down the slaves and the conquered who didn’t
count. The last non-party system I know of burst
up about 1864. The Southern Confederacy was
ferociously united by the necessity for keeping the
nigger, who had no vote, from getting a vote.
Australia has room for a new party, quite unlike
anything existing at present, which might be called
the Plain Truth Organisation. It should be a differ -
entiation from the violent and almost universal
system of lying about the natural riches of Australia
—-lying that is almost compulsory, for anybody of
sufficient importance to make himself heard must
expect to be regarded as a malicious slanderer if
he mentions facts. I don’t object to the great
national bunkum on moral grounds, for I am no
more moral than the average; but the stupid habit
doesn’t pay. There is no sense in taking oneself in
with a confidence trick, or in a man calling at his
own door with a bogus prospectus and inquiring if
himself is in. That is what Australia, as a . nation,
is doing.
I don’t want the Unvarnished Truth Party to
disparage this continent, but just to take a stand
on the fact that it can’t endure any more debt,
that it is a very moderate-wage country, and that
its resources should be developed with its own
income, and that they might be better than they look
if they weren’t staggering under absurd interest bills.
The members of the party will probably be denounced
for a while by every existing party, including
Scullin’s and Hughes’s and the All for Australia
crowd and by Earle Page and the Communists, and
accused of all possible, sins because it doesn t lie
patriotically about our specialty, the dreary old
“resources,” but these matters are all in the day’s
work.
♦-
The Growth of Dishonesty.
It is not at all a bad thing that very few
of us are now ashamed to confess ourselves
poor. Poverty never was anything to be
ashamed of; but during the past few years
we have lived in a world where little else
except financial success seemed to matter,
and it is good to see the period of rank
materialism pass. But it is not at all a
good thing to see this general acceptance of
poverty being used as a cover for dis-
honesty. All business men expect to make
some bad debts: what is being very widely
complained of to-day is that credit is being
deliberately got beyond the debtor’s reason-,
able expectation of paying. In plain Eng-
lish, too many people are robbing traders
of their goods and contractors of their time,
comforting themselves with the reflection
that in these days no action will be taken
to expose them, and if they are exposed
that nobody will be shocked. One effect,
of course, will be to make it more difficult
for honest people to get credit, even though
credit may to them mean work.
It is not so easy to say what should be
done about it. Perhaps nothing much can
be done apart from rousing people to a
stronger sense of honor. But how much
progress can we hope to make along those
lines when we are surrounded by men who
preach repudiation and practise default and
are not dismissed from their high places
for it?


SERVICE
The establishment of a Bank does not in itself establish a Banking
Service. It provides only the machinery which is to be operated by
man for the service of man. The human factor is the vital spark
that gives life to a mere aggregation of buildings, books and currency,
and makes of them a friendly, helpful service for the convenience of
the people.
The Commonwealth Savings Bank extends its facilities throughout
the length and breadth of Australia, through Branches and Post-office
Agencies, and trained officers translate those facilities into understand-
ing human service to the thrifty.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Lang has, or professes to have, the stupid
idea . that the Leg. Assembly is the whole
Parliament; and it isn’t. Long ago it was
realised that some day some rogue might
get control of the Assembly, and, hired per-
haps by some foreign Power, sell the people;
therefore safeguards were provided. Lang’s
roar against the Governor is the cry of the
bank director against the auditor; and when
a bank director roars about an auditor, and
demands that the auditor shall do exactly
as he is told, it is time for the depositors to
look out.
Heinz, the sauce people, having inspected
Mr. Lang at close quarters, have dropped
the idea of building a factory in N. S. Wales;
a.nd, as an import trade is out of the ques-
tion, they will simply fade away. George
Watson, the co.’s director, who arrived 12
months ago to choose the site, has picked
a cabin on a homeward-bound ship instead.
The advts. of Russian motor-oil begin to
show up in Australia. Foreign trade is part
of the Five-year Plan. The idea is to sell
abroad for as little as half cost price, using
the gold as the basis of a 3 to 1 note issue.
Thus oil which cost 10 roubles can be sold
for the gold equivalent of 5 roubles, and
that looks like a loss of 5 roubles; but by
the simple process of locking up the 5 roubles
in a safe and issuing three pieces of paper
with “5 roubles” printed on each, the Soviet
Republic makes a profit of 5 roubles. It
•sounds very mad; still, quite as mad things
have been proposed in Australia.
There is no love lost between Vic. Pre-
mier Ilogan and Maurice Blackburn. Their
tiffs have usually been kept for the Caucus, but
one developed in the House when ITogan sug-
gested that, judging by the election of dele-
gates to the special Labor conference. Black-
burn was out of step with his constituents.
The member for Clifton Hill retorted that
his chief was reasoning from false premises.
The Clifton Hill branch had been built up
from elements that were not truly Labor to
oust Blackburn, Blackburn being opposed to
“certain city interests” —beer and pony-
racing. Because 250 members of the branch
differed from him as to the Premiers’ plan
it was ridiculous to infer that the other
25,750 electors agreed with the 250. The
majority of the House, while voting with
Hogan, relished the little scrap.
Of the present N.S.W. Leg. (Council 54
members were nominated by recent Labor
Governments, and several more are Labor-
ites nominated by non-Labor Governments.
“The axe has fallen on those who defied the Lang
.Government. The central executive of the A.L.P.
on Friday night declared 26 members of the Leg.
Council expelled from the party. The general
secretary’, Mr. J. J. Graves, pointed out that of 67
members appointed by Labor Governments, only 17
now remained loyal.”
Savings Bank Depositor: “Any idea when
a man can get his dough from the bank,
comrade t”
Lord High Executioner: “Don’t interrupt
a bloke when he’s busy. There are
twenty-three more heads to fall.”
Of the whole lot —nearly two-thirds of the
Chamber —only 17 are new-pledged sup-
porters of the Lang Government. A little
longer and there will be only one man in
step in the whole regiment.
By 143 to 87 the special Vic. conference
declared against the Premiers’ plan “so far
as it affects wages, pensions and social ser-
vices,” and ordered Vic. Federal and State
members to vote against it. Most of them
have already voted for it, and the Federal
Parliament is preparing to close down; but
presumably the conference must have its
little joke.
The 20 p.c. cut dating from July 1 brings
the pay of lower-deck R.A.N. ratings below
Royal Navy level. And R.N. ratings get
a rum ration and a pound of tobacco a
month, together with clothing at 40 per cent
less than Australian prices. The leave
allowance is 3s. 6d. a day in the R.N., as
against Is. sd. in the R.A.N. Lastly, naval
men are ranked as civil servants for the
purposes of the reductions. When salaries
and allowances were being raised in the boom
years only civilians were admitted to the
trough.
Lang can be as
bold as brass in Par-
liament, in Caucus
and in the Domain,
but isolate him from
his mob, big or little,
and he is revealed as
a poor old thing. The
Premiers dismissed in
stinging sentences his
appeals for alms
from the Loan Coun-
cil, to which he was
so boisterously un-
civil a few months
ago; and he had no
reply. The Common-
wealth Bank told
him, with cold con-
tempt, that there
must be no more
shilly-shallying in the
Savings Bank
matter; and he was
as dumb as a drum
with a hole in it. In
each case he had to
deal with resolute
men without a mob
to urge him on, and,
as is the way of mob
leaders all the world
over in like circum-
stances, his heart
dropped to his boots.
Another “Amending
Conc i 1 i ation and
Arbitration Bill”-
the 15th according to
Latham, who keeps
an account of these
things—has come and
gone. It. was designed to restore the
17 conciliation committees which the
Scullidores set up when they thought the
Millennium was at hand, and which dis-
appeared after a hostile High Court judg-
ment ; designed also to take a Vic. railway
case out of the Arbitration Court and let
one of the 17 conciliation committees have
a go at it. The measure was introduced by
Attorney-General Frank Brennan, and about
the most effective speech against it was made
by brother Tom Brennan, now a U.A.P.
Senator. Twenty-one other Senators agreed
with Tom and hoofed it out.
Australians visiting Britain used to pity
the inhabitants because they had to pay
iucome tax at the rate of 4s. 6d. in the £.
It is the _ turn of visiting Britons to sym-
pathise with Australians. According to the
“Daily Mail” Year-Book, the married Briton
with £5OO of “unearned” income pays £3l
if lie is childless and £ll if he has three
children; on £6OO tax is £53 if there are
no children, £2l if there are three. The
new Commonwealth tax on “unearned” in-
come (the only sort which old people past
work can derive) is £66 13s. 4d. on £5OO and
£B3 10s. on £6OO. State and unemployment
taxes (roughly, 2s. in the £ in Lang’s coun-
try, and he wants to make them ss. in the
£) are additional.
Premier Jimmy Mitchell, of Westralia,
who has been roused to extra fury by the
remarks of Professor Copland about the
shirking of taxation, declares for the hun-
dredth time that what his State requires
is Freetrade, the same as they have in Eng-
land. It is an ancient and unscrupulous dodge
for distracting attention, for Mitchell can
blame the tariff on the eastern States, while
the financial rottenness is his own respon-
sibility. But it would have been more
decent if he had said that his huge State
was in need of an Established Church and
a hereditary peerage, the same as they have
in England, and possibly a pyramid or two.
This land has never tried a pyramid.
The Moore Government is crowding a lot
of contentious matter into the last session
of the present Queensland Parliament; 22
bills were named in the Governor’s Speech.
And then no mention was made of restora-
tion of the Upper House. There are to be
amendments of the Police Offences Act (Con-
sorting) and the Companies Act, and several
new Land Bills are proposed. One dealing
with the settlement of reclaimed prickly-pear
country will affect a very large area close
to the railway.
The variations in the basic wage are
becoming ridiculous. The figures have just
been fixed anew on the cost of living, and
run from £3 7s. in Brisbane and £3 13s. in
Melbourne and Perth up to £4 Is. in Sydney.
One result is that work which has been
done in Sydney hitherto is drifting steadily
to Brisbane and Melbourne. For instance,
the big wholesale drug-houses of Australia
lately “merged” ; and then it was found that
preparations which had been made in Sydney
for donkey’s years could be put up for 10
per cent, less in Brisbane. And Brisbane
quotations for a big printing job were nearly
20 per cent, lower than those of Sydney,
where the work had been done hitherto. Lang
has got this justification, anyway, for going
round to the other States with his beggar’s
bowl: he has driven hundreds of thousands’
worth of work into the other capitals.
“Faced with the prospect of being unable to pay wages and salaries next
week, Premier Lang has been ordered by the party executive to ‘re attend the
Loan Council and carry on the fight for the adoption of his financial proposals
from within that body.’”
RETURNED PRODIGAL: “Friends, don’t be hard on a democrat who
hasn’t a feather to fly with if he says this—Garden and
Graves tell me I’ve got to say it. I’m here to fight.”
It cost a lot to remove mallee from the
north-west corner of Victoria. A lot more
was spent on railways which are hopelessly
unpayable. The State’s Year-Book, just
out, reports the last three wheat crops from
Mallee counties as ”1 bushels, 7f- bushels
and 2 bushels respectively. Mallee farmers
have been helped with loans and grants to
an immense extent till the Treasury doesn’t
know where it stands, and they have been
helped at other people’s expense by the mora-
torium device. Now the land is blowing
about in a disagreeable way for want of
the mallee roots to hold it together.
After deciding last week that the six
Supreme Court Judges should surrender
about £650 each from their salaries, £2500 p.a.,
Vic. Assembly declared that £l7OO proposed*
to be taken from its own country members
should go back to them. The original idea
was that private members should get £397
instead of their former £5OO, but the amend-
ment fixed £447 for 34 country members and
£397 for 23 city representatives—the six
salaried Ministers and the two' elective offi-
cers do not draw as members. Menzies, a
city man, submitted the differential rate.
Premier Hogan persuaded him to withdraw,
but Hjorth, a country Labor member, had
the thing put to the vote. It was beyond
one o’clock in the morning when the verdict
was given, and later in the week, after a
critical public had spoken, there was talk
of recommittal.
Jimmy Jewell, the Government Whip,
voted against the Hogans on the second
reading of the Financial Emergency Bill in
Vic. Assembly, but he had taken the pre-
caution of mustering a four-to-one majority
for the measure. A Jewell of consistency,
it is confidently expected that he will retain
both his Whipship and his seat. As Min-
isters were included in the retrenchment
scale an absolute majority of the House (331
was needed. The actual majority was 15
more.
London has been swamped with copies of
a pamphlet issued at the N-S.W. taxpayers’
expense by Agent-General Willis, who is also
advance-agent for Premier Lang. It is
entitled “The Lang Plan : The Case for Aus-
tralia,” and Australia has cause for feeling
wild at a mere State understrapper posing
on its behalf and doing it so badly. To
judge from the cabled extracts the composer
must he the person who put together the
16-column advertisement containing Lang’s
assurance of the stability of the State Sav-
ings Bank just before the stoppage, and the
same who wrote Lang’s congratulatory mes-
sage to the “S. M. Herald” on its 100th
birthday—the message which stated that
‘ religion, science, art are the vehicles to
raise us to the mountain peaks that tower
above the slough of despond, the morass of
falsehood and the quagmire of obsolete for-
mulae.” “The Lang Plan” is an appeal
launched like an avalanche from the bound-
less soap-box of rhetoric, its striking feature
being the assurance that Lang’s attitude in
failing to meet his liabilities “is backed by
the great economists of the world, including
the jettisoning of the gold standard.” “The
jettisoning of the gold standard,” as the
name of a great. economist, seems ungram-
matical.
The day after the news about “The Lang
Plan” appeared Lang went to Canberra to
see Scullin and ask him for the love of Mike
to lend a few millions more or the great
bankburst might be aggravated by a failure
to pay -wages. It was something like the
cold-weather pilgrimage of a more famous
penitent to Canossa, weather included.
As from August 1 the Vie. State Savings
Bank is bringing down its rate of interest on
ordinary deposits from 4 p.c. to 34 p.c. and
on stock from 41 p.c. to 4 p.c. When the
Premiers were fixing up their arrangement
it was agreed tentatively at a conference of
S.B. representatives to make a reduction of
1 p.c.
The MacMillan committee recommended
that the Bank of England should be autho-
rised to issue notes up to £400,000,000, with
provision for a small occasional temporary
increase when required. The notes issued
last week amounted to £423,991,026, though
only £358,913,277 worth was iji the hands
of the public. The committee proposed aLso
a gold reserve of £75,000,000, which is much
less than the amount held at present. This
seems to be the only pink streak in the
report. Bolsheviks regard it as half-hearted.
“11. R.” finds another tax anomaly
I pay N.S.W. unemployment relief tax and at the
same time am supporting a son who has been out
of work for nearly two years. Upon looking for the
place where I could put in a deduction for his keep,
I found I would have to be a bachelor, widow,
widower, divorced person or spinster to be qualified
to claim a deduction; and I am a plain married man
living happily with my wife. An income-tax official
agreed with me that the distinction was absurd
and that I was getting the thick end of the stick;
but that is mild criticism of one feature of our un-
necessarily complicated and badly drafted income-tax
regulations.
The S. Aus. Liberals blundered badly in
not running a man for tlie Adelaide Assem-
bly by-election. They left the field to a
Gang-plan candidate, an “endorsed” Laborite
whom the Hill Government rejected, a Com-
munist, a Socialist and a nondescript. Saul

and humiliated by the whole proceedings,
will conclude that nothing really matters
in this maddest of all by-elections, and will
stay at home” ; and two-thirds of them did,

the Gang-planner being elected with exactly
300 fewer votes than a Liberal got in 1927.
Staying at home never helped a good cause
or hindered a bad one; the missing two-
thirds could have best expressed their disgust
and humiliation by spoiling their ballot-
papers.
“Bildad”: The N.S.W. Country party has
decided to run candidates against the
Nationalists at next election. I should like
to know what is the exact point of differ-
ence. It can hardly be the tariff, for the
tariff isn’t in State politics. It can hardly
be that Buttenshaw wants to borrow more
or less than Bavin, for neither can get any-
thing: The desire to establish new States
seems too languid an emotion to explain the
separation; when the Country party held
the balance of power in the 1927 Parliament
it could have stated that it must have its
price or it would only attend often enough
to qualify for its salary, which is once in a
session, and thus demoralise the apple-cart.
A party that was well organised and in dead
earnest might have brought matters to a
head in that -way. Perhaps the Country
party isn’t sufficiently in a temper for a
real fight.


SOCIETY
"and it's

WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Penfield”: When I see members of Par-
liament in my State (S.A.) getting hot
under the collars over the training of their
teachers (they are dreadfully afraid of cut-
ting down expenses anywhere), I remember
how teachers were appointed and trained
in South Aus. not so long ago. When I went
to a “public” school 50 years back the head-
master was a peppery gentleman w T ho had
kept one of the village’s butchers’ shops. On
the question of setting up a school being
mooted, and on our fathers being asked who
should keep it, their thoughts instantly
bounded to the bills they got; and the
butcher’s, it was universally admitted, were
far and away the most scholarly of all. So
far as they could tell he never spelt “mutton”
with one t or “suet” with an i, and his
letters were beautifully rounded —you could
tell what the bill was about at a glance.
So the school was set up and the butcher
got the job; and when assistants were
wanted, what more natural and proper than
that his wife and his daughters, brought up
and trained by himself, should be inducted?
I don’t know how he was paid: I only know
I took 9d. to him every Monday morning,

Fitzwilliam ; The row that is going on
about the lighting of the Sydney G.P.O.

has so endeared Sydney to the rest of the

Australia apparently jibs at paying such an
amount for the same purpose. It is not the
function of a post-office to provide the town
clock, nor is there any obvious reason why a
citizen of Geraldton (W.A.) should be taxed
to pay for lighting a clock that he has never
seen nor is likely to see.

“Mako”: One of the things that strike
a visitor to Parliament House, Canberra,
is the extreme insignificance of the stairs
up which the public is led to gaze into the
Senate. The narrow and twisted contrap-
tion wouldn’t be tolerated in any modern
dwelling, and how some of our
elderly and adipose legislators
negotiate it safely is a mystery.

tor looked round and requested

what the scene on that stairs

stress.
‘“Runa”: Queer how appli-
cants for motor licenses so often
have to look back on the tests
as their unlucky moments. One
Maoriland youth I know actu-
ally knocked down and killed an
elderly man on his trial run ; he
never handled a wheel again.
Recently a woman who had light-
heartedly taken her new car out
to qualify for her license returned
home in tears and on foot. To
her perturbed family she related
that she had damaged the car,
herself, a tree and the policeman
who was driving with her, the
last so badly that he had been
removed to hospital. In a recent
Maoriland case a youth who was
being put through his tests
by the local county council’s inspector
crashed into and damaged the council gates.
Covered with confusion he backed hurriedly
on to the road, and in doing so ran over and
killed the inspector’s dog.
“Tess”: Policewomen having proved a
success in London, the sex is now to be
invited to supply 25 detectives to the metro-
politan force, and if the anplications don’t
run into tens of thousands it will be a
wonder. The female ’tec, it is reckoned,
will be particularly useful in curbing the
illegitimate activities of the night clubs
which have been giving so much trouble
these last few years. Australia is less
bountifully supplied with such establish-
ments. but the she-sleuth, when she comes, will
doubtless be valuable as a permanent side-
partner for constables in dinner-coats
when restaurants are to be raided. One
qualification for detective work in which
woman is certainly no whit inferior to man
lies in her tenacious memory for faces.
When these are feminine faces she can give
the male of the species points. Probably,
indeed, she has a better equipment for
espionage ;' the best-advertised spies in the
Great War were women.
“Rue Royale”: The Ivylsant case, in which
the jirosecution claims that “nearly a mil-
lion sterling was taken from the" R.M.S.
Packet’s fat without the shareholders being
given a hint that anything was wrong,” sug-
gests that English financial journalism is get-
ting like that of France. In Paris the papers
don’t employ a financial expert to tell the
public what companies are doing; the com-
panies pay for the right to give the informa-
tion themselves. One of the biggest Paris
banks is the chief shareholder in one of the
biggest Paris newspapers and the newspaper
naturally booms the bank’s enterprises. The
system got a good deal of publicity during
the Hanau trial, when it appeared that
Madame Hanau had paid heavily for eulo-
gistic paragraphs about her swindles to papers
in which public men were interested. The
Paris papers have to do it to live. There are
too many of them, and advertising revenue
is small. The position of most of the London
papers is different, and it is not likely that
any of them are being financed by financiers
--yet. But there is a growing suspicion
that some of tbeir city experts may be. It
is hard to explain the appalling and wholly
unexpected crashes of the last couple of
years on any other grounds.

chist should be regarded as any worse than

in the Balkans. In the ’seventies Gladstone
made England ring with a recital of the
atrocities the poor wretch was enduring at

“Lizard Passage” : A historied ship went
to Davy Jones when the old steamer Gov-
ernor Blackall, long degenerated into a coal-
hulk. was sunk outside Sydney Heads
recently. She was built in
Sydney as a Government
yacht for the Queenslanders
in 1872, and because the then
Premier, Charles Lilley, had
omitted to ask Parliamentary
sanction for her construction
there was the divil to pay in
northern politics. She was
lent as a yacht to Sir Peter
Scratchley, first of the Colo-
nial Office Governors to take
charge of what is now Papua.
After a short period at Port
Moresby Sir Peter died and
his body had to be taken to
Cooktown (N.Q.) for embalm-
ing and recoffining, a pretty
gruesome business, according
to some of those who made
the journey. A Bulletin
employee is the proud posses-
sor of the first summons over

as it then was. He had gone
ashore at “Port” by night
without leave, and was duly
carpeted. The document is
written on a sheet of foolscap

usual form, and is a prized

was a member of the old Governor’s crew.

“Clodius” : In an article on “Stooping to
Conquer” the “S. M. Herald” pours scorn on
what it regards as an ignoble way of rising
to prominence in public affairs: —
It is the way of the Ponsonby and Trevelyan
type in England (and its counterpart in Australia),
which chooses to cut a figure in “Labor” ranks
simply because it is determined to be at the head
of something, no matter what.
Ponsonby, who now helps to represent Labor
in the Lords, is an Etonian who was once a
page-of-honor to Queen Victoria ; Trevelyan
is the grand-nephew of Lord Macaulay. But
perhaps an even better and a double-barrelled
example of that “stooping” which the
“5.M.11.” deplores is furnished by the Mosley
pair, a wealthy baronet and the daughter of
a marquis, who not only joined the Labor
party but left it because it was not advanced
enough for them. Nevertheless, there is no
reason why such people should be accused of
insincerity. Fifty years ago, before there was
a Labor party, the most determined Radicals
in the House of Commons were Charles Dilke
and Henry Labouchere. one a baronet, the
other a wealthy ex-diplomat. Nobody ever
questioned that they were in earnest in
their attacks on institutions which they might
have been expected to support.
“Lex": The Archbishop of Canterbury's
rebuke to Dr. Barnes, of Birmingham (“You
have deliberately placed yourself in con-
tempt of the law. As patron of the living I
could have applied for a writ of attachment,
which might have involved your imprison-
ment”), is the clearest threat of inhibition
that has been made publicly to a bishop in
recent times. Anglican clerics can be inhi-
bited under the Benefices Act (1898) for,
amongst other things, breaking their ordina-
tion vows by “outrageous sermons,” or by
“failing to set forward quietness, peace and
love.” According to the Archbishop, Dr.
Barnes’s opinion with regard to Reservation
is “inconsistent with Article 2S or the words
of the Catechism,” and many churchmen
have objected to the brilliant sermons in
which he has scouted Genesis, and much else
in the Old Testament. I sat in St. Paul’s,
London, four years ago and saw half the
congregation troop out when he ascended
the pulpit—an organised gesture of protest.
But he is going to be a hard man to disci-
pline. He was appointed during the first
MacDonald Administration and has many
staunch friends in Labor circles, while his
Conservative supporters include one of the
most effective controversialists of modern

“2nd Divvy”: Professor Parsons, of the
U.S.A. Advisory Board on Gas Warfare, .said-
in London last week :
While 30 per cent, ot' the casualties at the close
of the war resulted from gas, only two per cent,
died.
The prejudice against gas as a weapon, which
persists to this day, was created originally by
anti-Boche propagandists, and intensified by
war-poets of the grisly Siegfried Sassoon
school. Post-war scrimsliankers have done
their bit. I never met a congenital loafer,
during a couple of years spent recently in
England, who didn’t ascribe his alleged
incapacity to do anything but rest and drink
beer to the fact that he had been gassed for
the Empire. The statistical truth is that of
Britain’s 175,000 gas casualties only one in
forty died, and only one in a hundred was
permanently injured. The next war will be
a picnic indeed if it is waged with gas alone.
A quaint war-memory which I cherish is of a
couple of Diggers playing billiards with
masks on at Morlancourt in 1918 while the
village was being gassed. That showed their
opinion of the horror.

“Swax” on the tribulations of the rich: —
A N. S. Wales grazier was fined £2OOO the other
day for trying to dodge income tax. And that
wasn’t the worst of it, either; lie thought he was
escaping some of the heavy burden of probate tax,
and now that show has been spoiled. How to keep
intact the little bit you've scraped together for the
wife and children has made enough white hairs to
provide two complete changes of dress for every
polar bear in the world. The only sure way to
escape is to have nothing to pay on; and even
then some bird with a strong claw- and a threatening
beak will want to find out how long it is since
the deceased made a pauper of himself. The N.S.AY.
sheep-barber beforementioned adopted the much more
perilous plan of taking out a probate insurance
policy. Now, a probate policy is quite a good
thing; anyway, you know that, if the policy is
large enough, the missus and kids won’t have to
starve for a while to make up the tax; also they
won’t have to throw securities on a market which
for the moment loathes them. But it wasn’t that
sort of probate policy which caused our friend trouble.
That sort is part of the estate and must pay tax,
too; another sort is exempt from taxation—if some-
body else really pays the premiums. But as the
missus and the boys (or the girls) generally haven't
the money, the temptation is to provide it for them.
If, however, you do that openly, then the can-
tankerous person who collects stamp duty laughs at
you; and if you try to do it as the gentleman from
Carrathool did, then there are other pitfalls waiting
for you, with sharp spear-points at the bottom. The
law isn’t quite the same in every State; but near
enough to always make things uncomfortable.

From him is no unlikelier than from me.
Or ask Mustapha Ivemal, that aspiring
Pasha whose court, is at Angora set, _
Whether and when he contemplates retiring,
And see what sort of answer you will get.
Resign! The bare idea I scorn and scout.
Not till they drag me out!
What? Quit the tart-sliop of my own volition
Before the shelves are rifled of their store?
Such an intolerable proposition
I’ll swear I never listened to before.
What though my name is Mud, my waning
star low;
What though you found one morning when
you woke
I’d broke a bank (and not at Monte Carlo,
Unfortunately it was yours I broke) ;
Should I resign because of that mishap?
I’m not that sort of chap.
Resign, because, now chance is none to
borrow
Or bounce or brag, to bilk and beg I’ve
got?
Resign, because I’ll have to eat to-morrow
My words of yesterday, as like as not?
Resign, because along the road to ruin
AVe go at breakneck speed, and tongues
malign
Blame it on me? No, no, there’s nothing-
doin’.
I take my Bible oath I won't resign.
Here where I am I’ll stay, beyond a doubt,
Until they throw me out!

“H. Hardupp”; A man who destroyed
himself in Sydney the other day cut things
very fine. He was fished out of the water
at a lonely spot; hard by w r as the decrepit
car w’hieli had borne him there. Investiga-
tion of his affairs disclosed that his land-
lady, her patience exhausted, had turned
him out of his room; that a motor firm had
notified him of its intention to “repossess”
the car that day if an instalment was not
forthcoming; that a restaurant proprietor
in whose debt he was had given him a
meal on credit, with a warning that it was
the last; and that a publican to whom
he owed a score had loosened up to the
extent of a small bottle of whisky on the
debtor’s assurance that he intended to
“square everything up this afternoon.” Not
eveh a ha’penny was found in his pocket,
the whisky bottle was empty, and when
an effort was made to move the car it
was found that the last drop of petrol had
been burnt. Hardly anybody has suc-
ceeded in coming to the end of so many things
(including his own life) simultaneously.

“Drifter” (from aboard the Eastern Glen,
just entering Boston, U.S.A.) : Tales there
are aplenty of ships under power ramming
derelicts—well, here’s one where the help-
less one turned the tables. Slugging lazily
through the doldrums on a freighter bound
from Capetown to Boston, we were called by
SOS to the rescue of a disabled tanker and
proceeded to take her in tow. She proved a
clumsy and fractious female. Owing to
trouble with her steering gear she zigzagged
badly and one of the hawsers parted. Our
boat pulled up, but the derelict, being
heavier, kept going and presently was rang-
ing slowly abreast of us and about 200
yards off. Then the remaining hawSer got
busy and gently swung her nose towards
VALUES.
“She married a man with twenty thousand—how would that suit you, Jessie?”
“Ah don’ know. ’Twould depend on what the mon was woorth.”
us. Our captain saw the danger and ordered
“Full speed ahead”; and we leaned
over the rail and held our breaths as our
boat slowly drew away and the derelict
drifted ever so gently towards us. The sea
was smooth, the sun shining, and every-
thing looked so peaceful that the thought of
danger seemed grotesque. Just two big
ships moving so very slowly. But the
derelict made no mistake —tapped us ever
so gently near the stern. Although
you’d swear that at the pace she’d scarcely
bulge a plate, when she gracefully backed
away she left a hole in our hull that four
men could crawd through—luckily above the
waterline. At time of writing she’s dragging
sulkily behind us at a whole six knots, and
this passenger is sleeping badly o’ nights,
being haunted by the fear that when he's
not looking she’ll come along and give us
another of her gentle little love-taps.
“Jehudah”: One of the quaintest cases—
apart from its interesting legal aspect—
which have come before the English Courts
of late was an action brought by one Miss
Orpen against certain London picture-shows
for breaking the Lord’s Day Observance
Act of 1781. The lady appeared as a
common informer, and. though the pre-
siding Judge felt bound by the statute to
award her £5OOO, he got a lot off his chest
in doing so. He mentioned that the young
woman’s employer was a solicitor named
Cohen, trading as Jacques, Asquith and
Jacques, and that the damsel had thought-
fully changed her name by deed poll from
Oppenheim to Orpen before appearing as the
champion of the sanctity of the English
Sabbath. No claim could have been pre-
sented in less attractive circumstances, his
Ludship added—-a remark that would doubt-
less have weighed with the Appeal Court if
Miss Orpen, late Oppenheim, had not coyly
announced that she would waive her right
to the £5OOO.
“Inner Temple” : Despite the efforts of the
Lord’s Day Observance Society the English
Sunday is now very like the Continental one.
Recent statistics showed that over two mil-
lion Britons follow their ordinary employment
on Sunday. A quarter of a million shops
are open, and 86,728 licensed premises. In
London alone 500,000 people go to cinemas
every Sunday. The fashionable restaurants
and night clubs are crowded with dancers,
every kind of game is played, and nothing
but the fact that the theatres can’t get pay-
ing week-day audiences debars them from
opening on Sunday as well. The Sunday
League is chiefly responsible. It has been
working for something approximating to a
Continental Sunday since the days when it
was as hard for a poor man to travel on
Sunday in England as it now 7 is in Melbourne.
“X.N.0.” : The reason why in the R.N. “no
one below the rank of warrant officer is ex-
pected to have a thirst” may be found in one
word —space. There isn’t enough of that to
permit of liquid supplies being carried, even
for a month’s cruise. The reason officers are
all owed wine and spirits is, first, because
they are officers and, second, because the
space required in their case is infinitesimal.
Even warrant officers do not carry their
own stock, but are compelled to buy from
the wardroom, and only a drink at a time.
Incidentally, smuggling liquor is just as
serious an offence on the part of an officer
as on that of a man.
“Farleigh” : You may see some quaint ads.
in the “Situations Wanted” columns these
days, but surely nothing quainter than the
announcement in a Sydney suburban daily
the other morning that “mother of an heir”
was available for domestic work. What the
youngster was heir to wasn’t mentioned —
after all, everyone is heir to something, if
only all the ages or the stainless name that
the man in bellow 7 drama used to talk about
—but no other qualification for household
duties was itemised. Is it just an appeal
to good nature, or are there women who
would be favorably affected by the considera-
tion that their wmshing was being struggled
with by the mother of, say, a possible
baronet or landed proprietor of the future?

“Free Companion”; Commenting on the
giant catapult used by the Royal Air Force
to accelerate the rising of huge bombing
’planes, an English journal asserts that
these were used in the Punic wars, and that
the method of twisting the ox sinews or hair
that gave the means of propulsion is a lost
art. There is a confusion here between the
catapult and the mangonel, both highly popu-
lar up to the Middle Ages. The mangonel
consisted of an upright beam fixed in a
roller, round which the twisted hair or
sinew 7 ropes w r ere wound. Tension was
gained bv a windlass which nulled the beam
to a horizontal position. When released the
springs pulled it rapidly upright, and a
netful of stones was thrown by the force
of impact into the beleaguered town. Instead
of stones, the heads of captured prisoners
were occasionally used to give the besieged
an idea of what was waiting for them.
DIDN’T TAKE HIs WORD FOR IT.
NATIONALIST PPLITICIAN'S WIFE: “My husband says consistency is a
jewel.”
LABOR DITTO: “Yes, but you got him to put it into an engagement
ring, didn’t you?”
“Fitzo”: The owner of a cottage in one
of Sydney’s industrial suburbs was notified
by his tenant that the cistern needed repair,
and, after satisfying himself that it did, sent
along a plumber wdio had been a teacher.
The operator was received at the door by
an obviously blithered lady who eyed him
suspiciously. Nothing daunted, he raised
his hat, turned on his most engaging smile,
and mentioned that he had called to repair
the cistern. He said it three times -without
receiving any response beyond “Eh?” and
“Wot’s that?” At last the ex-dominie’s
politeness gave way. “Look here,” he
roared, “where the hell is that blarsted
thing that won’t work?” A smile of under-
standing rewarded the new method of
address. “Oh, ’im?” hiccuped the housewife.
“ ’E’s gorn to the ponies.”

“Jackaburra”: Are the ladies beginning to
“roll their own” as a result of the depres-
sion ? This item figured in a recent order
to my firm: “lib. fine-cut to-
bacco, nicely perfumed, suitable
for lady.” Apparently the
manufacturers haven’t yet risen
to the occasion, for we were
unable to supply.

“Darlinghearsed” : I encoun-
tered him in King’s Cross, Syd-
ney, a rather ancient sample of
the Burlington Bertie type, in
a frayed frockcoat and spats
considerably the worse for wear.
Me still retained what used to
bo called in other days “a mili-
tary carriage,” but the most
impressive item in the get-up
was liis walking-cane and the
play he made with it. One
moment it was digging on the
pavement, the next its lower
point came into his off hand,
then the cane was whirling
round again in the air. It
puzzled me, until I got a close-
up. Then I perceived that at
the end of the stick was a pin;
without varying the dignified
erectness of his bearing the
operator impaled every stray
cigarette-butt he saw lying on the ground.
In an instant it was in his spare hand, while
the twirling stick proclaimed another catch.
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: The Chilean training-
ship General Baquedano was brought into a
remote connection with the Great War.
After the battle of the Falklands, when the
Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Nurnberg and Leip-
zig were sunk, the Dresden escaped, and,
making her way through the Straits of
Magellan, arrived at Juan Fernandez, whore
she eluded the British cruisers for some time.
As the choice of such a shelter might have
led to international complications, the General
Baquedano was sent to the island to see
that Chilean interests were not prejudiced.
The selection of the corvette for this
service, instead of one of the powerful
Chilean cruisers, seems to have been mis-
understood by the German; anyhow Fritz in-
formed the commander that lie wasn’t wanted
there. Seething with indignation, he returned
to Valparaiso (I was there at the time) and
reported the incident. The Cabinet met
hurriedly; a few days later the story leaked
out, and Chile was in a turmoil. Then cam"
the tidings that the Dresden had been sunk
by the Glasgow and Kent, and indignation
was changed to rejoicing.
“Montes’ : The “mouse in the meat-pie”
swindle is not unknown in Australia; a
couple of operators obtained £lOO from a
Perth catering firm by means of the grim
exhibit not many
years ago, though
an attempt to
repeat the fraud
on the other side
of the continent
washed. A vari-
ant cropped up
the other day in
Cologne, where an
agitated woman
produced a baked-
liver sausage
containing a
mouse cooked to
a turn on one
side, and threat-
en e d publicity.
Unfortunately for
the conspirators,
the defence was
able to prove
that the mouse
couldn’t have got
into the sausage
before the minc-
ing, being still
integral, and
couldn’t have got
in afterwards, be-
ing only partially
halted. whereas
the rest of the
comestible was
cooked from A to
V, so to speak.
So the concoc-
ters of the plot
went to gaol for
collusive black-
mail. Obviously
the pie fraud was
tne safer, i .
member a brand
of jam suffering
a temporary loss
of popularity in
a West r a 1 ian
town because a
woman found a
mouse in it. She
didn’t threaten
any action, either:
merely brought it
to the local news-
paper office and
slapped the
freshly-opened tin
with its contents
down on an
amazed editor’s
table with a
“W hat d’you
think of that?”
“Shep”: Touching the use of oil as a
footwarmer (B. 15/7/’3l), few medical
authorities can have been more soundly
cursed than the investigator who recom-
mended whale oil to ward off trench feet.
The slushy muck of Flers w r as as cold as
charity at any time; still, if a man could
move around at all he could feel some circu-
lation in his sodden extremities, whereas
whale oil would send them numb with the
cold for hours together. None the less it
was highly regarded by headquarters, and to
enforce its use our doc. worked the combina-
tion of rum and oil together, so that a man
missing the oil would thereby forfeit his
issue of S.R.D. “What’s the good uv us
cornin’ ’ere to get a warmer for our in-
nards,” I heard one old-timer complain, “if
yer goin’ ter freeze our outards?”

“Kirkwall” : Gandhi’s claim for one and a
quarter billions sterling on account of
damages incurred by India since the East
India Company butted in reminds me that
Britain has another big outstanding
account, but this time a credit one. It was
opened in 1468, when Denmark pawned the
Orkneys and Shetlands for 150,600 crowns
to Scotland. When Scotland was merged with
England and Wales by the Act of Union,
the combine took over all liabilities and
assets of its members. Denmark has never
done anything to lift the mortgage or pay
the interest, and, presumably, it all still
stands, subject to the statutes in such case
made and provided. The total sum now
repayable at compound interest must be so
considerable that probably the Sea> Kings
long ago decided that it was cheaper to risk
foreclosure than wake things up by suggest-
ing repayment.

“Silas”: A gent, named K. Webster
Stocking, who is secretary to someone or
something not stated in Jersey City, N.J..
has addressed to the newspapers of the
world a breathless and voluminous commu-
nique concerning the exploits of a Dr. Thom-
son, who not only is the “author of the
mother-document 1783 of the U. S. Con-
stitution 1787,” but “architect, inventor and
father of the entire TJ.S. Constitution in
its main points.” This Dr. Thomson, who
must be getting quite elderly, has explored
the Far East and the tropics. He has a
sister who has a “Seigneurial home” on the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, and what is more
has had a picture of it in a magazine, and
his second cousin married the chairman
of the U. S. Steel Corporation, “for whom
he [don’t ask me what “he” or which
“whom”] wrote his first book of romantic
poems w r hen they w r ere' playmates in Cleve-
land and N. Y. City.” These statements are,
however, merely asides, garnishings as it
were of the much-stressed information that
Dr. Thomson breeds Eskimos and crosses
them with Samoyedes, a recent product
being a grandson of the Eskimo who led
Peary to the Pole, in connection with which
Dr. Thomson has taken up with the Cana-
dian Government the calling of a eom 7en-
tion of all nations concerned to carry out
Peary’s dying wish, whatever that was. But
it is not for these matters, absorbingly
interesting though they be, that this remark-
able document will linger long in the memory
of every reader. It is when K. Webster
Stocking refers to “the largest benching of
Samoyedes ever brot together in America’
that he rivets attention. “Brot!” It is
massive, sublime, imperishable.

Neil Macgroarty, Queensland’s Attorney-
General, who is leading for the Crown in
the Mungana case, is well qualified for a

a notable Rugby player and is now one of
the Queensland Rugby Union executive.
Curiously enough, Neil Macrossan, his
learned friend on the other side, was a ■con-
temporary at Nudgee College, a famous
Brisbane foundation, and a rival athlete to
boot. The Attorney-General graduated to

MACGROARTY.
the Bar from the lower branch of the profes-
sion, being a member of the firm of O'Sulli-
van and Macgroarty before he was called in
1919. This is his first Parliament, for he
was returned for South Brisbane* when the
Moore Government won to power in 1929,
and he can be counted among the select few
who have jumped straight from private life
to a Cabinet portfolio.
Norman Lindsay, a greying Norman, but
with eyes as bright and flashing as ever, went
off to America last week with his very
capable wife and a large consignment of
water-colors, etchings and blaek-and-whites :
these are for an exhibition which his book-
publishers and friends of the “Cosmopoli-
tan” want him to hold in New York. He
has to get into closer touch with the “Cos-
mopolitan,” wdiich is planning to use much
of his work, and there is another “Redheap”
to put into the publisher’s hands. Accord-
ing to present arrangements the Lindsays
will be back early next year: they have left
their children at Springwood.
Christopher Augustus (“Gus”) Kelly,
Labor M.L.A. for Bathurst (N.S.W.), is a
worried man these days. Because he would
hate to lose his job, he never finishes what he
has begun to say about Lang, and after every
outburst is forced to explain away his early
rebellious thoughts. Part of the trouble is that
Bathurst, which he won so easily in 1927.
lost a number of solid Labor centres in the
last redistribution, and it was only ihe
decided swing towards Langism which helped
him to retain his gold pass last year. During
tlie week-ends Gus is thus inclined to be a
raging lion among his constituents, and
GUS. KELLY, N. S. Wales M.L.A.
from Tuesday to Friday a ruffled dove in
Macquarie-street. lake, other country Labor
members Kelly probably hopes for a new
leader to rise in Caucus and depose Lang
before that gentleman brings about an elec-
tion and the consequent loss of most of the
rural seats. Before entering Parliament
Augustus was a laboratory assistant at the
Commonwealth Portland cement works.
Genial and rotund, he is well liked in the
House.
Edwin Mitchelson, who is 85. opened the
Address-in-Reply debate in M.L.’s Leg.
Council. The knightly veteran first entered
Parliament 50 years ago, two years later
attaining Cabinet rank in the Atkinson Min-
istry. Before his appointment to the Uppah
House he had , been out of active politics for
a quarter of a century.
Acting-Gov. Irvine (Vic.) having been
freed from judicial duties for the next six
months, Leo Cussen, senior puisne Judge,
becomes Acting C.J. from the beginning of
next month. Judge Wasley, of the County
Court, who has been relieving justice of the
Supreme Court for the last four years, is to
continue for another six months. Probably
the arrangement will be extended half-yearly
until a new Governor is appointed.
A notable Cairns (Q.) pioneer was John
Miller, gone west at the age of 91. He was
one of the party that arrived to open
the port in 1876. The dense scrub
came down almost to the beach in those
days. John Miller and another man
cleared the land for the post-office (an
empty brandy-case slung from a pole) and for
the Customs House, where a half-masted flag
was to fly in honor of his memory 55 years
later.
Looking for someone to apply the boot
to, the Lang Laborites have picked on Dave
Watkins, M.H.R. for Newcastle, the cause
of offence being that he proposes to run as
a Federal Labor candidate at next election.
Watkins shares with Hughes the distinction
of having been an M.H.R. ever since the
Commonwealth came into existence; like
Hughes, too, he was in the State Parlia-
ment from 1894 to 1901. Before that he
was sec. to the Wallsend Miners’ Union, He
was born at Wallsend 66 years ago.
Captain 0. Ivemmett returned to Aus-
tralia the other day after 30 years’ absence.
He noticed two things in particular about
Sydney. It had none of the immemorial
smells of Eastern Asia, and it seemed to
have lost most of the Australian shipping
which once thronged the harbor. His last
voyage from an Australian port was in 1901.
when he took the transport Templemore
from Brisbane to Port Elizabeth wfith the
sth Queensland Bushmen and their horses
on board. “Among those present” on that
occasion w’a.s Robert Philp, then Premier of
Queensland, who went across to South
Africa to see a sick son, and “Tommy
Dodds, now Adjutant-General of what is
left of the Australian military forces, and
then captain and adjutant of the regiment.
Herbert Dettmarin, headmaster of Sydney
Grammar, which has just had its £l5OO a
year of Government endowment lopped away
after 70 years, is a native of Bathurst
(N.S.W.) ; his father was Major John Dett-
marin, inspector of schools, so he may be
said to have grown up to the trade. He
went from Sydney Uni. to Balliol, Oxford,
and has drummed classics into the heads ot
Adelaide and Auckland undergrads. Dettmann
came from Maoriland, where he was high
among the professors, to his present job eight
years ago. H’e is keen on games as well as
culture, and is a witty after-dinner speaker.
David Watterston, one of the veterans
of Australian journalism, has gone west.
Born in Scotland 86 years ago, he came to
Victoria with his parents at the age of seven.
He began his newspaper work as a young
man on the Ipswich (Q.) “Herald,” returned
to Melbourne still in his early twenties and
joined the staff of the “Argus.” The con-
nection w 7 as to last for nearly 60 years. For
18 of them (’B5 to ’O3) the “Australasian”
had an exceptionally capable head in Watter-
ston, and he gave up the job to take the
helm of the “Argus” for another three years.
After that he was associated w 7 ith the man-
agement of both papers, until his retirement
three years ago.
Monsignor O’Harau, who was buried 111
a presentation block in Waverley (Sydjiey)
cemetery, left an estate valued at £12,857 in
a will so mildewed as to be almost indeci-
pherable. A sister in Glasgow is to receive
£lOO per year, whilst his rights in three
ancestral farms go to his nephews. _ Local
charities get the residue, the Cardinal’s Col-
lege at Manly and its subsidiary at Spring-
wood (N.S.W.) being among the bene-
ficiaries, while a permanent annual prize for
Irish history is provided.
George Alexander Hobler, F.R.G.S., mem-
ber of the defunct North Australia Commis-
sion, is mentioned as a possible opponent
of Nelson for the voteless Territory seat
at next elections. Hobler was born on the
Daw’son River in Queensland, qualified as
a civil engineer, joined the State railway
service in 1878, and notched up a fine record
before becoming chief engineer of the Com-
monwealth Railways. He might have done
just as good work for the Territory but for
the shackles that lay like a dead hand upon
the commission.
John William Macdonald, Public Trustee
of Maoriland, has charge of over £50,000,000
of other people’s money and is a_ mortgagee
to the extent of close on £20,000,000. During
his ten years as boss the office has handed
over to the Consolidated Fund liaif
its profits, which aggregated £378,000.
Macdonald, who is 48, was born in Christ-
church and spent his boyhood days in Timaru.
For a while he followed the Inky Way, and
then found a berth in the Justice Department.
M.L. Public Trustee MACDONALD.
He qualified as a gent, one, and entered the
Public Trust Office a quarter of a century
ago as assistant solicitor. For some years
he edited the “Public Service Journal.” Two
or three years ago Macdonald inaugurated
the Common Fund, a pool which guarantees
a fixed l’ate of interest (varied from time to
time) to investors, an innovation that has
created much interest in financial circles all
the world over.
Low knew Henry Lawson better than
George Lambert did: and the Henry of this
sketch is a truer Henry than the bronze
statue which was unveiled yesterday in the
Sydney Domain. Maybe no bronze could do
justice to Henry Lawson; for dull metal can-
not capture the flash of the eye which was the
first thing that struck those who met him.
HENRY LAWSON.
Other old friends of his think they might
hav e spared him the sheep-dog. For Lawson
was no sheep-man ; fie would be far likelier
to have with him some poor hungry mongrel
which had followed him after he had spent
his last copper in buying it a meat-pie.
Australia has lost one of its foremost gem-
experts in T. C. Wollaston, dead in Adel-
aide at 68. He was a Survey Office
clerk when garnets were discovered in
the Macdonnell Ranges and his ener-
gies took a new direction. Quite 20
journeys about the world he made, acquir-
ing knowledge of precious stones and push-
ing the interests of our own. Tasmanian
emeralds, Westralian pearls and S.A. rubies
proved eventually a mere side-line to his
special care, the opal of White Cliffs and
elsewhere and the so-called “black” opal
of Queensland. Wollaston’s book on that
stone is a classic; so is his w 7 ork on the
wattle and other native shrubs.
Tasmania has had an educational system
comparable to those of the other States for
only 25 years. It possessed no State secon-
dary school or training college for teachers
until the year before the war, when Hobart
State High was started as an experiment,
with a highly capable ex-Soustralian, I’. 11.
Mitchell, as principal, and 200 pupils. The
other day Mitchell retired to take up an
inspectorship, and had to listen to the cheers
of 650 pupils. The school in the last 14 of
the IS years has had extraordinary results.
Incidentally, it was another Soustralian who
laid the foundations of the Speck’s present
system. But. W. L. Neale had less tact than
energy; and he couldn’t stand up against the
host of his enemies. For all that, his name
must not be allowed to fade out of Tas-
mania’s memory.
J. A. Browne, dead in Brisbane at 79, was
one of the old squattocracy, fast vanishing.
Born in Tasmania, where his father was a
British soldier, he came to Queensland when
seven years old, and in his time owned many
well-known stations. A foundation member
of the Queensland Gattlegrowers’ Associa-
tion, he was an acknowledged authority on
beef cattle all over Australia.
The storekeeping firm of A. Lesser and
Co., of Coleraine, has ■ taken down its sign
after 75 years. A sigh of regret will escape
from many old hands in western Vic., from
the S.A; border to the sea.
“The O’D.” ; In from the back o’ Bourke
the other day, to have a sore foot patched
up at Dubbo (N.S.W.) hospital, came
Gould Mahomet, an Afghan, who claims to
be 123. He arrived in Australia with one of
the first droves of ' camels imported for
carrying wool over the long, dry stretches
beyond Bourke, and was “Old Gould
Mahomet” as far back as the dwellers along
the border fence can remember. Nobody out
there doubts he is as old as he says he is.
Gould looks good for another 20 years.
Sydney lias lost, on his retirement to Lid-
combe State Home, a University man who
sold newspapers for a living. Son. of tui
Anglican parson, he took honors at Cam-
bridge, and was subsequently appointed to
a lectureship at Melbourne Uni., w’here his
advanced views brought him into conflict
with the authorities. Resigning his job, he
proclaimed himself an advocate of the simple
life, took to hawking music, and finally got
down to paper-selling. His bushy whiskers
were a feature of the Market-George street
corner for some years.

Supplies from Maitland were resumed over
a year ago, and the price of coal was reduced;
yet Melbourne gas consumers got no relief
until Sept, last, because the co. had to make
chartering arrangements four months and
more ahead. It had been charging 7s. 6d. per
1000 c.f., sd. of which was set against
the added cost of imported supplies. Under
the new scale the rates range from ss. lid.
to 7s. 3d. per thousand according to monthly
consumption.
This and a shrinkage of 7 p.c. in consump-
tion (3905 million cubic feet) resulted in
a drop of £176,503 in gas sales for the 12
months to June 30. Also, the return from
residuals was £63,440 lighter, making the
contraction in revenue £239,943. Neverthe-
less, the board was able to show £67,037
more profit, repeat the nominal 13 p.c. div.,
rub £64,702 off the book value of old plant
and put £28,435 in the cupboard. All this
•oecause of savings aggregating £353,893 in
manufacturing and distributing exes., due
partly to improved methods, and largely to
the lower price and carbonising qualities of
Maitland coal.
The following analysis of revenue account
figures shows precisely what has happened :

Of the growth of £73,065 in other charges,
£31,647 was on account of taxation
(£75,077) . Altogether the net gain was 3!d.
per 1000 c.f. A disappointing feature is the
drop in returns from residuals ; had they been
on the same scale as the previous year’s
another 3d. per 1000 c.f. could have been
knocked off the price to the consumer. How-
ever, owing to the slackness in industry and
curtailed expenditure of the Country Roads
Board, the demand for both coke and tar fell
away, despite a cut in prices. But now that
the co. has standardised its bitumen output
to Government requirements better sales are
expected.
No specific provision is made for depre-
ciation ; much, therefore, depends upon
whether expenditure on repairs and renewals
(£273,812 last year, or £34,129 more than
for the preceding 12 months) proves to be
sufficient to cover actual wear and tear. It
has not covered obsolescence, on account of
which £173,486 has been struck off over the
last. 3| years.
There was no change of importance in
balance-sheet figures. At the close of accounts
paid capital was £1,300,000; it had brought
with it £819,201 of share premiums. The
debenture debt, bearing interest at from 4 p.c.
to 8 p.c., totalled £2,119,200, and there was
£353,008 coming to sundry creditors. Book
debts, cash, etc., figured at £562,287; stocks,
£208,405; fixed assets, £3,998,193.
The div., which was lifted a couple of
points to 15 p.c. in 1924, dropped to 13 p.c.
again four years later, and nothing better
than the lower rate need be looked for. It
is, however, worth only 6.1 p.c. on all shares
sold during the last 50 years, the average
price realised being £lO 10s. 3d. The market
now prices the £5 paids at £8 125.; the
return at that figure is 7.5 p.c. at the pre-
sent rate of distribution.

Encouraged by the rapid growth of the busi-
ness and the fine results won during the
boom years, this Sydney wholesale ice-cream
vendor spread to Queensland in 1927. Early
success there sent Melbourne and Pel’th
rushing for the shares when the Vic. and
W.A. cos. were put on the market; for
200,000 £1 shares in the Vic. co. no less
than £2,290,000 was offered. But before
the pups could get into their stride the boom
burst, the public has become more careful
of the fewer pence in its pocket, and that
care is likely to grow. Thus both the parent
and the pups have experienced a sharp con-
traction of turnover; the pups have passed
their dividends, and are not likely to turn
out the investment they were originally
expected to be. Hence £85,000 of the re-
serves have been earmarked to provide
against possible losses on investments with
a book value of £155,755, of which £94,200
represents holdings in the subsidiaries.
The parent, however, lias a pretty firm grip
upon its market. Nevertheless, last year’s
declared net earnings slipped £21,523; they
were 10.2 p.c. on average capital compared
with 15.5, 19, 18, 19.7, 19.1 and 17.9 p.c.
back to 1925, so points were knocked
off the div., reducing it to 10 p.c. The
narrow margin and the trend of earnings
and exes., including taxation, suggest that
the 10 p.c. is not likely to be maintained ;
though the board says it has dealt conser-
vatively with the figures, and the large unex-
plained additions to reserves give color to
the claim. The £35,444 thus set aside in
the last term was £45,988 lighter than the
previous year’s contribution, which included
£20,000 on account of scrip received for the
sale of the co.’s Westralian rights. At the
close of last accounts the general, taxation
and depreciation reserves were lumped at
£431,799, equal to 93.3 p.c. of the book value
of the plant. The amount intended to cover
loss of capital through wear and tear, etc.,
could with advantage be stated definitely.

The year’s surplus earnings and the reduc-
tion of £10,740 in book debts enabled the
board to wipe £10,031 off the amount coming
to sundry creditors, add £23,484 to the book
value of fixed assets and £6704 to invest-
ments, stocks and cash. The more or less
liquid surplus (£73,253) was £2550 stronger
than at the previous balance.
There are 680,611 £1 shares, of which
511,364 are paid to 155., and the balance to
ss. The market prices the 15s. paids at
19s. 3d. as against 245. 6d. a year ago. At
the lower figure the return is 7.8 p.c. on a
10 p.c. div. basis, or 6.2 p.c. should the rate
of distribution be dropped to 8 p.c. Includ-
ing the depreciation, etc., reserves, the net
tangible backing is 435. 2d. per pound of
paid capital.

Formed by the Carpenters in 1914, this
island trading and finance co. plodded quietly
along during the war years, building up
connections in the Solomons and New
Guinea. Then high prices and the develop-
ment of the Mandated Territory provided
it with new opportunities, of which an alert
management made the most.
To finance the brisk expansion of the busi-
ness £200,000 of fresh scrip has been issued
since 1923, making paid capital £301,667;
there is another £83,333 at call. Borne splen-
did results have been won; but the board,
mindful of the lessons of the short, sharp
post-war slump, determined to build solidly.
So the div. has been kept at 8 p.c., and
not far short of half the admitted net earn-
ings over the last nine years have remained
in the business, lifting reserves to £122,345
at the close of last accounts; also, liberal
provision is known to have been made for
contingencies internally.
Though mining activities have helped the
co.’s turnover in New Guinea, the London
price of copra tumbled from £27 a ton
in June, 1928, to £2O a year later, and to
£lO when the books last closed, and mer-
chandise values generally eased. Still, the
visible slip in last year’s gross profit
(£54,165) was only £1542. Exes. (£16,452)
were £925 heavier, leaving the net result at
12.5 p.c. on average capital compared with
14.6, 20, 19, 17.1, 18.2 and 14.8 p.c. back
to 1924.
Thus, though the outlook is obscure, there
is still a comfortable margin between earn-
ings and distributions, and the chairman,
who sees signs of a partial revival, is con-
fident that the co. will “maintain its posh
tion.” iCopra is now fetching £l2, and over-
production of whale oil, which broke down
the copra market, is presently expected to
work its own cure. Meantime, chief danger
lies in the possibilities of frozen credits and
bad debts. f
Here is so much as balance-sheet figures

Including branch balances and mortgages,
tbe year’s improvement in the more or less
liquid surplus (£419,253) was £16,772. The
actual position depends mainly upon the
state of affairs at the. branches, whose
balances only are disclosed in the parent’s
sheet.
The pound shares, covered by 28s. Id. in
net tangibles, have been steady around 265.
on the market for the last 12 months. The
return at 265. is 6.1 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div.
basis. In shareholders’ hands divs. are free

Shareholders have averaged a shade over 10
p.c. since the. beginning, 23 years ago. In
1920 the. business was split into half a dozen
subsidiaries, which took over the parent’s
assets, except its t.-p. debtors’ balances and
freeholds; the latter werb leased to the pups.
The object was to avoid restriction of the
co.’s motor-agency rights ; but owing to the
vicissitudes of the trade four of the sub-
sidiaries have since put up the shutters,
though apparently without loss to the parent.
As money became available it was invested
outside the motor trade, largely in Govern-
ment and other Stock Exchange securities;
thus the parent has transformed itself into a
holding, finance and investment co.
It put by more than was distributed in
the fat years, and the £156,905 of capital
had the support and assistance of £173,374 of
reserves at June 30. That is to say, a 10
p.c. div. would then call for but 4.7 p.c. on
capital and reserves combined. Since last
year’s profit was only a. trifle more than
that, and with a further contraction of net
earnings in prospect, a repetition of the
10 p,c. div. is too much to expect for the
current term. During the 12 months to June
30 the slip in gross earnings (£33,150) was
£7254, which was partly offset by a saving of
£&143 in exes. (£17,138) ; ‘leaving the
not result at 10.2 p.c. on capital as against
12.9, 16.6, 24.2, 35.4 and 52.6 p.c. back to
1926.
The market’s opinion is that the pound
shares, covered by net tangibles with a book
value of 425. Id., are worth 225. as against
235. 6d. 12 months ago. The return at the
lower figure is 9.1 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div.
basis, or 7.3 p.c. should the rate of distribu-
tion drop to 8 p.c.
As from Oct. 31 last the co. relinquished
General Motors franchise, and took over the
agency for Morris cars for the whole of
Queensland and the Northern Rivers 'of
N. S. Wales. This will be worked by the
two subsidiaries, one in Brisbane and the
other in Toowoomba, which have bought
South Queensland Motors’ stock of Morris
cars, and over whose figures the curtain is

Though the grouping obscures the real posi-
tion, finances are obviously comfortable.
There was no change worth mentioning in
the more or less liquid surplus (£282,321 at
June 30), which included £107,000 of Gov-
ernment securities. The shrinkage in the
market value of these and other investments, ;
however, may affect book values; much
depends upon the size of the internal pro-
vision for contingencies.

During the 12 months covered by the latest
accounts Maoriland’s coastal ships carried
oyer 23 p.c. less cargo than in the previous
year. This co., which has been trading on
the east coast since the eighties of last
century, appears to have shared very fully
in the general experience. After providing
for insurance, repairs, etc., the board put
the year’s profit at £4518. But there was
an unexplained .reduction of £3501 in the
insurance accounts (now £70,740), thus re-
ducing the visible profit to £lOl7. As "for
the boilers and repairs account, it dis-
appeared after the books closed in 1928,
when it stood at £10,505. The next balance
disclosed a growth of £18,518 in outside
liabilities, which was offset by a net increase
of only £8490 in total assets; so you can
make a pretty good guess as to what was
done with this fund. Last year’s growth
in liabilities was £25,001, due partly to
the purchase of a new ship. At any
rate, the board considered that it was not
overdoing things by handing out a final div.
at: the rate of 6 p.c. p.a., making 7 p.c. for
the year, though visibly reserves were tapped
for £10,281 to do it.
Shareholders, however, have never had
anything attractive from the business; after
a long run of 7 p.c. divs. 8 p.c. was paid
for the seven years to the end of Sept., 1930.
The extension of railways and the growth
of motor transport have changed the out-
look so far as passenger traffic is concerned;
results, therefore, will depend mainly upon
freight, earnings and the extent to which
overhead can be restrained. Now that efforts
are being made to lower the cost of distri-
bution, the 6 p.c. div. is doubtful.
Balance-sheet figures compare as follows:

The Metropole caters largely for country
visitors, many of whom, owing to the sharp
drop in the price of our staples, abandoned
their visit to the city during the 12 months
covered by the latest, accounts. This and
the lighter pay-rolls of the metropolis, where
unemployment continues to grow apace,
affected the bar trade, too. There was thus
a sharp contraction of turnover, to which a
cut in charges also contributed, while mount-
ing taxation pressed heavily upon the attenu-
ated earnings, and threatens to press more
heavily still.
So, after meeting all outgoings, including
the cost of some structural additions, and
striking off £2312 more than was spent on
fixed assets, the board put net profit £16,173
short of the previous year’s, 3.7 p.c. on
capital as against 11.4, 11.4, 11.3, 12.3 and
12.1 p.c. back to 1926, and dropped the div.
to p.c. For the 20 years to the end .of
1929 a steady 10 , p.c. was paid, sweetened
with £75,000 of bonus scrip and special cash
distributions totalling £67,500. What the
future holds it is, of course, impossible to
say. The management claims to be giving
better service at reduced cost, and that should
help. Still, we have entered upon a period
of readjustment in which the burden of
frozen credits, taxation, unemployment and
the stubbornness of overhead will retard
profit-earning.
About three years ago a new wing was
added, providing accommodation for an extra
170 guests, making the total capacity 500.
The next table shows how the work was

The £60,000 of fresh capital brought with
it £15,573 of share premiums, which were
added to reserves. Fixed assets are reported
in excellent condition, and much depends
upon that. The year’s surplus earnings and
the reduction in stocks, book debts, etc.,
enabled £8127 to be snipped off the debt,
reducing it to £24,634 in excess of the more
or less liquids, the improvement over .the
last two years was £7999.
On the market the pound shares fetch 14s.
as against 265. a year ago. They are covered
by net tangibles with a book value of
255. lid., all represented by premises, etc.,
worth what they can earn.
Babinda Central Mill (Q.)
This farmers’ sugar-mill operates at
Babinda, 18 miles north of Innisfail (N.Q.).
S. H. Warner, also chairman of the Mul-
grave, at Gordonvale, heads the board. The
1930 crop was a record ; it was 10,092 tons
above the 1929 figure, and 8845 tons was
sent to the Mulgrave, Babinda crushing
212,605 tons. The c.c.s. (14.9 p.c.) was 0.3
p.c. lower, and the outturn of sugar 583
tons lighter at 31,311 tons, which was
passed on to the G.S.R. for refining and
marketing. Shareholders, who are also
growers, get no divs., profits being distri-
buted through the price paid for cane. Last
year it was 435. a ton on a £l9-a-ton basis
for raw .sugar, and upon the final price
being declared at £l9 13s. Id. another small
distribution was paid. Sugar sales, etc.,
brought in £618,282 for the 12 months to
March 31, and £474,755 was paid to grow-
ers. Exes., including £1385 for deprecia-
tion, ran off with £141,905.
Paid capital is £327,512 ; it increased £26,177
during the year, and the co. paid that
amount off its loan from the Queensland
Government, reducing it to £78,810. Other
creditors figure at £61,875. Depreciation
reserve appears at. £102,730, insurance
reserve at £47,077, and p. and 1. balance
£4248. Principal asset is the mill (£266,023) ,
the book value of which was practically
unchanged during the year. On tram-
ways and rolling stock (£195,066) £6600
was spent over the term. Other plant and
stores figured at £18,062. Debtors (£52,803)
include £48.233 due from the iC.S.R. Includ-
ing £47,077 of Commonwealth and Queens-
land Government securities, and £30,387 of
cash, liquids total £130,266. Including the
co.’s debt to the Queensland Government,
there is thus an excess of liabilities amount-
ing to £10,419, though that is not likely
to cause the board much worry.
The co. owns £4166 of shares in the Aus-
tralian National Power Alcohol Co., Sarina,
which, though technically successful, has nor
yet the output or the market to ensure
steady profits. There are two main
obstacles in the way, first of which is the
inadequate supply of sugar-cane residues,
and the second is the difficulty of extending
co-operative marketing with petrol com-
panies. Whether it would be economical
to treat “B” syrups for alcohol is at present
being considered.
Crushings at Babinda for the current
term are estimated at 225,000 tons. The
season generally in Queensland is favorable,
and large tonnages are expected, which
means a bigger surplus for export, with
consequent lower average prices. Experts

LOVELY seventeen —the apple of your eye, and, provided
you live, assured of every comfort. Have you considered
how she would fare if you were to die?
Would you leave her enough to live on? Apart from
what you will be able to leave your wife, wouldn’t it be a fine
thing to ensure that your daughter will inherit £3OOO, that
would give her an income of £3 a week? Wouldn’t it be a
comfort to you and your wife to know that you had made
this reasonable provision?
A man of 40, in good health, can make this provision for
his daughter immediately, by paying an annual premium of
less than two pounds a week.
The amount insured will grow, with bonuses, each year
that the policy is in force, and his daughter’s prospective
income will grow with the bonuses.

£25,000 in 9 p.c. cum. prefs. was put up
locally, the parent took 15,000 fully-paid
ords. for rights, and put up cash for 25,000
(paid to 155.) ; there is thus £6250 uncalled.
Plant to manufacture swimming suits was
brought from America in June, 1928, and the
factory, which had been put up at Lidcombe,
near Sydney, was running within a month.
For a while demand ran ahead of produc-
tion, owing to early difficulties with the
machines. However, after capitalising £1634
of preliminary exes., £305 more than the
prefs. called for was netted in the first, eight
months; in the following term there was
enough to show 17.4 p.c. on the ordinary
capital, but no div. was paid. During the
12 months covered by the latest accounts
turnover sprang 30 p.c., and gross profits
(£46,552) improved £10,145; but after pro-
viding for the recession in stock values and
heavier taxation, exes, took all the increase
and £272 besides. After the prefs. had re-
ceived their £2250, the balance was 16.6 p.c.
ou ord. capital, and a 4 p.c. div. was paid.
The remaining £4267 reduced the amount off
capital unrepresented by tangibles to £6173
at March 31.
Finances are snug:—
1929. 1930. 1931.
Paid capital .. . . £52,500 £58,750 £58,750
Sundry creditors .. 3,189 7,061 9,173

Book debts . . .. 2,120 1,157 1,080
Cash, etc 3,353 15,592 22,376
The year’s improvement in the more or less
liquid surplus (£28,467, including stocks)
was £5522. At March 31 cash, etc., alone
was sufficient to meet the outside debt and
pay over five years’ pref. divs. as well.
The prefs., which have priority as to capi-
tal, were covered by net tangibles with a
book value of 475., approximately half of
which was in surplus liquids. Last year’s
profit was nearly 3£ times their annual require-
ments, and a good volume of business for -die
current term is said to be assured, though
prices continue to ease. Doubtful of the
future, the market prices the scrip at 215.;
the return at that figure is 8.6 p.c.
Illicit Silver Trading in Maoriland
Maorilanders are much exercised on the
subject of silver coinage. The banks get
their supplies from the London Mint, and
though silver is legal-tender up to 40s. only,
the fact that these coins are Imperial cur-
rency and worth more, by the current rate
of exchange, than M.L. bank notes, and
correspondingly more than Commonwealth
notes, has led to a strong demand for them
for profit-making purposes. An Order-in-
Gouncil was made on April 2 prohibiting
the “export” of silver coin, and an enterpris-
ing Australian who boarded the Ulimaroa
with £430 of it in his possession was prose-
cuted and fined £25. This Australian,
it was suggested by the prosecution,
took Australian silver coins to the Dominion
and converted them, by means best known
to himself, into English. Actually he was
taking out of the country less silver than it
is alleged he brought in, for the silver content
of the English coinage is 50 per cent, of
weight, and of the Australian 92.5 per cent.
Counsel for the Crown contended that “silver
coin is a token coinage intended for- internal
circulation only.” But it is not only an
offence to take silver coin out of M.L. It
is also an offence to bring it in, as a Sydney
woman found to her cost when arrested in
an Auckland hotel with £lOOO of Australian
silver in her possession. She was remanded
on heavy bail.
Transactions for exchange-profit of the
class concerned in these prosecutions are
blamed by the banks for the drain of silver
coin from their tills; but there are other rea-
sons. M.L. normally lias in circulation
£1,500,000 of silver money, which ordinarily
is quite adequate. But recently there has
been a fairly general 10 per cent, cut in
wages and salaries, which means that a lot
more silver is required in the weekly pay-
bags, the need in that respect being intensi-
fied liy the discontinuance of the banks of
the issue of 10s. notes since the middle of
last year, when the note-tax was raised from
3 per cent, to 4£ per cent.
The Dominion could turn an honest penny
by minting its own silver. About £150,000
worth of silver would be sufficient to replace
the £1,500,000 worth of British tokens; and
the existing coinage could be disposed of at
a handsome exchange premium.
The prospectus of Community Farming
Settlements, Ltd., has been issued: of the
three directors one is Dr. Arthur, the other
the Rev. Hammond, two sincere and hard-
working philanthropists. The idea is to
acquire about 220 acres near Riverstone, a
few miles outside Sydney, at £6 16s. 4d. an
acre, and settle 30 boys on it, training them
and helping them on to farmlets. It is
reckoned the whole thing can be done for
about £4000; and it is thought that investors
could do some families a good turn and earn
5 p.c. p.a. The selection of the land is all-
important. It is said that “the property
under option is suitable for the purpose”;
but more than that general statement is
required. The Department of Agriculture
has specialists whose services would no
doubt be placed at the disposal of the
promoters.

“Copperfield”: Excitement still runs high
at Canoona, where additional finds of gold
have been made, and claims are being pegged
all over the place. The first, find was obvi-
ously a pocket forced out of the serpentine,
there being no trace of a reef; it is expected
that further deposits of the kind will be dis-
covered as the ground is turned over. How-
ever, two men have struck the cap of what
is described as a defined lode some 18 inches
below the grass. The stone showed free
gold, and has given rich yields after dolly-
ing and panning in Rockhampton. But
there is no proof yet that the formation is
very important. It is 73 years ago this
month since Canoona, which is about 30
miles up the Fitzroy River from Rockhamp-
ton, was discovered by a Cornishman named
Chappie. Some 15,000 men made for the
spot, and thus founded Rockhampton as a
port, its rival, Gladstone, being practically
abandoned. Though a considerable amount
of gold was got at Canoona, the field did not
last long. Feeling ran high against Chappie,
but the wily Cousin Jack took the hint and
skipped before trouble arrived.

“Pera Head” : For a long time past gold
has been got in fair quantities on the Batavia
River, which runs into the Gulf of Carpen-
taria. The field was discovered as far back
as 1892 by William Baird, an associate of
Dick Daintree. Some thousands of ounces
were got out in the first rush, but the inacces-
sibility of the spot and the hostility of the
blacks —they killed Baird —caused it to be
temporarily abandoned. Then the discovery
of a new location, Plutoville, by an abb. of
those parts, started a fresh rush, and the field
has had desultory attention ever since. A ;
feature of the early Batavia was the nug-
getty nature of the gold found. Recently
the Queensland Mines Department dispatched
a surveyor to lay out a road and to report
on the field. He says that prospects are
promising, that several claims are being suc-
cessfully worked, most of them as deep as j
75ft. on the lead. Water is coming in here 1
and is hampering output. This difficulty
should be overcome when completion of the
road permits transport of the necessary
equipment.
* * * :!:
A, lode 4ft. wide has been struck a couple
of feet below the surface near the old work-
ings of the Little Wonder at Beaconsfield
(Tas.). Many believe this to be a continua-
tion of the Tasmania reef, which yielded over
£3,000,000 worth of gold. The discovery was
made by Messrs. Stone and Clay from an old
trench, cut by the Little Wonder co., which
passed within 2ft. of the reef. Assay values
of the stone are awaited with interest;
meanwhile there is a rush to secure ground
in the neighborhood.

Westralia’s gold production for the first
half of this year was 225,283 fine ounces
as against 196,0550 z. and 181,7470 z. for the
corresponding half of 1930 and 1929 respec-
tively. The premium paid on the output for
the six months to June 30 was £275,832, or
an average of £1 4s. 9d. per ounce. The
State’s total production to June 30 aggre-
gates 38,529,0990 z., valued at £163,661,108.

During its palmy days Sons of Gwalia
(W.A.), once managed by President Hoover,
paid £1,128,488 in divs., but shareholders
have not had a cheque since a fire destroyed
most of the plant over 10 yearsi ago. Still,
there are prospects. Recent developments
have disclosed a nice block of payable ore,
and £lO,OOO of £68,000 advanced by the Gov-
ernment about three years ago has been
repaid. Last month the co. treated 12,684
tons of ore and sands for £14,625, of which
exes, made off with £13,326, or 225. Id. per
ton.

Walker Bros, at Eureka, in the Cue dis-
trict (W.A.), recently got 263.70 z. and
27.350 z. fine gold from two sample crushings
of 1801 b. and 501 b. respectively. They have
since struck another patch which has yielded
llOOoz. from about as many pounds of stone
The results of a bulk crushing are eagerly
awaited; but the nearest Government bat-
tery is booked well ahead.
THE CONVERSION LOAN.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Which are likely to be worth most in the
market, the longer or shorter dated loans
carrying equal interest? —4767.
The sooner the cash is payable on a low
interest-bearing stock, the higher the quota-
tion. Therefore the early maturities should
be worth most.
My aged parents propose to notify their
dissent. To postpone payment will rob them
of the money they had intended to live upon.
•To whom must the notice be addressed? —
4830 a.
Of course you might sell the stock after
conversion; so conversion doesn’t mean that
the principal is tied up irretrievably for
years. It is quite possible that the market
price of converted stock will be higher than
that of unconverted bearing the same
nominal rate of interest: the latter will be
subject to any tax which it may be decided
that it shall carry, whereas the interest on
new securities is to be free from (1) every
State income tax, (2) the 7-?>' p.c. Common-
wealth “further” tax (imposed last year),
(3) any and every Commonwealth income
tax higher than existing taxes, not counting
the “further” tax as an existing tax. Notice
of dissent is to be given—in the case of
securities issued by the Commonwealth to
the Registrar of Inscribed Stock at the
Commonwealth Bank in any State capital or
at Launceston, Rockhampton and Towns-
ville ; in the case of State securities, to the
Treasury of the State concerned. But if a
bank holds the security, for safe custody or
otherwise, notice of dissent must be given
to the bank.
I hold Queensland Government 61 per
cents., redeemable 1936 or earlier at Gov-
ernment's option. (1) Have 1 the right to
choose the term of the new loan? (2) If
I dissent will the loan be redeemable before
1936?— 4781.
(1) No; but holders of £3OO or less will,
it is understood, be able to convert to the
1938 maturity; holders of £3OO to £5OO may
convert half to ’3B and half to ’4l maturity;
ditto £5OO to £lOOO, to ’3B, ’4l and ’44 matu-
rities ; over £lOOO will be divided into the
10 currencies. (2) Very unlikely to be.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
I am cyaniding a clean free milling ore,
and adding lime to the vats. What is the
necessary percentage of protective alkali.
Best standard acid solutions, and their
equivalents to lime? Any practical books
of chemistry, which show how equations are
arrived at, and would be of assistance in
making up and testing solutions? —426o.
If the sample is a clean, free milling ore,
as stated, the acidity should cause little or
no trouble. Sufficient lime should be added
to make the solutions alkaline ; a slight excess
of lime will not interfere with the reaction.
There is no necessity to use standard acid
solutions on the field. You can test for
acidity or alkalinity by means of indicator
testbooks. Blue litmus paper when added to
a solution which is acid will change color to
red. If red litmus paper is placed in ai cyanide
solution, which contains sufficient lime to pro-
duce an alkaline reaction, the paper will
turn blue. A good book on cyanide treat-
ment is by Julian and Smart, “Cyaniding
Gold and Silver Ores” (about 35s.'' Litmus
books mentioned above are about 4d. each.
Has The Bulletin any concrete proof
of the common statement that cost of living
has fallen 20 p.c.?— 4586.
This question comes from Geelong. The
Government Statistician’s figures show that
the retail price index-numbers for food,
groceries and housing (4 and 5 rooms) at
that town in 1929 (whole year) were 985.
The same numbers for the first quarter of
1931 were 820. The reduction for that period
has thus been between 16 and 17 p.c.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
Small Investor: Not unless tlie exclusion
would involve definite hardship... .Cos: (1) Middling.
(2) No. .. .E.L.M.P.: (1) Rates varied with risk;
average 7 p.c. (2) Nothing settled, but a 1 p.e.
reduction has been vaguely promised.


THE INCOMPETENT COTTER.
“Premier Lang spends most of his time, these days, trying to raise money on assets he has ruined from people he has slandered.”
The cot was a detached one;
The place with debts was rank;
And ev’rything about that cot
Was mortgaged to the bank.
THE WAY-OUT PAGE.
Appeal to the Native-born
Dear Bulletin,— “L. Chevalley” (B.
8/7/’8l) has been unfortunate in his attempt
to employ some of The Bulletin’s 100,000.
It is hard to believe that .out of eight indi-
viduals who, apparently, followed each other
in rotation not one was even middling-gOod.
The point is, were they native-born Austra-
lians, or were they samples of that grouch-
ing material with which well-mean mg but
misguided persons have cumbered this coun-
try from overseas?
I have traversed Eastern Australia from
Wilson’s Promontory to Cape York, starv-
ing or prospering in accordance with the
leanness or fatness of the times. I have
humped my drum in company of tinkers;
tailors, soldiers and sailors, men rich in
hope but poor in gear. I have consorted
with beggar-men and thieves; but seldom
have I met a native-born wanderer who was
incapable of holding down whatever job he
turned his hand to. No! Amongst the un-
employed sons of our own soil there are
very few unemployables.
I hope my motives will be understood if
1 quote my own experience. In 1902, after
bolting from home, I lobbed in western
N.S.W. in drought-time and took a job as
cook in a travelling chaff-cutting gang. This
was followed by spells of mail- and bread-
cart driving, to be succeeded by assorted
jobs too numerous to mention. Since about
1910 I have been a schoolteacher, with an
interval of three years in the world war;
and there are thousands in every State even
more capable than I was. My son, aged
19, after winning a scholarship, secured a
position with the Main Roads Board. After
sticking at it for nearly two years he com-
plained that the starched collars cut his
throat, and chucked the job. For nearly a
year now he has been working on a fruit-
farm, giving satisfaction and liking the work.
Some few weeks ago his employer told him
that owing to a. failure in “small crops”
he would have to discharge him. The lad
offered to stay without pay until times
changed; and the boss accepted the offer.
What we need to do is to appeal to the
native-born. They are such easy-going fel-
lows they have let the more cunning rats
from outside get hold of the unions and the
trades halls. If the native-born would but
assert themselves, things would change in
a week.—Your.s, E. M. L.
Pay Up!
Dear Bulletin,— Personally, I know the
building trades best. In normal times the
margin of profit on contracts allowed of our
carrying on the books a certain percentage
of long-winded and doubtful payers. I know
of two men in a small way who’ve now been
forced to push their few employees on to
the dole, unable any further to pay wages
for work they are themselves unable to
secure payment for. Both tell the same
story—that small clients, known to be up
against it, will only ask for work to be done
that they can pay for, the worst offenders
being professional and business men, who
are adopting the all-too-common slogan of
“Pay. nobody !” Of course a man can always
resort to debt-collectors, but their fees of
10 per cent, and more absorb all profit in
many cases. Motor-garages have their black-
lists of defaulters and bad-pays, and they
include names one would never expect to
find there. In these times similar lists in
other industries would prove a blessing to
hundreds still battling to keep loyal em-
ployees and themselves off the dole. —Yours,
Morita.
The Part of the Banks
Dear B., —We are all so busy telling the
other fellow what his duty is that we are
apt to forget our own. For , several months
we have had heads of the trading banks
preaching the gospel of lower costs in pro-
duction and appealing to Governments and
individuals to curtail expenditure and share
in the general sacrifice. This, is all right.
But what are the trading banks doing to-
wards lowering production costs, and: what
share are they taking in the sacrificed
High interest rates are the greatest “slug”
on production, and the producer gets both
barrels in having to pay them directly on
mortgages and overdrafts, and indirectly on
the higher costs of the commodities he uses.
The Commonwealth Bank has announced a
reduction of 1 per cent, on interest rates as
from July 1; and the chairman of that bank
is not the man to do rash deeds. Now' the
trading banks are explaining why they can-
not follow suit until the lower rates of
interest on fixed deposits become effective
and their employees get a 10 p.c. cut in their
salaries. Where, then, does the banks’ “sac-
rifice” come in if the depositors and high-
collars are to get the dirty end of the stick'/
I’m not a Bolshevik or a Communist:
men on the land are not. But the attitude
taken up by the trading banks will make us
scratch our heads, and if the Lunatic-at-
large goes to the country with some fantastic
policy of “disciplining” the banks and other
financial institutions, he will snare a lot
of votes which would never come his way
if the banks played the game.—Yours,
Valerin.
The Payment of Members
Dear Bulletin, —Some years ago when,
aided by extravagant borrowing, there w r as
apparent prosperity, Federal politicians,
without reference to the taxpayers, increased
their salaries by 66 per cent., adding nearly
£50.000 p.a. to the cost of government. The
nation’s adversity now offers them the oppor-
tunity to show their patriotism and set a
worthy example in rehabilitation by volun-
tarily reducing their salaries to the £6OO p.a.
originally provided, thus saving the annual
interest on one of the borrowed millions.
So far no political party in either House
has been sufficiently patriotic to propose the
abandonment of the super-salary. Assum-
ing they are included in the all-round 20
p.c. reduction scheme, they will still be in
receipt of £2OO p.a. more than the amount
originally provided by the framers of the
Constitution, who saw the danger of making
the politician a full-time paid, .professional,
absorbed in catching the votes of his con-
stituents at the next election in utter dis-
regard of the nation’s welfare. This class
of politician has cost us countless millions
and brought the nation to the brink of
default. Through him, and by his machina-
tions, we have the accursed bounty system,
a prohibitive tariff, pensions for thousands
not entitled to them, the Arbitration Act
(with its attendant unemployment), unpay-
able' branch railways, thousands travelling
on free passes, numerous unpayable national
services (ships, cattle-stations, hotels, retail
shops, etc.) and scores of methods of wast-
ing money in the constituencies to catch votes.
The remedy lies in getting rid of the full-
time paid professional vote-catcher, and
substituting payment only for the time occu-
pied in attending Parliament plus the travel-
ling expenses connected therewith. —Yours
etc., Edward T. Miles.
Finding Employment
Dear Bulletin,— A little while ago I set
about establishing a small manufacturing
business which promised to provide employ-
ment for an increasing number of girls.
But no sooner was my intention announced
at the Government office than my troubles
began. It rained regulations, some of them
so absurd that an honest attempt to carry
them out was utterly impracticable. But
what finally stuck me up was that I would
have to pay the bulk of my hands more than
they could earn for me. The arbitrary jumps
in wages year by year bore no relation to
efficiency or increased output on the part
of the employee. So I gave up the idea, and
a dozen young women are living idly at home
who would have been very glad of the wages
I was prepared to pay them, but which they
were not allowed to take. Whether the
work started or not was of little consequence
to me. I was not dependent on it.
The trouble arises from the formula estab-
lished by Judge Higgins that a certain
standard of wages must be paid under all
circumstances. The basis was a living for
a family of five, and thus industry was
saddled with payments to single men for
families that did not exist. But the worst
feature of all was that the wage had to be
paid indiscriminately to the loafer and the
industrious workman, to the highly compe-
tent man and the bonehead.
It is giving no confidence away to suggest
that in his later years Judge Higgins was
a_ sadly disillusioned man regarding the con-
ditions he honestly thought he could estab-
lish in Australia. On this the writer, as a
personal friend of the Judge, could say a
great deal, but shrinks from opening a page
in the life of a good man which may just
as. well remain closed. Remorseless econo-
mic law will always in the long run beat
the best-intentioned benevolence. Not for
very long can an individual—or a country—go
on paying twenty-five shillings for a pound’s
worth of work. Yet that is what Australia
has been foolishly aiming to do, and what
some of its fools even now are trying to
perpetuate.—Yours, Saxo.
The Almighty Dole
Dear B„ —As I was one of the 100 who
were cast up on the island (B. 24/6/’3l)
and was there for many years. I can give
you first-hand information about it.
The island was very fertile, and we found
life easy and pleasant. But one of the party,
could not be contented with such soft condi-
tions. Ho climbed the mountains, and pushed
out, and found some cattle. Every week-
end he returned driving a young bull for
us to have a little meat. We so enjoyed
the change of diet that we were quite willing
to supply him with food and clothing that
he might spend another week looking for
another bull.
We might have lived on for years in this
contented, easy manner ; but it was at last
discovered that this man had been for
months clearing, dam-sinking and fencing, and
that there was enough stock in his paddocks
to give us a bull or cow every day for several
months. When we wanted to drive away
several for a daily feed, he argued that, if
we ate them up at that rate, there would
soon be none left, but that, if he was left
alone, he would improve the grazing so
much that in a few years we might safely
have meat every day. The proposal was not
to our liking, but as he was the only one
who knew how to bring the cattle to the
settlement, we had to let him have his own
way; but from that on we disliked him so
much that we christened him Capitalist.
On account of this ill-feeling w T e had meet>-
ings to decide what we should do to pre-
serve our liberties, and later on we formed
a Parliament, It "was just like the Aus-
tralian Parliament —it appointed boards to
deal with every phase of life, until a large
part of the population was employed on
boards and commissions and such things.
Next we started unions, and as each union
had a paid secretary, the non-producers
became nearly half the population. The
secretaries soon found that they had to do
something to earn their pay, so they pro-
moted strikes and basher gangs. This led
to the appointment of police. Thus non-
producers kept on increasing until there
were hardly any producers left. It was
found necessary to export a lot of food to
pay for the things we formerly made our-
selves; but the unions and politicians put up
wages and shortened hours of work to such
all extent that the producer found himself
in debt, so gave up exporting.
About this time 50 more men were cast
up on the island. There were no vacancies
for politicians, union secretaries, board
members, police or dole inspectors. Yet the
new arrivals did not want to live on the
dole; they therefore offered to produce some
of the things we were importing. But they
were not allowed under the law to work
more than 44 hours per week, and the
unions told them they were to go slow or
be declared black; and as what they could
produce under such conditions would leave
them no better off than if they produced
nothing and lived on the dole, they decided
to live on the dole.
And that's the present state of things in
our island. —Yours faithfully, F. L. M,
How Britain Might Help
Dear Bulletin, — Our overseas debt to
Britain might be reduced this way. (1) The
Federal Government to approach the Brit-
ish Government to make interest on Aus-
tralian loans tax-free. (2) We offer our
loans for conversion then at, say, 3 p.c. The
rich men in England would show a better
return for their investment at a tax-free
3 per cent, than they do now at 5 p.c. carry-
ing tax. (3) We give an overpowering
British preference on cotton goods and
motors and petrol. Australia with cheap
petrol and motoi's free of import duty would
quickly shake this depression off. Our great-
est problem is transport. Our taxation of
transport cuts its own throat.—Yours,
Scotia.

The New Guard Ups
At the top of the Town Hall stairs stands
a policeman, large and forbidding. You, a
mere worm, an outsider, a castaway, a noth-
ing, a blank—you go up the sandstone steps
insignificant and timorous. The policeman
takes no action. With a swipe he could have
knocked you into the middle of George-street.
You feel your height returning; pass on. You
arrive at the portals.
They, and the vestibule beyond, are
crowded. Witli men? No. With eyes. They
are gimlets, augers, stilettos, bayonets. One
pair of them stabs through the piece of green
pasteboard you have mechanically drawn
from your pocket. Eight voices say “Bight.”
You go on through an avenue of eyes. Fifty
pair of them gimlet the pasteboard, and it
remains intact. A ticket of admission, it has
become a miracle. Fifty more pair of eyes
dart at it without damaging its legend:—
Loyalist Be-union of
Members “New Guard.”
Consider these Dismounted Outriders and
those of Mr. Stuart Doyle. His are set up
at the portals of his various scrumptious,
superb, super-splendiferous addresses to
hypnotise people into coming in. There is
the irresistible lure of their gentle eyes,
large, melting and fluttered with lashes. Mr.
Doyle has thought so well of their power
of alluring as to aid and abet it by decking
t hem out in a uniform calculated to make
any normally inquisitive person hunger to
learn what possibly could be beyond such a
parade of highly-colored poppycock. But
here they are more vigorous than elegant,
more determined than solicitous. One slip,
one tremor and you feel that you would be
enjoying the heavens from the flat of your
back.. The job of these Outriders is not to
allure in, but to keep out
But at last you are inside. You can look
round on a sea of drab worsted and pink
flesh. It is quarter to eight; the show is
billed to start at eight, and already the
hall and the balconies are crowded. It is not
a prosperous-looking crowd. Women are in
the minority—four in 2500. They only accen-

in, but to keep out.”
tuate its colorlessness. Mostly it has worn
overcoats, and it kept them on. Its appear-
ance, compared with the usual audience at
this address, seems to suggest that the coats
are there to cloak a tendency towards seat-
out-of-the-pants. The frugality of the sar-
torial display, spreads everywhere. The con-
cert platform, where of late a. great yachts-
man fiddled in, lonely majesty, is a forest of
fiddles, but the space in the centre has the
air of a rostrum where presently an auc-
tioneer may start a sale of our unredeemed
pledges.
All this is illusion, simply engendered by
an absence of colored skirt. As soon as the
performers begin to perform it emerges that
the pasteboard was right—this is a re-union,
or, at any rate, a gathering, of the New
Guard. The fiddlers fiddle and the talkers
talk. The crowd throws off its look of blobs
of pink pastry on a foundation of black
dough. The metaphor is good. The per-
formance acts like yeast. The performers
cannot get along for the rising applause. One
calls the crowd a “gathering of hard-headed
men.” Applause, quick and dignified, signi-
fies that a compliment has been given and
taken. The Crown is mentioned time and
again, and nobody is frivolous enough to
advance the counter claims of the Anchor.
One speaker stands in front of a music
tripod and after trying vainly for half an hour
to throw his hands avyay, gives the trick
best arid ,si.ts( down. The applause shakes
the organ-pipes. - Another • exhorts members
of the audiepce to* “be masters- in their own
homes,” arid only the four'women are mute
in the tumult. Yet another refers to Mr.
Lang as “the ugly child of our sloth and
stupidity, treating this great community as
a drunken bottle-o treats his>horse.” It is
the gag of the evening. Applause? Some-
one will have to invent a better word.
All this is good; but there is a still stronger
evidence,' that at last the perfect audience
lias arrived. Between acts it entertains
itself! It sings “Advance Australia Fair,”
“God Save,” .“D .God,,, Our.; Help in Ages
Past” and. .“For, He’s a Jolly Good Fellow.”
Not being of the singing persuasion, you bow
a shamed head over your sheet of song paper,
and discover the cloven hoof at work. All
about you there are voices sincerely, seri-
ously, loudly, singing one version of the
song, and yet, before your eyes, your own
song paper distinctly reads : —■
His Ex., our help in crises past.
Our need in more, alack.
Our shelter from the windy blast
Of our infernal Jack,
And again the evil finger writes: —
Australia’s duns, let us remark
That we are on a spree;
We have no oof, our word is spoof,
Our future’s up a tree;
Our land resounds with noisome shifts
Of windbags raw and rash;
For love of Mike, let every ike
Advance, Australia, Cash!
Out, Evil One! this is a serious occasion.

Bang!!
Good God! What’s that?
Calm yourself, child! It is a motor-car

*■ The Firm has turned its tried friend
musicomedy out of Sydney Majesty’s for a
spell, and is filling the stage with the farce
“A Warm Corner” and the walls with Gilbert
and Sullivan announcements. The first-night
results were a fair number of vacant seats in
the d.-c., but the filled ones woke the place
with uproar. Nothing at the address for a
very long time has produced such continuous
laughter.
The piece is a string of, lines like “One
never forgets one’s first barmaid,” and it has
more plausible circumstances than most
things of the kind. It opens in a hotel on the
Lido, where a corn-plaster king named Corner
masquerades under the name of Pickles in
trying to sow a little grass-widow seed, out
of which he gets nothing but the honor of
paying the hotel and other bills of a need-
ful couple. Fairly naturally all those asso-
ciated with the affair are brought together
again in Corner’s English castle,, the farce
arising from liis meeting of one after another
of them and not being able to show any of
them the door for fear of his heavier half
getting wind of the holiday fiasco.
The malaprop wife, played by Bosie la
Varde, ,is . a concession to Frank Neilish
palates, but most of the rest of the fun is at
least above vulgarity and some of it sparkles.
Cecil Kellaway does his usual polished
piece of work as the corn-plaster! king, and
Campbell Copelin makes a good job of the
male side of the needful couple. This Show-
man has been watching Copelin for several
years now and has not yet seen him make
a bad job of anything. He has a distinct per-
sonality and voice, but no irritating manner-
isms ; an actor who can be seen frequently
without palling. Coral Brown, who imperson-
ates the needful young dame, is a comparative
newcomer who appears to have her limits.
Watching her acting with Frank Harvey
present writer thought her a little hard, an
opinion held only tentatively because the
parts were not light. Her latest part seems
to clinch it. Her personality is as hard
here as if was as the wife in “The Calendar,”
though the latter was supposed to be a sharp
and scheming adulteress and the present lady
is supposed to be a jolly bright spark with
nothing to her that an audience would call a
vice. Miss Brown was doing much better work
in “Aly Lady’s Dress,” in which she was
replaced to set her free for the farce role.
She is a . very neat-looking lady, apparently
doomed by nature to be a stage villainess. At
any rate, she has no sense of farce. Kella-
way has it in large numbers; so have Leslie
Holland, George Blunt and Alathea Siddons,
the last-named additionally possessed of a
very pleasant voice arid a not so pleasant
tendency to elocute. Elma Gibbs and E.
Pirie Bush are two other filches from the
“My Lady’s Dress” cast, and both dodge
along without running foul of critical brick-
bats or bouquets.

held forth at
the Con. Hall
on Saturday
evening, con-
ducted by Carl
Sauer. Star
item was a
performance of
Schumann’s D
minor S y 111-
phony, good
in parts. This
was preceded
by Mr. Sauer’s
o r ehestration
of three well-
known Schu-
ma n n piano
p i e c e S’ —
“Nachtstuck,”
“E r innerung”
and “Nordis-
ch e s Lied,”
scored in a
manner that
might have
won applause from the genial Bobert
had he been alive to pass judgment.
A couple of Chopin preludes—Nos. 7
and 20 of Op. 28—were also orches-
trated, not quite so successfully. Mr.
Sauex*’s own “Bussian Alelody” and “Tyro-
lean Shepherd’s Song” were applauded.
Stanley Clarkson, who has a fine resonant
voice, sang, with orchestral accompaniment,
Mendelssohn’s “O God Have Mercy” and
O’Hara’s “There Is No Death.” A choir
sang, among; other things, Mr. Sauer’s
arrangement of Beethoven’s “Creation’s
Hymn,” which sounded very impressive. Mr.
Sauer had a finger in the pie of 11 out of the
1(> items on the-programme, and though this
Showman has no quarrel with his work as
an arranger and (adaptor, or even, as a com-
poser, it may be gently suggested that he
has now amply proved his proficiency in
those departments.
“My Lady’s Dress” continues to get some
of the patronage Frank Harvey’s brilliant
acting deserves. The fine show has moved
to the Criterion, leaving Sydney Boyal ready
for the Tivoli Celebrity Vaudeville outbreak.
The St. James show seems to point that
the new vaudeville might pay dividends.
Following on a poor revue the tip-top
vaudeville bill there includes Fred’s foot-
balling hounds, Janette Gilmore, Fred
Bluett (who wears amazingly well) and a
dozen or more other quite passable turns.

At Sydney Opera House Frank Neil ’is
airing the farces that have made his name
a household word in Melbourne, Adelaide,
South Africa arid other remote parts of the
earth. He is following the Nat Phillips
precedent of a new show a week, shrewdly
roping in the Opera House regulars, who, ’
at- two bob and one, are the most consistent
patrons!’about Sydney. The current offer-
ing is “Mary’s Other Husband,” and the;
regulars ‘seem to like it. Neil is now seriously
threatening to turn to musical comedy.
•/ *
Another of Adelaide’s home-grown musical
comedies has kept the Boyal busy for a whole
week. The story of “Dutini,” by Edith Aird,
is unusually strong. A wilful English girl
demands from'her soldier lover the ruby eye
of a temple god. A native girl who has
hopelessly warned them against the mad
scheme interposes to save him, and herself
goes to the “sacred crocodiles” while he
goes back to happiness. Thelma Baulder-
stohe was effective in this scene; she
also “produced” the piece. Marcello
Berardi brought a fine Paris-trained soprano
to the other heroine’s part. The humor,
is mainly of a monkey-gland rejuvena- ■
lion, and Frank Part scored as actor and
“Exhorts members of the audience to ‘be
masters in their own homes.’”
later as acrobatic dancer. Tom King and'
Jack Fewster shared the whole tuneful side
of the show, and inspired some capital ballet
work ! “created” by Lesley Bowman. This
side of it is all ready for the professional
stage, where “Dutini,” written up a bit,
should be a success.
* * *
Brisbane Bepertory Society’s performance
of the Queensland play “In Beauty It Is
Finished,” by George Landen Dann, deserves,
credit, though why all the cast had to use
their best near-English speech in a play set
on the coast of Queensland, with a cast of
lighthouse-keepers, half-castes and harlots, is
one of those mysteries which only an amateur
producer understands. The W. E. A. Dram-
atic Club performed four one-act plays a
few days before the Bepertory production.
This is a. comparatively new society, and
its aim is “the establishment of a little
theatre in Brisbane.”
* * *
The Firm may .be regretting that the hold-
ing of a Gilbert and Sullivan matinee mainly
for children was not an earlier-in-tke-season
brain-wave! The first has been a huge suc-
cess. “Pinafore” and “Cox and Box” drew
a house-full audience of all ages, from kin-
dergarteners upwards. Ivan Menzies revealed
a flair for entertaining youngsters. He
chatted to them of. G. and S. works, and
led them in community singing of the catchy
choruses. Inviting any of the gathered to
come on to the stage and warble a bit alone,
he had the pleasure of seeing and hearing
himself mimicked in- the role of Sir Joseph
Porter by a clever eight-year-old, Betty Whit-
worth ; while Bill Tetley, a 14-year-old,
gave the Lord High Chancellor’s song. There
is to be another “Pinafore”-“Cox and Box”
matinee on August 1 at the Comedy for
the kiddies, with prizes to stir the young
talent.
¥ * *
Dorothy Gill made her farewell appearance
in Melbourne as Lady Jane in “Patience.”
She was compelling,. with , a dash of bright-
ness, and vocally excellent. Her “Sad Is that
Woman’s Lot”, was acclaimed with double
encore, and her duet with Ivan Menzies, “Go
to Him and Say to Him,” was the hit of the
first night of the piece, which on August . 5
will close the successful Gilbert and Sullivan
season. Miss Gill, who is now on her way
back to England, has left her successor,
Evelyn Gardiner, a high standard to main-
tain.
“Patience,” one of the best of the offerings,
permitted Ivan Menzies, as Bunthorne, to
add" another' to the clever studies he has
given, and Gregory Stroud, as Archibald, did
some capital singing and acting. Marie
Bremner, Bernard Manning, Grace Crotty,
Phil Smith and Leo Darnton are others well
in the picture. To-morrow (Thursday) the
company goes to the Comedy for the last
six nights of the season.

years ago that as long as she; lived she-, would

this hanging on to youth that robbed the

would have enhanced her talents. But “Why
should I?” cried Nellie Stewart, and so the
theatre never saw her in parts that ; many
claim would have revealed her as ideally great.
“Jacky Boo” (Lond.) : Harry Tighe.’s new
play, “Bush : Fire,,” has just been produced
in London, but critics are lukewarm. With
nothing Australian about it except the sor-
ting, it is a morbid domestic tangle in which
a city woman , spends six months in the bush
in an effort to. win back the husband she
deserted ten years before. He, meantime,
has acquired a mistress who has borne him
children. At the end of four acts the faith-
ful mistress keeps her; man. Alary Hinton
(Mrs. George Pitt Bivers) plays a leading
part. i : '

ABORIGINALITIES
“N.A.L.”: “Ther most experienced bloke
in minin’ I ever see,” remarked Boozy Bill,
“was old George Simpson, a mate of mine.
Seventy-two he was, and he’d bin at it
since he was ten. We was fossickin’ at
Talwal two years ago when old George got
crook. I see he was pretty bad, so I puts
him on the train at Nowra and sends him
down to Sydney. Ther quacks decides ter
operate, and they takes two rocks outer his
kidneys. Seven pound each they weighed.
In erbout a month old George comes back
and brings the stones with him. They was
kickin’ about the' hut fer weeks, till 7 one
wet day George takes one and dollies it fer
fun, just ter keep his hand in. Twelve
ounces of clean gold he gets, and ten ounces
outer the other one. Yer see he’d bin
swallerin’ gold dust all his life, an’ it settled
in his kidney. We was just goin’ ter peg
old George out as a claim when he pegged
out himself a fortnight later. Gold-poisonin’
ther quack said it was.”

“Hamer" : “Look out fer the dottle.” said
the man in the green hat. Then he swung
himself around the telegraph pole until he had
gained a velocity that took him off his feet,
when he released his hold and shot in a
graceful curve to the other side of the river.
Finding myself unable to escape by the same
means, I climbed the pole and ran along the'
telegraph wires. It was hazardous going;
sometimes I slipped off and only just saved
myself by grasping the wire and pulling my-
self up again. Then an enormous do-do
parrot swooped and I slid down another
post just in time. “The dottle is not far,”
said the parrot, so I shot down a rabbit
burrow and came out on another road, where
a man who was driving in a buggy with his
mother-in-law. his wife, his wife’s grand-
parents and 10 or 14 of the family (the
buggy, it should be noted, being drawn tan-
dem by a pig and a Cochin China rooster),
said: “Look out for the dottle ; it’s coming
along the road.” I ran 15 miles over rough
country, thoroughly scared by this time; then
I asked a man who was hanging head-down
from a pub sign what the ■ dottle was.
lie said. “What?” And when I asked him
what sort of what, he said, “Just what. It’s
coming now.” So I climbed up the front of
the hotel, ran over the roof and down the
other side, and asked a man who was
grooming an elephant with seven trunks what
the dottle was. He said: “Hell!” I ran
a thousand miles with the cobwebs catching
-my boots and found myself caught in one of
the traps outside the burrow. It was easier
to die, but I wanted to get a dictionary to
find out what a dottle was. and I remembered
in time that there were probably no dic-
tionaries in the place where I was likely to
go, unless they were printed on asbestos.
The first thing I asked the doctor, when
I came to, was “What is a dottle?” He
said, “Lie quiet, son; you’re all right, now.”
This is the queer thing: I told a friend about
the queer hallucinations that came under an
anaesthetic, and he said that in the part of
England he hailed from a giant toad was
known as a dottle. It is not in a dictionary,
and what I want to know is why a word
which I never remember meeting either in
print or out of it (except to describe the
tobacco left in a smoked pipe) should have
come to me like that in an ether dream?
Does anyone know what a dottle is, exactly ?
* * * *
“Mundowie”: There are several birds in
scrub and forest which seem to mock the
plodding swagman, particularly, so it seems
to him, when he is down on his luck; and
FAATHER KNOWS HIS WAY ’BOUT.
“I bin an bought ’ee present, mawther—little affair for savin’ gas.”
"Foolin’ away money again! I doan’t s’poase it’ll save a penn’orth o’ gas.”
“Iss, ’twill, mawther; it do be ’lectric kettle.”
I have heard a sour-grained old battler make
angry answers, as though he would have
liked to wring the little mocker’s neck. The
miner, the watchbird of the bush, rudely
shouts "Get work! Get work!” The gill
bird, which Binghi named guruwuk, cries
"Got to walk!” varied at times with
“Humpin’ your swag?” (Gould’s version of
this call is “Up with the rag.”) The dragoon
bird taunts the pedestrian by emphatically
calling “Walk to work!” The tallarook
inquires “Did you walk it?” But they
aren’t all cheeky. The yellow-throated friar
bird emits a pleasant “Hope you’re well?”
and the worn poo pigeon sends a man off with
“Good luck to you!”
“Homfrey Beale” : A full-blooded black gin
who died recently somewhere up north
deserves a line or two in The Bul-
letin. Her name was Mary Alice
Throgmorton—or so she said—and
in my youthful days she was a slavey
at a hotel near Walgett (N.S.W.).
Long contact with whites and the
kindly interest of a schoolmaster in
her young days had taught her to
read, and given her a quite respect-
able vocabulary. She had an in-
herent love of verse; the w r ork of
most of the Australian bards she
knew well, and she frequently enter-
tained a bar-full of shearers with
her recitations. Someone had once
given her the works of Keats and
Shelley, and she could reel off slabs
of each. She even attempted verse
herself, and most of her productions
in that line were no worse than many that
exacerbate city editors.
“Centurion”: Tell “Koolonga” ’(B.
15/7/’3l) that the grin he refers to refuses
to fade. Writer, having ridden horses
through two wars totalling over five years
of active service, has his own opinions as
to the type best suited for a cavalry
mount; as said before, it is the horse
of thoroughbred blood all the time, and
the purer the better. In the Great War
most of the Australian horses were of
thoroughbred strain. So were many of the
later Yeomanry remounts and all the horses
of the Indian cavalry. The biggest failures
in Chauvel’s campaign were the type “K ”
eulogises, “the heavy hunter type or weight-
carriers with a dash of trotting or pacing
blood in them.” The Yeos were at
first horsed with hackneys, but most of them
were riding Australian blood horses at the
finish. Read “The Official History of the
War” dealing with Sinai-Palestine, p. 39:
“The lesson of the war was that, provided
a horse had bone and substance and was
not too eager and fretful, the closer it was
to thoroughbred racing strain the more valu-
able it was for active service.” Finally, the
active-service weight of the active-service
cavalryman is about 14 stone —not 20. Even
a tin-ribbed Lifeguardsman in all his splen-
dor for parade hardly pulls that down.
❖ * * *
“T.H.F.”: There are still many gainful
occupations open to those whose top-piece is
screwed on at the right angle. Lately I met
a sturdy hustler who informed me he was
making good money out of the collection of
old cedar. Many of the pioneers on the
North Coast of N.S.W. used cedar exten-
sively for fencing. My acquaintance con-
tracted to replace the old fences with new
timber, taking the old posts and panels in
payment. It seems there is a good demand
in Sydney for cedar and other nicely-figured
timbers for veneers. As some of Australia’s
most beautiful woods were hacked into posts
and rails in the early days, the field for
salvage may be extensive.
* * * *
“Bangtail”: Canada,, desiring recently to
count the carefully-preserved buffalo herds
which are almost the only survivors of; the
millions which roamed the American and
Canadian prairies 70 years or so ago, has
hit on a novel means of carrying out what
has hitherto been a difficult job. ’Planes
from the Royal Canadian Air Force patrolled
over the buffalo reserves, and by this
means isolated little lots which might other-
wise have been missed were located and
counted 'with the larger herds. The plan
would save a lot of trouble on the big
cattle stations of western Queensland when
a general muster on such occasions as the
sale of the run is necessary. At present, if
the buyer is unwilling to take the book
figures—and that is a risky thing to do at
the best of times —there is nothing for it
but the tedious “bangtail” count through
the races. That takes time and money,
whereas a ’plane count would amount to less
than a day’s comfortable occupation coupled
with the absolute assurance to the buyer
that he has got every beast he is being asked
to pay for.

his sanity. Out at sea, sailing on a calm

the largest Dunedin building, glittering pink

“Bad Australian”:
References to the
“song” of the lyre-
bird must have led to
disappointment among
people who had never
heard the bird and
were looking forward
to a burst of melody
when he was put on
the air. His natural
note is no more melo-
dious than that of the
mopoke. Apart from
a queer hissing squeak
when alarmed, and the
monotonous “Plirk-
pli r k, plirk-plirk-
plirk” with which he
greets early morn and
dewy eve, and, occa-
sionally, moonlit night,
ho has nothing origi-
nal to put on record.
What he lacks in
melody he makes up
in mimicry of other
birds and almost any
strange sound that
comes within his
somewhat circu in-
scribed sphere of
observation. He is
perfect in liis imita-
tion of the ear-splitting-
screech of the white
and the harsh cry of
the black cockatoo,
the mournful call of
the wonga, the grat-
ing noise of the gang-
gan g, the strident
squawk of the grey
magpie, the short,
sharp snap of the
whipbird, and the
chatter of various
kinds of parrots. The
lyrebird’s copy of a
suddenly-startled flock
of lories is an amaz-
ing performance. But
there is something in
the raucous hilarity

which eludes him, and his imitation of that
deceitfully sedate-looking bird is far from
convincing,

failed to notice my
presence, although I
moved a few yards
nearer and sat down
to see the perform-
ance out. On an-
other occasion I saw
a fox carrying a hen
through a scattered
white-gum forest. I
quietly followed him
till he dropped out
of sight in a shallow
excavation from
which gravel had
been removed. I got
to within 20 feet of
him and watched
him bury the hen

as a cocoanut which I flung at his _ head
struck a log about an inch above the tips of
his ears.

Driven into the Cold Snow
by a Harsh Father
If it isn’t a harsh parent who’s doing the driving, and if the cold snow is
falling on the heights of MT. BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK—well, there’s
more cause for exhilaration than despair in such an experience.
Still, on reflection, no one ever needs to be driven into the snow at Buffalo,
while the harshest and most brutal father would soon be mellowed into a
gently tolerant frame of mind by the invigorating joys of skating, ski-ing,
falling off toboggans, sculpting Epstein-like snow-men and hurling snowballs
at unsuspecting guests.
A big reduction in the winter tariff: at The Chalet has brought the cost of a
week’s holiday at Mt. Buffalo (Vic.), between July 24 and August 20, DOWN TO

during the Christmas fortnight. For the rest of the year The Chalet tariff is
only 15/- per day (day visitors slightly higher). Full information and booking

But there was no hope in Bill’s bloodshot,

A DISAPPOINTING SHOW.
The Dramatic Critic Visits Parliament.
The vaudeville entertainment at The
Assembly in Maequarie-street is of the kind
known to our fathers as “Blackface.” Any-
how, most of the performers wear black
expressions, get black in the face with rage,
or acquire black eyes; and there are corner-
men. .Tacky Lang and Tommy Bavin fill
the latter roles. The stars furnish a divert-
ing contrast —.Jacky large and truculent,
Tommy small and defiant; Jacky a bur-
lesque working man, Tommy an imitation
dude.; and so on. Their comedy is Attic in
its simplicity. Tacky perpetrates ail asinine
blunder, which is applauded uproariously
by those in his corner, and Tommy at once
makes a song about it, to the simulated
delight of those in his corner. And so it
goes on, with all the interminable and futile
verbosity of a Chinese drama.
There are neither stalls nor dress-circle
seats at The Assembly-—only a gallery. An
odd convention prevails with regard to the
gallery. A spectator who applauds, say.
.Tacky is at once thrown out at the instance
of one of Tommy’s men ; while one who gives
.Tacky a well-earned “bird” is evicted by
direction of someone in the victim’s corner.
A ehucker-out in the person of an armed
sergeant is kept by the management for the
purpose. The contention of the directors,
Messrs. Tradesorl and Nat. Klubb, who
boast that this is the most ruinously extra-
vagant show of its kind on earth, is that no
one must be allowed to compete with the
east, vdiich has been pre-selected by them
for its virtuosity in noisy abusiveness,
An Empire Duet was rendered by “Fog-
horn” Weaver and “Alphabet” Reid (“The
North Shore Screams”) on the night the
writer attended. The item was inspiriting,
if overloud, and was delivered with aplomb
—not to be wondered at seeing that the
artists have been featuring it for the past
20 years. “The Doc’s” lecture, “Let’s Drink
Milk," was made all the quainter by the fact
that more than one member of the company
had obviously been absorbing a beverage
much more cheering than miik.
This entertainment, which provides neither
pleasure nor profit except to those associated
with it, has been running since the end of
last year, and may last over two years more
unless disgusted and scandalised audiences
do something about it.

SHADOW SHOWS.
Paramount’s “Tarnished Lady,” at Sydney
State, introduces Tallulah Bankhead _ as our
tiresome old friend the Modern Girl the
only posturer on earth who habitually roy-
sters with sneers in her eyes. She screens
well, looking as a Rossetti damosel might look
if she had" had her eyebrows plucked and
been on several heavy binges, and her lovely
American voice is adequately reproduced.
When the play begins she and her society
mother are hard up, and Clive Brook, mil-
lionaire New York broker, wants to marry
her. But she has a neurotic infatuation for
another. So she accepts Brook, while her
face registers loathing, spends a dejected
night with his rival, continues to register
loathing after marriage, and just after he
goes bankrupt, but before she hears of it.
tells him she “can’t stand it any more,” and
leaves him. Yes, perceptive reader, you have
guessed right! She gets work, has a baby,
discovers she loves him, and they are re-
united. The trite plot is a good medium for
Miss Bankhead’s methods. She only laughs
once—when she is getting drunk with a party
of slum-dwellers and her heart is Breaking.
The rest of the time she wanders lugubriously
about regretting the past, despairing of the
future and luxuriating in the distress of her
friends. She has Greta Garbo’s gift for
expressing fatigued depravity, and the Garbo
trick of understating emotions. Her figure is
as good as Garbo’s, her voice is incomparably
better, and she is obviously sophisticated—
so much so that one can imagine her shriek-
ing with laughter as she made this sloppy pic-
ture. Clive Brook has a poor part, and is
more wooden than usual, and the other per-
formers don’t call for enthusiastic mention
either.
V
M.-G.-M.’s “Daybreak,” at Sydney Regent,
features Ramon Novarro as a pre-war Aus-
trian guards officer. In his unit those who
couldn’t pay their debts of honor were sup-
posed to suicide. He prefers to expiate
his J. T. Lang-like conduct by donning civ-
vies, and clasping Helen Chandler to his
bosom. Before doing so he remarks, “This
is my birthday,” and, during the luscious
kiss which follows, “The End” flashes up.
He has presumably entered on the daybreak
of a new life. As an attempt to exploit
Novarro’s sex-appeal, this picture fails. Like
so many of his nation’s charmers, he has
put on too much weight for his height. In
consequence his brother-officers have to be
•short and stout too. Their obesity is a de-
parture from the military tradition of the
country and period, and it is emphasised,
in Novarro’s case, by a close-cropped head
which is alien to his Mediterranean type.
In short, the play is badly cast. There are
many smart lines and some admirable scenes
of revelry. Jean Ilersliolt, Aubrey Smith (as
a general), Clara Blandwick and a cigar-
smoking night-club queen whose name doesn’t
appear on the programme help to uplift
the production.
Also at the Regent are Fox’s “Three Girls
Lost” (viz., Loretta Young, Joyce Compton
and Joan Marsh). It is the kind of enter-
tainment that Hollywood does best, and it
would probably have been better if our cen-
sor had left it alone. Frivolous Joan falls
in with Lew Cody, a hi-jaeker destined to
be shot by rival gangsters. Joyce picks up
with a gentleman whom she guesses to be
in the cattle business because he “complains
of having constant trouble with the bulls.”
Loretta holds herself aloof in memory of
a lad in her home town —“a bozo in a bank”
who loves her, but whom she doesn’t love.
John Wayne rooms with the three, and it
becomes manifest that a first and only love
is burgeoning for him in Loretta’s heart.
The fact is hammered home by close-ups in
which the director has employed every imag-
inable form of sigh and gesture known to
stage Luv. The photography is excellent:
there is a trip in an aeroplane that could
hardly be bettered. The gangsters who
arrange Cody’s murder are unexceptionable;
so are the ’tec who arrests the blameless
Wayne for the crime, the landlady of the
rooming-house, and the gentlemen of the
Chicago press who come after the inside
stahry.
* * *
In “Kiki,” at Sydney Capitol, Mary Pick-
ford proves that she is still as active as
her athlete-husband. When the writer stole
away to avoid the crush on Friday night
she was turning catherine-wheels on the
floor of Reginald Denny’s flat with incredible
rapidity. The foregoing proceedings had
been on similar lines. -The Grand Old Girl
of Hollywood is a conventionally volatile
French chorine, with Denny as her
manager. H'er efforts to steal him from
the star of the show, to whom he is mar-
ried, constitute the comedy. Few actresses
could give Miss Pickford points as regards
energy, but she is too old for the part. Her
celebrated curls begin to assume that wig-
like effect, and her figure, of which she shows
a lot, is no longer childish. The time has
come for her to fade out as the World’s
Sweetheart and reappear as the World’s
Grandmother, a r6le in which her pretty
little face and wistful smile should be assets.
Reginald Denny has some of the tricks of
voice and eyebrow of the old-time beauty
actor, and they are accentuated by the invi-
dious part he has to play. He is only a
feeder to Miss Pickford, and evidently feel !
it. All the subsidiaries are good.
“East Is West,” which precedes “Kiki. ’
poses what some might consider an awk-
ward problem:—•
Can Ming Toy rise from the shame of a Chinese
love boat to the heights of an inspired love, and
sweep aside the man-made barriers of color, caste
and creed?
Lupe Velez (Ming) does it on her head.
Lew Ayres inspires and returns her love,
and instals her in his American home, where
she slides down banisters, burlesques the
butler, and is winsome and temperamental
in various other directions. If you haven’t
the writer’s complex regarding Miss Velez,
which takes the form of an unmanly longing
to drown her. then by all means see “East
Is West.” Many of the sets are beautiful,
and it has some original and interesting fade
effects.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
THE LUCERNE FLEA.
"Yeoman”: Lucerne-growers should make
an examination of their stands for the
presence of the destructive lucerne flea. It
feeds on the chlorophyll, stems and leaves
becoming colorless, stunted and valueless.
The flea is most active during the spring
months, and if infestation is at. all bad two
out of the first three cuts will be lost, or, if
the growth is grazed, 75 per cent, of its
feeding value will disappear. In very bad
cases the stand may be ruined.
The late W. Heithersay, of Fullarton
(S.A.), demonstrated that the lucerne flea
could be controlled, if not eradicated, at a
reasonable cost. With the assistance of E.
Irloile, a well-known chemist, he compounded
a spray which proved most, effective in
destroying the symnthurides. The compound
is made up and sold in Adelaide at what
separate ingredients would cost buyers; in
effect, Mr. Heithersay gave his formula for
the benefit of lucerne-growers.
His method of application was to spray
the lucerne plot in August; if necessary, a
second and weaker spraying would be given
three to five weeks later. Whether the
growth should be grazed or cut before the
initial spraying depended upon height and
thickness of the plants and degree of infes-
tation. The Heithersay trials were carried
out under the supervision of Geo. Quinn,
S.A. Director of Horticulture, and A. M.
Lea, State Entomologist, in fields of lucerne
which were practically ruined by the
flea. The compound burnt the infested
plants, but it also poisoned the flea,
and a strong growth, free from flea,
was soon made from the crowns. Mr.
Heithersay used a power spraying pump, the
solution being distributed in a foaming vapor
through jets on a trailing boom made for
the purpose by the experimentalist. Subse-
quently thousands of acres of flea-infested
lucerne on the Adelaide Plains were sprayed
under Mr. Ileithersay’s supervision, and the
flea, which was threatening the extinction of
lucerne in this area, was brought under
control. _ Mr. Heithersay also treated sub.
clover with equal success. His compound
lias an arsenical base, and is just as effec-
tive in controlling attacks of grubs, cater-
pillars and grasshoppers.
THE WEATHER.
“U. R. Dry”: Some of our best weather
prophets are to be found among the old-
timers on the land. Their methods are many
and varied, but are always accompanied by
what is termed “good weather sense.” In
some cases as much as 60 years’ experience
of the district climate is combined with a
methodical and keen power of observation to
produce most accurate tips.
A weather diary or card-index, together
with Fahrenheit thermometer and rain-gauge;
is of great value to the wheat-farmer, dairy-
man or grazier, and indispensable to a mixed
farmer like myself. How often do we look
at the sky when considering sowing peas m
midsummer, or, say, a few acres of autumn
rape for topping off a few sheep? Half an
inch of rain following sowing is usually
worth more than a couple of inches before
putting the summer or autumn crop iu. Keep-
ing the records may safely be left to the
womenfolk. Common weather signs, such
as salt becoming damp (due to an increase
in the amount of water in the atmosphere),
the behavior of the small ant at change
of seasons, the sudden advent of birds such
as* swifts, or even the viciousness of the old
dog with the lame leg, all have their mean-
ing to the farm weather prophet.
Old George Hunt was noted throughout
Gippsland in the days of my youth for his
wonderful success in diagnosing the weather.
The old man relied upon a small ball of
wool, which had been dipped in sympathetic
ink (a solution of cobalt chloride), dried and
hung on the back verandah. Whenever the
blue color faded from the wool the prophet
would immediately inspect the telephone-
wires, and from their humming would not
only accurately forecast the time of arrival
of the change but also the dowmpour in
ihches.
PREPARING RAMS FOR SALE.
“Liss” : A feature of the Sydney ram sales
each year is the comparatively poor condi-
tion and lack of preparation displayed by a
large proportion of the offerings. It costs
money to show a ram well groomed and in
good nick, and many studrnasters hold that
the prices obtained do not justify the out-
lay. They overlook the fact that the market
the.se' days is . easily saturated and that
buyers nowadays are a discriminating class.
Flockmasters with a fixed sum to lay out
on new sires prefer to pay more per head
for fewer sheep, provided they fill the eye.
It is a decidedly bad advertisement for a
stud if its representatives go in looking
anything but their best. The average
prices obtained are in all the papers and
those who were not present at the sales are
apt to attribute low prices to low quality.
On the other hand, sheep xvell got up excite
favorable comment from those on the spot,
and the good average obtained is noted by
distant readers. I say it is sound policy to
exhibit your goods' at their best.
Preparation should commence from two
to three months prior to the sales, according
to condition. Rams should be kept out
of all rain for at least two months and
rugged for the last two or three weeks, right
up to their arrival in store. When just
brought in they should be dosed for worms.
Feet should be trimmed, faces cleaned up
carefully with shears and stains removed
from crutches and the neighboring region.
They should be carefully trimmed all over
with sharp shears, and all these points must
be attended to from time to time.
As regards feeding, never give more at one
feed than the animals will clean up. In the
beginning the daily ration per head will be,
approximately, IMb. chaff, Jib. bran, jib.
crushed oats and jib. linseed meal. This
w’ill be split into two feeds, one early in
the morning and one in the evening. After
a week or so, discontinue the daily use of
linseed meal, giving it twice a week only.
While using it daily include all the meal
in one feed, and all the oats in the other.
As they come on to their feed increase the
chaff ration arid, if you like, the bran, too.
but not the oats; 4oz. per day is plenty for
housed sheep. Two or three times per week
give a small feed of lucerne hay at midday,
but don’t,overdo this, as it spoils the appear-
of the fleece.
Use nothing but the best of feed, keep
plenty of good water and salt lick in front
of them, and you will be proud of their
appearance in the pens.
SOME GOOD NATIVE GRASSES.
“Mulyan”; Two of the best are wallaby
grass and silver-top, both fairly tall and
rather show r y on account of the white tops
or seed heads. They grow nearly anywhere,
from the coast to the interior, bear abundant
crops of seed, and are easily propagated.
Their fattening qualities are shown by the
sleek cattle that arc usually found where one
or other is abundant. All kinds of stock are
fond of them. Both respond w r ell to cultiva-
tion and make capital hay, perhaps the next
best to Mitchell grass.
The seeds of these grasses belong to the
flying class: they have a light, fluffy cover-
ing by means of which they are easily carried
by the wind and distributed over the coun-
try. Thus, if a patch is sow 7 n here and there
and allow-ed to seed, they w’ill soon be spread
about the paddock. One of the prettiest
pastures I have seen was in New England;
it consisted mainly of silver-top and red-top
—a tall, scented grass, when in flower, and
good fodder.
Talking of w’allaby grass naturally sug-
gests kangaroo grass, though the two are
not related. It w 7 as this grass that charmed
the early pastoralists on the upper parts
of the Richmond River, and made those runs
famous for their beef-cattle. It. grows about
4ft. high, and paddocks of it when in .seed
resemble waving wheatfields. It does not
stand severe grazing like wallaby grass, and
is not so easy to propagate, but it makes
excellent fattening hay. Cut when in flower,
it tides a dairy herd over winter as well as
any cultivated crop.
Two other quick-fattening grasses which
grow in N.S.W. from coast to far interior
are hay brown-top or sugar grass and
blue grass. Both have triplicate seed
heads, but while blue grass has a bluish
tinge the other is conspicuous for its glossy-
brown top. Stock are so fond of the latter
that it is generally eaten right down to the
ground. On account of its deep, spreading
roots, it is one of the best to grow along
water-courses to prevent soil erosion. Blue
grass is the grass that drovers love to get
their mobs into and bush poets to sing about.
But it does well in coastal climes, and makes
a valuable addition to the pasturage.
Common to the black-soil plains is the
sweet and attractive coolah grass, or black-
fellows’ wheat. Black women used to gather
the seeds in coolamons, grind them with
stones and make the flour into damper. This
grass grows about 2ft. high, and is nutri-
tious in all its stages, from tender green
to dry. When in flower its brick-red top
gives it a striking appearance. It is a
long-lived grass, stands heavy grazing and
endures when other herbage in its locality
has disappeared.
Another good drought-resisting grass,
which is at home anywhere from the coast
to the central regions and which is highly
valued by stockowners, is the native oat, so
called from the resemblance of its compara-
tively large seeds to the cultivated oats.
It is a prolific grain-bearer, and was an-
other source of blackfellows’ flour. In .sea-
son the gins gathered bushels of this grain,
which is easily freed from its husk, and with
cultivation might be developed into a useful
commercial cereal. The grass is a tussocky
perennial, and one of the tallest of the indi-
genous sorts, growing from sft. to 9ft. high.
Stock of all kinds are fond of it, and w'ill
eat it to the ground.
TREATING WOUNDS IN STOCK.
“Jethro Tull”: First arrest the bleeding.
If the blood is from an artery, it will be
bright red and escaping in jets ; if from a
vein, it will be dark red, brightening on
exposure to the air, and flowing steadily
from the wound. Capillary blood oozes anil
is intermediate in color. When an artery
has been injured quick treatment is neces-
sary. Sometimes the end of the vessel may
be held with forceps and secured by tying
with silk or catgut. When this is not pos-
sible pressure may be obtained by tying a
pad or towel on the side nearest the heart.
Try applying a red-hot iron when the bleed-
ing is slight; and, bleeding stopped, remove
any foreign matter present, otherwise healing
is an impossibility. When an animal is
suffering from loss of blood intravenous
injections of a normal salt solution will give
almost immediate relief.
Bathing the wound is the next step. The
main principle in the use of antiseptic
washes is to check the growth of germs with
the minimum amount of injury to the tis-
sues. A teaspoon of salt to a pint of water
is a good cleansing agent and does not injure
the tissues.
A good dressing consists of one part tinc-
ture of iodine and 10 parts methylated spirit.
The alcohol is absorbed by the system and
the iodine covers the injured tissue in a
very fine film. When the wound gapes,
sewing is necessary. Use either silk thread
or catgut. In an emergency strong linen
thread or even common white twine may be
used, but any such material should be well
sterilised by boiling before using. Take the
stitches well back from the margin of the
wound to prevent tearing and do not draw
them too tight, otherwise subsequent swell-
ing may cause them to tear out. Each stitch
should be separate from the other, and allow
ample space for drainage.
Bandaging is only necessary where there
is risk of injury or dirt is likely to enter.
Many wounds, barb-wire cuts in particular,
heal better if left uncovered.
A FAIR DEAL FOR THE DOG.
“A. Collie”: With a great many other-
readers I am saying a little prayer for
"Back Swallow” (B. 15/7/’3l), whose con-
tribution is admirable. I have noted time
and again that the farm dog, which, as the
owner tells you, is the most valued worker
on the place (“Money couldn’t buy him,
sir!”), occupies the usual position under
the old pepper-tree near the stables, chained
to the saw 7 n-off hollow log which acts as
his kennel, and surrounded by the remnants
of many a feed and the flies attached thereto.
It is sheer thoughtlessness.
“Back Sw-allow” hands us out a lot of
useful knowledge and I crave leave to add
the necessity of attending to the animal’s
comfort. As clothes make the man, the
kennel often makes the dog. A tepid bath
occasionally in which a teacup of eucalyp-
tus oil emulsion or phenyle is added refreshes
Towser and keeps him clean. And keep the
environments of the kennel as clean as the
dog, so that he may not expend any more
of his energy or destroy any teeth in snap-
ping at or brushing away flies. Feed him
once daily and let it be tucker equal to that
partaken of by the family. Any wound
should be dressed with tincture of iodine at
once, and a drop per month given internally
will work wonders. For -the semblance of
a skin disease use lime-sulphur neat, and
above everything work him regularly. Many
a good dog has been crippled with the
sudden task of getting the sheep to the
market 20 miles away through being too
soft and fresh from a few weeks’ idleness.
TACKLING BLACK ORANGE APHIS.
The black orange aphis is a nuisance to
growers, particularly in Westralia. It is
often responsible for poor setting of fruit
and damage to the young.spring and early-
summer growth. As soon as the hot weather
sets in it almost disappears. It w-as sus-
pected by the Westralian entomologist, L. J.
Newman, that the aphis might live upon
the roots of the trees during hot
weather, and the possibility of other alter-
nate host plants was investigated, in eaeh
ease with negative results.
Mr. Newman now reports that the pres-
ence of the woolly-aphis parasite (Aphel-
inns mali) in the black orange aphis has
been definitely ascertained. The beneficial
parasite has also been found attacking an
undescribed species of aphis on a garden
plant (Aeclepias fruticosa ) in the Govern-
ment House garden, Perth. “This,” he says,
“may prove of as much value to citrus-
growers in the control of the black orange
aphis as ApheUnus mali is to the apple-
growers in controlling the woolly aphis. It
is possible that we have developed a strain
of ApheUnus from the'original introduction
of ApheUnus mali. Our intention is to fol-
low 7 this discovery up very carefully during
the coming season with the object of estab-
lishing this strain in the various citrus areas.
It will take time to do this work, but if it
can be accomplished the effort -will be well
worth while.”
THE DESPISED QUINCE,
“Disc Harrow ”: A small side-line worth
thinking about when planting an orchard is
quinces. It is no use planting them in
quantity, but for filling up odd corners too
wet for apples, or too awkward to get the
spray-pump into, they are just the thing.
They are also useful for planting as outside
rows in orchards, as they have a thick,
bushy growth and are helpful as windbreaks.
The main thing is to concentrate on good-
sized fruit, as small quinces are not w r orth
the trouble Of harvesting. The young tree is
shaped in the same manner as an apple or
pear, but thereafter should be pruned
severely, all dead wood being cut out and
the fruit-bearing wood w 7 ell thinned.
Even if the quinces are not wanted for
commercial purposes, they are always wel-
comed in the house. The chief point in their
favor is that they cost hardly anything;
They take no spray and no coddling, it
does not make much difference whether they
see a plough or not, and the little extra time
they require at pruning is not noticed.
FOOD STUDY IN AMERICA.
From an Australian who is doing a post-
graduate course in agriculture in the TJ.S.A.:
Probably the only physically perfect race in the
world to-day is to be found among the hill peoples
on the slopes of the Himalayas. W 7 hy? Because
these people have had the wisdom to avoid our
complex, sophisticated, denatured foods, decorti-
cated grains, etc. Colonel McCarrison, of the
Indian Medical Service, reported that he had found
no evidence of disease among these people during
the whole of his nine and a half years spent among
them when he was resident medical officer in the
State of Hanza.
Lieut.-Colonel Herbert Ilallilay, also of the 1.M.5.,
states that it is by no means unusual to find a
perfect set of teeth in the jaws of octogenarian men
and women in the Punjab. All these peoples con-
sume large quantities of fresh milk daily all their
lives. They live on a balanced diet, grown locally,
and therefore rich in the essential minerals, whole-
grain cakes or bread, leafy vegetables, fruits, milk,
cheese, fowls, eggs and occasionally a little goats’
flesh. The small wizened people of the Plains—the
Madrassi —live on polished (white devitalised) rice;
spices and condiments. It is now admitted that
vitamin I) is the “activator” of assimilation of
calcium and phosphorus in the human body. Vitamin
D, the “sunshine” vitamin, and calcium and phos-
phorus; are found in fresh milk, where the dairy cow
is exposed to sunlight. In fog-clothed and smoke;
cursed areas the dairy cow is not putting enough c-f
the “sunshine” vitamin D into her milk; hence
the great prevalence of rickets in large cities and
industrial centres, especially during the sunless
periods of the year. Children need not only foods
rich in vitamin D, but in vitamins A, B and C—all
more or less affected by time, temperature and
storage.
An inadequate supply of these vitamins in
the daily intake of children lowers their resistance
to infection, particularly colds and pneumonia. They
all play an important part in growth, and teeth and
bone development. Many medical men believe that a
generous use of vitamin A in early youth gives the
body a greater immunity to infection in later years.
This is an excellent argument for fresh foods and
a quart of fresh milk in the daily intake of all
children. Because vitamin potency is lowered in the
preparation of foods, it should be the invariable rule
for everybody to eat fresh fruits and vegetables, cooked
and uncooked, twice a day. Because of the fact that
whole milk contains vitamin A (the anti-ophthalmic
and anti-infective vitamin) a campaign is now 7 being
staged in favor of certified milk, because the potency
of vitamin A is lowered in the process of pasteurisa-
tion. This movement has called for the whole-hearted
co-operation of the Association of Medical Milk
Commissions in U.S. and Canada. There are nd
fewer than 80 branches in the United States, and
they are proving a great boon to the dairyman ami
the consumer alike. Canadians, however, are more
advanced in these matters than the people of the
U.S.A. ; they consume more fresh milk, butter and ice-
cream than their cousins germane over the border.
Canada, too, has led the way in the irradiation of
foodstuffs containing ergosterol; and many bakeries
in America to-day are producing irradiated bread,
which will be one of the most effective ways of
preventing and controlling rickets until irradiated
milk is better known. In Germany many municipali-
ties are arranging for the distribution of irradiated

FARM ACCOUNTS
The articles published on “The Bulletin s Land page have
been reprinted and added to.
In these lessons the farmer who did not previously know a
thing about book-keeping is carried along, step by step, and
shown how accounts are kept. Every entry is explained m the
simplest and clearest possible language.
The object is to enable the farmer to put his business on a
proper basis and keep it there.
In no other calling is it more necessary to follow every
branch of the business and see where a profit is being made
and where a loss.
Many a farmer has come to grief simply through not knowing
that he was going back a little furthe: every year. Had he
known in time he might have made changes that would have
saved the situation.
The trouble about most attempts to show the farmer how to
keep accounts is that they assume he knows something about
book-keeping.
“The Bulletin,” at the request of scores of farm readers,
decided to produce a cheap textbook in which the whole
business of book-keeping would be dealt with from the very
beginning.
The little book is published at a price which brings it within
the means of everybody. It will be sent from any “Bulletin
Office for sixpence, to which must be added 2d. for postage.
Though designed primarily for the man on the land, it will be
found just as valuable to traders and others who have hitherto
had only a foggy idea about accounts.

Watson is the pioneer in this field. The first attempts
to study the irradiation of the dairy cow were made
at the Lister Institute in Britain in 1924 and 1920.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) Is it possible to continue planting
crop after crop on the same land if you fer-
tilise regularly? (2) Have the big Aust.
tobacco firms purchased any Queensland-
grown tobacco-leaf this year? (3) Is it
likely that the present price offered for
Texas and Mareeba leaf will continue? (4)
Has the coastal air in Queensland any effect
on the tobacco plant while it is growing? —
4254.
(1) No. Rotation crops are necessary
whether you fertilise the land or not. (2)
It is understood a leading firm bought a
good parcel of Texas leaf. (3) Can’t say,
but there should he little or no difficulty in
securing a payable price for flue-cured leaf
of good quality if the tariff keeps up. (4)
Yes. Some authorities recommend that
tobacco should not be grown close to the sea.
Most suitable method of constructing barns
for flue-curing of tobacco —concrete or wood
and iron? —4253.
A timber framework lined inside and out
with galvanised iron, with the interspace
insulated, will make a suitable barn provided
other important structural details are pro-
vided for. Consult officers of the Agricul-
tural Department at Atherton (N.Q.). Con-
crete is.rather too absorbent unless the inside
face of the walls is protected with paint or
a suitable compound. In country where -white
ants are prevalent timber should be treated
beforehand with a suitable poison.
(1) Capital required to make a living at
tobacco-growing in Vie.? (2) How long from
time of starting work before a profit can be
expected? (3) Is the market satisfactory?
(4) Books or other literature to consult?■ —
4359.
(1) It shouldn’t be taken up without some
experience on a tobacco-farm as a laborer,
or on a share basis under the guidance of
an experienced grower. For share-farming
£lOO would be sufficient. (2) Seed is sown
in July and August. The crop is marketed
during the following July and August. (3)
Yes, for good class leaf. (4) Get Bulletin
53, 5d., from Agriculture Department, Mel-
bourne.
(1) Where to get Tangier peas for seed?
(2) Any good for ploughing in as green
manure? (3) Any good as table vegetable
or for feeding stock? —4407.
(1) A. T. O’Connell, Dwarda (W.A.).
(2) Yes; one of the best crops for the
purpose. (3) Too small for table. The foli-
age makes good stock fodder, containing 6.48
p.c. of protein as against 5.68 p.c. protein
contained in bean straw.
(1) Climate, soil and rainfall required
for the successful growing of the tung-tree?
(2) Where can seed be obtained? (3) What
is the yield of nuts per acre?* —4721.
(1) Ideal soil is slightly acid, sandy loam
with clay underlying at 3ft. to sft. down.
The tree flourishes in a warm climate with
moderately-heavy rainfall. Soil must be well
drained. (2) Possibly from the Govern-
ment experimental farm at Grafton
(N.S.W.), where these trees are cultivated.
(3) Planted in rows 30ft. apart and 12^ ft.
between trees, the yield per acre in Florida
has been 400 lb. to 18001 b. of oil from the
third to the ninth year. The trees live 25
to 30 years.
(1) Is the Mornington peninsula suitable
for the cultivation of olives? (2) Most suit-
able species for production of oil or bottled
olives? (3) What space between trees and
any special treatment required? (4) Approxi-
mate cost per 100? —4493.
(1) They could be grown there, but would
yield better crops in. warmer parts of Vic-
toria. (2) Among the most popular in
South Aus. are Verdaille or Verdale, Bou-
quettier and Gros Redoneau for oil. The
last named is also suitable for pickling. The
Seville Queen olive and the Manzilla, which
are excellent for pickling, arc little grown
in Australia. (3) Strong growers are
planted at the rate of about 48 to the acre;
more moderate growers up to 108 trees per
acre. (4) £6 to £ll per 100.
(1) Is Australian sweet corn the same
quality as American? (2) What is the
season? (3) Would it sweat or mould on
journey to Sydney? (4) Average price, and
any other information on subject available?
—4585.
(1) Yes; Australian maize-growing dis-
tricts are ideal for this product, especially
the, mid-eastern parts. (2) The same as for
ordinary maize. (3) It carries well, over
long distances, in husk, provided it is sent
away as soon as it is pulled. (4) Unfor-
tunately there is no local canning factory.
Cure or best treatment for lampass in
horses? —4ss3.
Administer a laxative, and put animal on
soft diet. Unless the membrane descends
below the level of the incisors, no serious
inconvenience may be experienced.
Some quick way of thrashing tick beans,
in quantities of 20 or 30 bushels? —4418.
Place the plants on a long sheet and drive
over them with a one-horse plain roller until
the grain is separated. The stems are then
forked off by hand and the grain pods, etc.,
fed through an ordinary winnower. The
drum of an old header could be modified at
a cost of about £4 10s. to make it suitable
for bean threshing; also an old harvester
might be used for the winnowing.
(1) What machinery is required for con-
verting lucerne hay into dust? (2) Where
to obtain machinery? (3) Current price of
lucerne dust, f.0.r., Sydney? (4) What con-
dition has lucerne hay to be in to> make
dust? —4514.
(1) alid (2) The dust accumulates during
chaffing and baling. We know of no machine
for the purpose. (3) First quality, about
10s. per hundredweight. (4) It must be
well cured, leafy and dry.
(1) Is the cultivation of figs profitable?
(2) Is the Mornington peninsula {Vic.)
suitable for fig-growing? (3) Would a rock
stratum 10 ft. below surface be detrimental to
cultivation of fig-trees? (4) Best varieties
for Vic,?- —4492.
(1). Yes, provided the trees are planted
on well-drained land, with a good percen-
tage of clay and a high lime content, and in
suitable climate. '(2) There are great varia-
tions in the peninsula soils, and no opinion i
could be given without inspecting the site. J
(3) That would depend on the composition !
of the overlying stratum. (4) Varieties most
in favor amongst southern growers are
Brown Turkey and Black Genoa.
(1) llow many liens can one man look
after? (2) How many chickens not in lay
and hens one and two years old would lie
have on hand? (3) Where can I get
N.S.W. Egg Board regulations? (4) Aver-
age price of eggs per dozen all the year
round in Sydney f—-4566.
(1) 800 to iOOO layers. (2) He would
have to raise a similar number of chicks
each year to the number of layers he is keep-
ing. This would allow for 50 per cent, being
cockerels and 50 per cent, pullets to replace
the second-year lieiis each season. (3) Sec-
retary, Egg Marketing Board. Mountain-
street, Sydney. (4) Average net price in
1928 was Is. 91d.: in 1929, is. 6d.; and in
1930, Is. 3fd. per doz.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Mulga” : A good plan to get rid of nut
grass, where there is much of it, is to plough
the ground in patches and put pigs on it.
enclosing them with a strong netted fence
that can easily be shifted. The pigs, if not
too w T ell fed, will turn up and eat the
nutty roots. When they have given the
ground a good rooting, shift them to another
patch, then go over the ground with a heavy,
close-toothed rake. After that, give it
another ploughing, and rake it over again.
Nut grass, if not checked and eradicated, will
soon ruin a good farm.
“Golightly” : A better plan than “A.L.P.’s”
(B. 24/6/’3l) is to mark in the lambing
paddock. Careful sheepmen have yards there
for this purpose; others carry their marking
yards about the run by truck or cart. The
gear consists of two or three coils of wire-
netting and ample hardwood stakes, with a
good long wing of wire-netting included.
There is no mothering difficulty when mark-
ing is done in the lambing paddock; it is
distinctly bad management to drive lambs
from one paddock to another before or after
marking. Yard overnight in hot weather.
In cold this is unnecessary unless the round
up is so badly managed that the lamhs are
run about until hot. When marking in
late spring and flies are bad, yard again
two days later and dress with fly oil. It
will then be effective.
“Floodmark” : When worms are prevalent
in sheep and lambs 1 find the following mix-
ture an excellent cure: 7oz. Milestone and
7oz. mustard to three gallons of water.
Having measured out the water take suffi-
cient from it to dissolve mustard and blue-
stone separately. When mixing mustard
pour water on gradually to prevent it lump-
ing. Hot water dissolves the Milestone
quicker than cold. Let stand and mix the
three together just before drenching. The
foregoing will dose 480 lambs or 360 two-
tootlis, or 240 aged sheep. Leave the sheep
in yard before drenching overnight. When
dosing keep the mixture well stirred. If
the orthodox dosing bottle, which, of course,
is best, is not available, a small sauce-bottle
makes a satisfactory doser. Having
drenched, leave the sheep in yard for three
hours.
“D.11’.R.” : Cow rugs (B. S/7/’3l) can
be made even cheaper than “Tallama” sug-
gests. Old wheat-bags split open and tarred,
painted or greased will keep a cow warm
and dry--one bag one rug. A farmer near
Tallamore (N.S.W.) saves all discarded
clothing and sews it on old wheat- or chaff-
bags, greasing the bag side to turn dew and
rain. He makes other rugs by spreading his
used newspapers open inside old chaff-bags
and greasing both sides. Three thicknesses
of paper are as warm as any bought rug, and
will last a winter.
“Hornby” : Don’t dissipate your wealth of
asli from fireplaces. Mix it with equal
quantities of any kind of sand and spread
it round the milking place, gate entrance
and other places where stock congestion
occurs. It wall form a surface nearly as
hard as cement and not as slippery. As tin
stock tramp it in, add more, and within a
week you’ll have a wet-resisting surface.
Attend in the same way to the calf-pen, and
you'll obviate potential losses from pul-
monary complaints and foot disease.
“Notwen”: With the market price of
rabbit-skins so low, why not use more on
the farm? Besides rugs, many small articles,
such as gloves and caps, can be quickly
made of them; and once Dad has got into
the habit of wearing rabbit-skin inner soles
he won’t be happy this wet weather without
them.
“Murrungurry” : Pigs that have never been
out of a sty are aggravating beasts on the
track. On long trips a good North Coast
(N.S.W.) drover takes a supply of pumpkins
or corn, and a trickle of grain now and again
overcomes any cantankerousness and teaches
the grunters to follow the rations. Watered
about sundown, and given their supper a>
dusk, they settle down fairly well, and
generally they will be nosing around the cart
in the morning. They are always ready for
tucker time; the drover can make them
finish a hard day well by going ahead and
“ringing the dinner bell.”
“Veritas”: Bananas intended for distant
markets (“E.H.M.” B. 8/7/’3l) must read'
their destinations green. A case arriving
partly ripe and partly green loses shilling'
in value, as the ripe fruit has to be picked
out and replaced with green before going
into the ripening room, or else sold at a
lower price as it stands. Fruit cut from
bunches showing one or two bananas ripe
would arrive in a very mixed condition,
probably partly “boiled.” Ripening fruit
generates heat, and a case is very quickly
affected, especially in trucks en route. This
applies particularly ill summer. A lot of
my w T ork consists of reports on bananas
arriving in mixed condition. The most
practical test for maturity is the rounded
appearance of the fruit, having regard to age
of plantation, type of soil, appearance of
plant, distance of destination and weather
conditions likely to be encountered en route.
“Dimon”: Ducks do better if provided
with a pond. The ideal place for them is
a swamp, about a couple of chains long, and
a chain wide. Many farmers drain or fill
in such a swamp, * especially in districts
where mosquitoes are bad. But there will
be no trouble from mosquitoes while ducks
have regular access to it; and to destroy
it is to lose a useful asset.

(1) llotic many species are there of the
Barrier Reef fish locally known as “China-
man’’ and what is its scientific name? (2)
Is it edible? (3) Is it true that it is
poisonous at certain times of the year? —4l6l.
(1) One species: Paradicichthys venenatns.
(2) At times. (8) Yes. Dr. P. S. Clarke,
of Cairns, has treated several eases of
Chinaman-fish poisoning.
(1) llow can I get a composer to write
the music for a song? (2) What Australian
firms publish songs? (3) How are pro-
ceeds of a published song divided?— 4s36.
(1) Paling and Co. would recommend a
composer. The usual charge is about £5 ss.
(2) In normal times many firms publish
songs, but most of them have temporarily
closed their publishing departments. It
would be very difficult to find a publisher.
(3) The usual royalty is 10 p.c. of retail
price, divided between composer and author,
if there are two interested.
(1) Will young budgerygahs ( love-birds),
taken wild, live in cages? (2) If not, why?
(8) How long do budgerygahs live?. (4)
What should they be fed on? —4577.
(1) No. They must be practically full
grown before taken from the nest. (2)
Because the parent birds feed them on pre-
digested food, for which there is no substi-
tute. (3) About 10 years. (4) When young,
maize meal, pollard and green stuff. When
full grown, canary, seed and green stuff
(lettuce).
(IV Can a voter unable through infirmity
or illiteracy to record a vote request the
presence of a friend in the booth to assist
him at a N.S.W. State election? (2) If
not, how can the vote be recorded in secret?
—4555.
(1) No. (2) Where infirmity precludes
an elector from attending a booth, he may
record a secret postal vote, but must be
able to place his signature on a certificate.
A marksman cannot vote by post. If any
person is blind or is incapacitated by any
other physical cause from voting in the
usual wav. or is unable to write, the deputy
returning officer, in the presence of the poll
clerk and scrutineers, marks the ballot-paper
according to the instruction of such person.
(1) In the present stage of progress in
aviation ichat is the quickest time in which a
journey round the earth could be made? (2)
Quickest time using public conveyances —-
railways, steamers, ’ planes, etc.? (3) When
was Jules Verne’s fictional SO days’ record
broken in fact? —-4675..
(1) Depends on route. Post and Gatty’s
'plane record of 8 days 15hr. Slmiu., which
beat the Graf Zeppelin’s' record of 211 days,
established in 1929, Avas made in fairly high
northern latitudes, and covered 16,000 miles.
At the equator the world’s diameter is over
24,000 miles. Special difficulties attending
an equatorial circuit make it impossible to
answer the question. (2) Record made in
1928 is held by J. 11. Mears, ah American—
-23 days 15hr. 21min.; distance covered.
19,400 miles. (3) Detailed- recotds are not
available, but in 1896 a ; rail-chm-steamer cir-
cuit was made in 64 days llhr. 20min., and
that record still stands.
(1) What is the highest peak that has
been climbed; by whom, and when? (2)
Has Mt. Everest been conquered? (3) How
do alpinists breathe in very high altitudes?
—4676.
(1) Mt. Kamet, in the Himalayas, 25,447 ft.
F. S. Smythe and party, July 1, 1981. (2)
Mallory and Irvine, who perished on the
mountain, were last seen climbing strongly
with only 900 ft. to go to the summit
(29,002 ft.), and their companions believe
they made the ascent. (3) Mallory and
Irvine used oxygen and so did Smythe, but
it has been proved that it is possible by
remaining at very high altitudes for some
days to accustom the lungs to the rarefied
air. On one of the attacks on Everest three
members of the expedition explored at
28,000 ft. without oxygen.
(1) During what years did the N.S.W.
Government run trawlers? (2) How many
State fish shops were established? (3) Was
the venture abandoned because of the poor
trawling grounds?- —4692.
(1) 1915 to 1923. (2) Twenty. (3)
No. The trawling grounds are among the
richest in the world. The enterprise was
a commercial failure.
I wish to build a small three-valve receiver
suitable for use with primary 11. T. and L.T.
batteries. (1) Most economical valves as
regards filament and plate current consump-
tion? (2) Would asM of this type receive
Sydney A-elass stations at speaker strength
at Windsor (N.S.W.)? (3) Minimum H.T.
voltage for satisfactory reception? (4) Most
economical type of A battery, and where
obtainable ? —4695.
(1) R.U.A. 230 for detector and first
L.F. ; R.C.A. 231 for last stage. The total
filament consumption is a quarter of an
ampere. (2) Yes. (3) 120 volts. (4)
Two Amplion type No. 229 Carboneeis.
Speakers, Ltd., 70 Clarence-street, Sydney.
These can be recharged at home without
electric current.
I have a three-valve short-wave receiver
consisting of a regenerative detector and two
low-frequency stages. (1) Would it- be
possible to 'add a high-frequency stage in
front of the detector? (2) What additional
equipment would be required? (3) Approxi-
mate cost? —4700.
(1) Yes. (2) Chief requirements are a
screen-grid valve, socket, aerial-grid coil and
mount, and a .00025 MF tuning condensor.
The chief difficulty would be the placing of
the extra stage in the receiver, which may
be done by putting the unit in a separate
metal box or, preferably, by refitting the
receiver in a larger metal cabinet. (3)
About £3 exclusive of cabinet.
(1) In what States must opticians be
registered? (2) Does registration in M.L.
entitle an optician to practice in Australia
without further examination? —4629.
(1) N. S. Wales, Tas., Q’land and S. Aus.
(2) No, except in the case of persons holding
the diploma degree of the Spectacle Makers’
Company of London or the British Optical
Association.
(1) What arc blennies? (2) What are
the peculiarities of the oyster blenny, and
does it kill oysters?— 467l.
(1) A fisherman’s term for many species
of fish too small to be worth catching. Many
varieties are amphibious and at low tide
scramble over moist rocks in search of food.
(2) It has a long sabre-like tooth on each side
of the lower jaw, and is often found curled up
within the shell of an oyster. Whether it
actually destroys living oysters is uncertain,
but it uses their shells as a nursery for its
young, its eggs being deposited in a mass on
their inner surface.
(1) What are the qualifications for em-
ployment as a surveyor’s chainman? (2)
What are his duties? (3) How long does
it take to become competent? —44B2.
(1) Ordinary intelligffice and physical fit-
ness. (2) To obey the surveyor’s instruc-
tions. (3) All there is to be learned could
be picked up in a month of practical work.
I joined the A I.F. on my 18th birthday.
By regulation no soldier could sail from
Australia before he attained the age of 18
years 6 months. I had just turned that
age when the Armistice was signed, Am
I entitled to the Victory medal?— 4s3s.
The Victory medal is issued only to those
who entered a theatre of war on duty. The
British war medal is issued to those who
left their place of residence and rendered
approved service overseas. You are not
entitled to either.
Suppose a firm is just able to pay the
loages of five men, how can it pay these men
on holiday at the end- of the year? I am
one of the five; will we have to suffer some
way?, —46ol.
Somebody will have to suffer. If they
are barely earning their pay from week to
week, obviously holiday pay can only come
from some other source. It could, of course,
be done by rationing—that is, if four could
do all the productive work of the five.
What are the qualifications of an elector
of the Vic. Leg. Council? —4430.
Following persons are qualified : owner of
property in one province rated on a yearly

lessee or assignee, where the share is the
equivalent of foregoing requirements;
graduate of any British Uni.; legal or
medical practitioner; minister of religion;
certificated schoolteacher; naval or mili-
tary officer; matriculated student of Mel-
bourne .Uni.

diture?—4sso.
(1) November 20. 1922. (2) At June
30, 1929, 31,279. (3) On the same date
2749. with an annual liability of £218,384,
of which £178,888 represented subsidy pay-
able from consolidated revenue. (4) Dur-
ing 1928-29, receipts were £537,310,. of which
officers’ contributions represented £420,468.
and expenditure was £539,180, of which
£475,147 was invested, bringing the total
invested to £2412,741 (at: cost). The aver-
age rate of interest earned at June 30, 1929,
was 5.483 p.c.

oped a white scale near the base. What icill
remove it? (2) Best fertiliser for rosea, and
when to apply? —4s74.
(1) Wash the trees once a week with
nicotine sulphate emulsified with soap, using a
small brush attached to a stick. (2) Super,

repairer working in a N.S.W. country toion?
(2) In the event of the employer paying
less than the award rate what redress has
the employee? (3) In the event of the
employee taking legal action against the eni-
ploycr who would have to pay costs?— 4227.
(1) Under the State award an employer
has the option of paying piece-work rates
or 2s. 5 2-lld. per hour. (2) and (3) He can
apply to an industrial magistrate for an order
directing the employer to pay the full
amount of any balance due. The magistrate
may award costs to either party.
What were the famous Celtic illuminated
manuscripts, their approximate date, and
what sort of designs were used in them?
—4570.
The most famous are the Book of Kells
(a.d. 080-700). the Book of Durrow (a.d.
050) and the Book of Armagh (a.d. 840).
They are distinguished by ambition of
design and extraordinary skill in execution.
The designs were linear, and when natural
objects and human figures were introduced
they were used purely as a vehicle for linear
pattern. The richest colors were used, often
with an introduction of gold and silver leaf.
The illuminators based their designs on those
of the goldsmiths, and in many cases the
same individual decorated a manuscript and
bound it in metal.
How to grow ferns from seed, and the
time to do it? —4558.
Pick off the frond bearing seed when it
is nearly withered and lay it in a compost
of sand, loam and leaf-mould. Sprinkle a
little earth over j,t, water lightly, and then
cover with glass. Spring (September to
November) is generally the best time for
the work. As the young ferns grow be spar-
ing with the water in order to make them
hardy and ready for pricking out into pots
or boxes.
(1) Proper time to sow gladioli seed in
■N.S.W-? (2) Best method of handling
cor inlets? (3) llow to hybridise varieties?
—4342.
(1) Autumn or spring. Sow in sandy
loam and leave the seedlings undisturbed
for at least two years. They can then be
dug, and, when planted in the third year
will bear flowers. (2) Put the conns in
deep boxes or open ground. Do not let
them flower in the first year. (3) Pollinisa-
tion by bees is one method; the other is
transfer of pollen by a camel-hair brush
from one flower to another, after which cover
the blooms with gauze.
What Were the circumstances in which the
Colonial Secretary over-ruled a M.L. Gov-
ernor on the subject of Leg. Council appoint-
in aits f —4518.
After the election of 1890, which gave the
Liberals a majority, the Conservative
Premier, Atkinson, refused to resign pending
the assembling of Parliament, and at his
request. Lord Onslow, the Governor, appointed
six more members to the Leg. Council, which,
with the new appointments, consisted of 26
Conservative and nine Liberal nominees. In
the first session of 1891 the Council rejected
or mutilated every important bill passed by
the lower House under Ballance’s leadership.
Ballance asked Lord Glasgow (who had suc-
ceeded Onslow) to make 12 new appoint-
ments to the Council, which would still
leave the Liberal nominees in a clear minor-
ity. Lord Glasgow would appoint only nine ;
to appoint more, he said, would be “an uncon-
stitutional interference with the liberties of
the Council.” The dispute Avas submitted to
the Colonial Secretary, avlio advised that the
Governor “must accept unreservedly the
advice of the Government.”
(1) What arc the different ‘'blocks’ a
batsman may ask for? (2) What are the
principles which determine the correct block
to be chosen? (3) When an umpire, is asked
to give block, docs he give it with his hand
over the wicket or standing where boiclcr
in going to bowl from? (4) Does umpire
stand in different position or use left hand
for left-handed batsman or left-handed
bowler? (5) What does an umpire intend
to convey when, just before bolder runs, he
waves his hand from side to side? —4668.
(1) A matter for his own discretion. (2)
Roughly, to give a batsman an idea of his
position between bowler and wicket. (3)
As requested by the batsman. (4) The
umpire always faces the bowler, right or left,
over or round the wicket. (5) Signal indi-
cates a boundary hit.
(1) What is the connection between Uni-
tarianism and Arianism, and what are the
differences? (2) What were the origins of
Unitarianism? —4468.
(1) Modern Unitarianism has no direct
historical connection with Arianism. Pure
Arianism teaches the pre-existence of Christ
and exalts Him to the level of deity as co-
creator of the universe. Modern Unitarians
proclaim H'is full humanity; ‘What He was
all men may become.” Dr. Martine.au. the
great exponent of the Unitarian position,
says : “The incarnation is true, not of Christ
exclusively, but of man universally, and of
God everlastingly.” Allans worship Christ.
Unitarians worship “His father and our
Father, His God and our God.” (2) It
arose independently in England, Italy, Tran-
sylvania and America through groups of
thinkers coming to the conclusion that
Trinitarianism is nowhere taught in the
Bible. The pioneers were Faustus and
Lselius . Socinus (1525-1604), whose views
were shared by John Milton. John Uocke
and Sir Isaac Newton. While anti-Trini-
tarian in theology, Unitarian churches no
longer stress theological issues. They wel-
come into the fellowship all who are willing
to unite “for. the worship of God and the
elevation of man.”

CATTLE CAMP
“CATTLE CAMP” WAS AWARDED A PRIZE OF £100 IN THE LATEST “BULLETIN” NOVEL COMPETITION.
By J.J. HARDIE
Synopsis : Margaret Kennedy, on her
way to Corella station, in North
Queensland, whither she has been in-
vited by Tom Donaldson, father of
her school friend Peggy, is rescued
from■ a seemingly inevitable coach
crash by Ken Craig. They go on
together to the station, and Margaret
falls under the spell of Craig's roman-
tic personality, though she resents the
fact that he is repeatedly doing
things that appear to her to put her
in his debt, such as letting her take
his favorite pony, Dawn, without
protest. He goes away to help a
queer character, Larry Nolan, with
his horses, and before- he returns
to Corella Larry gives him a
magnificent black, which he calls
Eaglehawk, and the popular opinion
regarding which is that Larry must
have pinched it as a foal. Ken takes
Eaglehawk with him when he goes out.
to take charge of the tcork at Cattle
Camp, where, some time later, Donald-
son and the girls unexpectedly arrive.
By the time they depart Ken, trying
to beat his growing feelings for Mar-
garet, has returned to the old reclusive
ways that her coming had disturbed.
Soon after he is badly injured in
saving one of his men from being
gored by a bull, and is brought in to
the homestead, where Margaret nurses
him, and rejects a somewhat offhand
proposed. Station life is suddenly
disturbed by the arrival of Mr. Borth-
wick, sent up by the city managers on
a visit _ of inspection. Borthioick has
a sinister understanding with the
station book-keeper. Heath, and to him
intimates prospective changes. He
makes Ken a big offer for Eaglehawk
and is refused. He determines that he
will get the horse somehow.
CHAPTER XVI.
CARINDA’S two hotels were full to over-
flowing. The rooms were reserved for
the married folk and a privileged few;
verandahs were crammed with stretchers;
swags were rolled out on any vacant spot
that offered. The yard was full of buggies,
buckboards and assorted vehicles. Saddles
hung over rails or were propped against the
yard, according to the habits of the owner
or his degree of thirst at the moment of
unsaddling.
Corella was there en masse. The stock-
men had arrived late in the evening and
had taken up their quarters in a half-
furnished cottage behind Ryan’s pub. “Nice
and handy to the horse-yard,” as Dusty
commented drily. Thereafter they sallied
forth in a body, and. spent the evening—
and most of the night—visiting.
Every station within miles had donned
its whitest moles, and flash hacks carried
expectant, thirsty riders over dusty tracks
from eveiy point of the compass to the
bare, glaring, sunbaked little township,
whose most thriving institution appeared
to be “the dump.”
Visiting was easy—no one was at home.
If by chance you happened to meet a lanky,
spur-clinking stockman steering a zigzag
course in the main—and only—street, the
formula was simple. The lanky one would
gaze owlishly a moment, then a hairy
hand would stretch forth. “Strike me dead
if it ain’t old Dusty! Comeanaveadrink!”
Whereupon all hands would grope a way into
the cloud of tobacco smoke surrounding the
bar, to be greeted uproariously by a babel
of voices. All the best people were there;
if you did not meet them that night, it
only meant that a temporary deficit in their
official capacity for booze had put them out
of action earlier than anticipated—but they
would be back later.
After a sticky, hot night, morning glared
hot and sudden on Carinda. The bar had
closed for a few short hours. Once again
the hair of the dog was in keen demand,
and good-natured Bill Ryan was hard at it
behind the bar, hoping he could keep things
going till his assistants got a bit of sleep.
Ken, fresh from an early shower, slipped
quietly from the Dew-drop Inn, as they
had , christened their cottage. He had 'not
seen Margaret so far, and his questing eyes
searched the hotel verandah, as he turned
into the street. A dusty form sprawled
in the roadway.. Ken recognised one of the
Ardwell stockmen, and with a broad grin
lugged him into' the shade, and left him
till he came to or till his friends claimed
him.
As lie looked up he became conscious
of a slim figure in cool white smiling down
at him-from-the top of the steps, and he
grinned boyishly.
“Morning, Margaret! Sleep well?”
“Sleep!” The mock indignation in her
voice barely triumphed over the laughter
bubbling in it. “The heat was bad enough,
but how could you expect anyone to sleep
through the row you men made?”
The girl moved down the rickety wooden
steps and turned up the dusty road, which
narrowed and swung through a waste of
stumps and rusty tins to emerge on the
well-worn coach route by which she had
come to Carinda.
Ken swung his long form alongside, and
glanced at his companion from the corners
of his eyes.
“Expecting rain?” he queried innocently,
his gaze on the gay sunshade Margaret still
carried unopened.
“All right for 3'ou to grin, any lad,” she
flushed, turning accusing eyes on him.
“Where were you last night? Drunk, too,
I suppose!”
Ken laughed happily down at the wide
hat of soft white straw that concealed her
face. “If anyone heard you now, they
would reckon we were married!”
“You great idiot!” she laughed back at
him.
“Always feel that way before breakfast?”
lie inquired.
“Usually worse than that!”
“Good thing I found out in time!”
He side-stepped quickly to avoid a jab
of the sunshade, then they moved on at a
more leisurely pace.
“But honestly, Ken, I didn’t sleep a wink
last night. That little room is like an oven,
and about four rooms away someone snored
till the walls rattled.”
“That would be old Mother King—
weighs twenty stone in her socks. They
had to screw the iron on the walls at Reedy
Creek after she went there —nails were
shaken out.”
“I’ll tell Mrs. King what you think of
her! But that was nothing to the noise
from the bar. Then someone serenaded us
in the most mournful voice you ever heard
—something about /It was only a beautiful
pitcher, in a beautiful golding frame!’
Heavens! I can listen to dingoes cheerfully
after that!”
“That’s only the preliminary! Wait till
to-night! Oh—er—are you—going to the
ball?”
“Oh, I might!” Margaret’s tone was care-
less.
“I’m not much of a dancer—got out of
the way of it—but will you keep me a few?”
“What’s your definition of a few?”
“Oh, about half a dozen?”
“We are modest!”
“Good-oh! Thanks!” he grinned mis-
chievously. “Oh, there’s another thing.
Can I nominate you for the Ladies’ Bracelet
to-day? I’m going to buy in Comet —
she’s full-sister to Flight, and stands a good
chance.”
“Why pick on me?” she queried in mock
seriousness. “Why don’t you ask Peggy?”
Ken grinned widely into her eyes. “Jim
Armstrong booked her nomination six
months ago. Well, that’s settled.”
“Oh, is it?” She stopped and faced him
suddenly, a note of appeal replacing the
levity in her tone. “Ken, will you promise
me something? I—l know you’ll think I’m
a wowser, but I just can’t explain—yet.
Don’t get drunk, Ken—l would hate to
see you like—like that. Will you promise?”
The man took her slim hands in his, and
looked gravely into the earnest eyes. “Why,
sure, Margaret! In any case, I wouldn’t
get tight to-day for all the tea in China!”
She smiled happily into the steadfast grey
eyes. “Thanks, Ken! I’m an awful wow-
ser, don’t you think?”
“You are! Don’t I get a drink at all?”
“We-ell—l won’t be too hard; I’ll leave
it to you—so long as you don’t”
“Right! And, now, are you walking to
Townsville, or shall we go back for break-
fast?”
“Heavens! I had forgotten! Are you
hungry?”
“No, but I have a thirst worth quids.
And all going to waste!”
Ken paused at the dusty front of
Carinda’s only store as a hail reached him.
Diagonally across the street stood the dila-
pidated verandah of rusty iron and un-
painted woodwork of Williams’s pub, whose
reputation equalled its appearance.
Mildly wondering, he walked slowly across
the dusty, sunbaked street. Wondering still
further, he discerned Mr. Heath, immaculate
in white, with a stranger who bore the
earmarks of everything Mr. Heath affected
to dislike.
“Hullo, Ken! Come in out of the sun.
This is Mr. Holland—Mr. Craig!”
Ken shook the flabby hand, and specu-
lated mildly on the stranger. His thick, dark
curly hair spread out under the back of his
hat; the eyes, small and hard, were un-
affected by the ingratiating smile on the
thin lips. His general flashy appearance,
added to a certain something about him,
suggested an extensive acquaintance with
the shady- side of horse-dealing.
Heath was talking affably. “I have just
been telling Mr. Holland that you could
be of more use to him than I. Mr. Holland
is buying horses for a show—buck jumpers,
outlaws—and he wants to know if we have
any on Corella.”
“Got many so far, Mr. Holland?” Ken
queried evenly.
“Half a dozen. Bought one at Linton
yesterday. She’s a wonder! Dargan’s Grey,
and Bobs and-all the buckjumpers you ever
heard about are only pig-rooters alongside
this mare. She’s as ugly as sin—hollow-
backed, one white eye and a-tail like a rat,
and she’s.as slippery as a bag of snakes!”
The short man waved his hands, and per-
spired profusely. “She’s skied all the fancy
riders, white, black and brindled, that Linton
can rake up. To-morrow I’m putting up
a fiver to say , that no man in Carinda can
ride her to a standstill. That’s what I
think about her! How about you having a
fly, Mr. Craig? Mr. ’Eath ’ere tells me
you’re a bit of a postage stamp.”
Ken shook his head decisively. “No!
I’m past the stage of looking for that sort
of thing. In any case, I don’t feel like
riding anything rough at present.”
“Oh, I forgot. Ken got badly knocked
about by a bull—just getting about again,”
interposed Heath.
“Well, well, that’s bad luck!” The little
man’s voice dripped sympathy. “Anyhow,
come and have a drink!” The two men
gravitated automatically to the crowded bar,
but Ken held back.
“No, thanks! I’m on the waggon this
morning. We’ll have it later, if you don’t
mind.”
“Come on! A small one won’t make
much difference—l’ll get a fresh bottle,
Jimmy!”
Jimmy, fat and untidy, banged three
glasses on the sloppy bar, and peeled the
foil off a bottle, with a hostile glance at
Heath as if the demand were a personal
insult.
Ken moved slowly forward. After all,
even if he distrusted Holland, there was
no need to advertise the fact.
He moved to the left of the stranger,
placing him between himself and Heath,
and threw.down a note.. “Well, as I’m stop-
ping at one, this' is my shout.”
Heath protested vigorously: “Not at all!
/ asked you to have a drink.. Here, help
yourself!”
Ken pushed the bottle towards Holland.
“Right-oh! Go ahead!”
The little man turned the bottle upside
down a couple of times. “I’ll chance the
fusel oil now!” He poured out a small nip,
then a larger one, which he pushed to his
right. “ ’Ow’s that, Mr. ’Eath?”
“That’ll do! My word—there’s a good
sort of a horse!”
The little man’s interest appeared to be
with them as he jolted a good three fingers
into the third glass before he recovered
himself. As he returned the bottle to the
sullen-eyed Jimmy one flabby hand dwelt
for a second over his own glass. Then he
turret! at Ken’s voice.
“Jack Westwood, of Gi’assmere—he’s
generally got something good under him.
He might shake up your outlaw to-morrow!
Here, go easy! Is that your idea of a small
drink?”
“My mistake—l looked round to see the
horse.” The little man was deeply apolo-
getic. “Here you are—l’ll take the big one.
Take your pick of the other two!”
Ken poured a little water in the middle
glass. “Well, here’s luck!”
“Cheerio!”
“Good luck, Mr. Craig!”
The three glasses settled on the bar
simultaneously. Ken refilled his with
water. He looked at the truculent Jimmy
at the far end of the bar: “Just about time
you cleaned out the tank, Jimmy!”
“What’s wrong with it?”
“Pongs a bit, that’s all!”
Heath laughed lightly. “Don’t suppose
they’re fussy about a few dead frogs. Any-
how, the whisky’ll kill the microbes. Excuse
me, Ken. I’ll see you later.”
Heath disappeared towards the back of
the pub. Ken and Holland started towards
the door, and the little man returned to
his subject.
“About them horses. It’s like this, Mr.
Craig. My brother runs a buckjumping
show, and I’m on the lookout for fresh
stuff for him. Now, have you anything
out there you want to get rid of? I know
that eveiy station has a few horses that’ll
buck till the cows come home, and when
they’ve bucked themselves out, they’re no
use for work, and neither is the rider.
In fact, they’re a damn nuisance.
They emerged from the dim light of the
bar. The glare of the sunlight on the
white road seemed to hit Ken like a sledge-
hammer. He stood still, swaying a little,
his hands groping at the verandah rail,
his brain whirling, bursting. Vaguely he
felt he must get back to the boys; but
everything was fighting against him, drag-
ging him back. That blasted road was
tilting like Hell. Now it rose perpendicular
in front of him.
Bash!
His senses were growing numb; his feet
weighed tons; his face felt strained as if the
skin had been stretched tightly to crack-
ing point.
Why did they keep dragging him back?
Get out of the way—damn everybody!
Bash!
But he would get there —get there.
Scotty Cameron, his freckled countenance
almost obscured by anew hat with a brim
like a verandah, and highly conscious of
the new pair of heavy, shining spurs clank-
ing low on his heels, awoke to the realisation
that the attention of his audience had
drifted.
He had run into Miss Kennedy outside
the store, where he expected to find Ken.
and at her cheery “Good morning, Mr.
Cameron,” Scotty felt that life left nothing
to be desired. He fairly wallowed in
reflected glory. It was like having your
picture in the papers.
Heads turned to gaze on the cool figure
in white under the sunshade’s gay splash
of color, and Scotty launched out on a
dissertation on the Corella horses, which,
in his opinion, were going to clean up the
entire programme. .
Frankly puzzled, he followed the girls
rigid stare.
From Williams’s verandah across the
road came the sound of argument, where
two well-oiled cattlemen were laying down
the law on some moot, point of bovine
conduct.
Nothing unusual there!
Then his moving gaze stopped suddenly,
centred on the tall, familiar figure balancing
in undecided fashion above the few rickettv
steps in front of the bar door.
Seemingly oblivious to the presence or
the purpose of the steps, the figure lunged
forward as if spurred by some sudden
impulse, and crashed heavily in a heap
in the deep, grey dust of the street.
“Ken!”
The boy sprang to the aid of the sway-
ing figure, bracing itself on hands and knees,
arms wide apart in a vain attempt to
steady the maelstrom whirling about him.
Margaret, rigid and numb, watched
Scotty struggling with the fallen one.
This was the man who, an hour ago, had
promised that this thing would not happen
—promised, with a look in his eyes that
she dared not meet!
God! Were all men alike—surely not
this one! Petrified, she watched the scene.
Scotty’s new hat had fallen off, his vivid
red head jerked to and fro as he struggled
to help the man v r ho, in her eyes, was
infallible. He was up! The pair staggered.
“Oh!” The cry escaped from her frozen
lips as her horrified eyes saw Scotty crumple
to the ground under a terrific swing from
the man he was aiding.
Then she saw Ken pitch heavily on top
of him. and lie still. She started forward,
then stopped. Men were running from all
directions.
“A fight! Who is it?”
With a sense of relief she heard the
level, penetrating voice of Dusty Rhodes
pouring forth a stream of crimson profanity,
and took advantage of the confusion to slip,
white-faced and sick at heart, across to
the sanctuary of her room.
The full moon bathed Carinda in a
clear, almost fierce radiance that showed up
the lighted windows as sallow, oblong
patches. Blistered paint and glaring tin
roofs lost their bare harshness, and the dim.
soft velvet of the shadows added that
magic touch which wakes romance in the
matter of fact and turns to mellow claret
the vinegar of the cynic.
The yellow light which blamed from the
wide-flung windows and doors of Ryan’s
hall glared brief impudence on the reigning
brilliance outside, then ceased abruptly
in wan surrender.
The hall was full to discomfort, due to
some extent to the similar condition of
some of the guests. Many a man has
remained steady in the face of a good day
at the races, where the universal greeting
from sunrise to the bullock’s walkabout is
“Comeanaveadrink,” has entered the ball-
room walking on air, and after one waltz
has left it on his ear.
All the married men were there, perforce
—and perspiring. Every female within
a hundred miles, married, single or other-
wise, would as soon have missed her own
funeral as stayed away from the Race Ball.
All the young bucks were trying to look
older, the middle-aged ones tiying to appear
younger. Some lounged in little knots,
furtively watching the dancers, screwing
their courage to the point of asking for
“the next.” The only absentees were they
who had no time for dancing—either from
shyness or from physical inability, that
latter and scattered band whose inability
to attend was due to lack of staying power,
and who had now reached the end of their
perfect day—in oblivion.
Even the groups of excited, giggling gins
that peered in at every window on the “big-
pfella corroboree” were taking in gestures
and mannerisms, to be reproduced in panto-
mime to the uttermost detail to their admir-
ing relatives for months to come.
The night was full of noises.
Down towards the river a chain rattled
and a teamster’s dog barked short and
gruff, scattering a mob of foraging goats
which fled with bells clanging melodiously.
Somewhere a horse whinnied.
From the direction of Williams’s pub
bursts of discordant song floated, and the
low, steady conversation of a little group
of men squatted on their heels discussing
the day’s racing formed a background to
the central disturbance —the shuffling of
dancing feet, the wailing lilt of old
Jim Hall’s fiddle, jealous of the rival
throb and sway of the concertina, and
the efforts of the two would-be soloists, all
caught and knitted into a semblance ot
rhythm and melody by the stout lady at
the piano.
The tall figure. moved hesitatingly from
the shadows of the yard towards the back

porch of the hall. A waltz was in progress,
and the man gained the shelter of the door-
way unperceived. His hungry eyes roved
feverishly over the crowded dancers. Un-
consciously, to gain a wider view, he moved
into the doorway, so that the full blaze
of the light fell on the bloodshot eyes
staring from the grim face. The roving
glance checked—settled on a couple coming
towards him.
Margaret Kenedy’s frock, simple, almost
severe, in its lack of frills and ornamenta-
tion, which seemed to be the prevailing
standard, suited the wearer—and her mood
—to perfection. Peggy, in a fluffy creation,
was having a hilarious evening. Jim Arm-
strong seemed to monopolise her, and spent
most of his time apologising profusely to
his partner and other people’s partners.
Jim’s attention was centred on Peggy—
steering her through the maze of dancers
was a mere secondary consideration.
Anyhow, his horse had won the Brace-
let—in Peggy’s name—and everything in
the garden was lovely to-night.
Looking up suddenly, he caught sight of
the figure in the doorway, and beckoned
vigorously. “Come on, Ken—were camped
up at the other end!”
But the man paid no attention, and Jim,
in perplexity, resolved to grab him next
round.
Twice Margaret had passed the doorway.
Drawn by the intensity of the gaze, she had
suddenly become conscious of the man
standing there. Her partner felt her start,
but the sudden smile and rush of talk in
contrast to her previous quietness left him
too bewildered to look for the cause.
The tall figure stood motionless, expect-
ant, when the girl met his glance; then, as
she looked quickly away—he stiffened, his
hands clenched tightly. Still he waited, and
still the girl looked past the spot where he
stood, as if the doorway were empty.
The muscles on the square jaw flickered
and grew tense; a fire was burning fiercely
within him, and as he saw Margaret danc-
ing with Heath, smiling into the sallow face,
a flame, murderous in its intensity, leapt
into his eyes.
He reeled out into the open and gripped
the rails of the yard till the knuckle-joints
showed white through the tan. He felt
desperate, itching to kill something or some-
one, to grip a throat and squeeze it—so!
if he could only find Buck Holland!
A lone horse in the yard eyed him imper-
sonally. The man’s gaze fell on the animal
standing dejectedly in the moonlight, head
sagging, one hip down. In his seething brain
certain phrases were recurring as if they had
been left there by a white-hot branding-
iron: “Hollow-backed, rat-tailed, ewe-
necked—ugly as sin!”
The man clambered heavily into the yard.
The mare turned an ugly head at the
intruder, its unshapeliness accentuated bv
the cold, snake-like glare of one white eye.
The man moved to one side, studying the
brand on her shoulder—S2Q. That clinched
it!
A fierce deliberation characterised his
movements. His face was grim and set,
but a wild, unholy joy seemed to blaze
from his eyes. Slipping out of the yard, he
returned with saddle and bridle.
The mare snorted with nervous forebod-
ing. As the man advanced she swung her
hindquarters to lash out, and at the same
instant a bridle slashed viciously down.
Almost before she had vvheeled the man
was at her shoulder.
The little group of men discussing the
rotten odds they had got that day looked
at one another for a silent second, then like
one man rose to their feet and dashed for-
ward to peer through the rails.
Inside the hall a dance had ended, and
perspiring couples were awkwardly making
their way back to the forms that lined the
walls. At a sudden yell from the rear door-
way scores of eyes saw a hat wave excitedly.
“Hi! Somebody ridin’ the wall-eye!”
Few couples reached their seats. In two
seconds the narrow doorway was jam bed
with a frantic mass of men struggling to
get out. Some vaulted through the windows,
scaring the life out of gaping gins. Some
of the women were not far behind the men.
In less than two minutes the hall was
empty. Men and women crowded round I he
yard, perching on any coign of vantage,
throwing breathless questions at one an-
other.
“Who is it?”
“Whose horse is it?”
Inside the yard rose a cloud of dust, as
the mare, her back bent like a horseshoe,
bucked, wheeled and spun, under the demon
sitting like a limpet on her back. She was
undergoing anew experience. This was no
cautious rider with an eye on a soft spot
to fall on; this was a fiend, immovable
and madly reckless, goading her on, treating
her hitherto infallible, tricky twists as if
they were mere pig-roots.
The crowd on the rails gasped at the
regular bang! smack! smack! as an arm rose
and fell. A wide strap lashed the bucking,
squealing demon to fury. Down the
shoulder—under the flank. Bang! smack!
bang!
The crowd was tense with excitement as
the infuriated mare reared high and poised,
forelegs pawing the air, on the point of
balance. Breaths were held; the silence was
deathlike. Then a long-drawn “A-ah !” as
the mare dropped, bucked, twisted and
kicked up in one continuous lightning move-
ment.
Margaret, clutching Peggy’s arm, asked
breathlessly. "What is it? Who is it?”
although perfectly certain of the identity
of the man on that devil-horse, and why
lie was there.
“It’s Ken, Margaret! Oh, he’ll be killed!
It’s the Linton outlaw that Jim told us
about. Look!”
A shout and a scatter from the rails, then
a thud reached them.
Margaret paled, and strained forward,
peering into the dust-cloud.
“He’s still there!”
“Good man!”
“Stick to her, Ken!”
“Tried to crush him on the rails!”
The girl stood on her toes listening to
the savage grunts, the squealing, the thud-
ding hoofs, and the whack! whack! of the
strap that came to her ears in monotonous
regularity.
The crowd began to cheer—the mare was
tiring. Then a pause. Men clambered
wildly over the rails and a chorus of ex-
cited applause broke put: "Rode her to a
standstill!” “God, can’t she buck!” j
“Good on yer, Ken!”
The girls turned slowly back to the hall,
Peggy chattering excitedly, Margaret silent,
but filled with a glow of exultation.
As they reached their comer a wild,
hilarious figure dashed in, grabbed Peggy,
and whirled her round and round him,
breathless, protesting: “Did you see it?
Talk about bfick! Oh, I’ll never call myself
a rider again!”
“Jim! You’re shaking me to bits! Let
me go!”
“Jim! Where is he? Where did Ken go?”
Margaret broke in.
“What do you think! Rode that she-
devil to a standstill, belted ten different
kinds of dust out of her—the only man
that ever stuck her. And he gets, off, pulls
off his saddle, and, ‘Let down the rails,’ he
says. Hunts the mare out, everybody
crowding round him and poking bottles at
him, and he walks through the mob—never
speaks to a soul! Fact! You would swear
he never saw them! Dumps his saddle at |
the Dew-drop Inn, and goes bush all on his
own.” He wheeled, still laughing excitedly:
“What did you think of it, Alan?”
The old head stockman was beaming.
“I missed the first half, but the rest was
worth seeing. I wish old John Simpson, of
Linton, had seen his outlaw. Didn’t he
lay on to her!” Hip grin gave way to a
puzzled expression. “That’s the queerest
part of it—can’t understand it at all. It’s
the first time I’ve ever seen Ken belt a
horse like that. You would think he had
a personal grudge against her.”
The music struck up and Margaret rose.
“I’ll leave Jim to look after you, Pegs!
I’m going to bed. Uncle Alan will see me
across the way.”
Peggy’s blue eyes opened in astonishment; i
then they softened in understanding. “Good j
night, dear; I won’t be long!”
From the verandah outside her room,
Margaret looked with shining eyes up into
the wonderful blue where the stars sparkled
like diamonds on a background of rich
velvet. |
“Good night, B03H” she whispered. “I ■
know just how you feel!”

Out on the downs west of Carinda, where j
the track to Corella and God-knows-where \
parts the waving grass like a bullet-furrow, ;
a big, red dingo, loping homewards in the
moonlight, halted suddenly with forepaw
in the air, and froze immobile. A lone
horseman passed, hunched, listless, weary,
on a big bay horse that swung along at a
tireless, mile-eating walk, anxious to reach
home and decent grass after that trampled
Carinda paddock.
The red dog relaxed, sensing the un-
seeing indifference of his natural enemy; j
then, with studied impudence, he crossed the 1
road with a supercilious sniff at the fresh
tracks and passed like a shadow into the
long grass on the other side.
(To be continued next week.)
Fool’s Tryst.
Yet I shall be one hour as kings should be,
But are not, or as fairy princes were
In the brave days of blessed memory;
For I shall be with her!
Words are harsh masters, and their malice
mars
The arabesque complexity of dreams;
To me as lovely and licentious stars
To lonely night she seems.
Smile, if it please you, and, mere scorn
contents!
She is the refuge from the things that are ;
At once life’s reason and its recompense,
Alike star-mist and star.
And when dusk drowns, as in dissolving fire,
The eternal sequence of time’s sombre sea,
And pain-drugged life forgets its blind
desire.
Its long Gethsemane,
We’ll meet, take hands and smile the old,
old way,
Sweeter than blood, and bitterer than
brine;
And I shall not be happy, only gay,
Exalted with wild wine
Of passion. (Ah, immortal irony!
Heedless of crying tides that lap and lave,
Ship-bones disgorged of the devouring sea,
Spent ships no love could save!)
Unheeding aught save that one avatar
Merges a million separate images.
As though Heav’n blent into one blinding star,
Life to one loveliness.
And she? Ah! never, sure, was fool so fond
As I! This will she note —eyes, lips, still
fair,
Glassed in the dim sea! If aught broods
beyond,
How should she know or care?

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Moonee Valley races last week-end threw
some light on prospects for the Australian
Hurdle, to be decided - at Caulfield next
Saturday. For instance, Full Hand, who is
regarded as the most dangerous rival of
Cockcrow, registered his first win over the
battens. A week previous he was runner-
up at Caulfield to Isocrates, who was not
entered for the Australian Hurdle. Though
Full Hand scored, running away over the
last furlong, by four lengths from Gratify,
lie galloped sluggishly in the early stages.
Bob Inkson never eased the pressure on Full
Hand after hitting the front. Was he afraid
of the gelding quitting? Opinions are
divided on this point.
Pitoota, a stable-mate of Olina, led from
start to finish in the Mount Cotterell Jump-
ers’ Flat. As he was not entered for the
big event at Caulfield, the inference is that
H. E. Connolly places a lot of dependence
on Olina. It may be that the latter horse
will, as in the Grand National, fight out
the issue, with Cockcrow. Since his Flem-
ington triumph, the Crowdennis gelding has
not been saddled up in public, H. N. Leon-
ard and trainer taking the view that jump-
ers, as well as Cup candidates, can be over-
raced. If the track be firm, Longlands will
have to be taken into serious account. He
was third in the V.A.T.C. Leamington
Hurdle on July 18, and shaped decently in
the Jumpers’ Flat which Pitoota annexed.
Kendler, bandaged on his doubtful foreleg,
ran last in that event, which must have been
discouraging to “Darcy” Eccles. It will be

OF THOSE HIT-A.ND-RUN
you READ ABOUT "
one of the weakest Australian Hurdle fields
on record.
Ancient Mariner is an apt name for the
Trafalgar gelding that landed the Lindsay
Gordon Steeplechase. As the saying goes,
he is almost “old enough to vote.” So far
from being withered by age, Ancient Mari-
ner outgalloped all opponents, with the
exception of Patriotic, and had tfiat steeple-
chase recruit vanquished at the last fence.
Bang Bang finished a poor third. A late
plunge by C. T. Godby and his followers
made Romeo favorite. Romeo belongs to
Wallace Mitchell, the bookmaker, to whom
he has proved expensive. Kentle and Best-
man share favoritism for the Australian
Steeple, to be run on August 8. Bob Inkson
will ride Bestman in place of W. H’owson.
Ferner has a number of adherents, but Bang
Bang has eased somewhat, consequent on
the “Valley” failure. Ancient Mariner is
hardening.
There was plenty of racing excitement in
Melbourne last week. At Epsom on the
Tuesday an inquiry was opened into the
running of Nullabor in the Trial Hurdle.
Next day the stewards disqualified the horse,
trainer (S. W. Biggins) and jockey (D.
Zealley) for 12 months. Appeals have been
lodged. On top, of this came the announce-
ment of E. A. Connolly’s temporary retire-
ment from horse ownership. “Con” had a
critical illness last year, and nervous excite-
ment endangers his health. An apprentice
jockey rode Ithuriel for him at Epsom, and
shaped so badly that he was suspended for
two months for incompetence. Connolly was
exonerated, but he probably found the ex-
perience too wracking. All of his horses are
to go up for immediate sale.
Duncan’s suspension for a month at
Moonee Valley was the culminating sensa-
tion. He captured the Derrimut Handicap on
Green Moth, and survived a protest for inter-
ference lodged by the rider of Indian Force.
It transpired that a crack from his rival’s
whip had forced the reins out of Duncan’s
hands. This occurred near the finishing post.
Duncan was stood down by the stewards
for crossing the field too sharp'ly at the home
turn and caused interference to Mutcha.
Last-named belongs to James Wilson, the
Queenscliff veteran. Mutcha might have won.
His full brother, Marrapu, was vanquished by
Lord Pat in the Sunset Welter at the close of
the afternoon. Duncan easily heads the list
of winning jockeys for the season in Mel-
bourne, despite having been suspended twice
—for a month at Rand wick (A.J.C.
Autumn meeting) and for just over a fort-
night at Williamstown. He must be writh-
ing at a third infliction of punishment.

For Caulfield on Saturday:—
Australian Hurdle : Cockrow, 1; Olina, 2 ;
Full Hand, 3.
Malakoff Stakes; Waterline; next, Spang.
Brflzenface was a brilliant three-year-old in
the spring, but he has been a sad disappoint-
ment since he won the A.J.C. Clibborn
Stakes. That race, succeeding as it did a'
strenuous second to John Buchan in the
Trial Stakes at the same meeting', seems to
have taken all the heart out of him; it may
be one more case of a good sprinter being
ruined by running him beyond his distance.
Brazcnface was backed again—made a warm
favorite, in fact—for a division of the Flying
Handicap at Moorefield, and for four fur-
longs of the six there was nothing else in
it. But Labor Girl (7 to 2), who is little
more than a pony, yvent after him between
the four- and five-furlong posts, caught him
in the straight, and beat him home by a
couple of lengths, Black Dina (3 to 1) being
third and Gipsy’s Land fourth. Labor Girl
is a three-year-old by Wolaroi—Waterproof.
The bookmakers knew all about her pace;
still, a few of her supporters got fives.
There was spirited betting on the July
Handicap. When bags were closed it was
5 to 2 Antiochus and Tortoni, 9 to 2 Don
Moon, 5 to 1 Dreamdale and 7 to 1 Flinders
-—figures which show how careful McShort-
odds is these days. The handicapper had
seemed rather hard on Don Moon in award-
ing him 9st. 61b., but at the home turn it
looked as if the old fellow’s disheartening
run of minor places had come to an end,
so well was he travelling for Bartle. Appear-
ances were deceptive, for Flinders cut down
the ancient and won by a couple of lengths,
Dreamdale being another three lengths off
and Antiochus fourth. Flinders is owned
and trained by William Kelso, and was
ridden by his apprentice, Weiss.
The locally-trained Beau Dennis had an
all-the-way win in the Hurstville Mile, and
as he went out at 20 to 1 the bookmakers
rejoiced. The top weight, Ring Boy (5 to
1), was catching him .so fast that Pratt, the
rider of Beau Dennis, must have been glad
when the judge’s box loomed up. First Acre,
who was favorite, was third, just ahead of
Tom Pinch.

The immemorial East seems to cotton
to Australian racing administrators. Most
of the big racing clubs in India and east
from there have at one time or another had
an Australian among their chief executives,
a notable instance being Jack Higgins, once
chief steward to the A. J.C., who, after some
years of service in Australia, returned to
fill the same office in the Calcutta Turf Club
which he had previously occupied before
going back to his native land for the A.J.C.
job. The latest to make tracks in that direc-
tion is Dr. Heslop, the well-known Victorian
vet, who was until recently one of the V.R.C.
stipes. He goes to Rangoon in Burma, where
he is certain to enhance his Australian
reputation.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Bob Thornton (list. 3flb.) journeyed
from Sydney to wrest the middleweight title
from Ambrose Palmer (list. 511 b.) at Mel-
bourne, and accomplished the feat, though in
an unsatisfactory fashion. Thornton fea-
tures a straight left and a swinging right,
and landed twice with the right in the first
round, but Palmer continued to bore in,
using his own straight left to advantage.
Many of Thornton’s swings were wasted on
tfie atmosphere, but one drew blood from
an eye in the third. The end came in the
referee’s corner in the fourth. After some
swift exchanges. Palmer landed a right
which was decidedly low. Thornton dropped,
but recovered quickly, to be crowned victor
on a foul.
* * H= *
Norman Gillespie, who has held the Com-
monwealth lightweight championship for a
couple of years, will not be 24 until next
November, but he fought like a worn-out old
man against Bobby Delaney at Leichhardt
last Friday night, and was stopped in five
rounds. Delaney (9st. 81b.) won all the
way. His right to the chin dropped Gilles-
pie (9st. 71b.) before the first round finished.
Right uppercuts upset the champion also
in the second and third. Gillespie went again
to the floor when he fell, evidently from
exhaustion, in the fourth, and was so badly
beaten before the next round had gone far
that the referee declared for Delaney.
“Mitt Shover” ; American Micky Walker,
undisputed middleweight champion of the
world, recently found himself getting too
heavy for his class, so aspired to the heavies.
Last week he fought a draw over 15 rounds
with Jack Sharkey, and in the earlier rounds
made a much better showing than his oppo-
nent. Sharkey fought back hard, however,
and as he weighed 14.2 J to Walker’s 12.14
he made up his leeway against the smaller
man in the closing stages.
Footbrawl
The most horrible happening N.S.W. has
been subjected to since the Lang Govern-
ment was returned to power occurred at
Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday, when
the young Queensland Rugby Union side
walked all over the players from the Ma
State, final figures reading 28-8 in the
tourists’ favor (5 tries, 3 converted goals,
one penalty and one field goal to a converted
try. and a penalty goal). Save for a brief
period at the beginning of the second half
when, with scores 15-0 against them, the
Welshmen desperately tried to take command,
the losers were outplayed forward and back
and went all to pieces in the closing stages.
Chief credit for the win must go to the
Queensland forwards. Fast and untiring, they
left the Blue vanguard standing in the loose
work while marking relentlessly and tackling
like demons. The backs were little inferior in
the matter of attending to the opposition, and
the way both van- and rearguard backed
each other up in attack and defence was a
treat to witness. The beaten side was
strangely sluggish for most of the game
and showed signs of stalcness, to which the
elaborate preparation it had undergone may
have contributed. Except for Cerutti, hardly
a forward lived up to his reputation, and
the . Queensland tackling showed some of tli ■
“shiners” up badly. Malcolm played a sound
if unenterprising game behind the scrum,
but was badly supported by Newton and Ben
Egan. Towers did some good things, as did
Tolhurst, though inclined to mishandle.
Palmer was too slow for the opposition. Ross,
after a shaky opening, played finely, but on
the day the Queensland full-back, Steggall.
took the honors, his play being almost fault-
less, though he sometimes failed to find the
line. Lindsay was the best of the wingers, a
powerful, pacy runner. Hayes, who opened
the Maroon score with a nice field goal, had
two first-class men in front of him in five-
eighth P. Clark and scrum-half Bennett.
In the forwards, Reville, J. Clark. Ritter and
Whyatt were, if possible, a trifle more con-
spicuous than their mates. The game was
fast and open, played at a clinking pace, and
deserved a far greater crowd than the 12,000-
odd who attended.
* * * *
For the most part, the Sydney Rugby
League competitions provided uneventful foot-
ball. At the Sports Ground, Eastern Suburbs
increased its lead by beating South Sydney
23-10 in a dull and ragged game, full of bad
handling. Lynch, as usual, was the star in
the Eastern backs, scoring 2 tries and kick-
ing 3 goals, two of them from the. field.
Western Suburbs had a hard fight against
University at Pratten Park, putting on steam
in the second half and winning by 17-11 after
Uni. had led at half-time. North Sydney
and Newtown provided a dreary exhibition
at Marrickville, the Northerners eventually
getting home by 9-3. St. George, on the
home ground at Earl Park, scored from Bal-
main in another uneventful game, the final
scores reading 23-6. Eastern Suburbs now
leads by four points in the competition, with
Western Suburbs second. St. George ties with
North and South Sydney for third place, so
there should be a hard go between these
teams for a possie in the semi-finals four.

Saturday’s Melbourne games, staged in
wind, rain and mud, were a sort of rehearsal
for the finals, in that the four leading teams
met, Carlton and the Tigers at Richmond;

Footbrawl
“Organiser”: Strikes are not as common
in foothall circles as the Comrades would like
to see them, but a recent Victorian happen-
ing shows the seed lias been planted. A
country club known as Sea Lake recalled
its selection committee by an overwhelming
vote and appointed anew one. This speedily
incurred opprobrium by replacing an absentee
with another player who was not on the
emergency list. The team then struck until
the blackleg was removed. He withdrew
voluntarily after 50 minutes’ argument, and
the supporters of solidarity went on the
field. They got the father of a towelling from
their opponents. Still, the cause was tri-
umphantly vindicated.
“Fitzcray”: The war between the West-
ralian and Victorian football heads concern-
ing the transfer of Hough is still on. West-
ralia absolutely declines to release its err-
ing child, as it considers him, to a Victorian
foster-mother, and there the matter rests.
The Westralian end, however, has issued a
sort of unofficial pronunciamento couched in
the most guarded language. Boiled down
it resolves itself into a polite expression of
conviction that the Vies, have so little
respect for the truth that it would be inadvis-
able to hang even a politician on their
evidence.
“Hotham”: One of the worst sufferers
from that Victorian football depresh (B.
22/7/’3l) is North Melbourne, a club which
came over some seasons ago from the Asso-
ciation to the League and has never been
quite the same since. So bad is North's
case that it has had to go to the League
finance committee for help. This was forth-
coming, and has been augmented by a fine
sporting gesture on the part of the affluent
Geelong club, which handed over its share of
the gate in a recent match with North.
H* V
“Old Q.”: Queensland barrackers got
something of a shock when the Maroons’
Rugby Union side took a hiding from
Newcastle, helped by Waratah Malcolm.
Though the tourists were .just off the train
after travelling all night, Newcastle deserved
the win by 18-12 (4 tries, 2 penalty goals
to 2 tries, 1 goal and 1 field goal). New-
castle football has been coming back rapidly
to the old-time standard, when the coalies
were always a formidable snag on their own
midden for visiting sides. On this occasion
they outstayed their opponents, scoring
heavily in the closing stages.
❖ ❖ ❖ %
“Old Q.”: Among the personalities down
in Sydney with the Queensland Rugby Union
team are Keith Horsley, manager of the
side, and Dave Williams. Horsley is quite
a pup for the position he holds, for he only
gave np active football last season, when he
retired from the Y.M.C.A., in which he
figured as centre-threequarter. He was
selected as a reserve for the State against
M.L. in 1929, and since then has been
prominent in Union official circles. Williams,
who is Queensland’s representative on the
Australian selection committee, is a hardy
veteran who has been capped 16 times for
the State against N.S.W., M.L. and the
Maoris, while he also played for Australia
against the All Blacks in 1913 and 1914.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: Australian Rugby Union
followers who have been under the impres-
sion that Australian players have returned
to the international rules are wondering
whether this is the case. When the Maori-
land Universities side was here some weeks
ago, injured players were replaced in nearly
every match. In the Queensland-Newcastle
match last week a replacement was allowed.
This is in direct variance with the inter-
national rules. In Sydney there is another
infraction practised every Saturday, when
the players leave the field for the dressing-
rooms at half-time. Under the rules which
are now supposed to govern play in Aus-
tralia, as elsewhere, this is forbidden. Play-
ers must stay on the field for a short rest
interval and then carry on with the game.
Why the shandygaff policy?
“Gash Amateur”: The first Australian
Rugby Leaguer subject to the “export
tax ’ of £2OO per head which the English
League is alleged to have undertaken to pay
its Australian cobbers for poached players is
Vic. Armbruster, the big Queensland forward.
He has been signed up by Rochdale Hornets,
one of the Lancashire professional clubs, and
will leave in time to take; part in the open-
ing games of the next North of England
season in September, the scrap of paper
whereby the Englishmen undertook to
impose a residential qualification of two
years on Australian players having been torn
up and chucked to the winds some time ago.
Armbruster (called “Armbuster” once) has
been one of the best forwards the League
game has seen. He played for N.S.W. in
1922, before going to Queensland, so he is
by no means in the juvenile class. It is
worth noting that though the Australian
Leaguers announce that they have accepted
the “ export tax” scheme, a cable states that
the English League denies that the matter
has been finalised. In view of past experience,
the Australian body will be well advised to
watch its step.
Racquet and Bawl
“Shrewsbury”: “Bunny” Austin, the Eng-
lish youngster who pulled the Davis Cup
match against America out of the fire, was
a Lepton boy before going up to Cambridge,
where he first began to figure in first-class
tennis. At Repton he had been a notable
cricketer, and was a sound tip by the experts
for a cricket Blue, and probably higher
honors later on. First-class batsmen are as
plentiful m England as blackberries, while
until recently it was the other way about
with tennis players, so. the Reptonian’s
cross-over to the summer game was all to
the good.
* * * *
“Let”: Norman Brookes, who has been
on a world tour, has forwarded an account
of a talk with the donor of the Davis
Cup, now Governor of the Philippines.
Brookes suggested that two new zones
should be created in the interests of
economy, and Davis was favorably im-
pressed. I he suggested new zones are Aus-
tralia, Maori land and South Africa, and
China, Java, Japan, the Philippines, Siam,
Honolulu, India and Papua, Lord Howe
Island having been unaccountably omitted.
Davis will submit the proposals to the
Yankee tennis heads, but will not hear of
the South African suggestion that the Cup
be played for every two years in future
instead of annually.
“Centre Court”: An interesting personal-
ity in international tennis is Elizabeth Ryan,
a non-starter at Wimbledon, owing to an in-
jury. Right up in the first class as a player,
the young woman lias reached the final of
the women’s singles four times, but has
always had her light doused in the final
rally. Nevertheless, her name figures on the
championship list, for last year she won
the women’s doubles in partnership with
Helen Wills and the mixed doubles with
Australian Jack Crawford. She is known
as the woman without a country. American-
born and an American representative, she
later took up domicile in England. Under
tennis conventions she is not permitted to
represent either country, though she would
certainly be a first pick for both.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Glcnelg” : Rufus Stewart, of South Aus-
tralia. just returned from his journey to the
British open golf championship, is of opinion
that the standard of the game has fallen off
a lot since he was there three years ago,
and that there are few good pros, coming
along; Henry Cotton is outstanding. In
America it seems to be the other way about.
Stewart is emphatic in saying that if he
is ever chosen to represent Australia over-
seas again, he will not go as a lone hand,
the strain for a single player being too heavy.
Other countries sent teams, and if one player
lost form there was always another to step
into the breach.

“Sandringham”: Victoria’s amateur golf
championships begin in Melbourne next
week, the venue being the Yarra Yarra
club’s course. Entries total over 70, most
of the leading Victorian lilywhites being in,
including M. J. Ryan, last year’s winner
and holder of the Australian title in 1929.
Among the outlanders who have put their
names down are R. H. Bettington. of
N.S.W., an old Oxford golf and cricket Blue,
and K. Barker, of Westralia. It is not often
that the far-off Gropers attend the big east-
ern events, and Barker’s enterprise deserves
to be rewarded with success.
“Hotham”: There was great tribulation
among depressed golfers when it was an-
nounced that entrance fees for the open,
amateur and professional championships of
Australia would be £2, please—cash, too ;
none of your fiduciary currency. However,
the Australian Golf Council melted, and there
will be. a 50 per cent, cut in each case.
Entrance for the foursomes will remain at
the original figure, 10s. per player. The
meeting opens on the Australian club links
at Kensington (N.S.W.) on August 24.
“Iconoclast'’: Hitherto about the only
method of judging the distances driven by
the ordinary golfer is to take his word for
them, for obvious reasons an unsatisfactory-
method. A machine for this purpose has
now come on the market; it is designed
on the lines of the old sideshow “try-your-
strength” gadgets which registered the power
of a wallop on an upright scale. The ball
is teed on a metal arm, and when the golfer-
drives off the impulse is mechanically con-
veyed to a pointer which indicates the dis-
tance probably driven. A system of lights
also shows whether the shot has been sliced
or hooked. All that seems necessary for
perfection is a phonograph attachment which
remarks: “A topping shot, eh?” “In the
blanky rough again !” or other conventional
golf comments.
“Divot Digger”: Walter Hagen, who has
had rather a lean year, got into the lime-
light and the cash again the other day when
he lifted the Canadian open championship
at Toronto. He had to go all out, however,
for Percy A.liss, of England, tied with him
and was beaten by only a stroke in the play
offi Aliss, who put in some years in Berlin
as a golf professional and won the Deutsclier
championship on several occasions, would not
have been considered as a match for Walter
a couple of years ago. Nevertheless such
crackerjacks as Tommy Armour, open cham-
pion of Britain this year and professional
champ, of the States for 1930, and Johnny
Farrell, another Yank topnotclier, finished
down the course, so the going must have been
stiff.
-r v v '<•
“Hoylake”: Cyril Tolley, ex-amateur
champion of Britain, has never been famed
in golf as a sticker, brilliant as he is on
many occasions. In law he seems to pack a
different mentality, for the cable states that
lie has at last won his case against a choco-
late-manufacturing firm which used a cari-
cature of him as an advertisement. Tolley
originally sued the firm for libel, since he
thought the publication reflected on his
amateur status, and got a verdict for £IOOO.
The matter was taken to the House of
Lords. Here anew trial was ordered, and
at this the indignant golfer was awarded
£SOO. H'ow he will find his bank balance
when the costs have been settled it is impos-
sible to say, but since he is a London stock- .
broker he is, presumably, able to afford the
luxury of long-drawn-out litigation, expen-
sive as it is.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: Little'has been heard of Wizard
Smith lately, but it is reported that the Aus-
tralian speed driver will give the big car that,
he and Don Harkness have been building in
Sydney a spin on the M.L. Ninety-mile
Beach in October. Maoriland opinion is all
against the month chosen, ideal conditions not
existing until January, February and March.
H. Butcher, chairman of the M.L. Automobile
Club, is strongly against the October attempt,
and since the Australians have a formidable
record to beat in Malcolm Campbell’s 245.73
m.p.h., it is up to them to hearken to the
wisdom of the men on the spot.
# * * *
“Fitzeray”: The Vic. party about to set
out for Britain via Darwin and the places
in between includes two women who, in
1928, put up a record run from Fremantle
to Adelaide (1750 miles in 58 hours), Misses
Howell and Robertson. Apart from the trip
itself the objective is participation in the
next Monte Carlo rally, which takes place
in January. The «<>,.« will comply in all
respects with the requirements of the famous
European race, special bodies having been
designed in Australia. The party, leaving
on August 15, has so fixed its schedule that
Cairo will be reached in time to ship from
Alexandria in ample time for the start of
the Bally.
“Differential”: The British motor press
has been arguing whether driver or passenger
most enjoys motoring. I vote for the passenger,
concentrating, not on the humans, but the
dogs, who are, in my opinion, the most pas-
sionate devotees of speeding. Half a dozen
of my canine acquaintances are such motor
fiends that the sight of a car being brought
out of the garage induces as much excitement
as the production of a shotgun used to do
among four-legged friends of an earlier day.
I have in mind one old bulldog in particular
whose pet possie is on the running-board of a
car driven by a pukka speedster. Rain, hail,
wind or dust has as yet failed to wipe the
capacious smile off his face when the boss
is hitting her up to 60 m.p.h., or to induce
the shortening of the half-yard or so of
crimson tongue that flies on the breeze like
an oriflamme.
Miscellaneous
“Blade Sight”: An unparalleled perform-
ance was put up last week when W. J.
Fulton won the King’s Prize at Bisley for
the third time. His first win was in 1912,
and the second 14 years later. His dad,
with whom the winner runs an armorer’s-
sliop at Bisley, won the coveted trophy—
then “The Queen’s” —in 1888. Fulton is
well remembered among riflemen in Aus-
tralia, for he was one of the leading lights
of the English team which shot here in 1907.
In addition to his winning treble, Fulton
has twice been runner-up.
*•* V
“Long Rest”: Lee and Steeples, the two
young Englishmen recently competing for
the Empire amateur billiards championship
in Sydney, are mightily pleased that the hand-
some Walker Cup has come England’s Way
for the first time since the tourney was
inaugurated in 1927. when A. Pryor won
for South Africa, to lose later to Australian
Leslie Hayes. Both the Englishmen, especi-
ally Steeples, the _ actual winner, showed
form closely bordering on that of high-class
professionals and far ahead of anything Aus-
tralia has yet seen in the way of amateur
billiards.
“Bias”: The bowlers of Windsor (M.S.W.)
have been stirred from their immemorial calm
by a dastardly outrage. Recently the inhabi-
tants of that quiet backwater completed anew
bowling-green which was the apple of the
town’s eye, so to speak. Early the other
morning shrill screams from the greenkeeper
brought the members of the club hotfoot to
the green. The custodian was too over-
whelmed to speak, but pointed with shaking
fingers to his cherished charge, now much
more like a Gruyere cheese than a bowling-
green. Some wretch had got busy in the
night with a spade and dug some 20 holes
in the sacred turf. Fortunately, the pubs
had opened and the nerve-shattered spec-
tators were able to fortify themselves on
their way back to their homes.
“Splash”: Helen Madison, the American
swimmerette, has been breaking things up
again. This time it was the world’s record
for 1500 metres (about 1640 yards), which
she reeled off in 23min. 17 l-ssec., taking
22 2-ssec. off the previous best by Marie.
Norelius, now a professional. This makes
the fair Helen’s sixth world’s record, the
others being for the 100 metres and the 220,
300, 440 and 500 yards.
“Aigburth”: E. A. McDonald has an-
nounced the finish of a great cricket career
as far as the higher flights of the game are
concerned. A couple of seasons ago he suf-
fered a bad strain, and this has made three-
day matches too much for him. He leaves
the Lancashire side after nine years of
splendid service, in which his bowling was
the main factor in lifting the Red Rose
side to the county premiership and keeping it
there for several seasons, to play with Bacup
League Club, where South Australian A. J.
Richardson has also found a perch. The
Tasmanian-Victorian was certainly one of the
greatest bowlers Australia has produced, and
lie was as clever with the medium stuff as
with the expresses—a very rare accomplish-
ment.
“Spike”: South Australia has lost an
athlete under unusual circumstances. He is
T. A. Kullburg, who has been recalled to
his native Finland to undergo his period of
military service. Kullburg has been in S.A.
for the last couple of years, and has done a
lot to raise the standard of the field-games
section of athletics, at which he is a cham-
pion. The youngster goes home as a sea-
man on the sailing-ship Ilougomont, but is
returning to S.A. when his 18 months of
military training has expired.
❖ ❖ w *
“Shell”: It is more than likely that the
world’s champion professional sculler, Ted
Phelps, will come to Australia to defend his
title next year, if the cash can be got
together. Ex-champion George Towns has
written him from Sydney that a match
for £SOO or £IOOO a side can be arranged,
with £2OO for travelling expenses. The
Phelps family do not consider the latter sum
large enough, and negotiations are proceed-
ing. The question of who will be Phelps’s
opponent has not been settled. The likeliest
man in sight is Alt' Burns, of the Richmond
River (N.S.W.). Though a lightweight—
lOst. 131 b.—he is the best professional in
Australia to-day, and has defeated all his
challengers.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Lennon's Hotel
BRISBANE
The Centre of Queenslands
Dislinguished Social Life
Professor John Anderson, who was
"severely censured” by the Senate for saying
things about loyalty, patriotism, religion and
politics which a professor isn’t expected to
say, had to deliver an address before the
’Varsity Science Society the same evening.
The reception he got almost overpowered
him: such a pathetic little stripling he
seemed, so frail, so consumed by the fires of
the zealot. He took the part of Philosophy
in a double-barrelled evening, and when his
share of the proceedings was over begged to
be allowed to fade away.
This has been a record winter for
the consumption of wool in and around
the city. Not even during war-time was
the click of the needle louder in the land.
Indeed, the young sheepgrower must be grati-
fied to note that, what with her woolly
scarves and berets and hand-knitted frocks,
every second girl looks like a woolbuyer.
Even the approach of spring finds no abate-
ment of the demand for wools. Undies
in the lacy stitches are featherweight, and
fashion declares that the really knutty
bathing-suit on the summer beaches will be
hand-knitted.
Commodore Holbrook’s swept and bunting-
garnished Canberra, standing off Farm Cove,
was the setting for the week’s brightest party
to the Chileans. The new Commodore has, like
Shore’s wife, a merry eye and a passing
pleasing tongue. At least the girls seemed
to think so, for the best brand of smiles
wreathed their lips as they greeted and fare-
welled him. His skin is so clean and pink
it looks as though it had been holystoned,
and he’s, if possible, a better host than
Rear-Admiral Evans. Smart young naval
officers with telescopes tucked under their
arms helped him keep the gangway. There
was such a profusion of gilt-edged young
sea lords that they could have been
issued two apiece to the girls; and when you
got tired of gazing at, or through, the people
you met everywhere, you struggled to say
a few words to the visitors, most of whom
display thick, dark eyelashes and small hands.
Animation illustrated with hundred-words-a-
minute hands, Captain Luis Alvarez stood in
a wash of sunlight and talked to the Lus-
cornbe Newmans. Mrs. Ernest Brookes
framed her dazzling complexion in a high
collar of snow-white shorn lamb. Susan
Spencer suggested a crimson rambler in her
very red outfit. The Town-clerk Roy
H’endys were among the early-comers, and
later the Ludmayor Jacksons climbed the
dizzy heights of the companion way. The
vice-regals were among the invited and the
unavoidably absent. Chile’s Consul-General
Dundas Smith, his wife and daughters were
in the public eye, Ethel wearing a black
astrachan muff to go with her black hat.
Morna MacCormick was among the well-
groomed ; and Margaret Honey and Wendy
Palmer were two young things who swung
an active jazz-foot. Mrs. Heritage wore a
shoulder fur of lush growth ; Captain Far-
quhar-Smith and his wife were important
people, and Doctor R. A. Eakin’s wife was
one of the best-turned-out women aboard.
Japan’s Consul-General and his wife, the F.
Daniells, the Clifford Hays, Mary Armitage
and the popular Feakes couple were among
the notables.
A visit to the bakehouse, where literally
thousands of sweet-smelling crusty loaves
were being shelved by fresh-cheeked bakers
in snowy caps, an inspection of the kitchens
and a tour of the decks were politely proffered
by the numerous budding admirals to the
visitor. In the kitchens there were gleaming
coppers in which soup is brewed, enormous
vessels for water for tea and cocoa, roaring
oil-fuelled stoves, and ovens which do their
baking by grace of steam. Shining tiles
and spotless woodwork smote the eye on
every side, and the most speckless things on
the horizon were the cooks.
The urbane Consul-General for Chile, R.
Dundas Smith, has been showing the best
side of our city to the men of the training
ship now moored at the Quay. Compara-
tively small though the craft is, a life-size
Chilean flag floats proudly from her prow.
This is red, white and blue, blazoned with
a white star. Mr. Dundas Smith explains
that the white represents the snow of the
Andes and the purity of the nation’s ideals,
the red typifies the blood that every true
Chilean patriot is willing to shed in defence
of his country, the blue stands for the sky
and the star is the symbol of guidance. It
sounds very poetic.
The first big private, party for the visitors
was given on the Nieuw Zeeland by courtesy
of the Royal Packet Co. Mr. and Mrs. R.
Dundas Smith and Bakker.
gave the guests the freedom of the boat. Cap-
tain Luis Alvarez and ten of the senior officers
came to the dance, and presently the gentle-
men from Chile were teaching their Aus-
tralian partners the smooth slow steps of
the tango. Mrs. Dundas Smith wore sleek
black satins and a filmy black coat Of the
right cut. Her daughters Margaret and
Ethel were both sheathed in black velvet.
Margaret sported the cream lace mittens of
the moment; Ethel’s frock had an unusual
lace yoke and elbow-length sleeves. The John
Dundas Smiths also enjoyed a night out, she
in a thistledown arrangement of tulle and
satin. Then, of course, the Lammers couple
(he’s Royal Packet’s assistant general man-
ager) were in the picture. Mrs. Lammers
is a good frocker and was graceful
in parchment satin and 1 a gold satin
wrap. The Consul-General for the Nether-
lands was among the dancers, and among the
visiting officers the contrast of such old Irish
and Spanish names as Molyneux and Gon-
salez caught the imagination.
Pretty Ruth Cohen, who was such a force
in the Uni. Glee Club a year or so ago, has
just added an L.A.B. to her still-shining
B.A. Music has always proved a siren
to Ruth and at one time threatened to lure
her altogether from her other studies; how-
ever, she is now on the staff of the High
School at Lismore, her home town. She
reports that things in “the richest dairying
district of Australia” go on in the same way
as before the depression—plenty of bridge,
dancing and golf.
Dorothea Mackcllar has got together quite
a company of P.E.N. members, and the first
dinner of the Sydney branch of this inter-
national writing brotherhood will take place
at the Mascot in Hunter-street on August 7.
The Mascot is a suitable lair for scribes, for
if is run by Bertram Stevens’s widow, and
Bertram was one of Sydney’s early antholo-
gists and ; a great publicity man for the Aus-
tralian writer.
The Rawson Institute has been one of the
favorite meeting places of the lads of the
General Baquedano. Padre T. Hardy, who
is in charge of the Institute, came direct to
Sydney from about 20 years’ service in Val-
paraiso, and consequently speaks Spanish
like a native, or like several natives, for
there’s not a dialect he doesn’t seem to roil
out in the most fluent manner. The girls of
the different guilds, who give much of their
leisure to arranging entertainments for the
men below the quarter-deck, staged a dance
and a concert. They found the men, although
many of them are square of build, extremely
good dancers, so that all went well even
though conversation was limited. The
absence of a mandoline prevented four of
the boys from Chile from presenting a dance
called “the Quaker.” That not one mando-
line could be found on the premises seemed
to stagger them. But our ferries dimpling
a track across the Harbor at night make up
for even a shortage of their beloved instru-
ment.
The frivols of the week have centred
in the Chilean naval training ship, and
the subject of this picture has been the out-
standing host-
ess. She is
Mrs. R. Dun-
das Smith,
wife of the
Consul - Gen-
eral for Chile
—“Coal Tar”
Smith his
friends and
neighbors have
named hi m,
from a com-
modify he
trades in five
and a half
days of the
week. Mrs.
Dundas Smith
is a tall, slight
Englishwoman
whose home
and garden at
Mosman ab-
sorb her days.
Two daughters, Ethel and Margaret, have
been helping their mother through the over-
time rush of social activities, and a nice-
looking daughter-in-law has done her bit, too.
A box of hankies to each woman guest was
the appropriate midwinter gift issued by the
committee of the N. S. Wales Masonic
Club’s Ball. This is the third year the club
has bubbled into jazz, and with one thing
and another the sparkling quality was main-
tained. The flower decorations were like a
choral outburst to spring ; violets, wallflowers
and stocks predominated. There was a pro-
fusion of balloons, jazz-caps and quaint name
cards, and the frocking was in the de luxe
class. Mrs. Askey, wife of the president, dis-
played well-cut burgundy laces. Dr. F. A.
Maguire and Mrs. Maguire were in the
official party, as were the E. Dyson Austens,
the G. M. Chambers couple and Mr. and Mrs.
W. H. Hellings. H. Lesnie was the treas-
urer and H. J Sneddon the secretary of
the gay little dance, which fluttered in the
club premises in Castlereagh-street.
Edmond Samuels organised the Goodwill
Ball, which filled the Wentworth, with
animation and a strange mixture of the
Spanish and English tongues. Prince Alfred’s
and the Limbless Soldiers share the substan-
tial profits. The great attraction for the very
young dancer was the presence of the Chilean
officers, and bright-eyed girls whose deli-
cate-hued chiffons fluttered like a garden of
sweet-peas found the visitors as eager to
please as a group of children. Two of them
performed a sort of impassioned clog-dance
to the beat of the white-clad orchestra, who
were gypsy-like with their red neckerchiefs
and sashes. Later, another pair, Engineer-
Commander Virgilo and Midshipman Oxley,
played and sang fervently, finishing up with
“O Sole Mio.” The singing of the Chilean
National Anthem with its long-drawn-out
notes (rather like bagpipe music) was a
stirring event. Consul-General Dundas Smith,
with his wife, entertained the representatives
of Prince Alfred’s, and the Limbless Soldiers’
Association; among these were Mr. and
Mrs. C. A. Cotton and Beryl Brown, Mr. and
Mrs. O. Byers and Mrs. W. J. White. Ethel
and Margaret Dundas Smith were cheery
hostesses at another table. Marjorie Ward
wore much-flounced black taffetas, the fair
Mrs. Harold Vale danced smoothly with'the
visitors, and Lynette Clonan was like a dear
little Quakeress in her dove-grey frock with
its snowy fichu. The room blazed with red,
white and blue.
The North Shore line is very proud of
the girl in this picture. She is Odette
Lefebvre, winner of the women’s golf cham-
pi o nship of
New South
Wales in the
recent hard
fight at Rose
Bay. Odette
has been play-
ing golf only
18 months,
but in that
time she has
put in solid
practice on the
Killara links.
A p p r o a ches
and putting
are the two
points of the
game to which
this bright-
eyed, dark-
haired girl
gives her clos-
est attention.
The new cham-
pion is a daughter of the well-known
woolbuyer. Before her schooldays at Abbots-
leigh in Wahroonga, and Frensham at Mitta-
gong, she had been as a small child at school
in France, England and South Africa. Odette
is also a keen . tennis-player. This photo-
graph is by Monte Luke.
One of the budding officers on the General
Baquedano is named Edmundo Molyneux, and
Orookwell (N.S.W.) was his father’s native
heath. A good-looking lad with suave manners,
Edmundo can scarcely speak his father’s
tongue. One of the Consul-General’s show
pieces is to say: “Now, Mr. Molyneux, what
is Australia?” And Edmundo, smiling like
a seraph, replies in careful English, “It .is
the land of my father.” He has already
linked up with aunts and relations, and a
group of pretty Irish girl cousins came to
town specially for the dance at the Went-
worth.
Mrs. Vivers seems fated to be before the
public gaze. Following on her successful
divorce action against Dr. Vivers, she is now
about to defend her claim to a string of
pearls, got at Gompers, in Monte Carlo, when
the pair were on their honeymoon. The doctor
claims that the pearls were bought by him
as an investment, and now he wants them
back. They are insured for £BOOO. Some
years ago, while Mrs. Vivers was waiting
for a Manly boat to bring her back to the
city, the precious string broke, and one pearl
was lost. Rumor at the time said that this
one gem alone was worth £5OO. But the
latest blow of fate to one of Sydney’s best-
looking women is that she is listed for £3300
among the unsecured creditors of Mrs.
Ernest Edols, of Darling Point.
The new Matson liner s.s. Mariposa, which
will probably enter the Heads in February
next year, is an Australian by faith if not
by works. She was launched two or three
days ago at Fore River, Mass., U.S.A., when
Mrs. Wallace M. Alexander broke a bottle
containing water from Port Jackson over the
bow of the ship. The Mariposa is the first
of a trio of modern super-liners being built
for the America-Australia run.
The most-talked-of wedding during the
week-end was that of Bonnie Cramsie to
Norman Reading. St. Mark’s at Darling-
Point blazed with orange and gold poppies
for the event, and Canon Langley blessed
the vows. Parchment .satin, a filmy lace veil
and yellow roses were the high lights of
the bride’s outfit, while her two ’maids were
in apricot georgettes. Bride’s parents, the
J. B. Cramsies, had the usual reception in
their Elizabeth Bay home. Norman is the
only son of the Claude Readings, of Edge-
cliff. The new. home is Cootamundra way.
Sydney journalists, or, rather, the Insti-
tute of Journalists, had the Navy for guests
at its luncheon last week. Commodore Hol-
brook and Captain Farquhar-Smith repre-
sented the silent service, and there was the
usual company to drink its health in innocu-
ous white wine or iced water. The insti-
tute seems to be settling down into middle
age. There wasn’t one bubble of laughter
in the speeches. Indeed, the Commodore’s
effort was more of an article than a speech,
and, as for the befores and afters, you’d have
thought they were explaining Mark
Anthony’s first appearance in his oration
over the dead Cmsar.
Judging from Ascot, we will all be wearing
this summer the figured or flowered chiffons
with many frills and flounces and maybe the
large bustle bows. Muslins, organdies and
the finest linens, many of them punched
and punctured with the broderie Anglaise
designs, are steady favorites. Large straw
hats and picture-hats of broderie Anglaise,
sashes and the pale pink silk stocking are
among the fashion tips for our spring meet-
ings. White flowers bloom on the brims of the
best hats. One advance model seen last week
was of black pedal straw; the wide brim was
caught back buccaneer-wise at the right with
one white and one black gardenia, while at
the left it spread out into a shallow scuttle.
A note from Joan Holroyde in Paris dis-
closes that she and Norah are enjoying life,
though the latter has had a casualty with
an appendix. They are staying in a pension
just opposite the Luxembourg Gardens, which
is of all Paris the children’s park. It
amazes the Australian girls,. because there’s
practically no grass in it. A Russian com-
pany in a series of sketches, “L’Oiseau Bleu,”
captured the travellers’ fancy. The entertain-
ment was composed of a set of small scenes,
acted on the scale of a small picture. Every-
thing was sung in Russian, to very modern
music and amidst modern scenery; the
dressing, however, was about, the crinoline
period. One sketch, “Le Babillage au Samo-
var,” might suggest an idea to Sydney
amateurs. The curtain rises on a tray, the
centre of the tray lifts, and behold six
old-fashioned women sitting around a table
drinking tea. Joan is taking lessons in
cooking from a French chef, and these plus
her French studies and sightseeing keep her
busy.
A letter from Bananaland:—
At the second of the vice-regal garden parties
Lady Goodwin wore burgundy silk with a white
design and a cloche en suite, and white-fox furs.
Mrs. Campbell was in black with a green hat; the
Mayoress, in king-blue and black fur, with a black
felt hat; the Blair lady, in black with a scarlet
scarf and black tricorne hat; Miss O’Shea,
in cedarwood tweed and fitch furs; Sheila Logan,
in parrot-green. Mrs. A. H. Whittingham chose
beige with a black coat; Irene Longman, M.L.A.,
was in navy with a navy capeline.
The Repertory prize play, “In Beauty It Is
Finished,” by G. L. Dann, was staged for three
nights in His Miajesty’s. The part of Marion was
taken by Dulcie Scott, who is always excellent, and
Mrs. P. J. Symes gave a vivid portrait of the mother.
Mary Edmonds. Hilda Hastie took the part of
one of the most natural characters in the play,
Joyce, who goes to Brisbane to find her lover lias
married someone else. A string orchestra from the
Wilston State School played operatic and popular
gems. Barbara Sisley was the producer and Dr.
J. V. Duhig stage-managed.
At the annual meeting of the Queensland Press
Institute, Mrs. Young was elected the first woman
president. The lady was at one time head of the
“Courier’s” women’s section and lias long been pro-
minent in journalistic circles. She is connected with
the Technical College.
Lennons’ ballroom was decorated with colored
lights and many flags for the Anzac Ball. Pink
roses were in the vice-regal alcove, which rugs and
easy-chairs made cosy, and there was bridge in the
eastern lounge, against a background of roses. Sir
John and Lady Goodwin were accompanied by Colonel
and Mrs. N. A. H. Campbell. The Mayor and
Lady Mayoress had with them Dr. and Mrs. George
Middleton. ■ The Blair lady, Brigadier-General E.
M. Ralph and officers of the committee assisted Mrs;
Lorenzo in receiving the Governor’s party. Lady
Goodwin was in garnet-red satin fashioned with a
flared skirt, with which she wore a white-fox fur;
Mrs. Lorenzo was in black mariette, with a blue
flower; the Blair lady wore floral georgette; Mrs.
Green, black and diamente; Mrs. J. C. McFarlane,
ivory chiffon; Mrs. C. E. Sligo, green; Mrs. George
Mocatta, lupin-blue; Mrs. F. A. Hughes, apricot silk;
Mrs. L. C. Wilson, wine-colored mariette. The deb.
was Marjorie Sayle in ivory over pink, with pink
beb6 roses on the skirt. Norah Halford was in
leaf-green, Grace White in lupin-blue and Madge
Cullen in burnt rose.
After the Governor had opened Parliament, the
A. E. Moores had a tea party, amid wattle, boronia
and gum tips. The guests were Archbishop Sharp,
the Glasgow lady, Dean and Mrs. H. 11. Dixon, Dr.
and Mrs. Val Macdonald, the Crothers, the Percy
Shaws, Mrs. D. A. Cameron, Dr. W. N. Robertson,
Edward and Euston Moore. The State Treasurer and
Mrs. Barnes, the Sizers and R. M. Kings also enter-
tained, as did the Attorney-General and Mrs. Mac-
groarty.

Dressing at Moonee Valley on Saturday
followed winter lines. The wind was cold
arid dust-laden, and a deluge of rain fell just
as people were getting home. On the com-
mittee luncheon-tables, Iceland poppies and
wattle dripped petals and pollen on the
damask. Among the feminine racegoers were
the Chauvel lady, in brown and rust-colored
tweed coat with a brown felt hat, accom-
panied by her sister, Mrs. Bundoek. in beige
ensemble and matching millinery. Mrs. Alec

The Flying Corps Association, member-
ship of which is confined to those who saw

dore Williams did the honors with Mrs.
Williams, who wore wine-colored lace. Mrs.
S. Scrivenor’s goblin-blue frock was scat-
tered with silver sequins; Mrs. Kingsford-
Smith was in white with a tracery of silver

ance of Eileen Ilespe, who sported a powder-
blue frock with a sprinkling of beads, in
the ticket distribution.

The Newman College students’ dance at
St. Ivilda Plaza served as celebration
for the victory that afternoon of the

pionship of the Uni., vanquishing Ormond.
.Ymong the guests were Father Murphy,
Rector of Newman; Dr. Behan, Warden of

ette and lace blended brown hues and a
gleam of gold; and Enid Joske, principal of

Miss N. Egan, matron of the college, were
hostesses and received posies.
St. John’s, Toorak, was decked with pink
and white heath when Joan, elder daughter
of the Harold Newbigins, of Burwood,
became Mrs. Walter Macpherson. White
satin that went on its flared way into two
pointed trains was worn by the bride, whose
tulle veil was attached to a semi-wreath of
orange-buds. In hydrangea-blue chiffon with
coats and hats of deeper tint of velvet, and
carrying great bouquets of rose-pink camel-
lias, Patricia Newbigin, sister of the leading
lady, and her cousin, Betty Mills, were

of South Yarra. There were rejoicings at
No. 9.
At the Grammar School chapel Harold

rejoicings at Lochfoyne, Toorak.
Violet, second daughter of Mrs. N. L.
Wood, of St. Kilda, exchanged vows with

somes alone totalled close on 300. The affair,
which included bazaar stalls and was favored
by fine weather, was engineered by associates
of the club, led by their captain, Helen
Leonard, and hon. sec., Mrs. W. E. Palmer,
In “Patience,” revived at the Royal on
Saturday, Dorothy Gill, as Lady Jane, looked
imposing in sage-green draperies on which
was embroidered in black and dull red a
design of birds and flowers. A gold crown
and armlets linked to bracelets by chains
were accessories. Brilliant color was fur-
nished by the gorgeous uniforms of the
dragoons and the Grecian robes of the 20
lovesick maidens who sighed and chased
Bunthorne. Marie Bremner, as Patience, wore
the traditional trappings of the comic-opera
milkmaid, with a flowered polonaise and a
garland of poppies and cornflowers round her
shady hat. In the first-night audience were
Joseph Bislop and his wife and daughter,
Robert Best and his lady, the Charlie Taits,
Mrs. Geoffrey Syrne, Airs. Godfrey, Mrs.
Stuart Brunton, Dr. R. Strong and Mrs. Allen
Robertson. Mrs. Charles Wenman was of
the many wrapped in white fur coats, which
are all the rage. A new version was woru
by a fair-haired miss in the stalls —a diminu-
tive jacket in Spanish bolero mode that
topped a frock all white chiffon frills.

end of the year.
Two women passengers on a recently-
arrived liner from London gave the ship a
thrill—or thought they did—by adopting
pyjama-suit attire for both day and evening
wear. These garments were of the jumper-
and-trousers order, the pants being bell-
bottomed. On their daily deck patrol
one wore navy blue jersey cloth pants
with a top part of striped navy and white;
the other sported a paler blue with white
spots. For dinner gorgeous two- or three-
piece garments of satin were displayed.
A colonist who had reached her 91st year,
Mrs. Jessie Cuthbertson, passed out at her
home, Toorak, last week. With her parents,
Mr. and Mrs. James Watson, she arrived in
Victoria in ’49, her father taking up land in
the Pentland Hills and later at Bacchus
Marsh. She was the mother of R. M. Cuth-
bertson, secretary of the Findon Harriers, of

T. Gay and their daughter Henrietta, J. G.
Cornell, M. Francis and N. Karagheusian.
There were real French newspapers, maga-
zines and books on the railway-station stall
in one scene, and beautiful posters of Con-
tinental travel were pasted up. The play
figures in the Vic. leaving examination this
year.
The smile belongs to Mrs. J. W. Leekie,
who under her maiden name, Hattie Knight,
recently pub-
lished a book
of essays
under the title
“Candor and
Cant.” Her
husband was a

Westralia’s note:—
The Dorothy Brunton co. must "have got- a thrill
from the opening night of "Dearest Enemy.” It tvas
two years since musical comedy had been produced
in His Majesty’s and the . theatre was packed with
diamonds and white shirtfronts, Mrs. Doy. Forrest,
Mrs. Fred Piesse, the Roy Mitchell couple, Mrs.
Meares, Mrs. Arthur Francis (in white; with a jet
necklace) and Kittle Gillies..were first-nighters. Miss
Brunton made the usual speech about the park and
about how all her co. just loved to be back again.
The Y.A.L. drummers and buglers, wearing white
uniforms and gold-lined violet coats, opened the
league’s ball with a spirited march.,and later .sounded
a come-to-supper call. Mrs. Simons, mother of the
league’s J. J., beamed her patronage in black geor-
gettes. Betty Davies wore cornflower-blue; Billie;
Atkinson carried her sweet smile above pearl-pink
chiffons; cream satin and laces clad Sj'lyia George;
Doreen Sheridan chose her favorite black; Ngaere
Purser rustled buttercup taffetas patterned with
orangy flowers; Mrs. Bantoek was a golden flash of
beaded lame ; Alice Biggs was in rainbow-pink; the
hip-line of Betty Goff’s carnation taffetas glistened
with dewdrop embossings, and royal blue was Nessie
Horgan’s choice.
Aero Club members were at home to their friends
in the Karrakatta Club on a recent evening. Supper
in the wattle-decked winter garden was an interlude
between dances in the main hall. The club’s presi-
dent, C. P. Smith, brought his better half in
diamente-sprinkled oyster chiffons cut with a fluttery
bolero effect. Jean Moullin flew black silk laces;
Mollie Lloyd, in her oleander georgettes, was worthy
of a second glance; a dash of green brightened Noel
White’s black garb; Marjorie Howlett clad herself
with folds of scarlet laces; tangerine predominated
in Kathleen Moullin’s flowered chiffons ; velvet, green
as a lush meadow, was Gwen Male’s choice.
Never has the Repertory Club flourished so heartily
as it does in these days of salary cuts. At the last
social evening the overflow had standing room only
in the passage. There were four playlets in which
a number of new members made their debut, music
by Margaret Sharpe and Jean Norman, a few words
from the lips of the Rabbi, and supper.
The Cottesloe club’s new links at Swanbourne
opened with a flourish of trumpets when 208 players
drove down the first fairway and drank to the club’s
long life. At luncheon, the president, F. E. Win-
grove, exhibited the ball used by Sir Gerald Strick-
land at the opening of the old course 22 years ago.
A competitor in this competition of bygone days was
Scotch College’s head, P. C. Anderson, who was
present at the luncheon and still plays pennant golf
for the club. He was British open champion
for 1893.
Mrs. T. C*. Kitching radiated pleasantries and
sparkling diamonds when she hostessed a dance in
honor of Miss Winifred Kitching. The newly-fledged
one, wearing diamente shoulder straps to her gown
of blue moire, solicited the guests’ signatures for
her latch key, a model big enough for a giant’s front
door. Mrs. Kitching’s flowered chiffons ran to
amber shades; Lesley Everett’s black net was
appliqued with glao6 bands; white ninon over a
suggestion of shell-pink clad Gwen Francis; Dorothy
Bird wore pink taffetas and her sister Margaret a
tangerine medley; Joyce Burridge chose blue ; blonde
Yvonne Brinkley was in black velvets; Nancy and
Dorothy Forbes wore coffee laces and bottle-green
respectively. The Harmony Girls produced the
syncopation.
Gleanings from South Aus.: —
Adelaide’s amateur theatrical talent was displayed
to advantage in the musical comedy “Dutini” at the
Royal. The co. numbers just on 100, with the ballet
and chorus. (On the same night the Repertory
Theatre Hall produced “Many Waters” with a cast
of 36 in Australia Hall.) The scenes in “Dutini” are
laid in India ; consequently Justice Napier’s wife, who
designed the theatrical wardrobe for the pageant
“The Warrior,” had ample scope for arranging
Asiatic costumes. By general agreement “Dutini”
surpasses the previous efforts of Edith Ail'd, Tom
King and Jack Fewster.
The Conservatorium Opera Class will present
Purcell’s “King Arthur” at the Norwood Town Hall
on August 20 and 21 under the direction of H.
Winsloe Hall.
Brookmah Hall presented a brilliant sight for
tiie School of Mines’ students’ ball. There was an
overhead canopy of purple, scarlet and orange
streamers and a striking arrangement of electric
lights in the same shades.
Dr. A. M. Cudmore’s daughter Rosemary was
married last month at Whitmore, England, to her
cousin, R. G. D. Cavenagh-Mainwaring. The bride
wore a charming blue crepe-de-Chine toilette, and
a hat to match.
Mrs. Cyril Williams, of Singapore, with her small
daughter, has been on a visit to her mother, Mrs.
L. Wells, in Adelaide; they left by the Katoomba
en route for Asia.
Tassie sends a few lines
Enid Clare, second daughter of the B. A. J. Benja-
fields, and Rupert, son of Mrs. and the late Mr. R.
W. Hart, were made one at St. Oswald’s Church,
Trevallyn. The bride’s frock, of dead-white satin,
was almost covered, from the shoulders, by a train of
Limerick lace. The fine tulle veil was held in place
by a “halo” wreath of orange blossom. Joan Inglis
and Thelma Fowell ’maided in sunset-pink georgette,
with short shoulder capes and pink tulle bandeaux.
The bride’s parents welcomed the guests at, the
Virginia tearooms.
Leslie Laurier, who made our flesh creep as Count
Draeula, has settled in Launceston. His production
of “The Man from Toronto,” with a cast of local
amateurs, drew a crowded house at the Academy
Theatre. The setting and staging and acting were
good, and Ruth Gee in the. part of the fascinating-
widow, Lila Calthorpe, made a palpable hit. Half,
the pi'oceeds of the show go to the Queen Victoria
Hospital, the Baby Health Association and the
Ministering Children’s League.
The film “Windjammer,” founded on the work of
Alan Villiers and the ill-fated young Ronald Walker,
whose death is portrayed in one scene, drew large
crowds in the city where both young men spent so
touch of their lives. Villiers’s wife is a Hobart girl,
and Walker’s parents, now living on the mainland,
were once well known in Hobart. Villiers’s last book,
“Vanished Fleets,” is dedicated to E. H. Webster.
The E. H. Websters, of Graystanes, Sandy Bay, have
been notified that their son Hugh has been appointed
assistant lecturer and senior research scholar at the
University of Bristol, under Prof. Tyndall. Another
Tasmanian, Malcolm Urquhart, has a billet in the
physics department there.
A movement is on foot to dispense with our cum-
brous old double-decker trams. It will have the
support of all but the fresh air fiends who make
a boast of always travelling on the top, even in
midwinter.
Beverley, daughter of the AV. G. Bairds, Laun-
ceston, is shortly to venture on the sea of matri-
mony with Harold Barwick, Melbourne.

W. CHARNLEY’S
TALE OF THE OUNCE THAT WAS OVERLOOKED.
OLD BILL BATEMAN put down the
prospecting dish with a gasp. His
heart began to beat quickly while a
queer thrill of exhilaration swept over him.
No, it couldn't be. Yet it was—if it really
was. He sat crouched on his heels hesitat-
ing to put his luck to a final test. It might
be something else, a scrap of iron, a battered
nut off an old bolt, or even a spent bullet
shot into the old alluvial years ago.
And then again it might be gold. He 7 took
up the dish again and gave the dusty tailings
another whirl. Something obviously metallic
scraped across the bottom. He recognised
the sound, though it was a long time since
he had last heard it —the dull, sluggish
scrape of gold!
Blowing the tailings aside he picked the
nugget out. It was a nugget—a real nugget,
small, but solid gold. H‘e let it fall back into
the dish. It struck with a pleasant metallic
chink — : an ounce' if there was a
four pounds all in one lucky scoop! He
could have-laughed aloud in his joy. What
luck ; what glorious luck—it was .years since
he had had anything like it. There had
been a time, of course, when such a trifle
as an ounce slug would have been dropped
carelessly into the “poverty pot,”: but that
was long ago, a damned long time ago. The
days and the years were much nearer when
he had been content .to scrape out a few
pennyweights a week.
But now fortune had smiled again: an
ounce, a whole ounce—good pay for one
day’s work. He had had an idea that the
far corner of that old “paddock” might still
hold a scrap of virgin soil. It was where
the original diggers had stood their shaker;
the heaps of old tailings showed that. And
he was right—nothing like a man using his
head.
It was just a bare shovelful of soil that
lie found; but it had held an ounce.
An ounce; and £4 2s. 6d. was the price
of fine gold. He knew what lie would buy
with it. Two, things-he; had if yearned ; for?
ever since , the cold; weather began—a. nice,
thick overcoat , to .. keep, his; old bones from
rattling and .a big bottle :of whisky, -a-quart,,
so that a man might have a nip before" lie
turned into bed of a might.
! .Well,-he’d got them now.
He: weighed the nugget in his hand. It
felt heavy, fitting snugly into his palm; he
liked, the feel of it.
He must show it to the kid before he sold
it. The kid would be pleased to see it; he
was always interested in gold.
“Got any gold to-day, Mr. Bateman?” he
would ask.
Called him Mr. Bateman: good-mannered
kid. Him, Old Bill! No one else ever
called him Mister nowadays. Old Bill Bate-
man Avas his name—a dryhlower living ‘ on
the pension; his only home a rag bag-humpy,
built with a gimlet-wood frame.
Still it was nice to ; be called Mister if
only by a little boy—showed the kid had
a good bringing up and' had been taught
respect for age. Had a good mother .evi-
dently. He'- had no father. Old -Bill knew,
that —the kid'- had told ' him! “My, father.'
is dead and there’s only me and my mother
and Tilly and Jessie. My mother goes out
washing.”' Old Bill knew that, too; he had
seen her coming and going and at times hffcT
noticed lines full of white clothes hanging
in the widow’s back yard ; far more clothes
and better than a widow and her children
could own and wear. ,
Poor she ’ was, like himself. Marvellous,
though, how she kept her children so neat
and clean —the kid was always tidy evert
though his clothes were patched.
“We’re poor,” the kid would confess,
naively, “and when I get big enough I’m
going to find some gold.” .
Old Bill would grunt at that. “You look
for something else,” lie.would advise. “Learn
a trade.” •' ...
“But you get gold.” the kid would argue;
Bill would grin, at that—sometimes lie did :
a few grains that helped-to eke. out the
pension. ') • '
However, now he,had an ounce, a decent
speck, and he must let the kid have, a look
at it. . >
Where was lie, though? Queer, that he
hadn’t been around for a day or two. But
that was just like a kid—thev’d ask ever 1 '
day for a year if a man had any gold; and
then, just the day he had some, they wouldn’t
be about. - y
How long was it since he had seen the
kid, anyway? His recollection moved back
three days. Queer —because the kid used to
come across nearly 'every day- and watch him
digging, or rock his pld' shaker while he
shovelled in the gravel.
“I’m your mate. Mr. Bateman,” the kid
would say, pleased to think he could do a
man’s share.
Old Bill would grin “Right-o.” He hadn't
a mate, and the kid didn’t seem to have any
either; none to play with. It was a lonely
sort of place, Pennyweight Flat.
Well, he’d call in and see the kid and
show him the wonderful gold. He might be
sick. "• '•
Old Bill gathered up his pick and shovel
and tin dish and started "for home. Night
was coming and a. bleak wind was starting
to blow across the wide barren fiat. He
shivered. Ilis mind veered back to his over-
coat. He would get one—a good thick one
even if it cost three pounds.
■ Before reaching his own old humpy he
'deviated a little to call at the kid’s place.
It was a little wooden house the kid’s; mother
lived in : three roopis ; 'a cheap little place.
Hesitatingly Old Bill knocked* at tlie door —
now that' he was there it seemed almost a
ridiculous errand: to call just to show a
little-boy a tiny piece of gold.
The kid’s-mother answered his knock.
“The little boy,” Bill'explained; “He’s
always been anxious to see a nugget of gold,
and to-day; I found a little piece. L thought
he would have been around.”
The mother' nodded ; she, understood ; the
boy had made her the confidant of his dreams
and of Old Bill’s promise to show him a
real piece of gold.
“He’s sick,” she explained briefly.
Sick! Old Bill expected it.
“But you can see him .if you like,” she
added.
She led the old man into a bedroom, her
best bedroom obviously. The kid was lying
on the wide double bed, curiouslyflushed-
looking. and with a strange bright flight in
his eyes.
Old Bill felt jolted; he knew the symptoms.
“Why, lie’s real sick—ill,” he whispered to
the mother.
• “-Pneumonia,” she concurred dully. The
kid was-lively enough. “Hullo. Mr. Bateman.
Have you brought me some gold?”
But' there was a curious catch-up in his
voice—a shortness of breath that was
ominous.
Old 1 Bill had .almost .forgotten' the - gold.
“But you’re sick, sonny,” "he"said kindly,
as he showed the youngster his tiny' scrap
of treasure! “Have you had the doctor?”
Ilis eye swept the table in search of medi-
cine. “He’s not long been,” tlie mother tb'ld
him. “I’m going out soon to get some medi-
cine.”
Old Bill,looked at the-sick child—he was
obviously too'ill to be left alone.
“Maybe I could go arid get it for you,’’
he offered. '
She shook her head. “It would be* a" lot
of trouble for 'you.” . -
• He smiled' in‘bis grizzldd'old style. “Not
a bit. . You .certainly can’t leave the-boy
while 'you go.” ’ ! ; ';
The doctor’s prescription-lay. on the table,
and he picked it up.' - His eyes were rheumy,
but hecould still manage to read.; - There
was a chemist’s “‘scrip’.’ i and a list -of . other
stuff —brandy, antiphlogistine, cotton-wool;
It would cost - something, that ' prescription
and the extras. -- - ; • - A.
The. mother held out : hen hand for;; the
paper.’ "I’m afraid I .can’t 1 let :ypu; go, .-Mr;
Bateman,”, she (explained ;Aamely. 1 “You see,
I have very little money, and I :thought that
perhaps I would; have;to ask. fpr;credit.”_, ; t
Credit! So that was it!. But tile brandy
—where would she get: that on credit ?<; ;H.e
knew pubs and publicans. He;.could picture ’
her begging—explaining) at the j side wicket
what she wanted it for—a , wholebottle;
while all ;the loafers in the bay- gaped*i.at
her. And the barman’s final; refusal along
with his knowing suggestion of having-heard
that yarn before. Did shb .know' what'she
was - going; qutj to' face, begging brandy , for
her sick child on- a' deadbeat .mining-field
where beer 'hummers, and r- spongers were
chronic! ’' - ' - "
He placed the paper in liis pocket. “I’ll
get this stuff for you, Mrs. Larsen. You
stop home and mind .the; boy.’’ .
She offered him a couple, of shillings.;. all
she had, but .he waved; it aside. r. -
“I have enough money; pay me some other
time.” ;■ '
Out in the bleak wind-. Old Bill buttoned
his thin coat : sliiveringly. . It was', cold.
Damned cold ! ' - The night had - closed . in ;
shops were shut, all . except the . chemisUs
and the pub. He must, sell his gold-first; The
bank was the proper place, but there ,was ,a
storekeeper who would oblige him. The
store happened to be still open—casual gold-
fields style—and the storekeper produced a
pair of gold scales. “An ounce to the grain,”
was liis verdict as the beam tilted. ;
With four notes’ and-some, odd silver Old
Bill hastened to the chemist’s. “This stuff
is going to cost something,” remarked' the
man of drugs, looking doubtfully at his
customer’s tattered clothes. “Looks like a
pneumonia case, so you’ll need a large tin
of' antiplilo. and a roll of cotton-wool,
enough to wrap the patient right around.”
Old Bill the information for a'
moment—he could see his, overcoat;? going.*- s
“How much will it take to cover the lot?”!
The chemist ma.de a calculation. “Well,
there’s, two‘scrips to,make up,’one to take
and one for inhaling—that’ll be six shillings.
And a large tin of anti phlo.—pays you better
to take a large tin at the start; maybe you’ll
need two before you’re done—thatill cost 5 a
guinea. Then the roll of cotton-wool, that’ll
be half a crown. And by rights you need
a yard, of oiled| silk to go outside to keep
the 1 heat and‘moisture in.”
Old, Bill placed two of his precious pounds
on the counter. 1 “Fill up the list. Mister;
I guess that’ll cover it.”
"At‘.the hotel Burke, the publican, greeted
the: tattered dryblower doubtfully-—be might
have some mondy or again he might merely
want “a bit of strap.”
“A bottle of your best hospital brandy,” a
large bottle.” 1 . '
Burke gasped; “Cost*you!twenty-two'- and
six. Who’.s'paying for_it?” ,
Old Bill slapped- the-money*on- the counter.
Burke grunted apologetically." •'“Yoir
blokes trick-.'me .at times pu you - come - in.
dressed, like T' diinho what and order stuff
like, the Prince of Wales.”
One lonely pound and some oddments of
silver, rested .in Old Bill’s pocket as lie left
the hotel. “Hell!” he thought. “Medicine
and such stuff- cost a power of money: where
was Ills overcoat now!”,
Still there he was; the kid was his mate,
and he had done as .much for a mate before
—more, in fact shared his last pint of
water when water meant life, away back
on the blistering Siberia ,* track.
The boy was babbling-' when he got back,
babbling in the delirium which clutches even
a sick child. It was a good job his mother
hadn’t left him. .
With a strange tenderness the grizzled,
dusty-whiskered old man helped the agitated
mother to prepare the big chest-wide plaster
and put it on. “It goes this way, the
chemist told me, and the cotton-wool and
oiled, silk go right around.”
Then came the medicine, and after an
interval. a spoonful of brandy. Under this
treatment thehbtiy grew easier and sank into
a:troubled*sleep,".
':“No'w : 'yQu’d ; -better 4go .and lie down while
I watch,” 1 Bill a'dviscd*'the;weary mother.
' „ Too" tired'to arikke--even a*‘pretended pro-
test; -she' crept J into: the * other room beside
her two" little daughters and-fell asleep.
.Left alone’ Old Bill fell;to- considering the
remaining ; pound—it .represented his pro-
mised,,bottlc'of whisky.; . Would it have; to
. go,;along with"tlte overcoat? It looked like
„ it. Rough luck —but what did his paltry
wants compare" with the needs of the sick
eliild ; beside' him ! Indeed, how would the
child have fared if, he, Old Bill, hadn’t hap-
pened to strike that scrap of gold? It looked
almost as if" it had' been sent to him so that
he could give the help that was needed.
Stillyit was the last quid. He fumbled the
note-'lovingly.'' It felt crisp to his fingers,
and it' had 1 ;a pleasant smell. Whisky was
pleasant stuff,-too; it warmed an old man’s
body. , But there were other things that
pound would buy-:—things the kid would need,
; since it'would be weeks before the mother
would ’be able v to go out working again.
There might even be that, extra-tin of anti-
phlo. the. chemist had spoken of. Rolling
the note up small ‘he ■ liid it under a cup
where it would be found after he had gone.
Close on daybreak the mother awoke, and,
full of agitation lest she had overslept, came
to relieve the old man from his vigil.
' “Your.kindness,-is'beyond my thanks, Mr.
Bateman*’- 'she •murmured, gratefully.
“Oh, it ain’t much,” he demurred. “You
see me and the boy was sort of mates, and
it’s a poor man that can’t stand by his
mate.” . - '
She opened'the door to let him out. The
bleak'-’wind' -was ■ still-'blowing, only colder,
and-it! whipped ; in iat fllnP-dpor like a gust
from an-iceberg. Old Bill-shivered. It was

Suddenly a-'thought, struck the woman.
“Wait a moment,'Mr. Bateman.: It’s too
cold for you to face.” ■ From a corner ward-
robe she produced an overcoat.
“It belonged to my husband, and I’ve
been keeping* it for! Jimmy,; but long before
lie’s. big enough to wear it the moths will
have it. Put it on and keep it just as—
just as a small return.”
Old Bill didn’t refuse. He snuggled into
the big overcoat. It felt thick and warm;
a better one probably than he could have
bought with, the whole four pounds. He
buttoned it up tight, and the bleak wind
blew round-but. nqt through him.
Trudging across the lonely flat to his camp

Here’s a recipe, given by a leading chemist, that
will enable people to make the best family cough
remedy, and at the same time save much money.
Everybody knows that a good cough and influenza
remedy consists of two main sections.
The first section is the undiluted medicinal ingredients; and the second is, of
course, the necessary water and sweetening. The preparation of the medicinal
ingredients requires trained knowledge, but the water and sweetening can be
added in the home just as easily as in the pharmacy. And you save a lot of
money by doing so. Now, prove these facts by trying this HEENZO recipe:
Into a jug put four tablespoonfuls of sugar, three of either treacle or honey, two
of vinegar, and a large breakfastcupful pf warm water. Stir till dissolved, and
when the syrup is quite cold pour into a large bottle, and then add a two-shilling
bottle of concentrated HEENZO, obtainable from your chemist or store. By
doing this you will have a family supply equal in quantity and superior in quality
to eight ordinary-sized bottles of the best ready mixed cough remedy that, if
purchased in the usual way, would cost up to £l. An outstanding feature about
HEENZO is the fact that it is a safe remedy for babies as well as adults, and over
12,000 people have written letters proclaiming it the best remedy they have ever
used for quickly banishing coughs, colds, croup, bronchitis and influenza.
