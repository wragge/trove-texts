The Other Third
Thousands of books are appearing
every year about the two most portentous
countries in the modern world—China
and Russia. Nearly all fail: because
the writers, though honest, are ignorant ;
because, though knowledgeable, they
are biased ; or because, while knowing
a good deal, and being free from strong
prejudices, they are constitutionally in-
capable of telling the whole truth about
anything. Pepys, Greville and one or
two more produced works which have
lived for no other reason than that they
were able to put down with very few
reservations what they saw and experi-
enced. Here are two books by women
which perform the same rare feat.
The Russian woman is gloomy,
gauche, misanthropic (though a lover of
mankind in general), contemptuous of
clothes, beauty, comfort and society ; the
willing slave of her father; a clumsy
writer, as he was. The American is gay,
observant, absorbed in parties, food and
luxury of all kinds, artily apprecia-
tive of China’s culture and traditions,
and a beautiful writer. Though the two
are so different, they achieve the same
triumph ; make you see into the hearts
of people who are as strange to two-
thirds of the human race as if they lived
on another planet.
A Divided Family
The Tragedy of Tolstoy, by Countess
Alexandra Tolstoy (Allen and Unwin ;
155.), covers the period between 1889
and Tolstoy’s death in 1910. It is doubt-
ful if any daughter ever wrote of her
mother with the stolid objectivity which
the Countess Alexandra applies to the
relationship of her mother with Tolstoy,
the family and their friends.
For the first half of her married life
Tolstoy’s wife seems to have been a saint.
Countess Alexandra recalls the arrival
of the family from the country for the
Moscow season —“a complete house-
hold: a pair of carriage-horses, and the
old coachman Emelyanych, a cow, a
waggon of hay and oats, barrels of salt
cucumbers and sauerkraut, great stores
of preserves.” The Countess Tolstoy had
a passion for society and a conventional
mind, but she remained unperturbed out-
wardly when her husband’s “dark” visi-
tors (i.e., Tolstoyans) called while she was
entertaining her fashionable friends, or
when he appeared “in his peasant half-
length coat and with his dog in the midst
of a ball.” She became desperately ill.
Mother bore her illness with infinite patience
and meekness. The more intense her physical
pain the more she softened and lightened. She
did not complain, did not lament her fate,
demanded nothing, and only said something
affectionate to everyone.
She changed when she got well. Her
determination to get Tolstoy’s diaries,
and force him to give her control of his
author’s rights, dates from this illness.
She nagged at him on the subject with
the vigor and venom of a slum shrew.
Threats and simulations of suicide be-
came everyday affairs.
She went to father’s study and began im-
ploring him to give her the key of the strong
box in which the diaries were to be kept. She
fell on her knees before him and sobbed.
Father refused and. to cut short the painful
scene, went down to the garden. As he walked
under the windows mother shouted to him from
upstairs. “Liovochka! I drank a bottle of
opium! ”
In the circumstances the famous flight
became inevitable ; by no other means
could the frail old man hope to avoid
being badgered to death. But he waited
too long, and he travelled under condi-
tions that would have killed many a
younger invalid. He was “in a second-
class carriage, filled with tobacco-smoke,
strange people around us,” on the even-
ing of October 31, when Dushan Petro-
vich, a devoted friend, took his tem-
perature. It was 100.6. They got him
off the train at the next station, and
made up a bed in the stationmaster’s
quarters. '
Every stage in the progress of the ill-
ness, and all the methods used to combat
it, are described
in careful detail;
and so are the
reactions to the
tragedy of the
writer, of mem-
bers of the family
and of the strangers who clustered about
the station entrances. A couple of
Czarist detectives provide a form of
comic relief : an earnest old priest asks
to be allowed to reconcile the dying man
to the Church ; Sonia Tolstoy arrives by
special train, eager to know if her hus-
band is aware that she tried to drown
herself; the doctors give injections, oxy-
gen, apply hot-water bottles. They were
still making injections on November 7,
and for the first time his wife had been
allowed in, talking and lamenting volubly
as usual; but he was unconscious, and
in a few seconds he died.
It is a wonderful story chiefly because
of its remorseless veracity. Countess
Alexandra shirks nothing that may help
to elucidate the mystery of her father’s
domestic troubles ; and, though she wor-
shipped him, the picture of his distraught
wife is sympathetic on the whole.
China from the Inside
The weakness of Nora Wain’s The
House of Exile (Angus and Robertson ;
7s. 6d.) is its avoidance of life’s uglier
aspects. But, after all, it is only one
writer in millions who can face all the
facts; even Casanova refrained from
mentioning what his profession was.
Her ancestor, J. S. Wain, of Philadelphia,
traded with one Lin Yan-Ken in the
eighteenth century, and she had the phe-
nomenal experience of being made a
daughter of affection in the House of Lin
about ten years ago. The Lins—the name
is fictitious—have been engineers, mer-
chants, landholders, people of conse-
quence generally in China for over a
thousand years. Canton is the head-
quarters of the family.
The Lins in Canton speak of the Lins resi-
dent in the House of Exile as “temporarily
from home.” But Lin Fu-yi came from
Canton in the Yuan dynasty six and a half
centuries ago.
In the Lin household in Hopei this
American girl lived as a Chinese until her
marriage to an English official. She casts
innumerable entrancing lights on the
customs of the Chinese upper classes.
The House of Exile accommodates be-
hind its grey wall, “six feet thick and
four times a man’s height,” 83 people,
whose courts surround the Hall of An-
cestors. All Chinese homes of this type
are built on the same lines, so that, just
as a Catholic, anywhere in the world,
can follow the Mass, a Chinese, imme-
diately he enters an important house,
knows where to find the abode of the
Oven God, the residence of the Family
Elder, and so on.
The death of the Elder of Wang, which
he had foreseen and for which full pre-
parations had been made, seems a
strangely sensible function by comparison
with the distracted passing of poor Tol-
stoy. The Chinese system of land tenure ;
its family organisation, which obviates
such situations as the one that divided
the Tolstoy family—these and a dozen
more conventions and institutions make
it clear why some Chinese look on
Westerners as barbarians.
Unfortunately Miss Wain has little use
for any color but rose. No Lin gets into
trouble with the police, is seduced, goes
bankrupt, or even so much as says a
harsh word to another Lin —-or, for that
matter, to anybody else. In such an
environment an emotional, jealous,
avaricious and altogether human creature
like Sonia Tolstoy would appear a
maniac. For all that. The House of Exile
reveals some absorbing facts about
Chinese people and their natures as well
as about Chinese manners and customs ;
and it has the feminine charm of some
Chinese works of art.

by “M.H.E.” (R.P. 20/9/’33), scores in
at least one respect. It doesn’t seem to
have a solitary example of that ghastly
facetiousness which runs all through the

Old At
Vitality comes this
simple way
THE unforgivable sin to-day is to be too
old.” Yet young women —men, too —find
themselves just “worn-out” when they
should be at the zenith of a happy, healthy
life.
You want to enjoy life. You want to let
others find you fit and vigorous. Yon don t
want to be an “always-ill” wife or an “ever-weak
husband.
Young men and women, finding capacity for
work or pleasure destroyed by constant down-
dragging pain, weakness, back-breaking body
pains, agony to move or turn, bad nights perhaps,
and serious worries such as bladder trouble; most
surely you should realise that the kidneys lie at the
seal of your trouble.
Rheumatism, too, “the illness with a hundred
symptoms”; starting perhaps with sharp twinges
of pain in the muscles, the trouble, if neglected,
will develop until every movement of the body
seems just sheer agony.
Joints swell and become stiff, muscles ache
and burn, the back seems almost ready to break—all day there is constant down-
dragging pain and at night the tortured nerves refuse to sink to sleep.
Modern science has conclusively proved that the cause of rheumatism lies in
the blood. Poisons, such as uric acid in excess, harmful bacteria and toxins, are
carried through the system. In the case of uric acid, the tiny razor-edged crystals
are deposited in joints, etc., which flash to the brain their pain-struck symbols of
distress.
Weak kidneys, what misery they cause. If they are not filtering and purifying
the system they are allowing uric acid and other poisons to accumulate. That
is why you have pain night and day. That is why you feel and look "too-old.”
It is no use doping the system with drugs, pick-me-ups or purgatives in the
hope of getting back new vigour, when the trouble lies within the system, through
faulty kidney action. There are thousands of men and women suffering daily
“untold agonies” because of kidney trouble in one form or another who could
end their trouble in a very simple way. The only possible means of doing this
is to cleanse the body of pain-giving poisons, and that is a function the kidneys
must carry out.
Years Roll {Back
It is the testimony of not one but thousands
of one-time sufferers which enables us to state that
if you will commence a course with a simple
straightforward remedy, De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills, your pain and weakness will be
ended.
It does not matter how long you have suffered
or what disappointments you may have had in the
past—get a bottle of De Witt’s Pills to-day and
start strengthening the kidneys, toning up your
nervous system and building once again the real
foundations of health.
Why forego the pleasures of life? Why
continue in constant nerve-destroying pain? Why
be weak and ailing?
If you persevere with this tried and trusted,
40-year-old remedy, you will find your old, tired,
“worn-out” feeling replaced by new vigour and
vitality. Your day’s work will be a pleasure and
your spare-time pleasures doubled. No more
sallow, spotty complexion, no more sleepless
nights, no more stabs in the back. No more
rheumatic pains, bad back, bladder troubles.
Try just one bottle of De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills and prove this. If within 24 hours
from the first dose you cannot see (from colour of
urine) that they have started their health action,
return the partly-used bottle to the manufacturers
and your money will be refunded in full.
This guaranteed remedy has been tried and trusted for over 40 years. It can
be taken by the very young, the weakest, the oldest and women at all times, with
confidence. No dangerous drugs or purgatives, but a scientific preparation that
will do you good from the very first dose.

an Everest of garrulous fatuity in the
case of some members of the Sitwell
family.
Sitwell, Sacheverell. .. .Recreations: Catching
that tara avis the London motor-omnibus,
listening-in and Mr. J. C. Squire.
Who’s Who in Australia has nothing
to approach that for asininity—so far.
The probable explanation is that it is
still so new that contributors hesitate to
take liberties with it. But the desire to
make the little ones laugh is universal,
and we may expect to see our celebrities
yielding to it in time.
The chief defects, as “M.H.E.” points
out, are the absence of names which
should be in, and the vast amount of
space given to some names which would
not appear in a work of the kind in Eng-
land or the U.S.A. Several sportsmen
give themselves even more rapturous
boosts than Don Bradman; but Colin
Stephen, chairman of the A.J.C., isn’t
heard from. Most of the best-known
N. S. Wales K.Cs. talk, but the leader
of the Bar, A. B. Shand, is silent. So are
practically all the untitled doctors. This,
of course, is not the editor’s fault. The
local branch of the B.M.A. is understood
to have instructed its members not to
give information about themselves
(though no such rule exists elsewhere),
and there are many public characters
who shun publicity.
A rule laid down by Douglas Sladen,
the first editor of the English “Who’s
Who,” was that each subject’s life-story
should be inserted practically as it was
supplied. This put the responsibility for
self-praise, errors about ages, suppres-
sions of facts and downright lies on the
subjects ; and, as everybody understood,
no harm was done.
Mr. Knox seems to have varied the
system. When we read that C. G. Mac-
artney was “at the height of his career
universally estimated as greatest batsman
in world” and so on, the reader suspects
the hand of Mr. Macartney, but when
Norman Lindsay’s recreations are given
as “modelling old ships (exquisite work)”
there is a disposition to credit the editor
with the tribute in brackets.
Anyhow, the Sladen scheme was essen-
tially bad, and it is largely responsible
for the fact that no one has ever put
“Who’s Who” in the class of “Debrett”
or the “Almanach de Gotha.”
These publications also apply for infor-
mation to those who are destined to
figure in them. But the details supplied
are checked. It is useless for some vain
old peer to give the date of his birth as
1885 ; down he goes b. 1863. Divorces,
re-divorces, family origins, etc., are all
published in ruthless detail, and the result
is a publication of historical accuracy.
It would be a big job to organise an
Australian “Who’s Who” on such lines,
but it should be worth the trouble.
There is no reason why any genuine cele-
brity should be given the option of not
appearing. It would be easy to get the
necessary information about recalcitrants,
but, in any event, once the situation was
realised there would be no recalcitrants.
All would be as helpful as members of
the peerage, baronetage and knightage
are to the editors of works like “De-
brett.” The list of names might be
doubled under this arrangement; on the
other hand, the editor and his colleagues
would be able to cut down the achieve-
ments of most of the others by more
than half.
J. D.
An Archives Department
When Lieut. M. Fontaine Maury,
U.S.N., was collecting material for his
monumental “Physical Geography of the
Sea” he struck a goldmine in the form
of a stack of old ships’ logbooks which
had been tossed out as lumber. Had
he arrived on the scene a little later
they would have been burned, and much
of the information which he used in his
book would have been lost.
All through history we have had simi-
lar lessons, and in quite recent times
stacks of potentially priceless Govern-
mental files, correspondence and records
have been burned in Australian States.
South Australia was the first to realise
the folly of destroying records before
they had been searched for information
likely to be of historical value. In
1920 the Archives Department of the
Public Library came into being, with a
special Government grant and a fire-
proof building. To it was taken every
important historical document in the pos-
session of the library, together with all
the surviving State departmental files of
the early days, Governors’ dispatches,
official correspondence and so on. In
1925 an Act was passed forbidding Gov-
ernment departments to destroy old
documents, records and letters before the
archivist had looked them over, and an
appeal was made to descendants of
pioneers in possession of old diaries let-
ters or business books to give them to
the Archives.
The response was gratifying. Old
diaries, ships’ logs, passenger lists, photo-
graphs, sketches, letters and documents
have arrived at the Archives, to be in-
dexed and stored away, and careful
photographic and other records are being
kept of all demolition and rebuilding
activities within the city. This material
is there for the use of any duly accredited
historical student or journalist in search
of information, and it has already been
extensively used.
Many things likely to be of value have
been promised to the department, among
them one of the most valuable and
unique records on earth: Captain Walter
Lee’s collection of windjammer photo-
graphs. This Adelaide Steamship Co.’s
skipper has made the collecting of photo-
graphs of sailing ships, and data con-
nected with them, his hobby for many
years, and he now has a collection of
over 12,000 pictures of separate vessels.
For years those who are compiling re-
cords of the days of sail have been writ-
ing to him for information from all over
the world.
I do not want to decry the work which
is being done in other States to preserve
material likely to have a historical value
in years to come, but the fact remains
that the South Australian Archives De-
partment is by far the best thing of its
kind in the Commonwealth.

In Praise of Post-and-rail Fences
If “Cauboy” (R.P. 9/8/’33), in describ-
ing our best-known fence as “folk archi-
tecture,” means to be derogatory, then, as
a bushman, I ask him and others to con-
sider these points.
Post-and-rail fences mark the long-for-
gotten boundaries of many holdings, and
some to-day, after 80 years, are still in
use.
The man who erects one to-day sets a
standard of efficiency not exceeded by
any wire, steel, concrete or other contrap-
tion.
The standard of a post-and-rail is high,
and its regularity so universal that
heights, lengths and areas are still calcu-
lated by reference to it. So many panels
long and wide give an area almost as
exact as a surveyor can calculate with his
eight-chain bands.
A grazier was asked under cross-
examination recently, “What is a cattle-
proof fence?” He replied without
hesitation, “A post-and-three-rail fence.”
No reference to height or length of panel.
That is standard, and understood by all
concerned.
Dad has no fears for his exhibition
stallion and young foals when they are
running in a paddock enclosed by posts
and rails. The jumping qualities of
Dave’s hack are set by his ability to
jump a rail fence, not a wire one; and
£5 extra can easily be obtained if he
can clear a three-rail fence.
Death-adders are measured by the
height of the top rail. You hang one over
the top rail, and if its head and tail just
touch the ground it is eight feet long.
(That of course would be a long one
now that bush grog is so watered.) Old
Corney Prizeman measures Barrier Reef
fish by reference to the rails of a post-
and-rail fence. He told us once during
a fish-lying competition at the Commer-
cial Hotel that he caught a stack of
Spanish mackerel in the Gladstone
harbor and some of them were (he
stretched his arms out —but they were too
short) “as long as that rail,” pointing to
the rail of a post-and-rail fence erected
by the convicts in 1870.
When “Saltbush” was sniped on Galli-
poli his mates asked what it was like to
be hit on the stern with a .303. His
simple reply was, “Just like as if big Mick
swung a rail and hit you.” Not a coil of
wire or “K” netting; just a plain rail
from a post-and-rail fence.
No bush Lothario would ever leave a
message in a cream-can for Sarah, mak-
ing a meet along a wire fence. Down by
the old slip-rails for Dave!
When we were excavating in Queen-
street, Brisbane, near the Regent, we
came across a post-and-rail fence 30ft.
below the ground level. Little Jacky
Hayes remembered it from the early
days ; said he used to tie his rowing-boat
up there. The following day he produced
a photograph of the post-and-rail fence,
and the boat tied to it, on the banks of
a creek that used to cross Queen-street
at that particular point in 1869.
When there is a good waterhole near
the boundary, or on the road, how neatly
Dad and the boys can run a post-and-
rail fence around it! No strainers and
awkward bends in the line; just a neat
deviation or shift, with the rails from
opposite sides meeting in a big gum-tree,
and the whole of the w.h. is in Dad’s
horse-paddock.
As grandstands for sports and race-
meetings our old friend is still very use-
ful and much superior to wire, barbed
or plain.
I once saw the top rail used as a bar
counter. Bung just backed his dray up
to the fence and dispensed liquid fire
over the top rail.
When a bushman dies in the Never-
never, a post-and-rail fence is erected
around his last resting nlace Thorn arp
round his Jast resting place, there are
SeeDcountrr graveyards - even ln
A post-and-Jl' fence can still be an
architectural gem, but not of the bow and
arrow type, as some writers seem to think.
It is efficient, beautiful and, though an-
tique in form, still the correct type to be
used in 1933
BULLOCK-BELL.
A Sa tche l of Books
Cocktail Time, by Starr Wood (Werner
Laurie ; 7s. 6d.). About four dozen full-
length drawings, with suitable gags
attached, by one of the world’s leading
comic artists. Mr. Wood’s wit is not
the kind that enthuses Christian Homes ;
but for the purposes of setting bar-par-
lors, smoking carriages and the like in
a roar it is warranted to hold its own
with a copy of “Ballyhoo.”
The Sunbeams Book (Sun Newspapers ;
25.) incorporates the latest adventures df
Jim Bancks’s imperishable creation,
Ginger Meggs. About 30 of the week-
by-week triumphs and misfortunes of
this pyrotechnic child who never has his
crimson hair cut or wears a coat are
reproduced ; and there are some full-
page drawings of him and his friends.
Great value for the money.
Doc Churston, by Ottwell Binns (Ward
Lock ; 3s. 6d.). The Doc is the idol of
his section of the North-West, and his
hospital is a boon to the natives. He
has a bit of bad luck, and is forced to
flee across the border, leaving lovely
Flora MacLeod lamenting. But it was
all a mistake, and he returns just in time
to save Flora from the vile hands of
Red Murdoch. A familiar plot, but it
is decked out with a number of unex-
pected incidents.
Leaflet No. 17 of the Australian Eng-
lish Association is a lecture on “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream,” by H. M.
Green, the librarian of Sydney Univer-
sity. He has something to say about
the young Shakspeare—his theory is
that the fantasy was written in the poet’s
youth and revised in maturity—and he
goes on to analyse the structure and
characterisation before dealing with what
he calls “the fine essence of the play—
its fairy world.” A scholarly exposi-
tion, and as interesting as a short story
withal.
Saint on Holiday, by Geoffrey
Dearmer (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.), is clearly
meant to be a satire on something, but
the main objective of the author’s scorn
is a mystery. The newspapers get it
hot, as usual; so do the politicians, and
there are passing digs at people like “old
General Dungeon, distinguished as a
survivor of the Great War.” But there
is an exasperating irrelevancy about the
behavior of the characters; more parti-
cularly that of Santa, the Mussolini of a
future generation, who evades the cares
of office by becoming a zoo attendant.
The blurb says: “Read a page or two.
If you like Mr. Dearmer’s style you will
like history.” Nothing could be more
misleading. Individual pages are amus-
ing ; the author is always good on the
subject of animals, for example. But, as
a story, the book is dull.
Nights Ashore, by Capt. Jack Hamilton
(Endeavour Press; 65.), concerns the ad-
ventures of Captain Campbell Muggs,
skipper of the collier Five Stars, and his
colleagues: William Bluster, mate ; Rich-
ard Swigger, engineer; and Arthur
Grizzle, cook. They resemble W. W.
lacobs characters in general outline, but
their adventures are more varied and
exciting. Two rich American ladies char-
ter the Five Stars and go on a hunt for
a pirates’ hoard on Cocos Island. Cap-
tain Muggs and his men salvage the
Western Sun, and spend the salvage-
money on a cruise to Norfolk Island
aboard the luxury liner Strathdon.
Grizzle gets off with Lady Diana Stock-
bridge, and Captain Muggs has a flirta-
tion with Joan, a bewitching blonde. The
blonde turns out to be married, and her
husband thanks Muggs for his attentions
when the Strathdon berths at Sydney.
“If you ever get tangled up with a woman,
Captain, come to me. I’m one of the best-
known divorce lawyers in the city. One good
turn deserves another, eh?” he laughed heartily.
These genial, gullible, hard-drinking
sailormen are always getting into domes-
tic and other trouble, and they face their
embarrassments with comic fortitude. It
is a formula, and Captain Hamilton
handles it as well as most writers.

ANOTHER HUGHES STUNT.
The Commonwealth Government has
good reason to be worried about the sort
of national-defence propaganda which
has suddenly become vocal. The move-
ment started in the wrong atmosphere.
It is being carried on under the auspices
of flag-wagging bodies which are the
natural homes of the K.B.E. and the
limelighter, and its platform leader is
W. M. Hughes, who did more than any
other man, except Scullin (whom he
helped to make Prime Minister), to
reduce the C.M.F. and the R.A.N. to
their present lamentable proportions.
No self-advertising charity concern or
association of house-agents in Sydney
need go without its paragraph these
days. The presence of a member of the
executive of the Defence of Australia
League fulminating about the Enemy
across the Equator and the Greedy Eye
of the Orient and the Thunderclouds of
War and the necessity to be “up and
doing” is a guarantee that any function
will be well reported.
One of the D.A.L. orators enlivened
a luncheon with a picture of a fleet with
battleships larger than the Hood landing
“100,000 men, armed with all the latest
weapons devised for destruction, on the
quiet waters of some northern Australian
rivers.” Then, he said, the conquest of
the country would probably be only a
matter of weeks.
Referring to the Caroline and Marshall
Islands, he asked them to consider the position
Australia would be in at the end of 1935 with
Japan outside the League of Nations.
The same gentleman on another occa-
sion, after picturing wars involving mil-
lions of men, hundreds of thousands of
machine-guns and untold howitzers and
trench-mortars, advised the enemy and
everybody else who cared to read that
“reserves of ammunition in Australia are
practically non-existent.”
This sort of thing is apt to do a
power of mischief. The assumption
that any neighbor is an enemy is the best
way to make him an enemy, especially
if it takes possession of minds in a coun-
try like Australia. When the run is
overstocked it is a very level-headed
grazier who does not feel inward and
natural resentment at seeing the good
pasture next door definitely fenced off
from him by a man who leaves his land
idle and will not take starving stock
on agistment. Between neighbors so
placed, usually the only move needed to
start a fight is for the owner of the un-
stocked land to lean over the fence and say
a hard word to the man next door.
The Japanese have a case, and we
Australians should recognise it. Their
homelands are overcrowded, and they
have no colonies ; their people are shut
out of other lands, and it has been pro-
posed to shut out their goods ; left with-
out an ally, to oblige Washington, they
have an unfriendly U.S.A. on one flank,
and an unfriendly Soviet Republic on
the other, and below it a hostile China.
They thought they saw a chance
of expansion and salvation in German
New Guinea at the outbreak of the war.
Their forces arrived there contempor-
aneously with, if not a day earlier than,
our own; yet they withdrew without a
murmur.
In subsequent war years, when the
British Navy could not have helped us,
Japan was a loyal ally; it played the
game. The only dissension we had with
it was when an idiotic Labor Govern-
ment in Queensland expelled its nationals
from the sugar fields, choosing a moment
when Japanese warships were guarding
our trade routes and transports. During
the slump Japan has become one of the
biggest buyers of our wheat and wool—
where would the wool market be to-day
without it? So far there has been no-
thing but friendship.
Talk about landing 100,000 men on a
quiet northern river is stuff and nonsense.
If the madness were attempted, the
invader would in 15 days have the
British Mediterranean Fleet threatening
the flank of his communications —the
longest and most attenuated naval line
of supply in history. If anybody doubts
the difficulties, let him peruse the history
of the American entry into the war and
consider the vastness of the troubles of
U.S.A. in transporting its troops and sup-
plies across the Atlantic, even though
it had the help of the British, French
and Italian navies. Then the imagined
enemy would put his head into a nut-
cracker, since the U.S.A. as a matter of
unswerving policy would not risk such
an invasion in the South Pacific.
The question as to what position Aus-
tralia will be in when the Carolines and
Marshalls are taken over from the
League by Japan answers itself. Aus-
tralia will be as secure as it has ever
been. The British Navy is now concen-
trated largely in the Mediterranean. The
U.S.A. for several years has based its
operations chiefly on the Pacific, though
it seems to have taken our alarmists
a long time to discover it. The very
justification for the Japanese activity in
the mandated islands seems to lie in the
report that the U.S.A. has been strength-
ening Philippine bases with 16-inch guns
and various other heavy-power devices.
There is Singapore ; and there is a fairly
large British aerial force spread over the
area between the Mediterranean Fleet
base and Asia.
The Bulletin stands, as always, for
adequate Australian defence —for a Citi-
zen Army, with compulsory training ; for
a sufficient Air Force ; for a real Aus-
tralian Navy: capable, all of them, of
rendering help, should help be needed,
to Maoriland, Canada, South Africa,
Britain. But it holds that defence
should be organised on fire-brigade
lines. Organised with efficiency, but
without senseless shouting that Australia
is a lovely place to live in, and that every-
body passing by who has a box of
matches is an arson-monger. Further,
The Bulletin believes that it is the duty
of every public man to do his best to
keep the peace in the Pacific, and that the
platform scaremongers, self-advertisers
and writers of alarmist articles who have
been loosed on the country are doing a
great deal more harm than good.
THE POST OFFICE.
If the Postmaster-General’s Department
is not efficient, it should be. It has all
the powers which even the most truculent
monopoly could wish for. It has the most
expensive departmental head in the Com-
monwealth—he is paid twice as much as
the best-paid heads of other departments,
and more than the Chief Justice of the
High Court. His salary put up a record
in rapid rises—from £7OO p.a. to £4OOO
p.a. in less than a decade. Surrounding
him is a galaxy of 12 officials who get
£lOOO p.a. or more, and 38 more who
get £750 p.a. or more — less, temporarily,
the 22j per cent cut. And above him—
very much above him—is a Minister who
has usually derived his knowledge of
post-office affairs from licking free
“0.5.” stamps.
For all this talent the Post Office is
not an institution of which Australia can
be proud. On its telephone and tele-
graph branches it loses money hand
over fist. When the demand for tele-
phones was great, unpainted instru-
ments half-falling to pieces were some-
times served out, and when these
went out of order for days on end lessees
of them were expected to continue to
pay rent. Recently it was announced
that any subscriber who wants a tele-
phone of the 1932-33 vintage—the
department laid in huge stocks of an
obsolescent type —may buy one out of his
own pocket and pay rent for it. And
the concern will brook no dispute about
its accounts. The subscriber whose
’phone takes it into its head to use
itself during his absence has no redress
short of legal action. The G.P.O. does
not even feel bound to give him details
of the charges. Off with his ’phone!
The telephone branch has a regu-
lation which says that it and its officers
shall not be liable for compensation in
respect of any claim arising out of the
disconnection of a telephone or inter-
ruption of service from any cause what-
ever. It interprets this to mean that
if a man asks for details of his
account and the department, instead of
giving them, cuts off both his business
’phone and his private instrument, it can
continue to exact full rent for the
instruments which it prevents him from
using. And if he suffers loss of business
or damage it appears to imagine that it
is free of ordinary common-law lia-
bility. One of these days somebody will
teach the department how stupidly illegal
some of its coercive methods are. Of
course, the public will pay the bill.
All telephone rents are payable half-
yearly in advance, and any person
who does not pay within 14 days
of getting his notice—who, in effect,
is not 24 weeks in advance with
his rent —is liable to be cut off and
charged a ss. reconnection fee. If private
business were run on these lines and
showed such a deficit as the telephone
branch does (a quarter of a million is
reckoned quite a modest annual loss) the
remarks of the Bankruptcy Court would
be blistering. In the country, where
party lines are a dire need, the whole
party service is cut off if one unfor-
tunate cocky concerned cannot instantly
find his ’phone rent through drought or
misfortune.
The telegraph system, too, is a strange
affair. Telegrams are the fruit of
urgency. The story has been told
(B. 13/9/’33) of how a member of
The Bulletin staff tried to send a tele-
gram on Saturday afternoon to a point
within sight of the G.P.0., and how a
conclave of officials spent several
minutes before deciding that the feat of
dispatching the message could be
achieved only at the rate of 2|d. per
word.. The sequel Is a long departmen-
tal letter refunding two-thirds of the
impost and apologising for the fact that
those in charge of the affairs of the
largest post office in Australia did not
know their own charges for a telegram
to an adjacent part of their own city.
Even this is not nearly so comic as the
zoning system. The resident of Albury
who wishes to telegraph across the
Murray to Wodonga pays Is. 4d. But
he can send a telegram to Cape York,
2400 miles away, or even to Perth, for
the same money. For 4d. less he can
communicate with Wallangarra, 1000
miles away, it being in his own State.
For every five telegrams per head of
population sent in Australia, nine are
sent in Maoriland. The telegraph branch
is just as chronic a loser of tax-revenue
as the telephone branch. Only the postal
branch pays. Of course, its minimum
charge is twopence a letter; and it
got that when Maoriland had penny
postage.
Large settled areas of western Queens-
land have no mail services. The residents
depend on the favor of their friends.
Sydney has a more meagre letter-delivery
service than the smallest town in Britain
and than any petty European capital.
For all this Australia pays approximately
£12,600,000 per annum —a third of its
wool cheque.
The balance sheets of private com-
panies which deal in postal facilities in
other countries, the enterprise and 24-
hours-in-the-day efficiency of the British
Post Office, which made a working sur-
plus of £10,800,000 last year and gave
a range of services immeasurably greater
than those given in Australia, are prac-
tical condemnation of our apology for
a system. What is needed is that
the Post Office should be made to
stand on its own feet as a business pro-
position outside political control. Its
powers beyond the range of common
law should be shorn from it. In a word,
it should be turned into an ordinary
commercial concern instead of being
allowed to remain a slovenly Commissar-
ship which can compensate for ineffi-
ciency only by extortion and bullying.
“SPORTS” AND SPORTSMEN.
It has been an eventful year for Austra-
lians in the world of sport, and a strik-
ingly successful one for some. If the
dreary old “ashes” were lost to the Eng-
lish, triumphs were gained in other fields.
An Australian tennis-player, Crawford,
defeated all rivals in France and at
Wimbledon. An Australian sculler,
Pearce, proved vastly superior in Canada
to the English holder of the world’s pro-
fessional championship. An Australian
track-cyclist, Dempsey, has been hailed
as champion of the U.S.A..
These achievements, of course, are in
no way astonishing. During the present
century there has rarely been .a time
when Australian tennis-players, scullers
and cyclists were not among the world’s
best. In other years our pugilists were
equally renowned. In the late ’eighties
and early ’nineties, a wonderful band
of boxers left these shores for America
and Britain; but, save for Darcy, who
died before he had reached his prime,
they have had no successors. On occa-
sions when teams of overseas bruisers
are brought to Sydney, they have to be
matched with one another for lack of
native-born opponents in their class,
which is generally the second class. The
conditions have somehow produced a
crop of hatchet-faced scrappers, and the
hatchet-faced type is more likely to be
punched silly—as many a poor young-
ster has been —than to win champion-
ships.
But some very unpleasant things have
happened during the year. Chief among
them, of course, was the barney over leg-
theory or bodyline bowling, which was
marked by explosions of bad temper and
bad manners such as never before
attended any series of matches in which
Australians were engaged. The rights
and wrongs of the method of bowling
are still in dispute, if the controversy and
certain of the parties to it are to be
shelved. But among people able to sit
above the paltry battle there can be no
two opinions about the part played in it
by cricketers, past and present, by cricket
administrators, newspaper writers and
radio speakers, though it is doubtful
which country contributed to the rumpus
the greater number of ill-conditioned
bores and the greater quantity of rancid
rubbish.
And the humiliating impression re-
mains that representative cricket is now
to be ranked among the cottonwool pas-
times ; that idols of the crowd are in
future to be shielded from risks such
as thousands of young fellows cheer-
fully take every Saturday during the foot-
ball season. To save English county
clubs from going bung and to enable
our heroes of the bat and ball to go on
making more money than the profes-
sionals get, while continuing to pose as
amateurs, an Australian team is next year
to return the visit of Jardine and his
men ; but for many people in Australia,
and probably in England too, the charm
of Test matches has been broken.
Another unfortunate episode was the
descent on the U.S.A. of Winooka and
party. Such a beautiful specimen of the
Australian thoroughbred deserved a
better introduction. Winooka is owned
by two bookmakers, and was placed
under the direction of a person who has
been bookmaker, sweep promoter, race-
course-owner and other things. To stress
the fact that the enterprise was one per
cent, sport and ninety-nine per cent,
finance, a professional sprinter—two-
legged variety—was taken along. It was
found that there are no professional
sprinters in America, and, leading ama-
teurs having ignored the vulgar offers
and boastful challenges fired at them
from the Winooka stable, the ped. is
being shipped back to Australia.
Winooka remains, to be the unoffending
excuse for blatant braggadocio and cheap
defiances, the latter in part directed at
the American sportsman Whitney. Whit-
ney replied with a snub, which, however
unpalatable to Australians who know
and appreciate the hospitality that people
from this country on genuine sporting
missions receive on the other side of the
Pacific, must be accounted well deserved.
The manager of Winooka, Ltd., was
for years a sojourner in South Africa. In
that country he and other persons of his
type, who are in the game for what they
can make out of it, tarnished Australia’s
sporting reputation. It has been reserved
for the Wallabies to redeem it.
The war dealt a heavy blow to Rugby
Union football in Australia. In Queens-
land it faded out altogether. In Syd-
ney it was kept alive by young fellows
from the Great Public Schools —who,
incidentally, by showing that Protestant
and Catholic could meet in strenuous
rivalry on the football field and remain
the best of friends, their pastors and
masters, too, helped to arrest the spread
of the poison-weed sectarianism. Against
great odds the game gradually regained
prominence, and five years ago the Wara-
tahs, drawn from eight Sydney clubs,
demonstrated in the British Isles and in
France what a fine type of footballer
it produces in these latitudes, and what
a splendid type of manhood.
The Wallabies include Queenslanders
and Victorians as well as Cornstalks. It
goes down on the records that they lost
nearly half their matches, but in a larger
sense they won them all. The Bulletin
has received from Australian exiles
letter after letter and bushels of news-
paper cuttings, all testifying to the great
impression these young Australians have
made on the Afrikander public by their
conduct on the field and off. They have
shown in a quarter which had only too
much reason to be critical that the sport-
ing Australian, when inspired by ama-
teur traditions and freed from the gate-
money taint, is a modest, manly and
likeable chap —as good a fellow as there
is in the world. The Wallabies have
certainly furnished the pleasantest fea-
ture of Australian sport in 1933, and the
one which will have the happiest results.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Exit Bruce.
Bruce has taken the High Commissioner-
ship, and the voice of Lyons, who sug-
gested that he should take it, has been
heard proclaiming how great the loss
will be to himself and his colleagues.
It is Australia’s loss, and it means that
we shall have to put up with Lyons and
do without national leadership and see
the breach between the U.A.P. and the
U.C.P. widen. Bruce was the one man
who could have brought these parties
together. And now he is to remain in
London, persuaded by a clique that
dreaded his return that he could do his
best work for Australia there.
At the very last moment “S. M.
Herald” sent out a call for Bruce. It
declared that the test of leadership in
both moderate parties was the ability
to overcome existing difficulties, adding:
It is rather a sorry commentary upon Aus-
tralian politics that the ablest Australian in
public life, the leader who enjoys the widest
respect in this country, and is certainly the
foremost Australian in the regard of all the
rest of the Empire, should now, at the height
of his career, be discussed in Australian Cabinet
circles as best fitted for the backwaters of the
High Commissionership.... His place is here,
and Australia should appeal to him to take it.
This brought a response as immediate as
The Bulletin’s earlier appeal. The day
the article appeared Canberra confirmed
Bruce’s appointment. It did not even
wait to receive his resignation, which is
supposed to be on the way.

An Australian’s Home.
Judge Macindoe, of Victoria, appar-
ently has given a death-blow to the belief
that an Englishman’s home is his castle,
and to Chatham’s dictum that “the
poorest man may in his cottage bid de-
fiance to all the forces of the Crown.”
Three men appealed to General Sessions
against a stipendiary’s conviction of them
for having been illegally on premises.
They had entered a boarding-house, two
of them being inquiry agents, with a
view to getting divorce evidence, and
the magistrate sent them to gaol and
fined one of them £lO for wilful damage
to a door.
According to Mr. Macindoe, the men
were not unlawfully on premises, be-
cause “they were acting under instruc-
tions and were not there for a dishonest
purpose.” He quashed the convictions
and reduced the £lO fine to £l.
If this Victorian Judge is right, the
law needs instant amendment. If a
private inquiry agent may enter a locked
room to secure evidence that a married
person is there in improper circum-
stances, it seems likely that any other un-
licensed person, by simply getting him-
self instructed as an inquiry agent, may
enter private premises and force his way
into locked drawers in. order to secure
evidence that a missing watch is or is not
there, or that the man owning the drawer
is not paying his full income tax. So
long as he is on the side of virtue he
appears to be all right, and to have powers
which no policeman normally dares to
exercise without a warrant.
«
A Case for Euthanasia.
Dear Bulletin, —The death sentence
passed on Eric Craig, the Sydney degen-
erate who confessed to having killed a
woman in Centennial Park, and who was
convicted of having murdered a young
girl shortly afterwards, has been com-
muted to “imprisonment for the term
of his natural life.” The phrase is mean-
ingless: any future Administration may
recommend the Governor of the day to
exercise the prerogative of mercy, and
let Craig out; and nothing is surer, going
on past history, than that he will be let
out. He will be unlucky if he stays in
gaol for more than ten years.
Yet he will be a menace to human life
till the day of his death. A few years
before the war a Sydney youth who suf-
fered from Craig’s trouble murdered an
inoffensive woman whom he had never
before seen. His death sentence was
commuted by a Labor Government of the
day, to the dismay of a priest who knew
all about him. “The law should take its
course,” said this wise old man of the
world to me. “The boy will be a young
man when he is released, and one of his
first actions will be to murder somebody
else.” This priest tried ineffectually to
prevent the pervert being allowed to go
to the front in 1916, and was relieved
to hear of his death shortly after he
reached France, “People of his type
are incurable,” he said, “and the public
has a right to be protected against them.”
Every medical man understands the
pathological trouble which is responsible
for such crimes, but few lawyers are
interested in the subject; and to the
average member of the average com-
munity one murder is much the same as
another. Craig was reprieved, as the
other man was, partly owing to the repre-
sentations of misguided idealists like
Theo Hill, ex-M.L.A. (“Hanging is pre-
meditated murder”), and partly because
most modern Governments like to avoid
the odium of hanging a man if they can.
A hanging is a shocking business, even
when it is efficiently performed; and
hangings are sometimes bungled. If un-
wanted animals were hanged the
R.S.P.C.A. would soon object; but no
one objects to the humane methods of
lethalism.
It suggests a means of disposing of
people like Craig. On a given night the
condemned would go to sleep and wake
no more. No publicity, no reporters, no
last messages, no sensationalism. One
desirable effect would be to make it
harder for defending counsel to get
round criminal juries; at the back of
most jurors’ minds is the thought of the
gallows and its awful appurtenances. It
would be less terrifying to the victim and
less shameful to his relations ; and, most
important of all, it would relieve the
public conscience of a sense of mediaeval
barbarism which is at the root of the
existing objections to capital punishment.

Queensland Bans Coupons.
Westralia long ago decided that it had
no use for the trade-coupon system, but
its example was not generally followed.
The useless business lingers in N. S.
Wales and Queensland; but in the latter
State it is doomed.
A bill now before the Queensland
Parliament wipes out trade coupons and
the advertising and printing of them.
Queensland agents of southern firms
which distribute them will be regarded
£s principals. In the case of companies
local directors or the manager will be
pounced on for breaches of the law,
when passed. The police or any member
of the public may start proceedings for
infringement; the penalty is up to £5O.
Ordinary trade discounts for cash are
exempted, but not coupons for cash
prizes.
Though the incomprehensible Moore
is hostile, some of his followers are in
favor of the bill, which is generally sup-
ported by the Queensland business com-
munity.

Why Government Railways Fail.
The Victorian Government with its new
Transport Regulation Board proposes to
regulate competitive motor traffic off the
roads —what there is of it. Already most
of it has been driven away by prohibi-
tion, confiscation, taxation and all the
other devices which lazy-minded social-
ised departments use to crush rivals with
whose efficiency they cannot compete.
Other countries have motor services
galore, flying services in abundance. You
can travel from end to end, from corner
to corner, of the British Isles through
the linking of hundreds of ’bus services.
Yet British railways survive. Aerial ser-
vices on the continent of Europe are a
spider-web. The London tubes are full,
in spite of hundreds of M.G.O.C. pas-
senger vehicles, but the railways live.
Here the railways don’t compete —they
smash. They won’t give supplementary
services by road motor or by aeroplane,
and they won’t let anybody else do it.
Even that would not be so bad if the
railways were modern. They are not.
They belong to the world vintage of
1875 mostly; and any attempt to mod-
ernise them and make them the utility
they are intended to be would be met
with stern opposition from the railway-
men’s unions and the Old Guard of
officials.
Railway systems in the U.S.A. and
Germany are being completely trans-
formed to compete on equal terms with
rubber-tyred vehicles. The Union Pacific
has adopted heavy oil-engine haulage
and new types of fast passenger trains,
which are constructed of a species of
duralmin, streamlined according to auto-
mobile and aeroplane practice, and which
can travel at 110 miles per hour. The
comparative figures speak for them-
selves : —•
To carry 116 passengers.
Old Steam New Train.
Train.
Weight .. .. 1000 tons 80 tons
Engine power .. 2000 h.p. 600 h.p.
Average speed .. 57 m.p.h. 76 m.p.h.
On the Berlin-Hamburg line —180 miles
—a train of similar type, which has
an 820 B.H.P. oil engine, is capable
of 130 m.p.h., and actually travels,
allowing for other traffic, at an average
speed for the distance of 78| m.p.h,—
it does the journey in 2hr, 18min. From
Albury to Melbourne on that basis would
be a journey of 2| hours. At present
the lumbering mid-Victorian contraption
which puts up “records” between the
Murray and Spencer-street takes 5 hours
10 minutes to do the job. Its engine
weighs more than the Hamburg train,
which carries as many passengers as the
normal Sydney-Melbourne mail at a fare
of 235. for the distance. It can afford
to. Its fuel consumption ranges from
.391 b. to .451 b. of crude, cheap oil fuel
per B.H.P. mile—say, 7381 b. of fuel for
the journey, valued at about £3 sterling.
It is time somebody brushed the cob-
webs off railway brains.
+
Explorers.
Australia, more than any other coun-
try, suffers from “explorers.” Anybody
can be an “explorer.” Years ago it was
possible to attain grace in the profession
merely by riding a bike or driving a car.
Now it is to be acquired via an aero-
plane.
Some of the motor pioneers did good
work in opening up roads; but they
were not explorers. For motor travel
over any great distance you need a
track, and, as a rule, nature does not
provide tracks till the bones of explorers
are white. A few of the aerial pioneers,
too, have done good work ; the Mackay
expedition has added more to the know-
ledge of the edge of the Victoria Desert
country than any operations since the
days of the Davidson traverse. But aerial
“expeditions” now potter off to regions
trodden by man seventy or eighty or
even a hundred years ago and return,
after a week’s flying, full of phrases
about amazing discoveries of new
Canaans and even more amazing reports
on geography.
If only the individual were affected,
and if vanity could be served without
national repercussions, nobody would be
a penny the worse. The effects, how-
ever, are often national. These people
become a temptation to the politicians.
Some years ago Australians in London
were edified by the spectacle of the West-
ralian Government sponsoring the pro-
paganda of a youngster who had just
taken, the “first wheeled vehicle across
the Murrinji” track in the Northern
Territory, and thence along a route
which was virtually that of Gregory’s
1853 expedition—Gregory himself had
drays, and hundreds of other “wheeled
vehicles” had crossed the region with
men, women and children aboard. The
young man found out of his vast ex-
perience—he had been in Australia for
one-twelfth of his 24 years —that the
country he had “explored” was a land
of milk and honey, and his statements
were, therefore, supposed to be good
propaganda for Westralia. So he was re-
ceived by Royalty, feted by learned
societies. But the stolid City merely
laughed in its sleeve.
This kind of propaganda does us harm
and tends to discredit responsible and
sober summaries of North Australian
possibilities. Thanks to recent “explora-
tion” every statement made about the
possibilities of unsettled Australia is re-
garded abroad with suspicion and often
with incredulity. Men with solid busi-
ness propositions find themselves placed
in the same category with De Rouge-
mont. Half the trouble arises through
newspaper ignorance of Australia. No-
body can publicly become an explorer
without press help. And any sensational
story, with some people, is news.

Planned Economies.
Five-year plans may suit Russians, a
mystical race with almost sub-human
standards of discomfort and docility.
But how is the Roosevelt Plan going to
suit Americans, descendants, for the most
part, of Europeans who went to the
U.S.A. just because that part of the world
offered an escape from oppressive Govern-
ments, and opportunities for self-aggran-
disement? It asks a great deal of
the Americans in sacrifice and self-disci-
pline, and it has been hurled at them
without the years of propaganda which
preceded the commencement of the first
Five-Year Plan.
With wages going up and hours of
labor shortened, with workers toil-
ing furiously, and with shoppers spend-
ing their earnings like mad, the U.S.A.
is to rise Phoenix-like from the ashes of
its previous spending boom, and edify the
world. Professor Moley and Mr. Swope
are confident it will ; so are Mr. Lang
and Mr, Hughes. Reports from the scene
of the interesting experiment scarcely
warrant such optimism; but, of course,
it is too early to judge yet.
Hitherto no device for making nations
rich by Act of Parliament has succeeded
except for limited periods, and in special
circumstances. Free trade helped to make
England prosperous during part of the
19th century, but it only arrived after
British industries had been established
under Protection. As soon as England’s
customers adopted Protection British in-
dustries began to slump, and a stage
arrived the other day when England had
to go back to Protection. In a spirit
equally buoyant, other countries have
tried currency inflation, only to find it
a game anybody can play at. Inevitably,
after such experiments, nations get back
to first principles, as they do after wars.
There seems only one safe road to
prosperity for any country: to concen-
trate on improving the quality of the
things it knows best how to grow and
make.

(Donkey) “Work for 40,000.”
From S. P. McDonald, “Editor of
Publications, United Australia Party”:
The article in “Plain English” (B. 13/9/’33)
ignored the fundamental principle of the Gov-
ernment’s “work instead of the dole” scheme,
which is to convert deadweight dole expendi-
ture into a form of cash remuneration for
work actually performed. It is not represented
as a scheme for providing permanent employ-
ment, but as an emergency plan, pending the
absorption of the workless in industry.
It is supplementary to the Government’s
policy of providing or encouraging full employ-
ment by the following, among other means:
( a ) The provision of loan moneys for public
works —nearly £5,000,000 was allocated for this
purpose during the financial year just ended;
and the Government is in a position to main-
tain this rate of expenditure during the ensuing
year; ( b ) by advances to farmers and other
producers for reproductive work calling lor
the employment of labor —£850,000 was thus
advanced; and (c) by so reducing taxation
charges on industry as to encourage private
enterprise to invest and employ.
Regarding (c), anyone expecting anything less
than a miracle would be satisfied that the Gov-
ernment has performed well, considering that
the deficit for the last year of Langism was plus
£14,000,000, whereas the present Government
brought the deficit down by £10,000,000 in its
first year, and at the same time made sub-
stantial freight and interest remissions. It is
more than a coincidence that during the same
period unemployment registrations decreased by
37 per cent, and dole expenditure by 56 per
cent., which means that the best part of 75,000
men have got back into constant employment,
and the worst part have decided to refrain
from further imposition on the State’s funds.
Your writer states that there are “ample
funds” available from the Bank of N. S. Wales
“for projects that come within the scope of
sound banking practice,” and infers that the
Governments should rush this offer afc “5£ per
cent.” If there are ample funds, and if the
projects spoken of so airily are available,
there is nothing to prevent private industry
from going ahead with the work of rebuilding
our economic fabric so that every unemployed
man can find a remunerative place in it.
The “United Australia Review” de-
clared that the N.S.W. Government had
“replaced the dole” for 27,000 men by
work at “basic rates,” and had achieved
“success” so “unqualified” that the scheme
was to be extended to another 13,000
men. In other words, it has succeeded in
giving single men 9s. 4|d. a week for six
hours’ work where they were given ss.
worth of food relief. Married men
without children get 15s. 7d. for 10
hours’ work, whereas they got Bs. 34d.
for no work.
And Mr. McDonald thinks that this is
a triumph!
According to the Auditor-General, the
public debt increased by £8,303,900 dur-
ing the year. Now £2,400,000 is to be
handed to the Water Board, largely for
sewerage works in suburbs. This will
throw additional burdens on house-
owners, who (as magistrates have declared)
are in many cases worse off than their
tenants. Another probable result will be
a massive addition to the rates, and if
history repeats itself exactly a Royal
Commission will be appointed to find
out how large a proportion of the
£2,400,000 has been thrown away.
Mr. McDonald admits that reducing
taxation charges on industry expands
employment. The Bulletin’s proposal
is that instead of borrowing for public
works, which has been a failure every-
where, the Governments should borrow
on the premium-bond plan for a 50 per
cent, reduction of taxes (which would,
of course, mean reduction of interest) to
the end that the unemployed may be put
back in the jobs with which they are
familiar. “There is nothing to prevent
private industry from going ahead,” the
gentleman says. So the Commonwealth
revenue duties, income tax, land tax and
sales tax are “nothing” ; the State in-
come, relief and endowment taxes are
“nothing”!
The Bulletin does not withhold credit
from the Stevens Government for bring-
ing the deficit down, though the Auditor-
General, by reporting substantial in-
creases in revenue from income tax,
stamp and probate duties, and by com-
menting pointedly on the fact that
£8,999,000 was collected in relief and en-
dowment taxes and £7,185,900 paid out,
has shown that the achievement was not
so dazzling after all. But it wishes Mr.
Stevens and his Ministers were more
alive to the position of the thousands
of decent men who have spent all their
savings and who see nothing before them
but a bit of donkey work now and then,
and to the plight of the idle lads.
In their complacency and poverty of
imagination these U.A.P. Governments,
especially the one at Canberra, are riding
for a fall.

“AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS”
"My dear, you simply must try my new outfitters. They’ve got the loveliest
dresses for the most ridiculous figures.”
“Philm”: In the Perth Police Court
an Italian was charged with attempting
to put one over the Railway Department
by consigning to his brother, a country
storekeeper, stocks of cigarettes in
a packing-case marked “fruit.” A top
layer of bananas, which are consigned
at a cheap rate, carefully concealed the
tobacco. His excuse was at least a novel
one. “Not able to spell ‘tobacco,’ ” he in-
formed the P.M. blandly, “so I wrote
‘fruit.’ ” His alleged illiteracy cost him
a stiff fine.

“X. N. Queue”: I’ve been observing
the effect of Sydney winters on fellow-
workers. Mackay, from the N.Q. coastal
belt, makes continuous moan about sub-
Antarctic conditions. Atherton Cairns is
also uncomfortable,
but more cheerful than
Mack a y. Scotland
Towers came out at
the age of five and
reached Sydney re-
cently ; he was just as
miserable in the winter
as Mackay. Scotland
—f ull strengt h—
admits that he wel-
comes the spring
weather. Melbourne
Riverina is almost as
querulous on bleak
days as Mackay and
Scotland Towers; still,
he finds some comfort
in his escape from Mel-
bourne winters. War-
wick and Dunedin get
along nicely. My con-
clusion is that climatic
adaptation is more individual than racial.
The best climate is the one you have
been accustomed to in early childhood.

“Strict Veg.”: The speakers being
mainly Scotsmen, humor was not absent
from the trial of Prof. Angus for heresy
at the Presbyterian Assembly in Mel-
bourne. Wishing to find an analogy for
a paradoxical position that puzzled even
the law adviser, a delegate from Ballarat
related how he saw one day a billsticker
doing something to a wall which was
already occupied by a poster depicting
a gent, in evening dress sampling a well-
known brand of whisky. Having fin-
ished this job, he went on his way, leav-
ing a slogan, “The Lord will provide,”

“C.Q.”: It was bound to come. Vic.
municipalities are to hold a conference
to discuss a State lottery. The Charities
Board toyed with the same idea
some time ago, but
decided to rely on
the tote, which has
returned £160,000 in
the two years of its
existence. As a
foretaste of the lot-
tery idea, sundry
Melbourne news-
papers have started
competitions. The
“Herald’s” consists
of fantastically large
prizes for punning
titles to “Obstinate
Artist” pictures. Its
vogue is so great
that tenants of the
journal’s Collins-
street house find
difficulty in getting
in and out of the
building, what with the unending swarm
of typists, navvies, dole-workers and com-
pany directors arriving with their solu-
tions and their sixpences.
“M. de Paris”: The averment of “El
Verdugo” (B. 30/9/’33) that I am a tyro
in the lore of executions may be brushed
aside with the contempt it calls for—it
is as if one declared that the estimable
M. Bradman was no batsman. I have
some half-dozen contemporary accounts
of the execution of Anne Boleyn by eye-
witnesses which state that a block was
used. Neither the French nor Dutch
ambassadors specifically mention its
absence; in any case, both were diplo-
matists, and, as chroniclers of fact, to be
rated with mining experts. In two of the
reports it is stated that, after Anne was
blindfolded by Mistress Lee, Sir Edward
Walsingham, Lieutenant of the Tower,
“led her by the hand close to the block,”
where she knelt. As to the executioner,
there can be no doubt he was of Calais
and not St. Omer. In the Records Office
in London can be seen to this day a
SHORT-HAIRED TERRIER: "Aw, it’s enough to make a bloke turn Communist!”
white leather bag containing all docu-
ments relating to Anne’s trial and execu-
tion. One is a record of the payment
“to the executioner of Calays for his
reward and apparail” of one hundred
French crowns—about £23 6s. Bd. ster-
ling. Others record payment to the Lieu-
tenant for Anne’s board and lodging in
his apartments before the execution, and
the handing to him of 20 guineas, to be
given to Anne on the scaffold for the
executioner and his assistant.

“Idle Imp”: Ever tried your hand at
delivering circulars? I have, and I’ll say
postmen need good memories, for the
suburbanite takes a delight in camou-
flaging his letter-box or in placing it in
a hard-to-find position. Some are hid-
den behind solid wooden gates ; others
repose in hedges, or in the gap between
palings ; others again rest on the ground.
A common dodge is to place the letter-
box away from the gate, half-way along
the fence. The ruse is over the odds, for
every circular-deliverer expects to find the
letter-box handy to the gate.

“Dick Swiveller”: I was with a visitor
from Westralia when the pubs in a Syd-
ney industrial area were disgorging their
customers at 6 p.m., many of them well
laden with bottles, which might better
have been consumed on licensed pre-
mises. “I can’t understand,” he said,
“why you don’t copy our 9-to-9 regula-
tion, which is ever so much more sen-
sible.” Obviously it is, too, for the per-
son who needs a drink before nine in
the morning is probably better without
it, whereas to hustle people out of bars
at 6 p.m. is merely to ensure in many
cases that they will take their beer with
as well as inside them. Now that
Uncle Sam has failed so disastrously in
his attempt to make people teetotal by
Act of Congress, and handsomely ad-
mitted his failure, aren’t some of these
half-way experiments in Prohibition also
due for a review? The pre-war hotel-
trading hours may have been too elastic,
but the arbitrary 6-to-6 business goes too
far in the other direction.

“Jos Sedley”: That theory that the
young white man setting out for India
in the spacious days of John Company
could not hope to have a white helpmate
until he returned home years later (B.
20/9/’33) hardly holds water. One of
the chief British exports to India in
those days and after was young marriage-
able women, and every East Indiaman
arriving in Calcutta or Bombay was met
by throngs of prospective benedicts
anxious to look the goods over. For
evidence, see the diary of William Hickey.
Hickey’s accounts of the ladies and the
job they had in picking out the most
eligible partis from the eager mob, with
details of the subsequent careers of
some of them, are exceedingly interest-
ing reading.

“Burlington Bertie”: No need to go as
far afield as Asian trading firms to find
a ban laid on marriage of employees
below a certain rank and rate of pay.
Not many years since every bank in
Australia had the same rule. If industrial
organisation did any section of the corn-
munity a good turn it was in the forma-
tion of the Bank Clerks’ Union, which
enforced a more adequate wage and a
lifting of the marriage ban.

“Adelaide”: S. Aus. has had a comic-
opera sort of criminal trial. A married
woman was charged with fraud over a
£350 cheque which the postman handed
her in mistake for a neighbor of simi-
lar name. Her strong point was that
she, being surprised, rang up the lawyer
who had sent it; and he, naturally sup-
posing that the G.P.O. had done its job
correctly, replied: “Quite all right. It’s
from the Blank estate.” On which she
recalled that she once had a friend
named Blank, so asked no more ques-
tions, and spent most of the money,
Judge Parsons told the jury that if they
thought she, “in some muddle-headed
wav,” believed the cheque was really
hers, they could say Not Guilty. After
a long think, they did.

“Tullius”: One preliminary disclosure
of the census is that Brisbane (334,000)
has overtaken Adelaide (326,032) in
population and become the third city
in Australia from the statistician’s stand-
ard. Another, though this isn’t much of
a revelation, is that nearly half of the
Commonwealth’s population of 6,623,754
i s located in the six capital cities. The
proportion creeps up, it would seem,
inexorably. In 1871 (vide the “Australian
Encyclopedia”) the dwellers in the six
capitals numbered no more than 27 per
cent of the community. In 1906 the
proportion had grown to 35i per cent.,
and in 1924 to 4 5| per cent. Now it is
49 p er cent

“Lao-dah”: An exhibit which attracted
visitors to Melbourne’s first Leather Ex-
hibition at the Town Hall was an old
boot belonging to Customs Minister
white. It was in the sole of this decrepit
article of footwear that White concealed
his diary and also many of his Bulle-
tin contributions while he was a war
prisoner in Turkey. The diary blos-
somed into “Guests of the Unspeak-
able.”

“Pawang”: The horror of leprosy, ex-
emplified by the scare in Melbourne
over the diagnosis of a case at the
General Hospital, seems to be largely
derived from early reading of the Bible,
Actually the disease is far less catching
than tuberculosis, about which. the pub-
fie is comparatively casual. A matron
i n a Westralian hospital was found to be
a leper. She was placed in solitary con-
finement in a cottage, where for some
time she was not allowed even to have a
wireless set, and where she' subsequently
died. Her only visitor was a health offi-
cer. How difficult it is to contract the
disease is shown by the fact that, un-
known to herself, she had had it for two
years, and during that time her bed was
frequently occupied in the daytime by
nurses off night duty.

You reckoned essential
is palpably not.
So, with no skirts to snare her,
The Lenglen reports,
The visibly barer
The better, the wearer
Of feminine shorts.
The briefer the better:
The prayer of the ill;
The hope of the debtor
Who opens a bill;
Of him who sits passive
Where sermons they preach,
Or lists to a massive
Political speech;
The orison old of
The shuddering wretch
Who waits to be told of
' The length of his “stretch.”
These are but a few of
The cases and sorts
The slogan is true of,
And now ’tis the cue of
These feminine shorts.
The briefer the brighter.
The axiom’s the same
For talker or fighter,
For session or game.
Is tennis your hobby?
Set ’bodings afar
Of knees that are knobby
(As most of ’em are).
The ice has been broken
That marked you from man;
The Lenglen has spoken.
Take heed of Suzanne.
With no skirts to net her
When Dian disports,
No petties to fetter,
The briefer the better
For feminine shorts.

“Trewis”: A Sydney newspaper has
been holding a symposium on the idiotic
American practice of doffing masculine
headgear when a woman enters a lift.
As there seem to be as many Antis as
Pros, I suggest a line of conduct pur-
sued with great success by certain kilt-
wearers when the Waacs first entered
the war. To any officer taking his walks
abroad, saluting by lower ranks soon
becomes a weariness. The Waacs made
matters a thousand times worse, for in
ceremonial observance they outvied the
Guards. They were cured in one sector
by the subalterns of a Highland brigade.
By agreement theso, whenever saluted by
Waacs, raised the sides of their kilts
daintily between finger and thumb and
dropped a deep curtsey. Soon there was
no more trouble.

“X.S.”: A Russian Jew, not long resi-
dent in Melbourne, fell foul of the law
in a smallish matter and was duly
writted. He rushed straightway to a bar-
rister. When defendant went into the box
his counsel began by asking his name.
“Vy do you ask me my name?” snapped
the alien. “You know my name already—-
David (Davidovitchski!” “That’s all right,
Mr. Davidovitchski. What is your
address?” “You know my address,”
shouted the witness. “I gave you my
address —you know I did! You are mak-
ing a fool of me! Get out of it! I vill
conduct my own case.” It took the Court
five minutes to mollify the angry
foreigner.

“Unity”: Sydney also has a polite
housebreaker. A Cremorne resident
answered his ’phone the other Saturday
afternoon, and assured the man at the
other end that Mr. Smith did not live
there. A week later the same voice
inquired for Mr. Brown. Next week-end
the householder, home alone, was garden-
ing when the ’phone went; he did not
answer the ring in time. Half an hour
later he glanced up to see an individual
trying a verandah window. He is sure
it was the inquirer, but the latter proved
as fleet as he was polite.

“Desert Singer”; The Broken Hill
song-writer who declared “There is
beauty everywhere you look” was right,
notwithstanding the objection of the com-
“You ought to have been home hours ago.”
"What, an’ miss gettin’ like this?”
mittee (B. 13/9/’33). It may be a beauty
very different from that of green sward
and running streams, but it is there.
Acres and acres of bright-red Sturt pea
hoid the attention more than the most
delicate hothouse flowers ; brick-red wild
hops and glistening everlastings make an
alluring cai pet for hillside and gully. And
Barrier sunsets, with their many beauti-
ful shades of translucent colors, show the
artist, no matter how great his skill or
how magical his color-box, what a poor
portrayer of nature he is. Also there are
golden wattle-trees, acacias with their
floss, and mulga. No futurist or cubist
has been able to show the angular beau-
ties of our massive mine structures, but
Goodhart has been hung in the Paris
Salon for picturing them as they are.
Even our sand is not to be despised: a
quivering, simmering, pulsating mass that
hurls back the sun’s rays with its myriads
of mica specks, and ripples like the
waters of a lake under a zephyr-like
breeze. Outback it forms into bright
vermilion banks.

“C.Q.”: With the centenary year
looming closer, the question of how the
expected swarm of trippers
is going to be accommo-
dated in Melbourne be-
comes more urgent. Even
in ordinary years Cup visi-
tors swamp most of the
available space, and since
the depression there has
been little building done in
the hotel line. Already the
bigger caravanserais report
“full up” for the period
covering the major festivi-
ties. Remain only the
hotels, flats and boarding-
houses in the suburbs, but
few know their names and
quality, since they don’t
advertise. It would be a
dreadful thing if the Mecca
of the South had nothing
but P.W.D. tents to offer its guests when
the haj begins.

“X.S.”: Criminal records? A man
charged with stealing a wireless set in
Melbourne earned his first conviction
in 1899, when he was 14. In the inter-
vening 35 years he has been given 30
years’ free board and lodging at the
expense of the taxpayers of S’Africa,
Maoriland and Australia. The Mel-
bourne beak made it another two years.

“Ben Cubbin”: Honey in hot water is
a favorite aperient among our Westra-
lian Greeks. .One of them tells me the
stuff has other medicinal qualities ; honey
from one special locality was a tradi-
tional food for contestants in the Olym-
pic games. Do the foxglove and thyme
still flourish on
the slopes of
Hymettus? The
traces of digitalis
in the honey
from those plants
would conceiv-
ably have given
the ancient ath-
letes a kick some-
what similar to
that which
“roughies’ ” grey-
hounds and race-
horses get from
the hypodermic.

“T.P.”: Empire
Day people
charged a teacher
in a small Mallee
school with abol-
ishing the saluta-
tion of the flag,
and “flying a pair
of trousers from
the flagpole.” The
allegations were
cross - headed in
various Victorian
newspapers;
now, nearly three
months after-
wards, they have
been absolutely
disproved. The
cruelly - aspersed
girl-teacher had
near relatives
who made the
great sacrifice in
th e war : the
trouser-flying epi-
sode was a prac-
tical joke on the
part of a local
resident/and had
nothing to do
with the teacher.
Similar charges
were made during
the war against a
girl-teacher in the
Western District;
in that case Frank
Tate telegraphed orders for an inquiry.
The upshot was an apology and a con-
tribution of £25 to the school’s war-relief
fund. Pity the Director of Education
was not as promptly approached in the
recent instance.

“Mells”: That every inch of land in
Japan which is cultivable is turned to
some account has long been known;
even the mountains, reported a returned
traveller the other day, are terraced and
rtilised for tree-growing. In that regard
at least Japan can show points to coun-
tries which are centuries older in civilisa-
tion. Yet the necessity for something of
the kind was long ago foreseen. In 1830
Macaulay wrote a rough sketch of what
England would be like in 1930. The his-
torian didn’t foresee motoring, much less
the conquest of the air, but some of his
forecasts (penned at a time when England
was suffering from a depression quite
as serious as the present one) strike the
“Does your mother sunbathe you?”
“How can she? I’m a girl.”
reader as wonderfully shrewd and far-
sighted. Almost the only item which
hasn’t seen fulfilment is that cultivation
would be carried “to the top of Ben
Nevis and Helvellyn.” It has been left
for the crowded Oriental to demonstrate
what possibilities lie in that direction.

“O’Rourke”: The surprising thing
about the claimants to the Martin Burke
fortune, which has now grown to £50,000
and is awaiting apportionment in Sydney,
is that there were only 700 or so, for in
some parts of Ireland the Burkes and
Bourkes will instantly strike the stranger
as outnumbering any other clan. Many
years ago a well-known English novelist
noted the amazing prevalence of the sur-
name. He had been at a country dance
ing how hard it was to identify at a
glance the people he had been intro-
duced to. ‘‘Every second man was a
Burke,” he wrote, “and almost every
woman seemed to have been named
Kate „
'** * *
“Runa”: There is something in the
theory that germs cannot survive in in-
tense cold (B. 20/9/’33). In “Great White
South,” Ponting, artist-photographer
with the ill-fated Scott expedition, says
that colds were unknown in Antarctica,
as no germ could live in those tempera-
tures. If anyone caught anything it was
from a germ that had managed to sur-
vive in the warmth of the ship.
* * * *
“Writer”: The long-drawn-out murder'
case in Sydney which has ended in the
commitment of the sadist Craig to
lifelong imprisonment has provoked the
usual meetings of protest by the well-
meaning folk who object to capital pun-
ishment. One of them said at such a
meeting that “the taking of any man’s
life on the scaffold is diabolical and
cruel.” But the murder of which Craig
was convicted was as diabolical and
cruel as any on record, and followed
on the heels of another, almost as
wanton, to which he confessed, to get
off with a verdict of manslaughter. The
dictum of Talleyrand that it was up to
the murderers themselves to take the first
step towards preventing hanging is well
known. There is one which applies even
more aptly, that of Lord Justice Clerk
Braxfield, of the Scottish Bench: “If ye
hang a rogue the /first time, he 11 no
ye a second. * *
“Light Horse”: The command “right
turn” as a preliminary to dismissal of
a parade fB. 13/9/’33) is not exclusive
to the Y.A.L.; it is part of the ordinary
military drill. When the turn has
been made, the parade stands still for a
second or so and breaks off without fur-
ther comment, unless the man in charge
is particularly fond of the sound of his.
own voice.
* * * *
“Homfrey Beale”: A prison term isn’t
essential to proficiency in match-subdivi-
sion. I knew an A.I.F. man who could
make at a pinch 20 effective parts of any
average wooden lucifer and 12 of any
wax vesta. He used a magnifying eye-
glass to facilitate the following of the
grain, and employed a needle for parti-
tioning—said a . pin was too thick. The
most delicate part of the business,
according to him, was the splitting of
the head, one false move being liable to
disintegrate the whole. Striking the
things, however, requires just as much
art; perfection is only attained after
many failures.
• • • ‘
“Kir”: Match-splitting isn’t the only
form of prison ingenuity. Another is
the application of the same process to
ordinary newsprint for use as cigarette-
paper. The splitting reduces the paper
to the required thickness. With the few
appliances available in prison the job
requires a deal of skill, but one N.S.W.
gaol until recently possessed a master
craftsman who provided ample supplies
for his fellow-prisoners in exchange for
tobacco. Incidentally, a frequenfly-
availed-of method of procuring a light
behind the bars is per medium of an
improvised tinder-wheel, fashioned from
trouser-buttons, enclosing a fragment of
safety-razor blade, which is dexterously
manipulated on cotton strands held in
the user’s teeth against a small piece of
flint.
* * * *
• “Nakhoda”: There was plenty of con-
scious humor in Prof. Wood-Jones’s
Smith memorial lecture at Melbourne
University—the eminent anatomist is a
witty and brilliant speaker—but it was
excelled by a bit of unconscious humor
on the part of a schoolmaster who pro-
posed the inevitable vote of thanks.
Wood-Jones’s theme was the Anatomical
Basis of Human Behavior. Explaining
that, if you removed the brain from a
frog, froggie could still carry on the
business of existence, even to catching
flies and thriving on them, he demon-
strated that there is a great frontal silent
area in man whose function is to dic-
tate purposively to the body. Remove it
and the man becomes a criminal or an
imbecile. Hence the anatomist has
something to teach the world, namely,
that there is an organ in man which is
capable of education. The schoolmaster
remarked that he had listened with great
interest to the professor, and as a teacher
would now go on doing exactly what
he had been doing.

“Pingalapa”: Comment on that
Malayan word-of-all-work Tidapa (B.
20/9/’33) reminds me that the South
African Ikona must run it close for
general utility. It originally seems to
have meant “I don’t know,” but it has
arrived at a hundred other meanings ; in-
deed, it can be employed to express every
shade of thought attributed to the Malay
word. Much the same may be said of
the Motuan Lasi, which ranges in sig-
nification from plain “No” to anything
one likes, according to circumstances and
inflection.
* * * * ■
“Barangkali”: In Singapore, follow-
ing the Tamil New Year, our office was
always sadly depleted for a few days
while the Kranis recovered from their
burns. The most persistent offender was
our head clerk, a devout fire-walker.
On one occasion he had promised faith-
fully to refrain from indulging in his
hobby. Watching the ceremonies that
night I was gratified to note that our
Krani was not amongst the fire-walkers,
and was just congratulating myself when
I saw him. His usual immaculate white
ducks were discarded in favor of a strip
of loincloth, and he resembled a human
pincushion. Safety pins decorated his
lips, ears and nose, and scores of fish-
hooks were protruding from his chest,
arms and sides, each hook connected to
a piece of stout twine that provided the
power necessary to pull a rickshaw
loaded with 14 stone of greasy Tamil.
But he was back at his desk next morn-
ing, looking as meek as milk and not a
bit uncomfortable.


FRIENDLY SERVICE
ALL THE TIME
Some of the time, if not all the time, you must save money, but
if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all the time is nearer
the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one week’s salary, it won’t provide
for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO. No one week’s
salary will provide education for your children, heavy medical
expenses, or comfort in your declining years.
Therefore, to make provision for the big calls, you have to save,
more or less, all the time.
The Commonwealth Savings Bank provides a friendly, efficient
savings service—all the time.

POLITICAL POINTS
Bruce’s appointment as High Commis-
sioner is now definite, and Lyons says
it will be “a serious loss to his colleagues
here.” Lyons was responsible for the
serious loss, but he is bearing up nobly.
Australia, for its part, is expected to
rejoice, since a sacred principle, “the
collective responsibility of Ministers,”
will be preserved.
Perfect specimen of unconscious
humor from London “Times”:
It speaks sufficiently for the strength of Mr.
Lyons’s Government that it can spare for
further absence an outstanding personality, who
is still young enough to look forward, if it be
his inclination, to a vigorous resumption of a
political career.
Who are these giants, again? Yes;
Lyons, Pearce, Parkhill, Perkins, Marr
and Guy.... There will be a ten-minute
interval for laughter.
Stevens is to deliver his Budget speech
this week. If the prophets are correct, it
will give some taxation relief, though not
nearly enough. The burst of Stock Ex-
change buying which followed the fore-
casts shows what might be expected if
our Governments had the courage to
reduce taxes 50 per cent., subject to con -
ditional employment clauses, and issue
premium bonds to finance the deficits.
Six Anglican bishops have issued a
manifesto against the Henry Divorce Bill,
and Bishop Moyes has supplemented it
with the assurance that “divorce on the
ground of insanity is utterly impossible.”
But the utterly impossible has happened
in many countries, notably Maoriland
and Queensland.
Roosevelt is finding that a striking re-
vival can lead to a revival of striking.
One odd fact emerges from these con-
fused Sydney Labor wrangles in which
bankbooks have to be produced. En-
thusiasts for the nationalisation of bank-
ing and the socialisation of credit all
keep their private balances and trust
funds—when there are any—in the capi-
talistic institooshuns.
In their ways of dealing with oppo-
nents the new Liberators of Southern
Ireland are very like the old Oppressors.
They “proclaimed” meetings of the Blue
Shirts just as Parnellite meetings used to
be “proclaimed” by the Castle. Now
they have begun to seize the cattle of
farmers who can’t or won’t pay their
rates. Last week, to discourage the
others, they auctioned a Tipperary man’s
cows. The only bidder was a stranger,
who gave his name as John Brown. He
proved to be a peeler, and when this be-
came known he nearly shared the fate
of the John Brown whose soul still goes
marching on.
Trades Hall worthies whose hearts
bleed for the downtrodden workers are
apt to change suddenly when they get
into Government jobs. Lang put a
pillar of the Sydney ’busmen’s union
on his Transport Commission. Within
a few weeks the gentleman had become
a party to a ukase which threw nearly
all the members of the union out of
work, and very few of them ever got
their jobs back. The same Lang placed
a union organiser on his Milk Board.
The young man promptly assisted to
raise the retail price of milk to 7d. a
quart; it had been 6d. in many parts
of Sydney and sd..in some. He is now
busy with a distribution plan which, if
it comes off, will put many union carters
on the dole.
Stevens has arranged * a loan of
£2,500,000 to finance relief works
“through the Water Board” ; the A.M.P.
is the lender. So, for a year or two,
men whom courageous tax cuts would
put back into their own jobs—carpenters,
printers, electrical salesmen, architects’
assistants, milkmen, shop workers —will
build dams and sewers on starvation
wages while the wet cement hardens
round their hearts.
It is customary for a dust-up to occur
in Vic. Assembly at Royal Show time.
This year it took the form of a defeat
of the Ministry on a resolution moved
by Drew, of Albert Park, a (more or
less) Young Nat., on the removal of
the Geelong Harbor Trust Commis-
sioners. Drew wanted to kick up a
row, but never dreamed that he, Holden
and Dillon (who joined with him) would
be helping Labor and most of the
Cockies, nettled at the victory of Mc-
Donald at the Polwarth by-election, to
throw the Government downstairs for
the night. Argyle talked about taking
the result seriously, but sleep and reflec-
tion made him calmer, and he went on
with the listed business next day.
Forgan Smith proposes to resume pay-
ment of automatic increases in the
Queensland public service from October
BY CANDLELIGHT.
“Having fallen from the limelight, Mr. W. M. Hughes is now flickering from candlelight
to candlelight.” —Captain Fred Aarons to the Sydney Uni. undergrads.
PILCRIM ( rather disconsolately ):
“How many miles to Babylon?
Can you get there by candlelight?”
1 The public service is lucky—there
are no automatic increases for wage-
earners whose incomes have been cut
down to bare-bone level, largely because
Governments insist on taxing employers
to the edge of desperation, and industrial
tribunals are compelled either to give
them relief or to see industry founder.
Jimmy Cornell, leader of the Com-
monwealth men in the Westralian Leg.
Council, is putting up a spirited fight
against secession. Westralian Labor, the
goldfields Leg. Councillors honorably
excepted, pretends to be secessionist, but
its attitude is all humbug. While posing
as a separatist, one of its Ministers, Ken-
neally, remains president of the unifi-
cationist Federal A.L.P. The Govern-
ment is going on with the solemn farce
of petitioning Downing-street and West-
minster for the right to break up the
Commonwealth. It knows perfectly well
what the reply will be in each case, but
it hopes the Londoners will take their
time about it—the longer the better.
Having abolished the Leg. Council, in
spite of a referendum majority of 60,000
for its retention, Queensland Labor ex-
poses itself to the charge of rank incon-
sistency by legislating to prohibit the
restoration of the Council without a re-
ferendum. Butler’s blunder in South
Aus. gave the Forgan Smith Government
an opportunity to tack on a clause with
a popular appeal, so now there is to be
no extension of the life of the Assembly
without a referendum. Foggy is not
without a native shrewdness. In other
matters, such as the measures against
usury, hire-purchase bloodsucking, for-
feiture of industrial insurance policies
without payment of surrender values, and
the coupon system, his Government has
exhibited what is so conspicuously lack-
ing at Canberra —energy.
In the debate on the bill amending
the Queensland Constitution, Arnold
Wienholt said he favored five-year terms
and would like to have the matter made
the subject of a referendum at the next
general election. Forgan Smith refused
to oblige, though he says he is sure of
coming home on the pig’s back in 1935.
The cost of administering these so-
called social services is terrific. Though
N.S.W. wage-payers are unpaid collectors
of unemployed-relief tax and (also with-
out recompense) have to do nearly every-
thing regarding endowment tax, except
give receipts for their own cheques, it
took £254,900, the Auditor-General re-
ports, to manage the social services last
year. Suppose £252,000 had been left in
the employers’ hands, conditionally on
their providing jobs to that extent (their
employees agreeing): it would have been
sufficient to give 6000 idle men three
months’ work at £l4 a month; or 5000
men at £l4, 1000 women at £8 and
nearly 2000 youngsters at £3. And a lot
of that work would have been productive,
which tax-gatherers’ work never is.
Clive Evatt, a Sydney Labor lawyer,
has been adjudged guilty of contempt
of Court for commenting at a referen-
dum meeting on Attorney-General Man-
ning’s part in the Tighe’s Hill eviction
cases while they were still dragging on.
He was ordered to pay part of the costs,
but Manning’s crowd, stiff as it is, has
already provided him with the where-
withal and a lot more. Evatt was coun-
sel for the defence in the Tighe’s Hill
affair, and the budding politician made
such a marathon of it that there were
grave fears that his tongue would drop
out. An evidently astonished Auditor-
General finds that the Government —
yes, the Government —paid him £7lO.
To save maintenance outlay, the
greater part of the Geelong-Ballarat rail-
way line is to be converted from a double
to a single track ; the 801 b. rails uplifted
will be used to replace lighter ones on
the Ballarat-Donald-Maryborough routes.
The Commissioners have convinced the
Ministry that trains between Bannock-
burn and Warrenheip can be run with-
out hitch on a single track. This con-
version is part of a permanent-way im-
provement and upkeep-saving scheme
that will cost £306,000. Originally, of
course, the double track was constructed
out of loans as a “permanent and repro-
ductive work,” and the debt remains.
New measures to
combat s.-p. betting
were discussed at a
Sydney conference
of newspapermen,
radiomen, police-
men and postmen.
This paper dislikes
s.-p. betting, but it
hates the notion of
giving workingmen
another grievance,
and of making the
lives of workless
men even drearier
than they are. They,
it is suggested,
should be restricted,
in one way and an-
other, but the per-
son with a ’phone is
to be left free to
make a wager with
his bookie and get
the price imm e-
diately after the race. There is only
one fair and reasonably sure means
of preventing s.-p. betting—a legal em-
bargo on publication of the weights and
acceptances, other than in club books
sold inside the racecourse gates. But if
this were mooted the eminent moralists
of the evening press would be more out-
raged than ever.
Mark Sheldon mentioned at the
annual meeting of shareholders in
Tooheys that excise duty amounts to
58 per cent, of the price of the beer his
brewery sells. It is actually 2s. a gallon.
So beer is 9d. a pint in Sydney, where
it used to be 4d. ; by the same token,
milk is 7d. a quart and bread sd. the
21b. loaf. What a commentary on the
performances of the Labor-socialist party
which N.S.W. trade-unionists have been
paying into for 42 years!
The Commonwealth Government is
repealing an ordinance of 1926 which
transferred the property of the Ger-
man missions in New Guinea to
trustees under the Administrator. The
missions will now return to their
status of 1920. They did great work
among the natives before the war.
During the war, and for a time after,
they swung their influence against the
new regime, but now that the heat of
the battle has passed it is not easy to
blame them for doing what British mis-
sionaries did in German territory.

During the last ten years. Le Fevre, the
travelling representative of a Melbourne
firm, has crossed Australia from east to
west 80 times, and is still on the job.
The distance covered by him is about
150.000 miles. Although he lives in
trains, cars and suitcases, he enjoys every
minute of it. Many American travelling
salesmen would, no doubt, envy his
record.
Dr. J. J. C. Bradfield, of Sydney Har-
bor Bridge fame, has been asked to super-
vise the construction of the central sus-
pension bridge projected for his native
city, Brisbane. It will be high enough
from the water at high tide to
allow the Canberra and Manunda to pass
under it. Bradfield recently retired from
the N.S.W. public service on the age
limit, but the Forgan Smiths apparently
do not approve of retiring men at 65
except, of course, those in their own civil
service.
F. E. Williams, Government anthro-
pologist in Papua for the last 10 years,
goes to London for more study, on
a Rockefeller travelling scholarship. He
took a short holiday first in S.A., where
he was the Rhodes scholar of 1915.
In 1900 a youngster in khaki, J. R. King,
strolled into the Sydney office of the
Coastal Farmers’ Co-op., then a pup.
When the truck the rattle of which used
to hold up conversation in the only office-
room had stopped, he asked for a job.
He got it, mainly because he had been
eight months in hospital after a bullet
wound in Mafeking. The C.F.S. was very
successful that year—its turnover was
£71,000. This year, reorganised as the
Producers' Co-op., its turnover was
nearly £4,000,000. The limping young-

managed the Bank of North Queensland
and Bank of Queensland, and for some
years was chairman of the Associated
Banks in Brisbane. He knows the North
financially as well as any man alive, and
Australia as a whole better than most,
and it won’t be easy to fill his place.
The Nestor’s ship’s surgeon on its
present voyage is a knight—Thomas
Watts, formerly in practice in Man-
chester, an ex-member of the House
of Commons, and president of most of
the important B.M.A. organisations
around his part of the world in Lanca-
shire.
J. R. Dryhurst, g.m. of the Com-
mercial of Sydney, who died, aged 62,
last week, was an Illawarran. He joined
the bank as a cadet in 1885, became an
inspector in 1916, chief inspector in 1922,
and g.m. in 1925. Next year he organ-
ised the amalgamation with the Bank of
Victoria. A quiet, unassuming man. he
knew his job from end to end, and Aus-
tralia into the bargain.
An old Central Queensland identity
passed out when G. B. Hopper died in
Los Angeles. He was one of the first
American meatworks men to operate in
Australia. Trained with Libby-McNeil
and Morris, he came to Australia in
1896 at the instance of William Collins,
of Tamrookum, and managed the Q.M.E.
at Pinkenba. To Hopper’s efforts was
largely due the raising of the price of
cattle from a 10s. per hundred maximum
to a 225. 6d. per hundred maximum. He
took over Lake’s Creek and stayed in
C.Q. until 1930.
“C.Q.” attends a heresy hunt in Mel-
bourne :
Some of the most impassioned critics of
Prof. Angus were young parsons fresh from
the theological colleges. Some of his most
ardent defenders were greybeards who trembled
with emotion when they mounted the rostrum.
Rev. Tulloch, a comparatively young man
from Westralia, led the attack on the Angus
doctrines in a speech lasting an hour and a half
and delivered, like most of them, in good Scots.
Professors Oxer and Maclean stood up for their
fellow-prof.; Prof. Gillies, of Ormond College,
Melbourne, opposed him. Gillies, a little man,
ran up and down the platform on the tips of
his toes, waving _h is arms like an actor
tearing a passion to* pieces. One of his thrusts
at his opponents caused an astoundingly un-
clerical demonstration, in which the galler>
joined with feet, tongues and hands
The uproar increased when Rev Edwards,
a tall Angusite, demanded a right of reply that
was denied him. Fifty New South Welshmen
thereupon rushed out of the assembly into the
cloisters, and with purple faces heaving bosom,
and gesticulating hands proceeded to hold an
independent indignation meeting. Tl J e m °! f
forceful address came from Dr. Button, ot
Ballarat, a solid, rubicund little dene with a
pugnacious chin —Raeburn painted a dozen por-
traits of Scottish worthies like him.
Responsibility for the denouement was trans-
ferred by resolution back to the N.S.W. Presby-
terian Assembly. Dr. Angus sat throughout the
proceedings with an austere, impassive expres-
sion on his face, which has a mystical quality
about it. He never once opened his mouth.
Queensland unemployed are trekking
to Brisbane, eager for jobs on water
and sewerage works and bridge construc-
tion. Brisbane City Council alone is
carrying 15,000 relief workers. . It is
now asking the Government to pick on
someone else —the Main Roads Commis-
sion, for example.
F. F. Mcßryde, assistant g.m. of the
A.M.P., has entered on retiring leave.
He joined the staff in 1878 and has
managed branches in Victoria, S.A.,
Queensland and Maoriland. Mcßrydc
was born in Balmain, and shortly after-
wards began to play golf, a game to
which he brought a patent swing, and
in the pursuit of which he formerly
affected knickerbockers which were the
envy of his age.
R. J. Bartle, of Auckland (M.L.), is one
of the first visitors to Australia to make
commercial use of the new and cheap
flying service between Brisbane and
Rockhampton. A few days ago he
breakfasted in Sydney and had after-
noon tea in Rockhampton, more than
1000 miles away by rail. The journey
by ordinary means of transport would
have taken 48 hours.
William Coleman, the scenic painter,
comes of a long line of theatricals. Cole-
man, sen., made backgrounds for J.C.W.
for 20 years, and an uncle, John, was
one of Australia’s best comedians. Wil-
liam started covering canvas for the Firm
in 1906, breaking off for 4| years to go to
France, where he alternated between the
trenches, the camouflaging section and
the Digger theatres. He joined Efftee
Films when it was a baby, and is now
scenic director of both Thring’s enter-
prises, the Garrick Theatre performances

tralia’s best-known scenic artists.
and the talking-pictures. During the war
he erected and equipped a theatre behind
the lines, buying the props, from La
Cigale Theatre in Paris. Fritz heard of
the show and sent a bombing ’plane
over, but the Australian searchlights
picked it up and kept it under observa-
tion. The performance was brought to
a successful conclusion.
A. E. Rudder, the man with wings on
this page, is the first man in Sydney to
control a city building with the name
Airways House on it. He is the Aus-
tralian representative of Imperial Air-
ways and managing director of Empire
Airways, which, in conjunction with
Qantas, is to tender for the Singapore-
A. E. RUDDER of Imperial Airways.
Australia section of the London air mail
service. Rudder knows everything about
carrying and transport —whether it be in
a handcart, a lorry, an ocean liner or
an aeroplane. Besides, he is an expert
in civic matters —was three years a
North Sydney alderman and four on
Sydney Water Board.
H. E. Boote, veteran editor of Sydney
“Worker” and a trustee of the Public
Library, occupies a unique place in
Labor ranks. He is a distinguished ex-
ponent of letters and a stylist of discern-
ment and ability. He started as a comp,
on the Brisbane “Courier.” One of his
earliest pen-fights was on behalf of the
miners of Gympie, Queensland. In his
spare time he paints landscapes in oils.
Rev. Father M. Dwyer, of New York,
and his daughter are visiting Australia.
This appears strange, but Father Dwyer
studied for the priesthood after his wife’s
death. He was 57 when ordained in
1918. Prior to tha* he was a member
of the American Bar, being District
Attorney at Boston for eight years. De-
spite his advanced age at ordination, he
has created two new parishes and built
two new churches. At 72 years of age
he is on a health tour.
Ernie Alcorn, dead at Kyogle (N.S.W.),
was a great fighter for the dairy farmers
of Richmond district. He was born on
the south coast of N.S.W., and went to
the north coast as a youth. At Kyogle
he was one of the dairying pioneers.
He was both farmer and auctioneer ; as
chairman, he placed the Kyogle butter
factory on a sound footing. When it
threw in its lot with Norco he joined
the latter’s board and held office till
his death, which took place exactly a
week after the 58th half-yearly meeting
of' its shareholders.
Will Collins, formerly of North Syd-
ney, is making headway on the London
stage. Trained by Harry Thomas, he
appeared with Arthur Greenaway before
leaving Sydney for Canada, where he
worked his way on a goods train to Mon-
treal, to take a cattle boat to Liverpool.
In London he joined Oscar Asche, who
made him understudy to seven characters
in Shakspearean plays. Next he was in
Coward’s “Cavalcade” at Drury Lane,
and after that, he played the leading bush-
ranger in Ralph Lynn’s cricket play
“A Bit of a Test.” Collins has acted in
talkies —“The Midshipman,” “King of
the Ritz,” “Mayor’s Nest” and “The
Good Companions.”

•Subject to an unspecified amount of intangibles.
This co. —it shares four-fifths or more
of the trade in the northern State with
the Queensland Brewery—has put up
very encouraging performances, despite
slump and the inroads of excise and
other taxes upon earnings. During the
12 months covered by the latest accounts
there was a bit more money about, and
unemployment amongst trade unions in
Queensland dropped from 19.9 p.c. to
15.6 p.c. Including £3OOO struck off the
book value of intangibles (now £29,100),
declared net earnings sprang £9333,
reaching 11.4 p.c. on capital as against
9.9, 9.4, 11.1 and 13.4 p.c. back to 1929,
when most of Perkins’s business was
taken over, and 13, 11.6 and 11.4 p.c. for
the three years before that. The div.
remained at 8 p.c., £3OOO was sent to
the provident fund, and what was left
lifted the tangible support for capital to
£118,946.
Another feature encouraging to share-
holders is the way in which the co.
appears to be digging in:

Over the last four years £175,794 net has
been added to the book value of hotel
properties, and the co. did not have to go
outside for the money either. During the
last term £6619 was tacked on to the
debt, which includes provision for con-
tingencies, while £17,500 was added to
the book value of the brewery, etc., and
£17,577 to hotels. The more or less
liquid surplus (£36,239, including stocks)
slipped £16,043.
Until 1929 it was the Castlemaine
Brewery, Quinlan, Gray and Co., which
jettisoned half its capital in 1902. In-
cluding two gift issues totalling £62,500,
capital grew from £78,669 in 1919 to
£372,694 in 1927. Then Perkins’s Too-
woomba brewery, part of its Brisbane
plant and the trade of some 70 hotels
was bought for £lOO,OOO in scrip, and the
co.’s name was changed to the present
title. The scrip was issued at a premium
of £20,000 (= 2s. 6d. a share), which
was added to reserves. Later share-
holders welcomed the opportunity to put
up the money (£90,000) to buy some of
the hotel freeholds. Thus paid capital
advanced to its present figure in a million
fully-paid 12s. 6d. shares.
The market prices the shares at 20s.
Id. as against par two years ago. The
return at the higher figure is 5 p.c. on
an 8 p.c. div. basis. The cover is 14s.

This co. operates three plants in S. Aus.
and one at Geelong (Vic.), and has a

•Estimates.
For each of the two years the export
price averaged around 3s. per bushel,
and the Federal bounty, now computed
on an acreage basis, comes out at about
4|-d. a bushel. Last year’s fertiliser
subsidy of 15s. per ton provided a little
further help.
Still, the co. reports only a slight in-
crease in the year’s sales. The spring of
£19,470 in gross earnings (£113,561) was
due mostly to savings in manufacturing
costs. Exes. (£86,984) took £9379 of
the increase, leaving enough to pay the
pref. divs. and then show 3.1 p.c. on ord.
capital as against 1.6 p.c. in the previous
term. So the ords., which had a dry spell
for three years, were handed 4 p.c., re-
serves being tapped for £5002 to do it.
A feature of the accounts is the reduc-
tion of debtors’ balances by £337,564
over the last three years. As the money
came in the debt was reduced:

Last year’s surplus earnings and reduc-
tions of £26,441 in debtors’ balances and
£4520 in cash, etc., enabled £50,054 to
be knocked off the debt, £8422 to be
added to the stocks item and £9625 to be
advanced to the W.A. co. The more or
less liquid surplus (£353,225, including
stocks) improved £31,130.
The Westralian co. (paid capital
£312,630) netted £14,477 as against
£9217 in the previous year. It paid 4
p.c. on Sept. 8.
Though prospects in the pastoral indus-
try have brightened, the outlook for
wheat is obscure. One danger lies in
the U.S.A. subsidising exports of its
stocks to China, which has been a good
customer for Australian grain of recent
years.
The market prices the co.’s 6 p.c. prefs.
(109,685 of them) at 20s. 9d., and the
ords. at 15s. 3d. as against ss. 6d. a

•Half-year.
Despite steady exchange, modification
of the tariff, less erratic prices and
some improvement in business generally,
this once-prosperous concern, which
specialises in imported lines, has dropped
behind in the race. This is due largely
to the swing of the shopping centre
northward, away from Flinders-street,
and to aggressive competition. Dry-
goods, especially tea, were the trouble
during the last term. So, despite gains
in the drapery section, gross earnings
(£59,229) fell away £605 ; exes. (£62,545)
were £6329 lighter, leaving the loss £5724
less than the previous year’s at £3316.
Excluding the building reserve (£1039),
that thinned the prop for capital to
£20,480.
During the eight years to the close ot
accounts in 1931, £129,812 more was
spent upon premises and plant than was
written off, and £128,940 was added to
the debt:

During the last term £6284 was clipped off
the overdraft (£39,719) and £4Oll off
the amount coming to sundry creditors
(£30,613), while the book value of stocks
was reduced by £11,594 and debtors’ bal-
ances by £3682. The mortgage remains
unaltered at £115,000. When the books
closed the excess of liabilities over
liquids was £8982, an increase of £4961
over the twelvemonth.
The market prices the prefs.—so,ooo
of them 8 p.c. cumulative —at 17s. 6d.
and the ords. at ss. 6d. At next balance
there will be £12,000 (= 4s. 9|d. a share)

This co. is in the wool-and-skin trade,
and its scrip is one of the most specu-
lative industrials on the market. For the
most part it buys in Australia and sells
overseas; meanwhile price fluctuations
are always liable to play havoc with
earnings, especially in the furred-skin
section, where purchases are confined to
the short winter months. Following the
’29 purchases, heavy liquidation of stocks
in London, Leipzig and New York sent
prices in headlong descent, and a loss
of £164,575 showed up, leaving £180,138
of the share capital unrepresented by
tangibles—goodwill figured at £130,000.
To clean the slate 9s. per share
(£180,000) was jettisoned, reducing paid
capital to £220,000 in fully-paid 11s.
shares.
But large stocks had accumulated, and
a further loss of £19,705 showed up in
’3l, followed by a small profit in ’32,
when prices were less erratic. The last
term opened on *a rising market, but
prices sagged and turnover was re-
stricted for the four months to the end
of March. After that things brightened
again, and the net result of the year’s
trading was a profit of £24,503 (= 11.1
p.c. on capital). That wiped out the p.
and 1. debit of £18,396, and left £6107
in reserve; so shareholders were passed
by-
Owing to the recent rise in the price
of wool and skins, the co.’s immediate
prospects have brightened considerably,
but unsettled world conditions make it
difficult to see far these days. Over the
last 12 months the market has length-
ened its bid for the scrip from 4s. to
9s. 6d. The return at the higher figure
would be a shade over 9 p.c. on an
8 p.c. distribution. The cover is 11s. 3d.

This co. publishes the “News” and
“Mail” (Adelaide), “Daily News” (Perth)
and “Barrier Miner” (Broken Hill). The
Port Pirie “Recorder” was sold at a loss
a year or so ago ; publication of the
Hobart “News” was discontinued at the
time the table begins. Meanwhile, an
agreement between the “News” and “Ad-
vertiser” Cos. left the “News” undisturbed
in its command of the evening field. The
agreement was cemented by an exchange
of scrip, thus indirectly linking the
“News” with the Melbourne “Herald”
people, who had become substantially
interested in the “Advertiser.”
The ords., which got 10 p.c. with increas-
ing margins for the three years to June,
1929, have had a dry time for the last
three years—slump wrought a sharp con-
traction in advertising revenue, while
exes, proved to be stubborn. The out-
look, however, is not nearly so glum as
the last line in the table might suggest.
The year was one of reorganisation, fol-
lowing changes in the management, etc.
There was all-round improvement in the
figures towards the close of accounts, and
the progress is said to have continued
since. Gross earnings, to which the “Re-
corder” had previously contributed, were
£3368 better. Exes. (£160,818) sprang
£6485, due, apparently, to increased cir-
culation towards the close of accounts,
leaving the net result £2lO short of the
year’s pref. requirements.
But the market, having sensed out what
the management is doing, prices the ords.
at 18s. 6d. as against 16s. a year ago.
Over the same period the prefs. have
advanced from 255. sd. to 30s. or there-
abouts. The return at 30s. is 5.3 p.c.

This 23-year-old vendor of tobacco,
haircuts, sporting goods, etc., runs a
chain of shops, and has strong connec-
tions amongst suburban retailers. In its
first dozen years the co. paid a steady
10 p.c., sweetened with £40,625 of bonus
scrip. Then it went into debt to buy
property in Haymarket, to which the
’buses were bringing a lot of people.
But price-cutting became endemic, and,
though the business expanded, earnings
have been irregular for the last decade.
Price-cutting and withdrawal of the
’buses were the chief troubles during
the last term. Also the Brisbane branch,
which had become a drag, was closed,
the loss there being £4809, making the
year’s total loss £9306, which includes
depreciation, shown as written off in the
table. The tangible support for capital
was thus reduced to £8892.
The proposed realignment of George-
street, Haymarket, prevented the co.
making the best use of its freehold, which
carried mortgages totalling £132,244
when the books last closed:

To clip £12,089 off the amount coming
to creditors (£65,290) and carry an extra
£11,237 of book debts, the co. went to
its bankers for an extra £9063 (raising
the overdraft £16,176), and reduced the
book value of stocks by £21,805. The
excess of liabilities over more or less
liquids increased £7240 during the
twelvemonth, reaching £57,164; the
floating debt (£81,466) was well covered.
Shareholders’ prospects depend largely
upon the success or otherwise of efforts
now being made to combat the price-
cutting evil. The pound shares, covered
by 21s. in net tangibles, are priced at
6s. 6d. on the market.
The Kawarau Scheme
About eight years ago the Kawarau G.
M. Co. (capital £15,000 in shilling shares)
built a dam across the Kawarau a few
miles east of Queenstown on Lake Waka-
tipu. The idea was that during the winter
months, when the lake was four to five
feet below its summer level, the gates
of the dam would be closed, thus en-
abling the bed of the river, over which
the co. held mining rights for 42 years,
to be worked. The stream had been
cut up into quarter-mile claims, which
were leased for seven years, renewable
for another five upon approval by the
co. The terms were 20 p.c. of the gold
won after payment of wages, plus a
maximum liability of £lOOO towards the
cost of the dam, etc. The scheme failed,
because everything had been planned on
the assumption that the lake provided
all but a trifle of the volume of the
Kawarau. Actually, the discharge from
the Shotover and the Arrow made min-
ing of the riverbed impossible.
Meanwhile, gold won from the banks
of the stream and from the river flats
around Cromwell, where the Kawarau
and Clutha junction to form the Moly-
neux, kept interest in the venture alive.
So, about three years ago, a new co.,
Amalgamated Kawarau, was formed to
weld the interests of the parent co. and
the claimholders. Nominal capital is
£150,000, of which claimholders are to
receive approximately £104,000 in paids
(shilling shares) in return for money
put up by them for construction of the
dam, etc.; the parent co. will receive a
further £13,000 in paids (one for every
eight issued to claimholders) for rights,
etc. After considering the reports of
Professor Hornell, the Swedish engi-
neer, and others upon the problem of
further dewatering the Kawarau, the
board proposes to build another dam a
few miles further downstream to hold
back the waters of the Shotover and the
Arrow. To finance the work £lOO,OOO
worth of fresh scrip will be offered pre-
sently. When fully subscribed and paid,
the new issue will give the co. a working
capital of £133,000 less brokerage, etc.,
out of a total of £250,000.
For the six months to June 30, Aus-
tralia’s gold production was 53,1000 z.
better than for the corresponding half
of 1932, and about 50 p.c. better than
for the first half of 1931. Here are the
figures, showing each State separately:

The first sod has been broken on the
Great Northern, Gympie (Q.). The site
of the shaft is near the old Great West-
ern workings, and the auriferous section
is expected to come in at 400-500 ft., and
to extend, possibly, to a depth of over
1000 ft. W. H. Reeve, a former Gympie
mine manager, is in charge. The sur-
rounding country is taken up to the limit,
and one of the biggest groups in Aus-
tralia is said to be negotiating for a
footing.
* * * *
Further geological investigation of the
Gympie goldfield has disclosed another
area besides the Great Northern that
seems to be well worth close attention.
The big Inglewood crosscourse was sup-
posed to have cut off the rich Monk-
land gold series; indeed, £lOO,OOO was
spent some 30 years ago looking for
them, but without success. Government
Geologist W. H. Rands then expressed
the opinion that there was little chance
of cutting the series on this part of the
field. Geologist J. H. Reid, however,
has just produced a report on this area
(the Sovereign), in which he says there
are sound reasons for considering that
the gold-production beds may be present
throughout it; a point which can be
proved or disproved by boring, at a cost
of less than £lOOO. Considering what
Monkland gave to its lessees, this area
should be worth testing. Reid’s explana-
tion involves great and unsuspected fault-
ing of a type that is prevalent through-
out the field. Because of these faults
or crosscourses the all-important forma-
tions have been lost in the several shafts
which attempted to locate them. Leases
have already been applied for, and Gym-
pie’s prospects of sound revival appear to
be very bright indeed.
* * * *
Herbert Gepp is advising the Queens-
land Government on a complete scheme
for the development of the mineral re-
sources of the Cloncurry field, and his
report is expected any time now. It
will coincide with a marked revival of
interest in gold-mining there ; options by
southern cos. have been taken over the
Crescent leases at May Downs, and over
the Comstock and Freda lodes. The
Gilded Rose is. also producing small
parcels of high-grade ore ; the last five
tons yielded 450 z. of gold. The big
question will be the possibility of profit-
ably working the immense low-grade
copper bodies. In this connection a
central smelter at Cloncurry has been
spoken of.
* * * *
Tin-mining in the Cooktown (N.Q.)
district is looking up again. At the
Phoenician, near Mount Amos, which
has been worked on and off for the last
30 years, a recent crushing from the
150 ft. level yielded 68 p.c. concentrates,
worth £l5O per ton. Claims are also
being worked at Rossville and China
Camp. On the tableland a modern sluic-
ing plant has been installed at the Nil
Desperandum. Here, values on the sur-
face are payable, and increase as they
go down.
* * * *
A Townsville syndicate has taken up
the old Hadleigh Castle in the Ravens-
wood district (N.Q.). It used to be worked
by an English crowd, but costs were
too high; crushings averaged about
lldwt. over the plates. The intention is
to sink a shaft to about 500 ft. to cut
the main and two subsidiary bodies.
* * * *
“Ex-P.”: Undaunted by the failure of
Towers Mining Exploration Co., Towers
Drilling, Ltd., has commenced boring on
the old St. George and Home Rule reefs.
The St. George was a rich producer in
the early days, all the gold being won
from shallow workings. The Sovereign
yielded approximately 12,0000 z. of gold,
worth about £60,000. The Home Rule,
which runs parallel, was also a good pro-
ducer.
* * * *
Mt. Coolon will pay another shilling
per share on Oct. 27. But the market,
doubtful whether values will live at
depth, and. mindful of the refractory
nature of the ore, prices the fully-paid
10s. shares at 11s. 6d.

For the fourth time in succession
shareholders in Hetton Bellbird, one of
the star performers in the gas-making
group of N. S. Wales pits, have been
shown an empty basket. The loss for
the 12 months to June 30 was £13,495 ;
it was £1154 for the previous term. All
assets are lumped at £500,925, down
£20,855 during the year. The shrinkage
in liabilities was £15,338. The market,
which fails to see much brightness in the
outlook, prices the pound shares at
6s. 9d.
* * * *
Adelaide-controlled Bega Mines, operat-
ing on the N. S. Wales South Coast, has
sold 12,000 contribs. at a shilling apiece.
As for values, the property has thus far
shown fair quantities of iron pyrites, but
not much else. The board has taken an
option over the Coramba King (N.S.W.),
said to be favorably recommended by
C. G. Gibson.
* * * *
Golden Gate, Nundle (N.S.W.), has
bought a small crushing plant, which
should be erected in about a fortnight.
There is 1500 tons of stone, expected to
average Bdwt., ready.
* * * *
Endurance Tin has taken a three
months’ option over the Pioneer Co.’s
property, Tas. The purchase price is
£15,000. The Pioneer put up the shutters
early in 1932. Though ground worked
for the 12 months to June 30, 1931,
averaged 3.721 b. per cubic yard, the co.
was unable to make any profit out of
it, notwithstanding that the metal aver-
aged well over £lOO per ton in London.
Meanwhile costs have come down con-
siderably.

Wiluna Gold Corp., the London con-
cern whose big mine in Westralia is
operated by an Australian subsidiary,
Wiluna Gold Mines, Ltd., is offering
250,000 new £1 shares at a premium of
£l. The money is wanted to lighten the
debt and provide for further develop-
ment of the co.’s promising northern
areas. The debt includes £225,000 of
6 p.c. notes outstanding in the subsidiary;
they are the balance of £300,000 worth
issued in June, 1930, and guaranteed
by the Federal and Westralian Govern-
ments. The parent also has £290,150 of
10 p.c. notes outstanding. It has given
six months’ notice of intention to repay
these. Holders, however, have the right
to convert into shares at par; it is un-
likely, therefore, that much, if any, of
the proceeds of the new share issue will
be absorbed in this direction. Liquida-
tion of both note issues is expected to
result in an aggregate saving of about
£50,000 p.a. in interest. Capital expen-
diture on the 40,000-tons-per-month
plan programme is about complete ; so,
subject to further outlay on exploration
and development, the profits of the sub-
sidiary should henceforth become avail-
able for distribution through the parent,
whose pound shares are fetching around
675. in the local market, and 565. 6d. in
London.

Metals Investigation has bought the
Blue Gap, which lies between Boulder
Perseverance and Associated, for over
£30,000. It is a six-acre lease, owned by
Ernest Williams, Greenhill, Fitzgerald
and Winter, and worked by Boulder Per-
severance on a royalty basis. Metals In-
vestigation is developing nearly a dozen
leases in prominent positions on the Mile.

At the British Flag, Laverton (W.A.),
a lode formation, 4ft. to sft. in width,
has been located by loaming. Pan pros-
pects have yielded an ounce and over.
The find is about three chains west of
the ridge which contained the rich quartz
vein that yielded specimens to the value
of £15,000 in the early days. The strike
is claimed to be a continuation of the
Craiggie lode, which produced £500,000
worth of gold down to 250 ft. The
property is being worked by Dr. C. W.
Laver, of Kalgoorlie.
* * * *
The Enterprise, Kalgoorlie (W.A.), is
reported to have struck a lode at depth,
showing telluride and free gold. The
property is identical with the old Boulder
No. 1 block, and adjoins Boulder on the
north and South Kalgurli on the west.
It is held under option by B. H. Prop,
from a local syndicate, in which Boulder
Perseverance has a quarter interest.

Over the last three months Golden
Horseshoe (New) has obtained the fol-
lowing results from retreatment of its
big heap of tailings on the Golden Mile
(W.A.):
June. July. Aug.
Tonnage treated .. 39,120 40,390 41,480
Value of yield* ~ £6,011 £6,182 £6,319
Working exes.* .. 4,494 4,681 4,815
Working profit* .. 1,517 1,501 1,504
•Estimated.
The yield is calculated at the “standard”
price of gold, and does not include ex-
change. The dump originally contained
2,859,000 tons, of which more than
1,250,000 remain to be treated.

Wavic Gold Development, which is
opening up the Two Boys at Higginsville
(W.A.), has crushed 102 tons for 70oz.
over the plates. About 30 tons of the
stone came from No. 5 shaft, where new
developments have disclosed values of
from 30dwt. to 35dwt.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
R.W.: Impossible to say. Though London
funds are accumulating at the moment, early
alteration of the rate is very doubtful Rose
Bay: Not unless you think you know when to
get out. Much depends upon the success or
otherwise of the co.’s efforts to build up an
export trade with the Dutch East Indies....
N.F.G.: It is a speculation; if you cannot
afford to lose, keep out E.G.W.: These
bonds, which are not listed on the Stock
Exchange, are long-term speculations. The
estimate of profits is no more than a wild guess.
...Argent: Doesn’t look like a winner
F.A.C.: (1) and (2) No, it is a long-term
speculation. (3) Very doubtful L.E.P.: (1)
The control doesn’t seem to worry much about
the show. (2) Market manipulations may be
keeping price down, but non-producing mines
are highly speculative. (3) Have no details
999: No definite information, but seems
highly speculative R.W.8.: (1) Widths,
depths and values of Wiluna given B. 23/8/ 33.
(2) Cannot say. (3) Not a dyke formation
M.L.McC.: Stedman-Henderson ord. share-
holders received 3 p.c. for year on Sept. 14
H.M.D.: (1) No regular market for shares;
whether worth holding depends on what you
can get for them. (2) No balance sheets or
other information. Scrip not listed... .T.M.T.:
Leave them alone... .Simple Simon: (1) No.
The risk is incurred from date of acceptance
only. (2) Yes. (3) Usually a few philanthropic
persons act as guarantors. But as policies often
do not become claims for many years, a well-
supported mutual office may have ample funds
when claims begin to fall due... .S.M.E.: (1)
Sorry, cannot. (2), (3), (4) and (5) Might be
worth averaging on United Provisions; they
seem low. Better hold others. Buckley (ords.)
might be worth looking at.


SHADOW SHOWS.
Bebe Daniels, in “Cocktail Hour,” at
the Regent, should have a success of envy
these man-short days. She portrays a girl
who is pestered with offers of marriage
by handsome young men, but remains
provokingly indifferent. We know that
masterful Randolph Scott will have the
doubtful privilege of leading her to the
altar in the end ; but in the meantime
she must be taught her lesson.
Sidney Blackmer does the teaching. She
has an affair with him aboard a liner on
the way to Europe, only to find at the
end of the trip that he is married. Heart-
broken, she goes on a prolonged drunk
with Muriel Kirkland, whom she has met
early, in the voyage, and a Cockney taxi-
driver. Later, in Paris, Mr. Blackmer re-
enters her life and is thrown through
the window of her hotel by another of
her admirers for ungentlemanly behavior.
Hardly has she been arrested for the
crime when Randolph arrives from the
U.S.A.; the police drop the case, and
the harassed child turns penitently to the
man whom, deep down in the secret
places of her wayward heart, she has
loved all along.
Miss Daniels acts vivaciously as always
—she is particularly good in the drunk
sequences—but she is years too old for
the part. Muriel Kirkland has some
amusing lines as her sophisticated friend,
and Sidney Blackmer is suitably despic-
able as the shipboard seducer. The set-
tings are splendiferous even for Holly-
wood. What shocks Americans must get
who accept as representational these
Parisian interiors, suggestive of the
Temple at Luxor furnished by a New
York firm of interior decorators, when
they first enter an unobtrusive little
luxury hotel like the Meurice!
In “Private Detective No. 62” Wil-
liam Powell is vice-president of the Peer-
less Inquiry Agency. He has fallen to
this, after being bowled out in France as
an American Secret Service agent. The
thing teems with absurdities. One of the
most incredible features is that Margaret
Lindsay should let the proprietor of a
gambling hell owe her her winnings—
-45,000 dollars. It is equally unbelievable
that the proprietor should ruin his repu-
tation as a gamester by asking for credit.
The debt is the basis of the plot.
The proprietor asks Powell’s ruffianly
partner to deal with Margaret. Powell
intervenes with the smooth, shopwalker-
ish efficiency for which he is celebrated,
seizes the money, shows up the villains
and marries the girl. He has a part
that suits his poker face and restrained
methods, but Miss Lindsay’s goings-on
preposterous from start to finish. A
pity: she looks nice, and her voice and
articulation are beautiful.
* * *
“Her First Mate” heads the bill at the
Capitol. Slim Summerville —much the
same as in previous films —peddles pea-
nuts on a ferry steamer. He has man-
aged to convince his wife (Zasu Pitts)
that he is first mate of the leviathan.
Zasu —who does all her old business over
again—ekes out the family income by
typing.
They have 5000 dollars in an odd
kind of bank which allows both of them
to draw cheques for the full amount of
the deposit. Slim buys a sailing ship of
a sort unknown to nautical science, re-
ferred to by the vendor as a schooner;
Zasu buys a ferry steamer. The schooner
turns out to be a rum-runner, and is
scuttled by a destroyer; the steamer hits
a wharf and explodes. No insurance on
either. But the purchase of the steamer
involved the sale of certain land trans-
port rights which were immensely valu-
able, and at the end Zasu and Slim still
have a stake in the country. The moral
seems to be that an American husband
and wife can’t possibly lose their money
provided they love each other.
“The Devil’s in Love” takes the jaded
follower of the talkies to an undefined
region in the Sahara where Victor Jory
and David Manners, assisted by a whole
raft of ugly pugs who die cheerfully to
gain one smile from their masters, com-
pete for the love of such women as
Loretta Young and Vivienne Osborne.
At the outset somebody gets poisoned,
Victor Jory is suspected, and it is not till
machine-guns have wrought awful havoc
among the desert sheiks that the phantas-
magoria winds its way to a happy fade-
out.
* * ¥
Frank Pettingell, as a drunken mem-
ber of a temperance society, is respon-
sible for the only laughs in “The
Medicine Doctor.” Claude Allister
agrees to impersonate a doctor friend for
a few hours. Unfortunately the neigh-
boring police surgeon chooses that very
night to go off duty. Allister has to
take his place, and you can guess what
follows.
“The Crime at Blossoms,” which com-
pletes the bill at the Haymarket (soon
to be the Civic), is a film version of the
well-known play. Blossoms is an Eng-
lish cottage. Its owner, Hugh Wakefield,
lets it to a lady who, a few days later, is
found dead beside the murdered body
of her lover. Wakefield’s wife is scandal-
ised, on her return, at the morbid curi-
osity of her visitors. But she soon gets
over this and proceeds to commercialise
the horror by describing it and selling
souvenirs to char-k-banc-loads of sight-
seers. Joyce Bland is effective as the
wife, and Wakefield is convincingly im-
provident as the husband.
“SECRETS” AT SYDNEY LYCEUM.
(Top to bottom): Leslie Howard, Mary Pickford, Aubrey Smith and two assorted
villains.
As pacemaker on its record-breaking
run at the Mayfair, “Tell Me To-night”
now has Mrs. Belloc Lowndes’s “The
Lodger.” Ivor Novello is suspected of
being the mysterious slayer of women.
He is arrested, escapes, and the mur-
ders continue, then —but the climax is
the essence of it.
The story has been altered consider-
ably to provide a happy ending, but it
remains a genuine thriller. Novello is
a good lodger but a poor lover, and
Elizabeth Allan is interesting as the
heroine.
Sundry Shows
It is already old-fashioned to refer to
Jean Sibelius as a modern composer, but
he was still taking lessons in the ’nine-
ties. For a while, like Palmgren, he
dredged for themes among the folk-
songs of his native Finland. Inspired
by these he became inventive and pro-
duced music of a strange quality. You
hear it for the first time and you say
to yourself “Surely I have known that
all my life.” That doesn’t mean, in this
case, that the composer is a plagiarist,
conscious or unconscious. It merely
means that he has recognisably expressed
a familiar thought in a universal lan-
guage. One night last week Sydney Con.
orchestra performed the “Saga.” Sibelius
says this means “The sadness of spring,”
which is one of Herr Teufeldrosch’s
paper-bags enclosing an idea we all feel,
but which even the most soul-searching
of poets hasn’t yet managed to com-
pletely crystallise in words. Sibelius
shows us the paradox of sorrow flicker-
ing in the heart of the brightest gems
of joy. Mechanical means are simple
—joy in the treble, doom in the bass.
Less subtle, but more of an answer
to elemental questions, came the Bach
D Major “Magnificat,” with vocal
parts nicely interpreted—Sydney’s new
soprano Elsa Corry had a part in this
—and the Bach D Minor Concerto for
Two Violins, the fiddles played by
George White and Lloyd Davies. Gus-
tav Holst and Vaughan Williams were
represented on the programme, but these
composers were overshadowed by Bach
and Sibelius.

At the rooms of the Forum Club,
Sydney, on Saturday afternoon Miss
Shadforth Hooper introduced to a select
audience her pupil, David Maddison,
who, if he has nothing else to recount,
will be able to tell his grandchildren
that he gave his first pianoforte recital
at the age of six, in the presence of vice-
royalty. The youngster played (from
memory) the Beethoven Sonata, Op. 49,
No. 2, written for juvenile fingers, some
small romantic pieces by Schumann and
Heller, and short dance movements by
Bach and Handel. There were a few
slips and slurs, but the boy has been
soundly taught, and he appeared to be
not in the least nervous.

At Sydney Royal “The Quaker Girl”
continues her colloguing with bad, bad
boys, and seems likely to continue to
do so for some weeks to come. Dot
Brunton’s “Road House” will call “Time,
gentlemen, please!” next Wednesday—
the co. goes to Melbourne. Ella Shields
has departed from the Haymarket Tiv.,
where Stuart and Lash now lead the
merrymaking in the revue “Broadway
Boys.”
* * *
This year’s Melbourne Show lacked
something. The Clydesdales were as
monstrous as ever, and so were the bulls,
one of which was seen being led round
the ring by an old lady who looked as
indifferent as if the gigantic animal were
a pet poodle being taken for an airing.
The pumpkins were as huge as ever. But
most of the Showgoers looked as if .they
had brought the depression in with them.
Not a sign of hustle anywhere, as if the
place had been handed over to the Gov-
ernment. Even the salesgirls were mov-
ing like robots. The sideshows had
been hit by the talkies, like the legi-
timate theatre, apparently. There were
fewer than usual. Elsa, the half-man,
fulfilled expectations. Used to be the
bearded woman, but now shaves daily.
He-she was right side large leg, large
foot, strong arm, capable of lifting a
loaded lorry; left side, feminine leg and
foot, and opulent bosom. Also two
voices, one drenched in feminine charm,
the other imbued with deep intonation
of a male American. In another tent
Venus, the jiu-jitsu woman, rolled about
the floor with a representative of his
Majesty’s Australian Navy. The blue-
jacket won. In another tent Jimmy Shar-
man’s fighting troupe challenged the
world. The world had to meet Billy
Grime. Time didn’t serve to consult
Delso, the expert in occult science, the
man who knows, and The Bulletin’s
last chance of learning the extent of the
corner the country is turning has gone
west.
* * *
Frank Neil dipped his pannikin into
the Royal Show cornucopia on Saturday
at Melbourne Palace and drew out a
houseful. Neil does not appear in his
revue, which is bounded on the north by
Ella Shields, on the south by Syd Beck,
on the east by the Five Famous Whirl-
wind Cleveres, and on the west by the
Big Four in Gems of Harmony. The en-
closed territory is split up for closer
settlement by the usual songandance
shepherdesses and smokeroom jest-
farmers, and carries about 14 horse-
laughs to the acre, as well as some inci-
dental Egyptian and Spanish scenery.
Time has not added a wrinkle to Miss
Shields or a crease to her masculine up-
holstery. Burlington Bertie remains her
chief staff of life, but she has added some
fresh songs with the requisite yearn in
them. Syd Beck’s faith in the entertain-
ment value of word-mangling remains
unshaken, Tlje Cleveres are amaz-
ingly skilful and powerful acrobats, and
two of the strongest of them would do
wonders if yoked to a plough in a sod-
turning competition. The show should
keep the booking-office busy for a long
time.
V
The Bulletin has regretfully to report
that for the first Show-time in the memory
of its oldest Melbourne inhabitant it is
unable truthfully to mention that Wirths’
Circus has arrived at Olympia. In its
place appeared its strenuous country
cousin, Thorpe McConville’s “Wild Aus-
tralia.” The animal side of McConville’s
show is horse, slightly flavored with
steers, calves, mules and donkeys. Its
chief advantage is that, like community
singing, the audience can join in. After
this critic had watched 20 small boys
bucked off horses and another 20 bucked
off steers, he retired with lungs full of
sawdust.

The Threshold Theatre, of Adelaide,
burst upon Melbourne at Scots Hall on
Saturday with “Fun o’ the Fair,” mainly
English folk songs, acted by Wynne Ken-
dall, Hazel Medland, Marjorie Kyle,
Kathleen Clarke, J. E. Campbell and
Barton Hack. Present writer would like
to be kind to the noble city which heard
(without excitement) his first infantile
yell, but what he saw of the Thresholders,
which wasn’t very much, failed to im-
press him. It was more pretentious than
a school break-up concert, but less
amusing.
* * *
Melbourne refused in large numbers
to see the joke in the baby-farm un-
leashed at the King’s by Theo Shall, and
a small and apathetic house surveyed the
manoeuvres of the Viennese star on Satur-
day. The Royal was crammed for
“Music in the Air,” the word having gone
abroad that J.C.W. had here uncorked a
bottle of uncommonly good vintage.
* * *
The most thoughtful of the four plays
put forward by the Playlovers’ Club at
Melbourne’s Kelvin Hall was “The Gate
of Gold,” by Marion Grantley Shelton.
Miss Shelton was earnestly desirous of
showing her audience how fathers sacri-
fice their own advancement to benefit
their sons, and how the ungrateful whelps,
after an expensive education, often insist
on choosing a calling of their own. In this
case the young man prefers running away
to sea to running to seed as a city law-
yer. What Miss Shelton fails to appre-
ciate is that a sailor’s life isn’t necessarily
any worse than that of a lawyer’s, and
may conceivably be more useful. Also,
she uses such mouldy old devices as souls
that talk from behind screens. In these
materialist days they are utterly uncon-
vincing. “A Study in Monarchy” was
a dialogue by John Hugh Sutton, a Mel-
bourne Uni. lad who was killed in an
accident at 19, and of whom great things
were predicted. This was not a good
specimen of his writings. “Light Break-
ing Through,” by Joan Harvey, and “Out
of a Clear Sky,” by Doris Hayball, would
merit a line or two in The Bulletin’s
Answers to Correspondents column. The
last-mentioned bellowdrama provided
George Hillman with scope for some
excellent acting.

ABORIGINALITIES
“The Secretary”: I don’t often intrude
into Abo. Council discussions. At the
request of many members, in 1926, I
issued a gentle warning to liars, and I
repeated it, rather more gently, in 1929.
Since then contributors to the symposium
have, even when they thought they were
lying, kept so near the shores of the
River of Truth that I have wondered at
their moderation. The honor of arous-
ing the largest crop of growls that has
been dumped on my desk for eight years
belongs to “Furneaux,” who made asper-
sions on the edibility of mutton-birds.
To publish all the replies—-one or two
got in before the deluge was in full swirl
—would take about ten pages, but the
weight of evidence goes to show that
PRODIGAL: “Well, dad, gointer kill the fatted calf?”
DAD: “No, I won’t kill you, but I’ll make you work an’ get some of the fat
off you.”
“Furneaux” copped a puffin that was
about nine miles off what a puffin should
be, intelligently prepared for human con-
sumption. The Council now has among
its archives affidavits from members in
good standing to the effect (a) that the
mutton-bird is Australia’s choicest epi-
curean delicacy ; (b) that it is a staple
article of export, the fair fame of which
ought to be defended with horse, foot,
guns, navy and aircraft; (c) that Aus-
tralia could never have been successfully
colonised without it. So, please, no more
libels on Puffin.
* * * *
“Sowom”: The lady novelist who
would go diving, mentioned by “Beche-
de-mer” (B. 8/9/’33), recalls the enter-
prise of another literary lady (or perhaps
it was the same one) who went up the
Sepik River, N.G., to absorb local color
at a time when several of the tribes were
head-hunting. Orders had been issued
ihat the one and only passenger must
disembark at Marienberg. This did not
fit in with the lady’s plans, and when
the District Officer boarded the vessel on
sailing time she had retired to her cabin
and disrobed, and she stoutly refused to
move. As there was no other European
woman within six hundred miles, the ves-
sel proceeded up the river, the lady saw
all she wanted to, and the D.O. received
a reprimand for allowing her to remain
on board.
* # * #
“Hory”: A funny accident happened
to my old cow, which only goes to show
how good an old cow she is. Before the
accident not another soul but myself had
ever milked her. I'd brought her up
from a calf. Of course l milked her in
the ordinary way, one back teat, one
front, crosswise ; but the new rouseabout
tackled the two front teats first. Old
cow did her best, but how could
she help it? As he drained the
milk out of her for’ard hold she tipped
backwards, slow but sure. He didn't
notice her going at first, but all of a sud-
den she got a sort of a rush on, and over
she went, bellowing like mad, with front
legs waving in the air. We had to hoist
her up and ballast her neck while the
two back teats were milked.
* * * *
“Tiki”: The erection of a model of
Turi’s canoe Aotea on Patea Heads as a
monument to the Maori navigator was
a pakeha enterprise. The Maoris toler-
ated it much in the spirit of Seddon, who,
when asked by a reporter if he would
attend the funeral of that fine old Tory
Sir Harry Atkinson, said: “No, though
I hain’t got no hobjection to it.” But a
purely Maori memorial is going up. One
fine day Tahu Wiremu Ratana (the pro-
phet), who claims direct descent from
Turi, arrived at Patea with 60 devoted
adherents and materials for a camp. They
made straight for a spot which they
identified as the place where Turi built
a pah—Rangitawhi-te-wai-o-Turi. The
pah included Turi’s wharepuni, named
Matangirei, a spring, Pararakiteura, de-
scribed in the sailing directions Turi
brought with him from Hawaiki, and
a garden laid out by the second Mrs.
Turi (the one with whom Turi eloped),
whose name was Rongorongo-te-Keke-
keipapa, which may be interpreted, if
you so choose, as “the lady who cooked
and ate her father.” Ratana proposed
to build a replica of the pah, the whare
and the garden, and he was just start-
ing to put a theodolitical eye over the
site when there arrived a Mr. Ramsbot-
tom, representing a butchery co., Mr.
Ramsbottom’s solicitor, and the local
cop. The solicitor flourished a lease
showing that his client had a tenure of
the site. The cop said: “You can’t
camp here ; you’re trespassing.” Ratana,
like a second James Fitz James, said:
“Isn't it chilly, Dave? I’m simply FREEZINFG. Don't you feel cold over there?”
“Cold, y’ call it? It’s nothin’ to the weather we get sometimes.”
“This rock shall fly from its firm
base as soon as I”; and the pakeha
force retired with mental visions of
a Supreme Court injunction. It wasn’t
necessary. Next morning Ratana’s
man-of-law was in the solicitor’s
office full of tact and generosity.
If the butchery co. wanted land, let
it take choice of three far better areas
in the vicinity (titles produced) but
leave to the native race its ancestral Ply-
mouth Rock. Even butchery companies
are not devoid of sentiment, and Ratana
was left to carry out his plans. Patea
will see a pah that is a pah rising on
Turi’s first homestead. No saw, no
hammer will be used. But there won’t
be much “taihoa” about the building.
The place has to be ready on November
8, to coincide with the anniversary of
Ratana’s acceptance of the mantle of
prophecy.
* * * *
“Putiki”: M.L.’s unemployment-re-
lief schemes have their humorous side.
A recent case is that of a man physically
(and morally) incapable of work. The
foreman who had to engage him re-
quested him to keep out of the way.
But an hour later he found this chap
with a shovel. “I thought I told you
to leave hard work alone! ” the boss
growled. “I know,” was the response.
“But those other fellows have a shovel
to lean on, and why shouldn’t I?”
* * * *
“Nikko”: We trained our pup to be
useful; but it didn’t work. One of his
duties was to collect the evening paper
and bring it from the gate to the house.
Going for a stroll one Saturday even-
ing, Bingo noticed a paper lying on
a lawn. He had been given to
understand that all papers lying rolled
up on front gardens were the sole
property of his family, so he promptly
collected it. Trotting happily home
with his mouthful he was perturbed
to notice another paper tossed on
another lawn. It was hard work,
but after some moments he managed to
collect paper No. 2. Then the real
tragedy gaped, for almost every gate
in the street (a long one) was open,
and inside every one lay a twisted
paper. He solved the problem by dash-
ing home with them one at a time, and
dad, arriving from the races an hour
later, found our verandah littered with
sporting editions, while a proud but ex-
hausted pup awaited the word of praise
that didn’t come. Instead an agitated
paterfamilias, carrying a suitcase filled
with evening papers, sneaked up the road
and hurled one in at each open gate.
Even then two worthy citizens wrote
furiously to the papers about the preva-
lence of newspaper thieves.
* * * *
“Burl”: Waltzing Matilda in the way-
backs of S.A. 1 came upon upon a well-
found homestead —good water, yards all
trim and neat —set in a howling wilder-
ness of bare gibber plain, with not a
single head of stock in sight. The un-
fortunate owner, the only living thing
I saw there,, bar a snake, explained:
“When I came here it was nice and
green, like myself. Plenty of mulga, and
the well was a bonzer. I said to myself
‘l'll stock it with sheep, cattle and horses,
The sheep can graze round handy, the
bulls can go out a bit further, and the
horses can go clean out to the back
fence.’” “How did it work?” I asked,
“Work!” he snorted. “It didn’t work,
The sheep chopped up the country handy
to the well so badly that all the bulls got
sore-footed and wouldn’t—or couldn’t—
go out. They stayed near the house and
ate out the sheep, and then the whole
darned issue died on me.” “Stiff luck!”
I said, passing him the flybag, “but what
about the horses?” He looked quite
pleased with himself as he replied, “Ah,
well! They did work according to
schedule. The only trouble was they
went clean through the back fence.
Someone pinched the lot!”
* * * *
“C.P.C.”: It’s time to look out at
Denham Camp, Shark’s Bay (W.A.),
when the pogey pots are stirred up. The
smell of a flying-fox rookery is as violets
compared with a whiff from one of the
pots, into which are placed the live
Shark’s Bay pearlshells, which are much
smaller than Meleagrina margaritifera,
mainstay of the M.O.P. industry in more
northern waters. The shells, over a long
period, rot away to a putrescent mass,
which abos. stir round with waddies so
that the tiny pearls, if any, gravitate to
the bottom of the pots. Naturalist
Saville-Kent reckoned that a Shark’s
Bay pogey pot would give the two and
seventy stinks of Cologne a go for it.
* * * *
“Barangkali”: A shipment of rainbow
trout ova will be shortly sent to England
from M.L. In no wise astonishing nowa-
days ; still, many unsuccessful attempts
were made before trout were estab-
lished in Australasian waters. In 1848
the Tas. rivers were reported to be favor-
able for the stocking of salmon and
trout, and societies were formed with
this object in view. Experiments were
begun in 1852, but shipment after ship-
ment died on the voyage from Britain,
Finally, a consignment of ova, packed in
ice, left on the Norfolk in 1863, and
reached Port Phillip in 84 days. The
ova showed signs of life and they were
rushed across Bass Strait and placed in
fish ponds at Plenty. Over a thousand
hatched and the young fry made steady
progress. It was not until 1868 that
live ova reached Maoriland and were
hatched there with success.
“SWEET PRETTY CREATURE.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He perches on my window-sill
And plays about outside the door,
Or struts inside and cats his till
From crumbs I scatter on the floor:
A tiny being, full of airs;
A symphony in black and white;
A little rake, whose love affairs
Obtrude upon his rest at night.
Within a wilga close beside
My hut he sleeps when summer’s spent,
And, lover-like, as moonbeams glide
Around him, wakes to sentiment;
But only empty echoes greet
His sweet, seductive, wanton call;
“Sweet pretty creature!” “Creature sweet!”
Unheeded on the silence fall.
No need to search the earth and sky
To learn that spring is on its way:
I sec a sparkle in his eye
That tells me all he cannot say.
I wink at him, he flirts his tail
And shadow-spars, and ducks and swerves
About some visionary male
Who’s dared to poach on his preserves.
f miss him in the early spring,
But know I’ll not have long to wait
Before the shameless wretch will bring
Along his latest little mate;
And then, as April’s evening chill
Gives warning summer days have flown.
He’s back upon my window-sill,
Dejected-looking and —alone.
I wonder if he ever frets
Until his tiny heart is sore,
Or momentarily regrets
A past love he may meet no more.
“Sweet pretty creature! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet!”
Sounds sometimes almost like a sigh.
He dreams —of what? Of one he’ll meet
Or one to whom he bade good-bye?
QUEENSLAND.
MOROBE.


“Groper”: The first judicial hangings
in W.A. were those of two blacks, Dood-
jeep and Barralong, convicted of the
murder of Mrs. Cook and
her baby at York in May,
1839. The murderers were
identified by their foot-
prints and also by a broken
spear which they left be-
hind. For over a year they
were pursued, Governor
Hutt putting his foot down
on all suggestions for a
punitive expedition. Finally
Inspector Drummond
arrested the fugitives in the
mid&t of their tribe.
Brought to Perth they were
given a jury trial and found
guilty. Then, with grim
resolution, the settlers re-
turned them to York, 70
miles, chained in a cart and
with a file of soldiers as
escort. The tribes were
summoned and, when they
had gathered in their hun-
dreds, the two murderers
were hanged from the
bough of a big jarrah which
shadowed the doorway of
the house where the mur-
dered woman had lived.
As a moral lesson that hanging beat
indiscriminate shootings and punitive
expeditions' hollow.
*,* * *
“Scrub”: While a neighbor and I
were sinking holes for the stumps of a
building, a cow took to dining off the
freshly-turned, slightly damp, red vol-
canic soil, which old residents of our
district (N.Q.) say is poisonous. We
looked on aghast. But Penelope obvi-
ously relished the menu we had unwit-
tingly provided, and satisfaction beamed
from her large, soulful eyes. Mouthful
after mouthful disappeared, till at last,
realising that we would need that soil
to fill in with again, we lodged a pro-
test. Possibly the cow had a notion the
stuff was medically valuable.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: In a dog-dispute case in
a Sydney court claimant said he had lost
the dog on a certain date; defendant
said he had found it before that date
and had had it for 18 months. As the
dog threw no particular light on the
subject, being inclined to be friendly to
everybody, the S.M. was a puzzled Solo-
mon until claimant mentioned that
his dog had had its leg fractured in an
accident. Case was adjourned so that an
X-ray photograph could be taken ; and
when that was produced, showing the
mended fracture, judgment went to
claimant.
* * * *
“N.A.V.” (N. Rhodesia): Kapundi,
my African bush baby, is a species of
lemur. He is about three inches long,
grey and furry, a sort of vest-pocket
’possum, and makes a very entertaining
pet. His life work is the abolition of
mosquitoes, moths and flies. As a hobby
he drinks ; in fact, he gets squiffy every
night. He sleeps all day in the ceiling,
but, at dusk, punctually with the rattle
of the glasses, he arrives, and gets active.
After mopping up the dregs in the empty
tumblers and dipping into full ones of
the unwary, he proceeds with his big
turn. Head lolling drunkenly, forearms
loosely hanging, he cakewalks round the
tables, swinging carelessly between glasses
and Vases. He finishes with an engaging
display of long-jumping round the walls
via the picture-frames. Anything up to a
12-foot jump is simplicity to him in
sober hours. But when the wine is in he
as often as not misses his landing-ground
on the long hops, and his remarks,
addressed from the floor towards the
offending picture, are clearly of a bar-
rack-room flavor.
* * * *
“Wai-Hoi”: Those Timor ponies (B.
9/8/’33) date back to 1840, when the brig
Lulworth called at Port Essington with
livestock, including a draft of Timors.
Searcy’s mob, mentioned by “Übique,” is
nothing compared to the large mobs in
Arnhem Land. They’re wild little devils,
too, although Paddy Cahill, who started
Oenpelli on the Alligator River, now a
mission station, used to run them in when
he was a young fellow. Cop Playford,
Chief Warden in the N.T. for over 30
years, used to drive a pair of Timors round
Darwin. Bob MacDonald, of the abo.
compound at Myilly Point, sported an-
other pair, and the little rats smashed
things up more than once when Bob left
them in the care of an abo. whilst he
went to church.
••s * * *
“Raeakiaki”: The Maori jettisoned
the canoe sail shortly after his arrival
at Aotearoa ; its use off the rocky shores
of the Shaky Isles, with their erratic
breezes, represented a constant danger.
This early disuse accounts for the fact
“The new hand kissed me in the cowshed this morning.”
“I’ll have a word with him. He never asked for the time off.”
that only one specimen has been pre-
served. Ara kautu, it rests in the Brit-
ish Museum, though how it got there is
a mystery. Woven of narrow strips of
undressed flax or cabbage-tree, it is tri-
angular in shape, light but strong Four-
teen feet in length, it tapers from a width
of six feet to a bare foot, and has
attached to one side a tiny streamer,
not unlike a yachtsman’s pennant. Mast
and sail were hoisted together, the
former being part of the latter, and not
a permanent affair affixed to the canoe ;
it ran down one side of the sail, the
long base of which was hoisted upper-
most. Similar sails are found all over
the eastern Pacific, but the only other
type of sail known to the Maori sea-
farer, the ra kaupaparu, belonged, oddly
enough, to the western Pacific. It was
a true lateen, low slung, but no speci-
men of it has survived.
* * * *
“Emsworth”: Where did “Taniwha”
(B. 6/9/’33) get the idea that the
whanako spud has been longest at the
game? Maoriland’s first murphies didn’t
come from the Speck. Tradition credits
De Surville with their introduction in
1769, but though he certainly left behind
wheat, peas, rice, pigs and fowls, it’s a
10-to-l bet that the honor of introducing
the potato belongs to Du Fresne and Cro-
zet, who in 1772 planted spuds, wheat,
millet, maize and other European crops
at the Bay of Islands. The following year
Cook sowed spuds, beans, peas, radishes,
turnips, cabbages, carrots, onions, pars-
ley and Heaven only knows what else at
Queen Charlotte Sound. There’s ample
evidence that the spuds of Du Fresne and
Cook propagated and were carried into
distant parts of the Shaky Isles. When
Wellington was founded the Cook’s
Strait tribes had been cultivating the
spud for half a century.
* * * *
“Verri”: Another white rarity was to
be seen about Elizabeth Bay, Sydney,
some time ago, where a blue wren in-
cluded in his bevy of lady friends a tiny
white freak. She had a few flecks of
brown on her wings, but her impertinent
little tail was pure white. Sundry bird-
enthusiasts spent much time stalking her
with a view to capture, but she was still
with the family when they moved on to
new pastures.
* * sH *
“Eoee”: Tell “Plankton” (B. 30/8/’33)
he is not quite correct about ants having
no enmity to larvae that eat their ant-
grubs. The only butterfly larvae recorded
in Aussie guilty of this breach of con-
duct are those of the moth butterfly of
northern Queensland (Liphyra major),
which suck the juice from (not eat) the
larvae of the green tree ant, and have a
neat protective scheme. The butterfly, on
emerging, is covered with an outer layer
of sticky, creamy-white scales and a fussy
substance on the body ; these stick to the
feet and jaws of the ants, preventing
them from attacking. When the wings
spread and dry these scales fall off. Take
it from me, ants aren’t easily bluffed.
Also Ogyris zosine butterflies are not
small blues, as suggested by “Plank-
ton.” They have a wing-span of over
two and a half inches, and sugar-ants’
nests are specially built to admit the
larvae, about the same size.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: Eyre Peninsula (S.A.) is
busy with a sport new in those parts,
though not elsewhere—fox-whistling.
Bend over the lid of a tobacco-tin, punch
a hole in it, and blow; and the skilful can
get so near the shrill note of a trapped
rabbit that any fox within cover will
run up to be shot. A small minority
of farmers, however, say that the fox
does more good, in keeping the rabbits
down, than harm to lambs: “Since we
have been able to keep our sheep strong,
we have had no losses that way.”
“F.G.G.”: “Frigid” (B. 6/5/’33) is an
inch or two out when he says the 3ft.
3in. death-adder killed near Goondiwindi
(Q.) is the biggest on record. If the
figures on the specimen bottle are cor-
rect, the biggest to come under the rule
so far is in the School of Arts museum
at Bundaberg, which is credited with 3ft.
6|in.
* * * *
“C.P.C.”: Not many Australians know
that a rare, black kangaroo hops over
part of N. Aus. Jack Tunney got speci-
mens of it first in 1903, in rough country
along the South Alligator River in Arn-
hem Land. This jaunt of Tunney’s was
financed fifty-fifty by W.A. Museum
and Walter Rothschild, of Tring Park,
Hertfordshire, part of the arrangement
being that Rothschild should have the
privilege of describing scientifically any
new creatures discovered. Tunney got
five specimens of both sexes of a ’roo
unlike anything previously known. The
bucks were shining black and the. does
grey. The pelts of both varied consider-
ably with the seasons; in summer the
bucks turned a rusty black, whilst the
ladies wore light grey for winter and
swapped over to brownish-grey for the
hot months. The females, however, had
black snouts, paws and feet all the year
round. Only about a dozen specimens
have been taken altogether. Rothschild
mistook this stock marsupial for a cousin
of the tree-kangaroo und invented a
new generic name for it, Dendrolagus
wooclwardi, but Oldfield Thomas, of the
British Museum, proved! that the crea-
ture was a true ’roo. It was christened
Macropus bernardus, after old Bernard
H. Woodward, Director of the W.A.
Museum, who went aloft years ago.
Woodward, by the way, never quite for-
gave another Rothschild, Charles, the
flea expert, for naming a W.A. variety
of flea Pulex woodwardi.
Ht * * *
“Billy See”: Time brings some curious
revenges. In the early days of the
Westralian goldfields many a mine-
manager tipped his boiler cinders over
the tailings dump. Now these dumps,
although containing payable gold, are
worthless for retreatment because the
charcoal left in the cinders precipitates
the gold from the cyanide solution. So
far no method has been discovered
which will make the charcoal release its
grip or sort itself out so that it can be
got hold of and smelted.
❖ # * *
“C.S.”: “Cape Royal” (B. 13/9/’33) is
a bit out in his contention that the Mur-
rumbidgee lobster is the only cray in
Australia sporting large grasping claws.
Tassie produces a cray with these speci-
fications —the largest real crayfish in the
world, often growing to a length of
nearly 3ft. It is armed with a pair of
nippers the size of a man’s hand, capable
of exerting tremendous pressure.
* * * *
“Fitz.”: The ordinary everyday bush
magpie is a genius when it comes to
nest-building. Andrew Robinson, of
Wingham (N.S.W.), cut down a big gum-
tree on his place. Right in the topmost
fork of that tree was a magpies’ nest that
had evidently been there for years. Horse-
hair, feathers, soft bark strips, and other
fine stuff were in the nest proper ; but
the framework was of fencing-wire,
barbed wire, pieces of tin and so forth.
How the birds got the stiff wire into
position and shape that made it so ser-
viceable, lasting and safe is a matter for
speculation.
* * * *
“M.L.C.”: The Bavarian zoologist
Von Frisch, who has spent a lifetime
studying bees, has cleared up the dispute
among beekeepers as to whether it pays
to paint the hives to aid the bees to
distinguish them. Apparently it does ;
but only if the right colors are used, be-
cause the color sense of bees is limited.
They can distinguish black, white, yel-
low and blue, but red is outside their
range and they seldom visit flowers of
that hue. Neither can they distinguish
tints —yellowish green and orange are
alike to their eyes. Should a queen bee
mistake her hive on the return from
her marriage flight it is a serious matter,
for she will be killed and her own hive left
queenless. Bavarian monks who painted
their hives in accordance with these dis-
coveries report that in the following five
years they lost only three young queens,
whereas in the two previous years 16 had
been sacrificed through mistaking their
homes. Von Frisch has something new
to say, also, about the bee’s code of
communication and the honey dance.
A bee that has found a new and plentiful
source of honey returns laden to the
hive, and, picking out a crowded spot,
begins a peculiar dance, running to and
fro with rapid steps over the comb.
This creates excitement among the
workers, who crowd round and touch
her abdomen with their feelers. The
dance signals that nectar is abundant
and that the bees must hurry out and
gather it, but it gives no indication of
the direction. The scent of the flower
that the dancer was working, however,
clings to the long hairs of her abdomen,
and so the bees scout out in every
direction looking for flowers of that
sort.
* * * *
“W.P.”: Seaweed jelly, mentioned by
“Meat Preserver” (B. 23 / 8 / *33) as a M.L.
invention, is no stranger to Northern
Ireland. The weed is collected on the
coast, dried and shipped in big loose
bales to the weaving factories in Belfast.
I’m not going into trade secrets, but sea-
weed jelly is one of the reasons why
Belfast produces the best linen in the
world. When I was message boy in a
Belfast mill over 60 years ago there was
another seaweed sold in shops called
dulice, and lots of people bought it to
chew —a salt-flavored stuff. I’ve never
heard of it since.
LORDLUVADUCK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They christened him “Lordluvaduck" some
period in the long ago,
It being his own pet phrase, of course, that got
him tagged and labelled so.
For, whether he was pleased or narked, one
comment off his chest he’d chuck,
And one alone, in drought or flood, good times
or bad—“Lordluvaduck! ”
He used it quite impartially for both agreement
and dissent,
For non-committal attitude, for mild surprise or
deep content.
The news you brought, the word you said, might
leave him cold—or thunderstruck; •
But either way his formula would be the same
“Lordluvaduck! ”
The yarn you told him might be full of pep
and point, of up-to-mud,
A scintillating jeu d’esprit or an insufferable dud.
He’d one unvarying response as on his black-
ened pipe he’d suck,
And in his slow, delib’rate way ejaculate
“Lordluvaduck! ”
Some graceless Pommy asked him once if he
supposed the Lord displayed
More love (or less) for waterfowl than any
other things He made.
He gave him no reply from which a man
enlightenment might pluck
About the slogan’s inwardness; he simply
drawled “Lordluvaduck! ”
And when his earthly race is run and up the
golden stairs goes he
To take his chance, as all must do, where good
old Peter holds the key,
I doubt he’ll make a wordy fuss, whether it’s
in or out, his luck;
Whether the gate swings wide or clangs, he’ll
merely grunt “Lordluvaduck!”

- THE S.A.(F.P.)S. INTERVENES.
“It would be much .better for this body of
artistic special pleaders to go on with their
painting.”— J. S. Watkins, of the N.S.W. Art
Gallery., concerning letter-writing painters.
The Sydney Art (of Free Publicity)
Society held a meeting of protest against
Mr. Watkins’s unthinkable suggestion.
Mr. Titian J. Barrymore asked
heatedly how the public was to know
that such.artists themselves were alive ,
if they did not get letters'into the “S. M.
Herald” at short intervals. He had had
letters on the leader page of their great
publicity medium on paintings, parks,-
playgrounds, tattirig. woolwork, archi-
tecture, .samplers, etchings, metalwork,'
Masters (old, middle-aged .and new),
bridges, roads, culverts, viaducts and
many other subjects, relevant and other-
wise ; also 9.6. half-column letters about
the Gallery (hoots), and; its so-called
trustees, (groans) and 27 letters in praise
of the “S. M. Herald’s” art,criticisms.
A. G. Huie aside, he was, better known
among correspondence-fans than . any
free-publicity-seeker in the State. Was he
to' sacrifice his hard-won position for
painting?' . ‘ '
Mr. Velasquez C. Gable agreed with
every word uttered by the previous
speaker. n 1 Painting
was all very well.
But what was paint-
ing without publi-
city? (Cheers.) He
had painted hard
for half a lifetime
without selling; a
picture. One day he
conceived a' bright
idea: an attack on
the Gallery trustees.
He pointed out in a
letter to»the “S. M.
Herald” (cheers)
that ’Australian art
was bad ; that it
would never im-
prove till the trus-
tees (groans) gave.
Australian a r t i s t s
opportunities to see
foreign art; and -so
; he reached his point
—that ' the trustees
should- be dismissed
as * sufferers from
senility for not buy-
ing more Australian
pictures ; and. speci-
fically for. not buy-
ing more of his pic-
tures. His logic so.
impressed the public
that he was able to
stage ah exhibition
and to be . assessed
as an income-tax
payer that year for
the first time in his
life. (Cheers.)
Miss Rosa. Bonheur-Garbo subniitted
that the letter-writers - of the society,
while beyond praise as regards industry,
were still open to criticism in.the matter
of technique. They failed to realise the
important part, played by—er —jargon
in ifnpressing V.the public. She had
been distressed to * see letters which
contained, no references to “structural
rhythm,” “geometrisation of isomerism”
or “spiritual concepts.” One member
actually failed to exploit their venerable
favorite, “values.” (A voice: “Shame! ”)
She would suggest a closer study of
critical —er —gags on the part of mem-
bers. (Hear! Hear!) Patter. : was : —if
she might be permitted the vulgarism—
a winner. Every time. (Cheers.)
The meeting closed with a sharp vote
of censure on Mr. Watkins for his tact-
less behavior. ,

The black cat was asleep. Along came
a big flop-eared pointer, spotted the cat
through the Cyclone gate, and gave a'
deep, insulting' bark. The-cat' Woke up
and spat at him.
Musing on the worthlessness and im-
pudence of cats, the pointer tried to leap
the fence. The cat arched her back and
miaowed defiance. And now from the
back yard came a whirlwind of dog. An
Irish terrier, with snarling white teeth,
foaming lips and a lionlike roar. The
pointer suddenly heard a whistle from
afar. “That’s my boss,” he barked at
the terrier ; “otherwise T’d stay and" deal
with you.” ■ , TV'
So sayings he made for home at ter-
rific speed. And the cat, to whom the
railway engine’s whistle was as familiar
as it was to him, placed her tongue be-
“Me and me old man knows everything in the world.”
“ Yairs? Well, where’s Asia?”
“Ah, that’s one of the things me old man knows.”
tween her teeth and gave him a hearty
raspberry.

AND A LITTLE BRIDGE.
“South sees six trump tricks in his own hand,
a heart ruff in dummy. He needs one more
trick, which he must get on a squeeze.”
—Bridge expert.
But never forget that squeeze play calls
for caution. A premature squeeze often
proves fatal where the object of your
attentions isn’t a dummy and holds a
long club. 1
If you happen to be married and have
a good squeezing suit and a suspicious
wife ( a painfully common combination),
you should be careful ,to brush powder,
hairs, etc.,, off it before going home.
Better squeeze in different suits.
If you are a bachelor and find your-
self thinking hearts are trumps, give
away diamonds. The rest of the tricks
will be yours. After the parson has
taken a hand, you will find your partner,
leading a spade and telling you to do
your ruff stuff in the garden. Attempt to
reneg and you’ll get a slam.

DARN IT !
I darned her with fierce epithet ;
Hot anger whipped my tongue to
scorn.
She left me; now acute regret
Finds me alone and conscience-torn.
I darned her eyes, face, form and locks,
And ever since I’ve darned my socks!

ULTIMATUM.
May made me choose Itwixt her and beer.
It was extremely rough, on me,
But very resolute was she;.
She made her meaning crystal-clear. .
So now both May and I <tire, free :
She made me choose ’twixt her and beer.

THE REDUCING HABIT.
Said she, “My, figure is now slim
Where it was once — er — large,”
And gingerly she handed him, '
Careless of his appearance grim,
The hill for her massage.
His anguished eye the total sought,
His heart within him sank.
“Your slimming will reduce to nought
He shouted like a man distraught,
“My figure at the bank!”, .

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The committee of the historic Hawkes-
bury club was pleased with the attend-
ance at its meeting, and the bookmakers
were pleased with the results. Inflation
made another appearance, but had only
Grand Total and Princess Cistercian for
opponents in the Rowley Mile. He was
never off the bit to establish lmin.
39}sec., fast time for the course. He
started at 6 to 1 on, but paid 18s. for
10s. on the tote.
Albury owner-trainer Don Castle paid
an unsuccessful visit to Clarendon with
Snowfelt and Green Isle. Snowfelt
started at 5 to 4 for the Three-year-old
Handicap ; Green Island was well sup-
ported at tens for the Spring Handicap.
Snowfelt never travelled like a winner,
but Green Island, who made most of
the pace, ran fourth. In that handicap
Satmoth (evens) proved no match for
Love Song and Winrose. Love Song, a
stable-mate of Turbine and Oro, started
at sixes after fours had been taken early.
He got a lucky run on the false rail, and
this enabled him to beat Winrose, who
was forced wide at the top of the straight
when Green Island and Bridge and Bow
lugged out.
Maurice McCarten, who is at the head
of the jockeys’ list, rode two winners and

a third, and had only three mounts. He
was seen to advantage on the Derby can-
didate Waikare (2 to 1) in the Welter.
Waikare is by Limond —Waterwings.
When raced by the “Smithden” com-
bination, Questionnaire was speedy, but
could not stay. Since she was bought
by Mrs. Broadbent, wife of an aviator
who flew to the course, the Legionnaire
filly has been a model of consistency.
Starting at 3 to 1, Questionnaire won in
a walk from a hot favorite, Dame Moab,
who had run a fine trial at Warwick
Farm. Labor Girl was third, and
Elmaros, who may pick up a race pre-
sently, fourth.
* * * *
Given fine weather, secretary George
Rowe expects that the brighter economic
outlook will be reflected in the attend-
ance at the A.J.C. spring meeting, which
begins at Randwick on Saturday. Other
States and Maoriland will be well repre-
sented, particularly in the Derby, and
sportsmen from the Dominion over the
water are confident that Inflation will
lower the colors of Chatham in the
Epsom.
Booked to be retired to the stud last
season, Chatham has proved himself
better than ever. His recovery has been
a triumph for veterinary science and
for trainer Fred Williams. Last year he
won the mile with Bst. 131 b. from Rogilla
and Winooka, and despite his 9st. 101 b.
his owner, A. E. Blair, swears that if
the track is in good order his candidate
will score again. Still, there is that doubt
about the weather. It won’t affect Infla-
tion, who has Bst. A good four-year-
old cannot be overlooked, and Inflation
is not only a brilliant miler but is the
ideal horse to win the Epsom. When
he downed Turbine at Rosehill he beat
that good horse for pace and stamina
over seven furlongs; and there was not
the semblance of a fluke about the vic-
tory. Still, Turbine (Bst. 31b.) should
get a place and may win. Top Hole
(Bst. 41b.), Bold Boy (7st. 121 b.), Dermid
(Bst. 81b.), Care Free (7st. 51b) and Vista
(7st. 91b.) are smart gallopers, but they
don’t appear to be quite the class of
Inflation and Chatham. If Shakuni (7st.
101 b.) is reserved for the Epsom instead
of the Derby, he should give his backers
a capital run for their money.
Heroic won the Derby in 1924, after
a great finish with Nigger Minstrel and
Spearfelt. He is represented this year
by the handsome Hall Mark, whose two-
year-old deeds put him above the oppo-
sition. In some quarters it is contended
that Hall Mark will be troubled by his
Bst. 101 b., and that Blixten, who is
bigger and heavier than the Victorian,
will be suited by the conditions. Blix-
ten’s win in the Rosehill Guineas was
typical of the genuine stayer, but the
Derby is generally a muddling race, and
the Victorians are hopeful that Hall
Mark’s brilliancy will stand to him over
the last half-mile. Limarch has a
chance ; his trainer, J. T. Jamieson, has
already won Derbies —with Prince Hum-
phrey and Ammon Ra. The Victorian
Break Up will carry the colors of Phar
Lap. Deputy Ruler and he are both
to be respected on the score of their
defeat of Ammon Ra, Waltzing Lily
(now back in Melbourne), Topical and
co. in the Sir Herbert Maitland Stakes
at Victoria Park.
The Spring Stakes includes a number
of Metrop. fancies. Rogilla meets Topi-
cal on much better terms than in the big
race on Eight Hour Day, and the former
is expected to win, but Topical, with
Bst. 51b., should win the Metrop. Oro
(Bst.) and Maltdale (7st. 121 b.) may be his
most formidable opponents. Fancies:
First Brush Hurdle: Birthday Present;
next, Rosendo.
Trial Stakes: Broad Arrow ; next, Con-
fab.
Derby: Hall Mark, 1 ; Blixten, 2;
Limarch, 3.
Ensom: Inflation, 1 ; Chatham, 2 ;
Turbine, 3.
Spring Stakes: Rogilla ; next. Topical.
Kensington Handicap: Serabitc ; next,
Legislator.
Metropolitan: Topical, 1; Oro, 2;
Rogilla, 3
* # * *
The failure of Highway in the Men-
tone Handicap would appear to extin-
guish the Cup chance of that horse.
Odds of 6 to 4 were accepted about him
in a field of 11. Dark Man, owned by
Eric Connolly, and ridden by Ashley
Reed, swept along the rails to easy vic-
tory ; Highway, finishing on, defeated
Rex Aurantic on the post for third place.
Holt returned to Melbourne (he is
back in Sydney) for the purpose of sad-
dling-up Picatus and Casque d’Or for
their Mentone engagements. Picatus, not
greatly fancied, shaped generously for
Heather, and improved greatly on recent
efforts by coming second in the Men-
tone Handicap, a length and three-
quarters behind Dark Man. For the first
division of the Welter it would have been
hard to get any sort of a price about
Casque d’Or if the followers of Lou
Robertson’s stable had not stepped in
and backed Weatherwise from 7 to 1
down to 3 to 1. Casque d’Or squeezed
home by a head from a 10-to-l chance,
Eagle Eye, after a bitter struggle. Winner
clipped a quarter of a second off the
course record for seven furlongs, cover-
ing the distance in 1.26}.
Akanree (Comedy King—Lady Kath)
accounted for 22 rivals in the Mentone
Purse, for which he shared favoritism
with Woodhack at 8 to 1. Comedy King
died in 1929, so that Akanree must be
one of the last of his progeny. He be-
longs to J. L. Byrne, a wealthy English-
man who lives at Mornington. Akanree
has 6st. 101 b. in the Caulfield Cup and
41b. more in the Melbourne Cup. He
was only lately transferred to the stable
of George Tantram at Caulfield.
Henare, who might have won a Grand
National Hurdle had he remained sound,
has been patched up after a long spell.
Made favorite for the Brush Steeple at
Mentone, he fell before a round of the
course was completed. Victory went to
Salonia, who made a pleasing d£but over
fences. The Three-year-old Handicap
went to Beautiful Girl, while Simarre, a
five-year-old stallion by Moabite, took
the second division of the Welter Handi-
cap. Simarre is trained by Vin O’Neill,
who won a Melbourne Cup with Spear-
felt.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Real wrestling was provided by Muir
and Elliott at Leichhardt, and the change
from clowning to genuine grappling was
appreciated. Many attractive moves were
made by both before Muir submitted to
a crucifix hold in the second round.
Spectacular escapes from a great variety
of grips afterwards excited the boys out
back: Muir, with a short-arm scissors,
evened the falls in the fifth, and the Mel-
bourne Grammar School lad made the
sixth the speediest last round seen at
Leichhardt for some time. Elliott also
displayed plenty of celerity, but Muir’s
work in this round won him the de-
cision.
jhoolli* awl
Glorious weather favored the meeting
of Richmond and Geelong in the Vic.
League final on Saturday, and the 48,125
persons who parted with £2273 ss. lOd.
to watch it got full value. It was hard,
rugged, determined ; and more than one
hefty jab and neat uppercut found its
mark. When all was over no fewer thar
six Tigers and one Geelongite were
injured —with fractured collarbone, torn
muscles, cut heads and so forth ; also
umpire Blackburn found it expedient to
report three players. But the game was
exciting, and when at lemon-time Gee-
long led by 8 goals 11 behinds to Rich-
mond’s 7 goals 3, one sensed a whirling
finish. For the last term Doug. Strang
was brought back from the Richmond
full-forward position, where Todd had
kept him quiet, to the half-forward line,
the immediate result being 4 straight
goals from his boot. Geelong strove
valiantly and, had its forwards kicked as
straight as Doug, and his brother
Gordon, must have won ; failing, it went
down by 9 points—lo goals 14 behinds,
to Richmond’s 13 goals 5 behinds. The
Strangs, O’Halloran, Murdoch and
Hunter shone for the Tigers; for the
losers, Kuhlken, Collis, Les Hardiman
and Quinn did best.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Australian Rules premier-
ship ended in Sydney on Saturday with
a spectacular last-minute win by New-
town, which defeated South Sydney by
10 goals 3 behinds (63 points) to 7 goals
16 behinds (58 points). Scores were
50-31 against Newtown when the last
quarter began. A series of attacks
brought the leeway to 7 points with four
minutes to go. A behind and two goals,
the last just on the time bell, and a great
match was over.
* * * *
The Kangaroos continued their good
run in the North of England last week,
downing Lancashire at Warrington in a
mid-week game by 33-7, and getting the
better of a hard match with Wigan on
Saturday by 10-4 (2 tries and 2 goals
to 2 penalty goals). The game was
played in rain and the tourists’ perform-
ance in the wet was reassuring. They
have now won nine matches off the
reel and have two more club games be-
fore meeting the North <?f England side
in the first Test.
Ins and' Outs
The Board of Control met in Sydney
last week and arranged for getting the
Australian team off to Britain. The man-
ager will be Harold Bushby, of Tassie, a
Launceston barrister, who was chairman
of the board in 1919 and 1925-26. He
has first-hand experience of English
cricket and has not been associated with
the bodyline barge ; an excellent choice.
W. C. Bull, a Ma State delegate to the
board, will be treasurer. He has had
a long and notable connection with
cricket.
The manager is to receive a total
allowance of £650 and the treasurer £6OO.
Players will get £6OO in three payments
all in the currency of the country in which
they are dished out. The team is to
sail from Fremantle on March 26, and
arrive back at Melbourne on November
5. There will be 15 players, and the
selectors to choose them will be Billy
Woodfull, E. A. Dwyer and Dr. Dolling.
The new chairman is R. A. Oxlade, of
N.S.W., who held the job for three years
from 1927.
* # $ *
The faithful are reminded that the
cricket season is upon us. The Shield
matches open at Adelaide and Brisbane
on November 3, when South Aus. will
meet Victoria and Queensland N.S.W.
At Melbourne a game for the benefit ot
Blackie and Ironmonger will begin on
November 17, two picked Australian
sides competing. A similar show will be
staged in Sydney the following week.
Collins, Kellewav and Andrews being the
beneficiaries. Tests begin on June
(Notts), June 22 (Lord’s), July 6 (Man-
chester), July 20 (Leeds), August 18 (the
Oval). This last will be played out n
necessary. The others are four day
matches.

Ins and Outs
“Fitzcray”: Victoria is breathing
again. For a few dreary days it was
fearing the loss to its first-class cricket
of Fleetwood Smith, who, it is hoped,
will develop this season into another
Grimmett. F. Smith came to Melbourne
from Stawell, but was unable to find a
job. As departure for the bush meant
his dropping out of the game, members
of the M.C.C. hunted round and found
something for him to do which will
keep him in Yarraville. He will play
with M.C.C.
* * * *
“Old Trafford”: Freeman, of Kent,
did not quite get his 300 wickets this
season in pukka first-class games—he
was two short. Macaulay, of York-
shire, who was a failure in his
only Test essay in England, took 248,
and our old friend Verity 190. G. O.
Allen topped the bowling with an aver-
age of 9, but bagged only 13 wickets,
while Bowes gathered 159. Hammond
made 3323 runs, averaging 67.81. Mead,
who showed himself helpless against
Australian bowling with Chapman’s team
in Australian Tests, but has a better
record in England, scored 2576 runs,
averaging 67.78. Hobbs got 1105 in the
matches he played and averaged 61.38. He
intends to carry on with first-class cricket
until he gets his 200th century —he only
needs three more. With Larwood out,
English opinion sees nothing very hope-
ful in the way of bowlers for next year,
while it is generally accepted that Jar-
dine will not captain England this time.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The Melbourne Cricket
Ground trustees, who have already set
their confreres in Sydney a commendable
example in bringing accommodation up
to date, are going on with the work
to the end that the ground may hold
comfortably 100,000 people. The trus-
tees say that the complaints of the pub-
lic are giving them “serious concern,”
which shows that they must be unusual
trustees. But more land will be needed,
and it is proposed to get permission to
carve a narrow strip out of Yarra Park,
outside the present enclosure. This is
the cockroach in the beer.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: The first big cricket
Sydney will see this season will be the
Collins - Kelleway - Andrews testimonial
match, N.S.W. v. The Rest of Australia,
commencing November 24. Probable
that the Ma State selectors will confine
themselves to picking their own side, for
the Board of Control has been asked to
allow the Australian pea-pickers to sort
out The Rest.
* ifc * *
“Scared Stiff”: Just when we thought
we were getting back to the old peaceful
ways, another cricket threat is lifting its
head in the distance. An English
women’s cricket organisation has written
to its opposite number in Australia ask-
ing if a visit from a team to these shores
would be acceptable. Of recent years the
menfolk have made a sufficient mess of
these international “sporting” visits. One
trembles to think what would happen in
the case of the proposed flapper tour if
some regrettable contretemps arose. An-
other dispute over the admissibility of
—er — limb theory, for instance.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Spare Brummell”: One result of the
championships which will be welcomed
by all with a dislike of the bizarre is
the evident passing of plus fours. More
than one player reverted to flannel
breeks, and their example is likely to be
followed. Thirty years or so ago, when
golf began to reach the stage of an epi-
demic, most players wore trousers —the
professionals invariably—though some
amateurs affected the sightly knicker-
bockers used in those days by shooting
men and for country wear. Then plus
fours crept in gradually, until Harry
Vardon, greatly daring, became the first
pro. to affect them. Nowadays people
who couldn't tell a niblick from a caddie
sport them everywhere, and the end is in
sight.
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: Sydney witnessed yet
another golf championship last week,
the go for the assistant professionals’
title at Manly. The final was fought out
by K. Clark and A. C. Howard, the
former winning 6 up and 5 to play;
both are sons of former open champions.
* * * *
“Lakeside”: The American amateur
championship, won last year by the
Canuck Ross Somerville, came back to
Gahd’s Own Country last week, the
winner being George Dunlap, who re-
cently figured in the British open with
distinction, and whose chief sorrow in life
is reading his name spelt “Dunlop.” Play
was at Cincinnati, and the 24-year-old
winner was 6 up and 3 on his fellow-
American Max Marsden.
* * * *
“Susie Swattit”: Infant golfing phe-
nomenons are quite a commonplace
among the mere males nowadays, so it
is refreshing to hear of a female of the
species who shows good promise in the
same direction. This is Gwen Kershaw,
a 12-year-old associate member of Rich-
mond (N.S.W.) club. In company with
A. E. Boles, the damsel last week won
the open and closed mixed foursomes
championships of the Nepean (N.S.W.)
district on the Wallacia course. Another
distinction recently achieved by the
“Wot’s up with you? You’ve gotta bite!”
“Bite be blowed ! I’m coolin’ the beer!”
young lady was the securing of a hole in
one at Richmond. Whether or not the
usual ceremonial in connection with this
feat was observed has not been divulged
to the writer.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Bored stiff or moved
to pity by the continual wailings of
Queensland and Westralian golfers de-
sirous of having the Australian cham-
pionships held on local courses, the
A.G.C. has appointed Ivo Whitton a sort
of royal commission to report thereon.
There is jubilation in Banana- and
Groperland accordingly, but it is early
yet to build castles. Both the States con-
cerned are at opposite extremities of the
continent, and Westralia is particularly
removed. The cost to travelling golfers,
who pay their own expenses in the case
of amateurs, is heavy enough now when
Melbourne, Sydney or Adelaide is the
venue for the meeting. For the eastern
golfer the journey to the West is a long
and costly one, and vice versa.
Car and Cycle
“Fitzcray”: The dependability test run
held by the Australian Light Car Club in
Victoria was somewhat marred by
weather conditions. Chivalry also had
something to do with upsetting perform-
ances, for several competitors went to
the assistance of a woman driver who
had capsized her car, and forfeited their
chances. One of them, L. Pound, in a
Crossley, broke the ton miles per gallon
Australian record for cars up to 1400
c.c. in the C.O.R. petrol test, with 84.49
miles. This test started in Melbourne
and ended at Warrnambool, 160 miles
out.
* * * *
“Whizz”: Brooklands track saw its
third fatal accident within two days when
M. B. Watson’s car turned turtle while
travelling at 90 m.p.h. in the Brooklands
500. It burst into flames. Watson was
flung 20 yards with a fractured skull, and
was burned before he could be rescued,
dying in hospital. E. R. Hall won the
race in a M.G. Magnette with an average
of 106.53 m.p.h. It is becoming a ques-
tion whether the English track, built
years ago, has not now become too
dangerous for modern high speeds.
* * * *
“Chain Drive”: That motor-cycle spin
from Melbourne to Sydney (B. 30/9/’33)
was repeated the reverse way by one of
the riders in the first contest, Armfield.
The ride was under the same conditions
as the first, in sealed top gear and with
economy the guiding principle. Arm-
field’s riding costs for the double trip
totalled 10s. and the mileage was
222.5 m.p.g. of petrol. Lubrication took
only 2 2-3 pints of oil.
* * * *
“Kick Starter”: It is possible that the
Australian Tourist Trophy motor-cycle
event may not be held as usual on Phillip
Island (Vic.) early next year as intended.
Arrangements had been made to hold
the race as part of the centenary cele-
brations, and some of Europe’s leading
riders have been invited. The event may
now be postponed until 1935, the Auto-
cycle Union having reason to think that
increased financial assistance may be
forthcoming if the race is held that year
—hardly a sportsmanlike reason for put-
ting off so important a fixture.
* * * *
“Sandgate”: Motor-cyclists in Queens-
land have been knocked galley-west by
the decision of the Waterford Shire Coun-
cil to close the Kingston-road circuit,
on which all important motor-cycling
events in the State have been run
for some time. Arrangements were all
made for the State Grand Prix on the
course next month, and there is no time
to look for a new circuit if the coun-
cil’s flinty heart doesn’t change. Further,
the Kingston circuit was the State’s best
asset in claiming an Australian T.T.
meeting, and now that hope will be
wrecked also. The council objects to
being held responsible for accidents to
those using the road circuit for every-
day purposes from racing or training
cyclists, and till the racing folk safeguard
them in this respect the ban must stand.
Racquet and Baw!
“Cut Shot”: “L'Auto” has issued its
ranking list. Tt is Crawford, Perry, Cochet,
Vines, Austin, Satoh, Shields and Stoef-
fen. Britons will cavil at the placing of
Austin fifth, but the French never had
much time for the young gentleman and
his shorts, apart from his tennis ability.
Otherwise it is not easy to find fault with
the ratings.
* * * *
Dr. A. C. Curtis, whose death occurred
last week, was one of the leading N. S.
Wales lawn tennis players in his day, and
a notable cricketer to boot. 11l health
took him out of the game early, about
his last important appearance being with
A. R. Taylor, when the pair won the
South Australian doubles in 1907. His
best period was in the ’nineties, among
his successes being the Queensland
doubles with D. S. (now Judge) Edwards.
He represented N.S.W. in 1897, and
though he was the last man selected for
the State team won the singles cham-
pionship. As a cricketer Dr. Curtis was
prominent with the University and Syd-
ney clubs.
Miscellaneous
“Cowe”: The magic of curling was
never better exemplified than in Mel-
bourne last week. For days the Pres-
byterian Assembly had been a Scottish
Donnybrook. Some wise buckie suggested
a curling match at Melbourne Glaci-
arium, and there the antagonists of the
Assembly met to the music of the bag-
pipes and buried all animosity, for the
time being at least, in the amenities of
the roaring game. Many of the players
were Scots who were playing their first
game out of their native land.
* * * *
“Green Chequer”: Pigeon-flying his-
tory was made in N.S.W. the other day,
when a Wagga bird homed in a race
from Mungindi, 429 miles, at the rate
of 1772.7 yards a minute. The bird is
owned and bred by H. E. Gissing, presi-
dent of the Wagga Homer Club. The
performance must be something like a
world’s record, though there are no offi-
cial records to compare with it. In any
case there must have been a strong fol-
lowing wind, as the rates of the second,
third and fourth birds, 1772.2, 1764 and
1756 yards respectively, indicate. On the
other hand, it is stated the birds wasted
15 minutes circling at Mungindi when
released, before taking their line.

“Blade”: N.S.W. may send an eight
to M.L. this season. Maoriland also
asks for a sculler, and it is hoped that
the men may be across the Tasman in
time to take part in the Shivery Isles
championships. N.S.W. is due to defend
the King's Cup in Tasmania in May, but
is anxious to return the visit of the All
Blacks here in 1925.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: It is possible that Aus-
tralia may see the American negro
sprinter Eddie Tolan before long. Tolan’s
specialty is the 100 metres, his only
world’s record being his 10 l-ssec. over
that distance. At the last Olympiad,
however, he won the 100 and 200 metres
in 10 3-10 sec. and 21 2-10 sec. respec-
tively.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
Nq; 8.
Royal Sydney Impressions.
Royal Sydney once travelled under an
alias. It began as the Sydney G.C.,
almost 40 years ago to day.
Like more than one contemporary, it
sprang from the golfing community
which used to foregather on the links
made available at Concord by Dame
Eadith Walker. Then links were bought
at Bondi in 1896. They were used by the
club until 1899, as well as the Concord
course, until Sydney G.C.—now, by
favor of Queen Victoria, Royal Sydney—
presented the Concord club with all its
possessions in that region, save its golf
balls and whisky, and took up its abode
definitely in the Eastern Suburbs.
The first clubhouse at Bondi was on
the eastern side of the Old South Head-
road, and was later abandoned for one
on the corner of O’Sullivan-road. In
1904 a third was built on the site of the
present; this was destroyed by fire
in 1920. The following year the present
splendid building was completed and
occupied.
The links consist of a championship
course of 6310 yards over 18 holes and
a short 18-holer. There are, in addition,
25 tennis courts, 2 squash-racket courts,
bowling-greens and croquet lawns.
Membership totals 2658. Of these 13
are life members, 550 full, 240 pro-
visional, 415 country, 50 junior, 1014
associate and 376 ranked as non-playing,
The long procession opens with J. L.
Hey worth, who is seen here flashing a
characteristic smile for Frith. He is a
useful golfer on the 17 mark, and off the
links fills in his spare time with Lever
Bros.
Count Moltke, in the second place,
and looking as if he didn’t care a hang
where that one went, is one of the
steadiest dispensers of gift balls to his
fellow clubmen at week-ends, though his
losses never cause him to economise on
his perpetual cigarettes. He is Vice-
Consul for Denmark when not engaged
in the more serious problems of the put-
ting green.
In third place is E. T. Simpson, a
clever performer off the 8 mark. He is
practically a child of the regiment, his
father, the late E. P. Simpson, having
been for many years president and cap-
tain of the club. The fourth figure, with
the striking check effect, is Justice
Milner Stephen. He is the club’s handi-
capper and apt to be severe on long-
markers who turn in low scores. Dr. R.
Worrall appears next, in the Tom Mix
hat. Whether he is dropping the ball in
or taking it out of the pot is left to the
imagination of the beholder. Sixth
comes Dr. Reg Bettington, State and
Australian amateur champion last year
and an old Oxford Rugby and cricket
Blue.
Noel Heath is seventh. He is the
club’s squash-rackets champion and a
good tennis player. Golf also engages
his attention. The imperturbable presence
who follows on is D. L. Dowdell, gen-
eral manager in Australia of the Orient
Co. and a connoisseur of bowls in his
spare time at the club. Ninth is H. M.
Cutler, who is one of the club’s leading
players, with a place on the 7 mark. He
also is a medicine man, specialising in
X-ray work.
The knight of the cheerful coun-
tenance who is numbered 10 is the
club’s captain, C. W. Rundle. He is an
ideal host, a keen worker on the
committee and a formidable opponent
off the 7 mark. He is a solicitor, con-
nected with Norton, Smith and Co.
No. 11 is secretary R. T. Coulson. He
golfs from the middle mark when he has
time, and has just returned from a ’bus-
man’s holiday in Melbourne at the Aus-
tralian championships. E. Read, who fol-
lows his secretary, is a Sydney solicitor,
He is an habitual week-ender and plays
off the 12 mark. R. L. Sayers, better
known to his clubmates as. “Tin Hat':
Sayers, is on the Sydney Stock Exchange.
As a golfer he is a notable long-distance
smiter.
No. 14 is W. A. Anderson. He
plays off the 18 mark, and is a tough cus-
tomer in four-ballers, to which he is much
addicted. On his heels follows H. A.
Money, full of blissful expectancy, as
his picture shows. He is one of the
younger members of the club, and is a
keen squash player. “H.A.” is inter-
ested in the coal industry.
Tall and serious is P. Meagher,
senior, who is reputed to have played
golf since the new links were laid out
by Noah at Ararat. He is a deadly hand
on the putting-green. G. H. Patter-
son, No. 17, is a fast-improving player
whose handicap is dropping like the mer-
cury in a Sydney spring. Released from
golf, he finds solace in advertising. W.
G. de Gruchy is so devoted to golf that
he sleeps on the job, residing at the club-
house and getting up at dawn to keep
the worms from trampling the greens.
He is a shipping personality, being
director in N.S.W. of the Commonwealth
and Dominion line.
Nineteenth is the svelte and affable
F. G. Murdoch, one of the Ma State’s
leading golfers, and captain of the club’s
A-grade team off the 3 mark. He won
the Victorian amateur championship as
long ago as 1912, but doesn’t look it.
He is another shipping mandarin, con-
nected with Gibbs, Bright. No. 20 ticks
off R. M. Scott, an energetic committee-
man, and a good golfer from the 8 mark.
He is also hard to best in the billiard-
room, and in town is interested in the
motor trade.
The modest-looking young man at
21 is D. Williams, who is a barrister
when pursuing a crust. He is another
of the week-end regulars, and as a golfer
spends most of his time on the club
tennis courts. General Alex. Jobson is
next in line. He plays off . the 24 mark,'
but is a useful four-ball addict. An
accountant, he commanded the 9th In-
fantry Brigade in the war.
At 23 we see C. H. Fawcett, another
of Australia’s leading players, and for
the past five years club champion. He
has a great record in big golf, and with
A. W. Jackson, of Victoria, won the
Australian foursomes in Melbourne the
other day. Then comes H. S. Lloyd on
24. He is another of the club’s stock-
and sharebroking members, and is a
good left-hand performer with a 12 han-
dicap.
Allan Lewis is the next to make
his bow. He is a reliable middle-marker,
and one of the chiefs of Concrete Con-
structions, among his responsibilities
being the “Sun” and Government Savings
Bank buildings in Sydney. Wondering
if Frith is going to do a nice one of him
is B. E. Grant. He is one of the young
brigade, and on the 12 mark is showing
well in competitions. He also is con-
nected with the Stock Exchange. D. L.
Davies, tall and willowy, is another of
the club juveniles. He is playing off 19
at present, but nurses hopes of better
things.
Closing the crowded galaxy comes
G. B. Lindeman. He is a medico, and
a member of the famous wine family.
He is one of the club’s all-rounders, play-
ing golf and tennis with equal skill.
“Wingy”: One of Britain’s most inter-
esting fixtures is the championship for
one-armed golfers. This year 37 players
took part in a 36-hole go, the winner
being W. R. Thompson, who was
wounded in both arms during the
war. One was rendered useless. All
the same he returned a card of 169, and
his game included a drive of 262 yards.
A good many players with two good
arms would be considerably bucked if
they could do either and average 4.7
strokes per hole for two full rounds.


THE MAM
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MECGITT'S LIHSEED MEAL
NEED FOR MEAT INSPECTION.
“Meatpreserver”: Systematic meat in-
spection in country districts should be
insisted on. In N.S.W. an inexperienced
police officer or health inspector con-
ducts a cursory ante-mortem inspection.
The beast is slaughtered and submitted
for sale. Cattle slaughtered in public
abattoirs or meatworks are subjected to
rigorous ante-mortem inspection, yet the
experienced Government inspectors con-
demn, or partially condemn, many
yearly. A beast may be reeking with
T. 8., yet appear in perfect condition be-
fore slaughter. In a case of pleuro, the
affected organs may be destroyed by un-
scrupulous slaughtermen. Actinomycosis,
or lumpy jaw, when deeply seated, will
frequently defy ante-mortem detection.
On the other hand, a beast with a local-
ised simple abscess is often rejected.
[The foregoing is correct. With the
exception of all stock slaughtered in
the Sydney metropolitan, Newcastle and
Broken Hill abattoir areas, at the Aber-
deen (N.S.W.) works and a few other
small plants where meat is being ex-
ported or coming into the metropolitan
area, there is no proper • inspection.
Neither police officers nor health inspec-
tors are qualified meat inspectors, and
only occasionally are they present dur-
ing slaughter. It should be compulsory
for public abattoirs to be erected in any
country town with 5000 people and a
meat inspector appointed to supervise the
slaughtering, prevent the distribution of
diseased meat, control the sanitation of
the premises, inspect the waggons in
which the carcasses are conveyed and pre-
vent any unnecessary cruelty to animals
during slaughter. In any Maoriland
town of over 3000 population there must
be a public abattoir.
It is impossible for a clever vet. to
detect even 30 p.c. of the cases of dis-
eased stock from ante-mortem examina-
tion. Stock are inspected at Flemington
by specially trained and experienced in-
spectors, yet 70 p.c. of stock condemned
wholly or partly pass ante-mortem ex-
amination, and are condemned in post-
mortem. What chance has an untrained
officer to deal with the matter?]
THE AMATEUR GRINDER.
“Lion”: I have read the remarks of
“Liss” (B. 12/7/’33) and “Beckton’s”
reply (B. 9/8/’33) on the proper way to
grind combs and cutters. I follow “Beck-
ton’s” method in making up the discs.
If the laps are green they soon become
useless. They don’t give such a keen
edge as the dry ones.
Re the actual hanging of the pendu-
lum, “Liss’s” method was recommended
by the Graziers’ Co-operative Shearing
Co., Ltd., in a booklet issued for private
circulation only. It is worth getting.
I am using this method at present. The
shearers are all satisfied, in spite of being
in hard-cutting sheep. An emery or car-
borundum lap can be freshened up by
wiping the lap at full speed with the
tips of some broken comb ; but use care
when doing it, not pressing on the comb
too hard ; and also see there is no rake
tooth left in the comb. Grind this off
first.
A man must cultivate the right
touch and feel before he can grind
properly. Nothing that is written can
help him. He must have the experience.
TURNIPS AND WINTER
FATTENING.
“J.W.W.”: There are many ways of
conserving winter fodder. James Woods,
of the Moondarra district (Vic.), believes
in first growing White Stone turnips,
with swedes to follow, as a fodder for
topping off sheep in winter.
During last winter he fallowed eight
acres. In early April he sowed White
Stone turnips in three acres and swedes
in five acres, his idea being that the
swedes would be ready by the time the
White Stones were done. The season
was very dry and the rain late, but both
turnips and swedes got a simultaneous
start.
In the first week of July he put 250
sheep into the White Stones; they ate
it out in about two weeks. Then he put
them into the swedes, which, though still
on the young side, were large and very
tender. At the rate of 50 sheep to the
acre the swedes lasted them over four
weeks, by which time they were fit tor
market after a very cold winter. Mr.
Woods (a judge at Melbourne Show)
thinks he can better this in a more favor-
able season.
“MORE PER ACRE.”
“The Chiel”: High production costs,
low prices and overseas competition
render it imperative for the Australian
pastoralist and dairy-farmer to make
every acre produce its maximum.
Only in recent years has agricultural
science given to grass the attention and
study which its importance warrants.
Five years ago Lord Bledisloe, Maori-
land’s Governor-General, said to the Brit-
ish Association at Glasgow: “Just as
the eighteenth century is associated with
a progressive revolution in arable hus-
bandry, and the nineteenth with a similar
leap forward in animal husbandry, so the
twentieth century seems calculated to
rank in history as affecting a like revolu-
tion in grassland husbandry.”
The truth of this statement is apparent
in the present world-wide movement in
the direction of pasture improvement.
The movement has a special significance
for Australia. It is from grass that our
greatest wealth is derived. For years our
grasslands have had to produce this
wealth with little assistance ift maintain-
ing their nutrients or feeding value.
Australia must become “grass-
minded.” Pastoralists and dairy-farmers
must realise that grass is a crop. If it
is to give maximum results, it requires
the same study and care that the wheat-
grower gives to his wheat crop and the
orchardist to his fruit trees. Australia
has done much to improve the standard
of flocks and herds so as to produce more
and better wool, meat and butter ; but,
so far, comparatively little attention has
been given to the improvement of grass-
lands.
However, the movement is “catching
on,” and some of the results are astonish-
ing. Hundred per cent, increases per
acre are not uncommon. These have
been achieved, not on small experimental
plots, but on whole farms.
Australia has soil and climatic condi-
tions equal to anything in the world.
She must get into the forefront of this
great pasture-improvement movement if
she is to maintain her place as a primary
producing country.
BACON-CURING.
“Eirwal”: Farm bacon-curing is dif-
ferent from factory-curing. The ideal
temperature is about 42deg. F., but, as
this is not always available on a farm,
curing is best done in the winter months.
Keep the following points in mind:
(1) Pig should be healthy and well rested
and starved for 24 hours. (2) Commence
curing 24 hours after slaughter. (3) Be
clean in all operations. (4) Keep carcass
where cold dry air can circulate. Cut
the carcass after it is bled and scalded at
a temperature of 150-160 deg. F. First
remove the head and feet and then split
the carcass down the back. Divide the
side into shoulder, middle and ham.
The following will give good results:
91b. salt, 51b. sugar, fib. ground allspice,
fib. ground saltpetre. Release the joint-
oil with a sharp-pointed knife. Lay the
pieces flesh side up and sprinkle them
with equal parts of salt and saltpetre.
Allow them to stand for 24 hours. This
will draw off the surface blood and help
to retain the color of the meat. Next
apply the curing mixture and stack the
sides. Then restack them differently
every day for a fortnight. By this method
curing takes three to four weeks. Then
soak them for 8-12 hours in clean water;
dry, and leave them in a smoke-house
for 24-48 hours. Rub lightly with olive
oil.
BOXED LAMBS AND EWES.
“Lion”: When ewes with young lambs
get hopelessly boxed, many people are
puzzled. This method will soon sort them
out while you sleep. Choose two small
paddocks divided by a, plain wire fence.
Divide the mob in two and put half in
each paddock. Then move the two bot-
tom wires and the drafting will be done
overnight by the ewes themselves. See
that only enough wires are removed to
allow enough room for a lamb only to
pass underneath.
If there are definite earmarks in the
two mobs, draft the ewes first by ear-
mark, letting the lambs go with them as
they draw up the race ; then put them in
the prepared paddocks.
BALE WEIGHTS.
“Lion”: Wool can be evenly pressed
without scales. We tried it last year with
success.
We put up a 17-bale line of AAAE for
that portion of the clip ; our bales never
varied more than 151 b., some weighing
exactly the same and some within a
pound of each other, with the 17th bale
excepted. The bale was fitted into the
press exactly the same depth each time.
Both boxes were filled to the top and
trodden to the utmost. They were both
again filled to the top and again trodden,
and then just filled up tight and pressed
down. They were trodden till tight all
round.
It worked splendidly—no counting of
fleeces or armfuls, yet wonderfully even
weights as a result. As long as the same
man treads the wool the result will come
very near. He must not tread one bale
more often than any other or it will
press heavier.
An owner understanding his business
should be able to put his own clip up.
If it is put up honestly and the lines are
left at the level first started, i.e., no
“forcing,” then the buyers get to know
the station brand and look for it.
I consider this better than any classer’s
identification, for it means they know
the type of wool selling under that brand.
BEST FOWL ROOSTS.
“A.C.8.”: If fowl-perches are hung by
wire from the roof the birds can be more
easily kept free of vermin. Fencing-wire
makes good loops. The battens will lie
in the loops firmly if a slight indenta-
tion is made with a file. To clean perches
take them down and treat them with
sump oil or kerosene. Swinging roosts
make the birds grip the perches with their
feet and not rest the weight of their
bodies on the breast-bone, which gives
them crooked breasts. Rats cannot
travel down the wire or reach the roosts,
either. Birds that roost in trees never
suffer from crooked breastbones, as they
use their leg muscles to grip the bough.
With fixed perches fowls gradually lose
the use of their leg muscles, and some-
times, when sleeping, fall and break their
legs,
MINERAL-DEFICIENCY DISEASES.
“Malvern”: “Bahb Dwyer” hits the
nail on the head (B. 30/8/’33) when he
says mineral-deficiency diseases may be
due to lack of digestible proteins.
Mineral deficiency may be corrected
by giving a balance of the proper grasses
and meals.

This table shows the lime contents of
hays and the phosphorus content of
meals.
Sheep put into good feed have very
little need for a mineralised lick, except-
ing salt, iodine or magnesium, to coun-
teract bloat and indigestion. In fact, loz.
of iodine of potash to lcwt. of salt is
all that is necessary to increase digesti-
bility of proteins and prevent indigestion.
Salt is not good for ewes when suckling
their lambs.
LIMING LAND.
“Thorley”: “B. Ware” (B. 23/8/’33)
says lime in Vic. is 12s. 6d. per ton,
Where? I know it is quoted at £2, and
that a farmer bought burnt lime at 9s.
per cwt. bag for experimental purposes.
Fineness of grinding is an advantage.
In ancient times labor was cheap, and,
by applying lime, crops or pastures were
improved. The lime acted upon plant
foods in the soil and made them more
readily available to the plant. But new
ground has been broken. Much has
been done with draining and green
manuring, particularly by growing
legumes.
Good fertilisers play a big part in suc-
cessful farming now. They ensure a
sufficiency of all plant foods required.
Our soils are generally poor in available
phosphates. We bank on superphos-
phate, but small quantities of nitrogenous
or potassic manures may be necessary
to ensure bumper crops. Experiments
with these may be made at little cost;
lime in limited quantities might be tried.
Storer says: “Lime is a substance that
can no more be spared than potash or
magnesia or phosphoric acid. But insofar
as the immediate requirements of plants
in this sense are concerned, a few pounds
of any lime compound to the acre would
satisfy them.
“B. Ware” says to apply tons to the
acre to improve the pasture. He would
force us into the Insolvency Court.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Wrash”: During the spring months
watch for bots. Smear eggs attached to
the hair of a horse’s coat with a mix-
ture of two parts raw linseed oil 1 and one
part kerosene. One application will de-
stroy the larvae, and prevent. another
strike for some days.
“Pine Scrub”: To deal with “set-fasts,”
or persistent sore backs on horses, rub
into the affected part, for five to ten
minutes, a good blistering ointment, and
give prad a spell for four or five weeks.
He will then stand the saddle without
chafing.
“Murrawong”: When sheep leave the
hands full of burrs, thorns or grass-seeds,
keep an old shearing cutter handy ; it
extracts better than either needle or knife.
Thread a piece of string through an eye
and clean the cutter thoroughly in boil-
ing water or disinfectant.
“Yakhai”: Jetting sheep is not always
carried out properly. Sheep should be
cool and be kept in the shade as much
as possible ; a cage in the shed, attached
to the end of the catching pens, is suit-
able for jetting in ; the drainage may
be caught and used again. Strictly super-
vise pressure. Do not use enough to
bruise the animal. Bruised skin absorbs
the poison content.
“Deekay”: To make old ploughshares
wear longer, weld an inch of old file to
the bottom side of the point. Bring the
two to welding heat at the same time
and tap lightly together.
“Mulgo”: Before you erect wooden
buildings see there are no old stumps or
roots about, harboring white ants. Plough
the ground deeply as a precautionary
measure on land that has been cleared
of timber.
“Tena”: To destroy moths in the
orchard suspend by wire an earthenware
pot or large pudding basin 18 inches be-
low the limb of a tree. Place an eight-
inch tin plate between wire, about six
inches above pot. Bait these traps with
a mixture of one part molasses to 15
parts water. Any fermented fruit juice
is also good bait. Clean traps twice
weekly.
“Painter”: In painting roofs remember
that iron is non-absorbent. The brush
should carry very little paint. Give the
coating quickly and do not try to
“work” it as you do with wood. The
light coating gives the proper “face.” A
roof or wall of iron needs about one-
third of the paint needed for anything
else. Wipe the iron before painting to
remove any acid formations.
“Bufforp”: Plant all the sunflowers
you can this season. The heavy seed-
heads provide grain for the fowls. The
oil helps them in the moulting process.
Seed is easily crushed, provides fat-
tening meal for pigs and a milk-produc-
ing ration for the milkers. The plant, if
cut green with the leaf on, makes A 1
silage, or, when dry, clean stock bedding.
“Tamornie”: To check the fencing in-
clinations of bulls, take two pieces of
6-gauge galvanised wire, about 21 in.
long ; bend them in the middle and bring
the ends together. Turn these ends out-
ward like hooks, Hin. long; lay pieces
together so that the hooks form a grap-
nel. Bind with light wire, secure with a
touch of solder and suspend from the
nose-ring. After the bull has been
attached to the fence once or twice and
allowed to remain there for the day, he
is very chary about approaching it again.
“Lion”: We bought a horse seem-
ingly in perfect order. It was ridden, and
often driven in a sulky, pulling quite
heavy loads. One day it went lame. We
bathed the leg and shoulder with hot
foments, and at last detected signs of in-
flammation in the shoulder. Presently
an abscess formed. We lanced it and
extracted a piece of yellow boxwood
which measured 4in. long, ljin. wide and
|in. thick. The horse rapidly recovered.
At some time in its life it must have
been badly staked, yet not badly enough
to leave any visible scar. It carried this
huge lump of wood between the ribs and
shoulder-blade for two years.
“The Breaker”: When “doctoring” a
colt get him down and up again quickly.
Undue straining may have fatal effects.
After head-roping, tighten front- and
hind-leg ropes, and use a loin-rope. The
hind-leg rope can be used if the colt s
head is firmly held to prevent it getting
up. Loosen this rope, and pass the free
end of it beneath the leg-roped front leg :
by exerting pressure, pull it beneath the
colt’s body until it is well across the
loins. Then, with a half-hitch, secure
the colt’s free hind leg, leaving a couple
of feet space between both hind legs.
By pulling on the rope the colt will then
be turned on its back at a suitable angle.
Use plenty of olive or castor oil or
melted fat and kerosene mixed ; have a
sharp knife which has been dipped in
antiseptic. Do the job quickly, and
don’t pull when searing off. Wash the
wounds with an antiseptic and then oil.

The greatest shaving fallacy is " l l||
to imagine that the cheapest ill

that matters. Try one of the i

the past two summers OMNIS 1 Ad-controlled
refrigerating plants driven by petrol engines
have been giving trouble-free service in N.S.W.
and Queensland. The engine is started auto-
matically whenever the temperature in the
cool-room rises above a predetermined safe-
point and is stopped again when the tempera-
p ture has been sufficiently reduced.

Wheat Quotas
“Rey”: The International Wheat Ad-
visory Committee has finished its first
meeting. It will not meet again until
November 27. It would have done
better service if it had paid more careful
attention to removing Government
bounties on and artificial obstacles against
the importation of wheat into European
countries instead of concentrating, as it
did mostly, on the positions of the ex-
porting countries.
* * * *
French and German consumers are
paying about 7s. 6d. a bushel for wheat
grown in their own countries, because
of tariffs and bounties. The biggest pro-
blem facing the world wheat industry is
not limitation of production so much as
the need for increased consumption. This
is where the committee has failed. Last
week’s cables mentioned that the con-
sumption of wheat in France had de-
creased from 312,000,000 bushels to
286,000,000 bushels since 1913, during
which period the population increased by
3,000,000. In Germany wheat consump-
tion decreased by 30,000,000 bushels last
year as compared with the previous year.
France totally prohibits importation of
wheat, and this year has a surplus pro-
duction for export. Germany allows a
quota of 3 p.c. imports, which pays a
duty of 300 per cent. Hence the high
cost of wheat in these countries.
* * * *
The piling up of big surpluses in
Canada and U.S.A. is a result of Govern-
ment interference. U.S.A. created a Farm
Board, which bought the growers’ wheat
to arrest a fall in prices. At the same
time, the Canadian pools, backed by
their various Governments, did the same
thing. Australia, on the other hand,
faced the situation and sold on the low
market prevailing. Her carryover is
not an embarrassment. The same applies
to her wool, which she cleared at low
prices. Now, because there is no wool
carryover, the best prices for many
years are being obtained. U.S.A. and
Canada still have their wheat surpluses
on their hands, to the detriment of the
industry. However, the committee has
adjusted quotas for reduction of output
by wheat-exporting countries.
He * * *
Many Continental countries have fallen
in with the idea of reducing production.
It would be interesting to learn the
method which they intend to adopt in
order to bring this about. After all,
weather conditions play a most im-
portant part in the yield of any country.
A dry spell in Australia and the Argen-
tine for any season might easily result
in a curtailment of the expected yield
by 25 per cent. On the other
hand, excessive rains in Europe during
harvest would have the same result. So
it is beyond human intelligence to esti-
mate 12 months before harvest the area
that should be sown in order to either
substantially increase or decrease the
quota allotment to any country. The
gradual decrease in the consumption of
wheat products in Europe, because of
the increase in consumption of other
grain products, should not be overlooked.
A large proportion of Europe’s inhabi-
tants have been underfed. This is a
factor that should be seriously considered
when discussing world grain crops. Im-
provement in the European spending
power is likely to be quickly followed by
a greater consumption of wheat. Further-
more, Asia promises to import wheat
in increasing quantities year by year, pro-
vided prices do not advance to a point
out of reach of a large proportion of
the nationals of Japan and China. Aus-
tralia in recent years has exported to
Asiatic countries about 50 per cent, of
her annual surplus.
Asia is Australia’s natural market
—it is one-half the distance of the Euro-
pean market from the source of pro-
duction.
Recent Wool Sales
Opinion in London, following the
second series of Sydney sales, the open-
ing of British auctions and operations in
Melbourne and elsewhere supports the
contention of The Bulletin that caution
of outlook is needed. London advices
suggest that while it is hoped that the
market will be maintained, it is impos-
sible to judge. London prices showed a
10 to 15 per cent, advance on June sales,
but the bidding lacked the spectacular
brilliance of Australian first-series efforts
—possibly Japanese buying is the solu-
tion of the variation between the world-
divided auctions. The top market stands
firm for finer lines, though without a
buoyancy which suggests any further
rises, and there has been an actual weak-
ening in 56’s downwards.
* * * *
In Sydney, though first-class lines
firmed, and Japan was buying keenly,
Bradford activity seemed to fall away to
some extent, and as the sale during last
week progressed average values settled
down to .3d. per pound less than the
average for the last week of the first
Sydney series. This was not at all bad
considering quality, for the second-series
offerings included a lot of wool carrying
burr and dust and seed. At times there
was irregularity, but the wholehearted
entry of Belgium into the contest for the
first time in the new season had an excel-
lent effect towards the end of the sale.
* * * *
While Sydney was selling, Melbourne,
Perth and Geelong opened fire. Every-
where Japan was prominent. The Vic-
torian clip seems to be a splendid one,
and better grades were sometimes as
much as 55 per cent, higher than last
season in Melbourne, though the open-
ing burst was succeeded by a weak period
before prices settled down to a steady
strength, with the Continent and Japan
taking most of the supplies. In Perth
rates were 50 per cent, above last
season’s, and 25 per cent, above the level
of the June series. Geelong was not so
easy to judge as a whole, seeing that this
year some of the magnificent types for
which the district is famous were
absent. The bulk of the clip offered
came from the northern part of the State
and the Riverina.
* * * *
Well on to 200,000 bales of new
season’s wool have been disposed of, so
that if price levels are artificial we should
soon know, more especially as the
gradual unfolding of the statistical posi-
tion makes it easier to judge what wool
is available. Kreglingers, in their cir-
cular just issued in Antwerp, declare that
the nominal shrinkage in Australian out-
put will actually be doubled through clip
lightness, bringing it down 600,000 bales.
This slightly exceeds The Bulletin’s
estimate, which a few weeks ago Sydney
authorities were inclined to question.
South Africa, Kreglingers believe, will be
short 150,000 to 250,000 bales. All
in all, the position seems to be pretty
sound. In the next two months there will
be an expansion of available supplies,
but mills seem to have extensive forward
orders everywhere, and the tone of
urgency about Oriental and European
bidding is a good augury. Still, at best,
not much can be expected in the way
of advances. The market has steadied
into its stride ; its tendency is more likely
to be towards weakness than towards
strength.
Auction v. Shed Sales
“Golightly”: I have always favored
the auction market for wool; but I sold
this season’s clip in the shed. The com-
parative net returns with the sale of last
season’s clip are:
1932-33 1933-34
(Sold end (Sold
February). Sept. 19).
Merinos—
AAA ewes .. .. .. BAd. 18d.
AA 64 d. 15d.
A 6d. 14d.
First pieces ewes .. .. 6d. 12d.
Second pieces ewes.. .. 3d. Bd.
Bellies .. .. .. 2Jd. Bd.
Stains .. .. .. lid. 7d.
Locks 2d. «d.
Comeback—
AAA ewes .. .. .. 7d. 144 d.
AA 64d. 12d.
A crossbred ewes.. . . 3 jd. Sd.
AA lambs .. .. .. 54d. 12d.
A „ Id. 64d.
I shear in September ; the clip is off ewes
rearing lambs for the fat market; the
wool is burry and heavy. After waiting
until March last year for the wool
cheque, my net return was s|d. per
pound (all in); this year’s sale in the
shed netted me 12d. per pound (all in),
and cash on September 19 —three days
after shearing was completed. The fact
that the local buyer can give me an in-
crease of over 100 per cent, when the
market is said to be up 45 per cent, needs
explaining; so dqes the fluctuation of
over 100 per cent, in value of my clip
in six months. It is time we had appraisal
and cut out the gamble.
* * * *
“Junee”: Only stabilisation will check
the growing tendency to sell wool in the
shed. Stabilisation has nothing to do
with price. fixation; it aims at ironing
out inexplicable price fluctuations. Ex-
perience has taught graziers that auction
sales are a far greater gamble than sell-
ing at home. In order to get money to
stock up many graziers are disposing of
their clips in the country; they cannot
wait their turn, and financial houses in
their wisdom are not prepared to advance
to present limits of values. If prices
were stabilised at, say, 12d. per pound,
sellers, buyers and brokers would know
exactly where they stood, and finance
would be more readily available for
pressing demands. The suggestion that
shed sellers are losing 3d. per pound is
not correct; they have a shrewd idea
of their wool’s value. In pre-war days
there was admittedly a good deal of
speculative buying. But I don’t know
that speculators made fortunes at the
game, and a number of them took the
knock.
* * * *
“F.E.H.”: A point of great interest
to Australian woolgrowers has been
raised by a South African press contro-
versy. The president of the S.A. Wool
Brokers’ Association said publicly that
South African wool for the 1932 season
sold at about a penny a pound below
world parity, which he attributed to the
effect of the proposed Draft Bill, which
had restricted competition. A grower re-
plied that the 1932 clip was sold before
the proposed Draft Bill was published,
so that could not have been the reason.
A woolbuyer then stated that for many
years past South African wool had sold
slightly above world parity, due partly
to its quality, but largely to the extreme
competition which existed at all South
African ports. He knew of cases where
overseas firms had decided to close their
South African branches, as they could
buy more profitably in Australia and
South America.
* * * *
About half the wool of S.A. is sold by
private treaty. Yet this buyer asserts
definitely that he has to go where this
high standard of selling efficiency exists
to procure cheap wool. What have those
controlling the Australian system to say?
Eggs Ninepence a Dozen
“Kukuruk”: A row has developed in
the N.S.W. poultry industry. If ever the
feather squatter felt enthusiastically
homicidal it was when he learned that
the State Egg Board had run amok
and reduced the price of the very best
hen fruit to 9d. a dozen —making the
local market at least 14d. a dozen below
London parity. The board blames
producer-agents, whom it has registered,
for price-cutting. By reducing the official
quotation the board says it hopes to put
a stopper on these producer-agents, but
as they number over 3000 realisation of
that hope seems doubtful.
* * * *
In N. S. Wales the poultry industry is
divided into three sections. One of these
permits the board to handle all its out-
put, and dutifully accepts all the board
says or does; these disciples are firmly
bound under the seal of a covenant
which, for completeness of tie-up,
eclipses the old marine policies of 50
years ago. The second, preferring a free
leg, is associated with the Sussex-street
houses under the title of the United Egg
Producers and Distributors’ Association.
The third sells where and when it lists,
and» according to A. G. Crooke, the
dynamic force behind the Egg Board,
sells lower than it should —hence a nine-
penny market.
* * * *
Sussex-street agents are advancing
their clients lOd. a dozen net on export,
while the board is providing lid. a
dozen, less Id. levy, and has fixed the
price for the local market at one penny
less. The agents and their association
claim that the local market could have
been held at lOd. to Is. without impair-
ing consumption. The present price is
below production cost.
Pig-selling Costs
“Dennis”: S.A. railway trucks are
divided into two parts for carrying pigs,
20 being the regulation load for one
half; and freight from my station to
Adelaide is £4. If one pig is placed in the
empty half the farmer pays another £4.
So we have to make up a load of either
20 or 40. Should not freight on pigs
be fixed at 4s. per head for any number
in excess of 20? The first to arrive at
the trucking yards make up 20 between
them. If the rest cannot do that they
have to cart their pork home again.
* * * *
“W.D.McC.”: I endorse “Poddy’s”
views (B. 16/8/’33 and 13/9/’33) re-
garding high pig-selling costs and the
price and quality of mill offal. Thirty
years ago I bought bran for 6d. a
bushel, and wheat was dearer than it
is to-day. Bran is Is. a bushel to-day ;
pollard is more, and both articles have
slipped in quality. Vic. Agriculture De-
partment is suffering from sleeping sick-
ness. One never hears of a prosecution
under the Pure Fodder Act.
Landing Fruit in U.K.
“N.Z.”: The loss of the Maoriland
market to citrus growers this year no
doubt contributed largely towards the in-
creased interest taken in export to U.K.
Already a larger quantity of oranges has
been dispatched to that market than ever
before in any one year. The oranges
appear to be arriving in good order, but
the market is not returning a profitable
price. Consequently there will probably
be some difficulty in finding sufficient to
fill the requirements of the projected
shipment at the end of this month. The
expense of landing the fruit in England
is high. The following seems to be the
generally-accepted figure:
s. d.
Case, including making up . . .. .. 18
Wiring and strapping .. .. .. 2
Wrapping paper . . .. .. . . 2
Packing and grading .. .. .. .. 16
Rail freight .. . . . . ■ • . ■ 10
Pre-cooling and cartage to and from cooler 8
Loading, wharfage and forwarding charges .. 3
Marine insurance .. .. • • • • 1 '
Ship’s freight .. .. • • • • 5 3
A total of 10s. 9d., to be paid in cash
before the ship sails. To this must be
added docking and other landing charges
in London, cartage to market and selling
commission. These charges total about
13s. from the orchard to sale in U.K. ;
and the figures make no allowance for
the value of the fruit. Before there is
much chance of export being profitable
some of these expenses must be reduced.

Queensland’s Leading Newspaper
ON Monday, August 38, “The Brisbane Courier” and “The Daily Mail” were
amalgamated. The result has proved to be an immensely improved newspaper—
“ The Courier-Mail.” The pooling of the circulations of the two papers, a«er
allowing a liberal reduction for duplication, will give “The Courier-Mai

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Five Men of Brisbane
The five pictures in this week’s gallery
all are of citizens well rooted in public
life in Brisbane. They are as familiar
to passers-by there as One Tree Hill or
Victoria Bridge.
Tom McWilliam helped to build Bra-
bant and Cos. and all its varied activities.
He has a flair for good fellowship, and
when Brisbane meets at the Resurrec-
tion and the Grand Marshall cries
“Stand aside, all friends of Tom McWil-
liam!” somebody will be killed in the
rush. George Waugh is a solicitor —and
a philosopher. He takes an unobtrusive
part in public affairs, and settles disputes
by kindly advice rather than by litiga-
tion. He acts in an honorary legal
capacity for the Royal National Agri-
cultural Society.
J. W. Irving is veterinary surgeon to
the R.N.A.S. and does a heap of work
for it. So does C. R. Pick worth, manager
of the Singer sewing-machine organisa-
tion ; Pickworth has given so much time
to the affairs of the Show that if it were
all totted up it would cut a good slice
out of eternity. He has held most of the
offices in the gift of the association short
of the presidency and chairmanship of the
council.
Last comes secretary Watson, of the
R.N.A.S. Frith caught him in a slightly
inflated moment; apparently he was car-

rying the extra load of cash which rolled
in at the last Show. Watson is one of
the busiest men in Brisbane. His only
holidays are taken normally a la ’bus-
man —visiting other Shows.
“Kaloa”: New Guinea natives are to
lose their shell money, which certainly
had its advantages. In outlying districts
it was rated by the fathom, and could be,
wound round the neck, put through a
hole in the ear or generally hung on the
wife’s convenient angles. Except around
Nakanai, where they believe in inflation.
There money is woven out of fibre or
leaf, tastefully edged with dogs’ teeth,
and value goes according to size. The
largest coin in the old days was too big
to get through a doorway. Civilisation
has made many difficulties for the native
financial system. The arrival of Japanese-
made artificial tambu caused serious in-
flation in some districts a few years ago.
Abolition of tambu will certainly stop
a lot of abuses, but unless the Govern-
ment adopts the Indian system of mak-
ing coins of different values different
shapes a metal-money system may cause
lot more.

i “J.”: Coffee-growing has possibilities.
Daniel Jones, the cotton-culture specialist,
fias grown the Arabian variety at his
Petrie-terrace home. The berries were
treated by Thurlow’s, and the coffee is
claimed to be equal to imported. We
•import 1500 tons a year, so there is
scope for local industry. In the Pialba
district there was a commercial area
•where fragrant coffee was produced. This
coffee won a prize at the Franco-British
Exhibition. Shrubs, when pruned, re-
quire but a minimum amount of atten-
tion.

“Mining Fool”: Two men engaged on
the Queensland Government’s prospect-
ing relief scheme in Charters Towers
netted £5OO last week, when they got
750 z. smelted gold from 17 tons of ore.
The conditions of this scheme are that
the men receive relief pay weekly on
condition that they prospect and work
mining shows in approved fields. On this
Charters Towers field, 32 married men
and 14 single men are working. The
average value of production is 21s. per
week per man.

“Yowai”: The nonsense which some-
times' is talked about the North is well
illustrated by recent interviews in the
press of various southern States regard-
ing the Caledon Bay affair. Most tourists
earnestly quote the opinions of casual
visitors met in Darwin —which is like
quoting the view of the first man met
on Circular Quay or in Petrie’s Bight
about conditions on Norfolk Island or
in, say, Hawker (S.A.). One leading
newspaper, which has solemnly given its
counsel to the Government as to how it
should proceed, fortifying its advice with
weird and wonderful aboriginal lore,
continually describes the business as
“the trouble with the natives on Groote
Eylandt”—though all the actual fun has
been on the mainland and all the danger
to Groote Eylandt seems to have been
generated in the mind of some Minister.
The latest development has been the cir-
culation of the photographs of the police
expedition which has left the Roper-
four constables who are to protect the
Groote Eylandt mission against 2000
mainland savages. I know what is going
to happen to the leader —Constable
Morey—who is almost the double of
Tom Mix. Some simple savage is going
to steal silently upon him in the greying
dawn and pinch his hat for use as a
water bucket.

“Vic”: Queensland is going to make a
bid for the Asian coal trade, and a
delegation on which various coal dis-
tricts and the Government will be repre-
sented will shortly leave Australia to
investigate. It is probable that W. H.
Austin, Linder-Secretary to the Depart-
ment of Labor and Industry, will be the
State nominee. It should be an oppor-
tunity. Asia has plenty of anthracite,
but coking coals are as scarce as pea-
cocks’ teeth.

“Oxeye”: A great row is in progress
in Queensland over fruit freights, and so
there should be. While mandarin- and
orange-growers round Sydney are going
bankrupt, the west of Queensland and
N.S.W.’s west are starving for fruit
—in some districts the race actually is
deteriorating for lack of it. The reason
is the eternal freight bugbear, which in
the North increases the cost by at least
50 per cent. At present, to send a 451 b.
pack of fruit westward from Brisbane
costs from Is. to 35., plus handling
charges. It is too much. Fruit for the
use of school-children should be car-
ried free. If this were the case, there
is no doubt that philanthropic growers
who know what oranges mean to the
youngsters would reduce their costs to a
minimum in order to see that every
kiddy had his health-giving fruit every
day.
“Pooh-Bah”: George Porter, Queens-
land’s Registrar-General, was asked to
decide an unusual case recently. His
decision allowed E. B. Kruttschnitt to
run in under-15 races at the secondary
schools’ annual sports on September 16,
although the youth was born on that
date in 1918. The event took place in
America, however, and as a day is added
to the calendar on the way over he was
not actually 15 till the next day. Krutt-
schnitt ran second in the 220 yards.

“0.K.”: Queensland does not intend
to allow the Commonwealth Government
to get away too easily with its scheme
for missing Brisbane out of the England-
Australia air route. The latest attack
on the Canberra fort comes from Dr.
Cilento, who has submitted a report to
Dr. Cumpston, Director-General of
Health. He declares, after having offi-
cially traversed the proposed air route,
that quarantine can best be enforced by
establishing check points at Darwin and
Brisbane.

“Vic ”: Gladstone, which nearly be-
came the capital of a new State more
than three-quarters of a century ago,
when Colonel Barney was sent north
and established a tentative settlement
there, has decided to have a new Town
Hall, and tenders have been accepted.
As, already, it has one of the finest har-
bors in Australia —Admiral Henderson,
who inspected it, declared that, except for
Brest, it would make the finest naval
base in the world —it hopes to make the
new structure match its ambitions, which
are not modest.

“Lover’s Walk”: Darwin has become
distinguished. Till recently, the South
only noticed us when we were bad
boys, or when we made so much noise
singing the “Red Flag” that somebody
had to listen to us. Now a group of
southern newspapers has discovered us
and has sent us a young man as a per-
manent correspondent. We like it, and
it is considerably improving our manners
and appearance. Time was, for instance,
when our police used to go bush looking
just like police, but since their photo-
graphs have been required for syndica-
tion down South they have begun to
dress like two-gun sheriffs. Civil ser-
vants who never shaved except on Wed-
nesdays and Saturdays have achieved a
smooth look, and the demand at the lib-
rary for Rolf Boldrewood, Mrs. /Eneas
Gunn, Ernest Favenc and Alfred Searcy
has gone up 50 per cent, as a result of
the rush for adventure material.

“Frigid”: The Worth Bros., of Innis-
fail, caught a double-headed parrot-fish
(Coris aygula ) on the Barrier Reef re-
cently. It was the first of the species
many of the old-timers have seen. It
had green-tinted scales, through which
ran brown, variegated lines. The skin
was light yellow around the gills, super-
imposed by dark-brown scrolls, promi-
nently marked. It had a big hump on
the back of the head, large teeth, and
the tips of two big tusks, tinted light
blue. Unfortunately the specimen was
gutted, which precluded any possibility
of the Museum using it. At present the
Museum has several heads, but no com-
plete specimen of the double-headed
parrot-fish.
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
“All the nice girls love a sailor.” Per-
haps that was why the men of H.M.A.S.
Moresby, which did a four-month survey
cruise in the Whitsunday Passage, the
night before they dropped anchor here
sharpened their razors and disposed of
the beards which had taken months to
cultivate.
The Queensland Scouts are fortunate
in having the Governor as their chief.
Through his enthusiasm we had day
after day of Scout welfare; a show at
the exhibition grounds took two days.
Scouts set themselves an ambitious task
when they said they would build a bridge
so that their Chief Scoutmaster might
walk then and there on the completed
structure. This they did. The Gov-
ernor crossed this 100 ft. bridge to the
accompaniment of the band playing
“Land of Hope and Glory.”
The Art Society wants its own gallery.
It has paid £5OO deposit on a building,
and invites people interested in the pro-
motion of art and culture to do the rest.
The Grammar School boys did not find
the 300 who attended their dance a tax
on their efforts as hosts. In fact, they
enjoyed looking after everybody. They
had had an exciting day at the all-
schools’ sports, and the dance was a
happy finale. Not only as hosts did
they excel, but also as decorators. They
had done the old schoolroom up with
rows of Japanese lanterns and put
greenery everywhere.
Evidently the schoolgirl fills her book-
case with the works of Dickens more
than the schoolboy. This was discovered
through an essay competition conducted
by the Dickens Fellowship, when out
of 188 entrants only seven were boys.
The Griffiths family, of Gympie, have
a unique record as golfers. The A
grade title has been in the possession of
their family ever since the game was
first played in Gympie, the father hold-
ing it until it was taken from him by
his son. For the last six years Miss
Griffith has won the associates’ cham-
pionship, beating her mother this year.
Freda Bage, principal of the Women’s
College, can always be relied upon to
make a neat little speech. She was on
the same programme as Sir Leslie Wil-
son. Dr. W. N. Robertson and Prof.
Alcock at a students’ dinner, but did
not mind. Her reply to one of the toasts
was witty and entertaining.
What price wool? Perhaps the happy
answer to the question had something to
do with the success of the Roma Golf
Club’s annual ball. The one and only
Hibernian Hall had its interior looking
festive with streamers and greenery. Pre-
sident C. D. Thomas and Mrs. Thomas
stood a long time receiving the guests,
many of whom came a good many hun-
dreds of n}iles to join in the fun.
William Bustard’s water-color of
Mount Nebo, bathed in glorious sun-
shine, and Roy Parkinson’s painting of
“The Toll Bar, Toowoomba,” were not
the only two pictures to catch the eye
at the 45th annual exhibition of the
Royal Queensland Art Society. The
Christian Science Building, North Quay*
saw the hanging of the pictures, the
graceful entrance columns being admired
as much as some of the paintings. Vida
Lahey, Stanhope Hobday, Gwendolyn
Grant and Jeanette Sheldon were among
the 50 contributing artists.
From Hamilton Heights, and even
from the Ascot tram, our dear old river
looked as though it required the traffic
cop’s help one recent morning. No fewer
than six ships decided to arrive on the
same day, flying the flags of six nations.
Prouder still are we when we learn that
141,082 tons of cargo was shipped. The
little tug Forceful was busy all day.
Never let the same bee sting you twice,
or even once, is what the workmen in
Queen-street thought the day they were
visited by a swarm of bees. Armed with
a box, the cautious workmen placed the
queen in her cage, and most of the loyal
subjects quickly followed.

Information Sought.
(1) What is the origin of the custom of “tin-
kettling” the newly-married ? (2) And of rice-
throwing at a wedding ? —BO5O.
(1) It is a perpetuation of the old English
custom of serenading a newly-wedded pair
with drums and fifes, and has been traced
by antiquarians to similar ceremonies per-
formed in Ancient Egypt. (2) A survival of
the pagan custom of offering sacrifices of corn,
oil and wine. It goes back to 4000 b.c.
Method of effectively ridding a fibro and
weatherboard house of fleas ? —BOll.
Spray the soil under and about the house with
copperas and water —enough copperas (which
is poison) to give the water a yellowish tint.
Any dogs about the place should be frequently
washed. Kerosene and sheep-dip mixed together
and diluted with water will also drive away
fleas and destroy their eggs. Pennyroyal, which
is plentiful now in parts of the country, is
another remedy. Scatter it under beds at night
and fleas will leave. Whei’e floors are uncovered
keep them damp in summer. Frequent washing
of linoleum is a further preventive.
(1) What is the origin of the Alsatian dog?
(2) What were originally his uses ? (3) In what
way is he a danger to sheep and cattle ? (4)
If he went wild would he be likely to cross with
the dingo ? (5) Is the Alsatian officially regarded
as dangerous in any State ? —7997.
(1) He is really the German shepherd dog,
the name being changed to Alsatian in Britain
during the war. He was bred from a cross of
Thuringian and Wiirtemberg shepherd dogs,
both with good qualities for the purpose for
which they were bred. (2) As a dog for guard-
ing the flocks, and for keeping them in pasture
and away from crops. (3) Untrained Alsatians
have been known to attack farm stock. Trained,
they have a good name in Europe. (4) During
the period in which Alsatians have been in Aus-
tralia, over 30 years, there is no known case
of a cross having occurred. (5) There is legis-
lation against the breed in Westralia, and
importation to Australia is not permitted save
by special permission of the Minister of
Customs.
(1) How can land be taken up in the Northern
Territory ? (2) What is considered a living
area ? (3) What rental must be paid to the
Government ? —7BOO.
(1) and (3) Unoccupied Crown lands may be
applied for and taken up under grazing license
on an annual tenure at a minimum rental of Is.
per sq. mile, together with a license fee of £l.
An applicant for a grazing license should state
his full name, address and occupation, and for-
ward fees based on the before-mentioned rates.
A description of the area it is desired to take
up should also be supplied. (2) Depends on the
nature of the industry decided upon, whether
cattle raising or agriculture, and also the district
in which it is desired to settle.
(1) Where is antimony found in Australia
and elsewhere ? (2) Current market price ?
(3) Uses ? (4) Annual consumption in Aus-
tralia ? (5) In what form is it found and how
treated to obtain the pure metal ? (6) Names
of firms dealing in this metal ? —7944.
(1) The ore exists in practically all States cf
the Commonwealth and in Europe, Asia and
America. (2) English regulus, £37 10s. to £4O;
Chinese regulus, £23 to £23 10s.; crude,
'£lB 15s. per ton. (3) In alloys such as anti-
friction metals, also in pigments and medicine.
(4) No record; probably a few hundred tons.
(5) In oxide and sulphide ores. The ores are
smelted. (6) Try Frank Hambridge, 22 Bridge-
street, and O. T. Lempriere and Co., Mac-
quarie-place, both Sydney.
The Sydney suburban street in which I reside
is cursed with a dog whose owner permits it to
roam the street at night. The animal barks and
howls continually and robs the residents of
rest. The owner refuses to restrain it. What
is the remedy? —79s3.
There is an ordinance under the N.S.W.
Local Government Act applicable to howling
dogs, but it has not been applied by all coun-
cils. You should make inquiry from the local
council clerk or inspector of nuisances and,
if the ordinance is in force, ask that action
be taken under it.
(1) What is the name of the author who writes
as “Bartimeus” ? (2) Correct pronunciation of
the name “Le Queux” ? —7737.
(1) L. A. da Costa Ricci. (2) Le Kwex.
(1) Is there u Huon River in New Guinea ’
(2) If so, how or from whom did it derive its
name ? —BOB5.
(1) No river of that name, but there is a
Huon Gulf, on which Salamaua, port for ’.he
N.G. goldfields stands. (2) Probably named
after Huon dc Kermadec, a member ot the
d’Entrccasteaux expedition.
(1) What is the average price of shark
skins per pound ? (2) What treatment must
they receive before marketing ? (3) Where can
they be marketed ? (4) Is any particular type
of shark preferred ? (5) Are the skins tanned
in a similar manner to bullock hides ? (6) Can
greenhide be made from them ? (7) Where can
I get further information on the subject ?
7982. , ,
(1) Value depends on size and freedom from
cuts. The average is about 6d. per pound. (2)
Fleshing and salting. (3) There are no local
markets and the skins have to be exported.
Unless regular supplies can be given there is
very little demand. (4) No particular type of
shark is preferred, but there is a certain demand
for wobbegong skins. (5) The skins require
special treatment before tanning in order to
remove the shagreen. (6) Can’t say. (7) Shark
Fisheries, Ltd., 17 O’Connell-strcet, Sydney.
Which of the Commonwealth Government
departments now remaining in Melbourne or
elsewhere are ultimately to be transferred to
Canberra, and which are next likely to be so
transferred ? —7560.
Departments or branches not yet transferred
to Canberra are the departments of the
Postmaster-General, Defence, Commerce and
Repatriation, Taxation branch (part), Auditor-
General’s office, War Service Homes Commis-
sion, Australian War Memorial, Meteorological
branch, Lighthouse and Navigation branches.
Bankruptcy branch, Public Service Arbitrator’s
office, Tariff Board, and the Council for Scien-
tific and Industrial Research. It is not possible
at present to indicate the departments which
are next likely to be transferred to Canberra,
as none is actually listed for early transfer,
the policy in this respect being guided by the
funds provided by Parliament for the purpose.
How can I get a job as a lift attendant in
Sydney ? —7967.
See Scaffolding and Lifts Department, Chal-
font Chambers, Phillip-street, Sydney, any
Friday morning for application forms and
details of requirements. You will be required
to produce a reference as to character, and
evidence that you have driven a lift for 14
days.
(1) How is cornflour manufactured ? (2)
Cost of plant for manufacture on farm ? —7834.
(1) A white maize, such as Silvermine, is
used. It is crushed very finely by high-powered
machinery, and forced through fine cloth to
obtain the finest cornflour. It is possible to
make a very good rough cornflour on the farm,
but if yellow or red varieties of maize are used
the product will be slightly colored. (2) Any
good grinding machine for grain will do. Write
Anthony Hordern and Sons, Sydney, for quota-
tions for a machine for making fine meal.
What chemical will hold iron in solution ? —■
7842.
Hydrochloric acid will dissolve fine iron
filings. The acid is extremely dangerous to
handle and great care should be taken. If you
state the purpose for which a solution is re-
quired further information could be given.
(1) What is the rate of growth ( length ) of
crocodiles ? (2) Is the digestive apparatus of
the crocodile the same as that of other animals ?
—7956.
(1) Growth depends on the food the reptiles
get. Normally, they increase in length from
sin. to Bin. every year, up to a certain limit,
say 10ft. Thereafter they grow more slowly.
After reaching full size, crocodiles live the rest
of their lives with only an increase in girth.
The young crocodile, when hatched, is about
Bin. long. (2) Yes.
Brief history of Scots Church, Sydney ? —7879.
Foundation stone laid 1824; opened for
worship 1826; old church demolished 1926,
Foundation stone of new Assembly Hall and
Scots Church was laid 1929; opened for wor-
ship 1930. The ministers were Dr. John Dun-
more Lang, 1826-1878; A. Milne Jarvie, 1879-
1886; Dr. W. M. Dill Macky, 1887-1913;
Thos. Tait, 1915-1924; H. R. Grassick, 1926-
1931. The present minister, Rev. W. J. Baxter,
concludes his ministry this month, and will be
succeeded by the Rev. J. H. Duncan, of the
Laigh Kirk, Kilmarnock.
(1) Who wrote “The Barber of Seville” ? (2)
Who made it into an opera? —7Bl9.
(1) Beaumarchais. (2) Rossini is the only
composer of music to the libretto whose work
is remembered. Before Rossini F. L. Benda,
J. A. Schulz, Pasiello and Isouard wrote operas
on the same theme and had them performed.
After Rossini there are, embalmed in the grave-
yards of music publishers, the “Barbers” of
Morlacchi, dall’Argine, Graffigna, Jimenez and
Neto (a Spanish collaboration) and Leopoldo
Cassone. Cassone’s opera was announced in
1923 as being prepared for performance, but
there is no record as to its reception.
(1) Is there a market for a piano-playing
machine in which all fingering is mechanically
operated, but in which every nuance of tempo,
volume of sound and relationship between
melody (or melodies) and accompaniment is
under the control of the operator ? (2) Could
such a machine improve upon modern piano-
forte technique ? (3) How far do the latest
piano-playing machines fall short of perfec-
tion ? (4) Is digital perfection necessary to the
interpretation of the greatest pianoforte works ?
—7831.
(1) Yes, almost irrespective of cost. (2) Yes.
The human hand, considered as a mechanical
contrivance, is tremendously handicapped 'by the
fact that the third finger is constitutionally
weak. (3) They do not escape giving a
mechanical impression. (4) Possibly not. All
the great composers for the pianoforte
and its predecessors were conversant with
digital limitations, and made allowances for
them. But there have been a few pianists in
the world—Teresa Carreno was one—who could
give every finger very nearly equal value, and
it is accepted that this power enhanced the ettect
of what they played.
How to keep a home-cured ham through the
summer months in a hot climate? — 1166.
Make sure the curing is perfect and not likely
to fail in the deepest part of the ham. Smoke
and dry as required, then cover thickly with
a coating of flour and water made to a thick
paste or light dough. It should be not less than
half an inch thick all over, leaving no bare
spots. Dry thoroughly and hang in a cool, airy
place. The coating will become hard as a
board, and must be soaked or chipped off when
the ham is wanted.
How to remove mould from pegamoid (imi-
tation Russian leather) upholstery ? —7768.
Dissolve soap flakes in very hot water, add
a little cloudy ammonia, wring out a thick
woollen cloth in the water, and clean the pega-
moid as well as possible. Rub dry with a clean
cloth. Make up a mixture of equal parts of
vinegar and raw linseed oil, apply sparingly to
the pegamoid with a woollen cloth, and polish
with another woollen cloth. Any good shoe
cream will also act as a cleaner and polisher.
lam building a 12 ft. sailing-boat, lap stroke
construction. What sorts of wood obtainable
in Vic. are suitable? —8017.
For keel, spotted gum; for curved stem and
knees, tea-tree; for planking, decking and
stern, M.L. kauri, Huon pine or beech: for
ribs, spotted gum or mountain ash; for mast
and boom, Oregon or ricker spruce.
Method for removing old cracked paint from
a canvas-covered deck without injuring the
canvas ? —7951.
Have boat out of wind and sun, and give
deck one thick coat of paint remover. Allow
this to stand for one hour, then apply another
extra thick coat and allow to stand for half an
hour. The paint can then be easily taken off
the canvas with a painter's stripping knife. Have
the corners ground off knife to safeguard against
cutting canvas.
(1) Best method of caulking a canoe with
\in. maple planks ? (2) Would it be necessary
to canvas it ? If so, what is best adhesive ?
7954.
(1) and (2) It is impossible to caulk seams
with such thin planking, so it will be neces-
sary to cover the canoe with canvas held in
place by means of light battens fastened over
it at the keel, gunwales, stem, stern, etc.
There is no satisfactory adhesive.
Composition of belt grip for leather and
camel-hair belts ? —7659.
Usual practice is to use a mixture of resin
and castor oil.
What can 1 do to save a liolly-tree which is
covered with smut? —Bol4.
Spray with formalin mixture (lib. to 50gals.
of water). Remove badly affected limbs and
burn them; the shrub will soon make new
growth.
My young white cockatoo picks his feathers
out. What's the remedy ? —7979.
Rub vaseline into the feathers; the bird will
cease to pick at the plumage, which will get a
chance to grow. Give water and green feed.
My dog’s gums get inflamed around the fangs
and, although the teeth are quite sound, there
are small brown stains on some of the fangs.
He is six years old and quite healthy. If this is
serious, what is the remedy? —79l3.
The gum trouble and spots on teeth are pro-
bably due to disordered stomach arising out of
improper feeding. The food should consist oft-
one meal per day, 80 p.c. to be raw beef, the
balance to be dog biscuit, broken into small
pieces. A large bone given occasionally is a
dog’s toothbrush. Soft, sloppy food is incor-
rect. To clean the teeth use hydrogen peroxide.
How to preserve eggs in salt and lime solu-
tion ? —7911.
The solution is formed by mixing freshly
slaked lime at the rate of 21b. to five gallons of
water, stirring three times per day until a milky
fluid is formed. To this solution lib. of fine
salt should be added. After being allowed to
stand for several hours, the liquid should be
poured off; it is then ready for the eggs.
(1) Short biographical sketch of Eugene
O’Neill ? (2) What plays has he written ? (3)
Any books on his life and career ? (4) Are his
plays accepted generally as being good “theatre”
plays ? If so, why are they not produced more
frequently in England and elsewhere outside
the U.S.A. ? (5) What is his address ? —BO4O.
(1) Born New York, 1888, son of an, actor;
educated Princeton and Harvard; twice divorced,
and now again married. Commenced career as
playwright, 1914. (2) “Thirst,” “In the Zone,”
“The Rope,” “lie,” “The Moon of the Carib-
bees,” “Beyond the Horizon,” “Diff’rent,” “The
Emperor Jones,” “The Straw,” “Gold,” “Anna
Christie,” “The First Man,” “The Hairy Ape,”
“The Fountain,” “Wedded,” “All God’s Chillun
Got Wings,” “Desire Under the Elms,” “The
Great God Brown,” “Lazarus Laughed,”
“Before Breakfast,” “Where the Cross Is Made,"
“Marco Millions,” “Strange Interlude,”
“Dynamo,” “Homecoming,” “The Hunted” and
“The Haunted.” (3) Can trace none. (4) “The
Emperor Jones” and “Anna Christie” were
great stage successes. The flavor seems more
palatable to American than to European taste.
(5) Sea Island, Georgia, U.S.A.
(1) Would it be possible to syphon water
from a well 15 ft. deep to a site about 300 yards
away 2ft. lower than the water in the well ?
The pipe would have to go straight down the
well, and over a small rise. (2) How could
the syphon be started ? —7856.
(1) Yes, but if the water level in the well
drops 2ft. the flow in the syphon will cease.
(2) The syphon pipe must be completely filled
with water, a job calling for a good deal of
ingenuity.
The best method of fastening the sheets of
MS. of a novel together ? Is it usual or
advisable to enclose in a cover or folder, and
what should be used for this purpose ? —8133.
Usual practice is to bind the MS. in sections
of convenient thickness, using three long
staples on the left-hand edge, covering each
section with stiff manila paper. For packing,
two pieces of stiff strawboard, the size of the
MS., are used. A method very convenient to
the reader is to file the MS. in a cheap “Pilot”
file, which obviates need for covers and pack-
ing boards.
1 am a Queenslander resident in Sydney, and
I propose to send a hamper to friends in Eng-
land to be delivered in time for Christmas.
Where can I make arrangements for a charac-
teristic Queensland hamper? —8135.
Get in touch with Q’land Government
Tourist Bureau, Martin-place, Sydney, which
is agent for the Q’land Preference League. The
league packs and dispatches a hamper con-
taining 25 sorts of Q’land fruits to Britain for
£l, inclusive of all freight and delivery charges.
Brief Answers.
R.F.S.: (1) and (2) That sort of knowledge
cannot be gained from books, but Ruskin s
works, particularly “The Stones of Venice."
will give you a grounding in what used to be
the canons of criticism. An appreciation of the
more eccentric forms of modern impressionism
and expressionism is something that evades many
folk who have made a life study of pictorial and
plastic art. (3) Yes, but an art training is the
best foundation... .0.W.: During childhood
an illegitimate child is under the control ot
its mother, and it is for her to say where the
child shall live, provided that where it is found
by a Children’s Court to be neglected or ill-
treated by its parent it may be removed from
her custody and be boarded out with suitable
persons. Should the mother subsequently
marry it does not transfer any control over
the illegitimate child to the husband....
A.A.J.: Possibly Philips Koninck, Dutch
painter, 1619-88; subjects mostly sunlight shin-
ing through clouds on open landscape....
H.E.8.: If the domestic is engaged solely in
duties of a private nature and not in prepar-
ing food on sleeping premises for employees,
the amount paid is not subject to family-
endowment tax. Unless amounts, plus board
allowance, paid to the farm and station em-
ployees exceed £3 for the week, family-endow-
ment tax is not payable... .R.C.: The process of
treating sardines for commercial purposes is a
trade secret... .N.C.C.: Austin’s “Fur Dress-
ing and Fur Dyeing,” Dymocks, Sydney....
X.Y.Z.: (1) If the mortgage is capable of
registration it should be registered. (2) In the
names of the trustees. (3) At any time after
registration at the Registrar-General’s Depart-
ment, Queen’s Square, Sydney. (4) Yes....
Traveller: (1) Yes. (2) Too numerous to give
in detail but includes advertisements, affidavits,
searches, inventory of what is comprised in
the estate, etc. See an officer in the Probate
Department, Supreme Court House, Elizabeth-
street, Sydney, purchase forms and obtain neces-
sary information. (3) Cannot give precise cost,
but it should not be much.... J.W.1.: (1) and
(2) Full directions in an article by Miss N. B.
Adams in “Museum Mag.,” Vol. IV, Part 5,
Jan.-March, 1931, Is. Id. posted from Aus-
tralian Museum, Sydney... .H.P.: The referen-
dum issue was whether conscripts should be
sent abroad on military duty. The Federal
Constitution provides that “the Commonwealth
shall protect every State against invasion” and
should an enemy invade any part of Australia
there is little doubt the Government could
conscript citizens. The Hughes Government
was advised, however, that it could not con-
script to send abroad without authority through
a referendum H.S.H.: You could terminate
the weekly tenancy by a week’s notice and eject
the tenant or receive him on a new tenancy at
a higher rental. There is no restriction of the
rent under the new tenancy... .K.S.C.: The
question was settled many years ago. In a
leading case it was held that as English law-
gives the owner of land all that lies beneath
its surface, he may dig beneath such surface at
his free will. You cannot obtain an injunc-
tion to restrain him.... J.P.C.: (1) Third-
class fare, Sydney to Vancouver, £3l 10s. (2)
No better than Australia... .N.M.G.L.:
Address of Alfred Nobel’s trustees is Nobel-
stiftelsens Styrelse, Sturegatan 24, Stockholm,
Sweden... .H. 1.: Write to Tannery Branch, Syd-
ney Technical College... .H.L.: A mile square
is a square containing 640 acres; a square mile
is any area of 640 acres, regardless of shape
R.M.W.: It might bring £3 at Christie’s, but it
has no commercial value in Australia
Anxious: In the absence of any special rule
the cup should remain the property of the last
winner until it is again competed for E.N.:
(1) Jellicoe, as commander-in-chief, was with
the battleships, which came into action later
than the battle cruisers under Beatty. (2) No
special term... .E.E.L.: (1) For St. Bernard
pups try Wickett Bros., Pine-avenue, Under-
cliffe (N.S.W.), or Rushford, 24 Bailey-avenue,
South Preston, Vic. (2) Can’t say 1.C.:
President of Poland, Ignace Moscicki; President
of Turkey, Gazi Mustapha Kemal J.K.:
Can’t read your writing. Print the words in
block letters E.W.P.: Provided the suction
and discharge pipes are of the same internal
diameter and the same length, and frictional
resistance due to valves, bends, etc., is the
same in each pump, the same h.p. should be
required to drive each one. Carefully examine
the suction pipes and pump glands for possible
air leakages, as the most minute holes will
cause loss of water, and measure discharges to
determine whether both pumps are delivering
identical quantities per minute... .P.M.: The
only four-legged creature that lays eggs is the
platypus G.D.P.: Turner and Henderson,
Hunter-street, Sydney, stock Admiralty charts
and will quote you prices... .L.R.N.: Consult
a solicitor, as it Is necessary to apply to
Supreme, County or Petty Sessions Courts.
Present Act gives all rights of parents to
adopters and child has same rights as if
adopters’ natural child Barfold: (1) The
Financial Emergency Act (Vic.) provided for
an application by a mortgagor to a Court of
Petty Sessions to restrict a mortgagee’s rights
to foreclose, etc., within 12 months after the Act
came into operation (1931). By an Amending Act
(1932) its provisions are extended to certain
cases where interest has been paid. It is not clear
that you are entitled to relief under the Act,
but the only sound advice you can get is from
a solicitor with all the documents and facts
before him. (2) and (3) No, unless you have
covenanted to do so. (4) Probably. If this
is a mortgage, you have no doubt covenanted
to repair. (5) He cannot avoid payment of
his just debts, but should seek time from his
creditor H.R.P.: No Australian publication.
McDougal’s “Next of Kin” and Foster’s “List
of Heirs” are obtainable in London, and various
English agencies used to periodically publish
details of estates in Chancery. Dymocks,
Sydney, will inquire for you, if you ask them
to 5.R.8.: Under the Widows, Orphans and
Old Age Contributory Pensions Act (Britain,
1930) provision is made for pensioners who
migrated to the Dominions. Each case is dealt
with on its merits and application must be
made to the Old Age Pensions Branch, Minis-
try of Health, Whitehall, S.W.I R.C.C.:
No known Australian market for silkworm
cocoons. There have been several attempts to
launch the industry, but nothing seems to have
come of them... .F.W.: Lord Rosebery s
Derby winners were Ladas, 1894; Sir Visto.
1895; Cicero, 1905 Study: Director of
Education, Hobart, could give you authorita-
tive advice, and you could obtain lists of suit-
able books from C. P. Philip and Son, W.

h
picturesque salamaua
Salamaua, in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, is beauti-
fully situated on a narrow isthmus of sand-covered reef. Here
one of the more recent branches of the Bank of New South Wales
has been opened.
Salamaua lately came into prominence as a result of the develop-
ment of gold mining in the Territory, and the Bank, following the
practice it has always pursued since the earliest discoveries of gold
in Australasia, immediately made available full banking facilities.
The Bank at Salamaua undertakes the responsibility of safeguard-
ing the gold won ; maintains the currency and credits necessary
for internal and oversea commercial transactions.
Bank of New South Wales
(ESTABLISHED 1817)
with which the Western Australian Bank and The Australian

“Fortis”: All is not gold that glitters
—in teeth, anyway. Received some “Ger-
man gold,” used for filling teeth, the
other day. It proved on analysis to be
an ordinary brass containing 60 parts
of copper and 40 parts of zinc. There
is as little gold in it as there is silver in
“German silver,” which is merely an
alloy of copper, zinc and nickel.
* * * *
“Black Mt.”: Under one of those
ordinances it is an offence to publish
in the F.C.T. advertisements for or re-
sults of sweeps. The Canberra paper has
been prohibited from giving its readers
such information ; but Sydney dailies
containing bushels of it distribute it at
’Berra without let or hindrance. The
A.-G.’s department was asked whether it
was proposed to enforce the ordinance
equitably or drop it. No answer.
* * * *
“Michael”: Vic. Railway Department
and Melb. Tramway Board are hesitat-
ingly considering whether all-night travel-
ling facilities during the centenary
would pay. Until a couple of years ago
belated Melburnians had to travel home
by the last suburban or take a taxi.
Then a private owner initiated an hourly
service with an old crock on a single
route. Now he is running up-to-date
’buses on four routes, at half-hourly
intervals. And each trip gets its full
complement of passengers.
* * * *
“Aileron”: Aeroplanes branded “made
in Australia” promise soon to become
the rule ; the Commonwealth has issued
certificates of airworthiness to two new
commercial monoplanes designed and
built by Australians. One is a single-
engined five-seater ; the other, a three-
engined ’plane of almost the same de-
sign ; both are metal-fuselaged. It is
claimed that the three-engined craft is
the first in the world to show its ability
to get off the ground with a full load
of passengers and fuel while one engine
is stopped. Both machines have gone
into the mail service from Camooweal
(Q.) to Daly Waters (N.T.).
* * * *
“C.W.”: N. S. Wales has a Companies
Act which the president of the Institute
of Secretaries has justly described as
“one of the worst in the Empire.” It
permits a co. to carry on without ever
placing a balance sheet in the hands of
shareholders. It admits of worse thing;
being done by mushroom insurance and
bond-selling concerns; the policy- or
bond-holder who becomes inquisitive
can’t even get a look at the financial
standing of the co. he has trusted with
his money. And, however suspicious the
circumstances, it is almost impossible to
sustain prosecutions. Every Government
that comes along promises to amend this
rotten law. No Government ever does.
“General Prac.”: A barrister tells me
that no existing Australian statute can
protect the doctor who sterilises a man,
even though the patient be an imbecile.
The operation is trivial, and means five
minutes’ work only ; but, says my lawyer
friend, it entails the possible risk of a
criminal prosecution. The position in
Britain seems much the same. Lord
Atkin, in 1925, laid it down that any
surgeon who performed what he called
a “maiming” operation (and sterilisation
is apparently in that category) might find
himself in serious danger.
:Jc * ❖ *
“X. N. Queue”: Yerba mate deserves
serious consideration (B. 13/9/’33). It
may look uninviting, but the pale, weak-
looking brew is much stronger and more
stimulating than you would think. If
yerba did gain a following, what a crop
it would make for the North Coast
(N.S.W.) and s.-e. Queensland! There,
climate and conditions resemble those of
the plantation areas of S. Brazil, where
100,000 tons are gathered annually.
Harvesting begins when the trees are
four years old, and the problem of cheap
labor does not arise, as no delicate bud-
picking is required. The branches are
merely lopped off for the simple curing
process.
* * *
“Cauboy”: I am with the Musicians’
Union in its protest against the importa-
tion of the Coldstream Guards’ band by
the A.B.C. The union doesn’t object
to the band coming out under private
auspices, but considers it outrageous for
a Government concern to engage an out-
side organisation when half the musi-
cians in Australia are out of work—and
so do I. No Government aid was given
to the Professional Musicians when they
provided orchestral concerts at popular
prices (which the people didn’t support)
in Melbourne. As for the A.8.C., it
sacked the capable orchestra which used
to play dinner-hour music in Svdney
substituting gramophone records because
they are cheap.

N.G.: Aboriginal legends that require 262
lines of blank verse for thq telling are no use
... .R.W.8.: He may be right; but that doesn’t
make a story of it... .G.A.L.: You don t
know much about reporters, Judges or judicial
proceedings. A Judge doesn’t “deliver a bril-
liant speech to a crowded court” G.S.:
Read that sort of thing in the “Young
Ladies’ Journal”; never elsewhere.... M.M.:
Can’t do anything with it... .H.S.R.:
Just unsuitable... .J.A.S.: They don’t quite
get past L.G.: Hymnish N.W.: The
fact that the skunk presented to Melbourne
Zoo is to be deodorised by some surgical pro-
cess rather spoils your artless lay Scribe:
No “jewel five words long” in that... .William
C.: Don’t give way at the prospect of losing
“love’s lucent gold”; there are lots of other
girls J.B. (W.A.): Much too transparently
simple for a detective story... .A.S.: For all
the dramatic quality you infuse into it your

of sheep O.O.: Fancifulness is all right in
its way, but it won’t stand all that padding....
L.L.: Hashmagandy R. 8.: Don't like stories
where there is no clue to the position of the
mysterious island where the castaways find
themselves A.M.A. (Lond.): Admire your

you met in dreams
Lulled me with melodic sound
Till my wife my peaceful bliss did break:
“Come on, wake up, you good-fer-nothin’ hound!
Don’t sit there starin’, yer flamin’ fake!”
And that’s your idea of “a humorous twist,
so often lacking in poems of a like nature”!
W.I: An old complaint, but it gains noth-
ing in the versifying... .J. 8.: You shouldn’t
tackle these intricate verse-forms if you haven’t
learned that “wish” and “garnish” are impos-
sible rhymes... .R.E.: There’s only one road
to Gundagai... .1.M.G.: Obscurity is your
handicap... .E.C.: Utterly impossible to praise
it....C.H.: No market for shockers, however
gifted the amateur detective... .C.R.S.: It
made terribly hard reading... .D.G.S.: It has
all the melancholy-morbid flavor of a Russian
story... .J.A.C.: Interesting, and informative,
too, but we couldn’t find space for a travel-
sketch of that length... .H. 8.: Too much to
hang on a packet of fags....A.McD.: It alto-
gether failed to make our flesh creep... .E.D.:
Something pleasantly reminiscent of O. Henry’s
“Whistling Dick” in your “Nobby.” But we
can’t picture a girl falling in love with him.
. ...M.L.: Plenty of spell in Kipling, but
yours is just an essay, top-hampered with
quotations.... Bellerive: No waste of words
here: —
T’was a monday at the hour of noon.
I’d just sat down to dine.
When in the lane a fight ensued twixt—
A neighbour’s dog and mine.
I endeavoured for to stop ’em.
But my effort was in vain.
They wildly yelped and grappled—
Midst dust bins in the lane,
When my neighbour strong and burly.
To stop ’em dident fail.
He wrest my dog from danger—•
By his hind leg and his tail.
. ...J.E.S.: True enough, it’s funny, but, as
The Carpenter put it, “the butter’s spread too
thick”... .D.McA.: Not even liberal pruning
saves it....T.A.: Falls a long way short. For
the 1000th time, it is impossible to send criti-
cisms by post... .8.L.W.: No luck... .H.T.8.:
It may be necessary for your story that a man
can read a “collect” telegram before deciding
whether he will pay for it, but doubt if any
postmaster would allow it... .R.W.D.: You
frivol with such desperate earnestness....
P. 8.: There’s some good descriptive stuff in
it, but the plot tries us a bit too high... .C.T.:
Some thrill, but it scarcely reads convincingly.

yourself... .F.H.S. r The old, old triangle with

Deadwood Dick stuff. And your hero might
at least have dropped the police a word....

swans doing for Kalooma what the ravens did

Smacks of what Swinburne’s critics called the
fleshly school... .K.P.S.: Close up. We have a
prejudice in favor of verse that is intelligible

humor, but your Muse is over-hoydenish....
E.T.: You have an eye for Nature but not
much originality in limning it... .E.E.S.:

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
There’s always a fly in the ointment.
There were blowflies when the vice-
regals were at Sutton Forest. They
didn’t get within the Governor’s home,
which is netted against such intrusion,
but out of doors they buzzed and
boomed and were a trial to those who
would walk in leafy shade. However,
the family had one of its happiest holi-
days. The boys and Rosemary rode a
good deal, and son Philip got in some
heavy swatting with his geology—it’s
going to be his special subject at Cam-
bridge. David has an eye already cocked
on the diplomatic service.
* Lovers, old, young and middle-aged,
have been walking in the azalea
pleasaunce in the Gardens. They have
crossed the rustic bridge over the turgid
little stream with the miniature water-
fall on its right, and the great tree fern
and the flowering peach and plum blos-
som on the left. And then they have
sauntered beside the high and spreading
azalea bushes, smothered in pink and
rose and tawny blooms, through which
steps here and there an azalea bride,
lucent and virginal, a snowdrift of white.
As though this were not beauty enough,
on the right of the path trees of flower-
ing plum and peach lift their rose and
white candelabra to Heaven; wistaria
weaves a mauve-blue mist like a twi-
light of dreams; its honey-drugged
magnolia white sister droops in a Buddha-
like contemplation. One of these white
wistarias has lived its day—its petals are
beginning to brown, and here and there
to shrivel. Last Saturday an old gentle-
man paused before it and ran a hand
caressingly over it: “For favors received,
my dear!” he said gently, turning to the
equally elderly lady who accompanied
him.
The platinum blonde has given place
to the suicide blonde. Dyed by her own
hand.
The guests at the imaginary parties in
the Blaxland Galleries were represented
only by name-cards, but they made a
joyous mixed grill in such instances as
when Alexander Gordon’s lady had
paired Queen Victoria off with Noel
Coward, while at another table Lord
Kitchener sat next to Cleopatra. Socrates
presided over a table magnificent with
spreading silver candelabra and finest
crystal—evidently that wasn’t his hem-
lock day.
The table decorations and arrange-
ments had been carried out by well-
known hostesses. On . Dame Eadith
Walker’s table gleamed the finest Ven-
etian glass ; the waratah struck the domi-
nant note on Mrs. Clayton’s board. This
was covered with square lace mats, and
in the middle of the table were set three
clear, faintly-pink glass bowls. In each
of these a stemless waratah floated, its
deep-red glow clamorous behind the
glass.
Mussolini was, of course, an honored
guest at the table on which Italy’s colors
were stressed in tall ruby goblets, green-
patterned china and a centrepiece of low
white flower-holders and statuettes. Mrs.
Arthur Austin, of Melbourne, didn’t dis-
dain the artistic value of the lowly onion,
and placed it amidst the tall centrepiece
of fruits on her amber-decked board.
Probably the most work of all had gone
into the Julius lady’s Alice in Wonder-
land table, which was spread with a
grass cloth, set about with white pebbles
and delicately illustrated bits of the dia-
logue between the White Rabbit, Alice,
the Dormouse and the Mad Hatter.
These dominated the scene from a tiny
table set on a white-pebbled terrace.
Izaak Walton, Horace, and Robert Her-
rick sat down before the brown earthen-
ware mugs, the red cheese, the brown
loaf and the yellow butter of Mrs. Syd-
ney Jamieson’s table. This hostess was
among those who murmured the “Please,
give me a penny” refrain at the voting
table.
For the present, at any rate, the Reggie
Staffords, of Llangollen, have gone out
of wool. They have sold Llangollen on
a walk-in, walk-out basis, and their loss
up Cassillis way is going to leave a social
blank, for the Reggie Staffords’ parties
have been one long serial. Llangollen,
a quiet, old greystone homestead, sits
meditating in the hollow of blue hills.
Its swimming pool and tennis courts are
far-famed. A prolonged ramble through
Europe is the first item on the care-free
Staffords’ programme.
A beer-garden under the shade of the
sheltering palms will be the centrepiece
around which the Artists’ Ball will re-
volve. Here the Consuls will hold a
reception. Lud Mayor Hagon, dressed
as Dick Whittington, will, it is said, be
the first guest, and Marie Irvine, presi-
dent of the Women Painters, disguised as
the Erl King’s Housekeeper, will keep
an eye on the smooth running of the
premises. Norman Lindsay will make
his first appearance at an artists’ ball,
and among those who will stand under
the shower of four hundred or four thou-
sand balloons that will fall upon the just
and the unjust alike will be Earl Beau-
champ, who will be dressed in the only
fancy costume possible (or so he de-
clares) for him to wear in Sydney.
When Hoppe discovered Australia his
camera took a morning off from scenic
beauties to make some studies of the
subject of this picture, Mrs. Charles
Lloyd Jones. The lady combines good
looks and good works, and is a helper
of such causes as the Bush Book Club,
the Free Kindergartens and the St. John
Ambulance. The last is at present
absorbing much of her time and energy,
as she is one of the strong supports of
the Ladder of Fame, the art show
which will build up the year’s treasury
for it. This association is allowed to make
only one public appeal for funds in the
year, so it is up to the amateur artists
of city and suburb to join forces with his
State Ex., Johnnie Pye, Pat Levy and
William Morris Hughes to fill the show
with light and cheerfulness, if not with
grace.
Like the heroine of the old song who
first said she wouldn’t, then said she
couldn’t, then whispered “Well, I’ll see,”
Belle Finlayson for some months kept
see-sawing between two of her admirers.
One was George Roberts, Earl Beau-
champ’s private secretary, and he it was
who married Belle within St. Mary’s.
George, who is slim, elegant and hand-
some, looked a regular magazine bride-
groom, and his bride, in her shimmer of
satin and her beaten silver veil, from
which fell a cascade of tulle, was a delec-
table morsel. Her willow-wand brides-
maids wore frocks so fitting that they
might have been helped on with a shoe-
horn ; they were of cerulean-blue tulle,
frilled to the knees and ruffled about
the sleeves, and the wearers crowned
their heads with tiny pink flowers. The
’maids carried orchids and gold mesh
bags, the gifts of the ’groom; the bride
carried orchids and wore a blazing
diamond brooch, given by Lord Beau-
champ. Between two and three thou-
sand sightseers milled around the steps
of the Basilica, and along an avenue of
curious eyes the guests walked from their
cars into the Cavalier. Here Mr. and
Mrs. W. Finlayson did the welcome act,
while beside them Mr. and Mrs. George
Roberts were deluged with congratula-
tions. There were many speeches;
Earl Beauchamp sounded benign,
Father Bartlett manly, Mr. Finlayson
parental, the bridegroom romantic.
Ada Reeve was among the guests; so
were the Hugh D. Mclntosh couple.
Until the arrival of the Honorable Hugh
Lygon, the newly-weds will make their
home at Carthona, the Earl’s Darling
Point dugout.
Hats in the spring shows are mostly
of the soft, silky type of straw, and often
have little posies of flowers on them, like
a bunch of primroses with the stalks left
long. Sometimes the hats are wreathed
in flowers. Most of the crowns (when
not towering) are crushed down ; some
look as though they have been in the
rain and the home milliner has not been
able to get the bumps out.
Harry Dangar, back in town after
weeks away in the bush, in preparation
for his show in the Grosvenor Galleries
next week, declares he has said good-bye
to the stage for ever. Harry, a gifted
amateur, gave up city acting a long
time ago because it interfered with his
painting, but he still kept tryst with the
once-a-year production of the Returned
Soldiers and Sailors’ League in Single-
ton. The little company has just finished
a most successful season of “The Middle
Watch,” which was notable for the fact
that it was the only production of the
play in Australia (professional not ex-
cepted) in which the males were cor-
rectly turned out in the morning, after-
noon and evening kit of the Navy. The
principal of the Singleton cast had been
in the service, and he simply rounded up
his old friends on the battleships and
made them disgorge their wardrobes.
Lynette Clonan is one of the knock-
out arguments against the cant you some-
times hear about the uselessness of the
girl of to-day. Lynette is pretty, a grace-
ful and frequent dancer, yet she finds
time to help on many a committee. For
some time she has held office in the
Cumberland branch of the Country
Women’s Association, and she is a keen
worker in the cause of the Limbless
Soldier. Lynette has promised on
October 2 to become Mrs. S. O’Connor ;
and in the meantime she is sustaining
the usual welter of parties and presen-
tations that fall to the popular maid
prior to matrimony. Photo, from
Dorothy Welding.
The Ship Lovers’ Society is composed
of old sea captains and people of all
ages who dre interested in ships and the
men who go down to the sea in them,
The society had a roll-call last week
that made the Rawson Institute ring with
sea chantey and sea story. The star
performer was Captain Sinclair, of the
Melbourne Ship Lovers’ Society, a blithe
young seadog of 84. He not only
sang sea chanteys in a full, resonant voice,
but he acted them, hauling up the
shrouds (or whatever they are called) as
he sang. After that he gave a descrip-
tion of the tea-clippers romping home
from India as he saw them in the ’seven-
ties. Only through the eye and the
tongue of a lover could the audience
have caught fire, as it did, when he de-
scribed their lovely fines and swelling
sails. In his fancy the Ariel queened
them all. She was painted with flowers
and landscapes (inside, not out), her rail
was brass and so were the knots of the
lanyards.
You’d think the silkworms were on
strike, from the quantity of artificial silk-
weave in the shop windows and on the
display counters. So close an imitation
is the synthetic fabric that often it would
deceive the eye of the expert; and the
colorings and the shadings thereof are
more varied than those of the spectrum.
Taffeta, flat crepe, marocain and all the
specialised weaves that one time came
to us through cocoon out of mulberry-
leaf (pardon, but Race Week is just
around the corner) are now made for
our delight in factories from the acetate
and the viscose threads. If you have a
thirst for knowledge, the first is a linen
thread, the second a fibre originally
obtained from seaweed, but now drawn
from many wood pulps. The soothing
balm is applied by the voice of the shop-
keeper who tells us “the price is so much
cheaper,” but still the figures on the
ticket of any enviable piece of material
make the hand of the wage-earner shake.
Already Sydney is brimming over with
race visitors, and throughout the week
there’s to be a welter of charity balls and
private parties. The after-races shivoo
at the Australian Club next Saturday is
the one for which the sex is sleuthing
tickets. This is the first time the club
has entertained Eve, and something tells
me we’d all be there. The Union Club,
too, is busy looking up cocktail recipes,
and thinking out a color scheme for
posies—both to be served to the girl
friend on Wednesday, October 4.
“Banking, Credit and Currency” was
the subject of much lengthy and high-
brow discussion in the United Associa-
tion’s rooms last week ; but the Girl in
the Flat Opposite left the conference
early. She said she knew all she wanted
to know about it. Banking was some-
thing done by her rich friends, credit
was what she bought her clothes on,
and currency was what she hoped to have
if her belief in Chatham is justified.
The touchingly human “Breaking the
News,” painted in his early youth by
knight John Longstaff, has been sold to
the Perth Art Gallery. It was with this
picture, which has been attracting atten-
tion in the Macleod Gallery for some
time past, that the artist won the first
Australian travelling scholarship given
by the National Gallery of Victoria.
“Breaking the News” was bought by the
late William Macleod, and until the sale
to the Perth Gallery was the property
of his widow.
Artist Syd Long has been appointed a
trustee of the National Art Gallery. Syd,
a native of Goulburn, studied with Julian
Ashton. That he studied to some pur-
pose is proved by the fact that he was
just 18 when the Gallery bought his pic-
ture “The Bathers.” Later on he went
to London, stayed there 12 years, and
exhibited with the Royal Academy, the
Royal Scottish Academy and the Glas-
gow Institute.
Five women members had their say
about the Feminisation of Literature at
the F.A.W. meeting last week, and each
tackled her subject from a different
angle. In and out of the discourses of
Mrs. Holman, Florence Eldershaw, Dora
Wilcox and Nora McAuliffe humor flick-
ered, but Miles Franklin brought in
broad comedy with her shopping bag.
There was a great roll-up ; the Assembly
Hall of the Education Gallery was
filled with novelist and poet, the just-
beginning and those decked with bays.
Mary Gilmore, Louise Mack and Alice
Henry were three who returned thanks
from the centre court, and Mrs. Foster-
Mattei shot some neat balls down the
sidelines. Mere males who butted in
were out-Crawforded.
That the beauteous bush flowers take
kindly to garden cultivation is evidenced
by a waratah-tree in an Epping garden
—magnificent, just now, with 93 blooms.
Even greater than the honor of being
sought by English and American pub-
lishers, which has been paid to Austra-
lian novelist Davison’s “Man-Shy,” is
that of the request from England that
the book-makers for what the Irish call
the “dark” men and women may be
allowed to turn it into Braille.

Melbourne
Chatter
With a tally-ho and a flare of pink
Melbourne Hunt Club held a meet in
St. Kilda Town Hall for the week’s
cheeriest dance. Spotted hounds chased
one another round the gallery among
prancing hoofs and escaping quarry, and
red streamers flowed from a central
chandelier. Lady Isaacs danced in golden
draperies. Leading lights of the field
made up four sets of official lancers,
Gengoult Smith breaking the pink-coated
pattern with tails and miniatures. His
partner was Mrs. C. C. Moore, wife of
the Master, who devoted one hand to
the care of her taffeta train. Masters of
Oaklands and Findon squired Mrs.
Robertson, in black, and Mrs. Jack
Burne, who could not have worn a coat
—there was not a crumple among her
cartwheel shoulder whirls. Sandra
Shackell looked gorgeous in a gown like
white seafoam; she . carried her low
decolletage and camellias with confid-
ence. Hylda McCardel’s frock was a
grey simplicity of flowered ninon. Kath-
leen Moore was there with her fiance
Captain Tinsley.
Among those who swung through the
lancers in the country set were Mrs. Syd
Greaves, in a greeny floral frock dashed
with cherry, and green slippers; Mrs.
Gething and Mrs. Bell, who both wore
black gloves and gowns, and Miss Penne-
father,'with a line of green about the
waist of her royal-blues. White had a
great innings. Nancy Holt wore it in
satin and dashing elaborations upon
shoulder and back of pleated black
velvet. Mrs. Cozens was all white but
for her cherry fingertips. Mrs. Troedel
wore black and white hair-stripes run-
ning diagonally. Kitty Sutherland’s
silver shoes twinkled among white frills,
and she warmed her shoulders with a
little wine-shaded cape. Pink and blue
poppies were blown upon Hetty Bellair’s
white taffetas. Black lace was draped
over Hazel Menck’s pale-pink sheath.
The only purple gown had inside it Mrs.
Aubrey Gibson’s slender figure.
P.L.C. Old Girls celebrated their re-
union with dinner at the Wattle, followed
up with an invasion en masse of the
Bijou Theatre to applaud their dramatic
club’s production of “Marigold.” Kath-
leen Stobie, in white beflowered organdie,
presided at the head of the long official
table. Mrs. Gray, wife of the principal,
chose black for her frock and coat. Also
in black was Mrs. Coutts —she is presi-
dent of P.L.C.’s sister branch in Bendigo.
Among committeewomen present were
Miss A. M. Fortune, who organised the
dinner party, Mrs. Mirams, Mrs. Kitchen
and the Misses Mollison and Thomas.
Jean McClelland played Marigold in
the Arcadian piece of comedy.
There was a jingle this week in the
money-box of the orphans who live
under the wing of the Good Shepherd
sisters. The dining-room at the Windsor
was filled with music and the sort of
bridge that doesn’t bar conversation,
while players of more serious purpose
made their bids in a blossom-filled re-
ception-room. The chatty people heard
songs from Molly Warden, in sage-green,
Violet Collinson, in black velvet, Jock
Thompson and James Foran. Niches
in the exchequer were filled up nicely'
with the vending of sweets and raffle-
tickets. The flower-stall disposed of all
its choice spoil. Mrs. Prahl, who pre-
sided over the committee, wore black
and a speckled band upon her millinery.
Staff and students of the Canterbury
branch of M.L.C. had a rainless day for
their garden party. Camberwell’s
Mayoress, Mrs. Nettleton, who said nice
things about the college, was escorted
by headmistress Miss Clifton Hester.
There were tea, music and elocution, and
dancing girls transformed the lawn into
a grove outside the Parthenon.
Victoria Golf Club members downed
clubs and took up playing-cards and
bridge scorers for the Children’s Hospital.
Peach blossom and stocks shed their per-
fume around the premises. Mrs. Hore,
in short fur coat and snappy striped
hat, bossed the shivoo. Fortune smiled
upon Mrs. Gordon Farr, whose raffle
ticket brought her an attractive bag.
Clyde Old Girls danced and bridged
at Tudor Court. Mrs. S. Nicholas, who
pushes the association’s secretarial pen,
swished bark-brown laces. Mary Russel,
who also helped to oil the wheels of the
party, was festive in greens. Mrs.
Lucius Conolly tempted slimming
maidens to chew home-made sweets,
and Nancy Millear brightened their
shoulders with dewy camellias.
In Melbourne there is just opened a
salon as exclusive as the imported models
which it displays. Women who step
upon its thick carpets are enveloped in
the mellow glow of twinkly chandeliers
subdued by cream-and-gold-shot walls.
There are heavy and sumptuous silken
curtains. Some really antique chairs and
an old French screen are cleverly mingled
with modern made-to-look-olds. Fitting
rooms devoted to evening raiment are all
gilt and mirror. Offstage the models live
in corridor wardrobes where, as well
as many curtains, each gown has the
protection of a shoulder capelet made
of Japanese paper.
To open the first Australian leather
exhibition, knight William Irvine stepped
upon the dais next to a saucy waxen
wench in a scarlet suede coat and black
fez. Other models were armed with
golf clubs in gorgeous leather bags, or,
if they represented males, with boxing
gloves and face protective implements for
he-men sports. Among the thousands of
exhibits were a Texas saddle heavily em-
bossed with daisies, a dainty shoe
credited with containing 36,000 stitches,
a bush shack beside which an old trades-
man displayed his skill at making stock-
whips, and much beautiful upholstery.
In contrast to the hide of an unnamed
beast of vast proportions, hard and stiff
as wood, were some delicately colored
specimens under glass. Soft and pliable
as cowskin, they were examples of the
tanners’ methods upon human epidermis.
A ski-ing girl in black and an all-green
aviatrix were the snappiest samples in
a mannequin parade of leather garments
and footwear.
The profile limned by a Lafayette
camera that punctuates this paragraph
belongs to Nancy Finn, a twinkling star
of the Cairns Memorial Players. She
will appear this week as the maid in
Rudulph Besier’s “Secrets,” where most
of her work is centred in the 1865 act.
She had a recent triumph as Miss Cush-
ing in “Street Scene,” and has had some
successes as a play-producer.
Delia Ursula and E. T. Con-
foy were wedded upon a recent evening.
The bridal satins were swept by quan-
tities of tulle veil and trails of blossom.
Two attendants carried feather fans
against their strawberry velvet frocks.
Four small boys paged in strawberry
velvet pants and white silk blouses, the
same toning being used for the frock of
the wee trainbearer, in velvet to her toes
and with a wreath of buds in her hair.
Toasts were at the Oriental.
Godfrey Ellis waited at Melbourne
Grammar School chapel for Sylvia
Ward, who stepped up an aisle trans-
formed for the evening into a pathway of
flowering blossom. The bride’s ivory
satins swirled from a panelled corsage
into a full skirt and train. Attached to
a coronet of buds was the beauty of
Limerick lace veil (lent by Mrs. Percy
Howard) over a wraith of tulle. Ruth
Ward, Jean Carter and Margaret
Graham merged into a cloud of pinky
crinkled ninon. Much frilling and little
fluttery capes adorned their frocks, and
their hair was garlanded with sweet-peas,
pansies and hyacinths. The cake was
cut at the Hawthorn home of the bride’s
parents.
The smile belongs to Mrs. T. J. Ryan,
helmsman of the Queensland Tourist
Bureau. In 18 months she has made of
this office a wide-awake source of in-
formation for would-be travellers to the
Barrier Reef and other northern beauty
spots. Although holding a responsible
position for the Bananaland Government
she makes time to help along a number
of charities. She is the widow of T. J.
Ryan, who followed his Queensland
Premiership with an excursion into
Federal politics.
The W. B. Mclnnes family is home
after seven months abroad. In the five
sittings Mr. Mclnnes was granted for
his portrait of the Duke of York, he
found his royal subject tractable and con-
siderate. The picture goes to the Castle-
maine Art Gallery, where it will hang
opposite James Quinn’s portrait of the
Duchess. While her husband was busy
with his palette Mrs. Mclnnes educated
her offspring upon historical buildings
and the English countryside.
Perth’s plenitude of parties:
Mount Yokine Golf Club let down its gaily-
striped verandah blinds and installed twinkly
colored lights, carnations, ageratum and
gladoli for its yearly hop. Huge logs, burning
in both lounges, lit up the gold and blue fur-
nishings and attracted many chilled souls to the
fireplaces. Ladies’ committee president Mrs.
W. S. Evans gave instructions in blush-pink
ninon wrought with silver; Mrs. Chappell
wound a billiard-green sash over her ivory silk
nets; gold discs appeared on Mrs. Charles
King’s black fisher-net; Mrs. Kevin Kelly’s
frothy bridal chiffons were strewn with seed
pearls, and Mrs. Hall’s organdies were checked
green and white.
’Roo paws and pussy-willow vied with
garden flowers at the Karrakatta Club dance,
President Mrs. S. J. Anderson, with v.-p. Mrs.
John Forrest, shook hands with the arrivals.
Cards were shuffled in the visitors’ room and
dancers sat out in the winter-garden. Mrs.
A. C. Davidson struck a Parisian note with
lacquered floral chiffons, black organdie and
brown fur; Mrs. C. P. Smith’s black georg-
ettes were threaded and beaded in gold; opal
satin glimmered under Mrs. Max Rutter’s
sequined cape; Thelma Arbarson’s floral
organdies billowed copiously, and Kathie
Cooper, Dickie Broadfoot and Dorothy Bal-
ston chose varying hues of pink.
A much-feted visitor from Sydney is bank-
manager A. C. Davidson’s wife, who is busily
renewing friendships made in this State. Mrs.
J. J. Mahood’s morning tea was served ’mid
golden-brown nasturtiums and calendulas, which
harmonised with her brown and beige wool
de Chine and lace; Miss Habgood clattered
cups at the Savoy in graceful black silk velvet,
and the Wittenoom lady entertained in her
charming West Perth home. Mrs. Davidson
returned hospitality at the Karrakatta Club,
where she chatted in smartly-cut brown-and-
white broken-check tweeds, with matching
swagger coat and fez.
Miss Dannat, St. Mary’s C.E.G.S. principal,
donned delphinium blue georgette to hostess
the O.G.A. dance. Secretary Erica Hall
strapped herself into cherry ring velvet; Nancy
Griffiths wafted black flowered taffetas; Muriel
Broom’s creamy organdies were shelfed and
crinkled.
The Aero Club put on a non-stop variety
affair at the Pleiades Club, starting with
knock-out bridge, traversing puzzles and
novelty games, and winding up with dancing.
Flyer Nell Nanford was there in clinging
beige ,laces; Joyce Burridge skipped about in
cornflower-blue Chantilly.
Newspaper House Art Gallery showed the
combined work of Mrs. Margaret Johnson,
Miss F. Hall, Portia Bennett and Muriel
Southern. Pencil, oils and water-colors were
displayed, and there was a section devoted to
craft work. Dr. Roberta Jull, after an intro-
duction by Mrs. H. Davis, launched the exhibi-
tion.
The University Choral Society scored a suc-
cess with the large audience at Winthrop Hall.
Edward Black’s prize-winning composition had
its first W.A. audition, with the composer at
the piano and Lio Chase wielding the fiddle-
bow. The choir warbled under A. J. Leckie’s
guidance, and Gladys Cunliffe and Jean Norman
simultaneously tapped the ivories of two pianos.
The diversions of Adelaide:
The Pied Piper party organised by the Junior
Red Cross was a great success. Mrs. Laving-
ton Bonython and Nora Stewart acted as
judges for the fancy costumes. W. Runge
played the part of Piper, his sack full of sugar
rats, which soon disappeared. Acting-Mayor
and Mayoress Cain were there, Mrs. Cain in
black chiffon velvet. Pupils of Miss Stewart
performed a bird ballet, and Jim Muecke did
conjuring tricks.
Every table was booked for the opening of
the new Apollo Restaurant at Myer’s. Norman
Myer donated the whole of the takings to the
Free Kindergartens. Mrs. Lavington Bonython,
Mrs. R. K. Wood and Mrs. Albyn Rankine
arranged the floral decorations; window-
boxes filled with pink and white flowering
peach looked delightful. There was a manne-
quin parade, “Fashions down the Ages,’’
arranged by Mesdames Lavington Bonython
and Lloyd Tolley, and two dance items, “The
Naughty ’Nineties,” by pupils of Dorothy Slanc,
and the “Twentieth Century Blues,” in which
pupils of Nora Stewart performed. Lady Hore-
Ruthven was present and was entertained at
afternoon tea by Mrs. Bonython, who had a
party of about 20.
There was a big crowd at the Empire Ball,
held in Unley City Hall. Returned men did
the decorations under Mrs. Dollman’s super-
vision. His Ex. was present.
The Creswell lady, of Melbourne, is in Adel-
aide on a visit to her brother and his wife,
Mr. and Mrs. Percival Stow, and her sister
Miss E. Stow. She is staying at the Queen
Adelaide Club.
From across Bass Strait:
The Bush Nursing Association staged a
shivoo at Hobart Town Hall in honor of his
Ex. and Lady Clark. President Mrs. John
Downie and other officers received the v.-r.
party. A guard of honor was formed of all
the youngsters who had figured as “Bush
Nursing Queens” to raise funds.
The Girl Guides organised a bridge party and
dance to raise the wind for building a mountain
shelter on land given by a friend some time ago.
The Masonic Hall was filled—dancing in the
main hall, bridge in the long downstair room
and supper in its lawful place. The Governor
and his lady had a guard of honor of Guides,
who lined the staircase, and spring blooms cast
a golden glow over the supper tables.
Mrs. J. G. Mitchell held a reception at her
Jericho home to give the folk of that district
an opportunity of meeting Lady Clark, who
motored up from town. Primroses and violets
decked the big rooms at Ellesmere. Guests
included Mesdames R. O’Kelly, Askin-Morrison,
Bisdee, Burbury, C. Gibson, E. O. Bisdee, C.
Archer, Page, Russell Ibbott, Watchorn, Burgess,
Temple, Ivo Agnew, Page, Lester, Scott and
Strickland.
For St. Pat.’s College Ball, Launceston,
decorations had an Oriental tinge. Archbishop
Hayden went up from Hobart. The Mayoress
was in beige lace and georgette. Fancy ballets
were danced during the evening.
Mrs. W. Roberts threw open her charming
rooms at Beaumaris for bridge parties in the
afternoon and evening in aid of the Clarendon
Children’s Home. The rooms were ablaze
with spring flowers. Twenty tables were
occupied.
Commander Ivan Whitehorn, R.N., and Mrs.
Whitehorn are spending three months with the
T. W. H. Clarkes, of Quorn Hall, Campbell
Town. Mrs. Whitehorn was Rhonda Clarke,
the eldest daughter.
Jean, daughter of the late A. Stephens, and
of Mrs. Lansdell, the Rectory, Deloraine, and
Tim Archer, Morelands, Kimberly, are recent
entrants for the matrimonial stakes.

“Welsh Bridge”: As to the pronun-
ciation of “eisteddfod’ (B. 30/9/ 33).
Writer was at a West of England school
thickly infested with Welsh youths from
over the adjacent border; They invari-
ably pronounced the word “eisteffoth,
and I have always been content to let
it go at that. In any case, it was never
politic to argue that or any other point
with them, for they were a peppery lot.

“Carnoustie”: Some time ago The
Bulletin chronicled the feat of one
Bruce Sutherland, .of Scotland, in play-
ing 14 rounds of golf in 234 hours,
caddies carrying acetylene lamps to
guide him through the night. . He covered
close on 50 miles .on a hilly exact-
ing course to carry out his seltVimposed
task of setting up a world’s golf-endur-
ance record, and it is not surprising to
hear that he recently dropped dead of
heart failure while playing. Golf takes
a Tot more out of one than the casual
observer would imagine, as many have
found to their cost.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: After staving off . the
evil day for years. Essex county
cricketers have been compelled by haid
times to relinquish the ground at Leyton
which has been their headquarters tor
-many a day. There are several others
of the lesser counties in the same fix,
and, like Essex, they may.be compelled
to play the county fixtures away; trom
home as an alternative to. throwing, up
the sponge. These counties have for
years existed only by the profits made
on the visits of the Australian teams, and
this explains the eagerness to let body-
line barges be bygones and to extend
a welcome to the next lot of money-
spinners from down under.
“Whizz”: The Monza Grand Prix
meeting in Italy was responsible for one
of the worst smashes in the history of
European car racing, three of the com-
petitors being killed and several injured.
The killed were Campari and Borzac-
chini, Italy’s leading drivers, who col-
lided in the second heat of the
63-kilometre race with three other cars,
and Count Czaikowski, of Poland. Ihe
Count had won the first heat, and was
killed in the final by his car overturning
at the place of the first smash. The race
went on, however, the ultimate winner
being the French driver Lehoux. The
Monza itself, over 500 kilometres, was
won by Fagioli,:driving an Alfa-Romeo,
at an average of 174.74.k.p.h. .

< “Exul”: 1 agree with “Lao-dah” when
he'says that the evil influence of opium
is absurdly exaggerated. I know a bed-
ridden man afflicted with a painful
complaint who started taking half a
grain of morphia nightly 15 years ago,
and who still takes the same dose. He
is a keen student, and the drug has no
adverse effect on his thinking powers ;
it merely makes his evenings moderately
comfortable. Addiction is most easily
acquired when the drug is injected hypo-
dermically, but some years ago Dr. W.
E. Dixon, of Cambridge University,
showed by experiment that it had to be
injected into normal persons in increas-
ing doses daily for not less than 120
days before they, found the least diffi-
culty in breaking the habit off. The
truth is that addiction .to opium, alcohol
or .'any other drug is almost always a
symptom -of, an ‘ unstable mind seeking
any refuge from trouble, or boredom. A
normal' person " with , a healthy attitude
towards'life runs very little danger ol
becoming a slave, to any of these friends
of man if he uses them as; they should
be used. -


The Tobacco-jar.
BY MARGARET FANE AND HILARY LOFTING.
on in, dad,” Milly said in
I her pleasant, kindly way from
the front doorway. “The heat’s
all out of the sunshine now —at least, it
is for you.”
Dad blinked and got stiffly off the
gasbox. Milly was right. She always
was. He’d been dozing on the box and
hadn’t noticed —why, you could feel the
chill in the air. He blinked again, and
came slowly down the narrow verandah
to Milly in the doorway. That was the
end of Hulk-street and the drowsy noises
of the ’Loo for to-day.
Milly took his arm, her firm, whole-
some hand feeling like a rock and mak-
ing him stop shuffling at once. “There
you are,” she said, and piloted him gently
into the hall and round the sharp corner.
“All comfy and quiet and waiting for
you.”
Old Noddy Colin looked at it as she
disengaged her hand. There was that
stink —no, there wasn’t; that was imagi-
nation. There was a bit of a fire and
his armchair and the little table —all cor-
rect and exactly where they should be.
Those big double doors led into the
dining-room ; this was the little sitting-
room end, and it belonged to him, to
Noddy Colin. He ran his eye over it
again.
The eye reached a tobacco-jar on the
corner of the mantelshelf and flickered
in pained surprise. “Grrumph”.... dad
said.
Milly glanced anxiously from him to
this jar, smiled and apologised. “I’m
sorry, dad.” She took it down from the
shelf and placed it carefully on the little
table equidistant from the box of
matches and the pipe. “There. I was
dusting and thinking of something else,
and I forgot to put it back. A place for
everything and everything in its place—
what a one you are, aren’t you?”
He grunted again and settled slowly
into the armchair, the wandering eye
now satisfied and at rest on the tobacco-
jar in its place. His daughter waited an-
other moment, her affectionate eyes
watching him. “You’re all right now,
aren’t you, dad dear? You have a good
rest and smoke your pipe. You’ve had
a long day in the sun ; and it’ll be tea-
time before you know where you are.”
At the doorway she smiled again,
glanced at the fire, was gone.
He supposed so. You sat in the sun
and dozed a bit, and then you sat by
the fire and smoked your pipe and dozed
a bit. This was a good crib he had
here ; all his own, too —no one had the
hide to come in here and disturb him or
to muck the place about. He blew out
his shrunken cheeks and looked at the
little table. The fire was taking the
chill out of his bones. It was a good
crib, warm and safe.
He took the lid off the tobacco-jar and
began slowly to fill the pipe. Young
Dave had given him this pipe on his
70th birthday. Seventy.... Lots of men
were doing a good day’s work and earn-
ing a living at 70. So they should —ordi-
nary men. Three shreds of tobacco spilt
on the tablecloth ; he picked them up
carefully and put them into the pipe.
The shadowy smell seemed to rise again,
the smell of concrete and disinfectant
with a touch of whitewash ; but the cloud
of smoke from his pipe smothered it.
Besides, it wasn’t really there.
His thoughts wandered upon half-
nebulous journeys for a moment, stirred
into this vagrant life by the cold smell
that haunted his nostrils, though it wasn’t
there. Milly was a good girl—you
wouldn’t find a better —time she was
married and got a good man of her own.
Like her mother, she was —quiet and
always giving. There were always lots
ready to go on taking while she gave,
too, himself among the rest. And here
he was at 70 with his warm, comfortable
crib, still doing it, only it was Milly now
and not Mary. Well, he was always a
hard-doer; you had to take ’em as they
came. But he always paid for it.
The tobacco faintly drugged him and
took him a little further afield upon these
shapeless journeys. Backward, to Mary’s
face, and, for no reason, to Bathurst.
You got a quarter-pound of sugar a
week at Bathurst; and tea, too ; more
like a home than a gaol, Bathurst was.
He ought to know; four stretches he’d
done there. He was there when the boy
was born, Dave’s brother, who was born
dead and nearly killed Mary. It was a
good thing he was there, too; if he’d
been in Parramatta he’d have found
some way of making an end of it; they
weren’t as careful as they made out to
be, even in a hell of a hole like Parra-
matta. Dad’s mild face hardened as he
remembered the one stretch in Parra-
matta.
There was something he must get to
before his pipe was finished —something
serious. The thoughts shaped for a
moment; but presently they fell apart
and floated away on their own wayward
tides of memory. Bathurst started one
of them, and Mary’s face came into it;
all that strain which had seemed like the
end of the world boiled round him again.
He was never one for permanent skirts ;
a hard-doer, he was. And, what’s more,
he was 40 when he first saw Mary. But
that settled it; seemed to open up the
world, the sight of her did. He had
dropped the game like a hot brick —he,
Noddy Colin —(“If you’re not careful
you’ll find yourself declared an habitual
criminal”) —because she didn’t like the
game. They got married.
This space of the past came round
him in a gentle quietude. The job he
got, and the kick in making a go of it;
the sweetness of Mary waiting at home
for him; the feeling you were getting
somewhere, and yet that it didn’t matter
if you didn’t get there. He wanted a son
and Mary wanted a son ; all-out they
wanted a son. And then he’d flopped.
Easy money because there was a baby
on the way—that was only an excuse ;
it was the game that got him again. And
it was easy money; but he’d lost his
touch and they copped him. On his first
shot, back in the game. His only
shot
That tide went out to sea, became part
of the sea, came drifting back. There
he was in Bathurst, and Mary dying in
Sydney, and the son dead. You wouldn’t-
believe it The walls of the comfort-
able crib rolled back, the double doors
and the little table and the fire ; in their
place a cell drowned in that stink shut
him in once more in hate and terror and
a wild helplessness. He had done it;
the shock of him and Bathurst and the
game had caused the premature birth.
That was the first she’d heard of the
game
He stared at this for a long moment,
sucking his pipe. There it was. You
couldn’t alter it, or do anything with it.
But there was something else, something
important, that he’d got to tackle soon.
Out on the gasbox there he knew he’d
have to come to it to-day. What was
it?
But this other tide slipped in between
again. Half-asleep, he felt it drifting
round him. She didn’t die, and that was
the last she heard of the game as well
as the first. He dropped it then for good.
And Milly was born, and, seven years
afterwards, Dave, the son. Then Mary
did die.
Dave.... The sun and the moon and
the stars, as they said. The smell floated
softly into the crib again, but the
thoughts began to take shape. Dave’d
put it right—if it wanted putting right;
you took ’em as they came. Dave was
one of the quiet ones, too, like Mary —
one of the givers, those who got it in
the neck from the takers, like Mary did.
First, he was a flower in Mary’s arms ;
then a hell of a noise about the house;
then a serious lad ; then, in no time, a
serious young man with a job and a
girl
Dad carefully tapped the ash out of
his pipe into the bowl and sat up, his
face hardening again. This was it. This
was the something he had been half-
dodging while he dozed and dreamed.
That was why....
It didn’t matter how you looked at it,
there wasn’t any other way. Stink or
no stink.
Dave wasn’t going to get it in the neck.
He’d see to that. A certain grimness, an
old hard echo of other years, as it were,
sharpened dad’s figure, sitting upright
now, and banished these wandering
thoughts. There was a job of work to
do—to think out first, and then to do.
Murder. That’s what the jury’d call
it. And that’s what it was, too. But
they wouldn’t stretch his neck at his age.
He’d get what amounted to a lifer ; a
few years of the stink it would be. And
then the end.
He looked round the comfortable
corner for a moment but with no soften-
ing of the implacable glitter that had
come into his eyes. They were old eyes
that had suffered and learned and found
peace ; but now they were deep, steady,
merciless.
The other side of those double doors
was the dining-room, just across from
the kitchen. That was where the young-
sters had their good times while dad sat
dozing in his crib here in the quiet, shut
in in ordered monotony, but able to
get out if he wanted t 0.... Pretty quiet
the youngsters’d be in the dining-room,
mostly, though sometimes they did have
their high-jinks with a cobber or two.
Milly’d be busy over a bit of knitting
or sewing, and Dave’d be deep in one of
his books —engineering books, mechanics
and that; it was out of them that he’d
invented this gadget for motor-turntables
or whatever it was. He could always
see the youngsters of an evening by look-
ing at the double doors.
Or maybe Nella, Dave’s girl, would
step in for a yarn, and you’d hear her
light, quick voice and the tinkle of tea-
cups. She was a good girl, Nella, pretty
as a picture, and sound. If she got a
fair go she’d give Dave one and make
him happy; but she was young, and a
bit too light and quick as yet in herself
as well as in her voice. Dave didn’t
reckon his job was good enough to get
married on —couldn’t give enough on
that —and this was holding it up. It
didn’t do for things to be held up.
Or maybe this Dick Overley would
come in. With Nella. He did a good
bit of coming in lately, Dad ruminated,
his face stony and set. He had never
been a killer yet, though he’d been ready
for it often enough. This was one of the
times when he was ready for it. Secrets,
and dodging here and there with Dave’s
girl, and Dave getting more and more
thoughtful, keeping his mouth shut more
and more, every day. Oh, he could see,
if he was old and shaky after a hard life.
There was only one way out of it.
Nella wasn’t really stuck on this smooth-
spoken, easy-mannered fellow with his
stand-offish ways (damn him); it was
Dave she’d set her heart on. It wouldn’t
matter to her if this Overley got bumped
off, as they called it now. Milly wouldn’t
have to go on looking after the old man
when she ought to be married. All the
old time would come out at the trial;
so Dave wouldn’t care —or he wouldn’t
be surprised or shocked, anyhow. It
would be what you’d expect from Noddy
Colin, the old gaolbird. It was a good
way out of it; and it was the only way.
There was his Colt upstairs in his
room —40 years old it was, but in pretty
good trim. He liked to keep things in
good trim. And the sooner the better.
The stink rushed, suffocating, at him ;
but dad opened his nostrils and stared,
indifferent and unrepentant, down the
future. Dave, Dave, his mind said as a
stiffener every now and
“Why, dad dear, you look all perked
up. What’s happened you?” Milly’s
soothing voice seemed to warm the room
though the fire was still going strong.
“Been thinkin’,” he told her. ‘What’s
for tea?”
She laughed, balancing the tray by
its edge on the little table. “Chop,
potatoes, green peas,” she said, “and a
rice pudding. All hot, so don’t waste
time looking at them.” She moved the
pipe, ash-bowl, matches and tobacco-jar
carefully to the back of the table and set
the tray before him. “There. But you’ve
lost 10 years in the last hour and a half
—how did you manage it?”
“Been thinkin’,” he repeated.
She laughed again. “I wish I could
do it as easily. You are a one, aren’t
you?”
Without bothering to reply to this, dad
took his knife and fork.
At the door she turned. “I brought
your tea a bit early to-day, dear,” she
said. “Nella and Dick are having tea
with us to-night, and I wanted the stove
clear.”
To this also he made no reply, his
mouth being full.
At the gentle closing of the door, he
put down his knife and fork. Nella and
Dick. And Dick. To-night.
The sooner the better.
To-night.
After tea he’d get his Colt. Dave’s girl.
Yes. That was it. Take it on the run.
Many a weary day and weary night in
this stink he’d been sorry he’d sat and
looked at a thing. Take everything on the
run.
His cold implacable eyes looked indif-
ferently round the cosy room until the
indifference became a vast contempt.
Dave’s girl.
He picked up his knife and fork again.
Food was food, for this meal. To-morrow
it wouldn’t be food. In a tranquil delib-
eration he continued and finished his tea.
This done, with equal deliberation he
went upstairs to his bedroom for the Colt,
and came down again to wait. Milly
had taken the tray away and switched on
the light; the crib was all set, as comfort-
able as could be, for the evening. He
walked across the room and let himself
slowly down into the armchair, an old
rugged man, pitiless and unrepentant, a
killer for this last job in the world. Death
was in his pocket, remorseless death in his
steady hands, in his stilled inevitable eyes.
Waiting was long. It always had been
—every minute an hour. That was
imagination. But Milly put her head
round the door.
“I can’t think what’s happened to Dick
and Nella,” she said anxiously. “They’re
nearly half an hour late. I hope noth-
ing’s wrong.”
She glanced at the fire and went back
to the kitchen.
A sharp panic seized him. He was too
late.... The smooth-spoken, easy-man-
nered man had got away with Dave’s
girl That was it. They were off and
away to hell-and-gone by this.
That’s what you got for looking at a
job instead of bogging in. He ought to
have got to the job last week when he
had the chance; now there was no
chance....
A stir and a light, quick voice in the
passage made him look up, made his hag-
gard eyes grim and stern once more. No ;
not too late....
He waited for the noises to subside and
sound again behind the double-doors
before he got up, put his hand carefully
into his coat-pocket, and walked out into
the passage.
At the dining-room doorway he
paused, watching them. There they were
—Dave quiet, with a finger in his book,
looking at Nella’s flushed face and hear-
ing her excited talk ; Milly cutting bread
at the table ; and this Dick Overley---
easy, laughing and with a sort of half-
shyness put 0n.... Dad’s hard gaze
rested on his face, saw his glance at Milly,
saw him smile.... The hand in the
pocket flexed and hardened again. Not
too late.
But only just in time. Nella’s lit glow-
ing face, the talk bubbling out of her
nineteen to the dozen, and this waster
smiling and looking sheepish—it was as
plain as a pikestaff. Dave’s girl. The
fingers closed in in the pocket——
“Oh, daddy”—Nella saw him in the
doorway—“listen. I’ve got a secret to tell
you—at least it isn’t a secret now. You
know that patent piston of Dave’s?”
Dad stared at her without speaking.
“Well, Dick knows the manager of the
Autocraft Company and —well, / pinched
the drawings and Dick stalked this
manager for a month and cornered him
to-day.” She paused, her eyes alight.
“He’s putting the gadget on the market.
And he wants Dave in his office! To sit
and think and invent! What do you
think of that? Coming to a wedding-
party, daddy?”
The room’s tide of jubilation seemed to
roar at dad and drown him. Presently
he was aware that he was peering into
Dick Overley’s face. Overley laughed and
flushed.
“You’re wondering why / butted in,”
he said. “I thought it was up to me.
Milly wouldn’t look at me until Dave was
fixed up, so I had to try to”
Dad found himself stumbling out into
the passage. Not again would that stink
come haunting him Let him get to
the good crib again, the dear corner of
safety and quiet and freedom. Shaking
waves of relief came flooding over him.
He saw nothing of Milly following him,
nothing of anything save the corner and
the little table, the match-box, the ash-
bowl. No stink, ever again....
He reached the armchair, anxious Milly
beside him. Suddenly he turned on her,
a snarling fury.
“What the hell d’you mean by moving
my blasted tobacco-jar again?” he
demanded.
Milly blanched, dumbfounded. Fancy
dad! “I’m sorry, dear,” she faltered. “I
was fussed with getting tea and I must
have moved it when I took away your
tray.” She took it off the mantelshelf
and put it back on the little table.
“Grrumph”.... dad said, letting him-
self tenderly down into the chair with a
sigh of relief.
Lethe.
The tides of restlessness surge
Through the gloomy caverns of my brain—•
Twist and swirl and turn upon themselves again,
Their torrents dammed within that narrow
sphere.
Until at last, in fear,
I seek escape,
And plunge into the sea:
There to be lost
In a wild chaos
That thunders out its sullen rage,
Beneath the brazen dome of sky.
Or if poised above some cliff
The winds go rushing by,
1 am caught
Up and tossed
On a storm of flying thought;
Sleep brings no rest,
But leaves the mind a burnt-out brand,
Seared by an emotion
It knew not for its own.
Oh! that I might lie in a beechen wood,
Between grey wraiths of trees,
Where the leaves’ green light sinks slowly down,
Till its cool green tide sweeps through my brain,
Like a worn skull lost
In the shallows of the sea.

A MELODRAMA OF HOPELESS LOVE, BY J. B. BLAIR.
[Editorial note: The Bulletin has frowned on melodrama, but, in view of the high
social position of the parties, it has decided to make an exception in this case.]
££ r T' IHEN,” l HEN,” murmured Sir Despard
I Bar-Sinister to the pulsing arm-
ful of femininity which he was
clasping to him, “you do love me?”
“More than anything on earth,” she
whispered into his waistcoat. “More than
life itself.”
Sir Despard jerked her head back
suddenly and kissed her savagely again
and again upon her full red lips—lips
which would have well deserved the term
luscious had they belonged to any but
I Ermyntrude Postlethwaite, daughter of
I the president of the Association for the
Suppression of Vice.
For half an hour or more they re-
mained thus. Then Ermyntrude, taking
! advantage of his momentary pause for
! breath, said gently, “Dearest, let’s be
married in September, when the winter
is past and the rain is over and gone,
when birds sing and the voice of the
turtle is heard in the land.”
Sir Despard shuddered. A look of
horror came over his face.
“I didn’t suggest marrying you,” he
replied harshly.
Ermyntrude looked up at him in
amazement.
“But,” she protested, “you spoke of
the wonderful life we would have to-
gether—of our journey through the
Orient, our tour of Europe, our life in
England in your ancestral halls.”
“Yes, of course, and we shall have all
that. But I cannot marry you.”
“Then how can we” began the
bewildered girl. Then, realising all at
‘once his meaning, she burst into tears
of shame and despair.
“No, not that,” she sobbed. “Oh,
Despard, and father thinks you’re such
a perfect gent.—an Englishman of the
old school and a man of honor; yet
you dare to come to me with such a
shameful suggestion! A suggestion,”
she concluded, breaking away from him
and rising to her feet, “which reflects
upon me and upon my whole sex, and
reveals you for the cold, calculating
scoundrel that you are. Go ere I call
my brothers to give you the sound thrash-
ing you deserve!”
For Ermyntrude was well versed in
modern uplift drama, and knew her lines
well.
But Despard missed his cue. Accord-
ing to all the best authorities he should
have slunk away, cowed. Instead, he
seized her hand.
“Ermyntrude,” he said, “you don’t
understand. Far from my proposal dis-
honoring you, your proposal dishonors
me. You spoke of my ancestry. I am
proijd of it. The blood of a king runs
in my veins. I am descended from
Richard Cceur-de-Lion.”
“You don’t say so?” Ermyntrude mur-
mured.
“I do say so,” he replied firmly. “Not
from his wife, mind you, but from a'
beautiful woman whom he loved as I
love you. Away with your marriage cere-
mony! There has not been a marriage in
our family for over six hundred years.
Far be it from me, the only surviving
member of the race, to begin now.
“Believe me,” he proceeded, “I love
and honor you. It will not be as bad
as you think. The world will look upon
you as my wife; even the Law will
fancy you are my wife. Only you and
I need know the truth. It is merely a
matter of convincing your own con-
science.”
“No, I can’t, I can’t!” she sobbed. •
“But, come ; my mother did it, and
my grandmother ; in fact, all my female
ancestors. You say you love me. Then
what else matters?”
“No! My conscience won’t allow me
to agree to your suggestion. I can see
now that you are quite in earnest, and
do not mean to insult me, but, surely,
if you love me my wishes should come
before those of your mouldy ancestors.”
But Sir Despard was not to be moved.
At least, not much.
“If you are worrying about your
father or your friends,” he said, “I
can soon make that right. We can have
an apparent wedding ceremony any-
where you like, with as many brides-
maids as you like, provided I supply the
parson.”
“But you said”
“Of course I did. The parson won’t
be a parson. Therefore, the wedding
won’t be a wedding. Geoffrey Gadfly
will do it for us. I’ve already told your
father that he is in holy orders. A small
gift to the registrar, and no one will be
any the wiser. Except us, of course.”
“But that would be sacrilege.”
“To the orthodox, yes. To me, no!
For I shall know that I have not failed
my ancestors. Now, come, darling, say
that you’ll agree.”
“No, I cannot. I couldn’t bring my-
self to it. What would my poor dear
father think?”
“He won’t know. Only you and 1
will know.”
“And Geoffrey?”
“Geoffrey’s quite safe ; he won’t tell.
Now, think it over. Give me your answer
to-morrow.”
* * # *
Simple maidens would find it very
difficult to solve their problems were it
not for more subtle friends.
On the morrow Ermyntrudc poured
out her woes to Alicia Fitzhardinge, who
at once suggested a simple solution.
“Have the wedding at St. Jonathan’s.
It’s so dark there that you can’t see the
parson at any time. I’ll get Geoffrey
out of the way and arrange for the old
vicar to be there at the last minute on
the plea that the other man is indis-
posed. The vicar will tie the knot, and
then you’ll be well and truly married.”
“No,” replied Ermyntrude. “My con-
science wouldn’t let me do that. It
would be deceiving Despard. No, I
must refuse him, although it will break
my heart.
“Besides,” she added, “he’d be bound
to find out.”
“Rot!” retorted Alicia. “You must
consent. As for deceiving Despard, he’ll
be quite happy and ignorant about it
all. Both parties will be satisfied. Peace
with honor, and all that. And don’t
worry about Geoffrey. I can twist him
round my little finger. Go to it, Ermyn-
trude! Those ancestral halls are yours.”
“Oh, well,” replied Ermyntrude
meekly, “I suppose you know best,
Alicia. You’re so much cleverer than
1. But I’m sure I don’t know what my
poor dear father would think.”
* =l= * *
The wedding day dawned bright and
clear. It was September, and, as Ermyn-
trude had prophesied, the winter was
over and gone. The birds were bursting
on every bough. [Correction: The birds
were bursting into song on every bough.]
And, if it had been given a proper
chance, it is even possible that the voice
of the turtle might have been heard in
the land. But, unfortunately, any attempt
it may have made was drowned by the
din of the excited voices of the huge
crowd that thronged the approaches of
St. Jonathan’s, by the tooting of motor-
horns and the sharp, staccato tones of
the traffic police.
Never was there such a bride as
Ermyntrude. A murmur of admiration
went through the church as, accompanied
by fourteen bridesmaids, two flower-girls
and a train-bearer, she swept up the dim
aisle on the arm of her father, the presi-
dent of the Association for the Suppres-
sion of Vice.
Mr. Postlethwaite was beaming with
gratification at the knowledge that his
daughter was marrying into a family so
notable among the English landed gentry.
Standing there in the semi-darkness, Sir
Despard looked almost handsome, and
Postlethwaite’s bosom swelled with pride.
Ermyntrude trembled as she reached
her lover’s side, and gazed anxiously at
the surpliced figure before them. She
gave a sigh of relief. Yes, sure enough,
it was the vicar. Alicia had done her
part well.
The ceremony began. Sir Despard
uttered his responses in a clear voice.
“By Jove,” he thought, “old Geoffrey
can certainly act. I doubt whether the
parson himself could carry it off better.’
In the vestry afterwards, during the
signing of the register, Sir Despard could
scarcely keep himself from slapping
Geoffrey on the back and congratulat-
ing him verbally on the excellence of his
performance; but the presence of Mr.
Postlethwaite restrained him. When the
vicar, shaking the bridegroom by the
hand, ventured a few advisory remarks
on the happiness of married couples, he
felt that Geoffrey was going a bit too
far. However, just then the organ broke
forth into the “Wedding March,” and
the bridal party made an impressive exit.
As the happy couple moved away in
Sir Despard’s high-powered limousine
many were the good wishes showered
upon them. It may truly be said that
never had the bells of old St. Jonathan s
pealed forth so blithe a peal.

he and his bride had taken up their
temporary residence pending their de-
parture for England. It was late in the
evening, and he had been in but a few
minutes.
Ermyntrude was absent at her old
school, addressing the Junior Debating
Society on “Woman’s Place Is in the
Home.”
A door opened silently and a woman
entered. It was Alicia Fitzhardinge!
Sir Despard rose to the feet. “What
madness is this?” he demanded. “Why
do you follow me so? Have you no
regard for common decency? Suppos-
ing Ermyntrude should come home, as
she may at any moment.”
“Yes,” she replied bitterly. “You say
that now. But it wasn’t always so.
Before I introduced you to Ermyntrude
you were crazy about me.”
“Perhaps so, but that is over. Re-
member, I am married.”
Alicia laughed mockingly. “Of course,
I’ll remember it, and so will you.”
“What do you mean?” he queried,
seizing her by the wrists. “You’ve got
something to tell me. Out with it!
What do you mean?”
Alicia struggled fiercely but could not
loosen his grip upon her. At last she
shrieked out, her voice vibrating with
hatred.
“I’ll tell you what I mean! You are
married! Geoffrey Gadfly was with me,
twenty miles from the church, when you
took your vows. You were married by
the vicar of St. Jonathan’s. Now, take
that, Sir Despard Bar-Sinister.”
“Oh, my God!” cried Sir Despard,
flinging her violently from him. “You
fiend! You’ve ruined me!”
.So terrible was his wrath that the un-
happy woman could face him no longer.
She turned and fled.
Sir Despard sank into an armchair
with his head in his hands in an attitude
of utter despair. Married! To think
that he, the last of his line, should have
come to this!
Presently he reached the only decision
possible to him.
He rose and took something from the
drawer of his desk.
The last of the Bar-Sinisters switched
off the light and went into the bathroom.
A few moments later a shot rang out.
Sir Despard had always been a tidy
man.
* * * *
As Ermyntrude arrived home in her
single-seater a figure stepped out of the
shadows.
“Lady Bar-Sinister, I think?”
“Why, yes,” she replied. Then, recog-
nising him, “Oh, it’s the vicar! Won’t
you come in?”
They went inside.
“Sorry my husband’s not home yet,”
she remarked. “He should be in any
time now. Now, what was it you wanted
to see me about? It must be important
to bring you out at this time of night.”
“It is very important, and, I am sorry
to say, very unpleasant.”
“You frighten me ; but go on.”
“Lady Bar-Sinister, you call me the
vicar. I am not the vicar. The real vicar
oi St. Jonathan’s was my twin-brother,
whom I murdered after a foolish quarrel
forty-five years ago in China, where he 1
had gone as a missionary. 1 was un-|
known in that part of China. To con-j
ceal my crime I assumed his identity.
“Returning to Australia as my brother,
I took over his old parish. I have con-
ducted it ever since. But I have never
been ordained. I am not a minister of
religion.”
“Wretch!” Ermyntrude shrieked.
“Reproach me not,” the false vicar
said. “I can bear the torture of remorse
no longer. My mind is made up. I
intend to make a full confession and
pay the penalty of my crime.”
“And this to me?"
“Well, my dear young woman, I mar-
ried you to Sir Despard. That marriage
was illegal, like hundreds of others I
have performed. I can do nothing for
the others. But you I can help. I know
you are leaving for England this week.
Go through the ceremony again before
you leave.”
“Oh, horrible man!” cried Ermyn-
trude. “You have ruined me! Then I
am not married to Despard after all?
What will father say?”
“You can still remedy it. That is
why I told you first. Go through the
ceremony again. A registry office would
do.”
“How can I remedy the past? Away
with you, you despicable creature! I
have been living in sin, and you are the
cause! Go!”
The vicar slunk out.
Ermyntrude sank into an armchair
and sobbed as though her heart would
break.
“It is a judgment upon me,” she cried,
“for deceiving Despard. Why did I take
Alicia’s advice? I should have refused
him. Then he would have returned to
England, and I should still have been
an honest woman.”
A horrible thought struck her. Des-
pard would be back at any minute, and
they were not legally married. She could
no longer remain under his roof. Ex-
planations would be wasted, since he had
never considered the marriage a real one
nor suspected that she thought it so.
She must leave before his return.
She rushed out to her car. But where
should she go? To return to her father
was impossible. He would never under-
stand.
In despair she started the car and
drove off at a terrific speed.
Where could she go? To father?
No!
To Despard?.... No! Both equally
impossible.
Faster and faster... .anywhere would
do. Only to escape from her thoughts.
Faster and faster —her headlights pierc-
ing the darkness before her. Then a
crash, and all was darkness.
The policeman who found her re-
moved her valuables and took the body
to the watchhouse.
* * * *
“Remarkable case,” said the in-
spector to a colleague next day. “Shot
her husband in the bathroom and then
crashed while she was speeding away to
establish an alibi. Drunk, of course!
... .What will her father say?”
Reprieve.
BY CHAS. H. SHAW.
THE Gov’nor trudged along blindly,
suddenly aware of his age.
Feelings of despair and loss and
.
anger created turmoil in his breast. De-
spair, because he knew that an old man
was unlikely to find another job; loss,
because he had become a part of Why-
moul Station and it a part of him ; anger
at the reflection that this newcomer
could calmly sack him without even a
comment on his long service.
“I’m sorry, Thompson,” Arnold had
said, the declaration quite perfunctory,
“but you’re too old for work now. I
must have men who can earn their pay.
And that old dog of yours—he has be-
come useless for station work. Get your
time at the end of the month.”
Sorry, was he? Like fun, he was
sorry! A bloke that’d sack his own
brother and think nothing of it. Too
old, eh? Too old after twenty years - of
solid work.
Twenty years! Slaving when the
droughts were on till you couldn’t stand
up, cutting scrub, carting water, keeping
the stock alive. Working Sundays and all
when the years were wet and flies and
footrot kept all hands busy. Fencing and
tank-sinking and mustering. The busy
times at shearing and lamb-marking.
Why, dash his buttons, none had worked
harder than The Gov’nor!
That was how he got the name. Nolan
(poor devil!) had always told the men
to take their pace from him. “Thomp-
sons the governor on this men-dog-
horses-sheep engine of ours,” he had
said. “When he slows, we slow; when
he races, we race.” Tfu*t was in
1917, and he had been “The Gov’nor”
ever since. And now Nolan was dead,
and he was sacked, and his old dog was
useless.
Useless! Old Jack! It was hard to
take that about the best dog on Why-
moul. There he ambled now, the black
and tan hair missing in patches along
his back, his muzzle a bit withered, the
near back leg bent where that old nark
of a ram had got him years ago ; but
his bushy tail still waved erect. Per-
haps he did. knock up now when the day
was hot and the ground hard. Perhaps
he did run to the waterhole for more
drinks and more wallows than the other
dogs during hot, dusty days in the yards.
But, when it came to a pinch, he was
still the best dog on the station, and
chance it!
The Gov’nor sighed. Well, the end
had to come —he knew that —but he had
expected to die on Whymoul. That was
how it was in the old days. You worked
all your life for the station, and, when
you were too old to work any more, they
gave you a hut and rations, and you
waited in peace. Waited, with your old
horse and your old dog and your
memories, for the last mustering.
But this bloke Arnold wasn’t going
to waste hutroom and tucker on an old
codger and his dog who were no more
good. No fear! Everything had to earn

its keep with him. So The Gov’nor and
old Jack would have to leave, and go
into the bend behind the town, and
knock up some sort of a shack, and
never see the mustering at the yards or
hear the noises again. What a cow of
a way to finish up!
Hullo! He must be getting old. Here,
he’d walked right past the horses and
never saw ’em.
Disgusted with himself, The Gov’nor
turned back, caught Ball)fr mounted, and
rode back to the men’s hut at a mad,
bareback gallop, old Jack barking along
with him and acting like a silly pup.
Arnold, who knew sheep, hand-picked
about 150 young merino rams. They had
Wanganella and Boonoke blood, and
their mothers came from Murga. The old
Peppin strain could be detected in their
wide and intelligent foreheads, their great
liquid eyes, and the beautiful carriage
of them. Marked and sold as fat wethers,
they may have brought fifteen shillings
a head. As young flock rams, the best
of them might fetch two to eight guineas
each.
Arnold sent for a raip-classer and the
two men spent half a day in the yards.
By sunset, 100 of the flock had been
selected, their horns marked with red
and blue signs of quality, besides the
stud number and date burnt into them.
For upwards of six weeks the chosen
100 were tended as carefully as though
each were a racehorse.
On the morning of his last day at
Whymoul, The Gov’nor was up early.
He busied himself getting his gear to-
gether.
Old Jack, contrary to what might have
been expected, took little interest in his
master’s activities. He sat on the hut
verandah and stared off at the plains,
his muzzle working, a restlessness in his
eyes. Every now and then he whined a
little and trotted round the hut and back
to the verandah. There he would sit
again and stare out at the plain.
The old dog was expecting Someone
that day and, had The Gov’nor not been
so preoccupied with his own affairs, he
would, from his long experience of dogs,
have known it.
Arnold came down to the hut soon
after breakfast.
“I’ve got a job that’ll suit you, Thomp-
son,” he said, his eyes on the old man’s
packed belongings. “Those rams are
leaving on the train at three o’clock. I
want you to take them to the yards in
town. You needn’t come back. Young
Hull is going down with them, and he’ll
take your things in the truck and bring
your cheque. All the men are muster-
ing in the river paddock—the river’s
over the banks. But you and your old
dog should get the rams along easily
enough; it’s only about five miles or so.
I’ll come in with Hull and we’ll meet
you at the yards.”
“Ryebuck, Boss,” said The Gov’nor,
civilly.
The road to the town was fenced on
both sides except for the last half-mile.
Here, it entered on the town common,
a wide claypan which ran back to the
swamp beside the river. The road was
fenced on the left side along the com-
mon, but its right side was open.
All over the claypan, bluebush had
fastened dogged roots in the clay. For
years the winds had thrown sand and dust
against bushes which, grasping at this
new earth jealously, had built round
themselves little oases of sandy loam, on
which the barley-grass grew very sweet.
These oases, all shapes and sizes, were
dotted over the claypan as though some-
one had spilled them carelessly, allowing
them to fall in blobs and long fingers like
leaking treacle. When the river rose and
the swamp overflowed, the water stole
out over the claypan, all among these
little mounds, till the whole flat looked
like a lake of yellow and red water, with
many islands. In no place on the flat
was the water ever known to reach a
foot in depth. On its left, the high,
metalled road held back the passive flood.
Following the rams down a slope about
half a mile from the claypan, The
Gov’nor caught the gleam of water. He
looked away to the right and saw that
the swamp was full and pouring its over-
flow gently into the claypan. There must
have been a fresh in the already swollen
river.
He would have to keep the rams
close together and on the metalled road.
Once let them get into those muddy
shallows, once let them taste the luscious
young grass on those little islands, and
they would never reach the sales. Red
water would splash and stain their
fleecy coats, red clay would cling to
legs and faces like plaster, the shining
young sheep would be fouled and be-
slimed. No auctioneer would look at
them.
The Gov’nor turned to the dog, an
order on his lips. But the dog was gone!
The Gov’nor looked round about
sharply and saw old Jack trotting across
a paddock towards a clump of pines that
stood on a little hill. He called and
whistled ; the dog looked round, paused,
and went on.
The old man stared after him. Realisa-
tion came like a flash. Instantly, he
understood old Jack’s peculiar acts of
the day, his whimpers, his doggy ab-
straction, his reluctance to work. The
old dog was going away to die!
At the knowledge, a feeling of deser-
tion and loneliness swept over The
Gov’nor that made him bow his white
head on the saddle. Utter desolation
possessed him. He felt lost and alone
in a world full of strangers.
The bridle-reins fell from his hand. He
stumbled blindly to the roadside and sat
down, shaking in every limb. Tears rolled
down his leathery cheeks.
The rams, snuffing the water, increased
their pace. The horse cropped the grass.
If he thought of the rams at all in that
moment of desolation, The Gov’nor felt
they could roll in the mud for all it
mattered.
Trotting to the foot of the pines, old
Jack turned and looked back, sitting on
his haunches. He cocked his ears and
held his head first on one side and then
on the other. Something was wrong back
there. The sheep were spreading out
along the road ; they were separating
from one into a number of little flocks.
Here and there one backed away from
another, and the two came together
head-on with a sounding thump.
The horse had stopped, the figure of
his master crouched near it. Something
was wrong!
The dog whined and looked back
among the pines. Death wanted him in
there. Every canine instinct urged him
to go in among the trees and lie down
and meet his end like a true dog. He
looked back at the unattended rams and
a growl started in his throat.
All his years of training urged him
back to the road, back to the head of the
leaders, to bark and scold and hold them
till the stragglers caught up. A full
minute passed while Death and Duty
struggled for him. Duty won.
Jack gave one excited yelp and went
racing at an angle across the paddock
towards the leaders. His old sharp bark-
ing cut in on his master’s misery.
The Gov’nor lifted his head, startled.
He looked down the road. The leaders
were stopped right where the road
entered on the claypan —stopped before
a dancing, barking, black and tan image
that flickered back and forth with all
the vim and business-like importance of
a young dog.
The Gov’nor glanced towards the pines
and back down the road. He shook his
head in bewilderment, and mounted his
horse. Between them, he and the old
dog got the rams to the yards without
a splash.
Arnold and young Hull drove up in
the utility just as The Gov’nor closed the
gate. Little was said. Two cattle trucks,
their floors covered with fresh hay and
their sides covered with tarpaulins, were
waiting, and the three men loaded the
.rams at once, 50 to the truck.
Old Jack took no part in the loading.
It was his daughter, Hull’s red bitch,
which pushed them up the race. When
it was done, the three went back to the
truck and found old Jack lying beside
it. Death had followed him from the
pines.
The Gov’nor became voluble. He
knew that something rather remarkable
had happened, and the lesson of Duty
before Self, as preached by the old dog,
was not missed by him. Ignoring Arnold,
he told young Hull about it. The young-
ster eyed the dead dog in amazement.
But Arnold heard. As he looked across
at the red water on the flat and thought
of the rams, the man in him rose up
and saluted the dead, while his eyes
rested warmly on the living.
It would have meant the sack if the
rams had been sullied. This old hand
must be a rare trainer of dogs.
“Thompson,” Arnold said, a slight
smile on his face. “Ride the old horse
back to the station ; I’ll bring your things
in the truck.”
“Bring him, too,” said The Gov’nor,
pointing to his dead.
Arnold nodded.
Knowledge.
O heart, be still! No more, no more I bnng
My lean, keen hounds for hunting ot tne
For though the sea upon the bleak smooth shore
Trails peacock-colored fans, and, as belore.
The moon breathes silver through the nignts
And wind shapes music from the headlong air,
Though light still makes a glory of dull stone,
Yet all the roses into earth have gone.
Having laid hands upon an ancient truth,
I must put by the dagger of my youtn.
O heart, be still! No more, no more I bring
My horn and hounds to hunting of the bpring.
