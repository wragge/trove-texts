Builders and Stealers
The extent to which the human mind is
able to strike an entirely new idea must
remain a question for some greater future
to debate. Ethnologists, philologists and
archaeologists seem to allow very little room
for original conception. They will hardly
admit the sudden creation of a word, a racial
custom or even of an art design. One of
them argues that the dragon of China is
proof of a race-memory of the great saurians,
not even allowing the possibility that an
early Chinaman might have drawn a carica-
ture of a lizard or snake in such a fashion as
to win the admiration of his tribe. But
evidence of a similar lack of creative origi-
nality is strong enough. Take the commonest
of the Greek key-patterns. That design can
actually be found in Chinese art; but i
presence there is to be directly tracec
to an early trade with Samarkand.
The ethnologist is always looking fo
a race behind the race, the philolo
gist for a word behind the word; and th
archaeologist is very unwilling to believe i
any new thing under the sun. Coins struc
in Britain a hundred years before the Chri
tian era are crude but direct imitations o :
those of Philip of Maeedon; the temples o:l
Greece are shown —not very convincingly
to be amplifications of the original model o :
a liut of slabs and logs; the fundamenta
teaching of the New Testament is that o
Orpheus, the mythical Greek poet; the ver
trousers of Gaul and Persia —on the suppos -
tion that no two people in 50,000 yeai
could both strike the idea of keeping thei
legs warm—are traced to a common source
This belief in the non-originality of th
human mind is probably pushed into th
realm of the ridiculous; but in a general wa.
it is based on much truth. Let any artis;
attempt to draw a living creature which ha
no point of resemblance to any creature seen
or known; let any poet attempt to describe
one emotion which has no relation to any
other emotion, known or felt. The mere sug
gestion of such things shows the limit oi:
mind. We can dream of stars beyond th
stars and suns beyond the suns, but we can
not dream of any new thing in the grea:
void which is not in the nature of an alterec
sun or an improved or distorted star. Even
if we dream of living creatures inhabiting
the ultimate ether, they are still more or les
in the form of human creatures or animals
So we are forced to confess that we are imi
tative and that our height of creation is onlj
a hair-breadth of variation from the though;
that already existed through the building up
of an infinite number of earlier hair-breadths
of variation.
But that hair-breadth is of tremendous
importance in the human scheme of things
The man who establishes a sporting recon:
by jumping an inch higher than any other
man has jumped is separated from his fel-
low athletes by a great deal more than an
inch. He is separated by the whole thought
of the jumping ages, because he has achieved
the hitherto impossible. His record will
stand, a definite and memorable thing, until
someone else jumps higher. In the world of
literary expression something of the same
kind is true. In lyric verse thorn is some-
times only a shade of difference between
sheer bathos and; the deepest call to the heart
and mind; only,a fractional deviation from
the commonplace may mark the height
of a great and striking originality. The
greatest flights of imagination are close to
tne exaggerations of a child’s nursery tale;
but in the difference lies the thing most to
be admired in human effort.
All along the line and in every depart-
ment of life there has been the constant
building upon the work of others. Each man
cheerfully takes the thought of another as a
foundation on which to build; but in the
realms of practical science and mechaifics
some little protection is given to the dis-
coverer and inventor. Patent rights secure
to these a period in which they may gather
personal advantage from the thing they have
added to the world’s store of knowledge. In
literature it is otherwise. Copyright may
protect a book for a generation and guaran-
tee a money return from it to the author;
but nothing can prevent the stealing of his
thought. That has become public property
from the moment it appears in print. It may
be argued, of course, that this is good for
the world even if it is at times a little un-
fair to the literary worker; but there are
eases of increasing frequency in which it is
good for neither public nor author. The
verse writers of Australia are followed by
a host of steady imitators—people who will
never be more than imitators, but who divide
the narrow market with the original workers
and in most cases sell their wares at the
same rate. What is worse, these imitators
put their work on record in little books and
booklets long before the collected volumes of
fchose whose thoughts they steal have found
their way to the press; and thus the whole
credit of the original creation is lost to the
person who created it.
To give an idea of the exact position, let
us suppose that Smith, dreaming in the twi-
light by the waterside, sees a magenta even-
ing. People have seen the evening in all
sorts of shades, but none of them ever really
felt it to be magenta before. The magenta
forces itselr upon Smith in such a way that
a whole series of magenta thoughts surround
his imagination. He thrills to magenta, is
inspired in magenta, and goes home and
writes the poem of his life. It is full of real
thought and emotion, rising far beyond the
bounds of a mere color-shade, yet wholly de-
pendent upon that color-shade for such 'finer
magic as it nossesses. It is printed next
week and read by a section of the public, in-
cluding very few verse-lovers with a long
literary memory and nearly all the verse-
imitators with a keenly-developed power of
absorption. Within six months magenta sun-
sets are reeking through the columns of the
press; within twelve mouths there are half-
a-dozen little books all filled with the
magenta haze, and with most of Smith’s
other thoughts as well. It is true that these
wtiters did not thrill to the magenta color-
ing as Smith did. Their verses are poor
nvul thin; but to a not very discriminating
public there is not mach difference. A year
kitur Stnifih publishes a volume ef verse,' in-
eluding bis ill-used poem. What is the result?
Tompkins, who really likes verse, reads the
poem to Mrs. Tompkins with the remark
“Now that would have been a line thing but
for that hackneyed magenta coloring. Surely
a man like Smith needn’t pretend to see
things as all these young ladies pretend to
see them.” That is very hard on Smith ; and
it is by no means certain that the future
will put matters right for him. Unfor-
tunately the case is not singular, and I have
no effective remedy to suggest; but Austra-
lia is losing by it. Writers complain that
their best thoughts and phrases are stolen
and sold by others before they have been a
month in print. It is certainly hard that
a writer should be thought an imitator of
the imitators of himself; and far beyond
Australia there may be voices that praise
the stealer, knowing nothing at all of the
person robbed.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Le style, c’est l’homme
The .quantity of woolly indefiniteness to be
found where one would last look for it, in
treatises and monographs on literary style,
is quite incredible; and it is but one of the
goodly; company in which mental infirmity
embodies itself in these works. Up and
down in tlieir pages the paralogism chases
the non scquitur as a dog ensueth his tail;
platitude . and truism shamble along, slip-
shod, it is true, but otherwise naked and
unashamed; and inaccuracy flourishes like
stinkwort in a South Australian paddock in
the Spring. I hare lately been following
the adventures of a single phrase among these
masterpieces. My confidence in scholars
and critics, which was robust, has survived,
but it has been badly damaged. The phrase
I followed—Buffon’s ''Le style est Vhommc
memo” (The style is the man himself) —has
been called by a high authority the best thing
ever said on the subject of style. Certainly
the high authority did not understand it
himself, and states Buffon’s meaning
wrongly; but these, as you shall see, are
venial and minor offences.
Sooner or later all the modern writers on
the art of prose quote, either expressly or by
implication, Buffon’s famous dictum. Mr.
Saintsbury (easily the greatest name jn re-
cent English critical scholarship) cites it as
“Le style, o’est Vhomme ” in his “History of
French Literature.” “Chambers’s Encyclo-
paedia” approves of and adopts the saying
that “Button completely exemplified his own
phrase, 'Le style, o’est Vhomme ’ ”; and evei
the Nortlicliffe millions were unavailing tf
save the Harmsworth encyclopedia, pub-
lished a year or two ago, from tumbling into
a similar ditch. Misquotation, you are
thinking, does not matter much if the sense
is. given rightly. But it happens that this
misquotation alters the whole meaning. The
sense is hardly ever given correctly in Eng-
lish, and rarely enough even in French. The
stylistic authorities being in this bad case,
blessed are they who do not expect too much
from journalists and reviewers; but one mod-
ern instance comes pat, and clamors for in-
clusion here. The most cocksure of critical
organs, the London Saturday Review, in a
recent notice of Middleton Murry’s “Pro-
blem of Style,” unbosoms itself of this: “The
lecturer repeated the more famous definitions
of style, the best of which is, no doubt, Buf-
fon’s ‘Lc style, e’est Vhomme me me.’ Button
perceived and was the first to point out
clearly that personal idiosyncrasy is the pri-
mary element which distinguishes one author
from another.” The point made here may or
may not be true in itself, but it was not
Buffon’s point. Even if it had been, Buffon
was not tue first, by many men and by at
least 1900 years, to perceive and to
make it. Mr. Saintsbury is against me here
again; but, quite certainly, he is wrong. One
of. the old Roman rhetoricians —Seneca, 1
think —boiled the whole thing down to an
epigram : “ Imago animi sermo est” (Speech is
the image of the mind). This is the Satur-
day reviewer’s Buffon in a nutshell. Coming
to English authors, and passing by the way
several other great Elizabethans—«as Roger
Ascham, Gabriel Harvey, George Puttenham
—my case may be proved to the hilt from
Ben Jonson’s fine analysis of style in the
“Discoveries.” Taking the Latin tag “Oratio
imago animi” as his text (Ben was a shock-
ing plagiary), he expatiates thus: “Lan-
guage most shows a man ; speak that I may
see thee. It springs out of the most retired
and inmost parts of us, and is the Image of
the Parent of it, the mind. No glass renders
a man’s form or likeness so true as his
speech.” Notice especially the last sentence.
In order fully to appreciate the pick, yet
to come, of our basket of mis-statements, it
is necessary to have in mind what Buffon
actually said, and where he said it. He had
been elected, to the French Academy, and, in
1758, he delivered before it the address which
has become famous the world over as the
“ Discours sur le stylo.” The dictum we are
here concerned with did not appear in the
original manuscript of the address, but was
added as an afterthought; possibly during
delivery—he may have spoken it. The point
Buffon was making was that subject-matter
counted for nothing in the chances of sur-
vival of a literary work; form was every-
thing. Do not trouble about the beauty or
the. sublimity of your ideas: “only well-
written books pass to posterity.” Knowledge,
facts, discoveries, pass to other writers, and
they gain when used by more skilful hands.
These things.are outside the man; the style
is the man himself— Lcs choscs sont hors de
Vhomme; le style est Vhomme meme. The
matter, that is, belongs to anybody, every-
body : the form belongs to the man himself
and by its quality, good or bad, lie shall en-
dure or perish. Excellence of form in style
is what Buffon was pleading for and extol-
ling, and there is in him no suggestion that
style expresses individual idiosyncrasy;
rather, indeed, the opposite, as M. Ferdinand
Brunetiere has pointed out. It is easy to
see that the whole trouble has been caused
by the. breaking off and casting away of the
;fir.st part-of Buffon’s sentence, which sup-
plies the key to bis meaning.
But the finest flower of misinterpretation,
my loveliest and last, I have culled from

DAVID JONES’, SYDNEY.
the eleventh edition of the “Encyclopaedia
Britannica.” The writer of the article on
“Style” therein has achieved a triumph. He
quotes Buffon’s phrase correctly; and, after
deliciously lamenting the fact that it is so
often misquoted and miscomprehended, he
goes on:
It should be remembered that Buffon was a zoo-
logist and that the phrase occurred in the course
of his great “Natural History.” He was considering
man in the abstract and differentiating him from the
other genera of the animal kingdom. Hence, no
doubt, he remarked that style was man himseli,
not, as every reviewer repeats the sentence to-day.
the man. He meant that "style in the variety and
elaboration of it distinguished the language of man
(homo sapiens ) from the monotonous roar of the
lion or the limited gamut of the bird. Buffon was
engaged with biological, not with aesthetic, ideas.
This is all pure moonshine. How such a
crescendo of absurdities (mixed metaphor
is demanded by the occasion), culminating
in the monotonous roar of the lion, got to the
printed page through the legion of collabora-
tors, editors, sub-editors and printers’ devils
without waking anybody up, is not to be
understood. If the writer, a most able man,
specially well versed ip French literature,
had turned back to the article “Buffon” he
would have been reminded of the u Discours
sur le style,” and would probably have omitted
the weird zoological noises that now affright
the wayfarer. I have been unable to dis-
cover that anyone else has noted this pas-
sage in the “Britannica,” and I demand that
justice be done to it, that it be put in its.
rightful place as the classic, the unapproach-
able, the unique example of literary lapse.
HENRY MOLONY.
The Sex War
The Dominant Sex, by Mathilde and
Mathias Vaerting (Allen and Unwin), is
one of those profound German works which
get nowhere in particular after all history
has been ransacked for proofs of their theses.
The proposition put forward is that “what we
call ‘masculine’ qualities to-day are merely
the qualities of a dominant sex; and
what we call ‘feminine’ qualities are merely
the qualities of a subordinate sex.” To estab-
lish their theory the authors cite a number
of allegedly significant phenomena observable
in what they call “Women’s States.” In old
Egypt women were the wooers.
Typical and psychologically significant is the fact
that, when women are the wooers, men behave in
the way that is regarded as proper for women to-
day when men are wooers. Think of the wooing of
Joseph by Potiphar’s wife. Joseph indignantly le-
puaiates the attempt to seduce him. As a last resort
he runs away in order to preserve his chastity.
Prostitution exists to-day because _ man .is
everywhere dominant: it will vanish with
the dominance of man.
Both in the case of the ancient Egyptians and in
that of the Spartans, the absence of female prosti-
tution has been noted in contrast to what obtained
in contemporary Men’s States. In Egypt there were
no female prostitutes. As regards Sparta, Plato
says there were no prostitutes there because women
could not make a living at the trade.
The writers might have gone on to remark
that women “could not make a living at the
trade” in the society of Rome in .Pliny’s
day, in certain fashionable circles in pre-
war Berlin, and in parts of Cairo when the
white armies were withdrawn; but it would
have spoiled part of their argument. Where
female prostitution vanishes its place is
often taken by a more abominable traffic,
and this traffic has always characterised
virile and militaristic races as markedly as
it has degenerate ones.
The dominant sex, we are told, may be
identified by the simplicity of its clothing—
regardless of the fact that in fighting coun-
tries, such as Germany and the Balkans, the
uniformed male is as gay and ornate as his
wife is drab.
In ancient Egypt the love of adornment was a
masculine, not a feminine, trait. Erman writes:
“Whereas to us it seems appropriate that women,
not men, should be fond of self-adornment, the
ancient Egyptians would appear to have been of the
opposite way of thinking. The fashions in men’s
clothing were greatly diversified, but women’s . dress
remained strangely uniform throughout the ages”....
We have already noted that in Libya- the dominance
of women was absolute. Strabo relates that the
men of this land were addicted to self-adornment, and
that | they delighted in the care of their bodies.
And so the authors go on delving learnedly
info side-issues and non sequiturs, but. say-
ing not one word about the economic issue,
which is the only one that has a practical
bearing on the matter. The last story Kath-
erine Mansfield wrote dealt in bitter-sweet
phrases with woman’s dominance by man.
A delicate “wife has been brought on to the
deck of a liner by her robust husband.
He knew, of course, that she ought to be down
in the cabin ; he knew that it was no afternoon for
her to be sitting on deck, in this cold and raw mist,
leeside or no leeside, rugs or no rugs, and he real-
ised how she must be hating it. But he had come
to believe that it really was easier for her to make
these sacrifices than it was for him.
And now the woman is thinking:—
Certainly the steward —good little chap—had done
ali in his power to make them comfortable. He had
put up their chairs in whatever warmth there was
and out of the smell. She did hope he would be
tipped adequately. It was on occasions like these
(and her life seemed to be full of such occasions)
that she wished it was the woman who controlled
the purse.
It is preposterous to suggest that women
are only, or chiefly, the wooers in Women’s
States. On the contrary it is the principal
occupation of most of them in every Men’s
State. The chase varies from the almost
frenzied pursuit of the marriageable million-
aire to the more reticent measures taken
against the smaller financial fry. The balls,
theatre-parties and dinner-parties of the rich,
like the picnics and “socials” of the poor,
are palpable traps into which the solvent
male walks at his peril: a few bilkers take
everything their would-be captors are pre-
pared to supply, without any intention of
making repayment; but the vast majority-
play fair, marry and are entertained no
more. There is no historical evidence that
the acquisition of power (which is “The
Dominant Sex’s” panacea against all femin-
ism’s troubles) has tended to make women
masculine. Compare the women of Wycher-
ley with those of any 20th-century dramatist,
and it will be found that the women of to-
day are considerably more feminine than
those of two centuries ago. Yet in the interval
woman has acquired the vote and the right
to sit in Parliament; property rights, which
put her on an equality wi'di man : the right to
practise medicine and law; and in most
parts of the Empire equality in regard to
divorce. Reigning queens have shown no
particular taste for masculinity. The authors
of “The Dominant Sex” point to the fact
that some of them have chosen their con-
sorts, but, as above mentioned, many women
who are not queens do the same. A queen
has an advantage over a washerwoman,
matrimonially speaking, inasmuch as she. can
marry almost any man she likes; but it is
one of the penalties of her position that her
advances must be more direct. While an
Elizabeth or a Victoria remains as essen-
tially feminine as a woman without power,
she nevertheless soon becomes as self-willed
as any man. In other words, she reacts
to the control of the purse. And it is in this
direction that woman’s emancipation must
be sought. It is generally agreed that few
women would become prostitutes if they
could earn money in another way. Mothers
would be less anxious to see their daughters
become prostitute-wives if they knew the
girls were capable of supporting themselves
in luxury. But are women mentally and
physiologically capable in the mass of success-
fully competing with men at the great re-
munerative callings—commerce, finance, sur-
gery, advocacy, engineering and high politics?
In proportion as they succeed in beating
man at his own game they will deprive him
of the power which some of them are scan-
dalised that he should possess. But even
so history offers no evidence of any value
that woman will become less feminine. With
a few rule-proving exceptions, she has been
feminine ever since the retirement from
Eden. It appears to be her metier.

For Children
Australian youngsters are well catered for in
the matter of rhyme-books made in their own
land. Every year a few appear ; but not very
often do the authors and illustrators get up
to the level of a child’s mind. For a child’s
thought moves on a high plane; and in the
attempt to write down rather than up the
authors miss their aim. Harrison Owen, in
Tommyrot Rhymes (Alexander McCubbin),
is a good deal more successful than most. He
writes for the small boy, and there is a
pleasant ripple of humor in his verses. Thus
when Dick decides that the island is no place
for him because the tigress has carried off
his two brothers :
Dick went off home that morning in
The butcher boy’s canoe;
And when the news he told his ma,
She said “This will annoy your pa!
Whatever shall I do?”
But Tom and Harry turned up again because
when the police arrested the animal they
found that
The tigress was a gentle beast
Who loathed to be alone;
She was extremely dull and sad,
And stole the boys because she had
No children of her own. •
Nancy in the Bush , by Alex. C. Welsh,
with illustrations by Minnie I. Rowe (Syd-
ney J. Endacott), is a more elaborate publi-
cation, with a short introduction bv John
Smith, of the Melbourne. Teachers’ College.
In tnat preface Mr. Smith says that “Mr.
Welsh does not expect to soar to the heights
reached by Stevenson, Blake or Field” ; and
he certainly doesn’t reach them. The chief
fault of his rhymes is that they so often miss
the child way of saying things and repeat
ideas that have become the hackneyed com-
monplaces of the trade. It is hard to
imagine a child saying
Or pause to watch the homeward bee,
Or magpie warbling merrily.
Nor is it very easy to imagine either a child
or its parents getting much out of verses
like those “To a Buttercup”:
Little flower, like priest of old,
Patens of the purest gold
In thy hands dost thou uphold.
Lo! the bread in mercy broken
We partake in mystic token;
Learn the truth by sage unspoken.
Here the hallowed vintage poured
By the hand of Heaven’s Lord
Thy gold chalice doth afford.
Thus I hold communion, flower
Of light divine; am from this hour
One with nature by thy power.
Mr. Welsh does not get much of either, the
mirth or wisdom of the child. Here is a
sample which is perhaps a little above the
average of the book:
Why is the sky so very blue?
Dear Gonda, tell the reason, do!
Is it because there blue-bells grow,
Or there do angels’ blue eyes glow?
Or are good children there galore,
Each in a gingham pinafore?
I think it must be like the ocean,
Blue, ever changing, full of motion,
Through which good girl? may float to Heaven,
If they go to bed at half-past seven.
In neither of the little books under con-
sideration is there much to boast of in the
way of craftsmanship. Mr. Owen is much
the better artist, but he is content to leave
very rugged lines like
Still their dad
Was rich and stacks of money had.
This is a pity, because good workmanship
makes reading easy ; and a child’s rhyme can
hardly be easy unless the lines follow the
usual sequence of speech. Neither author
quite simple enough in his method, but boys
will laugh with Mr. Owen; and where there
is laughter there is quality. Some of the
decorations in “Nancy in the Bush” are very
pleasing, and both books are excellently
printed.
W.
Australian Art
As “C.R.8.” sees it:—
Much as I admire the identity behind the initials
“P.L.,” I cannot help wondering whether he is not
harboring the prejudice of which he accuses Max
Meldrum’s opponents (R.P. 28/6/’’23). Surely Mel-
drum can be allowed to stand on his own merjts
without this gusty reiteration of the dogma that he
is the true God and his disciples are his prophets !
It, seems to me that “P.L.” has become so indoctrin-
ated with the new (old) faith that he is in danger
of losing his sense of critical values. Personally I
have the strongest regard for Meldrum and his art,
but I cannot allow this to bemuse my faculties to
the extent of recognising no points in the Other Fel-
low. The struggle of what is arrogantly labelled
the" Truth on one side, and is just as arrogantly
dismissed as Delusion on the other, is analogous to
the bitter literary and artistic feuds that have fright-
ened talented Frenchmen into bickering schools
and coteries for years.
I admit at once that “P.L.’s” statement of the Mel-
drum case seems logical and reasonable enough;
but am I to believe that Meldrum has the clue
to the only form of art that endures ? I doubt
it. Our conceptions of Truth and Beauty are con-
stantly changing in definition, and who knows that
a hundred years hence Meldrum may be bracketed
down with Winterhalter or Folingsby, whilst some
Cubist or Quadrilateralist may be informing his
contemporaries that the ancient notion of the import-
ance of tone, proportion and color in painting was
one of the stupefying hallucinations of an abandoned
and ignorant age. Briefly my position boils down to
a constitutional objection to the narrowing effects
of intellectual cliqueism. I object to the stand
that because I may believe Meldrum is a rational
and satisfying painter I must superiorly dismiss
Lambert as a mere draughtsman, and shudder dread-
fully before the landscapes of Griiner and Heysen.
You might as well ask me to dismiss Dunsany be-
cause he doesn’t write like Ibsen—it was left to an
American critic to achieve this very feat —or damn
Debussy because he hasn’t the power of Beethoven.
No, I may be booi'ish and ill-informed, but I am
incapable of this performance.
All conscious artists are worth any person’s culti-
vated attention, and personally I don’t care a dump
what methods are employed so long as the artist
has something to say. Meldrum may be right; but
what is right, and what wrong? The efforts of
the human brain, subject to God-knows-what con-
genital and emotional influences, have been respon-
sible for numberless religions, ranging from Shin-
toism to fire-worship, and every solid adherent of
these faiths believes his own particular way to
Paradise is made impregnable to all the other here-
tics by the tenacity of his own conviction.
A Satchel of Books
The Master of the Russian Ballet, by Olga Racster
(Hutchinson). A very interesting account of the
life of Enrico Ceceheti, an Italian ballet-dancer who,
alter a long career in his own country, was engaged
as maitre-de-ballet in Petrograd and Warsaw, and
was responsible for the education of such popular
artists as Pavlova and Nijinsky. Pavlova was the
most wonderful of his pupils. She contributes a
glowing Foreword in appreciation of her old master,
who, at her request, devoted three years to her, cor-
recting faults that threatened to ruin her technique.
The fee he received was equal to the amount lost
through abandoning a prosperous school in Petrograd.
He has now settled in London, and it is his ambition
to start a purely English ballet.
Wisdom’s Daughter, by H. Rider Haggard (Hutch-
inson). Oscar Wilde said of Rider Haggard that
“when he does tell us anything marvellous he feels
bound to invent a personal reminiscence, and to put
it into a footnote as a kind of cowardly corrobora-
tion.” Haggard here performs the same old trick in
a bogus introduction alleging that the yarn came to
him in the shape of an ancient manuscript from the
late Horace Holly, who will be remembered in the
original tale of “She” as a companion of the rein-
carnate Kall'ikrates, Leo Vineev. It purports to be
a few chapters from Avesha’s biography, and carries
the reader through numerous adventures in Arabia
and Egypt. It is fairly thrilling, but the author’s
efforts to impart a mythological atmosphere gives it
the stately character, without the grandeur, of Holy
Writ.
President Obregon, by Dr. E. J. Dillon (Hutchin-
son). Dillon, who is entitled to considerable respect
as an international publicist, regards Obregon as
the greatest man the world has produced during the
last 20 years. Born in 1880, one of a family of 18,
he rose to the Presidency of Mexico solely by his
force of character and military achievements. Un-
educated in military matters, he improvised an army
that performed marvellous feats in the extinction of
the brigand enterprises which masqueraded as rebel-
lions in the State. One of his opponents was the cele-
brated Villa, who, after an infamous record, has
settled down as a model citizen on a farm in north-
ern Mexico. Another disturber was Zapata, whose
staff was composed of over 400, including numerous
fillcs de joie, graded from colonels down to lieu-
tenants and drawing military pay for their services.
But Obregon’s chief trouble was the ancient ex-
squire Carranza, under whom he served until the
old man’s vagaries brought his downfall and prema-
ture death. Dillon tries to mitigate his worship by
references to Obregon’s stiff treatment of the Church ,
but on the whole he is well satisfied with the moral
appointments of his hero. He has much to say about
U.S. intrigue for the exploitation of the country, and
draws attention to President Wilson’s warlike atti-
tude to Mexico for minor discourtesies in the days
when German insults were being answered only with
a shower of Notes.
The Commandment of Moses, by Stephen McKenna
(Hutchinson). Barely stated, the problem is
whether a girl who has lived for a year with a
soluier who has been killed at the Front should tell
her right-thinking fiance about the episode. She
thinks she should, and in an artificial last scene
she hands him the information on paper; but he
melodramatically burns it, and the presumption is
that she is to keep her naughty secret. The heroine,
Joan Prendergast, is one of those picturesque
McKenna types who emerge from intense flapperhood
apparently ennobled by any sort of amour that come
their way. For contrast, her rather priggish young
man, Jack Keithley, has a profound worship for the
Decalogue, the Throne and the Constitution, a nd it
is inconceivable that Joan would be attracted by
that kind of fellow.
Enrico Caruso, by Pierre V. R. Key in collabora-
tion with Bruno Zirato (Hurst and Blackett). Zirato
was Caruso’s last secretary, and probably through
his co-operation the biography is rather overcrowded
with dates, places and names. Yet sufficient of the
personal side of the artist is discussed to show that
he was an extraordinarily gifted man. Apparently he
had some early training of a sort, but never an
adequate grounding in music, and as he was notori-
ously indolent he never mastered any instrument but
his own great organ. All his life he could only
painfully knock out a simple tune on the piano. Yet
at the height of his fame he was never wrong in
singing with an orchestra. His phrasing was magni-
ficent, his breathing superb, and people who had
been taught by Tamagno and De Reszke to associate
fine singing with tumultuous bust-action marvelled at
the effortless production of the Caruso tenor. Thomas
Burke, of “Limehouse Nights,” contributes to the
volume an appreciation of the Italian singing with
Melba in “La Boheme” at Covent Garden, and
Burke declares that the voice was a “miracle” that
left one exhausted of the power of wonder. A few
years before his London debut—he had been heard
almost everywhere else before Covent Garden engaged
him Caruso’s voice was in the, habit of breaking
on the high B flat of the Flower Song in “Carmen,”
and this and other defects warranted small hope of
his ever becoming a world-wide celebrity. He was
then crude in acting and deportment, and his in-
ability to read easily from the score without his
own curious notations, of which examples are given,
seemed to mar his advancement. But natural
genius triumphed, and he who was singing in 1899
for mere bread and butter in Italy commanded 1300
dollars a performance six years later. His fee leapt
to 2500 dollars in 1920, and with the receipts from
gramophone records he collected anything from
180,000 to 200,000 dollars a year. Though he spent
prodigally and helped an army of relations and
down-and-outs, he died furiously rich. He left be-
hind him two fine boys who were the upshot of a
profound affection for a prima donna who after-
wards deserted him, and there is also a little baby
Caruso called Gloria, the offspring of his marriage
to a pretty American, Dorothy Benjamin. A few
months before he died of a complication .of com-
plaints that necessitated seven operations, he scored
the greatest artistic success of his career as the
elderly Eleazar in Halevy’s “La Juive.” The cast
of that memorable performance included the Aus-
tralian Evelyn Scotney, who sang the rBle of the
Princess.

How often have you
noticed the “tout en-
semble of an otherwise
artistically furnished home
ruined by defective light-
ing.
The colorings of tapestries,
carpets and furnishings
may be in perfect harmony
but the lighting posi-
tively repels—it jars.
Modern lighting improve-
ments will provide atmo-
sphere tone, and color to
harmonise with any sur-
roundings.
Artistic lighting is planned
so that color is felt rather
than seen; it should
pro-
vide atmosphere without
forcing itself upon one as a
color.
The correct application of
lighting will provide dis-
tinctive atmosphere at less
expense than any other
expenditure of furnishing.
Proper lighting spreads
the mystic spell when G.E.
lamps are used.
The exquisite design of
G.E. fittings adds charm,
grace and beauty to in-
terior decorations. They
are elegant in color and
contour, enabling you to
attain harmonious lighting

Laughter.
In the night I found one lying
(And at first I thought him dead)
On the grass and softly crying,
All the flowers about him sleeping
And a frightened moonbeam creeping
From the sunshine of his head.
“Tell me who you are,” I said.
“Such a lonely vigil keeping?”
Still I see him smiling, sighing,
Hear his strange young voice replying:
“I am Laughter—weeping.”

Growing Young.
If a man grow grey kindly
With the laugh of the world’s due,
Shall he look at last blindly,
Seeing black in the morning’s blue?
The old men have mocked us and ruled us—
And some are born old—
And the grey words have hedged us and
fooled us
Away from the green and gold.
But I think it is only dayspring—
Stars fading out into light
Ere the sun of the yellow way spring
Burnished and clean for the flight—
And my heart leaping out of the night
Cries" bravely long mirth and great scorning
For the slow beat that held it too long—
It is life, O my soul, at the morning,
And the airs are a tumult of song !
White wings of the world beating strong
Bear me up, for my songs are unsung!
Grown grey, I shall never see blindly ;
For the years to the sun falling kindly
Are laughing me young.

The Closed Room.
With tactless hand stern Fate has led
My feet into this room again,
And memories I had thought long dead
Throng my reluctant heart and brain;
The moments pass on crippled feet,
And in grim pantomime they show
Love’s folly, and the indiscreet,
Impassion’d days of long ago!
And now the flimsy curtains sway,
As once beneath a hand I knew;
There comes a whispered word and gay—
The scented dark speaks all of you!
Of what avail? I do not blame.
Kind years have healed the scars we bore ;
Tears have long blotted out your name.
So I steal out, and close the door.

Glimpse.
Just as the tunnel, swiftly left behind,
Recedes, and to the watchers in the train
There comes a sun-gold glimpse of smil-
ing plain,
Contented hills curved by the passing wind,
A land with Summer tremulous, and kind
In beauty, where the green, young leaves
again
Spring forth, sweet children of the earth
and rain,
And little fields with furrows brownly lined,
So, in the misty fortress of a cloud,
The moon upon the battlements for a space
Walks silver-shod, and sends a gleam to
charm
My heart. For momently I see your proud,
Iviss-courting mouth, the shadows of your
face,
And your dark head silk-pillowed on my
arm.

The Quest.
Fair, laughing boy, the magic world you know
Is a long, wondrous page to be unrolled ;
Morning; a rose with sweet, red heart aglow,
Whose perfumed subtleties are manifold!
The shimmering hours steal by on filmy
wings,
And on the grass you. fling yourself, to
dream
Of complex and unutterable things—
The Why and Wherefore a recurring theme.
The beauty of the moon’s mysterious face,
The gorgeous tapestry that Nature weaves,
Barbaric in its wealth of broidered grace,
With web of sunlight, and the silk of
leaves.
Loiter a little in the dim and cool
Mirage of deep and adolescent thought,
Bathing your feet within its quiet pool,
While Wisdom pens the script that you
have sought.
Oh, radiant mortal, set amid earth’s fret!
’Tis yours to scale the boulders on the
right,
That your exultant soul breathe no regret,
When to your Boyhood you must say good-
night.
The brazen echoes of the bell have rolled
Through Quadrangle and Colonnade, to
tense
Deep strivings with the deathless gods of old,
Pale deities that haunt the throne of Sense.
When History and Economics fail
* To blind you to the yearnings of your soul,
Lo, Beauty ’neath a soft, enchanting veil
Offers you jewels from her tinted bowl.
Ideals rise to peaks sublimely tall,
On trailing clouds of winnowing crimson
fires,
In quest of Truth. With mien imperial,
You marvel at the strength of your desires.
When from the halls of Learning you depart,
Whence matchless Eloquence from grave
lips fell.
One thing shall be engraven on your heart:
The love of friends to whom you bid tare-
•well.
nroves 9,11 prowess on the field of F9te.
Soon'with a golden key, a slender hand
May open wide for you a secret gate.
Oh, peerless Youth, and you will under-

THURSDAY, JULY 19, 1923.
PLAYING THE ENEMIES’ GAME.
A cable message stated the other day that
if Australian meat was to have any chance
at Smithfield shippers would “need to study
American and Argentine methods, which in
the past have been eminently successful com-
pared with the Australian methods.” The
regularity with which every variety of Aus-
tralian comestible manages to arrive in
foreign parts in a deteriorated condition pre-
sents a phenomenon which this country would
do well to study. The first thing the Aus-
tralian observes on returning from a trip
abroad is that his own country’s foodstuffs
(and particularly its meat, butter and fruit)
are the best at the price in the world. But
a point on which many competent observers ap-
pear to be also agreed is that by the time
Australian mutton, canned fruit, etc., reach
England they are among the worst of their
kind on offer. Part of the blame—a great
part—must undoubtedly be shouldered by
men in the business at. this end. Our work-
ers have not troubled to learn the finer
points of the meat-dressing art. with the result
that the Australian carcase looks relatively
unattractive as it emerges from the freez-
ing chamber overseas. Australian stock is
not topped on lucerne areas, as so much of
the abattoir-bound TJ.S. and Argentine stock
is; and our cattle mature too slowly. There
is a suicidal tendency all through the food-
exporting trade of Australia to skimp things,
to proceed on the basis that anything in
reason is good enough for John Bull. Of
course, it is not, if John Bull knows it,
and there are powerful interests at work in
London which are concerned to show Eng-
land that some of Australia’s primary pro-
ducts are even worse than they look.
It is a truism that no moral laws run
in world-commerce. Just as war is war, so
business is business. In 1912 Iyrupps armed
both Turkey and Turkey’s enemies, and pre-
vious to that the firm supplied Russia and
Belgium with field artillery. Armstrongs
(England) and Schneiders (France), like
Krupps, have impartially supplied foreign
countries with armaments regardless of the
likelihood of the weapons being used to
slaughter Englishmen or Frenchmen. In the
U.S.A., when a railway or banking or oil
company makes up its mind to exploit a
given area, it destroys any competitors it
may find locally as a matter of course.
America is now where The Bulletin pro-
phesied over 10 years ago it would eventually
be—in Smithfield market. It would have
been easier for the “Big Five,” who aim
eventually at the control of the whole of
the world’s foodstuffs, to collar the London
market through Australasia. The attempt
was made shortly before the World War, but
owing to the opposition of the Australian
and M.L. Governments it failed. It is now
of the first importance to the success of the
Meat Trust’s campaign that Australasian
competition should be knocked clean out.
The fly in the Trust’s ointment, to begin
with, was the possibility of an Australian
or M.L. meat shipment arriving in England
—a possibility which made it impossible for
the Trust to fix a price for British meat in
Chicago—and the same difficulty will continue
to confront the “Big Five” so long as Aus-
tralasia is still exporting to Britain. Under
the circumstances, by all the rules of world
commerce, certain moves are to be expected
from the American interests. It would be
remarkable if the propaganda experts of the
Trust did not draw attention in the right
places to the inferiority of the products of
the rival concern: it would be remarkable
if other Trust agents did not manoeuvre to
raise the price of Australian meat, etc., to
the British consumer (in this connection it
is worth remarking that meat which is de-
livered in London for 17d. per lb. costs the
retail buyer there as much as 22d. per lb.) :
and it would be still more remarkable if
Trust agents did not go in for wholesale
sabotage of Australian products, as oppor-
tunity offered on wharves and in freezing
chambers. These are recognised as legiti-
mate methods of warfare as Big Business
fights nowadays, and the Meat Trust is play-
ing a big game in London.
* * * $
This paper holds no brief for the Com-
monwealth Shipping Line, but to the extent
that it promises to guard Australian pro-
ducers against the machinations of overseas
combines it may have a national and Im-
perial value far in excess of its cost. It
has to be remembered that the Meat Trust
can be competed with in the U.S. as well
as in England. There are big openings for
Australia in America, in meat, fruit and
butter, between October and February. It
should not be difficult to establish retail shops
in the great American cities, and run them
at a profit, despite the boycott which would
certainly be aimed at them. Unfortunately,
no organisation would entirely obviate bribery
on American ships and wharves and on
the long transcontinental railway journeys,
the object being to have the consignments
damaged or ruined in transit. With a direct
service of Commonwealth liners to New York
via the Panama Canal the chances of inter-
ference by “grafters” in the pay of the Trusts
would be vastly reduced, and in the London
trade similar advantages should accrue. At
present meat-growers are becoming so de-
jected at the lugubrious stories that keep
pouring in from London about the low class
of their exports that they are talking of
abandoning the British market and turning
to those Asiatic countries which have begun
to consume meat in bulk. If this counsel
of despair is adopted, the game of the Meat
Trust in Britain will have been won. Nor
will Australia gain any more from its re-
creancy than a temporary hold on its new
markets.. As soon as Chicago is ready it
will absorb those preserves as well. Clearly
Australia’s business, both as a food-produc-
ing country and as a part of the Empire
which is vitally interested in the welfare of
the United Kingdom, is to fight hard in the
first place to keep a foot in Smithfield, and,
as a secondary consideration, to carry the meat,
fruit and butter war into American territory.
With that end in view the trade should en-
gage in propaganda, and it should take steps
to safeguard its wares en route to their mar-
kets. But, above all, it should ensure that
the articles it sends abroad are worth safe-
guarding and worth boosting. At present
it appears that about half the inimical work
of our trade competitors is being done for
them by Australians on Australian soil.
THE REALLY BIG MIDDLEMAN.
The “primary industries” of the Common-
wealth have assumed a leaning attitude these
days, and the really great “natural re-
sources,” save wool, have a tendency to hold
out the hat for aid. In fact, the alleged
props of industry mostly want to be propped
themselves. To begin with, the Queensland
sugar industry states that the situation is
precarious. The Commonwealth Government
took charge of it in 1915 to the extent of
buying the entire crop at £lB per ton: The
price was put up to £2l in 1917, and in 1920
the purchase agreement was renewed for an-
other three years at £3O 6s. Bd. per ton. Now
the Government offers to buy the crop for two
years more, but it is told that unless some-
thing is done beyond that period the sugar
industry will die out. With all this aid
the area under cane is 100,000 acres or less,
and the supply -doesn’t always equal tne
local demand. A subsidy on exported beef
has been provided for, Queensland being the
great beef country, and being in trouble
again. The Commonwealth has decided to
guarantee 3s. per bushel for wheat, a sub-
stance largely grown for export, lest some-
thing resembling a catastrophe should strike
that great natural resource also, there being
every prospect of a weak European market.
The guarantee isn’t calculated to make the
grower arrogant with wealth, or to promote
a violent rush into the trade, but it is as
much as any Government which means to
pay can afford. The cotton industry, which
also is meant for an export industry, is ex-
panding under a State guarantee of s|d. per
lb., or about three times the market value of
10 years ago. But the Theodore Govern-
ment is a hopeful creature, and trusts that
the present high rates have come to stay.
Now the export fruit trade has taken up
the parable that it can’t survive without aid
of some sort. , Harassed growers who have
developed this “great natural resource” be-
yond the capacity of the local market have
taken to publishing the results of consign-
ments by way of an object-lesson. One
typical instance was that of 100 cases of
apples which fetched what was said to be an
ordinary price, and yet brought the grower
under 2|d. per case. This was how: —
Cases and Packing. . .. . . .. £8 15 0
Freight and Cost of Getting on Board .. 23 0 4
Advertising, Exchange, Dock Dues, Port
Charges, Cartage, etc., all in London.. 7 2 2
Commission, in London . . . . . . 2 2 0
Left for Grower . . . . . . . . 19 6
Total . .. ..£4119 0
There is a widespread idea that “commish”
is the great enemy, and that if the Govern-
ment or somebody established a big Aus-
tralian selling agency in London many good
results would ensue. But so far as the fig-
ures go, there is only £2 2s. of visible “com-
mish” to economise upon. No information
is given re the cost of getting the fruit to the
Australian point of departure, but out of the
£4O 19s. 6d. of specified charges £32 4s. 6d.
(all, that is, save cases and packing) is
an essay on the. supreme folly of not con-
centrating the national energies on the exten-
sion of manufactures. This should be done
even If the breathless pace of the land-
settlement fuss, which costs and fusses so
much and settles so little, should slacken a
trifle. The need for more local apple-
consumers is urgent. It is a weird thing
that it should be every busy-borrowing-body’s
business to dot the land with farms for the
production of the orthodox things which are
a drug in the local market, and nobody’s
business to dot it with factories for the sup-
ply of things of which the shortage is in-
tense, so tnat it has to be supplied by a
ruinous policy of importation.
Australia supports too many middlemen.
The biggest middleman, who, incidentally,
gives rise to others, is the big ship which
takes away the raw materials that we should
use, and brings back the manufactured
articles that we should make. It not only
charges the disgruntled apple man £23 os. 4d.
for needless outward freight, which he knows
about, but it possibly charges him as much
for needless inward freight which, he pays
but doesn’t know about. The war has greatly
altered the po_sition of the plodder who tries
to make a white man’s wage by raising food,
and shipping it over almost the longest sea-
trail the globe can show, that he mav sell
it to impoverished folk in a competitive mar-
ket. A return to pre-war freights was taken
by many as almost a matter of course, and
the lack of any such return is regarded as
a shock and a grievance and also a mystery.
Yet there is an explanation: the shins are
mostly British, and the war has left Britain
with a tax-bill. If the imposts were aver-
aged (and thanks to the gentle art of “pass-
ing it on” they average themselves more
than appears) every man in the carrying
trade, from the chairman of directors to the
cook’s slushy, is paying nearly £l7 per
annum more in national and local taxes than
he did before the date of Kaiser William’s
famous madness. That is, £6» for himself,
a wife and two children. Add that the
people who build, repair, load and provision
the ships are in the same situation, and it
doesn’t appear that the hire of our most ex-
pensive middleman is likely to revert to
the old figure for many a day. In other
words; the net return from 100 cases of
exported apples may have got down to 19s.
6d. as a steady thing—and the grower has
much more to pay out of the 19s. 6d. than
aforetime. Hence the idea that Australia
should manufacture on very large and widely
diffused principles, and aim to cut out its
golden middleman both going and coming.
GETTING EVEN WITH UNCLE.
The Washington Government has announced
that no more than 279 Australian immi-
grants will be allowed into the U.S.A. be-
tween July 1, 1923, and June 30, 1924. Pro-
vision is made for both monthly and yearly
limits, and if. the number is exceeded in any
montli the excess (which may be a girl tra-
velling with her mother or an old woman
desirous of spending the rest of her days
with an only son) will be taken into cus-
tody and bundled back.at its own expense.
There is, of course, no corresponding restric-
tion on Americans migrating to Australia.
Neither does the Commonwealth Parliament
retaliate by saying (as it could and should)
that trade with the country which refuses
to open its gates to even six Australians per
week must be conducted on a fifty-fifty basis.
Wherefore we get these astonishing Aus-
tralian statistics:—

The position is really worse than the figures
suggest, and unless Parliament does some-
thing to redress the balance it will grow
worse still. For instance, our canned-fruit
industry is in a bad way owing to the Cali-
fornian article being dumped on the British
market at prices with which Australia can-
not compete. As a result of the two fruit
pools the Australian Government has a mil-
lion cases of canned fruit on hand. These
it is trying to get rid of in Australia at
“reduced” rates, viz., Bs. per dozen tins for
peaches, 10s. for apricots and 12s. 6d. for
pears—all f.o.b. But the Californians are
selling their canned peaches, landed in Eng-
land, at 7s. 3d. per dozen tins, their apricots
at 7s. 6d., and their pears at 12s. fld. Again,
of the £38,417,000 worth of goods sent to
America a million represented copra brought
to Sydney from the islands (the trade has
now disappeared) and another million was
for war wheat. - To prevent the resurrec-
tion of that trade Uncle has clapped
on a duty of .30 cents a . bushel.
Wool generally accounts for half the
value of our exports to America, and it
will be difficult for Samuel to do without.
Australian fleeces altogether. But he lias
apparently resolved to make the effort. At
his last tariff revision *the duty on Austra-
lian wool was lifted to 31 cents a pound
Similarly, Australian beef was made duti-
able at 3 cents a pound, mutton at 24 cents
butter at 8 cents, honey at 3 cents, raisins
and lemons at 2 cents, eggs at 8 cents a
dozen, and apples at 25 cents a bushel.
* A’ *
And while all this was going on the Aus-
tralian Government, as always, turned the
other cheek. Last year it allowed tin-
Y'ankee Jews who have collared the Austra-
lian moving-picture market to flood it with
20,076,000 feet of exposed film, and to de :
clare its value at a whole £257,742. Yet every
month or so a few thousand feet of piffle;
pornography or vulgarised history is im-
pudently advertised as “a million-dollar
film.” A frequent boast of the imported
movie person is that his “industry” is one
of the greatest in Australia. All that the
Customs Department got from this great
“industry” in 1921-22 was £115,752. In the
same year the tobacco people, who make no
pretence that theirs is a “great industry,”
paid duties amounting to £1,910,479. Had
the 20,670,000 feet of U.S. film been assessed
at something approaching its selling value
in Australia, the revenue would have bene-
fited substantially, and there would be even
a wider gulf between the import and export
returns. Also, the Australian producer of
pictures would have got a measure of pro-
tection which he at present lacks. There
has been no answer to the charge of a N. S.
Wales M.L.A. that of 1500 screen-plays ex-
hibited in Australia during the last two
years 1477 were American and only 12 Aus-
tralian. This monstrous disproportion would
not have been possible had the imported
stuff been valued for taxation purposes at
an approximation to its worth for hiring
purposes—which may be anything from
£5OOO to £lO,OOO in the case of a popular
picture—-and taxed in accordance with the
national policy of fostering the growth of
useful industries. Not at the swindling rate
of 14d. a foot.
* * * *
One way of beginning to get a bit of our
own back from the Americans would be to
restrict imports of U.S. films in any fiscal
year to the quantity produced in the Com-
monwealth. By that means a real industry
—not a sham and an imposition—would open
up for Australian writers, artists, photo-
graphers, actors, mechanics, stage-carpenters,
carbon-makers and so forth, and the public
appetite for the silent drama would no longer
be exclusively catered for by more or less
undesirable foreigners, some of whom are
Huns, others ruffians -with the minds and the
morals of monkeys, and others again ignorant
vulgarians. Also, there would be no thine
to stop the better-class U.S. companies mak-
ing pictures here, even as Cadbury and Pas-
call make lollies here.
WHOSO DESTROYETH BEAUTY.
Notus n’irons plus au hois,-
Les lauriers sont coupes.
Tbuly we Maorilanders are a remarkable
people.
Ours is an adorable country, and the islands
that compose it are set like jewels in the
sea—a sea that is silver under the moon and
golden in the flush of dawn, and blue and
purple and green in the light of the splendid
sun. In a hundred landlocked harbors, in
a thousand tiny bays, the water laps as
gently on the sand as the azure Mediter-
ranean on a still summer day fondles the
shores of Italy or Greece. But upon the
open beaches and against the headlands the
waves from ocean beat incessantly and
break themselves in foam and spray, till the
dullest imagination is stirred by the majesty
of movement and the crash and clash and
swelling harmonies of sound.
And the sky of Maoriland, constantly
changing, yet always beautiful! Sometimes
violent and vivid, orange and scarlet or
wickedest green away in the nor’-west under
an arch of grey ; or massed with white cloud
against the intensest blue; or tinted like
mother-o’-pearl with delicate shades of pink
and primrose. And between the sky and
the sea there are the everlasting hills —hills
that have form and individuality; rolling
hills ; serrated mountains, blue and shadowy
in the distance ; volcanic cones rising, won-
ders of the world, solitary from the plain.
Ours is an adorable country!
Once upon a time, when the primitive
Maori was in possession, many of those hills
were bush-covered to the sea" The mighty
kauri, the stately totara with its red-brown
foliage shot with gold, the graceful rimu—
these rode supreme, aristocrats of the forest.
The gullies were full of tree-ferns, and the
white convolvulus and starry clematis ran riot
over the humbler trees. In the darkness and
dampness underneath were found the rarest
and most filmy ferns—tin; Prince of Wales’s
feather, and the kidney-fern, grown with
such care, and shown with such pride, in
European hothouses to-day.
The white man came: he proceeded to cut
and burn, and lie has continued —the white
man who has so fixed, so pitiful, a belief in
his innate superiority to the brown man—
to cut and burn till" there is nothing left.
Near the city of Auckland, indeed, it is
still possible to see unspoilt bush in all its
many-toned beauty. May the God and
Father of Forests be propitious to her.
Akarana the charming! And may the sun
shine and the rain drop gently upon the
blue-green puriri, upon the spreading tree-
ferns, lovingly planted, lovingly tended, in
many of her fair gardens, along many of
her streets! But out in the back country
the hills of Maoriland are desolate to-day.
You may travel far and see nothing to
break the monotony of the grassland but
an occasional native tree as solitary as a
pelican in the wilderness, and probably dying
a lingering death for lack of companion-
ship. Elsewhere the ghosts of dead giants
in their myriads still hold out bleached
skeleton hands towards Heaven, and testify
against Man the Destroyer, as do the blasted
elms and mutilated poplars upon the battle-
fields of Belgium. Gone is the bush, our
priceless possession, the heritage of future'
generations. Gone even the bronzed, frag-,
rant manuka and the decorative flax. Ami
vanished with the bush are its lovely child
ren—the bell-birds,. whose music enchanted
the, ear of Gook ; the honey-loving tui; the
colored-parrakeete. >
t Truly we Maorilanders arc a remarkable
people !


But we who have rendered our country as
bare and bleak as we could —we are also
beginning to dim our marvellous sky with
the smoke of our cities, and no doubt we
shall soon find means of polluting our sea
—we have discovered that perhaps Mother
Nature, who planted the thick bush, knew
a thing or two, after all. Trees are neces
sary, if not for beauty, at least for timber,
for firewood and for shelter. But the great
totara and matai, which we succeeded in
getting rid of in a few months, or, maybe,
days, took centuries to grow. So we replace
them with the Australian gum; the European
poplar, the Californian pine, which come
quickly to maturity. Mother Nature did
not paint them, as she did the plants that
spring from our own soil, to harmonise with
our peculiar atmosphere, but that doesn’t
matter to us. And the nurseryman supplies
us with exotic shrubs to fill in empty spaces
that were once pink and white with manuka,
golden > with kowhai. And the “weeping-
willow” dangles not gracefully over the
water, but grown in horrible, shapeless
clumps it weeps wildly and aimlessly, blown
by an alien wind upon the dry, yellow hills.
We have destroyed the bush which should
be our very present delight, and we have de-
prived the children of the future of their
birthright. They will never swing in the
supple-jacks,- nor build houses amongst the
flax-blades, nor will the wind make music for
them through the raupo. They will not
dream dreams nor see visions in shadowy
green solitudes; nor will they' ever know
how beautiful were the glossy leaves of the
karaka, the bush-laurel.
Les lauriers sont coupes.
We have killed them all, the wonderful things
of the forest, to make way for our sheep and
the cattle upon our thousand hills. Next we
kill the young lambs and foolish sheep; and
when we have sufficiently battened upon theii
carcases—metaphorically as well as literally
—we leave our adorable country to seek
beauty overseas, remarkable people that we
are. 'We who extirpate the yellow kowhai
fall into ecstasies over the gold of the Eng-
lish laburnum. We whose land is yet lit-
tered with the corpses of the bush trees are
rapturous before the olive-groves of Italy
or the beechwoods that the British have not
hacked away. And if we go to Greece we
shall marvel perhaps at the sterility of the
hills whence the forests and the violets and
the asphodels have disappeared. “They came ,
they cut away my toll dark pines. ,, Pos-
sibly we shall even wax indignant when the
modern Greek chops down the newly-planted
tree for firewood, and condemn him —our
own brother—for his commercialism, his
horrid vandalism, his lack of public spirit.
But whosoever. Greek or Maorilander, de-
stroys the beauty of his country imperils his
own soul. And upon him, and upon his
children, even unto the third and fourth
generation, falls the curse, the abomination
of desolation. This is our punishment. Is
it not sufficient?

The Modesty of Australia’s Worst
Customer.
One good feature of the ten-weeks’ time-
limit on the proceedings of the Common-
wealth Parliament is that it greatly reduces
the possibility of a one-sided fiscal arrange-
ment with Canada being rushed through an
uncomprehending Legislature. With Bruce
due at the Imperial Conference in October,
and a crowded business-paper to be disposed
of in the meantime, the ambitions of the
Canadian Government and its Foreign-trade
sympathisers on this side are not likely to
be gratified during the present session. But
the oracle might easily be worked were Par-
liament to remain sitting till November or
December, when it invariably becomes accom-
modating, not to say soporific. In the com-
mercial pastime of offering little and ask-
ing much the Canadians have beaten the
Dutch out of the field. Of all the countries
trading with Australia, their purchases are
the smallest in proportion to their sales.
Between July 1, 1919, and June 30, 1922,
they bought £806,552 worth of Australian
goods aud sold us goods valued at £10,211,990.
The commodities they imported were practi-
cally all raw material, such as greasy wool,
skins, hides and other animal substances;
the commodities they exported were mostly
manufactured articles competing with the
produce of Australian factories —agricultural
implements, various sorts of machinery,
steel bars and rods, leather and rubber
goods, motor-bodies, corsets, footwear, ap-
parel and attire. When Pearce was in
Nojth America on the holiday that cost
£B5OO he visited Ottawa. There he learned
that the Canadian Government would like
übthing better than to fix up a tariff agree-
ment with a country which bought £l2
6s. worth of goods from Canada for every
£1 worth it sold to her, and thought it was
doing famously. Pearce brought the glad
news home to llEghes, his then boss and
fellow-Freetrader, and Hughes was so
thrilled that he invited Robe, Canadian
Minister of Commerce, to come to Australia
and arrange the business, adding, with the
eocksureness that dstinguished him in
those days, that the impending ejection
would not interfere with their negotiations.
It was a bad guess. When Robb arrived by
the first available steamer lie found the Gov-
ernment so immersed in its mortal struggle
that it hadn’t time for anything else. He
bad only caught a few fleeting glimpses of
Rodgers, Minister of Customs, when that
gentleman and four other Cabineteers lost
their seats. During the eleven chaotic weeks
that elapsed between the election and the
advent of the Bruce-Page Government the
interesting stranger decided to go back to
Ottawa. But before his departure he graci-
ously intimated that, in token of its great
love for Australia, Canada was ready to
accept the preferential duties accorded to
the produce of the United Kingdom. The latter
country, in 1921-22 alone, bought Australian
goods valued at £57.100422 and sold us
goods valued at £53,001,926. The argument
in favor of preference to Britain is that it
is far and away our best customer, whereas
Canada is decidedly the worst. Asked how
Australia would benefit by giving its worst
customer the same concessions as the best,
Mr. Robb held out (he hope that his
country might buy a hit more greasy wool.
Then, remembering that Australia needed no
reciprocal duties to find a market for greasy
wool, he spoke vaguely about citrus and dried
fruits. The gentleman didn’t mention that
the Canadian demand for these articles' is
relatively small, and is abundantly supplied
by California, Canada’s neighbor and Aus-
tralia’s too-suceessful competitor; or that if
Australia cau get preferential duties on dried
fruits from Britain —and the prospects are
pretty good—it won’t mind leaving the
Canadian market to the Californians. Since
Mr. Robb returned to Canada negotiations
have been conducted over the cable. The
S. M. Herald asserts that Canada has
offered to place dried fruits on the free list
if Australia will reciprocate in the matter
of timber. Bruce’s statement is that
“Canada will not grant preference to dried
fruits unless she obtains the whole of her
requests.” What these “requests” are he
has not explained, but the sudden outbreak
of propaganda in the interests of Canadian
manufacturers suggests that they are suffici-
ently menacing to Australian industries. To
lower the duties that protect these industries
at a most critical stage of their existence
would be an act of blind folly, whatever the
inducement. To expose them to the danger
of being snuffed out by highly organised
competitors, and that to oblige' a country
which happens to be our very worst cus-
tomer, and which offers us nothing but a
shadowy expectation that it will be a small
buyer of currants and raisins, would be a
political crime of the first magnitude. The
Bruce-Page Government had better not
attempt it. Its attitude should be that Aus-
tralia will be charmed to discuss tariff re-
ciprocity with the sister Dominion when the
Canadians prove their kona-fides by purchas-
ing Australian goods of the same value as
the goods they sell to us. Meanwhile the
negotiations shall remain suspended.
Dark Places.
“The dark places of the earth are full of the habi-
tations of incapacity.” —Psalm Ixxiv, 20, with an im-
perceptible variation.
From the Northern Territory there generally
comes something new, though little or no-
thing that is good has been heard from there
since South Aus. let go its hold. During the
long, disastrous period of Federal owner-
ship it has, save for one brief interval, been
under the rule of the orthodox latter-day
Laborite. His almost invariable record is
that he became a trades-union secretary, and
by the usual amount of public speaking and
by giving satisfaction with the simple
accounts and the membership cards, he earned
a party nomination and was made a states-
man. Success has been strictly limited even
when the ex-trades-union secretary was close
to his job. When he was 3000 miles from it,
and there were no infuriated local members
to shout in his ear, good results have been
nil. The latest cry of wrath from the Terri-
tory, which has an articulate though not a
voting member now, is about the railway
workshops, situated 2| miles from Darwin:
The locomotives are old and obsolete, and should
have been scrapped years ago... .The issue of oil is
under no supervision, and everyone helps himself.
Thousands of sleepers have been taken off the rail-
way line and bridges, placed in big heaps, and heap
after heap has been destroyed by bush fires, though
the firewood could be utilised at pumping-stations
and elsewhere. Men who light the locomotive fires
have to prowl round the yard for firewood.... There
is no storekeeper at the shops, and if anything is
wanted out of the store sometimes half a day is
spent in getting a cycle in order to bring the store-
keeper from Darwin, take him back, and return the
cycle to the shop.
Thousands of pounds worth of hoppers are lying
without wheels, with trees growing through them.
Cattle-trucks are in an unpainted condition. When
the visit of the chief mechanical engineer was
pending, the wheel bearings of trucks and engines
which had been lying out in the weather, with rust
one-sixteenth of an inch thick, were white-leaded
over. An employee was occupied five days in clean-
ing up the tool store, where hundreds of pounds
worth of tools were so rusty that the size brands
could not be distinguished. The moulder’s shop,
which is practically new, is in a similar condition.
It is the land of sixes and sevens, of debris
and chaos. The collapse isn’t, due to the
closure of Yestey’s big meatworks, as some-
times alleged. When South Aus. handed the
place over (which was also when it ceased
to have any voting power), the average trade
for the previous tfour years (imports and
exports) had been £344,308. That was,
roughly speaking, £lOO per head per annum,
which was something to be proud of. And
four-fifths of it was export trade, for the
place was really a source, of some wealth.
The entrances and exits at Darwin in the
last years of the old regime consisted of
175 ships with a tonnage of 256,910, and
the train ran twice a week on the little rail-
way, and had no time to get rusty. Now
Vestey’s has come, and been, and suspended,
so the position is, in theory, what it was.
In reality it isn’t. The trade figures, being
kept on a different plan, can’t be compared
so far as value is concerned, but at latest
advices the number of ships for the year
was down to 34 and the tonuage to 70,955.
The cargo which arrived was 4881 tons, in-
cluding Government stores, and the cargo
sent out was 513 tons, for the place has got
out of the habit of having things to sell. The
line is a little longer now, but the train
runs once a fortnight, and the manner of
its running has been described. A Federal
Minister of the orthodox ex-trade-union sec-
retary variety has been up to the isolated
place on the three-yearly-or-so visit of in-
spection. He is the one who, for seven con-
secutive years and some odd ones, was re-
sponsible for the Ordnance Department, and
people who have had dealings with that re-
markable bear-garden hardly regard him as
an ideal reformer. If the Federal railway
boss was liable to drop in any evening by
the daily train from the South, instead of
his arrival by sea being a journey of weeks
or months, with progress reports all along
the route, the rust wouldn’t be so thick. But
isolation is the devil, and indifference and
stupidity are the other members of an unholy
trinity.
Chaos in the Marriage Market.
It is understood that the “Ne Temere” row
will be renewed shortly in the N. S. Wales
Assembly, and perhaps it may lead to an
intelligent consideration of the demented
condition of the State’s marriage and divorce
laws. The presumption at the base of these
laws is that the female partner is an illiter-
ate serf or chattel. In the recent Peel case
(Eng.) a husband and wife engaged in a
betting swindle. The wife provided the
money and fully 50 per cent, of the cunning:
the husband was convicted and sentenced,
while she was discharged on the theory that
a wife in criminal matters always acts
under her husband’s duress! In this part
of the world the following obstacles to true
morality are presented by different authori-
ties in the name of morality, religion or the
law: —
No divorce will he granted if the Court has
reason to believe that both parties are eager for
their freedom. That is to say, in theory. In
fact divorce judges recognise that 99 per cent, of
restitution suits are collusive, and are practically
driven to forswear themselves in the interests of
humanity. “There is no chicanery, no trick, which
Judges are not compelled to employ in administer-
ing the laws of divorce,” observed Lord Birken-
head the other day in reference to the English
bench, and the remark is equally true of our Judges.
No divorce will be granted, unless in exceptional
cases, where both parties have “sinned.”
No divorce will be granted in the case of an
irretrievably ruined marriage where the legally
innocent party (who is often the guiltier one mor-
ally) elects to remain married. The motive in
these cases is usually revenge. A husband deserts
his wife, say, and she has a child by another man.
Clearly it is in the interests of the State and the
child that the couple should be allowed to regular-
ise their union. The law' says they may not if the
husband decides to punish them by refusing to
divorce her.
An official is specially maintained by the State
to smell out cases of collusion, with the object of
re-riveting the bonds on those w r ho have induced
the Court to remove them.
The R.C. Church refuses —except under certain
stringent conditions —to marry Catholics and Pro-
testants ; and it denies the validity of such marriages
w'here they have been performed by Protestant
ministers or registrars.
The R.C. and Anglican Churches deny the validity
of divorce, and refuse to re-marry even the innocent
party to a divorce suit.
■ But “No church will refuse to marry a septua-
genarian to a 20-year-old girl; or a person suffer-
ing from T.B. or venereal disease to one who is
healthy ; or a' man of notoriously infamous character
to a girl who may be too innocent to understand
w'hat infamy means.”
Any change that is brought about in the N.
S. Wales marriage or divorce laws can only
be temporary ; it was expected that Common-
wealth uniformity in this regard would have
been provided for in the first legislative pro-
gramme submitted by the Bruce-Page
administration, and at the worst the reform
cannot well be delayed much beyond the life
of this Federal Parliament. Nevertheless,
an intelligently-framed N. S. Wales measure
might serve both as an inspiration and a
goad in the larger sphere. Broadly, it would
begin by propounding that woman is man’s
full equal in the eye of the law, civil and
criminal; and that no church has a right
to interfere in the making or breaking of a
marriage contract. Under this law no
marriage would be valid unless performed by
the State, and any churchman who denied
the legality of such a. union might be made
liable to a criminal libel action. And simi-
larly with any churchman who denied, ex-
pressly or by implication, the legality of
divorce. Collusion would be done away with
as an offence —in fact, it would be encour-
aged. Where a husband and wife were living
apart, where the Court was satisfied there
was no hope of a reconciliation, and where
one (or both) was living in sin, the Court
would be empowered to grant a divorce on
the application of either. (The present
hypocritical rule about parties having to
come to the Court with “clean hands” is re-
sponsible for much of the chicanery of which
Lord Birkenhead recently complained.)
And every party to a marriage contract
should be a potential producer of a healthy
child; i.e., be healthy and of a marriageable
age. Under this system there would actu-
ally be fewer divorces if only because there
would certainly be a far greater proportion
of happy marriages.
Elective Ministries.
An Australian who has been in Parliament
for 20 years, and has himself reached Cabinet
rank, contributes his conclusions: —
Our present system of government, -which makes
Parliament subservient to its Executive, utterly
destroys the usefulness of Parliament as a representa-
tive body. The only remedy seems to be to allow
the elected members to choose from amongst their
number those really best fitted for executive respon-
sibility, irrespective altogether of party. The latest
Constitution in the British Empire is that of the
Free State of Ireland, and this lays down the old
Bulletin principle of Elective Ministries. The docu-
ment was drafted by British Ministers, and inclusion
of this principle by them is an admission of the
failure of our own.
To summarise the weaknesses of the system we in-
herited :
It makes Parliament the mere playground of
party and personal interests, by encouraging waste-
ful and costly efforts to depose Governments.
It results in bad laws, because of the abject sub-
mission to sectional discipline and the fear of an
appeal to the electors.
It places too much power in the hands of the
leader of the Government, who has the right to
pledge his Ministers and threaten them with dis-
missal.
It denies to the State the services of good men,
because they may happen to have the wrong political
brand upon them.
It encourages laxity in administration and careless-
ness in legislation, because of the security of Minis-
terial tenure, born of the implicit subservience of
party followers. Ministers are no longer dismissed
for political offences, but retain executive power,
often at the loss of political honor and even self-
respect, so strong is the disinclination to allow the
opposing party to succeed to office.
But probably the worst feature of the system is
its tendency to lower the intellectual capacity of
the House. Men are returned to Parliament under
the backing of a party who would have no earthly
chance of success on their merits. Public-spirited
men refuse to offer themselves as mere creatures
of a system that crushes individuality, and deprives
them of freedom, of conscience.
On the other hand Elective Ministries would break
down the frightful waste and follies that follow
upon the intrigues of party managers. They would
give free rein to the judgment of members. They
would cultivate a public spirit, now almost absent
from our public life, and lend an incentive to the
capable to use his talents for his State, and enable
him to offer his services as an executive officer of
the Crown. They would take away a despotic power
from a few, and transfer it to what should and
would be a free Parliament, subject only to the
electors. They would stop useless dissolutions of
Parliament, and at the same time eliminate much of
the bitter party strife. They would alter the objee
tionable tyranny ox Executives over Parliaments, and
put an end to the farce of one set of men trying
to do something’ while another' set tries to prevent
them.
In short, the system which British Ministers drafted
for the newest State under the Crown would 1 end the
bitter and costly party fights, purify the political
atmosphere, and set individual judgment free from
the fetters of false loyalty to persons instead of to
the State. It would transform the Parliament into
a business body, and thus make it respected, and a
place to attract the intellect of the country, instead
of being, as at present, merely a place offering a
refuge to men of mediocre ability, who waste the
public resources in their selfish efforts to retain their
places and to reach positions of power for which they
are totally unfitted.
A Temperance Deadlock.
Intemperance continues, partly because of
the intemperate attitude of most of the tem-
perance leaders, and partly because poli-
ticians are, with trifling exceptions, con-
cerned only to retain votes by annoying as
few organised bodies as possible. As in so
many ostensibly holy causes, obscure yet
bitter hatreds sway the majority of the con-
testants. The die-hard type of prohibitionist
—the fanatic who is capable of counting 120
drunken women in 10 wine-bars in eight
minutes, who regards all barmaids as “im-
moral decoys,” and who stands out for no
compensation either to publicans or to their
employees—proceeds on the assumption that
hotel-keepers are criminals for whom ruin
is good enough. America’s adventure in pro-
hibition has so far provided little nope that
the doctrine could be enforced in Australia
even as a Federal law. In the U.S.A., with
the navy doing its utmost to check liquor-
running and with millions of dollars being
spent on prohibition enforcement ashore,
there is no evidence that the cause of tem-
perance has benefited. And if effective pro-
hibition is more or less a dream so far as
all Australia is concerned, what hope would
a single State have of enforcing it? The
politicians in the mass are frightened of it.
They have seen enough of the U.S. experi-
ment to appreciate that if N. S. Wales, for
example, follows America’s lead, it will shortly
be offered the alternative between being
crippled financially or stultified on the admin-
istrative side. But some 55 M’s.L.A. in the
present N.S.W. Parliament have pledged
themselves to vote for a State poll at the
earliest opportunity, and to work for the
cause outside Parliament. The saving clause
in this contract, as they look at it, is
that the Liquor Act provides for com-
pensation, and that the sum required
(between 12 and 14 millions sterling) is
sufficient to ensure a “No” vote for all
time. There is not the slightest chance
of the compensation provision being taken
out of the Act: Minister for Justice Ley,
though himself a prohibitionist, described
that proposal as “Bolshevism.” And menu-
while the red-hot anti-liquor prophets out-
side Parliament and the tepid ones in Par-
liament are doing nothing constructive for
temperance, because the drunkard is the best
evidence of the villainy of their enemy the
pubkeeper. Temperance workers might do
a lot for temperance if they abandoned their
present practice of rushing into print with
yarns about being poisoned in bars
and seeing herds of intoxicated girls
in such places, and, instead, led the
police to these haunts of infamy; also,
if they ceased hurling imprecatory adjec-
tives at the “trade,” and, as an alternative,
began to hurl reformatory suggestions at it.
Ninety-five per cent, of the drink retailers
want to run their establishments respec-
tably ; and that the thing can be done has
been proved in the United Kingdom by the
Public-house Trust and other companies.
More tolerance and goodwill between those
who do not drink and those who do is what
we need in the interests of sobriety—until
the American drink policy definitely proves
itself to be worth imitating.
Importing V.D. at Reduced Rates.
No newly-arrived immigrant could liave made
greater haste out of the Commonwealth than
the 16-year-old who hanged himself the other
day within a few. hours of his arrival at
Fremantle. The doctors who examined the
corpse found V.D. Apparently the Com-
monwealth is ready to pay good cash not
only for new people who are themselves fore-
doomed to failure, but for those who may
bring suffering and misery to others. It is
a slovenly arrangement for which only poli-
ticians brought up in the school of' party
could be responsible. On this subject Ettie
Rout writes pertinently from London: —
A clipping received from Westralia states that
the agents of a shipping- co. were fined £lOO for
landing a “prohibited immigrant”—viz., a syphilitic.
If a similar fine were imposed on Australia House
for every diseased person it has been re-
sponsible for landing in Australia there would
be considerable additions to the revenue.
The present system of medical examination is a
perfect farce. No blood test is taken; hence any
syphilitic not showing- obvious signs of disease can
pass. No bacteriological examination is made:
hence any person suffering from gonorrhoea can pass
with ordinary luck. But what caii you expect for
I.os. 6d., especially when the immigrant pays?
Australia cannot afford to sell her blood inheritance
for the sake of solving Britain’s unemployment pro.
blem. Yet this is what she is being asked to do, or
beguiled into doing. A high official at Australia
House told me the other day that he thought we
shouldn’t be .“unkind” to English girls -who had
“picked up a germ of disease” during the war —
many poor girls had done so, and we should be sorry
for them. I am profoundly sorry for them, but
my sorrow does not extend to conniving at their
poisoning my fellow-countrymen. Another official
expressed the mob idea in mob lingo by telling me
pointedly that “some people had V.D. on the brain.”
My suggestion that this was far the safest place to
get the darned thing left him looking distinctly
more resentful than enlightened.
The Sub-normal Child.
Mrs. A. Lassetter, ivho for 10 years past
has been a member of the Cambridge Educa-
tion Committee, tells what has been done
there for physical and mental defectives: —
We provided two Special st ir ols for a population
of about 50,000. They were filled by classes of
children excluded from the Ordinary schools by order
of the school medical-officer. One was for the physi-
callv unfit—an open-air school ; the other for the
feeble-minded, including those who were unfit to

vork or associate with normal children. Beyond
the usual Government grant we needed at first only
an extra allowance to get a specia ly-trained head-
teacher to each school. The assistant teachers came
from the usual supply ; they were glad to get a year
or so of this Special school experience, and were
also qualifying themselves for posts of head-teachers
in Special schools. A separate class-room was used
for children unsuitable to be near harmless feeble-
minded children.
We found the bulk of the children had to be fed
in the schools at mid-day ; the parents sent money in
some cases, or else a sub-committee examined the
poverty-stricken cases, and money was provided by
private funds. Our temporary school for the feeble-
minded joined a communal kitchen, and we got the
food well cooked and at cost price.
In the Open-air School we kept the children from
8 a.m. to 6 p.m. These were children excluded by
the school medical-officer as unfit to be at the
ordinary schools—either because they were threatened
with tubercular trouble or were badly nourished,
under-weight and living under bad conditions. In
a very few weeks under the doctor’s care and advice
they became so well that, as a rule, they returned
to their ordinary school as sound enough. The re-
sults in many instances were no less than
astounding. The parents paid 2s. a week for the
breakfast, dinner and tea and (if ordered) milk
between meals. The children rested for two hours
each day on long canvas chairs where they could
lie flat, out of doors, in the garden, or under shelter.
In the majority of cases a few weeks or a few
months practically cured them.
Beyond these schools we had a cottage home for
the educatable boys who paid or who were paid for.
This home for feeble-minded boys was also a
class for observation for the Cambridge Med. School.
Everything was done to build up and improve these
boys, and a good number became so nearly normal
that they could return to their homes.
Members of the Education Committee ran these
schools as an experiment until the authority' realised
their enormous value. Now the Education Authority
has granted a big piece of land and is building two
Special schools to contain these two classes, with
kitchens and baths, run centrally'; it also undertakes
all expense incurred, regarding it as .an economical
scheme —economical, that is, to the taxpayer. The
Cottage Home is still run by a committee which is
interested in educating the feeble-minded to enable
them to be self-supporting and not a tax on the
community, and later on we hope the Government
will take it over. It is in this school that the dis-
tinguished family of the late Charles Darwin are
particularly interested.
We have nurses who go round the schools daily
and report cases to the medical-officers. Every child*
is expected to be examined each term by' the dentist;
a few parents prefer, and are allowed, to have the
work done by their own dentists instead. Verminous
heads or bodies are dealt with by prosecution by the
Cruelty' to Children’s Association if not immediately
attended to by''the parents. And, finally, we have
a good clinic, where a lady' doctor lives, in connec-
tion with our schools and infants’ welfare.
Australian mothers have a grievance in the ex-
treme rarity of corresponding institutions in this
country. Their absence is not only grossly unfair
to the defectives themselves and their parents; it is
also positively wicked to force normal children to
share their school-life with the feeble-minded.
Let Us Be Drastic.
A tribute from “Bourbon Romanoff” :
How statesmanlike the views of “Henry Horse-
collar" (B. 12/7/’23) in favor of “deportation on
a larger scale” appear when set beside the mawkish
claptrap uttered by Lord Birkenhead, in London,
on the same subject three days earlier 1 The former
Lord Chancellor prated of habeas carpus, and ob-
served that the argument submitted in justification
of the Home Secretary’s recent deportations was
“the most remarkable he had ever heard or read
from the lips of an Executive in attempting to pro-
nounce upon the liberty of the subject.” -
On every side nowadays one hears Bolsheviks, dis-
loyalists and republicans clamoring for what they
call “the rights of free speech and a fair trial” till it
appears as though we were back again in the rest-
less era of John Hampden. Hampden, it will be
remembered, was one of 200 Englishmen who were
imprisoned without trial in 1627 for refusing to sub-
scribe to and speaking against Charles I.’s forced
loan. “I could be content to lend,” said the recalci-
trant, “but fear to draw on myself that curse in
Magna Charta, which should be read twice a year,
against those who infringe it”—clear evidence of the
speaker’s pettifogging, police-court attorney’s mind.
Things went well with Charles for a while. Two
years later May was -able to write: “Some of the
greatest statesmen and Privy Councillors would
ordinarily laugh when the word ‘liberty of the sub-
ject’ was named.” But the same fatal leniency which
“Henry Horsecollar” identifies in our midst to-day
was eating into the vitals of the State. The agitator
Milton wrote his “Lycidas” and went scot free. “I
wish Mr. Hampden and others to his likeness were
well whipt into their right senses,” wrote the patriot
Wentworth from Ireland, where he claimed to have
made Charles “as absolute as any prince in the
world can be.” A certain amount of salutary punish-
ment in the way of imprisonment without trial was,
of course, meted out to sedition-mongers and other
malignants, but it was not, as “Henry Horsecollar”
would say, “wholesale” enough. The Scotch rising,
the Irish rising, the Cornish rising succeeded one
another, and finally England herself rose and Charles
lost his blameless head—all on account of the mis-
guided reluctance he and his Ministers had shown to
administer adequate punishment to extremists.
What produced the French Revolution but a feeble
dread of deportation on the grand scale? When
Necker fell in 1781, and a Government came into
power pledged to exclude from offices in the army
“all who cculd not prove four generations of nobility
on their father’s side,” it seemed as though brighter
days had dawned for France. Brienne deported most
of the Parliamentary Opposition, and eventually went
so far as to deport Parliament from Paris to Troyes.
Risings in Dauphinfi and Brittany followed. Had
“Henry Horsecollar" been in Brienne’s place he
would undoubtedly have “nipped this ferocious
and b’atantly confident conspiracy in the bud” by
“deporting every identifiable conspirator, and break-
ing up by every possible means the propaganda of
those not eligible for deportation.” Unfortunately
weaker men were at the helm; by July, 1789, there
were enough undeported revolutionaries to take the
Bastille, execute Louis XVI. and his wife, and either
execute or deport practically the whole of the
nobility. As in Charles IPs reign, one of the most
splendid opportunities that has ever presented itself
to a Government was lost.
An identically similar mistake was made in Russia
when, in October, 1905, the late Nicholas ll.—over-
persuaded by persons who had been corrupted poli-
tically by a study of English methods —promulgated
the principles of freedom of speech and the inviola-
bility of the person. It is true that he and his
Ministers immediately condoned his fault —or, rather,
crime—by deporting to Siberia without trial practi-
cally all who attempted to assert the right of free
speech. Privy Councillor Shcheglovitoff, who be-
came Minister for Justice in the first Duma, was able
to boast when the World War began that he had
effected the deportation of 30,000 republicans and
agicators by means of personally-signed edicts. Of
what value to the cause of law, order and justice,
however, was this handful in a population of 171
millions? In order to produce a beneficial effect, at
least 20 or 30 million advocates of free speech
should have been sent east, and for preference tipped
into Lake Baikal. Since no one in Russia possessed
sufficient vision and courage to get to work on this
AND FOUR PICKED MARRIED MEN DULY CARRIED OUT THE SENTENCE.
“wholesale” scale, the inevitable happened—an up-
rising, the slaughter of the Royal family and the
overthrow of the dynasty.
I would like to see “Henry HorsecoSj,ar” betake him-
self to England, and there lay before such men as Lord
Birkenhead and King George his views on how to
keep the populace orderly and well-behaved by de-
porting republicans wholesale. I would also like to see
their faces and hear their language on that occasion.
The modern Briton of the educated class has a posi-
tive craze for legality and constitutionalism, and he
looks on those who favor the brave, spacious methods
of a more disciplined eppch as dangerous to the
State. Still I have no doubt “Henry Horsecollar”
couid talk them round, and if he failed it would
always be open to him to suggest that they should be
deported.
Terror and T.B.
“Phthisis” : In London Justice McCardie
has just held that a man was entitled to
get out of a house of which he had taken a
lease on discovering that the previous occu-
pants had been tuberculous—a fact which
had not been disclosed to him. The judg-
ment will only cause the disease to be hidden
still more, and consequently more widely
disseminated. What is wanted is a simple
law that all vacated dwellings must be thor-
oughly fumigated before being re-occupied.
Any building can be treated so that disease
germs will be destroyed at the cost of a few
pence per room. The bacilli of tuberculosis
do not live for ever. Outside the human
body, even in the most favorable conditions,
six months would be their limit, while in
the usual type of unfurnished cottage a few
weeks would see their end. Sunlight or
fresh air kills them in a few minutes. Yet
people who delight in patronising public
restaurants and refreshment-rooms, and who
will sleep in hotel and boarding-house bed-
rooms or steamer- and train-cabins without
a qualm, will be panic-stricken if an agent
lets them a house which had been occupied
by a consumptive a couple of years before,
and had been painted and fumigated since.
The ideas held by most people on the sub-
ject; of infection are absurd. The N.S.W.
Society for the Prevention of Consumption
issues a pamphlet stating that a healthy
person may safely live not only in the same
house but in the same room with a consump-
tive provided a few simple precautions are
taken. This same society treats five or six
thousand active T.B. out-patients annually
at its evening clinics, nearly all of whom
are by day following their usual avoca-
tions. The writer knows personally a dozen
medical practitioners who suffer, or did
suffer, from T.B. All lived for some time
quietly in the country, and most are still
doing so. All but two are married, and live
in the usual way with their families, and
have raised healthy children, and none
preach the panicky creed of segregation,
though all believe that early cases should
spend a few months in a sanatorium to learn
habits that will prevent them infecting others,
and to acquire the “rest, open air, good
food and graduated exercise” routine cal-
culated to bring the blood’s fighting powers
to their highest point. The great fact con-
cerning infection to be remembered is that
the only way the bacilli leave a consumptive’s
body is in the expectoration, and even then
they cannot get free until the sputum is
allowed to dry and disintegrate. The
bacilli are not mobile, they have no power
of locomotion, and can only enter the body
by being breathed in or taken in food.
Therefore a sufferer who carries a vessel to
spit into and habitually uses it is quite “safe” ;
yet to such an extent has fear of infection
been preached that a man has only to pro-
duce a sputum-flask and he is at once boy-
cotted socially, treated as something loath-
some physically, and his life made unbear-
able. Naturally, the T.B. resents this, and
nine out of ten refuse to take precautions.
If the disease is to be combated the medical
profession and health authorities must get
together and decide on a consistent policy
concerning infection and accommodation.
And instead of emphasising the infectious-
ness of the trouble the ease with which in-
fection can be destroyed and avoided must
be stressed.
Coal.
under pressure of necessity it has been dis-
covered at Adelaide that coal can be brought
as cheaply from England, two continents
away, as from N. S. Wales, next door. Con-
sequently another item may be added to the
list 01 imports, and so far as this year has
gvne they, have exceeded exports so much
that all the interest on all this country’s
foreign debts has had to be provided
out of new loreign loans. In all the other
btates theie exists a passionate desire to
get free of dependence on the N. S. Wales
coal-miner, with his fits and starts and
chronic “irritation strikes.” They have three
ambitions—to discover sufficient local sup
plies, to develop such electric power as will
make coal superfluous, and to find sufficiently
cheap ships to make importation feasible. A
suspicion prevails that the coal-miner some-
what mistakes his position in the scheme of
things. So possibly has the coal-owner, but
as he doesn’t publish strenuous political pro-
grammes he doesn’t make an exhibition of
the fact. The coal-man is not a producer in
the same meritorious sense as the farmer or
the weaver. He doesn’t make coal any more
than the whale-fisher makes whales. H e is
simply one who plunders Nature’s store-
house. To replace local with imported coal
is therefore not a loss in the same sense as
the displacement of local wheat or clothing
by the imported article. In fact, it would
be no loss at all provided the miner could be
set to producing as much at some other occu-
pation as would pay for the imported coal.
If the year’s output of wheat or boots or
pants fails the loss is never made good, but
the same coal which might have been mined
in 1923 may be mined just as well in 2023,
and if the world’s supply is then running
low it may be the better for keeping. The
present trouble (there is always a trouble)
in N.S.W. arises from the miners’ demand
for a sort of life-lease of their jobs—in other
words, no man is to be sacked for any kind
of misconduct or provocation of the kinds yet
invented. A bigger trouble is foreshadowed
in the proposition that the miners, taking
sole control of the industry, shall not be sacked
for misconduct or provocation even if it ex-
tends to raising prices 1000 per cent., and, at
pleasure, stopping supplies altogether. So
the idea that it might be found, or made,
possible to do without this rather doubtful
producer at a pinch—or to do without him
tor a century or so—fascinates a lot of
people. And the more it fascinates them
the harder they. scheme to show' that the
coal-mine—especially the coal-mine of N. S.
W ales—-isn’t half as indispensable as both
the owner and the miner thought it was.
•
“Hanno” : The Pharmacy Act of N. S.
Wales badly wants amending to stop all save
registered and qualified chemists from own-
ing and running chemists’ shops. Such
a provision exists in Victoria, but in
the parent State anyone may own and con-
duct a pharmacy as long as he keeps a
qualified chemist on the premises, nominally
as manager. The result is that people know-
ing nothing of pharmacy, and caring less, are
proprietors of shops, and the manager whom
the Law forces them to employ is often
enough some poor devil on his last profes-
sional legs. When a man possessing no
professional interest whatever in the calling
engages in it, his object, in nine cases out of
ten, is to make as much money' as he can,
and then to get out while the getting is good.
Naturally, the public suffers, and, in addi-
tion, such proprietors make a feature of ali
kinds of undesirable sidelines in conjunction
•with the ordinary business. Three of the
most notorious illicit drug-sellers in Svdnev
are unqualified proprietors, while about 50
per cent, of the others are under suspicion.
Pharmacy offers such a scope for the crook
that indiscriminate entry' into the trade
should not be granted to any untrained per-
son possessing enough money to open a shop
and hire a manager.
•
“Griffith M.”: This isn’t orthodox, but
that doesn’t make it untrue. Charity (just
enough to exist upon while prosecuting the
search for productive employment) is what
nine-tenths of the male unemployed need,
though it should be dispensed at widely-
scattered centres, and as little as possible
in the city. Charity —and not Government
work. Charity is at least paid for out of
revenue, while Government works are
charged to posterity, and are mostly run at
a loss wffien finished, so that posterity has
to pay that also. Charity is, it is true, held
to be degrading; but when public w'orks are
really charity they are just as degrading.
And, anyhow, 90 per cent, or more of the
workless are men who never acquired a
trade; and when, all his life, a man has
had nothing to offer in exchange for susten-
ance save what the carthorse also offers, his
muscular strength, he is somewhat degraded
already. A great part of the generation
w'hich has grown up under the regime of
unpayable public works, big loans and re-
stricted apprenticeship is really a bad debt,
and. should be regarded as in process of
liquidation. The Right to Work has been
stressed too much; the Duty of Knowing
How to Work a great deal too little. If a
man has only learned to smoke glasses
through which to observe eclipses, and the
community is expected to buy eclipses out
of loan moneys to keep him going, charity is
the cheaper method.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Bulletin gets almost annoyed
enough at times about it to wish there had
never been a war. The Turk isn’t to be
turned out of Europe, after all; in fact, he
is to get Constantinople and Gallipoli. But
the Greek population has been turned out of
Asia Minor, after 3000 years of occupation.
So Europe gets the worst of it. Abdul is
to pay the interest on his debt; but as he
can choose the currency it will probably
be worth 6d. per million' pounds. The Hun
is said to be the most lightly-taxed person
in Europe. He isn't paying much indemnity,
allegedly for lack of money; but there are
complaints in Switzerland that Hun capi-
talists with money to burn are buying up
Swiss industries wholesale —they are moving
into a new country, and leaving their debts
behind them. Still, the old country isn’t
so bad, and the boom in the building of rich
men’s mansions at Berlin is described as
unprecedented. Finally, Russia has got rid
of both its war debt and its pre-war debt,
and all hope of recovei’ing anything from
the mad frost at Moscow has been aban-
doned, Yet four short years ago it was seri-
ously debated whether the Hughes Govern-
ment shouldn’t raise a few’ millions on the
strength of our share of the indemnity.
According to a tale unfolded lately by Min-
ister Wearne, N. S. Wales has already spent
£14,000,000 of borrowed money in putting
8206 returned soldiers “on the land.” Now
comes State Statistician Smith with these
figures up to March of this year:—
Increase op N. S. Wales Population.
In Gav Metropolis. In Rest of State.
1917 .. . . '20,590 24,253
1918 . . . . 24,920 13,437
1919 .. .. 45,470 12,041
1920 .. .. 31,700 36,100
1921 .. .. 25,780 13,603
.... 1922 . . . . 29,300 16,316
So it seems that the more loan money Sisy-
phus gets for rolling the stone of settlement
on the land the less the stone rolls. Surely
it is time Governments realised that they are
on the w’rong track—that the borrowing of
millions fills the city and is therefore calcu-
: lated to empty the country rather than
settle it.
Canada is after a trade agreement with
the U.S.A. too. This is never mentioned by
the disinterested importers who urge the free
admission of Canadian manufactures in re-
turn for a probably worthless preference in
respect of dried fruit, but it is a fact, never-
theless. Ottawa has proposed to Washing-
ton that each country should halve its duties
on the other’s fish, wheat, hay, barley, oats
and various vegetables. The schedule is con-
fined to foodstuffs, there being no hope of
inducing the U.S.A. to modify its protection
of secondary industries, which protection, in
the course of half-a-century, has made it the
greatest manufacturing country in the w’orld.
Judging by the concessions asked of this
country, Australia is regarded in Canada as
a much easier proposition. That comes of
being represented abroad by a painted lath
like Pearce.
Fitzpatrick, N.S.W. Minister for Local
Government, made the usual speech at the
turning of the first sod of the Ivurrajong line
the other day, and implored local people to
stick to their railways and leave the motor-
lorries alone. That would be all very well
if railways were an end and not a mere
means to an end, that end being cheap car-
riage for passengers and goods. The trouble
is that the more of these hopeless lines Fitz-
patrick helps to build the more impossible
will it be for the railways to offer cheap car-
riage, and the more hopeless will the attempt
to settle the country be.
Redistribution of Vic. Assembly seats on
the lines proposed by Premier Lawson in
1920 —100 metropolitan electors to 60 coun-
try voters —will be strenuously opposed by
Allen and the 11 Cockies who follow him.
The F.U. party objects to six rural seats
being lopped off and given to the me-
tropolis. Nor is Labor keen on a
re-arrangement of boundaries that would
create, perhaps, three more Tory seats
south of the Yarra—the most expected
from any redistribution—and might endan-
ger Rogers (Melb.), Slater (Dundas),
Hogan ( Warrenheip), Hughes (Grenville),
Bailey (Port Fairy), and Clough (Bendigo
E.). The Government, in short, is strongly
tempted to do nothing, and will probably
yield to the temptation.
So far from getting testy when accused of
niggardliness, Vic. Treasurer McPherson
now takes the accusations as compliments.
Still, he rejoices that he has not so far been
placed in the same category as anither Scot
STATE-OWNED SHIPS.

as the others that leave your ports?”
who, when he found his wife dead beside
him, hurried down to tell the cook to boil
only one egg for breakfast.
Of course, this country needs much better
roads for wheel traffic; but well-made roads
are not -everything. One great difference
between this country and the U.S.A. is that
the U.S.A. burn their own petrol, and Aus-
tralia doesn’t. It is easy for Old Stodge,
M.P., to look up-to-date by urging this coun-
try to fly round in 5,000,000 “tin Lizzies,”
as" the Yankee is said to do, but too much
of that sort of thing may add 10 or 20 or
more millions per year to our imports bill,
which is too big already, and it must tend to
build our civilisation on a substance whose
supply will cease when war and blockade
come along, or when the supplying nations
begin to conserve their failing output. In
places the motor-tractor is the right thing;
but it is not a thing for Australia to get too
enthusiastic about. Its line, as a country
with much coal and no proved oil, fe to get
the best possible out of railways. Which it
won’t do while the railways are so absurdly
long and so insanely crooked.
Treasurer McPherson (Vic.) stands on a
pedestal, having just produced his sixth con-
secutive surplus. Unfortunately it and the
other five have produced no visible good
effect on the public debt. Australian finance
is built that way. However good McPher-
son may be individually, it is up to the State
to realise that the Government generally
went mad in 1918, and hasn’t had a lucid
interval since. It added £30,000,000 to its
debt in five years (details for 1922-23 are
not in yet) ; and the test of whether it was
money wisely borrowed and spent is to be
looked for in taxation. As the revenue from
taxation has just about doubled in the same
period, it is plain enough that the State has
been borrowing at about 6 p.c. to earn 3 p.c. :
and McPherson knows where that sort of
finance ends.
The fact that there are five parties in the
Vic. Assembly, not to mention McLachlan,
was emphasised as soon as members re-
assembled for the new session. Prendergast,
Labor-Opposition Leader, followed Acting-
Premier McPherson in paying a tribute to
dead Donald McLeod. Then came Allan, the
Cockies’ chief; Beardmore, deputy-leader of
the Truly Rural Libs.; and Farthing (no
less) as temporary commander of the metro-
politan Lib.-Conservatives. Had not mem-
bers been really depressed at the loss of
the old Daylesford warrior, the posing of
Beardmore and Farthing as leaders would
have provoked derisive laughter.
From the Federal Gallery:—
The electors of North Sydney will be disappointed
to hear that the promising young member they stole
from Bendigo is not putting up a record for attend-
ance in the Reps. When present, Hughes leads a
secluded existence in his room at the House, and
scarcely ever talks to anybody, his attitude to Bruce
being marked by distance and reserve. It is said
that he is brooding over Bruce’s alleged perfidy in
abandoning him after declaring at the elections that
he would sink or swim with his chief. But Hughes
is probably only affected by office-hunger, and there
are the usual dark rumors that he is biding his time
for an attack upon the Government. He is said to
enjoy the secret support of eight Nationalists, but
how he can exploit thisi to his own advantage nobody
knows. As a matter of fact, the feeling against him
is stronger than ever. A casual remark in the House
that he had. been responsible for unjust aspersions on
the soldierly character of ex-Gunner Yates, M.H.R. for
Adelaide, caused an unexpected outburst from Whit-
sitt, the new member for Darwin, and brought
Massy Greene’s successor to his foot (he has only
one) in defence of his brother Aussie. Though the
ueps. were discussing the question of compensation
to the injured Yates, it was the mention of Hughes’s
name that provided the spark for the explosion.
Prime Minister Bruce made a statement
which everybody would gladly believe, when
he ascribed the tales of mismanagement in
mandated New Guinea to German propa-
ganda. Assuredly the German, who is the
same German in all times and seasons, cir
culated stories as much as he could, and is
quite capable of inventing stories. The un-
pleasant feeling is that he didn’t need to in-
vent. The Northern Territory, with no war-
problems and no large black or hostile white
population, was an easy matter compared
with New Guinea, and under the late Gov-
ernment it was misgoverned into de-
population and beggary, for the one visible
reason that it had no votes to sell. Where-
fore people reluctantly believe the worst, and
hope that there isn’t something even worse
than that.
“Rotom”: The employer may not be free
from blame in connection with the poor
supply of apprentices, but it is idle to deny
that labor regulations directly militate
against boys securing positions in which a
trade might be learned. In our N.S.W.
village a mechanic does business as motor-
repairer, welder and general engineer. lie
knows his job, but the irregularity of cus-
tom prevents his engaging hands. He was
willing, however, to teach an apprentice, and
a youth, a neighbor’s son, was anxious to
learn; but the inspector coldly vetoed the
arrangement. Before the mechanic could
take an apprentice, he was told, the regula-
tion required that he should have two jour-
neymen at work. So he is still working along
on his own, and the boy who wanted to learn
a trade is out at nights with his lantern and
rabbit-traps.
N.S.W. Lands Minister Wearne has taken
a bold step by permitting a soldier-settler to
transfer his holding in a group settlement
to a civilian. It is a break from the policy
hitherto adopted, and probably a good one.
Group settlement has not proved much of a
success. In theory it was sound; in opera-
tion the advisory official on the spot was
ignored, and co-operation was mainly con-
spicuous by its absence. Slackers enlisted
the aid of politicians to secure concessions ;
in fact, the pernicious influence of the politi-
cian has played a large part in the failure
of the plan. Each settler enjoys the right
(and he is a rare bird who does not intend
to use it) to appeal against the value of
his holding. Consequently there are going
to be big losses owing to reappraise-
ment of nigh war-time values. Civilian
settlers will not enjoy this right. If such
men, after paying the outgoing Diggers for
their interest, can make a success of things,
it will be a powerful argument against re-
appraisement of values downward, which
may prevent further heavy loss without any
injustice to the dinkum soldier-settler.
There are no pubs in the Murrumbidgee
Irrigation area, but the district is “dry”
only in the same sense as the U.S.A. —offi-
cially. There are now 12,000 people there-
abouts, and most of them don’t want a profit-
seeking Bung in their midst. They are agi-
tating for a community hotel, to be run on
the lines of the one at Renmark (S.A.),
which has provided good revenue for local
public uses. This will require special legis-
lation, and until they can get it the irriga-
tors prefer to keep to sly-grog.
The Westralian Government came to the
conclusion recently that the distillation of
sandalwood-oil within the State would result
in more revenue than the £2 per ton royalty
which has been collected from the sandal-
wood-getters in the State forests, most
of the stuff going to China. The latest
forest regulation, therefore, prohibits the re-
moval of sandalwood from the north-west
portion of the State (i.e., north of the 26th
parallel) except for local distillation; and
licenses for getting the wood can only be
obtained by the bona fide firms engaged in
the distillation of oil within Westralia. To
give this new industry still further encour-
agement the Government now charges a
royalty of only ss. per ton, in place of the £2
charged when the wood went to China.
The most grandiose mass of stone. and
brick and pomp and mortar in Sydney is to
be lifted up to lodge the N.S.W. Rural Bank.
When the inevitable happens, and N.S.W.
breaks into three or four manageable States,
the swollen metropolis will have on its hands
a lot of palaces, built in imitation of the
Parthenon, only not paid for, which will be
too big for its fortunes. There will be much
letting-space in the Rural’s Coliseum, and a
sane and sanitary Government could hardly
do better than reserve the top floor for the
burning of the dead. Sydney is at last in
hopes of getting that rudimentary adjunct of
civilisation, a crematorium. But it is pro-
posed to do the city’s burning at Rookwood,
among the nasty tombs, where it will be
remote and costly, as if it was a beastly
burial instead of the clean and odorless pro-
cess it is.

The table covers the 10 years during which
this old concern has been a public co. In
1913 it issued 150,000 of £1 7 p.e. cum. prefs.,
and so far public interest has been confined
to that scrip. The directors now propose to
lift the restrictions on the transfer of ordi-
nary shares, and that decision has been
accompanied by interesting disclosures. It
appears that during the period of high values
and widely fluctuating prices the co. made
larger profits than those claimed by the pub-
lished accounts; but as the proprietors were
not greedy—they were content to receive 8
p.e. divs., though since £BO,OOO of the
£240,000 ordinary capital was issued for
goodwill the actual return was higher—the
management made large provisions for con-
tingencies. The co. got through the difficult
period of prices without any hurt,
and now £BO,OOO of the contingency pro-
vision has been made visible: it is taken in
as a reserve for “goodwill and contingencies,”
aiul off-sets the goodwill item for the same
amount on the other side of the accounts.
Profits of recent years need to be reconsidered
in the light of this disclosure: it means that
during the past seven years the co. has accu-
mulated £153.357 of profit besides giving ordi-
naries £132,000 in divs. Including this
£SO,OOO the average profit for the period has
been £51,347 p.a.
Portion of the inner reserves was appa-
rently included with liabilities in previous
balance-sheets. Partly because of the trans-
fer now made some big recent changes are
visible in this comparison:—

Four years ago heavy stocks bought in high
markets necessitated outside financial help,
and liabilities (including mortgages) totted
up £233,108. At the latest balance they were
down to £48,234, and the co.’s position was
very snug: cash and Government securities
alone were £24,431 larger than all accounts
owing, including provision for taxes. Since
1914, when the co. published accounts for
the first time, only £31,798 of new capital
has been got in, and the balance-sheet posi-
tion has improved in this way:—
1914. 1923.
Liquid assets .. £276,292 £349,177 Inc. £72,885
Fixed assets . . 207,520 211,682 Inc. 4,162

Liabilities 174,262 48,23> Dec. 126,028
Total visible improvement . . £203,075
In nine years the business has benefited to
the extent of £171,000-odd of accumulated
profit. No doubt there are still considerable
inner reserves: for instance, the balance-
sheet takes in properties at “under first cost
and market value,” and small holdings in
other cos. have been written right out. After
payment of last year’s final divs. the
£150,000 of 7 p.e. prefs. were backed by net
assets with a book value of almost £570,000.
The £240,000 of ordinaries are represented
by nearly £330,000 of assets apart from good-
will, and tha't makes their prospects look
rosy.

The directors report that last year’s opera-
tions were “not so satisfactory as previ-
ously” ; nevertheless, net profits fell only
from £15,208 to £15,018. The amounts dis-
closed are, however, subject to two qualifica-
tions: (1) Profits do not include earnings
of investments. The £d. does not keep all
its eggs in one basket: reserved profits,
now amounting to £42,000, have been in-
vested in gilt-edged securities and shares in
public cos., and interest and divs. therefrom
(£2500 disclosed for 1922 and £2OOO for
the past 12 months) are shown indepen-
dently of earnings from the timber-trade.
(2) The management does not reveal the
allowances made for depreciation; and in
past years there were indications of liberal
provision having been made for wastage of
assets. Actual earnings in any year cannot,
therefore, be gauged, without recourse to the
depreciation account, and inside knowledge
of the requirements under that head. It is
doubtful whether allowances for the past 12
months were as large as those in the years
vvhen trading was helped by construction
booms financed by large State borrowings.
Lately, however, home-building has become
more active again, and industrial expansion
has helped a revival. But even during the
industrial depression and period of falling
values, and when very large shipments from
overseas had been delivered, the timber trade
did not suffer much. In more competitive
industries—or, rather, in those in which
there was less mutual understanding—values
had to be chopped hard and heavy losses
showed up.
From the beginning Allen Taylor divs.
have averaged 10 p.e., but substantial
premiums were got from a couple of new-
share issues. The co. began in 1906 with
£60,000 paid up, but by 1914 £150,000 had
been called in. The position now looks very
comfy. Here are balance-sheet comparisons
going hack to 1914: —

Every £1 fully-paid is now represented by
assets with a book value of 265. 4d., and
the management certifies that those values
are thoroughly sound: fixed assets are in
“excellent condition” and floating assets in
“good order,” everything is “adequately in-
sured,” and trade accounts are labelled
“good.” Owing to heavy stocks, at May
31 liabilities were unusually large; but cash
and outside investments alone covered all
except £26,000 of the £66,000-odd owed.
Liquid assets in excess of all liabilities totted
up £102,419.

This old co. is provider of, or agent for,
practically everything Rocky and its back-
country requires: from hardware to cough-
mixture, explosives and face-powder. It is
also a shipping and insurance agent. The
business has been a great money-spinner,
but shareholders have not been greedy, and
its expansion has been financed by accumu-
lated profit. Paid capital in 1910 was
£96,750, and only £11.250 has since been
called in from shareholders. Meanwhile
£145,000 of reserves have been transferred,
making paid capital a quarter million; but
earnings have been so sweet that after, pay-
ing 10 p.e. regularly, together with an occa-
sional bonus, there are now £157,925 of
visible reserves to assist capital. The busi-
ness got through the period of slumped values
without damage, and notwithstanding that
the cattle industry has had a shocking time,
that mining has been depressed, and that the
recent drought caused trouble, the co. for
the 12 months ended March disclosed a net
profit of IS-}, p.e. on capital. That was after
making provision for taxation and bad debts,
and no doubt the latter required special con-
sideration, because, owing to adverse con-
ditions, the co. has had to carry many cus-
tomers for much larger amounts than usual.
Book debts have expanded in this way: 1921,
£71,969; 1922, £97,940; 1923, £124,675.
This shows how balance-sheet figures have
behaved during the past three years and since
1910;—*

During the past 12 months the balance of
the debenture debt was redeemed, and the
only outside liability now is in respect ot
current trading accounts, which were larger
at March 31 than at any previous balance.
But the position was very snug: cash on
hand, book debts and stocks more than
covered all liabilities and the whole of paid
capital. Properties, A.U.S.N. shares and
War Loan with a book value of £146,037
and probably most of that parcel is Govern-
ment securities —were additional backing for
capital. . Probably there are other reserves;
the business has been so prosperous that
The Bulletin would be surprised if some
book values have not been supported by re-
serves for contingencies provided from surplus
profits.

Fifteen years ago this co. was given the right
to sell electricity in the densely-popif lhted
suburb of Balmain in return for disposing of
the municipality’s garbage. The Act also
gave, it authority to extend its operations to
other suburbs, and the enterprising manage-
ment has made the most of its opportunities.
Though in recent years the City Council
Electric Department has encircled the field
captured by the co. and limited further ex-
pansion, the five municipalities served by it,
under agreements granting exclusive rights
with 19 to 44 years still to go, give it plenty
of scope for finding new customers. At
April 30 there were 12,784 consumers whose
bills for the year had totalled £132,949.
After paying all exes., spending £11,164 on
repairs and renewals, and paying £2750 inter-
est on £50,000 of 5} p.e. debentures, a bal-
ance of £66,656 was left. The directors set
aside £BOOO for taxes, and voted £5OOO to a
staff provident fund, leaving £53,656 nrior to
making provision for replacement of plant,
etc.- But as reserves during the year in-
creased by an unexplained £5OOO, the dis-
closed profit, after making allowances for
taxes and the staff, was £58,656. The true
net profit depends on the actual amount
required to cover the wear and tear of plant
and machinery during the period. The direc-
tors set aside £13,000 —each year’s appropri-
ations are shown in the introductory table
—but whether that was a fair provision or
more than adequate only those inside can
tell. Anyway, the P. and L. account, after
providing the £13.000, showed £6449 in ex-
cess of the £39,207 required by the 10 p.e.
divs., and that is good going. Besides the
reserves shown in the introductory table
there is £86,373 to credit of the depreciation
fund, eaual to 15 l>.e. of the book value of
depreciable assets.

1921 is shown hereunder: —

sundry creditors. Liquid assets totted lip
£51,919. The £50,000 of 5} p.e. debentures,
by the way, mature in May next. Their
redemption and the continued expansion of
the business prompt the announcement by
the directors that “prior to the next annual
meeting steps will possibly be taken to in-
crease capital.”

Two years ago, when markets collapsed,
shareholders had to go without divs. and
suppliers received no bonuses. For the year
ended March, 1922, reserves were dipped into
i • 70 to make distributions. Owing
chiefly to the better wool market, the co.
made a good recovery last year: 10 p.e.
was paid on £25,000 of capital, 30 p.e. of
wool commissions were refunded and 15 p.e.
of produce and stock commissions. After
providing £2OOO for taxes, the management
laid aside £1492. The following table shows
the turnover and gross profits for a number
of years:—

In the wool department earnings benefited
from sales of the carry-forward of previous
years The period opened with 9730 bales
unsold, but of that lot and 35,161 received
during the year all except 2347 were dis-
posed of. Meanwhile the handlings of hides,
skins, tallow, etc., have grown, and. not-
withstanding the wretched condition of the
cattle market, the eo. is now maintaining its
livestock figures, though they are not so
large as they were a few years back.
The business having outgrown present
warehouse accommodation, the directors pro-
pose to dispose of the co.’s Pyrmont pro-
perty and erect a building which will con-
tain “the latest and most up-to-date wool
show-floor in the State,” and calls have
already been made for portion of tlie funds
necessary. The balance-sheet position has
hitherto been obscured by the grouping of
assets : book debts were shown in one entry,
and all other assets were lumped. But the direc-
tors have altered the form of the accounts, and
at March 31 the co. is shown to have owed
£37,4o7—bank overdraft, £22,290; sundry
creditors, £15,117 —and on the other side
'fere liquid assets for £3l,2ll—book debts.
£25,211; War Loan, £3OOO. Miscellaneous
assets (plant, furniture, shares in other cos.,
etc.) had a book value of £5566. Freehold
and leasehold land and buildings were in-
cluded at cost (£52,305), and were protected
by a depreciation reserve of £6OOO.

Gross profits for the 12 months to March 31
were only, half those of the previous year.
Coke-burning industries were depressed, and
the co.’s troubles were aggravated by a
strike at Coalclilf colliery, from which sup-
plies are drawn. The ovens are on lease-
hold within conveyor-belt service, of the pit’s-
mouth ; in that way the promoters expected
to save tens of thousands of freight during
the currency of the lease. Prospects looked
so bright three years ago that the co. was re-
constructed and two ordinaries were issued
for every one previously held; leaseholds
were written up about £9OOO. works about
£50,000 and goodwill, was taken in at £lOOO
to provide the bonus scrip. Balance-sheet

A large amount of profit is required each vear
to write down leases and works, as the co.’s
rights have only 114 years to run. So
of £2BOl net profit earned last year £2500
was taken for depreciation. The co. would
have been much better-off from a dividend-
paying point of view if its figures had not
been inflated. Instead of having nrofits to
divide the directors have to use surpluses to
protect written-up capital. For original
shareholders the final result will be the same,
but the absence of divs. on both classes of

shares for the past year Is not cheerful. In-
cidentally, notwithstanding reduced earnings,
disclosed net profits were also affected by
the directors setting aside £2199 for income-
taxes against only £l3OO at the previous
balance, A year or so ago the co. extended
its interests to coal-mining: an area was
taken up near Mt. Ivembla, but whether the
co, will be enlarged to finance the opening
out and equipment has not been decided.
Testing is claimed to have been satisfactory,
and the directors forecast that the Illawarra
Colliery will “ultimately prove a valuable
asset,” Mt. Morgan assisted the coking en-
terprise with £40,000 of 6 p.c. debentures,
Which are being redeemed at the rate of
£3OOO p.a. The balance outstanding at March
81 was £19,000. There was £9840 owing-
otherwise ; and against that were cash,
£6656 j book debts, £7645; stocks, £1021;
investments (Unspecified), £4172, these liquid
assets totting up £18,494,
The underground fire in the B. H. Central
mine still looks serious. It is in heavily-
timbered, moving ground in the southern
corner, between the South and Block 10
leases, and there are few points of local
attack. The exact location has been diffi-
cult to determine, and nothing could be
done until an exhausting fan was put in
at the old Central Extended shaft, which
connects with the Central 500 ft. level west-
ward of, and just below, the fire area. A
similar fan, as a blower, has been installed
at the ventilation shaft, eastwards of the fire.
The two fans, which are of about 50,000
cub, ft. per minute capacity, have been bor-
rowed from the South mine, together with
necessary gear to give the fighters
a chance to come in behind the fire
with the fresh air while the smoke and
gases are taken westwards away from them.
Meanwhile, South officials are taking every
precaution to prevent gas coming into the
South: a curtain of water is being put down
from every available point near the South-
CeUtral boundary to saturate the old tim-
bered stopes down to the 525 ft. level. Block
10 mainshaft has been put into commission.
But no one was ready when the outbreak
occurred; in the first half-hour, when such
a lot might have been done, very little was
accomplished. The need for a regular in-
spection of gear and souad practice was
made very evident. A central fire station,
well equipped with apparatus, a trained
nucleus squad always at hand, and auxiliary
squads on each mine are absolute necessi-
ties, Beyond several firemen being slightly
gassed, there have been no casualties, but
about 700 men will be thrown out of work.
Nevertheless, there were serious possibilities
beyond that. The Central has only one haul-
ing shaft. The B. H. Prop, and, Block 10
are idle, the latter’s hauling shaft being out
of commission, and there are no connections
with the South mine. In these circum-
stances it was very fortunate that all hands
were got up without mishap.
The British Australian Co., formed by the
Baillieus to take over the B. H. British mine
from the old London-controlled co., held its
first statutory meeting in Adelaide the other
day. Ostensibly the Australian co. was formed
to evade double taxation, but the fact is that
it offered an easy way out of the fight which
was brewing over the war-time arrange-
ment made with the Associated Smelt-
ers. Chairman Woodhead, w-ho arrived
from London last year breathing blood and
fire, retired when the change-over occurred,
and it now transpires that he receives £BOOO
of the gate-money as a solatium. At the
recent meeting in Adelaide the shareholders
were informed that the threatened argument
with the Smelters bad been dropped. For the
first time for many years ore reserves are
below a million; there are now 880,000 tons,
equal to about four-and-a-half years’ life at
present rate of extraction. Probably the
British could dig up more, but the grade is
on the low side. No mine at the Hill has
been more thoroughly prospected by diamond
drill and otherwise. At present Collins
House is considering whether it might be
worth while tacking on the neighboring
Junction and Block 14 properties, which
would considerably augment reserves.
* ' * * *
A syndicate in 152 £2O shares is being
formed in Orange (N.S.W.) to test the near-
by Mt. Lindsay area for silver, lead and
copper. Down 110 ft. in a 150 ft. shaft a
crosscut connects with a tunnel which had
been driven 300 ft. into the eastern side of
the hill. Work has been confined mostly to
the oxidised zone, and the syndicate proposes
to drive the tunnel another 50ft. and also
explore tbe sulphides. Adjacent areas are
marked for attention by pup syndicates.
Promoters and officials are taking scrip for
their services.
“Generally the co.’s outlook is brighter
than it has been for many years,” is the
cheery optimism of Austral Malay directors
in their latest report. Asam Kumbang
wiped off its debts during its last financial
year, and is now in the list of div.-payers.
Ulu Yam is also a profit-earner, and should
also begin distributions to shareholders be-
fore long. At present it is satisfying credi-
tors. Divs. on Austral Malay holdings in
these cos. are to be passed on to its share-
holders. One of the early floats, Kampong
Kamuntiug, contributed £l4OO of divs. to
funds during the 12 months to December
31 last. Apart from these holdings, Austral
Malay hopes centre in the Mergui area,
Lower Burma, where work to date indicates
at least 600 acres of 15ft.-ground averaging
about per yd. A new co., Thabawleik
Tin Dredging, Ltd., with an issued capital of
£160,000, is proposed, and Austral Malay
expects to retain a one-fourth interest, be-
sides recouping all its prospecting expend.ture
since Ulu Yam was floated. With tin at
£2OO, a distributable profit of 25 p.c. p.a. on
capital is expected. The search for
a new property in the State of Johore dis-
closed nothing worth while, and no definite
results have shown up from prospecting ou
the gold-dredging area in Upper Burma.
Engineer Burrows has not given up hope,
and arrangements have been made to extend
the option and look deeper into the proposi-
tion towards the end of the year.
* * * *
For the current year Asam Kumbang
(F.M.S.) is expected to produce at least 40
tons oxide per month. The directors have
decided not to put a second dredge to work
at present. They “believe that at the end
of 15 or 20 years the present dredge—one
of the finest in Malaya—will still be an effi-
cient machine, and if it is considered desir-
able at a later date to instal additional plant,
it may then be possible to purchase a second-
hand dredge at a very moderate price, as
Malaya is at the present time more than
over-equipped with bucket dredges.” In the
early part of its latest financial half-year
Asam Kumbang was in shallow, low-grade
ground, but the plant then nosed into the
“body” of the mine, and good results are ex-
pected for many years. The 727,000 yd.
handled during the six months gave 210 tons
oxide; costs took 3.87 d. and a working profit
of 2fd. (£8416) was made ;
Kampong Kamunting’s two dredges have
also moved into better ground. A monthly
output of 75 tons oxide is expected, and,
with tin at present prices, Bs. per share divs.
should be possible this year. For the six
months ended December 31 last 383 tons
oxide were won from 1,034,000 c. yd., an
average of 0.831 b. per yd. Working costs
ran out at 4.17 d„ and the working profit
was 4.34 d. Dredge renewals took £3070, and
a net profit of £15,043 remained after pro-
viding for wastage of assets. The co. holds
25,000 Asam Kumbangs, and it received 6d.
per share during the period and
Is. 6d. since. Meanwhile Ulu Yam has re-
paid a substantial portion of advances made
by Kampong Kamunting. Cash and invest-
ments now amount to £62,193, and the direc-
tors propose to take up 28,000 shares in the
Thabawleik float, and, later on, distribute
this scrip and the whole or part of the
25.000 Asam Kumbang shares to Kampong
holders, and then reduce capital. This dis-
tribution would leave ample funds for seek-
ing and purchasing another property. No. 1
dredge has about five years’ work ahead of
it, and No. 2 nearly seven years’.
* * • * *
Tongkah Compound proposes to increase
its capital by raising the amount payable on
shares from 6s. Bd. to 20s. each to provide
cash to pay for the new cutter-dredge that
Thompson’s foundry, Castlemaine, guaran-
tees will treat 100,000 yd. a month at about
half the cost of a bucket-dredge. The plot
to be tackled is close to Seremban, and 676
bores put down by A. C. S. Macleod have
proved 139 acres to contain 6,054,840 yd.
averaging 0.981 b.; 3,920,400 yd. in 90 acres
going fib.; and 195 acres giving 7.187,400 yd.
of 0.591 b. average. With tin at £173, hand-
ling 100,000 yd. per month at a working cost
of 3d. per yd. and recovering 90 p.c. of metal,
chairman Meagher estimates profits of
£280,000 to show against the estimated cost
of £36,500 for equipment. If Thompson’s
suction-cutter plant can do the work at 21d.,
as they guarantee, tin-winning on selected
areas will be revolutionised. The Compound’s
profit anticipations depend on actual per-
formances living up to engineers’ estimates.
The co. expects to get to work on its new
area with 3s. per share calls.

The latest oil float is Leongatha Oil
Wells, N.L., which has taken over the in-
terests of the Speed Oil Wells Syndicate,
whose 350 £lO contrib. shares were sub-
scribed in two days. Vendors take the same
number of fully-paids and £4OO cash, these*
stiff terms being dictated by the competi-
tion for the area. The 240 acres covered
by the mineral lease adjoin the ground held
by the South-Eastern Oil Co., Leongatha
(Vic.), which has received the blessings of
Russian engineer De Hautpick. The lure
is in half-a-dozen seepages and “mud vol-
canoes with abundant gas emanations.” Mel-
bourne analyst A. 11. Koch declares that
the oil is “genuine mineral oil,” and accoun-
tant C. C. Jackson vouches for the collec-
tion of the samples. The co. proposed to
commence drilling a 2000 ft. hole at once, but
Gippsland’s roads are in a bad state owing
to wet weather, and the transport of drilling
gear has been delayed.
* * * *
Mersev Valley Oil Co. at latest was
battling' with a big flinty boulder in its
deep borehole. De Hautpick chose a spot
in a valley at the foot of an unmistakable
anticline for the site of this hole, and he
is still confident he will hit the oil sands in
October. The Adelaide Oil Co. diamond
drill is down to 1000 ft. close by, and has
suspended work to get another boiler. The
trend of the tertiary rocks has now been
proved by numerous shallow test-bores to
be dipping north-east towards Port Sorell,
and the country seems to have been an an-
cient marine estuary.
Newton Moore’s advocacy at the Gt.
Boulder meeting of an amalgamation or co-
partnership of mining cos. at Kalgoorlie re-
peated what The Bulletin has urged for
many years. Kalgoorlie has a lot to learn
from S’Africa respecting concentration of
holdings and consolidation of labor effort.
At present Boulder, Horseshoe and Ivanhoe,
which could be worked in one group, and
Lake View, Associated. Perseverance and
South Kalgurli in another group, all have
independent managements and treatment
plants. If the groups were worked under
a system of concentration of holdings, such
as ' prevails at Johannesburg, overhead
charges could be reduced and several plants
scrapped, and bigger returns could be made
to shareholders by treating ore in enormous
quantities. Lower-grade ores could be
handled at a profit, and the life of the field
would be considerably lengthened.
The Australian and General Exploration
Co. (London), which recently acquired Gt.
Fingall’s belongings, has for years been a
large holder of Fingall scrip, and is well
known in Westralia. As the London and
West Australian Exploration Co. it held big
interests in Sons of Gwalia, East Murchi-
son United, Cue Consolidated and Kalgoorlie
Trams, and it worked mines on its own
account. Labor disputes, heavy working
costs and poor developments hampered its
operations, and some years ago it left the
West in disgust. Whether it intends to re-
open the old Fingall mine or utilise the cash
resources acquired from the latter co. for
operations elsewhere is not known.

Dave Murray pulls down the blind upon the
Duke and Main Leads, Maryborough (Vic.),
after distributing 235. per 100 shares as a
final surprise. This came from the sale of
the old gravel-dumps, once regarded as a
nuisance but now in demand by concrete-
workers. Dick Glover, under McCrorey, ran
the Duke and Main Leads for 13 years, and
knocked 108,000 oz. gold out of the show. The
average per fathom was about 12-£dwt.; and,
although all except 2s. 6d. per fathom went
to the worker, the co. cut up about 345.
per share on its 50,000 issue, paid to 245. 7d.
The' claim covered the junction of the Main
Leads and the Duke gutter. When mining
got away from the area affected by the tri-
butary, the bottom of the Duke lead became
uneven, the runs of gold narrow and the
water heavy. Then 124dwt. did little more
than cover half-costs, and the rails were
torn up.

From Papua:—
Block 10 Misima was never given a chance of
proving itself a div. payer. The venture from the
beginning was marked by faulty management which
would have killed a much richer mine. Incompe-
tence and wastefulness have been features. For
instance, there was the tram line; for a few hun-
dreds a plantation could have been bought which
would have provided a good grade to the zigzag
and shortened the line by half to three-quarters of
a mile. Instead, a tunnel was blasted through a
coral cliff, and that work alone must have cost more
than the price of the plantation ; the deviation also
added to the length of line, which was laid when
rails were at about their highest price. Not only
was the capital cost heavier, but the line gave a
bad lead up to the zigzag, and the cost of the up-
keep of the longer route is a permanent charge. At
present two trips per day is the best that can be
done, whereas had the line gone through the planta-
tion three trips could have been made.
Another costly blunder was that most of the em-
ployees were obtained from Westralia. Their fares
and half-wages were paid until their arrival f.t
Misima. Even a bricklayer was imported from
Westralia, and he remained a single day. The men
came from a dry to a very moist climate, and could
not be expected to be as efficient as Queenslanders
who had had Papuan experience. The W.A. and
Broken Hill men had no knowledge of native labor,
and as a result practically all work was over-
manned. The surface staff was out of all proportion
to the underground team.
For its general manager the co. required not so
much a mining expert as a good organiser with a
knowledge of local conditions. Papuan “boys” do
most of the work while whites supervise. With
capable management throughout, and a properly
organised labor team, there were possibilities in
Block TO Misima. Old miners appreciated the posi-
tion; when they were under notice to leave some of
them were anxious to secure the show on tribute.

Oaks Consolidated and the Madden-
Buchanan-Palmer syndicate have joined up
to test Mt. Buchanan. For its properties the
syndicate takes 10,000 fully-paid 10s. prefs.
and 10,000 contrib. prefs. paid to 4d. on
allotment. Holders of these 20,000 shares
will have first call on profits up to £lOOO per
month. The public is offered 10,000 shares,
and if development work is encouraging Oaks
undertakes to instal its plant free of cost.
Preliminary testing is expected to cost about
£lOOO, the first objective being to ascertain
whether the huge lodes improve with depth.
Every sample carried gold, values ranging
from' ldwt. to 12dvvt., while 00 samples
averaged sdwt. If average values improve
slightly, there are immense possibilities. A
shaft at the foot of the mountain is in sul-
phides going half-an-ounce, and at present
that find is putting heart into those inter-
ested. The Oaks co. kept going on 3dwt.
ore for years, and Buchanan gold is worth
84s. against Oaks’s 685., a difference equal
to 4dwt. per ton. Hopes are entertained that
the rich alluvial won from the gullies was
shed from the surface ore. Shaft-sinking is
to commence shortly.

The promising new show, the Jugular, on
the Kangaroo Hills field (N.Q.), now under
option to John Lennox, has been proved to
carry good shoots down to 100 ft. The lode
runs to 4ft. in places, and two separate
shoots carrying rich ore have been struck, the
bigger being up to 18in. wide. The bottom
shoot is almost pure tin-stone in parts, and
would probably assay 50 p.c. Roughly 40
tons of 20 p.c. ore have been raised so far;
a recent crushing gave 6 tons of concentrates
from 32 tons. Cullen’s shaft is being pushed
down by Lennox, and he is driving both
ways. The north-east level shows 15in. for
over 10ft., but exploratory work is the object
till the option expires, and no attempt is
being made to raise high-grade stone. Even
as it stands the show looks like carrying a
permanent lode with numerous shoots of
good ore. Underground should be cheap
on account of the soft formation.

“Van Cat”: Private Shrewdhead was
more of a batman than a fighter, and his
brightest achievements on service had been
done in connection with the padre’s leggings.
By judicious wangling he succeeded in help-
ing on the weary war from a safe possie
for about two years, but at last our Baft,
had his unwilling presence thrust upon it.
Naturally, lie was more critical about the
commissariat than any veteran of the
trenches. Some days after his advent the
bread ration slipped on its way from Rouen,
and the order was eight men to a loaf. Pri-
vate Shrewdhead received his transparent
slice on his handkerchief, and strolling over
to ■ the sarge demanded. “What’s this?”
"Bread, you blinking owl,” returned the
n.e.o. “Oh, yes, I know it’s bread all right;
but what’s it for?” questioned the dingbat.
“Your ration for the next 24 hours,” he
was told with no more profanity than the
question demanded. A look of relief came
over the ex-batman’s face. “Ration!” he
murmured. “I thought you was getting
ready for Communion !”
MONEY WELL SPENT.
“It costs a lot to live these days.”
“Yes; hut when you come to think of it its
worth a whole lot more.”
“Wilfrido”: The discovery by a warder
at the Mt. Eden (M.L.) gaol of a large
piece of electric-liglit conduit and some iron,
twisted and clasped together by wire so as
'to form a hook, was responsible for a novei
and entirely successful defence being set up
by the man upon whom suspicion fell. The
prisoner declared that the clumsy contrivance
was certainly not of his making, as lie knew
five ways by which lie could escape without
any bother. He had been engaged in the
construction of the gaol in 1903, and, through
a number of enforced visits since, was fam-
iliar with the weaknesses of the place. The
beak was sceptical, but the man. put to the
test, freed himself in a couple of minutes by
wriggling through the bars of his window
to the path outside. His candidness, how-
ever, while it cleared him of the charge
of making strange implements for an unlaw-
ful purpose, did not secure him a remission
of any part of the six years he is serving.
He got his sentence for stealing the auxiliary
yacht Rata, which, with two others, he navi-
gated. by the aid of a ,school atlas and a
ruler, from Auckland to Yeppoon (Q.) —a
feat not unworthy of nautical record.^

“Bare”: In reading Sister R. A. Kirk-
caldie's enumeration of the varieties ot
wounds with which hospital experience
familiarised her (B. 5/7/’23), I was sur-
prised at the mention of bayonet wounds as
if they were not uncommon. Though I spent
an aggregate of over three years, as a patient,
in different hospitals, and though I saw men
suffering from all the wounds she mentions
and some others that were worse, I nevei
saw a bayonet case, nor do I think I met
any Digger who had. ~ The general opinion
was that a bayonet wound, what with internal
bleeding and shock, was so severe that the
recipient, if not killed on the held. ne\ ei
got past the C.C.S. I’m not saying theie
weren’t hospital cases, only that they must
have been comparatively few. ihe only
bayonet wound I saw at the I rout was re-
ceived bv a captain on the first day at Dal-
lipoli. Some awkward soldier had stumbled,
and in doing so his bayonet had entered his
own officer’s thigh, making a long, ripping
o-asli. It seemed to rattle him,_ and soon he
was charging the whole Turkish Army on
his own. He was guided into a trench that
some of our fellows had taken from the
enemy, and after having his leg bound up
took over the very mixed company about him.
V brave man, lie afterwards became a colonel,
and later was killed in France.

Twentv-three years ago, in the VY oop W oops

and it was then an established term. A new
arrival and curious about native customs,
I sought the derivation of the word. it
seemed to be one of Australia’s few native
survivals of rhyming slang beloved of Cock-
nevdom in the 18th and early mh centuries,
inherited by Woolloomooloo and Colling-

“Herodot”: Some time ago a city drug-
importing firm imported from the _ Mediter-
ranean a large quantity of castor-oil. After
a good part had been distributed amongst the
retail customers the company’s analyst found
to his horror that it contained a fairly high
percentage of ricine. an extremely poisonous
bodv which is present in unrefined castor-
oil.' There was enough of this stuff in it to
kill anybody who took even a moderate-
sized dose.' Many a chemist heard his
telephone ringing that morning as if it were
a life-and-death matter, as indeed it was, and
travellers for the wholesale firm dashed
round from shop to shop as if they were pur-
sued by devils. By this exceeding prompti-
tude, plus remarkable good fortune, every
bottle of the poisonous oil was recovered
from the retailers except two, which had
been sold. In one case the purchaser was
known, and the seller got in touch with him
before he had tapped his medicine. In the
second case, the assistant who sold the
bottle could only remember that the buyer
was a little girl whose name was unknown.
But three days later she turned up again,
and artlessly announced that she had come
for another bottle, the first one having been
accidentally knocked over and broken before
the cork was drawn. Evidently the Guardian
Angel was working overtime on that par-
ticular day.

“Noiram” : “The Mug’s” description of the
Eleurbaix action as “a mad manoeuvre that
never had the slightest chance of success” (B.
5/7/’23) needs modification. After such
appalling losses it was heartbreaking to read
in the English press that “last night a suc-
cessful raid was carried out. . . .in which
Australians took part” ; still, looked at_ in
the light of after-events, there was some jus-
tification for what was published. At the
time the Hun had a large mobile reserve at
Lille, whence it could be rapidly moved by
rail to any part of the line threatened. Fro-
melles (Eleurbaix) was purely a “demon-
stration,” and it served to keep that reserve
on the Armentieres sector, and thus made
less expensive the initial stages of the Somme
offensive (1916). One Aussie battalion was
paraded in a courtyard in Bac St. Maur
(about two miles from the front line) and
told its objective. The attack was then
postponed 24 hours—that the intelligence of
the proposed attack should filter through to
the enemy, which it certainly did. The
Fritzes who counter-attacked were fresh
troops—very different from the nerve-shat-
tered wrecks who were found in the enemy
front line when we reached it. and who had
borne the brunt of our preceding barrage.
The reception accorded to a small raiding
party from an Imperial unit on our left a
few ‘nights later testified to the jumpiness of
Fritz, and adds weight to the “demonstra-
tion” theory. The sth Divvy’s losses at
Eleurbaix undoubtedly helped to foot the
bill for some of the successes further south.

"Ex-Dig.”: A man who was said to be
No. 1 among the enlistments for the M.L.
Expeditionarv Forces was let off lightly by
a Svdney Judge the other day. In this case
the leniency was warranted, for the offender
had a good military record, and his injuries
in the field rightly secured him consideration.
But nobody need run away with the idea
that low numbers always mean long-sus-
tained battle-risks. Much more often the
reverse was the case. Plenty old soldiers
who knew their way about the army and
had some knowledge of trades butted in
early to get regimental jobs as tailors or
cobblers, and duly got them. There are
men. to my knowledge, still boasting of their
low regimental numbers who did not see as
much fighting as those whose army names
had five figures attached to them.

A NEW BALLADE ON AN OLD MESALLIANCE.
[Fob The Bulletin.]
We all have heard of that wondrous thing,
How love made a monarch his heart bestow
On a beggar-maiden, and even bring
Her to the throne from the gate below ;
Her joy, her blushes, the stories show,
And how soon forgot was the gown of grey.
But, being a woman, I’d like to know
What did his mother and sisters say?
Those olden ballads the minstrels sing
The piquant parts of the tale forego;
There are no descriptions of crown and ring,
No details given of lace and bow;
The old-time Press was distinctly slow —
With our modern methods we’d know to-day,
To the very paltriest so.-and-so,
What did his mother and sisters say.
Her name was Zenelophon O’King
(She said it herself, with a curtsey low),
So she’d hair, no doubt, like a raven’s wing
And eyes of azure and cheeks aglow,
A bit of a brogue as like as no,
A ready wit and a winning way;
And she’d need it all, for “A beggar!” —oh,
What did his mother and sisters say?
Envoy.
Zenelophon, when the ghost-winds blow
Echoes out of the world of fey,
I hear you sighing, “Alas!” and “Woe!
What didn’t his mother and sisters say?”

“Bouragi” : Ever since I can remember the
gentle missionary to the heathen of the
Soutn Seas has been impressing on the trust-
ing public that he and his fellow-martyrs
have faced the bloodthirsty savage armed
with nothing more than Faith and the Word,
while the planter or trader or even the Gov-
ernment official hasn’t dared to stir abroad
without the weapons of Belial. Quite re-
cently an enthusiastic lady told a Sydney
audience that any slaying _of whites
that had been done in Papua in the early
days was the result of murderous provoca-
tion from white “miners,” and the other day
in Victoria a he-missionary declared that
most of the difficulties of the Gospel-teacher
in Papua were the result of “interference” by
the white patrol-officers. One can imagine
the distress occasioned to these worthy
people by Sydney Telegraph’s Rabaul inves-
tigator, who records with brutal frankness:
Most of the missionaries I have met, though
their beards are usually brown, can reminisce by
the hour about the “good old days” of their
early ministry, when a gun was always almost part
of. oneself. “When I came here first, in 1905,”
said one of them, “I would not have gone out to
that tank to get a drink.-of water without a loaded
rifle in mv hands.”
No doubt it’s the truth ; but it is a sad give-
away.

“Srnike”: The recent achievements in
navigation and endurance of the survivors
from the wrecked Amy Turner and Trevessa

Ocean, about 20 years ago, the ship’s life-
boat, sent for help, reached the Australian
coast after a perilous journey of 1200 miles
A few months back this run was almost
paralleled by a boat from the disabled Cana-
dian Importer, which covered over 1000
miles of ocean to San Francisco m 14 days.
For distance Bligh’s historic voyage from
the Bounty has not been approached. He
did 3GIS miles, but he was never far from
the coast, and he helped the larder by land-
ing on several islands en route. Indeed, at
the finish, he still had some of his original
provisions left.
“Ilanno”: There is a general idea that in
those islands of the Pacific where malaria is
prevalent among whites the native popula-
tions are immune. Actually the natives are
affected to a
greater degree
than Europeans,
although the dam-
age done in their
case is racial
rather than indi-
vidual. In many of
the smaller islands
the indigenous
population has been
almost wiped out
by malaria, which
produces sterilitj
in the females and
impotence in the
males. The direct
result is that each
succeeding genera-
tion is smaller
numerically than
the one before it.
In the smaller
groups of the Bis-
marck Archipelago,
from the combined
effects of malaria,
venereal disease,
tubercolosis and
skin complains, the
total extermination
of the natives is a
probability of the
very near future.
On' the other hand,
true racial iriimu-
nity to malaria,
even in its most
malignant forms, is
sometimes encoun-
tered amongst the
natives of the rnain-
1a n d of New
Guinea. This im-
munity seems to
have been conferred
upon the individual
by means of con-
stant and succes-
sive mild infections
during childhood.

“Sturt”: Judge Parsons, of S.A., has given
evidence before the Law Reform Commis-
sion, after making it clear that the Judges
agree it is “not in the public interest that
they should be examined on matters which
are matters of public comment”; hence
anything he had to say must be taken as
merely the opinion of an individual. W ltmn
that limit, he asked for a fifth Judge and
increased Supreme Court accommodation;
thought the criminal law needs consolidat-
in'’' and revising; would retain a jury in
criminal cases, though not necessarily in
civil: and had never known a case, of jury-
squaring. Also, he gave the Bar in South
Aus. a first-class “character”. —he cpuld -not
remember any instance of impropriety in
cross-examination. Which seems to suggest
that the manners of a Court are largely
governed by the manners of the community
in which it sits. Adelaide, in spite of its
growth, has remained distinctly rural, with
the Methodist conscience still strongly
leavening the lump; and a counsel who in
Svdney might establish a reputation tor
courage and smartness would m Adelaide
run the risk of being regarded as merely dis-
reputable. # *
“Xarrabundah”: How’s this for the last

that the Canberra Hospital had an extra out-

“The Deacon”: Snobbery and slavish fol-
lowing of Haw ideals were never better

And despite the winter gale that raged on the

desperately to the solar topee! #
After a visit to the Privy Council: —
Cases are heard on the floor of the House of Lords,
but there is a complete absence of ceremony. In
place of the usual Judges’ bench, an ordinary office
table, at which sits the chairman, is placed at the
end of the chamber opposite the throne. Usually
four ouier Judges sit at small tables at the ugh
and left of the chairman. The five Judges, all pee ,
constitute the full Court of Appeal. gowns or
wigs are worn, all appearing in ordinary.street dress.
Except for a constable standing outside the door
and the small army of wigged barristers who huddle
together in a box immediately in front of the chair-
man, there is nothing to indicate that the proceedings
are judicial. As a spectacle of the dignity and might
of the law, it pales into insignificance alongside many
the dizzy limit.

a magistrate’s court. No provisipn is made for spec-
tators, who cluster around the door. It was a hot
afternoon, and one sympathised a little with the
elderly Judge .whose white head drooped lower and
lower until, with a jerk, consciousness returned and
he began to write furiously. The chairman was
much more active ; during counsel’s speech he wrote,
sealed and addressed two letters. Rather a volatile
individual is Lord Birkenhead, the president, one-
time plain F. E. Smith, M.P., and barrister-at-law.
In Australia pride is taken in the fact that the
judiciaxy is kept aloof from every outside influence,
particularly politics. One cannot imagine our Chief
Justice, for example, taking the stump during an
election campaign. Yet Lord Birkenhead, Chairman
of the Judiciary Committee of the Privy Council,
on rising from the court immediately took his seat
on the party benches of the House of Lords. He
is one of the most bitter antagonists of the present
Government, and often shocks the noble peers by
his vehemence.

“Randolph Rentless” : At least one duel
lias taken place in Australasia since the
Auckland event of 1850 (B. 12/7/’23).
About 25 years ago a Sydney pressman—
still alive, but with the fire gone out of the
walking-stick he liked to use as a sword —
was: inveigled into an affair of honor _ with
a visiting foreigner of somewhat excitable
disposition. The quarrel was artfully fanned
by some Bohemian jokers over a midnight
supper, -where the wine had flowed freely;
and in the early hours of next morning cabs
conveyed the fire-eaters and their seconds to
Centennial Park, where the antagonists faced
one another with revolvers —containing no-
thing worse than blank cartridge. One ex-
change of shots was held to satisfy honor;
the principals subsequently shook hands, pro-
fessing high admiration for each other’s cour-
age ; and when the party got back to Sydney

The Stab of the period got a full and whim-
sical report from one of the jokers; but the
Sydney man still persists in regarding the
event as a dead-earnest duel.
* * * A
• “Coot’s” scrap of ancient history:—
111 the Vic. Leg. Council the President' puts up
a brief petition on conventional lines, blit the
Assembly gets to work, etc., without any such
formality. In the first session of Victoria’s first
Legislature, in 1851, Mr. Dunlop gave notice of
motion —“That public prayers to Almighty God be
offered up daily at the opening of this Council, and
that a Committee select or prepare a suitable form
of Pi’aver, to be read by the Speaker.” Thereupon
Mr (afterwards Sir) John O’Shanassy notified that,
he would move, contingent upon Mr. Dunlop’s motion
being adopted—“ That it be an instruction to
the Committee appointed to draw up a form of Prayer
to move an address, to his Excellency, praying that
he will be pleased to place a sum not exceeding
£lO,OOO on the estimates, to be placed by this
Council at the disposal of the Prayerful Committee,
to enable them to offer a premium for the best form
of Prayer submitted to them by tender, designed
especially not to interfere with the civil rights or
religious opinions or privileges of any Member of
this House, and also that it be a special instruction
of this Council that every member of the Prayerful
Committee shall, on agreeing to their Report, accom-
pany it with their letters patent of Inspiration,
and the date of their origin.” Stawell (afterwards
Chief Justice) followed with a motion “That inas-
much as the contingent notice of motion is blas-
phemous and. unparliamentary, it be expunged front
the notice paper.” After a stormy scene and some
heated exchanges, the amendment was withdrawn;
and then the original motion was defeated by one
vote.

“Cartot”: If statistics were obtainable
about the complexion of Australians, it would
certainly be found that not only is the dark
the dominant type, but that the fair-haired
child grows steadily rarer among the native-
born. Australia has been mostly populated
from the United Kingdom, which means that
the great majority of Australians had fair-
eomplexioned ancestors. Yet analyse any
crowd, and you will find many more dark
persons than fair ones. Amongst women
the pure golden blonde, common in Eng-
land and America, is becoming more and
more a rarity. Contemporaneously, the olive-
skinned and really swarthy type is becoming-
more and more frequent; and this racial
characteristic becomes more marked as one
goes north. The change, is, I suppose, due to
climatic influences ; but I doubt whether any
rule on the subject could yet be laid down.

“1.F.M.”: The recent Queensland State
scholarship exam, produced the usual crop
of “howlers.” The late Lord Northcliffe was
scheduled, amongst other things, as (1) the
editor of The Bulletin, (2) the author
of “While the Billy Boils,” and (3) “the
commander of the fleet in the Near East. ’
Of prohibition one youthful sage wrote : “I
do not know much about it, as I am not old
enough to know everything.” Our newest
industry, cotton, was described by an en-
thusiastic youth as “another gem added to
the color scheme of Queensland, a bright
star in a dark-green firmament.” Several
examinees mentioned that “a shire election
is to get men to do up the roads” : and the
most important of the qualifications for fran-
chise was summarised as “You must not be
in a madhouse or gaol.” Doomsday Book
was explained as follows:. “William I. sent
men round to find out the wealth of the
people to stop them sending in wrong income-
tax returns.” The Black Hole of Calcutta

another laid the responsibility on “Sergeant

To see a city play,
Whilst I was at the Show Ground gates.

William Fraser, for many years Massey’s
Minister for Works and one of the oldest
inhabitants of Maoriland Parliament, has
been cut off in the flower of his youth.
“Wakatipu Fraser” —he had a humpy up
among the great lakes —was the son of an
old-time Indian cavalry man, but herded
sheep on the Otago Alps until the rabbits
took charge and edged him into politics. A
little chap with white mutton-chop whiskers
and a briar pipe sticking out in front, he
soon became one of the props and stays of
the Right-thinking Party in the days o/Bal-
lance and Seddon. But he was a clean-
handed prop and stay through it all. and one
of the best-liked of the old brigade. Five
years ago William Fraser celebrated a birth-
day by having his first ride in an aeroplane,
and reckoned it the finest experience of a
not uneventful life. He Avas onlv 82 at the
finish.
In Father Sullivan, rector of Xavier Col-
lege, Melbourne, the Jesuits will acquire the
first Australian superior the Order has
known. (Father Loekington. whom he suc-
ceeds,. is a Maorilander.) Father Sullivan,
who is only 45, was born and educated in
Melbourne, but has travelled most of the
world. He is an all-round sportsman, and
is best remembered as a front-rank rowing-
man.
The Annandale Johnston family vault, on
the northern side of the Waverley (Svdnevl
REX THOMPSON,
of Thompson and
Co., the Castle-
maine ( Vic. )
machine-makers.
Cemetery is pro-
bably the oldest as
well as the most
densely occupied
vault in that city
of the dead. A
tablet records the
decease of Isabella,
an infant daughter,
aged two years, in
1.506, 117 years
ago; and only 36
years after the
landing of Captain
Cook. There was
another interment
in 18 20, and
Colonel George
Johnston returned
to dust in 1823.
The vault contains
the remains of 28
members of the
family.
Donald McLeod, who died the other day
at 85, was for 28 years the uncrowned kin<*
of Daylesford (Vic.), with the title of Town
Olerk. He abdicated at the end of last cen-
tury to become Assembly member for the dis-
trict—a job he might have had six years
before but that Wheeler (the man who sus-
pended Speight under orders from Shiels)
was a friend of his. Irvine took McLeod
into his Ministry, and Bent retained him.
He, therefore, had an unbroken run of
years. Then he had two years (1915-17)
in Peacock’s last team. Had he entered
politics 10 years earlier he would eertainly
have bagged the Premiership. A fine old
chap, who batted well in a long innings.
When it became known that Jessie Watson
Webb, M.A., was willing to be Australia’s
alternative woman delegate to the League of
Nations Assembly, all was over bar the
shouting. The only competition was repre-
sented by a couple of lady-politicians. Miss
Webb, who is now at the British School of
Archaeology at Athens, is not only brilliant
on the scholastic side (during her three years
at Melbourne University she took three suc-
cessive firsts and two scholarships) ; she is
a. woman of affairs and a convincing speaker.
Dean Matthew Horan, who went aloft
at 81 the other day at Gyinpie (Q.), where
he had been soul-saving for 55 years, was
related to Brisbane’s first Bish. (Dr.
Quinn), and three of his brothers were
priests. In the early days of Gympie young
Horan was called on to pacify an infuriated
mob who wanted
to pull down, with
a rope, the local
newspaper office
because of a semi-
humorous par.
about how easy it
was to get gold.
Unknown to the
crowd he managed
to cut the rope
halfway through,
where it was tied
round a support of
the building, and
when the order
came to pull it
was the diggers and
not the office that
came down with a
crash. Their anger
had cooled ere they
re-formed their bat-
talion, and there
were only grins
when it was
learned that the
popular young
priest had played
the trick.
SYD GARDNER,
the new National-
ist M.H.R, for
Robertson (N.S.W. ).
"Djianrats”: The late Col. “Bob” Davis
(B. 5/7/’23) was a martinet in the matter
of cleanliness. His constant reminder to the
men of the 38th, in camp at Lark Hill, was
that they should have everything superbly
polished. At an inspection one Sunday morn-
he detected a mess-tin without a lid.
“Where’s the lid?” he demanded of the re-
sponsible Digger. “Can’t find it, sir,” said
the “When did you have it
last?” asked the C. 0., beginning to bubble.
“This morning, sir, when I was shaving,”
came the reply. “What!” barked the fas-
tidious colonel—“your mess-tin lid! The
utensil which you eat your meals out of! Do
you mean to tell me that you use it as a
shaving mug?” “No, sir,” blandly remarked
Billjim, “I was using it for a mirror.” It
caught the C.O. fair in the centre of his
sense of humor. “Sergeant,” he said, “see
that this man gets a new mess-tin lid.”
Hartley Williams, ex-Supreme Court
Judge, who was passed over for the Vie.
C.J.-ship when Higinbotham died in 1902,
has been drawing his pension of £l5OO for
20 years. Madden, who was made C.J., has
been under the sod five years. McPherson
referred to the “stayers” the other day
when talking about pensions, and indicated,
among others, Williams and Black-Wednes-
dayed Byron Moore, now sec. of the V.R.C.,
who has been drawing £2BO p.a. for 451 years.
He said Vic.’s pension bill had topped the
half-million by £9OOO, and he wasn’t sure
the peak had been reached yet. The average,
however, is only a trifle over £l6O a pen-
sioner.
James Hebbard, the manager who has the
job of fighting a fire in the Central mine at
Broken Hill, knows how to do it probably
as well as any man living. He was hardly
more than a youngster when he left Bendigo
and became manager of the Junction at
Broken Hill, 35 years ago. Later, the Mines
Department not then having a man who had
experience in big-lode mines, he was engaged
as inspector on the Barrier, and chiefly
because he had specialised in “safe” mining
the Sulphide Corporation presently grabbed
him, and he has directed its work
for nearly 30 years. The great difficulty
about all these fires in Broken Hill mines is
that they can’t be safely approached: the
effect of the pyroligneous gas is just the
same as that of charcoal fumes in a closed
room. The B. H. P'rop. found that the only
thing to do was to wall-in the area; and one
such charcoal heap smouldered for over 10
years. Certainly they don’t use such a forest
of Oregon now as they did in those days.
There are more things in Philosophy than
are dreamt of in heaven and earth, Horatio.
Elizabeth Jackson, philosophy lecturer at
Adelaide ’Varsity and a light essayist in her
leisure moments, who died young and much
regretted, left a small sum to provide that
London Punch shall appear in the students’
club-room for ever!
A row between Brothers of the Wig seems
to have started in Queensland. Under the
new divorce law Lukin, J., lately heard in
camera a case in which the parties were
prominent people. Answering a similar
application, based on the ground that “per-
sons of standing would be affected,” Mac-
naughton, J., peremptorily refused, adding:
‘Otherwise there would be possibly class dis-
tinctions, under which wealthy people would
secure the hearing of their cases in camera
and poor people would not.” The subsequent
proceedings in the Judges’ chambers haven’t
been reported, but there must have been
some sparks flying, and since then Mac-
naughton has been busy explaining that what
he said was not what he did say, or some-
thing to that effect.
“Platman’s” picture of some Ministers :
It is the fashion to say that Theodore won
the Queensland election by his forceful personality
etc.; but exactly the same thing was said of the late
T. J. Ryan when he led the party—-“ Take Ryan away
and the Labor party will go to pieces.” Ryan went
into Federal politics and Theodore took his place;
and should Theodore go into the Federal Parliament
there are others to take his place. Gillies has been
elected Deputy Leader practically unanimously. Per-
haps he is not so forceful as Theodore, but he is
an easier man to like, and there is no doubt he is
keen on the farmer, a fact of great importance. Then
there is StopfQid, probably the best speaker of them
all, and gifted with a sense of humor which endears
him to every audience. He has got full Cabinet
rank now as Home Secretary. As a youngster he
Was at Mt. Morgan, when the chlorine gas and dry
crushing process ate the lungs, and his fight for the
inclusion of industrial diseases in the : Workers’
Compensation Act pushed him into the public
eye. Mullan is one of the last of the old
hands of 20 years ago, and full of discretion;
As a layman he has held the position of Attorney-
General, and made fewer blunders than might have
been expected. Last but not least is “Big Bill”
McCormack, the shrewdest and quickest thinker of
them all. For health reasons—he had a bad heart
attack a few months ago—he has been going easy;
still it is rare that Theodore makes an important
move without a heart-to-heart talk with his old
cobber. They met in Irvinebank in 1907, and to-
gether organised the A.W.U. thereabouts.
J* H. Maiden, about to retire from his
30-year-old job as curator of Sydney Botanic
Gardens, was previously in charge of the
old Technological Museum in the Domain. It
was the quest for health that brought him
to Australia originally. Being an enthusiast
he is likely to relinquish set duties only to be-
come a freelance in well-doing—like Peter
Board, the late Director of Education, and
A. W. Green, who was head of the State
Children’s Department.
“Sucre” ; “Jack” McMaster, Brisbane’s
G.0.M., has iust turned his 03rd page. For
68 years up there he has been variously store-
keeper, alderman, mayor and politician. His
forest of grey whiskers, surmounted by a
Saharan upper lip, earned him the sobriquet
of ‘Oom Paul” ; but he is about the most
respected Caledonian in the city. In the
early days he established a line of horse
buses, and made money by them until
Badger hung wires over the streets to feed
his electric trams.
Maoriland’s wonder woman, the Rev.
Mother Mary Aubert, was 88 the other day.
A quarter of a century ago she and a little
company of four Sisters of the Order of
Compassion went to Wellington from the
Orphanage at Jerusalem, on the Wanganui
River fshe had founded it several years pre-
viously), to start the Home of Compassion
m the city. Half-a-crown and unlimited faith
were their only assets, but they took to
their care the poor, the helpless and the out-
cast, and, curiously enough, as their charges
grew in numbers so did their loaves and
fishes To-day a great pile of buildings hous-
ing homeless and mentally or physically
afflicted children and a number of old women
is their monument. Some years ago, when
she was in her seventies, Mother Aubert
called on the Pope and got a special charter
for her Order. While she was in Italy the
great earthquake at. Messina took place, and
in the very centre of the relief and care
of the injured was the Mother. She was also
m Italy during the war, and despite her 80-
odd years took a hand at nursing.
“Pantagruel”: Within a couple of months
Death has wiped out. the three oldest mem-
bers of the most ancient drapery firm in Cen-
tral and Western Bananaland—James
Stewart and Co. James Stewart, well over
80, was the first to go; then J. S. Steel, his
nephew ; last, It. Macfarlane, his brother-in-
law, aged 73. They were all stern old Scots,
and straight as a die. The last-named was for
many years a member of the Rockhampton
Harbor Board and Chamber of Commerce,
and chairman of the Blair Athol Coal Co.
“Skyrider” : Signed his last probate notice
at 00, Albert Kd ward Send all, junior part-
ner in Goulburn’s
best-known law firm.
He was a leading
Anglican, president
of the Goulburn
Club and an ardent
amateur astrono-
mer. During the
war he raised
thousands for the
Diggers, and, un-
like so many
others, didn’t for-
get them when
they came back.
He was a son of
the late H. J. Sen-
dall, of the Bank
of N. S. Wales;
and there’s a son
who is learning
how to trap Costs.
GEORGE GIFFEN,
the ex-champion
cricketer.
“Cinquante Neuvi&me”: There went west
the other day at the Lake Tyers (Vic.) Abo-
riginal Station, William Thorpe, one of the
few abos. to take to agriculture seriously.
For years he and his~ family farmed a selec-
tion, and it was only recently, when he was
too old to work, that he took his wife
and youngsters back to the station. His
eldest son was killed in action after winning
the M.M.
Dr. Jervois Aarons, a well-known gynaeco-
logist, _of Harley-street, who died on the
operating table of a London hospital recently,
began to earn his keep in a Sydney ware-*
house._ His father, Lew Aarons, dabbled
in minjing on the Stock Exchange and
gathered the musical and theatrical folk of
Sydney to his Randwick home in the
’nineties. A brother, Frank, did well as a
lawyer in the Cold Country, but he, too.
died young.
Passed out at 72, Richard James Joseph
Ryan, a Bathurst (N.S.W.) native, who
for a long time chased Costs in Dubbo. He
was a big man in his day, and in his office
W. P. Crick first studied law and politics.
<*J. P. Jones, leader for Labor in the Vic.
Tippah Chambah, has been made a member
of the ’Varsity Council by the Lawson
Government. A successful tailor, he is,
mentally, one of the best equipped men in
the State’s Parliament, and will be no pas-
senger on the council.
“Huffin Guffin”: Yes, fine old Bishop
Langley still does his bit (B. 28/6/’23).
A parishioner of St. Hilary’s (East Kew,
Melb.) wrote about the veteran this way
the other day :
. Bishop Bangley preached at, St. Hilary’s this morn-
ing-, (June 24). He is in his 89th year, but is still
quite active, and preaches very well. It is rather
impressive to think of a bishop moving in a city of
840,000 inhabitants that had no existence when he
was born. He lives next door to St, Hilary’s, and
usually sits in the congregation when not occupying
the pulpit.
If R. McK. Oakley goes with Bruce to
London, his understudy, G. E. Hudson, will
double his roles of Chairman of the Tariff
Board and Comptroller-General of Customs.
Hudson is one of the rising stars of the ser-
vice. Originally a clerk with Burns, Philp
and Co., in Sydney, he shot into the Customs
in 1891, specialising in tariff work, became
an investigator and then Chief Surveyor in
Melbourne. A return to the Harborside as
N.S.VV. Controller preceded his advance last
year to Vic. Controller, which job he evacu-
ated for the snug chair of Deputy Controller-
General on the death of Percy Whitton.
“10-2-4’s” pen-portrait:—
H. J. Mitchell, of the Hotel Australia, the latest
public character to repudiate Sydney Artists’ Ball, is
one of the best-known men in the hotel line in the
Empire. He has been at the Castlereagh-street cara-
vanserai for over 30 years; and during that time; has
met practically everyone of note who has visited Aus-
tralia or made a social mark there. A small, grave,
snub-nosed man, Mitchell is the antithesis of the
continental major-domo. “He is the most typically
Australian product I met in Sydney,’’ said Gilbert
Frankau, who considered him one of the best restau-
rant staff-officers in the world. Lord Dudley, who,
like Frankau, had seen much of hotel life, thought
the same, with the reservation that, While priceless
in Sydney, Mitchell would not do anywhere else—he
has never cultivated the sweeping, suavity of the Lon-
don or Parisian maitre d’hotel. His other quality is
discretion. He has had more scandals forced on
his reluctant notice than all Sydney’s family solicitors
put together, but during a quarter of a century has
remained as blandly silent as one of his own oysters.
THE BALLADE OF THE CHEATED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In some backwater's sluggish flow
Where shabby folk and failures hide,
The soft, the scrupulous, the slow
With all their disappointment bide,
Aloof, forlorn, unsatisfied,
Foredoomed associates of dismay,
For Fate has set no star to guide
The dogs who never had their day.
Still at a loss through life they go,
To them all whispering hopes have lied ;
Something, but what they do not know,
Has ever checked their fortunes’ tide:
Not theirs to know achievement’s pride
Nor with strong hands some hazards sway—
Black Care keeps ever close beside
The dogs who never had their day.
They murmur not though Fate’s their foe:
The lips that have so often sighed
Lack words to formulate their woe;
Though opportunities deride
And Good Luck ever step aside,
Still, of some chimera the prey,
Follow illusion, eager-eyed,
The dogs who never had their day.
Envoy.
But, Death, your treasury is wide,
Maybe your generous hand will pay
The recompense that Life denied
The dogs who never had their day.
VICTORIA.

“Wamimbucca” : Do young rabbits die
in their burrows in droughty seasons, or does
Bunny refrain from reproducing his species under
unfavorable conditions? In the north-western dis-
tricts of N.S.W. “kittens” have not been seen since
the recent drought set in, and. trappers and bush-
men say that rabbits do not breed when herbage is
scarce. The female may be instinctively reluctant
to mate when there are no milk-producing grasses to
enable her to rear her young; but it is highly im-
probable that the party of the second part would
see eye to eye with her. Mating no doubt does go
on in drought seasons, and it may be that under
some law of nature conception does not follow.
Perhaps some other Abo. writer can throw light on
the delicate subject.

"Ringer”: Talking of strenuous rides,
how- about this for an endurance test, for both man
and beast? Joe Hagen climbed on to his horse at
Hergott Springs (S.A.), and four days later ambled
into Birdsville (Q.). Distance, 300 miles. The
prad looked fit enough to start on the return trip.

“FY7”: “Booyong’s” reference (B.
21/6/’23) to catching ducks with a fishing-net is
a reminder that this w r as once practised by that
mighty hunter, Binghi. As a kid I have seen the
game played in the Burnett (Q.) country, where
there are many wooded creeks. The beautiful nets
of kurrajong bark were stretched well above the
water, from tree to tree on either bank. Some of
the women and youngsters would go upstream to
start the drive, w'hile the men remained hidden
100yds. or so above the nets. When the ducks
came down, about tree-top level, a flight of boomer-
angs would circle over them, and the flock as one
bird would dive from the supposed hawks. Bags
were unbelievably big, and if several consecutive
nets were used few birds would get away.
“T.Y.T.”: “M.H.” (B. 14/6/’23) is cor-
rect in saying that bullocks can be steered without
blasphemy. One of the most expert oxologists I
know pilots a team of 16 in the ranges at the
back of Nar-nar-goon, Gippsland (Vic.), and he has
never been kno vn to utter an obscene w-ord —or any
other kind of word, for that matter, as he has been
deaf and dumb from infancy. The most eloquent
of all the bullockies from Paktenham to Warrigal,
freely gives pride of place to “Dummy” Collins
when it comes to negotiating a bit of difficult hill
country with a big load of timber up.
# ♦ ♦ •
“Monaro”: “Brobdiugnag’s” ad., “Eight
bullocks, first-class milking team,” (B. 14/6/’23)
reminds me of a Queensland bullocky who, starting
with 10 steers, bred 142 calves in two years. The
Judge was astonished, but managed to say five years
just the same.
* * * *
“The Rumpus”: “Pick” on the eloquence
of the Bush (B. 14/6/’23) reminds me that The
Bulletin published a par of mine concerning calf-
talk about 24 years ago. I said that when a cow
turned out into a bush paddock calves and hides her
offspring, it takes days and days of searching to
discover the “sookie.” The mother is easily found,
gnd shows you only a
bland face when you
charge her with conceal-
ment of birth. A sure
method, I said, was to
“plant” yourself where
you could see the cow,
and then imitate the plain-
tive “baa-a-a” of a very
young calf. Three doses of
this would be sufficient to
arouse the mother-instinct,
and mum would make a
bee-line for the baby.
Well, my well-meaning
effort was “baa-a-a-ed”
from all points of the
Australian compass. Never-
tludess, since then, I have
found dozens of calves by
this . method, and even hor-
ses I have located in rough
range country by simply
giving vent to that ecstatic
whinny of theirs. But as
a kid my greatest feat was
with a burly bull. Tramp-
ing alone through virgin
country in Bananaland, I
came upon a mob of cows
with a gentleman among
them, and I foolishly imi-
tated the low, aggressive
rumble, followed by the
short, sharp falsetto bel-
-1o w of a challenging
bull. He treed me quick
and lively, and knocked
big lumps of bark off
the trunk while I tormen-
ted him w-ith bull remarks
about his fighting capabili-
ties. When I’d had enough
I gave a couple of calf
“baa-a-a’s,” and he tossed
his head in disgust and rejoined his harem.

“Birre Gurra”: An Abowriter a while
back described how a. carpet-snake, interrupted in
its meal, backed off a wallaby which it was in course
of swallowing. This fractured some of long-held
beliefs concerning the one-way arrangement of a
snake’s throat; and now the curator of the Brisbane
Museum has dissipated them entirely. He put a
live death-adder in the same compartment as a
particularly devilish black snake. Next morning the
adder was missing. In a day or so the black rep-
tile, evidently discovering that the adder was not
such a tasty snack as he had anticipated, vomited
the partly-digested adder from his innards. Borne
time later he repeated the act. with a green snake.
CAP’N UNDERSTOOD.
CAP'N: “ Did that last hole you fired turr [tear], boay?”
MINER: "Well, Cap’n, she turred, and she never tarred , and yet
she did turr if you can onnerstand me."
‘Booyong”: Tell “Pat Bushie” (B.
7/6/’23) that no platypus was guilty of the death of
his two hens. The plat, he caught in the trap never
got out from underneath the box, for the simple
reason that it never got in. A platypus has nothing
in its outfit with which it could puncture the hole
in the hen’s neck, unless it be the spur on the hind
leg of the male—and he does not use that for killing
fowls. I’ve shot lots of plats., and when skinning
them have often inspected their pantries, and found
their food consisted invariably of earth-worms, shrimps
and small shellfish. The small puncture in the hen's
neck found by Patrick in his post-mortem points to
the work of the little spotted native cat, which was
plentiful on the Northern Rivers (N.S.W.) years ago.
* * * »
“Jimmy Possum”: Recent pars, about
people with miniature zoos, in their innards remind
me of a sleeper-carter on the Blackall Range (Q.),
who pulled up one day and asked me for a drink.
Handing him the billy, which I had just returned
from filling at a gully half-a-mile away, I watched
him anxiously as he broke his drought. He w-aja
a ginger-bearded, cross-eyed, cheerful sort of a
cuss, who rolled his r’s badly, and as he gulped he
looked hard over the point of his nose into the
billy, the fixity of his stare and his cross-eye giving
him a most comical expression. ‘‘Looking to see
how much to drink?” I grinned, when at last he
handed back the billy. “No,” he said, thickly—-
“lookin’ for bally fwrogs. Don’t want the blanks
dwrinkin’ all my flamin’ beer when I go to th'
pub ter-night.” And then he spat out —a couple of
small bullyfrogs. All the gullies there were teem-
ing with tadpoles, and it was next to impossible
to dip a billy of water without baling out a few.
“Pick”: An incident of
years ago when we were droving
Bibbenluke (N.S.W.) bullocks to
the Goulburn market, leads me
to suspect similar circumstances
in the case of “Yarra Bank's”
singularly domestic brolga (B.
21/6/’23). We were on watch by
Gungoandra, when the dogs rushed
a curlew that, appeared in the
campfire light. We cursed the
mongs. off, and Longlegs thank-
fully sheltered among us. He
sampled the tucker bags, tore
into the damper and beef, then
preened himself contentedly by
the log fire and dossed for the
night on a pack saddle. When we
moved on in the morning, by
running and short flights he
accompanied the pack-horses for
miles, and it was after mid-day
when finally he planed off on a
long flight back. A week later,
while fraternising with a road
contractor’s gang at Lake Bath-
urst, we learned that they had
left Bob, their tame curlew, at
their former camp near Gun-
goandra.
“FY7”: “Jim Dandy” (B. 28/6/’23> is
mystified because he couldn’t find a heart in a
rooster which he post-mortemed. I timidly offer
the suggestion that the bird’s heart was in his moutii
when he saw the assassin lift the tomahawk, and
so was cut off with his head. If not too late, I’d
advise “J.D.” to retrieve that head and investigate.
“Billy Brolga”: I
agree with “Keystring”
that Warrigal has real
brains (B. 17/5/’23);
but I don’t think it
was altogether intelli-
gence which induced
Mrs. Warrigal to hide
her babies in his old
shed. The dingo is a
true clog, and as such
has an instinctive long-
ing for the companion-
ship of man, though
a very natural fear
prevents him giving
way to it. Riding and
walking i n lonely
localities in the bush,
1 have been followed
for hours by a soli-
tary howler, and I re-
member a big red-
yellow chap who took
up a position about
jOyds. aw a y from
where my brother and
1 were working one
day, and kept us com-
pany till late in the
evening. If we tried
t o approach, he’d
slowly retreat. A s
soon as we went back
to work he’d return,
and, making himself
comfortable again,
would go oil catching-
flies and scratching
himself unconcernedly
as before. This inher-
ent longing for the
companionship of man
has given rise to many
silly stories of the hos-
tility of dingoes.
“Lofty”: Recent pars, about fluke shots
remind me that when a small boy 1 fired at a
rabbit w-ith a pea-rifle, my youngest sister—an
interested spectator—standing half-left from me
about 250 yards away and practically at right angles
to the line between me and bunny. I missed, and
the bullet apparently “ricked” from a stone and
penetrated a piece of cardboard with which little
sister was shielding her head from the sun. Her
ladyship has the aforesaid bit of card in her glory
box to day as a souvenir.

“Centre’s” mixed foursome:—
A sparrow courtship was in progress on the root'
ot‘ the garage, just below the house, when “the
triangle of trouble” was formed by the arrival of
a second male bird. Number One wasted no time
m expostulation, but went for the Nark with beak,
wings and claws. The lady watched the scrap, hop-
ping to the edge of the guttering when her two
admirers went over, still in grips, and landed on
the paved yard below. The two males seemed to
have their beaks locked together, and with tlieir
claws were making the feathers fly as they rolled
over and over. The scrap was still going strong
when a third buck came along, took in the situation
at a glance and swaggered up to the lady. She
evidently thought his suggestion that he was better
than either of the battered gents, below worth
consideration, and flew off with him. The two in
the yard were weakening fast, and it wasn’t long
before one rolled over and fluttered awav from the
other. That other gave one little heave of his

shoulders and handed in his marble —dead. The
winner of the scrap, after two attempts, managed
to reach the edge of the guttering; but. coming on
top of his battle-wounds, the shock of finding the
lady had gone was too much for him, and ho fell
dead in the gutter. The one in the vard I found
had got his marching orders through' the beak of
the other reaching his little brain by way of the eye-
socket.
THE RED HAGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Red Hags rest while the plains are green
And the grass is waving high,
When the Sturt-pea spreads like a patch of blood
On the sandhills where they lie.
Full fleeced and prime are the shepherds’ flocks
When the rain falls in the west;
But bones gleam white in the grass at night
While the red hags lie at rest.
Sound and deep is the red hags’ sleep
Till the claypans dry and bake.
When the sand piles high and the creeks go dry
It is then that the red hags wake,
And lurk by the banks of the dried-up tanks
Or follow the waterless creeks.
They revel in mud and gorge on blood,
And follow a man for weeks.
And wild is the dance of the three red hags
When the sky has never a clopd.
And overhead there’s a cloak of red,
Where the dust hangs like a shroud.
They dance to the scream of a soul that's damned,
That is heard when the wind is high,
I'hen seek their prey where the lost men stray
Like the vultures of the sky.
They wail and croak in a mad man’s ear
And they’ll strike at a sick man’s throat:
if he cries in pain they will strike again
And cackle and taunt and gloat.
They’ll prow-1 and peer when the end is near,
Be it horrors or death from thirst;
The crows may rest on a dead man’s chest,
But the red hags get in first.
He will strip his body and wasted limbs
Till all but the feet are bare,
And rave of the days that have long gone past
As he lies in the burning glare;
And a red hag points with a bony claw-
To river or spring or well
By spreading shades in phantom glades
On the track that leads to Hell.
ANXIOUS TO OBLIGE.
CUSTOMER (sorry for overloaded errand-boy): “ Goodness , butcher ,
haven’t you any bowels of compassion?”
BUTHER: "No. mem: but I ’are some lovely fresh tripe.”
Grim is the land of the three red hags
As they stalk by the Drought King’s side;
For one is Hunger and one is Thirst,
And they follow him far and wide.
And close at hand in the burning sand,
In the track of the hot wind’s breath,
She follows last, where the rest have past;
For the third red hag is Death.

“N’lmporte”: I also can beat “Orion’s”
lady grafters (B. 21/6/’23) with four who toiled as
much for love as necessity. At Myers Flat, near
Eaglehawk (Vic.), a pair of sisters handled a double-
furrow ordinary plough with the ease of a birth-
right. Besides yoking Dobbin for a journey into the
hush to cut and load their own firewood, they
grubbed, sowed, reaped, carted their crop, milked,
and, by way of relief from their labors, attended to
their housework. Half-a-mile up the road lived an
American negress married to a Dago, who was in
work himself. She was a familiar figure hawking
hoiisewood, after having gone some miles into the
bush to cut and load it. Yet another woman near
Eaglehawk reared her children by mastering the
technique of a puddling tub. She could sink shallow
holes for wash-dirt with the best of the men?
THE SAFETY LIMIT.
“Been helping with the milking, dear? That's
right. When in Rome do as Rome
does."
'“Yes, hut for goodness sake don't, you go
trying to ride any horses.”
“Lofty”: “Pick” (B. 28/G/’23) says that
in the memory of the oldest inhabitants Lake
■George (N.S.W.) has never been full. It was full
in ’9l. While assuming that the subterranean river
theory is bunkum, I argue that the lake has only
developed the nasty habit of going dry within com-
paratively recent years. My father sailed a small

yacht on it for some years, including the early
'nineties, and one Glover had a steam launch about
the same time—and neither complained of the lack
of the necessary moisture on which to navigate their
Dreadnoughts. Official records show that the first
annual lease of part of the bed was granted on
l/12/”02>; so it’s safe to assume that the lake hadn’t
developed its habit of emptiness much before that
date. In the ’nineties it teemed with cod; some
weighed up to 801 b., and it would take more than
a few years for such old men to develop. When
the pool did go dry it advertised where it used to
be by the stink of rotting fish that stranded in
thousands. It is fairly evident, by the way, that at
one time the lake extended in a southerly direction
from its modern shores at least 20 miles —fossilised
fish have been found in the hills nearly that distance
from its present location —and that eventually it
broke through the range on its ancient western
shore, the result being the Molonglo River, the
stream that is supposed (by the grace of God) to
supply water for the artificial lakes at Canberra.
* * * *
“Oohsed”: “Geebung” (B. 24/5/’23) is a
long way out in his equine old-age record. The world’s
record, according to “Brown’s Modern Farriery,’
goes to a horse that lived to the full age of 1 6
years. The skeleton is now in a British museum
(Birmingham, if I remember correctly). In the book
mentioned there is a plate showing the horse's teeth
as they appeared at his death.
* * * *
“Bogan Bill” : We were yarning round the
fire before turning in, when a small, meek-looking
man approached and politely asked if we would allow
him to camp with us. He settled down on his
olankets and appeared to take no notice of us, and
we had been swapping lies for quite a while before
he interrupted. “1 know of a peculiar happening
which might interest you gentlemen,” he said in a
dull brown voice. “Some years ago the 12-year-old
daughter of (a well-known farmer who' lived
about 50 miles away) was badly scared by a tiger-
snake, which fastened on to her dress, but didn't
bite her. The shock was so great that she was in
bed for nearly six months, and during that time she
completely lost her skin. Ever since then, regularly
. once a year, about the time she received the shock,
she sheds her skin like a shake. The whole business
takes her about three weeks, and while it’s going on
she has the temper of a fiend out of Hades.” The
stranger paused, and stared into the fire; but when
we made no comment he continued, “mat’s why
I’m here, gentlemen. I married her.”
“Kenbir” (Kendall Expedition) : Have
any of the Abo. Council resident in the North ever
heard the natives talk of the “little fella pussy-
cat with big fella stink that walkabout longa scrub”?
Many and varied are the reports concerning it, but
on information given by a white prospector who
saw one and described it as being the size of a
native-cat but with black and white stripes, Kendall,
of the Zoological Expedition to N.Q., believes it to
be a variety of the American skunk, and has addea
it to his list of intended captures.
“N’lmporte”: The only assistance I can
offer “Wai-ite” in his search (B. 21/6/’23) for a
480 ft. gum-tree is to tell him that some years ago
one stretched its lordly neck to a height of 430 ft. at
Fernshaw (Vic.). If the wood-fiends have not inter-
fered with it it should be over 450 ft, now. Anyway,
a London paper at the time had this to say about it:
The sequoia-trees in the Mariposa Valley (U.S.A.)
had for long been regarded as the biggest in the
world; but there has now been discovered at Fern-
shaw, in the Dandenong district of Vic., a specimen
of the almond-leaved gum ( Eucalyptus amygdalina)
which proves to be 430 ft. high and 60ft. in girth.
This Australian giant throws off its first branch
380 ft. from the ground. If the tree were planted
in St. Paul’s Churchyard its summit would overtop
the cross of the cathedral by 26ft.

“Ooragnak”: “Boori” (B. 24/5/’23)
might be told that sea-mullet live in the sea and not
in the rivers. They do not “forsake their upstream
homes and migrate to the sea to spawn” and “make
a fatal mistake by dallying in the shallow estu-
aries.” They come from the sea into the shallow and
quiet waters of the river mouths to spawn. By so
doing they escape to a great extent their voracious
foes of the ocean. They come in millions so closely
packed that they may be taken by drawing a line,
with several naked hooks attached, through them.
This procession continuing day and night, it fol-
lows that mankind secures a very small proportion
of them. The roe of each fish contains some hun-
dreds of thousands of minute eggs. The Fisheries
Department or somebody, instead of prohibiting
the catching of sea-mullet, should induce our
cokstal people to snare as many as possible, after
spawning if practicable, and send them to the fish-
hungry inhabitants of our inland towns. Salted and
dried few fish cane beat them. They are a long
way superior to much of the imported dried fish,
which in dietetic value is about equal to stringy -
bark saturated with brine.
* * * *
“Monaro”: Brummy’s £lBO shout (“D.F.,”
B. 7 /6/’23) was eclipsed by a station-worker out
Tambo way (W.Q.). On winning Tatt’s he bought the
contents of the three local hotels ( £450) and asked
the inhabitants to give it a name. This they did as
long as they were able. Thereafter they pointed. When
the drought again settled down the town had to
wire to Brisbane to ask the date.
* » * *
“Jimmy Longun” : “Spinifex” is only rat-
tling when he talks of skinning an old-man ’roo in
a minute (B. 24/5/’23). No doubt he really thinks
he can peel an old man in five minutes at a loaf-
ing pace; but that’s probably because he’s so dashed
pleased when he knocks one that it stems to take
him only that long. You can tear the hide off a
wallaby, a joey ’roo and even a half-grown kangaroo
in a couple of minutes if you hustle; but with a real
old-man it’s a different tale. Some of the old
beggars are hide-bound, and you could no more drag
off their jackets in the usual way than draw a
bullock-waggon out of a bog with a jibbing billy-
goat. Anyway, my argument was not on record
stunts, but the time occupied by the average shooter
in stripping an old-man at the usual working-pace.
And I didn’t say only 10 ’roos could be skinned in
a day. What I said was that an average of 10 pelts
a day (300 a month) was about the limit for one
shooter.
*** • *
“Jimmy Possum”: “Spenner” says (B.
17/5/’23) a cocky at Mumbannar (Vic.) has
been milking a cow continuously for nine years.
That’s nothing. My ole woman has been milking one
for 40 years. P.S.: The cow’s me. —J.P. PP.S.:
This ’d be true, only I ain’t got no ole woman, an'
I ain’t 40 neither. I’m only 39 and three-quarters.
But there’s lots of blokes’ll see the point. Bes’
respec’s.—J.P.
* - * * *
“H.G.K.”: “Kenbir’s” par. (B. 7/6/’23)
re three little kangaroos in one pouch makes me
smile. Out from Derby (W.A.), in potting some
5000-odd ’roos, T discovered this “not unusual hap-
pening,” and that once only. Jack Skipworth, then
’rooing on the Fitzroy—he has died there since—
assured me that during his 40 years’ hunting of the
’roo he had not seen or heard of such a thing. I
have mentioned the fact to many old hunters, but
received no confirmation of this “not unusual hap-
pening” until I read “W.D.G.’s” par. (B. 26/4/’23).
“Kenbir’s” orphan theory is disproved (in this in-
stance, at any rate) by the fact that neither of
the three joeys were off the teat or able to eat
grass.
• • • *
“Zanthus” : Most imported pests, such as
the rabbit and the sparrow, have been first intro-
duced to the eastern parts of Australia and
have spread westward. The rabbit has got right
across, and the sparrow is well on the way. The
reverse is happening with the “stick-tight flea”
of poultry ( Echidnophaga gallinaceaj . Dr. E. W.
Ferguson points out that this jumper, originally
described from Ceylon, has become a pest on
poultry in Westralia, where its existence was first
reported in 1914. It also attacks dogs, horses,
rats, and even man. It is spreading eastward, and
specimens have been taken from rabbits at Eucla
and from a dog and a child at Obldea, on the
East-West line.
* * * »
An argumentative volley :
“Nugget”: I’d like to have a look at that dingo-
skin of “Firestick’s” (B. 14/6/’23) if it really did
stop six .22 Winchester bullets at 75yds, I have
used a similar weapon on destructive dogs at double
that range, and never had a failure. Once I loaned
the same rifle—a .22 Remington—to a drover when
one of his mob went mad. He settled the beast with
one shot fired from at least 60yds. If “Firestiek”
tries shooting his dingoes in the head or shoulders he
may have better results, especially if the barrel of
his rifle isn’t choked up with lead. By the way, how
did he manage to keep that dingo quiet at such a
short range while he pumped him full of ineffective
bullets?
“Nitric”: As “Firestiek” says, the .22 is not trust-
worthy on a big animal like a ’roo after the first
100yds. I’ve picked many a wallaby off '-.with a .22,
but only by head-shooting or firing low for the hip.
Most Western men prefer the .32 for the ’roo, though
many favor a .44. But give me the .38 ; she’s not
heavy to pack, and theres all the kick there up lo
700yds. Keep the .22 for water-raits.
“Bayard”: I agree with “Primer” (B. 10/5/’23)
in all he says about the .22 rifle. I have shot an
old-man wombat with it, and if any hide, bat ele-
PRIME BACON.
“That old sick vow o' mine pot down last
night, and the damn pigs ate 'er."
“ Well. you'll he able to sell some real dairy-
fed pork for once in your life."
phant or rhinoceros, is tougher, then I’ll eat my hat.
I fired only one shot, from a long black-powder cart-
ridge, and the distance was 70-odd yards. The bullet
hit above the left ear, and was found sticking in the
right side of the neck. If “Firestiek” put six shots
into a dingo without damaging him seriously, he
must have been using short smokeless cartridges,
and the rifle must 'have been badly cut about the
rifling.
“Yamminon”: I prefer a .32-40 myself—there is
less accuracy required—but I have used a .22 a good
deal, and have shot ’roos up to 130yds. with it. And
I’ve killed an old boar with one shot at slightly over
100yds., side on. His hide was nearly two inches
thick. What’s wrong with that for penetration? My
experience was somewhat similar to “Firestick’s”
when using .22 long smokeless cartridges. I fired
15 shots at a boar that the dogs had bailed up—and
the tusker merely shook his head! Yet, using .22 ex-
long black-powder cartridges, I rarely had to fire a
second shot at a bailed-up pig. Most repeaters won't
take .22 extra-long cartridges, so I advise “Firestiek”
to swap his for a single shot, and I’ll guarantee the
.22 extra-long to stop a dingo at a greater range
than 75 yards, if “F.” has the necessary skill to hit
the brain or the heart of the animal.
PENANCE AT PIKER'S
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Golden Girl at Piker’s Pub was hard as frosted
steel,
She never blushed, compassion was beyond her
power to feel.
She laughed, or sneered with biting words, at love
and faith; indeed,
The lambing down of cheque-men formed the basis
of her creed.
Her eyes were blue as skies are blue, but in their
luring lights
Were more than hints of perfidy, and fierce inherent
spites.
And bitter insults she would fling at those who
sought her hand,
And motherhood was something she could never
understand.
Her shapely arms were gently strong to nurse a
crooning child
Or tend the chairs and tables in a cottage unde-
filed;
But at the mention of a babe again would come
her sneer:
“I'm far away from Babvland,” she’d say, “while
I am here!”
She knew the poets, and could thrill the yellowed
ivory keys,
And wake within the down-and-outs mixed, maudlin
memories.
Her thrilling touch and wheedling voice were only
used to cause
Some doped or drunken wanderer to pay her cash
applause.
One day there called at Piker’s Pub a drover tall
and tanned,
Loose-limbed as well —but oh! a Christ of Back
o’ Sunset Land.
The Golden Girl made love to him —ah ! fierce her
fond desire!
Her thoughts when she his presence felt were
thoughts that burnt like fire.
He did not shrink from her whose smiles were meant
to swiftly sway;
He simply said: “God help you, dear”.... and then
he rode away.
That night the Golden Girl walked out amidst the
ghostly scrub,
And knelt and wept—-and cursed the day she came
to Piker’s Pub !

TO say that a business that had its birth in an unpretentious shop should, within

much like a romance. There is, however, nothing in the nature of romance
about the phenomenal expansion of Holden’s Motor Body Builders’ Limited.
Of course, there are many cogent reasons to account for the present modern
and substantial structure in Adelaide housing a bewildering array of last-word labor-
saving machinery. I say "present” because the huge premises, with a floor space of
something like 44 acres on valuable land in King William Street South, are quite
inadequate to accommodate the quantity of plant absolutely necessary for the fulfilment
of existing demands. But the reason! First and foremost, it is indisputably demonstrated
that tireless energy and vigorous application of exceptional brain power are the driving
and controlling forces of this wonderful business. Other important factors which have
played a tremendous part in the fortunes of the firm have been the foresight of its
Directors and their unswerving policy. Incorporated in the latter have been a rigid
adherence to scrupulous accuracy in the minutest detail; an absolute prohibition of any-
thing but first-class material; the finest workmanship, and an unalterable insistence that
the superiority of their products should be unquestioned. Add to this the fact that the
whole of the vast works have been standardised and specialised in every conceivable
direction, and it is. unnecessary to search for further reasons to account for the firm’s
rapid expansion and the high appreciation in which their products are held throughout
the Commonwealth. The immensity of the output; the 1300 men and the day-to-day
struggle to cope with the volume of orders, is sufficient indication that Holden’s Motor
Body Builders’ Limited have successfully specialised in standardisation.
EARLY HISTORY.
The name Holden is surrounded by a period of early history. In 1856 Mr. J. A. Holden,
father of Mr. 11. J. Holden (Chairman of Directors of Holden’s Motor Body Builders’Limited),
established a saddlery and leather business at the corner of Bundle and King William Streets,
Adelaide. Subsequently it was removed to larger premises in Bindley Street, and about
45 years ago to Grenfell Street. On the death of his father, Mr. H. J. Holden continued
to carry on the business, but in 1885 Mr. H. A. Frost became a partner, and the trading
name became Holden and Frost. On the death of the latter, in 1909, his interest in the
(business was purchased from the executors by Mr. Holden. In 1918 the undertaking
was converted into a Limited Company, of which Mr. H. J. Holden became Governing
Director, and Messrs. E. W. Holden (who is at present abroad) and A. M. Lemon Co-
Directors. This well-known establishment has recently been purchased by Harris Scarfe,
Limited, and was incorporated into that firm’s general business as from the beginning of
June. In addition to their extensive trade connection in the manufacture and sale of
saddlery and other leatherware, Messrs. Holden, during the last few years, had turned
their attention to a wider field of operation, and one that offered greater opportunities for
their energies. This was the Motor Body Building industry, and in December, 1917,
they absorbed the body-building words of Mr. Fred Hack. This industry has attained
such proportions as to require the whole of their energies, and this reason, combined
with health consideration, actuated Mr. FI. J, Flolden in agreeing to the sale of the
Grenfell Street business.

TYPE OF MEN EMPLOYED.
Is it any wonder that I readily availed myself of an invitation to visit the works?
Hence, a few weeks ago, in the genial company of Mr. H. J. Holden, I spent several
interesting hours in a pilgrimage through this throbbing hive of industry. I want to
say in the first place that one of the things that impressed me most was the type of
men employed. It is not my province to attempt a description, so perforce I content
myself by saying that I imagine it would be impossible to find a better body of men
employed elsewhere. There was a noticeable absence of the hustle and bustle one
naturally associates with a factory where the cost of every job is subjected to the
severest scrutiny. Yet each man was busy, and what is more, appeared to be taking an
intelligent interest in the task before him. and the thought flashed through my mind
that here, in what might be called an industrial world of its own, was a feeling of
contentment. It, therefore, came as no surprise to hear from Mr. Holden that the firm
had enjoyed an immunity from strikes. After inspecting the various suites of up-to-date
offices and prior to entering the workshops, Mr. H. J., as he is popularly called,
enlightened me by remarking that the major portion of the plant was either based on
their own ideas, or their own construction, or was the result of both. In course of my
tour, I had innumerable opportunities of inspecting and appreciating the creative and
engineering skill which is at the Company’s service. It is utterly impossible to give
here a detailed description of the various operations being performed on the 1800 bodies
going through the workshops at the time —and 1800 represent only 41 weeks’ supply!
A FAR-SIGHTED POLICY.
“As far as possible,” said Mr. H. J„ “it is the policy of the firm to make every-
thing for ourselves in order to obviate inconvenience and dislocation through strikes or
other causes, and in conformity with this plan, we have installed much valuable
machinery for making innumerable articles that hitherto had been manufactured else-
where.” As we proceeded through shop after shop, my attention was directed to quite a
number of instances where that sound policy was being given effect to. “How about
timber,” I queried, “you ean‘t make that?” “No.” said my guide, “but a proposition has
been put before us whereby we can secure the controlling interest in a big forest, and
the timber that could be cut from it is specially suitable for our requirements. However,
so far nothing has been decided.” Should the timber proposition materialise and a few
extra million feet be stacked on the firm’s recently-acquired 22 acres at Woodville, a few
miles out of Adelaide and nearer the seaboard, they would indeed be in a most enviable
position. One might then be justified in saying it was a self-maintained or self-contained
manufacturing world, perfectly in keeping with the gigantic operations of the firm.
Timber plays a great part in the Motor-body Building, and it was the first thing I saw
as I entered the factory—timber all shapes and sizes. But here I must emphasise.
Every piece, large or small, has to be cut to the correct size. There is no such thing
as “that’s near enough.” The standardisation principle would collapse immediately.
“Absolute accuracy!” That is the motto —it’s almost a fetish; it’s a corner-stone of the
whole organisation, and secret of the firm’s success.

The Growth of
a Great Australian Industry
Mr. A. M. LEMON,
L.1.C.A., A.A.1.5., Secretary.

Holden’s Motor Body Builders’ Limited.
STANDARDISATION AND SPECIALISATION.
“Standardisation work is the best that can be obtained,” remarked Mr. Holden with
particular emphasis. “If it were not so it would not be worth handling, and as we have
sent out about 7000 cars this half-year, and have had but few complaints, we can safely
say our methods are correct.” Surely this is overwhelming evidence that the firm has
reduced the specialisation system to as fine an art as it is possible for human agency
to do. Right through the shops—all replete with labor-saving devices —the Mill, the
Smithy, the Panel, the Body, the Paint, the Trimming, and the others, this specialisation
business was in operation. By the time we had arrived at the Paint Shop I had seen
so much of labor-saving appliances that when Mr. Holden jocularly asked me how long
I thought it would take to paint the body of a car, I was not prepared to even as much
as hazard a guess. “Have a try and I’ll bet you won’t get within 500 per cent, of the
time.” I made what seemed to me a ridiculously low guess. “Wrong! 45 seconds.’
He must have seen the expression of incredulity on my face. “Come on,” he said, “you
can check it for yourself.” I did. On a turntable covered in on three sides, rested a
body waiting for the paint. The taps were turned; the paint sprayed like mist; the
turntable slowly revolved; the job was commenced and finished; the body pulled out,
and the painter stood with an air of “next please” well within the 45 seconds. And
this turntable can put through 300 bodies per day !
Mr. P. J. ALLAN,
Works Manager.
EFFICIENCY AND HEALTH CONSIDERATION
COMBINED.
Two matters impressed me considerably not only in regard to the policy of the
Directors in maintaining their plant at its maximum point of efficiency, but also of
their desire to reduce to a minimum the possibility of danger or.menace to the health
of their employees. Where the power was derived from steam I noticed a commendable
absence of the overhead shafting so much in evidence in many establishments. The system
here is confined in an underground corridor and has the dual effect of reducing the
liability of accidents and the releasing of valuable space in the congested shops. Another
instance was in the shavings and sawdust exhausting and reclaiming apparatus just
erected in the Mill. The object is to suck the shavings and sawdust from the machines
immediately it is formed. This keeps the men and machines clean, and clears the air
of line dust from the timber. Two big galvanised-iron ducts, from which a series of
small pipes radiate to each machine, runs through the Mill. Two ducts lead through
the roof into the suction sides of an exhauster. The draught from the fan picks up the
sawdust and shavings as they leave the cutters. /V Cyclone Separator allows the air to
escape and the sawdust and shavings to drop into the fuel box for the boiler. Consider-
able economy is thus effected from the “savings” as the suction fan and the whole of the
Mill are driven from the steam-engine. The apparatus will shortly be in operation and
should prove a great boon to those working in the shops concerned.
CARRIAGE WORKS.
The activities of the firm are not confined to Motor-body Building. Within five
minutes’ walk of headquarters are the spacious and up-to-date Railway Carriage works.
The same practical and scientific engineering skill which played a predominant part in
bringing the Body Works to its state of perfection have been unstintingly employed here.
Everything has been designed and constructed for expeditiously handling these cumber-
some vehicles. Perhaps “cumbersome” is scarcely the correct definition, for, after the
information Mr. Holden gave me concerning the length of time occupied in lifting,
transporting and placing the carriage on the metals in the station yard, I am fully
convinced they can handle a railway carriage with greater ease, and certainly greater
dexterity, than the average person can a medium-size travelling trunk. I saw some
carriages which were in course of construction under contract for the South Australian
Government Railway Department, and in what may best be described as a specially-
constructed canvas room, was one receiving the finishing touches at the hands of master
craftsmen. I am sure it was with feelings of pardonable pride that my attention was
drawn to this, that and the other distinctive feature for it is hardly necessary to state
that the same high quality material, standard of workmanship and excellence of finish
to be found in the Body-building Shops, were in evidence here.
WELFARE OF EMPLOYEES.
In addition to keeping their shops as up-to-date as far as possible as regards
machinery and conditions of work, the Directors have not overlooked the health and
social requirements of their employees, and recently they have established a Welfare
Department working on the premises. Arrangements have been entered into which
entitles any employee and his family to receive medical attention at half fees, and the
same material consideration can be obtained from a dentist. A Sick and Accident Fund,
to which the Firm contributes an annual amount, has been built up, and since the October
balance something like £370 has been paid out. For convenience, and no less for the
encouragement of the employees, a depositing agency of the State Savings Bank has
been opened, and judging from the value of the deposits this facility is much appreciated.
Athletic pursuits have been well catered for. In this direction 18 acres on the South
Park Lands have been allotted to the firm by the Adelaide City Council. Four football
grounds enable the firm to run a football association of their own with seven departmental
teams. The area also includes four cricket pitches, four tennis courts and a bowling
green, whilst the swimming club next summer will serve as an instructional and pleasur-
able medium. Socially, the Directors have begun work with a band, a male voice party,
and an orchestra is promised in the near future. A Shops’ Council has been formed,
and on workdays the firm supplies the foremen with lunch in a well-furnished dining-
room. During that hour suggestions are made, and matters affecting the works and the
employees are unreservedly discussed. The retiring and dining rooms for the female
workers, and a casualty room in charge of a competent nurse, are features of which
few firms can boast. It is therefore easy to imagine the feeling of comradeship which
exists between all concerned.
ENORMOUS CONSUMPTION OF RAW
MATERIALS.
There is nothing like a set of figures to supplement a general review of a subject,
and as I considered some items regarding the annual requirements of material would
prove interesting, I made a few notes during my visit. Here are some of the main lines:
40,000 Hides of Leather.
1,000 Tons of Steel for Body Making.
120,000 Yards Carpet.
40 Tons Horsehair.
120,000 Yards Calico.
34,000 Cross Screws.
15,000 Sets Hood Bow Sockets.
2,000,000 Feet Timber.
In order to ensure the supply of the latter article, the Directors have undertaken the
chartering of ships, and a few weeks ago the six-masted schooner “Katherine” discharged
a million feet at Port Adelaide, and two more vessels are following. The foregoing
figures are sufficient to convey an idea of the quantity of material absorbed by this
rapidly-growing institution.

Sales Manager.
NEED FOR IMMEDIATE EXPANSION.
j ■
Proof of the pudding is in the eating, and it is the acknowledged superior quality
of Holden’s Motor Bodies that has led to the Firm’s meteoric development. But large
as are the present works, the weekly output of 400 bodies is totally inadequate for
existing requirements.
Every Department is feeling the pinch for room, and the Directors have been
forced to go outside the city in their efforts to satisfy the demand for space. Twenty-two
acres have been secured at Woodville, and no time is being lost in commencing building
operations. The new plant and machinery, costing between £55,000 and £60,000, will cover
a floor space of about 10 acres, and it is expected that the work of installation will
be completed by November or December. The Directors anticipate that when the new
factory is in full swing, and if the present demand for their motor bodies continues to
increase, as they have every reason to believe it will, they will find it necessary to
employ a further 800 men, making a total of over 2000 in the combined works, from which
the total output will be increased to considerably over 500 bodies per week. And what then?
Will it continue to increase by leaps and bounds? But whatever demands the future
may make there is no denying that the Firm is controlled by colossal brain force and
wills of steel, which have raised it to the premier position in the industry.
Mr. W. A. HOLDEN,
Production Manager.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
ROGER
GALLET

The Sydney woman has had to pluck her
French dictionary from the shelf to which
she consigned it on the departure of the
Jules Michelet. Some more French naval-
men are cheering us. Though perhaps not
quite so fascinating as the dear Admiral and
his merry men, Captain Housson and the
officers of the gunboat Aldebaran made quite
an impression on the French colony at St.
James’s Hall on Friday, when the Alliance
Francaise celebrated the Eve of the Four-
teenth by an hour or two’s dancing. The tri-
color and the Union Jack formed the backbone
of a decorative scheme that was otherwise
mostly palms. Consul Campana’s madame,
who was one of the hostesses, was happy
in the moment’s fashion decree of lace—
she wore it black over soft satin. The
McMillan lady clothed her slimness in jetted
black georgette; a beautiful mixture of prim-
rose satin and black Spanish lace was worn
by Mrs. Fiaschi; and Miss Soubeiran, who,
of course, was down from Bowral for the
day, trailed soft leaf brown. The Belgian
Consul Segaerts were there, and the Countess
de Champinorin whose dress of cloth of
silver was edged with monkey-fur, and pretty
French-Australian girls by the dozen.
The Commander Craufurd couple spread
a dinner-party for the Frenchmen at Tresco
during the week ; and Captain Housson and
his officers were the guests of honor at a
French reception and picnic on Saturday.
The reception, at the Consulate, was the
same as every other official levee; but the
picnic, at Clifton Gardens, was as only
France could have it. It was the first since
1914, and the whole French colony furned
out for a day under the speckless sky. There
were no special boats and no directions on
the tickets; so family parties caught just
whatever boat suited them best. But all
arrived in time for lunch in the big pavilion.
Attorney-General Bavin was there, and made
the usual long, winding speech of the poli-
tician ; and French Consul Campana gave his
address first in French, then iu English—
“for the visitors”—and if there had been
Arabs he’d have courteously turned on
Arabic or drowned in the attempt. The
captain of the Aldebaran, bearded like a real
sailorman, gave the toast of “The Ladies”
in rattling style, winning many a soft glance.
Mrs. Campana was banked on one side by a
naval officer, a stripling as to years and
build, but owning a wonderful growth of
side-whiskers; on the other side sat another
sailor-boy whose fair hair looked as though
it had just been beautifully marcelled. Child-
ren were everywhere, and some genius had
organised a race-system by which every
winner got a small toy and every loser a
packet of chocolate.
The banking girls and boys defied the ele-
ments and turned up at the Town Hall in
hundreds for their yearly flutter in aid of
Prince Alfred’s. The staff of the J.C.W.
firm had carried out the decorations in a
heavily beflagged and gaily-ribboned
scheme. Midway through the evening the
G.-G. Forsters arrived, and to them the six
little debs, duly bobbed, Lady Forster turn-
ing on them her warmest smile. This, allied
to a beautiful frock of lace, thickly crusted
with turquoise sequins; dazzled the embyro
women-Rothschilds more than a room-full
of golden bullion could ever do. Mrs. Kell,
who was the presentation link between them
and the vice-regals, murmured the intros, in
a gown of vellum sheen that enhanced its
looks by handsome black lace accessories. The
untiring Mrs. Gore-Jones glinted through the
evening as brightly as the jet trimmings on
her satin frock. But for the first time ami-
able Denison Miller was absent from the
vice-regal daijs, since banks and balls
must go on no matter what quarry Death
has stalked.
On the same night nearly 500 enthusiasts
waded or motored to the Wehtworth to
stagger through a jazz or two at the yearly
dance of the Catholic Women’s Association.
Mrs. John Barlow was president of the
dance, which had for its guest-of-honor song-
bird Stella Power, and to her the debs, were
presented.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers’s dance at Admiralty
House to finish up the Polo festivities
occurred on the wettest night of last week ;
and although the flood rains didn’t prevent
crowds of dancers from motoring, the
launches were not requisitioned to any ex-
tent. The ascent of the stone steps from
the landing w T ould have been something in
the nature of an Annette Kellerman stunt.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers, very pretty and graceful,
had a draped frock of her favorite blue that
flashes green tones; and her large feather fan
was in the same colorings. Most of the
frocking struck a highly vivid note, and
against the almost tropic coloring Mrs. Steenie
Osborne’s and Mrs. Frank Mitchell’s black
drapings stood out in almost violent relief.
Mrs. Vivers’s frock of blue shot with silver
was of modern old-world architecture, tiny
flounces as to skirt, and melting into a
silver and blue georgette bodice. Mrs. Alfred
Turnbull contrasted her creamy brunette
against flame-satin frocking; Mrs. Tony Hor-
dern gowned in cyclamen pink; and in the
legions of flappers present Bettine Brown,
from Melbourne, was a winner.
One sodden morning last W’eek the murky
depths of the Mayoress’s rooms witnessed as
amusing a comedy as ever went in search
of an author. From the moment Lady
Forster opened the meeting of the committee
for the Artists’ Ball with an intimation to
the press that, it being there on sufferance,
only “helpful” things should be printed,
everybody felt that something would happen.
In less than two minutes artist D. H. Souter,
who was in charge of the decoration com-
mittee, rose to question something in the
minutes, and across his sentences the vice-
regal lady cut with an icy call to order.
After that the dialogue between the sturdy
Scot and her Ex. was clearly, if uncon-
sciously, a duel of “class,” concluding with
Souter’s withdrawal.
Then the meeting grew even more like
something seen in a woolly dream. This
lady and that hopped up w r ith suggestions
more or less helpless—they knew of an artis-
tic young man, very clever, and they were
sure he w r ould take the decorations in hand.
At this Mrs. Bertie Kelly, refusing to be
out-trumped, produced Frederick Ward. Mr.
Ward had offered to do the decorations for
any ball of which Mrs. Kelly was organiser,
free. Theo Cowan, for the second time, blew
a breath of commonsense into the shapeless
argument by moving that some of the other
artists be asked to carry on the work; and
Thea Proctor hastily arid indistinctly washed
her hands of the decoration scheme. A woman
in the back row who had been trying to
attract attention burst in with a complaint
about the girl in the Australia who wouldn’t
allow a poster to be displayed above her
stall. This caused amused surprise. A girl
at a bookstall refusing permission to do any-
thing ! But, of course, she was not the one
to approach. Somebody would speak to the
directors; in fact, tw T o of the directors were
deeply interested in the ball. Then some
Goth in a small voice remarked, “But that
girl isn’t an employee; she_ rents the stand.”
A sudden silence galvanised the meeting.
The eviction laws having grown somewhat
rusty, nothing more was said about the girl
in the bookstall : but the indomitable Mrs.
Bertie produced “Mitchell, the head waiter,”
who, she said, would gladly act as ticket-
distributor. The number of mirrors for the
dressing-rooms proved a knotty problem.
Several women pleaded hard for the inclu-
sion of mirrors in the vestibule —“for a last
peep before entering the ballroom.” “Oh,
very well,' conceded Mrs. Kelly, “one mirror
in the vestibule, if you think it necessary.
I myself never look in one !” On that prick
the meeting burst.
The firmest city friend the Outback ever
had was Mrs. Aubrey Withers, founder of
the Bush Book Club. Hers was the hand

Withers had
one of those
rare visions
that come only
to great
minds. Her
last big work
was helping
the Queens-
land branch to
get into working order. Last week she died,
as gallantly as she had lived, at a private
hospital in North Sydney. Mrs. Withers
hailed originally from Maoriland; and dur-
ing the war one of her pet undertakings was
the Enzed Soldiers’ Club in Sydney.
The Mayoral Gilpin lady called a rally at
the Australia on Thursday to discuss means
of swelling the new fund for the proper re-
presentation of Australia at the Olympic
Games in Paris in 1924. So far only £l5OO
of the needed £4OOO from N. S. Wales is in
hand. A ball, of course, was decided on as
the quickest and surest way to get the
money together. It was christened the
Olympic, and knight Henry Braddon, an old-
time footballer, promised something of an
eye-opener in the way of spectacle. The
Consuls’ wives are arranging sets representa-
tive of their countries’ national games.
Annette Kellerman has promised to design
something very novel for her set —arid sister
Mips’s originality will again come in very
useful. The State Exes, and the G.-G.
couple are to give their patronage, Mayoress
Gilpin will have the committee in hand, and
Dame Mary Hughes and Mrs. William
Brooks will be her vices.
St. Mark’s, Darling Point, was chosen by
Joan Rolin, second bud in Judge Rolin’s
garden at Elizabeth Bay, for her wedding
with William Danger Owen. Joan’s favor-
ite color, yellow in masses of glowing blos-
som, supplied the splash of brightness inside
the church which the sun refused to give
the outside world ; for the rain poured down
in sheets. The slim bride, escorted by father,
walked to the tryst in vellum draperies that
trailed a silvery train with a primrose lin-
ing. A misty drape of lace, an enveloping
tulle veil, and a sheaf of arum lilies com-
pleted the dark-haired bride’s outfit. The
Justice Gordon chick, Ann, and the Werriwa
Gordon girleen, Philippa, who is a youthful
cousin of the bride, completed the golden
note in the color scheme. Their frocks were
of primrose crepe de Chine shining through
a veiling of Limerick lace; and their pretty
high gold baskets were brimful of yellow
pansies. Pat Itothe squired the ’groom, who
is the only son of Justice Owen, of Woollahra.
Joan, by the way, did her bit for Billjim as
a V.A.D. She was one of the most consist-
ent workers at Randwick, and helped artist
Maude Russell with her drawing classes for
bedridden soldiers.
There have been so many goings and com-
ings on the Supreme Court bench lately that
Philip Whistler Street is now the Senior
Puisne Judge,
although li e
didn’t take his
seat until 15
years ago. In
fact, though
he hasn’t quite
left the fifties
yet, he is the
Oldest Inhabi-
tant of the
Bench, for
Chief Justice
Cullen arrived
a couple of
years later
than he. And
as it happens
that both Gov-
ernor and
Lieut.-Gov. are
out of town- —
Sir Waiter has
gone overland
to Broken Hill
—Justice Street is Administrator, which is
to say vice-Deputy-Governor. Born in Syd-
ney (his father founded the Perpetual Trus-
tee Co., and was for years in the Assembly),
he passed from Sydney Grammar to the Uni.
and then to the dry-as-dust branch of the
law; and on the Bench he has joined his
brethren in maintaining its best traditions.
Miss Mary Floyd Williams, the writer
from California, who wants during her visit
to Australasia to help rivet a good understand-
ing between us and Uncle Sam, admits that
Americans like to tell other countries of the
good things they have. “Here in Australia,”
she says, “you do things in quite a different
way. When I remark on the beauty of your
country, my Australian friend replies, ‘lt’s
not too bad.’ Again when I praise your pic-
tures, or your buildings, my friend says,
‘Not too bad !’ It’s always ‘N.T.B.’ Even
when I’d been through a joss-house and
remarked to the Chinaman in charge, ‘You
have a fine joss-house here,’ he answered,
‘Him not too bad.’ ”
Australia continues to produce the little
mothers of Anzacs. Consider the 10-year-
old Irene Lee, of Byron Bay, w T ho had
escaped from a burning house when she re-
membered her baby brother and sister —two-
year-old twins—still inside. She ran back
and effected a double rescue, undeterred by
burning material which fell upon and set
fire to her clothes as she dashed into the
inferno for the second child. She is now in
hospital, suffering from burns. Her pluck
is to be rewarded by a medal. But she will
get more than that.
Mrs. Wright, wife of the Archbishop, has
had an operation performed on her foot, and
is a prisoner at Bishopscourt. She will go
away for a change as soon as she is able;
meantime the various church committees
over which she presides must needs do with-
out her valuable help.
Professor Mackail, who made his bow to
literary Sydney in the Great Hall of the
Uni. last vveek, is travelling with his women-
folk, who are charming the eye of Sydney
as much as the Oxford don is charming its
ear. Daughter Mrs. Thirkell, who lives in
Melbourne, is really beautiful. She is the
nearest approach to Annie Laurie, whose neck
was like the swan, that one can hope to see.
Until this dark lady with the red berries in
her hair burst upon the vision, that neck
had always sounded like a physical impossi-
bility. Mrs. Mackail has a beauty, quieter
than her daughter’s, but none the less- stir-
ring. Australia shouldn’t miss the lectures,
the ladies are so good to look at.
The Violet matinee for the Children’s Hos-
pital on the 26th will be at the Royal, and
not at the Palace Theatre, as at first an-
nounced. The play will be Shaw’s “Pyg-
malion,” and this performance will be the
kick-off for the five-night Repertory season of
the same play. But the matinee is quite in-
dependent of the Repertory season at the
Conservatorium. Mrs. Pitt Rivers will take
the part of Eliza Doolittle (created by Mrs.
Pat Campbell), who goes through a course
of boiling water and monkey brand as a pre-
liminary to her study of phonetics. Gregan
McMahon will be Eliza’s dustman forebear.
S’Sam Hordern’s lady has already paid £5O
for a box ; Walter Kirby is sending a load of
violets from Melbourne, and Mrs. Ken Rich-
ards will have charge of the sweet sellers.
St. Margaret’s babies are to have a mat-
inde on August 2. Capable Lee White pre-
sided at a meeting in the Australia on Mon-
day morning, and had the pleasure of receiv-
ing subscriptions which more than cover all
expenses. The Royal is to be the scene of
the frivol, which Clay Smith is organising;
and already the boxes have been bought up.
May Sheehan is secretary.

Now we. know where Norman Lindsay finds
the models for some of those brilliant
shockers!
Fifty years ago parson A. E. Selwyn
(afterwards Bishop of Newcastle) made a
special trip to Ballina, on the North Coast,
to marry five couples who lined up in a little
one-roomed building where now stands the
Ballina Public School. One of the couples
—James Ainsworth and his wife—celebrated
their wedding jubilee the other day. Three
of the other brides of that far-back day are
still living.
The Junior Red Cross is issuing a cookery-
book to help its funds. Mrs. Fred Aron-
son has compiled and edited it. The excel-
lent little “Red Cross Cookery Book,” com-
piled by Mrs. Erie Lowe during the war, and
now out of print, netted for the society’s
funds a handsome £5OO.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Parliament was opened in a splash of color —Sir
Matthew in his blue Windsor uniform, a spick-and-
span guard of honor from the loth Battalion, Major-
General Bruche in polished regimentals, and the Dis-
trict Naval-officer as well as Chief Justice MeCawley
and Macnaughton, J., to add bright spots of scarlet
to the show. Most of the women were muffled in
coats and furs, but under her white fox Mrs; Teddy
Theodore sported delphinium blue brocade, and Mrs.
Bruche was in black.
Queenslander Gwen Foot, who dances in the train
of Nur-el-din in “Cairo,” gave an exhibition of
Eastern pirouettes at Lennon’s the other day amid
sweet-peas and glad little squeaks of surprise and
admiration.
For analyst Palmer, of Maoriland, and his better-
half the Sligoes gave a luncehon at the Carlton, the
guests including Mrs. Forrest and Norman White
and F. B. Guthrie. Grand old man Palmer, now in
his 78th year, is keenly interested in the problem of
the prickly-pear, and has some very good-sounding-
theories regarding its destruction.
As if the weather was not cold enough, the Troca-
dero decided to do itself up in a snowstorm for a
masque ball. A chapel with lit windows gave a sug-
gestion of physical and spiritual warmth, and also
pointed the moral that the function was held to help
the St. Stephen’s Anglican Church building fund.
A 16th-century couple (Mrs. Reynolds and Miss
Jones) scored first prize for the best fancy rig. Mrs.
Nixon Smith, one of the conveners, was in shot pink
taffetas; the other, Mrs. Boyle, had moonlight blue
sequins on her tulle and satin black. Sapphire blue
adorned Mrs. Theodore, who fed a supper party or,
the balcony. And the Mayor of Brisbane beamed
upon all.
The last of the unmarried James Cowlishaw
daughters, Hilda, gave her hand to her chosen
Crowe, of Melbourne, in her dad’s home at Bowen
Hills the other day. She did it in grey georgette
over crepe de Chine embroidered in grey and blue
and under a silver tissue hat. Her sister, Mrs. de
Little, hostessed the wedding luncheon.
Further functions have been flung at the Maori-
land bowlers and their wives, including teas in the
Princess Mary Caf6, a jaunt to Sandgate in thy'
McKeen car, and a night at the Trocadero. T,

July 18 ,'7 7, EDISON
had a crazy idea
46 YEARS ago, as he worked in his laboratory, there came
to Thomas A. Edison an idea—a crazy idea his most
trusted assistant called it. But Edison had sufficient faith in
that idea to sketch a draft of the machine and to pencil on
it this prophetic declaration: —
"Just tried an experiment with a diaphragm having an embossing point, and
held against paraffin paper moving rapidly■ The speaking vibrations are indented
nicely, and, there’s no doubt I shall be able to store up and reproduce auto-
matically at any future time the human voice perfectly. ’
46 YEARS afterwards Edison was able to add another note
to his prophecy:—
"By constant experimenting we have got the phonograph to the point where an
audience CANNOT TELL WHETHER IT IS LISTENING TO AN
ARTIST’S OWN PERFORMANCE. OR OUR RE-CREATION OF IT.”
Ttu NEW EDISON
“The Phonograph with a Soul.”
"The New Edison" the great wizard calls his pet invention —and to-day you can
have an exact duplicate in your own home—to Re-Create (not merely imitate)
for you the performances of the world’s leading artists.
Surely this phonograph—bearing the name of the world s greatest inventor is
the one you want; write or call for Catalogues.

Permanent Hair Waving
Accentuates Attractiveness
The many advantages of softly waved hair are
too obvious to need much commendation. To
the smart woman, so important a part does it
play in her coiffure, that it has become quite a
fashionable craze. Farmer’s use a speoai, per-
manent hair waving process which produces
exquisite waves that remain the same even
after shampooing, and does not in any way
effect the growth, or destroy the natural sheen.
Appointments may be booked by personal
application in the Hairdressing Salon, Third

A lull in the winter blasts helped to draw
the crowd to the Grand National Steeple ; but
nearly every woman was furred to the teeth,
and nearly every girl was roofed with a
sporty velour. The vice-regal pen pi’ovided
no side-show for the terrace rovers ; but the
Irvine dame did her bit as understudy in a
brown frock warmed with a feathery stole
and topped by a black toque. Hoi’des of the
best-gilded and the best-dressed surged over
the asphalt—no longer has Toorak an undis-
puted claim to the flanking the guber-
natorial aviary. Mrs. William Leonai'd, with
a dusky-winged hat topping her black dress,
saw the sprints from the stewai’ds’ reserve.
Secretai’y Byron Moore, looking fit as a two-
year-old, brought, his pleasing other half,
who smiled in black silk and furs. Agar
Wynne convoyed Mrs. Agar and Mrs. Gil-
bert Lodge, the latter fur-caped to her heels
with a conclusion of fringe. Warrnambool’s
veteran solicitor Ai-dlie and his wife, who
reinforced the party, got away with a heavy
wad of bookies’ banknotes, and Agar smiled
as one w r ho had profitably backed his fancy.
Reggie Power, plumper than of old, was with
the Lauchie Mackinnon pair (she had her
head turbaned with vivid blue above sub-
dued tailorings). Mrs. Artie Staughton, who
brought daughter Lorie and Oliphant Shaw,
was a vision in dark furs and black velvet
hat. Mrs. Philip Russell stood attractively
in grey-furred black tailorings. Mrs. Harry
uhiting carried round a shooting-seat and
t .ok her ease on the lawn while her sister,
Mrs. Alan Spowers, mopped her pretty face
with an outsize in powder-puffs. A Herbert
Power daughter, in navy tailorings and furs
and a red toque, introduced a youthful Anglo-
Indian matron —a good lookei-, with a nice
taste in chiffons. Norman Wilson’s popu-
lar wife sat with a sister, Mrs. Walter
Bayles, who wore her head inside a dark lid
embellished with pale green powder-puffs.
Mrs. Russell Clarke, in brown fur shoulder
wraps and smart mole tailorings, had on her
head a becoming inverted saucepan effect
in mole-colored velvet with feathery plu-
mage along the rim. Essa D’Ebi'o Bari’a-
clough had sacrificed the family Paisley
shawl to provide the vei’y latest in coatees.
But the thing that made feminine eyes glint
most enviously was a fair unknown who
trailed a Kolinsky cape with silken fringe
hemming, a brand of fur which sneei’ed. aud-
ibly at the camouflaged fox and bunny in its
vicinity.
Race Week was abloom with jazzes. The
Artie Staughtons, down from their sheep-
run, gave a celebration dinner for daughter
Lorie and her fiance, Oliphant Shaw. The
food was spread at Menzies’, with a floral
dressing of white and mauve. The Purves
Smiths had a bigger party at the same place,
and later the two lots jazzed as one on Paul
Bibron’s new dance-floor at “Old Admiralty
House.” Mrs. Ernest Poolman hostessed
a one-step at her South-Yarra place the fol-
lowing evening for Nora Knox, who is over
from the Harbor. Wilma Clarke netted the
night after for a little taqgo, which was staged
at the parental Winmarleigh. Then the
Alex. Russells conspired with Mrs. Alex.’s
brothei’. Beau Fairbairn, to farewell the
parental South Yarra home, lately acquired
by the Russell Clarke pair, with a little jazz
flutter —a very swish affair, the guest-list
being chiefly of the Fairbairn and Clai’ke
clans.
The Brighton Allards’ youngest daughter
Isabel, xvho has been sampling Ceylon’s spicy
breezes —which aren’t always innocent of
other scents—prefaced her approaching re-
turn by the incoming mailboat with a con-
fession. The young, man is the eldest hope
of the L. O. Leetes, of Colombo, and he has
thus far the names Lionel, Guthbert and
Arden all to himself.
Shutters were officially downed at the
State House on July 11, with rather less
pomp and rather more decorum than was
obsei’vable at the Federal affair. No ci’owd-
ing, no scramble —a seat for everyone, and
everyone for a seat. After the opening cere-
money the lace-ruffled knight-president of the
Leg. Council, Walter Manifold, spread the
usual tea-party, with Lieut.-Gov. Irvine’s
lady as star guest. She had furred herself
above black velvet, and jabbed a dusky quill
thi’ough the front verandah of her hat. The
crowd was liberally sprinkled with political
dames, reinforced by an overseas dame of
another order—Adelaide Anderson, Inspector
of Factories in London, who claims this city
as her birthplace. State Treasurer McPher-
son’s lady moved round unobtrusively in all
black with sables to keep the cold out. Little
Mrs. Frank Clarke, also furred to the eye-
brows over navy tailored effects, featured the
latest in London toques, a cap-like cover-
ing of henna and gold brocade. The Russell
Clarke matron, heavily furred, aired another
Bond-street millinery triumph in black velvet.
The dressily-ambitious crowded round to pros-
pect these new hattings—it is so important
to discover whether hat-crowns are x’ising
or falling on the fashion market before
snatching your choice off the bargain-counter.
Speaker Mackey’s lady, who smiled gener-
ously under her black hat, had “coated her-
self in fawn with skunk furring the collar.
Anglican Archbish. Lees stepped round with
his bigger half. Seemingly the lady doesn't
worry her head about sartoi-ial technique—
her tailorings were simple and grey and her
hat black. Alexander Peacock’s wife was
sabled over a blend of white and primrose,
and Dr. Stanley Argyle’s other half was a
symphony in cornflower-blue. Lesley Madden
Nelkin, in black, convoyed her husband, who
looked as if he liked it. John Monash turned
up, and was besieged with inquiries re the
possibilities of cheap electric lighting and
briquettes by worried housewives, and his
optimistic ctieei’iness on the subject encour-
aged them to enjoy their tea.
When the girls at the Albert-street Gon.
found that fellow-student Thelma Ferguson
was preparing to quit the big aviary for the
matrimonial cage (Dr. de Bavin, of Ingle-
wood, is the other love-bird in the case), they
got together, to farewell her over the tea-
cups at Buckley’s, the chief movers being
Dulcie Cherry, Jean Hambledon, Marie Leth-
bridge, Olive Thorpe, Marie Bremner and
others. The presentations included an auto-
graphed album —a volume which may in time
to come prove to be full of world-shaking
names.
Marion Jones, the clever Bendigo girl who
won the National Gallery travelling scholar-
ship a couple of years back, had her pic-
ture “Cui bono?” (of which the only weak
feature is the title) accepted for the Royal
Academy this year, and received such recog-
nition from the critics that the Tatler
asked for a full-page-reproduction in color, and
the Gentlewoman begged fi photo and par-
ticulars of the young artist’s career. Almost
simultaneously La Revue Moderne and La
Revue du Vrai et du Beau, of Paris,
hunted her down in her flat in Chelsea and
retired with interviews to be illustrated with
photos of herself and her work. The cause
of this inquisitiveness from over the Chan-
nel was the granting of a good position in
the annual Salon to her portrait of Billy
Hughes. The canvas, painted in Melbourne
in a few snatched sittings, is a capital like-
ness of the little man. Anent this perfor-
mance there is a story to the effect that on
his first appearance before the artist Hughes
asked her facetiously how she would like him
to look, and she demurely replied: “Try to
look like a statesman, Mr. Hughes.”
Doris Mclnnes, the bright young Mel-
bourne singer, has just unpacked her voice
again in this city after an absence of six
years. In
1916 she trans-
ferred to Syd-
ney, which led
to matrimony
and then the
Solomon
Islands. Her

under Mrs,
Pinschof, hav-
ing netted
scholarships at
both music-
making fa c-
tories. The voice, a sweet, supple soprano,
got its first public airing at one of the local
municipal concerts in the opening year of
the war, and made rather more than the
usual success of the Mad Scene from “Lucia.”
After resting her caravan in Melbourne for
a space the songstress will jog off to the
Old World.
Winifred Butler had substituted pinky
effects for the customary bridal white when
she met Colin Harper the other evening in
Toorak St. John’s, where the same rosy
colorings were featured in the decorations.
She trailed pink crepe, freckled with pearls
on the upper storey, and backed by a floating
length of silver brocade under auntie Percy
Howard’s Limerick lace veil. Roses, also
pink, blossomed in her bouquet. Sister Maed-
hail Harper and Adna Butler bridesmaided,
with the assistance of little Lorraine Butler,
cousin and god-daughter of the bride; all
in more .pink—georgette hooped round the
skirts with brocaded velvet, and wreathed
at the equator with silver flowers. On
their heads rested roses —pink, too. Cousin
Rainey Harper had come across from the
Harbor to support Colin, and Fritz Gale
was there as next-best man—and they were
in the pink of' condition. Architect Walter
Butler led his chick to the sacrifice, and after-
wards he and his wife staged the usual jazz
at their Toorak flat, Studley. Mrs. Walter
had lightened her black velvet draperies with
a paste ornamentation, which anchored the
loopings, and a silver lining in the tail-end ;
and a rose—pink—and a silver lace inlet
lent a festive air to her inky hat. Illness
prevented Henry Harper from seeing his only
son face the ordeal, but Mrs, Henry, in black,
was there ; also. her mother-in-law, Robert
Harper’s widow, who looked surprisingly
youthful in another all-black creation. Gen-
eral Grimwade was first speaker at the feast,
which was spread amid a ton of flowers —
yes, pink again.
Victoria won’t need an intro, to Elwood
Mead: no public officer was better known
than he when he served the State as Chair-
man of the
Water Supply
Oommiss ion
from 1907 un-
til the Big War
started. There
was never a
farmer too
small to get
from this
quiet, helpful
American the
be s t advice
that was in
him. When
the great
trouble started
in Europe
Mead said to
the Govern-
ment : “Now
I think you'd
better let me
go. You won’t
want to spend
money while this is an, and to save my
salary will be something.” So he went back
to America, became Professor of Rurhl Edu-
cation at the California University, and
served his country on numerous commissions,
mainly in connection with soldiers and hand
settlement. News of the invaluable wgtrk
he had done in cleaning up a land-settlement
mess reached the N.S.W. Government; and
it invited him back to Australia for six
months to advise what to do with Yanko
and other schemes. The picture herewith
is a portrait of a painting made by Spencer
Macky, which now hangs in One of the Cali-
fornia University’s institutions. And there’s
an Australian interest in that, too, 'for
Spencer Macky, dean of the Uni.’s Art
Schools, is a Maorilander by birth who got
most of his training in Melbourne.
An old Gippsland identity who hauled his
last log recently was the Owner of a fine
brick house well furnished throughout; but
when he was not out with his bullock-team
(one of the best on the mainland) he camped
in a decrepit humpy alongside. Every Spring
the house was given a good cleaning; but for
the rest of the year it was locked up. Local
tradition tells of an eleventh-hour escape
from matrimonial entanglements; but the old
chap could only be drawn on one subject—
bullocks.
Burnett Gray, who wears St. Ivilda’s
bunny-skin, sidetracked the Mayoral jazz this
year with a musical at-home in the Town
Hall. The thing was earmarked “for patri-
otic workers only.” Town Clerk Fred
Chamberlain had been toiling overtime for
weeks, with the result that the patriots
walked straight out of a murky winter chill
into the joyous warmth of Arcadia. The
ceiling was a Pinky Way of rose-colored
lights twinkling over pink blossoms; fiery
sunset effects glowed redly through the win-
dows, and emerald spotlights transformed the
stage with its evergreens, pot-plants and
blossoming cherry-trees into a fairy glen.
Mrs. Burnett Gray smiled her welcomes from
under a black satin hatbrim, sporting a
bunch of heather, over navy tailorings and
a white fox-fur. The Mayoress of Melbourne,
buttressed in brown velvet, came to add civic
weight to the occasion, and Ethel Campbell, the
Girl from Durban, and her parents shared the
celebration. The musical fare was more
than satisfying. Waller Kirby, taking one
encore with another, must, have given a
round dozen numbers. Jo Foster’s baritone,
Doris Mclnnes’s soprano, Eileen Pascoe
Webb’s contralto and the fingers of city-
organist H. J. Inge all put admirable patches
on a fine programme. The tea-and-cake was
consumed at small tables, all a-blowirig with
early wattle and yellow poppies, and be-
tween whiles an orchestra supplied a melo-
dious background.
A visitor now viewing the beauties of the
Yarra is, Father van der Schueren, a Dutch
Jesuit, attached to the Belgian Mission in
India. He has been entitled to wear the
Kaiser-i-Hind medal (first-class) since
George R.’s last birthday.
Alliance Franeaise members, with a make-
weight of British-tongued jazzers, packed the
St. Hilda Hall the other night for the Black
Cat Ball. The edifice had been converted
into a gorgeous orange grove that seemed
to sprout cats on every branch. The fun o'
the revel opened out at midnight, whea
French National Day was ushered in witl
much spectacular jollity. Yellow caps, decc
rated with more cats, hailstormed from the
ceiling, and were donned by the dancers who
played “ring-a-rosy” round Hazel Harris and
Wesley Pearce at the end of their special
double turn. All who had the vaguest idea
how to dance the Polonaise joined in with
the more expert, after which they proceshed
round the hall chorusing the “Marseillaise”
behind Mrs. Jimmy Dyer wrapped in a
Union Jack and Mrs. Turck in the French
bunting. Minus her flag Mrs. Jimmy, who
was chiefly responsible for the thing, flut-
tered redly in geranium-colored silk, and
Mrs. Turck in beaded panelled effects but-
tressing peach satin. The whole “Tan-
gerine” co., barring Mamie Watson, came
when their own show was over.
The allegation that women don’t know
how to run, in skirts or out of them, should
never be levelled at some of the girls who
saw a stray bullock toss a man on Fleming-
ton lawn the other Wednesday. Their rush
to the grandstand haven was running at its
best. Three mounted police set after the
bullock and tried to get him hemmed in
while they held him by his horns or tail,
but the poor thing was wet and slippex-y
at both ends, and the police hold on him was
like one’s grip on a piece of ice. And then,
just as the bullock was about to run into
the betting ring, and scatter all the bookie
gentlemen and their customers like chaff be-
fore the wind, it slipped on the wet bricks
and was shot by a trooper. The ill-fated
creature had escaped from a herd in the
Flemington-road and trotted up the long
motor drive. Slaughter awaited him wher-
ever he went.
Mayor Swanson and his dame have taken
the Town Hall for the night of August 2,
when they will wind up three years of un-
stinted hospitality with a ball-party, upon
which the vice-regal Irvines will shed lustre.
Evelyn Scotney, Melbourne’s good-looking
and beautifully-frocked concert artist, has
just announced her engagement to Archibald
Hoadley, the geologist, who is principal of
the Footscray Technical College. This will
be Evelyn’s second plunge. Her first hus-
band was singer Howard White, who died of
pneumonic influenza in America. Mr. Hoad-
ley was a member of the Mawson Antarctic
expedition. Ip addition to brains, he pos-
sesses a fair share of this world’s goods. The
engagement comes as a surprise, as Evelyn
had been touring Maoriland and was plan-
ning a conquest of Queensland.
The Women Automobilists gathered for a
glad afternoon of tea, music and, of course,
chatter in their club receiving-rooms at
Anzac House. The musical menu, arranged
by Mrs. H. J. Robertson,, was served up
under the soft blush of pink-veiled lights
delicately creepered with asparagus-fern, and
was contributed to by Violet Parkinson, Mrs.
Trythall, Mrs. George Ilaimes, Seeley Samp-
son and Mrs. R. herself.
The Herald Ideal Homes and Gladys
Moncrieff got a united puff the other after-
noon, when the latter wirelessed several
songs from Collins House to the Olympia
Entertainment Hall. The place was tnronged.
After the Marconi sing-song, Gladys hos-
tessed an afternoon tea at the Exhibition—
at least, that is what the invitation said;
actually, having been whirled off to judge a
jazz competition, she only got back to pick
up the crumbs. The star had her cropped
head enclosed in a floral toque and wore a
fur coat. The Best dame, convoying tw T o
cheerful-looking daughters, wms chief guest.
Mrs. Charlie VVenman smiled under another
floral thatch, with cherries tickling her ears.
May Beatty, who lately tottered off the ’flu
list, had green under her fur; Nell Payne
radiated in yellow, and Cecil Bradley was
demure in black.
The Duke of Leinster, whose financial
affairs are undergoing a publicity campaign
in Fogtown, has relations here. Lord Charles
Fitzgerald, an uncle, who married actress
Athena Claudius’s sister (since deceased),
settled on the land. With his Digger sons
he is now tormenting the soil up Horsham
way. His tall daughter Nesta, who went
over and made her curtsey to George and
Mary, was lately a cashier in a city house
devoted to expensive personal upholstering.
A younger girl said “I will” to Digger
McCracken, and squats with him in the
Riverina.
A little note from Adelaide:—
Adelaide has just opened its long-waited-for Dental
Hospital, just behind the General Hospital. With a
degree course in dentistry at the University, it was
felt necessary to treat the practical side of the work
with equal fulness. A former G.-G., Munro Ferguson,

The hardest thing ever said about community

by”—so-and-so. It’s no good S’Langdon telling us
it was a misprint: we won’t believe it.

If you purchase scientifically, your choice
must fall on the ESSEX
AN important purchase running into hundreds of pounds should not be made in a
Jl \ haphazard fashion. Therefore, do not select a certain car merely because a
neighbour has had satisfaction from another of the same make.
It is possible that half-a-dozen other makes would have given him equal satisfaction
These are days when buyers should not be content with average results, they owe it to
themselves to secure the best obtainable for their money, from every possible view point
—therefore "Purchase Scientifically”! Weigh the following considerations before
finalising your choice.
1. The manufacturer, his record and present state of prosperity.
2. The local d istributor, his status and likelihood of permanency.
3. The service that is available locally in repairs and spare parts.
4. The saleability of the car in the second-hand market when
you desire to exchange it for a later model.
5. Whether a manufacturer chops and changes his models, or
continually improves a practically standardised type. An
entirely new model depreciates previous types to the detri-
ment of owners thereof
6. The design of the chassis, particularly as regards strength,
simplicity, accessibility, all bearings, and other adjustments.
7. The record of the car under local conditions, both m private
use and in officially supervised competitions.
8. Its performance, in regard to hill-climbing, speed, flexibility
and comfort.
9. The type of people that, purchasing the particular make
under consideration, are they good judges, or just guessers ?
10. General appearance and price.
A keen seller who has nothing to hide will withhold no portion of the above-men-
tioned considerations. In fact, it should be given without need of request.
If you follow the dictates of the first five considerations you will contract the selection
to the few outstanding makers of giant proportions who dominate the market —with
a decided leaning towards the HUDSON-ESSEX organisation, which has made
more strides than any other similar concern over the past few years.
Considerations "six” to "ten” if properly investigated will finally cement your choice to the
ESSEX, for no other car has ever done so much to prove its worth to the buying public. Where
others loudly proclaim what they can do, the ESSEX merely points towhai it actually has done.
ESSEX for Efficiency — why should a man purchase a lesser car ?

The pace for this year’s 6. N. Steeple was
slow only in comparison with times when the going
was good. Apparently the course was too heavy to
admit of a speedy vanguard making haste over the
jumps with a quite ordinary chance of success. The
first well-backed horse to fall was Coolport, leading
the field in seemingly easy style at a mile or so. Up
to then the Cooltrim gelding had been showing the
way to Faithful Knight, Haoma, Liberate and the
outsider Sunnymead. With Coolport disposed of,
Haoma was two or three lengths ahead of Liberate,
who passed Faithful Knight and was jumping very
differently from what he had done on the Wednesday.
They were well into the last mile of the journey when
Haoma showed about four lengths ahead of Liberate,
with Faithful Knight following at a respectful dis-
tance, and the others many yards further away. Then
Faithful Knight fell. Haoma now had a three lengths’
pull over Liberate, the others looking very unlikely.
But at the fence three furlongs from home the leaders
fell, neither being accountable for the other’s blunder.
Thereupon the finish was left to Wooloo, Monrose and
Kunjolio, if they stood up to the bitter end. They
took the jumps safely, and weight told its tale, Kun-
jolio having 291 b. the better of it with old Wooloo,
who had 121 b. advantage over Monrose. The dividing
distances were three lengths and six lengths, and the
time 6min. 34isec.
Wooloo has been decidedly unlucky in Nationals.
He was second three years ago when the accom-
plished Boyd was aboard. On that occasion the
jockey, as he admitted after the race, didn’t make
enough use of Wooloo’s stamina. The gelding, who
is neither fast nor slow in steeplechase company,
was allowed to plod away at the outset when he
should have been pressed forward. As it was, he
had too much ground to make up in the last mile,
and lacked the pace necessary to overhaul Mountain
God. Steeplechases are often lost in the first mile.
In winning the Doutta Galla Hurdle, with 2st.
more than his National weight, Berrinbo demon-
strated what a good thing he had been for the big
race a week earlier. Of his old opponents, Bendoc,
Loja, Sandule, Brownland, Gulyarri and Jaekstaff,
the last-named had staled off, as he threatened to
do at the finish of the National. They were all
meeting Berrinbo on considerably better terms than
before, but the handsome little bay put in an im-
pressive run at the finish. Just at present he is
making the most of his “classiness,” and if he goes
for the Australian Hurdle at Caulfield next month
Berrinbo will have a great following despite his
list. 111 b. But he may have had more than enough
of it by that time. A rather difficult one to train,
he cannot be an easy one to keep ripe.
The victory of Sunburst in the sprint race was .a
pleasure to sporting folk, if only for its complete up-
set of the “fly-flat” theory that the Newmarket winner
was merely out for a gallop. Eric Connolly backed
his trusty flier solidly without counting him a cer-
tainty, as in previous races. How this fine strong
horse came to lose the Oakleigh Plate by a head to
Chelidon is one of the glorious inexplicabilities of
racing.
* * * *
“Wodgil”: Allen Doone, the Irish actor,
couldn’t help backing a couple of long-priced win-
ners at Ascot (N.S.W.) on Saturday. They were
thrown at him, so to speak, by the raeebook. In
the second division of the seven-furlong Winter
Cup there was a steed called All Irish, by Some-
thing Irish —Mrs. Bourke. Doone backed it at
S’s, and home it rolled. In the third division there
was a certain Plain Doone, and the other plain
Doone was in such a hurry to get on that he placed
his money at B’s when 12’s were obtainable. How-
ever, Plain Doone had its head in front at the
right end. In the run-off for first prize—it was a
£5OO cup—The Gamble was 5 to 2 on, All Irish
3 to 1 and Plain Doone 5 to 1. Tormented by
doubts as to whether he should back one or two,
Doone finally put his poultice his homely name-
sake. only to see All Irish donkey-lick it after The
Gamble had cracked up. All the same, Allen re-
turned to his pub £6OO ahead of it. About the
oddest instance on record of a name-coincidence
indicating a winner occurred at Bicton (W.A.) the
day after Britain declared war. On that occasion a
pony called France, ridden by the jockey England,
won the Allies Handicap. Rank outsider, too.
* * * *
“The Deacon”: “Nemo’s” par. about a
trotting mare that was sold for £7 (B. 12/7/’23)
reminds me of the luck of Fred Jones, of Penrith
(N.S.W.). When Jones acquired Forest King a few
years back he didn’t know a pacer from a square-
gaiter, and had no intention of using the pony
other than for a sulky horse. But a neighbor who
had followed the business in America realised the
possibilities of the King and gave Jones a few
wrinkles. Profiting by the information, Jones
learned how to ride, improved his knowledge of
driving, and won many races with Forest King
before he sold him for stud purposes to a cocky at
Grafton. A year or two ago he bought Black Hawke
out of the pole of a hearse at Mudgee. The Hawke
was likewise a profitable speculation. But Jones’s
best meal-ticket was Black Rust, which he bought
out of the shafts of a rabbit-cart for £3O, and with
which he pulled off one of the biggest starting-price
coups that the Londonderry (N.S.W.) course has
ever experienced. Having done pretty nicely, thank
you, Fred quitted the game lastly ear for keeps.
“Baro”: Peter Felix (B. 5/7/’23) was
lacking in something more essential to a pugilist
than ferocitv. He had enough ferocity to beat
Doherty at Kalgoorlie, though he was robbed of the
fight, as “The Deacon” says (B. 5/7/’23). When
they met later he stiff had sufficient of that commo-
dity to knock chips off the white. But the fighter
in Doherty refused to
quit. He put every-
thing he had into a
punch which bumped
Felix on the nose.
Peter crumpled up like
a wet sack and waited
for the end of the
count. That is the
only important fight
in the history of pug-
dom which was won
by a punch on the
nose. Anyhow ferocity’
is not a' necessity in
the equipment of a
pug. Peter Jackson —
of whom the other
Peter claims to be a
first cousin —had none
of it. When he had
Slavin beaten he
dropped his hands and
looked appealingly at
the referee, but the
latter’s “Fight on”
forced him to knock
Paddy out. When Les
Darcy entered the
ring he was just a
smiling, easy-going
boy. He boxed his
opponent with perfect
good humor, but ex-
pected to be treated
in a like manner.
Some of his antago-
nists knew this and
tried to oblige him,
but in the excitement
of a tussle they would
sometimes forget ancf
land an unlovely
whack about his sacred
person. Darcy’s next punch generally settled it.
* * it *
Having got right back to his 1919 form
Digger Evans (Bst. 13jib.) was too fast and too strong
for Jimmy Semmens (Bst. 71b.) at the Sydney Stadium.
The grinning A.I.F. bruiser has never boxed better.
His speed and agility mystified Semmens, who was
a 2-to-l-on favorite, and he ran out an easy winner
at the final bell. Evans would be a real champion
but for one thing. Like 90 p.c. of Australian pugs
he lacks the punch.
* * * *
Ern Baxter, of Lithgow (N.S.W.), is the
Commonwealth’s new featherweight champion, hav-
ing wrested the honor and glory, together with a
£lOO wager and 25 p.c. of the gate, from Mr.
William Grime, who comes from the Riverina.
Grime made all the fight, but didn’t know how to
handle a youth who shapes right foremost and be-
lieves in boxing for safety. Also William was
visibly depressed by the Melbourne crowd’s strange
but ineradicable hostility to him. The winner should
be fairly easy for Spargo.
Ern Waddy, of Adelaide, is very short for
a heavyweight, but there is no doubt about his
punch. ” In half-a-round he deprived Jim Dwyer,
the Queenslander, of his Australian title, and in
half-a-round he has extinguished the hopes of Fonce
Mexon, who whipped Dwyer at Newcastle (N.S.W.).
Waddy is going to Brisbane to let Charlie Taylor
have a cut at his crown. Taylor, a 12st. 71b. man
from Aramac, owns an excellent left, and if he
makes judicious use of that member the champion-
ship will change hands.
The Spanish-speaking peoples must be get-
ting their tails up. In one week Firpo licked Willard
at New Jersey, and Alonzo soundly whipped the
mighty Tilden in the final of the Illinois champion-
ship at Chicago. It was a three-set-to-one victory,
Tilden scoring in the second chapter after it had
gone to 24 games, so the Spaniard’s calibre must
be greater than it was in the .exciting struggles
with the English and the Australians for the Davis
Cup last year. Meantime Alonzo’s compatriots,
Flaquer and De Gomar, have started further flag-
waving in old Castile by massacring the Dutch at
Eastbourne, which gives them the right to meet
France for the premiership of the European zone. The
French, who gained their expected win over the Swiss,
are probably delighted to hear that Alonzo is remain-
ing in America. All the same, Flaquer and De Gomar
will give them a struggle, and may quite likely
win. This result would take the Spaniards to
America, where, with the help of Alonzo, their
chances of reaching the challenge round would be
greatly enhanced. Australia’s first match for the
Cup will be against Hawaii at Orange, New Jer-
sey, just a nice motor run from their camp at
Forest Hills, New York. This occurs next week,
and if our fellows lift a majority of the rubbers
they’ will then have to encounter the Japs. Specu-
lation regarding this second battle with Nippon
has been increased by the retirement of Kumagae
and the selection of Fuzuda as Shimidzu’s partner.
Shimidzu’s ability is well known, but the only
information about the other is that he is a good
player, somewhat lacking in match experience.
* * * *
“15-30”: Judging by cabled reports from
the U.S. the Australian Davis Cuppers are keeping
in good fettle by sticking to practice matches with
men who can give them something of a game.
Hawkes knocked out Dean Mathey, who, though not
of the calibre of Johnston, Tilden or Richards, is
a player of some prominence. Anderson likewise de-
feated Washburn, the burly, spectacled giant, who
came out to Auckland with Tilden and Johnston in
1920. His size has deceived many into a fond belief
in his lethargy, but he can move about with alacrity
when necessary, and his beautifully-placed shots have
worried the best opponents. Though he must now be
getting on, he still ranks high as a doubles player;
so the victory of Mclnnes and Sc-hlesinger over him
and Count Salm is something for the Victorians
to be proud of. It would seem that Mclnnes and
Sehlesiriger have paired off for practice purposes
against Anderson and Hawkes, which encourages the
belief that these two will also appear on the doubles
court in the coming battles.

The Australasian Waterloo Cup, decided
at Warwick (Q.), proved easy for the N.S.W.
champion Drew’s Hope, who beat Erin’s Own in the
final. Drew’s Hope is owned by Dave Darcy, of
Bega (N.S.W.), whose Bint Helwa also won the
Purse, while his De Valera divided the Plate money
with Hawk King (Q.) and Green Wave (N.S.W.).
AFTER THE NINETEENTH ROUND.
DISGUSTED SPECTATOR: “W’y don ’ cha give ’em a round table?”
Drew’s Hope has now two Australasian Waterloo Cups
(’2l and ’23) to his credit. He has also landed
the 1921 Taranaki Cup (M.L.) and the 1922 N.S.W.
Champion Cup. The industrious animal is now in
Victoria in quest of that State’s Waterloo Cup and
the £lOOO which goes with it.

When North Sydney donned their football
togs to meet Western Suburbs on Saturday their
chances looked small. They were without the ser-
vices of their speed-merchants, Blinkhorn and
Horder; moreover skipper Dune. Thompson had a
damaged shoulder, and decided to play full-back.
He remained in that position until West had scored
7 points to nil, whereupon he resumed his old
position behind the pack. A great change came
over the scene.- Getting plenty of ball from John-
son, Thompson heaved it out briskly. Peters sped
over and Dallas Hodgins hoisted 3 goals. That
made it 9 to 7 in North’s favor. After the spell
West’s ruck men swept the Red and Blacks off their
feet and regained the lead. But only for a time.
Peters galloped over the chalkline twice, Parnell
and the apprentice- Steele added a try apiece,
Hodgins hoisted three more goals, and at the end
North owned 27 points to West’s 12. The Shore-
men had put on 18 points in as many minutes. For
the losers Courtney played a wonderful game—and
he will never see 38 again. Another surprise was
Glebe’s victory over Newtown, 24 points to 2. Bal-
main beat St. George by 23 to 3, and Eastern Sub-
urbs inflicted another defeat on ’Varsity—l2 to 5.
North, South and East are still together at the top
of the class.
* * * *
“Sixenate” : Torn pants supply about the
only humor there is in League matches. In a recent
Sydney fixture a burly leather-chaser, getting the
ball near centre from a ruck which deprived him of
his trousers, sprinted on oblivious of his distressing
condition, and scored. Last week a player discovered
that his “strides” were gone, and sat down suddenly
in the enemy’s twenty-five. In the ordinary course
of events first-aid would have been provided at once,
but there were only a couple of minutes to go, and
in a fierce rally his plight was ignored. The ball
was rushed to the other twenty-five, and then, in a
passing rush, came back. With a yell the pantless
youth jumped un, received a pass and dashed on. A
multitude of defenders fell on him hear the line.
Then the whistle blew and he remained down, with
friend and foe gathered round, until one of the pam-
pered minions who attend to these matters arrived
with the necessary garment.
* * * *
Saturday’s League games in Melbourne
were strenuous, not to say furious. Carlton, prac-
tically out of the finals, met Fitzroy, at the top of
the list, and outed them by 1 point—B6 to ’Roy’s
85. A willing scrap enlivened the proceedings, and
at the end the umpire promised to report five players
for rough play. A Collingwood man is also to be
carpeted for disorderly conduct against South Mel-
bourne, and Cordon Coventry, ’Wood’s best forward,
broke his collar-bone, so the Magpies are unhappy.
They held their own up to lemon-time, but after
that South’s determined rushes carried the day—
-77 points to ’Wood’s 56. Richmond downed Mel-
bourne by 5 points, kicking a goal just as the bell
rang.. Essendon booted one paltry goal and 12
behinds, while St. Kilda methodically put on 5 goals
5 behinds. It was a dour day for the ’Dons.
* * # *
“Tren”: Despite the sneers of “Ex-Eng-
lishman” and “Past Grammar,” my account of the
genesis of Australian football is gospel. To 1858
there were no football teams in Victoria. In that
year T. W. Wills (captain of the cricket XI and
of the Rugby team at Rugby School) returned from
England, and suggested to H. C. A. Harrison, W.
Hammersley and J. B. Thompson, of the Melbourne
C.C., that a team be formed. He said that Rugby
was too rough for men who had to earn their
living (meaning himself, his friends and the people
he hoped would become his opponents), and recom-
mended “a gentler game that they would invent
themselves.” For eight years it was go as you
please. Then in 1866 H. C. A. Harrison, at the
request of delegates of the four senior clubs (Mel-
bourne, South Yarra, Royal Park, Carlton), drafted
13 rules and 4 definitions, which were unanimously
accepted without (alteration. (This disposes oi
“Ex-E.’s” idea that the rules were the result of
compromise between enthusiasts of rival codes.) In
this work Harrison was actuated by a desire to
found an original game that would be to Australia
what baseball is to U.S.A, and lacrosse is to
Canada. The present game is based on Harrison’s
13 rules, and for this reason the veteran is always
called the Father of Australian football.

South Aus. is sending an XVIII over to
Perth to see if Westralia can do any better at
home than it did in the mud at Adelaide. Mean-
while a second S.A. team takes on, in Adelaide, an
XVIII from Tasmania.
* * *
“Tuart”: Delegates from four States de-
cided in Melbourne last week to send 40 Australians
to Paris for the 1924 Olympic Games, or know the
reason why. The team, as planned, is to include
oarsmen, swimmers, cyclists, tennis-players, boxers,
wrestlers, weight-lifters and track athletes, ranging
from the sprinter to the Marathon runner. For my
part, I would cut the wrestlers and weight-lifters
out. Australians are not keen on these rather dreary
pastimes, and the best of our mat-wrigglers and iron-
shifters wouldn’t have a ghost of a chance with the
Continental champions. Again, no mention is made
in the plans and specifications of Tasmania or West-
ralia. The Speck owns some very decent boxers and
distance runners and, judging by his times, Ilantke,
of W.A., was the best schoolboy athlete racing in
Australia last year. Provision should certainly be
made for both States to come in. Of the £lO,OOO
required to finance the tour, £l3BO has been sub-
scribed, £BOO by South Australia. The S.A. dele-
gates suggested at the conference that the Murray
Bridge crew should be chosen to go to Paris, but this
was rejected, as also was an ingenuous proposition that
the Murray Bridgers should be asked to keep fit.
They, of course, are sure to be invited to go. So are
. Carr, Hunt and Austen, among the athletes;
Beaurepaire and Charlton, the swimmers; Dempsey,
Broadbent and Munro, the cyclists; Brancourt, the
boxer; and, of the racquet-wielders, Patterson, And-
erson, O’Hara Wood, Mrs. Molesworth and Miss
Boyd—should it be decided to send ladies. Then there
are Baynes and Bull, the scullers, both of whom
should certainly be sent. It reads like a first-class
team.
*' * * *
The Kangaroo’s tail was well up at the new
Wembley Stadium, when Carr, Rowling, MacMillan
and Gale took part in the ex-servicemen’s sports.
Carr won the 220yds.—an event open to all members
of the B.E.F. and kindred forces—in 22 l-ssec., and
Gale was third. The Australians also annexed the
mile relay (880, 440, 220 and 220 yds.) in 3min.
40 3-ssec. The world’s record for a relay run on that
plan is 3min. 31 3-ssec.,\but the Diggers’ time was
pretty good considering that MacMillan, their half-
miler, hasn’t yet struck forfn.
* *
Melbourne judges of the heehand-toe busi-
ness have formed a high opinion of Ernie Austen. In
a contest advertised as the Australian seven-mile
championship, although it hasn’t been officially re-
cognised, the Sydney walker triumphed over ail
opposition, his time of 55min. ;44 2-ssec. on moist
earth cut up by passing feet ‘being only a little
over a minute behind W. Murray’s Victorian and
Australian record. Murray, now a veteran, struggled
into third place, the 18-year-old Dowling getting
second in 57min. 25 l-ssec. The youngster mav
never be a Frigerio, but he will improve.

There were 62 competitors for the Yours-
and-Mine Cup, a three-mile road-race promoted by
the N. S. Wales A. A. A. H. Swinbourne (lmin.
25sec.) was first home from T. O’Brien (2min.
15sec.) and L. Tutt' (lmin. 30sec;). The winner, a
younger brother of B. Swinbourne, of the Botany
cross-country team, ran the threb miles in 16min.
34sec., but fastest time was recorded by 11. Hayden
(Botany), who covered the journey in iSmin. 50see.
STRICTLY MODERATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The terms demanded by Sydney footballers for
signing on- with English League clubs were £5OO
to £lOOO down, a substantial weekly wage, travel-
ling exes, out and home, and remunerative employ-
ment off the field. In England the opinion is ex-
pressed that it is just as wed the two years’ resi-
dential qualification has been re-imposed.
So it’s off! Well, that’s tough,
It can’t be denied ;
And injury enough
Without insult beside,
Yet the blighters are saying we opened our mouths
too infernally wide.
Do they reckon we’d go
For a song o’er the main
To the land of the snow
And the slush and the rain,
We champions of Glebe and of Newtown, we idols
of sunny Balmain?
If legs they require
And sinews and thews,
Well, ours are for hire.
But we flatly refuse
To bite at a beggarly pittance or come at inadequate
screws.
Here are forwards and backs
That like lightning would leap
Through Lancashire packs,
Yet they gammon it’s steep
A thousand or so for a sign-on! Why, strike me
magenta ! it’s cheap.
For the takings would swell
At the gates, I’ll be bound,
And the Yorkshiremen’s yell
Of applause would resound
When a Sydney top-notcher was sprinting the ball
behind goal-posts to ground.
It’s for hire, if they like,
Our brawn and our beef,
But ’twould give us the spike
And we’d almost as lief
Go to work as take less for our talents than a
cricketing pro. like O’Keeffe.
A tenner a nob
They should weekly allow,
Plus a lucrative job
Off the field —and a thou. —
And exes. Who calls that excessive, he can’t be a
sport— he’s a cow.

WITH DODBE BROTHERS POWER PLANT
Truck owners can stop an enormous waste by
eliminating dead weight—by reducing loads as
nearly as possible to actual pay loads.
Graham Brothers Truck is built to meet this urgent
necessity for greater efficiency in hauling.
It is light—considerably lighter than the average
truck of equal rating. It is sturdy because it is
built of materials selected for quality rather than
bulk.
It is scientifically designed to save the owner money,
both in his initial investment and in his operating
costs—and the records prove emphatically that
it does.

THE INKY WAY.
Influenza has claimed Brisbane journalist B. il.
(“Rattler”) Brown, sporting writer, handicapper and
father of weekly newspapers that never managed fo
grow up.
“Chris”: R. W. Campbell, writer of “Private
Spud Tamson” and other tales, is back in Maori-
land looking for fresh material. He was on the
Auckland Herald staff a couple of years before the
war, through which he served as a captain in the
Royal Scottish Fusiliers. Originally he was in the
Black Watch.
“The Deacon” : The Western Suburbs Advertiser
a Sydney suburban weeklet, founded by George Wat-
son over 40 years ago, wrote its ' own obituary
notice the other day. A smart young rival, the
Aeroplane, delivered free at every door over a
large area, caught the eyes of the advertisers, and
the time being ripe, the old rag consented to be
absorbed.
“Tarago” : It isn’t always the comp.’s fault, or the
reader’s either. The line should have been:—
“Vermin are very thick in our Shire.”
Actually it read: —
“Vermin are very thick in our Shirt.”
The way our editor went on about it was disgraceful.
“T. 0.1.”: Spencer Groves, who ran the Times
at I’umut (N.S.W.) for half a century, died a few
days back at 70. He also owned the Adelong
Argus. For a country-paper proprietor he had ideas.
When I was in Tumut —it was years ago—he would
not deliver his paper at a pub. If Bung wanted
tiie Times he had to send for it. A widow and
eight daughters survive him.
“Arabe”: \ ietoria has a little Eatanswill of its
own in the town of Sale, where there are two bi-
weeklies. This is how one of them began its new
ecliimn the other morning:—
“A great critic is our local contemporary! It
is always telling those people who read it of the
failure of others to subscribe to different objects.
Perhaps it will tell its readers whether it has given
1110 towards the latest appeal for the soldiers'
memorial, like the owners of this paper have done.”
“Adelaide”: The dailies here are gleefully con-
trasting their reduction from 2d. to lid. with the
reverse process in London, where the' Times and
Daily Telegraph have, by mutual agreement, put
themselves up from lid. to 2d., which is also the
price of the leading provincial dailies. “The price
was reduced to lid.,” says the Times, “rather in the
hope that prices would come down than because they
had actually done so; and 'after more than a year’s
experience it has become quite clear that under pre-
sent conditions lid. is not an economic price.”
“Wart”: A dozen of Tasmanian writers, tired of
being told by the local papers that they should con-
sider themselves well paid by seeing their names in
print, assembled the other day at Launceston and
laid the foundations of a Tasmania Writers’ Guild.
Among the objectives are fair payment, duty on
American fiction and magazines and syndicated mat-
ter, and better publishing conditions. A blanch is
to be formed in Hobart, and the movement will
presently be linked up with the mainland one.
“Pollio”: “Stellsby” need lose no sleep over pups
allegedly sold to W. H. Ifould or the Federal
Government (B. 28/6/’23). The Palliser log has
always been known; it has never been out of the
possession of the Hudson family, and extracts from
it were printed in 1893 in the first volume of .he
Historical Records of N.S.W. (pp. 289-298). What
the Federal Government recently bought is not a log
at all; it is Cook’s personal journal, oully known
previously in copies (Wood discusses the whole
thing in his “Discovery of Australia”), and its
authenticity is indisputable.
“D.F.”: Australia has several first poets. Per-
haps the same is true of dramatists. But David
Burn seems to have claims to the title, for he
included several plays in his “Verses and Fugitive
Pieces” published in 1842. It does not appear that
they were ever acted; and certainly they are not
good. Burn came to Tasmania in 1825, following
his mother, Mrs. Jaeobina Burn, who had arrived
in 1820 and received a grant of land at Hamilton.
He followed sheepfarming till he was starved out
in 1843, after which he worked on newspapers in
Sydney and Auckland.
“Skyrider”: Re The Bulletin’s Furthest North
Back in 1904 I spent a winter in the Magdalen
Islands, a little group some 60 miles long in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence (Canada). My job was teach-
ing young islanders for “five per,” and the winter
was the longest and dreariest I have ever lived
through, for all traffic between the islands and Nova
Scotia ceases as soon as the first ice makes. I was
so stuck for reading matter in the long evenings
that I welcomed the suggestion that I should look
up “Hermit McPhaill,” an old fisherman who lived
on North Point, a dreary, windswept cape a couple
of miles away. “He got a box of books from a
wreck once,” said my informant; so I trudged
through the snow to the hermitage .and found the
ancient sitting over the fire. “They books?” he
assented - when I told him my errand, and forthwith
dragged out an old chest lull of what was (to me)
priceless literaturet After going through some
strata of Dickens, Thackeray and Scott, I caught
sight of a red cover. “Man,” I gasped, “here’s a
Bulletin ! All the way from Sydney.” “Maybe,”
he said, “maybe. And where’s Sydney?” The
box had been washed ashore from a wreck year
and years before.
“Sydolt” from North China:—
A par in my latest “Bully” re the proposed demo-
lition of Adelphi-terrace—that famous residentai
area of London between the Strand and the Embank-
ment, a spot beloved b.y wandering Aussies on leave
—-recalled pleasant memories to the writer, at pre-
sent sitting on the Great Wall of China. In the
war years the little Carlyle Society had its room*
there, and so had other groups of enthusiasts. It
also housed many big names, from Whisky down
or up to Genius. De.var had a flat on the Terrace
which looked across to the sluggish Thames. Bern;
ard Shaw parked his energetic brain in the Adelph)
and the writer found his garage by being invitee
up the stairs of a house whose ground floor accom-
modated the Nation. Round the corner there was
that old battler Grien, the Londonised Dutchman
whose dramatic criticisms have been the envy of
the youngsters for years. Grien and Frank Rutter,
the art authority, were striving to infuse life into a
little mag. called Art and Drama, 1 think it
was. Then there was delightful J. M. Barrie, who
had a flat near Heinemann the publisher. Barrie
and Shaw were probably the greatest contrast i»
mentality and physique that the Adelphi held at the
time. Granville Barker’s soothing flat did not Mold
its owner when I was invited up one night by one oi
Barker’s friends who had the run of the place. The
O. P. Club was hard by, and many a Dickens ghost
haunted the old archways that ran down from Dnke-
fitrect and tunnelled themselves out to the Embank-
ment.
SONNET OF SOUP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is no place in lyrical poetry for some of
the commonplaces of life, as, for instance, ‘mulliga-
tawny soup.’ ” — Projessoi■ Walter de la Mare.
How balefully the critic’s arrow flies
From Indigestion’s envenomed quiver.
Wryly he sneers at Soup; a gelid shiver
Speeds down his spine; hateful to him are Pies
Of Perigord, or jellied ecstasies
From Melton Mowbray; loathed e’en the liver
Of some choice poulet, or a luscious sliver
From a Plump Piglet, darling of the sties.
He shall not libel thee, Fierce Queen of Soups,
Without a champion to uphold thy fame.
Not we of Consommes the puling dupes,
But ardent lovers of thy kiss of flame!
Long may he burn, beset by stokers brawny,
Who shuns thy golden fire, Mulligatawny.

If The Cat and the Canary” was expected
to send thrills and shudders through a
first-night audience at Melbourne Royal it
missed badly. A few shrieks of laughter
were incited by its artless horrors, but the
mystery which began with the fatal kid-
napping of a family solicitor by an unac-
countable creature who did his dirty work
trom an unaccountable bookcase, and which
was deepened by an apparition in the
library where the doomed solicitor had read a
-O-year-old will on the stroke of midnight-
well, the laborious thing was treated as a poor
I*?, e / rorn the outset. The next act, wherein
all the characters in turn called to see the
new-made heiress in her bedroom, as though
girls bedrooms were common property, con-
tained so much pifflesome dialogue that the
dropping in of the lawyer’s corpse from a
sliding panel was hailed by the audience as
a welcome intrusion. From end to end “The
Cat and the Canary” is pre-eminently silly.
The effort to throw suspicion on the wrong
people, noticeable long ago in “The Thir-
Clmn'” and glaringly obvious in
The Rat, is wasted in this case. Every-
body knows now that these Yankee spoof
dramas throw false scents about regardless
of probability, and then produce a solution
of the mystery regardless of possibYity.
Aothing is more ridiculous than the “ex-
planation.” The comic relief is trivial stuff,
and the solution of the mystery is yards be-
neath contempt. The performance can be
partly forgiven on account of the poverty of
the play : it would be impossible for Miss
Muriel Martin-Harvey, for instance, to put
much air of realism into the part of the
young woman who goes to bed in her antique
necklace for the purpose of having it un-
clasped from her neck by a fiend who lurks
behind panels when insane, and offers con-
solation _to his victims when otherwise,
beveral imported mummers want force and
finish. Leslie ictor is rather entertaining
as a latecomer who practises medicine, and
makes a careful display of clawlike hands,
m order to get himself mistaken for an
alleged wandering lunatic whose hands are
said to answer to that description.

At Melbourne King’s the smile of Harry
Lauder is the same invitation to join in that
ever it was. A lot of Lauder, to be sure, is
just as it used to be in previous years, but
a lot of his quaint personality is not too
much. His old wheezes were good wheezes,
and his earlier melodies have retained their
bright Lauderian color better than his natu-

voice lias retained its richness.
And Ins art is as ripe as the dear old politi-
cal time which never comes. Lauder, as
of old, can shake his stick at all his imitators,
and his support is at least different to its
predecessors. Meanwhile the advt. reminds
the world that Irene Vanbrugh and Bouei-
cault will start a season of high-class comedy
at the King’s the first Saturday in August.
“Rockets,” having gone up with a whiz at
Melbourne Palace, threatens to remain in
the local heavens for as long as the man-
agement can let it. As a revue it beats this
country’s record. A sustained gaiety about
it is contagious and delightful. Old gags
are served up with new sauce. Borrowed
ideas are reminders of scenes one is glad to
be reminded of, as when Toots Pounds
emerges from a wedding-cake like Fifi in
“The Belle of New York,” or the boy at the
Zoo wants to “see the giraffe” with the per-
tinacity of the nasty kid in “The Whip”
who wanted to see Charley Peace. The
Pounds Sisters and Charles Austin are going
to be mighty popular in Melbourne before
winter goes, and the rest of the airy enter-
tainment is in for what used to be called a
full measure of public esteem.
* * :I: St
“Tangerine,” at Melbourne Princess’s,
continues to be difficult to place among musi-
cal frivolities with plots to them. Perhaps
there is_ not exactly a plot to “Tangerine,”
though it presents an excuse for one. But
undoubtedly it defies conventionality in the
bright blue wig of a dancer on the island
where husbands do the washing and women
keep the accounts. Also it earns respect for
the King’s custom of giving each of his
wives her appointed day of the week.
Polygamy, harmoniously carried out, would
associate each wife with a particular menu,
and demand certain characteristics of a
turkey-and-ham bride that would be unaccept-
able in a spouse who helped hubby with his
weekly dish of tripe.
“Sybil” has lost no musical importance since
Cecil Bradley came to the rescue at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s. In a measure the arrival
of the Grand Duchess lifts things, as the
timely advent of the Grand Duke had done,
but it doesn’t change the key of the narra-
tive. Claude Flemming’s unavailing pursuit
of Gladys Moncrieff and the incidental dis-
satisfaction of Chisholm is rather protracted.
The plot moves too slowly, while the hard-
working efforts of the broad comedians almost
move one to tears.
Melbourne Majestic devotes all its adjec-
tives this week to a stupendous pro-
duction of “Theodora,” arranged by one of
the pontificos of the Italian film business.
Rita Jolivet is the wicked minx of the name-
part, but she is extinguished in pictorial in-
terest by the horde of human sundries and
a team of hungry lions that gets an un-
paralleled meal at her command. Many
other crowded features are cleverly depicted,
but the eye, grown weary of mere Isob-
spectacles, declines to be staggered by these
.events. Hoyt’s have Gloria Swanson’s heart-
melting smile in full working order in “My
American Wife,” a tousled racing drammer
with an Argentine millionaire - in a promi-
nent position. Edward (“Hoot”) Gibson
is the other Hoyt sensation : he is a social
purifier and sweetstuff connoisseur in the
freight-train mystery, “Kindled Courage.”
Slim Mae Murray cuts a fine figure in “Fas-
cination” at the Melba. Another shot in
the campaign against bad husbands has just
been fired at the Britannia. It is of Big
Bertha calibre, and is badly entitled “A
Wife’s Awakening.”
* * *
A little show worth encouraging:—
People who want to encourage a minor talent in
an inexpensive way should make an inspection of Miss
Elsie Barlow’s water-colors at the Queen’s Hall, Mel-
bourne. There is nothing very distinguished about
the productions, but they are mostly low-priced, and
give one pleasant news about the state of the bush, sea
and sky at unpretentious times of day. A set of studies
showing the use Miss Barlow made of the remarkable
snowfall at Sassafras (Vic.) last year are nicely
painted, if they are unvarying in their insistence on
the quantity of the snow. An uncatalogued view of
Lake Wendouree in winter is above her average
achievement; so is “The Road to Donna Buang,’’ an
unaffected impression of a thin track, tall trees and
promiscuous leafage. A sand dune at Cape Wooiamai
is the most taking of her seascapes. Her efforts to
advertise the alleged chanps of Rhyl are less satis-
factory, and her black-ami-whites are wanting in
draughtsmanship.
* * * *
“Mary” still offers fair-to-middling melody
and brisk toe-whirling at Sydney Majesty’s.
There is a pleasant animation about
the piece that carries off the shallow-
ness of the plot and the lack of sparkle in
the dialogue, and the daintiness and dexterity
of various pairs of flashing limbs are calcu-
lated to make anyone forget quite a lot of
troubles.

“Bulldog Drummond” pursues the tenor
of his adventurous way at Sydney Grand
Opera House. Virtue in the person of the
debonair G. H. Mulcaster lands a winner in
an easy canter, and villainy as portrayed by
George Night gets it in the neck ; Eve Gray
is as feminine as ivy. and Sylvia Shaw as

a prologue, in which Allan Priora and
soprano Claire Godley engage in song, and a
ballet twirls 16 attractive legs. At the

N’Yark’s “strong-farm” brigade, to the dis-
comfort of the screen-villain. Furthermore,
Charles . Ray is imparting useful tips to
novices in the adolescent heart-burning divi-
sion. At the Strand, down the same tram-
track, Gloria Swanson, in a gown created
from 2999 ermine tails, is taking an active
part in the politics of a South American
monarchless region. Incidentally, her make-
believe husband prefers the ponies. At the
Globe a Hall Caine best-seller is opening
the eyes of the godly to sins of the world—•
especially theatrical managers’. Will Rogers
is extracting sniffs and giggles from the
Lyric’s customers as “A Poor Relation.”
* * * *
After a visit to an etchers’ show:—
Bluff plays a big part in what is written and
said etching by etchers; consequently it is
not surprising to find bluff strongly in evidence in
many of the exhibits at the third annual exhibition
b.V Sydney Painter-Etchers Society. AVith all the
difficulties etching presents to the serious artist, it
is probably the easiest of all mediums through which
the amateur may gain serious consideration for his
frail efforts; little ability and less .experience, when
aided by the softening influence of surface ink on
the plate, are necessary to turn a weak drawing
into what seems at first glance attractive art.
Added to this_ is its greater value as a money-
maker—3o to 60 prints at two to ten guineas eaeli
whereas the same amount of work on canvas migk
not sell at seven! These doubtless are the two
main reasons why the list of Australian etchers is
growing. The development of appreciation for in-
different etching means eventually a corresponding
shrinkage of appreciation for better art in less
limited mediums; and thus the increasing number
of private etching factories constitutes a feal menace
to the sound growth of Australian art, and the One
corrective is a more critical attitude On the part of
our galleries and collectors. An etching’ gains iio
artistic value from the mere fact that it is acid-
bitten Or scratched on copper or zinc and printed
and autographed by the artist personally; Hot do
the accidental effects of the process matter twopence.
Its Value is wholly dependent on the degree of per-
fection it attains in the two elements with Which
it is able to deal—drawing and tone. It should be
judged on exactly the same basis as a pen or wash
drawing, Some of the work by a half-dozert local
exhibitors stand this test, and so do most of the

Jamwood”: Albert Chevalier is dead in
Condon at 62. There have been few more
versatile characters. Though his father was
k rench and his mother Welsh he became the
acknowledged king of the coster comedians
who were all the rage on the ’alls in the earlv
’nineties. ’Arry Rickards, himself a pretty
good delineator of the singing coster, used to
speak of Chevalier iu terms of rapture, but
could never induce him to come to Australia.
" hen the coster fashion had been exhausted
CONDITIONALLY.
HE (a social bore) : "May I have this next
dance?”
SHE: “ Certainly—if you can find someone to
be your partner.”
Chevalier returned to the legitimate, where
he had worked with the Bancrofts, the Iven-
dals and John Hare. Barrie engaged him to
Play Pantaloon in the play of that name,
and other Chevalier parts were James Hogg
r^ ns Society” and Eccles in
Caste. The man also w r rote a dozen plays,
a book of reminiscences and any number of
songs and sketches, and his acting in a
filmed version of “My Old Dutch,” which
Arthur Shirley helped him to write was
superior to that of any Yankee mime I have
ever seen. But he took to the pitchers too
late.
10-2-4 : Albert Chevalier was the first
music-hali comedian to present the Londoner
ot the slums as a human being. The East
Ender had previously been simwn to the
''est as a roaring, impossibility,
typified for years after Chevalier’s rise bv
such singers as Harry Randall in ballads of
the type of “Ours Is an ’Appy Little ’Ome” :
Ours is an ’appy little ’ome!
I wash I vvuz a kipper in the foam 1 *
1 here s no knocker on the door •
No carpit on the floor.
I Fortissimo . Head back and eyes closed.]
Ours is an ’appy little ’ome!
Chevalier wrote the words and music of
nearly all his songs, and anyone who troubles
with m ?b re he score 1 of ’ sa y- “My Old Dutch”
with the more plaintive of Moskowski’s
Spanish Dances may get a hint as to the
source of his inspiration. All his best songs
were in a minor key as the best of those of
V s 11 /!' flt ® l ,'’ (^ us Bie n, were. They expressed
t e tiue Cockney—a philosophic humorist
keeping a stiff upper lip in despite of pov-
erty, sordid hideousness, fogs, rotten weather
and no prospect of a ris e in life. “If it
wasn’t for the ’ouses in between” Elen
used to smg, stressing, with a queer kind of
lugubrious cheeriness, the beauties of nature
that were relatively close to his home:—•
Wiv’ a ladder an’ some glarses
ou see to ’Ackney Marshes
If it wasn t for the ’ouses in between.
Chevalier belonged to the golden age of what
is now known as vaudeville, an age that
demanded either melody or character-acting
from its comic singers, and was often offered
both He was artist enoiigh to have had his
end hastened by the spectacle of the rag-time
coons in top-hats who have so largely sun-
planted his school. J y
O.K. : Just dead Cyril Mackay had only
one enemy himself. He was a newcomer
tO -^ U^ a \ a w^en “The Squavy Man” arrived
with Charles Waldron and Ola Jane Hum-
phrey Cyril played in that utterly Ameri-
Mso in “The Virginian” and
•lhe Christian,” which followed. His
highly melodramatic mannerism—his effec-
tively theatrical turn of the eyes—in early
Australian appearances hardly prepared one
tor his natural impersonation of a harmless
Cockney cad in “An Englishman’s Home,”
which was about th e most memorable thiug
he did during his Australian life. He was
too apt to be loud and savage in his manner
£ One thinks of him as the lover
ot Bianca in “Taming of the Shrew,” who
used to advise his rival (with the reed in-
strument) to “Spit in it, man; spit in it!”
and_ lay an unnecessary emphasis on tlie
spit.”
“Norbell” farewells an old friend :
Buried at Waverley (N.S.W.) on Saturday, Harry
Leston comedian, teacher of elocution and goods
fellow. In his day Leston was associated with many 5
fine Australian shows. He was the Chinaman in
Bland Holt’s “The New Babylon,” in ’Bl, at the
Theatre Royal, Melbourne, and later supported the
Polks at the old Princess’s. He was in the original
production of George Darrell’s “The Sunny South,”
at Melbourne Opera House in March ’B3, with Essie
Jenyns, the Holloways and a strong cast, and
comeded in several of the Triumvirate’s pantos, in
the ’eighties. With Alfred Dampier he supported
Miss Jeffries Lewis in “Notre Dame” and other
dramas. Later he was comedian in Dampier’s own
co. for many years, and was the original Trooper
Maginnis in “Robbery Under Arms.” Old play-
goers gratefully remember his work as Gaspard Cade-
rousse in “Monte Cristo” ; Gustavus Jones in “The
Green Lanes of England” ; Rev. Mr. Meekin in “For
the Term of His Natural Life”; and Bob Millett in
The World Against Her.” He was low comedian
in Rignold’s production of “My Jack” at Sydney
Majesty’s in ’94, and a little later lie was Fix the
detective in Williamson and Musgrove’s elaborate
production of “Round the World in 60 Days,” at
Sydney Lyceum, in association with Robert Court-
neidge, Edward Sass and Henrietta Watson. He
played much in Shakspeare, too, and was a noted
clown in “As You Like It.” He was 72 when the
curtain fell.
“Second Murderer”: Many actor-managers
of the old school were terrible fellows. At
rehearsal they loved to swoop on the small-
part men, and lash them with a vitriolic
tongue, growing more autocratic and venom-
ous when the Immortal was on tap. There
is a tradition that W. H. Hoskins, the Shaks-
pearean mummer-authority in Australia, used
to become hysterical, and tear his hair and
weep over his actors’ efforts. He had a
trick, too, of stamping on the stage and in-
voking the Bard himself. “Come up Bill!”
he would shriek—“ Come up and listen to
’em murdering you !” Nowadays more polite
methods obtain. I saw Allan Wilkie conduct
a rehearsal of “King John” at the Palace,
bydney, and only once did he show a little
impatience. The King Philip of the piece
was too languid for Wilkie’s liking. “For
Heaven’s sake,” he implored, “put a little
ginger into it! Remember you’re playing the
King—not the two of diamonds!”
“Lond.”: London audiences are getting
quite skilful at barracking. Clara Butt and
Marie Tempest have both tasted it lately.
When Marie returned in a poor play, she was
told with great distinctness, when she
thanked the audience for the welcome given
her, that it was for herself alone. And now
Clara, singing at an orchestral concert, and
giving a whole bunch of encores, was told :
"We want to hear the orchestra.” The critic
h ranees Toye thinks the good work should
spread:—
Uur popular artists are thoroughly spoilt; they
expect applause as a matter of course, and the Eng-
lish public are so polite that they give it mechani-
cally.
It is equally pertinent to Australia.
"Thersites”: I also have seen "East
Lynne” piayed by five people (B. 12/7/’23).
At Mildura (Vic.), in loot), a small touinng
gang of mummers put in a successful week,
aud finished the season with "East Lynne”
as a "benefit” to the local hospital. Several
members of the co. were unfamiliar with the
old standby, and it was finally decided to
perpetrate the drama with three ladies and
two men. Victor Prince, who had never met
the play before, was Au'chibald Carlyle and
Bullock; Norman Campbell was D.ll,
Richard Hare, Lord Mount Severn and Sir
, r antis Levi son; and Mrs. Campbell was
Lady Isabel. The two ladies were the
Barbara Hare and Cornelia Carlyle of the
occasion. There have been worse perform-
ances of “East Lynne”—the audience was
satisfied, and the hospital got a leg up.
FREE, GRATIS AND FOR NOTHING.
“I see you are presenting Shakspeare at your theatre
“ ‘Presenting’s’ right, laddie—house full of deadheads.”
“Pitt-Streeter”: No actresses nowadays,
says someone, like Nellie Stewart and Mrs
Brough of the old days. Well, I dunno.
i~las anything cleverer been seen on our
stages than Josie Melville’s performance of
? An ? what abou t Gladys Mon-
cnelt i J.Joesn t her work compare with the
best we have had—imported or otherwise?
liien, what price our movie stars —Enid
Bennett, Sylvia Bremer, Clyde Cook and
others ! And, lastly, where does Dot Brun-
ton come in?
“0.K.”: The talk about improper lack of
attire and want of behavior at so-called artists’
bals masques seems to justify the dictum of a
dull, puritanical male parent in a recent Aus-
trahan comedy by Mary Wilkinson produced in
Melbourne. When his daughter nails a study in
the nood to the parlor wall, and explains that
it is Art, the old man remarks that they all
know what Art is—it’s an Excuse. These
bal masque “scandals” look very like a
triumph for the old man. The man in the
street has caught on to them as being suit-
able for humorous allusion. Last week
when an utterly unclothed man, lately from
a hospital, was seen walking on all fours
about the housetop of his dwelling in Drum-
mond-street (Melbourne), a passer-by re-
marked that the unclad stranger on the icv
F 11 J loase t°P must be “dressed for an artists’
ball.
~ A Melbourne evening journal pub-
hshed the other night a few epigrams, includ-
ing A play is like a cigar. If it is bad no
amount of puffing will make it draw; but if
it is good, everyone wants a box.” Who was
the father of that familiar witticisln —H
J. Byron or W. S. Gilbert? I think it was
Byron, the jester who. being worried on his
death-bed by his groom, with an anxious
inquiry as to whether he (the groom) should
give a sick carriage-horse a ball, answered-
"Oh, give him a ball, but don’t ask too many
people.”
“Whitehall”: I find it hard to swallow
"Tay Fays” yarn (B. 12/7/’23) about
Harry R.ckards shooting “violent language
at the ‘blawsted coward who frew that
brahn’ ” while he was reciting 'KinlWs
“Fay! Pay ! Fay!” In the first place
Harry did not speak with an East End’
accent. He could act the Cockney to per-
fection, but for normal social purposes he
was the typical heavy tragedian of melo-
drama. Secondly, he was a born showman
and as such abhorred the mere thought of
that worst of breaches from the showman’s
standpoint—abuse of the audience from the
stage. The humblest apology I ever re-
ceived in my life was from Harry at Syd-
ney Tivoli. I was one of a party in a box
who (inexcusably enough) laughed at the
antics of Mrs. Sims Reeves. The lady was
giving an imitation of her late husband’s
method of singing “Sally in Our Alley,’'
and, happening to notice our lack of appre-
ciation, stopped her song and rebuked us.
It shook Harry to his foundation, though
he knew none of us, and probably as a per-
former sympathised with the lady. Finally,
I got to know Rickard some years latex-’
and summed him up as the most even-tem-
pered handler of men and women I had ever
met.
“Fax”: The selec-
tion of “If Winter
Comes” in London—
unless it was ordered
before it was staged,
which is hardly pro-
bable —was a bad error
of judgment. It was
apparently due to the
delusion, which shouts
at the public on the
posters, that “the
world has read the
book.” But the world
has not read the book.
In this country only
a small proportion of
novel-readers sampled
it, and many must
have doubted whether
an interesting drama
could be made from
such a deliberately
odd-shaped story.
Theatrical speculators
who banked on the
popularity of the book
were profoundly igno-
rant of the sort of
popularity that earns
notoriety for a novel.
As far as I can re-
member the only Eng-
lish _ novel published
within 40 years which
has_ commanded a good
business notoriety in
Australia was “Tril-
by.” The world at
large knew the name
and sorbething of the
story of “Trilby,"
even as Australia
knows of “The Senti-
mental Bloke.” But
how many Australians
have heard of “If
Winter Comes” as com-
pared with the num-
ber acquainted with ‘“The Bloke”? One-
tenth, perhaps.

iulis the Strings,” is back at London Coli-
seum after a world-topr lasting 10 years.

Mo fiat daughter is quite grown up now.
per dad has written a companion-piece deai-
ing with the time when Bunty was still an
infant. He calls it “Susie Knots the
Strings.”
Caesar s Ghost” : Periodically a mummer
ailives who resurrects the old wheeze about
taking the audience outside and shouting him
a drink. It was new to me 20 years ago,
when I heard Val Yousden, the ventriloquist,
ten it, but I have read it at least 50 times
smce then. And Vousden gave the thing a
neat finish. After the drinks he found out
that the audience was the man who had
been engaged to take the money at the door.
. Second Murderer”: Touching the stage
journalist (B. 5/7/’23). You can always
identity him by his singular habit of pulling
out a notebook and jotting down —the pro-
ducer only knows what. They all do it;
now else could the audience guess what the?
J® re / I noticed this peculiarity the other
day m The Great Lover,” and have seen it
m scores of plays for the last 40 years. I
brst remarued the notebook habit in “Fati-
nitza, an opera bouffe in which Emelie Mel-
ville shone of yore (ah, me!). Armes Beau-
mont, the tenor of the piece, was a war-
correspondent, and made his first entrance
notebook in hand. “What do you find to
write about?” he was asked. “Well,” lie
eplied, I noticed a sentry stamping his feet
to warm himself. At once I cabled, 'The
-Turkish Army is in motion, and is taking
vigorous measures to counteract the rigors
of a winter campaign.’ ”
THE ARTIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His hair was long; the lambent glow
Of Art was in his eye;
He wore his neckcloth in a bow
No Philistine could tie.
His very socks, all seamed and shot
With neutral tints and wan,
Stamped him of that a;sthetic lot
Stretching from Zeuxis (is it not?)
Right down to ’Gustus John.
I thought of Turner, Whistler, too,
And Humphrey Jagenal,
And vaguely wondered if they knew
Enough, the whole illustrious crew,
To run an Artists’ Ball
Sans row's,
A decorous Artists’ Ball.
His fingers, white and sensitive,
A troubled brow' caressed.
He muttered that he needs must give
Committee meetings best.
To nerves, he said, as highly-strung
As harps af Eistedfodds,
The faintest note of difference flung
Prom off some brother-painter’s tongue
Became an insult dire that stung
Like flames and cut like rods.
Mimosa plants, his mien conveyed,
Were hardy things withal
Beside the souls of the brigade
That plied old Titian’s glorious trade,
And every now and then essayed
To run an Artists’ Ball
0.K.,
A proper Artists’ Ball.
The hues of all my Artist wore,
From veloured crown to sole,
Were blent, as ne’er I’ve seen before,
In one harmonious whole.
Yet, discord-torn, he paused to send
A malediction faint
On slurs that rankle, feuds that rend
And fancied slights that make a friend
A foe whene’er, for common end,
Foregather men who paint.
And that is w'hy I’d like to know
To life might we recall
Rubens and Michael Angelo,
Josh Reynolds, Raphael and Co.,
If their successors they could show,
W’ho bicker, sulk and brawl,
Some more artistic way to go
About an Artists’ Ball
(What ho!)
A Sydney Artists’ Ball.

Twelve Years’ Service and Still
Running Beautiful.
A New Zealand owner writes from Master-
ton :
“Would you be kind enough to let me know if
it is possible for me to purchase from your
firm a set of foot brake shoes and hand brake
shoes and drum lining for a Wolseley Car
13/16 1911 Model.
“I have had this car all these years, and this
Is the first time the brakes wanted lining, and
It still runs beautiful.
“If I can purchase these things, kindly
state price, and I will forward cheque straight
away.”

HOW IT IS BUILT.
To every man considering the pur-
chase of a car the answer to this
question, “How is the car built? is
vital. Satisfaction comes to the owner
of a Wolseley Car because it is built
to give efficient service for a long
period, withstand road shocks, elimi-
nate disappointment caused by
frequent breakages, and generate that
feeling of supreme confidence which
only a faithfully-built car can give.
Built of Vickers steel, specially made
to give maximium protection, and
stand the strain under all conditions,
the Wolseley features the highest
standard of English engineering skill,
thus ensuring power, endurance and
smooth running at all times.
The Wolseley Suspension is the finest suspension
ever embodied in a motor-car. The springs are so
tough and resilient that severe road shocks are
carried without danger of fracture. Further, the
shocks are not transmitted to the machinery or the
body of the car—thus the life of the car is increased
and maximum comfort assured.
Herein is the secret of Wolseley supremacy. Ask
your State dealer to give you a demonstration.

Convenience.
Only one fire to look after. Less trouble than
the ordinary room fire, and may be left un-
attended for hours at a time.
Cleanliness.
No ashes, soot, smoke or fumes inside the
house. No soiling or discoloration of furnish-
ings. [
Healthfulness.
Nothing is added to the air but warmth. No
unhealthy gases or vapors. The temperature
is like that of a bright Spring day in its fresh-
ness and comfort.
A Home Comfortably
Warmed in Every Corner.
N the majority of Australian homes the open
fire is accepted as the only means of artificial
heat within the reach of the average house-
holder, and its disadvantages and discomforts
are looked upon as the inevitable accompaniment
of winter.
The illustration given here shows the essentials of an
IDEAL Heating
installation as applied to modern dwellings. The system consists of
a boiler and supply pipes connected to radiators in every room
where warmth is required. The temperature of any room may be
raised or lowered at will, and a genial warmth is provided right
throughout the house.
Here are four definite reasons why you should have the “Ideal”
system of Hot-water Radiation installed in your home:—
Economy.
The amount of fuel usually burnt in one open
fireplace will heat four average rooms. For
an equal heating duty, electric radiators will
cost over 26 times as much, and gas-fires
(with flue) 1 1 times as much as “Ideal” Hot-
water Heating.
Send us a rough plan of your house for an approximate
estimate of cost. . We prepare Heating plans on tracings of
Architects, Builders or Plumbers. Write NOW to

E. Jacinth: Plow many new papers have

away....H.L. (Kangaroo Point): Feeble little point.

is bad.. ..Scherzando: No value.. . .W.P. (Garrick) 1
You haven’t made even fair use of your materials.
. ...F.J.Ii.: The plain story should make a short
article; the conversation and embroidery is poor stun.
.... Kat: The horse gallops to a whirling tune: —
Of all the horses north and south,
Be it a flush season or a drought,
The old brumby caught on the ranges of Pinfies'oar
Towers above tlfem all by far.
The same applies to horses east and West
Because he’s the daddie horse .and best.
He’s old but honest, and he's dear
To the children, far and near.
They know he’s the safest and best to ride,
And they love him-, do the children around the moun-
tain side,
Because the music from his unshod hoofs makes
them Wonder
When 3® trods the plain grass under.
•- - - Billy D.: No use in its present form.... Han-
ses* E.: Frail as the skeleton of a dream.... C.L.
((Kensington): “Darky” is a machine-made person....
11.8. (Pott’s Point) : Doesn’t punch us hard enough.

much of a yarn... .A.E.K.: The ape yarn misses the
mark.... Leznem: It moves like a hamstrung ele-
phant .... Stanley 0.: The old commonplaces....
J.R.M.: The “Queen” suffers from too much ordi-
nariness... ,P. A.S.: A shambling sort of yarn which
falls over its own feet and gets tangled in its gram-
mar.... E.R. (Paddington): Sorrowful effort after
mirth put into shocking verse.... D.E.C-.: Twittering
verse that is sometimes fair and sometimes very
bad... .Ernest N. Z.: So thin that we saw the next
competitor through its backbone.... Simla: Wooden
and creaky. . . .S.S.M.: Doesn’t get to anything worth
while... .A.C.Q.E.: Too many worn tags....Jum:
“E.D.’s” statement wasn’t a defence of the indenture
system : it was simply a rebuttal of the charge that
Kanakas were ever paid in kind... .E. 8.: Off our
beat. .. .J. Norman: He’s looking at his son’s photo-
graph, of course. Will that inane question never get
a rest?... .A.M.F.: Use a brush and comb on it.
The arguments are all right, but they’re all tangled,
and so lose force. .. .Hornswoggle: Too much like
Yankee film stuff... .Dardanus: Pretty awful, really.
. ...P.O’R.: Well enough done, but beastly un-
pleasant.... .Orion: Lightweight.... Xam : Not much
of a point, and you don’t make it a smooth journey
there... .M.E.V.: There is more music in the frog.
....Sadie Vanson: Verse very rugged and ideas
very thin. .. .Harold P.: Weli written, but can’t
you put a bit more into it?....J.W. (East Mel-
bourne) : As slight as Bruce’s acquaintance with
bowyangs. .. .C.J.S.: She is a pleasant cat, but not
exciting.... J.8.W.: Dreary narrative with a micro-
scopic point... .Myee: Poor as Binghi’s d0g....
K.A.J.: No use for that sort of thing.... Speranza:
Even for 1G years and a first attempt it isn’t good.
... .C.K. (Albury): What’s a “peeling challenge’'?
Anything to do with spuds ? f... Una R.: Misses, but
not by much. .. . Webfoot: “The Carpenter” must
go with his shavings... .Duncan C.: Doesn’t strike
us P.J.N.: Flutters feebly, and then expires....
Janies R.: There is no yarn there.. . .N.P.S.:
Nothing in it....Namoi: The verse is not well
enough done... .Stinging Nettle: You. can secure Brit-
ish copyright here, but American copyright can only
be got by publishing in the U.5.A... .Fettler: You
lose yourself in a forest of words... .W.M.W.: None
of sufficient interest for print. .. .S.A.W. (and others) .
Practicably impossible to deal with typewriting in
which ro space is left to poke a pen between the
lines. . . .W.A.: Your solemn truth must have a place:
Last winter I got the horrid ’flu,
Which made me cough and spit;
My doctor had it badly too,
But couldn’t get rid of it.
Yet he prescribed and took his fee
From my rather scanty pelf ;
He seemed an honest chap to me
Who couldn’t cure himself.
1 told my wife what he did,
And failed to shift his own;
We said “Ta ta” to my dear quid
With' an undertaker's moan.
....Gipsy K.: Written with some force; but there’s
an over-supply of ugly stories.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J. : “Garge” is too badly drawn to get through.
... . J.A.G.: And looks it. ... H.W.T.: Out again....
P.W.L.: Can do nothing with sketches in blue ink.
. ...M.J.: Pen-work too niggly; broaden 0ut....
A.J.W.: Drawing won’t' pass muster.... A.T.G.: Feeble
in manner and matter J.S.G.W.: You’ve produced
the most amazing hand to date... .M.W.: Not up.
. ...W.G.: Drawing shows some promise: but the
gag is as weak as watered ginger-beer... .L.J.F.:
Not a hope... .Edina: All below the mark. Can find
no trace of your boxer C.O’K.: Pencil sketches
no use except as suggestions; and these don’t suggest
anything worth while G.H.: A prehistoric tailor
got off that joke, and it’s been overworked ever since.
“St. H”: “D.F.” (B. 28/6/’23) refers to
Rooty Hill as having derived its name from
“ruti,” the Hindustani word for bread. I
suggest as much more probable that the
patronymic of Captain Thomas Rooty, who
lived on Bungarribee Estate in the time of
Governor Macquarie, is preserved in the
name. The captain’s old nouse still stands
a little distance from Rooty Hill station;
a large number of convicts were once kept
there.

Nature intended every
•woman to have beautiful
hair—hair that is soft and
silky to touch.
This is a message to women
•who wish to keep this
beauty or who would
restore it.
Are you giving your hair
the right treatment ?
If your hair is not what you want
it to be, Hart to-day to learn the best
way to beautify it and preserve it .
There is an oil in the scalp, secreted by th'*
glands of the hair, called sebum. It is nature o
beautifier, the natural oil which gives your hair
beauty and lustre.
But like all skin secretions, its flow is often
excessive. The effect of this excess is to
clog the roots of the hair and to stop the
normal flow of this natural oil. The hair
becomes dry and brittle, and sometimes full of
dandruff. The accumulated oil quickly decomposes,
forming fatty acids which inflame the scalp, burn
away the tissue, and if left unattended to, generally
kill the hair roots.
To correct the trouble, the first step is the same as
with any skin surface. Remove the surplus secretion.
Dissolve it, clear it from your scalp in a way that will
not harm the delicate tissues.
In PALMOLIVE SHAMPOO we believe we have
developed a perfect complement to sebum. Palmolive
Shampoo contains the oils of the palm and the olive.
Their profuse, mild but penetrating lather softens the scalp and
reaches every root and hair cell. It dislodges and dissolves the
dandruff scales. It leaves the scalp and hair free to function
healthfully, thus encouraging the normal flow of sebum— the
natural oil, enabling it to feed and to dress the hair with
its own incomparable lustre.
Palmolive Shampoo sells everywhere . If you have
any difficulty in obtaining it please write direct to us.

“Wessel”: If Captain Cook had looked a
little more closely at Possession Island, near
Cape York, when he hoisted the British ting
on it and took formal possession of eastern
Australia, Vic. and N. S. Wales might nowa-
days be the neglected Southern Territory of
a Commonwealth governed from Somerset
or Thursday Island. In 1895 J. T. Embley
discovered gold-bearing quartz practically in
the place where Cook had planted his flag-
pole, and it was worked for some years. If
Cook had spotted the gold, how different
might the history of Australia have been!
“Patiti”: A recent par. about the Gisborne
(M.L.) purchase of two horses at Is. each re-
minds me of a sheep deal near Timaru some
years ago. Tom Dillon bid 2s. 6d., and got
an old ram knocked down to him. He put his
purchase in his cart and shore him in the
vehicle on his homeward journey. Passing a
woolworks lie sold the fleece for 4s. 6d. He
put the old pure merino into a paddock with
his 24 ewes for the night, and next morning
sold him to a neighbor for £l. Some time
later Dillon sold 31 lambs at 265. each, and
hung on to one that looked most like its
“cheap” old dad.
* * * *
“Chris”: Beer was first brewed in Maori-
land in November, 1791, when George Van-
couver, the English navigator, called in at
Dusky Sound. There were no hops, but
\ ancouver found an ingredient that answered
his purpose in the manuka shrub. In the
account of his voyage he waxes enthusiastic
about the good effect which a fresh fish and
spruce beer diet had on his crew. It’s a far
cry from that day to the present in Maori-
land, with its militant prohibition movement
and its brewers’ counter-attack in the sfiape
of a £1,500,000 combine now in the flotation
stage.
“L. Ree”: Re the unifying of railway
gauges. The head of the biggest rolling-
stock making firm in the Empire was in
Australia in 1913. Asked by a well-known
politician for his opinion on the subject he
said that he had no wish to butt into con-
tentious politics, but, speaking for loco-
builders, “we would give anything for a sft.
3in. gauge. We’re up against the question
of boiler power. The boiler is down on the
moving gear now, and we can’t put it any
lower. With the modern demand for higher
speed we can’t put it any higher and take
the curves with safety. The difference be-
tween 4ft. 81in. and sft. Sin. would help us
a lot.”
“Aerial”: The Diplex (B. 21/6/’23) has
been in use many years on circuits, such as
race-lines, where there is a large volume of
telegraph traffic in one direction. About 35
years ago the Duplex, an arrangement which
permits two streams of messages, one each
way, to pass over a single wire, was intro-
duced. The two-ways idea wasn’t much
advantage where practically all the traffic
went one way, and the Diplex came along.
Soon afterwards the Quadruplex system en-
abled two streams of telegrams to flow in
each direction over one wire. The messages
never mix. Now the Yanks pour up to 40
streams of messages and half-a-dozen tele-
phone conversations over a single wire.

“Te Babarantiko” : Half the trouble aris-
ing from the dearth of apprentices is due
to the unconscionable period of most appren-
ticeships. I have seen more Sydney factories,
large and small, than most men, and my im-
pression is that the majority of the boys,
during the opening years of their apprentice-
ship, are merely messengers; they don’t be-
gin to learn the technicalities of their trade
till the last year or so of their indenture.
Some Repat. trainees are certainly doing
well after comparatively brief tuition. I
have seen returned men trained by Ernest
G. B. Millar, while chief engineer of the
English Electric Co. of Australia at Clyde
—and the work was transformer construe-
tion, until then never attempted in Australia
—turning out work every bit as good as that
of men of long apprenticeship and training.
It returned soldiers are amenable to inten-
sive trade-training, why not other adults,
despite union opposition?
* * * *
“Mountain Ash”: Warburton, 45 miles
from Melbourne, is the main sawmilling
centre of Victoria; about 40 mills are cut-
ting, and their annual production of hard-
wood is some 60,000,000 super feet; there
are also seasoning works, turning out hard-
wood linings, floorings and weatherboards. It
has been found necessary to alter and enlarge
the State school, and many months ago Alec
Peacock, Minster for a Number of Things,
arrived, and unloaded the usual platitudes
about what a magnificent asset we had in
our forests, and how we should all be good
Australians and support our own country.
He announced, amidst cheers, that the Gov-
ernment would put the school extension in
hand immediately. Two weeks back the
carpenters started. And now the covering
for the walls and floors of the new school-
room has come—Baltic flooring and Baltic
weatherboards! That’s Peacock’s way of
supporting Australian industry in a timber
township.

“Mendelian’s” forecast and deduction:
It is highly probable that Britain’s inability to
feed herself may be overcome by science within a
very few years. At Cambridge University biologists
working on Mendelian lines are making investiga-
tions that hold out hopes of the animal and plant
fruitfulness of Britain being increased at least
sevenfold. Long before the war a Cambridge pro-
fessor got busy on the problem of improving on the
Cold Country’s smut- and rust-ridden wheats. It is
claimed that he has already succeeded in producing
a smut- and rust-proof wheat that goes 40 bushels
to the acre. And that is only one item. With high-
priced Squires and low-priced Hodges, the soil of
Britain and the products thereof have long lacked
the application of science. The famine scare of the
war and the heavy taxation bearing on the idle
arable areas are tending to give fat acres with a
regular rainfall their chance. In the near future
England will probably be well able to feed herself
without having to monkey with tariffs to oblige
countries that desire to unload their surplus food-
stuffs on her. When that time comes the task of
inducing the Cold Land to subsidise the export of
able-bodied agricultural workers will be difficult.
Whitechapel vignerons, Brummagem dairymen and
Manchester ploughmen will doubtless, however, be
still available in any number.

A. J. Kent, the new N. S. Wales Govern-
ment Printer, started in the department a
generation ago as reader’s boy.
“Jackeroo” : Very few compositors finish up
as graziers, but the late T. J. Elliot, who
owned several stations in W. Queensland,
started as a printer’s devil on a Mudgee
(N.S.W.) paper. He had sense enough to
leave the case early.
Of the knighthoods scattered about the
other day one fell upon Flinders Petrie,
Professor of Egyptology at University Col-
lege, London. He is a grandson of the Aus-
tralian navigator Capt. Matthew Flinders,
who is presently to have a statue near the
Mitchell Library, Sydney.
“Schnorrer”: Recently I spoke a piece
about members of the Chosen Race named
O’Brien, Macpherson and Smith. Add to
the list Abbott—as extraordinary a name for
a Jew as would be, say, Nunn. Yet Abra-
ham Henry Abramoviteh Abbott was buried
by the Sydney Chevra Ivadisha (Jewish
Burial Society) only the other day. *
Two of Adelaide’s best-known retailers,
Wendt (jeweller) and Baiioui-Bnckneli
(caterers), have just bought the freehold of
their Rundle-street shops. The price was
about £l2OO a foot. The money goes to Eng-
land, to a Thorngate estate, the now forgot-
ten founder ot which took up his original
Town Acre in 1838, along the now fashion-
able Rundle-street. At that time and for
long after the locality was looked on as out
of the way and so out of the running.
"Percy P.”: The loss of the Sumatra with
all hands will mean new adherents for one
stubborn naval superstition. While the ves-
sel was making down Sydney Harbor on
her last voyage somebody noticed that the
blue ensign was flying upside-down. The
defection, due to the carelessness of a Papuan
hand, was quickly rectified ; but any sailor-
man who noticed it is prepared to tell all
and sundry that calamity was inevitable.
“The Rumpus”: Happy Jack Scaddan,
Westralian Railway Minister, who is put-
ting. up something of a local record for long
Ministerial life, was at first shy of politics.
At the Workers’ Hall, in Boulder, he was
nominated for the Brownhill-Ivanhoe selec-
tion ballot, the winning of which practically
meant the seat; but before a seconder could
find his voice Scaddan was protesting,
“What do I know about Parliament? No,
no —pass me.” But the nomination was
seconded and carried with clamorous
approval, and John stepped into his career.
“Bildad” • The Commonwealth Bank
prospered greatly by handling the Govern-
ment’s ready-made loan and other business,
and where there was so much high finance
it could hardly do otherwise. But in a com-
petitive _ line it wasn’t quite so successful.
Tasmania handed over its State Savings
Bank to the Commonwealth, bargaining for
7 per cent, of the profits, and agreeing, as
a mere inatter of form, to share the loss, if
any. It is sharing the loss, for the two old-
established trustee savings banks pay better
interest than the big concern and get most
of the business.
“Arbeep”: Another well-plucked. Austra-
lia*l youngster turned up at Queanbeyan
(N.S.W.) the other day in nine-year-old
Cecil Charlton. When fox-shooting with
his father and brother, he managed to get
himself bushed. After an anxious search
the. father sent to town for help. Mean-
while the lad gave up hope of finding his
father, and struck out for the open country,
got his bearings, and started for home. It
was 16 miles from Queanbeyan, but the kid
walked it, and was home before the search-
parties set out to look for him. Although
dead-beat on arrival he was at school next
day.
"The Deacon” : Conan Doyle has some near
relations in Australia, but whether he looked
them up when he was here in pursuit of his
stray spooks was not recorded. Conan had
a brother who was an Anglican parson in
England, but threw up the church and came
to Australia to earn his living as an etcher
and a journalist. He had a batch of clever
daughters, but only one of them stayed in
this country after the old man called it a
day. She became (and still is) a Sister
of Mercy—l don’t know if her father ’verted
—and as Sister Ignatius, of the Monte Sant
Angelo, is devoting her life to doing good.
Mrs. Charlie Hedley, wife of the man who
knows nearly all about our fishes and reptiles,
is another near relative of the creator of
Sherlock Holmes.
“Flicker” gives a good man a send-off:—
To “the Deacon’s” tribute to the late Brother
Edwin, of St, Joseph’s College, Sydney, I’d like to
add my own. No St. Joe's man who was ever under
the charge of “Joe Bags” will ever forget him.
Cultured, scholarly and simple-natured as a child, he
was a potent influence for good on the lives of those
who were children of the Grey Mother up on the
Hill. Of English stock, ho was strenuously opposed
to the more extreme Irish policy, and held hot dis-
cussions with one particular “Wild Irishman,” who
was, by the way, a good Australian. Stately and
dignified, “Bags” was always ready to uphold his
standpoint against his more vehement Celtic-witted
adversary. But the controversy never embittered
him; every 12th of July his opponent would receive
an Orange lily “With Bro. Edwin’s compliments on
this auspicious day of memory.” Many an old boy,
as he climbs the long trail of steps towards the oid
school, will find a lump in the throat at the thought
that (lie familiar figure of “Old Bags” will no longer
be there to welcome him.
“Efght-and-Four”: S.A. Supreme Court is
considering a delicate question of technical
bigamy. An R.C. married his first cousin
just before going to the war. They never
lived as man and wife, and on his return
they agreed to consider the ceremony of no
effect. Their priest told them that .it was
null in the eyes of the Church, though valid
by the law of the land ; but both of them now
say that they understood from him it was
invalid every way, and they made no further
inquiries. The young man has since married
a Protestant, and is living happily with her.
Both wives gave evidence that tlie.v bore no
malice; but the second had not been told
about the first ceremony. A puzzled jury
called it at first “Guilty, but with no felo-
nious intent.” Judge Poole sent them back,
impressing it on them that without felonious
intent there can be no guilt, but that igno-
rance of the law does not excuse. So they
called it “Guilty, with a very strong recom-
mendation to mercy.” Then all proceedings
were hung up till the Full Court can decide
whether the Judge directed the jury rightly.

An Aid to Punctuality
The successful man who
starts his day’s work at a given
time and makes every minute
of the day count is quite apt to
depend upon a Westclox for
assistance.
He probably has one, per-
haps more, in his home, and
one where he works. He has
learned to depend upon a
Westclox to start him on time
in the morning and keep him
on time throughout the day.
Big Ben and the other mem-
bers of the Westclox family
have helped many a man carve
out a career. Westclox set
excellent examples for depend-
ability and punctuality. To-day
they are aiding several million
men, and women too, to get up
in the world.

Love.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WHO am jester gay with motley here—
This little space between the dusk
and day,
This fleeting masque of fantasy and fear
Before the dawning grey—•
May never, if I would, the motley doff!
I’oor prince of shadows, come of faery kin ;
A painted lath I wear in sign thereof,
The sword of Harlequin !
Ah, cap and bells, a court fool’s livery !
Under what star of malice was I born?
The merry dancers pass me mockingly
With laughter’s careless scorn.
Yet I pause, not, nor heed their loveliest,
Sole-shining, like all Beauty’s avatar.
How should I linger, whom a burning quest
Forever calls afar?
Not here, in these broad, gleaming halls,
that flame
Like silk-white splendor of a furnace
heart—
A ceaseless flux, yet evermore the same,
In which I crave no part;
Not here, nor in the whisp’ring corridors
Where Wisdom walks in smug futility,
Vexing the heart of truth with some vain
love’s
Unmeaning mystery ;
Nor on dim terraces where tendrilled vine
Makes a green quiet at the core of night
Do I behold those lips I have seen shine
Like gem-fires ruby-bright,
Glimpsed and then gone. And so I pass
athwart
Floors glimmering with the taper’s golden
rain,
To find, perchance, in niche or shadowed
court
Those Eros-flames again.
I know not if her face be very fair,
She whom I seek, who have but seen
her lips
Smile from the turn of some lost winding
stair
That up through shadow slips.
Red lips that burn below a silken mask
With dumb desire they may not all
repress;
Half-smiling lips that some strange ques-
tion ask
With haunting wistfulness.
I, the poor fool in motley, catch their gleam
Oft unawares, and my heart stops, as erst
When from the moonlit window of a dream
Did I behold them first.
The secret of her changeful witchery
I know not (love is baffling to define).
Nor crave to know who reck but this, that she
In some strange wise is mine.
Mine! And my questing heart grows glad
and strong.
Ah, cap and bells ; ah, sword of Harlequin !
How should these shame me now? A son
of song
And come of faery kin!
Mine! And the masque flames with the
elfin light .
That shone dream-sweet on morning hills
of time,
When Childhood’s summer wove in gold and
white
Lost songs of blossom rhyme.
The wistful fiddles call caressingly ;
In slow 7 , delicious minor sob the flutes.
Yet at my heart the surge of passion’s sea
Their ghost-thin music mutes.
Like a lost wand’rer finding (or he dreams)
A town of shadows mutable as mist,
Under strange skies shot through with sud-
den gleams
Of fire and amethyst,
So strangely and so blindly am I come
Here, where grey shadows dream of
ancientry
And rotting vellum drops to dust, ’mid dumb
And formless mystery;
Where rustling arras droops in purple gloom
And, brazen-sconced, the resined torches
flare
Where fear is lord, immutable as doom,
Guarding this turret stair.
This way she came! Ah, surely here, above
The sullen stairway, blind with murky
di’ead.
Beyond all thought of sorrow, lingers love
With luring lips of red?
Up, up through darkness —ah, that flitting
fear
Lest some veiled malice mocks!—the wind-
ings cease ;
Naught but the frozen flame of moonlight
here —
Night’s mystery and peace!
I will go downward through the gloom again.
A mist of music trembles in the air,
Down where the weary dancers mask their
pain.
Courage! She will be there.
A world of passion’s wealth to whisper o’er,
And I must haste; those lips have to my
heart
Ere. wdth the revels done, we too must part,
Haply to meet no more.
It may be that the dawn shall bring us
dreams
Fairer than seraph songs of singing flame,
When life lies drowned in those lethean
streams
From whence of old it came.
None know! Ah, love, we can but sigh
“Perchance!”
Death may bring other loves to claim your
kiss!
Give me this hour, while yet the dancers
dance,
While yet life dreams of bliss!
The hour grows late; the tapers gutter low.
Stay not for dalliance now, ah. lady dear!
The masque is dim ; those lips alone I know.
Unveil, the dawn is near!
QUEENSLAND.
J. HOLLOWAY.
The Colac Cup.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GIVE a dog a bad name and it will
stick; and it is the same with a
jockey.
Joe Scott, the finest little rider in the
western district of Victoria, had got his bad
name and could not shake it off, the last
episode making it blacker than ever for him ;
yet not a straighter jockey rode. Fortune
had been against him during the last six
months: when he rode a favorite he could
not win, but his luck in bringing the out-
sider home, first was uncanny. It made
punters and stewards alike talk.
The black day I’ve mentioned came when
he rode Jezebel in the Trial for me at Golac
at the remunerative odds of 15 to 1. I had
called my horse Jezebel because She was about
the wickedest brute I ever saw, a sour ani-
mal with a mouth as hard as iron. She won
in a canter, but was disqualified for first
place for boring, having swung right across
the course in turning into the straight, carry-
ing the favorite with her, and that after
crossing the field too quickly before coming
to the turn for home. For this Joe went out
for two months, and with a sigh of relief for
themselves, and none for the little horseman
nor for me as owner, punters collected their
even-money bets on the favorite, and stew-
ards settled down for a brief period of less
worry.
I felt aggrieved, and, determined to equal-
ise matters, entered the unknown Caesar for
the Colac Cup (1J mile) two months later;
also, I arranged for my bosom pal Charlie
Baxter to enter his best and well-known
metropolitan performer Highlander, who was
a class above Colac Cup performers. All of
which goes to show that I meant to “put up
a stall” for that race. And this is what
happened.
Of course Highlander was the favorite and
a hot one —6 to 4 on. Caesar’s odds were 10
to 1 against, and better for small sums.
Knowing Caesar could beat everything in the
race excepting Highlander, I distributed £5O
on “the Roman Emperor” (Caesar’s nick-
name) at prices showing a return of £565.
The scheme was simple, for Baxter had
promised me his horse would not win, even
though he had a hundred on it at 6 to 4
that was in order that the stewards might
feel friendly towards him “should High-
lander be left at the barrier, or run sour, as
he sometimes does,” said Charlie with a wink,
adding: “Don’t worry about my hundred,
old man. You would do the same for me.
And I won’t lose it; if Ido it will come back
again.” Which sounded ambiguous enough.
He had brought Bobby Carter along to
ride for him. Carter being at the head of
the winning list of jockeys, his mounts were
always in the boom, so the price had been
made for Caesar, who, of course, was reserved
for little Joe —his first ride since disqualifica-
tion.
At barrier-rise I expected Highlander,
who had top weight (9st. 31b.), to get a bad
start. Carter was doing all he could to
bring it about; his horse would not stand
quiet for a moment, rearing and letting fly
with his hind legs continuously, until the
crowd was sick of his evolutions. As the
start was nearly opposite the grandstand
Carter’s endeavors to soothe the savage
favorite were keenly watched, and a cheer
went up as the starter, to my mind, beat
the jockey. Anticipating a bound forward
on the part of the horse he raised the barrier
and Highlander got a flying start. _ Carter
had been outwitted! Checking his horse,
however, he had managed to get back to
second position on the rails as they ran past
the grandstand. Csesar (6st. 131 b.) was
nicely placed on his flank, but there was no
pace on. So they ran to the back of the
course, where, according to instructions, Joe
was to jump the field and get a winning lead.
It was beautiful the way he got the break,
simply because none of the other jockeys ex-
pected anything to try to clear out at that
stage. He simply streaked away ; leaning well
down on his mount, he rode as if the race
was only four furlongs.
“There’s only one in it,” was the cry, as
Caesar, full of running, got to the straight
with a six lengths’ clear lead. Barrackers
were roaring his name —“Caesar! Caesar!”
everywhere.
It was lovely thinking of that five-sixty-
five as “home and dried,” though, to be quite
candid, there was not exactly the same thrill
about it as if Caisar was genuinely beating
the great Highlander.
As the field approached the straight Bobby
Carter got to work for appearance sake to
ride for a win, and he did it well. With whip
out he, too, had secured a break on the field
and was after the leader. The horsemanship
was superb. Caesar was travelling so well
that Joe Scott had no occasion to use the
whip, but his hands were working to capa-
city. He was not going to be caught napping
by easing up too soon. Highlander, all the
same, was gaining. He was surely and
steadily decreasing the gap.
Carter knew how to ride a finish. There
was judgment in the start he had given, for
no matter how hard he rode Caesar seemed
safe. Down the straight they came stretched
out to the full, and as Highlander gradually
drew closer his name began to be proclaimed
in a growing volume. It was a glorious
burst of speed, even though it was nevpv
meant to carry the top weight first past the
post. I admired Carter’s jockeyship. No one
could say he was not a trier.
Halfway down the straight Caesar was
only two iengths ahead, so overwhelming had
been Highlander’s spurt. Joe Scott was
now at it with whip without _ mercy. Caesar
was game and maintained his lead for an-
other hundred yards. The pace was a killer.
Surely Carter must ease a trifle now—he had
made his effort for the benefit of the public.
But no, he was still riding it out and still
gaining.
“Damn it!” I muttered to myself, “he’ll
win if he doesn’t take a pull.” And the crowd
roared “Highlander wins! Caesar wins.
as the two galloped on as only thorough-
breds can.

Accidents will happen, and the germs of skin-
disease are always round about us. To be fore-armed
with Zam-Buk is a wise precaution.
Whether it be a simple injury, a worrying outbreak
of rash or pimples, or a painful attack of eczema or ulcers,
Zam-Buk is equally indispensable. Of herbal origin,
Zam-Buk has antiseptic, healing and soothing properties
all associated in the purest and most effective manner
possible.
Zam-Buk makes and keeps a wound or sore clean and
healthy, whilst its unique healing properties ensure the
growth of new skin. The skin that is once made healthy
by Zam-Buk has the best chance of keeping free from
future troubles.
Another advantage of Zam-Buk ig that it keeps its
medicinal power indefinitely. No matter how long you
keep a box of Zam-Buk, it will never turn rancid and
useless like common ointments and salves, made up of
animal fats and mineral drugs.
You cannot afford to be without Zam-Buk, the healer
which safeguards your everyday injuries against festering
and blood-poison. Zam-Buk is also invaluable for

A hundred yards left, and Highlander’s
nose was up to Csesar’s wither. What did
Carter mean! If ever jockey was riding
to win he was. He was hogging his animal
in his determination to get in front, and
Scott was doing likewise to keep there.
Neither horse- flinched. Whips and hands
and the roar from the grandstand all urged
the excited animals on to the winning post.
Highlander had bridged the gap as they
flushed past the grandstand. It was stride
for stride, with no advantage to either, as
the winning post was passed, the two appa-
rently locked together, and the crowd in one
roar of excitement proclaiming “Caesar
wins!” “Highlander wins!” “A dead heat!”
all in one breath. It seemed ages, though it
was only a case of seconds till the numbers
rose: No. 1 (Highlander) first, No. 15.
(Caesar) second!
Then I saw red and damned everybody in
the universe. It was a humiliating moment.
I was staggered and crushed. My rottenness
had been scorned by Baxter, which made me
feel more rotten than ever. He had run
straight while knowing that I was prepared
to sink to dirty, underhand tactics. It hurt.
My pride was humbled. But it rose again
as Carter, returning to scale, grinned at me
from ear to ear. I felt like kicking him
into eternity. He was safer on his horse in
the weighing enclosure than adjacent to' me
at that moment. What I had taken for bluff-
ing at the start of the race had been genuine
horsemanship. I was the simple Muggins.
The stewards and the punters once more
had the advantage; and already the latter
were thronging to the betting-ring to
collect.
In the midst of my ferment Baxter
appeared. ‘‘Think you’re damned clever, I
suppose,” I whispered.
“Need to be at this game, George,” he
answered.
“That’s right. Be funny too. Ido like a
chap who lets his pal down with lies,”
was my retort.
“Steady, George; you’re talking rot. You
must admit it was a great race and the
better horse won. Csesar’s a good ’un,
though.”
“Thanks, but we’re through. Go and col-
lect your bets.”
“Right,” he answered. “I’ll collect as soon
as Highlander’s jock has weighed in.”
Even as he was speaking the bubble burst.
Carter had failed to draw the weight. He
was 31b. light; a lead had been dropped out
of his jacket during the progress of the
rfice, and Caesar was placed first.*
“You see, George,” said Baxter afterwards,
when the excitement had subsided, “the pub-
lic and stewards are sympathising with me
on my hard luck. They think Carter a won-
derful jockey for that finish he put in ; that
compensates somewhat for their loss. The
‘books’ know I had a hundred on High-
lander and have lost the Cup money too;
but fifty pounds on Caesar at starting price,
10 to 1, equals five hundred, and Carter
knows that he loses nothing for his ‘acci-
dent.’ Yes, a friend of mine worked that
commission of fifty in the city for me. And
notv let’s go and drink to the winner.”
I had only enough breath to gasp:
“Charlie, you’re too damned clever for me.”
J. Selwyn Brown.
*The same thing happened to Alilat’s jockey
in the Camperdown Cup (1917).
Bahloo the Poisoner.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BAHLOO aspired to the biting of a
thumb. And Bahloo was particular.
Not any thumb would do. It must
be the thumb of Wien. No fewer than three
times had he manoeuvred in -vain ; and once
he had almost lost his head in the attempt.
For Wien was a great man—feared by the
tribe if not revered. Even the hurdaitcha,
the medicine-men who usually disposed of
such menaces to the village, even these
avoided Wien, and had thrice refused Bahloo
the privilege of biting his enemy’s thumb.
But Bahloo tried a fourth time—and suc-
ceeded. Bahloo was ever a fool.
It was in the early night that it began.
The wind, just audible in-the leafy tops of
the tall, white-trunked gums, droned an
accompaniment to the occasional crackle of
the equally drowsy fire. It was cold, very
cold, as the partial freezing of the water in
the gourds farthest from the fire showed.
The generous embers radiated a lazy com-
fort over those of the tribe who chose to
squat on their hams around them. A resin-
ous-clayish reek arose from the red-ochred
heads and greased bodies, and hung thickly
in the zone of warmth.
A game was indulged in, the play of the
coolabah leaf. One of these leaves was taken
by each player, who proceeded to curl it
by exposure to the heat of the fire. The
Owner of the leaf which, soared highest won.
And always did Dheala’s leaf Soar highest.
Wien sat opposite Dheala, and Bahloo on
her left. Rightly were they seated, for
Bahloo was Dheala’s door-oothai —her lover.
Wien was not —at least, not yet.
And rightly, too, were Bahloo and Wien
named. Bahloo’s face was like unto the
moon, and so he was called. His high
cheekbones melted into the forehead above
and the chin below; his broad, flattened
nose had little if any bridge; and he was
beardless. His chest was shallow, his arms
thin and his legs absurd spindles; his skin
was of a coppery hue, and his hair was
lank. A poor thing Bahloo, and a fool.
Quite different was Wien. Like a dingo he
was, and so named. Hairy and deep of
chest, he had the biceps of a gorilla. His
legs, less spindleshaped than Bahloo’s, ex-
panded into a narrow buttock with an ele-
gant muscular hollow behind the hip. _ His
curly hair and matted beard were typical;
physically a splendid example of his race.
A violently lustful polygamist, too, he. rarely
awaited his wife’s death before choosing an-
other. His love-making was as brief as his
temper was terrible.
Wien had been a widower for three days;
and Dheala was good to look upon. Her
body was firm and supple; and, moreover,
she was sensible. Did not her coolabah leaf
mount the highest? And was she not more
apt, yea, even than Bahloo, at ghiribul or
riddles? Also was she fleet of foot; fleeter
of foot even than Wien. It mattered little
to Wien that she was promised to Bahloo, or
that Bahloo had paid his due to her family
and relations. Who was this fool that he
should stand in the way?
For the seventh time Dheala’s leaf had dis-
appeared from sight, and the exclamations
of wonder and admiration were just dying
down. Then it happened. With a bound
Wien had leapt across the fire, seized the
girl’s wrist, and was dragging her off. Bahloo
had half-risen in defence, but recoiled at
the venomous glare from Wien’s bloodshot
eyes. He was helpless and afraid—and he
knew it
' Grunts first of disapproval and then of
resignation and indifference came from the
rest of the men. This was Bahloo’s affair,
and they proceeded with the game.
11 i
Bahloo knew something w a sex pec ted of
him. He crawled away into the darkness,
almost mad with the sound of his woman s
now faintly-distant wailings and his own i n-
and wandered out into the night
Twelve moons went before Dheala s rela ■
tions again saw Bahloo; and when he re-
turned his body burned at the tale of how
Dheala had died two moons after Wien had
taken her. Now more, far more, he desired that
Wien, the dingo, should die; for that Dheala
his beloved had died by gilddeegooree, , the
poison-stick, at the instigation ot \\ ien,
seemed to Bahloo beyond all question, bo
the hate in him conquered the fear, and once
more he disappeared. But this time he re-
appeared in a month ; and thereafter he went
nowhere without a small bladder suspended
from his girdle. .
Only one man, Mounin the Mosquito, had
ever claimed from Wien atonement for in-
jury. At the time it was agreed by the
council that, as was the custom, Wien should
receive either one blow T from the club of
Mounin or have his thumb bitten. Mounin,
with none of Bahloo’s fear but all of his
frailty,jLmd chosen club. Wien had been
stunned', and the blow had left a scar which
he still carried. Three days later Mounin
had been found cleanly decapitated by a
boomerang.
And now Bahloo wanted to bite Wien’s
thumb. He claimed the right in council,
Wien craftily offered to take a blow 7 from
Bahloo’s club. But Bahloo would have none
of it. He w 7 ould bite the thumb of. Wien,
And everyone thought it w r as because of the
fate of Mounin, who had chosen the club,
Whereat the men laughed. But Bahloo was
patient. Cowards are ever so.
When he saw 7 Wien, for the moment a
wudower, casting his lustful eye towards Wi,
he wooed and took to wife the girl’s sister,
one Cunnumbeellee, an ugly creature called
after the pigweed root. And ever did he
carry the little pouch at his girdle.
This was Bahloo’s fourth attempt to bite
the thumb of Wien; for did he not know
that the fate of Wi was sealed, and that she
would not outlive three or four months’;
And rightly did Bahloo reason. Two months
found Wi’s dead body with a crushed skull
on the dry waste across the creek. Then it
was that Bahloo arose and demanded jus-
tice, appealing to his brothers in the name
of his wife Cunnumbeellee, the sister of Wi.
Did he desire the death of Wien? No!
B.vamee, the god of all things, who dwelt
beyond the farthest hills, would see that
Wien would die and become prey to Euloo-
wayi, the long-nailed devils, as soon as he,
Bahloo, had had revenge. And the old men
of the council solemly agreed that so it must
be. But that Bahloo of all people should
strike the first blow at Wien, whom all
feared, was a thing to be wondered at.
Noon the following day came with the
gathering of the tribe to witness the biting
of the thumb of Wien. Glaring with blood-
shot eyes at the circle, he stood defiantly in
the centre. Bah! Bahloo hadn’t the. strength
of jaw to as much as break the skin of his
thumb!
Now Bahloo stepped forward with tremb-
ling hands and compressed lips. His meagre
frame looked contemptible beside that of
Wien; his left hand rested shakily on his
girdle; his right nervously fingered the small
pouch hanging from it.
At length an old man asked. Bahloo for-
mally if indeed he intended to bite the thumb
of Wien. But Bahloo answered nothing;
which was strange, seeing that Bahlob ever
Said much when he was able..
Then the old man gave the sign for Wien
to extend his thumb. He obeyed, with a
snarl at Bahloo, who tremblingly approached.
A crunch of bone and a smashing of teeth
broke the silence when Bahloo bit as he had
never bitten before.
Not a sound did either man utter. In-
stead of the annihilation of the shivering
Bahloo by Wien, the latter stood as one
dazed —the mangled thumb hanging limply,
Bahloo continued to shiver, and to spit
blood and teeth, surprise and horror on his
face. But no one paid any attention to Bah-
loo. All notice was riveted on Wien. He
stared seemingly at nothing. Presently a
convulsion brought him to the ground, where,
emitting a roar, he gave one final spasm and
lay quite still.
The Dingo was dead.
The hitherto awed audience completely
failed in the understanding of this strange
death. “Eleanbah ! Eleanbah !” they shouted.
It was wizardry. It could be no one else’s
wizardry than that of Bahloo. Where was
Bahloo? The wrath of 60 men and as many
women and children descended upon the
magic-maker.
They found him a few yards away with a
convulsed face and horribly-contorted limbs.
The little bag of snake-poison was still
attached to his belt. He had not counted on
the breaking of his own teeth, and the con-
sequent entrance of the venom to his own
body.
