THE RED PAGE
The Dweller on the Th reshold —Robert
Ilichens (Dymoek’s). It has been said
that Hichens alternates his good stories
with pot-boilers. This is not one of the
good stories. The author’s main con-
cern has been the occult theme, and his
characters are shadowy.
Jane Oglandei Mrs. Belloc Lowndes
(Ileinemann, and Bymock’s). Here the
personages of the story have the semb-
lance of reality. Jane is a charming
woman, and the men act like men. This
clever book is as good as any that Mrs.
Lowndes has written.
John Verney —H. A. Vac hell (Murray). A
love story, in which the characters of
that capital school story, The Hill, ap-
pear again.
The Bine Bird —Maeterlinck (Angus and
Robertson). Paper-covered edition at
Is. 3d., containing a new act written at
the suggestion of Herbert Trench to re-
place the Forest scene.

The Pre-Raphaelites Again
I Ford Madox Bi-own, in whose studio D.
G. Rossetti wox'ked for some tirnfe, gave di-
rection to the Pre-Raphaelite movement,
though he never belonged to it. The cult
soon faded away (except in Holman Hunt,
who was faithful to the last), but its influ-
ence remained; and most of the men who
were associated with it, or with the magnetic
centre of it—Rossetti—have achieved dis-
tinction in the arts. Madox Brown was in
close touch with the group, which included
the Rossettis, Swinburne, Morris, Burne-
Jones find others of similar aims and en-
thusiasms. In his house, which Thackeray
described as Colonel Newcome’s, his grand-
son, Ford Madox Hu offer, spent most of his
royhood. Hueffer has since added to the
leavily “documented” history of the rnove-
nent a biography of his grandfather, and a
itudy of Rossetti. He has also wi'itten
levels and poems, and, though still a young
nan, he now publishes a volume of remin-
scences, Ancient Lights and Certain New
Inflections (Sydney Book Club).
Hueffer’s father was a genius, his mother
vas the daughter of a genius, he was related
o the Rossettis, and the unfortunate lad
?as tiained as one destined to be a genius
00. >
In those days, as a token of my Pre-
taphaelite origin, I wore very long golden
air, a suit'of ’ greenish-yellow coi’duroy vel-
eteen with gold buttons, and two stockings,
1 winch one was red and the other green,
.hese garments were the curse of my joung
xistenee, and the joy of every street boy
mo saw me.
such treatment and the example set
>efore him of his cousins, the Ros-
ettis, “horrible monsters of precocity,”
xade him loathe the word “genius,”
nd .he says that the happiest times
f his childhood were passed in a cellar
eading about the exploits of Ilarkaway
>ick. He certainly was not prejudiced in
Ivor of the Pre-Raphaelite idea, or the per-
jrmances of D. G. Rossetti, whom he classed
s an amateur who had failed in two arts.
My father once wrote of Rossetti, that he
put down the thoughts of Dante in the
language of Shakespeare, and the words
seem to me to be exti-einely true and ex-
tremely damning. For what is wanted of a
poet is that he should express his own
thoughts in the language of his own time.
There he “says sooth” so far as the general
principle is concerned; but he forgets that
the best of Rossetti’s poetry is his own
thought in the finest language of h-is own
time.
Hueffer regards Christina Rossetti as
much greater than her brother; in fact, “the
greatest master of words—at least of Eng-
lish words—that the nineteenth centui-y
igave us.” Ruskin, he says, pooh-poohed and
discouraged her work ; yet in the matter of
precision it was widely separated from the
loose romanticism of Ruskin and those whom
he boomed.
Love, according to the Pre-Raphaelite
canon, was a great but rather sloppy pas-
sion. Its manifestations would be Paolo
and Francesca, or Launcelot and Guinevere.
It was a thing that you swooned about on
broad general lines, your eyes closed, vour
arins outstretched. . . . No doubt what D.
G. Rossetti and his school thought was that
although guilty lovers Lave to go to Hell
for the sake of the story, they will find Hell
pleasant enough because the aroma of their
passion, the wings of the great god of love
and the swooning intensity of it all will
I'endef* them insensible to the inconvenience
of their lodgings. As much as to sav that
you do not mind the bad cooking of the
Brighton Hotel if you are having otherwise
a good time of it.
He pictures these people with their golden
visions of Launcelot and Guinevere and their
songs of music and moonlight, as living in a
region of soot-blackened brick houses, and an
atmosphere of brownish g100m.... They
swore loudly and frequently, quarrelled vig-
orously and made it up. spent their money
freely, and ate heartily. It is related that
Morris threw a pudding at the servant be-
cause it wasn’t big enough, and on another
occasion shouted to her: —
“Mary, those six eggs were bad. I’ve
eaten them, but don't let it occur again.”
The lives of some of them were ill-regulated,
but they were generous; they helped to sell
each other’s pictures, and log-rolled for their
own poets, ' When any drunken geniuses were
found in Madox Brown’s neighborhood they
were taken to his house as a sure refuge.
When Shields, walking down Piccadilly, was
told by Harold Bathbone that he had in-
duced a corporation to buy Holman Hunt’s
“Triumph of the Innocents,” he stopped in
the crowded street and said :
“You have, Harold! Let me kiss you,
Harold.”
Whereupon these eminent artists embraced.
The great difference between those days and
the present, according to Hueffer, is that then
a poet was regarded as a seer and priest, by
virtue of his craft, while now a poet is no-
thing unless he is a politician, or has a pur-
pose. And to-day the magic words for all
writers are “price per thou.” The deadly
commercial spirit came in with the new cen-
tury, and “that never to be sufficiently ac-
cursed Boer War set as it were an iron door
between the past and the present.”
Hueffer wails tiresomely over the decay of
art and letters, though he says that there are
still men like W. 11. Hudson —“the finest, the
most delicate, and the most natural of sty-
lists that we have or have ever had.” Yet
he has some good stories to tell. His view
of the Ancient Lights is interesting, and it
was in obedience to the ironies that the last
kick at a dead cult should come from one
trained within the circle.
The Recently Departed
I Italy has possessed for many years past
one who appeared in poetry, drama and
fiction as a brilliant advocate for the Flesh
and the Devil. The work of D’Annunzio
quickly found its way into French and Eng-
lish, and the lyrical fervor of his prose was
not entirely lost in translation. At the
same time there was in Italy a novelist who
had taken a brief for the Other Side.
Antomo Fogazzaro published his first book
in 1874, and Malombra , a novel, appeared
m English in 1896. It was not, however,
intil The Saint was “indexed” by the Vati-
can a few years ago, that foreign interest
vas awakened in this man’s work. The
lovel is the most effective pulpit in the
vorld, and with such an advertisement as
he Papal ban, Fogazzaro has attracted a
nuch larger congregation than the artistic
nerit of bis stories could command.
Leila, which ,is a continuation of The
•saint, was published ; in London in March
ast, on the same day that re-
vived of Fogazzaro’s death in Italy. It
s, like its predecessor, a heavy novel. * Many
>ages of discussion on religious or philo-
iophical questions have to be, passed before
>ne gets to the action. Leila becomes an
teiress while under legal age, and priests
md lawyers plot to rob her. When
he escapes to meet her lover, a dis-
iple of The Saint, there are some emotion-
.l passages, in which Fogazzaro almost
quals D Annunzio. The story closes in an
tmosphere of sanctity, which will commend
:to lovers of shandy-gaff fiction. Fogaz-
aro was probably a much better man than
D x\.nnunzio; but he was an inferior artist.

Bir Alfred Lyall, who died last month, at
the age of 76, is remembered for some of
his ‘Verses Written in India.” British
pride was flattered by his fine tribute to that
Invate of the Buffs who died rather than
kow-tow to a Chinaman. This and another
eulogy of Thomas Atkins have been favored
by wide circulation in schoolbooks. Some
stanzas from the “Meditations of a Hindu
I nnce exhibit Lyall’s talent at its best:
Here, in this mystical India, the deities
hover and swarm
Like the wild bees heard in the tree-tops, or
trio gusts of ix gathering storm;
In the air men hear their voices, their feet
on the rocks are seen,
Yet we all say, “Whence is the message, and
I what may the wonders mean V”
A million shrines stand open, and ever the
censer swings,
As they bow to a mystic symbol, or the
figures of ancient kings;
And the incense rises ever, and rises the end-
less cry
Of those who are heavy laden, and of cow-
ards loth to die.
For the Destiny drives us together, like deer
in a pass of tlie hills
Above is the sky and around us the sound
of the shot that kills ;
lush’d by a power we see not, and struck
by a hand unknown,
We pray to the trees for shelter, and press
our lips to a stone.
The trees wave a shadowy answer, and the
rock frowns hollow and grim,
And the form and the nod of the demon are
caught in the twilight dim •
And we look at the sunlight falling afar on
the mountain crest —
Is there never a path runs upward to a
refuge there and a rest?
Lyall also published Asiatic Studies, a Life
of W arren Hastings, and a monograph on
Tennyson.

The N.S.W. Bookstall Co. sends That
Droll Lady, being the further adventures of
Bridget McSweeney, as told by Tlios.
E. Spencer. Lionel Lindsay’s portrait on
the cover gives the lady to the life—with her
generous figure, her expansive smile and her
Chanteeler hat. As in the previous books,
the stories of her latest doings are told with
zest, and one imagines that the author en-
joyed them himself. They make that sort
of broad homely comedy which benefits the
digestion of the multitude, and the Member
was not far wrong when he told Mrs. Mac.
at the bazaar, in the new book: —
“While the people have your advintures
to read, the counthry will be safe. The
people will be good timpered and continted,
and take no notice of the Govermint. Every-
body will be happy, for divil a soul could
read them and be miserable.”
The laugh-maker died on the 6th instant,
just before the appearance of this book.
Tlios. E. Spencer was born in London on
the 30th December, 1845. When 18 he
came to Australia, and tried gold milling—
without much luck. He returned to London
and worked as a stonemason, and at the age
of 30 came back to Australia. Since then
he spent most of his time in settling disputes
between Fat and Labor, with great satis-
faction to everybody, and in spare hours he
reeled off a large amount of prose and verse
<>f a wildly humorous order. Spencer was
a good sort and a bright writer.
Books for Home Study
The Home University Library, just
launched by Williams and Norgate, under
the editorship of Herbert Fisher, Prof. Gil-
bert Murray and Prof. J. Arthur Thomson,
is likely to be useful. - It will comprise up-
to-date monographs on general questions, and
will be sold at Is. net per volume.
Right volumes have been issued: Parlia-
ment, its History, Constitution and Practice,
by Sir Courtenay Ilbert, The Evolution of
Plants by I). H. Scott, Polar Exploration by
W. S. Bruce, who has had experience in seven
voyages to the Arctic and Antarctic. The
French Revolution is safe in the hands of
Hilaire Belloc, and Marion Newbigin begins
Modern Geography promisingly, by compar-
ing it to one of Rodin’s statues “in which we
see a beautiful figure struggling to escape
from the marble in which it is imprisoned”
the marble being the dull collections of
fact which used to be taught as geography.
A Short History of War and Peace, by G. H.
Perris, is a valuable survey of the" move-
ments of humanity which have made, nations
and broken them up, leaving the reader at
the end of the Russo-Jap affair impressed
by the enormous cost of war, and with the
faint hope that war will become impossible.
The most attractive book in the bunch is
on the stalest of subjects, to wit, William
Shakespeare. The immortal works were
tackled by John Masefield with real enjoy-
ment and understanding, and the result is a
fresh and vivid study which will greatly help
the young reader. Masefield pays a tribute
to the editors whose labors have helped to
make the text clear; but he passes by the
I debatable questions and fastens on the life
which the artist created and reflected.
“Art,” he says in the preface, “is the thought
of men with vision
Worldly empire has always been glutton-
ous or foolish. It has always been a mon-
strous sentimental bubble blown out of some-
thing dea,d that was once grand. Man’s
true empire is not in continents nor over
the sea, but within himself, in his own soul.
Here in London, where a worldly empire is
controlled, there exists no theatre in which
the millions can see that other empire. They
pass from one grey street to another grey
street, to add up figures or to swallow patent
medicines, with no thought that life has been
lived nobly, and burningly, and knightly for
great ends, and in great passions, as the
vision of our great mind declares.
The Poets and the Harem-Skirt
Now was I transported to the Paradise of
the Poets, where the spirits of the Living
consort with the apparitions of the Dead.
And while there it so befell that a wager
was set, for a laurel-wreath—the subject to
be the Harem-skirt, and the revolt of the
Wowser thereat. But ere the wreath was
awarded the sky burst into a billion of
stars and the dream vanished, for I had
fallen out of bed; and around me, 10, the
crayfish shells of supper. Yet was the mem-
ory of some of the verses warm within me.
so that I seized pen and recorded them; and
behold the record :
A TROUSER-FANTASY.
Rose-haunted blooms, the maidens stand
With cheeks like sunset seas,
And burn to thread the twilight land
In harem-draperies.,
I watch their blown-gold hair of love
In amber tresses long,
What time there sings a silver dove
A trouserine strange song.
My thought wings after his: yea, mine
Through fantasy is ranged:
I see pale hobbles opaline
To crimson knickers changed :
“Their pants shall be of rose-silk built.
Or dusked with tints of jade,
Perfumed with lilac-bloom, and gilt,
And trimmed with pearly braid,
“And rayed sardonyx bloomers wide
On which great jewels burn:
A ticket-pocket at the 1 side,
Watch-pockets in the 1 stern. ...”
Yet at this, vision dear of sin
My sere world faded pale ;
A Wowser incense floated in
Across the perfumed gale:
A scent that held no written words
But, sweet as sandal sieved,
Breathed Quit Male Garments'! —silver
chords
That hit them where they lived,
Until no more such faery frill
Upon their fair limbs shone,
passed—ah, passed as fashions will,
Where faded moons have gone.
V. D.
THE TROUSER-FLOWER.
All the whims of our high dames strew
Life with pains and with modes that hurt:
There comes the spell of a fashion new
And the Sex goes mad on the Harem-
skirt —
A Trouser, braided at edge with gold,
A Trouser, merging in single mass,
But a Trouser still, and with charms to hold
Her heart, who wears it by sun or gas.
Men meet its beauty with furrowed face,
And boys its strangeness with jeering
barb,
For all things male, it would seem, grimace
On catching sight of the Harem-garb:
At night they gaze on the Skirt, and lo!
It damps their fire as they crane their
necks:
They dream no more of Romance’s glow
Or cuddle, or kiss, or the “softer sex.”
Girl-loved, it brings with its threat occult
A hid revolt, as from velvet claws.
Though cults be weird, is there any cult
Like this mad cult of the Turkish draw’rs?
Pale Wowsers, weary of Janes reformed
That fall and fall and forever fall,
Soul-worn, turn wildly to sins unstormed.
Go mad at the Trouser, and check its
thrall.
The Fashion spelled by the Trouser swoons;
Its crudeness staggers e’en modiste’s
mood ;
And thus perchance in a few short moons
The Wowser weakens its spell for good—
Then Dress, as of old, shall re-grace the
“blocks,”
And a skirt be One, though it spreads or
clings,
And limbs hint through, with their stock-
inged clocks,
The Charm and Beauty of Hidden Things !
—R. Q.
THE PANTS OF AUSTRALASIA.
We boast no more of our horseless coach, or
our (Temperance) drunkless beer;
Rather we sink to a sad reproach, for the
Skirtless Girl is here.
Yea, Woman is playing the game low-down,
far worse than she did before—
I tell you this Craving for Rants will drown
in the blood-red tides of War!
We boast, mere males, of the lone delights
we have held for our sex, I know —
But what of a Man and those self-same
rights, when his Pants begin to go?
There is the point that we will not yield—
concession no husband grants,
And Man will light as on Football Field for
his sacred right to Pants,
bo long as he rages at Women’s thrall, and
jumps on his Sunday hat,
And the scorn of Wowsers, and curse of All,
hangs heavy on Things like That.
The time is ripe for the Hens of Fate to
hatch us an answer sage,
W hen the Wowsers rise in a trouser-liate, a-
capering, wild with rage,
kor the Juds will spring to a fierce death-
grapple, ere hundred moons of cark,
With Protest-meetings in ev’ry chapel, and
ev ry church its Nark
To jeer and sneer and remark “Ay-mca!”
and many a curate pert
Will tell us how women are really men, that
pass in a Harem-skirt;
And loafers waiting for One Who Shouts,
in the hours of their loafage sere
Will have something better to talk about
than the painful drought of Beer:
For this you will learn from the libelled
Past, though they teach it not in
school :
“A Fashion’s lost when the laughs fall fast,
and is shattered by Ridicule”!
Twill be while ever our chests hold lights
and tongues have a tale to pitch,
That Trousers arc Men's, not Women’s,
—or we’d never tell Which from
Which:
And chastened Wowser, and Tug unlicked,
alike, ere the Sex recants,
Must write, in the Book of the Men Who
Kicked, how they Held the Fort—for
Pants !

delightful and rapid relief; and to those who are subject
to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a
complete cure. It is most comforting in allaying Irrita-

and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption is

CLEMENTS TONIC CURED
Read this remarkable letter
and send for this medicine.
The following is a letter received from Mr. John L. England, 185 a Cuba
Street, Wellington, New Zealand, and though the subiect of it lives far away
it is none the less the true story of a great physical resurrection from the greatest
form of ill-health to one of splendid strength. All sick men or women should
read this testimony, and benefit by the reading :
Clements Tonic Ltd.
“I feel it my duty to mankind in general to let you publish this, what I consider
as a remarkable citye. Three years ago I was badly crushed in an accident on the
wharf in Wellington, and I never earned or was lit to earn a week’s wages for a
period of 16 months. After that time I commenced to earn a little, but my life was
a complete misery. Eat I could not, nor sleep, and I suffered awful pain ; I would
double up and could not straighten my back. At last I wasted away over 281 b. in
weight, and got that nervous that I could not follow my occupation. In the mean-
time no one would credit the amount of pills and medicine and tonic that I had taken,
some of which would give me a false stait, but after a few hours I would be as bad
again.
About six weeks ago I saw an advertisement in the Wellington Evening Post,
describing a case similar to mine. I procured a bottle of your Tonic, and, before I
had finished the first bottle, I felt a new man. I commenced to eat a hearty meal.
I commenced to sleep seven or eight hours at a stretch. I could feel the elastic step
and the straight shoulders coming back again, the eye that could not bear the light or
the sun, brightening again. My weight increased in four weeks from 9st. 61b. r;
lOst. 111 b., and after taking 10 bottles of your wonderful tonic, I feel a new man, and
shall never be without it; not forgetting Fletcher’s Pills, which you sell with the
tonic, and which I found very useful for my liver, from which I suffered great agony.
I give you full liberty to publish this testimonial to the whole world, as it is abso-
lutely true.
(Signed) JOHN L. ENGLAND.”
Men who suffer from Brain-fag, Loss of Nerve, Weakness, Loss of Sleep, Indigestion,
Low Spirits, Constipation, Weak Kidneys or Sluggish Liver, and who want to get
well and feel young again,- should get this medicine. It is as good for women,
especially for Anaemia or Broken Rest, Biliousness, Sick Headache, Melancholia, or
Constipation. ALL CHEMISTS and STORES sell it everywhere.

Hard coughs are bad enough, to
be sure. But it’s often the lit-
tle, hacking, tickling, persistent
cough that means the most,
especially when there is a his-
tory of weak lungs in the family.
What should be done? Ask your
doctor. He knows. Ask him
about the formula on the label
of every bottle of Ayer’s Cherty
Pectoral. Ask him if this med-

do as he says.

SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of
the Tobacco habit if they knew they
could do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it
up is to tempt death by Heart Disease,
Nervous Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and
Stomach, Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIg is a harmless,
vegetable remedy that will make the user
of tobacco in any form absolutely abandon
the habit for good. It not only destroys
the craving, the desire, the appetite for
tobacco, but restores to health the entire
nervous system, and aids nature in entirely
eliminating from the system the Nicotine

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To What Good?
When in the night I fold my hands and gently say
my prayer,
Thin tangled visions come to me of Mary’s golden
hair,
With taste of cups that I have drained to quench
a royal thirst,
And strains of music, wisps of song, and curses I
have cursed.
Another day, another year, the sounds and shadows
pass,
And each confirms the thought that I was somehow
born an ass.
My soul is high when in the morn I laoe my shining
boot,
The world is mine with stored delight and realms
of joy to loot;
The roses blossom on my way, I keep my shoulders
high,
And deep rejoicing fills my heart, proclaiming I
am I
A day of toil and idle talk, some beer, a worn-out
play,
And in the night the same old dreams of things
that pass away.
Some days ago, in earliest spring, I paused at
twenty-one,
And took a deep, long breath of pride for manhood
just begun ;
The days since then—thin, empty days—have
counted twenty years,
Years past recall as is the froth on all my bygone
beers.
Loves, prayers, fights, labors, triumphs, songs, the
wasted shadows pass,
And surely, surely I am weighed and written down
an ass.
Now sparkles every shining wave, and all the skies
are blue,
The hero struggles in my blood, I long to dare and
do;
Give but the hour, the man is here, strong will and
stubborn heart.
I spurn the touch of common things, the office and
the mart;
But when the sun with weary flame sets all the
West afire,
I gather to my drooping heart the dust of day’s
desire.
Then in the night I fold my hands and gently say
my prayer,
And all the words are tangled up with threads of
Mary’s hair.
And in the vision of my dream more thick the
shades appear,
With less of music, less of song, and more remem-
bered beer ;
Another cycle spins its course, the sounds and
shadows pass,
And every night confirms my faith that I was born
an ass.

The Unseen.
There is no flow’r that bloometh anywhere
Can waste its beauty on the desert air;
Fairer by far than anything man knows.
In fancied lands with clearest beauty glows
The unseen loveliness he pictures there.
No jewels that from human vision keep
In unscanned fathoms, where green waters sweep,
Waste aught of beauty or of lustre rare:
It is the knowledge of the beauty there
That makes our fancy turn towards the deep.
The sea allures us with its mystery
Of things unseen, the wonders that it hides;
And so sweet fancy, lured o’er many a sea, \
Buoyant with faith in the infinity
Of beauty everywhere, triumphant rides.
But if no flowers bloomed beyond men’s sight
Our fancies would be prisoners of night;
The unseen beauties equally we need
As those whose fairness is a lamp to lead '
Our thoughts through realms of wondering delight.
N.S.W.
HAMER.
The Haunted Paradise.
The moon is rising from the sea,
A bird is twittering in the tree,
And she I love, within the room,
Half-hidden by the scented gloom,
Is dreaming dreams luxuriously
The drowsy hours she waits for me.
Across the pillow’s dainty fold
Her errant tresses gleam like gold ;
An alabaster arm is laid
Where wand’ring moonbeams fall and fade;
Her bosom shows a contour sweet,
Where light and shadow dimly meet.
And though this room is paradise,
Hot tears are welling to my eyes—-
The little head that should be there,
Jet-black against her beauty rare,
Is sleeeping by the moonlit wave,
Deep in his little rock-bound grave.
N.s.w.

The Wooing.
The Sun-God from the highest peak
Flaunts wide his scarf of gold,
And as his burning glances seek
His Ladye Night, behold
Afar her dewy virgin brows!
Unnumbered leagues apart,
His gaze impresses glowing vows
On her illumined heart.
A god, voluptuous and fair,
In dazzling gossamer,
His glory diadems her hair,
His rare smile beckons her.
A palpitating, soft desire
Swims in her eyes, as he,
Whose ardor is a beauteous fire,
Grows dim and shadowy.
Vast the great passion of the sea,
Mysterious and deep;
But vaster the eternity
Of vows that ’tween them sweep
The moment ere he sinks from sight,
And she with flying feet
Hastes after, tremulous and white ..
But ne’er their lips may meet!

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves ) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any
part of the contents of this number is hereby ex-
pressly reserved by the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read and, where prac-
ticable, acknowledge in the “Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the
form of Political , Social or other Articles, Verse,
Short Tales or Sketches (those dealing with Aus-
tralian subjects, and not exceeding two columns in
length, or, say, 3000 words, are specially accept-
aote), Paragraphs, Letters or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS.
when the address is specified and stamps are en-
closed. But no MS. will be returned, or preserved,
unless these conditions are observed. When MS. is
forwarded without stamps for return it will be un-
derstood that the copy is to be destroyed if not ac-
ceptable. Personal applications for return of MS.
cannot receive attention. The Bulletin desires,
further, those sending MS. to distinctly understand
that it is not responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.
To Amateurs in Black and White.
Anyone supplying to The • Bulletin original
humorous or other topical drawings in line or wash,
of sufficient merit and interest and adapted for
direct reproduction, or any interesting photograph
illustrative of a current event, will be paid for same
on acceptance. Any picture containing a good idea,
but unfitted for direct reproduction — i.e., any pic-
ture which has to be re-drawn—will be paid for as a
suggestion only. The conditions under which such
artistic contributions will be received are those
applying to MS.
The Bulletin is forwarded direct to agents on
account of Messrs. Gordon and Gotch (wholesale

THE TRUST WHICH HAS HAD TIME
TO GROW.
According to a cable message which the
dailies printed last week—
The Standard Oil Company has been declared a
combination in restraint of trade. The Supreme
Court ordered the dissolution of the Company within
six months.
That is as far as America has got on the
road to scotching an indigenous curse, as
serious as the nigger problem itself, after five
years’ litigation, and an expenditure in Costs
that has been estimated at anything between
two and three million pounds sterling. No
matter how great and notorious a thief a
combine may be, the American Congress, like
the Australian Parliament, has no power to
summarily end its power to fleece the com-
munity. A fleeced people’s only redress lies
with the Courts. And the Courts can only begin
to make a show of protecting the people when
agreements by the combine or trust to re-
strain inter-State commerce can be legally
proved —-a job as difficult as that put upon
the late Sisyphus, or as any of the labors
imposed on Hercules, deceased.
* * * *
And now that the Court has given the
decision for which the vast majority of
Americans were hankering, the position, as
the oversea press notes, is likely to be just
what it was before the Court started to save
the country. The Standard Oil now owns
so much, one way and another, that to dis-
solve it would mean to smash up the com-
merce of America. As far back as six years
ago the New York Sun, a conservative jour-
nal, calculated that this one syndicate alone
owned :
Bank Stocks worth .. .. .. £46,620,000
Industrial Stocks worth .. .. 377,649,667
Railway Stocks worth .. .. 1,018,903^651
Other Stocks worth . . .. .. 400,000,000
Bank Deposits worth . . .. . . 83’973’668
Surplus for Dividend .. .. .. 20,000,000
Total £1,947,146,986
Nearly two billions sterling is a vast sum for
any comparatively small syndicate of men to
own. But the Standard Oil owns more than
cash and shares. According to reputable
U.S. publicists, it practically owns the Legis-
lature. Says Thomas Carl Spelling, a
conservative N’York lawyer :
The United States Senate may convene and ad-
journ, its members may speak to empty seats, prayer
may be offered, and the record publicly made at pre-
ceding sessions may be revised —all this may be done
without consulting the party boss of the majority
side. But no decisive vote can be talen on any
measure affecting directly or indirectly any important
Wall-street interest until he has viseed it, and it has
been passed upon by certain corporate directorates re-
presented by him. There every measure affecting anv
important business interest of the country is con-
sidered, and orders given by the boss to his party
following in the Senate. . . .Nor is this condition con-
fined to the Republican side. There is usually a
Democratic Senatorial representative of beneficiaries
of special legislation controlling in the same way a
small coterie of Democratic Senators, and voting
them on the monopoly side in support of “sane and
safe” policies.
So the Standard Oil will smile tolerantly at
the shafts of the U.S. Supreme Court, as it
has smiled at the futile efforts of the lower
courts, and at the States’ innumerable Anti-
Trust Acts. _ Time has rendered it unas-
sailable. It is the most horrible example on
record of the Combine that was not taken
in time —the world’s bitterest and loudest
gibe at the Tory idiot who babbles that “the
hour is not ripe,” and that drastic measures
should not be taken against a malefactor un-
til he is over the horizon with the booty.
It happens to be the best-cursed of America’s
Trusts, because it is the biggest. But there
are half a dozen others equally rapacious,
equally criminal, and equally injurious to
the people’s welfare. The Beef Trust, for
example, which has raised the price of meat
50 per cent, in America in the last four
years, is so situated that it is unlikely that
any Supreme Court or other legal decision
can ever touch it. It derives its license to
exploit the public from the fact that under
the. American Constitution, as under ours,
which was largely framed on that of Amer-
ica, the National Parliament is impotent to
interfere with a combine whose operations
are legal in the State in which it is regis-
tered. Tobacco, steel, sugar, leather, gas
and a dozen other trusts unite to make the
American pay moi’e for the necessaries of life
than any other citizen on earth. It seems
as though nothing but a revolution will ever
deliver the American from the toils wherein
he labors, as a result of his past short-
sightedness ; but, for the rest of the world,
his painful situation is useful as a standing
example of the way not to do things.
* * * *
Of course trusts existed in America before
the ’7o’s, when Rockefeller began his car-
eer. Bribery, as Bryce observes, both in
the form of transfer of stocks by corporations
to legislators, and gifts to them of free passes
and cash by railway companies, was known
in Washington 30 years ago. But most of the
business of the U.S. was not done then, as it
is now, by unlawful syndicates immune from
legal punishment, and bribery was not abso-
lutely rife. It would have been possible to
throw quite a number of stones in the neigh-
borhood of the Capitol without hitting a venal
politician. To-day, if the most respectable
classes of U.S. citizen and newspaper are
to be believed, an atmosphere of corruption
hangs permanently over the American Legis-
lature. Australia already has the trust in
a small way. The steadily-rising prices of
the past few years have nothing to do with
the tariff, as is indicated by a glance at the
home-grown products—bi’icks, bread, fish arid
so forth —which have increased in cost out
of all reason. And raised wages don’t begin
to explain the phenomenon. This country
is really in much the same position in regal’d
to trusts as America was a quarter of a cen-
tury or more ago. A certain amount of
damage has been done to the wage-earner’s
pocket, but not much. Our legislators may
not be all impeccable, but few of them are
corrupt so far. Nevertheless, they are the
same old variety of legislator at bottom that
America, Britain and the rest of the woi’ld
has known all through history—which is to
say, they will be liable to be coi-rupted as
soon as a trust or vend materialises with
sufficient money and unscrupulousness to
set about the business of corruption. The
proposition is as elementary as any in all
human nature. State Anti-Trust Acts are
futile, as American experience has repeatedly
shown. A combine can only be proceeded
against in the High Court when it has been
indiscreet enough to arouse the Crown’s sus-
picion that it has operated in restraint of
trade, and without due precaution in regard
to registration, in more than one State. The
only possible remedy is the Constitutional al-
teration asked for by the Fisher Govern-
ment last April, whereby the Australian Par-
liament shall have the power to proclaim a
business a monopoly, and deal with it ac-
cordingly. And the remedy wants to be
anplied soon. America, as a result of years
of inaction, is afflicted with a Legislature
which dares not prejudice the country’s thug-
like trusts. It is an appalling condition
which Australia must also reach, if it waits
long enough.
AN ADMINISTRATION THAT CANNOT
AFFORD TO LOAF.
Fob the first time in many years N.S.W.
has a Government that may be reasonably
expected to get busy, without delay, on some
of the big legislation which the State needs,
as opposed to the small, piffling legislation—
the strong measures against frail females
and so forth —with which Anti-Sosh has
marked time in the past. That reasonable
expectation is based on the fact that the
present Government can justify itself by
works alone. Unless it scores a deep mark
on the face of the Statute Book, and does it
soon, it is Lost. At the moment of writing it
is distrusted in more quarters, probably,
than any of its predecessors were at any
time in their careers. The disreputable atti-
tude of a majority of its members in regard
to the Referenda questions did not gain it
one genuine friend from the ranks of “Lib-
eralism.” On the other hand, it alienated
the goodwill of thousands of Nationalists
with Labor leanings, and threw a wet
blanket over hosts of hitherto-earnest Labor-
ites. To an Administration which exists by
virtue of a majority of one and the casting
vote of the Speaker, anything may happen at
any time. A death, a bankruptcy, or other
everyday event may put it where it will be
able to do nothing more spectacular for years
and years to come than utter the hoot
which cuts no ice, and the protest which is
of no avail. The Government must prove it-
self, and lose no time about the job either.
* * * *
And what a wealth of big things the con-
genital inactivity of Tory-bossed adminis-
tration has left Labor to do ! For a quarter
of a century the party which is now travel-
ling under the alias “Liberal,” has babbled
soothingly about the desirability of a North
Shore bridge or tunnel. Commission after
Commission has been appointed, has issued
reports and has had them pigeon-holed.
Thousands of politicians, mayors, aldermen,
prominent citizens and other liars have as-
sured the people, for electioneering purposes,
that the urgent work should be started forth-
with. But “Liberalism,” which lives by
the financial and other support of the kind of
people who own ferry shares, has never dared
to take the step necessary to mitigate the
danger which lurks in the overcrowded Cove.
It will be Labor’s funeral if it omits to put
a different aspect on the harbor tunnel
question before it goes out of office.
* * * *
With fatuous complacency the Sydney
press greeted the recent Census returns which
showed that the metropolitan area had swollen
in the last decade so outrageously that it now
lags but a little behind Buenos Aires in the
race for the most bloated city in the Southern
Hemisphere. No mention was made of
towns like Bathurst, whose population has
wilted by 25 per cent, since 1891. And a
dead silence was preserved concerning the
thriving towns that would have arisen at
Twofold Bay, Jervis Bay and Port Stephens
if the Governments of the past had consid-
ered the State more and Sydney less. The
present Administration, having nothing to
gain from Sydney’s Vested Interests, has no-
thing to lose by knocking on the head, or
lassoing, or otherwise putting out of action,
the present unnecessary Decentralisation
Commission, with a view to accomplishing
out of hand most of those things which the
Commission was appointed to hang up.
N.S.W. doesn’t require to be portentously in-
formed, by means of an expensively-acquired
official report, that it will be good business on
the State’s part to build wharves to accom-
modate oversea vessels, and lay out townships
at certain deep-sea ports, as a preliminary to
connecting these places by rail with the in-
terior. The proposition is too elementary.
Everybody recognises the justice and wisdom
of such a move, and everybody, barring the
little band that stands for the bloated capi-
tal’s Vested Interests—which is to say
“Liberalism”—has been saying so for year's
past. Labor has a unique opportunity here,
to give N.S.W. a reform for which it is
languishing. It must do it* or take rank
with the Sydney-bossed Administrations of
the past.
* * * »
A Court of Criminal Appeal has been
wanted for as long as the oldest inhabitant
can remember. Though criminal appeal has
been in vogue in England for over three
years, “Liberalism” in Australia has con-
sistently cold-shouldered anything of the
sort. Labor will do itself good by intimat-
ing in the only convincing fashion possible
that it has no further use for the old chain-
gang methods of crime repression.
* * * *
These are but a mere two or three of the
big things by its handling of which the pre-
sent N.S.W. Administration is going to make
or mar its fortunes for years to come. The
party is not situated like any other that the
State has known. Its position is that of the
desperate battler who must win in a few
punches, or lose the stake on points. For
years it talked about the things it would
do if it were only given the chance. Its
first effort of any importance, after getting
office, was about as democratic as a Legis-
lative Council; and it is still suffering se-
verely from the resultant slump. The time
has arrived when it must act quickly and
comprehensively, or hold its peace for many
a year to come; and a cheering feature of
the case is that it appears to recognise the
fact. *■
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Party Government and the Referendum.
In suggesting to the Fisher Government
that its duty was to resign after the ad-
verse Referenda vote, the Fat papers were
very careful not to call up Precedent to their
support. To the Tory mind Precedent is
usually a joss of the first class, but this
time he was just so much lumber, to be
thrown into the coalscuttle and forgotten.
As a matter of fact, Precedent leans with
all its weight towards Fisher ; an 18-stone
lady _ learning the bike doesn’t lean more
heavily on her tutor. Switzerland is the
only country where the Referendum is in
common use ; and questions submitted by the
Swiss Government to the people are gener-
ally hamstrung at first time of asking,
thanks to the machinations of P. Hinder-
prise and V. Interests— gentlemen wide
awake to the natural conservatism or inertia
of the mass mind, and tvho campaign accord-
ingly. In 1891 the Swiss Assembly de-
cided that the Railways should be pur-
chased from P. Hinderprise, but when the
poll was taken, the proposal was rejected by
289,406 to 130,729. Nobody resigned. In-
stead, the Government plugged away, and
six years later the proposal was carried by
386,634 to 182,718. In 1890 the law for
Federal Insurance passed the Assembly with
only one dissentient, while the Federal Coun-
cil was equally unanimous. H. D. Lloyd
and J. A. Hobson, in their book, “Swiss
Democracy,” describe the fate of the conse-
quent Referendum: —
During the interval before the Referendum a power-
ful and ably-organised opposition sprang up, outside
the ranks of the party leaders. Three prominent
journalists took the lead in rallying the opponents of
the law; costly circulars and posters were showered
all over the cantons ; an ettpensive campaign financed
by the insurance companies and by wealthy manufac-
turers, was put in operation. So successful was this
hostile propaganda that when the voting day came
the law was rejected.
Here we have an instance of Vested Inter-
ests being sufficiently unscrupulous or strong
to defeat a measure approved by the whole
Parliament. But nobody suggested that
Parliament should resign. Also, on April
13, 1910, the Australian Fusion Govern-
ment (now the “Liberals”) took a Referen-
dum on the 255. agreement. C. G. Wade,
V.C., then Premier of N.S.W.j and his Min-
istry gave that Referendum a fanatical sup-
port. They were badly defeated, but Mr. Wade
did not resign. On the same day the electors
found Wade guilty on another count' —the
State Debts Referendum. He barracked
loudly for “Yes,” but the “Noes” had it so
far as his own State was concerned. Yet
there was no record of Wade resigning
through a sense of fair play to the electors,
or for any other reason. Furthermore, the
rejection of the 255. agreement was a blow
to the prestige of nearly all the Australian
State Ministries; but their unanimity in
deciding that the “time was not ripe” for re-
signation was remarkable. Naturally, how-
ever, all these things have been conveniently
forgotten by the people who think that
Fisher should move out because as to two
planks of his platform the uninstructed, bull-
dozed public has hung up its approval for
the time being.
: — «
A Standing Jest Which Is Becoming a
Public Nuisance.
Mr. Levien's appearance with the ancient but
well-preserved Totalisator Bill was received with
shouts, some of derision and others of welcome recog-
nition of a familiar figure on the business paper.—
Sydney Telegraph.
For years past the above, or something so
like it that the difference does not matter,
has been regularly served up by the Sydney
papers. There is a damnable iteration
about the procedure of Harry Levien, in
regard to this white-whiskered Bill of his,
which grows wearisome. It is the ancient
legislator’s invariable habit, at the beginning
of each session, to tear in with an appear-
ance of enthusiasm on behalf of the Totalisa-
tor. Cavillers at the tote system of betting
are flailed mercilessly by Henry as enemies
of the State, ci-eatures of the “ring,” bad
sportsmen and so forth. Then suddenly the
entire uproar fizzles out. When the Bill
comes before the House, either the Govern-
ment Whip lodges a formal objection to it,
or some other wholly unexpected calamity as-
saults it. It drifts unnoticed down the
order paper, to subside ultimately amid the
business “held over till the following ses-
sion.” And then the jest, or whatever it is,
is repeated all over again. That is what
has been occurring for the past decade or so,
and it seems about time that it stopped.
It is recognised amongst practical citizens
that as long as racing exists there must be
betting. The only question the Legislature
has to ask itself is: What form of betting is
least harmful to the public, and hence most
beueficial to the State ? All the arguments
are in favor of the Tote. It gives the punter
a 50 per cent, better deal, lessens
racecourse corruption, increases the stakes,
and narrows the activities of a vast
army of “crooks.” The profits which
the Tote earns go neither in wine,
women nor song, but in the upkeep of useful
public institutions. No country which has
adopted the Tote has dreamed of reverting
to the bookmaker —in fact, the tendency in
these places, as witness France and Maori-
land, is to wipe the caller of the odds out
utterly. The only centres which continue
to endure the bookie are those in which any
sort of Vested Interest is notoriously hard to
shift. It is certain that 90 per cent, of those
N. S. Wales citizens who have considered the
subject want the Totalisator in preference
to the archaic, uneconomical and generally
rotten wagering system now in vogue. It
is up to the N. S. Wales Government to see
that Parliament has an opportunity to show
whether it does or does not feel the way the
counti - y does. There are at least two means
by which this might be achieved. Either
Harry Levien’s aged Bill should be put in
a position on the order paper where it must
be reached this session—that is. among the
first of the Private Members’ Bills—or, if
the Government considers the thing too big
to be put through by means of a Private
Bill, it might, with pei’fect safety, and the
certainty of much popular kudos, bring it
forward itself. It is not meet that a needed
reform should languish permanently in an
atmosphere of low comedy.
The Man Next Door.
Wherever there are two neighboring farmers,
you can be shre that one of them is longing
for a chance to buy the other out. And, if
the adjoining farm does happen to come into
the market, it is almost certain that it will
be bought by the neighboring owner, who
can afford to pay more for the second farm
than anyone else, because he can work it
a shade more cheaply. And so, all over
Australia, this sort of thing is going on: —
AGGREGATION. OF ESTATES.
Boort (Vic.), Friday.-—ln the olHer portions of
the maliee there is a growing tendency for the land
to lapse into larger holdings. At Cope Cope, which
is close to Donald, there, is an estate which is typical
of this unsatisfactory state of affairs. The man who
now owns it has gone on buying out neighbor after
neighbor, until his holding consists of land which
used to support nine families. At Boort there is
now one holding which used to support three families.
Another bad feature is that the land is being used
for sheep-farming, which of course means that far
fewer men are employed in the' district. These cases
show the necessity for having a clause in the provi-
sions of the closer settlement movement_ whereby a
man would be debarred from selling to his neighbor.
And the muddle-headed daily paper leaves it
at that. In Denmark, where 80 per c&nt.
of the farmers own their farms, and where
farms of 100 acres are rare, this evil was
noticed a good many years ago. The Gov-
ernment, with a very praiseworthy disi’egard
for “the rights” of the fat man, promptly
made it illegal for any man to own two
farms. This law has had such excellent re-
sults that Denmark never di-eams of repealing
it. In Australia, however, we are much
like the idiot who spends most of his time
chasing hens out of his front gate, while
he leaves the back gate open, and actually
sprinkles grain there to encourage an in-
vasion. We have the re-purchase of large
holdings by the State, and we have a prm


eressive land-tax which is hurrying bloated
Stages into the market. Thus the old
huge holdings are certainly being broken up ,
uf while the disintegrating process goes
1 in some districts, the opposite process is
in full swing in others —and sometimes in
the same. In poor times the present pro-
gressive land-tax might be sufficient t 9 stop
this grubbing together of farms ; but in the
recent good seasons the yield in any one
year is so great, in proportion to the capital
Value, that the tax is a mere flea-bite.
There are hundreds of cases in which men
have made £4 per acre per annum from land
valued at £l2; and with that profit in view,
the present small tax, on a basis of £lO oi
£l2 is hardly worth considering. Certainly
it would not stop one man in a hundred from
piling one farm on top of another. let now
is the very time when the piling-up process
is most lamentable from the national point
of view, because now is the time when new
farmers in unusual numbers are clamoring
for accommodation. Something more than
the present tax may therefore have to be
tried. It would do if it were swiftly pro-
gressive enough; but it isn’t—the man who
piles a £3OOO farm on to one of £4OOO has
only to pay a poor little £8 17s. 9d. per an-
num, or probably about 2d. per acre. To
secure a completely satisfactory law we shall
have to completely tear out the idea that
land —arable land at any rate —is a subject
for speculation. The idea must be rooted
instead that arable land is only something for
personal use, and that when a man can no
longer use it, he must be prepared to make
way for the man who will use it. _ We may
gamble in shares, or “hold for a rise,” with-
out doing the community much damage. But
when we gamble in land, or hold it for a
rise, we touch the very lifeblood of the peo-
ple. The community would not put. up
with the cornering of the water-supply; if it
were announced to-morrow that some specu-
lators had bought up nine-tenths of the water
in the Melbourne or Sydney reservoirs,
there would be a riot. Land is as essential
to the life of the community as water; yet a
dunderheaded community will let speculators
corner the supply of land, and farm it out
to the hungry, with never a thought that it
is making an ass and a beast of burden of
itself.
The Gentle Art of Squeeze.
Perth, having a syndicate tramway system,
begins to feel sorry for itself. Some months
ago the company had the usual trouble with
its workmen, or its workmen had the usual
trouble with it; and, when it was obliged to
do the fair thing, it promptly showed that,
anyhow, it could be top-dog in one respect by
cutting down the time-table, and thereby put-
ting the public to vast inconvenience. Evi-
dently the co. —a foreign concern —wanted
to be bought out —it reckoned itself among
those whose capital was being driven out of
the country by “Socialistic” legislation. The
inconvenienced public started the exnected
agitation; and then the harassed co. showed
how tremendously eager it is to get out of
this dreadful country by coolly asking
£600,000 for its rights and assets.
The municipal authorities gasped, knowing
that, according to the co.’s last accounts, the
total capital expenditure had been £474.274;
and a good deal of that represented partially
worn-out plant, and another part of it had
no doubt gone in oil and hot air. The
interested councils consequently called for a
report from a special board of experts an
engineer, a lawyer, and a financial man
and this board estimates the outside
value of the whole box of tricks at £376,000.
In fact, if consideration is given to its earn-
ing power, the financial expert puts the value
at £313,000, and even that includes £56,000
for goodwill. And goodwill in a case of this
sort simply means a payment made by the
people for their own custom. The matter
has gone no further, and, on present appear-
ances, in view of the wide gulf between the
two figures, it isn’t likely to yet awhile. The
fool-Parliament and municipalities let the
syndicate in after being gulled by the usual
rubbish about Private Enterprise being able
to do the thing better. Now, when the
gentle foreign capitalist shows that the pub-
lic convenience comes last, and the syndi-
cate’s profits come first, the public naturally
squeals, and wants the syndicate to go out.
But the syndicate won’t go out; it sees that
the more "it inconveniences the public, the
more the public will be prepared to pay to
get rid of it. The whole situation amounts to
a valuable lesson for those communities
which are inclined to job away their street
and other rights to the owner of the first
glib tongue that comes along.
The Sugar Cormorant.
That huge monopoly, the Colonial Sugar
Refining Co., showed a profit of no less than
£404,142 for the past 12 months. Not only
does it pay a 10 per cent, dividend on capital
which has been repeatedly watered, but dur-
ing the past 3| years it has capitalised
£575,000 of profit, a considerable part of
which it had never disclosed. Just over six
months ago, when it was explaining its big-
gest stock-watering transaction,, it men-
tioned that its investments in Fiji had been
so profitable that they had practically paid
for themselves: —
We are now able to say that our investments in
Fiji have been practically paid for out of profits, the
amount required for this purpose corresponding with
the earnings of our business outside Australia during
the last 15 years.
In view of the co.’s huge profits, and of this
confession, the Fijian planter, who supplies
the co. with the raw product out of which it
squeezes its money, concluded that the time
was ripe to ask for a few more crumbs. So
the Rewa Cane Planters’ Association met
and asked for better terms for its members’
cane. The reply it got ran this way :
In order to meet the generally less favorable con-
ditions of cane cultivation in your district, we have
hitherto curtailed the margin of profit to such an
extent that, with sugar at normal values, the return
on our capital invested at Nausori is quite insuffi-
cient. I can, moreover, add that, if the plant were
not already in existence, there would not be any
chance of our erecting- a mill on the Rewa. still less
of any other firm undertaking the work, unless the
cane could be obtained at a much lower cost than we
now pay. Under these circumstances, any advance
in the price we now pay for cane is out of the ques-
tion.
All this may or may not be true. This par-
ticular C.S.R. mill may have been treating
its suppliers with so much liberality that it
would be robbery of the widowed and or-
phaned shareholders to have paid another
ha’penny per ton. But it is pretty safe to
say that it would have been just the same
if the suppliers of any other mill had asked
for better terms. On its own. confession,
the co. has made so much money in Fiji that
within a few years the mills, plant, estates
and other assets have paid for themselves.
Now, when those cane-suppliers who think
themselves particularly badly treated ask
for some small concessions, in view of the
co.’s own admissions, it is met with —“Yes,
we have dong well. But not out of you!
Oh, no! You have been a drain upon us —
we have been really paying you too much.”
If we believe that yarn, it simply means
that the co. has been cutting more deeply
than we thought into the other suppliers. If
it had been making a large profit out of all
of them, it would be bad enough ; now, on
its own statement, the huge profit has been
made out of only a section. So, wriggling
out of one trouble, the co. merely lands it-
self in another. The time has come when
the co. will have to be faced, no
matter where it wriggles. For the plain
fact is, the co. has lost its sense of what is
a fair thing. A co. that will capitalise half
a million of profits in less than four years,

upon the actually paid capital, has forfeited
its claim to be left alone, particularly when
it handles goods which every household must
buy. And if it calls for upholders of Pri-
vate Enterprise to support and defend it,
this paper replies that the C.S.R. has become
one of the most dangerous enemies of Pri-
vate Enterprise in the Commonwealth ; and
the moment Private Enterprise identifies it-
self with such rapacity as this co. nowadays
displays, that moment it plasters on its fore-
head a notice —“Beware of this Beast. .It
is Dangerous. Perhaps you had better kill
it at once.”
• ♦—
The Good “ Sport.”
One of the grounds on which “Liberalism”
asked N.S.W. to vote for it at last State
election was that its leader was “a sports-
man.” In the days when C. G. Wade made
a regular practice of kicking, smiting, and
otherwise assaulting spherical objects of
divers shapes and sizes, he always, in the
words of “Liberalism,” “played the game.”
Anything savoring of sharp practice was al-
leged to be abhorrent to him. It is certain
that the persistent clamor concerning the
BAYARD-like qualities of Wade had a good
deal to do with Premier McGowen’s depart-
ure for the Coronation. Wade and the
Sydney dailies were urgent in their demand
that McGowen should attend this function
—“for the credit of the State.” When
Wade announced that he was prepared to
go so far as to pair with McGowen during
his absence, “Liberalism” was edified. It
stated that the offer was noble, and that it
removed McGowen’s last excuse for side-
stepping the London trip. And so
McGowen, satisfied that, while he was away,
his Government would be safe, departed.
And within the briefest possible time after
the assembling of Parliament, Wade was
hard at it moving the usual old vote of cen-
sure on the Administration with which he
had to all intents and purposes declared a
four months’ truce. Of course it may be
argued that Wade didn’t bind himself, in so
many words, to refrain from the precise step
which he took last week. But in all these
contracts certain matters are taken for
granted. The enthusiastic trout-hatcher,
tor example, who made a friend free of his
property, on condition that the latter didn’t
fish the river there, would not consider that
the bargain had been honorably kept if the
visitor, while scrupulously refraining fx-om fish-
ing the stream, got there just the same by dy-
namiting it. The sharp growls of disapproval
with which both the Sydney dailies greeted
Wade’s unworthy move indicated that they
gi-asped the strength of the position. These
papers don’t like Labor any more than they
did. They are as anxious as ever they
were to see the McGowen Administration
outed. But they are unwilling that the
thing should be done in such a way as to
blast their leader’s claims to be a “sport/’
and generally to cause the name “Liberal”
to smell more violently than ever in the
nostrils of fair-minded people. They de-
plore their champion’s act even as the
friends of a churchwarden would deplore an
attempt on his part to make 2s. 3d. by pub-
licly picking the curate’s pocket.
Judge or Handicapper?
Discussing an industrial matter in the Ar-
bitration Court the other day, Justice Hig-
gins remarked upon the fact that the Court
has always increased wages, and never re-
duced them. This circumstance has, ot
course, been repeatedly noted by the scornful
Fatman, who has thereupon demanded to be
shown the fairness of it. The Arbitration
Judge proceeded to oblige the scornful I at-
man in this fashion: —
It affords me food for reflection that, although
there is power to decrease wages, in every case which
has come before my predecessor and myself, the
Court has had to interfere by way of increase. 1 lie
reason seems to be that the employer needs no Court
to enable him to reduce wages—he has simply to de-
cline to employ at wages which he thinks too high.
It ought to be frankly admitted that the economic
position of the employee is too weak for him to hold
his own in the unequal contest. The power of the
employer to withhold bread is a much more effective
weapon than the power of the employee to refuse to
labor. Freedom of contract in such circumstances is
misnamed; it should rather be called despotism in
contract; and this Court ie~ empowered to fix a
minimum wage as a check on the despotic power.
Admitting all this, yet an employer often falls back
on an economic theory as to some law of supply and
.demand —a theory which I have found to be respon-
sible for much industrial friction. lie thinks that all
this regulation of wages is a defiance- of natural
laws. He treats this so-called law of supply and de-
mand as being, in matters of wages, more inexorable
and inevitable than even the law of gravitation. 1
refer to this theory because it interferes to a consider-
able extent with the attempts of this Court to secure
industrial peace; but it must be remembered that 1
have to administer the Act, and that phrases and
theories of political economy should be addressed to
the Legislature, not to the judicial organs.
In other words, the supplier of labor, if left
to himself, doesn’t get a sporting chance. It
is an “unequal contest.” The Legislature,
having frankly l’ecognised that much, has
set up the Arbitration Court, not to merely
record the knock-out blows, or to register
how many lengths the winner won by—not
to act simply as judge, but rather as handi-
capper. And since the employer can always
win without the handicap, it follows that,
in order to make the contest more equal, the
work -of the handicapper is always to give
the employee a lift. So far as these industrial
relations ‘are concerned, the law of supply
and demand is hung up; and, instead of
there being anything outrageous about that,
it is merely following the precedent of every
kind of sporting contest.
Sweet Charity, or Sweat Charity?
From Frank Henty, of Melbourne: —-
Melbourne has a concern which is pretentiously
styled the “Charity Organisation Society of Vic-
toria.” It is a sort of soup-kitchen and cheap-doss
affair, issuing tickets to its patrons for re-issue by
them in lieu of cash charity-doles. The C.O.S.
“looks into” cases of distress, and organises Mel-
bourne’s “charity” to such an extent that, during
the 12 months ended 30th ult., no less than 93
nersons were found employment.
It is this employment with which I am concerned.
From a return with which the secretary has cour-
teously favored me I have obtained some truly
shocking particulars. It appears that during f*! 10 '
11, the patrons of the C.O.S. permitted themselves
to employ four unfortunates as “useful men at 10s.
per week and keep! Thirteen “usefuls altogether
were given employment; and it seems incredible to
me that four men out of 13 should be so broken down
and valueless as to be “worth” only 1 9 s - PfL w ® e , k
and keep. Two of the 13 “usefuls” received 12s 6d.
and keep ; five found a temporary home and victuals
with a job, at 15s. per week ; and two of them were
paid 1.75. 6d. and keep. Out of the whole 13 use-
ful men,” not one received a pound a week! 1 re-
fuse to believe that the patrons of the C.O.S. have
not taken some advantage of these men.
Next take the office-cleaners. These are women,
and one of them was employed at 10s. a Week no
keep Three received 155., one drew a guinea, and
another reached the massive wage of 4s. per day, or
night, or both. Surely, at a pinch, the patrons of
the C.O.S. could “spring” a trifle on these cut rates,
in sweet charity’s name —on the ten-shilling rate
Pil Three gardeners successfully approached the C.O.S.
One found a billet at 30s. per week (ss. a day, or
less) without keep; another at 40s. a week (6s. Bd.
a dav, or less). A third drew 275. a week, and
found. If these gardeners were any good at all, the
C.O.S. got them at bargain rates —and ’charity,
which is comfortable enough to back up a. C. 0.5.,
should be above bargain-hunting in men s labor.
The C.O.S. placed one clerk at 30s. a week. So
far, Victoria has not obtained a Wages Board for
clerks; and, as the C.O.S. patrons are probably well
aware, 30s. a week is not a wage which- is likely
to be included in the over-21 schedule once that
Board is established. In the meantime, the C.O.S.
natron takes advantage of open competition and the
necessity of the C.O.S. provided-clerks and gives
him 30 bob! If that is organised charity, I m for
Socialism and the nationalisation of the poor-box!
The ruling C.O.S. rate for charwomen is 4s. a day.
At this wage, 27 women were employed by the
patrons afore-mentioned, the average length of ]ob
during 1910-11 being 13 days each.
The ruling C.O.S. rate for “men”—laborers, pre-
sumably—is 6s. per day. Of these “men,” 33 were
given employment during the year at the rock-
bottom rate of 65., the work averaging a trifle under
four days each. .
Out of the 93 men and women, therefore, 60
“men” and charwomen can be counted out, because
their billets were not billets at all —unless 13 days’
work in the year is a “billet” for a woman, and
four days provides any sort of a man’s job worth
then, a list of .33 employees, of whom 23
have already been mentioned. Of the balance of 10
persons, two cooks were given a job at 255. and
found, one cook at 355. and found, a clerk at 405.,
one axeman at 425.. two axemen at 485., a general
servant at 125., and another of the l4s. No
work was found for any “general” at 155.. 17s. 6d.
or 205.. despite the “dearth of domestic help. And,
to conclude the list with fireworks, and amid loud
cheers and applause, a job at no less than 60s. per
week w r as rounded up for one brush-finisher.
In replv to criticism, the C.O.S. will inevitably
wail that' it is better for a man or a woman to
have a poor job than no job ; and the reply of the
indignant anti-sweater is that Australia is pros-
perous enough to have no poor jobs—if “charity”
were organised in a proper manner.
Note, in conclusion, that this blessed Society is
backed up in large part by gentry of the type which
has of late been so ready to prate on the platform
and in the pulpit concerning “liberty,” the “new
unionism,” “amity in industry” and “union
tyranny.” Is this the . result of their “liberty” and
“amity in industry”? It mostly looks like dirty
sweating to me.

David says he didn’t fall :• —
In “Plain English” (B. 11/5/’ll) on “How
David Fell,” you have been kind enough to quote
from my remarks on Federation (not particularly the
Referendum), when I digressed from my criticism
on the last N.S.W. Budget, and to make a deduction
as to the “Liberal” method of “bringing party rebels
to heel.” Had you quoted the following extract side
by side, I would have had no reason to complain:
“Assuming that the Federation will go on when we
have passed away, and that honest men in the Federal
Parliament will legislate in a fair manner, I main-
tain that some of the powers now asked for are
reasonable and necessary for the development of Aus-
tralia as a whole.” And, further: “If we could get
some uniformity with justice, then any Parliament,.or
body of people in Parliament, who would bring
about uniformity on the lines I have indicated, are
on right lines.”
My remarks to the effect that if our party were in
power we should have no objection to the course
proposed, had reference to the state of party feeling
existing over a high Constitutional question of this
kind. 1 have always advocated, as far as practicable,
a uniformity of State and Commonwealth laws, and
have endeavored to avoid connecting myself with the
political clique which applauded the wire-netting
episode, and for that reason did not associate myself
with either Liberals or Labor in this question. The
manner in which the questions were drawn up, and
the bunching of them, involved fiscal and econondc
factors, and, as I have always been (and still am) a
Freetrader, and have never been a Protectionist, let
alone a New Protectionist, nor do I believe in the
fixing of prices, I was left with no alternative but to
reject the whole. Neither do I believe, as a Federal-
ist, in handing over to a central authority the power
to “regulate and control” State or domestic affairs;
had the words “regulate and control” been elimin-
ated, possibly I might have got into line.
At the last Referenda I joined issue with the
Liberal party, which is proof positive that I am not
bound by party caucus in my political views.
It is obvious from the result of the last two
Referenda that the Australian public will invariably
cast a vote on the negative side unless the questions
are raised above party strife, and both sides can
arrive at a common basis.
With regard to my silence you are in error, as on
several occasions I gave mv views to my constituents
when assisting Colonel Ryrie in his campaign. If
I was not reported, it was not my fault, but my mis-
fortune.
I am not usually honored with the quotation of my
speeches of a higher calibre when they are not in line
with The Bulletin’s policy; nevertheless, judging by
the criticism by your good selves of your daily con-
temporaries as to their one-sidedness, one would
assume that you are “never for a party, but always
for a State.”
In reply, The Bulletin merely—
(l) Remarks that David stumbles again. This
paper is always one-sided. But it isn’t always on
one side. When David is right, it is with David.
When Absalom is right, it is with Ab. Which is
apparently what David can’t understand in a paper.
(2) And quotes David again: “It is not the first
time I have declared myself on the question of the
Federation as against the State. If young Australians
have any national sentiment they recognise the
greater potentialities of the Federation against those
of the State. I find to my political embarrassment
that, whenever a Federal question comes up here, I
am entirely out of touch with the members of my
party. The Liberal party has, unfortunately, to my
mind, always put up the State against the Federa-
tion, and the party will always go down. If ohr
party were in power we should have no objection to
the course proposed. Speaking now for the Federa-
tion, I say that it should have the power which it As
sought to give it.”
After which The Bulletin sorrowfully
comes to the conclusion that David Fell
first, and Wriggled afterwards.

The Official Year Book of the Com-
monwealth, prepared by Statistician
Knibbs, improves with every issue. The
first number contained numerous inaccur-
acies ; the second contained a few. But
Knibbs, wise enough to confess his falli-
bility, encouraged corrections ; and one can
turn now to the volume with the utmost con-
fidence. And with profit as well as confi-
dence. The State Frighter, for instance,
will get great joy out of such harmless-
looking remarks as these :
In order to protect the interests of users of arti-
ficial manures, legislation has been passed in each of
the States. The following is a list of such Acts in
force: —-
N. S. Wales. —The Fertilisers Act of 1904.
Victoria. —The Artificial Manures Acts of 1904
and 1910.
Queensland. —The Fertilisers Act of 1905.
S. Aus. —The Fertilisers Act of 1900; amended
1903.
Westralia. —The Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs
Act of 1904; amended 1905.
Tasmania. —The Manures Adulteration Acts of
1893 and 1898.
As regards their main features, these measures are
practically identical.
And to pass these practically identical meas-
ures about manure, the people of Australia
paid 12 Houses of Parliament, and 12 sets of
Hansard reporters, and 12 lots of millin-
eried officials, and, after that, they paid for
publishing 12 lots of debates ; and then they
got six different sets of laws, practically
identical, yet varying just enough in details
to provide traps for the honest but unwary.
The more the Australian thinks of the glori-
ous privilege of doing all this to regulate the
sale of manure, the more shuddersome must
be the very thought of such a thing as Unifi-
cation. Anyway, the Australian evidently
counts these things a glorious privilege, be-
cause when the other day he had a chance
to give one or two more of such jobs over
to the Commonwealth Parliament, he voted
No.

Trouble is looming in connection with the
Adelaide tramway employees. The men
want the Trust —which represents the muni-
cipalities—-to recognise the Union and meet
it in conference when necessary. The Trust
says it is perfectly willing to do this as long
as the Union contains no outsiders. The
“outsiders,” it seems, are chiefly the secretary
and the president, so a deadlock has oc-
curred. The men say that the secretary
has far too much clerical work to do to be-
come a satisfactory motor man, while T.
Byan, M.P., the president, isn’t looking for
a bell-pulling job. and the Union isn’t dis-
posed to sacrifice him. Goodman, the man-
ager, professes that he can’t see anything in
favor of a system under which any “out-
sider” is admitted to the union. If Good-
man had been in Sydney three or four
months ago his eyesight might have been
better; for just about that time the gas-men
struck unanimously because the co. sacked
a union secretary. As J. C. Watson, the
arbitrator, subsequently decided, there never
should have been a strike; but whereas the
co sacked the man for being drunk, the
union thought that lie was sacked for being
a conspicuous unionist. After groping
The Drivel That We Buy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 search my daily paper through to find en-
lightenment
Upon the tangled problems of the day —
To seek a light to clear the gloom, and doubt
to circumvent;
A mental sign-post pointing out the way.
But I still search for them in vain; they are
not there to find;
Instead of them, it seems, at least to me,
The object is to further cloud the puzzled
human mind
With strange remarks of great obscurity.
The time is never “ripe” to cure the most
most oppressive ills
The body politic may suffer from.
Especially if the ailment’s Fat, the publica-
tion thrills
Lest vague discredit fall on Christendom.
“Let us not be over-hasty ; a time will come
some day;
Be certain you are hurt before you cry;
Mature procrastination will anxiety allay”—
And that’s the sort of drivel that we buy.
The weaker curse injustices that grind hu-
manity ;
The hungry ask for food instead of laws;
The Morning Tbipepot urges calm, and
pleads for Sanity—
“ The spirit of the times should give us
pause.
It’s strangely incompatible with tolerance of
thought
To fly in face of economic facts;
It means the lessons of the past will simply
go for nought,
And once again the money mart distracts.”
Say another Saviour rises, or a Moses
cries, “Advance —
The Promised Land awaits us o’er the
hill,”
Observe the Daily Dollop, with its pancake
vigilance,
Strike platitudes from out a goose’s quill.
“The basis of Society,” it says, “must fall
to dust
If every Socialist may justify
The uprooting of foundations. ’Tis bound
to Sow distrust
In London, where our next loan prospects
lie.”
Just literary cabbage, served without the
salt, and cold —
Each day the same old wad to stack away.
From a brand of cook, with cob-webbed
views, that Fat makes in the mould
The First Fat used to make his system
pay.
And I lift myself distracted, to yell that
Time IS ripe
For prints wherein the pen will glorify
The cause of Man in place of Cash, and loose
Oppression’s gripe
Instead of this d —d drivel that we buy.

about in the dark for a few hours, Fat, who
had thought just the same as Goodman
seems to think now, came definitely to the
conclusion that, if he had to risk a strike
every time he sacked the executive officer of
a union, the sooner those officers were off
his wage-sheet the better.
At the opening of the N.S.W. Parliament
Carruthers spoke his little piece in favor
of borrowing. To Joseph it seemed “pre-
posterous” that we, in one generation or two,
should “do all the work necessary to open
up this country, to span it with rail-
ways, to make, ports and harbors, to do all
that work which had cost other countries
thousands of years to do.’’ Apart from the
fact that no country has been spanning it-
self with railways for a thousand years, or
a fifth of it, does lou know any country
which, doing a public works job a thousand
years ago, passed the billon to this generation?
It is quite true that the development of
some other countries has taken a thousand
years ; but the bill for the job was paid as
the job was done. The modern Briton isn’t
therefore paying interest on the cost of the
ancient Roman roads —in fact, he isn’t pay-
ing interest on the road that was made even
50 years ago. The development of Austra-
lia will take a thousand years, too; neverthe-
less Carrutiiers’s wild, shiftless, selfish idea
is to pay for nothing to-day, but pass the
whole bill on to the future generation, which
will have quite enough to do to renew the
works that are being built in this genera-
tion.

• Randolph Bedford writes :
Here, in the Bigilt, I idly looked at an advertise-
ment of this shipping co., and read: “Travel in
luxury by the Orient line.” Well, I don’t, but I
travel in safety. The Ophir is a solid ship with a
past. If you object to the rather hash-foundry menu
they tell you that the Duke of York travelled on the
Ophir II years ago. True; and still the menu can-
not compare with that of a coaster of the A class;
and the shower discharges of the bath have been
painted over and over, so that the holes are stopped
up and can’t say anything, and when you turn on
the tap one wry-neek pin-prick spits at your ear,
and another falls to the south, while another cock-eyed
delivery squirts at your big toe. The saloon is like
a pantomime transformation scene by that old-time
artist, John Hennings, with chubby-faced, undressed
females standing at each wing, as it were, with
lamps; forward to starboard you see the entrance
for the goddesses who must wear purple tights, while
aft, on the port side, is the entrance for the ladies
whose tights must be rose-pink. But she is safe,
having been built before shipping cos. had the trick
of breaking down the margin of safety by crowding
on top hamper. On the new liners there is more
luxury. Is the safety less? You see them, ships of
all lines, towering over the wharves, 50ft., 60ft.,
70ft. above the water, and then you look at the fore-
foot or the sternpost, and see that there is about 26ft.
or 28ft. below the water-line to keep a grip on the
centre of gravity. Then you say over to yourself
the names of the ships that have gone and of those
that will go if they but carry the pitcher to the
well long enough. These over-sea ships must have
big tonnages, great passenger accommodation —and
light draft to carry them through Suez. In the
Waratah case evidence was suppressed and newspapers
were silent —British newspapers nearly always are.
In the remount scandal an outspoken man called for
the hanging of the traitors who sold worn-out Hun-
garian cab-horses to Britain, so that British soldiers
might be still further handicapped in the Boer War.
lie was answered with indignant little shrieks of
“Bad taste!”' “Rotten form!” “Let it drop!”—
anything to save from discredit our great merchants
and our ruling classes. Similarly, in the Waratan
inquiry, evidence was suppressed. More accommoda-
tion was asked for. The builders replied that the
Waratah was already close to the limit of safety.
They were asked if the additions would come inside
the Board of Trade regulations, and being told
“Yes,” were ordered to go ahead. For that and
other reasons it is a good thing that J. M. Fowler,
M.H.R., is determined to urge the Commonwealth
Government to re-open the Waratah inquiry at the
Commonwealth end; for if the British mercantile
marine lost a ship, Australia lost people. A loss
doesn’t affect a co. much. Out of the profits it
makes by running ships, sometimes cranky, it puts
by a fund to pay for another cranky ship" when the
first cranky ship is lost. Make them sky-scrapers
above and mere publichouse cellars” below,
and they’ll pay dividends, until one day there
comes the more than usually long arc in the rolling,
and the pressure of a cyclone on that gigantic fabric
in the direction of the roll, and then another ship is
gone. We cannot tell these people how they shall
build their ships ; but we can make a high standard,
and prevent ships that cannot come up to it carrying
passengers to or from Australia or on the Australian
coasts. In almost every case of maritime disaster,
short of shipwrecking by careless navigation, we find
many expert people who Condemned the ships before
they were lost. I hear men talking so of the Yon-
gala, which is gone, and of others which have not
gone, and which I must not mention —because such
mention would be libellous. I know of one such
top-heavy crank steamer, trading in the Coral Sea,
which cannot keep an even keel for half an
hour, and when she’s gone I’ll print her name.

From the Old Soldier:—
The news that M. Berteaux has been killed, and
Monis, the t rench Premier, half killed, by a falling
aeroplane, will do a lot to mitigate the Kaiser’s
complacency over his enthusiastic reception in Lon-
don. The present French Government, which only
took office in February, was a compromise. Before
it could be formed Monis had to reconcile Ber-
teaux and Delcasse. These two able and mas-
terful men were members of the Cabinet which was
wrecked in connection with the first row about
Morocco. Delcasse held the view that Germany
did not mean business over the Moroccan trouble —
in fact, was bluffing. Berteaux, who was Minister
for War, grew nervous, possibly because he knew
more about the state of the French Army than Del-
casse did. Delcasse was jettisoned, and the
Kaiser’s smile of gratification did not wear off for
months. That Berteaux was in a genuine -tate of
panic is evidenced by the fact that he hurriedly got
credits for several millions to put. the country’s
fortifications in order, and provision the great fort-
resses. Delcasse is now Minister of Marine;
he is the clearest-headed Minister of modern times,
and is alleged to have been in control of the foreign
Office for some time past. If the Premiership re-
verts to him, Germany will have fair cause to curse
the aeroplane.
Though the Nose party got a majority in
the Referenda, the argument which the party
screeched loudest has had a hole punched
through it. “If these proposals are car-
ried,” yelled the “Liberal,” “it will mean
unification, and the dreadful absurdity of
governing the outlying parts from one
centre in the south-east corner of the con-
tinent.” By way of reply, the outlying
parts voted Yes-Yes at the top of their voice;
Westralia, North and West Queensland, far-
out'Broken Hill, all joined in the chorus.
It was the inlying part—the part that was
to do the governing—that said No, No. From
all of which it is clear that the outlying parts
were prepared to trust Australia, while the
inlying parts were not prepared to trust
themselves.

“Under Two Flags,” the adaptation of
Onida’s thriller which started to wave at
Sydney Adelphi last Saturday in place of
the remunerative “Bad Girl,” is a brisk,
warm-toned play pervaded with the smell of
explosives and punctuated with gunshots.
The imported low-toned bellow usually con-
tains a large proportion of London fog,
snow, poverty, gloom, shivers, cellars, nar-
row streets, green limelight and undertaker-
ish top-hats. But after Act 1, “Under Two
Flags” escapes from the London atmosphere
and goes into exile, sunshine and bright gar-
ments in Algiers, with beneficial results to
all hands, including the scene-painter. The
dramatist, seconded by the Adelphi staff, has
packed into the four acts the chief incidents
of the book, including Cigarette’s ride; and
although some of the speeches—notably Cig-
arette’s dying oration —are too long, the dia-
logue mostly holds the attention.
* * * *
Ethel Buckley, as Cigarette, the central
figure after the drama has put on its bright
garments, plays at high tension, and in the
heavier scenes appears overweighted ; but a
young female of the Cigarette type would
have that appearance in real life if she ever
escaped into it. Robert Inman, as Bertie
Cecil, looks too staid to assault London
policemen, or to merit the reproaches of the
most furious Pa ; but as the gloomy, Arab-
slaying Louis Victor, of 12 years later, he
gets a .stronger grip. Lord Rockingham,
his faithful friend, is well handled by John
Cosgrove. As Colonel Chateauroy (Black
Hawk), Harry Diver has to sneer through
three acts, endure various rebuffs, and finally
be baulked of his revenge and surrender his
sword. It is a thankless job, but he gets
through it skilfully, managing to look dan-
gerous to the last. The bustling Wilton
Welch, the faithful valet, is a comedian
most of the time; Nellie Ferguson makes of
Princess Venetia Corona a restful, gentle
personage; and others who die off early, and
a few who remain to the bitter end, are not
distinguished enough for special notice.

“Jack and the Beanstalk” is still doing

“The Gay Gordons” continues to supply
Criterion audiences with large quantities of
kilted humor, fair girls, and bright music.
The wild Highland solicitor, mentioned by
this paper last week, has returned to his
native heath, or something; and Archibald
Sneedy, who brings the glad news that Pri-
vate Grseme is an Earl, now closely re-
sembles the common or garden variety of
Shark, whom Sydney knows so well.
R. Shortland, an Australian, is responsible
for the new interpretation.
There is a whispered warning in the advt.
of “The Dollar Princess” that that tuneful
lady will not attempt to rob the Gibbs sales-
lady of her long-distance running record.
For one thing, the Princess is a resurrec-
tion ; and a modern comic-opera lady in her
second time on earth is usually scant of
breath, even though she be still fair to out-
ward seeming.

This day (Thursday) John Philip Sousa
leads his band back to Sydney Town Hall
after his melodious descent on Maitland and
Newcastle. The interrupted season, it is
announced, will last “till further orders”;
but this paper has a strong suspicion that
the orders will arrive early in June, for
Melbourne already has its hand to its ear
and is getting impatient. Owing to the
Town Hall being otherwise engaged, the
Saturday matinee wil be given at the Adel-
phi, where George Marlow hangs out his
sign.

The Columbia Comedy trio, a clever team
of burlesque operatic singers who make light
of Faust, and Miss Blanche Charmeroy, a
dainty French comedienne with a drawing-
room style, are Sydney Tivoli’s latest acqui-
sitions. The Seven Perezoffs continue to
keep the air full of plates, cutlery and orna-
ments ; and the astonishment created by
Reichen’s carefully-inverted dogs is only
eclipsed by the howl that goes up when the
small, four-legged clown of the troupe calls
him a liar by turning down a placard with
his snout or paw. Cad well and Verne, Ted
Kalman, the Ivavanagh Boys, and Vaude and
Verne are other performers who help to keep
the box office busy.

At the Sydney Lyric Dante’s Inferno is
being reeled off to crowded houses. Mar-
vellous how the diseased imagination of
Dante draws! Outside the Lyric one finds
one audience eagerly waiting to take the
place of the one inside; for the J. D.
Williams Theatres are run on the continu-
ous principle, the programme taking up but
an hour, with the prices cut accordingly.
At the Colonial No. 1 the star production is
a consipiracy under Henry 111. of France,
and conspiracies in those days meant a
good deal of blood-letting and neck-stretch-
ing. At the Colonial No. 2, the funeral of
the late Archbishop Ryan is an attractive
draw for the faithful.

“The Woman in the Case” appealed to the
“feelin’ ’eart” of an average crowd at Mel-
bourne Royal on Saturday, and there was
more than the usual uproar over point one,
outraged innocence, hnd a clamorous demon-
stration, amounting to a protracted breach
of the peace, over point two, the triumph of
virtue. Sydney appears to have shown ex-
ceeding fondness for Clyde Fitch’s crafty
contrivance, and Melbourne will probably
respond in the same affectionate spirit, since
this latest American confection combines the
crude, everlasting interest of “The Wickedest
Lady in Liverpool” with sufficient of the
science of effective staging and just enough
literary finish to gratify semi-intellectuals,
who §corn the Yellow drama. Really “The
Woman in the Case” falls short of greatness
by just about a mile and a-quarter. It is
a clever play of four acts and only two ac-
tions ; yet, brief as it is, several of its
characters are inconsequential, and one act
is a superfluity. Everything has happened
and the available materials are done with
when Margaret Rolfe takes the female with
the dissolute hair by the neck, and bats her
coiffure against the furniture. But Fitch
wanted a bedroom scene, bedrooms being as
much in demand as superlatively wicked wo-
men ; consequently we get Act 4 with Mrs.
Rolfe in her little cot —a rash act just long
enough to restore the loved to the arms of
the beloved. This necessity of getting Jack
and Jill into holts at the finish is the bane of
every dramatist who hasn’t the courage to
leave something to the imagination of his
audience.
* * * *
The three people who really matter in “The
Woman in the Case” are the wife, the lawyer
and the other woman, for, when all’s said
and done, the husband is only a pawn in the
game, and a good, easy actor like G. Iv.
Souper cannot make him seem to be quite
worth while. Hugh Buckler justifies good
opinions formed of him when he frivoled
in crackling American farce hereabouts, and
his Lawyer Thompson is quite as good as
Clyde Fitch permits, Fitch being a play-
wright whose characters too often lack the
essential spark. This spark is missing in
Klauffsky, the improvident Israelite, out of
whom Arthur Cornell gets no true trace of
humor. But it is the women who really
matter, and two pronounced conventional
types have strong exponents in Miss Mabel
Trevor and Miss Elinor Foster. The parts
are acted on their merits in their proper
vein, which is deliberately melodramatic.
Miss Trevor dashes furniture about to em-
phasise her sublimest points, and she gives
things a swing when they most need it.
Without her verve the drama might be flat
and unprofitable. Miss Foster’s is a broad,
strong, impressionist picture of the bad girl
of the bunch, the girl who has a good ex-
cuse for her exceeding wickedness in the
weird redness of her hair. No woman could
be a pattern of propriety with a head of
hair like that —it is one of the scarlet sins.

Still seeking reasons for the “Gibbs” epi-
demic, already afflicting a numerous class in
Melbourne, The Bulletin finds that it has
almost all the elements of popularity, in
which respect it is very like beer. The

elements of popularity in musical plays are
obviously not those that commend tnemselves
to the serious souls who contemplate the
union of stage and platform. An ex-
ponent of the Higher criticism is as much in
place at a showy show like “Our Miss Gibbs”
as a prize stallion might be in a collection of
dried butterflies. One may as reasonably
quarrel with the gifted management of a
Punch and Judy matinee for neglecting the
masterpieces oi Ibsen, Hauptmann, Gals-
worthy, and G. Bernard Shaw as rail at the
glare and glitter of chronic opera in the in-
terests of the sublime drama. It is as well
to admit that these elaborate concoctions of
shimmer and jingle, chatter and chiffon, have
practically lost all relationship to dramatic
art, and to consider them in a sphere apart
which has its own standards of excellence,
however frivolous and fictitious. This is
really the mental attitude of thousands of
people whose brains have many facets, and
who do not find that the capacity to chortle
over a spiced olla-podrida like “Our Miss
Gibbs” on one night, detracts in any way
from the sombre and appropriate joy they
take in a fine performance of “Othello” an
evening later. By the way, not the least
interesting feature of Miss Browne’s perform-
ance as Miss G. is its demonstration of the
fact that one may be a successful singing
soubrette without having a voice in the
matter.

“The Third Degree,” of the interesting
waits and some incidental acts, was repro-
duced at Melbourne Princess’s last Saturday
night. The revival, which was for three
nights only, provided the usual employment
for Miss Katherine Grey. As the plucky
missus of Howard Jeffries, jun., she plunged
through the play, greedy for the delights of
half-weepy conversation. As for the others,
Beauty could have asked no more than Wil-
liam Desmond supplied as Richard Brew-
ster. Sporting a heavenly expression, he
looked like a classy, sassy and passe imita-
tion of the Stranger in “The Third Floor
Back.” His acting, however, was consist-
ently good—a remark which applies also to
that talented person, Cyril Mackay. Winter
Hall, as Jeffries pdre, supplied rather a
cheerless portrait of Winter Hall; while
other parts were taken by Leslie Victor,
George Bryant, and Miss Alma Vaughan.
Last night “The Lion and The Mouse” was
to reappear, and on Saturday Hugh Ward’s
Company( without Hugh Ward) will com-
mence a merry season with “Seven Days.”

The bushranging at Melbourne King’s
comes to a finish to-morrow night. For
Saturday Bill Anderson announces the first
appearance of “The Executioner’s Daugh-
ter,” from the diligent pen of E. lifll-
Mitchelson. The “Sorrows of Satan,”
which was expected to succeed “The Squat-
ter’s Daughter,” is seemingly laid up with
influenza, or cold in the nose, and will not
be seen for a week or two.

At the Opera House, Melbourne, R. A.
Roberts is discoursing airily as eight dif-
ferent people in “Ringing the Changes,”
which is a less artistic and more mechanical
sketch than the Turpin item. Respecting
other performers, the Two Lillies, with the
mirror illusion, have lately been added, to-
gether with a bright little party called Peggy
Pryde. Peggy, who is as vociferous as ever,
is still in the role of a Cockney lydy with
her grammar in deshabille.

The Federal Government achieved a novel
record last week, when two of its members were
fined, one in a N.S. W., the other in a Vic. Police
Court. The Acting-Prime Minister had to pay
£3 for “obstructing” Moore-street, Sydney, by
delivering a political address; the Postmaster-
General was asked for £2 by a Victorian magis-
trate because the Postmistress-General refused to
allow her first-born to be vaccinated.
South Australia’s most inveterate writer-
to-the-papers died the other day—E. K. Miller.
He didn’t “enter the Church ” till he was close
on 30, yet he had 63 years of it, mostly at Willunga
among the hills, where you can live 80 years
without once waking up. He was a sturdy old
chap who wasn’t to be put down by a mere bishop,
and when he wasn't advocating the Willunga
railway he was getting tremendous letters pub-
lished (even if he had to pay for them) pointing
out to the gaiters that they were so wrong as to
be in danger of hell-fire.

Portion of the story of King Henry VIII.,
according to Shakspeare and Beerbohm lree,
was pictured at West’s Building, Melbourne,
last Saturday night. The t ™ ly If wond ?
production, which takes over half an hour
to unroll, includes some. most cleverly-
managed spectacles. Nothing could be finer
than the banqueting scene, wherein Henry
gambols in infatuated pursuit of Anne
Boleyn; “Blacltfriars Hall” and the Corona-
tion of Anne Boleyn” furnish magnificent
crowd effects; while “Wolsey’s Downfall
deserves a word for the impressive acting of
Beerbohm Tree. Yet, in the matter of act-
ing, even Tree is surpassed by Arthur Bour-
chier as the famous King—there seems to be
not a gesture lacking, not an attitude wrong.

Last week the Prahran Lyric (Vic.) filmed
“The Black Curtain,” for the discourage-
ment of Tertium Quids. Early in the pro-
ceedings a wife and co-re. are found giving
expositions of the double hug. Follows a
poignant scene wherein T. Quid, trussed up
by the vengeful husband, is accidentally shot
by the ladv. This week the Lyric is screen-
ing “La Tosca,” and bags the usual contri-
butions of loud applause. The picture is a
choice production, the part of Floria being
taken by a beautiful woman with a fine taste
in hats and frocks.

An American conjurer and illusionist call-
ing himself “Nicola” is making . his first
Australian appearance at the Jubilee Exhi-
bition in Adelaide, and no other building in
the city would hold the crowds that he
draws. Many of his tricks have been seen
before, but he pushes the art of deception to
its limit. The principle has to be accented
that there is some simple way of getting
an empty cabinet full, or a full one empty.
The remaining skill lies in finding new ways
of leading up to the discovery ; and that is

where Nicola scores. He finishes his even-
ing by shaking himself out of handcuffs and
lashings, in full view of a usually tumultu-
ously cheering crowd. The Tivoli is still star-
ring the Potter-Hartwell trio, and making the
audience glad it came. The Royal has had
a benefit performance for the mother of the
late Grattan Cpughlan. And West’s Pic-
tures have been showing “East Lynne,”
while the Wondergraph has given “La
Tosca,” and the Lyceum “The Mystery of
a Hansom Cab,” and a faithful picture of
“The Fall of Troy”—faithful because, of
course, the camera can’t lie.
“Nardoo”: “Locust” (B. 6/4/’ll) won-
dered what had become of Dick Yongala, the
cat well known for so long to passengers by
the steamer which disappeared a couple of
months ago. Glad to say my old friend
wasn’t in the Yongala at the last; he stayed
behind on the Grafton wharf. Whether
Dick is a prophet or not I don’t know, but,
anyhow, that’s what happened.
“Torbane”: The N.S.W. State Ministry
has decided to erect saleyards for stock, and
when these are completed the meats will be
brought in Government trains to Government
saleyards and slaughtered in Government
abattoirs. Why not complete the process by
having them sold by Government auction-
eers? The producer and the consumer be-
tween them pay vast sums to various people
for doing very little; the managing director
of one company gets £lBOO per year, and
other companies declare big dividends. If
the State completed the job the charge to
the owners of stock could be 4 reduced, and
the man on the land would be correspond-
ingly benefited. Curiously, however, the av-
erage man on the land has been bluffed in-
to believing that the people who bleed him
of totally unnecessary commissions are his
triends, and all others his enemies.

WHAT EVERY BANDSMAN NEEDS.
[Fob The Bulletin.]
J. P. Sousa said the successful concert conductor
must possess soul. The musicians must catch his
every thought and impart to the music the inspira-
tion he feels. He had always believed in the effect-
iveness of conducting in curves.— Daily paper inter-
view.
No thinking person will dispute
The demonstrable fact
That Soul’s a priceless attribute
In band-conducting. Packed
And cheering halls greet harp and flute.
Bassoon and double-bass and lute,
When Soul informs their Act.
And so with Inspiration. Hordes
Of music-lovers come
And revel in the crash of chords
When It is there. Folks drum
Their gamps and feet upon the boards
And cheer (such pleasure It affords)
Who’d, else, sit still and dumb.
Yet is there still another gift,
Most precious in the eyes
Of him whose job it is to lift
Band music to the skies.
To lack it constitutes a rift
In band-craft’s lute which none may shift—
The power to advertise !
N.s.w. M. SAFRAN.
“Vagabond” : I’ve just Sousa-ed, and enjoyed it all
the wav, as oft I’ve done before in various parts of
the world. He’s the all-right acrobat with that little
swizzle-stick of his, isn’t he? But, big as my ad-
miration is for the Toot-toot-two Step King, I’ve
always felt that his audiences over-estimated the
value of his left hooks and uppercuts. Don’t you
think the piccolo would be just as tremulous without
the fingers twiddling at him? Don’t you reckon the
big drum would butt in just as accurately in the
dead centre without that jerk of an imaginary
string? Doesn’t it strike you that the cornet and
the trombones and the triple-barrelled brass instru-
ments would be just as ferocious without that frantic
baton sawing off the atmosphere and flinging the
pieces to the dogs? I figure it that the chorus cuts
off like a steel rat-trap merely because that’s how
the score says it is to shut up, and not because the
lid is banged down with both hands by friend Sousa.
I’ve got a suspicion that he might start the item and
then sit down and read the newspaper comfortably,
and his band would get along just as well as it does
now. Not that it’s any the less credit to the bearded
pard if it is so —the more, rather, because it would
show how well he has trained his crew. Yet, as a
matter of business, I suppose he’s right. The people
pay just as much to see him and his energetic
counters and right-crosses and double-handed punch,
his hypnotic passes, cut-and-thrust-exercises, wood-
chopping contests and flag-wagging gesticulations as
they do to hear his band. So he gives them the
goods they come for.
By arrangement with Hugh J. Ward, his late com-
pany of mummers passes to the control of Reginald
Wykeham, his right-hand man for six years, and
William Low, who looked after the front of the
house and kept the cheque-book in its proper place.
Both of them are capable and popular, and are not
downhearted at the prospects, despite the loss of
Ward and Palotta. The season opens at Melbourne
Princess’s on May 27, in “Seven Days,” with Robert
Greig in Ward’s old part. After Melbourne, the
country towns of Victoria will have an excuse for
smiling, with probably “the East” to follow.
“Kaylce”: Nicola, a Yankee magician just arrived
in this countrj' with veteran H. P. Lyons as pilot, is
alleged to. go one better than anybody else in the
handcuff business. He certainly goes several better
in the advertising. “At Cleveland, Ohio,” says the
gentle puffer, “he was chained to the track of the
Lake Shore railway a few moments before the fast
mail, that is scheduled at 90 miles an hour, was due.
As the engine whistled at the 1500ft. limit, Nicola
began to release himself, accomplishing the feat in
seven seconds.” The picturesqueness of a manacled
Houdini falling from a bridge into a deep, dank
river fades away when compared with the spectacle
of one large train tearing down on one small Yankee
at the rate of a mile and a-half a minute, and threat-
ening to leave nothing in its wake but an obituary
notice.
Randolph Bedford’s lecture tour, which he had
suspended to walk about alonga bush, positively be-
gins on June 1, with G. V. Allen, who piloted Foster
Fraser, to. lead the bear with the bald head. Bed-
ford’s lectures won’t be lectures, but talks —confi-
dential talks to as many people as like to pay. They
cover the White, Yellow and Brown men of the
Pacific; Uncle Sam’s Women; the Trusts and the
Revolution; the Downs-and-outs of New York ; and
types met by the man who travels in Italy, and
New . York, and London, and Central Australia, and
Japan, and Papua. A bad authority says that the
yarns of the Chewing-gum Trust and the man who
was found out are alone worth the money. Albury
begins the tour, to console, it for hot being the
Federal Capital, and then by quick jumps to Bris-
bane and the big, warm North.
Sylvia Blackston is taking her contralto to U.S.A.
by the Makura on June 5, having been engaged by an
agency for a long tour. She has lately had glad
tidings of her first waltz composition, “The Eruba,”
which has just reached its 56th edition. Each edi-
tion is 1000 strong. Paling and Co. were the
first to publish it, and a London firm has it in
hand on the other side of this mud-ball.
Harry P. Lyons, who is still “on the roads,”
brought Blondin to Australia in 1875, and was with
Cooper and Bailey’s Circus in ’77. When he first
visited Adelaide with a show he pitched his tent
on the site where Langdon Bonython is now amass-
ing a fortune with The Advertiser.
“Monkbarns” : Refreshing to find some antiquarian
who can sniff a whiff of romance out of Melbourne’s
Cremorne, now, to me, obliterated. The place was
founded by James Ellis, who had managed London’s
Cremorne in succession to Edward Tyrrell Smith,
L.L.’s dad. Ellis also had a big steam gondola
built on the Yarra; it plied between Toorak and
Melbourne. The Cremorne Pagoda was a gorgeous
white bridecake-looking affair; the orchestra played
on it, and there was a dancing platform all round.
There was a menagerie, too, with a big elephant and
a camel. Coppin and Brooke, as partners, leased
both the Theatre Royal and Cremorne, in 1856.
When they quarrelled, in 1858, Brooke took the
Royal, and Coppin took Cremorne. The most won-
drous of his Artful Dodges was an affair called
“The Grand Gift Enterprise.” Then there were his
fireworks. The first big show of that kind was the
Siege of Sebastopol, painted by Wilson, so long
identified with Sydney, father of Frank Hawthorne
and Carden Wilson. A circus came later. At one
time and another Coppin built four Melbourne
theatres, the Olympic, Pantheon (at Cremorne),
Haymarket, and new Roj'al (after the fire of 1872).
The Pantheon was a wooden place, which witnessed
some surprisingly good performances. “Jack and
the Beanstalk” pantomime was played there in 1860.
“Saladin”: Nelly Nandooka was a half-caste girl on
a Central Australian station, and though she was
up to a lot of points where sheep and cattle were
concerned, she didn’t know much of the ways of
Mother Grundy. There was a fortune in her as a
circus rider, and when Burton’s show came along,
the boss wanted to take her away and train her.
Nellie wouldn’t go, but she was easily persuaded to
join the show for one night. She rode a couple
of buckjumpers and bullocks, and ended with riding
the old ring-horse standing on a pad-saddle, amidst
the uproarious applause of the station hands. As
she took the prad out into the little back tent, there
was a yell for an encore, and Burton hurried out
and asked her if she could do the turn “bare-back.”
“Mv word —easy!” said the flushed Nelly, and off
went Burton to announce it. Two minutes later, when
she rode into the ring—well, clothes made no differ-
ence to Ellen.
“Propstick”: Glad that “W.F.” arises to vindicate
me in a mere opinion of Hoskins’s limits as an actor.
I knew the facts, but was so grieved at having hurt
the nephew of this excellent comedian that I had
said with Hamlet, “The rest is silence.” Now let me
place on record where Hoskins went far beyond any
actor I ever knew, and probably beyond any ever
known in Australia. This was" as a Shakspearian
student. If any man could get near the motto of
the Melbourne Shakspearian Society, “Would I
knew his mind!” it was William Hoskins. Those
who knew him as I did remember his wonderful
conversation on any one of the plays which might be
brought up. He seemed to know by heart even those
which are never acted. The smallest character be-
came to him a living being, and I remember him
discoursing at length on Potpan, an obscure servant
in “Romeo and Juliet”—Potpan the Unready. He
had a real Hazlitt faculty. You had only to mention
Timon of Athens, Cressida, William in “As You Like
It,” the Clown in “Twelfth Night,” or any most out
of the way thing, and he would start at a tangent
with illuminative and enthusiastic remarks. James
Smith, Neild and such Melbourne men exulted in his
company. But, with all this, his histrionic gifts were
limited, though he had the glorious deficiency of not
being able to perceive it. Because Hamlet was as
his own brother, he thought he could act Hamlet,
and did once in Melbourne. So with his Richelieu,
which he once acted in the same city. Naturally he
was grieved at the lack of appreciation of Shak-
speare by tragedians like Brooke and Sullivan. They
never wanted to talk about Shakspeare. They were
mere tradesmen compared to Hoskins; but then they
were executants. Never, either, let the magnificent
services of Hoskins to Irving be forgotten. In
young Brodribb Hoskins found one who drank in his
Shakspearian lore with avidity; and he got up early
'in the mornings to give Irving gratuitous instruction.
Hoskins, after vainly persuading Irving to come to
Australia in 1856, obtained for him his first engage-
ment, at the Theatre Royal, Sunderland. Irving
would have come to Australia, I believe, but for his
mother’s entreaties.
“Briner”: Someone wants a Mexican drama. Well,
there is the grand old “Sea of Ice,” adapted from
the French for Webster and Celeste, at the Adelphi.
It used to be familiar in Australia in the days more
nautical, when Ned Holloway exulted in “Ben the
Boatswain,” “My Poll” and “My Partner Joe,”
“Black-eyed Susan,” “The Dream at Sea,” and “The
Lonely Man of the Ocean.” They called him Hollow-
away. (Not to be confounded with the Plain Wil-
liam and Charley crowd, which extended to Essie
Jenyns, Alice Deorwyn and charming Beatrice.) The
first act of “The Sea of Ice” was in the Arctic
Regions. (What price the South Polar?) The vil-
lain wrecked the ship, but the captain’s baby
daughter, of course, floated away, safe on a block of
ice. In the second act, she had grown up into Oga-
rita, the Wildflower of Mexico. This offered a
sharp contrast of tropical summer after icy. winter.
The villain turns up. Aha! She discovers, fasci-
nates —and knifes him! A rattling piece! With
every goodwill, I cannot find the good old “Octo-
roon” kind of backbone in modern dramas. The
authors seem to write with tongue in cheek, guying
us, taking us out of winding, pulling our leg.
“Stargazer”: I see Mr. George Cross has been
blowing the melodramatic actor’s bugle. According to
George’s theories, as communicated to the Press, a
man who can act in melodrama can act in any-
thing, because it is only in melodrama that superb
acting is called for. You must act your part in
“The Worst Barber in Bungaree,” but in really good
plays “the parts act themselves.” So? I have seen
“Hamlet” played some scores of times, and must say
that in most cases, if the part acted itself, it acted
itself dashed badly. George’s laudation of the ener-
getic melodramatic “artist” reminds me of a bit of
appreciative criticism I once heard in the gallery of

Martyn Hagan and his wife (Lucy Fraser) take a
benefit send-off in Melbourne early in June; they
leave then on a Vancouver engagement. Lucy Fraser
has sung to a generation and a-half of vaudeville
gods, and Martyn Hagan was well known in the
remoteness of last century as a queer comedian of
the sort that wears a green coat and a red waist-
coat, cord pants, and a lunatic pot-hat. For
years that are too many to count, Martyn,
in that rig, has been beating the floor with
a blackthorn stick and crying “Hurroo!” and now
that he is going to do it in some other country,
Poverty Point throws a nosegay at him, and wishes
the pair luck.

“Harrison O.”: Under advance Gregan McMahon's
new Melbourne repertory theatre scheme, the first
production will be St. John Hanlcin’s “Two Mr.
Weatherbys,” to transpire at the Turn Verein Hall
on June 26. Said hall, by the way, will accommo-
date 500 persons, which is 200 more than can be
squeezed into the Fog hamlet’s Court theatre. Later
on McMahon hopes to produce “John Gabriel Borlc-
man,” “The Voysey Inheritance,” “Waste,” “Can-
dida,” “You Never Can Tell,” “The Devil’s Dis-
ciple,” “Justice,” “The Trojan Women” (or Euri-
pides, translated by Australian Gilbert Murray),
Maeterlinck’s “The Intruder,” Maxim Gorky’s “The
Night Shelter,” Tchckhov’s “The Sea Gull,” and a
couple of the literary excursions of the late W. Shak-
speare. Australian' stuff is also promised. LeGay
Brereton, Louis Esson and Blamire Young all have
little things of their own which they want to intro-
duce to the public.
“Signboard”: When N. J. Gehde played his
“Storm Fantasia” recently, the lights of Sydney
Town Hall were repeatedly flashed in the faces of an
approving audience; whereupon there were some
mildly disparaging remarks from one of the critics.
The cultivated music-lover apparently resented the
composer’s action in using electricity to drive home
his meaning. One might almost as reasonably object
to a lecturer using lantern slides to illustrate a
reading. The musical critic is apt to forget that
the ordinary person likes his emotions marked in
plain figures. He realises, and readily admits, that
he is unable to find out for himself the exact mean-
ing intended to be conveyed by a series of sounds;
so he is glad of an explanation. The critic is not so
honest, and resents all help. As a matter of fact,
the only persons who can translate sounds accurately
are the" men employed on building jobs, officers of
ships, and others who know exactly what the other
chap means when he gives two blasts of his whistle.
When the critic tries to describe the music of a
composer like Greig, the best he can do is something
like this extract from a daily paper report of a
Oarreno concert: “It was really Greig, what you al-
ways get when you hear him properly done —a lovely,
ornate atmosphere without fragrance, an exquisite
emotion without passion, queer harmonic distor-
tions, which sound as though twisted by the frost,
and a very plentiful sprinkling of melancholy,
musing and elfish gaiety.” That is altogether too
hazy for the plain music-lover who wants either an
air or fireworks with an explanation. If a musician
were asked to tell a friend by means of a fiddle,
piano, organ, trombone or bass-drum that he would
meet him next day at 12.15 opposite the G.P.0., he
would probably burst trying to do it; his friend
would burst for a certainty if he made an earnest
attempt to understand it. Music hath limitations
as well as charms, and it is a wise musician that
recognises the fact. Marshall-llall used to put long
explanatory notes on his programmes, and they
helped his audiences considerably. We yet may see
an orchestral conductor using moving pictures to
illustrate the meaning of his uproar.
The London music-hall managers who want to put
on “sketches ” that are simply well-known plays
boiled down have agreed to a sort of compromise:
not more than six “principals” and not more than
30 minutes in duration. All the best of pretty-well -
anything can be run in on those lines, from “Char-
ley’s Aunt” to the “Cloches de Corneville.” “Madame
Butterfly” (without the music) is the latest. It is
hoped to arrange that nothing shall be used till it
has fairly served its turn in the regular theatres —
say, for 15 years.
London Referee got from Dion Calthrop, novelist,
playwright, and author of a four-volume “History of
Costume,” an advance idea of the dresses to be worn
at the Coronation performance of “Money.” Lytton’s
play was first produced in 1840, and is being garbed
accordingly: hero in gorgeous dressing-gown and
smoking-cap, the Club scene in the picturesque
Early Victorian evening-dress, the ladies in ringlets,
with tiny parasols and enormous brooches, and the
men “will, of course, all look more or less pigeon-
breasted,” with strap trousers, stock-cravats, and
whiskers. George Alexander, as the hero, gets the
dressing-gown and smoking-cap, while Cyril Maude,
is in a reproducion of the costumes Charles Mathews
used to wear.
“Stargazer”: The Katherine Grey Co. provided a
Melbourne night’s entertainment, with the aid of
“Arms and the Man,” without much regard for one
George Bernard Shaw. Desmond got pretty near to
the author’s plain intention as Bluntschli, and the
two old people were in order, although Susie
Vaughan erred with the clowning device of hauling
the sleeper from his bed by the leg at the end of
Act 1. My chief grievance was the drift to broad
burlesque throughout, with Cyril Mackay as first
offender. He over-acted SaranofF, and made him a
consciously farcical figure, whereas he is a sober pre-
sentment of human frailty of quite a common order.
Shaw shoots Folly as she flies, and it is unseemly
for his actors to belabor the body with a stuffed
club.
“Snell”: Re Leslie Holland’s imitation of Kirby,
and Kirby’s life-like reproduction of Leslie Holland.
The reproduction in living clay of London comedians
who have made a notorious hit is now a large and
profitable industry. Take Alfred Lester, for in-
stance. Having fashioned and finished Peter Doody,
the lugubrious jock in “The Arcadians,” he was
carefully and accurately reproduced for export by a
score of minor comedians, who have introduced Doody
to as many English-speaking communities. Down
To the smallest detail all is Lester. Yet no doubt
in each case a new comedian has been hailed with
great public rejoicing.
“Terence”: Latest greenroom yarn about George
Grossmith, who has had remarkable success with his
readings in America. On his return to England he
somewhat boastfully compared the art of entertaining
with that of acting. “You fellows,” he said to
Charles Brookfield, “have to take out scenery, pro-
perties, plays, and a large company when you want
to perform ; while I —look at me. I just landed in
New York with my piano and a dress suit, and I
made £7000.” “I daresay,” snapped Brookfield.
“But we don’t all look so damn funny in our dress
suits.”
THE FIDDLER’S FATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I play my fiddle night by night,
1 hear the heavy villain rave,
I suffer all the hero’s skite,
And see him fatuously save
His loved one from a wat’ry grave.
I writhe to hear the maiden gas
Her sentiments beneath the oaks,
And suffer keenly while that ass,
The low comedian, provokes
“Great laughter” with his awful jokes.
The poor old father dodders round,
The anguished mother dies again,
And, like some horrid peepshow wound
With keys, they dribble through my brain,
The horses and the cardboard train.
I play my fiddle, and I dream
Full soon King Death may come to me;
And then I shudder, for ’twould seem
The fiddler’s special Hell may be
To play while through the aeons dree
Damned drama trickles ceaselessly.

JUST WHAT HE ME ANT TO SAY.
IMPECUNIOUS MUSICIAN: “The true artist is
not a business man; he requires a'manager
to make him a success ."

IMPECUNIOUS M. : “ Yes! That's just what I

The superior fossil who talks about “ un-
thinking people” was unearthed by the Sydney
Telegkaph again the other day to vent some
remarks apropos of the Japanese encampment at
Vaucluse. He was alleged to be “a Sydney pro-
fessor ” and he said : “The suspicions that have
been entertained regarding these gentlemen are
altogether discreditable to Australians. Cer-
tainly the choice of a camp tended to raise the
suspicions of unthinking people.” If the alleged
professor had done a little thinking on his own
account, he might have seen that the point is not
whether the Japanese are scientists or not. but is
as to the wisdom of allowing any band of foreign
strangers to camp within spying distance of the
few poor defences which the chief Australian
naval station possesses. Even a professor ought to
know that there is enough space in Australia out
of spying distance of the defences to accommodate
them comfortably.
“Vagabond”: “Neptune” says there
is no boat and fire drill on Australian pas-
senger boats. What can you expect ? On
our inter-State liners it’s scurry into port,
bustle up alongside the wharf, tear the
hatches off and bundle the cargo out, rush some
more in, scuffle the passengers aboard and pant
off to sea again. The lowering of boats, which is
the part of the performance that is worth anything
at all as practice, can’t be carried out at sea; so
when is the drill to get a look in ? Some of the
bigocean-goersdohaveabiteasier timeofit in port,
and I have seen some of the German’s lifeboats
out on the harbor for practice. In fact, I met a
dishevelled procession of them the other early
morning; but the sight of the white-faced and
white-jacketed stewards strenuously catching
crabs, and manfully struggling to find out which
end of the confounded sail ought to go up top of
the pole-thing, didn’t re-assure me as to the
chances those boats would have if the circus came
off on a pitch dark night in a sea that was turning
itself inside out and back again in short breaths.
No doubt some of the Piebald-crew lines aren’t
keen on advertising the sort they carry in the
stoke-hole by dumping them in open boats and
parading them round the harbor ; but in spite of
that, isn’t it time someone in authority and a
brass-bound suit walked down and gave an order
that at least every other month all the boats must
go out for a swim, with every man Jack of the
crew aboard them?
* * * *
From an Australian mining engineer in
Mexico :
“ Australia ! ” The name hit our little camp in the eye
last night (22/3/T1). We wolfed the item in the paper—a
message from Kl Paso, across the border in Texas, saying
that 600 Australians, mostly ex-S’Afrieans, want to come
along here to j 'in the Revoltosos in the insurrectionary
inix-up. “ You’re an Australian, you are an ex-
S’African,” said the camp. “So it’s up to you.”
I have been mixed-in close with the revolution since it
started, both in Sonora and Chihuahua, and know condi-
tions 6s they are. I would hate to see a bunch of my
comrades come across here to fight with this outfit. The
cause of the revolution is all right, but white men can-
not come down to the level of the people who are fight-
ing; and the fict that they do not know the language,
customs or manner of carrying on a revolution in a Latin
republic like this would be discouraging when they
realised conditions. In the fight at Casas Grandes, as
soon as it started, the Mexicans ran and left the Ameri-
can “ foreign legion ” entrapped where they had to bear
the brunt, and they were slaughtered. It is the same all
the time. The revolutionists have no cannon or machine
guns, neither have they transport or pack outfits to
amount to anything, and they have practically no
ammunition beyond what they carry in their belts, and
no regular source of supply. Martial law is now a fact,
and Diaz will take few prisoners. They go from one
town to another, ami, though foreigners are not
molested, they hold the natives up for money, horses or
anything they can get.
It is not real fighting like we had in S’Africa. When
they do get into a fight they bunch like sheep, and at
Agua Prieta the other day, before Diaz’s soldiers went
into battle, each man was given a bottle of mescal so he
wouldn’t run away. The result was that, though i hey
were too drunk to run, they were also too drunk to shoot,
much less shoot straight. They fired about 6000 rounds
and killed two rebels, while 14 Indians with the rebels
killed 13 soldiers. Most of the revolutionists have never
had a rifle before, while the soldiers are made from con-
victs. When a peon is convicted of a crime, instead of
gaoling him they put him in the army. You can guess
the result. Also, there is no pay for services ; so, if my
countrymen want to come here as soldiers of fortune,
they will get very little fortune. They can do much
more good for their land and themselves by remaining at
home and putting in their fight for the protection and
advancement of the Best Country.
Yes, it’s the Best all right. Since S’Africa I have been
over a good many countries that are worth going to, and
a few that are not; but barring none, Australia is the
finest in all respects. I expect to be back again to stay
about next Christmas. lam as fond of adventure and
fight as any of those men can be, and would be in this
one were there anything in it. But there isn’t; and if I
do any fighting for another country I will be mighty well
paid for it. For the other sort of fighting, there is only
one country that's worth while. So let’s keep out of this
scrap. There is nothing in it. No money, less glory : for
I could take the 500 men mentioned in the clipping and
whip the whole Mexican army, and then turn round and
whip the Revoltosos with what was left.
Without intending to do it, the Law in
Victoria has strewn boulders in the path of those
playful people who practise the gentle art of mid-
night flitting. Attention was drawn to the matter
the other day when a carter, who had borrowed
his employer’s furniture van to remove his house-
hold goods to a new abode, discovered in court
that by doing so after hours— i.e., between 7.30
p.m. and 7 a.m.—he had rendered himself liable
to a fine. The Minimum Wage law under which
this regulation was made provides for a permit,
which would have been readily granted in Ids
case; but the Factories Inspectors are hardly
likely to grant permits to shift the sticks of per-
sons intending to get the better of the. landlord
for a couple of weeks’ rent. For a minute or two,
the Right Thinking landlord took quite a kindly
view of Progressive Legislation.

An interesting point was raised when the
Sydney Clerks’ Union, which is busy preparing
for a Wages Board, was considering'the “ log” of
claims to be made. The question that arose and
hit the body in the ear was : Should clerks be
indentured or articled as apprentices? Unex-
pectedly vigorous arguments were used in favor
of a system of apprenticeship ; under the present
system, it was shown, boys are taken into city
offices, given no real instruction in any branch of
clerical work, afforded little or no opportunity to
pick up any special knowledge, and left unfit to
be clerks and too old to become anything else.
There was a sufficient number in the union im-
pressed with the importance of the proposal to
refer it to the executive for consideration.

“ Snaffle ” : I have a note from my friend
Centaur, who has been on a visit to Luneville,
the principal French cavalry station. The
brigadier in charge was most affable, declaring
there was nothing to hide. Said he: “There is
no diplomacy in cavalry—it is downright work.
The great difficulty is lack of horses. In that
respect Germany is as bad as we. Each Power
can only find 60,000 efficient cavalry at the out-
side. Russia is the great country for horses.
Little, yes, but good. In the Boer war the ignor-
ance of English cavalrymen was very conspicuous
—I talk of their
careof thehorses.
The sacrifice was
awful. Never-
theless, that war
showed the im-
portance of
mounted infan-
try.” Centaur:
“Yet the English
War Office made
an absurd mis-
take. At first
it stated that
only infantry
would be needed
from Australia,
and no cavalry.”
Brigadier: “Aye,
is that so ? We
have a report
from the re-
mount officer,
stating that the
Australian horse
has deteriorated, through racing.” My friend
urged what he could on the other side, but
naturally got in return only a polite “ That is the
report,” and a shrug which meant “If I have
hurt you, I am sorry, but ”

The spirit of curiosity possessing me, to-day I
went round to four different offices armed with a

me variously twopence, threepence, twopence-
halfpenny and three halfpence. Needless to say
I posted at the three-ha’penny office. At this rate it

THE FEMALE RELATIVE: A PLEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How would any of them personally feel if they could
come back some day from those realms to which one
was said to go and find a female relative sleeping in a
washhouse 'l—Judge Box, of Melbourne.
There are few things less appealing to a spook of proper
feeling
Than to journey from the Mansions of the Blest,
And discover that its mother, whom it worshipped as none
other,
Has a wash-house for a place of nightly rest.
That industrious appraiser of the Globe, J. Foster
Fraser,
Never once, in all his travels, had to shrink
From the loathly apparition of a female of position
Plunged in dreamless slumber and a washhouse sink.
Men may act like rakes or friskers and grow beer stains
, on their whiskers,
Deeds which operate to make the doers vague
Re the venue of their couches; ret the most besotted
slouches
Shun the washhouse brand of bedroom like the plague.
Scores of little comforts which in, say, the pantry or the
kitchen
Are discernible by anyone of sense,
Must be lacking from the washhouse—be the dwelling-
hall or hash-house.
This is obvious to all, however dense.
Without more circumlocution, let us make this resolution :
Be the loved one mother, sister, cousin, aunt,
Grand or great-grandmother, slumber ’mid the damp and
flies and lumber
Of the washhouse she emphatically shan’t.

Maoriland has been talking Eugenics for
several months, and Wellington has formed a
society to see what it can do in the matter of
appropriate mating. Some of this talk of race
purification has reached the ears of Lionel Terry,
the man who blew a Chinaman off the face of
nature in Wellington six years ago as a protest
against the encroachment of the alien : and from
his cage in the Sunnyside Asylum (Christchurch)
he has torpedoed the following lines :
“EUGENICS” IN PIG-LAND.
They call me mad because I broke
A law that breeds damnation ;
And yet they pray for Christ to come
And lead them to Salvation.
They brag about their British blood
With “ Trumper” animation :
While in their slinking slums they breed
A piebald population.
Life without honor is impossible,
And honor hath its source in pride of race :
Therefore, when Mammon’s law admits the alien,
The prison is the Patriot’s Proper Place.
Which comes signed: “Lionel Terry, Rebel.”

Chief Justice Madden (Vic.) has had
another great day ; it came with the opportunity
to let himself go at great length and with much
fury on the question of deserting husbands. As
usual in such cases, Judge Madden had heard
only one side of the case, and one yarn is always
good till the other is told. Possibly on this day
he was right; just as possibly he was wrong. Any-
how, he was unjudicial. But, apart from that,
one remark of his Honor’s calls for attention.
He said that it lay heavily on the Parliament to
introduce legislation that would compel husbands
to support their wives—“in gaolif they refused to
do so out of it.” The fact is, there is already
plenty of legislation in force to enable a wife to
gaol her husband if he won’t support her; the
trouble is that there is none to make him support
her when he is in gaol. Yet when the woman
wearies of this foolishness and asks the Law to
disconnect her entirely from the waster, some-
times it says: “Oh, you both of you want
a divorce, do you?” and refuses the decree with
emphasis; and at other times, while it permits
the decree, it makes a large quantity of untidy
remarks which scarcely touch the real reform
required. And that is prison reform—the setting
of prisoners to do work which will yield some-
thing to the prisoner’s family as well as to the
t-'tate.

Cleanliness is next to godliness ; and
often, like other next-door neighbors, they don’t
speak. The health officer of Moorabbin (Vic.)
shire council lately reported that a local clergy-
man’s back yard was the most filthy he had ever
seen on private premises. The official naively
added that he had not reported the matter before
because the parson’s daughter, who had been
suffering from typhoid when he called, had died
a few days later. He further notified the bumbles
that in the west riding alone, there had been two
cases of typhoid and 36 of diphtheria. The
“local authorities” seemed to have a lurking
suspicion that something ought to be done, but
decided to wait till the shire engineer and an out-
side expert had prepared a comprehensive report
on the drainage of that district. What an inval-
uable sheet-anchor a “ comprehensive report ” is
to the party of No Progress !

better, in a White Australia, to keep up the sign

case is that he went broke in the process.
Dr. W. H. Hosking, of Masterton (M.L.),
who has been recently passing some severe stric-
tures on the administration of the Cook Islands,
tells the story of
a recent murder
there. It appears
that there had
been some trouble
about a native
woman, and one
Wigmore arrived
somewhere in the
vicinity of it with
a fowling-piece.
The gun, how-
ever, was not a
going concern,
and Wigmore de-
parted. Presently
he returned with
a ’303 rifle, and in
a very brief time
there was one
banana-picker less
than usual. Ac-
cording to Hos-
kings, a number
of witnesses swore
that Wigmore was
trying to shoot
fowl, and that his
eyesight or some-
thing slipped ; but
it is alleged that
these witnesses
afterwards an-
nounced to the
missions that they
had been actuated
by fear when they
made the statement,
and desired to be
given another chance
to hit Truth’s bull’s-
eye. So M.L.’s Chief Justice Stout
is going out to inquire into the
marksmanship and, incidentally,
the general administration of the
group, which Dr. Hosking describes
as a disgrace to all concerned. Another
outcome of the affair is that Dr. Rupert
Hosking (surgeon-dentist, and son of Dr. W. H.)
is suing one Grove, of Auckland, asking £lOOO as
damages for alleged slander in connection with
matters at the Islands ; and Costs looks ravenous
enough to swallow a whole crop of bananas before
it is satisfied.
Good old Magna
Charta seems to have
been torn up, or mis-
laid, or something—at
all events, that portion
of it in which it is stated
that Rex will not delay
to any man justice or
right. It was stated in a
Sydney police court the
other day that, unless a
man committed for trial
was able to obtain bail,
he was in for three
months’ gaol certain;
and a Judge told another
man who came before
him that he had served
more time in gaol before
his trial than he would
have received for his
offence. The sort of
justice that sits so
heavily on the man with-
out money or friends with money badly needs
attention.
“Jack Jay”: Ifc having been thrown at
the Maori that his courage is only negotiable
when it has been heated up to boiling point, I
propose to produce the ice-cold article and ask
White Brother if he can better it. At Port
Waikato (M.L.) recently two native girls, while
fishing in the river from a canoe, were carried
over the bar, in the sight of their two brothers,
aged 14 l5, who were returning from school.
Knowing exactly what awaited them, these
youngsters hastily scribbled on their slates,
“ Good-bye all,” and ran their own little canoe
into the river and out to the rescue. With the
utmost skill they managed to reach the ocher
canoe, but by then it was within the sweep of
the breakers, and on that bit of coast the breakers
have the last word. One girl was pulled out of
the wash by a pakeha, but the two lads and the
other sister were drowned. Now, what about it ?

Some queer discoveries are made at the
taking of a census, but nothing so far has been
brought to light like that unearthed by a Maori-
land official recently. He was gathering census
returns in the Wairoa country when he tumbled
into a large declivity and barked his shins on an
old tin box. Near by were the remains of what
had once been a blanket, women’s clothing, a
tent, and a small child’s boot. The census man
then grabbed an old tent-peg and commenced to
make further inquiries. By degrees he ascer-
tained that there was a total skeleton population
of seven on the premises—two men, two women
and three children. There was jnothing to show
who had been the original ownersof the skeletons
or when, how and why they had been left there,
so the census man handed in a return at the
nearest police station—“seven unknown, dead,”
and moved on in pursuit of the living,

APOLOGY.
I HEREBY APOLOGISE to Mr. for
assaulting him at a Dance in Hopetoun on 17th
March inst., and I sincerely regret my public exhibi-
tion of unwarranted and disgraceful conduct on the
occasion.
To all others who were present I also tender my
expressions of regret for the occurrence.
I will pay the costs of Mr. ’s solicitor in the
matter.
Dated this 27th day of March, 1911.

If that doesn’t satisfy William he’s a hard man to
please.
Melbourne Herald indulges in airy humor
at times, as when lately it headed the report of
the finding of a baby’s body in the Yarra : “Is it
murder?” The infant was but a day or so old,
and was discovered inside a bag along with three
large stones. No doubt it may have been suicide.

The Sydney police, who moved-on several
speakers during the Referenda campaign, have
now done the logical thing by moving on Salv-
army campaigners. The Salvationist, in addition
to being even less musical than J. 0. L. Fitz-
patrick, holds up more traffic in a month than the
politician does in five years. The police having
thus turned their belated attention to keeping the
streets clear, a fine, large field of effort opens before
them. The raffish, insanitary-looking youths who
jeer at and otherwise humiliate the passing female;
the Lais-like “buttoner” who lurks outside the
clothing store; the musicians who howl outside
bars ; the street cheap-jack—if the City Council,
by means of one comprehensive by-law, can wipe
out all these curses, W. M. Hughes will not have
been fined in vain.

Colored Brother had a few moments of
unusual candor at the local court at Port Pirie
(S.A.) a few days ago :
Ottam Singh (in the witness box): Every Indian man
tells lies. I tell lies. Everybody tells lies.
Counsel : Like you are teiling now?
Singh : Yes, mister I You tell lies sometime, mister.
No good telling truth all the time.
Counsel: Do you believe in God ?
B. Smith’s brother : Yes.
Opunsel: Well, what do you think will happen to you
if you tell lies?
Brother : I get pocket full of money.
BEFORE AND AFTER.
MISS CHURCHALOTT ( enthusiastically): “We
sang ‘Awake, Ye Saints ’ immediately be-
fore the service .”
MISS CASUAL : “ Wouldn't it have been more
appropriate to have sung it after the
service? ”
A SONG OF DIRT AND HEALTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sir Almroth Wright, M.D., declares that dirt forms a
protective armor round the body like the tiles of a house,
and that cleanliness cannot be defended on hygienic
grounds.
Vain is the bath, all water vain,
In dirt is all our hope ;
No bard shall rise to sing again
The victory of soap.
The scornful microbes of the air
Henceforth shall stop outside,
While strength and beauty join to wear
A mud-protected hide.
Through grime the maiden’s cheek shall blush.
The dirt of many hours
The lover to his heart shall crush
Beneath the bridal flowers.
At Manly none shall shoot the foam,
Or climb the mounting wave ;
But everyone shall sit at home,
His cuticle to save.
And where the mighty Cotter drips
Its solemn tears and slow,
The cook with murky finger-tips
Shall mix with mud her dough.
In Yassberra shall be no pain
Of wetness marred with soap,
No dream of tubs shall there restrain
An unwashed nation’s hope ;
But dusty dr3‘ the wind shall sweep
Through all the suns that shine,
VVhile mingled health and dirt shall keep
A crust like ancient wine.
And grimy sweet the days shall flow,
And murky fair the hours.
While generations come and go
Between the passing showers !
N.S.W.

RACE DECADENCE.
The sweeping indictment in the article
by ex-President Roosevelt on ** Race
Decadence” has awakened a new in.
terest in a problem which has been
agitating the older countries of the
world for some years past.
“It Is to be regretted that so many,*
before and after marriage, apparently
live only for ‘society.’ The worldly
butterfly causes children and the care
of children to be regarded
as encumbrances. A most
fatal view.”

“Ah”: There is a growing need for an up-
to-date slarig 'dictiohary. Recently some of the
“lads” froth Sydney town, who Were grafting at the
woolshed, asked the boss to bring, some “snout” from
town. When he returned with a pig’s head you could
have cooked it on the language.

“W. J.P.” : If Tiie Bulletin lias a Bakery
Editor, I hereby order a cake for presentation to the
eastern bank of . the • Mitta* River for possessing the
largest herd of black snakes to the acre in Victoria.
1 counted 11 on a 23-mile stretch of road between
Noorongong and Mitta Junction. They averaged
about sft. 9in., and one went 7ft. 2in. Better for-
ward the cake before the snake experts of Brighton
or Redfern try to intercept it.
“Puketapu”: Amongst my people it is
firmly believed that the Maoriland bush is haunted
by the ghosts of the bushmen who have been killed
by the falling- trees; and, because I have seen one
of these restless ones with my own eyes, I believe
there are others. With Totara Joe I -had taken
'o\er a clearing contract near Lake Rotoiti, in the
north, and for several nights we were puzzled by
the steady thug, thug of an axe being used some-
where in the pitch-like darkness. Curiosity over-
comes all fear in time, and one night we took a
lantern and all the courageWe could muster—which
wasn’t much —and started out' to interview the Mys-
terious Bushwhacker. Following the sound of his
axe through the heavy scrub, we 1 reached the poinj
of a ridge overlooking a small cleared space, out of
which a great rata towered into the night. At the
foot of the tree stood a man stripped to the waist,
and surrounded by a sickly white light. As he
swung backwards and forwards with the throw of the
axe, the dull thud of the blow struck melancholy
upon the dead stillness of the bush, yet the blade
made no impression on the trunk of the giant'. Sud-
denly he threw the axe down and turned towards
us as if to spring forward. And then the horror
of what we saw sent the pair of us flying in a mad
panic for the hut. The ghostly man’s brains were
running over his face. When the broad sunlight
was streaming in the bush, we went back to the little
clearing, and there under the great dead limb of «a
tree we found the skeleton of a man with the skull
crushed to splinters. We buried* him beside the
rata, and though we often listened nervously for the
Night Axe we never heard it again.
From an Australian at Los Angeles, in
California:— ■;>
The first thing that hits the- Australian in the eye
is the universal motor-car; sit also- hits him else-
where if he doesn’t look two ways at once. Like
the telephone, everybody has one, whether he can af-
ford it or not. The Pacific Slope is motor-mad.
Hundreds of homes have been mortgaged to get into
the swim.
The growth of Los Angeles compels the admiration
even of its enemies. In 10 years it has added
200,000 people to its population, and they talk of a
million in 20 years more. It is built on tourists’
money and the orange trade. Last year’s orange
crop sold for 48 millions of dollars; this year the
estimates are that 600,000 tons of oranges will be
despatched. The fruit is grown on land that would
be called a desert in Australia; but the trees are
cared for as though each orchard were a plantation of
rare roses. Tourists are coming into the place out
of the frozen North at the, rate of 1000 a (iny. A
large percentage stay here and buy homes.
The direct cause of the great .orange trade was/
the refrigerating car. There are thousands of. them"
running, each capable of carrying 6(f,0001b. Some
carry 100,0001 b. N. S. Wales , struggles, along with
20 or 30 cars, and Ma’s Railway Department can’t
see the necessity of any more!
You feel inclined to take off your hat to a city
government which provides ice-water fountains in the
public street for the ordinary foot passenger, as they
do here. You need not use the glasses provided, for
sanitary paper cups, which all school children have
to carry, can be bought for a cent apiece. They
fold up and occupy a very small space in a pocket.
The good points of the place strike one at once. It
has its bad points, which; are horrid, but for its re-
gard for public health I feel charitable towards it at
present.
“H.E.It.” : Queensland storm-birds are not
in my beat, but the little . black ant of the Nor’-
Western rivers is an infallible rain-announcer and
when you see him make ah ant-line for the nearest
tree, you’d best get on the side of a river with a
station or a hill on it. The Nor’-Western insect
swears by last year’s flood, and climbs no higher than
its debris in the tree-forks, where it puts up its
umbrella and waits for the clouds to roll by.
A THANKFUL HEART.
LOO: "I see there's bin a big fire in Brewarrina—McCreddie's, the chemist's , Brownrigg's,
I saddlers , and Saunders's new store —all destroyed
OLD: " Thank ’Eavens! No pub burnt!"
“Geofred”: After all, what is to really
constitute the sheep-shearing champion ? I rather
agree with “Pick” (B. 4/5/’ll) when he asserts
that Zimmerle’s reign as top dog is likely to be
short. I know, and have worked next to, many men
who can walk all round Zimmerle’s record. I have
seen Jimmy Gibbs and Larry Dryden cut over 150
Milo wethers —sheep that are not all smootlx-woolled,
but covered in wrmkles —and they have maintained
this speed for days. But I don’t reckon that anyone
is going to be; ass enough to call a man champion
simply because he can turn out the greatest number
of sheep in a run of five minutes, or of two hours,
Or even of eight hours. For instance, Ted Dean, of
New England district (Ma State), cut, at Alice-
Downs (Q.), in ’O7 or ’OB, over 1100 sheep in
five days of eight hours 40 minutes each and a
Saturday of four hours 40 minutes; and there were
other men in the shed who averaged over 150 for the
Six days. But the Whittinghams (owners of Alice
Downs) were well known to be “easy-to-please”
bosses, and certainly some of the sheep passed out as
shorn were not—well, as neat as they might have
been, to put it gently. I was tar-boy at Alice, and
I know, Therefore I claim that (although I know
Zimmerle and Dean, and would back Dean to win
in a pure endurance butchering test) Dean, Zim-
merle and many another big gun I could name have
no right to the title of champion. On the other
hand, let Dean, Zimmerle, Livingstone, Dryden and
(say) Sam 1 Wilson loose in a shed of the toughest
Wrinkled merinos possible to find, appoint competent
judges, and I’ll bet my hat that Sammy Wilson, old
man that he is, with an average of 140 sheep per
day, clean 'arid beautifully shorn, would receive a
belt that the fast dare-devil brigade are not, and
never have beta, entitled to. I have seen Wilson
day after day go through 140 or 150 tough “wrink-
lies,” and at the.-end of each day there was not
enough “cut” or “ruffle” on any of his sheep to
arouse the curiosity of the most voracious blowfly.
But what about the 200-odd sheep turned out day
after day in the same shed by the guns? Some-
times I' have seen them butchered enough to attract
all the flies of the Australian Commonwealth.
The man who gets my vote is the man who can,
day after day, go steadily and cleanly through a
flock of 20,000, and maintain his average to the
end—not to the daredevil who tears the wool off the
backs of some 300 sheep in one day, and next day
stays in bed to recover.

“Wang”: The champion tobacco cadger
I ever knew was an old cove named Rogers, and he
made a specialty in youthful smokers proud in the
possession of a cake of weed and a new pipe. 1 was
one at the time. He'd line up and say, “That’s ——
good-lookin’ tobacco you’re smokin’; lend’s a pipe-
ful.” And a pipeful generally meant half the plug.
Finally I got tired of it, and one day, when I saw
him coming, I put the pipe into my pocket. “Got
any tobacco?” he queried, knocking his pipe against
a post. “No,” I told him ; “I’ve given up smok-
ing.” “ATi! That’s a pity,” he answered. “I was just
goin’ t’ pay yer back th’ terbaccer I’ve borrored off
yer.” Next time I met him. I was puffing away as
usual. “What!” he exclaimed. “Thought yer’d
given it up.” “Couldn’t do without it,” I replied.
“Thought not,” he said, “give’s a fill.”
“Sapphira Smith”: “Owing to the recent
fatal bathing accident through a jellyfish at Can-
non Valley, Proserpine (Q.)> the Shire Clerk an-
nounces that until further notice bathing in the
sea at Cannon Valley Beach is prohibited.” To the
eyes of those only moderately familiar with the
habits of the gentle jellyfish, that recent Northern
announcement must look strange. As regular fre-
quenters of the surf are aware, the placid medusa
is not given to leaping swiftly upon the happy pic-
nicker and burying its fangs in his innards. As a
matter of fact, it is a cousin of this familiar proto-
plasm who is responsible for the prohibition order.
Everywhere this relative is known as the “Portu-
guese man-o’-war.” In the Proserpine case men-
tioned in the notice, a youngster was bathing (it
happened a few weeks ago), when one of these
things came into contact with him, and he was
dead in an hour’s time. At the beginning of the
year a parallel case was recorded in the same
locality. The first victim was a lad of about 16.
Now, I have known individuals to be stung by a
Portugee, and beyond the use of some very violent
language and expressive squirmings, there were no
lamentable results. Is this thing, then, more dan-
gerous at some times than at others, or is its vio-
lence accounted ‘for by the locality in which it
is found ?
* * * *
“E.H.11.”: Concerning those pigs of “Mar-
loo’s” that cut their throats in an endeavor to swim
the Richmond River (N.S.W.) ; what sort of porkers
were they, anyhow ? Isn’t it nearly time that old
fallacy was pensioned? If “Marloo” ever saw a
pig slaughtered, he should know that the veins are
very deep, and the knife is inserted in the opposite
direction to that which a pig would strike when
swimming. Even if “Marloo’s” pigs had toe-nails as
sharp as wire-nails they could not reach the veins
—provided “Marloo” hasn’t invented a new kind of
Pig-
* * * *
“Walkabout”: Nothing in the shape of
food comes amiss to the inland niggers of W.A.
Around the edge of the lakes, frogs of a sickly
greenish-yellow color are to be found in thousands,
and are eagerly collected by black brother. Just as
the slimy entree is extracted from its mud-hole it
is thrown on the fire and eaten in a generally half-
cooked state. The nig. looks upon it as a “big
phella bundy” (good) feed—a point and a-half be-
hind “bardie” and “bungarra,” and 2A points better
than snake.
“Climax”: “Yalgun” (B. 30/3/’ll) in-
quires re the early demise of the half-caste abori-
ginal. If he had carried his observations a bit
further and taken note of the whole-caste as well,
he’d have found that very few of them reach the age-
limit, either. In Bananaland, anyway, there are as
many deaths from pulmonary disease among full-
castes as among half-castes, so the white streak can-
rtbt be the cause. Another point about the yellow man
is his marked deterioration after marriage. After six
months he is not so good as he was; at the end of
12 months he is hopelessly and incurably useless, and
at the end of the second year he would be a positive
nuisance but for the fact that he is also generally
dead. F
RENT-DAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I wake with aching brow and throbbing vein ;
A sense of hopeless gloom broods over all;
An all-night blowfly clambers up the pane ;
A daddy-long-legs ambles down the wall.
Bile-colored rays stream in through window-hatch,
Enmix’d with stagnant fog-envenom’d air;
And hark ! my strained expectant ears can catch
His fateful footsteps creeping up the stair!
A knock. I cower low, as one who snores,
Yet hold my breath. A knock. I still lie pat.
A knock.-More knocks. Then angry knocks in scores
That rouse the trembling tenants of the flat!
And then. ~a long, long silence. Hath he done?
I patter, doorwards, and—ye gods!—l spy
His ginger whiskers, fiery as the sun,
Rising above the fanlight-glass on high!
The game,'is up. No further call for tact.
I roar in answer tp his whispered beck :
“This afternoon, at four-fifteen exact,
I’ll pay, you at your office.. .with a cheque,
“Or, post.. it,, if you like...” The Viper speaks:
“H’rn, something on account...” .“.4b-surd !” I
shout.
“But, ’ere...” “I haven’t got the cash!” “Three
weeks...”
“Go to the Devil...” “Will you pay...” “Clear
out!”
“I’ll give you half an hour...” “I’ll give you Rats
If you don’t quit 1” “I’ll get the Johns as well. .”
“Well, get them!” “Bailiffs...” “Get them!”
“Seize yer mats
An’ furnichoor !... ” “You can’t!” .“Can!...
“Go to 11—11!”
So rolls the Argument about the place,
Until at length, its very bones picked bare,
With one last threat the ginger-whiskered face
Sinks like a harvest-moon below the stair.
I crawl back, cursing, to my cot again,
And watch, through black Dejection’s mothy pall,
The same old blowfly toddle up the pane,
The same old spider dodder down the wall.

“Yarrum” : In the good old days at
Araluen (N.S.W.), before proper roads were formed,
and when there was a population of eight or ten
thousand miners and dependents, store goods that
couldn’t be carted into the valley were slid down
from a fifteen hundred feet eminence. Packed on
horseback from Nelligen, 30 miles away, they were
run out upon a rocky platform and toppled over.
Then the diggers down below would turn out in a
body, and endeavor, with long poles and other
weapons, to stop the rush before the things got into
the quicksand of the creek. Once a pole got through
a keg of butter, which burst, and reached the creek
in greasy fragments. To this day that creek—an
arm of the Dena River, at the mouth of which
Moruya stands—has been known as Dirty Butter
Creek. Once a case of musical instruments was
rolled over. A harp escaped, and a high wind car-
ried it into the upper limbs of a gigantic gum-tree,
where the twigs and zephyrs whipped weird music
out of the thing for months. Last time I was in
the valley the tree stood ring-barked and lonesome,
and only the rusted and rotting harp-frame remained
on high. Nowadays, when only a few Chows cling
to the old goldfield, the roads into it are some of
the best in Australia.

“Eddyson”; At Blind Rise, Gippsland,
there’s a diverting battle going on between a man
and a mountain. As might be expected, it looks
as if the mountain will register a complete knock-out
one of these fine nights. Callow was simple enough
to build his house right under Blind Rise. True, he
is about half a mile from the base, but, all the
same, his domicile is within easy stone’s-throw, *ee-
ing that Blind Rise can throw half a ton of granite
a mile or so without putting forth undue
exertion. The preci-
pitate ridge is pep-
pered with boulders
like a duff with
plums, and up near
the roof hefty peb-
bles as big as a dray
are continually being
liberated by climatic
influences and general
wear and tear. The
conformation of Blind
R i s e’s “confounded
base” is *uch that all
rock* dislodged along
about a thousand
yards of the ridge-
front are directed into
a sort of natural shoot
as thej' come bound-
in g down, and are
shot straight at Cal-
low’s castle. The
house had not been
built a month when
Blind Rise took a pot
shot at it, and knock-
e d the chimney all
over 10 acres. Later,
a boulder hit the kit-
chen corner, and
knocked a hole in it
large enough to ad-
mit a cow. When the
third boulder dropped
in and devastated the
virtuous couch, Mrs.
Callow took up her be-
longings and her
baby, and went home
to mother. But Cal-
low had got his back
up, and Callow’s a
sticker. He stands by
the house, or by the
little that’s left of it,
and is maintaining a
Litter feud with Blind Rise. It seems fatuous to
conduct arguments with a mountain, especially a
mountain that hurls rocks as big as balloons, but
Callow goes on asserting his rights, even though his
house and home looks as if it had been used for
target practice. My informant tells me that he rode
14 miles to have a look at Callow and his per-
forated villa, and just as lie and his guide arrived
a stone like a hurtling pig-pen skipped over the
roof, and shattered a gum 200.vds. away, and a wild
man in his-shirt and a rick of dishevelled whiskers
rushed out, shook two red fists at the mountain, and
yelled: “Missed, you cow! Missed!”

“Tattered Sprat” : Shot a strange bird the
other day. Close inspection proved it to be a
parrot, of the common or orchard variety of rosella ;
but instead of sporting the. usual harem skirt of
green and yellow, this particular fowl was robed in
feathers of cream and white. Evidently albinos fly
in all shapes.
The Hon. the Editor, Dear Sir, — I think
it is time you obtained a quantity of beer (I
only suggest this because it seems a fundamental
element in all artistic and literary ceremonials in
Australia), and then devoted a day to the classifi-
cation and renaming, of .your staff of contributors.
There is a sad lack of originality in the assortment
of pen names. Take, as •jm instance, that poor
person whom one naturally pictures as a dusty, di-
lapidated, wiry-whiskered swagman, or tramp, or
whaler, or whatever they are called in Australia—
I mean “Jimmie Pannikin.” What follows? “A.
Wiiliam-Chnn,” of course; and if “Billy Cann”
hasn’t already turned up at the office—well, it’s only
a matter of time. (Please don’t read any base in-
sinuation in my last sentence.) Then, there’s
“Henry Horsecollar,” immediately dogged by a
“Henry Horsebreaker.” Also, a small, excitable per-
son, “Horatio Breathless,” was straightway pursued
by one “Horatio Thirsty.” The fear of endangering
Austra —, I mean Sydney’s—diplomatic relations
with Europe restrains me from speaking of those
foreign notabilities, “Alphonse Parbleu” and “Henri
Singemoine.” But I have my doubts about “Alger-
non 0. ITogsinge,” To me .it sounds superficial and
somewhat forced; I think he’s a Yank. Neither dare
I criticise that classical character, “Petronius Ear-
biter.” But before Re-naming Day eventuates, I
would suggest an Originality Competition. Those I
predict would remain in the final heat, are—“ Co-
rporal Bung,” “Kodak,” “Horatio Breathless,” “Phil-
ander Flam,” “Drunk-as-a-Cow,” “B. R. Chewer,”
“Stony,” “Isaac Gumboil, J.P.,” “Curse o’ Moses,”
“Jimmie Pannikin,” “Henry Horsecollar,” “The Re-
ligious Editor” and “Augustus Blowfly.” Probably
the last unwittingly decoyed “Barnabas Buzz” and
“Bluebottle” into, the scene. Now could one pos-
sibly find a more shocking display of disreputable
identities than revealed above 1 Positively, no ! On
the other hand, there are some names that affect me
greatly. I almost weep as I write them. Poor old
“Stony”; poor old “Dunno.” There’s a heavy,
mournful sound about them. “Amongst those also
present,” I might mention “Mary McCommonwealth,”
closely attended by an irrepressible stranger, “Gwen-
doline O’Gracious.” And now, as an example of
more refined and cultivated taste in the science of
nomenclature,. I sign myself, graciously your*,

“Condoi”: Talking about carpet snakes, I
caught one the other day getting outside a ’possum.
Brought him to camp as he was, and watched de-
velopments. Snake was in no hurry, and after about
an hour had only head and. part of shoulders down.
Mixed some mustard and applied it to ’possum.
Result, a hurriedly discarded meal, and the most
infuriated snake in six States. I had to stop the
language with an axe.
“Kodak” : I was humping bluey along a
road just outside the suburban radius when 1 noticed
an unusual sort of swagman standing at the door of
a dilapidated hut and gazing reflectively towards the
Sunset Side. The vagrant was a stout man of about
50, who, in spite of his ragged clothes, had an air
of authority. Perched absurdly on the back of his
immense bald head was a battered bell-
topper, and he majestically stroked his flow-
ing beard with a plump hand which had
obviously never done any hard work. His
nose was painted with variegated drinks. As I ap-
proached, he smiled a welcome, and waved his hand
gracefully. “Good evening, sir,” he boomed. “May
I ask you if you have any flour to spare ? My man has
foolishly forgotten to lay in a supply.” He bowed
me into the abandoned hut with the air of a lord-
in-waiting. I sat down on a lump of wood and he
took a large flat stone. “Pannikin 1” he roared.
Something short of wind and flat of foot fled round
the hut from the back. “Yessir,” it mumbled as it
ran. “Was you calling, sir?” I looked round in
time to witness the stumbling entry of the abject
stage butler with dress-suit and duster all complete.
“Tw’O whiskies and soda, d ~n you! roared the
vagrant, whom I now recognised as A. William-Cann,
late of'Oxford. “Yessir!” blurted the unfortunate
Pannikin with a clumsy bow. It was evident he
had just been hanging over a hot fire. His grimy
brow was bedewed with perspiration. As he turned
away to execute the drink order the poor wretch
half-uneonsciously mopped his shining face with his
filthy dishclout or whatever it was. Instantly his
employer jumped up, and, uttering a malediction,
administered a sound kick. Pannikin, without a
word scrambled up from the dust and scuttled out.
Evidently the faithful thing was used to it. A.
William-Cann resumed his seat and apologised for
his man’s lack of manners, explaining that he would
have turned him adrift long ago but for the fact that
he was so old a retainer. The honest serving-man
shortly afterwards sidled in with two of his name-
sakes half full of water and a bottle containing a
quantity of rum. “I call it whisky and soda,” ex-
plained William-Cann airily; “it tastes better that
way.” As he raised his. mug of vile drink, he
notice his faithful fellow making a pathetic attempt
to smile. “Don’t stand gibbering at me!” he bel-
lowed- “See to the dinner!” The unhappy soul
fell out of the place in panic haste, and William-
Cann, after explaining that he did not wish to have
me bothered by the fool, picked up my well-filled
tucker-bag and himself took it round the back. In
a minute or so he returned and started to entertain
me with reminiscences of Oxford. He spoke humor-
ously and without a trace of shame of his bygone
debaucheries, and ridiculed the unswerving dog-like
devotion of his simple-minded and spiritless
shadow Pannikin, who had left his British pantry to
follow him into exile. “Why,” laughed the heartless
ne’er-do-well, “the idiot even brought his old dress-
suit to wear at meal-times, so that I should not feel
I had broken away altogether from the old life.”
I was naturally revolted at his way of speaking,
and felt glad when Pannikin at last announced
dinner —which proved to be composed of my rations
Throughout the meal, which we ate from the side of
a battered fruit-case, Pannikin, when he wasn’t pass-
ing things, stood respectfully in the dust behind his
master’s stone seat, and kept the numerous flies at
bay with half a sheet of jam-stained newspaper,
folded so as to represent a serviette. I had' never
looked upon a more pathetic picture than that of the
faithful serving-man attending on the bald and un-
grateful ruin of a cultured English blackguard. I
was about to attack A. William-Cann on the subject
of his ill-treatment of Pannikin, when I was inter-
rupted by the ringing of an unsuspected ’phone.
Pannikin dutifully turned away to answer the call,
which gradually became louder and louder, and
eventually resolved itself into the cheap alarm which
drags me from dreams.
CONSOLATION.
BROWN (whipping the cat): “ What a perfect
ass I am! ”
THE IDIOT JONES : “ Oh, impossible, old man.
None of us are perfect, you know.”
“Ewan Mee” : Re the controversy as to
throwing-back, can any Abo. account for this ? A
mare, which for three years previously had been
mated with a donkey, was mated with a stallion,
and gave premature birth to twin foals, one being
a horse foal and the other a mule. This happened
outside Oodnadatta, and can be proved; so you need
not look so hard at me.
THE WEEKLY MAIL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s a long way out to Giggler’s, as the mail-pro-
peller knows,
When towards the scorching, thirsty West, the good
old battler goes,
His good-as-golden mailbags whirling down the
dusty track,
While wild, assorted blazes rage all up and down
Outback ;
When, blinded with the smoke, he starts his horses
on the jump,
Bang, clatter, biff and wallop, hell-’n’-whiskers,
plunge and bump—
And the sweating, striving unicorn, careering, seems
to snail,
As the bush-flames do a gallop, chasing in the weekly
mail!
It’s a long way out to Giggler’s, and a dry and parch-
ing spell,
As the bringer of the well-beloved weekly mail can
tell;
And sometimes it is longer, as upon a windy day,
When through a crimson dust-fog Bill proceeds upon
his way.
When, through the blasts cyclonic, crashing boughs
and falling gums,
Torn up, but still triumphant, Bill into the town-
ship comes,
The township grins a welcome as he rides in on the
gale,
With an angry breeze behind him, blowing in the
weekly mail.
It’s a far cry out to Giggler’s when the mailman, on
his own,
Intrepidly advances out across a sea unknown,
AVhen the creeks are roaring torrents and the tracks
are blotted out,
And the crossings have evanished through a busted
waterspout;
Still, he gets there, being lucky, with the mailbag
on his back,
Swirling right into the township, down the old, ac-
customed track,
On a moist, uneasy tree-trunk, wet without and wild
within . . .
There’s a whisky waiting for him when the weekly
mail floats in !
VICTORIA'.

THE DISTURBED: “ You get ! ”
THE DISTURBER: “ You bet!"
Captain Josiah Slocum, who sailed from
Boston (U.S. A.) all round the world many years
since in his little boat Spray, with
no crew and no companion but
a dog which he introduced to
the Sydney people as “ my first
mate,” left Boston 18 months
ago in a similar fashion, and
has not been heard of since.
So the chances are that
there will be no word of
him till theseagives up
its dead. The adven-
turous captain had
taken coal cargoes
from Newcastle
(N.S.W.) to ’Frisco
and Callao, and had
acquired among
mariners such a
tough reputation as
a “hard doer”
that when he ap-
peared in Australia
on his lonely own,
after a feat of navi-
gation unexampled
in all history, he
got but a cold re-
ception from the
men who go down
to the sea in ships.
But his troubles!
He was a typical
Uncle Sam, goatee
and all—you could
see “Old Glory”
woven on the breast of
Ilia rough flannel shirt
even if it wasn’t really
there; a lean, stalwart m"n
of iron nerve, with the
grave humor characteristic
of the typical North American ;
with a soul full of subdued
color and frozen sentiment—a
man who smiled only with his
eyes. Yet could he quite en-
trance you with his unemotionally-delivered speech
as you sat on the solitary bunk of his
little sloop, and heard the tale of how the
worn-out solitary seaman had threaded his
way among: the giant icebergs of Kerguelen
and Cape Horn, and watched the moonlight play
upon their fluted columns and cliffs of silver, and
how in the darkness, among the ice-blasts blowing
from the Pole, he had heard Cathedral chimes
upon the churchless deeps, and listened to the
sound of oars in seas where no rowers row. The
mad-doctor who heard him talk would say that he
must have had a close call, and any sailor would
reckon that, when he shaped a course and tied
down the tiller and went to sleep, a little worse
luck would then and there have sealed his doom.
As things turned out, the end was delayed for 15
years.
“ Condot ” on the “ Dickens stamp ” pro-
posal :
From the pinnacle of his greatness “Harrison O.”
(B. 11/5/’ll) should show mercy unto the irresponsible
and obscure persons whom he denounces for their
“ impudent appeal ” on behalf of the descendants of
Charles Dickens. The fact that Dickens left £70,000 or
£BO,OOO is beside the question. If he left £80,000,000 and
his descendants were in poor circumstances, an appeal to
his admirers on their behalf would be justified.
“ Harrison O.’s ” crushing: extract from Dickens’s will ask-
ing that he should not be made the subject of “any
monument, memorial, or testimonial whatsoever,” is
altogether irrelevant. The proceeds of the sale of the
stamp will go to the descendants, and Dickens will not be
the subject of a memorial or testimonial. “ Harrison O,”
should know, too, that the appeal is to admirers of
Dickens. “ Harrison O.” need not buy a stamp. If
“Harrison O.” had unfortunately died before Dickens,
probably Dickens would not have bought a “ Harrison
O.” stamp.
Seth Ferry (“ the Master”), who knows
more about racing and racing men than perhaps
any other body in Australia,, has
completed the MS. of a book of re-
miniscences, but no publisher is to
hand yet. Still, that isn’t the only
S. Australian instance of an undis-
covered publisher. R. H. Edmunds,
ex-Superintendent of the “Stock-
ade,” or chief labor prison, was with
explorer McKinley, and has a diary
of the whole exciting time. Tlmf
record, though worthy of print, is
still in MS. Beaumont Read, the
little man with the sweet voice, who
died some time ago, was writing his
reminiscences of Australian musical
people and his early experiences
when Death wrote Finis to the work.
Also, “ .Tim ”G. Dick, best known
of men-about-town, once commenced •
to write his recollections of South f
Australian citizens. He knew I so
many people and so many things
about those people that he took
them alphabetically, and after a few
years’ secret work had reached “ M.”
Then someone discovered what he
was doing, and Dick was spoken to
so earnestly that the whole carpet-
bag full was destroyed.
Pneumonia has killed E. W.' G.
Rathbone, of Auckland (M.L.),
dramatic critic of the Star. A con-
scientious worker, he had little of
the flaneur ability of his brother, A.
H. Rathbone, who founded Auck-
land Observer, and was afterwards
a lively London correspondent.
When the just-deceased Wilfrid
landed in Auckland hisultra-fashion-
able clothes and perfect London man-
ners raised the ironic admiration' of
the local pressmen to its highest
altitude; but the man himself
was trumps. For a time he was editor of the
Graphic (the Star’s Weekly), and, later, was on
the editorial staff of the daily. He was 44 when
he wrote his last criticism.

It seems that the oldest inky wayfarer in
Victoria is a woman—-Mrs. J. W. Swords, of
Dandenong, who reached her 90th birthday last
week. She and her husband arrived in Port
Phillip Bay in 1840. They went to Portland,
where the husband started the first country news-
paper in the colony—the Guardian, still issued.
Mrs. Swords aided in the preparation of the first
number, and “ pulled ” the first impression. F.
W. Swords, proprietor.of the Dandenong Herald
and president of the Victorian Country Press
Association, is a son—one of her 105 descendants.
The electorate had not yet been won for
Labor, so Smith .(call him that) reckoned the
time was ripe. When Beadle, the
owner of the station where Smith in-
tended to do some shearing, heard the
news, he refused Smith a stand in the
shed. Beadle, who had eyes on the seat
himself, thought he had dished his
man, especially when he saw him
washing his clothes in the lagoon a
few days after the shearing commenced.
Still later, when he saw Smith washing
clothes in the lagoon as if his life de-
pended upon it, he began to wonder
what sort of a wardrobe the enemy
.carried. He didn’t know that the 80
shearers had appointed Smith laundry-
man-in-general at Is. 6d. each per
week, and that every' bight all hands
were being addressed on Labor doc-
trines. Bbadle lost that election by a
large majority, and Smith hasn’t asked
him for a job since. As a matter of
fact, he doesn’t need to,-being a Minis-
ter in a Labor Government.,
Jack Davidson, the dearly be-
loved of Melbourne inky-wayfarers, who
has been acting as editor of the local
Herald while Colonel Reay has been
careering over the earth, has been nailed
to the chair, and the Colonel goes' to
what he calls the Heart of the Empire.
Davidson is Yankee by birth and Aus-
tralian by everything else. He has
been a good many things in his time,
even for a while assisting Matilda
across the landscape. Originally on
the West Australian, he left that
sepulchre to join the Melbourne
AjEtGfUS, thence was lured to the
Hfiiald. The. ’Euald has also secured
Jack Nish, formerly chief sub editor of the
Argus, who will track the elusive bloodstain as
news editor.

The other night Gov. Islington, of M.L.,

rified surprise by attending the Northern Boxing

Doctors’ bills paid by the Vic. Railway
Department after the Richmond smash : Henry
O’Hara, .£1894; R. A. Stirling, £999; R. C.
Brown, £949: R. G. Reid, £688; E. Joske,
£079; R. Aitchison, £606; E. J. Keogh, £684;
E. B. Allan, £563; and a swarm of ’em between
<£soo and £3OO. Dr. O’Hara, who beat the second
runner by 98 lengths, is a practitioner who
never loses his dash in these events. Little Billy
Maloney, M.H.R., was among the also rans. His
was a very modest £73 10s.
From J. D. Fitzgerald (who, by the way,
is a brother-in-law of Henry Fielding Dickens,
K.C.): —
A word in reply to “Harrison 0.,” who protests
against what he calls “ the impudent appeal made by
the perpetrators of the Dickens testimonial.” The
“testimonial,” in the form of a Dickens stamp, is, in
essence, an attempt to do justice to the Dickens
descendants by restoring copyright profits on the sale of
the great novelist’s work. The publishers no longer pay
copyright, and if the public cares to extend copyright
profits voluntarily, in the interests of some members of
the Dickens family who are not in good circumstances,
no literary man ought to step forward as a devil’s advo-
cate to prevent it. Without raising the extremely in-
teresting question of the right of a literary man’s
descendants to stand in as good a position as the man
who inherits land, nor the question of the duration Of
copyright, I do say that if a reader Who loves Dickens
wishes to pay off his debt to the great author, he should
be free to do that by directing some of the profit into
the pockets of others beside the publisher and bookseller.
Of ihe children of the great novelist, Henry Fielding
Dickens, K.C., is the only one who has amassed wealth.
(I might, in passing, resent the sneer of a recent writer to
the effect that anything said or done in connection with
this stamp movement will either pecuniary benefit or
“ advertise ” Henry Dickens. As one of the highest fee’d
leaders of the English Bar, he needs no advertisement.
His connection with the Dickens Fellowship is evidence
of his loyalty to bis father's memory, and he is the best
reader of his father’s works since Charles Clarke died.) 1
understand that the pecuniary results of the stamp will
go, riot to the first generation of Dickenses, but to the
children of the eldest son, Charles Dickens, who are not
in the most affluent circumstances. As a lifelong lover
and a constant reader of .Dickens, I intend to have the
“ testimonial ’’ stamp in my copies of his works ; and if I
know that, by linking myself with millions throughout
the World in a fellowship of gratitude to the great
humanitarian writer (who did more to arouse the con-
science of the rich in their treatment of the poor than
any other Englishman) Igm also assisting his impover-
ished descendants, I will not be annoyed by that fact.
A HEARTFELT PRAYER.
Considerable disgust has been excited in the public
mind in Melbourne by the allegations made before
the Board of Public Health that bread obtained from
two different suburban bakeries contained in one in-
stance a stump of a cigar, and in another a portion
of a- cigarette, which had evidently fallen from the
bakers’ mouths into the dough.
“ Give its this day our daily bread—and kindly
put some smokes in it .”
Education Minister Coneybeer (S. A.), who
for over a year has been hanging round death’s
door, suffering from a complication of complaints,
including gastric and typhoid fever, has at last
got back to work again.
Tom Glass, M.L.A. for Bendigo East,
about the biggest and strongest-looking man in
the Vic. Assembly, died in the Melbourne hospi-
tal on May 17, after an illness that dragged out
for 12 months. Tom’s complaint puzzled the
doctors of Bendigo and Melbourne, and a series
of operations didn’t clear up the mystery.
Finally, after he had lost, the sight of both eyes,
he was taken to the Melbourne hospital, where
Dr. F. Bird operated for tumor of the brain. It
was a completely successful operation —except
that, having no strength, the patient died. Like
Alec P.eacock, Tom Glass started out in life as a
grocer’s assistant, and also did most of his climb-
ing on the back of the A.N.A. He was a good
democrat and a good Australian, and Death
showed poor discrimination when it took him.
SOME OLD THINGS ARE BEST AFTER ALL.
There have been many advances in medicine, many
new and valuable discoveries, but nothing in the line

Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy for giving quick and

known curative agents, and there is no experimenting
when we recommend you to try this old and reliable
remedy.*

This is one of the four Australian banks whose heads
are in London, where most of the shares are regis-
tered. Banks with Boards in Australia have in re-
cent years steadily declined to put up their div. be-
yond 10 p.c. ; if they have had a surplus profit be-
yond 10 p.c. to divide, they have preferred to issue
fresh capital, and give shareholders an extra plum
that way. British Boards apparently don’t see that
divs. beyond 10 p.e. may attract unwelcome atten-
tion ; hence this co., like the Union, has cheerfully
sailed up far past that line, and they may wonder
some day whether discretion isn’t the better part of
valor.
The ’Asia’s position is extraordinarily strong,
though nominally there has been jio wonderful in-
crease in the business in recent years. This brings
the principal figures together:—
Liabilities.
Oct., 1900. Oct., 1910.
Deposits .. ..£13,650,832 £16,896,476
Other liabilities . 3,201,350 3,388,251
Assets. .
Liquid assets .. .. 6,734,363 8,952,671
Advames .. .. 13,325,668 14,755,338
Premises .. .. 411,193 130,443
Advances have thus increased only from £13,325,668
to £14,765,338. Yet profits are now £198,531,
whereas 10 years ago they were only £151,466 —
and that was much above the average of those days.
It is quite clear that the assets to-day are a much
more profitable lot than they were some years back,
it seems highly probable also that assets which had
been written down have been sold during the recent
good time at a considerable advance on written down
values. For some years the directors were in the
habit of acknowledging such recoveries, but nowa-
days they appear to take them as a matter of course.
Out of the disclosed profits large additions have been
made to visible reserves; and there is no doubt what-
ever that there are also very large reserves that don’t
show above the surface. From the comparison made
just now, it will be seen that the book-value of pre-
mises has been reduced from £411,193 to £130,443
in 10 years. This means that the bank has paid for
all its large additions to premises out of profits, and,
moreover, has written £280,750 off the old premises.
The difference between the £130,443 and the
£750,000 or so which the premises are probably
worth, is an internal reserve. And if the bank adopts
a policy of hard writing down with regard to the
premises asset, it is reasonable to conclude that a
very prudent policy is adopted with regard to the
business in general.
Naturally, having a large internal reserve, which
is productive, the earnings calculated on capital and
visible reserves combined climb to the top rungs of
the ladder:—
Apl., 1907 .. £l5 10 10 p.c. Apl., 1909 .. £lO 15 10 p.c.
Oct., 1907 .. 12 9 6 ~ Oct., 1909.. 10 16 9 ~
Apl., 1998 .. 13 410 „ Ap1.,1910.. 1112 10 „
Oct., 1908 .. 11 16 9 ~ Oct., 1910.. 1115 3 „
In proportion to capital and reserves the bank hasn’t
got any very large swag of public money to make
use of —under £6 of the public’s for every £1 of
its own. Further, even of the public money which
it has got, no less than 44 p.c. is in liquid assets.
These figures indicate an exceedingly strong posi-
tion ; they suggest either that the business is extra-
ordinarily profitable or that the co.’s own assets are
(as already pointed out) of far greater value than
the accounts lay claim to.
There have been few changes of much interest
during the 12 months: —
Oct., 1909. Oct., 1910.

Bills, etc. ... 2,287,380 2,823,365 Inc. 535,985

Advances .. 14,506,564 14,755,338 Dec. 51,226
Premises .. 168,083 130,443 Dec. 37,640
In the matter of advances the ’Asia is evidently going
slow. It is in a position to pick and choose, and
evidently it is doing it. A slump in Australian pros-
perity and securities should, therefore, find it very
little affected.

Five or six years ago this paper had serious doubts
about the London Bank of Australia. It seemed to
be taking too optimistic a view of the future. Things
have, however, turned out all right; and by this
time the bank should have made itself safe and snug.
If things hadn’t turned out all right—-well, some-
thing serious might have happened. The manage-
ment was really in a very awkward position. It
had undertaken to pay no less than 44 p.c. on its
old locked-up deposits—a very heavy load indeed,
when you remember that more or less of those de-
posits were unrepresented by profitable securities.
However, fortune favored the brave—we’ll call it the
brave, anyhow. Not only has there been a pretty
fair demand for money., but Australian assets have
nearly all moved up rapidly in value; and the latter
has been of incalculable value to a concern like this,
which had a lot of old assets to realise and old debts
to liquidate. This shows the progress that has been
made in getting rid of the old skeleton in the cup-
board :

1910 .. 608,444 317,162 30,902
Most of the other banks got rid of a good deal of
their liability by converting it into pref. capital.
The London, offering 44 p.c. interest on locked-up
deposits, held out very little inducement to de-
positors to convert; so that when it offered to take.
£1,500,000 of pref. capital, it got only £171,930.
The deposit receipt-holders are no doubt sorry now,
because the pref. capital gets a 7 p.c. dividend.
This division is, however, made under special con-
ditions. The pref. shares are entitled to a first 54
p.c. (after depositors are paid their interest, of
course) ; then the ordinaries are entitled to 5 p.c. ;
then the prefs. are entitled to half the surplus in
order to bring their 54 p.c. up to 7 p.c. But, after
getting 7 p.c. for five years, the prefs.’ preference as
to div. ceases entirely, though they are still en-
titled to first cut in the event of liquidation. There
remains now £608,444 of the old debt to pay off,
and there is no need to shift that until 1917. The
latter, of course, is a handy provision in case things
should suddenly go wrong with Australia; though,
since the money still carries 44 p.c., it will no doubt
be got rid of before the due date, provided money
keeps plentiful in Australia. So long as there is a
large amount of this 44 p.c. money owing, profits
are bound to be irregular. If, for instance, an
average of 1 p.c. more can be made on this money
in one year than in another, it means a difference
of over £6OOO in the year’s profit. With ordinary
deposits the rate -of interest shrinks if the average
rate for loans shrinks; but with this debt the in-
terest sticks at 44 p.c., whether the average over-
draft rate is 44 p.c. or 8 p.c, An arrangement of the
fixed sort is all right with money in demand; when
it isn’t in demand, then somebody else has to go
short in order to feed the mortgagee. So the man-
agement will no doubt have a comfortable feeling
when it shakes hands with the last of this debt, and
secs it out on to the door-mat. And then the man-
agement will probably tap it on the shoulder and
remark affably that there is room for it inside on a
3 or 34 p.c. basis, as an ordinary deposit.
Whether the London has got back the old deposit
money or not, it has got some money in considerable
quantities. Ten years ago its deposits (new) totalled
£2,652,827; they now reach £4,301,477. Here is
a comparison covering that and other items:—
_, ' . 1900. 1910,
New Deposits £2,652,827 £4,301,477
Old Deposits 1,911,964 608,444

Advances 4,327.294 3,943,855
Premises .381,700 385,904
Advances have thus actually shrunk. That means
that a great many old securities have been realised,
while no doubt a considerable amount of new busi-
ness has been got. So the figures don’t really show
the improvement that may have taken place, and no
doubt has taken place. For some years, before the
public felt quite sure of the position, the deposits
didn t roll in; recently the figures have moved along
fast:—
1909. 1910.

Advances .. .. 3,653,713 3,943,855 Inc. 290,142
Premises .. .. 384,959 385,904 Inc. 945
'•’he tota l liabilities (excluding deposits due in
1917) are £5,311,425 ; and liquid assets represent
43 p.c. of that amount. Including the old deposits
the proportion is 38 p.c. These reserves appear to
be quite strong enough for all ordinary purposes. In
one respect, however, the bank could still do with
some strengthening. Even apart from the old de-
posits, the liabilities, as mentioned just now, total
£5,311,425 ; and that is equal to £8 2s. 6d. for
every £1 of share capital and reserves combined,
that is too much—-it means too much risk for both
creditors and shareholders. The remedy is a rapid
increase of reserves (by sitting hard 'on the divi-
dends) or an increase of capital. Certainly, if no
trouble happens, the more of the public’s money the
shareholders have to play with the better;' but
trouble has a habit of happening. Naturally, since
Hie bank is taking big risks, the profits are large.
Un the basis of capital and reserves combined they
show up as follows:
- ’ £4 2 11 P ' C - I 1908 ■ • £5 15 2 P-C.
1907 .. 6 0 2 „ I 1910 .. 10 5 7 ”
That Ikst line tastes very sweet. But the conditions
under. which it is earned will be kept in mind by
the man with whom safety is the first consideration.

Look down that first column, and you will see that
it takes a philosopher to be a perfectly contented
pursuer of the Australian jumbuck. No doubt, if he
makes a good start by buying well, the sheep-raiser
can, with average luck, make a heap of money;
during the past seven years, for instance, there has,
perhaps, been no more profitable business in the
whole wide world, taking, of course, the capital in-
vestment into account. But big losses can come just
as promptly as big profits. Thus the foregoing record
of this co. began with a loss of £38,092, and five
years later there was a profit of £22,329. The
trouble is that a lot of buyers don’t have a 12 or 15
or 20 years’ record in front of them when they buy ;
they glue their eye on the £22,329 profit, and the
£38,092 loss is carefully hidden from them—or
they hide it from themselves. The Bulletin isn’t
going to say that there will be such losses in the
future as there have been in the past. The extension
of railways and of artesian bore and' other stock-
watering facilities should do great things in the way
of diminishing losses. And no doubt the banks and
pastoral cos. have more sense. They formerly lent such
absurd sums on squattages that, in order to earn
interest, the station-man crowded on stock, and, be-
sides thus giving himself no chance, supposing he got
a pinch of drought, did the country much permanent
injury. To-day the average bank is very deaf on
that side when a man asks for more than a trifle on
a station leasehold; and, though here and there high
prices have been paid, there is nothing like the fury
of the ’Bo’s and very early ’9o’s. And the station
manager who would keep his grass eaten out like the
average manager of 20 or 25 years ago did, would
now get the sack —-if his owner knows half as much
as the average owner does know.
However, to get back to the Squatting In-
vestment Co. It bought Thurulgoona and Bun-
daleer in the furious ’Bo’s, and paid the
usual extravagant price—or, rather, owed most
of it. With a paid capital of under £200,000,
it had a debt of £250,000. That, as explained just
now, meant over-stocking; and rabbits did the rest.
For a long while the co. had just as much as it could'
do to pay interest, let alone dividend; and another
£lOO,OOO of capital was got in from the groaning
shareholders to lighten the load. With good seasons
the co. has made a very good recovery indeed. In-
stead of bursting into enthusiastic dividends, it has
kept its disbursements very modest; and, though its
reserves are still microscopic, it has put a lot into
improvements, and has written down assets as debt
has been paid off. To-day there is practically no
debt; the total owing to bankers and depositors is
£20,716, and the wool clip in hand on December 31
was valued at £22,190 net. The profit, as shown in
the table, is certainly not much on a capital of
£292,000 ; but-it is net profit. The following shows
the amounts written off station, improvements and
plant;—
1903 .. .. £679 1907 .. ..£12,409

1905 .. .. 4,8 5 1909 .. .. 17,654
1906 .. ..11,158 1910 .. 14,079
And since nothing like that much has been spent on
new improvements, the profit written off has been
available to pay off debt, a,s explained above. What
the pastoral future is going to be nobody knows ; but,
though the leasehold tenure is a little uncertain, the
co., ridded of debt, certainly faces the future with
about 100 p.c. better than its original prospects.

This belated notice refers to one of the half-dozen
Melbourne cos. which formed the brewery combine
between four and five years back. It was one of the
amalgamations which deserve more cheers than
groans. Melbourne had been shockingly over-
breweried, with the result that there was” a vast
amount of waste, which wasn’t good for the people
whose money had been poured into the businesses,
for the employees, or for the people who eat the beer.
This co.’s interest in the combine (Carlton and
United Breweries) was £72,000 face value; and
since most of that represented goodwill, this co.
squared its accounts by entering up on the other
side—“ Assets Realisation account, to provide for de-
preciation of assets, £49,088.” (It was a trifle
more than that originally.) Last year the combine
paid 10 p.c.; in 1909, 6 p.c.; 1908, 3 p.c. (but that
year the co. paid for a good deal of plant out of
revenue) ; 1907, 3 p.c. What it is going to pay in
the future this paper doesn’t know, having mislaid
its Elijah robes; but if it can keep at 6 p.c., this
co. can pay 9 p.c. on its capital with its whack.
Besides the share in the combine, the co. has a
brewery, malt-house, and a little hotel property; and
though they don’t bring in much, they bring in
more than enough to pay all office and manage-
ment exes.

An unusually large amount is shown as written off
for the past half-year; but that is because £1250 of
the' profit is appropriated for new plant. Possibly
not enough has been written off as a regular thing
hitherto; though, there was certainly nothing at all
to suggest neglect in that respect. On the eum.rary,
the book-value of plant has been regularly reduced
by 10 p.c. and rolling-stock by 20 p.c. p.a. The
extra allowance now, therefore, probably implies no
more than extra caution. The position generally is
very good. The paid capital is only £10,052; so
the reserves exceed the capital—and,” as before sug-
gested, they appear to be real reserves. Certainly,
£'18,625 is invested in pub properties, on which,
there is a mortgage of £ 9500 ; and pub properties
are doubtful properties in these days when the un-
doubted tendency is towards “reduction.” There is
that risk which no pub-owning brewery co. can
escape; apart from that, this Tittle concern is on an
unusually good wicket.

These accounts ought to be referred back to the
auditors. Twelve months ago there was a Profit and
Loss balance of £584. This has disappeared, and 1
there is no inkling as to what has become of it. If
assets to that extent have been written off or written
down, it should have been mentioned. If that hasn’t
been done, it is impossible to see how a balance
could have been struck. On the Profit and Loss ac-
count a surplus of £B4O is disclosed for the past
year; but in view of the disappearance of the pre-
viously mentioned £584, there has been nothing for
it but to strike off that amount and show the profit
as the above-mentioned £256. The amount paid on
“investigating” shares is £11,929; and there are no
deposits or other public liabilities. The capital is
practically all in mortgages; and, in view of the
liability of the country town to shrinkage, under
the bad Australian system of bloated capitals, the
reserves would be all the better for being stronger.

The Bulletin cari only repeat, with regard to the
accounts of thiS co., that the law which is satisfied
with them is too easily satisfied to be entitled to
respect. Apparently, things have improved with the
co. during the year ; anyway, the overdraft has been
reduced from £6228 to £2960. For the rest,
it is almost impossible to be sure about any-
thing. Whether the reserve is a real re-
serve, or whether it is merely a set-off
against wear and tear, The Bulletin doesn’t
know. And whether the £2OOO which has dropped
into the reserves during the year is profit, or whether
it is merely provision for actual depreciation, this
paper doesn’t know either. Assuming, however,
that it is the latter, and that the £1345 is the true
profit, the result is still excellent, considering that
the paid capital (excluding forfeited capital) is
only £1429.

Besides that £28,991, the co. made £9238, which
has been w-ritten off against depreciation. Unfortu-
nately the profit comes from stored by-products, and
none at all from actual mining. The half-year’s
history may be stated this way:—
Current by-products .. .. .. £10,953
Stored by-products.. .. .. .. 35,932

Gross Profit.. .. .. £41,926
Less administration and taxes .. £3697
Depreciation .. .. .. 9238
12,935
Net Profit .. .. ..' £28,991
The current production thus panned out as follows:
By-products £10,953
Silver-lead (loss) 5,810
Profit . .. .. .. .. £5,143
And from that has to be deducted administration,
taxes and depreciation; and that would leave a net
loss on the half-year’s operations. Only the stored
by-products save the situation. Until recently credit
was taken for the current output of by-products
at only a small figure; now, however, that the output
has been sold, credit for the full value is taken.
The sale was made at ss. 3d. per ton, less 21 p.c.
The outlook for the Block 10 mine is just about
as poor as it can be. The area adjoins the Broken
Hill Prop, on the south. The main Broken Hill ore
body is apparently shaped like an upended V. Block
10 is somewhere near the apex. While, therefore,
it had exceptionally rich ore near the surface, it
looks as though it will lose the body altogether very
soon. It certainly has got the lode at 1715 ft. —
the deepest workings thereabouts —but the ore is
at present prices not worth having; it is small and
poor and dreadfully hard and intractable. Better
stuff may be got; but there is no sound basis for any
optimism on the point. The development in this
mine simply supports the gloomy view as to this
central section of the lode obtained from the bottom
workings in the adjoining Broken Hill Prop. The
directors have not been ostriches, like so many Boards
are under similar circumstances; they have, there-
fore, been on the look-out for other properties. They
have got hold of a few prospects, but nothing so far
that seems likely to make any stir. The old Rising
Sun, a mile or two south of the Broken Hill outcrop,
has been prodded by a shaft and the diamond drill;
but only a low-grade sulphide body has been found—-
nothing to make a meal for a large co. The Com-
stock, on the Tasmanian West Coast, is of the same
sort. This property has consequently been handed
over to tributors.
The most, if not the only, satisfactory feature of
the co. is that its financial position is strong, so that
if any good thing comes along it has the cash as
well as the organisation to handle it. If it were not
for this organisation—which, in practice, may or may
not be worth much —nothing could be said in favor
of putting the money into other concerns. A good
deal can certainly be said against it. The directors
have the right, no doubt, to buy other properties;
but, after all, the people who have bought shares
in Block 10 have backed Block 10 and not any other
property. However, the financial management of the
co. has always been uncommonly cautious, and the
shareholders have every reason to trust it now. The
surplus of liquid, assets oyer liabilities amounts to
£143,084; this includes £64,978 to be received
on account of the stored by-products. It is impos-
sible to say what the mine is worth. No estimate of
reserves is made now; 12 months ago it was rec-
koned that 600,000 tons could be safely got out if
production wasn’t rushed. Since then approximately
103,000 tons have been extracted. But, as shown
above, there is little or no money in that part of
the business. Still, even if only enough profit is
made to pay for depreciation, it will mean putting
cash into the pocket of the co. to wipe out the
capital cost of the plant, etc., which still stands in
the books at £83,146. There are 100,000 shares in
the co., and they stand in the market at a shade over
30s. The surplus of liquid assets represents about
28s. Obviously, the market does not put a high
valuation on the mine asset or the plant. It is quite
likely that it under-estimates the probabilities.
The Burns-Philp re-arrangement, lately
described here, isn’t going through on ball-bearing
wheels. Senior counsel has been chewing over the
position of contrib. shares, and believes that, to avoid
possible litigation, further consideration ought to
be given to the matter. So the scheme has been
hung up for a while, and other proposals are being
considered.
Broken Hill Block 14 made a profit
of £11,814 in its past half-year. It wrote off £2611
for depreciation, paid 10 p.c. on its pref. shares
(£1500), and divided Is. per share (£10,000).-
Pref. shares, besides bagging their 10 p.c., join in
this last-named distribution. As for some time past,
all the profit came from scraping up carbonate ore
overlooked in the early days. It happens that the
patches found during the past few months have been
unusually rich; hence a bigger profit has been made
in spite of higher costs. There are practically no
known reserves of this ore; the co. just lives from
hand to mouth, and the prodding of the mine for
new bunches becomes more difficult and more costly.
Besides the carbonates, there are known reserves of
220,000 tons of sulphides. The Murex process has
been tried on this ore; but, “although much good
work has been done, it is not considered quite suit-
able for the class of material which we have to
offer.” So George Weir, of the North, and formerly
of Block 14, has been called in to advise. Mean-
time, with £72,883 of cash in hand, the co. is look-
ing about for new mines; and though J. H. Fawcett,
tbe cods adviser nr such matters, has sampled a few,
there is only one which looks at all hopeful, and
that one is being probed further on a working
option.

The Great Cobar management is at log-
gerheads with the N.S.W. railways, and there is wild
talk of a shut-down of the whole business if the
Commissioners don’t come to heel. The public had
better refrain from throwing any bricks at its own
railway-manager Johnson in this instance until it
knows some more of the facts. In the first place,
though this paper has a good opinion of Bellinger’s
metallurgical work, the business management of the
concern has been peculiar, not to say often pig-
headed. And it is more than possible that the
financial position is such that the co.’s bosses would
be very glad to make what military tacticians call
a diversion.
From out West: Great Cobar's manager
(Bellinger) talked to the Cobar Herald the other
day, and everything in the garden was lovely. The
wages-sheet will probably amount to half a millioD

m?ne as underground manager Bellinger is under-
stood to be introducing more Yankee heads, and if
they are kept moving at the same rate as the local
uroduct, the American passenger boats will benefit
in return fares. Cobar Gold Mine is still being
worked in a hand-to-mouth fashion. To work this
property economically, a new shaft, with air-com-
presser ' boilers, winding engine, rock-breakers, etc.,
placed together about 500 ft. north of the present
shaft, are necessary. The co. is preparing to prospect
Ihe old North Chesney shaft on the southern end ot
Cobar Gold Mine leases. There is a big run ot
country between the Chesney and Cobar Gold Mines
shaft well worthy of prospecting. Another property
of the co. not yet half prospected, though it has
large possibiliies, is the Great Peak. I ributors are
netting some soz. stone there. Experiments are still
being carried on, with a view, no doubt, to ti eating
the Cobar Gold Mines and Chesney ores bv some
other process than smelting, and the shareholders
may possibly be asked to find the money before long
for another treatment plant, and also to straighten
up things on the present plant and mines. Industrial
matters are practically settled now for three years
or so. The only murmur of discontent arises through
the introduction of Bulgarians, etc, and there may be
trouble if this labor is smiled upon by the manage- '
ment.

At Neeld’s, the bonanza of the Wyalong
field (N.S.W.) in the early days, prospecting at
900 ft. is still being carried on in the hope of meet-
ing with the lost shoot; but the results are entirely
disappointing. The owners have bored 150 ft. to the
east, and are now going west. The lieep-it-Dark
and Junction Amalgamated are raising the average
small quantity of rich stone. A property that is
likely to be heard of soon is the Erin’s Isle, which
is now being worked on tribute; but will shortly,
in conjunction with an adjoining lease, be put into
a scrip concern. Apart from that, depression still
swings like a corpse over the field.

Cosmopolitan, Hillgrove (N.S.W.), crushed
548 tons' for 3400 z. smelted gold from platds, and
concentrates containing 320 z. Including the latter
the average pans out less than 14dwt. per ton,
which is far below expectations. The numerous
assays of over loz., mentioned in the progress re-
ports, have not been verified by the battery. In
spite of this warning to be careful the stopes over
No. 3 level are described as worth ljoz. per ton
(25dwt., worth 3s. 6d. per dwt.) for a width of 20
inches. No doubt the low-grade stuff from the base
level partly accounted for the low average yield;
still it is not a sufficient explanation, because 98
tons were raised from the No. 2 level, that gave an
average assay of 27dwt. (£4 14s. 6d.). Taking
gold at £3 10s. per 0z., : a large proportion of the
stone raised was valued on assay at over £4 per ton,
and it is disconcerting to find the battery doesn’t
give anything like that value.

Lake View Consols meets shareholders in
London on May 22, when another shuffle will take
place. Provided the world doesn’t end in the in-
terim, it will be proposed to. wind up the present
concern and give scrip owners share for share in a
new co. of 350,000 10s. shares. In otherwords, one-
half is to be chipped off the present nominal capital,
and the roundabout way mentioned above is being
taken to achieve that result. The accounts to June
30, 1910, submitted on November 2, 1910, showed
the co. to have had on that date £121,938 in cash,
loans and investments; £24,366 worth of good
debts; and a whole host of saleable and unsaleable
lines, including 13,000 Zinc shares, 66,425 Broken
Hill South Blocks, 130,994 Hannans Star Consoli-
dated, 126,999 old Hannans Star 2s. shares (which
recently paid Is. 6d. per share cash), and 126,999
Lake View-Stars. Anyone wanting to know what the
other lines were that the co. had on hand can get all
the information in B. 16/3/’ll.

Fortune still favors the Golden Ridge
(W.A.). Last half-year’s working profit amounted to
£38,335, and, after deducting £4459 for develop-
ment and depreciation, and paying two eighteen-
penny dividends, there still remained a trifle to carry
forward. Ore reserves, blocked out on three sides,
are estimated at 42,000 tons, of a recoverable value
of 425. ; and the manager states that there are also
6000 tons of sands, 8500 tons of slimes, and 135 tons
of concentrates, from which he expects to recover
95., 165., and 1295. per ton, respectively. Develop-
ment work during the past half-year has been mainly
confined to the No. 5 level, where values, though
payable, have been lower than prospects indicated
at the date of the previous half-yearly report. Some
months ago an underlay winze was started from the
main west crosscut at the 500 ft. level, a little south
of where the best values were obtained in the drive.
To date this winze has been sunk 71ft. in ore aver-
aging 30s. for a width of 48in. It is intended to
continue sinking to 600 ft. before opening out. This
work is expected to have an important bearing on the
future of the mine, and settle the question whether
developments at depth warrant the sinking of the
proposed new main shaft. The accounts show the
co. to be still flush of monej', the total in hand on
March 31 (including £4OOO bullion reserve) being
£15,388.
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) has just wound
up another successful year. Accounts show that after
writing off £8495 for depreciation, and deducting
£ 8635 for income and dividend taxes, a profit of
£112,360 was netted. Out of this sum, with the
balance brought forward, dividends amounting to
£97,500 have been paid, and £15,000 has been
added to the reserve, leaving £3974 to be carried
forward. When the year closed the co. had £69,731
cash in hand, besides £16,445 gold in transit and
other substantial assets, including a mine with an
estimated dividend value of about a guinea, a big
bullion reserve and £10,112 worth of stores.
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) has resolved to
follow the lead of other big Westralian gold-mining
cos., and “go gay” in another land. An interest has
been secured in a Porcupine venture, and, according
to the London Board, “business likely to become
profitable has already been secured.” But where do
the State Treasurer and the dividend-seeking share-
holder come in? Already hundreds of thousands of
pounds, representing profits derived from gold-mining
in the West, have been put into mostly speculative
ventures in other parts of the world, and the desire
to get rid of surplus cash in this way in preference
to distributing it among shareholders, and paying
dividend tax, is becoming more pronounced every
year. At present the State levies a 5 p.c. tax on
dividends; but as only a comparatively small pro-
portion of the real profits is paid out, it gets a
good deal less than it is entitled to. If this con-
tinues an income tax will have to replace the divi-
dend tax.
The Bullrush Co. has stopped work on
its 12 Bullfinch leases, and decided to look for gold
elsewhere. The Bull Ant is also getting ready to
follow suit, and at the time this par was written
it was negotiating for the purchase of the Corinthian
North from the Oroya Exploration, Ltd. The
number of Bullfinch cos. bent on clearing out in-
creases each week, and it looks as if the Prop, will
have nearly the whole field to itself before long.
After months of hesitation Bullfinch Prop.
(W.A.) recently began to sink on the rich ore show-
ing in the bottom of the old prospecting workings.
When Bft. had been sunk, however, work ceased.
The official explanation of the stoppage is a heavy
influx of water. Somehow the co. is always bump-
ing up against something that bars the way. First
of all, the dip of the shoot necessitates a new shaft
being sunk to prove it at 200 ft. ; then the possibility
of hard country not being reached at that depth eggs
the management on to say that they may have to go
deeper before opening out, etc. ; now comes the
water difficulty. What with all this load of trouble on
its back, and with the fact that, although some
£600,000 worth of oxidised ore was officially re-
ported to be in sight some months ago, something has
cropped up to delay the installation of a treatment
plant for a year or'so, the mine authorities must by
this time be badl - crushed in spirit. Why don’t they
buck up and get out some of the £600,000 with the
aid of a 10- or 20-head stamp mill?
Whim Well Copper Co. (W.A.) has de-
cided to go in for the Murex Magnetic process. Ex-
perimental tests made in London gave recoveries of
from 80 to 93 p.c. copper, and the Board reckons
that equally good results will be obtained when the
ore is handled in bulk at the mine. A 200-ton plant
is to be erected to start with, and when in full
operation it is expected to produce between 200 and
260 tons fine copper a month. The management also
claims that good results are being obtained from de-
velopment, and that from 50,000 to 60,000 tons of
broken ore are now lying on the surface. Shipments
for the first quarter of this year yielded 307 tons
fine copper.

Dunn’s Find, near Mertondale (W.A.),
is the latest big gold-speck that Adelaide has before
its eyes. The locality has been worked off and on
by struggling prospectors for years, but, though some
of the ore crushed well over the ounce, there was
little or nothing left for claimholders after the cost
of cartage to the nearest mill had been paid. As a
result, a number of apparently good shows were
abandoned. Now that capital' and some of its
friends have been induced to come along, the ground
is being re-pegged in all directions, and all kinds
of fancy prices are being asked for leases. So far
as The Bulletin can learn, the “find” has good
prospects of developing into something good, but
nothing has been unearthed so far to make a big
song about. It will be time enough to whoop when
water-level is reached —that is, provided values are
maintained in hard country.

“R. 8.” : “Oofbird” (B. 11/5/T1) says
that I take his breath away, and I hope this will
take it away permanently. What I know of the
Bull Ant flotation is this: There was no prospectus
issued in Australia; Australian applications for
shares were made by cable. I was told that Qrut
had reported 2Joz. ore. I made inquiries, and three
or four men supported the statement that Grut had
sampled the show for these values. I did not know
then that Doolette had made a report; if I had
known of it I would have discounted it, as he was a
vendor, and consciously or unconsciously a man
thinks the best of his own. On the published state-
ments as to what Grut had reported, I applied for
shares, and later dropped them at a loss. “In a
clumsy sort of way,” who is “Oofbird” trying to
shield? Grut? I did read Mines Inspector Crabbe’s
report in December; and although I at first half
believed the rebutting statement that he had sampled
only the vein and not the schist, I afterwards cut
the loss. I went into the show on what I heard of
Grut’s report; I did not know that the values had
either not persisted or could not be substantiated
until after-the middle of December, and when I first
heard of it I was too ill to trouble, not then caring
who stole my portmanteau. If “Oofbird” knew the
valuelessness of the show then, why didn’t he say
something ? And if he’s only wise after the event—
as usual—it’s a very cheap stunt. He doesn’t know
that any English widows, orphans and country
curates had a Bull Ant share; but he says so, bal-
ancing wisdom after one event with knowledge before
the other. He says that “Grut’s opinion was only
used in conjunction with some vague remarks made
by Great Boulder Hamilton about the Bullfinch
field.” We’ve heard about this “vague use” before.
Was Grut paid for his report, and if he was, and the
report was favorable, are we asked to believe that it
wasn’t used?
The Oaks field, off the Etheridge line,
in North Queensland, sent an eloquent missionary
south recently to sound the loud timbrel. He blew
hard and often, and produced specimens on the
smallest provocation. It isn’t the South’s fault if it
has had the idea that the Oaks reefing field has a
number of leaders and narrow reefs for a backbone.
Even to this day the telegrams from the North refer
to 6in. veins of rich stuff. If there are 20ft. forma-
tions, they are never mentioned. Yet the missionary
proclaims that upon such things the future of “the
most promising goldfield in Queensland” is to be
built. The Oaks Rush Co. has got to the sulphides
—they have come in at under 150 ft. —so the future
is being contemplated with much confidence.
Durham Consols, an Etheridge (Q.)
pioneer, uses the loud pedal in its half-yearly
report. “The directors wish to emphasise the fact
that you have a highly payable lode in your deepest
ground, and one that promises permanence; also to
congratulate you on incidentally providing the most
important discovery to date on this extensive gold-
field. Others may now invest with confidence Where
you could only speculate with hope.” This deepest
working is a crosscut at 750 ft., which found a
“strong mineralised lode, the first samples from which
assaved nearly 50z.” However, it isn’t available
until there is better ventilation, which is to be pro-
vided by a winze now going down from 650 ft. There
are 99,790 live ss. shares in the eo., with Is. Id.
uncalled on them; and a trifle of this will have to
be got in before returns can be expected.

Golden Horn, at Mount Leyshon, 18
miles from Charters Towers, is attacking a large
deposit with much energy. The mill, of 20 stamps,
has just put through 2240 tons for £1026, an aver-
age of 9s. 2d. per ton, which beats the previous
record of Bs. Id. per ton. Both crushings were pay-
able. Working costs are probably the lowest in
Queensland; it is claimed that 10 men can mine
and truck 100 tons per day, which means that the
crushing stuff can be landed into the hopper for be-
tween Is. and Is. 6d. per ton. Mount Bischoff cer-
tainly can mine, truck and crush for 3s. 6d. per ton.
But Bischoff is making for an output of 20,000 a
month, and this large tonnage reduces administrative
expenses; and, besides, Bischoff is in low-wage Tas-
mania. The hill at Mount Leyshon is 700 ft. high,
and the open cut 200 ft. below the summit. The
stuff has to fall 300 ft. to get into the hopper, from
which it passes to the stone-breaker. Water has to
be pumped two miles, but its use is economised by
a producer gas plant, which drives the machinery.
An energetic Melbourne crowd has the very interest-
ing proposition in hand.
Hampden-Cloncurry (Q.) lias struck
What looks like a low-grade pyritic formation at the
350 ft. level from No. 3 shaft. It is probable that,
in addition to a fair tonnage of high-grade ore,
this end of the lease will develop extensive ore-
bodies that will come in handy for fluxing. The as-
say for copper on entering the pyritic body was only
14 p.c., and the flow of water was so heavy that
further progress has been delayed. The feature of
Duchess development is the continued sinking of the
winze from the 400 ft. level in fair values. The
co.’s reserves now figure at 228,300 tons, containing
21,655 tons of copper.
St. Mungo, some SO miles from Clon-
eurry (Q.), declares its fifth sixpence, making a
total of 2s. 6d. per share (£1250). The little
show gets some attention because it was placed on
the market in a reasonable way. Still, the co. has
to send off a painful quantity of metal to keep the
dividend going. The mine is, however, only a few
miles from the Hampden’s Duchess, so it isn’t badly
situated if the railway goes out. The feature of the
show is that its narrow vein follows the contact of
two rock formations, and occasionally widens into a
horizontal deposit of copper. An enrichment of this
kind may give 40 tons of rich ore in a fortnight.
These deposits are suDposed to have been formed by
the copper solution replacing portions of the felsite
hanging wall. The old Burra Burra (S.A.) produced
many thousand tons of 22 p.c. ore from somewhat
similar deposits; but, unfortunately, this kind of
mine is liable to an almost complete cut-off at depth.
» * * * >■
Vulcan Tin (N. Queensland) has greatly
improved prosnects at the 600 ft. level, where a big
stope, 27ft. x 24ft., is being worked. The winze
from the 540 ft. level carried good values, and a drive
south will come under this ore body. The output for
April was only worth £906, from 390 tons; but
much better results are expected for May and some
months to come.
No. 3 North Columbia, Gympie, has much
improved prosnects; both the eastern and western
veins are likely to provide some payable crushings.
Eastern stopes 'show 3ft. of crushing stuff, while the
stone on the western wall also shows a little gold.
Specimen stone has been culled from the stopes, and
the present workings at 1656 ft. vertical are in favor-
able country—which is everything at Gympie. This
mine lately crushed 614 tons for £1909.
Mount Lyell (Tas.) has on show a big
specimen of bornite and copper glance, estimated to
contain half its weight of copper, which came from
the deepest level —1100 ft. from the surface. This
rich ore reminds one that the North Lyell made itself
famous by shipments of 30 p.c. ore to Europe; but
it is very unlikely that an enrichment in tne deeps
will equal the superb ore body worked in the shal-
lows. Still, it is quite on the cards that the
North’s output will carry increased copper values.
This deep ore body has been proved to be 90ft.
long by 30ft. wide. A patch like that will make
it easy for Sticht to level up the output, and pre-
vent the half-yearly profit from declining below
£90,000, or Is. 6d. per share. One view is that
this deep enrichment will add from 500 to 1000 tons
of copper to the yearlv output; but it isn’t likelv
that a temporary system of forced production will
be followed, especially with copper at present low
prices.
The manager of the Tasmania Gold Mine
(Tas.) has cabled to London that the recently-an-
nounced discovery at the 1250 ft. level has turned
out to be only a branch of the main lode. It will
give about 100 ft. of payable stone, which isn’t much
for a concern that is heavily loaded.
Mount Balfour Mine (Langford’s Tas-
manian show) is adorned in regal purple ever since
Governor Barron turned the first sod of the co.’s rail-
way. . Wilson, railway engineer Merz’s.. partner, was
got to look over the scheme. From Langford’s pocket
now peeps the corner of a well-thumbed copy of
What Wilson Thinks. Wilson ought to 'know some-
thing about railways and electricity, but he can’t
talk authoritatively about the Balfour mines or the
land away from the railway route. So Langford may
be recommended to put on a first-class mining en-
gineer to chase up facts about the Balfour field be-
fore he trots off to London to float his railway and
mines co. His proverbial luck has to battle against
the fact that Central Balfour has failed to hit the
lode at depth. The writing down that had to be
done over the Briseis prospectus estimates is also
not forgotten; so Langford will want a bigger min-
ing gun than Elcberg to satisfy London.
There is a whiff of real trouble in the re-
port of New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), and it is
just as well to note it eariy. In the main drive, the
ground at a short distance from the shaft got so
heavy that double lining has had to be put in. While
this may not be unusual in deep-lead mines, the
trouble at the Cathcart has to be remembered, as well ,
as the Rutherglen cost of keeping drives open. The
worst croakers recall the loss of the two shafts of
the old Langi Co. But there is a difference between
the two cases. Those two shafts went down on the
gutter, and were twisted out of sight when the wash
was reached. New Langi Logan is not inviting
trouble like that, its shaft being in safe ground. No.
1 bore is to be put up 800 ft. from the shaft. If the
bores from that point onward get good prospects,
then look out! Seeing that more than half the way
to the site of the first bore is driven, the fun ought
soon to begin. The worst is that “capital” is peg-
ging out land higher up the lead, and won’t do any
devilling on its own account. The Minister ought
to shake up these birds.

North Nnggetty Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.),
has done its first six weeks at the mill, and comes
out with hair cropped pretty short; 1116 tons
treated for 608 oz. works out )oz. dirt, most of
which came from the brown stone at No. 2 level.
This is friable stuff, otherwise one might sav “Go
to!” when manager Gullock says he had only 30
days’ clear run with his battery. It means nearly
four tons a day per stamp, which is well above
Victorian averages. The brown stone cuts across
from the east to the west vertical lodes, and has been
proved right to the western lode. At No. 4 level the
Nuggetty Ajax flat make has been followed to the
boundary. Then at No. 1 level fair stone appears,
and in the shaft 7ft. of nice looking quartz has been
cut. Thus there are four points of attack available;
but what is the quantity of stone in sight to justify
shares standing at above 205., and what is its average
grade? Both the Ajax and the Nuggetty are getting
down in gold contents, and the North return doesn’t
rattle up Daylesford stocks much, despite all the
clever talkers. Another 10 heads are to go on to
the North mill. Why not wait till more stone is
blocked out to see whether a bigger battery will give
profits to anyone save the machinery-maker ?

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in
transmission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller
Bearings save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent,
of oil, so one df the first duties! is naturally for
engineers to direct their special attention to these
bearings and to car boxes for trucks. Hyatts are
in continuous use in Cement Works, Ore Dressing
Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bushings ol
flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes Table is the “Wilfley.” It is continuous, and
consists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged
in a tank of slimes or material to be filtered. The
drum is covered with a filter cloth supported on
grooves on the drum, which are connected by means
of holes to the interior to allow the liquid to be
withdrawn. Through the trunnions at the ends of
the drum the vacuum pipe passes to the interior.
This pipe connects with the interior of the drum,
through which the liquid and air are withdrawn by
means of a vacuum pump. The filtered slime is re-
moved by a simple apparatus placed at or below the
level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly the
cake is removed, the surface of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately re-immersed in the? pulp
ready to receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the
sucking in of air, and consequent loss of vacuum
between the time the cake is removed and a fresh
one is forming. The residual liquid in the slime
cake is removed by distributing water over the sur-
face of the semi-dried cake. Owing to the fact that
the filter is circular in form, it will be seen that it
is continuous in operation, and has no complication
of valves to get out of order; furthermore, work is
being done continuously during the whole revolution
of the filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have the sole manu-
facturing rights of this filter.* [2

Extract from the Financial News, London
(29/8/1910: “A young life office has many diffi-
culties to contend against, and in its early years
the progress of its business must be comparatively
slow; rapid growth can only be expected when a
certain amount of success has already been attained,
and the business on the books has reached a total of
some magnitude. To this general rule, the Colonial
Mutual is certainly a striking exception. From the
outset, the Society has been remarkably successful
in obtaining business, and its rise to a position of

Tramping about all hours
of the night and day looking
for “crooks” and “promotion”
isn’t such a lovely job as you
may imagine—drunks as a
rule are easily enough picked
up, but there’s not much pro-
motion attached to running
them in, so it’s just as well
not to see them if you can
help it.
Do you know, I’ve often
thought if people would drink
nothing but tea—good tea
like Robur—their youngsters
would grow up to do likewise,
and there’d be little fear of
their ever becoming boosers
—and what a difference it
would make to us chaps—for,
though you’ll hardly believe it,
still, it’s true all the same—at
least nine out of every ten
cases that go through a police-
man’s hands are due to the
poor devils drinking stuff
that’s stronger than tea.
Now, by the look on your
face I believe you intend to be
one of the first to set a good
example. Here’s luck to you
you’ll find it no hardship if
you use Robur tea, especi-
ally if you use the No. i

know, and I’ve tried every
other.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, May 22, 1911.
My Dear Arini, —
With the exception of Sousa’s Band, the
opening of Parliament, and a pin-prick of
minor chords, last week eked out a miserable
existence on a mere pittance of news.
Sousa and his band have been marching
through high-priced performances of unusual
merit. The suffering rich had to pay 7s. 6d.
for the “best” seats, and they did it with
the enthusiasm which marks a man who
opens his mouth to have all his teeth ex-
tracted. The reasons for the stricken atti-
tude of wealthy citizens towards the Sousa
tariff were apparent on the first night. A
plain man, with a fat purse, can conscien-
tiously pay 10s. for the privilege of falling
asleep over Wagner during a season of
grand opera. But the Sousa band mixes
“lannhauser” with a Yankee shuffle, and
interlards “The Washington Post” with
blatant about Kelly; and the re-
marks about Kelly keep the plain man
awake. Not only is he kept awake, but he
stamps his feet and behaves with the cheer-
ful abandon of a person has paid a
mere 2s. for an entertainment of his own
choice. Another slice of Wagner, however,
makes him swallow Kelly and wakefully re-
member his grievance—he has paid 7s. Gd.
Wagner sits on his chest, “Washington
1 ost lias gone to his toes. He wears a
protesting sac suit; the gorgeous ladies of
his household are undressed as for grand
opera. The plain, rich man secretly prefers
a long beer to a sffort liqueur. Here both
are rammed down his throat at the same
time. He mixes his emotions, and erects a
tombstone to the memory of 7s. 6d.
Miss Virginia Root (soprano) and Miss
Nicoline Zedeler (violinist) are nondescript
m their plumage. The battalions of trunks
that are supposed to fortify an American
band must have sprung a leak in their main
planks before the opening night of Sousa’s
spirited march into high prices.
™ A u S ? are ’ pale man > who is one of Sousa’s
GU, holds the breathless billet of maid-of-all-
work in. the notable band. He occupies a
aa j r £ a * s * ng P oB^oll trust in the back row,
and has to vigorously attack several instru-
ments in rapid succession. He works at a
speed of t 0 miles an hour, and is so dizzying
to look at that people who get giddy if they
peer over the edge of a precipice have to
take an antidote by glueing their eyes on an
adjacent musical snail, who carries his huge
curly brass house on his back.
The Lady Dudley farewell presentation
rally had its first meeting last week. Mayor-
ess Allen Taylor presided. Mrs. T. H
Kelly stage-managed this gathering as hon!
sec. Mrs. Burdekin, who was asked to take
care of the cash, excused herself on the
ground that her speed-limit was already ex-
ceeded. Her solid objection to having the
glw 7 lloru treas -> and letting an under-
stndy do the work, wasn’t open to argument.
Mrs. Phil Morton agreed to take the billet.
Lady Eileen Knox, daughter of Maoriland’s
ex-Governor Ranfurly, is to be one of the
tour train-bearers to Mary, Queen of Eng-
land, when she goes to get her crown put on.
ilie royal lady has daringly decided to have
tour pretty daughters of the peerage, instead
ot the conventional pages, to attend her.
n f f u r, thi - s “ eets your eye, Arini, the
British Empire League will have lashed its
tail in the great hall of the ’Varsity. May
-.4 is its usual date for getting on its hind
tegs in public places. A new melody for
choral singing, to be used on this occasion,
is called Australians All.” George North
is responsible. The women’s branch of Bri-
tannia-polislies-the-VVaves League, by the
way, used to ease off its surplus excitement
by driving round the city in hired drags,
drawn by patriotic horses with large rosettes
and rather ribby exteriors. Martin Place
was the popular resort for this explosion of
Right h eeling, when it came to a climax with
a brass band and a perambulating orator •
but municipal by-laws are now liable to put
large white cotton gloves on any gathering
the traffic t 0 SaVG the Empire by obstructing
These Empire Day celebrations are
lmble to suffer from complications. The
smell ot Coronation fireworks is already in
the air. As a direct consequence, the aver-
<ig6 .school-child is immersing his grey mat-
ter in two distinct sets of odes, and needs
watching. He’s likely before this reaches
you, to burst Ins collar-band in a shrill
treble of thanksgiving for the anointing of
George and Mary, when he ought to be
switched on to Queen Victoria’s obituary
notices and the all-red route.
Mo T i le ol ard -7i n party , at Admiralty House on
May 25 will be a dressy postscript to the
Empire Day flutter. It is usually an offi-
cial waste-paper basket into which are flun-
the social odds and ends who don’t break
bread with Personages on any other excuse,
and form a meek tail (never mentioned by
name) to the flaunting “Amongst those
present.” It’s the Admirable ffing-HaH’s
first afternoon party.
Acting-Under-Secretary Dawson, of the
Education Department, is sitting on a rather
spiky gate. State-school teachers are cau-
tiously giving the gate a kick towards a
week’s June holiday, “in honor of the Corona-
tion.” The teacher is the chief sufferer when
the child has to be hurled at passing events
as a public spectacle. And he naturally
feels that the fag of guiding the Young Idea
through bunting riots on May 24, and keep-
ing it in tune on Coronation Day, deserves
something more than official approval pigeon-
holed on blue paper.
The Women’s Patriotic Club threatens to
bury its politics with a butter-knife, or simi-
lar ferocious tool of female warfare, when
it moves its camp to Bligh-street. There
seems to be a loonhole for a women’s resi-
dential club in this town. Patriotic ladies
who hitherto nibbled the fancy cake of
undying devotion to the Deform League, in
Bull’s Chambers, have turned the fire-hose
on their former flame. They’re going to
get into the board and residence business
without delay, and let their suffering coun-
try save itself. Their suffering country will
probably go on booming. If the reformed,
non-political club manages its new residen-
tial hostel on sound commercial lines, it
ought to wipe a tear from the weather eye
of many unappropriated blessings, stray cats
and other homeless wanderers in the frowsy
precincts of suburban hasheries.
Mrs. “Washington Post” Sousa and her
daughters have been purred over by the
Women’s Patriotic Club, which has for-
gotten to reform its name. Cream puffs
and morning tea raged round Miss Virginia
Root and the lady fiddler at the same as-
sembly.
A note from “Akenehi,” who by now is
among the Chrysanthemums :
We are at Port Darwin, after a passage through a
sea that for calmness has been like unto the lake
over which Lohengrin’s enchanted swans drew his
boat. (I hope it was that Wagnerian hero; if it
wasn’t, look up and see if it was George Reid.)
From Brisbane to Thursday Island wo had the Gov-
ernor of Queensland on board. He is about the most
learned man whose deck-chair has ever been lined up
beside mine. Every day he writes up his diary in
French, German or Italian. Each page is nearly as
h l s I s a page of Thb Bulletin, and he uses one of
the three languages on each page. Ilis knowledge of the
private life of the mosquitoes of Australia, Labrador
and West Africa is quite uncanny. Only the Omnis-
cient can know as much, and if He knows more, I
can’t understand why He doesn’t destroy the whole
species. According to Governor Macgregor, the mos-
qui.to is the root of all evil. He was on his way to
visit a lot of footling little islands, and was to take
passage in the John Douglas. Next to the mosquito,
University, which he will open in June, is nearest
the dear man’s heart. Queensland is fortunate in
her Excellency—not because he is so mosquito-bitten,
b ? ea V s ® he has her interests so much at heart.
vv n°.n he left the Bishop of Carpentaria came on board
-—Gilbert White. He is more monosyllabic, but he
also is so intimate with the mosquitoes that he calls
them by their Christian and surnames—which I never
heard before, and cannot remember now.
Artist G. W. Lambert’s mother died at
last week > after a long illness.
G.W. had made all arangements for his
mother to visit England this year, to view
nis recent artistic triumphs, and, incident-
ally, the Coronation. But cancer intervened,
and an operation did not avail to save the
kindly sufferer.
The Mclntyre family is passing through
this town in an exodus from Tasmania to
hog Land. She was Miss Madge David,
and he goes to Edinburgh to pursue medi-
cine as a student. The rest of the family—
one soul all told—goes en suite, because it’s
too infantine to have its opinion asked about
the Scottish Sabbath.
The Admirable .King-Hall took his young
daughter to the Girls’ Realm Depdt, to have
her branded with the purple rosette of Guild
membership. This unexpected visit had such
an agitating effect on those present that,
when his Naval Ex. departed, two young
persons in the home-made jam department
had quince-jelly hysterics, and the rest were
prepared to bleach their bones with excite-
ment.
Mrs. and Miss Burdekin and Mrs. Alec
Day are among the Australians who intend
being at the Durbar. They will see the Vice-
roy s Cup—the race which is mostly won by
an Australian horse —before returning to
these parts.
i a f, iss ® lla Caspers is being feted by Eng-
land s Catholic nobility, as some slight re-
compense for her disastrous matrimonial ex-
perience. Kerrs, Howards, Radnors, Pley-
dell-Bouveries and the Duke of Norfolk all
turned up at an At Home in her honor,
last month, and pledged themselves to do
their level best to advance her fortunes.
Maoriland is making a pool in peerages
and their accessories. The recent marriage
of Miss Enid Elgar, daughter of a Waira-
rapa grazier, to Captain Hamilton, son of
Lord Claud John Hamilton, brings the Elgar
family into line with the Abercorn straw-
berry patch. Lord Claud is a High Steward
of the Borough of Great Yarmouth, and
probably keeps an eye on the bloater industry
when he isn’t playing football or racquets.
J he comparatively empty cradle may here
be mentioned, as the family consists of one
son and one daughter.
The second Duke of Abercorn, uncle to the
Guardsman who has married Miss Elgar, comes
from a family • which has kept on growing
barons of different degrees since 1587. Baron
of Paisley, Baron Abercorn, Baron of Stra-
bane, etc., meander through the family tree,
which contains, however, no mention of any
Baron of Beef. The Abercorn strawberry
leaves met the Bedford’s patch at the altar,
when Lady Louisa Jane Russell, daughter of
a Duke of Bedford, married the first Duke
of Abercorn. The office referee can, there-
fore, untie the following knot: If Miss Elgar
married a nephew of the present AbeVcorn
coruscation, what connection is she of the
Duchess of Bedford now touring Australia?
Bags, like those glorified kits in which the
beautiful Hussar presumably kept his scent-
bottle, love letters, etc., are now the craze for
the stylish woman who wants to be up to
next week in her smaller “impertinences.”
Heavily embroidered in a raised applique of
gold galon, with thick gilded cords like bell
ropes or steamer cables, tnese flat Hussar bags
get an airing at every dressy function. At
the Lady Dudley memorial meeting, a Pointer
(either Piper, Potts or Darling), who was
“bagged” in this style, drew the rope across
her lap, and became an object of secret envy
to mere women who were unable to get into
any kind of prize pen.
Patent-leather shoes, with sharp pointed
toes, and brown, grey or fawn uppers, are an-
other obsession of the moment. Mrs. Phil
Morton kindly put her slender feet into the
foreground of the same gathering.
According to the gospel of a London paper,
the plait is going to keep in the hairdressing
business as a more or less permanent feature
of the female head. The little curl still
makes a fluffy patch of small sausage-rolls
under the average hat, but its glory is said
to be on the wane. If you have sleek, fair
hair, the curled coiffure is a graceful evening
pose. For choice it ought to accompany a
theatre coat in the vivid shade of sapphire
blue which now buries itself under the thread-
bare label, “Coronation.” Mrs. George
Vivers, the other evening, wore one of the
new opera cloaks of blue velvet, with looped-

corn-colored curls.
Included in Norman Carter’s three-days’
exhibition of his work were two full-length
portraits of Mr. and Mrs. J. V. Tarte, of
Taviuni, Fiji. The British-born Tartes
have been cultivating cattle, cocoanuts and
robust constitutions in Fiji for 40 years or
so. _ During a recent holiday trip to Sydney
their athletic attack on local sight-seeing,
and agility in boarding the hurried city
tram, threw the lie in the false teeth of the
story that the white man is doomed to an
early death in tropic isles. Beatrice Grim-
shaw once stayed with the Tartes, and got
good local color out of their cocoanut patch.
Mrs. Tarte’s portrait is the graceful picture
of a sweet-looking old lady, with a mild mid-
Victorian pose, a trailing black gown, and
the foamy lace cap, with lappets, so much af-
fected by Poet Alfred Tennyson’s wife in her
later portraits.
The Mitchell-Meares wedding party, at
Rivihre College, was spangled with one of
the largest assortments of presents Suburbia
has seen for some weeks. Mrs. Mitchell can
give a tWo-step knife and fork display, or a
butter-cooler jamboree, with new and original
items, for at least one month.
One of the Greycliff Wentworth family,
George G. Wentworth, now in Queensland,
has put the eventful question to Miss Frances
Morris, a daughter of Mr. Richard Morris,
of Dalby (Q.). An engagement ring is the
result.
The Ernest Wunderlichs leave for foreign
parts by the Scharnhorst on Saturday.
Frank Lincoln, of the “Gay Gordons” Co.,
is an optimistic fisherman in his spare mo-
ments. Just now he is suffering from the
cold chill of hearing that his particular brand
of kilts will get to Maoriland during the
close season for trout fishing.
“The Dollar Princess” has either changed
or turned her collar since her last visit to
Sydney. Her pleated frills are less obvious
to the naked eye. Olive Godwin has the
agreeable task of looking nice as a Dollar
Princess. _ Florence Young keeps her voice
intact with all the freshness of its first
youth. As Olga Labinska, ex-lion tamer, she
has the presumptive right to be the best
dressed woman in the piece. Her first ap-
pearance, in a powder blue confection that
fits like a French glove, sends Dollar-man
Harry Q. Conder into a state of mild de-
lirium.
The Bachelor Scrubber, according to a Fog-
land writer, is taking the place of the lost
maid-of-all-work. We are vigorously im-
porting domestics from Britain, which hasn’t
enough to go round its own rainfall. They
are scratching Germany, France and Sweden
fQr traces of the missing link between com-
fort and chaos. Canada falls into line, and,
with large promises, lassos anything in the
shape of hired help. This international
scheme of wholesale pillage has developed
the London Bachelor Scrubber. He is laid
on to residential flats for general utility pur-
poses. He scrubs, washes up, gives the cat
a bad name, acquires tips and rations, and
departs early in the evening, to return with
the morning milk.
An occupant of a Bedford-street (Lon-
don) flat, who advertised for “an honest, in-
telligent man to do housework and cook,” at
a pound a week, got the hurried impression
that a suppressed street riot was surging
round the vicinity of his front door. It was
the simultaneous answer to his advertise-
ment. Hundreds of men were struggling for
the billet of one general servant.
The concert in aid of the Hospice for the
Dying is getting its programme into work-
ing order. Her Ex. of Dudley has taken
this fixture under her wing; and Dolores and
Mrs. Alex. Gordon are going to render first
aid. June 10 is the date. For those who
have to slip across the shadowy borderland,
the Hospice for the Dying (Darlinghurst)
is a last port of call. It examines neither
the teeth, purse, nor religious convictions of
the sufferer it finds by the wayside. Dives
occasionally gives it a helpful push, so that
Lazarus need not perish outside his gates.
Florence Imeson, the sprightly leading
lady in the “Gay Gordons,” narrowly es-
caped a flight in Johannesburg. Zimmerling,
then chasing castles in the air of S’Africa,
asked her to go upstairs in his aeroplane,
"I got as far as the dying ground, ana stayed
there. My courage oozed out somewhere,”
she mused, “and ‘Dadge,’ a well-known jour-
nalist, who was aching for the chance, took
my place. It was a successful fly, and
‘Dadge,’ who’s a tiny woman with a big
cargo of brains and pluck, scored for the
newspapers.” Florence met the spoor of
four lions in her recent S’African tour. The
comedy company’s arrival had been misre-
ported—as to dates —in jungle society. The
lions waltzed across the garden of the Vic-
toria Falls Hostelr' 1 ’ a day too soon, and
there were no presentation bites to greet the
Florence Imeson ankles.
“Mglodie Valse,” introducing Rubin-
stein’s melody in F, by C. Spencer, is pub-
lished by Paling and Co. This waltz grace-
fully side-steps the main theme —Rubinstein’s
melody—and is not too difficult for sweet six-
teen to try on the nice young man who’s
so polite to her mother.
Maurice Hewlett’s new book, “Brazenhead
the Great,” has just fallen into this letter.
Roycroft Library is responsible. Dressed
up in old-time mock heroics, it has sugges-
tions of the manner of “Sartor Resartus” in
the stringing together of quaint descriptive
matter. A flavor of Don Quixote —when he
wasn’t tilting at windmills —and a spice of
Falstaff in his most rollicking moods, go
towards the mediaeval patchwork. It’s
rather heavy reading, from the average-wo-
man viewpoint, and ought to be reasoned
with by Sydney’s Peace Society for its pro-
nounced wallow in gore. Captain Brazen-
head, slaying 300 Anabaptists with the thigh-
bone of a philosopher, is an episode to in-
cite gentle Rose Scott to heave a cough
lozenge at the inventor of the monster.

In the whole history of Australian bushranging no gang was more notorious than that cap-
tained by Ned Kelly. Various accounts of the doings of this gang have appeared, but none
bears the hall-mark of truth so pointedly as these leaves from a dead man’s diary, as edited by
Mr. Pratt, who has presented the story so convincingly that, for tense interest and exciting
events, it has few, if any, equals.
Dan Kelly was the only member of the gang who escaped the clutches of the law, and his
account of the last stand at Gflenrowan is a veritable human document.

A STECK PIANOLA PIANO
IS
THE
IDEAL
HOME
PIANO.
wuv
IS
THE
IDEAL
HOME
PIANO.
WHAT the Steck Piano will mean in your home.
It will mean that you can have music—the best of music—
whenever you want it.,
It will mean that you will always have an ever-ready means of entertain-
ing friends.
It will mean a constantly growing familiarity with an abundance of
beautiful music you may not, at present, even realise is in existence.
It will mean an important educational factor for the children—a
method of making them familiar with the world’s great composers, thus
supplying a deficiency in the educational system of most schools.
It will mean that you can familiarise yourself with the grand operas
that are to be sung this season by Madame Melba’s Grand Opera Company,
in advance of their production, or it will keep you in touch with the suc-
cesses of the comic-opera stage. And, above all, it will mean that instead of
just listening to music, you can play it. No one can tell you the tremen-
dous fascination of producing music. You must experience it yourself. And,
when you do, you will realise that for the first time in your life you are
learning what real musical enjoyment is. The STECK Pianola Piano, hav-
ing a Pianola inside its case, may be played by anyone. The presence of
the Pianola, however, does not interfere with the Piano’s use for hand-
playing and practice.
IMPORTANT.—If you have reached the point where music in the
home seems essential to the happiness of the family, do not make the mis-
take of supposing that there are other instruments just about as good as the
STECK PIANOLA PIANO.
Only at Pianola Hall can you obtain the PIANOLA and STECK
PIANOLA PIANO. Other firms have other players, for which extrava-
gant claims are made, but the PIANOLA continues everywhere to be
regarded as the Standard. It is the only instrument of the kind which has
the hearty support of the musical world, and which is bought by the most
discriminating class of purchasers here and abroad. Let us send you one
of our catalogues. We will send it free if you will write us. Ask for

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, Mat 22, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
When it came to parting, his Exit Carmichael
found out how fond he had grown of Australia;
and when he left the gubernatorial suburb of
Malvern on Friday he was within an ace of
shedding a tear on the local Town Hall doormat.
The arrival of a bunch of. councillors arrested the
tear before it fell ; but Australians can appreciate
the affectionate sentiments which were behind the
hastily-suppressed emotion. This country will
have no crier of frightful fish in the kindly
Carmichael.
Mayoress Davev invited all the women of
Melbourne who wished to say good-bye to the
Carmichael lady to a reception in the Town Hall.
The women rolled up so numerously that they
swamped the Collins-street corner and tangled
the traffic; but getting into the hall was
another matter. The ladies of the Wimmen’s
National League took up a defensive position in
the portico and held the fort, while mere females
were held back by the police. Only the possessors
of badges could get past the first line. Mrs. Alfred
Dealt in and Mrs. Doctor Strong* arriving late,
were held up at the barriers because they had
not their passports. They had to explain at
great length before they were allowed to hurry
indoors. The corridor-guards, with a solitary
man (the Mayor) in the van, had the main hall
fenced off with velvet-covered wire. Into this
empty paddock of floor-space the “received”
were to filter like tallied sheep. Meantime, the
harried flock waited outside in the street and im-
peded the community at large. The balconies
were full of spectators, and Mrs. Prof. Peterson's
woman’s choir sat in the organ gallery like so
many white-robed angels. Prof. Peterson him-
self, Major Kirby and an odd male reporter or two
lurked behind the platform screens. Captain
Vaux was in attendance, and his desperate efforts
to stem the rush of the avalanche upon his smiling
lady was an object-lesson in drawing-room
military tactics.
Lady Carmichael came in a peach of a frock :
the cloak and dress were both of the same delicate
tint—a pale lilac. She carried a big bouquet of
orchids and lily-of-the-valley, and sailed in with a
radiant smile.
The careful fortification turned the affair into a
social crush. When Lady Northcote farewelled,
the reception was really to all and every woman.
Mrs. Collingwood attended alongside Mrs.
Tooralc. I remember one woman who had put a
string of jet beads round her everyday “gem”
hat to smarten it up a bit; and some poor but
grateful women brought bunches of 'flowers and
presents of crochetted mats they had made them-
selves. On Tuesday the generally-invited women
were kept back until a big crowd had collected ;
then, when the barriers were at last down for
them, they were crushed in the big corridor like
so many frightened animals. It was all fearful
bungling.
The chief event of the afternoon, the presenta-
tion of the book of signatures, was got through
without accident. Two of the men-in-hiding
brought forth a mammoth brown parcel, which,
being opened, was found to contain a beautiful
Ikw made of Australian woods, carved by Mrs.
Blamire Young. Inside it were the various
specimens of female caligraphy dressed in a
beautiful cover.
The finale of the jumbled function is unknown
to your Johanna, who backed through an escape
door and, threading an Alice-in-Wonderland laby-
rinth of corridors in the uncompleted new wing,
found a waiting lift and slipped down to a side
door and the free air of Heaven.
Carmichael has amongst his luggage an address
in Gaelic, which he is conveying to King George
from the loyal Highlanders who dwell amidst the
crags of Collins-street and thereabouts. Perhaps
on dull, foggy afternoons, when there isn’t much
doing, George will put on his kilts and telephone
for the pipe band of the Black Watch to play it
over to him.
Among the hosts of mementoes pressed on the
departed Carmichael lady was a beautiful piece of
Irish lace, the gift of the Healesville branch of
the Guild of Irish Lacemakers. Though her Ex.
had made friends everywhere, the laceworkers
particularly bless her help. There is no way into
a domestic woman’s heart like a fellow-enthusiasm
in “five stitches drop three,” and the Carmichael
lady simply delighted in the domestic art of fine
stitchery. Under her inspiration the dving-out
Alices-who-sit-by-the-fire are making a frantic-
rally to recover ground ; and “ Arts and Crafts ”
are puffing at dull embers to revive the gentle art
iof lace-making. But it is a forlorn hope.
Machinery has routed the hand worker; and the
spinster and the matron who sat within stone
walls, spending their time turning flax into linen
and linen into garments, while they dreamed of
jknights and doughty deeds, are just about as dead
as athletics can make them.
The much-farewelled suffered their posi-
tively final send-off on Friday. A cold, rainy,
dreary day it was ; yet wherever the party was to
be held up, a crowd of enthusiastic people had
collected, with handkerchiefs waving like Mon-
day’s washing. After the party * had quitted
Stonington, Malvern Town Hal and a nest of
councillors made the first block. Aldermen
curbed the motors again at Princes Bridge.
After the usual toll of speeches, the cavalcade
got to the Treasury,- and the Governor ran in to
cash an I O U, or report himself for leave, or
some such thing. The Treasury steps held their.
full load of humanity, including brass band and
singing school children, who are more than human,
though less than the angels. Then the decorated
motors squeezed a way to the Town Hall. More
Gaud Mayor there, and much more corporation,,
with champagne and speeches. During the cor-
tege’s snail-sprint to Spencer-street, the Stock
Exchange came plutnply out upon its doorstep and
gave sundry cheers. The crowd all along Collins-
street blocked the traffic ; it was quite equal to a
Ducal demonstration. Finally, at the station,
demented railway men grappled with the sheep-
like flock, and ordinary passengers lost luggage
and temper in the fight. So the Carmichaels left,
fully convicted of popularity, and sentenced to pay
for it without the option.
The Carrnicks added forestry to their farewell
stunts. They both planted an evergreen tree in
the Botanical Gardens. Two pines with but a
single thought.
This Malvern, where the State Governors live, is
one of Melbourne’s shabby-genteel suburbs.
Malvern’s less-genteel sidewalks are half-asphalted,
or not asphalted at all, and the leas important
roads are punctuated with frequent puddles ; but,
since Malvern is shabby-genteel, it is just about
to spend £2OO of the ratepayers’ money on
“ Coronation festivities.” Malvern is a “loyal”
suburb all right—excepting to its ratepayers.
There was a ’Varsity “command night ” oh the
occasion of the penultimate performance of “The
Belle of Brittany,” and the student made the
usual monotonous Egyptian beast of burden of
himself. The fishiest joke of the evening was a
boiled lobster swung on strings across the theatre,
and trained to crawl on the bald head of the
respectable citizen in the stalls. Eventually the
scarlet insect was captured by an indignant female
in whose coiffure it had become entangled. Skulls
and thighbones were blended with the floral decora-
tions, and the intellectual giants of the future
devoted a preliminary half-hour and the intervals
to horse-play and jests which, if indulged in by
Hobnails at a political meeting, would have driven
the Argus to early-morning fury. As it was, this
unreasonable organ expressed childish delight in
the banalities of the l-ising degeneration.
A middling house witnessed the final night of
“ The Belle of Brittany” Co. at the Melbourne
Royal. There was little enthusiasm until the
close, when presents for the company started to
steeplechase from the stalls and collect in profu-
sion upon the stage. Miss Gilliam, who looked
on the verge of damping the occasion with a
douche of tears, received a couple of bouquets
and a mysterious silvered box. To Miss Con-
stance Lait was handed some bunches of blooms ;
while Tom Walls was presented with a noble
melon, which ought to keep his face busy for
weeks and weeks. The person who was most
annoyed by floral tokens was Miss Nellie
Kavanagh of the sparkling eyes. When this
report closed she was chest-deep in vegetables,
and could be distinctly heard calling for help.
The Society women of Washington, where the
U.S. A. politicians rage, are taking to the air and
competing with ope another for the distinction of
being first-flighters. Roosevelt’s daughter, Alice
Longworth, recently arranged for an overhead
trip, and was busily engaged choosing a costume
when another lady smiled at the merely-human
aviator, and meanly persuaded him to carry her
off first into the blue where the Bird of Freedom
hovers.
By the way, a London exchange mentions that
Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Ward, who spent some
months in Australia with their relatives, the
Dudleys, flew in England last month, Tabuteau,
the French airman, took them aloft from the
park of some duke or other of whose house-party
they were members.
The pedestal is up, waiting in a blank-looking
way for its.statue of Hopetoun. • It-stands in St.
Kiida-road, opposite the Barracks and outside the
gate of Government House—stands waiting
for the bridegroom-son of the first G.-G., who is
to unveil the completed monument.
According to after-camp accounts, G.-G.
Dudley proved a good sport at the Easter
military muster. Even when he shook salt over
his apple pie in mistake for sugar, he didn’t put
the mess-room orderly into irons. The sweets
came afterwards when at the sinful game of poker,
the G.-G. cleaned up the table. Whether that
was the result of particular poker-prowess on
Dudley’s part, or self-sacrificing Governor-worship
on the part of the officers, is not on record.
An elderly Japanese gentleman is visiting Mel-
bourne. His name is the usual complication ; his
mission, it seems, is to study ghosts. Evidently
they have heard in Tokioof the land-banks vim used
to have in the early ’9o’s. Besides his interest in
departed spirits, Mr. Chrysanthemum makes a
hobby of Chinese poetry. It seems that in
Chinese poetry you have to lead up to an abrupt
ending, the beauty of which is in its subtle sug-
gestiveness. You must not express the thought
in mere words, but must say something
or do something to make the reader see
the unspoken thought in his mind’s eye. I have
tnyself often noticed a subtle aroma hang-
ing around the Chinese quarters. I always put
it down to defective sanitary arrangements.
Who knows but that an Ah Milton on the
premises had merely forgotten to pin the subtle
suggestiveness to the paper ?
Dancer Daisy Coppin sends cheerful word of
her doings on the ’Murkan boards. She is with
the Mascotte Sisters, now showing in San Fran-
cisco. Amusement makers work hard in the U.S.
The Mascottes are giving seven shows on Sunday,
and never less than five on a week day. It is the
usual thing to be at the theatre solidly from mid-
day till 11 o’clock at night. The manager sends
out for food, so that there will be no time lost.
The Mascottes expect to arrive in New York in
time to meet “ Aunt Lucy,” as they affectionately
term Mrs. Bland Holt.
A postcard from Nice, where tennis tourna-
ments were in full swing last month, brings the
news that champion Dunlop, of this city, has
been playing with the King of Sweden. Dunlop,
who has his biother-in-tenms, Rod Heath, with
him, has been invited by H.M. to visit Stock-
holm, where he guarantees the Victorian player
no end of a good time.
The Bland Holts are still putting a tape-measure
round the earth. They were due in Noo Yark
this month.
-As I write this, Miss Margueretha Wannen-
macher is getting her satin, laces and bridesmaids
ready for May 24, when she is to say “ I will ” to
Mh James D. Ashburner, of Armadale, in the
Lutheran Church, Eastern Hill., The bride-to-be
has just returned from a European tour with her
mother.
Mrs. Gardiner, one of the prettiest of recent
brides, who with her doctor-husband lately set forth
on a round-the-world wedding tour, was at latest
advices resting at Suva. Pa Neptune was in an
angry mood when the couple’s ocean-ferry set out,
and Mrs. Gardiner proved to be such an indiffer-
ent sailoress that she had to be carried ashore.
Stage-manager Meyer, of the Clarke and Mey-
nell firm, has acquired a little bit of the earth at
Yea, where he has a select mob of sheep
growing wool for him while he is hustling
round the cities looking after mummers.
Mrs. Dorothy Grimston Meyer has given
up stage life, and she and the children keep an
eye on the lambs while Dad is away. The busy
husband generally drops off the express in his
frequent rushes ’twixt Melbourne and Sydney,
and hurries home to see that Scotch thistles
haven’t broken out in the wool-crop.
Miss Hilda Mulligan, the small Sydney singer
with the big, rich voice, sends a coo-eefrom London.
She has just concluded a tour with the Carl Rosa
Co., with which she roamed over Ireland, wearing
the national prefix O’ before her fine surname.
The little lady now has an open engagement with
Harnmerstein, who is building a theatre in
London for grand opera. Just at present she is
tucked away in a London flat with a little sister
and singing into gramophones, which, I under-
stand, is a most profitable pastime.
At a well-known Collins-street foodery, the two
divisions of 4 o’clock tea-sippers—the talkers and
their prey, the each their own
feeding grounds. The lynx-eyed gossips mass
themselves round the door, where the light is
good, and the talked-about take refuge further in,
where the electrics don’t altogether destroy the
restfhl gloom of the winter afternoons. People
who have settled down heavily, and habitually
wear spectacles, occasionally stray into this dim,
murmurous retreat, snort at the poor illumina-
tion, and then, realising that it is a perfect den of
wireless telegraphy, gather up parcels and fly to
the tables where the talkers gather.
A man drops in with a millinery item :
Fuss as they may, the kiltie is doomed as a military
rig-out in Australia. It is a fool of a dress for military
purposes in a climate like ours, and in actual service is
liable to be a danger as well. At Magersfontein a High-
land Brigade was forced to lie on its chest all day, and
the broiling sun, beating down on the unprotected calves
of the unfortunate kilties, twisted their muscles and did
such damage that the whole brigade wa< rendered un-
serviceable for months. Had they worn trousers they
would have suffered, of course ; but there is a big differ-
ence between being inconvenienced and crippled,
Magersfontein was the shocking example of the
war; yet right throughout the campaign the men in
kilts found themselves seriously inconvenienced by the
“classic” but ridiculous rig-out. If only on that experi-
ence, the Commonwealth’s infant Defence Department is
justified in shooing the petticoats off the premises, and
handing over a monopoly of them to your own priceless
sex.
The literary circle of the Swastika Club will
discuss the late Shakspeare's heroines at its
next afternoon. Beatrice, Miranda, Kosalind,
Imogen and Desdemona—the white girl who
married a nigger and was sorry for it—will all be
talked about as if they had lived out at Toorak
and wrestled with the help problem, like the rest
of us.
Just as this letter is being gummed down, the
glad news arrives that Mrs. Jim Osborne (who
was Miss Maud Jeffries) has presented her hus-
band with a girl-infant. Mrs. dim Osborne is the
only spouse of the “ Pat ” branch of the Osborne
family who wasn’t born and bred in Melbourne ;
yet is she none the less popular locally for that.
If Melbourne can find a few more girls like the
one who rescued a poor old man from the clutches
of a band of hoodlums the other night, this city
might form a force of women police. The old'
fellow, garbed principally in an ancient frock
coat and an elderly belltopper, was getting badly
hustled by the mob, in spite of the efforts of
several men to rescue him, when a smartly-
dressed girl pushed her way in, rushed him on to
the steps of a house, and kept the savages off until
a tram came along. Then she dragged the old
fellow across and bundled him aboard. At the
next stop she dropped off the car and disappeared:
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Alfred Thompson, who died in a suburb the other day,
was a Personage in a way: he drove King George and
brother Clarence from Adelaide to the Victorian border.
He was coaching for many years ; then, as usual, he took
a hotel.
Aciing-Mayor Lavington Bonython—a son of Langdon,
of the Advertiser—is paying for the Adelaide Corona-
tion festivities out of his own pocket. Cohen, the Mayor,
will personally Coronate ; and, as the council had already
made him the usual allowance, his locum tenens declined
a proffered special grant. The festivities will include the
entertainment of 3500 guests at the Exhibition. Mrs.
Bonython, who was a daughter of late-Speaker Bray,
died some years ago ; so a sister will act as hostess.
Steeplechase day (Saturday) began in a steady drizzle ;
but, as the clouds lifted and cloaks were dispensed with,
some attractive raiment, mostly of the coat-and-skirt
order, came to light. The tailor-built costume is the
most appropriate one for the female who takes racing
seriously. It is impossible to chase “information,” in-
terview' the tote, or view' the paddock comfortably in
chiffons.
Our Wattle Day League met in conference the other
day, and decided to voice a protest against South
Africa’s adoption of the wattle as its emblem in the
Coronation fripperies. The idea is that the new Union
ought to raise an emblem of its own—a manacled Chow,
or Hebrew bediamonded on a field of lucre or something
appropriate like that. Interest in the W. D. League is
spreading here, and the committee talks hopefully of the
time when Wattle Day will be as much an institution as
Maple Day in Canada.
A recent official inspection of those places (or some of
them) where we get our bread and meat disclosed a grim
state of things. Several of them were termed “revolting,”
and the dailies supplied a column of ghastly details con-
cerning dirt and flies. The revelations were enough to
make housewives bake their own bread and go meatless,
till they are assured that ourstringent Foods Act has jus-
tified itself.
This week-end sees us very busy with Governors. The
coming and departing vice-regalities of Victoria meet at
the local Government House, etiquette forbidding them
to do so in Victoria.
A recent departer for realms unknown was popular
“ Jim ” Dick, one of the original 53 members of the Stock
Exchange in ’B7, and a familiar figure in racing and
mining circles. He died on Saturday, and the news,
drifting out to the races, cast a gloom over the function.
I hinted last week that the Glenelg train was the most
deliberate on earth. Not so, however. The Gawler to
Angaston railway, it appears, conveys passengers a dis-
tance of 20 odd miles in something over two hours. One
merit the service possesses—it never has serious
accidents. . . _ „
Changes are foreshadowed in the constitution of the
Queen Adelaide Club. At present it is a proprietary con-
cern, and the members are being asked to take it over.
As its soundness as a financial venture; has been practi-
cally proved, they should be willing enough to do so.
Mrs. Box, the present secretary, will continue to act for
a reasonable period, in the event of the proposal going
through.
The hunting season officially opens to-day with a
shortish run, followed by tea at The Kennels. Mr. Willie
Pope, who has been in this village as l«ng as present day
huntsmen .can remember, ,is the Hunt Club’s new
president.
Mrs. Davies Thomas delighted nine debutantes and a
host of others by her hall the other night. The affair was
a huge success, and, for a wonder, the hostess secured a
sufficiency of dancing men.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.
Though the Federal legislator has little
honor in his own country, he sometimes gets
it from other countries. Lately London
Leather Journal poured much butter up-
on Australia’s Commerce Act, that piece
of gross interference with Private Enter-
prise which Fat averred would drive capi-
tal out of the country. The trade journal
openly praised the Act as a wise and states-
manlike measure, and said “that it had al-
ready had the effect of lifting Australian
leather to a higher plane than imports from
, other, countries.”
Died near Edithburgh (S.A.), lately,
Robert Caldwell, the father of the late
politician-poet. When he was 90 he employed a
man to help him dig a well. The man let the
empty bucket fall on his head. Old Caldwell was
up to the surface like greased lightning, and giving
his assistant the sack. After that he dug wells
without any assistance—the last only a year ago,
when he was a youngster of 96.
N.S.W. Chief Secretary Donald Mac-
donell is among the few who have been able to
read notices of their own death. In fact, he can
also read a resolution expressing regret at the
untimely occurrence, passed by the Albury muni-
pal council. Almost ever since the Labor Minis-
try was formed the strong man of theA.W.U.
has been physically a very sick man ; and, though
he has improved a trifle lately, his condition is
still serious.
George Hunt, whose name was on a
Rundle-street (Adelaide) shop for over 40 years,
was buried the other day. He made a fortune
out of Broken Hill speculations, and retired from
business when he was little more than 50. He
ended his days at 65. The business man who
quits the office for the lap of luxury too soon is
apt to fall early before the Scythe. Seedsman
Hackett, in business almost opposite Hunt’s old
shop, and reputedly the richest man in Rundle-
street, still serves over his own counter. As he
isn’t 90 yet, he hasn’t so far thought about
retiring.
Regarding the late James Graham Dick/1
of Adelaide: —
“ Jim ’.’ Pick, one of the original 55 members of the,
Adelaide' Stock Exchange, was an anti-Wowser and a
Clhristian. He wis a wealthy man at the time of the
Broken Hill boom, and might have been at his death if
he had not chosen to let an ignorant public.keep its own
money. Dick would have nothing to do with company
promoting, although he was a great gambler. He once
tossed a racing club secretary for £louo and won. The
loser thereupon regarded the whole transaction asa joke,
and the sharebroker thereafter, regarded him with as
much contempt as he was capable of expressing. Years
ago his friend. Oxenham, commissioned.him to quietly
get as much money on a certain racehorse as possible.
Dick met some bosom pals, celebrated the reunion with
much pomp, and forgot all about the matter till after the
race. The horse lost. Dick gave a much-astonished
Oxenham his money back. As a matter of fact, he would
have paid him his total winnings (or what they should
have been) if the horse bad won. Years ago he had
trouble over a share transaction on account of a tele-
phone message being wrongly delivered. He swore he
would never use the instrument again, and kept his
word. A great racing man, he once left the course indig-
nant at the blindness of the stewards over what he con-
sidered foul riding, and sent each of them a pair of
spectacles. His big felt hats, his massive stick and
signet ring, and his woefully loose and comfortable
clothes (always the same cut and color) were part and
parcel of the city for years. Yet, though he cut a queer
figure, bg was sensitive about any remark regarding his
appearance. When the Exchange was in King William-
streer,, Ivan Henry exclaimed one day: “Hello! Look
at Jim Dick’s new hat! ” Presently, when Henry ap-
peared wearing a new top-hnt; Dick threw it on the ground
and jumped on it, exclaiming: “Look at Ivan Henry’s
new hat ! ” Ivan Henry didn't see the joke, and Bed-
dome, P.M., fined the joker £lO. Some of his jests were
better than 'bat. When the 1 Register was conducting
an inane plebiscite regarding the 10 best carnations, the
ponderous sharebroker compiled a list of the nicknames
of himself and cronies. It was signed “A. B. Gardener,”
and was printed without a smile. He was a fine fellow,
who scorned untruths, and by this time he and G.
Washington are bound to be great friends.

Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy for children. It is ab-
solutely the best I have used in my professional
career, extending over 20 years. Numerous cases of
croup, which is a most dreadful complaint for
children, have come under my notice, and I never

for it means absolutely the end of the disease after

STRICKEN BY
SCIATICA.
♦— ——
Australian Athlete who had to
Give up Sport.
Suffered off and on for ten years
Cured by
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.
* l 4.
A few years ago there were few better
known athletes in Tasmania than Mr. Arthur
J. Grice, of Driflield Street, Queenstown,
whose performances on the cinder track and
football field won for him a place in the front
rank. After a time, however, Mr. Grice
disappeared from active competition, and it
was learned that this was due to recurring
attacks of Sciatica. After suffering off and
on for a number of years, Mr. Grice is
hearty and strong again, and he thanks Dr,
, Williams’ Pink Pills for completely curing
his Sciatica. He said :
“Up to the age of 23 years I was always
strong and healthy, and a well-known ath-
lete. From that time forward I was cotn-
pelled to give up all sport, such as running,
football, etc., owing to repeated attacks of
Sciatica in the right hip, and extending to
the right knee. I consulted several doctors
who prescribed for me some medicine to take,
others blistering me and giving me lotions.
The blistering was so severe that it took
all the skin off rhy hip to my knee/ THfe
pain at times was Well-nigh unbearable. It
was very sharp like needles being pushed
into the flesh. It used to be worse at night,
especially if I got wet or had been working
in water. The Sciatic nerve was very ten-
der to the touch. The attack used to vary,
sometimes lasting for a week or more, and at
other times for a day or so. It was always
- a burning pain; walking would irritate it.
The muscles wasted away. I had been in
this state for about 10 years, and whenever it
came on I used to consult the doctors, but
without receiving permanent relief, and had
come to the conclusion that it would come
and go whenever it liked. Eventually a fel-
low workman, who had been cured of Sciatica
after being bedridden for three weeks, ad-
vised me to give Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills a
trial, as they had cured him. I got a box
and benefited so much from their use I
kept on with them, and by the time I had
taken four boxes I felt completely cured.
That is nearly two years since, and I am
happy to say I have never had a twinge or
any sign of the complaint since, and I can
conscientiously, recommend Dr. Williams -
Pink Pills to anyone suffering as I did or
from any other complaint arising from a
disorder of the blood, as I have known sev-
eral who have benefited by their use.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
When the N.S.W. Government accepted
Gregory Wade’s amendment to the Gover-
nor’s speech as a want of confidence motion,
there were 47 questions on the business
paper. Of these 30 were credited to that
eminent flautist, J. C. L. Fitzparrot. The
remaining 17 were divided amongst the
other 89 members.
Comm rce fakes even the Census these
days. In England it is recorded that the
Cheltenham brew’ers were bent upon keep-
ing the town below 50,000, because, if the
count went above that, it would raise license
duties under the Budget by £lOOO a year; so
some breweries paid . the expenses of em-
ployees, wives and children for a week-end
holiday elsewhere.
The N. S. Wales Government proposes to
bring in a bill to amalgamate the two Sav-
ings Banks, in order to cut expense; and
Vested Interests raises the expected cry
that if the “healthy rivalry” is stopped, the
banks won’t push their business, and so
there won’t be as much thrift. Unfortu-
nately for that yarn, N. S. Wales, with the
“healthy rivalry” thrown in, has only 281
depositors per 1000 people, while Victoria,
which sof’e years ago pooh-poohed the same
yarn, and amalgamated its two banks, has
429 depositors per 1000 of its population.
In fact, barring Queensland, there are in
proportion to population fewer Savings Bank
depositors in the Ma State than in any other
part of the Commonwealth. Either, then,
the Ma Staters are naturally a thriftless
lot, or the “healthy rivalry” has the very
opposite effect to that claimed for it.
“Firing-line”: Just after I had read a
pathetic lament in the Age about the impos-
bility of Australia being able to afford the
money necessary for the Henderson defence
scheme, I came across the following:—
Frederick William of Prussia, the “Great Elector,”
who reigned from 1640 to 1688, . . . left 36 bat-
talions of infantry, 40 squadrons of cavalry, 2700
garrison troops, a model artillery, well-filled stores,
and —a population of 1,W0,000, with a territory of
1/5,000 square miles.
That was the real beginning of what is now
the great German nation. After reading
this, I began to wonder what sort of an army
and navy Frederick would have had in Aus-
tralia now, had he been here. Also, I won-
dered what he would have done with the
pusillanimous Age.
THE LAST RESOURCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From a very careful study of the leader-writing clan,
And the leaders that they write,
I judge that editors possess a systematic plan
For use at night.
Whenever themes run short they call their minions
of the pen
(Mr Snooks or Mr. Stiggins),
And they murmur: “Printer’s growling; it’s already
ha’-past ten—
Git on to Higgins.”
When the Kaiser’s disappointing, and the House of
Lords is slack,
And the Mexicans won’t rally,
Yet the printer is insatiable, the editors fall back
On King O’Malley. '
But even he and Billy Hughes will not suffice for
long
To choke off agitation,
And so we have the thesis on the Sin and Shame
and Wrong
Of Arbitration.
Alas, these Daily Thunderers! they flounder to and
fro
Through Dreadnoughts, docks, destroyers,
State coal mines, socialis' c strikes and other themes
of woe
To poor employers,
Church union, Fisher’s navy schemes (a fearful dia-
tribe!)
Divorce laws (for the ladies) ;
But when all subjects fail them, then they bid the
anxious scribe
Give Higgins Hades!

A SIMPLE PRESCRIPTION.
SAID TO CURE RHEUMATISM, KIDNEY TROURLE
AND BLADDER TROUBLES.
We know that the readers of this paper
appreciate good advice, and we are glad,
therefore, to be able to publish the following
from a prominent physician.
It is astonishing to know the prevalence
of kidney trouble and other diseases, such as
rheumatism, bladder and liver troubles, which
are almost invariably caused by weak kid-
neys.
The least symptom of kidney trouble, such
as backache, must be given prompt atten-
tion, and a good reliable treatment should be
taken, until every trace of the disease has
been eliminated. We are glad to be able
to give our readers a prescription which we
have seldom known to fail in any case. It
contains no harmful ingredients, is pleasant
to take, not expensive, and can be supplied
by any good chemist. It is as follows :
Tincture Gentian Compound, one ounce;
Syrup Rhubarb, one ounce; Liquid Barkola
Compound, one ounce ; Syrup of Ginger, five
ounces.
Take a teaspoonful after each meal, and
one at bed-time.
If taken continuously for a few weeks, it
will be found to be an almost absolutely cer-
tain cure for Rheumatism, Kidney and Blad-
der trouble, Backache and all allied com-
plaints.*
The Felton Estate, Darling Downs, Queensland,
for 25 years the home of the late Hon. J. Tyson,
M.L.C., has at last come into the market for sub-
divisional purposes, and is now cut up in farming
areas, and is to be offered at auction, on Thursday,
June 29, at Cambooya, Queensland. Quite the feature
of the sale is the remarkably liberal and easy terms
that are being offered, which should bring this very
fine property within reach of most of our farmers
and their sons. 15 p.c. deposit, and nothing more
(except interest half-yearly at 5 p.c.) for 10 years at
buyers’ option. At the end of 10 years further time
can be got if arranged for at the sale. An adver-
tisement can be seen in our columns, and the auc-
tioneers are The Australian Estates and Mortgage
Company, Limited, Brisbane.*
There are not many things for which your
true, all-wool Anti-Sosher isn’t prepared to
loaf on the State. The other day Dr. Bur-
nett ITam, Victoria’s Chief Health Officer,
mentioned that his department was breeding
a number of special rat-catching cats, and
the remark bl’ought such a shoal "of applica-
tions for the beasts that Ham was nearly
compressed into meat-extract. It is so
much easier and more profitable for Anti-
Sosh to loaf on the State for a cat, than to
pull down all its uninhabitable rookeries,
abolish its tips, remove its boildowmeries, its
abattoirs and its other rat-nurseries, and
keep itself properly clean.
New rolls will be used for the next Vic-
torian elections, which are expected to take
place in November. Until this year, the
lists were formed by copying the ratepayers’
municipal rolls, and adding those electors
who registered personally. Comparatively
few non-ratepayers registered, so practically
every election was decided by the ratepayers.
The new rolls have been compiled, like the
Federal rolls, on a house-to-house canvass ;
and the result is a tremendous addition of
about 150,000 new names. Some of the
constituencies show jumps like this :
Old Roll. New Roll. Increase.
Brunswick . . . . 10,988 17,286 6,298
Hawthorn .. . . 14,086 20,666 6,480
St. Hilda . . . . 11,065 19,411 8,346
Mornington . . 6,903 12,310 5,407
Lowan 5,052 8,787 3,735
Rodney 6,090 8,865 2,776
As every Propputy vote was previously en-
rolled, it seems pretty certain that the vast
majority of the new 150,000 votes will be
thrown on the other side; wherefore the Tory
papers can already hear a sickening thud in
the distance, and in desperation they are
suggesting that John Weary should stay in
England and let the more energetic Watt
try to dodge the trouble.
MORE SO CIALISTIC LEGISLATION.
“ These props used, to be 6d.! Now you charge is.”
"Me come under purry carpehters Wages Board, missus.”
The “seething discontent” in the Postal
Service went off the boil, as far as the news-
papers are concerned, directly the Referen-
dum vote was taken. Up to that time there
was about a daily column of matter in the
press, dealing with the discontent of the
postal employees on account of grievances
caused by Federal mismanagement, and the
matter was quoted wholesale by the pained
and bleeding Noses. Since April 26, how-
ever, a supreme content seems to have seized
the postal servants. In fact, statements
have appeared showing how vastly their con-
ditions have improved since the Labor Gov-
ernment climbed into power—how the wages
have been improved, and the number of peo-
ple who secured their due leave in 1910 was
double that of the happy leave-takers in 1909.
In fact, postal discontent through the Com-
monwealth’s niggardliness having outlived its
usefulness, the State Frighters plainly be-
gin to get ready to make capital out of an
alleged public discontent through the Com-
monwealth’s extravagance.
The Maoriland Worker, the official organ
of the M.L. Federation of Labor, in a refer-
ence to objections forwarded to the Austra-
lian compulsory military training system,
quotes the case of a woman who refused to
“hand over her son’s future to any set of
capitalistic political yahoos,” and says:
“Will Maoriland mothers please copy?”
The Worker doesn’t tell the M.L. mother
what she is to say when the war-maddened
enemy climbs over the wall and starts in to
sack the place. Probably the Worker
might invite the furious person into a pub
and suggest that he should get work, instead
of being the foe of progress and the diabolical
handmaiden of capitalistic carnivora. If he
doesn’t agree to tnSt; apparently he’ll just
have to do his worst.
A large section of N.S.W. Labor has come
to the conclusion that the old ship Organisa-
tion has accumulated a lot of barnacles and
needs to be docked. A special conference
of the P.L.L. is to be held to consider mat-
ters "on the political side; and the Labor
Council is exercising its mind over indus-
trial organisation. The conflict between
Industrial and Sectional Unionism is what
is mainly concerning the Labor Council-, the
conflict between unions over the scope of
their organisation work- having become in-
tense. The Labor Council favors sectional
unions, federated on “trade” lines; but there
are a number of vigorous exponents of an
idea that there should be just one central
authority to which all fees should be pay-
able, the members being split into various
sections for industrial purposes, but remain-
ing integral parts of the central body.
Customs Minister Tudor has an atrocious
memory. A while ago Australian butter
began to get a speckled name in England,
because some shippers persisted in selling
water instead of fat. So Tudor dropped in
with a Trade regulation prohibiting the ex-
port of butter containing more than 14 per
cent, moisture. ' The get-rich-quick-and-
damn-the-future exporter went howling to
him that the thing was impossible—they
couldn’t possibly get the moisture down to
that. Whereupon the Minister with the
atrocious memory refused to forget that,
back in 1806, before this sort of adultera-
tion had been thought necessary, Pearson,
the Victorian Government Analyst, had
tested samples from the 47 butter. factories
then existing, and had found that, in the
very worst case, there was 14.64 per cent,
of moisture, in the best case 7.44 per cent.,
and on the average only 11.13 per cent.
When Morgan, the British Trade Com-
missioner, was in these parts, he told Aus-
tralia that it was about time it woke up
and kicked the shipping ring which controls
.( freights between the two ends of the earth.
Australia, however* merely turned over in
its sleep and asked “What’s the odds?”
Since then the ring has bumped up the
wheat freights, and the vast majority of the
farmers, though they know that they are
getting less for their crops* still don’t realise
what has hit them. Now the Melbourne
crowd which bought the Papanui and patched
her begins to feel the same fist—only it is
choking. instead of hitting them. The,
Papanui, having got cargo from Australia,
set to work to get some back-loading, but
found out that nobody would consign. If
a shipper dared to give any loading outside
the ring, the ring would frankly charge him
a crushing price for every other bit of load-
ing. “Very well,” said the Papanui, “we’ll
buy a cargo of cement, and sell it here.” But
now they mournfully announce that the ce-
ment manufacturers won’t sell a cargo to
them; so they are up against a dead wall.
And that’s the sort of little party that the
people the other day decided could be quite
effectively handled by a midget State—like
Tasmania, for example.
“Niser Orga,” from the North: —
“Tlje task tnat faces the Nationalist is mainly
educative” (B. 6/4/’ll). And it’s a big enough job
for any giant. At present the disposition of the
ignorant brand of cocky is to put every trouble
down to the Labor crowd. Here’s a ease not a
month old. A sugar cocky had just received word
from the State income-tax authorities. They cour-
teously informed him that they had reason to believe
that lie had understated his income by at least £2OO,
and requested an explanation. Thereupon an explod-
ing cocky rushed up' to a couple of well-known
Laborites with the offending document. “There’s
your Labor party for you ! Reckon they know
more- ’n I ,d° about my -— — income. Give them more
power ? - Not if I can help it, the blanks.” This
occurred in Queensland ; and, although Denham and
his crowd have been called many hard names, 1
don’t think anyone has gone to the extreme of call-
ing them Labor.
Archibald R. Colquhoun, the British naval au-
thority, lectured before the Royal United Ser-
vice Institution, in the Cold Country, last
mouth, on “Sea Power in the Pacific.” He
tfilked about the Australian fleet, and found
its most useful strategic base —where? Syd-
ney? Melbourne? No! “Port Darwin ap-
pears to possess the qualifications needed for
the. purpose.” Colquhoun said other things
which proved that the Imperialist in Britain
isn’t the one-eyed truckler that he usually is
in Australia—as, for example, when he
scorned the idea of an Imperial scheme of
defence “in which Germany is regarded as the
only possible enemy, and which concentrates
the naval force of the Empire in the North
Sea.”
This time it is her own correspondent in
New York who urges the S. M. Herald to
get up to date. Writing to the old dame an
article on the American political situation,
and particularly as to the prospects of the
Democratic party roping in Roosevelt, lie
says that the Constitution has been out-
grown, and—-
To be progressive means the shelving of many of
its older leaders, and the abandonment of the abso-
lute supremacy of the sovereign rights of the several
States and other like moribund doctrines.
If one of “Mr. James’s” young men had pro-
duced a statement, prior to the taking of
the Nose Referenda, that State Frights was
“a moribund doctrine,” he’d never have for-
gotten it. Perhaps he might never even have
recovered consciousness.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
League Rugby was strenuous in Sydney
on Saturday, in spite of the recent punishment dealt
out by the Council. There was just as much stoush
roaming about as ever, and Authority will have to
come down with a heavier fist on those players whom
the referees order off for violent conduct. On Sat-
urday no less than four savages were caught, and
sent into retirement. Besides these a number es-
caped detection owing to the fact that even a referee
can See only one way at once. Eastern Suburbs
was in distress, and its position was not improved
when one of its players was sent to the dressing-
loom owing to foul play. The fact that the loss
was shortly afterwards evened up by the departure
of a Newtown ruffian should not make the club feel
any better. Had Eastern Suburbs not offended it
would have had a man to the good at the finish, and
the Cord knows it wanted about two. Annandale
team also had to play a man short owing to the
same thing, and so had Western Suburbs. It is
t.me the clubs looked at it in this light, instead of
regarding the sniiters as heroes.
Somewhere about 15,000 frenzied barrackers
turned out to see Eastern Suburbs go down be-
fore the onslaught of Newtown, the premier club. Both
sides hung back for the final struggle. With the
opening of the second half Newtown back brigade
got moving in splendid style, and fairly effervesced.
Cross kicking from wing to centre was done with
accuracy and judgment, and that it was deliberately
planned was evident from the way the team watched
and played for it. And the final scores, 16 to seven,
proved the wisdom of playing according to a con-
certed plan. The trouble with the rank and file
of Eastern Suburbs is that every man jack wants
to out-Messenger himself; but one Messenger in a
team is quite enough, and till E. S. realises that fact
it will continue to be a chopping block. At Birch-
grove Glebe trampled on Balmain, the Tattered Sub-
urb being downed by 19 to eight. When properly
wound up the back division of South Sydney proved
too strong for Annandale, scoring, apparently, when
it liked. It was satisfied with 30 to 11, and of that
11 no less than eight were due to the hoof of one
Green, about whose kicking there is nothing verdant.
Western Suburbs, braced up by the sea voyage to
North Sydney, were in great fettle, and downed
the hillmen of the North bv 14 to 13, which was
mighty close.
* * * *
In the dawn of the season a Rugby
Union official proudly announced that the Union
would play football for its own sake, regardless of
whether the public attended or not. So the em-
phatic non-attendance of the public presumably
doesn’t worry the Union. At University Oval New-
town and Balmain went through a sort of cat and
mouse performance, Newtown being the cat. Its
margin was 21 points. The University fell on Glebe
and, by better discipline, beat it by 25 to 15. But
Glebe was a mob, not a team. Eastern Suburbs
mopped up St. George with one to spare, and Manly
obliterated South Svdnev bv eight to seven. Western
Suburbs managed to squeeze six on to the board
against North Sydney’s four.
In the Union competition University and
Newtown are easily best; both have won all three
matches played, which means six points each.
Western Suburbs, last year a very weak crowd, is a
good runner-up with five; then Glebe and Eastern
Suburbs, four each; Manly three, and Balmain two.
South Sydney, North Sydney and St. George have
distinguished themselves by losing every match.
* * * *
Only one of Saturday’s Vic. League games
promised much sport, that between Essendon and
Collingwood, wrtiich was expected to be something
extra. So. in spite of threatening weather, 20,000
swarmed into East Mell). ground and saw some
choice hoofball, clean handling, accurate passing,
brilliant marking and gorgeous kicking. The draw-
back was that it was all on ’Don’s s de. After a first
demonstration of what it could do, the Magpie crowd
seemed to absolutely forget all it knew, and, whereas
’Don could do nothing wrong, ’Wood could do no-
thing right. Resuming after half-time, with 29
points to “the Same Old’s” 52, the premier team
made a strenuous effort; but it was countered and
then the game became a rout. When the bell and
darkness ended the debacle, few were sorry. The
record —Essendon 138 points, Collingwood 53 —must
be avenged to be forgotten. Carlton-’Varsity scuffle
was a ructious, willing episode, throughout which the
students led, only to be beaten at the close. Carl-
ton ran up three goals in as many minutes, and the
day ended with Carlton’s 65 to Uni’s 44. The Saints
went all the way to Eitzroy, apparently in order to
give the Maroons a few hours’ em'ovment, and
finished a ghastly afternoon with 30 points to ’Roy’s
82. A similar piece of humor transpired at South
Melbourne, where Skinner’s, hirelings casually raked
in 85 points to. Melbourne’s 59. Richmond visited
Geelong, and pegged point for point till lemon-time,
when Geelong collected 13 points extra, and won by
60 to 47. Geelong regarded it as a famous victory.
The increase of attendance at the Asso-
ciation’s matches is probably due more to the ab-
sence of surprising reversals than anything else. A
crowd that can stand a surprise objects to that sort
of thing being sprung too often. F’rinstance, the
6000 that watched P’ran argue the point with Ports
wouldn’t bet more than even money either way, and
when P’ran scored its fourth successive victory with
54 points to 51, the crowd felt it had received a fair
game for its money. Similarly, the uncertainty as
to the superiority of Essendon over Footscray kept
some 5000 barrackers on tenterhooks till the' scorer
said—Essendon 49 points, ’Scray 41. Another thing
counted as righteousness to the Association is the
absence of rough play. Although the season is but
four weeks old, and there have been no notably
brutal exhibitions, over a store of League men are
down with injuries, and two of them are never likely
to play again. On Saturday the casualty list ran —
Collingwood, three men laid out (one unconscious) ;
Carlton, one; ’Varsity, one; and a number of minor
smashes which did not result in any departures from
the ranks. The roughness isn’t apparent in the
League games, but it happens, and in the Association
matches it doesn’t.
Those innocents who opined that the
League’s declaration in favor of open professionalism
would clear the Melbourne football atmosphere are
beginning to feel anxious, as the clubs seem to be in
more trouble than ever. Some reckless committee-
men demanded that written statements of the sums
paid to the players should be laid on the table,
and when this was done the grease got into the con-
flagration. One ’bailer was getting £7 per week,
covering everything, and he didn’t care whence it
came, or how little the others got; that was his
price by agreement. But his mates collecting £1
and £ 2 per week apiece are naturally demanding
“Whaffor?” Another luminary insisted on £4 per
week and his fare. And as no club can pay these
rates all round, internal dissension is looming big.
The progress of the League’s Essendon
team will be interesting to watch this year by rea-
son of the fact that Johnny Worrall is training it.
IV orrall is by way of being a wizard as a trainer.
Years ago he played forward and coached Fitzroy,
and 'Rov stayed at the top of the tree for seven
years. That was in the days when Worrall played cric-
ket for Carlton, and made 417 n.o. He transferred his
services and advice to P’ran, or Hawksburn as it
was then, and Hawksburn speedilv arrived, and (as
P’ran) flies the pennant to-day. 'After that Worrall
started to coach Carlton in ’oofball, and from the
bottom of the list that club speedily rose and
reached the top in four years. It stayed there
three seasons; then it sacked Worrall, and now it
falls back. This year he is training Essendon, and
that team, fourth last year and the year before,
threatens to arrive this year or the next. The
trouble is that his autocratic manner, though it
makes him a good trainer, also makes him unpopu-
lar, till in time the wearied plavers rebel, and
•lohnny Worrall becomes Johnny Walker.
“ FOOTBALL ” TRAINING.
As the Government has commandeered
the Agricultural Ground (Sydney) for the display on
Coronation Day, it is securing the Cricket Ground
for the League to play on. The Rugby Union has
tiie sole right to use the Cricket Ground for football
from May 11 till September 10, arid is loudly ask-
ing where it comes in, and is threatening to kick.
The Government, it seems, has the right to take the
Cricket Ground any time it wants it. and it is under-
stood that it proposes to exercise that right; but as
the ground is not suitable for its purpose it will ex-
change with the League for that day. So it is hard
to see how the Union can kick effectively.
* * * *
Sydney damsels who admire physical cul-
ture have found a new and delightful pastime. The
bailers train at the Sports Ground two nights a
week, and, as the place is brilliantly illuminated,
the female votaries of Apollo Belvidere can see the
show from some rocks which overlook the ground.
Those rocks are crowded at nights when training is
on. The scene inside the ground might have been
lifted bodily from the days of Pagan Rome, when
the gladiators got ready for the arena displays.
Under the flaring lights semi-nude men indulge in
all sorts of exercises, and are rubbed down in a
still nearer approach to the altogether, while a vouth
runs round serving out small pieces of raw steak,
which the savages chew. It is a sight calculated
to drive Judkins to suicide and send Norman Lindsay
into ecstasies.
* * * *
Richard Arnst must have been well-nigh
knocked off his perch last week when the cable whis-
pered that the backers of Barry had agreed to put
up the £750 that he demanded to go to England
and race Barry on the Thames. Probably the
Englishmen saw in the exorbitant demand a desire
to choke Barry off, and reckoned that a man like
Arnst could have only one reason for choking any
man off. So they put up the stuff eagerly when
they thought they saw a chance of taking the title
bacit to Fogland. Barry desires to row in gloomy
December, and after the English have met Arnst’s
demands for a young mountain of gold the Maori-
lander can hardly do otherwise than agree. Alto-
gether it looks as though the astute one has rather
fallen in, though if he can down Pearce and wallop
Barry he will still come through with his colors up
and his bugle blowing. But the Lord have mercy
on him if he is defeated !
* * * *
On a recent afternoon a Maoriland liner
arrived in Sydney with Dick Arnst’s £5OO stake for
the match with Pearce. Arnst is said to be anxious
to find if he has property recovered from
his recent illness before signing the articles to row
on a fixed date. He gives Pearce credit for being a
formidable opponent, and unless he is sure that he
will be in the best of condition on the day of the race
as at present understood, that day will have to be
shoved forward. Pearce, on the other hand, being
now in the pink of condition, will probably go stale
if the date is pushed on by very much. And, as
usual, there are those who see in the straightforward
and complimentary talk of Richard a confession of
fear or a desire to postpone the race till Pearce is
stale. It’s a bad world.
* * * *
The fact that the opening run of the
N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union drew over 700 riders into its
comet-like tail suggests that the amateur body has a
mighty membership. Last year it reached 1412, and
it is understood that the numbers for the present
year will beat all records. As the body has a credit
balance of £l2B with which to start its new term,
it is evidently a very healthy body indeed.
* " * * *
N.S.W. Motor Cycling Club is about to
offer a gold medal for a record continuous ride be-
tween Melbourne and Sydney, a distance of 575
miles. An annuity or invalidity pension would seem
a more appropriate prize, for the jarring of a con-
tinuous ride over 575 miles of roads like those be-
tween Melbourne and Sydney is calculated to break
up the strongest human animal that at present goes
on two legs, let alone a wheel. Only one man has
attempted the job, and he failed and got smashed in-
to the bargain. Practically it means a 25 hours’
ride, and it’s too much to ask the body to do unless
it is necessary. At present it isn’t.
F. T. Keefe, the Tasmanian cyclist who
in January broke the Yankee record for 100 Miles
Unpaced Road riding at Los Angeles, in California,
has been notified by the ruling body that the record
is accepted. This ride was an effort to capture the
£2O offered by the Dunlop Co. to the Australasian
cyclist who can beat Leon Meredith’s 4hr. 52min.
51 4-ssec. Keefe's shr. 2min. is the best so far,
and it is claimed that it embraces the Yankee re-
cords of the 25, 50 and 75 miles.
* * * *
The unpleasantness in Mexico is worrying
Yankee fight promoters. The downfall of Jeffries set
loose a wave of dislike
for the bruising busi-
ness in the States, and
more than one big gun
declared that the sign
of the times was that
the Jeffries - Johnson
scrap would be the
last big one on Yan-
kee soil. Fight pro-
moters apparently
thought so, too; and,
immediately fixing
upon Mexico as a good
convincing ground,
they rushed to secure
good sites in border
towns, where Yankee
fight followers could
come quickly by train
and find suitable ac-
commodation. But the
upheaval of Madero
has upset the idea, and
now it seems that the
world’s biggest fights will take place in stay Paree.
* * * *
There are threats of a Birtles-White con-
troversy- between the admirers of the two cyclists.
Neither of the principals has time to waste on
argument, but tne country seems full of gentlemen
who will do it for them. The Birtles crowd points
out that White had pacing assistance over 1100 miles
(from Adelaide to Sydney), while Birtles had none.
But the other side urges that Birtles knew the way,
while White went astray repeatedly, and was oc-
casionally put off the right track by hoodlums. Then
it is mentioned that Birtles had just recovered from
an attack of fever when he left Fremantle, and, any-
how, was stale from his 10,500-mile sprint round
Australia. But this sort of yapping is folly. In
dealing with big events like this, details have to be
left out. Success or failure are the only things that
count, and just now White has the success.,

Joseph Davis, who collapsed and died sud-
denly after a game of bowls at Marrickville (Syd-
ney, last week, was 30 years ago a cricketer of re-
nown, and held a place in the' N.S.W. XI. After
taking to bowls he still followed his old game with
interest, and philanthropy and hospitality gild his
memory in the recollections of cricketers.

Canterbury Jockey Club (M.L.) has just
ended a season of financial record. Eleven days’
racing saw £30,880 distributed among horse-
owners, and £200,659 put through the Tote. The
amount put through the machine was an increase of
£24,000 on the previous season’s figures. The all-
round increase in Maoriland Tote investments of
late suggests that the country is either mighty pros-
perous, or going to the dogs with a superlative
rush.
* * * *
S.A. Jockey Club paid out £5347 in stakes
on its three days’ Adelaide Cup meeting. Eye-glass
gave E. E. D. Clarke the biggest cheque, £1035;
then came J. James, Rupert Clarke, and J. “Rowen.”
Vic. owners took about half the total. The totalisa-
tor put through just on £54,000 —-easily a record.
The club gets in commission £4050, a nice help to-
wards the stake-money, which is accordingly to be
raised all round next,season. And the Verran Gov-
ernment, which mostly hates and denounces the
tote, accepts the little solatium of £1350.
* * * *
Papa Levien, of N.S.W. State Assembly,
has once more got his perennial Totalisator Bill on
the business-paper. The announcement was greeted
with loud guffaws from a number of members, who
evidently regard it as a joke. But there are ominous
whispers and nodding of heads, which are keeping
Christian Noses and Paddy Bagman awake at nights.
For the first time in its long life, the Bill has a
chance of becoming the Act. Wherefore there is
gnashing of teeth and bad language in some elegant
homes where pencillers dwell.
Newcastle Cup on Saturday last was a
boil-over. The distance is 11 furlongs, and Patrick
Noses was in great fettle, cheerfully laying 33 to one
and worse against Strathroyle, with 6st. 91b. up.
The lightweight won from those other outsiders,
Flava (15 to one against) and Brackenburg (2.0 to
one against). But that is not quite correct; what is
meant is that Christian offered these prices, but
found no takers. Fools and their money are easily
parted.
Brisbane is likely to see a rush for the
world’s 440 yards professional championship, as W.
F. Trembath, of Maoriland, is on the trail of Arthur
Postle, with a defiance backed by 50 of the best.
Trembath is a formidable opponent, who, in 40 half-
mile spins, has been unplaced in only one, and has
generally shown a very pretty turn of speed. That
sort of new comer is always dangerous to a veteran.
Brisbane will probably see the race in about a
month, after which Trembath will away to Britain
in search of records and money.

The N.S.W. bowlers who rejected the pro-
posal of the executive to appoint a paid secretary
are a curious lot. They are mostly decent fellows
who would be shot rather than sponge on any man
for a drink, but they have no objection to sponging
on a few enthusiastic members for secretarial work,
the management of inter-State tournaments, the ar-
rangement of the Australian conference recently held
in Sydney, etc. There have been teams from
Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, Maoriland and Bal-
larat, and they have all had to be looked after.
Which means that, altogether apart from money ex-
pended, somebody has had to do a lot of hard work,
and probably shell out a goodly sum for assistance.
The argument against the proposal is that, as only
about 5 per cent, of the members take part in the
inter-State tournaments, and the other 95 per cent,
have no say in such contests, and do not desire them,
therefore it is up to the 5 per cent, that have the
fun to pay for it. But if that is the attitude,
somebody should move that a ballot be taken as to
whether inter-State tournaments should be discon-
tinued, and the executive instructed to stick to
Pennant fixtures and local games only. It ,
question is put that way to the Association (ana it
is the only fair way to put it), there is little doubt
but that it will be thrown out on its little pmk ear.
“Bill” Lang did not contract modesty in
an acute form while abroad, judging by his treat-
ment of Lester when the latter proposed a return
scrap. He demanded £4OO, win, lose or draw-
one would think he was a champion—and in tha
heat of the moment Lester verbally consented. But
he had forgotten that the Stadium required some-
thing to carry on with, and when he learned that
its share would be 40 per cent, of the gate, he rea-
lised that under those terms he would be buying a
fight with Lang, with no chance of getting anything
out of it but a hiding. So he declined to go on
with the arrangement. Looks as if Mr. Lang doesn t
feel any too sure of his ability to wallop the strip-
ling ; otherwise, why these unreasonable demands.
One of the Wrights has been denouncing
“lightning speeds” in aviation as dangerous. K ®
thinks a nice, easy 60 or 70 miles an hour is a fail
and safe thing. Eighty begins to get risky, 90 is
really dangerous, and over 100 the odds are in
favor of a smash till the machines are made much
stronger. When an aeroplane is scooting at 90
miles an hour, as Verdriue did for the 200 miles
between Poitiers and Paris recently, holes and lumps
in the air are very dangerous. Air becomes as
hard as rock if you strike it with sufficient force,
and when the weak wing of the present aeroplane
hits an aerial boulder, it snaps like a carrot. Of
all the deaths that have happened in aviation during
the last six months, only three were due to faulty
engines coming to a stop. Holes in the air which
caused capsizes, and lumps which smashed the wings
or planes, have accounted for all the rest. *
The chief end of the “stoush” artist is to
keep himself before the public; and, to give him
his due, he generally does it, somehow or other.
After taking a prize for wheat, William Squires felt
a hankering to get back into the public eye, so,
notwithstanding that he has lost several punches, and
likewise fights, he is coming back to the ring. The
coaxing of the gentle spud is to be suspended for a
while, and on August 9 Squires will let loose his
latest-found punch on Bill Lang at Brisbane. It is
as quick a way of raising capital as any, and carries
no interest. The wonder is that William has never
taken to the stage, as he is a first-class humorist.

The wrestler v. boxer barney takes on big
new interest with the announcement that J. Johnson,
the Coon King, declares himself willing to submit a
test case with Clarry Weber, bowing to the limita-
tions imposed by the Melbourne man, with the im-
portant exception of the padded floor. If this is
all a true bill, and not a delusion springing from
the blessed uses of advertisement, the world will
presently be concerned again about the white man’s
bundle.

Melbourne Athletic Club tested Pat Doran
on Bill Walsh the other evening. Doran is a sub-
stantial lad, scaling 13st. and a bit, and is one of
several who are expected to remove the black stain
from the white fellow’s noble art; but on his show-
ing against Walsh—who is 131 b. or 141 b. of solid
fighting material to the bad—that consummation de-
voutly to be wished is a matter of the dim future.
He gets about expertly, and plants his left with speed
and precision when moved to use it, which is not
often, and he defends well. But he is wanting in
vivacity, and too willing to keep out in the open air
when he should be wading in. His right is a dila-
tory weapon, and he mixes awkwardly. However,
he was credited with a points verdict over Walsh,
and is advised to cultivate that invaluable quality in
a boxer —audacity, audacity, and again audacity.
STIFF JOINTS.
From whatever source arising there can be
no greater cause of pain than that inflicted
by Stiff Joints. Like a badly-fitting door,
the bending or straightening of the leg or
arm, or the part affected moves with a jar,
so excruciatingly painful that it is only a
matter of time before the joints become
fixed. Bathing, friction, oils, liniments and
ointments have in thousands of cases proved
utterly unavailing. Stiff Joints that have
resisted all other treatment have -yielded to
the powerful influence of Comstock’s Nerve
and Bone; Liniment. Persevering use of
this Liniment will cause the most stubborn
case to relax.

was for years President of the Leg. Council, and,
falling permanently to sleep, was buried at Bong
Bong, and the members and officials of the House had
this monument put on top of him. Then on into the
church—a quaint old place, worth visiting. It was built
in the era of “assigned servants,” and until recently
there was a gallery, wherein the “ assigned ” and others
of their no-class were expected to worship. When the-
“ assigned ” became memories of the past, the gallery
was converted into an organ loft. The principal window
was put up to the memory of the original Throsby, of
Throsby Park. The old church nowadays stands isolated.
Moss Vale and Bowral have become the centres, leaving
Bong Bong little more than a name.
“ The Colonel ” sends a defiance
Mrs. Piercy, o£ the N.S.W South Coast, can’t have the
honor of having successfully promoted the first women’s
rifle club in Australia (B. 6/4/’ll). Our (Essendon, Vic.)
club was the first in the British Empire, and is still the
mo«t successful ; we call it the Commonwealth Club.
In 1908 we met and defeated a team of officers from the
American fleet, and won by 70 points. In a subsequent
home-and-home match against a team of Sydney ladies,
in charge of Lieut. Dakin, we also won easily. I’ll admit
we don’t fire at 900yds. yet; but at 50yds. and 100yds.
last season Miss Agnes Johnson put up 27 “ bulls ” in
succession (2in. “ bulls ”). And now we’re simply aching
to find out whether the women of the N.S.W. South
Coast can do better; so there’s a home-and-home match
eagerly waiting to be arranged.

THE BEST GUlDE-

for you are then certain
i of obtaining the BEST.

DUNLQR RUBBER CO., All States and N.Z. _
Barracking for a continuance of the iwb-
elasses system on the railways, a Melbohrhe citi-
zen has written to the papers to express the hope
that “until workpeople are compelled to change
their dirty working clothes before travelling in
public conveyances, the injustice of compelling
the clean to travel alongside the dirty in one class
on our railways will never be sanctioned.” The
Classes travel first-class, of course; and of course
they are clean people. The Masses travel second-
class. Some of them may be clean people,
possibly. Some of them are not—just dirty,
common, invaluable dogs who grub in sewers fora
living. Still, it doesn’t matter to the clean rail-
way customer who travels first-class if the clean
second-class customer is “compelled to travel
alongside” the dirty one. Wherefore, hooray for
democracy, and by all means let us have one law
for the clean rich and another for the clean poor !
“ Montalex ” : N.S.W. Chief Justice
Cullen expressed himself recently as being very
solicitous for the strict preservation of the legal
rights of juries. The C.J. hasn’t spoken a
moment too soon. Jury‘•bullying by some Judges
has become a gross abuse, chiefly because of the
jury’s ignorance of its owli judicial status. The
average citizen—and the jury mail is mostly a rtrv
average citizen —is prone to look Upon the jury as
a more or less insignificant factor in the adminis-
tration of justice—entrusted, certainly, with a
nominal power of saying Guilty or Not Guilty,
but otherwise a comparatively negligible accessory
to the magnificence of the upholstered occupant
of the Bench, to say nothing of the other wigs
and gowns, and braid and buttons, and frill and
frippery generally. But in reality the jury is the
central fact of the whole show; for the jury
represents the People —is the People, indeed, in
miniature. The Court is the People’s Court, and
every officer of it, from the Judge on the Bench
to' thei usher sit the door, is the People’s paid ser-
vant. And if the' People* as embodied in the
jury, tamely p'lits tip' vtith insolence from its paid
servant, who' is mlertily there to give it a hand, it
deserves all it gets. At least it would deserve it
if it knew any better.

A CAIRNS
TUNNEL.
MR, DONALD McDONALD (the well-known writer)
describes the trip as follows: —
“ | OR the greater part of the journey on the Queensland coast the steamer runs between the
Great Barrier Reef and the mainland, making it one of the smoothest of the sea trips of Aus-
tralasia. The route is dotted with picturesque islands, covered with foliage strange to
southern eyes, arid the boat is ever rounding headlands, streaming into fine bays and estuaries. The
famous Whitsunday Passage,- between Mackay and Bowen, is extremely picturesque.”
7
CAIRNS
is picturesquely situated, has a health)
climate, and the temperature in winter
seldom falls below 50°. First-class
hotel accommodation at Cairns and
Kuranda (Barron Falls) can be
obtained at a reasonable tariff, and the
fishing at Cairns is excellent. Atrip
to the Barron Falls and gorgeous
scenery about that part .of North
Queensland should not be missed.

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A
1 SMOKE 1 IS TILL YOU'VE
tried MY CIGARS
Oa^r\ t
I’M going to have my Cigars smoked over every
part of Australasia—and the most confirmed
pipe-smokers are going to be the biggest
smokers of my Cigars, too.
Talk about joy! Why, to sit round a camp
fire, over a billy of tea, pitching to your mates,
each of you smoking one of my Cigars, joy isn't
in it! It’s'just simply bliss!
As the yarns go round, the blue smoke
curling upwards in a fragrant cloud, the
smooth cool Havana flavor lingering on your
lips—l tell you, you’ll spend some of the
happiest hours of your life.
Letters are coming in to
me in shoals from all over
Australasia, praising up my
Cigars. Take one I’ve just
got as I write this, for in-
stance —it’s from a chap on a
cattle station up in Northern
Queensland. He writes:—
“Those DIADEMAS Cigars
ofyoursare just alright. I’ve
always smoked a pipe—but
no more. Not that I’ve given
up pipe-smoking altogether;
but when I want a real smoke
—something rich—l light up
one of your DIADEMAS,
and give myself up to its
pure enjoyment.”
To make you acquainted
with my Cigars, and prove
their value, I make you this
FREE OFFER of
5 or 6 CIGARS
you may select.
Send foe 100 of any of
Remit the amount, and
I will deliver promptly,
postage or carriage paid,
to any address in Aus-
tralia.
Smoke 5 or 6 of them, and if they’re
not superior to most Cigars at double the
price, send the remainder back to me, and
I’ll return every penny of your money—no
charge made for the Cigars you’ve smoked.
My Cigars are made from the very finest
mild, rich mellow Tobacco, the filling or inside
heart of the cigar being all straight long
leaf. The Cigars are hand-made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before
it goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed
to burn freely and draw easily.
There s no “catch” about this offer—it’s just
plain and honest. To prove it, you can refer
as to my financial position and way of doing
business to the Manager of the Commercial Dank
of Australia, Collins Street, Melbourne. He’ll
vouch for me.
Send down for a box to-day—once you smoke
them you'll make it a habit, and buy regularly
from me. When ordering, say whether you
like light, medium, or dark colors.

The World’s Standard
Valveless Engine.
THE life history of a FERRO ENGINE would be
very interesting were we to follow it from its
embryonic stage on the blue prints of the
designers, through the various phases of infantile
life, till it emerges from the factory to be transported
to some particular spot on old mother earth, to fulfil
its destiny as the WILLING SLAVE OF INDUSTRY.
From icy pole to torrid zone, from far-off Alaska
to Australia, the sun never sets on the “ FERRO.”
THE CURSE OF ADAM has no terrors for the
men who own them. A man must needs sweat, but
he can sweat to better advantage than by yanking a
saw, pump handle or chaffcutter. Turn these jobs
over to the “ FERRO ” ; they are built to do them.
If you do not happen to own one, get busy and
write the nearest agent, who will be only too happy
to suggest the right sweat-preventer for the job.

Stationary, Portable or Marine use:

Took Every Hair Off, A Pitiful
Sight. Kept Someone Night and
Day to Prevent His Scratching.
After Second Application of Cuti-
cura Ointment, Itching Stopped.
Now Has Lovely Skin and Hair
Thanks to Cuticura Remedies.
“I have much pleasure in enclosing a
photograph of baby by which you will see
■
that there is no
trace of eczema
left. When he
was three months
his little head and
face became one
mass of running
eczema which
took every hair
off his head, and
his little eyes
wereal most closed
up. He became
a pitiful sight,
and it kept some-
one night and day
to prevent him
from scratching: himself and making- it bleed.
The doctor attended him for about three
months and gave us ointments and medicines
which did him no good. Then we turned
to patent ointments. Still no result. We
felt daunted until we read of a cure by ti e
Cuticura Remedies. Then we carefully
applied Cuticura Ointment. After the second
application the itching stopped. He made
no further attempts to scratch, and in a
week he was on the high road to recovery.
We continued with Cuticura Soap and Oint-
ment, and in about five weeks there was no
trace of eczema, He has lovely skin and
a beautiful head of hair, thanks to Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment.” (Signed)

Watch Your Skin Crow Clearer
Using soap and water only is expecting Nature to do too much.
Chaps, rough or red skin, sallownessi, blotches, wrinkles, and
other unsightly skin conditions result from the presence of ex-
traneous matter which soap and water does not always eradi-
cate. Help Nature, and keep your skin in tone by using
Icilma Fluor Cream
(Greaseless).
Every day, especially before going out, apply a little of the
cream, and enhance your beauty. Good for preventing
sunburn and freckles.
The native girl reminds you that ICILMA is
the product of a Natural Spring in Algeria.

sample of Greaseless Cream will be sent by

Business circular of one of Bruce Smith’s colored
brothers sojourning in N. S. Wales: “Application
from M. D. Mulaki. I want honest people to attend
to this. Wanted professional cleaning all sort, inside
or outside. 1 am very honest, poor respectable man.
Native of Colombo with excellent references from
English Irish and Scotch people. Been butler and
waiter this country. Been doing by day work to
pay my way. Want nice honest liberal people of
morality and civility to see my diary record of refer-
ences them sort of people been given me this sort of
work cleaning by the day. I got nothing to do with
uncivilised evil mean stingy Europeans of Australia
only, they been telling me lot lies by reading my
papers been annoyed. We all got to live by working
one another. Most of them are mungrells, got union
to give work for their own labor. 1 have; been lost
my money in this country. I can’t see Gentry to
employ butlers or waiters. Wanted cleaning if you
are not too poor or mean to pav few shillings.
Shined all sorts of silvers brasses metals. Door posts
washed if you are not poor or mean.”

It happened at the big lire in Flinders-street,
Melbourne, some years ago. The flow of water was
gradually dulling the flames; nevertheless, there
was still much speculation as to whether Lincoln,
Stuart’s would catch. A spectator, who seemed to
be greatly concerned about uie fate of tiiis building,
addressed a neighbor-—“ Think Lincoln, Stuart’s will
go ?” “I hope to it does,” replied the neigh-
bor. “I’ve lost a couple of bob, , and S can’t find it
in this light!”
“Geofrecl”: This was the postal tariff (or part of
it) in I860:
“COLONIAL, INTERCOLONIAL, AND FOREIGN
LETTERS.
“(Except in special cases.)
“Not exceeding 4oz. .. . . . . .. 6d.
“Exceeding -Joz., but not exceeding loz. .. Is.
“And so on increasing 6d. for every additional |oz.
or fraction of |oz.
“Arrangements have been made with the Colonies
of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and
Tasmania for the delivery of such letters at their
final destination without further charge.”
Ah, they were glorious days before Federation!
“H. Williams”: The brewers of M.L. have brought:
the tied-house curse to a fine art. Not merely beer,
wines and spirits, but every article of hotel con-
sumption except the perishable necessities (bread
and meat), can be ordered only with the approval
of the monopoly, and must be procured from Auck-
land or Wellington, as the case may be. The country
storekeeper cannot so much as obtain an order for 'a
pound of tea. The greed of the monopoly is appal-
ling, and is reflected in “the trade” generally. Just
now I am staying in a large hotel—one of the best
of the tourist houses —where the young girl in the
private bar is expected to approximate 100 per cent,
profit upon her “turnover.” She realises only some-
thing oyer 80. She weeps and gets another chance;
but is warned that she must show an improvement.
In Auckland it is said that there are not more than
two “free” houses in the city (of 90,000 people),
and, taking the Province generally, the same state of
affairs exist. When Watson (of Watson’s whisky)
was in Rotorua, it is recorded that he could not
recognise what was served him as his own manufac-
ture. Same thing happened to Dewar. Also, at Gis
borne last January, it was stated by M e chief repre-
sentative of another leading whisky that he could nor
procure his firm’s brand up to standard in the
town. Again, it was admitted by the proprietor of a
country hotel in the Wairarapa that it was almost
impossible to get first-class liquor in that part of
Wellington province. All of which has had a big
hand in closing the bars in so many districts. The
public has revolted against organised monopoly, and
the whole nefarious system will have to be mended
or ended. Time after time there have been promises
of “reforming the trade from within,” but nothing
has ever been done, and an unfulfilled promise is as
profitable and satisfying as drinking beer from a
gridiron. Personally, I don’t think the M.L. liquor
ring can reform itself. The disease of grab has got
right into its marrow, and will eventually. drive the
monopoly into the grave; whereupon a new boss will
write his name above the old business, and that name
will be State Control.
“flamer”: The lot of the station book-keeper,
which the Clerks’ Union intends to deal with
directly it has secured a fair deal for the city clerk,
is a lot of work. As regards wages, the lot,is /very
little. _ln numerous instances, the station book-
keeper is only a book-keeper in his spare time, his
spare time being the time when, everybody else
being asleep, there is nobody about to tell him to
do something else. This is the job of one station
book-keeper, who gets as a reward a salary of £6O
per annum and keep, a fortnight’s holiday and a
ticket to Sydney and back. He has to attend to the
book-keeping and correspondence of three stations;
is tutor for the manager’s children, teach mg' them,
amongst other things, French and music; looks after
the store; is expected at times to kill and prepare
meat, and assist in the general work of the station;
is special society entertainer (practically on com-
pulsion) when the station has guests; is medical
adviser to the family; and measures all hands for
the clothes they want to order from the city. Also,
he is everything else that anybody fancies lie ought
to be. Yet at £6O, and with moderately comfort-
able quarters, this man is comparatively well
situated. His chief burden is the work he has to
do. If the boss sees the book-keeper idle for a
minute, he fancies he is not earning his colossal
salary, and rushes to find him a job. By the time
the boss returns with the job, five other persons have
also found the idler a job, so he has six jobs to go
on with.

“Exile” (from the land which enjoys the bless-
ings of Freetrade) : Linen goods are to be 25 per
cent, dearer this year because flax is scarce. Who
will whack up this increase ? Not the Belfast linen
workers, for sure! Here are a few prices quoted
in a report on “gombeening,” the Irish for money-
lending. For a tablecloth, which takes four days’
labor, the worker gets 35., or 9d. a day. A linen
sideboard cloth takes a day to make, and brings
4d. A bedspread occupies a skilled woman a whole
week, and she gets 45., equal to 7d, per diem! It
takes a whole day to make a dozen handkerchiefs,
and the worker receives 7d. For embroidering a tea-
cloth a woman was paid Bd. for two days’ work!
And the cloth was sold for 15s. All linen gar-
ments seem to be sewn with blood in Ireland.
THE LETTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out of the past—the faded past—
That I had dreamed was dead to me,
Your letter came; and back are cast
The curtains of my memory.
It comes as from a buried hand,
From one I ne’er shall see again.
Your anger I can understand ;
Your vows I know are only vain.
The little house upon the hill,
Where first we met, I see once more;
I see you in the dorway still —-
And you were always at the door.
How often did you-wait for me,
Yet seldom —never —did we meet!
Your fondness was a mystery
That interested all the street.
We never met; I do not mourn ;
Your face I never hope to see.
But still I smile in placid scorn,
Knowing you still must think of me.
How curt your words! “Sir, just once more
Unless you settle this account,
Proceedings will be taken for
Recovery of the amount!”
N.S.W.
HAMER.

IN BANANA LAND
The Brisbane Courier celebrated its 50tli
anniversary as a daily on May 14. It is now
old enough to know a lot better.
All over the Mackay district one comes
across the brick stacks of the old “tin-pot”
mills, some 25 of which were scattered
around the place in the early days of cheap
niggers and autocratic planters (they are
just cane-cockies now). Those were the days
When raw sugar commanded £4O a ton, and
the capacity of the “tin-pots” was from 50 to
200 tons a season. Nowadays, when there
is a C.S.R. monopoly to feed, and raw sugar
fetches only £lO or £l2 a ton, Mackay owns
10 factories, whose capacities range from
3000 to 1000 tons per season. The old Alex-
andra mill had the first steam plant, the
owners being Davidson and Fitzgerald, who,
from September to November, 1868, pro-
duced 110 tons of sugar. Previously a small
wooden horse mill had turned out a few lb. of
crystals; but the old Alexandra can stand
as the pioneer for all practical purposes.
“Boro-Belle”: “B 208” is wide of the mark
when he asserts that the cane cocky “wor-
ships” cane and grows nothing else, because
compelled to do so by the person from whom
he is buying the land. It certainly is the
practice of the sugar mill managements to
forward their supplies a list containing a
score of approved canes, but that is done
merely to stop the growing of canes of heavy
weight but poor sugar content, which play
the deuce with the mill rollers. Certainly,
too, land-purchasing agreements contain a
clause that cane is to be the sole crop, but
that,, again, is to prevent the farmer growing
nothing but (say) coffee. As a matter of
fact, many farmers in the Mackay district
at one time grew cabbages by the _ cartload,
in order to help them meet their instal-
ments of purchase money. But as soon as
Ihe balance owing had been reduced to such
an extent that the tenant could easily obtain
a loan to pay off the vendor, that tenant
became a whole-hogger, whose cabbage-patch
became a cane field.
Robert Philp has made it known that he
will not again tempt Fortune on the Towns-
ville hustings. The Referendum vote in that
city gave “Yes” a majority of over 300, so
Philp’s resolution is probably wise. If he
enters Parliament again it will be for one
of the new Conservative constituencies near
Brisbane.
The Bananaland Government has appoint-
ed a Board of Advice, consisting of Professor
of Chemistry Steele, Government Analyst
Henderson, Agricultural Chemist Brunnich,
Government Entomologist Tryon, and
Botanic Gardens Director Bailey, to give its
candid opinion about prickly-pear destruc-
tion. The vegetable porcupine, in reply, ele-
vates its spikes art inch or two higher, and
says merely—-“ Come on !”
AMBIGUOUS.
SINGEMOINE : “Any news of the
missionary who went to Lotus Island?”
WHISKERS: “ Well, we heard that the day after his arrival he married two of the piettiest
girls on the island; and we don't know whether he is a hustler for wedding fees or a
Man of Sin.”
The Yankee speculator seems to have smelt
out Queensland and its possibilities. A Cap-
tain Bryne, representing an American syndi-
cate, has secured 4000 acres of country in
the North for rubber and other ex-
periments. He says his crowd is
hungry for 30,000 acres, so there is
reason to keep an eye turned that way.
The idea seems to.be to finance men on 50-acre
blocks, on condition that they sell their raw
stuff to the syndicate, which will erect fac-
tories to treat all that is produced; and in
view of the experience that some northern
sugar-growers have had with that sort of
bargain, the Government needs to look very
hard at the scheme before it lends a shoulder
to push it through.
THE SUICIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From out a noose of hempen rope the soul of Suicide
Arose hnd stood before the Lord of Heav n and 1 ime
and Tide;
Upon the Spirit’s shadowy neck the bruise was
ghostly blue
And in the face of Providence he gazed with know-
ledge new ;
Until the Voice: “Unhappy Soul! What madness
fell was thine,
To take the life the Maker gave and say the guilt
was Mine ?
Dost thou not know the stars below are tethered with
a chain,
And all the silver galaxies are whirled beneath a
rein?”
“Almighty,” said the Soul in turn, “beneath the rod
of pain
I daily bowed a beaten back until the throbbing brain
In anguish found a hempen way to silence and sur-
cease,
And, gazing through a knotted noose, imagined there
was peace.
“Imagination vain I find, for here I catch the peal
Of countless thousand parted souls whose songs im-
mortal reel,
And where 1 thought to touch at last Nirvana’s
dreamless shore,
I find I meet in visions fleet Existence evermore.
“I do not crave in halls of light to hear the songs
divine;
I do not beg again to quaff of Being’s ehaliced wine ;
The only boon I beg of Heav’n is but to slumber free
Of mortal fear and joy and tear through all Eternity.”
The Presence pondered for a space, and then in peace
replied:
“Dost thou not know the Laws below are Laws in
Heaven beside ?
And as the Voice in music died amid the whirling
Spheres,
Again were born new Night and Morn and trembling
Hopes and Fears;
Created and Creator kept their course in Deeps of
Awe,
And Suffering Soul and Maker swept obedient to the
Law !
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, May 20, 1911.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
His Ex. and the faithful Scarlett-runner
are due to-day from the Northern tour, after
visiting nearly every hole and corner known
to the active Intelligence Bureau. Mean-
while Lady Mac, the Vision and her girl
pals this week fled from bazaar committees
and presentation bouquets, and spent several
days on board the Lucinda.
On Saturday the feminine part of Gov-
ernment House motored to North Pine, and
opened a bazaar in the lovely old grounds of
the Tom Petrie residence. The Vision is
still wedded to good works; and the Alex-
andra Home is now the favored charity.
Which is all very well, but if this sort of
thing continues much longer, Society girls
will begin to wear a threadbare look. One
cannot be both charitable and well-dressed
in these hard times.
Mrs. Health-Commissioner Elkington tea’d
and ice-creamed Brisbane’s Very Best _ on
Friday. The pretty bungalow, full of price-
less Indian treasures, was decked with floral
garniture; and the hostess, in a clinging
robe of Coronation blue crepe de Chine, with
some wonderful opals, was assisted by Mrs.
Norman Lindsay, her sister. Mrs. Elking-
ton’s charm as a hostess owes much to her
delightful habit of making one pleased with
one’s self. At the Elkington home I never
feel quite as dull as I really am, my dear.
With a recklessness which, it is to be
hoped, will have no ill-effect on the stu-
dents, the teaching staff of the University
has dived into the vortex, of Sassiety, and
issued invitations for a garden party. Be-
fore the excitement had stopped fizzing, the
students had “played tally” to make ar-
rangements for a dance. And not a. Mud-
kins has risen to denounce this spirit of
wanton frivolity in our academic halls.
Queensland’s sculptor-genius Harold Par-
ker, and the wife of his bosom (a daughter
of Agent-General Robinson), arrived on
Saturday by the Dorset. They are visiting
Parker pere and mere at the ancestral halls
on Dornoch Terrace, overlooking the city.
Artistic Brisbane is reminding itself that it
altvays said, “I told you so”; and, while
photographs of Ariadne are selling well,
every second man one meets went to school
with the conquering hero.
The Girls’ Rowing Club left its skirts and
petticoats at home last Saturday, in order
to thoroughly enjoy its picnic at Merthyr,
Samuel Griffith’s old home. The grass was
excessively long, and the proceedings were
enlivened by the antelope-like hops of the
mothers, cousins and aunts of the competi-
tors, as they 1 giddily frisked through the
jungle. The girls wore "rational costume,”
which looked very well in the boats, but had
an ill-tailored appearance on the “lawn.”
However, no boats tyere capsized, and the
rowing was most energetic.
Elaine Feez is en route to England,
thence to the land of chromatic sauerkraut
and tonic sol-fa sausage, where she intends
to add further polish to her already bril-
liant piano playing.
East Brisbane bowlers were the guests
of Captain and Mrs. Barry last Saturday
afternoon, and the tea and sunshine tossed
up for first prize. The coin fell on its
edge, so it was declared a draw, and every-
body went home satisfied.
We borrowed pretty Rosina Buckmann for
our Musical Union’s production of “The
Ancient Mariner,” and the little lady, who,
made so many friends in Brisbane on her
first visit with the Bengough Company, and
later with the Grand Opera Cos., .found
a packed audience waiting at the Exhibition
Hall to shower her with applause and
bouquets. She received them in a gown of
grey crepe de Chine, liberally besilvered.
Contralto Lena Hammond also distinguished
herself. As for the “Mariner,” candor
compels me to say that his musical chart did
not bring him close enough to the under-
standing of either the choir or the audience.
Miss Dickson, grand-daughter of the late
James R., he who sent the first Australian
Contingent to S’Africa, is about to bestow
her hand and heart on one J. Markwell. Miss
Dickson is by way of, being artistic; conse-
quently, on Wednesday, a number of Art
students, led by Mrs. Crampton Andrews,
danced through an evening, and handed the
guest a bunch of spoons (sterling) as the
nucleus of the household furniture.
If marriages are made in Heaven (which
most married people deny), a lot of overtime
must have been worked there lately. Don t
know how many jobs Queensland has pro-
vided, but the list is long and steadily grow-
ing. The latest, bride and bridegroom to
honeymoon with you in the South are Mr.
and Mrs. Tully, of Ray Station. Mrs.
Tully was Annie Leahy, daughter ot the
late Speaker, John Leahy. Mr. and Mrs.
Tully will return shortly, and a house-party
at Ray Station is to celebrate the golden
wedding of the parents and the wedding of
the son.
Dentist Walter Coe will (d.v.) marry
Miss Evelyn McNab in June. One strong
bond of affinity is that both are ardent sup-
porters of golf. The lady is a daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Alex. McNab, and is keeping
up the family reputation for chic dressing.
It is rumored that the Dalzells, of Dalgai
Station, will shortly go to Fogland, where
Miss Olive’s good looks will be an excel-
lent advertisement for Queensland. . Ihe
elder daughter of the clan, Mrs. Whitting-
liam, has, with her husband, made her home
in “New South.” Mrs. Dalzell is a sister
of Mrs. Joey Bell, and belongs to the Mount
Morgan Fergusons.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
If the present slaughter of opossums is
not checked in some way, that interesting
squeaker will soon be as scarce as the dino-
saur. In the Dalby district alone it is
estimated that 200 persons will be employed
this season exterminating the beautiful little
citizen.
It’s an ill Denham that blows nobody any
good, and if the appointment of a Commis-
sion to inquire into the Yongala disaster is
cold ice for the Marine Board, it is, on the
other hand, a generous helping of fees to
a number of people who may be expected to
appreciate them. Also, there are other ad-
vantages. Thus the Commission has alieadj
learned that the Queensland coast is not
poorly lighted. Denham says so, and he
has had thorough inquiries made on the sub-
ject. Through the Marine Board he finds
that, if six more lighthouses were erected,
there would be nothing to complain of. Un-
fortunately the Yongala won’t get an oppor-
tunity to express an opinion.
Parson Sams is not Bananaland’s only celes-
tial guide who gives directions with his fists.
Pilot Stotten, an Australian-educated busli
parson who doesn’t Wowse, but gets there,
recently struck trouble in a navvies’ camp
while hunting up scattered souls in the Bur-
nett district. Everything was in readiness
for service, when a, burly earth-heayei
walked up and announced that he was going
to “clear out the blanky show.” The Rev.
informed the disturber that, if he insisted
on clearing out the show, it was only fair
to start on the parson. This the navvy
proceeded to do, but found himself floored
for five minutes with a sledge-hammer tap
on the jaw. On recovering he informed
the congregation that “parsons were blanky

AUSTRALIA’S
WINTER PARADISE.
EXQUISITE and ENTHRALLING SCENERY. MILD and BRACING CLIMATE.
Par excellence the trip, for which, at this time of the year, the Commonwealth offers no better.
DURING the Winter months no more enjoyable trip can be taken than along the
picturesque eastern seaboard, through the exquisite Whitsunday Passage and
Hinchinbrook Channel. These scenes of tropical beauty are unsurpassed in
the World.
The ATHERTON and HERBERTON TABLELANDS, 2000 to 3000 feet
above sea-level, possess a bracing climate, rich soil, tropical vegetation and scrubs full
of magnificent timber.
The BARRON FALLS and the TULLY FALLS have no equal in Australia,
in Central Queensland Tourists have an opportunity of visiting MOUNT
MORGAN, near Rockhampton. This great mine—a mountain of gold—has paid
over £7,500,000 in dividends.
The famous DARLING DOWNS in Southern Queensland can be reached b>
train from Brisbane in four hours.
Full particulars and handbooks can be obtained on personal application or by letter to

_ THE =
SURE CURE
The best of food cannot nourish
you unless, you digest it properly.
The relisb for food and the power
to digest it depend on the healthy

action of your
stomach, liver
and bowels.
When these or-
gans are dis-
ordered, your food does not properl y
digest, but ferments and gives off
poisons that enter your blood and
BILIOUSNESS
bring on pains
after eating,
headaches,
biliousness, constipation. Mother
Seigel’s Syrup is the best remedy
for all these troubles, because the
HEADACHES
herbal extracts
of which it is
made quickly re-
store the stomach, liver and bowels
to natural working order. Then
you can relish and digest your
constipation
food, your sys-
tem is freed from
the poisonous
products of Indigestion, and good
health follows naturally. Try the
Syrup, after your next meal.

and with it the doing away of half the trouble the Motor Cyclist has hitherto had to contend with.
Indeed, in wet weather, it is almost impossible to drive with a belt, whatever power you have
at your disposal. For genuine comfort on the road, the “Two-speed” Speedwell is superior to any-
thing else. It generates an easy, comfortable speed, with no vibration, and is perfectly safe
through sand and mud. If these points appeal to you, call, and let us shOw you the machine.

C. Plain: Grant Hervey is not connected
with The Bulletin, and never has been, excepi
that this paper has bought verse, and occasionally
prose, from him. It has no more control over Her-
vey’s politics than it has over those of the probably
very Fat merchant from whom it buys its paste....
Nanoc E.: Very slow and spiritless nightmare....
Languid L.: What next ? Why, the basket, of
course. .. .R.O’F.: Not enough snap in it G.J.
(V.): Some grace, but too slight and unskilful....
A.Y.Z.: If you hadn’t mentioned in the last line or
so that the forest sprite, “with hair of burnished
gold,” was the wattle tree, we would have concluded
that you had stumbled on the bush camp of some
chemical blonde who had been converted to the
simple 1ife....1-1.8. (N.S.W.) : A fascinating inven-
tory of charms, but it isn’t much as verse
Solirab: Sketch ends feebly, and is not particularly
strong at any part of the eight-page journey....
Hugh S.: Brief extract from the pathetic narrative
of Bill: “But aged and feeble he came back a few
years before this story opens to the city that knew
him not. He was now in receipt of an Old Age
Pension and added to his small income a few shil-
lings by sending rabbits to the city that had long
since forgotten him.” And instantly we see the
heartless city standing on the high cliffs of Port
Jackson, like a prima-donna on a concert platform,
with poor old faithful Bill’s shower-bouquet of
rabbits clasped in her hands.... The Sheoak: Sorry
“Hymn” fails. .. .B.C. (Sydney): “Lunch” uneat-
able... .“Bellerive”: Yet another corpse:—
AFTER MIDNIGHT.
After midnight a constable
On his lonely beat
Stopped a burglar’s flight
In a suburb street;
The robber fired to kill
And missed his mark,
Dropped his spoil and dashed
Down a lane in the Dark;
But after him the active
And game officer sped,
Pistol shots were exchanged
And the criminal fell Dead ;
Then the officer turned his
Flickering Lamp Light
Upon the ill-fated man’s body
After Midnight.
....Nix (W.A.) : Terse enough, but you say nothing
new....M.S. (Q.): Same old voices cracked with
age....L.W r . (V.): Clock poem stopped. An old
and well-worn theme.... Apex: It is a dull, care-
fully-constructed rhyme.... Won Hi: Nothing to-
day, John !... .O’Mud: The footnote interested us:
“You would do me a great favor by accepting the
above and printing it.” Hate to disoblige you, but
can’t' be done. .. .C.T.A.: Bald and unconvincing.
No name or address on MS. Altogether a hopeless
production... .E.F.M.: Amiable basket rhymes....
11.W.V.: Your first concern is evidently to rhyme;
and you succeed in all but one instance—where you
couple “shares” with “stars.” Apart from that,
nothing new in it S.J.D.: Motor-hog poem broke
down. . .K.F.N.: “The Six Ages of Drunkenness” in-
terred as requested.... Bill S.: One gasp:—
The Dying Squatter raised his Brow
That was so wet with clammy Dew.
“I heard the Thunder Peel,” he said,
“Did yous blokes hear it too ?”
...Machete: Verse not in our line... Unknown: Un-
suitable .... Aorangi: Dropped gently.... J.O’N.: It
reads like the poem of a man who never laces up his
boots G.C. (M.L.): No J.F.A. (S.A.) : Un-
able to use them. Afraid it would be no use your
sending any more.. . .F.G.S.: After going carefully
through your poem, we feel sure we know who is
causing the fogs on the harbor. .. .Joe L. M.: Send
us some more; winter is coming. .. .S.G.: Decline
absolutely to prophesy about your literary future.
So far as we can see you haven’t got one. ... Selim:
Glad to hear you will remember her; but you will
have to inform the lady privately. It pleased us
immensely to read that “Time is marching onward.”
We were afraid you were going to say that it wasn’t
ripe. .. . A.E.8.: Commendable child’s work. Send
it to one of the weeklies that run children’s pages.
....Cullen: Sincere work, but painfully crude....
Mary S.: But what are “the juicy elect”? It sounds
an ideal market name for a choice variety of toma-
toes Jay Beepee: Too slight Sali: the idea is
small and the treatment clumsy... .R.H.W.: Sorry
to say it is underproof verse. .. .L.J.V.: Neither of
them.... Shearer B.: Dredged one verse out of it: —
My path is strewn with vain regrets.
Behind each bushland tree
As I muse on my wasted youth,
Pale shadows peer at me—-
Oh yes, they peer at me!
Frankly, we don’t wonder at it. We would peer at
you ourselves if we were informed that you were
musing on the other side of the street J.M.T.:
You committed it to paper ; we committed it to the
grave. .. ._S.lv. (S.A.) : “This is my last fond cry !”
You bet it i5!....A. R. Silkstone: Can’t trace un-
less you give us some idea of the date. .. .Waster:
Too wordy, and not much interest.
A pompous shabby-genteeler, who lives in
one of Melbourne’s second-best suburbs, re-
cently poured out blessings on the Labor
party as be applied for an invalid pension.
For good and sufficient reasons, the pension
was refused. Within a month, that shabby-
genteel er was taking the chair at “Liberal”
meetings and calling out “Ordali!” to beastly
Labor interjectors. And the Argus and the
Age were vowing that the “Liberal” forces
represented “the impartial intelligence of the
Great Democracy!”
“Locust” : Apropos of the recent Referenda
defeat, here is a passage from Disraeli’s
“Endymion”—the novel of his old age and
retirement: —
“I have some good news for yon,” said one of
Zenobia’s young favorites, as he attended her re-
ception. “We have prevented this morning the light-
ing of Grosvenor Square by gas by a large majority.”
“I felt confident that disgrace would never occur,”
said Zenobia, triumphant.
It is in this epigrammatic book that one of
Disraeli’s political characters said “Liberal-
ism means the abolition of property and re-
ligion.”
“ J.F.” : Apropos the men who produced
the earliest views of Melbourne (B. 27/4/T1). In
1854 H. G. De Gruchy, an engraver, was at 98
Flinders-line East, on the south side. Mr. Leigh
joined him a couple of years afterwards. They
had active competitors in Fergusson and Moore,
for whom James Munro worked. The firm after-
wards became Fergusson and Mitchell, having
business premises near the Bank of New South
Wales, in Collins-street. Fergusson was a poli-
tician, became an M.L.A., and was Jimmy
Munro’s political mentor. Jimmy outdistanced
his teacher and became Premier. In the early
’so’s there was another lithographer named
Hamel, who issued portraits of Victorian cele-
brities ; and at the same time Sands and Kenny
published views of Melbourne, now eagerly sought
after by collectors. This last firm was the fore-
runner of Sands and McDougall and John Sands.

50 years ago the name of Alcocfc was practically unknown—to-day
it is synonymous with billiards. Why ?
They have always maintained that high standard of excellence,
so scientifically and accurately constructed their tables, cues, etc., that
it is no wonder that the popularity of Alcock T ables has grown so
much.
Gray and many other prominent players have made many of
their largest breaks on an “ Alcock," and are therefore prompt to
proclaim these tables as perfect in every respect.
We make them in all sizes and styles —the u Bijou ” table is a
special favorite for the home.

remedy and all the doctors of repute in this city, but
without any success. I was advised to try Trench’s
Remedy, and from the first dose he has not had the sign

WHAT IS CATARRH?
CATARRH is inflammation of the lining
membrane of the nose and adjoining
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. ,• It. injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and. consumes the
nasal cartilages., The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
want relief and cure ? If so, try our.

Two and a Taxi.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE big red Panhard lumbered along,
and behind in the dust-clouds the taxi
blared. The young man in the car moved
languidly at the sound, and took in a swift vision
of the single occupant of the Machine which can-
not Lie.
“Pierre,” said the young inan to the chauffeur,
whose name, by the way, was Thomas, you
might follow that taxi ”; and from this discrimin-
ating persons will gather that taxi in this case
stood for Girl.
“Yes—sir,” said Pierre, pulling two levers and
moving a knob in the confident and abstracted
manner of those who are on working terms with the
mystic. The car, guided by the masterful hand
of Pierre, fled after the taxi—Fate in the wake of
Romance.
The fair occupant —delicate phrase —was what
those American gentlemen who tour Australia in
the interest of drink cures would call a “ peach.”
In her slender person was combined every perfec-
tion of form and face a prodigal nature could
bestow. Her toilette would have turned Collins-
street on Saturday morning into a seething
paroxysm of envy. Undoubtedly it was the last
word on Dress—impeccable—exquisite—the cul-
mination of Perfect Taste.
The taxi blared on to Brighton, carefully
threading its way through a flood of motor-cycles,
ice-cream tabernacles, tram-chasers and the entire
output of the metropolitan livery stables, for it
was Sunday afternoon, and, as every parched
soul knows, Brighton—the Mecca of the Thirsty
—is outside the Melbourne Sunday-drink radius.
A turn in the road brought the car and the
taxi side by side. The girl turned her head, and
the man in the car offered up a silent prayer to
the little gods of Chance.
Man and maid, youth and flapper—their eyes
meet, and so haps the Alpha in the alphabet of
Love. As for the Omega, that doesn’t matter to
this story.
Was it the ghost of a smile that fluttered under
her lids? Perhaps. Then, as with the wife of
Lot, Fate stepped in. The rear tyre of the taxi
collapsed, and Pierre, hooting loudly and with
great presence of mind, drew up alongside the
cab now, as R. Kipling would say, hors de
combat. Aha !
The driver of the cab was on the ground dis-
mally pinching the deflated tyre, and the girl,
standing up amidst a cloud of furs, turned to the
young man with a petulant moue.
“It is—oh, deflate—what you call go bung-
puncture, eh ? ” said she, with a fascinating
accent.
Against this obvious truth the youth, hat in
hand, was not prepared to argue.
“Yes,” he said, “most annoyin’—take hours
to repair, too.”
The taxi-driver uplifted himself at the voice
grinning broadly.
“Well, I’m ,” he stuttered. But whatever
sentiment, apropos or otherwise, he was about to
propound will never be learned. Like the cele-
brated clock, he stopped short; but whether this
stoppage was due to the fact that the young man
in the Panhard car turned to him suddenly and
delivered himself of a most portentous wink we
may never know. The taxi-driver turned to his
tyre with a strong display of suppressed emotion.
Behold a mystery !
The girl crinkled her brow.
“Whg.t is the matter—you laugh ?” she said :
and there was a little choke in her voice.
“ Nothin’, mum—miss,” said the driver. “ I’m
not laughin’. Nothin’ to laugh at, this ! ”
“No,”said the girl. “Oh, what bother it is—
a trouble.”
“May I,” said the youth, “offer my car?”
“ You are so kind— tres charitable."
“ A pleasure. Awf’lly pleased, you know.”
The girl raised her eyes shyly to the youth. As
with herself his garb was unimpeachable. Its
taste was perfect. The color scheme was ex-
quisite ; grey and green, with a suggestion of soft
tone purples. His hat-brim agreed to a milli-
metre with the last decree of fashion. He exhaled
an atmosphere of wealth, refinement and luxury.
The girl, in her quick survey, accepted him at the
standard she had set. Picking up her purse, she
flicked a coin to the taxi-driver and gathering her
furs about her, she stepped into the red car which
stood throbbing like a materialised headache at the
kerb.
Pierre impassively threw in the clutch and with
a loud hum, which rapidly reached the high-
pitched drone of top speed, the girl and the youth
disappeared from the astonished view of the
taxi-driver. He threw his spanners and tools
with a jangle on the floor of the cab, and standing,
hands on hips, gaped down the road.
“ Well, I’m blowed !” said he.
But why should a red-faced man, performing
the prosaic duties of cab-driving, be blowed at
the spectacle of a departing youth and maiden ?
Who knows ?
Meantime the two in the car were in the toils of
romance. He—shyly pressed by her—had drawn
a card from the recesses of his pocket-book. The
HONORABLE CHARLES WALSINGHAM-
FREYNE ! Observe! We make excursions into
polite society.
“ Mais extraordinaire —an honorable—an Eng-
lish Milor’ ? No ; but the father of the Honorable
Freyne had that title. The Honorable Freyne
himself was travelling through Australia in
search of health and amusement. And Mademoi-
selle? A shrug from Mam’selle, a pout of the
distracting lips. There was a husband. Impos-
sible ! Alas, yes! Here Madame dried her
ravishing eyes. Mr. Walsingham-Freyne was
sympathetic. He learned that the husband of
Madame was a bear—a monster ! The marriage
had been one of convenience—a cruel mother, an
importunate suitor. ' Ah !” . . .
To-morrow her husband would return from a
journey of business, and they would continue
their voyage to France. Madame was known as
Vernet—Madame Vernet. Dear friends called
Her Franeine. Could the Honorable Freyne call
her Franeine? Ah! How bold were the English !
The Honorable Freyne learned also that this
afternoon Madame was abroad to take the air ;
but no, she was in no haste to return to the city.
Would they take the air together, and in the car
of M’sieu ? Ah !
* * * *
It was very late when the big car hummed over
Princes Bridge. Was the brightnessof Francine’s
eyes stolen from the light of the moon, or had the
sparkling sprites of wine crept ? Let us be
charitable. The Honorable drew the girl closer
to him. She raised her face to his ; Franeine was
happy, oh, so happy.
“Ah!” she sighed. Their lips met.
The car drew up at a great pile of boarding-
houses, black and gloomy in the shadows. Not a
vagrant light broke the darkness of the windows,
and the only sound in the dead silence of the city
seemed the pulsing of the car. Pierre pushed a
knob and the engine stopped.
“Bien!” said Franeine.
Would the Honorable Freyne enter for one
moment? The youth drew back, and the girl
clasped his arm as she saw his hesitancy. M’sieu
Vernet was away and the house was asleep.
What cared they for Madame Grundy ? Their
hearts ! Ah, their hearts !
The same old lie.
Into the shadows of the portico the scent of
the verbenas crept, commingling with the intan-
gible perfume of Francirie’s silks. Romance was
in the air; the moments quivered with emotion.
Together they watched the tail lights of the car
disappear round the coiner. Why had the Hon-
orable Freyne dismissed his chauffeur? Naughty
—naughty man ! The Honorable Freyne confessed
that the palatial hostelry honored as his temporary
residence was near at hand, and Pierre was
a-weary. Poor Pierre. Pauvre petit Pierre.
Franeine laughed.
Silently they ascended the stair. On a landing
he felt himself pressed to a seat. The Honorable
Freyne would wait —just one moment. And she
was gone.
Through the dark he heard a voice raised and
as suddenly hushed to silence.
“Strange,” thought Freyne. “Was that a
man’s voice?” Surely—but no; Franeine was
greatly daring were she not sure of her husband’s
absence.
What a time she was !
At last he heard the rustle of her silks. How
sorree —oh, so sorree she was had he so long waited.
There was old Mignon. Had M'sieu heard ? Ah,
yes—gruff was her voice. Mignon was her maid,
so old—she had retired, and Franeine had climbed
the so steep stair to reassure her. But yes
Would M’sieu so excuse the room — une chambre
& eoueher ? What mattered it, there was no bou-
doir? Franeine without a hat was even more
ravishing than behind the allurement of a veil.
She tossed the discarded millinery upon the dress-
ing table and knelt on the floor beside him with
upturned face.
Freyne stooped. For a second he gazed deep
into the eyes of Franeine. Ah ! Their lips met.
A chill draught of air struck Freyne’s cheek.
He raised his head. The door by which they had
entered was wide open, and across the shadow of
the outer darkness stood a man. Behind him,
peering sleepy-eyed, was an undersized youth in
shirt-sleeves. The kitchen boy, thought Freyne,
with visions of witnesses, writs, divorce, court
and the counsel, shy co-respondent, etc. For
a moment he was paralysed, and Franeine
clutched his arm convulsively.
“ Victor,” said she.
“So,” said the man, and then, turning to the
lad, he added : “ Go ! ”
Freyne rose to his feet. Francine’s hands were
still clasped on I^is arm ; and her eyes were cast
down. The man carefully closed and locked the
door. He put the key into his pocket and crossed
to Freyne. He was a big man and a foreigner,
with hair brushed off his forehead in the accepted
continental mode.
“ A pretty fellow,” he said. “ Pah, M’sieu, I
should break your neck ! ”
“Oh, no,” said Freyne, “you won’t. It’s
much too valuable to you and this—er —lady.
Isn’t it?”
The man looked him up and down silently.
Franeine was watching him abstractedly from a
lounge.
“Besides,” added Freyne; “it might be
beastly awkward ; and then, you know, it might
spoil your game, and that would be a pity—
you’ve played it so often before, eh ? ’’
Franeine laughed.
“You are ver’ brave, mon cher said she, “or
what you call impudent—audacious—eh ? ”
The discussion lasted long. The outraged honor
of M’sieu Victor could only be solaced at a figure
commensurate with the high standing of the
Honorable Freyne.
At last the Honorable Freyne wrote his cheque
and handed it to the virtuous husband of Madame,
who folded it carefully and put it in his pocket-
book.
“I regret,” said Freyne, “to-morrow being a
bank holiday, you will not be able to collect your
hard-earned gold. However, the joy will be all
the better for the anticipation. Get all the anti-
cipation you can —don’t forget. Good-night.”
He was gone.
Franeine watched his retreating figure from the
open window ; her slight frame shaking with
laughter. She turned holding out her arms.
“Le sot! ” she cried.
“Franeine,” said the man, “ e’est drble."
* * * *
As Freyne had said, the day following was a
bank holiday, and the cheque remained in the
pocket-book of Victor —and in the rapt anticipa-
tion of Franeine, his wife. To celebrate the
occasion together they would visit a theatre; and
then a little supper and a bottle of wine. Ah !
how beautiful is the world.
A taxi summonbd by telephone would call for
them at a quarter to eight, and at a quarter to
eight sharp Franeine and Victor stepped from
their lodgment, happy, radiant, bursting with
vitality and benevolence toward all humanity.
The light was shining full on the face of the
taxi-driver, who stared into the night immobile
and sphinx-like. Franeine started and clutched
the arm of Victor. A chill gripped her heart
strings.
“ That man—look ,” she gasped.
Victor looked ; he, too, was startled.
“ It is—no—yes.”
“S-s-s-sh” said Franeine.
And still the taxi-driver sat motionless as an
image. Victor and Franeine got into the cab
haunted with misgivings. Together they dis-
cussed the calamity of the taxi-driver en route to
the theatre. Franeine beat her bosom. Victor
almost swallowed his cigarette in his agitation.
Terrible !
At the theatre they alighted ; together they
peered again at the driver, .mute and military. It
vms the Honorable Charles Walsingham-Freyne.
Victor became purple with wrath, his hair stood
on end.
“Sacred name of : ”
“ Ah-ah-aaaaaaaaah-ah-ah ! ” blared the taxi,
shooting off into the crowded street. “ Aaaaaaaah-
ah-aaaah ! ”
Franeine looked at Victor; Victor stared at
Franeine.
“Un chauffeur ,” said Franeine.
“ Pig ! ” said Victor.
The morning of the next day a foreign lady and
gentleman—the gentleman most impressive, the
lady most beautiful—presented a cheque at Desk
F of the Oriental Bank. Sorrowfully they received
it back marked “NO ACCOUNT.”
“ Ah !” said Franeine.
“Oh !” groaned Victor.
At the taxi stables the day following a driver
was discoursing. “’E takes the bun orl right,
does Charlie. There was’e in lavender kid gloves,
shiny shoes, cuffs an’ orl. * May I,’ sez ’e, ‘ hoffer
my car?’ ’ls car, blimey! An’’e tips me the

ADVISED to have veins
" CUT OUT—Another ZAM-BUK TRIUMPH.
MRS. C. SYER, who lives at 27 Frank-
lin Street, Glebe, Sydney, says
“While going about my household
duties I came in contact with a piece of wire-
netting, which entered and tore a varicose
vein in my leg, as well as cutting the leg
itself severely. Blood-poison set in, and my
leg inflamed and broke out something fright-
fully. It swelled up to a great size, and the
inflammation extended right down to the
foot, my toes being hardly discernible. I
could not sleep at night, for no matter in
what position I put my leg I could get no
ease. The wound discharged profusely, and
altogether I suffered in a terrible manner.
“ I tried all kinds of ointments and so-called remedies in vain; in fact, they made my
leg worse instead of better. Then a nurse recommended me to use a certain ointment,
which not only did me no good, hut nearly drove me mad with pain, so coarse and stringent
it must have been. I was strongly advised to go to the hospital and have the veins cut out-
“ Thus I suffered for three long years. At length, one day I happened to read of the
wonderful powers of Zam-Euk in cases of poisoned wounds and kindred troubles, and I
determined to try the Balm. So I purchased a pot of Zam-Euk, and the.very first appli-
cation cooled the burning surfaces and took out a lot of the irritation. Continuing the
applications of Zam-Buk, the wound was purified and cleansed of all poisonous matter,
and the process of healing commenced. The deep tissues knitted together nicely, and the
sides of the wound and outer surfaces contracted, until finally the wound was completely
healed, and, thanks entirely to Zam-Buk, new healthy skin grew. Now my leg is as
sound as it ever was. I consider Zam-Buk stands in a class by itself apart from all other
so-called healers, and I recommend it to all.”

f HOUGH in her eyes and on her hair
There dwelt the old-time grace,
He saw the marks which wear and tear
Had wrought upon her face.
He said: “Your hair was lustrous brown,
With gleams of gold shot through;
A man might travel up and down
The world, nor match its hue.
“Your eyes! If I had Raphael’s art
I might essay to tell
How ’twixt long lashes, wide apart,
They wrought a wonder-spell.
“Do you recall that day of days
(’Tis with the dead and done)
When passion set our souls ablaze,
And made us two in one?
“Do you recall the day it was—
The light on land and sea,
The golden glamor on the grass,
The splendor on the tree?
“A bird, a thrush (in love, for stire),
Behind us on the hill
Made melody, so rich, so pure,
All other sounds grew still.
“That garden by the sea still blows,
The tide about it crawls ;
Night through, day through, rose after rose
Grows red, and fades, and falls.
“And lovers meet, as wo that day,
A laughing, joyous band:
' > dear, wide eyes of honest- grey,
Whose was the parting hand?
Who drew the bolt from out the vault,
Who quenched our passion-flame?
Was yours the fault, or mine the fault,
Or were we both to blame ?
“Or was it that, from time afar,
When Primal Darkness reigned,
Ere yet was sun or mfion or star
Our parting was ordained?
“Well, let the fault be yours or mine,
Or some predestined doom;
We had at least one /thrill divine,
One hour of goldcjjn bloom.”
They parted, and the woman sighed—
Her life an empty dream. ...

He makes a poet’s theme.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rpHIS story is written to prove nothing
that is not already known. Every
wise man steers clear of a live wire,
and most of them give boys a wide berth.
The combination wrecked the character and
the home-life of Mr. William Fsmythe.
Psymthe—one does not pronounce the initial
P —was a well-preserved gentleman of 55.
He read the Sydney Morning Herald
every day, and agreed with most of its
leaders. Which sums up very concisely his
politics and his intellectual attainments. He
was very dignified to the world: you guess
that by the inspiration of that redundant
though decorative P.
At home, it is alleged, Psmythe unbent.
His wife, a pretty young woman of about 30,
suspected that he unbent a little too enthusi-
astically ; and she kept a hopeful, careful eye
upon a still prettier and younger woman, a
housemaid named Elsie May. I say a
“hopeful” eye—that is the word —for little
Mrs. Psmythe had found that the prospect
of a life-time of Psmythe was tedious, and
without salt. Young Mr. Follows had
helped her to find this out. Not that there
was anything wrong between them, but they
“understood” (I believe that is the phrase)
one another. A little pressure of the hand, con-
fidences, gifts of flowers, and little secrets
shared together—-nothing in it as yet, but a
promise of much trouble for the peace of
mind of Mrs. . Psmythe—unle.ss Elsie May
tripped.
Please to believe me too, my hand upon
my hgart, that Elsie May had no thought of
tripping, and that, though Mr. Psmythe had
dertainly a nice, easy, fatherly way with the
maids, there was no real encouragement for
ihe hope., of Mrs. Psmythe. Her husband,
though tedious, was really a respectable fel-
low —it has been mentioned that he agreed
with the Herald leaders. Still, he liked to
be regarded, and persisted in regarding him-
self, as a devil of a chap with the petticoats;
and, hang it! a man cannot be always on
his dignity. One frequently observes that
the steadier and more absolutely, convention-
ally suburban a man is, the greater his im-
agination of himself as a Romeo, and a Don
Giovanni rolled into one.
To keep this illusion of skittish youth,
Mr. Psmythe took Sandow exercise very
methodically each morning, and studied his
body closely in the glass for any signs of ad-
vancing eld. He had been something of an
athlete in his youth, and had taken proper
pride—and still did —in the clean, comely
lines of his flesh. All of which, the parson
will tell you, is very wrong, for the body is
a vile thing, and no matter for the pride of
any church-going, God-fearing man. Well,
this poor, middle-aged gentleman was pun-
ished for his upwardness.
One hardly knows whether to bow to the
Lord or abuse the Devil in the manner of his
chastening. As it was thrust upon him by
the hand of a hoy, it may certainly be per-
mitted to you to hold your own opinion on
that point. It happened that a drip from a
loose slate in the roof fell upon the bunched
wires of the electric bell system in the attic
of the Psmythe villa. It ate away the copper
until the bells stopped working, and Mrs.
Psmythe’s visitors, including young Mr. Fol-
lows, had to bang with their fists or um-
brellas upon the front door; and bang hard,
too, for the servants’ quarters were well re-
moved from the region of the street frontage.
This loud advertisement of Mr. Follows’s de-
votion was not pleasing to Mrs. Psmythe,
and she asked her husband to call in an elec-
trician. This he did.
Anybody who knows this species of crafts-
man knows that the chief worry of his life
is that entailed in the search for methods of
killing time. He comes to the house with a
bag of tools and an apprentice, who carries
a coil of wire. He spends half an hour
pressing all the bell-buttons in the house,
sending his disciple into the kitchen to verify
the fact, of which he has been informed, tnat
the bell will not respond. This overwhelms
him with astonishment. If he be a capable
man he will make a number of vague cal-
culations on a dirty piece of paper, and,
after sending the apprentice back to his shop
dr castle (I don’t know where such men live)
for some more wire, he calls for a step-
ladder. When the boy returns both of them
disappear through the manhole in the kitchen
ceiling, and are lost to sight for several hours.
The master-electrician tracks down the
break in the wire in the first quarter of an
hour; and 30 seconds with a pair of pliers,
a brushful of spirits of salt, a piece of tin-
foil, and a spirit flame, restore the circuit.
But how can a man charge you £1 for any-
thing so simple! He and the boy, therefore,
make hammering noises on the beams from
time to time, and sometimes the boy puts
his foot on the laths of the ceiling, and a
new crack opens in the plaster. Bear with
me; all this is more' than a little relevant.
Mrs. Psmythe’s tradesman called at the
absurd hour of 8 o’clock in the. morning.
Mr. Psmythe was at that time just rising
from bed. By the time the electrician had
repaired the trouble just above the kitchen,
Mr. Psmythe was busy at his Sandow exer-
cise ; and when the man and boy, in pursuit
of occupation during the next couple, of
hours, started to explore the upper regions
of the villa, Mr. Psmythe had taken up his
position before the glass door of the ward-
robe, and was extending and flexing his
biceps, and admiring the fine expansion of
his chest; and, looking through the ventilator
in the centre of the ceiling, the electrician
was at once interested and amused. The
hoy crept up beside him very quietly, and
they both studied Mr. Psmythe. It would
not be modest to describe Mr. Psmythe’s
clothes.
The boy reached out to steady himself,
and his hand came into contact with the two
wires which ran up the gas-connection from
the bedroom on their way to the kitchen.
He smiled, and, remembering that the cir-
cuit had now been restored, scraped away
the insulation with his penknife. He laid
the two bared wires together, and a bell
rang far away in the distance. He kept the
wires together, and the bell went on ringing.
It was a long way off, and his boss was so
interested in Mr. Psmythe that he did not
notice.
Suddenly the door of the bedroom opened,
and Elsie May bounced in.
“Did you ri ?” she began, and then
her eyes and her mouth opened,, and she
stood gaping while Mr. Psmythe dived for a
blanket; stood gaping, too surprised and
horrified to move, when Mr. Psmythe tripned
over a boot and fell, rolling to her feet, and
clutching her skirt to stop himself.
At that she gave a little squeal, and
turned to see Mrs. Psmythe entering the
room.
“Cripes!” said the electrician. He and
the boy crept cautiously to the back of the
house, and began hammering on a beam.
The decree nisi was made absolute last
week.
HASSAN.
A Hidden Document.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FRANK Hazelton, four weeks married,
walked out of the door of his villa
at 9 o’clock in the morning. The
little garden was bright with roses, and he
paused because of a tender notion. That
notion was made concrete by the gathering
of four big saffron roses, perfumed and
dewy, and with the delight of a lover he
ran back into the house.
Ruth was sitting at the writing-desk. As
he came in with a hurrying step she uttered
a faint litle gasp, a crimson flush ran from
her neck over her face, and he saw her
thrust a sheet of writing-paper under the
blotting-pad. She thanked him prettily,
but was nervous when he kissed her; she
kept her hand pressed on the blotting-paper,
and fear was hidden at the back of her
brown eyes. So the little gift was a failure,
and Frank went' depressed to his work. ...
And all the morning the foolish question
drummed back into his brain: What did
Ruth hide?
That was a dangerous speculation in the
irritable reaction which comes with the re-
turn to daily work after a four-weeks honey-
moon. Hazelton made four bad mistakes
that morning, for he was following trails
along his memory. And the dogs threw
up their noses at the name of Reginald
Bx-yan.... “Cousin Reggie”. .. .Was he in
town? Or hanging round what woman in
the country?
Then Reggie rang up.
Reggie’s first hour in the city was always
spent in ringing up—sure token of his wo-
manish temperament. Hazelton was tenth
on the list, but had no reason to know he
was not first. He heard the fluty voice,
“Didn’t know your ’phone number. . . how is
Ruth?. . .want to call as soon as the spoonin’
days are over (Reggie was always imperti-
nent) . . . both of you to lunch . . . then
make it Thursday.
All day long, therefore, Hazelton saw
Ruth as a picture or hateful loveliness,
flushed and fluttering, her hand pressed hard
on the writing-desk, and the sombre depth
of fear in her eyes. And his ears were
filled with a voice which fluted, fluted
through a telephone.
“Reggie’s in town : rang me up this morn-
ing,” he said when he went home. He
could have sworn that her eyes began to
flicker towards the desk, but stopped on
their way. Then he looked for the fear in
them, and so made her nervous.
“I—l didn’t know,” she stammered, as
any bride will stammer under a glare. Thus
did Hazelton’s suspicions receive their first
confirmation.
They lunched on Thursday, and were all
miserablv distressed. So distressed, that
Reggie held Ruth back in the corridor of
the restaurant to ask what the mischief was
the matter with Frank? Ruth, not know-
ing, had a strain in her laugh as they went
away. And Frank began td be filled with
that blind rage which leads some men to
the gallows, some to the divorce court, and
some to the club bar.
And theirs might have been a perfectly
happy world if Frank had not looked for
four roses to pin on his wife’s dress, and
Ruth, in a shamed agony of modesty, had
not hidden under the nearest cover her
laundry list.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take ;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache —a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.
