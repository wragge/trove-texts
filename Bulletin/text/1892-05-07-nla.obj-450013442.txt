INFLUENZA!
Do you wish to be comfortable in your mind as to your liability to this
distressing disorder ?
Then always keep a Bottle of BOSISTO’S “PARROT BRAND”
EUCALYPTUS OIL by you, and ready for immediate use by night or by
day. It is a germ killer. Sprinkle it on your pillow at night. Use it in a
vaporiser—a few drops mixed with water, and steam the apartment. Inhale
the steam if there be nasal congestion or throat troubles.
Dr. Brendon Curgenven, of Kensington, London, writes of the Oil : —“ I
have directed the spray to be used, and oil sprinkled on the pillows at night,
and I am convinced I have saved many from the disease.”
For Rheumatism, Coughs, Colds, Influenza and Liver Troubles,
BOSISTO’S
“Parrot Brand” Eucalyptus Oil
Is the most useful remedy in existence. Never be without it in the house.
It is sold in bottles at Is. each throughout all the colonies and in Europe.
Be sure you ask for BOSISTO'S “PARROT BRAND” EUCALYPTUS

DR, KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AW ARE,-DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OF HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS CP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE;
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALT, AS FOLLOWS
IF THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OF ALL VICES, IF NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OP AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS. AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIE FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HAEM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.
AMONG WHICH ARE
ACNE (FLESH WORMS), PIMPLES (ESPECIALLY ON THE FOREHEAD),
DARK CIRCLES ROUND THE EYES, SLUGGISH PUPILS, AND EYES
WITHOUT LUSTRE, HE HAS A HAGGARD, TROUBLED LOOK, HIS
MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO
REVERIE AND DESPONDENCY.

YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE DOCTOR WITHOUT DELAY.

Lord Macaulay and the “Vote for Thrift.”
There is hardly a single fallacy in science,
politics, art, or morals for which support cannot
be quoted in the name of some one or other
of the illustrious dead. The other day, in one
of the Sydney papers, an individual represent-
ing the little baud of parochialists who style
themselves the National Association, and signing
himself “ Testin’a Lente,” dashed to the fore
on behalf of the political representation of the
alleged virtue called “ Thrift,” and backed four
inches of personal letter by a column-and-a-half
of matter from a speech by Lord Macaulay on
universal suffrage. “ Festina Lente” intro-
duces his quotation from the Whig historian by
the remark that the voice of the Henry
GEOROE-ite is heard in the land, and that many
experimentalises in various kinds of socialism
are crowding to the front with malice afore-
thought and prepense to do or die ; hence :
If there is anything in these arguments (Macaulay’s),
it is to be observed that the results predicted as naturally
following on the “ one-man-one-vote ” will be disastrous
to every individual in the community, including the sup-
porters as well as the opponents of that principle.”
This sentence is followed by a selection of grue-
some prophecies from Lord Macaulay’s jere-
miad levelled at the “ People’s Charter,” a
speech which would, by the English Conserva-
tives of to-day, be regarded as narrow and
bigoted, but it is very evident that nothing
can be too narrow or too bigoted so that it
subserves the interest of the National Ass., and
bears the burde'u of the proof in the panniers of
tiie past.

Macaulay is accepted by nobody in the
character of a serious politician. Pyrotechnic
historian, brilliant essayist, gifted ballad-
writer, eloquent conversationalist— all these he
was pre-eminently. A distinguished master of
.State-craft he was not, and Ids great literary
abilities effectively precluded him from such
distinction. John Morley has been obliged to
admit that eminence in politics is antagonistic
to eminence in literature—and vice versa.
Another reason that the speech should be
barred from Court as reliable evidence for one
side or the other is that it was delivered as a
party speech to achieve a party end, and at
very best can only be considered as a capital
ex-ample of special pleading. Moreover,
Macaulay s views regarding socialistic legisla-
tion must of necessity be empirical, for in
his day socialism was only just beginning
to shape itself into the form of a
science. The very opening sentence of the
speech condemns it; “The essence of the
charter is universal suffrage; ” and simply
because it is such and no other it stands pre-
judged and pre-condemned in the opinion of
Macaulay. He passes sentence with the
same gusto that a criminal Judge would observe,
“the essence of this case is murder,” and
Macaulay continues :
If you withhold that it matters not. very much what
, e J°u grant. If you grant that it matters not at all
what else you withhold.
In the name of the prophet, figs !
* # *
What is the gist of Macaulay’s objection to
universal suffrage ? Simply that it is inconsis-
tent with all forms of government, because all
forms of government as conceived by Macaulay
repose on the basis of private ownership in
laud. Universal suffrage is incompatible with
property— ergo, let the property-holders look
to it ! The plea put forward by Macaulay for
property against manhood, is a plea which can
be used in support of all property against all
manhood. If a man is to be allowed votes in
proportion to the property he holds, the small
property-holder would be very little better off
than the man who holds no property at all. If
any portion of political representation is to be
denied to manhood, why not all representa-
tion ? If property is to be accorded political
power, why not accord to property all poli-
tical power? The machinery of represen-
tative Government is clearly useless, and the
affairs of the State would be far better
conducted by a tyrant who should represent
the greatest number of acres and the largest
bank-balance in the kingdom. Lord Macaulay
denies that such a thing exists in Great Britain
as monopoly in land. He says that the only
monopoly in land that exists is that nobody can
sell an acre of land which does not belong to
him. He evidently forgets that the right to
sell implies also the right to withhold from sale.
It implies a right to advantage oneself by the
necessities of one’s fellows. Such a right, if
conceded to the landholder, must logically be
conceded to the bread-trust or the corn-trust in
a famine year. It justifies the owner of land
through which a creek runs to demand toll
from people dying of thirst in a drought year.
It justifies the king who made a revenue out of
daylight; for land (the soil) is as much a neces-
sity of human existence as water, fire, light and
air, and the ownership of land implies the right
of withholding from the use of mankind that
which mankind cannot live without.
* * *
Lord Macaulay explains that the monopoly
of land is nothing more than the monopoly that
every man enjoys in the use and retention of
articles of bedding, clothing and furniture.
But—the landless man in a land of landed
monopolists lias no monopoly of his own
articles of bedding, clothing and furniture.
The landed proprietor has the monopoly
of such articles, both those in use by him-
self and those he for a season permits the
use of by his landless chattel. Lord Macaulay
denies that manhood should govern ; he asserts
that property should govern. Very good ! Let
the voice of property find utterance through the
mouth of property’s foremost representative.
If the accumulation of much worldly gear means
the practice of much blessed virtue, yclept
thrift,” then in the name of Logic mete out
your political power on a sliding-scale : to the
man who owns an acre give a vote; but to Jay
Gould, or Po human, or Rothschild, or James
Tyson give 50,000,000 votes for they represent
in the material expression of “ thrift ” so many
times the “ thrift ” possessed by the owner of
the one acre.
Federation at any Cost.
Bear Bulletin, — Federation, to all appearance,
is practically dead in Australia, and its pro-
spects of a speedy resurrection are more than
doubtful. Almost every Ministry inserts the
corpse of the old idea in its programme, but
hardly anybody cares for it, or pays any heed
to it, or even recognises that it is there. It is
like a dead guest at a banquet tied with a rope
in its chair, and sitting with an immoveable,
expressionless countenance among the living.
Federation, as an item in the modern political
programme, is just as shadowy and meaningless
now as these other hazy items about “ rigid
economy,” and “developing the resources°of
the country,” and the other ancient sayings
that are kept standing in print in every poU-
tician’s vocabulary. The Democratic party has
practically killed the movement by neglect or
open hostility, and has done itself incalculable
injury thereby. It objected to the Conference
scheme because that embodied “Federation
under the Crown,” whereas the party desired
to form a united and independent Australian
Republic. Ir objected because it also embodied
the vicious principle of a nominee Upper House,
because appeals were to be allowed to the
British Privy Council, because the Governor-
General was to be a British official with power
to bring his brothers and cousins and uncles
along with him to Australia and find billets for
them in this country, because there was
no provision for secession if the consti-
tution proved unworkable, because the
old, nefarious property-vote was tacitly
recognised as the basis of the new State,
because the unspeakable evil of Party
< Government was to be perpetuated—in short,
because the proposed Federal Constitution was
one long, wild shriek of grovel and “ God Save
the Queen” and other vexations. And while the
mass of the people took exception to nearlyevery-
thing contained in the Federation Bill, they
also objected to many other things outside it.
1 hey will not federate with Queensland because
Queensland is a black-labour province, and they
do not wish to bring the curse of slavery into
the new confederacy. They decline to take in
West Australia because that province encour-
ages and patronises the Chinaman, and they
refuse to regard the leprous yellow man as a
brother. And South Australia is also wander-
ing in India after strange niggers, so it, too, is
no longer eligible to enter into an Australasian
League, constructed according to democratic
principles. For all these reasons the Demo-
cracy put its foot down on the scheme advanced
by the Convention, and yet for these very
reasons it should, I think, have supported the
Federation Bill with all its might and influence
and made it the first point in its programme
and the first axiom in its creed. It should have
been prepared, if necessary, to let everything
else stand so that the Federation Bill might
pass but in its own short-sighted way it let
the opportunity go, and no one knows when
it may return.
# # #
The point, to which the Democracy took most
exception was the proviso, so obtrusively put
forward, that the Federation was to be “ under
the Crown. ” Australia is tired of being “ under
the Crown it is weary to death of the Queen’s
Birthday, and the National Anthem, and the
old “Rule Britannia,” and the wild cheering
for Walks, and the grovel, and the Union
Jackism, and all the rest. And just because it
desires independence, it ought to have federated
“under the Crown” cheerfully, unquestioningly,
and with a light heart. Then it could devote
itself to the one effort of obtaining a Republican
majority in the one Federal Parliament, and
the long-dreamt-of Commonwealth would be
realised. As it is, the battle must be fought
separately in seven provinces'; and there are
seven Commonwealths to be created in place of
one before the ideal of a united and independent
Australia can be arrived at. And the Demo-
cratic party is weak by reason of this sub-
division. It is impossible to raise seven separate
States to a white-heat of enthusiasm at one
time. If the Republican party were to win a
great victory in one province, it would probably
do so when the cold fit of apathy was upon the
other six, and, consequently, the single dis-
senting State would stand for the moment alone
and unsupported. The Imperial power might
well hesitate to coerce a seceding continent,
but when the case concerned only a seceding
fragment of a continent it would simply step
upon the solitary recusant with its mail-
clad hoof and wipe it out. The Federal Par-
liament, whether created “under the Crown”
or otherwise, is the lever which is wanted to
move the ancient Imperial edifice off its basis,
and the Republican party has so far declined to
use it. There is no earthly reason or excuse
for this universal apathy. Australia is already
“under the Crown;” if the Federation had
been established on the lines of the Convention,
it could have been no more “under the Crown ”
than it is now; therefore, there is absolutely
nothing to lose by that measure, and the
possible gain is incalculable.
# # #
The same process of reasoning applies to
every other objection. The Convention Bill
threatened to burden Australia with a nominee
Council, which would, undoubtedly, be a
grievous evil and an obstruction to every
attempt at progress. When such a House is
once established it can seldom be got rid of
except by violence or something very nearly
approaching thereto. But still there would lie
only one Upper House to block the way of the
coming Republic, whereas now there are seven,
every one of which is as hopeless and as irre-
conciloable as the Federal Tory Chamber could
possibly be. Under the proposed system,
though the stagnant branch of each provincial
legislature would still remain in existence, it
would be deprived of all power except with
regard to purely local concerns, and the central
House of Fossils would be the only serious
difficulty with which the Republican party
would have to reckon. Therefore, by federating
“under the Crown” the nation would have
abolished six enemies out of seven, and it reck-
lessly threw away its opportunity—the grandest
opportunity which has come in its way since
the beginning of Australian history. And, in
like manner, because the imported Governor-
General would inevitably prove an obstruction
that would have to be shifted—possibly by force
—before independence could be achieved, the
democracy prefers to adhere to the old system
whereby seven Governors, all equally objec-
tionable, will have to be shifted separately
before the same result can be arrived at. Also,
because the recognition of the British Privy
Council as the last Court of Appeal is an absurd,
degrading, expensive, and vexatious system
which would require, sooner or later, to be
abolished, despite the opposition of the Federal
Governor and the Federal Upper House, there-
fore the mass of the Australian people seem
resolved to drift along according to the old
policy, whereby the same old evil exists in an
equally aggravated form, and seven Tory Coun-
cils and seven imported Governors stand in the
way of any reformation. Even the irrational
and barbarous property-vote could be made no
worse by the establishment of the Federal
Legislature ; and the frantic worship of British
royalty which is embodied in the spirit of the
proposed Constitution is already embodied in
the seven separate Constitutions of Australasia
to an equal extent, so that it isno new evil, but
only the already existent evil in a new shape,
and the abandonment of Federation will not
diminish it in any way whatsoever.
* * #
In addition to all these considerations there
are other reasons why the Australian democracy
should give a solid vote for Federation under
almost any circumstances and at almost any
price. At the present moment the great mass
of voters in the white-labour provinces hesitate
to associate themselves with the slave-policy of
Queensland, with the imported Asiatic devices
of South Australia, and the Chinese tendencies
of the politicians of Perth. Therefore Australia
threatens to deliberately throw away the chance
of settling the labour difficulty for good and all.
If the federation is established, and the Queens-
land Kanaka, the Northern Territory Coolie,
and the beloved Chinaman of Western Australia
are all taken into the League, then the majority
in the federal Parliament can declare, as its
very first act of public policy, that no Chinese,
Hindoo, or Polynesian labourer, or cheap
indented pauper of any kind shall thereafter be
impoited into Australasia under any pretence
or condition whatsoever. The solid votes of
Tasmania, Victoria, and New ,South Wales
with or without the assistance of MaoriknT
which is but a problematical member of t)’
Commonwealth—would be more than suffieirw
to man down the three cheap labour provincp
Jsy its negligence and indifference, therefor- 8 '
the Australian democracy deliberately rejects 6 ’
on account of the Kanaka and Chinese
—-the only means whereby that problem can I
settled. Sooner or later, nodoubt, Queensland win
itself abandon its ruinous Kanaka-labour p o ]ie 1
and thus make itself eligible for admission iJ’
a Federation of white Australia, but by !
time, in all probability, there will be half,
million or more assorted niggers who will hav
to be taken over as Australian citizens ■ ln < i
members of the Republic, and the same prosne 1-
applies to its two western neighbours. Rette
far to federate now with the Queensland slave'
owners and thus gain the power to abolki,
slavery, than to wait until Queensland repent*
through ruinous experience, and then take over
the ruin which that experience has brought
### ° '
In short, what the Australasian democracv
needs is Federation at any price-Federation
it need be, with the property-vote, the importer!
Governor-General, the nominee Upper Cham
her, the British flag, and the so-called Natiomi
Anthem—Federation with the Chinaman tlm
Kanaka, and the Coolie—Federation “ under
the Crown ” in its baldest form, if no better can
be had. It has all these evils already, but thev
are so diffused through seven Legislatures and
seven Governors, and seven separate and indivi-
dual grovels, that they cannot be attacked to ad-
vantage. If Australasia unites to bring about
the millennium, instead of waiting till seven mil
lenniums arrive before uniting, the ad van'
tages are incalculable. For it will thereby
create a central power which can abolish
the nominee system, the imported Governor
the property-vote, the Chinaman, the Kanaka’
the National Anthem, and all the rest in one
act, instead of struggling to conduct seven
detached battles which are lost for want of con-
centration. And, above all things, when the
time comes for secession from the empire, Aus-
tralasia will then secede unanimously, as one
great state, instead of breaking off in feeble
detached sections, and—for the possibility must
be faced—being wiped out in detail. Probably
the democracy would have realised these things
if it had not been that Parkes was the leading-
spirit in the Federation movement, and never
except by accident, has Parkes done any
public act which did not deserve to be
viewed with suspicion. In the present case
by accident this shifty place-hunter, in his
desire to boom the Imperial interest, devised a
scheme that was worthy of public support, in
that it would have murdered Imperialism and
cemented it under its own hearthstone, but the
nation, remembering his past record merely
asked in reply, “ Can any good come out of
Nazareth? As it chanced, some good had
come out of Nazareth, but the event was too
surprising to find credence.—Yours &c. Titus
Salt.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Healthful Quarrel.
The financial world of Melbourne has been
disturbed, almost horrified, by what is practi-
cally a newspaper controversy between
Attorney-General Duffy and Mr. Justice
Hodges on the subject of the latter’s gentle
treatment of a swindling bank-manager. People
have probably got the well-worn facts of the
(■. A. 1 aylor case off by heart, and are tired,
no donut, of wondering why Justice Hodges
waxed emotional whilst sentencing such a
rascal to far less than his due. Also,
they are weary of looking for a reason why
Attorney-General Duffy, if dissatisfied with
laylors sentence, didn’t immediately issue
instructions for a further prosecution of the man
and say no more about it. Duffy was from the
first the national instrument for bringing
Taylor to justice, and if Hodges didn’t supply
enough ot that article at once it was easy
enough to bring the prisoner along a second
time, for another serve. After the public howl
of astonishment had died away nothing more
would have boon heard of G. N. Taylor’s
inadequate sentence, but for the “ pegging-
away at it of a few journals, including The
Bulletin. ’The result of this out-spoken
criticism was that the Attorney-General, whilst
wooing the electors of Kilmore, found it neces-
sary to express regret that Judge Hodges had
been too lenient with Taylor, although he
didn’t dwell upon the fact that he (Mr. Duffy)
had already decided not to institute any further
proceedings in the matter. The Attorney-
General, it will be observed, had practically
endorsed the two-years’ sentence by dropping
the rest of the case against Taylor. He was
discreetly mum in Melbourne, and would have
preferred, no doubt, to remain mum in
Kilmore, but the electors didn’t let him. The
Kilmore speech proved a great blessing to the
community. It moved Justice Hodges to
explain why he had let G. N. Taylor off with
a couple of years, and the learned gentle-
man s explanation was a ghastly failure. The
explanation provoked a reply from the
Attorney - General, and the reply, whilst
rather crushing for Hodges, was likewise a
condemnation of Duffy for having allowed a
shortcoming of justice to pass without official
protest or comment. Most people will consider
that this stirring up of the Taylor case lias
made it stink worse than ever. Stinks of
that kind have wholesome after effects, and
ought to be industriously sniffed at. The con-
cluding paragraph of Attorney-General Duffy’s
long letter to Mr. Hodges suggests a conflict of
thoughts to the intelligent reader. He says—
“ Some day public opinion may compel the
Legislature to confine Judges to interpreting
the law, and to give to juries the power of
determining the sentence, understanding that
though Judges are more learned in the law than
juries, juries are often gifted with more practi-
cal ability and greater common-sense than
some Judges.” The Bulletin has many times
said all this. But it wouldn’t do for Melbourne
juries to fix sentences for robbers who have got
away with the spoil, so long as defendant’s

ies and addresses of all the jurymen on the

jiioneV with extreme regularity, the patient being
thrown out at the front door when behind in her
avmcnts. Also, they collected the customary
“ testimonial ” in advance, and before the
miserable woman went away to die in horrible
* y she furnished them with a document
etting forth that she had been cured of cancer
j v the use of Hood’s specific, and had lived
lumpily ever afterwards. A good many other
testimonials of the same kind were produced in
evidence, but most of the alleged cancer patients
who had signed them turned up in the witness-box
and solemnly retracted these documents. Some
of them had never really suffered from cancer,
most of them were worse after being cured than
before, some couldn’t be found, and the rest
had been healed till they died—in fact, not one
of the documents appeared able to stand in-
ection. The two “ doctors ” were also unable
to stand inspection. The elder one asserted
cheerfully that cancer was a parasitic disease and
that he had frequently seen the parasites under
a microscope, but being supplied with that
necessary instrument he was unable even to
adjust it, and after shaking it up in all manner
of ways he finally fixed it upon vacancy, put it
carefully out of focus, and looking wildly
through it declared that he saw' something.
He also got lost in a great waste of
anatomy, and his efforts to locate the principal
organs of the human frame were a lamentable
failure ; and after discoursing learnedly about
the “glands” he broke down miserably on
being asked to define a “gland,” and said that
he “couldn’t remember.” The one coherent,
spot in the evidence of either practitioner was
that the elder had once been in the boot-trade,
that neither had any medical training, and that
they would rather go to gaol than reveal the
nature of the “specific.” The public view is
that the men wdio can cure cancer, but don’t,
and who will not part with their secret in the
interests of humanity, ought to be in gaol all
the time.

A Liberal Victory?
Dear Bulletin, —The Victorian elections have
resulted in “ A Great Liberal Victory,” accord-
ing to the Age’s elastic definition of Liberalism,
but- the triumph in question has not justified
local enthusiasts in throwing up their hats and
weeping for very joy. The figures that meet
the Radical eye are not such as it cares to gloat
upon. They give no promise of a strong advance
movement in Victorian legislation, and they
prove nothing save the Melbourne need of a
daily newspaper which shall be capable of
drawing an honest distinction between Liberal
principles and opinions on mere fugitive matters.
Since Richard Speight instructed his solicitors
to “pull” David Syme for libel, the Age has re-
constructed the parliamentary rolls. Members
who condemn the sudden suspension of the
Railway Commissioners (at a time when their
removal could serve no better purpose than the
■creation of an election catch-cry) are classified in
ithe Age as “Conservatives,” whereas every
hardened Tory who, for private reasons, professes
tto approve of this Government coup is included
iin David Syme’s garbled statement of the great
Liberal majority. An examination of the last
list of candidates published in the puissant
penny paper reveals that 57 “ Liberals ” and 11
Labour supporters have obtained seats in the
new Parliament. On the face of this impudent
fiction the Tory residue of 27 members is hope-
lessly “ out of it,” and the vShiels Government
have simply to present Bills as fast as it is
humanly possible to accept them —one down,
t’other come on. The idea of delaying the One-
man-one-vote question until the third session of
a Parliament which contains Liberals to 1
Tory would seem wildly absurd. But when a
few samples of this bulk Liberalism come to be
tested, the dream of democratic progress is dis-
pelled, and the Age bubble melts into thin air.
Of the 68 alleged champions of the people,
exactly three dozen have definitely pledged
themselves to support the One-man-one-
vote principle. Forty members in all have
taken the pledge, but four of them come
under the classification of Conservatives,
in order that they may not be supposed
to have any ideas in common with broad-
minded patriots like squatter Armytage (who
would “sooner live in Hell than under a
Republican form of government ”) or Charlie
Taylor, the unblushing plural votary. These
latter are amongst that Liberal majority in
which the confiding Victorian Radical is told,
by his apology for an “ organ,” to put his
whole trust. Altogether, we find 11 sworn
adherents of dual or plural voting in the
Government-party, and 21 who have sworn
themselves to silence on the question. Exclu-
sive of the 11 Labour platform members, there
are but 25 of the Age- Liberals who could bo
relied upon to support a One-man-one-vote Bill
if Shiels were prepared for its immediate pro-
duction. These are cold, cruel statistics cal-
culated to drive any ardent Republican to
drink. The Age prints and reprints a delusive
table showing that 40 members are for the dual
vote, and 55 are against it, but the hideous
truth that several of the 55 are for plural
voting is carefully omitted. In point of fact
the new Parliament is so little different from its
predecessor that a visible improvement in the
tone of Victorian legislation can scarcely be
expected. The Spiels Government cannot yet
rely upon an endorsement of its action with
regard to Speight and his subordinate Railway
Commissioners. Only 42 members, even on the
Ann’s sanguine showing, have as yet made up
their minds to approve of Speight’s wiping
out, and the possibility of a vote of no-confidence
going through is decidedly threatening. And
if S hi els goes out—what then? —F.

Anarchy.
The daily Anarchist, whose outrage comes
along so regularly by cablegram, is getting
monotonous. W hile the panic lasts every blow-
up, whether it arises through an escape of gas,
or the bursting of a kerosene-lamp, or a small
boy recklessly investigating the nature of a
dynamite cap, is set down to the Anarchists,
just as every surprising disaster used to be set
down to witchcraft, or to a Popish plot, or to
the machinations of the Devil, according to
which bogey was uppermost for the moment. Up
to date there is absolutely no evidence to prove
that there have been any more explosions
this year than usual. There always will
be explosions, so long as gunpowder and
dynamite and nitro-glycerine are manufactured,
and sewer gas isn’t abolished by Act of
Parliament, and electric wires get mixed
up with gas pipes, and magazines are liable to
be struck by lightning, only while the public
intellect is in its present inflamed state
even the unexpected discharge of a gun which
its owner didn’t know was loaded furnishes
material for a cablegram. As matters stand at
present, there have been about three genuine
Anarchist plots discovered, and two of them
were apparently fomented and created by
Government spies who afterwards gave informa-
tion, and got their subordinate conspirators
arrested. Also several police-officers have
“ found bombs ” in several places and
been rewarded for their courage and
vigilance, and so long as the rewards
hold out they will continue to discover,
bombs. And, for the rest, there have been
about the usual average of disasters, most of
which probably arose in the usual way, only
the public was too excited to inquire into the
circumstances. Even a dynamite scare must
be judged by results. When the Land League
was on its alleged murderous way in Ireland,
and the papers were filled with tales of slaughter,
the mortality from violence in that country, in
proportion to population, was less than that of
England, from which it would seem that it was
England and not Ireland which was most in
need of a Coercion Act. In the general frenzy,
however, nobody seemed to notice this fact.
And in like manner it is worth inquiring whether
the total deaths from explosion are any more
when the Anarchist is on the warpath than at
other times. If they are not, then it becomes
more than probable that the explosive variety
of Anarchist is really but a solitary homicidal
crank after the manner of Deeming, only armed
with a bomb instead of a hearthstone.

‘‘ It has always been the policy of our Supreme
Court,” said Judge Williams, of Melbourne,
in granting leave to the defendants in the
M‘Meckan will-case to carry their troubles to
an English Court, “ to encourage appeals to the
Privy Council.” The Bulletin is glad to find
that there is at least one Judge in Australia
who has the courage to acknowledge this, and
at the same time it is sorry to notice that
that Judge seems rather gratified over
it than otherwise. Is Mr. Williams really
glad, in his capacity as a Judge, that the
grand old principle of bleeding the public
to the very utmost is still prospering ? W hat
his words really amount to is just about this .
“It has always been the policy of our
Supreme Court to make justice as precarious,
leaden-footed, and inaccessible as possible by
permitting one litigant to drag another 16,000
miles to get a final verdict, and spend months
in hanging round the doors of a British Court
waiting for it. It has always been our policy
to help along the rich suitor by allowing him to
carry his appeal to the furthest ends of the
earth so that the poor suitor can’t possibly
follow him. For the bloated litigant can go to
England in the saloon of an expensive steamer,
and put up in a high-class hotel, and hire a
costly British barrister to put his case before the
court, and the poor litigant can’t get there at
all unless he works his passage as a stoker, and
at the best he can’t hire any British barrister,
so by this device the rich suitor’s side of the
problem is always heard and the other side
takes its chance. And the Supreme Court of
Victoria supports this principle, because the
rich litigant is valuable as a means of support-
ing barristers and solicitors, and, therefore,
ought to be encouraged, and the litigant
isn’t of any particular use to anybody. Ibis is
what Mr. Williams’ statements practically
amount to, and his obvious pride and
gratification over the present iniquitous system
resembles nothing on earth so much as the
unwholesome pride of the cretin in some Alpine
village, who chases the tourist in order to
show him his awful deformity, and feels hurt
when he can’t overtake him and exhibit his
swelling in all its glorious ugliness. ihe
man who is proud of a nefarious legal systeni
like that of Australia, and the man who is vain
over the abnormal enlargement of his mis-
shapen head, have a good many points in
common when they are carefully considered
Two individuals are at loggerheads in the S.M.
Herald under the caption of “ Why are we
Depressed ?” simply because of the misuse of
economic terms. They seem to imagine that
the terms “wealth’ and value aie
synonyms. Nothing could be farther from the
truth Wealth means products, and nothing
else ; value signifies, in'ordinary phraseology,
the monetary rate at which these products
are rated. Of course the real value of
any form of wealth is its use i a ue,
all other standards of exchange value are ficti-
tious. Other blunders consist in styling invest-
ments in land and shares “capital. Now, real
capital is wealth in use for reproductive pm-
poses ; wealth used in obtaining tribute-right as
rent or in the form of usury is only spurious
capital, as it is not an assistance or incentive to
industry, but simply a clog on effort and a bul-
wark of monopoly.

Lippincott’s last magazine has a subtle
article on the “Secrets of Journalism, ’ showing
how every successful journalist holds an enormous
amount of electric matter, which he dare not use,
for fear of losing his living. Some have tried to
break through the rule, but came to grief—says
the Lippincott writer.
The Brisbane Worker, whose develop-
ment into a weekly was recently noted, is worked
under a novel co-operative system, being eon
trolled by the Queensland labor-unions which
periodically elect the editor. It runs straight in
the interests of the wage-earners and has been
enlarged in size coevally with its more frequent
publication. The present editor is that able
journalist, W. Lane, and Frank Barnes is busi-
ness-manager. It is the only worker’s weekly now
published in Queensland.
The average suicide, when he starts to cut
his throat, always saws with a dinner knife or
some other blunt weapon at his windpipe, and
fondly imagines that lie is killing himself, till the
surgeon comes along and sews him together again,
and the magistrate gives him three months. No
man without a knowledge of anatomy should try
to hack himself to death with a carving-knife.
For the convenience of suicides The Bulletin
desires to point out that the fatal spot is not the
windpipe but the jugular. People who can’t find
the jugular should get a friend to show it them.
The English and Australian Mortgage Bank,
one of the Melbourne land-boom institutions,
which recently stopped payment, is to be “re-
organised,” and the method of “ re-organisation ”
is as follows. A new company is to be created
which will take over the old company bodily,
with its assets, liabilities, bank premises, share-
holders, working staff, embarrassments, pros-
pectuses, bad debts, and all the rest —in fact, the
new company will be so very like the old one that
the result is much the same as if Parkes organised
himself into a new Parkes which would take over
the old original Parkes as a going concern, and
carry him on as heretofore at the same address.
All the shareholders in the former company—the
one which burst—will be also shareholders in the
re-organised institution. But .instead of paying
the depositors, these unfortunates will also be
transformed into shareholders—in other words the
bank which took their money and couldn’t pay it
back will hereafter keep their money and give
them as an equivalent a share of its embarrass-
ments, and because they couldn’t get their own
deposits back they will be compensated by being
made responsible for all future deposits. r lhis
little arrangement makes_ things comfortable for
all parties, and the bank is expected to re-open at
an early date.
Domestic interment, dla Deeming, with-
out benefit of clergy, is by no means a modern
institution. The ideaJirst suggested itself ,to the
notorious Mannings—husband and wife—who
some 45 years ago, first murdered their lodger,
a commercial traveller named O’Connor, and then
buried him beneath the kitchen hearthstone of
their house in Bermondsey, a district in the
borough of Southwark, London. After the per-
petration of the deed the murderous pair separated
and fled, each taking a, different direction as a
measure of greater security. The task of bringing
them to justice was entrusted to the brothers
Forester, the two keenest detectives of that day.
They were in due course apprehended, tried, and
executed side by side —the husband showing the
white feather, the wife game to the last. For the
purpose of this reminiscence it is unnecessary to
give the details of the male criminal’s capture,
who, when taken, tried to screen himself
by pleading that he was an involuntary accessory
after the fact, and alleging that his wife
was both the instigator and chief actor in the
crime. Her subsequent proceedings before cap-
ture, and behaviour afterwards, certainly proved
she was, at all events, made of sterner metal
than her partner, whom she reviled on
the scaffold for his > cowardice. After many
doublings and windings, one of the Foresters
struck the trail which led into Scotland, and
finally ran her to earth in Edinburgh. At this
time the Royal yacht, Victoria and Albert, com-
manded by Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence, a
son of King William IV. when Duke of Clarence,
by the celebrated actress, Mrs. Jordan, was lying
in Leith Roads, and her commander having a good
time of it on shore. The night before Mrs.
Manning’s arrest —she was, by the way, a very
handsome woman—the gallant skipper, while
doing the block, was struck by the appearance
of a fashionably-dressed lady, endowed with con-
siderable charms of person, and who appeared by
no means indifferent to his obvious admiration.
Not being by any means bashful, the noble tar
speedily struck up an acquaintance with the siren
who bad captivated him, which led to a visit to the
theatre, winding up with a champagne and lobster
supper—and all was revelry and joy. \V ithin a
day or two afterwards the A ictoria and Albeit
was in blue water, and the Bermondsey murderess,
like Eugene Aram, “ with gyves upon her wrists, ’
was on her way to London, escorted by Detective
Forester. • • • -A.t the Old Bailey on the
morning of the trial Air. and Airs. Manning
met for the first time since they had deposited
their former lodger under the hearthstone in the
little kitchen at Bermondsey, As is usual on
such occasions, the court was densely crowded,
special seats being reserved on the bench for the
upper-ten. Amongst those privileged ones were
many members of the aristocracy, male and espe-
cially female, including that gallant ruler
of the Queen’s Navee,” Lord Adolphus I itz-
clarence. While the Judge was settling himself
comfortably, and the legal gentlemen arranging
their papers during the few minutes preceding the
appearance of the prisoners in court, Lord Adol-
phus who had casually remembered his visit to
Edinburgh just before the apprehension of Mrs.
Manning, was narrating his pleasant little even-
incr’s adventure on that occasion to a friend who
sat beside him, when silence was called by the
crier, and the prisoners entered the dock—Mrs.
Manning weaving her veil clown, which, by direc-
tion of the Judge, she raised before pleading,
“ not guilty.” Absorbed in his story the hero ot
it had not noticed the prisoners particularly, but
at the 1 sound of Mrs. Manning’s voice Ins lordship
quickly looked up, and, recognising in the pruoner
about to be tried for her life his fair companion of
the theatre and supper in Edinburgh, exclaimeo,
in a tone loud enough to reach the dock, And,
l»j Jove, that's the woman!" It was afterwards said
that it was then the murderess exhibited the
only emotion she displayed throughout the trial.
Deeming told one of his doctors that after
he had contracted a certain disease he vowed that
he would kill every infected woman. Such a
motive for the “Jack the Ripper” murders was
suggested at the time by the Pall Mall Gazette ;
but Deeming isn’t “Jack the Ripper,” all the
same.
Retired hangman Berry, who has dropped
130 human beings with a sickening thud, says in
his lecture on Capital Punishment, that far more
murders are committed by insane persons than is
generally supposed. Which really me ns that a
large percentage of Perry’s 130 were so mentally
deranged that he, callous brute as he was, couldn t
help noticing it.

Now that the gods are dead—where shall we find
us a god?
Myths of the Greek Olympus have sunk in thu
surge of Time.
And Jehovah, the God of Wrath, who stayed the
sun at His nod;
And Jesus, the Nazarene, preaching a dream
sublime. _ .
Worship and form may live, practice and faith
have fled,
Where shall we find us a god—now that the godi
are dead ?
What of the Old exists but feels the touch of the
New ?
Thousands of voices shout: Where is the voice
that leads?
Thro’ the wreathing mists of night will the gray
of dawn be true,
In an age of vague unrest, strivings, and
shattered creeds ?
When the children turn with scorn from the paths
which their fathers trod—
Now that the gods are dead, where shall we find a
god ?
Gone are the myths of old in the light of the larger
day !
Gone is the foolish hope, the trust in a Power
above!
Science has swept the heavens and brushed religion
away !
What need we hope or fear? Warfare is clothed
like love !
Priestcraft is but a trade —souls can be bought
and sold !
Why should we seek for a god—now that our-
god is Gold ?
Great were the gods of Eld—a greater than all is
near !
Noblest of all the powers which ruled o’er the
soul of man !
Centuries paved the way, now the ideal is here
Product of all the sons that rolled since the
world began !
Thousands have toiled for this with sufferings
manifold.
This is the triumph of time—the god of the world
is Gold !
Worship before his feet and kneel in his holy
place,
For his altar is on the hearth and the rolling
world is his throne !
With the throb of a votary’s pulse beats the heart
of the human race.
From the lips of the child at play sounds the
creed w-e have called our own.
Gather, O, sons of men, but not like the men of
old:
Savages worshipped honour —ice have no god but
Gold.
Gather, 0, sons of men, let us kneel at the sacred
shrine !
Beauty was won by deeds —now it is bought and
sold.
was deemed of God —now it is scarce
divine !
Honour dearer than life-what is honour to
Gold?
O, daughters, sisters, and wives! Beauty was
meant to sell!
Let us call the blessing of Heaven on the marriages
made in Hell !
Over the marriage chime, and over the requiem’s
Into the’peace of heme enters the roar of the

Barter whilst day be day, ere night when no man
may buy !
Nothing too high or low in a world of culture
and art!
This is the crowning age, born of the centuries
fled ! . , '
Age of “Sweetness and Light’’—now that the
gods are dead !
Souls of the mighty dead who lived and died for
the right,
Genius inspired of heaven to battle for human
need—
These are the days of the dawn, the dawn of
diviner light, . .
When the child at its mother’s breast is lisping
the modern creed —
If haply thine eyes may gaze on th.e paths which
thy feet have trod,
Behold, in a godless age, we have sought and
found us a god !
Deep from a million throats rises the strain sub*
lime —
“ Justice is for the rich, patience is for the

Wealth is the only good, want is the only crime ;
Beauty is for the old if but the price be sure.”
Deep in n, whole world’s heart festers the cursed

heart of the vyorld.
Where is the voice of the leader? When will
the people wake ?
Nay ! let us fold our hands, Madman, what fool

Nay ! for the day draws near when all shall not

Honour shall not be bought, wealth shall not
make the man.
All have not turned away from the truths winch

All have not toiled in vain since the toil of the

All have not laid their souls at the feet of the idol

Some have remembered God-now that the gods

816 Macquarie-strcet North, Sydney, May 4, 1892,
Mr Dear Moorabinda, —
For the farewell dinner to Premier Dibbs in Sydney Town
Hall, on 29th ult., ladies’ gallery tickets were sold instead
of ghen away, and as a consequence there was but a
smattering of loveliness, at two-and-six per head.
Methinks a more picturesque result would have been
anived at had the committee dispensed with the “light
icfieshment that perambulated the balconies and
given two ladies cards to every banqueter instead.
Mayoress Manning, in a black beaded gown, entertained a
large, but seemingly official party of ladies in the northern
gallery. Amongst them was Mrs. Si dney Burdekin, in a
black silk and lace dinner-dress, with a white gardenia in
the corsage, black Spanish comb in her hair and black
opera-cloak, worked in gold, with Miss Burdekin (looking
charming in a white satin brocade, edgedwith black jet),
providentially (or was it designedly?) placed opposite to
where her fiance— Captain Helbert— was dining beside
Lord Ancrum. By the way, I wonder why men look with
such complacency at the women up aloft unless they
don t know how badly their natural thatch wants repair-
on top. Under such circumstances, Man should dine
with his hat on.
The notabilities were all starred along the off-side of the
cross-table as usual, so that everybody' got an uninter-
rupted view. A lady' helped two little children in the
southern gallery to let down to the guest of the evening
what looked like a big floral horse-collar. Unless a man
happens to be very old and bent and silver-haired and
gracious-looking, the public receipt by him of flowers
always makes him look extremely awkward; you could
see when they gave Mr. Dibbs the horse-collar, that he
thought he was expected to grin through it. The Premier
had Lord Jersey—who, when dinner he'jan, thoughtfully'
wore his striped order-ribbon very loosely—on his right,
and Mayor Manning, who was in and out of his robes like
a lightning-changist, on his left. ’Mums in funeralish
mounds formed the principal table decorations, and I hope
the menu was more artistic. But all I know is that one
man turned a fizz bottle slowly round to his neighbour
across (he way, pointed warningly to the label, and
solemnly shook his head.
I looked in at the Hotel Australia the other day to see
if the already popular Max O’Rell wore cold clay feet in
private. But at home Max O'Rcll is even more engaging
than abroad. Occupying three chairs during my visit,
and talking from what appeared to be the utmost recesses
of each, Monsieur Blouet, with his unique conversation,
kind, penetrating blue eyes, and marvellous facial play,
simply glued me to my perch.
Madame Blouet (who is English)-a tall, willowy woman
with uncommonly black orbs—seconds her husband in
graceful cordiality. When you compliment her on the
manner in which she, in translating her husband’s books
for the printer, catches the spirit of originality', she tells
you of triumphant occasions when a happier rendering
occurs to her and elevates her from a translator to a col-
laborateuse. “ Talking shop ” for a moment, it transpires
that M. Blouet cannot write at all unless in touch with his
subject, which is the reason there is no O’Rellian book in
Germany. He travelled in the Vaterland, and indeed
took copious notes, which his publishers offered him many
shekels to embody, but the task was uncongenial, and so
the notes are pigeon-holed to this day. As to the
Australian type, Mons. Blouet claims that he recog-
nised it on one occasion at least. He was on board
the s.s. Teutonic when a man entered the smokery with
forepaws dangling in the marsupial manner. “ That man
should be an Australian,” said Max, “he looks like a
kangaroo. ’ And he was ! After all, I have one small
objection to Monsieur Blouet—lie how-do-do’s in the
slow-wag-at-a-nose-high-elevation way—but possibly this
is the fatal result of taking lunch with the Governor.
Seen on the platform, the lecturer is an engaging
personality w ith a gold ring on each fourth finger, who
speaks English like a Scotch-American but with amusing
defects of pronunciation, altho’ methinks the gentleman
can pronounce our lingo correctly enough, hut is aware
that for platform purposes a little pigeon-English here
and there greatly assists the effect. For instance, when
he is serious he says “John Bull” at proper equidistance
—when he is jesting it becomes ./o/inBuII with quick
comical stress. Apart from the charm of his talkee-talkec,
the most fascinating thing about the O’Rell is his obvious
kindliness.
Perhaps the muddy streets militated against the numeri-
cal success of the first Foli concert in Centennial Hall,
hut people who missed did it in a double sense. The gal-
leries held the most loveliness. Madame Blouet, in a
black velvet dress w ith a cluster of white roses and scarlet
fan ; and Mademoiselle Blouet, wearing purple with black
jetted trimming at neck and w rists, and feather boa,
flanked some really magnificent diamonds; a pretty
society woman in a crimson plush cloak had her back
hair ostentatiously tied up with a ribbon of “ real ” man*
o’-war hat-band, given to her out of the ship’s stores by
Iter best (naval) hoy 1 suppose. A black brocade dress
with jetted edges and front and full sleeves of golden
chiffon, was very taking, hut a wild commingling of red
and yellow looked as if the wearer was on fir?.
Chi the stage Mr. Foli—a tall and well-made man w ith
grizzled but artistic hair—wielded a deep Centennial-
organish voice with consummate skill. He was encored
for all his songs, “II Monaca,” “ I’m a Roamer,” and “ I
fear no Foe,” and in response to the first recall gave
“ Father O’Flynn” with “business” to the rapture of
the groundlings ‘The great basso” articulates very
clearly, and the vice is beyond criticism, but I must say
that his habit of raising his shoulders with each breath is
not artistic, and he works his big moustache as if he were
gobbling the music. Mr. Orlando Harley, the tenor-
come-lately, was vocally lovely on the whole, but the
upper register is sometimes forced ; also, the interpolated
head-note in “You’ll remember me” spoilt the song.
Orlando isn’t a better composer than Balfo, Mrs. Van
Greene, Miss Bertha Rossow, Miss E. Woods (who made a
hash of Qottschalk’s “II Temolo ”), Barker harping on
his harp, and Lemmone tootling a bright little tarantelle
of his own completed the bill, which was a great deal
more ornamental than its surroundings. Decorations
may deaden sound but you must cede something to
appearances, and even a Foli looked all the better against
•a fern.
The first concert of Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society
under Hazon’s magnetic baton in the Town Hall, on 27th,
went off most snapfully, and the aid lent by professionals
in no w ise detracted from the glory of the amateur orches-
tration. Madame Kellerman in a handsome gown of
yellow brocade played a Fantaisie Hongroise of Liszt with
orchestral accompaniment, and was saluted with many
flowers. Lord Jersey, with the eldest daughter robed in
pale-blue, chatting composedly with Bruce Smith, formed
the centre of the semi-circle of patronage on this occasion
—the other lady in the V.R. party (who wore a swallow in
her hair) seemed hardly sure that the big committee
bouquet of pink roses wasn’t meant for her. The sight of
the evening was the agility of honorary Secretary Green,
upon whom it devolved to see the big and well-dressed
audience seated. After one of his frantic flights the
whole length of the big hall somebody suggested—“ Don’t
you think roller-skates would be useful?” The idea
struck me as an inspiration.
Lord Jersey gave away the prizes in connection with
St John s Ambulance Corps—which was energetically
floated by Lady Brassey, but went on three legs directly
she turned her back-in the Town Hall vestibule, last
triday afternoon. There was a fair attendance of meek-
looking maidens, and Lady Jersey sat on the platform in
a grey silk gown, while her lord made a speech between
two wax candles, and complained that there were not
more present. Then the meeting broke up hastily as if
its feet were damp. Vice-regal functions, Womens’
Suffrage meetings, and churches all suffer from the same
drawback—they’re so dreadfully serious.
They say, by the way, that the true explanation of so
much vice-regal seclusion from the public gaze is because
the lady suffers so. She is virtually an invalid to whom
excitement is forbidden, and there you have a charitable
explanation which is enough to make the whole female
population of Government House haunters, who mis-
understood poor, dear Lady Jersey’s motives just at first,
you know-, rush off pell-mell to the vice-regal portal with
prescriptions and advice and sympathetic tears. To be
s.'lflshly critical, however, it is quite apparent that delicate
gubernatorial help-meets won’t do at all in Australia,
w here the Governor’s w ife must pan out ever so many
more ounces to the social ton than does His Excellency.
Lord and Lady Jersey have departed for Grafton Agri-
cultural Show, under convoy of H.M.S. Lizard, lam told
that the vice-regal invitations were posted at Grafton in
a moment of thoughtless excitement, and that when the
gracious acceptance of “ We ” turned up, the represente-
tire Giaftonians didn t know where on earth they were
going to house the vice-regal party. The leading Boni-
faces wage war with the representative persons up that
way, because the r.p.’s patronise the local club, where
exhilarating gargles are sold without a license, to the
detriment of the honest publican, who, on this occasion,
was stone-deaf to the wiles of his ancient enemy, and
refused to turn out regular customers for even gilded new
ones. As a result, the men who had worked the Governor
up really didn’t know where he w'as going to lay his
golden head, when they got him. At latest advices, the
local bank premises were to be dedicated to the distin-
guished guests, but I shouldn’t wonder if it ended in the
nobbiest tent procurable, pitched under an irreproachable
tree.
Even if “Captain Swift ” at the Criterion had not been
so soothing because of Mr. Titheradge’s delightful acting,
there would still have been cause for wild pecans of praise
over the pleasant way the ladies “dressed the piece.”
Miss Temple’s first frock was top of the wardrobe—the
skirt and corselet bodice and sash of pale mushroom
coloured poplirr with full top artd sleeves of chiffon en
suite ; Pattie B. (the night I was there Lyndal addressed
her by mistake as “ Miss Pattie ” artd she, unwisely,
looked unutterable things, thereby enhancing the slip, of
course) in the first act wore a white brocade, the front
embroidered in gold, the train lined with yellow silk,
diamond ornaments ; Watt-Tanner, in a subdued grey
stripe like a repentant lizard ; and Seymour, in a hope-
lessly rubescent frock of plush and silk completed first
act frocking. In the third act Emma Temple (she should
I )>k up the pronunciation of “interesting,” by the way)
wore a pretty debutanteish frock of white chiffon with
pearl edgings; and in another phase of the pyschological
trouble Pattie 8., rigged in white muslin flowered with
forget-me-nots over a slip of pale-blue silk, looked far too
attractive for the sort of girl the Australian squatter
brings from abroad with him—l mean his wife.
It is just lovely to see the disengaged “ emotional
lead ” who has been presented with a box for the occasion
leaning back in her chair at the theatre with a superior
expression and silent palms while the rest of the house is
stamping. Take a date-filled “ leading lady ” behind the
floats and a “ recruiting ” ditto before them and the play
won’t be the only thing worth studying. Which all
reminds me, I don’t know why, that rumour attributes
gorgeous diamonds to Marie Halton, the prima donna.
Somebody saw her in a stage-box in Melbourne with
’em all on—ropes of them round her waist, arms, neck
—everywhere, and great was the effect thereof. “ She
must be worth thousands!” they say, and I sincerely
hope so, hut 1 can’t help remembering Lady Halid’s paste
substitutes and Bernhardt’s gimcracks. The paste-ridden
leading lady always makes that mistake and steeps herself
in Koh-i-noors so that her modest screw looks quite
eccentric in the garish glare of jewels that would,
genuinely, mean a very neat fortune.
The first public ball of the Sydney season ’92 will bo
held in aid of the Children’s Fresh Air League, and is to
take place on May 30th in Centennial Hall, in the presence
of Vice-regality & Co. Tickets are 12s. fid. each, and
Mrs. Mailler Kendall is honorary secretary. The School
of Industry ball—the most exclusive public charity festi-
val of the season—will not eventuate until June. Which
reminds me that the commercial travellers are going to
hold a dance this year. Rumour attributes forty good
stories to the “drummers,” thirty-nine of which are unfit
to be told in the presence of ladies. At that rate the
hosts of the occasion won’t know what to talk about.
“ Love’s Caress ” and “ Road and River ” arc the titles
of two locally produced songlets-the music by Franz
Oarna—the verse by Howard C. Coghlan. The first-named
is neatly fitted to sentimental words with a refrain very
sweet and truthful to the effect that unless you keep on
hugging without a break you might as well leave it alone.
A song like that ought to have a frantic run. The other
song appears to me a little less successful.
Says the S.M. Herald in a recent statistical outbreak
The adult population of New South Wales from 21 to 05
years of age (including the other sex) numbers 592,771.
Please, who are the “ other sex ?” Is this the new way of
naming the pioneering females who want to wear the
that is to say, to v ote?
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

At Sydney Royal the “Trumpet Call,’’
perpetrated in a moment of pitiable weakness by
Buchanan and Sims, shows no present signs of
wearing out the really superb scenery which has
hitherto lent it both backbone and muscle. The
average Sydney paper persistently compliments
the talented upholsterers of this drama with
having constructed a play in which there is neither
villain nor villainy. We go further and compli-
ment the so-called authors on the absence of
everything else necessary to the fabrication of the
ordinary drama. There is a plentiful lack of wit,
plot, passion, brightness, smartness, and aught
else beside that makes life worth living; and the
poor, poverty-stricken, pallid adumbration of a
ghost of a play, by a double-barrelled playwright,
would hardly challenge five minutes’ attention
were it not for the acting of Mr. Glenny, Miss
Kate Bishop, and Mrs. Bland Holt. The last-
mentioned is a highly-delightful and capable
mummer; her wonderful dresses are the despair
of this world and a subject of marvel to the next,
and her absolutely natural breeziness enables one
to forget the other fellow very successfully. Also
Bland Holt’s comments on the Windsor murder
have not been keeping pace with the progress of
the trial.

In “Dick Whittington,” at Sydney Her
Majesty’s, Billie Barlow, of whom we print an
excellent portrait, flourisheth as the verdant
bay-tree. In consequence of the oriental page-
antry indulged in to such expansive proportions
by the Sells’ Brothers, several additional features
are prominent in the Lord Mayor’s entry into
London, and Miss Edith Vane executes several
varieties of fascinating dance in an appreciative
stream of limelight. The trained ponies are a
feature in the show calculated to bring no end of
chastened joy to the heart of the cheap sporting-
man in the gallery, and the shirt-front of the
manager lends an air of aristocratic gorgeousness
to the glittering ensemble. N.B.—“ Little Jack

yclept “Sophia,” was staged in'all its pristine
splendour with most of the old favourites in their
old parts; Mr. Cecil Ward playing Tom Jones,
Mr. Titheradge supporting the part of Partridge,
Miss Pattie Browne that of Honor, and Mr,
Boucicault cracking the' whip of his erstwhile
Western. In the present version Mrs. Molyneux
takes the part of Lady Bellaston, formerly played
by Mrs. Brough ; but a detailed account of the
performance will be given next week.

At Sydney Garrick, the “ County Fair,”
euphemistically designated a “comedy drama,”
was revived on Saturday last. The attendance
and the mounting were a deal better than the
piece and the performance deserved ; the acting
was mediocre, but not nearly so much so as the
dialogue. This “ comedy ’’ drama was originally
staged at Her Majesty’s some time during
last year, and it is specially instructive as
being evidence of the kind of literary
pabulum that the modern Yankee enjoys. 0»f
course, Mr, Frank J. Currier is a clever exponent
of the part of xMiss Abigail Prim, and Miss Bella
Bashall manages to struggle fairly well through
the character of Taggs, but the “County Fair”
always makes us feel tired.

Max O’.Rel] opened Ids course of national
sketches •one can hardly term them lectures—on
Thursday ’,l)ist, to a house which was absolutely
crammed, lyau'/fhiur to.ceiling. Throughout the
hour and a half,' ( yr thereabouts, during which he
“lectured ” he was greeted with storms of appla USA
and riotous volumes of laughter; and this bear’
remarkable testimony to his quality as ‘ 8
“lecturer,” for a more depressing, sacerdot-u
cavern than the “ Centenary ” Hall it would b
difficult to find in Sydney. Max’s first “lecture ”
so far, is his best. His second is disappointing
His third is a trifle superficial. Max O’Kpli
knows John Bull, and knows him well. When b
sketched 1 * Sandy ”he talked Dean Ramsay. h 6
Yankee is Mark Twain as observed by the other
fellow. He is, however, no matter what or whom
he talks, crisp, keen, incisive, and—witty. Wu
rather than humour, is the characteristic of Max
O’Rell’s remarks ; when he is humorous (in thu
modern acceptation of the word) he reminds one
of America. He is, personally, a broad-shouldered
well-fed, well-dressed, well-groomed man, rather
stout, and consequently good-tempered. Likewise
his lectures are not unreasonably long.

For the past few weeks Professor Simon
has been casting his silver tea-and-coffee services
upon the waters of popular favour ; and on Mon
day last Signor Foli began a season at the Gen'
tennial Hall with results that eclipse the f atu ,.
of his pugilistic namesake, though liis managers
will have to liven up if they wish tn
make a fortune. The Polytechnic, with the
Hiscock Minstrels; the Cyclorama, with the
horrors of war ; the School of Arts, with the
horrors of farce; and the Bondi and Coogee
Aquariums, with various brands of marine
monsters perennially on tap, have continued to
hold up valiantly against the superior attractions
of the Deeming trial, with more or less success
according to the state of the weather.

Sells’ great circus opened with a farewell
season of nine nights at Moore Park on Monday
last. The rain came down with persistent viru
lence, the ground was sloppy and slippery, and
the gigantic tent spread a damp and depressing
horizon of canvas around a watery audience
Nevertheless the attendance was very good, and
the show, as usual, an ineffable success. In* fact
there is too much show about Sell’s Circus; too
much to see and hear and appreciate within the
two hours set apart for the performance. Usually
three separate displays are running abreast of each
other at one time, and the result is dazing in the
extreme. It is a very complete menagerie stuffed
with abnormally long men and long women, and
short men and short women, and bearded ladies
and snake-charmers, and elephants and hippopo-
tami, and mermaids and other specimens of that
which dwelleth on the earth and in the heavens
above and in the waters under the earth. Then
there are the Silbons, the Stirks, the Dales, the Gil-
forts, the Costellos, the Japanese and the Arabs’
not forgetting other performers whose names are
legion and whose abilities are too much for a single
entertainment. The most striking feature of the
return visit to Sydney is, however, the proficiency
of the trick and ring horses, which have all been
purchased in Australia and trained within the
past month or so, since the quarantining of the
imported stock by order of N.S.W. Government.

Melbourne shows all round have been in a
damp, depressed condition this last week. On
Saturday there was only a moderate attendance
at the Opera House to welcome a decidedly
scratch performance of “ London Assurance,” in
which nobody, from Mrs. Bernard Beere down-
wards, shone to much advantage. Mrs. B. is the
antithesis of a provincial tomboy like
Lady Gay Spanker, and the resources of art are
insufficient to overcome the fact that she is acting
a part that can be better interpreted by inferior
artistes. Royce’s “rorty” gutturals are quite
foreign to the character of Sir Harcourt Courtly,
not to mention his personal disqualifications-for
pourtraying successful rakedom in its dotage.
Dazzle, in the person of young Guy Staunton, is but
a verdant adventurer, and few of the others bring
out the best points of the comedy that Boucicault
did or did not, write. However, “London
Assurance” was to finish last (Wednesday) night,
lor the next three nights Mrs. Beere will face her
admirers as Miss Hardoastle in “She Stoops to
Conquer,” and the last week of the season is
set apart for a sequence of revivals.

Sheridan’s new version of “Conn, the
Shaughraun” doesn’t draw multitudes to the
Royal, sassiety in particular being callous to the
attractions of Irish drama. The present show is
handicapped by comparison with the past, per-
haps, and an enlightened public may prefer to
jump to conclusions respecting the relative merits
of, say, Alf. Boothman and George Titheradge in
the part of Captain Molyneaux, without going to
see what a falling off is there. Yet the folks
gathered round the emancipated “Widow” are
not all as inhuman as A.B. Oily Deering is a
first-class Harvey Duff, and Charlie Brown
deserves the honourable mention omitted from
last week’s notice. ‘‘The Shaughraun” may get
over Saturday, but his nights are unlikely to be
much longer in the land.

Business is below the usual standard at the
Princess’s, where “ Carmen ” succumbed to strest
of circumstances, on Friday last. The idea thas
“Carmen ’’ is a popular opera dies hard, but the
knell of the delusion aforesaid was sounded some
years ago. Its one striking melody is hackneyed,
and the rest of the music is not of the kind that
uneducated ears care to listen to very often.
“ Mikado ’ was revived on Saturday with a woe-
fully weak Katisha in the long, thin form of Miss
Maud Leamington, late of Sheridan’s company.
Maud was evidently alarmed at finding herself
where she ought not to have been, and all the
efforts of Vernon, Ryley, Miss Oolborne-Baber and
\ iolet V arley failed to stir up a spirit of emulation
in the “daughter-inlaw elect.” On the other
hand Allan Morris came out with unlooked-for
strength in the name-part, and made a’ decided
success. “Mikado” was advertised as for six
nights only and will probably give way to “La
Cigale ” on Saturday.

Even “ The Solicitor ” lias suffered from
bad weather and the new Victorian policy of
retrenchment. The Bijou showed a considerable
number of spaces to let in the dress-circle last

would only give it time to come out, the manage-
ment announce “Uncles and Aunts” for imme-
diate production.

At Melbourne Alexandra the local murder
drama gave place to a classic production on
Saturday. The orful crime on the hearthstone
lost its subtle charm rather suddenly, and the

up for the purpose of introducing to notice the

The manager who takes a celebrity round always does
his level best to keep him on the chain, so that nobody
shall see him without paying at the door. A great many
o eople only want to look at the great man, and if he can

asserted that the Much-Travelled Smythe has a special
dause in his contract with Max O’Rell whereby that
eminent Frenchman is forbidden to go out of doors more
than so many times a week, and the rest of the time he is
l ent chained up, or cemented under the hearthstone,
with Smythe sitting in the grate to see that he doesn’t
get out, or else he is locked up in a Black Maria and
Smythe shoots his victuals through the keyhole. Also lie

curiosity of reporters, and any person trying to interview
him does it at his own risk. These facts are given on un-
reliable authority and can be thoroughly depended on

A New York paper raves about Paderewski s wool as
follows:—" As to his hair, picture or pen can scarcely do
it, justice. It is long and soft as silk, and never disturbed
by a comb. When he awakes from sleep he runs his hand
three or four times through the mass of indescribable
hue, and lo 1 the colours scintillate brightly, and that part
of his toilette is complete. His favourite flower is the
violet and he much admires American roses. Dining and
sleeping are secondary considerations. He is music, all
music; ho has a soul.” Evidently from this Padeiewski
doesn’t wash his head when he wakes up in the morning,
and there is no mention of washing his face either. Ihe
long-haired man very seldom washes his head, however—
in fact he seldom washes at all. If Paderewski comes to
Australia it is to be hoped that Smythe will wash him, if
he won’t do it himself. The unclean musician doesn t
take well in Australia.
Comparatively new story of Jean de Reszke, operatic
star. De R. is a devoted dog-worshipper, and recently
his favourite spaniel was taken ill. For a whole day the
great tenor nursed the afflicted animal, and, at last,
towards evening it fell asleep. It was lying on the tail ot
its master’s furred dressing-gown, and he couldn t move
without waking it, so for three mortal hours de Reszke sat
bolt-upright and motionless, till he gotcrampsand couldn t
move at all. Then his valet informed him that it was
time to dress for the theatre, and that menial had to cut
off most ot his master’s clothes so as to get him away
without waking the dog. The only other alternatives
were to shake up the spaniel or to resign the engagement,
and the former, at all events, couldn’t be thought ot lor
an instant.

he say, delivered? Jude- after many warnings —left
Hobart tor Maoriland on 28th April, amid the tears and
floral offerings of a large crowd of ladies whom he had

Organist Jude’s Sunday afternoon lectures at llobait

irrelevantly about reporters “who cculdn t pay t e
board-bills,” and after stating his conviction that the man
who wrote the “ critique ” couldn’t be good to his mothei,
said he would like to have that bad young man on the

and the lady who means to make a good one had better
wait and marry on the strength of it. Other kinds of
ladies can marry any time.

A Sydney financial Co. now in liquida-
tion is being turned inside out with humorous
results. The liquidators have discovered that one
director got over .£lO,OOO advanced on smokery
security, and another operated on nearly £oOUU
similarly secured. This latter individual claimed
from the company a big sum as commission on the
sale of shares, which sum does not figure in any
of the receipts handled by the company. Directors
accounts were at once put into credit without
requiring any deposits from them. One director
had an overdraft of £4OOO converted into a credit
balance by a mere book-keeping entry. Another
director drew a cheque upon his then largely over-
drawn account to pay his municipal rates on the
very day the company suspended. Indeed, the
glorious system seemed to be— pay all directors
cheques, money or no money, and let it go to
profit-and-loss account. Many of the alleged
securities for overdrafts consisted of wild-cat
mining scrip.

Sydney press interviewer ; “ What is the

O’Reli: “ Well, there’s no love lost, that is, speak-

Argonaut, a scholarly and high-toned V ankee
paper;—
There is no nation on the globe so thoroughly hated by
Americans as is England. The people of the L n i tec ‘
States are not peculiar in this feeling. England is
regarded by nearly every other nation with either dislike
orfear. She is disliked by the great powers and feared
bv the smaller ones. She has not a sincere friend and
ally to-day. She stands alone. And it is the legitimate
result of the tortuous, selfish, and disingenuous policy
which she has invariably pursued toward other nations.
It is not probable that war will result from this Behring
Sea disuute. But if it did, England would And the

France would have something to say about English

a certain crown colony of Great Britain s, called Gibraltar

the invasion of a hostile people numbering over 60.000,000
would hasten to cut loose from the mother country.
These are hut a few of Great Britain s dangers should
Salisbury unlock the doors of the Temple of Janus. But
here is a phase of the matter which promises great comfort
to the United States. In 1858, when privateering was
abolished by the European nations, the United States
refused to sign the treaty. As we have practically no
mercantile marine, Great Britain’s navy could do us no
harm upon the high seas. But think of the rich pickings in
store for the American privateer. During the Napoleonic
wars 10 871 British ships, worth over 500 millions of dollai s,
were’ taken by French privateers. The single Breton
privateer, Surcouf, took, during two months of 1807,
prizes worth £291,250-about a million and a half of
dollars. But all this was nearly a century ago. To-day
the treasure is infinitely richer. There were registered m
1888 at Lloyd's 21,896 British vessels, sail and steam. Of
these many are the stately steamships of the Peninsular
and other great transportation companies, often carrying
great sums in specie. A navy ten times as large
as England’s could not protect her enormous. mercantile
marine. When the war was over, the United States,
which now has no mercantile marine, would have a hue
one, while England would have none.
Dear Bulletin, Father O’Sprinkhim
once raised an evil spirit with holy water. 11 was
his first tour round the western back-blocks, where
sorra a church-bell or the blessed Mass, or even a
Prodistant service, had ever been heard. Father
O’Sprinklum bumped forninst the most mis-
cellaneous lot of Christian haythenism that ever
baffled a hermit’s sight. He had to round up Ins
bush congregations with a bullock-bell, or by
banging a camp-oven with an axe-head, or tolling
a kerosene-tin with a horseshoe ; it was all one to
Father O’Sprinklum so long as he cheated the
divil of his own branded and ear-marked mob.
Ho bad to marry couples who had been hitched
for years without a sanctified word on the bond,
and who had the loosest kind of notions about
marrying “ for keeps.” He had to educate those
steady-going family-raisers up to the knowledge
that it would be sinful, after the next Christmas
racing-spree, for Flash Jimmy to ‘‘swap Ins
missus for Darby Ryan’s gurrl. And he had his
hands full of christenings. His reverence had
rounded up all the divil’s Mickeys and put the
Pope’s own brand on them, as he thought, and
had lust mounted the coach one morning on Ins
way back to less hay then parts, when word was
passed along that a dray had just brought in a
clacent couple who wanted their child baptized a
fine bhoy just rising fourteen. Ihe priest told
thim to bring the dray alongside, which they did.
’Che “infant” was fast asleep. There, by the
solemn light of the coach lantern, with a tm-dish
for the font, and the “infant” peacefully un-
conscious through fatigue, the sacred ceremony
was performed, and went harmoniously forward
without a hitch until the “pouring on” of the
water, when the infant suddenly awoke with
“ ’Fre 1 Steady on the blasted break with that

“The Bulletin’s” Portrait of the
Murderer Deeming.
Many so-called likenesses of Frederick Bailey
Deeming—now cast for death for the Windsor
(Melbourne) murder, and who is, in all human
probability, responsible also for the Rainhill
(Eng.) massacre —have been published since the
world first began to talk of this phenomenal
assassin. Most of these pictures were based, how-
ever, on photographs taken some years ago, and
few of them convey any idea of the _ present
appearance of the man. The portrait printed on
The Bulletins front page to-day may _ be
accepted as an absolutely authentic likeness; it is
an exact reproduction of the only photograph
deliberately taken of Deeming since his arrest,
and shows the murderer as he really is.
Deeming—now duly sentenced to be
hanged—made the great oratorical effort of his
life in his address to the jury. It was a
wonderful address —the cry of a strong plumber
in his agony and the statements it con-
tained were as tough as the items in a plum-
ber’s bill. Evidently the prisoner was loaded
for bear, and having been a tremendous liar and
crank all his life he kept up the character to the
last. Also, he was plainly in a tearing rage. He
complained that he had been four days in Court
exposed to the gaze of the “ ugliest race of people
he had ever seen. People glanced at his hairy
ears and other attractive features as he said this,
and seemed to conclude that he was too particular
about his society. Then he flew off the handle
and started to talk about large carnivora.
<■ I have been on the Zambesi,” he said,
“ among the blackfellows in the lions caves,
and brought the lions out. These are facts;
they are no more to me than having m,\
meals.” Whether he brought the lions out by the
hair, or whether he simply ran out and the lions
ran out after him, he didn’t explain. Then he flew
off the lions again to denounce poor Max Hirseh-
feldtas “a liar and a cardsharper,” and having
done so he cheerfully admitted that he was a good
deal of a liar himself. “I look at it in this way,’
he explained ; “let the truth be told. I have not
always boen in the habit of telling the truth rny-
self. I did not lie wilfully; it was simply a habit.
Half a dozen times out of ten I did not tell the
truth, but I could not help it.” He seemed
to regard it as quite an ordinary circumstance
that he should lie six times out of ten, but
the audience sat up and obviously wondered if
this was one of the six times, or one of the other
four. His changes of name he explained in much
the same way. “That was a habit I got into in
childhood. During my younger days, from 10 up
to about 25, I suppose I made upwards of thirty
voyages, and I never went two voyages under one
name. I don’t know why I did this. I urther
on, Deeming, as he foamed along with his perora-
tion, admitted that he had one—only one—bad
feature in his character; he was too generous to
cabmen and other low, ungrateful outcasts:
“ Another witness has stated that I gave him a
shilling to help me to convey goods from the
house. That I never did. My one fault is over-
paying people, and I gave half-crowns away instead
of shillings. I would not insult a porter by giving
him a shilling. I would give him half-a-crown.
After that the interest flagged. Everybody had
been waiting to hear some new' and thrilling
explanation about the cement, and the prisoner
kept clear of the subject. He seemed inclined for
a moment to go back and sling some more lan-
guage at Hirschfeldt, but he abstained from that
also. But he particularly requested that the
Judge wouldn’t deliver a lengthy sermon while
sentencing him, if he had any sentence to deliver,
and his desire was gratified. The Judge simply
ordered that F. B. Deeming should be hanged,
and F.B.D. retired with his hands in his pockets
and walking heavily on his short legs, a defiant
plumber to the last.

Writes an esteemed Melbourne corres-
pondent to The Bulletin
“ Williams,” with a promisin'? young crop of hair on
his face, and dressed “up to the knocker,” seemed to oner
a reasonable excuse for the ladies who loved him. His
velvet-collared Chesterfield overcoat, fitting well over the
round shoulders, didn’t make a fine bird of him, nor had
he put on a poetic demeanour with a clean shirt, but he
presented an air of money even behind the spikes. This
latter important introduction to favour, taken in con-
junction with smart, patent-leather shoes, would account
for his success in the matrimonial line. Women are
notoriously susceptible to the charm of small feet in shiny
shoes fust as they are ever ready to squeeze a hand that
carries plenty of rings on it. The difference between
“Williams” at the inquest and at the trial proper
was so striking, that one might easily have believed
the man seated in the centre of the dock to be the
serious elder brother of his old jocular self. Some-
thin" other than the fear of death had come to
disturb his diseased mind in the meantime. Not
remorse, for remorse only troubles men possessed
of strong memory power, any wily, and nobody will main-
tain that Williams, a contradictory liar on the evidence ot
his former acquaintances, had a good memory. It was
the mad theory, no doubt, that had set the wretched
prisoner thinking. His abnormal vanity wrestled with
the hazy idea that he might be mad, whilst the intei-
mittent conviction that. lunacy was Ins only loophole for
escape strove to reconcile him to hearing his sanity im-
peached by Deakin. The melancholy creature was trying
to settle, to his own satisfaction, the question whether lie
wanted to be a lunatic or a person of superior intelligence.
Probably the capacity for enjoying life has gone from
“ Williams.” if lie were set free to-morrow he would
forever afterwards keep a watch over himself to find out
where the proofs of ids madness came in.
Another white leper was admitted into the
Little Bay (Sydney) hospital last week, from
Guunedali, where lie had beenlivingforthreeyears.

POLITICAL
POINTS
There are 25 new members (and only
seven lawyers) in the new Victorian Assembly.
The betting in Melbourne is that Graham
Berry will send himself back as Agent-General,
the very first opportunity.
The latest political tvvinship of Bulcock
and M‘llwraith, in Brisbane, Q., out-coalitions
the unnatural Griffilwraith Coalition,
The Argus tries very hard to swallow
Berry, but it becomes more and more evident that
he is a bitter pill to the conservative palate.
The salary of the Chief Justice of Queens-
land (.£2500) is to be permanently raised. This in
the foreground; Sir Samuel Griffith in the dis-
tance.
Curious that John Gavan Duffy, a prime
attorney-opponent of Legal Amalgamation, should
be the first Victorian Attorney-General after its
accomplishment.
Two-thirds of the Buliraba (Q.) electorate,
recently so much in Tory evidence, consists of
freehold land; yet not nearly half the residents
own their own dwellings.
The free newspaper postage was a measure
of protection given to a N.S.W. industry by a
Freetrade Government. It will be a paradox if a
Protectionist Government takes it away.
J, C. Neild, M.L.A., “Right Worshipful
Grand Master,” boasted at Broken Hill the other
day that the Orange institution of N.S.W. repre-
sented “ 25,000ba110t papers.” How many men
According to the Worker (Brisbane),
Premier “ Griffith’s remorse’’—sapping his vitals
—“ is driving him to the grave, as every man can
see.” No ;it is driving him to the Supreme Court
Bench.
It was probably in a very thin house, of
the Commons, that a majority of but 23 decided
against Woman Suffrage last week. It was private
members’ night,. and only a small proportion
troubles to attend.
The only good point about the Queensland
system of paying Ms.P. £2 2s. per sitting was
that no legislator was allowed to exceed the total
amount of £2OO. That ensured the session not
lasting over 96 days.
The Sydney press that greedily boomed
Single-taxer Frank Cotton, M.L.A., so long as he
aimed straight against Protection, has ukased its
hirelings to ignore him now that he opposes land-
theft railway construction.
Mr. Ryan, member for the Barcoo, did
not vote on the third division of the Queensland
Kanaka Bill because he was speaking, with the
consent of his colleagues, on behalf of Mr. Fitz-
gerald's candidature for Bulimba,
A British group of West Indian islands
contains 385,000 niggers and 4800 whites. This is
what Queensland wants to come to when its popu-
lation of imported Kanakas “ provide work for
white men,” according to the gag of the Griffil-
wraith slavers.
A Nyngan (N.S.W.) paper says that M. C.
O’Halloran, one of the parliamentary candidates
for Bogan, the other day, uttered the best public
address delivered for years in that district. Now,
that Nyngan paper is understood to be owned bv
M. C. O’Halloran.
Rumours concerning Judge Lilley’s retire-
ment from the Bench now definitely place that
event at the termination of the present big
Queensland Investment Co.’s land lawsuit. It is
even asserted that the Chief’s resignation is
already in the hands of the Queensland Cabinet.
A Victorian back-blocks candidate, said
he was “in favour of having the Governor visit
the local township once every year.” We don’t
exactly know what became "of this candidate.
Probably he was beaten by another one who was
in favour of having the Governor live in the local
township altogether.
_jDear Bulletin,—Attendance at ordinary
divisions is no more a test of a member’s value to

might have been altered by his attendance?—

Treasurer See thus puts the N.S.W-
balance-sheet:—Debit: Public debt, all counted,
£51,000,000 (annual interest thereon, £2,000,000).
Credit : Value of railways, tramways and other
revenue-yielding works, £44,000,000; public works
and buildings not directly revenue-producing,
£20,000,000 ; unsold land (151,000,000 acres), sav,
£94,000,000. Surplus, say, £121,000,000.
Premier Shiels wanted Berry to join his
Ministry before the general election, biit Berry
insisted on being Premier, and also that three of
Shiels’ friends should be turned-out for three of
his; and now he has to skulk in as a favour—such
is the damnatiye bane of a title handle. You can
no more get rid of it than of the criminal tar-
brush, or the red cross on a wether's rump.
Writing on the bank’s notepaper in reply
to one who objected to his vote, a bank official
used a “ cuss” word. The recipient, thinking that
it might injure the writer, sent his letter to the
bank manager under the pretext that the signature
was undecipherable. Having seen both letters we
can vouch to the plainness of the signature, and
can only say that the objector’s action was worthy
of the body he represents.
Nearly half the votes polled by J. R.
Dickson, M.L.A., in the much-bragged-about
Bulimba (Q.) election, were polled in North
Brisbane, thus proving that Dickson represents
the dummy absentee and the plural voter. By the
way, Buckland, the late member for Bulimba, is
stated to be alive still, and not dead, as mentioned
in The Bulletin. We arc sorry about it, unless
he lias finally retired from politics.
The abolition of plural-voting must have
first place in the N.S.W. democratic programme,
in order to give the nominee Chamber a chance to
die gracefully. Bracketing together One-man-one
vote and the abolition of the Upper House,
amounts to a threat that can easily be strategically
“ bellowsed ” into a reactionary opposition which
will give fence-sitters a plausible excuse for
shelving the great question of One-man-one-vote.
The Griffilwraithians evidently regard
Ryan, the Barcoo Labour member, as a man
worth conciliating—or converting. Already he is
a. member of the House, and of the newly-appointed
Land Settlement Committees, and has been the
recipient of a deal of “wink your other eye”
praise—a far more dangerous weapon than abuse.
Ryan’s committee holds his unsolicited resigna-
tion for use at any time, but Ids head seems to be
hard and level.
The S.A. Government has found its new
plan of issuing Treasury bills locally so successful
that it has been obliged to shut down on applica-
tions, The number it originally proposed to issue
amounted to <£350,000, and the interest attached
to each <£loo worth was £4 11s. 3d. a year, or

exactly 3d. a day. These bills have a currency of
five years, and are transferable by delivery with-
out endorsement—in fact, as exchangeable (and as
easily stolen) as ordinary bank-notes.
It is unfortunately true, as pointed out by
the Queensland bogus “ Patriotic ” League, that
Sir George Grey is in favour of coloured labour
for Northern Australia. It is also true (but
not pointed out by the “Patriots”) that Grey is
in favour of work done by blacks being paid for
ait the same rate as that done by whites. For
instance, from 1815 down he had a great deal of
street-work performed by Maoris in Auckland.
For this work the aborigines were paid at white
rates, the only unusual stipulation in their con-
tract being that they should wear trousers.
The Queensland Ministry, having started
to live riotously off the country’s inheritance and
pass on the consequences to posterity, is resolved
to keep up the process. This month 164,000 acres
are to be sold, and 400,000 more are to go in June,
and after that, in all probability, the monthly
land-sale will become a fixed institution. By dint
of land-sales and loans the Griffilwraith Govern-
ment can just manage to crowd through. By-and-
bye there will be no more land to sell, no more
loans obtainable, and all the old loans to bo repaid
out of revenue, and then there will be chaos.
KanakilgrifTs Supreme Court Bill, quietly
slipped through both Q’sland Houses during the
recent “snap” session, is worth watching. It
provides that no judge can sit on an appeal from
bis own decision and co-ordinates the powers of
the Northern and Southern judges. This means
amongst other things that the Chief Justice will
be debarred from sitting on an inevitable appeal in
tlm Queensland investment eases, mb Juiive, in
which MTlwraith and Palmer are defendants,
and it means also the introduction into the case
of Chubb and Cooper, the Northern element.
The Kanaka slave-trade is the Griflilwraith-
ian quack solvent for all Queensland’s present
troubles. If Sir Charles Lilley chooses to resign the
Chief Justicesliip and to load a new democratic
party he will prove to be the acid re-agent that will
send that pretended alkahest into spuming effer-
vescence, and will precipitate with the useless
residuum the disturbed Griffithitesat present held
in solution in the alkalescent coalition scum.
Lilley’s presence in the political arena would
evoke scores of democratic champions into active
demonstration, and would change the entire
aspect of the political surface of Banaualand, the
province just re-sold into slavery.
Dear Bulletin, —I, a white man who
works, find myself politically disfranchised. I
have lived and voted m one district of N.S. Wales
for some years, but had the misfortune after last
shearing to go prospecting in New England during
the slack times. I spent 10s. for a miner’s right
and parted with .£25 in the endeavour to open up
something to benefit myself (and incidentally the
country) without robbing anybody in any way,
and now, like hundreds of others, I merely
because necessity forced me to change my place
of residence —have lost my civil rights, as in other
countries a felon does when convicted of crime.
Such is the refined cruelty and gross injustice of
the N.S.W. electoral laws. — Gumleap.
Poor Jack Gardiner, ex-member for foot-
ball in the Vic. Assembly, can scarcely believe,
“as it were,” that he is the same man who was
drawing £GOO a year from Victoria two short
years ago. Jack was “the genial whip” under
Gillies, Now he only “whips the cat ” at the
bottom of the Carlton poll.
The Victorian Ballot Act makes no pro-
vision for the sudden insanity of a returning officer
on polling day, and the Crown Law office
is flabbergasted as a consequence. Simpson,
the officer in charge at Camberwell, became
deranged without the slightest notice about 6 p.m.,
and after giving two or three cheers for nothing in
particular he started to hand six ballot papers to
each man whether he had an elector’s right or not,
and to urge those who had voted to go in and vote
again, and then he got worse and offered the ballot-
papers by handfuls to everybody, and threw his
official documents wildly and recklessly into the
air. It ended by a policeman closing the poll at
6.33—half an hour before the specified time—and
ejecting the deranged returning officer. A lot of
voters were thus disfranchised, the election is
obviously illegal, and no one knows how to make
it legal.
No one expected that William Henry
Bligh O’Connell would not easily secure re-election
for Musgrave, Q. He was returned by a majority
of 250 votes over the Labour candidate. Gin Gin
(M'llwraith’S station) is the political centre of the
Musgrave (old name, Mulgrave) electorate, and
O’Connell naturally polled the full cattle-squatting
vote. As a Kanaka advocate, he got the united
support of the sugar-planters. All the trimmers
went on his side as being a Government supporter
and probable good log-roller. Many of the
white workers who have votes in Musgrave have
had to wander afield to look for work; of those
who remained at home, many were induced
to vote for O’Connell because they were threatened
with being refused work “ when we get
Kanakas ”if they didn’t; other legitimate voters
had been duly “purified” off the roll, and the
slave contingent held all the trumps in their own
hands. O’Connell (a nephew of the late Sir
Maurice O’Connell) is a good-looking, ox-eyed
man of forty, with a ginger bias in his beard ; and
has graduated socially from being an aesthetic
bank-clerk to storekeeping and parliament—from
which he retired lately owing to private difficulties.

One Mrs. Hadfield, of Christchurch (MIL.),
has a curious case on hand. Her late husband
settled upon her a sum of <£2ooo, which was
invested in certain debentures. Then, for some
unexplained reason, Mr. and Mrs. Hadfield asked
the trustees to hand back the debentures, Mrs.
Hadfield promising to make things right with the
trust by transferring some land—in other words
they were to swap the land for the debentures!
The trustees gave the debentures to Mr. Hadfield
but Mrs. Hadfield didn’t transfer the land. Then
Mr. Hadfield died, and his widow took over all
his property, and then sued her trustees for her
■£2ooo. They say that she has already got it
because it was absorbed in the husband’s estate,
and she inherited the estate; and she says that
has nothing to do with the case. Therefore the
trustees, acting on her account, proceeded to sue
her, in her capacity as executrix of her husband’s
estate, to recover £2OOO, so that they may pay it
back to her in her own capacity—in other words,
Mrs. Hadfield, through her trustees, is, in one
capacity, suing herself in her other capacity, or,
to make it more distinct, thelady sues her trustees,
and her trustees sue her, and she sues herself. If
she wins the case she will come out in triumph in
one capacity, and find herself weeping on the
pavement outside in her other capacity, and then
she will probably get enraged at seeing herself
enjoying her own misfortunes, and will rush at
herself and tear her hair, and the police will
separate her with difficulty, or else she may rush
in, in her character as a trust fund, and separate
herself, in which case it is just possible that both
of her will turn upon her and rend her, and the
whole three of her will have to be removed to the
hospital. Again her trustees, acting for her in one
capacity, may recover costs from her in her other
capacity, and if the other capacity happens to be
dead broke they may have to pay the first
capacity and not be able to recover anything from
the second, in which case they may be" badly left.
Further, if the lady can only make sure, in
advance, which is going to win, she may deliber-
ately go and expensively enjoy herself in the
capacity that is going to lose, and “blew” all
the property, so that there will be nothing left, and
then—but the subject is getting too intricate, and
moreover the writer of this paragraph has just
chased himself down the street.

A Good Thing.
W hen a medicinal preparation claiming public
attention has stood the test of time, and from the
first has proved to be a phenomenal success where-
ever introduced, it is only natural to conclude
that it possesses a high degree of intrinsic value
as a remedy. In the absence of such a recom-
mendation any amount of persistent advertising
would not alone give it continued life.
Warner’s Safe Cure has been thirteen years
before the people of the United States, and seven
years among the inhabitants of Australasia and
New Zealand. Its inherent virtues fully account
for its acquired fame as an absolute specific in
complaints of the liver and kidneys and the
innumerable symptoms and complications arising
therefrom, while its curative power is as distinctly
apparent to-day as ever it has been during its
remarkable career. It has blessed, and is still
blessing, thousands. The amount of misery it has
been the means of removing or preventing is
incalculable—greater in degree, probably, than
has been exerted by all the other remedies (so
called) placed before our suffering race put
together. It is greatly to be deprecated that the
afflicted should be led astray by nostrums of no
permanent worth although professedly equal to
the herculean task of curing—and that out of one
bottle—all the diseases of modern times. The
utter impossibility of such a feat being accom-

The Burdetfc-Coutts marriage of ten years
was a young and blushing function compared
with the “engagement” between Mrs. Ingrain,
widow of the Illustrated London IS ews founder,

The much-tattooed Tawhiao, the Maori
King, turned up recently at Auckland (M.L.) a
sadly decayed potentate and looking very old and
poor and wretched. He wore the same stove pipe
hat, looking like a once-grey concertina, which ho
used to sleep in during his visit to London years
a°-o. Also he had on a tweed suit garnished with
mud about the feet, a pair of misfit boots without
blacking, a crumpled shirt-front, a pipe, a deranged
collar, and a torn umbrella. In days gone by the
Government used to send a cavalry escort or at
least a band of music to greet the Maori monarch,
but these times are vanished. Nobody pays any
attention to the old man now.
Some years ago a man named Dyer was
convicted at Auckland (M.L.) on the clearest evi-
dence of an atrocious murder. He had saturated
his paramour with kerosene, set fire to her, and
afterwards relenting somewhat, threw her into a
creek. The woman with her last breath endea-
voured to shield her murderer. The Anglican
Bishop Cowie tallest and perhaps the hand-
somest of Australasian ecclesiastics- who attended
Dyer before the execution, was asked subsequently
if he considered the woman had prejudiced her
chance of salvation by her falsehood. “It is not
for us,” replied the Bishop, “to say what is the
limit of divine mercy. The woman lied, and died
lying, but, sir ” (raising his voice in an enthusiastic
crescendo ) “it was a magnificent lie.”
Baron Grant, the whilom London mil-
lionaire, has sunk to a low ebb. Summoned for
the rent of a paltry little office, he was unable to
pay. He caused the downfall of The limes as a
financial organ. Sampson, city editor, attacked
one of Grant’s companies, and Grant proved
Sampson a stock-dabbler. Apropos, the magni-
ficent marble staircase, ordered by Grant for his
mansion, was afterwards bought by lussauds for
their waxworks. When Grant was ennobled by
some German potentate, a memorable epigram
was written in England :
A king may titles give but honour can t
Title without honour is a barren grant.

-\t the annual corroboree of the Australian
Shearers’ Union, the other day the authorities
intimated that they were unable to state the
amounts at the credit of all of their branches.
Whiteley King, the secretary of the opposition
cvclorama —the Pastoralists’ Association-who at
the time had a copy of the balance-sheets of every
branch in his possession, published the figures in
last issue of his association s oigau. ___

James Hemsworth, of Rockhampton, has
absconded from custody, and is now a lost leper
wandering loose about the country and shedding
contagion as he goes. The local police say they
“ can’t get the slightest clue to his whereabouts.
Probably if they wait long enough he will turn up
in the Rockhampton water supply.
Dr. Cockburn, ex-Premier of S.A., was
delivering a lecture on “The Friends of Demo-
cracy,” at the Democratic Club, Adelaide, when
a man in the crowd suggested the name of The
Bulletin. “Yes, The Bulletin, the one genuine
and consistent democratic paper in Australia,
s.iid the lecturer.
Messrs. Colemane and Co., the eucalyptus
oilmen, of Cootamundra (N.S.W.), offer a prize
of a gold medal (value <£lo 10s.) for the artist who
shears the largest number of sheep by hand in
eight hours any time during the shearing season
of 1892 ; also, a silver medal (value £5 55.) for the
largest number shorn in eight hours with the
machine. A certificate, stating the number which
the competitors has recorded, to be signed by the
shed-manager and the shearers’ representative,
and sent in to the editor of the Hummer (Wagga)
before Ist January next. A great opportunity
for deciding the relative merits of the machine
versus the live-meat shearer here presents itself.
One Bonder, of Paris, lias proved himself
a more original assassin even than Deeming.
Bonder’s wife disappeared in 1889, and he reported
to the police that she eloped after making an
ineffectual effort to poison him. The story passed
muster till a few weeks ago, when, for some reason
or other —probably through information received
from the woman next door, who had heard shrieks
on the night of Madame Bonder’s disappearance—--
the police searched the house, and found the
naked body of a woman hanging head-downwards
in the chimney. It had beemthere for three years,
and was completely dried by heat and smoke.
Editor Bulletin, —The N.S. Wales Pas-
toralists’ Union must be in a bad way, financially,
when they call upon the shearers to lend them
some £20,000. more or less, for from three to six
months. That is what the condition in their
advt.—“ That each applicant for a ‘stand’ must
lodge £l, to be held by the P.U. till the comple-
tion of the shearing ” —amounts to. It is prepos-
terous to suppose that the shearers will.subsidise
their would-be oppressors. If the P.U. desires
further warfare, it is going the right way to get it,
and if the shearers revolt this year they will only
do so for some strong reason, and all former
“troubles” will fade into insignificance before
those to come. Mr. Whitely King will not, I
think, be allowed again to pour into the western
districts the scum of Sydney, whose presence last
year caused the police to out patrols along
the roads to protect the residents from their
ravages. A little moderation now may save
months of trouble and many thousands of Pounds
expenditure in the near future.— \ ours, H.K.B.
Redbank, Bourke, April 20, 1892.
A correspondent writes : —Re your par. of
last week concerning Edward Wilson, late of the
Argus. I knew him well. He was unmarried,
and was one of a large family of brothers who
successively ran a large linen warehouse at 159
Mew Bond-street, London—it is still being carried
on by a nephew of his under the title of Wilson
and Co. For years before his death he rented a
place in Kent, which was once the seat of Pitt,
the Earl of Chatham. The writer once visited
him there, and was recommended by the hospit-
able Wilson to go to Australia, get a large
caravan, stock it with fowls, and travel over the
western plains, turning out the fowls daily to feed
on grasshoppers and other insects. “ This, if
properly carried out, 55 said Wilson, would ensure
a good living to a man.” He was very much in
earnest about the project, saying that he had often
thought of trying it himself as an experiment
before he left the country. He had in the hall of
his house a very large barrel-organ, on which he
used to grind out “Awake, my Soul!” in very
quick time every morning to awaken his guests.
What People Say.
\V. H. ROTHERY, ESQ., MELBOURNE
FACTORY INSPECTOR
Writes from the Parade, Ascot Vale I have
much pleasure in stating that X have taken
Clements Tonic, with good results. I had the
influenza, and a racking cough, clammy sweats,
which caused great weakness and nervousness.
After taking three bottles, the cough and clammy
sweats left me, my appetite improved and the
pains in my chest have been removed, lo all who
suffer I would strongly recommend Clements
Tonic.” Mr. Rothery’s case would undoubtedly
have ended in consumption had it not been for the
timely use of this remedy.
CHUDLEICH H. GORRICK, ESQ., 21
Bolton Street, Newcastle, N.S.W.,
Writes “ I think it my duty to add my testi-
mony to the efficacy of Clements Tonic. I go m
for pigeon shooting very extensively, and I find
Clements Tonic a wonderful invigorator of the
system, strengthening and steadying the nerves
and eyesight, and attribute much of my success at
the traps to the use of this remedy, and advise my
confreres to use it.

Society
Tlie delightful “ sassiety ” females rolled
up and jumped the front seats on the first day of
Deeming’s trial, and sat out a mass of extremely
delicate medical evidence, without looking in the
least uncomfortable. The prisoner looked up at
them and blushed. He had a right to : of course,
it was no trial to them.
* * «
According to Attorney Lyle there is a man
going about Melbourne in murderer Colston’s cast-
off clothes. Colston lef this wardrobe to his lawyer,
and the latter gave one suit to a dead-beat who
parades the streets in the pants which Colston
may have worn when he butchered the Narbethong
couple—that is, if he hasn’t heard the truth and
sold his suit to a waxwork syndicate.
# * #
What shall he done with Deeming's house,
in Andrew street, Windsor, Melbourne? Of
course, the owner of anything in Anderra-street
must be a Scotch presbyterian. Weel, hand it
ower to the kurruk, and raflle it at a releegious
be- zaw, for a manse.
# * *
Apropos of the mad-doctoring examination
of Deeming. In a heavy London will-case of a
few year ago, evidence as to testator’s insanity
was tendered. Counsel, examining a medical
witness, asked him if he had read “Stobel on
Insanity.” “Yes,” replied .the doctor, who, on
being questioned further, evinced the greatest
familiarity with the work and its theories. Then
the counsel quietly informed the Court that there
was no such work in existence.
* # #
When Missßounsevelle, Deeming’s escaped
bride, was behind the counter in a Brisbane book-
shop, one customer asked for “Bacon’s Novum
Organum.” “We haven’t got it. Nobody has it.
It is not asked for once a year in Brisbane.
Take the ‘ Kreutzer Sonata ’ instead. I’ve sold
500 copies in two days. Ladies are my best
customers, because they have more time to read
than men, I suppose.” She was quite right about
the “Novum Organum.” It was unobtainable in
Brisbane, and the shop assistants, when asked for
it, generally replied, “Oh, we haven't yet received
Zola’s latest.” Some of the Brisbane book-shop
employes murmur these words in their sleep.
Such slaves are men to habit!
* # #
The Bulletin would like to come to a
definite arrangement with regard to Deeming’s
eye. The colour of Deeming's eye has hitherto
been left to the caprice of newspaper reporters,
and each reporter seems to have a different
caprice. One paper considered that the gentle-
man cast “a cruel, snakelike glance around the
court,” and another publication pinned its faith to
“ a hard, stony glare.” Sometimes he fixed a
“wicked green eye ” upon a witness, and that was
good enough to swear by until the reader picked
up a different report of the proceedings and found
that the same witness was subjected to “ the
prisoner’s steely gaze.” There has been no getting
at the truth concerning Deeming’s optic, anyway.
Each observer gave a different description to the
rest in the first instance, and then seized the next
opportunity to alter his views on the subject. For
instance, the Age of April G found Deeming
to be “ a round-shouldered, undersized man
with piercing grey eyes and a granite
jaw.” That was at the inquest. But the
Age of April 2i), reporting Deeming’s first
appearance in Melbourne Criminal Court,
remarked that this “deep dark-blue eye was full of
intelligence.” Unfortunately, the writer forgot
to mention whether the granite (which is usually
grey) jaw of three weeks ago had changed to blue-
stone in sympathy with the inconsistent eye. He
didn’t forget to state that the prisoner was “ pale
and nervous,” also, that “every vestige of his old
swagger had gone, the sardonic smile had disap-
peared.” Which was an interesting change from
the opinion of the Standard’s special reporter,
who considered Deeming’s manner “confident and
jaunty.” But it is with the vexed question of the
eye that The Bulletin is chiefly concerned. We
can’t let Deeming die with his “glim ” involved in
doubt and mystery. Before the hangman works
God’s will upon this remarkable lunatic the ladies
must know for certain the tint of that witching
orb. Deeming’s eye, then, is of a carroty-grey
colour, glassy rather than piercing, large rather
than small, and sufficiently wild at times to
make one believe that the owner has several bees
in his bonnet.
* # #
• George Ashton, The Bulletin artist,
coming out of Melbourne Criminal Court last
week, was seized hold of by a culchawed looking
female with a genteel smile, who wanted the loan
of his ticket. For two solid hours she had been
dodging around doorways and importuning police-
men in vain, until at last she discovered that
admission to Williams was by ticket only. For
the resli of the day she devoted herself to the
pursuit of everybody who seemed to have a free
pass, and when G.R.A. came along he was sur-
prised to find a pale, delicate lady requesting him
to stop outside whilst she presented herself at
court with his bit of pasteboard. Her tale was
very melting. She had come all the way from
N.S.W. to see Williams, and now that there were
only two or three doors between herself and the
hero of her dreams the cruel policeman wouldn’t
put her through. What was she to say to the
friends who had made her promise to send along
an account of Williams ? It was a painful conun-
drum, and the artist fled. A wild, despairing
cry of “Just one look !” followed his retreating
form, and he turned round to see the fair pilgrim
from Parramatta weeping like a willow in a

The identification of the late Mrs. Williams
by a female witness who had seen her for about 15
seconds in the flesh was the most gruesome joke in
the Windsor murder evidence. There was no hair
left on the corpse’s head, and most of the features
had disappeared when this witness was taken to
the morgue, and asked to recognise Mrs. Williams.
And this inspired female swore to the victim like
a good ’un. She couldn’t swear to the vanished
tresses, or be positive about the colour of the
closed eyes, but she took oath that the corpse’s
face was “small and round”—exactly like poor
Mrs. W.’s.
* * *
Melbourne Standard has reached the
apex. It publishes a suggestion that Williams
is a vampire, and accounts for the fact that there
were no blood-stains in the Windsor house by the
theory that the murderer lapped up all the gore !
* * #
By the way, the Standard published a
picture of the skull of Deeming’s Windsor victim
one day last week. It did not, for a wonder, boast
of the excellence of the likeness.
* # *
A brainy paper will shortly be read before
the Victorian Institute of Journalists on “Jour-
nalism and Justice,” with special and severe
reference to the Deeming case.

So carefully was the crowd at the Deeming
trial limited that sitting accommodation for nearly
a hundred people was unoccupied in the “pit”
THE “FAIR” SEX.
MINNIE (at the trial) : “After all it seems a pity to have to hang him,”
behind the dock. The “masses” were kept
religiously out and w r ere shoved away from all the
doors. The “bong-tong” (save the mark!) got
their passes and sat it out in the specially reserved
side galleries.
# # *
Such an eye for anything with a skirt and
a fringe as Deeming’s was assuredly never known.
At the trial, while a witness was describing the
fearful discovery in 57 Andrew-street, the accused
was winking and grinning at an auburn-haired
enchantress whom an obliging policeman had just
showed inside the door for a minute. Frederick's
right eye has in it a world of the wickedness that
women like.
* # #
Deeming’s requests to his counsel for a
word or two through the bars during the trial
were very frequent. Forlongo responded every
time, and then returned to tell Deakin, and the
two would laugh together in evident enjoyment.
* # #
The canary that sang a “ sweet dirge ” at
the Windsor inquest didn’t warble at all at the
trial. The blow that Deeming aimed at its new
owner, Solomons, is said to have knocked all the
music out of it.
# # #
Deeming should be known as “ The Mad
Masher.” In court, last week, he was dressed like
a rich doctor, black frock-coat, dark pants ; high
collar, red tie with diamond pin, patent leather
button-up boots. He sat nursing each leg altern-
ately, and eyed his shiny extremities approvingly
from time to time. His beard, still short, had
grown thick, and almost concealed the hard,
square jaw and thin lips. The “dress circle”
ladies came in for frequent smiles from him, and
thereupon every one of the idiotic “ helpmeets for
man” actually hugged themselves with delight
and grinned at each other openly. The writer
fancied that Frederick gazed at Ins Katie when
she looked in to bo identified for a minute on the
first day, as if she were worthy of observation
simply as a curiosity, as a woman who had actually
escaped him. _ But Kate—she’s pretty, but it’s b
no means an intelligent face—clad in dark blue
bird’s-eye and coquettish jacket with dark hat,
and no flowers this time, kept her back scrupu-
lously turned upon her would-be lovin’ ’ubby.
# # #
It is asserted that the N.S.W, railway
commissioners propose to run special excursion
trains to Melbourne on the day that Deeming is
hanged. Even a hanging has to be looked at in a
purely business aspect in these hard times.

The Sydney coroner hasn’t added any
lustre to his official reputation by his peculiar
charge to the jury in the case of “De Wayne,”
against whom last week a jury found a murder
verdict. De Wayne may be guilty enough, but
up to date there is no more legal evidence against
him than there is to connect the Russian emperor
with the Rainhill massacre.
» * #
“ Professor ” De Wayne aforesaid,
caused a slight social sensation by attempt-
ing the “ Bertrand bluff.” He handed
into court a score or more letters, chiefly
from “ sassiety ” women, addressed to “Mrs,
Dale, ” his wife, and all having reference
to a certain alleged “ American remedy,” the
secret composition of which was supposed to be
known only' to Mrs. Dale. The names and
addresses of, and the enquiries made by the cor-
respondents caused considerable consternation in
many Sydney dovecotes, and it was hinted that
the Professor has a few hundreds more of similar
telltales up his sleeve.

Editor Bulletin, —Apropos your recent
reference to Thomas Griffiths Wainwright, artist,
art-critic, and poisoner, friend of Charles Lamb,
Talfourd, and the elder Hazlett, and who gave
Charles Dickens the motif for his short and thrill-
ing tale “ Hunted Down.” As you have not heard
of any of Wainwright’s artistic work being
extant in Tasmania, where he ended his days as a
transported convict, it may interest you to know
that in 1840, at Hobart Town General Hospital,
Wainwright painted a marvellously true likeness
of my father, which I have in my possession at
the present time. A gentleman who stands high
as an art connoisseur saw it when visiting my
house last year, and though knowing nothing of
the except’onal accuracy of the likeness, pro-
nounced it to be a great labour. —Yours, E. Hop-
kins. Launceston, Tas., 25th April, ’92.

Editor, Bulletin, — Re your Wainwright
paragraph. I beg to say that we have in our

purchased by him from Mr. Benjamin Deutro, or
a Miss Perrigle (both long since deceased); but
there is nothing on the drawing to show that it
was Wainwright’s work. —Yours, &c., A. P.

The possibility of Princess May capturing
Clarence’s brother was hinted at in The Bulletin
several weeks ago. The hint was founded on
Court intelligence that May had been knitting
something or other for the convalescent George.
Now, when a girl begins to knit for a feller, she
usually means business,
Melbourne Heuald calls for a universal- cheer
over the announcement, and quotes the precedent
of Princess Marie-Dagmar of Denmark, whose
first royal sweetheart died before their marriage,
and who then married his brother and subse-
quently became Czarina. On the question of
taste involved, the Heuald is of opinion that
“ the arrangement is a very reasonable and proper
one.” Perhaps—for princes! But if George
Jonesmitli hurriedly snapped up the surviving
flame of his defunct brother Albert Jonesmitli,
the Heuald would probably glare at the contract-
ing parties and opprobriously gasp that the inci-
dent was positively indecent. Apropos , there is
not an orthodox Tory paper going that will not
virtuously excuse, if not valorously advocate, tha
morganatic marriage of royal prmcelets; but if
Coster Joe contracted such an alliance, in addition
to the “regular thing,”he would be held up to
contumely as a degraded, adulterous beast and a
shocking example of the horrible possibilities of
the unhanged lower orders.

Apropos a recent much-discussed Mel-

been on visiting terms with the big defaulter

Judge “jugs” his ex-pal as calmly as the surgeon
scrapes the heart of his deceased friend at the post-
mortem.

According to Miss Hogg, president of the
Sydney Women’s Christian Temperance Union,
she and her female colleagues arc canvassing the
barmaids, whom they are endeavouring to convert
to the adoption of “ some more womanly occupa-
tion for a livelihood.” Without pausing to
analyse the “womanliness’’ of various other
occupations gloried in by the W.C.T.U. — c.g.,
type-writing, clerking, telegraphy, canvassing,
needlework sweating, charing, baby-farming,
nursing, &c., &o. —Miss Hogg may fairly be asked
what she has to offer barmaids in exchange for
the voluntary abandonment of their present means
of livelihood? The alternative will need to be
better paid and surrounded by easier conditions
than the great majority of the feminine billets of
to-day.
Consider the barmaids, how they grow!
An average barmaid is paid 255. per week whli
first-class board, and more or less comfortable
lodging ; a wage that is far more than equivalent
to £2 a week. She is treated by her customers as
an equal, she serves, as a rule, a master and not a
mistress, which is, in her opinion, worth
another pound, and is always respectfully, not
to say reverentially, approached. If she is
at all attractive, and an unattractive barmaid is
a rarity, there are plenty of men —and not
necessarily bad men, either —who would go heart-
broken if not permitted to bestow on her
many useful presents which materially lessen
the drain on her purse. In addition, she
stands a better chance than any other
originally unknown and uninfluential girl, who is
obliged to earn her own living, of contracting a
comfortable and occasionally a splendid marriage.
Moreover, there can be no more “womanly”
occupation than the serving-out of refreshments
to males, as every amateur-waitress sister at a
“Methody” bun-fight, or Church of England
“treat,” or Presbyterian “soiree,” distinctively
Upholds in her own person by choice of official
scrambling. It will take a whole herd of Miss
Hoggs to abolish barmaids.
Speaking of the “board’* Of barmaids, reminds
one that it is the custom of more than one large
Sydney establishment which employs female
labour, and gives it daily “meals,” to contract
with big hotels, butchers, restaurants, etc., to buy
up “ pieces i.e., the surplus remnants—at a
cheap rate. These “ pieces ” are hashed up to
feed the female hands (and males), so that those
who follow Miss Hogg’s “more womanly ” occu-
pations, actually have very often to “ eat the
leavings ” of the barmaids.
And here is an aspect of the barmaid question
which probably never struck the feminine phil-
anthropist engaged in the work of “ redemption ” i
the barmaid, the genuine, clever, capable woman
of business who purveys drinks over a bar instead
of ribbons over a counter, silks ill a show-
room, or cigars and cigarettes, is not the womah
who would willingly relinquish a trade or service
in which her real business aptitudes find full
scope and free play for the cheerless and brainless
office of a poorly paid mechanical drudge or an
official machine. A good deal of brain comes
into operation in the profession of the really
expert barmaid, and nobody relinquishes the
pleasures of the exercise of braiif-power who has
once tasted it.

St. Andrew’s Church (Presb.), Sturt-street,
Ballarat, stands directly opposite St. Patrick’s
(R.C.). They were simultaneously in course of
erection, and one morning after a very windy
night, a portion of St. Andrews was found blown
down, while its rival opposite hadn’t lost a stone.
The late Rev. Win. Henderson, then pastor of the
mutilated edifice, was calmly surveying the wreck,
when Dean Moore (now R.C. Bishop of Ballarat)
came along, and with a merry twinkle in his eye,
remarked : “ Well, Mr. Henderson, so your
church couldn’t stand the storm ! Don’t you
think it is a sure sign that my faith is firmer than
yours?” “It’s nae sign at all,” retorted the
serious Scot, “it’s only anither verification o’ the
auld adage, that * the Deil always tales care of his
aim’ ”
And here is another : When Archdeacon Slat-
tery, of “the free and flashing sword,” was plain
Father Slattery, of Daylesford, he kept a pony.
One morning he found it dead, and during the day
a certain Wesleyan minister accosted him with ;
“ So you’ve lost your pony, Mr. Slattery ?” “ Yes,
I’m sorry to say,” answered his reverence.
“ Never mind—l’m sure it must be a consolation
for you to know that he must be in Purgatory
now,” sarcastically said the other. “ No, he isn’t
there,” responded Slattery, “for I’m sorry to say
he turned Wesleyan before he died, and he must
certainly be in II —1 by now.”

Out in Western N.S.W. there are a very

other with an awful detestation. Therefore, the
one publishes occasional paragraphs stating that

last outburst of the thin editor runs thus: —“A
fat journalist has the paltriest of minds. ‘ A

different to a dead Newfoundland dog.” The

The sale of actor George Anson’s library
was a very fair success, and several hundreds of
his admirers now own a volume or two apiece as
souvenirs of the departed comedian, and proudly
show them to their friends on every possible occa-
sion. Most of them paid stiff prices for these
souvenirs, and a great many of the books belong
to the unutterably dreary order of literature, and
seem to suggest that Anson was fond of buying up
unsaleable publications, and that his reading was
of a very solemn order. Also, a rumour is abroad
that the deoarted funny man only possessed eleven
tattered volumes altogether, but that his name was
somehow lent to an auction whereby somebody
traded off all his refuse stock at 18 times as much
as it would have fetched under any other condi-
f ions. Possibly there is nothing in the story, and
it certainly doesn’t matter if there is. People
bought Anson’s books mostly in order that they
might tell in after years how that popular actor
was their best and dearest friend, and how he
gave them the volumes before leaving as a sign
that he would never forget them ; and whether the
books were Anson’s, or whether the owners only
think they were, or whether they only say they
think so when they don’t think it at all, is very
much the same.

A “respectable” press has struck a con-
vincing reason for dispatching the immortal
Williams. He looks pale and anxious, “ his
demeanour has undergone a total change,” he
appears to realise his position—and therefore he
can’t be an epileptic, can’t suffer from a horrible
disease in the third degree, and entertain hallu-
cinations. The assumption is, then, that if we
take a partial lunatic from a healthy roving life
and handcuff him in a dungeon, and tell him he’ll
be hanged “assureas God made little apples,” he
will begin to put on flesh and present the general
appearance of a person who doesn’t care a button
about what’s going to happen next.
Probably the funniest and certainly the

Dear Bulletin, —Miss Rose Scott, of
Sydney Women’s Suffrage League, is apparently
a lady who hasn’t been furnished with much
originality. In her recent deliverance she thuds
down the hackneyed text, “What a man sows
that also shall he reap,” as a conclusive evidence
against divorce, and plainly regards it as settling
the whole subject. In reality it has nothing what-
ever to do with the subject, only a race of cast-
iron religionists have quoted the utterly irrelevant
saying so long that they are incapable of realising
the fact. If the text read, “ What a man sows
that also shall his wife reap,” it would have some
bearing on the case, but it doesn’t. Miss fecott s
hunk of Scripture is really a powerful argument in
favour of divorce. Under the old order of things
any man might sow ill-usage and brutality, but he
didn’t reap anything. Nowadays—in Australia,
at least —he does reap something occasionally in
the Divorce Court. This is the only chance of
being fulfilled that the Scripture has had since the
days when there first was any Scripture. litus

Those worthy Christians who feel shocked

There are signs now, even in England,
that General Booth is a hopelessly fallen idol.
No one knows exactly how it happened, but he
went away on his tour round the world amid the
frantic hoorays of a whole excited nation, and he
came back in a dead silence of utter, wretched,
unfeeling indifference. There was no public
demonstrations except from the Army itself, and
though it thrashed its drum to rags and flinders,
and blew the bowels out of its cornet, and put
both fists through its frantic tambourine, nobody
paid any attention. The people who subscribed
for the submerged tenth have forgotten all about
Booth; the tenth is as much submerged as ever, and
it seems to have utterly lost hope of ever being
anything else. The London papers have begun to
talk about the Salvation demonstrations as a
common street obstruction, and to urge that the
General should be “moved on.” The “farm
colony” is denounced as a sweating institution
and nobody seems to believe that the “oversea
colony ” will ever be started, or that the £lOO,OOO
subscribed will ever be heard of again. Booth
to-day is like the remains of a last night’s gorge,
when the lights are out, and the band is gone, and
the bottles are all empty, and everybody has big
head and a crashed shirt-front, and a crumpled
swallow-tail all over cigar-ash.

is going to commit a brutal homicide lie puts his
cigar on the mantelpiece, and comes back for it
afterwards.

Respite from your troubles finding,
Kiss her, till her pale cheeks burn,
For to-morrow will the grinding
Mill-stones of the city turn.
Stunted figures, sallow faces,
Sad girls striving to be gay
In their cheap sateens and laces.
Ah ! how different ’tis to-day
Where they’re going to the races—
Yonder—up Monaro way!
Light mist flecks the Murrumbidgeo’s
Bosom with a silver stain,
On the trembling wire bridge is
Perched a single long-legged cran?,
While the yellow, slaty ridges
Sweep up proudly from the plain.
Somebody is after horses—
Donald, Charlie or young Mac—
Suddenly his arm he tosses,
Presently you’ll hear the crack,
As the symbol of the cross is
Made on ’possum’s steaming bad:.
Stirling first, the Masher follows,
Ly-ee-moon and old Trump Card,
Ilelter-skeiter through the shallows
Of the willow-shaded ford,
L’p the lane and past the “ gallows,”
Driven panting to the yard.
In the homestead, what a clatter ;
Habits black and habits blue,
Full a dozen red lips patter:
“ Who is going to ride with who ? ’*
Mixing sandwiches and chatter,
Gloves to button, hair to “ do.”
Horses stamp and stirrups jingle,
Dash the filly ! won’t she wait ?”
Voices, bass and treble, mingle,
“ Look sharp, May, or we’ll be late;”
How the pulses leap and tingle
As you lift her featherweight !
At the thought the heart beats quicker
Than an old Bohemian’s should,
Beating like my battered ticker
(Pawned this time, I fear, for good).
Bah ! I’ll go and have a liquor
With the genial “ Jimmy Wood.”
BARCROFT H. BOAKE.
English widow ! ere we meet,
Tell, oh! tell me of thy feet;
Are they large and are they cold?
Deem these questions not too bold.
Say if thou art young, petite,
English widow ! ere we meet.
A CERTAIN TEST.
When a man is mad
And you keep him in a cell
He does not feel bad,
But particularly well;
He wears a smile bright,
He wouldn’t sigh in vain
(As another person might)
Bor his liberty again.
Tol-de-rol,
When a man is mad
He is always very glad,
You will never see him sad,
Oh ! no ;
A party gone insane
Cannot let his spirits wane
Like the melancholy Dane,
Heigho !
A fellow who is right,
If you lock him up for long,
Can be recognised at sight
By his liver going wrong ;
If he doesn’t seem resigned
To his fate a little bit,
He is healthy in his mind
(Even when he has a fit).
Tol-de-rol,
If a party rather likes
To be put behind the spikes,
Then a journalist he strikes
As odd ;
But should he wish instead
To be free and better fed,
Why, he can’t be off his head
(Great God !)
A Funny Game.
A few friends met the other night in a Newtown
store to spend a jovial evening, but as they were
all teetotallers and none of them drank anything
stronger than Clements Tonic, drunkenness was
out of the question. Mac. proposed a game
at euchre, and Jones said they had better play for
something just to give the game an interest and
make it lively, but times were hard, so they did
not care to play for money. Smith, however,
spied a box of Fletcher’s bilious and liver pills,
and proposed that each time a man was beaten he
should take a pill, and this made the game lively
and the fun was fast and furious. Simpson
swallowed five, Jones got away with four and
Smith and Hopkins two each and Mac. got off
scot free. The game terminated by a general
exodus at 3 a.m., for Dr. Fletcher’s pills never
labour in vain. They are the best and mildest
pills made and are sold by all chemists and
druggists everywhere; being a positive, safe,
and reliable cure for constipation, liver complaint,
headache, &c. They always give satisfaction.
The proprietors give away .£50 (in seven prizes) at
Xmas, for the seven first nearest guesses sent in,
as to how many of these pills a large Clements
Tonic bottle (now full) holds. A guess form is
around every box, and all such forms are eligible
for this competition that come from around a box.
One box of Fletcher’s Pills proves their virtues
and they can be obtained everywhere at Is., or

Registered at Sydney Labour Bureau :
82G1 unemployed. There are in N.S.W. about
320,000 white males between the ages of 18 and 05.
There are quite another 8000 unemployed roaming
about the province, or a total of, say, 10,000
visible unemployed—one out of every 20 of possible
workers. Yet Booth meditates dumping his
“Submerged Tenth” into N.S.W.
The discovery of the body of Mrs. Deem-
ing (Miss Mather) underneath the hearthstone at
Windsor, (Vic.) was, it now appears, not directly
due to the odour that assailed the nostrils of an
intending tenant, but to the fact that the land-
lord of the villa of the secret sepulchre noticed
that the hearthstone had been disturbed and left
raised a little above the level of the surrounding
flooring. Had Deeming not struck “hard pan”
at so shallow a level, the murder might
have cried out to heaven in vain up to this
day, and Kate Rounsefell might have been a
birdie bride in bonny West Australia, oh. The
course of true murder seldom runs smoothly.
Max Hirschfcldt and Williams are not on
gunning terms now. Max had the first promise
of that mysterious “ confession,” and subsequent
t > the inquest he wanted to load up the little man
with fruit and French lollies. But there were
other people sniffing round after that confession,
apparently. Anyway, Williams took a sudden
turn against Max, and wrote him a letter : “ You
have been such a good friend to me that I never
wish to see you any more ” Then Kate Rounsevell
was rushed into the position of first favourite for
fie coveted Book of Revelations, and poor Max
dropped clean out of the betting. No traces of his
old regard for the person behind the spikes were
perceptible in the German gentleman’s evidence,
last week. He even threw in a gratuitous sug-
gestion that the celebrated epileptic fit in the train
wasn’t genuine.
A Sydney constable captured a suspected
thief the other day and snapped “the bracelets”
on him. But the man got away, bracelets and all.
L iter, he was again arrested, and charged with a
particular larceny. None of the described stolen
property being traced to his possession, he was
discharged. Whereupon, the police at once
charged him with having stolen a pair of hand-
cuffs. The astounded prisoner made no defence
and was promptly sent to gaol by Magistrate Giles.
Under what sort of law happens this in N.S.
Wales? The officer gave the man the handcuffs,
positively forced them on him against his own
desires. One can't steal a gift. There is also no
law which constitutes the bolting of an uncom-
mited prisoner from a policeman a crime, provided
there is no personal violence, or “breaking out”
of gaol. In the former case, the offence lies in the
violence and not in the mere bolting for liberty,
which is simply the obeying of the natural impulse
of all restrained animals, human and other. In
the old convict times, when branding was in
vogue, could a policeman have charged a runaway
with stealing a Government brand ? Minister of
Justice Slattery should revise this handcuff
decision, and penalise Giles for the larceny of
common-sense.
Dear Bulletin, —It is pleasant to think
that, vide your last issue, “apiece of Victorian
legislation prohibits cabs being engaged by‘elec-
tion candidates.” I have a vote for a Melbourne
electorate, and on the night before last poll an
amiable gentleman called at my humble cot and
begged me to name the exact minute when “the
cab” should call for me next morning. An
appointment was made for 8.30 a.m., and on the
very stroke of the half-hour cabby was there.
Moreover he waited for me whilst I voted and
brought me home again. The vehicle (a hansom)
was so completely at my disposal that I might
have stopped to call upon all my friends by
the way had Iso desired. From that time I
have learned to think very highly of hansom cab-
men in general, because I saw them calling for
voters all, over the district, and sacrificing their
business interests to a public spirited desire
for a heavy polling. For, be it known, a
voter was not seemingly expected to take his
political principles from the candidate whose
name was postered on the cab. I found that the
overnight arrangement was a superfluous detail.
By standing at the garden-gate and blowing a
whistle, I might have entered into temporary
possession gratis of any blessed cab within range
of the shrill appeal. Hundreds of Jehuic political
enthusiasts were panting for the summons to give
an intelligent voter a free ride to any local polling-
place he liked to mention. In the face of “pre-
vailing depression ” this large-hearted behaviour
of the cabmen affected me deeply. They were
prejudiced in favour of particular candidates,
judging from the printed exhortations on their
vehicles, but the “views” of these good fellows
were not necessarily akin to those of the citizens
they slaved for. In fact, I have discovered that
“ plumpers ” for Brown or Jones usually make a
point of plumping themselves into a Smith
cab. —F.
W. Kinnaird Rose, ex-edifcor of Brisbane
Courier (Q.), and who is now cuddling himself
up in Edinburgh, Scot'and, writes in a letter
evidently intended for publication, and which
anyhow found publicity :
To black-labour per se 1 never had the slightest
objection in Queensland or elsewhere.
This Kinnaird Rose is the man who pandered
beyond all out-pandering to the insufferable per-
sonal vanity of Premier Griffith, and reaped
lucrative rewards for so grovelling. Sir Samuel
sponsored him at the Queensland Bar, Rose being
a “Scottish Advocate,” and, after Rose fairly
made Sam’s friends hysterical with a biography of
the great man, in whose personality he centred all
the finer attributes of a Wilberforce-cim-Washing-
ton cim-Bayard-cum-Bacon, no one was astonished
to see this then almost unknown new-chum pitch-
forked upon a Royal Commission which yielded
him many hundreds of guineas and much bogus
glory. And that Commission was the Polynesian
Labour Commission, fur the drafting of the report
of which Rose was personally responsible. That
report was described by Sir Samuel Griffith as
transcending in bloody horrors the blackest annals
of the slave-trade. Once more the fawning Kin-
naird Rose rises to back up his patron-demigod,
Griffith ; this time, it is to announce that he
“ never had the slightest objection ” to the Queens-
land slave-trade per sc. All he asks now is that
the Queensland Government shall appoint “Go-
vernment inspectors, well paid and of tjood
character ” —the italics are not ours—“ like the
‘protectors ’in the West Indies.” He says
Those being secured, I would cover Northern tropical
Queensland with labourers.
The hint is plain enough.
Fox’ “local paper” usually read “yokel
paper.”
Seventeen Melbourne banks, financial
institutions, and building societies succumbed in
tue panic.
TRAMWAY ACCIDENT,
RISKS OF SHOWING OFF.
THE other morning a gentleman employed in
one of the city banks experienced a narrow
escape from terrible injuries, if not instant death,
while attempting to enter a trarncur on the
Paddington line. This time, however, the
Government mangle was not in fault; and if the
individual in question had suddenly provided the
raison <V etre for a coronial inquiry, the blame for
such circumstance could not have been attached
to any other than himself. There are not a few
people who unwisely court disaster by their own
spontaneous acts of foolhardiness, and this person
is evidently one of them. He imagined he was
clever enough, by making a flying jump, to board
a through tram at the top of Barrack Hill,
although the result by no means justified his
belief. Seizing hold of the iron rail at the end
of the central car, he swung from the around,
intending to alight upon the footboard. To the
horror of all who witnessed the attempt, however
the foolish fellow instantly struck earth again’
right between the footboard of two fast-moving
carriages; and in this perilous position he was
forced to accomplish a “fastest on record ” sprint
for about 20 feet, when, an alarm being raised,
and the speed of the tram reduced, he was enabled
to throw ids body outward clear of danger. Twice
he was struck slightly on the back of the leg by a
footboard, and that he managed to escape with
his life is little short of a miracle. It is high
time that the reprehensible practice of entering or
alighting from tramcars while in motion was put
a stop to by the authorities, and a example made
of an offender against a rule which at present is,
unhappily, more honored in the breach than in
the observance. The junior assistant conductors
are the greatest sinners in this respect. Their
“showing off ” proclivities are quite inexcusable,
and by these a bad example is created. It is
impossible to warn the foolhardy. Sprained
ankles and wrists, chips knocked off hands and
knees by a too-sud_den impact with metalled road-
ways, and contusions upon various parts of the
anatomy alike fail to convince them of their folly.
You reason with them, and they answer, “ Oh,
that’s nothing; an application or two of St.
Jacob’s Oil will soon put that right.” Like
testimony to the virtues of this justly celebrated
pain-curing remedy and healing embrocation is
daily expressed all over the world, and letters
from grateful and delighted patrons pour in in
ever-increasing numbers, furnishing interesting
details of astonishing cures of rheumatism, sciatica,
neuralgia, and similar complaints effected by the
agency of the best preparation ever submitted to
the public.
ADVICE ABOUT WATCHES.
A prominent publication, devoted in the main
to household affairs, has recently given consider*
able space to advising its readers in regard to
taking care of their watches. We quote as follows :
“ There is no other personal belonging to which
good care is more essential than a watch, and
hardly any other that is more recklessly ill-used.
There is the highest authority for saying that the
best place for a watch is in its owner’s pocket.
The pocket should be a clean one, and the watch
be further protected by a chamois bag. It should
be wound with even, steady motion, not too fast
or too slow, and as nearly as possible r.t the same
hour of the day. Morning is the best time, and if
it is done while the watch has still an hour or two
to run there will be much less wear and tear of the
main-spring. In fact, paradoxical as it sounds, a
watch will wear out twice as soon by running one
day in 10, as it would if kept going all the time.
Let it lie flat as little as possible. Avoid jarring
your watch, under pain of having it stop and stop
until it grows worthless as a timepiece.”
To the above very sensible advice we cannot
resist the temptation of adding on our own account
the further advice to wear no watch but the
Waterbury. These watches are on all hands
admitted to be the cheapest timekeeping watches
in the world, whilst they have the additional
advantage of extreme ease and cheapness of repair.
They will stand a great deal of rough usage, but
there is no reason why the advice detailed above
should not be acted upon just as carefully with
the cheap and faithful Waterbury as with higher-
priced watches.

It is estimated that Adams’ “ Lattersalls
sweeps bring an annual revenue of about £9OOO to Sydney
G.P.O. It is also said that G.A. has in hand some
£50,000 unclaimed prize-money. He has been running
his show many years, and as the tickets are widely dis-
tributed and he only pays on production of winning
tickets, the amount he holds is probably very large indeed.

breakfasts, at various hotels, for 12 hungry bikemen.

Dear Bulletin, —Two or three days after your
“Nap” yarn appeared I was witness of a stroke of
artistic “ all-we-know ” practice that is worthy of a
record. The game was straight poker, the place was the
bar-parlour of a bush-pub, and the players, a party of
seven, road-makers off work by reason of rain. A and B,
sitting side by side, were, by private arrangement, playing
“ whacks” and affording glimpses of each other’s cards.
A held eight, nine, ten and Jack of Hearts and seven of
spades. B had a lot of “mullock,” including, however,
the Heart Queen. The transference of Her Majesty to
A’s hand would give him a “ straight flush ” of hearts. B
suddenly became anxious tolighthis pipe, and while fum-
bling with a lucifer dropped the Queen on the floor, and turn-
ing to A, said, “Pickup that spade seven for me, will
you, old man.” A took the hint, and, bending down,
placed the heart among his own cards, and threw the
small spade face up on the table. As luck would have it,
a player at the other end of the table held four kings, and
"chipped ” on them, and was promptly raised by A. The
pile on the table rose to some £4O odd, when the “ fours”
holder called, and A, by virtue of his “straight flush,”
annexed the pool. By this simple but elegant manoeuvre,
A and B pocketed about a month’s wages each, and all
went merry' as a marriage bell. —A Tent Dweller. Tas-
mania, April 26, 1892.

AT THE TUG - OF - WAR.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
’Twas in a tug-of-war where I—the guvnor’s hope and
pride—
Stepped proudly on the platform as the ringer on my
side;
Old dad was in his glory there—it gave the old man joy
To light a passage thro’ the crowd and barrack for his
boy.
Chorus.
For anthers, wives, and children, some mighty deeds are
done,
For sweethearts and for honour, great battles have been
won ;
But look for swelling muscles when the old man cheers
his son !
A friend came up and said to one, “Put out your muscles,
.1 ohn,
And pull them to eternity—your guvnor’s looking on.”
I paused before I grasped the rope, and glanced around
the place,
And, foremost in the waiting crowd, T saw tire old man’s
face.
My mates were strong and plucky chaps, but very soon, I
knew,
That our opponents had the weight and strength to pull
them through ;
The boys were losing surely and defeat was very near,
When, high above the mighty roar, I heard the old man
cheer!
I felt my muscles swelling when the old man cheer’d for
me,
1 fellas tho’ I’d burst my heart, or gain the victory !
1 shouted, “ Now ! Together!” A steady strain replied,
And, with a mighty heave, 1 helped to beat the other
side!
Oh ! how the old man shouted in liis wild, excited joy !
I thought he’d burst his boiler then, a-cheering for his
boy ;
The chaps, oil! how they cheered me, while the girls all
smiled so kind,
They praised me, little dreaming, how the old man pulled
behind.
He barracks for his boy no more—his grave is old and
green,
And sons have grown up round me since he vanished
from tire scene;
But, when the cause is worthy where I light for victory,
In fancy still I often hear the old man cheer for me.
Chorus;
For mothers, wives, and children, some mighty deeds are
done,
For sweethearts or for glory, we’d “ fetch’em” with a
run ;
But look for swelling muscles when the old man cheers
his son !

The Wild-Cat Column.
The Lode Hill tin-mine, New England, is in the
hands of the official liquidator. The liabilities amount to
something under £5OO. It has been discovered that in
the contract registered when the company was formed
the consideration was inadvertently omitted by the
solicitor who drafted it, which made it appear that the
40.000 paid-up shares were obtained for nothing; hence
the liquidator proposes to call up 7s. fid. a share on those
40.000 to equalise them with the 10,000 contributing
shares on which that amount has been paid. The N.S.W.
Master in Equity has upheld the decision, and now the
fun commences. Having called up ,£12,000 to pay £5OO,
presumably the balance will be distributed among the
shareholders, less, of course, expenses, which are already
pretty considerable. It is another lawyers’ feast.
Appeals—Equity, Full Court, Privy Council, are all
threatened. Altogether it is a nice mess, in which possi-
bly a number of innocent persons may suffer simply
because a badly-drawn contract, which they never saw,
omitted to state the consideration.
# * *
Miners are constantly urged by metal-brokers
to pay more attention to the production of the less
known metals such as wolfram, schelite, antimony, &c.
If they do the writer can assure them that unless they
send their products to English buyers they will be fleeced
to satisfy the greed of the middleman. To ship any of
these metals on advances means that fully one-half of the
value is eaten up in assaying here to guarantee the
advance, re-assaying in London to satisfy purchasers, in-
surance, bills of lading, wear and tear, storage, wharfage,
brokerage, commissions, interest,, exchange—often there
is no exchange- and other items which will swell up the
charges until there is little left. We have seen account-
sales of antimony shipped on advance which read like a
lawyer’s bill. A full expose of this monstrous system of
extortion is wanted.
* * *
In future all reports from the Mount Stewart
mine will be read in the light of those heretofore pub-
lished. The latest is “lode 20ft. wide in some places,
assays 29 and 62 ozs., struck new shoot, getting good ore,
assaying 130, 26, 35 ozs.’’ It is sheer nonsense or some-
tiling worse to publish assays in amine continually smelt-
ing. The smelting returns are the only reliable guage of
value, and we regret to say that those from Mount
Stewart are not very encouraging. It would be just as
absurd for the Victory mine to publish assays of stone
taken from certain parts of the Brilliant lode. The good
ore in the Mount Stewart mine, like most others, runs in
shoots, and it is pleasant to be able to record, on unques-
tionable authority, that the last struck indicates an
improvement in value.
* # *
A recent number of N.S.W. Government
Gazette records the cancellation of upwards of 80 mineral
leases in the district of Clarke, New England, taken up in
the name of a certain M.P. Is this the last of the great
Oban Gold and Tin Mining Company of which we heard
so much about two years ago? If so, for this much
thanks. The gold, tin, and gems were all very remark-
able for their ruinous scarcity.

If you want to see your bank manager’s face
express in turn sympathy and scorn, ask him to allow' you

The Star of the East, Ballarat, has declared its
forty-first dividend of 4s. It is a £24,000 company, with an
enormous quartz-lode opened up to a great depth, and
tens of thousands of tons in sight, which average about
15dwts. Nearly one-half of the gold is extracted from the
pyrites. # # #
Yilgarn, one of theW.A. goldfields, is distin-
guished by the average of an ounce to the ton from all its
principal mines, viz., Fraser’s, Fraser’s Central, South
and Extended. A field which maintains the average of
Yilgarn is likely to be permanent.
* # #
Old John Moore, for many years known as the
King of Armidale (N.S.W.), lies mouldering, etc. Bad
mines and seasons killed John financially about three
years ago. lie was part owner of the freehold of the Sun
ii<>ht mine at Hillgrove. When the present company
secured a long lease at 10 per cent royalty on the gross
many people laughed at John, who was adjudged thereby
a fool. So far, however, that 10 per cent has represented
the profits made. It is a fairly good shoot of gold in a
lode generally large but subject to variation, a good
dividend-paying property without the royalty, but with
it worked more for the benefit of the owners than of the
shareholders.
# # #
We admit that the Bear Hill Proprietary is an
enigma to all who have not been there. After more than
two years’ W'ork the public are still periodically informed
by newspapers that the lode continues to look well, and
that the battery is working all right. It appears to be
one everlasting crushing. Nothing is ever heard of
yields. At one time much was made of pestle and mortar
tests. By reports it would be easy to imagine a heap of
10,000 tons at grass. The w'riter has been there. It is a
bi”' mine—in respect to capital, which is over eight times
that of the Star of the East. By meansof several corners,
the shares have been up to £6, when they were not
worth sixpence. Newspapers have frequently located
the mine at Hillgrove, whereas it is an isolated barren
bush nearly one hundred miles away. It is within a mile
of Butchers Keef—another “ Wild Cat” of £200,000. By
its comparative worthlessness it has been the means of
squelching all mining industry in the district. For-
tunately it has dishonoured more than one Melbourne
man connected with it. Mr. Vickery, knowing its true
value, endeavoured to break the back of the “corner,”
and broke his own to the tune of nearly £20,000, although
the writer has and accepts his proud assurance that he
subsequently got level with the cornering crowd.
# # *
The Golden Terrace Hydraulic Sluicing Co., on
the Shoalhaven River, deserves to succeed. In blissful
ignorance of the real value of the ground, but guided by
certain experts, one of whom assessed its value at a
trifle of £3,800,000, they have expended £20,000 alto-
gether. The original ground was abandoned and the
race extended to another. At last the company have
done what should have been the first act—secured the
services of a practical, competent Sluicing man who is
bent on getting as soon as possible the main body of wash,
which is said to be worth in gold about Is. a cubic yard.
# # *
When the public of N.S.W. learns the differ-
ence between a narrow shoot of gold and a long run of
gold in a reef they will have received their most valuable
mining lesson. This, however, can only be acquired after
bitter experience. The depth to which gold is earned can
only be ascertained by going down to see, but the length
of the shoot is always measurable without difficulty.
# # *
“ You see I have a hermetically sealed retort.
By means of a great heat I will easily separate the gold
from the antimony,” said a man in explanation of his
patent. “ But do you know that under great heat and in
the absence of air antimony becomes a terrific explosive ?
“You don’t say so; 1 never thought of that! was the
candid reply of the astonished patentee, and thus the life
of an inventor was saved and another kronk patent nipped
in the bud.

Hopeless cases: When a man becomes fas-

simply because of the amount already sunk; when he
attributes everything to mismanagement, or damns the
machine used in treatment; when he has a fixed idea that
lodes increase in richness and size in depth; or when he
believes even 5 per cent, of what is said about it.

The other day, at Hobart, a C. of E. parson
was found in the Domain-dead, of poison. At the
inquest, it was elicited that the poor man (who
preferred death to starvation) had but recently
returned to Hobart, after an absence of nearly
thirty years, probably hoping, in his need, for a
fresh” start from old pupils, whom he had ably
taught in school in earlier days. He found out
several of his old scholars—most of them occupying
highly lucrative positions—but never a lift gave
they to their old mentor, and so, driven from his
lodgings, he despaired and died.
Jimmy Wood.
A Bar - Room Ballad.
There came a lonely Briton to the town,
A solitary Briton with a mission,
He’d vowed a vow to put all “ shouting ” down,
To relegate it to a low position.
Transcendentally Britannic in his dress,
His manners were polite and slightly formal,
And —this I mention with extreme distress —
His put-away for liquid was abnormal.
He viewed this “ shouting ” mania with disgust,
As being generosity perverted,
When any of the “ boys ” went on the bust
He strove his best that they might be converted.
He wouldn’t take a liquor with a man,
Not if he was to be hanged, and drawn, and
quartered,
And yet, he drank—construe it as you can—
Unsweetened gin, most moderately watered.
And when the atmosphere was in a whirl,
And language metaphorical ran riot,
He’d calmly tender sixpence to the girl,
And drink his poison— solus— nice and quiet.
Whenever he was asked to breast the bar
He’d answer, with a touch of condescension :
“ I much regret to disoblige so far
As to refuse your delicate attention.
“ That drink’s a curse that hangeth like a leech—
A sad but most indubitable fact is,
Mankind was made to drink alone, I preach,
And what I preach invariably practise.
“ I never pay for others, nor do I
Take drink from them, and never, never would
sir—
One man one liquor! though I have to die
A martyr to my.faith, that’s Jimmy Wood, sir.
“ My friend, ’tis not a bit of .use to raise
A hurricane of bluster and of banter,
I preacli the humble gospel in the phrase—
Simifia similibus curantur;
“Which means: by drinking how and when I
like,
And sticking to the one unsweetened sample,
I hope in course of time that it will strike
All men to follow up my good example.”
In course of time it struck all men that Jim
Was fast developing into a soaker—
The breath of palsy on his every limb,
A bleary face touched up with crimson ochre.
Yet firmly stood he by the sinking ship,
Went down at last with all his colours flying ;
No hand but his raised tumbler to his lip,
What time J. Woods, the Martyr, lay a-dying.
Misunderstood reformer ! gallant heart!
He gave his £ath to Death—the great collector.
Now ... in Elysian fields he sits apart
And sips his modest “Tommy Dodd” of nectar.
His signature is on the scroll of fame,
You cannot well forget, though you would, sir,
The man is dead, not so his homely name,
Who drinks alone—drinks toast to Jimmy
Wood, sir. #

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
On fust rehearsg.l of a play,
Tlie author finds Jus strength astray;
The how and what that he designed
Are faulty to the actor mind ;
His studies are less worthy far
Than the impressions of the star
Who rules unchecked, especially
When actor-manager is he,
A player of a high degree.
Poets, he learns, are prone to err
In estimate of character,
And have their fads about the way
The actor should unfold the play.
But all the stars, from Garrick down,
Whose fair renown has filled the town,
Have dubbed the poet incorrect
In business, dress, and dialect,
And met his views with disrespect.
Physique and face and voice and grace
Are requisite in any case—
A diamond in the rough should be
A sparkling gem theatrically—
And starving man or artisan
Must, as a rule, be spick and span,
To please the eye, and dignify
The actor, as he represents
The hero of the brief events
No matter how the bard dissents.
The hero who has failed in life,
Disgraced and ruined in the.strife,
Must still appear in lordly style
And rant subjection with a smile :
Though both by fate and hate accurst,
Must shout soliloquies, and thirst
To picturesquely face the worst.
Tradition loves to dwell upon
The times that, art be praised, are gone:
Of Shylock in a flaming w ? ig
And Richard’s Restoration'rig.
Less worthy customs still survive
Our plays of nature to deprive,
To cloud the scenes and acts that press
Upon the hero in distress,
Before his ultimate success.
The splendid few r but ill atone
For faults to which the herd are prone,
And seldom time and chance affords
To see the giants of the boards
In vain for intellect and heart
Is nature fogged in faulty art;
And yet it somehow means success:
Appointments, scenery, and dress,
Being good—the public acquiesce.
QUANDONG.
The British Australasian, a small paper
published in London for the gratification of the
“ returned colonist,” says : “It is hopeful to see
that a vigorous man like Mr. J. B. Patterson
pushes aside all quack remedies and goes to the
root of the disorder when he says that the colony
must produce more—must increase her exports.”
In other words, Victoria must have more wealth,
for exports are surplus wealth, and the province
must have the wealth before it can export it. This
is going to the root of the matter in real earnest.
When Patterson meets a man who has been
brought so low by sickness or accident that he has
to go barefoot, he straightway “pushes aside all
quack remedies,” and says, “My friend, you
must have more boots,” and then having solved
the problem he goes away. We wonder if it has
ever dawned on Patterson that the best cure for
drought is more rain. If it hasn’t, we would like
to draw his attention to the point.
The electoral map of New South Wales,
issued by Messrs. Higinbotham and Robinson, of
Sydney, is a publication which every politician
and journalist should get and keep. It shows the
various electorates of the province, those coloured
red being Protectionist, and those uncoloured
being of the Foreign-trade persuasion. The map is
almost all red, more than three-fourths of thearea of
the province being represented by Protectionist
members. Practically the two parties represent the
city against the country, the Foreign-trade element
being almost entirely in Sydney and its im-
mediate vicinity, while the interior gives a
solid support to the policy of the Dibbs Cabinet.
The publication also shows the voting-power of
the various constituencies, and how it was exercised
at the last general election. Protection represents
110,650 electors, who east 204,246 votes ; Foreign-
trade, 89,358 electors, casting 221,657 votes. In
other words, Protection has a majority of 21,292
men, while the other cause has a majority of
17,411 votes—showing the solid advantages of
bricks and mortar over mere humanity. Outside
the little patch of ground called the metropolitan
district, Protection scored 192,000 votes against
82,000 for Foreign-trade. The Bulletin cordially
recommends the S.M. Herald and Daily Tele-
graph to buy this publication and keep an eve on
it when next they drop into statistic?.
\xctoria contains two clerical magnates
whose lives are embittered by the knowledge
that each resembles the other so closely that their
respective flocks can’t tell the difference until they
have commenced to unburden their souls to the
wrong shepherd, and been severely apprised of
the error. Dr. Corbett, the R.C. Bishop of Sale,
and Canon Langley, the Anglican Archdeacon of
Gippsland, are the twin victims of this painful
circumstance. For a time they were aggrieved
sources of endless confusion in the same Alel-
bourne suburb (St, Kilda), and anon,.when Dr.
Corbett blossomed into a bishop and was put up
to Sale, his Protestant shadow got a lift in a like
direction, and the old trouble broke out again
worse than ever. At present they are both living
in the Gippsland town, and getting more identical
every day. The Bishop grows a beard exactly
like the Archdeacon, whilst Langley sticks to
green spectacles of Corbett’s own favourite brand.
Every night they pray at their respective bedsides
for the other apostle to get shaved, or start an
eyeglass in place of goggles, but they scorn the
thought of holding a Christian conference, and
coming to terms on the matter. Meanwhile they
are both of them afraid to give the barber a job,
for fear the other should have just changed his
aspect in the same way. Under existing con-
ditions they hesitate to walk down the street.
The Archdeacon is worried by devout Catholics
calling upon the Saints to i: presarve ” him, whilst
the Bishop’s blood congeals when a bigoted low
churchman grabs him by the buttonhole and begs
him to rub it into the Pope a bit, next Sunday.
Probably Dr. Corbett is the worse sufferer of the
two. If the Archdeacon bikes a drive with a
nice young niece the Bishop is sure to hear of it.
Next day a mistaken Irishman, with a wink in his
other eye, comes up to the exalted celibate and
says, “ Ah ! yer Riverence, shure an’ I saw yer
riverence taking the air wid a pur.ty gal,” where-
upon his reverence hurls virtuous thunder at the
trembling Pat and sends him home to save his
immortal soul before it is too late.

THE BEALE PATENT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and tlie general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the adjustments are
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and no time
is wasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
The Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work; you may make a pretty lace
stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or niching; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same time ; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassars, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ;do large cording; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
eotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make button and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances wall be shown at our
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating. —In our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can be inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may be had upon easy time-
navment, or for cash less three shillings in the
pound.

The Missing Super.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“It’s a bad plan, and generally breeds trouble,”
said Hervey.
“ Well, at any rate I gave him a pretty severe
hiding, and I bet he’ll be all the better for it,”
replied Ross.
Hervey shook his head. “You can knock a
nigger about the head as much as you like and
lie thinks nothing of it, but use a whip to him and
he never forgets it. Powlang will have it in for
you if ever he gets the chance.”
Ross was a new hand in outside country where
he had lately taken charge of a station. Like
most new-comers, he had a theory of his own how
to treat blacks, and like most new-comers he went
to an extreme. His view of the case was that of
ruling with a hand of iron, and as the blacks had
but lately been allowed to come in to the frontage
unmolested, they were naturally constantly in-
fringing the petty rules he had tried to break them
into; generally, through ignorance. Powlang
was a fine young native, nearly six feet high, with
a rather intelligent face. For some reason Ross
had an especial “down-” upon him. Catching him
one day out hunting near a cattle-camp the blacks
had been told to avoid, he bestowed a flogging on
Him with his stock-whip. This was the little
affair he had been telling his neighbour, Hervey,
about.
Apparently Powlang forgot all about his whip-
ping in spite of what Hervey had said, for he
came into the station and was made useful in many
ways, Ross having also seemingly buried the
hatchet.
Gradually Powlang learned to ride and became
one of the regular station staff, and matters went
on very smoothly for nearly a year, Ross exer-
cising his whip occasionally on some of the re-
fractory natives, and asking Hervey whenever
they met, “ when his fate was to come off ?”
Fifteen miles from the head station was an out-
station wi’th a small stockyard attached. Here
a good deal of the mustering and branding was
done to avoid the long drive into the head station.
The place simply consisted of a slab hut and a
yard, but a small patch of scrub intervened
between the two, and the yard was not visible
from the hut. There had been a spell of dry
weather, then rain fell, and in a week or two mus-
tering commenced. All hands nearly were camped
at the out-station for five or six days, and many
of the niggers had found their way out and earned
a little tobacco helping at the branding-yard.
Work was all finished at dusk one evening and
the next morning they all started for the head
station. Ross did not leave at the same time as
the others, as, with Powlang, he was going home
a different route, and when the men left the other
blacks were still in camp.
Ross did not return that day, and the next
morning all the blacks about the place had left.
This was ominous. Hervey came over and a
search-party started. The tracks of the two
horses were picked up at the out-station hut and
followed from there to the river. Here they
turned up the river, and in a few miles were inter-
mixed with numerous tracks of natives. This
continued, the tracks of the blacks keeping
steadily up the river, the footprints of the two
horses being occasionally detected amongst them.
At last a point was reached where the river
emerged from the coast-range through a broken
gorge, and the party soon came to a clean-swept
bed of sand with a water-hole at the upper-end.
This, as most of them knew, was as far as the
horses could go up the course of the stream ; but
there was plenty to attract their attention. The
blacks had camped there, and the remains of the
two horses were scattered on the sand amongst the
ovens of blackened stones where their flesh had
been cooked.
“Twenty-four hours too late,” said Hervey.
“But what have they done with Ross?”
On searching about it was soon found that the
blacks had split up. One party had made for the
mountains on the north side, and one for the
southern range. The whites divided in pursuit,
and two days afterwards turned up at the head
station tired and hungry, with footsore horses,
both parties unsuccessful.
The fate of Ross could only be conjectured.
Nothing belonging to him had been found in the
blacks’ camp, and most people believed in the
ghastly story that was circulated, that he had
been cooked and eaten as well as the horses.
Two months after this episode two of the men on
the station had occasion to camp at the out-station
hut. They reached the place at dusk, turned out
their horses, lit a fire, and, while their quarts
were boiling, amused themselves by taking down
the greenhide ropes, kept there for branding, and
unwinding them to see if the weevils had got into
them.
“What’s come of the long catching-rope, Bill?”
said one at last.
“Dashed if I know,” was the reply, and they
searched the hut without success.
“Must have been left up the yard,” said Bill.
“The dingoes have got it by this time, I’ll be
bound. I’ll have a look in the morning.”
“ Wonder what became of Ross, after all?” said
one, as they sat before the fire discussing the
evening meal.
“Hang it! I was just thinking of him, too.
Suppose it is because he was the last man here;
hope he doesn’t haunt the place.”
After a few more words they lit their pipes, and
soon retired to their blankets.
“Blessed if I can sleep, and you don’t seem
much better,” said Bill about 12 o’clock, getting
up from his bunk, and poking the smouldering
sticks in the fireplace together.
“No, I never was so restless in my life,” re-
turned his companion.
Both men started their pipes, and, between
smoking and dozing, wore away the hours till
daylight broke.
Picking up his bridle, one went after the horses,
the other filled the quarts and stood them by the
fire.
The sun had just risen when he heard, his mate
coming back ; the horses jogged past the hut on
their way to the yard, rattling their hpbble-cha-ins,
strapped on one leg. Bill heard his companion
walk after them, whistling as he went, then he
threw the tea into the quarts and took them off
the fire. Just as he did so, his mate rushed wild.y
in.
“God Almighty, Bill! Come up to the yard !
Ross is up there !”
The men stared at each other aghast. One with
the horror he had seen ; the other at the horror in
his friend’s face. Then they both hastened to the
yard.
The horses were standing with their ears cocked,
staring with distended eyes at an awful object in
the branding-yard
A shrunken, eyeless, rotting corpse stood, ap-
parently erect, in the centre of the yard, witli
lolling liead and drooping arms.
The two men clutched each others hands.
“There’s the rope,” said Bill, breaking the
awed silence.
The commonplace words restored their courage,
and they approached the remains of the murdered
man. It was Ross, the missing super.
A loop in the middle of the catching rope had
been twisted round his neck, the ends passed
through the rails on the opposite sides of the little
yard, and then hauled taut, and made fast.
Suspended thus by the neck, the body had. the
appearance of standing upright in the middle of
the yard. Subsequent investigation went to show
that, in all probability, he was senseless at the
time, as the skull bore the mark of a blow ; and
one of the gins confessed that he was first knocked
on the head by Powlang.
The yard was at the back of the hut, with the
patch of scrub between, and the search-party,
picking up the tracks at once, had never thought
of looking at the yard. For two months the dead
man had swung there, a gruesome caretaker of the
lonely out-station.
Powlang and the other blacks who were known
to have camped at the hut at the time of that
fatal muster, were, on different occasions, “dis-
persed in the Queen’s name” during the ensuing
twelvemonths.

By its powerful action on the Tubercle Bacillus. It never
fails to arrest the disease, even in its most advanced stages
TESTIMONIALS:
“ Two years ago I suffered seriously from consumption.
I coughed incessantly, was prevented from sleeping
through night sweats, and my health seemed entirely
broken. After having tried treatment of different kinds,
both on and without recommendation of doctors, 1 was
advised to try Herr von Ditten’s Consumption Cure. At
first it did not seem to have much effect, but after a couple
of months use according to directions, my health com-
menced to improve, and after a few months more a com-
plete cure was effected. I have never had a relapse, and
am still enjoying excellent health. I cannot do better
than to express my boundless gratitude, and to advise
other sufferers from consumption to try this marvellous
remedy without delay.—(Signed) Mrs. H. Krumlisidb,
8 Bahdwick View Terrace, Newlaud-street, Waverley.
Sydney, March 16, 1892.”
'The undersigned, H. Hyett, certifies that “Two years
ago I was suffering from consumption in an advanced
stage, with coughing and spitting of blood and general
decline. My doctor declared me to be suffering from
consumption, and both I and my friends had almost
given up hope. I was then induced to try Herr von
Ditten’s Consumption Cure, and the effect soon became
apparent. After using the remedy for several months
according to. directions, I am happy to say that I was
completely cured, and the cure has been a lasting one.
Words fail to express my gratitude for what I call the
saving of my life. I only hope that other sufferers will
give this great remedy a trial,.and I feel confident that
they will not be disappointed if they persevere.—(Signed)

SICKNESS CURED HEALTH PRESERVED and LIFE PROLONGED by Dr. A. WILFORD HALL’S CS-RBikT X>lSo<o'^r£?
The treatment disclosed is unfolded in the “ Health Pamphlet ”-a condensed prescription of 48 pages. To read and study this pamphlet is to gam a fund of physiological, pathological *
therapeutical knowledge that a hundred times the cost of the pamphlet would not purchase from its owner could it be given back and blotted from his memoi j.
Dr. A. Wii.forp II vix, Ph.D., I-L.D., F.S.S.C., &c.
Let it bo distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst oases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption-
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in,
eluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus alloyin'/
nature herself to do her work unimpeded.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to. re-
require a “ Pledge of Honor ” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be maintained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Read the Reports from Sydney Papers.
The Australian Temperance World says;—“ We can
thoroughly recommend it as a genuine treatment that
must benefit most all disorders. It requires no outlay
after purchasing the pampnlet. It is based upon
thoroughly hygienic principles, and we believe every
thorough user must receive benefit. One great considera-
tion with ladies will be that it secures a clear skin and
speedily does away with a muddy complexion, and
removes all eruptions arising from diseased conditions of
the blood. We have made ourselves familiar with the
pamphlet, and heartily endorse it.”
Presbyterian, of July 4, says:—“We have seen the
pamphlet, and can thoroughly recommend its rationale.”
The Australian Star says:—" It is thoroughly purify-
ing. hygienic, and rational in the highest degree.”
The Echo, Bulletin, and other leading papers speak in
similar unqualified terms.

CORRESPONDENCE
No notice will be taken of communications which arrive
at this office insufficiently stamped.
“ J. M‘K.” (Silverton): Thanks “T. Mac.”:
Thanks. Will consider ~. “ J.H.G.” ; Good in spots, but
sounds like inferior Shelley' mixed with “ The Last
Man ” and “ the way the water comes down at Lodqre,”
together with Byron’s “Ocean,” “ The Marriage of Thzah
and Ahirad,” &c., &c...,“ P.” : Thebushman who offers to
punch a whole drawing-room full of people simply because
he gets mad at their collars and tail coats is a hog—not a
subject for poetry. ..“Linnet” (Bathurst): Declined.
Every lord in the comic bush yarn turns out bogus; if
you made him real it would be a lot more original...
“Dunbar”: Any pious paper would be glad of that
poem, but to send it here is placing pearls before
swine. We are the swine... “Dingo”: Metre bumps
heavily, like verse that is dragged by wild poets over a
rough road “ R.S.” (Sydney): The simple, unpretend-
ing suicide of a girl in tights has no points to recommend
it. Suicide isn’t so essentially different from any other
act of everyday life that you should make a fuss about it
anyhow, and y'ou shouldn’t head it “Her Own Act.”
How' could her own suicide be anybody else’s act?....
“ G. Bettey ” : Yes, when anarchist Munoz turns one to
be but a police fizgig....“ J.0.R.” (B. Hill): Letter
posted “A Navvy”: Thanks. Impossible to secure
oneself against such occurrences “L. 8.5.” (Cal., Q.):
Sorry to say' quite out of our line. Afraid you are worsting
your 1ab0ur....“ 5.J.0.”: The simplest definition of
bi-metalism is that it is an arrangement which permits a
man to have the option of paying his debts in silver or in
gold. The effect of a double standard would be to main-
tain the equilibrium of these metals, as when gold for a
time became scarce men would pay in silver. This.would
reduce the demand for gold, remove the strain on
it, and diminish its value. In the same way, a
scarcity of silver would throw the strain on gold.
With a bi-metallic standard there would, it is con-
tended, always be a sufficiency of one metal to meet the
W'ants of the business world, and a serious depression of
prices, such as Australia in common with the rest of the
world is suffering from just now, could hardly occur
“Honesty”: Thanks.... “Paroo ” : Write to Edwards,
Dunlop & Co., Sydney'. (2) One edition. ..“E.M.”:
The efforts made by the Queensland Parliament and
Brisbane press to impeach the character of Judge Lilley
are obviously intended to damage him in view of his pro-
bable descent from the bench into politics... .“ R.V.”
(Aranac); Funny to witness, yet hardly a theme for
effective illustration “C.M.J.”: Such an operation
would, in Melbourne or Sydney, cost you, say, £5O or £6O.
If you cannot afford to pay', it will be done at the hospital
for nothing by the very man who, if you came to him as
a private patient, would charge the sum mentioned above.
The surgeons are even less likely' to “slum ” an hospital
operation than one done in private practice, as a surgeon
has his inter-professional reputation to consider, and at
every major operation there are many expert medical men
present “W. Belcher”: Sorry can’t remember the date...
“ R. I. Irving”; Poem good in some respects, but 22
Verses is too much. As for the Robertson story, antiquity
wasn’t born when that joke’s hair turned grey “No-
body” (Hawthorn): Yes. He was “after The Bulle-
tin ” and didn’t catch up “ Thos. R.W.0.” (P.).! Seems
to us you are a religious crank. Why do you write to us
of all people about the “branch kingdom Of David?”
“ R. Lyons” : The man who answers queries about the
Eastern Question Is away having a bath—“ Rastler
(Melbourne): Without exception the most awfully in-
volved and hideously tied-up-in-a-hard-knot story we ever
met “ Como”: Will consider. Thanks.. , .“Rattus :
“ Bill’s Yarn” has one incurable defect: Bill awoke and
it was only a dream. Perdition is full of inconsiderate
Bills like that.... “ J.H.G.” :No bridegroom ever wrote
a full description of his new-made bride in a column of
verse and sent it to the papers. It is playing things very
low down on the bride, anyhow.... “ J.A.8.” (Hawthorn):
Thanks “ Sydney): Divorce, as a system, is chiefly in
favour of the man, who, unlike the woman, doesn’t come
out of marriage a damaged article. The dandy at 50 is as
good as new. What price the divorced woman of 41?....
“Gumleaf”: To hand. Thanks . “A.V.P.”: Write
again “ J.P.8.” : Thanks.... “ J.W.S.” : Your remark
as to the liability of borrowers would not apply to
all N.S.W. societies.. ~ “ J.G.” : Not this time
“ France ” (Prahran): Very irrelevant. To say that one
criminal should not be punished merely because there are
others as had is just as sensible as saying that because
some people are hungry therefore no other people should
have a good dinner....“B.R.”: One of these huge,
massive jokes which ought to be taken to pieces and sent
down bv bullock-dray, or gravel-train, nr protracted raft,
or something....“J.C.F.” (Waterloo): The stalest story
we know is that of the dapper little swell who, being
assailed by a “ push,” knocks out the whole hulking
crowd and then trots home singing a hymn.,..
“ G.H.G.” (North Melbourne); Declined “H. Bell ” :
We haven’t time to whitewash dead kings
“Peter Block” : 700 years old, about,...“ G. 8.” (Queens-
land); Please send exact address ~“W. Compton”:
Will read,..." Query” : Better to be called a coward, or
have the Anarchists chop off both your legs? Suppose
the Law isn’t able to protect a man, he must protect
himself.. “ Soc.” : You say you believe in “ one-raan-one-
rifle.” Then you must also believe in one-capitalist-one-
Nordenfeldt. Until the Australian democracy has
honestly tried and failed to secure one-man-one-vote it is
better to say nothing about an appeal to ironmongery....
“ Robt. K.” (Goulburn): You say “ Though the sentiment
of my verse is directly 'contrary to your principles, I
believe The Bulletin is too fair to refuse a hearing to the
other side of the question,” and then you enclose some
doggerel in praise of the deceased Clarence. All right. If
the papers on your own side will be equally “ fair,” we
are on. Get the Sydney Mail to publish a poem in favour
of Socialism, revolution, and the coming Republic, and
your doggerel goes right in.... “Stalker ” : In other
words, The Bulletin is an offensive publication, and
should be suppressed. Quite'so. Do you have these fits
often, and do you fall into the fire much when you have
them “ Windsor ” : Our own private opinion is that
the Windsor murder wasn’t done by F. B. Deeming, but
by someone else of the same name.

When you are suffering from indigestion no good
can result from taking tonics or stimulants, which
create a false appetite and conduce to an overload-
ing of the stomach at a time, when the digestive
organs are incapable of performing their proper
functions. If a stimulant is fancied the desire can
be effectually, but only temporarily, satisfied by
taking a teaspoonful of brandy diluted with water,
but if a permanent cure for indigestion is desired
take Boot’s Indigestion Cure, which is not a “cure
all”—claiming to be a specific for every epidemic
that arises—but is an absolute cure for Indigestion
only. _ _ ,

Tales of the Early Days.
No. VI.—The Conclave of Doom.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRICE WARUNG.
.Night iu the Iron Room. The majority
of the men we saw in the Ironed Yard on last
Sunday, when at the Session of Denunciation,*
•ire lodged here. Perhaps a hundred seek thfe
phantasm of repose on, the low platforms of its
floods; the rest, some forty or fifty, are privileged to
slumber in a smaller dormitory adjacent. And,
save by the utterly, reckless (ever, alas ! all too
numerous among the ironed men), the privilege of
sleeping in the smaller room was highly valued
for several reasons, only a few of which, however,
dare be stated. The transports thpre, accom-
modated were the first to be let out in the morn-
ing—that was one reason; consequently they
enjoyed the earliest use of the towels—this was a
second reason. And a third, and even more
important one, was that they were not liable to be
disturbed after midnight by a Ring conclave. It
was one thing to enjoy the solemnity pf the
society’s proceedings in the day-time a lodge
broke" the tedium of the monotony; but it was
quite another to lose the superior distraction' that
came-in the shape of sleep, simply because the
“One’’and the “Three” desired to piTr.sue'With"
adequate rite and ceremony their machinations
against the System. Sleep, so precious to all; was;
trebly precious to the “Black Norfolker.” , To
tlie felon denizens of the Iron Room sleep was
almost as welcome as his “ twin-brother,” death.
And so, when it became known in the Iron
Room the Wednesday evening after the Sunday of/
Denunciation that, in all likelihood a Ring con-
clave would be held that midnight, the members of
the outer Circles and the novices of the Ring, no
less than the miscellaneous criminalswho were not
associated with the Society, were somewhat
troubled. The day had been marked by one of
those hurricanes which, springing with suddenness
from the surface of the Pacific, die as suddenly
after spending their tropical rage disastrously
upon every object within their scope ; and most of
the men, having been exposed to its violence, were
suffering from bodily exhaustion. Maconochie
had excelled himself and desecrated the sacred
traditions of the Island by ordering warm tea to
be supplied to every man engaged in outdoor em-
ployment, and, in some cases, indeed, he had
granted hot rum, and had, further, shortened the
evening muster by withholding “ prayers,” so that
the prisoners might seek their blankets the earlier.
And* now the Commandant’s solicitude was to be
partially neutralised by the mandate of the “ One.”
Yet remonstrance, audible and overt, was never
once thought c. Had the cases been reversed and
it bad been the Authorities who had with apparent
wantonness interfered with the transports’ poor
comfort, a disturbance would have arisen that
would not have been readily quelled. Almost the
solitary remark uttered with reference to the Ring’s
action was that of a wretch, Sam Ward, who from
a certain eccentricity of habit—he was for ever
speaking to himself—had been refused the greatly
coveted honour of admission to the Circles.
When the signal went round that a Conclave was
to be held and that their rest would be disturbed,
he said “Ah, well—’tis a pity, Sammy ! You’re
always-free when you’re asleep, and you’re so tired
to-night, Sammy, freedom’d be all the sweeter ! ”
Beyfend these words, the mandate of the Ring met
nfe impediment. .
# * * •
• At six .o'clock, wbed'the last padlock,
clinched itfe hold'en tire doors, and thfe bolts shot
in the iron-shutters of the two windows, the
hundred men ceased communication with the
outer world till 12 hours later. So the System
judged and ordered.
' But at 12 o’clock the secret society intervened.-
A. careful grinding of a key in a padlock was
followed by an almost noiseless drawing of bolts
a'pd the dropping of chains. And then the door
the System had closed and virtually sealed, was
opened by the authority of the Ring. The “One
entered —followed by Peake, the accuser of Con-
vict -Henry Reynell per Coquette, the prisoner
lying under condemnation of the Ring.
The night’s conclave was to-pronounee ReynelTs
doom. You may remember* that Reynell had
been appointed by Captain Maconochie, leader of
the- ‘-'mutual responsibility ” sub-gang attached to
SB.farm, and that Peake had been one of the four
hardened,- reckless criminals whom Reynell had
selected to-accompany him.ff. - -“ Barrington,” an
ex-forger, Osborne, a gentleman who, to his
brdther-felotls’ surprise, -judges resolutely refused
to hang-<-alTrules have exceptions—and Bill Felix,
a stubborn,'country-bred half-brute, were the others
of. the gang. And-you may remember further
“that ! Peake had denounced Reynell to the Ring
_beoa«-sd.tbe latter, an ex-soldier, had been so im-,
.pressed by Captain Maconochie’s unforced kindli-
nes's'of heart asdo'defy the Ring and promise “ to
• be true man ” to-thte Commandant. According to
the Canons > of the- 1 Society, Reynell had thereby
grievously offended, alVd at.his resulting/trial had
bfeen condemned, Peake and Osborne alone of his
the farm voting to-remit him- to the
“Conclave of Doom.”. ■
On this Wednesday night, then, ReynelTs fate
was to be decided, and Peake, being a member of
the dread innermost circle of the “ Three,” had
resolyed to be present,. There was no difficulty in
the way of his attendance. The “ mutual respon-
sibility” gangs were free within limits. By
eight o’clock (instead of six as in the dormitories
and cells) they turned in. To be out of their hut
after that hour was an offence against the Regula-
tions and a violation of the conditions on which
they, held the farms. But Air. Peake .reflected
that no one would be likely to know of his breach
of good faith except those who would not “ peach. ”
The essence of Maconochie’s mutual responsi-
bility plan was that for an offence of one member
of a gang all the other members suffered, the idea
being that while a man would not, be deterred
from wrong action by fear of his own punishment,
he would be restrained by regard for his fel-
lows. Even over rascals, of. Peake’s stamp
this idea held sway, and that Tump of moral
and physical deformity, under ordinary circum-
stances, would have gone to the death rather than
have brought Reynell under the . whip of the
Authorities. A defiance of the Ring was, how-
ever, another matter, the wretch reasoned, and
notwithstanding his personal debt to the man he
denounced, who had obtained for him freedom
from irons and comparative immunity from super-
vision, bis stunted intellect perceived but.the one
duty of denouncing the fellow who had insulted
their noble society, and of pursuing him, if the
“One” permitted, to the doom. It was for this
life was present. ’
And if you ask how the “ One,” and Peake the
Three, obtained access to the Iron Room when the
keys-were under lock and key in the Superinten-
dent’s office, all we can tell you is that there were
but few prison-locks the “ One ” could not open.
' ’ # * *
The'great chamber as the chief rulers of
the Ring entered it, was curtained in darkness
that might be felt. In some of the other dormi-
tories a light was permitted after lock-up, but by
virtue of their superior distinction the gentry and
nobility of the Iron-room were left without a
glimmer.
Undeterred by the darkness, the One and his
companion passed from the doorway down the
middle of the room, as though they were familiar
with every inch of the planking. Nor was it till
some moments later that, a strong, vivid flash from
a bull’s-eye lantern shot, meteor-like, from the end
furthest from the door. The brilliant beam pro-
jected its penetrating-sti'oke through the massy
blackness, to the distant ebrbers and along the
walls that were decorated -only with “Abstracts
of Regulations ” and Forms of Prayer. For a full
m-imjte it played on the occupants of the room,
and then, apparently satisfying the person who
■held.it-that aU was right, the light was closed
agaih by the lantern slide. The mysterious busi- .
ness of the Four might be proceeded with, for
there were no*eSvesdroppers 6r unauthorised per-
sons near enough to hear. ■ , > ; ' - . '
The bulk of the transports were crowded
together in the corners nearest to the doors,' with
tfieir faces turned to the walls, and between them
and the upper end of the room the members of the
circles of “.Five,” “Seven,’’and “ Nine’’patrolled
noiselessly in stockinged feet, and “ blanketed ”-
irons.J These guards, sentries of a very hell,
crossed the room from bed-place to bed-place. Nob
a soul was asleep; and, save the guards, not a
body was in motion. * _
A short space of twelve paces separated the
nearest line of guards—the “Fives”—from the
group Of- four men who supplied the infernal
motive-power to the machinery of the Ring.
Thus, as the “One” and the “Three” communi-
cated only in their “cant” or “flash” dialect,
excepting in the rare cases when the subject
matter of their deliberation passed beyond its far
from, narrow vocabulary, the “Conclave” was
held . practically in private. Shut in the Four
were, by the-conditions which exalted them to
their “bad eminence.” The “ One ” was masked.
It would have been the easiest thing for the
transports generally to have discovered his identity.
They had but to rush in a body from the lower
end of the room, and, overpowering the guards,
seize the man who exercised over them an autho-
rity less questioned than that of the System. An
inclination to such an act, indeed, had more than
once been expressed by a more than ordinarily
defiant spirit among the outsiders, but it had
.never found general favour. The mass of convicts
felt that the Ring, though occasionally a hard
taskmaster, gave them ample compensation for the
tribute of obedience it. exacted. It furnished
material for their cramped imaginations and
ambitions to work upon —it supplied an outlet for
their,sense of natural justice so consistently out-
raged by the authorities —it checked and thwarted
the System—it had revenged many of the System’?
wrongful acts. Nothing to weaken or endanger
the rule of the Ring would ever spring from the
transports generally : of that the “ One” apt} the
“Three” felt quite sure. And so, they did not
hesitate to exact penances and institute forms
which the legally-constituted authorities dare not
have imitated save at the risk of rebellidm Had
the System -sent -a .masked 1 PJan into the muster-
yard of the ironed men jind declar'ed-that death
should be tholfet of the boW' villain who tore the
mask from the face, a score of hands would have ,
clutched at it. What odds the yard had been
turned into an aceldama, if the System had been
defied? Yet. the Ring sent its masked leader,
Whom nobody but the “ Three ” knew, and for the
secret of whose identity the System was prepared
to pay the price of an absolute pardon, kept
already signed and sealed in the. Commandant’s
desk : no paltry ticket-of-leave —not even the
desirable conditional pardon which conferred
liber.ty within Australian boundaries; but an
absolute gift Of freedom and a present of money
besides• to-carry the informer “home” and to
start him in a new life —the Ring sent this man into
the midst of vassals, and they, burning to know
who he was, and tacitly demurring oftentimes to
his rule, yet crushed their curiosity and obeyed
him. “The Ring is wonderful!” exclaimed Hr.
Ullathorne to Major Anderson, who had just
described the .Ring (from less information than we
have) to the young priest. “ Wonderful, sir !”
ejaculated the choleric, but conscientious Com-
mandant, “ It’s damnably annoying besides being
wonderful!” ,
# * *
The masked man knew the “Three” —
Johnson and Gooch, inmates of the Iron Room,
and Peake, of 5B farm gang. Nevertheless, from
each’he demanded the password'of his circle and
the sign of his membership of the supreme
rank but one. At the word being given in a low
murmur that stirred the darkness like a witch’s
spell, he began the brief Liturgy of the Conclave.
“For whose service do we meet?” asked the
“'One.” . ; : <
“ In the service of the Devil —the Devil our Lord /’
responded the “Three.”
“But the Devil our Lord is Invisible?”
“Aye, as invisible as death !”
■ “Yet is death visible?”
“Aye, to those 'who can sec
“Then, is our Lord visible?”
' v Aye, to those ivho can see !”
*’ Then how appeareth he ?”
“In thee, 0 One! 0 Mighty One! 0 Thrice
Mighty One'!” \ <■ -
‘ ‘ Turn thou then, O men of the Circles, men of
the mighty Ring, whose meaning is Unity in
Infinity, and do homage to thy chief, to the vice-
gereht of thy-Lord ! Turn thou ! Turn thou !”
The men of the Circles, the noiseless patrol,
faced the Conclave, and in the next instant cried
as with one voice
“ To thee our Lord Satan do ice homage !”
As they cried their hands were upraised. That
much could have..been observed, for in that same
moment a lurid, illumination blazed suddenly
upon the scene and hung a garland of flame upon
the brows of these human demons.
Through the .eye-orbits of a human skull appa-
rently suspended in mid-air, through the opened
jaws, through the nasal cavities, and from every
fragment of the bony box that had once held the
secrets of a human brain, grinned a phosphorescent
glare. A mere bit of theatrical mummery, it had
a diabolic effect upon weakened nerves already
prepared by an incantation muttered in the solemn
hush of midnight to be sympathetically impressed.
It stamped the seal of supernaturalism upon the

It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
just the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

ceremonial, and in the perversion of moral sense
which characterised the “ Black Norfolkers ” as it
has marked no other community these hundreds
of years, it was welcomed with a thrill that had
more in keeping with a sensual pleasure than a
retributary terror.
# * *
With the fading of the light the Conclave
passed into its most secret stage.
The formal report of the voting in'the “Session
of Denunciation ” was delivered to the “ One ” by
Johnson, the leader who had presided. And the
“ One ” required of the “ Three ” by their oath to
him and the Ring, whether the condemned Henry
Reynell had had a fair trial according to the
Society’s usage ?
And two of the “Three ” affirmed that he had,
Peake, the third man of the “Three,” as the
accuser, was silent.
“Had the accused been notified that he had
been condemned after the trial and in due form?”
Peake affirmed he had borne the message of
condemnation “ with truth, without prejudice,
without fear, and without favour.” The message
had been of necessity sent through Peake, although
he was Reynell’s prosecutor, because Peake was
the “Threer” having earliest access to the con-
demned.
“And the condemned 1 Does he appeal? ”
“No. By his oath to the Society, admits he
forfeited allegiance by promising to be true man
to an establishment officer, but craves if.the doom
be death, one favour.”
“What?”
“ That he may not be drowned or strangled, but
that having been a soldier, he may be shot or
stabbed. ”
Then, after a pause, which held possession of
this temple of damned souls as does the tragic
interval before the anathema claim the vast spaces
of a cathedral of the Church in the hour of ex-
communication, the “One” pronounced the
Doom.
“ By,the power that is mine, by the authority
conferred upon one by our dread society of the
Ring do I issue my fiat to and make order of doom
upon Brother Henry Reynell under bond to the
Crown, upon the Crown’s register No. 37-889 per
colonial ship Coquette, and upon the roll of the
Society for this year current, No. 12 of our Circle
of Seven.
“ And the Doom is That he shall die the death ! ”
“So be it, 0 One! So be thy hat obeyed, O
Mighty One! So be thy order of Doom completed,
O Thrice Mighty One!” Thus, in their argot,
responded the “ Three;” and when their murmur
had been swallowed by the silence the “One”
went on :
“ Who, of his brethren of the Ring, stands
nearest to the condemned Henry Reynell in
brotherly affection—to whom is he most dear? ”
Quaking, shiveringly, Peake made answer :
“ William Felix, under bond to the Crown, and
on the Crown’s register. No. 39-204, on our roll,
No. 20 of Circle of ‘ Nine,’stands nearest to the
Condemned.”
“ Speaketh the deponent truly ? ”
“ The deponent brother speaketh truly within
our knowledge,” confirmed the others of the
“ Three.”,
“Then let the warrant of doom go forth to
Brother William Felix, No. 20 of our Circle of
“ Nine,” that he shall do the deed of death within
the circling of a moon’s orbit upon his brother the
condemned by act of shooting or by act of stabbing,
though the testimony be true that the condemned
is near to him and dear to him—aye, though the
condemned be bone of his bone, blood of his blood,
flesh of his flesh, let him do the deed, on peril of
his suffering like doom. And from this fiat shall
there be no appeal, because—”
The “ One ” waited for the antiphon. It came
solemnly from the “ Three ” :
“Our society has been wounded and it heals its
hurt by blood.”
“So cut we off all traitors! So doom we all
that ally themselves to the Law which persecuteth
us—the Law which hath given us over to the living
death !”
“ So cut we off all traitors ! So doom we all that
ally themselves to our persecutors /”
# # #
Then proceeded to its conclusion this
mummery. Its rites and ceremonies—the devices
of ingenious and fertile minds compelled by
Fate to that most Sisyphian of all tortures, the
working upon themselves for want of an outlet for
their inventive and imaginative faculties; or of
souls capable of forging thunderbolts and of vent-
ing forked lightnings, but condemned by society to
the unrelieved, hopeless misery of petty taskwork
—were, as yet, incomplete.
The “One” had to travesty in blasphemous
syllables the prayer commonly used at Norfolk
Island executions when a Protestant was to be
hanged. The original prayer was this :
“ Oh, Almighty God, who according to the magnitude
of Thy mercies dost so truly put away the sins of those
which truly repent, that Thou rememberest them no
more, Open Thine eyes upon this Thy servant who most
earnestly desireth pardon and forgiveness. Remember
him, most Loving Father ; whatsoever hath been declared
in him by the fraud and malice of the Devil or by his own
carnal wilfulness, do Thou forgive.” ....
The infamous parody of that pathetic appeal as
recited by the “One,” dare not be qu ted.
Invert every petition of the original; substitute
the name of the Adversary for that of the Deity ;
invoke as the cause of the victim’s ruin and death
the loving kindness of God and the benignity of
British Justice, and you will have a faint idea of
the prayer he used. The parody was the richest
fruit of the System. Were you to clothe with
literarv form the mouthings of the creatures led
by Hebert, as they danced round Lais and
Phryne enthroned as Goddesses of Reason on the
desecrated Church altars of Revolutionary Paris,
you would scarcely parallel it in point of blas-
phemous horror.
The recitation ended, the “ One ” and “ Three ”
commended themselves and the Ring to the care
of the Lord of Evil, and, finally—the Circles
being once more bade to do homage—the Convict
Oath was chanted in chorus. With foot against
foot and palm meeting in palm, the Bond of
Obligation was renewed.
Only—there was no drinking of blood from one
another’s pin-pricked veins. Was it because of
the darkness that the libation was omitted? Was
it because time was passing?
No; the blood was not drunk because in the
presence of a superior infamy, an inferior shame
is superfluous.
# * *
A Conclave of Doom, at which was
marked the period of some Ringer’s life, fulfilled
yet another awful function. It at once elected
someone to the newly-created vacancy. There
were always waiting aspirants for admission to
each circle from the grade below it. The
man eligible for promotion from the novices
or uninitiates, was almost invariably in attend-
ance, but if his presence could not be secured—
say, because he was gaol, in Longiidge Barracks,
or at the Cascades—he was admitted by proxy,
the proxy, one of the initiates, being compelled to
administer the rite to the newly-elected at the
earliest opportunity.
Now, Reynell being a “Sevener,” the vacancy
in Seven Circle had to be filled by the appoint-
ment of a “ Niner.”
Felix, the nominated executioner, was chosen.
This step followed the usage. The executioner,
having at supreme risk obeyed the Ring, was
worthy of promotion if the deed of death created
a vacancy.
To fill Felix’s place and thus complete “ Nine ”
circle, a novice was called up by name from the
silent, wearied, but docile throng by the door.
As the wretch stumbled in the darkness up the
length of the uneven boards towards the first line
of patrols, his movements were followed by a
plaintive wail from Sammy Ward.
“ Aint you going to elect me? It’s my turn !”
And he was hardly stopped by the smothered
exclamations which burst from those equally
unprivileged with himself. “Hush, you fool!
hush !”
The newly-honoured convict reached the first
patrol. There he was stripped—and passed on.
When he came within arm’s reach of the
“ Three,” the flash of the bull’s-eye blazed into his
face, and, for an instant, blinded him. This
was done to identify him. Once, two years
before, when a man had been called from the
outsiders to be graced with his new honours he
grew, at the last moment, craven. The man next
him whispered that he would go in his stead.
He did so, and—up to that night the lantern had
not been used for that last flash of identification
was initiated beneath the cloak of darkness. The
next day he claimed, as he was entitled to do by
his rights of admission, instruction in the “cant ”
language from an elder member of the ring. Then
he stood revealed as one who had fraudulently ob-
tained admission to their mysteries. The morn-
ing following, he was found dead in his bed-
place. Obviously strangled, “but what was the
use of an enquiry ?” questioned the Acting-Com-
mandant Bunbury. “To hang the murderer we
should have had to hang 120 men !” So the flash
of identification became necessary.
The man passed the scrutiny—he was the right
one, the one who had been called and chosen, and
he was initiated.
Gagged in the moment when the light blazed in
his fa° e , he could but writhe in the grasp of two

Ifc was three in the morning before Peake
reached the hut on 5 B Farm. His hutmates—
Reynell, Osborne, “Barrington,” and Felix—
were waiting for him in a weird, Rembrandtesque
half-light—waiting for the news of the doom. I n
his walk from the Iron Room to the farm he had
passed three sentry-posts; but the “One” had
given the countersign at each, and the quiver of
trepidation with which Peake had come within
range of each soldier’s musket had proved quite
unnecessary.
Not so, perhaps, the spasm which shook him
when he re-entered the hut. The exhilaration of
the ceremony had evaporated and his sense of
duty to the Ring was overlain by his awakened
remorse that he had betrayed to the death the
man who had become surety for his good conduct,
and had thereby obtained for him comparative
freedom. From the remorse sprang the dread
that Reynell—already on his way to the grave—
might avenge his betrayal on the betrayer. What
would Reynell do?
For some moments after Peake entered no one
spoke. Then the condemned broke silence,
“Is it—doom, Peake?” he asked,
Peake nodded.
“Who,” stammeringly questioned Osborne,
“ who is the Ketch?”
Peake, with a trembling forefinger, pointed to
ob * - . . .
Felix, great hulking lout, bent himself in the
shadows, and covered his face with his gnarled
hands.
“ An’l’ad promised to be true man for ever an’
a day, ’Arry ! Yo brought me here, ’Arry, an’
rid me o’ the domned clinks, an’ it’s me that’s to
kill tho. I Tidn’t do it !” He half-said, half-
groaned these words.
»»
“An’ I’d tak it ’fore I’d break my oath to
’Arry yonder. I’m his sworn man.”
“ Yer the Ring’s man first!” insisted Osborne.


Judge Stephen, (N.S.W.) the other day,
during the hearing of a horse-stealing ease in
which the term “brumbies” (wild horses) had
been frequently used, suddenly stopped the pro-
ceedings to explain that, up till that moment, he
had evidently been under a misconception of the
word quoted above, as he had innocently imagined
that “ brumbies ” were “ horses belonging to a Mr.
Brumby.”

Two human skeletons in a good state of
preservation have been found on Gem Island in the
Abrolhos, and are presumed to be remnants of
Pelsart’s ill-starred expedition, which so narrowly
escaped making Australia a Dutch colony in the
sixteenth century. Providence, on that occasion,
was evidently watching over the great -Anglo-
Saxon race. Most of Pelsart’s little fleet vanished
in a storm, and the rest went to utter smash on
the lonely Abrolhos. Then the commander went
on a long voyage in an open boat to fetch assist-
ance, and in his absence Cornelis founded a
monarchy and a big civil war on these barren
rocks; and when three-fourths of the party had
been extirpated Pelsart came back, and hanged the
new king and his principal followers on a com-
modious gallows, and went home again, leaving
Australia for the English who were to come.

“ Ay, that war I; but there’s a way to obey th’
Ring, an’ keep my oath to ’Arry too !”
■b* jjfr
On the morrow —rather, at a later hour
that same day—while the sub-gang were absent
at ma'ze-tioeing, an Establishment officer visited
the hut. Save him, no man entered the hut
between the time of the gangers leaving it and
their return. Yet when they came back for their
noon-tide food, one and all of them—fellows who
would have laughed at death had it come from
Law and the authorities —changed colour as they
saw on the stone table a
scrap of folded paper.
On the outside of the
paper was inscribed a
single circle, with the
figures “20” in its centre.
On the inside there
was no word. Only
there were inscribed two
circles, so ;
In the common centre
of these was the roll-
number of Henry Rey-
nell—“No. 12.”
And below this symbol
of the personality of the
condemned was, stamped
in candle-smoke this :
It was the “One’s”
signature to his order of
doom upon Henry Rey-
nell, “No. 12 ’ of Circle
‘ ‘ Seven, ’’and the warrant
was addressed to “No.
20 ”of Circle “ Nine ”■—William Felix. It was
his roll-symbol which was marked on the outside
of the paper. §
* * *
How Felix obeyed the warrant, and yet
kept faithful to his vow to be sworn man to
Reynell will be told next time.
§ For these illustrations of the symbolism of the Ring
—indeed, for almost the whole of his knowledge of the
secret society’s ritual and ceremonial—the writer is in-
debted to a venerable (using- the word in its sense) man-
who, though an ex-“Novfolker,” was an esteemed corres-
pondent of the late Dr. Ullathorne, R.C. Archbishop of
Birmingham, up to the very month of the great ecclesi-
astic’s death. The ex-convict’s autobiography is in the
possession of the writer, and may be given to the world
within a year or two.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Oh ! who will bear the battle’s brunt
And lead the ranks of Labour ?
Our leaders blunder in the front
While Victory’s a neighbour !
We need a man to guide us thro’—
The march is rough and hilly—-
The army wants to know if you
Are coining, Charlie Lilley ?
The hand of Greed is on the soil
And times are growing harder,
And soon ’twill break the heart of Toil
To fill the workman’s larder.
Across the sky we hear the cry
Of Justice calling shrilly,
And we might save her by and by
If led by Charlie Lilley.
We want the gentleman who’ll face
The social sham and evil
And sacrifice a higher place
To seek the people’s level.
The parasite ne’er led the van
To Victory—nor will lie ;
To lead us on we need a man
Like brave old Charlie Lilley.
So, Charlie Lilley, will you dare
The lying papers’ fury,
With God alone to judge you fair,
The people for a jury.
Can heart like yours keep warm and true
On heights where hearts are chilly ?
The people want to know if you
Are coming, Chai’lie Lilley.

Corny Bill.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
His old clay pipe stuck in his mouth, *
Ilis hat pushed from his brow, ‘
His dress best fitted for the Souths '( '
I think I.see him now • . ,
And wlien the city streets are still,
And sleep upon me comes, . ,
I often dream that me an’ Bill
Are humpin’ of out drums.
.1 mind the time"when first I came ' ;
A stranger to the land ;
And I was stump’d, an’ sick,. an’Jam'o >
When Bill took me. in hand. .
Old Bill was what a chap would call
A friend in poverty, ■ . . ■ ? . : .
And he ttas very kind to ail— ' ■
And very good to me. ; • • -
We’d camp beneath the lonely trees
And sit beside the blaze
A nursin’ of our wearied knees ’ :
A-smokin’ of our clays.
Or when we’d journeyed, damp-, aji’.faiy - -
An’ clouds were in the skies,
We’d-camp in some, bar.
And sit a-telfin’ lies; ’ . , (
Tho’ time had wjdtjupon hSs h#ow y
And smootlied away his curls,
He always was—an’may-be now, . ■
A fav’rite with the girls •
I’ve heard bnsh-wimmin scream an’ squall
.- I’ve see’d ’em laugh until
They could not do their work at all,
Because of Corny Bill.
He was the j oiliest old pup
As ever you did see,
And often at some bush kick-up
They’d make old Bill M;C.
He’d make them dance and sing all night/
He’d make the music hum,
But he’d be gone at mornin’ light. ; ;
A-humpin’ of his drum. .
The joys of which the poet rhymes
Was not for Bill an’ me; ‘ -
I think-we hud some good’old times' ' ‘
Out on the wallaby.
I took a wife and left off rum,
An’ camp’d beneath a roof;
But Bill preferred to hump his drum
A-paddin’ of the hoof.
The lazy, idle loafers what
In toney houses camp, -
Would call old Bill a drunken Sot,
A loafer-, or a tramp.; . ', :‘ .
But if the dead should ever dance—
As poets say they will—
I think I’d rather take my chance
Along of Corny Bill.
His long life’s-day is nearly o’er,
Its shades begin to fall;
He soon must mount his bluey for
The last long tramp of all;
I trust that when, in bush an’ town,
He’s lived and learnt his till,
They’ll lot the golden slip-rails down
For poor old Corny Bill.

S:r William Macleay’s will.
On Eight Hours’ Day President Harwood,
of Melbourne Trades Hall, wept tears of joy
because Governor Hopetoun had acknowledged
roiygh workmen “ by stepping down from’his high
station to honour a gathering of the workers with
his presence as the representative of Her Majesty
the Queen.” Until the spokesmen of the workers
cease talking faddle of this kind they will continue
to beg the whole question.
Pritchard Morgan (says our London cor-
respondent), having sternly refused to pay the
costs of the action brought against him by the
Government for the recovery of mining royalties,
a bailiff has seized the Dolgelly gold-mine, and
another is in possession of Brintyrion Hall, which
is the pretentious name of the Queensland Welsh-
man’s residence in the principality. A cable
received since states that the matter has been
arranged. .
In his controversy with Justice Hodges,
Attorney-General Duffy (Vic.) adds that “one
day public opinion may compel the legislature to
confine Judges to the interpretation of thelawand
to give to juries the power of determining sen-
tence, understanding that though Judges are more
learned in the law than juries juries are often
gifted with more practical ability and greater
common-sense than some Judges.” This is so
obvious a truism that it is quite a pity that Mr.
Duffy didn’t endeavour to bring the system into
effect.
A cow-milking machine, the joint inven-
tion of two hard, prosaic Scotchmen, is about to
be introduced into Australia. A long india-
rubber tube can be laid on to any reasonable
number of cows at once, which done, the milk is
abstracted by means of an air-pump and flows into
a reservoir, where a steam-power butter-maker
converts it into pats of “ the best fresh ” while you
wait. The maid who carries the milking-pail is
rapidly becoming irrelevant, and the cow who
always kicks the bucket over can consider herself
powerless to prevent the march of science.
The Eucalypte Lozenges for colds, made by
Colemane and Sons, are unsurpassed.

1 he public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
■ started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
arm has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence .and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues,the cue phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper. . . . ,
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the motiopoTies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause, of half the
misery .which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
.The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian jouTnals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The- Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Beecham’s Pills
PATENT
PILLS.
Are universally admitted
to be worth a Guinea
a Box for bilioua
and nervous disorders,
such as wind and pain in
the stomach, sick head-
ache, giddiness, fulness
and swelling after meals,
dizziness, and drowsiness,
cold chills, flushings of
heat, loss of appetite,
shortness of breath, cos-
tiveness, scurvy, blotches
on the skin, disturbed
sleep, frightful dreams,
and all nervous and trem-
bling sensations, &o. The
first dose will give relief
in twenty minutes. Every
sufferer is earnestly invited to try one box of these
Pills, and they will he acknowledged to be

For females of all ages these Pills are invaluably,
as a few doses of them carry off all humors, and

be without them. There is no medicine to be found
equal to BEECHAM’S PILLS for removing any
obstruction or irregularity of the system. If taken ac-
cording to the directions given with each box they will
soon restore females of all ages to sound and robust
health. This has been proved by thousands who have
tried them, and found the benefits which are ensured by
their use
For a weak stomach, impaired digestion and all disorders
of the liver, they act like “ MAGIC,” and a few doses will
be found to work wonders upon the most important
organs in the human machine. They strengthen the
whole muscular system, restore the long-lost complexion,
bring back the keen edge of appetite, and arouse into ac-
tion with the ROSEBUD of health the whole physical
energy of the human frame. These are “FACTS” testified
continually by members of all classes of society ; and
one of the best guarantees to the nervous and debilitated
is, Beecham’s Pills have the largest sale of any patent
medicine in the world.
Beecham’s Magic Cough. Pills.
