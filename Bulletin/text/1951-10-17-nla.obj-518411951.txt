ETON COLLEGE, BEST KNOWN OF ENGLAND’S PUBLIC SCHOOLS
ON the north bank of the Thames, opposite Windsor Castle, is Eton College.
It was founded by Henry VI, who was only eighteen years old when he
first began to plan the College and only twenty when he laid the foundation
stone of the Chapel in 1441. The Lower School is the original Eton school-
room, and is probably the oldest schoolroom in continuous use in Britain. The
Upper School was completed in 1694, and Lupton’s Tower, shown in this
photograph, was built at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
Many of the later Sovereigns of England have taken a personal interest
in the school, notably George 111 (1760-1820), whose birthday is commemorated
by the annual 4th of June celebrations. The traditional dress of top-hat and
tail-coat were first worn as mourning at the death of George 111 in place
of the seventeenth-century uniform of blue coat, knee-breeches and white
waistcoat.
The college was originally founded to provide education for “poor and
needy scholars,” but after the Wars of the Roses the provost and headmaster
found it necessary to supplement their diminished salaries by admitting the
sons of wealthy parents, who paid fees and boarded with Fellows, or in the
town of Eton, and were known as Oppidans, in contrast with the Collegers,
provided for by the founder. Today, the students of Eton consist of 70
Collegers who obtain scholarships by open competition, and about 1100
Oppidans who live at the masters’ houses.
In 1834, it is recorded that “the inmates of a workhouse or a gaol are
better fed and lodged than the scholars of Eton.” So great was the over-
crowding that some of the boys had to sleep on the floor, and the only
provision for washing was an old pump in the cloisters. The annual cleaning
took the form of “rug-riding,” when Lower boys were tied up in rugs and
dragged up and down the floor by the older boys.
In spite of a certain amount of hardship in former days, Eton has
contributed, throughout its long history, a larger proportion of men who later
won distinction in every field of endeavour, than any other school in England.
Walpole, Pitt, Grenville, North, Chatham, Fox, Gladstone, Shelley, Thomas
Gray, Balfour and Wellington are but a few of the innumerable Eton scholars
who later became world-famous.

STILL WATERS.
In calling his memoirs Much Besides
Music (Georgian House), Thor old
Waters does not exaggerate; he has been
a reporter, aged fourteen, on the
“Balmain Leader”; reporter travelling
with the Royal party during the
ceremonies of 1901 ; political lobbyist
for the Melbourne “Age” ; professional
singer in Britain; Inspector of special
constables in London in World War I,
then infantry officer in Egypt; post-war
London representative of papers in Aus-
tralia and New Zealand ; reporter at the
inception of the League of Nations ; and,
in Melbourne during the past twenty-five
years, music critic, daily-paper paragra-
phist, light-verse writer, adjudicator at
eisteddfods, discoverer of Marjorie
Lawrence (she says, he weakly denies),
etc.
In his Balmain days. Waters hob-
nobbed with a young Welshman called
Hughes, at that time running a moribund
Balmain second-hand bookshop; there,
too, he met another young man called
Holman: these two plotters told him
much about Henry George and Bellamy’s
Looking Backwards, and later made him
Government Whip in Holman’s first
Ministry—in Sydney School of Arts
amateur Union Parli a m e n t—where
Hughes was one of the Ministers. Waters
bought all Hughes’s books for six shillings
—“You got some brain fodder and I got
a meal. I needed it pretty badly,” Billy
told him years later in London. Waters
carried the books home armful by
armful, leaving only one large heavy
volume as too much trouble —Gould’s
Birds of Australia, which, years later, he
discovered would have been worth at
least £lOO.
Moreover, Sir Henry Parkes patted
him on the back after his speech in reply
to a Press toast at a political banquet;
and Griffo clouted him across the cheek
“in resentment of my watching some
drunken antics of his outside the hotel
and boxing saloon of Larry Foley in
George-street, Sydney.”
Waters, then on the Sydney “Tele-
graph,” recommended Frank Morton to
be editor of the Bathurst “Advocate”
(recently famous as Mr. Chifley’s paper),
and after one day there Morton was
fired, and walked the 135 miles back to
Sydney ; thereafter Waters himself took
the editorship, having for reporter young
William Henry Donald, who later advised
Chiang Kai-shek on the running of
China.
During the Boer War, a reporter on
Melbourne “Age,” Waters intercepted the
Nineveh at sea to get news; a case of
smallpox was diagnosed aboard ; and his
dispatches had to be sterilised in whisky
—“more cheaply come by than now.”
Scotch, too, it must have been.
About the best chapter in the book,
“King David Slings His Pebbles,” ex-
plains what it was like to be political
lobbyist on the “Age” in the days of
David Syme:
Without his surly sanction no Premier
had taken office and no Cabinet personnel
had been brought together for twenty
years or more; no doubt he envisaged a
similar overlordship in the Federal sphere,
but Prime Minister Barton and his stal-
wart lieutenants, Charles Cameron Kingston,
John Forrest and W. J. Lyne, were men
beyond his reach.
Indeed, young Mr. Waters had come in
on the end of the reign, even in the Vic-
torian sphere, for Premier Irvine, “The
Iceberg,” whom he was to chronicle,
owed no allegiance to Syme; and the
next Premier was Bent, of whom Syme
had said, “Let the dead past bury its
dead.” At first Bent had been con-
sidered for the job as leader of the Labor
party:
George Prendergast, Labor Premier
twenty years later, asked what I thought of
the idea. He showed me his party’s then
leader, sprawling intoxicated on a coUch in
the lobby.
The chapter is full of such revealing
little touches, as on the night Waters fol-
lowed Premier Bent from Cabinet-room
to the Oriental bar, and then to a
Chinese restaurant, to get the findings of
a Royal Commission on some charges
against Sir Alexander Peacock, which
Bent had promised exclusively to the
“Age.” Waters dropped back to his
office to dictate some odds and ends of
news to “a fledgling reporter who is now
Sir Keith Murdoch,” and when he
returned to the “Chow supper place,” the
reporters representing other papers had
given up and gone, except Davidson of
the “Argus,” and Fox, subsequently of
The Bulletin and later Sir Frank Fox:
Fox said blandly, “Well, Mr. Bent,
aren’t you going to let us have that Peacock
report tonight?”
Davidson immediately chipped in, “Yes,
Mr. Bent, and I’m authorised to tell you
that if the ‘Argus’ comes out tomorrow
without the report the Attorney-General
just slipped into Mr. Waters’s overcoat
pocket the paper’s policy towards your
Government will be reversed.”
Mr. Waters ventures to disagree with
the laudatory biography of Syme by his
former leader-writer, Ambrose Pratt, and
with the foreword by another of his
former leader-writers, Alfred Deakin.
Waters says;
Those actions to which I was privy did
convince me that no man can amass great
wealth, landed estates and commercial
interests, and have his fingers in most pies
of profit, without an infusion of private
motives into his public acts.
To Tom Roberts, who painted the
Royal Proclamation from under the
dome of the Exhibition Building “for
presentation to Edward VII (and now
where is it?),” Waters humorously pro-
tested that eminent citizens had been sub-
stituted for the Pressmen who had had
good seats at the function. Said
Roberts:
“You’ve no idea how many hundreds of
people strove to get themselves painted into
that picture. Some offered me nice cheques.
Of course I was given a list of those to be
exalted, drawn up for me by the Barton
Government and its underlings. It had to
be whittled down quite a lot to get the
people right-sized. And about the only
fellow in the bunch worth remembering
was David Syme.”
“Was he in the building at all?”
“Now you’ve got me!” said the artist.
Then he added whimsically, “Well, if any
money changed hands, it didn’t roll my
way.”
That a journalist might wish to leave
the Victorian political scene to become a
singer in London is not so surprising,
perhaps, as that he succeeded; the
Chapters dealing with the years between
1904 and 1914 are full of music: a per-
formance of “Don Giovanni” with
Caruso, Journet, Antonio Scotti and
Destinn ; singing tours of the provinces ;
Waters singing in “Tannhauser” at the
Old Vic.; and touring with the Denhof
Opera Company ; London’s Irish turning
iip to barrack for John McCormack ; the
“You-Be-Quiet-Club” over a piano ware-
house near Bond-street, attended by Sir
Edward Elgar, Sir Hubert Parry, Sir
Alexander McKenzie and Sir Frederick
Cowen, where, in a near-by room, Waters
was coached in oratorio by the conductor
Arthur Fagge, who would settle some
point of interpretation by dodging in to
“see Sir Edward about that,” and coming
back remarking, “Says it’ll be 0.K.,” or
else shaking’ his head.
As a climax to these memories, Mr.
Waters prints for the first time a series of
letters from Melba to Signor Pietro
Cecchi, written from North Queensland,
Sydney and Leicester (England), to back
his contention that Cecchi of Melbourne
deserved as much credit for teaching
Melba as did Madame Marchesi of
Paris, of whom he has several hard things
to say.
Into this musical atmosphere intrude
famous Australians abroad: Deakin,
over for the Imperial Conference, where
he outshone the other delegates ; Andrew
Fisher travelling with Keir Hardie, with
whom he had worked in a coalmine
when they were ten or eleven years old;
Billy Hughes, after the war, raging in
Australia House for a private secretary
who could always placate him with a
risque story heard at lunch; Monash
turning down an offer to be Victorian
Railways Commissioner at £5OOO a year
and taking instead the direction of the
State Electricity Commission at £3OOO a
year: “It’s tempting, but I won’t accept
it. I would like to do some really
national job for the future of Australia.
There’s nothing further to be done with
railways. They’re at their last ditch.”
And E. G. Theodore, then Premier of
Queensland, quietly informing a group of
London financiers who had organised to
deprive him of loan-money that he had
made arrangements for a dollar loan on
his way through America. And —a phase
of merchanting after World War I that
was revived in London and Sydney only
this year:
We live in Insanity Fair, yet sometimes
there is a wave of sanity, even among
women as a herd One spread across
London quietly, telepathically, utterly with-
out organisation, when to a woman they
ceased as at an arranged signal their buying
at inordinate prices. One week all the great
clothes emporiums teemed with the sex;
the next week the establishments could as
well be in the desert.... The first man to
recognise its coming was the supreme
“merchant venturer” of the centuiy, Gordon
Selfridge. He announced that, in view of
the stalling of patronage, all softgoodS
merchandised in his famous store would
be reduced forthwith by five per cent.
Another scene is of Hawker landing in
a triplane on Hounslow Heath to say
good-bye to his friend Captain Matthews
at the start of the England-Australia air-
race. His plane snapped off its propeller-
ends in the stubble while taxi-ing:
After a few words Hawker went back to
his own triplane (did such contrivances
exist?) looked at his propeller-blades, took
out a big penknife, hacked off portions to
even them, gave Matthews a hand-grip, and
was up and away.
After all this, twenty or so years of
music-criticism in Australia must seem
a little thin, and Mr, Waters has kept it
short, and enlivened it with anecdotes of
visitors like Grainger, Szigeti, Toti dal
Monte (who ate her own dinner and his,
too), and Kreisler ; and of Australian
discoveries like Marjorie Lawrence ; and
of the dangers to which adjudicators are
open from unsuccessful competitors, as
when Maurice Besly, Fritz Hart and a
Cathedral organist were pinned in a train
compartment corner all the way from
Ballarat to Melbourne by a choir which
they had restricted to second place.
There qre also some memories of
Lawson, E. J. Brady, “Price Waning”
(William Astiey) and other Bulletin
writers ; a defence of Victor Daley from
the charge that he was not a true
Bohemian ; half a chapter on Archibald,
and some tributes to his Bulletin.
DETAIL FROM AN
ANNUNCIATION BY CRIVELLI
My sisters played beyond the doorway.
My mother bade me hush and go,
I did not think that any saw me
I went so still on tip of toe.
My sisters played beneath the olives,
They called like birds from tree to tree;
I climbed the stairs and through the
archway
Looked where no one else could see.
My hair hung straight beneath my cap,
My dress hung down in fold on fold,
And when the painter filled it in
He edged it round with strokes of gold.
My mother thought I played without,
My sisters thought i stayed within.
Only the painter saw me hide—
His brush held upwards to begin.
I saw the Dove, I saw the Lady
Cross her hands upon her breast,
I heard a music, and a shining
Came upon my eyes to rest.
I am twelve, but 1 was eight then:
No one listens when 1 tell—
Least of all my little sisters—
What 1 saw and what befell.
Look upon the painter’s picture.
See, he shows you where I hid,
What 1 saw, and how Mistened—•
You believe me that I did?

ROSEMARY DOBSON.
History of the R.A.N.
Rear-Admiral Henry Feakes, in his
White Ensign-Southern Cross (Ure
Smith Pty. Ltd.), is unfortunate in
several directions. First, Frances Mc-
Guire’s Royal Australian Navy, her
husband Paul’s Price of Admiralty,
F. B. Eldridge’s History of the R.A.N.
College and The Background to Eastern
Sea-Power, have all been published in
Australia since War IPs end, and all deal,
more or less, with the Admiral’s subject
—the birth of our Navy.
Second, it is unfortunate that such a
refreshing style as this blue-waterman’s
should have been directed to a subject so
fully covered. The author (he died before
his book was published) had apparently
been all his Service life a keen, analytical
and detached student of colonial naval
development,
In his book he stands back, clear of the
smoke of customary naval prejudice, and
every now and then delivers a delightful
broadside on Service shortcomings: his
feelings as a Jowly cadet in “one of the
oldest, crustiest and most conservative of
Service clubs, the United Services, Pall
Mall, lunching under the hostile glances
from fierce, shaggy eyebrows”; the
almost fanatical clinging to the privileges
of seniority—“two infant cadets, each
anxious to establish and exercise his
authority as senior to the other, and one
claiming to have joined by an earlier
train!” And there is, while going into
meticulous detail on the early history of
our Navy, the well-documented disclosure
of the birth of that important evolution,
the growth of beards.
Admiral Feakes’s book is unfortunate
in one more direction ; that such a highly-
entertaining and easy-to-read tale should
end before his Navy entered upon its
greatest adventure—World War 11.
Ballet in Australia.
Australian Notes on the Ballet by Jean
Garling (Legend Press, Sydney) briefly
surveys the history of ballet in this
country, which in one form or another
has been performed from the beginning
of theatrical history.
Dancing interludes, finales and
harlequinades were common to most
dramatic productions from the earliest
days. In Sydney in 1833 Cavendish de
Castell opened a dancing-school in
Macquarie-street, teaching gavottes,
minuets, boleros and Circassian circles.
Signor Della Casa introduced tightrope
dances in 1842. His little pupils per-
formed “with a look of terror on their
tender faces.”
The first touring soloist to leave an im-
pression was Lola Montez, whose “play-
fulness and piquancy nearly drove the
audience frantic.” A host of dancers and
companies subsequently visited Australia,
but it was not until 1926, when Pavlova
brought a new concept of ballet, that the
ballet became of real interest to local
audiences. After that the story is, of
course, of famous visiting companies,
such. as De Basil’s, and the development
of local companies such as Borovansky’s.
Miss Garling tells her story concisely
but entertainingly and with evident
knowledge of the subject. The book is
well illustrated with sketches by Daryl
Lindsay and William Constable,
Propaganda Novel.
Like Power Without Glory and the
later novels of Katharine Susannah
Prichard, Eric Lambert’s The Twenty
Thousand Thieves (Newmont, Mel-
bourne) offers almost insuperable diffi-
culties to a reviewer who likes to regard
a novel, irrespective of its politics, as a
work of art
Writing about soldiers at Tobruk, Mr,
Lambert draws his material directly from
the history of the last 10 years ; and
really it is hardly possible to think about
the purely literary qualities of his book,
such as they are, when one is continually
being confronted with the most mis-
chievous and outrageous distortions of
historical fact, all closely following the
Communist party-line.
Thus you have a woman supposed to
be writing from Australia to her grand-
son in Tobruk and saying, “They [the
common run of humanity] called for war
against Germany. Churchill answered
them. Curtin did out here”; and, of
course, it was Chamberlain and Mr.
Menzies who, as a matter of historical
fact, had to undertake the grave respon-
sibility of declaring war on Germany.
You have a soldier asking, “When’s the
British Army going to land in France?
and another soldier, a Communist, answer-
ing amidst apparently general approval,
“The day before the war ends”; and one
remembers that the British and American
armies did, in fact, land quite a time
before then and do some fighting which
was considerably more use to Russia than
Russia’s entry into the Pacific War —four
hours after Japan had sued for peace—
was of use to Australia.
Mr. Lambert could say, of course, that
this is not the author talking, but his
characters. But it is Mr. Lambert him-
self who says of his “anti-fascist” officer,
Henry Gilbertson:
Henry was an anti-fascist: this was his
sole reason for being in the army. In this
he considered he stood apart from his
brother officers. Had not some of them
regretted in his hearing that they weren’t
the allies of the Nazis against Russia?
And Mr. Lambert, if he had looked at
his own dates a little more carefully—
his mythical Second X soldiers arrive in
Palestine in January, 1941, and this dis-
quisition on Henry Gilbertson occurs
some six or seven weeks later — should
have known that Hitler did not attack
Russia until June, 1941. In the period
of which he is writing his Australian
officers would have had to be, like the
Communists on the home front, the allies
of the Nazis with Russia.
Apart from direct propaganda of this
kind, and apart from the fact that the
action is carefully manipulated to propa-
gandist ends —the most likeable of the
private soldiers, nicknamed Go Through,
is, for example, killed as the result of
the folly of one of Mr. Lambert’s detested
officers, Colonel Fitzroy— The Twent)
Thousand Thieves is not without some
merits as a novel. It is frank in dialogue
and the sex scenes, but not unhealthily

CURSES FROM EGYPT.
With most survivors of the First A.I.F.
—which occupied Egypt in 1914-15 while
training for war against more serious
military annoyances then prevailing —the
memories of Egypt are ineffaceable and
often unprintable. The Diggers’ irre-
sponsible attitude, gaily impenitent then
before Cairo mobs and British generals
alike, is doubtless inappropriate today ;
though nobody will convince any of the
gone-but-not-forgotten Australian Light
Horse that a resuscitated brigade of those
efficient repressors of other people’s ex-
cesses could not within a few hours make
the Nile delta safe again for democracy.
The very idea of such a course in these
days of U.N.O. worship is highly repre-
hensible. Nevertheless, the ignoring of
such sentiment would be a serious omis-
sion in any reflection of Australian
public opinion upon the Egyptian Par-
liament’s decision to denounce the treaty
covering the defence of the Suez Canal
and the status of the Sudan, drive the
British off the Suez Canal (they suppose)
and out of the Sudan, and defy anybody
and everybody who would withstand an
enraged Egyptian nation.
Presumably the organisers of these
intolerable insults to a Britain which has
made them prosperous beyond their
fondest dreams will have overreached
themselves if —as seems likely—they have
made a certainty of the defeat of the
Attlee Government at the British elec-
tions next week.
The Egyptians have some lost “face”
to restore. When a couple of years ago
the reconditioned Egyptian Army went to
war with its ancient Israelite foe, King
Farouk’s forces got such a thrashing that
they did not stop running till they arrived
behind the British garrison on the Suez
Canal. From that safe position the
Egyptians started blockading the canal
against ships with cargoes consigned for
Israeli ports and continue to defy a U.N.
judgment ordering them to lift the block-
ade. However, the military disgrace in
the Negeb is evidently fading from the
Gyppo mind under the influence of
various encouraging events. King
Farouk on his honeymoon has broken
faro-banks along the northern Mediter-
ranean coast; a 17-stone subject of his
won an international swimming-race
across the English Channel —“for my
King and country,” he said ; “our team
was ordered to win whatever happened” ;
and Moscow has been trying the effect
of alternate blandishments and threats as
means of winning Egypt to the Com-
munist bloc. The latest was an intimation
from the Soviet that it would regard any
Egyptian co-operation with the Atlantic
Powers as “an unfriendly act.”
The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936
was made, as the Egyptian Premier
admits, “under the menace of the Axis
Powers surrounding Egypt”—that is, the
late Mussolini’s offensive in the Red Sea
against Abyssinia. “The defeat of the
Axis and the formation of the United
Nations, however,” adds Nahas Pasha,
“put an end to all menace.” The
Egyptian Army’s part during that
menace, when British Empire forces
saved the country from conquest by the
said Axis, was to patrol the Suez Canal
and locate bombs dropped by German
aeroplanes so that British bomb-disposal
squads could deal with them. Having
made a treaty to allow Britain to save
their skins, the Egyptians, when the war
was over, repented it and invoked a
clause providing that the instrument
(which is valid till 1956) might be re-
vised by agreement at any time after 10
years (1946) from the date of signature.
Thereupon the treaty was revised to
the extent that Britain agreed to transfer
the garrison maintained at Cairo to the
Canal zone, which was done as soon as
new barrack-quarters were ready. This
removal, made as part of the business of
“playing the game” towards Egypt, was
tainted in the view of the extremists of
that country by the British departure
from India and Burma and the difficul-
ties of the British Raj against Com-
munist guerillas in Malaya. “Now that
the British no longer have India,” was
one insolent official comment in Cairo,
“they can no longer possess any legiti-
mate interest in the Suez Canal.”
The Sudan demand has been made less
prominent, but abandonment of the one
is linked inextricably with abandonment
of the other ; and if the Sudanese people,
steadily educated towards self-govern-
ment for years past, should be left now
to an Egyptian overlord, then, apart from
the war which would break out on the
upper Nile, the British might as well give
up all their trusteeship in Africa and
their sponsorship of African self-govern-
ment from the west coast to the east.
The Egyptian attempt to force this
development on a British Government
which Lord Vansittart has described as
presenting “a patient posterior” to any-
one desiring to kick it is undoubtedly
part of a wider conspiracy. The Persian
development is another part of it. In
November last year King Farouk’s speech
at the opening of Parliament announced
that his Government was
proceeding without hesitation or undue
delay with the task of realising national
objectives. Foremost among measures to
be taken will be the proclamation of the
termination of the 1936 treaty in view of
its incompatibility with the United
Nations Charter and of the change of
circumstances in which it was concluded,
with the further proclamation of the two
agreements concluded on January 16 and
July 10, 1899, establishing a dual govern-
ment in the Sudan.
The announcement added the Egyptian
Government’s “hopes that the British
Government will realise the benefits to
the cause of democracy and of world
peace that will accrue from the satisfying
of these just claims.”
The concluding “double-talk” is quite
in the Moscow style. The late Ernest
Bevin, Foreign Secretary in Whitehall,
replied curtly that the treaty provided for
review with the consent of both parties,
and that Britain did not intend to leave
the Middle East defenceless. As for the
Sudan, he said, the Sudanese will in due
course freely decide their own future.
Promptly thereafter, in early December
last year, the Sudanese Legislative Coun-
cil, by resolution, petitioned the Gover-
nor-General to approach the con-
dominium Powers, Britain and Egypt,
with a request for an order granting the
Sudan self-government by the end of
1951, The Egyptian official comment on
this Sudan reaction was that “it would
not affect Egypt’s attitude, which does
not refuse self-government to the Sudan
but wishes it to be based on unity with
Egypt under the Crown of King Farouk.”
This, said the Cairo “democrats,” was
“the only regime which would conform
with Egypt’s dignity and nature’s unity.”
Russian interest in weakening the right
flank of the Atlantic Powers’ defence
against the aggressive Soviet battle-line
(across Europe is a natural deduction
from current events. What is not so
apparent is the organisation of violence
within the Arab League initially against
Israel, but also against any pro-British
influences such as that of the late King
Abdullah of Jordan, assassinated last
July by an agent of the ex-Mufti of
Jerusalem —hater of Britain, active
worker for Hitler during the late war,
organiser of Arab guerillas in Palestine
during the British Mandate, and now a
refugee in Cairo from British justice.
Headed by Egypt, the Arab League
States —Jordan opposing and Irak
hesitating—have formed a “security
association” for which they desire
recognition by U.N.0., even while
Egypt defies every U.N.O. injunction
for peace with Israel. This associ-
ation claimed at a recent congress
to be capable of defending the Middle
East against all-comers —a Middle East
in which Britain is regarded as an inter-
loper, Israel as an enemy to be wiped
out and the Jordan Arab State a traitor
to the anti-British cause.
It is high time the Western Powers
jointly asserted their own interests, as
part of the Atlantic Pact, in the
strengthening of the Middle East against
Communist intrusion from Russia and
took steps to make such assertion good.
"Labor's" Boycott Policy.
It is well that the country should
understand the policy of the “Labor”
Opposition in the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment because, if it is persisted in, it will
complete the destruction of Parliamentary
government which it has already begun.
It is not merely a phantasmagoric
phenomenon, as Mr. Calwell describes
the Fadden Budget. It is, if the outline
of policy given by Mr. Calwell himself
—its deputy-leader —is accurate, some-
thing far worse: a sort of political
phagedena, a spreading political ulcer
which must turn the whole fabric of our
political system gangrenous unless it is
cured.
Mr. Calwell, so silent for most of the
recent referendum campaign, except when
his tongue was loosened in the natural
oratorical home of himself and the Com-
munists —the Sydney Domain —has been
quite frank about the intention of the
Opposition. And Dr. Evatt by infer-
ence in discussing another matter has
shown clearly what the outcome of their
joint intentions must be.
In a speech on the Supply Bill on
October 18, 1950, which he began by
saying “I am suggesting that the Gov-
ernment should go back to the country
and obtain a mandate for the proposals
it has submitted to Parliament,” Mr.
Calwell placed on record his views
(“Hansard,” October 18, 1950, p. 985);
The president of the Australian Labor
party, Mr. Ferguson, M.L.C., has said
there will be no co-operation with this
Government. Before the Government can
hope to gain our co-operation it must in-
troduce a referendum proposal to write
permanently into the Constitution a pro-
vision for price-control. In addition, there
will have to be a revision for profits-
control, and in addition to that there will
have to be a provision to give the workers
some effective control in the industries in
which they work. When the Government
has done that, it will be entitled to go to
the workers and ask them, “Are you pro-
pared to freeze your wages for a certain
period in order that the Government may
overcome its difficulties?” But even if it
should take all these steps the workers of
Australia will say, “We do not trust you.
The only Government we will trust is a
Labor Government, and until a Labor
Government is elected you can solve your
problems alone.”
These are not mere words any more than
Mr. CalwelTs frequent assurance that
Communism can be defeated only by the
wiping-out of the capitalist system and
the introduction of Socialism under which
“we will pluck the fowl” ; in other terms,
that Russian Socialism must win unless
Mr. Calwell and his followers are them-
selves permitted to introduce Calwell
Socialism.
His elucidation of policy in his speech
on Supply is merely an elaboration of
this. It is the policy followed by “Labor”
in 1940-41, when it succeeded, in alliance
with the Communists, in destroying the
Menzies and Fadden Governments.
It means, and can mean, nothing else,
that unless the Government is prepared
to abdicate and hand over to “Labor,”
the trade-union movement and its helot
A.L.P. Federal Executive will not co-
operate with the Government of the
country in any shape or form. They will
not co-operate, though at two elections
within 18 months the country gave the
Government an overwhelming mandate,
and though at the recent referendum on
Communism the thin and scarcely visible
majority of “Labor,” obtained by the
most questionable means, was offset by
the fact that 68 electorates for which
members have votes in Parliament sup-
ported the Government proposals against
53 which placed themselves behind Dr.
Evatt.
The party should now be asked to
state openly whether it abides by Mr.
Calwell’s exposition of its policy towards
the Government. If it does there is no
room for “Labor” in the future of Aus-
tralian politics. It will have become a
mad - dog organisation even more
dangerous in a way than the Communists,
because the Communists have a limited
influence with the people at large, but
“Labor” commands a power of sabotage
which reaches into every corner of the
continent and of industry.
If its policy is that it will boycott any
Government but a “Labor” Government
it is as well that the electorate should be
asked to express its opinion precisely on
its attitude at the next elections.
Nothing could be more alarming than
the Calwell outlook at the present
juncture because it is obvious from what
has taken place on the Budget already
that irrespective of principle or belief
“Labor” proposes to boycott the Gov-
ernment and, inter alia, defence, a ques-
tion which was generally above party poli-
tics before the Curtin party came into
power in 1941.
So far the “Labor” party and its india-
rubber leaders, who at a moment’s notice
squeeze themselves and their policy into
any shape that suits their purpose, have
shown that no past expression of view-
point means anything to them if it hinders
their plans to destroy the Government
which has thrice in two years proved
that it has the confidence of a large
majority of the electorates.
It is only four years since Dr. Evatt
was screaming at the criminal wickedness
of the Communist party, which dared to
threaten to boycott the rocket range. He
at that time, in a pamphlet which
he wrote, adopted a resolution of
the A.L.P. Federal Executive that
the propaganda of the Communist
party was “for the sole purpose
of defeating the Australian defence
policy in die interest of a foreign
Power.” He described as “a very ugly
incident” the putting-forward of a pro-
posal that the rocket range should be
boycotted. He quoted with violent dis-
approval the secretary of the Communist
party of South Australia as saying that
“Australia must not become an
imperialist armed camp,” and that “if
Australia’s policy was one of peace, of
friendship with all peaceful nations, of
loyalty to the United Nations Charter,
we would have disarmament, lower taxes,
higher living standards.” He interpreted
this as meaning that the Communists were
pursuing an “international objective.”
He declared the Communist viewpoint
that “Australia, in conjunction with
Britain and the United States, was
pursuing a policy of aggression against
Russia” to be nonsense, and that
interference with the rocket range,
designed by the Communists for
“its complete destruction” through
“boycott or threat of boycott,” could “not
be permitted by the democratically-elected
Labor Government.”
But now that the democratically-elected
Government happens not to be a “Labor”
Government he and his followers are
expressing in general very much the same
views as the Communists of 1947. He
himself has said that the Menzies Gov-
ernment is a “warmonger” Government.
He advocates the same panaceas as the
Communist party —“lower taxes and
higher living standards” in conjunction
with a lesser defence effort. He is not
prepared to support the vital defence
projects which the Government, which has
the responsibility for national security,
thinks vital. And he is not now heard
shouting, as in 1947, that “the Australian
Government has a supreme duty to main-
tain vital defences of Australia” against
the Communists ; that it “cannot and will
not tolerate attempts to obstruct
carefully-planned measures found neces-
sary for the defence of Australia.”
His party, in fact, is at one with the
Communist party in its willingness to
boycott and sabotage any plan, defence
or otherwise, brought forward by any
Australian Government which is not a
“Labor” Government.
With it and its followers Menzies, not
Stalin, is the primary enemy, and it will
go along with anybody who has the
common objective of destroying the
existing Government. And this even
to the point of advocating, as it
has done in recent months, the right
of the Communists to engage in what
Dr. Evatt himself called in his pamphlet
“advocacy directed towards the seditious
purpose of sabotaging defence undertak-
ings accepted as part of the defence
policy of Australia,” in the interests of
a foreign Power, so long as they can
manage to evade the existing laws of
the Commonwealth, which at present are
hopelessly limited in the field of treason,
and, thanks to “Labor,” so easy to evade.
This is an intolerable position. It repre-
sents a policy of boycott as wicked in
its potentialities as any ever put forward
by the Communist party.
An Unloved Suspect.
“Like a shag on a rock” is a local idiom
for being left high and dry, and not a
bad one, for the shag, when not hull-
down on some billabong, is usually
sighted alone and aloof perched on rock
or log. Shags are the least attractive of
birds. Their habits are dirty, nobody
would eat them, they have no beauty,
and their gorging habits seriously denude
the rivers of fish. Now, if Sir Macfarlane
Burnet, director of the Walter and Eliza
Hall Institute in Melbourne, is right,
they’re more than ever likely to be shot
on sight.
Talking about the rabbit disease
myxomatosis and the human disease
encephalitis, he said that the latter had
become epidemic in the mid-Murray
district and suggested that perhaps
25 p.c. of the people there had been
infected, but without ill-effects.
Encephalitis, once known as ‘ X
disease,” is a kind of sleepy-sickness in
which the patient goes into a coma which
can end fatally. It now seems that a
“sort of partnership” exists between the
disease and cormorants. Sir Macfarlane
said shag-rookeries were being examined
on the theory that the birds had the
disease, which survived through the
winter, emerged in the nestlings in spring,
whence one kind of mosquito picked it
up, transferred it to another kind or
mosquito, which transmitted it to humans
and horses.
Except for parrots, there are probably
more cormorants along the Murray than
any other kind of bird. There are also
probably more mosquitoes to the acre
there than anywhere else in Australia at
certain seasons. Add these to the
Murray’s long, sleepy summer, and, it
the theory is correct, the set-up is enough
to worry every hatter from Tooleybuc to
Blanchetown. , ,
Nobody has ever loved the shag. He
now stands a very good chance of having
a price put on his head, a fate suffered
by crows, wedgetails, starlings and
sparrows for comparatively minor
offences. That is, unless Chief Secretap
Clive Evatt intervenes in his favor. He
has an affinity with shags on rocks.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Russia at War.
One thing is clear from recent events —
the new China of Mao has become
virtually a Russian province, its policies
and actions lined to those of Moscow.
Most of the recent propaganda of
overseas Communism —and there are
huge loads of it —is coming now from
Peking, which has become the Pacific
headquarters of the Moscow bloc. It is
printed in pamphlets and leaflets which
emanate from a Foreign Languages Press
in Peking in a couple of dozen tongues.
The format of the documents, the paper
in them, their type and particularly
their peculiar argot, are identical with
those of the documents which used
to emanate from Moscow. They
are all aimed directly to the pur-
pose of separating the United States from
its fighting Allies and to capitalising
every humiliation of the British Com-
monwealth in Asia. The name of the
concern which publishes them is the same
as that in Moscow —Foreign Languages
Press.
The change has been accompanied by
alterations in the fighting-line in Korea.
There is no doubt that Russia has
been conducting the war there. Even
from the first, as every veteran officer of
the Australian Royals knows, there was
a Russian adviser with each Korean
battalion and a core of Russian-trained,
if not Russian, troops in the North
Korean Army, which ostensibly came
into existence as a spontaneous volunteer
force conjured out of the peaceful
countryside when the aggressive South
Koreans attempted to carry out an attack
on the innocent Tiger districts of the
country last year.
The Chinese coming in at the end of
the year kept up for months the pre-
tence that their nationals were merely
volunteers rushing to throw out the
invading barbarian who was on his way
through North Korean territory to attack
the Chinese fatherland —for which the
average Chinese does not, in any case,
care a rap.
Later the Chinese propaganda organs,
while maintaining the volunteer myth,
published numerous pictures of Chinese
war factories at work producing muni-
tions for the “volunteers.” Now all pre-
tence about Chinese official participation
seems to have gone. And on the face of
the developments on the Korean front
all pretence that Russia is not directly
involved is likely soon to go also.
The Chinese forces have assumed the
major role so far that the North Korean
Army is almost completely in the back-
ground. Great developments have taken
place in Mao’s army, in its leadership and
its armament. Instead of the rabble
hordes which poured down the roadways
early in the year in the same way that
they poured down from the north to
Peking and Shanghai, there is now a
large, compact Europeanised army, fol-
lowing in strategy and tactics the con-
cepts of the Frunze Military Academy
in Moscow. The aircraft which supports
them is Russian, the artillery is Russian-
type if not Russian, the small-arms are
Russian, the rocket technique of the front
line is Russian, and the Chinese are now
equipped with modern communication
facilities which they could not possibly
have developed on the scale on which
they are needed in the time available
since their occupation of China.
It is becoming clearer every day that
the Korean war is World War 111 in its
first stages. It is no longer a Korean
war. It is a Russian-generated war
fought on the enemy side with Chinese
satellite troops. Russia will keep out of
it officially as long as possible, since by
so doing it is possible for the Kremlin
to maintain its spy centres and fifth-
columns in the U.N.O. countries whose
troops are being sacrificed on Korean
soil.
Review of Working Hours.
Within two years of the Arbitration
Court’s reduction of the working week
from 44 hours to 40 —which was in
September, 1947 —certain unions lodged
a claim for a further reduction to 30
hours and certain metal-trade employers
responded with a claim for 48 hours.
These moves were by way of filing of
causes by each side when next the court
should place working hours in its list
for hearing. Last year the Metal Trades
Employers’ Association filed a claim on
behalf of the whole industry for a rever-
sion to a week of 44 hours. Rising costs
in industry have made urgent a review
of conditions over the four years since
the 40-hours hearing, and the Chief Judge
recognised a “dispute” last week when
he ordered all claims on hours of work
to be listed for the sittings commencing
on October 29.
The time is certainly due for a general
examination by the court of the effect of
the shortened working week on the whole
economic structure of the Common-
wealth, which must be an outcome of
the new hearing prompted by rival
claims, No doubt, as in the extensive
sittings during 1947, Commonwealth and
State Governments, as the largest indi-
vidual employers in the land, will be
represented.
Apparently the A.C.T.U. is shaping up
to much the same position which its
representatives tried to take at the open-
ing of the 40-hour hearing. It was neces-
sary then for the Chief Judge to inter-
vene and require the A.C.T.U. to give
assurances on behalf of all unions that
it would accept the court’s finding. Fol-
lowing the announcement of last week
A.C.T.U. president Monk stated publicly
that if the employers should pursue their
claim it would lead to industrial turmoil.
The trade-union movement, he said,
“will defend the 40-hour week in
the court, or outside it if neces-
sary.” Defence of the A.C.T.U.’s
case inside the court is right and
proper; but the implied threat that
the court must find only to the satisfac-
tion of the unions is not one to be
tolerated for either the maintenance of
the court’s authority or the welfare of the
country. Does Mr. Monk think the
unions’ case now is so ill-founded?
Mr. Ward and Dr. Burton.
In the light of the fact that Australian
troops have been engaged in a bitter
front-line battle in Korea during the
week, and that Australia’s forces in that
area are to be increased by another
battalion, which means that we shall
shortly have about 7000 men in the battle-
line and its attendant bases in Japan,
the openly-expressed views of two
prominent members of the Federal
“Labor” party are of considerable signifi-
cance.
Mr. E. J. Ward is still, as in 1939,
unwilling that Australia should be
defended except on Australian soil.
Until Australian homes are ravaged,
Australian civilians killed by invaders,
Mr. Ward will do nothing to hinder
the enemy. But let them arrive in
their battalions and divisions and then he
will begin to prepare. Any Government
which feels that the enemy should be
beaten in some spot outside this con-
tinent before he lands here is a “war-
monger” Government.
This is not only Mr. Ward’s line but
the Communist party’s line. The manner
in which he and Comrade Stalin agree on
the matter of Australian defence in each
turn and twist of event and peril is about
the most striking illustration of great
minds thinking alike known to human
history. And in Mr. Ward’s latest speech
last week his common front with Com-
munist thought and statement was more
marked even than usual, for he revived
the old Brisbane-line lie.
The curious thing about this furphy is
that it was printed recently, in the detail
recited by Mr. Ward, by the Communist
party’s official organ, the “Tribune,”
which gave the date (September, 1942)
when this startling proceeding was
ordered by the supposedly cowardly
Liberals —who were not in office after
Japan attacked in any case. It is strange
that both Mr. Ward and the “Tribune”
should have had a monopoly of the yarn
and that both should have forgotten that
it was Mr. Ward’s Government which
was “responsible.”
On the morning before Mr. Ward
made his speech another hero of the
“Labor”-unity movement, Dr. Burton,
wrote a letter to the “Canberra Times”
dealing with events in Egypt, Persia and
elsewhere in Asia.
Dr. Burton was pitchforked into the
secretaryship of the External Affairs De-
partment by Dr. Evatt over the heads
of the whole civil service, and abandoned
the High Commissionership in Ceylon
last April to contest Lowe seat for the
A.L.P. He made it clear that it was “un-
fortunate” that a “Labor” Government (in
Britain) should stand against the nation-
alisation of the oil industry in Persia—
a remarkable distortion of the facts
coming from a man who has no excuse
for not being familiar with the truth. He
said that the position in Egypt was
similar, and that “there is no case for the
presence of British troops on Egyptian
soil, especially in these days of growing
independence.” No case, of course,
except that based on a specific, binding
agreement that the troops should be there
to protect, among other things, Egypt,
which is utterly unable to protect itself.
Mr. Burton says that “to stand on rights
in a document is to attach too much
importance to face” —an agreement
evidently is nothing to Dr. Burton, even
when such agreement is made under
recognised international law.
He further holds that changed circum-
stances have made “meaningless” the
“cliche that the Middle East is our life-
line.” He holds that because India,
Pakistan, Indonesia and Ceylon do not
“get excited” about the assertion of inde-
pendence by Middle East countries and
do not feel their security threatened we
should follow their viewpoint, since we
“should pursue common policies” with
them and, “logically acting as an Asian
country along with others, should follow
a neutrality policy with respect to any
Middle East and European situation,”
even in the event of world war; this
especially seeing that “we have no signi-
ficant contribution to make in forces or
supplies in our present condition.” This,
of course, is in accord with the views of
Mr. Ward and the Communist party.
Capable of “no significant contribu-
tion”! If the Spirit World does not find
Dr. Burton distasteful as a host he should
be haunted by the wraiths of all the
dead of Gallipoli, Fromelles, Pozieres,
Passchendaele, Bufiecourt, Villers-
Bretonneux, Mont St. Quentin and El
Alamein.
Fun and Games in Victoria.
With the football finals and Melbourne
Royal Show over, and a pause between
those climaxes and the forthcoming “Two
Cups” racing splurge, Victorians have
suddenly discovered a diverting perform-
ance they hadn’t noticed before. The
main stage is the Parliament House in
Spring-street, with occasional shifts to
the Trades Hall in Carlton.
The unholy alliance between the
Country and “Labor” parties was based
to some extent on Premier McDonald’s
promise to “Labor”-leader Cain to bring
in a Greater Melbourne Bill, which
Hollway’s Liberals announced they’d fight
to the death.
The other week, hearing that some
Liberal M.L.Cs. were too ill to attend the
Upper House, McDonald rushed the bill
through the Lower House and then to
the Upper House. But two of the sick
got there under their own steam, a third
was brought, “weak and shaky,” from
Geelong, and the bill was beaten by 17
to 16.
Then the fun began. The Liberals
demanded an election, the A.L.P. de-
manded a referendum to abolish the
Upper House, the A.W.U. demanded an
end to the unholy alliance, McDonald
withdrew the Greater Melbourne Bill and
the controversial Public Entertainments
Bill, and McDonald’s own Country party
was silent.
Came a notable figure on the turgid
scene. Variously described as a “cham-
pion of small nations,” “Australia’s No.
1 Communist defender,” the “hero of the
referendum” and Leader of the Federal
Opposition, he arrived full of benevolence,
and it was announced that “Labor” would
probably hold a special conference at
which he would say whether or not the
unholy alliance should be continued.
First tips were that Dr. Evatt would
advise an early election because the “No”
win had convinced him that he is about
“to lead Labor back to office”:
Since the referendum he is understood to
have urged that Labor should try to force
a Federal poll before Christmas... .tactics
would be to take a leading part in the
Victorian campaign. If successful, he would
enter a Federal poll with greatly-increased
prestige.
This early optimism seems to have
suffered a decline. Dr. Evatt semed to
think that Premier McDonald, with his
“almost daily attacks on the Federal
Government,” was “Labor’s best secret
weapon” in Victoria and ought to be
preserved in office. The weekend arrived
with Dr. Evatt telling Cain to keep Mc-
Donald in power. And Cain is after four
more Melbourne seats when the Mc-
Donald Government fulfils its promise to
increase the Parliament from 65 to 69
seats.
Noises Without.
North Sydney’s Mr. Geraghty, who as
a young boy probably used to derive
great pleasure from shouting “Boo! ”
and then running away quivering with
joyous laughter at his own temerity, last
week announced his intention of moving
for the abolition of the N. S. Wales
Legislative Council. It will be a week or
so before he is called upon to translate
his threat into action, so perhaps by then
he will have derived enough amusement
or other satisfaction from the jest and
will allow others to join him in a hearty
laugh. If not, some very entertaining
gymnastics should be seen.
There was a time when such a motion
would have been received by “Labor”
with real enthusiasm. It is the sort of
thing which might have earned an
“unendorsed” member such as Honest
Jim readmission to the party. On paper
there is no reason why it should not do
so still —especially on paper of the type
on which the platform of the N. S. Wales
Labor party is written, for that platform
provides for the abolition of the Legis-
lative Council.
Traditionally, “Labor” has always
been opposed to Upper Houses, profes-
sing to regard them as pillars of reaction.
The party’s epithets for Legislative
Councillors have covered a wide range
of picturesque phrases ranging from
“capitalist stooges” to the comment of a
one-time Premier of South Australia
John Verran —“They’re a lot of perambu-
lating corpses.” But in New South Wales
all that is changed, despite the fact that
the Council is not elected by universal
suffrage, but by the vote of Parliamen-
tarians—the two Houses voting as one.
Under this system, heartily condemned
by “Labor” at its introduction, the party
now has a majority of seven in the
Council —which means that the Legis-
lative Council is now a very good thing.
It is a particularly good thing for those
who are in it, and of “Labors” repre-
sentatives a high proportion are trade-
union secretaries and members of the
A.L.P. executive. In the days when
“Labor” was in a minority Councillors,
in theory at any rate, worked for love.
Now they collect £3OO a year “expenses,”
not to mention a free pass on trains,
trams and buses, a postage- and
stationery-allowance, use of Parlia-
mentary dining-room, library and other
facilities. Among “other facilities,”
probably the most-prized is the Parlia-
mentary bar—not the “bar of the House”
to which persons are sometimes
summoned, but the bar from which they
are summoned when the division bells
ring. Finally, there is the prestige attach-
ing to the job and the right to use the
tag “honorable” —not that good “Labor”
men worry themselves about prestige or
titles!
Among “Labor’s” representatives in the
Upper House is the Honorable J. A.
Ferguson, who is also president of both
the State and Federal A.L.P., in which
capacity he has the privilege of telling
Premier McGirr and Opposition-Leader
Evatt what to do, including, on one

to dump Jim Geraghty. It would be

Premier in the matter of Geraghty’s
abolition motion. Perhaps it would be
more interesting still to hear what he has
to say to Geraghty.
Silt Makes Mud.
“Abdul Assiz”: For many years past
the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce has
been agitating for improved cargo-
handling equipment and more efficient
dredging, but not much mud was stirred
up by its efforts until, to save themselves
from extinction, the Newcastle wharfies
joined in the fray (B. 22/8/’5l).
In the last month for which statistics
are available, 18 ore-carrying vessels have
had to lighten ship to 21ft. draft at
Port Kembla in order to negotiate the
restricted and tortuous channels of the
port of Newcastle. This Kembla diver-
sion costs not less than £5OO per ship, and
the cost is of necessity passed on to
industry and to the public.
Silting at Newcastle also threatens to
isolate Stockton on the northern arm of
the harbor; the Newcastle-Stockton
vehicular ferry is frequently stopped, this
necessitating a detour of 30 miles for
all wheeled traffic.
An official report made to the Federal
Government by the Administrative
Officer of the Ministry of Shipping (Mr.
L. T. Kelly) states that the condition and
equipment of the King’s and Lee wharves
“reflects little credit on the responsible
authority and is the result of years
of neglect.”
The report attributes siltation to the
same cause, and says that it “is a serious
threat to the peace-time economy and a
positive danger to the future war effort
of the Commonwealth.” It is also pointed
out that most of the dredging-plant is old
and subject to frequent breakdowns ; that
the four tugs in Newcastle range in age
from 56 to 32 years; and that there is
no valid reason why such an important
port as Newcastle should not have a
unified system of control.
Public Works Minister Cahill’s answer
was that this grossly exaggerated the
position. The secretary of the Newcastle
Wharflaborers’ Union (M. H. Weaver),
already perturbed by the fact that his
union had lost nearly 400 members,
representing half its strength, during the
past six months, affirmed that the Kelly
report was a plain statement of fact, and

he challenged Mr. Cahill to visit New-
castle personally and then see if he could
deny the charges made.
Mr. Cahill now states that Newcastle
harbor will be in a normal condition for
navigation in a few months, (The Dutch
dredging tender becomes operative in
February next year.) That will depend
on what Mr. Cahill defines as “normal";
but a similar expression of opinion was
made, over a year ago, when the principal
engineer for Harbors and Rivers, N.S.W.,
estimated that “with present equipment
and the addition of the Richard Vowell,
at the end of about four months, vessels
of the Iron Yampi class and coal ships
should be able to come and leave here
fully loaded if the harbormaster keeps
them to the deep berths.”
A cynic, writing in the New-
castle Press, points that the southern
breakwater took 100 years to build,
and that that feat has, ever since,
set the tempo for the port authorities.
Another contributor suggests that
Newcastle harbor be allowed to silt
up completely, and then be converted
into a car-park by pouring on to it a
veneer of concrete. The maritime needs
of Newcastle would be served by Port
Stephens, which, after all, offers a com-
paratively silt-free harbor!
POLITICAL POINTS
This almost looks like provocation.
McGrrrrr’s new tram-fares are to take
effect on November 5, the anniversary of
Guy Fawkes’s attempt to blow up the
Houses of Parliament.
Strange how the doctrine of self-
determination nearly always seems to be
a one-way affair. Nehru, arch-advocate
of India’s right to decide her own destiny,
has other ideas on the rights of Hydera-
bad and Kashmir ; Indonesia’s new rulers
had no sooner become free from Dutch
control than they forced the Celebes and
other islands which were to have had
self-governing status to accept domina-
tion from Jakarta. Latest example is
Egypt; Nahas Pasha is determined that
British troops must leave the Canal zone,
and equally determined to put Egyptian
troops into the> Sudan.
Embarrassed as the Attlee Government
undoubtedly is t>y events in Persia and
Egypt, nothing is surer than that the
party’s propagandists will turn them to
good advantage after the election. As
soon as the numbers go up and the
Attlees go out the cry will be raised that
their defeat was not a rejection of Social-
ism but a result of mass hysteria created
by Tory and Press a* tacks on Middle
East policy.
In this country Doc. Evatt has got in
early with that specious line of “reason-
ing/’ His story is that anti-British demon-
strations in Persia and Egypt are staged
in order to bring discredit on the Labor
Government during the general election
campaign because they fear its United
Nations policy “of preventing exploita-
tion by improved living standards.” If
the Doc. means that these troubles would
not have occurred if Churchill had been
in power his conclusions are possibly
right, even if the arguments by which he
arrives at them aren’t.
Eddie Ward, after congratulating the
British people for having had as their
leader in the last few years “a man of
stability and foresight—Mr. Attlee —
rather than warmonger Churchill,” had a
few words to say on Persia:
If it is right for the British Government
to nationalise the steel industry, what is
wrong with Persia nationalising the oil
industry?
The British people will shortly have an-
other chance to choose between Attlee
and Churchill, and to say whether it is
right to nationalise steel. In the mean-
time even Ward should know that the
Persian oil industry is the product of
British brains and British capital exclu-
sively. The oil in the ground may be
Persia’s, but Moussadek and his clique
have done no more towards mining and
refining it than did Xerxes. Then there
is the matter of a signed agreement which
the Persian Government has repudiated.
Finally, when Attlee grabbed the steel
industry he had enough stability and
foresight to exempt the big steelworks
owned by Ford Motors, a non-British
concern.
Much play has been made by the Oppo-
sition on the iniquity of “taxing the
kiddies’ ice-creams,” and it was about time
someone pointed out, as one or two Gov-
ernment members did, that ice-cream is
not devoured exclusively by children.
There’s no way of finding out the exact
percentage that goes down adult gullets,
but researchers who make a study of the
clientele of city milk-bars won’t find a
very high proportion of youngsters in
them.
If higher prices are to mean less ice-
cream for kiddies, why doesn’t the same
argument apply to their daddies’ beer?
Although schooners and middies are up
steeply in price, Sydney bars are still
crowded and barmaids are still raking in
the customary heaps of treys and coppers
left on the counter.
Final figures for the Red referendum
show how narrow Evatt’s famous victory
really was. With the States three for
and three against, the Noes had a majority
of 52,082 in a poll of over four and three-
quarter million. On a percentage basis
the score was Yes, 49.44; No, 50.56.

Melbourne “Age” notes that “Misery”
Martin, who as secretary of the Lord’s
Day Observance Society for 26 years has
opposed Sunday entertainments, is to
retire and be succeeded by “Woeful”
Wilmot. Both gentlemen are rather proud
of their nicknames; Martin claims his
has been worth “thousands of pounds to
the society.” Any attempt to persuade
the A.L.P. that “Muddler” McGirr and
“Egregious” Evatt would be of the same
value would be futile —the A.L.P. has no
sense of humor.
In the height of a flurry in Victorian
Parliament during an attack on Premier
McDonald by Opposition-leader Holl-
way, “Laboj”-leader Cain interjected.
Hollway’s deputy, Oldham, then shouted
“Can’t you ever let the Premier speak
for himself?” In the view of both the
Country party and “Labor,” that would
never do.
Wheatgrowers, committed to the Inter-
national Wheat Agreement by Federal
“Labor” when it was the Government,
are now finding that reduced crops mean
less wheat for the “free” market under
the I.W.A. terms. They were warned
again and again that this situation was
bound to arise under Pollard “stabilisa-
tion,” nevertheless they voted for it. It’s
hardly fair to blame Menzies for it, as
they’re now doing.
A Mr. Galvin, one of the bright stars
in the Cain “Labor” party, wants a “little
shrine” erected to the man who is a
punter, a drinker and a smoker because
he is “carrying the country on his back.”
That’s probably the best epitome that
could be found of “Labor’s” outlook.
Under a ruling by Speaker Cameron
“Dorothy-Dix questions” are now out —
if the Speaker can detect them in time.
Urging N. S. Wales Cabinet to end the
price-freeze imposed last July, Prices
Minister Finnan argued that uniformity
among the States was essential for effec-
tive price- and marketing-control. Cabinet
apparently agreed with him, because only
McGrrrrr and Evatt minor opposed the
thaw. Uniformity didn’t worry Cabinet
when it decreed the freeze, and as regards
butter-prices it is N, S. Wales, along with
Queensland, which refuses to adopt the
uniform price agreed to by the other four
States. Finnan and his colleagues have
discovered that goods are being diverted
to other States where prices are not
frozen. Ordinary commonsense citizens
told them three months ago that this
would be the effect of their freeze, but
ordinary commonsense doesn’t appeal to
the McGmrrs.
G.-G. McKell seems to have a yen for
studying nuts in their native habitat. A
few years ago he visited Brazil; now he’s
gone to Barcelona.
S’Artie’s habit of collecting next year’s
dues this year seems to be spreading;
Victoria’s State Electricity Commission
has caught the complaint and proposes to
ask country customers to contribute half
the cost of extending electricity facilities
to their districts. Money thus advanced
will be a loan, but will not bear interest;
consumers’ electricity-bills for the first
five years will be debited against the
advance and any balance then remaining
will be refunded. It is claimed that the
scheme will enable the commission to go
ahead with planned extensions which
Loan Council cuts had threatened with
postponement. At least such a plan
would lay the emphasis on self-help, and
that is a rare thing among Government
instrumentalities.
Among provisions in a new Road
Traffic Act in South Australia is one
doubling the registration-fees on diesel-
powered trucks over petrol-driven trucks
of the same weight-power rating. The
extra money is for road maintenance and
the impost is fair enough, since diesel
jobs don’t pay a penny in petrol tax.
McGrrrrr got £4B million from taxa-
tion reimbursement this year (it was £l4
million ten years ago), plus £2.5 million
extra from the Federal roads fund, and
loan money for Governmental, semi-
Governmental and local - authority
borrowing runs into nearly £lOO million.
No N.S.W. Government in history has
ever had so much money to spend. Yet
to hear McGrrrrr squealing anyone
would think he had the bottom out of his
pants.
Laurence Short, who for years has
been waging an uphill fight against the
Red bosses of the Sydney Ironworkers’
Federation, is entitled to give himself a
couple of pats on the back over recent
developments. His successful application
to have this year’s election of the union’s
officers conducted by secret ballot under
Commonwealth supervision was a nasty
blow to the Comrades, and when the
present executive sent out telegrams sum-
moning members to a special meeting to
discuss its election campaign Short applied
to the court for an injunction preventing
the use of union funds for such a purpose.
The Full Arbitration Court granted the
injunction, with costs against the branch
president, secretary and trustees.
Voting for a new Legislative Councillor
to fill a casual vacancy in the N. S. Wales
Uppah Chambah resulted in the “Labor”
nominee, C, W. Anderson, being elected.
Anderson is a member of the Australian
Broadcasting Commission, for which he is
paid £3OO a year, and the Libs are talking
of challenging his election on the grounds
that no-one holding an office of profit
under the Crown is eligible for a seat
in the Council.
Not for the first time, Eddie Ward has
been flourishing in the House a confi-
dential document which has somehow got
into his hands. A few months ago the
East Sydney pet boasted that he was kept
well informed of what went on inside the
departments he formerly controlled. He
didn’t seem to realise that by that remark
he was reflecting on the integrity of his
former officers, but if what he said is true
it is fair enough to reflect that if he had
kept himself equally well informed when
he was actually in charge of the depart-
ments he might have saved himself con-
siderable embarrassment.
Queensland Full Court unanimously
dismissed the appeal of H. Grant, of
Gympie, against the election of Thomas
Dunstan as State “Labor” member for
Nash. Dunstan won by 25 votes. The
Elections Tribunal held that 48 electors
were wrongly left off the Nash roll by
official error, and Grant claimed that
their being excluded made the election
void. The Full Court held that there
was no duty on the electoral officer to
include 28 of the 48 on the first Nash
roll, and omission of the other 20 couldn’t
have affected the result
There have been yelps that, whereas
Prime Minister Holland of N.Z. is cutting
income tax, Menzies is increasing it.
Figures trotted out by Earle Page tell the
full story, which shows that the increased
Menzies rates will still be lower than the
decreased Holland scale:

it says nothing of the amounts previously

“D.A.”: They’d been married a
month: she determined to become a
good cook in three lessons, he convinced
that gardening really held few mysteries for
a purposeful mind. The potato scarcity
in Sydney prompted her to buy some
sweet potatoes the same day as he bought
some dahlia-bulbs at 6s. each; both
brown-paper bags went into the same
cupboard. Confident of her culinary
ability, she invited some friends to dinner
next night, and it really was a nice meal,
except that hubbie decided he didn’t like
sweet potatoes. The friends, of course,
said everything was simply marvellous.
Wife herself wasn’t happy about the
sweet potatoes, and did some investiga-
tion later; but she hasn’t told him yet
that his 6s. dahlia-bulbs which he thinks
he planted the following Saturday will
come up eventually looking mighty like
sweet-potato vines.

“Binjang”: We have hitherto regarded
the porpoise as useful only because its
hide provides us with boot-laces; but at
our local flickery a film was shown the
other night of one that has been trained
in Florida to tow joyriders about on
water-skis. It slides alongside a pontoon
to be harnessed with the docility or resig-
nation of a circus-pony. The idea surely
has possibilities.
Think of the saving
in petrol and up-
keep if a fisherman
had a pet porpoise
to tow him to and
from the fishing-
grounds. Some way
would have to be
found of prevent-
ing the creature
from sounding
whenever it felt in
the mood ; perhaps
this could be
effected by attach-
ing inflated bladders to it. Another little
problem that might arise would be how
to curb or curtail the cetacean’s fondness
for fish. : A muzzle of some sort that
could be adjusted in the vicinity of the
fishing-grounds, would, provided, of
course the R.S.P.C.A. had no objection,
be one solution to it. A new occupation
—that of catching, training and selling
porpoises for towing purposes to piscators,
yachtsmen and promoters of aquatic
sports—might conceivably prove lucrative.

“Doric”: Why are “comic”-strips so

book depicting the Bible story. “Excel-
lent idea, don’t you think?” he said.
“Such a simple way of teaching the
children scripture—just like a comic-
strip!”

“Irving”: Windfalls from uncancelled
stamps (B. 26/9/’51)? The combination
of a rainstorm and the belated arrival of
a Queensland country train ended a
lucrative racket operated by a too-
resourceful Brisbane office-boy. The gaze
of a Government auditor, whilst he
awaited the belated train, strayed idly to
a pile of iron boxes in which motion-
picture films were consigned. He noticed
that a transparent layer of a plastic-like
substance was peeling off that area of the
labels occupied by the freight stamps.
He had no difficulty in peeling off the
complete layer and with it the cancella-
tion marks of the railways, leaving the
freight stamps underneath in their
pristine uncancelled and negotiable con-
dition. Under investigation the youthful
racketeer admitted to the concoction of
a transparent solution which, when
painted over the stamps, formed a pro-
tective layer of sufficient toughness to
preserve the freight stamps from the
defacing marks of the cancellation
device. It was an easy matter to soak off
the protective layer when the canisters
returned and pocket the cash his
employers advanced for the next consign-
ment.

“Villefair”: A market - gardening
friend assures me that the time to plant
lettuce on a big scale is when prime
specimens are bringing about tuppence a
dozen in the markets and the last consign-
ment has returned a debit for carrier’s
charges. His argument is based on the
theory that only the stout-hearted have
another go—and they cop a seller’s
market. I can follow that reasoning all
right, but I fear I’ll never comprehend
the complexities of selling eggs. Now
that you can buy an egg without prefac-
ing your grovelling request with an order
for about a quid’s-worth of easy-to-get
commodities, a radio-advertising cam-
paign to boost sales of poultry products
might be expected. But no! The voice
of the egg-lauder is strangely still. A
month ago, when you couldn’t buy a
goog unless the shop-assistant was trying
to make a hit with your daughter, a radio
blitz repeatedly extolled the nutritious
values of an egg diet. And to round the
thing off with a final touch of incongruity
the harangue always finished off with —
not a hen cackling, but a rooster
crowing.

“P. Servant”: I am now within the
category of the threatened 10,000 and feel
no sense of disloyalty. Four years ago,
in the general office of the Government
Department which pays my salary, the
shutter - blind broke and was duly
reported. Two years ago, carpenter and
assistant arrived, examined the damaged
shutter, took some measurements and
departed. Six months ago the serenity
of a morning-tea break was interrupted
by the arrival of a new shutter. Without
further ado the old shutter was removed
and the new one hinged up, only to
reveal a discrepancy of 3in. in their
widths. The office has now received a
formal circular requesting whether there
is a window which will fit the new shutter.
Last week, with the arrival of a seemingly
vengeful spring, I removed the piece of
cardboard which has been covering a
pane of glass broken at the same time
as the shutter, and which, apparently,
was disregarded by the carpenter because
it had not been formally reported.

“A.L.D.”: That 18th-century French-
man who believed there were men with
tails living in Australia was not com-
pletely fantastic (B. 5/9/’5l). Rudi-
mentary tails have been found on some
Australian aborigines. In a book Hubert
Wilkins wrote about the collecting tour
he made in Australia in the 1920’s for the
British Museum there is a photograph,
taken in Arnheim Land, showing one of
a group of natives with such a tail.

“Geehem”: It is correct that the Uni-
versal Postal Union prescribes three
“musts” for postage-stamps, but the colors
green, red and blue do not represent basic
rates on “second-class” mail, inland letters
and foreign letters (B. 26/9/’5l). They
indicate a letter, a postcard and a news-
paper respectively, addressed to a foreign
country. The new stamps conforming to
U.P.U. regulations will thus be 7id-
(blue), (red) and 3d. (green). The
fact that local letter-rate has been repre-
sented by a red stamp in past years has
no postal significance beyond that of co-
incidence with the rate applicable to
foreign postcards. The two rates have
now drawn apart (3yd. and 4yd.) so that
the local “red” goes overboard without
the necessity for a referendum.

“Doynest”: One after another, Mum
and I and the kids went down with the
’flu ; she and I were pretty right after a
couple of days, but the youngsters took
longer to recover, and the eldest lad made
little response to sulpha-
diazine and other wonder
drugs. The bright young
pair of doctors who usually
attend us —they work in
regular shifts these days—
found that even by doing
overtime they couldn’t get
around to all the ’flu
victims, so they sought the
aid of a retired medico.
He followed their prescrip-
tions at first, but when the
lad’s complaint defied all the
Government free lifesaving
medicines he shook his head
sadly, followed my wife into
the sitting-room, and re-
marked in a confidential
whisper: “What’s your
opinion of all these sulpha,
things?” She was tactfully
noncommittal, so he gave
her a new prescription.
So far as we could
gather it was mainly old-fashioned
aspirin. Whatever it was, it did the trick ;
in a day or two the youngster was on
his feet again, lively as a cricket. Maybe
some of the older remedies shouldn’t be
jettisoned yet.

“Wingella”: The Northern Territory
abo. is getting civilised, and is accordingly
becoming subject to the white man’s
diseases, including appendicitis, a com-
plaint which did not trouble the black
until recently. A blackboy at Katherine
and a lubra at Darwin both developed
the complaint, were operated on within
a day or two of each other, and both
made good recoveries. Darwin doctors
say this is the first time appendicitis has
been known among the abos in the top
end of the Territory, though an A.I.M.
sister at Alice Springs recalls assisting at
an appendectomy on a native at Un-
doolya station about 20 years ago.

“Curate’s Egg”: A rough measure of
“Public Honesty” (B. 19/9/’5l) is the
decline in the amount of “conscience
money” received by Government depart-
ments. Some years ago the regular
arrival of postal-notes of varying values,
always enclosed in envelopes addressed in
the same obviously disguised hand, kept
one State Government agency wondering
for a long time. Came the day when a
very high-up was convicted for lodging
fraudulent claims for travelling expenses.
Some months later it occurred to a bright
brasshat that, in all the journeyings in-
volving the fake claims, the convicted one
had been accompanied by an assistant,
who had also been paid expenses. The
junior was then charged, but produced a
list of postal-note numbers, each repre-
senting an amount obtained by lodgment
of a fraudulent voucher. He claimed that
all moneys had been refunded as “con-
science money.” As the list was supported
by the record in the official postal cash-
book, and the junior claimed that he had
lodged the fake claims in awe of his dis-
honest boss, he escaped with a disrating.

Jasby”: The first time my wife found
a number chalked on the front gate she
rubbed it off and thought no more of it
until it appeared again a couple of days
later. Then she blamed the children, who
indignantly denied responsibility. She
washed it off again ; it reappeared after
a few days. For three or four weeks the
battle continued ; then the unknown scribe
gave up the struggle. Flushed, with vic-
tory, the spouse sought other fights, and
when the milkman called for his money
she tackled him about consistently short-
delivering milk. He was at once apolo-

the job every few days. And you don’t
make it any easier.” Asked what he

“Waddlin’ Willie”; Marconi’s historic
wireless signals which first bridged the
Atlantic half a century ago are being pre-
served in Britain’s science museum at
South Kensington. They are on a short
strip of paper tape, and were handed over
to the museum board a couple of weeks
ago by Mr. P. J. Woodward, who was
Marconi’s personal receiving engineer in
the very early days of radio. The historic
incidents of December 12, 1901, have
been written before, but they are worth
repeating again, for they tell the story
of courage and determination by a bunch
of keen scientists who evolved a theory
and spent much energy and time making
it a reality. After preliminary experi-
ments had shown wireless waves could
travel across the Atlantic, Marconi, then
in Newfoundland, received the first faint
signals, the single letter “S” from the
transmitting-station at Poldhu, Cornwall.
By the following winter a powerful trans-
mitter had been installed at Glace Bay,
Cape Breton Island, and on the night of
November 28, 1902, Mr. Woodward
heard faint signals at Poldhu, using the
then new magnetic detector and a tele-
phone head-piece. He was so thrilled
he was tempted to try to record them by
a less sensitive morse tape-recorder. He
did. Mr. Woodward kept the strip for
almost half a century, then decided it
would be better in the museum, of which
it is now one of the most prized posses-
sions.

writer the mechanic gave a loud snort
and snigger. “This is an old-fashioned
machine,” he exclaimed, looking at me
with mingled amusement and pity.
“You’ll never be able to sell it.” I told
him I had no wish to sell it. I merely
wanted him to put it in order so that I
could use it. He gazed about him.
“George Washington and Abraham Lin-
coln!” he observed in not-admiring tones,
noticing two out-of-date persons whose
portraits had no commercial value. He
next told me which articles of furniture
I would not be able to sell because they
were priceless, and which I would not be
able to dispose of profitably because they
were worthless. Then, as he passed
through the hall on his way out, he
stopped before a picture of Rheims
cathedral. Another snort and snigger!
It seemed he was thinking of the absurd
waste of time and labor involved in the
intricate and elaborate carving of the
stonework which ornamented the edifice.
“Do you consider modern cathedrals more
beautiful?” I asked. “Oh, no,” he
answered, “but they’re built for speed.
Everything’s done for speed nowadays.”
He stopped again at the front-door to
examine its stained-glass panels, and re-
marked “They don’t make these things
now. Take too long. Think of the time
this would take to do. It’s quicker to
cut a pane of amber or pink glass and
shove it in. All this leadlight work has
gone out, except for churches.” And he
hustled off, with legs and arms whirling
like a piece of modern machinery designed
as a symbol of the value of time and
the Age of Speed.

“W.P.T.”: On a radio session a com-
petitor stated that he was stationery-
control officer in a Government depart-
ment, but he could not tell the announcer
the name of the department because it
was “on the security-list.” Now the
listeners are left wondering which de-
partment handles the atomic-bomb
stationery.

“D.J.G.”: Not that I believe in tele-
pathy, but I was hammering out a story
on the typewriter and found it necessary
to mention the existence of a bridge some-
where in north-east Tasmania. Any
bridge in that area would have served my
purpose ; the exact location did not matter.
I recollected there was a deep river
running past a township in the district in
which the story was set, and I decided
it was reasonable to assume there would
be a bridge there. In went the bridge
and on I went with my story. Next day
I read that the previous night, at almost
the precise time I was typing that par-
ticular part of my yarn, a car had gone
over the bridge at the town I had in mind
—a small place, virtually unknown out-
side the Speck—and several deaths had
resulted. I still don’t believe in telepathy,
but , . .

“First Aider”: If there had been a big
casualty-list in the Serviceton rail smash,
the Victorian Railways would have used
its mobile hospital for the first time. The
body of the ambulance was built on the
chassis of a lease-lend Ford. One wall
lifts from the outside in three flaps, form-
ing a roof. Inside are three cupboards
containing dressings, drugs, antiseptics
and complete emergency medical kits, in-
“ Anyhow , I proved I could start her by pushing her into the wind.”
eluding amputation-saws, artery-forceps,
probes and scalpels. The third cupboard
holds basins, sterile towels, soap, a three-
gallon container of boiling water and
various vessels. All bottles are numbered,
instruments fit into clips and no item is
concealed behind any other. Inside the
ambulance there are six portable cabinets
containing first-aid requirements which
can be carried direct to casualties ; a dozen
“ Careful , woman—you pricked me again!”
stretchers, large numbers of splints, spine
boards, blankets, towels, supplies of band-
ages, extra dressings; and compartments
for hot water and tea. Over the whole
ambulance a canopy can be erected, en-
closing it within its own tent. Lighting
comes from six reflector lamps, as well as
from lights built into the van. A large
number of portable hand lights are also
carried. At the scene of an accident the
ambulance can operate with a team of
trained ambulance-men administering
first-aid, and doctors giving treatment to
casualties. The mobile hospital has re-
mained in its garage at Spencer-street
station since 1943. The railways hope, of
course, that it will never have to be used,
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: Ancients who
dodder about the reasons for their
longevity may assert that beer-drinking is
the secret, or that total abstinence has
brought them long life; that they are
voracious salt-eaters or never take salt;
but the queerest explanation for his piled-
up years that has come my way was
given to me by a nonagenarian who says
that he never eats a proper meal until he
is really hungry. I have heard the one-
meal-a-day theory before—Stedman, who
built up a big sweet business, was one
of its protagonists, but he died a com-
parative juvenile before he was 7a Still
this old-timer says he has gone tor over
three days without a meal except occa-
sional cups of tea and coffee and accom-
panying biscuits or toast. When he de-
cides to eat, the meal is gargantuan,
When restaurant meals were rationed, he
says, he would go to three restaurants
in succession before he was satisfied ; then
he went home to have a long sleep and
let digestion do its work. That, of course,
is the way of life of carnivorous animals
in their wild state; but they seldom live
long. Man’s ancestors had similar habits,
but longevity was certainly rare among
them. Nobody has told us when the
three-meals-a-day institution began; it
seems an opening for researchers.

“Bill Ding”: Nothing indicates the
changes in the timber-industry of
Westralia more than the disappearance
from the landscape of the huge stacks
of boards and joinery timber that once
attracted the attention of every tourist.
Assembly- and trucking-yards existed
where hundreds of men broke down the
stacks and loaded up trucks for town
depots or for Bunbury and Fremantle.
One big sawmiller alone could boast at
one period of carrying stocks of 12,000,000
super-feet of drying timber. Today he
probably hasn’t a twentieth of that —
and most of his stacks are fresh timber.
In the old days when sawmills could cut
as they liked the big stacks just had to
rise and stay there till thoroughly dried
out; today it is a case of hand-to-mouth.

“Bo”; The workings of the flapper-
mind are indeed wonderful and
mysterious. It was very obvious that the
two gum-chewers were making their first
visit to the races and that they were
about to make their very first bet. There
was much whispering and giggling before
they finally decided which steed was to
transport them to Easy-street. Eventu-
ally they stood uncertainly before a
bookie and his penciller. There followed
another protracted session of giggling
and consultation as to the next procedure.
Then one of them glanced up at the
legend which disclosed that the holder of
the magic bag was one Schumacher;
registering puzzlement, she took her com-
panion by the arm and said: “Come on,
Shirl, let’s go to another one —we’d never
be able to pronounce that name!”

“Boglet”: Tassie’s No. 2 city always
has a floating population of tourists, and
the locals can easily pick these sightseers
by the cameras round their necks and the
look on their faces—but not until they
speak can they tell the mainlanders from
touring Taswegians, How? Not by the
accent, but by the mainlander’s universal
pronunciation Lcwnceston. You tell them
it’s Lo/rceston and they say it’s spelt
Lawnceston They’d probably laugh at a
Pommy who said it was “spelt”
Awstralia!

“Billy See”: For trade economy I’ll
back the Greek in the fish-shop round
the corner. From the head of “de
schnapp’,” he pares every scrap of flesh
Then, taking two long rib bones, he
spears them crossways through the largest
piece, and deftly threads on every other
fragment. Dipped in thick batter and
fried —“well, what you want —de fried
schnapp’ piece? Nine pen’.”

“E.P.”: The London elephant (B.
3/10/’5l) too old to learn new circus
tricks at 20 must be one more horrible
instance of the debilitating effect of the
Welfare State. Across the Atlantic, in
the last stronghold of private enterprise.
One-eyed Jenny, the oldest elephant in the
Ringling circus, is still working at 77,
though it is usual, even there, to retire
before the age of 70. Big Ruth, Ring-
ling’s lead elephant and star performer,
can, and will, do any trick any other circus
elephant can do bar carrying a tiger on
her back. Probably because no one had
thought to tell her that “the greatest age
an elephant attains to is round about 40”
" and that it “ceases to think at 20,” Big
Ruth, at 49, established leadership in
a herd of 72 circus elephants, and last
year, at 61, learnt to grumble deep in her
throat when asked if she wants to eat,
and to play the opening bars of “The Star
Spangled Banner” on the harmonica.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Billy T.”: It was a most enjoyable
w'edding ; plenty of the bright young folk
of whom the central couple were typical,
but, as they represented old families in
the district, enough grey-haired guests for
a good gossip and a dip into the past.
The bride really did look charming, and
it was easy enough for the toast-proposers
to say she looked lovely, and that they
hoped the future would not dim her
radiance, and that young Bert was a lucky
man to have landed such a beauty, and
—you know how it goes. But over in a
corner old John Madden looked thought-
ful. “I hope they’ll hit it off,” he mused
as I settled beside him, “but she’s terribly
pretty.” A thoughtful pause, then, “Y’
know,
Billy, when
I was a
bit of a lad
an old
feller says
to me,
‘John,
when
you’re
thinkin’ o’
g e t t i n’
m a r r i ed,
don't go
for the
pretty ones. Get the ugliest girl you can
lay your hands on, because she’ll never
leave you.’ ” His voice dropped, “An’,
my Gawd, I proved him right!” Just
then Mum Madden bounced through the
door, spotted us, and yelled, “Ain't she
lovely? They deserve to be ’appy—’appy
as we are.” She fetched her lord a thump
between the shoulder-blades (upon her
approach he had put his glass on the
floor for safety), and with a parting shout
of “Forty years an’ never an angry word! ”
she departed to get a couple more under
her belt. Barney McGee’s shoulders
shook gently: “Never an angry word!”
he chuckled. “Dammit all, she ’ung ’im
three times, but the kids always cut 'im
down!”
* « * *
“B. A. Ker”: Sitting in a picture-show,
I was reminded of a pony we used to
have when I was a kid. She was a willing
little mare to drive, but harnessing her
was like trying to tie a horsehair around
a piece of quicksilver. You couldn’t
approach her head without upsetting her ;
yet she had absolutely no vice in her
make-up! It just seemed that she became
a bundle of nerves whenever a human
came close enough to touch her. We
had grown to accept the peculiarity as
just one of those equine individualities
when Dad’s old cobber came on a visit.
Within a few minutes he had discovered
the cause of the trouble —and proved
the solution. The mare had not been
used to being approached on the near
side; “Stand on the offside and you can
do anything with her,” said the voice of
experience, and added: “Must Ve been
broken-in by a blackfeller.” I was never
sure whether the addendum was a joke
or not, but in the film last Saturday night
the youngster was supposed to have “a
way with horses,” yet he repeatedly
approached, caressed and groomed a
draught mare from the offside. (Inci-
dentally, he used the currycomb on her,
although a stallion occupied the next
stall. I was always taught that to curry-
comb a mare under those circumstances
was to start a love-affair that nobody
could stop.) Now I’m trying to determine
whether Hollywood directors don’t know
"Well, I gave you a good run for your money."
which is the near-side of a horse, or
whether our pony was broken-in by a
Yank.
* * * *
“Wakka”: The beautiful wild azaleas
of North Queensland, with creamy petals
and red stamens, mentioned in Rachel
Henning’s letters (B. 26/9/’5l), are the
wild rosellas of my childhood. We used
to eat and enjoy the leaves of the shrub
which grew on the stony ridges near our
Queensland home. Leichhardt mentions
them in his journal. They are an inland
hibiscus ; the flowers are exactly the same
shape as the common hibiscus with which
the Papuans decorate their woolly mops.
The fire-tree mentioned is probably the
bottlebrush.
* * *
“Mat’s Mate”: Most of that Sunday
we’d been away along the river fishing,
and when we got back to the tent about
four in the afternoon we saw a bike
leaning against a side-rail. About 100
yards from the tent Mat stopped and
said slowly, “Ain’t that a woman’s
grid?” It was. About then we also
noticed that a rope was stretched between
two saplings behind the tent, and from it
depended three or four items of feminine
apparel. We considered this phenomenon
and then we considered each other, and
Mat said “What the blazes is goin’ on?”
“Only one way to find out,” I said. We
advanced upon the tent, keeping a look-
out in all directions. There was nobody
in sight. We eyed the bike and the cloth-
ing, speculating aloud. Then Mat opened
the tent-flap. Inside, wrapped closely in
a blanket, was a young woman. Com-
pletely self-possessed, she informed us
she’d fallen in the river, seen the tent,
guessed we’d be away some time,
stripped and hung her clothes to dry and
would we see if they were dry. They
were. She collected them, disappeared
into the tent, reappeared clothed nor-
mally, said she was sorry for having to
borrow the tent, then mounted her bike
and rode away. Mat watched her go,
thoughtfully kicked the fire together, and
said “Soon’s we cut out this job we’ll
make f’r Bogan Gate. The bloomin’
wimmen round here take too much for
granted.”
* ♦ * •
“Abdul”: For 20 minutes the young
cove had been down in the yards trying
vainly to put his bridle on the blood filly
which had been relegated to him as
mount. Each time he cornered her she
turned backside on to him, stood almost
on her head and lashed out with her
hind pins. A pair of slick feet and a
growing sense of caution had kept the
young bloke out of trouble, and he was
patiently but slowly bringing the filly
round to a less-spirited resistance when
Sulky Jack walked into the yards. Tak-
ing the bridle from the youngster with an
“I’ll catch her for you, young feller,” he
sidled up to the wayward lass, bridle
trailing from his left hand. Suddenly the
flighty one slewed round and brought up
from the ground a pair of slashing upper-
cuts. “You blankard! ” roared Sulky, and
brought the bridle down hard on the
filly’s rump. With a squeal and a flurry
of hooves the filly was off at full gallop,
tail flying and eyes rolling. She was still
careering around excitedly when the
young cove, with the prospect of another
exasperating and patience-trying 20
minutes, sighed wearily and moved in to
commence again. Jack, noting this,
mounted his old moke and remarked to
Charlie: “Well, I done what I could for
him and he still ain’t no nearer to catchin’
that filly than he was when he started.
Young fellers today ain’t got no idea bow
to handle horses.”
* * * «
“Tiersman”: A 25-year-old caged
galah owned by Mrs. John Gardner, of
Belair (S.A.), has just laid its second egg
—its first was laid 24 years ago when
she was owned by Mrs. Gardner’s
parents. For a week or two prior to
the latest effort she spent most of her
time fussing about the floor of her cage,
dragging a drinking-jar into a nest-like
position and lying alongside it, although
declining to use straw and grass just as
handy to her. Currently she sits on the
egg at nights and spends the day moving
about or perching. This must be close
to a record for between-layings.
* * * *
“Heresone”: Occasionally an up-to-
date pair of magpies will turn out a steel-
framed modern home, but
most of their kind stick to
the old-fashioned materials.
Similarly willie-wag likes a
bit of horsehair in his nest,
starlings find roofs an ideal
location at times, and for
many smaller birds the
rubbish-heap and fowlyard
are the answer to the
building-material shortage;
but all these will quite cheer-
fully build as their fore-
fathers did when man and his
ways are not handy. Still, I
often wonder how the
swallows managed prior to
1788. I have once, and once
only, seen a cluster of the
bottlenests of the latter in a
sandstone cave; yet almost
every sizeable bridge sup-
ports plenty of them. Never
have 1 seen the welcome
swallow's mud-cup anywhere
but in a man-made structure
—houses, out-buildings, tanks
and even wells being favored.
Yet the tree-martin and
white-backed swallow have
never changed their ways;
one still selects a small knot-
hole in a tree-trunk, while
the other drives its tunnel into a steep
face of earth, as do many other quite
unrelated species.
♦ * * *
“Ringwood”: Having ploughed many
furrows, straight and otherwise, on river-
banks from the Goulbura, in Victoria, to
the Calliope (Q.), I still don’t know why
the local, or surface, fall is always away
from the river-shore. Water from con-
fributory streams is compelled to
go far deeper as it approaches the
river. It would thus seem that a great
portion of the alluvial soil eroded by
rivers never reaches the sea at all, but is
pushed out to right and left by the foam-
ing torrent of water in its onward rush
to the sea. Net result is that all rivers of
my acquaintance are now running on, or
through, comparatively high ground,
though, of course, they must originally
have started business on the ground floor.
* * * *
“Shamuseen”: The attraction of a
turtle carapace for the remora, or sucker-
fish (B. 19/9/’5l), was the basis of Torres
Strait Binghi’s traditional method of fish-
ing for the shellback. A captured sucker-
fish was fitted with a kind of tiny head-
stall attached to a long line and then
dropped overboard. When the gyrating
line came to a rest the hunter knew that
his submarine pointer had attached him-
self to the quarry by means of the fleshy
suction-disk set in the sucker’s crown.
It was then an easy matter for the hunter
to go down along to the line and put a
half-hitch around several hundredweight
of prime turtle-steak.
* * * *
“Shadow-chaser”; The butt log of the
green ironbark from which we were
splitting posts had been damaged either
by fire or another falling tree years before,
and the protecting sap had grown over
the wound and covered it with some 6in.
of new growth. But there was still a
flaw between the new growth and the
old. The length was solid top and bottom
and the opening was microscopic. Only
when split open was the “flaw” revealed.
It was then we noticed the frog inside
the aperture. Apparently it had entered
and wakened up after hibernating to find
itself a long-term prisoner. It had only
a few inches of living room, and a few
more years of tree-growth would have
deprived it of even that space. As the
log fell apart, exposing the prisoner to
air and light, he inflated his gaunt frame,
raised himself on his tip-toes, and died
without a croak. What he existed on
through all those years puzzles me.
* * * *
“Vet”; “You know,” began Herb re-
flectively, “when 1 took up that bush-
bloek o’ mine, I no sooner started to trap
it than a mob o’ crows and a couple of
eagles battened on t’ me. Followed
round me traps every day they did, the
crows eating the carcasses, and the eagles
pinching the rabbits out of me traps.
When I finished trapping and began
clearing, it was half a dozen jackasses
that took up with me. Followed around
all day, grabbing everything they could
to eat. The jackies faded out when I
started ploughing, but the magpies came
in dozens. Each one after all he could get.
After that, a couple of cockatoos spotted
me sowing seed, and they sent word to
every other cockie within a hundred
miles or so, and those scavengers got
quite a lot of seed. Still, it was a fair
crop, considerin’. Had to sell a bit
early because the mice pinched too
much. Then, soon as I got the cheque,”
sighed Herb, “the shire blokes wanted a
whack to keep some roads in order
somewhere else, the land-tax office
“Stop reading the menu from right to left,
George !”
wanted some, I don’t know what for,
and the Federal fellers demanded a share
to keep a lot more blokes in comfort
Gripes, talk about followers!” Herb
paused and shook his head resignedly.
“Oh, well, they’ve each got their pickin s,
he concluded, “and I’ve just cashed tbs
bit that’s left, and I’ve got it here now
in me pocket.” Gleefully we all fol-
lowed Herb into the bar.

“Old-timer”: I see by the papers that
“swarms of mosquitoes are so thick they
are impeding traffic on Murray River
roads” around Mildura. I used to think
the Mildura mossies were pretty bad until
the time me and Happy Jack camped a
thousand wethers on the T.S.R. out of
Balranald and then went to bunk. We’d
hardly hit the nap when we heard the
Balranald brass-band playing. As we
listened it marched out of the town down
to our camp and turned out to be mossies
gathering to the feast. We beat ’em by
wrapping ourselves in the blankets from
head to toe and breathing through our
pipes stuck out of the blankets. Next
morning we breakfasted early and got
the sheep moving, and about the first
thing we noticed was that our three dogs
had laryngitis. They couldn’t bark, not
even Lady, the red bitch who on the
command of “Speak up!” usually pro-
duced a peal like a bloodhound and set
the jumbucks galloping. However, as the
sheep moved listlessly, with no breaking
or baulking, it didn’t matter —until three
wethers folded up in front of Jack and
he bent to pick one up and came up hold-
ing a fleece with some bones hanging in
it. We gaped at it and at each other,
and then we turned slowly and looked at
our silent dogs. Yes, the flaming mossies
had not only sucked everything out of
the sheep except the bones and fleece ;
they’d even drawn the bark out of the
dogs.

“Bo”; The snake had been reported
seen around the house for several days,
but it was evasive. Then one mid-morn-
ing a shriek from Mum brought Dad
galloping from the woodshed into the
kitchen. Mum had bent down to get
some wood from the wood-box beside
the stove and Joe had slithered from be-
side it into the hall. Dad got down the
shotgun and moved into the passage
warily. The snake wasn’t in sight. He
moved into the open sitting-room just in
time to see it going through the rat-hole
by the radio. Dad let go with one barrel
and scored a bull —right through the
loudspeaker. It was Mum who, follow-
ing up with a kettle of boiling water,
fixed the nether end of Joe. Judging by
the cunning look on Dad’s face as he
hung the gun up again and said “Well,
that’s one pest less to annoy a man,” it’s
extremely doubtful if he was referring to
Eve’s tempter.

“Waterloo-street”: There are two
distinct types of kookas: the big fellow
known as the swamp-jackass, who may
chuckle at, or after, a good joke or meal
but never laughs outright, and the com-
mon-or-garden variety whose laughter
breaks the bush silence at dawn and
dusk, and, if the occasion justifies
hilarity, in between. The swamp-jackass
is unmistakably kingfisher in appearance
and habits, better-looking than the
humorist, is never found far from water-
courses or lagoons and is distinguished
by a brilliant emerald shield-shaped patch
on his wings and a dash of the same
color on his crown. Despite his gay
appearance he is a lonesome, rather
“Go easy on the big tum-tu m—I can't hear myself."
morose character with only one mate (as
far as I know), who is not nearly so well
dressed and groomed as he. Like all
kookas, they nest in a hollow limb, and
rarely hatch more than one chick,
although the hen usually lays three eggs.
The common comedian found every-
where in bush or suburb is an unashamed
bigamist, who will brazenly flaunt his
“fairy” even in the same hollow limb as
his lawful missus. I have never intruded
close enough to ascertain if the real and
the de facto hatch on separate nests, but
the offspring of both have the same early
ambitions: to eat and be merry.

Will Lawson: H. A. Lindsay’s
comment on my par. re Polynesians call-
ing at North Queensland and naming it
Ulimaroa (B. 12/9/’5l) seemed to prove
that I was wrong. I knew I was right,
so wrote to a New Zealand authority on
Maori affairs —A. H. Messenger, old-time
whaler, explorer, writer and artist. This
is what he replied:
That Maori voyagers touched on Queensland
coasts is one of the old traditions, preserved
and related to me by old Heta Turoto, tohunga
of Ngatimaru tribe on North Taranaki coast.
His story tells of the high, dark land named
Ulimaroa, which a canoe reached through a
break in a great reef. The crew on landing
were attacked by tall men armed with long
throwing-spears and a strange weapon which
the Maoris named the “flying mere”—the
boomerang. This struck men from behind,
and was something new to the Maoris, so they
put to sea again.
In open ocean they noted flights of small
birds heading due east. Some landed on the
canoe, and were identified as the small shining
cuckoo, which migrated each year from the
Solomons and Queensland to New Zealand.
The Maoris followed the birds, flights of which
they saw each day, and so came to the west
coast of Maoriland’s North Island. On landing
the first bird-note they heard was that of this
shining cuckoo.
Major Andrews, a North Taranaki man well
versed in Maori traditions, laughed heartily at
H. A. Lindsay’s claim that the sight of the
formidable stretch of surf-battered Barrier Reef
would make the boldest canoe-chief give it a
wide berth. “Can you see those intrepid Maori
navigators scared by a coral reef?” he asked.
“What about navigation of the wild coast of
Aotearoa? Our canoemen have run the huge
seas of the Manukau and Kaipara bars and
battled through the Terewhiti Rip in Cook
Strait.”
As to the Maori method of steering east or
west, north or south, that great historian Peter
Buck states that the usual course was to the
rising or setting sun, and at night by fixed
stars. Also by following migrating birds.

“H.C.8.”: For seven or eight years
old Chick has kept a crow —or raven ;
which is the white-eyed bloke? —in an
aviary. The bird is a splendid specimen,
especially when the moult leaves him a
glossy blue-black, but in spite of the
fact that he will eat out of Chick’s hand
and has a vocabulary equal to the average
domesticated galah, I’ve never been able
to take a fancy to him —and I’m fond of
birds. Spot, the foxy, apparently shared
my prejudices; hurling canine abuse
through the wire has long been a favorite
pastime with him. Alas, one day last
week he made the mistake of charging
up to the wire when his aversion was
feeding on the ground. He is not likely
to do it again. A Kelly is always a
Kelly, and an empty socket is a grisly
reminder that, from a crow's point of
view, there is nothing so succulent as an
eye—whether its owner was a lamb or a
fox-terrier.

“Nailil”: Contrary to popular belief,
mosquitoes prefer the original Australians
to whites as menu-pieces, though their
playing greater havoc with the hides of
the latter gives rise to the fallacy. At
the height of plagues during nor’-west
monsoonal calms in Torres Straits I’ve
been able to bear with much fortitude
their onslaughts while remaining on a
lugger anchored just offshore, whilst the
entire crew of a Binghi-manned cutter
has been forced to up-anchor and move
about half a mile out, preferring an
uneasy night’s tossing in a swell to a
sheltered but beplagued sojourn off a lee
shore.
“Solitude”; We’d dropped off at the
pub, drunk our pockets empty, and were
turning to leave when we heard a car
stop outside. At the door I was in time
to see someone disappear into the other
entrance, leading one of those fluffy
Pomeranian things on a leash. “What’s
that, Sol?” Seventyfiver, a pace behind,
had barely glimpsed the animal. “Dog.”
“Dog! D’
you say
dog ? Aw,
y’ mad,”
he sniffed.
“Must ’a’
been a
cat.” We
leaned
against a
v e r a nda-
post, and
were rounding up a couple of smokes
when from a side door came the figure
in slacks and shirt, still leading the imita-
tation canine. At the edge of the veranda
they paused, then made for the car across
the road. “There y’ are, Sol,” said the
old bloke triumphantly. “Cat.” “Dog,”
I reiterated. With a match in his hand
he paused. “You dinkum?” he queried,
squinting sideways. “Y’ mean y’ really
think that’s a dog with that bloke?”
“That’s not a bloke,” I told him. “That’s
a sheila.” He glanced at me, shrugged
and returned to his pipe-lighting. It was
drawing nicely when next there emerged
from the pub a white-skinned individual
in blue shorts, blue-spotted top, and a
blue beret affair. Seventyfiver watched
idly. “That girl must belong t’ the car
with the bloke an’ the cat,” he remarked
presently. “Yair, only it’s not a girl.
That’s a bloke.” He glanced at the color-
ful figure and turned to eye me more
critically, “Awright, c’mon, we better
make tracks, Sol,” he decided. “You’ve
’ad enough.”
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: The reported “occu-
pation” of Browse Island by a party of
Indonesians will take old pearlers back
to the time, just after War I, when a
couple of Dutch schooners were arrested
at Scott Reef, a couple of hundred miles
west of Browse Island, and brought to
Broome. They were trepanging —as I
suppose these latest invaders were —and
were charged with poaching in Australian
territory. Scott Reef consists of three
main shoals, and, according to Admiralty
charts, the northern and southern shoals
are “almost dry” with “several dry rocks,”
The Dutch said the reef wasn’t Australian
territory ; the Commonwealth said it was.
The court finally ruled that it wasn’t any-
body’s—in fact, it wasn’t territory at all.
As it was awash at high tide it couldn’t
be classed as land and so couldn’t come
under the sovereignty of any country.
The Dutchmen were acquitted.
* * * *
“Picker”: We pulled up at the Twenty
Mile gate and had a yarn with a drover
in charge of a Territory mob. As we
drove away I said to Old Harry, who
hasn’t forgotten anything for the last
70 years, “D’ you know that bloke?”
and he replied “Never seen him before
in my life, but he used to work for a
butcher about forty years ago.” Asked
how he had come by that knowledge, he
explained: “Well, I noticed that his right
stirrup was a hole or so higher than the
left one. When you start off as a lad
humping a big basket of meat delivering
for a butcher, you always shorten the
right stirrup-leather to rest the basket on
a level thigh, and you’ll never ride com-
fortable for the rest of your life with
both stirrups at the same level.”
DOWN THE SHAFT.
Pick, pick, pick,
Neither slow nor quick,
Muffled is the sound
Way down underground
Where the earth is night,
By the feeble light
In the candle’s glow
Forty feet below.
Pick, pick, pick,
(Drooping candle wick);
Working on his knees,
Cramped and out of ease,
Lying on his side
Where the strata ride.
Breezes never blow
Forty feet below.
Pick, pick, pick,
Where the air is thick.
Silent is the talk
Where the pressures stalk
Through the earthy deep.
Where the mysteries creep;
Earth is ever blind,
Groping for its kind,
And the terrors grow
Forty feet below.
Pick, pick, pick,
(Little beams that flick,
Feint and fade about;
Candle going out).
A human down a hole,
Working like a mole —
Naught but earth and stone,
Solitary and lone.
Grey the funnel sides
Where no sunlight bides,
And, away up high,
The ever-watchful eye
Of the bright blue sky.

The last couple of years have been
crowded with events, many of which
promise to have an important bearing on
the future of this big variety-chain-store
organisation—oldest and largest in the
Commonwealth. In June, 1949, the
Stewart Dawson properties facing Pitt-
ed King-streets, Sydney, were bought
lor £859,000-odd, the deal being financed
mainly on mortgage. Here the intention
is to put up a modern 10-storied build-
ing as soon as Capital Control, materials
and labor permit.
In April, 1950, £465,454 of bonus-
scrip was scattered, three for ten, from
share-premiums reserve.
After protracted negotiations Selfridges
—a rival variety-chain with 16 stores in
N.S.W., a subsidiary in Westralia and
another in N.Z.—was taken over in Oct.,
1950. The price was £356,250, met by
the issue of 1,425,000 f.-p. ss. ords.
Trading results of each co. suggest that
the deal is not likely to weigh down
earning-power of the purchaser.
Then, to protect its minority interest,
Coles bought the outside ords. held in
the Westralian subsidiary (5250 f.-p. to £1
and 51,150 paid to 15s. each) for £24,056,
paying in 96,225 of its own f.-p. ss. ords.
Meanwhile, Woolworths, Ltd., bought
Coles’ interest (26,000 f.-p. £1 shares and
47,800 shares paid to 16s. each) in Sel-
fridges (N.Z.), Ltd., at an unstated figure,
which was probably around 40s. a share
on a f.-p. basis. This N.Z. offshoot was
taken over by Woolworths (N.Z.), Ltd.,
which had also swallowed McDuffs, an-
other chain organisation in the Dominion.
After that Coles issued 5,003,775 new
ss. ords. at par, one for two, to those
on its own register in Nov., 1950. The
money was wanted to finance all-round
expansion of business, including the pur-
chase of six properties in Victoria, one
at Toowoomba (Q.), one at Rockdale
(N.S.W.) and the Sydney Arcade (Sydney),
which was bought from Dymocks Book
Arcade, Ltd., for £130,000.
Finally, just before the books closed
in June last, all the 485,050 £1 shares in
F. and G. and Investment Pty. were
bought from Foy and Gibson (Mel-
bourne) for £1,176,656, and with them a
controlling interest in F. and G, Stores,
Ltd. (previously O. Gilpin, Ltd.), which
operated a chain of 91 stores in country
areas in Vic. (58), N.S.W. (28), S. Aust.
(3) and Tas. (2). Since then £54,000 has
been paid for most of the remaining ords.
held by outsiders. At June 30, 1950,
F. and G. Stores had a paid capital of
£866,430 in 100,000 7 p.c. A and 200,000
6 p.c. B prefs. and 559,400 ords., all of
£1 each, and 140,000 ords. paid to Is.
each. Profit for the year was £24,234
(down £26,043). Of the 91 stores 40
are to be sold, which will thus reduce
considerably the net purchase price, and
provide more working capital.
All this added £1,631,250 to Coles’ paid
capital, and, of course, was accompanied
by other big changes in the financial
structure:

The net addition to fixed assets was
£725,677, to shares in subsidiaries
£1,556,219, to stocks £1,620,774 and to
book debts £31,825. Mortgages were in-
creased by £488,868, the overdraft by
£865,254 and the creditor item by
£759,919. Including balances owing on
properties (£78,166), there was 15s. 9d.
of outside money in the business for
every pound belonging to shareholders
when the books closed.
The need for more share-capital is thus
plain. But Capital Issues Control last
week refused consent to the co.’s request
to make a new share-issue. The co. has
renewed its application with increased
vigor. Without additional share or other
fixed capital the rate of development will
be temporarily retarded.
The new cash-paid capital hasn’t had
an opportunity to contribute much to the
pool, nor has the management had time
to remould the policy and technique of
businesses taken over. So, although turn-
over romped along and the profit stepped
up by £433,372, the earning-power of
capital declined. The £479,692 of profit
covered the pref. div, and 14.7 p.c. on
average ord. capital as against 21, 17.6,
21.3 and 16.6 p.c. back to 1947. That
was after making an unspecified allow-
ance for taxation and setting aside
£199,114 (up £32,193) for depreciation.
The div. was lowered from 15 p.c. to
13y p.c., which was equal to approxi-
mately 15 p.c. on capital as it stood
before the bonus-share issue.
At 235. (28s. 4d. at end June) the ss.
ords. give an immediate return of 2.9 p.c.
on a 13y p.c. div. basis. The £1 8 p.c.
prefs. at 395. 6d. yield 4 p.c.

After maintaining the fleet in good order
and condition and providing something
for depreciation and taxation, there was
no change worth mentioning in last
term’s declared profit, which was only
£ll more than the modest 5 p.c. div.
called for;

Including additions of £20,000 each to
the insurance and replacement reserves,
the £156,268 of profit thus shown was
only 6.6 p.c. on capital, or a mere 4.6 p.c.
on shareholders’ funds (capital and re-
serves combined). And the chairman says
that, as in the past, ancillary interests
made a substantial contribution to profit.
The holding in subsidiaries figures at
£136,500, shares in other cos., plus an
unspecified amount of book debts, at
£911,379, and Government securities and
cash at £1,090,482 ; total £2,138,361, or
52.2 p.c. of the total assets. The co.’s
interests (nature not specified) have been
recently extended to New Guinea with
“satisfactory initial results.”
The fleet (five passenger and 21 cargo
vessels aggregating 75,623 tons gross) is
the largest on the coast. Last term the
hulk of the Quorna (606 tons) was handed
over to the R.A.A.F. for bombing practice,
and a new cargo steamer, Borda (4038
tons), built at Brisbane, came into com-
mission too late to benefit the year’s net
earnings. A sister-ship, Boroota, was
launched at Whyalla and will soon join
the rest of the fleet.
Between them the waterside workers,
the seamen and the Government have
landed Australian coastal shipping in such
a mess that the meagre profits now being
won from the trade are not a fair return
on capital involved and services rendered.
Delays, owing to lack of labor on the
wharves, shortage of crews and industrial
hold-ups, ashore and afloat, cost the co.
approximately £230,000 last term, the
chairman said. In 1939 one of the co.’s
vessels, Mulcra (1200 tons), did 13 round
trips, each of a week’s duration, between
Port Adelaide and Melbourne, and
transported 27,300 tons of cargo. The
same vessel on the same run, and for a
similar period in 1951, made only three
round trips handling 7200 tons cargo.
Finally the public pays for this per-
nicious cost-price inflation —higher freight
and handling charges express themselves
in higher retail-prices for goods. More-
over, official allowances for depreciation
are inadequate for maintenance of real
capital at today’s cost of replacement.
The danger inherent in the waterside-
workers’ and seamen’s journey to the
New Jerusalem is that of perishing in the
desert on the way.
The investment possibilities of the scrip
lie largely in the subsidiary and ancillary
interests and in what the board might
ultimately do with the big wad of Govern-
ment securities and cash:

book-value of steamers, etc., while
£208,111 was added to book debts and
investments, £42,034 to stores, etc., and
£13,640 to freeholds, etc. To meet the
outlay cash, etc., was drawn upon for
£635,954.

This old-established business, which grew
up on production of boilers, butter-
factory and dairyfarm equipment, is now
engaged wholly in the distribution and
servicing of tractors and earthmoving
equipment. It holds the N. S. Wales and
Queensland agencies for the following
U.S. organisations: Caterpillar Tractor
Co., Trackson Co, (manufacturers of
front-end loaders), Athley Products Corp.
(makers of loaders, etc.), and Deer Co.
(producers of wheeled-type tractors and
farm equipment). To help overcome the
dollar problem the American cos. set up
an associate, Steelweld Pty., Ltd., at
Footscray (Vic.), to make equipment sup-
plied by them under licence.
It was as recently as 1946 that the co.’s
American friends prevailed upon it to
vacate the dairy-products field and con-
centrate entirely upon distribution of
tractors, etc. Since then a run of good
seasons, high prices, growing recogni-
tion of the value of mechanisation in
combating farm costs, and public works
programmes have sent the demand for
tractors and earthmoving equipment along
with a rush. The next table, which shows
the number of tractors in use in N. S.
Wales and Queensland, gives some idea

The figures for 1951, not yet available,
have continued to expand.
The Deer agency, taken over when the
public became interested in the business
in mid-1949, has proved a very valuable
addition to the list. As the business grew
more capital was got in and the gains
from expanding turnover lengthened their
lead over advancing costs.
Last term shareholders were rewarded
threefold two issues of shares,
one a gift and the other for
cash, and a lift in the div. The
gift consisted of £60,000 of bonus scrip,
one for five, of which £17,000 came from
share premiums and the other £43,000
from a property-revaluation reserve
(£44,681). At the same time 120,000 new
£1 shares were issued, one for three, at
30s. each, thus lifting paid capital to
£480,000.
Sales were a record, and net earnings
were written £31,710 stronger at £156,975.
That was after allowing £19,684 (up
£1514) for depreciation and something
for taxation, which the chairman says is
expected to cover the increased rate an-
nounced in the Budget. It also disregards
an unexplained addition of £24,013 to
reserves. The £156,975 was equal to
45.5 p.c. on average capital as against
41.7 p.c. and 38.3 p.c. for the two pre-
ceding years. A 2-J p.c, bonus was added
to the 10 p.c. div., making 12% p.c. for
the year, which called for less than one-
third of declared net earnings. The
£113,850 that remained lifted reserves to
within £44,684 of paid capital.
The fresh cash-paid capital and share
premiums, plus surplus earnings and an
extra £118,356 from sundry creditors, etc.,
went mainly into stocks (up £422,574)
and book debts (up £59,735):

The growth of £76,439 in fixed assets is
due partly to the revaluation already
referred to. The growth in the more-or-
less liquid surplus (£660,302) was
£286,105.
The co is in good trim to meet the
difficulties ahead, and there is a wide
margin between earnings and distribu-
tions. So the market prices the scrip at
635. 6d. (655. a couple of months ago)
to return 3.9 p.c. on a p.c. div. basis.
Net tangible cover is 38s. 2d.

THE CURE FOR INFLATION
No industry in Australia is suffering from the
rise in prices to the same extent as gold-mining.
No recourse to Price Fixing Commissioners is
open to it. The price of gold is fixed through
the exchange relationship of the Australian £
with the American dollar through the instru-
mentality of the International Monetary Fund,
which was formed at the close of hostilities in
Europe, and of which Australia is a member.
It is important to bear in mind that the
measuring rod of every currency is its inter-
national redeemable value in gold at the basic
rate of 35 dols. per fine oz. At the time the
International Monetary Fund was formed it was
decided to restore the same relative value of the
currencies in terms of gold that existed pre-war.
In doing that we made exactly the same mistake
that was made after the First World War. The
mistake made then was not the attempt to
restore gold to its old position in the monetary
affairs of the world; the mistake was in return-
ing or trying to return at the pre-war gold price
which had no relation to existing world price
levels. These new price levels had been caused
by inflation resulting directly from war finance.
You have but to glance at the statistics to see
that the money supply of the world had vastly
increased during World War I. The increase
of monetary supply during and since World
War II has been infinitely greater—the rise in
prices has been greater, and it was greater
because inflation of the money supply was
vastly greater. These features are common to
the world.
We have got to realise that Australia is only
one country in a world suffering from inflation,
which, by the way, is a much abused word and
rarely used in its proper sense. Rise in the
prices of commodities is not the cause of
inflation-—it is the result. The basic cause of
all inflations is monetary. It is largely owing
to non-recognition of this basic fact that we
have a lot of people running round advocating
control of this and regulation of that. They
see the symptoms, and instead of attacking the
cause of the disease they try to effect a cure by
attacking the symptoms. A little laudanum in
an aching tooth will temporarily mitigate the
pain, but it is much better and much safer to
go to the dentist.
For some years now the doctrine of managed
currencies has taken deep root in the minds of
men. The I.M.F. was to be, as it were, the
king pin of the system. Its founders overlooked
that the basic theory behind the scheme could
never work so long as all the nations, members
of the fund, retained their individual sovereign-
ties. Despite the major departures that have
already taken place from the initial set-up of
the 1.M.F., the only tangible result that has
been achieved through managed currencies is
a world in which there never has before been
so much monetary confusion and uncertainty
and such widespread inflation.
I believe there is a cure. What is more, 1
think it is the only cure. It wifi arrest inflation.
It will kill its growth like a terrier shaking a
rat. It is the restoration of sound money once
again. The only sound money; money that is
interchangeable throughout the world and that
is a store of value and will not in any reason-
able period of time lose its value, is gold. That
is not to say that the old sanctions of increased
interest rates and the proper relation of bank
ratios to reserves should not be temporarily
resorted to as occasion may require, but so long
as there is no fixed base for the value of money
none of these things can exercise more than a
fugitive effect in arresting inflation, despite the
efforts of the Central Banks. Perhaps, it is as
well to say here, that in the exercise of the
powers of the Central Banks the only thing that
really matters is the overall figures of the Trading
Banks and not the individual accounts of the
Banks’ customers in regard to which the Trading
Banks are in a far better position to judge than
the Central Banks can possibly be and should
have, within the limits set for the overall figures,
complete freedom to exercise their discretion.
It is because the advocates of managed
currencies have discarded the old sanctions in
monetary affairs and have tried to substitute in
their stead exercise of human wisdom in matters
which are beyond the wit of man, that we in
Australia, in common with the rest of the world,
have reached this dangerous inflationary phase,
the cure for which is primarily sound money.
Let the leading nations of the world put back
upon their paper currencies the promise to once
more redeem their notes in gold and put an end
to redeeming paper with more paper and
inflation will cease to be the bugbear it is
to-day. I do not mean to say that prices can
be restored to pre-war levels. The war and
war finance made that impossible, but we can
stop the rot. Nor do I think, whilst returning
to gold, it is necessary to restore all the
rigidities of the old gold standard. We have
learnt something from the depression of the late
twenties and early thirties, but I do believe we
are in very great danger of having the whole
of our economies falling into ruins round our
ears if we continue on the prodigal course we
are at present following.
Prior to World War I, when the Common-
wealth Bank notes were redeemable in gold the
note issue in the hands of the public was
£4,600,000. It then ceased to be redeemable in
gold.
At the end of World War I it was £20,800,000.
At the commencement of World War II it
was £33,000,000.
In 1945 it was £170,000,000.
To-day it is £239,000,000.
All this increase is the product of the printing
press. It is fiat money. This same history has
been duplicated by pretty well every nation on
earth, and it is still going on, side by side with
an ever-increasing scale of money supply. The
figures of the money supply in Australia over
the same period, but only to the 31st May,
1951, are as follows:
June, 1914
June, 1918
June, 1939
June, 1945
May, 1951
£237,000,000
338.000.
612.000.
1.356.000.
2.516.000.
There has been no comparable rise in real
wealth. Productivity has lagged far behind. We
are getting deeper and deeper into the mire of
managed currencies. Technically it may be
difficult for an immediate return to internal
convertibility affecting the economies of the
major trading nations of the earth, but it ought
to take place now. It may be necessary to first
free the exchanges and let each country’s
currency first be adjusted to its true international
value in terms of gold. But if it is to be done,
let us not forget the lessons of the past. No
currency, be it dollar or pound or franc, is
worth more than what it will buy in commodi-
ties. It is nonsensical to talk about a rise in
the price of gold depreciating the value of
fixed debts in money. The depreciation has
taken place in the rise in prices of the things
the fixed debts, or their annual proceeds, will
purchase. To bring gold into line is a mere
act of common sense, nor, properly handled,
would it give rise to any further inflation.
There is a very grave danger that as they see
money slipping through their fingers the people
will lose all faith in the currency. I do not
contemplate the sort of runaway inflation that
from time to time has taken place in various
countries which led to complete collapse and
inevitable reconstruction, but I am satisfied we
are heading for a very great deal of avoidable
trouble.
. One outstanding tragedy of the present posi-
tion is that the existing state of affairs is making
it daily more difficult to win from the ground
the requisite quantities of the gold that will be
required to assure the liquidity of the world’s
monetary systems when the gold standard is
restored. From this point of view alone it is
incumbent upon those in charge of the world’s
monetary affairs to take the earliest possible
steps to see that each member of the I.M.F.
can restore gold convertibility to its currency
so that all currencies can, in reality and not in
theory, be measured in terms of one another
and the present unreal and dangerous position
be brought to an end.
U.S.A. with its enormous gold reserve is the
one country that could and should lead the
world back to sound money. For her to do so
at the present price of gold would inevitably
lead to a major depression in which both the
States and the world would suffer. If U.S.A.
were to raise the price of gold to some approxi-
mate parity with her internal price level, as
sooner or later I am convinced she must, and
return to convertibility of the dollar now, she
would confer a great benefit upon the world,
far in excess of those arising from her amazingly
generous international gifts during and since
the war, and no one would benefit to a greater
extent than the U.S.A. herself.
Meanwhile, is there anything that can be
done for the Australian gold-mining industry
to assist it to meet the ever rising spiral of
costs? I think there is. South Africa, which
produces some three-fourths of the world’s gold,
has shown us the way. She sells 40% of her
gold on tire free gold market, and has reaped
a very substantial reward over and above the
price fixed by the I.M.F. There is nothing to
prevent Australia doing the same —save the
Taw, which compels every owner of gold to
sell to the Commonwealth Bank all gold pro-
duced at the fixed price laid down by the
I.M.F. There is no reason whatever why the
Australian Government should not take the
same steps as the South African Government
has done and give the Australian gold producers
the same opportunity. Forty per cent, of the
South African gold production is many times
greater than the whole of the Australian output.
If our gold were sold on the free market it
would save some mines from closing down. It
would enable the mining and treatment of some
ore that now must be left behind. We are
trying to get the Government to agree to take
similar action to that taken by South Africa.
We understand that this subject is to be dis-
cussed at the forthcoming meeting of the Inter-
national Monetary Fund in a few days’ time
and it is to be hoped that the Australian rep-
resentatives will make a resolute stand with
South African, Canadian and other representa-
tives of the British Commonwealth for freedom
from the present prohibitions which are imposed
on Australia as a consequence of her member-
ship of the I.M.F.
I do not think Australia has benefited in any
way by its membership of the 1.M.F., nor, for
that matter, do I think has the world. If the
I.M.F. will not agree to Australian gold being
sold in the markets from which its gold miners
can obtain the best price, then I think the
Australian Government • should set its gold
miners free of the present restrictions and allow
them to sell their gold where they can get the
best prices. This action would at least be a
help pending those greater changes which would
free the exchanges, settle the true international
value of currencies and restore once more their
internal and external free convertibility, both of
currencies and of paper money, into gold, thus
giving back to the world the only known sound
form of honest money. That will stop inflation.
All these other nostrums, price-fixing, credit
control and so on, while they may prove a
temporary relief, can never be a cure. Mean-
while they act as a camouflage hiding from the
public conscience the root cause of all the
trouble.
If a scheme built upon the basis of sound
money were reintroduced all further false infla-
tion would be eliminated. Only justifiable fluc-
tuations in prices could occur. There would be
an end to the purchase of votes by political
promises which could only be fulfilled by what
amounts to deliberate falsification of the whole
credit system, which is to-day threatening to
destroy us altogether. The nation would once
again become honest. The workers’ wages, the
clerks’ salaries, the proceeds of farmers’
produce, the widows’ pensions, the savings of
the thrifty, insurances against accident and
death, interest on Government bonds would be
paid in honest money. The present insidious
robbery would cease and honest effort be fully
rewarded.
Queen-Adelaide-street block, are
now in a stronger position than
ever before. For this they can
partly thank fortuitous circum-
stances ; but most of the credit
has to be handed to the manage-
ment for its keen merchandising
and cautious financial policy,
which has included the brighten-
ing of the store and improve-
ment of shopping facilities, and
strengthening of the co.’s re-
sources by adoption of a moder-
ate dividend-rate and accumula-
tion of reserves.
Shortly before the close of
last accounts £35,000 of bonus
scrip was issued, assets being
written up by a like amount for
the purpose. That restored the
2s. per share lopped off the ords.
in 1934, thus raising face-value
of the scrip to £1 again. At the
same time the pref. div., which
has been lowered from 7 p.c. to
5 p.c. in 1934, was lifted to 6
p.c. Thus paid capital now
stands at £400,000 in 50,000 6
p.c. cum. prefs. and 350,000
ords. Also a contingencies re-
serve of £45,000, previously
lumped with tax provision, was
disclosed.
Turnover took an extra-
ordinary leap of £429,678 (26.6
p.c.), mostly during the last half
of the term:
1948. 1950. 1951.
„ £ £ £

Exes. . . 274,599 330,046 447,885
Net profit.. 84,293 72,428 79,588
It is plain from the figures that
the co. is trading on diminishing
gross margins, while at the same
time exes, are taking propor-
tionately deeper bites. The level
of profit therefore shows a
marked dependence on turn-
over ; hence much will depend
upon the flexibility of price-
control when turnover ceases to
go ahead fast enough, or when it
gets into reverse-gear.
The year’s profit (which bene-
fited by only £7160 of the
£124,999 growth in gross earn-
ings) covered the higher pref.
div. and 23 p.c. on average ord.
capital as against 29, 31.9 and
33.4 p.c. for the three preceding
years. The allowance for taxa-
tion was £BO,OOO (up £36,000),
which was enough to cover the
increased rate of co. tax. The
div. remained at a moderate
p.c., equal to 8.9 p.c. on capital
as it stood before the gift-scrip
issue. Of the £48,337 that re-
mained, £14,000 p.c. of the
profit) was handed to the staff
in bonuses, and the balance
lifted reserves to within £6732 of
paid capital.
During the year £186,635
(£35,000 of it on account of re-
valuation) was added to premises
and plant, £223,112 to stocks
and £19,784 to book debts;

The slip of £71,592 in the more-

Consolidated Tin Dredging
This is the big holding co.
that was recently registered in
Melbourne (nominal capital
£5,000,000) to merge the interests
of nine Australian-owned tin-
dredging concerns operating in
south-east Asia. Treasury con-
sent has been given to issue
5,505,230 10s. ordinary shares,
none of which are offered, or are
to be offered, for public sub-
scription. Those on the operat-
ing cos.’ registers are offered the
following cash and share con-
sideration in return for their
present holdings;

In each case the market for the
operating cos,’ shares advanced
sharply following announcement
of the proposed merger, and
moved up further on publica-
tion of the above details.
The holding co. will control
assets exceeding £2i million,
and, after making the cash pay-
ments above referred to, expects
to retain about £BOO,OOO cash,
including war claims yet to be
settled by the Malayan Gov-
ernment. It will thus kick off
with a cash backing of about 3s.
a share.
Among the advantages ex-
pected to follow the merger are
(1) transfer of idle dredges to
existing or new properties, (2)
stabilisation of profits and divi-
dends through the spread of
risks, and (3) investigation and
development of new mining
prospects in Australia and else-
where. With the price of tin and
costs as they are satisfactory
profits should be earned.

Some day, like Dad, he’ll have a sugar farm
of his own. It mightn’t be very big (the
average size is about 50 acres), but he’ll be
his own boss. With scientific methods and
modern machinery, high yields and good

cane
land.
The 9,000 farmers in our sugar lands work
their own farms. Thanks to sugar, great
development has taken place in our tropic
North. A thriving white population is doing
an important job, and doing it well.
Australian sugar, produced by efficient white
labour, is cheaper than in most other countries
of the world.

Budget Realities
There is still a great deal of
inspired propaganda directed
against the Federal Budget, but
from almost nowhere has there
been a coherent, reasoned argu-
ment against it. “Labor” criti-
cises its taxation levies but not
its civilian expenditure commit-
ments ; some Liberal members
holding borderline seats are
quaking as to its possible politi-
cal effects at the next election ;
the Communists and Eddie
Ward are bitter about the de-
fence allocations; whilst an
utterly self-seeking section-of the
business community, with the
“Sydney Morning Herald” in
support, clutches at any argu-
ment, however fragmentary, to
discredit the Government in its
financial policy.
The Budget, of course, is only
an outline of part of the Gov-
ernment’s economic policy; a
very great deal depends on how
it is carried out. But the out-
line, in all the circumstances,
reveals courage as well as an
understanding of many of the
great economic and industrial
problems which the country is
now facing. The Bulletin has
little quarrel with the general
shape the Budget has taken. It
is up to the Menzies-Fadden
Government now to carry on
within that shape, at all times
giving sympathetic consideration
to private industry where the im-
pact of the overall financial plan
is harsh, unjust or likely to
hinder the achievement of the
main objectives at which the
Government is aiming.
Success of the Government’s
aims will depend a great deal
upon how the public supports it
in its efforts. In this connection
every member of the public
should realise that the desired
objective of putting value back
into the pound will be realised
only by effort from the public
under the direction of the
Federal and State Governments.
There are some silly members
of the community—some of
them apparently - “successful”
businessmen—who seem to have
imagined that value could be put
back in the pound just the same
as money - wages have been
increased by the Arbitration
Courts. They haven’t realised
that the initial onslaught on in-
flation means hard work and/or
some monetary sacrifice. Some,
indeed, appear to want inflated
costs reduced but inflated values
to remain.
The humbugs and self-seekers r
in a community are always hard I
to deal with in a time of crisis, ]
and they become a more voluble '
and mischievous element when
led on by the spittings and
scratchings of the “Sydney
Morning Herald.” The political
economy of Australia, to the
“Herald,” has become a very
political one indeed. But a
great deal more than mere
politics is involved in the
national financial and industrial
problem than faces us. There is
an extremely tough job ahead of
any Government that has to
attempt to clean up the mess
after long years of war, post-
war Socialism and trade-union
demoralisation the latter in
many cases the result (in Aus-
tralia) of a policy encouraged
for years by the daily Press.
The daily Press throughout
Australia is still probably most
forceful in its influence on the
public mind in its sport and bet-
ting columns. It is in those
columns only that some news-
papers are at all consistent. ‘
At the present time the
“Labor” party, led by Dr. Evatt,
is prepared to wreck the national
economy so long as it can wreck
the Menzies-Fadden Govern-
ment along with it. The “Labor”
party, indeed, often behaves like
a foreign body within the Aus-
tralian nation. The McGirr
Government in N. S. Wales
holds the key to the largest sec-
tion of Australian industry, and
“Hey! The Commonwealth Bank says We mustn't
do that !”
Mr. McGirr, too, has all his
forces organised, under direction
from the A.L.P., to obstruct the
Federal Government in every
way possible. The Communist
influence in political “Labor”
doings is too obvious to be
ignored.
In these circumstances the
responsible sections of the Aus-
tralian community have a tough
task to perform. In order to
stabilise our economy the
Federal Government, while seek-
ing to produce large Budget sur-
pluses, should endeavor to do
so as much through economies
in manpower and money as
through high taxation revenue.
The public should be pre-
pared to do a full day’s work
in return for a day’s pay. When
essential goods are short we
should be prepared to do with-
out non-essentials in order to
divert manpower and materials
to where they are most wanted.
And there must be a full under-
standing that, if we are to have
a Welfare State, we must pay
for it by increased production.
It can’t be paid for by printing
money in lieu of harder work
and commensurate taxation.
There are many sectionally
unpleasant jobs to be done in
Australia. But those things
which it is necessary to do can-
not be shirked. The Holland
Administration in New Zealand
had its actions against the Com-
munist-led wharfies overwhelm-
ingly endorsed by the people at
the recent Maoriland elections,
even though there was a good
deal of Press outcry against the
manner of doing it.
Australia’s Federal Govern-
ment should not be put off from
doing a tough job in (if neces--
sary) a forceful way. The anti-
Red referendum was lost largely
because of clever distortion and
misrepresentation from the
“Labor” and Communist side
and because the “No” campaign
was the more energetic one. We
have problems of inflation and
money, we have problems of
manpower and production, we
have problems of defence against
Communism, at home and
abroad. The Government will
gain in political stature if, after
honest and careful thought, it
tackles these problems resolutely
and regardless of sectional
outcries.
Wool and Shares
The spurt in wool prices early
last week had gone into reverse
by Wednesday, though on Fri-
day the general level was still
considerably higher than it had
been a month earlier.
The sudden rise in wool.
which amounted to almost 50
p.c. at one point, was considered
by some in the trade to be the
result of hurried “covering”
operations by international
speculators who had sold wool
“short” and had become con-
vinced the market was about to
turn anyway. Whatever the
precise explanation, it seems that
speculation was the main factor
prompting such a steep and sud-
den rise in the price of the staple.
Probably some increase was
due, but not so sharply or so
suddenly.
The sharemarket rose and fell
with the price of wool. On
Thursday the drop in some
stocks was sharp indeed, B.H.P.
lost Is. 6d. (to 525. 9d.) but
A.C.I. kept firm. As usual,
Sydney led the way in the change
of market sentiment. But by
Friday the drift in share prices
still left the general level well
above the “low” of a few weeks
ago.
The sharemarket is still fairly
speculative. But, though it has
followed the course of wool
prices in a general way, it has
not gone up or down in the same
degree. And at present some
reasonable yields are obtainable
from good-class second-line in-
dustrial stocks. Returns from
market leaders, on the other
hand, are still well below the
long-term Consols rate.
Tungsten Consolidated
From a report by a Sydney
concern called Tungsten Con-
solidated, Ltd., which announces
that it will apply for Stock
Exchange listing within three
weeks:
The potentialities of this [Western!
lode are such that when tungsten was
at a fraction of today’s price previous
operators drove a crosscut on the
No. 5 level of the Eastern lode a
distance of 380 ft. in an endeavor to
cut the Western lode. The New South
Wales Mines Department survey esti-
mates that only 20ft. still remains to
be driven to intersect it, and the con-
tinuation of this crosscut is the first
development work to be carried out
to open up this large ore-body.
No “potentialities” can be reli-
ably gauged by the amount of
work done in a mine, especially
by “operators” who gave up
when only 20ft. away from the
lode. Mining men have been
optimists from the dawn of
time. This should be remembered
when, after at least two “sur-
mises,” the board of Tungsten
Consolidated speaks of “prob-
able and possible ore reserves of
the two lodes” aggregating
“£5,000,000 gross.”
The mine is located three
miles from Frogmore, which is
18 miles from Boorowa (N.S.W.).
The co. has acquired an addi-
tional option over a tungsten
deposit known as the Rye Park
Tungsten Mine, 17 miles from
Frogmore. Some comparatively
small bodies of proved ore are
reported in the Frogmore mine.
The co. has an issued capital of
£lOO,OOO.

PICCADILLY LONDON W. I.
London Airmail
From Herbert Holman
A short walk in the crisp
evening air is all that is needed
to make one realise that Lon-
doners and their visitors have a
quiet yet solemn bond of sym-
pathy between them. To ap-
proach Buckingham Palace from
any direction is a touching ex-
perience, with knots of pilgrims
converging upon the gates and
moving in slow and orderly file
past the bulletin.
Now that King George’s re-
covery is taking its slow but
hopeful course there is wide
discussion upon his future plans.
Not only is it felt that the Royal
family is grossly overworked
but also his Majesty’s con-
valescence is much in mind.
England’s winter climate is a
cruel one for the chesty.
The question being asked is:
If, say, a retired business or pro-
fessional man who had under-
gone a similar operation fol-
lowed his doctor’s advice, where
would he go? Switzerland? The
south of France? Arizona? On
a sea voyage? It is unlikely
that the King’s counsellors
would wish for him to stay long
on non-British soil.
Australian Lord Mayor
London has saluted her next
Lord Mayor with warmth and
keen pleasure. Something of
the traditional romance of Dick
Whittington surrounds the figure
of 56-year-old Sir Leslie Boyce,
who is the first Australian to
reach the Mansion House. He
and Lady Boyce (also an Aus-
tralian) will often hear the Royal
Exchange bells chiming “Waltz-
ing Matilda,” although there has
been no last-minute scamper to
make the carillon topical—this
and other Empire tunes were
incorporated in the belfry’s
repertoire soon after the war.
Sir Leslie’s inaugural state-
ment has won him much affec-
tion both for its modesty and
for its gratifying truth. He
said: “When I first came home
after Anzac I had no relations
in the Mother Country, and no
letters of introduction. My
financial assets were restricted to
a small but favorable balance in
my military paybook. I men-
tion this to show that under our
democratic British way of life
the gate of opportunity is open
sufficiently wide to enable a
very ordinary young man, some
12,000 miles from London, to
find his way—albeit by a some-
what circuitous route —to the
Mansion House in his own
right.”
Conservative Aims
Some disappointment is felt in
responsible circles at the Con-
servative party’s election mani-
festo. The statement is well-
intentioned, and, with Mr.
Churchill’s signature in every
paragraph as well as at the end,
eminently dignified and read-
able ; but it is held to be too
cautious, vague and timid.
There is, it is true, nothing
ambiguous about the plain-
speaking preamble, which
states: “There must be no illu-
sions about our difficulties and
dangers. It is better to face
them squarely as we did in
1940,” and that the Conserva-
tive party “offers no bribes to
the electors.”
When it comes to hard facts
and practicabilities the general
complaint is that nothing posi-
tive or realistic is said about
their remedy. “Manchester
Guardian” affirms that “the
manifesto skates round them.”
The “Times,” while welcoming
the commonsense of the pro-
posals, makes the same criticism,
and adds that the vague talk of
reducing Government expendi-
ture would matter less if it were
stated boldly “that the cuts —
whatever their actual size—
would inevitably have painful
effects.” A searching editorial
in the “Economist” complains
that “no party seems willing or
able to inject into it [the election
campaign] new issues, at once
large and precise, at this late
stage”; that “both sides are
compelled to inflate the solemn
issues by emotion”; and that
both parties are inhibited by
fear from unpopular measures
which “would necessarily hurt
some people immediately for the
benefit of everyone in the longer
run.”
The essence of the Conserva-
tive statement is its expressed
intention; “We seek to proclaim
a theme rather than write a
prospectus.” This theme is
concerted effort —“by allowing
native genius to flourish and
fructify” with, “in normal
times, the freest competition and
good wages and profits fairly
earned.”
The qualification, “in normal
times,” is important. It implies
an ideal rather than an objec-
tive capable of natural achieve-
ment. Meanwhile, with one im-
portant exception, the broad out-
line of Government policy will
be unchanged. This exception
is nationalisation. The Iron and
Steel Act will be repealed and
all further nationalisation will
be stopped. Road transport
appears to have gone too far to
be unscrambled, but, with the
railways, mines and gas and elec-
tricity undertakings, will be de-
centralised into “regional groups
of workable size.” So as to
bring these industries under
closer Parliamentary review the
Monopolies’ Commission will
have wider powers.
The one surprise—an excess-
profits tax during the rearma-
ment period but with relief for
“ploughed-back” profits—is a
concession to abnormality that
has caused a mild shock to
financial and industrial circles, if
not elsewhere.
In sum, the Conservative mes-
sage says: “We have the right
ideas and the technical know-
ledge and mean to put them into
practice. WeTe hampered at
present by the nature of what
'we hope to take over, but we
confidently feel that we can
make a better job of it than the
present lot. Just give us a
chance and we’ll do it without
causing you to tighten your
belts.”
Election psychology is wary,
cautious and step-by-step. There
is time yet for greater and
grimmer realism. If the mood
of the nation should suffer a
chastening shock (and here
Persia and Egypt are the key)
Mr. Churchill is the right man
to tell the plain truth. Up to
now it would rather seem that
the elector’s capacity to “take
it” has been underestimated by
politicians of all parties.
A Real Tartar
No professional performance
of Marlowe’s “Tamburlaine the
Great” has been seen in Eng-
land for nearly 350 years, when,
it is recorded, one man in the
audience was wounded by an
arrow and many others were
injured during the sacking of
Babylon. The Old Vic. Company,
thanks to a collaboration be-
tween its new director, Tyrone
Guthrie, and its new leading
actor, Donald Wolfit, have
closed a gap that might have
stretched into the infinite.
Although the vigor of the pro-
duction suggests that some risk
to human life (especially among
the actors) is still incurred, that
would not seem to be the sole
reason why the play has lain in
neglect. The two collaborators
complain that Elizabethan drama
is studied as literature, whereas
it was intended to be acted and
judged on its theatrical values.
That is true enough. But the
values here are, unfortunately,
too “theatrical” to be higher
than blood-and-thunder melo-
drama. Tamburlaine was a
legendary figure to Elizabethans,
remotely terrible yet sufficiently
romantic as to provide much
harmless make-believe, like the
Turks to Mozart or cowboys
and Indians to the children of
yesterday. Marlowe’s Tartaric
pot-boilers (the original and
sequel are here compressed into
one) provided the 7ft. Edward
Alleyn with a contemporary
“Charley’s Aunt” that led to a
dozen or more years of un-
broken success. No doubt the
lively Elizabethan audiences
thought them equally uproarious.
But the world, which has learned
much in 350 years, has yet to
find an answer to tyranny and
its concomitants, sadism, in-
humanity and oppression. There-
fore the more squeamish reaction
of a modern audience may not
be due merely to a change in
theatrical tastes.
Nonetheless, any true theatre-
lover, whether student or gradu-
ate, will find much of interest.
Donald Wolfit’s Tamburlaine is,
without disrespect, best-quality
“ham” and his verse-speaking
superbly eloquent. Jill Balcon
plays his “moll,” Zenocrate, with
subtlety and a commendable
absence of leering opulence.
Tyrone Guthrie’s production is
sure and on a tremendous scale,
but needlessly fussy and pro-
vocative. In the more moving
second act, when Tamburlaine
loses his consort, slays his
cowardly son and dies painfully
but naturally, much dramatic
effect is lost. And surely Tam-
burlaine’s 14th-century generals
were not grizzly cavemen in
loin cloths, whooping and
brandishing Paleolithic clubs?


The Letters of Rachel Henning
[These letters begin in 1853, when Biddulph, Rachel Henning’s only
brother (then 19, and considered “delicate”), and her sister Annie (33)
sailed for Australia in the auxiliary steam clipper Great Britain.
Rachel and her sisters Henrietta (“Etta” of the letters, who had married
the Rev. T. W. Boyce in August, 1851) and Amy were thus separated, for
the time being, from Biddulph and Annie.
Rachel’s early letters are addressed from England to Biddulph and
Annie in Australia. She moved around from one part of England to
another, spending her time agreeably with some of her numerous relatives,
and keeping Biddulph and Annie in Australia informed of family, social
and political doings in Britain.
In August, 1854, Rachel and her sister Amy, with their cousin,
Tregenna Biddulph, left for Australia in the Calcutta. They reached
Melbourne on October 15 and landed in Sydney on October 23. Six days
later Rachel and Amy went to Appin, in N.S.W., where their brother
Biddulph had leased a farm from the Rev. Sparling. Rachel soon became
very unhappy and homesick.
Following Amy’s marriage to Thomas Sloman, of Bathurst, in September,
1865, and while Biddulph was establishing a new place on Bulli Mountain,
Rachel decided to return to England, where she arrived in October, 1856.
She left Amy, Annie and Biddulph behind in Australia.
After nearly five years with her friends and relatives in England,
during which period Tregenna returned home to marry, prior to settling
on the Shoalhaven, Rachel left Liverpool in the clipper Great Britain for
Australia on February 17, 1861. On her arrival she visited Amy in
Bathurst, Tregenna on the Shoalhaven, and then, with Biddulph and
Annie, went to live in North Queensland, w'hich was just being developed.
This is the eleventh instalment of the letters.]
Exmoor,
September 21, 1 863.
My Dearest Etta,
Since I last wrote we have
actually had a visit from some
young ladies, the first we have
seen since we came up here.
They were travelling up to the
far north with their father, a
stout old gentleman who was
the proprietor of twelve thousand
sheep. They journeyed with the
sheep, and had been five months
on the road and expected to be
six more. They drove them-
selves in a kind of spring-cart,
but as they only went seven
miles a day it probably did not
require any great skill.
They were nice-looking girls ;
one of them I thought pretty.
They were natives, and a little
colonial, as might be expected.
They had just left school in Mel-
bourne, they told us. I formed
my own opinion respecting the
state of the fine arts in Mel-
bourne ladies’ schools from the
specimens they exhibited.
They had an instrument with
them which they called a
harmonium angelica. Some-
thing between an accordion and
harmonium which, when pulled
out, gave utterance to a yell.
One of them sang to this
machine, just playing each note
as she sang it without the
smallest attempt at the accom-
paniment.
The night they were here we
had two gentlemen staying
besides our own party, and it
was quite a study to watch the
faces round the table —in the
struggle between good manners
and amusement. One had rather
a good but utterly untrained
voice and the instrument was out
of tune. The other sister had
an album filled with her own
and her schoolfellows’ drawings,
and there really was not one
that was not, as Mr. Hedgeland
said, utterly below criticism.
The worst of our “Mount”
drawings in the earliest days of
learning were works of art com-
pared to them.
They had been exhibiting the
music and drawings (they had
several music-books in the cart
which must have been for
display, as they were all piano-
forte music) all the way up the
road, I fancy, for I told Mr.
Richardson, the lieutenant of the
Native Police, that we had had a
visit from some ladies. “Yes,”
he said, “I heard of them. They
are very highly educated, are
they not?” with a sort of tone
which expressed doubts as to the
style of education.
It is a shame to laugh at them,
though; the elder was very
pleasant, and they both had
something frank about them
though not very polished. They
are going to stop some time near
Port Denison to shear the sheep,
and it is my belief they will both
be married there and never go
any further north.
We have such beautiful
flowers out in the creek now.
The fire-tree, we used to call it
last year. It is a small tree
covered with beautiful crimson
blossoms, bottle brush shaped,
as many of the Australian
flowers are. All the wildflowers
will be coming out soon. We
have them in the spring and
autumn. In the winter there are
only a few, and in the heat of
summer none except the gum-
tree blossoms. We have been
here just a year this month. I
can hardly fancy it, for it does
not seem any time. Time flies
so very fast in the bush. I
suppose it is from the easy, free
sort of life and from one day
being much like another.
We shall probably go down to
Sydney in January for a couple
of months. Except to see Amy,
1 do not care much about it
myself. I should have liked
another visit to Shoalhaven, but
I think the Biddulphs must have
left.
I have been making a lamp-
shade for the establishment of
“... then and there tied to a tree and soundly flogged ...”
the same kind as the one I made
for you. 1 foolishly left all my
patterns of flowers in Sydney
with a good deal of my other
property, but I got some wild
clematis in the creek, and drew
a wreath of it and it cut out very
well and looks very pretty. I
have also taken advantage of
some cloudy afternoons to make
some sketches which I will send
home to you when I go to
Sydney, though it is beyond me
to give any real idea of the
country. You will be able to see
how the house is situated and
what pretty bits we have in the
station creek, and that is all.
The house is so comfortable
now that it is all floored and
lined. We have a chest-of-
drawers, too, in our room, which
is a great convenience. You
hardly know how much till you
have had some months’ experi-
ence of “rooting” in boxes for
your things. Fpur looking-
glasses have likewise been set up
in the different rooms. We have
a large one with a marble stand
wherein I have discovered the
interesting fact that I look very
ancient and Annie more so
under the influence of the hot
climate, though it agrees so well
with me.
Biddulph is and looks very
well. I think he is pleased to
have the house and place so
pretty and comfortable. It is
the exception, too, in the bush.
The furniture was rather
damaged in coming up, but one
of the carpenters here is a
cabinetmaker also, and he has
put everything into capital order,
mended sideboard tables,
looking-glasses, drawers and
chairs,
A huge hair mattress which
was over the things and sorely
weather-stained has made three
small ones for the narrow
stretchers we all use here, and,
except that there is no glass in
the windows and I hope never
will be, you would not call this
an uncomforable home.
I must conclude. Don’t think
that because I like Exmoor I
can ever forget home and all it
contains, especially Bristol.
There is nothing like England
after all.
Your most affectionate sister,
Rachel Henning.
Exmoor,
October 15, 1863.
My Dearest Etta,
You have no idea of the
trouble it is to get a dress here.
I told you I remade my black
silk. The winter dress Emily
sent me did not fit in the least,
and I left the making for another
winter and did without, while of
the two print dresses she sent
me up, one I made entirely
again, as it washes tolerably
though not very well, and the
other does not wash the least, so,
as I cannot get into it, I have
not thought it worth while to
do anything to it. Annie wears
the skirt of hers with a jacket.
So you see such misfortunes are
likely to make one contented
with any wearable garment!
My Exmoor news is not
extensive this time. I think the
principal is that we have got the
room papered at last. We
finished it yesterday, Biddulph
and I and Annie and Mr. Hedge-
land. We did about half each,
and it really looks very well
considering that it is extremely
difficult to paper over strained
canvas, much more so than over
a good, firm plastered wall. The
paper is an extremely pretty
one, a very light green ground
with a small white pattern of
wild roses and ivy-leaves on it.
I am afraid it is tire true arsenic
green, but in this airy abode I
do not think we are likely to be
poisoned. It is the greatest
improvement to the house and
sitting-room. There is paper
enough for all the rooms, but I
do not think we are likely to
undertake any more at present.
Our room is lined with white
calico, and Biddulph does not
care about doing his own or
the rest.
Another improvement we have
lately made is that Biddulph has
put some arches of wire between
the veranda-posts to train the
passion-vines upon. They will
soon be over the veranda now,
and the shade will be a great
advantage as we have the morn-
ing sun in the veranda now, and
a house looks so much prettier
with creepers over the front. I
have quite a gay garden now,
larkspur and convolvulus and
hollyhocks and pinks in blossom.
It requires a good deal of atten-
tion, though, to make flowers
grow in this climate. They want
watering every night, and I have
no watering-pot, but go to work
in a cockneyfied fashion with a
water-jug and two pint-pots.
Biddulph has just had a piece
of ground ploughed up down on
the flat and sowed with Indian
corn, and we have had our first
green-tomato tart from the
kitchen garden. It tasted very
much like a green-gooseberry
tart into which a little quinine
or some other powerful bitter
had been dropped, but it was
very beautiful.
A few days ago we had a
visit from Mr. Prior, the
Postmaster-General, who was
travelling through this district to
decide on the places whence a
regular mail was needed. I
suppose it does not require any
great talent to be a “Postmaster-
General.” I hope not, for such
a goose I have seldom seen. He
talked incessantly, and all his
conversation consisted of point-
less stories of which he himself
was the hero. The witty sayings
that he had said and the clever
things he had done. However,
we treated him very respectfully,
and Biddulph gave up his room
to him, and I think he left us
under the idea that a mail to
Exmoor was necessary for the
good of the country, and the
tenders are already out for it.
So we shall probably have it
at the beginning of next year,
and a great benefit it will be.
He was very much disgusted at
the treatment he received at
Fort Cowper, the next station to
this. I believe it is the dirtiest
station on the road, and the
overseer would not lend him a
horse. Ido not know whether
this will stop the mail from
running on to Fort Cowper or
not.
Biddulph has just given me a
new chestnut horse to replace
Alice Grey, the mare that I
used to ride and who is, we are
afraid, permanently lamed. At
least she will not be pleasant to
ride again. He bought the chest-
nut when he was last at Rock-
hampton, and it was then very
poor, but after three months’
run in the bush it is now fat
and in good condition and a
very pretty creature. So it was
fetched up out of the bush one
day last week and shod, and then
a side-saddle was put on him,
and Biddulph, with a red
blanket, mounted him and
cantered round the hill; and as
he took the proceeding very
philosophically and even did not
mind when the blanket was
shaken before his eyes, I
put on my habit and took a
ride upon him in company with
Mr. Julian, for Biddulph was too
busy to go out that afternoon.
I had a very pleasant ride, and
the horse went very well and
has very good paces. I am glad
to have one of my own again,
as hitherto I have been riding
any chance horses since Alice
Grey went lame. It was very
kind of Biddulph to give me
such a nice one.
I walk more than I ride,
though. I take a walk twice
every day. The first thing every
morning after breakfast I go out
on the flat with the lambs or
else away into the bush with
them and then sit down under
the trees and read, while they
feed, till it gets hot, and I come
in again. I also take a longer
walk late in the evening after it
is cool and do not come in till
dark. The mornings and
evenings here are most lovely
and fresh and dewy and
beautiful.
We have been hanging the
pictures again this afternoon,
and they look so nice. There is
also the advantage of them
covering any little misfortunes
in the papering. Biddulph has
some very nice engravings,
besides the two watercolors I
brought out the Danehill
garden and Aunt's picture ; and
Annie has two watercolor draw-
ings of the Bulli Mountain
scenery besides the Danehill
house and a warm bit of sunset
landscape done by a gentleman
at Bathurst. I wish you could
see our sitting-room now; it
is so bright and pretty.
October 15. I must finish my
letter today as I think there is a
chance of sending it. Mr.
Hedgeland went away yesterday
to see after his station at last,
but he will most likely be back
in a few months as he is sure
not to like roughing it on an
unformed station, and with
small means, after living for
three years as a visitor on the
most comfortable station in

will miss him very much at first.
I am just come in from a nice
ride with Biddulph, along the
beautiful Bowen. We rode in
the bed of the river part of the
way, among reeds and long
grass, as now the channel is
comparatively narrow, about as
wide as the Tone at Bathpool.
I am rather warm and lazy after
my ride, so I will come to a stop.

Exmoor,
November 26, 1863.
(Finished December 2.)
My Dearest Etta,
Shearing is begun—the great
event of a sheep-station year.
We commenced on Monday
the 23rd. The new woolshed
is finished sufficiently to work
in, though not quite com-
plete. It is said to be the
best in the north; it is very
large, raised on piles so as to be
always dry; the shearing-floor
is made to accommodate twelve
shearers, then each shearer has
his sheep-pen behind him,
capable of holding twenty sheep.
Then there is a place where the
great wool-press is set up and
worked (you would be astonished
to see into what a small bale
they contrive to press from
4 cwt. to 5 cwt. of wool by
means of the press); and then
there is a place for stowing away
the wool-bales.
Everybody is busy now, and,
except at mealtime, we see
nothing of them. Besides the
shearing there are eight men
employed at the wash-pool; they
are shorthanded there, and even
John, the cook, is pressed into
the service, and if he was only
firmer on his legs, I am certain
they would seize on the old
blacksmith. The wash-pool is
down at the weir where they
have put up yards, etc., for driv-
ing the sheep into the water.
Mr. Taylor superintends opera-
tions down there,
while Biddulph
takes up his
residence in the
Pen-drawings by
Norman Lindsay
woolshed, sees that the sheep
are properly shorn and rolls up
all the fleeces. He has a large
wire table at one end of the
woolshed for this purpose. As
each fleece is cut off, he takes it
up, rolls it and ties it separately.
We have only Mr, Julian and
Beckford here now, besides Mr,
Taylor, as Mr. Devlin is away
on an expedition looking for
country. I suppose the shearing
will be over in about six weeks,
and then I am sure Biddulph
will be glad of a change and we
shall be thinking of going to
Sydney,
You may be sure I keep my
pet lambs out of the scrimmage
most carefully. They would be
frightened out of their lives if
thrown into the wash-pool and
dragged about in the woolshed.
Mr. Taylor shore them for me a
month ago. Two very hand-
some lambs were carried into
the store one fine morning, and,
shortly after, there emerged
therefrom two little black objects
that I hardly knew again ; they
are improving now that their
wool is beginning to grow.
We do not get many rides or
drives in shearing-time, but
before that we made some very
pleasant expeditions. One day
we went to the river crossing at
the Five-Mile station. Biddulph
drove the dogcart with Annie
and Mr. Taylor in it, and I rode
on horseback with Mr. Palmer
and Mr. Julian.
The Bowen is very beautiful
at the Five Mile ; a bar of grey
rocks goes right across the river,
which makes beautiful clear
pools and cascades among them.
We sat down under the shade
of a wild-plum tree which was
loaded with fruit. They are not
bad, those wild plums ; they are
about the size of a medlar, quite
black in color, and when ripe’
they taste very like sloes. Then
Biddulph instituted a new kind
of fishing. There were shoals of
fish swimming about in the clear
shallow pools, and Biddulph
and the other gentlemen stopped
up the outlet to a large pool,
then drove the fish up into a
corner among the rocks and
caught them with their hands.
It was great fun, and, of course,
the fish were so nimble and so
slippery that half the time they
escaped.
Mr. Taylor and Julian waded
about in the warm clear water
to drive the fish,
regardless of
damage to boots
and trousers.
They caught a good dishful of
bream, a good-sized fish about
lib. or in weight. We had
them for dinner when we came
home and they were very good,
only somewhat bony. We also
carried home a quantity of wild
plums and had a very pleasant
ride back in the cool evening.
Another evening we went out
to pick wild limes for preserving.
They are a little fruit about the
"One of them sang to this machine..."
size of a large gooseberry, but
in color, taste, smell and shape
exactly like a small lemon.
We went over some plains where
there was no particular road to
a “scrub” under Blackwall,
where the limes grow. Annie
preserved them the next day,
and a very nice jam they make
to my thinking, only they re-
quire a great deal of sweetening
—nearly l|lb. of sugar to lib.
of fruit. Biddulph is not very
fond of them himself.
We had a capital view of a
lunar eclipse last night,
November 25. We did not know
there was one expected and were
surprised when we saw the
moon, which ought to have been
full, rise over the mountains a
small crescent. We soon found
out what was the cause of it,
and brought a telescope and
opera-glasses to bear upon it.
In this clear atmosphere we saw
it beautifully. The eclipse must
have been nearly total; only a
very small rim of light was to be
seen when the moon first rose.
It lasted about two hours.
Biddy, the black gin, was
rather frightened, and thought
that Alick, her husband, who is
away on an expedition with Mr.
Devlin, must be murdered. You
should have seen the said Alick
the other day. We heard
screams of mingled laughter and
terror from the Irish children
in the kitchen, and, looking our
to see what was the matter, there
was Alick, with his black face
plastered with white-lead and
red raddle, hideous to behold,
and he was running after them
and saying he was “debil-debil.”
Finally he squatted himself on
the top of a box and howled in
a most unearthly and demoniacal
manner.
I hope we may get some
letters from you before these
go, but we have waited a long
time for this last mail. I hope
it wilj come soon now. We
also expect the drays up soon,
and the sooner they come the
better, for everybody on the
station wants shoes and boots.
We are all nearly barefoot.
Biddulph says he has nothing
left but a pair of Wellingtons,
which will last about three days ,
on these stones. Mr. Julian’s
toes are out. Mr. Taylor’s ditto
John the cook has no shoes at
all, and I mend my boots with
bits of leather every day, and
they will soon be beyond mend-
ing and I have no more till the
drays come. This is the most
dreadful place for boots, owing
to the rocks and stones, which
abound everywhere, if you go
off the beaten roads.
A few evenings ago I came
nearer to a snake than I ever
was before or ever wish to be
again. I was walking by the
creek, accompanied by my
usual “tail” of two pet lambs,
a tame emu and a bulldog, and
one would have thought that all
these creatures would have made
disturbance enough to drive
away any amount of snakes.
The grass was rather long, and
I noticed the lambs, which were
trotting on in front, give a
violent start, and, while looking
at them, I all but trod on a
large yellow snake that was
literally under my feet. I only
avoided him by giving a great
spring to the right. He was
coiled in the path so that I could
not jump over him as peo,-*
generally do. He slipped "off
into some hole, and I looked
very carefully in the grass dur-
ing the remainder of my walk, I
assure you. Annie was not
there. She never walks further
than to the kitchen garden to
cut vegetables for dinner.
It is getting hot now. Some
days it has been very hot, but
we get such frequent thunder
storms this year that the whole
country is greener than an
English spring. You should see
the way convolvulus grows
here this year. It climbs to the
top of the veranda, and the
beautiful pink, white and blue
blossoms look so very pretty
mixed with the passion-vines.
But most of the flowers are over

December 2. I must finish my
letter today, as there is a chance
of sending to the Port. I wrote
to Aunt Vizard and Sophy and
sent their letters two or three
days ago, but yours was not then
finished. We hoped to have had \
your letters to answer. We heard
from a Mr. Grimaldi, who
arrived yesterday afternoon, that
a certain Mr. Martin was bring-
ing up the letters from the Port
and would be here in the course
of the evening. Later Beckford
came in from the Nine Mile,
and said that Mr. Martin had
been seen by the shepherds to
pass both the Nine-Mile and
Two-Mile sheep-stations, and
ought to have been here before
him [Beckford].
However, he never came last
night nor this morning. It was
a pitch-dark night and raining
hard, and he must have got off
the road between the Two Mile
and this. We fired several guns
last night and again this morn-
ing to guide him, if within hear-
ing, and now the blackboy is
gone out to try and track him,
but it is almost hopeless to track,
for the deluge of rain must have
washed out every mark. He was
an old bushman, however, and
not likely to be lost so near the
station, and in broad daylight.
We think he may have camped
out in the wet last night, and
this morning struck the road
somewhere past Exmoor and
then gone on to Mr. Lark’s, the
next station—taking our letters
with him.
Biddulph is rather disgusted at
the wet weather we are having ;
thunderstorms every day, so that
just as the sheep get dry enough
to shear they get another soak-
ing. It is a week since a whole
day’s shearing was done. This
will delay our visit to Sydney
till February, probably. If it
was not for being out of every-
thing in the garment line, I do
not care about going at all this
year.
Ever, my dearest sister, yours
most affectionately.
Rachel Henning.
Exmoor,
. Begun
December 20, 1863.
My Dearest Etta,
When. I last wrote we had
begun shearing, but were sorely
hindered by the wet; that all
passed off in a week, though,
and since we have had it
tremendously hot, real tropical
summer weather. The ther-
mometer stood at one hundred
yesterday in the shady veranda,
and for days it has been ninety-
five of an afternoon in the
parlor.
The wonderful thing is that
people go on with their work
just as usual. The shearers
shear, and Biddulph and Mr.
Julian roll up and tie their
fleeces, and Mr. Taylor and his
gang (about eight men) stand in
the river and scrub the sheep
all day. I think they have rather
the best of it.
Shearing must be awful work
stooping over the sheep the
whole of these burning days, and
yet several of our shearers shear
one hundred sheep a day, and
one man who is a “cracker”
shearer can shear a hundred
and fifty, working long hours.
They get well paid, 4s. 9d. a
score of sheep, btit it is very
hard work. Biddulph says he
tried it when he was at Gin-Gin
learning sheep-farming, and
lumbago was nothing to the
backache it gave him.
Everybody will be glad when
the shearing is over. It is one
perpetual drive of work,
shepherds coming and going,
flocks “camped” about in every
direction (for they have not
yards enough for half of them),
and then they have to wait till
all the sheep lie down, light
several fires round the flocks
and then camp by the fires to
look after the sheep, and drive
them in, if they begin to go away
to feed in the night.
Biddulph and Mr. Taylor are
generally camped out somewhere,
for the shepherds are not to be
trusted at night, and Mr. Hedge-
land often goes out also. Mr.
Hedgeland came back on the
13th, having been away two
months. I do not know how
long he will stay, but I suppose
till we go to Sydney. We expect
to leave Exmoor about the end
of January, and have already
packed up and sent away some
boxes to Sydney, as they had to
go with the wool-drays. I
cannot say there was a great deal
in them, as we have not much
clothes to spare just at present.
It is coming back that they will
be full.
What we shall want for the
voyage down, and for our stay
in Port Denison, we shall have
to take with us on pack-horses.
Biddulph will want a change
after all the bother and hard
work of shearing, and Annie
wants to go down, but for my
own sake I think it is going
through a great deal of trouble
to arrive at very little. As the
boy said when he had learned
the alphabet.
Except Amy, there is nobody
I care to see in N. S. Wales, and
this easy out-of-door life with
the shady house and veranda in
the heat of the day and the
beautiful evenings to walk in is
far pleasanter than the dull
streets of Sydney, dusty or
muddy, as the case may be;
besides, I feel morally convinced
that some misfortune will befall
my pet lambs while I am away,
or they will be neglected. How-
ever, it is no use to grumble,
and we hope to be back here
again in three months, when the
hot weather is over, and the
beautiful winter has begun.
Sometimes I think perhaps
we shall never come back to
remain. Biddulph may at last
find him a wife in Sydney; for
his own sake I should be very
glad, for I think he would be
happier, and he is quite old
enough to know his own mind,
and well off enough to marry.
Well, if he does there is a
nleasant side to it even as far as
I am concerned, for though I
should be sorry to leave Exmoor
I should see England again, and
you and the children! Annie
would mind more, but I suppose
she would stay with Amy till
married herself.
I do not know what tempted
me to give you this dose of
speculation on possibilities, but.
of course, one often thinks of
the changes and chances that
may come, and Annie and I
sometimes talk of them. Since
I last wrote the drays have come
in again and started once more
with their second load of wool.
Biddulph has nearly always two
drays on the road going down
with jvool or bringing up
supplies. The bullock-drivers
are almost the best-paid men on
the place. They get 40s. a week,
as much a year as some clerks
and curates have to live on at
home. It requires a great deal
of skill and practice, though, to
make twelve or fourteen
bullocks all pull together.
Biddulph had two very good
drivers in his employ, but one
of them died on the last trip up
very suddenly. His dray had
capsized in a creek, and, as a
storm was threatening which
would have spoilt all the cargo,
he and the other driver and
some men who were travelling
up the road with them worked
very hard at reloading it. It
was a very hot day, and Miller,
who was a very excitable man,
overexerted himself, they sup-
posed. Whether it was that or a
sunstroke or heart complaint
nobody seems to know, but he
sat down to drink some water
and died in a few minutes.
Mr. Gordon, a gentleman who
was passing and who told us
about it, tried to bleed him, but
it was no use. They dug a grave
on the bank of the creek. Lowe,
the other driver, said he should
like “a prayer read oyer him,”
and Mr. Gordon got out a
church service and read the
English service over him, then
they fenced in the grave and
left him.
Everybody here was very
sorry when the news came, for
poor Miller was much liked on
the station. He was a German
by birth, and Biddulph is trying
to get more information about
his family and relations, if he
had any.
I told you of the old shepherd
Scotty’s death. Biddulph could
never hear of or trace any rela-
tions of his, and his wages,
something between £3O and £4O,
remain in Biddulph’s hands. He
is keeping the money towards a
church at Port Denison, which
has long been talked of, but they
do not seem able to get funds
to begin it. X suppose they will
as the place increases. Mean-
while the police magistrate as
the chief Government official
there reads the service t on a
Sunday in the courthouse.
There is no clergyman, and
no funds to support one at
present. People are married at
the registry office, baptised not
at all and buried by anyone who
is kind enough to “read a
prayer,” as the poor bullock-
driver said. The English
advocates of the voluntary
system should come to Port
Denison to test its efficacy.
We are looking forward to
Christmas now, though the
shearing will not be over; how-
ever, they will make a holiday
Friday and Saturday, of course.
How different from your
Christmas weather! I dare say
you have snow on the ground
and hard frost perhaps. How
well I remember the last
Christmas I was at home. This
morning was cloudy, and we
were all saying how nice and
cool it was, and so the
thermometer over our heads was
standing at eighty-five, which we
should call very hot in England.
We begin to shiver when it is
seventy only.
Annie has been concocting
mince-meat. She and Mr.
Hedgeland held a great chop-
ping in the veranda yesterday
while I was settling the week’s
accounts inside, and when. I
went out I beheld a black-look-
ing mass like a huge dirt-pie. It
was made of dried apples and
currants, raisins, spice, brandy,
etc., and I dare say will prove
very nice though it looks queer.
Of course it would be bad in a
day if you put meat or suet
with it.
We have doubts about the
plum-pudding, as we have no
eggs at present, and the fowls
refuse to lay. Mr. Taylor wrote
to Mr. Woodward, whom Bid-
dulph invited to come here for
Christmas, and requested him to
bring a few eggs with him, as he
keeps fowls, but if he comes he
will have a thirty-mile ride on
horseback, and it is very
doubtful in what case the eggs
will arrive.
We have actually had another
lady visitor since I wrote last.
Gentlemen visitors are nothing,
they come so often. There are
three reading now in the room
where I am writing, and as I
have to talk to them now and
then you must excuse any
mistakes I make, but our last
week’s visitor was old Mrs. Jack,
rather a pleasant, quiet old lady
who wore a large sun-bonnet
and made her own gowns.
Mr. Jack bought a run off
Biddulph, about fifteen miles
from here, and his father and
mother and several brothers are
living there with him. We
always intended to call on the
old lady. Mr. Jack used to say
he thought she would rather wait
till they were more settled.
However, last week he brought
her over to see us and she stayed
three days. We rather liked her,
but it is rather troublesome to
entertain a lady. They cannot
go up to the woolshed or betake
themselves to the store as gentle-
men do. I took her out walk-
ing with me in the evenings, and

meandered in and out of the

read a little and so got through
the day.
She talked a great deal about

commence a poultry-yard. They
have no cattle on their run as
we have, so they live entirely on
mutton. They are going to send
over here for some beef and
suet the day before Christmas
Day.
Our gardening is nearly at an
end for this year—this summer,
I mean—the sun has burnt up
everything. You should see how
the pumpkins and cucumbers
and watermelons droop in the
heat of the day, and though
they revive in the evening they
do not grow. We can get
flowers and vegetables for three-
fourths of the year, but in the
three summer months, flowers
none, and of vegetables okra
seems to be the only one likely
to do, that being a West Indian
production, rather prefers to be
scorched. When we come back
from Sydney I hope to do much
in the gardening line.
December 25. Christmas
Day, and a very wet Christmas,
too. The weather changed the
day before yesterday and today
it is a regular downpour; warm
rain, however, so we do not
much mind. I have been think-
ing of you much this morning
and hoping you will have a very
happy Christmas. We are
quite a large party here as, be-
sides the rest, Mr. Devlin got
back yesterday evening from his
expedition, having travelled
about eight hundred miles in
five weeks. Alick, the blackboy
who was with him, got very
nearly killed by the wild blacks
while he was out. Mr. Devlin
left him in the camp one day
while he went round to explore
the country, and a whole mob
of blacks came out of the scrub
and attacked Alick by throwing
spears at him. He had a revolver
and a double-barrelled carbine
with him, and he kept firing and
wounded several. They evidently
had never seen firearms before,
for they did not mind them till
one or two of them were
wounded and then they all ran
for their lives. Alick had a
narrow escape, for Mr. Devlin
picked up eleven spears that had
been thrown into the camp.
Two went through his trousers,
but without wounding him.
Annie is busy about the
Christmas dinner and Mr.
Hedgeland is helping her. It
consists of roast beef, two brace
of wild ducks, which Mr.
Taylor shot yesterday, plum
pudding, apple tart and minced
pies, with pumpkin and okra for
vegetables and watermelons for
dessert. Not so bad a bill of
fare for the Far North.
Biddulph was busy yesterday
distributing fresh beef and
currants to the shepherds, also
rum in judicious quantities. It
is a great blessing that there is
no public house near here, so
that they can only have what is
given them. At Marlborough
nearly every shepherd got tipsy
on Christmas Day, and were all
lying helpless under the trees
while their flocks were meander
ing at will over the country
Biddulph, Mr. Taylor and Mr
Hedgeland spent their Christmas
Day in hunting for lost sheep
which they afterwards had to
shepherd.
A black grinning face has just
appeared at the window with
“me want master.” The face
belongs to Alick, who has been
following Biddulph about all day
with entreaties for “grog” which
he does not get. I hear a sort
of babel in the kitchen, in the
midst of which Mary Anne and
John are preparing a Christmas
dinner for their own family, and
also for four Irish laborers that
we have employed on the
station.
The shearers, nine in numbei.
have a cook of their own and
buy their own extra rations,
everything except flour, beef,
tea and sugar. They pay a man
about £2 a week to cook for
them while they are shearing.
Christmas Eve, yesterday, was
signalised by a chase and capture
on the station. One of the
shepherds came in the night
before and said that his hut,
which is near the road, had been
robbed, while he was out with
with his sheep, and his blankets,
clothes and rations stolen. Bid-
dulph gave him some more
blankets. Yesterday afternoon
Julian came in in a state of great
excitement to say that the man
who had stolen the things had
just passed the station, and that
the shepherd had recognised the
blankets he was carrying.
Biddulph mounted Julian's
horse and went off through the
bush at a gallop. Pat, Mr.
Palmers man, followed, also on
horseback, and everybody else
on the station ran.
Biddulph presently came back
with the culprit mounted on
Pat’s horse. He conducted him
up to the stockyard, and the
whole of the property was found
in his possession. Moreover, he
had borrowed Pat’s horse the
day before, promising to leave
it at Exmoor, where he said his
own horse was left, and then had
ridden it on past the station
evidently with the intention of
stealing it.
Biddulph said he could not
have the trouble and expense of
sending him to Port Denison in
custody, one hundred and ten
miles, and afterwards appearing
against him at Rockhampton,
three hundred and seventy miles
off. So he had him then and
there tied up to a tree and
soundly flogged, Pat, who is a
stout Irishman, being the execu-
tioner ; and he bestowed two
dozen with hearty goodwill,
stimulated by the remembrance
of his wrongs about the horse.
Justice being administered in
this summary manner, Biddulph
gave the man some rations that
he might not be obliged to rob
any more shepherds at stations
and sent him off, at the same
time warning the shepherds all
down the road to look after
their huts.
There has been a great deal
of robbery on the road lately.
I do not mean bushranging, but
stealing of horses and robbing
shepherds’ huts. I suppose you
have read in the papers about
the bushranging in N. S. Wales.
On the western roads the bush-
rangers are getting so daring
that they robbed one of the
Bathurst banks in open day, and
went to a country house some
short distance from the town,
captured the owner thereof and
sent his wife into Bathurst for
£5OO ransom for him, or they
threatened to shoot him, and she
was obliged to get them the
money.
Amy does not seem much
afraid of them; I think she is
too much taken up with the
children and changing her nurses
to attend to their exploits. She
never keeps a nurse any time.
Certainly the Australian
servants are not good, but she
and Mr. Sloman are awful
fidgets about the children. Amy
writes in good spirits, and seems
well for her. I hope we shall
see her again soon now.
I have just been hearing the
exploits of Ned, the shearers’
cook, how he borrowed our
three camp-ovens and sat up all
night cooking for today, when
he could have had the said
camp-ovens.
The productions of his genius
were beheld this morning by the
wondering eyes of Mr. Taylor.
Two great cakes, six jam tarts,
small cakes and unlimited plum
puddings and beef. I think it is
fortunate that the weather is so
wet, and that they will not be
required to shear tomorrow.
December 30. I finish my
letter today, as there will be a
chance of sending it as soon as
the river is down. It has rained
ever since Christmas Day, and
both the Bowen and Broken
Rivers are in flood and the road
to Port Denison impassable for
the present. A man was sent
out yesterday on horseback to
try and swim the Bowen to
carry rations to the shepherds at
the Nine Mile, but he came back
with the news that the river was
“bank to bank,” and so much
timber coming down that he was
afraid to risk swimming his
horse. Of course the shearing
is stopped and the wash-pool is
washed away. The rainy season
has set in early this year.
Your very affectionate sister,
Rachel Henning.

Women's Letters
From Sydney
The 500 women who converged on Can-
berra over the weekend for the Women's
Jubilee Convention provided quite a lively
and inspiring spectacle.
It was delightful to see Dame Enid
Lyons, who presided, looking so well.
The array of talented women was quite
impressive, including the Countess of
Limerick, Dame Mary Hughes, Senators
Annabelle Rankin, Agnes Robertson,
Dorothy Tangney and Ivy Wedgewood,
Mrs. Guy Bakewell, Mrs. Herbert
Brookes, Mrs. H. Sterne, Mrs. M.
Tenison Woods and Sister Kenny. It was
regretted that Mrs. Isobel Green was pre-
vented by illness from attending.
The ability of women to be succinct
and to the point if they want to was
revealed when the delegates stood up to
speak for two minutes each on the work
of their organisations. The representa-
tives of the Penguin Club, Mrs. Jean Ellis
and Mrs. R. E. Krahe, did decide, how-
ever, that the ability to talk fast was a
necessary asset here. The Housewives’
Association, which was represented by
Miss Portia Geach and Mrs. G. Hain,
stole the show with the short speech “If
you don’t know what the Housewives’
Association stands for, then I’m sorry
for you.” There were lots of friendly
little touches. Mrs. U. Wolinski, who with
Mrs. F. D, Pattison represented the Aus-
tralian Women’s Bowling Council, said
that their council arranged for inmates
of mental homes to be taught bowls as a
sort of physiotherapy, “And I tell you
this,” she added, “so you won’t think the
council is just a lot of old women playing
bowls!”
In her speech Dame Enid said
“If I could, by waving a wand,
give to Australian women the gift
they need most, I would give them
a sense of national unity and
national pride in the achievements of
their country which I do not think they
now feel sufficiently.”
There was a good deal of lively debate
on the subject of equal opportunities for
the sexes, which was rendered rather ironic
by the fact that the same day the com-
mittee of an agricultural show in northern
N.S.W. had refused a needlework exhibit
because it had been done by a man!
However, the motion at the conference
was passed unanimously, so no doubt this
poor man will be given his rights.
On the resolution that women should
be appointed to boards, committees,
councils, etc., there was even more debate,
largely about the insertion of the words
“suitably qualified” before the word
“women.” Dame Enid was for the in-
sertion (“as a sop to masculine prejudice
and possibly masculine vanity, it never
does any harm”), but Mrs. H. Sterne
objected because, she said, men always
expected women applying for a job to be
“something very special,” whereas “any-
thing would do in a man.” There was
loud laughter when a delegate said that
she had been told that women couldn’t
stand up to such long hours as men can.
Most of the delegates felt that the con-
ference was valuable both as a symbol
and an inspiration. Clare Stevenson said
that one of its chief values was in promot-
ing harmony and understanding. Myra
Seavers, of the Air Force Association,
said that it gave the women in each
organisation more confidence and also an
opportunity to discuss their own work
with others. Miss Ruby Rich, a very
experienced conference-goer, said that the
best outcome of the conference would
be the actual admitting of women to
equality with men. Mrs. K. W. Burrows
said that one of the main values of the
conference was the stimulation of ideas
which each organisation represented could
spread to wider circles.
One didn’t look for much fashion
interest at the convention, but the snappy
uniform of Blair Bowden, director of the
W.R.A.N.S., demanded attention. Mrs.
M. E. Furley, representing the women’s
committee of the Liberal party, was
notable for smart and suitable outfits.
Mrs. G. A. Vasey was about the only
one to wear the new forward-jutting hat,
but pretty hats were to be seen quite
frequently, including a cherry one be-
longing to Mrs. J. Metcalfe and an orchid
one belonging to Mrs. J. M. Gordon.
Sister Kenny wore a purple dress with a
grey curly-lamb coat, a oattleya orchid
and a dashing hat with a cavalier brim
swathed in purple georgette.
The standard of hospitality set by the
Wine Producers’ Association is tradition-
ally high, and it is expected that Jubilee
Wine Week, when visitors from other
States are conferring in Sydney, will be
a most happy one. Even the weather
seems to be behaving (as we go to press,
that is), so that the visits to vineyards
and the dance on the Showboat should
have an extra attraction. Among those
welcoming wives of visiting viticulturists
are Mrs. A. Fiaschi, Mrs. Kenneth Hardy,
Mrs. Leo Buring, Mrs. A. Despas, Mrs.
R. C. Cooley and Miss G. Astbury.
The vegetable world must be very con-
cerned about the breaking-down of class-
barriers. Mushrooms and asparagus, once
aristocrats in the community, now find
their way regularly to the barrows in
Sydney streets, while potatoes and onions,
plebs and peasants as they once were,
are fostered and esteemed. Perhaps it
is this sort of thing that makes Treasurers
and the like so confused about what a
luxury really is.
This is a recent study of June Mc-
Alister, who is at present travelling
abroad. Before going overseas June, who
is a qualified woolclasser, was in the
sheep and wool department of the
Sydney Technical College. A keen
horsewoman herself, she was very im-
pressed with both horses and horseman-
ship at the Dublin Horse Show. After
touring Ireland, June visited Scotland for
the “Gathering of the Clans,” and will
later go on to Switzerland for the winter
sports. An old P.L.C. Pymble girl, June
lived with her parents at their Pine Ridge,
Leadville, property until it was sold last
year. Mr. and Mrs. J. O. McAlister now
live at Manly. Photo by Dorothy
Welding.
Various bits of information gleaned at
the opening of the Dunlop Art Prize
exhibition at David Jones’ Gallery
included the news that the Peter Bellews
(she was Helene Kirsova) have a baby
son. The Bellews are living in Paris.
Sali Herman had received the news only
that day in a letter from Peter.
Also at the exhibition was Robin Mc-
Fadyen, accompanied by Mrs. McCall
Power. Robin gave notice of a special
kind of barbecue being organised by the
Kambala ex-students for December 1. It
is called an Hawaiian Kava, and will be
held at The Hermitage, Vaucluse. Clare
Oatley, of Rawson-street, Vaucluse, is the
person who has the tickets for sale. On
the committee with Robin are Pat Glass,
Judy Marshall, Madeline Archbutt and
Sue Klein.
An impressive ceremony, followed by
a pleasant garden-party, marked the
Commemoration of Benefactors at the
University during the week. At a
religious service held on the lawns at the
front of the main building the Lesson was
read by Miss H. E. Archdale, principal
of the Women’s College. The Master of
Wesley, the Rev. B. R. Wyllie, and the
Warden of St. Paul’s College, the Rev.
F. R. Arnott, recited the prayer and bene-
diction and the Vice-Chancellor, Emeritus
Professor S. H. Roberts, gave an exceed-
ingly eloquent address. The only rivals
to the professors’ glamor caps and
gowns were the butterfly-sleeved dresses
of the Philippine representatives and the
long, sheer black dress worn with a
short silver satin coat by the Begum
Haroon.
The Royal Empire Society is getting
to work organising hospitality for the
boys of the H.M.S. Glory, which left
Britain in January and will be arriving
in Sydney on 24th of this month after a
long and arduous sojourn in Korean
waters. Lady Anderson and her group
would like to hear from people who can
make these boys welcome to Australia
by giving them friendship and care while
they are here. The personnel of the ship
numbers about 1200. Those who want
to help should get in touch with Lady
Anderson or the secretary of the society,
Mrs. R. V. Bryant, 17 Bligh-street
(BW 9387).
Alamein Day is to be commemorated
at the Cenotaph next Friday by the 9th
Divisional Council. The ceremony will
be followed by a Reunion Dinner at
Sydney Town Hall, for which tickets may
be had from Reg Mair at 39 Martin-place.
From Melbourne
U.S. Consul Charles S. Millet had to
co-opt Mrs. Rufus Ramey, wife of the
U.S. Army Attache, as hostess for the
late-afternoon party he gave at Anderson-
street, South Yarra, to give Americans
and Australians an opportunity to greet
the new American Consul-General, Mr.
Henry E. Stebbins, and his wife, Mrs.
Millet having an appointment with the
stork at St. Andrew’s Hospital, where she
had a son. With her green-and-black-
striped tie-silk frock Mrs. Ramey wore a
necklace of jade. The guest-of-honor’s
off-the-shoulder, ankle-length frock of
garnet-red faille had touches of jet on
neckline and bracelet-length sleeves. The
Lady Mayoress, Mrs. John Inkster, wore
a black silk straw hat with her black faille
suit. Mrs. T. T. Hollway’s outfit com-
prised a junior-blue wool duster-coat,
powder-blue frock and tiny junior-blue
cloche, softly veiled. Lady Herring con-
trasted her brown-and-white-checked suit
with a burgundy felt hat. Lady Collins’s
frock and small hat were in silver-grey
tonings. Mrs. George Jones wore black
faille and a gold-sequin-trimmed black
velvet cap,
Mrs. T. W. Liu, wife of the Chinese
Consul, wore a lovely national costume
of emerald satin patterned in gold. Mrs.
Keith Morrison added a black picture hat
to her black-and-white-striped satin
ballerina frock. Mrs. Harold Holt was
in black, Mrs. Everard Baillieu in apricot
silk. Mrs. S. Baillieu Myer wore with
her black frock a tiny black satin cap.
A black suit and coolie hat of scarlet
straw were Mrs. W. S. Cox’s choice. Mrs.
Earl Daum covered her black faille frock
with a mink jacket; her swathed toque
was of black satin. Mrs. Robert Mani-
fold wore a moss-green duster-coat over
black. Mrs. R. F. Sanderson’s draped
frock was of black silk faille.
Eighteen months ago, knowing very
little English, Madame Margo Brezny
came to this country. She formerly lived
in Bratislava in Czechoslovakia, where,
twice a year, with the exception of the
war years, she staged her own millinery
parades. She is wearing one of her own
models in this Broothorn photo. Be-
cause she was so impressed with the work
done by the International Red Cross in
Europe, her first parade in this city was
given for the Toorak Red Cross at 9
Darling-street.
Mrs. Walter Carnegie, president of the
Ministering Children’s League, with
members of her executive welcomed the
Governor’s daughter, Jeanette Brooks, at
the luncheon they gave in her honor at
the Windsor. With her fine-woollen
tailored frock in buttercup toning
Jeanette wore a white summer-weight felt
cloche trimmed with matching yellow.
Last Monday she had opened the M.C.L.
shop at Glen’s in Collins-street. This is
the organisation’s big annual effort to
raise funds for the maintenance of its
work. It provides holidays for children
whose parents are unable to do so.
For one week the shop is stocked by
members of various auxiliaries with
home-made cakes and jams, children’s
clothes and Christmas gifts of every de-
scription. Betty Everard attended
Jeanette in a silver-grey wool ensemble
matched with a silk straw cloche. Other
guests included Mrs. Eric Grimwade,
who contrasted a grey flannel suit with a
cherry-red velvet beret, Mrs. Bob
Lawrence, whose aqua-blue tailored frock
was worn with a black straw picture-hat,
and Mrs. E. Tilley, in black-and-white
straw coolie-hat and black suit.
Previtali conducted the Victorian
Symphony Orchestra in Brahms’s Con-
certo No. 1, in which Hephzibah
Menuhin was solo pianist. Hephzibah’s
gown of heavy off-white angel-skin crepe
had a wide skirt and fitting bodice, which
featured a deep bertha collar and was
heavily embroidered in gold scroll
patterns, with the hem of the skirt repeat-
ing the same motif. In the large audience
were Sir John and Lady Medley, the
Hon. Simon Warrender and Mrs.
Warrender, Mrs. Guy Hutchinson, Mrs.
John Daveron and Lady Scott.
Hosts at the late-aftemoon party held
in the Italian luxury liner Roma, the
lounges of which were beautifully deco-
rated, were the Master, Captain Carria-
nach, and C. W. Lucas, of James Patrick
and Co. Mrs. Lucas, who assisted her
husband, chose a black ensemble and
small black hat finished with a dusty-pink
feather-trim. Her daughter Cecily wore
a grey frock and small white straw hat.
A guest at the party who was also a
traveller in the Roma was Countess
Simonetta, who wore a small white flower-
hat with a black faille jacket-suit. Mrs.
W. J. Hutchinson’s navy duster-coat had
gold-braid leaves and walnut-shells
decorating the short sleeves. Madame
M. Vigano topped her black frock with
a small black velvet hat. Maria Carollo’s
black-and-gold-check coat was worn with
a small black hat finished with a gold
wool-jersey tasselled scarf. Mrs. T. J.
Ryan was in grey frock and hat. Rachel
Robinson, Mrs. Jon Stewart, the K. M.
Ballantynes, Col. and Mrs. L. N. Roach,
Mr. G. M. McKenzie and Mrs. McKenzie
and Mr. and Mrs. Frank Watts were
other merry-makers.
Jeanette Brooks, attractive in Red Cross
uniform, came straight from a nine-to-five
transport-driving job to the late-afternoon
party which Nancy Woodrow hostessed
at the South Yarra flat of her sister Mrs.
Edward Campbell. Nancy’s frock was
of white crepe. Mrs. Campbell’s grey
silks had a grey etched design and a black
velvet collar. Guests included Jennifer
Russell, Amanda Grimwade, Ann
Yuncken, Helen Simpson and Bambi
Shmith, who will be one of the manne-
quins at a short parade which will be
held during dinner at the Lucky Horse-
shoe dinner-dance at the Delphic on Cup
Eve,
Jascha Spivakovsky was soloist in the
Bloch Pianoforte Concerto Symphonique,
heard for the first time at the Town Hall
with the Victorian Symphony Orchestra
under Eugene Goossens, a very weighty
work. In the official party were Sir
Bernard and Lady Heinze, she wearing a
gown of black crepe and velvet and a
small black taffeta, rose-sprigged jacket,
and Mrs. Con Charlton in flowing gown
and matching jacket of lime chiffon.
Others in the audience were Mrs. Norman
Poulton, her green silks coin-spotted in
white; Mrs. Russell Coldham in white
crepe; and Vera Bradford, whose short
dinner-frock was of rose-toned taffeta.
Ideal weather for the Caulfield Guineas
brought out trim silk suits, duster-coats
in a variety of shades and material, and
coolie hats large and small. Skirts were
a little shorter, jackets hugged the waist.
A black silk-shantung jacket-suit was the
choice of Mrs. Norman Robinson, wife
of the V-A.T.C. chairman. Large black
buttons, diagonally placed on the hip-
pockets, were a novel finish. The new
“scissors” line was seen on the flared
navy grosgrain coat worn by Mrs.
Kenneth McLean. These panels were
attached to the padded hipline of the
coat, which also featured triangular
button-fastenings and the dropped
shoulder-line. Mrs. Alec Hunter teamed
a pale-beige suit with a London-tan straw
hat, piped and banded in white grosgrain.
Mrs. Harry Way’s duster-coat was in
blue-grey slub-shantung and was worn
over a blue printed silk frock. With her
black faille duster-coat Mrs. W. B.
Faulkner wore a beige coolie hat. A
black ottoman suit and a high-crowned
sailor hat in natural straw were worn by
Mrs. Eric Fowler. White wings trimmed
the front of the small white hat Mrs. Tom
Carlyon wore with her black suit. A
citron-yellow upturned felt hat made rich
effect for Mrs. Leo Guest’s junior-blue
suit.

up a vineyard at Bankside (S.A.) in 1856,
and in 1876 acquired Tintara. With
Michael Auld, president of the Federal
Viticultural Council, Ken Hardy has a
heavy programme in Sydney this week.
It started with a reception to inter-State
visitors at the Wine Pavilion, R.A.S., on
Sunday; on Monday the real business
began with meetings of representatives
of the winemakers, grape-growers and
distributors. The official opening of the
Federal Viticultural Council of Aus-
tralia was performed on Monday, with a
combined conference of the Federal Viti-
cultural Council and the Australian Wine
Board to follow before delegates could
wind-up with the more festive end of the
programme, Australian wine having pride
of place at all functions.
One day early in Hitler’s war, when
U-boat packs were striking ferociously
in the cold Atlantic, a very green young
sub-lieutenant boarded his new frigate on
the west coast of England. He was intro-
duced in the ward-room to his captain,
who was a prize U-boat killer, and
looked it. “Monsarrat, eh?” said the Old
Man. “Oh, yes—the feller who writes
books about us.” After which unpromis-
ing beginning young Nicholas Monsarrat
went to sea with his U-boat hunter, and
wrote a book (a very good one) about
him. Now he’s come out in London with
another. The Cruel Sea (first edition,
120,000 copies), his theme again the cold
savagery of those Atlantic battles, when
the almost sub-zero Atlantic was a
crueller foe even than desperate U-boats.
Monsarrat had the whole of War II in
the Atlantic, and wrote four earlier books
on his experiences therein. He’s son of
a former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine
at Liverpool University.
That cheerful nugget Bobby Gibbes,
who used to answer to squadron-leader
and is D.S.O. and D.F.C. (twice),
won his honors with the Desert
Harassers of the Middle East. Credited
with some 10 kills and many others
damaged, he added the other day
another to his “damaged” list —a Norse-
man aircraft which, having just taken off
from Madang, he had to land in a hurry
16 miles further on. Reported that
neither Gibbes nor his passenger was hurt,
though the plane’s a mess.
Leaving school, Lewis Edwards has
been Director of Queensland’s Education
since 1937. He grew up in the service,
and since reaching the headship had
exercised a more complete control than
most other State directors—almost all the
large secondary as well as primary schools
were under his surveillance. His big
problem—distance and scattered popula-
tion was overcome by a correspondence
system which spread the light to the top
of C. York peninsula and west to the
Territory borderline. Edwards had a
wide knowledge of his domain—he was
chief-inspector of schools for 13 years
from 1923, and was bom at Ipswich.
.. Gtz’: Novelist Frederick Howard, whose
Ao Music for Generals is keeping booksellers
busy, talked his parents into leaving England
lor Australia 30 years ago. Sixteen at the time,
he worked in a bank for eight years here, trying
to write in his spare time. When his first novel,
Ihe Emigrant, was accepted, in 1928, he gave
banking away to travel and get down to writing
as a business. Wandering from S. America to the
U.S., he was disqualified from a cinema com-
missionaire's job on Broadway through an
English accent, but found employment writing
dunning letters for a Jewish shirt-manufacturer.
Keturning to Australia he entered journalism,
edited Stead’s Review” and went to Russia for
Melbourne “Herald.” Besides the above-
mentioned books Howard has written three
others. Return Ticket, Leave Us the Glory and
Ihe Negroes Begin at Calais, as well as short
stories tor the “Saturday Evening Post.” In
1935 he won, with George Gill (a Bulletin
storyteller and husband of artist Esther Pater-
son), the Commonwealth Government prize for
a nlm-scenario based on The Emigrant. War II
service included first historical records section
lor the Western Desert campaign of the A.I.F.
and getting m the way at battles and being
mentioned. Later Howard served in New
Guinea as a lieut.-colonel, both as liaison-
omcer with Americans and on attachment with
MacArthui s headquarters. He was president
of the Melbourne P.E.N. Club, edited the
Army s hrst war book. Active Service, and is
at present writing editorials for Melbourne

Sketched by Prior in the polished-oak
comfort of the Admiral’s quarters abroad
cruiser Australia, Rear-Admiral J. W. M.
Eaton, D. 5.0., D.S.C., new Flag-Officer
Commanding, is a destroyerman with a
healthy respect for fleet-carriers. The
liking for flat-tops could stem as much
from his War II experiences as from
professional inclination—a. carrier handy
could have saved him considerable
bother. In January, 1941, destroyer
Gallant met a mine in the Mediterranean.
Jhe mine won, and
Eaton, driving destroyer
Mohawk, got a line
aboard what was left,
and, still under fierce
air attention, got the
cripple safely into Malta.
Ten days later Gallant
was bombed to pieces at
her moorings. On a
dark night not long
afterwards Eaton ran
into an enemy convoy.
He was happily engaged
with his 4.7’s when a
torpedo streaked from
out of the sea and
exploded its energy in
one of Mohawk’s shell-
rooms, an unhealthy
spot. The destroyer
was doing 25 knots.
She keeled over and
gracefully and definitely
drove under. Eaton
shifted to destroyer
Eskimo (a class-mate of
Mohawk), was in and
out of the North
African landings, and
was engaged in the Sicily
show when a JUBB
whipped in, straightened
up, and laid an explosive

Oscar Jones, is a bit of a rare bird all
round. Selected for the honor of flying
the Royal couple to Canada, Jones is a
53-year-old who first took wings in the
RFC. in 1917—possibly in a Sopwith
Camel. There are fewer than 50 pilots
who can claim to owning a Master Pilot’s
Certificate, and Jones’s is No. 8. After
War I a joyride pilot, he joined, in 1922,
the Instone Air Line, forerunner of the
vast ramifications of 8.0.A.C. His
War II joyriding took him scores of times
across the Atlantic, ferrying desperately-
needed planes and equipment to Britain,
for which he received 0.8. E. and the
King’s Commendation.

Waikato River, Rameka, up to the wiles of the
pakeha, ferried visitors across the river, making
no charge—but demanding ten-bob to come
back. A firm adherent to ancient practices of
the Maori (except in the matter of costume),
he pontificated at the Ratana Church in a
dinner-suit, a conspicuous blue shirt and a
gold-embroidered cross.
In Sydney, P. C. Mowle, after just under
half-a-century with the Commonwealth Customs.
A delver by nature and training, he brought up
from old records of early Australia his book
Pioneer Families of Australia; and he had just
finished what should prove a highly-interesting
history—that of the Customs service. His
grandfather, Stewart Mowle, was for many
years Usher of the Black Rod in the N.S.W.
Legislative Council; his father, Aubrey Mowle,
was a well-known S.M. in Sydney.
In Melbourne, Wilfred Henry Johnston, one-
time chairman of the V.R.C. stipendiary
stewards and a prominent huntsman in his
youth. The Craiglee Stakes was named after
his home at Sunbury by the V.R.C. in recogni-
tion of his services to racing. He became a
stipendiary steward in 1916, and was chairman
from 1924 till resigning in 1945.

A RISE IN PIGS
by GEOFF BINGHAM
THE Purcells’ move into the
End Farm was quite an
unobtrusive affair.
Ordinarily there was a to-
do about anyone moving in or
out of the Valley. There would
be an official farewell to the old
resident, and then a keen sum-
ming-up of the new, who might,
or might not, as the years
passed, be accepted as one of the
Valley. This did not apply to
the End Farm, because it was
natural that, on account of its
poverty, folk should be continu-
ally moving in and moving out.
Nevertheless there was a faint
stir of interest when Miss Arm-
strong mentioned casually to
each caller on the exchange at
the post-office that she had seen
a broken-down utility pass, and,
following it, a furniture-van.
There was little furniture in the
van, she hastened to say, but that
would be accepted naturally, as
the small cottage at the End
Farm would not be able to hold
much, anyway.
Mr. Tmweeke, the Valley
schoolteacher, was probably the
most delighted. He had dis-
covered there were three Purcell
children, all of school age, and
as this lifted his school into a
higher group because of the in-
crease in number, and con-
sequently added to his salary,
Mr. Truweeke hastened to write
a note of welcome. In answer
he received a grateful scribble,
and, the following Monday, the
three Purcell children, all astride
the one horse. This evidence of
poverty was not even
questioned. All accepted it as
fitting the traditional poverty of
the End Farm.
But, say and think what they
liked, Joseph Purcell turned out
to be a worker, and this on the
good evidence of Mrs. Isaiah
Brown, she missing little with
her powerfully lensed field-
glasses ; and, as she reported, the
Purcells toiled from dawn till
dark, erecting small low-roofed
sheds. These sheds were seen
to be everywhere, even at the
very top of Timber Cliff. This
latter was accepted as a sort of
permissible exaggeration, for
who would climb to that height
to feed fowls, or ducks, or pigs
or whatever it was Purcell in-
tended keeping?
“Fowls,” most said ; “ducks,”
said some, and one or two,
though in obvious unbelief,
“pigs.” The matter was dis-
cussed. If fowls, then he could
give up the idea straight away,
and someone ought to tell him.
The eggs would be broken
before they reached the corner
milkstand. Even if some did
survive that trip, the milk-lorry’s
rough-and-tumble trip to town
would finish off the rest. The
same would go for duck-eggs.
And as for pigs—well, every-
one knew you couldn’t rear pigs,
the price of feed being what it
was. Long ago Valley farmers
had given up keeping even the
traditional pig, for who would
keep a pig when you could sell
your whole milk?
So the argument moved back-
wards and forwards, and Mrs.
Isaiah continued to report the
erection of more houses on the
few patches of pasture which
showed between bracken and
brush. Miss Armstrong, when
she saw the pig-float go past,
hastily plugged in all Valley sub-
scribers and told them the news
in breathless tones. Mrs. Isaiah
Brown, who had missed the
truck, hurried to her veranda
and verified the news. True,
only too true was it that the
Purcells were going in for pigs.
They were disgorged from the
truck in large numbers, and their
squeals of delight and terror
floated across the Valley.
Oblivious of outside interest the
Purcells herded them into yards
and sheds, a brood sow here, a
boar there, until all were housed
and yarded, and Joe and Mrs.
Joe were able to lean over home-
made rails and regard their stock
with delight.
I T was surprising the pleasure
1 the Purcells could draw from
what Joe called his “patch.” The
couple could never quite realise
they had been able to buy a
farm so cheaply. If there were
high hills, poor pasture, and
much bracken and brush, then
they did not care. Nor did they
care that Mr. Harry Thrale
across the Valley had pastures
without a touch of bracken;
rich flats, and sweet hills for
grazing. Nor, again did they
feel humiliated by comparison
with any of the richer farms.
Sufficient for them that they
were in the Valley beautiful.
The entire Valley was shocked
when the news flashed through
that the Purcells were feeding
whole milk —whole milk ! Miss
Armstrong pointed out, mildly,
that the Purcell bails and the
Purcell dairy would have to be
renewed before they could send
milk to the board, but for all
that the Valley folk shook their
heads sadly, and gravely, and
wagged tongues disapprovingly.
Terrible to think of whole milk
being fed to pigs. Oblivious of
criticism, or uncaring, the Pur-
cells milked their few cows and
fed their hungry swine. Harry
, Thrale, who was generally to the
fore with opinions, shook his
head and said it was all you
could expect of bog-trotters.
Bog-trotters the Purcells were
then, although almost any one
of the Valley farmers could have
fished a bog-trotter from his
family’s past. It was understood
by all that in the blood of all
bog-trotters there was a love and
passion for pigs, and you just
couldn’t get past that.
The Valley was relieved some-
what to hear that Joe Purcell
had gone into timber. He ad-
vanced a few steps in the
Valley’s estimation. Timber was
a conventional job, like dairying,
even, and certainly far above
pig-raising. At the same time
there was an eager perusal of
the “Brookdale Register” to see
when the pig sale would take
place. Harry Thrale said he
might even buy a weaner or two.
No pig sale however, and no
buyer called, and it did appear
that the Purcells were going to
keep their pigs. Then, further
to that, the news was that Joe
Purcell was working at his own
timber, had let out a contract
for his forest hill, selling hard-
woods and a few softwoods
sticks and that he was being paid
for clearing tracks and felling
the trees.
Gradually it filtered into the
minds of many that the Purcells
had no intention of moving
from the End Farm, that they
were even going to make a go of
it. Cheques for timber, money
for working, a load of pigs
going away on occasions—yes,
the farmers could understand
that. The children still rode to
school on the same horse, and it
was agreed that the newcomers
were “close,” a fact calculated to
raise them in the eyes of the
dairymen, who were themselves
inherently tight-fisted.
As the timber was hauled
away, so was the forest patch
cleared, leaving acres of stumps
and ashes. Then no stumps, not
even ashes, but only young grass,
Rhodes, cocksfoot and rye,
with a bit of clover added later.
Isaiah Brown surprised the
Valley by offering to take a lease
on the Purcell farm. This Joe
gently refused. Isaiah accepted
the fact calmly enough.
HARRY THRALE decided
there might be something in
keeping a pig, especially as block
days were due in the lushness of
summer. He rode to the Purcell
farm on his first visit, and was
received warmly by Joe Purcell,
who called his neighbor
“Mister,” a form of address
which Harry Thrale accepted
without question.
“Look here, Purcell, he
offered, “I’ll give you ten shil-
lings for a good weaner.”
“No,” Joe told him. Not
selling, Mister Thrale.” He
shook his head and looked at
the fat weaner Harry Thrale had
chosen for himself. “That there
pig,” he told the dairyfarmer,
“would cost you two quid if I
did think of selling it.”
“Two quid,” said Mr. Thrale,
forgetting that the price of milk
had risen considerably over the
past years, and that the same
had happened to pork. “That s
robbery,” he protested. Why,
that’s all I’d get for any of my
pedigree calves at that age.”
Joe Purcell’s eyes lighted.
“Then I’ll swap you a pig for a
calf,” he offered.
Harry Thrale snorted. If Joe
Purcell did not know it, then all
in the Valley did. Harry Thrale
never sold his calves , not to
neighbors anyway. He had
rather kill them than risk a
neighbor buying into his breed.
“No, Purcell,” he said, and

TRAVEL RELAXED ARRIVE REFRESHED
SUNDRY SHOWS
Nolan Abroad.
To Sidney Nolan’s show of
tiny paintings from abroad at
Sydney Macquarie Galleries this
commentator politely dips his
lid. It has always been in his
smallest, postcard-size paintings
rather than in his big loose
posters of the desert that Nolan’s
underlying talent has revealed
itself; and here, in paintings
often no bigger than 3in. by
2Jin., nothing runs wild into
mere showmanship. Everything
has the added force of compres-
sion.
Of course there are influences
at work, both ancient and
modern: many of the paintings
are simply minute copies of
works he has seen abroad —yet
the show, as a whole, has un-
questionably a life of its own.
Of course, too, there is the
general contemporary tendency
towards decadence, a fashion
which will date like any other
fashion. The “Italian Girl”
(No. 31) is corrupt, evil and in-
sane ; so is the Italian or
Spanish “Patriot” —a murderer
like the savages of the French
Revolution.
But, then, this tendency is
counterbalanced by such grace-
ful, aristocratic little sketches as
that of the French girl—if she
is French—in “Figure,” and the
woman of the “Madrid Por-
trait.” It is offset again by the
delicacy of “St. Teresa of Avila,”,
the soft face manifesting itself
like an apparition, and by the
infinitesimal landscapes such as
‘“Outside Madrid,” in soft dark
blue and maroon.
The show is, in any case, a
report on post-war Europe,
which no doubt is fierce and evil
enough; and, whatever their
subject-matter or their emotional
content, paintings so forceful as
these need no defence. The
heads of the “Two Prophets”
floating in space are quite a
remarkable achievement in
a painting hardly larger than a
postage-stamp —the stamps they
use on the railways, anyhow.
And “The Apostle,” which with
the strong, rugged face arid the
jutting beard looks rather like
John Alden made up as “King
Lear,” has in compact form
much the same powerful effect
as that performance.
Mahler's Eighth
Symphony.
This gigantic work, the so-
called Symphony of a Thousand
—though for its first Australian
performance in Sydney Town
Hall Eugene Goossens mustered
no more than 450 singers and
instrumentalists —needed a hall
of better acoustic properties than
the big barn which is Sydney’s
only concert-hall of size to do it
full justice. In the first half, in
which the major part of the
choral singing occurs, those who
sat towards the front were
literally swamped in an
avalanche of sound which
swirled and eddied around the
hall from full orchestra, three
choirs, soloists and the grand
organ thrown in for good
measure.
This sonata movement, in
effect the allegro of the classical
symphonic form as established
by Haydn, is a great spiritual
outcry from Mahler, with a
splendidly - proportioned triple
fugue dominating the develop-
ment section. This movement,
chorally and orchestrally, is the
most shattering thing in sym-
phonic literature, and it says
much for Goossens’s command
of his augmented forces that the
work went along with no dis-
cernible hiatus and generally
with a fair balance held be-
tween orchestra and voices. The
two orchestral interludes that
occur, one between exposition
and development, the other be-
tween recapitulation and the
rather long coda, seem as the
centre of a moving vocal
cyclone, lending an uneasy
calmness. The three choirs,
Hurlstone, Conservatorium and
Combined Metropolitan High
Schools, laid their ears back and
went into the magnificent climax
to the movement in a really
inspiriting fashion.
The second half, which opens
with a tender adagio in Mahler’s
most voluptuously lyrical style,
was followed by various soli and
short choruses until the scherzo.
Thence more solo and choral
work until the great Chorus
Mysticus, which winds the sym-
phony up in a veritable vocal
tornado in praise of Divine love,
which is the whole core of the
work, as exemplified in the
redemption of Marguerite
Goethe’s “Faust” being the
mainspring of the second half.
Soloists were sopranos Patricia
Baird and Phyllis Rogers, con-
traltos Florence Taylor and
Elizabeth Allen—all with voices
of good carrying quality and
able to compete with a throttled-
back orchestra on even terms —
Allan Ferris, probably the best
tenor now in Australia, judged
by this and recent performances,
baritones Terence Hunt and
James Wilson, the former giving
one outstanding solo, and the
consistent-voiced bass-baritone
Frank Lisle. Maynard Wilkin-
son presided over the stops.
"Shadow of a Gunman"
The Genesians, who won the
N. S. Wales semi-finals of the
Commonwealth Jubilee Amateur
Theatrical Group’s Competition
with T. S. Eliot’s “Murder in
the Cathedral,” are now present-
ing an interesting, if not fully
polished, performance of Sean
O’Casey’s “The Shadow of a
Gunman” (Manresa Hall, North
Sydney).
Donal Davoren, the central
character, a man of good
intent and a poet, is introspec-
tive and weak-willed and for ever
retreating from reality into a
world of make-believe. While
devoted to the Irish cause, he
reveals himself as a frail reed
when put to the test. Seumas
Shields, his room-mate, is a
cheap)ack braggart, full of sound
and senseless fury and a coward
at the sight of a Black and Tan.
Little Tommy Owens is an
earnest spirit, but his prattlings
and indiscretions would be a
danger to any cause. Gallagher
and Mulligan are merely comic
figures of no substance, while
the superb Grigson is a magnifi-
cent drunkard whose stupendous
thirst makes trouble for himself
and all.
Along with this sorry collec-
tion of dreamers and drunks,
gossips and blatherskites,
cowards and comics who inhabit
a dingy Dublin tenement is
Minnie Powell, a charming girl
whose silly head is full of wild
romancing, but who, when
disaster threatens the group, is
the only one brave and clear-
headed enough to take action.
The standard of the indi-
vidual players in the Genesians’
performance was high. Bruce
Stewart, Francis Turner, Paddy
Turner (Minnie Powell), Peter
Kenna, Phil Desmond and James
Scullin had obviously studied
their roles with great care and
handled the Irish speech admir-
ably.
For a tumultuous play full of
laughter, despite its tragic
approach to life, the production
was inclined to be a little slow.
There was also a lack of co-
hesion —the players emerged as
individuals, but had not a full
grasp of the essentials of com-
bined playing.
The expressionistic scenery de-
signed and executed by Phillip
Hickie, and Joe Kelly’s clever
lighting effects were in accord
with the atmosphere of the play.
W. E. F.
Dunlop Prizewinners.
Prizewinners in the 1950 and
1951 Dunlop competitions, with
runners-up to the sixth place and
paintings acquired by the com-
pany, make at David Jones’s
Gallery one of the strongest
groups of landscapes seen in
Sydney for many a day. It has
the force which the Royal Art
or Society of Artists shows
would have if all the mediocre
work were weeded out, and if
there is nothing of the highest
quality the general effect is of a
pleasing solidity.
The 1950 award to Sidney
Nolan’s “Inland Australia” was
obviously a mistake. The thin
swirls and mounds of Ripolin
look thinner than ever, of no
force at all if you make a mental
comparison with such a land-
scape of the Centre as Hans
Heysen’s entry in the Jubilee
competition. William Prater’s
big “Landscape,” perhaps a bit
evanescent but full of light and
atmosphere, would have been a
far better choice.
Lance Solomon’s “The Yab-
bies’ Pool,” awarded second
prize in 1951 when no first prize
was awarded, is not the sort of
large and “important” land-
scape that wins a competition:
just a nice bit of the bush,
delightful in its depth and
authenticity, and so distinctive in
style that, small though it is,
you can instantly recognise it as
a Lance Solomon from the door
of David Jones’s long gallery,
which must be 25 yards away.
Some other interesting works
are a Mary McLeish impression
of figures and color - notes
around Port Melbourne, which
is like an up-to-date version of
a Conder; L. S. Pendlebury’s
“Suburban Station,” with some
lovely color in the dark-green
trees and an attractive precision
in the curious flat paint; the
landscapes by Charles Bush, Len
Annois, Fred Williams (an
adaptation from the Chinese
with an implacable circle of sun
that should be scraped off), L.
Meilerts, Max Ragless, Kenneth
Jack and B. E. Seidel ; and, last
but not least, K. Nichols’s large
green fish.

BRITAIN’S ELECTIONS.
A gleaning of British Press
pre-election editorial comment:
“Daily Mail”: “Infinite harm
has been wrought by a weak,
ineffective and divided Ministry.
No one can say that Mr. Attlee
has selected the best time to go
to the country. The prestige of
his Government has fallen so
low that he merely had a choice
of unpropitious dates.”
“Daily Express”: “Was there
ever such a lovely morn as this?
Misery melts and frustration is
finished. Mr. Attlee at last has
named the day. The joyful day.
The day of Socialism’s funeral.
The day when six years of
miserable misrule will be gone
London “Daily Mail.”
IT WON’T BE LONG NOW.
for ever. The day when Britain
will again get the chance to elect
a decent Government. Glory,
glory, hallelujah.”
“Daily Herald”: “Always, of
course, the problem for the
Tories’is to persuade us to forget
their past. Simultaneously they
strive to conceal their policy for
the future. This time no doubt
they will seek those ends by con-
centrating on the issue of the
cost of living. Labor in power
will continue to strive for the
agreed international planning
which alone can bring full relief
to the housewife. Meantime,
plans have been prepared for a
fresh attack on profiteering, on
monopolies and price rings, on
the chaos which private enter-
prise has contrived in such fields
as the marketing of fruit and
vegetables. All these projects
would be destroyed by a Tory
administration.”
“Daily Worker”: “We call on
all patriots and lovers of peace
to vote for the Communist
candidates where they are stand-
ing. In all other constituencies
we urge them to vote for the
Labor candidate against the
Tory.”
“Yorkshire Post”: “Mr.
Attlee’s decision to appeal to the
country before Christmas rather
than in the New Year is full of
significance. The decisive factor
in his calculations, we feel sure,
has been the gloomy economic
outlook. Grim months of
shortage and difficulty lie ahead.
As Mr. Gaitskell must have
warned the Prime Minister, the
country’s dollar situation is
deteriorating. Another fuel
crisis is threatened. Unemploy-
ment may be caused by the lack
of coal and other vital raw
materials. Further train cuts
have already been announced.
Electricity cuts and empty
grates are likely to bring more
harassment to the householder
as winter’s grip tightens. The
meat ration will shortly fall
again. In many ways the full
failure of the Government to
grapple with the nation’s diffi-
culties will become evident in
the months ahead.”
“Sunday Times” : “The threat
of disastrous inflation, long
latent, has been exposed by the
steadily-rising cost of living. Re-
armament and its consequences
have shown how right was the
Opposition’s warning against
prematurely exhausting all
reserves of taxable capacity.
The period ends with threats to
our interests and to peace, in
Persia and elsewhere, which
seem to have gone beyond the
powers of the present Adminis-
tration to handle.
“That record of trouble and
failure is not a mere chapter of
accidents,”
“Daily Telegraph”: The
electors have it in their power
to halt nationalisation and
undo some of its past mis-
chief ; to return a Govern-
ment which will repeal the
Iron and Steel Act and
reform the cumbrous manage-
ment of the coal industry and
the railways. By doing so an
essential step will have been
taken to stem the rising cost of
living, for a reduction in the
cost of coal and transport will
be reflected throughout the
whole national economy. No
honest statesman promises a
spectacular remedy for rising
costs; but with the Socialist
record before them the electors
will be in no doubt which party
points the way to bringing them
down. This will not be by sacri-
ficing social services, but by run-
ning them and the whole
machinery of government —more
efficiently.
“In foreign policy the issue is
fundamentally also one of
efficiency. The nation is, broadly
speaking, united in its resolve to
play its full part in the Atlantic
community, to consolidate our
friendship with the United
States, to resist Communist
imperialism, and to build up the
armed strength which is the
corollary of these policies. The
only exceptions to this unity are
the Communists and, upon some
vital issues, that section of the
Socialists led by Mr. Bevan.
The crucial question is whether
the execution of agreed national
policy can any longer be
entrusted to a party which
embraces the only Parliamentary
opponents of that policy—to a
party which, as the very condi-
tion of its precarious cohesion,
must be half-hearted in impie-
menting the nation’s will. Few
elections have been fought on
issues so wide and yet so plain.”
“New Statesman” : “Which-
ever side wins the election will
at once be faced with a dollar
crisis, a fuel crisis, a transport
crisis and a wages crisis which
call for desperate and dangerous
remedies.”
“Manchester Guardian” (on
the semi - detached Socialist
Bevanites’ election pamphlet):
“Its background is isolationist,
The need for ‘some’ or ‘a degree
of rearmament is conceded but
it must not be much. Russia is
‘not prepared to risk war.’ If
we change the ‘present balance
of forces,’ the present ‘equi-
librium,’ we may encourage the
Russians either ‘to enter the
arms race themselves’ (are they
not in it?) or ‘to start a
war.’ There is no discus-
sion of the actual Western
strength now available to deal
with a Russian act of aggression
(which, it is agreed, must be met
with ‘solid resistance’). Vague
talk of the anti-Communist
superiority in military resources
gets us nowhere; how long did
it take us to mobilise the Allied
resources in the last war, and at
what cost? The same calcula-
tions about resources were open
to the Germans and to the
Japanese. Are the Russians any
wiser?
“This pamphlet, like the last,
makes much of ‘fostering the
development of colonial
peoples.’ It never explains the
limitations of what Britain can
do and how it is the much-
abused United States that will
have to foot most of the bill for
any ‘world plan.’ The idea, as
the Bevanites present it, is an
empty sham.”
“News Chronicle” : “The
majority of the Labor movement
as well as of the country have
already decided that for the time
being defence must come before
welfare. The real national issue
at stake is how to preserve that
priority and still get the
maximum possible of both....
The heart of this problem is
one of getting more production.”
“Economist” : “It cannot be
taken for granted that Labor
will be defeated. Yet it is extra-
ordinarily hard to see any
method by which the floating
voter can now be won back,
Last year [when the previous
election took place] the differ-
ences between the parties con-
cerned means, not ends, and
within that setting both were
essentially on the defensive,
The Tories campaigned not on
their own policies but on the
discontents experienced under a
Labor Government; and Labor,
for its part, campaigned neither
on what it had done nor on
what it had left to do, but on
the memories of pre-war dis-
contents under Tory rule. The
economic situation now makes
it more unrealistic even than it
was in 1950 for either side to
promise better things soon. But
pre-war memories have grown
fainter and present discontents
have grown greater. If the
campaign is again to be negative,
Labor has little chance indeed,
“Times” (on the Attlee-
Socialists’ election manifesto,
and on their “warmongering”
scare tactics): “It is perhaps a
sign of weakness that Labor
spokesmen are resorting to such
tactics. The election manifesto
takes a long look at the past
achievements of the Labor Gov-
ernment-full employment, the
National Health Service, hous-
ing, pensions—and offers only
the haziest glimpse of the future.
There is a notable lack of
specific proposals. In the 1950
manifesto the sugar and cement
industries were marked down for
nationalisation and the chemicals
industry was to be ‘carefully
examined.’ In the new mani-
festo the word ‘nationalisation’
does not even appear. Instead
there is this touching promise:
‘We shall take over concerns
which fail the nation and start
new public enterprises wherever
this will serve the national
interest.’ Most of the other pro-
posals—or threats, including the
‘prevention’ of ‘large capital
gains’—are as vague as this. A
close reading reveals only one
hard proposal; the Labor Gov-
ernment, it appears, are seeking
a renewal of their mandate so
that they may ‘set up new
auction markets in provincial
towns.’ ”
“Financial Times”: “The
only hope of mastering the
country’s economic problems is
in a Government wielding an
effective majority in the House
of Commons. All the omens
point to a decisive result.”
Fading Dominance.
General Franz Haider, Hitler’s
Chief-of-Staff in the campaigns
against France and Russia
(quoted in New York “Herald
Tribune”):
“The overwhelming military
predominance enjoyed by the
Soviet Union since the end of
the second World War is begin-
ning to fade.
“An important subtraction
from Soviet power was the de-
fection of Yugoslavia (32
divisions). Yugoslavia is parti-
cularly important because it
stabs into Russia’s side and the
Red Army has always been
especially sensitive to flank
movements.
“The Soviet command in
Germany (and certainly else-
where) have—as was their duty
—warned the Kremlin that they
probably have only one year left
for easy conquest.
“The big question is whether
the Kremlin will try to grasp
Europe while the power balance
on the Continent itself is still on
Stalin’s side.”
Striped Pants at ’Frisco.
It needed a woman (Anne
O’Hare McCormick, of “New
York Times”) to note that the
only ’Frisco delegates at the
closing ceremony in morning
coats and striped trousers were
the six Japanese, looking “oddly
pre-war in the old diplomatic
uniform.”
Pre-war, in fact, they were —
men who faded out during the
rule of the militarists and have
now been brought out of eclipse,
particularly their leader,
Premier Yoshida:

and a rather deprecatory manner.

before the war. Like too many
members of old Japanese
families, he looked down on
politics as the British nobility
once looked down on trade, as
a business not quite suitable for
a gentleman.
“Even now, though he has
proved an adroit politician in
dealing with the Americans and
his own people, he has a very
non-political dislike of publicity.
He shrinks from public appear-
ances and dreaded the speech he
had to make before the repre-
sentatives of fifty nations. It
was comparatively easy for a
Government to accept terms so
notable for their generosity, but
it was nevertheless an ordeal for
a Japanese to make a public act
of contrition and accede to the
enormous loss of territory and
wealth his country has to
surrender.”
If any ghosts of Pearl Harbor
were about ’Frisco they were
unnoticed: “When Americans
go in for a policy of letting by-
gones be bygones they do so in
a big way. It is doubtful if the
Japanese as a friendly nation,
before the war, were treated with
the kindness and consideration
they enjoyed as a defeated
enemy come here to conclude a
treaty of peace.”
Military Intelligence
O.K.
Giving the figures for Russia’s
present armed strength on which
the British (Labor) Government
bases its urgent rearmament
effort, the Financial Secretary to
the War Office, Woodrow Wyatt,
stated in a speech at a Labor
rally:
“The estimates by the British
military intelligence of the size
of the Russian armed forces are
not guesswork. The best proof
that British intelligence service
is good is that it had got so many
things right in the past.
“It was correct all the time
about the build-up of Hitler’s
army between 1935 and 1939. It
also forecast correctly the
strength the Germans would use
in their attack on Poland in 1939
and the German attack in the
west in 1940. It knew the total
number of divisions which were
concentrated against us.
“The invasion of Norway was
not only forecast but the land-
ing-places were given as well.
When we invaded Sicily, the
location and number of every
division against us was known
except for one. Before the in-
vasion of Normandy, we knew
where every division and every
battalion of the enemy was.
“British military intelligence
correctly forecast early in 1941
that this country [Britain] would
not be invaded.
“I am sure I have given you
enough,” said Mr. Wyatt, “to
convince you that when the
British Military Intelligence says
that the Russians have got 215
divisions —175 line divisions and
40 supporting anti-aircraft and
artillery divisions—there are very
good grounds for saying so.
Those figures are supported by
chapter and verse. No one but
a fool would disregard these
estimates.”
Criticised French.
The air defence of Western
Europe (London “Economist”
has noted) is being held up by
the lack in France of airfields
for jet aircraft.
It reports that at least one
wing of American fighter
bombers has been diverted from
France to Korea for this reason
alone.
Obviously, it comments, it is
not easy for any French Gov-
ernment to take land from
peasants ; but so many political
excuses, have now been made for
the shortcomings of the French
defence effort that “the patience
of allies is wearing a little thin.
Having provided what French
statesmen have prayed for over
three generations—the presence
of allied forces on the Continent
—they have some right to expect
a more strenuous cordiality.”
There has been a good deal of
similar criticism in the British
Press, and some of it probably
provoked a recent speech by
General de Gaulle. France
should, he admitted, “put her
house in order and do more for
herself,” but he insisted that
“she was already doing in
Europe and in the Far East as
much in proportion to her
wealth and her manpower as
any of her allies.” The essential,
he added, was to provide for a
far greater contribution of men
from the United States and
Great Britain to the continent of
Europe than was now contem-
plated. There must be sufficient
not merely to hold an attack,
but to take the counter-offensive.
General de Gaulle (as re-
ported by London “Times”) also
said that Germany must make
her contribution to Western de-
fence, but this must be provided
for in a way that did not create
anxiety or distrust in her
neighbors. He complained that
Britain and America were
always “getting between”
France and Germany and so
keeping their mutual suspicions
alive. They should allow the
two peoples, who were com-
plementary to each other, to
settle their affairs together,
because the unity of free Europe
could be founded on nothing
else than their agreement.

After You, Please ! —A nice point
of etiquette seems to dwell in this
quote from a London “Fortnightly”
article by Gilbert McAllister, M.P.:
“Sir George Thomson, possibly the
greatest expert on atomic physics in
Britain today, has said that one
hydrogen bomb, successfully deto-
nated, might be sufficient to wipe out
all human life on this planet. He
concluded that the United States
should, therefore, solemnly declare
that in no circumstances would she
use the hydrogen bomb unless an
enemy had used one first.”
* * * *
Korea Signs. —London “Observer”
conclusion on the Korean situation
now: “The enemy has given a definite
first sign of frustration and weariness.
If this frustration deepens, readiness
to come to terms will correspondingly
grow. In the meantime, the case
against extending the military opera-
tion beyond Korea, at the risk of
making war unlimited and world-
wide, remains as strong as ever.”
* * * *
Acheson Triumph. —To the achieve-
ments of ’Frisco a London “Times”
correspondent has added the “popular
rehabilitation” of U.S. Secretary of
State Acheson: “Everything that hap-
pened was seen and heard by a vast
television audience —an audience that
watched the public in the galleries
and Republican Senators, as well as
the delegates of all but the Com-
munist countries, rise to applaud Mr.
Acheson at the end of the confer-
ence.” And, the correspondent adds,
it is almost impossible to exaggerate
what a successful appearance on tele-
vision—particularly when a victory
over the Soviet Union is involved —
can do for a reputation in the United
States.
* * * *
Military Japan. “New York
Times’s” noted military commentator,
Hanson W. Baldwin, has no doubt
about the ultimate result of the Jap
treaty: “For the present, Japan is
largely a base for United States
power, but in the long-term view the
Japanese peace treaty means the re-
emergence of Japan as a great Power,
and specifically as a military Power.”
* * * *
Anti-Americanism. —Noted by Cyril
O. Haule, Dean of University College,
Chicago, in a London “Observer”
article: “The American in England
today must bear on his solitary
shoulders the full weight of a power-
ful anti-American feeling. In almost
any company into which he goes,
particularly if it is Left of centre,
he will find the same pattern of events
recurring. When the formalities are
over the first lull in the conversation
is often the preface to comments, at
first guarded but subsequently direct,
about the general iniquities of the
United States and her particular inep-
titude in the international scene.”
* * * *
Moscow Miscalculation. —The Rus-
sian performance at ’Frisco is rated
the "most muscle-bound” they have
ever put on. “Their tactics,” a Lon-
don “Times” correspondent has com-
mented, “were certainly such as they
might have been expected to employ
had they given up hope of peaceful
co-existence and decided in favor of
the use of force when the moment
was appropriate. But the most prob-
able explanation is that there was a
complete miscalculation of the mood
of the many nations who, in spite of
their various and often conflicting
reservations about the details of the
treaty, had nevertheless decided to
accept it.”
* * * *
U.N.E.S.C.O. Screws. —A London
“Spectator” columnist quotes, in the
sterling equivalent of the dollars paid,
some salaries of British members of
the alphabetical U.N.O. outfit: “The
first [salary £lOOO a year subject to
tax in his previous employment] now
gets £3900 tax-free. The second draws
£3640, the third £3460, the fourth and
fifth £2950, the sixth £2BOO, tax-free
in all cases.”
* * * *
Peace Cocktail. —Those at ’Frisco
who were “anxious to enter fully into
the spirit of the hour,” a London
“Spectator” correspondent has
recorded, “could drink the toast in
the form of a Peace Cocktail, invented
and offered for sale in at least one
of the San Francisco bars. The
Peace Cocktail was made by mixing
one jigger of Japanese saki with one
jigger of gin.”
* * * ♦
Turkey's Inclusion. —As seen by
Edinburgh “Scotsman” correspondent
Patrick Maitland, just as American
pressure to force the Japanese treaty
through regardless of Soviet objec-
tions was an outright and deliberate
challenge to Russian policy, so will
be Turkey’s admission to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation. For
strategically it will imply that the
forces of N.A.T.O. may henceforth
advance into the Black Sea, thence to
threaten the 500-mile neck of terri-
tory through which any Russian
invasion of Western Europe must
pass.
* * * ♦
Strategic Persia. —Overriding the oil
issue, Persia’s strategic position, as
viewed editorially by London
“Observer,” is one of the utmost
importance, which it is vital to keep
out of Russian hands. “If Persia,
through a successful Communist coup
from within, or through Russian
intervention from without, were swal-
lowed up in the Russian power-
sphere—bringing Russia to the shores
of the Indian Ocean and to the flanks
of Irak, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan —
the gravest situation since 1945 would
arise, and the preservation of world
peace might become impossible.”
* ♦ ♦ *
Renewed Inflation. —In comment on
the temporary halt of inflation in the
U.S., London “Financial Times” sees
“a large money-goods gap” once
more present by the middle of 1952.
“There is,” it holds, “little doubt that
a renewed inflationary pressure will
ultimately emerge. But it is more
difficult to say how soon it will make
its presence felt. This depends very
largely on psychological factors. If
specific shortages do emerge at an
early stage in some sectors of the
economy, as a result of rearmament,
they may easily stimulate a wave of
buying in other sectors. That would
very soon shake the stuffing out of
the cushion that is at present avail-
able in the form of large stocks of
consumer goods. Whether and when
this will, in fact, happen is a matter
for guesswork.”
* * ♦ *
Israel Solid. —The “new Middle
East State” is just now getting a very
good Press in England. In typical
comment, London “Observer” says
of it that “at a time when in many
European States extremes on the
Right or Left are gaining strength,
the moderate forces have been
strongly consolidated,” and also that
“in a nation still living under a virtual
state of siege and wrestling with
appalling economic problems, orderly
Parliamentary democracy has now
gained a firm hold, beyond challenge.
lt is an impressive achievement,
and a reminder that Israel today is,
after Turkey, the most stable and
mature State in the Middle East, and
the most solid and reliable partner
that Western policy can find in a
disturbed and critical area.”
* * * *
German Rearming Unpopular.
Virtually all European statesmen,
including British (reports a London
“Sunday Times” correspondent), are
well aware that German rearmament
is unpopular, that it has “a certain
provocative content” because Ger-
many will be the only country in the
West that has a vested interest not
only in defence but also in attack:
“But Russia over the last few years
has forced the West to adopt so many
policies it would have wished to avoid
that Europeans—apart from handling
this issue perhaps more cautiously
than Americans —have no doubt about
its ultimate necessity.”

HAVE
CHANGED
TOO
The improvements that the
years have brought to car
performance have, to a large
extent, only been possible be-
cause tyre development kept
pace with progress. Goodyear
has made many historic contributions to the development of tyres
to their present standard. The outstanding safety, longer mileage
ẅ
and greater comfort of to-
day’s Goodyear Tyres are the
results of unparalleled ex-
perience that Goodyear has
gained in producing more
tyres than any other
manufacturer.
Again in 1951 ... as in
every year for the last 36
years, more people, the
world over, ride on Good-
year Tyres than on any

In the Talking Shop in Syd-
ney’s Macquarie-street there
was an atmosphere of great
amiability and joviality among
members of the three political
parties where but the day before
there had been nothing but
snarlings and snivellings,
recriminations and revilings. He
who had had slung at him “Yer
yellar-livered scrofulous louse!”
was now “Joe, old boy.” Not
since the last salary-grab had
the white-anted old chamber —a
condition of which termitic in-
festation was not entirely the
cause —witnessed such heart-
warming bonhomie. It was Big
Jim who voiced the popular
sentiment at the all-party meet-
ing.
“Nothing is surer,” he said
oracularly and with magnificent
egotism, “than that the tax-
payers would be the first to con-
cede that the dignity of Par-
liamentary government can best
be upheld by having in our
legislative halls representatives
who can devote their time to the
all-important business of State
without the fear of financial em-
barrassment which inadequate
remuneration must inevitably
entail!”
There being no taxpayer pre-
sent to shatter this illusion by
stating with brutal frankness
that if the whole lot of them
were to starve it would occasion
him considerably less wither-
wringing than if his fox-terrier
“Here, Miss —you don't want to get freckles .”
were to pick up a tick, Big Jim
went on:
“That members of Parliament
endure financial hardships be-
yond the ken of the ordinary
citizen is an undeniable fact.
Who among us, for instance, has
not been compelled, after a
night devoted to keen and con-
structive criticism of an intro-
duced Budget, to pay next day
for a bottle of embrocation to
relieve the stiffness in his neck
caused by his slumbering
through the proceedings in an
unnatural attitude on his fellow-
legislator’s shoulder?”
“Another potent factor in our
soaring cost of living, as a
class,” went on the Premier, “is
our having to travel free on
trains, trams and buses, because
the action of continually pulling
out and showing our gold passes
necessitates the constant replace-
ment of worn-out pockets.”
“Another thing,” put in one
of the “Labor” henchmen, “no-
body stops to think that by get-
ting into ‘the fights’ on the nod
a man’s liable to do his sugar in
on bets —if he wasn’t in Parlia-
ment serving the nation he could
stay at home and save his money.
We ought to help ourselves to
another two hundred a year to
cover that.”
“Well, for my part,” put in a
very Liberal member with other
people’s money, “I think a
salary-rise of five hundred a
year is justified to cover the in-
creased cost of throat jubes—in
fact, when you come to consider
the increased sales tax on tal-
cum-powder, which I’ve got to
sprinkle on my feet to ease the
strain of leaping up and making
interjections when there’s a good
gallery, it should be nearer six
hundred.”
“Quite apart,” said a rural
member, “from the stagger-
ing cost to us in boot-
leather through having to walk,
during the two and a half
months in the year that we work,
from where we park our cars
into the Chamber —fully twenty
yards—the fact that we have to
fill in the other nine and a half
months playing golf or bowls
imposes a terrific strain on our
financial resources. What other
section of the community, I ask,
is crushed by the burden of so
often replacing golf-balls at over
five shillings each, of replacing
trousers that wear out pre-
maturely from so much bending
down in the rinks? Is it fair
that men who, in the State’s
service, work their brains to the
bone for ten weeks a year should
have to put up with the grinding
poverty of twenty-six pounds a
week?”
Just then a voice spoke up
from the back: “Well, 1 for one
think we’re paid pretty hand-
somely as it is. To soak the
already-overburdened taxpayers
any more would be nothing
short of daylight rob”
The concerted howl of derision
directed at this traitor to the
Sacred Cause, could it have
been translated into units of
power, would have been suffi-
cient to run Bunnerong until the
next boiler broke down.
“Another thing which would
more than justify giving our-
selves a substantial increase in
salary,” interpolated McGirr’s
Minister for Issuing Threats to
Housewives, “is the extra expense
involved when we attend free
dinners —it means putting in
threepence every time for a hat-
check. It’s expected of us. No
doubt it is part of the sacrifice
we all make in becoming Parlia-
mentarians, but it is high time
relief was afforded us.”
“Well,” put in the Minister for
Butter and Potato Shortages, “it
boils down to this; since we
helped ourselves to the last
salary-rise the basic wage has
shot up about three quid. That
justifies our taking at least twelve
quid a week, just in case the
forthcoming quarterly basic-
wage adjustment is a nine-pound--
a-week jump. Such a spectacular
rise has never occurred before,
admittedly, but we should be
prepared for all emergencies.
Another thing that warrants an
increase is that I buy two woollen
ties a year, and you know how
wool jumped at the last sales.”
Big Jim held up his hand, his
fist not quite clenched. “All
right, boys—agreed? As the
servants of the people we’ll go
through the people’s pockets.
They’re too dumb to wake up
if a house fell on them; and
they couldn’t get at us if they
wanted to, at least not while my
majority keeps on being a good
fellow and votes with us to save
his own skin. Anyway, we’re all
in the same boat now.”
“Ar, to hell with the electors,”
sang out a back-bencher who
held a safe seat. “Anyone’d think
just because they paid our screws
they had the right to say how
much we’d get!”

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT’S
RED MILL RUM.
The Sydney spring racing done,
interest shifts now to Melbourne as
that mystic date the first Tuesday in
November draws on apace. Mean-
while the scene is occupied by the
V.A.T.C. spring meeting, which
kicked-oif on Saturday, continues
today and culminates in the running
of the Caulfield Cup next Saturday.
An excellent afternoon’s racing on
Saturday was singularly unproductive
of winning favorites, but it did lay
bare quite a swag of assorted Caul-
field Cup form, notably the winning
performances of Durham and Jovial
Lad and the also-ran efforts of Mid-
way, Double Blank, Blue Vest and
Jan. Jovial Lad won the mile Toorak
Handicap, which, in the past, has
often offered a fair Caulfield Cup
guide. Midway and Double Blank
filled the places behind Durham in
the Herbert Power Handicap run over
the Cup course and Blue Vest and
Jan finished further back in the same
event.
Some critics maintain that jockeys
themselves are about the world’s
worst judges of winning prospects,
but after Durham had brilliantly won
the Herbert Power Handicap, with
Jan disappointing badly in that race,
J. Purteli looked to have been on
pretty sound ground when, earlier in
the week, he had rejected an offer to
ride the imported mare in the Cup,
expressing a preference for the grey.
Durham’s was an outstanding Cup
trial. Contrary to his usual practice
of dropping a long way back in the
early stages, on Saturday the grey
was always bowling along comfort-
ably well up with the leaders. The
Westralian horse Royal Brocade, who
had been backed to hot favoritism,
attempted to lead all the way after
being hard ridden to get to the front
from his outside barrier position.
When Royal Brocade and the Queens-
lander Blue Vest, who had also been
handy, weakened in the straight Pur-
toll shot Durham through, and in a
trice had the race safely won. Midway
and Double Blank finished on well,
but with no chance of running down
Durham, who scored by a length; a
half-head separated Midway and
Double Blank.
hast year Grey Boots won the double
of Toorak Handicap and Caulfield
Cup, and four-year-old Jovial Lad did
not lack admirers prepared to back
him to complete the same double after
he had dashingly won the first leg
on Saturday. Half-a-mile from home
in the Toorak, Jovial Lad appeared
quite hopelessly placed ; he was a
long way back and being forced to
race very wide. However, as they
turned for home, with the favorite
Laurie Hussar going to the front, it
could be seen that Jovial Lad, finish-
ing brilliantly, would certainly take a
hand in the finish. Welkin Sun had
the edge on Laurie Hussar nearing
the post, but neither was able to
withstand Jovial Lad’s withering
finish; he won by three-parts of a
length, with a half-head between the
minor placegetiers.
Summing-up, then, observations of
Caulfield Cup candidates on Saturday.
The winners Durham and Jovial Lad
both looked excellent Cup prospects,
though with Jovial Lad somewhat
under a shadow; he is reported to
have very “iffey” legs and to have
given connections anxiety after
Saturday’s win. Laurie Hussar, who
had been much fancied for the Cup,
gave the impression in his Toorak
run that the 12-furlongs journey may
be beyond him. Full-brother to the
recent A.J.C. Metropolitan winner
Delta, Midway ran a cracking good
race behind Durham, without, how-
ever, giving any sound reason to
suppose that he will reverse the result
when he meets the same horse next
Saturday over the same course and
on only 11b. better terms. There
was more reason to expect improve-
ment from Saturday’s third place-
getter, Double Blank, who is, inci-
dentally, also a full brother to a
good ’un —Chicquita. Double Blank
was finishing-on possibly the best of
the trio, and he will meet Durham
on 81b. better terms and Midway on
71b. better in the Cup. Chicquita
was the early favorite for the Caul-
field Cup, but after disappointing in
her preparation she was first with-
drawn from the Cups and then last
week retired from racing altogether.
It would be odd if her less-
distinguished brother now should win
the big handicap.
Of other Cup candidates who con-
tested the Herbert Power Handicap,
Royal Brocade one would feel obliged
to dismiss. Blue Vest disappointed
at the finish, and, though he should
be much improved by the run, he
did not look quite ripe, and the Mel-
bourne Cup is more probably his
main mission. The imported mare
Jan, who had rocketed to Cup
favoritism on her Sydney perform-
ances, swiftly plummeted in the
light of her first Melbourne appear-
ance, but that may represent prema-
ture and over-hasty judgment upon
her. She appeared on Saturday to
be rather hastily ridden in that she
commenced her finishing run nearly
six furlongs from home, with the
not-surprising result that she had shot
her bolt well before the post was
reached. With more patient riding
she could give a vastly better account
of herself next Saturday, when she
will be meeting the others on much
better terms.
Consideration of the various per-
formances mentioned naturally led
to extensive reshuffling of the
Caulfield Cup betting order. Amidst
all the hailing of new and bewailing
of old fancies there was possibly a
tendency to overlook one or two
trifles who didn’t happen to race on
Saturday. One who comes very much
to mind is the Queenslander Basha
Felika, and that very solid customer
Iron Duke could be another. At all
events, summing them up, present
observer’s order of fancy for the
Caulfield Cup is: Durham, 1; Basha
Felika, 2; Double Blank, 3; Iron i
Duke, 4; Jovial Lad, 5.
The present discussion of the Caul-
field Cup presumes one thing—that
Grey Boots will not be a contender.
If he should tackle that race he
would, of course, take a power of
beating. However, our notion is that
the Melbourne Cup is, and has been
for the past 12 months, his mission,
and, while doubles of any description
are perilous things to touch; while
the Caulfield-Melbourne Cups double
is undoubtedly the most perilous of
them all; and while the fact that
only one grey has ever won the Caul-
field Cup and only two the Melbourne
Cup should possibly dissuade one
from selecting a pair of ’em for the
double, Durham-Grey Boots is a
double of strong appeal.
Also run on Saturday last, the mile
Caulfield Guineas gave students a
first opportunity to compare, en
masse, the best of the Sydney and
Melbourne three-year-olds, albeit the
A.J.C. Derby winner Channel Rise
was not a starter, nor was the Mel-
bournite Shoreham, who alone went
north for the A.J.C. classic. The
outcome, at all events, was a clear
victory for the Sydney visitors, who
supplied three of the first four past
the post, including the winner.
Melbourne punters who may have
wondered how their Sydney confreres
became so enamored of Hydrogen
as to send him out one of the hottest
favorites on record for the A.J.C.
Derby doubtless saw the light after
witnessing the colt simply paralyse
Saturday’s Guineas Field. Hydrogen
missed the start, and was soon tailed-
off last in the field of 20, which,
from past experience, was what one
expected. However, Munro then pro-
ceeded to employ somewhat unex-
pected tactics; he began to drive his
mount along from the five-furlongs
mark, and in the straight run from
there to the turn Hydrogen simply
gobbled-up the field, which fellow-
Sydneysider Free Rule had been lead-
ing along at a smart bat. Hydrogen
had them covered turning for home,
and, continuing his run powerfully,
he won by a neck from Diplomacy,
who hung on well to do easily the
best of the Melbourne colts. Free
Rule stuck on fairly for third money,
but unless he is amenable to being
ridden a very different type of race
“Pipe down, you're not at home now—this is the bloke
who tells me what to do!”
one cannot readily envision him as
a real stayer. The very honest colt
Montana, after being badly served in
the barrier draw, came home well to
finish fourth, and will again be one
of the hardest to beat in the Victoria
Derby. Fifth in the Guineas was the
Tasmanian filly Dassie, with a run
suggestive of Oaks prospects.
* * * *
Favorites being beaten in all seven
events at Randwick on Saturday, the
meeting (a City Tattersall’s Club
fixture incidentally) was one which
will doubtless be long remembered
with pleasure by the bookmaking
fraternity. However, at least one
punter will bear no-less-pleasant
recollections of the occasion. He was
the gentleman who, employing some
occult science, contrived to couple
Johnny Zero and Val Ali on the
doubles tote, which, since he was
the only person to do so, returned a
palatable morsel of £3120 10s. 6d. for
five-bob.
The Johnny Zero-Val Ali dividend
is easily the best recorded in Aus-
tralia to date, working out at roughly
12,480 to 1. In New Zealand early
this year there was a dividend of
£8179-odd for a double, but that
was on a £1 unit. Probably easily
the world-record dividend was the
35,600 to 1 paid by Jockey Treble-
Caughoo when they won the Lincoln-
shire-Grand National double in
England a few years back.
A seemingly evergreen veteran of
some 10 summers, Johnny Zero
started at 16 to 1, well backed in
from twenty-fives, and came home
with a rattling burst from the tail of
the field to win Saturday’s main event,
the City Tattersall’s Gold Cup of 12
furlongs. Val Ali, a four-year-old
utterly devoid of form, either recent
or ancient, started at 200 to 1 and
led all the way to win the 10-furlongs
Novice.
Another hefty dividend was returned
when Mercury just pipped Nitrogen
in the mile Members’ Handicap for
three-year-olds. Mercury was pretty
well fancied to start at 11 to 2, but,
coupled with the friendless Val Ali,
he returned £BBB 15s. Other divi-
dends were, by contrast, compara-
tively sane, but altogether provided a
fair advertisement for the doubles
machine. Having his first run in
several months, Grand Monarch
downed Lloric and odds-on favorite
Carriole in the George Herdsman
Stakes, and in conjunction with
Johny Zero returned a doubles divi-
dend of £B6-odd. Taken with Ocean
Spray, a Neptune colt who won the
Youthful Stakes (5f.) rather impres-
sively, Grand Monarch paid some £4O.

After 30-odd years of enduring
placidly the slings and arrows of out-
raged owners A.J.C. handicapper
Fred Wilson has decided to call it a
day. Wilson entered the employ of
the A.J.C. as a clerk 52 years ago,
rose through the ranks to the posi-
tion of assistant handicapper, and
became handicapper in 1919. On
occasions present writer has been
among those weighing-in with a spot
of criticism of some assessment of
Wilson’s, but never without the pre-
cautionary utterance “While the handi-
capper usually proves right ”;
and far more often than ever not
Wilson was right. Mr. Wilson retires
officially at the end of the year, to
be succeeded by the present assistant
handicapper, former S.T.C. handi-
capper lan Feaks.

Sydney cricket fans will get their
first sight of the West Indians in
action when the visitors turn out at
North Sydney Oval next Saturday in
a testimonial match for the veteran
scorer and baggage-man Bill Ferguson.
Bill is, of course, looking after the
West Indians on the current tour, his
fifth with West Indian teams. Alto-
gether he has notched up some-
thing over a round three dozen inter-
national tours since he first made the
trip to England with Joe Darling’s
1905 Australian side, and the testi-
monial is an excellent, if long-overdue,
gesture.

The passing years and overseas
experience have tamed the Von’s
temperament, and his real ability is
now showing out.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Sheep on the Coast.
“W.C.Q.”: S. V. B. Sharkey
is raising fat lambs on a 60-acre
property in a 70in. rainfall area
at Mackay on the C.Q. coast.
Starting with 130 animals 18
months ago, Sharkey now has
400 sheep, including 300 ewes.
Lambing has been very satisfac-
tory, almost all the ewes being
capable of feeding their off-
spring. Eighty more Merino
ewes that were mated with Darl-
ing Downs Corriedale rams are
expected to lamb shortly.
Despite the extremely heavy
rains last year and early in 1951
and the dry weather since, all
the sheep have kept in good
health, worms representing no
problem. Some Merino rams.
“Must be calf-love, Mum; she's bin doin' that all day."
in fact, would scale 601 b. or up-
wards, dressed. Merino fleece
from the flock made 19s. Bd. a
pound at the Brisbane sales,
which is very good for coastal-
bred and -reared sheep.
Sharkey swears by molasses as
a drought standby. He says
that the sheep have a great liking
for molasses, and points out that
the sugar syrup has a high
carbohydrate content. Although
he does not say so, it is also
possible the molasses is helping
keep the worms down, since it
acts as a mild vermifuge.
Fattening for Beef.
“Oxo”; Given a slight im-
provement in beef prices and a
system of grading to allow
premiums for quality meat, some
supplementary feeding would be
of great value to the Queensland
cattle industry, according to G.
H. Allen, of the Bureau of
Investigation.
This feeding would be best
applied to cattle which reached
forward store condition on
natural pastures at times when
seasonal conditions would not
fatten them. Supplementary
feeding for eight to ten weeks
would frequently allow cattle to
be sold which would otherwise
have to be held until the next
good season.
Though much is said of corn-
fattening in the U.S.A., of 95
p.c. of the corn grown there fed
to livestock only 8 p.c. is fed to
beef cattle. Pigs take 42 p.c.,
poultry 15 p.c., horses 10 p.c.,
dairy cattle 10 pc. and lambs 1
p.c.
In Queensland the greatest de-
velopment in feeding for beef
production could come from
sorghum grown in the drier
regions, the irrigation areas to
produce lucerne and high-protein
pastures for topping up. Expan-
sion of cotton and linseed crops
would make a little more high-
protein feeds available.
However, corn-fattened cattle
in the U.S.A. bring much higher
prices than could be expected
here. At Chicago in June prime
steers (liveweight 10001 b. to
15001 b.) made the equivalent of
£l3B to £248 a head ; at Cannon
Hill (Q.) recently best young
steers (dressed 4701 b. to 5201 b.)
made £24 to £36 a head. Had
they been corn-fattened that
price would have been a losing
one.
Sidelines Pay.
“Ngaduri”: With the price of
meat sky-high and running only
a little over 300 sheep ourselves,
we decided on an experiment.
Each year previously the wife
has bought 50 month-old pullets.
This year she made it 100 mixed-
sexes ; the cockerels were
separated and allowed to run at
will round fhe farm, but re-
ceived their last feed of whole
grain at night in their little yard
and shed.
Every Saturday, after four
months, one was killed and
another placed in a small fatten-
ing-pen (we had two such pens)
and fed exactly the same ration
as the hens —laying mash, green-
feed, house scraps, meat, etc.
Our weekend joint cost us
2s. Bd. compared with an
equivalent amount of lamb at
from 12s. to 15s.
The important thing is that
previously we had run our hens
on meticulously scientific lines,
feeding them exact rations and
balanced amounts of protein,
vitamins, carbohydrates, etc.
Many died through disease of
various kinds. The only thing
to kill the cockerels was the
axe. So the hens were then
allowed to run at will, and had
a glorious time following the
cows and horses about, climbing
the lucerne-trees and getting
something to eat where there
used to be a haystack four years
ago but was now a mouldy old
grainless heap. Disease dropped
to almost nil: hens were fed
the same rations as before and
left a lot of it, but egg-produc-
tion did not drop ; in fact, it im-
proved slightly, but only over the
lean period, which meant that
their laying season was pro-
longed.
Perhaps we’re wrong ; perhaps
the scientist is right; but our
hens seem to know what they
want themselves, and if they are
allowed to get it for themselves
they are certainly a better pay-
ing proposition than previously.
We don’t pretend to know what
the hens are eating ; but we do
know that a lot of it is stuff
they have never had before and
stuff we had never realised that
hens would eat. From now on
they will always have free access
to the whole farm, and those to
die will be the ones who refuse
to return to the yard at night,
those who lay in the cows’ feed-
boxes and other odd places and
the elusive one which loves
young lettuces.
The Milking Plant.
“Nubis”: Field trials in N.Z.
disclosed serious defects in the
efficiency of most milking-
plants. Less than half the
vacuum gauges tested were
accurate, most readings being
too low. The resultant high
vacuum in operation is likely
to increase the incidence of
mastitis, and lead to other
troubles in milking herds. The
best protection against high
vacuum is a weighted relief
valve fixed at a blow-off vacuum
of between 14in. and 15in. of
mercury. A gauge-testing service
(already begun in W.A.) is an
essential in every dairying
district.
Air - displacement checked
averaged 0.053 cu. ft./sec./set of
cups, against the minimum
figure of 0.06 required for
efficient operation (0.04 for
“double” plants). The remedy
for this lies in a reduction of
leaks and an increase in pump
efficiency or pump speed. Too
low an air - displacement
materially reduces speed of
milking.
Pulsator speeds ranged from
28 to 64 pulsations per minute,
but no difference in milking
efficiency could be detected be-
tween machines working at dif-
ferent rates.
Inflations in many cases were
not changed frequently enough ;
it was considered that they
should be changed at intervals
of six weeks. Light-moulded
inflations could be used longer
if periodically removed and
boiled in a 5 per cent, caustic
solution to remove butterfat and
bacterial contamination.
The main points for testing
the efficiency of a milking-plant
are; vacuum gauges and relief
valves for accuracy, pumps for
efficiency, joints for leaks, and
the setting of pulsators to a
uniform pulsation from bail to
bail.
Grafting.
“Waverly”: Bring the inner
bark tissues (cambium layer) of
both graft and stock into close
contact. The cambium layer is
the slimy film on the inner side
of the bark ; it provides for the
inner expansion of wood-growth
and bark co-relatively. It also
provides an exudation (callus)
for the healing of wounds.
Graft-cutting is usually done
during September and October,
when the grafting-wood is
slightly less forward than the
tree which is to receive it. Trees
to be grafted should have had
their branches cut back during
winter to within 2ft. from the
crotch.
It’s a good idea to divide the
process over two years, dealing
with half one year and half the
following year. October is the
best month to begin, when the
sap is lively and the cambium
layer active.
Rind-grafting is easiest. Best
result is obtained when the cut
surface of the graft tapers nicely
with the flat side of the knife-
cut in the tree. To make sure
that sufficient rising sap is avail-
able, cut an additional 4in. from
the tops of the limbs. Pare the
stump of the graft smoothly
with a sharp knife, and see that
the bark edge is cut to the un-
damaged tissue. Then make a
vertical slit in the bark of the
tree lin. or so shorter than the
tapered end of the graft, making
sure that the position is free of
knots. Lift the edges of the cut
slightly so that the wedge end
of the graft makes entry. Push
down firmly until the whole of
the cut section is in contact with
the sappy face of the wood
beneath the bark. Bind firmly
with adhesive-tape, or, if it is a
big job, long lengths of strong
raffia. These ties can be slit
down with a knife about
December, when the grafts have
taken, and there is then no
danger of strangling the graft.
Safeguard from drying out
either by waxing or by
“pugging” with a clay mixture.
Grafting-wax is easily obtainable
and only requires melting.
“Pug” consists of clean clay,
fresh cow manure, and fine,
chopped hay, with a little water.
Only the lower half of the graft
is encased.
Hinge Lore.
“Grove”: Work on the basis
that the smaller the door the
harder the job, needing greater
care. With cross-battened and
brace-type doors, as used for
outhouses, gates in paling fences
and sheds, etc., use anything
from 4in. to 12in. “T” hinges
according to the weight of the
door. Butt hinges are for small
THE WEATHER
By Inigo Jones
Occurrence of rains in the dry areas —so long awaited
was very close to the time forecast under the theory
developed at Crohamhurst. The rains have been slight y
awry, but under the theory of combined cycles under
immediate sunspot determination this is to be expected.
The great southern sunspot is now advanced to a central
position and should mean further rains about now
(17/10/’5l), with better conditions in the hitherto dry
spell and a continuance of good conditions elsewhere except
in the central interior.

cupboard doors or those on
coops and pens.
With “T” hinges see that each
hinge has a good purchase on
the door. The best position is
over a cross-batten ; the distance
between the hinges will be
dictated by the distance between
cross-battens.
Where the door is particularly
high, or the hinges available are
a little too short for the weight
of the door, necessitating a third
hinge, place this third hinge in
the centre of the door in reverse,
with the top of the “T” screwed
to the door and the tail bent
around the jamb and screwed
down. That part of the hinge
screwed to the jamb is the first
to give when a door is too
heavy.
Butt hinges need counter-
sinking. They should be set as
near to either end of the door
as possible without being any
closer than lin. from the tenon
or joint used in the construction
of the door. Size of the counter-
sinking should be the same as
the length and breadth of the
flange, excluding the centre-pin,
but the depth should be a
fraction less than its thick-
ness. Make a starter-hole, but
avoid totally countersinking the
screws ; the longer they stay put
the better.
A good effect can be given to
small cupboards of sturdier but
plain construction if the door
is set in slightly from the outer
edge of the jamb, but this should
be no more than about l-16in.,
sufficient to give the effect of a
line around the door.
Where the countersinking for
a hinge has been made too deep,
cut a piece of doubled-over fly
gauze, slightly smaller than the
flange, to fit under the hinge
before screwing it on.
Berry Crops.
“Billjim”: Organic manures
generally are of much greater
value to berry fruits than
inorganic fertiliser, although in
some instances a combination of
the two may give even better
results.
Farmyard manure is most
important of the organics. With
attention a farmer owning a
horse, cow or a few head of
poultry can accumulate much
of this valuable material. A ton
of farmyard manure made with
straw litter will contain about
101 b. of nitrogen, 121 b. of
potash, 51b. of phosphoric acid.
All-important is the quantity
and quality of litter used for
bedding domestic animals or
birds. Oat straw is usually
better than wheat straw, and
either is to be preferred to coarse
and more fibrous materials such
as bracken.
Sanded Horses.
“Myrrhee”: If they’ve been
spelling on sandy country they
should be tested for sand
before being put to work. Place
a shovelful of manure in a
bucket, fill with water and stir
until the manure is broken up.
Allow to settle and slowly pour
off, repeating several times until
all the manure has been washed
out. If a dessertspoonful of sand
from one motion remains in the
bucket the horse needs treat-
ment.
Prepare him for this with
three small bran mashes, one
each at morning, midday and
evening. Next day, early, give
a drench of lib. of honey stirred
into one and a half pints of
warmed fresh milk. Feed him
lightly on damped bran and
chaff, then follow with a mixture
made up of 6oz. of sublimated
sulphur, 6oz. of bicarbonate
soda, 3oz. of bitartrate of
potash and l£oz. of powdered
nux vomica. Mix and divide
into 12 powders, giving one in
damped feed morning and even-
ing for six days. On the second
day of the treatment drench with
a pint of liquid paraffin, and to-
wards the end of six days give
him another dose of milk and
honey.
Hints for the Farm.
“Dot”; With a lifetime of I
moving from one place to I
another, I always cemented the!
backyard poultry-run as well as
the coop floor. This allows the
soil to be removed easily and
the floor hosed down periodically j
to ensure freedom from disease. I
The removed soil is rich in
manure and can be used on the I
garden ; poor or sandy soil being
used to replace it. My present!
run is 25ft. long, built against I
the back fence, and Bft. wide. I
The whole area is cemented over I
to a depth of 3in., with a cant!
of about 4in. over the Bft. Even
after heavy storms it drains
quickly.
“Pde.”: When the handle of I
a sledgehammer will not hold!
a wedge try two screws, I
screwed in, not hammered.
‘Sarina”; A dose of sulphate I
of ammonia given to all acid I
fruits when in bearing will
always improve size, quality and I
flavor of the fruit. Best to break
the surface of the ground and
water slowly to wash the I
sprinkled fertiliser to the roots.
Citrus-trees should be fertilised I
every year in high-rainfall areas,
since the heavy rains cause the I
loss of much plant-food.
“W. Court”: Don’t shove a I
lot of manure into the seed-bed I
at the start. It’s enough to I
sprinkle some powdered horse I
manure over after you’ve sown I
the seed and watered the bed. J
Without manure the seedlings j
will make hard growth in the j
bed, and they’ll stand well the
shift into well-manured land, j
Lettuce seedlings in the bed I
must be plentifully watered, but j
cabbages and beet don’t want
too much water until they’re I
safely transplanted.
“M.”; Where bryobia-mite I
(bad in Victorian orchards re-
cently) escape into the summer,
give them two sprays with
HETP, one in 600. The two I
summer sprays are best given at
an interval of 10 to 14 days to
kill mites which hatch out after
the first spray.
“C.A.A.”: Sulphur fungicide
is useful for controlling mildew
on ornamental plants. Use a
combination of lime sulphur and
colloidal sulphur as a spray but
be careful not to get it on the
paint work.

be turned his horse down the
Valley.
Others tried to bargain, but
Joe Purcell was adamant. Two
quid a pig, or nothing; take it
or leave it. All left it. More
than ever was Joe Purcell con-
sidered “close,” and so, more
than ever respected. But there
was gloom over the fact that
Joe Purcell would assuredly feed
his crop of corn to the pigs, and
even, perhaps, turn them on to
that new sweet pasture. As the
months passed none doubted
that the Purcells would succeed
on End Farm, and be the first to
do so. Whatever the opinions
offered it was obvious that the
newcomers were fairly on the
way to prosperity.
A GALE, thereafter known as
The Gale in contradistinc-
tion to all other gales, just as
Noah’s flood must have been
known locally as The Flood,
and not just “a flood,” rushed
into the Valley from the four
corners of the earth, swept the
Valley from north to south,
east to west, earth to sky, tore
at the timbers along Timber
Cliff, toppled the tallest, brought
down deep-rooted trees, and
flung them across the three
roads leading to the corner
milkstand. The rain was too
fierce, too heavy, too flooding
altogether to allow of any work
on the fallen trees. The tele-
phone lines to Brookdale which
might have summoned the
council to do something were
also down, trees across them,
poles down and often smashed,
so that the Valley was virtually
out of communication.
For three days the wind and
rains tore from highlands to
coast, coast to highlands; the
path of its rage was across the
Valley, and all milkstands, in
fact, were laden with un-
collected cans of milk, for no
lorry was able to get through to
get them. Mrs. Isaiah, her lenses
clouded, the family milk curd-
ling on the stand, stood on her
veranda and wept. Miss Arm-
strong alone benefited, for she
had only a few local subscribers
in communication. In between
their anxious inquiries about the
missing milk-lorry she was able
to read a few detective novels.
On the fourth day there were
no cans to hold the milk. Old
milk had been separated, and
the skim poured into drums and
troughs. The few calves each
farmer owned were unable to
cope with the tremendous flow.
Milk-cans gradually filled with
cream, and kerosene-tins and
buckets were requisitioned.
Then, while the wind still
roared through the Valley, the
trees were cleared from the road,
and by dusk telephone com-
munication was restored. Too
late, however, to take the milk
that evening; but normal
collection, the gale permitting,
would be made by the lorry the
next morning.
The next morning revealed
three landslides; one at the
northern entrance to the Valley,
and two about a half-mile
beyond the southern exit from
the Valley. All deliveries were
blocked, but so fierce had the
gale become that few even
cared to take their milk and
cream to the stand. Those who
cared to separate had to throw
their skim on to the pastures,
and the careful souls of the
dairymen were in agony over
this. The landslides had scared
any lorry from coming towards
the Valley for fear of further
slipping of the rain-soaked
mountain sides. A few head of
stock were swirled away by the
raging creek, deep down in the
Valley, but, generally speaking,
the greatest catastrophe was the
wasted separated milk.
Harry thrale it was
who first conceived the idea
of buying up pigs to consume
the waste skim. He said noth-
ing to his neighbors, but rode
in the heavy rain to the Purcell
farm. There he was greeted
warmly by Joe and Mrs. Joe.
In fact, Harry Thrale sus-
pected, there was a gleam of
expectancy in the Purcells’ eyes.
“Wet enough, eh?” Joe
Purcell shouted, in order to be
heard above the roar of the rain
upon his unlined iron roof.
“Wet enough, Joe,” Mr.
Thrale agreed genially, and he
edged towards the huge fire
blazing in the wide iron hearth.
Then Harry Thrale saw that
suspended over the fire was a
small pig, and the smell of it
came sweetly to his nostrils.
“No meat for nearly a week,”
he commented. “Just what
wouldn’t I give for a piece of
that.”
“Just you wait,” promised
Mrs. Joe, “and you can have
your fill.”
Harry Thrale did not even
wince. He waited, and when he
had had his fill felt warm outside
from the fire, and satisfied and
warm within because of the pig.
“Now look here, Joe,” he said.
“I’m after some of those weaners.
Still the same price, eh?”
“Pigs are up,” Joe said. “Rise
of five-bob last sale.”
Harry Thrale winced. He also
looked at Joe with new respect.
“Well, I’ll give you that five-
bob,” he promised.
“You can’t lose,” Joe told him
heartily. “With all that skim
milk you got, and prices rising.”
“Quite,” agreed Harry Thrale
hastily. “As you say, Joe. Now,
can you manage, say, two
dozen?”
“If I was you,” advised Joe
Purcell in a confiding voice,
faintly tinged with mystery, “I’d
be taking two dozen, while they
lasted. They’ll all want them.”
He looked at his neighbor and
winked. “Takes a long time to
shift a landslide,” he said.
Harry Thrale sighed. “Two
dozen it is, Joe,” he said.
“What’s more,” offered Joe,
“I’m still willing to make that
swap.”
“Ha,” said Harry Thrale with-
out much enthusiasm.
“Tryin’ to build a herd up,
I am,” said Joe. “I reckoned if
I could get a few super-dupers
to start me off”
“Joe does so love cows,” said
Mrs. Joe enthusiastically.
“Six, eh?” said Harry sadly.
“I could work you in a brood
sow,” said Joe anxiously.
“That’d give you some weaners
for the blocks, later, and cheap
too.”
“If I did give you some, that
is, swap some,” said Harry
Thrale with slight pain on his
face, “you wouldn’t sell them on
me, eh?”
“Sell them?” said Mrs. Joe,
shocked.
“Your calves?” said Joe rever-
ently. “No, no, Harry, not me.”
“When we look across and see
your Ayrshires,” said Mrs.
Purcell, “we reckon we’ll never
be happy until we have a good
herd of them. But that isn’t
easy, is it? Of course that’d be
when we’d made enough out of
the pigs to start properly.”
“And then there’s the timber,”
said Joe with some pride.
“Good lot of timber we’ve sold
there.”
“Six it is,” said Harry Thrale.
He was slightly sleepy now. A
feed of pork made you that way,
especially with a warm fire. He
scarcely thought about the
calves.
“I’ve got a nice piece of
pasture for them,” said Joe,
rubbing his hands ; “as nice a
piece as ever you laid eyes on.”
“You can’t get a truck along
the road, Joe,” said Harry
Thrale, suddenly remembering.
“Now haven’t you ever seen
pigs drove?” Joe asked him.
Whereupon the bargain was
sealed.
Harry thrale’s two
dozen scarcely touched the
weaners and porkers, baconers
and slips which were in demand
by the farmers in the Valley.
Old sows went too, sows in pig,
sows out of pig, sows
about to farrow, and sows
too young to farrow ; but they
were all bargains with so much
unconsumed milk mounting in
every farm. The curious fact
was that each and every farmer
was grateful to Joe, prices and
all. It was a delight to watch
waste milk being guzzled by
hungry fattening pigs. It took
the terror from landslides. Joe
merely claimed a half-dozen of
the choicest sow, and his pet
boar, so that he might begin
again. He pointed out carefully,
to each customer, that his prices
were fair-and-all, considering,
and each customer agreed.
Some, like Mr. Thrale, were
willing to part, barter fashion,
with a selected calf, or even a
young and springing heifer.
So none cared very much,
when The Gale had abated,
trees had been chopped through,
and landslides cleared away,
that Joe Purcell was on the
road to prosperity. Certainly
none begrudged him that. His
children still came to school on
the one horse, but folk had long
ago forgotten the strangeness of
that. They thought it was a very
good thing that the hill was
cleared of its timber, the
pastures of brush and bracken,
and that the End Farm could
run cows with the next, and add,
daily, its valuable contribution
to the corner milkstand. That
in its own way was a certificate
of Joe’s worth in the com-
munity. And in return for a
valuable lesson taught—that no
farm can afford to be without
its pig or two, whole milk not-
withstanding —the Valley at its
very next meeting elected Joe a
Vice-President of the Parents’
and Citizens’ Association,
although it was known that,
there being three other vice-
presidents, Joe need never worry,
really, about having to take the
chair.

Achievements of an Industry, No. 3,
“MONASTRAL BLUE”
“Monastral” Fast Blue B is the most brilliant of all blue organic
pigments. Though one of the major chemical achievements of recent
years, the observations which led to its discovery were accidental.
In 1928, chemists at an 1.C.1. works in Scotland noticed a blue
impurity in some phthalimide, a chemical used in making dyestuffs.
The origin of this impurity was found to be a crack in the lining of
an iron vessel where a reaction with the iron was producing a blue
substance.
This chance defect stimulated the curiosity of the chemists. By a
complicated piece of chemical research the impurity was found to
belong to an entirely new class of compounds—the phthalocyanines—
whose structure resembles chlorophyll, the green pigment of plants
and haemin —the red colouring matter in blood. After hundreds of
tests on a wide variety of phthalocyanine derivatives, copper
phthalocyanine was shown to have great commercial possibilities.
The new pigment was finally produced in 1936, and today
“Monastral” Fast Blue B is widely used in colouring plastics, paints,
paper and printing inks. It is the first new blue paint in the artists’
paint box for a hundred years.

A few particulars about Gerard
Manley Hopkins, the English poet ?
Born in 1844, he was educated at
Balliol College, Oxford, and in 1866
entered the Roman Catholic church,
and became a Jesuit preacher. In
1884 he was appointed to the chair
of Greek at Dublin University. He died
in 1889. None of his poetry was
published during his lifetime, and it
was not till nearly 30 years later, in
1918, that his friend, poet Robert
Bridges, brought out a single volume
that contains all his poetry. Hopkins
is regarded by most critics as a major
poet, but it seems unlikely that he
will ever be very widely read (only
1000 copies of the 1918 edition of his
poetry were sold in 12 years). Still,
he was a pbet of great originality,
and was a skilful innovator in rhythm.
He is noted in particular for his
compound word-creations “lovely-
asunder starlight,” “O feel-of-
primrose hands,” “fresh-firecoal
chestnut-falls.”

Is Tommy Burns the only prominent
Australian boxer to make a successful
comeback ? How long ago was it
that Burns had his last fight before
beating Mickey Tollis?
Tommy Burns is not the only
prominent Australian boxer to make
a successful comeback, as Bert Spargo
retired in 1917 and returned to the
ring in 1920. From then until late
in 1925 Spargo had 59 fights, for 41
wins, 15 losses and three draws.
Burns’s last fight before beating Tollis
on October 2, 1951, was when Kev
Delaney outpointed him (15 rounds)
for the Australian welterweight
championship on July 11, 1949.

Some information on the Suez
Canal ?
The canal js cut through the isthmus
of Suez, and connects the Red Sea
and the Mediterranean. Its length is
101 miles, 21 miles of which are
through lakes. Another canal links
the Nile to it. In 1854 Ferdinand
de Lesseps, a French engineer, formed
a company to cut the canal. (The
company is registered in Egypt, with
head office in Paris; the British
Government holds nearly half the
shares.) The management of the
canal is entrusted to a council of 32
administrators, 10 of whom are
British. By a convention of 1888,
the canal is exempted from blockade,
and vessels of all nations, armed or
not, can pass through it in peace or
war. Average time of transit is 11
hours. In 1948, latest figures avail-
able, 8686 vessels of a net tonnage
of 55,000,000 passed through. The
canal is continually being improved,
and has several times been widened
and deepened. By agreement between
the Egyptian Government and the com-
pany, Egypt is to come into full
possession in 1968; but some hot-
heads on the Nile are demanding
instant control.

Method of preparing and canning
passionfruit pulp?
The fruit should be ripe, full-

from the rind and then in every
101 b. extracted pulp dissolve £lb.
best crystallised cane sugar. Fill into
lacquered cans not holding more than
13oz. to within £in. of top and
solder down the lid. Exhaust for five
minutes in a water bath at 190 deg. F„

cans fully submerged in water at
190 deg. F. for 20 minutes.

Did Leigh Hunt or Keats write the
poem “The Grasshopper and the
Cricket” ?
Both wrote sonnets on that theme,
though Keats’s is probably better
known. Keats’s sonnet was written
at Leigh Hunt’s cottage in response
to a challenge from Hunt, and the
two sonnets were subsequently printed
together in the “Examiner.” Keats’s
sonnet “On a Grasshopper and a
Cricket” begins:
The poetry of earth is never dead:
When all the birds are faint with the
hot sun.
And hide in cooling trees, a voice will
run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown
mead.
And Hunt’s “To the Grasshopper and
the Cricket” begins:
Green little vaniter in the sunny grass
Catching your heart up at the feel of
June,
Sole voice that’s heard amidst the lazy
noon,
Where ev’n the bees lag at the summoning
brass.

What is the cause of sleepwalking ?
Sleepwalking is one of the neuroses
of deep sleep, really an acted dream.
The exciting causes are usually mental
excitement, overwork, bodily fatigue
or digestive disorders; it is met with
chiefly in persons of nervous tempera-
ment or those who have an inherited
proclivity to neurotic disease; nobody
who is in perfect health walks in his
sleep. An important point is that a
sleepwalker found wandering should
not be roughly awakened, but led
back to bed as gently as possible.

How can the sex of the galah parrot
be ascertained; also the sex of the
white corella parrot ?
In the male galah the iris of the
eye is black in color, while in the
female the iris is more-or-less hazel
or reddish in color. The general
plumage is the same in both sexes,
but the female is slightly more slender
than the male in build. Both sexes
of corellas have similar plumage, but
the female bird is slightly smaller in
build and the beak is a little
narrower.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Recruiting
It seems a pity that so much of the
official recruiting advertisements for the
armed services should stress the amenities
of service life rather than appeal to
the spirit of patriotism and adventure.
For centuries recruiting campaigns have
been conducted by appealing to the
emotions rather than the pocket. The
scarlet-uniformed recruiting sergeant of
other days, with his file of drummers, was
capable of luring reluctant recruits from
the depths of public-houses and from be-
hind the safe counters of shops. And that
at a time when the British Army was not
noted for its amenities, and when a serving
soldier could expect the cat if he mis-
behaved.
Modern advertising has taken the place
of the sergeant and his drummers, but
the principle should be the same—a direct
appeal that will make men proud to
enlist.
There could be no better way of getting
directly to young Australians than through
the deeds of their fellow-countrymen in
the last two wars. Few youngsters today
have even heard of many famous 1914-18
actions. Gallipoli is well enough known,
perhaps, but what of Fromelles, Bulle-
court and Third Ypres?
Even the battles and campaigns of the
last war are fading from the memory of
all except those who took part in them.
It has always seemed a pity to me that
the nation’s only war museum should be
at Canberra, where it is visited by only
a small proportion of the very people to
whom it should convey a message of
past achievement and sacrifice, and in
whom it would engender an interest in
the history of Australian fighting men.
Maybe the exhibits are safe there, but
they might as well be buried in the Sahara
as far as the youngsters of Redfern,
Fitzroy and the bush are concerned —and
they are the ones who will have to carry
on the traditions of the men of T 4 and
’39.
Most prospective recruits earn more in
civil life than they can be offered in
recruiting appeals, and as for ameni-
ties, the sky’s the limit with em-
ployers these days. But tell them the
story of Bardja, or Bullecourt, or Jutland,
and you strike the spark that has led men
to the defence of their countries for
centuries. — Dick Turpin (N.S.W.).
A.B.C. News
Tell “Waddlin’ Willie” (B. 22/8/’5l) I
have a good short-wave set, complete
with aerial, and know how to tune it.
A.B.C. national news is a good session,
and, as he says, comes up to world
standard for a 10-minute bulletin. We
pick it up clearly here several times a
day.
What we want here is Australian news,
not world news. The A.B.C. national
news is about 25 per cent. Australian
news and 75 per cent, overseas news. The
latter we have already heard several hours
previously on the 8.8. C. and Radio
Malaya (Singapore). I have taken par-
ticular note, and practically every item of
overseas news in A.B.C. national news is
identical with, and obviously copied word
for word from, the 8.8. C. news, heard
here hours previously.
It is waste of time and money Aus-
tralia trying to provide a “world news”
session for Eastern listeners. They are
always hours behind 8.8. C., All-India
Radio, Radio Malaya, The Voice of
America, to mention just a few which
can be picked up clearly here and are not
heard in Australia. All radios here are
adapted for short-wave reception as well
as local.
If an Australian news session is to be
provided for Eastern listeners, be it
A.B.C. or Radio Australia, let it be real
news and not the type of stuff complained
of in B. 8/8/’5l. —Orang Puteh (Siam).
“Culpable Driving’*
The jibe at N. S. Wales Attorney-
General Martin (B. 3/10/’5l) was ill-
directed. There is good reason for the
amendments to the Crimes Act to provide
a “culpable-driving” charge instead of
manslaughter against a motorist respon-
sible for a road fatality.
The reason is that practically all
motorists accused of manslaughter are
found not guilty because the Crown has
to prove mens rea, or that a motorist
had the intention of knocking a pedestrian
down. It is singularly difficult to con-
vince a jury that a motorist has this end
in view when he does, because of his
negligence, kill someone. Under the new
amendment a motorist who, because of
negligence, is involved in a road fatality
will now have to face the music.
The culpable-driving charge will also
replace the charge of criminal negligence
in motor accidents where a victim is
injured. Some time ago I served on a jury
in connection with a case where a
motorist was charged with criminal negli-
gence for having crossed the continuous
yellow line just below the crest of a hill
and, in doing so, collided with another
vehicle, seriously injuring its driver. As
a motorist myself—and regarding all
crossers of continuous yellow lines and
shooters-through of red traffic-lights and
“Halt” signs as potential murderers—l
was convinced that the accused was guilty
even before his barrister presented his
case. During the adjournment for lunch
all members of the jury (of whom eight
were motorists) were of the opinion that
the accused was guilty.
When, however, the accused’s barrister
stated that we could only find his client
guilty if we were convinced that he had
deliberately crossed the continuous yellow
line with the intention of colliding with
a vehicle on its own side coming in the
opposite direction, we were compelled to
change our minds. The judge in his
summing-up emphasised that view.
Within a matter of seconds in the jury-
room we had to find the accused not
guilty—we sat yarning in the jury-room
for half an hour or so to keep him in
suspense as some measure of punishment.
Under the Crimes Act in future such
a motorist will have to suffer punishment
for his crime, instead of just having to
pay legal expenses. I am no protagonist
of Mr. Martin, but I think he deserves
some credit for the amendments to the
Crimes Act he has introduced, and I am
sure that the vast majority of motorists
and pedestrians will agree with me. —
Tidak Makan (N.S.W.).
Wool Prices
Agree with “Graz” (B. 3/10/’5l) that
one of the healthiest things that could
happen would be for wool prices to
stabilise at the September levels.
Figures just released on the production
of rayon, cotton, wool and silk,
combined, for 1950 show a decline to
18,227,000,0001 b., a decrease of six per
cent, on the previous year. N.S.W. pro-
duction of greasy wool for the same
period is down 23,000,0001 b. to
492,130,0001 b., with a drop of 0.21 b. in
the average clip to 8.61 b.
Joint Organisation, now completed, will
no longer contribute anything to the
market, and there is general world stock-
piling for defence to be considered. Unless
there is an exceptional increase in pro-
duction, high prices for wool seem the
only outcome. Synthetics may fill some
of the gap, but millions of wonderful
imitation diamonds have been made with
little effect on the demand for diamonds.
Apart from the high shearing-rates and
the increased costs of woolpacks, netting,
fencing, etc., which “Graz” mentions,
the new rail-freight increase of 75 per
cent, for the transportation of wool, to
take effect from October 22, will hit
growers The man in the country seems
to have been made to bear the brunt
of the deficit in railway accounts.
Practically everything travelling to or
from the country has been made the
subject of a discriminative impost.
Seemingly, just to ensure the increased
freights do not create an additional drift
to the city, country train travel has been
bumped up 10 per cent. also. African
(N.S.W.).
Migrants
It is regrettable that the Federal Gov-
eminent has changed its migration policy
to embrace only single British migrants,
Experience in hostels has proved that
married persons are the best workers and
settle in more easily.
Habits and morals are on a higher
standard among the married, fewer of
whom, also, have any wish to return to
Britain. Many single men and women
are quick to copy the bad points of our
workers, and a large number have proved
that they are, in fact, just tourists. Those
disadvantages far outweigh the advantages
of housing for single migrants being
more readily provided.—Plain Aus-
trai TAN (Vic)
TRALiAN tv IC.;.
The Property Market
The fact that 27 properties were passed-
in for sale by private treaty at a Sydney
auction created a mild panic among
property-owners who appeared to think
that the bottom had fallen out of the
market at last. Actually something of
the sort has happened on a number of
occasions, but the Press had not caught
up with the story.
There is nothing wrong with the
property market —nor with the demand
for houses, flats, tents, cabins, garages
or any other type of dwelling. With an
annual demand in N. S. Wales standing
at something like 36,000 to 40,000 dwel-
lings and an annual output of about
25,000 —including the product of Gov-
ernment enterprise in its varied forms —
the difference must be satisfied from the
volume of “old” property coming on the
market.
A major factor in such slowing-up as
there has lately been of property sales
has been the greed of some vendors who
have refused to be guided by estate-
agents as to reserve prices. A study of
sales of comparable property in a district
and the exercise of a little thought and
judgment should indicate to buyer and
seller alike what is a reasonable value.
The effect of the passing-in at auction of
a property is, usually, that the vendor
accepts the advice of his agent as to the
market-price and treats privately. In
most instances sales are effected to the
satisfaction of both parties.
Another factor in slackening-off of
sales has been the drying-up of sources of
finance. Building societies, banks, insur-
ance companies, etc., have, during the
past few months, been unable to meet the
demand for finance, and, as a result,
many intending purchasers of new
property have been prevented from buy-
ing and builders have been forced to
curtail their operations.
That may well prove to be a good thing
because it will indicate to builders that
their slap-happy approach to contracts
and construction costs is due for a
change. High building costs could be
pruned to a considerable extent by closer
supervision by builders and the refusal
of buyers to sign contracts on any but a
firm basis. Financial institutions could
insist on stricter costing of jobs as a
condition of loan. Proper organisation
by builders of their "on site operations
would eliminate much wasteful expen-
diture of materials and labor. — JindivicK
(N.S.W.).
Second-class Air-travel
Australian airline companies, always
keen to outdo one another, should try
second-class air-travel as a bid to boost
the number of passengers carried, and to
extend the advantages of air-travel to
people who can’t afford to fly at present.
Right now the companies are fighting
each other tooth and nail, offering more
service to get more custom. But there’s
nothing for nothing, and all these little
extras cost money, as evidenced by the
always-increasing fares.
Second-class air-travel could be intro-
duced in Australia by abolishing air-
hostesses, meals on board, lollies and
papers, and by banning excess luggage
and providing more seating accom-
modation.
On long-distance trips second-class
passengers could easily obtain their meals
on the ground when the aircraft refuels.
They would be interested only in getting
to their destination without any of these
luxuries which seem to have become part
of flying today.
The International Air Transport
Association meeting in London has dis-
cussed the possibility of second-class air-
travel, and was told that it would be given
a trial across the Atlantic early in the
new year.
Australia has been well to the fore in
civil aviation for the last three decades ;
there’s no reason why it should not stay
there by introducing second-class air-
travel immediately.— P/o Prune (Vic.).
Economy
I note with alarm Minister Casey’s
announcement as to how he proposes to
economise in his C.5.1.R.0. Apparently
the C.5.1.R.0. is to be allowed an in-
crease of 15 per cent, over last year’s
expenditure, that being considered an
economy because it represents a reduc-
tion of 10 per cent, in the amount of
money hoped for. — Taxpayer (N.S.W.).
Migrant Complaints
Australia has been a grand host to
thousands of post-war migrants, but a
handful of migrants, who are outspoken,
are doing their best to make things hard
and to get adverse criticism in overseas
papers. To a certain extent they are
succeeding.
Although the element responsible for
the frequent outspoken attacks on hostel
conditions is only a small percentage of
the migrants in Australia, the newspapers
are falling for their stories and giving
them a great run.
Lately the disgruntled bunch of
migrants in hostels around Melbourne
appealed to a well-known union for
support in their campaign against the
Australian Government. The union was
only too ready to assist. It provided
rooms rent-free and instructed one of its
own organisers to act as “liaison” with
the migrants. With the union machinery
behind them these migrants went on with
their campaign regularly making critical
statements in the Press which in turn
were cabled overseas.
Unknown to the officers in charge of
the hostel or the migrants themselves, a
responsible Melbourne journalist visited
several of the hostels unannounced and,
for some time, unnoticed. His two
articles in a Melbourne daily showed the
migrants to be well-fed and -housed,
while their few minor complaints, in-
cluding lack of public telephones, c °uld
have been rectified if they had approached
the hostel management themselves. The
articles have killed that particular
criticism.
But within a week after the first batch
of Melbourne’s new tram migrants were
housed in a suburban Tramways Board
hostel they were making the headlines
threatening to resign unless their tood
improved. They approached the Com-
munist secretary of their union, who was
soon out with them urging them to take
“positive action,” Their mam complaint
was that they were getting dagwood
sandwiches for their cut lunches and the
bread was stale. Next day a journalist
went out to their hostel and wrote an
article telling the migrants they were far
better off than most other people and
offering to swap places. They, too, have
been silent since. But unfortunately their
first criticism made the headlines not
only here but in England, where a
mission is at present doing its utmost to
get urgently needed staff. t ~
The dailies would be doing Australia
a great service by first analysing the re-
nort from these few disgruntled migrant
before splashing their complaints across
the front page. We need migran
urgently, and bad unfounded cnticisffl
abroad won’t help us get them.

detail. Altogether, except that it has not
Lawson Glassop’s humor, his warmth of
Australian feeling nor his admirable
political detachment, it is rather like a
cruder version of We Were the Rats.
The Twenty Thousand Thieves is
described on the jacket, ignoring We
Were the Rats, as “the first novel dealing
with the Diggers who won these great
victories”: which, seeing that the opening
chapter of Mr. Lambert’s Book 2 is a
time-switch giving a preview of Tobruk,
remarkably like the preview of Tobruk
which was used for the opening chapter
of We Were the Rats, will hardly be
approved by anybody who rates Lawson
Glassop’s fine contribution to Australian
literature at its proper worth.
We Were the Rats, of course, was
banned in New South Wales, largely on
the evidence of a policeman who didn’t
know Shakspeare’s Christian name, had
never heard of Shelley and thought Byron
might be on Lord Mountbatten’s staff:
a proceeding which really seems too
absurd when you learn that Mr. Lambert’s
propagandist tract, in the course of which
Mr. Menzies is described as “nro-Hitler,”
was written on a grant of £4OO from the
Commonwealth Fund, approved by J. B.
Chifley, Sir Arthur Fadden and Mr.
Menzies.

Gregory’s Street Directory of Sydney
and Suburbs (Gregory): The rapid
development of the outer suburbs of
Sydney is indicated in this new-the 18th
—edition, which contains many hundreds
of new street-names) in addition to
numerous name-changes. The maps have
been completely revised to brings them
up-to-date and the edition has been other-
wise improved and enlarged. It is an
invaluable guide for anyone wanting to
find his way about the sprawling
metropolis with its more than 20,000
streets and roads.

The Other Side of the Sun . Paul Capon
(Heinemann). The science correspondent
ot a British daily learns of the theory of
an extinct German professor that a
planet similar to the earth followed in
the earth’s orbit, invisibly to the earth,
behind the sun. A space-ship is fitted
out and makes the journey, with the
science correspondent’s daughter among
the crew, and her boy-friend, who has
helped finance the expedition from a huge
win in a football-pool lottery. They
arrive on the new planet and observe the
inhabitants, and for a very special reason
the two lovers decide not to return. The
space-ship starts on its way back to
earth ; there is a loud explosion and the
book ends. The author has made some
effort to describe life on a space-ship ;
and his scientific explanations have this
advantage—that no one, as yet, can chal-
lenge them.

The Circle of the Minotaur: Stuart
Hood (Routledge and Kegan Paul).' Two
novelettes. The longer, the title-piece,
shows an Italian anti-Fascist returning to
his village after the end of World War 11.
He has fought with the Republicans in
Spain and the Resistance in France, and
now hopes to make his peace with the
cousin of the village Fascist he was
accused of murdering, and whose murdei
was the cause of his leaving Italy. The
author was a p.-0.-w. in Italy, and the
Italian countryside loses no lushness from
his green fingers, while the Italian men
and girls come vividly alive. The other
story, “The Fisherman’s Daughter,” is
set on another frontier—Mr. Hood was
later with 21 Army Group in north-west
Europe.

Lord Johnnie: Leslie T. White (Shak-
speare Head). About to be hanged,
“Lord Johnnie,” leader of London’s
ciooks in the middle 1700’s, marries
young Lady Somerset, a device by which
she could escape imprisonment for debt
But he is rescued from the gallows, and
that night, ignoring the broken-nosed
Moll, whose charms are lavishly displayed
to the reader, he forces himself upon the
amazed Lady Somerset and insists, all
right and proper, upon his conjugal rights
-—lavishly displayed to the reader. But
the jilted Moll betrays him to a Press-
gang, and he goes to sea, heads a mutiny,
and runs the ship across to America
where he struts about and meets, strangely
enough, Lady Somerset again. But he is
denounced, and things look pretty black
for him when someone recognises him as
the illegitimate son of a noble lord; so
that explains everything.

Silent Night Holy Night E. L. Politzer
(Pan Press; Box Q 1761, G.P.0., Mel-
bourne). A pleasant little book giving a
brief account (with words and music) of
the origin of the well-known Christmas
carol, the words of which were composed
in 1818 by Josef Mohr, Vicar of Obern-
dorf in Austria, and the music by his
friend the schoolteacher, Franz Gruber.
The St. Nicholas church in Oberndorf,
where the carol was first sung, was
destroyed about the end of the century
by floods in the Salzach, the wild
mountain stream beside which it was
built.

Turkish Crossroads: Bernard Newman
(Hale). Part travel, part history, part
politics; a quiet, readable and informa-
tive book leading to the conclusion,
“Turkey is easily the most stable country
in the Middle East. Hitherto the
Russians have adopted an aggressive tone
in their dealings with Turkey: yet they
are capable of rapid and complete
reversals of policy—as in their outlook
on Hitler in 1939. Yet I doubt if a subtle
policy of flattery and political wooing
would succeed with Turkey. The Turks
have seen the Russians at close quarters
for many centuries and do not believe
that ideologies vitally affect national
characteristics.”
* * * *
Sweet Cork of Thee: Robert Gibbings
(Dent). Mr. Gibbings’s travel-books are
always pleasant to come upon these days,
for they are closer to literature than to
journalism, more concerned with people
than with politics, based in humor rather
than ideas ; and there is always, besides
his celebrated wood-engravings, a nice bit
of fishing thrown in. This one is a
continuation of Lovely Is the Lee, and
wanders into the Cork and Kerry
countryside to deal with ancient legends
and modern poaching and the like, and to
show that the Irish can still talk as they
did in Synge—“ The health is not very
well with me,” said old Patsy Corcoran,
“but that’s the way the world goes—-the
young ones be rising and the old ones
be falling. And hither and over, east or
west, north or south, each one must
hammer out his own road.”
* * * *
I Married a Dinosaur: Lilian Brown
(Harrap). Mrs. Brown’s husband hunts
for the bones of prehistoric animals
around India and Burma and Mrs. Brown
writes lightly and brightly about whal
goes on ; Burmese boys being tattooed in
their initiation ceremonies, Americans
talking about Texas at Burmese oil-wells,
Indian women washing their clothes in
the rivers, and Mr. Brown finding a new
species of mouse (subsequently named
after him) in a snake’s stomach and, pro-
trading from a hillside, “the beautiful
leg of a prehistoric land-turtle Colosso «-
chelys atlas, from which the Hindus got
their myth that the world rides through
space on a turtle s back.
* * * *
Danger Spot of Europe : A 1 a n
Houghton Brodrick (Hutchinson). Mr.
Brodnck visited West Germany (not for
the first time) in 1950 and gives an un-
usually clear and comprehensive picture
of the state of the country. There is a
brief survey of contemporary German
literature, mentioning the exiles such as
Thomas Mann, Herman Hesse and
Alfred Doblin, a few .surviving local
writers such as Plievier (the author of
Stalingrad, living in retirement in South
Germany) and Heidegger (the Existen-
tialist, lurking in the Black Forest”),
with the general conclusion, “German
literature, which declined all through the
brash vulgarity of the Second Reich,
which perked up a little during the
Weimar Republic only to fade away
under the blast of the Nazis, is now so
feeble as to have hardly any existence ”
There are also odd bits of information
such as the fact that until 1950 no Ger-
mans were allowed arms, even shotguns
so that “the deer and wild pig increased
greatly. Any Sunday afternoon you could
hardly count the number of hairy pig
carcasses slung over the bonnets of the
American cars on the roads.” But the
principal theme is, of course, what the
West Germans think of the Americans
and the British, what the East Germans
think of the Russians, and what may be
going to happen. Mr. Brodrick puts the
West Germans with the Japanese as
“concerned with two aims only: keeping
out of another war altogether, or, next
best thing, being quite sure that if they
have to fight it is on the winning side.”
Purges, terror, the “indoctrination” of
the young and the natural sympathy
between the Nazi and Communist
tyrannies (“Among the most ardent of
the ‘intellectual’ Stalinists are, of course,
the ex-Nazis”) seem to have made the
East Germans, for the time being, simply
another Soviet satellite, with “the popula-
tion as a whole passive and resigned”
and “the unemployed West Berliner re-
ceiving a dole higher than the full wages
of an East Berliner.”
