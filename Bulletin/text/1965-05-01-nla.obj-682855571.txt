Even if you wanted a machine to operate
constantly at a temperature as high as 482 °F:
‘FLUON’ PARTS
WOULD FUNCTION PERFECTLY
('Fluon' —The I C I brand of p.t.f.e.)
‘Fluon’ is an extraordinary material with a wide
range of applications. Perhaps ‘Fluon’s’ most
unusual feature is its perfect operation in ex-
tremes of temperature—from as high as 482°F
down to liquid nitrogen temperature.
And ‘Fluon’ is virtually indestructible by known
corrosive chemicals—that’s why it’s the ideal
material for use in bearings, bushes, gaskets,
diaphragms and a multitude of other uses.
So, if yours is a friction or temperature prob-
lem, put ‘Fluon’ to work for you.

On the Cutting-Room Floor
'T'he reason for the rather unusual
soiree was a bit vague, but with
censorship continuing to be a lively and
confused topic we weren't entirely sur-
prised when the Commonwealth Film
Censorship Board invited us to have a
look at their collection of dirty pictures.
Chief Censor Mr Dick Prowse had
passed out invitations to the Sydney
Press for a late-afternoon gathering at
the Board’s offices in Bligh Street
seven floors above a surgical instrument
wholesaler’s display rooms and hard by
the Savoy Theatre which frequently
shows the sort of Continental movies we
imagine must call for the Board’s
scrutiny.
About a dozen male journalists re-
sponded to the invitation. The “Daily
Telegraph” described them as “hardened
newspapermen”; the “Sydney Morning
Herald” called them “a specially selected
audience of mature, experienced journal-
ists’’. They all looked pleased with their
assignment, but we can assure the public
that they not missing much.
Mr Prowse said the Customs Minister,
Senator K. Anderson, had agreed with
him that the Board should meet the
Press to make known the nature of film
censorship in Australia. Prowse thought
the best way of doing this was not by
making a speech but by showing a short
“programme” of representative cuts
made from imported movies and of films
seized by Customs men in the last couple
of years. “You will see,” he said, “that
brutality, sadism and violence gives us
more of a problem than sex.” From our
view of the first 20-minute reel of
scissored snippets from 15 or 16 different
movies we should say that sex was still
pretty much of a problem for Mr Prowse
and his examiners.
The censored sex was in predictable
forms: the bared breasts of a woman
in a G-string caressing musical instru-
ments in a technicolored sequence from
what looked like one of those “World
By Night” films; stripteasers jerking their
bodies orgasmically; a string of bedroom
scenes of women undressing. Then there
was a phantasmagoria of stranglings, ice-
pick stabbings, floggings (of both the
bestial and masochistic types), impalings
and an assortment of Biblical epic
brutalities. There was also a heavily
labored double rape of a young woman
in a sequence which suggested an Ingmar
Bergman film.
Next to an adjoining room for the
screening of a short 8 m.m. stag him
(of a couple of naked cuties throwing
a beach ball around), and then back to
the main room for the unadulterated
pornography. This was a copy of a copy
of a copy of an old sepia-tinted French
film which Customs had seized from an
incoming traveller, who was fined. Ihe
film contained pretty much the whole
range of pornographic sex play and
scenes of homosexual,ty. lesb.an.sm, etc.,
we f, enac e '
Afterwards, over a few glasses of
scotch, Dick Prowse said that the
Board’s four male and three female mem-
bers between them had inspected almost
20 million feet of imported film in the
last year and had censored 1105 feet.
Between them they looked at every
theatre movie and TV film which came
into the country. This didn’t seem to
leave them much of an original selection
for their leisure hours. Did they, for
instance, look at" Mavis Bramston? “Oh,
yes,” said one Board man, “we watch
that. But only to see what they can get
away with.”
Rif e Imitates Art \
Life imitate Art in the case of
” the Australian edition of “The
Trial of Lady Chatterley”, which is still
deservedly selling like hot cakes?
The technique of evading Customs
jurisdiction by printing a banned book
here is not altogether new (in the early
p ar t 0 £ cen^ur y Coles Book Arcade
did w banned “The Awful
Disclosures of Maria Monk”, and in
1950 Protestant Publications, Sydney,
with Pastor Chiniquy’s banned “The
Priest, the Woman and the Confes-
sional”) and a little-known novel has
even been written about this technique,

“Polluted Inheritance”, a story of a

We’d be making more profit if we’d
insulated the roof with Fibreglass
Why Fibreglass? Because Fibre-
glass is the best cost/performance
insulation in the world.
Fibreglass saves capital costs, saves
operating costs, and needs no maintenance.
Fibreglass saves an extra 6% on heat
loss compared with the same thickness of
any similar insulation material.
Fibreglass gives greater efficiency with
less weight, saving roof construction cost.
Fibreglass saves on heating and cooling
equipment because its greater efficiency
allows the use of smaller units in heating
and cooling systems.
And you save on maintenance because
Fibreglass won’t warp, rot, shrink or sag.
It is non-corrosive, mould-proof, moisture
resistant and will not burn. Fibreglass
lasts forever and never loses its insulation
value.
Fibreglass Wool Insulation is made in
several forms to meet every need of the
architect , engineer or property owner

Sumner is 15, his mother, who has been
nothing but a sexual animal all her
life, enters into an incestuous relation-
ship with him.
A young woman, Miss Penny Hewart,
persuades a Melbourne bookseller to
import the book and from this she decides
to print an Australian edition. To escape
the beady eyes of the Customs she hid
the more sordid parts of the book in the
lining of her corset.
The attention of Customs is caught
when her publishing firm, The Banner
Press, inserts advertisements in the Mel-
bourne papers: “As good almost kill
a man as kill a good book; who kills a
man kills a reasonable creature, God’s
image; but he who destroys a good book
kills reason itself, kills the image of God
as it were in the eye—Milton.”
A young Customs officer who befriends
Miss Hewart warns her of a raid on her
flat and she places jackets of the banned
book around some of Shakespeare’s
works. These are taken by two Customs
officers.
She turned the situation by writing
a nasty letter to Customs suggesting that
if the works of Shakespeare had been
declared a prohibited import, a psychia-
trist should be called in. After being
threatened with legal action, Customs as-
sure her that no further action will be
taken.
But the matter finally comes to court
after Customs is pressurised by the pre-
sident of the League for Suppression of
Vice, Mr Eustace Snodcombe. The case,
however, is won for The Banner Press
when a professor of Classical Philology
likens the book to the old Greek myth
of Creation. Subsequently the jury found
“Polluted Inheritance” not obscene and
Miss Hewart not guilty of publishing an
obscene libel.
Blasphemy in Melbourne
A/Telbourne’s beer strike ended ex-
A ceedingly abruptly, presumably so
that neither workers nor Melburnians
would be inconvenienced over the Easter
holidays. The men were claiming a
weekly rise of £4 10s. at the Carlton-
United Brewery plants and eventually
they were brought together with their
employers in a compulsory conference.
But the intriguing thing was the utterly
Trappist attitude of the monastery at
the top end of Swanston St. To all
inquiries the answer was “no comment”.
Indeed there were occasions when we
wondered whether the managing direc-
tor of the monastery, Mr R. F. G.
Fogarty, did really exist.
He existed all right. The Bulletin
contacted a well-known beer importer
and asked when he was bringing in giant
supplies from interstate. “I won’t,” was
the answer. “RFG will expect all brewers
to stand together at a time like this and
they won’t sell interstate.” Togetherness,
you see.
But other people, including many a
city club went the round-about-way and
bought supplies retail, in Adelaide,
Hobart and Sydney. However, with the
abrupt end to the strike, hotels, caterers
and such were landed with supplies of
this expensive interstate canned beer.
At the first match on St Kilda’s new
home at Moorabbin, what was on sale
everywhere but Sydney beer at 3/- a
can! The price was bad enough, but
even more horrifying was the fact that
almost every can carried a picture of the
Sydney Cricket Ground. So all after-
noon color pictures of the citadel of
Rugby League made music down the
concrete steps of the newest and most
handsome Australian Rules grandstand.
Correcting English
gap between research and prac-
tice is not always wide. Following
a recent survey of the comprehension
and expression abilities 'in English of
first-year students, the Australian
National University is employing, in its
Department of Adult Education, six
tutors to conduct remedial classes
throughout the first and second terms
this year for more than 30 per cent
of first-year students.
They will teach 279 students who
failed the test and some others, by
request — how to construct an essay,
and will point out to them errors in
their English, to enable them to get
the maximum benefit from their courses.
The tutors began last week. Subse-
quently one of the men behind the
scheme, Dr W. S. Ramson, sub-dean
of the Faculty of Arts at the School
of General Studies, told us of the
genesis of this action — unprecedented
in Australian universities. He said
complaints from the people in the
faculty marking exam papers at the end
of 1963 led to the establishment of a
small committee to seek ways of im-
proving the situation. Research had
begun last August on Leaving Certi-
ficate students in Canberra.
Dr Ramson said he hoped to follow
the progress of the tested students and
try to form some conclusions based on
a study of the survey and of the reme-
dial work. If continued — this had not
yet been discussed —the scheme would
provide very valuable research material.
Poetry Selection
'C'rom May 8, the selection of poems
A in the book pages will be made by
Charles Higham. We shall be glad to
receive work and it should be addressed
to the Poetry Editor, The Bulletin,
Box 4088, GPO, Sydney. Poems will
be reported on quickly but there may be
some little delay in their publication on
acceptance, depending on the material
in hand.
LICENCES TO POISON HUSBANDS
feuLLe'tCn
80 Years Ago: May 2, 1885
IV/TRS Sarah Keep, aged 24, and her
step-grandmother, Mrs Mary
Burton, are* now lying under sentence
of death at Maitland. Women are the
cooks and nurses of the community,
and this wretched pair took advantage
° f Pf, - put
strychnine first into the food and hen
into the medicine of the husband of
the youngei convict, who, at the time,
had not been married more than six
months to her unhappy victim.
A more horrible case of cold-
blooded secret poisoning for the sake
of gain (and murder for such a motive
is utterly incapable of extenuation) is
not recorded in the annals of crime.
So far as anything in this world can
be certain, the charge has been clearly
sheeted home and proved to the hilt.
But there seems to be a general
opinion that the death penalty will
be remitted by the Executive. While
the more gentle customs of these
latter days preclude the possibility of
anyone crying aloud on such an
occasion for the blood of two miser-
able women, as might have been the
c f se years gone by, it is logically
f' ea U 11,31 b V reP r 'evmg these criminals
ment bee p abolishei i so p far as
the sex j s concernet i—f or jf women
who coolly conspire to poison a man
for the sake of his money are to be
reprieved, for what other crime can
any woman possibly be hanged? In
England such offences are the only
ones for which women are now ever
subjected to the capital penalty. The
question before the Executive now is:
Is it or is it not desirable that all
intending female poisoners in New
South Wales should be officially in-
formed that licences to poison their
husbands without incurring the death-
penalty are now issued from Govern-
ment House?

... and what positive steps are you taking for a peaceful solution of this dispute?"


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Noble American
nPwo facts of life about South-East
Asia appear to have escaped thir-
teen Anglican bishops. The first is that
Peking intends domination of all main-
land Asia (Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia,
Vietnam, Siam, Burma) and has also
created a broad red cummerbund
around the soft underbelly of Asia by
its authority over Indonesia. The
second fact is that unless Communist
imperialism is halted in Indo-China,
the frontline will inevitably become
Australia itself a collapse of the
whole democratic position in Asia.
Australia’s sanctity, in other words, is
now being decided for the next century
in the padi and rain forests of Indo-
China and in the South China Sea.
This sanctity is being protected, at
the moment, by American naval and
air power and by South Vietnamese
manpower. But as the intensity of the
war develops, it is certain that the
democracies will be required to in-
crease their commitment from mere
moral support to guns. It is to be
assumed that this was the mission of
Mr Henry Cabot Lodge to Australia
and New Zealand last week—to find
out just how many men and how much
equipment America’s allies will com-
mit to the Vietnamese war if it is
extended.
For the Americans are anxious to
gain for their war the full recognition
of a common cause that it is not
merely America against China but the
traditional democratic alliance defend-
ing its frontiers against the intrusions
of Communism.
In this context it is expected thht
when such an illustrious body as the
Anglican Church engages in criticism
of the democratic cause, its criticism
be informed and balanced. It is to be
regretted, therefore, that the implied
criticism of the American purpose in
Vietnam by the bishops in a letter to
the Prime Minister did not have the
quality of realism.
The Second Indo-China War was
not the creation of American policy.
It was initiated by the Communists
and, as in Korea, the Communists
themselves precipitated hostilities by
overtly and covertly moving beyond
internationally marked frontiers. They
have conducted their campaign with a
degree of terrorism and ruthlessness as
bloody as anything envisaged by
Genghis Khan. They have extermin-
ated Vietnamese rural leaders without
mercy, imposed their authority on wide
areas of South Vietnam in open con-
tempt of the 1954 Geneva Convention
drawn up to terminate the First Indo-
China War. They have prosecuted the
war without regard to internationally
accepted codes of conduct in warfare.
The involvement of Red China in the
Grand Design of Ho Chi-minh for the
unification of Vietnam under a Com-
munist Government has been proven
beyond doubt.
The Americans, on the other hand,
prosecuted the war with caution and
a respect for humanity. Now r they have
been compelled to hurt the Vietnamese
Communists where it hurts them most
—at home, by attacking North Viet-
nam and to attempt to enforce an
early conclusion of the war by using
napalm and tear gas.
Had the Americans not widened the
war the Vietcong would already have
subjugated the South and one of the
two Chinese pincers (the second is
aimed through Thailand down the
Malayan Peninsula) would have
reached the shores of the South China
Sea.
The new American tactic is to force
Ho Chi-minh to the conference halls of
Geneva, and the North Vietnamese
leader has been offered honorable
peace talks without conditions. This
offer has been rejected and escalation
of the war began the installation of
Russian missile sites around Hanoi,
the threat to dispatch elements of two
Chinese armies to support North Viet-
nam, and the offer of volunteers from
several countries in the Communist
bloc. A larger war now appears inevit-
able, and so, almost certainly, the
eventual commitment of Australian
combat troops to Vietnam. This may
already have been decided in principle
last week in Canberra during the visit
of Mr Cabot Lodge.
What is especially unfortunate is the
bishops’ sniping at the American pur-
pose. There was once a man called the
Ugly American in Asia a bumbling,
bourbon-swigging, good-natured, corn-
fed caricature of the American official
abroad. In Vietnam today as An-
thony Brown points out in his “Memo
to a Bishop” on page 32 of this issue
broad highways and wide bridges
mark the Mekong, water filtration
plants, hospitals, schools, hydro-elec-
tric installations, planned villages, new
communication and transportation sys-
tems a thousand benefits of a mod-
ern world dot the landscape as monu-
ments to American nobility. The
Americans are not fighting for a single
vested interest in Vietnam, they have
poured incalculable riches into this
sliver of Asia, and 2300 of their men
have shed blood in less than four years.
The term “The Noble American” de-
serves as much currency as the ugly
predecessor. The thirteen bishops may
well reflect that in the history of
modern warfare rarely has a nation
fought. so bravely and so generously
for so little in terms of tangible reward.
Congra tu lations
I>ook censorship in Australia is to-
** day a minor matte- as far as civil
liberties are concerned, especially
when compared, for example, with the
issues raised in a matter like the
Knopfelmacher case. There is no
longer any censorship of political
books in Australia, no censorship of
blasphemous works, ard only a few
cases of censorship of worthwhile
literary works.
Nevertheless, these remaining cases
of censorship are in themselves absurd;
and the Customs ban on C. H. Rolph’s
“The Trial of Lady Chatterley” is,
literally, disgraceful. The Sydney
publishers of the Australian edition of
this book therefore deserve full public
support. They also deserve congratu-
lations for their willingness to be
taken to court to test the label of
obscenity which the Customs Depart-
ment has pinned on the book.
The record shows that it is by fight-
ing censorship in court that the censor-
ship laws have been liberalised both
in Australia and overseas. There
should be more of this sort of thing
and one hopes that Minderon Pty Ltd
will keep up the good work by pub-
lishing other banned books, and in-
viting legal contests.

The Liberals’ May Day?
An election round-up
By BRIAN JOHNS
SYDNEY — New South Wales Labor,
contending with the most dangerous
threat in 24 years from the Liberal-
Country Party Opposition, had good
cause to worry even about it's long-
established friends last week. In
jeopardy already through possible in-
constancy among its crucial' Catholic
supporters because of the Opposition’s
promise of State Aid, Labor found itself
under fresh assault in traditional strong-
holds.
The activist New South Wales Teach-
ers’ Federation opened the assault with
full-page advertisements in the Press
urging all political parties to remove
teachers from the authority of the Pub-
lic Service Board by setting up an Edu-
cation Commission—an undertaking
already given by the Leader of the Oppo-
sition, Mr R. W. Askin, in his policy
speech. It was small comfort to the
Labor Party to see, linked with this un-
ambiguous demand, the indirect thrust
as Liberals in the Teachers’ Federation
call for all parties to seek large sums of
money from the Commonwealth “speci-
fically” for public school education.
More of Labor’s friends were to
supply ammunition against the Govern-
ment in the campaign. With only nine
days to go before the elections on May 1,
important Government unions last
Thursday publicly pressed the Premier,
Mr J. Renshaw, for immediate action
on pay rises.
At Transport House —headquarters of
the Australian Railways Union—in Syd-
ney, 300 railway and bus employees
passed a resolution demanding that the
State Government make an immediate
decision on incremental pay rises for
.61,000 employees. Early last month
Mr Renshaw rejected a claim for in-
creases ranging from 16s. 6d. a week
to 495. 6d. for the Government trans-
port workers. Since then transport em-
ployees have sent about 10,000 letters
to State members of parliament in sup-
port of their demands.
Even closer to home was the threat
of the administrative and clerical divi-
sion of the Public Service Association
of NSW to withdraw its “confidence” in
the'-State Government unless Mr Ren-
shaw intervened immediately to get
negotiations under way for salary rises
for its 8000 members.
The chairman of the division, Mr
A. C. Edwards, points out that his mem-
bers have been pressing for their salary
increase since last November and that the
Thursday meeting at the Town Hall was
really the climax of a succession of
“almost weekly” approaches to the
Government on the issue, but there can
be little minimising of the political nature
of last week’s meeting held in the midst
of an election campaign.
A resolution passed by the 1000 mem-
bers attending the meeting bluntly said
“that if the Government does not inter-
vene immediately in the dispute it will
have forfeited the right to the continued
confidence of the 8000 members of the
admihistrative arm of Government in
NSW”.
Earlier, Mr Edwards had told the
meeting that “the one course left to us,
forced on us by the Government and the
Board, is to go to the electoral ballot
box, which we can approach w'ith our
families, relatives, friends and neigh-
bors”. What further action the union
takes to direct its members and friends
at the polling booths remains to be seen.
There are plans to distribute a pamph-
let to employees at State Government
departments outlining the history of the
issue and carrying Mr Edwards’ advice
on the polling booths. Labor men will
remember campaigns the union's Com-
monwealth counterpart, the Administra-
tive and Clerical Officers’ Association,
waged against some Federal Liberal
ministers in the 1961 and 1963 elections.
In 1961 the Commonwealth public ser-
vants went to the extent of organising
door-knocks, leaflets, public meetings,
and booth workers, as retribution to a
Government it regarded as unsympathe-
tic.
The State Aid issue was kept moving
by a second anonymous letter on the
NSW Liberal Party’s letterhead repeat-
ing the charge that Liberal promises of
State Aid to independent schools had
split the Party. The anonymous letters
are the only sign of this. They appear
to be the work of the hard core of anti-
state Aiders preaching to the converted
but thly could have an impact unex-
pected by the authors. The publicity

J. RENSHAW
given to them will further highlight to
Catholics the breakthrough in Liberal
policy of Mr Askin’s undertaking on
interest payments for buildings at inde-
pendent schools.
The Democratic Labor Party—con-
testing 28 key seats —will inevitably aid
the Opposition. As usual the DLP's
highest hope is to prove to be the de-
cisive force in elections through the dis-
tribution of their preferences. Party
officials themselves admit, however, that
their campaigns do swing some Labor
voters direct to the Liberal Party. In
the present campaign the DLP's empha-
sis on the Federal domination of NSW
Labor and on Communist association
with Labor, and the subsidiary stress on
education dovetail neatly with the Oppo-
sition’s approach. Late last week the
DLP launched a series of 30-second
spot ads on TV which will have the side-
effect of sharpening the Party’s
claim to notice.
In one of the shrewdest moves in the
campaign the DLP has brought Mr
Vince Gair, senator-elect and former
Queensland Labor Premier, to Sydney
for a heavy round of meetings. Mr
Gair’s Government was brought down
after conflict with his State and Federal

machine in 1957 —a story with some
point because of ragged relations be-
tween the NSW Government and the
ALP Federal executive. Mr Gair is
underscoring this by reminding the elec-
torate that the ALP Federal executive
prevented NSW Labor implementing its
1963 conference decision for direct aid
in the form of science blocks.
This week the Prime Minister, Sir
Robert Menzies, whose earlier part in
the campaign struck the keynote of the
Opposition’s approach, re-entered the
lists in a telecast on national and com-
mercial stations. Not all observers are
convinced of the effectiveness of crowd-
ing Federal issues into the State sphere,
but the Liberal Party has taken a cal-
culated risk on this in an attempt to off-
set Labor’s advantage of having been
able to cushion possible losses by carry-
ing out public works in particular elec-
torates.
For all the manoeuvres in the cam-
paign so far, only Party officials are
predicting the outcome. Except on the
issues of State Aid and the wage de-
mands by unions, there have been no
highlights and public interest does not
seem high. Labor Party officials are
pleased by the quiet tempo on the cal-
culation that this always favors the
Government. On the other hand, Liberal
Party tacticians in Ash Street are
pleased with reports of confidence from
organisers.
But it seems that the election must
be close. The Opposition needs to win
seven new seats to win power in the
Legislative Assembly of 94. In the
face of the record Liberal vote in NSW
in the 1963 Federal and the 1964 Senate
elections —in the latter the highest in
40 years —it is difficult to challenge
that there is a swing to the Liberal Party,
especially since the figures show a close
co-relation between the Federal and
State Liberal vote in New South Wales.
This makes the Liberal Party confi-
dent that it will regain the metropolitan
seats of Bligh, Coogee and Drummoyne;
and the traditional Liberal seat of
Nepean. For the remaining three seats
there are at least 12 that could go to
the Opposition—notably Goulburn and
Monaro —where any Libral or Country
Party inroad on the Catholic vote could
be decisive.
Because of population shifts and other
local factors Labor Party officials be-
lieve that a number of seats now held
by the Opposition are in danger, inclu-
ding Gosford, Albury, the Upper Hun-
ter, and the electorate celebre, Dubbo,
due to the Commonwealth-State airlines
dispute.
The Liberal Party adds to the mosaic
of possibilities by claiming that a tradi-
tional “blue ribbon” Labor seat of Cobar
is in grave danger and that the Premier's
seat of Castlereagh is threatened.
There is a further wide selection of
the possible shape of the electorate pat-
tern, but the present situation amounts
to a Government with 21 seats in doubt
—certain trouble for those hopes of
making May 1 in fact Labor Day.
PREMIERS’ CONFERENCE
Text for Changing Times
States submit to the Commonwealth
By DAVID ROBERTSON
CANBERRA ■ — Many things have
changed about the finance talks between
the Commonwealth and States in the
last six years. At Premiers' Conferences
in March and June, 1959, the Common-
wealth and the six States gathered in
Canberra and framed a new financial
agreement between the Commonwealth
and the States expiring on June 30 this
year.
At a Premiers’ Conference in Canberra
last Thursday—to be continued in June
—the Commonwealth and States again
met to consider an agreement to replace
the existing one. Some of the personali-
ties had changed at last week’s talks.
Sir Thomas Playford, almost a per-
manent Premier of South Australia, was
finally missing from the scene, and ; n
his place was Mr F. H. WaLh, attending
his first Conference. The Premier of
NSW in 1959. Mr J. J. Cahill, has since
died, and his successor, Mr J. B. Rcn-
shaw, was at this year’s Conference in
his stead, succeeding the interim Premier,
Mr R. J. Heffron.
The other dramatis personae were still
in office—the Prime Minister, Sir Robert
Menzies, the Deputy Premier and
Minister for Trade, Mr McEwen, the
Treasurer, Mr Harold Holt, and the
Premiers of Victoria, Mr Henry Bolte,
Queensland, Mr Nicklin, Western Aus-
tralia, Mr Brand, and Tasmania, Mr
Reece.
There are other changes basically
caused by the centralisation of Govern-
ment activity. The two Conferences in
1959 produced documented proceedings
at considerable length, and appreciable
time was devoted to discussion at sessions
open to the Press.
This time none of the hours of
discussion was in open session. This
allocation of time was much shorter than
the Commonwealth itself and the
Premiers had envisaged—the talks were
expected to continue until noon on
Friday.
This in itself was an indication of the
increased complexity of the pattern of
Governmental decision-making. It is not
S. F. NICKLIN
F. H. WALSH
what happened in the public councils that
today influences significantly the life of
the Federation that is Australia, but
what happens in the private rooms of the
Federal Treasury and the Federal
Cabinet.
A more fundamental fact of last
Thursday’s Commonwealth-State meet-
ing is that -it was not a discussion at all.
When earlier in the year Sir Robert
Menzies convened the Premiers’ Con-
ference he announced that it would allow
State or Commonwealth representatives
to present proposals for changes in the
current financial arrangements, and that
a further meeting in June —the regular
date for the annual Premiers’ Conference
would be necessary to settle new
arrangements in detail.
The State Premiers each did present
views on the solution of the tax re-
imbursement problem and criticisms of


the unsatisfactory nature of the present
agreement, but the Commonwealth put
forward no proposal at all. At the begin-
ning of the meeting Mr Holt outlined
broadly the Commonwealth assessment
of the economy and the Commonwealth’s
own budgetary problems, including its
increased commitment for defence, the
decline in the balance of payments and
the fact that the Commonwealth must
underwrite the shortfall in recent loan
raisings. .
Sir Robert Menzies concluded the
meeting by assuring the Premiers that
t e Commonwealth would give full con-
sideration to their arguments and that
they had made a valuable contribution
towards a settlement of the problem of
mancial relationships.
nstead of discussing, the Common-
wealth listened. No Premier was re-
buffed, and consequently each Premier
was entitled to leave Canberra with his
ta * e o, ]'^ ers ’ egos intact.
t Wl]l oe a different matter, of course,
when the Premiers return to Canberra
in June to hear the result of the Com-
monwealth s consideration of the future
financial agreement. By then the Com-
monwealth will have marshalled its case
and will present a tough front,
The fundamental change between 1959
and 1965 seems to be that the atmo-
sphere of an exchange of views in which
State and Commonwealth representatives
thrash out points over a table has given
way to a series of submissions by the
States akin to those of departments sub-
mitting their annual programmes to the
Treasury for approval,
Probably the reason for this trend is
the inevitably growing complexity of the
Australian economy, relying as it does
on an increasing number of inter-related
factors at home and abroad,
It is also probably an extension of
“Treasury thinking”—the ability to view
nothing in isolation but as it may
influence almost all other arms of Gov-
ernment activity.
Whatever the reasons, some of the
Premiers may have left Canberra won-
dering when the day will arrive when
Commonwealth decision-making will be-
come still more anonymous and their
presence will become superfluous not
even to discuss, not even to submit a
viewpoint.
COOK ISLANDS
But Still Kiwis
Self-government a panic move?
By GORDON CHESTERMAN
SYDNEY —WhiIe Australia still has
the problem of resettling 2700 Nau-
ruans when the island’s phosphate is
worked out in 25 years, Keith Holyoake’s
National New Zealand Government has
forged ahead with its self-government
scheme for its tiny dependency, the Cook
Islands group. Last week the Cook is-
landers went to the polls in an election
for a new Legislative Assembly which
will determine the future status of their
territory.
K. HOLYOAKE
The principal issue of the election was
the proposed Constitution, which, if ac-
cepted by the new Assembly, will give
the islanders complete internal self-
government. Results of the election (con-
tested by four political groups, the Cook
Islanders’ Party, a Labor Party, a United
Party and an independent body), which
should be announced shortly, could, how-
ever, place the NZ Government in an
awkward position should the strong Cook
Islanders’ Party notch the majoritv of
votes.
Observers believe that if this party,
headed by Mr Albert Henry, does win, it
could force the Government to amend
the Constitution. What is objected to, ap-
parently, is the stipulation that no resident
of the islands can stand for the Legis-
lative Assembly unless he has been in the
territory for three or more years. Unfor-
tunately, Mr Henry, resident in the islands
for about a year, could find himself in
this position. The Constitution, which has
been approved by both the Legislative
Assembly and the NZ Parliament, is not
yet law and will not become so until the
islanders themselves approve it. So the
final decision rests with the representa-
tives who will be chosen from last week’s
elections.
Obviously the first task of the ne\j
Assembly will be to discuss this drafl
Constitution and decide on its adoption
Should it become law as expected, this
will involve changes in the form oi
government. The main effect will be to
complete the progress of giving the islan-
ders sole control over their Government.
Under the Constitution, the future of the
20,000 islanders living on the 15 islands
in the group will be shaped by the islan-
ders. The Assembly will make laws, and
not the NZ Government; the Premier
and his Cabinet will direct the adminis-
tration, and not the NZ Government.
The present Assembly was given wide
powers of legislation; it alone authorised
the spending of Government money in the
islands. The new Assembly, though, will
go further, for the Constitution states
that it will have power to alter any law
affecting the islands, whether those laws
were made by earlier Assemblies or by
the NZ Parliament. It will also have the
power to amend the Constitution.
Before the Constitution was drawn up,
the NZ Government made it clear that
its help could be relied on, whatever,
form of government was chosen. At no
time had NZ regarded the attainment of
self government as in any way changing
its special obligations towards the islands.
(In July, 1962, the Minister of Island
Territories asked the Legislative Assembly
to decide what form of government it
wanted. There were four alternatives: in-
dependence, integration with NZ, a
Polynesian Federation, or self-govern-
ment together with continued association
with NZ. The Assembly, possibly wisely,
chose the latter.) The Cook Islands Con-
stitution Act (which is the NZ Act con-
taining the Constitution) declares that the
status of the islanders as NZ citizens ; s
not affected, and hence they will continue
with the same right of free entry into NZ.
Both the Prime Minister and the
Leader of the Opposition, Mr A. H.
Nordmeyer, have given assurances that
NZ responsibility to provide financial
assistance will not be lessened after self-
government. Both have also pledged
that the islands’ products will continue
to enjoy free entry into the NZ market.
While the islands’ move has generally
been regarded as -progressive, Labor
politician Mr Mathison considered the
Government was going too fast in giving
self-government and a Constitution to
the islands. Regardless of what the
islanders’ elected representatives might
feel, said Mr Mathison, if the issue were
put to the people by referendum they
might express themselves as not yet
ready for self-government. Mr Mathison,
who had been Labor’s Minister of Island
Territories, said he considered a 1960
resolution of the UN had panicked the
National Government’s previous Islands
Minister, Sir Leon Gotz, into accelera-
ting self-government.


LOCAL GOVERNMENT
£ 1 a minute
“Insufferable and impertinence ”
C. JONES
BRISBANE The people of this
city were shocked last week when the
Brisbane City Council aldermen gave
themselves a £lO a week wage rise. The
amount was startling enough, but what
angered many people was the time taken
to decide on the rise ... 10 minutes.
Typical of the protests against the wage.,
rise was one from the Municipal Officers’
Association secretary, Mr H. R. Morton,
who described the aldermen’s decision
as “insufferable and impertinence”.
The controversial council decision sets
an ordinary alderman’s salary at £2586
a year, chairman of the council and
committees at £2396, and that of the
Lord Mayor, Alderman Clem Jones, at
£5OOO. But Aid. Jones will receive his
money as expenses instead of his old
payment of £3OOO in wages and £2OOO
in expenses.
Assailed on all sides last week, Aid.
Jones, leader of the ALP aldermen in
power in the council, refused to bow
down. He said that the £lO increase was
regarded by himself and other aldermen
as a car allowance. Some aldermen, he
said, travelled 250 miles a week on
council business and had never been
paid a car allowance. Aid. Jones hotly
refuted a suggestion that council aider-
men were only “part-time employees”.
And Aid. Jones claimed that although
Melbourne aldermen received nothing
and Sydney aldermen £5 a meeting—or
a maximum of £250 a year—Brisbane
people paid less for their aldermen. “We
have only 29 aldermen for our council
area, which is the largest of any council
in the world,” he said.
But one comment by Aid. Jones added
to the criticism. He said that it did not
matter when the public was told of a
salary rise and the council itself could
make the decision legitimately at any
time—there was no need for an indepen-
dent salary fixing tribunal to be set up.
The Citizens’ Municipal Organisation
aldermen opposition in the council
and Liberal in their views supported
the salary rise, but later were rebuked
by their own committee which promised
to appoint an independent tribunal, if
elected in 1967, to review the wage rise
and to decrease it if necessary.
The salary rise decision could have
far-reaching effects, even outside the
council, for the decision was made
without any prior consultation between
Labor aldermen and the Queensland
Central Executive of the Australian
Labor Party. There was consultation in
1962 when aldermen previously increased
their salaries. Aid Jones has been sug-
gested several times as a future ALP
State or even Federal ALP parlia-
mentarian —but following the salary rise
decision he no longer can be certain of
solid support from the Queensland ALP
Central Executive.
MARKETING
The Wool Clip
Dr Melville’s Hint
CANBERRA Supporters of a re-
serve price scheme for wool may be
forgiven for presuming that victory was
within their grasp when Dr J. Melville
announced last week that the Australian
wool industry conference had recom-
mended a compulsory referendum of
woolgrowers. The conference had not
actually approved the scheme itself, but
the writing was on the wall
All the questions, all the doubts
seemed to have been dealt with and Sir
William Gunn would soon be careering
about the countryside explaining why
producers of 10 bales and more would
each get one vote, why the multiple
voting system had been rejected and
why the referendum result should be
based on a simple majority.
But one real hint of trouble came
when Dr Melville began fumbling badly
at a Press conference he held to explain
the complicated operation of the con-
ference. The Pressmen wanted to be
assured that they were right in assuming
the Federal Government would retain the
ultimate power to fix the reserve price
for wool. But Dr Melville, though he
could be led to water, would not drink.
The new Wool Marketing Authority,
he explained, would carefully examine
all the evidence, set a reserve price of
its own and pass the details on to
Sir William Gunn’s Australian Wool
Board. The board, “with the co-opera-
tion” of the AWIC, would take a* look
and then make a submission to the
Minister for Primary Industry, Mi'
Adermann.
Fine. So the Government retained
the final word in fixing the price? “No,”
said the Doctor. Does anybody have
the final say? “I am not prepared to
answer any further than that,” said Dr
Melville.
He merely repeated his outline of the
mechanism of getting a recommendation
to the Minister. Dr Melville had an
excellent reason for dodging the price-
fixing question: The woolmen want the
Federal Government to agree to a pro-
posal which would prevent Mr Ader-
mann or Cabinet from exercising the
right to fix the reserve price.
Whether Sir Robert Menzies will agree
to allow the Wool Board or any other
body to assume such huge responsibility
in the operation of Australia’s major
industry is doubtful.
This apart, Dr Melville’s words were
cold comfort for the woolgrowers already
feeling the pinch of wool levies.
Mr Adermann had promised that in
raising the £3O million over the first
seven years of the scheme woolgrowers
would not face an overall levy of more
than three per cent a year of the gross
proceeds of wool sold.
Dr Melville calmly pointed out that
the levy could well exceed three per
cent research funds were running
down dangerously and the amount of
capital brought in by levy would naturally
vary with the size of the clip and the
price it brought.

MEDICINE
Doctors in
The House
Exemption from zoning
SYDNEY “Extraordinary, auto-
cratic and bureaucratic attitude” is the
prognosis of Dr N. Larkins, secretary of
the NSW branch of the Australian
Medical Association, speaking of the
case of the three Warilla doctors
threatened with eviction from their prac-
tice in the South Coast area just beyond
Wollongong.
The case began early this month when
the Shellharbour Council served notice
on the three doctors to quit their surgery.
Last week, after 1200 letters had been
sent to the local State member, Mr
Lewis, by angry residents, columns of
publicity in the local Press, representa-
tions to the minority Labor group of five
aldermen, and an undertaking by the
Leader of the Opposition, Mr R. W.
Askin, that he will see that doctors’
surgeries are exempt from zoning regula-


tionfr, the council grudgingly agreed to
support an appeal by the medicos to the
State Planning Authority for an exemp-
tion.
This case is of immediate concern to
the AMA because on at least two
occasions it has had appeals from local
groups on the inadequate number of
doctors in this South Coast area. These
local groups are not on their own: of
the 3000 GPs in NSW fewer than 1000
are practising in country areas. The
AMA is most concerned at the shortage
and the problem is under frequent dis-
cussion at monthly meetings of the
AMA-Minister for Health liaison com-
mittee.
“Here we are working with one Gov-
ernment department attempting to solve
the problem and another is aggravating
1 the situation. There have been numerous
cases similar to the Warilla doctors in
other parts of the State,” Dr Larkins
said.
“We intend to fight this to the bitter
end,” the group’s spokesman, Dr Bruce
Sheldon, told The Bulletin. “The issue
has wide implications for doctors with
practices in developing and country
areas.”
One of the obstacles is that a doctor
who has established a surgery in his
home —allowed by councils if he remains
living on the premises—and finds that
he needs larger accommodation for a
group practice has to move away from
the residence altogether unless one of
the group lives on in the house, which
is just not possible in many cases because
the surgery expansion has taken the
room.
“So we have to find accommodation
in a commercial area,” says Dr Sheldon.
“Apart from the expense, can you tell
me why going to a doctor should mean
the same trouble as going shopping?”
asks Dr Sheldon rhetorically. “Surely a
doctor should be as close to his patients
as possible.”
Zoning regulations are not the only
official restrictions doctors are smarting
under in developing areas. For nearly
10 years the AMA has been waging an
intermittent battle with the State Housing
Commission over conditions of tenancy
for doctors. As a means of attracting
doctors to new areas the Housing Com-
mission gives a priority allocation to
doctors.
But doctors are bitter about the con-
ditions of tenancy. The abrasive points
are that, short of extraordinary circum-
stances, they cannot sell their practice
for two years, and when it is sold they
have to give a third of the goodwill
gained or a third of the value assessed
by the Commission —the latter percent-
age going to the Commission each and
every time the practice is sold.
AROUND MELBOURNE
There’s Money in Mulga
/~\nce upon a time the windows of
Melbourne’s tobacco shops were
altogether irresistible. There were
racks of Dunhill, Loewe, Barling and
Meerschaum pipes, 'great bins full of
the finest shag, urns of snuff and cedar
boxes carefully packed with coronas
from Cuba, Manila and Amsterdam.
Now the tobacconist windows are full
of koala bears, boomerang money
boxes, kangaroo fur moccasins and
shiny mulga maps of Australia with
barometers smack in the centre. There
is more money to be made out of
mulga and kangaroo than cigarettes
and cigars.
Indeed the National Travel As-
sociation here is all for it. It points
out that over 160,000 tourists visited
Australia last year and 71 per cent
took something home. In 1963, for
example, the visitors spent £26 mil-
lion. Some of it had to go on
souvenirs. Your correspondent man-
aged to find Australia’s leading sou-
venir man, John Frost, just before he
left for Manila, Hong Kong and Japan
on Sunday. The Frosts have had a
family tobacco business since 1898,
but now souvenirs are looking even
better. Over the back of a chair Mr
Frost had a pile of glistening gold
and silver hides like something out of
Goldfinger. “That’s the very latest
thing, metalised kangaroo hide, an
entirely new process. Beautiful for
shoes and handbags. Sure to go in
Hong Kong. In Asia I’m planning to
show all sorts of Australian souvenirs,
genuine boomerangs from the Queens-
land Native Affairs Department, toy
koalas, kangaroo-hide wallets, hand-
bags and so on. I have the Depart-
ment of Trade right behind me and
I'm sure department stores up there
will open all-Australian sections.”
Mr Frost is right. The world doesn’t
know enough about our souvenirs.
Just at the moment the kangaroo is
doing a particularly noble job. Apart
from carrying the Qantas image, he is
being turned into wallets, purses, hand-
bags, moccasins, desert boots, cushi-
ons, car mats, belts, rugs, passport
covers, and there is even a very nice
line in kangaroo fur hot-water bottle
covers. What’s more you can buy him
cut into little furry squares the
dinkum Aussie postcard. In the win-
dow of the Southern Cross Hotel
there is the ultimate kangaroo sou-
venir. It is the actual paw of a kan-
garoo, maybe 18 inches long with
the paw on one end and a chrome
bottle opener on the other. Kangaroo
skin is easily the best seller, and, of
course, from kangaroo all the best
toy koalas are made. The latest
are extremely attractive. You get
them with a zip down the middle
and your koala serves as a pyjama
case. There are wind-up koalas which
give forth “Waltzing Matilda” from
the depths of their stomachs. Size is
no limit: John Frost recalls that the
biggest koala order he ever received
was from Mike Todd. He wanted a
toy koala and a toy kangaroo each
nearly five feet high. The koala cost
£5B and the kangaroo £6B. They
were so large he bought another plane
ticket so that they could ride back
with him and Liz in the aircraft cabin
to the US. Yes, the koala and kan-
garoo had their very own seat. Mulga,
too, is in the ascendant. Think of an
object and it is available in mulga.
There are mulga gum leaf ash trays,
mulga book-ends, mulga crib boards,
clocks, thermometers, barometers,
calendars, inkstands, nut crackers,
boomerangs, paper knives. There is
an intriguing example of the mulga
art, a set of mulga salt and pepper
shakers each carved to the shape of
the map of Australia. There are gem-
stone or opal cufflinks, sheepskin
jackets and dinner plates decorated
with Aboriginal art. With each one of
those genuine Queensland boomerangs
comes a pamphlet entitled “Boomer-
ang throwing made easy”.
There was just one cause for con-
cern. Could the kangaroo stand the
export pace? Mr Frost referred me to
Mr F. G. Langer, managing director
of Portex Trading Co., the man who
is metalising those skins for export.
He said: “I'm not worried. There are
300 million kangaroos in Australia.
In Queensland and West Australia
they’re a pest. We get most of ours
from Queensland and they reproduce
so fast. Do you realise that their
reproductive force is so strong that
if a baby Joey dies in the pouch an-
other is born immediately. This can
happen quite a number of times with
no contact whatever with the male.”
This was something to think about
for the male kangaroo.

to stand in a queue and she has far less
chance of getting the book she needs.
Even if she does she will have to be
fairly quick off the mark to get back to
her seat before her books are shoved
on to the floor by another student after
the permissible regulation twenty minutes
absence is up. She can then sit on the
floor, or stand, or giving up for the time
being she can join another queue—at the
library’s sandwich shop, in the mixed
lounge for espresso coffee, in the
cafeteria for lunch. Or at least she could
until this year. Even at this, the uni-
versity of queues and quotas, she can
no longer queue for a cafeteria lunch
because the cafeteria is closed; building
alterations are going on at Union House
in the middle of first term.
Without realising it, both girls, at the
tender age of 19, are suffering from “The
Bulge”, “The Trend”, and “The Swing”.
They are members of a “cohort”, victims
of “the population explosion” and of
“the knowledge explosion”. If they have
the time or the inclination to read the
newspapers they may find, with increas-
ing frequency in the last few years, that
they are also suffering from a “crisis of
numbers”. None of which jargon helps
to get the English I essay in on time, but
explains at least partially why there is
so much trouble in completing it.
The jargon and the figures to which
it points summarises the quantitative
aspects of what has been described as
the real social revolution of the latter
half of the 20th century —the revolution
of rising educational aspirations among
the growing numbers of young people
in the highly industrialised and urbanised
countries.
Australia has shared in this revolution
and the recently issued Martin report on
tertiary education* is an attempt to
explain and to understand the dimensions
of the revolution and an attempt to
come to terms with it. Because many
of its recommendations go beyond the
quantitative aspects to a qualitative dis-
cussion of the dilemmas facing uni-
versities, the Martin report —in much
the same way as the now historic Robbins
report did in Britain — may provide the
basis for a new kind of debate about
what Australian universities should be
like and what they do.
It is the first major step in this country
at looking at the future of the universities
in terms other than the very basic ones
of how many members of the 17-22
cohort the demographer’s name for
age-group should attend the universi-
ties and how much staff is needed to
teach them.
Some of the broader issues which the
report raises have previously been dis-
cussed by individual specialists at special
conferences and seminars. Some of the
major recommendations in the report
have already been attacked by academics
and administrators. Some of the main
ideas have been rejected by the Federal
Government. But because it does re-
present a reference point—a public start-
ing point not limited to the views of
small groups (the committee heard 500
submissions from interested groups and
individuals) —it provides a basis for
beginning a wider discussion in Aus-
tralia about the crisis of quality rather
than only the crisis of numbers.
Discussing the report, one lecturer at
Melbourne University said: “Some of us
in the university have been talking about
this need to look at things qualitatively
for a long time now. But it’s all a bit of
a sick joke to talk about the need for
research, about getting more honors
students, about the need for diversity
and the rest when the only place I can
give a tutorial is in my office with the
phone going and with otner students
wanting to see me or hand in essays or
losing their way interrupting all the time.
And all this with 23 students in a room

that can comfortably take eight. It’s
worse than a football match.”
Melbourne presents one Australian
university of the 19605, in extremis. Its
problems are in some ways the most
spectacularly acute of all the universities
old or new. And the students know it.
The first issue of this year’s student
newspaper, “Farrago”, devoted its main
front page story to a message from the
President of the Students’ Representa-
tive Council, Gareth Evans. It began:
“The critical shortage of staff, spare
books and equipment that we endured all
last year shows no signs yet of being
alleviated.” Pointing out that the Aus-
tralian Universities Commission had
rejected a request for a £600,000
emergency grant put to it by the Uni-
versity Council, the message refers to
two reports presented to university
authorities late last year from the Staff
Association and the SRC.
A sorry tale emerged of hopeless over-
crowding in lectures, a near-breakdown
in the library which led to a students’
sit-in demonstration, and the collapse
of any meaningful staff-student contacts
in many departments some where
tutorials had been abandoned, in others
where they continued under extreme
overcrowded conditions. A more recent
edition of “Farrago” went further and
called for the resignation of the whole
university administration which it blamed
for what it described as ~a “Varsity
Shambles”.
But in the same editorial “Farrago”
admitted that “a tradition of active,
creative student life still exists”. Ironic-
ally enough the very overcrowding, the
physical pressures, the anonymity of
the crowd atmosphere seems to have had
at least one effect —it has roused the
students themselves into acting, protest-
ing and above all gathering reliable
evidence on which to pursue their pro-
tests. Yet with all its problems Mel-
bourne University may, in the words of
its Vice-Chancellor, Sir George Paton,
not be suffering from a “crisis”, if by
crisis is meant a complete breakdown of
university services. While many staff
members and most students would say
that the only argument was on the
question of “complete”, it is still true
that with nearly 14,000 students Mel-
bourne still manages to graduate students
of high merit, valuable research con-
tinues, and some departments are still
very much the leaders in their field in
Australia.
In his public statements Sir George
has taken the view that Melbourne, which
produces 26 per cent of the country’s
graduates, is particularly vulnerable be-
cause it gets only 19 per cent of the
available funds for university education.
Another part of the picture of Aus-
tralian universities can be seen by


looking at the planned development of
the new university at Bedford Park in
Adelaide. It will open in 1966 as a new
campus of the University of Adelaide
with the idea of limiting the enrolment
at the old university to 8000 and the
new campus to 6000. It hopes to open
with undergraduate and graduate schools
of physical sciences, biological sciences,
social sciences, and language and
literature. Following the pattern of
some of the newer, more experimental
universities in Britain they will abolish
departments and faculties in favor of
schools headed by Directors of Studies.
It is planned to replace the nine or ten
subject Arts degree by a limited number
of alternative courses of study most
including two disciplines throughout the
course. Each student will have one
intensive tutorial per week in which he
will discuss all his assignments with a
tutor rather than as at present attending
a number of different tutorials in a group
for each subject. In the words of one
Adelaide academic, Professor H. Stret-
ton: “He is to be one student, not several
enrolments”. The campus also plans to
build a residential village with oppor-
tunities for the intermixing of staff and
students. And, most ambitiously, it is
hoped to give professors back the chance
to work as scholars and teachers with
no permanent departmental or admini-
strative duties. Students, academics and
administrators at Melbourne may well
be envious.
On the Australian scene it is not too
much to call this a bold experiment.
Yet, whatever success Bedford Park will
have, there still remains the nagging
frustration which pervades some of the
older universities like Melbourne, be-
cause many of its difficulties are shared
in lesser degrees by others. Nearly all
arise largely from “The Bulge”, “The
Trend”, and “The Swing”—names given
overseas to describe the distinctive
growth of universities in the last decade.
The Bulge, the population pressure
which has now reached its peak in Aus-
tralia and will have passed it next year,
was as is now generally and ruefully
known far greater than originally pre-
dicted. The Bulge has kept on bulging
and the Martin report estimates that it
will reach 86,400 by 1967. This expan-
sion of demand will continue after next
year at a slower rate and flatten out by
1975.
Together with The Trend (the per-
manent growth of students in the com-
munity seeking higher education) and
The Swing (the growth of demand from
science and technology), The Bulge has
brought on Australia’s educational revo-
lution so that by 1975 there will be,
according to the Martin report, 125,000
students at universities.
One way to see the links between The
Bulge and The Trend is to note the
Martin report’s comment that, in the
period 1946-63, the increase in the 17-22
age group was 32 per cent, whereas the
number of enrolments at universities
went up by 220 per cent. Between 1957
and 1963 it doubled. By 1975 it will
have increased another 80 per cent.
It is not just that there is not enough
places at the moment for universities to
put these students but, more intractably,
there are not enough teachers to teach
them. The report says that in order to
maintain the staff student ratio at the
1963 level (already inadequate), 1420
new staff will be required between 1964-
67, 2100 between 1968-71 and 1320
between 1972-75. Since the universities
in Britain, the main source of academic
appointments, are expanding at a great
rate, most of these will have to come
from the post-graduate ranks of the Aus-
tralian universities. Here is the nub of
the problem facing Australian universities
—how to ensure their own survival and
expansion by their own efforts.
Diversity and conformity
Professor Borrie at the Australian
National University has pointed out,
The Bulge, if handled properly, can be
more than just a short-term nightmare;
it may be “a long-term blessing”, so that
the staff shortage problem is not com-
pletely without some solution. If the uni-
versities can make greater efforts to
encourage students to do honors courses,
to continue with higher degrees, and to
stay at the universities for longer, then
perhaps the nightmare can become a
blessing.
It is against this background that the
Martin report discusses the dilemmas
facing the universities.
The questions covered include: How
has social change affected the responsi-
bilities of the universities? How can the
quality of teaching be improved? What
should be the relationship between teach-
ing and research? How big should a
university be? It discusses the im-
portance of developing a first class com-
munity, the need for diversity and experi-
mentation, the need to revise ideas about
administration, the high wastage and
failure rates, and the weaknesses of part-
time studies.
The chapter dealing with universities
in particular begins with a criticism of
the conservatism of academics. In-
dividual academics may have been far-
sighted enough to foresee future prob-
lems, but as institutions the report finds
that their universities have been “slow
to clarify and restate objectives and to
reorganise their activities to meet modern
needs”.
Echoing points which have previously
been raised by some academics, most
persistently and articulately by Professor
P. H. Partridge of the ANU, the report
adds that a silence envelopes the Aus-
tralian academic scene. “There has been
far too little discussion, investigation and
experimentation.”
Taking up a further theme of Pro-
fessor Partridge, the report calls for more
educational research within the universi-
ties to fill large gaps for which there is
no systematic information on student
performance, educational problems and
follow-up studies. Quoting Sir Eric
Ashby, the report says: “Universities,
although dedicated to the pursuit of
knowledge, are reluctant to pursue know-
ledge about themselves.”
One of the most controversial con-
clusions of the report has been ,ts
case against part-time studies, and its
recommendation that measures should
be taken to reduce the number of part-
time students. For a start the report
notes the very high percentage of part-
time students undertaking studies —3B
per cent in 1963 mostly in arts, com-
merce and economics, science, engineer-
ing and education. “The success rates
of part-time students are extremely dis-
appointing, often not more than 10 per
cent.” The committee takes the view
that this is due to disabilities inherent
in a long part-time course as well as to
lack of ability. Associate Professor S.
Encel of the ANU has strongly supported
this view, and believes that this is one
of the points at which the Martin re-
port’s conclusions come into direct con-
flict with the interests of government
and industry. The Federal Government
has rejected the committee’s conclusion
on part-time study to the chagrin of
many academics —but not all. Partridge
has taken a different view. Speaking at
the 1965 Summer School of the Institute
of Political Science in Canberra, he said:
“I doubt the wisdom of encouraging a
great number of students who now study
part-time to become full-time students
immediately they leave school; for many
students a mixture, or sometimes an
alternation, of work and study may be
the best thing.”
But Partridge concludes that while
the universities will have to continue and
indeed experiment with other forms of
part-time and external education, he
emphasises that this need not apply to
ALL the universities. Here he and the
Martin report are again at one in their
call for the introduction of some diversity
into the generally dull grey sameness
about all Australian universities. Why
should not all our universities be en-
couraged to have their special emphases?
The Martin report hopes that in the
planning of new institutions “the experi-
mental will be boldly mixed with the
proven”—and “universities should from

time to time examine the content of their
courses to discover what should be
added in the light of new knowledge and
also what should be discarded as out-
moded”. To some extent there is already
a clear emphasis emerging in some uni-
versities with some departments earning
special reputations.
But this emphasis is more due to
accident than design. A planned special-
isation would result in a system similar
to the American higher education net-
work where some institutions are highly
specialised in research, others in under-
graduate technology teaching, others in
liberal arts. Partridge has argued that
this policy of special emphasis Would
have the advantage of achieving “greater
excellence in different areas of advanced
education and provided for the consider-
able quantitative expansion at all levels”.
In a paper which forms part of a
book soon to be published by F. W.
Cheshire*, Professor Stretton suggests
that such diversification could come
through establishing clusters of smaller
universities in metropolitan areas rather
than the present policy of building up
“monsters”. Again one of the most
controversial conclusions of the Martin
report has been the one on the size of
universities. Commendably the Martin
report swings away from the usual argu-
ments about the financial cost of bigness
and emphasises instead the effect of a
large university on the quality of educa-
tion, the staff-student relationship, the
indefinable atmosphere of the place. It
lists some ten disadvantages of a large
university from the loss of identity of
the undergraduate and the impersonal
nature of contacts between staff and
students to the disintegration of the uni-
versity’s identity and its lapse into con-
formity. There is creeping bureaucratisa-
tion and deterioration of academic
morale.
It accepts that there may be some ad-
vantages in size—presumably concentra-
tion of research facilities and brains —
but concludes that there cannot be any
agreed Criteria by which optimum size
can be judged. Nevertheless, it maintains
that, in Australian conditions, “the dis-
advantages of smallness may become
significant for universities of less than
about 4000 students, and those of large-
ness for universities of more than about
10,000”.
The Federal Government has rejected
this view—and at least some university
administrators are pleased. Australia has
not yet produced its own Clark Kerr,
President of the University of California.
Dr Kerr, who heads a university which
will by 1975 have as many students as
all Australian universities together, is
the high-priest of the idea of a giant
university—or “the multiversity” as it
has become known. In his book, “The
Uses of the University”, Kerr has pre-
sented the classic defence of what Encel
has called the “service station” concept
of the university. Bringing together in
a giant academic corporation a great
many facilities and functions, the multi-
versity exists to serve the needs of
industry, the military, and the govern-
ment. (Recent riots at the University of
California by students on civil rights and
freedom to organise politically on the
campus have led to ironical references
to the “nulliversity”.)
The nearest approach to that of Dr
Kerr comes from the Vice-Chancellor
at the University of New South Wales,
Professor J. P. Baxter. In reply to ques-
tions from The Bulletin, he said: “I
am pleased to see that the Government
has rejected the proposals on the size of
universities, proposals which are com-
pletely out of line with enlightened think-
ing on this subject overseas and which,
had they been adopted, would have
crippled some Australian universities in
the years to come.”
The University of New South Wales
plans to develop to an ultimate size of
25,000 students, 15,000 full-time and the
rest part-time, post-graduate and others.
Honors or pass?
Tn any case how much are the problems
of universities a function of size,
and how much a function of their dif-
ficulties which are not due to size but
are exacerbated by it? For instance,
Associate* Professor H. Mayer at Sydney
University is doubtful about the Martin
report’s conclusions that the lack of
student-staff contacts is due only to size.
In the department of Government,
Mayer and others have tried to extend
the opportunities for staff student contact
on an informal basis but have found, for
an inexplicable reason, a wall of resist-
ance from the students. However many
opportunities were made available
students seemed reluctant to take ad-
vantage of them. “The main problem
seems to be in getting through to pass
students. There seems to be a clear
difference between honors and pass
students in this respect. Yet it is the pass
students who are supposed to be the
ones that feel most like ciphers. Well,
how do we uncipher them if when given
the chance they won’t take it?” asks
Mayer.
The most notable change in the last
few years ‘in Australian universities,
according to Mayer, is the fast-spreading
acceptance among undergraduates of the
need to get an honors degree and if
possible a post-graduate degree. It is
a definite and noticeable change. “There
is a very deep conviction that the BA is
no longer enough.” This feeling is borne
out by the Martin report’s findings that
while the number of bachelor degrees
awarded has risen by 67 per cent, the
number of higher degrees has increased
by 125 per cent.
It does not provide any figures for
honors degrees but says that, unlike
Britain, Australia has not had a great con-
troversy on whether the major academic
responsibility of the universities is to
“concentrate on a small elite capable of
reaching the highest possible grades of
honors, or whether their function is to
produce a stream of broadly educated
pass students”. It maintains that in Aus-
tralia the universities have to do both. In
fact, without the controversy there seems
to be a very strong undergraduate under-
tow pulling more and more students to
honors courses. The bigness of uni-
versities may even be partially assisting.
In universities like Sydney and Mel-
bourne being an honors student, especially
in the huge Arts faculties, is to be some-
one —to be a pass student is often to
be nobody, not just nobody in the
academic sense but in the social sense
as well tram to the university in the
morning, tram home at night, not very
much in between.
On university administration the re-
port recommends that there is an urgent
need for more permanent officers to ease
the work of the vice-chancellor, and a
general overhaul and streamlining of the
whole senior administration of universi-
ties. What is needed, it says, is an
examination of the professorial boards
at large universities and the faculties in
order to see if their work can be done
by smaller groups.
A comparison with the Robbins re-
port reveals the Martin report’s greatest
weakness and to some extent its greatest
strength. Unlike the Robbins report it
makes no recommendations of the sort
which would require a doubling in ten
years of the expenditure on university
education by the State and Federal
Governments. It does not recommend
the establishment of new universities; it
recommends against them. What it does
do, which in some ways gives it its dis-
tinctive strength, is to talk to the universi-
ties themselves, calling on them to think
of their own problems in a new way
not only what will it cost? But what
value does it have for the future of the
university?
The Martin report could have been
more specific in directing the expenditure
on universities by governments as dis-
tinct from the expenditure on tertiary
colleges. It could hardly have been more
specific in its pinpointing of the non-
physical problems of growth and develop-
ment facing the universities. , |, jj

testicles.”
“1 beg your pardon?”
“Bull’s testicles,” repeated the
Focxlmaster of the Friday Club. “Sauteed
in oil, then braised with olives in a rich
tomato paste with stock and various
herbs.” The other seven members reso-
lutely munched on. Eating and drinking
enthusiasts have strong stomachs and
high ambitions.
Today, eating and drinking societies
are proliferating all over Australia. Many
of the established ones have long waiting
lists, and this has produced others, which
in turn fill and have waiting lists, and
the cycle continues. Few records are
available (most clubs have a minimum of
bureaucracy and red tape), but I have
notes on over 110 dining organisations,
some of them with over 200 members.
The names themselves tell the story:
the Wine and Food Society, the Wine
and Food Club, Wine Lovers, Wine and
Cheese, Dine and Wine, Wine Tasters,
Chicken and Chablis, Escoffier, Eaters’
Club, Eaters and Drinkers, The Bacchus
Club, Beefsteak and Burgundy, and,
somewhat appropriately at the end of
this terminological feast, Les Femmes.
There are over 5000 members attending
the various functions regularly, and this
does not include the small private clubs.
So it is fairly obvious that per capita
Australia has more registered aspirants
to wine and food knowledge than any
other nation. And perhaps in the word
“aspirant” lies the key to the whole situa-
tion,4or this nation, so long classified by
the world as a culinary disaster area
(Australia: kangaroos and koalas, pies
and peas), is at last waking up to the
ideal that we eat importantly twice a day
every day of our lives, so we may as well
do it properly. And in doing it properly
we may eventually become sufficiently
cosmopolitan not to need Wine and Food
clubs. (Although which comes first
the Poularde a la D’Albufera or Les
Oeufs en Cocotte a la Strasbourgeoise?)
Wine clubs were a comparative novelty
when the Bacchus Club was formed in
Adelaide before the last war. Leading
members of the great wine-making
families and outstanding technical men
were concerned about “the woeful lack
of public and hotel trade knowledge of
the day” and started the club to bring
together lovers of wine, to encourage
greater use of fine wines by the public
and to try to obtain better service in
hotels and restaurants. Moving spirit
was Clifford Neil, of Quelltaler Wines,
and well-known wine-men on the first
committee were Mick Auld, Hurtle
Walker and Max Luff. A tribute to the
health-giving qualities of the grape is
that they are all still very active mem-
bers. From a basic nucleus of trade
identities, the club has now spread to six
branches with over 540 members, and
includes a wide cross-section of business
and professional men. Understandably,
since South Australia is the major wine-
producing State, food is relegated to
second place, although one branch, the
Barossa Bacchus Club, has a reputation
as a bunch of gourmets through the in-
fluence of their foodmaster, Alf Wark,
of Yalumba. Significantly, masked tast-
ings are rarely held. Famous wine man
Tony Nelson claims: “It just turns every-
thing into a guessing contest,” and this
view is held by many others.
The Wine and Food Society of New
South Wales is the senior club in that
State. It was originated in 1938 and one
of the foundation members was Johnny
Walker, famed wine-merchant, leading
Sydney restaurateur and one of the best
food merchandisers in Australia today.
He says: “Four of us used to meet in
the old Rhinecastle Bistro for a lunch
together to talk about wine and food.
Henri Renault, Maurice O’Shea, Gilbert
Phillips and myself. Slowly this swelled
to twelve people; we even had to extend
the table twice. I've still got it. Then
we decided to form the Wine and Food
Society. For another couple of years we
met in the Bistro until it got to 50 mem-
bers and we had to move out. Jeanne
and Henri Renault did the cooking
it was fabulous. We used to charge
3s. 6d. for a darn good three-course
meal PLUS the wine, and some of the
members complained that we were
making a profit. As far as I'm con-
cerned, they were the days. I don’t
go very often now. I'd like to, but I’m
just too darn busy.”
Today there are 170 members. They
lunch weekly, have a monthly wine
tasting conducted by Winemaster Rudy
Komon, which is regarded as being the
best of its kind, and put on other dinners,
some of which include lady guests. Other
branches of the society have been formed
in Griffith, Cessnock, Newcastle, South-
ern Districts and Brisbane.
In Melbourne the Wine and Food
Society preceded the Sydney one by a
couple of years, and was followed by
societies in Ballarat, Ararat, Bendigo,
Geelong, Mildura and Warrnambool. A
Melbourne member recently said that
the older clubs were now a little too
conservative, and that the younger ones,
particularly Geelong, had a brighter
approach that was of more benefit to
the members. These clubs, including the
Bacchus Club of South Australia, are
all affiliated with the Wine and Food
Society in London, under the presidency
of the G.O.M. of wine, M. Andre Simon.
Older than all of these is the Viti-
cultural Society of Victoria, formed by

MASTER-KEYED SYSTEMS
A Master-Keyed System Is one in which each
.lock has its own individual key,, which oper-
ates that lock only and no other, but where
each lock is also built to a Master-Key which
will open all locks in the group.
Within a Master-Keyed System, if required,
certain locks may be grouped in a section
Keyed-Alike to a given Service-Key, and still
subject to. the Master-Key.

GRAND MASTER-KEYED SYSTEM
Each lock has its own individual key which
operates that lock only and no other, but the
locks are divided into two or more groups,
Each group is subject to its own Master-Key,
which opens all locks in that group, but ne
other group.
However, all locks are also subject to a
Grand Master-Key which opens all' locks irt
all groups.
As with Master-Keyed Systems, Keyed-Alike
groups may also be included in G.M.K. Systems,

is discussed. For years the parent body
of the luncheon club was the governing
body of wine in Victoria, and in 1961
when the name was changed to Wine and
Brandy Producers’ Association, the club
was allowed to retain the old title. The
membership stands at around 50 men
and they have a considerable cellar which
is kept in different places. All wines are
tasted blind, that is, in unidentifiable
bottles. Even the practice of wrapping
bottles to mask them is not permitted
here, for the members feel that too many
bottle shapes are known. Instead, the
wines are decanted into numbered cham-
pagne bottles and all members start from
scratch. Much discussion takes place
although Doug Seabrook, one of the
cellarmasters, says: ‘‘Generally speak-
ing, there is too much food, too much
wine, and not enough thought.”
Equally dedicated, but smaller, is the
Heidelberg Wine Club, limited to four-
teen members who take turns to cook for
the others. The chef of the day selects
the wines, masks them and is rewarded
for his efforts by listening to the mis-
takes of the others, each commenting in
turn.
More evangelical, perhaps more cheer-
ful, certainly less . knowledgeable and
probably less pretentious, is the Beef-
steak and Burgundy Club, the fastest-
growing of all the eating and drinking
organisations. This was originated by
Dick Clark and David Crosby in Adelaide
in 1954. Dick, the general manager of
"Hardys Tintara Wines, and long-time
secretary of the Bacchus Club, thought
that the latter was getting too big, and
was therefore failing in its object of
getting the “message” across. Besides,
there was a waiting list. So he got the
idea of different clubs that would operate
under the same charter but which would
be limited to 30 members each. The
movement has grown in a little more
than ten years to 55 clubs, represented
in each State of the Commonwealth, the
Northern Territory, New Guinea, and
most recently, in London, under the
auspices of Ken Jarvie, a Trade Com-
missioner who was a Sydney member.
Though roughly linked, each club has
its own committee which includes the
wine and food masters. Some clubs meet
monthly in the same spot, some even
have the same menu! In other cases it
is the foodmaster’s job to move them
around and he is often subject to abuse.
The wines are mostly masked, sometimes
not. Members are chosen to comment,
and have to make some sort of reply.
This does much to dispense with pre-
tension, for humility is less apparent
when members can choose when to speak
up or shut up. Even so, comments are
forthright, and in the best, or worst,
Australian tradition, generally more
critical than not. It is then the master’s
job to sum up, and the critics are either

praised or taken to task for their com-
ments. Though there are many wine
trade identities in the various clubs, lay-
men predominate and are eager to learn.
The standard of the w'ines is generally
high, and Australian wines predominate.
In addition to the monthly luncheons,
ladies’ nights are held and feature
functions evolved. The level of en-
thusiasm is high, yet some people are
still wary of these clubs. One noted
wine judge openly scoffs every time the
name is mentioned, and the dedicated
Seabrook, though full of praise for the
movement as 1 a whole, doubts their
ultimate value. He says: “They have
the Loyal Toast after the first red’ so
they can have a smoke! No other club
in Victoria does the same thing.” (Per-
'haps the attitude of the Beefsteak and
Burgundy boys is best expressed by Jim
Hardy, who, when asked to sum-up on
a wine after much learned comment,
said: “Well, it’s very easy on the gums!”
and sat down.)
This attitude is apparent among some
of the smaller clubs. The Eaters and
Drinkers, a Sydney club dominated by
advertising personnel, P.R.O’s and journ-
alists, was formed w'ith two objects in
mind. They disliked the pretensions of
other groups, and the fact that females
were barred. So the company of this
group is__mixed. They mostly talk of
other things, though they enjoy the W'ine
and food. Their motto is: “The Analysis
of Pleasure Destroys Enjoyment”.
In approving mixed company, perhaps
they are setting a trend, for like the
nation, nearly every club is now for men
only. One exception is the Strathalbyn
Wine and Food Club and there may he
others. This male domination prompted
a female revolt in South Australia, and
in 1956 the Chicken and Chablis Club
was formed in Adelaide which bars men.
The form is much the same, how'ever,
except that, understandably, more
emphasis is placed on table decoration
and settings. Then, in 1961, Les Femmes
was born, with the astounding require-
ment that there be no ladies under 40
years admitted. Men jubilantly stated
that this would mean no members. But
the club has prospered, and today, like
the Chicken and Chablis Club, has a
waiting list.
There are many others. Some are
entities begun by ardent spirits which are
happily self-sufficient. The Canberra
Wine Club was formed at a time when
the wine supplies to the capital were
inadequate. Not only did they wish to
hold the usual kind of function but also
to get wines for their members. Even
this was not enough for the leading
spirit, John Cruickshank, who saw no
reason why they should not have their
own building. So they built one. Other
clubs start singly and then spread locally,
like the Epicurean Clubs of the River
areas of South Australia. Many contain
members of other clubs who apparently
find meetings too infrequent and band
together to form yet another club.
The Chevron Friday Club is an
example of this, for each one of the
eight members belongs to other clubs,
in some cases two or even more. This
group began casually four years ago,
grew to eight members, and then decided
to stop expanding since eight was con-
sidered the ideal conversational number.
It combines the characteristics of most
of the other clubs. There is equal atten-
tion between wine and food. All wines
are masked and each member is com-
pelled to comment in turn on both. The
dedication level is high, for among the
eight are three wine judges, four wine
or food professionals, five major office
bearers of other clubs, seven who own
their own cellars, and oil have judged
different food competitions. The food
is superb, since Tony Bohdan, the cater-
ing manager of the Chevron, takes it as
a personal matter of pride and some-
how finds time to re-create dishes from
all parts of the .world from local
materials. Bohdan is considered by many
to be the top food expert in Australia.
For all this, the Friday Club is un-
doubtedly the rudest bunch of egotists
extraordinary to be found, who con-
tinually attempt to score off the others
and delight in the ensuing verbal ping-
pong. There is a sort of unofficial stand-
in list of other identities who replace
absent members and their initial embar-
rassment is apparently quite alarming.
Yet the Friday Club has done much to
set food standards and the members still
learn, and enjoy, and enjoy learning.
Standards can be set with wine, too.
The First Thursday Club is composed of
top wine men, responsible for production
in some of our greatest wine companies,
and therefore aggressive rivals, who meet
monthly with prominent amateurs, wine
merchants and retailers. They taste
wines, discuss public tastes and trends,
exchange knowledge, technological ad-
vances, different viewpoints, and still
enjoy each other's company.
How much pretension is there? Lots,
according to one very senior member of
a very senior club. “Snobbery? Of course
there is. People carry on alarmingly
about wine and food. But what does it
matter? There’s snobbery in all things—
cars, houses, positions, everything. It’s
just more evident when people carry on
about wine and food, and as they learn
more they realise how little they know.”
This is a valid point. People who use
the words “intimate”; “coy”, “light-
hearted”, to describe wine are generally
going through an impressionable phase
and use the words to cover lack of know-


ledge. Among top wine men you never
hear these phrases except in jest. This
somewhat precious image that outsiders
occasionally have would be quickly dis-
pelled by contact with the typical*
W. & F. man, who is almost Elizabethan
in attitude.
A general restaurant and hotel attitude
to these clubs is best expressed by the
general manager of Chevron, Frank
Christie, who only a few years ago drank
scotch with his meals and who can now
cheerfully tilt at a masked bottle with the
best of them. He says: “To start with,
these clubs give their members a great
deal of pleasure. There’s a lot of pom-
posity/and snobbery, but it’s good PR,
good business and good exercise. Last
year alone we had 67 different functions
from them.”
So there it is. Few doubt that the
clubs have greatly benefited appreciation
of both wine and food. Many claim they
are the prime reason for the greatly in-
creased standards in both. Some are
critical of the pretension, snobbery and
connoisseurship that exist, but even most
of these are aware this belongs to a
minority and doesn’t really matter that
much.
Tortured in Istanbul
While Hassan laughed
By DAVID MCNICOLL
Having a Turkish bath in Istanbul
is an experience calling for
physical fitness and the sort of
voluntary endurance displayed by monks
in the days when hair shirts were stan-
dard apparel.
The establishment to which I was
despatched was the GALATASARAY,'
said to be the best in Istanbul, and
recently rebuilt at a cost of 1+ million
Turkish lira (about £75,000). It lies at the
end of an unprepossessing cobbled street
(but what street isn’t cobbled in Istan-
bul?) and its modest door belies its
magnificent interior.
They were lying in wait for me, those
young Turks, all contenders for the pen-
tathlon at the Olympics, or to be extras
in James Bond films. One of the fittest,
Hassan, had been detailed to supervise
my torture. He led me to a cubicle with
two divans in it, handed me a thin, gaily-
colored cotton lap-lap, and indicated
that when I was undressed I should pre-
sent myself again in the ante-room.
This I did, and emerged to the quite
apparent buzz of interest from the at-
tendants when they saw —no, not my
physique—my summer Bondi suntan.
Hassan then led me into the main
heat room. This was a marble affair,
round, and not unlike a small mosque.
It had a domed roof with 51 small,
opaque windows which I was able to
count and recount as I lay on the round
central marble table, on a towel which
Hassan had placed there, making me
comfortable by putting a shallow basin,
upturned, under my head.
There is no steam, as such, in this
chamber. The slab on which you lie is
very hot towards the centre, varying to
lukewarm on the outer perimeters. The
effect of lying on the warm stone is re-
markably pleasant, and the body heats
almost imperceptibly. After about twenty
minutes I had broken into a gentle sweat.
Hassan reappeared, ran his finger along
my arm, shook his head and disappeared
again. My only companions in the room
had finished their sweating, and were
involved in the assisted washing cere-
monial at the huge marble basins ring-
ing the walls. There is none of the naked
braggadocio which one might see in a
men's athletic club in the Western world.
The Turks are most modest and reticent,
and as they walked about, or were
washed, they deftly covered themselves
with a small piece of towelling.
When Hassan decided that I was
“done”, he started his massage. It was
a magnificent rub, but : ts roughness was
a shock for the uninitiated. He knelt
alongside the marble table, and put the
full force of his weight and strength in-
to the manipulation of leg and arm
muscles. Then he probed my eye-
sockets, presumably experimenting to
see how far back my eyeballs would go
before they burst. Then he picked up
my legs by the big toes, and waggled
them gaily from side to side. When he
turned me over I was almost ready for
anything, but not for. the mighty whack
on my spine which set my vertebrae off
like a Christmas cracker. Hassan then
made a valiant attempt to separate my
head from my body by the simple ex-
pedient of pulling it off. Foiled in this,
he turned to pummeling, and gave me a
workout with jabs to the ribs which
would have brought misty delight to
Rocky Gattellari’s eyes.
When I was reduced to an impotent
blubber, Hassan smiled at me in what
he no doubt regarded as a winning way,
wrapped another towel round me, and
motioned that I was to rest for a while.
But not for long. In ten minutes the
Turkish torturer reappeared, bearing a
basin and some weird implements, and
motioned me to follow him to the private
washroom where my agonies would be
observed only by one or two characters.
Hassan got me to test the hot water,
and when I approved the temperature,
he filled the monster basin. Then water
started to cascade on me. As I was splut-
tering he fell on me with a huge hunk
of soap and started soaping me all
over. Then more water to wash it off.
Then more soap. While I was enjoying a
moment's respite he put his hand inside
a large sort of magic mitt pot scourer.
Then he was at me again with this
excruciating device, rubbing as much
skin as possible from my body in deep,
hard strokes. It is no exaggeration to
say that the pain was very considerable.
If I winced, he rubbed harder, laughing
into my eyes like that Turk in “Lawrence
of Arabia” who held O’Toole while the
other Turks belted him. Of this scrub-
bing, let me say only that next day my
back was so tender I could not lie down.
So it went on. He discarded the pot
scourer for a sort of mop, which he
slopped in a bowl of lather and rubbed
all over me. After the magic mitt it felt
delightful. Finally came the washdown,
the water gradually tapering off in tem-
perature. Then Hassan bowed and left
me, while a series of towel boys ap-
peared, swathed me all over, and led me
to a cooling room. There I was rubbed
dry, and more fresh towels wrapped
round me (they used ten in the whole
morning's operating). Then I was led
back to my cubicle, where I stretched
out and a lackey brought a steaming
cup of Turkish coffee.
As I lay there, a feeling of magnificent
well-being started to come over me. Has-
san's beating and scrubbing and man-
handling were all forgotten. I only knew
that I felt terrific. I dressed, paid the
bill (about 15/- plus tips) and went
out of the baths walking on air.
But I left my Bondi suntan behind.
It came off in Hassan’s magic mitt.

“To do business around the world I needed an
airline that flew everywhere. That’s why I tried
Pan Am. That’s why I’ve stuck with Pan Am.”
-—says Mr. Harold Porter, Packaging Exporter, of Melbourne
“I do a lot of flying ’round the world
and every time I take a trip on Pan
Am I learn something new. My
most recent trip took me through
the U.S., Britain, Scandinavia, and
the Far East. 1 learned that Pan
Am flies straight through to Europe,
not just from New York, but from
major U.S. cities like Detroit, Chi-
cago, Seattle and San Francisco
17 cities in all. That kind of con-
venience is invaluable to a business-
man in a hurry.”
Businessmen'fly Pan Am every-
where. With good reason. Pan Am
has a wealth of experience with the
needs of businessmen. And it puts
that experience to work. In arrang-
ing reservations, making quick con-
nections, planning itineraries, and in
seeing to it that in-flight service
covers a businessman’s every re-
quirement. That’s why Pan Am has
won a worldwide reputation among
businessmen. Why not find out for
yourself? All you have to do is call
your Pan Am Travel Agent. Or call

Fanny, Bessie and Connie
“It Will not escape the reader’s notice ...”
By GORDON HAWKINS
book,” said the Attorney-
General, “deals with what every-
body will recognise as an un-
savory subject gratification of the
sexual appetite.” Sir Thomas Inskip was
leading for the Crown in the successful
prosecution of William Heinemann Ltd
for publishing “Bessie Cotter” by Wal-
lace Smith. That was 30 years ago and
it is commonly cited as a singularly crass
remark. But despite current cant about
“the sexual revolution”, Sir Thomas’s
evaluation of the popular attitude to sex
is not without relevance to public
opinion even today.
Bessie Cotter moreover was neither the
first nor the last literary heroine to be
tried in the English courts. As it happens
reports of two more recent prosecutions
became generally available in Australia
last week. In one instance —the publi-
cation of an Australian edition of C. H.
Rolph's “The Trial of Lady Chatterley”
—this has not gone unnoticed in the
Press and elsewhere. The coincidental
appearance in the same week of “The
‘Fanny Hill’ Case” in the form of an
Appendix to H. Montgomery Hyde’s “A
History of Pornography” (Heinemann,
31s. 6d.) has as yet occasioned no com-
ment. Yet the coincidence may serve to
draw attention to certain significant
features common to both trials.
Thus Rolph’s choice of a title for what
is in fact an edited transcript of Regina
V. Penguin Books Ltd (1960) was not
fortuitous. Indeed he says, in his Intro-
duction, that it was “not D. H. Lawrence,
or Penguin books, who was on trial...
It was a fifteenth-century trial for adul-
tery, Constance Chatterley was there in
Court, the Scarlet Letter must somewhere
be ready”. As a matter of fact he rather
overdoes this point about “putting her
Ladyship on trial as adulteress”. He
intervenes for example to say such things
as “It will not escape the reader’s notice
that, in a trial concerned with obscenity
and its possible justification by literary
merit, the whole of this colloquy had
been concerned with the question, univer-
sal as it is in world literature, of adul-
tery.” Whereas the italicised words
might suggest that such an interpolation
was superfluous.
There is little doubt, however, that it
was Lady Chatterley (rather than the
gamekeeper, be it noted) who was on
trial. This comes out very clearly in
numberless passages in Mr Griffith-
Jones’ cross-examination of witnesses.
But her real offence seems to have been
not so much adultery as the fact that
she sought “the satisfaction of her sexual
lust” and was a good deal too much
concerned with “pleasure, satisfaction
and sensuality”. As Mr Griffith-Jones
said, the main theme of the book
appeared to be “the search and import-
ance of finding somebody with whom
you can have satisfactory sexual inter-
course”. And in this extremely able
closing address he asked, “What is there
in this book to suggest that if the sexual
intercourse between Lady Chatterley and
Mellors had not eventually turned out
to be successful she would not have gone
on and on and on elsewhere until she
did find it?” Note the italicised word;
there is significantly no suggestion that
Mellors would have engaged in a similar
tireless search. Yet in the novel he is
no less interested in the matter than his
mistress.
When we come to the “Fanny Hill”
case once again one cannot help feeling
that it was John Cleland’s heroine who
was on trial rather than the ostensible
defendant —a London firm of booksel-
lers. “She virtually never goes out of the
house, does she?” said Mr Griffith-Jones
who again (this time successfully)
appeared for the Director of Public Pro-
secutions. At another point he asked
Mr Peter Quennell, who testified as an
authority on the literary, political and
social aspects of eighteenth century
England, “She quite enjoyed the flagel-
lation in the end?” Mr Quennell
acknowledged that she had enjoyed it
more than she expected, but added that
she did not approve. Yet he admitted
that “Fanny’s insistence upon her own
pleasure, quite apart from that of her
lover's pleasure” was one of the most
striking features of the book.
It is clear, incidentally, that the real
objection to “Bessie Cotter” was along
somewhat similar lines. Not that she
writhes about in ecstasy or is as obsessed
with what Lawrence calls “orgasmic
satisfaction” as the other ladies. But
she appears to enjoy her work as a Chi-
cago prostitute. And this cuts right
across conventional theories as to what
prostitutes ought to be and think. Instead
of being trapped, drugged, brutally
treated or tragically miserable she is a
cheerful character who prefers her job
in a “parlour house” to any available
alternative.
Of course there are a considerable
number of important differences between
Constance Chatterley and Fanny Hill.
As a matter of fact an amusing aspect
of the matter is the way in which defence
witnesses in the latter case went out of
their way to speak slightingly or imply
disapproval of the Lawrentian view ,of
the sex act as “something sacred ... an
act of holy communion”. Peter Quen-
nell’s view for example was that “Fanny
Hill would have shuddered at Lady
Chatterley”. In comparing the treatment
of sexual intercourse in the two novels
he said, “I do not think Lawrence is any
less explicit and there is a preaching
tendency which makes him far more
offensive. I think that Cleland is cheer-
fully straightforward whereas Lawrence
is muddled and sentimental”.
Nevertheless, they have in common
two things which are in this context cru-
cial. In the first place they are both
women. Peter Quennell’s suggestion that
the fact that “Fanny Hill” is told from
the woman’s viewpoint “represents per-
haps a step in the emancipation of the

opposite sex” is not altogether fantastic.
It is notable that by far the most effec-
tive defence witness in the case was a
woman authoress, Marghanita Laski. “It
is a jolly book,” she said and she drew
attention to the fact that Cleland
“stressed women’s pleasure”. In the
Lady Chatterley case Mr Griffith-Jones’
much quoted question “Is it a book that
you would wish your wife or your ser-
vants to read?” is usually cited as showing
him to be ludicrously out of touch with
the realities of existence for the ordinary
juror who would be most unlikely to
have any servants. But surely it is the
view of the position of women implied
in the question which is of greater signi-
ficance.
]yj[R Grfffith-Jones seems in fact to be
rather uneasy about women alto-
gether. Thus he asked Miss Sarah Jones,
the classics mistress at a girls' grammar
school, “Do you have any real doubt
that within a week of this book having
been published every girl in your school
will have read it. and every girl perhaps
in every other school?” Miss Jones re-
plied soberly that she had “the greatest
doubts on that”. Gerald Gardiner, QC,
who appeared for the defence in the
Lady Chatterley case, on the other hand
seems to rather like women. Indeed
C. H. Rolph suggests that his rejection
of some male jurors (one of whom was
replaced by a woman) was motivated by
a desire to get more women on the
jury.
The other thing which Lady Chatterley
and Fanny Hill have in common is of
course the fact that they both enjoy sex.
Indeed they carry on rather excessively
(and unrealistically one might add) about
it. It seems likely that it is this, rather
than the four letter words or the fear
that people will immediately go off and
have sexual intercourse after reading
the books, that has disturbed many
readers. It is probable that the idea of
female sexual enjoyment is still deeply
offensive to many people. “Ladies don't
move,” Lord Curzon is said to have re-
marked. Perhaps they are more mobile
than they used to be. but one gets the
impression from reading these trials that
some persons at any rate find this
development rather alarming. One is
reminded of some words of Oliver St
John Gogarty during a debate on a
censorship bill in the Irish Senate many
years ago. “It is high time,” said
Gogarty, “the people of this country
found some other way of loving God,
than by hating women.” There are rea-
sons for thinking that remark may have
some relevance to the situation in this
country where, although we can now
read accounts of their trials, both the
ladies under discussion are prohibited
from making a personal appearance.

Memo to a Bishop
The Americans’ nobility in Vietnam
Coffins carrying Americans killed in Vietnam returning home.
By ANTHONY BROWN
HPhe Second Indo-China War, that con-
flict remote for so long from essential
European interests, has become a local
war which may and probably will
become the testing ground of wills be-
tween the world's two great ideologies.
For at .last the Americans have shown
themselves determined to face the proba-
bility of extensive, bloody landwar in
Asia with the main protagonists being the
Eagle and the Dragon. Anyone who has
been to South Vietnam, who has seen and
lived with the murderous nature of war-
fare there, will doubtless agree with the
Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies,
that the American decision is Korea
apart the most noble act of courage
in international affairs since Britain’s
decision to stand alone against Germany
in 1940.
So far the toll of American lives has
not been heavy. Between January 1,
1961, and April 12, 1965, 2535 Ameri-
cans have been killed, wounded, cap-
tured and missing, whereas South Viet-
namese casualties have been of the order
of 35,000 men a year with myriads of
uncounted dead. The American price
will from now on inevitably v become
greater, for the Communist bloc rejection
of President Johnson’s offer for un-
conditional peace talks can mean only
a widening of the war and the com-
mittal of vastly reinforced combat
groups. It seems ironic that the churches
have started to concern themselves at
a time when, after five years of kid-glove
warfare and patient exploration for a
political settlement, the United States
has been compelled by the Communists
themselves to widen the war. The
churches’ concern appears to have de-
veloped along ill-informed, ill-advised
attempts to spearhead the disengagement
of Australia from a conflict which is
vital to the destinies of Oceania.
Mr Cabot Lodge must have been
relieved indeed when Sir Robert, with
an admirable blend of the peremptory
and the courteous, firmly committed
Australia to the American side. For it
is an inescapable fact, as was Korea, that
the Communists caused this war and if
they dislike napalm, high explosive,
American troops on Asian soil and the
use of a gas which dods little more than
cause illness not unlike morning sickness,
then they have only themselves to blame.
The fact is America has advanced into
this war with caution, restraint and in-
telligence, not to mention extraordinary
bravery and dedication, against a
murderous and subtle enemy, and the
American Army lists are littered with

An extraordinary fact seems to have
escaped the churches and the student
bodies bodies which do themselves
little credit by slamming the American
stand at a time when it is virtually the
main battlefield for the colliding
ideologies. This fact is that not only has
Red China made available to Ho Chi-
minh war material and political support
on an ever-increasing scale since the end
of World War 11, but there is strong
reason to believe that Chinese ground
forces have been involved in operations
south of the Seventeenth Parallel for at
least a year.
Soldiers are not politicians —certainly
not those soldiers of the calibre the
Americans are employing in South Viet-
nam —and therefore they have neither
the equipment nor the time for propa-
ganda. So that when I was told by
Special Forces commanders at Pleiku
and Hue that they have heard commands
being shouted in Chinese above the
rattle of battle, 1 am prepared to believe
them. No Chinese prisoners have yet
been taken, but bodies of Chinese serving
with the Vietcong have been found.
Captured documentation shows that
Chinese theoreticians, strategists, intelli-
gence and propaganda officers, all have
been involved in the direction of the
Vietcong in South Vietnam. Chinese
radar (with Chinese technicians) has been
established in North Vietnam to orien-
tate North Vietnamese fighter patrols:
masses of Chinese war material have
been captured, fast Chinese blockade
runners have been intercepted in the
South China Sea and large numbers of
North Vietnamese fighting men have
been trained in South China. The
identity of equipment and tactics be-
tween the North Vietnamese armed
forces and the Chinese is almost total.
Apologists for Chinese involvement
state that those Chinese presently fight-
ing with the Vietcong have been drawn
from the 1,300,000 overseas Chinese at
present living in North Vietnam. Even if
this were entirely true the fact is in-
escapable that, wherever there is a Chin-
ese diplomatic mission, on the staff there
is a Vietcong official, or whole miss : ons
of the National Liberation Front of South
Vietnam. These missions have already
been identified in Algiers, where the
Vietcong maintains its largest diplomatic
mission in the non-C'ommunist world,
and in Cairo, Prague, Peking and Mos-
cow. So that the apologists’ contentions
can be disposed of accurately by the
accepted Western diplomatic contention
that without Chinese assistance the Viet-
cong could not have emerged as the
threat that it is today.

developing the line that US air raids in
Vietnam had encouraged the National
Liberation Front to step up its offensive.
They are insisting that US efforts to
compel the Vietcong to negotiate will
not succeed, and that negotiations can
only take place when US forces have
been withdrawn from South Vietnam.
On the critical issue of the request for
Chinese- assistance National Liberation
Front diplomats are insisting that this
will only be permitted provided opera-
tional control remains with the Vietcong.
Since the Americans cannot withdraw
from South Vietnam without the total
collapse of the entire Western position
in South-East Asia, this Vietcong pre-
condition withers the prospect of im-
mediate peace upon the vine, and it
seems obvious that the Chinese will
involve themselves when they want to
and how they want to, whatever the
Vietcong does or says.
The world seems now to be expecting
one of those cataclysmic encounters
which have marked Sino-American rela-
tions since the end of World War 11.
American morality in its international
affairs can often be disputed. But not
in the present crisis. American dis-
engagement would be fatal for both
Britain and Australia but, as usual, the
American cause is being attacked by a
persuasive propaganda campaign on a
global scale. In the past this campaign
has brought the Americans into contempt
for lack of determination in the prosecu-
tion of the Indo-China War. Now it is
having the effect of presenting the
American case as one of unmitigated
aggression. As one American diplomat
said with despair in Saigon to me: “We
just cannot bloody well win. can we?”
In the age of the sit-in, sit-down and
sit-out, this may very well be true. But,
unlike Saigon, student opinion and
clerical interference are only remote
factors of government, so that Envoy
Extraordinary Lodge—and the American
Government must feel intense relief
that at this critical, confused and vague
moment in South-East-Asian affairs the
Traditional Alliance is re-forming once
again to meet Communist imperialism.
For if the Americans suffered mightily
and bloodily at Korea, it should also be
remembered that so did China. China
lost the flower of her army south of the
Yalu, and the prospect of losing -yet
another flower south of the Seventeenth
is, no doubt, making Peking examine
the future with “wonderful clarity”.
This time, however, China has very
much more to lose: her new nuclear
weapons industry. There can be no
doubt that, faced with Chinese intran-
sigence, American contingency planning
has taken care of the necessity of
eliminating these targets.

The Lone Arab
Bourguiba’s gesture to Israel
By EMERY BARCS
T>resident Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia
•*- has come a long way from his
intransigent anti-Israeli attitude of four
years ago. In May, 1961. in New York,
at a lunch held in his honor by the UN
SecretaryTJeneral he said, inter alia,
that the dispute between Israel and her
Arab neighbors cannot be solved by
negotiations and that the problem of
Palestine will be solved by war. Recently
in an interview with a correspondent of
the Left-wing Paris weekly, “Le NouveL
Observateur”, Bourguiba insisted that
“we must not say we want to throw the
Jews into the sea if we cannot do it.
And not to say it any longer would be
a start toward helping find a means of co-
existence with them”.
President Bourguiba has made his sane
suggestion at a moment when the 17-
year-old Arab-Israeli conflict is heading
towards a new crisis on account of Arab
plans to divert the Jordan waters which,
the Jews assert, are essential for their
survival. There has been considerable
rattling of old and of newly acquired
military hardware on both sides. Some
Middle East experts assert that a direct
Arab assault on Israel is now unlikely
because a large part of the Egyptian
army is bogged down in Egypt, the
Irakis have their hands full with military
operations against the Kurds, Syria is
quarrelling with its Arab neighbors and
Lebanon is as anxious as ever to keep
out of trouble. But what would happen
if Israel tried to stop Jordan from drying
up the Jewish water-supplies is anybody's
guess.
So far reactions to Bourguiba’s
remarks have been restricted to a few,

Who discovered SINGAPORE?
We did! The travel agent started it by explaining it wouldn’t cost a penny
more to stop-over in Singapore, on our way to Europe. On those terms who
would miss the chance to go on a voyage of discovery!
So we came to Singapore. The friendly, cosmopolitan people welcomed us
to their fascinating country and we were set fair to uncover an array of
spectacle and excitement that gave real meaning to the saying—‘You see
more of the Orient in Singapore.’ Take a glimpse at this magical island
with us and you too will be taking the first steps towards discovering wonder-
ful Singapore.
SHOPPING like Aladdin's Caves! You name it—
they've got it here, and at prices that make you feel like a king! Singapore
is a duty-free port and that means you can buy the whole world's luxuries
at prices that put the fun back into shopping. Cameras, transistor radios,
rare fabrics, jewellery, and works of art from all over the Orient. All this
and you buy in the friendliest surroundings imaginable. When you get off
the beaten track there’s a lot of laughs to be had by bargaining for what
you purchase.
What could we do when we were offered a 2 band, 8 transistor portable for
A£6! We bought it! And lots of similar bargains: now we can’t stop con-
gratulating ourselves.

undoubtedly organised, outbursts of mob-
violence. His effigy was burned in some
places including Baghdad and Beirut. But
top-ranking Arab leaders have kept sur-
prisingly mum about them.
Bourguiba is too experienced in Middle
East politics to stick out his neck without
at least some hope of support for his
very careful move to achieve Arab-
Israeli co-existence. Among the neutra-
lists his most valuable backers would be
those African states which have main-
tained close economic relations with
Israel for years. President Tito of Yugo-
slavia may also lend a useful hand. As
Bourguiba said, Tito refused to in-
clude Palestine among the countries
under “colonial domination”. “That,”
added Tito, “confirmed my long time
impression that in the Israel affair the
Arabs find resistance among their best
friends.”
If as a result of the Tunisian Presi-
dent s initiative a Middle East peace
offensive were launched the main outside
opposition to it would no longer come
from Moscow but from Peking. The
Kremlin leaders seem to have made up
their minds that for the time being they
cannot much further increase their in-
fluence in the area. Relations between
Turkey and Iran, the two pro-Western
countries of the region, and the Soviet
Union have much improved lately and
this in turn has decreased Moscow’s
need to pander uncritically to Arab am-
bitions. On the other hand Red China
is hard at work to keep the Middle East
in a feverish state. During his recent
visit to Cairo (as an afterthought of going
to the funeral of Rumania’s Gheorghiu-
Dej) Premier Chou En-lai has allegedly
made promises of considerable Red
Chinese aid to the leaders of the Palesti-
nian Liberation Front.
The crucial point is of course that with
a minimum of goodwill on both sides
the Arab-Israeli conflict could be liqui-
dated in no time. Experts assert that the
difference between the Israeli and the
Arab schemes for the exploitation of the
Jordan waters is hardly more than 10
per cent of the water-flow. The exodus
of some 500,000 Jews from the Arab
countries to Israel has largely balanced
Arab refugees from Palestine who
number about 580,000 and who could
be easily absorbed by Middle East coun-
tries if the Arab leaders ceased to use
them as “martyrs” to justify their hate-
Israel campaign. Such resettlement pro-
grammes would be entirely financed by
the United Nations (in fact, mainly by
the US) and by Israel itself.
Bourguiba’s lone Arab voice may still
be lost in the vast desert of. arid Israeli
hatreds among his kinsmen. On the
other hand his probing initiative has
created an opening, small as it may be,
which is surely worth trying to widen.


KNOPFELMACHER
The “Jewish cosmopolitan”?
By SAM LIPSKI
Well, 1 have got a very high
regard for Karl Marx. 1 think
that Karl Marx was one of
the greatest sociological thinkers. But I
think one has to regard Marxist philo-
sophy as a separate issue unconnected
with Communism. 1 feel that if Karl
Marx were alive today and if he fell
into the clutches of the Communist
secret police he would probably be exe-
cuted as a Jewish cosmopolitan, or
something like that. He wouldn’t survive
very long. Marx was a man with a
passionate concern for freedom and
human dignity and 1 always separate in
my lectures and in my seminars—l go
out of my way to separate —Karl Marx
the thinker, the sociological investigator
from the sort of thing that was made out
of Marx by his Communist so-called
followers. It’s like judging Christ or St
Paid on the activities of the Renaissance
Popes.
Q.: And is this how you see yourself
now? —as a Jewish cosmopolitan with
belief in. . . .
A.: Well, I am now an Australian by
adoption; I’m certainly Jewish, my Jew-
ishness plays a very important part in
my life, and I have always felt a certain
amount of personal affinity to Marx.
Yes / did—he is one of the figures I
like in the history of thought. /
If the interviewer, Gerald Lyons,
seemed unaware of the overtones of
“Jewish cosmopolitan”, the interviewee,
Frank Knopfelmacher, certainly was not,
for it had been a week of overtones,
blatant, subtle and ironic.
The exchange came at the end of an
interview on ABV-2’s “People” in which
Dr Knopfelmacher, with the assistance
of Lyons who by now recognises good
“copy” when he sees it, had been able
to present his demand for justice to be
done and for the decision rejecting his
recommended appointment to Sydney
University to be rescinded.
One can only wonder how he came
across into the homes of those who are
not academics, students or politically in-
volved: the accent, yet the flowing torrent
of words; the emphasis on abstract ideas
and principles, yet the earthy, sometimes
shocking, concrete examples; the serious-
ness of the issues, yet the brutal simplic-
ity with which he put them; all com-
bined with the appearance of a kindly
old music teacher and the manner of a
tough politician.
It was certainly a confident, uncom-
promising, and impressive public face
which he presented, though privately he
admits, still seemingly without senti-
mentality, that it has been a harrowing
time. “Ah, well, you see, I have become
the object of my own predictions.” Hfs
friends say that, whatever his public pos-
ture, he has been deeply shaken, as
much by his concern at how the continu-
ing tension of battling and struggling will
affect his wife, Jarka. as by his own dis-
appointment that Sydney University
should have fulfilled his most extreme
prophesies.
The television appearance had come
at the end of a wearying day of answer-
ing questions from the Press and keeping
up with the slowly growing undercur-
rent of opinion moving toward him from
fellow academics, supporters and oppon-
ents alike; all this on the telephone.
For it is the telephone rather than
television. or even the Press which is
Frank Knopfelmacher's true medium of
mass communication, to the pleasure and
occasional annoyance of his friends,
especially when his best and most urgent
ideas come, as they often do, at night,
late at night.
Even so, there is usually pleasure
despite the annoyance, because in range
and originality, in his cerebral attack as
much as in his visceral energy, “Franta”,
“Noffels”, “Knuckles"—all by now very
much his noms de guerre —is untque.
Yet he regards himself as being sni
generis not because of the range of his
intellectual or cultural interests, or the
colorful, passionate, zealous, or some-
times intemperate way in which he has
expressed them. It is, he is convinced,
his anti-Communism and above all his
effective anti-Communism which has
made him that largely unknown figure
in Australian universities —a truly con-
troversial personality.
Fie has little time with “dissent” for
its own sake. In a paper he once gave
on conservative dissent he said: “The
criterion of an intelligent attitude is not
necessarily dissent. What is required is
the ability to adopt attitudes based on
critical and analytical intelligence,
irrespective of whether they are widely
shared or not. The prophet preaching
in the wilderness who is a fool should
not impress us unduly. There is too
much exaggerated concern with ‘dissent’
particularly the standardised phoney
variety. We should be more concerned
with truth and intelligence rather than
with group relations, and with the rights
of fools to confuse others.”
Now he considers himself running
against the prevailing wind of “ortho-
doxy” in universities where he sees
three kinds of establishment political at-
titudes acceptable: “You can be politi-
cally amorphous and mindless, sitting on
the fence and very popular—this is the
most common attitude; you can be Left-
wing, or you can be a member of the
Communist Party. Only uncompromis-
ing anti-Communism is out. This is the
real heresy.”

music, Central European cooking, the

short stories of Leslie Fiedler, the poli-
tical philosophy of Professor Sidney
Hook, and, Professor May notwithstand-
ing, Karl Marx. The accent is some-
where between Peter Lorre and an Eng-
lish don. There is no doubt about his
command of the language—either as
raconteur or lecturer; and there is no
failing to recognise the style . . . (“It
is becoming increasingly obvious . .
“There are two aspects to this question
. . .”) As with many of the points raised
against him the suggestion that he does
not have a sense of humor is a sign of
lack of acquaintance.
Born in Vienna because his family
felt it was “the posh bourgeois thing to
do”, he spent his childhood in Moravia.
When he was one year old, Franz Kafka
died and so did Lenin: Stalin began to
get rid of Trotsky, Hitler was in gaol,
Arthur Koestler was at the University
of Vienna, George Orwell was a police-
man in Burma, and Sigmund Freud was
arguing bitterly with his disciples.
Frank Knopfelmacher’s family was
one of academics, professional men,
businessmen and politicians. But the
“typically, normal, Central European
Jewish middle-class boyhood” came to a
sudden end with Munich, and the Nazi
occupation of Austria and Czechoslovakia
in 1938, when he found himself on one
of the last children’s transports to Pales-
tine. His family, of which he is the sole
survivor, found itself on a transport to
Auschwitz.
In Palestine he worked for a year on
a kibbutz, a time which has supplied
him with an endless supply of stories
about Amos Ben-Gurion, son of the
former Israeli Premier, and once Israel’s
Police Commissioner, who was the kib-
butz youth leader. For a while he was
a member of the Auxiliary settlement
police and a farm worker on a co-
operative. At this time, in the early
19405, he joined the Communist Party,
having been a supporter and Marxist
since the days of Munich, when at the
age of 15 he had been impressed with
the daring and toughness of the Com-
munists and embarrassed with the signs
of physical fear shown by those social
democratic political leaders whom he
had admired.
The belief that the Soviet Union was
really the only force capable of defeat-
ing Nazism strengthened the attachment.
In 1942 he volunteered for the Czech
unit of the British Army and took part
in the North African campaign as an
anti-aircraft gunner and then in the
liberation of France.
The war over, he enrolled at Prague
University as a philosophy student and
began work on a thesis on logical
atomism, an aspect of Bertrand Russell’s
philosophy. By this time he was not
only out of the Communist Party, having
been expelled after a year for speaking
German during the party’s proclaimed
period of “Slavonic brotherhood”, but
over, what he calls, his fellow-travelling
phase.
Mainly under the influence of George
Orwell’s column in the London Leftist
“Tribune”, he had become a non-Com-
rnunist. Arthur Koestler’s “Darkness at
Noon” had an “absolutely shattering
impact” and later the “Yogi and the
Commissar”, by the same author, com-
pletely changed his thinking.
He was still reluctant, however, to
extend his rejection of Communism to
the Soviet Union until in returning to
Prague he saw the “primitive behavior”
of the Red Army, the installing of Com-
munists in power who had been Nazi
collaborators during the war, and the
continuing anti-Semitism.
Six months before he was to receive
his doctorate, an action committee took
over Prague University and told him
that he could get his thesis on condi-
tion that he appended a passage con-
demning Bertrand Russell as a war-
monger. Russell, at the time, was advo-
cating the bombing of the Soviet Union.
“I pointed out that Russell’s political
views had no relevance to his episte-
mology.” It was not a convincing argu-
ment in 1948. “I then tried to get out
by various illegal means after the coup.
But my wife was not keen on this. One
of these escape methods involved jump-
ing out of a lavatory, which she cate-
gorically refused to do.”
In the immediate post-cowp chaos he
was able to get his family property back
after it had been confiscated on the


grounds that his grandmother who was
gassed in Auschwitz had spoken Ger-
man. “I sold it for an enormous amount
of absolutely valueless currency but
it was enough to get us a Bolivian visa,
and then a French transit visa.”
From France, with the help of the '(
international office of the British Labor
Party, as a refugee the second time
around, he went to Bristol University
through the assistance of Stephan Kor-
ner who later became Professor of Philo-
sophy. He took a double first in psycho-
logy and philosophy and went on to
get his Ph.D in psychology at London
University. He explains that Professor
Field, who headed the department at
Bristol, regarded it as essential for pro-
fessional philosophers to have complete
training in another discipline. “Psycho-
logy was my other specialty and I was
interested in the philosophy of science
at the time so that a Ph.D in an area
of neuro-physiology was the logical
thing.”
After a short period as research assis-
tant at London University, Dr Knopfel-
macher came to Melbourne University
in 1955. “I was quite amazed when I
found I was being pestered because I
was presenting normal American learning
theory in my lectures. There was pres-
sure on me to teach Russian Pavlovian
Lysenkoist rubbish. I resisted such inter-
ference with my teaching and it did
stop.”
He did not enter university politics
until 1956, although he had “no inten-
tion of starting a fight at the time.”
The serving of notice came at a meeting
protesting against the visit to Australia
of Baron von Krupp. Speakers at the
meeting included members of the Jew-
ish Council to Combat Fascism and
Anti-Semitism which was at the zenith
of its fellow-travelling line, and there
were attacks on the dangers of neo-
Nazism in West Germany and on rearm-
ing West Germany. When he rose to
speak and said his name was Frank
Knopfelmacher many Jewish students,
who had previously heard his name and
took it for granted that he was a
German, were shocked first to hear that
he was Jewish, then to hear that his
family had been exterminated at Ausch-
witz and then to hear that he did not
regard Nazism in West Germany as the
major threat to the world at all. What
was more he said in 1956 what is
quite fashionable now but was quite un-
nervingly novel at the time. No Jew
had the right, he maintained, to insult
the memory of the dead by exploiting
them for political purposes. He would
not allow it. “Who is this man Knopfel-
macher?” the question was asked for
the first but far from last time.
Then came Hungary “the immedi-
ate precipitating ground”. The defection
of leading Communist intellectuals led
to contacts with the Communist Party
where he worked to make them “anti-
Communist Left-wingers” and with
some moderate success. In 1957 he
joined the ALP Club and began what he
describes as helping to “build up a strong
anti-Communist social democratic or-
ganisation”. He gave lectures, arranged
seminars and obtained literature. His
political “operations” he feels have been
highly over-rated. Where he did have
an effect he insists is through his lectures,
through his presentation of “an analytical
approach” which helped to educate “a
generation of young intellectuals”.
Whatever role one assigns to Frank
Knopfelmacher there is no doubt that
the ALP was the leading club on the
campus in the early ’sixties. In this work
he regards the late Bill Thomas, a leading
political figure on the Melbourne Uni-
versity campus killed in a car accident,
as his greatest ally, and a sorely-missed
friend. After Thomas’ death, and
possibly to some extent because of it,
the relationship between Dr Knopfel-
macher and the ALP Club deteriorated.
Dr Knopfelmacher argues that he is not
only, or even predominantly, an anti-
Communist, but describes himself as a
“Gaitskellite social democratic liberal”,
with the particular difference that he is
uncompromising in his anti-Communism.
If one applies content analysis to his
lectures and seminars over the years, it
would be true to say that the range of
topics from talks on the sociology of
religion (to the Students’ Christian Move-
ment) to anti-Semitism (to the Jewish
Students’ Society) from Psychoanalysis
(to the Rationalists) to Max Weber (to
his special seminars) has been remark-
ably wide.
Polarisation
Tust how many individual students Dr
** Knopfelmacher decisively influenced
is of course impossible to say. There is
little doubt that for the four or five years
that he was at his most active he was
the political influence at Melbourne
University. Just what sort of a task he
set himself in 1957 may not be clear to
those who do not know the kind of pre-
vailing cultural and academic atmosphere
at Melbourne then.
The very combination of a progressive
radical who was also anti-Communist
was of course rare and exotic. Yet this
does not explain the nature of his attrac-
tion to many students, which, I believe,
was and still is based on his abilities as
a teacher. Attending a psychology lec-
ture, a seminar, a lunchtime talk or a
late-night party with Frank Knopfel-
macher is nearly always a “learning ex-
perience”. It is not just that he is contro-
versial. He teaches well, at his best gene-
rating excitement in a subject, without
sacrificing the intellectual level at which
he delivers and without recourse to
gimmicks.
As a former undergraduate, I recall
his two methodology lectures to third year
psychology students as being one of the
year’s highlights. His seminars in poli-
tical philosophy and sociology, which he
gave in his own time and which drew
academics as well as students, are one
of the few examples at Melbourne Uni-
versity of where a teacher has been able
to involve students intellectually over a
number of years in ideas.
In his general political activities he has
attacked apartheid, anti-Semitism, and
capital punishment. He attacked Senator
Goldwater before the Presidential elec-
tions last year, ironically enough in a
television debate with leading Communist
Ralph Gibson. His questioning of hypo-
crisy, cant and humbug is not restricted
to questions of Communism, as members
of the Jewish community know from his
classic exposure of the then weaknesses
of Melbourne's Mount Scopus College
two years ago in a debate at the Board of
Deputies. Typically he has delighted
many board delegates with his clarity and
wit and angered as many with his usually
unanswerable logic.
He is of course a threat to those Jews
who value respectability and acceptance
in the wider society, especially at estab-
lishment level. To others his opinions are
sometimes too extreme or too outrageous-
ly novel or just too outrageous.
Although he is not observant, he re-
gards his Jewishness as an “organic part”
of his personality.
Looked at then from the broad spec-
trum of his public life Dr Knopfel-
macher’s assertion that he is not only or
even predominantly an anti-Communist
has some basis. Yet continuing the argu-
ment Dr Knopfelmacher believes that it
is his distinctive anti-Communism which
has earned him enemies on the campus,
enemies so concerned at his effectiveness
that they engineered his departure from
the ALP Club.
With this view some of his former
friends and allies who broke with him in
recent years diffef;. To them the diffe-
rence arose out of his moving closer to
the DLP’s policies on defence and for-
eign affairs and his insistence that these
were the overriding issues in the club’s
activities. His student critics attack him
as a “polariser” who on entering any or-
ganisation splits it in terms of those who
are for him or against him. “Well, this
is nonsense. There has to be polarisation
in an organisation like the ALP Club
between those who want to defend Aus-
tralia and those who want to sell out.
This is not due to me but I did present
the issues. One of the reasons I wanted
to get away from Melbourne was to get

out of student politics and to concen-
trate only on my teaching. It is true that
I have attacked people very strongly
but I have been more attacked myself.
I reached the end of my salary scale as
a lecturer and have not been promoted. I
am told this is because one cannot inter-
fere with the recommendations of a pro-
fessor. So at Melbourne I am not promo-
ted because one may not interfere with
a professor, and at Sydney I am not
appointed because one may interfere
with a professor. The article in ‘2oth
Century’ is supposed to show that I
exaggerate, and that I am intolerant.
Well, I have written 50 articles and that
one was in the heat of a controversy
where my name and personality were the
subjects of crude slander. In any case,
even if it is a bad article, I still insist that
it is irrelevant in considering me for the
job.’ I am being misdescribed as a Mc-
Carthyite and Goldwaterite, which I am
not, but I insist that even if I were this
would be irrelevant. 1 have wanted to be
a teacher of philosophy since the age of
ten. This is my vocation. I have faults,
of course I have faults,
But I do not have a criminal record, I
do not take drugs, I am not an alcoholic,
I am discriminated against because of
my views. I demand justice for myself
and a change in conditions which allow
this kind of discrimination to go on in
Australian universities. Whatever those
who oppose me think, I am not defeated,
I am not giving in, and I will not fade
out of existence”.
Dr K in the
Lucky Country
Only in Australia
By DONALD HORNE
TI/Ty last memory of active under-
graduate life is of putting to bed a
special issue of “Honi Soit” in Novem-
ber, 1941, telling the Chancellor and
some members of the Senate that they
should resign.
We thought they had made beasts of
themselves in blocking the appointment
of Julius Stone to the Sydney Law
School. Stone's appointment had been
recommended by the Professorial Board
but some of the Phillip Street lawyers
wanted to put in one of their own men
instead of Stone, and inside the profes-
sion some despicable tactics had been
used. Stone wasn’t a returned soldier.
He was a Jew. Tactics like that.
We won. The late Alf Conlon master-
minded the operation, but practically
every decent person in the university
of any position supported his efforts.
After the fuss the Chancellor and some
of the other Senate members resigned.
It was a great victory.
All these years later it is ironic to
find that —in the Knopfelmacher case —
it is the Professorial -Board that has now
become the body that is prepared to
make decisions about academic appoint-
ments on a basis of irresponsible and un-
academic prejudice.
Perhaps this might have been ex-
pected. The Professorial Board is now
such a large, amorphous body in a large,
amorphous multiversity that it has be-
come an easily manipulable medium for
lobbying and “fixing”. The vote on the
Knopfelmacher case was close and if
all the professors had turned up—-instead
of little more than half of them —the
vote may have gone the other way quite
decisively.
It would be unfortunate if universities
are now prepared to have their affairs
determined by a lottery of professors
in a fiction of majority rule.
This question of narrow-minded,
second-rate provincial, attitudes seems
decisive in the case of Frank Knopfel-
macher. We ban “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover”; we try to send the editors of
“Oz” to gaol; we hunt “The Group” off
the shelves of Victorian bookshops; we
are afraid to let Russel Ward go to the
University of NSW; we stop Frank
Knopfelmacher from going to the Uni-
versity of Sydney.
The argument that Knopfelmacher is
not qualified for the position seems
spurious. He was recommended by the
people who know his field best. When it
comes to the appointment of a senior
lecturer in philosophy surely —in the
sprawling, two-cultured degree shops of
today all the Professorial Board can
do is to agree to the recommendations
of an expert selection committee.
God knows, enough undistinguished
people are appointed to universities by
experts without the inexpert trying to
make decisions too. It seems ludicrous
that professors who know nothing about
philosophy should set themselves up as
expert judges.
And it is typical of their very
aniateurism, their ignorant meddling,
that some of thpm should have argued
that because Knopfelmacher is a critic
of all the Communist regimes and Com-
munist parties he would not be qualified
to lecture on Marxism.
To Ted Hill’s brother-in-law this may
seem a disability. But to most of us
there seems no necessary connection
between the writings of Marx and the
practice of the various Communist
regimes and Communist parties. One
might as well say that a man could not
lecture on Christianity because he was
an opponent of Franco.
Professor Christiansen’s hosts in
Peking, for instance, would be among
the first people to enlighten him on the
difference between Marxism and Russian
Communism.
The public effect of the Professorial
Board’s hysterical decision is that they
have said: Despite the recommendations
of the men who are expert in his subject
we won't appoint Knopfelmacher be-
cause he has spent a lot of his spare
time expressing his opposition to various
brands of Communists.
This is a provincial attitude unworthy
of Sydney University. Even if some
people think Knopfelmacher is a nut
about Communism —so what? Aren’t
universities like all other institutions
packed with people who are con-
sidered by their critics to be nuts on
this subject or that?
Who is to determine who is a nut on
what? Is not nuttiness itself one of the
things that we are supposed to cherish
in universities? Are they not supposed
to distinguish themselves by their fear-
lessness and nonconformity?
Take John Anderson. In retrospect,
Anderson is now accepted as one of
Sydney’s great men (although for most
of his career most of the university hated
him and some of his colleagues tried to
get him the sack). In Knopfelmacher
terms Anderson was also a nut about
Communism. Would the university have
refused to appoint John Anderson to.
a senior lectureship (as it did refuse once
to appoint Karl Popper)? Perhaps the
answer is yes. Too unsettling to have
these chaps around.
The conformity of Australian life is
one'of its most deadening characteristics.
Our universities carry on this deadly
work when they disbar men like Knop-
felmacher.
And it.-makes matters worse when
this is followed by an attempt at job
control of Professor David Armstrong
for saying what he thought about the
Knopfelmacher decision.
Universities are not supposed to be
closed shops in which nice chaps band
together for their own convenience.
If academics think otherwise, they
are dojng Australia and the universities
a great disservice at a time when—more
than anything else —we need the shocks
and rough and tumble of a clash of
ideas.

Letters to the Editor
“Keeping Up With the
Schmidts”
SIR.—I read The Bulletin daily in the
train on the way to my office. This
morning I felt I had a difficult day
ahead, but after reading Ross Campbell’s
“Keeping up with the Schmidts” I
reached my office gurgling with laughter,
and the day has proved to be not so
difficult after all. May we have more
articles from Ross Campbell please. I
know of no better safeguard against
peptic ulcers.

“STOCKBROKER”
The Fleet
SIR. —In the first paragraph of my report
on the change in Fleet organisation (8.,
April 24) I inadvertently used the word
“latter” instead of “former”. It is, of
course, FOCAF who goes to sea, and not
FOICEA.
Canberra (ACT). Youß Correspondent
SIR. —Your correspondent makes the
surprising suggestion that the Flag Offi-
cer Commanding Her Majesty’s Austra-
lian Fleet (FOCAF) should never go to
sea with the Fleet; and that, instead, a
senior Captain, rated up to Commodore,
should take command. This would never
do. FOCAF’s primary role at sea in
peace is to train the Fleet for war, to
guide his Captains and to assess their
suitability for promotion. A Captain
could not perform this task with his
own peers. In addition, it would be
completely unacceptable to have no sea-
going Admirals in the RAN. The men
who run the Navy should understand it
as it is now, and not as it was years
ago when they were Captains.
The plan under the present command
reorganisation is that FOCAF controls
the whole Fleet, except when his sea-
going duties take him away from his
shore headquarters. On such occasions,
in peacetime, the command, exercised
through the same shore-based staff,
passes to FOICEA, the other Admiral
based in Sydney. It should be a smooth
transition because FOICEA, in all pro-
bability, will recently have served as
FOCAF himself. Since it is true, as your
correspondent says, that FOICEA is
hard-worked already, it is planned that,
in war-time, a third, specially appointed,
Admiral would be brought in to exer-
cise operational command from the
Fleet shore headquarters in Sydney,
thereby releasing FOCAF for command
of the Fleet at sea.
That this third officer would come
from Navy Office, as stated by your
correspondent, is by no means definite.
As foreseen at this point of time, a more
likely and effective arrangement is that
FOICEA would assume the overall
operational role, while FOCAF com-
manded the Fleet at sea, and a third
Admiral, who would be selected at the
time, would assume control of the East
Australia Area base. Three Admirals to
fill each of these appointments are not
available, nor are they required in
peace-time; hence the idea of splitting
the command in peace-time between the
existing two. Your correspondent
describes this as “clumsy”. One would
have thought, given the limitations, and
the desirability of making the most
effective use of existing resources, that
it was quite the reverse. However that
may be, his own solution to the problem
is not feasible.

SIR. —I would like to correct a false
impression which could arise from Miss
Patricia Rolfe's article (8., April 17).
The PR gentlemen concerned were em-
ployed by the gallery and I did not know
of their existence until my arrival. I
accepted the situation on the assumption
that this was a standard practice with
Sydney galleries. I subsequently found
this to be true with some galleries and
not with others. I agree with Miss Rolfe
that in my case such a practice was un-
necessary.
ALBERT TUCKER
Melbourne (Vic.)
The North
SIR.—“If Captain Cook had had an
economist aboard . . (8., April 10),
that economist would surely have studied
the continent’s water resources. And
having done so, he would then hardly
have recommended that development
should begin in the parts farthest from
the only area of abundant and reliable
rainfall, i.e., the tropics. Development
began in the south-east not because that
was the best area to start a nation, but
merely the best place to dump convicts.
It would be pushing the luck of this
lucky country just too far to carry on as
if the path of national development we
were so fortuitously set on were the right
path, the only path. Dr Davidson would
have us merely push existing frontiers
back, bit by bit, in a kind of creeping
progress, as we have always done. But
whatever the merit of his case, he and
his school bury their heads in the very
sands which they say aren’t worth
irrigating. They ignore the fact that
water is the key to Australia’s develop-
ment.
Whether we like it or whether today’s
economists choose to see it, lack of
water will in the end limit not only agri-
cultural but even more decisively, in-
dustrial expansion in the south. The
trend of development must be towards
the North because that’s where the
water is. We must save and use that
water.

The Ceylonese Elections
SlR.—Referring to my article on the
Ceylonese elections (8., April 24),
Mr J. Jupp charges me in a letter
(8., April 24) with having been
“totally misinformed on a number
of points which he has clearly not
checked”. He complains that I
described Dr N. M. Perera as a Com-
munist whereas, Mr Jupp says, Dr
Perera is leader of the Lanka Sama
Samaja Party “and, therefore, tech-
nically a Trotskyist” who subscribes
“to radical and social-democratic
principles”. But isn’t '‘technically a
Trotskyist” (whatever this means) a
Communist according to Trotsky—as
there are now Communists according
to Lenin, Stalin, Mao and perhaps
Khrushchev or Brezhnev?
The Ceylonese welfare-state in its
present form was not established by
Mr Senanayake’s father but by the
late Prime Minister Bandaranaike and
his wife. I have absolutely no quarrel
with it, except that Ceylon cannot
afford it. I may have been wrong
attributing the rice-subsidies to the
Bandaranaike regime. But I wrote
that “no democratically-elected Gov-
ernment would survive if the rice
subsidy were substantially lowered
and the price of rice were increased”,
and I see that Mr Jupp agrees al-
though he says that no Government
would dispense with welfare-measures
and rice subsidies, “expediency aside”.
To attribute the increase in Red
Chinese influence in Ceylon to Dudley
Senanayake’s rice-rubber agreement
is as absurd as if one stated that Aus-
tralian wheat-sales to Red China under
the Menzies Government “initiated
the policy of drawing nearer to
China”.
Mr Jupp assails me for writing that
the US decision to cut off economic
aid was in retaliation for the national-
isation without compensation of oil
companies. He says that this action
was caused by a clause “in the US
foreign aid laws which makes this
kind of action punishable”. Well,
isn’t “retaliation” a punishment? He
asserts that Ceylon tried to compen-
sate the oil companies. The question
is with how little if at all? I have
nowhere written that Ceylon has not
suspended luxury imports and I have
advocated “massive” economic aid
not “a mass exercise in Western
bribery” as Mr Jupp charges. Is
economic aid wonderful if it comes
from Communist countries and a
“bribery” if it comes from the West?
So, excepting the origin of rice subsidy
where have I been “totally misin-
formed”?

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Olsen’s
Bright
Ceilings
By PATRICIA ROLFE
John Oi.sen, one of Sydney’s most
exuberant and enterprising painters,
has turned to ceilings and tapestries,
both to voice protest and to explore
possibilities.
The characteristic Olsen protest is
against the “coldness” of modern archi-
tecture. As ancient tapestries had the
utilitarian purpose of keeping out the
cold, Mr Olsen feels that modern ones
can provide an “emotional warmth”.
His ceilings he regards as another protest
against modern architecture which is
“frightened of decoration”. He wants
to voice his protest in designs “teeming
with life and covered with scribbles”.
Painted ceilings manage to give a
Renaissance sweep to Sydney art pro-
duction but they also present problems
in hanging in modern galleries. Once
you have got them through the door and
hung, there is the logical but disconcert-
ing tendency of viewers to lie on the floor
to see them.
However, the Clune Galleries are in
a state of rare excitement about the first
showing of two Olsen ceilings, “Le Soleil”
and “La Primavera”, both 92 inches by
121. The gallery is also showing his first
tapestry, “Joie de Vivre”, which is 71
inches by 94. This is probably the first
Australian tapestry, just as Mr Olsen is
the first local artist to work extensively
on ceilings. He has so far done six. The
tapestry, of course, presents fewer prob-
lems in exhibition. When you have
finished you can just roll it up and carry
it away. There are also oils and drawings
in the exhibition.
There have been murmurs about Mr
Olsen’s ceilings, but, apart from members
of the Art Gallery Society trooping
through the living-room of Mr Frank
McDonald, a director of the Clune, to
view his. they have not been on show
until now. One of those in the exhibition
has been bought by a man in public life,
who, however, doesn’t particularly want
it known that he indulges himself in
this way in private.
Mr Olsen “got into” ceilings in the
simplest way possible. “Frank Mc-
Donald said to me one day, ‘My fiat is
below street-level and it’s almost im-
possible to lighten it. Do you think you
could put something on the ceiling?’ ”
With his first ceilings Mr Olsen worked
on a hardboard surface in situ, but now
he has decided that the basic thing is
that they should be easy to take down
and re-erect. “Most people these days
move house several times in a lifetime,”
he said. “You should be able to get a
ceiling down in half an hour and put it
up again in the same time.” Wasn’t there
the problem of different room sizes? “I
can’t go through all the crises with
people,” he said. “They’ll have to work
that out for themselves.”
Mr Olsen felt that doing ceilings was
a much more personal matter than easel-
paintings. He had to see the room
before he began to work and he liked
to know the people, but a painted ceil-
ing didn’t restrict the style of furniture
or furnishing. One was in a Colonial
room.
However, ceilings did call up dif-
ferent artistic attitudes from easel-paint-
ings.
“An easel-painting becomes an arena
for battle, part of the philosophical
debate between yourself and the world,”
he said. “But a ceiling painting cannot
be in conflict. It must float in air. It
must stay up there. It is essentially
lyric in form.”
The tapestry is the culmination of
two years’ study and work, when Mr
Olsen learnt as much as he could here
about the qualities and limitations of
tapestry. In this time Mr Frank Mc-
Donald visited the Aubusson factory in
France where Lurcat, who single-handed
brought tapestry out of the frozen state
in which it had existed for several
centuries to have vigorous application in
the 20th century, has his studio. Mr
Olsen now plans to go to Lurcat’s studio
to work, perhaps for a year.
He is confident that his ideas and
style are sufficiently well established not
to be easily disturbed by other influences,
and he is not afraid of working for a
while in a medium which has''such
definite limitations. “Although I do see
that it could have the same danger as,
say, printmaking,” he said. “Many print-
makers become so absorbed in techniques
that they almost forget about subject
altogether.”
Lurcat began his tapestries, some of
which have been seen in Australia, when
he returned home wounded during
World War I and his mother suggested
embroidery as therapy.
According to a recent article in
“Realites”, in 1925 there were 400
workers in tapestry in France compared
with 100,000 in 1550. Between 1900
and 1910 the Beauvais factory produced
an average of 20 square yards a year.
Each workman produced H square
inches a month. Stitches became finer
and 14,600 different shades were used.
The basic idea of tapestry had become
to copy painting more and more closely.
Not only did tapestry become restricted
in style but it involved endless repetitions
of pastoral or bucolic themes.
Lurcat cut the palette to 47 colors
(Olsen has about 20 in .his tapestry),
introduced rugged textures and cut the
cost of a tapestry to one-fifth of the old
price.
According to “Realites”, Lurcat was
a “sturdy Left-winger”, whose idea was
to bring art to the people. However,
more and more the tapestries became the
indulgence of big business, and any
pleasure they gave workers was inciden-
tal. One Swiss business-house com-
missioned a £IO,OOO tapestry for its
£3,000,000 building, and estimated that
it cost less than the doorknobs. But
although Lurcat was drawn aside from
his original idealism, his tapestries have
“made the sad walls of our cities sing”.
Mr Olsen feels that tapestries could
make the sad walls of Australian cities
sing. At present, he thinks, not enough
art, “except a few odd pieces of sculp-
ture”, is finding its way into new build-
ings. This may be due to lack of interest
and knowledge on the part of big busi-
ness, but it may be that art in its present


forms is not scaled to modern cities. Mr
Olsen may be able to cut through in-
difference with his bold and exciting
ceilings and tapestries.
A Phillip for
The Theatre
By KATHERINE RANDERSON
Time was when the drama off-stage
at the Sydney Phillip Theatre
seemed a good deal more interest-
ing than anything that was going on on-
stage. Not only had the bright, eager
days of the early Phillip Street revues
gone, but it looked as if the Phillip
might, too.
However, two years ago the Phillip
abruptly had a change of heart and a
change of management. Paul Riomfalvy,
who had been a film-maker in his native
Hungary, formed a new company with
Eric Duckworth, a Phillip Street original.
William Orr, the founder of the Phillip,
was retained as resident producer.
The Phillip since has become the
only substantial theatre management to
emerge in the postwar years. There has
been a large number of people striking
out as entrepreneurs but, in terms of
owning or leasing theatres and presenting
stage shows, the field is still held between
Williamson’s, Tivoli, Garnet Carroll,
with Edgley in the West, and now
Phillip.
Today the Phillip has a weekly over-
head of something like £15,000. For
the past year they have consistently had
one or two shows going in both Sydney
and Melbourne. At the moment that
breadwinner “Boeing Boeing” is finish-
ing a successful run in New Zealand,
“The Knack” is doing well at the Phillip
but will make way for “A Severed Head”
next month, and “Is Australia Really
Necessary?” is coming to the end of a
Melbourne run during which the box-
office has been as good as for a musical
comedy. “Difference of Opinion” will
come to the Theatre Royal, Sydney, next
month after its Melbourne run.
“A Severed Head” will star Robin
Bailey, supported by a local cast. This
follows the Phillip’s astute policy, not of
import for import's sake, but of using
overseas players and directors when they
feel they are necessary, and cleverly, too,
picking people who may have gained a
reputation here under other manage-
ments or in other media.
Phillip has also bought rights to Alan
Melville’s “Finder Please Return”, Trevor
Peacock’s “The Collapse of a Stout
Party” and Murray Schisgal’s “Luv”.
It hasn’t been a 100 per cent success,
of course. One or two shows have col-
lapsed abruptly and dismally. However,
the Phillip management seems to have
made a model transfer from the limited
field of revue to production of a variety
of straight plays.
In spite of the great success of “Is Aus-
tralia Really Necessary?” Phillip thought
for a while that it was unlikely that it
would ever do revue in time and that
they might have got out of the field just
in time. The reason was the übiquitous
“Mavis Bramston Show” on television.
“We felt that we could rehearse a new
number for several days,” Mr Riomfalvy
said, “and put it into the show on Mon-
day. They could ‘lift’ the idea and do
something the same thing on Wednesday
and kill our sketch for ever. It would
hardly matter whether they did it badly
or well. Anyone who saw it in the
theatre would say, ‘That’s old.’ The
‘Mavis Bramston Show’ has already used
a variant of our Princess Anne opening
the Opera House sketch from ‘ls Aus-
tralia Really Necessary?’ It killed it
dead.”
However, the Phillip already has
writers working on sketches for a revue
planned for August. This, apparently,
is because they feel competition from
television revue will be less strong or
non-existent by then, and because their
party-booking organisers assure them
that there is an insistent demand from
regular patrons for a new revue. They
also hope for a strong backlash from the
“Mavis Bramston Show” with people
who had never seen or heard a revue
finding their way into the theatre after
seeing something of it on television.
Mr Riomfalvy said that it cost ten
times as much for them to stage a revue
as when Phillip Street began 10 years
ago. Part of this was the greatly in-
creased cost of salaries and wages, but
there is also the fact that the theatre is
now 100 per cent professional, back-stage
and at the front of the house.
It therefore seems courageous for the
Phillip to rush into a field which other
managements are hurriedly vacating. Mr
Riomfalvy admits that audiences for
straight plays are not easy to gather in,
they do not “build” like those for musical
comedies, adherents of which will go to
anything in the field, good or bad. He
also believes that the demands for cast-
ing a straight play are greater. You can-
not tail off comfortably into incom-
petence in the small parts as you can in
a musical comedy without anyone
noticing much.
But although the older managements
are wary of straight plays, they will still
buy a slice of one. The Phillip has gone
about things in a fairly subtle way. It
quickly established a name for itself as
a presenter of commercially acceptable
plays, as well as revue, then it split the
risk with other managements, more often
than not the Tivoli, which has rarely
presented straight theatre under its own
banner.
Above all, it got out and sold theatre.
All managements do this nowadays, but
Phiflip may have been a little less
hampered by tradition. “If you sat and
waited for people to go to the box-office
and buy their seats you would go broke
in a week,” Eric Duckworth said. “Today
it probably costs us 10s. to sell every
255. seat in the theatre, but we do sell
them. When we join forces with other
managements, it is customary to show
them your books, box-office receipts and
so on. but no one would ever share their
party-booking list with another manage-
ment. We have Mrs King working in
the theatre at party bookings. She has
more than 1000 contacts on her books,
groups from offices, factories, clubs and
stores who go together to the theatre.
We also have another staff member con-
tinually ‘on the road’ enlisting fresh
groups.”
Another way of getting out and selling
theatre has been to take it to people
rather than waiting for people to £ome
to you. In June, “Boeing Boeing”, with-
out its star Peter Jones, but otherwise
intact, will go on a tour of several
licensed clubs in the Sydney area. “Many
of these clubs have far better facilities
than we can muster,” Mr Duckworth
said, “so why not put them to use?”

Before the credit titles of “The Sound
Of Music” come up, there’s a cloud-
filled screen with only the whistling wind
on the sound track. Slowly the camera
dives through the mists to show mountain
peaks and at last the gfeen foothills with
a girl’s figure tiny on the horizon: the
signal for a burst of richly recorded
music. From that moment —really from
the first wind gust “The Sound Of

For spme of the crabbier filmgoers, its
v/arm-hearted charm may be a little
overpowering. It’s rather like eating a
meal composed entirely of apfelstrLidel,
whipped cream and linzertorte; but
they’re all perfectly prepared and made
of the finest ingredients. In its own
kind the film is pretty well flawless.

TOP AWARD FOR TABLE WINES
The Maurice O’Shea Table Wine
Trophy for the exhibitor gaining the
highest number of points for still table
wines has been awarded again to
McWilliam’s Wines.
Amongst McWilliam’s table wines,
which are becoming more and more
popular with Australian diners, are
Moselle and Lovedale Riesling.
The Moselle, an international gold
medal winner, is a delicate light white
table wine with the full aroma and
flavour of the grapes from which it was
made. It is slightly sweet, well balanced
and crisp.
Lovedale Riesling has been a prize-
winner in many shows. It is a dry white
table wine of pale golden tint with a
delicate flavour and bouquet.
These wines complement all foods and
are particular favourites with sea foods,
white meats, chicken, omelettes and
other light dishes. Of course wine is
becoming more “fact” than “fancy” and
many people drink white wines with
any dish. White wines should always
be served well chilled.
One of the many fine red table wines
from McWilliam’s vineyards is Rosedale
Claret, another international gold medal
winner. It is recommended that red
table wines should be served at room
temperature with steaks, roasts, rich
poultry foods such as duck, and with
cheese. Red table wines are becoming
very popular at barbecues. McWilliam’s
Rosedale Claret has been judged by
those who know as a choice, delicate
and fragrant wine.
Becoming increasingly popular is
Sparkling Chateau-Gay, a natural spark-
ling wine by McWilliam’s. This is a
gay light sparkling wine for all festive
occasions, and is also an international
gold medal winner.
These are just a few of the table
wines of McWilliam’s, a Company
proud of being the winner of the Most
Successful Exhibitor Trophy for the
fourth successive year at the Sydney
Royal Easter Show.
sends as governess to the seven mother-
less children of Captain von Trapp, who
treats them as if they were naval cadets
on one of his ships.
Maria, described by the nuns as “a
flibbertigibbet, a will - o’ - the - wisp, a
clown”, is really more like a brisk,
likeable head prefect. In no time she
has jollied the children out of their fear
of thunderstorms, taught them to sing,
reunited them with their father, and won
the hand of the gallant captain against
the competition of a dressy baroness.
Happy ending? Not quite yet the
Nazis are coming, and Maria and the
captain have to smuggle the family out
of Austria under the noses of the
Gestapo, winning the Salzburg Folk
Festival on the way.
Julie Andrews bounces through her
role with enormous verve, and brings a
welcome tartness to her early exchanges
with the captain (gracefully played by
a miscast Christopher Plummer). The
familiar music is pleasingly presented,
and the backgrounds, photographed in
and around Salzburg, are so absurdly,
deliriously pretty that there’s no resisting
them.
“Don Giovanni” takes us to Salzburg
again: Paul Czinner’s film never pretends
to be anything but a photographed record
of an actual performance at the Salzburg
Opera House. It’s beautifully sung and
well recorded—much better than “Der
Rosenkavalier”—and generally a pleasure
to the ear.
Visually it is less satisfactory. The
camerawork is static almost to the point
of immobility, and although the Opera
House has a fine big stage and lavish
decor, it is very obviously a stage set.
(For instance, the first half has only one
set a town square where the main
characters of the opera happen, by good
fortune, to live next door to one another;
to avoid scene-shifting, anyone who
wants to get murdered, bewail their lot,
try to seduce somebody or celebrate a
rustic wedding has to come out into the
street to do it.)
It’s asking a lot to expect a great
singer to be handsome and a good actor
as well. Cesare Siepi makes a dashing
enough Don Giovanni, but he seems
more a flirt than a destroyer the
“Champagne Aria”, as he sings it, is just
a jolly drinking song, not an expression
of almost blasphemous defiance. Still,
his performance has dignity and restraint.
But the camera’s cold eye is unkind
to the elephantine caperings of Otto
Edelmann as Leporello and to Erna
Berger’s heavily roguish performance as
Zerlina.
To my mind, opera is only successful
on the screen when presented in
cinematic terms as in the Russian
“Eugene Onegin” or the Italian “Tosca”
—with realistic sets and a free-ranging
camera, and, if necessary, trained actors
with the singers’ voices dubbed in.

Fun in Acapulco
Love Has Many Faces. Director, Alexander
Singer. State Theatre, Sydney.
“You’re 90 per cent man and 10 per
cent rat.” “Anytime you want the 90
per cent just reach out and grab it.”
“I'd break my arm first.” This delect-
able exchange occurs in the first third
of “Love Has Many Faces”, a splendid
concoction harking back to the good old
days of Hollywood, to the fine madness
of a Crawford or a Davis vehicle. Lana
Turner plays an immensely rich woman,
discovered in the opening sequence
languishing in yellow on a yacht in Aca-
pulco harbor, her marriage with a beach
bum (Cliff Robertson) threatening to go
on the skids, and another gigolo (Hugh
O’Brien) unscrupulously in the offing.
Alexander Singer, whose “Cold Wind in
August” has a cult following, directs;
the engagingly crazy dialogue is by Mar-
guerite Roberts; and there are some me-
morably jaded scenes between two rich
women (Ruth Roman and Virginia Grey,
spectacularly ruined) and the beach boys
they ogle, as well as the unforgettable
sight of Lana Turner being gored by a
bull. Joseph Ruttenberg, veteran of
“Gaslight” and “Waterloo Bridge”, l pro-
vided the picture's light, attractive, deli-
cately colored photography of Acapulco's
beaches and bullrings.

Eileen DiTullio. Town Hall, Sydney.
Eileen DiTullio, first of the ABC's 1965
“celebrities”, opened the recital season
at the Town Hall with a varied pro-
gramme. Described as a coloratura singer
in advance publicity and programme
notes, she is in fact a lyric soprano
who is obliged to include light colora-
tura in her operatic work and reper-
toire quite the usual thing for any
singer with ambition and the wish to
earn a living. The recital was an enjoy-
able occasion, for many reasons; regret-
tably, Sydney's music-lovers did not
turn out in great numbers to hear her.
Miss DiTullio, who was born and
trained in the United States, does not
accept Melba's advice to “give them
muck”. Her programme was one of
the most interesting for many a day,
on paper at any rate. It ranged from
Paradisi and Handel, through Wolf,
Strauss, Mozart. Rossini, Bellini and
Donizetti, to a French group of Duparc,
Hahn, Faure, Delibes, Berlioz and
Debussy. If this looks better than it
sounded, the reason is the apparent
lightness of the singer’s voice and the

absence of genuinely dramatic material
from the recital.
As some other singers in recent
seasons, Miss DiTullio appeared in a
slightly odd and heavily-sequined gown;
the resultant glare made it difficult to
look at her. She is a singularly relaxed
singer, with a fine and clear intonation;
she was never obliged to extend herself
and clearly had quite considerable vocal
reserves remaining unused. Her colora-
tura, when called for. is dainty, almost
in miniature, with beautifully shaped
pure glides, easily breathed and free of
slurring.
Margaret Schofield, a Melbourne
pianist previously known to us mainly
as a chamber musician with the Glick-
man Trio, proved an admirably sensi-
tive accompanist throughout the varied
programme. The singer's voice was far
too light to do justice to “Let the Bright
Seraphim'’ from Handel's “Samson” and
not quite big enough even for Pamina’s
aria from “The Magic Flute”. But “Care
selve” from Handel's “Atalanta” was
quite convincing and three songs each
by Wolf and Richard Strauss were beau-
tifully shaped. Allowing for some
indistinct enunciation, they were among
the finest lieder singing heard here in
recent years. I was equally happy with
Faure’s “Ici-bas”, two charming Debussy
.songs and Berlioz’ “Villanelle”, a rarely
heard masterpiece.
Operatic arias were quite clearly what
the audience wanted most, and they
were given excellent ones from “Semi-
ramide” and “I Puritani”; less successful
was “II faut partir” by Donizetti which,
for all its lovely lyricism, lacked the
dramatic sadness inherent in the text.
Miss DiTullio's programme included,
patriot : cally, four works by American
composers; most of this music was so
pathetically trite that it would have better
been omitted. Except for this, the shap-
ing of the programme and the convincing
manner in which the French- and Ger-
man songs especially were presented,
suggest that this singer has considerable
musical taste which, added to a wholly
agreeable and beautifully controlled
voice, should guarantee her satisfied, if
not wildly enthusiastic, audiences.

grandmother, an imperious old lady who
wants to keep Laurel and not give her
back to her mother.
“My case is practically in' Freud,”
announces the girl to the applicants for
the job of being her lady companion.
But she meets her match in Miss Madri-
gal who has just come out of prison.
So purged and strengthened is Miss
Madrigal by this experience that she is
able to sort out Laurel, stiffen up Mait-
land, the self-doubting manservant, also
an ex-convict, and defeat Pinkbell, the
ex-butler, a bed-ridden eminence grise
who rules the household unseen from his
bedroom upstairs.
“The Chalk Garden” is well supplied
with “characters”, it is cleverly con-
structed and amusingly written, and I
don’t suppose there is any danger of
anyone taking it seriously for a moment.
Which is just as well because it is a very
silly play, full of moral and intellectual
muddle. “The Chalk Garden” is a far
less moral play than, for example,
“Entertaining Mr Sloane”. But it is
unlikely to shake the suburbs.
The women in this play, a monstrous
regiment, have very strong parts which
should not be over-played. Roberta
Frankland as Miss Madrigal, Carolle
Coy as Laurel and Marie Byron as Mrs
St Maugham all tended to do just this.
Hugh Richardson played Maitland with
a much lighter touch.

Less inhibited jazz is likely to be heard
in the relaxed atmosphere of a night-club
than at a concert or a formal recording
session; there is also a strong possibility
that the music will be ragged and dis-
organised. These bop classics, recorded
live at Cafe Society and the Royal Roost
in New York during the experimental
years 1948 to 1950, both gain and suffer
from the casual circumstances of the
recording.
At this time, the late Charlie
Parker’s catalytic saxophone was setting
the jazz world on fire as well as dis-
rupting it and, although no longer start-
ling in their modernity, these tracks are
sufficiently illustrative of his genius.
“Cheryl” and the two versions of “Salt
Peanuts” are frantic, up-tempo affairs
in which the musicians show more
dexterity than control. Parker was justly
famed for his phenomenally fast thinking
and execution, but even he occasionally
shows signs of strain. A short, rather
blase version of “How High the Moon”
is steadier but too fast for the number.
“Street Beat” and “Big Foot” are taken
at more sensible tempos and, conse-
quently, swing more and allow the per-
formers to think. Kenny Dorham plays
trumpet on three tracks and either he or
Miles Davis on another three. There is
some doubt about this and, as both men
were currently under the influence of
Dizzy Gillespie, it is difficult to deter-
mine. The thinness of Parker’s alto
tone is very evident on the slow “Out of
Nowhere”, but he blows at his best on
Tizol’s “Perdido”, which also features
Fats Navarro's trumpet and the incred-
ible piano technique of Bud Powell. Un-
fortunately, this excellent track is marred
by the over-recorded bashing of Roy
Haynes, whereas all other tracks are
assisted by Max Roach’s percussive
artistry.
Antonio Ruiz Soler is to the dance
in Spain what Margot Fonteyn is to
London's Royal Ballet or Galina
Ulanova was to ballet in the Soviet
Union. Combining a gypsy personality
with a solid musical background and
a wide knowledge of choreography, he
has become the best known exponent of
flamenco. One of the most exciting of
all flamenco dances is “La Tabera del
Toro” (“The Bull’s Tavern’’), a series
of coplas and rhythms of popular origin
that have been adapted and arranged by
Antonio especially for this recording.
Although the language is a barrier to full
understanding, the changing moods,
from the lively opening, “Cancion y
Fiesta”, to the melancholic “La Cana”,
are universal in their expressiveness. My
enjoyment of the performance is derived
almost entirely from the delightful guitar
playing of Manuel Moreno and Jose
Gimenez y Sebitas, particularly in the
passages in which the castanets and the
heel work of the dancers does not inter-
fere. The harsh-toned singing of Pepe
Fuentes and Rosita Segovia is probably
an acquired taste.
Tacked on at the end is a tragic
“cantes de Fragua” which, without help

A Cry from the Confessional
By VIVIAN SMITH
For the Union Dead. Robert Lowell.
Faber. 255. 6d.
Everyone seems to agree that Robert
Lowell is one of the most considerable
poets of our time, but that he is a flawed
and uneven writer: “A great talent who
has not yet written a great book of
poems,” as Hugh Staples expressed it in
a recent admiring study.
“Life Studies” came as something of
a disappointment to many of Lowell’s
early devotees. Its autobiographical
pieces, wayward, daringly brilliant in
their hit-or-miss method, were seen by
some as a draining away of the psychic
tension that had made Lowell’s first
work so profoundly challenging and
exhilarating. Others, however, wel-
comed its break with rhetorical excess
and stridenev. its moments of lapidary
wit, its cultivation of the
succinct in a group of
poems rooted in the local
and the actual, its utter
accuracy of tone.
Divisions and distinc-
tions between a writer’s
early and later work are
usually obvious and in-
evitable. Clearly the
author of “The Quaker
Graveyard in Nan-
tucket”, “In Memory of
Arthur Winslow” and
“Children of Light” is a
more than considerable poet, and so ’s
the author of “Man and Wife”, “Skunk
Hour” and “Ford Madox Ford” in “Life
Studies”. Only a major poet could have
produced a book like “Imitations’, or
the rendering of Racine’s “Phedre”.
What is admirable about Lowell is his
restless innovation, the quality of the
change and renewal that is characteristic
of his work. He never stays put. He
frequently overreaches himself, and
there can be a loudness at the centre
of his work which may indicate a genuine
disturbance and which is certainly at
its most controlled a reflection of the
violence and nihilism latent in American
society but w'hich sometimes refuses
to be steadied into rhythm and rhyme.
But in spite even perhaps because of
excesses, Lowell is an exemplary
figure. He knows that a poet needs to
sail far out if he is to return with a
fresh haul of images and experiences,
and that the danger of being wrecked on
the way is part of it all.
Like “Life Studies”, “For the Union
Dead"’ is a transitional work: lit up here
and there by astonishing images and
stanzas, containing some of the best
poems Lowell has written, it is full of
possibilities and suggestions, and odd
pieces of dead wood.
Lowell, a deeply confessional poet,
has been father figure to some of the
most brilliant recent American confes-
sional poets Anne Sexton, W. D.
Snodgrass. Frederick Seidel in particular
who take as their subjects mental
illness, nervous breakdown, intimate
revelations about the failures of their
marriages or suicides, divorce,, separa-
tions experiences which for too long
were excluded from direct reference in
poetry and which now threaten to be
considered by some as the one true way
to great art.
Lowell was imprisoned as a con-
scientious objector during the war, his
relationship with his parents was marked
by exceptional tensions,
he has spent some time
in a mental home: all
these experiences are
centrai to some of his
later poems. The sensi-
b:lity throughout Low-
ell’s poetry is usually raw
and exposed: but in some
of his most autobio-
graphical pieces the
traumas resist transfor-
mation; the private and
the personal become in-
extricably merged. Th : s
seems to me to be the case in one
way or another with “New York 1962”,
“The Severed Head” and “The Neo-
Classical Urn” poems which remain
somewhat opaque in their reference and
possible appeal.
Among the best poems in “For the
Union Dead” and they show how
close in origin many of Lowell’s suc-
cesses are to his failures are the pieces
which take as their themes poor eye-
sight and myopia, poems about pain
which drive home to us the inescapable
realities of physical existence. One
wonders in passing if Lowell’s poor eye-
sight is not related to the fact that he
is primarily a poet of touch rather than
of sight; though he can alwhys surprise us
with wonderfully visual pieces of living
detail, as at the end of “The Drinker”:
Out on the street
two cops on horseback clop through
the April rain
to check the parking meter viola-
tions —
their oilskins yellow as forsythia.
Or in the Ted Hughes-like observations
of the fine “July in Washington”:
Otters slide and dive and slick back
their hair,
racoons clean their meat in the creek
and further on:
distant hills powdered blue as a girl’s
eyelid.
“For the Union Dead” confirms the
change in Lowell’s style which first be-
came apparent in “Life Studies” a
change towards brevity, an imagist
precision that perhaps owes more to
Ungaretti and Montale than to any
English or American poet. One has
only to compare any of his fully-felt,
dramatic, rhetorical early elegies with the
short poem here to Alfred Corning
Clark to see what this change has meant.
Here his point of departure is an obituary
article and photograph of a school friend
in the “New York Times” and the poem
is wry, almost offhand. It achieves its
paradoxical intensity through under-
statement —but what a change from the
early Lowell! Likewise the magnificent
“Fall 1961” which works with the
suggestive sparseness of a haiku:
All autumn, the chafe and jar
of nuclear war;
we have talked our extinction to death.
I swim like a minnow
behind my studio window.
Our end drifts nearer,
the moon lifts,
radiant with terror.
The state
is a diver under a glass be'l.
But signs of the early Lowell are here,
too. notablv in the extraordinary mono-
logue “Caligula”: “You stare down hall-
ways, mile on stoney mile,/ where statues
of the gods return your smile in the
reprint of “Beyond the A'ps” with an
additional stanza that gives the whole
an historical and personal dimension
much greater than the shorter version
in “Life Studies”; and most interestingly
in the poem “Jonathan Edwards in
Western Massachusetts” where he returns
once more to the eighteenth-century
Calvinist who has so much preoccupied
him . . .
But the outstanding poem here is the
title piece with its intricate weaving of
themes of past and present, childhood
and middle age, historical action and
political tensions through a masterly
deployment of fish imagery: all dramatis-
ing what I take to be the guiding concern
of the whole work: “Rot and renewal
.. ./Even new life is fuel.”
That there was at the centre of
Lowell's early work a largeness of vision
perhaps only compatible with a truly
religious outlook seems to me undeniable;
and it is equally obvious that the religious
vision has given way to extraordinary
penetrating and accurate psychological

Pritchett in Babylon
New York Proclaimed. V. S. Pritchett.
Chatto and Windus and Heinemann.
£6 3s.
Mr Pritchett, rtovelist and celebrated
critic of “The New Statesman’s” Books
in General, has lately been writing for
“Holiday”, an American magazine edited
on the principle that sustained encomiums
for countries or cities will ensure travel
advertisements, provide wish-fulfilment
for the house-bound, and perhaps give
guidance to those affluent . enough
actually to do the travelling themselves.
“New York Proclaimed”, Mr Pritchett’s
latest book, is written for the most part
in “Holiday” prose: an example occurs
early on, when in looking at the sky-
scrapers of the city for the first time,
Mr Pritchett takes off on a characteristic
flight of fancy which I see has also
caught the eye of A. Alvarez in “The
Spectator”: “The Chrysler glides north-
ward and the Empire State moves
graciously south; soon all are changing
places in a millionaire’s waltz, slow and
silent, male and female, exchanging the
light in their eyes, the touch of roof
and penthouse like passing hands.” This
is the James Morris manner with a
vengeance; but luckily Mr Pritchett has
none of Mr Morris’s finickiness, his
nervous irritability with noise and
bustle. Blissfully airborne, this writer
dares everything, even the slums: he has
sailed through the city from one end to
the other, his poetic pen uncrossed and
his eyes sharp with approval.
This is, of course, a visitor’s view, a
tourist’s; and a tourist, what's more, on
an expense account, with lavish fees
from “Holiday” around a beckoning
corner. We seldom, in this substantial
volume, really get the feeling of the life
of the New Yorker, grappling daily with
his own private metropolis. The prose is
too prettily turned, too decorative quite
to manage the reality of, say, the sub-
way, with its crippled beggars propelling
themselves forward on wooden plat-
forms, its blown litter, white, tense and
suspicious citizens and—for months at
a stretch—infernal heat. Only a Celine,
perhaps, could do it justice.
The best part of the book is the
fascinating and expertly told story of
the history of Gotham. Opening this
section with a thoroughly deserved
tribute to Washington Irving, whose
“Knickerbocker’s History of New York”
is still a most enjoyable guide, Mr Prit-
chett sketches in the origins of a city
older than Australia’s first settlement, a
city which, though it has been rebuilt

many times, still has the feeling of being
old, of having a settled, stratified pattern
of living, solid-as-oak traditions, and
for all its violence and anarchism a
stern basic rectitude with more than a
whiff of the Pilgrim Fathers. Little Old
New York comes alive; the peculiar
Dutch flavor of New Amsterdam —also
most agreeably created in Weill’s music
for “Knickerbocker Holiday”—delicately
restored. Here, and in the account of
New York’s unfolding into the present
terrifying but stimulating Babylon on
the Hudson, Mr Pritchett is admirably
in command.
But the photographs are what the
book will be bought for, and Evelyn
Hofer’s elegantly geometric re-creation
of the city is richly and glossily watch-
able. For the most part, she shows us
an uninhabited place, of an arctic hard-
ness and chill, and one would like to
have seen more shots of the inside of
buildings, of those huge multiple offices
where workers sit 40 or 50 in a row
behind each other, or of the stone corri-
dors, nerves jangling continually in a
vast and impersonal organism. In one
admirable picture, between pages 14 and
15, Miss Hofer shows us a glimpse of
a city intersection that evokes New York
more powerfully than all those massive
objects, and “Midtown Steel” opposite
page 62, is also very fine: a polished
steel escalator rising up into a window
that frames, not sky or trees, but a blank,
empty face of stone. And her pale model
perched over cigarette and coffee at a
drug-store counter, her proud pop artist
in crumpled black and enormous sun-
glasses, her watchful and sharp-eyed
beauty parlor staff—all these are New
York, and bring back the city with a
startling sharpness.
CHARLES HIGHAM
The Search for Love
The Powers on High. Sylvia Bruce. New
Authors Ltd. 265. 6d.
Wild Cat Falling. Colin Johnson. Angus
& Robertson. 225. 6d.
Here are two first novels whose authors
couldn’t be more remote from each
other. Sylvia Bruce, who is 28, is a
product of the British upper middle class,
and of Oxford. Colin Johnson, 26, is a
part-Aborigine from Western Australia:
he acquired his Junior Public certificate
in an orphanage, and graduated later to
the mob who used to be called Bodgies
(in my youth but not in his), and are
now, although his blurb writer doesn’t
seem to know it, called Rockers. It gives
a nostalgic glow to see that old dodo of
a word brought out of mothballs: “an
Aboriginal Bodgie”.
Both Miss Bruce and Mr Johnson
have written of characters who are like
themselves. When an author does this,
he presumably wishes the device re-
spected, and it is incumbent on the
reader to do so instead of pre-
sumptuously muttering “autobiography”
Found at Troy
There was once, at the siege of Troy,
A somewhat aberrated boy,
Who was not up to the event.
When every Greek crept from his tent
To get into that famous horse,
This lad was stricken with remorse
And held proceedings up until
It made wily Odysseus ill.
The strange part was that this same
youth,
So far from being scared, in truth
Occasionally his tunic spread
Where even Ajax feared to tread;
Which was why he had been included.
But all that night he moaned and
brooded,
He wouldn't climb, he wouldn’t stay,
His nay was yea, his yea was nay:
He simply dithered at the brink.
And, worst of all, he seemed to think
Each busy, noble, normal hoplite,
As he made haste to reach the top-flight,
Was wondering why he stood and
moped,
Whereas, in fact, they only hoped
He would at last pul! up his sandal,
Move up the ramp and end the scandal,
And sit down quietly in the ranks
Of his old mates and stop these pranks.
But not at all! What maddening ploy!
“Are you of Hellas or of Troy?"
They asked him—and he didn t know.
“Get in.” they yelled, “you so-and-so.
At last do that, we beg you ... in!
Make up your mind and let's begin!
Leave all the rest till later. We
Just want to shut this horse, you see?”
Well, anyway, he’d found his match
They dragged him in and locked the
hatch.
Three thousand years after the date
When the above took place, blind fate
Brought Schliemann to dig up a layer
Of Troy: the fifth. And there a prayer
At length was answered and fulfilled.
A man was found! The whole great
guild
Of archaeologists was struck
All in a heap. A man. What luck!
A man? Well, hardly. Yet—of sorts.
How very oddly he contorts!
One shrivelled leg was queerly raised
In front of him, the other based
Beneath the potsherds of the mound
Firmly on what was once the ground.
His body’s posture indicated
That he was highly dissipated
In his attention, not to say
Dispersed. His face was turned one way,
His rump the other. What a find!
But which was front and which behind?
Our German was quite mystified.
It seemed the manikin had died
This only Greek to be discovered
As between left and right he hovered,
Or between good and evil, or
Between a neither and a nor,
Or, possibly, a yet and but
That would not open, would not shut.
Still, Schliemann knew a thing or two.
He looked down at the shape and drew
The one conclusion which seemed safe.
“It would appear this timeless waif
Was to himself as deep a riddle
As to his friends . . . split down the
middle.
I doubt a girl transfixed him so:
He doesn't seem the type. You know,
I think he was a poet. Yes,
Who else would get in such a mess?
His trouble must have been that when
He had to choose like other men,
He could not, since his soul, divided,
(As some would claim too many-sided)
Embraced at once King Priam’s cause
And Agamemnon's. No applause
Could dull his tragic sense, which
bloomed
On the awareness that we're doomed
Impartially. Thus he brought discredit
On Troy and Greece.”
As Schliemann said it,
There wafted round his sceptic nose
A scent of hyacinth and rose.

and to judge the character as a
creation. But the reader cannot do this
when the author lets him down; that is,
when the author fails to rear above his
self-reflecting character and cast a cold
eye on him. We should feel the author’s
invisible presence, brooding and judging.
Miss Bruce fails entirely to do this;
Mr Johnson does not fail, but runs
dangerously close to it. And in both
cases their publishers make it difficult
for us to avoid the autobiographical slur,
because of the way they package these
books—they do not allow the authors to
remain invisible. Authors ought to re-
main invisible. In Mr Johnson’s case
there is an excuse. Here is the first Aus-
tralian of Aboriginal descent to write a
novel; his publishers are understandably
enthusiastic, and Mary Durack, who has
been mentor and friend to him since
childhood, and to whom he obviously
owes a lot, has written a long introduc-
tion to this very short book. And because
we want to know about so unusual an
addition to the literary scene, this
biography can’t help but interest us. Miss
Durack’s generous enthusiasm is not to
be brushed aside; yet I wonder if a
biography included with the book doesn’t
do him a disservice, because he is a
serious writer, predominantly European
in consciousness and direction, and one
feels sure that this is how he would
want to be judged, and not as a curiosity.
The frame in which he is mounted makes
this hard.
Brenda, Miss Bruce’s character, is a
female Oxford undergraduate, and the
theme appears to be the search for love.
Yet one experiences no love in this story
except Brenda’s self-love; it is filled with
the most stifling egocentricity. Brenda is
the product of an advanced culture
wound up to the agonised peak of its
refinement, poised on the brink of
decadence: she is complex, articulate,
precocious, schooled in every subtlety of
response to the artistic and intellectual
stimuli her background offers her; and
she is jaded, jaded at 17, and somehow
repellent. She falls in love with Hans,
German and alcoholic, but what she
seems to feel about him mostly is irrita-
tion. So do we. Hans suicides, and
Brenda goes insane. The author’s narra-
tive gift is almost nonexistent, but the
insane passages are convincing: we can
accept the fact here that other people
exist purely to elicit responses from
Brenda. Released, she turns to the last-
ditch solution for the intellectual English
girl for whom the complicated life is a
sellout: she takes a brutal colored lover.
Now at least there is intensity in bed, and
she describes with unction how Krishna
beats her up. He lets her down too, but
in the end there is hope as she contem-
plates Andrew. “There will be room
someday for someone like him I thought,
a patient, warm, inflexible man . .
And so, presumably, Brenda lays down
the Bhagavadgita and picks up “Woman’s
Own” ...
Mr Johnson’s book is slight, and has
a “beat” toughness which is far too
derivatively American and has the
utterly empty sourness of that genre.
Life, we are made to know, is entirely
lousy. But it is nothing so simple as
that, or Mr Johnson wouldn’t bother
writing. Aside from this strain, “Wild
Cat Falling” has a quality which holds
you, and which makes me, at any rate,
care for Mr Johnson as a writer. There
is a tension which springs from the fact
that his part-Aboriginal delinquent is in
a real predicament, and not the manu-
factured one of the self-adoring beat.
Fresh from gaol, the boy turns from the
milk-bar criminals he’s run with until
now and, bristling with defensiveness,
tries the university set. They are de-
lighted with him, but he doesn’t like
them; they moon over him as a prob-
lem, but he wants to be a person. “I
listen to their bulldust questions and
make the sort of answers they expect
55
So he turns from them back to the wild
and bitter release of crime again. One
doesn’t blame him for the reaction but
only for taking it nowhere, to a dead
end. This book is alive, but inconclusive,
and Mr Johnson has yet to grapple wiih
the novelist’s greatest task; creating live
people we can care about. But it is made
into something more than it would other-
wise be by something extraordinary which
happens just before the end.
Hiding from the police in the bush,
the boy meets up with an old, vagrant
Aborigine, whom his mother, fighting to
“live white”, has warned him to avoid
since childhood. He proves to be a blood
relative, and shelters the boy in his
humpy. He is the one impressive
character in the book, with a real and
gentle authority about him. During the
night the boy dreams, and the old. man
tells him the next morning that he’s
been singing in his sleep.
“You know that song, son . . . you
dream it. It belong your country.” The
boy retorts that he belongs nowhere; but
the old man says to him as they part:
“This country knows you all right, son.
You keep to the bush.”
This country knows you. Only Colin
Johnson among Australian writers is
entitled to write that sentence: not “You
know this country”, but: “This country
knows you.” Other Australian writers
may claim kinship with the land; but
Europe haunts our blood, and the land,
as Lawrence saw, does not know us; it
troubles us. In this moment in his book,
when lost tribal spirits reach out wist-
fully for the boy, Johnson lifts it to an-
other level. What direction his talent

6 S 3d
Love and the English. Nina Epton.
Penguin. 6s. 3d.
Love and the Spanish. Nina Epton.
Penguin. 6s. 3d.
What strikes one most forcibly about all
three of Nina Epton’s celebrated books
on the French, English and Spanish
attitudes to love is the neat course she
steers between the scholarly and the
frivolous on the one hand, and the prim
and the salacious on the other. Brought
up on “self-control and hockey”, she
handles her ticklish material with taste
and decorum without shirking the task
she has set herself.
Beginning with the troubadors of the
Middle Ages, Gallic customs relating to
the nuptial couch are traced through
the centuries to the present. The amount
of research has obviously been tremen-
dous and, if her quotes from diaries,
letters, poems, memoirs and fiction have
been chosen chiefly for their entertain-
ment value, this is na cause for complaint
in a book which does not pretend to be
a definitive sociological treatise. Un-
derstandably, practically all the amorous
evidence available up to the 19th century
is centred upon the upper layers of
society with special emphasis on the
scandals of the French Court.
Goaded, she insists, into writing “Love
and the English” by Continental remarks
to the effect that the relevant material
would be sufficient only for a magazine
article, Miss Epton confounds these scep-
tics by producing a work, similar in its
method to the earlier book, which is
equally entertaining and slightly longer.
Her researches, beginning in Anglo-Saxon
times, do not altogether disprove the
popular cliche that Englishmen make
poor lovers, but they do show that the
English have always displayed a lively
interest in the subject.
Whereas her own countrymen were in-
clined to treat her investigations either
as “dirty” or a joke, Miss Epton found
the average Spanish attitude severe or
reserved. Due partly to this reticence, her
method of presentation in “Love and the
Spanish” is slightly dilferent. The first
half of the book is devoted to a chrono-
logical examination of the Spanish lit-
erature of love from Ibn H’azm to Lorca,

The Queue for Money
Local Australian companies are
entitled to be worried about the
big line-up of names from over-
seas which have made plans to raise
money in Australia. It may be a
peculiar sign of inferiority (or ap-
propriate deferment to overseas size
and know-how) but most Australians
give a higher rating to an overseas
name and tend automatically to accept
anyone from abroad.
Entertainment artists are a case in
point. Big fees are paid to overseas
artists and Australian audiences will
flock along. A local would have the
greatest difficulty of commanding a
fraction of such entertainment fees.
Overseas firms with proved tech-
nical background and performance
naturally should achieve some recog-
nition. But when it comes to raising
large slabs of money, it is reasonable
to ask if that money will be put to
the best national use.
It is unfair and myopic to condemn
all overseas efforts to raise money in
Australia, because it is undeniable
that certain organisations are bringing
tremendous national advantages to
Australia. Yet it is just as apparent
that the local money purse is small and
Australia is not such a big nation when
it comes to finding risk money (apart
from straight-out gambling).
In recent weeks we have had
evidence of money-raising efforts by
BP and talk that Ford will be seeking
local funds. Then there was the report
that Hoechst Chemicals (Australia)
Ltd had placed more than £lm. in
ordinary shares and £l.lm. in deben-
tures with Australian institutions.
CRA already has permitted Aus-
tralian investors to have a larger slice
of its mining cake, but at 345. for
the ss. par value shares. Now another
big miner, Consolidated Gold Fields,
is talking of hiving off its Australian
interests into a separate public com-
pany in which Australian investors
might be offered a 35 p.c. to 45 p.c.
interest.
Consolidated’s chairman, Sir George
Harvie - Watt, says that his company
already has invested more than £llm.
in Australia and expects to double this
in the next five years.
Australian investors can’t criticise
the moves of CRA or Consolidated
Gold Fields for offering larger local
participation. They have been asking
for this for years. But all these moves
are coming at once when the overseas
restrictions are designed to rake in
money from these international com-
panies and make it harder for them to
obtain capital funds to remit overseas.
ICIANZ is another case in point
where £6.9m. of 20s. shares is being
offered at 10s. premium which will
lift £ 10.4 m. from various pockets
SIR G. HARYIE-WATT
when the shares are fully paid by June,
1966. Fortunately, a major portion
of this capital is held in the UK.
Against the local demand for com-
pany funds, the Federal Treasurer has
been forced to lower his sights for
overseas borrowing, with the mooted
Euro-dollar loan being scaled down
from the original target of £4om. to
£2sm. Any marked difficulty to raise
Commonwealth loan funds on the
local market inevitably will mean
renewed pressure for higher taxes, and
although the Federal Government has
shown a definite disinclination to inter-
fere with the capital-raising markets,
except through interest rate control
and normal Reserve Bank “freezing”
of trading bank deposits, it might be
forced to step into the arena to request
some preference in the type of money
being raised.
It has refrained from doing this in
the past when the finance and HP
companies were borrowing money
from the public in competition with
bonds, and it still may hold off except
to ask the institutions to use dis-
crimination. But if demands for local
money become too severe, an element
of self preservation arises which could
prompt even higher interest rates or
some form of capital control. All this
must make the banks look longingly
at their frozen deposits with # the
Reserve Bank.
UK Directors Stung
TTk taxes, including the proposed
corporation tax, have stung
Britain’s company directors and many
of them have gone into print, and
criticised Mr Callaghan’s measures
as short sighted. By making it less
profitable to invest abroad, they
claim, the Exchequer is losing sight
of the long-term advantages of invest-
ments which add substantially to UK
reserves.
But Mr Callaghan hasn’t time to be
longsighted at the moment because
he has an urgent crisis on his hands.
BP, in its published chairman’s re-
port, rather self-righteously states that
the Chancellor certainly doesn’t need
to point the finger in the direction of
the green shield, because BP contri-
buted £stg67m. to the UK balance
of payments last year. BP’s overseas
trading, after allowing for new invest-
ment abroad, directly contributed
£stg42m. to Britain’s coffers and this
amount would have been higher but
for the abnormally large Middle East
tax settlements.
Another saving was BP’s imports
of £stg36m. of oil for Britain’s home
market which, the company claims,
would have cost Britain at least
£stg2sm. extra if it had been pur-
chased from a foreign-based company.
BP also points out that its operations
abroad provide export markets for
Britain in the supply of plant, machin-
ery and stores.

chairman of The Rio Tinto-Zinc Cor-
poration, says that in times of financial
stringency it would be better to impose
temporary measures, like LBJ, and he
suggests that future export of capital
could be controlled by the Capital
Issues Committee while allowing a
permanent and meaningful tax “over-
spill” for UK companies operating
abroad.
Mr Duncan points out that, under
the old rules, if a British-owned com-
pany paid overseas tax of 50 p.c., it
obtained a credit for this and paid the
additional UK tax to bring it up to
53.75 p.c. By eliminating the allow-
ance for excess foreign tax above the
British corporation tax rate of 35-40
p.c., there will be a double tax which
will bring the total foreign tax and
UK tax paid to more than 70 p.c., he
says.
This puts UK companies at a dis-
advantage with other international
companies with which they are com-
peting, particularly where special tax
allowances such as the American tax
arrangement permit domestic deple-
tion allowances to apply to an Ameri-
can mining company’s overseas opera-
tions.
Rio Tinto’s chairman gives an
example of his company’s build-up of
investments in Canadian uranium
mines where only 17 p.c. of the 250
million dollar investment came from
the UK. Additionally, he points out
that four projects of the company
would raise a total of 1000 million
dollars in the four years to 1967 out
of which only about £stglBm. has been
invested by the UK.
Yet sales from these projects are
expected to reach between 3000 mil-
lion and 4000 million dollars in the
first 15 years of operations, out of
which 1000 million dollars net would
flow into the sterling area after repay-
ments.

Switching Resources to Defence
What role for import restrictions?
rpHE rumbling criticism of uncontrolled
imports, which led even the United
Farmers and Woolgrowers’ Association
of NSW to call for restrictions in
February, has now become an open
chorus. Manufacturing interests, always
alert for opportunities to mitigate com-
petition from overseas sources of supply,
are shouting loudest.
Veteran manufactures stalwart Mr
C. P. Puzey, Director of the Australian
Industries Development Association, has
joined in with a full-throated cry to jam
the imports door of the “uncontrolled
open economy”.
As usual, Mr Puzey puts things rather
strongly, saying that “selective control
of imports is essential if another serious
credit squeeze is to be avoided”. He
thinks that “if the Government persists
with general financial restrictions as the
only means to correct the balance of
trade, it must take action which will
seriously affect all industry”. In his view
it seems that a credit squeeze is inevit-
able if import restrictions are not im-
posed.
In effect what Mr Puzey seems to be
saying is that present monetary policy
will prove powerless to prevent a balance
of payments crisis and, in a word, “We
must now call on the vigor and power of
local industry to provide us with the
goods we can no longer afford to import.”
Furthermore, Mr Puzey thinks “the
ability of manufacturing to do this is
clearly evident”.
Mr Puzey believes this applies to
defence equipment as well as to other
products. Looking back to the last war,
he thinks the war-time role of manu-
facturing industry has tended to be for-
gotten . . . “At that time Australia de-
veloped the production of a whole range
of military supplies, starting with a manu-
facturing structure primitive by today’s
standards”, he says, “but now we have
the resources to produce high-grade
defence equipment, and all local industry
needs is orders and loyal support”.
However attractive that proposition
may sound to local manufacturers at
present fully employed and suffering
from credit stringency combined with
intensive competition from imports
(which Mr Puzey sees as one of the main
causes of strains on local credit and bank
liquidity), I am reminded of the words of
approval from the Metal Trades As-
sociation when, at their annual dinner in
Melbourne, the Federal Treasurer, Mr
Holt, announced he was ordering a
further £165 million worth of defence
equipment from the United States. The
chairman said simply that in the present
C. P. PUZEY
strained condition of the local metal
trades, particularly the shortage of labor,
it would be virtually impossible to have
met the orders-in this country, so he was
thankful. By general admission such
defence orders are going to weigh among
the heaviest items against the balance of
payments over the next few years.
As I see it, there is no point in bemoan-
ing the fact that these orders are going
abroad while resources are not available
to meet them at home. It is rather a
matter of deciding whether local manu-
facturing has to be cut back in other
directions to make way for more defence
production in the light of balance of
payments possibilities. There is nothing
in Mr Puzey’s treatment of the subject
to suggest that he has that in mind, but
possibly he does, because to him the
balance of payments outlook is serious.
Certainly, if we are to produce more
of our defence requirements here, it is
quite obvious that this could be
done by diverting presently fully em-
ployed resources in that direction. But
this would not necessarily mean that the
strain on the balance of payments would
be much reduced. To some, and prob-
ably a great extent, it might only mean
a switch from some types of imports to
others. On the other hand it would entail
a reduction in non-defence imports and,
given the more buoyant internal activity
which would doubtless follow from giving
defence a higher priority in local pro-
duction, this might be exceedingly dif-


ficult to accomplish without imposing
import restrictions on non-defence im-
ports.
Indeed, though Mr Puzey doesn’t
mention it, the need to provide more
resources, be they internal or from our
overseas funds, for defence is at the heart
of the question whether import restric-
tions should be considered. True
enough, with non-defence industry Tun-
ing so strongly the strain on overseas
reserves for that reason alone is sufficient
for the question to be fully ventilated
just now. But it is surely the defence
angle, looked at in the dual light of pro-
ducing more defence equipment at home
and buying more from overseas funds,
which highlights it at this juncture. It
is not simply a matter of whether import
controls are an appropriate alternative
to monetary restrictions to keep the
economy on an even keel and to stave
off balance of payments stringencies for
a peace-time economy looking at defence
in splendid isolation.
From the look of events in Vietnam
one would imagine that the time is over-
due for considering the orientation of
resources more strictly in terms of de-
fence, that is direct defence, and some-
what less in terms of rising living stan-
dards and indirect defence such as
general development, social investment,
foreign aid and so on which have been
allowed to have top priority here for, in
my view, far too long. For that reason
I find it difficult to stomach the detailed
argument which Mr Puzey puts forward
to bolster the case of local manufacturers
against imports. It is a bit behind the
dangerous modern hour.
This is not to say that much of the
matter assembled on the general subject
of local manufacturing, import replace-
ment and the possible need for import
restrictions in Mr Puzey’s contribution
is not of general interest or that some of
it isn’t apposite to the present situation.
Inter cilia, he demonstrates that rather
than having made an inordinate contri-
bution to market supplies, imports have
been completely overshadowed by the
increases in local manufacturing in-
dustry. This is presumably put up more
to applaud the achievements of local in-
dustry” than as underplaying the nuisance
element in imports from the local manu-
facturers’ point of view. The inference
is that as local industry has made so
much headway in the past it can conquer
still higher and better worlds in the
future.
He also shows that, thanks largely to
vigorous import replacement, over the
medium term period our dependence on
imports has not increased relatively to
the rise in the national product. How-
ever, it has to be recognised that this
is not the case over the last year or so
when the imports bill has risen pro-
portionately more than for many years
this year’s bill is expected to be near
£l4OO million compared with £llB6
million in 1963-64, a rise of about 18£
p.c. or almost three times the expected
rise of possibly 6i p.c. in GNP.
Mr Puzey is on contentious ground in
saying that much of our present imports
is “unessential” even if it is probably
true in the sense that if we had the re-
sources available for replacing many
imports with local production we could,
at a price, reduce the imports bill. In a
good many cases, at any rate in present
conditions here, the price would he too
high to make the exercise worthwhile for
potential manufacturers, not to speak of
local consumers. In any case, Mr Puzey
appears to place less than its due im-
portance on the essentiality of the huge
element of overseas purchases of local
raw materials and producers’ goods for
local industry.
He makes a lot of the comparative
level of assistance to primary and
secondary industry, citing most of the
arguments we have had before from his
pen. The corollary, of course, is that in
his view tariff protection accorded local
secondary industry is a modest flower in
itself, and especially in relation to the
sizeable special support to primary in-
dustry.
Rounding off his special pleading for
secondary industry, he makes, a pretty
good case for saying that manufacturing
industry contributes more to exports
than is generally supposed or can be
gleaned from the official figures.
He says there is a very large manu-
facturing content in a whole range of
other goods. A multitude of processes
classified as manufacturing, and the
workers engaged therein classified as
factory workers, are involved in exports
from butter and flour to wine and metals.
CROESUS
The Aluminium Horoscope
A metal on the move
of the industrial miracles per-
A formed here since the war have
captured the imagination more vividly
than the one in aluminium. One first
grasped its national (particularly balance
of payments) significance when Comalco
was formed to take over the small Com-
monwealth-controlled refinery at Bell Bay
in 1960. This has been drummed in on
subsequent visits to that plant—in the
throes of rapid expansion in 1962, also
to see Mr Bolte turn the first aluminium
spadeful on Alcoa's then bare, pleasant
pastures site at Port Henry in December,
1961, and, more recently, to go over the
latter's bauxite fields and alumina re-
finery in Western Australia. Finally,
there was last week's Press tour to inspect
the smelter, fabricating units and new
wharf at Port Henry in the full flush
of operation.
Yet these are but flashes in the in-
dustry’s horoscope. For instance, in
Northern Australia, Comalco's Weipa
bauxite field, whence bauxite exports
have been pouring through the new port
for some time, is on the threshhold of
vast new development to serve a huge
600,000-ton alumina refinery at Glad-
stone. In its turn, Alcoa, with a brand
new contract from American Metal Cli-
max for 200,000 metric tons a year of
alumina, is to almost double its capacity
to 410,000 tons a year at the Kwinana
refinery which is already sending alumina
in big quantities to Japan as well as Port
Henry. Furthermore, export markets
have opened up for metal and products
for both integrated groups to provide out-
lets for metal surplus to the rising cur-
rent requirements of some 60,000 tons
plus a year in the home market.
Beyond all this, but faint as yet, a
new vista is forming around the Gove
bauxite deposits in the Northern Terri-
tory where the giant French aluminium
group, Pechiney, is pathfinding among
the outer deposits of the field at the
moment. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment is pondering a decision as to who
will get rights over the inner deposits
whose lease British Aluminium relin-
quished last year. The likely mixture at
Gove is still opaque but at the least an
alumina refinery is in distinct prospect
at this field with vague suggestions of a
station for nuclear power to smelt the
product there and others to smelt it at
Newcastle. A decision as to which in-
terests get the lease is expected soon. The
possibles include Swiss Aluminium and
Reynolds Metal (US). Coupled in vari-
ous combinations with substantial local
interests such as BHP, CSR. the AMP,
The ‘'Wales'’, MLC and other big insti-
tutions. At worst, Australian interests
seem likely to get a strong minority
interest.
With Gove still all to play for, and
smelting capacity of the two established
groups 92,000 tons of metal a year
(52,000 Comalco and 40,000 Alcoa) com-
pared with local current consumption of
something just under 65,000 tons a year,
interest in the industry is mainly concen-
trated on securing and expanding mar-

kets at home and overseas. Integral to
this task, of course, is the vital question
of costs. As well as the drive to reduce
raw material, power and labor costs in
the production of metal, both groups are
now being increasingly faced with cost
problems arising from their greater con-
centration now on fabricating. In that
area they are more at the mercy of the
notoriously high Australian cost of labor
and transport than in their basic refining
and smelting processes. Moreover it is a
highly competitive area with old hands
like Australuco in the field.
The competitive struggle for the local
market has been as intense as one
expected it to be when, in March, 1963,
on the eve of smelting starting up at
Port Henry, Alcoa announced it would
cut the price to £251 a ton in face of
Comalco's established £271 under the
Commonwealth agreement. Obviously,
although local consumption of the metal
has lifted by about 20,000 tons a year
to its present 64,000 tons since 1962,
with 92,000 tons of capacity available it
would still be some years, perhaps until
1970, before the home market could con-
sume all that both groups could produce.
Since 1962, it has been rather a question
of how much of the market Alcoa could
snatch from Comalco and importers
(mainly of US and Canadian metal).
From what I’m told, Alcoa is quite satis-
fied at the progress it has made and is
pushing on.
Two things have assisted Alcoa’s own
strong marketing methods and previously
booked connections in getting into the
local market. One was undoubtedly
Comalco’s production set-back at Bell
Bay in 1963 when part of its plant had
to be shut down and power supplies
were interrupted. The other was the
rapid growth of the market itself. This
growth was, of course, to a large extent
a result of the strong rise in general
economic activity to full employment
levels. But it also owed a great deal to
the vigorous promotion of the aluminium
image, the development of an aluminium
, consciousness by advertising and by the
hard selling by both groups of aluminium
as a metal to potentially big users in com-
petition with suppliers of other materials.
One doesn’t know to what extent trade
discounts have figured in the marketing
play but in the conditions pertaining in
some of the big customer trades, such
as building, there has presumably been
plenty of scope for it.
If only because economic fluctuations
must be expected, it would surprise if
the local market succeeded in reaching
the targets set for it by the companies
in the next few years. Mr J. Colin Smith,
managing director of Alcoa, told me there
were some big potential users to book,
especially in the cables field. If some of
these were won over to the metal there
would be a good chance of full expecta-
tions being realised. It must be remem-
bered, though, that in 1961 v a recession
year when building (which accounts for
more than a third of aluminium usage
here) as well as general fixed investment
were badly hit, consumption here drop-
ped by 8000 tons to 36,000 tons. This
sort of movement, although against the
strong long-term upward trend, could
hold up the industry’s progress towards
raising per head consumption from the
present 1241 b. a year to the envisaged
22-241 b. a year by 1970 (consumption in
the US is 361 b. a head and in Britain
181 b.).
Undoubtedly the question of price
looms large in the minds of manage-
ment setting its high expansion targets
for consumption as much as it does with
the customers. At any rate the price of
some products should fall. For instance,
an executive of Alcoa told me that it
expects the price of foil to come down
when it starts marketing the product
from the new foil mill now nearly ready
to roll at Port Henry.
In these circumstances the greatest
hope for cost reductions would probably
lie in getting power costs down. These
would be from 15 to 30 p.c. of total cost,
I was told. Alcoa refuses to be drawn
on the price it pays the SEC for its pre-
sent power but it is unlikely to be as
low as the 4d. a Kw. Ccmalco pays for
its hydro power in Tasmania. However,
Alcoa believes it will produce power at
much less than it is at present paying the
SEC when its projected 150 megawatt
power station is operating at Anglesea
on brown coal (I visited this site which
is being prepared— not with much visible
sign—for the erection of the power sta-
tion which is expected to be in commis#
sion by 1969).
Another potential cost-saver is seen in
the production of carbon anodes, Which
I was told is about 10 p.c. of total
costs at the Port Henry smelter. At pre-
sent the main ingredients used to make
the anodes are two petroleum products
not yet produced by Australian oil re-
fineries. These have to be imported from
the US. Their production here could
mean lower costs for producing anodes
and., in any case, a saving of foreign
exchange.

“Back to boiled mutton and damper”?
T|/¥r B. A. Santamaria has accused the
Wool Board, the Wheat Board and
the Reserve Bank of tampering with
Australia’s defence policy by negotiating
deals with the Red Chinese. He has
suggested That the time will come when
the Red Chinese will indicate that the
attitude of the trading government will
be taken into consideration when
making arrangements to purchase wheat
or wool. Mr Santamaria is surely being
naive.
It can confidently be imagined that
the commissar in charge of the People's
Bank (whoever he may be) would
already feel that he had much in com-
mon with Dr H. C. Coombs, chairman
and governor of Australia’s Reserve
Bank. If that is taken entirely as a joke
then it isn’t meant to be—not entirely.
As someone else has already said:
“While politicians do the proposing,
economics does the disposing.” Trade
with Red China is an established fact.
The Reserve Bank, the Wheat Board and
the Wool Board are established facts.
The personalities involved, Dr Coombs,
Mr J. V. Moroney (Wheat Board) and
Sir William Gunn (Wool Board and
International Wool Secretariat), are in-
cidental, although each could doubtless
be shown to have had a strong hand in
what has come to be established fact.
What is in need of revision are popu-
lar attitudes to such words as socialism,
nationalisation and private enterprise.
There is no such thing as a completely
socialistic, or nationalistic, or private
enterprise economy any more. Some
economies are more one than the other.
The United States has measures which
are socialistic and even in Red China
there are some private-enterprise firms
still in existence.
There will be people who will not be-
lieve this, hut this, too, happens to be an
established fact. That is why clear
thinking about our trading relations with
Red China is imperative. In order that
this can come about it is even more,
imperative that there be clear thinking
about the trends in- Australian farming
which opponents (in a minority) continue
to refer to as socialism. A better
description would be welfarism or ser-
vice-statism.
The majority of primary producers
have shown clearly that they want prices
protection, marketing protection, and
government assistance in a variety of
ways. Some have it more than others.
The only primary industry which con-
tains an element of opposition to this
general thesis is the wool industry. Even
the wool industry, it could be argued,
has a good measure of these things in
any case. The marketing of wool is the
one great holdout against this general
trend. 1
Those opponents of the Wool Board’s
reserve price marketing scheme who
believe that by opposing this scheme they
can somehow preserve what is supposed
to be private enterprise in farming are
hardly being realistic. If they are right
they are right at tho wrong time. They
should have made their play twenty or
thirty years ago when all the other mar-
keting boards (dairy, wheat, eggs, dried
fruit, and so on) were coming into exist-
ence. The two w'orld wars shouldn’t
have happened, either. The clock can-
not be turned back..
What can be done, however, is to
make certain that the clock keeps time.
Producer boards are here to stay and
will get stronger, not weaker. These
boards are no less liable to abuse than
the private enterprise system which they
replaced. They can be inefficient,
costly, moribund and remote. Produ-
cers have it in their hands to see that
these things do not happen and that
their boards are efficient.
W. J. VINES
A classic example of remoteness occurs
■L* in the reply by Mr W. J. Vines
(director of the International Wool
Secretariat) to criticisms levelled by this
writer at the efficiency of the IWS Wool-
mark programme. Mr Vines stated
that the IWS reveals in detail its plans
to the Australian Wool Industry Con-
ference, which “represents the wool-
grower organisations”.
The Wool Industry Conference, in
fact, represents only two of three wool-
grower organisations and represents not
at all 40 p.c. of woolgrowers who do
not belong to any of the three organisa-
tions. The fact that it represents grow-
ers, but is not representative of growers,
is one of the major causes of the cur-
rent troubles affecting the industry. It
is a running sore and must, eventually,
be attended to.
Despite this, and other basic short-
comings, only a very small section of
growers would even contemplate doing
away with the IWS and the Wool Board
and the Wool Industry Conference alto-
gether.
Such a minority section does exist.
It argues, with some justification, that
the IWS is giving South African and
New Zealand woolgrowers ' (minor
financial supporters) a free ride at the
expense of the Australian grower. But
this minority section is not likely to
make headway.
No one, not even this minority, has
come out publicly with what is the best
objection to producer boards, con-
trolled marketing and guaranteed prices.
This objection has to do with land prices.
Because of the measure of affluence
which results from these control# very
few people go broke on the land these
days. That’s w'hat producers want.
The move to have Section 92 of the
Constitution amended will, if successful,
consolidate the position of producer
marketing boards. Those that are"
strongly in control now —dairying and
wheat —will be stronger still. Those
that suffer from loopholes—canned
fruits and eggs—will have the loopholes
plugged.
Commodities which are not con-
trolled, meat and fresh fruits and vege-
tables, would be in a position to readily
implement marketing controls. Wool, in
which interstate trading is negligible,
would nevertheless be almost certain to
adopt some form of controlled market-
ing because part of the suggested amend-
ment is that if three-fifths of any group
of producers decide on something re-
lated to marketing then the Federal
Government shall enact it as law. The
Government shall also have power to
decide who is eligible to vote on such
matters and on the method by which
the vote is taken.
On a three-fifths majority, straight-out
vote, the reserve price plan would be
not a certainty, perhaps, but definitely
a likely winner.
The whole background to this move
to have Section 92 amended is so hazy,
and the general terms so vague, that a
full and detailed explanation on the part
of its formulators is clearly desirable.
Condemning it out of hand as socialistic
and bureaucratic isn’t going to help
much. What do those words mean any-
way? They mean different things to
different people.
The sorry truth seems to be that any
economic policy is justifiable provided

the eventual payment for it is deferred
on to the shoulders of generations of
yet unborn Australians. They, along
with present generations discovering the
myths of private enterprise in Australia,
will have to learn to live with it.
The least we can do is to get some
semblance of order and cohesion in our
apparently insatiable urge to cause a
hardening of the arteries in farming
along with industry, commerce, banking
and education. The urge is there and
the hardening of the arteries seems to
happen regardless of intentions. Pretend-
ing that this urge does not exist is no
way out. Any way you look at it, Aus-
tralians have a great capacity for
bureaucracy.
We should face this reality and be the
more determined to infuse positive pur-
pose and initiative into our self-imposed
welfarism. This will entail not only a
closer interest on the part of farmers
and the public generally but a greater
acceptance of responsibility. Farmers
will have to insist that their boards are
efficient. The public will have to insist
that taxation moneys are not increasingly
absorbed in subsidising inefficient farm-
ing operations.
In the service state there is no reason
why private initiative should be
strangled, although it can happen. What
matters is the quality of the system. It
is worth remembering that we would be
in a sorry mess at the present moment
had not Mr Moroney gone to Peking
and had not Dr Coombs worked out a
way the Chinese could pay for our
wheat on terms. If Sir William Gunn,
along with Dr Coombs, can work out
some way the Red Chinese can buy
large quantities of wool then we will sell
it to them —make no mistake.
What else can we do? Go back to
wearing blucher boots and eating boiled
mutton and damper? No motor cars,
no hi-fi, no holidays at the beach, no
transistors, no surfboards, and no TV
sets out of which Mr Santamaria (and
others) can reach their public. Obviously
we couldn’t go back to the pioneering
days even if we happened to want to.
Today’s hedonistic society clearly does
not want to in any case.
Other than this retrogression, there
appears only two alternatives to the
trend towards complete producer con-
trol of marketing through boards and
neither is very attractive. The simplest
alternative is for higher prices for pri-
mary produce (say 100 p.c. higher) and
the great urban populations would re-
sist this. The other is complete removal
of the family unit from the farming
scene and replacement by vast factory-
farms operated by managers and
various grades of employees in the same
way that steel factories are operated or
collective farms in Russia and China.
It is a difficult world we live in.

TOYOTA have built the Lite-Stout for those who want a
really tough, hard-working, truck-size ute that has sedan
car comfort for three passengers—truly rugged but refined.
Utilities made from passenger cars just can’t carry the
truck-type loads like the TOYOTA Lite-Stout—its big load
area carries more than a ton. TOYOTA’S tough 65 B.H.P.
engine is really reliable—with lots of torque low down to
pull the big loads easily.
Under normal working conditions, loaded to capacity,
Lite-Stout gives up to 28 miles per gallon—32 m.p.g. on
light loads. The big brakes with finned drums give more
braking and less fade under heavy loads than any truck
at any price.
Easy handling, panoramic curved windscreen and passen-
ger car ride bring an entirely new feel to truck driving.
At only £1,058, TOYOTA toughness in the chassis, solid
reliability in the motor, economy on the go, Lite-Stout
gives you more for your money than any utility on the road
today.
See your TOYOTA dealer—he has what you want in trucks
TOYOTA Lite-Stout is available with either steel tray
(List Price £955 plus tax), wooden tray (List Price £965
plus tax) or cab and chassis (List Price £BB5 plus tax).
Girder-type chassis makes Lite-Stout especially suitable
for mounting special bodies.

INVESTMENT
A Morsel from Weston
A long wait for very little
A fter waiting several years for the
flotation of George Weston Foods
Ltd, the UK-based flour, bread, cake
and biscuit group, investors now find that
only one million of the 40 million
issued ss. ordinary shares are being
made available at Bs. 6d. a share.
It appears that Australian and New
Zealand institutions and various associ-
ates already hold about 17i p.c. of the
£lO million issued capital, and the latest
placement, through lan Potter & Co.,
will bring the public holding up to' 20
p.c.
Most of the placement is believed to
represent shares from the parent group,
Associated British Foods Ltd, London.
The forecast 7 p.c. dividend would pro-
vide a dividend yield of 4.1 p.c. at the
placement price of Bs. 6d. and an earn-
ings yield of 7.1 p.c., with the first
interim dividend due in September.
Last year’s consolidated profit of
£l.2m. was equal to 12.1 p.c. on capital
and was gained from sales of £32.8m.
Since coming to Australia in 1949,
with the takeover of Gartrell White, the
Weston group has shown expansionist
tendencies, including the purchase of
control in W. Thomas and Co. (WA)
Ltd and N. B. Love Industries Ltd.
It now has 72 Australasian subsidiaries,
including eight in New Zealand, and
employs about 6400 people.
It is well connected with the Aus-
tralian United Corporation Ltd of Mel-
bourne and this association no doubt will
be of vital assistance to the directors in
their plans to continue a policy of
diversification.
Whirlwind result
Considering the company’s poor per-
formance in the last few years, the
Cyclone Co. of Australia’s interim in
February was pleasant reading indeed.
Profit in the December half-year had
come out at £520,000, well above the
£371.000 for the whole of 1963-64,
while the interim dividend was lifted
from 4 p.c. to 5 p.c. Now the board
has followed up this good news with a
report for the nine months to March 31,
stating that profits and sales are still
being maintained at the higher levels and
confirming that the recent interim divi-
dend foreshadowed a 10 p.c. distribu-
tion for the full year.
This would bring the payment back
to the 1961-62 rate which 9.5 p.c. earn-
ings failed narrowly to cover. In the
following two years 8 p.c. was paid from
earnings of 8.2 p.c. in 1962-63 and 11.4
p.c. in 1963-64. The highest recent pay-
ment was 121 p.c. in 1960-61.
Last year’s earnings of . 11.4 p.c. will
come very close to being trebled in the
current year. After an audit, the result
for the December half came out at
£536,000, equalling 33 p.c. on capital
calculated on an annual basis. Sales for
the six months were up by 23 p.c.
However, the directors say that the
effort reflects to some extent a low tax
provision, made possible by the past
losses of a subsidiary, Cyclone K-M
Products. These losses contributed to

the poor performances of the past few

calculated on a normal tax basis, the
current year would still show a signifi-
cant recovery.
Building expansion

. .
j\ KC Industries private placement of
£1 million worth of 7! p.c. un-
secured notes certainly illustrates the
directors belief that the building in-
dustry will continue along its present
buoyant lines for some time to come.
They mature in June, 1980. The funds
will be used mainly to pay for the
continuation of the current extensive
capital expenditure programme.
Not quite a year ago, the group raised
£2.1 million with a two-for-five issue of
ss. shares at a 2s. 6d. premium. These
shares did not rank for the 1963-64
dividend of a steady 74 p.c. from earn-
ings which equalled 18.9 p.c. on capital.
The big increase in ranking capital for
the current year should not affect this
figure to any great extent if the expected
lift in profit comes about. According
to the interim report, sales in the
December half-year jumped 30 p.c. and
profit margins were maintained. There
was every indication that the situation
would continue for the remainder of the
year. To guard against a shortage of
raw materials, orders had been placed to
import wire and steel. This factor plus
a labor shortage suggests, however, that
any further turnover increases in the
current year may not be accompanied
by maintained profit margins.
Another Entrant
the field is already con-
sidered overcrowded another com-
pany is to enter into the air-conditioning
business. However, this one is aiming
at specialised markets including public
transport and the automotive field.
Styled Pye-Tempair Air Conditioning
Pty Ltd, the company is a merger of two
publicly listed companies-—Pye Industries
Ltd and Rootes (Australia) Ltd.
The company will operate as a subsi-
diary of Pye Industries Ltd. Managing
director of Pye, Mr P. M. Threlfall, said
the company would provide high quality
air conditioning equipment for domestic
and industrial applications, apart from
the two fields mentioned before.
He added that Pye’s marketing facili-
ties were immediately available to the
new' company, thus eliminating delay in
placing the air conditioning units on the
market.
A repeat from CRA?
Conzinc Riotinto Australia's
record 1964 profit was earned with
the aid of high world metal prices, chair-
man of the group, Sir Maurice Mawby,
feels CRA should have another profit-
able and successful year in 1965.
Profit for 1964 leaped from £3.813,122
to £5,887,699 and pushed earning rate
up to 42.4 p.c. In his report Sir Maurice
says continuance of the present high
metal prices might not be in the group's
best interests. “At these high prices
there is a grave danger of other materials
being substituted for lead and zinc in
traditional uses and a severe inhibition
on entry of these metals into new
applications,” he said.
He says CRA has the firm prospect
of strengthened earning power and con-
tinued growth with a much wider spread
of interests than lead and zinc.
Glen Iris' best
Tl/l el bourne-based Glen Iris Brick
Holdings has belied expectations by
scoring its best profit since listing in
1961. In the year to February 28 last,
net profit rose from £28,000 to £38,000
and earnings from 7.9 p.c. to 11.4 p.c.
The dividend is unchanged at last year’s

because its poor figures were produced
in favorable conditions for the trade and
despite investment allowances absolving
the company from tax on the year.
The indifferent performance was con-
tinued in the first half of the latest year
when (to the end of August) profit
dropped from £20,000 to £16,000 and
the interim dividend stayed at the still un-
inspiring rate of 23 p.c. It seemed that
the falling profits would allow a divi-
dend of only 5 p.c. for the full year.
Just as last year’s result was even
weaker than it looked because no tax
was necessary, the latest profit is
relatively better than it looks because
it has been calculated after making allow-
ance for taxes of £31,000.
The company operates kilns at Oak-
leigh and Bulleen, and the 1963-64
troubles were primarily the result of
problems experienced in the early opera-
tion of integrated European clay prepara-
tion and brick-making plants. Apparently
these have all been ironed out and new
plants are more than earning their keep.
Uranium expires
np H E fall from £373,000 to £170,000
A in the profit of United Uranium
NL for the year to December 31 reflects
the dilemma now facing the group’s
directors. The contract with the UK
Atomic Energy Authority has been com-
pleted and the board is seeking profitable
employment for the existing technical
and financial resources until uranium
mining is resumed. If commercial de-
mand increases at present rates, this may
be economically possibly by 1970.
Until a definite policy is formulated
for the future of the company, every
effort is being made to conserve funds.
Nevertheless, a steady dividend of 2s.
has been declared on the ss. shares. In
all, payments from uranium operations
have, been 9s. a share or £l3 million,
so shareholders have little to complain
about.
Actual income in the latest year fell
from £992,000 to £643,000. Production
required by the UK contract was finished
in August. The plant has now been
converted to extract gold from mill
residues, and the uranium mines are on
a care-and-maintenance basis.
Investor s good year
IVTost of the Press reports on the
results of Howard Smith for the
year to December 31 tended to make
the performance of this investor in the
coal, shipping and sugar industries look
rather better than it actually was. Profit
was almost doubled from £675,000 to
£1,232,000, and earning rate jumped
from 16.1 p.c. to around 23 p.c. on
capital inflated by the takeover of A.
Goninan during the year and after the
deduction of the usual £15,000 for
preference dividends.
However, as the directors pointed out,
the figure was £357,000 higher than
could normally be expected because of
the changes in the balance dates of
several subsidiaries. It reflected an
additional season’s earnings from sugar
milling, a half-year’s profit from A.
Goninan and an extra three months’
operation by the Invincible Colliery.
Therefore the year’s “true” profit was
only £875,000, still a considerable in-
crease over 1963’s £675,000. But if one
bothers to calculate an earning rate on
this figure it will be found that the rate
has actually eased back from 16.1 p.c.
to 16 p.c. This rather salient point was
not hit on by the newspapers or, if it
was, played down as rather unimportant.
Perhaps this is the correct way to
regard the static earnings anyway. The
group has still to settle down to a certain
extent after the year’s expansion. The
current year’s profits will be boosted by
the higher dividends from BHP in which
it is the largest single shareholder. And
quite apart from this, Howard Smith is
a well-known stater of “conservative”
profits and creator of “hidden” or
“secret” reserves. The latest accounts
show up what must be one of the best
nest-eggs investments in listed com-
panies appear in the books at £3.5 mil-
lion but their actual market value at
balance date was £6.2 million.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
How to Value
Southern Cross
Shares?
There are difficulties in the
agreement
rpHE half-yearly report of Southern
-*• Cross Properties Ltd, issued at the
beginning of February, did not offer any
real prospects of profitability in the near
future, although it stated that there had
been an improvement in the trading
results. During 1965 to date, share
prices have ranged from 2s. down to
Is. 6d., and the recent price has been
Is. 9d. It can only be said that there
are many difficulties encountered in
placing a value on these shares.
Some financial comment seems to lay
the blame for the lack of profits at the
door of the management agreement be-
tween Intercontinental Hotels Corpora-
tion of Australia Pty Ltd and Southern
Cross Properties Ltd. This agreement
provided that IHC of Australia should
retain 25 p.c. of the gross operating
profit from its operations on the site, the
other 75 p.c. being paid to the company
as rental for the hotel. Provision was
also made for the establishment of a
special reserve fund in accordance with
the sub-lease. In the prospectus it was
stated: “All net revenue (including what
would otherwise be received by IHC
Australia) derived from shop rentals and
parking areas will be paid into this
special reserve fund until it is in credit
to the extent of £300.000, and there-
after such proportion of the revenue as
is necessary to maintain the fund at
£300,000.” On the face of it this was
not, and does not, seem a very onerous
agreement when it is considered that
IHC Australia completely manages the
hotel and has also subscribed £600,000
to the ordinary capital of the company.
The real problem seems to lie in the
estimates made regarding the profit-
ability of the hotel. These estimates
suggested that the “hotel gross operating
profit” would be £1,144,000 with a 75
p.c. occupancy rate and £1.224,600 with
an 80 p.c. occupancy rate. In other words,
room operating profit would be between
£2650 and £2830. To obtain an idea
of the significance of these figures, it is
worth mentioning that they are approxi-
mately double the room revenue of

Hotels of Australia in 1962-63. Clearly,
a city hotel has greater avenues for
making profits than a motel even if that
motel is situated in an inner city area.
But, on the other hand, a motel does not
have such high operating costs as a first-
class hotel. Unfortunately, it is not
known whether the original estimates
quoted in the prospectus included shop
and parking profits but, even if they did,
the effect is unlikely to be significant.
The preliminary statement issued last
September stated that the hotel had
made, subject to audit, an operating profit
of £366,908. Seventy-five p.c. of this
figure would be £275,181, but it was
stated at the same time that the rental
payable by IHC Australia amounted to
£318,491. Whether it can be assumed
that -net income from shops and parking
amounted to £43,310 is difficult to say.
However, it is very clear that room
operating profit is down very sub-
stantially on the original estimates. At
about £B5O per room, it is less than a
third of the 75 p.c. occupancy figure
estimate.
If we ignore the management charge,
the net profit before tax, depreciation
and interest on loans, according to the
prospectus estimates, would have shown
a return on the funds to be invested of
between 21.4 p.c. and 23.0 p.c. If we
accept that charge as a cost, the return
would have been between 15.7 p.c. and
17.0 p.c. These rates are rather like
those being obtained by the Windsor
Hotel on funds which were" mainly in
pre-war money. It is only possible to
assume that the promoters considered
that a modern hotel would command
tariffs so much higher that they would be
able to overcome the disad,vantage of
having to build at the costs applicable
to 1960-1962.
Hotel accommodation in Melbourne
is regarded as more in excess of demand
than in Sydney. Apart from this, it
seems to me that the prospects and
performance of Southern Cross Proper-
ties can be directly compared with those
of Wynyard Holdings. Both companies
receive revenue from shops and parking
as well as from the hotel. In both cases,
the hotel is managed by another party
(Federal Hotels in the case of Wynyard
Holdings) who also has a share interest
in the company. The only difference
would seem to be that Wynyard Holdings
started with an established bar trade and
part of the shops. It might also be
possible that the management agreement
between Wynyard Holdings and Federal
Hotels was on a rather different basis.
For the purpose of this comparison, I
have taken actual years of 1962-63 for
Southern Cross and 1963-64 for Wynyard
because the Melbourne hotel was
opened in August, 1962, but the Sydney

one was not opened until October, 1963.
It is now a matter of record that, even
after a full year’s operation of the hotel,
Southern Cross is not yet profitable, but
Wynyard Holdings looks like achieving a
profit in 1964-65 that will not be too far
away from the prospectus forecast after
making a profit—albeit a small one—in
1963-64. It is also worth pointing out
that both the forecast and the actual
figures show profits after deducting any
management charges. While there might
well have been some doubt whether two
roughly comparable projects (judged in
retrospect) could show such similar
results when one had to pay out 25 p.c.
of its gross operating revenue as a
management charge, the crucial point is
why should there now be such a big
difference in the results.

As stated in the article on Wynyard
Holdings, there is reason to believe that
net profit before tax, depreciation,
amortisation and interest on loans will
be close to £BOO,OOO. From the half-
yearly report of Southern Cross, the
gross operating profit of the hotel seems
unlikely to exceed £500,000. This would
mean that, even if we ignore the pay-
ments to IHC Australia, the net operating
profit of Wynyard Holdings would be
twice that of Southern Cross Properties.
This discussion can only be of quite
theoretical interest to Southern Cross
Properties’ shareholders for they will
have already noted that the hotel’s gross
operating profit will need to double
before they are likely to receive even a
5 p.c. dividend.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
A National Consolidation
From radiators to greeting cards
vast industrial and manufacturing
group operating today as National
Consolidated Ltd started its life as a
proprietary company, manufacturing
automotive radiators, back in December,
1937. It was converted to a public
company in August, 1948, but it was not
until 1957 that the diversification and
expansion characteristic of today’s group
started. In that year, Motor Radiators
of New Zealand was acquired and, in
addition, a new subsidiary was estab-
lished in that country to manufacture
initial equipment for radiators. The
group, as it stood then in Australia and
NZ, comprises the National division of
overall activities today. It manufactures
automotive radiator assemblies, replace-
ment radiator cores, car heaters, loco-
motive radiators, fuel tanks, oil coolers,
aerosol valves and metal pressings.
There are seven divisions in all at
present. Strangely enough, the National
division which was the beginning and
basis of all of them, is not the most
important. Of the 3000-odd employees
it has about 850 on its staff whereas the
Bearing Service division has 880. It
comprises nine subsidiaries, but the BS
division comprises 15. Of the nine, three
are incorporated in Victoria, and two in
NSW and NZ. and one in Queensland
and WA. Of the 15, five are incorpor-
ated in NSW. four in Victoria, and two
in Queensland. SA and WA. So the BS
division also has a wider spread.
All the moves up to and including
1957 had been expansionary. The first
one of diversification came in 1958 with
the acquisition of the Perry group of
companies. This comprised four Queens-
land - incorporated subsidiaries which
operate today in Brisbane, Perth, Mel-
bourne, Auckland, Sydney and New-
castle. The division is active in the
currently buoyant building industry,
manufacturing “Whitco” window fittings
and associated hardware for wooden and
metal windows, metal windows of steel
and aluminium, aluminium shop-fronts,
tools and dies. It also does special work
to architects’ specifications, general press
work and pressure injection diecasting.
In 1959, after acquiring the four
companies in the NSW-based F. Muller
group, diversification had gone far
enough to warrant the name change from
National Radiators to the present one.
The Muller division operates in the
young heat transfer industry and, apart
from originating its own products where
possible, much production is based on
overseas design or manufactured under
licence —refrigeration and air-condition-
ing coils, fan coils and large air handling
units, commercial and domestic refrigera-
tion, forced draught coolers, air coil
cooling towers and evaporative con-
densers, holdover plates, water and air-
cooled condensers and general sheet
metal pressings.
In the same year, the widespread BS
division was brought under the parent's
wing. This division makes and distributes
oil seals and does special engineering
jobs in the industrial and automotive
fields. It also distributes ball and roller
bearings, transmission equipment and
industrial plastics.
The fifth division of today’s group was
added in 1961. This was the Eyelets
division consisting of two Victorian-
based companies. They manufacture eye-
lets for all trades, component parts for
the electrical, radio and television trades,
precision pressings and drawings, cos-
metic containers, aerosol valves and
supply blind rivets and specialised fasten-
ing systems.
Since tfre acquisition of the remaining
two divisions in 1962, no further moves
have been made- apart from minor de-
velopments within each group. First
came the RMS companies trading in
Victoria, NSW and SA. This division
is a store planner, store display specialist,
shop fitter and glass merchant. Up until
this stage it can be seen that each diversi-
fication was connected in some way with
existing activities, remote as the con-
nection may have been. Such was not
the case, however, with the addition of
the group’s seventh division, and this
may be a pointer to further diversifica-
tion moves in the future The Victorian-
based Murfett trio of companies wan
bought for shares and cash. It acts as a
publisher and distributor of greeting
cards, pictorial souvenirs, boxed station-
ery, gift wrapping papers and accessories
a far cry indeed from the original
business of making radiators.
The remarkable feature of the or-
ganisation is its excellent history of earn-
ings and shareholder benefits. This has
been achieved despite what is obviously
a very strong reliance on the boom-bust
automotive and building industries. To
a lesser extent, there is a dependence on
the air conditioning and electrical ap-
pliance fields, two others which could
hardly be called steady.
And yet the financial history is better
than most companies operating in more
stable industries. Since listing, earning
rate has not gone below the 22.4 p.c. of
1952-53. Its peak was 47.2 p.c. in 1957-
58, reflecting diversification. Even in
the latest year, after a one-for-five bonus
issue and the one-for-two bonus issue of
1958-59, it stayed high at 36.3 p.c.
Actual profit in £ s. d. has established
eleven successive records and this year
should see the twelfth. The three other
issues since listing were a one-for-three
at par in 1949-50, 53 for 100 at a 2s. 6d.
premium in 1951-52 and a one-for-four
bonus in 1955-56. With this record one
would expect dividends to be conserva-
tive. This is not the case, however. A
20 p.c. payout has been distributed for
the last seven years following a lift from
the well-established 13y p.c. in 1957-58.
The current year will see another 20 p.c.
distribution.
The reasons for this success are many
and have as much to do with managerial
attitude as anything else. This in-
tangible quality is difficult to discuss here
and one must stick to more obvious
features. One of the most obvious must
be the almost complete independence

from loan cao:tal and the interest hill
which can err p.e a company in its bad
years. Quite apart from illustrating great
internal strength in view of the expan-
sion over recent years, this also shows
that the group has not reached its
optimum as far as expansion goes.
Success must also be attributable to
the fact that expansion has not been
haphazard, no matter how it may appear
when looking back on it. Directors have
actually planned every diversification
move carefully well before the plunge
was made. Unlike many expansionists,
there has been a search for improved
financial stability as well as larger
trading operations. In fact, this com-
pany tends towards the belief that the
latter is not worth having if it does not
provide the former.
The type of business the company is
in demands a high working capital figure
especially in view of the sales growth
over recent years (1962, £9.9 million;
1963, £12.4 million; 1964, £14.3 mil-
lion). Of course a high figure requires
a greater degree of control than a low
one. Such control has been carefully
applied by the management, just as it
has to other financial aspects. The
present working capital (see table) rep-
resents more than 50 p.c. of the net
tangible assets. In the light of this, every
effort is necessary to keep it at a level
consistent with the need to service cus-
tomers and at the same time reduce the
possibility of stock obsolescence through
depreciation or otherwise.
Another reason for success has been
the increasing importance of exports to
the group. Apart from relieving the
emphasis on the home market when
times are not so good, the Government's
incentive scheme has been useful.
All these success factors plus the
steady industrial trends of the current
year, add un to another buoyant year for
National Consolidated and its share-
holders. The trend in sales looks like
going on unchanged as they were lifted
by 13.7 p.c. in the December half-year,
about the same rise scored in the first
half of 1963-64. Profits rose 4.2 p.c. and
the elimination of certain limiting factors
in the current half should bring about
an even better overall increase. This
means that the earning rate this year will
be moving back toward 40 p.c. So there
will be no trouble in maintaining the 20
p.c. dividend on the bonus-increased
capital. A steady interim has been
declared already, but the bonus shares
only rank for the final payout. Directors
said when the issue was made that divi-
dends were expected to be maintained,
The National division is continuing to
expand as the motor industry continues
on buoyant levels. Production has been
running at record levels for vehicle
radiators, car heaters and radiators for
industrial stationary units. The Aus-
tralian Railways conversion from steam
to diesel locomotives has increased the
demand for heavy duty radiators, most
of which were imported up until a few
years ago. New plant has been designed
to enable volume production of any one
model should demand necessitate it. The
NZ company has never done better now
that import restrictions on vehicles have
been relaxed, and a new factory is now

meeting the increased demand. Another
new factory in Perth has been operating
for some months now. This division
exports replacement cores and radiators
to 18 different countries.
The Perry division is riding the build-
ing boom. Even the metal window
section has produced record results
despite the severe competition in this
field. Export markets are very important,
too, and are making big contributions to
overall group results. The rapid growth
in demand for the factory at Auckland
has created a space shortage and plans
are under way for bigger premises.
Competition has been growing steadily
for the Muller division. A degree of
stabilisation in the air conditioning in-
dustry has increased the sales of coils,
however. This division sees the value of
the search for new products more than
any other. Laboratory facilities have
recently been extended. The air handling
field is a fairly new one for the division,
but has done reasonably so far.
The BS group has been suffering from
competition and subsequent cost rises
but diversification and expansion, par-
ticularly into the replacement market,
have offset this to some extent. The
division has 29 branch warehouses
throughout Australia at present. Oil
seals have been seeing more demand
from the replacement market and last
year’s extensions to the Cheltenham
(Vic.) factory have increased productive
capacity.
Cheaper methods of production are
being examined for products in the Eye-
lets division which are under heavy com-
petition. Trouble was expected last year,
mainly from overseas, but the division
still managed to lift sales and profits.
The fastener section is steadily expand-
ing and new lines being developed are
expected to boost its profitability.
The development of regional shopping
centres in NSW has brought more busi-
ness to the RMS division. A NZ sub-
sidiary is now in its third year over there
and doing very well. Glass operations
have gone on at a high level but profits
have been lower than usual. A pro-
gramme is well under way to promote a
plastic window frame for use in com-
mercial buildings. Prospects appear to
be very promising at present.
Finally, the Murfett division. It is
operating in one of the most competitive
fields of ail, yet doing particularly well
with its pictorial souvenirs and gift
wrappings. Developments are expected
on the export side of things as a first
move was made into this field last year.
The general jump shown in many of
the figures for 1962 in the table was a
result of the RMS and Murfett take-
overs made earlier in the piece. The
net effect on working capital was nil
as both current assets and current
liabilities jumped. The increase in work-
ing capital over the last two years
reflects the rapid rise in sales and the
directors’ effort serviced this trend. Fixed
assets show a steady trend after allow-
ance is made for the acquisitions which
have taken place. Investments have
remained steady, consisting mainly of a
41 p.c. interest in Duncan Industries
Ltd, held by a subsidiary. Intangibles
reflect the inclusion of goodwill for the
first time. The £450,000 represents the
difference between the value of invest-
ments in the parent accounts (at in-
dependent valuations or at cost, and the
net tangible assets at the date of
acquisition.
Deferred assets display no trend at
all. They represent moneys owing to
the subsidiaries for the sale of freeholds.
Ordinary capital shows sharp jumps
because of the recent bonus and expan-
sion but loan capital, as previously
mentioned, remains an untapped source
of finance. Preference capital has been
unchanged. The 1962 outside share-
holders’ interest was a hangover from the
Murfett acquisition, eliminated the fol-

lowing year. Reserves show an excellent
history of growth. Last year there was
a £1.9 million revaluation of the parent’s
interest in two subsidiaries but most of
this was capitalised by the bonus issue.
Depreciation, tax, profits and their
post-dividend surplus all reflect the ex-
pansion of recent years and its fruits of
mainly the last two. Dividends, as
mentioned earlier, have always been high
and well covered. One could not wish
for a better earning rate history in the
light of the jumps in ordinary capital.
Dividend yields have been barely attrac-
tive because of the capital profits element
always in the shares.
At the current price of about 275., the
ss. shares yield 3] p.c. from the dividend
after brokerage. Even Commonwealth
bonds yield better than this so the scrip
offers nothing as far as income is con-
cerned. The high price is explained by
the fact that investors can see capital
gains in the future despite the fact that
the last bonus was made less than a year
ago. If one is investing in the hope of
another bonus issue, the investment
should be a long term one. However, a
cash issue is a different matter. The
group is still expanding but has not
called on the shareholders for cash since
the 1951-52 53 for 100 issue at a 2s. 6d.
premium. Here lies the capital gains
hope of the immediate future.
Not Much From Harco Steel
Treat the shares with considerable reserve
Shareholders in Harco Steel Industries
Ltd have had little to be pleased with
in the performance of their company
since it joined the Stock Exchange lists
in 1960.
One of the brightest points was when,
in the first full year as a public com-'
pany, dividend rate was 10 p.c. despite a
flotation forecast of “not less than” 8 p.c.
■However the profit cover for this distri-
but:on was slim.
Harco Steel Fabrications Pty Ltd, the
main operating subsidiary, began opera-
tions in 1954, specialising in the making
of boilers, welded steel pipes and special
vessels.
The public company was formed in
early 1960 and floated with a placement
of 238,720 ss. shares with the public at
par plus charges. Capital on listing was
£115,000. Shortly after listing, the com-
pany took over A. M. Dulhunty Pty Ltd,
a neighboring specialist engineering
group, by an issue of 84,000 ss. shares at
a premium of 2s. 6d. Paid up capital has
remained unchanged at £136,552, all in
ordinary shares.
In September of 1960 shareholders
were offered the right to subscribe for
one ss. unsecured note for every two
shares held. At the same time the notes
carried an option to take up an ordinary
share (for every note held), exercisable
on December 31 this year. The notes
mature on October 31, 1970, and carry
8 p.c. interest but participate with shares
up to 9 p.c.
Although at the time, the company had
some liquidity problems, the influx of
more than £70,000 proved rather an em-
barrassment, and action taken has been
the source of much of the company’s
recent problems. In order to have the
funds producing income until invested in
the company, directors placed £35,000
(about half the issue) on deposit with
Gippsland Acceptance. It is now history
that Gippsland Acceptance incurred sub-
stantial losses, totalling more than
£600,000 in the past five years, so Harco
directors were probably fortunate in re-
covering about 40 p.c. of this loan.
Profit in 1960-61, the first full year of
listing, was £16,381, equal to 12 p.c. on
capital, but in the following year busi-
ness fell away. Interim dividend was
passed, and the final was reduced to 4
p.c. when profit for the year came out
at only £9413, equal to 6.9 p.c. on
capital.
Losses continued into the 1963-64
financial year, and following a consider-
able deficit in the first six months, com-
bined with the writing off of the remain-
der of the loan to Gippsland Acceptance,
the company found itself in breach of its
trust deed covering the note issue. The
assets-liabilities ratio was breached and
directors found themselves liable to re-
pay all the notes. However, by a small
margin, they were able to obtain note-
holders’ approval to waive the breach.
Profits have been earned each month
since March, 1964, at a gradually ac-
celerating rate, and an extensive manage-
ment change late last year also appears to
have had an effect.
Already the company has reported an
audited profit of £15,675 after tax for the
six months to December, with all sub-
sidiaries trading profitably and holding
substantial forward orders. The 1964 ac-
counts, made up to June 30 last, show
little effect of the reorganisation. Princi-
pal item was the refinancing of a loan
from the Commonwealth Development
Bank and unsecured loans totalling about

These twelve stocks have fallen
heavily-as Trendex said they
would. Some have bottomed. Three
will soon rise. Three will plunge
further. Which ones do you have?

Yes, that’s right. We warned about each
of the above stocks (and plenty of
others) before they sank. Like Mount
Isa at 46/11, Myer at 37/-, and T.V.
Corporation at 52/-. No hedging, either.
We didn’t say Mount Isa “looked high”.
We said sell it. And we have kept saying
that all the way down. Has Mount Isa
bottomed now, ready to go up? Or will
it fall further? We know but do you?
That’s fine about selling, but what about
buying?
The Trendex methods work well for
buying, too. Ask for our list of seventy
examples published over the last year or
so. Some of these doubled their price or
more. In the next market recovery,
which may be starting sooner than you
think, Trendex will be pointing out
plenty of stocks to buy at the right time.
In fact, it is already doing so. And
when the time comes, it will tell you
when to sell them again.
This Firm’s primary business is port-
folio management. That involves pick-

ing sound Companies. Nothing difficult
about that, though. Lots of brokers and
some other investment advisers do it
nearly as well as we do. Try it for your-
self. You have A.P.M., 8.H.P., C.S.R.,
, and the rest. Good sound com-
panies that will be going strong when
you and we are gone. Good prestige
stocks, too, they are.
There’s more to this Firm’s business
than that, though. Our clients are inter-
ested in profit rather than prestige. Take
A.P.M., for instance. If you did what our
clients do, you will have quadrupled
your money in A.P.M. in the last seven
years by buying and selling at the right
time. Alternatively, if you followed the
crowd, and bought A.P.M. when it was
popular, and sold out again when that
was popular too, you have probably cut
your money in half— or worse. What
did you actually do?
It is important to pick sound companies
for investment. But it is vital to buy
them and to sell them at the right time.

This calls for analysis of market action
not company analysis.
This Firm was the only organisation in
the country that knew anything about
such methods, a few years ago. Then we
began to publish Trendex, to bring the
techniques to the notice of investors. To-
day, lots of Trendex subscribers are
using these methods, too, with success.
Why don’t you join them?
Trendex is not a “system”, any more
than balance sheet analysis is a system.
Trendex methods are based on market
action and market psychology. Any
Trendex subscriber can learn to use
them for himself, if he is prepared to
devote reasonable time and effort to it.
He will then come to the same conclu-
sions about stocks as we do. Investing
this way isn’t quite so effortless as listen-
ing to somebody in the train, or picking
from a broker’s circular or newspaper.
But is it more successful? Oh, brother!

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A Plug for Chartists
BHP scrip is affected
the market is dull there are
generally one or two highlights
every week. Last week it was BHP and
its point and figure chart. The publica-
tion of this chart last Tuesday brought
in a rush of selling which dropped the
price Is. 6d.
Many people speak sceptically of this
form of analysis and yet it is starting
to have a significant impact on share
price movements. Often this scepticism
can be traced to the normal human fail-
ing of ridiculing anything new. Yet
these same cynics have been aghast at
how close to the mark the chartists have
been in the last few months.
The charts have their real value in
emphasising that timing of investment
is as important as the choice of invest-
ment. AWA, which was shorted last
week, serves as an example. An excel-
lent company and one no doubt doing
well because of the revival in demand
for television sets, its share price still
looks likely to sink below 265.
United Telecasters is another stock
whose share price follows an interesting
path on the chart. The shares stood just
under the 10s. mark some weeks ago
but fell very suddenly following the
opening of the television station. In.
the past, any share fall has been fol-
lowed by a partial recovery before the
share price again resumes its down-
ward trend.
With my put option, I was in the box
seat to see a repeat performance. By
buying 1000 United Telecasters at Bs.,
the minimum profit will be £62. For, if
the shares do continue to go down, I’ll
simply cover my position by exercising
the option. On the other hand, if the
share price recovers to 9s. or so, I’ll sell
on the market and not disturb the put
option.
Apart from this gratifying situation,
the other section of the portfolio be-
having well is the tin group. The world
tin price has continued to firm and has
now reached the £l5OO sterling mark.
This price looks silly against the recent
decision by the International Tin Coun-
cil to stabilise the price between a base
of £lOOO and a ceiling of £l2OO sterling.
But as the Council has no stocks to
control the market, it appears" that its
decision will have little effect on the free
world price.
In the case of Tableland Tin, another
favorable development has been the
possible formation of a joint company
with Placer Development and Bulolo
Gold to work all titles held by Tableland
outside the Smiths Qreek area. Placer
Development has shown immense skill ia
the past to pick out favorable mining
situations throughout the world. Surely
this must enhance the prospects for
Tableland Tin. Although I had sold 200
of my 400 Tableland shares at 365. 6d.
early this month, I decided that I should
buy them back. By coincidence, the
purchase was made at the same price,
making the average cost 335. 73d., dis-
regarding brokerage.
The last purchase for the week was
400 Stott & Underwood at ss. 6d. It is
one of the few shares that have crept up
in the last year against the heavy market
tide. Last year directors managed to
push profits up 50 p.c. and raise the
dividend to 53- p.c. This year has
started well with profits up for the first
half and a further increase in dividend.
But the major reason for the rise to
6s. 6d. a few months ago was the
announcement by the company that the
international firm of Dodwell & Co. Ltd,
through its Australian subsidiary, was to
take up a substantial number of shares
at Is. premium.
Now the excitement has died down
and the shares are back to ss. 6d., it
seems a good buying opportunity.
Transactions this week were:
BOUGHT
1000 United Telecasters, 8/- £412
400 Stott & Underwood, 5/6 .... £ll5
200 Tableland Tin, 36/6 £371
This brings the account swinging back
into debit to the amount of £322. This
is not necessarily an overwhelming vote
of confidence in industrial stocks as less
than half the funds are in this part of
the market.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
A Need for Organised Research
“Too much duplication, remoteness , apathy and red tape”
T|r B. R. Davidson’s book, “The
Northern Myth”, is already being
quoted by farm leaders in various parts
of temperate Australia who feel that too
much money is being spent on research
in the north.
It is not that they always share David-
son’s view that northern research is a
complete waste of time. They simply
feel that their own temperate regions are
being neglected for the more spectacular
efforts in faraway places.
As the total amount of money avail-
able for research (and extension) is
obviously limited, then a bigger slice
should be set aside for work which will
pay off. That, briefly, is the gist of the
argument.
Probably it would be more exact to
say that Davidson’s book has given these
men the peg to hang their hats on.
Over the last six months or so there
has been a quiet revision of thought on
the subject of research going on. Now
Davidson has crystallised matters and
the practical farmers always a bit
cautious about challenging the academic
establishment—are able to say: “There
you are. We have at least one scientist
saying the same things that we are.”
In almost the same week that David-
son’s book came out, the Western Vic-
torian conference of the Liberal Party—
attended mainly by primary producers—
resolved that encouragement should be
given to “long-term fundamental research
into the diversification of farming in high
rainfall areas”.
More specifically it agreed that there
was a need “for research into crops for
the high rainfall areas, in particular
yielding feed grains and green fodder'i
crops”.
The layman is probably bewildered by
these decisions and may be inclined to
explain them away as typical farmer
grumbling. After all there is the CSIRO,
and the Departments of Agriculture in
the States, and various conventions and
symposiums which seem to be going on
all the time.
There are. No one could really claim
that the farmer lacks government-spon-
sored organisations which can do the
research which the farmer needs.
But when one looks closely into the
situation one must agree that the
grumbling farmers may have a point.
There appears, on the surface anyway,
to be too much duplication, too much
remoteness, and too much plain apathy
and red tape.
For example, the CSIRO is supposed to
be unable to answer questions directly
put to it by farmers or farm organisa-
tions. But it can answer questions re-
layed by the Department of Agriculture
in the particular State concerned.
This rule is apparently not always
observed, and the unhappy result has
been that, in some States, Department
of Agriculture people and CSIRO people
accuse each other of hogging the lime-
light.
Within the departments also there is
conflict to be found.
NSW is said to be strong on pastoral
research and extension but not so good
in other areas. The Victorian depart-
ment is said to be neglecting pastoral
research in favor of horticulture.
It depends, of course, on who you
talk to.
It may well be that all these various
segments of research and extension are
merely trying to get a slice of a cake
which is too small.
All of them, when accused of failing
to do this or that, come back with the
pat reply that there just is not enough
money to do the job as they themselves
would like.
Probably the best example of research
wrangling has been the case of the wheat
research station which is being built at
Horsham in Victoria. This research
station will serve the Mallee and Wim-
mera —the major wheat-growing areas
in .Australia.
Everyone agrees that it is needed, and
everyone agrees that the efficiency of
the Australian wheat industry is due, in
no small part, to the brilliant work of
wheat researchers over the - years. But
two years of squabbling preceded the
decision to build the station at Hor-
sham. At least three other towns —some
located much more closely to the actual
wheat-growing areas —vied for the honor
of having the station. #
Doubtless the anticipated boost in
local business entered into it. One town
even offered free land and water and
was still knocked back. The Department
of Agriculture argued that the right kind
of staff could not be expected to live in
a town any smaller than Horsham.
Reading between the lines the distinct
impression is gained that as far as the
Department of Agriculture was con-
cerned the station ought to be located
right in Melbourne.
Talking to comparatively junior mem-

IFS
bers of the department, however, it was
discovered that this was not altogether
the case.
Many a young graduate would give
his eye-teeth to get a crack at doing
research in the very back-blocks but the
system of promotions in the public ser-
vice prevent them getting a chance.
The top jobs must go to older men
who, because of family responsibilities,
are not keen to leave Melbourne where
a house in a nice suburb can have a
powerful influence; particularly on the
wives.
It may be beyond the powers of any
man to resolve these problems to the
satisfaction of all.
But increasing dissatisfaction with the
performance of the departments—and
the CSIRO —is coming from farming
quarters. A few years ago everything
in the garden was lovely—or appeared
to be.
If farmers really want better research
they may, eventually, have to start think-
ing about paying for it themselves. Can
they really expect governments to go
on paying for more detailed, and more
expensive, research forever? If farmers
at least provided part of the necessary
funds, more often, then governments
may be more likely to increase the mone-
tary grants for research.
This is happening ... up to a point.
Woolgrowers, wheatgrowers, beef-raisers
and others all contribute something to-
wards research now.
But on the local front, where farmers
say the need for research is greatest, it
may be that committees will have to be
formed, drives for funds organised, and
a much greater local effort mounted
generally.
There are examples of this kind of
thing in existence also. But the majority
of farmers still seem to feel that the
government should foot the bills. If
Dr Davidson is right, then there is as
much unused, but potentially arable,
land in the southern temperate parts of
Australia as in the far north (about 35
million acres in each case). Ideally, both
the south and north should be developed.
Southern farmers, if they dipped into
their own pockets, and encouraged pri-
vate firms and well-wishers to do the
same, would find some advantages coming
their way.
In the first place the value of their
own properties would be increased and,
secondly, they would have a greater con-
trol over the type of research being con-
ducted.
This Is in no way a recommendation.
It is an observation, purely and simply.
Enough farmers are talking this way for
this writer to feel confident that a new
era of “self-help” in the research field
is about to dawn in Australia.
Another Beef about Beef
States making it harder to sell our quota
QJir Robert Menzies has enraged the
bishops, and others, with his state-
ments in support of US policy in Viet-
nam.
Leaving all that to the foreign affairs
experts this writer cannot help wonder-
ing if President Johnson—a “son of the
soil” —values Australian moral support
enough to do something about the
worsening Australian-American mone-
tary and trading relationship.
It will be remembered that Australia,
and New Zealand, voluntarily cut exports
of beef to the US last year when the
American cattle States put the pressure
on Johnson before and during the Presi-
dential Election.
The US brought in regulations which
prohibit the import of beef beyond a
certain quota —about 934 million lbs.
But as we were such decent fellows
there appeared little likelihood of the
prohibition being enforced.
US Secretary of Agriculture Orville
Freeman has estimated that the total
beef imports this year (mainly from Aus-
tralia and New Zealand) will amount *o
only 714 million lbs.
Thus the cattle States should be
satisfied and President Johnson can avoid
implementing legislation which can only
be described as completely contradictory
to America’s avowed intention of freeing
world trade.
But are the cattle States satisfied with
the legislation?
Obviously they are not.
They are not even satisfied with the
voluntary cut-back. Individual States in
the United States are putting through
legislation which will discriminate against
imported meats. This legislation revolves
around health, packaging and labelling
laws.
Provided we stick to sending less
meat to the US than the quota arrange-
ment allows, then that meat must get into
the US.
But the State laws will prevent it being
sold across the counters to the public.
Neither the Australian Government
nor the American Government actually
sells or buys the meat. It is handled at
both ends by private firms.
If the American importing firms are
unable to find distributors who can sell
within the State laws to the public, then
obviously they are going to cease import-
ing.
The States so far which have con-
cocted (that seems a fair word to use in
this case) discriminatory laws against
Australian meat are Texas (the Presi-
dent’s own State), Arkansas, Idaho,
North Dakota, Utah, Tennessee and
Oregon.
Others are said to be following suit.
The big outlets (New York, Chicago,
Los Angeles) may still be able to sell
Australian and other .imported meats.
But there is a subtle twist here.
The cattle States are pushing for an
addition to the quota legislation which
will make it necessary for foreign meat
to be stamped “foreign”. It is such a
simple little thing and it sounds alto-
gether reasonable. But food processors
in the US say that the word “foreign”,
stamped on meat, would be the kiss of
death.
One can only assume that the Ameri-
cans who ate 170 million dollars’ worth
of Australian meat last year did so
oblivious to its origin.
Americans already have an in-built
dislike for “foreign” food apparently;
and this dislike could be easily enough

Could we counter it?
It’s doubtful.
It’s doubtful, also, that President
Johnson will be able to do anything
about the State laws going through. It’s
doubtful if, to the President, the whole
thing is important enough anyway.
This writer is prepared to bet that
Orville Freeman’s estimate of 714 mil-
lion lbs this year (over 1000 million last
year) will not be realised.
We will still sell some meat to the
US but it really does look as if the

Considering the Vietnam situation,
the really ironic thing is that Red China

ments of Australian wheat without

How to make it a Pleasure Trip, too!
Plan to combine business with pleasure
when you make that business expedition to
Britain. Begin by enjoying the relaxations
of a sea trip there and back. And linger
while you're there—long enough to explore
such places as Shakespeareland or the Lake
District or Scotland, Wales or Northern
Ireland.
Plan to watch a little cricket at lords
or tennis at Wimbledon. Plan to play your
way around the Old Course at St. Andrews
—in the land where golf was born! Or plan
simply especially if your wife is travel-
ling with you to wander for a free-
swinging day or two in the green and
pleasant countryside of England with its
old world villages, its friendly inns (you
can bed and breakfast in one for around
35/-), its leafy lanes.
And remember, Britain makes a splendid
base from which to transact business in
Europe. It’s conveniently close to every
European capital.
To find out more about Britain about
where to stay there, what to see and do
there, how to get around and how little il
all can cost get in touch with your travel

Keystone Press Agency photograph of the burning of the books. Berlin. May 10, 1 933.
These are the books that Hitler burned
These are the books that had to burn.
For within the great books are volumes
that hold the ideas and thinking that chal-
lenge the fettered mind; the thoughts and
theories that have built democracies,
withered tyrants, opened new worlds,
riddled superstition with everlasting truth.
Contained within the great books of
the western world is power enough to
frighten any dictator; wisdom and
strength enough to make any thinking
person sounder in judgment, bolder in
thought.
i
THE SYNTOPICON
These great
volumes contain a
great conversation
of ideas that have
echoed from mind

writing and thinking
of civilization’s
great men. A con-

government, literature, philosophy,
religion—all the great humanities.
Included with this magnificent set is the
revolutionary two-volume syntopicon
which makes these writings and ideas
easily available to anyone who seeks the
truth. The syntopicon is a unique idea-
index that allows the reader to consult any
author of the great books of the
western world on a given idea as easily
as looking up words in a dictionary. With
the syntopicon as your guide, the great
books can be your key to new worlds of
confidence, new avenues of thought.
