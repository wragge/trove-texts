IN 1340 WOOLLEN WEALTH BUILT THE VASTNESS OF PENSHURST PLACE
FOR almost five centuries Pcnshurst Place, one of the great ancestral homes
of Endand has stood on the north bank of the River Medway, six miles
PromTudSae Wells in Kent. The irregular outline of the ancient and
hAi so with its mellow red brick towers, chimneys and gables, rises
SRfltiTxtensWe jSteTSd SUs. During the Second World War this
peaceful scene”was shattered by flying bombs from the Continent, three of
which landed nearby, but fortunately the house a
Pcnshurst Place, the home of Lord De L Isle and Dudley, nas neen *
country home since 1340, when the original building was the piopeity of Sir
John de Pu tene? a wealthy wool merchant who four times became mayo.
if TmdJn PHmrd VI save the house to his Chamberlain and Chet
uncle, the Earl of Leicester, Pcnshurst passed to Philips brother, Sir kodbi
Sidney Thereafter the house passed from father to son except for two
.Generations in the eighteenth century when it passed through the female line.
Of the many impressive State Rooms at Pcnshurst Place the most
outstanding is the great Baron’s Hall, which has a high, timbered ceiling
and which contains the original central hearth Irom which the smoke once
lose to find its way out through a vent in the roof. A hioad stairway leads
upwards to the Withdrawing Room, which contains many hne paintings and
also a peephole which enabled the ladies, after they had withdrawn, to observe
the progress of their lords in (he Baron’s Hall below.
Many unique exhibits arc shown in the Armoury, one of which is a
sword which figured in many ceremonial occasions during the reign of Queen
Elizabeth On the panelled walls of the Long Gallery are hung many family
portraits and over the doorway to the Tapestry Room is one of a little girl,
PriS' Etoteh, daughter of King Charles I who, alter her father's
execution, was sent for a time to live at Pcnshurst Place.

HITLER'S INTERPRETER .
For a Nazi who is able to call his
. autobiography by the sensational title
of Hitler’s Interpreter (Heinemann) with
the subtitle of “The Secret History of
German Diplomacy, 1935-1945,” Dr.
Paul Schmidt presents to the world a
singularly innocent face ; painting him-
self as a mild, jolly little man, given to
consoling himself with a nip of what he
or his translator persists in calling “the
right stuff,” always hoping for peace and
full of goodwill towards everyone.
A couple of slight lapses give the im-
•pression that there was more in him than
meets the eye. When he is listening to
Hitler talking about his “unshakable
will” at a banquet to Mussolini he seems
to reflect a little sadly that his master’s
unshakable will on this occasion meant
that the South Tyrol Germans were to be
“now finally a part of Italy,” a theme
of regret to which he returns on another
occasion when he is passing through
Italy by train. And when he is recording
his sadness at the onslaught on Poland
a note strangely resembling jubilation
appears to creep in:
One of my duties was to make a daily
report on the military situation....! do
not know what Ribbentrop got out of it —
my colleagues seemed to be fairly im-
pressed as I scooped in whole areas [on
the map] with the flat of my hand, or
represented an encirclement with curved
hand. For several days 1 was called noth-
ing but Napoleon.
As in Dr. Schacht's autobiography
these little slips convey the impression
that the author was possibly a mor
ardent pacifist after the war than before
it. Dr. Schmidt may well have preferrec
a little war he could win to a large anc
doubtful struggle with England and
France, but the only member of the Nazi-
Fascist gang who seems to have been
seriously disturbed when the big war
broke out —and he was flabbergasted—
was C ount Ciano. An unexpected com-
panion in distress, if. we. are to believe
Dr. Schmidt, was Hitler himself; at leas:
it seems possible that Hitler was misled
by Ribbentrop into thinking that Englano
would not honor her guarantee to
Poland, though of course both he anc
Mussolini knew that war with the great
democracies must come sooner or later:
1 stopped at some distance from Hitler’s
desk and then slowly translated the British
Government's ultimatum. When 1 finished
(here was complete silence. Hitler sat im-
mobile, gazing before him. He was not at
a loss, as was afterwards slated, nor did
he rage, as others allege. He sat completely
silent and unmoving. After an interval
which seemed an age, he turned to Ribben-
trop, who had remained standing by the
window. “What now?” asked Hitler with
a savage look, as though implying that his
Foreign Minister had misled him about
England's probable reaction. Ribbentrop
answered quietly, “I assume that the French
will hand in a similar ultimatum within
the hour.”
Dr. Schmidt, one observes, did not
taint with horror on thus coming face
to face with the destroyers of European
civilisation, as Hacha fainted in
Goring’s company when the Nazis were
cutting up Czechoslovakia and as the
Rumanian Foreign Minister fainted (in
a scene Dr. Schmidt describes) when he
saw the new boundaries Ribbentrop had
fixed for his country ; nor did the inter-
preter protest to Hitler or, on any happy
inspiration, throw a bomb. But of course
it would have cost him his life if he had
—probably a faint would have been
enough for that—and, if you read parts
of it with a grain of salt, his. slightly
overemphasised innocence really affects
the quality of his book very little.
The quality is mixed. Dr. Schmidt is
certainly not, as the publishers hopefully
claim, another Ciano, whose auto-
biography remains by far the most
dramatic personal document of its kind
that has come out of the war; on the
other hand he is not as dull as Dr.
Schacht, nor as journalistic as Goebbels,
who merely dictated his journal, like a
series of public speeches, to a typist. Too
often Dr. Schmidt, instead of reporting in
precise detail what actur j was
done, talks in generalities:'—
»,, The .. last me eting between Hitler and
Mussolini before the collapse of Fascist
1 taly was a memorable 0ne.... Mussolini
was taken severely to task by Hitler before
the assembled Italian Generals. This meet-
ing was one of the most depressing in
which I have ever taken part... .Musso-
lini himself was so overwrought that on his
return to Rome he asked urgently for my
report: we were told that he had not been
able to follow the conversations.
This bare outline of a scene that must
have been so packed with rage and
terror is extremely disappointing. But
then, just as often as he is vague. Dr.
Schmidt is, at other times, precise; and
nothing could be more vivid, or more
typically German and English, than his
account of the final quarrel, on the eve
of the invasion of Poland, between
Ribbentrop and Henderson:
The British Government, Henderson said,
possessed information to the effect that
Germans were committing acts of sabotage
in Poland.
“That’s a damned lie of the Polish Gov-
ernment’s!” Ribbentrop shouted in a fury,
u can onl y y° u > Herr Henderson, that
the position is damned serious!”
Now the British Ambassador also lost
his temper. Lifting a finger in admonition,
he shouted: “You have just said ‘damned.’
That is no word for a statesman to use in
so grave a situation.”
And of course, whether it is in gener-
alities or direct reporting, the whole book
teems with invaluable historical informa-
tion. Some of the outstanding scenes are
the visits of Lloyd George and Lans-
bury to Berchtesgaden in which, though
Lloyd George may have had reservations
to his enthusiasm, Lansbury in his
idealism seems a hopelessly silly old
gentleman; the visit of the Duke of
Windsor to Goring, who showed him his
toy trains and his little toy aeroplanes
that dropped tiny bombs ; Chamberlain’s
threat to return home from the Berch-
tesgaden meeting, just before Munich,
which momentarily brought Hitler to his
senses; Hitler and Mussolini arranging
their absurd triumphal processions in
trains that ran side by side on parallel
tracks, the German train drawing ahead
before, each stopping-place so that Hitler
could dart out and enthusiastically greet
his Italian buddy again on the red
carpet; Franco carefully playing his
double game of agreeing to go to war
for Germany but only on impossible con-
ditions, such as insisting on capturing
Gibraltar with Spanish troops; King
Leopold sitting silent before Hitler “like
a boy longing for school to be over”;
Hitler telling Mussolini about the attempt
on his life, at which “Mussolini’s
naturally prominent eyes seemed to start
out of his head with horror.”
Finally, it is pleasing to learn from
Dr. Schmidt that Goebbels committed
suicide in a state of extreme rage, having
told his faithful colleagues, “Now you
see what you get for having worked for
us. Now your number’s up, too, and
the whole German people are getting
what they deserved”; this very interest-
ing point, as to his exact state of mind
at the end, was, naturally, not made
precisely clear in The Goebbels Diaries.
Fuseli's Drawings .
Just as the surrealists today hope to
make their pictures “disquieting” so did
the Swiss-bom Fuseli, Blake’s contempo-
rary and friend, try to represent “the
moment of horror”: therefore there is a
renewed interest in the ferocious little
Swiss, as a result of which we have The
Drawings of Henry Fuseli by Nicolas
Powell (Faber).
Sacheverell Sitwell in his Narrative
Pictures was deeply impressed by Fuseli’s
power to horrify:
Two of these drawings, in particular, may
claim our attention. The first is a study of
a female figure standing by a mantelpiece.
She is dressed in the long, clinging garments
that were the fashion at the time, but is
transported into the nightmare world by
the curious expression of her features, which
have that sort of intensified or spectral
horror which is unaccountable, which tran-
scends reality, and which is only encoun-
tered in the mazes of the subconscious
world. These are the true realms of Pluto,
more realistically horrible than the diableries
of the medieval imagination.
In the reproductions in Nicolas Powell’s
book it is difficult to find Fuseli quite as
alarming as this. One sees a giantess
leaning in her long flowing robes against
the mantelpiece; two normal-sized
women, dwarfed by comparison, crouched
at her feet; and the general effect, with
what appears at first glance to be a
simpering smile on the face of the giant,
is simply of oddity. But then, when you
look closely, there is, indeed, something
mask-like, macabre, deathly in her ex-
pression ; an impression, perhaps, drawn
from the spiritual reality of Lady Mac-
beth, who at all times haunted Fuseli’s
imagination.
Some other drawings—the wild sensu-
ality of Juliet kissing Romeo goodbye as
“Head of a Woman in a Cap”—also speak
clearly of Fuseli’s power. But if Mr.
Powell’s book was really going to alarm
us it would need to reproduce, as well as
the drawings, such paintings in oils as
“The Nightmare” ; which, a little hack-
neyed though it may be, has more truly
disquieting power in that horse’s head
blazing through the curtains of the night
over the body of the sleeping girl than
there is in any modern surrealist painting
this reviewer has seen'; more daemonic
intensity, indeed, than most of the pro-
ducts of Blake’s exuberant fancy, which
so often, as far as their emotional effect
goes, are merely curious.
But if the general effect of the draw-
ings is rather slight—and Mr. Powell tells
us that many of Fuseli’s oils, due to his
careless craftsmanship, are cracking or
fading—this is still a very interesting
book. Most of the drawings have never
been reproduced before ; Mr. Powell pro-
vides an expert commentary on them ;
and he has, too, an admirably compact
and entertaining monograph of Fuseli’s
life . . . and Fuseli, who boasted that he
could swear in eight languages; who
described himself as “principal hobgoblin
painter to the devil” ; who once cried out
in exasperation, “Damn Nature! —she
always puts me out! ” ; and who gave this
memorable account of his methods of
work, “First I sits myself down. Then
I works myself up. Then I throws in my
darks. Then I puffs out my lights”—is
a rare gift for any biographer.
One does not like to conclude this
review with a purely Australian com-
plaint ; but Mr. Powell is surely unjust
when he describes Thomas Griffiths
Wainewright who, along with Theodor
von Holst, the illustrator of Frankenstein,
Lawrence, Wilkie, Haydon, Landseer and
that delightful painter of the nude, Etty,
was a pupil of Fuseli’s, as “the forger.”
It is true that Wainewright did forge;
but he has higher claims to fame than
that and should, in all courtesy, be
described as “the poisoner.”
Travellers in Queensland .
saying that People We Met by
A. C. C. Lock (Willmet, Townsville) i
indigestible, the reviewer insists that he
is speaking only for himself. The many
thousands of readers who find solace in
the works of Mr. Frank Ciune will fine
here what they found there. An indc
fatigable Holmes, Mr, Lock and his
Watson, Mr. Hobbs, travel all ove
Queensland ; the Barrier Reef, the coast
and inland to the Gulf country; they
question suspects and gain innumerable
clues ; but as there is no mystery, they
achieve no solution.
Nobody is overlooked; the man who
sits opposite them in a train, or shares
a table with them at an hotel, or meets
them in the street, has his name taken
and is asked to say something for pub-
lication : whatever he says is recorder
with his name and where he comes from
and some flattering reference to his
appearance—the only exceptions seem to
be drink-waiters, who are mentioned by
their Christian names, and a commercial
traveller playing crap in a Rockhampton
pub, his pockets bulging with money
and a barber, “much given to conversa-
tion, like most barbers”:
“The trouble these days,” he commented,
“is that too many people say too much
about things they know nothing about.”
On the other hand, if you knew the
country, or had your name in the book,
Mr. Lock’s opinions and observations of
the scenery, etc., might be of enthralling
interest. His travels took him to Towns-
ville, Rockhampton, Cairns, Chillagoe,
Cloncurry, Mount Isa, Forsayth, Croy-
don, Einasleigh, Mareeba and literally
hundreds of other towns, interviewing and
describing as he went.
Near Euri Creek, J. Arrarata told him
of the days when men’s trousers were lop-
sided after they had been paid in
sovereigns and half-sovereigns ; Frederick
Strohfledt, of Rolleston, told them of
1874, when a fever cleaned Burketown
right out and all who hadn’t died there
went to liye at Normantown; Frank
Alston, of Brisbane, told him in
Charters Towers that Neville Sellwood
was the outstanding boy at Townsville
when he was stationed there during the
war, and rode a lot of winners for him
[Alston]; Dick Fair, dining by candle-
light in a blackout in Queen’s Hotel,
Townsville, said that Albury had im-
pressed him most of all Australian towns
—he was up there with Claud Holland
and Jean Bates conducting the amateur
hour which put Rosemary Kiernan on
the air.
Sir Thomas Blarney, ashore at Towns-
ville with a party cruising on the
Northern Star, recalled Armentibres, Bac
-- - ix du Bac, praised
General Jack Stevens, and General
Morshead, whose defence of Tobruk had
changed history” ; A. W. Fadden “spent
one half of the meal eating, the other
half shaking hands with visitors from the
north-west”; post-office engineer Jim
Hickey knew “more people even than' Z
Federal Treasurer”; a gentleman of
Boulia, with “Indian blood in his veins,
possibly aborigine and European as
well,” had often seen hypnotised frogs
jumping into snakes’ mouths; station-
master W. O’Brien, of Yungaburra, had
turned the station into a museum of
snakes, sample woods and metals ; some-
one, whose name escaped (somehow) Mr.
Lock, spoke of an old German who,
when annoyed with his wife, lowered her
in a bucket in a deep well and left her
there until she promised to be good . . ,
Cattle, sheep, mining, curtain-figs,
giant clams, waterlilies, drilling for oil,
chutney ingredients for Sydney, life on
Dunk Island are all part of this huge,
unorganised survey; of. the more than
70 pictures, that of the opencut at Blair
Athol is most impressive. Indeed, the
material in it should make it a most
fascinating book: but Mr. Lock could
never entitle his labors On Our Selection,
for he seems incapable of selecting. His
freshest interviews and descriptions rub
shoulders with the weariest of small
talk:
A remittance man said to me one day,
“What university did you attend?” I
replied, “The university of the world.”
He cannot leave a personality or a
scene without some commonplace philoso-
phising about it; meeting an Irishwoman
inspires him to a recitation of “Danny
Boy,” and:
The impression was strong on us that so
long as there was a Londonderry Air so
long will there be a Tipperary, from whose
stock Mrs. Shannon was bred; a light
burning before the Sacred Heart in all the
homes of Tara Hall, and visions of heaven
among the lakes of Killarney.
And one can only hope that the de-
scriptions of some of the people met
do not cause them the same discomfort
that they caused one reader Never-
theless, one should say to many
thousands of readers: Here is a hook
you will enjoy.
Magi c.
The importance for one reader of
Magic As a Hobby, by Bruce Elliott
(Faber), is that it shows how the conjurer
cut the rope and joined it together again
at The Bulletin picnic this year or, at
least, one way in which he might have
done it, credited to an American magic
dealer called Grant. There are a great
number of “faked” rope tricks, says Mr.
Elliott, but it must be agreed that this is
an extraordinarily simple and subtle one.
One notices, with it, Joe Keene’s slip-
knot, in which he ties a knot in a rope,
and then runs the knot up and down the
rope, eventually throwing it to the audi-
ence ; and Joe Barnett’s skullduggery, by
which a spectator is allowed to cut a
length of string, after which a ring, ex-
pected to drop off one of the halves, is
seen to run the full length of the restored
string—a very ingenious trifle.
There are many card-tricks; notes on
Dr. Franklin V. Taylor’s Peek Pack,
which “has in the short space of three
years become a standard prop” ; diagrams
of how to conceal handkerchiefs and
pound-notes in the elbow-creases of one’s
sleeves, tricks with slates; strange dis-
coveries under pocket-handkerchiefs.
Under the heading “Elliott’s Enigmas”
—which have nothing to do with
The Waste Land —there is a chapter
on the author’s own inventions (he
is editor of “The Phoenix,” an
American magazine for professional
magicians), which begins with a snake
that comes out of a basket and picks the
card the spectator is thinking of, a spake
half cottonwool, half balloon, with an
Alka Seltzer tablet in the tip of its nose.
"Coast to Coast."

PARLIAMENT AND PERIL.
Federal Parliament has settled down to
work —if such it can be described —the
Government faced with almost unsolvable
problems of finance and tactics, compli-
cated by the nature of its own party and
parliamentary organisation. Only two
months after a victory which deeded it
full control of Parliament for the first
time it appears to be both on the defence
and without constructive drive. In this
position it is a subject for sympathy, but
the disinterested sympathy of public
opinion has rarely been an ingredient in
the success of Governments.
At present the aggressiveness of party
politics seems to be a monopoly of the
“Labor” party, or rather of a section of
that party, since the fight comes not from
the leaders, who have not yet found their
feet, but from a bloc headed by Messrs.
E. J. Ward and Clyde Cameron of South
Australia, who have apparently learned
their political methods from the Com-
munist party and are applying the tech-
nique which Communist minorities apply
to secure control of the policies of asso-
cations and public gatherings.
Not a few of the Government’s diffi-
culties are due to the complications intro-
duced by the multiplication of Ministers
and the growth of the parties. It is obvi-
ous that the more Ministers there are
the more difference of opinion there must
be, the more discussion before important
decisions are made and the greater the
area of Ministerial surface exposed to
the impact of party opinion. And com-
plication is worse complicated by the
divergences of view which develop in all
large parties, and which have a tendency
to express themselves through caves, not
to mention the innate differences in basic
policy which have to be compromised
between Liberal party and Country party
—such as that which makes it almost im-
possible for the Government to bring to
open discussion the question of revalua-
tion of the pound.
Added to the handicaps based on these
facts a new one has arisen directly out
of them: in the multiplication of Depart-
ments and Federal functions, and the
equal multiplication of discussion as a
preliminary to decisions, it has become
no longer possible for a Prime Minister
to be both a normal parliamentary leader
in the House and the de facto manager
of the executive. “Labor” has endeavored
to maintain the dual role in Australia
(though abandoned in Britain), with the
result that it has killed its last two leaders.
Mr. Menzies also has abandoned it. He
spends little time on the Treasury
Benches during routine sittings, and Mr.
Harrison has been accorded official recog-
nition as leader of the House, a position
hitherto unknown to procedure at Can-
berra. The trend is unfortunate. It repre-
sents a sapping away of basic parlia-
mentary theory which has always made
the Prime Minister personally responsible
for the acts of his Ministry to the point
that the withdrawal of Parliament’s con-
fidence in him automatically removes the
rest of his Ministers from office.
It is doubly unfortunate at the moment,
since “Labor” —and not only “Labor” —
has built about the fact a rumor that Mr.
Menzies is discreetly and gradually with-
drawing himself from the political sphere ;
that he proposes to extend the term of
Mr. McKell as Governor-General to
cover the King’s visit and the residuary
portion of Sir John Latham’s long leave ;
that upon retirement Sir John will be
offered the Governor-Generalship, while
Mr. Menzies will assume the Chief
Justiceship of the High Court.
The importance of this rumor does not
depend upon its truth or falsity. The fact
that it is widely entertained, and not alone
by “Labor,” helps considerably to give
at least some members and a section of
the Press gallery a feeling that the leader-
ship of the Government parties is as
insecure and unstable as that of the
“Labor” party.
“Labor” is naturally eager, in its own
distressed state, to propagate this idea and
promote discussion of probable successors
to Mr. Menzies, of whom the prospective
supply is certainly not inspiring. At the
same time “Labor” is not so happy as
might be expected about the supposed
extension of Mr. McKell’s term of office,
since a large section apparently considers
that their late colleague let them down by
granting a double-dissolution. This was
reflected last week in the failure of caucus
to agree to take action in protest against
the routine over-formal behavior of the
Speaker towards his Excellency at the
presentation of the Address-in-Reply.
Six months ago a tempest would have
burst about the Speaker’s head.
If the explosive condition of the
“Labor” party is a cause for rejoicing
for the Government, outside the achieve-
ment of a Senate majority it is the only
one. It matters little that the Govern-
ment’s troubles are due to years of reck-
less financing, riotous social experiment
and carefree, extravagant administration
by “Labor” Governments. Unless the
Government can sheet home cleanly to
the “Labor” party the real responsibility
for the rising cost of living and the rising
incidence of loafing and national ruin in
a time of boom export earnings it must
inevitably be punished for what is hap-
pening and blamed for its actions —of the
efficacy of which a lot of its own sup-
porters have doubts.
The “Labor” party is a body whose
platform, revised at the 1948 Triennial
Conference, calls for a 40-hour week
universally, with a progressive reduction
to 30 hours —taking no account of the
rising number of public holidays, a fort-
night’s annual holiday for every worker
at employers’ expense, old-age pensions
without means test at basic-wage level,
free medicine, free medical attention and
a host of other handouts and huge ex-
pansiveness of social services, with con-
sequent expansions of the public service.
It initiated during its nine years of office
a policy which makes it inevitable that
the productive industries from which the
national real income is derived are
stripped to the bone of labor, and that
what labor does remain to them would
be better described as loaf. That policy,
which any non-Labor Government will
find it difficult to liquidate, must
result in continually ballooning govern-
ment expenditure and the vicious neces-
sity of passing on costs.
The Government is, in fact, faced with
about as unpleasant a three months to
come as any Government fresh from a
signal victory at the polls has ever faced.
Its budget, if it is to be honest, will have
to be ruthlessly unpopular. It will have
to increase taxation. It will have to draw
young men from their idle pleasures and
their soft jobs to do hard defence train-
ing. It will have to submit to the coun-
try a referendum on Communism, a vital
subject, but one which has been worn
threadbare by discussion and upon which
it must face “Labor’s” opposition. It
will have to resist “Labor’s” delusive but
alluring proposal for a prices referendum
at the same time. It will have to take
stern measures in the industrial field to
keep ships and transport running, against
the bitter resistance of a trade-union
movement openly determined to prevent
any Government which it does not con-
trol from continuing to exist, whatever
the vote of the electors.
To mend the present drift, the rising
costs, the inflation which will be stimu-
lated if war should come, there is only
one sure remedy—vastly increased pro-
duction attained by universal effort
and hard work. This can be obtained
only by the united co-operation of par-
liamentary parties and through some
temporary sacrifices by sections of the
voters.
If the Government cannot get this co-
operative consent to these sacrifices chaos
lies ahead. But the task of trying to
persuade a country on a large spending
and loafing jag of this fact must be
frightening.
Japan's Revival.
Many Australians may view the proposed
American treaty for Japan with some
aversion. But this feeling is nothing
to the dismay of Moscow and Peking at
the prospect of Japan’s restoration to
international activity.
That is what prompted Malik’s carefully-
prepared statement at U.N.O. about
readiness to make peace in Korea. In
the struggle for world dominion which
Moscow calls “chess without vodka,”
America has made a key-move on the
board; and the Korean gambit which a
year ago seemed astute enough to the
Kremlin, has resulted in even worse dis-
comfiture than the 1948 Berlin blockade.
The return of Japan into the balances of
power-politics might have been much
slower and less influential but for the
challenge thrown down in Korea by the
ancient antagonist of Japan and
modern foe of all the democracies. It has
rebounded against the Communists’
planned aggression both militarily and
economically.
Taking the miltary position first, it is
true to say that in the world-wide “cold
war” waged by Russia America had one
position of advantage from the start —
her undisputed control (by consent of
her Western allies) in Japan. In Western
Europe the American rebuilders of a
defence front against the Soviet threats
have had to work upon a medley of
peoples infected with fear of post-war
Russia, and riddled with Communist
agents working for Russia’s hour to
strike. But in Japan the Americans could
construct a defensive front on the basis
of a single nation predisposed to
distrust every Russian action. Even
so, Japan might not have consented to be
a pawn in the game, and America might
have failed to carry her allies with her
in her Japanese policy, had not Russia
pursued her successful diplomatic chal-
lenge of America from China and Man-
churia into Korea and Formosa.
As for the prospective Japanese treaty’s
effect on the Soviet, let every student of
the deadly game proceeding before his
eyes ask himself how the Korean war,
already recoiling upon its authors, would
look to them in a few months’ time, with
Japan free and sovereign again as
America’s treaty partner.
In any case, as the situation has already
convinced our Government, we are
impotent to turn back the clock.
We are not going to induce the United
States to withdraw a key-move on the
board, even if that were possible, and
the offer of a Pacific Pact for mutual
assistance in emergency must require our
support for the treaty as well as perform-
ance of our part in the special agreement
corollary to it.
Primarily the economic clauses of the
Japanese treaty may affect us and other
trading countries more keenly. During
the past 10 years or more the elimina-
tion from the world’s markets of German
and Japanese industry and shipping ser-
vices, along with the shutting-off of
central and eastern European trade first
by Hitler’s war and then by Stalin, are
manifestly prime causes in the universal
shortage of goods and services. Inflation
everywhere and high prices are a result.
Russia’s Communist agents in every
democracy are exploiting the local effects
of these discontents and aggravating the
shortages. Their agitation of political
strikes in every democratic country is part
and parcel of the Soviet’s campaign to
stifle international trade upon which the
democracies will stand or fall.
The 10-years’ absence of Japan and
Germany from international trading
competition have created in all the
English-speaking countries, and not least
in Australia, a vested interest in high
prices of goods, labor and transport ser-
vices. The other name for that vested
interest is inflation, direct result of in-
sufficient supplies and services to meet
demand.
It is to be suspected that much of the
fear expressed in Britain and in this
country over the restoration of the two
chief ex-enemy Powers are founded on
resentment against the prospective return
of their competition in world-trade. They
will have every incentive to throw them-
selves into the business of producing
everything the world sorely needs, and
discriminatory regulations with which
Australia, for one, may attempt to protect
a 40-hour week, go-slow and high costs
will react upon ourselves.
Let us look at the shipping picture
today on the Australian coast. Tasmania
has been without steamer connection with
the mainland. No passenger ship is run-
ning between Australia and New Zealand
or between either Dominion and North
America, High costs and strikes have
crippled these services. Shareholders in
most Australian shipping companies
have forgotten what it is to receive
a dividend, and if these enter-
prises follow the course of N.S.W.
coastal freighters they will soon be fold-
ing up entirely. The Australian coast is
rated by overseas shipmasters as the worst
in the world for services in ports, where
every vessel entering seems to be regarded
as an object of union hostility. Our
people’s complacent acceptance of these
conditions, as though in ignorance that
anything better were ever known, should
receive a rude shock in the day when per-
haps the Sydney Maru appears on the
apple-run to Hobart, or the Pacific Maru
reopens for the British Empire the all-red
route between Sydney and Vancouver.
Meanwhile the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment has engaged the services of the
late British port-controller in Singapore
and Penang to investigate Australian sea-
ports and tell it the cause of the hold-
up disease on the local waterside. This
is, of course, part of the policy of being
patient with aggressively militant unions.
The gesture is not new. Over several
years past coalmining experts from Britain
and America have been brought here to
report to Governments on how to im-
prove our coal output; they have all said
the same thing, learned that the previous
advisers had said it before them and with-
out the slightest result, and gone away
marvelling that a people singularly
blessed by Nature should seem to enjoy
making its daily life as awkward for
itself as possible.
If the Japanese treaty can wake us
out of this sloth it could be welcomed
even from the insular aspect.
Commissionaires.
The annual meeting of the N.S.W. branch
showed a flourishing state in the Corps of
Commissionaires —the home unit founded
by Captain (Sir) Edward Walter, son of
the “great” John Walter of the “Times,”
to provide for discharged soldiers and
sailors of the Crimean War and Indian
Mutiny.
Founded here in 1939 by Mr. Edward
Hirst, who is to retire shortly from the
joint managing-directorship of British
General Electric, the Corps’ blue uniforms
and long rows of ribbons are already
thoroughly familiar in public buildings
in Sydney and Melbourne. In London
and the bigger cities of England their
employment is general. No great building
which considers itself smart and stylish is
without a detachment of official and
uniformed commissionaires if one can be
obtained.
The writer well remembers one who
used to do duty at the White Hart Inn,
opposite Windsor Castle, and who
was about the most saluted man in
Windsor, the King not excepted, since he
wore a piece of crimson ribbon with a
little bronze cross on it which drew the
hand of every officer, royal or otherwise,
to his cap in proper ceremonial homage
to a V.C. And everybody in The Bul-
letin office, 10,000 miles or so from
Windsor, remembers another proud
member of the Corps they used to see
across the street, because he also wore
one of the rarest war ribbons in the world
—that of Younghusband’s expedition to
Tibet.
The Corps is a genuine military body,
to organise for the employment in
uniform of former members of the ser-
vices who have seen active service or who
have served in the permanent forces. It
is disciplined, and it is under control of
a commandant-secretary, who invariably
is an officer of colonel’s rank or more —
Brigadier R. M. Thompson, D. 5.0., M.C.,
formerly 8.G.5., Eastern Command, who
was Field-Marshal Montgomery’s con-
ducting officer when he was in Australia,
has recently succeeded Major-General
Hardie.
Commissionaires are carefully selected
and managed in a way which guarantees
their character and trustworthiness, and
they are available for a wide range of
services—as inquiry clerks, hall porters,
receptionists, postal clerks, guides, turn-
stile attendants, watchmen, messengers,
club stewards and porters and bank
guards. When there are enough of them
they can be had for temporary duties on
racecourses, at agricultural shows, sales,
weddings or for any other function or
duty which a man in uniform can carry
out —even to looking after a home or
flat during the absence of the owner.
A fund for the Corps’ maintenance has
had substantial assistance in N.S.W.
from the business community and from
individuals, among whom a generous
donor has been Mr. E. J. Hallstrom. Its
revenues are used solely for the benefit
of the Corps and of its commissionaires,
and it has the full support of military
and returned-soldier organisations. The
late Field-Marshal Sir Thomas Blarney
was patron in Victoria, Sir Leslie Mors-
head is vice-patron in N S. Wales, and
Major-General H. W. Lloyd and Mr.
Wm. Yeo, State president of the
R.S.L., are on the board of governors
in N. S. Wales.
The movement is one which could be
extended with advantage to other States
and to smaller cities and towns, especially
since it provides for a range of occupa-
tions which meets the needs both of com-
paratively young men and of men who
have reached the stage when they need
sedentary work. And it meets, at all
times, the need of the right men of ser-
vice training to be brought into contact
with the right job.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Korean Peace Prospects.
The agreement of the North Korean
and Chinese commanders to hold talks
for an armistice with the U.N.O.
command at least holds some seeds of
hope that peace may come in the Far
Eastern zone. But it is a very slender
hope.
The world has learned to regard with
the gravest suspicion any move which
originates in Moscow. There is usually
behind it some motive based on Russia’s
policy for promotion of world revolu-
tion, and half a dozen possibilities
immediately occur to the mind in this
case.
The Kremlin may be setting the stage
for its manoeuvres to have Communist
China included in the Japanese peace
talks. It may be that China needs its
troops —“volunteers” as they are supposed
to be —for other operations, such as a
descent on Indo-China and Siam, one
of those staunch democracies of U.N.O.
where the Marines have, within the past
week, kidnapped the Prime Minister
and the Navy has failed to take over the
country. Or Peking may be preparing
for the invasion of Formosa ; or perhaps
the Persian situation has some link with
Mr. Malik’s original move, Russia being
in process, in case Britain should send
troops to Abadan, of demonstrating to
the world its dove-like qualities before
invading the Iranian plateau. Or the
step may be just another move in the
plan to create a “World Front for Peace”
—meaning a world front for the preven-
tion of defence against Soviet aggression.
The world hopes that what has hap-
pened is due to none of these things,
though few speak with the confidence of
Mr. Trygve Lie, the United Nations
general-secretary, who thinks that the
approach might “prove in the long run to
be the key to peace throughout the
world,” a hope which seems dim in view
of the behavior of Persia, the country which
provides Mr. Lie’s organisation with a
(just now) remarkably silent president.
If peace does arise out of the discus-
sions it will be more than welcome, especi-
ally to the Americans, who have had
upwards of 200,000 casualties without
even achieving a definite conception of
what concrete conditions they are actually
fighting to obtain for the far-from-grateful
South Koreans, whose conceptions of war
are a perennial headache to the U.N.O.
commanders.
The S. Koreans have set up indepen-
dent “minimum requirements,” which the
Chinese and North Koreans are unlikely
to accept. They call, in effect, for the
sovereign control of the whole of Korean
territory by the South Koreans, the com-
plete retirement of the Chinese and the
complete surrender and disarmament of
the North Koreans as even a first basis
for peace negotiations.
It is a situation which every Western
nation would be well out of, but out of
which it is difficult to get with dignity and
the necessary “face” in view of the Japan-
ese idea of Korea as a security risk in
Communist hands, “a spearhead aimed at
the heart of Nippon.” A display of
weakness by the West at this stage might
have alarming effects on the Japanese
respect for Western power on the eve of
the making of the Japanese peace treaty.
A Remedy of Despair.
All the excuses of Ministers, primed to
a show of unanimity in the special
Cabinet committee which approved the
increased postal, telegraph and telephone
charges, do not alter the fact that the
Post Office, confronted with increasing
demands for its services, is either unable
or unwilling to meet those demands, and
regards increased business as only the
harbinger of great annual losses.
This is the very negation of business
enterprise. The heavy additional im-
posts can only be designed to deter cus-
tomers with penalties. If the P.M.G.
knows of no other means of meeting
losses than to raise charges so as to re-
duce custom, then he is simply setting
a precedent for annual deficits. It is
understood that the central post offices in
the capital cities have been unable to
cope with the mail business offering. That
is a rank confession of failure. If the
P.M.G. and his advisers feel like that
with 8,000,000 people to serve, what will
conditions and charges be like with a
population of 10, 12 or 20 millions?
The United States telephone system is
not a Government undertaking, and it
not only flourishes steadily under rapidly
rising demands on it but even supplies
instruments in any quantity free to cus-
tomers. Why, then, should the Aus-
tralian Government monopoly in this ser-
vice fold up at the prospect of a wait-
ing-list of a few tens of thousands as
though it were a “back-log” impossible
to reduce?
Somewhere, somehow, the Common-
wealth Government has to draw the line
against bloated public services which
can’t give service, and against rising costs
of administration where the absolutely
last resort of those in authority is to
reduce overhead expenses. If the course
pursued by the Postal Department is
typical of the Government’s attitude
generally a collapse of public spending
on anything but bare necessities (an in-
evitable consequence sooner or later) will
deliver a knock-out blow.
Jubilee Art.
The great attraction of the Jubilee exhibi-
tion of Australian art, organised for the
Plastic Arts Committee by Laurence
Thomas in Melbourne, is that as it goes
to each of the capital cities in turn people
in all States will be able to see a lot of
very beautiful paintings not held by their
own galleries.
Thus at the N. S. Wales National
Gallery, where the show is now filling three
big courts, Sydney people may see, per-
haps for the first time, Tom Roberts’s
“The Breakaway,” loaned to the collec-
tion from Adelaide; and so may realise
that, vigorous in action and alive with
sunlight though the picture is, the English
visitor who recently declared in a book
that the drover and his horse were about
to be “trampled to death by the charging
sheep” was a little overexcited by the
stirring scene.
Then there are the two Conders from
the Melbourne Gallery and another from
a private collection, suave in texture,
rich in their deep notes of color. And
a large, restful Rupert Bunny, in his
earlier manner, from the Melbourne
Gallery and an opulent “Rape of Perse-
phone,” in his later style, from the col-
lection of Daryl Lindsay,
Longstaff’s “Portrait of the Artist’s
Wife,” from Adelaide, a profoundly
beautiful work, should surely astonish
people acquainted only with his profes-
sional trade-jobs. It is a pity that the
collection does not include, as a com-
panion-piece, Lambert’s self-portrait from
Adelaide, which —though Sydney’s “The
White Glove” clearly enough demon-
strates his genius—has often been
described as his masterpiece.
New again to Sydney is Frederick Mc-
Cubbin’s “The Lost Child,” owned by
the Melbourne Gallery ; and if the lost
child is a little sentimental in the fashion
of the period, and lacks drama, and
might really have only lost her handker-
chief, the picture is still a fine piece of
Australian bush. And—though it is
astounding that the collection contains no
example of his later, more characteristic
work —there is a deep quite dignity in
Max Meldrum’s “Portrait of the Artist’s
Mother,” from Melbourne; and some-
thing queerly dramatic in James Quinn’s
“Portrait of Mrs. Ord Marshall,” lent by
the artist.
There is a good Walter Withers from
Melbourne, a Tom Roberts portrait from
Adelaide, a Hugh Ramsay portrait of a
girl (from a private collection); and,
again from Melbourne, and twice as
mighty in the blue-and-tawny original as
it is in the pretty-pretty prints that most
people have seen, Streeton’s superb “The
Purple Noon’s Transparent Might.”
All this, with some splendid pictures
from the Sydney Gallery, with five
Dobells, including the captivating “Saddle-
My-Nag” from Mr. Norman Schureck’s
collection, and with a wide representation
of the “colonial” period of Gill and
Martens, would indeed seem an occasion
for jubilation; and so, up to a point,
it is. But the exhibition is, unfortu-
nately, more historical than critical; more
like another stroke in the great game of
boosting the most doubtful modems than a
demonstration of sound connoisseurship ;
and, both for what is included and for
what is not included, it will be received
as a whole only with very moderate
approval.
Of course a certain amount of heart-
burning is inevitable when an exhibition
of this kind is arranged. Everybody
can’t be put in. But three things, at least,
that have been done here, or not done,
are quite incredible: the restriction of
Norman Lindsay’s exhibit —to be com-
pared, say, with the seven Lamberts —to
one large pendrawing (admittedly a fine
example) and one minute watercolor no
larger than a Hilder; the restriction of
Gruner —to be compared with the four
Streetons, two of them very large— to a
single small landscape; and —to be com-
pared with the inclusion of such minor or
unformed talents as those of Sidney
Nolan, Justin O’Brien, Arthur Boyd and
Eric Thake —the complete omission of
Lance Solomon.
After that, the knowledgeable visitor
can make bis own list of prominent
absentees; there are dozens of them —
Mary Edwards, Townshend, Eldershaw,
Percy Lindsay, Namatjira, Dargie, George
Lawrence. Even such long-established
names as those of Penleigh Boyd, Lister
Lister, J. Muir Auld and B. E. Minns
are missing. The obvious course for the
selectors, if they were to include these
and other admirable painters, was to have
restricted all artists to a single entry,
representing them at their best; and to
have made the bold decision that, if the
aboriginal bark-paintings are humanly
and ethnologically fascinating, to include
modernist paintings representing the
decline of a great tradition to about the
same infantile level, was merely silly.

Butter or Chocolate Malted.
A minor butter famine in Australia’s
largest city, due mainly to the collapse
in the national transport system, brought
out the usual crop of official statements
and of dairy industry “spokesmen” crying
for a higher price.
Deserving as the dairyfarmer may be
of a higher price, anybody who supposes
that this would magically produce more
butter needs his brains brushed. What
it is more likely to do is accelerate
bidding between milk processors and
butter factories for milk. When the
housewife pays more for butter the
farmer gets it by an increased price for
his cream, but milk processors will outbid
the cream increase.
In the last pre-war year total Australian
butter production was 211,988 tons. It
has never been near that since. In
1949-50 it was 173,200 tons, the most
since 1940-41. That’s pretty close to
501 b. for every head of population. About
7flb. of that 501 b, was exported, leaving
about 42flb, a year, or 3flb. a month,
for every man, woman and child.
In 1939 there were 2.6 million cows in
milk, in 1950 they had fallen to 2.35
million. And whereas 925 million gallons
of milk went into butter production in
1939, the figure was down to 817 million
last year. Milk for cheese jumped from
65 million in 1939 to 97 million last year.
But—and this is the point—where not
quite 200 million gallons went into con-
densed and powdered milks, ice-cream,
milk-bars, chocolates and the rest of it
in 1939, the quantity had jumped to
nearly 340 million last year.
These Commonwealth Statistician’s
figures show plainly that butter produc-
tion is falling because Australians (and
a growing export market) are taking milk
from butter factories in vastly increased
quantities for consumption as drinks, con-
densed and powdered milk, sweets and
various canned preparations based on
milk.
What will be lost, unless dairy herds
are multiplied, is the butter-export trade.
Dairy herds won’t multiply in an era of
overfull employment, overcrowded cities,
and inflated wages for short hours. The
Cinderella of the land industries simply
cannot stand up to the economic pressure
of such a set-up, and no fairy prince is
in sight to rescue it.
The Sydney shortage is a passing phase.
There is, as yet, enough butter to supply
all. But the warning is plain enough and
it seems astonishing that it didn’t appear
before this.
Protectors Unashamed.
Decisions of the State “Labor” Govern-
ments in N.S.W. and Queensland
against any equipment of the Common-
wealth Government with powers for
effectual anti-Communist action were ex-
pressed in terms showing plainly that the
controlling influences in the “Labor”
party are unashamed protectors of the
Communists.
N.S.W. Premier McGirr stated as his
reason that the Commonwealth has
sufficient means of action in the Crimes
Act. He is the only figure in our public
life who thinks so; and, anyway, is at
odds with the entire “ ‘Labor’ movement”
on the application of the Crimes Act.
Queensland “Labor” Cabinet, in the
absence of Mr. Hanlon in hospital—but
that made no difference —replied that the
Commonwealth’s request was “the thin
end of the wedge attacking trade-
unions.”
The only State “Labor” Ministry with
any guts in this business is the Tas-
manian, which agreed with the Com-
monwealth representations.
A referendum is now certain, and had
best be held quickly. What these
“Labor” refusals mean is that the A.L.P.
will campaign for refusal at that referen-
dum of the powers sought. That the
whole N.S.W. “movement” erupted in
panic denunciation of the Communists
during the 1949 coal strike—and none
more vehement for their utter destruc-
tion than the McGirr Ministry’s deputy-
leader —was only a desperate shift to
save that Government’s life at the pros-
pective elections. It was only just saved,
and by the use of political bribes for
votes.
That the Queensland “Labor” Gov-
ernment was nearly knocked out by the
nine-weeks’ Communist blockade of that
State in 1948—something like that lately
seen in New Zealand —has taught the
Hanlon Government also nothing what-
ever. Yet at that time Mr. Hanlon de-
clared that the Communist general strike
there contained “all the elements of civil
war.” He said:
The Communist-party “High command”
has invaded Queensland. Its policy is
purely destructive, and aims at disorder
What do they think we are? Are we to
be pushed around like a lot of slaves?
I have yet to learn that Queenslanders
have abandoned their love of freedom and
will bend their knees before a lot of
mimicking Molotovs.
But apparently the Hanlon Government
will bend the knee to a whole mob of
such rather than make joint cause in
ending these wreckers’ power.
The new Leader of the Opposition at
Canberra, too, will have no option. Mr.
Ferguson, head of the A.L.P. Federal
executive, speaks from behind the scenes
the words which “Labor” Governments
in the “No” States have uttered. His
ukase is that for “Labor” to “associ-
ate itself with reaction” in fighting Com-
munism, and especially to ban the Com-
munists, would be fatal—to the “Labor”
party. Anything, in short, that would be
fatal to the Communists would be fatal
to “Labor.”
While this hubbub claimed the atten-
tion of “the movement” a small dog-figh*t
started on the outskirts—to wit, some
angry protests in the Commo-run Vic-
torian A.R.U, about union funds being
used to finance the trip of its Communist
boss Brown to a W.F.T.U. meeting in
Vienna. Voicing this resentment, Mr.
Scully, “Labor” M.L.A., urged in the Vic-
torian Parliament that the Federal Gov-
ernment should control the movement of
Communists “who go away to the other
side of the world so that they can come
back to Australia bigger and better
traitors.” But, poor fellow, at the com-
ing referendum he will be ordered to vote
“No,” assuring that “bigger and better
traitors” are in constant supply.
Polish Commemoration.
Last Friday Poles living in Australia, in
common with their compatriots through-
out the free world, commemorated the
tenth anniversary of the death of
Paderewski, Polish patriot, famous
pianist and first Prime Minister of
modern Poland.
When Paderewski was born in 1860
Poland as a nation did not exist. Its
territory had been split up among
Russia, Prussia and Austria in the three
“partitions” by which those predatory
Powers took advantage of the straits to
which weak government had brought a
once powerful kingdom. But if “Free-
dom shriek’d as Kosciusko fell,” its
spirit did not die in Poland. Both
Russia and Germany, and to some ex-
tent Austria, found that the Poles did
not take at all kindly to the role of a
subject race.
The First World War gave the Poles
their chance to re-emerge as a nation; ‘
but more than a century of partition and
the fact that they were conscripted into
the armies of opposing Powers made it
difficult for patriots to arrive at a com-
mon plan or policy. In the United
States, however, Jan Ignace Paderewski,
who in 40 years as a piano virtuoso had
become the most widely-known man of
his race, began working for the freedom
of his country, and it was largely due
to him that President Wilson became in-
terested in a “united, independent and
autonomous Poland.” After the col-
lapse of Russia in 1917 the Allies de-
clared in favor of a free and united
Poland, and the war’s end found the
country free, though far from united
under army leader Pilsudski.
Paderewski arrived in Warsaw and
took over as Prime Minister; confirmed
at an election soon afterwards. He
represented Poland at the Versailles
Peace Conference, but, unable to agree
with the military party over the boundary
wars it was eager to wage, he resigned
at the end of 1919 and quit politics alto-
gether a year later.
In 1921 Paderewski returned to
America, and it was nearly 20 years be-
fore he was again engaged in the affairs
of his country. When, on the invasion
of Poland by Germany in 1939, Presi-
dent Moscicki fled to Rumania, Pade-
rewski was asked to succeed him. He
declined because of ill health, but in
January, 1940, after the Fourth Partition
of Poland, he became President of the
Polish Government-in-exile. For the

second time his name became a symbol
for his countrymen abroad, and a Polish
army fought with distinction in the
Allied cause in Europe and North
Africa. He died in New York on June
29, 1941.
A special significance "attaches to last
week’s commemoration. The Poles in
this country—the Council of Polish
Associations claims there are 60,000 of
them —represent an average cross-section
of the population of their homeland.
They are the sons of a race which for
over a century, under three alien rulers,
cherished a love for freedom, and found
it at last only to lose it again after a
few fleeting years. Today’s nominal in-
dependence, under rulers appointed by
Moscow, is not likely to be any more
palatable to such a people than was the
direct rule of the emperors and the tsars.
And that goes for most of the subject
races of Eastern Europe.
POLITICAL POINTS
The Im-Post Office.
The situation in Persia has developed
a “pull-devil-pull-baker air” while the
matter of Abadan has been taken to the
International Court by the British. The
Anglo-Persian stand is: “No agreement,
no technical help, thus no oil.” The
Persian stand is: “No technical help, no
technicians we’ll shoot them for
sabotage.” And that comes strangely
indeed from the country of Dr. Evatt’s
current successor as president of the
U.N.O. Assembly.
Left-wingers and others who uphold
the Persian Government’s right to seize
the Abadan oil refineries should take a
peek at the same crowd’s proposed anti-
sabotage bill under which any act holding
up the flow of oil will be punishable and
military courts will have the power to
order the death penalty. Moussadek, who
first flourished this bill as a threat against
British employees at the refinery, in an
attempt to intimidate them into working
for his newly-established State oil com-
pany, has now explained that the bill is
not aimed at British employees. It must,
then, be directed at his own people. Any
left-wingers in favor of the death penalty
for any act holding up delivery of coal?
Mr. Nehru’s first reaction to the Persian
Oil Grab was that it was a very good
thing. Now he’s not so sure —three-
quarters of India’s oil comes from
Abadan.
P.M. Menzies made a long statement in
Parliament last week on the theme that
the conditions under which the Australian
3rd Royal Battalion is serving in Korea
are almost perfect with every comfort,
abundant leave and almost embarrassing
amenities. Judging by the wealth of
witnesses whose testimony was produced
by the Prime Minister, almost the only
people in Korea who have not heard
about the lucky state of the 3rd Royals
are the men of the 3rd Royals.
Downer, M.H.R. for Angas (S.A.), sug-
gested last week that Canberra might well
pass back to the States some of its
revenue fields, such as entertainments-
tax and sales-tax. His argument is that
the present system, under which the States
have spending authority, but little taxing
authority, is a danger to responsible
government, and he urges—as Professor
Bland did when moving the Address-in-
Reply—the summoning of a constitutional
convention. No official notice seems to
have been taken of the earnest advice of
Bland and others, but that should not
deter them from continuing to urge it.
As reported, a British maker has pro-
duced a “beer-proof, shock-proof,
kick-proof piano” for Army canteens.
It seems also to be the kind of citizen the
Socialists are endeavoring to evolve.
Federal Arbitration Court last week
upset the verdict of a Moscow trial by
which the Ironworkers’ Association had
expelled L. Short, secretary of the Indus-
trial Group within the union. Short
had been charged by the Communist-
controlled executive with having received
money to weaken and destroy the union.
The Court found that there was no
reasonable evidence to support the charge,
decided that Short had been improperly
expelled and ordered his reinstatement.
Costs were awarded against the 21 mem-
bers of the conference who voted for
Short’s expulsion.
Comprehensive report on Korea
policies:
One would have lingering wars with little
cost;
Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
A third thinks, without expense at all,
By guileful fair words peace may be

N.S.W. Government Transport Com-
mission took over Sydney Ferries on Sun-
day and on Monday Mr. Winsor and his
operating staff made a tour of the service
points with the object of “seeing how the
ferries can be run at a profit.” If this
zeal spreads they may soon make a tour
of the Government’s other transport ser-
vices with the same aim in view.
When the Red Dean was dispensing
his pink fairy-floss in Australia last year
he was asked who paid the expenses of
his trips to Russia and elsewhere. He
replied that the Peace Council was spon-
soring his Australian trip, but as to the
rest of his travels he regarded such a
question as an impertinence. There is
not much room for doubt as to who
footed the bill for the saintly-looking old
humbug’s latest pilgrimage to Moscow.
He went there to receive the “Stalin In-
ternational Prize for Peace” —no mere
medal depicting a dove and olive branch,
but several thousand pounds in hard cash.
It seems to be the Kremlin open season
for paying out hard cash. On the same
day that Dean Johnson made a speech
in Moscow maligning his own country and
hailing Stalin as “the greatest man in the
world” it was announced that Russia
would pay to Persia, in gold, over
£5,000,000 which had been owing since
the war years. But for the fact that
Marxian philosophy doesn’t recognise
such a thing as chance, it would seem to
be a remarkable coincidence that the
decision to pay this debt came just as
the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. stopped pay-
ment of royalties, the Persian Govern-
ment’s main source of revenue.
Holding that the South Australian
transport system hasn’t recovered from
the effects of war, and that the standard
must remain “sub-normal” for some time,
a Royal Commission justifies increased
rail fares, wants trams made more effi-
cient and in some places replaced by
buses, wants road-transport control con-
tinued and limits on road-transport taxa-
tion removed and the amount left to the
discretion of the controlling authority.
This, of course, is a purely State report
influenced by State prejudice. Transport
has long ceased to be purely a State affair,
and no improvement will appear until it is
recognised as an urgent national problem
and dealt with as such.
N.S.W, Full Court has put a stopper
on the McGrrrrr notion that anybody’s
property can be “acquired” by the State
at will. .At Young (N.S.W.) the Rural
Bank wanted a town allotment, so the
Minister for Works was asked to resume
it. He did so. The land was then
“brought into the category of Crown
land” and vested in the Rural Bank. The
owner appealed to the court, which held
the whole business invalid. It came out
that “counsel for the Minister indicated
that the ethics of it had not been con-
sidered by the Minister.” “Ethics” is
not in the lexicon of the McGrrrrrs.
A few questions for the P.M.G.: (1)
In the year ended June 30, what sum, if
any, was credited to his department by
other Commonwealth departments for the
use of post and telegraph facilities? (2)
What sum, if any, was received from
State Government departments? (3)
What sum, if any, was recovered by his
department from other Commonwealth
departments to offset salaries and wages
of his staff engaged in handling the busi-
ness of other departments, e.g., in paying
out pensions and child endowment,
answering inquiries regarding electoral
matters, social services and so on?
During the early years of Federation
each State continued to issue its own
postage stamps and the ordinary letter
rate was one penny in Victoria, twopence
in most of the other States, Common-
wealth penny postage was introduced in
1911 and lasted seven years; the first
change from it was the imposition of a
ha’penny War Postage Tax, in 1918,
which was discontinued two years later,
the ordinary postage rate being simul-
taneously increased to 2d. Subsequent
changes were: Down to l|d. in 1923, up
to 2d. again in 1930, up to 2}d. (War
Postage Tax again) in 1941, This rate
continued into the peace years until the
P.M.G. upped it another ha’penny last
November. Now he’s done it again. Oh,
for another Rowland Hill!
At the new price of 6|d. a pound, Aus-
tralians will still get their sugar cheaper
than a lot of other people. It’s 9d. in
N.Z., 7d, in Sweden, lOd. in Canada and
the U.S.A., 14d. in France and 18d. in
Italy. And the increase goes to the
growers, refiners and distributors, not to
the retail trade.
Second trial of Queensland Chief
Electoral Officer B. J, Maguire on a
charge of having forged a ballot-paper
at the Bulimba election, ended, as did
the earlier one, with a jury unable to
agree on a verdict. In summing up, Judge
Philp said that the evidence showed that
the paper was forged, and that there was
no doubt that Maguire had had access to
the ballot papers at the Electoral Office,
but so had other people. It was for the
jury to decide whether Maguire did or did
not “determinedly withhold delivery” of
a package of 53 ballot-papers, also
whether he gave faked samples of his
handwriting to the police. He did not
think they would convict on those matters
alone. The substance of the Crown case
was the identification of the accused by
his handwriting. A police handwriting-
expert claimed there were 15 peculiari-
ties common to the writing on the forged
ballot-papers and Maguire’s handwriting.
After being locked up overnight the jury
reported it was unable to agree. Maguire
was remanded until July 23.
N.S.W. Transport Minister Sheahan
has made an impassioned plea to Menzies
to redraft the Anti-Communist Bill, which,
he says, in its present form, “would
create a police State.” He wants a new
clause in the Act to read; —-
Whosoever gives or procures the giving,
by any means whatsoever, of any false or
misleading information by which any person
is prejudiced or injured in his character,
trade, occupation or calling, shall be guilty
of an offence punishable by fine,
or imprisonment or both.
Penalties suggested for false or misleading
information: Imprisonment, minimum six
months, maximum 10 years. Fines, mini-
mum £lOO, maximum £lO,OOO.
Sheahan could scarcely have thought of
a better weapon for intimidating would-
be witnesses against Communism. If his
principles applied in the ordinary courts
every innocent but mistaken witness would
risk jail.
McGrrrrr’s reason—or one of ’em—
for not agreeing to transfer to the Com-
monwealth power to outlaw the Com-
munist party is that the Federal Govern-
ment already has sufficient power to deal
with Communists under the Crimes Act.
Rather strange, in view of the fact that
McGrrrrr, like every other member of
the “Labor” party, is pledged to work
for the repeal of those sections of the
Crimes Act under which such action
could be taken —or attempted,
A Sydney paper is encouraged by the
appointment of F. J. S. Wise, former
leader of the W.A. “Labor” Opposition,
as Administrator of the N.T.:
Better times [may be] opening for that
much-neglected land. Mr. Wise’s training
in tropical agriculture, his personal know-
ledge of North Australia and his experience
of public administration... .equip him with
an unusual combination of qualifications
for the post.
True, but has he the patience to wait in
Darwin while Canberra drowses over his
correspondence for months and years?
What Mr. Wise needs, in addition to his
other qualifications, is more freedom to
make and implement his own decisions.
One of the wonders of Canberra is the
manner in which the Senate proceedings
have been changed from a perennial riot
into something that resembles a genial
day in the House of Lords. The resem-
blance was all the more marked last
week through the presence of Senator
Donald Grant—described by a well-
wisher as “the most faded Red in the
party”—garbed in a tweed suit of
peculiar hue exactly like a famous one
the Duke of Sutherland used to wear a
couple of decades ago.
Just before he left London to come
home via France, Switzerland and Italy,
Queensland Transport Minister Duggan
said he did not fear Queensland’s “big
transport programme” would be impeded
by British rearmament. The British, he
added, believed that maintenance of an
efficient transport system in Australia was
necessary to an overall defence plan.
Which would be all right—if we had an
efficient transport system.
. “8.D.”: A few months ago John Baker-
White, Conservative member for Canter-
bury, proposed in the Commons that
“farm-workers who have not the benefit
of canteens available to the majority of
industrial workers” should be given an
additional meat ration “equal to that
already given to mine-workers.” After
the motion had remained near the bottom
of the paper for some time another
member asked Mr. Chuter Ede, Home
Secretary and Leader of the House,
whether the Government intended to de-
bate the motion. Ede’s reply was “No.”
This Socialist lack of concern for the wel-
fare of men on the land is not surprising;
of the 314 Attlee men in Britain’s Parlia-
ment only two are farmers, compared
with 47 teachers and lecturers, 40 lawyers
and enough trade-union officials to start a
Parliament of their own. Hence, prob-
ably, the African peanut-scheme and the
Gambia egg-farm.
It seems certain that “Labor” will
urge its supporters to vote “No” on the
question of giving the Federal Govern-
ment power to deal with Communists.
Strange, seeing that “Labor’s” platform
provides for the transfer of all State
powers to the Commonwealth. But then,
so much of “Labor’s” policy is strange
nowadays.

John Mcllwraith Industries
This Melbourne sheet-lead and
plumbers’-supplies business had
its beginnings nearly a century
ago, when (in 1854) John Mc-
llwraith, lately from Scotland,
set up as an importer and
merchant. Later he helped found
the shipping business of Mc-
llwraith, McEachara, Ltd.
Up to the outbreak of World
War I John Mcllwraith and
Co.’s manufacturing activities
had been chiefly confined to the
making of lead sheet, pipes
and traps used in the plumbing
trade; but local shortages
prompted the management to
turn to making plumbers’ brass-
ware as well, and today the co.
operates one of the largest and
most efficient factories in the
southern hemisphere.
Recently the present public
co., John Mcllwraith Industries,
Ltd., was formed to take over the
assets of John Mcllwraith and
Co, Pty., Ltd., including the
shares in eight subsidiary cos.,
and the land and buildings
owned by J. and D. Mcllwraith
Investments Pty, The present
public co., through these pur-
chases, has acquired freeholds in
Little Col tins-street, a large
modem factory at Richmond
and branch stores at Caulfield
and Preston.
Early this year the public was
offered 500,000 10s. ord. stock-
units at 16s. Bd. each. The
offering was restricted to clients
of the selling brokers, to nomi-
nees of the vendors and to other
recognised brokers. It was
promptly taken up.
The new public co., after re-
valuation on “a conservative
basis,” kicked off with a paid
capital of £1,000,000 in stock-
units of 10s. each.
The co. distributes through
subsidiaries and agents in South
Australia, W.A., Queensland and
Tasmania. In N. S. Wales an
associate co. manufactures as
well as distributes. The Sydney
co.’s cast-iron enamelled baths,
sinks, basins, etc., are handled
in the southern States by John
Mcllwraith Industries, Ltd.
The parent concern stresses
the fact that it has harmonious
employer-employee relations. It
has stated that “with the co-
operation of our factory em-
ployees it was not necessary to
increase brassware prices on the
change from a 44-hour to a 40-
hour week.”
On the basis of present capi-
talisation of the business
(£1,000,000), profits of the group
were 2.2 p.c. on capital in 1946,
4.2 p.c. in 1947, 5.2 p.c. in 1948,
5.9 p.c. in 1949 and 15 p.c. in
1950. These profits are calcu-
lated after providing for ordinary
company taxes but not undistri-
buted-profits tax, and no adjust-
ment has been made to bring
into the accounts the greater pro-
vision for depreciation that may
be necessary following the
writing-up of assets in Sep-
tember, 1950.
In the memorandum of sale of
the stock-units, dated March 29,
1951, the directors say they ex-
pect the earnings of the co. to be
maintained at the 1950 basis,
“and anticipate no difficulty in
paying dividends at the rate of
10 p.c. p.a.” Finances are cer-
tainly comfortable enough, and,
on the 1950 earning-rate of
15 p.c., there would be £50,000
a year for reserves (subject to
undistributed-profits tax) after
paying a 10 p.c. div.

After deducting net intangible
assets, on the figures at Dec. 31,
1950, each 10s. stock-unit in
John Mcllwraith Industries had
a net tangible backing of 7s. 6d.
The stock-units have been
very abtive in both Melbourne
and Sydney. Last week there
were dealings in Melbourne at
225. 6d., at which figure the yield
would be £4 Bs. lOd. per cent, on
a 10 p.c. div. basis.
Newcastle Harbor
“Abdul Assiz”: Although the
much-publicised Richard Vowell i
has been drag-suction dredging
in Newcastle Harbor for the
past seven months, the condi-
tion of the third port of the
Commonwealth is causing con-
siderable anxiety to all interests
whose fate, as well as that of
much of Australia, is dependent
on the prosperity of the coal
and steel metropolis.
At a conference in February
last it was stated that the steel-
works channel would be in use
in a few weeks, but the position
in mid-June was that the North
Harbor had silted up again.
Ships with cargoes destined for
the Newcastle steelworks had
still to go to Port Kembla to
off-load to 21ft; the fact that
the steelworks channel had been
dredged down to 25ft. was dis-
counted by a depth of only 19ft.
in the North Harbor Leads.
Responsible authorities antici-
pated some time ago that the
steelworks channel could be
reached and used by fully-laden
ships in mid-June, but their
forecast was wide of the mark.
The majority opinion, amongst
those best able to judge, is that
the harbor, as a whole, has con-
tinued to deteriorate. Up-
harbor the Hexham channel has
filled to Bft., and the silt accumu-
lated there is being swept into
the main harbor by floods fol-
lowing on wet weather.
The Richard Vowell, over a
six-months working period, has
moved approximately 1£ million
tons of silt, which is less than
half, its expected performance,
and is also less than the silt
deposition over a corresponding
period under average weather
conditions. The latest figures
for the total of silt removed by
all dredges over recent weeks
indicate a removal - rate of
110,000 tons a week, so that
there will be little margin to
cope with flood-silting.
Presumably with this fact in
view, the Government has called
for tenders by outside interests
for the removal of two million
tons of silt. This may alleviate
the position somewhat, but the
reason for the setting of this
arbitrary limit is obscure, par-
ticularly as a Dutch firm has
plant and technicians in Victoria
capable of operating on a much
larger scale.
Incidentally, the Dutch experts
are reported to have advised the
authorities that drag-suction
dredging is not suited to New-
castle Harbor conditions, as it
spreads the silt, which then sets
hard.
If Australia’s third port is to
survive energetic and drastic
remedies are needed, but the in-
sistent demand for the first ob-
vious step of appointing single-
authority port control has not
yet been met. The inter-State
shipping service is now reduced
to the lowest level that New-
castle has ever suffered. In the
first quarter of this year there
were only two general-cargo
ships from Melbourne, and the
service from other ports was
practically non-existent; prior
to 1939 there was a regular bi-
weekly service from Melbourne
and Brisbane, and there were
regular services from Adelaide
and Fremantle.
To make matters worse, the
overseas attitude towards ship-
ments to Australia is now
hardening. In its report for
1950 the Liverpool Steam Ship
"Put that one on the ice till tomorrow, chief—I've
reached the ‘darg' for today."
Owners’ Association stated that
it took an average of four weeks
longer to discharge in Australia
than in almost any other part
of the world, and that this
“unnecessary idleness” was
equivalent to the withdrawal of
30 ships from the United King-
dom-Australia run for the whole
year.
Moran and Cato, Ltd.
There are 2,000,000 shares of
10s. each issued in Moran and
Cato. These were last week
priced at 295. 9d., to yield, on the
basis of the last dividend
(15 p.c.), just over 5 p.c.
The point on which the share-
market seems to place special
importance is the announce-
ment made by the chairman at
the last annual meeting: “Dis-
tributions of profits for this
period should not be regarded
as a definite indication of future
dividend policy.” It was added
that it might be necessary to
retain “appreciable” profits to
provide for increased working-
capital requirements.
Profits of Moran and Cato
and its subsidiaries averaged
13.4 p.c. on present capital for
the five years to the latter half
of 1949. The figure for the
1949 period, before allowing for
public-co. undistributed profits
tax, was 14.3 p.c. These ratios
are below the rate of div.
(15 p.c.) for 1950, which was
paid on a lower capital.
On present capital, earnings
for the 1950 term would seem
to have been enough to meet a
15 p.c. div., but they were
subject to difference in account-
ing periods of the group. Earn-
ings for 1951 should give a truer
picture, with the probability of
a somewhat higher rate ; though
it has been pointed out that
52 p.c. of the lines handled by
the group are price-controlled.
and yield a gross-profit margin
of little more than 12 p.c.
The most attractive feature
about the stock is its solid
backing, financial and otherwise.
There are 148 M. and C. branches
(92 freehold), mostly in Vic-
toria, apart from the factory
and other premises in Fitzroy.
The co. also has 46 shops and
five cottages leased to outside
tenants. Sixteen blocks of
vacant land await removal of
building difficulties. Moran and
Cato (N.S.W.) Pty. operates 77
retail shops and owns 38 of the
freeholds.
The original business was
founded by T. E, Moran in
1876. F. J. Cato entered the
partnership in 1882. A pro-
prietary was formed in 1912,
and it issued 43,700 £1 shares for
the Fitzroy headquarters, etc.,
but the partners retained the
freehold of many of the
branches. Some of these have
since been bought by the co. at
independent valuation.
Morhn and Cato (N.S.W.)
was registered in 1909. In 1924
Sydney Grocery Pty. was formed
as a wholesale house, and Aus-
tralian Grocery Pty. the same
year in Victoria. In the first
two cos. M. and C. executives
took up a substantial proportion
of the shares.
In January, 1950, Moran and
Cato wrote up its freeholds by
£50,000, and used the proceeds
to issue 100,000 10s. shares to
holders of some cum. par. pref.
shares, which thereafter became
ords. At thi/i point the parent’s
paid capital became £425,000 in
10s. shares. It was then agreed
to take over the shares in the
three associated proprietary cos.
for £463,200 in 10s. shares. A
public issue of 223,600 10s.
ords. was then made (in August,
1950) at a 100 p.c. premium.
In the whole operation there
was some writing-up of free-
holds. But the prospectus of
the public issue stated that:
The written-up values of these
properties was substantially less
than the increases which the valua-
tions would have justified. Apart
from this, no writing-up of proper-
ties, stock, plant or fixtures has
taken place in connection with the
readjustment made as a preliminary
to the recent issue. The present
book-values of property, plant,
machinery and shop-fittings are con-
sidered by the directors to be much
below present market or replacement
values.
Net tangible assets, on these
apparently conservative book-
values, amount to something
round 12s. per 10s. share, allow-
ing for the new issue and
premium.


VICKERS LIMITED
A SUCCESSFUL YEAR
IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION
TO REARMAMENT
PROGRAMME
REVIEW BY CHAIRMAN,
LIEUT.-GENERAL SIR RONALD M. WEEKS
The eighty-fourth annual general meeting of Vickers, Ltd., was held on
June 5 in London, Lt.-General Sir Ronald M. Weeks, K.C.8., C.8.E.,
D. 5.0., M.C., T.D. (the chairman), presiding.
A detailed review by the Chairman of the group’s activities had been
circulated to members with the report and accounts for the year ended
December 31, 1950, in the course of which it was stated:
At the Cockatoo Docks & Engineering Co. Pty. Limited at Sydney, lack
of labour has prevented the acceptance of many general engineering orders,
but during 1950 a considerable amount of work has been carried out for
various cement companies. Vickers Ruwolt Proprietary Limited, ot
Melbourne, has had a successful year. Output is a record for peacetime,
both in volume and value, and profits are in line with this upward trend,
but production is still hampered by the current shortages of labour and
materials. The heavy engineering products of the Company are still in
demand, and the order book is also a peacetime record. Equipment is
supplied for the mining, rubber and paper industries, a wide range of
hydraulic presses is manufactured, and, under an agreement with Robert
Boby Limited, the Company is now producing equipment for the malting
trade. Future prospects are regarded as excellent.
Chairman’s Additional Remarks
Addressing the meeting the Chairman said: —
1950 has been a successful year. The most satisfying feature in the
year’s results is that our output of commercial products has shown a steady
increase in volume and variety, and it is from this source that much of the
income of the parent company has been derived.
We have satisfied ourselves that we can hold pur own in the commercial
field and it is unfortunate, though I am the first to admit that it is so
essential from the national angle, that more of our manufacturing capacity
will now be required for the rearmament programme and we are being
compelled to ease up on some of our commercial activities.
The pattern of the rearmament programme, as far as we are concerned,
has been gradually materialising during the last few months and our
contribution, as in the past, will be an important one.
Increased Demand for New Ships
Perhaps one of the major changes since I addressed you a year ago has
been the greatly increased demand for new ships, especially tankers. Whereas
in May, 1950, we were looking for orders, the position now is that we
have a very heavy and long-dated order bodk.
The Chairman’s review gave the details of ships under construction or
orders received in 1950; since January 1, 1951, we have received further
orders for; One passenger liner of 28,500 tons gross for the Orient Line;
one passenger liner of 8,000 tons gross for the Union Steam Ship Company
of New Zealand; one passenger cargo liner of 8,300 tons gross for Alfred
Holt and Co.; one passenger cargo liner of 9,300 tons gross for the Furness
Withy Line; two tankers of 32,000 tons d.w. for the British Tanker
Company; two tankers of 26,650 tons d.w. for the Esso Petroleum Company;
three tankers of 18,000 tons d.w. for the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company;
one tanker of 32,000 tons d.w. for the Alvion Steamship Corporation of
Panama and one tanker of 24,250 tons d.w. for Messrs. Jorgen P. Jensen.
At the moment the total number of ships under construction, fitting out
or ordered exceeds 40.
Other Activities
In aircraft manufacture our capacity is well booked up for some
considerable time. One establishment has its programme of Valettas,
Varsities and Viscounts and in February, 1951, a production order was
received for our new long range jet bomber, the Vickers 660, which will
be of the first importance to the Royal Air Force; this is a major under-
taking and has necessitated heavy expenditure in our buildings and equipment.
As you will have seen in the Press the prototype made a successful first
flight on May 18.
In addition to the order from B.E.A. for the Viscount, we are now
finalising contracts with Aer Lingus and with Air France for this aircraft
and further demands are not unlikely.
Our other aircraft establishment has a full programme of Attackers and
Swifts and the aircraft section as a whole has highly important research
and development work in hand.
A new venture, the Vickers 180 industrial tractor, was commenced in
the year under review, the tractor itself being built at our Newcastle works,
with a power unit provided by Rolls-Royce; the selling arrangements are
in the hands of Jack Olding and Co., Ltd., in which organisation Vickers
have taken a financial interest. Prototypes are under trial and it is hoped
that production in quantity will start in 1952; there will also be a military
counterpart of the commercal tractor.
Our volume of exports has been large and our efforts to increase sales
in hard currency markets are bearing fruit; this is particularly marked in
the case of printing machines and paint and ink machinery. A scheme for
increasing the sale of products of Powers-Samas Accounting Machines,
Ltd., in North America is now under way.
Dividend
The dividend on the Ordinary stock for 1950, which you are asked to
approve to-day, is 12£ per cent, and as was stated in the preliminary notice
on April 19, this should be considered as a distribution of 10 per cent,
out of the year’s profits with an additional per cent, having regard to
the transfer to reserve in 1950 of supplementary dividends from subsidiary
companies amounting to £3,036,110.
Prospects
In my opening remarks I touched on the shipbuilding, aviation and
rearmament programmes which are obviously going to keep us very busy
for several years ahead; in every other section and subsidiary the order
books are full and our present capacity is at full stretch, so there is every
reason to expect a continuation or possibly an increase in our present
turnover.
It is much more difficult to calculate to what extent our operations
will be remunerative in the light of increased taxation, rising costs, the
shortage of certain raw materials and other factors; the fact that the
recommendation for the dividend for 1950 is stated in the form it is, gives
a hint that stockholders cannot automatically expect a dividend of \2\
per cent, on the 1951 results.
In the Chairman’s review some details are given of the capital expenditure
ahead of us. There is a heavy programme to be faced, but it is one which
we should be able to finance owing to the strength of our liquid resources
at the present moment.
Nevertheless, it is always possible that the crippling effect of increased
taxation and the rising cost of replacements will impose, in the long run,
a very heavy strain on our financial resources, large though they be.
The report and accounts were adopted.
GOLDSBROUGH, MORI & CO., LTD.
CHAIRMAN’S SPEECH—ANNUAL MEETING
HELD IN MELBOURNE, FRIDAY, 29th JUNE, 1951
Speaking at the Annual Meeting held in Melbourne on Friday,
June 29, Mr. K. M. Niall, Chairman, said;—
The Balance Sheet
This shows very substantial increases,
notably in debtors and Creditors, which
reflect the extraordinary price level and
seasonal conditions of the year. A con-
siderable proportion of the Creditors total
represents holdings on behalf of clients
against taxation and other requirements.
The large increase in Stocks on hand
is due in part to wool from the Company’s
own properties—the shearing and trans-
port of which were delayed by heavy
rains and floods—and partly to fencing
and building materials being imported by
our Merchandise Departments.
Profit and Loss Account
The high wool price maintained during
the year under review and the resultant
effect on the Stock Market is the main
cause of the abnormal figures recorded.
Our own Station clips were sold at very
enhanced prices and our Merchandise turn-
over and earnings also improved materi-
ally.
Although wool receipts for the year
showed a substantial increase of 26,000
bales to a total of 408,000 bales, this
latter figure does not represent a record
—a slightly higher 0ne —409,500 bales —
having been recorded in 1943-4. Wool
selling programmes were rather more pro-
tracted than in 1949-50, and we held in
store unsold at 31st March last nearly
30,000 bales more than at the same date
last year-
The number of sheep handled was
approximately the same as last year—
-5,700,00 cattle showed a marked in-
crease—from 375,000 to 500,000. A small
increase to 120,000 was recorded in pigs.
Total value of stock sold increased very
materially. The value of land sold ex-
ceeded £7,500,000.
Expenses have again increased very sub-
stantially, and there is as yet no sign of
any check in this upward trend. The de-
cision late last year in the Basic Wage
case had the effect of lifting all wage
costs to a higher level and we are only
now experiencing the cumulative effects
on the cost of goods and services.
As indicated in the Directors’ Report,
we have considered it desirable, in view
of the likely costs of the recently an-
nounced rearmament programme, to pro-
vide for taxation on a higher scale than
hitherto. You will realise also that the
rapid building up of reserves is essential
under the present inflationary conditions.
This is made very difficult by the special
tax on undistributed profits but, as we
view it, we have no option in this matter
—we must build up reserves. The tre-
mendous increase in the price of stock
has meant that much more money than
previously is tied up in financing our Stock
Agency business. Materials for building
the necessary extensions to Wool Stores
are scarce and dear, and must be largely
imported. Costs of carrying out major
extensions to stores in Melbourne, Adelr
aide and Perth, and building an entirely
new store at Newcastle, will be many
times greater than would have been the
case before the war. In spite of many
difficulties, some progress has been made
with these projects during the past year.
The Wool Marked
The season now just concluding opened
with prices 40% higher than those ruling
at the close of the preceding one, and
moved steadily upward (except for one
minor recession in October) until De-
cember. A further steep increase occurred
in January when strong U.S.A. demand
was experienced and prices rose steadily
until the Easter recess at the end of
March.
On the resumption of sales in April,
U.S.A. support was practically withdrawn
and prices fell by an average of 40%.
During May there were minor fluctuations
but in the last fortnight the market has
shown further considerable weakness. At
the peak of prices in March, wool was
averaging about £250 a bale, while
similar catalogues today would return only
half that figure.
Civilian consumer demand remained
high most of the season, but the main
fluctuations were due to the incidence of
buying for military contracts, particu-
larly on behalf of the U.S.A. The prices
paid between January and March undoubt-
edly strained the financial resources of the
trade and this, together with the present
absence of military orders, has com-
pelled the present period of re-adjustment.
Further development in connection With
synthetic fibres have been reported during
the year, including, as usual, some new
types %hich are claimed to have many of
the best features of wool. The manufac-
ture of the better-class synthetics is not
simple and any marked expansion of out-
put has been hindered by shortages of
equipment, labour and raw materials.
These are likely to be overcome in due
course and it must be recognised that
some types are likely to represent real
competitors against wool at the extremely
high "prices recently ruling.
Because of the very large amount of
money now tied up in wool during the
manufacturing process, the mills have held
their stocks at a low level, and to keep
their machinery employed must continue
to purchase. While there were very defi-
nite signs of a reduction of civilian de-
mand at the high prices recently recorded,
there is confidence in the trade that the
Australian production can be absorbed at
payable prices for a considerable period.
The Joint Organisation is now complet-
ing the disposal of the 10,407,000 bales
taken over by them in 1945, and I wish to
express appreciation of the satisfactory
result; of the assistance the Australian
Wool Realisation Commission has given
to Brokers and the Wool Trade generally
over the six-year period;
Post J. O. Wool Marketing
Scheme
The proposal to operate a Minimum
Reserve Price for wool has been for many
months the subject of negotiations be-
tween the Governments of the United
Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and
South Africa. Details of the proposals
have recently been released and are to be
voted upon by Australian Woolgrowers
shortly.
The hope of the sponsors of the plan
is that it will put a floor in the market
by the establishment each season of an
average reserve price to which prices of
all types would be related and any wool
not making the relative price in the
market would be bought in.
The capital available is to amount
to £82,500,000 (Aust.), of which
£58,750,000 would be available to buy in
Australian wool. Of this latter figure
£48,070,000 would be provided by Aus-
tralian growers, and £10,680,000 by the
U.K. Government. The Governments of
the three Dominions would also under-
take to provide on loan additional
amounts as might be necessary to buy in
further quantities of the season’s clip.
The management of the Organisation
in Australia would be in the hands of a
grower-controlled body, but the crux of
the plan is the Reserve Price. This
would be set from time to time by a
central authority incorporated in the
United Kingdom and under the control
of ten voting Directors, of whom three
would be appointed by the United King-
dom Government, one nominated by the
Australian Government and two by Aus-
tralian Grower Organisations, and two
each by New Zealand and South Africa.
As presumably one each at least of the
latter two groups would be Government
nominees. Government representation on
the central authority would be in the
majority. Apparently the strong repre-
sentation granted the United Kingdom
in relation to their commitments (they
not giving any guarantee beyond their
capital sum), is because their nominees
are considered to be representative of con-
sumers generally.
As a matter of interest, I might mention
that the capital available in relation to
Australian wools, viz., £58,750,000, is
less than the value of a season’s produc-
tion at the prices ruling under the latter
years of the appraisement scheme. In view
of the tremendous increase in costs of
production since 1945, the reserve price
would have to be set much higher than
appraisement price to provide any real
protection to growers.
The Season
Queensland: Excellent seasonal con-
ditions prevailed throughout practically
the whole of Queensland during the past
year, with severe floods in some areas due
to the abnormal rains. Although the
country generally is now carrying a good
body of dry feed, seasonal prospects are
only fair as the pasture will deteriorate
during the winter months unless good
rains are received. Recent rains have been
patchy and will not give good general
relief unless followed by further falls.
Bush fires have menaced a large area of
the State, but stock losses on this account
have not been heavy. Owing to the dry
feed carried, the fire risk is still serious.
New South Wales; This State, until
the end of 1950, experienced an excep-
tionally good season, although in parts of
the north, north-west and central west
severe floodings were experienced, causing
in some instances heavy losses of stock and
fencing. The late Summer and Autumn
were very dry and in some districts hand-
feeding had to be resorted to, and lambing
results were affected. However, good
general rains in the middle of this month
should ensure feed and water for some
time.
South Australia: In the far north of
South Australia and Northern Territory
conditions are generally excellent through-
out the cattle country. In the northern
and north-eastern districts and the West
Darling section of New South Wales con-
ditions were dry but have been consider-
ably improved by recent rains. Stock
generally are in from strong store to
forward condition. The Agricultural dis-
tricts have recently experienced wide-
spread rains.
Western Australia: With the exception
of the Kimberleys, rainfall in the Pas-
toral areas had been below normal during
the year, but recently remarkably good
rains have fallen and the outlook is ex-
cellent. The Agricultural areas are in
great heart.
Victoria: Drought conditions ex-
perienced over a long period in south-
western Victoria have recently been re-
lieved by good rains and prospects gener-
ally are more satisfactory.
Stock Markets
During the year under review, owing to
the rising wool market, sheep prices con-
tinued to improve and up to early March
extreme levels were reached, but since the
easing in the wool market and dry
Autumn conditions prices have receded to
some extent.
Cattle early In the season met with
steady demand and high prices were
obtained, but here agaiil, owing to the dry
Autumn, prices have declined.
Pests
In most districts the Blowfly was not
as severe this year as last, but, on the
other hand, the heavy rains and floods
and the rank feed encouraged worm in-
festations and this has been difficult to
deal with.
The dingo menace is still causing con-
cern in many areas, and the Noogoora
Burr has been spread widely by flood
waters and is threatening the productivity
of many districts, and, of course, causing
a serious depreciation in the value of the
wool.
Rabbits continue to be a very serious
problem, although in many areas close
to water the C.5.1.R.0. work on myxoma-
tosis has had very encouraging results.
Company’s Own Properties
During the year abnormal rains and
floods, followed by phenomenal growth of
rank feed, have created many manage-
ment problems on the properties in New
South Wales and Queensland. Lambing
has tended to be below average, due partly
to the worm infestations mentioned above.
You have already been advised that, as
a result of the Western Lands Amend-
ment Act, 1949, the tenure of the leases
of four of our properties in the Western
Division of New South Wales which, under
previous Acts, would not have expired
until 1972-78, have been made liable to
resumption at the pleasure of the New
South Wales Government. Compensation
for the loss of the leases will be com-
pletely inadequate, and, as you will
realise, when this takes effect it must
have a considerable influence on our earn-
ing power
Staff
The Directors again wish to record their
appreciation of the work of the Manage-
ment and Staff, many of whom have had
to surmount abnormal and difficult con-
ditions.
Patons and Baldwins
To take over the Australian
branch assets, business and
goodwill of the well-known
British woollen-yarn concern,
Patons and Baldwins (Austra-
lasia), Ltd., has been formed in
Victoria. The Australian busi-
ness connections date back well
into the last century, and manu-
facturing was begun in Laun-
ceston (Tas.) in 1923. Today
complete processing takes place
in this factory.
Net tangible assets of the
Australian branch totalled
£3,879,016 at April 28 last.
They included stocks, at lower
of cost or market value,
£3,377,103 ; debtors, £921,879;
cash, £1132; and land, build-
ings, plant, etc., £320,314.
Liabilities amounted to
£741,412.
Stocks, it may be noted, were
valued on April 28, when wool
prices were already down con-
siderably from their earlier peak.
Fixed assets, in the books at
£320,314, cost £831,929, and are
insured, on a replacement basis,
for £2,251,672.
The public on July 5 will be
offered 500,000 £1 ords. and
750.000 5 p.c. £1 cum. prefs.,
both lots at par. Very few of the
ords. are likely to be placed
outside the selected clients of
the sharebrokers concerned, as
the issue is not large in relation
to the demand for the shares.
To Paton and Baldwins, of
Britain, a million ords. will be
handed as part consideration,
together with £1,200,000 from
the proceeds of the public issue.
A balance of £1,679,016 will re-
main owing to the British asso-
ciate as a non-interest-bearing
loan, with a currency of 25
years (subject to the Australian
co.’s option of earlier redemp-
tion), and repayable in Aus-
tralian currency. The Australian
co., during the currency of the
loan, may not charge its assets
without die consent of the Eng-
lish concern.
On an ord. capital of
£1,500,000, and allowing for
pref. divs. on £750,000, net
earnings from the Australian
branch were the equivalent of
10.54 p.c. in 1942; 10.06 p.c.,
1943 ; 10.21 p.c., 1944 ; 5.76 p.c.,
1945; 6.51 p.c., 1946 ; 4.52 p.c.,
1947 ; 6.99 p.c., 1948 ; 8.33 p.c.,
1949; 10.73 p.c., 1950; 16.07
p.c., 1951.
Though the earning ratio for
the last term was a high one, the
prospectus emphasises that, hav-
ing regard to the desirability of
building up reserves, a conserva-
tive policy will be followed as
regards dividend distributions,
and it is not at present proposed
to pay interim divs. on the ord.
shares. After the scrip of both
classes has been converted into
stock-units application will be
made for listing.
As to net tangible backing,
the prospectus says that each of
the pref. shares, on prospectus
figures, would be “supported
by net tangible assets of
£2 18s. 8d.,” and each of the
1.500.000 ords. by 19s. 4d. It
adds; “Having regard to the fact
that fixed assets have been ac-
quired at their book values,
£320,314 (they are currently in-
sured for £2,307,730), and, tak-
ing into account goodwill and
the use of trade-marks, it is evi-
dent that the real asset cover for
preference and ordinary shares
is in excess of these figures.”
Principal products manufac-
tured by the co. are hand-knit-
ting wools marketed in Australia
and New Zealand, mending and
embroidery wools, rug wool and
yarn for manufacture into
machine-knitted goods. There
is also an ancillary trade in
knitting-needles and crochet-
hooks, stencilled and trammed
tapestry canvas and knitting
instruction-books.
The sale agreement provides
that for 25 years the Australian
co. will have the use of techni-
cal, research and advisory ser-
vices of the parent, including
secret processes and patents.
The wool-buying organisation
of the English co. will act for
the Australian offshoot. It will
charge an annual fee of £lB,OOO
a year, subject to reconsideration
after five years.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Bethune”: Bad cooking has often
been blamed for breaking-up a marriage,
but according to Dr. Joel, reputedly an
authority on problems of fertility in the
human species, dull, badly-cooked meals
have a drastic effect on male fertility and
may account for many childless
marriages. Well, I suppose the value of
Dr. Joel’s theory depends on the field
in which he has been carrying out his
research. I can’t imagine a duller diet
than that of the Eskimo, which I under-
stand consists largely of candle-ends, seal
meat and blubber, cooked, if at all, very
badly indeed. And the Eskimo birthrate
is rather low. On the other hand rice-
pudding, when it was freely available,
used to be considered the dullest dish
on the menu, yet the races which exist on
nothing but rice have the highest birth-
rates in the world. Perhaps it’s the way
they cook it. Of course, it could be that
the doctor has been misreported. After
all, dull, badly-cooked boarding-house
meals have probably been responsible for
more marriages than any other cause.

“Pip Tok”: The enterprising lady who,
wearing the uniform of an American

Korea to see her husband, a major in
the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, was
not the first woman in the history of “The
Fighting Fifth” to make a successful
masquerade. In the days when soldiers
wore pigtails and tricorne hats a girl
named Phoebe Hessell donned man’s
attire and enlisted in the regiment as a
soldier. She went through some hard
campaigning before she received a
bayonet wound in the arm at Fontenoy
in 1746. According to her monument,
which stood in the churchyard at Chelsea
—and may be there still, if it escaped the
Blitz —she was born in 1713. That would
make her 108 when she heard the Last
Post in 1821.

the States got together in 1901 there was
apparently only one which thought the
event worth commemorating by naming
a geographical feature in its honor. That
was Tasmania which, through Surveyor
T. B. Moore, called one of its finest
mountain-tops in the Arthur Range
“Federation Peak.” He is accordingly
suggesting to the P.M.G. that among the
Jubilee commemorative stamps there
should be one depicting Federation
Peak, with the figure of the man who
named it somewhere in the picture. As
the rugged mountain possesses scenic
beauty rivalling the Cradle Mountain
such a stamp would be a change from
the rather drab portraits on most of our
commemoratives.

“Waddlin’ Willie”: Mike-fright? I
invited out to dinner a friend who
is a Victorian M.L.A., and is noted in
the House for his fluent speeches and
wisecracks. Afterwards we drank our
coffee in my amateur-radio shack, and
were soon (by previous arrangement)
talking to a friend in New York City,
who also had a political friend with him.
Try as we would we could not get a
conversation between the two politicians.
Subsequently my three-year-old grabbed
the mike, and in a few minutes was
going great guns with the son of my N.Y.
friend. The two kids had known each
other over the air for almost two years.

“Kelms”: Two young abos of 15 and
17 years broke out of the Kalgoorlie
lockup and took to the bush. On police
estimates the younger lad covered 75
miles, jn bare feet, over ironstone
"If Nero gives YOU to the lions , he wants his head read."
country and rough bush, in 24
hours. His mate, putting in a
finishing burst, after a long run
just one jump ahead of the police, did the
last 22 miles in ri#o and a half hours.
That’s about the time taken by Olympic
champions in the Marathon, but they do
it on good going and not at the end of
a gruelling run. These native lads’ efforts
are good enough to suggest that a course
of training and education might fit them
for world-class sport. It’s a long way
from the native settlement to the Hel-
sinki Olympic Games, but with a little
encouragement they might make it.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
“X.S.”: It’s a wonder nobody had
previously thought of this one—or had
they? A drab-dressed man walked into
a Carlton (Melb.) men’s-wear shop, had
an ISgns. suit handed to him, was shown
into a fitting-room and left to remove his
clothing. A few minutes later a well-
dressed man walked out of the emporium,
and a few minutes after that a dazed
assistant was gazing at a cubicle empty
save for an old suit hanging on a clothes-
peg.

“Hyanlo”: One of our garage appren-
tices went to the police-station in the
shop utility to try for his driver’s licence.
He was away two hours, so the boss
wanted to know where the hell he’d been
driving to. “Well, as a matter of fact,
boss, I haven’t been driving at all. You
see, the sergeant’s missus wanted to do
some shopping so he drove her down
the town. Then we picked up his new
fridge at the station —I held it on the
back of the ute while the sarge drove
home. After installing that, we picked up
a table and chairs to take over to his
brother-in-law’s and we put them into
place there ; and then Well, anyhow,
boss, it’s just like I said. I haven’t been
driving anywhere. But the sarge says
I’m the best furniture removalist he’s
had; so he charged me fifteen-bob, and
here’s my driver’s licence.”
* * * ♦
“Harbel”: Asked a New Australian
acquaintance how he was getting on at
his job. “Oh, I am right in the soup there
now,” he said, smiling happily. It
seemed the wrong outlook, so I pursued
the matter. He’d got his expressions
mixed. He meant to say he was right in
the swim. The same chap was lament-
ing the fate of the Anti-Communist Bill.
“Ah, those judges,” he deplored. “It is
the pity that they footed the bill.” That
one really had me thinking—until I
realised that, to him, footing the bill
meant kicking it out. Still, Old Aus-
tralians make just as laughable blunders
when they get out of their normal
spheres. I once assisted at a stocktaking
in a big engineering concern. The stock-
sheet said “German Jacks 2.” All my
working life I had been indirectly associ-
ated with German jacks, but I searched
the storeroom over and over without
finding the wooden planes. Finally I
marked them off as missing. Next day
my superior asked me if I was blind.
German jacks, I learned, are also lifting
jacks—l’d lugged the wanted articles
aside five times in my search for ’em.
But I resigned after my next howler.
Sent with a truck to “get the boss
welder,” I picked up the foreman of the
welding gang and brought him in. Hang
it all, how was I to know that a “boss
welder” can also be an electrical hoot-
nanny that looks like a floor-model
radio?
♦ • • •
“E.G.G.”: Another coin that has dis-
appeared is the double-florin or four-
shilling piece, first issued in 1887. When
I worked in Sir William Arrol’s bridge-
building works at Bridgeton, Glasgow,
our pay-envelopes were made-up with
the least possible number of notes
(usually one) and coins necessary to
complete our pay. There was a “Change”
window in the pay-office for those who
wanted to break-up their pay. One Jock
used to change his into four-shilling
pieces; as he enlightened me, in a rush
in a pub there was always a chance that
one would be mistaken for a five-shilling
piece, and he’d make a shilling. He
reckoned it panned-out at least a bob a
week.
« • * ♦
“Hamer”: In the days when I was
writing stories of the underworld I knew
a character who was well-informed of its
doings and told me some queer tales.
When asked the name of any person
whose deed he mentioned, his invariable
answer was “I don’t know his name for
sure, but was the name he was
using.” A chap who must have belonged
to that circle of society appeared recently
in a Sydney court. The charge dted him
under eight aliases, attached to each of
which was a string of offences in several
States. The police were unable to tell
an inquiring Beak which was the rightful
name, though that first given was the one
by which he was best (meaning, of course,
“worst”) known. The defendant himself
said he didn’t know his right name. He
had changed his moniker so frequently
that he had completely forgotten which
was his original one.
♦ * * *
“Chips”: Was waiting to be served,
when a well-dressed lady, leading a black
poodle, blue-ribbon bow round neck,
sailed in. I stood aside and listened to
this. “How much are the tomatoes?”
“Two-and-threepence, Madam.” “Oh, I
can’t afford that. Give me a packet of
English cigarettes. How much?” “Two-
and-ten. Madam.” “Thank you.” Shop-
keeper’s comment later: “One of the
thrifty housewives.”
♦ ♦ ♦ *
“Terry the Tory”: Strange how British
people tend to hold as some of their most
precious martial memories events that,
however great the courage they evoked,
were the reverse of triumphal. Mens,
Corunna and Dunkirk —alike cases of
inadequate forces being landed on the
Continent, and then overwhelmed in
circumstances that might have been fore-
seen—have gripped the hearts of English-
men to a far greater degree than brilliant
victories such as Cr£cy, Poitiers and
Agincourt. The 200th anniversary of
Culloden, one of the worst defeats ever
suffered by Scotsmen, was celebrated in
style in 1946. Wales’s heroes are men
like Llewellyn and Owen Glendower,
who were unsuccessful, while fellow-
Welshman Henry Tudor, who fought his
way to the crown of England, has inspired
no hero-worship. ‘Even the Irish, usually
so contrary, are in step in this
matter. In 1948, when the 150th
anniversary of the 1798 Rising fell
due, a great fuss was made in Eire,
though the incident commemorated was
an inglorious affair that brought tragedy
and loss of her Parliamentary independ-
ence to Ireland, and disaster to those who
participated in it. Yet 1945 saw the
second centenary of Fontenoy—the
greatest feat of Irish arms in history—
pass without celebration . * . And then
there is Anzac!
* * * *
“F.S.”: Melbourne National Gallery
had good attendance at the Jubilee
Exhibition of Australian Art, thousands
of schoolchildren rolling up armed with
notebook and pencil and solemnly making
critical notes about the pictures. Evi-
dently the teachers of art appreciation
had told the kids what to look for, and,
having been told, naturally they found it.
Soon, no doubt, they’ll be pattering away
about “dynamic rhythm,” “color orch-
estration” and other things which have
no more to do with painting than parsing
and analysis have to do with writing.
One relevant comment was overheard,
however, from a boy who was gazing at
the aboriginal paintings, done on bark, of
male and female spirits. “I like these
the best of the lot,” he said to his mother.
“Why—they’re very primitive,” she said.
“Well, at least you can tell what sex they
are,” replied the youngster.
♦ * ♦ *
“Bo”: A peculiar complex exists
regarding motor-car doors. The man
who in his own home roars at the kids if
they slam a door instead of simply clos-
ing it will, on getting out of someone
else’s car, tense his biceps, take a strangle-
hold grip on the door-handle as if it were
a deadly personal enemy, and then try
to bash it through to the other side of
the car. Jurk, our suburb’s chief
offender, had notched about a dozen
strained doors and a couple of fractured
hinges up to the day Simmo picked him
up on his way to the station. It might
have appeared a strange gesture, for
Simmo had been one of his victims, as
had been Simmo’s two neighbors who
were in the car with him. At the station
the three passengers piled out; two of
them stood aside and slipped wink§ at
the driver. Jurk voiced hits thanks for
the lift, opened the door to its widest,
then slammed it with terrific force.
Simmo’s slipping of a section of an old
tyre into the door-jamb was a beautiful
piece of timing, and the rebound a perfect
one. We’re thinking of honoring Simmo
in suitable fashion.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
“Old Crab”: In the early days of the
war we had a training-camp c.o. who, on
manoeuvres, gave map-references for the
bivouac, with his positions for cookhouses
and the like. One of the subalterns ven-
tured : “But, Colonel, with that reference
the river is between the cookhouse and
our company.” Without batting an eyelid
the old man retorted: “You know this
is purely a training manoeuvre. Carry on
as though the river wasn’t there,’ 1
RECOGNITION.
"At the suggestion of Douglas Fairbanks, knighted
two years ago for furthering Anglo-American good re-
lations, the editor of Debrett, Mr. Cyril Hankinson,
agreed to list Americans with British knighthoods
in future; but said ‘I am drawing the line at
Americans. We cannot admit all foreigners with
British titles.' ”
Sir Douglas Fairbanks seems to think
There’s no blue-blood like printers’ ink.
For when the King had dubbed him knight
He wanted it in black and white,
And sent the mild suggestion on
Jo Mr. Cyril Hankinson:
"Dear Sir, I hope you won’t forget
To put me in your next Debrett.”
That gentleman agreed to it:
“I’U put you in, but can’t admit
All foreigners with British ranks;
In fact, I draw the line at Yanks ”
A statement which, although it lacked
The customary English tact,
Is understood to mean he’ll let
Americans invade Debrett.
Obscure knights, pardonably smug—
Sir Chester Nimitz and Sir Doug
MacArthur, Sir Ike Eisenhower,
And Sir George Marshall —bloom and flower:
“Hooray! Hooray! We’re with the Cholmon-
deleys,
The Marjoribanks, ffinches and the Bottomleys;
I>UT sun of fame will never set,
For now, at last, we’re in Debrett!”
Still, some might rank them with that fella.
The master of the Dollabella,
So tactless and so indiscreet,
Who hoped to ram the Persian fleet;
For in these days of protocol
And “after-you,” a simple soul
Can live with Richard Grenville yet.
Though separated by Debrett. *

winners. His sister shares his obsession.
The other day she walked up to a
suburban railway ticket-office and asked
for “two-bob each way Melbourne.”
♦ * * *
“Sack”: The chap in the late train
looked depressed, and perhaps I looked
sympathetic. “Been M.C.-ing a party,”
he confided. “Absolutely the last time.
Look here, people go to a party with
the special intention of being unhappy.
They sit against the wall and look glum.
Try to drag ’em into a game or a dance
and they act as if you’re trying to tor-
ture ’em. Don’t try and they’ll yawn
and tell one another what a flop it is.
If it’s a dry party the men are too stiff
and selfconscious to let their heads go,
if it’s a wet ’un they hang around the keg
and the girls howl that there are no men
to dance with —and you’re the bloke
who’s got to drag ’em away. You work
your eyeballs out to put a bit of life into
a party, you tell ’em jokes, sing a song
or two, make an unholy show of your-
self —and what happens? You hear
somebody say ‘Loves himself, doesn’t
he!’ Leave ’em alone to mope and they
tell everybody The M.C. ought to be
running a funeral,’ And to cap it all,
look at tonight. Of all the frozen-faces
and Sitting Bulls! Look, for four hours
I slaved on ’em, joking with ’em, kid-
ding to ’em—fairly begging ’em to enjoy
’emselves. And what happened? I hear
some of ’em telling the hosts at the
finish ‘Best party we ever went to—
makes all the difference when you’ve got
a jolly crowd, doesn’t it?’ ”
* ♦ • *
“Pat”: Did you know that it pays to
live on a sudden corner? Do you know
what a sudden corner is? I learned one
afternoon when a truck loaded with coke
swung off a highway and turned down a
suburban street. Coke tumbled every-
where about the area of the corner, and
while the truck lumbered on its journey
the proprietor of the comer shop dashed
out with a butter-box and proceeded to
fill it with the spillings. A crowd stood
by, watching, while he loaded four boxes
and, incidentally, cleared the road. I had
a yam with him later and discovered that
the incident was by no means without
precedent. “It’s always happenin’ on
these sudden comers. Those trucks swing
round sudden and often as not drop half
their load. Coal, bricks, tiles-nr-I got lots
o’ boxes full of ’em.”
♦ * ♦ ♦
“Irving”: The disgusted fight fan (B.
13/6/’5l) who declined Hop Harry
Stone’s invitation to mix it
was of different mettle to
a Brisbane bleacherite
whose ire was roused by a
cornerman’s dilatoriness in
standing down during
rounds, thus blocking the
view from portion of the
two-bob section. The fact
that the offending second
was billed for the main
bout the following Friday
did not prevent the enraged
two-bobber from loudly
abusing him. The corner-
man, suddenly realising
that the remarks were
meant for him, jumped
from the ring and en-
deavored to climb the net-
ting between ringside and
bleachers. I hastened to
shift my position from
proximity to the abusive
one, who inquired wither-
ingly “You’re not fright-
ened of him, are you?” I
admitted I was, and asked
“Aren’t you?” “Just
watch me,” said the loud-
mouthed one as he stood
up and made his way to
the place where the in-
censed pro, was clawing at
the wirenetting partition. The bleacher-
ite’s previous utterances were mealy-
mouthed compared to the terms with
which he proffered his hand to assist the
professional pug’s scaling manoeuvre.
Then came the anti-climax; the pro.
swiftly back-pedalled, leaving the two-
bobber triumphant.

“Derwent”: A Launceston poultry-
man got a letter from Malaya the other
day addressed to “The Hatchery that
"Look—no hands!"
Sends Chicks to Singapore, Launceston,”
The inquirer had read of a consignment
of chickens which had recently gone to
Malaya by air, but did not know the
name of the consignor. Postal alertness
placed the missive in the right letter-box,
and the prospective purchaser of chicks
got his answer in due course.

“Lucky”: When the Law walked in on
Robbie and me in the act of surround-
ing a Sunday-morning snifter at the
“local” I had resigned myself to the in-
evitable, when suddenly Robbie whooped
joyously and threw his arms around the
copper. Then it all came back. New
York and two newly-fledged sergeant-
pilots with not enough cash to enjoy the
rest-day which the R.AA.F. habitually
allowed after an eight hours’ spell of
picket duty. We hankered to see Boston.
Robbie, realising we still had our M.P,
brassards, suggested that if only we had
a prisoner the Boston trip would be easy.
Spotting a lone R.A.A.F. pilot-officer who
also seemed to be at a loose end, Robbie
put the proposition to him. Fifteen
minutes later a prisoner, whose bearing
appeared amazingly cheerful despite the
fact that he had lost his cap, all badges
of rank and was under the escort of two
fierce-looking M.Ps., was on the way to
Boston. Nobody asked us for rail
warrants going or coming back; and our
tour of Boston saloons, though yielding
up no more stragglers, the ostensible
object of our search, was far from barren.
Back in New York next day our prisoner,
who had been perfectly sober when we
“arrested” him, was genuine M.P. material
when we released him after restoration
of his cap and shoulder-badges. His con-
dition was little better when we released
him at the local last Sunday morning.
* * ♦ •
“Pawang”: A common phenomenon
of the day is the girl who reports a
circumstantial story of how she was held
up by a man with a revolver, forced into
a motor-car and taken for a ride, escaping
with her virtue intact only by a resolute
display of ingenuity and courage. One
lass so hoodwinked the police not long
back that it took them a long time to
discover the one flaw in her tale —the
shots that were fired at her. As this was
alleged to have occurred at an address
opposite a police-station and no constable
on duty had heard shots, she was dis-
believed and remanded to a girls’ home.
The psychological element in these
fantasies is generally missed by the police
investigators. They are like dreams. The
things that the fantasy-maker describes
are what her unconscious would like to
happen, but which would be quite unten-
able to her conscious thinking. A lifting
of the repression would soon break down
her story, but a policeman is hardly the
person to lift repressions.

“Ben Ari”: In W.A.’s sou’-west
the wife and I, after shaking over
leagues of corrugated road in our 7 h.p.
auto., reached a deserted - looking
lodging-house. A damsel sidled out from
behind a wood-
heap. She deigned
to converse with
my better half, but
wouldn’t have a
bar of me. Yes,
we could have a
room, but did
we have our own?
The wife looked
dazed, but said
nothing. I didn’t
get it and said so. The lass drew herself
up with the hauteur of a bedraggled
princess. “We got no staff,” she enlarged
graciously, “so you bring your own. We
got none!” “No what?” I queried.
The damsel’s face showed temper. “Gee,
some people are dumb! Yer bring yer
own grub !”
* * * *
“Lord Luvus”: “Second-coming” people
and the prophets of doom who used to
name a date for Armageddon and the
destruction of this planet appear to have
gone out of fashion. Up to a few years
ago they popped up at least once a year
in sundry places, put on the seer’s mantle
and caused terrific panic in the simple
souls of Chinamen, Russians and Ken-
tuckians by predicting the exact hour and
date of the cataclysm. Whole communi-
ties would sell their property and cluster
together to await the occasion; some
would anticipate it by committing suicide.
The recent silence of the prophets has
only one explanation, in my opinion: the
nuclear physicists have stolen their
thunder. I heard one of them in Mel-
bourne paint a more horrific picture of
the inevitability of the disintegration of
this planet than ever did a disciple of the
Second Coming. What’s more, he drew
convincing diagrams to prove it.
QUITE A STRAIN.
“These days musicians are enjoying very high
wages, but in too many of them *he epark ol
prodigality is still strong. The old practice of
borrowing from each other freely when outside sources
dry up seems as well entrenched as ever.”
—Musical magazine.
Trombonists, I fancy,
Financially chancy,
Too often may go for a slide.
The oboist’s showing
How notes he is “blowing”—
With him they but rarely abide.
The flautist while playing
Plugs holes —but, I’m saying.
Not those that occur in his wad.
The fiddler’s endeavor
Means scraping forever.
He likes it, yet doesn’t—that’s odd!
Once, they just existed.
Their breakfast consisted
Those days, of a cough and a smoke.
When flush (they’ve confided)
An egg they divided,
And who won the toss got the yolk.
Financially baffled,
They “hocked” and they raffled;
The down-beat had got them, at that.
Musicians were many—
In fact, four a penny—
They rated their calling B Flat.
But now they’re all busy.
It makes ’em quite dizzy
To think they’re so much in the dough;
Yet fivers they skittle
So well they have little,
For all their performing, to show.
They’ve debts that sky-rocket,
Big holes in the pocket,
And, aptly, they’re oft forced to “hum.”
To stave off disaster
They have to work faster;
They earn more, but aren’t worth a drum.
Nipping friends and relations
To have celebrations
Soon touches a dissonant chord.
It’s never harmonious
And far from euphonious—
In truth, it’s a habit abhorred.
So each musical brother
Must nip from the other
When monet’ry matters go dark;
Then notes have a tonic
Effect. But it’s chronic:
Their “bite” is much worse than their Bach.

ABORIGINALITIES
"Shamuseen”: It was the night of the
race ball, and guests sleeping on the long
veranda of the Mulgavifle Arms, the
town’s one-story and only pub, were
wakened by the loud and aggressive voice
of a homing reveller. A request to “break
the language down a bit” from Bill Sheep-
shanks, bunking with a wife and kids on
the floor, roused the querulous one to
new peaks in profanity. Bill, barefooted,
leapt into the street and swung a foot at
the bibulous one; a second later Bill, as
he hit the dust, made some pithy com-
ments which made the reveller’s expletives
seem mild. After all, few things will
break a toe quicker when travelling fast
and bare than connecting with a bottle
in a hip-pocket.

“8.J.C.”: Some of these duck-shooters
have been firing wildly of late in the
thick scrub around 252 George-street,
Sydney—one had a duck flying at 200
m.p.h. One doing that speed—if it were
possible—would have to be “led” at least
22£ft. at 50yds. range. That is allowing
2000 ft. per second for the muzzle-
velocity of the shot. Which it ain’t. The
average duck flies at about 20 m.p.h.,
and at 50yds. requires 3ft. to 4ft. lead.
It is rarely a duck wheels down-wind,
nd then only when someone further along
has shaken him up. Then he is going
hell-for-leather at about 500 ft. height—
too far for even a shooter’s second
barrel,
“ Yoo-hoo! Look what I made for your birthday."
“Old-timer”: The dam was 50 yards
long and the bet was whether Red Mayne
could swim it up and back while Little
Curl, Big Fleming and Jack could run
around it four times. Nobody wore any-
thing, since the dam was well out in the
scrub. Red plunged in and, head buried
in the water, surged for the far bank.
He was about half-way there when the
runners reached it, turned, gasped, and
hastily turned again and ran on into the
scrub. Red, head down and arms flail-
ing, saw nothing but the bank, which he
reached, touched, jack-knifed himself and
struck out for the return, making good
time towards the two horsewomen who
had barely glimpsed the runners as they
vanished into the scrub and who had con-
tinued down the bank, slipped off their
mounts and were standing by watching
them drink and watching the swimmer.
He reached the bank, stood up, let out
a howl of triumph. One horse reared,
the other shied; Red shook the water
from his eyes, gaped for an awful
moment, then went backwards into the
water and sank from sight. A half-
minute later he stuck his head up warily,
but by then the equestriennes had also
vanished. Presently the scrub disgorged
its secrets and Red roared, “Whinell
didn’t y’ gimme the( tip! ” “I yelled t’ y’,”
admitted Little Curl. “But be the time
the sound got out o’ me mouth I was half
a mile away, I was goin’ that fast.”

“Brid”: A most rare catch was made
recently by fishermen of St. Helens (Tas.)
—a tagged school-shark, with another
tagged fish (a flounder) inside. The shark
was among some that were given tags for
the dorsal fin and abdominal cavity about
12 months ago by C.5.1.R.0.; the
flounder was one'of 196 which officials
had tagged only two months ago. Two
other tagged sharks were caught at the
same time. Their markers indicated that
they had worn them for periods of 12,
three and two months respectively, show-
ing that apparently they preferred their
own local haunts to roaming far afield.
Last year a shark carrying a Tasmanian
tag was picked up in South Australian
waters; another tagged at Port Phillip
three years ago was caught off the north-
eastern coast of Tasmania. Measurements
disclosed that the latter had grown 18
inches during the three-year interval.

“Brick E.”: Doing a job at a small
homestead I ate with the family in the
large kitchen. On the mantelshelf stood
two clocks, one a dainty little pink thing,
the other a battered old alarum. The
latter showed quarter-to-six when we sat
down to tea; at the end of the meal I
glanced up and remarked: “Clock’s
stopped.” The boss grinned. “Aw, it
hasn’t gone for six or seven years,” he
said. It didn’t look worth keeping for
an ornament, to my eye; still, that
wasn’t my business. At breakfast neither
clock was on the shelf, but by lunch-
time both were back —and the alarum’s
hands now pointed to five o’clock. I
wondered. For the next six days the
pink one was absent every morning—
which was understandable as the mother
took it in the bedroom every night—
but the old one stayed put and showed
the same time. On the seventh morning
it was missing again. When it came back
the hands pointed to quarter-past-five.
Another six days, then a similar happen-
ing. I was vyondering whether I was
mad or they were, when I went with the
young fellow to a Saturday-night dance.
Home again, he asked me to come fish-
ing on the morrow, with an early start.
“Good,” he greeted my assent. “Then
I’ll give Mum the office.” He set the old
clock’s hands at five o’clock, tiptoed
into his mother’s bedroom, and came
back empty-handed. “Mum always
wakes early,” he explained, “But on
Sundays she goes back to sleep again—
unless I’ve left the clock there ; if I have,
she knows what time I want to be called.”

“Sackville”: My first experience of a
female boss was bought very early in life.
The lady was having chimney trouble:
“It used to draw lovely, but this winter it

smokes something terrible.” Obviously
the flue was chocked. My tender —five
bob—was accepted, on condition that re-
sults were satisfactory. I recruited an-
other boy of 14, borrowed a clothesline,
got a half-brick and cut a bushy clump of
tea-tree. The idea
was to tie the
brick-bat on the
rope, drop it down
the chimney, have
my business part-
ner attach the
bush about half-
way along the ex-
clothesline, then
I’d haul up and
he’d pull down
again until the flue
was swept clean.
By standing on tip-
toes on the very apex of the steep gable
roof I could just get my eyes over the
flue. Down went the brick, the rope was
running out well, when suddenly there
was a commotion, an eruption, a flurry
of soot; then a furred bomb exploded
in my face. I fell on one side of the
roof as the possum leapt for the other.
My frantic grab at the ridge missed by
inches. I slid downwards on my tummy,
rolled in flight, and by unbelievable good
luck halted on the brink of a 15ft. drop—
my heels having jammed down in the
gutter. With my heart still pounding
against my tonsils I was sitting there
when a reproving voice floated up from
below: “If you only got up there to
show off and act the fool, young man,
you’d better come down and I’ll get a
man to do the job! ”

“Laetitia”: I’ve known the skin-diving
binghis of the Torres Straits m.o.p.
fleets descend to 60ft. (B. 6/6/’sl)—old
Tamwoy, of Badu Island, did it regu-
larly. The ability to make such descents
is a learned and not a natural attribute,
the lungs becoming conditioned to in-
creased pressures by a staging process
over a period of years. The gruelling
apprenticeship begins while working
trochus-shell only a fathom or so down.
The learner then graduates to swim-
diving for the deeper-dwelling m.o.p.
shell. Each diver goes through a period
of excruciating headaches till the day he
rises with blood streaming from nose and
mouth after the rupture of a head-
membrane ; thereafter the headaches are
over and he is a fully-fledged m.o.p. man.
Incidentally, the Torres Straits diver
always makes a feet-first descent after
completely exhaling before he sinks like
a stone, thereby gaining valuable seconds
which would be lost in a head-first
descent.

"Mac Fergus”: There are a lot of
jokers on this C.Q. station who would
keep the übiquitous “Mat’s Mate” and
his misogynist partner on the run.
There’s a buckjump-show proprietor,
now spelling his horses, who has been
on every showground in every State —
says he finds the best riders in the capi-
tal cities. There’s a bloke here who
hoofed it from Melbourne to Bourke
and then ups and outs through the sand-
hill country and lobs here with nothing
but a pair of frayed trousers and an out-
size thirst and appetite, Watchem, the
memory-man, can quote five pages of
Robert Emmet’s speech from the dock
and follow it up with Bruce Lowe num-
bers and the pedigree of every prominent
sire in the stud-book. There’s a line-up
cove who was the come-on man in travel-
ling boxing-shows. k We have the mara-
thon long-distance liar (harmless and
humorous) of this and every other coun-
try. He never repeats himself —he can’t
—he’s too lazy to remember. The
champion bag-stacker of Australia is
here; he’s been every place in Australia
where there’s a bag of grain to toss.
There’s Dismal Dick, who checks his
overtime every evening and forgets his
late arrival on the job in the morning—
he comes from Lightning Ridge. And
there’s Bill the Dill, a vaudevillian from
Melbourne, who is no dill but operates
a betting racket every Saturday. But
just to keep Mat and his mate away from
the joint we have Irma, chefess, rising
28 and a curvaceous nine stone, but, any-
how, neither Mat nor his mate would be
in the race. The bloke keeps a blue
heeler and a .32 always loaded.

“Gravelsnatcher”: Duck-shooters at
Bremmer Bay, on W.A.’s south coast,
between Albany and Esperance, are not
only assured of good sport, despite that
a gunshot will send countless thousands
of black cockatoos screeching into the
air, but get plenty of oil which will yield
a not-too-strong light. It bubbles out of
the earth; apparently coming in a
natural flow through a crack in the
earth’s crust from Freney, on the north
coast, where a search for oil is now
going on.

“H.A.L.”: Interesting light has been
thrown on the antiquity of aboriginal
occupation of Australia by a discovery
made in the north-west of S.A. by F. J.
Hall, R. G. McGowan and G. F, Gulek-
sen. On flat slabs of sandstone in the
bed of a creek, and on the rock walls,
they found very ancient aboriginal carv-
ings, representing the tracks of giant
flightless birds measuring up to 15m.
across the spread of the toes. Fossil
remains show that Australia did have
two species of giant birds similar to the
moa of New Zealand; one has been
named Genyornis newtoni and the other
Pachyornis queenslandice. When making
rock carvings of animal tracks the abo-
rigines usually made them life-size, so
the inference is that thousands of years
ago the ancestors of our present abo-
rigines knew these birds as living
creatures. If this was an isolated case
it would merely serve as the basis for an
interesting theory; but there are several
parallels which tend to confirm it. Near
Yunta the late Dr. Basedow found similar
rock sculptures representing life-sized
tracks which could be only those of the
extinct diprotodon, and in the South
Australian Museum is a rock carving of
a crocodile head which was found in the
Flinders Ranges. Ethnologists hope to
find aboriginal remains associated with
food fragments which will show that the
first human inhabitants of this continent
hunted the diprotodon and the “big-
fella emu” mentioned in the legends of
the tribes of Western Victoria, In the
Devon Downs rock shelter on the lower
Murray the bones of the Tasmanian devil
were found among abo. food refuse —and
it is many a long day since that creature
lived on the mainlands
THE DROVER.
The drover steadied his horse’s pace,
Then stopped, and wiping his dusty face
He looked at me with a gloomy eye,
And said, “I’m blest if I know why
I ever took on to cattle.
“Ever since I was a bit of a kid.
Axe-handle high to a billy-lid,
I’ve tagged along on this drovin’ job
And rolled me swag with many a mob
Of travel-weary cattle;
“With water bad, and a ‘babbling-brook’
Who turns good tucker to grub that’s crook;
And your drovin’ men are as myall blacks,
They lose a wing, and then lose their tracks
Amidst the wild scrub cattle.
“This drovin’ job in the Territory
Is not what it is cracked up to be,
So I think I’U give the game away,
And break new tracks where you’re not all day
Behind a mob of cattle.”
But when I said, “What’s on next year?”
He gave me a strange, incredulous stare;
Yanked at his feeding horse’s bead,
Spat at a fly, rode off as he said:
“I’m liftin’ a mob of cattle.”

dependants in addition to the Life Saving Drugs
already provided. Each pensioner must present his
or her Medical Service Entitlement Card to the doc-
tor, who will write two copies of the prescription
for the patient to take to any authorised pharmacy
which will be dispensed without charge to the
pensioner.
This means that age, invalid, widow, blind, tuber-
culosis and service pensioners, and their depend-
ants under the age of 16 years, are now entitled to ;
(a) Medical Treatment and
(b) Special Pharmaceutical Benefits
in addition to Life Saving Drugs.
Those who have not obtained their Medical Service
Entitlement cards should make immediate appli-

“John S.”; It isn’t a question that may
be addressed to one’s favorite maestro
of a soap radio-quiz, so perhaps some
other goatherd may tell me if all billy-
goats, or, for that matter, belle-goats, are
water-shy. My neighbor, Persimmon,
anchors a hummer in his apple vineyard
to keep the blackberries in check. To
my knowledge, during his two months’
occupancy of the holding, Adolph has not
consumed one drop of water neat. More-
over, the appearance of the slightest
drizzle sets him bleating like the bull of
Bashan until he’s untethered, when, with
mincing steps, he wends his way, avoiding
puddles of water, to his pen. Whether it
rains for a day or a week he refuses to
budge from his kennel while it’s raining,
and his dry rations and quota of jam-tin
labels are stowed away without the aid
of any lubricant. Maybe that’s why he
hums, but is he a freak or just a goat?

recent floods were anxiously watching

thing large and bulky caught in the

been dropped for them from a plane
when they were similarly cut off by flood
waters three years ago. Still edible was
the powdered milk, which they took with

“Nailii”: The classic example of re-
maining immune to gold-rush fever (B.
13/6/’5l) was that of Jimmy Caulfield,
a stockman on Widgee station, near
Gympie (Q.), in 1867. On the run Caul-
field met a prospector, from whom he
learned that signs were promising;
the unusually communicative fossicker
showed the stockman colors he had
"Isn't it lovely to be in your own place at last!”
located. It was some three weeks before
Caulfield got back to Widgee head-station
and casually reported the conversation.
Simultaneously the news reached Widgee
that the stranger, James Nash, had dis-
covered on the run the bonanza Gympie
Reef, which was to save the newly-
separated State of Queensland from
bankruptcy at a stage when there was
exactly Is. 9d. in the Treasury. Asked
why he had not joined Nash in the search
when the signs were so promising, Caul-
field replied “I was paid to muster Wid-
gee stock and not to go chasing gold.”

“Mat’s Mate”: In the Border Inn at
Moama they were talking about fish, and
old Harry Jointer said something about a
“bull-nosed” cod he caught near the Peri-
coota Landing. This started a lot of
skiting about “spotted” cod, “green” cod,
“white-bellied” cod and so forth, and
somebody weighed in with the old furphy
about the scene of its death being etched
on a cod’s diaphragm. We listened and
drank and listened and drank, until the
inevitable tales started coming up about
big ones caught here and there. Then
Mat put down his empty pot and asserted
himself. “You fellers want t’ get down
on the Goulbum,” he said. “Around
Murchison an’ them places. That’s
where y’ get the garter cod. Best damn*
fish of the lot.” There was a brief silence,
then someone asked, “What’s a garter
cod?” “Y* can’t beat ’em,” Mat said.
“They call ’em garters because y’ can
stretch ’em t’ any length when y’re talkin’
about ’em.” The stricken silence lasted
until the publican meekly asked if we’d
all have the same again.

“B. A. Ker”: The crows were in-
terested in something near the small patch
of ripe corn. In relays they sat on the
fence-posts or made an occasional poor
imitation of a wagtail-hover over the
thistles near the crop. But the quarry
was evidently too alert to warrant the
short dive to earth. A hawk came float-
ing on the strong wind. A brown except
for a greyish-white patch near the tail,
he was slightly bigger than the crows.
He wheeled over the spot, hovered,
dropped to about 25ft., hovered again,
wings vibrating with that short pulsating
movement peculiar to hawks, but did not
make the deadweight drop-dive of the
smaller hawks. Instead he sailed away
on the wind —and came straight back,
low to the ground, wide wings extended
in a way that reminded me of a kite pull-
ing against a string. For a few seconds
he was out of sight; when he rose an
object hung from his talons, its four legs
and long tail hanging limp. Investiga-
tion showed chewed cobs of corn —and
proved my guess: bush rats. For several
hours the crows maintained their tactics
without success, then the hawk volplaned
back. He repeated his former manoeuvres
and again rose with a rat. But before he
had gained 3ft. of altitude a black
hijacker swooped from a post. The
attack stopped short —the hawk had
wheeled to face the enemy. But he was
carrying weight, the attacker was circling,
and more enemies were charging in. He
landed to fight it out. There was no
fight. The Kellies feinted and abused,
but didn’t mix it. Disgust in his action,
the hawk took off and drifted away on
the wind. An escaped rat lived to ruin
more com.

after a century of missionary zeal in the

old boy’s bones and give them a damned
good hiding; after which Grandpa is
supposed to rest in peace and his
descendant to make a rapid recovery.

ADDITIONS
KOREAN PEACE MOVE.
An important result of the
MacArthur inquiry (as reviewed
by “New York Times”) is that
out of the disputatious mass
there h,as “fortunately emerged
a far clearer picture of American
policy” than had hitherto been
set forth. Its points constitute
the general American position in
regard to the Soviet “offer” of
“peace talks” on Korea:
(1) The U.S. would continue
to limit the war in Korea by
avoiding courses of action in
which the calculated risk ap-
peared too great, but would not
abandon Korea to Communist
aggression, and would keep the
door open to a negotiated cease-
fire.
(2) The U.S., however, will
not make the reward of aggres-
sion a condition of negotiations,
will oppose the transfer of For-
mosa to the Chinese Com-
munists and will likewise op-
pose its conquest by force.
(3) Similarly, the U.S. will
oppose the admission of the
Chinese Communists to the
United Nations even to the ex-
tent of carrying the veto issue
to the World Court if that is
necewary.
(4) The U.S. will continue to
seek by political means the
establishment of a free, demo-
cratic and united Korea.
(5) Wi?J continue to recognise
and & assist the Nationalist
Government of China and will
continue to deny recognition to
the Chinese Communists.
(6) Will continue to oppose
the spread of Communist im-
perialism by aid to those who
resist it, and will urge and pro-
mote the denial of strategic
materials to the aggressor.
(7) Will recognise the strategic
importance of Hong Kong and
oppose its fall into Communist
imperialist hands,
(8) Will continue to exert
efforts for the conclusion of a
speedy and generous peace for
Japan.
The stand the U.S. would be
likely to take if the Soviet move
came to anything has been
further elucidated by the “New
York Times”:
“A Korean peace must be
made for Korea, not for the
political advantage of the
Chinese Communists.
“The long-range political
objective in Korea is a free,
united, democratic nation. This,
presumably, is to take in the
entire peninsula. The United
Nations undertook to supervise
elections in as much of Korea
as would be open to its represen-
tatives. That objective has not
been changed
“On the other hand, the
United Nations has not made a
commitment to unify all of
Korea by military measures. In
contrast to the Soviet planning,
the United Nations wants a
Government of free choice and
not of imposition. Conse-
quently, there is wide feeling in
the United Nations that military
operations can be brought to a
conclusion at some points south
of the Yalu boundary without
any loss of integrity. This does
not, and should not, mean that
there would be any retreat from
the proclaimed objective of a
free, unified, democratic Korea.
It would mean, however, that
the means for bringing this
about would move from the
military into the political field.
“Such a programme,” the
authoritative New York paper
added, “will entail continuing
obligations upon the United
Nations and its members. Obvi-
ously, a free Korea will have to
be defended and the Koreans
themselves must be strengthened
to the point that recurrent
aggressive adventures will be dis-
couraged, If the Korean out-
post of democracy could not be
overrun in June, 1950, it can-
not be exposed to subsequent
overrunning whenever it suits the
Communist imperialists to the
north and west.”
All of which, if adhered to,
would seem to signpost very
rocky going on the way to an
agreed peace.
France’s New Spirit.
For France, a London “Time
and Tide” correspondent has
pointed out, war seemed till
recently to mean the certainty of
swift Russian occupation:
“This prospect was terrible
enough, but it was made more
so because a Russian occupation
would automatically carry the
French Communist party into
power. And all Frenchmen
familiar with this party and its
methods know that, once in
power, it would proceed to ex-
terminate the elite of the French
nation.
“It was these not unreasonable
fears that helped to intensify
defeatism in France and to en-
courage the Communists. It also
swelled the ranks of those who,
although not Communists, saw
safety in attaching themselves to
the Communist cause.”
Now, however, the correspon-
dent discerns a new spirit abroad
in the land. “There is a distinct
improvement in the temper and
determination of France. The
time has gone when it was pos-
sible to anticipate, in the event
of war, an immediate seizure of
power by the French Communist
party and the collapse of organ-
ised resistance.”
To which may be added the
equally favorable finding of staff
writer in the Paris edition of
New York “Herald Tribune”:
“The best-informed French and
non-French political observers
in Paris now report that French
neutralism is dead and that
France, apart from its Commu-
nist minority, is a solid part of
the Atlantic community.”
Another “Herald Tribune”
(Paris) writer, noting that it is
the fate of French politics to win
more headlines for crises than
for progress, records on the
credit side these achievements:
(1) The prosecution of France’s
own four-and-a-half-year-old war
against Communism in Indo-
China; (2) initiative leading to
the establishment of the Council
of Europe, the first experiment
with a continental Parliament
with its seat at Strasbourg; (3) a
leading hand in the development
of the five-nation Western Union
treaty now absorbed by the
Atlantic pact; (4) successful en-
counters with the great Com-
munist-led strikes of 1947 and
1948 ; (5) laws against threatened
Communist sabotage of the re-
armament effort.
Reviewing the recent elec-
tions, London “Times” noted
“one cause for satisfaction”:

weakened in the Assembly, and
anti-Communism is now stronger
in France than at any time since
the war. “The Communists,” it
added, “are likely to be an
obstinate and irreconcilable force
for a long time to come, but
they no longer have the power
they had.”
De Valera.
London “Times’s” editorial
welcome-home to the Irish
leader:
“In British eyes, Mr. De
Valera returns, if not exactly as
an old friend, at any rate as a
statesman whose sincerity and
integrity are beyond question.
“He is the embodiment of the
Irish revolution. He has stood,
in peace and in civil and world
war, as the architect and
champion of national inde-
pedence for the thirty-two
counties. His worst enemy
must agree that he overshadows
in prestige all his living
countrymen.
“He has never, in his relations
with Britain or with the North
of Ireland, bitter though they
have often been, ceased to make
clear that—once he had his way
over sovereignty—he desired
friendship; and he can count on
reciprocity of goodwill from
this country.
“A subtle mathematical mind,
a refusal to compromise even to
avoid bloodshed, have not ob-
scured the stature of the new
Taoisearch. The most puzzling
aspect of his complex philosophy
is, for those outside Southern
Ireland, the manner in which he
reconciles hatred of pagan Com-
munism with avoidance of
sharing in the European and
American burden of Christian
and democratic defence. The
paradox is common to most
Irish politicians.”
The “Times” expects De
Valera will need “all his long
experience of office in difficult
circumstances” to stay in the
job, though for the present the
Independents on whose support
he depends would not like to
face a fresh election.
Formosa.
In addressing Congress
General MacArthur was
emphatic:
“Under no circumstances
must Formosa fall into Com-
munist control. Such an even-
tuality would at once threaten
the freedom of the Philippines
and the loss of Japan, and might
well force our western frontier
back to the coast of California,
Oregon and Washington,”
However, according to “Man-
chester Guardian,” “The highest
British military opinion, based
exclusively on military con-
siderations, is known to be
contrary. It is that the Ameri-
cans could conduct from
Okinawa and North Luzon all
the operations' needed for the
security of MacArthur’s island
chain.”
Even so, the “Guardian”
believes there are good, non-
military reasons for holding on:
“The Peking Government has
shown itself aggressive, terrorist,
a danger to the world and per-
haps as paranoiac as Hitler. In
negotiation with a Power of this
sort nothing can be given for
nothing. Our bargaining-
counters are all too few :
Formosa is one. If the part of
the Cairo and Potsdam declara-
tions which refers to Formosa
is !o be implemented, the
minimum we should ask in
exchange is that the other parts
of the declaration—referring to
the independence of Korea—
should also be implemented.”

Aid For Chinese Generals. —Cryptic
comment by London “Financial
Times”: “Chinese generals are as bad
now as ever they were in the war
against Japan. But this congenital
failing in their leaders should prove
no handicap to the Chinese armies.
They can rely on the politicians in
London, Washington and Lake Suc-
cess to make Jheir opportunities for
them.”
* * * *
French Doubts. —In the British and
U.S. Press there has been a good deal
of doubting of the French as prospec
tive fighting allies. “But,” a London
“Observer” writer says, “to get a
fair picture of the French state of
mind we should realise that the ques-
tion ‘Can we trust them?’ is not
merely asked by us about the French.
It is also asked by the French about
ourselves and the Americans. While
we remember 1940 for the collapse of
France and the Vichy treason, many
Frenchmen remember it for the with-
drawal of the British Army from the
Continent, leaving them to face the
German Army almost unsupported.”
« * « *
Most Popular Radio Fare. —In the
U.S., reports New York “Herald
Tribune” radio critic John Crosby,
“The most popular type of radio
programme year in, year out, is news.
News programmes are listened to
more extensively try more Americans
than any other type of programme.”
* * * *
Too Much Economics. —ln the
British “National Provincial Bank
Review," Kenneth Pickthorn, M.P.,
contends that economics have played
too large a part in politics these last
50 years. For this he blames both
politicians and economists. The worst
crime of both, he thinks, was telling
“the majority of a nation at war that
they are going to be the better off for
it economically afterwards.” He com-
ments: “We are being impoverished
more by refusing to recognise that we
have been [impoverished] than by the
fact itself.”
♦ * * *
Excluded Turks. —On Turkey’s in-
creasing requests to be included in
the North Atlantic Treaty, a London
“Sunday Times” writer points out
that, on the one hand, if Russia
attacked a North Atlantic Treaty
Power, all the other Treaty Powers
must declare war on her, but, on the
other, if Russia attacked Turkey,
neither Britain nor the United States
would be bound to declare war. They
would doubtless send military, air
and naval aid to the victim, as they
have to South Korea, but, as in the
Korean case, they might try to con-
fine the fighting to the victim’s teiri-
tory: “Wherever that alternative to
world war remains open, there will be
strong arguments for taking it. But
they are not the victim’s arguments.
For the victim the course followed in
Korea may well be thought the least
desirable of all.” The same argument
-holds good for Greece.

J. Bull in Africa. —“Honest men
exist who deplore what Britain has
done in Africa,” comments a London
“Observer” correspondent, adding:
“They do not accuse their country
of exploitation or cruelty, but rather
of thrusting the Africans forward into
unhappiness, into a new society where
they will find other and harder
masters. It is certainly possible to
claim that in advancing these people
politically, neither the contentment of
the majority nor the poor man’s
chance of security and justice will be
increased.”

Turks "Ready’’. —Summing-up in a
London “Fortnightly” article on
Turkey today: “After years of con-
tinuous Communist provocation the
Turks have philosophically accommo-
dated themselves to their ‘armed
truce,’ ready to accept any sacrifice
for national security. Once supplied
with adequate quantities of arms and
equipment Turkey could mobilise
more than 40 divisions. The fighting
qualities of the Turkish soldier are by
now common knowledge In a
world of collective insecurity the one-
time ‘sick man of Europe’ is doing
remarkably well.”

BERT.
Dogology.
“What! Deadlegs on a heavy track? Not a hope !"
I first saw the fellow —he and
his wife had taken a flat in our
block a few days before—when
he came downstairs as I was
brushing the dog.
“Giving the dog a bit of a
brush-up, eh?” he remarked.
Now, there are two kinds of
individuals who particularly
irritate me: one is the chap
who repeats like a parrot the last
few words of your sentence",
the other makes the obvious and
redundant remark.
1 looked up. “On the con-
trary,” I replied evenly, “You
observe me designing a stained-
glass window.”
This shaft apparently fell
blunted from his hide, for he
looked closer and said “Isn’t
that a wire brush you’re using?”
“Well,” I replied pleasantly,
“I don’t think even an Eskimo
could mistake it for a whitewash
brush.”
“Rather severe on the dog’s
coat, isn’t it?”
“It’s a wire-haired dog,” I
replied frigidly. “What more
natural than to use a wire brush
on it. It stimulates the hair-
follicles much as a massage does
to the human scalp. It is, in
fact, exactly what a winter coat
needs.”
He departed then without
another word, and he seemed
thoughtful, possibly considering
the soundness of my bold
theories. His own meagre
knowledge, I didn’t doubt,
had sprung from skimming
through a few books on dogs,
such as I had been imprudent
enough to buy. The man who
has the ability to experiment
has no need of such musty
ideas.
Agapanthus and I had been
given the dog by a friend who
assured us it had, on one side
at least, a formidable pedigree.
Muncher was rather long and
underslung on the principle of
a dachshund, with hindlegs simi-
lar to a greyhound’s, a tail that
curled cutely over its back and
long shaggy ears. But it was
the striking shape of its head
which had attracted me—some-
thing between a cantaloup and a
nutmeg-grater, an attribute, ac-
cording to my friend, of excel-
lent breeding. Agapanthus in-
sisted that we enter it in the dog
show that was being held soon
in the district, and I was giving
it preliminary preparation.
A few mornings later he hap-
pened to be passing as I was
syringing out the dog’s ears. He
rushed over.
“Don’t do that,” he pleaded.
“You’ll risk your dog getting
canker in the ears if you wet
them inside.”
"Hooey! ” I replied. “A dog’s
ears, if you take the trouble to
look inside one for the first time
some day, are, you’ll find, built
on much the same lines as ours
—various ponvolutions, and
hairs in diem to catch germs
and dust from getting into the
lungs. I’ve had my own
syringed out several times for
wax, and I haven’t noticed that
my lugs have rotted off yet.
Muncher, here, is, I think, get-
ting waxed-up, so what more
logical than to give him the
same treatment? What do you
expect a man to do —treat him
like a Washington navel that is
infested with wax-scale and
spray him with white-oil and
washing-soda?”
He regarded me silently for a
few moments, as he had done
before, before departing. I was
convinced that I was revolution-
ising what few sketchy ideas he
had gathered on how to get a
dog up to concert-pitch, as it
were.
On the Saturday morning
when he came downstairs I was
giving Muncher a bath. I had
put some kerosene in the water
—I do that with the final rub-
over of the car, which imparts
quite a lustre, and I could see
no reason why it shouldn’t give
a sheen also to the dog’s coat —
and was scrubbing away when
my fellow-flatite looked first
astounded, then angry.
“That’s over the odds I” he
exclaimed. “Using sandsoap on
a dog. Don’t you know they
have tender skins? It would be
to him like it would to you
being rubbed-down with a
brick.”
“Well,” I replied crushingly,
“I often rub down with a brick
after a cold shower in winter—
my pores, I find, get incalcul-
able benefit from it. There’s
nothing wrong with sandsoap—
it’s pure, isn’t it? And I hold
the theory that it smothers fleas
better than any other kind. Any-
way,” I went, on, for I was get-
ting thoroughly fed-up with his
buttings in, “Mr. Knowall, or
whoever you are, I don’t think
you could tell the difference oe»
tween a Saint Bernard and a
miniature Peke unless one of
’em had a small barrel of
brandy slung under its neck.”
I could feel Agapanthus, who
had just then come out, tugging
agitatedly at the back of my
shirt. The poor woman hates
scences.
“And just keep your bib
out of things you know nothing
about,” I went on, keeping a
tight rein on my temper,
“You’ve probably learnt all
about the care of dogs from a
profound study of Mrs. Beeton’s
Cookery Book and the railway
timetable. Now, mizzle off —
I’m busy.”
The fellow hurried off, trying
to look dignified. It was Aga-
panthus who cut in.
“You fool!” she hissed. “I’ve
just met his wife. He’s the
author of one of the books on
dogs you bought, and he’s to be
the judge at our dog show!”
Bo
Emphatic.
“My answer’s no ! So grab

And then slink back to where

How can Sturt’s desert pea be
grown in Sydney suburban gardens ?
This native trailing plant ( Clianthus
dampierii) requires careful handling.
It needs dry conditions, and there
must be no manure or fertiliser in
the soil. Leave the plants severely
alone after they germinate. Results
are often obtained by soaking the
seed in hot water for ten minutes
before sowing and then burning
leaves, grass or brambles over the
bed, the ashes supplying potash.

How did Parliamentary reports get
the name of “Hansard’'’ ?
Luke Hansard, who was born in
England in 1752, acquired, in 1800,
the business of printer to the House
of Commons; he printed the
journals of the House from 1774
till his death in 1828. His son,
Thomas Hansard, began in 1803 to
print Parliamentary debates, which
were at first taken from newspaper
reports. In 1899 the debates were
published by the Hansard Publishing
Union, Limited.
* * * *
Do the sun’s rays come in a direct
straight line to the earth ?
Only when the sun is directly over-
head. At all other times the rays
follow a straight path to the top of
the earth’s atmosphere and are then
refracted in a curved path to the
earth’s surface. The amount of
refraction depends on the inclination
of the sun to the vertical, and is
greatest when the sun is nearest the
horizon. Einstein’s Relativity Theory
implies that space is curved, but the
amount of curvature due to this is
infinitesimal as between sun and earth.

What is wrong with a dog that
walks with his head cocked so that
one ear is lower than the other, is
continually shaking his head as if
trying to dislodge something from its
ear ?
This is a case of otorrhoea, com-
monly misnamed ear canker, and is
caused either by the presence of wax,
dirt and water in the ear, or, possibly,
eczema. Apply with a camel-hair
brush a solution of 1 drachm of
oxide of zinc ointment and loz.
almond oil, as far down the canal of
the ear as possible. Next day clean
out the ears with some medicated
wool twisted around a bodkin or a
manicure stick; repeat the first opera-
tion immediately after cleaning. This
treatment should be continued for a
week in order to effect a cure. But
follow instructions carefully in order
not to perforate the ear-drum.
* * * jJ;
A method of treating canvas
veranda-blinds so as to protect them
from the weather?
Soak the material in a hot soap
solution (3oz. soap to each gallon of
water). Drain off excess liquid and
immerse, before dry, in a copper sul-
phate solution (Boz. copper sulphate
to each gallon water) for several
hours. Iron or galvanised vessels
must not be used as containers. The
process both rot-proofs and water-
proofs canvas. It will turn the
material a very pale green.
* * * *
A method of waterproofing con-
crete ?
First ensure a clean surface by
removing all oil- and grease-stains
and all dust and loose material. When
water is used, ample time must be
allowed to permit thorough drying
before waterproofing is started. Next
apply two coats of linseed-oil. The
first coat should consist of equal
parts of raw linseed-oil and turpentine
heated to a temperature of 175 deg.
F., applied with an ordinary paint-
brush and allowed 24 hours to dry.
Best results are obtained if atmo-
spheric pressure is above 65deg. After
this first coat has set, spots where
the concrete is most porous will
become evident; these should be spot-
treated with the hot mixture and
allowed to set before continuing. The
second coat, applied in the same
manner as the first, should consist of
undiluted raw linseed-oil heated to
175 deg. When this coat is dry, paint
the surface with any approved con-
crete paint. If turpentine is unavail-
able turpentine substitute can be used,
as its purpose is to act as a thinner
to assist penetration. Care should be
taken when heating, as turpentine and
its substitutes are inflammable.
* * * ♦
What qualifications are necessary
before a town in N. S. Wales can be
proclaimed a city ?
A city may be declared to be so
under the Crown Lands Consolida-
tion Act, 1913, by proclamation or
notification by the Governor or a
Minister in the Government Gazette.
It must have had during the five years
preceding this proclamation (1) an
average population of at least 15,000
persons, and (2) an average gross
income of at least £20,000. It must
be an independent centre of popula-
tion and not a suburb —whether resi-
dential, industrial, commercial or
maritime —of any other municipality
or centre of population. The City of
Parramatta was constituted by special
legislation in 1938.
Brief Answers.
V.C.: Cannot determine value with-
out inspection. Suggest you submit
to a reputable art-dealer R.M.A.:
Dust the surface of the furniture,
then apply a clean rag dipped in raw
linseed-oil and rolled into a pad. Rub
well in, covering every part of sur-
face, then rub with second rag and
finally polish well. Two applica-
tions may be necessary C.D.: (1)
Depends upon the variety of useful
honey flora in the locality, standard
of breeding maintained and com-
petency of management. (2) The
N.S.W. Department of Agriculture’s
publication Bees and Honey, 2s. 9d.,
post paid T.L.; First soak the
line in raw linseed-oil for one week.
Then hang up to dry, taking care to
prevent it from being exposed to the
sun. Treat with best-quality marine-
varnish or solpah-oil, wipe off sur-
plus varnish and leave until a thin
skin has dried on the line... .RJ.F.i
Cyanogas (calcium cyanide in the dust
form) is blown through passages of
the warren by means of hand pumps.
On contact with air fatal hydro-
cyanide gas is given off. As dust
emerges from the warren the exits
are blocked to insure retention of the
gas within... .A.W.: To renovate a
leather coat remove all stains by going
over entire surface with saddle-soap,
wiping off soiled soap as you go.
Repeat process R.M.A.: To soften
shoe-leather rub warm neatsfoot-oil
well in with a cloth. Two good rub-
bings should be enough...
Wallabies are protected in N.S.W.
under the Birds and Animals Act,
and may be taken or killed only
during an open season or under a

SUNDRY SHOWS
Royal Art Society.
Nobody would dream of
representing Wordsworth in an
anthology of poetry by one of
the flat or merely average pas-
sages from “The Prelude,” exer-
cises in perseverance or crafts-
manship falling short of his full
majestic power ; and yet in the
N. S. Wales Royal Art Society’s
Jubilee exhibition at Anthony
Hordern’s, as in the Common-
Jubilee show discussed
on the “Plain English” page in
this issue, no real attempt has
been made to represent Gruner
and Norman Lindsay at their
best.
The Royal Art’s Gruner, a
flat, chalky seapiece, has none
of the subtlety and poetry that
make Gruner supreme in Aus-
tralian landscape; and the
Norman Lindsay watercolor,
though well enough, is hardly
more than the sort of technical
exercise Norman Lindsay
throws off by the dozen while
preparing himself for his occa-
sional transcendent masterpieces.
But the Royal Art show, made
up of past and present paintings,
does do much to fill up some of
the gaps at the National Gal-
lery. Phil May, John Flannagan
and Squire Morgan, for instance,
are represented in the black-and-
white section. The watercolors,
rather a dull lot so far as the
new work goes, are lit by a de-
lightful Eldershaw, a scene of
boats and blue sky much more
spirited than most of his recent
work, and by a magnificent
Penleigh Boyd with a glittering
sky over a dark, matted hillside
which one would have expected
to find in a Blamire Young
rather than in a Boyd.
Lance Solomon gets a hear-
ing among the oil-painters here
with a vigorous canvas of a red
road winding through tall,
ragged bush. There is a Law-
son Balfour, glowing with
color; an unexpectedly deep
and rich little Salvana; a mare
and foal by Frank Mahony; a
fine ploughing landscape by
Harry Garlick ; a Heysen oil of
the Flinders Range; some of
Septimus Power’s horses ; an ad-
mirable nude by J. S. Watkins;
Mary Edwards’s golden water-
color of the queen of the
banksias ; a typical Lister Lister.
And also, adding to the interest
of the exhibition as a supplement
to the National Gallery show,
there is an unusual portrait by
Streeton, a bush scene with
goats by Lambert, and Tom
Roberts’s immortal “Prawns.”
New work on view includes
Robert Johnson, Sherman, James
Jackson and Erik Langker in
good form; a pleasant Gallop
of sunlit gum-trees; a clear,
crisp flowerpiece by Margaret
Coen; and a Chinese woman
against a gold screen by Roland
Strasser, an exceptionally attrac-
tive painting in a light, decora-
tive way,
Kenneth Macqueen.
Fifteen or 20 years ago
Kenneth Macqueen’s water-
colors, with their flat bright
patterns, probably seemed
daringly modern ; now, though
the style remains highly distinc-
tive, we have grown accustomed
to them and his show at Sydney
Grosvenor Galleries is no more
startling than his show of three
years ago.
The paintings are none the
worse, and none the better, for
that; only they serve to point
the moral on the one hand that
it is a mistake to be too easily
startled by a new expression in
art and on the other hand that
art does not depend on its
immediate sensational quality
for survival but on its intrinsic
artistry: technique and vision.
Kenneth Macqueen’s artistry
has always been of a high
order; clear, bold, confident,
the watercolor washes handled
with certainty and crispness;
and his present show, if memory
doesn’t deceive, is a good deal
more forceful than his last.
His paintings may be placed
in two categories: those which
are merely decorative patterns
and' which leave the present
commentator rather cold; and
those in which the moods of
nature, though never quite
naturalistically depicted, are
represented in striking images,
sometimes dramatic, sometimes
lyrical. The second kind of
paintings outweigh, if they don’t
outnumber, the first in the
present exhibition; and, in par-
ticular, “Nocturne,” “Evening
from My Window,” “Bush
Gaiety,” “Seaward from Moffatt
Head,” “Approaching Storm”
and “Surf and Sun” are not only
decorative but alive.
A minor but pleasing point is
that Macqueen’s kangaroos, as
in “Belar and Brigalow Scrub,”
instead of being horribly self-
conscious, as kangaroos in most
paintings are, fit quietly into the
watercolors as into their natural
habitat.
Sydney Group.
Among the mainly experi-
mental paintings of the Sydney
Group at David Jones’s Gallery
the soundest are those of
Donald Friend and Desiderius
Orban—Orban’s “The Docks,
Balmain,” dark green and mas-
sive, is a murky statement he
had made many times before,
always with some force.
The liveliest are those of
Arthur Boyd, whose drawing is
childish and whose oil and
tempera make an unpleasantly
shiny surface; but who retains
his ability to suggest a wild and
menacing landscape. The effect
of his “Expulsion,” in which an
angel that would have surprised
Milton whips a Stone Age Eve
from the Garden, is of childish,
or perhaps adolescent, savagery.
Otherwise, except for John
Passmore’s “Bathers” and some
nice blues in Michael Kmit’s
paintings, the work lacks fresh-
ness. Francis Lymburner, of
course, has talent, but his
frivolity seems to become in-
creasingly empty; Russell Drys-
dale is cumbrous and gloomy in
a study of decaying bricks; and
James Gleeson’s large surrealist
offering—he is at his best in
very small oils —is as rococo as
it is familiar.
The exhibition tails off into
the abstract paintings of Grace
Crowley and Ralph Balson and
some empty bottles by Paul
Haefliger.
Moomba.
It is rather a chastening re-
flection that the original pro-
prietors of this country, who
were forgotten in the initial
plans for the Jubilee celebra-
tions, ended-up by providing
one of the most artistic contri-
butions. What’s more, they did
it on their own, or at least under
the inspiration of aboriginal
pastor Doug Nicholls.
Under Nicholls’s direction the
warriors and the hunters, the
lubras and the piccaninnies were
assembled from as far away as
North Queensland and Oodna-
datta, and as near as Fitzroy,
and were put on the stage at the
Princess, Melbourne, to do a
moomba.
What a moomba is present
commentator doesn’t know, but
it was a remarkably good show.
The players were under the
supervision of white producer
Irene Mitchell and script-writer
Jean Campbell, who did a good
job, too, in that their hands
were nowhere apparent.
The only trace of Western
culture was in the address
of Pastor Nicholls. But
then he withdrew from the
microphone and, minus his sac
suit, with Harold Blair minus his
fish-and-chips and with actor
William Onus minus his Euro-
pean trousers, reappeared with
his fellow-tribesmen while they
enacted a day in the life of the
Stone Age man against a back-
ground of rock and desert.
The story concerned the re-
turn to the tribe of chieftain
Toolaba’s son Birwain with his
totemic bride. They tell the ex-
periences of their journey, the
tribesmen enact them, and there
follows song, dance and feasting
—witchety-grubs, snakes and
goannas. Then they settle down
to rest, the sky darkens, then the
dawn comes and a woman is
found sleeping where, under
tribal law, she should not. She
is whacked and the husband
fights his rival, the tribe takes
sides, and, after being given a
sufficient time to express their
feelings, the tribesmen are
roared into peace by the gigantic
chieftain and the husband drags
off his wailing lubra.
It was all done with the
utmost simplicity, with a
rhythm and a naturalness of
acting and a quality of miming
which put it in an entirely dif-
ferent class from the Australian
ballet on the same subject done
recently on the same stage.
There was a variety in the
monotony of the chanting and
the dancing of these primitive
folk, instead of the monotony
which their European imitators
get into the variety of theirs.
Even -the piccaninnies and the
lubras seemed natural actors,
and some of the folk-songs were
extraordinarily lovely.
Marjorie Lawrence sang her
swan-song to her home State at
Melbourne Town Hall with a
repetition of her magnificent
performance of Briinnhilde’s
invocation to the gods over the
dead body of her husband, and
would have followed it with her
favorite ditty, “My Ain Folk,”
but the orchestra wouldn’t let
her, not having had a rehearsal.
Miss Lawrence retaliated by
paying it the handsomest tribute
ever handed to a band of players
by a visiting artist. She said
that she wanted to speak of the
pleasantest memory she would
carry away from Australia, and
the audience stuck its chest out,
expecting the usual compli-
mentary references to its sym-
pathy, appreciation and powers
of discrimination. Miss Law-
rence, however, was referring to
the magnificent performance of
the orchestra, especially in the
“Electra.” It might have
sounded like mere politeness if
the singer hadn’t obviously
meant it and if the orchestra,
plus conductors Goossens and
Michael Bowles, hadn’t as
obviously deserved it.

Cathleen O’Carroll already
has the essentials for fulfilment
of the fine promise she showed
at her Sydney farewell recital
before going abroad for further
study. She has a clean attack,
facile fingering and bowing, a
feeling for the particular work
she is playing and obviously high
musical intelligence, nowhere
better demonstrated than in her
playing of the Cesar Franck
Sonata. Here she achieved a
nice lyrical flow, with a mel-
low broadness investing the
low - string work. Vitalii’s
“Chaconne” was given in grace-
ful style befitting the period.
Joan Sutherland, George
Humphrey and Gladys Hart
were the assisting artists, the
first-named being in splendid
voice.

One of Australia’s five big mutual life
offices, the 77 - year - old Colonial
writes ordinary, industrial and accident
and sickness contracts throughout the
Commonwealth, New Zealand, South
Africa and Britain, Soundness and
encouraging progress in all sections are
the features of the latest accounts. New
business and total income both reached
record figures, bonus-rates were main-
tained on an even keel, the basis of
valuation in the O.D. was further
strengthened, a better rate of interest was
earned on mean funds, the bigger busi-
ness was handled at less cost, and there
have been changes in the investment port-
folio designed to strengthen future earn-
ing capacity.
New business figures for the two life
departments compare as follows;
Ordinary. Industrial. Total.
1949 .. £31,661,381 £6,738,133 £37,399,514
1950 .. 36,469.993 5,842,624 42,312,617
Of last year’s total (up £10,913,103) over
86 p.c, was ordinary, the average amount
per policy being £1416 as against £1298
for 1949 and £6BB for 1943. Behind
the buoyancy lies the inflationary boom,
a rapidly-expanding population, quick
growth of group and industrial-super-
annuation insurance and home-purchases
associated with life cover.
In the three departments combined the
year’s total income was £12,111,791 (up
£1,271,082), of which £9,728,298 (up
£1,008,642) was premiums, etc., and
£2,383,493 (up £262,440) interest, divi-
dends and rents. Claims, which were well
within actuarial expectation, took
£4,316,220 and exes. £2,051,131, while
£152,721 was written off the book-value
of assets, thus strengthening inner
reserves, and £40,000 was sent to the staff
fund. The £5,588,719 that remained was
added to the life and accident funds,
raising them to £62,099,631, of which
£52,098,449 belonged to the ordinary,
£9,581,156 to the industrial and
£420,026 to the accident departments. In
addition there were contingency and
other reserves totalling £1,047,542, which
also belong to policyholders, there being
no shareholders.
The surplus available for distribution
(excess of assurance funds over liabilities
under policies) increased in the industrial
and accident sections:
1947. 1948. 1949. 1950.
Surplus— £ £ £ £
Ordinary .. 937,018 1,026,231 1,203,974 *

Total .. 1,120,953 1,231.868 1,428,628 *
* Not yet available.
Owing to additional work involved in
changeover from a mixed 3-2 i p.c. to
stringent 2\ p.c. basis of valuation, the
exact surplus in the O.D. had not been
arrived at when the accounts were sent
out. An approximate valuation, how-
ever, showed that the amount will be
ample for maintenance of reversionary
bonuses on the same satisfactory scale
as for the previous year. The whole idea
behind a low basis of valuation is to
strengthen the protection for policy-
holders and preserve future bonus-paying
capacity.
Excluding taxes, exes, took 15.3 p.c.
of the O.D. premiums as against 15.9
p.c. in 1949. In the I.D. the ratios were
29.7 p.c. and 30.6 p.c. respectively—a
heartening achievement considering the
rise in wage-rates and large amount of
new business written. Mechanisation of
routine office accounting was a major
factor in the improvement.
The net rate of interest earned (after
deducting taxes) on the mean funds of
the three departments combined was
£3 16s. 4d. p.c. (up 2s. 2d. p.c.), which
is comfortably in excess of the 2\ p.c.
the actuary now assumes that the funds
in both life departments will earn.
The improvement in net interest earn-
ings followed changes in the investment
portfolio:

some of which have lately fallen to a
discount in the market, were reduced by
£2,350,909.

Outstanding features of the table are
the resilience of net earnings and lifts
in the div. since 1943. Certainly turn-
over —it ranges from hardware and
furniture to women’s fashion lines with
an optical department thrown in—has
been carried from one record to another
on the rising tide of a sustained infla-
tionary boom and an expanding economy.
Other contributing factors have been
careful budgeting (which means good
buying and a tight hold upon controllable
outgoings), a steady strengthening of
the financial structure (much of the
increased turnover has been financed out
of surplus earnings and provisions), and
constant brightening of the store and
improvement of shopping facilities. And
the co.’s woollen mills at Mascot and its
workrooms have helped to swell earn-
ings, too.
With wage and all other costs advanc-
ing at an alarming rate, and gross
margins on controlled lines diminishing,
retail profits have become increasingly a
function of turnover. According to the
Government statistician, the increase in
aggregate sales of Sydney’s principal
retail stores was 16.8 p.c. for 1950, 6.8
p.c. for 1949 and 16.3 p.c. for 1948. The
comparatively small increase in 1949 was
more than offset by the effects of spiral-
ling costs and the official slimming of
gross margins ; hence the slip of £8193
in Foy’s declared profit for that year.
The co. doesn’t broadcast its turnover,
but, after allowing a generous £39,972
(up £2538) for depreciation, there was a
leap of £239,969 in last term’s gross
earnings:
1948. 1949. 1950 1951.
Gross ~ £728,026 £802,623 £819,332 £1,094,899

Net .. £123,910 £136,547 £128,354 £152,212
Exes. —they included something for taxa-
tion and £14,000 (same as previous year)
sent to the staff fund —made off with
£216,111 of the gain. The net result was
thus £23,858 stronger at a record
£152,212, which covered the 6 p.c. pref.
div. (£16,374) and 25.1 p.c. on the
£540,367 of ord. capital as against 20.7,
22.2, 19.9, 15.9 and 13.2 p.c. back to
1946. And shareholders joined in the
prosperity, the distribution being lifted
from 13| p.c. to 15 p.c., of which 2\ p.c.
was labelled bonus. Average distribution
over the last eight years was 12.5 p.c.,
compared with an average of 6.6 p.c. for
the eight years before that. The five
years to 1935 were dry ones. The
£54,782 of the year’s net earnings that
remained lifted the visible lay-by to
£469,771, and inner reserves are “fully
adequate to meet any reasonably pre-
dictable contingency,” the chairman says.
Finances are comfortable:

To carry an extra £181,344 of stocks (due
largely to the rise in prices for wool and
cotton) and add £76,215 to book debts
the co. went to its bankers for £123,692
and increased the amount coming to
sundry creditors, etc., by £19,052 last
term. Stocks, the dominant feature of
the accounts, appear less a “substantial”
reserve against market fluctuations. The
improvement in the more-or-less liquid
surplus (£464,728) was £47,799.
Turnover has remained on the up-grade
since the close of accounts, and so have
wages, costs and prices. Pending legisla-
tion relating to long-service leave
threatens to further bump-up costs, and
some increase in co. and other taxation
can be expected. The whole background,
however, is very fluid, and it is difficult
to say at the moment whether turnover
will continue to increase sufficiently to
offset the effects of mounting costs for
the whole of the current term.
Among other things, the market notes
the wide margin between earnings and
distributions, and prices the pound ords.

Alert and enterprising management,
American technology and a hungry and
sheltered market are among the factors
behind the quick and profitable develop-
ment of this plastics manufacturing co.,
which continues to increase the volume
and range of its products and to widen
the field of its interests and activities. It
kicked off in June, 1948, when it took
over the then three-year-old plastic
moulding business established by H. T.
Piercy and J. Ashwood. The public be-
came interested a year later, when 40,000
£1 shares were issued at a premium of
10s. each, lifting paid capital to £115,000.
The figure had grown to £301,000 in
100,000 £1 5 p.c. prefs. (taken by City
Mutual Life) and 804,000 ss. ords. at end
1950, and has increased since.
The factory at Chatswood, near Sydney,
is a new building bought for £27,501 in
March, 1949, and is equipped with its
own electric-generating plant. A second
floor is now being added, and additional
premises are going up alongside, which
together will give the co. an extra 18,000
square feet of floor space. Output has
grown from toys, combs and utility lines
to the requirements of other industries,
such as radio cabinets, gramophone
records, refrigerator crispers, instruments
panels, escutcheons and a variety of
custom mouldings.
The co. also holds a controlling interest
in Piercy and Ashwood (Distributors)
Pty.—lo,ool £1 shares bought for £36,000
(in scrip) in June, 1950. It is entitled to
the first £16,000 of each year’s profit and
to participate equally with the other 9999
shares in net earnings of the proprietary
until June, 1953; thereafter all share in
the proprietary rank pari passu. The
first £16,000, which has been received
out of profits earned prior to acquisition
of the scrip, has been used (less £2OOO
income tax) to write down the purchase
price of the shares. Another subsidiary
is Standard Tool Co. (Aust.) Pty., whose
turnover is reported to be expanding
rapidly.
Sales have increased as quickly as plant
could be installed, raw materials imported
and products turned out. After eliminat-
ing outside shareholders’ interests and
allowing for depreciation and taxation,
profit for the year to June 30, 1950, was
£50,377, or 40.3 p.c. on average capital.
For the six months to end 1950, net
earnings were at the rate of £73,682 p.a.,
or enough to cover a full year’s pref.
div. and 35.1 p.c. on ord. capital as it
stood at Dec. 31 last. So the \2\ p.c.
distribution was a comfortable matter.
Output and sales have expanded since
the close of accounts.

Stocks were built up partly as a hedge
against rising prices and scarcity of raw
materials, especially cellulose acetate.
Following the close of accounts 18,000
f.-p. ss. shares were exchanged for 4497
£1 shares held by outsiders in subsidiaries,
and £20,100 of bonus scrip was scattered,
one for ten, mainly from the share pre-
mium reserve. Then, at April 30, those
on the ord. register were offered 328,800
new ss. ords. at par, two for five. When
all the money is in, paid capital will be
£407,800 in 100,000 £1 5 p.c. prefs. and
1,231,200 ss. ords. The pref. div. and
\2\ p.c. to the ords. will then call for
£43,475, or less than 60 p.c. of the annual
rate of net earnings during the last half
of 1950.
Now a new jointly-owned co. is to be
formed in conjunction with Louis Marks
and Co., U.S.A., to supervise production
and distribution of Marks plastic pro-
ducts in Australia —first of these are now
being moulded in Pierwood’s factory.
Also the Australian and New Zealand
rights to precision casting of a stainless-
steel product, known as “stancasting,”
have been acquired from the Standard
Tool Co., U.S.A. And another agreement

C.S.R. Co.’s Report
Chairman advises record sales of refined
sugar, 100,000 tons above pre-war deliveries
C.S.R. sales of refined sugar, golden
syrup and treacle in Australia during the
year constituted a record, Mr. E. R.
Knox, Chairman of Directors, told a
meeting of Colonial Sugar Refining
Company shareholders on 13th June.
Deliveries of refined sugar
were 18,500 tons more than
the year before, Mr. Knox
said, but the Australian de-
mand was still not satisfied.
Production losses for the
year were 70,000 tons,
amounting to .15% of the
capacity of the refining
plant. Causes of this heavy
loss were:
• Labour inexperienced
and in short supply.
• Coal poor quality and
irregular deliveries,
• Blackouts.
• Raw Sugar Deteriora-
tion due to slow shipment
of the sugar from the
tropics.
.
• Industrial stoppage of
seven weeks at Adelaide
Refinery.
Plant Capacity
Adequate
The margin between
the present mechanical
capacity of O.S.R. re-
fining plant and current
production is substan-
tial.
The temporary inability
to meet demand is not,
therefore, a question of
plant capacity.
Plant Developments
In Hand
Our average sales of
refined sugar in recent
years have exceeded
pre-war levels by over
100,000 tons a year.
But with a continuously
increasing population and a
reduced working week, we
are not relaxing our efforts
to extend our plant capac-
ity to meet increased de-
mands in the future.
Capital expenditure on
our Australian refineries in-
curred recently and planned
for the next few years
amounts to £si million.
Slow supplies of steel and
labour are retarding this
programme.
But despite these handi-
caps, considerable progress
has been made. For ex-
ample, the mechanical capac-
ity of our Melbourne Re-
finery has recently been
raised from a level of 3,000
tons a week to 3,500 tons.
New Power
Stations
We are spending £2 mil-
lion for boiler and power
stations, made necessary by
the poor quality of the coal
we have been compelled to
use. A high pressure boiler
and two turbo-alternators,
ordered nearly five years
ago, should be in use at
our Pyrtnont factories in
Sydney soon. This plant
will reduce the electricity
load on Sydney’s generating
system by an amount suffi-
cient to supply 700 homes.
Australian Sugar
Still Cheap
Australian refined
sugar is still cheaper
than in most of the
principal countries of
the world. The price
in Canada and the
United States is more
than twice the current
Australian price.
Costs of farm and fac-
tory wages and materials,
tractors, fuel, fertiliser, jute
packages, land and sea
transport, coal, plant re-
placement, etc., have all
risen so steeply in Austra-
lia that the farmers and
millers of the raw sugar
industry are being forced
to seek an increase in the
home consumption price of
sugar.
U.K, Govt, Officials
Disregard Obligations
The U.K. and Cana-
dian sugar negotiations
with Cuba have dealt
a grievous blow at
the principle of Im-
perial Preference. Prob-
ably the most serious
aspect is that the United
Kingdom Government
has not lived up to its
obligations under exist-
ing agreements to safe-
guard Commonwealth
markets for Common-
wealth exporters.
df
RAW SUGAR
Floods in cane
growing districts
prevented farmers from har-
vesting the record crop ex-
pected. Total production of
35 Australian raw sugar
mills (including the Com-
pany’s seven mills) was
897,000 tons, slightly less
than the 909,000 tons record
established the previous year.
In Fiji, too, exceedingly
unfavourable weather ad-
versely affected the cane
crop.
REFINED
SUGAR
Shortages of
refined sugar are
liable to recur in several
States unless the labour
supply and fuel position
considerably improve in the
next few months.
v
Housewives Get
Preference in
Sugar Deliveries
Manufacturers should
consult the C.S.R. or their
usual sugar supplier before
undertaking any expansion
programme which would
result in increased use of
refined sugar. We should
not be expected to direct
refined sugar away from
the grocery trade and
housewives to enable manu-
facturers to expand or start
new businesses. The re-
sponsible Australian authori-
ties consulted agree with
this policy.
DISTILLERY
PRODUCTS
Sales of Indus-
trial alcohol from
our two distilleries were
the highest since the war.
Recently, however, we have
been unable to meet the full
demand, mainly as a result
of transport difficulties. Sales
of CO 2 , both liquid and
solid, constituted a record.
gdf
BUILDING
MATERIALS
Our two
newest pro-
ducts, Asphalt Floor Tiles
and Asbestos Cement Sid-
ings, are now well estab-
lished on the market. There
has also been a marked in-
crease in sales of Cane-ite
Acousti-Tiles.
Production of building
boards was hampered by
shortages of coal and pub-
lic electricity, and Govern-
ment rail truck restrictions.
The use of blue asbestos
fibre from our mines in
Western Australia enabled
our subsidiary Asbestos
Products Pty. Ltd. to estab-
lish a production record for
Asbestos Cement sheets.

CHEMICALS
There is a
world-wide
shortage of plastic mould-
ing powder. The Austra-
lian demand for CelSioß
moulding powder far ex-
ceeds the production of
C.S.R. Chemicals Ltd. The
supply of raw material is
our limiting factor at pre-
sent.

national Plastic Moulds Pty.
with a capital of £lOO,OOO. The
new co. will take over some of
the equipment and processes of
both pierwood and Plastic
Moulders.
The immediate outlook for
the plastics industry in Aus-
tralia is bright enough. Long-
term prospects will largely de-
pend upon what happens in con-
nection with competition from
both local and overseas sources,
including Japan, Germany and
Italy. The market prices the

The formation of a new tin-
dredging co. by Alluvial Gold
(a Sydney-controlled holding
and prospecting concern) to
work 1054 acres of alluvial tin-
bearing ground, known as the
Battle-Nettle Creek areas, be-
tween Ravenshoe and Mt.
Garnet, on the Atherton Table-
land (N.Q.), is still held-up by
failure of the Queensland Gov-
ernment to issue titles to the
leases. The delay is due to no
informality or irregularity on
the part of the co., but to a
pending amendment of the
Mining Act, under which regu-
lations are to be issued fixing
the conditions for working the
area. Disposal of the dredge
effluent appears to be the
problem on which the Govern-
ment is unable to make up its
mind. The co. says that, prior
to completion of purchase of the
leases from Australian Iron and
Steel, the terms and conditions
to be attached to them were
fixed by the Government, The
ground, check-bored at a cost
of about £4OOO, is estimated to
contain 31,000,000 c.y. of 10.50 z.
to., assaying 72 p.c. metallic
tin. Total amount payable to
the vendor is £40,000. It is pro-
posed to dig the ground with
Barrytown Gold Dredging’s
2,500,000-c.y.-p.a. bucket-dredge,
which has been dismantled,
crated and transferred from
Barrytown to a site near the
wharf at Greymouth (N.Z.)
ready for shipment. Meanwhile,
the proposed new co. has missed
the peak of the tin market, and
the Federal Minister for Supply
has talked about tax concessions
to encourage production of
much-needed tin ore in Aus-
tralia.

ings, which are expected to

“Cyanide”: Shareholders in
many Australian mining
ventures are getting a very poor
return for directors’ stipends,
Excepting the Barrier mines at
Broken Hill and some others
whose reports are commendably
informative, most mining direc-
torates seem to divulge as
little useful information with
as much delay as possible
to shareholders. When any
“hole -in - the - ground” is still
in the prospecting stage, with
share hawks playing the market
on the strength of day-to-day
developments, such reticence by
directors immediately becomes
suspect. Indeed, legislation is
long overdue to deal with this
matter in the interests of all
who speculate in an endeavor to
develop the mineral resources of
our Commonwealth.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
In spite of the rain quite a sizeable
group of people turned up at Christy’s
to see the fashion parade held in aid
of Ricky Doherty’s princess candidature
for the Food for Babies Fund. The girls
modelled furs by Cornelius and hats from
William Beale, worn with their own
dresses and accessories from Prouds.
The furs showed the trend towards ver-
satility—stoles that allegedly can be worn
24 different ways, skirted boleros that
turned out to be coats and collars too,
Scotch mole dyed sapphire-blue, etc.
The hats, well made and designed, were
still of the “shock tactics” type, and rather
too sophisticated for the young girls who
modelled them. Some spectacular jewel-
lery was worn on the back of the collar,
a new idea designed to make one as
interesting when going as coming,
apparently. The girls who did the model-
ling were Ricky herself, Pat Blacklock,
Noreen Flannery, Shirley Gray, Brenda
Williams and Carmen Young.
Wearing glasses has become quite a
fashion, even with those who don’t really
need them, but it’s not always done to
the best effect. When spectacles really
are spectacular they should be worn with
plain clothes. One of the models at the
Ricky Doherty parade wore a cute pair
with blue-and-white-striped rims, but
spoiled the effect by adding a dramatic
hat, a wire-fence veil and a fur collar.
All this gave her a very much over-
furnished face.
Young Audrey Nicholls, aged 17, from
Townsville (Q.), won the £5OO Frances
Scully dancing scholarship, for which
eight girls competed, last week. Audrey
has been a member of the Borovansky
company for their Melbourne and Syd-
ney seasons, and she will go to England
to study further at the end of the year.
When she danced the polka from
“Facade” in the competition she wore a
red satin costume of the vivandiere type,
with which Mr. Borovansky (one of the
judges) expressed great dissatisfaction.
The other judges were Miss Eileen
Brennan and Mr. Harald Bowden. The
money for this scholarship has been
raised by pupils of the Frances Scully
school in memory of their teacher, who
died early this year. They hope to be
able to offer it every two years.
Just a word of sympathy to Joan
Osborne, who was ill and couldn’t com-
pete for this scholarship. She also is a
member of the Boro company, and was
seen as Red Riding Hood in “Aurora’s
Wedding” and the little boy in “Boutique
Fantasque.”
An unusual little exhibition was held
at the Empire Theatre during the week
of paintings based on the Borovansky
ballet. About sixty works were shown
by Dora Jarret (pronounced in the French
manner, please), Elsa Russell and Piers
Bourke. Dorothy Stevenson opened the
show with a charming little speech in
which she said that the presence of the
artists had been quite a feature of
rehearsals and that their water-colors and
sketches captured moments of the ballet
which would otherwise be vanished and
forgotten. The company has now gone
to Brisbane, leaving quite a blank in
Sydney’s social life.
At the Liberal convention last week
Mrs. D. W. Rae caused an uproar when
she said that she “objected to the soften-
ing of Australians,” and that the modern
mother was “not a mother’s bootlace.”
Of course, if Mrs. Rae meant
“softening-up,” the Australian mother
couldn’t agree with her more, for to be
softened-up is to be harassed and dis-
tressed until one feels that one cannot
face such fearful odds.
It will be interesting to see what effect
the new abstract sculptures have on Syd-
ney children —that is, of course, if the
City Council finally decides to put them
into the parks for playgrounds. Their
sponsors and creators, Lyndon Dadswell
and Anita Aarons, claim that they stimu-
late play of an imaginative nature, are
exciting to the eye and fit in with the
surroundings in a way that statues of
Shakspeare, Captain Cook and Matthew
Flinders never could. The children can
explore all the surfaces, slide down them,
crawl into them, sit in them pretending
to be castaways or something, and
generally come to know as much about
them as there is to be known. Doubtless
they’ll dream about them, too. It is pos-
sible, of course, that the children will
also come to regard these shapes as the
right ones (perhaps they are), and that
when they grow up they’ll scrap all our
familiar furniture and design spherical
pianos, lopsided stoves and chairs with
their feet in the air.
“The Merchant of Venice” at the
Independent played for its first few nights
to a rather waterlogged audience and the
accompaniment of torrential rain on the
roof, which must have been dispiriting
for the players. The Independent now
serves its interval-coffee in the room
upstairs, which is more spacious than the
foyer and could be the setting for quite
pleasant inter-act conversation. Gillian
and Walter Bunning came along on the
opening night, also Jennifer Hocking,
who does some good work in the printing
of textiles for costumes, and artist Francis
Lymburner, whose dressing of the play
was interesting and a little curious.
Gillian Bunning is understudying the part
of Portia, and may have a chance of
playing it later in the season.
The committee of the Black-and-White
Ball to be held on October 2 is already
well ahead with its plans. It is hoped to
make the Trocadero look like a small part
of Paris for the night, with boutiques
and flower-stalls and whatnot. The prizes
sound as though they are to be as glamor-
ous as ever this year: a white nylon
nightgown valued at 14 guineas, a dress
from Pellier, a blouse from Rocher, a
model hat, a handbag donated by Mrs.
R. McCaughey. Someone suggested that
along with these in the boutique should
go certain other things, valuable today—
a pound of salt, a packet of matches, a
bunch of onions, a pound of butter, etc.
There was an instant reaction against this
idea at the last committee-meeting, how-
ever, for the 8.-and-W. Ball is perhaps
the most glamorous of the whole season
and to intrude the sordid searchings for
the means of keeping body and soul
together these days seems rather out of
keeping. On the other hand, if these
commodities were offered for their amuse-
ment value, people would think that fun
was being made of too serious a subject.
Miss Roberta Sinclair Reid was
awarded the M.B.E. in the King’s Birth-
day honors-list for the splendid work she
has done for the blind over a period of
many years. Miss Reid was formerly at
the Darlington institution, and then head-
mistress of the Wahroonga school for the
blind. It was she who taught Alice
Chapman, Australia’s Helen Keller, who
was blind and deaf from birth. The
training started when Mrs. Chapman was
an infant, and she is now a woman of
many interests with correspondents all
over the world, a keen mind and an
ability to produce knitting and other
handwork that many people with their
sight could not emulate. Miss Reid
thinks that it was mainly her work with
this pupil which brought her the recent
honor from the King. Photo by Norton

The best-selling title among new books
is surely The Art of Being a Woman by
Amabel Ellis, for the women will buy
it to see if they can pick up a few hints,
and the men in the hope of finding out
just a bit about what makes women tick.
Judging by the reviews, both will be a
little disappointed. It is apparently full
of serious-minded facts, figures and
statistics, and doesn’t give you any idea
of how, for instance, you are to go out
in the morning suitably dressed for
lunch, shopping, dinner with friends and
a dance, nor what is the best color lip-
stick to wear with beige. It seems to
emphasise mainly the necessity for women
to develop their personalities and minds
so that they can lead a full life, but this
goes just as well for men, too, doesn’t
it?
From Melbourne
The true gala atmosphere pervaded
the Town Hall at the first Yehudi
Menuhin concert, attended by the
Governor and Lady Brooks, she
in a gold-tissue rose - embroidered
draped gown worn under a blue-
fox wrap. Anne Spraggett’s pretty
gown of white organza had three
deep black-edged frills at the hem of the
slim skirt. Mrs. Tail’s titian coloring
was set off with a gown and jacket-stole
of sea-green velvet. Mrs. Yehudi
Menuhin’s full-length mink coat covered
a gown of black net which had a wide
panel of lime-green net at the back of
the skirt. She was with Hephzibah
Menuhin (Mrs. Lindsay Nicholas), who
also wore mink, her gown being
of black Chantilly lace over white
taffeta. Other members of a distinguished
audience included Lady Knox, who was
with her daughter-in-law Mrs. John
Knox ; Mrs. Harold Rabling, whose mink
jacket covered a black gown; Madame
M. Vigano, her short black moire taffeta
gown having a large bow at one side of
the skirt; her daughter, Mrs. Don
O’Donnell, in black floral moire and
Persian-lamb jacket; the Rubery
Bennetts, of Sydney, who were with Mr.
and Mrs. C. Sedon Thompson; Jill
Daveron, her black-crepe-and-lace gown
featuring the harem skirt; and Mrs.
Claude Kingston, who was with the
Frank Martins.
Vivacious Betty Perry, wife of U.S.
Naval Attache Commander Adrian
Perry and mother of two-year-old
Adrian, is a honey-blonde with blue eyes
and was one of last year’s 10 best-
dressed women of Melbourne. With her
husband, Mrs. Perry came here in 1949
and became one of the leaders in the
American colony. She is always in de-
mand as a mannequin for charity shows,
and will be missed when in early Sep-
tember she leaves for Washington, via
England. Commander Perry goes to a
new post.
President of Y.W.C.A., Mrs. T, C.
Rentoul, Miss Meysie Law and Mrs.
Simon Warrender, president of the
concert committee, received the Governor,
Sir Dallas Brooks, Lady Brooks and their
daughter Jeanette at the Town Hall
concert organised to raise funds for the
Y.W.C.A. Appeal. Anne Spraggett was
also in the vice-regal party. The
Governor’s lady wore tea-rose pink moire
under a blue-fox cape. Jeanette’s
bouffant frock of bronze-and-wine-shot
taffeta had a band of heavy tucking
edging the hemline. An unusual jacket
of white Persian-lamb was worn over a
gown of white cloque by Mrs.
Warrender. Her mother, Mrs. G. Myer,
wore a three-quarter-length jacket of
silver mink over her short black evening
frock. A black-fringed scarlet stole,
decorated with groups of black bobbles,
covered the white chiffons worn by Mrs.
Ross Shelmerdine. Lady Clarke’s draped
chiffon gown was dove-grey. Peter
Dawson, John Amadio, Glenda Raymond
and Eunice Garland were the artists.
Glenda’s white chiffon gown was worn
over a pale-pink underskirt, the white
lace bodice encrusted with sequins and
paillettes. Eunice’s turquoise-blue satins
were strapless, and had motifs of deep-
rose sequins embroidered on bodice and
overskirt.
Dr. Jeanne Eder, here at the invitation
of the Federal Government for the
Jubilee celebrations, was guest-of-honor
at a party at the Town Hall given by
the Lady Mayoress, Lady Disney, who
wore a tailored suit of persimmon-red
wool and a swathed toque of white silk
jersey. Dr. Eder, who comes from Zurich,
in Switzerland, was in black Persian-lamb
jacket, black frock and wine-red felt hat.
Among the guests were Senator Ivy Wedg-
wood, Mrs. Claude Couchman, Mrs. John
Cain, Myra Roper (head of the University
Women’s College), Lady Dixon, Lady
Wales, Mesdames F. Hardy, Bernard
Evans and Burns Campbell, Dame Mary
Daly, and Mrs., F. Baton, wife of the
Vice-Chancellor of the University.
Glamorous slumber-wear brought rap-
turous sighs at the fashion parade in the
Julius Kayser showrooms in Flinders
Way. Based on model gowns seen in
the fashion-centres of New York, Lon-
don and Paris, some of them would
almost do as ball-gowns with a slip
worn underneath. Apart from a few
luxury garments of nylon, the prices of
most are within the business-girl’s
budget. Very new was the pretty imita-
tion petit-point work seen on the draped
shoulder-line of one nightgown, and also
the use of lovely French laces as trim-
ming. Nylon frilling is used to finish
hip-slips and those of ballerina length.
In this new collection of lingerie, slips
have been cut to give a slim hip-line, a
soft, raised bust and fullness at the hem.
Also new and very pretty is the camisole-
slip with a full, gathered top finished
with ribbon-threaded lace, and strapless
slips made with elasticised tops. Popular
shades were flamingo, bluebell, butter-
cup and willow. One luxury nightgown,
cut on classical lines, was of white all-
over embroidered nylon. Another, a sheer
nylon in pale-pearl grey, had embroidered
medallions in nylon thread scattered over
the full skirt; although it measured nine
yards round the hem, the whole garment
weighed only B^oz.
November 8 is the date chosen by the
organisers for the Navy Bail at Earl’s
Court, St. Kilda. Proceeds will go to the
fund for the chapel building at Flinders
Naval Depot. The senior Naval chaplain,
Rev. W. H. Henderson, and Commodore
H. J. Buchanan, who is chairman of the
chapel committee and organiser of the
ball, were at the first meeting. Last year
£9OOO was collected for the chapel, and
it is hoped that this year there will be
sufficient raised to complete it. Lady
Disney and Lady Collins are patronesses,
Mrs. Buchanan is again president of the
ball committee and vice-presidents are
Mesdames R, R. Dowling, Wallace
Mitchell, Lionel Grimwade and W. H.
Cowper, and Miss Ella Payne. In
arranging entertainment Mrs. Eric Cottrell
will have the help of her sister, Mrs.
Norman Spry. In charge of decorations
are Mrs. J. Plunkett-Cole and Mrs. F. R.
James.
The engagement is announced of
Robert, elder son of Captain and Mrs.
Gordon Chirnside of Carranballac,
Skipton, to Judith, daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. W. Armstrong, of Argyll, Shep-
parton. Robert, who was educated at
Geelong Grammar, saw service with the
A.I.F, in the last war, Judy also did
her bit with the W.R.A.N.S. On July 10
at the home of Robert’s sister and
brother-in-law, the Reshid Beys, an
engagement party, which will also be a
farewell to Russell Chirnside, who sails
in Orontes on July 14, will be held.
Lady Grimwade, who is president of
the Isobel Henderson Free Kindergarten,
has lent her lovely Toorak home for a
5 p.m. to 7 p.m. party on July 8. At the
party well-known women will stage a
mannequin parade and wear hats which
Stella Frankel will bring from her Sydney
salon. Mesdames Bill Seymour, lan
Miller and Rupert Downes will be man-
nequins. Mrs. Peter Saywer (Win. 461)
is ticket-secretary. All the proceeds will
go to the kindergarten, and members of
the committee working hard for the
success of the party in (dude Lady Snow
and Wyn Kellow.
Many of the glamorous women who
usually throng the foyers on “first-nights”
were missing from the “Princess” for the
opening night of “Out of the Dark,”
presented by the Australian Aboriginal
League as its contribution to the Cen-
tenary of Victoria and Commonwealth
Jubilee celebrations. It was a splendid
effort and reflected greatly to the credit
of Jean Campbell, who wrote the script,
and Irene Mitchell, who produced it.
'Die first half of the programme was
devoted to the story of tribesmen who
celebrate the nuptials of the tribal chief’s
son and daughter-in-law with feasting,
song and dance. The second half was
given by aborigines who sing, dance and
play the piano in the manner of the white
man. In the audience were Sir Clifden
and Lady Eager, A. T. Smithers and
Mrs. Smithers, the G. W. Wisharts, R. T.
White, M.L.A., and Mrs. White, J. G.
Norris and his wife, who is president of
the National Council of Women, Mrs.
T. J. Ryan (representing the Queensland
Government), Mrs. Garnet Carroll, the
Ron Deckers, Mrs. Lester Bunbury and
Elsa Briese.
The Governor’s daughter, Jeanette
Brooks, will attend the Royal Empire
Society’s Junior Section Ball at the New

PERSONAL ITEMS
Victoria’s mental - hygiene system
should get a shake-up with the appoint-
ment of Dr. Cunningham Dax, of
Netherne Hospital, Coulsdon (Eng.), as
chairman of the State’s new authority.
Dr. Dax is a young psychiatrist
standing high in his profession. His
hospital at Coulsdon is world-famous
as a demonstration centre of modem
methods of treating mental illness,
and it was his energy and enthusi-
asm which made it so. His team
will be Dr. C. R. D. Brothers, Director
of Mental Hygiene in Tasmania, and a
Victorian, E. R. B. Ebbs, secretary of the
Health Department’s t.b. section. A com-
plete renovation of Victoria’s system is
contemplated—first job the Kew asylum.

George Dickinson, here accounted for
by Dubois, claims for himself no special
qualifications. Except those, as found
out later, which made him a War I
brigade major and G. 5.0.3 of the 4th
Australian Division at 21, and brought
him up all the rungs from a clerkship to
the managership of the Commonwealth
Bank (Sydney). One of the prime-movers

Coronation, Dickinson was born at
north-coast Murwillumbah, and left for
Gallip. with the 15th Battalion, to catch
a nasty packet at Quinn’s Post. But it
couldn’t hold him back from close-range
contact with some of the big shows of
the last war-year in France.

Bulletin story-teller Gavin Casey went through
a variety of occupations, including office, elec-
trical, motor-car assembly, casual journalism,
farm-laboring and mine-laboring above and be-
low ground. In the depression he kept the
dingo out mainly by motorcycle racing. His
second short story, “Nobody’s Goat,” was a
place-winner in a Bulletin competition. There-
after he sold about 25 stories to The Bulletin,
winning a humorous short-story competition
the following year, and, with “Short Shift
Saturday” a competition for all types of stories
a year or two later. He effectively used his
Bulletin reputation, together with much per-
sistence and sales talk, to get into the news-
paper game, and after three years with country
publications joined the Perth “Daily News.” In
War II Casey was State Publicity Censor in
W.A., and was a war correspondent for the
Department of Information in New Guinea. In
1945 he was appointed Director of the D.0.1.’s
News and Information Bureau in New York,
and was later in London in a similar post. Be-
fore becoming a feature-writer on the Sydney
magazine “People” he was Chief Publicity
Officer of the D.Q.I. in Canberra. He has five
books to his credit, including City of Men, pub-
lished last year in London, which has collected
some first-class reviews.
John Amadio, who was Melba’s flautist
and toured with her, as well as with
Tetrazzini and many other highlights of
the concert platform, was not nonplussed
when the other day he got, at short notice,
an assignment to appear at Melbourne
Town Hall with soprano Glenda Ray-
mond. At the same time he got a new
idea for a cadenza. Lacking time for
personal rehearsal he rang the singer,
explained the position, then put the head-
piece on the table and played his cadenza
while she sang back to him, and soon
they were note-perfect. Amadio’s first
success was gained at 1-, when he
played a composition for flute and
orchestra with the Wellington (N.Z.)
Orchestral Society—he was solo flute for
J.C.W.’s grand opera co. at 14. In 1925
he married Florence Austral.

in “Figaro” as Bartolo, and has now
been signed up to sing Bunyan in the new
opera “Pilgrim’s Progress,” by Vaughan
Williams. The Festival of Britain will
hear him as Ramphis in “Aida.”
“Macnell”: When a new and heavily-
gunned destroyer gets in its new skipper
a gunnery-specialist, that is good: when,
in addition, he’s a breezy, genial cove who
rushes enthusiastically from point to point

the Mediterranean Fleet welterweight
championship, and when muzzle-covers
came off was in cruiser Perth, again in
the Mediterranean, with carrier Illustrious

came after a doughty bit of work with
another officer, towing per dinghy an
ammo-lighter away from a blazing
ammo-ship in Piraeus Harbor, Greece.
Shifting east of Suez, he was cruiser
Shropshire’s gunnery-jack, under Collins,
in a succession of battles —Cape
Gloucester, Hollandia, Morotai, Leyte

New president of Melbourne Trades
Hall Council, 44-year-old R. A. Cameron,
of the Miscellaneous Workers’ Union, is
the son of Senator Cameron, former
P.M.G., who held the same position 21
years ago. The father was one of Perth’s
leading Labor anti-conscription orators
in War I; his son, who joined the clerks’
union at 17, served as a merchant seaman
in War 11. Since then he has sailed in the
more settled waters of union secretary-

the University of Edinburgh. Moll is
also a poet, publishing all his books in
his native country. Bald has distinguished
himself in Elizabethan scholarship. Childe

Dialed his last number (officially)—
appropriately in Jubilee year—after more
than 50 years with the P.M.G., E. J
Kelly. Starting as a messenger in 1900 —
six months before Federation and when
George-street, Sydney, was a forest oj
poles, cross-arms and wires—E.J. wound-
up a divisional-engineer of one of the
city’s telephone districts. Strictly of the
old school, competent tutor of many
“gun” cable-joiners, he was probably one
of the last surviving P.M.G. engineers
to rise from the lower ranks of the
Lines Section; for years now execu-
tive technical officers in the Engineers’
Branch have been specially-trained Uni-
versity graduates, his own son among
them.
Retired from the chairmanship of the
board of Ford-Australia, Hubert Charles
French, the energetic American who, in
1923, established the first manufacturing
plant for a major automobile company in
Australia. He selected Geelong, despite
its cognomen of Sleepy Hollow. From
there Ford spread its branches to Bris-
bane, Perth, Adelaide, Ballarat and
Sydney, while the vehicle which had been
the theme of a million music-hall jokes,
gradually changed its appearance to the
ornate streamliner of today. A natural-
ised Canadian, French was born at Battle
Creek, Michigan.
Passed on in England at 81, Dr. Cecil
Rollo Payton Andrews, distinguished
scholar and administrator, who did much
for secondary education in Westralia.
Londoner by birth, an Oxford M.A., he
joined the Westralian Education Depart-
ment as a teacher in 1893, and in 10 years
had risen to be Inspector-General of State
Schools, afterwards styled Director of
Education. A member of the Royal
Commission appointed in 1909 to con-
sider founding a university, he became a
member of the first University Senate,
which unanimously elected him pro-
chancellor at its first meeting. In 1911
he attended an educational congress in
London, had a look at educational work
in Western Europe, and, on return, estab-
lished the department’s first secondary
school (the Perth Modern School), as well
as several country high-schools. Since
his retirement in 1930 he had lived in
England,
Shortly after Roderic Quinn’s death in
1949 a committee was formed in Sydney
to raise funds for a suitable memorial.
It was decided to erect a headstone over
Roderic’s grave at Waverley cemetery,

poet to be placed in a public building
associated with Australian art or letters.

The Victorian State Services Orchestra
will shortly have as conductor a former
guest-conductor of the Berlin Symphony
Orchestra —Dr. H. Schildberger, who
came to Melbourne just before Hitler
erupted. A musician of intense enthu-
siasm, the new man immediately got busy
in the suburbs, founded philharmonic
choirs in Camberwell and Brighton, and
then formed the New Melbourne String
Orchestra. Gertrude Johnson then took
note of him and appointed him conductor
of the National Theatre Opera Company.
He will run the concert orchestra for
the Services in succession to Bert Thomas,
its conductor for 25 years.
Into the Silence;
George Fountain Webb, one of Darwin’s
oldest inhabitants, having gone there in the
nineties of last century. A cousin of the late
Sir William Webb, who, many years ago, rep-
resented the Northern Territory in the South
Australian Parliament, he was for many years a
guard on the north-south line, and is mentioned
by Mrs. Aeneas Gunn in We of the Never
Never. A life-member of the Northern Territory
Racing Club, George Webb took an active part
in all the sporting events of the north, and for
many years owned and ran Darwin’s first
picture-theatre, the Don Stadium. He was 81
when the call came.
In Adelaide, at 78, Arthur Cask, who, nearly
30 years ago, as relief from pulling and filling
teeth, nutted out the plot of a thriller based on
happenings on sand-dunes round Adelaide. No
Australian publisher wanted The Secret of the
Sandhills, so Cask published it himself. The
1000-copy edition sold out in three weeks.
Herbert Jenkins, of London, became interested
—so did thousands of whodunit fans, to such
degree that Gask gave dentistry away and full-
timed with his thrillers, some 40 of them. His
son Cecil was a war correspondent for an
American paper before joining the staff of
“Time.”
At Glenelg (S.A.), at 78, Edward Angas
Johnson, Adelaide’s Medical Officer of Health
for 14 years and City Councillor for 21 years.
Great-grandson of pioneer George Angas, he
surely established a record by being educated
at six universities—Adelaide and Melbourne,
Gottingen, Paris, Cambridge and the London
Tropical School of Medicine. An enthusiastic
botanist and an implacable defender of his own
convictions, he gathered a famous collection of
historical relics, which in the past two years
he had distributed to Adelaide’s public places.
At Maryborough (Q.), at 75, Harold Reed,
for close on half-a-century a central figure in
the business, public and sporting life of his
town. Five times mayor, alderman for a record
term, he was in Kruger’s show with the Queens-
land Mounted Infantry under Major (now
General) Sir T. W. Glasgow!.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
“Bungaree”; A feature was
a rajn and ewe from the Camden
Park flock, which has been
preserved on its original lines,
alongside this year’s grand
champion Merinos. Nothing
more illustrative of the progress
of sheepbreeding could be
imagined. The Camden sheep
are small, decidedly plain, bare
on the points, with short, locky,
open fleeces of fine quality;
something like stunted New
England hoggets. Few sheep
could be found in Australia cut-
ting Iks wool. On appearance,
the Macarthur ewe might cut
31b. to 41b. of wool; there were
Merino ewes in the show that
would cut close on 301 b.
The type of Merino on show
today is closer to the ideal than
ever, with size and constitution
to carry the long-stapled, dense
fleece that has been piled on
them without sacrificing plain-
ness of body to fly-attracting
folds and wrinkles.
The grand championship
went to an outsider. There
was an impressive line-up of
champions from super-fine, fine,
medium, strong and extra-
strong wools, pens, novice and
small graziers sections.
Grand champion was bred by
F. O. Gobbert, of Delungra
(N.S.W.). He is by a Kelvington
CMoree) ram. This was
Gobbert’s first appearance in
Sydney, where he competed in
the small graziers section, win-
ning strong-wool and champion
honors. Reserve grand cham-
pionship went to the big Mun-
gadal ram ; a ewe from this stud
was female reserve grand
champion. She was entered as
an extra-strong, but was diverted
by the classing committee to the
strong-wools, where she won the
championship. Merryville col-
lected the ewe grand champion-
ship with a beautiful animal
shown at the peak of her form
and which came up with the
medium-wool championship.
Mungadal became most suc-
cessful exhibitor by winning the
coveted Stonehaven Cup with
one team and coming third with
another. Winbri filled second
place.
At the fine-wool end Merry-
ville sheep were supreme,
although strongly challenged at
times. There was wider com-
petition in the super-fine section.
These wools have come into
their own again and sheep from
Merryville, Winbri, Tomlinson,
Traill, Nivison and Reid were a
delight to handle. Winbri
divided championship honors
with Merryville in the fine-
wools, but Merryville took all
super-fine championships and
reserves.
Medium-wools attracted some
of the biggest classes and nicest
sheep seen for a long time.
Cream of the studs met here, and
a sheep had to be exceptionally
good to collect a ribbon. Merry-
ville and Mungadal shared top
honors, but other studs that did
well were Hazeldean, Winbri,
Milthorpe and Wahwoon.
Strong - wool ribbons were
widely distributed. There were
some very big sheep in this
section. Stradbrooke (S.A.)
competed again and scored well.
Ram championship and reserve
went to Hazeldean and Wan-
ganella Estate respectively; Mil-
thorpe and Mungadal ewes won
top honors.
Extra - strong rams were
dominated by Boonoke. There
were some very good sheep from
Burrabogie, Yumoo, Strad-
brooke, Mungadal (reserve
champion ewe) and Milthorpe
(ewe championship).
Pen classes attracted excellent
sheep. One class called for a
group of six, bred by exhibitor,
comprising a ram over three
years, a ram two to three years,
a ram one and a half to two
years and three ewes of similar
ages.
Classes for Merino poll rams
attracted little support this year,
but this section has an un-
deniable future and these sheep
will be as important in years to
come as Shorthorn and Hereford
polls have proved to be in the
cattle world.
Novice classes were well sup-
ported in the medium-wools, and
although entries were not large
elsewhere, quality was excellent.
Champion ram was a New
England fine-wool bred by A. S.
Nivison, with a Gidleigh
medium-wool in reserve. A very
nice medium-wool ewe bred by
W. T. Pratley won top honors,
from a strong-wool Monaro
ewe, bred by D. G. Garnock.
Small graziers section
attracted both numbers and
quality—good enough in the
latter instance to hold their own
against all-comers. Breeders
hailed from Mudgee, Monaro,
Moree, Coonabarabran, Jeril-
derie, Warren and even Sydney.
Corriedales and Polwarths.
Corriedale entries were fewer
than last year, but there was no
decrease in quality. In the ram
classes, M. Carroll and Sons, of
Redbank, did particularly well
and went on to win champion-
ship and reserve with two very
nice sheep. They are big-
framed, with well-sprung ribs
and the champion had a.
beautiful even fleece, rich in
character and of splendid color,
but just on the fine side of 50s.
Gundowringa Corriedale rams
scored well, and in the female
classes better still. Last year’s
champion ewe was still unbeat-
able, but the Eurella reserve
champion will be a future force
to reckon with. Gundowringa
was most successful exhibitor ;
ribbons also went to L. F.
Bennett, Rocky Ridge, and Old
Redbank.
N.S.W. breeders rallied to
keep the Polwarth flag flying
and as a result, entries showed
an increase on last year.
Exhibits came from Milbrulong,
Manilla and Dubbo and both
horned and polled rams were
shown. The Gollasch Polwarths
scored well, taking champion
and res. ram and res, ewe
ribbons. Champion ewe was

British Breeds.
Entries of Border Leicesters
and Southdowns were not so
high, but all other breeds were
up, Ryelands in particular put-
ting up a great show. Two
breeds new to Sydney—Cheviots
and Suffolks —put in an appear-
ance,
Romneys were patchy. The
tops were good, but the tail
wagged noticeably. Tire Manton
sheep from Victoria scored well
in the ram classes, taking the
championship, and the Yelland
Romneys, also from Victoria,
did well in the female classes,
winning ewe championship and
ram reserve. The Glasson and
Hordern sheep scored well for
N.S.W., reserve ewe champion-
ship going to the latter stud.
Only one Victorian breeder
brought a team of Border
Leicesters, and this largely
accounts for the drop in
numbers. The Starritt sheep
were up to the usual standard
and collected most of the
ribbons, both championships
plus res. ch. ram, and thoroughly
deserved their success. A Foord
ewe from the same class as the
champion took reserve ribbon,
and this stud and Bumbaldry
were the only other place-
getters.
In the Southdowns, the
Brunskill sheep were still ahead
of the field, but the other
breeders are deserving of
encouragement and some of the
sheep they penned were very
good. Newbury in particular
put up a good show and, in the
pens, J. W. Maclean did well.
Dorset Horn breeders put on
a really good show. There were
teams from S.A. and Victoria to
challenge the N.S.W. studs and
the visitors did particularly well,
The Dawkins Dorsets have
gained an enviable record in
Sydney over the years, and this
Y ear was fully maintained
with ram and ewe champion-
ships. K. G. Luke (Vic.) also
scored well, taking both reserves

champions.
of the N.S.W. breeders,
Lmdsbury scored well, while
jy[ a rylebone and Shepherd also
f ea tured in the lists with some
very n j ce sheep. The competi-
tion was so keen and the
standard so high that a Dorset
had to be really good to earn
a ribbon.
Ryeland breeders put up the
best effort since this breed was
first shown in Sydney. Patrician,
Trelowarren and Glennie repre-
sented N.S.W., but the quality of
the Victorian Ryelands carried
the day and most of the awards
went that way. Ram cham-
pionship went to Burnwood and
reserve to Larne; top female
honors went to a very nice
Alston ewe and reserve to D.
Wadelton.
Suffolks on their first appear-
ance attracted considerable
attention, but exhibits were
naturally few and competition
limited. The Suffolk is a big
upstanding animal with black
head and legs and a fleece much
like the Dorset. It should prove
useful for fat-lamb breeding,
and its dark skin should be an
advantage in those districts
where dermatitis occurs.
The other new breed, the
Cheviot, is shorter in the leg than
the Suffolk and has a white, bare
head much like a Border. The
fleece, however, is more of a
Downs type —like a Dorset with
the harshness and color of a
Romney. The Cheviot is largely
used in Scotland and the Border
for crossing with mountain
breeds and should do well in our
colder districts.
The Jubilee Wool Exhibit.
Designed to make the average
person wool-conscious, it is a
pity the exhibit could not be
shown on a wider stage. The
mannequins were flanked by
fleeces and scoured wool, and
there was an interesting exhibit
of fleeces from various States
prepared by Grazcos.
Only the N.S.W. exhibit had
any degree of district sub-divi-
sion. Armidale showed a nice
selection of clean tableland fine-
wool types; Cowra had some
good XB fleeces ; Gunning had a
selection of shafty fines and
super-fines; Crookweli clean,
bright fleeces ranging from
super-fines to Corriedales; Wari-
alda —big, bulky, shafty bale-
fillers ; Boorowa —nice bulky
medium to fine fleeces; Coon-
amble—big bulky wools, bold
and shafty, with a bit of burr;
and Blayney—-a mixture of cold-
country fine-wools and cross-
breds.
The Victorian exhibit was
mostly Merino, including some
nice Western District wools and
a number of XB and comeback
fleeces, but it was not nearly rep-
resentative of the State. West
Australia had a small exhibit
tinged with red and black dust,
and Queensland had a number
of nice fleeces.
There is room for improve-
ment in displaying the fleeces
after judging, and Sydney could
well afford to take a lesson from
THE WEATHER
By Inigo Jones
The great southern sunspot group is now (24/6/’5l)
at its active position and the results of its anticipated! rain
action are obvious. As there is no following sunspot activity
the final cyclical cold spell of June means frosts on highlands
and in proportion at other levels.
An interesting possibility is the cyclical repetition of a
coastal gale with heavy rains on the Centra! Queensland
coast just before the middle of July, with an extension into
the Northern Rivers area of N.S.W., though not with heavy
rains. This rain is not certain as full records for the year
1809 do not exist.

Brisbane in this regard. There
the fleeces are displayed in three-
tiered racks, and every fleece can
be examined. In Sydney the
champion fleeces were displayed
on a round stand with the grand
champion fleece perched so high
in the centre that it was impos-
sible to see any of its character-
istics. The rest of the fleeces
were ranged on a table sloping
back from the spectators, and all
that those beyond the front row
could do was distinguish Merino
from XB.
An important omission in the
schedule should be rectified.
There was no section for super-
fine fleeces and they had to be
judged with fine-wools. There
was an outstanding fleece that
was nothing but super-fine, and
the judges created a special
award for it. It came from Vale
View Estate, Yass, and is the
sort of fleece that old woolmen
dream about—fine as a silken
cobweb, perfect color and beauti-
ful handling, quality—better than
BO’s —much better —and splendid
bulk for a fleece of that type.
There was a housed section
and one for grass-fed, unhoused,
and unrugged sheep, but even the
latter fleeces were wonderfully
clean. Merryville scored well
in the housed section in both
fine and medium wools. Their
fine-wool ram fleece eventually
took grand championship. Win-
bri. Vale View, and J. H. Traill
and Sons also scored well, the
latter being prominent in all
sections but particularly in
strong-wools.
In the unhoused section
R. C. A, Peden, of Goulburn,
showed some beautiful fleeces,
and was only beaten in final
honors by Merryville. The
medium- and strong-wools were
a beautiful lot —full of charac-
ter and with wonderful length
of staple.
The few Corriedale fleeces
were good. In the housed sec-
tion it was purely a Carroll affair
—three members of that name
participating. Quality was mag-
nificent. Long, shafty staple full
of character and true to type
with plenty of bulk. In the un-
housed section, some fleeces car-
ried more color but were full of
quality. There was wider com-
petition—Dulla Dulla and Mit-
chellhill joining issue with the
Carroll clan.
The opportunity should be
taken to build up a permanent
wool exhibit. There is urgent
need for such an exhibit
to be set up in each of
our capital cities—not in some
inaccessible museum, but in
some place like the Wool Ex-
change in Sydney, where it can
be seen and appreciated not only
by Australians but by travellers
from overseas.
Insect Pests of Stock.
“C.S.”: A lot of scientific
light has been beating on the
effectiveness or otherwise of
modern insecticides like D.D.T.
and B.H.C. against sheep lice,
ked, sheep flies, cattle ticks,
buffalo-fly and so forth. When
these drugs appeared they were
hailed as saviours of the stock
industry or something, and it
was freely claimed that they
began where the old arsenical
dips ended ; in other words, that
they would do a complete job.
Time has disproved the
claims, though not so far as the
potency of the drugs themselves
are concerned. In all or most
laboratory tests D.D.T. and
B.H.C. have proved themselves
as insect killers ; in field tests
good but not completely satis-
factory results have been
obtained, leaving doubts to
trouble both scientists and stock-
owners.
With the evolution of modern
insecticides came new methods
of application. Spray-baths were
found to be superior to the
plunge-dip for several reasons.
Presently there arrived fogging,
i.e., application of the insecticide
in a fine mist (fog) through a
power-driven blower. Again,
when tested under field condi-
tions, this method, though with
much to recommend it, failed
to give complete satisfaction.
The point for the stockowner
is that ectoparasites of stock are
not being reduced. Lice, ked,
sheep-fly, ticks, buffalo-fly are as
plentiful as ever. There are con-
tradictory reports of success and
failure with sprays, fogging and
dips using the new drugs.
Nobody denies that D.D.T.
and B.H.C. are sure killers of
pests. What is wanting is the
correct method of application.
It seems fairly obvious that fog-
ging, for instance, must cove
the whole animal, therefore th
formulation of the mixture itse
or the rate of application or th
operator or all of them are
fault.
In these matters scientists ar
conservative and often bigoted
against the suggestions and con
elusions of practical laymen
The man who sets out to show
scientist something new in th
scientists’s particular line wil
bash his head against a brick
wall. If the scientist is in an
official position the brick wal
becomes reinforced with case
hardened steel.
Overseas data, for instance
insists that a successful kill de-
pends on so much of the killing
agent to every square inch ol
the animal’s hide. In Australia
the official insistence is in the
percentage of killer in the dip,
spray, or fog mixture. There’s
a vast difference’ between the
two —it could be the difference
between success and failure —
but so far nobody here has
applied the former method, and
outside efforts to have the
C.5.1.R.0. or agricultural de-
partments make tests of it have
been coldly received.
The insect menace to stock is
so serious that nothing should
be spared to fight it. Snap dis-
missal of outside claims and
suggestions as emanating from
“cranks” shouldn’t be tolerated.
Indiscriminate blowing about of
fogs is waste of time and money.
It is unfair to the fogging idea
(in itself sound enough), unfair
to the drugs, and leaves the
stockowner cpnfused. On this
one question alone, as to
whether or not success depends
upon the amount of killer per
square inch of the animal’s skin
rather than on the percentage in
the mixture, tests should be
made at once.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
At Moonee Valley on Saturday the
Federal Hurdle resulted in one of the
best races seen over the jumps this
season, but it unearthed no form
likely to threaten The Feline’s posi-
tion as a very firm favorite for next
Saturday’s Grand National Hurdle.
Nor was there noted in the Common-
wealth Steeple anything calculated to
affect drastically the prevailing market
on the National Steeple, for which,
at time of writing, Llandrillo, Worro-
wing, Niblik and Bronze Laddie,
pretty much in that order, were the
most-fancied candidates.
About the Federal Hurdle there
was nothing of the leisurely proces-
sion often sighted in cross-country
events. A bunch of horses hotly
disputed the lead all the way, with
Tiercel, Foxen, Coalition, Hefty
Loon, and, until he fell near the five,
Rebel Regis all taking a good hand in
proceedings. At the turn Tiercel and
Foxen raced up to Coalition, who led
at that stage, and the three settled
down to a ding-dong battle in the
straight. Although strongly challenged
right to the post, Tiercel lasted it out
to win by a neck from Coalition,
with Foxen third, just shading Coun-
cillor.
If his owner-trainer J. Sing’s
appraisement is correct Tiercel’s win
must put paid to the Grand National
hopes of most of those whom he
beat, for Tiercel himself was scratched
from the National in the belief that
I his stablemate Fairy Fable had
much-sounder prospects. Fairy Fable,
if he vindicates that opinion, should
be somewhere round the scene at the
end of the National. A comparative
juvenile as jumpers go, four-year-old
Tiercel is to be kept for the Aus-
tralian Hurdle.
A very consistent minor-placegetter,
the Larchwood six-year-old Grey
Mom finally bagged the big end of
a prize when he beat favorite Burling
by three-parts-of-a-length in the Com-
monwealth Steeple. Even then, how-
ever, the grey had to survive a pro-
test. Some of the protests being
lodged of late seem to be stretching
optimism to the limit, and it will not
surprise if they eventually incur the
stewards’ wrath. The ground for
Saturday’s protest was alleged inter-
ference seven furlongs from home. It
was dismissed with little ado.
Some of the more-fancied Grand
Nationals candidates by-passed the
jumping events at the Valley, and,
instead, rounded off their preparation
with a gallop on the flat in the 13-
furlongs Mt. Alexander Handicap.
Among what might be described as
the fish-out-of-water in this event
were The Feline, Promise You,
Russian Boy and Bronze Laddie. The
form revealed in such circumstances
could mean anything, and probably
meant nothing. The Feline and Bronze
Laddie made poor showings, and their
three-figure starting-prices suggested
that they were not expected to do
otherwise. Russian Boy led some ot
the way, made a forward showing
altogether, and finished sixth.
Promise You did quite the best by
finishing a fairly good third, Hoyle
(J. Purtell) winning comfortably from
favorite Glenvue. About the only
conclusion one could arrive at from
these facts is that if the Grand
National Hurdle were a flat race
Promise You would possibly win it.
Casting back over the variegated
form produced in recent weeks,
present observer’s Grand National
fancies are: —
For the Hurdle: The Feline, 1,
Scarborough Chief, 2; Coalition, 3.
For the Steeple; Nibhk, 1; Worro-
wing, 2; Benarca, 3.

While Melbourne students are
devoting this week to profound
examination of the Grand Nationals
double their northern confreres are
wrestling with the Doomben len
Thousand-Doomben Cup conundrum.
A glance over the market prevailing
at lime of writing indicates that they
have looked pretty well to the four
corners not only of Australia but of
the globe.in their search for a solu-
tion, For the Ten Thousand the
most-fancied brigade, in appropriate
order, are Warrah King (hailing from
Newcastle), Davey Jones (New Zea-
land), Cellarman (South Australia),
Coniston (ex-Brisbane, but sometime-
resident of Sydney) and Field Boy
(Sydney). For the Cup the order
was The Pilot (England), Oversight
(Sydney), Shanalen (Brisbane), Le
Petit Due (Sydney) and Voussoir (ex-
Melbournite).
As is only to be expected in the
desperate 70-odd seconds of a big
field’s scramble for a £lO,OOO prize, the
Doomben sprint is almost inevitably
a rough-run affair, and luck can take
a big hand in the outcome. With
this in mind a horse that appeals
particularly to present observer is
Feld Boy, who has the early speed to
avoid trouble and the finishing ability
to give him a fair chance of recover-
ing from any trouble he should en-
counter. So, for the Doomben Ten
Thousand, Field Boy, 1; Coniston, 2;
Cellarman, 3. And, for the Cup,
Oversight, 1; Daasrae, 2; Shanalen, 3.

Saturday at Randwick saw Sydney
racing once again conducted on a
forbiddingly heavy track. Four of
the seven events were run over a
journey of a shade beyond seven fur-
longs, and times recorded ranged
from 1.32 to 1.33|, against a course
record of 1.22 for seven furlongs and
1.344 for the mile. Highlight of the
“Never mind the flamin' blackout —box on!"
meeting, with due respect to the con-
tributions of some of the four-footed
friends, was the return to the scene,
after a sojourn in England, of jockey
W. Cook, who proceeded at once to
lock horns with Arthur Ward in what
should be an exceptionally interesting
battle for the premiership.
Since, on a previous trip to Eng-
land, Cook won at his last ride here
before leaving and at his first after
returning, and since he had the first
leg in for a repeat of the same double
on his present overseas trip, it is
probable that had he chosen to make
his Sydney reappearance on a three-
legged billygoat the said beast would
have gone out a hot favorite. As it
was, he rode the very good filly Blue s
Sister in the 7-furlongs Nursery Han-
dicap, and, starting a solid favorite,
Blue’s Sister won with complete ease,
despite slipping badly at the turn.
Although, admittedly, most of her
form has been recorded against ott-
season company of questionable merit,
Blue’s Sister impresses present on-
looker as one of the very best of the
present crop of fillies. She could
prove near as good a miler as her
brother Blue Legend, but impresses
even more as likely to develop into
a top-class stayer.
With this ’ first-up success, Cook
increased his lead over Ward to four
wins, tmt Ward restored the status quo
in rather ironic fashion when ms
mount, Final Act, was awarded the
10-furlongs Novice Handicap follow-
ing a successful protest against Cooks
mount, Barrymore, who had passed
the post a half-head to the good,
the pair had finished locked together
wide out on the track, eight lengths
ahead of the third horse, Redress. It
was the first time a protest had been
upheld at Randwick since Capns
landed the Epsom on protest in 1936,
which leads one to ponder the futility
of many of the objections lodged over
the intervening 15 years. ,
Outside of Blue’s Sister, and, pos-
sibly, the Felcrag two-year-old Fel-
crest (G. Podmore), who won the
juvenile well enough to suggest that
he may prove a useful performer,
nothing noted at Randwick impressed
as likely to ever figure very promi-
nently in the record books. However,
the Coronation Day colt Fox Gold
(J. Deely) might be mentioned as
having clocked the best time of the
day for seven furlongs when he won
the Three-year-old, in doing which he
scored by six lengths from Prelate.

The three V.F.L. games in the
“split round” on Saturday drew about
66,000 people, most of them to Col-
lingwood, where the competition
leaders were stoushed by a flying
Footscray side. ’Scray broke to the
lead in the second and third quarters,
and began the last 40 points ahead.
About then the Magpies came out
of their lethargy, or whatever it was,
and battled and booted a way through
the Footscray backs to score 6.5 to 1.0.
The run was too late, and ’Scray took
the match, 12.5-10.12. At St. Kilda
the locals entertained South Mel-
bourne, and politely refrained from
doing anything to discomfit the visi-
tors; South, 13.15 to 7.7. At Carlton
the Blues nonchalantly booted 14.20
while the bewildered North Melbourne
managed 5.10. The round will be
completed next Saturday: Melbourne

It is best to draw a veil (double-
thickness chaffbags for preference)
over most aspects of the second
England-Australia Soccer Test at
Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday.
The final score, England 17, Australia
0, tells all too well the sorry tale.
However, while the visitors’ immeasur-
able superiority destroyed the match
as a game, they did give a magnificent
and highly-educational display of
accurately-controlled play in prac-
tically impossible conditions —the
ground was just a mud pool.
Summing-up briefly, the Australian
goalkeeper was the busiest man on
I he field throughout the match; the
English goalie spent a fair part of
he second half at any rate yarning
vith a couple of Press photographers.

“Pass-it”: The Sydney Rugby
Union competition resumed on Satur-
day after the break caused by
representative matches. The most
interesting match was that played
between Norths and St. George,
which resulted in an 11-all draw. It
was a very even match, with Norths
possibly a shade unlucky in that their
goal-kickers missed some very easy
shots at penalty goals.
In other matches Eastwood beat
Randwick, Gordon beat Wests and
Manly beat Drummoyne. The match
between Easts and University was
postponed.
The All Blacks last week had a
couple of easy matches, in each of
which the highlight was a mammoth
individual scoring effort by winger
Jarden. At Parkes (N.S.W.) the
tourists thrashed a N.S.W. Central
West team to the tune of 65-6; Jar-
den’s contribution of 38 points (six
tries and 10 goals) smashed the pre-
vious individual score record for a
New Zealand touring side, which was
the 28 points notched up against
Devon by Bill Wallace in 1905. In
Melbourne on Saturday the All Blacks
beat a scratch Australian XV 56-11,
Jarden weighing-in' with exactly halt
his side’s total.

Thought generally to be getting a
trifle long in the tooth, Ted Sprouster
(8 12|) actually produced some of the
best form of his long career when he
held Victorian featherweight cham-
pion Bluey Wilkins (9st.) to a draw
at Leichhardt. Many spectators
seemed to fancy that the wasp-hke
fury with which Wilkins buzzed round
on the attack all the time had entitled
him to the decision, but Sprouster
the while was quietly piling up
innumerable points with snappy
straight lefts to the head or body,
and the match was absolutely even.
Actually, if there was any dispute
about the decision it should have
centred upon an incident in the eighth
round, when Sprouster slipped to his
knee and Wilkins hit him while he was
down. By all the rules of the game
Sprouster won on a foul there and
then.

ing our food up to the standard of the
average working man. We received three
good meals daily with a regimental addi-
tion of coffee at 6.30 a.m. and hot soup
at 7 p.m. for those in barracks.
Our barrack-room —brick buildings
similar to Victoria Barracks —usually
accomodated 12 men with a corporal
i r charge. We had gas-lighting, and
a huge open fireplace at the end of the
room. Bedsteads of iron were of the
folding type, forming a seat by day ; there
were three horsehair mattresses about
2ft. 6in. square, three blankets, a pillow
and heavy linen sheets kept spotlessly
clean. There were tables and forms
down the centre of the room, with such
pictures or decoration as the men cared
to add —encouraged by prizes awarded
for well-kept rooms.
We had a canteen where good English
beer was sold at M-d, a pint, and even a
defaulter was allowed to visit the canteen
for one hour nightly. A man on guard
could have one pint of beer taken to
him for his midday dinner by the mess-
orderly. Drunkenness was rare. The
canteen had a piano and a stage where
concerts were held nightly, and once a
week professional art is!* were engaged
and paid the usual fees by the canteen
committee.
Other amenities included a grocer’s
shop, a magnificent library and reading-
room, a gymnasium nd recreation-
room, billiards-room with two tables, a
beer-garden for summer use complete
with a skittle-alley, three handball courts,
the usual sports-field, a pipeclay-room
where one could furbish equipment and
tunics without filling the rooms with
clouds of dust, a building known as the
“glass shed” for drying clothing after
rain and also used for settling arguments
with gloves.
School under a qualified Army school-
master enabled a soldier to prepare for
the Army certificates, the first-class, with
the addition of two extra subjects, being
equal to the entrance exam, for the
Bankers’ Institute. School was a parade
so many afternoons a week, and did not
interfere with a man’s recreation. Bv
regulation the Australian Army does not
permit a soldier to attend outside classes
or university lectures or to qualify for a
degree even in his own time.
Upon discharge a job was always avail-
able: commissionaire, police, customs,
post-office, railways and Government de-
partments, where ex-soldiers had prefer-
ence.
We were not eternally drilled, but had
“short frequent exercises” as outlined
by Caesar for his army. There were
fatigues and other jobs, but the day
finished at 4 p.m. when tea was ready.
If one cares to turn-up old drill-books
of the early part of the century it will be
seen that recruit-training for the infantry
occupied 16 weeks spread over some six
months. The man was then issued with
full-dress uniform, being considered fit
to wear it in public with credit.
Other than a few “stoppages” such as
Id. a day for washing. Id. a week hair-
cutting, Id. library and 3d. a month for
“barrack damages” (an unnecessary im-
position), a soldier’s pay was sacred.
There were three fines for repeated
drunkenness—there was no fourth, just a
court-martial. Compare that with the
lot of the Australian soldier, who is liable
to the most extortionate fines for any
offence.
Many extra payments were made' for
good-conduct badges, skill at arms, extra
duty, etc. —only a matter of pence, but
appreciated for its spending-power in
those days. There were no contributions
to superannuation, but after 20 years’
service and good conduct a life pension
" This reminds me, Agnes, of ‘Mary ’ ad a Little Lamb .'”
was granted from KM. per day upwards
according to rank. An old veteran who
died in Sydney some years ago had drawn
a pension of Is. Bd. a day for 55 years.
When all these amenities are afforded
our Australian soldiers, plus such as
modern times allow, then, perhaps, some
may object to the boys being treated as
human beings.—F. C. J. (N.S.W.).
Sewage and the Soil
Phosphorus is indispensable to animal
and plant life, and under natural condi-
tions the same material is used over and
over again—when animals and vegetation
die and decay the phosphorus is returned
to the soil, and there is also a constant
cycle of return of elements via dung and
the rotting of fallen leaves. Modern
civilisation upsets the cycle by bringing
foodstuffs to large cities, where generally
the phosphorus and other valuable ele-
ments are lost.
To offset this steady draining of phos-
phorus from the soil we are now mining
phosphate rock in places such as Ocean
Island and applying it to the land in the
form of superphosphate. It, however,
took ages for the droppings of seabirds
to build up those phosphate deposits ; we
cannot draw on them for ever. There
must be a drastic change in our treatment
of sewage.
Sir Stanton Hicks, of the University of
Adelaide, who has made a thorough in-
vestigation of the problem, states that he
saw something very near to, the ideal in
operation in Dumfries, Scotland. There
a capable young country engineer named
Wylie persuaded hard-headed, conserva-
tive councillors to provide £20,000 for
a sewage utilisation plant after his pilot
plant had demonstrated that his idea was
sound. Today that plant is paying its
way.
Wylie’s process can be summarised
thus: the sewage flows into settling tanks,
where the sludge separates from the
liquid. The latter can be disposed of
by running it into the sea or using it for
the flood irrigation of pasture land, while
the sludge is pumped into composting
bins, where it is mixed with household
garbage, street sweepings and any veget-
able refuse —even hedge clippings and
roadside weeds. Here the stuff is worked
by thermo-phyllic bacteria, which cause
the heat of the compost to rise to 180
degrees F, This heat, by a parallel to
pasteurising, kills all harmful organisms,
hut the thermo-phyllic bacteria themselves
thrive at the high temperature.
The final product is clean, uniform and
has a sweet smell similar to that of forest
rtiould. There is nothing “artificial” about
the process ; it is merely a speeding-up
of the way in which benign bacteria in the
topsoil turns manure into plant food.
The product is eagerly bought by farmers
at 12s. 6d. a bag, and, as Hicks remarks,
“when a Scots farmer pays that price for
manure it must be worth the money.”
In that way phosphorus and other
valuable elements can be replaced in the
soil; it is high time Australia adopted the
method. It works equally well with a
small plant for a country town or a huge
installation to se,rve a big city.—H. A.
Lindsay (S.A.).
“Compensation for Resumption”
As “W.C.C.” says (B. 30/5/’5l) the
State is within its rights in resuming land
without paying anything like the value
which that land or property would fetch
on the open market. The law which
makes this possible may have been just
and necessary when it was promulgated
in 1831. It’s out of date and unjust now.
Take the case of two men who buy
houses on opposite sides of a road. They
both work hard to improve their pro-
perties, adding to their values and in-
creasing the comfort of their families.
After 15 years they are comfortably
placed and their roots are well-established
in that community. They have “settled-
in.” Then one side of that street is
resumed for a railway. The lucky owner
retains his property at its full value ; the
other loses his and is paid what the State
thinks fit. He can appeal to a board
whose powers are limited by the same
act as that under which his land was
resumed. In any case he and his family
are uprooted and shifted, and it will take
them years to replace the comforts and
the little homely touches they had in-
troduced into the old home.
Similarly, as “W.C.C.” says, the State
retains the right to any timber, stone,
gravel, etc., which may be on the land,
and it may remove this without question.
Which means that if, as often happens,
a farmer is one of the few men in a
district to leave a belt of timber to
provide for his future needs and to
prevent erosion, he stands a good chance
of having that timber confiscated with-
out compensation.
In all cases of resumption of land or
property the State as a whole is expected
to gain, and it should be expected to pay.
To impose hardship on a handful of
people, to force them to pay for a State-
wide improvement, is undemocratic. If
the archaic law quoted by “W.C.C.” still
exists it should be amended.—Gravel-
snatcher (W.A.).
The Teachers* Federation
The attack on the N. S. Wales
Teachers’ Federation and the allegations
“that the education system is infiltrated
with Communism,” and that “the execu-
tive of the Federation is controlled by
Communists” (B. 7/6/’5l) are unjust.
I was a teacher for 50 years and head-
master of several of the largest city and
country schools. In all that time I never
met one Communist. There may be
some of these crooked-thinking folk
among the 12,000 N. S. Wales teachers,
just as there are Corns in all professions,
including the legal and medical. But
“infiltration” is an ugly word, and “the
executive is controlled by Communists”
is a wild and wicked statement.
' I knew the executive in a general way,
and for years until my retirement I was
closely associated with its members. I
can vouch for tjaeir patriotism, loyalty to
the highest ideals and personal integrity.
Of the president’s politics I am not
prepared to comment —he may or may
not be a “leading Communist.” But I
can say that any extramural action in
the executive comes from a small coterie
of malcontents influenced for the most
part by very personal motives and un-
healthy desires.— Wondalga (N.S.W.).
Starving India
Many years ago when Japan was
devastated by an earthquake, Australia
opened her purse, shiploads of goods
were dispatched, and a prominent Aus-
tralian was sent to Tokyo to attend the
distribution. Japan had been an ally
during the 1914-18 War. That was
enough.
Now that Indians are dying of starva-
tion we produce various excuses —there
are no ships, not enough wheat, no rice.
As far as official Australia is concerned
nothing can be done.
India has been a real’ friend to Aus-
tralia. Her troops held the line at Festu-
bert in 1914; two corps of Indians gave
Australians in two world wars a nine
months’ respite to train for war. India’s
4th Division was acclaimed in the Middle
East the finest fighting formation many
men had seen. Older men will recall the
comradeship on Anzac with Indian
troops, younger men fine character of
the Indians they met in the last war.
Those of us who have lived in India
and witnessed famine know the thin line
between hunger and famine ; of all those
grand soldiers we met, most of their
families go from year to year without
knowing what it means to have one full
and sufficient meal. A late monsoon and
there is famine. Weaker people tip over
the brink of semi-starvation into death.
And the unfortunate thing about famine
is that most of the decent honest-to-god
families suffer the most. The black-
marketeer and his type suffer nothing
Australia has a gallant comrade only
a day’s flying distance and 16 days by
sea from her nearest granaries. Surely
we can offer some help—and quickly.—
