BUCKING-HAM PARK ESTATE,
MEDLOW (Blue Mountains).
This charming Estate has its Railway Platform aln 08b
adjoining, and its level land proves it to be eminei tly
adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to h, ve
lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PAIiK,
which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKEu
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large -from 100 up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
' The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
.Years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-
prietor,

“Great Parkes": Is Parkes Great?
When that small individual, the Honour-
able Daniel O’Connor, Esquire, M.L.C.,
N S. W, Postmaster - General (we spare
him not one tittle of his official marks
of insignificance), bestowed the name of
the “Great Parses” upon a large noise-
making machine, hoisted to an elevated
position, the act was a mere dribble of
adulation from an obsequious mind. Your
toadies are, ofteuer than not, prodigiously
dull fellows, and as blind to the ridiculous
aspect as they are keen-sighted in regard to
the profitable side of grovelling. It is probably
due to this defect of vision that the bell
which the escaped N.S. W. Postmaster-
General has ordained shall be known as
“ Great Parkes,” bears somewhere stamped
on it the name of the O’Connor. In this
adjustment there are evidences of the inner
workings of the O'Connor mind. His hope
of fame is founded —brass-founded —on ring-
ing down the long-resounding aisles of time,
amidst the vibrations caused by “ Great
Parkes.’ When, in the future, some country-
man, dinned by the noise of the tolling, is
informed that it is “ Great Parkes ’
which clatters, and after inquiring whether
it had for godfather the National Park or
Moore Park, climbs up to have a look at the
car-torturing boll, he will perceive, by read-
ing the legend cast upon if, that there was
once a person named O’Connor, who was
head-postman at a time when there was a
parish or something of the kind known as
New South Wales. It is unlikely that
curiosity will be pushed further. The dull
bucolic will not pursue his investigations to
ascertain, after infinite research, that the
prehistoric postman amused a bygone
generation by bellowing, with empurpled
countenance, unintelligible rhapsodies on
post-prandial occasions, and mouthing ex-
cruciatingly funny oiations, studded with
screamingly pretentious sentences in, to
himself, unknown tongues, while expanding
his letter-slit at the reception of persons
distinguished among oars. To become alle-
gorical, who on this globe cares to know the
name, the breed, or the colour, of any one
among the dogs which licked the hand of
Dives, or the sores of Lazarus 1
• • •
It appears unlikely that the craving after
immortal fame will bo gratified to any person
who founds his expectations upon the cir-
cumstance that ho is subjected to disturb-
ance whenever Parkes scratches himself.
There is even room for doubt whether that
historic renown which Sir Henry Parkes
himself openly aspires to win, will reward
his strenuous exertions. The question
whether Parkes is a great man, as Mr.
O’Connor would seem to signify that he is,
by the baptismal name he has conferred
upon seven tons of metal with its tongue in its
cheek, appears worthy of consideration. In
order to clear the way, it is needful to arrive
at an understanding as to what is signified
by the term “a great man.” We might
otherwise be encountered at the outset, or
confounded in the end, by some moral con-
tention that greatness and goodness are in-
separable, and that as Sir Henry Parkes
is the embodiment of all the private
virtues, he must be great ; or, on the
other hand, by the baseless assertion
that inasmuch as he is chargeable with
almost every vice which disfigures a character,
he must be small. Nothing is more hopeless
than an attempt to define what constitutes
greatness in a man. Essentially it must
signify the possession of natural powers or
qualities which, when brought into action,
bring their possessor into' eminence. This
is merely a periphrasis, signifying that a
great man is a man who possesses genius and
has had opportunity for employing it. But
what is genius' The author of “Lacon”
says, correctly enough, we fancy, that “the
plain unvarnished fact, after all- that has
been said about it, is this: that genius, in one
grand particular, is like life. Wo know
nothing of either, but by their effects.”
# # #
If this be accepted as correct, the great-
ness of men must be measured by results.
And results are dependent upon causes. The
greatest of cows was the one which kicked
over a lanthorn and thereby started the con-
flagration which destroyed London. But, for
the achievement of fame, accessory condi-
ditions were necessary to this cow. Plenty
of cows have kicked as hard, but only to
this one did Fate ordain a lanthorn, a truss
of straw, a stall like tinder, and a wooden
city. Jonathan Wilde appears, from what
can be learned of him, to have had genius
quite equal to that possessed by Fouche, yet
Wilde lived by blackmailing thieves and
harlots and was hanged, ivhereas Fouche,
with a revolution-to work on, blackmailed
bankers and princes, and died a Duke. The
best way to arrive at an idea of what is styled
greatness in men is to consider eminent
examples. And when this is done, it becomes
clear that all idea of associating goodness
with greatness must be abandoned. Indeed,
so far as this popular conception of greatness
is concerned, it has to be confessed that
greatness and goodness are incompatible.
Alexander the Great would never have been
heard of after his own century had he not
been a thoroughly reckless and inhuman
brute. Caesar’s greatest repute is due to
his intended treason against his country.
Peter of Russia, Frederick of Prussia, how
much less great would not they have been
had they been amiable characters ? Marl-
rorough might have lived and died a led
captain in the train of some rich noble had
he been too lofty-minded to profit by
the prostitution of himself to Charles ll. ’s
mistress, and of Ids sister to James 11., and
would have died in poverty and exile had he
not betrayed James to William, Napoleon
Buonaparte might have missed the chances
which carried him to Empire had he been
too nice to accept a bride from the soiling
hand of Barras. Cromwell could never
have been Lord Protector, despite his
military talents, had be not condescended to
cant through his nose. The virtuous patriot,
Algernon Sydney, would probably never
have had the chance of exhibiting his virtue
and patriotism had he not kept up his position
by—living on bribes from the King of
France. Very likely there existed beside
him in public affairs some rival patriot who
sank out of notice because he wouldn’t take
bribes, and so was economising in the
country while Sydney was flaunting hisvirtue
in the metropolis.
• • •
It would he no sufficient retort against
any declaration that Parkes is a great
man, to allege that he has been or is a
bad one. A pure man might attain great-
ness in Heaven. Such a one might oven
become groat in learning or in scientific
circles. Ordinarily, however, the most
learned or the most gifted in science, would
not bo those whom the world esteemed
highest. Professor Holloway was, on the
whole, more widely celebrated than Pro-
fessor Simpson, and the pills and ointment
tau?ht that “ the blood is the life,” in
central China, for instance, where the virtues
of chloroform were unknown. To argue
that Parkes is a quack—an advertising
politician—as Raikes, the British Post-
master-General called Henniker-Heaton,
is of no avail. It may be admitted that
Parkes opens correspondence with all sorts
of celebrated persons, and when he receives
a dose of flattery in return for an application
of flummery, he invariably sends it to the
newspapers so that the vulgar crowd may
bo duly impressed with the idea that Mr.
Lecky, or Sir Charles Dilke, holds him in
the highest esteem and consideration. This
“bold advertisement” is a recognised
method of great men. Bucke, in his Book
of Human Character, treats of this pecu-
liarity. “In all stations,” ho remarks,
“supported by the public, nothing succeeds
so amply and so surely as quackery judi-
ciously exercised. Even groat men resort to
it.” A writer in the Edinburgh Review
expressed the same opinion in 1828.
Thus:—“We often feel tempted to say, in
these disingenuous days, when we have been
in company with any distinguished per-
son—-ho is a great man, no doubt, but
he is, evidently, a great quack also.” Conse-
quently, even although Sir Henry Parkes
stood convicted of being a stupendous hum-
bug in the matter of self-advertising, that
would be no bar to his being ranked as a
great man. Lord Bacon affirms that Socra-
tes, Aristotle, Galen, were men full of
ostentation, and affirms that vain glory
lielpeth to perpetuate a man’s memory. The
same philosophic observer mentions that
Tacitus attributed to Muctanus ' hat, by a
certain art, he made a display of all he had
said or done, which seems equally applicable
to Parkes. Certainly, we do not know who
Mucianus was, but probably he was reckoned
a considerable man in the time of Tacitus,
else the latter would scarcely have alleged
him as an example. Since, however, the
fame of Mucianus has died away, it may be
inferred that quackery will not suffice to
preserve the celebrity of a second or third-
rate man. This may, perhaps, be regarded
as discouraging by the sponsor of “Great
Parkes ”
# # #
It will not be sufficient for those who
would seek to deny the attribute of great-
ness to Parkes, to allege that he has been
gu’lty of actions infinitely mean or even
atrocious. For instance, that somewhat
notorious prison episode concerning which
he was reproached many years ago,
had an almost exact parallel in ancient
times. Dionysius, the bloody tyrant of
Syracuse, was a great monarch, yet he was
the inventor and enjoyer of that dungeon of
peculiar construction known as Dionysius’
ear, which was so planned that a funnel con-
veyed to an aperture in the tyrant’s chamber
every word which passed between the
prisoners incarcerated, and made their royal
gaoler the recipient of their most sacred con-
fidences. Nor will it serve to allege against
the candidate for greatness instances of
miserable malignity or pettiness. It is
surely undeniable that Napoleon I. was one
of the world’s greatest men Yet how
wretchedly small was his persecution of
Madame de Stael ! It is necessary to strike
an average. The incongruous composition of
human nature perpetually puzzles. Take
that same Napoleon, for example, the hero
of the Bridge of Lodi, the undaunted par-
ticipant in a hundred pitched battles, un-
moved by showers of shot and shell It was
the same man who turned white and nearly
fainted on the shoulder of a grenadier when,
in the Council of Five Hundred, some
wrathful members drew daggers ; the same
hero who, after the Fontainebleau abdication,
quivered and wept with apprehension of
personal violence while on his route through
Southern France to embark for Elba. Dr.
Johnson appreciated these variations and
apparently irreconcilable qualities in the
human mind when he wrote the line
Fears of the brave, and follies of the wise.
The last phrase will serve to confound those
detractors who would fain assure us that
Parkes is altogether devoid of talent, be-
cause he is author of such idiocies as the pro-
posal to change the name “ New South
Wales ” to “ Australia,” and of the ridiculous
“ Dead-house ” proposals.
* * *
Although it has been shown that greatness,
in the ordinary sense of the word as applied to
individuals, is usually inseparable from crime,
it would not be just to deny the attribute of
greatness to Parkes, merely because he is
accustomed to assert in the most emphatic
manner, and is supported by quite a crowd
of sycophants in that assertion (which wo
do not propose to discuss), that ho has
never departed from the paths of public
rectitude and virtue and is innocent of
any ill-deed. A man may have been
guilty of everything which is requisite
to put the stamp of greatness upon
his career, and yet may assert with
the most ingenuous effrontery that his
life has been unsullied by a single act which
he should regret. Apart from the slaughter
of over a million of men, immolated in wars
of which he was the originator, Napoleon
committed many acts which might surely have
weighed on his conscience. But, no ! After
all was past, he asked O’Meara, in St.
Helena, “ What reward have not 1 to
expect —I, who have run a career so extraor-
dinary, so tempestuous, without committing
a single crime ? ” This self-satisfaction is
much of a piece with the letters of Pious
Billy, late Emperor of Germany, to dear
Augusta, the wife whom he neglected for
pots of the ballet. During the war with
France, his letters were full of slaughter and
religious sentiment in about equal propor-
tions, and their tone has been epigram ma-
tised somewhat thus
Webe sent ten thousand French below,
Praise God from whom all blessings flow.

Parkes has never soared to quite so lofty
a pitch of greatness as that, but apparently
ho has alit on a lower branch of splendour
only because his chances have been smaller.
His despatch of troops with gatling guns to
Newcastle was quite in tho correct spirit, and
no sensible person would hesitate to believe
that he would have been equally prompt to
set a million men in motion to cross a
frontier, had he been a Minister in Prussia
or Franco. The qualities of a great man
were exhibited ; only the scope of action
and the scale of materials wore- limited. As
Grey says, his “lot forbade” splendid deeds
on a magnificent icale :
“ Nor circumscribed alone
Their growing virtues, hut their crimes confined ;
Forbade to wade thro’ slaughter to a Throne,
Or shut the gates of mercy on mankind."
This accidental drop into poetry reminds us
that Parkes lias been the author of some
peculiai’ly atrocious verses, and lias not even
evinced sufficient literary sense to come in
out of the rain when it showered critics.
His detractors allege that no man but a fool
could have published such flagrant evidences
of imbecility as Parke-5 has thrust under the
very eyes of people in the shape of maudlin
love-poems, and rickety sonnets. But those
who thus argue have cither not known, or
have forgotten, that Richelieu, who was
undeniably a very great man, exhibited pre-
cisely the same weakness, and exposed him-
self to the covert derision of his contempo-
raries by insisting on the public performance
of a series of dramas composed by himself,
of the most abject literary quality.
* * «
It will not bo sufficient even to demonstrate
that Parkes, during all his years of political
power, has never accomplished one consider-
able act. off his own bat, so to speak. It
may be true that all the enactments which
ho claims the credit of having placed on the
Statute-book wore really embodiments of
principles which he had opposed, and which
were conceived or battled for by other men,
until the public appreciated their value,
whereupon Parkes “conveyed” them and
patented them in his own name. But,
even supposing this Were so, and
everything which he attempted on his own
account was either a farce or a fiasco, no one
can deny that he has kept in office longer
than any other man. And this is as much
as M azarin managed to effect, all hough
Mazarin’s greatness is scarcely contested.
Only Mazarin made better financial weather
of it and escaped with some seven millions
sterling, whereas Parkes has had to be
satisfied with failing for less than a seventieth
of the amount. In fine, Parkes may
not be a great man : but he has many of the
worst symptoms of the disease. We defy
anyone to say that we have not held the
balance fairly in weighing his merits in the
foregoing article, and just to sum up and to
put the question entirely beyond doubt, we
shall conclude with a couple of quotations
from “ Lacon ” : “Great men, like
comets, are eccentric in their courses,
and formed to do extensive good, by
methods unintelligible to vulgar minds.”
Again : “Great men often obtain their ends
by means beyond the grasp of vulgar intel-
lects, and even by methods diametrically
opposite to those which the multitude would
pursue. But to effect this, bespeaks as
profound a knowledge of mind as that
philosopher evinced of matter who first
produced ice by the agency of heat.” And
now, if there remains doubt in the mind of
any reader as to whether Parkes be a great
man or not, it is no fault of ours. We are
confident we have made the matter clear
enough. We admit, of course, that we are
a great man ourselves, and that our means
of exposition may be “ beyond the grasp of
vulgar intellects, and our methods' diame-
trically opposite to those which the multi-
tude would pursue.” But we can’t help
that. We must submit to pay the penalty
of greatness.
The Anglo-Saxon “Destiny.”
The London Spectator, in a recent issue,
revives the old impossible theory of a great
federation of all the English-speaking races,
and in dealing with this subject it incidentally
fixes up a new destiny for Australia. There is
nothing surprising about this, for the British
journalist is perpetually arranging somebody’s
destiny, and in a general way he keeps his eye
on the earth and the heavens, and fastens up
the solar system when it chances to get loose.
Nothing ever comes of any of his theories, but
while they last they furnish amusement for this
old, tired globe ; and none of them ever do
much harm, for the human race drifts along
just the same. Possibly, after all, the world
hasn’t got any destiny in particular, and for
that reason, it may be, the plans of the news-
paper philanthropist fall flat. In the English-
man’s superlative egotism, it is an article of
faith with him that some day there will be
some great consummation of the Anglo-Saxon
races, when they will all unite together and do
something, or leave something undone, or when
they will be something, or else will give up
being something that they used to be ; and it
is presumed that all the scattered of the race
are imperceptibly moving towards this focus.
The dead Imperial Federation fad was a part of
this great scheme. The shreds and fragments
of the British empire wore all to join in forming
an immense Parliament, which would serve to
warm the inmost soul of every widely-severed
Briton when he looked at this monument of the
national greatness. It was considered by many
eminent authorities that even the humblest of
Victoria’s subjects would feel better when
there was a Federal Legislature, and would
throw out his chest further, and experience an
honest glow in the region of the stomach. And
now that Imperial Federation is only a damp,
unpleasant “ remains,” the Spectator advances
a new proposition. Instead of Federation there
is to be disintegration. Australia, Canada, the
provinces of the Cape of Good Hope, and the
other great “ dependencies ” of the Crown, are
to be transmuted into independent States ; and
then, when there are about half-a-hundred
separate Anglo-Saxon nations scattered all over
the globe, they are to be formed into a great
League of Peace, which will boss the whole
world into tranquility, and abolish war and
strife and ill-feeling for evermore.
# • #
Apparently the British newspaper is quite
serious. The great Anglo-Saxon League is to
be a perpetual brotherhood, and its mission in
the future will be to sit down hard on every
State which wants to fight with any other
State, and to send an ultimatum to everybody,
and suppress anything. Britain, Canada, the
United States, and Australia are to be the chief
component parts of the alliance, and it is taken
for granted, as a self-obvious assumption, that
they will all gladly enter into the coining Con-
federation, and regard it as a joy and a privilege
to do so. But apparently it never comes mte
the calculation that not one of these ooinpsnen

A certain N.S.W. M.L.A., who has

the literary services of A. G. Taylor.
mrts really cates a straw for any peace save its
()W n or that not one of them, excepting Eng-
lnul’ itself, takes the slightest interest in the
destiny of the great Anglo-Saxon race. If that
rxec has a destiny—apart from the inevitable
business of living and growing old—the fact
will doubtless be discovered in course ot time,
but many a nation seems to have none at all,
•md quite possibly the British people have
already developed all the destiny they are ever
oing to have. The world is full of nations who
—except in times of war and revolution—seem
to liave no particular mission except to get up
in the morning, and wash, and make money,
and go to bed again in the evening. The
patriotic Briton, however, always assumes that
there is, in addition to all this, some hazy and
indefinite culmination ahead, when his race will
vet up and do something which it never did
f e fo r e, and when it does this thing humanity at
large will be greatly benefited thereby. As, how-
ler about the only thing which the British
nation or any other nation, has ever done that
has not been actually injurious to Humanity was
to get up and wash on a larger scale than before,
ami to go to bed earlier than usual, it is diffi-
cult to imagine what the culminator can con-
sist of The dead theory of Imperial Federa-
tion and the still-born theory of an Anglo-
Saxon League of Peace were both supported by
many arguments, all of them as indefinite as a
spectre in a fog, about the mission of the
English-speaking peoples, and the great work
that lay before that mighty nation ; and both
these schemes were foreordained to fall flat
because nobody ever defined what that mission
or that work amounted to.
# * •
The supposition that the future Australian
Republic will ever join in a League for the
maintenance of universal peace is an absurdity
of which only a British theorist could be guilty.
The one thing which the British Tory is utterly
unable to comprehend is that Australia’s one
ambition is to stand out of all foreign complica-
tions, and that when once it starts its new
career it never wants to see nor hear—in its poli-
tical capacity—of the other branches of the
Anglo-Saxon people from that date right on to
the Day of Judgment. Neither does it want to
hear, in a political sense, of any other people.
It does not even desire that its foreign relations
should be of a friendly character—what it longs
for is to have no foreign relations at all. If the
outside world is at peace it will be glad to hear
of the fact, and if the outside world is at war it
may, or it may not, regret the circumstance.
That is to say, it will regret it just as much as
any other nation might do, but it is more than
questionable if any nation ever does feel
seriously grieved about a war in which it is
not personally concerned, and the majority of
mankind rather enjoy battles, murders, con-
flagrations, and sudden deaths, so long as they
remain at a safe distance. Therefore a League
of Peace is merely a scheme to secure peace to
the members of the League, and any member of
the proposed League which has got peace
already will naturally stand out. And as a
still more sufficient reason why it will stand
out, the League of Peace would be just a shade
more disastrous than a league for the promotion
of universal war. The only method by which
any confederation could promote general tran-
quility would be by taking a hand in every war
that arises, and assisting to pound the aggres-
sor ; and when he was sufficiently pounded the
moral principles of the League would forbid it
to take a share of the plunder. By the time
the united English-speaking races had knocked
out every military Power on earth, the great
principle of brotherhood might possibly begin
to make some progress, but in the meantime
the League would have to maintain the biggest
army and navy, and the largest war-budget,
known in all history. This does not read like
an attractive programme; and if the vaunted
destiny of the English people is to promote the
cause of world-wide peace, it would be cheaper
and more peaceful to have no destiny at all.
• * •
There is no doubt, however, that Britain does
long with a great longing, for an era of universal
tranquillity. There is no particular Christian
sentiment in this yearning, but at all events it
rests on a solid cash basis. Britain has lent
money to every Power of any fighting capacity
on earth, and every new war threatens to send
a long list of her hoarded millions to that
Gehenna which is paved with good intentions
and bad debentures. If she goes to war, it is
ten chances to one that her enemy is fighting
her with her own money. If she wins, she pro-
bably has to lend her opponent the cash to pay
the indemnity, and never gets it back. If two
other nations fight, it often happens that they
are both doing it with British cash, and then
there are two debtors being crippled instead of
one. Consequently Britain has abundant reason
to desire a long period of rest. But Australia,
Canada, and the United States have no wars on
hand nor any prospects of war, neither have
they lent any money for other nations to fire
away in gunpowder ; therefore, they have no
desire to bounce the world at great expense
into tranquillity, in order that Britain’s debtors
may have an opportunity to recuperate. The
British idea of an Australian Republic is
peculiar. To the Englishman, Australia still
comes under the heading of “ our colonies,” and
is spoken of as a “ possession.” If it ever gets
independence— a matter which is still regarded
as more than questionable—that boon is to be
‘ granted ” upon some such condition as that of
an eternal alliance, offensive and defensive—
some such alliance as the Spectator’s fanciful
League of Peace; but the majority of English
politicians still hanker after Imperial Federa-
tion as a preferable measure, and do not know
that their fad is dead and buried, and gone to
impalpable dust. And the fact that Australia
wants no Federation, no offensive nor defensive
alliance, no bund nor zollverein nor commercial
treaty, is a matter which the British intelligence
refuses to take in.
» * *
And the most incomprehensible thing of all
to the British patriot is that Australia should
wantonly throw away the “ traditions of the
Empire,” and should unconcernedly abandon
its share in the alleged glorious destiny
°f Britain. It is these traditions and
that aforesaid other article which make
it impossible for the Englishman to believe
in the reality of Australian Republicanism.
The memories of the old boiler-plated warriors
who went out amid mud and slush and thunder
to stick forks and props into each other at
Crecy—the recollections of the Ironsides who
snutiled nasal texts, and sold their enemies to
be slaves on the Virginian plantations —the
visions of a long line of kings, some of them
mad, all of them bad, and many of them drunken
—these are the things which the Australian
Republicans want to throw away with as little
respect as a Kurdish raider might throw away
a beadle. And not only that, but they propose
to sacrifice their share in the destiny of the
British race, which is still more unaccountable.
Probably it would be useless to explain that
this country doesn’t want to take any risks—
that most nations which have appeared in his-
tory seemed to have no destiny worth speaking
of, and those which were furnished with the
article generally had a bad one, and, therefore,
Australia desires to stand from under lest
Britain should have the much-drivelled-about
thing after all, and it should do some damage.
And if these provinces appear inclined to reck-
lessly sacrifice that other matter which is
vaguely spoken of in after-dinner speeches as
the “heritage of this great people,” it would
be of no use to explain that Australia wants a
new heritage of its own—if there is such a
thing—and not a share in an old, second-hand
article which never amounted to much even
when it was fresh. Also, it would be idle to
mention that the oft-quoted tie of a com-
mon blood is of no account ; or that the
future Australian Republic would join any
Anglo-Australian brotherhood either for the
promotion of peace or for any other purpose,
because the only way to make universal peace
is to fall heavily on any States which make war,
and that kind of peace would be too expensive.
In short, the ambition of this nation is to form
an independent State which will mind its own
business, and thus to follow the example of
Switzerland, the only Commonwealth on earth
which has consistently stayed at home and
looked after its own affairs, and never had a
“ destiny,” or a “ heritage,” or a mission, or a
K.C.M.G., or a desire to promote the peace of
the whole human race, or any other such sub-
stance. But no doubt this explanation would
fall flat. Too much history has driven the
British editor mad, and the idea of a nation
which doesn’t want to kill anybody, either in the
cause of peace or brotherhood or any other
cause whatever, is altogether beyond his com-
prehension.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Standing Still.
Following in the track of the Victorian
“ National Association,” the fatted Tories of
Queensland have resolved to strike out in the
sacred cause of Liberty, and a Patriotic League,
or something of the sort, has been called into
existence at Brisbane. Its objects are expressed
in the usual pamphlet—the same old objects
and the same old pamphlet that babble on for
ever, in every region where the Tory congre-
gates. The members of the League propose to
maintain the Constitution, whatever that may
be, and to lend a general support to the Queen ;
and they also have an eye to the moral aspect of
the case, and intend to prop up the Lord as a
respectable and well-meaning institution that
ought to be encouraged. They look with a
reproachful eye on “class legislation”—or
rather on the legislation of any class except
their own ; and they want to maintain Order—
whatever that may be also, and to preserve the
integrity of the Law. Further, the League
looks with alarm on the revolutionary ten-
dencies of a certain section of the community
which is going about like a roaring lion seeking
victuals, and it calls on all right-minded
persons, and respectable bald individuals, and
citizens with capacious stomachs, to rally up in
apromiscuous way, andmaintain sound principles
generally. Probably this poor, old, hazy associa-
tion isn’t aware of the fact, but death is written
large upon its countenance already. There is
one fatal defect in it and all similar organisa-
tions, and by reason of this defect the Queens-
land “ patriots,” and the Victorian “ National
Association,” and the British Primrose League,
and the branch Primrose League which came
out like a tired exotic in a pot, and tried to
plant itself in New South Wales, and even the
A.N.A.—unless it mends its ways —will all fade
away, and be bowled out, and will also pass in
their cheques, and be deposited in the bone-
yard of dead fads and extinct ideas. The defect
is that none of them were formed to do any-
thing. Some of them exist for the purpose of
whooping over something that was done long
ago, but the world can’t live by whoop-
ing over the past, or feed upon rockets,
and votes of confidence, and anniversaries,
and celebrations, and vociferations. Some of
them exist to prevent other people doing some-
thing, and have organised themselves for the
purpose of being an immovable stump on a plain,
but even the most immovable of stumps must
decay in the end. A few more exist simply
because they do exist, and the only cause of
their existence is that they are there, which is
exactly the same reason which leads a half-brick
to be in an uninhabited land. They are all
convinced that the destiny of man is to be as he
is now, only more so, if possible; and their
only object is to try and make the human race
more like what it is now than it is at present,
and to make each individual look more like
himself than he ever was before. And the one
thing which they utterly fail to understand is
that the world must keep doing something or
else lose its brains and its capacity altogether.
If all the world started to be a “Patriotic
League ” or a “ National Association,” it would
presently become so dense that it wouldn’t even
know hew to be an association. The one good
feature about the Primrose organisation is that
it dresses itself up in bed-furniture once a year,
and puts vegetables over a dead Hebrew'; it
would be a better feature still if it shunted trucks,
annually, or dug a hole and then filled it up
again, yet even the vegetables and the bed-
furniture represent motion in some shape. But
the Queensland “ Patriots ” and Hie Victorian
“ Nationalists” liave no dead Hebrew to travel
on, and, therefore, if the country could
exchange either of them for a shearers’ riot, or
a big street-light, or a conflagration, or a
decent-sized flood, accompanied by much loss of
property, it would make a good profit on the
transaction.
.
The Cheap Italian Labourer.
The regular yearly row about labour for the
plantations of the North has come and gone in
the Queensland Legislature. It has been
decided, as usual, that the country wants cheap
labour to “ develope its resources ” —that same
old development and the same solemn old
resources which have been trotted out so very,
very often before. It has also been decided, as
usual, that the white Australian can’t work in
that sultry land ; and, therefore, as the China-
man is prohibited, and the Coolie has been
tried, with results that were a trifle worse
than open insurrection, and the Kanaka was
abolished some time ago to make an adver-
tisement for the “Great Liberal party,” the
Griffith Government is now engaged in the im-
portation of Italians as the handiest method of
filling the gap. The men they want are the
hardy peasants of Piedmont, reared under the
shadow of the snow-clad Alps, and by some
extraordinary effort of hard lying it is assumed
that these exiles from the land of the avalanche
and the glacier are eminently fitted to fill the
bill beyond the tropic of Capricorn. In
reality, they will be found ten times more
unfitted to work under a northern sun than the
Australian himself. What Capital wants is not
tropical labour, but cheap labour, cheap
ignorance, and cheap slavery, and this whole
labour problen is based on a self-evident false-
hood. The given reason for the importation of
Chinese, Hindoos, Kanakas, ignorant low-class
Italians, and similar evils, is that the white
Australian cannot do the work required in the
cane-fields, but the white Australian can really
do any kind of work, and do it anywhere. »So,
for that matter, can the Englishman or the
Yankee; any one of the three will cheerfully
toil in the centre of Greenland, or on the Gaboon
River, or in any other spot on the
whole earth that is not absolutely pestilential,
and will tackle almost any extreme of
heat and cold that comes in his way —provided
the pay is commensurate. There is hardly a
town of any size in Britain, America, or Aus-
tralia which would not supply in a few hours
all the human material for a new Polar voyage,
or an expedition to the upper waters of the
Nile, utterly regardless of climate ; and when
the question is one of furnishing a Soudan con-
tingent to look for a lost crank in a hot and
howling wilderness, experience shows that the
Australian can camp out for months in a worse
climate than the worst his own land produces,
that the only real danger lies in drinking too
much whisky while he is there, and being
officially thanked in the middle of a wintry
deluge when he comes back. He is better fitted
to toil on a tropical plantation than either the
Chinaman, the Kanaka, or, perhaps, even the
negro, and the theory that these “inferior
races ” can labour where the Aryan cannot is a
hollow lie from beginning to end. When the
Panama Railway was in course of construction
the work was done chiefly by Africans, because
the European was said to be unable to face the
heat of the Central American forests, and it is
estimated that that little railroad cost the life
of one African for every yard that was con-
structed. The Suez Canal was made by Egyptian
workmen and they died off by thousands in the
process. The cheap coloured labourer, in fact,
often perishes five or six times faster than
the European when engaged in hard labour at
the tropics, but he has three great advantages
which recommend him to the Queensland
planter. He is ignorant and servile, therefore
he can be kept at work by means of kicks
and execrations, no matter what the surround-
ing conditions may be ; he is of no particular
importance, so that ten of him may die in an
insalubrious cane-field, and be buried with less
fuss than would be made over one white
labourer ; and, above all, he is cheap. And, on
the other hand, the whiteman has two disad-
vantages. The planter is still haunted by
memories of the old slave regime as it used to
exist in the West Indies and the Southern
States, and he absolutely refuses to recognise
that unskilled labour on a plantation should be
paid on the same scale as any other labour that
is equally hard and uncomfortable ; in short,
because the old slave nigger used to do planta-
tion work, he considers that the white man
should do it on the nigger’s terms, and the
white man naturally disagrees. Also, because
the plantation nigger used to sleep anywhere,
he considers that the white labourer should be
willing to hang out in a box, or a wheelbarrow,
or under a tree, and again the latter disagrees.
Apart from all these things, there is no tropical
labour problem at all. There is no place in
Australia where the capitalist can hang out
that the Australian workman will not hang out
also—if he is paid for doing it. If he is not
paid, he naturally refuses to hang out—that is
the whole secret. There is no question of de-
veloping the resources of the North ; the reduc-
tion of the Australian workman’s wages is the
one thing aimed at.
One Bushranger, One Vote.
An affluent citizen named R. G. Benson writes
in the following strain in the Argus. There is
a certain fitness in this, for, judging by the
letter, Benson is just the sort of individual
who ought to write to the Argus, and the
Argus is just the sort of paper that an indivi-
dual like Benson should write to
Sir,—At a short distance from my residence there
stands a cottage occupied by a once notorious bushranger,
who has cost the colony hundreds if not thousands of
pounds, and done much evil. I have been in the colony
42 years, and have endeavoured to do some good for my
fellow-colonists. Now, sir, docs the Premier or the leader
■of the Opposition consider me so credulous as to believe
in their sincerity when they state that this retired hush-
.langcr is entitled to the same elective suffrage as I am ?
This is the argument which the whole Conserva-
tive party travels on. Taking it all round,
however, The Bulletin is inclined to give its
vote for the retired bushranger for several
reasons. Firstly, the world knows pretty well
the amount of evil which he has done, while the
amount which may or may not have been done
by that affluent citizen, Mr. Benson, is still an
unknown quantity, and an individual who
would write such a letter looks as if he might
do a good deal of evil. Therefore, this paper
would rather trust the bushranger with a vote
than it would Mr. Benson, the former being a
known and the latter an unknown quantity.
Secondly, if a bushranger can’t repent enough
to have a vote on earth he can hardly repent
enough to go to Paradise, unless voting is a
tougher job than going to Paradise ; and this
consideration seems to knock the whole Chris-
tian religion on the head, and if the Christian
religion is knocked on the head it is hardly
worth while for Mr. Benson to write to the
papers stating that he has done good for 42
years, for the whole affair doesn’t matter. This
consideration is advanced chiefly because the
writer of the letter is evidently a hardened and
incurable Christian—in fact, nobody except his
kind of Christian would ever have provided
such a document. Thirdly, the law doesn’t
refuse the ex-bushranger a plural vote, or a
dozen plural votes, because he is an ex-bush-
ranger, but because he lives in a cottage and
doesn’t own property ; if the retired solicitor of
the high-roads had enough property he would
have 20 votes, and if all the 12 apostles and the
fathers of the early church pigged it in the
cottage in his stead, they would have only one.
Consequently the One-man-one-vote question
does not affect this matter in the least, and Mr.
Benson in advertising his own goodness and
trying to blast his neighbour’s character commits
a wholly gratuitorrs hunk of meanness. It
would be quite as much to the point if he
wrote, stating that there was a notorious ex-
criminal in an adjacent house, and demanding
to know if, considering this circumstance, wheat
was going to go up the year after next. Still,
when Benson thuds down his retired bush-
ranger in the solid columns of the Akgus, and
asks if, in the face of such a circumstance as
this, plural voting shall be abolished, the flabby
statement almost looks like an argument, and
may even pass for one in certain quarters.
Toryism has travelled for a good many years on
just such arguments as this, and the only reason
why it can’t travel much longer, is that the
world has gotdead-tired of the individual who (by
reason of our crookedly-adjusted social system)
plunders in a bank, and the other individual
who used to plunder in the bush might be a
pleasant change. Anyhow, The Bulletin is
in a Scriptural mood to-day, and it remembers .
that there is more than one repentant thief who
makes a good show in Holy Writ, while there
is not one repentant bank or reformed building
society in the whole volume, and hardly one
really square capitalist, and, therefore, when a
wealthy and influential citizen has the cast-iron
front to write, stating that he has done good
for 42 years, it feels doubtful if he ought to
have any vote at all.
♦ ——
The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. claims to have
practically solved the sugar enigma and to have
proved the Central Mill system. Its estate of
Homebush, near Mackay, has been split up into
small sugar farms. Each tenant signs two
documents—a lease and an agreement. The
lease is for five years, with the right of pur-
chase at any time within three years—one-
fifth cash and four annual instalments ; price,
for bush land, £ 1 per acre, and for cultivated
land, £5 per acre. The agreement simply binds
the farmer to grow a certain quantity of cane
and patronise tlie Company’s mill. The Com-
pany pays 13s. per ton for cane; when its
patrons’ area of cane reaches 600 acres, it will
pay 13s. 6d. per ton, and 900 acres, 14s. per
ton. Rations will be advanced, if necessary,
to the limit of 10s. per week, and in some
cases horses and implements are supplied on
terms. Over 1000 acres have already been
taken up, and applications are so numerous that
the Company can pick its tenants. It seems
that black labour is not necessary at all to
preserve the sugar industry. Neither is black
nor yellow labour needed in the Northern

barnacles.
♦
Whom do the Labour-party represent ? Wage-
earners primarily; toilers with hand or head’
mind or muscle, whether in the shearing-shed,
down the mine, at the forge, in the factory,
behind the counter, or at the desk. What are
the qualifications for the representation of
Labour ? It is not absolutely essential that its
representative should have been a worker,
either with hand or head. The man who has
been overworked, either mentally or physically,
cannot have had the time necessary for the
study of economic problems, and, therefore,
cannot intelligently represent Labour. The
worker whose democracy is not the result
of thought but simply the growth of
environment, a consequence of birth in
lowly circumstances, may—nay, does—in many
instances, become a conservative on elevation
above his primary social state. It is, therefore,
evident that the sole qualifications for Labour
representation are sympathy and a knowledge
of economic law as applied to social problems.
The son of a wealthy man, educated at a
university, reared in the lap of luxury, having
espoused democratic principles and shown his
unselfishness, his courage, the universality of
his sympathy, by daring to make public declara-
tion of democratic faith, not fearing loss of
social caste or family friendships, has thereby
given the very highest proof of fitness for
Labour representation. If such sympathy could
be found, allied to high intellectuality, and pro-
found knowledge of social problems, there would
stand revealed an ideal leader of democracy.
Your candidate whose sole qualifications are
10 hours passed previously in daily labour, has
small claims for consideration.

810 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, August 5, 1891,
Mv Dear Moorabinua,—
Sydney’s AA-omen “Crusaders ” against feminine deviltry
in general iioav number 50 members, and there is a large
ten-to-one chance that one of them at least will have her
face scratched before she’s a year older. For instance,
the other day a charming creature Avith a golden aureole
of hair and burst boots Avas reclining in a dtigagb manner
on a seat in the Domain Avhen a she-crusader came along,
hungry for a subject. So she went to the blonde lady and
asked her to give up doing it at once, and come Avith her
to the Home, and reform and be a credit to the Crusaders,
to all of Avhich the reclining angel listened Avith cold and
haughty amazement. What ans Aver she made deponent
knoAveth not, but anyhow, at the conclusion of the inter-
view, the Crusader was seen going east Avith frightful
velocity, while the seraph jumped on her bonnet. The
moral of which, I suppose, is—Never try to reform any-
body over your own size and weight.
The “Crusaders,” by the Avay, are supposed (in their
own Avords) to “ frequent the haunts of vice.” Inviting,
isn’t it ? But Avhat a promising opening for the Church
Society, Sunday-school young Avoman Avhose conscience
Avon’t permit her to read Zola !
Tempe ball, in Centennial Hall, on 29th inst., was a
social outbreak on a good floor, Avith passable music and
far too excellent a supper for a charity spec, when quick
profits and smart returns should be the order of march.
There Avas a fairly large attendance, Avith a preponderance
of women ; and it Avas rather sad to be a sitter-out on this
occasion, because there Avas no dais croivded with dis-
tinguished patrons to doat upon during Avails. The hall
Avas rather bare-looking, OAving to no decoration (except
those “ herc-Ave-are-again ” Botanic Gardens loan-palms
on the platform), though the smartly-dressed female
majority made the scene look passing gay and festive.
But the lighting in the cloak-rooms Avas dim and holy as
usual. Why don't they prong out a gas-jet over the main
mirror ?
There were many fresh-looking, handsome dresses.
Mayoress Manning wore a toilet I have already noted ;
Mrs. F. B. Freehill (hon. sec.) Avore daffodil brocade,
chiffon, and emerald-gold trimming, beautiful bouquet of
daffodils and violets; Mrs. W. F. Brennan (hon. sec.),
ivory brocade and chiffon ; Mrs. D. O’Connor, primrose-
tulle and brocade ; a pretty patriotic array was in yelloAV
brocade, Avith girdle and wreath of real wattle blossom,
which lasted bravely through the fray. There seems to
be more Avear and tear in a Aviry Australian floAver than in
a AA'hole box of artificials. A legal dignitary's daughter
Avas appallingly dowdy in pinky silk and crushed green
tulle ; Mrs. J. 11. Carruthers wore black and a strawberry
fan; Mrs. H. Levien, black lace over white satin, black
ostrich trimming, diamond necklace ; Mrs. W. Carson, in
pale-blue silk, Dorothy train in silver and blue ; a lady
with dyed hair Avas zebra-ish in a striped frock ; a Avhite
net frock, dqtted Avith red spots, looked like incipient
measles. A girl in a bright blue silk should not have
carried a fan of violets ; and two strange damsels, in
mottled grey Avalking frocks, torn out locks, and patches
of white SAA'ansdoAvn, reminded Yours Ever of the
“ guests” at a stage ball.
Talking about dances—Avhat a discreet community is
dying to Uiioav is this—whether, when a couple pause in
the midst of a mazy Avaltz—it is the correct caper to still
clutch each other as when rotating, and Avalk slowly down
thy room thus encircled? It is rather an Arcadian effect
in a public ball-room, especially when she is married and
he is—well, it is beside the argument Avhether he is single
or married.
Still harping on Tempe ball I cannot say I quite
approved of the patent train-suspenders one or tAvo of the
women wore. In one instance a girl hoisted her rear
draperies on to one of them, and the nasty thing sprung
a leak, or broke a shaft, or something, and the result Avas
quite tAvo feet of revealed lingerie, Avhile the lady rotated
sublimely unconscious that her safeguard had gone
wrong and hauled up yet another yard of frock on its OAvn
’sponsibility.
After a long and serious contemplation of the Avoman in
evening dress who ruins her tout ensemble by pinning on
an ox-like garland of all possible colours, I have come to
the conclusion that she is more to be praised than blamed
for the awful split-rainboAv effect she sometimes produces.
Because it is mostly either Gussie or hubby Avho precipi-
tates such garlands, and what woman worth the name
would put them aside as “ out of harmony ” Avhen he has
had them put together expressely for her ? So she pins
blue on red and green on orange with a reckless self-
sacrifice that Avould make a scorched martyr sit up Avith
astonishment. Noav, as a way out of all this chromatic
agony, I should suggest that Gussie either choose only
neutral-tinted blossoms, or else ascertain what colour
Sophonisba is coming out in beforehand.
I must honestly confess that I felt rather “good”
and self-sacrificing, when I gave up the “Theodora”
primiiire on 30th ult., to attend a private performance of
amateurs at the Royal Standard of two (!) new plays by a
local man—Mr. Lester Bellingham—but the unselfish
feeling wore off during the evening. The first, a broad
farce, entitled "Glanamman Villa,” was really amusing,
altho* interpreted by amateurs—two, at least, of whom
would wreck the productions of Pinero if he gave them
the chance ; but the others, Misses Nixon, Cooper and E,
Grant-Cooper performed very fairly. Head and shoulders
over the company Avas the author, as Donald Clackman-
nan, an entomologist, got-up like CartAvright in “The
Middleman,” and the fun of the thing was caused by his
beetles getting loose among the company. His consoling
explanation (as nearly as I can remember it), when the
bugs are upset again and terror reigns supreme, “Don’t
be afeeh), Teddies! ’t(p only the Magnis Crustie—never
known io'tfalk,” brought down the house. The dialogu i
Avas good and natural, and the characters were alive.
Allowing for the awful handicap of being played by
amateurs—the best of whom always has something
uncanny about him—“ Glanamman Villa” went so well
that, Avith a little judicious doctoring by someone who
knoAvs the stage, it Avould make an amusing curtain-raiser
at any theatre. The second piece, “ The Tempter,” had
a dramatically concluded first act, but the second was
wordy, pointless, and ended very cheaply, especially for
the Aveak young man Avho “ preaches” so babblingly. For
one thing, instead of the betrayed Miriam (disappointingly
played by a woman of Avhom I had expected better things)
shooting the Tempter, it Avould have been far more up to
date had he departed in peace—like the Frenchman
does in “Impulse.” At the conclusion of the show the
author was loudly howled for by a large evening-dress
house.
Talking about “ evening-dress” houses, what makes me
so wild (as Toole used to say) is when a delicate girl Avith
a cough like the exhaust-valve of a woodcutting machine
shivers into a theatre with most of her clothes off at the
top and then sits sneezing and choking and barking and
spoiling the Avhole thing for the victims round about her.
Sometimes she draAvs up a little plush rag and drops it
over her vertebrae, but this only makes things worse, for
when Gussie is looking it is allowed to drop gracefully off
while the cold breeze goose-fleshes her bare bronchial
regions and the back toav groans aloud.
The committee of the “ Arts and Science” Exhibition—
Avhich is to take the place of the usual hall in aid of St.
Vincent’s Hospital this year- (Cardinal Moran, who knows
a thing or tAA'O, disapproves of dancing)report satisfactory
progress, the plain and fancy needlework entries pro-
mising to be very large. Lady Darley, with the president
(Mrs. Goodlet) and hon. sec. (Miss Harrison), deputationise
Lord and Lady Jersey to open the show, which, it is
hoped, Avill be as successful as their cause is deserving.
Nevertheless, one cannot help thinking that a hall AA'ould
pay a bigger dividend. In the ball arrangements, the
only thing the committee actually paid for were the hall-
rent and the music—everything else Avas given, from the
champagne to the ticket-taking. The fair opens in the
Centennial Hall on 31st August, and closes on the Bth
proximo.
Ingenuous ad. from Sydney D.T.:—
■vyiLL someone advise young English Lady how to
” make money? Ruby, P. 0., Glebe-road.
Of course someone will. The philanthropist Avho is in the
habit of “lending young widow £5 ” will probably point
out that borroAving neat sums from strange but benev'o-
lent gentlemen is one of the very best Avays of doing it.
Then the bachelor Avho AA’ants a “ musical housekeeper ”
may possibly submit that looking after him is a good
financial spec, (photos, exchanged). Also, all the vague
sentimentalists “Avith vieAv to matrimony”—as per six-
penny advts.—will offer their advice on general principles.
Ruby will probably have a great many Avays pointed out
to her, only it seems rather a pity that she didn’t stick to
the old “ view matrimony” ad.
Regarded as a vice-regal show-ground, Sydney is a dead
city at present, for both Lord and Lady Jersey, Avith Lord
Ancrum as special aide-de-camp, deserted for a Southern
flight on 29th ult., and AA'on’t be back until the 19th inst.
Melbourne, Adelaide, and Broken Hill will be visited
during the Avell-earned little holiday, and Hopetoun and
Kintore will be their attentive hosts most of the time.
G. H Smith & Son, hatters, on the George street block,
have several styles in head gear, straight from Heath &
Co., London, in stock just iioav. The novelty in feminine
fopping-off is a three-cornered hat in all colours, effec-
tively trimmed, Avhich is obtainable noAvhcre else. The
dainty soft riding hats in tan, or invisible-blue felt, slioav
a becoming round shape, and are moderately priced,
and there are any number of the new sailor hats rather
high in the croAvn and trimmed Avith three lines of velvet
Avhich are going to supersede the absurd little prevalent
pancakes. In gentleman’s top dressing there are tAvo
appealing novelties. The first is the corded-silk crush
hat, beautifully shiny and only a little dearer than the
merino opera hats which alAA’ays look so rusty on the
head ; the second is the handsome tweed shooting cap in
all tan colours Avith a curtain to let down at the back.
These seem a little expensive at first, but the tAvced Avill
stand any Aveather and will last, generally speaking, for
ever. Smith & Son also have another quantity of the
stylish terai hats on vie Av.
The latest grin in Melbourne is about an ex-Melbourne
lady dignitary Avho blossomed out into a musical evening
recently, and sent out cards to a large circle of critics in
the guise of friends. Some of these—as etiquette alloAvs
in such an instance - didn't ansAver post-haste, upon which
out Avent a sort of circular begging them to do so “to
facilitate the caterer's arrangements.” Noav she should
have Avritten in the first instance “ R.S.V.B. to Gunsler
and Co.”
The neAvest artistic extravagance for the combed-up
locks of the elite is called the jeAvel-net. It is made
square and formed of light gold-links and edged Avith
tiny gold balls the net being studded Avith tiny tAvinkling
precious stones and costing (for a genuine sample) nearly
20 guineas. White silver nets poAvdered with tiny
emeralds or diamonds are affected by blondes, while the
sun-kissed charmer favours the golden frame-work. This
fetching novelty will probably have a run here in brass
and glass.
Sydney University Dramatic Society's performance of
“Old Law,” on 31st ult., went off specially Avell for an
amateur affair—the dressing and declaiming being quite
good. But I really must submit that the double-enten-
dres of a seventeenth-century play are too breezy for
nowadays, and, therefore, some of the passages Avere
enough to make one dive behind one’s fan, and also
marvel at the cool composure of the lady-graduates who
—through long association with the classics, probably
didn’t seem to mind it at all. Antigone, in a pink toga
edged with silver braid, and looking and speaking exactly
like Emma Gwynne, Avas the most successful among the
ladies, and Simonides, Cleanthes (successfully played by a
pretty youth Avith a Avell-shaped—er—ankle, who postured
and declaimed as if to buskin-born), and Onotho, the clown,
shone bright among the others—perhaps because they
hadn’t much to say. The scenery Avent hitchlessly to the
guiding hand of Harry Leston as stage-manager, and
made the groupings distinct. The entr'acte music, by the
way, Avas rather light for a ’Varsity demonstration—five-
flngerish fantasias on “ Fiddle and I,” “ Mona,” and that
kind of thing.
Some vice-regal amateur theatricals are to lake place
at Sydney Government House near the end of the present
month. The secretary (Mr. George Goschen) is taking a
prominent part in the arrangements, and invitations are
eagerly desired by the people who like that sort of
thing.
Manly spinsters’ ball in the local Oddfellows’ Hall smelt
just like the flower-shoAv, OAving to the vast number of
ferns (which give out a damp, muddy odour in a hot room)
used in the Japanese decorations. Miss Dean (hon. sec.)
wore black velvet and jet, and carried a pretty bouquet
of rosebuds, and the dresses generally were very good.
All the evening spinsters wore powder and patches. Men
grumble at powdered hair, by the way. It Avorks so into
the grain of the coat—especially if “ she” exercises her
head, in tender moments, as a pestle in the mortar of his
coat-collar.
The third performance of “ Theodora ” at Sydney Royal
aa as varied by a crash of O.P. scenery in the circus-scene
and it was lovely to see how Duquesne folded Sara pro
tectingly in his arms and both their heads popped out
through an aperture in the falling wall, while the audi-
ence cheered and the divine one doubtless longed to be a
real Theodora for a minute to order the scene-shifters out
to be hanged in a body. Theodora wears two really gyp
attires of the fancy-dress variety. In the first act she
looks something like a Pope, for the head is covered with
a mitre-shaped cap covered in jewels, and in her hands
she carries what looks like an Annunciation lily. The
long, trained cloakish covering was of yellow satin brocaded
thickly in gold under cover of brown-golden coloured
gauze embroidered with medallions of cherub heads,
sandals (they do say those little radish-like toes are only
painted “ fingered ” stockings) and long red hair. In the
fourth act a delicious mingling of crushed strawberry,
white, and a kind of pearl grey, all designed in gold—a
silver net round the hair. Fifth act, ditto, minus the
upper covering of white, which made the gown all
pinkish, scarf shawl of cream mill, spangled in gold. In
the sixth act, sea-green court train from shoulders
embroidered in glittering colours, gold predominating;
under dress of blue and mass of scarlet and blue and
green and gold design ; jewels everywhere—a gorgeous
array which went well, and the throng of regardlessly-
gotten-up Australian supes, who betrayed their origin by
hanging out to watch Sara with their eyes and mouths
open. In the last act, cream mill over green silk,
designed in gold—“ cestus ” (she wears one all the time)
in gold.
There were hardly any dresses in the circle. One
woman looked charming in a buttercup gown, with
puffed Tosca sleeves of chiffon, and huge black and gold
fan ; two of the ugliest old parties there had the most
nappy diamonds in the place ; and an obviously and
badly-rouged young man (ugh !) in the prompt stage-box
tried to modify his inartistic blush by shading it behind
his companion’s big red fire-screen fan.
Bernhardt does keep the local jeunesse dor tie —heirs of
rag-warehouses and scions of spirituous millionaires—at a
great (French) distance. I am told that their small
visiting-cards, neatly engraven in the centre, rush into
the divine presence with all the facility in the world,
while the palpitating, brushed-up gardenia-adorned appel-
lants are left coldly on the scraper. But what sort of a
swell must Alphonso of the—er —Treasury seem to a
woman who can hardly remember which Emperor she
snubbed last!
Madame Bernhardt was present at a reception got up
in her honour by one or two fair admirers (she keeps the
other sort at dagger’s length) on 30th ult., “ from 3 to 5.”
I am told there Avas a fair attendance, and the rooms Avere
draped in tri-colour. Also, that a vague doubt existed as
to whether Madame—coldly received at first by “sassiety ’
—wasn’t going to get even by not turning up Avhen they
tried to entertain her. HoAvever, this probably didn’t
occur to the lady.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Dr. Hansard, of Concord, gives a large ball on 21st
instant. Over 300 guests are expected, including a
number of Richmond people. There will be special
conveyances.
A.M.P. head-office smOke-concert on 24th ultimo went
off very well—songs, recitations and an “Assurance”
farce, by a member, filling the printed bill. Mr. R. Grant
gave a spirited rendering of “Thy Sentinel am I,” and
Mr. R. Teece recited in good style. These musical smokes
are a convivial symptom of the A.M.P.
Lord Jersey will preside at N. S. AY. Art Society's

At Glen limes the other week Miss Flora Vincent, eldest
daughter of Mr. Henry C. Vincent, of the local Examiner,
Avas firmly tied up to Mr. Arthur Kershaw, of Sydney, at
the unearthly hour of 8 a.m. The bride wore ivory white
silk with bouquet of choice bridal blooms and a diamond
bangle, the gift of the bridegroom. Melbourne honey-
moon.
We believe that Marshall’s Tonic Nervine
is the best, as surely as we know it is the original

The Review of Reviews declares The
Bulletin to be “ wicked.” Envious Stead ! He
can only make money by being good.
R. Burdett Smith, C.M.G. (N.S.W.), is, it
is cabled, to be knighted. The Bulletin hopes
this is true, its one aim being to see the knightly
office dignified.
Some of the Australian dailies argue that
the third party in the N.S.W. Legislature can
never attain its ends, and cite the comparative
failure of the Parnellites in the House of Com-
mons, the Local Option party in various legisla-
tures, and the R.C. party of O’Shanassy, in Vic-
toria, in proof of the statement. The position of
the N.S. Wales Labour-party is not on all-fours
with that of any of the cliques referred to, who, in
every case, only represented a small section of
out-door public opinion and had to fight anta-
gonistic governments and oppositions, inside.
The new N.S.W. party, on the contrary, represents
the opinions of the majority outside the N.S.W,
Assembly and, inside, every member is pledged to
uphold nearly all the measures they advocate.
Their mission is, therefore, not one of internal or
external propaganda, it is simply to accomplish
the community’s determination to have reforms
legalised whose justice all, save bigots, admit;
measures the people saw ho likelihood of obtaining
while the ins and outs wasted the country’s time
in an endless struggle for place, to the utter
neglect of all real business. The Labour-party are
not hunting for billets; they are striving after
long-demanded, long-desired legislation; if they
keep this end in view it must be attained. They
are simply a new force for compelling the cum-
brous parliamentary machine to perform its work.
The fall of the Bank of Van Diemen’s
Land is due purely to silver-share-gamble over-
drafts. The bank will now have silver-scrip to
sell by the cwt. The reported overdrafts read
sensationally—one Hobart firm, £80,000; another,
£40,000; Zeehan (silver district) branch, £36,000,
one firm of brokers there being £9000 “ beyond
the constable,” and a Hobart firm of brokers,
£6000. Altogether the bank advanced £1,030,763;
how much to “good marks” is uncertain. The
capital of the bank is £540,000—paid up, £250,000;
reserve liability, £250,000; reserve fund, £40,000.
The last half-yearly report (June 16) showed coin
and bullion only to the extent of £70,432, while its
debts to the public alone were £950,319, its total
liabilities being £1,257,033, against which it relied
on the advances already mentioned, and bills and
debts due by other banks. The directors re-
ported a profit available for distribution
of £18,714, and declared a dividend of 9 per
cent., free of dividend tax; added £2000 to
reserve ; and carried forward, £5042. The sudden
demand to pay up will probably break several
big firms, and these will re-act on a shoal of small
storekeepers; otherwise the depositors will not
suffer, though the shareholders are likely to be
pushed. The other banks are holding off. The
closure is a telling illustration of the privileges
chartered banks obtain from the community, and
affords reason for examining the arguments
concerning the establishment of a State Bank,
even if all the existing charters to banks of issue
have to bo annulled and the financial corporations
become mere money-lending agencies.

“The Profligate,” it is understood, was
written by Pinero, in reply to critics who stated
that he was incapable of evolving a high-class
serious play. Surely no one who has been
able to sit out this prolonged sob, will tempt
the author, by repeating the statement to pen
another theatrical vindication of his claims to
rank among the serious writers. It seems to us,
moreover, that his time might have been more
profitably occupied in writing sermons for barren-
brained parsons, for to our irreverent mind this
play is the most lugubrious and lachyrmose of
maudlin and modern stage-weeps. Its senti-
ment is false, sickly and gushy; its pathos is
hysterical and lacks the convincing ring of the
genuine article. There isn’t a healthy flesh-and-
blood man or woman in it. Instead it is per-
vaded by atrabilious spectres who shriek and sigh,
gasp and groan, preach and pose, through four
weary acts of histrionic neuralgia. Furthermore, it
is unfortunate that all the leading impersonators
of play, at Sydney Garrick, are over-
much given to preaching at the best of times.
Finding in it much room for the exercise of this
unfortunate propensity, they let themselves go
with such zeal that one almost expects the ushers
to take up a collection during each interval.
* * *
All the long-absent artistes Avere warmly
received by a packed house on opening-night
Avhen Olga Nethersole and Charles Cartwright
received numerous “ calls ” after each act. Per-
haps we have been spoiled by Sara and Sardou,
but the dainty little lady seemed to gasp more
persistently, to turn her a’s into e’s more fre
quently and to declaim the most conversational of
remarks more vigorously than ere her departure.
Nevertheless, her copious weeping during the last
two acts, like her joyful gasping during the first
two, Avas rapturously received. CartAvright’s
profligate Avas undoubtedly well played, but he was
too loud for this little theatre, and at times the
show assumed the aspect of a contest between lie
and Cautley as to Avho should rant in the highest
key. The latter, hoAvever, has an unfair advan-
tage, his raving and sobbing commences with the
first act, Avhile Cartwright’s opportunities, in
those directions, are confined to the third and final
acts. Young Cosgrove, much improved as an
actor, also wails vigorously during the later acts,
as does Mary Kingsley; Avhile Nellie Lyons (a
great favourite Avho hasn’t been seen in Sydney
since she played in “The Middleman”) is
lachrymose and limp from ring-up to ring-down.
A very faint touch of comedy is supplied by Frank
Cates (as a travelled rake, on the lines of his Major
Tarver in “ Dandy Dick ”), and by A. C. Poulton,
as a loAv-comedy valet. Harold Russell re-appears
in a small part, and the occasion was made interest-
ing to a certain section of people by the appearance
of Miss Constance Edwards, a Sydney amateur,
daughter of a local lady critic, in the ranks of pro-
fessional theatricals. “The Profligate,” well-
staged and very Avell played, has some strong
situations and many beautiful lines, but, to our
mind, lacks much that is necessary to ensure
popularity.

“Honest Hearts and Willing Hands ” has
struck Sydney at a mighty cold season. In the
first place, Sara Bernhardt has elevated the
standard of judgment to a hitherto unattained
altitude, and brawn has thereby suffered when
brought into direct comparison Avith brains; next,
the management shut out the unthinking who
might have filled the galleries by an uncalled-for
rise in prices; lastly, a name without something
to back it up Avon’t draAv in Australia worth a
cent. Folks who would gladly have paid a round
sum to see one of the greatest sluggers the Avorld
ever produced performing professionally don’t feet
the least curiosity to see him in the role
of the Avorld’s worst actor, and their common-
sense and artistic perception is, doubtless, most
laudable. Indeed, it would have been just one
whit more ridiculous to have expected Sullivan to
have filled the Town Hall by his performance of
an organ solo. Therefore is the atmosphere chilly
at Her Majesty’s, particularly in the vicinity of
the treasury. Everyone must sympathise with
the disappointed stranger in a far land, and there-
fore Duncan B. Harrison, who is a good and
genial fellow, deserves to be let down lightly;
nevertheless, it must be said that his play, Avritten
on the lines of the conventional Irish drama, is
not artistically designed for the introduction of a
slugging-match. The boxer and the tussle are too
palpably Avedged into the story. The fight should
have been made the culminating feature of the
plot. A play might have been written showing
now pugilists are reared and trained. First act:
Sullivan leaving his Irish home with all his goods
and chattels in a red handkerchief; second
act, arrival in America, followed by a quarrel
with his senior in the police, and dismissal
after putting the inspector to sleep ; third
act, Sullivan’s training quarters—with stoutly-
resisted temptations at the hands of amorous
duchesses, the entreaties of a lovely and pious
colleen, champagne-bearing dudes and bribe-
bringing bookmakers; fourth and final act, the
ring-side at early morn, the bottle-holders, the
referee, with loud thuds, splashes of gore, the
cries of “books” and yells of backers, then the
triumph of Sullivan, and the joy of the loving and

mighty glad to keep out of their way. But as the
fightisn't worked up to and doesn’t last long and
Xthe audience know that it is “a put-up job, it
fails to arouse any enthusiasm. The author has a
good stage presence, and speaks_ cleaily and
forcibly, but kills himself by the delivery of lay
sermons. ‘ ‘ Jack ” Sweeney plays a sil very-toned
Hibernian tenor, a part resembling Myles na-
Coppaleen. Madge Seymour is his Colleen Bawn,
and Edith Blande a sort of Ann Chute, but
Harry Jewett’s villain is the only thoroughly
well-acted part throughout, while the Michael
Feeneyish McNab of W. P She don, a new
comer, furnished the only legitimate reasons for
laughter. The management have now come down
to ordinary prices, but, fearing that the drop
Smi So K the “ Merry Wives” ,s staged on
Saturday, with Harry Jewett m G. R. s original

of the Melbourne season.

One feature of the Bernhardt season nas been
the manner in which the artful James has caused
the waits to be filled up with high-class music,
rendered by a strong orchestra. Ihese waits, by
the way, are chiefly caused by the filtering behind
of purring old tabbies, lisping dudes, and tame-
cat critics, who hinder the divine Sara from com-
posing her nerves and changing duds. Another
feature of the Bernhardt season is that the audi-
torium lights are never lowered during the per-
formance. This greatly assists those who study
French by book, but is bad for the eye-
sight of those who study it by means of
opera-glass. “Theodora” has undoubtedly re-
vived the waning glories of Sara’s sea-
son She fetches them in it all the
time. Darmont, as Andreas, has come out of his
shell and shown an unexpected vigour, earnest-
ness, and ease. It is better and more harmoniously
dressed and wigged than anything they’ve yet
staged, and the freshness of the scenery, by
Goatcher, Hennings, Grist, and Clint, though
admittedly hurriedly prepared, is a relief after the
cracks and crumples of the much-travelled French
stuff. After five nights of “Theodora,” at the
Royal, “La Tosca ” was revived on Wednesday
night; “Pauline Blanchard” goes up again to-
night (Thursday), “La Tosca” again on Friday
night, and “ Camille ’’ ends the Bernhardt Sydney
season, one of her most wonderful triumphs in a
small city. As previously announced, she sails
for America in the Mariposa, and “The Old
Guard,” with the music of Planquette and the
words of Farnie, fills the bill on Monday.

At Sydney Criterion our old friend, “Dr.
Bill,” seems quite as popular as of yore, for, up to
date, S.R.O. business has prevailed. In many
places the author has been unproved on by the
filling in of gaps and the spicing of weak situa-
tions, chiefly at the hands of George Anson, who,
however, repeats his “at the age of thirty-five
years ” speech just a little too often. The only
change from the original cast lies in the substitu-
tion of George Gordon for Mr. Clitherow. Pos-
sibly, the show goes better now than ever, though
occasionally it shows a tendency to subside after
a disconcerting, if mirth-arousing, gag has broken
the thread of discourse. Myra Kemble’s per-
formance is a great improvement on her original
effort; she has worked in many little strokes of
telling business, but has occasionally some
moments when she appears to have run down.
All the other folks, from “Bob” Brough to
Brenda Gibson, shine with B. & B.’s best theatri-
cal gloss, and half the good things are drowned in
the laughter rising from the auditorium.

When Bridget O’Brien, Esq., winds up a
most successful season at Adelaide Royal, up goe s
“Les Cloches de Corneville,” with Johnny Sheri-
dan as Gaspard, Warwick Gainor as the Marquis,
Gracie Whiteford as Serpolette, and Annie
Nelson, a local songstress, as Germaine. This
will close the season. Tommy Hudson is not
getting tired of making money at Garner’s Rooms,
and surrounded by a capable company he
is likely to do well till his departure for India in
September. Tanner goes on with his fast, and
the Cyclorama is still an attraction. Achurch-
Charrington Co. are at Broken Hill putting in a
week. The success of the Patey season was inter-
fered with by Madame catching a bad cold.

“The Dancing Girl” thrives no better
than was expected at Melbourne Royal. Why
H. A. Jones’s beautifully varnished work should
fall so flat is a question which the local critics
answer in about 15 different ways, yet a fair,
rough and ready explanation of the trouble seems
to stick right out. The play ruthlessly exposes
all the weakness of the company, whilst individual
performers caricature several unnatural features
of the play. Save for a superabundance of cheap
philosophy, the dialogue is equal to the author’s
reputation. “Don’t preach at me,” says the dook
as he carefully poses Ids noble proportions upon a
lump of his sea-girt domains. “I won’t—l will
wait till you are under the horse’s hoofs,” replies
the morbid young Sybil with the game leg. But
a lot of preaching goes on, nevertheless, the Dook
of Gooseberry (called Guiseberry, by mistake)
being the most inveterate sermonizer of the whole
crowd. There can be no doubt that the two stars
are mainly responsible for the sum total of dull-
ness, although minor offenders contribute
according to their means. Miss Laura Villiers
is an unattractive actress, intelligent, but
devoid of charm a crude, thin, restless
suggestion of Genevieve Ward without the
mellow tones or nervous force of that
remarkable woman. It is soul, rather than art,
which Miss Villiers lacks, though to be sure she
is unintentionally pathetic when she throws up
her arms and cries, “ I must have my public to
worship me.” They don’t worship her, dash it
all ! The lady is never absurd, however, now
that her moonlight dance has been mercifully
withdrawn from circulation. Three or four pro-
miscuous whirls were all she did last Saturday,
instead of repeating her former painful struggles
to afford the dook a fleeting glimpse of her stock-
ing. This amendment robs the young Quaker’s
conundrum, “Woman, what art thou?” of much
significance, and causes the curta n to descend
without a smile. One feels sorry that the old
dance has been abandoned, because it was so good
for the liver—the audience’s liver. It was, indeed.
Clifton Alderson, as the gigantic gooseberry,
improves very little on acquaintance. Poor
houses and indifferent notices have toned him
down, and imparted a touch of melancholy to his
evening-party manner, but Clifton is still very
much on the surface. His desperate resolve to
commit suicide is as hollow as his airy abandon.
Also his personal beauty and swelling bosom are
unsuited to the peerage, although they qualify
him to give a magnificent performance of a
heroic shop-walker. There is nothing of the
unsophisticated islander about Julius Knight,
who plays an Adam Bede character in a
thoroughly town-bred, yet bright and manly,
style. The Dancing Girl’s aged parent is much
overweighted with his woe, and another painful
apparition is the dock’s chum, a young chappie
worthy to be promptly interred in the same sar-
cophagus as the dock’s aunt. Auntie is really
too dreadful under present circumstances. _ Pro-
vidence has afflicted her with a falsetto voice of
extended range, and unless the management can
throw in a song and dance for Gooseberry’s blood
relation, or persuade her to cork her face, she
had better retire on a pension forthwith. Miss
Gwendolen Floyd, as the lame Sybil, shows no
indications of being other than a moderate actress
in a winsome part, whilst the balance —excepting,
perhaps, old Crake and an exaggerated flunkey—
seem incapable of proving moderate in any parts.
A newspaper correspondence re the quality of
Miss Villiers & Co. may serve to arouse popular
interest in their dire failure, and so prolong the
run of “The Dancing Girl.” At time of writing,
however, a new piece was in rehearsal for
Saturday next.

“Huy Bias ” is negotiating its sixth lap at
the Princess’, and attendances, which dropped off
during three nights when Nellie Farren was
absent, have bobbed up again with much of their
old serenity. Nellie’s understudy, Miss Ethel
Blenheim, was not an exhilarating change. The
difference she made to the ensemble ought to prove
instructive to a number of young people who don’t
appreciate the amount of burlesque experience
and real brain capital that the evergreen Farren
puts into Gaiety business. The lengthening of
the present season to 12 weeks has not yet been
arranged with manager Edwardes, of London, but
“ Cinder-Ellen ” —a more gorgeous show, in the
matter of scenery and properties, than any opera
or pantomime yet staged under Williamsonian
management—may be seen anon, anyway.

“Peril,” at Melbourne Bijou, comes a
little nearer to the French original than our old
familiar “ Friends,” but one adaptation of Sardou
is sufficiently like the other to make very little
difference. The dangers of Platonic attachments
between young wives and bachelor captains are
fully exposed in “ Perillikewise the absurdity
of a trusting husband who seems to glory in being
insulted by his circle of acquaintances is depicted
with a free hand. Unfortunately, the play
wobbles between the sublime and the ridiculous,
and at the finish one gropes in vain for its moral
lesson. There is not a genuine ring about the
narrative at all, for the chief characters do impos-
sibly apropos things at critical moments. It is a
farcical tragedy in four acts, beautifully mounted,
well acted, and rounded off with a dead hare.
Titheradge comes well to the fore as Dr. Thornton,
the cynic who looks faithfully after the interests
of his soft-headed host and listens at the keyhole
whilst his hostess is being chased round the
library by the lover she has fooled into false hopes.
Boucicault, as a sort of titled Gunnion, making
himself “ darned unpleasant ” on principle, is very
funny, and a cantankerous couple of friends
are thoroughly well played by Lawrence and Miss
Romer. Lyndal, too, is a fairly convincing, and
certainly handsome, picture of the seductive senti-
mentalist, whose rash pursuit of a shadow gives
the play its name ; but Sass is cruelly placed as
soft-headed Sir George Ormond. His attempt to
seem ingenuously simple is bright and pleasant
enough, yet it can’t be taken quite seriously,
because he ain’t built that way. Mrs, Brough
comes well through the furnace in her trying
character of Lady Ormond without making the
very most of her opportunities in the love-chase
scene, and Miss Spong is delightful as her step-
daughter. No notice of a Bijou show should
forget to tip the stage servants, who are always
first quality at this house. MHntyre is the most
finished specimen of a “ gentleman’s-gentleman ”
that ever brushed a coat behind the footlights.
“ Peril ” should last over another week, anyhow.

A look of dull despair has come over the
Opera House. The mechanical race scene con-
tinues to go off like an alarm clock at 10.30, but
interest in “The County Fair” has gone off once
and for all. The local press-liars, too, seem to
ignore the MacMahons and their brilliant enter-
prises now that the brethren have reduced their
advt. to two inches, and the average newspaper
reader must sometimes wonder why “The County
Fair” doesn’t get the puff paragraphs that were
erstwhile wasted on weaker entertainments at the
same house. The Macs have not been lucky with
their Murr’kan play, which would be by no means
bad if it were not for the race-scene, by which
alone it is judged. No matter, the last nights of
Mif 9 Prue, Tag'gs, and that dear boy Otis are
announced, and the free-list is entirely suspended.

The Italian Opera season opens at the
Alexandra on Saturday (Bth). All the dress-circle ■
and reserved stall seats for the first night were
bought up in a great hurry, so it seems likely that
a large portion of the big house will have to be set
apart for rank and fashion before the curtain
ascends on “11 Trovatore. ”

Coppin has one great virtue—he likes old faces, and it
is probable that some of his old people will com© up again
now that Melbourne Royal is under his law. Mrs. W.

It is a shudderful fact that Alf. Boothman might have
found a watery grave in the Melbourne flood, but didn’t.
Early on that memorable Sabbath morning Mr. and Mrs.
B. were aroused from slumber by a gondolier tilting the
butt-end of his merry bark against their bedroom window
and recommending them to be rowed away ere it was too
late. “For in that sleep of death what dreams may
come,” shouts the gondolier, being aware that the re-
nowned hactor is “nuts” on “Hamlet,” to which Alf.
replied—“ Once aboard the lugger, all is well,” and pre-
pared to turn his military back upon the old, old home he
loved so well. There wasn’t much time to spare, unfor-
tunately. The pond was rising rapid ly, and Alf. was only
able to pack up Mrs. Boothmai, a tooth-brush, and half-a-
dozen pet canaries, or so, before the gallant craft shoved
off and carried them o’er the murky bosom of the aquatic
carnival to a dry place. Alfred the Great was saved!
George Coppin, gazing aghast at the first performance

Joseph Knight, the critic, once sat between Sara Bern-

several members of the “ Comytee de receptione.”
A Melbourne paper avers that Bernhardt lives rent-free
at Sydney’s Australia. This, if true—which it probably
isn’t—is a delicate compliment that will be appreciated at
its full yalue by J. C. Williamson.
It is said that a high-placed Adelaidean church dignitary

What sickened Coppin of acting was his Adelaide recep*

“ Experience in all branches of the profession.” Such

George Rignold will be heartily welcomed in Melbourne,
and there is every sign that the Royal will soon be

“How did Coppin acquire his nickname of ‘Artful
Dodger?’” It was through acting in a farce of that
name, and the last time was at Melbourne Royal, when
he and Mrs. Bryer sang and danced the ever-popular
duct, “ The best of all possible Dod-ges !” Coppin’s great
songs were “ Yilikins," “ Constantinople,” and “ Old
Dog Tray.”

to sail for London where they open in September.
Twinning wants to know if Australia thinks Sara a copy

On the last night of “ Flying from Justice,” at Sydney
Royal, the actor-manager, George Rignold, gagged right
through the piece. Appearing in the forgers’ den, he was
asked by Tolano ; “ Who are you ? ” to which he replied :
“ I am John L. Sullivan ! ” and, Tolano looking surprised,
followed that up by saying: “ Don’t be frightened, I only
say that to mugs.”
There is much sympathy with David Lee, Melbourne
city organist, over the unexpected death of his wife,

Dampier issues a creditable manifesto, closing the

Florence Levey, danseuse, Letty Lind's substitute in

A certainly talented actress and her somewhat less,

skipped, leaving a lot of little debts behind. This reminds
us anent the alleged wedding of Kyrle Bellew (who

her Potter) in Hong Kong, that Cora, a hard nail and as
close-fisted as they make ’em, will now wear the pants

Sydney Daily Telegraph’s average cir-
culation is certified as 35,092. Now, Alfred !

Parkes appears to have given 10 grs. of
strychnine in advance to his Electoral Act Amend-
ment Bill. The 53rd section makes it unlawful to
keep open any public-house on the day of polling.
As this constitutes an important amendment to
the Licensing Act, it appears outside the title and
scope of the Electoral Bill which it is contended
will have to be withdrawn and amended.
On the first day of term the N.S.W-
judges dolled themselves up in the most nonsensi'
cally gorgeous millinery—scarlet and ermine,
black and gold, and scarlet and mauve, but all the
Queen’s Counsel were absent—we hope, as an ex-
pression of disgust. Two ladies sat in the jury-
box, evidently much awed by the barbaric
grandeur in which this set of very commonplace
peojfft (the weakest bench in Australia, probably)
had tricked themselves out. The less brains a
man has, the more clothes he needs. The Full
Court, instead of dressing itself up as if for a
feast of long-pig at the Court of King Calcali of
Ashantee, should have come out into King-street
in sackcloth and ashes and gone down on its
narrowbones to do public penance for its wooden-
headed decision in the recent appeal-case of Dr
McLeod.
Parkes’ apparent contemplated treachery
to the cause of one-man-one-vote nearly ship-
wrecked his Ministry. Notwithstanding the fre-
quent visits of Bruce Smith to the Labour-party’s
“caucus,” the amendment, which affirmed that
womanhood-suffrage should remain in abeyance
until political equality was conferred upon the
country’s manhood, was defeated by 49 to 41.
The amendment was accepted as a vote of censure
by Parkes, but nevertheless the Ministry was un-
usually active in canvassing the help of the Labour-
party ; and Bruce Smith apparently expected great
difficulty in inducing sufficient Labour members
to vote against Fitzgerald's amendment to save
the Ministry from a humiliating defeat on a
“fad.” It was managed with some dexterity, for
just before the tellers were named, the numbers,
instead of standing at ayes 41, noes 49, stood at
ayes 47, noes 43. Six members, chiefly “ Labour
members,” as if by a preconcerted arrangement,
crossed over to the “ noes ” as the Speaker rose to
name the tellers. The debate on Parkes abstract
motion cost £2BO in members’ allowances alone.
Is Parkes’ championship of womanhood suffrage
ruled by the lady that “rocks the cradle” at
Hampton Cottage? He is encouraging the idea
that his Ministry is a one-man Ministry, and that
that man is very much under petticoat govern-
ment.
In The Bulletin’s opinion, the N.S.W.
Labour-party made its first big political mistake
when it tolerated, without r -snonstrance, the
appointment of Dan O’Conr r to the Upper
House, in face of the fact that) he had been twice
rejected by popular constituencies. The Bul-
letin would not object, under existing circum-
stances, to the nomination to the Legislative
Council of a politician who had many times been
elected to the Assembly, and whose connection
with the representative chamber, as in Mr.
O’Connor’s case, had been severed through no
disgraceful or corrupt act; but it emphatically
protests against any executive officer of the Gov-
ernment being sent to the Upper House after he
has lost the confidence of the Assembly electors.
When Parkes said he didn’t appoint O’Connor
“ until he saw that he had a majority in the Assem-
bly,’’the Labour-party (through whose supporters
O’Connor had been kept out of the Lower House)
should have told him then and there that he had
no majority without them, and that, as he had'
not consulted them, it was impudent for him to
presume on their approval. Parkes, it is true,
might have resigned on this, but then he is
obviously seeking a dramatic opportunity for
making a temporary retirement, and it is quite
unlikely that he would accept this as a resignation
pretext, considering how loudly he had opposed
the nomination of Suttor under similar condi-
tions, and how undemocratic was his side of the
present case.

No. XI.—“Benefit o’ Clargy Bill.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
One November day, in one of the earlier-
years of the reign of His Most Excellent Majesty
the Fourth George, the Court of King’s Bench*
Westminster, was presided over by Mr. Justica
Bayley. Three other ennined creatures kept his
Lordship company, but with them we have
nothing to do.
The case before the court is that of William
Henry Ellis, who was convicted at the last Devoir
assizes of having stolen six shillings, the property
of Susan Newman, widow, in whose employ he
had been tvs shopman. .
That an offence which, though capital, stillto>
that enlightened age appeared a paltry one, shouldl
come before the august King’s Bench, was a fact
so curious as to need some preliminary explana-
tion.
The explanation is to be found in the circum-
stance that, in the first count of the indictment,,
the prisoner was charged with stealing “ the?
property of Susan Newman,” and in the secondl
count, with stealing “ the property of Susan
Newman and the different members of her family.”'
Now, notwithstanding that Ellis had descended!
to petty pilferings, he had not been deserted by ,
all his friends. Some of them briefed counsel to
argue in favour of upsetting the conviction.
Mr. Chitty and Mr. Coleridge were his counsel,
and they made a strenuous effort to arrest judg-
ment. For four hours they battled bra vely against
the prosecution and the court. But their labour
was unavailing. After consulting with his brother
Lordships, Judge Bayley pronounced against
them, and sentenced the prisoner “to be trans-
ported beyond the seas for the term of seven years,
to such place as His Majesty, by and with the
advice of his Privy Council, shall be pleased to
direct and appoint; and that, in the meantime,
he shall be committed to the custody of the keeper
of His Majesty’s Gaol at Newgate.”
This was sufficiently satisfactory so far as it all
went. So, at least, the prisoner thought as with a
sigh so deep in its relieved breathing that it ex-
pressed the sudden relaxation of an extreme
tension of feeling. He had expected to be hanged,
he remarks as he passes dazedly from the bar.
But stay ! There is still time for him to be sen-
tenced to death. He is called back by his Honor
Judge Bayley, and he tremblingly resumes the
place where he has stood for four hours past, and
waits for his Lordship to speak.
“You have been brought back, prisoner, because
—h’m —ah —a slight omission has been made.”
The prisomr heard as though he heard not, for
his recall to the bar had driven him again into au
agony o c despair.
“ Mr. Clerk,” continued the Judge, “call upon
the prisoner.”
Mr. Dealton, clerk, obeyed. “Prisoner, ishab
have you to say why the Court should not pro-
ceed to pass judgment of death, and award execu-
tion against you ? ”
Ellis stammered, “Sir —I don’t—l don t
know. I —I— ” .
“ Leave it to your counsel,” whispered some
one in the public seats, in pity for the prisoner’s
too obvious distress.
“ I —leave it —to my counsel —my Lord 1” tho
accused at last managed to say.
“ No, your counsel can do nothing for you!”
declared the presiding judge.
But Coleridge iiad murmured a hint while the
Judge was speaking. “ Kneel, kneel, and pray
for the benefit of clergy !”
And Ellis mechanically knelt, and prayed tho
benefit of clergy. He did not know the signifi-
cance of the words —that was plain from his con-
fused utterance; but they served to turn the
hangman's hand aside for the time being.
For the Court allowed him the “ benefit of
clergy,” and instead of hanging him by the neck
till ho was dead, consented to repeat its former
verdict, and accordingly confirmed its order for
transportation.
» • #
That was the first occasion on which Ellis
pleaded the benefit of clergy. Ho pleaded it
again at the Antipodes later.
He “ went out ”in the Minstrel. His record on
board was “fair.” Chained for the best part of
each day of the voyage to a brother-transport and
the deck —the Surgeon of the Minstrel was
esteemed a splendid fellow by the Superintendent
of the Transport Office, because he was an excel-
lent disciplinarian—he had no opportunity of
indulging his pilfering tastes. This circumstance
was somewhat unfortunate for him, as, had he
been granted a chance of stealing frequently and
regularly, there is not the least reason to suppose
the Surgeon would have neglected to treat him as
he had treated at least one other similarly in-
clined. Had lie been “hanged at the yard-arm
for manifesting incurable thievish habits,” to use
the Surgeon’s phrase in the indent of a former
voyage, William Henry Ellis would have been
saved much suffering and not a little crime. Even
Captain Maconoohie, tenderest-hearted of penal
administrators, considered it was the truest mercy
to hang some men. Ellis was one such. He
should, in his own interests, have been hanged
before he was.
For the cause stated, however, his ship-record
was “ fair.” He was not of a violent temper, and
would submit to any amount of oppression, legal
or other, before he would resist. Hence, he did
not form a member of the class who “ ovalled ”
their irons when they should have kept them per-
fect, who struck their officials when they should
have saluted them, and who raised hideous noises
when silence was imperative. He was a pilferer,
not a mutineer; thievish, but not otherwise
insuliordiuate. Consequently, we say, his record
was fair.
On rare occasions the possession of a “fair”
record proved an advantage to a transport; on
many, a positive disadvantage.
In this way. When the transports were
mustered on landing by the Honourable the
Colonial Secretary, the list of “availables for
assignments ” would be made out. Tho official
families had first pick, and, naturally enough,
they would snap up the individuals with the fair
and good reports. And, nine times out of ten, to
be assigned to an official, was to be signed to a
capricious and tyrannical employer. Generally
speaking, there was only one worse person to be
under than an official—and that was the illiterate
Emancipist. The former from a sense of absolute
and irresponsible power; the latter, from innate
brutality, or tire idea of revenging upon somebody
the injuries he had himself received from the
System, were, by every principle of humanity,
ineligible for holding assigned hands. And, there-
fore, so beautifully was the System elaborated,
the percentage of assignments to them was larger
than to free settlers.
Now, Ellis, per Minstrel, having a fair report,
and Major Ovens being, admittedly, one of the
most brilliant officials of an epoch which was
adorned by General Darling, Dr. Douglass, Saxe
Bannister, and other gentry of like kidney, the
Fates, of course, ordained that unto Major Ovens,
should be assigned transport Ellis. A kind but
firm master might have saved Ellis : a master who
was firm to the degree of brute obstinacy, and who
constantly acted up to his magisterial declaration
“ that a convict’s feelings could not be considered,
because every convict was dead in law ” could
only be expected to “break” him. And break
him he did most effectually.
« * «
“ You’re a petty thief, then, are you,
Ellis?” said Ovens. “ Now, my man, I want you
as a stableman and you’ll have the best opportuni-
ties for stealing. Steal if you like! I lock noth-
ing up in my house —every assigned servant I have
can rob me as much as he or she likes. But look
ye here, pris’ner! For every pen’orth of food
wasted or property stolen, I give a lash ! That’s
my rule, Ellis, and I’m a man o’ my word. Now,
ye know, my man—a lash for a pen’orth with a
minimum of twenty, I’m not vindictive —I might
.give a dozen, but I only give twenty. If you must

steal —and once a thief always a thief is my
experience—for your own sake steal at least twenty-
pence worth, for you’ll never get a stripe less than
a score. Mark ye that!”
“ I do, sir !” Ellis sainted with the chill of a
fear biting into his heart, for —God help him !
lie must steal ! He knew it- he could not help
himself —and as Ovens had been so explicit, his
flesh crept in anticipation of the floggings to
come.
“ Not vindictive!” he cried to himself as he set
about his first job in his master’s stabloyard.
“ He'll only give twenty, when he might give a
dozen. He’s a joking devil, he is, as if a score
ain’t more than a dozen.”
Ho was right enough in affirming that Ovens
was a joking devil, but, as a new-arrival, he bad
yet to learn that at Botany Bay a dozen (of lashes)
included five more than a score.
# # *
The manner of his learning ifc was as
follows :
For a fortnight he successfully struggled against
numerous temptations literally thrown in his way.
Loaves of bread, lumps of meat, fragments of
soap, even a flask of rum, had been frequently
placed to his hand, to say nothing of the hundred
and one articles of a stable and harness-room equip-
ment which it was possible for him to appropriate
and sell. And with respect to all and each he had
remained honest.
But, one Sunday morning, shortly after the
dawn of a spring day sun, penetrating through
tho cracks in the weatherboards of the stable-loft,
had chased the drowsiness from his eyes, Ellis
arose —and fell. Beside him, on the deck of the
loft, and within a foot of the straw-filled tick,
which, unsupported by a bedstead, served him for
a resting-place, lay a plug of tobacco. It was not
in the convict nature to resist that bribe. In half
the time it takes to pen the words descriptive of
the action, a finger’s-breadth of the weed was in
his mouth.
“ Ha, ha !” laughed a merry-toned voice. “ Ho,
ho, my man ! Better chew the whole plug now.
It’s a dozen I’ll give you for the plug, and twenty
for the bit, so, if I were you, I’d take the lot.”
The voice was that of Major John Ovens,
Acting-Chief Engineer, bosom friend of Judge-
Advocate Bent, and trusted functionary of His
Britannic Majesty and H.B.M.’s satraps Brisbane
and Darling. And it proceeded from a corner of
the loft where, under a heap of warm hay, that
worthy gentleman had ensconced himself.
“I’ll teach you to be honest, my man ! Nobody
shall stay in my employ unless he’s honest. And
you’re going to stay in my employ. You don t
like me, my man, and that's the reason I’m going
to keep you. I always keep a man who hates me.
I break him or make him.”
“ Are you a—man—sir ? ” stammered the
transport.
“Ha, ha! good fellow! Not a man merely,
but an officer, sir, and a gentleman, by virtue of
His Majesty’s Commission—ha, ha ! ”
“ By the (Commission of Beelzebub, you mean !’
cried the maddened convict, who was not as yet
used to Major Ovens’ playful little way of treating
everything, even human backs and hearts, as a
joke. “You’re a devil, sir—and a spy—a —
peaching cull, sir.”
Ovens had drawn himself erect, and smiling the
while, was plucking the straws from the shabby
undress jumper and trowsers he had worn as his
night-gear. But Ellis’ reckless words banished
the smile. There was a grim fact in his career of
which the term “spy” unpleasantly reminded.
His voice cooled to the cuttingest of accents as he
rejoined.
“ There, that will do. Polish the harness, get
your breakfast and prepare for whipping at eight
o’clock. Are you a raw ’un ? ”
“ What’s that ? And you can’t flog me without
bringing me before a magistrate!”
“Tut, tut, can’t I? I’m a magistrate. Why,
7could hang you. There’s only one other man
besides the Governor who could do that straight
off! Would you like me to try ?”
The pleasant temper of the Major was re-
asserting itself. He was becoming jocose again.
Still, though approaching jocularity, he was
speaking the truth. Johnston of Annandale and
himself could hang without trial. We will tell
you some day bow tin's power of high justice was
conferred and exorcised.
Transport Ellis was deceived by the Major’s
resumed jocoseness of tone. He thought he was
not so offended as he seemed. So, though his
every nerve was quivering with the fear of the
threatened punishment, he, too, Iried to smile.
“Try, if you like. I’d as lief be hanged as
whipped, or lead this dog’s life.”
“Gad, I will try! Go down, pris’ner, to the
yard and prepare for death—h’m —hanging.”
“God ! d'ye mean it, sir?”
“I’m a man of my word as I’ve already told
you, pris’ner. Go down ! ” He pushed Ellis
down the ladder, and the poor wretch, thoroughly
unnerved, fell at its foot.
“ Get up ! ” ordered Ovens. Ellis’ only response
was a moan. His head beat on the cobble-stones,
two or three feet inside the stable-door.
Ovens passed out.
* # #
An English oak—planted, so the legend
ran, by Captain King—was burgeoning its twenty
years’ growth of trunk and limb with the symbols
of the new Spring. In the Autumns, its leaves
fell on the gables of the stable, so close was it to
the building. Only, one limb stretched out, four-
teen feet from the ground, over the carriage path-
way.
Ovens whistled. Half-a dozen heads protruded
from as many windows or doors.
“ Here, Mottram—Pike—Hughes, reeve a rope
on the gallows-tree and stand by to haul. Pris’ner
Ellis here does not think I’ve power to scrag him.”
With hands at the salute as they ran, the three
assigned men named hurried to the stable.
There was an expertness about their movements
which betokened a shameful familiarity with the
routine of the ceremony.
One hauled from under the eaves a long ladder,
which he placed against the projecting arm of the
oak.
A second pulled from a locker in the stable a
tortuous length of rope. The yarn was stained in
places.
The third, as tlje rope was unwound, lifted an
end of it, ran up the ladder, and, more slowly,
moved along the limb. Half its length he paused;
for there hung, by an iron clamp, a pulley-block.
He passed the rope on the sheave. “ Will that do,
y’r Honor ?” he respectfully asked. The Major
nodded affirmatively. Of course it would do!
Why shouldn’t it ? Had not Hughes reeved tho
rope once or twice before, and, therefore, did he
not know all about the way of doing it ?
The rope-ends dangled, and swung loosely in
the breeze. The noosed end was tho first to still
in its pendulous movement.
“ Now, Ellis, say a prayer, and get ready !”
The fellow, with his head bent between his arms
on the cobble-stones, shook, but did not answer.
“ Get up, Ellis !” Thus Ovens ordered. Still,
no answer.
“ Draw him up !”
Mottram hastened to fling the noose round the
transport’s neck.
Ovens turned to the others. “At the word
haul! ” he said ; but as he uttered the devilish
speech, he exchanged a meaning look with them.
They raised their hands in salute and to signify
they understood. They clasped, one behind the
other, the rope.
“One!” exclaimed the torturer —otherwise the
officer and gentleman.
Mottram and Pike pulled. They hauled Ellis
to his feet —and at the uplifting of the Major’s
hand stopped. Ellis staggered, reeled, thrust his
fingers between the hemp and his neck.
“ Devil!” he gasped.
“ But the Devil isn’t as black as he’s painted !”
said Owens. “P’r’apsthis one isn’t as black as
you think !” He laughed ; he was quite merry
again, quite.
, “What—are you—hanging me for?” the victim
of the torture spluttered, with foam urging itself
between the phrases.
“For fun !” whispered Hughes, who was stand-
ing close to him. “ Shut up. He’ll ’a done soon.”
“ For larceny !” said Ovens.
* * •
Witn eye and ear intent upon his master,
Ellis had not heard the syllables sympathetically
muttered by his fellow-servant. He heard but the
Major’s voice.
“ Larceny!” With a piteous hoarseness he
enunciated the word. The rope was being
tautened,
“Larceny of one plug of tobacco !”
“ Larceny he stopped to get his fingers once
more between the rope and his flesh. “ Larceny !
Then—l—pray—the benefit of clergy.”
He flung himself on the ground ; on his knees ;
his sudden impulse had pulled the line through
the fingers of the unofficial hangmen.
“I—pray—benefit—of clergy !” Ovens mimicked
the speech, and then burst into a roar of laughter.
The joke was rich, superb !
“ Yes, I pray benefit of clergy ! I did at home
—and it saved me !”
The Major, palpitating with his merriment,
assumed once more a sternness of voice.
“ You’ve prayed it once, then ? Don’t ye know
you fool, that you can’t pray it a second
time ! Get ready there again !”
Pike and Mottram tightened their grip.
“Two!”
Once more the “ Condemned ” stood on his
feet—if a reeling position, only maintained to a
degree of crectness by the haulage, could be termed
standing.
“No last dying speech and confession, Ellis?
None? Then (to the men) Three, and a sling. ’
The creatures hauled Ellis swung Ir'gh—re-
volved once, twice— and in obedience to a down-
ward wave of the Major’s hand, was allowed to
run down to the earth again. He fell in a
writhing, groaning, gesticulating heap.
• * •
As for Major Ovens, he was, to use the
expression he himself employed when he told the
story that same afternoon at his own dinner-table,
in “ fits of laughter.”
“The poor sinner actually thought I intended
tie hang him then and there as 1 did ” He
stopped in his recital. The younger generation of
“ free ” colonists was represented at the table and
perhaps that ugly story had better be left untold.
“And what did you do, then? Flog him, of
course ? ” questioned a guest.
“ Well, I couldn’t let the theft of the tobacco
go unpunished. I gave him a dozen—the fool
thought a dozen was tw'elve only.”
“ And what did he do? ”
“Do! Nothing! But he said ”
f “ What, sir ! ”
“ That I’d never rest in my grave. That if no
one else stole my body from its coffin he would ! ”
* # •
On Monday, May 21st, 1827, an
attempt, led by a convict who had been nick-
named “Benefit o’ Clargy Bill,” was made to
remove the remains of the late Major Ovens from
the vault, contiguous to the tomb of Judge-
Advocate Bart, at Garden Island, in which they
were deposited.
The depredators, as Mr. Robert Howe termed
them in the Sydney Gazette, were unsuccessful
in their main object, through a circumstance here-
inafter to be related.
Nevertheless, the prophecy of transport Ellis,
otherwise “ Benefit o’Clargy Bill,” was fulfilled.
Major Ovens’ remains were not allowed to rest on
Garden Island. They repose in St. Leonard’s
Cemetery, North Shore. But the authorities of
the New Regime who ordered their exhumation
and transfer were not, it is to be presumed,
informed of the act of desecration which
accompanied the removal.
Which act had clearly its origin in the pro-
ceedings of that Sunday morning.

N.S.W., was once reported as having “gone
over,” whereupon a Sydney paper came out with
a glowing eulogy of the virtues of the defunct.
But Dangar wasn’t dead and made the newspaper
people stump up over £lO expenses incurred by
him in personally answering consolatory telegrams
addressed to his relatives.
“ Silence ! This is not a theatre ! ” such
was Chief Justice Coleridge’s check to the
applause after the speech of Cumming’s barrister.
But a party at the back said coolly, “ You have
made it so ’’—for there were a score of fashionable
women on the Bench. Edmund Yates slates
Coleridge flayfully, and says he has a document
which can make him wink. We believe this refers
to an alleged breach of promise.
F. Anstey, author of “ Vice Versa,” lately
bought in Baris a book in French, which he
recognised as a straight-out translation of one of
his own works. Ho wrote to the French
“author” praising the book highly and asking
leave to translate it into English. The modest
Frenchman replied that he feared the volume did
not deserve Mr. Anstey’s great praise, and that he
had already published an English translation.
Premier Munro’s monotonous declaration
that he has “ worked harder than any of them ”
(the unemployed) is based upon the dim and dis-
tant fact that he once pulled a press. A specimen
of Munro’s work hangs framed against the wall
of a Melbourne printing-office. It isn’t much for a
man to go blowing about whenever the question
of manual labour crops up. But it is something.
Tlie only specimen of Duncan Gillies’ work that
lias attained to the dignity of a frame is the penny
he lavished upon a waiter, some four or five years
ago.
President Kruger, of the Transvaal Re-
public, was invited to attend a ball in honour of
Queen Victoria’s last -birthday. His secretary
forwarded a reply to the effect that Kruger “con-
siders a bail as Baal’s service, for which reasons
the Lord ordered Moses to kill all the offenders.
Whereas such is, consequently, contrary to His
Honor’s principles, His Honor cannot consent to
the misuse of his name in connection with such a
ball.”
In the diaiy of the late Commodore Good-
enough, it is related that, walking down one of
the streets of a Chinese town one day, the commo-
dore saw two mendispujing violently. Suddenly
they began to fight. One caught the other by the
pigtail, and, holding him firmly, cut his head
clean off his shoulders with a large knife. He
flung the head' in the street, and deliberately
walked away, none of the bystanders attempting
to interfere with him.
Old Mike L , a wealthy Melbourneite,
went to an artist, a dab in oils, for a picture of
“me house, wid meself and phamilee sittifi’ in
front.” The job was done, and Mick didn’t
object to £250, but “ Stay, Misther, fwhat's this ?
Ye’ve painted me wid only one oye.” “Profile,
my dear sir, profile.” “ Profeel be —— 1 I won’t
be painted wid wan oye. Put in the other, and
here’s your money.” The upshot was a county
court case, when the artist won, of course.
Sara Bernhardt receives on an average
from 50 to 60 letters daily, asking advice,
assistance and information. Enraged thereby,
Mme. has made it known through the columns
of a Sydney daily that “ she cannot acknowledge
communications of this nature; that life would
not be worth living beneath the yoke of such
oppressive duties, and that she, for her part, finds
the burden of theatrical representation quite
exhausting enough without having added to it a
task of letter-wri ting which a professed mercantile
clerk would find toilsome. Voild tout /”
At a dinner party last January Sir William
Gordon Gumming was appointed to take Lady N.
into dinner (she had heard that he had said he
hoped that when her husband died a great friend
of hers would “make an honest woman of her.”)
When he approached her, therefore, in the crowded
drawing-room she burst into hysterical tears and
cried out loudly that it was a shame to send her
into dinner with a man u'ho cheated at cards. This
created an extraordinary sensation, and was the
first public broaching of the scandal which every-
body at Tranby-Croft had agreed to keep quiet.
There is little doubt, remarks one of
the best-informed of English newspaper-cor-
respondents, that Mrs. Lycett Green before her
marriage was very fond of Sir William Gordon-
Cumming, and it was reported after the ceremony
that Sir William had boasted that he could have
married the lady, but would not. Eor this
reason neither the husband of the lady nor her
family would spare the alleged slanderer of her
good name. Gumming has always been a great
masher, and has not always held his tongue about
his alleged conquests, many of which were no
doubt imaginary.
The jamming into the peerage of Sir
George Stephen, of Canada, is regarded by know-
ing people in England as the first fruits of ex-
Governor Carington’s stupid suggestion for heating
up colonial loyalty by instituting a colonial life-
peerage. George Stephen has fallen from a self-
won position to the debasing level of a Court
toady. In 1850 he landed in Canada from Scot-
land, with nothing but strong arms and a parsi-
monious disposition. He joined a dry goods store
at Montreal, and in 12 years became head, of the
firm, from which position he swelled into an
opulent merchant, and became President of the
Bank of Montreal, and railway financier. He is
62 years old.
G. R. Sims, in the Referee, tells a good
yarn about himself and his haberdasher. For
years, says G, R. S., he has bought his ties and
gloves at a certain shop, paying cash down and
carrying away his purchases in his pocket. The
other day he found himself short of coin and asked
for his little parcel to bo sent home with the bill
enclosed. It duly arrived, addressed Sims Reeves,
Esq. Then “ Dagonet ” called at the shop and
explained that he wasn’t the septuagenarian tenor,
nor a bit like him. His next parcel arrived for
“ Reeves, Esq. ” —the shopkeeper having evi-
dently forgotten which of the two names his cus-
tomer had repudiated. “And this is fame!”
says poor Sims.
Emperor William lias just given the world
another manifestation of unfilial behaviour. - A
short time ago the rector of his parish of Kockern,
on the Rhine, was sentenced to a term of im-
prisonment for refusing to administer the sacra-
ments to a dying man until a photograph of the
Empress Frederick, the young monarch’s mother,
was removed from the bedroom. His pretext was
that the empress was in a dress that was too
decollete, and showed too much of the imperial
and somewhat voluminous bust. On the matter
being brought to the emperor’s notice, he demanded
to see the portrait of his mother which had given
offence to the priest. As soon as it was placed
before him, he gave orders for the immediate
liberation of the prisoner.
This, from the Pall Mall Gazette, is
substantially true:—
The first R.C. priest to arrive on Bendigo in ’5l was
Rev. Dr. Backhaus, a young and energetic German, with a
doctor’s degree in both divinity and medicine. He prac-
tised both professions, and naturally accumulated wealth
at a time when the smallest services were remunerattd
with nuggets. In time he became the owner of a local
brewery, a score of hotels, a station of 50,000 acres, two
vineyards, and a large amount of house property. Such
was the state of things in 1874 when the late Pope resolved
on erecting Bendigo into a bishopric, and declared that
Dr, Backhaus (then Dean) should not receive a mitre
until he severed himself from secular pursuits. That the
doctor declined to do, whereupon the Pope promptly
nominated Dr. Crane. Dr. Backhaus left his beloved
Bendigo, and retired to a mansion near Melbourne. He
died five years ago, bequeathing £250,000 to the diocese
of Bendigo, but ordering that it should be at interest for
20 years from the day of his death, apparently in oi*der to
baulk the present bishop.
There is at least one colonial precedent for
Postmaster-General O’Connor holding office with-
out being elected to Parliament by the people.
When “Dick” Ireland, Q.C., was Attorney-
General in the Victorian “ People’s ” Ministry—
Richard Heales, Premier—he failed on three dis-
tinct occasions to obtain a seat. On the third
effort, upon some informality he appealed to the
E. and Q. committee who decided that the sitting
member was not duly elected, but would not say
whether Ireland should have the seat or whether a
fresh election should take place. The matter was
referred to the House, Heales moving that the
blank in the writ be filled up with Ireland’s name.
This was fiercely opposed by J. D. Wood and
others, but finally carried and Ireland took his
seat. During that Parliament Wood always spoke
of Ireland as the “Honorable Member for the
House.”
It is wise to provide against emergencies which
are liable to arise in every family. In sudden
attacks of cold, croup, asthma, etc., a bottle of
Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral will prove a never-failing

Miss Grace Mackie, defendant in the great
M’Meckan Melbourne will-case, is a strong-
minded, shrewd, hard-headed Scotch lady. But
she is very female, for all this. Not all her strong-
mindedness, shrewdness, hard-headedness, and
Scotchness are proof against her feminine disin-
clination to own up to her real age. When
Burves, Q.C., had her on in cross-examination
frill, she stood the fire bravely, until the astute
counsellor, up to this time unable to make her
wobble, wanted to know her age. Then, all the
influence of the oath, as administered solemnly
by the associate, got weak-kneed, and Miss
Grace, aged 52, wanted to knock off five years,
right away. The effort, however, was palpable,
and the barrister saw through it. So he put on
the torture properly, and Miss Mackie had to cry
neccavi, and sue for pardon. Then Purves was
lovely. “Not from me,” solemn’y cried the
ingenuous lawyer, raising his eyes towards
Heaven, “ must you ask pardon, but from a Higher
Source.” It was bathos, and a smile, a yard wide,
settled on the countenances of those who were in
the know ; but the jury looked grave, and the
stroke went home, for you could easily see that
Miss Mackie had been brought up verr.a piously
indeed. But she had proved she was a woman.
* * *
This is verbatim : —Purves, Q.C. ; “What
was your age when you came to the colony ? ”
“ About 20.” “ I don’t want to press you unduly,
but is that a lady’s answer or a truthful one? ”
“ A lady’s answer.” “A lady’s answer; then it
is not true ! ” “No.”

The Want-Ray anecdote recalls to a Bul-
letin correspondent an incident in the life of A.
G. Taylor. While representing Mudgee in the
N.S W. Assembly that long but epigrammatic
youth passed a good deal of his bachelorhood in
Sydney, and was picked up one night by a gentle-
man who thought the Giraffe needed “ protec-
tion.” He brought him home to North Shore,
looked after him, and at the breakfast-table next
morning introduced him to the family. The lady
of tlie house inilitely hoped that Mr. Taylor
would in future take lietter care of himself, as
Ids “constituents at Mudgee might find fault
with him.” Judge of the family surprise when it
was found that the Taylor who hat! been cared for
over night was not “ Mudgee ” Taylor, at all, but
another of the satin name from a town further out
towards the baek-blocks. How is that for a
“strange coincidence ?”
One of Sydney’s best, if not the best,
domino and card-players is the walking image of
the Prince of Wales. Figure, bald-head, features,

give Tummy the “ throw-in ” of his own gambling-
kit.

The sudden “ departure ” of that “ fly ”
pair from Wynyard-square, Sydney, reminds us
of one A , a butcher, in a very large way of
business in Melbourne. He at one time failed for
a paltry hundred or so, and was looked upon—as
he pathetically said— as “ nobody.” “ Next time
I go,” he would say, “I’ll make some of their
heads ache.” When getting near the end of his
rope, he one day attended a big cattle-sale and
had a “mob” knocked down to him. “Cash,
please, Mr. A .” “ Oh, no ; the usual terms.”
“No ; cash down.” “Well, here’s my cheque.”
“ Won’t take it.” “Not take my cheque ! Why,
you’ll be refusing the cheques of these gentlemen
next,” pointing to George Petty and T. K. Ben-
nett, who stood by. “Oh, no,” quoth the
auctioneer. “I’ll take their cheques for any
amount.” “All right. Here, Petty, just swap
cheques with me.” And Petty did, for a very big
amount, and regretted it till the day of his death.
Within 48 hours A had cleared out, (leaving
Dick Goldsbrough, Petty, and s.ores of others
lamenting his defalcations, amounting to many
thousands, and, strange to say, he was never
heard of afterwards.

Edward Mirams, late postmaster in the
Victorian public service, has been sentenced to 12
months hard labour for embezzlement
“ At yesterday's sitting of the Wesleyan
Conference a discussion took place regarding the
many scandals which have lately arisen in aristo-
cratic circles, and in which the Prince of Wales,
highly-placed army officers, and members erf Par-
liament have been implicated. The Rev. Dr.
Stephenson, president of the conference, strongly
denounced the placing of bad men in high public
positions. The Conference offered up a prayer
for the conversion of the Prince of Wales and his
associates.” — (Cable.)
Did Nelson say to Hardy what it is
traditionally reported he said? The last chapter
of the discussion goes to confirm the tradition,
and to show that the man Capper, who heard from
Fletcher, whose master was told by Admiral
Smythe, who knew Hardy, “that Nelson never
spoke after he was wounded,” is simply in the last
stage of senile forgetfulness, or in the first exercise
of his faculty of fiction-writing. A Colonel
Henderson, a son of a niece of Beatty, surgeon of
the Victory, possesses the doctor’s narrative of
Nelson’s closing hours. This paper was read by
Hardy twice, and as Southey derived his account
of Nelson’s last words from it, it is safe to say
that the dying seaman’s commendation of Lady
Hamilton and his daughter to the nation, is
authentic. By-the-way, Captain Crawford Pasco,
of Queenscliff, Vic., the son of Nelson’s Flag-
Lieutenant, who hoisted the famous “duty
signal,” should have something to say on this
matter. Over his mantel at Queenscliff hangs a
letter from his father, dated from on board the
Victory at Portsmouth. It is framed in Victory
timber. Pa°co, pere, brought Governor Mac-
quarie to N.S.W. He beat to quarters just
before entering the Heads, and every gun was

sonages (of course at different hours) occupied the
self-same chair behind the “bar.” Sir Henry has
whined in the press that he would have accepted a
defeat cheerfully ; but the whining after the event
won’t dovetail in with the presence of Lady
Parkes behind the bar right through that
miserable 23-hours’sitting. The face of Sir Henry
was by no means a pleasing picture to look upon :
he looked deeply harassed under the punctures of
the barbed wire which the Labor-party has
tin-own round him ; while his spouse seemed to bo
absolutely disconsolate except when her attention
was drawn away from that coming “ breadless

Dear Bulletin, — Apropos your paragraph
about Spiridion Candiottis. In 1862 Candiottis
was one of the best-known characters on the
Lachlan goldfields. He had a dwelling-house and
dispensary in Rankin-street, Forbes, just above
the Standard Theatre. The doctor's special
hobby was anatomy, and he narrowly missed a
serious scrape while pursuing his favourite task.
A young fellow of fine physique having died of
fever, the doctor coveted his remains and tried to
fiurchase them, but without success. He there-
ore determined to resurrect the subject, and one
dark night succeeded in doing so, and boro his
prize home in triumph to his surgery. This some-
how became suspected, and the unworkmanlike
manner in which the theft at the cemetery had
been carried out lending confirmation to the
rumour that the grave had been robbed, it was
opened and the coffin found minus of its contents.
The doctor’s premises were at once raided by the
police, and he was caught red-handed in the act of
boiling the subject in a copper he had rigged up in
his kitchen, his object being to remove all the
flesh from the bones and retain the skeleton in-
tact. The matter was hushed up somehow; at any
rate it never came before the courts. There was
at this time a storekeeper on the Lachlan named
Cowen, or Scowen, but better known to the
diggers as “Old Kerosene.” This worthy was
trapped by the doctor one evening making hot
love to an actress in whom he was interested, and

Mr. C. Corbett has opened at 35 Park-
street an establishment for making shirts to order.
Of course shirts can be bought ready-made any-
where, but was there ever a ready-made shirt yet
which proyed a fit? A man with a large neck and
short arms finds himself with about a foot too
much sleeve, whilst a tall, slight man has his cuffs
round his elbows, not to mention other well-known
discomforts. Mr. Corbett guarantees the best value
in material and workmanship, at a cost of 7s. fid.
to 9s. fid. each shirt. Repairing is another
specialty at this establishment.

We strongly recommend those of our lady
readers who have not already done so to make a
trial for themselves of a new soap lately introduced
into the Sydney market. Tiiis is known as
“ Macfie’s Cold Water Soap ” for washing clothes.
We hear on all sides of its ivonderful efficiency,
and its merits as a labor-saver, to say nothing of
the economy in time and fuel, so it must prove a
perfect boon to hard-working housewives in re-
lieving them of many a weary day’s rubbing,
tubbing, and scrubbing. The principal ingredients
or this soap have long been in use at most of the
large laundries, but nothing of a similar nature
has ever been offered to the public tcfore in such
an attractive and cheap form.

Jewellery, as well as dresses and bonnets,
is subject to the freaks of fashion, in a minor
degree, perhaps, but the fact cannot be disputed
that there is such a thing as “old fashioned ”
jewellery. This used to mean one of two things—
either the old jewels had to be discarded in place
of modern ones, or old-fashioned rings, bracelets,
or brooches had to be worn. The former plan
needed well-lined pockets, but as all cannot boast
of such a happy state of affairs, it will doubtless
be interesting to know that Mr. Leon Harris, of
Market-street (next Hunter’s Boot Pala.e) re-
models old-fashioned jewellery in the most artistic
fashion. No need to wear old-fashioned jewels,
ladies.

RHEUMATISM versus MICROBE
KILLER.
294 Castleresgh-street, June 25, 1891.
Radam’s Microbe Killer 00., Gentlemen, —For
forty years I have been a sufferer from rheu-
matism, and latterly in the most aggravated form,
often having acute attacks which made me almost
helpless for days, insomuch that it was with the
greatest pain and difficulty that I could move
about at all, and only able to get up stairs on my
hands and knees. A friend who had tried the
“ Microbe Killer ” with beneficial results sent me
a jar of the medicine, which I took, and I have
now taken three jars of “Microbe Killer” and
the result has been a great wonder to myself and
my friends, for now I can get about freely, with-
out pain. Igo up and down stairs without any
trouble, and I am greatly improved in health
every way. In fact my suffering from rheumatism
seems a thing of the past, and I can recommend
the “ Microbe Killer ” to anyone with confidence,
knowing what it has done for me. Several have
tried your medicine on my recommendation for
other diseases—and one a cancer patient—with
the same beneficial results. —Yours respectfully,
MRS. WHITAKER.

fhere was an awful row in consequence. The
doctor challenged “Old Kerosene” to fight
with either swords or pistols. Ihe chal-
lenge was accepted, but the police inter-
fered to prevent the duel. The races were
on at the time, and on one of the three days
of the meeting, a fight was arranged in the ortho-
dox English fashion, with fists. The fight came
off in the scrub, about a quarter of a mile from
the grand-stand, I was there and saw it all. I
do not recollect who was the doctor’s second, but
Edmund Holloway, the actor, officiated for “ Old
Kerosene.” There were about 300 diggers present,
two or three troopers, and Captain Brown, the
o-old-commissioner. Both the combatants stripped
to the waist and went at it, hammer and tongs.
They were both very stout men, and in any-
thing but good fighting condition. The con-
sequence was that, after the first round, they
puffed and panted like a couple of porpoises.
They, however, stuck to it manfully, and
pounded one another in fine style, stimulated
by the encouraging cheers of the spectators. In
the second round the doctor succeeded in giving
Old Kerosene “a stinger on the boko,” which
tapped his claret, and caused great excitement in
the crowd. “Go it, Candy, hit him again!”
“Now then, Kerosene, walk into him,” and such
like exclamations, accompanied by a volley of the
choicest expletives, were heard on all sides. The
fight did not last long, however, for after five or
six rounds both men were so completely exhausted
that their friends persuaded them to make it a
draw and cry quits. The doctor had a black eye,
and both had a few scratches on the body, caused
by tumbling about in the scrub. They returned
to the course and shook hands over a bottle of fizz.

Some years ago a wealthy Adelaide lady
went to the late Dr. Beaney and said that her
husband, Moneybags, had for years annoyed her-
self and family with his heart-disease. He had
unavailingly consulted many leading doctors—
could Beaney do anything for him? As a result
Moneybags appeared before the diamond doctor
to explain his troubles. Nobody, he said,
understood his case. Beaney looked very wise,
told the old hunks that his heart had
shifted four inches, and, without warning, struck
him a shower of blows on the chest. “Thats
done it !” shouted the doctor. And so old Money-
bags believed until the day of his death— f rom
spinal shook through a fall downstairs.

When a fashionable funeral is on now in
Melbourne, and the mourners are gathering in the
mansion of the defunct, a strange woman gener-
ally drops in, dressed in deep black and weeping
bitterly. Nobody no ices her as a rule, or asks
her any questions. If she is observed, her pro-
found grief leads to the conviction that she is a
poor relation of the deceased, or some humble
individual to whom he had been a father and a
benefactor in thi-t vale of tears. She never says
anything, but sobs in a heart-rending manner in
a corner, and when the proceedings are over
about £3O worth of portable property is usually
missing.

while Murderer Colston clanks about in his

jingles around him as he wanders back and for-
ward, puffing his pipe.

If Parkes enforces his circular letter for-
bidding a magistrate to act as a secretary to
either a pastoralists’ or a shearers’ union, ought he
not, in common fairness, to prevent bank-managers

their interests and sympathies are interwoven
with the interests and sympathies of the pas-
toralists ?

At Gundabooka station (N.S.W.) last
week there were more police than shearers: 35
police were protecting 34 shearers. Although only
three sheds were shearing, 300 police were intro-
duced into the Bourke district. The district com-
prises 200 sheds, taking from 20 to 60 shearers
each. Now, if 300 police are essential to protect
three sheds, how many will it require for the
remaining 197. sheds ?

Did Parkes blush when Bruce Smith said
that enfranchised women would not look so much

themselves “ what sort of a husband is this man?”

Editor Bulletin. — Sir, —In justice to a young
clergyman in our district, allow me space for contradic-
tion of statements copied by you from a newspaper called
Tin: Presbyterian, which are in effect as follows :—l.
That a person dying at Moree (two months and more ago),
being an Independent in religion, the clergyman at Moree
refused to read any service at the grave. Such is one
statement. This is the fact; that the clergyman referred
to was not asked for, nor were his services desired, by the
friends of the deceased. It is true that besides myself,
there were, including the curate (incumbent) three clergy-
men of the Church of England in Moree on the Sunday on
which the funeral took place, but no one of us was asked
to take any part in the ceremony, consequently none of us
refused to do what we were not asked to do. As for the
assertion that a plea of the ground being unconsecrated
was given as a reason for not reading any service at the
grave in question, it is simply an unmitigated falsehood—
I can call it nothing else. There is no part of the ceme-
tery belonging to any body of Christians at Moree which
is consecrated, and the clergyman of the Church of Eng-
land assures me that he has several times officiated at
funerals of persons not members of the Church of England
in parts of the cemetery not assigned to our communion,
and that he is perfectly aware, and teas perfectly aware,
that no consecrated ground exists at Moree. Steps are
being taken to find out and punish the propagator of this
libel, which is malicious in both a legal and moral sense,
and which at the time was contradicted in the local press
by the incumbent and myself, as also in one or two news-
papers'in Sydney in which it had been set forth.— Jas. F.
Turner, Bp. of Grafton and Armidale.

The latest in wedding presents comes from
W.A. No, it wasn’t a £20,000 cheque. The
daughter of the riding-ganger of one of the Public
Works contracts married the possessor of a patch
of land called by courtesy a farm. To encourage
the young people and show that there was no
ill-feeling, the girl’s father presented the bride-
groom with—2o loads of stable-manure. Well, it
was more useful than the usual electro-plated fish-
slice.

Murderer-—Bigamist—Newspaper Editor
—such is the record of a lately-deceased Maori-
lander, and a few hunks from his career may be
instructive to people who feel inclined to go and
do likewise. The murder was committed in Eng-
land, in youthful blood, and owing to extenuating
circumstances (including wealthy relations), the
sentence was penal servitude for life. He behaved
well in gaol, and owing to this, and the extenuat-
ing circumstances aforesaid, he was prematurely
released, on condition that he went to “the
kawlinies.” Arrived in Maoriland, he naturally
took to running a palladium of liberty, in which
he exposed all sorts of minor scoundrels most
unsparingly. He seemed to have homicidal mania,
and on several occasions came near murdering his
wife. Once he set forth, with a loaded revolver,
intent on the gore of a rival editor, but was met
and judiciously filled drunk on the way, so that
his benevolent object was frustrated. It was only
after the death of this notable that the fact of his
bigamy came to light. On his relatives at Horae
being appealed to for aid to the widow and
orphans in the Land of the Moa and the Maori,
they replied, in effect: “What do you mean?
We have been supporting his wife and family
here ever since he first went to prison !”

A LAST REQUEST.
(INSCRIBED TO DR. CREED, M.L.C.)
O ! let me lie, when I am dead,
Where ne’er a wattle green
Can wave its branches overhead,
Nor any grass be seen.
0 ! put me not where children play }
I know how they behave,
And want no boys to sneak away
The flowers from my grave.
’Tis not in quiet, verdant nook
I'd pitch my final camp,
And listen to a babbling brook
Which kept my coffin damp.
Let poets prate of stars above—
I could not slumber sound
If spoony pairs came making love
Upon my little mound.
A marble slab I don’t require,
Nor palings that will rust;
But bake my body in the fire,
Till nought is left but dust;
An urn’s the nicest “lonely bed”
(I’ve one cremated niece) —
O ! let me lie when I am dead
Upon the mantelpiece.

CORRESPONDENCE
J. H. Rainey ” : Thanks ; we await the result
of the enquiry into the wreck “E.P.D.”: The one
point you make concerns the omission of a comma. The
Bulletin rarely “shakes its own hand” “ Mindai
Under consideration..E.B. ” (Goulburn): Have not
yet received your sketches... Will read
“John”; Yes, at usual rates and pnder usual conditions
... “A. J. M'Kelvey”: (1) 1688. (2) It is a branch of
the Mitchell and is dry half the time. (3) Farkes, when
he can, will probably resign and leave the Labour-party
to tight the rest of the N.S. VV. Assembly. Then, when a
big clear-cut issue comes up or can be manufactured, he
will return to politics in the role of the greatest democrat
of them a 11.... “ IV. Martin ” : Literally, “ one pillow, one
thought.” “Segenhoe”: Don'tgo to Jaw. Under the
circumstances stated, you are morally bound tos upport
her, though she has no legal redress against you. Were
the facts declared in print, you would appear to the world
as the meanest man unhanged. If you don’t believe this,
just go to the local police-magistrate (or, if you like,
to the local Anglican Dean, or the R.C. Bishop, or the
Presbyterian minister) and ask for arbitration
“Gebe”: If any Labour member takes a seat on the
N.S. VV. Parliamentary Works Committee, let the extia
pay go to the Labour Electoral League funds. Other-
wise, the acceptance of place and pay may draw his
pilitical teeth.... “ W.E.M.”: Not suitable.... “ W.F.F.” :
Bosh is the name for it. ..“ E. M‘H.” (Rochester): You
certainly are not trammelled by the exigencies of rhyme,
and if, as you assert, the “ workers don’t care a brass
farthing for rhythm,” why trouble to write verse? ~
“C.N.”; Carington always was in trade; his stock-in-
trade was blarney.... “ S.Y.L.” : Scarcely' up to standard.
“Child of Nature”: All your arguments against
“woman suffrage” have been adduced and disproved
against “manhood suffrage.” There’s nothing in them.
....“Robert Bostock, Esq.”: Address wanted. Letter
awaiting you at Bulletin office “Observer”: Thanks.
Will consider for next week. ..“Wallaby”: Thanks;
will say something about it “T.R.”: To hand ;
“ Walter L’Estrange”: A powerful thing “D.VV.R.”’
(Coburg): Thanks.... “C.J.S.” : Will consider.“ A.
Mackenzie” : The landlords who let the Chinese gambling
shops—they are the chief culprits “Clod£>,Let him
“ gang his ain gait.” “A. Lenton ” : Thei£ is nothing
in the N.S.W. Labour platform about Parkel or Dibbs, or
about Freetrade or Protection “BosWe have
heard the story in several quarters. A on the
subject should be proposed in the Assembly.. ..“ Kitty
F.” (Melb.); Afraid you are a hard cased “Where, Oh
Where are They ? ” was by Francis Myers, between whose
style and that of the other man there is as much differ-
ence as there can be between the styles of any two
men. Myers doesn t set up to be a humorist; if he has a
fault it is that he is too deadly in earnest. The otherman
was never and never could be serious. .. “K. W.” (Melb.):
The enquiry as to his transactions with the Co.
is now proceeding “Wyralla”: Verses want
pith; too gushy “H.R.”: It isn’t poetry, and
we don’t think there’s much “in it.” “M. and J
Callaghani”; Verse very unequal and too long; a hun-
dred lines on fleas ! Hardly .. .“Asilicus”: Good copy,
but not suitable... “Pivot”: Not enough snap
“ Horrible Rain”: A weak parody is simply an aggrava-
tion of the original’s sins... “Wallaby”: Selfishness, the
parent of profit and competition, is not the great incen-
tive to human exertion. Every good, noble, artistic,
and generous impulse that the world has known,
or will know, is prompted by a desire to increase
self-respect, to win the approbation of mankind
“ Hodge”: Do you think we could print many lines of
this character ?
Your clobber is of a loud design :
Your manners are worse than an adult male swine.
“ Looking Forward ”: You evidintly lack discrimina-
tion, and don’t appear to understand the article you
attack. Henry George declares, like the writer you
slangwhang, that “ the food sunp’y is limited ;” both
assert that this is owing to the fact that the opportunities
for producing food are limited by monopoly, not that the
sources of production are inadequate. “To each accord-
ing to his or her wants,” and “Needs not deeds,” are
well-known Communistic axioms “A. H. Coates”:
“Jock Gillespie ” was labelled a “Scotch selection, ” ergo,
we did not print it as original “C.J.”: The Labour-
party should never rest until Labour is as well and
expertly represented on the Marine Board as Capital
“ A.M.”: The Bulletin always listens with the ear of
scorn to narratives of heroism told by the heroes and
heroines themselves “ E.L.” (Maitland): Very much
obliged, indeed “Nationalist” : To hand. Thanks
“ G.E.0.” (Melb.): Thanks . . “Ah Hee ” : “ The Fox and
the Crow” was undoubtedly of .Esopian origin,
but La Fontaine was not above adaptation. You can buy

“ Bathurst” ; The Bulletin is an absolutely independent
paper, which owes allegiance to no individual, party, or
sect. It is no more responsible for the Parliamentary
utterances, actions, or opinions of any politician who may
be or who may have been connected with it than it is for
the utterances of General Booth or Pope Leo. No poli-
tician has any proprietary interest in The Bulletin, nor
does any politician or political party exercise over it con-
trol of any kind ; nor have its directors any personal
political ambition or desire to enter Parliament or to
grind the axe of any individual with any such ambition.
The strength of The Bulletin, as its conductors are
aware, lies in its complete independence, which has been
proved and will be carefully preserved.
Lawyer: “What do you know of the
accused?” Witness: “I know him to be a
drunkard, but, apart from that, as honest a man as
any in Mudgee.’’ Judge Docker: “Be careful
you are not libelling Mudgee.”
A new diving device now being introduced
among the Northern pearlers is “ a sort of shield
or armour of copper, which fits inside the dress
and over the hips of the diver, and keeps the dress
from pressing upon the vital portions of the human

are also being brought into vougue.
Redgrave, in his diary, relates how
Rogers, the poet, a most absent-minded man, told
an equally absented-minded friend of how, walking
in the Champs “I was met by an old
lady who stopped and, looking fixedly at me,
said, ‘Sir, isn’t your name Rogers?’ Pausing a
moment, he was interrupted by his friend, who
said, “ Well, and was it?’”

Earl Hopetoun invited all members of
Victorian Parliament whose surname initials

mahogany last week, and the people who were,

Poor old “Poddy” Boyle, of Orange,
N.S.W., has bottomed his last claim, and the
news of his death will move stirring memories in
the minds of thousands of old Australian diggers.
This Donegal bhoy came to Australia in ’59 and
was one of the first on the Snowy River diggings
in ’GI. Next he tackled the Lachlan, N.S.W.,
and made a rise ; wandered on to the Macquarie;
anon, into Queensland to the Canal Creek dig-
gings ; then, made a pile on a trip through the
Isles of New Zealand, and across the Pacific to
Californy, oh ! Back again in N.S.W., he was in
the Gulgong rush, which he left when the Parkes
rush broke out. In 75, he settled in Orange and
took to pub-keeping, drawing his last cork and
breath in the Diggers’ Arms.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Who pays for cabling that Mr. Dan. Cooper has
mn third for a minor two-year-old race at Goodwood?
The horse (it wasn’t Dan. himself who ran third) is
Er.«dish-bred, and can run first, last, or anywhere it
chooses without altering the fact that we don’t care a
straw The Austraiianly-untaxed Mr. Dan. Cooper's
doings on the British turf are becoming an infernal nuis-
ance°to the far-off country which produces his unearned
increment -which produces the good red gold he is
chucking away in a foreign country.

One of the Victorian Mounted Rifles expedition
has written over to say that Carbine could give two stone
to any English thoroughbred, and that the only real first-
class animal he (the warrior) saw at “home” was Mons.
Meg the Australian filly. Was it Anthony Trollope who
remarked a disposition to “ blow ?” By the way, Carbine
happens to be a full-blooded Britisher, foaled in Maori-
lancl‘ « # #
A Melbourne paper, calling itself The Sports-
man ignored Roberts’ entertainment at the Athenaeum,
for the simple reason, apparently, that the billiard-
champion had staked some money at the office of a rival
r.v. Meanwhile, this miserable mockery of what a
sporting paper might be was deluging the larrikins with
streams' of pugilistic drivel- fountains of ungrammatical
gush—concerning all the broken-nosed Bobs and Billys
who can induce a “club ” of infatuated jugginses to pay
for the privilege of seeing strong animals put to the worst
possible use under Heaven. Journalism can’t sink much
lower than The Sportsman’s three-column description of
“ How We Found Sullivan,” in the course of which ap-
pears this immortal observation of the Slugger’s, printed
n huge type: “ Walk Right Up Herb and Take a Drink.”
° * * •
The last week ortwohas been a gory timeforthose
sections of the Melbourne and Sydney publics which
delight in “game chickens,” and swallow the drivel of
sporting papers concerning what might have happened if
Jim had got fairly home with his “ terrible right” in the
first round, or Champion This hadn’t “clinched ’ instead
of trying to plug Champion That on the “old spot.”
Considering that Goddard knocked out Choynski in a
genuine fashion, the encounter between those two well-
grown gentlemen was more conducive to sporting in-
sanity than the “ battle of the light-weights” in Sydney,
decided by one light-weight stoushing the other light-
webdit when he was kneeling, and therefore getting him-
selMgnominiously defeated on a “foul.” But neither
"■reat'event was worth a-tenth part of the money sub-
scribed to the inevitable “purse,” or anted-up to the
equally inevitable “gate.” The cash expended upon
professional pugilism is sadly wasted, even though it may,
in some eases, be the means of putting the roof of a pub.
over the bullet-heads of heroes the bulk of whom would,
if left to earn a decent living, be tolerably certain to
settle down in a prison. The so-called courage and
endurance of the broken-nosed brotherhood must be
sporting fictions, for tbe simple reason that 49 out of
every 50 of them degenerate into loafers when their little
day is ended. Where’s the courage of the bloated, played-
out plugger who asks you to give him a dollar for old
acquaintance sake ? Is he “ game ”to look out for a job ?
As for the “ cleverness ” of these people—most sickening
of the sporting “gags” in sporting rags—well, look at
the heads and faces of the odd 49 out of 50, draw them
into conversation, consider them in all their bearings,
and then say whether it’s possible for such over-rated
animals to be clever at anything (fighting not excepted)
under the sun.
# * *
John L. Sullivan said in America that he was
“making barrels of money” out of the stage. One
moderate-sized barrel will, we are afraid, be enough to
hold all the money John will make out of the Australian
stage, if he is paid strictly according to results. John
may be a god in his own country, but in this beastly place
every larrikin firmly believes that there are three Aus-
tralians, at least, who are thirsting to knock the stuffing
out of Johnel, and that two of them would probably
succeed ; also, that he could find a policeman good enough
to take Johnel in tow if necessary. The only possible
chance of redemption which The Bulletin sees for “ the
Big Fellow,” is for him to induce Sara Bernhardt to piay
Cleopatra to his Antony. Failing this, he should have a
shy at Joe Goddard.
» * *
The advent of J. L. Sullivan reminds us of
Morrisey and Bob M'Laren. Old Ballarat diggers will
remember Bob when he kept the Glasgow Arms in the
Main Road. Bob. fought and beat the great Morrisey
in California when, as he used to say, he held his life in
his fist, as the ring was surrounded by men armed with
revolvers and nearly all in favour of the American. Bob
imported his brother Alfred—who was also a “ bit of a
dab ” with his fists and not half a bad singer under his
concert-hall name of “Arthur Romer.” Poor Bob died
of a broken-heart—a woman at the bottom of his troubles.
“ Arthur Romer ” hung himself in the cabin of the
Cheviot on the voyage to Sydney. Look back on your
life, dear friend. It is one long funeral.
* * *
A fight not on the programme lately came off
at a certain fashionable club. It was in the small hours
of a.m., after an exciting night, when a well-known
amateur boxer, to freshen things up, began Witting a new
arrival from the old country, and a perfect Johnnie in
appearance. Words ran high, and the end was four
rounds with the small gloves for a breakfast all round.
A well-known leader of the bar held the watch, a
“Professor” was the referee, and the seconds were—well,
nevermind. The affair lasted only two rounds, and the
Johnnie showed thecompany thathe, forone, was “no Jim
Smith.” In the words of a certain fat gentleman; “By
, it was a take down.”
* # #
Melbourne has just sprouted a few typical
welching cases. Police Magistrate Panton said, with an
evident knowledge of the gambling world, that the
welchers’ victims were as despicable and blameworthy as
the welchers. The fact is that each party to any such a
transaction is trying, if not to diddle the other, to make
unearned money. One victim met his victimiser “ after
many days ” in a public thoroughfare, and, very natu-
rally, there were “larx.” Both were hauled up on
charges of “ insulting behaviour.” Bookie was fined 40s.
and victim 10s. Why the difference, seeing that the
gambling transaction itself was not before the Court, is
only known to minds severely magisterial. Bookie
declared he couldn’t pay the fine. “Then,” said Panton,
“you will go up for 14 days, and it will do you good. ’
We don’t quarrel with the incidence of justice, but it is
not law.
# # #
An artless, but otherwise respectable, citizen
came to sore distress at the North v South Melbourne
football match. In a moment of reckless enthusiasm he
shrieked “ Bully for North !” whereupon the gentleman
standing next to him, a stranger and a free-born ex-
pectorator of blasphemy and tobacco-juice, folded up a
large, bony fist and sent the amateur barracker stealing
silently away with a black eye. That was bully for
Sowth, that was. ,
* # #
Speaking of the “ national game ” of Victoria,
a meeting of Ballarat Wesleyans has passed a resolution
calling upon the leadiug clubs to strike at the “ root of
those evils”—viz., betting and bad language—which are
“ felt to be making it difficult for members of Christian
churches to patronise football matches.” Which strikes
tub Bulletin as being a terribly large Order for the lead-
ing clubs. Besides, why doesn’t the Christian Churqh
itself go and dig in the vineyard for that root, instead of
threatening to stand afar off and barrack for its own
immortal soul ? The duty of reforming football rests with
the Y.M.C.A. who must gather the various secretaries,
goal-sneaks,” captains, managers, and “half backs”
into the fold, and induce them to hurl all bookmakers
(who are puffy and easily hurled) into the outer darkness,
and stick up largo exhortations, painted in white against
a black ground, to swear not at all. Then the “Fitzroy
Forties,” “Collingwood Pusli,” and “ Sons of the Sowth
will flee from the wrath to come, remarking in a pious
pianissimo that “football is dry ’ash,” and the game will
be national no more, Nothing is national unless there s
plenty of cursing in it. Look at the N.S.W. Legisla-
ture, for instance.

Some Melbourne billiard-censors think Roberts’
play not quite O.K. on one point. They say he pushes

V.R.Q. gives Handicapper Barnard £5OO a year

Surly, stiff-built old Barnes, the Nottingham
cricketer, is in great form again. Playing against York-
shire he scored an innings of 104, and took four wickets
for 16 runs—a performance which ought to land him in
Lord Sheffield’s team.

A certain Melbourne “bookie” advertises his
calling by securing, as often as he can, the Governor’s box
in a theatre on big-draw nights, and sits there enthroned
in a blaze of jewellery that would almost crush the Shah

• * *
A typical little history. Rive years ago the
scavengers went out on strike for eight hours per day, and
one of the rank-and-file, who promised well as a nigger-
driver, got a gangership. It had for years been his am-
bition to make a small book, and now came his chance.
It was easy to induce his men to stake a few shillings in his
book. Next we find the ex-scavenger on the Hill, still
doing well. Next year again, in tall hat and broadcloth,
he cries the odds in the Paddock, and at this present
moment he is the proud possessor of some of the very
finest of Australia’s horses and dogs. In the usual course
of things this ex-knight of the broom will be “ doing ”
Europe and giving his opinion on Australian racing.

Harry Stockdale’s Northern Territory buffalo-
shooting party duly left by the Menmuir for Port Essing-
ton. From all we hear, the buffaloes on the mainland
have been pretty' well thinned out of late years, but you
can have some beautiful buffalo—and nigger—shooting on
Melville Island, hard by. The Melville Island niggers
can, in fact, be backed for ferocity against the Brooker
Island people, who ate up Ingham and Co.

We add to our list of wealthy N.S.W. ex-stage-

An American account of the Slavin-Kilrain
fight is calculated to inspire a calm Christian peruser to
rush home and strangle his aged parents. “Up they
come for the third round, “Go at him, Jake ! Jump right
into him 1” shouts Cleary, as the men go to the centre of
the ring. Kilrain jumps in with his big arms swinging
like those of a grizzly bear (who ever saw a bear’s arms
swing?). He goes at Slavin full tilt, and there is a dull
rattle of blows which sound like the thudding of flails. It
is awful. Men stand upon their seats, swaying to and fro
with each terrible blow, grunting and groaning, with all
the bloodthirsty instincts of their barbarous forefathers
glowing in unmistakeable characters upon their faces.”
| What sympathy between actors and audience! The
1 patrons of the noble sport grunting and swaying in
unison with the gents who wereflghting for their “purse !”
And then the instincts glowing in characters, like Bel-
shazzar’s writing on the wall—O! it must have been
delicious.
FROM SYDNEY TO MELBOURNE ON
BICYCLES.
INCIDENTS BY THE WAY.
Mr. J. Pearson, of King-street Arcade, the well-
known cycling tourist, when riding over to Mel
bourne with Ins friend, Mr. A. Gr. Chapman,
relates several adventures they met with on their
long journey :
Por four days after leaving Sydney terrible wet
weather was experienced, and many of the water-
courses, which in the summer time are nearly dry,
were swollen so much that they had great diffi-
culty in crossing them.
On one occasion they were compelled to strip
and carry their machines across, the current being
sostrong that they were inimminentdangerof being
swept away. Although they were for several days
riding in wet clothes no dire results accrued, as on
each evening after retiring they took the pre-
caution to rub themselves down with St. Jacobs
Oil, which Mr. Peai'son always carries with him
on his tours, finding it a capital remedy for stiff-
ness and soreness of the muscles, as well as a
preventative and cure for painful ailments
induced by cold.
After getting over the dividing range the
weather changed from wet and cold to excessive
heat. On one day especially the thermometer was
98 in the shade.
Numerous snakes were met with on the journey,
passing several coiled up in the middle of the
road. One monster, over six feet long, caused
them some trouble, as in trying to avoid it the
two cyclists collided, the result of which was a
bruised wrist and a swollen ankle, but the appli-
cation of the ever ready St. Jacobs oil prevented
any bad effects. They reached Melbourne safely,
averaging 64 miles per day, and received a great
reception from their brother wheelmen of the
southern capital.
THE PRINCE OF WALES.
H.R.H. is recognised as being in a bad way by
the Wesleyan Conference sitting in London, or
they would scarcely have considered it necessary
to offer up prayers for his conversion. It is really
not easy to feel anything but sorrow for this genial
but misguided gentleman, who is denounced as a
common spieler, made the subject of ribald ballads
in the democratic press and of cartoons in the
illustrateds. And then, after he has undergone
all these things, and paid the penalty of publicity
in its worst shapes, he is prayed for like a new
recruit at a Salvationist meeting. It scarcely
seems worth while to be a prince now, so great
are the restrictions placed on the occupant of the
billet, although the screw is still good and the
perquisites large and frequent ; but the halcyon
days are gone by for princes and most other
potentates, and in the course of a few fleeting
years they will all be compelled to learn the
unpleasant but inevitable lesson that they can
only be tolerated on condition of being very quiet
and well-behaved, expre sing no opinions and
attracting no attention beyond what is absolutely
necessary when they pay their periodical visits to
the Treasury to draw pension allowances, which
will terminate for ever and ever at their deaths.
Long before that time, however, it will have
become universally recognised that no matter how
many princes there may be, and without any
regard to their morals or peculiarities, there is but
one source of artificial light that can justly and
honestly claim superiority over all others known,
and that is the latest discovery, Luxene, the new
illuminant, about which it is impossible to say
aught but what is good and for the more exact
definition of which there are no expressions in the
English language that can possibly flatter it, or
do it more than common justice. For safety,
economy, brilliancy, and general comfort it has no
compeer and never will have during the lifetime
of this generation. Luxene is a staple of supply
with Messrs. John Barlow and Co. ; T. W. Eady
and Son ; Mason Bros., Limited ; D. Mitchell
and Co. ; Tilloek and Co. : J. Keep and Sons;
Holdsworth, MTherson, and Co.; M‘Lean Bros,
and Rigg, Limited ; of Fred. Butcher, and Robt.

ONE MAN ONE VOTE.
ONE DAY ONE ELECTION.
ONE PEOPLE ONE DESTINY.
That is what the present eruption in the political
world means, if it means anything; and if the
people’s representatives who have headed the polls
in those electorates which have been hitherto kept
sacred to the brazen-faced god of property can
keep their heads, and go slow, and maintain their
integrity in spite of all the machinery that will be
set in motion to circumvent them, and resist to
the death every attempt made to convert them
intoCs.M.G. and lords and “docks” and other
similarly idle and frequently vagrant personages.
In which case the Destiny is a foregone conclusion
for which it is not at present necessary to find a
name, and the People will be the most prosperous
and Australia the nearest approach to a model
country this side of the millennium. To help on
this most desirable prospect it will be necessary
to have also
ONE TIME AND ONE TIMEPIECE,
the latter being of necessity the Waterbary
Watch, which is the only timekeeper that can bo

should do, and never to go back on its principles

POLITICAL POINTS
Labour-politics are not party-politics.
N.S, Wales needs more national politics,
and less metropolitics.
Toby Barton “ does not admit that politics
is a profession.” It’s all profession.
Electors of Australia, fight'for the key of
the front-door of your inheritance : One Man One
Vote.
Teetotaller Munro, on the beer-tax, shows
that he can swallow principles even if he can’t
swallow beer.
Until One-Man-One-Vote becomes a fact,
the people will only “stand about the portals
of Government.”
“Governments have always discouraged
independent and original talent, and have always
promoted mediocrity. ” —Gorst,
Barton used 280 I’s to Jack Want’s 200 in
his N.S.W. Assembly speech on the Imperialisa-
tion of Australia Inoculation Bill.
Latest from Maoriland :—That in future
the Upper Chamber be made elective and that
a 1 members be elected exclusively by the female
fraichise.
Powers, M.P., moves in Queensland
Assembly for one-man-one-vote, all elections on
cne day, and the closing ol public-houses on
election-day.
Munro’s talk of economy in the Vic-
torian Civil Service has resulted in a proposed
saving of £5680 for the coming year. What is
that among so many ?
Dr. Cockburn (S.A.), who moves for the
abolition of party-Government, has submitted,
amid “cheers and laughter,” a resolution for the
election of Ministers by the House.
Premier Munro: “I believe in getting
money when we can.” How Scotch ! Now for
the honest dishonest politician who will say, “I
believe in getting money how we can.”
The latest is that ex-Treasurer Garvan
have been dining with Premier Parkes. Here
you may perhaps see why the old man is keeping
the door of the N.S.W. Treasury open.
A “formal motion for adjournment ” in
the Queensland Parliament, the other day, lasted
the whole of the sitting. It was an attack on
railway mismanagement by E. J. Stevens, and the
motion was only withdrawn 5 minutes before
midnight. This is almost unique in parliamentary
procedure.
During 1890-1, N.S.W. exported one-third
of the total Australian and N.Z. yield of wool.
Her wool-sales were 251,314 bales. Her total im-
ports, £22,615,004; exports, £22,045,973.
Jawbone Neild is the hero of the shortest
as well as of the longest speech in the N.S.W
Assembly. His speech on the recent no-confidence
motion is represented by six lines of Hansard.
Parkes one day denies that he knows any-
thing of Mr. Cotton. Yet next day, almost, he
says Mr. Cotton “would grace any deliberative
assembly in the world or sometlfng like that.
Mystery.
Premier Munro thinks that by auctioning
some public lands and issuing £750,000 Treasury
bonds Victoria can, with economy and care, get
through the year very nicely without additional
taxation.
The cause of Independent Australia lias
many advocates in the N.S.W Parliament.
Miller, from Monaro, spoke warmly in its favour
the other night, to a sympathetic, if sleepy-looking,
Assembly.
What price now for Canadian public and
political morality as a pleasant foil to the
“Republican corruption” of the United States,
so continuously referred to in the English and
Australian daily press ?
Australia leads, England follows. .“One-
man-one-vote ” will be a feature of the next
English general election. The doughty old
champion, Sir George Grey, will, in all proba-
bility, be there to support it.
“ I simply give my word against that of
the hon. gentleman (Nick Willis), knowing that
those who know me will take my word, and that
those who do not know the hon. gentleman may
believe him.” —Frank Cotton.
Minister of Railways Unmack declares
that the Queensland Railway Commissioners have
already saved their salaries several times over.
Shiels says the Victorian Commissioners have cost
the Southern colony several millions extra.
George Reid appears to be genuinely
delighted at the entrance of the N.S.W. Labour-
party into Parliament, which is, he says, speaking
as one who wishes to see work done, tlie healthiest
and most hopeful sign he has seen for years.
“Tom” Rose, M.L.A., say’s the N.S.W.
Labour-party are “only Freetraders in disguis o ,”
Had they voted to put Rose’s party into office
John Haynes would have styled them “veiled
Protectionists.” You can’t please everybody.
“Hi never copy Victoria.” Yet, in the
very next breath, Parkes announced his intention
of introducing a measure for the self-registration of
electors —a plan which a quarter of a century a; °
emanated from the brain of R. D. Ireland, Q.O.
In N.S. W, Assembly. Shearer Williams
speaks:-“I believe in Federation” (Parkes :
“ ’Ear, ’ear ”), “ but I am totally opposed to the
proposed Constitution ” (the House; “ Hear,
hear”), and, what is more, 1 will oppose it.”
(Parkes exit.)
Every Australian Bishop consecrated in
England, literally holds his See and all its spirit-
ualities and temporalities on condition of being
faithful to Queen Victoria and her heirs. Which
is another strong argument for consecrating the
Australian chief-shepherds here.
“ Hon. members have declared that a
knowledge of English literature and English law
is not sufficient to enable a man to enter the legal
profession. Why, these two subjects comprise all
the knowledge on the face of the earth, literary
and legal,”— Sir George Grey.
Toby Barton (18 months ago) at Gran-
ville : —“Protection will come years before Federa-
tion ;of that I am sure. One misconception which
has arisen is that I am going to sink the fiscal
controversy until Federation is attained. No
more nonsensical misconception ever existed in
the world.”
On Crispi’s motion the Italian Parliament
has unanimously voted a Mazzini monument.
The King subscribes largely, but this reminds you
of Louis Philippe’s fatal mistake in fetching Napo-
leon’s remains from St. Helena, whence Thiers’
revival of the Napoleonic Legend in his great
history.
The N.S.W. Labour-elected members who
want to summarily throw out Parkes, instead of
making him their obedient servant against his
own will, need a liberal education in the art of
revenge. Their present ideas on the subject are
those current in Tipperary and on the Svdney
“Rocks.”
Tom Glassey, the Queensland member who
could only get three supporters in Parliament the
other day, will yet lead as big and as compact a
following as did Parnell in the strongest time of
the Home Rule party. The mere fact that he
made Chief Secretary Tozer furiously savage
shows that his tactics are telling.
There appears good ground for believing
that the Parkes Government actually felt one or
two msmbei-s of the N.S.W. Labour-party on the
POLICE STATION AT THE NEW GOLDFIELDS, “ PARADISE,” QUEENSLAND.
suoject of portfolios, and that the latter cautiously
felt their constituents on the subject. The
response of the electors not being encouraging,
nothing was said upon the subject.
To the Individualist liberty means a man’s
freedom to do as he likes, trammelled only by the
possession of similar rights by others. To the
Socialist liberty means a man’s freedom to do as
he ought; a making his duty to society the chief
corollary of the opportunity for action arising
from the recognition of his right to freedom.
The fact that Victoria’s customs’ revenue
for 1890-1 was less than anticipated, only proves
that Victoria now grows or makes the
articles she was formerly compelled to import.
Analysis of the returns bears this out. Foreign-
grown or manufactured articles show decreases;
but exotics such as tea, coffee and chocolate show
increases.
Writes David Taller man :
Ireland suffers because it has excluded the Jewish
element from its people ; for the commercial intelligence
of our race would not have allowed the natural advantages
that Ireland possesses to lie dormant. No people could
compete with Ireland in the supply to the English markets
if matters were properly managed.
“Why is Ireland poor and discontented ?” Be-
cause she has no Jews !
Parkes’ first Government business on the
official paper, be it noted, was not One-man-one-
vote, but a motion affirming the beauty of woman-
suffrage. He deliberately gave precedence to this
fad, and thus brought the business paper into con-
flict with the Governor’s speech. He jibs on fully
enfranchising the men, and shows symptoms of
being under petticoat government.
M‘Millan’s administration of the N.S.W.
Treasury and Railways, summed up by Schey,
parliamentary mouthpiece of the railway and
tramway employes:—“Mr. M'Millan, the ac-
countant, uses figures to prove facts ; Mr. M‘M.,
the politician, uses words to distort facts. For
Mr. M'M., the accountant, I have a profound
respect; for Mr. M'M., the politician, I have
nothing but the most profound contempt.”
The Bulletin notices the formation in
one of the Sydney suburbs of a “ Freetrade Labour
E'ect oral League.” The Labour elector who joins
and at the poll adheres to either a Freetrade or
Protectionist organisation is simply sawing at
Labour’s carotid artery. Labour’s only chance
is solidarity consequent on the litter sinking of
the fiscal question. The Freetrade Labour Elec-
toral League promoters are wool-clad wolves.
Sydney Echo declares against One-Man-
One-Vote, which, it says, “is against the best
sense of the country.” What Sydney Echo says,
the S.M. Herald thinks, but suppresses ; the
other alternative is that the S.M. Herald pro-
prietary are guilty of the immorality of vending
for money two classes of political opinions. There
is a desperate fight ahead, dear friends, over One-
Man-One-Vote, which is the foundation of ail
things.
The Bulletin doesn’t care a rap what
“ decision ” was given 40 years ago in re the
precedence of ecclesiastical dignitaries in Aus-
tralia. All “decisions” on the subject, not
founded on the bedrock fact that there is no
State Church in Australia, and that in the eye
of the Australian law the Particular Baptists are
just as big as the whole Roman Church, with the
Pope thrown in, are mere flam and waste-paper.
All are equal, because in the eye of the State none
are anything.
President Storey, of Sydney Chamber of
Commerce, speaking of the great strike said :
“Now that the labour-struggle is over who can
say that good will no'; result?” Now that ivhat
is over? “The trial of strength?” Bah! It is
one continuous, never ending, never slacken-
ing trial. It is the bioplasm of the centuries;
the warfare of the oppressed against the
oppressors; the inevitable corollary of human
wrongs, and it must endure so long as evil lives
upon the earth. Over ?
Say what men may, the argument ad-
vanced that the sexes are mentally equal is
nonsense. The strong woman in the circus may
be stronger than any man present, but the average
of the men who look on at her are far stronger
than the average of the women. And as it is
physically, so, in all human probability, it is men-
tally, not only as regards developed actualities,
but also in respect to latent possibilities. That
is not the ground on which woman may fairly seek
the suffrage.
The storm in the A.N.A. teapot about a
certain Major Hoad has ended in Alfred Deakin
and the “ natives ” generally being satisfied that
the Major’s retirement from active service in the
Association was necessary to the proper fulfilment
of his military duties. Thank goodness that’s all
right. Why the A.N.A. should ever have had
such an insane desire to hang on to a Majah is a
problem that no republican new-chum can solve.
In fact, the purpose and policy of the A.N.A.
becomes more hopelessly muddled and mixed
every week.
The N.S.W. Labour-party voted against
Parkes’ abstract motion concerning woman
suffrage, simply because they did not wish the
Electoral Reform Bill delayed or thrown out.
For similar reasons they voted against Fitzgerald’s
ill-advised amendment, after it had been accepted
as a vote of censure by the Premier. The U pper
House want an excuse to delay One-man-one-vote,
a measure for which the province has unanimously
declared; Parkes, with his womanhood suffrage
(on which the country has not spoken), was about
to furnish them with one.
Parkes’ Electoral Bill should be amended
so as to ’prevent any Premier or Government in
the future from using the machinery of Govern-
ment to defeat Opposition candidates in the
various constituencies. The Bulletin rises to
suggest that it should be made an offence, punish-
able by a heavy fine, for a Minister of the Crown
to hire a special tram, to offer a bridge, a road, a
railway, or a courthouse in return for minis-
terial support, to “J.P.” or offer to “J.P.”
political wire-pullers, to promise to “M.L.C.” a
wavering candidate if he happens to be defeated,
or in any other way to interfere with the free
action of a constituency.
The exclusion at will of strangers from
Parliament is an antiquated relic of tyrannical
times. The people—so long as they behave them-
selves (and the House has plenary powers of
punishment for misbehaviour within its pre-
cincts) —should be free to attend all sessions of
the People’s House. Secret sittings are inherently
bad in a deliberative Assembly supposed to bo
responsible to the electors. To say that men can
send otheis into a paid Parliament, and must not
be permitted to watch how the latter act when
they get there, is to state a lopsided proposition
equivalent to arguing that an employer should be
debarred from observing his employees at work.
The present corrupt J.P. system won’t be
remedied by the appointment of proletarian
magistrates. The honorary J.P. is no good any-
how. He knows no law, but thinks he knows
everything. Amateur J.P.’s should everywhere,
and at whatever'cost, be superseded by professional
magistrates, and the latter, instead of being
allowed to settle down in one place and grow grey-
headed among vested interests, should be shifted
every three years and absolutely prohibited from
belonging to any secret society. During the last
20 years, wherever we have been in Australia, we
have found Sullivan, J.P., hearing the case of
his cousin Ryan, J.P., and Jones rounding up
friendly beaks to take the starch out of his
ancient enemy, Jones.
Dear Bulletin, —J. J, C. Abbott, Q.C.,
leader of the Montreal bar, highly paid solicitor
for the Canadian Pacific Railway, recently chosen
by the Tory party of Canada to carry out the
Imperialistic policy of Sir John Macdonald, held
different political views in his younger days.
Way back in the fifties he was one of the signers
of the Annexation Manifesto, a sort of political
round-robin in which the signers, after naming
various reasons for the faith that was in them,
pledged themselves to agitate for the union of the
Canadian provinces with the United States.
Copies of this interesting document are still
extant, though most of the signers are in their
graves, and a majority of the remainder dislike
any reference to the pamphlet. By the way, what
became of Abbott’s much-advertised visit to Aus-
tralia “to promote commercial intercourse with
Canada ?” He got as far as London on his way to
the Antipodes, some 12 months ago. and then
apparently turned tail. Did the Agcnts-General
throw cold water on his mission ? Kanuck.
“It was in-
deed a very de
cided majority,
and imposed upor
him and his col-
leagues the obliga-
tion of doing the
best they could
to govern the
country by the
suppiort of that
majority.”

prcaching mar-
riage of the
Marquis of Hart-
iugton and the
Dowager Duchess

widow of our dear
old guinea-pig
friend, is now
denied “on the
best authority.”
If this is so the
Marquis and the
Duchess have very ‘
nearly allowed the

the sort of joke
which would be
likely to suit the
man who calmly
yawned in the middle of his own first speech in

The institution of monarchism must of its
own weakness die. Monarchism is an unhealthy
loaferdom, and anything that has laziness is con-
sequently weak, mentally and physically. Unless
the Guelphs and the Hohenzollerns and all the
other cancerous and gouty kings and queens of
the Royal houses of Europe whose blood has been
filtered through centuries of vice and laziness and
languor decide to be treated at the polypotent
Bethel Medical Baths, Lonsdale-street, Mel-
bourne, they are doomed as a family. As the
representatives of the fatuous idiocy of bygone
years which-has deified them as possessing a right
to govern the people, never given by the people,
they are dying rapidly, and in order for them or
any gouty or neuralg c martyr like them to save
their bodies they must adopt the course advocated
in this par.*

Squatter Armytage, M.L.A. for Grant, in the Victorian
Assembly, during Federation Bill debate.
Victoria ! how thy aged heart
Will thrill with fervent pleasure
When cablegrams to thee impart
The secret of a—treasure—
A subject, who, for love of thee,
Would gaily to Inferno “ gee.”
Yes, sooner than this Austral land
Should snap the “ silken fetters,”
And ’mongst the nations take her stand
Proclaiming none her betters,
This loyal youth, who loves thee well,
Would lake a berth in deepest hell !
Bright hopes illume the squatter’s breast
And fond anticipation
Of Royal visits to his “ nest ”
To follow Federation.
And shall foul knaves his dreams dispel?
No ! No ! he’d rather go to hell!

Mr. William Smyth, M.L.A.
SENIOR MEMBER FOR GYMPIE QUEENSLAND.
Mb, William Smyth, whose portrait we give in
this notice, is undoubtedly one of the most popular
men on the Gympie goldfields, as also one of the
largest holders in some of the best-paying gold-
mines of Queensland. He was born in Sydney in
1845, and received his education at the school of
the Rev. Mr. Kemmiss, Macquarie-street, the
Rev. A. Boag, of Princess and afterwards Liver-
pool-street, and finally at the Fort-street National
School. Being of a roving and adventurous dis-
position, he chose gold-mining as his avocation,
and at the age of 16 years worked on the Jembai-
cumbene in the Bcaidwood district, and after-
wards at Araluen On the latter field he was
engaged in constructing machinery for raising
water and treating the auriferous earth. On the
decline of that field Mr. Smyth proceeded to
Forbes, and from thence to Grenfell where he
worked with a fair amount of success. The rich
finds at Gympie attracted a number of miners
from the other colonies, amongst others the subject
of our sketch, who arrived in Gympie ip March,
1868. Since then he has experienced the usual
ups and downs incidental to mining life. For
many years he ably managed several of the
principal mines on that field, his thorough
practical knowledge of gold-mining in all
its branches giving him an advantage such
as only a few men possess. As usual with miners,
his surplus earnings went to develop some of the
mines, and for eleven years without success. He,
however, had been steadily paying into the No. 1
North Phoenix, and when payable gold was struck
in this mine Mr. Smyth’s fortune was made. No.
1 North Phoenix is one of the most consistent
dividend-paying gold-mines in Queensland, the
total amount paid in dividends up to date being
£377,500. Mr. Smyth has ably filled the office of
Mayor of the town, having been elected during his
absence from the field. He was elected some
years ago as senior Member for Gympie in the
Liberal interest, and since then has done yeoman
service in representing the wants and requirements
of the electorates. Mr. Smyth is a great enthusi-
ast in the matter of athletic sports in which at
one time he took an active part, he is, further,
exceedingly popular among all native-born Aus-
tralians, and was recently unanimously elected
President of the Australian Natives’ Association.
His brother, Mr. J. J. Smyth has long been iden-
tified with Gunnedah, N.S.W., and has filled the
office of "Mayor of Gunnedah for five years in
succession.

In Perth (W. A.) Supreme Court the other

Hensman is sufficiently long here for you to know

The National Advocate (Bathurst,
N.S.W.) is querulous as to “The Bulletin’s
consistency.” The Bulletin is prepared toargue
the question of its consistency with any man on
earth—except the one man who, after publicly
cursing drink as the devil’s brew that fills The Pit
with lost and wallowing victims, accepted for a
price the secretaryship to the Sydney Bung
Association, and, in that capacity, anathematised
just as liberally and luridly at teetotal fanaticism,
and helped on the glorious cause of drunkenness
and general hell-fire with a zeal exactly propor-
tionate to the dollars paid him. It would be
folly to argue about consistency with a Dissolving
View; the remarks would become too personal.
North and South Queensland appear to be
gradually squeezing out Central Queensland, and
if South Australia reaches out (by extending rail-
way communication from Hergott Springs Junc-
tion to Teeta) for the far western trade, Rock-
hampton will dwindle as a port of irnmediatecom-
mercial importance. Some of the trade that
formerly found exit at Rockhaihpton has already
gone—southwards to Brisbane via Charleville,
and northwards to Townsville, via Hughenden.
Should another stream flow westwards and south-
wards to Hergott Springs and Adelaide, Rock-
hampton will have to wait until the trade of its
own immediate country becomes big enough to
fill its hungry bingie. Central Queensland Separa-
tionigts had better be judiciously diplomatic with
'Premier Griffith in the matter of his scheme of
tripartite autonomous provinces.
George Reid points out that the Broken
Hill Proprietary Mine, Worth ten minions of
pounds sterling to-day and yielding last year one
million pounds, actually pays to the State only
£3O in annual rent. Already in N.S. W, GOO men;
have millions of acres more than the whole
ing 34,000 free-holders. Municipal interests are
confined to but 2000 square miles of territory.
Over 318,000 square miles, Government has
squandered millions of money on behalf of those
who never contribute a farthing a year. Within
62,000 square miles struggling freeholders struggle
hard to keep roofs over their heads, contributing
for every yard of gutter and street in their neigh-
bourhood, while over 308,000 square miles one sees
vast estates, owned by wealthy absentees, sur-
rounded by spacious roads paid for by the masses
of the people, without a single sixpence being con-
tributed in return.
There is a great art in knowing just how
to go bung—to pay your creditors little or nothing
and yet'rake in your own dues. In the Far North
Dobbs keeps a store for Nobbs, but in Dobbs’
own name—say, on a diggings. Nobbs runs
another in some town or city. Dobbs and Nobbs
file their schedules, separately and jointly. Forty
others of their own kidney—all business men with
a leaning towards insolvency—call a meeting and
weep over the firm’s misfortune; big-headed,
windy men get up and say how much good Dobbs
has done for the district, and thunder out curses
on the diggers—customers —because they don’t
get more gold out of the ground and pay Dobbs’
and Nobbs’accounts 17 times over. Also Nobbs
has come-up from town to wind up the firm’s
affairs, and he reads out a list of names that no
one ever heard of before —all good marks, blefs
you ! These book-debts are obviously worth sell-
ing, and Jobbs, confidential-clerk to Nobbs, buys
the same. Dobbs pays in the £, and is feted
by the weeping 40 sympathisers, who let him go
at that. Nobbs goes back to town and gets feted
by blubberers there. Jobbs starts to prosecute
everybody who does owe the firm, and crosses out
of his list the strange names that puzzled the 40
conspirators. Jobbs levies on tents, properties,
leases, and generally cleans out the field, and goes
back to be confidential clerk to Nobbs. Dobbs
starts afresh to do more good for the district.
In reference to enquiries made by The
Bulletin concerning the so-called biography of
Bradlaugh, extracts from which lately appeared in
a Sydney Sunday paper, Mrs. Bradlaugh-Bonner,
writing from London under date 12th June,
says :
Dear Bulletin, —The so-called biography from which
Sydney Truth (!) condescends to publish extracts is a
malicious libel from beginning to end. The alleged pub-
lisher (Gunn) was legally declared non-existent, the'
alleged author (Mackayj went bankrupt, and Mr. Brad-
langh commenced a suit against the really responsible
person (W. Stewart Ross). Just before the case came on
for trial Mr. Ross went to Mr. Bradlaugh s solicitors to
beg that the matter should not be proceeded with. Mr.
Bradlaugh kindly consented to stay proceedings on con-
dition of the legal order of which a copy is subjoined
being made. 1 have reason to believe that an effort is
being made to push the circulation of this libel now that
Mr. Bradlaugh is dead—such is the courage of hisenemies!
—but I have taken legal advice, and, if necessary, I shall
institute proceedings myself, for the manly libellers
thought it consistent with their exalted notions of honour
to vilify even the daughters of the man they hated. lam
writing a short note to the editor of Truth, and I have no
doubt that, if he be an honourable gentleman, he will
apologise for the wanton slander that I really cannot but
think he has inadvertently published. Thanking you for
your letter,— l am, yours sincerely, J. Bradlaugii-Boxner.
Copy -of the legal order made in reference to the
libellous “Life of Charles Bradlaugh,” alleged to have
been written by Chas. H. Mnckay :
“ In the High Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division,
1888, 8., 573. Master in Chambers, the Hon. Robert
Butler. Between Charles Bradlaugh, plaintiff, and Wm,
Stewart Ross, Charles U. Madiuy, and-L. J, Gunn,
defendants.
“Upon hearing the solicitors for the plaintiff and
defendant, William Stewart Ross, it is ordered that upon
the defendant, William Stewart Ross, undertaking to
account to the satisfaction of the plaintiff’s solicitors for,
and destroy within four days, all copies of the book
entitled, ‘The Life of Charles Bradlaugh, M.P.,’ the
above-named plaintiff, containing the alleged libels, tho
subject matter of this action, which have come into his
possession or control; and upon payment in the name of
the plaintiff of the sum of £5O to the treasurer of the
Masonic Boys’ School, at Freemasons’ Tavern, Great Queen-
street, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and the plaintiff’s costs of
this action as against all parties to be taxed as between
solicitor and client, this action be discontinued, and all
further proceedings with regard to the said libels be
stayed, and (on the above terms being carried out) that
the record be withdrawn. It is ordered that the money
deposited for security for costs account by each party be
paid out to the plaintiff on account of the above costs.
Dated tho 15th day of February, 1889.
“P.S.—I may add further that suits were commenced
in respect of the publication of this libel against the Dum-
fries Standard, which paid £lO to the Masonic Boys’
School, made an apology, and paid the costs ; the Scotch
printers of the libel, who paid £25 to the school, made an
apology, and paid the costs ; and the Warrington
Observer, which also paid £25 to the school, expressed
regret, and paid the costs.—J. B. B.”

d the Admiral’s orders combined had taken her
from Balaclava, crammed in every hole and
„ ' r with detachments of various cavalry
raiments, including as many horses as there
was room for, going into winter quarters near
Hit ouaint little Turkish village of the same name
the Gulf The Commissariat and forage had
■ilreadv arrived from the Golden Horn in a smart-
Wikintr barque called the Bomarsund, discharged
a fortnight before, and lying there wind-bound
with 20 straight miles of narrow water between
her and the Marmora, with a due west course to
make, and a steady nine-knot westerly breeze
blowing that never let up night or day for half-
an-hour at a time.
Soldiers and horses were all safely landed
from the Himalaya, a general clean-up was in
urogress under the watchful eye of Rich, the first
lieutenant, and steam was ordered for daylight
the next morning. A dingy pulled by two men
came alongside from the, Bomarsund, and

and came on board. Benjamin Fentland
Priest Commander, R.N., and* captain
of H.M.S. Himalaya, was taking his after-
breakfast walk on the quarter-deck, and reached
the turn near the gangway just as the stranger
arrived, holding in his hand a somewhat dirty
and crumpled-looking letter. The ship’s corporal
was about to interpose, when the freckled man,
with a confidential wave of a massive paw, joy-
fully observed : “ Dom it, mon, I’m in luck after
a’ They tell’t me ashore yonder that ye’d maist
like be awa’ shootin’ ducks. I’m thinkin’ ye’re
the, skipper o’ this craft though, eh?”

“Weel sir! Ou aye, I understand, ye ken.
I’m a skipper raysel’, so you needna be sae stand-
offish. Yon’s ma ship, and here’s a letter tae
VG.
Commander Priest took the unsavoury-looking
document, opened it and read, and as he read he
scowled; then tore it into small fragments, and
pitched them over the side.
44 That’s my answer,” he remarked, and resumed
his walk aft. .
44 Eli! That’s your answer, is it: But, dom
it, it’ll no do me. Are ye gaun’ to tow me out o’
this blavvsted gulf, or are ye no? That’s what I
want to ken, and gin ye pit me on ony o’ your
blawsted airs wi’ me, my mon, 111 just gang ashore
to the Commeesary yonder, and see if he’ll no

By this time Captain Priest had again reached
the gangway “ Silence, sir, and check your
insolent tongue Do you see that flag, and the
pennant over your head ? Her Majesty’s ships are
not at the disposal of any jackanapes of a soldier,
no matter what his rank may be. Leave the ship,
sir. Into your boat, and as quickly as may be.”
“Her Majesty’s ship, indeed. What ah——
o’ a lang tail oor cat’s got! So ye’ll no chuck me
a tow-line, eh? Why, dom it, mon, I’m on Her
Mawjesty’s service as weel as yoursel’. Didna’ I
bring the Commeesary man and the stores doun
to this h fired hole on a contrac’? I was
minded to ask you on to ma ship to dinner the
nicht, but noo I’ll see ye d d first, an’ I’ll jist
gang to the Commeesary and see if he canna’
teach ye ceveelity !”
“ Youngster, tell the master-at-arms to put this
man over the side, and if he doesn’t go quietly to
throw him over !” Saying which, the master of
the situation turned on his heel and went below.
“Dom yer maister-o’-airms and you, too, ye
And just then he was peremptorily helped into
his boat, but the stream of his eloquence was un-
impeded as long as he was within range.
An hour afterwards came a quartermaster with
“ The captain wants you on deck, sir.”
“ Youngster, take the cutter and go on board
the Bomarsund, and find out if there are any men
on board who will volunteer for naval service.”
“ Am I to ask her captain’s permission, sir?”
“ No. Carry out your instructions. Take the
coxswain of the boat on deck with you and turn
the hands up yourself. If there is any inter-
ference return and report.”
The Himalaya was short-handed by about 20
men, some of whom had shortly before been
transferred to the Terrible, while a few had broken
their leave and been left behind at Constan-
tinople.
At the end of about three-quarters of an hour
the cutter returned, and the youngster reported :
“ Boarded the Bomarsund, sir, the captain came
forrard as I was speaking to the bo’sun and
ordered me into the boat—said he’d chuck me oyer
and swamp the boat if I didn’t go at once. Tried
to remonstrate with him, but he refused to
listen.”
“Very good; go back again. Take a file of
marines with you and handcuffs. Carry out your
instructions, and if he again interferes make him
prisoner and bring him here.”
Another hour passed before the cutter returned,
bringing with her on this occasion the wretched
freckled man, held down by the marines in the
bottom of the boat. The youngster reported
“Turned up the hands on the Bomarsund, sir,
nine men volunteer out of sixteen ; say their wages
are overdue and they can get nothing out of the
captain but promises. He went to his cabin for a
rifle and threatened to fire. Made him prisoner,
and he is now in the cutter alongside.”
“Very good; send him aft here. Take the
port life-boat and go back to the Bomarsund and
bring the volunteers and their bags on board.”
And then followed one of the queerest scenes
ever enacted on the deck of one of Her Majesty's
ships. As the freckled red man came aft between
the two marines, and got his eye on his enemy the
fountain of his rage was broken up into separate
torrents of blasphemy and withering denunciation
flowing with a volubility that was in no degree
impaired by the northern burr that emphasized
them. Neither threats nor appeals to his reason
were of any service, and his wind never failed him
for a second. Nobody escaped his notice, and
nothing between Heaven and Sheol got left out,
and still he wouldn’t stop, but just struggled, and
bit, and kicked, until he was sent below, where
he finally was put in irons and gagged. At the
end of an hour he was all right again, signed
an order on his Constantinople agents for the
men’s wages—which was duly honoured ' on pre-
sentation-kicked over a tray on which a steward
handed him a tumbler and the needful, rushed
down the ladder into the ship’s dingy offered for
his return, and with one last blood-curdling curse
for the Himalaya from truck to kelson, and
everybody in her, finishing with an awful swear
to destroy yon “ commeesary ” man, root and
branch for having made “ sic-like a d——d fule o’
him,” we parted for ever. The Himalaya steamed
westward at sunrise the following morning, leaving
the Bomarsund to wait for a change of wind and
another crew. Whether his curses came home to
roost, who can tell? Up to date the old ship
doesn’t look any the worse for them.

The Bulletin’s London correspondent
says that the Savage Club, having emerged
triumphantly from its monetary troubles, is now,
under Sir Somers Vine, about to cast off the last
shred of Bohemianism. No more frayed linen is
to be seen in the Club, and several poor and lowly
members have been sacrificed at the shrine of
Respectability up to date. A new departure has
just been made‘in the shape of “ ladies’nights,”
after the manner of the Lyric and Meistersingers.
The first essay was a success, and the innovation
will be popular with a certain section of the
members. The “old hands,” however, shake
their heads, and begin to regret the ancient days
in the Savoy and elsewhere, ere the Savages
became So intensely respectable.
W. S. Gilbert now sits as an honorary
magistrate on the Middlesex Bench.—
The impoverished thief
Who has stolen some beef,
Or the boy who has snavelled a filbert,
Must twang a guitar
When he stands at the bar
To be tried by the humorous Gilbert,
And plead for his pity
By singing a ditty—
Perhaps, though, a pun would be properer
(The song, or the pun,
Being certainly one
From a Gilbert and Sullivan opera).
Then the author would say—
“ Little nut, run away
And buy a lot more with this money,”
And would offer relief
To a filcher of beef
Who was doing his best to be funny.
For, though the sharp claw
Of a merciless law
Must seize on the people who purloin,
Sure, a quip or a song
Can atone for what’s wrong
In the theft of a filbert or sirloin.
O ! picture the joy
Of the man and the boy—
Both indulging in jubilant dances,
And shouting “ Hip ! hip !”
When permitted to skip
On the magistrate's recognizances.
The “ peelers ” and “traps ”
Would be swearing,,perhaps,
That they never had heard such a din afore,
And want it subdued,
But the show would conclude
With the “Englishman’s” chorus from “Pinafore.,”
A Socialism under ruling commercial conditions
—the Co-operative Irrigation Colonies.
Police-Inspector Lewis, of Brisbane, who
formed the first police-station on Gympie Creek,
in ’67, and left Gympie in ’68, with the promise
that he would revisit it by the first train, had the
pleasure of fulfilling his vow the other day.
The general secretary of the Y.M.C.A.
reports : “ There are over 7,000,000 young men in
America to-day, of whom over 5,000,000 never
darkened a church door. Seventy-five out of
every hundred of these j'oung men do not attend
church ; ninety-five out of every hundred do not
belong to church, and ninety-seven out of every
hundred do nothing to spread Christianity.”
And, he might have added, out of the five who do
go to church, two or thereabouts go to gaol for
mean and hypocritical offences.
The late Edwin Long’s “A Question of
Propriety” is about the most valuable, and cer-
tainly the best-bought, picture in the Melbourne
Gallery. It is the original, snapped off the easel'
for £300 before he painted a larger edition of the
same subject for the Reyal Academy show. A
wonderful bargain this, as compared with the
“ Esther ” replica, which hangs on the opposite
wall and cost, in a then rising market, £1600.
Long’s pictures have fetched wonderful prices, at
times. Holloway, of pill celebrity, paid £8000 for
“The Babylonian Marriage Market ” to adorn his
noble sanatorium for lunatics, although the
wisdom of selecting such a spicy subject to interest
minds diseased was rather doubtful. Of late the
critics have been complaining that Long was too
fond of painting naked young ladies and palming;
them off as lofty Scriptural conceptions.
“Tommy” has a selection six miles from
a rising town on the River Darling. Whenever
“ Ted,” who lives further afield, makes for the
-town, he invariably calls at Tommy’s to break the
journey, generally arriving at about 2 o’clock in
the morning, when his habit is to quietly disrobe
and climb over the sleeping Tommy and bunk
“ inside ” him without ceremony. Now, recently,
another friend of Tommy wived, and Tommy lent
his selection to the honeymooning couple. Of
this fact, Ted was totally ignorant. During the
honeymoon time, Ted journeyed townwards and
pulled up as usual at Tommy’s, taking the horses
out of his buggy and entering the house and bed-
room as he was accustomed to. Not wishing to
disturb Tommy, he refrained from striking a
light, disrobed in the dark, and-—well, you can ’
fill in the rest of the story to suit yourself.

The benevolent - asylums and destitute homes are
crowded, and matjy bid people, whose only crime is
poverty, are weekly sent to the gaols to herd with crimi-
nals, that they may not die in the streets.— Melbourne
Daily Paper.
Gentles, we pray you of your charity
That ye give ear to this our piteous case,
For neither food, nor wherewithal have we
To clothe this flesh that here we do abase.
Chill after chill through all our bodies chase ;
And these our features that were once so fair,
Now shrunken are and nipt in winter air.
Here bowed we stand as men who are forlorn.
Let none revile us, no one mock our care—
To this may come all men of women born.
Rich men that in fine chariots happily
Do vie with Father Time his rapid pace,
From out thy fulness, e’en though scantily,
Give crumbs that may put in us heart of grace.
Turn thou our footsteps from this sorry place ;
Much dearth have we that pray this humble
prayer,
Much dearth of hope, much fulness of despair.
Full well we know the biting jibe, the scorn
Of upstart Pride—Oh, fellow man, beware !
To this may come all men of women born.
Why is it crime that these eyes cannot see?
That ploughed and furrowed is this wrinkled
face ?
That after many years spent righteously
Come hard affliction, sorrow, and disgrace?
Send us not into prisons ’mong the base,
‘Mid rogues and murderers to perish there.
Look on these palsied limbs, this whitened hair,
Mark thou these shrinking forms by anguish
worn-
Out of thy human heart some pity share,
To this may come all men of women born.
Croesus, who doth ’gainst future woe prepare
With heaped gold, thy gems and jewels rare
Shall naught console thee when thy heart is torn ?
Feed thou the hungry, clothe the beggar bare—
To this may come all men of women born.

Grim as the goblin of some German story—
How weird and grey
Thou look’st, up there, against the face of day I
Thou wert not wont to love the morning's glory ;
Toy greeting to the sun’s not con amore.
Dismiss that comic look of apprehension
From off thy phiz ;
A queer, uncanny countenance it is ;
Dread not the sequel of my brief perpension J
There is no ill to thee in my intention.
What! still to me thy dubious gaze directed ?
Take heart of grace!
I love thee for thy philosophic face !
Fear not, I say ! —against thy ribs respected
No lead from this dark tube shall be projected.
Strange are the fancies that thou dost awaken 1
Perhaps, in thee,
Be-inoarnation of some sage we see ;
Thou might’st for any of the tribe be taken.
Shoot thee?— shoot Plato, Socrates, or Bacon !
And yet, no doubt, for all thy reverend seeming,
Thou’st hopes and fears,
And cares, and quarrels, and marsupial dears.
Perchance, e’en now, thy rivals thou’rt blaspheming ;
Perchance not far from thee thy “love lies dreaming.”
Perchance thou’rt wedded, and dost fear a sermon
From anxious mate,
For lingering thus unconscionably late;
Perchance—thy looks suggest the wig and ermine—
Thou hast some complex question to determine.
Perchance—but hold ! a truce to these “perchances 1”
The sun grows high ;
Thou hast a snug cubiculum close by—
If right I read thy surreptitious glances ;
A chambre-A-coucher, the phrase in France is.
Come ! get thee to it, and my Muse befriend
(’Tis sometimes hard to frame a neat conclusion),
By leaving her to make a timely end
Of this effusion!
ALEX. MONTGOMERY.
A lot of old New Zealanders, now residing
in Sydney, with a poetic imagination which would
do credit to a first-class brickbat—not to speak of
the Banjo, or any of his kidney—have discovered
a spot in our midst which they say can knock
spots out of Rotomahana or any other of the hot
lakes in Maoriland. It is—and the information is
certainly well worth knowing by the general
public— not situated in the Blue Mountains, at the
head of the Murray, or far away in the West; but
in prosy Pitt-st., Sydney, close to the Haymarket.
There, rejoicing in the euphonious cognomen of the
Natatorium, they find that, spite of winter winds,
they can luxuriate daily in the soft pleasures of a
swim in a bath (to which that of the famous
Hinemoa is as the family wash-tub to the trans-
lucent depths of the briny blue) whose waters are
for ever invitingly warm. The proprietors of
this unique establishment have indeed solved a
problem, which should gain them not only the
thanks of a grateful community, but also secure to
them an endless procession of would-be bathers
through its doors. By means, which need not be
described here, the water of the baths at The
Natatorium is always at? a temperature 0f,95°, and
persons who hitherto have been unable to get their
daily dip at this, season, owing to the inclement
weather, can now bathe in comfort throughout
the year. The very novelty of swimming in warm
sea water is'sufficient in itself to draw a crowd.*

What’s wrong with Jamberoo ?
At Bendigo (Vic.), the other day, a man
who had seduced a one-eyed woman and was
living with her, gave way to irritation, and banged
her on the'head with a stone. Ho knocked out
her other eye, leaving her totally blind, and the
law rose to the occasion and gave him one year—
we mean one month. The person who got the one
year was an old man with “no visible means of
support.” Any individual who wants a month’s
board and lodging to see him through the cold
weather will please take the hint, and knock out
the* eye of a Bendigo magistrate.
“The monetary crisis which has existed

Mabel Collins, who for a year was Madame
Blavatsky’s colleague in the editorship of Lucifer,
thus writes of her late chief
And yet Ido not regret having known her. She was so
extraordinary a woman. She taught me one great lesson :
1 learned from her how foolish, how “gullible,” how
easily flattered human beings are, taken en masse. Her
contempt for her kind was on the same gigantic scale as
everything else about her, except her marvellously deli-'
cate taper fingers. In all else she was a big woman ; she
had a greater capacity for making black appear white, a
larger waist, a more voracious appetite, a more confirmed
passion for tobacco, a more ceaseless and insatiable hatred
of those whom she thought to be her enemies, a greater
disrespect for les convenances, a worse temper, a greater
command of bad language, and a greater contempt for
the intelligence of her fellow-beings, than I had ever sup-
posed possible to be contained in one person. These, I
suppose, must be reckoned as her vices, though whether
a creature so indifferent to all ordinary standards of right
and wrong can be held to have virtues or vices I know
not. . . . I commenced by being interested in her pro-
fessed knowledge of magic, and very curious about her
greater pretensions. I ended by arriving at a condition of
wonder at her genius in charlatanry, her sublime confi-
dence in herself, her contempt for everyone else. I
sometimes think the intensity of this contempt confused
people and made them foolish. I have seen her, by the
simplest sleight of hand, produce new American stamps,
and fresh sovereigns, and clean bank-notes, the newness
about them being a proof of her just having created them
or drawn them out of the vastness of the infinite being -
to the positive conviction of apparently intelligent wit-
nesses. I have known her profess to read sealed letters
by the help of her psychic powers, and make shrewd
business men think she had done so, when a mere child,
not under her spell, would have pointed out that these
same letters and a hot-water jug had had ample oppor-
tunity for making each other's acquaintance, with her
kind assistance. I have known her intimidate a whole
gathering of (at other times) sensible persons by the sim-
ple announcement that she could see her “master”'
standing among them, and that he was very angry.
I have heard from different sources that some
very strange revelation about Madame Blavatsky
would bo heard after her death. There are persons iii
different countries in possession of documents and letters
which are to be published in due course, so it has
always been said. I hope this may be so. Her own
letters, if collected and printed, would be curious; and
would bo a valuable lesson to those who are likely to b
fascinated or flattered by an intellectual syren. Not that
another so great is likely to arise among us in this
century. Many, however, will be interested to know,
once for all, whether this mystic individual was an
adventuress pure and simple, or whether she was, as
some believe, a political spy* or agent, who used the cloak
of a religious movement to cover her actions, and made
a set of fanatics the unconscious 1 arbourers of a few
political intriguers in any centre she lived in. It would
lie impossible for anyone who knew h:r for so short a
time as I did to form any opinion as to this. Whatevei
the vital motive of her charlatanry was, it was marvel
lously audacious and entirely unscrupulous. A romantic'
and infamous career is closed, and now that she is dead,
we who have lost any of our illusions with her, can only
say, “ Peace be to her soul.”
This all strengthens the original impression (it
grew as days went on) which we formed on meet-
ing our late visitor, Colonel Olcott—that he was
a softy. It is on record that Blavatsky used to
bully him in public.
Spurgeon tells a good one. A reverend
gentleman in East London was remonstrated with
for not converting the thieves and harlots of his
parish. “Ah,” said he, “my congregation would
be too poor to support them !”
“ Rev. H. L. Jackson considered that r
clergyman should take his part in the doings of
the world, and he saw no harm in visiting the
theatre. . . . Rev. A. R. Bartlett was with
Mr. Jackson, and he explained that on the steamer
which brought him from England were some
good actors, the brightest and most helpful per-
sons on board ship. At the Sunday services more
attentive and reverent listeners could not be
found.” They were good actors, perhaps.
Here—we quote from the Manchester
(Eng.) Sunday Chronicle—are The Bulletin’s
sentiments, though we perhaps have never suc-
ceeded in putting the case so neatly ;
The Chronicle cannot be more correctly called a labour
organ than a sporting organ, or a Socialist organ, or a
publicans’ organ, or a party organ. Our paper is not
bound to the chariot-wheels of any person or party, and
we object to any label whatever. We advocate Socialism,
though I believe our staff are mainly strong Indi-
vidualists ; for we consider Socialism would prove most
advantageous to the rank and file of humanity, and sink
our own preference for the general good. You will
invariably find the Chronicle on the weaker side, and so
we are on the side of the labourer. But if the labourer
had the courage to use his electoral power, as he could
and should, for his own advantage, we should most likely
then be found pleading the cause of down-trodden dukes,
and agitating for the amelioration of the lot of miserable
marquises and blighted baronets.
An English physician writes: “I draw a
distinction between inaccuracy and untruth.
Women are often inaccurate because they are
emotional. They describe sensations rather than
relate facts, but this is a constitutional, not a
moral, fault.” If, say, Mrs. Crawford didn't
quite tell the truth in the Dilke case, her fault
was not a moral but a constitutional defect. In
other words, she was constitutionally immoral.
And so in a recent memorable breach-of-promise
case at Sydney ; and if in the Gordon-Cumming
case, any one of the lady-witnesses didn’t stick to
solemn fact, we must excuse her on the ground of
the defect in her constitution. Woman as a liar has
wonderful privileges. She is more readily
believed, especially when she is at all good-
looking, than man, and her little perjuries when
detected are written down as constitutional
defects which the man whom she sends to gaol
must pity, inasmuch as they cannot fairly be
resented.
GOOD OLD CRISIS!
The light is coming by degrees;
Now money with the Portuguese
At such a price is
That European monarchs fear
Another crown may disappear.
0, good old Crisis !
It was but yesterday Brazil
Declined to fill Don Pedro’s till :
He couldn’t ’tico his
Beloved subjects from revolt;
The sodgers turned, lie had to bolt.
0, good old Crisis !
Queen V. upon her English throne
Sits sad at heart, which cold as stone,
Or e’en as ice, is :
Her brow is black, her temper vext,
She wonders who’ll be going next.
0, good old Crisis !
The Czar reflects, with visage white,
How one attacked by dynamite
Gone in a trice is :
Young Wilhelm is uneasy, too —
What might the German army do
In good old Crisis ?
The pert and puny King of Spain’s
No doubt employed in “ playing trains ”
His taffy nice is ;
To purple born, a baby king,
He doesn’t dream, poor, ickle sing !
Of good old Crisis !
King Otto’s off his head, they say,
And peeling ’takers all the day
His only vice is ;
With politics quite out of touch,
He wouldn’t be affected much
By good old Crisis.
But nowadays, ’twill be allowed,
The outlook for the royal crowd
(To be precise) is
Dam bad; the nations of the earth
Are not impressed with royal worth—
O, good old Crisis !
A time will come (as in the play
The heavy villain likes to say),
And onr advice is—
Just wait a bit, content to know
That all the lot are bound to go.
O, good old Crisis !

Two Men Wrong—One Man Right.
“ You will he in kingdom-come in less than twelve
months 1 ”
“ You can’t live three years ! ” •
“ You are not going to die ! ”
These three prophecies were addressed to the
same man. The last one had the most comfort in
it, yet he couldn’t tell which had the most inspira-
tion.
Here’s the story. It isn’t pleasant reading at
first, but it “ comes out ” all right, as the children
say.
Perhaps it’s better to let our friend tell it him-
self. We all like the pronoun “I,” that’s why
an autobiography is never dull. This relator is a
butcher of Auckland, N. Z., and Ids style is so
clear and good, it needs no editing.
He says : “ Some five years ago, when lifting a
quarter of beef, I noticed a remarkable soreness in
the small of my back. I called a doctor, gave up
business, and took to my bed. He prescribed a
lotion to be rubbed in around the region of the
kidneys. This was done, and I remained in bed
several days, suffering exerntiating agony. At
last, having examined the kidney secretions, the
doctor-said, ‘You have Bright’s disease, and will
he in kingdom-come in less than twelve months.’
“Never believing I had Bright’s disease, I
thought, however, it would be as well to insmo
my life. On examination, the company’s physician
refused to pass me for life insurance, saying,
‘Yon can't live three years.’
“ About three months afterwards I was again
seized with a severe attack, and went about more
dead than alive. Finally I broke down and again
took to my bed, as was supposed, for the last
time. I sold one of my businesses so as not to
leave too many affairs for my wife to snnervise, 1
made my will, and explained to my wife what to
do in case of my death. I can well remember her
listening vith tears in her eyes to what she be-
lieved were my last instructions. I then lingered
for some weeks, waiting for death to free me from
my sufferings—taking whatever medicines were
prescribed, but deriving little or no relief.
“One evening a friend called, and wo talked
over my case and the very serious turn it had
taken. Presently he said, ‘ Yon aro not going to
die. Have you tried Seigei’s Syrup yet ? ’
“I confessed that I had not. In fact, I had
religiously followed the instructions of my medical
advisers. My friend persuaded me to try Seigel's
Syrup, and I began at once, taking twenty-drop
doses according to the directions. In about a
week I felt a little more life in me, and after
having finished the second bottle I was convinced
that improvement had fairly set in. I continued
taking the Syrup until I had consumed ten bottles,
then went downstairs to work again, still using
the Syrup. After having taken from eighteen to
twenty bottles altogether, I found myself entirely
well. It is now four years since I took my last
dose of Mother Seigel’s Syrup for Bright’s disease
of the kidneys, arid I have suffered no symptoms
of kidney complaint since.
“(Signed) Robert Hutchinson, Butcher.
Wellington-street, Auckland, New Zealand.”
We print Mr. Hutchinson’s statement as ho
wrote it, yet it is not probable that his malady
was actually Bright’s disease, as that is a degenera-
tion or destruction of the substance of the kidneys, j
and difficult, if not impossible, to cure. What he
really suffered from was, no doubt, a debilitated
state of the system, originating in indigestion and
dyspepsia, with severe kidney symptoms, as is often
the case. When we remember that nearly all
maladies, including rheumatism, gout, consump-
tion, liver complaint, heart disease, &c., are due
to poisons in the blocd, arising from fermented
food in the digestive tract, we can see why Mother
Seigel’s Syrup is victorious over so great a variety
of apparently diverse diseases. And because of
the one source of these complaints, serious and
often fatal mistakes are made in the diagnosis and
in the treatment. The point to emphasise is this :
Heart disease, consumption, and Bright’s disease
are much rarer than they arc supposed to he.
Generally what seems like them is a group of
symptoms of indigestion and dyspepsia. It is
always best to take the advice of Air. Hutchinson’s
friend when he said, “Yon are not going to die ;
try Seigel's Syrup.”

The P, and (). Co. are lengthening their
two well-known steamers, the Rome and the
Carthage, and giving them entirely different bow
lines. They expect to be able to drive them at an
average of something like two knots an hour
faster than they have been driven up to the
present time, without any increase in the cost of
fuel.
The counters produced in Court in the
baccarat case were not those belonging to
“ Wales,” but were specially made for the purpose
of the trial. It was hoped at one time, says
I igaro, that the question of the ownership of the
counters would have been avoided. The Prince’s
own counters are stamped with the crown and
feathers. They form part of the furniture of a
case fitted up with the appurtenances for all the
games of the board. The case was a present to
Turn, from Alfred de Rothschild.
It is stated that there is an unrepealed
law of Charles II. still in existence, by which a
man who is hungry and dead-broke can go into
anybody’s premises, and after furnishing reason-
able evidence of his condition can eat as much as
he is able to hold. This old statute wants to be
looked up at once.
The question concerning the origin of the
word “Toowoomba” is thus conclusively settled
by Archibald Meston, of Brisbane. He says:
“Toowoomba” is a word in the dialect of the
“ Gqooeeburra ” or “Fire Blacks” of the
Darling Downs, who spoke “Wakka.” It is
derived from “Toowoom,” the name of a small
native melon which grew prolifically in the
Toowoomba Valley. The terminal “ba” is
equivalent to the adverb “there,” and the whole
word to a Gooneeburra black would mean “ the
place where we g t the Toowoom.” Toowoomba
is one of the few native names spelled exactly as
pronounced ly t ho old blacks and by the sur-
vivors of to-day.

Rev. Brewster, at a recent clerical
conference, thinks that “ Parsons should visit
their people, not for the purposes of going to the
theatre or playing a friendly game of whist.
This is quite out of the line of the work of the
Church, as it is not calculated to raise men
morally.” Yet a good many parsons induce their
flocks every Sunday to indulge in “threepenny
nap. ”
The Broken Hill Proprietary lode (N.S. W.)
is 39G0ft. long and 10,5ft. wide, or a little wider
than Collins-t treet, Melbourne. Taking the depth
at 300ft., its owners have yet rooted out only one-
seventh of the contents of the lode, or 74G tons of
silver.
Barlow’s Pharmacy Act Amendment Bill?
summarily slaughtered by the Queensland
Assembly, the other day, proposed to permit all
pharmaceutists holding certificates of any Aus-
tralian co’ony to practise in Queensland. At pre-
sent, a duly-qualified chemist of Victoria is a
trade pariah in Queensland and must be re-
apprenticed for three years and re-examined
locally. Similarly with N.S.W. and S.A. This
is a condition of unf- derated dry rot, but the lines
of reciprocity are being daily drawn closer,
though the Victorian body of poisoners claim that
their test of examination is higher than that of
any of the sister provinces.
According to Burrum Powers, 3000 copies
of the interdicted Dead Bird were once smuggled
through the post into Queensland, each wrapped
up inside a War Cry. This was neat, but it’s a
question whether the Cry isn’t the more
“blasphemous ” publication of the two.
Dr. Barnardo’s show boys appear at

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Pu'iry.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics,
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin wai
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
arm has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established .Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightast
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, ISBS.
To H. F. Kugf.lmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last 1 began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in ray left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted yon, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two,pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
