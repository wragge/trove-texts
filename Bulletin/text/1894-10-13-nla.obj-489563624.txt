Pretty Frosers.
The English language has the defects of its qualities. Macaulay made its best
eulogy when he said that in force, in richness, in aptitude for all the highest purposes
of the poet, the philosopher, and the orator, it is inferior to the tongue of Greece
alone. Now that science has complicated thought, even Greek must cede it pre-
cedence. For emotional speech the languages of Southern Europe are better fitted;
but the evolution of tongues has produced for the writer no intellectual instrument
so noble as English. Yet it cannot be played with. You must take it seriously, as
you take the British matron—-in whose severe shape, indeed, a sculptor might fitly
idealise it. In the most delicious love-transports, an Englishwoman seems always
on the point of saying her prayers; and English is the finest language
in the world to say one’s prayers in. Like its feminine type, it is too proper, too
rigid, too formal ;it has an uneasy sense of its own dignity; it hovers continually on
the brink of anti-climax. It is a machine which goes when you wind it up, not clay
which lives to the touch of the modeller. You cannot throw up your cap and be a
boy with it, for it interrupts one as awkwardly as Mrs. Shandy. Its wardrobe is
incomplete : it has innumerable morning suits, evening suits, and even tourist suits ;
but never yet has English felt at home in dressing-gown and slippers. Once, when
Lamb persisted, it attempted to try them on, but how obvious its discomfort! with
what x elief it donned again its starched shirt and chimney-pot ! And Mrs. Grundv
never liked Lamb.
Men of other nations feel the force, the breadth, the majesty of English, yet find
it ponderous and dull. It is brawny enough, and full enough; but (in spite of
A\ hitman) it is not limber enough. It can uproot a tree, but it cannot pick up a
pin .it can forge an ironclad, but it cannot crack a nut. Madame de Stael com-
plained that English was monotonous : its beauties were , all melancholy : one would
think the English clouds had colored it and the English waves had made its harmo-
nies. How different Italian—-shining like a holiday ! echoing like those musical
instruments which people have compared to scarlet ! Then Southerners suffer serious
distress from superfluous English sibilants. Charles the Fifth antithetically said
that Spanish was a tongue for gods, and English for geese. French he kept for
one s mistress. And readers of Dumas will remember that D’Artagnan only con-
sented to stay in London on condition that he should not be made to' learn English.
This is not wholly Gallic prejudice, for unfamiliarity turns many of our ill-spelt
words into cacophonous monstrosities. Without entering the nightmare-realm of
polysyllables, look, for instance, at words like “struggle,” “kitchen,” “satisfy”—
dissociating them from their meaning and regarding them as one would regard
unknown words in a foreign language. There are thousands of similar terms which
old custom has made sufficiently sweet to us, but which to strangers appear horribly
harsh and uncouth.
sibilants, short vowels, and consonant-collocations make it impossible to get the
color and vivacity of French prose into English, whatever the dexterity of a De
Quincey may do for its melody. English cannot causer ; The articles in London
journals meet you with a stiff bow, or, at most, a friendly nod ; while Parisian articles
are smiling, chattering, and shaking both your hands in eager welcome. The
learning is generally on the foggy side of the Channel; but how gladly would we
barter some of it for the sunshine of free-and-easy grace ! Compare, for example,
Pater with Sainte-Beuve—the style of the one Galatea in marble, of the other
Galatea warm with life. Yet there is nowadays noticeable a stronger English
striving after delicacy and lightness of touch. Some of the sketches in the Speaker
and National Observer are models of literary form. R. L. Stevenson, who has
penned some of the prettiest prose in the language, is closely followed by J. M.
Barrie, Quiller Couch, and Barry Pain, gifted with more than Addisonian felicity of
diction. Gilbert Parker is less perfect; but Richard Le Gallienne brings a poet’s
hand to write his “ Book Bills ” and his « Fancies,” and Grant Allen is an admirable
interpreter of the technicalities of science. The books mentioned below, of course,
appeal rather to cultured than to common tastes, and should only be bought by
people with a fine sense of sub-tones and side-aspects. For such they are classics.
“ VIRGINTBUS PUERISQUE,” by R. L. Stevenson. Cloth, 6s. 6d.
Essays now well-known, but as fresh as Spring, and perennially charming.
“MY LADY NICOTINE,” by J. M. Barrie. Cloth, 6s. 6d.
A book chief among ten thousand and altogether lovely. One is almost inclined
to retract aspersions on the English language, seeing what delicate humor it is
capable of translating. The smoker who has not read it has not smoked.
“ NOUGHTS AND CROSSES,” by T. Quiller Couch. Cloth, 6s. 6d.
Surely the quaintest, sweetest stories ever penned, with art reaching its acme
in deliciously subtle simplicity.
“IN A CANADIAN CANOE,” by Barry Pain. Cloth, 4s.
Sketches, verses and stories varying in merit, but with keen thought and a
clever style at the back of all.
“ PROSE FANCIES,” by Richard Le Gallienne. Cloth, 6s. 6d.
A recent book of idyllic essays, throwing the glamour of imagination over the
desert of commonplace, and transmuting lead to gold by the alchemy of exquisite
prose. “ A Borrowed Sovereign ” should be read at least six times.
“ POST-PRANDIAL PHILOSOPHY,” by Grant Allen. Cloth, 4s.
In these articles Grant Allen brings his scientific knowledge and scientific train-
ing to bear effectively on subjects of the day. He is invariably clear and suggestive,
and his tendencies make always for progress. And he tells us, by-the-by, in an essay
on “ The Struggle for Life among Languages ”
“ By the middle of the twentieth century, in all probability, English will be the world’s
dominant speech ; and the English-speaking peoples, a heterogeneous conglomerate of all
nationalities, will control between them the destinies of mankind. Spanish will be the
language of half the populous southern hemisphere. Russian will spread over a moiety of
Asia. Chinese, Malay, Arabic, will divide among themselves the less civilised parts of
Africa and the East. But French, German, and Italian will be insignificant and dwindling
European dialects, as numerically unimportant as Flemish or Danish in our day.”
Thus, in the stern prose of existence, utility conquers esprit.
NOTE.—As rnosi of the books mentioned are in strong demand, some may
be temporarily out of stock. In such case, orders will be filed, and the books
forwar. ed immediately on arrival of next shipment.
Wicked Woman Books.

Suggestive, and rather dull.
“THE YELLOM ASTER,” by lota. Cloth, 317 pp.; 6s. 6d.
A smart and amusing book.
“DODO,” by E. F. Benson. Cloth, 441 pp.; 6s. 6d.
An excellent presentment of the Very Newest Woman.
“ KEYNOTES,” by George Egerton. Cloth, 4s. 3d.
Subtly, shamelessly audacious ; the cleverest and most unblushing of all.
Listen, for example, to “my maid Belinda ” :
“ She is one bump of philo-progenitiveness, but she hates men. She says : ‘lf one
could only have a child, ma m, without a husb&nd or the disgrace ; ugh, the disgusting
men ! Do you know, 1 think that is not an uncommon feeling amongst a certain number
°f women. I have known many, particularly older women, who would give anything in
God s world to have a child of ‘ their own ’ if it could be got iust as Belinda says, ‘ without
the horrid man or the shame.’ ”
Pleasant reading this for poor brow-beaten Man ! Lucky it’s “if.”

The Queensland Grammar School system
is receiving a naaty knock from the present Govt.
At present the Grammar Schools are in receipt of
a handsome yearly endowment from the State
and 16 guineas per annum in addition for every
scholarship pupil in attendance. It is now pro-
posed, however, to make the first endowment pay
for the scholarship granted, so that the second
allowance of 16 guineas per head will be withheld.
Whereat the rich parent is wrathful, for it simply
means that he will have to pay out of his own
pocket the cost of the superior educational pap
purveyed for his offspring, inasmuch as aforesaid
endowment is insufficient.
The Bulletin lately chronicled the slimy
absurdity of one Szlumper, Mayor of Richmond
(Eng.), in sending telegrams of congratulation to
the Queen and her nearest relatives re the birth of
the York baby. Szlumper got his reward. The
Queen journeyed to Richmond to attend the
christening of that precious infant, and Szlumper
waylaid her at the railway-station with an
address. The claims of Szlumper having by this
time become firmly embedded in the royal brain
he was knighted in the usual manner. Szlumper
and J. B. Patterson are now of equal distinction,
but Szlumper has the better chance of achieving
further greatness before he dies,
Mr. Owen, a Brisbane sui’geon, relates, in
the current issue of the Australian Medical
Gazette, how, in Dec. ’B7, he removed a large
par-ovarian cyst from a Mrs. S., a lady 79 years
and 10 months, who for some years remained the
oldest case ever operated on. As time went on,
however, it was exceeded ; Dr. Herbert Spencer
recording one of 82 years and two months, and
also Mr. Bush another in Her 85th year. In ’93,
Mrs. S. again consulted Mr. Owen, and another
rapidly-growing tumor was diagnosed. At first
the surgeon rather ridiculed any operative inter-
ference ; but not so the patient, who, when she
distinctly understood it was an ovarian tumour,
called'her family together, they acting as jury,
she as judge, the verdict being “ that as her life
had become a burden through the size of the
tumor, and she had survived one operation, there
was no reason why she should not survive a
second.” So the doctor again operated with com-
plete success and the old lady is now well.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
Cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
GUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, CuticurA Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
CuticurA, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive-of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25 c.

While We May:
A Moral from “ Oil Bias."
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Comrades in many a revel,
O’er many a sparkling glass,
You remember the tale the Devil
Told to Don Oleophas !
A painter and music-master
Like brothers lived here on earth;
If one of them owned a piastre.
Then both made gallant mirth.
When toil worn folk were taking
Their rest, these spirits bright
With merry old songs were shaking
The rafters black of night.
If Care tried in their revel
To join, with humour fine,
They sent him back to the Devil,
Carolling-drunk with wine.
Time never so gaily passes
As when he is cheered along
With glorious clink of glasses,
And story, and jest, and song!
But he sends his bill in duly,
And these two comrades tried,
Like the King who reigned in Thule,
Their last cup drank and died.
They met Below soon after,
But not as in days before —
Dead was the old-time laughter,
They knew each other no more.
What is the moral ? Marry,
The moral is this, I think—
While here on the earth we tarry
Oh, let the canakin clink !
V. J. Daley.
In Melbourne there is a barber named
Taylor whose next-door neighbour is a tailor named
Shave.
For adultery in Portugal the wife is sen-
tenced to eight years’ cellular confinement with
hard labor, and her paramour is similarly
punished. A husband guilty of adultery is fined
£2. The philosophy of it: (1) Every woman
knows who is the father of her child. (2) No man
can swear who is the father of his wife’s child.
For breach-of-promise defendants. At
Liverpool a postman was sued by Miss Winters, a
barmaid. His defence was that he was in bad
health and had only one lung, and that, therefore
—for the good of the race, presumably—he should
not marry. On this defence, the jury promptly
nonsuited the plaintiff. If this is to be a legal
precedent, then for the future Angelina before

pertinent questions ; “ How many lungs have you,
and how are you generally ?”
Why should a sea-serpent be always repre-
sented as swimming above the water ? The Gulf
of Carpentaria abounds in yellow sea-snakes,
sometimes nearly 6ft. long. They invariably swim
just beneath the surface of the water, and but for
the elevation of a vessel’s deck would rarely be
seen. They certainly could not be seen from a
low shore. It was Saturday afternoon when the
last big sea-serpent was seen.

Kaiser William evidently regards his poo r
father’s brief reign as an incident which didn’t
count with the Almighty. His bloodthirsty old
grandsire and himself were both of them created
for the purpose of wearing the crown of Germany,
as he recently stated for the fifteenth time. But
the intervening monarch with the cancerous
throat—well, he simply held a commission from
Heaven to keep the crown aired in the meantime.

Messrs. Winchcombe, Carson and Co., of
Sydney, opened their new wool-stores at Wattle-
street, Pyrmont, theotherday, with theaccustotmed
festivity. The premises are built on a novel plan,
being two storeys high instead of the customary
five or six, and running into breadth and length
rather than height. The lower floor—the one
on which the banquet was held —looks like
the very biggest apartment in all Sydney,
and the table which was laid in one
corner was suggestive of a sandwich left
all alone in a cathedral. Premier Reid was
present on the occasion, and after lunch he rose
and exploded, apropos of nothing in particular, in
a violent burst of fury against the Leg. Council.
Premier Reid is not a very large man, and when
he pranced about indignantly in one far corner, of
the huge, lonesome room he might have been an
ant using strong language in a fortress. When a
very middle-sized man proposes to let himself
loose he should pick his building more carefully;
it is only a person of great presence who can
look impressive in an empty wool-store. U.S.
Consul Bell, who was also present, made an
elaborate joke on the subject of wool, but
his best effect was when he addressed himself to
the young Australian and wanted to know what
he meant by alluding to England as “Home.”
The home of the Australian, as he justly remarked,
is Australia and nowhere else, and if he hasn’t
dropped to that rudimentary fact then he hasn’t
even begun the work of nation-making. And with
this great truth ringing in its ears, the company
drank several toasts, and then went and lost itself
in the vast wilderness of floor while looking for
the exit.

The War Scare.
Last week the periodical war-scare broke
out in an aggravated form, and for twenty-
four hours or so various London papers were
frantically challenging France to “ come on ”
and be utterly extinguished. No one knew,
and no one knows, or is likely to know, what
the trouble was really about. The only pos-
sible visible cause of the sudden riot which
arose out of the midst of a dead calm the
that France was vaguely alleged to have
“designs ” upon Madagascar, and on was
strength of this or some other rumour the
Jingo press furiously threatened to fill five
continents with blood and devastation.
Madagascar is not, and never was, British
territory, and Britain does not even profess
to have any shadow of a claim on that
troubled isle. She has no “ interests ” there,
except a very small trade and a few
rather unsuccessful missionaries, and there
was no reason to believe that, in any case,
either of these would be interfered with.
Moreover, Britain herself has annexed about
one-seventh of the earth, and never a year
passes but she adds some few yards or few
hundred square miles to her bloated empire,
therefore her frenzy whenever some other
nation threatens to imitate her on a small
scale is a weird and ludicrous emotion. If
she had gone to war—as she seemed to be
within an ace of doing—on the present
occasion nobody outside the United King-
dom, and hardly anybody in it, would have
had a shadow of an idea as to the purpose in
view, save the one great fact that the
“ honor of the British flag ” had to be up-
held. Nevertheless, the hysterics of London
Standard and one or two other inflamed
publications might have led to Sydney and
Melbourne being laid in ashes and this
country being filled with murder and deso-
latiou. For the most notable advantage of
the British connection is that Britain has
many quarrels and many enemies, and Aus-
tralia, which has no quarrels and no enemies
of its own, inherits a share of them all.
* » #
Apparently, the scare has died away, for
the time, at all events, as suddenly and un-
accountably as it arose. Except for a certain
ill-feeling which may lead to further trouble
hereafter, nothing remains of last week’s
panic save sundry hair-raising newspaper
articles in which it was announced that
France would be despoiled of all her
colonies, and made to pay a vast indemnity,
and utterly trodden beneath the feet of her
antagonist. Also, there remain in print
various allusioils to that flag which is alleged
to have braved for a thousand years the
battle and the breeze, and various gaudy
boasts about the everlasting nature of the
empire, and how its many scattered frag-
ments will remain for ever united by a bond
of sympathy as one mighty nation. To the
outside observer, however, who is not drunk
with jingoism, the chances of that averted
war were sufficiently precarious. The general
European struggle which is always threaten-
ing will be fought under so many new con-
ditions, that no one who is not filled with a
deranged variety of patriotism can venture
to foretell the result. The iron monsters
which form the sea defences of the Great
Powers are as brittle as glass, and seemingly
almost as uncertain. So far, Britain has put
her trust mainly in her metal leviathans,
while France has exerted herself rather to
provide a host of swift torpedo boats, and,
up to date, the relative merits of these diverse
engines of destruction are mainly a matter of
conjecture. So are the relative merits of the
various magazine rifles, the various schemes
of mobilisation, and almost everything else
directly and indirectly involved. The next
great Avar will be for all parties a frantic
leap in the dark, and when the Standard
calls on Britain to go into the struggle with
a light heart, it is partly mad and wholly
criminal. No nation can afford to go to war
with a light heart in this last decade of the
nineteenth century.
* • •
It is interesting to sum up Britain’s
chances in the hideous gamble. The British
empire is, to all intents and purposes, a
thing of yesterday. Three centuries ago it
was represented solely by England, Wales,
and the more than half-lost kingdom of
Ireland, where one Owen Eoe O’Neil was
all but supreme. Six centuries of almost
chronic Avar had only resulted in the loss of
all the proA’inces Avhich the Norman and
Angevin kings had inherited on the Con-
tinent. Despite innumerable battles and
many victories, England was, in many
respects, the most consistently unlucky of
the great European states. But almost
from the date of the union with Scot-
land the tide turned, and in two cen-
turies or so of dazzling good fortune
the great empire was built up, though the
most valuable part of it Avas lost again in
the interim. The empire, and the flag
which is alleged to have braved the storms of
ten centuries, are both things of a very short
time ago. The British possessions have been
heaped together too fast to allow of any
genuine process of consolidation, and lioav
the great, straggling combination would
hang together under the pressure of any
serious disaster is wholly a matter of conjec-
ture. So far, the luck, save in the matter of
the American provinces, has been so consis-
tent that the loyalty of the disjointed league
has never been put to the test.
* • •
Never during this century has Britain
fought a great war single-handed. In the
Napoleonic campaigns she had more than
half Europe for allies. In the Crimea she
was merely part of a league of four States
against one. In the Indian Mutiny half the
native population was Avith her. There
is absolutely no evidence to go upon
in forming an estimate of Britain’s
capacity in a single-handed struggle with an
enemy of her own size, or anything
resembling her own size. Her army, in her
old fighting days, was about as large as that
of any other of the Great Powers ; now it is
by far the smallest of them all. Her reserve
system is almost absolutely untried. Under
the benign influences of Freetrade, the
British agricultural population, which for-
merly supplied all her best fighting material,
has almost faded away. The very best of
her regiments, in the Peninsular era, were
those raised in the Scotch Highlands, and
the genuine Highland population has
vanished almost en masse. Almost equally
good were her Irish regiments, and Free-
trade, absentee landlordism, and coercion
has reduced the Irish population almost 50
per cent. Even the bucolic population of
England has declined very heavily. In the
next protracted struggle the British army
must be recruited very largely from the
urban population, for Britain has become
mainly a land of bloated cities, and whether
this new element will be anything like the
old is a question which no one can answer in
advance.
* • •
The British navy, like every other navy,
is now entirely an unknown quantity.
Therefore, so far as the ships themselves are
concerned, she has probably as good a
chance as she fever had, and in past days her
success on the seas has been remarkable.
But the British sailor has gone, to a great
extent, the same way as the British agricul
turiat, and, both in the navy and the mer-
chant service, he has been largely replaced
by Scandinavians and other foreigners. To
them the British flag is a matter of no
special importance, and in the war of the
future they form another unknown quantity.
But though the British navy is the
largest in the world, it has not grown
in anything like due proportion to the
commerce it has to defend, or to
the enormous expanse of territory to
be protected. Moreover, Britain must fight
its next great war under a disadvantage
which is absolutely unique. In the days of
the Napoleonic struggle she was practically a
self-supporting country, but Freetrade has
long since changed all that. British agricul-
ture is now not much better than a dead
industry, and if it is possible, by an evil
chance, that her navy should be utterly
defeated and she should lose the command
of the seas, a very few weeks’blockade would
reduce her inhabitants to starvation. If
such an apparently improbable event should
happen—and nothing is absolutely impossible
in war—there would be no necessity for an
invasion ; the army and volunteer force and
the various reserves would never get a chance
to fire a shot, but would be left to be
eaten up by hunger on the unguarded
shores, and the whole structure of the British
empire—that gorgeous creation of yesterday
which vainly professes to have endured since
the days of the Heptarchy—would crumble
to pieces. Even if the experience of the
Napoleonic war were repeated, the result
would be sufficiently disastrous. In the
course of that conflict, despite her constant
successes at sea, Britain lost over 10,000
merchant vessels, large and small. The
consequences then were comparatively slight.
Now, under the fostering influences of Free-
trade, such success as that of Nelson’s days
would mean semi-starvation, while failure
would be synonymous with hopeless ruin.
* # *
Under all these new conditions it is not a
good thing for Britain to go to war with a
light heart and a placid assurance of victory.
In a single-handed contest with such a
power as France, she would have very much
to lose and very little to gain. She would
stake one-seventh of the world against a few
hopeless little colonies which her opponent
would be far better without. If she destroyed
her enemy’s navy she would be hardly any
nearer conquering France than when she
started, for more than two million bayonets
would still be in the way ; if her own was
destroyed she would be absolutely at the
mercy of her foe, and her army might as
well be non-existent. Such a war would be
a gamble against unheard-of odds, so that,
taking all the circumstances into account,
the present is not a favorable period for
jingoistic fervor. Australia, at all events,
which has to take a share of all Britain’s
dangers, and gets little in return save the
privilege of being a field for the investment
of British capital, has every cause to be glad
that the flag which did not brave the battle
and the breeze for a thousand years, or any-
thing even faintly resembling that period, is
likely to remain furled for a little while
longer.
Dead in the Bush.
The human tragedy has no grimmer scenes
than those daily acted in the vast theatre of
the Australian bush. Here the soul’s infinite
capacity for anguish is strained through
exquisite gradations of torture, till the bars
of the body are broken, and merciful Death
snaps the thread which binds the Ego to
existence. Pitilessly pursued by the °blind
forces of destructive Nature, isolated Man
staggers continually across the stage, racked
by hunger, consumed with thirst, crushed in
sickness, yet turning feebly to confront his
Furies, and fighting to the last against the
Inexorable which overwhelms him. Nowhere
appears the human figure more august, more
terrible than in this Promethean combat, when
an atom of dust stands at bay with the
Universe, and desperate Manhood, divine in
suffering, defies its destiny of annihilation.
* * *
In every nook of the Australian wilderness
bleach the bones of Australian pioneers. The
dingo and the crow, sole witnesses of their
death-struggles, tore the flesh from the shrunken
limbs. Sun and rain disintegrated the poor
remnants, and left the ruined framework of a
man to shock the unthinking traveller, or
gradually to be dissipated in the mysterious
chemistry of the elements. And the man lived
and suffered—to what end? Who profited by
his days and nights of final agony, when the
sun scorched him as it crawled slowly round the
heavens, and the dews bit into his ague-stricken
body while he lay and watched the callous
stars? Myths and creeds fall helpless before
the problem of such a pain perpetually repeated
through interminable variations of wretched-
ness ; and the teleology which seeks to explain
it must assume as permitting and responsible
ruler not a benevolent God, but a gloating and
remorseless Devil.
• • #
In hundreds of instances the man who is lost
in the Australian waste disappears silently for
ever. If a ripple of wonder be felt when he is
no longer seen in his accustomed haunts, it
rapidly subsides, and the rest is mere oblivion.
There are so many homeless wanderers tramp-
ing across the continent that the here-and-there
one who drops out of the ranks is never missed.
Maybe tears are shed in far-away lands ; but
the bush keeps its secrets well, and rarely lets
slip a clue to the identity of its victims. Yet
ever and anon some ghastly relics are unearthed,
some piteous tale appears in the newspapers,
and the weird personality of the wilderness
shows itself as a horrid Minotaur, guarding a
labyrinth which exacts year by year its tribute
of fated human lives.
Such relics were recently found near the
Clarke River m North Queensland, about
miles as the crow flies from Charters Towers
ami such a tale is printed in the N.Q. Registry
of August 18. Even in sad Australian records
nothing more pathetic has been published. Tim
story opens with the statement of three m» n
who riding near Wando Vale station, found 1
dead body. *

covered with the writing* and about eight inches

I do not know Station,

Dear Sir and Friend,—For you have been a real friend
tome. Ido not know if this statement will ever reach
you, but I write it on the chance. What induced me to
come into this part of the country Ido not know. The
only way that I can account for it is that at times I am
pot altogether compos mentis. However, I left Sydney
by steamer for Cairns, and then went by train to Mareeba
stopping a day at the Barron Falls (which 1 did not think
much of). I then footed it to Herberton, and as the main
road was not passible owing to the floods, I took the
mountains, keeping near the heads of the Eastern waters
for a time ; then crossing to the heads of the Western
waters. I met with terrible rough country, interspersed
with bogs, and if not wet with rain daily, I was wet with
very long grass. In fact, I had a fearful time of it but I
might have got through all right but for getting bushed
I left Oak Park, on the Copperfleld River, for
Park. The track was difficult to follow ; I lost it but
kept in the same direction, till I found myself at the’slip,
rails (open) of a paddock. As there was a creek running
E through it, I expected to find some place on the creelT
and followed it for two days, but it was awful rou.ffi’
and for better walking I left it. Then sickness came
on, caused probably by exposure, for no matter how tou<ffi
a man may be he cannot be wet through night and day
for more than a month without feeling the ill-effects of it.
I pushed south for a day, then went down a watercourse
that ran EWN and S at first, finally settling down to
nearly east. I got seven little sprats at the head of this
creek and followed it in the hopes of getting some more
but it is very shallow and I have not succeeded. When I
left Oak Park (Feb. 19), I had with me three days’ tucker.
I believe that I have had no food at all now for more than
a week, and have lost all energy for saving myself. I
have camped to wait for death, hoping that it will not be
long coming; it is not painful, only weakness, but it seems
hard to die of starvation. limy be found yet before I
die, but I do not think that it is likely.
Does God answer prayer?
If so, how about "Give us each day our daily bread ?’
With all blessings and good wishes, I remain, dear friend
yours respectfully, B. S. Robinson.
Then, after an interval, follows another letter.
With what anguish was that interval filled !
For Mr. ,
——— Station,
Paroo River, N.S. Wales.
Two days have passed and I am still alive. How' long
it will last I know not; perhaps assistance may yet come,
but Ido not think it will. There is a marked tree near
my camp. This country is so rough that no one should
venture off a main road, for it is just impossible to go
straight in any direction. May God in his mercy grant
that assistance may soon come, or that there may be a
speedy termination to a life of misery.
A few more days have passed. I have shifted my camp
a mile or two daily. lam so weak that 1 can only make
a few' steps at a time, then cast a hopeless glance around,
and stagger on a few' steps more.
Strange that I do not come across any snakes, goanna,
or anything eatable, nothing but wild arrowroot, and not
much of that, as I cannot climb for it.
I have tried to keep my promise not to attempt suicide
again, but am very much afraid that the temptation may
be too great for me to resist. I might try to bleed to
death. I have lost both my knives, but p übaps my
scissors may be able to do the trick. I am afraid my
straps are hardly strong enough to hang me. However,
here is another sunset with prospects of more rain ; let
the morning decide ; anyhow, my fate is in God s hands.
What a long time it takes ro die of starvation.
I have vet strength enough to crawl to the creek for
water. The moon is now past its first quarter, so I sup-
pose it is about March 14 to 15. lam lying d nvn all day
and night long, thinking of food; no pain, except that
my bed might be s >fter. How much longer life will last
Ido not know', but it would be a great satisfaction to,
do so.
The moon is now in its last quarter, I am too weak to.
fetch myself more water from the creek, but will try to,
crawl down there and, small as the quantity of water is,
try to drown myself.
God have mercy on me. The date is about Mar. 27/94,
Born, June 26/40. Aged 54.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Nation of Tenants.
The serious and eminently dull Westralian
Assembly was shaken up, the other day, by a
motion, introduced by Leake, M.L.A., to the
effect that no more State lands should be sold
on any of the W.A. goldfields. Leake’s
motion was based, to a great extent, on the
awful fact that 216,000 acres of the Coolgardie
district were recently jobbed away to an Eng-
lish syndicate at 2s. 6d. an acre with exemption
from all taxes for 12 years ! Considering the
possibilities of Coolgardie and the adjacent
country, it may easily be discovered, 30 or 40
years hence, that the State has thus sold, for
miserable £27,000, an income of half-a-
million or so per annum, and lias bur-
dened the country with an annual tribute
of that amount to a gang of rack-renting
English landlords. In view of this un-
speakably bad bargain, and many more almost
equally foolish and nefarious, Leake desired
that goldfields-land should only be leased in the
future, instead of being sold outright, and he
was promptly suppressed by 16 votes against
eight. That hard-faced Tory, Premier Forrest,
gave a death-blow to the proposition by point-
ing out that it was one of the ineradicable
instincts of “ every Englishman ” to possess
the freehold of his own home ; and his colleague,
Makmiox, having backed up his dreary foolery,


, announcing that every Irishman felt the
aiue way, tire matter was settled. How every
Australian felt wasn’t even mentioned. This
lleged desire of every man to possess his own
freehold, and the fact that the leasehold system
-ould run counter to thebeautiful instinct in ques-
tion, and would, therefore, cause the population to
somewhei'e else where freeholds were obtain-
able, is not by any means a new argument. It
bus done good service everywhere, whenever it
lias been proposed to establish the leasehold
system and preserve the unearned increment
to the State, and it has lasted so long
that it is about time someone rose up
and denounced it as a miserable lie and
a n imposture. For, in truth, the alleged “ in-
stinct ”is a fraud in every sense. Not one
Englishman in 100 owns his own dwelling, or
ever hopes to do so. The sale of land does not
create a class of small freeholders, each living
in his own habitation ; it may have been in-
tended to do so, but its ultimate result is to
make a number of big landlords and an appalling
army of rack-rented tenants. In the Australian
cities something like 90 per cent, of the popu-
lation are rent-payers, and in the agricultural
districts the proportion of tenants is steadily
increasing. If it has any kind of good luck,
t j, e Hampton Plains syndicate may some day
be the absentee landlord of 30,000 or 40,000
tenants, but neither it nor all the other British
speculators, who own among them three or
four million acres of W.A. laud, will ever help
one single individual to gratify his natural
British or other instinct by living on his own
freehold. The land-sale policy is rapidly turn-
ing Australia into a nation of hard-driven lease-
holders, and this country’s highways are being
trodden hard by the large, flat feet of the agent
as he comes round every Monday morning to
collect the rent. The only definite result that
lias been achieved is that he collects the rent
for a private owner instead of for the Treasury,
and that doesn’t seem very much for any com-
munity to boast about.
Minimum Wage in Protected Industries.
The assembly of master bootmakers, in Melb.
last week, affords a crop of texts. The pro-
tected manufacturers who become haughty and
overbearing with success appear to forget that
their establishments are not purely private con-
cerns. To a certain definite extent the
State has a lien on the industries which
it establishes, even though its share in
floating the concern is but the Hey,
Presto !of a protective tax. Protection lays
obligations on the protected. The State guar-
antees its patronage, but not because it wants
to have a sweating system on the European
plan. Protection implies a local autonomy un-
hampered and undisgraced by pauper labor.
But do we find that the men advantaged by
Protection honestly endeavor to justify the pro-
tection ? Two speeches (Age report) by master
bootmakers in Melbourne :
Mr. Yager said he could see so many agreements had
been made that only division could result, and the manu-
facturers would only be playing halls and skittles with one
another. It was his intention to vo home and pay what-
ever he chose, without reference either to the employers’
or the men’s union.
Mr. J. BedgoOod stated he agreed with Mr. Yager’s re-
marks. As to his own firm, the members had made up
their minds that when work was resumed, if other makers
generally paid less than the 1892 statement, his firm
would at once tackle its wages-sheet and see ttiat it got
its work done at the same rates as others were paying.
Here are two men, established in business by
the vote of the people, bragging of their in-
dependence, and threatening to wreak the mis-
deeds of their brother ingrates on the por-
tion of the people unfortunately under their
control. The lesson is clear and plain. If
Protection does not protect the State from the
monopolist within as well as from the mono-
polist without, then the time has come for an
era of Free Heath. The chain of Protection is
complete In all but one link. That link is the
minimum wage. The day of the minimum
wage in Government and municipal contracts
is almost here. The next step is the minimum
wage for protected industries. With the boot-
trade in Victoria at the present moment the mini-
mum wage would be the solvent of the difficulty,
or, rather, the difficulty would never have arisen.
The master-bootmakers of Melbourne are,
fortunately, not all Yagers and Bedggoods
The very disunion existing in the employers’
ranks shows that there is a strong tendency to
concede the demands of the strikers. Not that
absolute justice necessarily rests with one side
in every dispute. The constant tendency to
trade disputes in “good times” as well as
“ bad times ” is exaggerated by the absence of a
standard to which arguments may be referred.
The minimum wage of an independent and
capable tribunal is that standard. It is
peculiarly and palpably appropriate to State-
protected industries. It would protect the
workers from the “ minimum of existence ”
below which men die, and it would assist
honest employers striving to build up a legiti-
mate trade.
Parliamentary Disintegration.
Payment of members, according to the Aus-
tralian Star, is fast demoralising the New
South Wales Assembly. Where there used to
be only two parties there are now a dozen or
more, and this, in the Star’s ppinion, is con-
clusive evidence of deterioration :
The House contains more parties and cliques than any
We remelu ber. There are Freetraders, Revenue-
tanfflsls, Protectionists, the Solidarity Party, the unat-
tached representatives of Labor, and the Country Party.
A'id amongst the Freetraders there are several cliques,
there are followers of Mr. Reid, followers of Sir Henry
iarkes, and followers of Mr. Wise. The first-named
advocate land and income taxation ; the last two are prac-
tically single-taxers, whilst the Parkesites are of the
opinion that no substantial alterations should he made in
the tariff, and the one thing Parliament ought to do is to
promote Federation. Can anybody name an Assembly
that contained so many parties?
Ihe Bulletin admits all the above, and is
gratified thereat. The present N.S.W. As-
sembly contains a dozen parties or more, and
this paper hopes to see the good work go on till
it contains three dozen at least. The House is
supposed to be a reflex of the people ; among
the thinking portion there are hardly two men
who hold exactly the same opinions upon all
matters ; therefore the Assembly should con-
tain almost as many parties as it does
members. If it doesn’t, then either the
people have given up thinking, or the
members are corrupt, or something else is serf
ously wrong. The trouble is that the supremely
idiotic system of Government by Party is based
on the equally idiotic assumption that the
Legislature and the nation should always be
divided into exactly two factions, and the
members of each faction should think absolutely
alike on every point. Which is just as foolish
as to suppose that there should only be two
sizes of boots in the community, and that the
man who doesn’t wear No. 6 shall necessarily
be exactly fitted with No. 10. If Ministers,
instead of being appointed in the present ram-
shackle fashion, were chosen for a fixed term
by vote of the people’s representatives, and
were not required to have the confidence of
any party, and their measures could be
thrown out or altered in any way without
the Ministry being thereby ejected from office,
and members could follow their own convictions
instead of being bull-dozed with the threat that,
if they don’t vote on strict party lines, their
own crowd will go out, or will fail to come in, and
all the rest of their policy will be sacrificed,
then it wouldn’t matter how many parties there
were in the Assembly. The paper which com-
plains that the multiplication of parties must
stop so that Government by Contradiction may
go on has got things upside-down. It is
Government by Contradiction that has to stop.
As to the other thing, the country wants as
many parties as it can honestly get.
The general ruck of Sydney barristers is
timidly moving towards the emancipation of
Briefless Lxttlewig, Esq., from the thraldom
of Horseleech Pettifogger, gent. one. As
yet, the Sydney barristers haven’t the col-
lective spunk to demand candidly that they
should be permitted to see clients personally
and without the intervention of a solicitor,
“ Because why ?” Because they want to “ get
all and give none.” Their present feeble
expression of opinion involves the absolute
amalgamation, on terms of equality, of all the
branches of the legal profession, and even
Briefless Littlewig, in his pigmy dignity,
could hardly stand Pettifogger’s right to
argue before the Full Court alongside of his
own mediocrity. Any average Attorney-
General, as one of the Devil’s Guild, naturally
weighs the prospect in prejudiced scales.
What is wanted is an Attorney-General imbued
with a deep scorn of his own profession, and
fired with a desire to serve the lay public
oidy, and send, if necessary, the whole legal
fraternity to its father, the Devil. The public
would probably hail, as a first instalment of
legal reform, the amalgamation of the branches
of the law-violating profession; but what it
hankers after is the abolition of the whole
“ biling ”of sharks as a protected guild. The
law, if passed, can be made inoperative by the
damnable inertia of legal etiquette. As ex-
ample : Queensland has its legal-practitioners’
law, whereby a barrister may act as a solicitor,
&c., by brass-plating himself as a “legal practi-
tioner,” and under this law the late solicitor
Mein was made a puisne Judge by his crony,
Sam Griffith, then Premier and now C. J. But
“legal practitioners” in Queensland—or, at
least, in Brisbane—are relentlessly “sent to
Coventry ” by the “ profession ” generally.
They are caste Ishmaels, their hands being
equally against other barristers and solicitors.
In the meantime, what Sydney wants is a
brainy, honest, “respectable” barrister who
will partner with a solicitor and give cheap
legal advice to all-comers on lines parallel to
those now remuneratively worked in the medi-
cal profession, some members of which give
“advice and medicine ” to callers at 2s. 6d. per
call. There’s a big pile in this idea.
A stereotyped reason for refusing Australian
wine-selling licences in New South Wales is
that supposed to be inherent in the formula —
“ Not required.” Assuming that our civilisa-
tion is sane and able to support its acts with
argument, where does the logic here appear ?
Is any applicant for a milk-vendor’s licence ever
refused on the utterly gratuitous assertion that
he or she, in his or her desired capacity, is
“not required?” Is any intending hawker
ever refused his licence solely on such an absurd
.pretence? Then, if not, why is this foolery
perpetrated in connection with Australian-wine
licences ? Is it to be laid down as a theorem
that a province, or a district, or a town is only
permitted to sustain the particular number of
Australian wine-sellers that some utterly irre-
sponsibleand meagrely-informed official declares
to be “required?” If so, who is going to
demonstrate the theorem? Who shall be
authorised to gauge and declare the cubic
contents of the local wine-drinking stomach ?
Who shall be clothed .with the power of either
setting bounds to the local vinous thirst, or of
conferring a monopoly upon a limited number
of licensed vendors ? On the one hand, the
State professes to nurture the great Australian
wine-producing industry, and certainly takes a
parentally corrective control of the operations
of viticulturists, besides appointing Boards to
deal penally with them under certain circum-
stances. On the other hand, any Bumble of
“ brief authority ” may impede the progress of
the industry by assuring the beak, who dis-
penses licences as if by inspiration, that this
or that wine-license is “not required”—thus
refusing revenue as well as hurting the in-
dustry. No one knows whether any license
is “not required.” Any statement to that
effect is merely a spurt of official presumption.
Grant the license in any and every case, so
long as the applicant is a respectable citizen,
and officialism cannot go far wrong. If it is
“ not required,” the licensee will speedily dis-
cover the fact and won’t bother the authorities
for a renewal.
There is a chorus of Parliamentary hairsplitters
who say that their .£3OO is not wages or salary,
but merely reimbursement of expenses. This
was Garrett’s introduction to the New South
Wales Bill in its early days, and the reimburse-
ment phrase was concocted to soothe Parkes,
who was a deadly foe to payment of members.
But no one then treated the expression as other
than a phrase, and its repetition in apparent
gravity by a number of men in the present
House proves how well-assured they are that
the world is gullible. Is not the payment
the average member receives his means of
living ? Does he not give his work in exchange ?
How would the reimbursement phrase apply to
a coal-lumper when he pockets his wages?
How does it fit a tailor who makes a suit of
clothes? There are wages for services, and that
is the principle the country had in mind when
it directed or sanctioned payment of members,
The man who contends that members should
receive no monetary consideration for Parlia-
mentary service is wrong-headed, but is not
contemptible; but the man who pockets .£6
a week for his Parliamentary work, but will
have it that this is not payment but merely
reimbursement, is either a tricky word-juggler
or a democratic fraud.

Sydney printers are on strike. The masters
wmh to reduce tm.e-wages from £3 to 12s.
for 48 hours; the men offer to take £2 l6s , ;
the masters refuse ; the men go out; and—the
vacant frames are filled immediately by the
multitude of comps, chronically unemployed.
It is the same sad, old story. Yet maybe the
ms are right to sacrifice themselves in struggle,
For, once set, precedent is inexorable ; and
wages once docked without resistance, ic rs
opportunity would be seized to dock them
again. The masters say that times are so hard
and competition is so keen that they cannot
get a fair profit on their work and pay the o
rate. But will the reduction help them . No
one whit; the public will get the full benefit ofiL
Nothing but competition has brought punteis
profits down to the bare subsistence-margin a
which they now stand ; and competition will
reduce them further till the same margin is
touched lower down the scale. The job quoted
at il now may be quoted at 19s. when wages
are lowered, but the Is taken from the com-
positor will go, not to the master, but to the
customer. This follows inevitably from the
present condition of things. And, as existing
charges are by no means unusually high, things
might very well have been left as they were,
But this is a time of retrenchment; and the
itch is attacking all employers in turn. All the
worse, in the long run, for the employers. Three
or four firms, to their credit be it said, accept
the men’s compromise. It remains to be seen
whether the public is unselfish enough to stand
by them.

“I am a staunch Freetrader. I hate the thing called
Protection, because it is mere blackmailing (loud cheers)
—it makes men put their hands into their pockets to
support other people's business.”—(Gibber by Canos
Potter at the Church of England Assembly, Melbourne.)
Bishop Camidge, of Bathurst (N.S.W.), is now
busy explaining his alleged utterances during
his recent trip to England. According to Dr.
Camidge he didn’t say what he was accused of
saying at all, and all the strictures passed upon
him were wholly unmerited. “ What I did
say,” he states, “was that if money were at
the present time judiciously invested in real
estate in Sydney, I believed in a few years, if
things went on improving as we expected, that
real estate would be worth four or five times as
much.” This was what shepherd Camidge,
according to his own showing, said to his
Yorkshire audience, and it is so exactly
the same thing as he was previously
accused of saying that his explanation
doesn’t seem to make any difference. Pastor
Camidge gets his tea and damper and
his episcopal gaiters out of this country, also
his mansion and the rest of the things necessary
to the perishing tabernacle of the flesh. And
in return he went “Home” and told his
audiences, m an indirect fashion, perhaps, but
with sufficient clearness, that Australia was in
a dreadfully bad way just now, and that
if any English capitalist there present
cared to take a mean advantage of our
necessities he could buy up property
in Sydney very much below its value. Then in
a few years the Australian would be glad to
buy it back again for four or five times the
price it was sold at, so that the foreign capi-
talist who put a million in the country would
take five millions out, and thus plunder Aus-
tralia of four millions for which he gave no
value whatever. In fact, Bishop Camidge,
on his own showing, was practically en-
couraging his British audience to loot, by a
morally - dishonest process, the country of
his adoption, because it happens to be in a
weak state and can’t defend itself. And this
isn’t by any means what Australia expects
from its Bishop, who is supposed to be a
heavenly-minded creature, and not a bagman
travelling in the interests of the British in-
vestor.
He has arisen in all his majesty of strength and

the contemptible Anonymus who is bold in
solution of nut-galls, and who poniards behind
her back the soured mother of the girl to whom
he has promised a house-keeper’s billet for life
with board and lodging and drunken boots as
wages. But the fearless crusader who has
dared the shock in the open, and, before a
thrilled and awestruck world, has pumphandled
the mighty engine of the Statute Law and has
said unto his saddle-straddling mother-in-law—
“ Clear out of my house, or pay me that 10
weeks’ board and lodging you’ve had ! ” Alas !
that this welkin-rending challenge to Crea-
tion should waterspout only to the ebulli-
tion of effervescence ! The Statute Law, weak
and irresolute before the frowning personality
of the Gorgon, seeing in a vision the cold
goggle-eyes of its own hearthstone Fury, chewed
its swan-quill and postponed the matter to a
more convenient season. But the noisy fame
of the heroic son-in-law shall endure as a
mummy. Not Hampden, not Washington,
not Tell, not even Tommy Dodd and Samuel
Albert Rosa, were a combined rag-patch on
the Sydney son-in-law who worried his wife’s

dignity. The hero of all heroes he I—whose1 —whose
name, by the way, The Bulletin has forgotten.
Sic transit gloria Grundy !
Parson Henderson, of Melbourne, a newly-
imported sky-pilot from Dundee, preached
recently on the iniquity of Protection, its con-
spicuous sinfulness being that it is an utterly
selfish device, the purpose of which is to
“ boost” the community which adopts it without
caring what becomes of the rest of the world.
It is truly awful to think that Australia should
have gone to the expense of importing such a
simple-minded and unfinished person as Hen-
derson from the other end of the earth, when
an equally foolish individual could have been
found so much nearer. Of course, Protection is
selfish—utterly, beastly, disgustingly selfish.
So is Freetrade. The constant argument
advanced in favour of Freetrade is that it will
help “ our ” little community, and the rest of
the world may take care of itself. No one has
ever ventured to advocate either Freetrade or
Protection, or any other policy, on the sole
ground that it will do a lot of good to other
nations and leave our own just as it was, or
perhaps a little worse. Also, no one has
ever dared to advocate any ,creed with the
cordial assurance that it will save somebody
else’s soul and leave our own as badly off as
ever; every true pietist is engaged in a selfish
rush to save his own soul, and the other
fellow’s soul is a secondary consideration.
Also, no preacher has ever attempted to fill any
other preacher’s church instead of his own ; and
no country hasever maintained an army andnavy
for the express purpose of protecting some
other country and letting itself slide ; and no-
body on record has ever done anything that
wasn’t selfish—the man who does what the
world calls an unselfish action generally does it
for the selfish pleasure of feeling that he has
done it. Of course. Protection is selfish—
unutterably and brutally selfish. What else
did the unspeakable Henderson expect that it
or any other thing would be ?
Mrs. Annie Besant, when she brings forward
her proofs as to the truth of Spiritualism,
makes the usual mistake of relying on so-called
“miracles” as evidence. One of her state-
ments concerns a medium who, in the presence
of reliable witnesses, is slowly elevated by
some invisible force to the ceiling of a large
room, where, lying on nothing, he writes
messages on the plaster. Many people who
see this are doubtless converted on the
spot. The deceased Blavatsky is said
to have proved the truth of Theosophy
in a somewhat similar fashion. At an
impromptu picnic the party happened to
be a cup and saucer short, whereupon the
miracle-worker directed someone to dig beside
the roots of an adjacent tree, and there a cup
and saucer were found which exactly matched
the rest of the set. There things are remark-
able enough, no doubt, but they are just as use-
ful to prove the truth of Mormonism as to prove
anything else. If the balloon had been in-
vented and perfected by one man, who alone
knew the secret of aerial navigation, he
could have demonstrated just as logically
the errors of infantile baptism by going up
in his machine in the presence of a large
and moderately stupid assemblage. All that
was necessary would have been to tell his
audience with sufficient impressiveness that
adult baptism was the only correct thing, and
that he had a direct revelation to that effect,
and then go up in his big air-ship, whereupon a
very large section of his audience would have
regarded the matter as definitely settled. The
original discoverer of gunpowder might have
proved almost anything he liked by exploding a
cwt. of the new compound with a little pre-
liminary ceremony. No creed can be demon-
strated by a man floating in the air, any more
than it can by a man walking on a tight-rope
or boiling an egg in a hat without injury to the
hat.
Cheap Laborers in the vineyard.
We learn with sorrow, not surprise,
That preachers of Religion’s beauties,
Instead of pointing to the skies
And teaching sinners how to rise,

The State protects the working man
And glories in his foes’ disaster ;
The shepherd doeth all he can,
By working on an Argus plan.
To serve his (stovepipe-hatted) Master.

And beam upon their hired snorter ;
He owes to them the bread he eats,
The vegetables, beef and sweets,
For them alone his bosom beats—
Good servant of the fat importer !
The more the “ screw ” the shepherd draws
The more he serves the broad-cloth coat-er,
The more he cackles Cobden’s saws
And swears by Hingland’s tariff laws,
And vilifies the common voter.
A Christian loves his neighbor dear;
And, living in a tony quarter—
No nasty, humble dwellings near—
The parson’s neighbor (which is clear)
Sings ever in his holy ear
The sorrows of a fat importer.
We learn with sorrow, once again,
That saints who walk in golden fetters ~
And have a sordid point to gain
Are getting “ calls ” from Flinders-laue
To preach the gospel of the sweaters.
Their little minds distil delight
From arguments as weak as water.
God’s right is wrong and wrong is right
In these professing Christians’ sight,
So liars lead them on to fight
The battle of the fat importer.
The Census of N.S. Wales.
The Census of New South Wales (1891) issued by
Mr. T. A. Coghlan, Govt. Statistician, is an
interesting volume of 330 pages, which contains
more information than can be assimilated at short
notice. It is especially interesting in the early
chapters, where it deals with the primitive methods
adopted to round up and yard the population in
the Early Days; and in the concluding pages
where the writer deals with “Incidents of the
Census.” A lot of these incidents are remarkable
in their way. Some of them relate to the
Christian names of various unhappy inhabitants,
about the most astonishing of which is probably
“ Port Jackson.” A man named Fort Jackson

370 GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY.
(General Poet Office next.)
Starts life with a heavy handicap, and the only
visible remedy for bis disease is to call himself
Peter Jackson. Other features of Mr. Coghlan’s
tale concern the samples of wild native humor
which turn up in the census papers. One woman,
for instance, returned her occupation as “ takes
washing,” and that of her son as “takes fits”—
one of the most sorrowful varieties of mirth which
could well be imagined. A person found sleeping
in a hollow tree put himself down as a “grazier”
on the ground that he lived on grass. A number
of citizens used bad language about their mothers-
in-law in their schedules, and others made un-
pleasant observations concerning their wives, one
of the latter being described as “ healthy, but bad-
tempered.” The occupations included such un-
obtrusively frank definitions as “ concubine ” and
“eunuch,” and others that were still more frank
and wholly unpublishable.
• * *
The religious statistics contained in the volume
are very elaborate, and show that there are no
less than 191 different creeds among the small
population of New South Wales, includ-
ing such weird stragglers as Non-Intrusion-
ists, Pessimists, Fatalists, Christian Saints,
“Gathered Unto Me,” and “Ecclesiastes VI.”
When one considers that all these sects, right down
to the “ Gathered unto Me,” is more or less firmly
convinced that all the rest of the community is
lost, this list becomes a very solemn thing to
reflect upon. A really surprising feature, and one
that upsets a lot of preconceived ideas, is that the
cranky, half-boiled little sects consist mostly of
men. Among the big and profoundly orthodox
creeds the men predominate just sufficiently—
considering that there are six men to five women
in the province—to show that the sexes are about
equally pious, but in the list of the small and
crazy churches males are three times as numerous
as females. Twenty-five dreadfully erratic con-
gregations count not one woman among their
adh-rents. The particularly violent unbelievers
are also mostly male, from which it would appear
that the he-cornstalk is more aggressive both in
his religion and in his want of a religion than the
she of the same race.
• • •
The “ Sickness and Infirmity of the People ” is
a gh istly chapter which any person of weak diges-
tion had better skip. One of its features is that
there are only two insane journalists in N.S.W.
an 1 only one tragedian in the Benevolent Asylum.
In the chapter dealing with “Habitations,” it tran-
•U'ires that about 4 per cent, of the population
dwe Is in tents, and 60 per cent, in houses where
the total accommodation is about three-quarters
<>f a room to each inhabitant. From this it would
appear that N.S.W., with million of people
and 198,000,000 acres, is already becoming some-
what overcrowded and short of sleeping space.
And just here it is worth noting that, in Mr.
Coghlan’s opinion, “they are generally the best
workers, and those whose standard of living is
highest, who are most involved in strikes and
combinations to maintain wages or increase them.”
Which is another way of saying that the worst
workers, and those whose style of living is most
like that of a hog in a sty, are the non-unionist
class. The section dealing with “Occupations,”
giving, as it does, the statistics up to the
end of the “Freetrade” epoch, shows some
rather awkward facts for those who have
t»een accustomed to claim that the manufacturing
industries of N.S.W. had gone far ahead of those
of Victoria, “artificially-fostered” by Protection.
The comparison of the number of factories and
the employes therein proves nothing, because a
factory, as defined by Victorian law, and the same
thing as defined by N.S.W. statute, are entirely
different. Taking the two census returns, how-
ever, Victoria, with a smaller population, has
about 14,000 more people employed in manufac-
tures than N.S. Wales.
• • •
These are a few scattered facts picked up at
random from the vast mass of information which
Mr. Coghlan has compiled. His volume is well-
printed, his facts are set forth in intelligible
langu ige, and almost every subject is illustrated
by diagrams which make the matter in question
as clear as anything dealing with statistics well
cm be. There are many things in it to
make the Australian feel proud, and many
more to make him feel miserably sick at
the stomach, and very much ashamed of
the great country to which he belongs. Also,
many of the figures—the lists of tent-dwellers, of
homeless persons who were enumerated in hollow-
trees and similar refuges, the unemployed citizens,
illiterates, persons dwelling in one-roomed habi-
tations, epileptics, cranks, persons who complain
pathetically in their schedules about their mothers-
in-law and their wives and their grandmothers
and about the drinking habits of the old man,
persons who put themselves down as “Ecclesiastes
Vi.” and the like —are solemn reading, and calcu-
lated to make any intelligent student feel that
this world is a fool of a place at the best. A
census-return, when it is read carefully, and
thoroughly digested, is an epitome of a country’s
misery, poverty, deformity, pauperism and general
ugliness, and is about the saddest thing outside
Gehenna.
If there is any truth in the yarn that 2000
Russian convicts have escaped from Siberia into

there are lively times in prospect for somebody,

Now that the N.S. W. per cent, loan has gone
off with a rush at 99| it is pleasant to reflect that only a
year afro the same province borrowed £2,500,000 for 40
years at 4 per cent, and floated the loan at 97J nett I
During the 40 years of the loan’s currency that difference
of a miserable J per cent, will mean just £500,000 in gold
taken out of the country. And it is also interestirifr to
remember that a loan of two-and-a-half millions for 40
years at 4 per cent, will cost just four millions in interest
by the end of that period, and the original debt of two-
and-a-half millions will be still owing, and will be as
robust and as capable of earning another four millions in
interest as it ever was.

N.S. Wales 4 per cent, debentures were sold in
Sydney, last week, at £lO5 10s. After that the possibility
of selling 3J per cent, stock in Sydney at par is almost
beyond question. The price of N.S.W. stock in London
is now only 20s. higher than the local quotation, and the
various commissions levied by the British financial shark,
and the cost of remitting interest to England, would
probably make Sydney the cheaper market of the two.

The Colonial Bank of N.Z. pays its invariable
7 per cent. div. and has about £2500 to carry forward.
The Colonial has a paid-up capital of £400,000 and a
reserve of £55,000, and is one of the few Australasian
banks which has never gone broke, or reconstructed, or
suspended, or written off its reserve to meet losses, or
otherwise been in trouble. Which is about all that can
be said for any bank until a system of strict State-audit is
established. That good old item “Advances and all other
Debts due to the Bank ” covers such a multitude of sins
that no one can say anything really definite about any
bank save the bank that is already gone broke. There-
fore, it doesn’t follow that the Colonial of N.Z. is sound ;
it only follows that no one, up to date, suspects it of being
unsound.

Editor Bulletin,—“ Spud ” complains in re
“ Xenos’” estimate of £1 10s. per ton for potatoes for
starch-making, that the price is too low, £2 15s. being the
average price in Sydney for last five years. Can “ Spud ”
say how many hundreds or thousands of tons of potatoes
have been thrown into Port Jackson during that time as
unsaleable ? Does he know that in the Crookwell district
(N.S.W.) hundreds of tons have been left to rot in the
pits, because they would not fetch enough to pay carriage
to Sydney? Potatoes are now selling there at 1/5 per
cwt. My idea was that the starch should be made as near
as possible to the place where the potatoes are grown
that the growers should co-operate to put up a central
starch-mill, just as butter-factories are put up, and should
send their surplus potatoes there to he treated. It would
prevent gluts in the market, and substitute a cheap, good
native product for a dear and sometimes rubbishy
imported one.—J.R.

In Victoria the mint-deficit is decreasing year
by year, and this means that the large production of gold
enables the whole cost of coinage to be supported by the
miner. But the Westralian mint will find a different
state of affairs in the beginning, and the Government
reckons on a cost of £lO,OOO a year to the State till the
present production is very much larger. It would appear,
however, that this estimate is rather bigger than might be
reasonably calculated. It will be a good day for the
Coolgardie and Murchison miner when the mint (or the
assay office previously proposed in this column) is estab-
lished in Perth. At present, he is losing 3/- to 15/- per
oz. by reason of the distance of the market (mint) and the
“ nearness ” of the middleman.

A certain bank had a customer heavily over-
drawn, and, as he was unable to offer any security, re-
quested him to form his business into a limited co. This
was done, and his creditors, being his relatives, took paid-
up shares for the amount of their claims, while the mer-
chant was allotted contributing shares, which he handed
to the bank as security. The directorate was actually the
merchant, and a heavy call was promptly made, which
the bank had to advance in order to keep its security
alive. Which shows how' the bank improved (?) its
security by transferring its claim from a man’s private
and trading estate to-his private estate only, supple-
mented by a portion only of his trading venture, fixed
and unnegotiable. Doubtless this appears on the balance-
sheet with-accrued interest as a good asset.

An attorney who sheds cheques like leaves in
autumn, was badly left the other day. A holder of one
of his leaves got information when the settlement of a
case, which the solicitor had won, on behalf of a client,
would take place, and watching the payment of the
settlement cheque into the solicitor’s account, paid in his
own, which was promptly met. The client was duly paid
by cheque, and went to the bank, but “ when he got there
the cupboard was bare,” and he now theatens to bring
the gent, one before the Law Institute.
The same solicitor, when a client jibbed at a
stiff bill of costs, and elected to have it taxed, went to the
counsel in the case, paid his fees by cheque, took the
horsehair man’s receipt, to enable him to exhibit same to
taxing-master, and get the item passed—and then coolly
went to the bank, and stopped payment of the cheque 1

Our friend Moses Discountesheim adroitly
wriggled out of a prospective heavy loss, the other day.
He had melted for a client a bill bearing the forged signa-
ture of a well-known firm of sharebrokers. The operator
had been discounting these forged bills for some time
with the kindly Moses, but had taken care never to have
more than one under discount at a time. When the
lender discovered the forgery he waited, correctly calcu-
lating that a fresh bill would be brought as usual for dis-
count, and the current one taken up with the proceeds.
In due course this happened, and when the new bill was
brought Moses promised to discount it, but excused him-
self for that day as the bill he held was in his safe at
home, and he would bring it in on the morrow, ma tear
freutid.
On the morrow Mr. Moses did not appear,
having been called unexpectedly away, but his clerk had
the cheque drawn out and signed, apparently reaily to
discount the latest bill. The discounter appeared and
was informed that Mr. Moses had left the cheque for the
last hill submitted, and it was to be handed over on the
original bill being taken up. This was a dilemma, as the
clerk would persist in carrying out the strict letter of his
instructions, viz., “that the bill under discount must he
taken up before the cheque could be handed over for the
last; ” and the cheque was flourished to emphasize this.
After wasting considerable persuasive eloquence
on the clerk, the operator withdrew, and presently re-
turned with another 60-percenter, who doubtless intended
to make a trifle, by lending the amount to take up the
current bill lor a few minutes. The needful was now
produced and the bill taken up, and the cheque, pro-
ceeds of the last forgery, waited for. The clerk unlocked
his cash-drawer, and drawing out, not the cheque, but
the bill, handed it to the expectant individual with the
remark, “ It was decided to decline the fresh business for
reasons best known to the introducer.” How the other
financier fared, history sayeth not, but this was emphati-
cally not one of “ Moses’ mistakes.”

Hence the absence of fires, and the overflowing coffers of

to Victoria, and as they will all have to take extra risks to

Editor Bulletin, —There is a vacancy just now
for an M.P. game to get up and ask for a sworn return
from the banks, constructed and re-constructed, as to
their unclaimed balances. The trifling balances at credit
of deceased and other sorts of customers amount in
every bank to tens of thousands sterling. Why shouldn’t
those forgotten balances revert to the State every seventh
year? A short Act vesting all,unclaimed balances in the
Curator of Intestate Estates for the behoof of the State
is wanted worse than a lot of other things the public
howls for. As an old bank-clerk I know of several thou-
sands in one country branch bank belonging to people
who are still alive 1 Under the reconstruction and
liquidation schemes all such sums are most likely engulfed
according to law. Therefore, a vacancy exists for some
person to get up and move and “ keep on moving ” for a
return or a bill or some legal thumbscrew to make bankers
own up how much of other people’s money they are
keeping back from its owners or the State. It sometimes
happens people do ask about old balances, and then old
ledgers are hiked out of old voucher-rooms to be in-
spected, only to result in the discovery that during the
course of copying the list of unclaimed balances from a
filled ledger to a new one, as happens periodically, the
name “ Robinson ” has been transmuted into “Robert-
son,” or the ancient cognomen “Smyth ” into “ Smith.”
I’ve done it myself, so I know’.—Yours, Thin Man.

possibly jump the Colo water-power when the Austra-

openly for a water-lease their game would be known and
their attempt frustrated. They think they will get the
lease by a clause in their bill asking Parliament to
transfer the lease, already granted, to them, as those to
whom it was issued are not taking steps to have it fully
secured by passing a bill. Their contention is that as the
lease is issued, no matter to whom, another lease cannot
be granted, and that Parliament only can transfer that
lease on being satisfied of the bona fide» of the lessees.—

obstructed were found to be hollowed out by nature
forming almost regular troughs. The hole was then filled
up with mullock, in order (says Dunn) to place the mine
in safety from being rushed, although a policeman had
been doing sentry duty since the find was reported.
However, a sh ft, 6ft. by 3ft., has been commenced on the

The point in the Londonderry North jumping-
case is simply this: Can a lease be forfeited before it is

cancelled on the ground of non-fulfilment of the labour
conditions of a lease ? Still plainer, does the application
for a lease carry with it the necessity to comply with
labour conditions? W. A. mining regulations say “yes" to
all these questions ; but the Act on which the regulations
are based is not clear, and the thing is —Do the regula-
tions go beyond the scope of the Act? W.A. Supreme
Court has been wrestling with the problem—the knottiest
ever submitted to it. The Londonderry extended claims
are at stake and, in the present condition of the market,

Warden Finnerty recently ruled that Sunday
pegging of leases was legal, and granted an application
for ground alleged to have been pegged on Sunday. He
had, however, the good sense to state a case for the
opinion of the Attorney-General. If a man can be
punished under common-law for pursuing his usual avoca-
tion on Sunday, how on earth can the Sunday pegging
of a mine by a miner be legal ?

The big shareholder in Mt. Drysdale, who
skipped out on the advice of two geological experts—one
from Queensland, the other from Victoria, lost upwards
of £20,000 by their advice. Geologists are the most un-
fortunate of all mining-men—they seldom make any
money for themselves in mines and frequently lose it for
other people. To pay fat fees and lose a big fortune is a
grim geological joke.

to the fore again with a very rational appeal for

Two more missionaries are off from Sydney
to straighten up the Mulgrave River (N.Q.) blacks.
“The Bellenden-Kor mission ” is a standing joke
with white set tlers on the spot, the local aboriginal
fining worth about as much for “conversion”
purposes as a tree-climbing kangaroo. But the
mission does give food and shelter to a few
wretched natives, and they get so little charity up
North that it would be a pity if the play were
stopped.
Mr. Bert Levy’s sketch in this issue,
‘Two Sydney larrikins up to date,” shows the
Sydney tough in his newest form of development.
The very latest larrikin wears pearl buttons, after
the London coster fashion; and glaring, red
parrokeet boots, all silk and embroidery, and deco-
rated with rows of silver bells, which jangle
as he walks. He has his own photo, on the
toe of one boot and his donah’s on the other, and
one boot bears the inscription “May loves Billy,”
while the other is decorated with the legend
“ Billy loves May.” He pays i>3 or more for these
gorgeous decorations, and when he has got them
on he goes out and swears with a light heart.
Altogether, the Sydney larrikin is keeping pace
with the times.
Oliver Wendell Holmes is dead at 85-
dear old Oliver! His talent did not amount to
genius; but he made such a bright and cheery
noise in the world of letters that every book-
reader loved him. His life was singularly full,
complete, and successful ; and it closes as natur-
ally as a perfect day. Of his books, the Break-
fast-table and Tea-cup essays are best. All are
piquant; all charm by their grace of style and
unaffected fragrance of thought; all have a basis
of luminous intellect which is very pleasant to
rest upon. But the Autocrat is freshest and
strongest—Professor, Poet, and Tea-Cups are
sometimes repetitious, occasionally dull. The
Autocrat could not be the one, and would
disdain to be the other. Perhaps the similes
and illustrations —there are beautiful examples
of each class give Holmes’ books their
dainty and distinctive flavor. One can sip
and sip, and the palate never cloys. But
the witching draught must not be drunk to the
dregs. Holmes is generally in high spirits, and
one should come to him in high spirits. Yet he
can touch the minor chords —how tenderly the
Autocrat’s love-episode is treated ! And so he is
dead at 85.
Dean Macartney, of Melbourne, died las* 5
Monday, when well on in his 96th year. He was
born in 1799, so he narrowly missed having a
glimpse of three centuries ; and had been a clergy-
man of the Anglican Church for 72 years. His
clerical career commenced in ’22, when he became
curate of Banagher, and he came to Australia
in ’47, with Dr. Perry, first Bishop of Mel-
bourne. In 1852 he became Dean of Melbourne,
and in that capacity he was a picturesque
figure in the Victorian capital until the
day of his death. He grew so very old,
and yet remained so young, that at last
the idea of Dean Macartney ever dying at all
began to seem an absurdity. For the past ten
years or more his birthday has been a kind of
national event, to be commented on by the press
throughout Australia, and his progress towards
the end of his century has been a matter of
general interest. But, at last, the apparently
immortal dean died almost without any warning.
Melbourne will feel his loss keenly. If he never
did anything very striking he was at least a kindly
and honourable old man, an ornament to the
church, and an all-Australian institution. Also,
now that he is gone, many men of 70 and 80, who
formerly consoled themselves with the idea that
there was no need for them to die for many years
to come because Dean Macartney was still alive,
will suddenly begin to feel very aged indeed.
SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SriOVYS FOR COMING WEEK.

Lyceum “Ma Mie Rosette.”
Theatre Royal “The Year ’49.”
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's Theatre “ Morocco Bound.”
Theatre Royal “ The Lancashire Lass.”
Bwou Variety & Burlesque Co.
“ Ma Mie Rosette ” is going strong at the
Lyceum. At the same time the public just begins
to realise that there is a serious deficiency in this
opera somewhere. The second act changes the
subject suddenly, just when something dreadfully
wicked seems as if it might be almost on the verge
of happening, and an idea is gaining ground that
the king needn’t have been interrupted quite so
unexpectedly. As it is he has caught Rosette’s
fainting form in his arms, and is just hoisting her
up a little so as to get his weight on the other leg
when the infuriated lover bursts in and breaks up
the tableau; consequently, the general desire to
know what the monarch will do under very em-
barrassing circumstances is left ungratified.
* * * *
After “The Shamrock and the Rose ” is
done with, which is expected to be on Friday
night, “Julius Caesar” will fill the aching void at
Sydney Majesty’s. The Roman drama is to be
staged with great magnificence, and “ thirty stal-
wart men ” are advertised for to be an infuriated
Latin mob with both hands full of tumult around
the bier of the butchered conqueror. Gov. Duff
and suite will attend on opening night. Gov.
Duff has now become a perfectly tame celebrity,
and will feed out of the hand. Of late he has
developed a taste for the legitimate drama, which
he really seems to enjoy in a certain Vjored and
dreary fashion that is especially his own.
# * *
The fact that Maggie Moore has been
coining money for a week or more at Sydney
Royal out of the “Octoroon,” is a sufficient proof
of that lady’s capacity to prosper on the most un-
promising materials. Nobody save Miss Moore
would venture to play the “Octoroon,’’nowadays.
That lady succeeded in making Zoe as interestingas
she ever has been, and Mr. Russell shambled before
the public eye as Jacob M‘Closky with about as
much success as that large, coarse deceiver admits
of. The rest of the drama consists principally of
Salem Soudder —a person whose unreality is
sufficiently proved by the want of that lonesome
initial which stands up like a mast on a wreck in
the middle of the name of every genuine Amur-
rikan —and Mr. Roberts did this part better than
anything he has yet attempted. The inevitable
“ Colleen Bawn,” “ Arrah-na-Pogue,” and “The
Days of ’49 ” will fill in the last week of Maggie
Moore’s season at the Royal.

The theatrical carnival and costume-foot-
ball match happens at Sydney Association Ground
next Thursday, and promised, when last heard of,
to be even a bigger event than was generally ex-
pected. All the stage beauties now in Sydney
will help to dispense refreshments, and the chappie
who doesn’t spend his last copper like a manful
johnny at the shrine of his own special divinity is
unworthy of the name of dude. The Bulletin
suggests that a faithfully-executed cast of Ryley’s
vanished and lamented legs would make a good
sixpenny side-show.
* * * *
M‘Neill, the big, hairy, Scotch evangelist,
broke out in Sydney last Monday. The bigness
and hairiness of M‘Neill are the points which first
strike the beholder. His next most conspicuous
points are his aggressive confidence and his
whirling mode of delivery. Talmage, when he
was in Sydney, appeared to be the most wildly-
oocksure individual upon this earth, but he is a
feeble and dubious person compared to the
Highland caterah who now rages round Sydney in
his stead. When M‘Neill arrived, a large number
of local pastors assembled to welcome him, and,
when they had grovelled to him for 30 minutes
and compared him to Paul, the visitor admonished
them upon their shortcomings in a way which
made their hair almost stand on end. The gist of
his discourse was that the typical pastor is a poor,
washed-out being who is eaten up with his own
small dignity, and is petrified with etiquette
and smothered with precedent and red-tape.
M‘Neill’s average voice is a roar, and when
he made these statements at the very top of it
he broke up his audience completely. As a
humourist, however, the Rev. John is a failure.
His one attempt at a joke so far has been a dreary
witticism about “the beautiful harbour,” and for
the sake of that witticism he ought to be taken up
Johnson’s Bay in a boat, and anchored off the
Glebe Island slaughter-house until he repents and
swears off humour for the rest of his hairy exist-
ence.
* * * *
Abell and Klaer’s European Circus has
done most excellent business ever since its opening
night at Sydney. Though some people may take
exception to its not being “ horsey ” enough for
Australian taste, those who think that way must,
judging from results, be in a “ strong minority.”
The show has, to date of writing, played packed
business in all its 13 performances, including
matinees, and on Saturday last the doors had to
be closed before the advertised hour of commence-
ment in the face of many would - be patrons.
The leading equine favorite is the creamy, Nellie,
who does all the ordinary trick-pony performances,
besides a few feats of her own—and does them
apparently because she likes to, for it is next to
impossible to catch her trainer dictating to the
clever creature. On Tuesday a Govt. House party,
including Lady and the Misses Duff, patronised
the show and were greeted by a full and fashion-
able house. The programme was changed on
Wednesday, when a number of acceptable innova-
tions were introduced.
* * * m
Plant the poet underground !
Upon the simple wooden cross, that throws
A thought of Heaven o’er the grassy mound,
And softens sunshine where the daisy grows,
Carve with a kindly knife—
“ He wrote for ‘Sundry Shows,’
But death came in the midst of life:
He went to see * Morocco Bound,’
Then withered like a rose.”
« # *
The most humorous items in the produc-
tion of “Morocco Bound,” at Melb. Princess’,
were certain rampagious ducks. These low-oomedy
birds appeared in place of the swans that graced
the Squire’s fish-pond at Sydney, and they broke
the monotony of the first act by frequently
scrambling out of the tank and waddling up
stage with wet feet. The ducks were thoroughly
successful in their efforts to amuse on Saturday.
If they are sacrificed to professional jealousy, and
out out of the cast for being funny behind Elton’s
back, the entertainment will lose all its animal
magnetism. One remembers the ducks with
gratitude. Otherwise, Melbourne is nob likely to
see any points that Sydney failed to discover in
the gaudy dullness of “ Morocco Bound.” It
appears to be a mass of slack-baked dialogue
covered by a thin coating of story. A few in-
genious lyrics and glimpses of female underwear
are connected with this indigestible talk, and a
poor attempt at a variety-show crowns the dump-
ling.
# * *
Judging from a book of song-words,
“ Morocco Bound ” originally contained more
music and less conversation than now. In the
present company there is no singer, male or
female, but especially female, who can be called a
sparkling vocalist. In short, the measure of
success for a show of this description depends
upon the artists who undertake to pull it
through, and these artists are, with three or
four exceptions, not up to the particular
kind of work required of them. Neither
are the exceptions very startling. Wilfred
Shine, a good comedian, is nob mercurial;
whilst Elton, mercurial as ever, can’t warble any
better than of yore. The amusing young johnnie
person is merely a glorified reminiscence of many
idiotic dudes in British and Australian melo-
drama ; and although Miss Edith Courtenay gets
much applause for her burlesque imitation of a
sassiety maiden trying to skirt-dance, it seems
probable that an intelligent amateur could bur-
lesque herself in much the same way. _ As for the
tame baritone, and several other disappointing
performers, they chiefly serve to check the action
of the piece.
** * *
“ The Irishman,” at Melbourne Royal, is
a fairly cheerful assortment of characters and
incidents selected from Boucicault’s Irish plays.
An overwhelming bhoy, in the usual drab-caped
overcoat, periodically chokes the miserable pro-
cess-server in the square black hat. Also, he cir-
cumvents the blaggardly nephew who sets the
Law upon the young master and cherishes evil
designs against that noble pathriot’s colleen. A
praste, a furious squire, a conscientious officer,
and a faithful Norah, likewise a warm-hearted
Molly, are included in the cast, and the scenery is
old and reliable. “ The Lancashire Lass ” will suc-
ceed “The Irishman.” Maggie Moore and Co.
are expected at the Royal shortly, when business
will doubtless hum. Meanwhile, the Taylor-
Carrington season is chiefly prosperous on Satur-
day nights.
** * *
Melbourne Bijou re-opens on Saturday
(13th), at popular prices, with a variety-citwi-
comic-opera bill. Offenbach’s “M. Choufleur,”
otherwise “ Mr. Shrewsbury at Home,” is the
opera, and Miss Marie Elster has been engaged
to star in this promising experiment. Little
Percy Grainger pianoforted with the Exhibition
Concert Company on Saturday last, to the delight
of a good attendance ; and the Alexandra show
has accomplished its destiny by shutting up.
At Poverty Point.
Wilson Barrett has made a great hit with his adaptation
of Hall Caine’s novel, “The Manxman.” It is said to be
the strongest drama he has starred in since “ Silver
King.”
“ Mr. Shrewsbury at Home,” a liberal translation by
Lance Lenton of Offenbach’s “M. Choufleur restera chez
lui Id,” will be produced at Melb. Bijou as soon as the
new variety show can find room for it. “Mr. Shrews-
bury ” was tried at the Exhibition a couple of years ago,
and went merrily.
Courtneidge—he is travelling around the U.K. with fair
Miss Fortescue’s eo. and doing well—sends some indignant
remarks in a private letter upon “Go Bang,” one of the
latest London atrocities. The central figure in “Go
Bang” is an Eastern potentate, who implores one man
after another to hear a certain "spicy” story, “so very
blue,” commencing with “There was a young man of
Madras—” The joke seems to lie in everybody answering
“Ohl”—a gentle insinuation that the doggerel is very
old as well as very blue. At last the awful heathen gets
hold of a hunch of girls, and shrieks—“ There was a young
man of Madras, who—always had eggs for his tea.”
Whereupon the boss-girl winks gaily at the stalls and says,
“ Ah, that’s not the way I heard it told before." Apart
from this drivel, “Go Bang” is not considered a
brilliant success. The rest of the dialogue contains very
little Hinglish wit and humor, and even the young man
of Madras begins to pall upon sassiety after the first hour
or so.
The boy-reporter again: “Whereon the captain at
once marries Miss Warren, and others follow suit.” From
an Age criticism of “The Bush King.”
The Age’s London correspondent, speaking of Plain
Bill Holloway’s venture at Terry’s Theatre: “Mr. W. J.
Holloway has engaged an excellent company, and, with
rare self-denial for an actor-manager, does not appear in
either of the pieces which he produces.” “ Rare self-
denial ! ” Not at all. Bill is simply studying his own
interests with much more intelligence and discrimination
than he ever displayed in Australia.
The lank youth named Dorrington who shed a feeble
light over the Melb. Princess’s stage during the recent
B. and B. season is a son of those great theatrical stars,
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Kendal.
Although Mrs. Brough farewelled at Melb. last week,
she will not go to England at once, the B. and B. Co.
having arranged a season at Hobart during the opening
weeks of the Exhibition.
“ The Bush King ” was produced at Melb. Royal under
the distinguished patronage of Lord Hopetoun, Chief
Justice Madden, the omnipresent Zox, and bookmaker
Alf. Josephs. The connection between Alf. and His Ex-
cellency is closer than might be supposed. Mrs. A.
Josephs—who, by the way, is a maternal aunt to the
author of “ The Bush King ” aforesaid—recently slipped
downstairs and broke some small bones in her nose, allee
same as Lady Hopetoun.
Tommy Hudson, who coined money at Adelaide Bijou,
sailed for India on Oct. 3, taking almost his entire co.,
including Shine. Tommy always makes a small fortune
in India, but says this is his last trip, as he means to settle
down hereafter in Adelaide, where he owns much property.
“The Phrenologist,” a comedy by Mr. John W.
M'Dougall, reaches a low literary level, but is well put
together, and has considerable vivacity and entrain.
Brightly acted, it would probably make a hit; for the
average Australian audience is frequently condemned to
laugh at much inferior humour.
Mrs. Mayor Yates comes definitely on a lecturing tour
to Australia. Piloted by R.S.S. ?
Mrs. Palmer’s benefit-concert resulted in a net balance
of £250, which amount was presented to her last week at
an afternoon-tea given by Mayor and Mayoress Snowden.
The Melb. Lyric Club proposes giving the sassiety
maidens, who can neither act nor sing, a chance to display
their nether shapeliness and expensive lingerie, by pre-
senting a ballet in their next essay, “ Marjorie.”
George Musgrove’s youngest sister, “Tripper,” is a
good amateur actress, and made a successful appearance
at the Austral Salon, the other day, when she played in
“ Twenty Minutes Under an Umbrella.”
The Melb. musical world has been startled by the news
that Mine. Christian has decided to become a nun. For
sometime past Madame has been in indifferent health,
and for months she was an inmate of St. Vincent’s
Hospital, where the Sisters of Charity nursed her with
exceeding care. She is now in Sydney, and will probably
enter conventual life as a novice of St. Vincent’s. The
Other surprise of the week is the departure for Sydney
and elsewhere, en route to Cairo, of Herr Benno Scherek,
who is attached to the Sapio-Urso combination.
Surgeon O’Hara, as a witness in the De Alba lift*
accident damages case, explained the facial injuries
received by plaintiff, and said that they were the most
dreadful he had ever witnessed. They would have killed
95 per cent, of people. His fee was 500 guineas. It was
no tinkering work, and he had received 1000 guineas for
a less difficult night’s work. George O’Neill, doctor of
dental surgery, described the injuries to Madame De
Alba’s teeth and jaws. He thought his fee of 150 guineas
more than reasonable. Dr. O’Hara, by the way, is
regarded as the champion Victorian witness. Kx.-<jr. —
Purves, Q. 0.: “ How much would you have charged had
she died next morning?” “When a patient is not in a
position to pay I would not prostitute the profession by
charging a small fee.”
Adelaide Cyclorama balance-sheet, at the end of last
half-year, showed: Receipts, £1109; expenditure, £1694.
Thus the London correspondent of S.A. Advertiser:
“ The ladies who play the nude figures in the ‘ living
pictures,’ now so popular at all the music-halls, do not
really show so much as Lady Henry Somerset supposes.
Their arms and legs are covered with flesh-colored and
invisible silk ‘tights,’ and the busts, &c., are papier-
mach6 imitations. Lady Henry unfortunately did not
realise this, and after a visit to the Empire or the ‘ Pav.'
(she doesn’t say which) wrote a scream of horror to the
Times. As a result the halls have been fuller than ever,
and more nude pictures are in preparation.”
Fillis, the circus man, says the weather has robbed him
of £BOOO. Something in this. Whenever an exceptionally
severe drought was on in Victorian country districts,
the advent of Fillis’s circus almost invariably broke it up,
and Fillis, too, as it turns out.
The notice of Madame Christian’s last appearance in
Melbourne makes a musical amateur think of her first
appearance in Sydney as a young woman not much over
20, very simply dressed, and with not a sign of make-up.
It was June 13th, 1873, in the old, Masonic Hall, at the
first of Arabella Goddard’s concerts, of which R. S. Smythe
was manager. The tickets were half-a-guinea ; and the
assisting vocalists were “Mrs. Smythe, Miss Christian,
and Mr. Andrew Fairfax.” The contralto was quite
unknown, and the Herald gave her just two encouraging
lines. For sixteen years from that night, not only over
all the Australias, but in South Africa and England, the
Much-Travelled never tired of sounding the praises of
“ the favourite contralto.” Every sub-editor and musical
critic knew the burden of his song. Tub Bulletin
always maintained that Smythe discovered Madame
Christian: he so persistently boomed her that his life
might be divided into two periods—before and after the
Christian era. Not only did he always include “ the
charming contralto” in his concert companies ; but some-
times he did most outrageous things. Once, in Maoriland,
he yoked her with the Rev. Charles Clark ; another lime,
in Melbourne Opera House, he arranged for her' to sine
the National Anathema at one of Archibald Forbes’ lec-
tures. If Smythe would only give us the history of those
17 years, it would be quite as entertaining as the most
interesting chapter in Daudet’s “Femme d’Artistes.”
New song, “ The Bogus Man ’’—who takes a theatre.
Expect the news that Williamson has concluded terms
with Augustus Harris for an opera-troupe.
While the theatre-dog is unlucky, the theatre cat is un-
killable, even after she rubs against Hamlet’s leg during
the soliloquy.
Sara Bernhardt is no lover of diamonds. She says that
they kill the best expression of the face, put out the fire
of the eyes, pale the tints of the ears, make the finest
teeth look like porcelain. “ I would wear,” she says,
“beads or Egyptian coins, but diamonds—no, no, no.”
Patchett Martin tells an English paper how he once
took an Australian actor to see Irving as Romeo. In the
middle of the hush that followed one of Irving’s best
apostrophes, Martin’s friend dug him in the ribs and ex-
claimed in a voice heard all over the theatre : “ Oh, that’s
appalling 1 You should just see me in the balcony-scene.”

(“ Poverty Point ” continued on page 23.)
A first attempt to form a Country party
in the Vic. Assembly was not very promising.
After 31 members had assembled in a committee-
room, and a chairman had touched upon the eternal
subject of rural industries, Alfred Deakin came
along as an uninvited guest to implore the
party not to form itself at all, Deakin having
peacefully withdrawn, Francis Longmore in-
timated that he couldn’t think of sitting in the
same party or same room with Staughton, the
hard-shell Tory. Exit Longmore. Then Murray,
of Warrnambool, stated that he had undergone
conversion since Patterson’s Parliament broke up,
and was now a Labor member. The flight of
Murray ensued, and the party finally decided to
adjourn its policy for the present.

“ IMITATION
is tiie
SINCE REST FLAT! ERY.”
The articles most imitated are
CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS.
WHY?
BECAUSE they have the best reputation and
are most in demand by the public, consequently,
every dishonest trader tries to trade on their fame
and renown.
It is really wonderful that the Australian people
are so slow to see the truth as regards the. un-
scrupulous quacks and charlatans who prey on
the credulity of the Australian public. Scarcely a
week ever passes but what the press exposes the
barefaced and shameful practices of some of th se
harpies, yet, in face of all they seem to thrive, and
the paper which hounds them down most thrives
fattest on their advertisements and cracks cham-
pagne over each balance-sheet. Clements Tonic
and Fletcher’s Pills have never yet stooped to
deception and misrepresentation. They are
scientific therapeutical agents, and evidence as to
their value can be found in every district, and
such being the case it is unnecessary to further
extol their virtues.

A certain eminent titled Australian Q.O.
began life as a “ buttons.”
West Australia, Victoria, and S.A, have
now all got natives as Premiers.
In the new Vic. Assembly there are 3
Andersons, 2 Isaacs’s, 2 Williams’s, 2 Turners and
3 Smiths.
S. M. .Herald now al ways alludes to Admiral
Bowden-Smith as “His Excellency the Naval
Commander-in Chief.”
The lady who works the oracle at the chief
Sydney spiritualistic seances is named Mellon.
A melon among pumpkins.
Already S.A. Agent-General Playford
sighs to return to Adelaide, owing to the continued
ill-health of his wife, who loathes the English
climate.
Bent, ex-M.P. for Brighton, and ex-
Speaker of Vic. Assembly, was the fattest man
in his constituency. His successor, Moule, is one
of the thinnest.
Lord Fingall, lately at Coolgardie, is
nephew of the Redemptorist missionary, Hon. and
Rev, Father Plunkett, who visited Australia some
little time back.
Street, the Footscray (Vic.) councillor, who
retired in the recent election in favor of Labor-
member Hancock, is the living double of S.A.
Premier Kingston.
Dean Marryat, who for a time is supreme
in S.A. Anglican circles, is a nephew of Capt.
Marryat, the novelist, and is probably the fattest
cleric in Australia.
“Miss Adey Brunei,” the Melbourne
reciter, is a niece of Sir William Jenner, Queen
Vic. ’s doctor. He married a Miss Adey, who was
Miss Brunei’s aunt.
Why does the authoress of “The Yellow
Aster,” who is one of the apostles of the New
Woman, allow her name to remain unchanged ?
Why isn’t she now Mrs. Womanton Caffyn ?
The first service which Vic.’s Bart.,
Clarke, rendered to his bleeding country after
being sworn in last week was to fall back on the
front Govt, bench into a sound, snoresome snooze.
W. H. Masters, founder of Melbourne’s
telephone system, who died t’other day, is the
third director of the Evening Standard who has
departed this life. William Wilson and Currie
were the others.
Both the present Vic. Minister of Defence,
Sargood, and the late Minister, R. Reid, are soft-
goods merchants. What is the connection be-
tween gunpowder and grenadine, bullets and
blankets, fire and flannels, shooting and shoddy ?
Seldom has there been a worse misnomer
than the pending Queensland “Judges Disqualifi-
cation Bill.” The Bill does not disqualify anv
Judge; it disqualifies a barrister who desires to
appear in the court over which his father presides.
Premier Kingston has added another to
his list of enemies. First Baker, then Symon,
Downer, and now Chief Justice Way. The latter,
by the way, has just made a most injudicious
attack on the Premier from the Supreme Court
bench.
Cuthbert, new Vic. Solicitor - General,
belongs to the well-known legal firm of Cuthbert,
Hamilton and Wynne, Strange to say, partner
Wynne was Postmaster-General in the Patterson
Government just routed by Cuthbert’s leader,
George Turner.
Verbatim copy of a letter from a newly-
appointed N.S. Wales J.P. to the local (South
Coast) Police Magistrate :
“Deer Sur,—l rite to let you know that I ave been
made a j p and it will give me grate^pleasure to cohabit
with you on the Binch.”
Of the new Vic. Ministry the Premier,
Attorney-General, Chief Secretary, Minister of
Lands, and Minister of Works, are natives. With
Sargood and Cuthbert in the team, however, it
will be difficult for these young Australians to
keep pace with their Liberal aspirations.
A lately-deceased Victorian plutocrat was,
during his life-time, credited with the largest
natural family in the province. The text of the
will discloses no terms for their provision, which
might be accepted as rather unnatural were it not
known that he provided for them long ago.
A son of ex-Governor Bowen, of Banana-
land, is steward of the estates of Robert Herbert,
erst Colonial Secretary of the same province.
Herbert is rich, and this young gentleman is heir-

attached to the Bowen-Herbert friendship.
A. G. Taylor is writing in Sydney Truth
some excellent satirical articles on “John Bull’s
Calf, or the Land of the Kangaroo,” and signing
same “ Max O’Rell.” Sam Cook, general manager
of S.M. Herald, actually believed the other day
that they did come from the pen of Max O’Rell.
In S.A. Assembly, the other day, Solomon,
M.P., attacking Premier Kingston in re some
statement which he doubted, quoted Tennyson’s
verdict that “A lie which is half a truth is a
harder matter to fight.” “ Well,” retorted King-
ston, “ that is 50 per cent, above your average.”
Dr. Renwick, of Sydney, now brass-plates
himself “Sir Arthur Renwick, M.D.,” but the
public are not aware by any means that he was
bebaubled chiefly by reason of his medical prowess.
On the contrary, it strikes the world that his
knightly status is mostly as an Exhibition-boss.
Vic, Customs Minister Best has, or had,
his father as a non-clerical in the depart-
ment over which he presides. He has a brother a
letter-carrier in Melb. G.P.0., and he himself
was a clerk in the office of his father-in-law (the
late G. D. Langridge), in whose chair he now sits
at the Customs House.
Judge Hamilton, of Vic, County Court,
remarkable for incisiveness and absence of cere-
mony, recognising a frequent visitor to his court
in the witness-box, accosted him with, “Well,
Jorkins, you here again ?” “Yes, your Honor,”
replied defendant Jorkins, “I do not like to pay
away money without consulting you.”
Richardson, late Minister of Yic. Rail*

While Justice Williams was summing-up
in the big railway-case and squirting verbal vitriol
over Speight, Richard walked out, and turned
round looking the Judge earnestly in the face.
Next day Mr. Williams’ son-associate handed a
note from the Bench to Speight’s solicitors, telling
Richard that he was not to do it again.
Dear Bulletin, —Miss Muffy Chirnside
as was is a brick. The Yankee millionairess
squanders thousands to marry the worn-out, dissi-
pated, pauper-holder of a title. Miss Chirnside

marries a son of the soil without title. She
deserves to be the mother of Australia’s first
President.—V.
Some Melb. University constituents want
to get rid of a professor or two. So at a recent
meeting of Council there were references to an
imaginary University, where one professor in-
dulges in “ senile witticisms,” and another in
“inebriated twaddle.” The sensible plan would
be to prescribe terms of five years instead of life-
appointments, as now.
Lord Brassey visits Australia early next
year in the old Sunbeam. Mrs. Brassey No. 2is
young and handsome. In India, last January,
when a travelling Australian visited the yacht,
Brassey presented him thus : “ Mr. Brigaloo, of
Australia, my dear. Mr. Brigaloo visited the
yacht when we were in Sydney some years ago.”
Awkward for Mrs. Brassey No. 2.
Explorer Carr-Boyd has christened two
peaks off Murchison way the Argus and Austra-
lasian in compliment, as he reports, to Wilson
and Mackinnon, and these journals now refer to
him as “ the courageous and competent bush-
traveller.” This is a forgiving world. Seven years
ago, Carr-Boyd demanded .£5OOO libel-damages
from the Argus, and the case went into court.
Gov. Hopetoun had a birthday on the day
that Turner’s new Government was born and the
Patterson gang went out. The young man was
35, though he only looks 20, save when his hat is
off. Patterson wished him many happy returns
of the day, to which His Ex. murmured abstrac-
tedly, “The same to you!” Patterson retailed
this afterwards and said, “ I wonder whether he
meant it?”
Very few men wore a suit of clothes to
better advantage than the late Martin Loughlin,
The gilded Martin was very proud of his fine
physical proportions, and often related the many
compliments received by him from his London
tailors. _ One day, while walking in the Strand,
the Racing King was tapped on the arm. “Beg
pardon, Mr. Loughlin, but T’rn proud of you. It’s
a glorious fit.' Turning round, be found it was

An Argus criticism of “ Rolf Boldre-
wood’s” latest work The sketches of life in
‘The Summer Isles of Eden’ are full of the
purple light of the Southern seas, and may be
compared favourably with Mr. Stevenson’s more
elaborate, more sentimental, and more artificial
pictures of the same world. ‘ Rolf Boldrewood ’
has succeeded in making a very entertaining
book.” That’s so—he made it. Which must be
all very pleasing to Louis Becke.
Minister Garrard has accepted an invita-
tion to eat a dinner cooked by the girls of the
Parramatta Industrial School. Mr. Garrard is a
sound, practical cook, and has for years made
personal study of the best ways of producing the
most nutritious food. He often lands home with
a bag of some fancy meal for breakfast use, and
spends an hour or so making a sample dish. Of
all things farinaceous he knows the qualities, and
of sound, digestible food generally he can talk with
scientific experience.
The other day there was mighty jubilation
in Sydney over the departure of a number of
military persons to India, whither they were going
to learn their trade. One of them is an ingenuous
youth who joined the English navy as a midship-
man, or something of that sort, in ’63—31 years
ago—so that he cannot now be much below 50.
It is hardly fair that N.S. Wales should have to
pay for his instruction at that age. If he doesn’t
already know his business, it is too late to learn it.
The day after the general elections a silly
rumor was rife in Melb. that ex-Speaker Bent had
suicided. A sub-editor of one of the evening
“pypers” telephoning to the House, was answered
byTom in person. This duinb-foundered the scribe
fora second, and Tom enquired simply, “What
do you want?” “Oh,” replied the newspaper-
man, “I wished to know who are the candidates
for the Speakership ? ” “ Dunno,” replied Tommy,
as he rung off. A good “ bluff.”
Bell, pioneer and solitary settler on Sun-
day Island, in the Kermadecs, landed in Auckland
(M.L.) from the cruiser Rapid the other day.
With his Kermadeo mail-bag slung on his shoul-
der he stepped on to Queen-street wharf bare-
footed. When skipper Fairchild, of the Govt,
steamer Hinemoa, tried to bluff him off the
island, Bell threatened to bombard him. Bell has
a famdy of three children ; two of his daughters,
who are in Maoriland, are said to be as strong as
three average men.
The supporters of a certain Melb. news-
paper-proprietor, beaten at the Victorian general
election, were arranging a banquet to console him
for his defeat. The poor little man actually sug-
gested to a member of committee that he would
appreciate it a great deal more if they would
devote the money to paying his election expenses.
As a result, it is likely he will get neither banquet
nor money. .ZEsop’s fable over again : the dog
with the bone and the reflection in the water —
dog’s name being Toby.
-It is estimated, by those likely to know,
that S. A. Premier Kingston, Q.C., sacrifices, at
least, ,£2OOO a year by neglecting his profession
for politics. During the last 15 months he has
kept so assiduously to his Ministerial work that
he has barely been as many times inside his
private office, and his late partner has severed
connection with him, because of the consistent
manner in which he puts State matters before
professional ones. “Some day I’ll strike it rich
in mining,” he says, for he is a plucky speculator.
The cables say that Simon Fraser, Vic.
delegate to Canada—the gentleman who paid 2000
guineas for his portrait by Millais—has been
having a controversy with comrade John, Burns,
in London. This really ought to be excellent
reading when the mail brings the papers along.
Burns is a slogging writer, with a nice talent for
epigrams, whereas I’laser is a doddering old boy,

1 hraser against Fraser, in fact.
The writer of the lately-published book
Ihe Lives of Twelve Bad Men ; original studies
of eminent scoundrels,” includes Ned Kelly, the
bushranger, in his Valhalla of villains. He makes
a great mistake about Kelly’s hanging. He draws
a picture of Ned cowering just before his execu-
tion, and having to be supported to the gallows.
This certainly does not agree with the testimony
of those who were present to see the bushranger
die. They say that Kelly “ pegged out ” with un-
flinching courage, manifesting neither desperate
bravado nor craven fear.
Tawhaio, the defunct Maori king, left
behind him a harem of 37 wives. To prevent the
aged king, in his peregrinations among his sub-
jects, adding to the list of favorites, the sternest
and most forbidding-looking of his wahines, by
common consent, accompanied his majesty. She
sat beside Tawhaio in the buggy during his
rounds, and effectually frowned upon the chiefs
who, according to immemorial custom, pressed
their brown-skinned maidens upon his Nibs. Thus
the string of concubines who occupied the royal
whare was kept within the number stated. 3
The inventor of the impressionist-school
of painting is said to have stumbled upon it qnite
promiscuously. He was accustomed to work in a

being at hand, he cut the result of this accident
out of his pants, framed it, and sent it along. ]>

Amongst the visitors to Sydney block last
week was the octogenarian Wm. Richman Watt
a contemporary of Wentworth’s, and member for
Carcoar in the first N.S.W. Parliament under the
extended franchise. Mr. Watt’s homestead is at
Bumbaldry, near Grenfell, where the Watt family
were pioneers before the solitude of the neighbor-
liood was broken by the “ Wedtiin ” rush in ’6G
Prior to that, Mr. Watt prepared to build a house
at the old spot, and had all the materials upon the
ground, but the rush altered his plans. The
“material ” lies there still unused, and Mr. Walt
rests content with the hospitable old homestead.
Among things not generally known is the
fact that Q. Govt, offered John Robb .£lOO 000 to
square bis =£262,000 deviations claim over the
Cairns railway. Robb refused. The Govt, was
“careful ” in the appointment of arbitrators, with
the result that the contractor recovered .£2O 000
at a cost of =£26,000 in costs. Robb made’the
usual mistake of not laying to his book. As long
as he kept to railway-contracting he made money
(£.124,000 on the Cairns contract alone), and in
’B9 he had a credit-balance of nearly half-a-
million; but when he started squatting, sugar-
planting and land-speculating he lost band-over-

Mrs. Macalister, who died lately in Bris-
bane at an advanced age, was a connecting link
between the Queensland of to-day and that of the
pre-Separation period. Her husband was a poli-
tician of narrow, unsympathetic, but restlessly
active proclivities, who managed, against great
odds, to grasp the Premiership. He left no per-
manent impression, for he was constitutionally
incapable of nourishing large ideas. The part lie
took in the fight for Queensland autonomy was
all provided for him, and it was his mere restless-
ness which made him notable. The premiership
he practically bartered for the billet of Agent-
General.
Dear Bulletin, —Your recent par. re Mr.
George Anderson, Master of Melb. Mint, recalls
to the writer the good old pre-ballot times when
Mr. Anderson was one of the three candidates for
Glasgow. I question if any other candidate in
the United Kingdom was “barracked’’ more by
the Catholics, who made his annual address to his
constituents, in the City Hall, an occasion not yet
forgotten by Mr. Anderson. Mr. A. received his
appointment from Gladstone, who took that
means of getting rid of a member who had an
unpleasant manner of asking questions which it
did not always suit the Liberal Government to
answer.—Yours, An Elector of the Time.
When the Redmonds were lecturing in
Maoriland, a well-known Auckland Irishman took
them in, boarded and lodged them on a royal
scale, and drove them around in bis trap to see all
the available scenery. A few years later, the
Parnellite disruption came, and "their late host
heard with profound disgust of the attitude of the
Redmonds in the matter. Whereupon he wrote
to the elder of the pair something to this effect:
“ Sorr,—When you were out here I had great
pleasure in driving yon round to see the country.
If yon come out here again I’ll have great pleasure
in driving yon over an embankment, and breaking
your neck. Yours, etc. .”
The combative Speight has moved for a
new trial against Melbourne Age Syme. He
wants to rechristen the latter “Doomsday David.”
A poetical termination to the suit should be the
mutual bankruptcy of both the litigants, with the

the free and bounding billows in the direction of
Argentina. In the meantime ;

Since tobacco was first introduced in Europe, or
at least in England, about three hundred years
ago, its consumption has ever been increasing,
like coffee and tea. Up to the last century a pipe
was a luxury within reach only of the so-called
“ better classe,” as it was so expensive that tor a
shilling people only got in tobacco the weight of
that coin in silver. Times have undoubtedly
changed for the better in this respect, as, in our
days, any tobacconist will give you a packet con-
taining eight of Frossard’s Cavours for a similar
piece of money. These cigars are mild and
aromatic, and are certainly the best value that has
ever been brought to Australia. *

No head of expense in Australia has grown

The Q. Parliamentary Labor-party was
against the now-collapsed shearers’ strike. Local
leaders, however, were for it, and were eventually
rewarded by having to call off the strike, acknow-
ledge failure, and see their orders disobeyed by
their followers.
The plausible C, J. Moran, whom the
Cooigardie men were fools enough to return to
W.A. Parliament as an Oppositionist, instead of
the tried De Hamel, has become a pronounced
Govt, supporter, and backs the Forrest crowd at
every opportunity.
Imagining himself still at ’Ome, no doubt,

From its many harbor strongholds, predatory cruisers
would be able to sweep our trade routes to and from
Africa, India and Australasia, and thus deal a deadly blow
to our interests in those ocean highways.
The Age handles the land-tax very gin-
gerly. It gives the Government a programme:
Tariff Revision, Railway, Electoral, Parlia-
mentary and Banking Reform, but conveniently
forgets the tax on unimproved land values. David
is of the landed gentry himself.
Re Adrian Knox’s woefully unsuccessful
attempt to abolish payment of members in N.S.W.,
the only wonder is that such persons as some of
those who supported him dared rise in their
places and speak on the very evening of the day
when they had pouched every man his £25 cheque.
The spleen-swollen features of Backbone
Patterson were a matter of comment at the swear-
ing-in of Vic. Parliament last week. The few
peevish strictures he attempted to cloak with a
srocodile leer, resembled the squeaking of a dis-
appointed rodent attacking a leaden corpse-casket.
Abbott, M.P. (N.S.W.): “Garrard and
Cameron managed to attend to their Parlia-
mentary duties when there was no payment of
members and when they were employed at manual
labor. Yes, they “managed.” Garrard (loq.) ;
“I wouldn’t ask a dog to go through what I
experienced then.”
It has been estimated, in view of approach-
ing income-tax, that the bulk of N.S.W. lawyers
and doctors will oppose the Bill, and that the
apposition will be fiercest among those of the
lowest incomes. Men in these professions, whose
incomes barely reach the exempt figures, are
expected to fight the Bill tooth and nail.
Graham Berry’s unanimous selection as
Speaker of Vic. Assembly is a recognition of the
Liberal veteran’s long and arduous public life. A
point generously overlooked by the House is the
question of his physical fitness for the post. Will
the long night sittings overtask the old man’s
great age, and fast increasing bodily feebleness?
In Victoria the Jews form less than one-
two hundredth of the population—and more than
one-twelfth of the Legislature. In other words,
the Chosen have got sixteen times more than their
“proper” share of representation. Truly the seed
of Abraham is irrepressible and the time is steadily
corning nearer when Cohen shall own the earth.
It must have made Max Hirsch think hard
when he saw that Frank Madden had positively
refused, on behalf of the conservatives, to let him
on the committee of the proposed Melb. Reform
Club. Max was prime Freetrade barracker at
elections and supplied all the brains used in the
conservative campaign. He is a sucked orange.
Throw him away.
Remarkable that, although every Victorian
Crown Minister procures an elaborate portfolio
and travelling-bag, at State expense, lettered
“ Commissioner of ,” he never leaves it behind
for his successor. Consequently, every change of
Ministry means a junior civil-servant’s salary in
portfolios alone. And these are the men who talk
of “rigid economy !”
The S.A. beer excise was first collected on
the night of Tuesday, Sept. 25, yet, at 2d. per
gallon, the Treasurer hopes to realise .£30,000 by
the end of the financial year, the average annual
consumption per head being reckoned at about
14 gals. The hotelkeepers are making an attempt
to squeeze about double the amount of the extra
beer and spirit duties out of the drinking public.

A SABBATH SCENE IN ANCIENT EGYPT.
(From sculptures—by The Bulletin’s own Egyptologist).
Here you see Amen-Hoteph taking a bottle out of Cheops’ Pyramid, where he had
secreted it on the previous day.
NOTE: -Tickel-en-Rhibb, Mr. Hoteph’s wife’s mother, had been elected Lady Mayor of
Thebes, and had suppressed all clubs. In fact, for a period of 2000 years the bulwarks
of Egyptian liberty were shaken to their foundation by drastic Sabbatarian legislation.
Tickel was finally mummified, and a reaction set in.
realised for the first time. His following on the
Opposition benches numbered exactly six. The
Opposition corner —otherwise the independent
oppositionists —were 26 strong, but the lonesome
half-dozen afore-mentioned were all that remained
to represent the alleged Foreign-trade reaction in
Victoria.
Re selling State railways to “ private
enterprise.” Bagehot, admitting that there
would be no necessity for a second Chamber if the
Commons were perfect, points out that the latter
has, or then had, 200 members for railways.
Moral: When the State does not control the rail-
ways the railway companies (as in America)
control the State. He who controls locomotion
controls the nation.
The law of One Man one Vote, passed
three years ago by a “cronk” Vic. Assembly,
which knew quite well what was going to happen,
lies buried tor the present in the Leg. Council.
The new Labor Party will have it resurrected,
and a row will ensue. Sargood, who seems
destined to bring the Turner Government to ruin,
is a Some Men Six Votes kind of person. That’s
where his Liberalism comes in.
The most interested, and sometimes the
most excited, auditors in Q. Parliament are the
Labor - party’s women folks. Labor - leader
Glassey’s daughter is one of the most regular
attendants, and appears to regard all her father’s
caustic criticisms of the crooked Nelson Govern-
ment as so many huge jokes. “Society” ladies
stand no show against the labor ladies, who dis-
respectfully elbow them into the back row.
Nominee M. ! sL.C. make bad censors of
M.’sL.A. When they reproach members of As-

overhandedly for seats they direct public attention
to their own exertions for seats in the Council.
The average M.L.A. is not a high-minded indi-
vidual in his canvass, but the average M.L.C.’s
labored process of securing Ministerial favor is,
while more secret, not a bit more elevated. And,
on another topic. Members of the N.S.W.
Council sneeringly denounced Assembly members
the other day for their anxious grabbing at Public
Works Committee billets, but when their own
turn came avaricious indecency was as scandalously
exhibited.
Australian Star, stigmatising ex-Chief
Justice Lilley as the Judge whom Windeyer van-
quished, denounces him as an agitator who proves
by his attitude to the recently-carried coercion
bill that he does not want the reign of sound law
in Queensland. That is a myopic view of Lilley’s
relation to the question raised. Lilley’s objection
to the new “coercion” law is that he considers
the old laws, if enforced, sufficient for the occasion.
A wealth-tax in Victoria is impossible just
now, apart from the question of “ paper ” liabili-
ties, which numberless affluent persons would
crawl behind and use as shelters from the tax-
collector. Its imposition would open up the awful
question of reconstructed bank deposit values. A
man credited with .£lO,OOO worth of deposits at
current market rates might maintain that he was
justified in valuing them at next to nothing. A
delicate matter to bring into Court.
Within the last two years 11 lives
have been lost in the Ipswich and Bundamba
colleries. Boodlewraith is not troubled thereat.
Within the last 2J years there have been
not fewer than 12 murders in the Mackay dis-
trict, and the perpetrators are still at large.
Boodlewraith is not troubled thereat. But imme-
diately woolsheds are burnt down, out comes the
Northern Fat Man with a Peace Preservation
Bill worthy of the direst days of Buckshot Forster.
So far, a title has been anything but a
Mascotte in Australasian politics. Stout has not
yet recovered from his bebaublement, and John
Downer is out —not in. MTlwraith’s star is on
the down grade ; Parkes seems pretty well snuffed
out; Dibbs howls at the outer gate; Patterson is
bust; and Berry in the Vic. general election dared
not use his title on his election-bills, but had to
appeal to the electors as plain Graham Berry.
And these examples by no means exhaust the
list.
Kingston’s Land and Income-tax proposals
are nearly as drastic as the present Maoriland
imposts. S.A. Govt, proposes to double the
present £d. tax on unimproved land-values com-
mencing at £5000; income-tax of 4|d. on all
incomes derived from personal exertion up to
<£looo ; fid. to Is. above .£lOOO ; additional tax of
20 p.c. on unimproved land-values owned by
absentees. The Govt, has the solid support of the
Labor-members, and claims a majority in both
Assembly and Council.
In 1883 the people of Maoriland drank
only half as much spirits per head as in 1878, only
a little more than one-third as much wine, and
less than one-third as much imported beer, while
the demand for “ colonial ” beer had fallen off
about 20 per cent. Taking him in all his various
thirsts, the Maorilander only drinks half as much
as he did 16 years ago. Which shows either
that anti-liquor legislation makes the people give
up drink, or else that when people give up drink
they take to passing anti-liquor legislation.
Melb. Akgus lately gave way to the depravity
of letters signed “Worker,” “Workingman,”
“Worker No. 2,” etc., etc., in which the deluded
toiler and moiler pathetically pleads for political
guidance, and displays the self-abasement of a
conscientious jackass in such sentences as this ;
“We have no knowledge as to which is the right
side to take in the coming election,” “ We look to
you as the best judge to decide for us.” This
kind of “working man,” if he is not an office
spook, ought to have a keeper to appeal to.
Alex. Brown, M.L.C. (N.S.W.), holds an
“ office of profit ” as Chairman of Hunter River
Water Board, and sticks like a limpet to his
M.L.C.-ship. The Constitution Act, while for-
bidding a man to hold any but a Cabinet office
with a seat in the Assembly, is silent about the
Council. An M.L.C. might be a railway-porter
so far as the law is concerned. The Foreign-trade
M.L.A. who “ drew attention ’ to Brown—Brown
belongs to the Dibbs faction—is alleged to hold a
similar “office of profit ” himself, by the yvay.
The German opinion of the Costa Rica
Packet business is that the Dutch Government
erred only in being too lenient ! The haughty
Australian, it appears, wants to boss the Malay
archipelago as well as Oceania, “and, if Sydney
could have its way,” opines the Cologne Gazette,
“even the German flag would fly no longer in
New Guinea or the Marshalls.” The Dutchmen
are counselled to scout the .notion of compensa-
tion, and force the matter to arbitration, “ the
result of which cannot be doubted.” Apparently
not—if sauerkraut is to have a finger in the pie 1
Ninian Melville, after fourteen consecu-
tive years in N.S.W. Parliament and four years in
the well-paid billet of chairman of committees, has
bankrupted—liabilities dllBoo, assets .£2OO. His
schedule describes him simply as an unemployed
person residing in a cheap Sydney suburb. Mel-
viJle had a profitable undertaking business onca
upon a time, but he left it for politics, and then
politics left him, and in his old age he goes tha
way of politicians in general. The man who can
get a living out of corpses should stick to corpses.
In the long run, they crush ' than
live voters.
N. Premier Reid’s little explanation .
“ I have always opposed payment of members and
shall continue to do so until it is proved that it
produces a better House. After the Act was
passed in ’B9, I paid .£550 back into the Treasury,
but when those members who had supported the
system and those who had opposed it had been
before the electors, I felt that to refuse payment
any longer would seem like an attempt to acquire
praise for a sort of fictitious credit over one’s
fellows.” Which, being interpreted into the
vulgate, meaneth : “ After the Act was passed in
’B9, I paid £550 back into the Treasury, but when
I—ahem ! got married,” &c., &c. Why doesn’t
George own up like a man—a married man?
The unspeakable greed of the Northen
planters provokes them to the most suicidal policy,
as witness the decimation of their obedient bond-
slaves, the Polynesians. Witness also the steri-
lisation through too frequent cropping of some of
the fairest sugar-lands on the Mary. Witness
also this—the latest : A cane-disease is breaking
out in the Burnett and Isis districts. The cane
begins to run to a gummy liquid which it tends to
secrete instead of sugar. The disease appears to
have originated in the Woongarra district, and is
said to have arisen from the too frequent planting
of cane in the one soil. Northern planters will
crop cane 15 years from the one field, and then
look paralysed when the exhausted alluvial cries,
“ Hold, enough !”
Said a business man, recently (after busi-
ness hours): “We have travelled far since
Shakespeare’s time. He depicted the spirit that
wanted flesh in payment of debt. Shylock is
dead, and the world in these days of bankruptcy-
laws, big secure life - policies, and Married
Women’s Property Acts, to say nothing of effec-
tual nuptial and post-nuptial settlements, no
longer allows payment in flesh. It first limited
the creditor to the skin, then the singlet. After-
wards the creditor fought for the right to levy on
the waistcoat. Then he struggled for the debtor’s
coat; to-day he is making a last despairing clutch
at his overcoat,” The moral conveyed in this
parable is that commercial transactions are very
nearly down to the naked bedrock of confidence.
Dear Bulletin, —Can you tell me why
Eight Hours’ day was not considered a “ public ”
holiday for the N.S.W. law courts? The Judges
refused to adjourn cases over Monday, Oct. Ist,
on the ground that they did not recognise
Demonstration • day as “a holiday for Us.”
Why? The birthdays of Queen Victoria of
England, and Albert Edward, Prince of Wales,
are considered fitting occasions for closing the
law-courts all over Australia. They are holidays
by Act of Parliament. Demonstration-day—the
people’s day—is only a holiday by proclamation,
and may be disregarded at will by the people’s
highly-paid servants —or masters ? Isn’t any
“democratic” representative going to call atten-
tion to this piece of insolence ? Or is Demon-
stration-day going to be merely a holiday for the
“lowah ordabs, you know ?”— Democrat.
Vic. Attorney-General Isaacs must fight
for re-election at Bogong against Ferguson, ex-
member for the Ovens district. I. Isaacs ran his
little brother Johnny for the latter constituency
and ran Ferguson out, wherefore that irate
follower of Patterson has betaken himself to
Bogong out of pure cussedness. It is a droll busi-
ness altogether, this hauling of brother Johnny
into politics. The original Isaacs, who carries
most of the family brains in his own personal
head, is likely to find Johnny a serious handicap
as time goes on, although the fraternal alliance
will give him the weight of a dual voter in the
House. The Attorney-General will count as two
on a division —self and Johnny. Meanwhile, he
has nothing to fear from Ferguson’s opposition,
except a little expense. Fergy is on a wild goose-
chase, with a reasonable chance of losing his £5O
deposit.
Editor Bulletin,— “ No venality about
Speight.” No. But Speight had something about
him that put away the millions just as easily.
Goodfellowship. Speight went about in triumphal
tours putting gilt on every M.P.’s gingerbread.
He was even the good fellow with such as C. E.
Jones and Mason. They asked for stone and
took the cake. “ The money was there to spend,’'
say you. There were Parliamentary appropria-
tions, and Speight exceeded everyone of them.
He is no construction manager, but I would take
him on again for the traffic. He is a Napoleon
for knowing the names of his men, and is popular
with them to idolatry. I would put over him a
man who doesn’t know anything about railways—
say Weigall, Vic. Curator of Intestate Estates.
Weigall is a man who has developed economy to a
vice, and a Speight-Weigall combination would
make the railways.—F.
The Bulletin is not in a position to pro-
nounce on the merits of the subjoined case, but it
is a ghastly thing that so many civil-servants and
ex-civil-servants, all over Australia, can truthfully
utter similar wails of despair :
Editor Bulletin, —“Civil-servants always vote Conser-
vative, they also vote Freetrade.” Although a C.S.
(believing him a Protectionist and Democrat) I voted for
Dibbs. Because I did not see fit to dishonor myself, in a
way I cannot here specify, I incurred the enmity of a
high official, who sent in several false reports to the
“chief,” with the result that when retrenchment came 1
had to go. I held a responsible position, and had the
confidence alike of the public and every superior officer I
had ever served under. 1 worked an average of three
hours per day overtime for years (without extra pay) in
the interests of the service. I was on permanent staff,
and yet dozens of temporary officers were retained, and
one was appointed to my position. Although I had
high legal opinion that the C.S. Act had been violated in
my case, and there were many aggravating circumstances
surrounding it which increased the hardship, the Dibbs
Government declined either a reconsideration or an
investigation into my charges of malicious misrepresenta-
tion against the officer indicated. What matters how
O. vote after that? They seemingly have no rights to

The ghoulish humor of sexual murders is
phosphorescently presented in the latest Melb.
wife-butchery case, where, as also in the recent
life-bashiug performance upon his paramour by a
negro at Port Melbourne, the little home-nest of
the principals was ornamented with gaily-colored
prints of “The Springtide of Love.” One more
illustration of the fact that True Love—the boiling,
passionate, red-hot lava of the amative animal—
leads to more murders than any other known
cause—drink included! On the tombstone of
every felon who murders his wife might be written
truthfully —“ He loved too largely.” Extremes
meet. The alpine penumbras of Love infringe
momentarily on the border-line of Hate, and the
electric crash of opposing clouds loosens the
lightning of unpremeditated murder. No wife
should be satisfied that her husband truly loves
her until he starts to saw her throat, or trepan
her skull with a meat-axe.
• • •
Mrs. Wash, murdered by her husband in
Melb. last week, was an Adelaide schoolmate of
Martha Needle, now under sentence of death.
Mrs. Wash, at the time of the Needle poisoning
discovery, told a friend that the condemned
woman, as a child, had a penchant for toxicology
and continually bought poison to “ fix-up ” cats
and dogs. Which seems to place the unfortunate
Martha in the light of a poisoning maniac. By the
strange workings of Fate, one woman was
butchered last week, while her schoolmate lies in
gaol awaiting a violent death on the scaffold.

Maggie Moore, at the end of the “ Struck
Oil ” season at Sydney Royal, gave a matinee for
the local charities. The Benevolent Asylum
authorities marched such of the recipients of their
doles as would accept tickets a mile through the
most crowded streets from the Asylum to the
theatre. Naturally, all who had a rag of self-
respect left declined with or without thanks.
The man or woman who would submit to such a
degradation for 2£d. a day, or its equivalent in
food, is lost beyond redemption.

Editor Bulletin, —“The much-discussed
Ocean-street (Sydney) cable-tram has to earn
£lB every day to pay interest on construction.”
Yes, and £l4 to pay wages of gripinen and con-
ductors, £lO for renewal of cables, and probably £lO
more for coal and engine-room expenses. Say
£52 ; besides miscellaneous expenses, wages of
clerks and other workers, which should bring the
total up to £6O. The engines were expected to
have power enough to allow an extension of the
line, but it seems they are no more than enough
for the present length. The whole is a monument
of engineering ignorance. The cable-train system
is itself a blunder except for straight lines with
fairly uniform slopes. The Ocean-street route has
three ascents, two descents, and nine curves in 2J
miles. The consequent frictional resistance is
excessive, and the wear and tear in proportion.
The adoption of the faulty grip is the least of the
blunders perpetrated.—Tangent.

Since Speight won his farthing damages
from David Syme, several hundred of the latter
gentleman’s admirers have written him enthu-
siastic letters of congratulation and enclosed a
bright, new farthing apiece, with an intimation
that they are prepared to see David through, and
a request that he would dump down the micro-
scopic coin before Speight and get rid of him for
ever. Considering that it isn’t the farthing
damages but the £40,000 costs that weigh on
Syme’s mind, this is a fine example of polished
irony. Think of the feelings of a man with a
£40,000 legal bill in one hand, and a wildly con-
gratulatory letter and a farthing in the other.
• • *
A juryman’s statement that the Speight v.
Syme verdict was the result of a compromise
makes the matter a little worse than it looked on
paper. As regards one libel—viz., that Speight
had increased the average cost of each employe
nearly 50 per cent.—eight jurors found that it was
substantially true, when it was proved to have
been a substantial untruth, founded on reckless
miscalculation. Yet the three dissentients, who
were quite clear as to the merits of this particular
issue, agreed to meet the Syme faction by allow-
ing that the error was “fair comment.” The
influence of a certain bank-prosecution can be
dimly perceived in this kindly way of regarding
false figures.
Some curiosity has been caused in certain
circles by the quashing of a charge laid against a
well-known and handsome lady of having stolen
a valuable diamond-ring. It appears that the
ring was taken about 18 months ago from a lady
lying unconscious in illness, and was the object of
an unavailing police-search on the premises of the
defendant. Recently, in the exercise of another
search-warrant for goods belonging to another
lady, what the loser claims as the missing ring
was found among a quantity of other jewellery in
a box in defendant’s house, and was taken away
by the detective and identified by the owner. An
information was sworn, but at the police court
the case was adjourned from week to week on
plea of defendant’s illness, till the week before last,
when it disappeared altogether from the charge-
sheet, no intimation of the proceedings appearing

much heavy breech-pocket loading.”
at any time in the press. There appear to be
some very strange circumstances in connection
witli this case; and many wonder how such
secrecy has been observed, and what influences
are available for suppressing reports of judicial
proceedings in the case of persons moving in
society.

Another gem from the fluent pen of Melb.
Herald’s own delightful cable-fakir. It is about
a man murdering a woman at Southampton
(Eng.):—
Something, however, occurred to cause a disagreement
between them, with the result that the man suddenly
attacked his companion with a razor, which he drew from
his pocket.
Seizing the woman by the hair, he slashed savagely at
the unfortunate creature’s throat, with such effect that
he killed her on the spot.
“ Which he drew from his pocket.” “Seizing the
woman by the hair.” Booh !

A Maoriland schoolmaster married his
pupil-teacher, who, however, went up at a later
period to pass her exam. This was all well
enough, but the master subsequently applied for
the customary State allowance of .£lO for coaching
her, and the inspector wanted to know if the
department should pay a man for “ instructing ”
his wife? Why shouldn’t it ? The fact that the
woman was married is no affair of the State’s.

A poor woman was lately brought to
Maryborough (Vic.) hospital, bleeding internally
through miscarriage. The doctor in charge
refused to admit her, as she had no “order ” and
the hospital was “not intended for such cases.”
Then a constable appealed to the Ladies’ Bene-
volent Society ; but they could do nothing, as the
woman’s character was not good—which refusal
should forever damn the benevolent ladies (with
good characters), who aren’t women. Finally, after
being carted about for four hours, the wretched
creature was taken to gaol. At the gate of nearly
every State-subsidised hospital in Australia lies a
corpse killed by “regulations.”

From proceedings of the Wanganui hos-
pital and Charitable Aid Board :
Milk. —The chairman said that in the past the Board
had been paying 3d. per quart for fresh milk, and he did
not see why, if skimmed milk was good enough for mem-
bers of the Board, they should feed the inmates of the
Jubilee Horae on fresh milk. After a brief discussion the
matter was left in abeyance.
A few inches above, the same chairman—a rich
ex-publican —figures as having sent, with a wreath,
a most affecting letter to the father of a hospital
doctor recently deceased, in which it was piously
hoped that the “ Almighty might strengthen him
to bear his sad bereavement with fortitude.” A
unanimous vote of thanks was accorded to the
kindly and considerate Bung.

Another point, not generally known, about
the N.S.W. civil service superannuation fund.
Awhile back a lady-teacher applied, on account of
ill-health, for two months’ leave, which the
authorities granted her, without pay. When,
after resuming work, she got her next cheque,
there was deducted from it the 4 per cent, super-
annuation on not only that month’s salary, but
also a like percentage for the two months previous
that she had been away on sick-leave, and for
which she had received no remuneration ! It was
explained to her that payment into the fund must
be continuous ; failing which, contributors cannot,
in any future time, claim a penny of compensation
from the wild-cat insurance department.

Wages at the new Sydney market excava-
tions —for the hire of a man, horse and cart, and

And the Sydney cabmen now are having but a poor
time. Lately said one of their number, a sober

and have brought up a large family decently, but
I have still three children at home. For the
last three years I have earned, on an average,
just £2 4s. 9d. per week, out of which I have had
to keep myself and family and two horses. lam
now old, and despair of being able to continue.
There is nothing for it but the poorhouse, as I had
to mortgage my turn-out for £25 at 40 per cent,
when the bad times came on. Look at me to-day.
I have been out since this morning at nine o’clock,
and it is now 10.30 p.m. All I have earned is two

respondent, one lady who last year was a pupil of

mum permitted. Seems a singular thing that
when a R. A. or Salon artist can only paint one or
two good pictures in a year, a N.S.W. ditto
should get through 12—all good enough to hang,
and all good enough to crowd out other artists'
work altogether.

expelled from a N.S.W. State-school cannot after-

Dear Bulletin, —“ Spagnoletti’s ” com-
miseration of uniformed nurses is three-parts
wasted, because it’s for the uniform three-parts of
them take to the calling. Woman—more emotion-
ally ostentatious than man—is credited with the
kinder heart; purring more gracefully round a
sick-bed she is assumed to be the gentler nurse.
Every man who has been both he and she-tended
knows better ; but, while this venerable gag sur-
vives, the stoniest-hearted Jezebel that ever
cursed the race will hanker after the reputation—
and the garments—of the “ministering angel.”

Another example of the dreadfully bad
luck which attends on churches and churchgoers.
Twenty-three years ago, when the church at
Koroit (Vic.) was built, some workman left a large
screw-driver lying on a rafter. It lay there un-
disturbed till a recent Sunday evening, when an
owl got into the building during service and in its
terrified flutterings knocked over the screw-driver,
which fell point-downwards on the head of Mr.
Alfred Skilbeck, and nearly killed him. Con-
sidering that the screw-driver had 23 years to fall
in, and that there were six days in the week when
it might have fallen without hurting any one, and

And Speight proves truthful, but Syme a liar,
Though Syme still wins—and Speight has lost,
Yet Speight has the honors : who pays the cost?

SPRING TIME
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
M IS r*r e
(a.e fond affair-
Spring is here, and it is sweet
Low to lie at lady’s feet,
Lingering, pouting lips to taste,
Close to press the yielding waist.
Men, beware,
lt is rare
- That she be as fond as fair.
In the half-light of the eye,
. When the shades your sight deceive,
As the western radiance dies
Eyes are looking into eyes.
Then take care
' How you fare
Lest she catch you unaware.
’Neath the wilga’s drooping shade,
Where the lover’s rest is made,
In the dim, seductive park,
Forms,are flitting after dark ;
; Then A is,
/ For a kiss,
Men would barter future bliss.
Girls, when burning whispers sound,
Bend your glances to the ground,
Answer curtly—better naught,
Half are lies, and half are sport;
Men are snakes,
h Marriage takes
All the bliss from bridal cakes.
Ah ! ’tis useless. Girls are girls,
Youth and love’s hot madness whirls
Fever-heat within the heart;
Love, and mind not after-smart;
. Kiss and play
While you may.
Death will catch you all some day.

reckoning that the congregation, even in a crowded

that the weapon might just as well have fallen

Some of the mail-boats are now as badly
rushed as are the ordinary coasters between the

into the second—which, before this innovation, was
rather more popular than the saloon. The conse-
quence is that the food is now disgraceful, the
attendance the same, and, as for the passengers,
the only places now not crowded are the bath-

A “Reform” Club is being started in
Melbourne to rope-in rampageous young Tory
patriots, at a guinea-a-head. The Reform Club
of Sydney, alas, is now dead. Its chief reason for
existence was to enjoy the opportunity of hearing
old Jack Robertson swear. When dear old Jack
died and stopped swearing—or, anyhow, when be
stopped swearing and died—the club died, too.
Those of its members whom grog had not quite
killed have been slowly dying ever since. It was
the “ booziest ” club in Australian annals.

A Sydney Woman’s Christian Temperance
unionist has made the horrific suggestion that the
union should capture the hotels by rental thereof,
and use the bars for the sale of unintoxicating
liquors. The teetotallers must first invent a new
drink with a grip in it.
Give us bluestone rum, petroleum,
Every sort of poisoned oleum,
Kerosene, sulphuric acid,
Rather than their ohillgut placid;
Give us fusel, oil of methyl,
Rather than the drinks of Bethel.

The first case of hydrophobia ever recorded
in Australia is reported from Adelaide. The
patient, who kept a hop-beer shop, having become
violent, was arrested by the police, from one of
whom he bit half a finger. Hydrophobia is about
the only old-world horror which Australia has
hitherto escaped, and now that it seems to have
really arrived, after a number of false alarms, our
civilisation may be said to be just about complete.
Let us hope that, after all, the case is only one of
acute mania.

The latest N.S.W. embezzlement presents
some unique features. The young man— he got
three years—had never drunk a glass of strong
drink, or backed a horse, or stepped on a race-
course in his life. All the loot was spent in
making home comfortable for motherland pre-
senting her with such articles as a iB6O piano. He
gave parties at home and led his friends to believe
that he was in receipt of £3OO per annum at least;
whereas, though “ financial manager” of a ware-
house, he only got 30s. a week.

The Coombe-Martin (Q.) shooting-case was
probably remarkable for the tallest lying and
deepest swearing on record. For quaint, original
oaths and fathomless, unspeakable profanity the
evidence tendered beat the record. Even the

counsel feebly apologised for the weird and lurid
epithets of his witnesses by assuring his Honor
that the objectionable vocables were only “ terms

Victorian general elections have been
robbed of one of their most interesting features,
viz. —tomatoes. This vegetable ripens (and decays)
about Feb. or March, and was most useful for
election-purposes in days gone by. Now that the
election date, has been changed to Sept, voters
have, in their 1 Armouries, nothing but the time-
honored egg* with an occasional packet of flour
thrown in, The tomato’s place is, indeed, hard

gratifying splash which is entirely absent from

The effects of the explosion of an air-
eylinder at the sewage works, Port Melbourne,
one day last week, were peculiar. The men work-
ing in the shaft where the explosion took place
were carried nearly to the surface by the rush of
air, and, as the power subsided, were gently
lowered again, each revolving on his own axis like
a catherine-wheel, and striking the bottom without
sustaining a cent’s worth of damages. One of the
miners told a Bulletin man that the sensation
was rather pleasant, and inferred that as a mar-
ried man he hoped never to be blown up with
worse effect.

Dear Bulletin, — Be Wicked. Woman
books, the neo-erotic fiction’s complacent assump-
tion that it has anything new to say only proves
that the most risquee of women doesn’t know her
world-alphabet yet. These throwers of would-be
sexual bombs have sprung no surprise upon any-
body who remembers that woman’s finest qualities
are only possible, after all, upon an adequate basis
of she-animal. This remorseless exploitation of
the “young person’s” esoteric feelings is of no
value to anybody but the women whose only
literary capital is the less savoury—-or too savoury

THE LAW OF SELF-PRESERVATION.
The Law is very old, and not
The kind of person girls can wheedle ;
A spouse at home the Law has got—
A bad look-out for Martha Needle.
Fair Martha’s husband on the “ shelf ”
Reminds the Law to mind himself;
No pity for the pouting sinner
Hath he who trusts his daily life
Into the keeping of a wife,
And drinks her coffee after dinner.
The Law’s a Man, just bear in mind,
His mother’s son and not her daughter,
And hence the Law is disinclined
To sympathise with husband-slaughter—
No crime could be more black and base ;
But Justice, in the Needle case,
A weight of hidden meaning carries.
The Law, by breaking Martha’s neck,
Is putting—well, a little check
Upon the lady whom he marries.

The Bulletin is still ignorant of the authorship of “ Who
cares for nothing alone is free,” but it appears to be an
American set of verses. (2) Idea relinquished. (3) It is
best for all Australian authors to publish in London,
where Pavenc has made a great success with his “Tales
of the Austral Tropics,” and where Becke will also sc< re
with “Reef and Palm.” Any author who pul fishes in
Australia does himself a cruel and irreparable injustice.
The Australian public w'on’t buy a book, however good,
published in Australia; but they will buy the veriest
rubbish on the strength of London notices. A. J.
Comyns: The Press has no more libel-privileges than the
man at the street-corner, and, when it is sane, doesn’t
ask for any .. C. M‘J.: Sydney Sunday Times may know-
all about medicine, but it’s evidently no chemist. Apropos
the new remedy for snakebite, it speaks of chloride < f
lime as “washing-soda.” Chloride of lime isn’t washing-
soda —it is simply the bleaohing-powder of commerce.
Washing-soda, on the other hand, is crystallised carbonate
of soda. There is as much difference between chloride < f
lime and carbonate of soda as between chalk and cheese
A. Horton: The Australian term “bail-up” is derived
from bailing-up as applied to cows. When a man is
“ bailed-up ” bv bushrangers he is to be milked of 1 i <
money. The American “hold-up,” similarly used, has
quite another origin. It means “ hold up your hands,"
so that you can’t draw a hip-pocket revolver.
The Present Season.
Many persons may not be aware that the season
now upon us, with all its wealth of youthful ver-
dure and floral embellishment, commonly known
as “ beautiful Spring,” has its perils as well as its
delights. Experience reveals the disquieting fact
that the human system is subject to vicissi-
tudes brought about by climatic influences
peculiar to Spring-tide. While nature is assum-
ing her most attractive features, and delighting
the senses, there are opposing influences at work
which frequently, in a secret and insidious way,
go far to counteract the joyous sensations n still-
ing from the renewed beauties of the vernal re-
vival. Too often the impaired action of some
vital organ, probably the kidneys, produces a
vitiated condition of the blood, attended by boils
and abscesses, and many painful symptoms, which
render it impossible to enjoy life. The liver, al o,
if not actually congested, becomes sluggish and
inactive, causing a number of other disagreeable
and dangerous complications owing to the in-
corporation of bile with the blood.
Now is the time when active measures should be
taken to remove these troublesome indications.
The most effectual agent hitherto discovered for
this purpose is undoubtedly Warner’s Safe Cure,
which, aided.by a judicious use of Warner’s Safe
Pills, has established itself as the most successfu ,
and, in fact, the only reliable antidote to all ir-
regularities connected with the kidneys and liver,
affections of the urinary organs, and an impure
condition of the blood.
The following testimonial from a well-known
lady-philanthropist will well illustrate the power
and value of Warner’s Safe Cure; “Eirene,”
Ohatsworth-road, Prahran, near Melbourne, Vic-
toria, 20th April, 1894. —I can speak of Warner’s
Safe Cure in the very highest terms, for I believe
I should not now be living save for its use. I
speak of it and recommend it to all my friends,
and I am very sure a patient and continuous t s •
would in many cases have saved life. I was dy n t
from Bright’s Disease, brought on by the shock of
operations for tumor, and was so ill when I began
it a nurse had to lift and turn me in bed. I had
been bed-ridden for many months from acute
pains in my limbs; one knee was so contracted
from agony of pain I could not stand at all. I
was suffering from gravel and many complications,
and fully thought I was dying when I dismissed
all doctors and began the Safe Cure in April,
1887. I am perfectly well now, and have not
needed to use any for several years.—(Signed)

My Dear Moorabinda—
“Exhibition Hall” (the old noisy York-street
skating-rink, where the Art show was staged this
year) had about as many people as you could
scatter with one flourish of a pepper-caster the
other eve, when Mr. Nicholas Shiels rose among
the lovely frames and delivered a technical lecture
upon “ Etching.” To a rank outsider, Mr. Shiels*
explanations wanted explaining. The only thing
I seized in a sea of darksome allusions to “copper
biting ” and “dry point” was when Mr. S. con-
fessed that the charm of etching was its uncer-
tainty, which is, no doubt, why the French make
a feminine noun of it. Comic relief (from a
gallery point of view) was given to the proceedings
by the appearance of an individual with three
pink roses in his coat, who had once been a presi-
dent of the Society, and who rose to discuss the
lecture in a wild and rambling speech, whereat
several men and women laughed, but to me the
spectacle seemed hardly a mirthful circumstance.
By the way, the artists present revenged them-
selves upon the “ evening-dress ” aspect of things
at the “ smoke-oh ” by sporting coats of many
colors, and a general air as if the Art Society had
run to seed was noticeable all round. The fuzzy-
wuzzy coiffure of a he-artist on my near side, for
example, looked as if he had held a butting-match
with a rabbit-proof fence before coming out. Mr.
Bloxsome presided in a Carnot necktie and a dis-
tinctly judicial manner. If I ever had to explain
myself to the Art Society’s brand-new president,
I am sure I should say “ Your Worship.”
A fete in aid of some hungry church or other
came off at Toxteth Park the other day, under
active vice-regal patronage, Lady Duff doing the
show from door to door, which was all the vice-
regal party did do, for not even a penny pin-
cushion found its way to Government House.
Her Excellency viewed the cobbled cosies and the
puckered slippers with every mark of approbation,
but came out of the fiery ordeal quite purse-whole.
To go to a “sale of gifts ” without your purse is
equivalent to going to a dinner-party without
your teeth.
When charity dances cease, philanthropiojfolk
raise the wind with bazaars. The fair in aid of
Auburn hospital, which runs for a week from to-
day (Saturday), is to be perfectly stage-managed.
Sydney Town Hall is the place of action; the
Acting-Governoress is president over the 16 stalls,
the banditti are to be in nurses’ uniform, and I
am told that the disputed Geneva cross which
gives Dr. Vandeleur Kelly so much trouble won’t
be allowed to appear even on the bath-buns.
It is to be hoped that when the Hospitals ball
comes off in ’95, a little more consideration will
be given to the naming of the rendezvous. It is
occasionally possible to be a little too apropos. A
maiden was making dance-engagements at the
ball hereinbefore alluded to, and when he had
signed the contract there came the usual, “And
where shall I find you?” “ Oh, this is my haunt,”
said the maiden, glancing upwards at the sign,
"The Benevolent Asylum !”
Sydney Philharmonic Society finished up their
festival on Saturday evening with “The Messiah.”
Madame Sapio, Belle Cole, Mr. W. Walshe and
Magrath, were the soloists; the chorus and
orchestra of the society went well and strong
throughout, and Wiegand made thrilling, if spas-
modic, appearances at the organ. Signor Hazon
conducted. People who come under the beat of
bis baton say the magnetic maestro has a most
unexpected way of beating time, and that strange
vocalists obey him with difficulty. Talking of
the instrumental part of the show, I would like to
tell that young lady in a white gown and a celes-
tial nose, who played the fiddle immediately
behind leader Allpress, that no less an authority
than the gifted Madame Urso was quite taken
with her bowing.
Madame Sapio (in pale-blue brocade with pink
rosebuds) certainly took the vocal palm. Madame
Belle Cole, in black with a point-lace tucker, was
by no means so successful. The contralto’s ren-
dering of “ He was Despised ” seemed to me as
grotesquely mournful as a dingo howling in the
wilderness. Mr. Walshe took the tenor part on
very short notice. I like Mr. Walshe in oratorio.
His vocal manner is so stately that you never
imagine for one moment that he is trying to wink
at a pretty little angel.
Charles Magrath was in resonant voice for the
growling numbers. He is very over-aweing in
oratorio, and always looks the part. As Elijah
he was almost a character-study, barring the omis-
sion of the prophet’s historical bald-head, and his
awful scowl in the “ Messiah ” suggested that he
was endeavoring to impersonate the incensed
deity. When the chorus shouted that unto them
a “son had been born,” he no doubt took quite a
personal interest in the matter, for precisely the
same thing has just happened (in England) to Mr.
Magrath. Some of the sacred remarks of the
chorus aforesaid were weirdly split up to fit the
music, it seemed to me. For example, sopranos,
contraltos, tenors and basses separately reiterated
“ All we like sheep ” until it really almost sounded
like an ad. for Australian mutton.
A pleasant little ceremony occurred in the in-
terval, when Mayor Manning, in a flowery speech,
presented the badge of the P.S. to Camilla Urso,
Sapio, and Belle Cole. I thought the presentation
far more effective than the eleventh-hour handing
over to Lady Halß, at the Redfern Railway
Station, of a silver lyre-bird with a long, unman-
ageable tail. This work of art, you remember,
was got “on tick ” from a local handicraftsman,
who was only prevented with the greatest diffi-
culty from presenting his little bill to Norman-
herself.
The Town Hall fairly bulged with people,
topped off by Gov. Duff in white kid gloves, and
with Lady Duff in rainbow silk, a daughter or
two and Mr. Pennyman in his suite. General and
Mrs. Hutton, Mr. James Fairfax and Mayor and
Mayoress Manning scintillated in the front
row of patronage; and Madame Urso, in a gown
smothered in black jet, and squired by Benno
Scherek, who had a miniature skull for bouton-
niere, also had her feet on the sacred vice-regal
carpet.
Apropos of patronage parties. The unrepre-
sentative wife of a representative man must suffer'
violent agonies when hubby trots out after it’s all
oyer with Lady Snooks hanging affectionately on
his arm, and leaving his lawful wife to show her-
self to her carriage. When sex-equality is firmly
established there will have to be an escort pro-
vided for Lady Oracle when Sir Oracle’s strong
left arm is booked to another lady for the evening.
I didn’t detect much novelty amongst the
choristeresses on the platform. One fair ’cellist
in a white gown and a scarlet four-cornered
waist-belt could have gone to any bal masqud
as the ace of diamonds; and one of the soprani
rather reversed the usual order of things by
glaring at the audience through flashing opera-
glasses. That wouldn’t be a bad idea for the
chorus of the next Gaiety Co.
Do you know that there is a language attached
to the way a well-known, silvery-haired musician
of Melbourne wears his eye glass string ? When
it hangs straight down his blushing cheek he is
“quiet to handle,” as the horse-dealers say, and
could be trusted to chaperone Venus her-very-self.
When a subdued feeling of friskiness comes o’er
him, the cord is stuck out of harm’s way behind
the waxed portion of his mustivey ; and when he
is particularly dangerous he tucks the string out
of the road behind his right ear.
Maidens whose pet Johnnies look at life through
window-panes will please accept this intimation.
For, though these profoundly interesting signs are
only visible on one individual, they may be the
key-note to the moral slant of all eye-glassed
Johnnydom, for aught I know. Somebody should
write a piece on the language of eye-glass strings.
It js certain that one of these serviceable threads
in juxtaposition with Vincent’s moustache would
quite spoil the osculations for Rosette.
While talking of music I had fully meant to say
that there is a rumour of a return to mournful
Gregorian chantings (like the groans of the
wounded in the battle of Prague) by the R.C.
authorities in Australia, acting under Papal
orders. But fancy the Romish services without
the standard masses which give good-natured
operatic artistes (Sapio sang like an angel in St.
Patrick’s, Sydney, last Sunday) the chance to
bring down the house on the seventh day !
They tell me that a league of ungallant Sydney
youths has formulated a dark plot to banish the
women from the dummies of the King-st. cable-
tram, by means of the very rankest brands of
tobacco. It is most amusing to see how pertina-
ciously woman does stick to the dummy. She
evidently intends to ride in front, there and else-
where, every time.
The same moral difference that distinguishes, or
used to distinguish, the Melbourne from the Syd-
ney hansom cab also extends to the cable-trams of
the two cities. In Melbourne, as the tram
dummies were monopolised (like the hansoms)
from the start by golden-haired ladies with
elaborately-clocked stockings, they are considered,
even to this day, a more or less frisky mode of
transit for the daughters of Eve. But in Sydney,
the Darling Pointer steps off the dummy in the
very core of King-street with an absolutely uncon-
scious air, or goes flying down hill (four of her
make a fashionable figurehead on the little cable-
gripper) with all the fluttering appearance of
Mary Ann on a merry-go-round.
“Ma Mie Rosette” continues to impress its
virtuous lesson at Sydney Lyceum. May
Pollard’s legs, clad in tights the plaintive hue of
the lean part of boiled pork, are picturesque
enough to support the opera single-handed, so to
speak. Marietta Nash, who accentuates her like-
ness to a Dutch doll by painting her cheeks bright
red, is another pleasing item; and Lauri’s legs
twinkle all over the show. I think nature in-
tended Mr. Lauri for a coryphee—he never seems
at his best unless he is gyrating in a cutty-sark.
Howard Vernon reminded me of a mixture of
Amelia’s unfortunate young man and “Hop’s”
idea of a social-purity official. By the way, people
notice that Tapley is allowed more scope when he
frantically hugs his dear Rosette than ever Nellie
S. vouchsafed to the fascinating Ryley. Is it done
to make little Mrs. T. sit gnashing her bridal
teeth in the darkness of the auditorium ?
Miss Chirnside (Mrs. Everard Browne) has
given her friends several surprises even in the
short interval since her disclosure that she did not
go to Molesworth Greene’s place for her honey-
moon, as arranged. The last is the postpone-
ment of her trip to England, on which she and
her husband were to start on Saturday.
A sign of the times is that a lady, once rich and
extremely well-known in society, last week opened
a pretty little tea-shop in Hunter-street. She
hopes to obtain the patronage of her friends,
by whom she has been accorded an encouraging
send-off. Which makes two “ society ” tea-shops
in Hunter-street.
Three “dissenting” clergymen visited Man-
darin Tart’s restaurant recently and ate to the
tune of 18d. each. On being presented with the
usual cash-desk docket each refused to accept on
the ground that they understood that “ Mr. Tart”
always invited clergymen to “partake.”
Hilda Spong, I hear, is going in bald-headed for
her “art,” and no shirk. She applied for an
order to do the lunatic-asylums the other day to
study the gibberings therein, and one of her recent
outings was a trip to the Sydney Zoo to hear a
hyena laugh ! Her next part ought to be per-
fectly lively if she works all these tips in !
What a number of shelfy-looking women on the
Block are now wearing grey with pink fal-de-rals!
A worse chromatic choice, under the circum-
stances, would be impossible. I thought every
woman knew that as white is the uniform of the
debutante, so pink-and-grey is the trade-mark of
an old maid ? Any unappreciated maiden of
debateable juvenility who goes abroad in the
festive colors of a rosy cockatoo might just as well
add beaded mittens and a poodle on a ribbon to
her walking-costume. When her dressmaker sug-
gests pink and grey—a combination supposed to
lighten faded complexions and give an air of early
spring to the last rose of summer, so to speak—
the wisest thing a woman can do is to join the
she-Suffrage League at once and make a sudden
discovery of the worthlessness of Man.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Southern racing-boom commences on Satur-
day at Caulfield. Local interest in the game which, one
time, provided Melbourne with six solid weeks of madness
would have been fainter this year than last but for a
threatened scooping of the pool by Sydney invaders. So
many “ morals ” are said to be coming, if they haven’t
already arrived, from beyond the Murray, that Victoria
shows a disposition to barrack for its own side, and is
more than usually eager to skin the stranger within its
gates. Guineas Day, at Caulfield, however, is often
very bad for everybody except the “books." For one
thing, a deluge is apt to occur about the middle
of October, and then the proverbial rank-outsider
comes sludging first past the post amidst the shouts of
damp Israelites. The Caulfield course, too, seems to
favour surprises, by giving moderate old animals an undue
pull over the crack heavy-weights. And there are pre-
meditated surprises sprung upon the public by cunning
asses who can’t find it in their hearts to win a race on the
first day of a meeting, but must needs try to ‘‘take the
measure ” of something that is merely having an idiotic
“ liker ” at something else.
The Caul field Stakes may supply a rough out-
line idea as to which horses are likely to distinguish them-
selves presently. Patron, Paris, Brockleigh, Carnage,
Fortunatus, Capstan, Isaac, Ruenalf, Nobleman, Tarcoola,
Malvolio, Loyalty, and others, are entered for this nine-
furlong race, and if many of them toe the mark the
gallop will be worth looking at, anyway. Should Dream-
land show up for the Guineas, a red-hot favorite for the
V.R.O. Derby will probably eventuate.
The two Ballarat stables represented by Dream-
land in the Derby and Capstan in the Caulfield Cup, are
said to have some more good ones behind them. In other
quarters, Steadfast, Fortunatus, Bruin, Tullamore and
Straightflre are talked about by people who ought to
know. Whether the local animals will hold their own
against the Sydney-Newcastle contingent remains to be
seen.
• • • •
Dreamland is re-introduced into the Derby
betting, and there is the usual talk of a large stable
commission. Is it likely that Scobie would adyise his
owners to back him while, barring one Yorkshire gallop,
he is utterly in the dark as to the colt’s capabilities 7 A
line has yet to be obtained through Shotbolt’s and others’
running at Caulfield. This flash in the pan may be
due to the tactics of the “artless bookie.’* Remember
Autonomy two seasons ago ! Was he not reported as
backed for tons by the stable, and yet Camoola repre-
sented them—and won ?
* * * •
Capstan again is reported to have cleaned out
all Alec. Taylor’s lot, and is consequently backed pretty
freely for Caulfield Cup. If, during the Melb. month, a
good winner is to be sprung from Ballarat district it may,
after all, be Shofbolt.
♦ ♦ • e
Toorak Handicap looks, on paper, a certainty
for Eumarrah. If upset, ’twill be by Parramatta—being
fit at present.
• * * •
Moorite keeps well, and Caulfield Guineas to-day
(Sat.) looks a gift for him, though he can be made much
better by Derby day-d la Strathmore, he may win the
double.
• • • *
The field for the Caulfield, alias the Graveyard,
Stakes will doubtless contain the usual percentage of
candidates labelled N.O.J. Ruenalf (Flaneur spelt back-
wards, by the way)should win, but in his absence Forward
or Euroka will about do the trick.
• * * •
Good accounts are to hand of Gaillardia, Bruin
and The Captain, and the winner of the Caulfield Cup
will probably spring from this trio.
* ♦ ♦ •
Sternchaser may run well, but he will be handier
in the Melb. Cup, where, on his best behavior, he should
be upsides with the winner. We have not seen the best
of this horse yet, and it must be remembered that his
owner is in luck—which is a great factor in racing.
• ♦ ♦ •
Launceston ought to have a chance for Caulfield
Cup. Last season, with 7st. 121 h., he ran second to Lady
Trenton (6st. 121 b.) in A.J.C. Handicap, 1J mile, in 2.37 J
—a good go. Now he has the same weight over the same
distance, and she has to give him 101 b., so that he meets
her on 241 b. better terms than he did last year. Then,
again, he ran third to Donation (to whom he conceded
61b.) in the V.R.O. Handicap in the fastest time on record.
* • • *
Gundaoai Times “After Chesterman had so
brilliantly won Randwick Plate, a lady walked up and
kissed the son of Chester on the nose. Chesterman did
not resent the liberty, but seemed to appreciate it." Poor
“ Augur ’’ used to say the Chesters all had gross appetites.
• • • *
The requisition for another Sydney handicapper
is pretty influential, but might have been a good deal
more so. Then it is made to look big by the inclusion of
all connected with certain stables.
• • • *
Gov. Glasgow (M.L.), whose ancestor raced and
bred horses, among them Musket, assented to the Gaming
Bill rather sooner than was expected, and tote shop-
proprietors and walking totes are looking out for another
mode of living. £2O or three months (without hard) will
be the fate of not only’ the tote-odds-layer but the backer,
and the Bench may fine them the £2O and send them to
gaol as well.
* * * •
Whakawatea was about the fastest two-year-old
Maoriland ever produced, Carbine and Maxim thrown in,
but he was shipped and dumped about to race-meetings
all over the islands and spoilt. It was only the late Wally
Clifford’s riding on Stepniak that beat him in the Welcome
Stakes at Christchurch. However, a season or so after-
wards he beat Stead’s horse in a mile and a-quarter race
at Wellington. People this side think him only a sprinter.
♦ ♦ ♦ •
After all, Tom Corrigan’s widow has nothing.

With the revival in Australian pedestrianism
comes a discussion as to who is really champion. Samuels,
the Q. aboriginal, has sadly deteriorated, and, beyond a
doubt, M'Qarrigal is not nearly so fast as when, almost
six years ago, he won the Botany Gold Cup and a big
Carrington Handicap in the same week. Taking late
public form as a guide, there is no doubt that the cham-
pion sprinter is Larry Marsh, the aboriginal from the
Clartnoe River, N.S.W. (whose portrait, from a photo, by
Edsn, of Sydney, is printed in this week's Bullbtin). He
la 2S years old, 6ft. Sin. high, and in running costume
weighs about 9 stone, but possesses the thews and sinew*
of a 12st. man, devoid of lumber. In shape, he is tha
beau ideal of a sprinter, and his style is easy and graceful
In intelligence, he is far above most of the aboriginal
runners seen in Sydney, and, living more steadily, should
soon eclipse his former performances. His brother Jack
Marsh, lately showed in Victoria that he is little below
Larry in pace, and, being two years younger and some,
what bigger, may yet equal, if not surpass, his elder
brother as a sprinter.
• • • •
Though Larry Marsh, the aboriginal, is now
generally recognised as Australia’s champion runner yet
many think that at any distance between 120 and 44#
yards he is not equal to “Wally” Williams, the well-
known Botany and Carrington performer. Nearly eight
years ago, the writer asked Hutchens, the English cham-
pion, his opinion of the Australian runners. The “ Put.
ney Pet” replied that, leaving aside the aboriginal, for
whom no laws held, the native-born were more adapted for
medium-distance running than sprinting. A sprinter not
only had to get fit, but keep on year after year so as to
develope muscle and strength. Robust men, not liable to
get overtrained, were the best, and Hutchens pointed
out how the best performers at Sheffield were compara-
lively old men. He also instanced the American Myers
who, while unapproached at medium distances, was never
equal to the first-class amateurs at sprinting. Prom his
length of stride and spare physique, the future Aus-
tralian should beat the world at races from a quarter to a
mile. Hutchens, however, said one young runner was of
the robust stamp required for Sheffield sprinting. This
was “Wally” Williams, then comparatively a novice.
Time has verified the English champion’s opinion in one
particular. The strong and shapely Williams soon got to
the top of the tree, and was among the best half-dozen
ever seen at Carrington or Botany. And he alone seems
to have retained his old form. Walter H. Williams was
born at Dubbo, N.S.W., 27 years ago. He stands 5 feet
9| inches, and, in running costume and properly fit, weighs
list. 41b. He has got into twenty finals.

Evangelist M‘Neil’s strong plank in Adelaide
was the accursed totalisator which he denounced in the
name of the Lord as an abomination. Now, brothers
M‘Neil and Burke made £122 3s. 9d. net profit on their
one week’s Adelaide show, and if they had done as tha
totalisator authorities do they would have publicly turned
over the “ fraction," £22 3s. 9d., to the charities. How-
ever, being very good men indeed, perhaps they turned it
over privately.
• • • »
The Council of Churches, sitting at Melbourne
the other day, announced that it recognised that the spirit
of gambling was a national evil, and that immediate steps
should be taken for the suppression of the evil. There-
fore, the Council deliberately determined that sermons
shodld be preached against “ this great danger to the
public and religious life of the people.” This is rough on
the bookies—just before the Cup, tool Seriously, the
belief of the average parson in the efficacy of sermons is a
stupendous thing.
* • • •
Maoriland’s new gaming law not only prevents
actions for racing stakes, etc., being tried in a court of
law, but also money won or said to have been won by any
person at athletic sports or other games or exercises!

There’s not a single Musket racing in Maoriland
now. All are at the stud.

Dear Bulletin, —“There is nothing new under
the sun." See Bailt’s Maqazinr about Sept.—Deo.,
'93, where (I think in “ Our Van ") the writer mentions
casually that at some European Continental race-meeting
the horses were started much in the same way as that
sought for now in the Southern Australias— i.e., by a
starting-machine. 1 have lost the number of Bailt’s, but
some of your sporting readers may think it worth looking
up.— John Scott. Blackall, Q., 29/9/’94.

The very little inventive genius hitherto dis-
played by young Australia is devoted to discovering a
new style of starting-machine.

John L. Sullivan, who has finally quitted the
boxing boards for the stage, now weighs 21 stone.
• * * *
A young Tasmanian, who fancies himself with
his hands, was in Sydney during the great J. L. Sullivan’s
visit and looked him up at his hotel, introducing himself
as an admirer and humble imitator. After, preliminaries,
the young worshipper invited the illustrious one and Ash-
ton to take a drink. Each accepted, and with a wink to
the presiding Hebe, said he would have “the same as
usual.” Which proved to be a large bottle of fizz apiece.
The adoring one took shandygaff himself and paid without
a wink, but reflected on the penalties attached to knowing
the salt of the earth.

A Vie. member of the last Australian Eleven
(not the oldest) has been provided with a billet in a Melt,
mercantile house in consideration of playing with the big
club. The same good fairy who did this got a Ballarat
carpenter into a bank as a clerk so that he should play
football with his club.

“ Billy ” War brick, known in Maoriland,
Queensland, and N.S.W.—and in Britain-asa Rugbeian,
has returned to his trade of boat-building, having opein d
a shed in Lavender Bay, Sydney. Sweets of football fame
are short-lived, although the half-caste Maori led the
Bananalanders as late as this year at Sydney Association
Ground,

Why the totalisator should supersede Nebuchad-
nezzar Solomons, the bookmaker, in every Australian
province;—
1. Because the tote lays the highest odds.
2. Because it never climbs over the nearest fence when
the time comes to pay out.
3. Because it never needs to lay short odds so as to buy
a diamond pin and a 36-carat watch and chain.
4. Because the tote is indifferent as to the ultimate
winner, and never needs to dose up the favorite in the
interests of the “bag.”
5. Because the machine doesn’t own and run racehorses
6. Because the percentage profits go to the clubs and,
through increased stakes, hack to the public.
7. Because wherever it has been tried the machine has
purified racing and protected the legitimate owner.
8. Because it has led to the extinction of the turf
middleman, the “bookie,” and diverted hundreds of
pounds from his pocket to the charities by handing its
fractions to benevolent institutions.

Molly Darling, who got home in a race at
Timaru (M.L.), the other day, went out unbacked on the
tote, and investors got their money back, less 10 per cent.
The owner had wired money to the tote-shops in other
parts, and as the machine paid nothing some of them
refused to pay. However, as they were not supposed to
do “ tote ” business, and as the money was sent them to
“ put on,” and “ nix ” was put on, but “put in” their
pockets, they have to pay the £l5 limit and say nothing.
But how wild the owner was on finding he had been too
clever, and that if he had put £1 on his mare on the
course he would have scooped the lot!
• * * •
Hawkes Bay (M.L.) spring meeting invariably
furnishes an undeniable tip for N.Z. Cup, but North
Atlantic (Nordenfeldt —Atlantis), who won the big handi-
cap, and Form 6 (Nordenfeldt Formo), winner of the
guineas, are not in the big Christchurch event. M.L.
breeders should never have allowed Hordern to buy Nor-
denfeldt for the sake of 5600gns.

Coolgardie is not the sole attraction for
Easterners. Some unsavoury layers of odds have just
gone over to Westralia to lay the “ doubles ” on the
Melbourne Cup. They have not a fiver between them,
but that won’t matter, as their natural brass will work the
oracle. After fixing up a tidy book (no tick) they must,
of course, “ run over to see the Cup, you know.” But
the lambs will see them no more.

Three favorites only have won the Melb. Cup
in over 30 years. Therefore, the odds are 10 to 1 v. the

Re the Blaokham-Tooher affair. If interpro-
vinciai cricket is to cease on account of nasty remarks
made in the chagrin of defeat, it should have come to an
end long ago. So far as umpire Tooher is concerned, he
personally does not care what Blackham or anyone else
may say about his umpiring, as his cricket reputation
stands too high to be affected by a hasty remark. Sydney
cricketers should not crow too loudly over the affair
either, as many a time have they returned with
ths self-same cry of “ defeated by umpiresand Tommy

Few readers of “A Queenslander s Travel-
Notes,” by A. G. Stephens, will endorse the
author’s application to himself of Matthew
Arnold’s scoff at the traveller-in-vain, for, in this
account of a trip to Europe vid the States and
Canada, Mr. Stephens has supplemented a sharp
eye and a sinewy judgment with a live pen. it
he has “ trotted ” his globe, there are no signs of
the incidental “joggling” about this easy chronicle
of impressions reproduced with a humor that
“goes of itself.” Mr, Stephens can say chunky
things in a feathery way, and expresses himself,
when he chooses, with an epigrammatic felicity
which may fairly condone his unholy affection tor
the pun that walketh in darkness. The philosophy
of the missionary-question, for instance, could
hardly be more neatly nutshelled than in the
observation—touching the Chinaman that At
centuries of heredity can’t be eradicated m the
twinkle of a missionary’s eye!” The Scottish
idiosyncrasy, too, is shot flying with the assertion
that Sandy alone succeeds in serving God ana
Mammon ! The book, in short, abounds with
shrewd criticism —has a fair share of grotesquenes
and “good-’uns”—and may be kodaked as dis-
tinctly re-readable.

As an indication of the belief in the
revival of prosperity in N.S. Wales, it may be
noted that the well-known ophthalmic opticians,
Messrs. Wood, who have been established in
Liverpool for over 70 years, and in Melbourne for
20, and whose reputation for the scientific testing
of eyesight is world-wide, have opened an estab-
lishment at 299 George-street, Sydney, with the
intention of making that city the centre of their
Australian operations. Mr. W. Wood, who was
originally connected with their Lord-st._ house,
but who has more recently been located in Mel-
bourne, is charged with the superintendence of
the new establishment.

Editor Bulletin,— “ Not Much ” substi-
tutes fiction for fact. My statement was that
when a man or a community pays interest nothing
is received in exchange, which is a simple fact.
“Not Much” thinks we need not trouble about
our national debts. By and bye we shall be in
the position of the man who sold everything at &
loss and was only able to make a living by the
multiplicity of his transactions. This is mere
fiction I prefer to stick to the facts as indicated
on page 18 of The Bulletin ,of Sept. 22, which
are that the national debts of the world have
increased nearly five-fold in the last half century,
and we know that the private indebtedness has
also enormously increased. “Not Much evi-
dently thinks that by constant borrowing we can
all become rich enough to do without work if only
somebody else will provide the income for us. ihe
cow and calf story touches quite another ques-
tion. As to whether the average individual or
the average nation is such a fool as to give some-
thing for nothing, I am sorry to say each is.-

Wool and Produce Reports.
M'Burnby, Wallis & Co., report'The weekly wool
auctions opened on Monday to a Urge attendance of
buyers representing all the manufacturing centres of the
world. The market is in a state of uncertainty, and
bidding was of a very half-hearted character. Judging
by sales made, prices are considerably lower than last
season, but we have hopes they may harden somewhat as
the sales progress. We would again impress upon owners
the great importance of submitting to the auctioneer s
advice. He is on the spot and has the best knowledge of
current values and when to meet the market. Excessive
reserves spoil the sale of a clip.

The late Ross Cox, Melb. journalist, was
the son of a Dublin clergyman, and reached Aus-
tralia as scripture-reader on a convict-ship, a post
ne got by influence for, like most parsons’ sons, he
Knew about as much of theology as he did of gold-
ligging. Luckily, there were but two of his own
alleged faith on board and neither of them
‘bigoted,” so he got through until the boat
reached Hobart. There, he was sent for by the
Bishop, who had been informed that young
Cox wished for ordination. “ What is your
detailed arrangement of the 39 articles ?” asked
chat dignitary. “Dunno,” replied Ross; and he
repeated the answer to a dozen similar questions.
“ My young friend,’’said the Bishop at last, “I
lon’t know how you obtained your appointment,
out you certainly cannot be ordained here.” So
Ross made for the Vic. goldfields, and ultimately
drifted into journalism. He was the author of
several circumstantial hoaxes, one of which was a
description of a telegraphic tasting-machine, with
a.ll the prominent politicians’and professors’names
used with a liberty that made the public swallow
the article as solemn fact. At another time he
described how the Shah bought two infant slaves,
male and female, and, like the historic Irishman
in the gondola yarn, let “nature take its course,”
watching developments meanwhile. The cool
audacity with which names were used, and the
apparent technical and scientific knowledge of the
writer, made Cox’s hoaxes go down with nine-
tenths of nevvspaper readers, most of whom pro-
bably believe in them to the present day.
I am Tired!
Sufferers from indigestion and liver complaint are
subject to a continued feeling of drowsiness,
headache, tired aching- limbs, and a general
inclination to languor. These symptoms are due
primarily to a deficient secretion of bile, the
natural cathartic of the liver, which, when secreted
in insufficient quantities, permits the coarse and
fibrous particles of the food and other waste and
poisonous matter from all parts of the system to
become impacted in the duodenum and lower
intestines, creating a very dangerous condition
which requires instant and proper treatment.
An experience of five years with Clements Tonic
has proved, this remedy a specific for such com-
plaints, and its universal success has resulted in
thousands of imitations being forced on the
market; not because they possess any therapeutic
value, for they are purely speculative ventures.
Sufferers who desire to get relief must insist on
having Clements Tonic. It acts scientifically, has
proved its efficacy in thousands of cases as in
that of Mr. W. S. H. Dunlop, Berry, N.S.W.,
who writes on April 7th, 1893 About five or six
weeks ago I got a stroke of the sun which ran
through me from the crown of my head to my
foot. I was completely shook and broken up ;
one bottle of your Clements Tonic completely
cured me, and I am as strong as ever, in fact,
better than I was before. I have also used
Clements Tonic for influenza. About eighteen
months ago I had three attacks of that disease,
and after all other remedies failed, Clements Tonic
cured me, and I consider it has done all you profess
it to do. If you think the above will benefit others,
you are at liberty to use it.—Yours faithfully,
W. S. H. Dunlop, Berry, N.S.W.
Dear Bulletin, — He a par in “ Wild Oat”
column of 25tli Aug. A friend writing from out
back sends me this to show you how the system is
worked : “Some fellow in Sydney has been
advertising that he had large sums to lend cheap
on good security. Some farmers here thinking it
a good chance, wrote to him ; in consequence of
this the advertiser’s representative came up to
personally interview them. The first thing he
required was an examination fee of so much per
cent, on the amount to be borrowed; this, of
course, had to be paid down. He then examined
the farmers’ proposed securities and reported to
head-quarters, and, as you may imagine, the
report was unfavorable. A great number of
people about here fell in, one for .£2O, one for .£lO,
one for £lO, one for .£6; and others, making a total
of nearly <£2)o, were bitten. One farmer offered
the representative a bonus if he negotiated a loan
for him, but refused to pay an examination fee.
Needless to say, he heard no more of his applica-
tion.” —Yours, &c., A.G.R.
Curiously enough, the Oarruthers Land
Bill proposes to prohibit the taking up of N.S. VV.
“homestead selections” or “settlement leases”
by any “person who is not a natural-born or
naturalised subject of Her Majesty.” Under
such a law, a Hindoo or a Hongkongee would be
able to become a homestead selector, while a
German, Danish, Swedish, &c., newcomer—who
might have been all his days an agriculturist, and
who is generally a settler to be desired—would be
debarred, until he first qualified for naturalisation
by five years’ residence within the province. It
should be sufficient to limit the prohibition of
selection to aliens against whom it has been
already expedient to pass restrictive legislation,
adding, however, to the isolated Chinee, the
Asiatic, the Papuan, the Polynesian, and the
general variety of Hackman. Further, it is high
time that a more liberal naturalisation law was
passed in N.S.W. Only, let the above-indicated
anti-alien legislation be clearly defined and strin-
gently administered as a first precaution.
The proprietors of “Morocco Bound’’
have had a series of extraordinary misadventures
ever since they bought the piece in London. Dick
Kenna, one of them, missed the boat from London,
had to rush down to Brindisi, take ship to Port
Said, and just managed tocatch his own vessel there.
On arrival in Sydney he bought a bull-dog, and
took him up home to Bathurst in order to have him
ready for the first night. He was an inoffensive
dog and was left in custody of a lady relative of
the proprietor. The owner of a Newfoundland
dog next door, thinking to have a lark, pulled
down some palings and let his dog through to the
bull-dog. The Newfoundland never returned—
Bully killed him outright. Then another bull-dog
came round and put his head through the palings.
Bully seized him and held on for so long that a
law-suit ensued. Mean while most of the principals
arrived in Sydney, and then the conductor died.
W. Shine, the Spoofah Bey of the cast, arrived
later and had his boxes lost at Adelaide, mean-
while going on in the piece for the first few per-
formances in a borrowed frock-coat and top-hat.
A few days before the opening, the scenic artist
fell ill and, owing to his illness, there was no
dress-rehearsal. The first night was a series of
complicated disasters. After a week the bulldog
was run over by a tram and chopped up. As he
had no understudy the part had to be cut out.
Then Billy Elton and Joe M’Mahon, driving home
from the races, had their dogcart smashed up,
the horse injured, and themselves nearly killed.
One of the swans that swam near the backcloth in
the first act —after several times attempting to
?i°D ie OWI \ footlights to protest against the
‘Pas de Cinq,” and having to be “hooshed ” back
by the principals—eventually died of shame.
Before any further catastrophes had time to occur
the season providentially ended.
“It is with sorrow and surprise I have
learned, since coming to this colony, that men
who claim to be Liberals are yet the advocates of
the High Tariff. They call it a policy of Protec-
tion, whereas, in reality, it is a policy of attack.”

Church, Melbourne.
Dear Bulletin, —-Can you rouse up the
controversial scientists ? It is now asserted that
the planet Mars has no atmosphere. Proctor long
ago declared the Moon to be “a dead world ” and
sans atmosphere. Now, consider the sum of pre-
sen t_ human knowledge as regards the transmission
of light. Our naked eyes see the Moon as a
luminous disc and Mars as a reddish star. If
there is no atmosphere around either, what is
there? What carries the rays of light that belong
to the solar system? Is it ether? Or what?—

When the Shearers’ Accommodation Bill
was before the Maoriland Parliament, Hogg-,
M.H.R.. moved an amendment that shearers
should be supplied with proper food, which
amendment was thrown out by 44 votes against
11. Therefore, it seems that a four to one
majority is of opinion that shearers should not
have proper food.
Debs, president of the American Railway
Union strikers, when lately asked by a State Com-
mission if he believed in strikes when they caused
innocent parties to suffer, said: “I believe in
strikes to resist oppression, no matter on whom
the suffering falls.” “Do you believe in Govern-
ment ownership of railroads?” “Yes; it is
preferable to railroad ownership of the Govern-
ment.”

STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 547 George-street, Sydney, in the Colony of
New South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which
affected me so much that I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several doctors
and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr
Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal ‘Alkaline
Vitality Pills,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare COMPLETELY Cured Me with-
in a few weeks, and although this is over five
years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alkaline Pills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative
of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose
testimony carries special weight, writes thus :
Ti> Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, -I think it my duty to inform you
that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills
acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them
to many friends, who have all been cured by
their use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness
and Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform
you that a course of your Alfaline Pills com-
pletely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention
that several of my friends to whom I have
recommended your remedies have derived great
benefit from them; therefore, I consider you
are deserving of success, which I do most
heartily wish you.—Yours gratefully,
* A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having
been a sufferer from General Debility of the
Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the
leading doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne,
I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses
of the Alfaline Remedies I am now completely
cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I
was. Thanking you for your courtesy and
the uniform patience with which you have
treated me, allow me to say that you can
make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,
yours, CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

’—GRAND-
Spring Show.
Good Washers All.
These have always been a leading line, and the
present season is no exception to its predecessors.
Possibly you don’t know it, but they had a wet
summer in Europe, and consequently large quan-
tities of the season’s goods were left on hand, and
manufacturers were triad to quit at a low price for
SPOT CASH. And .
SPOT GASH DID IT.
Our buyers toured the manufacturing districts,
and, CASH IN HAND, had the pick of the
most beautiful of the goods made for the European
summer trade. This splendid operation will have
a tremendous effect on the section concerned, and
in natural course upon the selling prices. The
cost of a dress will be less, while the assurance
will remain that the gown exhibits every fashion-
able characteristic. So marked is the difference
in many favorite lines that a dress and a-half will
cost no mure than a single one under any other
circumstances. It will be well to bear these facts
in mind when contemplating the purchase of
Washing Materials.

A NEW CARDINAL.
In connection with the cablegram which reached
Sydney the other day to the effect that Monsignor
Satolli, the Papel delegate to the United States of
America, is to be created a Cardinal, we publish a
portrait of that eminent ecclesiastical dignitary.
Monsignor Satolli, who is an Italian, was sent to
America by the Pope to settle the differences of
opinion existing among the Roman Catholic
prelates on the schools question and the rights of
jurisdiction. His “ mission ” has been very
successful, and he has been welcomed in many
places in the States as a distinguished visitor. In
July last, Monsignor Satolli arrived at Waterbury,
and was entertained by clergy and laymen. A
reception was given in his honor, and, with the
Mayor and other prominent residents, he visited
the factory of the Waterbury Watch Company.
He ■expressed his surprise and pleasure at seeing
the Waterbury Watch Company’s wonderful
machinery, and the almost perfect system that
pervades the great building. Monsignor Satolli
was presented with a Waterbury watch of one of
the new ecclesiastical patterns, and he was
delighted with the unique design, as well as the
thoughtfulness that prompted the gift. In return,
the Prince of the Church sent his photo, with his
autograph.

Husbands and fathers are warned against
a kind of family art-gallery, purporting to be a
journal of spring and summer fashions, just issued
by Anthony Hordern and Sons. The pictures of
gowns, hats, and etceteras are so numerous and
seductive that this dangerous production will be
worse than a bomb in the bank-account.
John Howe, for whom is claimed the title
of ‘ ringer of Queensland shearers,” represents
his tally for the last eight years as 82,400, which,
at ■£ l per 100, comes to .£824. Howe worked
only about five months out of each year, however.
The fact is instructive, inasmuch as it enables the
public to see both what a first-class man actually
earned, and what it was possible for him to have
earned at shearing had work been constantly
available.
A Queensland correspondent: “ When
you see telegrams in the daily press announcing
‘ Another shed burnt by unionists !’‘shed ’doesn’t
mean always the costly corrugated iron or sawn-
timber buildings of Riverina, but simply posts set
in the ground and roofed (save the mark !) with
boughs from the nearest scrub. And yet insur-
ance co.’s, until recently, insured these wrecks
with the wool contained therein. In fact, a few
co.’s still do so.
“ The settled policy of New South Wales,”
as it is the fashion to call Freetrade, has
amongst its absurdities the kerosene duty im-
posed by a Ministry which included Cob-
den Club medallist Parkes, which duty was
acquiesced in by Cobden Club medallist
Reid. At present prices, the duty is about
240 per cent., and was imposed for the benefit of
a company which distils a middling sort of
oil from shale. In Victoria there is no kerosene
duty, and in Melbourne gas is cheaper and better,
though coal is dearer than in Sydney. Thus that
huge monopoly, the Australian Gaslight and Coke
Co. of Sydney, is the real gainer by the kerosene
duty, while the kerosene shale is more profitably
used for gas than for oil-making.
The City Mutual Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.,
whose head offices are at 95 Pitt-street, Sydney,
combines low rates with prompt payments. Its
subscribed capital is =£150,000, and it is entirely
an Australian institution, all funds being invested
in New South Wales, while a cash-bonus is paid
to policy-holders every year. The chairman of
directors is the Hon, John See (late Colonial
Treasurer), and his colleagues are the Hon.
John T. Toohey, M.L.C., James P. Garvan,
Esq., Patrick Hogan, Esq., M.P., Patrick
Stanley, Esq., J.P., and John Donelan, Esq.
The head offices have lately been altered and
renovated in such a way as to give increased
accommodation for clerks and the public, while
the board-room and manager’s room have been
considerably enlarged. The interior decoration
has been renewed in a remarkably artistic manner.
The ceiling of the main office is divided into two
bays by a girder. Each bay has been formed into
two square panels, enclosing an octagonal panel of
light buff, surrounded by a border of ornament in
light blue. At each corner is a panel bearing the
arms of the company in raised ornament on a
terra-cotta ground, relieved by a sage - green
border. The intermediate panels, forming the
continuation of the border, are of a pale blue,
with white ornament. The walls of the office are
painted in oil a delicate steel-grey, with a frieze
of pale straw color enriched by stencilled orna-
ment in terra-cotta; being divided from the ceil-
ing by a gold cornice. The board-room and
manager’s office are decorated in a much lighter
style than the main office. The walls of
the board - room are papered with a hand-
some gold paper, with heavy frieze; and
with dado and rail of heavy Japanese leather
paper of splendid design. The general effect of
the renovations is to give largely increased facili-
ties for the conduct of the company’s rapidly
increasing business.*
A GREAT DOCTOR,
AND A VERY MODERATE FEE.
There are very few people in Australia who have
not, at one time or another, been compelled to
call in a physician to prescibe for some painful
ailment. _ And we generally find that “thegreater
the physician the greater the fee.” In these times
of depression, fees are awkward snags for anyone
except the recipients to strike. To avoid heavy
doctors’ fees in all cases of pain use
ST. JACOBS OIL,
the Marvellous Health-Restorer and
Pain-Banisher.
THE FEE IS ONLY HALF-A-CROWN.

Talmage has dashed across the Australian
sky like a patent Yankee meteor, a nine-days
wonder of which the tenth day finds no trace. He
denounces drink, of course, but only for the reason
that he has found a better substitute. “When I
feel out of sorts,’’ he told a startled interviewer,
' w h6n gorgons and hydras and chimaeras come
gibbering along the nerve-tracks of this wonderful
body of mine, and variegated serpents curl and
twist along the corridors of this magnificent brain,

When Isaac A. Isaacs quitted the Patter-
son Government because of the clumsy efforts
made by his colleagues to stop the trial of Matthew
-Davies, he showed himself the one really far-
sighted man in a miserably stupid Cabinet. At
that time Patterson had a steadily-increasing
majority, and the country at large didn’t seem to
care a straw about the Davies prosecution, and, so
far as appearances went, the Solicitor-General was
throwing away his salary and his prospects in a
hopeless cause. But Isaac A. Isaacs was the only one
of them all who knew when to come in out of the
wet. Public enthusiasm was long in developing,
but when the time arrived it burst forth so
strongly that if Isaacs had had 14 brothers they
could all have got into Parliament on the strength
of his reputation. As he hadn’t 14 brothers, the
grateful community rushed in other Hebrews
instead, and the present is the most aggressively
Jewish Legislature that ever existed in’Victoria.

When Alf. Outtrim told his Maryborough
(Vic.) constituents that he was in favor of a State
Bank, an elector rose up and asked him if he
thought a State Bank, managed by the old Parlia-
mentary crowd, would be a safe place for any-
body’s money. Then Outtrim made a hurried
mental review of Bent and Patterson and Shiels
and O’Loghlen, and reluctantly acknowledged
that he didn’t feel quite sure it would.
Dear Bulletin —Let me enter for the tightest
place. Last summer I was working in a tunnel
by myself. Standing outside my forge and partly
sunk in the ground was a full-sized whip-bucket
which I used to quench my drills in. One day I
had finished sharping and was standing over the
cask smoking when my pipe dropped out of my
mouth into the water. I groped about with the
tongs awhile but could not find it; so, as there
was but two feet or so of water in the cask, I slid
in head-first and felt for the pipe with my hands.
I soon found it, but to my horror when I tried to
get out again I couldn’t. This was bad enough,
but when I had been there for perhaps an hour a
fearful thunder-storm came on and big hailstones
began to descend. After the hail came the rain
in torrents, and the cask began to fill. I gave up
all hope of keeping my head above water, and
commenced to pray, when two men who had been
shooting came rushing to my forge for shelter ;
they saw my legs sticking out of the cask and
thought I had suicided, but my yells soon un-
deceived them, and they hauled me out just as
the water had risen to my mouth. Wasn’t that a
tight place ? — Hatter.

munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co,,
writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

“Since Yesterday is Dead.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN).
There is a deep-green garden where white-robed
Love walks free, . .
On grass no frost lies hard on, in sound of Austral
Clothed’ by the moon in whiteness, barred with
broad bars of jet,
Framed in the purple brightness of Nights star-
spangled net,
Where Heaven to Earth draws nearer, with ear
that almost hears,
With keener gaze and clearer Love reads the
running years, .
White Love among the roses, a low-voiced woman
dwells,
And views as dim day closes those lone star-
citadels,
She sweeps the ferns with tresses, gold tresses lett
unbound, . , ,
The cheek no hand caresses is dewy as the ground;
The jasmines fail before her, for sweeter is her
The passion-flowers adore her, hushed on her
heart to rest, .
And x_x touch not even her fluttering garment s
Stars of Earth and Heaven draw close her life
to them. , ~, . ,
And that strange world enfolds her, as some far
world of space,
God’s sleepless eye beholds her, God s breath is
on her face. „ ,
The gulf lies deep for ever, filled full with floods
of tears, _-t . i
Death could not further sever than Lues long
weary years!
Shall passion breathe to passion from Earth to
white moonfields ? .
Shall eyes of Love’s own fashion drop down their
ivorv shields ,
When fiercer eyes devour, when other lips draw
near,
When strikes the fatal hour for soul and sense to
hear?
Alas, as spheres divided are eyes and lips that
love, ,
No voice that softly chided, yet willing as the
dove.
No lips that seemed retreating, yet ever nearer
Alas — w hen souls are meeting shall lives and
worlds be two !
Shall love, who lived on feasting, take ashes for
his bread ? . ,
Be greatest thing as least thing—since yesterday
is dead.
There is a sea betwixt us most deadly desolate,
As sands thereof God mixed us —it s name give
heed! is Fate. ,
Palms wave around your dwelling, the roses life
is long, ...
But winds of fierce compelling freeze my faint
heart to strong.
You in your jasmine-arbor, I on my Northern
Two P ships that seek one harbor they shall not find
That sea of mightier horror, of colder clutch than
Death, , . ,
Draws gladder hearts and sorer, draws fresh and
fading wreath —
Draws lives as leaves down-shaken, the prayer, the
hope, the cry,
The young eyes that awaken, the lips that draw
too nigh,
Draws souls that at Life’s portal see light where
all should grope, _ ~ , ~
And beat with breath immortal, and drink gold
wine of hope—
Draws youth (if youth would linger), draws all
men’s idle names, ,
Draws down the song and singer, and honors
crown with shame’s ;
All wings too far upsweeping, too near the golden
sun, ,
Too near the perfect reaping of harvests Love has
won ;
All crowns too nigh the winning, all feet too near
the goal, . . . , .
Down the broad tide set spinning, they break on
rock and shoal !
Lest gladness tire of playtime and end in rapturous
So green time falls with grey time, and both lie
drowned and deep.
Dear Love 1 could we be stronger than Life, or
God, or Fate,
Keep rapture lingering longer at that relentless
gate, ,
Clutch only one another out of the mist and
wrftck
Out of the waves that smother bring Love in
safety back 1 _
Ah, billow rolls on billow, I drift in utter night,
Without your heart for pillow, without your eyes
for light;
Oh love of morn and even, Oh light of night and
day !
Oh ! breast that was my heaven ! as dreams you
fade away !
Blasts over wild waves shrieking, white gulls that
seaward sweep,
Cry out to mock my seeking—deep lies apart from
deep ;
And not by your blue waters —not where my oak-
boughs swing,
Shall sons of ours, and daughters, grow like young
plants in Spring;
Pate claims the unborn spirits that Love with life
would crown—
Think you what tears it merits, this dream of ours
gone down—
Gone down with ships that founder, gone down
with faiths that fall,
Profoundness grows profounder to draw hope past
recall! M 1
Sweet Yesterday is over —but grey io-day will
pass
And bring no braver lover across your sun-parched
grass,
And bring no eyes to blind me to your remem-
bered eyes,
To-day has naught to bind me, a world of cloud-
grey skies — ,
To-morrow is for sleeping, for weary heart ana
head, _ . ,
We’ve wept out all our weeping—since Yesterday
is dead.
Oh, Love, my love, mine only ! —think in the
long, sad hours
One heart is even so lonely as yours among the
flowers ! .
Love, which do you remember of all our kisses
past ?
The first in green September—moist April saw
the last,
The last—the last, I know it, your memory clasps
it close, . ,
We shall not now forego it—Life’s crimson-hearted
rose! ,
White arms, white soul, white raiment, and rain
of golden hair,
I pay with bitter payment—yet, ah ! the price is
fair. ,
Oh tall, pale, trembling lily, so light to sway or
bend, _ . _ , .
Your voice seems murmuring stilly, Oh, God, is
this the end?”
“Is this the end?” you asked me —who knows
what I replied,
The gloom of Fate had masked me, the world
looked very wide ;
Your eyes of stormy color, your pale lips burnt to
red,
Seen through a mist, grew duller, a page too
closely read.
The world is for our reading! The world is for
our thought!
Leave Passion in its pleading, if Wisdoms shrine
besought! ,
Fame’s temple is no .garden where white hands
weave white wreaths,
The heart must learn to harden to coldness calm
as Death’s ;
Lips that lean not to kisses, eyes clear from holier
Or else the road he misses for all Time’s endless
years !
So lies the world between us, my lily of the South,
Ah, if no joy had seen us, we had not known such
drouth! .
Be strong as I, nay, stronger, your stars will give -
you strength—
Not long, no not much longer life drags rw>
darkening length,
Night shall fall on ray seeking, shall close your
eyes’ dimmed light,
And my heart will be breaking to hear you say
“Goodnight,”
Ere you should fall in slumber, upon my heart
your head —
No more “ good nights ” we number—since yester-
day is dead.
Oh, sweetest love, oh, dearest—think you my
dreams forget ,
The hour that drew us nearest, ’twixt one moon s
rise and set 1
Sweet Love ! my heart remembers each passion-
quickened beat.
Life lies like blackened embers on lakes of flaming
heat; ,
The mountain’s heart is fire—snow wreathes the
mountain’s brow ; ,
Oh, Life’s dear one desire ! my heart beats tor
you now,
Now, now, in your pale sorrow ! Alas ! what
vain words said ! .
No day for us, no morrow, since Yesterday is
dead,
Sydney, Sept. 9.

A LULLABY SONG.
Patterson, Patterson, snuffed like a candle ;
Now that the voters have put out your light,
Say, why on earth were you decked with a
“ handle? ”
Answer that question, Victorian knight.
Is it explained by your pitiful plight?
Patterson, Patterson, one time so cheerful,
Travelling round with your pestilent “ blow,”
What can you say to the multitude sneerful —
Why did your Sovereign “ honor ” you so?
Thousands of scoffers are wanting to know.
Patterson, Patterson, think of Mat Davies,
Likewise of Bingy, who burst with the boom—
See how they stew in their titular gravies,
Lasting derision their merited doom ;
Think of their fate as you glare in the gloom.
Patterson, Patterson, king of a season,
Tested and found a political blight,
Can you invent a respectable reason
Why you should cling to the title of “ knight ? ”
Has it a value in anyone’s sight ?
Patterson, Patterson, cast-iron Tory,
Proof against ridicule’s sharp-pointed knife.
Yours was the pride and the honor and glory
Of sending that cable to York and his wife,
Wherefore the butcher was branded for life.
AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM.
There are some truths that ought to be blown
through a million speaking trumpets every hour;
that ought to be printed in big type on the front
page of every newspaper; that ought to be painted
■on every signboard at the crossroads ; that ought
to be taught in every school. And this is one of
them : There is no such thing on earth as a tonic
medicine.
People talk of “ tonics ” and doctors talk of
“ tonics.” Pshaw ! When a country is discovered
in which no food stuffs are ever raised or imported,
and in which the men, women, and children are
all well and hearty, we may conclude they subsist
on some sort of “tonic.” The mischief this
delusion about tonics has done is beyond calcula-
tion. It leads the sick to lean on broken reeds,
to expect relief from a source from which it is
simply impossible that relief can come, to waste
money in buying “tonics,” and precious time in
waiting for these alleged “tonics” to work
miracles.
Mr. Thomas Foster, of 15, Chatham Place,
Adelaide Street, Hull, in an account of a recent
illness, says, among other things, this: “I then
tried stomach tonics, but they did me no good.”
Suppose we have his whole story, which is short,
and make our comment on it afterwards. He says :
“ Up to the month of June, 1891, I was strong and
healthy. At that time I fell into a low, weak
condition. I felt languid and heavy, and was
always tired. I had a foul taste in the mouth,
and a dreadful pain in the chest and sides after
eating, whilst my stomach was like a burning Ure.
I was much troubled with wind, which Seemed to
roll all over me, and I had a constant belching and
rising in my throat. I was in agony day and
night, and for hours I walked about the room
rubbing my chest in the effort to obtain relief.
I lost a deal of sleep, and felt worse tired in the
morning than when I went to bed. Gradually I
became weaker and weaker until I had hard work
to follow my employment, for / was in misery all
the time.
“ I went to a doctor, who sounded me and gave
me medicines, but I got no relief, and after taking
his medicines for a month, I left off going to him.
I then tried stomach tonics and other medicines but
nothing did me any good. In this state I con-
tinued week after week, growing more feeble all
the while. I felt that if I did not soon find a
remedy I should be done for altogether.
“In October, 1891, a book was left at my house
telling of a medicine called Mother Seigel’s Cura-
tive Syrup, and describing a case like mine that
had been cured by it. As I had often heard this
medicine well spoken of, I made up my mind to
try it, and got a bottle from Mr. Cousins, in
Anlaby Road. After I had taken two doses, I felt
grateful relief, and before I had quite finished the
bottle I was completely cured, and have since been
in the best of health.
“ I thank God that this medicine was ever made
known to me. Otherwise I should have been in my
grave before now. I will answer anyone who may
write concerning the facts here set forth. Yours
truly (Signed), Thomas Foster, 15, Chatham Place,
Alelaide Street, Hull, March 24th, 1892.”
Now let us see. The symptoms of Mr. Foster’s
complaint are easily recognisable. He suffered
from indigestion and dyspepsia. The medicines
administered by his physician or purchased by
himself proved useless because they were not
addressed to the disease with which he was actually
afflicted, but possibly to one or more of its symp-
toms. To abolish any existing evil it is always
causes we must work at —never mere conse-
quences.
The “ stomach tonics ” which Mr. Foster hoped
might relieve him may have done so for a moment
on precisely the same principle that a sharp
application of whip and spur wakes up a tired
horse, not by giving him strength, but by rousing
his reserved nervous force, with a deeper reaction
to follow. That’s how it ever was and will be.
Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup restored this
gentleman to real and genuine health by cleansing
his system of the poison of disease, by removing
the obstacles and enabling the stomach to retain
and digest food. A very simple thing, yet how
hard to accomplish, oh ! my masters.
The remedy does it, however, as is testified by
a host of witnesses all over the world—witnesses
who say more in praise of its merits than you
would have time to read.
Encore the Sydney College of Music.
“The Sydney College of Music, 1894,” developes
fresh beauties the more it is examined. As stated
in the official pamphlet, its objects are “To
advance the art and science of music, to improve
the professional and technical education of musical
students, to provide for the delivery of lectures on
musical subjects, to ascertain by means of public
examinations the persons who have acquired pro-
ficiency in music .... and to grant to such
persons diplomas or certificates of proficiency, and
other awards and distinctions proportioned to
their respective attainments, and also to confer
honorary distinctions upon persons who have ren-
dered important service to music. ” The Bulletin
intends to apply for an honorary distinction on
the ground that the exposure of this transparent
piece of musical empiricism is an “ important
service to music. ” If the Council desires to improve
the professional and technical education of musical
students, why have they shut out the leading
professional musicians from their ranks ?
Further on in the pamphlet it appears that the
Council have appointed themselves for life.
“Members,” runs the regulation with regard to
membership, “ of the College (that is, common or
garden members, outside the Council) shall enjoy
such privileges as the College Council shall from
time to time confer on them(!)” And again—
“ The College Council may from time to time
admit persons of Distinguished Positions or
Attainments, or such as have rendered eminent
service to the College, to be honorary members
thereof.” Eminent service to the College, mind
you, not eminent service to musical art. There is
nowhere any mention of any election of Council
members or any rule giving power to elect, or any-
thing compelling the Council to retire from any
cause whatever. No, it seems that they have
elected themselves a perpetual Council, to sit en
permanence , to confer privileges from time to time
on persons paying a guinea, or Persons of Dis-
tinguished Position who have rendered eminent
services to the College or who have enough capital
letters after their names; but no one is to be
given any voting power or voice in the manage-
ment, election of managers, or, indeed, anything.
It would appear to be true that, while masquera-
ding in the garb of Public Duty, these gentlemen
are pursuing a policy of Energetic Private Enter-
prise on the strictly limited principle.
The word college, in its general acceptation,
means a place where something is taught, some
instruction given. Not so in this case. ; This
college does not propose to teach anybody any-
thing, probably for very good reasons. It only
proposes to examine. It will not teach in class.
Its council are all private teachers. One rule says
—“ Members of the college will have the privilege
of entering candidates at reduced fees.” That is
to say, they will have power to enter their own
pupils and friends at reduced fees. It is vain to
search through the book for any provision for a
thoroughly competent and independent board of
examiners. There is no such provision. True,
under the head “ examiners ” this occurs —“ From
time to time, as found expedient, resident and
visiting musicians will be invited to adjudicate.”
It seems plausible, but are the talented foreign
and native artists who have been shut out of this
close corporation likely to adjudicate? Hardly.
And so, as visiting artists are few and far between,
the council will be compelled to adjudicate them-
selves. Indeed, one of the councillors, Mr.
Delany, has already been appointed “Chairman of
the Board of Examiners.” If it is necessary to have
such things as diplomas, etc., then no power but
the State through the Department of Education
should administer the letters of the alphabet to
the patients, and they should appoint the Board
of Examiners from among the Competent.
In the name of Art, which includes common
sense, is this how young Australia is to be musi-
cally straight-jacketed? What originality can
possibly come out of such a scheme as this?
English is written in big letters all over it.
English teachers are to carry on th'e good old
exploded English system of teaching harmony and
counterpoint, and brand the victims with the same
old brands. And When hordes of people are let
loose with A.S.C.M. and L.S.C.M. hanging onto
them like a tin-pot to a dog’s tail, how will musical
art be helped ? A set of bumptious imbeciles will
be created whose love for alphabetical decoration
will far exceed their love for Art.
If Australians are to avoid becoming objects of
ridicule to the musical world they will rise and
tramp heavily on their dull British institution.
John Bull is not musical. Even the Royal College
of Music (of which this seems to be a feeble imita-
tion) has not succeeded in doing anything as yet
but distribute capital letters. We must not allow
the stream of Australian music to be headed off
towards dull hymn tunes, snuffly anthems, and
the ecclesiastical music of the Established Church.
We want that science, that sweetness, that depth,
that vigor, that originality, the secret of which is
held by the continental peoples. Founding their
schools upon the achievements of the past, in
direct succession from Bach, Mozart, Gluck,
Beethoven, Chopin, Rossini, Mosoheles, Verdi,
Gounod, Auber and Halevy, they pass on to us
the best traditions of musical art; and it is from
them, and not from England, that we will learn
how to enclose the Australian sunshine, the tones
and atmosphere of Australia, in our music.
In short, any attempt to shut out the foreign
musicians, resident in Sydney, from-participation
in the shaping of Australia’s musical destiny will
recoil on the impudent heads of those who
attempt it. We want the best we can get from
all nations to join in shaping our growth, and,
above all, we want to avoid the portentous dull-
ness and somnolency of musical John Bullism.
“The Sydney Musical College, 1894,” is an
appropriate name, for it will have no existence to
speak of in 1895.

George Anson once had a harrowing experience. Late
one night, in the bar of the George, St. Kilda, Anson was
accosted by a slightly inebriated dude with, “ Hallo,
Elton, old man. How are you, Billy?” Anson got on
his dignity, and exclaimed, “My name’s not Elton. I
am George Anson.” To which answered the Johnny,
“ Oh, that’s all right, Billy. You don’t have me. I’m
up to your little joke.” Anson got mad. “All right,”
said he, “I’ll soon show you that I’m Anson,” and pro-
ceeded to have that weird fit he used to give in “Dr.
Bill,” during the progress of which he rolled the dude all
over the floor, and broke furniture with him, and damaged
him generally. The dude, however, came up all smiling,
simply said, “You’re a d d funny fellow, Billy,” and
stood drinks for the crowd. When parting at the door,
the inebriated one fell on Anson’s neck, saying, “Good
night Elton, old man; you’re a clever fellow, but that
chap Anson is a blanky idiot 1” The “boys” laughed
hilariously, but Anson’s language was unfit for publics-
tlon. .
At one of the Sapio-Urso concerts, at Wellington (M.L.),
an intoxicated person wandered through the stage-
entrance, and along various passages, until at last he
landed at the open door Of the dressing-room,
where he proceeded to dance a hilarious jig. They
couldn’t scream without disturbing Sapio and Scherek,
who were in the middle of a duet on the stage, so they
banged the door and held it on the inside, while the
visitor howled terms of endearment at them from without.
The two gentlemen on the stage heard the riot, and
vaguely understood that some unauthorised person was
trying to kiss their wives during their absence. But
their sense of duty to the audience was paramount, and
they finished their duet in a state of awful suspense, yet
without slurring a single note. Then they bowed to the
audience, and rushing behind the scenes they threw the
intruder down stairs in 16 pieces.
A really unique aspirant for music-hall honors turned
up in a recent Melb. law-case. She was the daughter of
an up-country school-teacher, and ran away to Melbourne
to be a swinging beauty at Frank Clark’s show. Writing
to a member of the co. to meet her at the station, she
said: “ You will know me by my freckles.” That girl
knew her sphere; the variety business would certainly
knock spots off her.
Ructions at London Lyric, resulting in the secession of
May Yohe. Florence St. John takes her place as Little
Christopher Columbus, whilst Geraldine Ulraar now plays
Guinevere Block in the new and revised version. It plays
too long at present, and Lounen must have a lot of his
twaddle cut out. It is remarkable, says The Bulletin’s
London correspondent, what a run so poor a piece has
had. Johnny Sheridan has been one of the causes, for he
is inimitable as the second Mrs. Block.
“ Little Jack Sheppard,” just revived at London
Gaiety, is going very dottily indeed, and proves once
more that the old order has completely changed, remarks
Tub Bulletin’s London correspondent. Teddy Royce
and Charles Danby are the principal “ mirth provokers,
but they must find the work pretty hard.
“ Little Jack Sheppard ” is not quite ten years old, but
out of the first Gaiety cast five performers-Fred Leslie,
David James, Miss Wadman, Harriet Coveney and Emily
Duncan—are dead and gone, and Nellie Farren has become
a physical wreck.
A pulpit orator in America recently took upon himself
to denounce the plays produced by Mrs. Brown-Potter
and “Curly,” and as the pair walked out of the church
with somewhat pardonable indignation, he proceeded to
inveigh against them personally. The question that
strikes one is what the devil they were there to do . The
goody-goody game?

a fat salary interest in the unsuccessful production of the
“King Kodak” burlesque. Manager Abud was lately

A traveller who, by great persistence and much diplo-
macy, got admission to the Chapel of the Cathedral of
Shoa (Abyssinia), found the walls of that sanctuary—pro-
bably the most profoundly holy place in all Africa—hung
round with glaring oleographs representing the British
leg-show females in various stages of undress. Yet the
Abyssinian prays there in a devout spirit, and the un-
clothed coryphee doesn’t take his attention off heavenly
things.
A Parisian music-hall has got something like a sensa-
tion. The curtain goes up and reveals a pretty woman in
bed in an elegantly-appointed bed-room. A clock strikes
ten, whereupon a neat waiting-maid comes in, awakens
her mistress, and tells her it is time to get up and git.
Then she slowly arises in an embroidered nisrht-dress with
great quantities of lace upon it, and dresses herself in
garments that are a poem and a dream of loveliness,
before the eyes of an enraptured audience. For some un-
fathomable reason very few men go to this show', but the
women roll up in multitudes to sigh over the beautifully-
appointed bedroom, and the silk stockings and expensive
linen and cambric underclothing, and all the other items
of the wardrobe. The lady who forms the centre of this
show doesn’t dance or do anything else after she is
dressed ; she sings one or two snatches of song while her
great masses of hair are being brushed with an ivory
brush, but apart from this she merely wakes up and
dresses herself and then goes away.
Dining at a country hotel, W. S. Gilbert found himself

Leon Caron owes a deal of his advancement to Madame

Recent “ living pictures ” at the Empire Theatre, Lon-

vanquishing the Matabele, who waved assegais at them
from afar. At least, the surviving Matabele were making
a demonstration with these crude weapons, but most of
the miserable “ rebels ” lay in a heap of slain. This pic-
ture was labelled “ British Pluck,” and the audiences
took it quite seriously. Doubtless it is still stirring the
souls of the populace. A tableau of that description,
accompanied by. “ Rule Britannia” from a first-class
orchestra, is just what a Londoner likes, especially if he
stands flve-feet-nothing and serves in a draper’s shop.

brutality, and remained motionless. Gradually a crowd
gathered round the dreadful object and speculated as to
the crimes it must have committed. When the crowd
was at its thickest the exhibit straightened itself up and
walked away, leaving two women in hysterics and half-a-
dozen bucoiic visitors bolting for the door.

with rose ; marvellously well shaped, like a statue ol
Apollo.” This item is inserted in the “shows” column
principally because the Devil had nothing on.

Critics, and Other Refletions.
PEAK Bulletin,— Your critic, “ Walter Clay,”
should know that there are pilots and pilots—
river pilots, “Channel” pilots, deep-sea pilots.
Jn England, where Tennyson wrote, the most
common variety is the Channel pilot. He meets
you at the mouth of the Mersey, or the Humber,
or the Thames, and takes you perhaps as far as
the Lizard, when you set sail across blue water on
your own account. And the bar is just the spot
where he comes aboard. Here the obscure
river specimen leaves, and the deep-sea man
takes his place. Surely “Walter Clay” remem-
bers the yarn of the Soilly pilot who knew “all
the rocks in the Channel,” and said as the vessel
struck, “That’s one!” Why didn’t he “turn
home” when he got to the bar? Tome, it has
always seemed appropriate that a pilot should
come to guide the poor trembling soul
over the Infinite into its Aidenn. “ Poets don’t
know everything ’’—true. Neither does Walter.
Or he would not tell you that so much of the best
poetic thought—Milton’s? Wordsworth’s? Ros-
setti's ? —has been spoiled by the tyranny of
sonnet-construction, and therefore the sonnet must
go Why? To a poet it is as easy to build a
sonnet as it is for Parkes to rhyme “ doggie ” and
“loggie.” The sonnet-form has never cramped
genius. On the contrary, as the perfection
of melodious brevity, it has enabled it
to give an exquisite setting to exquisite
thought. Elsewhere, Clay insists on the
need of brevity; but I suppose this is only his
aggravating way. He annoys me, too, by com-
paring “Ghosts” to [“jewels five-words long”]
“which should sparkle, as Tennyson says, ‘on
the stretched forefinger of all time.’” Now,
Tennyson never dreamed of saying that four four-
line verses would sparkle on the stretched fore-
finger of all time; and I am surprised that so
hypercritical a Walter should accuse him of the
incongruity. Further, Olay is of opinion that
“Ghosts” is a finer poem than “Crossing the
Bar.” I respect his opinion; but prefer my own,
which is that “Ghosts” is a remarkably fine bit
of verse, and “Crossing the Bar” is a remark-
ably fine poem. As I see that the names
which Walter chooses for special mention
in discussing modern poetry are those of Kipling
(a brilliant verse-writer), Swinburne (a poet of
limited range), and Watson (a poet of more limited
range), I shall not try to convince Clay; especially
as I might waste a page without making the
ground of my distinction clear. Poetry-readers
will understand when I take the first names that
come to mind, and say that Kendall had more of
the poet than Gordon, and Gordon than Stephens;
that Matthew Arnold was a poet, and Edwin
isn’t; that Whitman was a poet, a.nd Longfellow
wasn’t—nor Emerson ; that “ Nevermore ”is not
a poem, and “The Haunted Palace” is; that the
“Ingoldsby Legends ” are not poems, and “ As I
Lave a-Thynkynge” is; and so on ad in.
Noting, in passing, that the “ uniformity of
metrical construction,” in which Mr. Ropes is
alleged to “score heavily against the dead
laureate,” is, for the most part, the monotonous
companion of mediocrity ; I close by venturing
the reflection that, if an age is coming when a
poet will write, nd will have to write, in the
fashion of the cablegram correspondent, then a
very sad age will be mated to a very bad poet.—
Yours, Arthur Bray.

The Song of the Dead.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
Death came to us, and beckoned,
We feigned we did not see,
We hid our eyes a second,
And blindly prayed that he,
The Raven-tinted Angel,
Would overlook our souls,
And find new prey to gather
To the muster of his rolls.
In vain we prayed and labored,
In vain we did not see,
For Death, the mailed and sabred.
Had beckoned us, and we,
All bent and blind with weeping,
And wild with wish to stay,
Were driven forth relentless
From the heat of life’s brief day.
11.
Oh, the sweet of lying dead,
Of whispering to yourself, Death’s done, Death’s
done ;
To feel the Death-bands round your head ;
To know the Death tears all are shed,
And Death is past. Death that all life doth
shun.
Oh, the sweet of lonely miles,
Of wanting not to sing, nor speak, nor sigh.
The lips have done with shallow smiles,
The eyes with tears and woven wiles,
And lips and eyes in rest’s own settings lie.
Oh, the sweet of lying still,
Of lying stiller than a sea-deserted shore,
The hands have lost the weary will
That watched their working at life’s mill,
The feet that ached to rest need run no more.
Oh, the sweet of lying still;
Of lying still and still, long year on year.
Wild overhead lives throb and thrill,
Waves beat the shore, and winds the hill,
But only silence ever enters here.
111.
Lying here still in these valleys of death,
Lying all dead, and happy so to bide.
What if there came from life’s far shores a breath
Of those old prayers we uttered when we died?
What if there came the haunting of those tears
We shed and suffered, begging Death to stay
His sword a space, and spare our little years
Of light awhile, and turn his head away ?
What if there came an answer to the prayer
We deafened Death with? What if Death
heard now,
And, smote with sudden pity, cried “Return !”
And straightway took his seal from off our brow?
Lying here still in the valleys of Death;
Lying all dead, and happy so to lie ;
God, God, the horror of a livened breath,
The death-bound body stirring from its tie.
Oh, God ! the horror of this perfect sleep
Made loud with life, and broken with the rain
Of living voices, while our bodies creep*.
With shuddering footsteps, back to life again,
To find therein all old joys turned to gall!
More wild our tears than those we dying shed. , .
Thank God, not all our prayers are answered us,
And “No Returning” bounds the soul once
dead.
Sydney.

Bits from a Blackleg’s Diary.
I was a blackleg once. I do not think I
shall ever be again. The Bulletin shall judge
by my experiences whether the pledge is a rash
one, I was engaged as a shearer in Maoriland.
We all thought over there that the Australian
shearer was too high and mighty a being to con-
descend to work. Our impression was that he
preferred to lie around in the shade and swap lies
with his mates, and that if he did favor any par-
ticular kind of exertion it was riding a buckjumper,
varied by howling orgies at bush shanties. Con-
sequently we thought it quite fair to accept the
offered terms of 17s. per 100 for shearing with the
machine, and 20s. by hand. We believed in indi-
vidual liberty, and our notion of it was that any-
one should be free to accept whatever terms he
chose. Freedom of contract cuts both ways. The
Maoriland agents engaged anyone who offered.
It was to their advantage to be complaisant.
1 hey were paid 10s. per head for all they engaged
—just like shipping Kanakas. So the halt, the
lame, and the blind came to shear, knowing that
if they proved incompetent they would be em-
ployed as rouseabouts. It would be well within
the mark to say that not 250 competent shearers
have come from there, though Maoriland was
“combed ” from end to end.
* • *
We were shipped like convicts, or free
immigrants, or cattle. The steerage was crowded
with 175 persons, and there were not berths for
100. Some slept on the tables. Some under
them. _ Some in the seats. Some in the passages.
Some in the lavatory. Some on the foot of the
companion. Some on deck. It any alarm had
arisen there would not have been boat-accom-
modation for half the number on board. Some of
these days there will be a sensational chapter in
interprovincial travelling. It is supposed to be
the duty of the Customs to see that sufficient
boat-accommodation is found. Yet the shipping-
reports of the day after our arrival stated that
100 odd were “in the steerage.” No account was
taken of the 60 odd shearers shipped on their
agreements,” a copy of which served for a
ticket. The passenger-manifest, therefore, lied.
Yet nobody has been punished.
* * *
The “shearers ” included a large number
of larrikins from Lyttelton and Wellington.
They made the ship a Sheol. Yet the officers en-
forced no order. Marcus Clarke’s undeseribed cell
that drove young Andrews mad was a Sunday-
school compared to that steerage. The steamer
anchored in the harbor, and we were removed by
launch to Chowder Bay, and kept under strict
surveillance for two days. Thirty of our number
had shown their real intention by refusing to
leave the steamer, and the rest of us were counted
several times a day lest any should escape. This
was for our own good, and for fear that any
naughty unionists should-get near us and persuade
us to go away. The P.U. had not much faith in
our tenacity of purpose. The prison treatment
was also used by the landlord and landlady at our
hotel. We were treated with contempt and
suspicion, and some of us suggested to our gaolers
that we might as well be searched at once.
* * *
At the precise moment fixed upon we
were landed at Fort Macquarie and whisked off in
’buses to the station, where special trains waited.
The night-journey was beguiled with buckets of
tea and bread and cold meat and cards and smok-
ing and things. At Orange our carriage was cut
off, the rest going towards Bourke, while an inter-
mediate town was our destination. We were met
by the coaches accompanied by armed troopers
and a squatter —also conspicuously armed. We
cut off through the bush, under the impression
that we had given the slip to the unionists as-
sembled close by. There was not room for all in
the coaches and many of us had to pant behind,
laggards being rounded up by the police. By
devious routes we made 16 miles that day and
camped out, police guarding us all night. A band
of unionists was camped opposite and it was re-
ported, but not believed, that they had tried to
stampede our horses in the night. They met us
next morning on the road but did nothing except
try to persuade us to “come out” and be men.
We were not men—not just yet. Again we
out the wire fence and went through private
property. But we had to come on the main
road again to pass a ford, and here we were
met by a hundred mounted unionists. They
were wild-eyed men who had evidently
roughed it for some time ; good, but ungraceful,
riders on rough, but wiry, horses. They escorted
us tumultuously to near the station, where we
were met by about a hundred on foot, who had
been waiting for us. But they offered no violence,
nor even threats. Some of us were frightened by
them. Those who were so were of that kind who
asked whether kangaroos had horns, and won-
dered who planted all the gum-trees.
* * *
This was on Saturday, and next day the
unionists, "encamped in some spare station huts,
were permitted to confer with us for a-quarter of
an hour. Two of them came, but were sadly lack-
ing in debating-power. They went back to their
mates, saying that God Almighty wouldn’t drag
some of us out. Then they were driven off by the
police, the ground being “ private property,” and
gave us a piece of their mind in passing. The
unionist shearer is a child of nature. His vocabu-
lary is limited, but rose-colored. What he lacks
in variety he makes up in richness and force.
« • «
Next morning shearing began. Stud ewes
were put in—wool down to the toes, and even
between them. New machines. None accus-
tomed to them. After shearing one hour—that is
till dinner-time—the biggest tally was seven. The
shorn sheep looked as if they had been attacked
with blunt adzes. What else could be expected ?
Our numbers had been augmented at several way-
side stations, and we were 46 shearers all told, and
of that number only about 20 could shear at all.
Barbers and tailors and barmen showed how, in
their opinion, sheep ought to be shorn. One
fellow was on his knees, the sheep being on its
feet, and holding it affectionately round the neck
while he gingerly pushed the machine along its
backbone. Some did not know even where to
begin, and one fellow left a skirt of wool hanging
to a ewe’s rearward part that made her the envy
of her sex. However, nature, as exemplified in a
squatter, could not be expected to stand this, so,
after another hour’s trial after dinner, and the
employment of four of our number as experts to
teach the incompetent, work was suspended and
not afterwards resumed by us.
• • »
Then followed two days’ inaction and un-
certainty. Rumours were rife that the boss had
engaged union men to take our places: but at
length instructions came to “roll up ” for a head
station, 10 miles away. Eleven complied com
petent and incompetent, and we had another pi c '
nic of a so-called coach journey. The squatter
rode to Forbes, visited the union camp there and
engaged men under verbal agreement to fill his
board. The unionists thought at first they were
beaten in the West, for that head station was the
key to the position. Afterwards they won uncon
ditionally, and for the defeat the P.IJ. h as on j’
itself to thank. The squatter indicated had
always been against the nefarious agreement of
1894, and only assented to it on condition that he
was supplied with 80 competent machine shearers
on the first of August, and by the end of that
month they sent him 46 of whom only 20 were
competent.
* * *
When we got to the home station we were
informed that we were to be divided into four
gangs for as many different stations. All these
places were infested by unionists, and yours truly
and a mate decided that it was not good enough
to go any further. We felt that we were on the
wrong side, and fighting against the sympathy of
the country. The risk of a broken head may
be incurred in a right cause, but not in an endea-
vor to cut down wages by sneakery. The police
tried to dissuade us from returning, saying that
we would be hurt, and the P.U. emissary said the
same. But we decided to risk it, and were allowed
to return that 36 miles to Forbes through country
almost submerged, and threading our way through
parties of jubilant union men on their way to take
our places. But we only received a civil “ Good
day, mate.” And my own belief is that most of
the shootings and so on stone-throwings
elsewhere have been due to provocation. Some
on each side carry arms, and nothing is more
natural than to resort to them in the height of
quarrel. Of our journey to Forbes I say nothing
nor shall I speak at present of our tramp to Sydney
in a state of destitution. No more blacklegging
for me. 8

entered the room than he rushed like a bull-dog at
the sick man’s throat. In about ten minutes
when nothing breakable or tearable in the room
remained whole, the two naked, bleeding figures
were at last hauled apart, and the fact was elicited
that physician and patient were both equal suf-
ferers from the same complaint.
