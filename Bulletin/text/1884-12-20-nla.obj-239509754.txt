Failure of Law: Triumph of Justice.
The expression, “ plenty of law, but little
justice,” which, owing to the refinements of
legal casuistry, was gradually assuming the
force of an axiom, has suffered a rude check
at the hands of the juries in the criminal
libel case of Pabkes v. Webb. The lesson
taught by these jurymen is one which,
read aright, is brimful of suggestiveness to
all. But it is to the lawyer and the states-
man that the lesson appeals with the greatest
force. Owing to recent judgments of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales—judg-
ments at variance in some important points
with late decisions of the highest English
courts —the law of libel became a mere trap
for the unwary journalist. In the public
interest, he might comment on the shady
actions of public men, expose the motives
which resulted in such actions and by timely
warning do his share towards relegating to
obscurity those whose public actions would
not bear analysis or whose private lives
were a scandal. But if in so doing he hap-
pened to make a statement or offer a sug-
gestion—however irrelevant to the great
question at issue—and found when too late
the impossibility of clearly proving such
statement or suggestion, all the service done
by the really significant allegations he had
made and proved went for nothing. Such
a decision coming from the highest tribunal
in the land meant, in the eyes of many, a
slavish adherence to the letter of the law,
and utter disregard of its spirit. It meant
that no public service performed by the
journalist in letting in the light upon equi-
vocal transactions, or in holding up to
deserved opprobrium the laches of those
who aspired to direct national affairs, would
avail in condoning a trivial slip of the pen
or a slight error of judgment.
• •
Such was the law—such it remains. But
just at this point the most important factor
in English legislation—trial by jury—de-
mands to have a say in the matter. There
is little doubt that if a jury of lawyers had
been empanelled in the cause celehre which
terminated on Saturday last, there would
have been but a short retirement, if any,
from the box, and a touching unanimity on
their return. The letter of the law as laid
down in recent oases would have been up-
held in its entirety. But the juiies in both
cases consisted of mere ordinary citizens,
unversed in legal technicalities, unmindful
of the nice points so dear to the legal mind.
To them the fact that certain allegations
remained unproved was subordinated to
other facts of greater importance from their
standpoint. On each trial they heard what
was to be said on either side, enjoyed each
others’ society for days, retired to argue the
points at issue undisturbed by the pre-
sence of specialists, and returned to pro-
claim that their views were hopelessly
divergent, and the prospect of unanimity
hopelessly remote. Time out of mind, the
institution of trial by jury has been railed
at —sometimes with reason, sometimes with-
out. It was cumbrous, and frequently de-
feated the very ends it was instituted to
promote. But the late abortive attempt to
whitewash the commercial and public repu-
tation of a prominent politician and crush a
not very prominent writer has vindicated
the system in the eyes of many who made
no secret of their opinion that it had, in a
measure, outgrown its usefulness, and was
ill-adapted for performing in nineteenth-
century civilisation the offices it was so
fitted for in a more primitive society.
• * •
In the light of the juries’ disagreement in
the Pakkes-Webb case, the comments made
by some of our contemporaries are instruc-
tive. The Sydney Mobnino Herald ad-
mits, in a half-hearted way, that although
“the character (private) of public men is
important, because men who are dishonest
in the counting-house are not likely to be
honest in the Cabinet,” yet “ nothing ought
to be used as a criticism on public actions
which has no direct connection with them.”
And “ whatever advantage his (Sir Henry
Pabkes’) career may give to a private or
political enemy .... that advantage
must not be pressed beyond the line
that separates public from private af-
fairs.” It goes on to draw a sad picture of
the depths which political life in the United
States touches, owing to this tendency to
mix up the public and private lives of men .
These dicta laid down by our contemporary
are both odd and untenable. If they mean
anything, they mean that the community
has little or no concern with the private
conduct of those who aspire to shape its
destinies. Such guides may be dishonest,
immoral, intemperate; their commercial
careers may be so smirched that reputable
men may decline to deal with them; their
amativeness so ill-controlled that reputable
women endanger .their good name by
being seen speaking to them; their in-
temperance so notorious that decent pub-
licans forbid them their houses. Still
when they try for an entrance into public
life, or succeed in passing the portals, all
this is to be forgotten. They are to be
judged by their public acts alone, and any
journalist who alludes to their private record*
or hints at the absurdity of expecting to
gather wholesome figs from such rank this-
tles, steps beyond his proper vocation, and is
guilty of spite and vulgarity. This is in-
deed, a doctrine startling in its novelty. It
is not in t&e United States alone that such
a canon is set daily at defiance. In England
the growing tendency is in an entirely
opposite direction. There, writers of repute
freely canvass in important journals the
private doings of men who represent them
Were it otherwise—were a veil to be drawn
over the actions of men simply because
those actions had no connection with the
public life of the State—the injury to the
nation’s reputation would quite outweigh
the very problematical good. This, as we
said, is so well understood in the England of
to-day that no aptitude for public affairs
is suffered to condone llagrant violations of
probity. If such were not the case, if the
Herald's dictum were accepted as a safe-
guard in these matters, then the reputable
citizens who would bring to their country’s
councils the cleanness and decency which
characterised their private dealings, would
be placed on the same level as the rogues,
lechers, and drunkards entertaining simi-
lar aspirations.
• • •
In the Parkes v. Webb case two patent
errors appear to have been made by the pro-
secution. The first was in making the action
a criminal one; the second in taking any
action at all. That many think differently
from us in classing the latter as an error we
are well aware. But there is no such dis-
agreement in considering the former as a
palpable mistake. About its lolly there is
but one opinion. And it is little less than
marvellous how such an astute person as Sir
Henry Parkes could have been induced to
commit a blunder so obvious. In adopting
the method which has so signally failed, he
probably followed the counsel of his legal
advisers—men learned in law, conversant
with all its intricacies, and, in view of the
recent decisions already [referred to, confl.
dent of success. But, like the historical
clock-maker, whose clock was a marvel of
ingenuity only that it could not be made to
go, their ingenious anticipations ended in a
humiliating fizzle. Their mountain laboured
without even producing the traditional
mouse. As the watchmaker forgot all abou t
the spring so essential to the success of his
work, so Sir Henry and his advisers over-
looked the fact that before their venture
could be successful, it would be neces-
sary to induce twelve ordinary citizens
to believe them. In this they failed. They
proved a good many things, it is true: among
others that it was possible for a man to be a
great statesman and at the same time a
great—that is to say, an unsuccessful trader.
As we have already hinted, the whole pro-
ceedings were pregnant with useful lessons.

Whites a correspondent, apropos of the recent
Yass flogging case:—It is chiefly the Legislative
Council interest which maintains and yearns for a
further extension of the good old flogging system
in New South Wales. These hoary remnants of
the convict days are the men who would hang and
torture. In their ears the whistle of the lash is as
sweet music, and the creak of the gallows-trap as
the sound of a murmuring brook. Why should
those irresponsible curiosities be allowed thus to
emphasise the brutality 6f our unhappy national
origin, and eternally remind the world that this
colony was swaddled in judicial murder—that she
was born under the shadow of the gaol wall, and
baptised In gore ? Why should Australian citizens
be flogged for small offences, while the people of
England and America and Germany and France,
and every other civilized State, now revolt egainst
punishments belonging to the era of the rack, the
stake, and the scavenger’s daughter ? If flogging is
to be a permanent Institution in New South Wales
it is evident that it must be because either our
people or their rulers are more brutal than the
people or the rulers of other countries. Here are
a few lines of not such very ancient colonial his-
tory, which tell us what New South Wales would
be, had some of the members of the Legislative
Council power to enforce their traditional and
hereditary ideas of justice :—“ I was sent for to
Bathurst Court-house to identify a man supposed
to have taken to the bush from the farm I have
charge of. I had to go past the triangles, where
they had been flogging incessantly for hours. I
saw a man walk across the yard with the blood
that had run from his lacerated flesh squashing out
of his shoes at every step he took. A dog was
licking the blood off the triangles, and the ants
wore carrying away great pieces of human flesh
that the lash had scattered about the ground. The
soourger’s foot had worn a deep hole in the
ground by the violence with which he whirled
himself round to strike the quivering and whealed
back, out of which stuck the sinews—white,
ragged, and s wollen. The infliction was a h undred
lashes, at about half-minute time, so as to extend
the punishment through nearly an hour. The day
was almost hot enough to overcome a mau merely
standing that length of time in the sun; and this
was going on in the full blaze of It. However
they had a pair of scourgers, who gave one an-
other spell and spell about; and they were be-
spattered with blood like a couple of butchers.”
[In everything. Australia is strange—strange in its
fauna, Its flora, its geology. But, strangest of all
*s it in the direction its Democracy is taking. De
Tocquevillk is not by us, and our memory may
be defective: stiff, so far as we do recollect, one
of his impregnable positions was that the progress
of Democracy meant, In penal legislation at least,
the progress of humanity. And with the single
exception of British Australasia, his position is
stiff unassailable. With us, however, penal bru-
tality advances pari pasm with Democracy. We
pride ourselves on our indifference to the opinions
of strangers; but affect indifference as we will, we
cannot blind ourselves to the fact that nations
numbering two hundred millions and justly claim-
ing to occupy the front rank in civilization, have
for years been busily employed in erasing from
their statute-books the mediioval savageries which
we are as busily employed in replacing upon ours.

A Droll Proposal.
Mb, Fxrtii (in the House of Commons):—“ On
Friday 1 shall ask the First Lord of the Treasury
whether in Ailing up the vacancy in the office of
Chief Secretary for Ireland consideration had been
given to the possibility of securing the services of
any Irish member of Parliament familiar with the
requirements of the country, and able to inspire
confidence in the administration of the country.
(Laughter.)’’ The suggestion was received with
laughter. The idea of an Irishman being Chief
Secretary for Ireland was the funniest thing that
had been heard in 8t. Stephen’s for a century.
The oldest member confessed that there might
have been a joke like it a generation or two before
his time; but that since he took his seat, the year
of Catholic Emancipation, he didn’t remember
anything tit to bo bracketed with it. Well, it was
mirth-provoking—there's no denying that. An
Irishman swaying the destinies of Ireland I Yes, it
becomes funnier the more you think c f it. Let us
see. Where were we ? Oh, of course. Of this
laughter-moving picture, it is well to look at the
reverse side, which, believe us, is not nearly so
facetious. At the next general election, it is con-
ceded by his bitterest enemies that Parnell will
have a compact body of from 75 to t5 followers.
Suppose, just for argument’s sake, that English and
Scotch parties are at all equally balanced. The Irish
members will have the ball at their feet, except on
those rare occasions when Whigs and Tories
coalesce in presence of a common and Implacable
enemy. To all appeals to patriotism and the
Integrity of the Empire, those, malignants will be
as deaf as James to the solicitations of Monmouth
The bill of rights will not stop short at an Irish
Chief Secretary, but will Include a local Parlia-
ment as well. The laughter then will bo of a
totally different kind from the mirth of to-day.
Should it occur at all, it will be forced and uneasy
— a mere simulacrum of the spontaneous jollity of
1884. Will there be no course left, then, but to
placate those malcontents by conceding their
claims? Yes, there will be one—the one advo-
cated by a distinguished writer now nearing our
shores, whoso autopsy on the writer of‘‘Sartor
Resartus” is even now moving millions to laughter
and rage: to expel the Irish members, deny the
smaller island Parliamentary representation, and
govern it as a Crown colony the same as India or
Malta. It can be done. An unarmed people to-
day are, in a circumscribed area, powerless against
a force of fltty or even twenty thousand disci-
plined men. Even if armed and unanimous, their
efforts would merely end in shambles, while
their masters held all the strategic
and at short notice could concentrate a crush-
ing force on any threatened point. With a
much larger country in which to operate,
the armed but disorganised Spaniards of
75 years ago could make no headway against
Napoueon’s conscripts till they received succour
from over the sea. Alter Jena, the war-like Prus-
sians were ridden over rough-shod, till the retreat
from Moscow gave them a chance of raising their
heads again. Yesterday, all the resources of
France beat idly against the circumference of the
iron ring surrounding Paris, once the regular
army was destroyed or captured. No.. There
would be no difficulty in ejecting the Irish mem-
bers from Westminster, aud making that island a
Crown colony, but for the fact, so frequently over-
looked, that the majority of Irishmen live out
of Ireland, but within easy hail. This is the
really awkward part of the business — this is
the real hitch, the hitch ignored by the bril-
liant Fboudb and his uncompromising ad-
mirers. The astute land-owning English legis-
lators of a generation ago shook with mirth as
they saw the cabins of Connemara levelled, and
the occupants dying in ditches or sandwiched into
floating coffins for a trip across the Atlantic. The
equally far-seeing Scotch landlords of to-day re.
joice to see the crow-bar doing its work among
the hovels of the Northern crofters—rejoice to
think of the plump grouse and fleet deer the do.
copulated glens will shortly harbour. But we
digress. Let us make Ireland a Crown colony, by
all means, We can do so. We are strong enough,
but—how the words of the greatest of England’s
sons Keep ringing in our ears—“ Better to bear the
ills we have, than fly to others that we know not
of.” We do not know, but we can guess them.
And as the ‘‘Crown colony” project—the only
one, barring local self-government, which will
shortly bo left to fall back upon—would not alono
prompt all homo living Irishmen, of whatever
breed (Celtic, Saxon, Danish, or Norm in) or faith,
to look to the East with hatred and to the West
with hope, but would stir American society to its
depths, it is questionable whether even Mr.
Firth's proposal, ludicrous as It is, is not prefer-
able. Aud now lor a good, long, spontaneous peal
of laughter at the idea of an Irish Chief Secretary.
Hip-hip-hurrah! [Will it be equally spontaneous
five or ten years hence ?— Ed. B.]

AN OCTOGENARIAN’S GRATITUDE.
A FACT.
George-street, Sydney, September 1,1884.
Messrs. Myers and Solomon,
Gentlemen,—It gives me considerable pleasure
to tender you my best thanks for your kind re-
commendation of St. Jacobs Oil. Acting upon
your advice, I tried it, and am happy to say the
very first application brought me instant itellef;
and, by following It up for a couple of days, I felt
completely cured. Before using St. Jacobs Oil I
suffered severely—more especially from swollen
knees—and had tried many other remedies without
the least effect. However, I have to thank it for
making me myself again, and shall be careful to
recommend it.
I may mention that I shall be 80 years of age in
October, and believe that through its use I shall be
able to spend a pleasant birthday.
Yours faithfully,
JOSEPH HENRY.

A Gorgeous Journal.
Let us say it softly—the Press is the Archi-
medean lever that moves the world. The more
there is of it, therefore, the more it will move the
world. And for this reason we are always glad to
sound the timbrel and pi iy upon the dulcimer at
the birth of a now paper. We have now before us
the natal number of a journal which we have no
hesitation in saying is the most gorgeous produc-
tion which has appeared since the invention of
printing. You may believe this when we tell you
that, immediately we had spread it out, we had to
close the bliulls and look at it through smoked
glasses. It is printed in four colours-green blue,
bronze, and scarlet—a id bears the modest title of
the Irish and Australian World. The title is
justified by the sagacious proprietor choosing
such a central place as Narrabri to publish in,
though it may be argued that he would have
shown even maturer judgment in starting it
somewhere on the telegraph line half-way be-
tween Adelaide and Port Darwin. That would
have been more central still. (The proprietor is
an Irishman, and will pardon us this Boyle
Rocher.) But hia commercial astuteness and
far-seeing sagacity in adopting such a title prove
him to have a brain endowed with splendidly
practical ideas, and enriched with superb common
sense. It is very well and proper for humble
printers to confine themselves to a township or a
district, but not so for him. He, to mew his
mighty youth in a cooped-
up colony of hardly a
million people? Pshaw!
It takes two races to
satisfy him. Two races,
did we say? Half a dozen
races we meant,for his pa-
per will be read through
the length and breadth of
the land, and-very pro-
bably — in the depths
thereof. And, we will say
it honestly and fairly, it
deserves to be. There has
been nothing like it since,
the world began. We
would endeavour to de-
scribe it to you, if we
could—to use the words
of a gentleman who wrote
much poetry and drank
more gin — wreak our
thoughts upon expres-
sion. But we feel it to be
impossible with the jour-
nal Itself glittering before
us in all its unearthly
splendour. Words are
weak and vain applied to
it. Yet let us try to give
you a feeble idea of this
magnificent masterpiece
of genius and typography
Imagine, then, a thin and
gauzy sheet, of such deli-
cate tissue that even the
daintily - treading mos-
quito puts his legs
through It, in the fond <
delusion that he can
safely pass across. Imag-
ine-but let us breathe 1

Imagine on this spir-
itualised surface a sym-
phony in green and blue.
Can you? We confess
we are making large
demands upon you, but
our excuse is that this
anglish language of ours
is too weak and colourless
to paint the picture we
would make. But until
we have time to illumic-
ate it with some new ex-
pressions we must take it
as it is. To proceed: At
the too of the page the
title glitters in green arid
blur, Oa one side Tub
Irish, on the other and
Australian, with
World in the middle,
printed on tvhat seems to
be half of a pumpkin.
Shamrocks are twined
among the letters on the
Irish side, cornstalks on
the Australian side. Un-
der the shamrocks ssit an
old gentleman with one
eye in the top of his
head, which is bald, at-
tired in a bed-gown that
falls down to his leet.
There is much expression
in these feet. We can
almost guess w hat county
he comes from by these
alone. They arb T1 -
perary feet, if there are
any feet in Tipperary, in
the distance is a bog.
The old gentleman ap-
pears at first sight to
bo making a bird-cage,
but, on closer investiga-
tion, we discover he is
playing a harp, which
is curious, as ho appears
to have only two
lingers on one hand
and merely an unassum-
ing stump of a finger on
the other. But he evid-
ently means well, for the
eye on the top of bis
skull.is turned pensively
upwards, as though ho
were endeavouring to
forecast from the look of
the sky whether it would
bea good potato season
or u not. It is a touching
picture, and we have no
doubt it will arouse a fury
of enthusiasm in the
breasts of the Irishmen
about Narrabri. Under
the cornstalks on the Aus-
tralian side of the page
stands a damsel with a
crook under her arm,
herding oysters. That is
what you would put them
down to be at a hasty
UUWUL tu UO Rb a uaooj
glance. But they are not oysters. They are sheep.
This ends the symbolism ot the title-piece. Below
this comes the reading matter—three columns In
green glaring across at three columns in blue, with
a wnite strip between them, to prevent them from
coming to hostilities we suppose. The interior of
the sheet is all in blue. In tact, the preponderance
of this colour wou ! d lead an ill-natured person to
observe that the proprietor entertained but a mel-
ancholy opinion of his prospects. The commence-
ment in green, too, would be suggestive—to a
cynical mind —of his credulity in starting upon
such an enterprise. But we are not persons of this
description. If there is anything gives us real
pleasure, it is to encourage new efforts in journal-
ism. The fourth sheet, however, has a more san-
guine appearance. Three columns are in bronze
and three in scarlet. The delight all this variety
must give to the eye of the reader, we leave you
to imagine. So lar for the artistic part of the pro-
duction. Now lor the literary section. But we
must take another paragraph to describe this.
• * *
We said the proprietor was justified by the
style of his paper in calling It by the proud and
comprehensive title of the Irish and Austhali an
World. Well, if you don’t think so by the
account we have given you of its appearance, we
believe, if you are human, you wih agree with us
when we give you a resume of its news. First,
there is a public meeting about au aboriginal
Secondly, there is a police court case about the same
aboriginal—from both of which we learn his name
was Alick, and nothing more. We are sorry for
this, because we began to get interested in Alick.
The “ General News ” is led off airily with a para-
graph about Upjohn, the ex-hangman. Then come
several sprightly paragraphs in succession, each
individual one of which concerns either an at-
tempted murder, a successful murder, ora suicide.
The last paragraph in this mirth-provoking page
has reference to a Chinaman who was struck by
lightning while cutting cabbages. The most con-
spicuous thing in the two inside pages of the
paper is an invitation (in blue) to “ drink Gunne-
dah beer.” On the fourth page we come suddenly
across the discovery that the gifted printer la a
poet, and a very rampant poet at that. It speaks
libraries for the future of this journal that this
should be so, and that he should make a dead set
at fame in the first issue It would hardly be fair,
now we have told you so much, not to give you a
specimen of his verses. They concern Hanlan and
Beach. We take some lines at random—all are
equally—well, equally equal. Here are four:—
“ So sang the great Hanlan, as o’er the wide ocean
To Australia he wended his way;
His thoughts were of Laycock—he hadn’t a
notion
That Beach was inclined for a say.”
Four more :—
“ Then out spoke Bill Beach with the pluck of a
man,
Saying, “ Deeble, let us to the fore,
We must beat this Yankee lad (that’s if we can),
For he must not be king any more.”
We think that will bo enough. The gifted printer-
poet bears the historic and famous name of O’Con-
nor—a name which has always been as full of
poetry as a potato is full of starch. An article
cheerfully entitled “ A Terrible Tragedy." and
another with the equally airy heading, “ A Cry for
Vengeance to Heaven heard,” with a chatty little
item about a police-sergeant who poisoned his eye
while preserving the head of a stolen bullock,
finishes up the list of Interesting family reading.
What we have told you will let you see what a fine
discriminating eye for what pleases the public the
proprietor of this paper possesses. You can’t tell
him about what is popular fireside reading. He
knows. The real news is cunningly hidden in the
last column. It is a line description of the Treaty
of Limerick, and does great credit to the enter-
prise of the proprietor. From this we learn that
there was a treaty signed at Limerick a short
while back, in 1691, and that it was broken. As we
suppose there will be further particulars in next
issue, wo will not go more into the matter just
now. In fact we only mention it as evidence of a
diaregird for expense in obtaining the latest
newo, which promises to be a chief characteristic
of the Irish and Australian World. And now
we think we have done our little part—even if we
have not broken a bottle of champagne over its
head—in launching the now journal on the (these
dear old drivelling phrases will haunt us till we
die!) stormy seas of Journalism. We will only add
a quotation from the leading article, and then
catalepse for ever. If you have attended to what
we have taken the trouble to tell you, you will re-
member that the paper is printed in four colours,
i ? Vn 6 w J lich m ay well be called the
( eaae mille failtha of races, engraved in a style
which it is not too much to say will be the despair
of art for ages to come, and that the first issue
contains an unrivalled selection of gleefully gorv
anecdotes, the latest news about the Treaty of
Limerick, and a poem by the printer himself,
are P r ®Pared for the quotation,
which is: When our staff are entered on their
work, and each gets into his own place, greater
variety may be confidently expected.” This
finishes us. If greater variety is attempted, we
prophesy that there will be such a ghastly time in
Narrabri as will never be seen again till the
General Resurrection. And so, with asiuh we
waft this brilliant little journal on its way. With
all its glory, we see the hand of death on its brow.
We have seen so many bright and hopeful ven-
tures of the kind perish in their bloom, that we I
Ka® w ma F k - The baby-oolfln is prepared. The

will be glorious. It will go to the tomb with all Us \

be one more issue. We want to hear the rest of
the stpry about the Treaty of Limerick. And then
w ® tbwo can nerve ourselves to part for ever !
with the Irish and Australian Harlequin.
Hurroo! the fight’s beguu and the skin
and hair are beginning to fly already. Greek has
met Greek at last to test who’s made of the sternest
stuff, and most fervently do the bystanders ex-
claim, “ Damn’d be he who first cries Hold,

house Act of 1863, Sir James Martin let out his left
and nearly grassed Sir ’Enry in the first round by
observing from his judicial perch: “This Work-
house act remained a dead letter till my retire-
ment from office, and then a gentleman, who
thought (I suppose) that he could thus cheaply
heap dirt upon my administration, brought in a
Bill to repeal this most salutary Act.” The blow
was skilfully stopped by the Paulconbridge Chic-
ken. however, who, finding the cap fitted him so
neatly, at once replied through the press as foi-
lows;—“ I held office as Colonial Secretary with
Sir James Martin In the Government which car-
ried the Workhouse Act of 1866. I sat beside Sir
James Martin in opposition when the Bill was in-
troduced to repeal the Act. The member of the
Assembly who Introduced and « arried the Bill to
repeal it was the late Mr. 8. C. Brown. It may bo
doubted whether It is worth while to correct these
wanton misrepresentations; but the present is a
characteristic example of the painstaking care of
certain writers In the press to ascertain the facts
on which they Indulge their love of detraction.”
first blood is claimed for the Chicken, but the
friends of the Supreme Court Slasher are very
confident that their man will knock bis opponent
clean out in the next round. However, it is a very
pretty quarrel as it stands at present.
Duelling is still far
from extinct throughout
the length and breadth
of the Continent, from
Stockholm to Naples,
from Moscow to Madrid.
In the palmy days of
Henri Quatie, 3000 gen-
tlemen are computed to
have been slain in single
combat; now-adays, over
6000 duels occur annually
in France alone. In every
French regiment are to be
found two or three first-
rate swordsmen, com-
monly called lies tdteurs,
whose especial business is
to test the nerve of any
recruit suspected of a de-
ficiency of physical cour-
age. In journalism and
society, an almost similar
rule prevails, the weapon
used being the small
sword. The issue of these
encounters is, as a rule,
anything but tragic : a
scratched finger or fore-
arm being quite sufficient
to Justify tbe seconds in
declaring that honour is
satisfied. Occasionally,
when political or other
considerations render
even a scratch undesir-
able, pistols are resorted
to, but with peculiar pre-
cautions. Thus MM. Gam-
betta and De Fourtou—
the former being one-
eyed and the latter nearly
blind—were put up in a
dense fog at forty paces
(the favourite distance of
Bob Acres), to exchange
shots with very short-
barrelled smooth bore pis-
tols. Considering the
highly erratic course
likely to be taken by a
bullet under such circum-
stances, the courage of
their seconds calls for
great commendation. In
»paln and Italy duels
are very frequent ; the
sabre is universally used,
though Italyfor centuries
boasted one of the best
fencing-schools in
Europe. The result is
that, while a fatal issue
is rare, the ugly gashes in
the face, the prospect of
which is said to have so
seriously d 1 s c o n c erted
Fompey’s officers, are
very common. In both
these countries the pen-
alty for duelling, as in
France, is merely nomi-
nal. Throughout Germ-
any, Including Prussia,
Austria, and the minor
States, a very different
rule prevails. The far-
cical “Schlager” duels
between students are
still winked at, but en-
counters between civili-
ans are punished with
considerable severity; the
ordeal of single combat
being aprivilege practic-
ally reserved for the army
Whentwo officers fall out
a regimental court of hon
our decides whether they
should fight, and should
either refuse to abide by
the finding he is dis-
missed the service. Pis-
tols are almost invariably
used, at a distance of
twelve paces; and, Ger-
man officersbeing as a ru le
very good shots, fatal con
sequences are not infre-
quent. In the event of a
fatal issue, the survivor
is liable to suffer a term
of open arrest ;in a fort
ress varying from two to
six months. A German of-
ficer thus finds himself
placed in tbe dilemma
of refusing to fight and
being compelled to retire
or of fighting and run-
ning the risk of being
placed under arrest
for doing so. The
.Russians are very quar-
iiunomuo aio vciy «j utu -
reisome among themselves, and are constantly
fighting duels d la barriere the opponents
being put up at fifteen paces, with liberty
to advance live paces each at a given signal, and
to lire at will. Should one of them lire and miss,
his adversary is entitled to complete his C ve paces
before returning the shot. This is obviously a
very businesslike form of duelling; and many
cases have been known in which a duellist, al-
though mortally wounded, has yet retained suffi-
cient strength to take steady aim and fire with
fatal effect. The great Russian poet, Pushkin, was
killed in a duel d la barriere, after severely wound-
ing his antagonist. In the Baltic Provinces, a sys-
tem prevails which at first sight appears even
more murderous. The adversaries are placed only
three paces apart; the pistols are held with the muz-
zle pointing up wards,and are brought down and dis-
charged at a given signal. It may appear almost
Impossible for two men to miss each other at so
short a distance, but this Is not the case. Each of
the opponents is so desperately anxious to gain the
least fraction of a second on his adversary that,
on the slgnbl being given, the weapons are often
brought down witn so hurried and violent a fork
that the bullets bury themselves in the ground.
At a duel fought last year at Riga, between an
officer and a student, in this fashion, no fewer than
three shots wore exchanged without any result;
while at the fourth discharge the student bad the
great toe ot his right foot cut clean off by bis op-
ponent’s bullet.

Thoughtfulness! Phew! that’s far too
mild a term. We shall call It phenomenal conside-
ration. Last Tuesday week a young man from
the country district of Casterton, drove his buggy
into town for the purpose of bringing home a wife,
but on arrival, the would-be bridegroom found
the impatient lady had forestalled him. Having
met a discarded suitor, and rubbed noses once
again, the fickle fair one married her first love;
but rather than put the disappointed one to any
loss, she generously offered to buy all the furni-
ture he had provided in anticipation of his future
bliss, and furtharmore, she offered him 30s. for the
loan of his trap to do a fly round in honour of her
present glad festivity. But the young man being
of a revengeful nature made use of language that
would sound better In a brewery than in a church,
and driving home burst up his household goods
with a borrowed axe. By and bye the axe will bo

Quite a big boom in a small way was
pulled off at the Greenwich Pier Hotel, Watson’s
Bay, on Thursday last, the occasion being a com-
plimentary picnic given by the genial Dean Flana-
gan to the fair Kelly gang of desperadoes who re-
cently helped him to plunder the people of St.
Peter’s of a cool thousand pounds by means of a
church bazaar. After two hours’ steam round
the harbour, refreshments were served, and a
little speechifying eventuated, the Dean modestly
alluding to hlmseif as the giant oak round which
the tender Ivy (meaning the girls, of course) ‘ most
lovingly did entwine.” No class of persons enjoy
a day"s outing with greater zest than the Catholic
clergy, and, as seven of the crow-pluroaged gentry
out in an appearance at the Flanagan shiyoo, the
fun at times bordered on downright lunacy.
Dancing in the pavilion, getting lost (in select
couples) among the rocks, and such like amuse-
ments, helped to pass a pleasant day and tack a
few years on to the life of the jolly old octogena-
rian Dean of 8t. Peter’s.

15th verse of the 3rd chapter of Revelation, which
runs as follows:—* I know thy works, that thou
art neither cold nor hot.’” “That’s wrong.” re-
plied the doctor, a poppy tint suffusing his ex-
pressive features. "Shall I try you again? said
the professor, suavely. "No, cried the worthy
gentleman, hurriedly leaving, * I can r wait; 1 ve

Sing Kay is dead at last. Who was Sing
Kay ? He was a Chinese prisoner in the Geraldton
Gaol, Geraldton, W.A. Perhaps we should not
have noticed his demise much if it had not been for
the fact that he strove harder to get out of this
world than anyone we have ever known naa striven
I to keep In It. He first tried to hang himself with
the waistband of his trousers. Discovered in the
act. Tried to cut his throat with a piece of glass.
Discovered in the act. rtwallowed a quantity of
broken glass. Not discovered till violent hoemor-
rhage had set in. Waspulled through that. Finally
he was removod to a small ceil where there were
no apparent possible conveniences for shortening
life at discretion. Nothing wasleftbim except his
trousers, shirt, blanket, and coir mattrass. Next
morning he was found hanging dead from a bar
of the cell-window. He had taken his trousers off
and tied them tightly round his neck, and fastened
the trousers to the bar by a piece of rope which he
had manufactured from his mattrass. As the win-
dow of his cell was nearly 8ft. from the ground,
and he was only 5ft. 3in in height, he had to climb
up by placing his feet against the walls on either
side—3ft llin. apart-a piece of gymnastics which
showed he was in good form for the long leap he
took afterwards. Even in the matter of dying, the
yellow heathen displays more perseverance and
ingenuity than the Caucasian.
There is one thing about Alfred we like:
he is open to conviction. Being a careful, earnest,
and, we hope, admiring peruser of these columns,
it has lately dawned upon him that he is not quite
a “ Suffokels ” in point of classical lore, and he has
accordingly chartered a person in reduced circum-
stances, d’une mise negligie, to instruct him in the
lauguage, as spoken by the ancient Greeks, and to
throw a bit of gardening in. For the last three
weeks, behold Alfred, as he travels behind his two
chestnuts, erooning the following edition of
the alphabet:—“Alfred, Beetroot, Gammon,
Belt-her, Asylum, Bat-her, Beat-her, Theatre,
Ironmonger, Capers, Lamb’s-fry, Mews. When
he had collared this portion of the Greek
alphabet, and thrown it with great violence,
he called Davies aside one morning and rehearsed
to him the whole performance. Davies, who had
never heard anything in his life, except about the
circulation of the Down and Gumtkee Jkhnel,
complimented Alfred with almost paralytic em-
phasis upon his newly-acquired accomplishment.
The classical “ scholard,” looking carefully round,
and dismissing for the nonce the art-critic, who
happened to be grinding the ink, said: “ Mark you,
I am not agoin’ to stop here, now I have onoo
begun; and directly I can come across a good
second-hand shovel at a moderate price, I mean to
have a go at the Greek roots.”
Professor Simon, the phrenologist, gave
some profound criticisms on a few of our public
men the other night. For instance, he said that
John Davies was “ ever ready to please—until he
had gained his ends;” that Dan O'Connor was an
“ orator of no mean order—a well-read man—a
good judge of science.” The Professor should
have added “ and of whisky.” We agree with
him that Dan is “an orator of no mean order.
He is of no order. Also that he is “a well-read
man.” He has probably read his own speeches
more frequently than any person alive. Further,
that he is “a good judge of science’ —in the
pugilistic sense. Mr. Htuart is described as * a
profound thinker.” This we have little occasion
to question—his thoughts so seldom come to the
surface. And Mr. M’Elhone, besides being “ free-
and-easy” and “ combative,” has a “ splendid
appetite” “ and is “an excellent judge of animals.
With regard to the latter gift, we all know that
his judgment is only skin-deep. Neat this, eh !
These criticisms ot the Prolessor will, however,
show you what a searching science phrenology is.
Who, we ask you, could have made such discoveries
guided merely by common observation ? It la
well the Professor lives in these tolerant and
enlightened days. If he had shown such superna-
tural sagacity three or four hundred years ago, he
would nave infallibly been burnt as a magician.
If ever an engineer was hoisted as high as
the moon with his own petard, that engineer is the
Archbishop of York. Of late this worthy prelate,
having plenty of time and chalk on his hands, has
been going in bald headed for the driok statistics
of Great Britain? and, after much trouble, he 4is-
covered and declared to the world that the drink
expenditure exceeds the whole rental of the
country. Hardly had he given lip to his wonder-
ful discovery, however, before a certain drinker
wrote to Reynolds’ Newspaper in the following
pungent styleTouching the figures lately given
on the drink cost of the land by the Archbishop of
York, let us take a far smaller sum—say, for in-
stance, the £10,000,000 which he and his fellow-par-
sons appropriate—what would this not do ? It
would pay the school ponce of the whole nation,
it would support all the hospitals. I can imagine
a working m in standing on the silent margin of
the other shore, and looking at the strange con-
course of people pouring into the City Beautiful
from every point of the cwmpass and in every
variety of credal dress. I can imagine him saying,
too, “ Heaven seems easy of access from anywhere
and how so long as a man is sincere, and yet
England pays ten millions a year to have one of
the little lanes thither pointed outl’ ” We venture
to think ,'his Gra e is now exceedingly sorry he
ever spoke, and that he will be mighty glad to im-
mediately change the conversation.
The Rev. Henry Ward Beecher says—and
if he doesn’t know, who does?—“there is some-
thing of the nature of a God in all men.'’ That’s
all right. We have noticed the fact ourselves,
ever since wo touched the too-confiding time-piy-
ment furniture man for a 16-gulnea pier-glass.
But, at the same time, we are forced to say that if
there were a little less of the god, and a little more
of the oyster about some men, the business of the
world would get on much quieter, inasmuch as the
aforesaid men would occasionally keep their
mouths closed. How, for instance, ther -’a the
Rev. Charles Strong, who has just returned to his
old Victorian haunts, and who had barely set his
foot on terra firm a before he began to orate in a
style that doubled up his former enemies in the
Lord worse than if.' a load of hay had fallen slap on
top of them. And amongst other important chat
fired off, we notfioe the Rev. Charley says:—“I
don’t know how it has been with other people, but
I know that I have found on mv return to the
colony, the same kindness, cordiality, and sym-
pathy that I experienced here for many years
before. However cool other people may ha,ve felt
their seats on returning here, I have not felt mine
cool.” All of which leads us to Infer that this un-
fortunate divine has either been taking violent
exercise on a hard-trotting bare-backed horse, or
else ho accidentally sat down in a plate of hot soup
at his recent snontaneous welcome banquet.
Out of the palatial building in Market-
street, the other day, there might have been seen
emerging a man of distinguished mien, in a
shockingly bad hat. It was in the full glow of
noon-day; and his name (we conceal it for obvious
reasons) was . As he reached the corner
he was accosted by an individual with a bulbous
countenance, a fixed eye, and a suit of clothes
which had probably adorned members of the
Press for several generations. “ Sir,” he said,
accosting the journalistic proprietor, “ I am starv-
ing.” A gleam of pleasure from 1 - s optics.
“Starving I” said he; “you’re not, really, are
you?” “I is,” replied the crushed one emphati-
cally. “ Starving 1” cried the Mogul of journalism
with a swing and a genial smile; “ fancy I You ve
received some eddication, I suppose ? * I m a

The Rev. Dodd, of Dunedin, has put a
head on the Hon. Mr. Stout, the free-thinking
Premier of New Zealand. In a recent pulpit con-
vulsion he declared in effect, and in many more
words than we have time to spell out, that the
colony was going fast to the devil since it had
dared to place at the head of its affairs a man who
made it his boast that he did not believe in the
Christian’s God, and who consequently denied his
Saviour. Well, now we only want to say that we
also would like to squeeze a word or two in edge-
ways, and we will put it this way. Suppose that
both the reverent Dodd and the Irreverent Stout
had been in the flesh and able to spout and act
eighteen hundred years ago, Judging from what
we know of them In the pr sent day, on which
side would they be most likely found ? Would not
the Rev. Dodd be conspicuous among the Phari-
sees. And would not the sceptical Stout have
seized a tomahawk or a writ of Habeas Corpus
and rushed to the rescue along with the equally
sceptical and valiant Peter, and slashed off Lord
knows how many long ears before there was time
to put an injunction on his proceedings ? No, Mr.
Dodd—reverend or otherwise-it won’t do at
this time of day. You Just listen. In a
century or so, the chances are when you
find yourself strolling around Paradise hum-
ming the 119th psalm, you’ll come across Stout
trying on a pair of new wings and ready to start
on a celestial tour along with such boon com-
panions as Robert Burns, Tom Paine, Bradlaugh,
and Bob Ingersoll. They will probably make the
grand tour of the Milky-Way. round by Orion,
the Great Bear, past the North Star, and back
again by the Southern Cross. We don’t exactly
know how many myriad billions of miles they’ll
travel; anyhow, they’ll find there’s plenty of room
for more immigrants; and. if there are such places
as Hell and Ireland in the future, they will do
their best to ameliorate the climate of the one, and
get Home Rulei and good seed-potatoes for the
other. And this reminds us that we have quite
forgotten to put out the milk-jug.
Distressful rumours were circulating
through Melbourne during the early part of last
week. The major proportion of the womankind
of that city wore a deep-mourning sort of expres-
sion upon their faces, and went about with a far,
far away look in the eyes. Verdi, their own dear,
dauntless Verdi, was dead. On the journey from
Colombo to Calcutta, the brilliant baritone had
breathed his last, and ’neath the surging sea,
doubtless, the sweeet songster silently slept. So
ran the rumour. For twenty-four hours all
feminine laughter was hus'ied, all gone was girl-
hood’s glee. But at length came an angel-a
Herald angel—with the glad tidings that Verdi
was not dead, and the little birds upon the green-
wood tree recommenced chirping their little lays
much the same as usual.—
That Rumour.
There came the other morning
A whisper wild and warning,
And, like a house in mourning,
The city was a-hushed.
Young damsels, tender-hearted.
With eyes whence tear drops started,
Spoke low of dreams departed.
And hopes for ever crushed.
’Twas sad to hear them mutter
How he the “ too, too utter,”
Had never reached Calcuttar,
But on the journey died ;
The stars, night vigil keeping,
Looked down on maids still weeping
For one who lay a-sleeping
Beneath the moaning tide.
But rumour false averred he
Was dead, for in a word, he —
The one and only Verdi—
Is well and all serene ;
Soft cheeks but lately yellow,
Now blush, while voices mellow.
Ring gaily—Lucky fellow 1

A man named Thomas stole a revolver,
and watch and chain. This was at Armidale.
Then he went and took a pop shot at a man
called Marshall, just to try the revolver. After
that, feeling some twinges of conscience about tne
watch and chain, he called upon a clergyman ana
wished to present him with them, stating at the
same time they were not paid for. The clergy-
man—no, it was the clergyman’s son, we find, on
reading the paragraph again—refused them, mis
touched Mr. Thomas to the heart, and he imme-
diately called round on Archdeacon Ross, ana
asked that successor of the apostles for money to
go to Ulen Innee. Here he met with another re-
fusal. He then said: “Christ would not have re-
fused,” in a tone of bitter scorn, and stalkea
gloomily away. This opens up a curious question-

Chief Justice Li l ley sent an unfortunate
man up for twenty-four hours' stretch last week
for driving a cart p sc the Supreme Court, Bris-
bane, during the sitting, after he had been warned
by the police not to do so. The noise of the
street traffic is not as sweet music to the nicely at-
tuned ear of Sir Charles, and hence there was
trouble for the inconsiderate carter. Which re-
minds us that the late Judge Ball, who waslwell
known on circuit in the South of Ireland, on one
occasion opened the Assize Court in “ Cork’s own
town.” Tue Judge, though a charming conversa-
tionalist and a fine fellow socially, was rather Irrit-
able, and, as he advanced in years, his hearing be-
came slightly Impaired, which did not conduce to
his serenity of temper. Immediately at the back
of the Court House was an ancient flour mill of
large dimensions, the owner being a litigious old
buffer named Bendeeble, and so close was the
building to the temple of justice that the noise of
the machinery grated harshly on the tympanum
of the Judge. “ What noise is that, Mr. Sheriff ?”
he thundered, as his face flushed with badly-sup-
pressed rage. “ It is a mill, my lord,” meekly re-
joined the official. “Then let it be stopped at
once,” was the imperious command. “I cannot
stop it, my lord,” mildly replied the Sheriff; “ the
owner is the only one who can do that.” “Send
for the owner, then,” roared the Judge, which
order was promptly executed. “ Stop that mill,
sir,” said the Irate Judge, addressing old Ben-
deeble. “Throth, I will, your lordship,” was the
reply, and His Honor’s dictum was carried out
literally and unconditionally. The mill was
stopped, and it remained so long after the assizes
were over. Then the litigious old crank, Ben-
deeble, sat himself down and began to figure out
his losses through the s oppage of his grinding
concern, and he tooted up a nice little bill, which
he smilingly handed over to the “base and bloody
Saxon ” tor settlement. And the Government
had to pay a pretty big figure before old Bendeeble
was satisfied. If there isn’t a “ pile ” in it for the
Brisbane carman, there's a moral or something to
be drawn from the legend—but wo forget what it
Is just now.
For a prime piece of newspaper slush,
commend us to a par. in London Society which
says tint, on the occasion of Mrs, Langtry's last
trip to England, a crowd assembled and cheered
her as she alighted at a certain country town,
upon which “a pleasant-looking old lady thrust
her head out of a carriage and said, ‘I’m glad you
like Mrs. Langtry, my friends, because I'm her
mother.”’ We heard something of the sort be-
fore, only, instead of the “pleasant-looking old
lady,” It was a sour-faced man who poked his head
head out of a truck and roared, “Yah I I’m glad
some one likes Mother Langtry, but damme It I
do. I’m her husband.” And this reminds us that
the much-talked-of Langtry-Gebhard marriage
will be certainly pulled off before Easter. All that
stands in the lover’s way at the present date
is the obnoxious Mr. Langtry. This gentle-
man, It appears, parted from his wife some
three years ago, and no communication between
the tangled pair has taken place until lately,
when a friend of the family interviewed the
happy husband and broached the subject of a
clvorce. Langtry gripped the trouble very coolly
and observed, “ Certainly, let there be a divorce.
But 1 must be the plaintiff.” It was explained to
him that this would be next to impossible to ac-
complish. His wife would never consent to act in
the position of defendant la such a suit, for she
would have to bear all the odium. “ Then let her
remain married until my death,” said Mr. Lang-
try; and he added, “ I am a pretty healthy man.”
Since then, however, compassion, or revenge, or
greed, has led him to believe that perhaps it would
be better for the Langtrys to permanently separ-
ate. How it will be for Freddy when the gilt
wears off his gingerbread is not related; but, any-
way, the male Langtry now declares he will not
oppose any a tion the missus may take, providing
she does it decently. As if she could possibly do
anything that was not decent. Joy filled the Lily’s
alabaster “ buzzum ” when this declaration was
first made; but rumour says that on learning Mr.
Langtry’s principal reason for release from the
marriage yolk was in order that he might catch on
to a new partner, the Lily went bucking mad, and
swore that the heartlessuess and deceit of the men
now-a-days was enough to bring a blush of shame
even to the saddle-coloured cheek of one of the
mummied Pharoabs.
Here he is again. John Brook, late of the
1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, and a man who
“fit” at Waterloo, has just died at Stratford Grove,
Putney. No one has been appointed as yet to take
his place In the ranks of the immortal and never-
ending list of Waterloo veterans, but there is
little danger of the post being vacant long. John
Brook was something more than a “skiter” of
Waterloo, however, for he was born in 1797, and
entered the 1st Foot Guards at Halifax in 1811. He
then went out with the army to Hollanl, and
served tnrough the campaigns of 1813-14-15; was
present in the action of Merxem, the bombard-
ment of Antwerp, and the battles of Quatre Bras
and Waterloo. In the last engagement, his knap-
sack was shot from his back with a cannon-ball,
which killed several comrades close to him. He
was present at the funeral of Geonre IV., the
coronation and funeral of William IV., and the
coronation of Queen Victoria. After over 27 years
of service with the Guards, he applied for his dis-
charge, and received the medal for long service
and good conduct. On the memorable 10th of
April, 1848, he had the charge of five divisions of
special constables under Viscount Chelsea. In
1851, through the influence of the Duke of Buo-
cleuch, he was appointed a Yeoman of Her Ma-
jesty’s Koyal Body Guard, In which capacity he
wag present on many State ceremonies, including
the marriages of the Princess Royal and the Prince
of Wales. And apropos of this, a veteran of the
wars of Napoleon has Just turned up in Montreal
in the person of one Count Zowasti, a native of
the fair land of Poland, of “ Bohemian Girl” cele-
brity. According to his own chat, Zowaaki is 93
rears old, and ha claims to have served under the
Little Corporal, and to have been Captain of the
101st Light Artillery. He went through the terrible
retreat from Moscow, the brilliant oattle of Aus-
terlitz, and the fatal Waterloo, and recalls the
scenes and incidents of each in a wonderfully clear
manner. He took part in the Polish war for inde-
oendence in 1831; fought in Hungary, and was
banished to America in 1851. He was also a parti-
cipant in the American Civil War, since which time
he has led a wandering life, and was seeking meaas
In Montreal to enable him to reach France, where
he has friends. We right glad to have tumbled
over old because, owing to the constant
perusal of obituary notices of Waterloo heroes,
we were rapidly growing into the belief that the
whole of the men who fought on that bloody field
belonged to the Duke of Wellington’s army solely.
We presume the bulk of our readers have
heard of “ The Last of the Tasmanians.” Well,
to-day we regret having to announce that ha’s
dead—dead as Julius Cnesar—and, what is still
more deplorable, he has been dead quite a number
of years already. Time was when the last of the
Tasmanians, like the veteran wno fought at
Waterloo, used to die on an average about once a
w«ek, but the thing grew monotonous, and the
Tasmanian Government shut down on the game
by declaring that n > more “ lasts ” would be re-
cognised when the present holder of the long ago
belt, one Fanny Smith, shuffl-d off her mortal coil
and went to visit her friends in the happy hunting
grounds of the Great Hereafter. Poor Bonwlck,
who wrote a book called “ The Last of the Tas-
manians,” was badly cut up when Fanny was re-
surrected, as she placed his hero clean out of the
show altogether; but it now appears that Fanny
herself is only a saddleHCOloured fraud and
Bonwiok’s hero really was the very lastest of
the “ last,” after all. Anyway, a certain Spaniard,
peter O’Reilly by came, of Port Cygnet, Tasmania,
writes to say that the last aboriginal Inhabitant of
Tasmania was Truganlnl, who stepped out on the
orn May, 1876. Furtheroiore, Peter declares that
ranny Smith is only a half-caste; she says
so herself, and asserts that her father was
one of the Straits “sealers.” When, in 1847,
the Government decided to remove the few
aboriginals left from the island to the
main Ian.:, Fanny accompanied her mother, who
rejoiced in the name of Tangurootoord — simply
that and nothing more—to th> station at Oyster
Cove, and there she remained till a member ot the
irrepressible tribe of Smith—with an “1”—came
along and towed her into the happy oort of wed-
!?rnu Among other things, Signor O'Reilly savs,
ihere is in the Port Cygnet township a man who
resided on the Oyster Cove station all the time
the blacks were there, and he often assured me
that Mrs. Smith was always regarded as a half-
caste. I have known her for nearly six years. She
resides within three miles of here. The cross of
blood Is unmistakeable. Her children, too, are
fairer than the ordinary Spaniard. It is true, the
Government gave her a grant of 300 acres of land,
and a pension of £50 a year during her life; but
this may be accounted for on other grounds than
the fact of her being a real aboriginal.” Persons
who have tears for the defunct Tasmanians, there-
fore, better shed them now, as It is no use wasting
time and moisture by waiting to spill them over
the grave of a half-bred duffer like Mrs. Smith.
We don t often weep for the fading away of our
unbleached friends, but when we do, it Is a satis-
faction to know we have turned our lachrymal
taps on the right grave. Anyway, lovers of the
romantic will be delighted to know that the de-
tested smiths are not going to fill every niche of
honour In the land, but that one little spot at least
will be reserved for the party who bore the far
more euphonious name ot Truganlnl.
Commenting on the release of the Claim-
ant, Reynolds Newspaper (par excellence the
paper of the British people ) says:—” During his
lengthy term of Imprisonment, the Claimant be-
haved in an exemplary manner, and what is more,
perhaps, to the point, nearly every one of the
Government officials, who have closely and inces-
santly watched him for years, are thoroughly con-
vinced that If he is not the real Sir Roger Tlch-
borne, he is certainly not Arthur Orton. To this
latter conclusion we ourse'ves arrived long before
the trial which ended in his conviction was termi-
nated. We had many opportunities of personal
communication with him. We narrowly scruti-
nized his every word, gesture, and action, and
could after this arrive at no other opinion than
that a person of evidently good and gentio breed-
ing, and whose manners had not been spoilt by the
roughness of colonial life, was certainly not the
rude and coarse Wapplng butcher, Arthur Orton.
Perhaps the strongest evidence la favour of his
being the real Sir Roger Is the conviction In the
minds of those who were most intimate with the
young baronet that the Claimant Is the veritable
person ne represents himself to be. The late Lord
Rivers, a thorough man of the world, and about
the most unlikely person to be sharped by an im-
postor, (irmly believed In the Claimant to the last,
and his purse was always open to assist him. It is
the same with Mr. Quartermaine East, Mr. Bld-
dulpb, and many others who were very loth to
believe in the Claimant’s assertion, until his ac-
curacy had been tested in every possible way. The
Claimant was, moreover, singularly unfortunate
in many ways, His earlier counsel, Sergeant Bal-
lantine, being quite unequal to the conducting a
case of such magnitude, and requiring so much
attention and research, made a sad bungle of the
whole business. Dr, Kenealy struggled nobly an 1
resolutely to overcome the difficulty that faced
him In having to plead his cause before a judge
who had long since prejudged it against him.
Lord Chief Justice Cockbum was about the most
self-opinionated and wrong-headed Judge that
ever eat upon the bench. It was well known that
before he had taken his seat in court for the Tich-
borne trial his lordship had frequently pronounced
the Claimant a rank Impostor. Cockburn was
about the last man to admit that he could possibly
be mistaken. His conduct throughout the trial,
and the tone of his summing up, displayed the
strongest and most virulent partisanship. Then
there was the almost incredible story told by Jean
Lule of having, in a passing ship, rescued the
Claimant from the wreck of the Bella. This story
was utterly discredited; and, perhaps, very pro-
perly so, on its being shown that Luie was a
notorious and convicted impostor, just fresh from
Chatham Gaol, where he had been undergoing a
lengthy term of imprisonment. But It must also
be remembered that the Claimant himself never
recognised Luie, and when they first met distinctly
stated he had no knowledge of his person or recol-
lection of the circumstances ho mentioned. There
were many other strong points In the Claimant's
favour, all of which, however, the Lord Chief Jus-
tice failed to deal fairly with In his charge to the
Jury.”
A few days ago, the Freeman’s Journal
unintentionally did a brace of honest. Industrious
men a gross injustice, and It happened thusly.
Copying from an Irish weekly of the reliable
Bvenooze stamp, the Freeman, after delicately
referring to the fact that the late not very much
lamented Alderman James Carey’s family were at
present engaged in the laudable purpose of drink-
ing themselves to death, observed: “ We may also
mention that M’Keown and M‘Bneny. the two
printers upon whose evidence Michael Fagan was
hanged, received not only £300 each from the Eng-
lish Government, but were provided with passages
and outfits to Australia, and are supposed to be
employed in one of the official printing offices in
one of the colonies.” We have taken some pains
to bottom the facts of this case, and the result Is
wa find the men in question are now employed in I
the Sydney Morning Herald office as oomposi- I
tors; they have been over twelve months In the
said situations, and their character and work have
given every satisfaction to their employers. Their
connection with the notorious Joe Brady case came
about in this wise. Both men were on the staff of
the Nation at the time of the Burke-Cavendish
murders, and were on their way home through
Phoenix Park, half-an-hour after the assassins’
knives had done their hellish work. With the
stamp-pickers was a “Casile” soldier, and, as the
trio crossed the Park, M’Eneny, seeing Fagan,
whom he knew, sang out, “HelloI Mick; what
are you after here?” " Qoln’ home,” replied
Mick, and right there the conversation ended. A
year after, Mick went home via the gallows-tree.
Neither M'Keown nor M’Eneny thought anything
further of meeting Fagan, until the Carey disclo-
sures were made, and then the two comps, were
forcibly made to appear and give evidence against
Fagan. Both of them refused point blank to say
a word until Judge O’Brien threatened them witn
twelve months’ imprisonment. About six weeks
before the trial they threw up their billets on the
Nation, and arranged to clear out for America
rather than be classed in the same list as Carey.
Being seized on board the steamer, however, they
were placed under the special surveillance of
a detective, who guarded them night and day.
When the case was closed they claimed £30 only
as compensation for their loss of time, &c., but
the Crown insisted on their taking £60. Looking
round for a suitable boat to sail In, they accident-
ally struck the Pathan, and were three days at
sea before they were aware of the choice com-
panions they had on board. Strange to say, one
of the first men they met on landing here was the
very detective (now a member of the city police)
who in former days had his “ heaslo heye” upon
them. Being smart, sober workmen, they were
taken on the Herald staff at once, and naturally
enough they feel aggrieved at the foul insiauatiou
oast upon them. Apropos of this, we may mention
that a strong suspicion is now current amongst the
Fenian brotherhood that, the mysterious No. 1 Is
no other than an agent of the British Government,
the object of his game being to bring universal
odium ou the Fenian cause. A base inoiuuation,
uo doubt, but then, as H-tinier says. “There are
more things in heaven and earth, &c/’
Dan must certainly be slain. We have
temporised with this conviction too long. We
have been generous even to feebleness with his
foibles. But wo are exhausted at last. There is
an end to all things. And there must be a rapid
end to Dan. We do not object to his remains
obtaining Christian burial—say, in Dean Sheridan’s
hat. But be must die. That is beyond argument.
It is not cruelty to him, but the common Instinct
of self-preservation, which makes us say this. For
if Dan lives, we shall die. His picnic speeches will
Kill us. Tnd while he lives he will make picnic
speeches. But, you may ask, why read them ? We
cannot say. They have a fatal basilisk-like attrac-
tlon for us. When we take up a paper they are the
first things that catch our ey©. W© know our
danger, and wa struggle as well as we can to avoid
it. We read even thing else, oven to the patent-
medicine advertisements, before we look at, them.
But as an absimhe-drinker, who knows that he is
drinking liquid death, dallies with every other
kind of liquor as long as he can, yat finds himself
dragged b an invisible fiend to the baneful
draught so wo with the speeches of Dan. They
have a morbid attraction for us, which we
cannot conquer. Therefore, we say again, he
must be seen upon the surface of this globe
no more. Two or three sentences from his
speech at the late Eight-Hours’ Dinner will,
maybe, make you think as we do. He was
presented with an address. In replying, he re-
ferred to “ the priceless address which your chair-
man has just presented to me in a speech of singu-
lar power, sweetened by the tone of its exalted
liberality. And. with regard to his endeavour to
become “a worthy citizen of a free State,” he
said, ‘ How I have succeeded, this gathering, in
very sweet and dulcet tones, fells to-night.” It is
this saccharine oratory—this treacly talk—which
is slowly killing us. We wonder the flies do not
settle oq th© man when h© is spe iking. One©
™ore, referring to the address, he remarked,
Should I lose my place in public life, what a lofty
sense of consolation I shall find in this beautiful
and touching address.” Extract the two most
salient sentences from this “priceless ” and “ beau-
tiful and touching” production: “ More especially
was this—(support of the eight-hour principle)—
manifested when our brothers and co-workers
from Victoria. Queensland, and New Zealand
attended our demonstration of this year. You,
with splendid and truly British generosity, enter-
tained them at a picnic, by which the beauties of
the harbour of Sydney were viewed, and, at the
same time, the bodily comferls were lavishly
attended to during our memorable visit to Chow-
der Bay.” We consider these to be very
solid and practical sentiments, but Dan, look-
ing at them through his glorified glasses,
sees that they are “priceless” and “beautiful”
and “ touching.” It is his poetry, perhaps, but if
these are all that he says they are, then what ad-
jectives are left for a bill of fare ? And certainly
we will admit that we have known times when a
bill of fare has been more delightful reading to us
than lyric or idyl. But, thanks to (the good god-
dess Fortune, these occasions are becoming rarer.
However, this is trilling. We extract for you from
the same speech a string of mysterious sentences
which are no doubt pregnant with meaning If we
could but grasp it. They have danced a demoniac
dance in our brain ever since we read them, and
we want to try If we can—like Mark Twain with
theryhmeof the railroad-porter—get rid of them
by transferring them to you. Thus Dan “ Watch
well the unscrupulous demagogue who tries to
manufacture a grievance, or who endeavours to
disentomb prejudices, in order to obtain power
and position. Avoid liquors. They are nearly all
composed of the worst spirits in the community.
With all my soul I abhor those social and political
plague spots. I believe only In appealing to the
justice of the people.” Evidently there is some-
thing crooked here. If not, the remark that liquors
are “ nearly all composed of the worst spirits iu the
community” and that they are “ social and politi-
cal plague spots”—mark the political I—is nam
enough for a nursery. What is all this pap and
syrup) about, auyhow ? But there Is no use in
asking vain questions at this time of day. We
come back to the Inexorable dictum—Dan must
die.

“The Claimant ” has threatened the Times
with a libel action I.... Fifty-eight oflicers and men
sat down this year to the annual Balaclava dinner.
General Sir E. Cooper Hodge presided, and the Bari
of Lucan, whose blundering caused all the trouble,
was present —“ Thank God ” is repeated about 50
times in ‘Chinese” Gordon’s most recontly-pub-
llsnu'd letters. Gordon is as pious as Holy William
....Lieutenant Ludovisi, an Italian, who slapped
and insulted a brother officer, and shot him dead
in the duel which ensued, was tried by court-mar-
tial for the former offence and condemned to two
years’ military reclusion and the forfeiture of his
commissiou. The court-martial took no cog-
nisance of the duel; for whilst the penal code re-
gards duelling as a crime, though a very venial
one, the regulations of the Italian army compel an
officer to fight with any one who insults or chal-
lenges him, on pain of expulsion from the army.
....Henry Somerville, 1 the English dramatic
reader, who has Just died, aged 73, could recite
from memory the whole of Shakespeare and
Dickens, together with over one hundred selec-
tions from Hood, Thackeray, and other popular
writers....“General” Booth, we read, has of late
himself donned the red jersey which is now so
familiar as an article of attire at Salvationist
meetings. He has just sent one “Major” Smith
to America, “to ruin the devil.”.... An American
journalist, whose description is delightfully accur-
ate, says that the face of Edmund Yates reminds
him of an old-fashioned coffee-pot—narrow at the
top and broad below.

He will as follows moan;—
“ O, Molly Jones, 0, Molly Jones,

A-raking among dead men’s bones,

“ O, Molly Jones, my fate Is dark!
That I should find thee thus,

My grief shall not be mute
Beneath your window I will stand

Wet with the tears I’ve shed—
And when I meet your fancy bloke

ORIENTAL GOLD
Is the latest discovery of Science and the grandest
achievement of the alchemist’s art. It looks like
gold, It is as heavy as gold, and it is more enduring.
None but an expert can detect the difference, and
then only by the severcstltests. Ornaments made
from this new composition are equal in design and
general appearance to .those made of the finest
18-carat gold, and yet we sell them at but a tithe
ofjthe Cost of the genulne goods.
Remember that we do not pretend that Oriental
Gold is anything but a composition of pure metals;
but we do affirm that it is so perfect an imitation
of the sterling gold as to almost defy detection.
Jewellery made of it may be worn anywhere, and
the closest inspection will only strengthen the con-
viction that it is real gold. So perfect is it, and so
large has our trade become, that Jewellers through-
out the colonies are complaining of the dullness in
trade, and are constantly writing to us to secure
our goods for their own customers. But as we are
Sole Agents for these colonies, wo prefer to deal
directly with the public. All of our Oriental Gold
Jewellery is made to our order, and is stamped
with our trade mark. You can order anything
from a Scarf Pin to a Watch and Chain, and it will
be tent Post Free, and at our risk, on receipt of
price.

Here we are again! A merry Xmas to you
all I And It may be as well to mention that an ex-
ceedingly beautiful display—pleasing to the eye,
and artistic In its varied conception—is the exhi-
bition of majolica ware, vases. &o., and electro-
plated ware, at Bray Bros, 408 and 404 Qeorge-
street, near King-street.*
Probably no exhibition of Christmas cards
in Sydney has ever met with such enthusiastic
admiration and patronage os has been accorded
the beautiful display now to be seen at Puller’s,
385 and 387 George-street. Almost every conceiv-
able variety of design and form is on view, so that
even a bare enumeration is out ef the ques ion.
The visitor is perplexed and bewildered at the
very outset by the multiplicity of pretty nlonacks
heaped together or scattered in studied confusion
over long counters. Altogether, It is a very pleas-
ing and edifying sight. Here, in a few, broad,
sweeping lines, full of boauty, is a gelatine card,
hand-painted; while there rests on an easel a
lovely tinted card with heavy fringe, ornamented
by a few appropriate lines in old English text.
The beautiful in art is everywhere visible.
For harmony and delicacy of tint, for rich-
ness in colouring, for graceful treatment of
seasonable subjects, this exhibition is replete, and
must be seen to be appreciated. It would bo Im-
possible to catalogue all the pretty things to be
seen, and the general impression of the visitor is
that his admiration is more than likely to effect
his peace of mind, unless he purchase enough to
go round all his relatives and friends. There is an
endless diversity in the desivns—there are liand-
painted cards, etchings, water-colour drawings on
lino paper, and some very simple, tasteful devices
Inlaid on wood,besides other kinds of various shapes
and sizes, too numerous to mention, too intricate
to describe. The names of the makers are a suffi-
cient guarantee as to quality, the list including
all the best English and Continental firms—
not to mention the celebrated American house,
L. Prang and Co. Of the English, perhaps
the finest selections are from Marcus Ward,
Raphael Tuck, Eyre and Spottlswoodo, Schlpper
Bros., Delarue, Goodall, Saunders; in fact, every
one of the first-class manufacturers is here repre-
sented. There are not only thousands of cards of
all degrees, but in the matter of prices, all classes
may be suited; for the figures, which are remark-
ably moderate and reasonable, are from a half-
penny up into the guineas, and afford great scope
to choose from. The prices are adapted to the
person moderately circumstanced, as well as to the
more fortunate possessor of the world’s goous.
That the rooms are constantly thronged oy ladles
In quest of tokens for the holidays is enough in it-
self to recommend the exhibition—and that each
leaves the establishment with one or more neatly-
wrapped packages speaks well for the character
of the goods on sale.*

SUNDRY SHOWS.
Theatre ROTA.b—“ Never Too Late to Mend."p 8
Opera House—" Bobadil ” in.
GaietyTheatuk— Montague-Turner Opera.. ib.
Thursday night saw a dense and swelter-
ing house at the Royal. It was Mr. Goodman’s
benefit, and must have supplied him with a tidy
dot for his daughter (if he has one), unless he
wastes it in riotous living beforeshe comes of age.
Two volunteers (Myra Kemble and Mr. Rainford)
set the ball rolling with “The Happy Pair”—a
lively trifle entitled a "sparkling comedietta” by
the bills. It Is the old story of wedded slang-
whanging succeeded by entire confidence—differ-
ing, In this respect, from the experiences of Lord
Lytton and others. It contains a useful moral,
too. for it shows the tendency of men to sit upon
their wives, if the latter will suffer themselves to
be sat upon. There were some neat speeches,
which were made the most of, and some bizarre
situations which were not. Of course, the whole
thing is a wild improbability. Any young man
who could go through half an hour of it without
reducing his wife to pulp and cremating her In the
kitchen range, could never hope to come to any-
thing above driving a furniture-van or filling a
post in the Lands Department. “Hold your
tongue,” howled the mari. “That’s not in the
marriage service,” snapped madatne, in a manner
suggesting that it made little difference whether it
was or not. And Myra’s re-appearance brought
back a crowd of old remembrances—Collins-street,
the United Service Club hostelry, pere Trump,
turning circus. Ah! ces beaux jours—ces beaux
Jours.

“ The Royal Pardon” followed. It con-
tained a person who possessed many of the cardinal
virtues, being a tender husband, a fond father, a
perfect gentleman, and a publican. It Is seldom
that a man of this description reaches the age of
30 without passing through a term of penal servi-
tude This fact alone makes us long for the com-
ing of that social revolution which cannot be put
off much longer. Conscientious men have no more
chance to-day than they had 10J years ago, when
thousands of them were shipped from England to
New South Wales for “put-up” jobs. So this
Paul Markham (Mr. Holloway) is “ lumbered ’ for
life for Just tossing an old sea captain (Mr. Leake)
over a cliff, having previously removed the best
pari of his head with an adze to keep the fall from
hurting him. There is very little real liberty in a
country where a respectable man is liable to be
seized by the minions of an effete tyranny for such
an action. We have known retired sea captains
from our infancy—have listened to their weird
blasphemy and inspired mendacity. And we
contend that hitting them on the head with a hoe
and chucking them over a precipice, in the absence
of a shaft, is not only the truest humanity to them,
but a duty which society owes to its law-abiding
citizens.
• * *
Of course Paul Markham had no hand in
the mai iner’s retirement. It was one Joseph Mill-
bank (Mr. Charles Brown) who secured the old
sailor’s money, and then with Paul’s ad*e sent the
owner into his Maker’s presence to explain his
share In some black-birding among the Islands.
We took to this Joseph Mlllbank at once. He ap-
peared to us the true type of a scoundrel—not one
of those hairy, loud-voiced, demonstrative ruf-
fians, with frowsy beards, doubtful linen, and
murderous weapons; but a quiet, unassuming
rascal, who robs, murders, convicts another of the
crimes, marries the convict’s wife, and settles
down into a life of well-earned content and re-
spectability. He was bowled out in the long run ?
No doubt. But think of the gorgeous time he had
before his luck turned 1 Panov marrying the wife
of the man you've lagged 1 How common-place
and vulgar the so-called pleasures of an ordinary
life in comparison!
• • •
OMr. Dampier occupied a large share of the
canvas. It is mainly through him that Mlllbank
comes to grief. He is in turn a “ orunken school-
master” with rheumy eyes, a crushed trage-
dian” frequently playing Hamlet, but never
twice In the same place without an interval of
some years between each appearance, and a
“ speculative Frenchman.” As the schoolmaster,
Mr Dampier succeeded in inducing his face to
assume a look of more hopeless imbecility, more
abiect idiotcy, than we thought possible to be
contained in a space so limited. He drinks be-
cause he likes it-so different from those mean
“s wipers” who greedily guzzle while protesting
all the time that they dislike it. As Helen Mark-
ham. the convict’s wife, Miss Novaro succeeded
in securing attention to a rather small part. Miss
Dampier made the most (which is saying little) of
A mv Castleton ; while as Peggy. Miss Merton
showed a capacity for getting rid of objectionable
persons which is of the greatest service to ladies
employed about publ o-houses. As Jonas Grim-
wood ta deformed boatman), the make-up of Mr.
Jones was—remarkable. About Mr. Holloway s
(the hero’s) fate, your mind was set at rest after
the first act. You felt that the man who could
sit a hen-coop through the Bay of Biscay, and
enjoy it, was not one to go under without know-
ing why ; so that when he came up the st-aight,
shot nast the winning post, recovered his faithful
but sorely tr^ d wife, wiped the tears from his
affectionate che-i-ld’s eyes and obtained a fresh
lease of his “ pub.,” the general verdict was that It
w“ ne m re than he deserved, after the quantity
oLsusplclous “ hominy ” he had vanquished in fair
fight. * « • •
“Max-liana” and the “Bohemian Girl” car-
ried tho Turners over the first 5 nights of the week.
The absence of Signor William Green was sorely
felt in both, and during “Happy moments.” and

twice she sat on Don Jose’s (Mr. Turner’s) knee,
and more frequently on the corner of a four-
legged table. On each occasion an apprehensive
cloud passed over the faces of the timid and re-
spectable among the audience; hut the feeling
wore off after a bit, when the word went round
that the table was of cast-iron, and that Charles
had had two pounds of underdone steak and a
quart of stout before the overture started. It
would be as well If these facts, trivial as they ap-
pear, were In future circulated, on proper autho-
rity, among the people before the rising of the
curtain. Nothing, however slight, should be
omitted by caterers for the public amusement to
set their patrons at their ease.
• •
Mr. Turner’s Don Jose was spirited and
melodious, Mr. Brennlr (specially engaged)
struggled successfully with Escamillo. It was
chiefly through his warbling In this part that
Signor Verdi (ni Green) had to hire a brewer’s vat
to contain the billets sent to him by tho Gwendo-
lines, Euphrosynes, and Haideos of St. Kilda,
Toorak, and Woollahra. Two private secretaries
also wore kept going day and night reading and
responding to tho amorous invitations sent to the
brave Toreador to sport with Amaryllis in the
shade and take the kinks out of what’s-her-name’s
hair. [No wonder all Melbourne took to crape
when the news of the Signnor’s death (happily
unfounded) arrived—the women because ho died at
all, the men because he lived so long,—Ed. B.]
Yes. To a powerful baritone with certain physi-
cal perfections the world offers many seductions
denied to the Murrumbidgee Whaler and the Pope.
Well, this yere Brennir has a voice of very pleas-
ing timbre, and when he’d engaged and thrown
the Toreador’s song an encore unemphasized with
projectiles was the result But his success as a
Toreador appeared to be confined altogether to
Spanish bulls. How he would come off in a sin-
gle-handed set-to with a Celtic representative of
this useful breed it would be hazardous to say.
• • ■
Dancairo and Retnendado (Messrs. John-,
son and England) were the funny men, and you
felt that, underlying their “wholesome fun,”
there was a deep tank of potential Thuggism,
which was always on tap. Cut-throats by choice
and profession, they had about them all tho
mingled frowsiness and dignity of their ancient
calling. If the warriors of Philip even remotely
resembled them, it was, perhaps, just as well they
never landed in England. They were not called
upon to sing much, but the quantity of “gulver ”
they had to work through before the final full of
the curtain set them at liberty to satisfy a rather
protracted fast, was phenomenal. The English
libretto, as we said, is a joint production, ana a—
polished one. Still, these bandits had weak points.
They are unaccountably weak in offensive wea-
pons. True, each one carries a brace of horse-
pistols of apparently large calibre and antique
pattern. At least the stocks of those murderous
weapons obtrusively protrude from their girdles,
but you cannot shake off the suspicion that there
are no barrels attached—that the latter are away
on more important duty, possibly assisting in keep-
ing Tipperary rents low enough to enable strug-
gling men to live.
• • *
Having seen Charles as a Spanish dragoon,
one feels consumed with a desire to see his horse.
We suppose it is too late to secure a megatherium
for a night or two, but now that the British are
nearing Khartoum, there should be no insuperable
obstacle to securing a hippopotamus, or tailing
that, a rhinoceros. As Zuniga, Mr Gordon had a
not very trying part, which was, no doubt, agree-
able to him. besides relieving the audience of some
anxiety. Of Mesdames Lome, Lambert, and Har-
per, we have little chance of saying much this
time, but will give them a show shortly. Miss
Lambert, by the way, carries a tambourine, and
Miss Montague performs the same office for a pair
of castanets. Taken all through, neither the Tur-
ners nor tho public have much cause of complaint
with the season so far.
• • • •
“ Bobadil ” continues at the Opera House,
but the pace is telling on it; and if its friends are
at all concerned for its future, they will have
“extreme unction” administered without any
vexatious delay. The patrons are becoming fewer
and more apathetic. Th s might be partly, but not
wholly, put down to the weather. Still the pro-
prietors have no reason to regret their venture.
It has had a success very rarely accorded to works
of a young writer in a comparatively small city.
We have more than once expressed our opinion of
it, and so further comment upon it or its repre-
sentation would possess neither value nor enter-
tainment.

A “grandrevival” of CharlesReade’s “It’s
Never Too Late to Mend,” keeps most of the
“ Royal ” seats still unoccupied. There is now
little chance of a real revival taking place in this
popular theatre this side of the Christmas Panto-
mime.


PEPPER AND SALT.
Two horses were killed by lightning at
Parramatta last week. We have noticed it as a
curious feature in the characters of some horses
that they Will run in the way of the lightning.
But that is merely an observation in natural his-
tory thrown out by the way. Several horses and
cattle were also killed by a cyclone up in the
Northern districts. It is said that the police there
telegraphed down to Sydney for the cyclone to be
arrested as soon as it arrived. We believe it is
still at large.
• • •
A gentleman of Burrowa said, at a ban-
quet held the other evening in that holiday town-
ship, “ that, when he first arrived in the district, it
was quite a treat to see a female, and a man would
go several miles to see one.” Quite likely, and
the rule holds good still. We would, from what
we remember of them, go several miles to see a
Burrowa girl at any time—at least, to see her feet.
But this is flippant and, what is worse, ill-natured.
There would be no necessity to go several miles to
see the feet of an average Burrowa girl. You
could see them before you saw the girl. We are
going up to Burrowa soon. This is why we take
the opportunity of previously ingratiating our-
selves with the fair sex of the place. What sly
dogs we are I

A correspondent to the Nooze gives a

The Mayor of Wellington, N.Z., says of
the City Council that it is “ the most diabolicaj
Council that ever met.” If he wishes to remain in
this opinion, he should never leave New Zealand-
If he came here, we could show him Councils-ah,
what Councils could we not show him ? Councils
where the Mayor has to preside over the proceed-
ings with a club, and has to hire two Corporation
men to see him safely home. Why, we know
Councils in which an alderman has to bo roped 4n,
or gagged, and sat down upon by the whole body
of his fellows, who threaten him with bludgeons,
before he will consent to become Mayor. The
Mayor of Wellington may, in comparison, con-
sider himself a happy man.

Says the Evening News:— “A curious
reptile, with two heads and measuring 13 inches
in length, was recently killed by a Chinaman at
Binalong.” This is altogether too thin. And,
more than that, it is ra?an. We know very we’l
that two-headed snakes and fiery-eyed dogs with
bristled hair are seen only by News and Rum re-
porters. It is all very well, after wrestling with
the darkness all night and praying for the morn-
ing, to fill up witn whisky as soon as the first
hotel opens, and then walk down to the office, ar-
tificially brave, and make a flippant paragraph of
your previous terrors. But it is not fair to con-
nect them with a Chinaman. And always reflect
sweet reporters, if it is a fearful thing for you to
see two-headed snakes, what it must be for the
snakes to see you I

The Inspector of Nuisances for Darlington
was somewhat roughly used by the wigged wags
of the Redfern Court lately. It appears that, in
an ecstasy of zeal, he had summoned several citi-
zens for not attending to the sanitary regulations
of the suburb. But in one of the cases he met a
crusher. Says the local paper:—**There was over-
whelming evidence against him that the drain re-
ferred to ran up-hill, and the verdict went with
the balance of testimony.” The laws of nature, it
would seem, came off as badly as the Inspector.
They had little chance against a suburban Bench
of Magistrates. We shall not be surprised to hear
soon that it will be flneable for a man to publicly
deny in the streets of Redfern that the earth is
flaf. The magistrates will, no doubt, judge of it
by their heads. Averse:—
Now, we would ask these ancient heads,
That wear the civic crown:
How much of whisky must fly up

Babbage’s celebrated old, calculating,
machine was good, but after all there's nothing in
the way of arithmetical spryness that can possibly
come up to the average hotel-waiter. Calling for
his bill recently, our Continental correspondent
was honoured by a most unctuous smile from the
John Davies-looking party in attendance, who
glibly observed: “ Billsir — yessir—soupsir-one
shilling—chop, one shilling—that makes two-an’-
sii—cheese ?—no cheese, sir. Three shillings.
Thank you, sir, much obliged. And, pardon me
for observing, sir, that I receive no salary here sim-
ply trust to the generosity of our patrons. Thank
you, sir—this will help me to relieve the dying
wants of an aged parent. The other gentleman
who has charge of your hat will, I am sure, be glad
to see you also.” These are the men whom our
all-wise Age ts-General class as desirable immi-
grants and ship down here to swell the ranks of
suburban aldermen.

Herberton is a happy place. It is yet in
that rude and vigorous young age when there are
no class distinctions and no differences of degree
such as there are in older towns. There your only
aristocrat and leader of men is the gentleman who
can empty the greatest number of pewters before
being mixed with the table-legs. Even the religion
of the place is of a rough and unassuming kind,
which tolerates everything but ceremony—or, as
the natives more succinctly express it, “b y
side.” There is a genial mixture of the sacred and
the profane, which, although it astonishes 8
stranger, is earnest enough in its way, and answers
all the requirements of the Herberton spiritual
ideal. For instance, the Oddfellows of the place
had a procession 5n last Prince of Wales’ Birthday.
Two men marched in front, one carrying a Bible,
the other a highly-ornamented billiard-cue. After
these came two others, one of whom bore a sword f
the other a tin tomahawk. Nobody saw any in-
congruity in this collocation of emblems. On the
contrary, everybody was much impressed by the
pageant—everybody, except one man who wrote
to a paper published in a town at a distance, ex-
pressing some doubt as to the propriety of the ar-
rangement. His friends have heard nothing of
A Case In Feint, but not a Pointer in the Case.


him since. It Is not always discreet to trifle with
the holiest feelings of men who take their liquors
straight—and often.

There is a man in Bourke who is now
praying for rain with more vigour than all the
churches put together. Does he want it to ferti-
lise the country and make the young lambs skip
like hilN ? (It gives a tone to the paper to have a
Scriptural reference now and then.) Not much.
Does he want It to fill his tank ? No. What then ?
Well, he Is a storekeeper, and he entertained a
green and secret envy against another storekeeper
(a most uncommon thing, by the way). So, there
being an auction sale held some time ago, he
attended and did bidjagalnst his rival, who finally
collapsed. The result was that the conqueror
found him self in the possession of seventeen
dozen of umbrellas. That is why he Is praying
for rain. He is not particular how much begets.
He is willing to take a new Deluge on time pay-
ment. But he wants to sell those umbrellas.

The Norfolk Islanders and Pitcairn Is-
landers have led a happy, idyllic life-cheered
with psalm-singing and whale oil—up to the
present time. Now, all that happiness is to be
wrecked. Those who would like to see these Ar-
cadian islanders In their last days of primitive and
peaceful Joy had better start at once. The Colo-
nial Treasurer has bought 100 copies of Judge
M‘Farland’s book, “ The Mutiny in the Bounty,”
and is going to send them out to the two doomed
islands. The seafarer passing them a few years
hence will see a few rows of little green graves,
with, perhaps, one or two emaciated creatures still
alive sitting each on a grave and gibbering Idiotic-
ally over the pages of the fearful volume. We
don’t blame Judge M’Farland. He had to write
something, we suppose, and we suppose also that
he couldn’t write It any differently. But we blame
the Colonial Treasurer. He should have read the
book before ruthlessly resolving to devastate two
quiet and far-off Islands with It. The Inhabitants
never did him any harm. We shall think less of
the humanity of Mr. Dibbs in future.

The Redfern Times defends Bishop Barry
against a correspondent who accuses His Lordship
of violating the fourth commandment (is It the
fourth ?) by employing his servant to drive him to
church on a Sunday. It says:— 11 We cannot follow
your corollary that because Wesley walked it, and
bush missionaries tramp It, Bishop Barry, under
different circumstances, should do the same. This
is the nineteenth century.” If it were not for the
flighty tone of the police reports in this influential
joi rnal, we should not hesitate to suspecr that
Bishop Barry edited it himself. And yet he may.
for all that. Who knows but the police reports
are written by the deacons? It looks dubious,
however you take it. Still, we cannot deny the
statement that this is the nineteenth century,
more especially as it reminds us that Christ has
been dead Just eighteen hundred and fifty-two
years come next Good Friday. The original assets
of the religion have therefore had all this time to
accumulate by compound interest and judic'ous
speculations among the heathen. We give In.
His successors have every right to Increase their
expenditure according to their Income. We are
only surprised that they are so moderate. If we
were in the position of Bishop Barry, we think we
should go to church on an elephant—or perhaps
two elephants, it it pleased us. And with regard
to the ridiculous argument about the employment
of a servant on the Sabbath, used by the obscure
heretic who wrote to the Redfern Times, we
should like to ask him does not the servant drive
to church ? And Is not that the proper place to go
on a Sunday ? Also does he not take the horses
there ? And Is there no salvation for horses ? If
there is not, hell will be full of newspaper corre-
spondents. We are glad to see that Bishop Barry
takes such a determined stand in his influential
organ. But we wish he would tell the office deacon
to gum the wrapper better when .he sends us a
copy in future.

A recent Evennooze states that a “ Wil-
liam-street poet” has “broken out,” but with
customary brevity neglects to say what place it
was he broke out of. From the style of verse
produced by the escapee, we should imagine that
it la in Darllnghurst that his “ little empty cradle”
stands, but the sentiment is redolent of Tarban
Creek. But, can it be that this is only a misprint,
and that Alfred is indebted to a “ William goat”
for the copy ? We shudder to think of the fate of
that goat, if he should happen to bring up more
copy when three or four of his literary brethren
are lingering on the stairs, for, assuredly, a tra-
gedy, compared with which the Mignonette affair
would sink to utter nothingness, would then ensue
to dim the glory of Alfred’s entrance Into the new
premises. Oh, nnd this reminds us: Alfred says
“Gussy”:—
“ His parting bow to Sydney soon he’ll make,
Nor second term of office will he take;
What, what has caused our Gus. to change his
views ?
They say, because he read the Evening News.”
What do we think of this ? We think
“ They ” truly say our Guv’nor changed his views
And yearned to go when first he saw the News. ’
Nor do we think this strange, for had he seen
This vesper catalogue of things unclean.
When first he came, not even for one day
Could he have been prevailed upon to stay.
We love him not, we willingly confess,
But yet wo love the Scavenger still less;
Without much grief to him we’ll say*adlcu,
And wish the Alfred would but clear out, too.

The Guelphs are becoming quite a literary
family. Her Majesty wrote a book some time
ago which did more to increase Republicanism in
England than all the writings of the Socialist
agitators. And now the so s of the Prince of
Wales have wiitten another book in two volumes
all about what they saw in Australia and other
places called at on their cruise. Poor things!
They have unwittingly put another nail in the
coffin of their hereditary dignity. If the me rubers
of this family ot geniuses could only be Induced
to write a book each there would be no need of a
political revolution to upset the throne. The in-
dignant readers would soon settle that.

A Tumberumba correspondent to an
Adelong paper has found a “curiosity” out his

Says the Mudgee Independent One
of the greatest sins a man can commit In Sydney

exhibition would develop into an assault case.
Even if the policeman used a pile-driver, the laws
of his country would Justify him under such cir-
cumstances. The human stomach Is not made

Five years have now elapsed since this great
national enterprise was inaugurated by the ad-
vertiser.
Prior to his advent into the metropolis, the great
and good custom of exchanging CHRISTMAS
GREETINGS by means of these art souvenirs was
almost a thing of nought. Now it is one of the
most popular national pleasantries.
Of course, other smaller houses have followed
in the wake of FULLER’S EXHIBITION, and
copied his ideas and so forth; but this is quite
legitimate; the smaller follow the greater, and it
is one of the characteristics of a broad mind to be
liberal and to impart instruction, and hence Fuller
can rejoice to benefit his weaker co-tradesmen.
FOR THE YEAR 1884.
Words more than the circumscribed bounds of
our English language are sought to describe the
enrapturing loveliness of the cards Fuller presents
to public view, »nd one sighs for the embracing
and complete comprehensiveness of classic lore to
half portray their attractions.

magnificence, splendour, and art combine
to spellbind the critic. Prices from 2?. to
4 guineas.
No. 2.—FULLER’S SCENTED SACHETS.—The
gorgeous elaborateness (toned down by the
sweet tints of the painter's brush) which
weds the fascinating delicacies of this
year’s productions, renders them quite too
Irresistible. Prices from 6d. to 25s.
No. 3.—FULLER’S PLUSH SERIES—A wonder-
ful advance has been made on last year. The
tints, the hues, the multiform elaborations
which enter into their manufacture, must
enchant the fair and the gay alike. Prices
from Is. to 10s. each.
No. 4.—FULLER'S FRINGED SERIES.-New em-
bellishments In the fringes, and a better
character of card, have added a new beauty
to these, which must command the market.

facturer; lovely in design, bright in tint,
original and uniqueiu conception, and alto-
gether worthy of Australia.
No 13.—FULLER’S LITHOGRAPHIC SERIES —
This series is so endless in design, so ex-
haustless in pattern, so multitudinous in
size and shape, so innumerable in subject,
so world-wide in production, that I do not
propose to say a word about them. They
can only be appreciated if they are seen.
There are white and black, blue and green,
red and crimson, yellow and puce, pink and
purple, brown and mottled, golden and
silvered, grey and green, and, and—in re-
lief, in cameo, in etchings, in engravings
and in everything. Prices, from 3s, a gross
to ;Js. (id. each. Millions and millions and
millions.
The above brief description of some of ray
exhibition series this year is worthy of note, and I
confidently submit it to public favour, assuring my
readers that if the world can “turn out” cards,
and has done it, then PULLHE’S EXHIBITION is
the place to see them. If you do not see all you
want or what you want in lo oking round the hall
ask to see others. All cannot be exhibited at
once.

UP IN A BALLOON.—A STRANGE STORY.
“ Ma, is that man going up to Heaven ?” said a
beautiful blue-eyed little girl who stood near the
balloon at Prince Alfred Park last Saturday. “ Oh.
no, pet. The balloon Is tied, and will be pulled
back again.” Little Nell, innocently: “'Will he go
to Heaven if I should out the rope ?” Ma confused,
and not knowing how to answer the child; but, on
reflection, said they would not be allowed to go in.
“Why, mamma, only angels are allowed, then?
What are angels; are they like us ?” “ Oh, no, my
child I Angels have wings and fly.” "I wonder if
you and I and papa will get there and fly.” “ I
hope so.” “ Don’t you think that man In the bal-
loon will get up there? Just see, mamma, he Is
going up alive. What has he got In that basket ?
I know It must be something good. Just see how
he smiles. Watch his llos; he can’t keep them
still. I bet it’s lovely. It’s going up with him.
Let me go and see what it is ?” The dear little
angol peeped into the aeronaut’s car, and then ran
back to its mother delighted, her face full of Joy,
and with that child-like innocence looked into its
mother’s face, and said: “ Mamma, he will get into
Heaven; he has the Anheusar Busch St. Louis
Lager Beer in his basket. Won’t papa be pleased ?”♦
A household perfume. Every family able
to apprecate and enjoy the pleasure afforded by a
really healthful and delicious perfume, should
tupply themselves with the genuine Murray and
Lantnan’s Florida Water. It is the most delightful
and most lasting of all fragrant waters.
Kissing the Wrong Girl.—It is dark.
He steals up to the garden gate. “ My own sweet I”
“ My dearest own!” Then the nole of kissing.
“Speak in whispers, dearest; the old man is not
la tied yet.” " And do you love me? ’ “Do I love
you? I love you wfth a strengtn that would
knock Sullivan out in one round.” “These stolen
meeiligs are so lovely! Don t you think so?”
More kissing. Then a voice from the bouse,
*' Mar> I Ma-ry I” “ I m coming, ma’am.” There is
a rapturous parting Then the young man, as he
steals off, soliloquises, “ ‘ Mary I’ I guess 1 made a
mstake. That’s the servant girl’s name. But it s
my own fault; I oueht to have worn my splendid-
flttlng £3 3e. suit, made by Summerfleld and Co.,

SPORTING AND ATHLBTIC MEMS.
At latest, Fred Archer had won 215 races
out of 500 mounts.
Professor W. Miller was left £1500 by his
father—at least, so we saw in a New Zealand paper.
Donald Dmnie, in the Australasian,
offers to make a mixed wrestling match with Can-
non or any other man.
Two locals, Bourke and Agnew, ran 150
yards for £30, at West Maitland, on Saturday last.
Bourke won by some seven yards.
The Victorian Rowing Association have
no objection to Tasmania sending a crew for the
Intercolonial Eight-oar race, but they will not
undertake to visit Tasmania in return.
The match—if such it can be called—be-
tween the University and Carlingford Elevens
came to a conclusion on Saturday last, ’Varsity
winning by an innings and 151 runs to spare.
Mick Nathan states both his hands are
hors de combat, but in six or twelve months he
hopes to have them sulticiently patched up to meet
anything of his weight in the world. Good for you,
Mickey!
At Adelaide Oval, on Saturday week, G.
Giifen, of the Australian Eleven plaved for Nor-
wood against Kensington, and ran together 309
(not out) out of 398 for five wickets. Kensington
made only 90.
Tom Malone must indeed be a wonder if
he makes even decent time in the alleged attempt
to break the quarter record at the Agricultural
Soon ty’s ground on the 27th. To attempt record-
breaking on such an execrable track is a perfect
farce.
Mr. Cyril Kingsley assures us he stood on
his head on two bicycles at ids recent show. We
hasten to correct our error, if such it be, but no
doubt our reporter was a bit mixed when he saw
Mr K standing on his head, notwithstanding that
he was engaged on his feat.
The untutored Hindoo is acquiring a real
Norman taste for sport. For a “ last-to-win ’*
pony race, stakes sixteen rupees, at an up-oountry
race meeting, nine enteeed. Objections were
lodged against tho winner, a# It was found that be
had squared all the other eight.
It is evidently no use sending over a
second-class sculler to bring baok the amateur
championship of Bananaland. Mr. J. O. Trirubie
was easily defeated iu thu wager boat race at the
recent Brisbane Regatta by Mr. Uhlmann, a local
man. Brett had better go over next time and
make things.even.
Bays Loudon Bell's Life, iu speaking of
W. G. George, the crack runner—*' He will be pre-
sented by the Lady Mayoress, on behalf of the
L.A.C., with a gold medal, on which the various
records made by him at Stamford Bridge during
the present season will be engraved. George
leaves England for Australia in the early part of
next month.”
At the Brisbane regatta, held on Dec. 10th,
the champion four-oar race was won by the Com-
mercial Club of Brisbane by two lengths, with
Brisbane Rowing Club second and the Rockhamp-
ton crew third, the Maryborough crew, who neld
the championship, being last. The Maryborough
crew won the race for the senior fours, beating
the Rockhampton, Brisbane, and Commercial
crews.
Some time since the patch of ground lying
between the Association Cricket Ground and tho
Rifle Range was handed over to the military men
for the purpose of forming a cricket ground. A
considerable sum of money was expended in the
formation of wieaets, and several matches were
played on it while ithe novelty lasted, but latterly
the place has resumed its primitive appearance.
Who is responslbleior this waste of the needful ?
We get this from the Irfsh and Austra-
lian Harlequin —a new jou.rnal to which we
have made a brief reference lot another column
“ It is time preparations were being made for the
reception of the English crio keters at Narrabri.
Subscriptions to defray expenses will be recieved
(sic) by Mr. Upjohn.” This looks ominous for the
cricketers. We make no furt her comment. This
is merely a small sporting item. There is an
elegiac poet on our establishq tent.
Au old gentleman of 70, named Tegetmeir,
Writes to an English sporting paper, saying (in op-
position to the doctors) that the more he rides a
tricyle the more vigorous he feels. The septua-
genarian adds: ‘‘I ride fairly long distances con-
stantly, and can assure my i readers that I have
never suffered, at least to m y knowledge, from
‘hypochondria, hysteria, gaai tralgia, agaraphobia,
or claustrophobia,’ and that even * neurasthenic
dyspet sia is practically uuil uowu to me. Last
year I rode 10,050 miles.”
Says a New Zealand paper: — “David
Livingstone, t he well-known ,long-distance runner,
who defeated »‘Connor reo entiy in Newcastle,
New South Wales, ran ten ml lea witliin the nour
at Invercargill, on Nov. 22. on the track of tho
Southland > k cdouian Society . The attendance of
tho public was very small. LI vingstone completed
his task, and kept faith n it.h the spectators,
running the distance in 5s°c, ffe aid not ap-
pear to be distressed. He did tbe first three miles
in 15m, The Society, In view of the small attend-
ance, agreed to forego the charge for the use of
the grounds.
We bav- heard a probable meeting talked
abo t between an ex-champion light-weight
amateur boxer, of England, and a Sydney middle-
weight, for a trophy. Should the Britisher feel
eager for the fray, we do not fancy the Sydneyite
would be at all oackward In coming forward. Wo
should like to the affair eventuate, just to
show what chance our man would have with an
English boxer, whose reputation should make up
for the bit of weight he would have to give away.
So far as we are concerned, we have an idea the
Sydney man we refer to Is fit to box any amateur
the world can produce under 11 st. weight.
The inclusion of C. Bannerrnan in the
Intercolonial team looks like a huge joke. On their
first try the committee appointed by the Assoclar
tiou selected twenty players to practice, Banner-
man’s name not being amongst the number; but,
at the final selection, we find him figuring amongst
the chosen ones. Why is this thus ? Biannerman
had no practice from the time of selecting the
twenty until the final picking of the team, and we
must acknowledge we are curious enough to ask
the cause of their extraordinary change of opinion.
Charley has seen his day, and we think It la time
he stood aside for younger and better men.
Poor as the contest for the Gardiner Chal-
lenge Cup will no doubt prove.lt is a pity It should
clash with tha Mercantile handicap skiff race, on
Saturday next. The entries and weights for the
latter event are:—D. Fletcher feather, W. G. Brett
631b, F. J. Bull 231b, first heat; tbe second: C. H.
Williams331b, Q. Merson 91b, H. B. Nowell 91b; and
third: G. Seale 481b, W, F. Corbett 391b, E. S. Deane
91b. 631b Is a big lump of weight to hump along,
but fit and well George Brett should win the han-
dicap In a canter. We think the handioappers
should have fixed upon a much higher impost for
the top weight. With (say) Brett at 751b, they
could have worked down with a chance of giving
the lesser lights a show.
It seems Tommy Kelly has deeided not to
lend his aid in the preparation of Beach for the
champion’s coming races. Tommy certainly
brought his man to the post very fit for the Han-
lan race, but if Kelly was sincere la his remarks
to the D.T. man when he stated that Beach was
seated too high In his boat, much against his
(Kelly’s) Idea, we fancy it Is as well for Beach that
Kelly has decided not to accompany him, as In our
opinion Beach would completely throw away his
chance If he made the alt' ration Kelly said he had
frequently urged upon him. But,after all, Tommy
may have only been “poking borak” at the D.T.
man. We have heard that Messenger Is to go up
the river with Beach, and we consider the choice
a wise one. Messenger Is second to none in fixing
a man up, and would be able to go out on the water
with his charge.
The Qlebeites must be an easy-going
crowd to pass the boat Frazer pulled in the Junior
race, on Saturday last. Leaving the dimensions of
the craft out of the question, she is fitted with
outriggers, and, although the swivels may not be
a couple of Inches outside the boat, it Is the thin
edge of the wedge, and should be put down with
an Iron hand, for If two Inches be allowed It Is hard
to say where the limit is to be drawn. Durrell,
the local representative, and the only man who
covered the course without In one way or another
deserving disqualification, should have protested
against Frazer a boat, if only on the principle of
the thing. It seems extraordinary that the boat
we refer to could have been lying for hours on the
Glebe Bowing Club's stage without the locals
noticing the way she Is fitted up. No boat carry-
ing swivels outside her gunwale should be passed
as a “club skiff.’’
Says London World:—With everybody, of
high and low degree, rushing off to the Tom Tid-
dler’s ground of America, It is not surprising that
Hutchens, the [fleetest runner England, and pro-
bably the whole world, has ever known, has
wended his way thither, the only mystery being
why he did not do so before. ’There boxers of the
lowest type may make small fortunes; so surely
such a wonder as Hutchens ought to reap a golden
reward. In America the running of 100 yards In
lOseo, Is a feat accomplished by amateurs with ap-
parently less difficulty than In England ; so, as
Hutchens can probably give any American ama-
teur a start of five yards In the distance, he should
give us an astounding record, say He has
already done something very nearly as marvellous
as this, for he has covered 300 yards in 30seo. ex-
actly, this being, of course, at the rate of 100 yards
In lOseo. for the whole distance.
Our pig-skin straddlers are evidently In a
bad way, and a howl of lamentation is heard on
the happy training grounds. Two serious epi-
demics have settled down on our jocks, and in two
cases the complaint has proved fatal. Tom Hales
has been a martyr to asthma for years, and now
Mick O’Brien, the last Victorian Derby winner’s
pilot, is laid up with a bad attack of the same
complaint. By far the most terrible plague, how-
ever, Is the matrimonial fever, which carried off
Bricky Colley not long ago, and which has Just
numbered amongst Its victims poor Paddy Pigott.
Paddy was turned off last week, and Is now lying
iu state at his new training stables at Hotnam
Hill. Jimmy Ashworth, we believe, has also
shown symptoms of the dread disease, and, ru-
mour says, will shortly steer a Colllngwood heiress
to the bridal goal. A slight nuptial rash has also
broken out on Donald Nicholson, but it is thought
that an opening diet and change of air will
speedily wipe away the trouble.
Several of the rowing clubs will be heavy
losers by the “modern exodus” from the Lands
and Survey Department. A very fair four-oared
crew are booked for Maitland—Messrs. Bremerand
Oxley from tbe S.R.C., H. E. Wilkinson from the
M.H.C., and Fitzpatrick from the N.8.R.C.—which
looks as If tbe Civil Service will rule the roast
In Maitland rowing circles. The Meroantiles will
lose their captain in the person of Mr. Wilkinson,
and the Glebeites suffer the same fate by reason
of Mr. lokerson’s removal to Moree, where the
genial Al. will, if all else fails in tbe aquatic line,
be enabled to paddle his own canoe in the sweat or
his brow. Mr. Capper, 8. tt.C, removes his house-
holy gods to Glen Innes, to which paradise Mr.
Michael—we beg pardon—Vincent Murphy is also
told off. But perhaps the greatest loss to aquatic
and athletic circles will be Mr. L. G. J. Bennett,
who goes to Dubbo. Mr. D. D. Middleton, the out-
rigger puller and champion mller, escaped by the
skin of bis teeth, and is to remain in Sydney.
We are sadly afraid the future of the
gymnastic club, started under the directorship of
Mr. Garraway—a gentleman, by the way, whose
name is unknown to us in Sydney athletic circles—
does not show the promise such a desirable insti-
tution deserves. The high rate of subscription we
believe to be the trouble. Jb’6 per annum will
prove prohibitive to the very class such a course
of gymnastics, carried out in a Judicious manner,
would prove of most benefit, our growing young-
sters just taking to the desk or a profession.
The gymnasium, or rather the vault under the
church In Llverpool-street, is Ill-ventilated, is not
large or lofty enough to allow of sufficient scope
for the paraphernalia, and Is as unsuited to be
under a church, as the church Is to be over a gym-
nastic and boxing club. The charge in D’Har
court’s time was twenty shillings a year, and we
have heard several of his old pupils state they o
not feel inclined to jump to £6 for the same i -
struction and appliances. Maybe the tone of the
promoters may be like the subscription—a shade
too high. But, be this at It may. we feel assured
that as soon as the novelty of the affair works off,
it will be found necessary to lower the sub, or
close the show.
We understand Matterson is about to take
a lengthened spell Irora match pulling. The
Claieooe Bi-erlad has thickened out oo siderably
since his maiden effort on the Parramatta, and
should he take anything like the rest he requires,
wo shall expect him to figure as a 13-st. man
In his next contest. We understand Matterson
has on the board a trip to tbe tight little island
Tasmania, where ho will no doubt pack on tbe
beef to a considerable extent Matterson is in
age about six months the wrong lae of 30, stands
5 feet II in Height, and weighs as he stanus some-
thing under 13 st and a half. With a good rest.
and an Improvement In his swing, Matterson may
[ bear out the promising prognostications made by
the sporting scribblers wnen he made his debut, or
rather after he had won a couple of races on
metropolitan waters ; for if we remember aright,
we were tne only paper to notice him favourably
after his defeat of Nicholls. although we did not
attempt to put the iad off his head by at once
Jumping to the conclusion lie would straightaway
rush his way to the championship. While wishing
the promising sculler every success, we are afraid
be will have to go through a lengthy apprentice-
ship before he reaches—should he ever do so—the
pinnacle of his aspirations.
The Glebe Rowing Club regatta came off
in Johnson’s Bay, and if we except the want of
punctuality in sending the races away, the day
passed off without a hitch. A stiff north-easter
blew during the afternoon, which completely de-
moralised the scullers in the open race for Juniors,
in which event the starters were N.8.B C,, J, Con-
nolly; S.R.C. 8, A. Tiley; B.E.C. A., Frazer; and
G. W. Durrell represented the local club. Con-
nolly at once showed to the front with a command-
ing load, but owing to hia wretched steering, Tiley,
who was piloted by hia clubmen in a four-pair, led
when nearing the turning buoy. When close to
the flag, the wind took command of Tiley, and
blew him inside the buoy. Connolly and Durrell
fouled when rounding, and Frazer passed them and
chased Tiley home to the winning-post. Tiley was
disqualified, and Frazer was awarded the prize-
more owing to the hard luck of his opponents than
to his own efforts. This is the second race in which
we have seen Connolly throw away his chance by
bad steering. The maiden double-sculls fell to
Flannery and Maitland, who rowed In very fair
form; Smith and Falrweather made rather an easy
win of the senior double-sculls; the maiden-fours
fell to Curnow, Young, Elphlnstone, and Farran,
after a ding-dong race from start to finish with J.
Cox, G. L. Macroady, C. M’Gregor, and L. Cook-
burn; and the trial-fours, which brought the sport
to a conclusion, fell easy prey to W. Wilson, P.
Maitland, A, lokerson, and F. C. Williams.
One good point about pedestrians is that
you never—well, that is to say, providing you are
very deaf—you hardly ever hear of them being
connected with anything shady In the way of
sport. And this reminds us that A. E. Bird, the
crack long-distance sprinter, who visited Australia
with TopTey and 81ms Beeves Frank Hewett, has
been living for some time past in Tasmania, where
he has fattened up proper by following the (esthe-
tic profession of a fish hawker. Quite a downy
bird, too, is this master Albert Edward. At the
Hobart Athletic sports recently, Bird was allowed
to enter, and some sportsmen took him In band,
paid his lodging s in Hobart, and provided him
with other necessaries to give him another ohanoe
He repaid his friends by telling them that he oould
win the three events entered for, and that they
could back him at any odds and to any extent.
The days of the sports he came on to the ground,
refused to start for the first event entered
tered for, and in the second, after running a short
distance, ran off the course laughing. He was
disqualified for ever by the committee, and next
day started for Sydney on the quiet. Bird had been
heavily backed, and some very Interesting rumours
are afloat regarding the position of those who are
suspected of having “got at” the long-winded
one. However, he will be quite an acquisition
over here, and the sporting public would do well
to rally up and welcome him with—a ton of bricks.
Alf. Greenfield is the latest pug. who looks
for death or glory at the hands ot the champion
slogger, Sullivan. Greenfield has been Invited
over to the States by that enterprising newspaper
proprietor, Richard K. Fox, who guarantees tnat
the “purse” for which this “international fight”
is to be fought shall be worth at least £1000 and
throws out mysterious hints that it may be as good
as £3000, Greenfield is, Immediately upon his ar-
rival, to formally challenge Sullivan, who will
thus (says Mr. Fox) be driven into the position
either of accepting the challemre or of putting
down his flag as the champion ot the world. Ar-
rangements will be made for the battle to take
place In Louisiana, within easy distance of New
Orleans. After the contest with Sullivan has
taken place, Greenfield, it still alive and vic-
torious, will be ready to fight Charles Mitchell for
a purse of probably £3000. In any case, Fox will
back Greenfield in whatever contests he may
enter. Knlfton, an English pro. who dubs himself
“Champion of England,” stated throunh the news-
papers that he would like to have a shy at Green-
field, or, falling that, to back Massey, a man Knif-
ton had recently defeated; to which Greenfield
replied that previous engagements would prevent
him accepting Mr. Knlfton's kind offer, but that if
Knlfton would only go out to America he (Green-
field) would bind himself to fight him anywhere,
anywhen, and anyhow. “ In the meantime,” says
Greenfield, with scathing irony, “I would advise
him to have a little more practice with lads I
will try to teach him what a man can do with him.”
Knlfton’s reply was both personal and autobio-
graphical. He traversed moat of Greenfield’s
statements, and Informed him that he (Knlfton) Is
6ft. Sin. high and Hst. In weight; that he has
offered to run and Jump any Hat. man in the
wond; that he has defeated a Hst. amateur cham-
pion, Queensberry rules, for endurance and 50
1 guineas; .that he baa never been defeated in a
match; and that he is open to box any man in the
world, any stylo. Tne corollary fo these propo-
sitions is that Greenfield should try and take down
Knlfton's number before engaging with Sullivan.
To this end, Knlfton declares that he will pay his
own expenses to New York, and will then box
Greenfield for £100, Just to show the American
public what he can do.
It is notorious that racing men have al-
ways been blind believers in luck, and that, like
the men of Athens, against whom St. Paul uplifted
his parable upon Mars Hill, “they are in all things
too superstitious.” When the still-living mother
of the Duke of Westminster remonstrated with
Lord George Bentwick as to the name which he
had given to his flying filly, Crucifix, his lordship,
according to a story frequently told by old John
Day, the trainer and rider of the winner of the
Two Thousand, One Thousand, and Oaks, in 1840,
replied that if he changed his mare’s Cname he
might also change her luck. Lord Cllfden, the
owner of Surplice, had a lucky cravat, and unless
he wore it round bis neck he had no faith in bis
ability to pull off a big stake. One of the moat
fortunate hits ever made by what the author of
“The Chaunt of Achilles” calls a “spring cap-
tain," who is, I believe, still alive, was upon the
occasion of Ellington’s Derby, in 1856. The young
officer in question was desperately in need 01 £1000,
and upon the night before the Derby he was walk-
ing along Piccadilly between the ends of Arling-
ton-street and 8t. James’-street, It wanted but a
few minutes to midnight, and, gazing upwards, his
eye fell upon the word “ Ellington ” blazing be-
fore him at the t ip of an illuminated clock. There
was a door leading out of Piecadllly into the Wel-
lington Restaurant, which stood upon the site now
occupied by the Devonshire Club, and as the hand
of the clock suspended above this door approached
midnight, it covered the first letter of the word
“ Wellington.” Accepting the hint, the captain
went down to Epsom next day, and took 1000 to 60
about Ellington, the winner. A similar story is
told about a sporting butcher, who, as he drove
down to the Derby, in 1839, was stopped upon
Westminster Bridge—then a very different struc-
ture from what it is now—by a crowd of carts.
Provoked beyond endurance by the delay, he
drove right at one of the obstructive vehicles in
his way, and, vowing that he would indict its
driver, strained his eyes to discover the name and
address painted on the shaft. All that he could
decipher was the word Bloomsbury, which haunted
him all the way until he reached the Downs. The
butcher was a dashing speculator, and, according
to Mr. George Tattvrsall. the author of “ The Pic-
torial Gallery of English Race-horses,” he backed
Mr. Hidsda'e’s Bloomsbury, who started at 30 to 1,
to win £12 000.

The old holy bourgeois “ pride-that-apes-

Providence, a rich, prosperous, and pious mer-
chant, has been slightly overdone, and has called
into existence this kind of thing:—” Flve-and-
twenty years ago a poor friendless girl read in the
papers, on which she had spent her last sixpence,
that the Queen had been graciously pleas d to
send her customary bounty of three pounds to the
mother of triplets. She swore to herself that one
day she would receive the .same guerdon, and,

drop, “lam that girl.” “Five-and-twenty years

SOCIAL
A birthday ball was given to a number of
his friends on the 13th by Mr. E. D. Tollemache,
well known as the manager of the Comnaguoni
Coffee Palace Catering Company. About 150 were
present at the ball, which was held at West’s
Rooms, and Mr. Tollemache received his guests,
as well as the expression of their good wishes, as
they entered the door. Dancing began at 9, and
as the night was warm, the ample space available
was much appreciated. The programme was a
very chaste little affair in white, blue, and gold,
each one bearing a different device. Eight waltzes
were down, and eight other dances, added to
which were a few extras, and good music was
provided by the band in the corner. A few fond
couples could generally be seen in the conserva-
tory, who found their low voices music enough
for all immediate purposes. It was quite ex-
cusable, considering the heat; and it was rather
agreeable to watch the others, A married lady’s
pink dress was exceptionally handsome ; so was
a cream spotted net, nicely fitted and suiting its
fair wearer. Two sisters, one in white and one in
black, drew a good share of notice. A neat little
dancer was Miss Rainford, and a petite lady in
heliotrope moire was both pretty and piquant.
Mrs. Henden graced the floor in black. One
costume was most peculiar in style ; the
fabric was cream and blue Madras lace, but
the contour was of that primitive shape so much
in favour with the msthetic section a short while
ago. The hair of the young lady—who, by the
way, was both pretty and interesting—was quite
moppy, and must have been done that way so as
to be in keeping with the rest of toilette. Yet,
Though her hair was rough, she was nice enough,
And most undeniably sweet;
And that cream and blue, though simple, it’s tiue,
Just suited that fair aesthete.
But as dresses to-dav shoot out such a way.
As worn by our gay Hite ,
It is fair to observe that an absence of curve
Seemed to render her inccmpleto.
Among the gentlemen present were Messrs.
Kahlo, J. Hardie, W. Targett, M.P., Mr. Inspector
Anderson, Mr. J. H. Rainford, Mr. G. Coleman of
the Gaiety Theatre, Mr, Henden, the aeronaut. &o.
The supper tables were spread in a way seldom
equalled, every delicacy being supplied, and the
run on the strawberries and cream did credit to
the ladies' appetites. During the night, Mr. Fred.
Gannon mom ted a chair, and, in a short speech,
proposed their host’s health, Mr. Tollemache re-
plying in a style even briefer still. The ball was a
very pleasant one, and the more so because it was
not drawn out to a fatiguing length.

For many years it has been the custom to
have a juvenile ball at Nithsdsle every December,
and the ball marking the close of the classes for
this year was hold last week. Two hundred were
present. There Is something essentially pretty In
the Bight of children in fancy dross; In their un-
affected enjoyment they forgot to be stiff as their
elders often are, and the quaintness of old-
fashioned attire, find the precocity of Infant
noblemen, or the occasional glimpse of a little
bhildish, perhaps pardonable, pride, are all ele-
ments of Interest to those who stand aside and
•:eSP the harvest of a quiet eye. On Tuesday night
•reek, then, the rooms, with a host of extra deco-
rations, flowers, and flashing lights, looked their
gayest ah the bail opened with a polonaise march.
Mrs. Bentley and Mr. Herman played the music,
and the evolutions as all marched round gave a
chance to have a good view of the dresses. After-
wards, the usual programme proceeded, and both
rooms wore tilled with dancers, while from boudoir
and conservatory parents and friends looked on.
V ery handsome looked Miss Zlotkowski as Stella in
"Tambour Major,” and her short dress of white
with blue facings was chastely pretty. Her sister
Miss Adrienne, took the character of Lurline.
The tiniest girl was little Olive Taylor, of Balmain,
os a Fairy: just one of those mites that you see
step out of a pie-melon in a pantomime, a fluffy
hall of tulle, sparkles and wings. Her sister,
Daisy, Was in pipk, and Miss Dolly quite a load-
stone for lovelorn youths in white satin. A Ger-
man Peasant was well personated by a visitor
from North Shore. A voung lady was nicely
quaint in a cream Mother Hubbard skirt—only with
«v tinge of that variety which since the days of Kvo
has characterised one sex, she couldn’t make up
her mind to bo entirely plain and old-fashioned,
so she wont to the cupboard and got some bits of
cardinal which were artfully dotted around her
dear shoulders. Three small daughters of Mr. J.
H. Davies—Mabel, Lily, and Linda—looked deli-
cious la white dresses touched with colour and
veils which they wore when officiating re-
cently as bridesmaids. Nothing like an early
training In these important duties. A young
lady never knows what moment she may be
called to the altar. Rudolf Samuel was the
Earl of Shrewsbury in pink and blonde wig; he
was particularly early at the supper table. Gertie
Hordern was a bright Bed Riding Hood of more
than hordernarv attractions; Cissie Harris was a
tiny brunette, who came as Christmas in England,
dressed in snowflakes and tinselled ice, among
which nestled small red birds. From Woollahra
came the neatest young Sailor, all in white; and
from Petersham a Captain of the Line. Lily V alen-
tine was very pretty In white, and pink ribbons—a
valentine some young man will be awfully glad to
get some day. A conspicuous character was the
Sorceress, in black, ruby, and gold, taken by Miss
Braun; as the young iady is a jeweller’s daughter,
of course she was a gem, and a good deal watched.
Miss Lily Davies was good as Gertrude In the Loan
of a Lover”—Lily ought to have no difficulty in
negotiating a loan of that kind. Richard Zlot-
kowski wore a curious costume of red, edged with
white fur, and a hat with an eruption of red
cords from its peak, which had a peakuliar
look; he took the character of Drummer to
the Pope’s Swiss Guard; while the Captain
of the Guard was Alf, Zlotkowski—not ’alf bad,
either. Master Harris was a Spanish Nobleman in
blue and black. Miss Unwin proved a chubby
Patience, and with great discretion didn’t cover
up her arms. No less than four Miss Ryans came
from Woollahra. and all charming girls. What a
fortune for a father! Mabel in white and cardinal,
Laeta in orange pink, Blanche in blue, aud Char-
lotte in white; it almost takes one’s breath away.
Amy Brown as Nancy Lee was as cheery and naive
as a nice girl could want to be at her maiden ball.
A city surveyors young man was a Middy. Charm-
ing looked Miss Spencer in cream figured net with
little sprigs of black chenille round the shoulders,
the toilet as nice as the wearer; little sister was in
white. Three Misses Swan of Ashfleld wore white,
and two Misses Robinson of the city looked be-
witching in blue satin bodies with silver loaves,
long blue silk gloves and cream veiling skirts.
Miss Eva Thompson dances as nicely as she
plays, and it’s hard to think of anything nicer
than that ; and her sisters wore pink. Miss
Fiorrie Clarke was a Spanish dancer ; Miss
Gallagher wore a lovely pale oink silk and
net; Miss M. Bentley black, and Miss Joe white :
Miss Arline Wopd a dainty white, and Miss Sarah
Forsyth, of Manilla House, white, and crimson
ribbons. From Urquhart House were two excel-
lent fancy characters, Jessie Forsyth as Miss
Hardcastle in “ She Stoops to Conquer,” and May
Forsyth as Rod Riding Hood. Miss Grace
Buchanan appeared as a Tyrolese Peasant, and
her sister Miss Jeisls, though far too modest for
a real Pirate Lass, was nretty enough to make an
exquisite imitation. Indeed, some thought her
the prettiest character In the room. Miss Bertie
Emmett looked effective in cream with blue trim-
mings ; Miss Ltrcomhe in a somewhat similar
toilet; Miss Adelaide Gough, from Boncra, was a
gentle blonde, who cheerfully wore a garnet
satin polonaise and blue skirt ; and Miss Altona
Bohrsmann was a kind of rob you-of-your-sleep
brunette in pink satin and tarletan. made in good
style—that Is, with a due prominence given to the
proper part. Supper was a constant source of
attraction to the young folks, and during the
evening Mr. Nerds and Mrs. Baird produced a
cargo of toys, which were distributed to the juve-
niles’ great delight. About midnight ended one
of the best children’s bails yet seen at Nithsdale.
• • •
Eight enterprising young ladies gave a
party in Mrs. Martin’s academy on Thursday last,
and. despite the warmth, dancing was heartily
carried on all night. Music was provided by two
sons of sunny Italy, and a sybaritic supper was
spread by the fair ladies themselves, in really ex-
cellent style. Misses Kenyon and Bowdler did
everything to make the evening pleasant for their
guests, receiving them on entrance, and distribut-
ing programmes prepared by their own artistic
hands. Just a convenient number was present,
and the floor not crowded, a little vocalisation also
giving the dancers a chance to get their cheeks
cool. It’s hard to say whether the big girls or the
little ones have most advantage these warm
evenings. The very juvenile fairy cau always
wear her dress very short at the bottom,
whereas the big girl must have it decorously
touching her shoes, but can, on the other hand,
have it cut short on top. And the shorter it Is. of
c mrse, the better a big girl can cope with a heated
atmosphere, and convey to the male mind a cor-
rect idea of her actual value. This party gave a
treat in the way of some pretty toilets. Four
Misses Kenyon were pleasant; one in blue, all
decked with strings of snowdrops, Miss Charlotte
In lavender and fawn; and two juveniles in blue.
Four Misses Bowdler also diversified the scene
with toilets which dazzled like the stars of the
firmament and differed from one another in glory:
one was shaded blue satin, Miss Amy In cream
and ruby sash, and Misses Ada and Fiorrie in
bodices of shaded crimson satin, and white muslin
skirts with the flounces crimson-edged, and look-
ing very nice. A Darlinghurst favourite danced
well in white; two Oxford-street sisters were
named after an English king, one wearing
satin and veiling of French white, and Miss Mona
a white-flounced (linen and a belt that seemed in
the brief intervals when it w isn’t covered with a
coat sleeve to be heliotrope. A Waverley girl was
alluring all in white, and her cousin sweet and
sylph-jike in white veiling and gold ribbons.
From Watson’s Bay a young lady looked neat and
quiet in black broche garlanded with white
flowers; and from Paddington came two gentle
girls whose dainty pink veilings didn’t disguise a
charming marble whiteness kindly given by
nature. A trio of sisters appeared from Glenmore
Hoad in light attire. A saucy-looklng vision in
floating tulle, as white and light as an eddy of
snow, was daughter of a captain in Victoria-street,
with a shell necklace, and a satin-belt, and a pair
of eyes that—if anything happens to the gas-lamps
—will do to light up the whole street. The floor
was In good order, and, except that one dear little
damsel sat down with a suddenness that made her
face as pink as her dress, ail went well.

The Industrial Exhibition is most inter-
esting. A little shoppy, of course, but still there
are things there not seen in the shops every day.
Singing of an evening, too, which scarcely any-
body can hear amid the shuffling and buzz of the
crowd. Some arrasene work, which looked to our
uneducated eye like crewel work done on plush,
was pretty and useful; it serves as hangings for
shelves, or mantels, screens, music cases, toilet
bags, and it seems to afford a better opening for
young ladies than some of the things they worry
at. There are beautiful cooking-stoves, too,
which might, with advantage, be studied by some
of the fair creatures who persecute the passive
piano. Hordern sends a model of a full-dressed
lady, and some young ladies who were not models
were putting her Into shape, which was rather
interesting. In the refreshment line, the teetotal-
lers seem to have triumphed, and the masher
youth who spend their substance in riotous living,
had to remain steadfastly virtuous on raspberry
syrup and other products of the crystal fountain.
Pyrotechnics have a grand show, crowns of can-
dles, pillars of fire, national devices and mottoes,
Catherine wheels, rockets, and all kinds of explo-
sives such as Nihilists love, were all erected In one
grand paraphernalia that only wanted a match to
sot It off. We d have given anything for a match.
There are lots of photos and models, lolly stalls,
and the Inevitable man with the turning lathe and
the sinuous saw. There are splendid stuffed birds
in sublime colours, also skins of snakes which were
caught and skinned by the exhibitor. He’ll meet
one snake too many some day. The paint stall is
one of the largest and most important. We stood
looking at the piles of tins for several hours before
discovering that they were not preserved meat.
Braaawork, woodwork, glasswork, shells, needle-
work, pneumatic bells, fossils, models, inlaid work,
electroware, brushware, some charming matting,
aud a model of an invention that gently removes
suicides and other obstacles from tne tramline are
among the items. Some floral designs of dull
brown, formed entirely with skeleton loaves, are
really as pretty as anything. As we hazarded last
week, the exhibition is a pleasant lounge, with im-
proving tendencies; it Is well lighted, and easy of
access. But there is a good refreshment stall
wanted, and where, oh I where are Quong Tart and
his tea V

Melbourne Town Hall has been fashioned
into a huge snow cave, with smaller caverns bur-
rowed out of the seeming snow on each side; there
are icebergs, stalactites, crystals, apd falling waters
—In fact, Melbourne has hit upon a veal novelty.
The thing is wonderfully got up, and the young
women who dwell in the caves and prey upon the
young men who venture in, are the pick of Vic-
torian beauty. The most curious thing is that,
instead of being dressed as Esquimaux, or some-
thing in that line, which would be suitable, the
cave girls are ail attired in Shakesperlan guise.
This idea, per se, would be a pretty and effective
one; but in a polar cave, though lovely, they are
incongruous. After a procession of over 300 had
walked round, Mr. T. Lemprlere dressed as Shakes-
peare, road tne opening address, a number of
fashionables being present. Mr. T. C. Russell is
managing the snow show, which is being run in
aid of a Balaclava church.

Miss Ethel Allen’s marriage was a very
important affair, and at least 300 of the Hite of
Sydney thronged the Toxteth chapel by invitation,
to see the ceremony. The building was adorned
most apnropriately with ferns and flowers, the
latter all white, such as camellias, dahlias, car-
nations, and lilies, and the fair bride with her
sky-like eyes who entered on the arm of her
father, Sir George Wigram Allen (late Speaker of
the Assembly), looked enchanting and gentle in
her beautilul Parisian dress, which was white
satin with an immense train and trimmed with
white feathers. A brilliant-hued carpet was laid
the whole distance on the green sward from
house to church, and along it the guests marched.
Ladv Allen, the bride’s mother, wore a rich black
moire antique, with lace shoulder shawl; and Lady
Allen, senior, on Sir Alfred Stephen’s arm, wore a
black velvet robe and bonnet to correspond.
Miss Minnie Allen was attired in a handsome brown
silk and velvet dress, hat to match, and the num-
ber of stylish dresses among the spectators was
legion—some, however, being merely plain. The
company was so large that contrast was rather
an advantage. The choir sang as the bride
(who used to play the organ in the church)
entered, followed by her six bridesmaids,
all of whom were dressed in cream lace,
with Swiss belts of satin, and wore cream
lace hats decked with cream feathers and cloth of
gold roses. Two of them were sisters, Misses Ida
and Mabel Allen; and two little ones were nieces,
Misses Dodo and Caroline Alien, from the Lodge.
The Rev. Mr. Law, chaplain of the Nelson, offici-
ated, in full vestments, and among the spectators
wore a great crowd of Nelson men, in naval uni-
form, who determined not to desert the gallant
lieutenant at such a critical moment. Out of
compliment to the bridegroom’s position on H.M.S.
of war, the bridesmaids all tied their bouquets of
flowers with dark x-ibbons bearing the word
“Nelson.” Off leaving church, all were photo-
graphed, and when, shortly after, the bride and
bridegroom left for the train, they were so fiercely
bombarded with rice that it was almost like a
Chinese war, and the carriage en route drew a
good deal of notice from the fact that two small
satin slippers being prominently displayed on its
back. The bride’s travelling dress was of violet
silk, with bonnet en suite. The bridegroom is
Lieutenant Bverard B. Maxwell.

Riverriew, the residence of Mr. J. C. W.
Hinsch, at Glenfleld, was the scene of a great jolli-
fication on Wednesday last week, when Miss Emily
Hinsch was married to Mr, J. G- Hunt. The
morning train from Sydney brought the relations
and intimate friends of the happy pair, as well as
that big gun—Canon Moreton. Shortly after ar-
rival the Canon discharged his duty by transform-
ing Miss Hinsch into Mrs. Hunt. About 40 sat
down to the breakfast, which was laid out in splen-
did style in a pavilion on the banks of George’s
River, Usual toasts were drunk, and, being a hot
day, this was a pleasant and cooling proceeding
with the aid of plentiful ice. A good deal of cool-
ing is required on such occasions. Amidst a shower
of rice and old slippers, the happy twain departed
for Moss Vale by the afternoon train, and the com-
pany, which had been augmented by more arrivals
from Sydney, settled down to solid amusement.
At dark, the grounds were illuminated with
Chinese lanterns, and, later on, with a grand
pyrotechnlcal display. Dancing and singing were
varied with refreshing and sentiment, and some of
the party danced all night so as to be up early in the
morning. The bridal dress was of cream satin
broche and nun’s veiling, and was one of those
intricate compositions which a man can admire as
ineffably tasteful, but would grow grey and care-
worn if he rashly attempted to describe. The two
sisters of the bride, who acted as bridesmaids,
wore white costumes, with Burgundy silk trim-
ming and silver flowers. The mother of the bride
was attired in black grosgrain and silk broche.
Mrs. F. A. Hall, sister of the bride, was dressed In
rich black corded silk, trimmed with Spanish lace,
the jabot of lavender satin and cream lace looking
extremely tasteful; Misses Fiorrie and Lillie Hunt
were charmingly costumed in black, and the wife
of the City Surveyor was similarly attired, whilst
her two attractive daughters wore pure white. A
young lady from Balmain looked refulgent In
silver grey; and a cream and cardinal costume
was gracefully worn by a sedate young lady.
Some of the party returned by the 8 train to Syd-
ney, but the majority waited for the midday,
which brought to a close about 36 hours’ con-
tinuous festivity.

A little variety was given to the usual
breaking-up party for the Christmas holidays at
Kingsley College, Burwood, last Friday night. For
the last three months the pupils have worked like
little soldiers for the purpose of getting up a sort
of Fancy Fair in aid of Mrs. Jefferis’ “ Home for
Destitute Children; ” so dolls, handsomely dressed,
children’s frocks and plnafoi’es in endless varieties,
pin-cushions, smoking-caps, and numerous other
useful articles, ail worked by these nimble little
fingers, were arranged on several stalls in the
large school-room, and the little maidens In their
white muslin caps and aprons, found no dearth of
purchasers for their clever work. During the
evening, several of the pupils recited, and Miss
Eva Thompson contributed two or three vocal
and instrumental solos. Mr. and the Misses Ross
expect to have quite a comfortable contribution
to hand over to the “Home” on their own and
their pupil’s behalf.

Instead of the usual dinner, the Engineer-
ing Association held its celebration this year in
the form of a picnic at Correy’s, Cabarita Point.
Two or three stoamersful went down, and the
Balmain Coldstreams played for the dancing.
Oysters were the first thing, and coffee and ices
the last, and between the two was the luncheon,
whereat Mr. Henry Davies, president, took the
chair. During the speeches, Mr. Dibbs, alluding
to the presence of ladies, said that, taking an en-
gineer's view, there was not a finer piece of
mechanism in the world than a handsome and
well-proportioned woman. As Mr. Dibbs has both
a hobby for engineering and a considerable num-
ber of “pieces of mechanism,” he is qualified to
speak. A number of healths were proposed and
dances executed, and all came home at dusk. The
picnic idea was quite a success, and members
wonder they never had ladios before. The man
who imagines that ladies don’t understand en-
gineering has landed himself in the mazes of il-
limitable error.

Last Saturday afternoon, the Eastern Sub-
urbs Amateur Athletic Club picnic was held at
Tennyson. They had a splendid attendance, nearly
150 tickets being taken up, and the picnic was as
private as it was pleasant. Most of the active
young men whose names are household words in
athletic circles, were present, and so were their
sisters, and a number of other nice girls who stand
in various relations to the said young men. About
3.30 p.m., the Invincible steamer left the Quay, and
the flue music of a section of the City Band was
greatly admired as she steamed down the harbour.
On arrival, dancing at once began; but, although
the young ladies were dressed in the most summery
style, the heat was very oppressive for a while
A race, 135 yards’ handicap, was run in one interval,
the racers being nominated by ladies, and Mr. E.
Lupton won the pri ze. It was a pretty gold bracelet,
and at the tea-table It was duly presented, and
Mr. Lupton had the pleasure of affixing It with
gentle impressment on the arm of his fair nomi-
nator, Miss Hayes of Cockatoo. Later in the after-
noon the weather cooled, and dancing was really a
pleasure with such good partners and lots of room.
Strolling, football, swinging, etc., all divided atten-
tion, and the programmes were the neatest little
cards possible. Mr. H. B. Hughes was hon. sec.,
assisted by other members of the club, and the
steam home in the cool was very comfortable.
Indeed, in some cases, that short sea voyage might
be termed ecstatic.

Being a complimentary performan 3e, the
Lotus Club had a large audience of over 700 In the
New Masonic Hall on Friday. The first playthey
attacked was a comedietta called “ Uncle s Will,
Mr D. Clyne and a lady amateur being the best
characters. Then followed Byron’s comedy of
“Uncle” in three acts. Mr. J. R. Allens
make-up as Uncle was good, and his manoeu-
vres with Sarah Jane indicated much natu-
ral aptitude for such parts. Mr. L Qwist took
Paul Beaumont’s part, but heaven knows whose
voice he took. Mr. J. T. Eldridge was Peter
Fletcher, and Mr. T. Williams acted Puffin. The
characters of Mrs. Beaumont, Sarah Jane, and
Emily Montrose were done by lady amateurs. Al l
through there was plenty of applause. A per-
formance has to be fearfully bad when a compli-
mentary audience won’t applaud.
• • •
Glebe Town Hall was again gay on Friday
nljrht with a social, which was given by a number
of gentlemen to their fair friends. Evening dress
was the rule, the one exception being Miss King,
who wore a fancy toilet. But then a “ king can
dn no wrong.” Some good dancing was enjoyed
up till 4 o’clock, when all made for home
well-satisfied and rather fatigued. Miss M Na-
ni ara looked admirably well in cream veiling
and lace, and Miss Morgan’s darkness was suited
with black broche and cream lace. Miss Orchard
was a fair girl in black velvet, Miss Cripps wore
black with a plaid sash, and Miss Crawshaw a
pretty pink llama. Miss Jackson was a slim and
sentimental maiden in black, trimmed with forget-
me-nots. Two Miss Patons in cream muslin, with
blue and cardinal respectively, were attractive.
The polonaise schottische was a pleasing innova-
tion on the usual list.

Dearest IBeele,— It invariably occurs to me
whenever I come across one of those splendid
American magazines for children, St. Nicholas,
that the little folks of to-day are having better
times than fell to our lot. How we should have
gloated over the charming pictures and natural
stories 1 For, in our times, the heroes and heroines
were dlshearteningly good, whilst the bad boys and
girls wore fearfully wicked. Ordinary children
like ourselves, who were neither supremely good
nor, I hope, down right wicked, had no place in
these books; in fact, we were entirely ignored.
But we recognise ourselves in the St. Nicholas
stories, and read that it is possible for children
to quarrel and light, and make it up again, with-
out being considered past redemption. We could
have loved these St. Nicholas children, for the
simple reason that they were as one of us, and we
could have sympathised with them in all their
*orapcs, and rejoiced over their good times ; but
those unnatural little prigs in our story books,
whose perfect conduct we were urged to imitate,
were dreadful bugbears to us, weren’t they ? And
I see thatat home Lady Egerton has been superin-
tending a doll show. Fancy ! a doll show 1 Why,
we had to be content with either those perfectly
hideous painted wood affairs, or perishable wax
ones with impossible flaxen ringlets ; whilst now
the variety is so great that a doll show is justifi-
able, and never in my life did I so much long for
children’s days to come over again as when I read
about this show. Oh 1 yes, they certainly have
better times than we had ; but the worst of it is
they don’t know it, and take everything as a matter
of course.
oh, dearl this heat I I am sure it must be about
150’ in the shade. Fain would I lay aside my pen
and endeavour to be deaf to the voice which is
for ever calling out, “What news? what news?’
But, no; I will try and forget that, in a cool, shady
nook at the bottom of the garden there is a tiny
fountain playing and a “ triumph ” chair spread
out invitingly, on which are lying all the latest
periodicals ; besides, I fancy I hear from a distant
part of the house the swish, swish, of the ice-
cream machine, and I am almost sure they are
making some delicious fruit ices for a surprise for
me. Although they won’t be a surprise, they will
be very acceptable, and I will do my very best to
feign astonishment when they bring some in to
me. With these good things in view, then, I will
brace myself up to tell you all the news I can.
1 think everybody was out of sorts on the Sydney
Liedertafel night, for we found fault with the
music, heat, and even the dresses. It may be we
are becoming hypercritical concerning these con-
certs. I don’t know, but certainly, I, for my part,
could not work up any enthusiasm about any-
thing. I think I may except Chopin s funeral
march, which was arranged for voices and instru-
ments by Herr Vogrich-yes, I certainly do ex-
cept that, for it was truly beautiful, Madame
Vogrich singing the solo part charmingly. The
ertand. sad music drew from us a series of Byromo
sighs, which relieved our feelings a good
deal and made us feel ever so much better.
I had been feeling very bad during the per-
formance of Hummel’s Septuor, for the flute
was so distressingly sharp that it spoilt the rest.
The player tried to remedy it before commencing
the second part, but wasn’t quite successful. It
was a pity to spoil the whole thing just through
careless tuning. The piano part of thjs selection
was very brilliant. The ‘ William Tell overture,
which made such a good impression at a former
concert, was. to my astonishment, very coolly re-
ceived. It is true, the clarionet was substituted
for the oboe, but then the flute in this case was
very good indeed, though still just a trifle sharp.
The violins, too, were capital, yet it did not seem
to satisfy so fully as the lormer rendition. But I
am not going to say another word about the
music, excepting to remark that the cuoruses
were fairly sung, and the conductor looked dread-
fully tired when it was all over—he seems to me to
exert himself too much. 1 have heard people say
it is a good fault, though it makes me feel awfully
fatigued to watch him -conduct; but then, not
everybody’s nature is as sympathetic as mine.
And now you will want to know what fault I
had to find with the dresses. Well, it seemed to
me as if some had dressed so hurriedly that they
had not given themselves time to see whether
their [colours harmonised. For instance, I saw a
crimson satin bodice over a lace skirt, below the
hem of which a deep pink satin frill asserted itself.
Now, without the frill it was right enough, but
why, oh I why was that frill there ? And, again, a
pink jacket over a deep heliotrope skirt
was not at all nice. Quite a relief to t*e eye,
however, was a lovely pink silk, cut very
low, showing pretty shoulders and nice arms,
but I felt sorry for the train, for I knew it would
not escape damage. Madame Vogrich wore white,
with long Spanish lace jabot and natural flowers.
The soft whites and creams looked best, but a
flowered French muslin was sweetly pretty also.
And I liked a cream cashmere with faint dashes of
pale lavender satin ribbon here and there. But
where is the use of singling out any when, per-
haps, the very best weie lost upon us in the crowd ?
I dislike mittens very much, but if the weather
continues to be as hot as this, I shall be glad
enough to wear them in lieu of gloves. I noticed
many wore them upon this occasion, and in doing
so they showed more sense than the rest of us,
who preferred torture with elegance to comfort
without it.
I promised myself the pleasure of going to the
Amateur Athletic Club’s picnic on Saturday, but,
somehow, we found ourselves on board the Fair-
light bound for the Garden Party at Fairllght,
Manly. I don’t know when I spent a more unin-
teresting afternoon, for, besides the weather being
most oppressive, the Garden Party was such a
dismal failure, that it was most depressing. It was
very kind of Mr. Fitz-Stubbs to lend his grounds
for the occasion, and I cannot imagine why the
affair was so unsuccessful. We looked in vain for
the sports — tennis tournament, lady’s cricket
match, and so forth; but, certainly, there was an
Aunt Sally. I suppose there were about a hundred
people there in all, who did little else but stand in
groups and deplore the failure of their scheme to
add to the church fund. I was glad to see Mrs.
Fitz-Stubbs sufficiently recovered from her recent
dangerous Illness to bo able to saunter about
the grounds; and her fair daughters, both mar-
ried and single, beautifully dressed, did their
very best to make things a little lively. But
it was a sorry task, and no one seemed to meet
them half-way. we were not quite broken-
hearted when it was time to skip over the ditches
and bend our steps homewards, and I must say I
was never at a funnier Garden Party in my life. I
have come to this conclusion, viz., that there is no
money to bo made, either for church funds or for
broken-down musical societies by either Garden
Parties or matinees. I would suggest either a
baby show or an amateur circus.
There was more enthusiasm shown at the seventh
Vogrich Soiree than at the previous one, and 1
think the audience was a trifle larger. But it can-
not be denied that these concerts are inclined to
be monotonous—the same players, the same singer,
and the same style of music. No doubt it hurts a
man’s pride to play down to the public taste, but
he must do it sometimes or the public won’t be
played to at all. It will rebel, and give music up
as a bad job. I think If Herr Vogrich were to
coax his audiences by giving them a little trash
occasionally, it would be well: and he could do it
without losing any of his dignity, for we should
know his object was to please others at consider-
able self-sacrifice. But, no doubt, he knows his
own business best. Madame Vogrich was in her
very best voice, and received several bouquets. 1
suppose when these Soirees are over we shall have
a musical famine, for I have heard of nothing to
take their place as yet.
I was so glad to hear Verdi isn’t dead, weren’t
you ? For although I never admired his singing
very much, as he always adopted that objec-
tionable vibration which, I am sorry to hear, is
quite common now amongst singers at home, still
he looked so nice that wo forgave him the tremolo,
and tried to make ourselves believe that he couldn’t
sing out of tune if he tried ever so; and I always
forget to tell you how very popular that tiniest of
prima donnas. Miss Grade Plaisted, is becoming.
Her acting is very piquant and graceful, and she
and Mr. Harding have a good deal to answer for in
the success of “ Bobadil,” which is still running,
and is likely to do so for some time.
And now I think I have fairly earned my ices,
don’t you ?
Ever your loving
MAB.
P.S.—To err is human. I am human, and I have
erred in thinking-1 heard the icecream-machine at
work. It was the new washing-machine they
were trying in the laundry but it sounded from
the distance exactly like the ice-cream machine—
or, at all events, I imagined it did. When I dis-
covered my mistake, my heart was too full for
words, so, with a suppressed sigh, I turned away
and went to my book. But, lol another disap-
pointment. There I Und lazy Ned fast asleep in
my chair, and I knew quite well if 1 wakened him
he would have been as cross as a bear and very
likely have refused to take me to ‘’Carmen,”
which would just have been the climax of my
woes to-day. Bo I left him alone in his glory, and
soothed my troubled breast by trying on for about
the twentieth time two lovely new hats my god-
mother sent me last week, And it was to tell you
about them that I added this P.S. One is of pure
white lace, “ La Coquille ” shape, which has a
sharp upward peak in front and fits close over the
ears. One beautiful bunch of red currants orna-
ments the side. The other is the *‘ Mother Hub-
bard” shape, with a very, very high peaked
crown, lined with black velvet, and the sole trim-
ming a beautifully coloured silk kerchief. I like
these kerchief trimmings; they are so simple and
yet so graceful when properly arranged. Now, if
I don’t nurry and send this off to the post it will be
too late, and you will never, never know all I have
suffered this afternoon for your dear sake.

The Supreme Court decision in Mr. Tay-
lor’s case has given great satisfaction—to his con-
stituents. It was felt to be a curtailment of the
liberty of the subject, that a man who could damn

not '* damn the chair.”
The New Zealand Hansard is now issued
to subscribers in any part of the country, post
free at 3d. a number. As a result its circulation
has risen from 100 to 1100. Whether this is a cause
for joy or grief is a question. There are as yet no
records of fatal results having attended Its
perusal.
That was a curious “special telegram”
published in the Echo, but suppressed in the

published.
The Rum reporters should not be entrusted

They are telling a story about Harry
Levien, M.P., which was once told about the Duo
de Morny. Lately, the member for Tamworth has
been thinking that his style of dress, especially his
hat. was of too giddy a kind for a member of Par-
liament, So he consulted his hatter, “ Make your
mind easy, Mr. Levien,” said the hatter. “ We can
make you one of a serious shape, but with a little
gaiety in the brim.”
A Queensland M P., Mr. Midgley, would
have no higher salary paid by the State to anyone,
not even to the Govern >r, than £300 a year. This
is cutting it a little too flue. There are certainly
Governors (in Barataria, let us say) who are dear
at £50 a year, and Dr. Roes in office would be dear
at £200. But, then, look at Burdett Smith. Why,
£15 ooo a year would be cheap to get him for. His
hair alone would be worth the money.
A proposal has been made to the New

session only last four months' it is anticipated that
careful collections in the smoking and refreshment
rooms would produce over £2000. Sir John Robert'
son is to be asked to take the Chalrmanshln of
Directors, and will be counted as a wholesale cus-
tomer. In many other cases considerable discounts
will be allowed.
Conservatism has most discreetly given
way in Tasmania, and the representative system
of Government there is no longer an Australian
anomaly. The suffrage is now practically a man-
hood one, and the Legislative Council themselves
reduced the qualification for their electors from
£100 proposed by the Assembly to £30. Next’year
the number of members of both Houses will bo
increased, and the principle of triennial Parlia-
ments established.
The Victorian Secretary for Agriculture
has received four notices of competition for the
best reaping and harvesting machine—prize of
£350. One of these is from South Australia, two
are Victorian, and one is from London. New
South Wales is out of it, of course. And yet look
how Sir John Robertson’s Act has developed the
farming Industry, i f it was the best machine for
dummying that was wanted, now, New South
Wales would be in it up to her neck.
The Victorian Government purpose con-
centrating their efforts next session on a new
Rabbit Act (amongst other things). A very short
Rabbit Extirpation Bill is being rushed through
tnls session. This is a mere stop-gap until bunny
is fairly tackled. It is no wonder, these things
being so, that an answer to one of the questions at
the recent junior examination of the Sydney Uni-
versity should have rather astonished the exa-
miner. He wrote: “ What is the principal political
question throughout all Australia and New Zea-
land to-dav.” As an answer he expected “ Fede-
ration.” He got “Rabbits.”
The state of affairs in Belgium has lately
been attracting a great deal of attention in Europe.
“ It is not unlikely that Belgium will be annexed
to France before long,” says a gentleman who is
in a position to form a good idea of tne situation.
“ The Republicans are getting very strong in
Belgium, and a change might take place any
moment.” In our opinion, however, Bismarck
and Germany would offer effective opposition to
any project for the annexation of Belgium to
France at the present moment, no matter how
great the ascendancy of the Republican party in
Belgium may be. or how strong may be their
desire to unite with the French Republic.
Another Maori embassy to England is in
contemplation. This time Katane wants to see
Bffrl Derby on behalf of the Ngapuhi tribe, Bay of
Islands. The Ngapuhis want local self-govern-
ment; that is, they object to the Pakeha’a rates
and taxes. By the way, the Maoris have a very
terse way of putting official requests. Nearly
twenty years ago, some of them wrote to a New
Zealand Governor“ O, Governor, greetings.
You have sent unto us a surveyor, one H . He
has brought with him two intruments, his theodo-
lite and a rum bottle. Of the former he makes no
use, of the latter too much. Pray remove. That
is all.” (And hereifollowed the signatures.)
“Mr. Parnell is moving heaven and earth
against nationalisation of the land, and is at dag-
ger’s drawn with Mr. Michael Davltt.” says a cor-
respondent in London who is behind the scenes.
“ It is expected by the Parnellltes that owing to
the influence Mr. Davltt has acquired, the
labourers’ vote in the next election will be against
them. Parnell is the farmer’s champion and does
not care for the labourers. Mr. Arch, too, does
not much like nationalisation. Both prefer
peasant proprietorship ; and it is really a fact
that a majority of the country people themselves
still prefer peasant proprietorship; also, they don’t
understand the “ nationalisation,” and rather
seem to dislike it, thinking it suggestive of the
tax-gatherer, and that under it they might feel
themselves to be even less masters of their own
houses than they now are.”
Here is a terrible revelation. Says Car-
coar Mary, with reference to an episode of the
Baker election:—‘‘The proceedings, as described
to us by an eye-witness, were of a most disgrace-
ful nature. Gin and whisky are said to have been
provided, and freely used within the polling-booth.
Wo purpose getting at the truth of the matter, if
possible.” A very patriotic resolution! It is just
as wed to get at the truth when it is too late to get
at the gin and whisky. But what a shocking thing
it is, after all, to think that the free and en-
lightened electors of sunny New South Wales
(how we love these withered oiu phrases!) can be
corrupted by gin and whisky I Now, if it had been
champagne, or even three-star, we could nave
looked with more leniency on the affair. But gin
and whisky, and probably bad gin and whisky at
thatl Pah I it is too degrading to dwell upon. We
are not so surprised that these degrading stimu-
lants were “ provided,” but to think that they
were ‘‘freely used” prostrates us completely.
The state of morals in Oarooar must be desperate.
indeed. Anyhow, Mr. Baker, in addition to his
other complimentary titles, will in future be
known as the member for Gin and Whisky.
The Executive have had under careful
consideration Mr. Russell’s report on the recent
hot wind and dust storm. It will be remembered
that the Observatory recorded 943 miles of wind
as having passed within 24 hours, and that 50
miles an hour were noticed during some hours.
The dust carried was tremendous. Now what
the Executive think is this. That if during next
session of Parliament Mr. Russell could take
measures for accurately recording the wind
wasted by hon. members, and the comparative
quantity of dust raised by each of them, some
scientific data of the utmost importance from a
political point of view might be formulated.
Thus it was a disputed point during the late long
session whether Dan O'Connor or A. G. Taylor
expended most wind. To be sure the West Syd-
ney man was at first thought to have had the pull
of the Mudgee favourite because of his selection
of fine long words that, as an admirer said, “ tuk
the breath out av wan.” Indeed, when Dan called
a snail a'gusterspadous mollusc, he was considered
well in it. But Taylor’s address to the Judges
brought him even. However, Mr. Russell is not
to observe simoly for the benefit of the leading
wind-raisers. Melville and Abigail, and Garrard,
and our only other Buchanan (one of 'era's on the
bench), and Poole and Oliffe, and, oh, a lot of them
that expend wind and raise dust, will bo looked
after.
Young de Montmorency was showing his
English cousin round Sydney on Saturday last, and
It so happened that they were near the statue of
the late T. 8, Mort at a quarter to one, the hour
when Government clerks swarm out of their re-
spective departments. The visitor put up his eye-
glass, and, looking critically across Bridge-street,
said, “ 1 see the-aw—people are vewwy—aw—
fenerous heah; the most handsome Soup-kitchen
evah saw.” “ Soup-kitchen I ” said Y. de M.,
horrified; “why, that’s the Lands Office.” The
visitor apologised. “ Oh, I wegwet the ewwor, but
really I thought it was a Chawlty, from the style of
the—aw—fellors ooimng out." He wasn’t far wrong,
either ; viewed as a public charity, the Lands
Office can knock spots off anything this side of the
equator,
“ ’Tis the will to God to be pretty, so long
as you’re not lop-eared,” used to be the trite ex-
pression of a Tirana philosopher of the bush type,
when complimented on his beauty by the local
rustics. And we might Just here remark that the
Tirana philosopher was not in the least lovely.
Still, it would appear that professional beauty has
its inconveniences. For instance, the editor of
the Yarrawonqa Chronicle (Vic.)—who, to
judge by his paper, may be a wombat—finds it
necessary, owing to his personal attractions,
doubtless, to instruct one of his contributors, a
local fencing master (chock and log), to In-
sert the following notice:— **The editor of the
Chronicle desires me to state that if those young
ladies who visit the window of his oflice at night
time, when he is writing at his editorial slab, really
desire to amuse him by tapping at the window,
then laughing and running away, and returning
and repeating the performance, he is very grate-
ful to them and publicly thanks them lor the
same. But he wishes further, to state that their
conduct is more distracting than amusing.” What
giddy dogs these country editors are, to he sure I
It is not such a bad thing after all to be
well-connected, True, to bo well-connected seems
in a great many Instances to be a good passport
into gaol, but then you see, on the other hand, it is
a mighty convenient lever with which to open the
doors of the prison again. These solemn reflec-
tions have been induced by the case of that sportive
lawyer in Adelaide, Mr. 8. G. Kingston. This lively
law expounder was having a good time recently
driving round the city in a cab, but after a while
that amusement kind of palled on him, so he made
a target of the cabman, and playfully inserted a
bullet in Jehu’s cobra. For this little escapade he
was sent up for six months,and the cabman took a
front seat in the hospital. Had Kingston not been
well connected, he would still have been languish-
ing in a dungeon cell, but after “ doing ” a few
months, the Government have been graciously
pleased to order his release from prison. Oh, and
now that we come to think of it, there is a gentle-
man named Chas. C. Kingston in the South Austra-
lian Government, and by a strange coincidence he is
just at present filling the office of Attorney-
General. But then it is only a coincidence.
Lord Wolseley’s present command is the
fourth he has held since the Bed River expedition
of 1870. In 1873-4 he commanded in Ashantee ; in
1879. in the closing operations in Zululand ; In 1883,
in Egypt. He entered the army r.s ensign in the
12th Foot in 1853, and served in the Burmese war of
’52-53; took part in Sir John Chope’s expedition
against the robber chief Myattoon, In leading a
storming party against whose stronghold he was
severely wounded ; distinguished himself In the
Crimea, where he got his captaincy, and was badly
wounded in a sortie ; was present in the Indian
campaign of 1857-59 at the relief of Lucknew, the
defence of the Alumbagh by Outram, with the
various engagements connected with it; the siege
and capture of Lucknow ; and with the Oude field
force in the actions at Baree, Nawabgunge, Simree,
Fyzabad, Sultanpore, at the passage of theGoom-
tee, and in the Byswarra, Trans-Gogra, and Trans-
Baptee campaigns. In 1860-1, in the China war, he
was present at the landing at Pelltang, at the
assault and capture of Tangku, at the battle of
Slnho, at the assault and capture of the Pelho forts,
at the battle of Palichan, and in the advance on
Pekin. He wears eight medals for active service.
“ Why does a man marry a woman, and
cling to her through life ?” was the rather start-
ling prize conundrum which a Northern gospel-
sharp of a philosophical turn of mind recently
fired off at the heads of his puzzled congregation.
And as none of the faithful seemed to know, we
have gone into the trouble with a vim, and are
in a position to give the faithful some information
on the subject that will positively make their
heads ache. Imprimis, a man marries a woman
because she belongs to a sex which is peculiarly
adapted for marriage purpose; and he only mar-
ries one at a time because sufficient for the day is
the evil thereof, and if he doesn’t happen to be
aware of that fact when he opens up on the marry-
ing biz , he’ll speedily grow into a full appreciation
of it. Some marry for love, which is good; some
marry for cash, which is a far better thing to live
on; and some marry because they are a restless
lot, and detest a life of monotony. Touching the
hinder part of the pastor’s query, “ Why does a
man cling to his wife through life ?” we can only
say that one very good reason is because the hellish
tyranny of the British law compels him to do so,
as long as the Missus acts square, and doesn’t cut
up rough after the style of giddy old Mother
Potlphar. Alfred Bougeart, who lives in Rue de
Something, Paris, has successfully wrestled with
this trouble, however, and in his “ Tine Physiologic
du Marlage,” Parisian Alfred says: "One holds to
his wife through love of the comfortable home,
just as he would to any serviceable kitchen
utensil, or to a cozy old arm-chair which
is always ready for him when he returns
home." This is neat, for a native of the most
gallant nation in the world, but Alf. forgets to say
which pud of the arm-chair— the leg, the arm, or
the back—is always ready for him when ho returns
home, and this at times makes quite a considerable
amount of difference. We like Alfred better when
he gets more into the sap of his subject, as it were,
and tells us that a man sticks on to his better three-
quarters “ for economy, as a servant-girl costs him
twice as much, and does not do him half the service,
or he sticks through self-respect as to a bad bargain
which he would not give it to say he had the folly
to make, or through human respect—what would
the neighbours say ? or through imitation—every
other man has his wife and keeps her; or because
to be married fixes a man and gives him pose ; or
because he is vain of his strength of character, and
agreatsoul should know howto support a distress-
ful condition without complaint; or from manly
dignity he must respect his name; or because of
the scandal, the law, or religion; or from philo-
sophy-all women are alike; or as a penitential exer-
cise-through my fault, through my fault, through
my most grievous great fault; or through vain-
glory—* what a handsome woman 1’ they say of his
wife; or from conscience—* poor woman, after all
it is not her fault If I have grown tired of her;* or
through malice— * well, here I am in the trap,
l»t me not prevent others getting trapped as well.”
There are a few other reasons given which we
will hold over until the present sultry weather
cools a trifle, contenting ourselves with Monsieur
Bougeart’s wind-up, which says "Apostles of the
religion of the family, find me menage. I have
searched in vain these twenty years, so that I may
hasten to add that, after a few months of married
life, a man seldom holds to his wife because he
loves her.” That’s all, dear girls; and now the
sentence of the Court is that Alfred Bougeart |be
strapped up to a dressmaker’s dummy wltn corset-
strings, and flogged to death with pink garters.

HUMILIATING BLOTCHES
ILL MCDONALD, £543 Dearborn-street, Chi’
cago, gratefully acknowledges a cure of
Salt Rheum on Head, Neck, Face, Arms, and Legs,
for seventeen years ; not able to walk except on
hands and knees for one year ; not able to help
himself for eight years ; tried hundreds of reme-
dies ; doctors pronounced his case hopeless ; per-
manently cured by Cuticura Resolvent inter-
nally and Cuticura Soap externally.
CUTICURA REMEDIES are the greatest medi
cines on earth. Had the worst case Salt Rheum
in this country. My mother had it twenty years,
and in fact died from it. I believe Cuticura would
have saved her life. My arms, breast, and head
were covered for three years, which nothing re-
lieved or cured until 3 used the Cuticura Resol-
vent internally, and Cuticura and Cuticura
Soap externally. J. W. Adams, Newark. 0.

Heights, N.J., writes: “My son, a lad of
twelve years, was completely cured of a terrible
ase of Eczema by the Cuticura Remedies. From
the top of his head to the soles of tus feet was one
mass of scabs.” Every other remedy and physi-
cians had been tried in vain.
MR. and MRS, EVERETT STEBBINS, Belcher,
town, Mass., write: “Our little boy was
terribly afflicted with Scrofula, Salt Rheum and
Erysipelas ever since he was born, and nothing we
could give him helped him until we tried Cuticura
Remedies, which gradually cured him, until he is
now as fair as any child.”

Crewkeme, Nov. 12, 1880.
Sir, —My patients have given
me a very satisfactory account
of Dr. Scott’s Electric Hair Brush.
One lady assures me that she gets no
neuralgia in her face if she uses it, and
others state that by a few minutes’ brush-
ing with the Electric Brush, a nervous headache,
or one arising from overwork or debility, is quickly
removed. The invention is, I think, very valuable.
I ud, your obwlient servant, G. F. Wills, M.D., M.R. C.S.B. Elegantly Carved t Mounted

th °e re f, t advantages of your Electric Hair Brush for some time, and, as I find the benefits increasing,
I feel it my duty, as well as my pleasure, to earnestly recommend it. No oae who has not tried it can possibly imagine how material its comfort is ’

We read that “ the crematory planned for
Chicago la to cost about $25,000, and is to have
three retorts, one for men, one for women, a»d
one for children. The projectors say they will
allow the remains of no malefactor or pauper or
disreputable person to be incinerated in them.”
No pauper, indeed! If the American paupers are
at all like the English paupers, they’re not fat
enough to burn. The Porkopolites evidently think
to burn Dives in this world, so that poor Lazarus
won’t have the laugh at him in the next.
“Satan and the Sword” is the title of a
little pamphlet written by S. Donaldson, of Myall
Park, Liverpool Plains. It bears throughout evi-
dence of being the work of a man who has not
enjoyed the advantage of a liberal education, and
who has not learned to arrange his thoughts ;n
coherent form. But it equally indicates that the
writer has thoughts. His text Is that “ unjust
land laws are the foundation of Satan’s kingdom ”
and “ the 8 word the administrator of Satan’s laws.”
The argument is not methodical by any means;
but its drift is plain enough, and affords evidence
that among uninstructed men of natural abilities,
even in Australia, where the evils of land monopoly
are less telt than in almost any country peopled by
Europeans, the principles of social reform are en-
gaging attention. Mr. Donaldson has looked out
several significant texts, which he commends to the
attention of clergymen and statesmen. Here is
one:—“ * Woe unto them that join house to house,
that lay field to field till there be no place-that
they may be placed alone in the earth.’—Isaiah
c. 5, v. 8.” And here’s an application of it which
strikes Mr. Donaldson (and ourselves) as apt:—
“‘Who owns Great Britain?’ Five men own
one-fourth of Scotland ; one duke owns 98,000
acres in Derbyshire, besides vast estates in other
parts of England and Ireland. Another with es-
tates all over the United Kingdom, has 40,000 acres
in Sussex, and 300,000 acres in Scotland. (This
noble park is 15 miles in circumference.) Another
duke has estates which the high road divides for
33 miles: a marquis who can ride 100 miles upon
his own land; a duko who owns almost an entire
county, stretching from sea to sea; an earl who
draws £200,000 yearly from estates in Lancashire;
a duke who regularly invests £80,000 a year.in buy-
ing up lands] adjoining his already enormous es-
tates; a marquis enjoying £1,000.000 sterling and
£160,000 a year from land. The income derived
from land by one ducal family is £1,600,0001 which
is increasing every year by the falling in of leases.
One hundred and fifty persons own one-half of
England ; seventy-five persons own one-half of
Scotland; thirty-five persons own one-half of Ire-
land; and all the lands of England, Scotland and
Wales are owned by less than 60,000 persons.”
Mr. Donaldson is of opinion, as we are, that the
clergy lose their hold upon the masses because
they (the former) have lost their grip of the true
spirit—the democratic and communistic spirit—of
Christ’s teachings. “See whom the Prophets im-
peach. They impeach the rulers, and produce
facts to justify their impeachment. Missionaries,
reformers, and evangelists impeach the sufferers,
but produce false assertions, which I will en-
deavour to prove from facts—facts are indisput-
able evidence. 1 have read the outset of a great
many reformers and evangelists, and their boast
was, as a rule, that they plunged into the dens of
infamy and crime to reform or Christianise, and
bring the people into a state of repentance; but
those evangelists never asked themselves what
caused those dens of Infamy and crime: first seek
the cause, and then apply the remedy. I have
watched the progress and success of those re-
formers; many terrible things which they have
reported I have found on inquiry to be true—of
suffering and misery—of starvation and death;
but they laid all these troubles at their (the people’s)
own doors, impeaching them with drunkenness
and impenitence—and that God sent those visita-
tions on them for their wickedness. . . Crime is
fruit—by tracing the fruit to the branch, from the
branch to the trunk, and from the trunk to the root.
. . The land laws ere the foundation of injustice,
and this causes the whole structure to be unsound.”
In this connection the pamphleteer adduces the
following texts:—“The priests said not,where is
the Lord ? and they that handle the law knew me
not of it; the pastors, also, transgressed against
me: and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and
walk after things that do not profit.’—Jeremiah,
c. 2, v. 8. “ All ye beasts of the field come to
devour; yea, all ye beasts ir the forest. His
watohmen are blind, tin. y are all ignorant, they are
all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying
down, loving to slumber; yea, they are greedy
dogs which can never have enough, and they are
shepherds that cannot understand: they all look
to their own way—everyone for his gain from his
quarter.”—Isaiah, o. 56, v. 9, 10, 11. “ Behold, the
day will come, saith the Lord, that I send a famine
in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for
water, but of a hearing of the words of the Lord;
and they shall wander from sea to sea, and from
the north even to the east; they shall run to and
fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find
it.”—Amos, c, 8, v. 11 and 12.

lyr EVER previously did any piano win such a hold
rj-i °n the public as the Mignon has done since
its introduction. Our competitors have no doubt
x . ev .ol b«st to rival us-blazoning forth
their bald imitations with a tremendous flourish
of trumpets. What result have they to show,
excepting to point to the gradual death of all their
offspring? The reason is soon found. Inferior
instruments, with showy exteriors, have been
brought forth and attempted to be foisted on the
public. But the right-thinking public will have
none of them. The consequence is that the
Sales off the Mignon Piano
have Trebled.
THE MIGNON PIANO
has found its way into every town almost of all
the colonies—in Victoria and New South Wales,

kpd; In New Zealand, from one end to the other
of the islands. In South Australia and Tasmania

An old couple living near the Black Forest,
childless and alone-tbelr chlldr n having preceded
them to the grave—recently celebrated their dia-
mond wedding. It was really a touching sight to
see tnem sitting together at their cottage door on
tho. occurrence of their seventieth wedding-day.
They were both comparatively well, and quite
enjoyed the Influx of visitors attracted thither by
curb sity.
A publican, who has already buried two
wives, and Is in his eighty-flist year, presented
himself at a Nottingham church with his intended
bride, aged forty, who has recently been his
housekeeper. An interested party, coming to
Nottingham by the same train, discoveied that the
wedding was about to take place, and arrived at
the church just In time to stop the ceremony on
the ground of Informal publication of the banns.
A funny thing happened to an American
belle at Long Branch. On her first show, she wore a
beautiful bathing suit of white flannel, with red
silk sash and dainty cap. Everyone looked at the
charming little picture, and thought how pretty
she was. But she made the sad mistake of going
into the water, and when she came out, blushing
vividly as she saw how scores of eyes gazed on the
spoiled drees, which now clung to her outline like
wet tissue paper, she sobbed out to a friend: ‘ Oh,
1 didn’t know—I live in 8t. Louis, and I never
bathed before except in a tub!” Sweet sim-
plicity I
Tbeieason Englishwomen join.the Mormons
Is that they can’t get husbands in England, One
woman recently said that out of 100 women folks
between the ages of 20 and 35 In her native village
there were husbands for only 56 of ’em. Fourteen
of the other 44 had owned husbands once, but they
had died. The remaining 30 never had any, and
had no hopes of getting any. She seemed to have
made a study of the question, for she said that
there were less than 4,000,000 women between 20
and 40 yonrs in all England and Wales, and of them
nearly 2,000,000 were unmarried. In short, lovely
woman takes a share in a Mormon husband on the
half-loaf-better-than-no-bread principle.
Jersey is a veritable home of pretty women.
The island, wrapped In soft white mist every night,
has a magnificent climate; but wages ar« so low
that men leave It In shoals, fe w but the very young
and very old remaining to work. It Is the women
who work, and their active life gives them grace-
ful. sinewy strength, rare complexions, and match-
less health. Small women are the exception; most
grow to ripe, full figures, having dark hair and
eyes, and never know what It is to feel tiiod or 111.
The glory of Jersey Is i(s beautiful women. And
the crowning glory of a Jersey woman is that, If
she gained ten shillings all in one vast sum, it
would make her happy for six months afterwards.
When God makes women like he does in Jersey,
they don’t want grand toilettes.
“ Zamiel ” tells this significant little story:
—“ Marv was well educated, and, as she stood in
the prisoner's box and the Magistrate asked,
• Were you drunk ?’ she said, ‘Certainly I «os, sir.
Mary was tall, well developed, with a face that was
dreamily pretty. The fine was pronounced.
• Where’s mama ?' muttered the young girl, look-
ing round from the box, in her blue dress, and a
Lady Hamilton straw hat, wreathed with corn-
tiowere. iover a face and bead that might have
done for Psyche. She had been to a dance, taken
brandy and lemonade until she fell, and the con-
stable picked her up and pillowed her aching, be-
wildered, handsome head on the stones of the cell.
A few months ago, Mary was a Sunday school
teacher-now she Is dancing mad, like some other-
young Auckland gins. Drunk I So fair, and not

All girls look best in white, and this season
white Is “ In.” If any girl has captured a parcel of
that scarce commodity, the eligible man—it was
her white dress did it. Even elderly ladles look so
fresh and cheery In their blanched raiment that a
man might be pardoned for the temporary error
of supposing a few of them may make tolerable
mothers-in-law. And scrawny scraps of antiquity,
long hopelessly on the shelf before this white mania
came with its blessed ray of hope, look actually
nice as they lloat round In soft white flannel, or in
bishops lawn with three flounces and a flower at
the throat. It lends an merest to her etiolated
face, and almost rounds off the selvage of her
sharp shoulder blades. In white, a pretty woman
can kick this helpless globe as she likes, anditgoes
before her passively. The material doesn t matter
much—cambric, cashmere, or the voile of the pious
nun—white brings out all the charms and contour
she has. and It softens the minute defects which,
ay-bo 1 even the loveliest women are sometimes
heirs to.

papas must, Indeed, be in evil case; but perhaps it
may be their mammas who look after their ward-
robes for them. M. O’Kell lurther remarks that
nether garments, which in french are colloquially
termed “ indispensables,” arc in England spoken
of as “unmentionables;” and that if, in an assem-
bly of English ladies, an allusion were made to Mr.
So-and-So’s “ Irreproachable trousers, all faces
would be veiled, and Insistence on the topic would
cause a veritable panic in the room. Max is
deeply shocked and scandalised by what he con-
siders to ho the indelicacy of the homily addressed
by the officiating clergyman to a young couple
when they come to the altar to be joined together
In holy matrimony. Some English readers may
be able to appreciate the keen wit and ph losophfc
insight of Count Xavier de Malstre’s “ Voyage
autour de ma Chambre ;” but they fall to see the
humour of M. O’KeU’s excursus on the furniture
and fittings of an English lady’s bedchamber—if,
indeed, the apartment can be called a lady’s when
the chronicler tells us that It closely resembles the
sleeping-room of a female domestic servant In
France. Monsieur O’Kell admits that English girls
are often very pretty, although he finds his highest
standard of female beauty among the barmaids at
the London refreshment buffets. Those damsels
are, in the opinion of M. Max O’Rell, “superbly
lovely.” Judging from the muster of Australians
at Spiers and Pond’s bars, most of the colonists
who go to London are of M. O’Kell’s opinion.
A bull-fight of a novel kind took place at
Tarragona recently, the performers being women
clothed in the male torera suit. The bulls were all
young and full of fire. The first one let into the
arena made straight for one of tbe toreras, and
sent her spinning in the sand several yards off. A
second torera rushed to the rescue with her capa,
which she waved before the bull to draw off his
attention from her discomfited colleague. The
bull accepted the challenge at once, and with a
rapid twist of the neck caught the banderilla and
sent her flying. She fell on her face, and followed
the previous torera in her retirement, bleeding
from several scratches. The third torera then ad-
vanced ; but no sooner had the bull caught sight
of her than .he bounded towards her and tossed
her. After this the bull took a quiet walk around
the arena, waiting for fresh sport. No further
competitor appeared; the crowd clamoured for
their money back, the cashier bolted with the
takings, and it required three companies of in-
fantry to quell the resultant riot. The most extra-
ordinary part of the affair is that, undeterred by
the fate of the first company of toreras and their
managers, who were marched off to prison besides,
the workwomen of the tobacco factories of Madrid
are preparing to give an exhibition of their
prowess, and a troupe is organising to do the
round of the arenas in all tbe principal towns of
Spain.
Girls as ushers have just been intro-
duced into one of the New York theatres,
and the advantages of the change, especially In
regard to civility, seem to have Impressed a
reporter, who gets quite enthusiastic In his de-
scription of the girls and their quiet method of dis-
charging their duties. “ Would you rather seat
an audience of ladies or of gentlemen ? ” was one
of the questions asked. “ It Is altogether imma-
terial to me,” the young lady answered, “ whom I
seat, so long as they do not insult me. Of course
ladles are Inclined to be more particular than
gentlemen, and to require more attention, which I
suppose they received at the hands of male ushers,
but as a rule they do no fault-finding. I find it
harder to bear the stare of the lar les, because, ’
and here a roguish gleam lit up her eyes, “ it is not
altogether displeasing to a girl to be looked at by
gentlemen. And I think it is only right, If ladies
receive more attestlon from male ushers, that
gentlemen should be shown a little favour
at our hands. Don’t you think that’s fair?”
Alter an emphatic acquiescence in this de-
claration of principles, the young lady was
asked if she had been annoyed at all by that class
of mankind familiarly known as “ mashers.”
‘‘Mashers!” she exclaimed; “well, you should
just have seen them flock here the first week we
were here, after you newspaper men had an-
nounced the change. My I but they made me tired.
They would stand In the lobby, watch us and
smirk as they twirled the few hairs on their upper
lips, and try to look as sweet as pie. But when
they found we would take no notice of them, they
soon began to drop off. I settled one of them one
evening. He had been grinning at me, and when
he finally handed me his coupon, he caught my
hand in his and squeezed it. 1 looked at him, and
then, so that every one around me could hear, I
told him that if he Insulted me again in that
manner I would report him to the male usher. 1
then walked down to where his seat was, but when
I found it he was not to be seen. He had evi-
dently lost all desire to see the play, and had left
the house.”

One of the inspectors of public-houses in
Victoria is handicapped with the name of Herbert
Yorke Rattray, but, nevertheless, he struggles
manfully with the difficulties that obstruct the
conscientious revenue-officer whose business It is
to sample the snake-juice retailed in that colony.
A week or two ago, Herbert (we must dispense
with the rest of the name, as our “ copy slips ” are
running short) was nosing about Ballarat In search
of inferior “James Hennessy,” when he rambled
Into the Mallow Hotel, where the fair Mrs, Barry
and the beautiful Mies Kate Finnegan (of German
parentage) dispensed the soothing beer and mellow
whisky. The eagle eye of the acute grog officer
“spotted" a couple of bottles on the shelves
which were not labelled as the Act directs, and he
forthwith swooped upon them. While entering
up the particulars of this important seizure In his
note-book, he left the bottles standing on the
counter, and when deeply immersed in the forma-
tion of the necessary pnt-hooks and hangers for
recording the case, an old bar-bummer staggere d
in, and, unwittingly or otherwise—it would be vam
far us to say which—fell against the bar-counter,
and, to use the words of the Irish bard,
“All the sweet butthermilk watheredtho plain,”—
the precious liquor, which diffused an arotia like
unto rum, sloshing over, and irretrievably ruining
Mr. Rattray’s best Sunday pants. The ladies could
hardly be expected to suppress a wicked smile as
H. Y. Rattray wandered forth smelling like a dis-
tillery; but .they had to face the music at the
police court a few days afterwards c arged with ob-
structing tbe revenue-officer while in the discharge
of his duty, and, after some pretty steep swearing
on both sides, the bench 1 grew undecided, and the
case went by the boards, as the gentle Kate blush-
ingly stated that the cause of the breakage was
Herbert's unhandiness when sealing up the grog.
Which goes to show that even the man who dally
revels in tasting spirituous liquors on the cheap
has “ little troubles."
The London Echo, which has very good
intentions, Is under the Impression that Otago and
Southland ate In Australia. New Zealand Just now
Is getting all the free-advertising In the London
Press, which has been actually gushing, to the
extent of scores of columns, about the enterprise
of the N. Z. Shipping Co. and the glories of Maori,
land. The fact Is, that though N.S.W. is strong
enough In herself to command respect in London
business circles, Queensland and New Zealand
appear to be considered the most “ gentlemanly
and “ fashionable ” colonies to settle In.
“ By Jove ! Noake has really a startling
novelty In the tobacconist line (if we can call a
tobacco-box a novelty), for this really is one. That
little place in Hunter-street that Westgarth and
Sal way used to occupy as a iaw shop has now gone
through a translormation, and, by Jove, boys!
you wouldn’t know It. It is one of the prettiest,
neatest, and, I might say, the most unique to-
bacco stores you ever saw in all your lives. It is
the most tip-top, stylish, out-of-the-way kind
of thing that we have ever seen since we have
left those big shores in the Atlantic. It puts us in
mind of going down the old streets of New York,
and I have seen something like It when I was
travelling in the little village of London. It does
one’s heart good to see a man like J. Noake having
the pluck to go into a venture of this sort. We
understand he intends making It a real box shop;
but I was very much surprised to hear Irom one
of our fellows that he could purchase anything he
liked, from a box of matches to a five-pound box
of cigars; so that be does not intend to shut us
poor fellows out of seeing his pleasant face when-
ever we like to call. Now, knowing Jack as well
as we do, from old acquaintanceship—and always
found him straight—and with the assistance of
another well-known man, Mr. G. L. Goodman,
‘one of the boys,’ if they don’t make a success it
must be their own fault. Wishing them all the
luck they are entitled to, they will not require to
be in business very long.’'*
Notwithstanding that a paper known as
the Distress is frequently published in Corowa,
the talented editor of that melancholy sheet does
not entirely rely on his own brilliant efforts to
rescue the “ little town on the border”—of civili-
sation, we presume—from permanent oblivion.
His soul was sad when he became aware that we
had some trifling difficulty in “ placing ” the
“ little town,” as he fondly calls it; but his gloom
vanished like an evanescent summer cloud, or a
bottle of rum before a country editor, when the
local fire brigade girt up their loins and started
for Botany to win undying fame and make the
name of Corowa a household word in every
English-speaking community on the earth — a
name that would scintillate with greater efful-
gence than even that of Dapto or—Howlong.
This is how the gifted Leslie throws his immortal
soul Into prose on the occasion:—“The teams
from the Corowa Brigade left for Sydney by the
morning train on Wednesday. This year’s trial is
to prove a decisive one, and to the men who left
for Botany is entrusted the task of sustaining the
reputation of the little town on the border, so far
away that even The Bulletin, which is fond of
poking into holes and corners, could not find it
without a deal of trouble. We may flatter our-
selves that whether our men win or lose their per-
formance will be nothing to be ashamed of, and
that the popular captain is ‘bossing’ as good a
team as ever slung hose together or showed water
in the winning time.” But the fates were against
the noble warriors to whom “ the task of sustain-
ing the reputation of the little town,” &C., was en-
trusted, for they didn’t even secure a place in the
big event at Botany. Consequently, the editor of
the Distress is plunged again Into unutterable
woe, and the popular (captain is wrapped in a
mantle of gloom.
The Chinese cut off the heads of the
Frenchmen killed in battle. Twenty-two heads
were brought Into the Celestial camp after the
Tamsin affair, and were stuck on poles—while the
twenty-two deceased frog-eaters were shrilly
chaunting in the celestial choir or howling else-
where. The girl whom the Chinese Tommy At-
kins “leaves behind him” (unlike the Puritan
maiden, Hrlacllla, who averted her face when the
head of the ‘ brave Wattawamat” was brought
home and placed on the fort at Plymouth, and
who “thanked God in her heart she had not mar-
ried Miles Standish”)—the Mongolian Mary Anne,
we were going to observe, being aware of the
boastful character of the gentleman who is so
familiar to us all as a vegetable-seller, likes to
have some tangible evidence of the valour of her
beloved Ah Sin. This head-hunting episode of
Tamsin reminds us that in the "good old days” a
not inconsiderable trade used to be carried on
between New Zealand and Port Jackson in pre-
served Maori heads, which were sold at high prices
to European and other museums. Before the
white man’s advent In N.Z., the Maori used to pre-
serve no heads except those of his friends killed
in battle; but when it was found that the pakeha
would give a price tor preserved heads it occurred
to the chieis that much coin could be made out of
the trunkless brain-pans of their enemies. By
and bye, the price of heads fell, and there was,
owing to the glutted condition of the market, a
much smaller demat d; so it occurred to the Taw-
hiaos of the day that It would be well to keep the
heads of enemies as trophies of victory. These
ghastly relics, which were most carefully and
Ingeniously preserved, were truly horrible
objects, for the features and tattoo marks
were admirably kept — the hair and beard
were uninjured, and nothing was lost from the
countenance save the eves, which were closed up,
and gave a more death-like appearance to the
whole. Taunting language was made use of to
the heads, as though they could hear and under-
stand. “ What I ” a Maori would say to 1 hese sense-
less objects, “ you wanted to run away, did you ?
But my meri overtook you, and after you were
cooked—you were made food tor my mouth. And
where is your father ? he is cooked; and where is
your brother ? he is t aten; and where is your wife ?
there she sits, a wife for me; and where are your
children ? there they are, with loads on their backs
carrying food, as my slaves.” The head-hunting
business came to a final end in this wise: A gentle-
man—a perfect gentleman, he was—from Sydney,
whose New Zealand head-quarters were at the Bay
of Islands, had been to the southward, where he
had purchased heads to the number of twelve or
fourteen. These heads belonged to chiefs of the
Bay-and neighbourhood, who had been destroyed
only a few weeks before. Some Maoris were on
board his schooner, when the Inhuman wretch
went into his cabin and brought out a bag which
contained the grisly trophies and emptied them
out in the presence of the natives. Some recog-
nised their fathers, others their sons; some their
brothers and other near friends and relations. The
weeping and lamentation caused by the indignity
thus put on the relics of the departed were appall-
ing, and all the Maoris vowed revenge, which they
would have taken at the time had they not been so
few in number. But before they could do this, the
enterprising Sydney gentleman weighed anchor
and sailed out of the bay. However, he was sub-
sequently several times fired on, and had to leave
the North Island. The heads were carried to Port
Jackson and sold; but when the matter was repre-
sented to our paternal Government, an order wag
promulgated forbidding such a degrading traffic in
this colony. When the order came out, tbe Gover-
nor was virulently attacked by some of the Sydney
head-merchants. And these are the people from
whom we are descended 1 No wonder that a lot of
us want to be peers and hide our names 1
HARD FACTS.
Glebe, Sydney, June 20,1884.
Messrs. Elliott Bros.—Dear Sirs,—I am pleased to
Inform you that the Hamburg Tea has afforded me
substantial and, I trust, permanent relief. I suffered
for years from a weak digestion, and was subject
at intervals to severe attacks of biliousness an I
dyspepsia. Since leaving the “ old country ” these
have increased in frequency, and although I have
tried many other preparations, none have suc-
ceeded in yielding me relief. Noticing a case simi-
lar to my own, in which Hamburg Tea affected a
cure, I resolved to give it a trial, and am happy to
say the results were most satisfactory. Headache
—a troublesome symptom in this class of malady—
at once disappeared, and by steady persistence in
its use I experienced a gradual return of health
and vigour, and I have every reason to believe my-
self completely cured.
If this testimony is of any service to you, use it
in any way you please.
Faithfully yours,
A. THOMAS.
[If every Individual and every family would be-
stow a tithe of tbe care requisite in any ordinary
attack of acute disease, in striving- to prevent
and ward off its attacks, there would rarely be any
use for calling in the aid of the physicians. In all
ordinary derangements of the stomach, bowels,
liver, or kidneys, you need only a few doses of
Emil Frese's Hamburg Tea.]
This pretty reception dress, with double apron drapery, is of sky-blue ottoman cord,
with white lace bodice and trimming. The box pleat trimming is seen nearly to the
waist on each side, as only the upper part of the front drapery is joined to the hind
breadths, while the lower scarf disappears. Narrow ribbon velvet bows of a deep blue
colour are on the sleeves, and the same is intermixed with the cascade of lace down
the front 6f the bodice.
