Tlxe Influenza Fiend.!
For such must be considered the'living organism which by its rapid propagation has spread disease and death
throughout the limits of the civiliaed world. The scientists of the period have attributed the prevalence and
transmission of this influenza epidemic to the action of quickly propagating germs, and although keen-eyed and
learned men in England, France and Germany have been searching for this microscopic mischief with unstinting
labour, they have not yet succeeded in isolating the individual germ and learning his habits, his food and his
poison. In the meantime, with no uncertain note, leading physicians in London have recognised in the Austra-
lian Oil of Eucalyptus a germicide that has been pronounced both a preventive of and a cure for Influenza.
In the Lancet of 18th January, 1890, Dr. W. Stephenson Richmond, of Kensington, London, writes; —
“As to the treatment, preventive and curative, I believe enough has not been said about the former.
Believing influenza to be due to a germ, and generally preceded by catarrh, I assume preventive medicine should
aim at destruction of the germ and relief of the congestion. I believe for the former there is nothing to surpass
eucalyptus oil during the present epidemic. I believe it is absolutely preventive, and my experience and observa-
tion of it are not confined to the present epidemic. Eucalyptus destroys the germs, and added to ammonia, which
stimulates the local circulation, forms the.best inhalent for the prevention of the disease X yet know of. I think
it vastly superior to menthol.”—(Signed), W. Stephenson Richmond, M.R.C.S.
In February, 1890, Dr. Brendon Curgenven writes in the Lancet.
To the Editor of the Lancet : “I can fully endorse the experience of Mr. Stephenson Richmond in the use of
Eucalyptus as a preventive of influenza, at recommended by him in the Lancet of 18th January. I have from the
beginning of the epidemic used Eucalyptus disinfectant spray on the handkerchief as a perfume by day, and
sprinkled on the bed pillow for inhalation at night, and have found it most effectual in preventing influenza. In
the cases of old people and invalids, I have directed the spray to be used in their rooms at intervals in the day
and sprinkled on their pillows at night, and I am convinced I have saved many from the disease, when their
servants, who have not taken these precautions, have had it. I have not had the disease myself, although I have
attended upwards of 200 cases. I have experienced the effects of a large dose of the poison several times after
visiting houses where there were many cases. I felt considerable nausea, like that of sea-sickness, and such dizzi-
ness that I could scarcely walk straight, together with great languor. All these symptoms passed away on in-
haling the Eucalyptus with strong inspirations until its warmth could be felt in the chest. It will as effectually
destroy the poisons of other infectious diseases and fevers, and I hope to bring the subject of the use of eucalyptus
in infectious diseases before the Epidemiological Society on 12th March, when I shall prove its powerful effect on
the scarlet fever poison.”—l am, sir, yours faithfully, (Signed), J. Brendon Curoenven, Bayswater, Ist February
1890. *
Bosisto’s “ Parrot ” Brand is both curative and preventive. Its antiseptic principle immedi-
ately destroys all poisonous germs.
Mr. Joseph Bosisto was the first to distil and introduce eucalyptus oil into Europe, and his oil may be known
by the trade-mark, the “ Parrot ” brand. He first exhibited his eucalyptus oil at the Paris Exhibition of 1855
then again in the London Exhibition of 1861, receiving the highest houours for his exhibits. In 1886, the Society
of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce of London (incorporated by Royal Charter in 18X7, and established in 1754)
conferred on Mr. Bosisto the silver medal of the society in recognition of his services to medicine and the arts in
introducing the eucalyptus of the Auslralian flora into the commerce of Europe.
From the earliest years of its introduction into Europe Bosisto’s oil of eucalyptus has filled the European
demand, and will be found in the dispensaries of all the hospitals, and in the laboratories of all the leading
chemists of Europe.
Bosisto’s “ PARROT ” brand Eucalyptus Oil has as trade mark a parrot on the top of the wrapper. See you
get this from your chemist, and so avoid imitations.

which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKED
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large— from 100 up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.

is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
?Mly buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal

Their arse, Symptoms, and Treatment.
This pamphlet is specially written to show a method of
counteracting the ill effects of indiscretions in early life,
over-work, mental worry, &c., and contains a fund of use-
ful information for every sufferer from the following com-
plaints, viz :—Loss of Energy and Will Power, NERVOUS
DEBILITY, Pains in the Back, Defective Memory, Specks
before the Eyes, Excessive Nervousness, Premature
Decay, Bashfulness, Excessive Heart Palpitation, Des-
pondency, Impure Blood, Liver and Kidney Complaints,
Contagious Diseases, and various other symptoms experi-
enced by Nervous Sufferers.
This Pamphlet is sent Free on Application,
and all in any way suffering from the above would derive
benefit from the perusal of this work.
If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore
in need of treatment, he should lose no time in writing
me a letter detailing in full his symptoms, on receipt of
which I will at once reply, explaining the nature of his
complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Smuts) a Permanent and Complete Cure in every case I undertake.
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of investigating the causes of Nervous Diseases, and
become perfectly acquainted with the most approved scientific and successful methods of affecting their cure.
ALL CONSULTATIONS, either by letter or in person, FREE. Hoars of Consultation—From 10 a.in. to 4 p.m.
daily; Saturdays, 10 to 12 a.m. ; and from 7to 9 p.m. on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Address all letters—

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading college 3
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

FREE. A LARGE CLOTH-BO UNO
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
lion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by lire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1891.
A Freetrade Tariff.
During the year that is xxow approaching its
close, business has been prosperous at the
New South Wales Customs House, and the
takings under the alleged Fx-eetrade tariff
have been xnxusually good. It is somewhat
of an anomaly that there should have beexx
any such takings at all, for if Freetrade
xxxeaxxs anything—which we doubt—thexx
there should be no tariff whatsoever-, and no
Customs House, axxd no revenue from duties
of any kind, but that is a mere detail. It is
also somewhat of an anomaly that the
alleged Freetx-ade press should have re-
joiced over the amount extracted from the
consumer, by this same iniquitous tariff,
seeing that it is against its prixxciple—
if it has any principles that there
should be a tariff. But while these jour-
nals pointed to the £2,000,000 per annum
wrested from the Victorian people under
Px-otection as a black and sixxful circum-
stance, they cheered wildly over the
£2,000,000 wrested from the people of New
South Wales under Fx-eetrade, and poixxted
to it as a great and solid evidence of pros-
perity. And while they have never wearied
of complaining that the £2,000,000 levied in
Victoria is an oppressive addition to the
poor man’s burdens, they never once men-
ioned that the same amount levied in New
South Wales is an addition to anybody’s
burdens ; also, when the amount re-
ceived in Customs’ duties in Melbourne
showed signs of increasing they said
that a further outrage was being heaped
on a down - trodden people, and when
the Customs duties of N.S.W. increased in
like manner they stated that the great cause
of liberty was looking up. This strangely
anomalous proceeding is still going on, and
the papers which supported Pakkes because
he levied about £2,000,000 per annum and
called it Freetrade, now curse Dibbs with a
dreadful curse because he proposes to charge
just about the same amount and call it Pro-
tection. Also they keep on demonstrating
with a weary iteration that the money Dibbs
raises will come out of the pockets of the
people, and never once remark that the
same amount, when Parkes raised it, came
out of exactly the same pockets.
# # *
In fact, when they turn on their tears and
lamentations over the fact that the province
is going to have a tariff, the Daily Tele-
graph and the Herald cease to rejoice over
the takings of the New South Wales Customs
department, and invariably forget that
New South Wales has got any tariff’ at all.
It always had one, none the less. It is
called a “revenue tariff,” and is understood
to bo levied only as a matter of necessity,
but the one point which affects the people is
that it is levied. Whatever it is called they
have to pay it, and whether it is described as
a revenue tariff or a dado or a megatherium
the result is the same. The difference
between the Freetrader and the Pro-
tectionist is simply that the former says
there should not be a tariff, and levies one ;
while the latter says that there should be a
tariff, and levies one. Also, the Protec-
tionist levies his tariff on goods that can be
made in the country, and thereby hopes to
raise money and foster local interests at the
same time ; while the Freetrader piles his
exactions upon goods that cannot be made in
the country, and thereby only enhances
prices without fostering any industry at all.
If the Protectionist is deceived in his views,
and his system does not assist industry in
any way, his scheme then leads to exactly
the same results as that of his opponent : it
produces revenue to an equal extent, and
leaves things as they were. The distinction
between the two policies, as exemplified in
New South Wales and the adjacent province,
is that, while taxing the people to a similar
amount, Protection tries to render some
benefit in return, and alleged Freetrade
does not. If Premier Dibbs adopts the 25
per cent, tariff now in fo;ce in Yictoi’ia, the
cornstalk race will keep on paying the
same old oppressive sum per annum which
it pays at present ; therefore, it will lose
nothing, and even if it gains nothing it will
be no worse off. The awful rage of the
bigoted Foreign-trade party is roused merely
because some two-thirds of the nation
desires, in its financial extremity, to try a
remedy which will cost absolutely naught,
and which may do a vast amount of good,
and therefore it calls on the other third to
rise as one man and die lighting for the old
tariff incubus that avowedly does no good
to anybody, and was never intended to.
# # #
Through much hard Foreign-trade lying a
large section of the people of New South
Wales has been taught to regard Protection
merely as a system which puts on duties,
and the fact that it is quite as much a system
which takes duties off is altogether kept out
of sight. In like manner Freetrade, as
px-eached and practised at Sydney, is vaunted
as a great device which takes off duties, and
the circumstance that it also piles them oxx
with a lavish hand is never mentioned. The
duty of 3d. per lb. levied in New South
Wales oxx unmanufactured coffee and cocoa
is strictly a Freetrade duty, and under a
scientific system of Protection it would be
abolished on the ground that it merely
enhanced the price of one of the xiecessaries
of life, without encouraging any possible
industry in return. The Fx-cotrade systexxx,
meanwhile, cares nothing at all as to whether
the prices of the necessaries of life ax’o
enhanced or not —in fact, its chief business
is to enhance pi-ices. The duty upoxx tea
comes into the same categoxy ; it does xxo
good and merely increases tlie cost to the
consumer. The tax of £3 per ton levied
upon rice is a gigantic addition to the price
of a valuable article of food, and as thex-e is
no reasonable px-ospect of growing rice in
New South Wales, this item of the great
Fx-eetrade tariff is also passed oxx to the
retail buyer as an absolutely unprofitable
exaction. Sago is taxed to the extent of
xxearly £lO per ton ; so are tapioca and semo-
and there is a ponderous duty oxx
sugar-all of which, under a system of pure
axxd unadulterated Protection, would be
admitted free 6n the gx-ound that the duties
xxow levied, upoxx them can assist no local
industry whatever, and are oxxly a bald and
naked tax upon the workman’s wages. The
same rules apply to the tax of 3s. 4d. per
cwt. on treacle and molasses—of fid. per
gallon on naphtha and kex-osene - and of ss.
per cwt. on glucose, all of which raise prices
without furnishing cmployxxieut to a single
human being save the Customs-officer. The
chai’ge that is heaved with such wearisome
moxxotony at Protection is that it is simply a
scheme whereby a certaiix percentage is
charged to the consumer, but if the duties
levied in the name of Fx-eetx-ade are not
charged to the coxxsumer, then to whom, in
all the wide world, are they chax-ged ? The
same principle applies to theexcise of 14s. per
gallon upon spirits, of threepence per gallon
on beer, and of Is. 3d. and 2s. (id per lb.,
respectively, upon tobacco and cigars, all of
New South Wales manufacture. They are
paid, and the buyer is beyond a doubt the
only person who can pay them, and there-
fore the curse that is levelled against Protec-
tion fits Freetrade just as well. It is a
ready-made or slop curse, and will fit almost
anything.
*- * #
Apart from these, however, which are
more distinctly Freetrade imposts, having
no effect whatever save to take money out
of the pockets of the poorer classes. New
South Wales is well off for miscellaneous
duties. There is a heavy tax on iron,
which, in Victoria, is admitted free. There
are taxes on beer, ale, porter, cider, bacon,
hams, biscuits, butter, candles, cement,
cheese, chicory, corn-flour, maizena, wire,
confectionery, essences, fish, fruits, jellies,
jams, condensed milk, opium, paints, varnish,
powder and shot, galvanised iron, dynamite,
litho fracteur, salt, sarsaparilla, spirits of all
descriptions, timber, sashes, doors, wines,
and other articles. Many of these duties
would naturally lead to the establishment of
new industries, but wherever it seemed likely
that any particular impost would indirectly
support some industry and furnish employ-
ment to the local population, then some
other impost was carefully put on to crush it
out. The duty on imported sweets might
have heljied along the local confectioners,
and supplied work and wages for many
individuals who wanted both very badly ; so
a duty was placed on sugar and essences—
the necessary raw material of the trade—to
extinguish them, and therefore sugar and
confectionery are both materially iucreased
in price without any good results ensuing.
There was danger, at one time, that the
manufactiu’e of machinery and iron-work
might start in the province, therefore taxes
were piled up on paints, varnish, oils, and
other sundries employed in the business to
suppress this nefarious tendency to advance-
ment, and ready-made machinery was ad-
mitted free. This was Protection in its
baldest form—Protection, that is, to the
European cheap artisan, and against the
Australian. A heavy duty was placed
on foreign spirits, and, lest the distil-
ling business might get a footing, an
equally ponderous impost was placed on local
spirits. The charge upon doors, window-
sashes, and shutters looked as if it might
boom the woodware factories of New South
Wales, consequently timber was taxed to
keep'the business in a proper state of sub-
jection. Everywhere the rule of the
Foreign-traders was, when they saw a new
industry, to hit it, and this rule has been
adhered to so religiously, and the beauties of
it have been expounded so long and so per-
sistently by the Daily Telegraph, and the
Herald, and the Echo, and the Evening
News, that the ancient superstition still has
some few adherents in New South Wales,
and though dead it persists in festering
above-ground, and obstinately refuses to be
buried.
# # #
Another peculiar feature of the New South
Wales “Freetrade tariff” is that it is in the
strictest sense of the term a charge upon the
poor. There is no impost on watches,
diamond rings, brooches, gold bangles,
pianos, organs, carpets, carriages, furniture
—it is only the expensive variety of furni-
ture that is imported, and imported furniture
is the luxury of the rich ; the poor man’s
deal table is heavily taxed under the heading
of “dressed timber”—optical instruments,
marble, pictures and paintings, silver plate,
or any other single article that is the exclu-
sive luxury of the capitalist. This intense
anxiety on the part of the wealthy Foreign-
trade law-makers to prevent any tax being
levied which might-, by any chance, increase
the price of their particular indulgences, and
their fixed resolution to shunt all possible
charges on to the poor, explains the great
difference between Protection and Freetrade.
The latter goes by no defined rule; it sticks on
duties anywhere and calls them a “ revenue
tariff,” and thus the members of a Freetrade
Legislature have a favourable opportunity—
of which they always avail themselves—to
pass the burden on to someone else.
Protection travels on the policy of
taking off all imposts which cannot aid
any local industry, and putting on duties
which promise to do so, and under a
tariff formed on true Protectionist prin-
ciples, the duty now levied on sugar would
be shifted on to jewellery, and the kerosene-
tax —which presses on the poor, for the rich
man uses gas or electricity—would be planted
on pianos, and the impost would be removed
from raw coffee and cocoa and charged to
carpets and carriages, and sago would come
in frePjWvhile the tariff would come down
heavily %x imported furniture, marble, and
silver plate. Protection takes no note of
whether it levies upon the poor or the rich
or both, but in pursuit of its unvarying
principle it would make a woeful smash of
the privileges hitherto enjoyed by the rich
Foreign - traders of New South Wales,
whereby they shunt 99 per cent of the taxes
upon the labouring class, and call it liberty.
# # #
All this brings us back once more to our
starting point. Protection is not, as the
Foreign-trade press perpetually asserts, a
mere scheme for putting on Customs-duties,
for it takes off almost as much as it puts on.
And Freetrade is not, as its deceptive title
would imply, and as its mercenary advocates
declare, a policy whereby duties are taken
off, for it puts on as many taxes as it r e
moves. The incidence of taxation is shifted
but the taxation is there all the time. The
experience of Victoria has proved that a 25 p er
cent protective tariff costs the nation almost
exactly the same as does the present Freetrade
tariff of New South Wales. Therefore, when
the morning papers of Sydney rave about
the duties which will—in their favourite
phrase—be “passed on to the consumer,” it
is only necessary to answer that the amount
to be passed on to that unhappy and much-
advertised consumer bids fair to be just the
same amount which is passed on to him now
And when the grey-headed, toothless wheeze
about the “burden of taxation” comes
again to the front, it is worth remembering
that the burden is there already, that it has
always been there, and that even if Free-
trade were to last for ever the same old
burden would be there to the end of time. For
the “ load ” which has roused the bile of so
many dreary publications is simply the
amount paid by the nation at the Customs-
house, and when Freetrade and Protection
charge the same amount there is nothing to
shriek about. Meanwhile Protection under-
takes to make the old burden profitable, and
as tlie experiment costs nothing, and as Free-
trade can only guarantee to make the incubus
of taxation the same useless dead-weight as
before, it is at least worth while to make the
attempt. Even if the scheme were the in-
evitable failure which the Herald and the
Daily Telegraph foretell, it is better to fail
in the effort to do something than only to
succeed in doing nothing at all.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Another “Bank.”
The Northumberland Banking Company, which
recently went the way of all New South Wales
monetary flesh, is now going through the usual
process of the Sydney law-courts. It was a con-
cern which did a large business—and had at the
outset £73 10s. of available capital. Most of the
founders of the institution, it would appear,
paid up their shares by opening a current
account at the “bank,” paying nothing what-
ever into the account, and giving a cheque upon
it for the amount of their calls ! Very frequently,
accordingto the evidence, when a£so call became
due, the authorities went down to the office,
borrowed £75 without security, paid the call
out of it, and backed a horse with the differ-
ence, and consequently the more capital that
was paid the more desperately hard-up becanje
the Northumberland Banking Company. When
the employes wanted money, which they seem
to have done incessantly, they took it promis-
cuously out of the till, and when things reached
that point at which the ordinary banker’s clerk
would be run into gaol, this bank simply put
down the steals as “ officers’ advance account.”
When this account grew altogether too imposing
the plunder was sometimes put down as “sus-
pense account,” by way of variety. The
managing director seems to have applied to
himself for an overdraft without security, and
after duly considering his own unblemished
character and undoubted solvency, he gave
himself written authority to draw up to £5OO.
The managing director’s children both borrowed
money without security from the company,
and took up shares with it. The “general
manager ” paid £l5 on his shares, and borrowed
£7l 10s. to help him do it. The officers
furnished their houses out of the bank’s assets,
and some of them bought buggies and horses,
and paid for them with the deposits. Some of
the cheques drawn by one of the directors were
payable to “ Adam Bede ” (a sweep-promoter),
and a lot more were payable to various race-
horses, from which it is surmised that a good
deal of the funds went in gambling larks. The
simple rule of the Northumberland Banking
Co. seems to have been that whenever an officer
received a deposit he rushed out and “blewed”
it in clothes, or champagne, or jewellery, or
anything. Like the sparrows, the bank took no
thought for the morrow, and when it broke
there was about £9O on hand altogether, divided
among one head office and five branches. The
saddest branch of the lot had got through every-
thing except 3s. 2d., and the total amount
owing to depositors was £17,119 15s. fid. Also,
there was £1 to the company’s credit in the
Union Bank. Braund, a combination clerk
and auditor, who might have thrown some
further light on these matters, was found
drowned the other evening, but whether he
came to grief by accident, or whether he jumped
in to avoid cross-examination, or whether one
of his friends shoved him in to smother his
evidence, doesn’t appear. There never were
any directors’ meetings at the Northumberland
Banking Co. The managing director ran the
entire business in his own riotous fashion;
but other people apparently used to drop
in and empty the till now and then, and
therefore they may naturally desire to keep
things dark. Among the later revelations a
witness has been found who used to charge his
groceries and his draper’s and wine-merchant’s
bills to the bank, and other interesting items
are coming out daily. So far—strangely
enough —nobody has been put into gaol over
the business, and no depositor has shot a
director in a dark corner, nor has any enraged
mob hanged the manager on a telegraph-post.
Possibly, however, the creditors are only lying
low. The history of the Northumberland
Banking Co., as set forth in the daily news-
paper reports, is far stranger than aiiything in
the history of Mr. Montague Tigg.
♦
The Case of Edward Bell.
A few weeks ago The Bulletin published
sundry comments on the case of Edward Bell,
recently sentenced in Melbourne to four years’
imprisonment for burglary, and expressed its
opinion that the conviction was an almost
unparalleled instance of judicial stupidity. The
evidence against Bell was as follows: A


certain householder, named Larck, was
awakened by a burglar, and after a desperate
scrimmage in a dark room he wrested a coat-
tail off the intruder’s clothes, just as that
unlawful person fled through the window.
The only two things—judging by his report to
the police —which he was sure about in the
darkness and the excitement were the aforesaid
coat-tail, and the fact that the visitor was a
man of great size and ferocity. The police
thereupon arrested Bell—a miserably small,
stunted, undersized individual, as little like
LabCK’s description as a horse is like a dog —
the principal evidence against him being tliat
lie wore a pair of pants corresponding in
material to the captured coat-tail. He was
exhibited to the prosecutor —that is to say, the
latter individual wasn’t asked to pick him out
of, say, a dozen prisoners, but was simply
asked if Bell was the man ; and be promptly
identified him, just as he would, most likely,
have identified Long M‘Kean or “General
Mite ” if his attention had been drawn in the
same way to either of them. Also, he swore to
him in the Court, regardless of the awful dis-
crepancy between the size of the prisoner, and
that of the burglar as revealed by his own
description. Bell’s only defence was that the in-
criminating pants were given to him by some per-
son whom he couldn’t trace —being locked up in
gaol he couldn’t naturally trace anybody ; and
the jury promptly found him guilty, and the
Judge —regardless of Mr, Larck’s really sur-
prising statements —sent him up for four years.
This event took place some four months
ago, and within the past few days the real
offender —one Giles, who is now doing 14
years on his own account—confessed to the
crime. Giles and an accomplice gave the
pants to Bell, and as a further stretch of
humour they took the detective along, and
pointed Bell out to that functionary. The
officer, in fact, seems to have arrested his
victim simply because a shady-lookiug stranger
told him to do it, and apparently lie never even
asked how the stranger came by bis informa-
tion. Giles and his friend and supporter have
now been convicted of conspiracy to charge Bell
with the crime of burglary, but, so far, nothing
seems to have happened to Mr. Larck, whose
fluent and copious testimony certainly had
much to do with that miserable victim’s dis-
aster. No doubt if the burglar had committed
murder upon some member of the household to
facilitate his escape, Mr. Larck would have
sworn just as fluently, and long before this time
Bell would have been banged and forgotten.
Then, iu all probability, the truth would never
have been revealed, for no one worries much
about a dead man, and he would have gone
the same way as many other dead men who
fell victhiis to police stupidity, and circum-
stantial evidence, and the readiness of many
witnesses to take a prisoner’s guilt for
granted merely because he is in custody. And
even if the truth had come out iu that case, it
would have done remarkably little good to any-
body concerned. There is no return road from
the gallows, and hanging is the only mistake
for which the law can make no possible repara-
tion. And for that reason capital punishment
badly wants to be abolished. So long as the
law is a blundering institution, which depends
for its accuracy on the brains of unintelligent
policemen, who depend, in their turn, on hazy
witnesses and shady-looking strangers who
appear mysteriously at street corners, it is an
unspeakably rash thing for any court to commit
itself to an act from which there is no going
back. By pure accident, however, Bell has
been “pardoned ” instead of hanged. In other
words, the law, which did him a brutal wrong,
graciously forgives him for having the wrong
done to him. It is an unspeakable proceeding,
and the only thing the State can do now to
make it complete is to charge Bell for board
and lodging during the time be was in gaol, and
for wear and tear of the policeman who ran him
in, and for the use of the Judge who sentenced
him, and to send him a bill for the rent of the
witnesses who swore so profusely against him.
Lynch Law and Other Matters.
“Vulcan ” writes to The Bulletin as follows;
I have been a constant reader of The Bulletin for years,
and have carefully read your articles re capital punish-
ment, but must say my observation and experiences,
reaching from the year 1837 till the present date, in Tas-
mania, New South Wales, Victoria and California, do not
lead me to endorse your views. My firm belief is that as
long as such human wolves and monsters as Lynch,
Knatchbull, Sullivan, Vigers, Burdett, Lester, or Nicholls,
are barn, society, as the majority, is justified in depriving
them of the pleasure of committing a second or third
murder. You propose to confine such monsters for life.
How many valuable lives have been sacrificed to tliat idea
or whim? It is not long since a murderer in New Cale-
donia made his escape, and the Kanaka police sent to
arrest him had to drive a spear through him to do so.
That monster had committed seven murders, and had
been condemned to death four times ; and wdiat can be
expected of suoli scoundrels but that they will be con-
tinually plotting and scheming to regain their liberty,
not caring how' many more murders they commit in doing
so, because they know that they cannot lie awarded any
additional punishment, unless it took the shape of
tortur*, and I am sure you wouldn’t countenance
that. I am quite sure tliat if the abolition of
capital punishment party will give security that their pets
will never make their escape and commit a second
murder, that those who are now in favour of the rope
will cheerfully hand all homicides over to them to deal
with. I know' from personal experience and observations
that Human Wolves are born as regularly as human
sheep, and that the only effectual way to protect the
sheep is to kill the wolves. You talk about the brualising
effects of capital punishment. How could it brutalise if
it were carried out strictly in private? My opinion is
that the public trial and the reports and comments on the
press have a far worse effect than the execution, which
the general public never see. Do you believe that the
citizens of the great republic, who sometimes assist in
lynching a murderer, are more brutal than any
place where the British flag flies, and where such
things never occur, but where what is called the
lower orders amuse themselves by kicking women to
death witli hobnailed boots, fighting vicious asses for
gallons of beer, or backing themselves to kill mo.e rats in
a pit than a terrier dog, although very few of them ever
saw a man executed ? You seem to think that crime is a
hydra sort of affair, and tliat it is not advisable to cut
oil the head ot a murderer as it only encourages otlieis
to become murderers. Well, I never knew of acase where
after a man was hanged for murder half-a-dozen
others went and committed murder so that , they
wight he hanged likewise. But I do know that in the
early days of the diggings in California great numbers of
scoundrels wentjfrom the Austialian colonies to California,
which they couldn't have done if they had been hanyed at
home, and the citizens of San Francisco, in self-defence,
found it necessary to form a vigilance committee, with
the result that some of the scoundrels were hanged and
others were notified to quit, and the honest and quiet
Australian colonists were never afraid of tlie vigilants or
Judge Lynch., I also know that in those early days the
wiuers could leave their gold and other belongings in
their tents without fear, it being known that thieving
meant death. I also know that in the early days of the
rush to Bendigo and Forest Creek, with all the circum-
stances just the same as in California, that the diggers
used to take their puddling tubs, windlasses, and ropes (o
their tents at night to prevent them being stolen, as the
Victorian thieves had no fear of Judge Lynch or any other
judge. With regard to lynching, it is my opinion that it
is as necessary as vaccination, quarantine, or revolution,
to stamp out crime when the regular laws of the country
fail to do so, as they have often done in the past, and no
doubt will in the future. I challenge anybody to prove
that there lias been more miscarriages of justice under
Lynch law than under the regular laws of any country
in the world. I myself am sure that there have not
been one-twentieth as many. I understand you to
say that crime is the effect, and bad laws or vicious en-
vironments are the cause. 1 maintain that circumstances
never made a good man bad, or a bad man good,
I think you will admit that the people of Ireland have
been cursed with had laws for five or six hundred
years. Now, are the Irish more criminally inclined
in their native country than when they emigrate to other
countries, where they are under good laws and have more
liberty ? My experience is quite the contrary.
There are just about tour points in this letter
that are worth answering. The writer seems
to assume, in the first place, that all men who
are hanged are such as Lynch, Knatchbull,
Nicholls. and a few more, and that The
Bulletin desires the abolition of capital punish-
ment expressly to save Lynch, Knatch-
bull, and Co. from the gallows. The
individual who assumes things so recklessly
as that is surely unable to read print. The
few exceptional monsters he quotes are only
about 1 per cent, of those who reach the
gallows, and—so far as can be judged from all
available evidence—for every time the law hangs
a man like Knatchbull, it also hangs about
three innocent men by mistake. It is chiefly
for the sake of the innocent men whom the law
murders in its blundering efforts to find
Knatchbull that The Bulletin wants to see
capital-punishment abolished, for execution is
the one legal blunder which can never be
atoned for when the truth comes to light.
Secondly, the writer asserts that the Australian
criminals who went to California couldn’t have
gone there if they had been hanged before they
started. This is obviously true; also, the
embezzler couldn’t have embezzled if be had
been hanged before lie started embezzling, and
the drunkard couldn’t have drunk if he had
been executed before ho commenced drinking,
and it is obviously necessary, on this basis,
to bang everybody. Thirdly, he asserts
that lynch - law leads to no more mis-
carriages of justice than docs the ordi-
nary' process of the judge and the hangman.
Perhaps it doesn’t, for there is no reliable
record in either case. Lastly, he states
that “ circumstances never made a good
man bad or a bad man good.” Perhaps
not. Religion, civilisation, education, law—
lynch and other varieties —are all circumstances,
and if they make no difference, then let them
all be abolished. —Ed. B.]
o
□ell the State Hallways? Never!
Whenever New South Wales is itiore than
usually hard-up—which is a matter of frequent
occurrence—the question of selling the railways
invariably comes to the front, and there is much
talk concerning a certain vague and unspecified
syndicate, which would gladly take over these
properties at a cash valuation of £40,000,000.
The huge deficiency which Parkes left behind
him has again brought this matter to light, and
one of the Sydney Sunday papers publishes a
massive array of figures, showing the benefits
which would ensue when a crowd of foreign
speculators took over the principal asset of the
State. At the present moment, New South Wales
is tottering under a burden of debt, and if the
syndicate really exists, and if its £40,000,000 is
veritable cash, and not a mere visionary pile of
gold on fixed deposit in the clouds, the sale
would wipe out about four-fifths of the incubus
iii one act. The saving to the Treasury iu
interest would be enormous; the problem
of bow new loans are to be raised to repay the
old ones, which are now beginning to fall due
with awful regularity, would be got rid of; the
nightmare of the annual railway deficit would
bo removed ; and in a general way the
country would breathe again. This is the
case for the syndicate, and it looks remark-
ably well. But there is another side to the
question. The syndicate would borrow its
£40,000,000 in England, just as the New South
Wales Government has done, most of it,
probably, on debentures; therefore, New
South Wales would have to pay the interest to
the English debenture-holders just as it docs
now, and the load wouldn’t be shifted one soli-
tary inch. Under one system the Government
has to raise the money, somehow, from the
people of New South Wales; under the other,
the syndicate would have to raise it, also from
the people of New South Wales. The people
must pay in either case. If the syndicate suc-
ceeded in abolishing the annual deficiency, it
must do it either by increasing the rates—at the
expense of the people, or by reducing wages
and importing cheap labour —likewise at the
expense of the people ; the people defray the
annual shortage now, and they would do it then
also. The nation pays 3i or 4 per cent, on the cost
of construction at present; but as the syn-
dicate would have a monopoly iu all the
more thickly peopled parts of the province,
and its charges would not be limited by
competition, it would probably work things
up till it extracted from the country divi-
dends of 8 or 10 per cent.—in other words, the
country would pay twice as much as it does
now, and its burden would ultimately be
doubled instead of relieved. The syndicate
would not go in for railway extension except
where population was comparatively thick ; if
lines were wanted for the purpose of “ opening
up the country ” they would have to be made
by Government as heretofore, whereby the
State would presently own the unprofitable
railways, and the profitable ones would
belong to the great monopoly. The change,
at the very best, would be a change
of names—not of facts. If a great Rail-
way Trust were formed, and £40,000,000 or
so of the national debt were transformed into
special railway debentures, and the Treasurer
simply dropped the railway accounts and the
railway debt out of Ids financial statement
altogether, and the Trust were authorised to
raise rates and reduce wages to any extent, and
knocjc off deadheads, and do anything under
the sun so long as it paid its way —the effect
for the present would be just as good. For
the future, however, it would be better, for
when the Trust began to realise 8 per cent pro-
fits iu some far-off day to come, these profits
would go back to the Treasury, instead of
going to private Capitalists. And, meanwhile,
the national debt would be reduced in one act
to £10,000,0 )0, and if the Railway Trust still
owed the other £40,000,000 to the British
money-lender it wouldn’t matter —the syndicate
would have owed it in like maimer, and botli
ways New South Wales must pay the bill.
Also the members of the Trust could be paid
by a percentage on the profits—just as the
syndicate would be paid, and with this incen-
tive, and unlimited powers, they would
assuredly make the railways pay, or die iu the
attempt. Even a syndicate couldn’t do more
than that.
The cause of David Syme’s attacks upon The
Bulletin is wounded envy. His amour propre
has been stabbed by the celebrity—call it
“ notoriety ” or “ infamy ” and we are equally
pleased—which The Bulletin has attained in
England and elsewhere. Syme has read in his
own paper that the «Age has a circulation of
100,000 a day, but even Scotchmen do not live
by bread alone. The Age’s circulation is all in
the little Cabbage-garden,- and so is nineteen-
twentieths of the ponderous Leader’s; “The
Bulletin is everywhere, and everywhere it is
influential,” writes its critic, Christie Murray,
in the Contemporary Review. The see saw
Age has been at work for 30 years, and came
into David Syme’s hand ready-made by the
brain of his dead brother, Ebenezer. The
Republican Bulletin has sprung up within
eleven years, and is now better-known all
over the world than any other Australian
paper. The Age is only known within the
boundaries of its own little cockatoo-squattage.
It has turned its back on Radicalism and prints
leaders extolling Kingdom and Quecndom as
against Republicanism, the Australian destiny.
The nerve-centres of David Syme, like those of
all the proprietors of soi-disant “ groat ” Aus-
tralian daily newspapers, are in England, not in
the country which has, at least metaphorically,
converted them from living skeletons into
ham-fat men. Nobody in England notices
Syme and liis publications, which never by
any chance print any original matter that
travels the rounds of the world’s press. Hence
Syme squeals.
o-
The Bulletin hereby calls upon the N.S. W.
Foreign-trade party to exhibit the courage of
its convictions, and to vote solidly against Mr.
Sheldon’s Bill prohibiting the indenting of
cheap aliens to swamp the labour-market ot the
province. The objection to these aliens is that
they reduce wages and increase competition,
but it is only the produce of their labour that
increases competition, and whether they grind
out that produce on the spot, or whether
they simply send it along per cargo-
steamer, the I’esult is the same—it gets
here iu either case, and it is the fact
of its getting here that causes the trouble.
Mr. Sheldon’s Bill is Protection of the most
unvarnished description, and if the Foreign-
trade party doesn’t oppose it, and if the Daily
Telegraph doesn’t write a series of frantic
leaders against it, then they are basely desert-
ing their principles in the hope of catching the
Labour-vote. We are waiting anxiously for
the Telegraph to shriek on this point, but up
to the time of writing it has either meanly
neglected the whole matter or else it has
shrieked in a whisper that was quite inaudible.
The Melbourne Gas Co. rulers have reduced
the wages of stokers, firemen, and engine-
drivers by sixpence and a shilling per day, “ on
account of the contemptible meanness of house-
holders in reducing their meter consumption.”
At the present moment the directors couldn’t
feel sure of paying a 20 per cent dividend for
the half year unless they knocked 0 to 10 per
cent off the moneys of their hardest-worked
employes. Secretary Vasey, by the way, talks
about “ the prevailing general depression ” as a
calamity which must necessarily affect every-
body except his bloated shareholders in a
monopoly which is no less sinful, though better
managed, than that under which Sydney groans
and grumbles. Depression in gas consumption
will gradually increase as the electric-light
comes along, and the Melbourne public will
find the price, per thousand feet, going gradu-
ally up, whilst the price of stokers works slowly
downward. But shareholders will continue to
draw their time-honored dividends, somehow,
until a “ distinguished visitor ” stumbles across
the gas scandal, and explains in a London
magazine article that Australians submit to
impositions that would stir the downtrodden
Cockney to rebellion.

Mathias Larkin, the fashionable Melboiune
swindler, was interviewed by an Age reporter
just after his moral bubble burst. The remarks
made by Mr. Larkin on this occasion need to
be read thoughtfully through the nose iu a
monotone, and along with a humble snuffle, to
bring out their full flavour. Here are a few
samples:—
The amount of my deficiencies will not amount to more
than £lO,OOO. I cannot exactly say where the money has
gone to. As far as £3OOO or £4OOO is concerned, I might
just as well have thrown it into the Bay for ail the real
benefit 1 received from it. Can’t say what I did with it.
I have made my bed, so must I lay on it. Several of my
friends are at work to effect an arrangement, but no one
has any authority to act on my behalf. A gentleman
came here to-day and offered mo £7500. He and I are in
partnership in a certain business in which 1 have a similar
amount sunk. At the office of the society to-day three
offers of £lOOO, £4OOO, and £3OOO were made, and as much
more would be forthcoming if it were required. Mr.
Skinner, the caterer, will also assist me to the extent of
£3OOO. Even the poor people are treating me with the
most considerate kindness. No, my land speculations did
not prove particularly bad. The face value of tire land I
hold is more than ample to requite all my obligations.
The Yarra Bank Land Company owes me £2OO, and I
have £OOO to draw from the South Wharfage Company.
The Suburban Land Company has to give me a cheque
for £l5O. being interest I paid on its account to the bank
last balancing day. This undertaking is in the bands of
a private syndicate, of which I am a member. It lias a
lot of valuable property which will be realisable some
day. Yes, I have been very foolish, but the bast of us
will trip sometimes. The papers, with onq exception,
hive treated me fairly and kindly, and I am glad I have
ha 1 the oppoitunity of unburthening my overtaxed
fellings. Good day, sir, and thank you.
This awful specimen of smug complacency can’t
be appreciated all at once—it needs to be
allowed to soak in. What Brother Larkin
frankly admits is that he is a rich man who
stole poor people’s savings from sheer greed and
dog-meanness. The papers, he says, treated
him “fairly;” that is to say, they let him
down very, very softly, and not one of
them mentioned what an irredeemable
snuffling hypocrite he was, but merelv
alluded to him as a gentleman struggling
under the pressure of misfortune. As he calls
this treating him “ fairly,” he evidently thinks
that the description fits exactly. But the apex
of Larkin’s cheek—the great pinnacle of gall
that rises like a cat hedral tower out of the dead
waste of his soul-blasting effrontery—is his
remark: “I have been very foolish, but the
best of us will trip sometimes.” If it costs
£lO,OOO when the fatted Mathias only trips,
he would be a dreadfully expensive man
on the occasion of a complete fall ;
and if he is “ foolish ” when he prigs £lO,OOO,
how much would he prig if he were a
complete idiot ? Why doesn’t he put the
situation in plain English, and say: “The
meanest skunk will be found out now and then?”
The promise of an inquiry into the
attaching to a certain Australian Judge is
scarcely sufficient to satisfy public sentiment.
We have unfortunate experience of depait-
mental inquiries, and nothing less than an
investigation by a select committee will serve
to allay the alarm and suspicion which have
been engendered by public imputations of
insolvency and gross misconduct. A member
of one of the labor organisations has brought
the matter in question prominently forward,
and improved considerably upon the allega-
tions which have already appeared in print.
The venerable gentleman indicated cannot
afford to affect disdain or ignorance in regard
to what is published and said respecting
his actions and character. A great statesman
may shamelessly exhibit his seamy exterior,
but a Judge cannot and must not. He is paid
not alone for the exercise of the “cunning,
wisdom, and discretion ” specified in his com-
mission, but for “ grace to execute justice and
to maintain truth.” Prayers are offered up
each week for the preservation of his integrity
and rectitude, and jf a man so distinguished
from his fellows can be proved to live the
reverse of a wholesome and exemplary life, ho
should be not retired but dismissed the public
service. Neither roue nor kite-flyer is entitled
to draw pension from the exchequer.
The insolence of Judge Harding (a unm who
has many times, between the dates of the
Swanwick contempt of court incident and the
recent shearers’ trial, shown himself utterly
unfit to act in even the meanest judicial capa-
city) is again to the fore. A email boy of 13
years was called before him at Brisbane the
other day, and said, in reply to the foolish
queries usually asked of juvenile witnesses,
that he didn’t go to Sunday-school, and that he
didn’t know there was a God —a question which,
if submitted in its Sunday-school sense to a
bench of sound logicians unbiassed by precon-
ceived opinions, would, we venture to say,
occasion much argument. “What arc you?”
asked the Judge. “I am a Freethinker,”
replied the small boy. The Court laughed, but
there was really nothing to laugh at, for the
small boy only said what he had been taught
by his parents to say, just as any Protestant or
R.C. small boy would have done ;
Mr. Mansfield suggested tliat a solution of the difficulty
might be found in the new Oaths Act, a copy of which
was soon procured. If is Honor, after perusing its pro-
visions, found that it did not apply to a case such as this.
It only dealt with persons having a religious belief. After
further consideration his Honor suddenly remarked, “I
can treat him as a blackfellow.” The hoy's countenance
fell painfully. “Or under the Kanaka Act,” suggested
Mr. Mansfield. His Honor then asked the lad if lie
understood that in case lie did not speak the truth he
would be punished. The answer being in the affirmative,
the boy’s evidence was taken
despite Judge Harding’s brutal and gratuitous
insult. The legislatures of all civilised countries
having agreed to respect the affirmations of
persons having no religious belief, it is not
for this overpaid man Harding to flout the
principle as embodied in the laws of the asinine
country which has seated him upon its bench.
George Black, M.L.A., who has lately been
writing, in Sydney Evening News, a series of
jaundiced articles on Melbourne, as viewed
from a strictly Foreign-trade standpoint, winds
up by committing himself to the Single-tax
theory in these words ;
On the other hand, there can he no absolutely freetrade
until Custom Houses arc abolished. Piior to the accom-
plishment of this radical change, the goal of the true
freetrader, some other method of collecting revenue must
be substituted. I know of no better, as social conditions
arc at present, than the resumption into the hands of
their creators-the entire community—of unimproved
land values Iw taxation. This attained, much will he
accomplished, nevertheless reform will not here find its
goal, but only its starting point.
This is tt noble theory, but The Bulletin
respectfully asks Mr. Black, as it asks all
Single-taxers, to have the courage of bis con-
victions, and preach confiscation openly. Like
every other Single-taxer, he assumes that when-
ever the land is resumed the income arising
therefrom will pay all the expenses of Govern-
ment. Therefore he must mean remorseless
confiscation, for if the Government compensated
the present landholder it must borrow a gigantic
sum to do it, and the interest on that sum would
swallow up the rents, and leave the ordinary
expenses of the State to be met by the Customs
House as before. And, unluckily, confiscation
doesn’t only mean the despoiling of the big
capitalist who has other resources to fall back
upon ; it means that, the workman is to be
deprived of the little suburban allotment for
which he has already paid twice its value, and
the small farmer is to be plundered of his
selection, and there is to be general ruin
all round. The Single tax-cwm-Foreigu-trade
individual never dares to go into details about
how his millennium is to be created ; he only
talks about how it will be after it is created,
and publishes diatribes against other people
because they decline to carry out the policy
which he will not even formulate, and to
accept the odium which he won’t take himself.
Land Nationalisation and Protection or Single-
tax and Foreign-trade—there are the two alter-
natives, and the country must choose bet wee
them.

The “National” Conservative Union, repre*
senting the great, solemn, stupid Tory party in
Great Britain and Ireland, has been in congress
at Birmingham. It has decided unanimously
to encourage the formation of a Labour-party
in the House of Commons, which is a surprising
item for the ancient images to put upon their
programme—only as it happens it is merely put
there to catch votes, and doesn’t mean any-
thing. For the Union also decided against the
abolition of plural voting, so as to make quite
sure that no Labour-party will come into exis-
tence ; it resolved that land shouldn’t be taxed ;
it moved and seconded and carried a resolution
for the disqualification of illiterate voters, and
as these number many scores of thousands in
Great Britain this, in itself, will be a woeful
blow to any possible Labour-party ; and it
decided that the grand old Established Church
shall be kept up as before in Wales by seizing
the heretical farmers’ and workmen’s tables and
chairs and bedding, and selling them at auction
for the parson’s benefit. And as the Union,
with Salisbury at its head, has thus solemnly
resolved to do everything in its power to crush
out any new democratic party that might other-
wise be formed, it doesn’t seem to matter much
whether it has any theoretical yearnings after
democracy or not. It is the same bigoted in-
stitution, despite all its disguises, and though it
puts shiny boots on its cloven hoofs, and coils
up its scaly tail and hides it in its pocket,'its
identity glares out conspicuously all the time.

A common fallacy exists in the idea cherished
bv the pastoralists that the present fall of 3d. a
pound all round in the market price of wool
arises from the over-production caused by
the enormous yearly augmentation of “ Woolly
Kangaroos.” As a matter of fact, the in-
creased output of the Southern Hemisphere
is counterbalanced by the diminished returns
of the Northern wool - growing countries.
The cause must, therefore, be sought elsewhere.
Perhaps the nearest explanation is to be found
in the late mechanical improvements which
have enabled cloth-makers to produce more
cheaply than hitherto, and which, strangely
enough, react on the growers of the staple.
Next the large consumption by the masses of
shoddy and cotton goods, which latterly have
been turned out of hand so admirably finished
as to deceive the eyes of all but the most
experienced in woollens. Lastly, the heavy
percentage charged by English and Continental
broking, shipping and selling rings has contri-
buted towards lessening the prime values of
Australian wools. In spite of all these, this
class has no cause to complain seeing that, while
the value of sheep for mutton was, prior to the
frozen-chamber invention, about 25., the present
price averages four times that sum.

A barrister sends us the following clipping,
from the (London) Law Times of 11th October.
1891 :
The Recent Operation of tub Death Penalty.— The
official returns, in the annual “ Judicial Statistics,” show
that during the ten years—lB79 to 1888, inclusive—in
England and Wales, 672 persons were committed for trial
for “wilful murder’’(not including manslaughter or non-
capital homicides). Of these 299 were convicted and sen-
tenced to death, whilst 373 were either acquitted or found
insane (viz., 231 acquitted and 142 found insane). Of the
299 condemned to death nearly one-half, or 145, had their
sentences commuted, whilst 154 were executed. These
299 included 50 women, of whom 9 only were hanged.
Daring this decade the convictions resulting from all
cases of legal procedure (including summary convictions
and fines) averaged 79 per cent.; whilst the convictions
resulting from all criminal trials (indictable offences)
averaged 77 per cent.; whereas in capital cases the con-
victions only averaged 45 per cent., and the actual inflic-
tions of the punishment of death barely reached 23 per
cent. So that persons charged with murder have many
more chances of escaping conviction than any other class
of offenders. For nearly 15,090 known murders in the
United States in.the six years, 1881-1839 inclusive, only 558
persons, or less than 4 per cent, were legally executed,
while 975 were illegally “lynched.” Further, there were a
largo number of suicides, and probably very many unre-
ported murders. In the four States where the capital
penalty is abolished, conditions are stated by competent
authorities to be less unsatisfactory than elsewhere. The
lynchings nearly all take place in States which retain the
gallows. In spite of the utmost care, it is known that
even the strongest circumstantial evidence has sometimes
led to the conviction and death of absolutely innocent
persons. There is much reason to conclude that, for
example, Wiggins, hanged in Ldndon in 1867, Hayes and
Stone, of Durham, 1873, and two of the three men hanged
at Leicester in 1877, with various others recently executed
in foreign countries, were put to death by mistake. And
in 1890 circumstances transpired which afford reason to
fear that a man named Blagg was hanged by mistake for
another man, at Chester, 1855. The evidence against
Blagg was wholly circumstantial, and mainly turned on
the'discovery of a shoe near the body of the murdered
man. It now appears that on the night of the murder
another person had obtained and worn those shoes. Blagg
earnestly asserted his own innocence to the last. Some
persons have been saved, after sentence, as by a hair's
breath, and ultimately shown to be innocent, as in the
cases of Polizzioni, of London ; Ilabron, of Manchester,
1876 ; Alice Rhodes, of Peuge, 1877 ; W. Siddle, of Dur-
ham, 1884, Travis, of Cheshire, 1889, and many more.
During the past year further instructive instances of the
operation of the laws affecting murder have occurred.
■ Thus 8000 signatures to petitions were lately sent
to the Home Secretary praying for the release of
a Lincolnshire man who was convicted of killing
his wife and mother in 1863. He was sentenced
to be hanged, but was transported, and has always
protested his innocence. After 26 years’ imprison-
ment he has been pardoned. This year, also, in the Pun-
iaub, six men were convicted of murder, but shortly
afterwards the supposed victim was found to be still alive.
In April, 1890, a man in New York State was pardoned
after 16 years’ imprisonment for a murder in Burke
county, which another man recently confessed on his
death-bed to have committed. One of the men hanged
this year, in London, on circumstantial evidence, strongly
protested his innocence to the last, and there is a possi-
bility that his plea was justified. A Spaniard who has
been imprisoned since 1887, in France, on a charge of
murder, has lately been found innocent and liberated.
Such cases, with many others, together with the diffi-
culties connected with'hereditary madness, often lead to
very embarrassing interferences with the execution of the
law interferences which never occur, on a similar scale,
except in the case of the death sentence. Thus, during
the year, 135 petitions, with 7500 signatures, were sent to
the Home Office, urging a commutation of the sentence
for a murder at Kentish Town (on the ground of insanity).
In other recent instances, there have been similar
numerous memorials. But law ought to be of such a
nature as to be enforced with the hearty support ®f the
community, and especially so in relation to the repression
of murder, _
The recent Buttner case at Sydney, in which the
convict—sentenced to death for rape—was released
from prison and awarded a State gratuity on the
very day fixed for his execution, through a dis-
covery accidentally made, affords a startling in
stance of the fallibility of human tribunals. The
perjury of the prosecutrix in Luttner was
established by her own confession. Her virtue and
Buttner’s brutality seemed incontrovertibly proved
by the evidence of many (including medical)
witnesses; yet the Government at the very last
moment obtained absolute proof, apart altogether
from her own admissions, that she had for years
been a woman of the town.
[?]
816 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Dec. 2,1891.
Aly Dear Moorabinda,—
Recent arrivals from “ Home ” say that Lady Jersey’s
cacaethes loquendi is quite a sudden attack, and are fairly
surprised at her gift of the gab and lightning talkee-
talkee. And, in support of their astonishment, an
English society weekly (which surely cannot have heard
of her ladyship’s fierce speeches in the last British political
campaign) gushes that her Broken Hill speech “proves
her title to rank as a charming speaker,” and hints that
“this gift of her ladyship’s must not be overlooked by her
friends when she returns to England,” &c. By the way,
every additional speech shows how much “ colonial ex-
perience ” Lady J. has picked up. You never now hear
her hoping “ that the public school children will always
look clean as she did on her maiden stump at Albury.
I begin to disbelieve all those dreary English novels
which follow the sorrows of the governess to the bitter
end—to discredit that damp and tearful range of litera-
ture which depicts the fragile orphan of the deceased
country curate being subjected to the sneers and jibes of
her heartless employers and pupils. Now, judging from
Australian vice-regal samples, titled peoples’ governesses
walk on velvet. They are treated quite like “daughters,’’
and when they get married their cold and cruel employers
give them valuable presents and a handsome breakfast>
and their arrogant pupils shed real tears, and the air is
thickened with compliments. And, on the other hand, if
they don’t marry, they are glad to stay with the family ;
they help to entertain all guests, and they personally
back up their employer-friend in every festivity' in which
she has a hand. The English governess (of fiction) is a
trampled-upon, badgered consumptive, who ultimately
gives up the ghost on a damp doorstep; the English
governess of Australian experience has ten ball-gowns in
the season and her breakfast in bed if she wants it. And >
apropos of teacheresses, it is remarked that since Lady
Carington went away the craze for dragging the instruc-
trice of your hopefuls with you to “ ball, rout, and round-
about” has died away, and Mrs. de Potts Point now
dispenses with the lady in her retinue.
Are women becoming more business-like? or, is it that
the toil-worn first cause of the matrimonial manage has
tired of handing his wages over to a frivolous pansy-
blossom to dissipate as she pleases, and now demands
account of how the money goes? Why I ask is, that I
was buying a reel of cotton or something in a rag-shop
the other day, and had paid my money and was going
away, when the beautiful young man behind the millinery
buffet asked me if I wouldn't wait for the bill? “There
isn’t any change, so why should 1?” was ray bewildered
query', and he made answer : “ Most ladies take their bills
home with them, madam, to see what they spend in the
y-ear.” Which wilted me, of course, but I plucked up
courage to ask if more married than single ladies kept
their purchase-tags (in the hope that the husbands were
mainly responsible for this feminine carefulness, after all),
but I could get no comfort from him. “ They nearly all
do, madam,” he replied sternly, and I retired covered with
confusion, but pleased to hear that somebody was try ing
to live within her income, anyhow. Women can’t be so
reckless with the cash as they are supposed to be if they
treasure up all their reproachful “ Dr.’s to ” for a whole
year.
But you can be too precise over adding up your expen-
diture. There is a Sydney housewife who puts down
every penny she pays out—not when she gets home, but
right on the bargain-spot. This thrifty habit is observ-
able in its full beauty when she is standing afternoon-tea
to a crony in one of the ladies’ cafcis. When the waitress
hands the tag, this careful stewardess remarks in a hollow
whisper, “One-and-six !” fumbles in her hand-bag for her
ivorine tablets, and jots down the mad extravagance
before settling at the counter. Meanwhile, the crony
feels as if she had eaten her entertainer out of pock :t.
After all there cannot be very much significance in a
name, or even in two names. An old lady died in Sydney
the other day at the full-fledged age of seventy odd, who
married a man named Verge w'hen her own name was
Graves. Graves-Verge ! And yet she lived nearly three
quarters of a century'.
One of the heiresses in a Jarndyce versus Jarndyce-like
suit perennially on the list at one of the Supreme Courtg
got married the other day to a fortunate young lawyer’s
clerk with whom she had only been acquainted for
two weeks. Somebody took her to task for her precipi-
tancy and was greatly astonished when the bride made
answer : “ Oh, yes ; I only knew Reginald a fortnight-
hut then, you see, I was a great friend of a girl who had
known him for ever so long ! ” Now, isn’t that an original
lettre de recommendation for a husband ? As a rule, the
girl who has been chummy with Reginald in his salad
days, religiously and deliberately gives him away, lock,
stock, and barrel, if she can get within ear-shot of his final
fiancee.
The Polo match on the N.S.W. Agricultural Society’s
ground, on 24th ult., was watched by a few' society folks
—some of the girls going on horseback, and looking so
trim that I couldn’t help marvelling why it is they don’t
figure in the Centennial Park, and make that ideal
cantering-ground blossom like a rose instead of being
given to the rangers and an eternal horseman on an
oyster-dappled grey charger. The Park is the only pro-
perly-turfed riding track in Australia, and if people
would only follow the Caringtonian foot-prints a very
pretty equestrian spectacle might be presented to admir-
ing visitors. Why they don’t make a local Rotten Row
of "the turfed, safe Centennial track is quite their own
secret. Perhaps they are waiting for Lady Jersey to
announce her intention of driving there one day in the
week!
The oddest thing observable on board the convict hulk,
Success, is that all the gruesome, convict-frocked wax
figures have blue eyes. Whether it is that their living
prototypes really had cerulean orbs, or that the wax
modeller only had blue beads in stock at the time of con-
struction, I cannot say; the fact, however, is somewhat
severe on the sapphire-sighted community. I found the
old, teak-wood relic very interesting on the day I shud-
dered through her, although sassiety doesn’t seem to find
it so. Sassiety stops away from the Success with the
unanimity of one person. On my day a number of weird
people had evidently come to appreciate the sufferings of
personal friends, and one old lady with a hair-net, crino-
line, and demoralised umbrella floated from cell to cell
like a bee from flower to flower, and acted as showman
without a catalogue to whomever fell in her snare. Her
speciality was a thorough knowledge of the way to put on
leg-irons, handcuffs, and refractory collars, and she had
male sight-seers pinioned all over the place by her fair
hands in various implements of torture —“to let ’em fee
just wot ’em pore biys had to suffer.”
It is a sad and painful fact that a large and bony
skeleton is about to overshadow the household of Mrs.
James White—widow of the Hon. James White. The
skeleton is all that remains of Chester, and Mrs. White
is having it mounted in order that the gallant horse’s
memory will be kept green. This is better than selling
favourites off as cabhorses in their sere and yellow leaf.
Viewing 11. M. Stanley perched high and dry in Sydney
Centenary Hall (with his lectern placed so as to hide his
speaking visage from the middle portion of the floor
audience) clothed in spotless linen and a shiny face, as if
he had just soaped it violently, one can’t repress a feeling
of sympathy for the ex-pirate. Although he wasn’t the
good little tin god to the savages that he pretends to have
been, still he has admittedly been accustomed to bound
through the wilderness in search of ivory (and Living-
stone) dressed principally in a '450 navy revolver and a
puggaree, and it was as sad to see him chained down to a
little red covered table with a decanter of water upon it
as it is to gaze upon the caged jackal at the Zoo. At bis
Sydney debut the house was mostly “ sassiety,” so far as
I could see, but the high pews and balustrades
shut out the view of one’s fellow-woman in the
re-christened York-street Wesleyan chapel, and I
just made out that a handful of men and women wore
evening-dress and improved the landscape, but the
majority did not. And here I must rise to enquire why
when a society woman sees fit to come forth after sunset
in walking costume, her lord and master, who accom-
panies her, still reveals the whole of his well-starched
shirt-front? Amongst those who came with bonnets on
were Lady'lnnes (with Sir George Innes and Mr. Innes)
in a dark walking-dress and flashes of jet in a little
capote ; Lady Salomons in a rich-looking visite and a
pink poppy in her bonnet ; the Misses Halliday in winter
jackets and hats ; Miss Salomons in a gingham frock ; and
doubtless many more only I didn’t see them. I ne v °r
turn my head in church.
Yours affectionately,

Premier Dibbs “has not been promised a
dissolution.” No honest Governor ever promises
a dissolution. He simply acts according to cir-
cumstances as they arise.
From the trouble taken to prove that
N.S.W. Libor candidate M’Donnell has neve r
been a policeman it is pretty evident that the
“ foorce ” is now at a discount.
The only man with any sense of decency
connected with the Northumberland Banking
Company seems to have been the auditor, who
was modest enough to commit suicide.
It is understood that the N.S.W. Labor-
party “ will endeavour to keep Dibbs & Co. in
office until June, when the Electoral Reform Bill,
if passed, will have practically come into opera-
tion.”
Last February the Fairfaxes had con-
trolled the S. M. Herald for half-a-century and
in that month also the Herald became 60 years

whenever we read it, it seems to us to be about
89.
Another athlete’s opinion. Australian
Athletic Club, May 3, 1891. Marshall Bros.
Gentlemen —I can honestly testify to the tonic
and strengthening effects of “ Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine.” I consider it the best tonie in Austra-
lia for strengthening the muscles and nerves, and
strongly recommend its benefits to all athletes.
Yours truly, Professor Lawrie, Gymnastic In-
structor.
The late Guerry de Lauret, of Goulburn,
N.S.W., rarely if ever could be induced to speak
his native language, De Lauret was one of the
gentlemen-in-waiting to Charles X., and was
exiled with that monarch. He was in his own
right a Marquis, though he never aired the title in
Australia, and belonged to a family which ranked
high in Brittany. His cousin, Abbe Dugueny,
was shot by the Communists in Paris after the
war 0f.’70.
A verbatim report of the arguments in the
bigamy appeal case of M‘Leod before the Privy
Council has just been received in Sydney. When
published it won’t please Mr. Justice Windeyer,
as the trend of the arguments all through was to
justify the position of those who, like The Bul-
letin, considered that no interpreta’ion of a local
Act could give a local Court power to deal with an
alleged criminal for an offence alleged to have
been committed in a foreign country. One
ingenious illustration of the law in this matter is a
reference to the appeal case as to the liability of
“ colonists ” to the operation of the Income Tax
Act. In the Divisional Court the Judges differed,
one holding that the Act did not authorise the ex-
actionof thetax in England on income, derived from
property held in victoria ; the other holding that
the words of the Act were of sufficient grasp for
the purpose. Upon appeal, the' income was held
exempt, and a portion of one of the judgments
was quoted in the argument in M‘Leod’s case as
material to the point involved. That judgment
refers to the argument of “International Comity,”
and suggests that when the words of a statute are
wide enough to include persons or subject matter,
also taxable in the jurisdiction of another power
or people, it will not beffield that the Parliament
of England contemplated anything so subversive
of “comity.” We should now like to hear Sir
Alfred Stephen’s opinion on the judgment.
When they released McLeod, they censured Sir
Alfred Stephen for hanging Black Peter and, at
least, one other man.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themsqlves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, op other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Elizabeth-straat I( mear King-street, is just
the place; it is certhihty the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

H. M. Stanley, the dreary man from the
Congo, commenced a brief season at the Centen-
ary Hall, Sydney, last Monday, with a profound
and solemn lecture on the mystery of Darkest
Africa. The one fact which sticks out conspicu-
ously at the Centenary Hall is that H. M.
Stanley is not a humorist. Great, gaunt, barren
ribs of solid fact protrude everywhere out of the
shifting waste of his entertainment. Bare, brown
knobs of information rise in dismal grandeur from
the dead-level of the show', and inaccessible pin-
nacles of hard erudition overshadow it in every
direction. The orator is a man of petrified stat-
istics, and each separate item of knowledge is
presented in a way that seems to suggest that he
overtook it after a hard run, and killed it with a
club, and kept the remains for future use. He is
nothing if not profoundly accurate. When one of
his comrades dies in the great, lonesome wilder-
ness, he utterly ruins the pathos of the scene by
flying off the handle to state that the place was
TUS feet—or thereabouts —above the level of the
sea. When he reached Uganda, and made a
triumphal entry into that joyous capital, he
states, with hideous precision, the whole list of
the presents that were fired at him by the reign-
ing monarch, right down to 111 ears of green
corn —one of them short-weight. Stanley signed
the way-bill for that last ear, we should imagine,
under protest. He is dreadfully particular about
the corn and the other items, and if he was in the
midst of a thrilling story an hour later, and sud-
denly remembered that he was oneear out, hewould
go right back and correct the discrepancy. At
one time he seems as if he is about to give a
glittering account of a native war on the shores of
the great lakes, but he forgets about the battle,
and tells the exact length, breadth, and
depth of the big, royal war-canoe instead. If
he is present at the great battle of Armageddon he
will lose the whole show, for he will be away in the
rear somewhere, calculating by geometry the exact
cubic contents of the ammunition, and will miss
the struggle altogether. There are hundreds of
awful bangs and shrieks and slams in his narra-
tive, which .are understood to be the names of
native tribes; and he drags his hearers up huge
mountains as they escape out of some place that
sounds like a bull-voiced demon pounding on a
tank, and rushes them down theother sideinto some
other place that sounds like a steam rooster crow-
ing in old Greek roots. Then with a cold, wooden
expression he tells you the exact latitude of these
places, and their height above the sea, and the
principal vegetables that grow there, and passes
on with the grim solemnity of an iron catalogue
talking by piece-work. His pathetic spots are
disfigured by horrible whizzing noises which are
supposed to be geographical designations, and
when he comes across a tearful tragedy he dries
it, and stuffs it, and puts a ticket on it, and hangs
it up in front of the audience like a ham, with the
inscription, “Pickled Tragedy, 2s. fid.”

Nevertheless, the explorer has his good
points. His hair is beautiful, for one thing.
He is probably sincere, and the pious references
which would sound so much like snuffle in other
lecturers are delivered in all good faith. Having
been a small god for many years in the wilderness
he lives on a moral pedestal, and even if he
regards the Deity only as the senior partner in
the firm there is no visible touch of cant in the
situation. He has evidently revisedhis lecture care-
fully, and remorselessly knocked out the big “I”
wherever it threatened to become too prominent.
And once or twice, in describing his fearsome
voyaere down the Congo, he nearly became inter-
esting. But he dodged the danger successfully
after all, and when he was finished the flight
down the great, dark river was as dry and emo-
tionless and deadly commonplace as a journey
up the Yarra. If Stanley had been an eye-
witness of the storming of Constantinople he
would have described it in his lecture as a dis-
agreement between the Greeks and Moslems in
latitude 30 deg. oast, longitude 40 deg. north, in the
course of which the Turks climbed over a wall 50
feet high and destroyed much property ; no insur-
ance. If this particular explorer means to do any
good business with his lecture ho will get Rider
i laggard to re-write it for him. If Rider Haggard
D too busy, or his terms are too exorbitant, w r e
will refix the oration ourselves at a reasonable
rate on the receipt of Smythe’s cheque. Then,
when the lecture is refixed, Stanley should hire an
elocutionist to deliver it for him, and simply
stand by during the operation as an evidence of
good faith. He is too hard and callous of voice,
and too gritty of delivery to make a success of the
job in person, and if he was as unsympathetic,
to his rear-guard as he is to his audienee it is no
wonder that unhappy institution went wrong.
We fled for home after the lecture, with the
speaker’s dismal"“tnonotone still in our ears, and
took Stanley with us into the land of dreams.
And then all through the night we were following
a big sheet iron explorer w’ho puffed along by
steam through dank forests, where baleful green
eyes glared among the trees, and up huge moun-
tains and down the other side, and over swamps
where the water got into the explorer and put his
fire out, so that we had to hunt for dry wood and
re-kindle him ; and then at last we found a wooden
Livingstone sitting on a ton of ivory and preach-

ing to a crocodile, who said that he was the source

“ Pickpocket ” has never been better
played than now at Sydney Criterion —in fact,
nothing but a theatrical drought prevents
the auditorium from being overflowed nightly.
Andrew, the rheumatic, bilious, shiny-clothed
waiter with the bulgy boots and the rusty
cough, is one of Dot Boucioault’s best parts.
Arthur Lawrence succeeds Harwood and Anson
a s Gregory Grumbledon, the robust valetudi-
narian, and runs him chiefly on the lines of the
former. On the whole, his performance is not a
great with that of either.
Titheradge, as Osmond Hewett, is, of course,
O.K. Mr. Lyndal’s too loving husband, Frederick
Hope, is over-fussy in the first act, but otherwise
all right in a thankless part. Clitherow is ex-
tremely funny as the wild lunatic, and G. L.
Gordon’s Dr. Shaw (a Shakesperian name, by the
way) is quietly effective. Other previous per-
formances, including Miss Romer’s Miss Trumper,
and Pattie Browne’s Freda, are up to old-time
excellence. Miss Spong’s little wife is about her
best effort. On Saturday next the Juvenile Comic
Opera Company open in “ Mikado.”

The Government having decided that
Sells Bros*; horses shall remain in quarantine until
time’s up, and then be shipped back to America,
one of the brothers is now drilling an assortment
of local nags to fill the vacancy, and hopes soon to
have the hippodrome in all its glory once more.
“ The elements have conspired against” Sells so
far that Friday’s gale compelled them to stow the
canvas of the big tent and discontinue their per-
formances, but biz. is splendid, and the season has
been extended till December 9. Visiting the show
again, the Jorella Bros, on the trapeze and Mine.
Costello on the serial rings, recommended them-
selves to us as folks worth watching. Outside the
side-show is well worth a shilling; there may be
seen headless, legless, bustless, armless, trunkless
women, all young and beautiful, and sleight of
hand tricks by the lecturer, who is decidedly
amusing. Last week we inadvertently rechristened
the courteous Colonel —whose hind name is Seeley
—as “ Sellars.”

“Evangeline” is doing good gallery and
stalls’ business at Sydney Royal, and so far seems
to be received with infinitely more favour than
was “The Corsair,” by audiences who were never
disposed to swallow Fortescue in the lump unless
the “Man in the Moon” were added as leaven.
Two surprises were thrown in the other
evening. At the close of the first act a young
lady dropped a usually - accounted indispen-
sable portion of feminine apparel, and got so
paralysed by shame that she didn’t know enough
to kick it out of the way, and stood blushing
while the audience sniggered. Then George
Walton, who comes off tour to take the place of
Johnny Gourlay gone on tour, and who plays Le
Blanc more quietly, but on similar lines, after
hauling for some minutes on the hawser, to
whose extremity is usually appended a small dog,
lost his time for the packthread end came on
without the puppy. The singing of Messrs.
Edwards, Fitzgerald, Brown and tire, is still a
big feature of the show, and the Amazonian
march always snatches in the baldheads.
** * *
“Jo” is not so well played at Sydney
Garrick as we’ve previously seen it. Some good
people are unsuitably placed, and some indifferent
performers are placed over well. G. P. Carey
usually does everything so well that it affords“us
much gratification now to assert that his In-
spector Bucket, vice Burnett retired, wholly lacks
the official tone and air that pervaded it formerly.
Adelaide Cushman, late with Dan Barry, has
joined the Garrick to play Guster, and Frank
Hawthorne, formerly of a travelling company, is
misfitted as Chadband. Jennie Lee, as of old, is
the whole show and nothing but the show ; never-
theless, her voice seems too well greased with
good living to hold throughout its former raucous
huskiness, but her Jo is indisputably one of the
finest pieces of character acting known to the
English stage. Business is not over good. H. M.
Stanley and the other wild-beast show are doing
most of the houses such a heap of harm that things
theatrical are very much unsettled.

Busincss at Her Majesty’s is, on the whole,
more consistently good than at most Sydney
places of amusement, proving the truth of the
adage that when “ Youth’s” at the prow, pleasure
must take the helm. Therefore, no change of
bill is imminent.

This (Thursday) afternoon, Alfred Wyburd
makes a large splash in the placid fish-tanks of
Bondi Aquarium. On this occasion “the finny
denizens of the deep ” (this phrase is copyright)
will be introduced to the Mayor and aldermen,
Superintendent Bear and other officials of the
fire-brigades, the British cricketers, among many
athletes, and several other wise, distinguished and
common plaice soles. The Theatre Royal orchestra
will perform ; several M.P.’s will speak, and
heaps of amusement will be provided.
** * *
Caterers for public amusement would do
well to follow the example of Manager Larmour,
whose engagement of the Misses Albu and the
Elite Quartette drew such an audience to Coogee
Aquarium last Sunday that the hall could scarcely
contain them. As a draw, half-a-dozen first-class
performers are worth a host of duffers. The Misses
Albu will be benefited at Coogee on Saturday
next, when all the local talent available will assist ;
and will appear again next Sunday.

George Darrell has respectfully submitted
“ Hue and Cry ” to the critics and playgoers at
Melbourne Opera House, but the world is wagging
on as usual. The hue of George’s latest work is
a pale, monotonous drab, and its cry never rises
to the importance of a howl, or the dignity of a
piercing shriek. In this instance, too, the pre-
siding genius, spreading himself over long lapses
of years, slowly mellows into middle age under
the disguise of a weird, inhuman dialect, and a
profusion of crimson hair. Were it not for his
dear familiar legs, trusty boots, and unalterable
tones from the far distance, one would have a
difficulty in swearing to George’s identity, especi-
ally at those times when he drops into a waist-
coat by mistake. Surrounded by a wild Irish
wife and a couple of full-grown “ childer ” (who
cling to t’ould fayther, notwithstanding all that
the wigmaker has done for him), he is indeed a
gruesome change from the limelight Adonis of
the old blood-and-thunder days. Unfortunately,
George’s laudable endeavours in the direction of
novelty begin and end with his get-up. He
is a miner as of yore, until he strikes it
rich, and retires into private life as a com-
monplace scarecrow with a warm ’art. A villain
in a silk hat still pursues him, whilst the
well-remembered new-ehum, a comic Chow, an
elderly “ baronet of the realm,” and other stock
Darrell i an accessories pop up much the same as
usual. After opening with a promising murder
the drama degenerates into a weary interchange
of platitudes, relieved by surprises as inevitable
as the water-rate. The one really astonishing
feature about “Hue and Cry” is that George
doesn’t finish up by finding a strawberry-mark on
the left arm of the realmy baronet, and claiming
that perennial idiot for his long-lost brother. In-
stead of which he merely produces the charred
remains of a letter, that have lain hidden in his
pocket for 28 years, whereby the baronet discovers
a niece in one of the alleged childer, whom
George has adopted, in the second scene,
with this end in view. Christine Darrell
takes more than a half share of the
“fat” in her husband’s latest endeavour on
behalf of the family, and is less like human nature
than ever. Her self-consciousness and gush are
positively distressing in one so young and good-
looking. Christine is generally more unreal and
bizarre than a Dresden china shepherdess, both
in manner and appearance. Her dressing in the
hour of adversity, when she wears beautiful light
brown stockings to harmonise with her costume,
is as extravagant as her acting, and she requires
toning down at all points. For the rest, Jenny
Bryce, Lillie Bryer, and Edwin Kelly are very
satisfactory, Greenaway passes muster as the
villain, and young Will Bernard makes some little
headway against his unhappy twang. Charles
Holloway’s twang is past praying for, but he and
one or two others bring experience to bear upon
the subject. Also the staging is satisfactory,
Longstaff’s picture, “Breaking the News,” being
effectively realised in a tableau.

At the Royal there was a spasm of excite-
ment on Saturday night when a frenzied strangel-
- the refreshment contractor in one of hi s
braces, and the victim fell back into a bystander’s
arms under the impression that his end had come-
Nobody fired a cannon at “ Rob Roy,” however>
consequently that exhausted entertainment has
just died a natural death amidst gloomy surround-
ings. On Saturday, by the way, Walter Bentley
assumed the character of Nicol Jarvie (vice Cath-
cart) with dry and uninteresting results. He was
natural enough, but a natural Scotchman is not
necessarily a rich fund of amusement. Bentley
will now be required to fully account for his
presence in “ Hamlet.”

“The Gondoliers ” has kept business brisk
at Melbourne Princess’, but the belief that it
might be made a stronger thing seems to gain
ground, and many people are content to await
future revivals of an opera which would certainly
prove itself grateful for better treatment. In the
meantime, also henceforth and forever, that long
scene between the Duke of Plaza-Toro’s daughter
and her ardent drum-major would stand cutting
an inch or two shorter. The references to “a
quarter of an hour ago ” became irritating at last,
and the performers, suspecting that W. S. Gil-
bert’s humour is off-colour for the nonce, evidently
feel their position keenly. Little Violet Varley
fell ill, or something, the other day—as damsels
will when the music don’t suit them —and Nina
Osborne has been singing in her stead, without
making much difference one way or the other. On
Saturday they revive “Marjorie”—which is a
gorgeous spectacle, anyway for that elastic
period “a limited number of nights.”
* * * *
“Dr, Bill” is finishing strong, as the
touts say, at Melbourne Bijou. Myra Kemble
now puts more dash into her share of the work
than she did some months ago. Her way of
beguiling Cecil Ward to take a cup of tea would
make a good many men swallow the spoon out of
sheer devotion. Further notes of admiration for
the company in general are unnecessary, because
“The Silver Shield” (first time in Melbourne)
goes up for six nights on Saturday.
* * * *
Dampier has taken the exact measure of
his public in “The Great City,” and the ruffians
who roam around Fitzroy and Collingwood, on
the look-out for innocent creatures that require
removal, are nightly hooted by fairly large
audiences. The treasury barometer, indeed, rose
steadily during last week, so it seems likely that
this lurid local narrative will remain popular till
nigh on to pantomime time. Dampier’s prepara-
tions for “Jack the Giant Killer,” in which Aggie
Kelton plays hero, are on a scale of splendour
hitherto unapproached at the “ Hallick,” and he
is advertising for new and shapely legs with wild
prodigality.
* * * *
There is to be a great German night at the
Alexandra, too, on Monday, December 7, when
Madame Wiedermann, Herren Hartung, Schmidt,
Rudolph Himmer, and other well-seasoned ama-
teurs will play “ The Marriage of Figaro,” out of
respect for the memory of Mozart. The same
company gave a really creditable performance of
serio-comic opera, some years ago, in the same
theatre, so it is reasonable to expect that Mozart
will not feel called upon to blush for the honour
heaped upon this anniversary of his decease.

The Gaiety and Vic. still do their best to

Flabby London Figaro, commenting on
the Villiers fiasco with “The Dancing Girl ’ has
the patronising stupidity to “surmise that the
cold reception was due to the players and not to
the play, for the sake of the literary taste of our
Australian cousins.” Why, it was left tor Aus-
tralia to discover that the Duke of Gooseberry is
the sickliest, preachiest illustration of a rotten
hereditary system that ever dazzled the eyes of
the good old British snob. Also, that his lame
duck, whose mission is to put the Duke’s pieces
together and pull him from under the horses’
hoofs, is a nuisance on three sticks. London
critics can’t understand that they are apt to go
into hysterics Over a play which seems to sparkle
amidst the heap of rubbish they are called upon to
sift every month, whilst Australian audiences get
only the “home” successes to choose between, and
are seldom taken in by an article that has little
value outside the cockney market.

We recall three Australian lady Hamlets : Rose Evans,
Miss Cleveland, and Louise Pomeroy.
Osmond Tearle, who is coming, is of Barry Sullivan’s
stamp.
What’s Garner doing ?
George Coppin is trying all he can to deodorize Bentley
of Scotticism, and Walter is nothing loath.
Cathcart, with his memory of supporting Barry
Sullivan, throughout England and America, invites sub-
scriptions for the memorial in Glasnevin Cemetery.
Amory Sullivan has a yarn about being mistaken, in
Bourke-street, for the Slugger, with an assurance that
Slavin “would paste him.”
The seamy-side of circus life has been coming out in the
Melbourne papers, over affidavits about two little Warren
Bros., whose relatives want to destroy their glorious
prospects in connection with Wirth’s Wild West.
A Melbourne paper printed a gruesome portrait—taken
on the premises by a new imaginative process—of Lydia
Manton, in order to give its readers some idea of what
that “ beautiful Gaiety girl ” looked like before she com-
mitted suicide all on account of a prince. The artist
evidently went to Kreitmayer’s Waxworks for an idea of
the fair Lydia. Her wide expanse of chin and round,
aggressive eyes are incompatible with self-destruction,
but the next time a prince slits hiswizand after swallowing
a quart of prussic acid, Lydia will do nicely for a fancy
picture of the damsel who druv him to it.
Mrs. Bernard Beere has positively made up her mind to
go to Australia, and, reversing the order of things, work
back via America. Musgrove will run Mrs. Beere’s Aus-
tralian tour. He will have a good company to support
her. “By the bye,” remarks our London correspondent,
“ won’t you soon have more managers than actors?”
It is reported on bad authority that Stanley is going to
lecture somewhere on the dead niggers who marked the
track of his last expedition, the floggings and hangings,
the females—if any—who were abducted, the alleged
cannibalism of the rear-guard, and the howls and blood-
shed of the British major who was left behind with the
baggage and went raving mad in a swamp. The lecture
will be illustrated with views of the darkey who got 100
lashes, and an African connected with the expedition will
come on at the close of the lecture and state his unbiassed
opinion of Stanley in native dialect. A large attendance
is expected.
Duncan Ross, a correspondent tells us, parted with
Donald Dinnie at Cooktown and went North alone. At
Thursday Island a Rotumah darkey went on the stage
and equalled Duncan in all his lifting feats. Ross then
proceeded to Batavia and opened to a £l2O house. A
local swordsman gave him three prods and received only
two in return, so was declared winner of the 250 guilders
prize hung up by Ross. A wrestler came on the scene,
but Duncan could not put him down, so the Dutch audi-
ence became enraged and rushed the stage. About 300
infuriated Hollanders attacked him with sticks, when he
retreated outside and gave them the slip, leaving them
belting at each other in the darkness.

R. S. Smythe is said to be authority for the statement
that Irving refused £lO,OOO for a four months’ Australian

Those noxious beings, the “ musical critics ” of the

Wiegandand his popular concerts under their whip at last.
The result is seen in the dismal falling off at the Cen-

The N.S.W. official decision that Sells’ horses shall
remain in quarantine for 60 days, unless shipped from
Australia, could not have been more drastic had it been
arrived at by a board of theatrical lessees.
The Hellers and Percy Abbott were performing at
Croydon (Q.) lately to good biz. The original season had

Madame Boeraa sues Madame Simonsen for £6OO,

Laura Villiers, summoned by two of her company for
disputed trifles, appeared in person at the Melbourne
Court, and “conducted her case with great spirit.”
Laura is a lady who would put plenty of spirit into every-
thing but her acting.
Mrs. Langtry denies that she is coming to Australia.
By the way, Mrs. L. is now completely and absolutely out
of society. Langtry won’t divorce her, and won’t give
her a chance to divorce him.
A leg item;—“There is a fascination about a pair of
shapely limbs which never palls. I am not philosopher
enough to explain it, but I am quick to feel its mysterious
power. But this is true of both sexes. Why, look at
Irving. He talks to you with his legs, or rather they
talk to you. They deliberate, hesitate, falter, coax,
threaten,'repulse, lie in wait, rejoice and are sad. Now,
I am willing to admit that a woman cannot do so much
with hers. They are more intractable; they have not
the purely intellectual and coldly analytical power which
a man’s have; but they have a power of their own, an
indefinable grace and charm of poise, which will till the
crack of doom make them one of the great attractions of
the mimic stage.”
A lady who lately visited Gounod says :—“ Sometimes
in the dead of night an inspiration would come to him.
He’d spring out of bed, light the gas, start to work, and
disturb the whole house. His pet whim was to lie abed
in the morning, and play cards with two pretty house-
maids seated at a small table by the bedside. He was
partial to a horrid red shirt, he often forgot to wash, but
his conversation enchanted the listener, and made one
oblivious of his outward self.”
A small headstone on a very much neglected grave, in
the R.C. portion of the old Devonshire-street Cemetery,
bears this inscription—“ Rosalie Durand Lyster, died
8 Dec., 1866, aged 33 years.”
“Mr. Armstrong-Melba’s” record in “Burks’s Bar-
onetage” is as follows—Charles-Nesbitt-Frederick, sixth
and youngest son of Sir Edmund Frederick Armstrong,
hart., of Gullen Priory. Ferbane, King’s County, Ireland,
was born in 1858, and married, in 1882, Helen Porter,
daughter of David Mitchell, and has one son, George-
Prederick, born in 1883.” “Mr. Melba’s” grandfather
sat in the Commons for King’s County from ’4l to ’52.
The present bart. is a C. of E. parson.
Young Fitts, of Melbourne (nont de theatre, Atkinson),
is making a lot of money in London as an entertainer. He
is to be married to the daughter of W. K. Thomson.
According to rumour, Musgrove is buying up no end of
plays, good, bad, and indifferent, in London, for Austra-
lia. I gave you a good tip (says our correspondent) when
I said it would not be long before he was back in Mel-
bourne. He has made a big hole in his cheque. Nellie is
very nice, but she will have to return without startling
the London playgoers.
Christie Murray (writes our correspondent) is working
like a nigger just now, and he has commissions for more
stuff than he can turn out. His earnings last month from
magazine and newspaper contributions alone amounted to
£260, and he will make even more this month. He anti-
cipates a very successful tour in the provinces with
“Ned’s Chum.” When he will start his venture is not yet
settled. The clever lad, Byrne, is meantime rusticating
in Lincolnshire with some relatives.
Farcical comedy (writes our London correspondent)
still holds its own, and there is no sign of waning popu-
larity, especially when the subject is a bit risque. The
latest, and, to my idea, the very funniest, of these farces
was produced last night at the Comedy. It is called
“ Godpapa,” and is the joint work of novel-writing F. C.
Phillips and Brookfield, the actor. Lucky the man who
purchases the colonial rights, for it is sure to boom, even
though you have no “champion Ijar” (on the stage) like
Charlie Hawtrey, or a merry minx like Lottie Venue.
“ Godpapa ” (originally passed the censor without com-
ment, but that functionary somehow began to think that
he had been somewhat lax, and he accordingly recalled
his licence, and the piece had to undergo considerable
howdlerisation. What it must have been in its original garb
I cannot say, but, judging from the tropical nature of the
revised version, it must have been a veritable scorcher.
Henry Arthur Jones, in the preface to his lately-pub-
lished drama, “Saints and Sinners,” says:—“lf it be
objected” (speaking of his descriptions of the modern
middle-class Englishman) “ that they are rather common-
place and uninteresting, I can only urge in defence that
it is impossible to suppose that God Himself can have
taken any great degree of pride in creating four-fifths of
the present inhabitants of the British Isles, and can
hardly be imagined as contemplating His image in the
person of the average British tradesman, without a sus-
picion that the mould was getting a bit out of shape.” In
the ordinary course of things this would be enough to
damn “ Saints and Sinners,” but as the play deals with the
adventures of an aristocratic seducer, J. Bull and his wife
forgive Jones’ blasphemy and rush off to see the fun.
When Melba first appeared in London, Augustus Harris
sat on her. She is now paying him back in his own coin.
Her terms are that she will never sing more than two
nights a week, and those fashionable nights. She insists
on being advertised six clear nights in advance. She is to
select the artists who appear with her. She demands
that the operas be properly rehearsed. She claims the
right to sing at private concerts for herself, and she will
not allow Sir A. Harris to put up cheap prices; and,
finally, she insists that the press shall be invited on every
first night of her performances.
Apropos of Lord Lytton, whose sudden decease last
week is cabled, the story of Victoria Cooke, Empress of
the Arena, will bear telling again. George Titheradge
was the histrionic elocutionist chosen by Lytton to read
the Imperial Proclamation, at the Delhi Durbar, where a
lot of gold medals were handed over to the native princes,
and some remained over, inscribed “Victoria, Empress of
India,” whereupon a bright idea seized Lytton. He took
a medal, scraped out part of the inscription, and changed
it into “ Victoria Empress of the Arena,” after which he
publicly handed over the medal to the girl Cooke, in John
Wilson’s circus ring, Calcutta. Consider the latent
sarcasm here, even on Jingo Lytton’s part, towards his
peerless Empress ! No wonder Yates, in the World— now
cabled to be very ill, by the way—got hold of a big sensa-
tion. Victoria Cooke afterwards visited Sydney and
Melbourne professionally.
Signor Agrati, now here with Sells’ Circus, has paid
altogether six visits to Australia.
Charley Arnold has been playing “ Hans the Boatman”
and “ Carl’s Folly ” in Ireland.
They say an actress nearly burst up the show, in
Sydney, by appearing on the stage when badly in the grip
of influenza. But we don’t believe it; actresses never
take it during business hours.
Myra Kemble just cleared expenses with a little bit
over by her Queensland tour. Charters Towers was the
most prosperous spot she struck ; there, she performed in
a skating-rink and sold standing-room, not seats, and the
spectacle of the entire population filing through the
streets, carrying chairs on their heads, is described as
being suggestive of a general exodus.
The Oharringtons and the faithful Fleming sailed for
India in the Arawatta.
J. Hamilton Magee, of Sydney Criterion, has come into
a small fortune by the death of his sister in Ireland. He
goes homeward to inherit, but returns to harness as soon
as possible.
Larry Foley wishes the public to understand that
Charles Armstrong, his pupil, never put him through a 1
anything, despite the latter’s familiarity with the small-
sword, a weapon with which Larry is comparatively
unacquainted. Nor did he (Foley) offer his hall and
“services” to “Toby” Barton ;it w r as hired from him in
the ordinary course of business. Anyone who wants to
fight Larry with singlesticks is invited to come along.
Stanley mourning over his lost boat in the Congo :
“We hoisted it up on the rocks and left its bones to
bleach for she had nobly fulfilled her mission.” That was
where he came in, we presume.
This is a sample of the sort of alleged African legend
that Stanley fires into his audience : —“There was a lion
once that lived up in the forest. He was a very large and
strong animal, and he always went about saying ‘ I am the
strongest animal on earth.’ He used to walk up and down
challenging the other animals, but none of them would
ever fight him. But at last one day a rabbit, which had
got tired of the lion’s incessant boasting, came to him
and said: ‘Oh, Mr. Lion, I hear you are the strongest
animal on earth.’ ‘Yes, Mr. Rabbit,’ said the lion.
‘ Well,’ said the rabbit, ‘ I met a very strong animal out
in the woods to-day and he says he wants to meet you.’
‘ Well, Mr. Rabbit,’ said the lion, ‘ bring him along—
I’m his man.’ Then the rabbit took the lion to a
place in the woods where he and all the other rabbits
had enclosed a circle with very strong palisades,
and he said to the lion, ‘Go right in there—you will
find him waiting for you.’ When the lion went in he
closed the door and left him there. Then he called to
him, ‘ Oh, Mr. Lion, are you quite ready to meet that
champion,’ and the lion said,,‘ Yes, yes, hurry up. Bring
along the champion ’ Then the rabbit went away for 24
hours, and when he came back he called through the cage
again, ‘Oh, Mr. Lion, are you quite ready?’ And the
lion said, ‘Yes, of course, I am. Bring the champion
along and I’ll meet him.’ And the rabbit said, ‘ Just
wait a minute, and I’ll fetch him ; he’s coming.’ Then
the rabbit went away again for 24 hours. Next day he
came back, and by this time the lion was getting very-
hungry, and he said, ‘ Mr. Lion, are you ready to meet
that champion?’ And the lion said, ‘Yes, yes, I’m
getting tired of waiting. Bring him along.’ And
the rabbit went away for 24 hours more. And when
he came back the lion was so exhausted from hunger that
he could hardly lift a paw from the ground. And rhe
rabbit said ‘Are you there, Mr. Lion? Are you quite
ready?’ And a faint voice from inside said ‘Oh, yes;
make haste and bring along that champion, or I shall die
of famine.’ But the rabbit went away for 24 hours more,
and when he came back there was no voice inside, for the
lion was dead. And the rabbit said to himself: ‘ Ah, the
lion has found someone strong enough to meet him at
last. And the of that champion is Hunger.’ ” This
is a much-abbreviated copy of the anecdote, for the
original yarn took about ten minutes in delivery. The
moral probably is that a lion needs his victuals regularly,
and as a sort of subsidiary moral it is probably intended
to show that you shouldn’t chaff a starving lion in a cage.
Anyhow, it was the saddest, flabbiest anecdote we ever
heard, and when it was told slowly and monotonously the
effect was suicidal.
This is another of Stanley’s unduly exciting anecdotes :
“ When I was in U-gan-da an in-tell-i-gent lit-tle black
boy. a pa-age to the king, asked me, ‘ Why is it that all
the white men have long nos-es and all the white men’s
dogs have short nos-es, while all the black men have
short nos-es and all the black men’s dogs have long
nos-es?’ 1 needn't tell you the answer.” Then we held
ourselves down with both hands, else we would have
yelled out in despair: “ What was the answer?” Did
Stanley tell the small nigger that he didn’t know ? Did
he say that the dog’s nose was the act of God? Or did he
simply order the half-grown heathen to shut up ? Did he
stand drinks for the black infant, or tell him to “ ask me
something easy?” or did he give him a Bible and say in
hollow tones, “This is the secret of England’s Great-
ness! ” Evidently there is some answer to the conundrum
that is so stupid, so dull and blank and leaden and
ineffably dreary, that Stanley took it for granted it must
occur to everybody. But it didn’t occur to us all the
same, and we object to half-finished anecdotes.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Now that Bray leaves to take the Agent-
Generalship, Coalition is the only thing to save
the Playford, (S.A.) Ministry.
Parkes has for the third time “ shut the
dour of his political life for ever,” and, as usual,
has bolted it firmly—with “ a boiled carrot.”
The reasons adduced in the N. S. Wales
Assembly for not enfranchising soldiers, apply
witli equal force to every other branch of the civil
service.
Jawbone Neild declares that the Orange-
men of N.S.W. control 25,000 votes and in-
directly influence 100,000. This is all very pretty
on paper.
Bechcr, erst of Grafton (N.S.W.) Grip,
now of Charlton (Vic.) Independent, is candidate
for the representation of Korong in coming Vic-
torian election.
It is pretty certain that the Protectionist
N.S.W. Ministry will beat the Foreign-trade
Opposition on the division after the ensuing
Budget debate.
Dr. Cockburn has been a member of the
S.A. Legislature for seven years, and in all that
time he lias only been absent for one sitting.
What a horrid grind !
Parkes is going down to Kiama ! He is
billed to lecture on Federation, but his motive,
doubtless, is to belittle Toby Barton for fathering
the “ holy cause” just a little too bumptiously.
Sir Alfred Stephen disputes the right of
wage-earners to exclusively style themselves “ the
people.” The State pensioner is as much one of
“ the people” as the hangman or the grave-digger.
The other day a N.S.W. Labour-member
got a letter from a racing club in his constituency
calling on him for a guinea subscription. Ap-
pended was this postscript: “Another general
election seems imminent— verb, sap.”
It is said that Premier Dibbs is agreeable
to summon R. A. Brice, as a Labour representa-
tive, to the Legislative Council. Is R.A.P. wait-
ing to see if H. H. Brown loses his seat for
Durham before he shows his hand ?
R. Caldwell M.P. (S.A.) has introduced a
Bill providing for the limitation of interest. The
maximum rate is fixed at 10 per cent. Under the
Bill agreements containing higher interest can-
not be registered and will not bind.
Amongst the members of the N.S.W.
democratic party, an earnest determination is
expressed to cut down the enormous military
estimates. Competent instructors and officers
could be got from Germany for half the money.
Premier Dibbs undertakes to block General
Booth’s army of paupers in red if they attempt to
infest N.S. Wales, and will urge the other Aus-
tralian Governments to do likewise. There is
trouble ahead for the prophet with the three-ball
c mntenance.
Sydney D T. to the aid of the Labor-party
in N.S.W. Parliament ! It applauds the organ-
ised onslaught on the Military Estimates, but it
cajoles the democratic members not to touch the
fiscal question this session. Freetraders in a
frenzy !
The S.A. Railways have returned a profit
for last year of 5.32 per cent. Revenue >£1,223,999,
expenditure £l6l7,l79—profit, .£606,820. The
British railways only pay 3*99 per cent., and yet,
comparing these figures, people howl that railways
in Government hands never pay !
Tom Garrett resigned from the three
Administrations of which he was a member.
Parkes, his last chief, was not present at his
funeral. By the way, Garrett is said to be
the only noteworthy politician in N.S.W. from
whom Parkes could not extract a loan.
J. P. Garvan, M.P., in N.S.W. Assem-
bly : “ So surely as we give the military a vote, in
the first election the leader of the military forces
will become a partisan, and at the head of Ins ICO
or 1000 men, with banners flying and drums beat-
ing, he will march to the polling-booth.” Vote
given !
Will Chief Justice Darley shirk his judicial
duties when he assumes the office of Lieutenant-
Governor of N.S.W.—or will he do double duty
and draw double screw ? One man one billet, even
though the man be a Chief Justice. What a satire
to entrust the prerogative of mercy to a Tory Chief
Justice!
Ex-Treasurer M‘Millan says that the new
N.S.W. Freetrade Association “has nothing to
do with economy; ” its only business is to look
after Freetrade. If M'Millan speaks for himself
he is about right. He never had anything to do
with economy. The shortage lie left behind him
proves that.
“ The S. M. Herald —one of the most
politically unprincipled papers in the British
empire, and the most opposed to popular freedom
and the rights of men, although conducted by
three professedly Christian men, a High Church
Puseyite, a Deacon of the Independents, and an
ex-Methodist preacher.”— Dr. J. D. Lang.
What do the St. Leonards electors think
of Parkes skulking off to Nowra, a small village
to screech at the “ Political Situation” in N.S.W.?
Hie applause of Millionaire Hay’s docile tenantry
will lie blazoned forth in the London press as
public opinion on the fiscal issue. Parkes evi-
dently intends to gird at the “creature ” Protec-
tion again.
J. P. Garvan, M.P., is claimed by Sydney
Echo as_ “the ablest and most acute financial
untie ” in N.S.W. Parliament—when it wants
the politician to be “ a friendly critic ” of the Pro-
tectionist Ministry, “especially of the adminis-
tration of the finances.” On other occasions when
the I reetrade Echo has an axe to grind for the
Gerald, Garvan is pilloried in its columns as
Dismal Jimmy.” Garvan has shipwrecked four
Ministries in his time.
During Parnell's brief career, wages in
Ireland rose, on an average, 40 per cent, all round.
He brought the rents down, and the money that
was saved from the landlord went direct to the
labourer. Truly there is a tremendous power in
holy snuffle, when under its influence a whole
nation would round on the leader who had been a
benefactor to 4,000,000 human beings, merely
because lie had been rather less than a benefactor
to one woman.
The just-deceased Lytton had done naught
particular, when Disraeli plunged on him as
Indian Viceroy, just as on Bookseller Smith, for
Naval Lord. Although the Afghan War cost 30
millions, Lytton may be excused, for, of course,
India is governed by telegraph nowadays. Then
A FASHIONABLE EPIDEMIC.
DUNNEM: “When will you be able to settle that little account, sir ?”
MR. SPECELING : “Well, to tell you the truth, I’ve had the influenza so bad that I’ve not
been able to sign any cheques, but I’ll be all right soon.’’
he scourged and gagged the native Bangabasis,
a physicking revived this year, because the Banga-
basxs had uttered such a blasphemy as that
England conquered and held India by force, not
love. Dufferin succeeds Lytton at Paris.
Dear Bulletin, —Reading a par. in your
last issue anent the raising of rents in Newcastle
(Eng.), consequent on the passing of a Free Edu-
cation Bill, reminds me that when the coal-
lumpers and wharf-labourers of Sydney obtained
a rise of 3d. an hour by combination, some years
ago, rents at Miller’s Point at once went up from
Is. 6d. to 3s. per house. One sooty son of toil
remonstrated with his landlord, the owner of 40
houses, who replied : “ I’ve raised my rents
because you’ve raised your wages. You can afford
to pay more now.” “Spare my days!” replied
the “coaly,” “you blood-sucker, d’ye mean to say
I’m only workin’ for your benefit?” “ You’ve
said it,” returned Suck-’em-dry.—Yours, Labour
Member.
The evening organ of the “ wealthy lower
orders ” in Sydney affects to believe, that Premier
Dibbs does not bold republican views, as he has
taken the oath of allegiance to the Crown. To
remove the doubts of Imperial Fedcrationists The
Bulletin reproduces a sentence or two from
Dibbs’ speech on Australian Federation I
have an ambition, as a native of this country,
that this country shall become a nation. I believe
I voice the sentiments of every Australian-born
son of the soil when I say that our ambition, our
aspiration, and our hope is to see the flag of the
Southern Cross flying not only over united Aus-
tralia but over Australia united as one nation.
That is the future I aspire to as a loader in this
councry. ” On a previous occasion Dibbs impressed
upon Parkes the prudence of providing a suite of
rooms in the new Houses of Parliament for the
accommodation of the President of the Australian
Republic.
A few weeks ago sonic surprise was aroused
by the frantic somersault of a certain Foreign-
trade paper, which published fourteen bloodthirsty
articles against Edmund, say Smith, and then
issued a fifteenth, calling on the people to vote
for him as ono man and put him in. It now
transpires that the chairman of directors was the
cause of the trouble. At the last moment he sent
down his ukase, “this paper is to go strong for
Smith.” Then there was foaming and cursing in
the editorial department, and the editor could lie
heard dancing wild fandangebs of rage on the
stairs. There were three courses before them—to
resign, to write another frantic Frcctiade article
against Smith and let the chairman do his worst,
or to knock under. They decided to knock under,
and next day the paper sang a different song in
quite a different key.
The C.M.G.’s in N.S.W. Upper House, as
a rule, all roost together. John Davies and
“Bob’’Smith, good attendants, always sit side
by side, and when C. J. Roberts finds t'me to
appear ho, an a rule, sits alongside the other two.
Ned Coombes turns up occasionally and fixes him'
self immediately behind the last named. The ex-
Judges sit together, and until (heir “promotion”
Salomons and Dick O'Connor chipped in with
Pilcher, Q.C. The courtly G. B. Simpson, Q.C.,
has scarcely put in an appearance since he resigned
office. The medical men sit in bunches—Renwick,
M‘Kellar, M'Laurin and Bowker discuss influenza
and other kindred topics; Dr. Creed sits alone at
the table buried in military figures. Sheepbreeders
like Lee, Halliday and “Jack” Smith form a
coterie; the old firm of “ Pigott and Triekett ”
still exists in the Council with an occasional chip
in from “Dr.” Norton. The horsey men, Long,
Dangar and S. A. Smith are inseparable. The
only men who seem to be alone are John Lucas
and Sir Alban J. Riley.
Sample of cast-iron gall from tho alleged
Governor’s speech at the opening of Canadian
Parliament;—
I have also to express my sympathy in the regret which
you and the whole Dominion feel, and which I sincerely
share, for the lamented loss of the late Prime Minister,
Sir John Macdonald, who died full of years and honours
in the midst of your deliberations.
Think of that! The ancient father of swindles
and corruption, the prize liar of all America, the
politician whose life was one long snavel, the man
who took tips, and faked electoral-rolls, and sold
contracts, who allowed his subordinates to charge
their mistresses to the Consolidated Revenue, and
who never allowed a job for whitewashing a
Government fence to pass without getting his per-
centage out of it. Think of these things, and
consider the rhinoceros hide of the British Gover-
nor who could stand up and fire off eulogies over
the dust of “Old To-morrow!”
It is alleged that one suburban Sydney
sweater—a tailor —pays his female employes—he
has six—respectively, 95., Bs. (id., 75., 65., 65., and
4s. per week.
At a recent Maoriland Agricultural Show
the jury-cards bore this inscription: “The coin-,
mittee are instructed to treat the judges to
luncheon, and not more than four drinks each,
free.”
More in sorrow than in anger one refers
to the photo., flaunted in Melbourne, of 27 of
Hopetoun’s man-servants, the gentlemen’s gentle-
men, grouped in front of Parliament House, as an
inexpressibly degrading thing.
J. Astley Cooper (quondam London cor*
respondent to cne of the Adelaide dailies, and
now editor of Great Britain, a journal devoted
to the Imperial Federation fetich) and not his-
torian Fronde, is the real author of what the
cable-man describes as “Fronde’s scheme ” for
bringing England and her colonies into closer
communion. Mr. Fronde's name only comes into
the matter by reason of the fact that Cooper sub-
mitted the scheme to him for his approval. Mr.
Froude admits that the idea of a Federal Parlia-
ment is absurd, and the proposed commercial
union an impossibility. He says that the Ameri-
cans would join heaitily in this ideal Pan-Anglo-
Saxon Festival. Cooper has succeeded in getting
a good ad. for his paper, which, after all, is per-
haps what he wanted.
Dear Bulletin, —Henry Lawson, in his
verses “The Shame of Going Back,” in your issue
of 10th October, calls up to us Southerners the
fate of poor Joe Baxter and the equally lament-
able fates of two others —Charley Roberts and
William Thompson—who followed in his tracks.
Joe was landlord of the Pier Hotel here, and
made a comfortable little pile. Prohibition and
Local Option threatened demolition to the whisky-
trade, and Joe went farther afield. He sold out
and crossed over to plunge on the Melbourne Cup.
He plunged so deeply that he had some trouble
in getting his head above water ; then he started
a lemonade-mill in Bananaland, which brought
him below the Plimsoll-mark, and he returned to
Maoriland—to Auckland—no farther; the shame
of going back stranded him there with a bullet
through his brain. His friend, Charley Roberts,
took it badly to heart and administered to himself
a similar leaden prescription. Then William
Thompson, whilom host of the Criterion Hotel, a
friend of both the deceased, and a trustee in
Roberts’ estate, laid himself out cold with the
latter’s revolver. These are all comparatively
recent happenings, and now we don’t know where
this kind of thing will end.—Yours, &c.,
T.M.W., Dunedin, Maoriland, 10th October 1891.

SUFFERED 30 YEARS, BUT NOW WELL.
Seymour, Victoria, October 14th, 1891. For
thirty years I suffered from Liver, Kidney, and
Gravel Diseases, and it would be impossible to
give even a faint idea of the misery and pain I
endured during that time. I was treated by
several of the leading doctors in Melbourne, but
not one of them could give me any hope of a
recovery. They expected my complaints to
develop into Bright’s Disease. I was serving in
the Mounted Police force, but had to resign on
account of my illness. After taking a few bottles
of safe cure, I passed a quantity of clotted blood,
after which I had ease. I continued taking the
safe cure for twelve months and then felt I u-'dS
quite cured. My wife was afraid the disease
would return, and advised me to continue its use
for a further period in half doses, which I did.
That was about three years ago, and since then I
have not felt anything of the old complaint, and
now am able to eat, drink, sleep and work with
pleasure. I can now appreciate what health and
strength is. My friends never expected to see me
alive to-day, much less in the enjoyment of all my
bodily powers.— J. G. Doxey, Wholesale Produce
Merchant.
bright’s disease cured.
253 Queensberry St., North Melbourne, Victoria,
October, 2lst, 1891. In bearing testimony to the
benefit derived from the use of Warner’s safe cure
and safe pills, I feel myself in duty bound to give
the full details of ray case. I suffered most
acutely for nine months from Bright's Disease of
the Kidneys. I consulted the most eminent
medical men of the day, but I must confess their
attentions and prescriptions did not do me much
good, but rather I felt that the medicines they
gave me only aggravated my disease. A t times I
was in such agony that I despaired of ever being
cured. However, accidentally 1 heard there was a
cure, and that was Warner's safe cure. As a last
resource I tried a bottle, and obtained such relief
that I was encouraged to continue its use. When
1 had taken the twelfth bottle and the fourth of
the safe pills, the dreadful symptoms had vanished.
My urine, which before contained a large per-
centage- of albumen, now regained its normal
color ; and I can confidently say I am better in
health to-day, than I have been for many years, and
this I owe wholly and solely to Warner’s safe cure
and safe pills.

It will take 1,600,000 rifles to arm Russia’s
European army alone. Between the Russian and
French factories, which are hard at work day and
night, this number of weapons of the most
approved pattern will be supplied before the end
of ’92. Armageddon may come then.
The female flea never bites, unless her
young be attacked. How, then, it may be asked,
does she live? Simply by kissing her husband,
and absorbing the blood left on his moustache.
Another version is that the female flea lives by
biting her husband. Arguing from analogy (in
the matrimonial domain) this is very likely
indeed.
James Fenton, in his “Bush Life in Tas-
mania” says, regarding transportation: “Many
good farm servants — better than any that I have
seen since—used to be sent out for seven years for
mere trifles. I knew one excellent fellow who
received that sentence for stealing a turnip that
grew by the roadside, which he ate as he went
along.”
From August 15 to September 15, the
most popular work in London, as tested by book-
sellers’ sales, was Rudyard Kipling’s “Life’s
Handicap.” The agents of the Sydney and Mel-
bourne trade sent out huge supplies, which, how-
ever, don’t move off. The volume contains some
of the author’s finest work, but also a lot of
rubbish.
Some short time ago, in The
H. J. McOooey, the naturalist, laughed at “ RoR
Boldrewood ” for stating in the “Squatter’s Dream’
that there were eels in the Riverine waters.
Then some newspapers laughed at McCooey.
Now, the McCoy (Melbourne Museum) and Dr.
Ramsay (Australian Museum) say that McCooey
is right. There now !
“ It was expected that Mr. H M. Stanley,
the celebrated explorer, would arrive in Sydney
by Saturday morning’s express from Melbourne,
and the executive officers of the Royal Geographi-
cal Society of Australasia were in waiting at the
Redfern Station to welcome him. When the
train arrived it was found that Stanley was not
on board, and the gentlemen who were expecting
him had to return to their homes without fulfilling
their mission.” Motto for the R.G.S. of As.
“How we did not find Stanley.”
Item from the red-painted Booth :
They should always seek to help the sufferers, no
matter who they were. Even if in the Happy Land they
saw a fellow angel fall down and break his leg—if he had
a leg—(laughter)—they should say to another, “ hold my
crown while I help the poor fellow out of his trouble.”—
(Laughter.) Let them never mind their crowns just now,
but help those who were in need of it.
The Bulletin doesn’t want to cast aspersions
upon anybody, but it would strongly recommend
that angel with the broken-leg to feel in both bis
heavenly pockets as soon as he recovered con-
sciousness, and see if his money is all there.
Also, he should have his halo tied oh with a big
rope.
A wild-eyed damsel rushed into Melbourne
Hospital the other night, crying aloud for a deep
draught of antidote and a speedy application of
the stomach pump. It subsequently transpired
that she had been quarrelling with her young
chap on the burning subject of “ the other girl,”
and had slowly absorbed sixpen’orth of opium
with a view to being stopped before she could
accomplish her fell purpose. Unfortunately
Romeo was not equal to the occasion, or perhaps
the ardent swain had his hands in his pockets at
the time. He stood by and meditated,
apparently, whilst the injured pansy was taking
her cup of cold poison and saying “ There, now !”
over the rim, after each sip. And when all the
deadly potion had penetrated into the interior of
Miss Harriet her admirer went on smoking as
usual, so she sprinted off to the Hospital and was
pumped dry, in a dull, methodical manner. The
moral of which story is that a jealous girl
generally hates the other minx worse than
poison.
How shabby and faded these old chairs are

The death of “Tom” Garrett, prince of
parliamentary debaters, was no doubt accelerated
by a recent most unhappy occurrence in his
domestic circle.
Significant is the announcement, in the
Melbourne papers last week, of the first post-
mortem, for the coroner, by a lady doctor, Miss
Constance Stone, M.D.
The greatest hand-shaker in the N.S.

Mr. Toohey, M.L.A., took a trip to Mel"
bourne last week for the purpose of “assisting’
at that peculiar investigation into the affairs of
Larkin and his building society.
The appointment of Chief Justice Darley
as Lieut. -Governor of N.S.W. is somewhat of a
snub to Sir John Hay, who was commissioned to
act should Sir Alfred Stephen be incapacitated.
According to Archbishop Ullathorne, it
was Governor King who gave the kookaburra
(“ laughing jackass ”) its popular name. Now the
fact is that the jackass’ godfather was Governor
Hunter.
Mrs. Mary Sanger Evans, of Sydney,

When Salomons, Q.C., received news of
his knighthood, he immediately tore down his
signboard. There is a blank space, oblong-shaped,
by the door of Denman Chambers, Sydney. This
shows where an advertisement has been scratched
out.
Dr. Bingham Crowther, charged with
criminal practice, bad, perhaps, the best medical
clientele in Hobart. A fine bronze statue was
recently erected in Franklin Square in honour of
his father, an old-time Tasmanian doctor and
legislator.
The real name of Harold Dutton Mallalien,
aged about 20 years, executed last week at Dubbo,
N.S.W., -for murder, is believed to have been
Harold Massey. It is thought that he was a
native of Cheshire, England, and that he came of
a “ good family.”
It was George Brown (“Bruni,” of the
Australasian) who selected Panic for Australia
in 1860. Between Panic’s subsequent owner
(“Bryan C’Lynn” Phillips) and “Bruni” there
existed at one time a bitter feud, the cause of
which would be worth the telling.
The Age’s sympathy with Larkin and airy
way of considering his alleged defalcations, seem
the more remarkable when studied in connection
with the fact that the self-accused embezzler is a
boss Roman Catholic. There is a heap more in
the Larkin case than meets the unenlightened
eye.
Gladstone is said to have been the only
Liberal in the House of Commons who didn’t
know of Parnell’s affaire for years before O’Shea
brought his divorce-suit into Court. The aston-
ishment of everybody else over those‘‘shocking
disclosures,” was as bogus as a ballet-girl’s blush
a mere conspiracy of shams.
Waterhouse, the captured Sydney bank-
defaulter —a parson’s son, by the way—complains
bitterly that during his detention in a London
gaol he had to “herd with common criminals.”
The airs which the big embezzler puts on are a
remembersome thing. What about the men who
had to “ herd ” with Waterhouse ?
Despite Lord Kintore, the town of Inna-
mincka, which he about two years ago changed to
“ Hopetoun ” after his brother “noble” the Vic-
torian Governor, still retains its native name, and
in S.A. Assembly last week members persisted in
calling the polling place after the native word.
“ Innamincka ” it will be to the end of the
chapter.
Kipling must deteriorate, if he keeps out
of his proper atmosphere, like Stevenson and
Haggard. Nathaniel Hawthorne ruined his fame
by leaving the America of the “Twice Told
Tales,” “Scarlet Letter,” and “House of the
Seven Gables.” Inexhaustible India is Kipling’s
field, and out of it he will only become a book-
maker, like Haggard out of South Africa.
When Dr. Ullathorne visited Adelaide,
in 1839, his host was Mr. Phillips, one of the
original members of the South Australian
Association, and a father of W. Gerard Phillips,
of Sydney, the well-known financial - agent.
While there, he baptised the new-born daughter
of his host and hostess, and said : “Now, remem-
ber, this child must be a nun.” Grown-up, the

“Rolf Boldrewood’s” new story, “Never-
more” —part of w'hieh appeared in the defunct
Centennial Magazine— will be published in
January. Of “Robbery under Arms,” 40,000
copies have been published. The sale of his other
books to date has averaged 10,000 to 12,000 copies
each. In his publisher’s catalogue “ Boldre-
wood’s ” name is sandwiched between Aurelius
(Marcus) and Caesar (Julius). There’s fame !
When the effects of old “Bob” Waters,
the retired Bathurst officer of police, were ex-
amined by his executors, a locked tin box was
discovered in his bedroom, which, on being
opened, was found to contain two human skulls,
said to be those of notorious bushrangers. The
question is how “Bob” came by them. Were
they a part of the spoil obtained when Dan. “ dug
up Deniehy ” in the old Milltown cemetery ?
The new London literary journal, The
Bookman, issues with its first number a fine
reproduction of an early portrait of Tennyson.
Though the paper doesn’t state so, the drawing
originally appeared as the frontispiece to that
very remarkable production, The Spirit of the
Age, edited by Richard Hengist Horne, author of
“ Orion.” Horne, on leaving Melbourne for Eng-
land, gave his own copy of the publication to
Judge Pohlman, of the Victorian County Court.
A. H. Boyd, Stipendiary Magistrate of
the Huon district, Tasmania, well-known as one
of the later Port Arthur “Commandants,” was
killed the other day by a fall from his horse. His
death has removed a disgraceful state of things in
regard to the impartial administration of justice
in the district named. To fine a man for being
“drunk and incapable,” and then go home help-
lessly drunk, was but a small item in the vagaries
of this man pitchforked into position by
influential relatives.
The late Thadeus O Kane, of the
Northern Miner, (Q.), didn’t set much store on
racing matter for his paper. One November day
he told his foreman to put in a rather trivial
political paragraph and omit the result of the
Melbourne Cup, for which result a big crowd was
waiting outside the office. However, the chief
comp., who was “ a bit of a sport,” publ shed the
Cup winner and left out Thady’s political par,
and then there was trouble, as anyone who ever
knew Thadeus O’K. will readily imagine.
Bookstall Smith had a bio; funeral. Queen
Victoria sent Ponsonby and Radnor to mourn for
her. Wales sent Suffield to mourn for him. The
Duke of Edinburgh wailed through his agent —
one Colville. Louise despatched a flunkey named
Collins, and Beatrice sent another flunkey named
Biddnlph to grieve officially. Battenberg and
Connaught didn’t send anybody. Not a single
soul of any importance turned up to weep in
person. There was about half-a-mile of empty
cabs and carriages, and that was practically all.
t' A Sydney Sunday paper tells you about'
the daughter and son of Melville, the bushranger,
meeting on board the old hulk “Success” in
Sydney harbour, which would be peculiarly affect-
ing if only true. There are two persons, and two
only, who know the true secret of Melville’s
life-one an official now very high up in the
Victorian Civil Service, who has a narrative of
Melville’s career, penned by the criminal himself,
and “Price Warung,” who has a copy of that
manuscript. Melville was a clergyman’s son, and
an Oxford undergraduate. His story will be told
when his father— still alive—dies.
Some more about Dailey. The house of
Hordern, draper, in which it was proposed to
apprentice young Dailey, is still standing and
still a draper’s. The two houses built by his
father in aristocratic Macquarie-street still stand,
now old-fashioned and ricketty. When Dailey
was called to the Bar his mother, good woman,
was so proud of the fact that she frequented the
drapers’ shops asking for “lavender gloves for my
son, the barrister.” Dailey’s father and mother,
brother and sisters, are in the R.C. Cemetery in
Devonshire-street. His wife is in Billy Long’s
vault, at Randwick, and his own corpse in
Waverley.
Lord Esher, the Master of the Rolls, has
had himself and wife elegantly carved and laid
out upon the marble lid of their silent tomb in
Esher parish churchyard. There they lie in
truthful effigy, flat on their backs, and with their
calm, cold heads resting upon the same hard
bolster, to show that even in death they will not
require a pillow apiece, and fight for the one with
most feathers in it. Every Sunday morning,
Esher and My Lady walk, arm in arm, through
the churchyard to the quaint little house of
prayer, and sometimes they pause by the way to
pick slugs, or dabs of dirt, off their dead selves as
they lie a-dreaming.
The “ Autobiography of Archbishop Ulla-
thorne,” the first R.C. Vicar-General in Australia,
just published, is another illustration of the
danger of a man, even though possessed, as the
Archbishop was, of a remarkable memory and keen
powers of observation, trusting to his recollec-
tion. The book is prodigiously interesting,
viewed from almost any standpoint, but its im-
portance as a contribution to Australian history
is greatly discounted by little inaccuracies of date
and place. Many of the errors could be corrected
by references to earlier publications from the same
pen, but apparently the one book consulted by the
Archbishop was ex-Judge Therry’s “Eeminis-
cences.” Even misprints in the latter volume are
repeated in the Archbishop’s memoirs.

When you go to inspect a mine in com-
pany with a man never allow him to smoke a pipe
while washing prospects. Some gold, you see,
may accidentally fall out of his pipe into the dish.
Honest men who have a habit of turning their

What would have been a gruesome Sydney
divorce-case has just been obviated by the death
oTE the husband. Part of the evidence forthcoming
was that the lord and master, well-known in
“Society,” came home in the d.t.’s, seized a large
carving-knife, and swore to cut the throat of the
new baby on its arrival.
• # •
Jealousy was the all-powerful cause of
nearly all the divorce-eases heard at the recent
Sydney sittings. It is also the cause of most
marriages. We collocate these facts for the benefit
of people desirous of marriage. Jealousy is the
ioker of the matrimonial euchre-pack.

At Croydon, Queensland, lately—writes a
correspondent—a young lady had two lovers and
did not know which to choose. However, she
arranged to go to Normanton. Bill was to follow
by the next train and marry her. She went, but
the arrangement reached the ears of Jack, who
immediately jumped on his horse, rode 100 miles
to Normanton without drawing rein, and heat the
train. He married the girl the same day and
took her back next day. At the station they met
the other fellow, who only then realised that he
had dropped his watermelon.

Lord Sheffield, tooled by Major WardiU,
took a sort of triumphal trot round the ground
after the Vies, had concluded their melancholy
duties at the wickets last Friday. The mob fairly
rose at the “ noble patron of cricket ” and cheered
him as though he wore Billy Elton in a new opera.
A ’orty Family Herald stamp of earl might,
under similar conditions, have been a gloomy
failure, but the cut of the Sheffieldian trousers
established his lordship as a favourite on the spot.
A lord who looks kindly and is fairly in touch
with the multitude on at least one subject is
regarded with the same amount of exaggerated
admiration that falls to the lot of a parson who
behaves like an ordinary Christian. Critically
considered, Lord Sheffield is merely a non-
aggressive representative of deplorable social and
political systems, and better deserves to be wept
and groaned over than to be cheered at. But,
regarded as a simple-minded old fellow who runs
a wholesome show for its own glory, and with an
amiable desire to amuse more people than himself,
Sheffield is not so displeasing to the democratic
eye. His title and undue wealth are faults for
which thousands of bad precedent excuses might
be quoted, and as long as he keeps his coronet in
the pocket of his baggy pants—well, we don't
mind.

A horrible story is being whispered-round
one of the N.S.W. Government departments. A

A clever Sydney reporter thus lost his
appointment. He was, so goes the story, sent to
report a lecture by a suburban parson, and while
the dull discourse was proceeding he rested— the
matter was too dismal even for his paper. So he
wrote out a slip and passed it on to the represen-
tative of the other daily—“ How much are_ you
making of this d d rot? I mean to cut it off
with 25 lines.” The other man held up two
fingers, meaning “ two sticks,” at which his
friend nodded approvingly, and neither took any
more notes. That evening the parson and his
friends found on the hall-floor the note quoted
above, and—and there you are! They went to
the office, and the reporter was sacked ” for
Blasphemy.

We have received Messrs T. Cook and
Sons’ “ Unicode,” a handy little book which
professes to furnish a telegraphic code to suit all
the ordinary emergencies of life. Unfortunately
the individual who drafted it seems to have had
no idea what are the ordinary emergencies of life
—his ignorance in this respect is lamentable and
awful. In all the book, for instance, there isn't a
single code word to express the sentence : “ Fly
instantly; all is discovered !” Yet that is a
message which is more in request than any other
we know of, and it wants to be sent
promptly, and in a disguU d form. Nor is
there one single form which means “ bank
burst ; no assets ; lie low, shareholders look-
ing for you with guns.” There are 179 separate
code words for racing telegrams, and not one of
them means : “ Hire Moses to stiffen the animal,”
or “Owner squared,” or “Horse poisoned as
arranged.” Then there are several dozen abbrevia-
tions for such law telegrams as “Judge has com-
menced his summing up,” or “Opinion of Counsel
is favourable,” aiid never a solitary code for
“ Engage perjurer promptly,” or “ Forge affidavit
and make liostile witness drunk,” or “ Hire
bruiser to bash plaintiff.” It isn't much of a book
when all these things are left out. At any rate,
it won’t do for Australia.

The Sydney D.T. reports this memorable
fact: —
It has recently transpired that among the employes in
the catering department of N.S.W. Parliament House is a
gentleman connected with an old and titled family of the
United Kingdom. The name of this gentleman is Mr.
, who, under an assumed name, has for
some time been employed in .the buildings. He is the
son 0 f , a cousin of the Baronet of Blanks-
town, and who is head of the house of > which is
a very ancient Irish family.
This looks so very probable that we wouldn’t be
surprised to hear that all the rest of the waiters
were baronets also. When the British nobleman
of any sort or variety goes out to earn his own
living he generally takes to rushing about with
a towel in a restaurant. The individual who is
grovelled to in England, when he finds his level in
a democratic community, straightway starts to
grovel himself, and take small tips, and wash
dishes, and become a sort of male housemaid and
potato-peeler. The billet suits him. There is an
undefinable relationship between the British aris-
tocracy and the flunkey, therefore when the
aristocrat becomes a flunkey no one notices the
difference, and when the flunkey passes himself
off as a nobleman no one notices the difference
either. Whenever a bogus earl is arrested for
cashing valueless cheques in Australia it invari-
ably transpires that he has been a valet, because
the valet looks so like an earl, and the earl looks
so horribly like a valet that they are practically
one and the same animal.

Talking of Victorian art, a few local men
have turned out a cycloramic picture, “The
Defeat of the Spanish Armada,” which is certain
to make a sensation at the Tasmanian Exhibition,
Even when considered on “the straight,” this
long marine subject is a genuine success. When
completed, toned down with gunpowder smoke
and duly fixed-up behind a bold, rocky fore-
ground, it should prove a first-class shilling show.
As a sea piece “The Armada” is a novelty in
oycloramas, also, it has the advantage of calling
attention to the revered idea that Britain
rules the waves. To this end the designer has
been careful to give the combatants a smooth sea
and no favour, instead of throwing in all the luck
on the weaker side. The immense superiority of
one Englishman over forty Spaniards can
be taken in at a glance. Mr. G. F. Yenner-
mark, who has painted an attractive ocean and
sky, designed the scheme of battle ; Fred. Knee-
bone, Rccknell, Gordon Coutts, and Hugh
Patterson, being responsible for most of the fore-
ground, galleons, figures, and etceteras. The
Vagabond is understood to have written the usual
threepenny pamphlet, whilst an Elizabethan
lecture on the Armada and its destruction has
been constructed, on scientific principles, by
Victor Daley.

The la ( est Victorian Artists’ Exhibition
is chiefly remarkable for a humorous catalogue,
in which the exhibitors have set prices upon their
gems of art. Gordon Frazer, for instance, asks a
mere trifle of .£(500 for his “ Cannibal Feast in
the Island of Tauna,” an “ unfinished ” study of a
sort of walk round by a number of washed-oub
niggers, in the depths of a new tint of green
forest. A colossal apparition, which may be
intended for a live heathen, or a wooden god,
stands erect in the left foreground, and the diffi-
culty of discovering what part this bloated mon-
strosity plays in the corroboree constitutes the
charm of the picture, and has, presumably, a lot to
do with its price. Explorer Stanley was brought
up in triumph by Gordon Frazer to view this
great work, but he tore himself away without
producing a cheque-book and buying the treasure
on the spot. Another waggish item on the cata-
logue is £l7O for M'Cubbiu’s pure Aus-
tralian subject, “The Runaway.” There aie
three human figures and an alleged horse
visible on the fair-face of M'C.’s landscape,
but the runaway (presumably a bullock, a goat, or
a wild, untamed rooster) seems lost in the distance.
Interest centres in a clean-shaven actor, or gentle-
man fresh from gaol, who has taken to the
bush because one of his arms is two yards long
from shoulder to elbow, and in the back view of
an aged person with a hand like a loin chop cut to
a point at the scrag end. Tennyson Cole's water
colour “ In Marble Halls ” is another cheap thing.
The subject is seemingly a bright-faced parlour-
maid draped in a yellow bed-curtain. She is a
nice girl enough in her way, and might be trusted
to clean up and do mo tof the washing for twelve
shillings a week, though in the capacity of a high-
toned Toorakian at £2(52 10s. she strikes one as a
failure. If the price of a picture is what it will
fetch there can be no doubt that none of the
exhibits in the V.A.E. are priceless. Some of
them are well worth taking at catalogue figures,
and others will always fetch a trifle as curiosities.

“Songs of the South."
Of the multitude of books there is no end ; and
most books had been better never written,
never printed and never read. Nearly every-
thing that is worth doing has been done ’better
than anyone can expect to cjfl it>, but this con-
sideration Inis 1191 pr'eVeflied Mr. John Bernard
HHarA’, M.A., from putting forth a little
volume which he calls “ Songs of the South ”
presumably touching Australia somewhat,
though a very careful examination fails
altogether to show in what particular—occult
or otherwise. “ Songs of the South ” arc really
not songs at all, or “ poems ” in any sense what-
soever. They are, indeed, very decent samples
of vacation verse-=tho sort of verse One Wight

A perusal of Mr. O’Hara’s pages reveals
quite a wealth of classical syllables. Here are
a few : Amphion, Aurora, Phosphor, Orion,
Atlas, Apollo, Oceanus—he is strong on Apollo
and Oceanus Hesper, Hesperian, lonian,
Amalthea, Hades, Mysian, iHflllisj ifMati;
Kuroclydon. Hypetbpreun, Chloe, Lipara,
Biiropa-, Hesperidfls, Neptune, Dian, &c., &c.,
He speaks rapturously of ‘ ‘ lonian waters,”
the Naiads, the Sphinx, “ Syrian years,”
“ Hades’ portal,” Lotus-ease, the Nymphs,
“ Elysian bowers,” et hoc genus omne ; and his
clouds are not clouds, but “swift Nimbi.”
When he desires a variation of imagery he
finds it in such phrases as “ the Galiph of the
East ” and “ Pharaoh’s kine-.” He is strflngely
dumb on the purely- Australian side, bht waxes
weirdly eloquent aiient Hy-Sruzil uud El-
dorado, and finds a remarkable pleasure in
apostrophizing Azrael and the Yule-King. In
short, Mr. O’Hara iS anything but Australian.
His verse is the poetry Of lordly and florid
adjectives and imported stock phrases re-
miniscential of much reading df the English
poets of Gray 9 time, when no man could write
half-a-dozen lines without as many invocations
to the Muses, or the tuneful Nine, or the rosy-
fingered Dawn.

Mr. O’Hara revels in “ hyaline waters,” and
“ eastern gales ” that “ brook ” the presence of
ships. He remembers “halcyon days;” he
sings “ the holy hymn of hills s” he wanders in
“dreamy dells ” and “ bdsky dells >” and when
he lies dflwfl at flight he iildulges in “ ambrosial
SlhUp. ’ ThroUghodt his book we hear of little
gls'e than “ tasselled wheat” and “babbling
brooks “ shining zones ” and “shining oriels;”
“ singing seas ” and “ astral flowers ;” “ glanc-
ing prows ” and “ honeyed hours.” He grows
aesthetic over “amorous springs,” “ Adonian
bloom,” and “ Zidonian days.” He tells of
“what time the empyrean glowed,” and how
Aurora, “ the goddess, trode bright rosy to her
golden car.” Ho calls the sun “ the oriflamme
of day,” and he speaks also of “ the sun-god’s
gleaming eir so Aurora lias not a monopoly
of vehicular transit. In Mr. O’Hara’s pages,
“ the starlets flee and dip their foreheads iri the
wave,” “orient pyres ’ Hood all the Eastern
§Uy, which glows like “lustrous haunts of
Paradise.” Up and down his verses “the
autumnal rose-down blows,” and “fringing
foam flowers ” festoon them everywhere.

Mr. O’Hara’s volume is the true college-bdy’s
vacation-poetry exercise, and there: is very little
of “the Soflth” in it, save hete and there a
reference to “ trackless Austral Wilds, ” In a
poem called “The Wreck,” twenty years ai e
alluded to as “twenty suns”—for, from the
context, he certainly medns years. The bulk of
the book is devoted to the month of October—
but why ? Are there not in Australia half-a-
dozen months with very similar characteristics ?
There is very little that is quotable, because
there is hardly anything Australian in Mr.
O'Hara’s verse. He does certainly allude
rather weakly to the “ wattle’’—but this is
hardly a recommendation to our wattle-wearied
cars. His poem, “In Memory of Henry Ken-
dall,” begins thus gruesomely :
Once more revolves the sounding key,
The bolts of death are drawn—
awkwardly suggesting to people who know no
better that the bard was gibbeted out of life
in the good old fashion. This poem, says the
Loudon Saturday Review, is worthy of Ken-
dall himself. Which is very sad, and only shows
what they think of our literature “at Home,”
In “A Christmas Tryst ” the poet rather
ineffectively deals—(in the three last stanzas) —
with the incident so daintily treated by John
Farrell in his “ Bell of the Ly-ee-moon.” Long-
fellow found that one cannot make poetry out of
unmeaning native phrases, and “Hiawatha” is
nothing but a splendid failure. Mr. O’Hara
essays an “Aboriginal Death-song,” in which
he repeats Longfellow’s mistake, and thereby
spoils something that promises better in the
opening lines. Of course, there is the usual
versified drivel over the fate of Gordon, who
seems to awaken nearly as much interest in the
poet’s breast as Oceanus or Phosphor—whom,
we are very sorry to learn—are now quite dead.
Certain English critical journals, to wit : the
Saturday Review, the World, the Spectator,
the Speaker, the National Observer, and the
Review of Reviews, express opinions widely
different from those held by The Bulletin
concerning Mr. O’Hara’s verse, but this is
doubtless due to several not very occult causes,
and only show how very “advanced” the
publisher’s trade is becoming. The volume is
well-printed and tastefully behind; and is otheF
wise deserving of a better fate.

put his immense ears in at the door, and took an
observation, and then he meanly gave Mary away.
The only consolation which the injured lady has
got is that her voice is officially recognised and
entered in the books at the police-office as being
music, whereas the present writer might discourse
songs in anybody’s licensed premises for eighteen
consecutive hours, and not produce music within
the meaning of the Act once. Still, if we were
Mary we would get level with that officer.
There are various ways of doing it, but probably
the shortest and most efficacious would be to hire
a lovely slavey and let her—for a consideration —

footing. If the courts fine the man who runs a
consultation, they should also fine every man who
takes a ticket in it; when they gaol the three-card
individual they should also gaol the man who
plays with him ; and when they jump on the pub-
lican who sells after hours they should likewise
jump on the citizen who drinks after hours. The
consultation individual can’t run his business
unless somebody takes tickets ; and the three-
card fiend can’t play his game unless fomebody
plays with him ; and the publican can’t sell after
hours unless somebody drinks after hours. Neither
can any man sell liquor without a license unless
somebody buys liquor from a man without a
license ; and if it is fair and reasonable to penalise
the person who does one-half of the transaction,
it is equally reasonable for the man who does the
other half.— Titus.
It is easier to wish what you think, than
think what you wish.
The Theatre Royal Hotel, Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is-provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange, curious
and refreshing drinks known in the United States
can be obtained. Their name is legion, but among
them may be mentioned champagne cocktails,
gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—probably the
noblest liquor known to man—imperial punch,
Manhattan cocktails, and many others. All
mixed by American bar-keeps. James A. Walsh,

“A Race that Can Stand the Climate."
Dear Bulletin, - Is it presumptuous for me to differ from
Rudyard Kipling on the subject of India ? Things must
have altered in 29 years if you can get a. race by jhtfet®
marriage with the natives;, Let hie fjjtplain ivhat I Ifieah;
The Inspector-General of Hospitals in the very loku’s of
Mr. Kipling told me that the Eurasian, or half-caste rate;
did not, as a rule, survive the third generation, except irl
a puny, imbecile or vicious pattern ; that they threw back
to the more impotent type of their progenitors and vir-
tually failed. Now, this may, by hygiene, manners,
moials, and education, have been altered; otherwise it
would be necessary to find, from the best specimens
of the two races, males for marriage with the females
of the opposite colour, and a constant supply
of the Saint, or ttt establish haras, but, of course, both
plans tvbuld be illegal and in violation of current ideas.
It is known well in India that country-bred horses are
valueless as sires at the stud. Even those bred in the
studs of Haupper, Kurnaul and Buxar are relegated to
the list. Again, the Eurasian caialry or Lahore Light
Horse Were a lamentable failure, I believe, for immorality.
Here let hie state that the Commanding officer cut his
throat bn the dissolution bf the eorpS; I got his im-
ported spaniel EloSs; ,knd a lot of his fyihb; Aiid fvhjteS
object much to marry half-castes. A lady i knew died
because her children were chee-chees; she never knew
that her fair-haired husband was a Eurasian. And again,
the natives want either a white or one of their own caste.
Certainly the Rajah of P married a Eurasian. Result,
separation. I could suggest a far better plan (but it is
too late) than R. K.’s. If the old shakers of the Pagoda-
breed had been left under tender John Company: if
racial religion and distinction had been encouraged, and
the ancient customs of the Hindoos, Mussulmans, et hoe
Wins mm, been left as fount), then England (curse it 1
Ss with. Stanley, It’s Englahd; nbt Btitaih); then I say,
England could have held the power. You know what
John Price said about convicts—“ One would watch the
other.” I think flock-masters will understand what I
have been driving at when I ask them this. Do they ever
use cross-bred rams or ewes as parents for the type of
sheep that they want to breed? Mind you, I only ask for
information. I am not a sheepy man. I never notice
stud cross-brcds offered for sale. So let Kipling’s England
(I’m a Scotchman) trust to her soldiers of'all sorts. Now
that there is much education among the natives, I fancy
that they have savet enough to prefer John Bull
(including Pitt and Sandy) to the Bear, but 1 hope and (if
I pray) I pray that when the battle of Dera Ishraail
Khan, or Serinugger, or Bhimbur, takes place between
England (as before) and Russia, dear Bulletin, I say I
pray that your special correspondent will be—Yours.

Emin Pasha is getting a big army together

“ Braeside ” Allen need not alarm himself
about the rabbits walking over the top of the
“stiffnrs” into Queensland. When the rabbit-
proof fence was being erected between Barringun
and Hungerford, rabbits were regularly caught
and deposited on the Bananaland side to save
them from becoming extinct in that sinful country
Since the vines supplied to the Austrian
Government by America have turned bht to be
infected by phyloxera, Australian vignerons will
hardly know where to obtain vines free from the
insect. Perhaps few of our wine-producers are
aware that, in the vicinity of the Hodgkinson,
North Queensland, a wild vine flourishes. It is
similar in habit to the cultivated variety, growing
bunches of edible grapes devoid of acidity, like all
tropical fruits.
A new-chum lately received a letter from
England, and, being unable to read, took it to the
local publican. The publican w y as no better
scholar than the bumpkin, but, disguising his
ignorance, he opened the letter and broke into a
loud guffaw. “Great fun at home, Bill,” he
exclaimed; “can’t read it for laughing. Get
Jack, the blacksmith, to go through it.’’ The
letter apprised the recipient of his mother’s death,
so, after Jack had gone through its pages, Hodge
returned and wiped the verandah with the grinning
publican.
Avoid the “well dressed” person, given
to wearing a heavy frock-coat on a stifling mid-
summer day, wdio systematically refers to V.R.
as “ Her Majesty.” That man is either a dreary
ass, or a professional humbug. Avoid him as you
avoid his moist, unpleasant first cousin, tbe man
who calls a bad sermon “an excellent discourse.”
Also avoid the humbler, but “pushing” indivi-
duals, who won’t think of keeping their seats in a
railway-carriage whilst he of the heavy frock-coat
is standing. And, above all, steer clear of the ill-
conditioned fraud of a radical, who boasts of his
ignorance, makes an everlasting parade of bis
grimy hands, and talks of a Republic as a place
where all men spit alike.
Dear Bulletin, — Apropos your paragraph
a few weeks back re Maytown, N.Q., and its
Chinese storekeepers, why Maytown only ? The
same applies to most or nearly all northern town-
ships where I have been. At L——, a mining
township, where I visited recently, and where
unionism was much en evidence, many members,
including the local union secretary, dealt with
Chinese storekeepers, Europeans being equally
handy. The baker was a Chow, with a nigger for
mate. One morning I had occasion to call early
at the “bakery”—a wretched hovel, ten feet
square. On a rough and rather “multy ’’-looking
table was the bread, and immediately over, about
three feet above, on a bunk composed of a few
loose slabs, were the Chow and his colored mate en-
joying an early morning smoke, the roof being
evidently used as a spittoon ! And this baker was
patronised by unionists ! Yet the “Chinesemust
go”—of course they must. —Yours, Argonaut.

to go past. He never goes to bed, and seldom has
time to eat. In his younger days - nobody knows
how old he is, but judging by all he has done and
all the places he has visited he should be about

earth, and many other things besides. He
appeared as a skater at Montreal jn 71; he was
a journalist in Maoriland,' and' cast a radi-

1878, when he managed the Sir Joseph Banks,

afterwards made a sensational appearance in
London. Then he rinked all over Europe and the
more civilised parts of Africa, and, reappearing in
Sydney, he opened the Protestant Hall as a skat-
ing establishment, and after that he roamed all
through this continent and most of Asia, and then
drifted back once more to Australia. During

he has done nearly everything else that one man
could do, and he has been everywhere, and
inserted his shiny hat and inventive brain into
nearly every mystery between earth and heaven.

family will at once notice that he and his belong-

the increased size of the entrances, instead of
having to creep in by detachments as in the days
before the fire. The larger entrances have also
the effect of making the various halls and divisions
brighter. The aquarium is sure to prove more
practical than heretofore. The latest improve-
ments have been introduced in the way of
aerating the tanks, and the tanks themselves will
display—if one may suppose that a fish has the
study of comfort at heart—a study for the comfort
of the fish which are to be incarcerated in them.
VIEW FROM THE GLEN.
Surmounting the whole building is a new dome
45ft. in height, which greatly adds to its appear-
ance. The grounds have been still further im-
proved for the accommodation of picnic parties
and general amusement. The skating rink has
been placed in thorough order, and although
skating is not the “ rage ” it was a few j r ears ago,
no holiday goes by at Bondi but the rink has its
full share of votaries.

On July 14 the contract was signed with Messrs.
Bignell and Clark for erection of new building,
and on the same day work was commenced to erect
the present palace. Too much credit cannot be
given to the Commercial Union Assurance Cos.
(Mr. J. St. Vincent Welch, manager) who rein-
stated the building, thus taking all trouble off the
shoulders of the proprietor in the re-erection, and
for the quickness and despatch with which all
claims were settled. It may be mentioned that
no sooner had the Commercial Union signed the
contract for the rebuilding, than they cabled to
England to have specially manufactured the
peculiar heavy plate-glass of lin. in thickness,
which has now been placed in position in the
tanks within seven days of arrival of same by
mail steamer. The public may be surprised to
learn that the cost of these pieces of plate-glass
and their fittings was no less than .£6OO. Mr.
Alfred Wyburd, the enterprising proprietor of
these most beautiful pleasure-grounds, has left no
stone unturned to make the Aquarium and the
rest of his property a haven for the weary, and
the very spot for seeking pleasure, health and
recreation.
To-day (Thursday) the new Aquarium will
be officially opened under the patronage* of the
Mayor and Aldermen of Sydney, the United
Grand Lodge of Freemasons, Lord Sheffield, and
the English team of cricketers, including the
famous veteran, Dr. W. G. Grace, the N.S.W.
Cricketing Association, and the cycling, football,
rowing and yachting clubs of Sydney. Also, by
way of lending further eclat to the occasion, there
will be present
Geo. Rignold and Company of Her Majesty’s
Theatre.
Messrs. MacMahon and the Evangeline Company
of the Theatre Royal.
Messrs. Brough and Boucicault and Company of
the Criterion Theatre.
Messrs. Hiscocks and Wilson and Miss Jenny
Lee’s Company, of the Garrick Theatre.
Mr. Frank Smith and his full company from the
Alhambra and the Sir Joseph Banks, Botany,
Superintendent Bear and the Metropolitan Fire
Brigades,
and nearly everybody else of any public import-
ance. The orchestra of the Theatre Royal will
render the overture of “Evangeline,” conducted
by Mr. Rice, the composer, and no effort will be
spared to make the shew the greatest of its kind
upon record.

Extract from Sydney Morning Herald, referring t°
the exhibits in the United States Court, Centennial Inter"
national Exhibition, Melbourne, says;—“A little more to
the westward, the visitor finds a platform on which are
placed a number of Hamraoquette Reclining Chairs, one
of the latest things from that ingenious class of Americans
who devote their lives to the invention of objects which
shall minister to the fastidious tastes of the invalid, or
meet the luxurious demands of the wealthy. The Ham-
moquette Chair, constructed mainly of American ash,
colored to resemble mahogany, is shown by R. B. Jones,
6 Bridge street, Sydney, and can, at will, be made to
assume a great variety of shapes. It is difficult to con-
ceive a more valuable addition to a sick room, library,
study, or verandah, than the Hammoquette Chair must
prove.”
Parliament House, Melbourne.
Mr. R. B. Jones,
Dear Sir,—ln reply to your letter of Bth instant, I
have much pleasure in stating that the nine chairs \
purchased from you have given me every satisfaction.
Yours truly,

Old Cockburn, the Sydney auctioneer of a
quarter of a century ago, had occasion once to
appear before Judge Cheeke in the Supreme Court.
Old “Cocky” was known to have been “sent
out,” and the opposing counsel—Mathew Henry
Stephen—was anxious to have the fact established.
As Cockburn never denied it, that was not hard
to establish, but M.H.S. was anxious to know
also who he was. Cockburn drew himself up to
his full height and said; “My name is Henry
Digby Cockburn, son of Alexander Cockburn,
grandson of Sir Alexander Cockburn and of Lord
Lyttelton, and brotlu r of the Right Honorable Sir
Alexander Cockburn, Lord Chief Justice of Eng-
land —better blood than flows in your old father’s
veins.” “ Tut, tut 1” growled old Chctke ; “you
must not talk like that.” But he enjoyed the
“ scraping ” also, though Mathew Henry did not.
Old Cockburn, whatever his Old-Country fault
might have been-it was a paltry one enough—
was highly respected in commercin' Sydney. He
had his salerooms where the Criterion Theatre
now stands. For coarse abuse his tongue- was
unequalled even amongst the knights of the
hammer.

celebrated linn of hatters. B. Mountcastle & Sons,

Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her work unimpeded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate, constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
'.affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
a “Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be maintained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Read the Reports from Sydney Papers,
The Australian Temperance World saysWe can
thoroughly recommend it as a genuine treatment that
must benefit most all disorders. It requires no outlay
after purchasing the pampnlet. It is based upon
thoroughly hygienic principles, and wo believe every
thorough user must receive benefit. One great considera-
tion with ladies will be that it secures a clear skin and
speedily does away with a muddy complexion, and
removes all eruptions arising from diseased conditions of
the blood. We have made ourselves familiar with the
pamphlet, and heartily endorse it.’ :
Presbyterian, of July 4, says;—-“We have seen the
pamphlet, and can thoroughly recommend its rationale.”
The Freeman's JouRNALsaysAfter a careful perusal
of the pamphlet we have no hesitancy in recommending
the treatment which Dr. Hall discovered.”
The Sydney Mail says:—“ We have seen the pamphlet,
and, although we cannot reveal its secrets, we can bear
testimony to the bona-fides of the advertisement.”
Martin’s Home and Farm says;—“ We can recommend
it as a genuine thing.”
The Adltralian Star says:—“It is thoroughly purify-
ing. hygienic, and rational in the highest degree.”
Truth says;—“ It is beyond a doubt all that is claimed
for it.”
Sunday Times says:—“It will, we believe, where cure
is not possible, assist in alleviating ; and to folks suffering
from habitual constipation, indigestion, deficient cir-
culation, and poorness of blood, it cannot fail to be of
benefit.” ,, . , . ’
Brisbane Evening Observer saysA feature of the
treatment is that it requires no extra expense after the
first cost of the pamphlet, and can be applied as easily in
the bush as in the city.”
The Echo, Bulletin, and other leading papers speak in
similar unqualified terms.
Australian Independent says;—“To suffering humanity
we regard the discovery as a wonderful boon.”
Dr.’ Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment-
more than 20 years ago. In writing to a friend,
about a year ago, he gives the following
* * * “Nearlv twenty years ago in this city Dr. A.
Wilford Hall gave me privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered and adopted some
twenty years before, and which he had practised con-
tinuously upon himself up to that time. The history
included an account of the failure of the health, the
reasonings and conclusions which led him to adopt the
treatment, his rapid restoration to health, &c. From the
time of his first mention of it to me I have been entirely
satisfied that it saved him from a lingering consumption
and death ; and that in the years following, as I have evi-
dence to satisfy me, its continued practice has so affected
the nutrient and eliminating functions as to give to his
physical structure a greater degree of solidity, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. I learn that he has persistently
continued the treatment to the present time - forty years
in all-and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the ‘ bloom of youth,’
though he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in my prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due to him for
whatever scientific advances he may be able to unfold in
the line of assisting nature to ward off disease,and in the
restoration of health.— R. F. Stevens, M.D.”
“Sydney, 11th August, 1891.
“ Mr. J. C. Oakman.—Dear Sir,—I have great pleasure
in recommending Dr. A. Wilford Hall’s treatment, as 1
have derived great benefit from its use. I have for years
been suffering from torpid liver, dyspepsia, constipation,
and the last two years from inward piles ; but after the
use of Dr. A. W.'Hall’s treatment for about two months
I find myself entirely cured of that very painful com-
plaint the piles, and all my other troubles are getting
gradually less, and I firmly believe that a continuation of
this treatment will restore me to perfect health again. I
shall be very happy to give any one any further informa-
tion if deserved.—Yours very truly, Robert Tarin, 231
Goulburn-street, Surry Hills.”
“ Wellshot Station, 1st August, 1891.
“ Mr. J. C. Oakman, 8 O’Connell-street, Sydney.—Dear
Sir,—Yours of July 14 to hand. Thank you very much
|or your kind offer, to help me in case I could not under-
stand thoroughly the pamphlet or if I found difficulty in
applying the t rcalnient. 11 is not 1 he case. I understand
English as well as French', and as for- the treatment it has
already clone a world of good, and the pamphlet is worth
hundred times the money. If it had been translated in
French I would have advised some friends and
relations at home to buy it. This is the
reason why I was asking, and I hope it will soon
be translated in every known language and spread
all over the world. 1 have been suffering from dyspepsia
for the last 20 years, and a few days of this treatment
has done me more good and given me more relief than
all the remedies 1 ever tried before.—1 am, dear sir, yours
faithfully, . Jude Derbexy.”
The distinguished pulpit-orator and evangelist
Rev. Miles Grant, Boston, Mass., writes
October 7 :
“ your wonderful discovery, I take much
pleasure in saying I am delighted with its effects upon
my system. I sent for it that I might know its influence
on a healthy person, I have now used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life. The treatment produces a general refreshing, hi- '
vigoraling effect: sharpens my appetite, sweetens my
sleep, and makes me feel as though I had anew lease of
life. 1 have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
1 have lieard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, ‘ I would not
take SSO for it. It knocks the bottom out of disease.’ I
can say for myself I never spent cash to better advantage
than when I bought your pamphlet—Your brother in
Christ, Miles Grant.”
“ Sydney, June 3,1891.
“ Mr. Oakman.—Dear Sir, —I have now used for one
month the treatment described in Dr. A. VV. Hall's
health pamphlet, and I certainly feel a wonderful
improvement in health, so great that I cannot describe
how very different my feelings are, for life is now enjoy-
able ; but for nine years past it has often been very
miserable. In the head 1 have suffered dreadfully, owing
to softening of the brain, and often partial temporary
paralysis of tongue, and other parts; also frequent
severe pains at the heart, with less and less capacity for
work, and other troubles, all of which have ceased to
trouble me except a slight occasional reminder at the
heart. lam exceedingly thankful to the Almighty, and
to Dr. Hall, and yourself, that I am so well, for a month
ago I felt as if some dreadful climax was near.—Yours
truly, Susan E. Hawkins, 58 Henry-street, Leichhardt,
N.S.'W.”
“ Glcnburn Public School, Wiseman's Creek,
“ August 14,1891.
“J. C. Oakman. Dear Sir,—l have very much pleasure in
testifyingto the efficiency of Dr. Hall'shygienic treatment.
1 have been a sufferer from indigestion and constipation
in its worst forms for the last eight years, and during
that time I have consulted four (4) medical practitioners
of great skill, but have received very little relief. I have
used a terrible lot of pills and patent medicines. At first
they used to give me a certain amount of relief, but for
six months before using Dr. Hall’s remedy they were quite
useless. For three months before using the hygienic'
treatment I suffered terrible pain in my stomach and
bowels, especially at night. I could not sleep but very
little, and had frightful dreams. Mrs. MTnnes had to put
mustard plasters and hot flannels across my stomach
before I could get any relief. 1 have been using the
hygienic treatinent for five weeks, and thank God it has
given me great relief. Since 1 have started to use it I
have not felt any pain, and can sleep quite sound every
night. I have not felt the slightest touch of indigestion;
since, and can eat three hearty, good meals every day.
Everybody says how well 1 begin to look. My wife and
daughter also use it with good results. I have not the
slightest doubt but that it will cure diseases of the
stomach, liver, kidney, and bowels.—Faithfully yours,

Two Sides of the Galah Mountain.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Chap. I,— The Sunny Side.
Ihe sun rises redder over the Barrelbung Plain,
glares more fiercely on the northern side of the
Calah Mountain, and sets apparently at Geebung
Swamp with a more virulent final flash than it
would dare to do if justice and equality were its
mottoes.
So thinks the look-out man who, from October
till March, is sent by the manager of Dummigat
station to look out for bush-fires. The highest
point of the mountain is a trigonometrical station,
and there a whirly, mia-mia, bush-house, or what-
ever you like to call it, has been erected by suc-
cessive boundary-riders, who have given a week’s
notice because “the job is hell.” Such has been
the time-honoured expression that has deterred
many a good man from applying for a billet at
Uummigat. Not so, however, with Brandy
Malone, who was sent by chance as an emergency-
man when the tenth sentry had cursed the Galah
and died, as far as employment there for the
future was concerned.
Brandy Malone was not so called from love of
the spirit named, but only to distinguish him from
W hisky Malone, whose nose and name betray his
failing. This same Malone said he liked the job,
was willing to finish the season at it instead of in
the paddocks, and was public!y, in an audience of
ai^ ce<^ . ky Gentle Machree, the manager.
Mr. Machree is a terror to swear.
So Brandy Malone took an axe and improved
the shelter-house ; and a book, which he did not
read; and a billy and pannikin, and a water-bag,
and rode slowly every morning up to the Look-out,
where he remained till sundown.
He had been a month at this game, when about
three in the afternoon he saw a pillar of smoke
just over Geebung Swamp. At 3.15 he arrived at
a gallop to warn the manager and men, but no
manager or men were there. The cook even was
away--all gone to the fire except a crippled pen-
sioner who got a pound a week for not living on a
selection which he had taken up.
This man told Brandy Malone that the Geebung
people had sent over about 11 a.m. for all hands
and the cook, as well as a water-cart, and any
available grog, because the cultivation paddock
was in a blaze.
Ihen Malone pondered, and finally made up his
mind to wait at Uummigat.
I think I said that Mr. Machree was called the
Gentle One in irony. He was not gentle, and
hardly genteel that night. lie accused Malone of
sleeping, of being away at a pub., or reading, and
told him to go to etcetera out of this. Here endeth
Malone s career as servant to Mr., alias the Gentle,
Machree.
Chapter ll.— The Shady Side.
No more fertile or blessed spot exists in this
province than the southern side of the Galah. The
hill is so-called because all along the creek
at its base, millions of galah parrots chatter and
talk and build nests and breed and rear more
chatterers. The land is good, and the people
moderately honest. Farmers have taken up
ground, and their sons and daughters; yes, nieces
and nephews ; even blind cousins and widowed
poor relations, but none of them have such a
scope of country as the Hosts, an apt name,
because they are countless. The last 040 acres
tacked to the clan is at the bottom of the Galah.
A niece, just out from the old land, had paid her
(.) deposit for this piece of land, and slept on it
once or twice a year, not oftener, because it was so
lonely. She was gradually becoming acclimatised,
and could ride, milk, cut up a sheep, and bake
bread, when an extraordinary change took place
in her ways. She became religious ! Then she
said to her Aunt: “Aunty Kate, dear Aunty,
don’t think me crusty, or cronk, or cranky.
Conscientiously, I must and will live on
my selection. I cannot say that I live
there unless I really do.” This was about a month
before the big fire at Geebung Swamp. Aunt
Host rather admired the girl for this ; Uncle Host
called her a d d idiot; Cousin Jack agreed
with his father; Cousin Mary agreed with the
mother; but Bella Host went to live on her
square-mile at the foot of the Galah.
Chap. lll.— The Summit.
“Then we’ll go to-morrow to the township and
get married by the Police Magistrate. If you
like we’ll get a parson afterwards.” “ All right,
Brandy, dear ; and won’t uncle and the rest dance
a bit ! Good gracious, look at the smoke over
the Geebungs!”
LATEST EDITION:
FAREWELL.
Gentle Machree was about to mount his horse,
when Brandy Malone rode up. It was just after
breakfast, but then the Gentle One always drank
Bass’s ale for breakfast. Nothing makes a man
swear at 7.30 a.m. so much as breakfasting at
seven on porridge and beer. Mr. Ma’one looked
clean and neat and nice. He wore a blue necktie
and leggings. Of course he had other togs on,
but the tie and the spats were the mo_t catching.
To him Mr. Machree: “What the-what the—
what—d you, what do you want?”
“ I just rode over to say that there’s about 20
of your sheep among mine, and you might send a
man to fetch them. They're hand-drafting them
now.” This was not true ; she was doing the hand-
drafting, not they.
“ What blanky sheep ? Where have you sheep ?
Signs on it ! Send I may live ! What do you
mean ? ”
Bub Brandy Malone, being in a necktie and leg-
gings, acted the gentleman—giving the soft
answer that turneth away wrath, thus ; “ At my
little station, called Undercliff, just on the other
side of the Galah ! 11l keep them in.till midday.”
That afternoon Mr. Machree had a fit.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
W. G. Grace is “starred,” in three-feet capitals
on the Melbourne hoardings. Across the veteran’s
gigantic name is pasted a long, slim announcement that
Lord Sheffield’s team will appear on certain dates. This
is no doubt the most business-like way of advertising the
new show, seeing that R. S. Smythe is content to let the
postered name of “Stanley ’’speak for itself. Grace is a
Digger man than Stanley amongst any English-speaking
community, and a far more interesting performer to boot.
» * *
Melbourne city fathers tried their hardest to
make an ass of W. G. Grace at the Town-hall reception.
Not content with luring him into the municipal throne-
chair and hanging chains round his broad shoulders, they
wanted to perpetrate the elephantine foolery of a
“ swearing-in,” for which the champion was not ‘ on,
however. He looked, in fact, as though he thought he
hadn’t been dragged there for the purpose of inciting a
mob of stoutish gentlemen-very few of whom could hit
a haystack with a cricket-ball, or a ball with a haystack
to indulge in elevated civic “humour” at his expense.
These “ cordial receptions” become very trying when the
weather is warm and the cordial is unlimited and gratis.
* # #
The hopes of the N.S.W. team in the approach-
ing matches with Grace & Cos. are based on a sticky
wicket, and Chas. Turner, Esq., escaping the influenza.
Ferris (now turned Englishman) Turner’s fellow agent in
Sydney victories, has left no successor. The only other
tried bowler is Charlton, who at present is in better
batting than bowling form. The N.S.W. batsmen have
to face Lohmann, Attewell, Peel, Briggs, Grace, and
Sharpe—all veteran trundlers, so the match seems like
heigho! ho ! for the Britishers. The N.S.W. team have
evinced little enthusiasm. One fine afternoon lately only
Jones and Charlton, out of the 20 selected to practice,
turned up at the “ Asso.”
• • *
After the generation of Murdoch, Spoff., the
Bannermen, Palmer, M'Donnell, and so on, it is as with
extinct volcanoes.
* * •
It is suggested that, as a means of reviving
interest in cricket, an interprovincial “old identities”
match be played in Sydney on an early date.
• # •
Dear Bulletin, — Dave Soott, the Melbourne
cricket “ Almanac,” has the parochial “ cheek ” to suggest
that Australia should have its own particular game of
cricket. Dave’s idea is to ring the batting team off at 3
p.m. and let the other side have an innings, so that the
public might study the batting and fielding of both teams
in one day. It is hard to say whether players or public
would be the sooner sick of such an idiotic innovation.
The tail-end of a strong team might play in half-a-dozen
successive matches without getting a show to bat at all,
inasmuch as weaker sides would lose twenty wickets for
fewer runs than were scored to the first seven of their
opponents. Any attempt to meet this objection by some-
times putting in the “tail” first, and keeping back the
“ cracks” until the last, would knock half the sense out
of cricket. The public, for their part, wouldn’t roll up on
the possible chance of seeing Giffen carry out his bat for
a “ duck.” Twenty likely instances might be suggested
to prove the absurdity of Dave Scott’s windy proposition,
which he hangs on to the utterly false argument that
people in England have more time than the Australians
to follow a big match for three or four days on a stretch.
Nobody knows better than Scott that matches never
extend over four days in England, that Australian batting
has become slower than the “home” play, and that a
little ginger is the only thing required to make cricket
out here (and more particularly in Victoria) as palatable
to the public as it was before the over-rated and conceit-
saturated “giants” of eight years ago us'xl to drag out
their stupid gate-money matches into thejifth day.—F.E.
# ' * *
The worst Victorian Eleven on record has met
the best English one on record.
« • *
If George Lohmann is the best all-round
cricketer in England, as alleged by fie British papers,
then George Giffen is easily champion of the world.
The English cricketing team is the finest field-
ing crowd which has ever visited Australia, but M'Gregor,
the much-trumpeted wicket-keeper, is inferior to Black-
ham and Jarvis. The latter is in wonderful form and
stood behind the wickets all day without a single sundry
being recorded, whilst 323 runs were made !
* * *
The Englishmen scored 16—of which Grace
hit 14— from the first two overs bowled against them on
the M.C.C. ground. That’s what W.G. means by “putting
more life into the game.” He and Abel scored 91 runs in
65 minutes.
* * »
That four o’clock adjournment for drinks will
disappear from big matches on the Melbourne Ground
henceforth and for ever. Grace put his bat down upon
the ancient practice and killed it.
# * #
Tom Garrett will have his first stand-down in
the match against the Englishmen. “Every dog has his
day ” and Mr. Garrett has had a longer day than most
men.
• * •
When Grace had scored 14 in the recent Mel-
bourne cricket match he was missed by Morris in the
slips. Every run after that made by W.G. must have been
like a stab in Morris’ side. That catch would have at least
saved a one-innings defeat.
• • *
It is stated that the reason why Mr. George
Seale, undoubtedly the champion amateur boxer of Aus-
tralia, never faces the music now, is that Minister Bruce
Smith assured him that should he fight in earnest any
more he would have to leave the N.S.W. Government
service.
• * *
Some of the papers talk about “Gentleman
George ” Dawson having been reinstated in his former
position as champion light-weight, by Williams’ neglect
to make another match. This may lie technically true,
but it is arrant nonsense all the same, as nobody doubts
that Williams could thump Dawson every time.
* * #
Should Jackson and Slavin really meet, Slavin
will win. Before Slavin left for England he said to an old
Brisbane patron : “ I will win or lose my fights in six or
eight rounds.” His longest fight up to now has been of
nine rounds; the others have been ail less than six.
Slavin is a grim fighter by nature. His soul rejoices in
the shock of biffs and uppercuts. His constitution would
enable him to endure three times the belting Jackson
could.
* * *
Sullivan has posted money for a match with
Slavin, to come off in September or October next. As
well might he fix it for the beginning of next century.
By the way, it does not appear to have struck anybody,
up to date, that Sullivan and Slavin are really the same
name, the latter being a mere corruption of the former,
as Moss is of Moses. Perhaps, however, J. L. Sullivan
will yet find that Patrick Francis’ name conies from Slay,
with a big S. We shouldn’t be surprised.
# * *
The Bulletin is now convinced that if Sullivan
is ever to be tackled, black Samuels, the fast sprinter, and
not Slavin is the man for the job.
# * *
Pugilistic circles have been much exercised over
the primi-facie shabby action of the Sydney Amateur
Gymnastic Club in giving Murphy £4O and Burge nil in
connection with the recent mill, which was declared “ no
fight.” The writer is under the impression that Burge
would only enter the ring under the condition that the
fight should be “ to a finish ” pure and simple, and he has
only himself to blame if he now does not receive any-
thing, for had the referee possessed the power to declare
in favour of one or (be other on “points” when he
thought the fight should he stopped, there is no knowing
that the “go ’• might have been awarded to Murphy, who
,lid all the fighting, and then Burge would have received
the loser’s portion of the purse.
* * *
It is asserted in a Victorian newspaper that the
person who drew Malvolio in TattcrsaH’s big sweep had
to part £9OOO to the owner of the Cup-winner !
The Sydney Amateur Gymnastic Club should
once and for all fix an amateur boxing status. '
sent aspirants for amateur honours, bar beaie ana
O’Donnell, are ironworkers and blacksmiths, almost to
man. _

The sixteenth interprovincial boat race, which
took place last Saturday on the Yarra, was a procession
of three, with Queensland three lengths ahead of A.o. vv.,
and Victoria toiling alone in the extreme rear. Possibly
there was too much massive beef in the hinder mats.
The Queensland crew is said to have averaged lOst. 3|ib.,
the Cornstalks list. 12£1b., and the Victorians list,
which seems a serious difference in bulk. Queensland
got ahead almost at the outset, rowed at a tremendous
bat all through, and was never overtaken At the ferry
the Northern men were one length ahead; at Spottiswoode
Point they were two lengths in front; and after that the
interest centred in the frantic struggle between N.h.v .
and Victoria for second place. N.S. Wales gained it by a
stupendous effort, and the Southerners came in with their
tail down at the very end. Time, 18min. 45sec.

Harry Grainger took ten wickets in two overs—only three

ball upset stumps. In another match, in which Grainger
bowled, the batters were all disposed of for four rues.

George Barrett, one of the three leading Eng-

angels seraphs, roosters, flowers, infants, rose-
buds and things of that description, and in all

Tales of the Old Regime.
No, XVII .—The Felicitous Reminiscences of
Scourger James.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Now God made man, but the devil made
the Convict Scourger. Either the devil or the
devil’s own son, the System’s Official.”
That was the substance of what Oibbety Joe
used to say, and Gibbety Joe had a right to
express an opinion on the point. For he had
received at the cat-ends several thousand lashes at
sundry times and in different places.
# * *
George Augustus Sala in his “Echoes of
the Week” published in the Melbourne Argus
and the New York Herald, said Joe’s tally was
7000. Which was a cruel libel on the Regime. It
is shameful to libel the dead, and when the dis-
tinguished London journalist exaggerated that
wherewith the men of Old Time had blessed
Gibbety, he wronged them scandalously. There
was no excuse for Sala—none in the least, doe’s
voice was not such a mumble that it did not ring
through the white-washed barn to No. 15 bed—
Joe’s was in No. 12, on the other side—and the
occupant of No. 15 heard Joe say, plain enough,
“ Six thousan’l ’ed, all told.” And if G.A.S.
put 7000 down in his note-book, he was inex-
cusably careless, for his carelessness led him to
commit the heinous offence of circulating the
statement that the total of Joe’s tally was the
greater number when he should have reported
what he had been told —the lesser. There are
some things that will not bear exaggeration, and
when the excess does injury to the reputations of
the dead, well, the affair is very bad.
“An’ ’twar wery wrong of him, sir,” whined
No. 15-bed, “to say wot war not true. An’
he’ll go down to hell of a surety, sir. I flicked
Joe his last hundred an’ fifty, sir, an’ I ought to'
know, for not to say naught of his tellin’ the man
hisself as he lay in that bed there —he was No. 12,
sir—not to say naught o’ that, as I. heard him my-
self, I had it from the Cora’dant. An’ he scorned
a lie like anythink, did Com’dant. An’ I say ’tis
a shame to slander us so —’twarn’t seven thousand,
’twas on’y six—’tis a shame, it is, a blarsted
shame.”
“James ! ” in grieved tones.
“ O mem, may God forgive me for a-swearin’,
but it makes my blood boil to hear the Systim
libulled ! ’Twarn’t seven thousand —’twar on’y
six !” And James James, occupant of No. 15
bed, in a Tasmanian Invalid Depot, squeezed out
some tear-like drops. One of his hearers thought
his moist grief was due to his shame at the
outrage on the System’s fame ; another, to his fear
that his oath had offended the former, a kindly,
conscientious lady-agent of the City Mission, and
that he would in consequence gain a bad mark,
and lose his hardly-earned repute for sanctity,
and the extra tobacco and dainties which his
saint-hood brought him. For James James was a
model convert —a very brand plucked from the
burning—and his conversion had been given
seventeen lines of small-pica in the Mission’s last
annual report. He, retired floggerand descendant
of the devil, was yet anxious to die in the odour
of holiness and genuine Barrett’s-twist, and now
here in his righteous indighatiort at the casting
by a scribbling globe-trotter of a disgraceful
imputation on the System which had been a solid
friend to him, lie had back-slidden into a warmth
of language quite unfitting a recent convert and
newly-born saint.
There can be no question, it was hard upon
him. Sala was inexcusably wrong in giving
way to a professional tendency to exaggera-
tion. There is only one thing to be said in
extenuation of his fault. He may have thought
that as matters went in the days of the Old
Regime there was precious little difference
between seven thousand lashes and six thousand.
Perhaps there was not. The man who had
received six might have been presented with the
additional thousand without doing him much
additional harm, always provided that the ten
hundred followed upon, say, three or four
hundred. After that preliminary dose the extra
lot would mean just another pint or two of blood
on the ground. Pew men felt pain after the four-
hundredth lash. If you want to know why, ask
the nearest doctor.
# * *
That James James, per ship Hercules,
having drawn upon the vocabulary of his unre-
generate days should suffer, \yas right and proper,
and therefore we went away and left him to be
prayed with by the City Mission lady. But in
two hours’ time we went back to his bedside and
upon the coverlet we spread six figs of tobacco, a
new briar-wood pipe, a pot of jam, and three
ounces of jujubes. No child has a sweeter tooth
than an old transport who has only two or three
teeth left in his gums.
“ These are yours, James .”
“ Oh, thank yer, sir ! May God bless .”
“None o’ that, my friend. I’m not connected
with the City Mission. They are yours on one
condition.”
“Yes, sir—oh, yes, sir!”
“That you get up and act the scourger—not
merely tell me of your doings as a scourger, but
act them ! Do you understand !”
The jaws of No. 15’s neighbours fell open wider
and their wrinkles multiplied with ghostly laugh-
ter. James’ predicament was as the savour of a
Sunday dinner -to his neighbours. Like most
saints, who are also hypocrites, he was heartily
detested by those who saw most of him. There-
fore, they waited, amused, for the reply they knew
would come.
“But I can’t, sir. I’m bed-ridden wi’ the
r’eumatiz ! I can’t act a scourger !”
“Rheumatism is bad, James, but there’s a
worse thing than rheumatism, James. And that
is hell, James —and liars go to hell, don’t they,
James?”
“ Ye-e-s, sir!”
“Now, James, I’m not a City Missionary, and
therefore you won’t get anything by telling lies to
me. You’re not bed-ridden, James, for all your
78 years—l’ve been looking up your record, you
see—and you’ll get up and show me how you
swung the cats or you don’t touch any of those
good things.”
He moved as if to rise, and then stopped.
“Wot if the Super, came, sir?” he whispered.
“ He thinks I’m very bad.”
“ You’re afraid of your special ration, James ?”
“That’s it, sir ! I’m an invalid on speshal.”
The wretch winked.
‘ ‘ And you think you have taken in the Super.
Why, he told me you were shamming rheu-
matism
“ Did he, sir ? An’ yet he keeps me on speshal
diet! Well !”
“ Yes, he does. It’s rather surprising, but he
does it for a gpod reason. He says you’re so sure
of a bad time hereafter in spite of your conversion
that he wants to make your last days here pretty
comfortable. So you see there is no use pretending
any more. Get up and show me how you used the
cats- ”
The old sinner was out of bed before the sen-
tence was completed, and as he dressed begged for
a jujube. “Jest one, sir! On'y one whiles I
thinks of wot to say.”
The onlookers caught one glimpse of his back.
Evidently he himself had been under punishment,
but equally certain was it that his scourger had
been a duffer. There were no cicatrices of long
weals ; only twenty or so dots were depressed on
the outer-skin, and told that the cats had gathered
unto themselves “ bits ” and no more than “ bits.”
Some of his neighbours sighed as they noted the
scarcely-roughened surface. The Fates were not
always so kind to their malignant instruments.
“You’re lookin’ at my back, fellows ! ” grinned
James. “ A’most a clear skin, ain’t it? ”
“ That’s your shame, James,” in a passionful
shout, exclaimed another invalid. “ There was
no ’souse, was there, chaps, for a man to take
scourger’s billet unless he was a-driven to it by
th’ System ? ”
The paupers growled an ominous assent and
James looked uncomfortably for a moment. Then
he made a clutch at some more jujubes that were
offered him, and put the nasty thought out of
mental sight as to what his bed-neighbours would
say when the stranger had gone and the wards-
man’s back was turned. Even seventy —and
eighty—year olds, when they spent their youth
under the tuition of the Old Regime, retain be-
neath the placid exterior the power to vent the
Baresark rage. And as it is not good for a soldier
to rejoin his regiment when his wounds are in the
rear, so it was bad for a retired scourger to show
a “clear” back. With a “clear” skin, why was
he flogger? That was a question some of his
fellow-paupers meant to ask him by-and-bye.
# # #
“It was at the Harbour that I w r as promoted
to scourger, sir—in ’2B or ’29—an’ I was a younker
—twenty or so—l misremember exactly, an’ I
took the billet to save ray own skin.”
Here his brother-relics growled in a threatening
under-voice, “We knowed it—-we knowed it!”
“To save my own skin —an’ ye’d ha’all done
the same, for ’twar a double-cat, war the Harbour
cat, an’ I war a weak younker, an’ wot little flesh
I had I wanted to keep a-stickin’ on my bones.
Flesh is better on your bones than on the ground.
An’ ’tain’t sweet to see a patch o’ red dampness on
the soil, an’ know as it’s your wine.
“It war a double-cat—the rogues’ cat—nine
tails on’y, but nine knots ’stead o’ three on each
tail, an’ each tail war wot the croaker called a
bi-fold or a tri-fold —the whipcord war twist twice
or thrice. An’ the cracker of each tail war some-
times a wire point the length of a pin, may be, an’
sometimes a bit o’ cord stiffened with glue an’
salt. Mostly the cracker war the bit o’ cord, for
it took a smarty to fix the wire so it shouldn’t
drop out, an’ some scourgers never could. I never
could, master, an’ yer people an’ Confidants ha’
thought me a bit of a dab in my time.”
“So you couldn’t fix the wire? That was un-
fortunate !”
“Rather, sir, for if I’d been able to do that, I
wouldn’t ha’ got into trouble with the men at the
Harbour. ’Twar this way : I war a-handlin’ a
cat one day when I saw as the wire tips were
a-givin’. Now, ’twar no use stoppin’—the man’s
dose was on’y forty-nine.”—
“ Forty-nine? Was that to save the trouble of
calling the doctor?”
“ Yer hit it, sir ! Fifty ’ud been ’bliged to call
an’ so ’twas made one less—to save him trouble,
sir. So ’twarn’t, I say, no use stoppin’, an’—an’—
the bit o’ wire dropped orf—on the ground, I
thought. An’, of course, it didn’t matter.”
“ Not in the least, of course.”
“ On’y, when the pris’ner went into hospital,
he didn’t get better ’soon’s he should, an’ then he
got po’rish, an’ an abscess come along, an’ the
croaker couldn’t cure him, though, p’r’ups, as he
war on’y a pris’ner, he didn’t try wery hard. An’
when he died, for die he did, although it war on’y
forty-nine, the croaker opened him—for skientific
pupposes, sir, he ses—an’ the wire war in a wital
part. That made th’ chaps blow on me. Though
how I was to blame, I never see. No one war to
blame, on’y the System, for a-usin’ cats with wire-
crackers.
“No one war to blame. An’ the crawler died.’’
* x # »
“So when they ‘blew’ upon you, I sup-
pose the Commandant sent you to Hobart Town? ’
“ Yes, sir, ’tvvas in ’2!) I went up, by the old
Waterloo. An’ in ’32 I was sent to the new settle-
ment at Port Arthur, under Rossell. Ye’ve heard
of Rossell —him as flogged his own bastard boy to
death ? # —but I had no hand in that. An’ there
I grew more an’ more of a dab. I larnt to cross-
cut there. So !”
The Super., for experiment, had lent us an
ancient five-tailed scourge—one of the pattern
invented by Ernest Augustus Slyde, godson of
the Duke of Cumberland, sometime Police Magis-
trate of Sydney, and distinguished scoundrelf—
and this pretty toy James James cuddled lovingly
before he combed out the tails.
“So!” he sail. “So!” He disobeyed the"
apostolic precept and beat the air—artistically.
“ Yer begin quick, sir, an’ light—so! An’y’r
slow down as you get heavier—y’ know it hurts
’em the more the slower the blows. An’ you lets
the cuts fall on the shoulders first, an’ then come
lower an’ lower. An’ at the tally, if you’re a
cross-cutter, y’ change hands if you’re strong in
the left arm, and if you ain't, why you on’y turn
your wrist. It’s purtier, sir, to cross ’em with the
wrist on’y—purtier an’ nicer, ’cos almost anybody
can cross the cuts if y’ take both hands to it, but
to use on’y one hand fust one way, an’ then t’other
that’s reel difficult.”
“ Ah, you’d the makings of a great artist in
you, James, hadn’t you ? It’s only the great
artist who aspires after excellence that attempts
the difficult.”
“ I don’t quite follow you, sir, but that’s wot
Cap’n Rous—l hearn tell he became Admiral
arter, him as war a great-racin’ man—funny,
warn’t it, he should be so fond of the bosses, an’
him nothink but a sailor—”
“ Well, what did he say ?”
“ I war an artist, sir—a reel artist!”
“Why, how was that? What had Captain
Rous to do with you ?”
“It war this way. His ship, the —the—”
Recollection failed him for a moment, and so his
interlocutor thought he would assist him—into a
trap. The one almost certain method of detect-
ing whether an ex-convict is lying or not in a
narration of old-times, is to suggest at the first
lacuna in his story some imaginary name or date
or incident, and if the fellow is a liar, he will in-
stantly adopt the suggested “fact.” The dodge,
if not quite moral, is efficacious. It was tried on
this occasion.
“ Yes, let’s see what was his ship ? The Erebus,
wasn’t it ? ” Now the Erebus was Ross’s ship.

“ No,’twarn’t the Erebus. That
an’ she was in company with the Terror ? ”
“ The Beagle—was it the Beagle? ”
“No —’twarn’t the Beagle. Drat it, now, wot
war it?”
“ The Rainbow ?”
The felloW s eyes lit up with a gleam that went
bail for his veracity. “ The Rainbow ’twar, you re
right, sir.”
“ Well, get on with your story. What had you
to do with the Rainbow ? ’
“ VVe had just dropped anchor in the Cove the
Waterloo, I mean —an’ the Rainbow war on’y a
couple of cables’length from us, an’ she hailed our
skipper to send two scourgers on board. Me an
’nuther war sent orf.”
“ What did a King’s ship want with doggers
when she’d her boatswain’s mates ?”
“We wondered at that, an’ when we got on
board we soon knew. Captain Rous had, sure as
I’m here, sir, made up his min’ to flog the w’ole
ship’s company, petty-orf’cers an’ all. When the
ship sailed into the Derwent there ought to ha
been a relief crew an’ transport there, for the
Rainbow war to stop on the station herself. An
there war no relief crew an’ no transport, an’ the
crew was as rusty as this here cat. An’ the
bosen’s mates, nor the bosen, nor the marine, ’ud
lift a whip, an’ that’s the reason we war sent for.
An’ we guv’em all a dozen a-piece, and the war-
runt-officers two dozen, and the bosen’s mates
three dozen, for they war ’tickerly rebelyas, Cap’n
Rous said. But the bosen’s mates were put on
the gratin’s last, an’ they got orf lightest arter
all! ”
“ How was that? Were you tired?”
“ Scarcely a bit when ’twas all oyer ! That
’twasn’t the reason. It was the slip’riness of the
decks —we couldn’t stand at the last. It’s not in
natur’, sir, as two-hunderd men could get them
lashes, an’not leave traces. Not that all spurted
jooce ! ” He stopped —to laugh.
“ What was the naval cat like? It was different
from this ? ”
“ Oh, lor, yes ! Three feet o’ rope tarred an
resined—eighteen inch rove an’ boun’ round
with sail-thread, an’ ’t’other eighteen inch in six
tails sometimes, an’ sometimes nine, with three
knots on each tail. It war the easiest to use
long way nicer than the Settlement cat the
Harbour cat. And when I’d done on the Rain-
bow an’ got my glass of grog, an’ Cap’n Rous’d
told me I war an artist —lor! sir, how he larfed
as he said it! —I arxed his Honor for the cat, an’
he guv it me, quite pleasunt-likean’ gen’el’manly.
An’ I kep’ it for a long time, an’ used it at Port
Arthur once or twice till Capt’n Boote— him as
followed Dr. Rossell, sir—said as its use war quite
illegal, ’cos it war more distructive than our cat —
‘it war ’tensifyin’ punishmunt beyond the demands
of justice ’ —them war his wery words, sir—’cos a
dozen with a man-o’-war’s cat war ekal to fifty
with ours, an’ fifty with the man-o’-war cut a man
up more’n two hundred of System’s floggin’.'’
“Well, that was genuinely kind of Captain
Boote !”
“ That’s as it may be. Wait till ye hear all.
“It war Monday. Com’dant Rossell used to
flog most o’ Sunday, but Boote was more religious
—‘it didn’t give a chap, who was at the triangles
at eight o’clock, much chance of attendin’church
at ten in a good frame o’ mind ’ —them are his
words agen, sir—an’ so he made Monday his
princ’pal floggin’ day, an’ John Price, sir, he liked
Monday best, too, scourgers war flasher, he used
to say, after Sunday’s rest but there, I’m
ramblin’—wot war I goin’ to say ?”
“About Boote prohibiting the use of the naval
cat as illegal ?”
“Ah, that war it! Well, one Monday I’d
flogged a man with the man-o’-war tool, an’ as
he’d been some’ut of a chum o’ mine, I warn’t as
heavy as might ha’ been. That’s one ’vantage
of the man-o’-war cat. Being shorter in the handle
an’ length o’ tail, yer stand in closer, an’ if
yer like can dodge the orf’cer’s eyes as is
watchin’yer. Catch the tails so” —he gathered
up the tails of the thing he held in his hand at
the root, where they sprang from the heft—“an’
you on’y let the ends catch on the man. That
war wot I’d did that mornin’, an’ tho’ the fellow’d
suffered some’ut, yet still ’twarn’t much of a
floggin’, I’ll admit. Now Boote was a-standin’
aside, an’ could see better’n the chief-constable
who was taliyin’, an’ he said when last tally was
called, the “ use of that cat ain’t legul, Scourger ;
it’s more distructive than our cat —it’s tensifyin’
pun’shment, that’s wot ’tis—no, I can't ’low it!”
An’ then, ’cos the ship’s cat was illegal, what d’ye
think he made me do, to krect the illegul’ty ? ”
“ Can’t say, am sure ! ”
“ He made me guv the pris’ner his dose of fifty
over agen with the Settlement-cat. That’s wot he
called ‘ krecting the illegul’ty.’ He was a stickler
for doin’ things in order was Cap’n Boote. ’Cos
the first lot warn’t legul, he guv ’im the second.”
# * *
“ Now, what about Gibbety Joe ? You
gave him, you say, his last hundred and fifty?
What was that for, and why was he called Gib-
bety ?"’
“It war in the ’4B, sir, an’ things war a-gettin’
moral-like —not so hard for the pris’ners an’
Gov’mnnt labour. But I war still offi’shal scourger
an’ doin’ well, busy or not busy. Two-an’-six a
day an’ a double rashun warn't to be sneezed at.
“Well, I war flogger at Cam’eltown. An’one
fine day, a court day, who should come along for
pun’shmunt but Gibbety Joe. He war named
Gibbety Joe ’cos he war the last man sentenced to
bo gibbetted on Hunter’s Island —the ol’ wharf at
Hobart Town runs out to the Island, sir, for ’taint
an island no longer—it’s filled in .”
“I know all about it. Go on! Why was he
sentenced, and why was he reprieved ?”
“He war sentenced for doin’ (killing) his man,
an’ he war ’preeved ’cos he war Gov’munt cox’n,
an’ no finer boat hand war ’vailable. But ’preevin’
him didn’t do him no manner of good, for he war
always in trouble —he war so high-spirited an’
such a tongue I never seed in all my born days.
He never paid no respeck to pussons, as Cat’chism
ses, an’ he war rude all round.
“Well, upCam’eltown-way, he’d been assigned.
He ought to ha’ had freedom long afore, but from
a-bein’ in trouble always, he had piled up more
sentence’n all other hands on the place put
together. It ’ud have taken eight or nine
ord’nary Gov’ment men to sarve his times.”
“ Was he a violent customer?”
“ No, never; never struck a blow arter the first
one which killed his man. But sech a tongue !
He gave nobody rest with it. An’ ’twar for
makin’ free with his master, a-tellin’ him that had
every one their own, their posishuns ’ud ha’ been
reversed, that he was in for the pun’shmunt as I
guv him.
“ One - hundred - an’ • fifty in quarter - minute
strokes ”
“ What/” Forty minutes, while the strokes
should not have taken more than three, was
punishment worthy of the Inquisition.
“Oh, I’m speakin’ true, sir! Forty mmuteSj
an’ a rest betwixt each cut.
“ I cuts him high—so! An’ I cuts him low —
so ! An’ then I was bid to cut him on his legs.
He was all raw (fresh) on the legs, but ’twarn’t
that wot made him yell.”
“He yelled? I shouldn’t have thought he was
the fellow to yell ? ”
“That war his dodge—that's why he hadn’t
died long afore from his hoggin’s. It war ’cos he
knew that th’ cove who cried an’ yelled out didn’t
feel so much as the fellow who played game an’
bold—the croakers used to say that the strain on
the nerves to keepin’ the mouth shut were nearly
fatal—an’ not that he war a coward that he yelled.
He war no coward ! He’d took his five'thousand-
eight-fifty an’ lived 1 That warn’t a coward’s
work.
“ Well, he yelled, an’ yelled. Bub when last
tally war called,' he stops the yellin’ an’
shouted ”
“Domino! Domino! Was it Domino? ”
James’s pauper-hearers had been listening
breathlessly to the recital, and it was from between
their sunken lips that the cry had come. The
Valhalla of convict mythology was populated with
the men who cried “ Domino !” after flogging. It
was the hero’s stamp.
* * *
“ Yes, ’twar ‘Domino !’ But ’twarn’t all.
Arter I’d cast him loose he flung his shirt over his
shoulder, an’, marchin’ past the Police-Magistrate
who’d stopped to watch pun’shmunt, Joe snapped
his fingers in his face and cried, as bold as brass :
‘ There, that’s how much I think of your floggings,
old shaver !’ ”
“Hooray, hooray!” The white-washed barns
echoed to the phantom-cheer which gasped through
toothless gums. James seized the opportunity to
extract the sweetness from another jujube. Then
he went on to his conclusion.
“But for all his pluck, that Hoggin’broke his
heart an’ spirit. He’d turned to the cells, when
he looked up, an’ saw standin’ in the gateway of
the yard two ladies —the Magistrate’s lady an’
anuther. They’d been lookin’ on.
“Joe saw them —stared —turned grave-cloth
white —an’ ses : ‘ Good God ! them wimmen
heard me a-yellin’, an’ they must ha’_ thought as I
was a crawler !’ His head fell on his breast, an
as ’twar, sir, he never lifted it no more. He
couldn’t a-bear to be thought a coward by wimmen,
an’, o’ course, the wimmen didn’t know as he
warn’t no coward. An’ his pride war hurt. The
’Thorities never had no more trouble with him
arter that—he lived forty year arter, but he war
always sick. He had no more pluck, an’ no more
spirit. An’ he didn’t get no consolashun from the
fac’ as he owned the record for the colony, sir.
No one topped his six thousan’ —none. + An’ now,
sir, can I have the pipe an’ baccy ? ”

For his reward he had them —and some-
thing else. Thoughtlessly, when we went out
of the Invalid Ward, we left behind us the
cat the Super, had lent us for the experiment.

“ I had occasion,” writes “ Pentecost ” in
Twentieth Century, “tospend last Sunday week
in Toronto, Canada, and to see how quiet a city
of two hundred thousand inhabitants can be made
by religious rule. Not a horse-car is allowed to
run. Not a store or shop of any kind is allowed
to be open. Not a newspaper is allowed to be
printed. Only one railroad train is allowed to
pass through the town. Not a postage-stamp, or
cigar, or glass of sodawater can be bought. Few
persons are seen on the streets, except in going to
and from church. On Sunday the city appears
deserted of inhabitants. If one is poor, no oppor-
tunities for pleasure to be had. If one is rich,
however, he may drive about in a carriage,
or if a guest at a hotel ho may order
drinks to his room. Religions rule has
made Sunday a terror to the poor, unless one
happens to enjoy going to church, walking about
the quiet streets, reading or sleeping. There are
104 churches in the city, all untaxed. There are
but 106 churches in New York, with two million
and a quarter inhabitants. Clergymen and lay
churchmen rule Toronto and keep it as lifeless as
a log. There are 13 wards in the city, every one
of which is named after a saint. Happily, I was
able to get back to Buffalo before the dismal Sab-
bath was over. There, in a hotel, I found an
orchestra discoursing the sweetest secular music-
waltzes, gavottes, boleros, melodies —while the
guests were dining. The contrast was deliciously
in favour of the States as against priest-ridden
Canada.
THE DOCTORS SHOOK THEIR HEADS.
“ I would give a million dollars for a stomach,”
said a wealthy American recently. Now, a
million dollars (£200,000) is a deal of money, but he
was not able to buy the article even at that price.
Mr. Thomas Gaskin, of No. 3, Poplar Row,
Darley Abbey, near Derby, is not so rich as many,
being a gardener, but he was ready enough to give
all he had for one thing he hadn’t got. Here is
his story, and he shall tell it in his own way. Mr.
Gaskin goes on to say : “Up to eight years ago I
had never lost an hour’s work through sickness.
In December, 1882, whilst living at Beeston, near
Nottingham, my appetite fell away, I had dread-
ful pain after eating, a bad taste in my mouth,
which would fill with water and slime, the latter
so thick and sticky that I often had to remove it
with my fingers. My chest used to ‘ fill up ’ and
my throat would swell so I couldn’t button my
shirt at the neck. I vomited a great deal,
chiefly a yellowish-green phlegm. I had a racking
cough, and would cough and strain till I bled at
the nose, and the blood rushed out of my ears. I
became exhausted and short of breath and had to
call the doctor, and was in bed five or six weeks.
“I then went as out-patient to the Nottingham
Hospital, and after attending there for six months
was very little better. I got so thin that I was
like a ghost walking about, and my friends said it
was all up with me. For eighteen months I kept
getting better, then worse, and at last the doctors
recommended me to try a change of air. So I
came to Darley Abbey and my former master gave
me an indoor recommendation to the Derbyshire
Infirmary, Derby. I found, however, that all the
beds in the hospital were full, and I saw my club
doctor and also two doctors at Derby. The first
one said, ‘ You are in a galloping consumption, and
must die ; ’ the other doctors, after sounding my
lungs and chest, said nothing, but shook their heads.
“Getting a trifle better my old master allowed
me to do what little I could in his gardens and
grounds; and some days I worked a little, and
then would be away for a few days. Things went
on like this until December, 1888, when I caught
cold, got very short of breath, and broke down
completely, I was always coughing and spitting
up phlegm, sometimes as much as a teacupful at
once, and was afraid to go to sleep for fear the
phlegm ivould choke me. At this time the whites
of my eyes turned yellow, and my eyes were
bloodshot. My lips and mouth were dry and
parched and I often broke out into a cold, clammy
sweat. My tongue was like a piece of brown
leather, and I could keep nothing down. I lost
over a stone weight in three weeks.
“ I managed to get up for a few hours at a time,
but was so weak I had to take hold of the
furniture to move a few yards. I was always
tired and weary, and sitting or lying, was never
at ease and got no real rest. Too weak to read I
often sat for hours looking at my hands—nothing
but skin and bone, and was so nervous I couldn’t
bear the least noise, and the children at play quite
upset me.
“ The doctor kept on attending me, but he said,
* I can do you no good ; I can only patch you up,
because your lungs are diseased.' I then gave over
taking his medicine and tried everything I could
hear of. One thing was a cough cure from London
that cost 225. a bottle. But nothing did any good,
and my friends who came to see me said, ‘ Well,
you won't cough much longer, you have merely to
pt'eparefor another world.'
“ About the middle of March, 1889, a neighbour
named Joseph Tatham, who works in the paper
mills at Darley Abbey, said to me, ‘ Tom, did you
ever try Mother Seigel's Syrup ?’ and told me how
he had been cured after being in the hospital. He
spoke so much in praise of this medicine I sent
my wife to Derby and got a bottle at Mr. Smith’s
Stores in Victoria Street. After the first dose I
had an evacuation black as ink, and vomited.
Then I fell asleep and felt rested when I awoke.
After taking the medicine for three days my
breathing got easier, my food kept down, and in a
few days more I was able to go out for a short
walk. By the end of a fortnight I went to see my
master, who asked what had wrought the
improvement, and I told him, as I tell every one,
that Mother Seigel’s Syrup had saved my life. I
commenced work at once, and have never lost a
day’s work since.
“ Of course my strength did not return all at
once, but after taking Seigel’s Syrup for six
months I was strong as ever in my life and have
continued so ever since.”
In giving his consent to the publication of this
remarkable statement, Mr. Gaskin requests us to
refer all doubters to him or to Mr. Keetley, Head
Gardener, Darley Abbey, who is acquainted with
all the facts alleged. Mr, Gaskin has lived at
Darley Abbey 22 years and bears an excellent
reputation.
Now, what was the complaint from which he
suffered ? Not galloping consumption, certainly
(as one of the doctors thought), or he would have
galloped into his grave in less than three months ,
instead>of growing worse for seven years. His
complaint Was chronic inflammatory dyspepsia
(or chronic gastric catarrh), which has lung
symptoms like consumption, for which it is so
often ignorantly mistaken and wrongly treated.
When the right remedy, Mother Seigel’s Syrup,
was used the disease yielded, as all diseases of the
digestive tract do yield to that magnificent pre-
paration. We heartily congratulate Mr. Gaskin
on his recovery, and commend the facts of his
case to all thinking people.

Writes a correspondent : —In Nicholas v.
Howells, the biggest equity case ever heard in
Tasmania, Henry Dobson has briefed himself and
two other counsel for plaintiff. His opening ad-
dress occupied three days and a half. Though
admitted to practice as a barrister and solicitor 27
years ago, and though senior partner in the largest
Hobart firm, this is his first appearance. As he
entered Parliament about four months ago, and
now leads the Opposition, it is currently believed
that he is testing his capabilities for the Attorney-
Generalship. By the way, this is the case for
appearance in which Goldsmith, of Melbourne, is
retained by some of the defendants at <£40 a day.
The case has already occupied eight days and
defendant’s case has not begun.

Had the original programme of official

friend of Meyer’s, a well-known pressman,
formerly attached to the Age, was to have got a
billet as working secretary, and to have joined
Oscar in Chicago.
A N S.W, up-country editor thus am-
biguously refers to the proprietor of the opposition

Gladstone’s recent visit to Newcastlc-on-
Tyne and his prediction that the Liberals will win
hands-down at the next general election, recalls
his other prophecy delivered at Newcastle during
the American civil war. “ We may expect with
certainty,” said Gladstone, —
The success of the Southern States as far as regards
effecting their separation from the North. I, for my part,
cannot but believe that that event is as certain as anything
future and contingent may be.
“ As Mr. Gladstone had before publicly and
exultingly stated that Mr. Jefferson Davis ‘ had
made an army, had made a navy, and had made a
nation,’possibly, in his confident prediction, the
wish was father to the thought,” remarks an
English paper.

Jonathan Hutchinson, the great medical
specialist, in narrating his personal experience
concerning alcohol and tea, lately said that beer
made his boots too tight and tea made them too
large, causing contraction of the blood-vessels
both of the feet and of the head, just as beer
caused dilatation. He held that there was no
reason to believe, in spite of the showy statistics
of some insurance offices, that teetotallers attained
greater longevity, or enjoyed their lives better,
than those who took alcohol in moderate quanti-
ties. Of course, the difficulty is to know how
much is a “moderate quantity.”
