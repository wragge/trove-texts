EVERYTHING . . , SO SMOKERS SAY. ..
WHEN THE NAME IS “MARCOVITCH”
The name of Marcovitch has been renowned among smokers since 1834.
It has been throughout these years symbolical, a standard of smoking
elegance. Today, more than ever before, a vast army of connoisseurs are
finding delight in a famous Marcovitch Cigarette Black & White. It is
all that the name Marcovitch implies perfeciion in smoking.
Such wonderful traditions as surround the House of Marcovitch impose
great obligations—and Black & While Cigarettes amply fulfil them. Those
obligations are, to use only the costliest, most mellow Virginian tobaccos;
to skilfully blend them according to the Marcovitch “Private Process”;
and to roll each Black & White Cigarette in the purest and finest of
papers. Because of these quality standards Black & White Cigarettes are
welcome and smoked throughout the world.
What’s in a name? Everything! The name Marcovitch signifies quality
perfection satisfaction!

Queensland is a vast State to cover, with many minor publications
dotted over its length and breadth; but there are two outstanding
advertising mediums upon which you can base your 1935
campaign with certainty of success.
THE COURIER-MAIL
62,617 Copies Daiiy
(A.B.C. Certificate for 6 months to Sept. 30, 1934.)
Queensland’s outstanding daily newspaper with, by far, the largest
circulation of any newspaper published in the State.
THE SUNDAY MAIL
47,205 Copies Per Issue
(A.B.C. Certificate for 6 months ended Sept. 30, 1934.)
Companion Journal to the Courier-Mail, anti showing a more pheno-
menal increase in circulation than any newspaper in Australia. A
comparison of the monthly net averages from April to September with
its previous A.B.C. Certificate of 40,343 copies per issue should _ prove
to national advertisers that it is worthy of inclusion in any campaign:
NET AVERAGE CIRCULATION PER ISSUE.

The Week’s Best:—
ON MEN
WITHOUT ART
Wyndham
Lewis, as great a
satirist as to-
day, has written
in defence of satire and in praise o£
satirists, including Wyndham Lewis.
The title, followed by a list of Great
Names, is misleading: “Men Without
Art: with chapters on Ernest Hemingway,
Virginia Woolf, Wyndham Lewis, Gustave
Flaubert, William Faulkner, T. S. Eliot,
Henry James.” It is hardly at all the pur-
pose of Mr, Lewis to demonstrate that
any of these is without art. “This book
has, in fact, been written, to put it
shortly, to defend Satire. But to Satire
I have given a meaning so wide as to
confound it with Art... .That there is
some occasion to defend art, at the
moment at which I write,
is pretty generally con-
ceded. Indeed, a society
of Men Without Art is
not a mere dream of the
future, but a matter of
practical politics—many
politicians and theqlo-
logians envisage such a
possibility with the most
unruffled calm, if not
with relish.
“For all practical pur-
poses, then, we may de-
scribe this book as a
defence of contemporary
art, most of which art is
unquestionably satiric, or
comic. And it is a de-
fence against every sort
of antagonist, from that
deep-dyed Moralist, the
public of Anglo-Saxony,
down to that nationalist
nuisance, which would
confine art to some terri-
torial or racial tradition; from the
Marxist who would harness art to poli-
tics, up to the mystical dogmatism which
would harness it to the vapors of the
spirit-world.”
Later in the book he again deals with
the purpose: “ it is sought to-day
arbitrarily to limit its [art’s] function
And, in order to maintain itself in inde-
pendence, upon the same footing as
Wyndham Lewis, self-portrait
(or personal appearance satire).
science, it must combat interference as
never before: hence this book, of
course.” And, having dealt with the
manner in which what Gasset calls “the
revolt of the masses” is interfering with
the old independence of art, he leaves
the problem to the brains of the reader,
hoping that he may have “directed your
attention to a question of great moment,
namely, whether the society of the imme-
diate future should be composed, for the
first time in civilised history, of Men
Without Art.”
Underlying this general theme there is
incisive criticism, some of it damning,
though most of it friendly, of those Great
Names mentioned on the jacket. He is
particularly severe on Faulkner. The
superb detachment of Faulkner, the cer-
tainty with which he has set down the
American Southern States’ scene, the stir-
ring comedy—and satire, amazingly
enough—of such things as the story
“Death Drag,” Mr. Lewis passes over. To
Faulkner he discredits this sort of pain-
ful monotony —characteristic enough, in
heaven’s name!
From Sartoris : —
p. 41. “a thin sourceless odor of locust
drifted up.”
p. 48. “the room was
filled now with a gray
light, sourceless and
chill.”
p. 145. “Moon and
insects were one
dimensionless and with-
out source.”
So on, with enough
examples to demonstrate
that Faulkner might be
helped if he or his pub-
lishers employed a sym-
pathetic sub-editor. Mr,
Lewis himself is more in
need of one. He dances
round the terminological
mulberry-bush in a most
clumsy fashion. This
sort of thing:
p. 7. “an advance illus-
tration, as it were.”
p 7. “By this means,
at all events.”
p.B. “The above is
however.”
pB. “which are
written, of course.”
p.lO. ‘‘This book has,
in fact, been written, to
put it shortly.”
p.lO. “So this book may be said to ,be.”
p. 17. “but he is considerably older, I
believe.”
p. 17. “not the best way, I am afraid.”
p. 17. “This dissection is, however.”
p. 17. “And indeed.”
p.lB. “I do not suppose.”
p.lB. “though I dare say.”
p.lB. “is quite likely.”
p.lB. “I expect.”
p.lB. “I am sure.”
p.lB. “but it is, I think.”
That ought to be enough, I think, to
illustrate, perhaps, the manner in which
Mr. Lewis, Who is, at any rate, or so
it seems to me, at least what might be
called a contemporary master, if that
is the right word, in the use of living
English, as distinct —shall we say?- —from
what might possibly be termed, in a
sense, dead English—that is to say, the
flabby or, as it might be put, the wishy-
washy sort of writing familiar, surely, to
most of us, unless we have been for-
tunate, which, indeed, is unlikely, does,
as it were, to put it shortly, throw child-
ish qualifications about to the detriment,
I am afraid,
of what, I
dare say, is, I
expect, quite
ikely, I do be 1
ieve, a bril-
liant work of
literary criti-
cism.
Anyone
who feels that
that, or the
extracts
given, are
unjust to Mr.
Lewis should
turn to the
c h a pter on
T. S. Eliot
and carefully
mark all
examples of that sort of wretched writ-
ing. It has not been drawn on for this
review: even including the leading
articles of newspapers it is as bad a thing
of the kind as has ever been done.
A refreshing, a curious book, strong
enough where it is strong to give a new
lead to thought in literary criticism.
Hans Fallada, of the new
sentimentalists.
A NOVEL,
SOMEWHAT
COARSE
Among the
critical statements
which Wyndham
Lewis makes—
there is one of
about the same
weight to every page—is that he does not
see how situations of this present day of
Peace can, any more than War situa-
tions, be treated in fiction, or in drama,
or in anything else, without some degree
of coarseness. “It is only by ‘coarse-
ness’ that we can paint our picture truly.
As with the War-novel, so (only more
so) with the Peace-novel (if it is to be
the genuine article), a good measure of
coarseness must be allowed.”
He should be satisfied with the latest
work of that writer who, presented on
the screen, has lately been stirring up
such a thick gush of sentimentalism—
the German Hans Fallada. The novel,
Who Once Eats Out of the Tin Bowl,
is a determined attempt to present am
aspect of the contemporary German
scene, the low-life (and about as low as
has been depicted) in just those terms
which Mr. Lewis finds necessary. To
say that had it been done by an Aus-
tralian it would have been banned here
on any ten of its pages hardly describes
its particular degree of coarseness, and
does not begin to say that it is a bad
book (that is hard saying, but a country
which bans, and keeps banned, a chilly
satire like Brave New World cannot be
spoken of too contemptuously). But the
coarseness of Fallada’s latest book even
a lavatory author would hardly dispute.
It is laid on with a shovel. Yet the novel
is, as all who use their eyes and know
anything about low life will agree, a
sincere piece of work, and that is some-
thing in a time when so much is evasive
and hypocritical.
It is, of course, grievously sentimental:
its author is an arrant sentimentalist, of
the new school of those gentry: instead
of sentimentalising Lady Gwendoline and
Lord Caphoops, he sentimentalises the
low, the criminal, the furtive, the prefer-
ably-unwashed.
(The “tin bowl” is the prison eating
utensil. Who “once eats out of” it has
a hard time when he comes out, and,
more often than not, goes back to
eat again. That is the whole of the
story.)
Fallada does this sort of sentimental-
ism well: he does it so well that it passes
current for great realism. The work is
selected here as an extraordinarily inter-
esting example of this new sentimental-
ism carried to about its highest (or
lowest) degree. It is symptomatic—even
more so than was Little Man, What
Now? —of the power to attract atten-
tion to themselves of the contemporary
masses, “masses” being used not in the
political sense, but in that of Gasset, to
represent the average poor creature of
no intelligence and not much more than
animal feeling.

On the other hand, we get much irrele-
vant information about the biographer
—that he is “among the radical thinkers
of the nineteenth-twentieth century, that
he “comes of Southern Protestant stock
on the paternal side” yet is “very Irish
—more Irish than the Irish themselves,
that he went to school in Sydney with
Roderick Quinn, dedicated a travel-book
to one of his masters, etc.
Words are used in the wrong sense
(“reclame,” which means something like
ballyhoo, for fame ; “amenities” for the
bitternesses of Ireland’s “aching centuries
filled with sorrow”); and the style is
highfalutin.

He deals in this strain with the Conscrip-
tion campaign, the Easter rebellion, the
Archbishop’s trip through America, his
internment in England by Lloyd George
and his return to Australia, the pilgrim-
age to Rome in 1925 and the chief events
of his subsequent career up to the middle
of last year.
A biography of the Archbishop written
objectively, and with knowledge of the
early surroundings and influences which
helped to turn an Irish lad into a world
figure, would be of interest and value to
modern students and future historians.
This is a panegyric, and a hurried one at
that. Take away the author’s remarks
about himself and his flowery tributes
to Erin and his subject, and there would
be hardly anything left.
H. S.
Something
New Under
the Sun
The genius who
remarked that
there is nothing
new under the
sun is open to
adverse criticism
on at least one obvious exception to his
dictum —the continual and necessary in-
vention of new words and of new mean-
ings to old words. What would that
gentleman have replied had he been
asked whether technocracy was a menace
to the Ogpu or whether bodyline bowl-
ing had kept radio fans away from the
talkies?
What does seem strange, and in some
cases strange to the point' of incredi-
bility, is the long-standing existence of
terms we are apt to regard as being of
very modern usage.
One often hears appendicitis described
(mostly by those who have not suffered
from it) as a twentieth-century fashion.
Would it surprise those sneerers to know
that, according to the best authorities,
appendicitis was called appendicitis as
early as 1886? According to the same
authorities the word swimming-pool is
much younger in years, having reached
common use only in 1932. What, then,
were swimming-pools called before 1932?
It needed not the introduction of Pro-
hibition to the United States of America
to bring to an interested world the word
bootlegger. That gentleman was known
as such in 1889, and one wonders what
he “bootlegged” in those tranquil days.
Such apparently post-war words as speak-
easy and inhibition first made their
appearance in 1889, too.
Cricket crowds barracked even in
the gay ’nineties, which decade also pro-
duced the now-defunct flapper. Femin-
ists, gangsters, Sealyhams and shop-assis-
tants were also revealed to a grateful
world in the same 10 years, not to men-
tion hooligans, highballs, aspirin, radium
and bank holidays.
The new century was ushered in with
such novelties as grafter and ukulele, fol-
lowed in 1901 by backchat, Chink (for
Chinaman), Homburg hat, pacificism,
scenic railway and shamateur. Gadgets
(a veteran of 1886) became foolproof
only in 1902, and in that year, too, tripe
became synonymous for rubbish.
Subject of so many modern ditties, co-
eds came to light in 1904, and maybe
they took a major part in bestowing the
words stunt and sundae on the public in
that year. As if to counteract these two
minor nuisances third-degree methods
and ultra-violet rays made their appear-
ance at the same time.
In 1906 appeared marcels and psycho-
analysis, and anything humorous first
made a cat laugh in 1907. Possibly the
cat laughed because the inimitable G.B.S.
had in that year begun to make his pres-
ence felt to such an extent that the word
Shavian was especially coined to describe
his antics.
The years 1908 and 1909 were busy
ones for the word-spinners, for there
appeared such a kaleidoscopic jumble as
chiropractic, cubism, josher, lonesome,
night out, big noise, futurism, jigsaw (we
thought that was of newer birth), joyrides,
scroungers and thick ears —those last
three being a combination that offers pos-
sibilities to the imaginative.
SOS was officially adopted as the in-
ternational distress signal in 1908, but it
had to wait until the Titanic inquiry in
1912 before it achieved popularity.
The giddy sparks of 1911 first ad-
dressed their more youthful female
friends as baby, despite the fact that
highbrows came into being in that year.
Perhaps the reason was that the same
year saw the introduction of parking and
the revival of the pillion-seat.
Vitamins, those peculiar things we eat
and can’t pronounce properly, were first
invented, discovered or imagined, what-
ever is the correct word, in 1911. Food
manufacturers and publishers of home
journals took some time to realise their
value as a means of increasing sales.
The year before the Great War gave
us atmospherics, junk (rubbish), motor
bandits, movies and profiteers, and the
next fateful 12 months sprang ballyhoo
and birth control upon an astonished
world.
That wonderful word raspberry, indic-
ative of disgust, is nearly 20 years old,
having first seen the light of day in 1915.
The war years were productive mostly of
mechanical terms, notable exceptions
being Jane (woman), attaboy, defeatist,
Soviet and Girl Guide.
The first hectic years after the war
were responsible for a crop of interesting
words, such as beauty spot, blotto, fade-
out, jazz. League of Nations, lipstick,
mandated, pussyfoot and shimmy (a
dance). Plus-fours, sobstuff, stainless
steel and X-raying came into common
use in 1920.
A drunken man was “canned” for the
first time in 1921, and people then first
spoke of dancing partners and going off
the deep end. Broadcasting brought itself
and announcer in the following year, and
the poor public was still more bewildered
by vamping, uplift, Coueism, Fascism and
insulin.
America, the home of ingenious words,
excelled itself with mortician in 1923.
Blackshirts, mah jongg and loudspeakers
were three other afflictions of that un-
happy year.
Wisecrack gained circulation in 1924,
and a little later jay-walkers and pullover
were current literary coin. Since then
the world has advanced apace, and no one
would mistake companionate marriage,
gatecrasher, gigolo, hiker, wow, perm,
racketeer and big shot for anything else
but very up-to-date American.
Who says now that there is nothing
new under the sun? A visit to any talk-
ing picture will afford definite proof to
the contrary.

A Satchel of Books
Dents have undertaken the revision of
the whole of their “Master Musicians”
series, which was rounded off last year
by the addition of Marion M. Scott’s
Beethoven. This and the revised edi-
tions of C. F. Abdy Williams’s Bach,
Lawrence Erb’s Brahms and J. Cuth-
bert Hadden’s Haydn came to hand
some months ago. They are now fol-
lowed by J. Cuthbert Hadden’s Chopin,
S. Stephen Stratton’s Mendelssohn, E.
Duncan’s Schubert and Annie W. Pat-
terson’s Schumann. The revisions, by
Eric Blom, have included a good deal of
rewriting, a liberal scattering of apposite
footnotes and the bringing up to date of
appendices cataloguing the works of
the various composers —new facts occa-
sionally come to light still regarding dates
and dedications. There is room yet for
some vigorous sub-editing—the Schu-
bert biography, in especial, is full of
repetitions—but the volumes are reliable,
and the series remains the best of the
kind in English. Price is 4s. 6d. net per
vol.
Church of England Divines and the
Anglican Tradition, issued by the En-
deavour Press, is a reprint of the Moor-
house lectures for 1933, delivered by
Dean Talbot, of Sydney. The historical
survey commences with Bede and works
through Anselm, Wycliffe, Jewell, Hooker,
Cosin and Simeon down to Pusey and
Westcott. It traverses many famous con-
troversies, and, as the subject was chosen
in view of the centenary of the Oxford
Movement, this development receives due
attention.
Music-makers of the Sunny South, by
Gladys Rhys Davies (Robertson and
Mullens ; 2s. 6d.), is a sort of brief bio-
graphical index of Victoria’s musicians,
past and present. The roll is an impos-
ing one. In Melbourne were born Melba,
Austral, Amy Castles, Madame Conly,
Frances Alder and Horace Stevens, all
singers of world-wide fame ; May Brahe
and Alfred Hill, who have made their
mark as composers, and Percy Grainger
and Ernest Hutcheson, who are both very
highly respected and handsomely remun-
erated in the U.S.A. Geelong boasts John
Brownlee, a Gippsland hamlet claims
Ada Crossley, Bendigo gave the world
that very fine pianist and cultured musi-
cian William Murdoch, and Ballarat has
Madame Balara (she made her name in
opera in Germany) and William James,
whose “Six Australian Bush Songs” are
as well known and as much admired in
Britain and Europe as they are in Aus-
tralia. In Miss Davies’s record are also
to be found names that were famous in
the Australia of the ’sixties, such as
Madame Carandini and' Madame Anna
Bishop, but they, of course, were Aus-
tralians by adoption only. With such a
respectable record to draw upon the
authoress might have refrained from
dragging in George Clutsam, who was
born in Sydney, and Gladys Moncrieff,
who hails from Bundaberg.
Shakspeare Head Press (they spell it
with the other “e”) have put out the
best single vol. Shakspeare the Red
Page has seen. Binding green cloth (and
well bound), type of the neatest; pages
1280; and price so low that it looks,
for the job, a misprint—6s. English, or,
say, about 10s. Australian.
Laikan : The Story of a Salmon (Rich
and Cowan; Robertson and IVlullens;
75.) is a nature story that is different.
Laikan is born in the upper reaches of
the Rhine, makes his way to the North
Sea, has hairbreadth escapes every day
of his life, explores strange rivers, has
many matings, grows huge and old, and
is eventually killed in the small stream
in which he was born. Like most Ger-
man nature writers, Wenter casts off the
stolidity considered typical of his race;
at times he becomes almost lyrical.
The Western District Centenary Sou-
venir (“Express,” Terang, Vic. ; 25.) is
evidence of how country towns, even
small country towns, are lifting them-
selves into a class formerly monopolised
by the cities. Terang is a town of little
more than 2500 people, yet the office of
its local newspaper has turned out in a
manner of which any printing establish-
ment in the world might be proud
this volume on the whole western
district of Vic-
toria.
PI ay in g the
Like, by Ber-
nard Darwin
(Chapman and
Hall; 7s. 6d.).
The latest addi-
tion to this
author’s long list
of golf books
consists largely of
articles and
sketches reprint-
ed from the
“Times” and
“Country Life.”
He draws rever-
ent portraits of
champions of
other days, and
regards St. An-
drews as holy
ground. In the
main, however,
the book is de-
voted to short
sketches dealing
with every phase
of golf, and the
author’s t h o r-
ough know-
ledge of the
game and of the
peculiarities of
the leading
courses and play-
er s, combined
with his enter-
taining qualities
as a writer, makes
it a book that all
golfers will de-
light in.
A Choice of Verse:—
REST-HOUSE VERANDAH.
The fall of evening is the rebirth of knowing :
it is then the body looks up and is not alone,
for an old thought mingled with a newer thought
swells, breads the dam and sets the whole tide flowing.
The tropic light over the sugarcane
was weary daylong; and the eyes only sought
to escape its color, running from tuft to tuft;
but with evening we grow watchful, are even fain
note how yellow of sunset can impress
its strength upon native green, how the green, rebuffed,
climbs helter-skelter to palm-tops, where they stoop,
weighed under feather-branches, their headdress.
All day the body died, the mind was a dozer,
but as in the cool the gathering shadows group
so now some energies come back from straying .
we again grow part of our universe, hold it closer,
and have zest for listening, seeing and marking down—
but yonder a song and a u\ulele playing :
island airs sing in the heart its bitter truth . . .
It is easier to let vague longings possess their own,
stretch and relax, though almost we \new some urge
to ta\e up again the dropped threads of our youth.
FIJI.

“Unified control be hanged! What YOU want is a beautiful Federal Constitution, with seven Parliaments, seven Governments, six Supreme
Courts and a flock of Arbitration Courts, and a High Court to tell everybody that nobody can do anything.”

EXIT THE SAAR PROBLEM.
An anxious year for the League of
Nations has ended with a decisive vote
by the Saarlanders for their reabsorption
into Germany. The electorate consisted
entirely of people who had been brought
up as German subjects—persons who
were resident in the district when it was
temporarily sliced off Germany in Janu-
ary, 1920. The population then was
657,000, so that, allowing for persons
dead, imprisoned and insane, and for
children under six years at the time
of the signing of the treaty, the actual
528,704 voters must have included virtu-
ally everyone entitled to vote.
Many had been brought from coun-
tries as far away as China and Califor-
nia. Their interest was only sentiment.
The great majority had remained rooted
in the soil, and their vote was a sacrifice.
They abandoned dual-customs benefits,
government by a tolerant League Com-
mission and low taxation for the iron rule
of Hitler and the high taxation and ser-
vice obligations of Germany.
Voting was by communes, and every
commune contributed a majority to the
vote of 477,109 for return to the Reich.
The 46,513 who were for the status quo
were animated by hatred and fear of
Hitlerism rather than by any affection
for the Commission, which has been
described as “just—but as popular as a
card catalogue.” As there would be on
an Australian coalmining field, there are
a somewhat substantial Socialist vote and
a smaller Communist vote, and there is
a community of Jews. It is on the actions
of these groups that future peace or tur-
moil depends. If they refuse to submit
to the German law and methods which
Hitler will soon have an undoubted right
to apply to them, the League’s faith in the
sacred rights of minorities will be tested.
Hitler has promised that his methods
will be tolerant and conciliatory ; pro-
mised also that “there will be no more
territorial claims on France.” His assur-
ances are evidently sincere, and seem-
ingly responsibility is sobering him, as
it did Mussolini. In any case, the Eng-
lish-speaking world will have to reconcile
itself to the fact, now obvious, that the
Germans accept his regime as the Italians
do the Duce’s, though it has been stuffed
with very different stories by newspapers
like the Manchester “Guardian” and pro-
pagandists like Egon Kisch.
Only 2124 votes were cast for union
with France. Yet Clemenceau told the
Peace Conference that 150,000 inhabi-
tants were French.
From Hitler’s point of view, the Saar
problem is largely economic, A year
ago Von Papen, himself a Saarlander,
told a meeting at Coblenfz that it was
not, but he also said that Berlin was
“preparing to place the whole production
of the Saar Valley on the German domes-
tic market.” This is no small item —the
district is capable of producing 10,500,000
metric tons of coal, 2,000,000 tons of
coke and 4,000,000 tons of iron and
steel p.a. This output matters less to
France than to Germany, since the Pas de
Calais mines, for which the Saar mines
were handed over as compensation, are
now restored to production. Even the
fact that Saar coal and Lorraine iron go
together does not matter so much as it
did —expanding use of electricity and oil
fuels on the railways, which in 25 years
may not be using coal at all, makes all
the difference. France has ample metal
resources against the shrinking demand ;
Germany has not.
The quietness of the poll and the
apparent determination of Hitler to find
the money to buy back the mines from
the French have been greeted with sighs
of relief everywhere. Twelve months
ago the Nazi Front leader nailed the
legend “Prussian State Government Ad-
ministration” over his Saarbriicken office
door, and was forcing the Jews to close
the local ghetto. Herr Roechling, one of
the most prominent pro-German indus-
trialists, was prosecuted for warning
opponents that if they did not withdraw
their children from French-speaking
schools they would be regarded as
“traitors to Germany.” French troops
were on the border. The little valley
was definitely a plague spot which might
infect the whole world with war fever.
To-day, thanks very largely to British
commonsense, to the tact of R. A. Eden,
the Foreign Office Under-Secretary—he
was in Australia in 1925, and he belongs
to a Yorkshire family of newspaper-
owners which gave its title to Auckland
(M.L.) —and to the good management of
the Australian Geoffrey Knox, the worst
of the danger is over.
“OVERRUN WITH QUACKS.”
The N.S.W. Stevens Government evi-
dently agrees with C. S. Crouch, retired
secretary of the Victorian 8.M.A., as to
the need for legislation to clip the wings
of quacks (B, 9/1/’35). It is preparing
a bill to deal with charlatans who, as Mr.
Weaver expresses it, “take people’s money
for professing to cure cancer and other
diseases”—“nothing more than robbers,”
he calls them. Apart from the latitude
given to ignoramuses and humbugs who
pose as medical healers, there is nothing
in N.S.W. law at present to prevent any
person from installing a 600,000-volt deep
X-ray-therapy machine and using it on
his fellow-citizens. Should he kill some-
body, the law or relatives may have
something to say, but the dead are mute
about their grievances.
If Mr. Weaver has his way tests not
now imposed will be required of doctors.
As matters stand, a fledgling who has
secured his degree may set up as a
specialist without having undergone
special training. Or he may become a
general practitioner without having done
any hospital work. Discussing N.S.W.
medical graduates in general, the Minister
says 95 p.c. “obtain hospital experience
under competent men” ; but, as he con-
tends, 95 p.c. is not enough. He will
have the public and a great many
doctors with him if he makes it 100 p.c.
“A.D.” suggests that the medical pro-
fession is not guiltless of responsibility
for “the prosperity of the quack”:
A proportion of his clients have had treatment
from qualified men and have turned to him as
a last resource. Maybe they cannot continue to
pay the medico’s charges. In some cases,
doctors have so differed in diagnosis and treat-
ment that the patient loses faith. Cases per-
sonally known to the writer afford some justifi-
cation for lack of faith.
Case A, a child complaining of “pains in
the side.” The doctor, after stethoscopic ex-
amination, said gravely, “I don’t like the mur-
muring I find in the mitral valve.” The
alarmed mother asked if that were serious;
the reply was that it would become so unless
promptly checked. Prescribed treatment was
that the patient lie flat for several weeks. After
a month the father called in another doctor,
who pooh-poohed the valvular trouble. The
tonsils were unhealthy, and would have to
be removed, but that was all. “You can hear
a murmuring in the mitral with 90 per cent, of
people,” said doctor No. 2. The tonsils
were excised —a five-minute, ten-guinea opera-
tion —and the child was soon normal. There
was a little murmuring when doctor No. 1
sent in his bill.
Case B, the same patient seven years later.
Now very robust, she dislocated her shoulder
while romping. The dislocation having been
reduced, an X-ray was urged to make sure
that all was in proper order and position. The
photographs were handed to the parents by
the doctor, who said: “I could read them, but
the job’s not mine. Please take them to a
radiologist.” (There is certainly a spirit of
camaraderie among doctors. The lines of de-
marcation between what is or is not their job
are much finer than those drawn by plumber,
carpenter and electrician.) The radiologist said
all was well, and collected his fee; but should
not the doctor who adjudged the dislocation
have had sufficient knowledge of anatomy to
determine whether the setting was right or not?
Case C, a man of 45 with periodical
attacks of indigestion. He was X-rayed, after
a meal of barium. When the slides were avail-
able the medico said beamingly; “I have very
good news for you. There is no growth. I
think you ought to have your gall-bladder re-
moved, and that should end your trouble.”
The patient suffered a week of intense pain
and nausea; he was then told that the operation
had been very successful and that as a pre-
caution the appendix had been removed. Six
weeks afterwards there emerged from hospital
a sadder, poorer but not much wiser man.
Soon his old ailment came back.
He was sent to another practitioner. His
digestive processes were looked into, and it was
found that he had a rare deficiency in
some secretion. To counteract that he was
given a chart of all the things he could con-
sume without detriment. The chart was multi-
graphed. Cases D and E, both dyspeptic sub-
jects, now enter. They, at various times, con-
sulted the same practitioner. Like State Trea-
surers, one had a deficiency and the other a
surplus. Each received a multigraphed chart;
the three charts when compared were identical.
There are hundreds of excellent, sincere,
unselfish, self-sacrificing doctors. The profession
has its full share of brilliance and of virtue,
but this writer impeaches it for failure to deal
with its incompetents and its exploiters. The
Law Institute will haul a legal malefactor to
court and there expose him. It will investi-
gate the conduct of a solicitor promptly and
efficiently on receipt of a genuine complaint.
Redress against the unskilful, overcharging,
negligent doctor is almost impossible. For
which reason as much as any other we hear
the complaint that we are “overrun with
quacks.”
H.W.M.”: The remedy for quackery is to
be found m the registering of men proficient
in sectional medicine and surgery. There are
such men in Melbourne; medical men recog-
ffi se but dare not associate with them,
though they have been known to send patients'
to these men “under the lap.”
Sir Herbert Barker, the bone manipulator,
was persecuted in England for practising and
pronounced a “quack.” Eventually even his
greatest enemies and _ critics had to acknow-
ledge his supremacy in his line. His career
lends force to the contention that some drastic
alteration should be made with regard to the
present medical course in order that certifi-
cates of competency might be issued for sec-
tional medicine and surgery. This innovation
would sound the death-knell of bogus healers;
at the same time, it would give the genuine
healer an opportunity of demonstrating his
skill and obtaining a license to practise in one
or two special branches without having to
spend years in acquiring a general knowledge
which cannot help him to follow his bent.
PLANNING FOR MELBOURNE.
Ten or twelve years ago a Town-plan-
ning Commission was appointed in
Melbourne. The thing was done
half-heartedly; insufficient money was
allotted, and after a time the commission
was permitted to fizzle out. But a for-
tunate accident happened ; the Govern-
ment fluked as chief executive officer
a man who probably knows more about
the subject than anybody else in Victoria
—A. J. Macdonald, Originally an archi-
tect by profession, and an enthusiast at
his job, Macdonald worked like a piece
of modern high-speed machinery and
committed the dreams of a lifetime to
papers which should be among the most
valued possessions of the future city of
Melbourne.
Some of his ideas are calculated to
make the present-day Babbitt smile at
their magnificence, just as Wren’s scheme
for remodelling London after the Fire
raised laughter among the Babbitts of
1666 and brought tears to later genera-
tions because they had not been adopted.
Macdonald wishes to shift the Yarra
some hundreds of feet further south and
extend the city over the site of the exist-
ing river. This would afford space
for a central square, which Melbourne
badly needs; it would prevent floods
and provide other advantages. The
area south of the new river he
would make the civic centre, with a new
Town Hall standing in the midst of
a cluster of important public buildings.
He would cut diagonal streets through
the existing city to simplify traffic prob-
lems, and generally do what Haussmann
did to Paris.
But Macdonald did not deal merely
with the city. He took the whole metro-
polis into his range of vision. Lord
Mayor Wales advocates one of the town-
planner’s minor recommendations —the
creation of a road from Jolimont to the
Monash Bridge, which would relieve
overcrowded Swanston-street and con-
sign the mad races of cars along Welling-
ton-parade to the litter of unpleasant
memories. The roadway would pass at
the rear of the Melbourne Cricket
Ground. Naturally it would mean an
alienation of park lands, but this objec-
tion could be overcome by buying a
corresponding area in slum suburbs for
the same purpose. Not one large area; it
would be better to have a dozen scat-
tered small parks than one big park.
Already there are vague plans for re-
purchasing allotments here and there in
Richmond, Collingwood and Port Mel-
bourne and turning them into gar-
dens or children’s playgrounds. Private
benefactions have shown what can be
done in this way in Prahran.
Another feature of Macdonald’s
scheme which might be considered in
view of the necessity of providing work
of value for the unemployed is the re-
modelling of Prahran’s business quarter.
Chapel-street, Prahran, is the most im-
portant business street in Victoria out-
side the city itself. It is a narrow thor-
oughfare a couple of miles long, and the
motorist who gets behind a tram at one
end has little chance of passing it until
the tram reaches the other end. On the
east side of Chapel-street the shops are
backed by a succession of lanes. Mac-
donald proposes that these lanes should
be widened and connected to form a
continuous street, and that Chapel-street
and the new street should be restricted to
one-way traffic, entirely liquidating the
costly and inconvenient jamb which
meets drivers of all vehicles six days in
the week.
The completed scheme for remodel-
ling the metropolis will probably not
come for many years—possibly not be-
fore the celebration of the next centenary
—but it must not be pigeonholed and
forgotten. The plans of the whole
should be pasted on the wall of the
Town Hall so that each succeeding coun-
cil may visualise what Melbourne should
be like and be inspired to move a little
towards the consummation of a fine
ideal.
THIS LAWN TENNIS.
Lawn tennis, once regarded as merely a
pleasant social game, in the same cate-
gory as croquet, is having an immense
vogue as a spectacle. It is played all
over the world and all the year round,
leading exponents of both sexes travel-
ling from country to country and from
continent to continent. Except for a
handful of avowed professionals, they all
rank as amateurs; so, while their hotel
and travelling expenses are paid by their
hosts, as are those of Rugby Union foot-
ballers, they must be possessed of con-
siderable private means.
Time is no object to these people or
to those who stage their performances.
It is nothing for a tournament to last a
fortnight, and, as the public shows itself
ready to pay higher prices than are
charged for admission to almost any
other form of outdoor sport in which
gambling is not a feature, the gate re-
ceipts are beginning to make the mouths
of cricket and football officials water.
The ninth day of the international tourna-
ment at Kooyong drew “the largest mid-
week gathering that has ever watched a
tennis contest in Victoria” ; the estimate
was 5000 spectators at 7s. 6d., ss. and
2s. 6d. On the tenth day, with the tariff
raised to Bs. 6d., ss. 6d. and 35., there
were nearly 8000 watchers, and 12,000
arrived on the eleventh, and last, day,
paying 10s. 6d., 6s. 6d. and 3s. “Approxi-
mately £5130” was taken altogether.
And the game has developed a jour-
nalism of its own; in fact, most of the
champions are themselves journalists of
a sort. But whether the chroniclers are
players or non-players there is a curious
sameness about their stuff. All the girls
have pet-names and rarely fail to “rise
to great heights” ; the men “rise to great
heights,” too, in the process of “fighting”
—for “us” or for “England” or for some
'other country, as the case may be. No-
thing could be less suggestive of war than
the spectacle of two amiable-looking
youths in flannels smacking a soft ball
over a net on a grass court for hours at
a stretch; but they are all men of war
to the writers —now “Homeric,” now
twentieth-century heroes. One genius
wrote a few years ago;
As in the .dark days of 1914, when the
German hordes were pouring over the
frontiers, France stands ready to repel the
invaders. Cochet and Lacoste
Wallis Myers carries on the tradition:
There is a disposition to remain in the
trench and not to go over the top. Perry
was the subdued warrior on Saturday, and
he ended by becoming a submissive one.
He found to his cost that automajtis driving
—artillery fire without any closer view of
the enemy—was an inadequate attack
against Crawford’s infinite resource and
patience.
They all try to write like that.
Cynics see in the extraordinary popu-
larity of this innocuous pastime a sign
of the increasing feminisation of the race.
It is probably more intimately related
to the decline of musical comedy and the
’halls. Young people bred to an open-
air life go to the tennis much as their
parents went to the play. For them the
ball-boy has superseded the call-boy;
the courts have a glamor which the stage
has ceased to possess. In their new
theatre they see an interesting lot
of performers—all young, and many
with striking personal attractions—doing
superlatively well what they themselves
would like to do half as well. And,
except that they don’t sing or dance, the
new performers are very like the old ones.
Some have their comic ways ; others give
exhibitions of vanity and petulance.
There is a tendency even to dress like
actors. Tights are not yet a tennis
fashion, but many of the girls—on the
south, at least —leave off as much as
ballerinas.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
State Governors.
Sir Philip Game had a marvellous send-
off. For over a week he received depu-
tations from bodies whose speakers
applauded his work, and as he had a
good press towards the end of his regime
his farewells got plenty of publicity. At
a special valedictory service in St.
Andrew’s, Dr. Mowll preached from a
celebrated text on the Governor’s growth
“in stature and in grace.”
Sir Philip certainly did grow in grace ;
he grew twice, and each time in a dif-
ferent place, so to speak. He began by
trying to make friends with Mr. Lang,
Mr. Lang’s Ministers and Mr. Donald
Grant. The same residents of Bellevue
Hill and environs who rushed to Govern-
ment House to cheer him last week were
rushing there to take their names off his
official book in 1930.
The Lang Government was dismissed,
and the tide turned. From being
anathema to Bellevue Hill the Governor
became its idol. The Langsters turned
hostile ; and they remained so to the end.
The Governor’s name has been received
with groans at Labor meetings.
It is deplorable that the King, through
his representative, should be subjected to
such treatment; but it is difficult to see
how similar happenings are to be avoided
in future if we go on importing State
Governors. The leader of the larger
N.S.W. Labor faction is anti-English.
He has announced that he doesn’t
want the National Anthem to be played
at any gathering which he attends ; he
is proud of never having visited England
and of not being a Government House
frequenter.
Anti-Laborites, on the other hand,
assume a sort of proprietary right in
English Governors, and are annoyed
when one shows radical tendencies,
as Sir Philip Game did at the be-
ginning of his N. S. Wales term. So —in
N. S. Wales, anyhow—the Governor is
always liable to be represented as the
political opponent of nearly half the
population.
Such a situation has never arisen under
a Lieut.-Governor, and it is doubtful if it
would or could arise. Lieut.-Governors are
nearly always Judges or ex-Judges who
have spent their professional lifetimes
acquiring merit as dispensers of impartial
justice on the spot between man and man
and class and class. It would be useless
to try to involve one of them in a poli-
tical row. Accusations of bias would
fall flat equally in the Trades Hall and
the Union Club.
But the best arrangement of all might
be to dispense with both imported Gov-
ernors and local Lieut.-Governors and
have the constitutional and ceremonial
duties of the Governor, by no means
onerous now, and likely to be still less
exacting in the future, performed by the
State Chief Justice of the day.

A Job for the Senate.
There are good men in the Senate,
though the Chamber has never fulfilled
the hopes of its founders, and it is a
standing marvel that they should, year
after year, accept the obsequious role
assigned to them —that of hanging around
Canberra with little or nothing to do
until the last week or so of a session,
when the Government orders the Senate
to pass 30 or 40 bills and look sharp
about it. A Canberra representative of
the Melbourne “Herald” group suggests
to them, very pertinently, that they
should breathe new life into the standing-
committee system and boldly exercise
their right to disallow obnoxious regu-
lations.
There is a Senate standing com-
mittee on regulations, and it made the
interesting discovery that regulations
spread over 11,263 pages had been issued,
largely on the authority of Jacks-in-office,
under Acts of Parliament which occupy
3708 pages. But it thereupon shrank into
a shell from which it has not emerged.
Government by regulation is a spread-
ing evil because it has encountered no
resistance. The Senate is uniquely placed
to lead the fight against it, and it is a
job in which members of all parties could
combine.
“Take Out Muh Ad.!”
“Everyone’s,” a Sydney movie journal,
has existed for 14 years, chiefly on the
advertisements of American distributors.
It caters for N. S. Wales exhibitors —
describes new releases; publishes box-
office barometers of leading Sydney pic-
ture-houses ; and, generally, helps coun-
try and suburban film-buyers in their
trade.
All went well till the Stevens Govern-
ment talked of imposing a distributors’
quota. “Everyone’s” supported the
scheme. In a single week —at an hour
or two’s notice in some cases; —the paper
lost all its distributors’ advertisements.
It happened, oddly enough, a few days
before the news arrived that a Federal
Grand Jury in St. Louis had
indicted 12 motion-picture corporations,
including Warner Brothers, Paramount,
Vitaphone, First National and Metro-Gold-
wyn-Mayer, for alleged violation of the
anti-trust laws by refusal to supply a St.
Louis exhibitor with films.
The cases are not parallel, but an
examination of our anti-trust laws might
be worth while if Attorney-General
Menzies is interested. The Common-
wealth Parliament passed as many in its
early days as Congress did over the same
period. The rights of the individual get
little attention now, but our lawmakers
had a great respect for them then.

Wanted: A League of Decency.
In 1932 England achieved the Road
Traffic Act, which, amongst other things,
did away with a speed limit for
motor-cars. The effect was not felt till
the following year. Writing on “Motors
and Motoring” in the “ ‘Daily Mail’
Year-Book, 1934,” Sir Malcolm Camp-
bell remarked:
Unfortunately it is impossible to record
—as I was able to do a year ago—that
the toll of the road has shown a tendency
to decrease. On the contrary, there has
been an upward trend in the figures re-
lating to road accidents.
The British figures for 1934 have
arrived by cable:
Accidents numbered 204,800, an increase
of 13,018 compared with the previous year.
The 1934 figures for N. S. Wales, which
came to hand at about the same time,
show that 319 persons were killed and
5508 injured, as against 290 killed and
4204 injured in 1933, An analysis of
the causes of the accidents, which are
matched roughly in all the States, indi-
cates the trouble. Skidding (due prac-
tically always to excessive speed) caused
39 deaths; overtaking and cutting-in
(speed again) 22 deaths ; carelessness at
intersections (which is to say, in ninety-
nine cases out of every hundred, speed-
ing past intersections) 18 deaths, and
plain speed 21 deaths.
As car-speeds increase, and with them
accidents, civilised communities will have
to answer the question: Is the carnage
worth the fun? For excessive speed is
practically always a form of fun. The
time gained by that extra 30 m.p.h. which
may represent the difference between life
and death to somebody will be wasted,
as often as not, at the next pub. The
speedster is hardly ever a good citizen
on duty bound ; generally a flash yahoo.
The only alternative to the reimposi-
tion of speed-limits, which nobody wants,
seems to be the effective policing of the
roads by decent motorists (who, after all,
immensely outnumber the hogs) and
the general public. The traffic police
do splendid work, but they can’t be on
the spot every time a driver whizzes
round a sharp corner or passes a school
with his car out of hand.
A League of Decency would do much
to discourage these practices which are
responsible for most of the accidents to
old people and children. It is useless for
an individual civilian to take an offending
motorist’s number; one man’s word is
as good as another’s in a police court.
The evidence of three or four leaguers,
whether motorists or pedestrians, would
be harder to shake. Dread of the results
should bring many dangerous motorists
to their senses; it might even keep some
of them sober.

Win-Tie-or-Lie.
Liars have obviously had access to the
ears and legs of correspondents sending
matter to Australia about the situation
in the Saar. According to one account
Plebiscite Day dawned with “foreign
troops in battle order standing-to with
fixed bayonets at all strategic points.”
An anti-Jewish boycott has commenced.
Beatings of anti-Nazis increase; there is an
ugly atmosphere in the streets, and the
Nazis are broadcasting every conceivable
form of intimidation.
Two days later the truth came out:
The most formidable missiles were snow-
balls, the only fighters children. Good-
humored laughter marked the closing of the
poll. International troops, except those
detailed to guard voting urns, remained in
barracks, writing letters, playing skittles
and listening to the wireless. An English
returning-officer said; “The poll has been
far more orderly than an English election.”
All this engenders the suspicion that
Australians have been fed with falsehoods
about other events in Germany. They
will be chary of believing atrocity yarns
in future.

The Search for Oil.
Overseas opinion till recently held that
oil existed along two defined belts. One
starts at the Pyrenees, follows the moun-
tains across the south of Europe and
through southern Asia and, via Borneo
and New Guinea, peters out in
Maoriland. The other forms the
backbone of America. At the west-
ern European and far-north Ameri-
can extremities not much oil has been
found, though small quantities exist.
Both belts belong to the Tertiary period.
The biggest finds have been where the
land sinks suddenly from a high moun-
tain range to below sea level or to a
river delta where there are abundant
ancient marine deposits. The Roumanian
field, Baku and the Anglo-Persian fields
are all examples of this formation.
Some of these conditions for oil exist
in Australia—for instance, where the
Flinders Range in S.A. sinks down to
Lake Frome —but by the theories held
till recently by men like E. H. Cunning-
ham Craig, recognised as one of the
greatest of authorities, the formation is
600,000,000 years too old. Sir John Cad-
man, head of Anglo-Persian Oil, who
has been in Australia, now says that “no-
body can say that oil does not exist in
Australia”:
In the opinion of expert geologists in
London there is a possibility of finding oil
in formations in which a few years ago
it was considered practically impossible.
On his return to England he is to
select a geologist from the Anglo-Persian
staff to act for the Government and the
C.O.R. The Anglo-Persian some years
ago discovered oil in Papua, but because
the bores had to operate through beds
of shifting sand it was impossible to
obtain a flow.
The discovery of supplies in Australia
would be a great thing for the Common-
wealth. So far, except for Roma gas, a
bit of a seepage in North Westralia, a
few deposits on the surfaces of water-
holes in the N.T. and a lot of good oil
of the kind of which there is a gusher
in every Stock Exchange, the expendi-
ture of a good many thousands has failed
to produce any.

Women in Parliament.
The widow of ex-Premier Peacock has
announced her intention of saying good-
bye to Parliament and not contesting the
seat of Allandale, now held by herself
and held by her late husband for half
a lifetime. She has expressed the view
that the job is too strenuous for a woman,
and those who have had any experience
of Parliaments will be inclined to agree
with her.
Australian politics call for more
physical endurance than the politics
of European and American States where
women have loomed largely on the lists
of membership. It is not that sessions are
overlong; there is ample holiday time
arranged in every State by Governments,
no matter what their color. It is that
Parliaments, when in action, sit continu-
ously and sit late, entailing a nervous
strain on strong men and presenting an
ordeal which a wise woman would do
well to dodge. Moreover, many con-
stituencies are very exacting.
It is a pity. The time has passed
when man was conceited enough and
brave enough to take the stand that
women had not brains enough to be
members of Parliament. To-day every-
body is agreed that woman’s contribu-
tion to the debates would be of consider-
able value, while a glance around the
personnel of public bodies and institutions
shows many women whose organising
ability is acknowledged. There is every
reason to believe that, if women were
given a fair chance, the quality of legis-
lation would be improved.
Women have no respect for precedent;
their guiding motto is “Do it now.” Even
the most revolutionary of men are apt to
regard the fact of something never hav-
ing been done before as reason for delay,
if not rejection. Women, again, have a
remarkable sense of fair play in abstract
matters—sadly lacking though they may
be when the matters become personal.
The most conservative woman will grow
liberal if some question of humani-
tarian interest is brought under her
notice; the most revolutionary woman
will relax into mildness if she is shown
that her reform would wreak grave in-
justice. Most important of all, woman
is more honest than man in big things.
And her vanity is a little thing, hinging on
silk stockings and lipsticks, whereas the
vanity of a man renders him liable to a
form of corruption even more dangerous
than actual acceptance of a bribe.
4
One Reason for Unemployment.
The “Jeames” Plan:
In Britain —and to an extent all over the
Empire —before the war there was no more
respectable figure than the Man of Leisure.
Few worked who could afford not to work, and
indigent members of the so-called upper classes
were expected to confine their income-earning
activities to a few professions—chiefly the army,
navy and civil service. Girls, unless driven
to work by want, lived at home; affluent young
men spent their money in clubs, on travel,
sport, elaborate clothes and so on.
The scope of the British genteel professions,
which used to absorb young men with incomes
of from £l5O to umpteen thousands p.a. from
all over the Empire, has been narrowed by
about 50 p.c. as a result of post-war develop-
ments. According to the latest estimates, the
British Regular, Territorial and Reserve forces
have shrunk to 470,000 from 750,000 (pre-war);
the personnel of the R.N. has been greatly
reduced, and there have been startling changes
in the civil services. The I.C.S. used to be
almost entirely recruited from a few great
public schools; this year, with the exception of
one Rugby success, all the appointments have
gone to high- and grammar-school products.
The same thing is happening in the consular,
and even in the diplomatic service.
A convention has grown up that not to work
is disgraceful, even if you don’t need the
money. So young men who have been crowded
out of professions in which they might have
done better work than the examination wallahs
are turning to callings for which, in many cases,
they have no particular qualifications. Fleet-
street swarms with them. They are becoming
policemen, to the annoyance of those who dis-
like Oxford accents in traffic cops. Others are
taking to interior-decorating, photography, shop-
walking and the movies. Old Etonians work
as house and estate agents’ clerks, or as man-
agers of night clubs, country clubs and pubs,
in fierce competition with Old Wykehamists and
Old Harrovians. I have had a car cleaned
and polished in England by an Old Carthusian,
aged about 23.
Simultaneously the girls have burst into the
employment-world in their millions; not only
those who, like most typists, milliners and shop-
assistants, make good use of their earnings,
but those who can afford to throw their
earnings away. These amateur toilers are
usually publicity- or husband-seekers. Their
names are attached to newspaper articles; they
“edit” fashion sections under the control of
real journalists; contribute to the scandal rags;
publish novels that have been vamped up for
them by literary “ghosts”; serve in smart
shops; exhibit their charms as mannequins;
and in scores of other directions add to the
unemployment problem by doing needy pro-
fessionals out of jobs.
Employers could ease this situation in a very
short time if they combined to bar workers of
independent means. I recognise the difficulties.
Some newspaper proprietaries are the worst
offenders, and a first condition of success
would be for the press to revolutionise the
public attitude towards idleness. A volte-face,
of course, but the stunt papers are used to that.
If the Empire could get back to the point of
view of those who thought there was nothing
shameful in loafing enjoyably, provided the
loafer had the money to do it with, and who
regarded as a curmudgeon a man of means
who let his womenfolk work or forced his sons
into menial occupations, the unemployment
might be brought down by 25 per cent.
4
Inalienable.
The decision of the Repatriation Com-
mission that the war veteran’s pension is
inalienable must win the support of
everybody old enough to remember the
war. The pensions are small enough in
all conscience, when it is remembered
what the soldiers and seamen did for
those who stayed behind and those who
grew into manhood and womanhood
in the days since 1919. Only the dwind-
ling group that went through the war
days knows the meaning of the word sac-
rifice, so ably used by every spellbinder
who mounts a soapbox.
The man who best realises the work
of the Digger is the other Digger who
fought by his side without injury during
those four horrifying years; but the larger
number who lived safely behind the lines
—thousands of miles behind in Austra-
lia —have a glimmering of the Digger’s
work which is denied to their younger
relatives and their children. It is up to
these to insist on the small privileges
which the Digger is granted to-day re-
maining intact.
The suggestion that the pension of the
Digger should no longer be inviolable—
that it should be liable to be seized
for debt —is unthinkable to every-
body who is capable of realising
what he did for all of us at a
time when we were ready to promise
anything. If Australia accepted that
position it would resemble the ingrate
who implores the doctor to save his
child’s life, making any extravagant offer
that comes to his mind ; and, when the
doctor has succeeded, refrains, though
well able, from paying a moderate fee.

Precautions Against Malaria.
“Say. 99”: “Quartan” (B. 9/1 /’35) is
quite right in indicating the dangers of
malaria and the necessity of taking pre-
cautions against the spreading of the
disease. There’s no doubt that, along
with bubonic plague, it was more de-
structive to Rome than the Vandal’s
sword; and the Greeks, had they but
known it, had more to fear from the
buzz of mosquitoes than that of Persian
arrows. How many millions, between
Babylon and Panama, have been chased
into their graves by the Anopheles mos-
quito nobody can say. But the main
point which should concern us is that
outbreaks are bound to arise in the
future if aeroplanes are not subjected to
some special health inspection. Accord-
ing to a recent “British Medical Jour-
nal,” it has been proved that passengers
from one non-malarious country to. an-
other can contract malaria on the jour-
ney from the bites of infected mosqui-
toes in the aircraft.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Zephyrus”: Our greengrocer, lately
wedded to a Scots lassie, called on
January 2 looking none the worse for
the New Year celebrations. “I was
pleased to be able to take the wife to a
real Scots gathering yesterday, with bag-
pipes and all,” he said. “Did they give
you a haggis?” I asked flippantly. He
looked puzzled and said dubiously, “I
don’t know much about them Scotch
tunes, but the wife could tell you.”
* * * H=
“Findy”; When the steamer Kaima-
nawa left Auckland recently for Japan
with the Komata in tow, she commenced
a big job ; but far longer tows have been
successfully accomplished. In 1925 the
Dutch tugs Willem Barendsz and Vlaan-
deren towed the gutted City of Singa-
pore from Port Adelaide to Rotterdam,
over 11,000 miles, and a couple of years
ago the Witte See and Schwartz See
brought out a floating dock from Europe
to Wellington (M.L.). These Dutch tug-
boats specialise in long-distance tows.
The longest tow made in recent years on
the Australian coast was recorded in
1932, when the tug Uco, of Fremantle,
went to the assistance of the Milluna,
which had broken a propeller-shaft near
Albany and was in desperate straits. The
Uco managed to get a line aboard and
towed the disabled steamer 1100 miles
to Adelaide.

“Red Rose”: “I. Temple’s” paragraph
about Lord Hewart, Chief Justice of
England, who recently took a second
wife at 65 (B. 9/1 /’35), recalls that a
younger brother of his Lordship was a
freelance journalist in this country until
his death a few years back. He had pre-
viously been on the Northcliffe papers in
London, and could write with a certain
knowledgeableness on the subject of
Fleet-street and the House of Commons.
The Hewart clan come from Bury in
Lancashire, which town, according to the
pressman, was also the birthplace of Aus-
tralia’s John Norton. And John, he
would add, on that account, had always
a warm corner in his heart for Lanca-
shire lads.

“Taberna”: The Barmen’s Union of
Sydney is striking a blow for more
hygienic pubs, or the drink-dispensing
sections thereof. It was needed ; there
are numerous taverns where, between
5 p.m. and 6 p.m. especially, the
flotsam and jetsam on the floor between
the bar-counter and the foot-rest is a
shuddersome thing to see. Custom, as
well as expediency, requires Bung to
provide counter-“lunch.” A dish strongly
in favor in the hour before closing-time is
sheep’s trotters, and, although a tidy
person may consume sandwiches and
potato chips and sausages till never a
scrap is left, he can’t do the same with
trotters. The bones, after the flesh has
been gnawed from them, must go some-
where ; in only too many bar-rooms the
floor is the only place for them, and there
they go, along with other partially-con-
sumed provender, cigarette butts and
various odds and ends. The barmen’s
protest was long overdue.
*
“Sero”: There are many instances of
books destined to. become famous
having been refused by the publishers to
whom they were first offered, the error
generally being laid on the shoulders of
some undiscerning publisher’s reader.
The A.M.P. Society, in a little brochure
issued to mark the jubilee of its West-
ralian branch (1884-1934), tells an in-
structive story on the same lines —only
in this case it was a bank and not a
“Y’ clumsy goat! ’Ow d’jer come f knock ’er flamin’ arms orf?”
publishing firm that paid the penalty. In
the late ’eighties the Westralian board of
directors required a trifle of bank accom-
modation, a matter of £2500 for two or
three months only. The W.A. bank de-
clined to oblige.
The account was thereupon withdrawn
and placed with the Bank of New South
Wales. Time has told how costly was this
sacrifice to principles of ultra-conservative
banking practice.
Time has told. The ’Wales swallowed
up the local institution.
* * * *
“Buskin”: Some old memories are
revived by the announcement of the
death of Henry Irving’s widow, at 91. She
married in 1869, and separated from her
husband after 2\ years. She outlived the
tragedian by 29 years, and their two sons
—also actors and producers of distinction
—by over 20 years. Irving’s real name, of
course, was Brodribb, and the Cornish
patronymic which he had discarded was
revived in the Christian names of both
sons. The elder, who once visited Aus-
tralia, was keenly interested in crimin-
ology, and made a special study of mur-
derers. He attended the trial in Perth of
a foundry worker who killed his wife
and buried her under the place in the
yard where he used to eat his lunch.
* * * *
“Mudurup”: Walter Kingsmill had
nearly 38 years of Parliamentary life,
as M.L.A., M.L.C. and Senator, and
during all that time he only twice lost an
election. The first occasion was when
he resigned his State seat to lead a for-
lorn-hope sortie against Labor in the
Senate elections of 1910. Westralian
Labor had established a lien on Senate
seats at that period, and defeat was almost
a foregone conclusion for its oppo-
nents, but Kingsmill’s reverse was a
negligible one in that he was re-elected
to the Leg. Council almost immediately.
In 1922, when he had become President,
his constituents turned him down, mainly,
according to himself, because his job had
precluded him from being sufficient of
a party man for them. Their decision
put him out of politics for a few months
—the only real break in his long term of
service, for he became a Senator at the
end of the year and presently landed an-
other Presidency. But this would have
been his last Parliamentary term any-
way ; the secessionists, to whom he had
refused to truckle, had seen to that.

“D.8.K.”: “G.M.” (B. 11/l/’35)
stresses the need for a fire-alarm which
will discourage the practical joker by
holding him until authority arrives. In
the U.S.A. the problem has been
solved. To set the alarm in action, the
hand and arm must be inserted deeply
into a recess. A leather-lined handcuff
grips the wrist, and to get away it would
be necessary to uproot the whole
structure. When a brigade officer arrives
on the scene it is “0.K., brother,” if the
alarm is a genuine one ; otherwise the
practical joker goes to the nearest police
court.

“Whitehall”: The Bulletin used to
write of the “ladylike lads” of most
English films. One never finds such
references on the Shadow Shows page
nowadays ; yet by general consent there
are more effeminate young men in the
West End theatrical world than at any
time in its history. Modern London
audiences like principal boys of the type
portrayed by Noel Coward in “Design
for Living.” Talkie audiences (i.e.,
world audiences) are different. The
psychologists of Hollywood reasoned this
way about a year ago: “Women are our
chief patrons, and the average woman,
outside the luxury quarters of a few
luxury cities, admires he-men. Ergo,
stop employing the other sort.” Elstree
followed suit, as usual, and British talkie
heroes are now as breezily, beefily
honest (save for an occasional spot of
gentlemanly safe-cracking) as Adelphi
heroes used to be in Bill Terriss’s day.
Briefly, the cynical audiences of London
(Eng.) enjoy seeing life criticised; the
naive audiences of London (Canada)
want to see it sentimentalised.

“Cosmos”: I don’t know if Scottish
Gaelic is or is not a super-language, but
I do know that Rich, L, of the High
Court, was right in calling it “a rapidly
diminishing language.” These figures are
from “The Census of Scotland. Edin-
burgh, 1933” (p. 126): —
Percentage of Population Speaking Gaelic.
1891 6.84
1901 5.57
1911 4.56
1921 3.47
1931 2.97
At the beginning of the century I used to
shoot at Uig in Skye. Then all the crofters
and about 75 p.c. of the inhabitants
of Portree (the chief town of the island,
which one passed through to Uig via
the Kyle of Lochalsh) spoke Gaelic.
Now all the inhabitants of Portree and
about 75 p.c. of the crofters speak Eng-
lish. I know; I drove all over Skye
eight years ago.

“D.”: A lady wrote to the “S. M.
Herald” last week concerning an appal-
ling experience on the Taurus Express.
As the train neared the Bosphorus she
told an American of her eagerness to see
the Dardanelles.
“Why the Dardanelles?” “Because of
the Anzacs,” was the reply. “Because of
what?” “The Anzacs.”
He had never heard of them. The
American
was a nice man about 30 years of age.
He had travelled before, was educated, and
spoke French usefully.
“About 30 years of age”—there you have
it. Men and women of 30 or less are
trying to forget anything they ever knew
about the World War. For every “nice
man about 30 years of age” of any
nationality (including Australian) who
could describe the career of, say, Harry
Murray, you will find 50 capable of de-
scribing the career of Jack Crawford.

“Norbell”: Mention of the elaborate
precautions taken nowadays in the con-
veyance of currency from a bank to its
destination (B. 1/9/’35) sets me think-
ing of the carefree methods of the past.
In Melbourne I have seen scores of boys
of 16 and thereabouts carrying bags con-
taining sometimes thousands of pounds.
These were the very junior clerks of the
various banks who were sent around on
“exchanges”—in those days every bank
issued its own particular brand of bank-
note. Also, I can recall standing in
Hannan-street, Kalgoorlie, in the roaring
’nineties, watching a police-escorted
buggy loading up with bags of money.
The two men in the buggy were
wearing revolver holsters and the
mounted trooper had a carbine. I noticed
a young brother among the on-
lookers, and as he was a bank junior I
asked where the escort was going. “That’s
the fortnightly pay going out to such-
and-such a mine,” he explained, adding
that there was about £l5OO aboard. Then
I asked him what he was doing away
from his bank, “I’m on exchanges,” he
said. “How much have you got in the
bag?” I inquired, “About three thou-
sand,” he told me nonchalantly. No one
was escorting him.

“El V.”: “Fodgie’s” simple conviction
(B. 16/1 /’35) that “every man gives full
expression to his ego when speaking to
his wife” reminds me of Mr. and Mrs.
O’Pannican, my next-door neighbors in
a Queensland mining town. One mid-
night, sounds as of Titans contend-
ing in an iron tank rose from their
dwelling. Michael had come off night-
shift without his pay. The street rallied
hastily to the joust, and we found the de-
voted couple in their kitchen. Michael
was on the floor dragging the table round
with him as a shield. Over him towered
his better-half, arrayed in a pink flannel
nightdress and armed with a light crow-
bar, with which she occasionally prodded
him. At every prod she remarked: “An
phwat wud ye be saying now, ye oma-
dhaun? Shpake before Oi lose me
timper!” Michael’s ego did not seem to
be working very well that night. He
certainly was not expressing it.

“10-2-4” tells of an editorial tragedy:
A former editor, now on the dole, talked
to me of the past as we sat outside his cave
the other day. His paper specialised then, as
now, in national self-sufficiency—as the man-
aging director called it, Orstrylyunism. Before
becoming editor my friend wrote a leader which
still appears, with slight modifications, every
week or so —an affirmation of the capacity of
Australians to lick the earth at anything. Aus-
tralians, as typified by the “Whoop’s” readers,
were represented as supreme in war, sport, art
and literature, the social graces.
Obviously nothing was too good for them.
A young Oxonian who had met several Diggers
in England as a child was commissioned to
write on Australian Defence. Lloyd George,
Ramsay MacDonald, Lady Oxford, Snowden,
Churchill, Noel Coward and Mary Pickfqrd
contributed syndicated memoirs. English
policemen wrote about Scotland Yard, English
astronomers about the stars, English meterqlo-
gists about the weather, English metallurgists
about mining, English deans about everything.
Fourteen English tennis players sold the
“Whoop” and its associates their views qn
tennis, and a visiting Yankee golf pro. dis-
cussed Australian golfers in 12 penetrating
articles a week after his arrival. Every Aus-
tralian daily recognised that the “Whoop” had
secured a scoop of scoops when, in common
with 768 other periodicals, British and Ameri-
can, it bought the right to publish “Racing,
by a Former Trainer to His Majesty the King”
in twenty-seven 2000-word instalments.
It was at this stage that the editor made a
bloomer which is still talked of dazedly by
Australian journalists. He bought a series of
articles on Australian journalism by an Aus-
tralian journalist.
His directors were divided as to whether he
had turned anti-British or gone prematurely
gaga. In either event the insult to the
“Whoop’s” readers called for drastic action;
in addition to being sacked, my friend was
blacklisted.
His articles, having been bought, had to be
used. They appeared as “Thoughts on the
Australian Press by an English K.C.”
TO A POTATO.
“Fishmongers waited on the Federal Minister for
Health with a request for the removal of the embargo
on M.L. potatoes on the ground that it was killing
the flsh-and-chips industry.”
Historic product of some Chilian valley,
Tuber in nutriment so rarely rich,
To Britain brought by good old Walter Raleigh
Or Drake or Hawkins (I’ve forgotten which).
Acclaimed an indispensable addition
For centuries to divers sorts of “chow,”
We never realised your real mission,
It almost seems, till now.
In Erin’s isle, unless I’m much mistaken,
With buttermilk ’tis yours to coalesce
And blend, as pleasantly as eggs with bacon,
And fraternise, as mustard does with cress.
And there, albeit oft they ate you single,
They were the first, I’ll bet a bob or two,
To find how admirably you commingle
With onions in a stew.
You are the squire upon Sir Loin attending
Or owning Leg o’ Mutton for your lord,
For ever like a loyal servant lending
Your aid to either on the festive board.
With roasted meats and boiled alike you’re
mated,
With baked you click, as surely as with
hashed;
And how would salad fare without you (grated)
Or sausage miss you (mashed)!
The Continental chef who doesn’t know some
New way to serve you’s counted up to mud,
My excellent Solarium tuberosum
Or, more colloquially, Mister Spud.
Both high and low award you
winning brackets;
What jaded appetites you’ve
templed, fried!
And, hot from midnight piestalls
in your jackets,
What chinks you’ve filled in-
side !
This prohibition biz, my friend,
a weight is
On all our backs. You’ll find,
where’er you turn,
Agreement that the soaring price
of praties
Is matter for immediate con-
cern.
Is Reason fled? Has Justice gone
a mucker?
Here is the thing that counts,
the point that grips:
With you so dear and little chance of succor.
How can they live —the coves who make their
tucker
By vending fish-and-chips?

T. THE R.


“Selma”: Maoriland, albeit a moral
country for these times, goes in for a
species of nudism. The Rachel swim-
ming bath, large enough to accom-
modate a hundred bathers, is at all times
immensely popular with visitors to
Rotorua, who spend hours in the warm,
beautifying water. No bather is permitted
to wear any kind of costume in the public
baths, the underlying idea being to pre-
vent anyone with a skin trouble —private
baths are provided for such —from
mingling with the Rachel bathers. Men
and women have separate swimming
baths, but they are close enough to make
a through-the-wall conversation possible
in quiet moments. I was once stunned
to hear a masculine voice inquiring in a
normal tone if I found the water unpleas-
antly hot. It was a solitary tourist dis-
porting himself next door.
“Ex-Second”; Say this for Monash.
Until he took over the Australian Corps,
our infantry never had a fair deal in
the allocation of rest areas. Tired bat-
talions were invariably poked away into
the most isolated camps and villages to
recuperate. Monash changed this within
24 hours ; thereafter we billeted as com-
fortably as the Guards Division.
* * * *
“Dun Dhu”: There is another serious
objection to the dressing of Australian
battalions in kilts (B. 9/1 / ’35). The pleats
are gathered in folds at the waist, and
form a thick belt, doubly thick at the
back. Hence the health of its wearers will
be threatened by periodic changes from
kilt to civilian clothes, and chills affecting
the kidneys will be of frequent occur-
rence. This is not theory ; it happened
during the war to scores of men com-
“No, no, No! Tenors carry on till we come to ‘The Gates of Hell’; then you
all come in ”
missioned from the ranks of Highland
battalions to unkilted regiments. The
glengarry is also a totally unsuitable head-
covering for our climate. It is hot, un-
hygienic and useless for keeping the sun
out of the wearer’s eyes.
* * * *
“Histor”: The Saar, of course, has
always been racially Teutonic, whoever
may have ruled it, but it is worth noting
that the most distinguished man it ever
produced was essentially French, and left
a striking name in French history. This
was Michel Ney, born at Saarlouis in
1769, destined to become one of Napo-
leon’s marshals and to be hailed by
Boney as “the bravest of the brave.
Never more impressive than in defeat,
he saved his remnant of the Grand Army
in the retreat from Moscow, and at
Waterloo he commanded in person the
last charge of the Old Guard. The loss of
the battle meant more to Ney than to
Napoleon himself, for before 1815 was
out the Marshal had been found guilty
of high treason and shot. He might have
confounded the cowardly Bourbonists
who thirsted for his blood by pleading
that he was a Saarlander, but when this
was suggested to him by his counsel he
refused.
* * * *
“Norbell” : So Melbourne has resumed
bathing in the Yarra (B. 9/1 /’35). When
I was a kid all the youngsters from Rich-
mond up to Abbotsford and beyond
utilised it for this purpose. I learnt to
swim in the Yarra at Hawthorn, and a
gang of us bathed there regularly until
one morning when the horribly bloated
body of a drowned man drifted among
us. It proved to be the corpse of a Haw-
thorn resident who had often roared us
up for daring to swim past his garden.
* * * *
“Old Lag”: Documents recently dis-
covered in Government libraries in
Canada and the U.S.A. show that Aus-
tralia has entertained more angels than
many have realised. The evidence, un-
earthed by. Professor Scott, of Melbourne,
shows that scores of participants in
minor rebellions in Canada in 1837-39
were shipped to Australia. Most of the
ringleaders, including Americans who had
crossed the border to join the rebels,
were hanged ; Sir George Arthur, who
had been Governor of Van Diemen’s
Land, let the remainder off with trans-
portation to N.S.W. and V.D.L. There
were 141 on the bill of lading. Of these
68 French-Canadians were landed at Syd-
ney, the balance going on to Tassie. Free
pardons were granted to all survivors in
1844, and all save one returned to North
America. He settled in Hobart.
* * * *
“Chymist”: “Demonax” (B. 5/12/’34)
shows little knowledge of his- subject
when he asserts that airtight rubber
clothing would be an absolute safeguard
against poison gas. Carbon dioxide, to
cite one common gas, passes through
rubber as through a sieve, and for this
reason rubber may not be used in any
part of a gas-analysis apparatus with
which the gases come in contact. It is
only necessary to examine rubber after
immersion in petrol to realise its vul-
nerability to chemical attack. If the
stuff isn’t proof against these innocuous
substances, what protection would it be
likely to afford against deadly gases?
* * * *
“Claymore”: “El V.” might have
qualified his statement that the Second
Battalion of the Black Watch (the 73rd)
was the first British regiment to come to
Australia by adding that the 73rd
was a separate unit until Cardwell intro-
duced the linked battalion system in the
early ’seventies. Prior to that the Black
Watch was known as the 42nd, and every
other regiment in the service, with the
exception of the Household units and the
cavalry, was known by its number. The
practical abolition of these and the sub-
stitution of territorial designations roused
bitter antagonism in the service. The
Black Watch was originally a military
police force raised after—not before —
Culloden to police the subdued Highlands
“I thought you said your new gown was backless.”
“So it- Quick !My cloak ! I’ve got it on back to front.”
and enforce disarmament and the ban on
the Highland dress. Most of its enlist-
ments were from the ranks of broken
young men of good family who might
otherwise have found shelter in some
Continental army, and a special tartan
was invented for it. In saying the regi-
ment is the oldest Scottish formation in
the British service barring the Royal
Scots and the third Foot Guards, “El
V.” forgets the Scots Greys. This regi-
ment gained renown under Marlborough
long before the “Forty-twa.”
* * *
“Rod”: The fact that a
, Melbourne police recruit
unused to firearms killed
a comrade while fiddling
with an automatic pistol he
had been given to hold is
a reminder that, even to
those accustomed to breech-
loading guns, rifles and re-
volvers, automatics can be
unchancy things. One
South African instance
occurs to me. Plumer’s
column was in camp,
and one of his staff
officers had given his bat-
man a Mauser pistol to
clean. The man had never
seen one before—auto-
matics were then as rare as
unwatered rum in the ser-
vice—and he had hardly
handled it when he sent a
bullet through his boss’s
tent. As he staggered back
in horror, still clutching the
thing, another shot whizzed
down the staff lines, and
then another and another
as the now hysterical man
tried vainly to quell his
Frankenstein monster. To
us Australians standing near by the fren-
zied scuttle of the gilded staff in all direc-
tions was a delightful scene.
$ * * *
“Filmite”; Laugh if you will at such
parodies on the baroque as the
Splendiferous Theatre, but you must
admit that the designers of these
architectural monstrosities were busi-
nessmen. The Modesta had an aston-
ishingly good bill recently, yet on the
night I attended it was half empty. On
the same night a friend was at the Splen-
diferous and found it full. Pure snobbish-
ness! Film audiences are largely com-
posed of women whose seats are paid for
by male relatives or friends. To 90 p.c.
of women the Splendiferous represents
lavishness, wealth and consequently de-
sirability ; the Modesta, though its seats
are comfortable and its acoustics are
particularly good, stands for economy —
that blight on everything spacious and
free. To most women the interior deco-
rations of the Splendiferous are not fan-
tastically hideous ; they would ask no-
thing better than to live among them,
So they emerge satisfied even when the
show is indifferent. Few men have the
nerve to take ladies who think the Splen-
diferous beautiful to the Modesta, even
when both its films are excellent. It
looks too much like home.
“Eck de Sulzbach”: The practice of
blood transfusion is intimately connected
with the typing of the blood into groups
(B. 9/1/ ’35). Fatalities which were once
risked by blood transfusion are now
easily avoided by finding the blood group
of both patient and donor before the
transfusion. Pepys in his Diary gives an
account of the first attempt at blood
transfusion, which was tried on Arthur
Coga, a half-mad Cambridge graduate,
“that is poor and a debauched man that
the college have hired for 20s. to have
some of the blood of a sheep let into his
body. Some think it may have a good
effect on him as a frantic man by cooling
his blood.” Coga declared afterwards
that he felt a new man, but Pepys records
that he remained “cracked a little in the
head.”
- * * *
“Inaha”: In spite of the world-wide
use of petrol, fires and explosions due to
its employment near a naked flame con-
tinue to occur with monotonous regu-
larity. Nowadays even a child knows
the consequences of lighting a match to
look for a gas-leak, but mechanics still
light matches over the fuel-tanks of cars,
and trusting housewives still use the stuff
for cleansing clothes while a fire blazes
a yard or two away. Those who must
use petrol should remember its extreme
volatility, the small percentage of vapor
needed to form a highly-explosive mix-
ture with air, and, above all, the heavy
density of the vapor, which enables it
to travel as far as 40ft. from the liquid
while remaining an ignitable and explo-
sive gas.

“Europa” on gigolos:
Hitler, says a Berlin cable, has “banned
gigolos as derogatory to masculine dignity.”
What difference is there in principle be-
tween a man who lives on a woman’s income
in or out of wedlock? Before the war titled
German men had raised the practice of marry-
ing foreigners (chiefly Americans) for their
money to the status of an industry; and
it still goes on to an extent.
At one stage in Australia’s history almost
every indigent young R.N. officer and A.D.C.
was prepared to become a married gigolo if
the (financially) right girl came along. Those
who brought it off didn’t sacrifice their “mas-
culine dignity.” A sign-manual of the gigolo,
married or otherwise, is an arrogance which is
rarely found in the lover or husband who
works. The gigolo-fancier’s income accrues to
the gigolo with the lady, and she is quickly
made to accept this old-established rule and
behave with due humility. If she doesn’t,
the true gigolo will soon find somebody else
with money who will be more considerate of
his manly pride.
Germany, as several of the novels of the
authoress of “Elizabeth and her German
Garden” indicate, is a home of gigolos, mar-
ried and otherwise, but there, as elsewhere,
the gigolo is nothing if not aggressively digni-
fied. The only people whose dignity stands
in need of protection anywhere are the moneyed
females whose folly makes the gigolo’s calling
so lucrative, and hence popular.
WINDOW LADY.
Sweet lady of the window.
With your Mona Lisa smile,
A mystery —inviting me
To linger for a while?
Or mocking me for what I am.
Mere unit of the crowd?
What do you seek? Why never speak
Your Sphinx-like thoughts aloud?
Sweet lady, at the window
Each day I see you stand,
If cold, or warm, or raging storm
Goes sweeping o’er the land,
Sometimes in flimsy silken frock,
Sometimes unblushingly
Revealing there to vulgar stare
Your dainty lingerie.
Sweet lady in the window,
I even passed one day.
And, without guile, that baffling smile
Was your entire array!
Yet you returned my ardent gaze
Serenely as before,
Sweet waxen model lady in
The window of a store!

POLITICAL POINTS
The Melbourne Government is now
forbidding N.S.W. and S.A. owners of
taxis and commercial vehicles to enter
Victoria unless they take out Victorian
licenses. It is alleged to be “a move to
secure reciprocity,” but it seems rather
to be a reprisal for the Sydney Govern-
ment’s veto on Victorian motor-lorries
carrying goods into N. S. Wales. In each
case the Riverina is the principal suf-
ferer. Nature made it one of the most
favored parts of Australia, but Sydney
and Melbourne politicians and public
servants seem to think people ought to
be punished for living there.
A few days before the Saarlanders
voted 10 to 1 for reunion with Germany,
Egon Kisch, broadcasting from the Syd-
ney Labor station, described the German
workers as “prisoners, serfs or con-
scripts,” and “exhorted all workers to
drive Hitler out of Germany.” Aus-
tralians beg to be excused. Let Egon
do it!
After all, Victoria is to have the first
of the three State elections due this year.
Starting up out of a long sleep, Argyle
murmured “March the second,” and
then rolled over again. In the House that
will not meet again there were 29
U.A.Ps., 17 U.C.Ps., 16 Laborites and
three Independents. The U.A.P, will
lose seats to Labor, but there is no sign
of the landslide that would be necessary
to propel Tunnecliffe into the Premier-
ship,
Bruce has arranged for the conversion
of another lot of Australian 5 per cents,
totalling £22,384,000, to p.c,, issued at
par. It will mean another annual saving
of £490,000 in interest and exchange, and
the Commonwealth, with £17,355,000 to
be converted, will benefit most, though
all the States, except N.S.W., will share.
N.S.W.’s turn will come before long; it
has £21,657,000 (5 p.c.) and £10,954,600
(44 p.c.) on the optional-redemption list
this year.
Westralians are wondering why the
name of P. J. Lynch, President of the
Senate, was left off the New Year
“honors” list. Two Nat. predecessors,
Newlands and Kingsmill, were both
knighted (Newlands got a K.C.M.G. nine
months after his appointment), but there
has been nothing for Lynch, although he
has held the office since August 31, 1932.
Probably he retains his old democratic
hostility to titles, as did Givens, also an
Irishman, with whom he left the Labor
party when it turned against national
service.
Drummond, the N.S.W. Minister for
Education, is at work on a bill to con-
solidate and strengthen half a dozen de-
fective measures relating to children and
young persons. He admits that, although
the Child Welfare Department has “a
considerable number of mentally defec-
tive male and female children” nomi-
nally under its care, it has “no effective
means of controlling them,” particularly
if they have turned 18. In fact, the elder
girls may marry and bring more human
refuse into the world.
A dispute over chain stores nearly led
to a split in the Canadian Cabinet. The
quarrel has been composed, and legisla-
tion to regulate chain stores has been
introduced. Australians will watch its
progress in the hope that their country
may profit by Canada’s example.
In road accidents last year 7273 Britons
were killed and 231,698 injured. This is
staggering, but perhaps Adelaide’s record
of one fatal motor accident a week is
really worse. The grim record comes
from the City Coroner’s office, and the
Adelaide Local Court heard 41 motor-
accident cases out of 157 actions of all
kinds.
The widow of Alexander Peacock, who
succeeded him as M.L.A. for Allandale,
is not going up for re-election. She says
“representing a country constituency is a
man’s job” ; and so it is, though Miss
Holman, of Westralia, protests that she
has represented a country constituency
for nearly 10 years. The trouble is that
city and suburban constituencies in which
women predominate won’t have women
as members. Even in cases where they
have tried them —and there have been
four —they have rejected them after one
term.
No N.S.W, countryman who has had
to wander about Sydney trying to find
departments which are housed in all
sorts of places will object to the erection
of new Government buildings in Phillip
and Bridge streets, even if they cost
£lBO,OOO, as proposed. Interest and sink-
ing-fund payments should come to less
than the present outlay on rents. And
one blot on the city landscape will dis-
appear —the hideous corrugated iron
building which shelters the Government
Architect, of all people.
At a time when some unions are be-
ginning to squander the little money they
have in idiotic
strikes, the achieve-
ment of the N. S.
Wales Storemen
and Packers de-
serves notice. De-
pression and chain
stores have hit
them hard, and
their membership
has fallen nearly
2000 since the
boom days. Never-
theless they have
saved £525 p.a.
since 1924, and
have £5875—£1
12s. 6d. per finan-
cial memb e r—
tucked away for a
rainy day.
Walter Kings-
mill, dead last
week, did not
stand at the late
election, but could
have remained a
Senator till June
30 had he lived.
Under Clause 15 of
the Constitution
the Westralian
Governor, on the
advice of the
Executive Council, may appoint a
successor till McDonald, who was
elected in Kingsmill’s place, is en-
titled to take his seat, and some “com-
rade” may get the billet for five months
or so. It will be rather ridiculous, but
there are precedents, and in these matters
Labor Governments never throw away
a point.
J. H. Thomas must still have admirers
in England, though they are not con-
spicuous in Ireland or the Dominions. A
few years ago the British railway unions
raised £lO,OOO for him by a penny sub-
scription. He took that, but when his
constituents gave him £2250 to mark
his silver jubilee in Parliament he handed
it back for distribution among charities.
Trams are going out of fashion in
Britain, though they still cumber the
narrow streets of Sydney, where the
motor-’bus is subordinated to them. In
Britain last year tramway passenger-
journeys decreased by 60 millions,
whereas trolley-’bus passenger-journeys
increased by 92 millions. Since 1932 24
tramway undertakings have been
scrapped, motor- and trolley-’bus services
having been substituted in 19 cases, and
24 local ■ authorities are now running
trolley-’buses. Australia has about
£26,000,000 invested in tramways, all
humorously included in the list of “per-
manent and reproductive works.”
Melbourne City Council is selling off
all the flags used for decorations during
the centenary shivoo, reserving only the
hammer and sickle of the Soviet. Why it
declines to sell the red banner has,not
been explained, and old ladies are uneasy
in their minds. It is provided in the
French Constitution that the Mayor of
Paris must not make himself dictator of
the country. Victoria has no such safe-
guard.
B. J. McKenna, Queensland’s Director
of Education, and Dr. Tillyard, Canberra’s
pocket champion, have figured in a brisk
argument about ’Berra, McKenna started
it by saying it would be waste of money
to put a university in “a little poky, out-
of-the-way place” like ’Berra. The doctor
warmly retorted that it was immeasur-
ably superior to a stuffy hole like Bris-
bane, which he never visited without
almost sweating to a shadow. The Mc-
Kenna came back to the effect that
’Berra owed its miserable existence to the
rivalry of Melbourne and Sydney, and
in lauding it Dr. Tillyard had “taken
wing with some of his insects.” The
Association for the Advancement of
“In sincere flattery of President Roosevelt, Lloyd George is
out with a New Deal for Britain.”
“S’pose there’s no joker in this pack, L.-G.?”
“Dinna ye ken that he’s the joker?”
Science interrupted the shindy by con-
ferring the Mueller medal on the doctor
for “his work on insects, recent and
fossil” —meaning nothing derogatory to
McKenna.
There will be a great pilgrimage to
London this year. It will include Lyons,
Pearce (or Gullett), Menzies and
Stewart; a happy band of Common-
wealth officers; Butler and party from
Adelaide ; Hartigan, the N.S.W. Railway
Commissioner, and as many more as can
manage it. Stewart’s position is unique—
he is paying his own expenses.
Of all Australia’s legion of legislators
the Westralian M.L.C. has the softest
snap. Even in these days he gets £538
p.a., together with postage, the run of a
comfortable club and library, and free
passes over the Government railways of
Australia and M.L. and the Perth tram-
ways. Constituents rarely worry him, he
hasn’t to bother his head about roads
or bridges, and he is not expected to take
part in elections other than his own. They
come at intervals of six years, and re-
election is neither difficult nor expensive.
The “work” averages about 20 sittings
p.a., which rarely extend beyond 10 p.m.
And, “though threatened oft,” like Dry-
den’s milk-white hind, the House seems
“fated not to die.”
One J. H. Barker, formerly manager
of Western Electric, quoted by a Sydney
film magazihe:
It is not realised in America how close
the motion-picture industry is to the Gov-
ernment in Australia, and how readily
complaints aimed at quota restrictions and
the like can get a hearing in important
places.
It should be realised in Australia. The
report of the Film Commission which the
N.S.W. Government appointed at Mr.
Stuart Doyle’s request last year costs 11s.
to buy. Heaven alone knows what it
costs to produce.
Queensland politicians are interestedly
discussing the case of a police constable,
Daly, who, recently retired on pension as
physically unfit, wants to become the
Labor candidate for Warwick. A pen-
sioned policeman may be recalled to the
force at any time if his services are
thought to be required ; then if Mr. Daly
drew his pension while a candidate he
might be regarded as holding an office
of profit under the Crown. In West-
ralia a detective (Harry Mann) became a
State member, but he resigned from the
C.I.D. first. And John Forrest was an
Imperial pensioner during his long career
in two Parliaments. It never prevented
his standing or drawing his salary as
member, but he turned the pension in
when in office.
Bishop Burgmann, of Goulburn, is
again warning wage-payers that dreadful
things will happen to them if they don’t
listen to him.
If the bourgeois class will not take the
working class into a real partnership, the
latter will seek its ends by the pursuit of
power, and the power is with the workers
of the world.
What does the gentleman mean by a real
partnership? Profit-sharing? It has been
tried in Australia, and the unions fell on
the triers like tons of chain. And why,
in his outpourings of advice to Austra-
lians, does the bishop talk the cant of
Marxism? There is neither “prole-
tariat” nor “bourgeoisie” here.
Knight Douglas Mawson, in his presi-
dential address at Melbourne to the
Association for the Advancement of
Science;
Since 1905 more than 300,000 whales,
yielding products valued at £70,000,000,
have been taken in Antarctic waters.
By Norwegians mostly.
Within 1320 miles of Hobart lies prob-
ably the richest whaling region in the world.
But Australians and Maorilanders are
not working it. Mawson reminds them
forcibly of this neglect; he tells them
also that they ought to be establishing
shore posts, whence they may broadcast
weather reports and collect “seal and
fish products and penguin eggs,” and
going in for fur-farming—“abundance of
food is available at no cost.”
Addressing the Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, Leicester Webb,
lecturer in political science at the Uni-
versity of M.L., drew a dismal picture of
deterioration in M.L. political life. Be-
tween 1854 and 1871, he said, fewer than
5 p.c. of the Cabinet Ministers had only
elementary educations; between 1911
and 1931 more than 40 p.c. were thus
handicapped. He omitted to mention
that in the first period no working man
—in the widest sense—-could afford to
become a member of Parliament; in
any case, his inference is unconvincing.
Some of the ablest men we have had in
Australian politics could boast no more
than a primary schooling. It was the
same with Lincoln.

Chairmanship of S.A, State Savings
Bank, rendered vacant by the death of
Herbert Phillipps at 87, goes to Joseph
Randle, a mere youth of 71. He has
been a trustee for nearly 30 years. Out-
side business hours, he is a tireless
bowler.
Rev. Charles L’Oste, who died in Tas.
the other day at 106, didn’t hold Aus-
tralia’s record for longevity. Harry
Moore, a Port Melb. negro, who died a
few years back, was 108. His papers
showed that he was accepted by the
British navy in the West Indies 94 years
before his death.
Note from “Bouverie S.”:
Lord Riddell, who has left over a million
and three-quarters sterling—an astonishing pro-
portion to employees and institutions for the
benefit of pressmen—was England’s John
Norton. He ran the “News of the World” for
sensation-lovers, with no humbug about being
a moralist out to expose infamy for the public
good, and he was rewarded with what must
be the largest fortune ever made by a weekly
paper. Like Norton, Riddell wrote volumin-
ously, and had a political mind, but he lacked
John’s odd preoccupation with religion. He
was the complete cynic by temperament, and
he had the fleering voice and cold Voltairean
smile that suited the part. Because he never
canted London took him to its heart, and his
generous will shows that he deserved all the
affection bestowed on him.
Dead in Adelaide suddenly, at 62, V.
E. R. Dumas, who, as Registrar-General
of Deeds, administered the Torrens Act

dent of many civil-service boards.

SIR EYRE HUTSON in search of the sun.
an old northern pastoral family which
did much pioneering, both in the
country below the Toowoomba range
and in the north-west. He has twice
tried politics, and has twice decided
that he doesn’t like the atmosphere.
His favorite sport is lion-hunting. A cer-
tain lion regarded him as the game,
which was one reason why he wasn’t
among the first to enlist in the World
War. He managed to get away later, and
did his bit in Africa. At one stage in his
life his beard and walk made him look
like the twin of Hubert Wilkins.
“Kerry”: The Bulletin remarked in
a par. about the Catholic Archbishop of
Liverpool that many Irishmen had
Spanish blood in their veins. Captain
F- G- Cadiz (formerly of the Narkunda),
who has been forgathering with other
ex-commanders of the P. and O. line in
Melbourne, is a case in point. The ori-
ginal Cadiz was a Castilian who married
an Irish girl in the seventeenth century.
A De Zulueta married into the Sheil
family of Dublin, and Da Nobregas,
Gogorzas and many other possessors of
famous Spanish names have wedded
girls of Irish descent.
“Pasara” on an eminent Australian:
Just 35 years ago Wilfred White, of Williams-
town (Vic,), left for the U.S.A., where (with
Lord Kelvin) he established Kelvin and White,
manufacturers, designers and suppliers of navi-
gational instruments. The U.S. Navy obtains
a good deal of its navigational requirements
from the firm; the three Matson liners, Mari-
posa, Monterey and Lurline, are installed with
its equipment, and its Australian expert fitted
out the Roosevelt, which Peary used in his
North Pole expedition. Grahame White, in his
first flight, used a special compass (the first ever
used in aviation) that had been designed and
constructed by W. O. White.
“Melb.”: There has been much specu-
lation lately as to what honor Governor-
General Isaacs will get on retirement.
He is already a G.C.M.G., so it should
be nothing less than a baronetcy, and
Canberra, where he and his wife are
popular, can see no objection to a peer-
age. He is richer than most modern
peers, and there is the precedent of John
Forrest, of W.A., who did no more for
Australia, all said and done, than Isaacs
has done as M.L.A., M.H.R., Attorney-
General (State and Federal), High Court
Judge and finally Federal C.J. His vice-
regal career has been freer of awkward
incidents than that of any previous G.-G.
who has had to face troublous times —
a tribute to his shrewd old lawyer’s
brain and to his poker-faced refusal to
be diverted from his chosen course by
the tactics of opponents.
Here is Sir Eyre
Hutson, as seen by
Frith on the arrival
of the Ormonde
last week. Sir Eyre,
who was often in
Sydney when Gov-
ernor of Fiji and
High Commis-
sioner for the Wes-
tern Pacific, made
the mistake of re-
visiting his old
haunts this summer
in the hope of see-
ing some sunshine.
He might have
achieved his aim
in Jamaica, Ber-
muda, Barbados or
British Guiana, in
all of which places
he has held offi-
cial positions since
first entering the
Colonial Service
half a century ago.
But, no ; he must
pick on Sydney at
its wettest. He
means to stay for
a month unless
washed out.
Andrew Hodge, formerly proprietor
of the Queenscliff (Vic.) “Sentinel,” has
just celebrated his ninetieth birthday in
Melbourne. Hodge was a journalist of
imagination. His office was the usual
weatherboard, one-storey country news-
paper headquarters, but on his letter-
heads he used an old block of the Flat-
iron Building, New York, and beneath
it the title “Offices of the Queenscliff
‘Sentinel.’ ” When Kitchener occupied
Khartoum in the Sudan War, Hodge
persuaded the local council to rise on
the wave of loyalty which swept Victoria
and vote a round sum for the purchase
of a sword of honor to be presented to
the general, and sent a big report of the
great happenings to the Melbourne press.
Of course, the council discovered, within
a day or two, that it had no power to
vote ratepayers’ money for swords of
honor, but Hodge succeeded in his
object: he got Queenscliff publicity.
Henry Hanke’s Archibald Prize win
(valued at £390 this year) was a drama-
tic affair. On the day he learned of
his success he had drawn £2 9s. lOd. for
a fortnight’s relief work. In addition
to being the first
relief worker, he is
the first N. S.
Wales artist to lift
the prize. (George
Lambert, though
he began and
ended his career in
Sydney, was a cos-
mopolitan, born in
Russia, trained
largely in Paris,
and an A.R.A.)
Hanke was born in
Hunter’s Hill 34
years ago, and lives
and works there.
He is a motor
mechanic, and
dealt in cars till
the slump came,
when he turned to
other means of
supporting his wife
and two children.
Repairing tennis
racquets for one.

looking fighter,

body encased in

Victoria and M.L. might both claim
Isaac Isaacs, dead in Adelaide at 76, for
he was born in Melbourne, had 25 years
in Christchurch, and, back in Victoria,
was Grand President of Druids. He moved
to S.A. in 1899. There his financial
genius soon made him chairman of the
City Council’s finance committee; he
was Mayor for two strenuous war years
and an alderman till his death. Also he
was prominent in Masonry, the Lib. Fed-
eration, the A.N.A., the Justices’ Asso-
ciation and many Hebrew charities.
Blamire Young, who has died in Mel-
bourne at 72, became an artist owing to
the encouragement given him by Phil
May nearly 50 years ago. Young had
only recently arrived at a Katoomba
school from England as mathematics
master when Phil —then The Bulletin’s
chief cartoonist —became interested in his
drawings, and offered to teach him.
Schoolmastering had never appealed to
Young, and when a chance came in 1893
to return to England and engage in paint-
ing as a whole-time job he took it. He
began with Harry Weston and Lionel
and Norman Lindsay as a poster-de-
signer on his return to Australia. After-
wards he held successful one-man shows,
wrote admirably about art and the
theatre, became interested in the Reper-
tory movement and had several plays
produced by Repertorians. An intensely
patriotic Briton, he abandoned his pro-
fession during the war and served as a
musketry instructor.
T. H. Fitzgerald is coming from Bris-
bane to manage the head Sydney office
of the E., S. and A. Bank. He joins a
select coterie of Queenslanders in high
banking positions—Bell and Peter Tait on
the Commonwealth Board, Davidson and
Hilder of the ’Wales, Moreton, from
Maryborough, in charge of the E., S.
and A.’s important branch at the Hay-
market, Sydney, among them. Fitz-
gerald’s grandfather was the first settler
in the Innisfail district (N.Q.), and the
town was originally named Geraldton
after him. When it found a rival in
Geraldton (W.A.) the name was changed
to that of the Fitzgerald plantation.
From an old friend:
Walter Kingsmill, though he didn’t enter
Parliament until he was 33, looked like a man
who was bound to go to the top. The son of
H. HANKE, Archibald Prize winner, 1935.
a S. Aus. pastoralist, he swept the board of
prizes at St. Peter’s, Adelaide, and graduated
at the University before qualifying as a mining
engineer. The newly-enfranchised Pilbarra elec-
torate sent him to the Westralian Assembly,
after he had been mining registrar on that re-
mote goldfield, and he was not long in making
his mark as a capable speaker and a man with
a wide knowledge of Australian affairs. He
held office twice under George Leake, but on
Leake’s death in 1902, though it fell to him as
senior Minister to form a new Government, he
was obliged to yield top place to a man from
outside, Walter James. A few years later he
had dropped out of the fighting line and was
contenting himself with less precarious and less
strenuous Parliamentary jobs—he was Chair-
man of Committees for 13 years in the Leg.
Council and President for another three. The
latter position he might have filled until his
death if he hadn’t lost his seat as a member,
but the loss was only a stepping-stone to the
Senate, where his comprehensive knowledge of
Parliamentary procedure led to his being elected
President a few years ago. A Westralian col-
league in Senator Patrick Lynch succeeded him.
There were few more graceful and logical
speakers in Australia than Kingsmill, and he
was incapable of bitterness or rancor. He
was a keen fisherman, he had studied Aus-
tralian natural history as closely as the classics
in his school days, and had done some valuable
acclimatisation work. During the war he took
over control of the Perth Zoological Gardens
as an honorary job.
“D.”; From a syndicated English
article: —-
Seldom in the history of the prize-ring
has a fight caused more excitement than
the battle fought on May 12, 1808, between
John Gully, later Speaker of the House of
Commons, and Robert Gregson.
The pug didn’t become Speaker, though
his son did. I often used to see William
Court Gully, M.P., walking between the
Commons and his home in Buckingham
Gate when I was a boy. He was a hand-
some and efficient Speaker in the ’nine-
ties, but he fell foul of the Irish members
through no fault of his own. He left
regretfully for the Lords when he took
his seat as Viscount Selby.

“Heritage”
In making this picture, which was pre-
shown at Sydney Mayfair on Sunday
night, Charles Chauvel had several alter-
natives. He might have satirised the im-
becilities of his eras, and gilded the pills
with appeals to the moron emotions, ac-
cording to the “Cavalcade” formula. Or
he might have sentimentalised the thing
lock, stock and barrel in the manner of
Hollywood’s covered-waggon films. In-
stead, he has shown two conventional
love stories, with Australia’s 147 years
of history for background, sticking, as
historian, to the adage “Boost; don’t
knock.”
Franklyn Bennett is the pioneer hero
—handsome, upstanding, the possessor of
a resonant Voice and foreshadowings of
the still unborn Australian accent. He
takes his bride, Margot Rhys, to the
western plains, makes good, returns to
Sydney and luxury, and sees his only
son go off to face similar hardships in
the Never-Never. It ends with a patriotic
speech at Canberra, beefed out with
tremendous energy by the pioneer’s
grandson (Mr. Bennett again), who has
fallen in love with a pioneer’s grand-
daughter.
The acting is stagy, on the whole;
there is too much talk, and a lot of it is
stilted and platitudinous. We see Philip
—admirably played by Frank Harvey—
Macquarie, Greenway receiving the in-
evitable building orders from his vice-
regal friend, Wentworth making the in-
evitable speech; but no Macarthur,
Lawson, Blaxland, Robertson, Martin,
Parkes. We never get the impression
that this is a- convict colony, in which
chain gangs, floggings and public execu-
tions are everyday affairs. The women
who arrive on the convict ship—presum-
ably the Lady Penrith —don’t look like
the offscourings of London; they are
nice girls. Towards the end the film be-
comes largely a gazette revealing the
progress of Australia —the Sydney bridge,
great city buildings, more and more
flocks and herds.
Despite its weaknesses, attributable
largely to the fact that we are too near
convict times for the truth to be told,
“Heritage” is an achievement —by far
the best film that has been made in Aus-
tralia. The outdoor sequences are lovely,
and the camera-work is worthy of them ;
Agnes Doyle in “Nice Goings On,” at
Sydney Cri.
the period dresses and furnishings look
right, and the crowds are convincingly
handled. The film is likely to interest
all Australians in its present form, and,
with a few of the shots of local indus-
tries and all the publicity experts’ cap-
tions excised, it ought to interest thou-
sands of foreigners.
“Jew Suss”
Feuchtwanger’s tale of Wiirtemberg two
centuries ago has Rabelaisian breadth,
some depth of psychological insight and
the sort of perspective that can be given
by a dry manner of narration —Feuchl-
wanger is ironic. British-Gaumont’s ver-
sion of “Jew Suss” is melodramatic.
Conrad Veidt is Josef Suss Oppenheimer.
So long as he remains sardonic, imper-
turbable, he fits the picture. He wears
clothes well; he sits a horse well; he can
be sauve or arrogant in equally high
degree. But when he discovers his
daughter, dead in the garden, the victim
of Duke Alexander’s idea of gentle-
manly sport, he knuckles his ears in the
manner of distraught heroines; babbles
incoherently; rolls on the ground caress-
ing the body; abandons himself to a
welter of grief. And when he goes to
see his mother, to receive the news that
he really isn’t a Jew, but a high-born
Phil Smith in “Nice Goings On.”
Gentile’s by-blow, he picks the old lady
up and dandles her in his arms, kissing
her with the ardency and frequency
appropriate to a lover and his, lass.
Despite these peculiarities and some
rather weak acting in subsidiary roles,
the film has its moments. The execution
scene, in drifting snow, though enacted
with a monotonously mechanical mob,
has strength, and the whole thing
abounds in effective tableaux. Seen at
a preview at Film House, Sydney.
“British Agent”
Watching this film at Sydney Regent,
present critic was impressed more than
ever before by Hollywood’s odd respect
for modern melodrama audiences. In
the matter of representationalism, any-
how, nothing is deemed too good for
them.
Leslie Howard is the diplomatist who
is sent from London to keep Russia’s
new revolutionary Government in the
war with the encouraging reminder that
Pitt, too, suffered from youth. After
passing through many perils, due in
almost every case to his own stupidities,
he is seen waiting with Kay Francis for
the bomb which will destroy them both.
Revolutionary soldiers, it seems, don’t
go upstairs and bayonet their defenceless
enemies; they shoot at windows and
toss bombs through the holes. In the
nick of time Lenin —wounded nigh unto
death by a would-be assassin’s bullet —
recovers, thus permitting Howard and
his Russian sweetheart to leave un-
scathed for England and matrimony.
A silly story? True. Yet it makes a
fine film. Its merit —apart from How-
ard’s study of a brave and dutiful though
weak and indecisive public-school Eng-
lishman —lies in its gallery of historical
portraits. Lenin lives in appearance,
voice and manner. So does Trotsky.
Kerensky—handsome, courtly, always
optimistic, always wrong wanders
through the brilliant crowd at the British
Embassy drably clad, the most conspicu-
ous figure there. Lloyd George isn’t
quite so good, but he and most of his
colleagues of the War Cabinet are recog-
nisable. Kay Francis is disappointing.
Her articulation sounds woollier than
usual, and her plain frocks rather dim
her beauty. William Gargan is the real
hero. He plays a gallant young Ameri-
can Red Grosser who tries to put anti-
Red pep into Howard, and gets shot.
“Six-Day Bike Rider”
A Joe Brown farce which deals with
bodylining as practised on American
bicycle tracks, Joe is an affable and
affectionate creature by nature, but he
becomes terrible when a scoundrelly pro-
fessional bikist tries to get off with
Maxine Doyle, his girl. In the race Joe
and his rival do things to each other
that no cricketer would stoop to, and the
track umpires take it as a matter of
course. To detail half the idiocies that
go on would take a column or more.
Enough to say that “Six-Day Bike Rider”
is as madly hilarious and as touching in
its way as Disney’s gorgeous “Grass-
hopper and the Ants” on the same bill.
“By Your Leave”
Frank Morgan, supposed to be 42, but
looking 62 and behaving 12, is a tired
businessman married to Genevieve
Tobin. The couple decide to have a
week’s holiday apart—Mr, Morgan’s
idea, for he thinks he can still play
Lothario. His performance is a flop,
but his wife meets a beautiful young
man (Neil Hamilton), and is about to
elope with him when her husband calls
the experiment off.
The dope sheets describe this as a
rollicking comedy, but it doesn’t assay
one rollick to the hour. Morgan being
bashful with a “professional entertainer”
is the least enlivening spectacle the screen
has seen for aeons. At Sydney Capitol.
“Marie Gallante”
Even less effective as an antidote to
a wintry summer is Ketti Gallian, Fox
Film’s new gift to mankind. As an
actress she’s a rather nice-looking girl,
but such interest as attaches to the plot
to blow up the Panama Canal outlined
in “Marie Gallante” is independent of
her vague and indeterminate influence.
Shanghaied from a French village by
a gun-runner, dumped in a South
American port, she sang and danced in
honky-tonks, and remained just a sweet,
pure, innocent, trusting little creature,
with but one desire —to get back to La
Belle France. American, Japanese and
English secret agents and a king of crime
endeavored to enmesh her in their plots
(why, the Lord alone knows), but for
all the use she was to them they might
have saved themselves the trouble.
Villainy is unmasked by the great
American patriot and sleuth Spencer
Tracy after a series of incidents periodi-
cally interrupted by third-rate cabaret
croonery. Also at Sydney Capitol.
Gus Bluett in “Nice Goings On”
“Lady by Choice”
At Sydney Plaza. May Robson’s in-
terpretation of a rowdy, gin-saturated
ex-actress, etc., who was lovable in spite
of her failings is diverting if incredible.
She is adopted as a mother by Carole
Lombard, fan dancer, as a publicity
stunt. Fan-dancing, judging by out-
breaks in current talkies, seems to have
succeeded the founding of new religions
as the greatest secondary industry among
females of the U.S.A. Its philosophy is
that something seen is not half so inter-
esting as something nearly seen. So its
exponent dances naked, but reveals less
than if evening-gowned. May is regen-
Charles Norman in “Nice Goings On.”
crated by her desire to save Carole from
going the same noisome way as she did.
She succeeds, though not before her blun-
dering nearly wrecks Carole’s romance
with their mutual friend lawyer Roger
Pryor. An interesting study is provided
by Walter Connolly, a Judge who tem-
pers justice with understanding.
“I Sell Anything”
Pat O’Brien is a loud-voiced, frog-
mouthed slum auctioneer. Claire Dodd
blinds him to the pure love of Ann
Dvorak, and induces him to take up
spieling among the rich on Broadway.
Ann protests unavailingly when he be-
comes involved in a sale of faked an-
tiques. Still, she will not desert him,
and, of course, is at hand with her great
love intact when Claire clears out with
the sale proceeds and a boy friend. In-
teresting as an expose of the methods of
unscrupulous auctioneers and furniture-
fakers.
“The Pointing Finger”
The story of this Civic film concerns
a curse laid on the Earls of Edensore by
an abbot whose priory was pillaged to
form their estate. Michael Hogan, as
a low-class Irish crook, and an unknown
in the part of a lower-class hanger-on
make it worth while. Hogan’s blarney
is entirely convincing. Another unknown
who depicts the seventh Earl —the film
deals chiefly with the eighth—does his
little conspicuously well.
“Let’s Talk It Over”
Seen in slightly different forms dozens
of times before. A bumptious, supremely
self-confident gob (Chester Morris)
rescues a society girl from drowning, and
attaches himself to her and her friends.
He’s the joke of the decade, but at the
finish the young lady sobs “I lurv you”
over his unconscious body. N.B.—He
became unconscious in a car smash
achieved when he was tight.
Some First Nights
In “Tristan and Isolde” the Fuller
Opera Co. presented to Sydney its most
impressive performance to date. The
orchestra, under De Abravenal’s baton,
was at its very good best; the principal
singers—Madame Austral, Madame
Br unskill, Walter Widdop, Horace
Stevens and Norman Allin —were at the
top of their form, and the audience
evinced great enthusiasm at the conclu-
sion of each act, “Bravos!” being inter-
spersed with the hand-clapping. Settings
and costumes were appropriate, acting

7s. Bd.) was £8 11s. Id. better than in
1933 ; in addition to swelling commis-
sions and other income (gross profit
mounted £131,428 to £485,948), the bad-
debts problem was relieved. Trading
exes. (£301,593) were actually £4332
lower, though the tax bill (£27,317) was
£5295 higher; after allowing for £68,000
debenture interest and adjustments, the
year’s net profit was £89,038, an improve-
ment of £130,465 on the loss of 1933.
Though current liabilities are more
than covered by cash alone, the decision
on the point of handouts to shareholders
was deferred long enough for the direc-
tors to observe the unhappy relapse in
wool prices. Only the div. on the 5 p.c.
pref. stock, for one year (to June, 1931)
was declared ; the £50,288 of profit
remaining brought the slender reserves up
to £477,413.
Financial crises are no new experience
to the co.; scars of the ’nineties can still
be traced. Whatever inner reserves exist
were of little avail during the three bad
years 1931-33, when disclosed losses
totalled £240,338. The “cheap” money
which helped the co. during the flush
times —the £3,200,000 of pref. and de-
benture capital costs an average of 4.7
p.c. —is no longer cheap. The experi-
ence of ord. stockholders is shown in (he
introductory table.

In 1905 there was only £135,395 of
shareholders’ capital left; the present
total of £2,500,000 has been reached by
cash issues. The debenture debt is
£1,700,000 at 4 p.c. Last term advances,
etc., were worked down a further £660,703
—woolgrowers were in an improved posi-
tion to meet their obligations. The cash
and public securities on hand at balance
day totalled £1,482,659, while the float-
ing debt figured at only £606,718.
The market, disappointed with the
present trend of wool prices, puts a value
of £45 on the ord. stock, as against £6l
a year ago. The 5 p.c. prefs. are at
£9O in Maoriland. The outlook for wool
at the moment suggests a steadier price,
though a lower one ; the precipitous col-
lapse which started in January, 1934,
appears to have been checked. But sales
are still sluggish, mainly on account of
Continental import restrictions.

The £485,390 of 7 p.c. pref. capital has
called for everything that this holding
co. has claimed as earnings over the past
four years. But exactly how its operating
cos. are progressing is not disclosed. Last
term interest, divs., etc. (£37,947), im-
proved £3007, while the parent’s hand-
ful of exes. (£4487, including income
tax) was cut back £1759. Net profit was
thus £4765 better, and, qfter handing the
prefs. their regular £33,977, £1241 was
carried to nominal reserves (£110,242) —
“nominal” because of the undisclosed
position of the pups.
At August 31 the co. had £901,043 in-
vested in a group of subsidiaries which
trade in wholesale groceries, butchers’
supplies, etc., throughout Australia and
Maoriland. Of this amount £583,420
was in shares, the rest being deposits.
This is as much as the parent’s balance
sheet discloses:

Since 1923 it has put up £287,947 of
share and deposit moneys to finance the
growth of the respective undertakings,
including the erection of a new ware-
house in Brisbane, extensions to the
Perth and Wellington (M.L.) premises
and purchase of a part of the old-estab-
lished drygoods business of James Ser-
vice and Co., Melbourne. Until inter-
rupted by slump the ords. received a
fair return, and the reserves in the busi-
ness have been built up since the public
came in in 1920.
The co.’s subsidiaries are meeting keen
competition everywhere ; there are retail
as well as wholesale sections. But, “due
to the cautious policy,” and “with in-
creases in profitable turnover for the
period.... there has been a general im-
provement in our business throughout
Australia and M.L.” Manufacture and
marketing of the co.’s proprietary brands
have reached the stage where any notable
increase will call for further capital ex-
penditure. The directors mention the
co.’s susceptibility to the trend of prices
of primary products.
The public is mainly interested in the
A shares, which rank with the B’s for
both div. and capital. At 245. 6d. the A’s
return 5.7 p.c. ; the visible cover is
365. 7d. in net tangibles, subject to any
goodwill, etc., that may exist in the
subsidiaries. As far as one can see
through the veil which covers up the
operating co.’s figures, the 5.7 p.c. return
is reasonably well secured, and the scrip
does not appear to be over-priced.

Chief concern at the moment is stocks
(£43,780), up £12,152 during the term.
Wool prices rose and fell again during
the year, making trading tricky. But
the board was satisfied with results, “all
known contingencies” having been pro-
vided for. The enlarged mill was again
kept busy, and turnover improved over
the previous year’s.
Competition is keen in knitted goods,
though the tweed and worsted markets
are not so overcrowded. The co. claims
to have found a ready market for its
products. From one -cause and another
profit on manufacturing, etc. (£12,685),
during the co.’s last term dropped £2277 ;
exes. (£8177) were £833 lighter, and the
p. and 1. balance dropped back £1444.
Though the 5 p.c. to shareholders (down
1 p.c.) left £917 for reserves, no extra
provision for depreciation was made as in
the previous year, when £2OOO more than
the ordinary wear-and-tear allowance
was carried to depreciation reserve.
The plant, considerably extended a
couple of years ago in order to cope with
the demand for worsteds, is shown at
“cost, less depreciation.” Then there is
the depreciation reserve of £6OOO. This
table shows the chief balance-sheet move-
ments over several years:—

Manufacture is carried on at Ipswich,
where a wide range of woollen textiles
is produced. During 1933 the book value
of plant moved up £4287 ; there has been
little increase since. The factory-build-
ings item remained unchanged at £19,886
last term. The more or less liquid sur-
plus (£37,402) improved £3241.
For the 15s. shares, backed by net tan-
gibles with a book value of 18s. 5d., the
market pays 15s. 9d. Return at that
figure is 4.7 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis.

It has been a sound investment for
Digger shareholders. The 7 p.c. distri-
bution has not been threatened for seven
years, and reserves, helped particularly
by a conservative policy during 1920-28,
have piled up in fine style. During the
depression they have never been raided
in order to meet the div., and are now
equal to 58 p.c. of the capital.
Brigadier - General Robert Smith
founded the co. in 1920. Many returned
men of both services applied part of
their gratuity money in taking shares ;
they buy materials from the co. at cost,
and other Diggers get a special cut. A
loan of £50,000 was granted by the Com-
monwealth, and later increased to
£60,000 ; the last of it was repaid in 1933.
The emergency tariff and the exchange
were a great help to textile manufac-
turers. Duties have lately been reduced
on some lines, and Australian mills are
feeling overseas competition once more,
principally in worsteds and tweeds. Still,
notwithstanding the ups and downs in
the wool market, entailing a “serious
writing-down of values during August,”
the Geelong R. S. and S. closed its year
to Aug. 31 with a gross profit £2845
higher at £32,958, and net £751 better
at £11,105. After the usual handout
£4359 was carried to reserves (£56,336,
deducting £2OOO transferred to the staff
fund).
Finance has never been much of a
worry during the period covered by the
“Wild Cat’s” records. The 14-acre free-
hold at Geelong cost only £lB5O, and
though the plant was bought about 1921,
when prices were still fairly high, ample
depreciation appears to have been
allowed for since. The factory has been
kept up to date, and new types of manu-
facture have been added from time to
time. Though freeholds, etc., showed a
net increase of £5955 last year, book
value of plant, etc., dropped £1075:

Some indication of the co.’s financial
policy can be gained from the fact that
in 1933 £16,296 was admittedly spent on
fixed assets, but their book value moved
up only £9483. Stocks at last balance
were £2336 higher at £62,123, but the
management appears satisfied with the
item. Despite the capital outlay during
the year the more or less liquid surplus
was only £793 lighter at £45,172.
Net tangible backing for each £1 of
capital amounts to £1 11s. 7d. The scrip
is not listed.

It is taking time for the business to
recover lost earning power. During the
worst of the depression the co. suffered
severely, losses (£8267 and £4OBB re-
spectively) showing up instead of profits
in 1931 and 1932. In 1933 trading
showed a net surplus of £184; £6301
profit on a property sale encouraged the
board to hand out 2\ p.c. to share-
holders. During the term to Sept. 30
last those in control put the year’s net
earnings at £3054, up £2870 ; the 2y p.c.
div. was repeated, and called for £1759
more than that.
Building activity is the key to the
prosperity or otherwise of brick and pot-
tery cos. like Hoffman. These figures
show the trend of the trade over the last
six years:

They represent the value of building
permits issued in Greater Melbourne.
Last year was the best since slump com-
menced ; an extra £1,206,000 was laid
out in bricks, concrete, mortar, etc., in
the centenary city during the twelve-
month to November 30. But as a
good deal of it was in respect of city
buildings Hoffman Brick’s profits did
not respond as much as optimists might
have looked for.
The co.’s comfortable finances are
appreciated by the share market:

The debt (£4094) is light, and a co. that
could sell a property in 1933 at a profit
of £6301 on book values is not likely to
have neglected depreciation allowances
on other fixed assets. Freeholds stand
at £75,477 (down £109), plant, stores,
etc., at £71,472 (down £8224), while stock
values (£18,466) are £942 lower. Shares
in other cos. remain unchanged at
£41,821.
Book debts (£14,234), Commonwealth
securities (£27,758), cash, etc. (£4946),
exceeded the debt by £42,844 at balance
day, an improvement of £2849.
Net tangible backing is 255. 3d. in net
tangibles, 6s. sd. of it in surplus floating
assets, the rest largely plant, worth what
it can earn. The market prices the scrip
at 18s. 9d., at which figure the return is
2.6 p.c. on last year’s div. basis.

Apart from small bacon-curers there
is a good deal of capital invested in this
class of business, which is based on the
breakfast bacon-and-eggs. United Pro-
visions, the big Hutton-Foggitt Jones
merger, has a share register of £1,400,000.
George Farmer, with a capital of
£150,000 (£112,000 represents the pur-
chase price of George Farmer’s old busi-
ness, taken over in 1919), has paid divs.
right through, though latterly they have
been a shadow of their former self.
From 1926 to 1933 there was a per-
sistent fall in profit-earning. Before that
it was a great money-spinner. In 1932
gross earnings slipped £5301, followed by
a further slide of £5385 in 1933. Last
term there was a recovery of £3280 (to
£29,160); exes. (£16,783) were cut back
£BB6, and so the net profit (£12,377) im-
proved £4166. The slip in the trading
position having been arrested, after hand-
ing the prefs. their 8 p.c. the ords. were
treated to an extra 1 p.c., and £1277 was
carried to visible reserves (£17,173). They
are not a very stout prop for capital, but
there is substantial inner strength.
Finances, too, are very comfortable;

TROUBLES
Financial Independence and
Security for your dependents
You can make sure that your wife's
future Is secure.
?m
You can arrange adequate protection
for your children.
m
m
You can enjoy life with the know-
ledge that all is well.
YOU may have anxiety about
money matters. Get rid of it!
Anxiety is a frequent cause of
illness. Be free of it! The man
who joins the A.M.P. and lets the
Society shoulder the burden of his
anxiety will have the heart and
time to win the happiness to which
he is entitled.
The best time for a man to lay
the foundation of his future finan-
cial security is when he is young,
but any time is a good time.
The experience of A.M.P. counsel-
lors is that few men and women
have any idea of the way the
Society can help them; they do
not realise that there are A.M.P.
policies to educate children, to pro-
vide dowries for daughters, to
build homes, to start sons in busi-
ness, to provide trips round the
world, to do all manner of desir-
able things!
Do you realise what A.M.P. mem-
bership can do for you? If you
don’t, ask the nearest A.M.P. office
to send an experienced counsellor
to talk the matter over with you.
Tell the counsellor your needs, and
let him give you his advice. Ask
him to show you how much you
will need to invest to obtain the
benefits you require. Above all,
don’t delay! One never knows what
is going to happen.
If you live far from an A.M.P. office, ask that a copy of “Investing in
Happiness” be posted to you—you’ll never regret reading it.

During December Wiluna (W.A.)
treated 35,237 tons of stone for bullion
estimated to contain 81770 z. fine, valued
at £57,852 (stg.) or £71,881 (Aust.). The
tonnage treated was affected by stop-
pages. Working costs were £37,041
(Aust.), or 21s. a ton, including 2s. 6d.
for development redemption. The
working surplus (subject to over-
head) for the month is put at
£34,840 (Aust.). On construction and
equipment £4365 was spent during the
month. Developmental work continues
to expose good values. On the east lode,
1000 ft. level, the winze 1251 ft. south has
been sunk 43ft. in ore averaging 255.
(gold at 855.) over a 4ft. width. In the
1200 ft. level a drive has ben advanced
12ft. in 18s. ore, and a crosscut has
exposed 245. ore over a width of Bft.
In the west lode further 21s. to 30s.
values have been uncovered, while on the
Bulletin lease a new shaft has exposed
255. values over 12ft. and ore going
20s. 6d. over 50ft. Work stopped on
January 7 owing to the strike —still on.
“Auditor”: Some well-informed quar-
ters in London regard Wiluna as having
the largest potential tonnage of low-
grade gold ore of any mine in the world.
In addition, working profits per ton are
satisfactorily high,
Wiluna Gold Corp. takes exception to
a report recently spread in London that
it had opened negotiations with a con-
cern known as Western Consolidated
Gold Reefs to form a new mining and
finance co. with a capital of £1,000,000,
or some figure near it. In denying the
report the secretary of Wiluna states that
that co. hasn’t at any time negotiated
with the co. mentioned.

Commonwealth Mining and Finance’s
Yellowdine options continue to promise
remarkable things. Ore development to
January 12 was put at 30,000 tons, con-
taining 60,000 fine ounces. Check samp-
ling of the mine workings averaged
54dwt. A crosscut between shafts No. 2
and 3 showed an ore-body 57ft. wide,
assaying 52dwt. Of the ore developed.
90 p.c. is said to present “absolutely no
metallurgical problems.”

As the result of its win in the British
Courts, Golden Horseshoe has been
credited with £22,500 income tax refund,
which brings total profits for last year
up to £67,800, compared with £50,200
for the previous 12 months. Net profits
at £46,800 exceed by £21,500 the figure
for the previous year, and with the sum
brought forward enable a div. of Is. a
share to be paid. The tonnage of resi-
dues re-treated was slightly smaller, and
the grade was down. This was offset to
some extent by reduced costs and by
returns from smelted charcoal and ash
high in gold content, while additional
revenue from gold premium and ex-
change raised the yield Is. a ton. Only
about a year’s supply of residues worth
retreatment is now left. Cost of re-
treatment plant has been practically
written off, and some shareholders are
wondering how the co. will dispose of
its large liquid resources when the final
clean-up takes place.

Gold Exploration, Ltd., put out a
further 20,433 shares in London last
month at a premium of 3s. 6d. a share.
The issue was made for cash, and in

Sydney’s latest activities on the West-
ralian goldfields include the flotation of
the Resolute mine, near Ora Banda, and

Kookynie—in all, about 2,500,000 tons.

Happy Warrior Gold Mines, N.L., is
on the stocks in Adelaide. Nominal capi-
tal is £75,000 in 2s. shares, of which the
public is offered 400,000. Vendors take
30.000 f.-ps. and £ll,OOO in cash, and
have the right to take up 70,000 shares
at par within nine months of the co.’s
formation. The property, 52 acres, is
miles from Menzies (W.A.), and is close
to the southern boundary of the Lady
Shenton. Mines Dept, records show
10,992 tons crushed for an average of
15.3dwt., including sands. The assays
given in the abridged prospectus are
promising ; one wonders why the vendor
syndicate takes so much of its considera-
tion out in cash. The ground-floor rights
reserved over the 70,000 shares for nine
months is another noticeable feature.
* * * *
Pomme d’Or (W.A.) has deepened its
shaft to 178 ft. ; at 200 ft. it is to be opened
out. The water supply has increased to
approximately 1000 gallons daily. If this
is adequate to run the mill three shifts,
the manager anticipates a 30-ton crushing
each day without additional labor. On
January 9 crushing commenced on 115
tons, including 55 tons of rejected 4dwt.
ore ; the mill recovery was 360 z., while
the sands assay 6dwt. The 60 tons of
new ore was taken from the opencut
near the surface.

Lake Austin Eureka G.M. Co. (N.L.),
formed late in 1934 to take over part
of the Island Queen mine and the Eureka
mine at Austin, on the Murchison (W.A.)
goldfield, reports that in the n.-e. lode
30 tons of ore has been broken, values
going lOdwt. In the Island Queen similar
values have been found; on the Iron-
clad lode 49 tons assaying 7dwt. has
been broken. Boreholes in the opencut
have “proved 500 tons of payable ore.”
Work is reported to be proceeding
steadily with the erection of the plant.
The public was offered 150,000 2s. shares
in the float, while the vendors took
100.000 f.-ps. and £3500 in cash.' The
Ironclad lease is apparently a recent
acquisition.

S’African goldmining cos. are hope-
ful, in view of the much-improved state
of the country’s finances, that the Union
Government, wheh introducing its next
Budget, will lessen the burden of taxa-
tion on the industry. Last year Govern-
ment took 64 p.c. of the increased profits,
leaving 36 p.c. for the cos. To-day
direct revenue from goldmines comprises
over 40 p.c. of Budget revenue, as against
about 15 p.c. prior to 1933.

Sulphide Gold (Junction Reefs), at
Mandurama (N.S.W.), reports that, for
the six weeks to December 29, 855.3 tons
of ore was crushed for a working profit
of £341 (exclusive of development and
capital expenditure). Christmas holidays
affected tonnage and profit.

Gympie Chamber of Commerce and
Mines is energetically pushing forward
the field’s claims for a share of Federal
money voted for a mining revival. It
regards the northern and southern areas
as offering opportunities for the early
production of payable gold.

New Queen Cross mine, Charters
Towers (Q.), which has been handed over
to a Sydney-formed co., will be actively
producing in the near future. Mining
operations in a small way were com-
menced on December 29, when work
was started on No. 4 level, from which
it is hoped to produce a profitable crush-
ing in a short time. In this level there is
a big low-grade lode, from 3yft. to sft.
in thickness. A sample crushing is also
being obtained from the mullock dump
at the site of the mine. The shoot of ore
at No. 7 level is one the co. intends to
develop, and work will proceed on it as
soon as the full equipment of machinery
is installed. Negotiations are in progress
for the erection of an up-to-date battery.
* * * *
After boring five holes on its conces-
sion area of 500 acres at Charters
Towers (Q.), Towers Drilling, Ltd., which
had been exploring the area, has ceased
operations. Not one of the holes sunk
produced anything likely to prove pay-
able.
* * * *
So far Australian goldmines haven’t
noticeably adopted the policy of lower-
ing the grade of ore treated so as to pro-
long the payable life of the mine. Taking
the long view, it is probably the soundest
economics to do as S’Africa is doing,
but the future is always unknown. Also,
holders of scrip bought at big premiums
are likely to kick.

“Towyn”: During 1934 over a dozen
Welsh goldmines, most of which had
closed down prior to the war, reopened
under the simulus of rising gold prices. It
is nearly 50 years ago since an Australian
named Morgan, who had entered the
Commons for a Welsh constituency,
floated a goldmining co. in North
Wales, the first of several modern under-
takings. Gold has been mined in Wales
after a fashion from time immemorial,
but up-to-date methods were introduced,
and several of the ventures were success-
ful. Just before the war one mine turned
out £BOOO worth of gold in a week, and
the output for one year was valued at
£60,000. The very latest equipment is
being installed at some of the reopened
mines, and costs are simplified by abun-
dant water power on or near the pro-
perties.
QUESTION ANSWERED.

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY
The Company is being formed with the objects stated in its draft Memorandum of Associa-
tion, but principally for the purpose of acquiring from the Vendor, which is the Warnoi
Syndicate, Gold Mining Leases Nos. 5484 z, 5578 z, and 24 acres pegged out and applied for,
containing in all a total of 52 acres, approximately U miles from the town site ot Menzies,
80 miles north of Kalgoorlie, and within half a mile of the southern boundary ot the
\hey are therefore in the centre of the auriferous belt, which is well defined, and extends
from the Lady Sherry on the north to the Menzies Consolidated on the south, and which is
more particularly described in Geological Survey Bulletin No. 22. , ,
The leases to be acquired by the Company have been favorably reported on by two
independent mining engineers. E. J. Gourlay, Esq., Mining Engineer, late Inspector ot Mines
for W.A., states inter alia in his report dated 26th November, 1934;
“Situation. —About 1 j miles from Menzies townsite, and on the line of gold-bearing reel
which extends from the Lady Sherry mine on the north, through the Crusoe Fust Flit Menzies
Gold Reefs, known as the Friday Balkis, the Florence Lady Shenton Alpha Mines to the Lady
Harriet on the south, the Warrior area being between the Lady Harriet and the Lady Shenton
Alpha Mines, all of which have produced highly payable values, and are still producing.
“I have inspected these mines on many occasions while I was Government Mines Inspector.
The gold-bearing line of country over this length of approximately 5 miles by j mile in
width, and the nature of this country is quartz with horneblende schist material or lode
matter, the surrounding rock being greenstone The Lady Shenton is now opening up below
the 400 ft. level from the Alpha Shaft, so that there cannot be any doubt of the continuity
in depth of the Menzies Reefs or the Warrior Mine.
“In the middle lode, which is worked down from a X course, there is an average width ot
3ft. of ore, and still going down at 204 ft. Lode No. 3 on the east has been worked down to
a depth of 80ft., and is still going down, and has been sampled in good sections. The average
width is 3ft. 6in., with a little galena and pyrites showing This appears to be a good
mining virginius H R Murray, M.1.M.M., dated 27th November, 1934, states
interjdia 2soft. level the lode has been driven on for a distance of 44ft.; it is 4ft. wide, and
is. dipping west about 60 degrees. It shows to be going underfoot well defined. Above this
level sloping has been carried on.
“From the 200 ft. level the ore has been sloped out for a distance of 200 ft. on .a southerly
pitch and westerly dip; there is a width of 3ft. 6in. Samples were taken at the south face
over 2ft. wide, and assayed 22dwt. 18gr. and 7dwt.”

ABORIGINALITIES
“M.R.P.”: 1 took a job as “gov-
erness” at a South Aus. homestead.
Besides trying to put sdme wit into a
well-nigh uncontrollable child I was ex-
pected to milk, cook, wash, sew, clean,
mend, garden, wait on table, make butter,
scrub burnt pots, go for the cows, stack
bushes, entertain visitors, play cards
with the kids, knit them pullovers, be
victim for bodyline bowling and clean up
the mess after a pig-killing. Reading,
walking, riding, listening-in, making
friends and even going to town were all
frowned upon. Wages, 10s. a week. 1
endured it three months without an erup-
tion, but now the rest of my life’s my
own.
“Ophir”: While Aboliars are dealing
with snakes—black snakes particularly—
will they tell me what sort of joker it
is that we meet on the reefs and beaches
in N.Q.? He is a real red-bellied black
snake, up to 5ft. long, and he looks like
sudden death in scales. He has been
seen to grab a dog, hang on and shake ;
and the result didn’t even take the curl
out of Pongo’s tail. He frequents the
reefs when the tide is out. I have seen
him —or his elder brother —a mile or
more inland in among rocks in rough
places, and also I’ve put paid to the
account of one that was swimming four
miles from land.
* * * *
“S. Roo Rum”: Anson Bay, Norfolk
Is., is the favorite spawning place for
the sharks of that region. They arrive in
October. White coral sand lies in patches
between immense boulders for a long
way out to sea. Standing on the cliffs,
200ft. or 300ft. above, one can count
scores of sharks, some of great size, clearly
silhouetted against the sand. When the
young terrors are born the mother shark
swims incessantly around them in a large
circle at great speed, preventing their
straying and protecting them from
marauders. Evidently she has no mis-
conceptions as to the character of her
neighbors. This unique shark hatchery
is a great attraction to visitors.
* * * *
“Ekib”: The goanna and the kooka-
burra aren’t bosom pals. Recently, near
Bingara, saw a kooka and a go. locked
in a terrific grip. The bird had been
bitten round the neck and the reptile was
gashed in several places. Apparently the
kooka’s plan of lifting his opponent and
then dropping him from a height had
failed, with advantage to the goanna;
but the bird put up such a good fight
that the combat ended in a draw—both
dead.
* * * *
“Rich Uncle”: At the recent Scouts’
jamboree in Melbourne the Fijian con-
tingent greatly honored Vic. Governor
Huntingfield by presenting him with a
tabua, the sacred tooth of the sperm
whale, which is the Fijian equivalent of
the Order of the Garter. Like that deco-
ration, there was “no damnea merit
about it,” its use being restricted to those
who, by right of birth, were paramount
chiefs in Fiji. When stark old Cakabau
pleaded with Queen Victoria to take Fiji
under her protection to save him from
the Yankees, he gave her a whole neck-
lace of tabua, such has never been seen
since. It should be among the Crown
jewels in the Tower, cheek by jowl with
the Koh-i-noor and the Black Prince’s
ruby.
* * * *
“Bufo”: Night lines set from the shore
for cod and other big fish in S.Q. waters
are useless when water-rats are about.
They will dive and take the baited book
deep into their burrows under the bank.
Often enough they tangle it around vari-
ous obstructions, so that the fisherman
loses hook, trace and yards of line. Also,
the rats will kill chickens and steal eggs
—and kill grown fowls, too, on occa-
sion. Invading riverside houses or
camps is a mere interlude —they will
stand up to you if necessary. The skin
of a water-rat in good winter condition
makes the handsomest of tobacco
pouches. But I hate to see those gallant
pirates go out for mere trade purposes.

“M.G.”: Saw the abos. at Lake Tyers
(Vic.) —cultured gentlemen all of them,
and about four generations from savag-
ery—making fire by twirling a stick for
the entertainment of tourists. They got a
spark right enough, and, with shredded
bark, turned it into a genuine blaze.
Then the expert contemptuously per-
mitted the fire kindled in the ancestral
manner to die out and, producing an up-
to-date petrol lighter from his pocket,
started up a cigarette. The spoken Eng-
“As an engine-driver, gents., Bill’d like to stick to the timetable; but as a
nartist ’e can’t miss that sunset.”
lish of these dusky autocthons suggests
that they have good jobs awaiting them
in broadcast stations. Their speaking
voices are the softest, yet the most pene-
trating, known to science. One of these
days an abo. will be taken to England
to teach the rude, uncultured islanders
how to deliver their own words.

“F.A.4”: We had mustered the pad-
dock and met for lunch. It was a fairly
big paddock: 7000 gummy ewes and
their offspring were being held on the
water. “Where’s Bertie?” someone
asked. No one had seen that jackeroo
since the split-up. Sundown and no sign
of him. Something must have happened;
and, after all, Bertie was human. I
scarcely slept that night. At daylight I
left the second overseer to mark the
lambs, got my horse and rode out. For
the first hour or so his tracks weren’t
hard to find or follow ; but after that
they swung, crossed and recrossed, head-
ing nowhere. I couldn’t figure it out.
The horse wasn’t running loose ; there
were no tracks of a mob of sheep ahead
of him ; it seemed just aimless wander-
ing—characteristic of Bertie. But about
10 o’clock I found his horse, with blood
on the saddle. Tragedy! An hour later
I found him, lying full length, motion-
less, blood on his face. Alongside
him lay the oldest ewe in Queensland,
her legs tied with his handkerchief. Was
he dead? Not a bit of it. For a few
minutes my language was in the cham-
pionship class. Looking pale and in-
jured Bertie defended himself: “Well,
Mr. Woolblind, before we commenced
you distinctly said you wanted a clean
muster.” The blood? A scratch from
a gidya twig while he was following the
old ewe in the dark.
* * * *
“Dungeness”: Toadfish (B. 2/1 /'35)
are fatal to cats, producing a rapid
paralysis of the legs which soon extends
to the respiratory muscles. As for larger
animals, years ago two Malay divers in
Thursday Island ate, for a bet, the cooked
flesh of a large toadfish. Nothing hap-
pening, they took another and larger bet
that they would eat the cooked liver.
Both were very unpleasantly dead before
next morning.
❖ ❖ *
“Smeller”: They used to breed good
goats in that mulga country near the
Milo (Q.) shed (B. 5/12/’34). 1 think,
though, the best goat-teams used to be
found in the desert country about Jericho.
There was a fellow there who had a stand-
ing wager for years. No one ever took
him up —no one was game. He had 15
wethers, with which he offered to pull
any five draught horses. The rope had to
pass through a pulley-block on the ground
so the neddies couldn’t lift the goats off
their feet; and the rigging and the goats
were there from 1902 onwards for any-
one who cared to chance it. Each of
those goats would get down to it at his
boss’s word. They’d hang and choke be-
fore they’d let up. No jerk and fly-back
about that lot; they took hold; they
hung ; they were there till the cows came
home and the party of the other part
came with them. At a straight-out trial
of strength the horses might have lifted
a greater poundage. But the horses hadn’t
got the stick-and-hang of the goats, the
“dogged-as-does-it” and the ability to
get down and stay down.
* * * *
“Larrapinta”: The old German cocky
invited me into dinner ; during the meal
his daughters Freda and Rosa chat-
tered in German, obviously about me,
with abundant giggles. Then a blowfly
came cruising around the table. I pointed
to the meat-dish and said “Kook auf—
Brummer kompt!” Knives and forks
clattered down, the whole family stared,
and the girls blushed. Dad roared
with- laughter; mother delivered a lec-
ture on the folly of imagining that other
people couldn’t understand German.
1 explained with a grin that those four
words were the only German I knew.
The girls wouldn’t believe me, and were
very quiet during the rest of my visit.
* * * *
“Simpering Jane”: “Gibbering” is no
adjective to apply to a lady (B. 12/12/’34):
It’s a long way from the headwaters of
the Barcoo, above Blackall, to where it
joins the Thompson at the Crossing, this
side of Windorah. South of Blackall, a
kookaburra would be a rare thing, and
one in three years would be above the
average. And the Moonie isn’t s.-w.
Queensland. It may have been outback
in “G.G.b’s” young days ; now it is little
more than an outer suburb of Brisbane
and a link with Sydney.
* * * *
“8.G.P.”: On the old station heme in
s.-w. Queensland three of my old mounts
are still alive at 32, 33 and 36 years re-
spectively. The junior member can still
carry his rider over a 3ft. log and is at
present one of the night horses —more
out of respect for his feelings, I gather,
than with the idea of working him. Don’t
know whether it’s the Mitchell and blue
grass they live on, but they seem very
creditable ages for three horses on one
station to attain.
* * * *
“Crowquill”: Isn’t it time some of
these writing coves who have been so
busy slinging off in The Bulletin at the
bloomers made by their black-and-white
cobbers when drawing swords, saddles,
axes and other oddments took some
notice of their own slips through care-
lessness or ignorance?
Listening-in to the broad-
cast of a play which was
announced as a winner of
a centenary prize in Mel-
bourne, I heard an indi-
vidual who had been
picked up unconscious on
the road explain his pre-
dicament. Said he: “I’m
afraid I’m a poor rider;
my horse reared, so I
went over his head.” In
the days of his youth the
writer was the admiration
of a somewhat horsy
family by reason of the
many new and unusual
ways he devised of falling
off or being impelled from
a horse. He can lay his
hand on his heart and say,
as quite a fair horseman in
the main, he could never
have accomplished the
feat just described. In-
deed, he is game to bet
that even those old-time
circus acrobats who used
to throw double somer-
saults over a dozen horses
ranged side by side
couldn’t have done it.
* * *
“Drayton”: Gordon
Bennett’s famous dictum
that, while a bulldog bit-
ing a man wasn’t news, a
man biting a bulldog
would be, is recalled by a
Toowoomba (Q.) happen-
ing. One Edwards went
"into a paddock with a
rifle to shoot a bullock.
He wounded the animal,
which promptly charged.
Edwards thought better of
a second shot and, throw-
ing away the rifle, made
for a near-by fence. As
he crossed it a rifle shot
rang out, and Edwards
went out to it with a bullet in the jaw. In
his charge the bullock had kicked the
rifle, making it explode, and chance did
the rest.

“R.McD.”: While we were fishing off
Moruya Heads (N.S.W.) a big Norwegian
motor-ship swung off its course and
headed for our launch. It stopped about
half a mile away and started playing
tunes on its siren, so we decided to in-
vestigate. The captain hailed us from
the bridge. “I haf mit me one stowaway,
und I go direct to China. Please will you
put him ashore?” A few words with the
stowie demonstrated him to be an Aus-
tralian, so we decided to oblige. “T’ank
you,” said the skipper. “Und for your
trouble here is t’ree kervids. For some
flatfish,” he added, eyeing our catch, “1
will gif also a bottle of gin.” The deal
completed, we shoved off, everybody, in-
cluding the stowaway, well pleased.

“Airline”; I support “El V.” (B.
19/ 12/ 5 34). In parts of Central Aus-
tralia the natives do possess remarkably
small and, in many cases, well-shaped
feet. In Eastern Australia the toe that
has figured in so many Bulletin sketches
is generally apparent. Only in one point
are the tracks of blackfellows always
similar —they are all flat-footed.
RAIN-WORSHIPPERS.
At times I’ve listened to a lot
About the songs of birds at eve.
That some are sweet and some are not
Describes them all; but I believe,
Of all the many songs that rise
O’er scrubby ridge and open plain,
The best is that which prophesies
The coming of a fall of rain.
A deep-toned croak is followed by
A silence eloquent of doubt;
Another brings a shrill reply
From some small listener round about.
“Oh yes! Oh yes!” a third voice says;
A fourth avers “Quite right! Quite right!”
And then the tuneless hymn of praise
Disturbs the stillness of the night.
A bank of cloud blots out each star ;
From hymn of praise to song of mirth
The chorus changes; from afar
Steals down the scent of humid earth.
The air is full of restless things
That circle round in aimless flight,
Dart here and there on beating wings,
Then flash in silence out of sight.
A gust of wind—the frogs grow dumb
Before a thousand racing hoofs
That, speeding through the night, become
The crash of rain on iron roofs;
And then o’er half-choked gutters’ moans
And gurgles of some thirsty drain
Again arise those welcome tones
With which the frogs salute the rain.
QUEENSLAND.
MOROBE.


“Erua”: When the local Glee Club
gave its annual concert Mrs. Mc-
Tavish, the minister’s wife, handed a
spare ticket to Henare. He called on
us next day. “What kind of a show was
it, Henare?” we asked. “Orright,” said
Henare. “Sing very kood orright. Too
scared sing no kood.” In answer to our
surprised comment, Henare explained.
“Werra,” said he, “t’ey have te proke
stand up wit pigstick. He get t’em
scared orright. Very cross proke in pad
temper all te time. Just going to t’row
stick when t’ey all sing loud. Kood con-
cert orright.” We had no difficulty in
recognising Henare’s vignette of our
enthusiastic village musician.
“R.H.T.”: The Maori is beginning to
realise the blessings of life assurance.
A back-country storekeeper who acted
as local agent for a mutual society
was rung up in the middle of the night.
An agitated voice at the other end said:
“You come quick and insure my missus
—I t’ink she going to pass out.”
“Inaha”: The practical logic of the
Maori! Visiting a wayback town I
noticed that half a dozen porkers belong-
ing to one old fellow were minus ears
and tails. I managed to ask him why he
had chopped these appendages off. “Feed
pigs,” he beamed. “No good feeding
ears and tails.”

“M. Turlutu”; Why is Leichhardt held
up to reverence as a skilled and self-
sacrificing explorer (B, 9/1 /’35)? His
sole claim to credit rests on his first ex-
pedition to Port Essington, when he had
“Mind you, Pixie, it may be only a
rumor; but they say he’s Lady Fitz-
giggle’s lapdog!”
extraordinary luck. His second, in 1846,
showed that he had drawn entirely
wrong conclusions as to outfit and organi-
sation ; his third and last proved it disas-
trously. His idea was to cross to the
Westralian coast with eight white men
and two abos. in two years, taking as
food and transport 270 goats, 108 sheep,
13 mules and 15 horses. In buying his
goats he forgot to include a “billy,”
although depending on natural increase
on the journey. He took one frying-pan
and no medicine (a doctor, too!), except
one small bottle of quinine. Three
months after starting they were all down
with fever and dysentery. Some mustai d
and cress was sown by Bunce, the botan-
ist of the expedition —Dr. Leichhardt stole
and ate it. Throughout he showed him-
self a dud as bushman or explorer. Yet
his popular reputation to-day over-
shadows that of Mitchell, Hume, Howitt,
Giles or Forrest, any one of them worth
a dozen Leichhardts, whether as a man
or an explorer.

“The O.D.”: Somebody has lengthened
“Tripod’s” leg if he believes that when
dried roly-poly comes to a halt in a suit-
able spot it lets down its roots be-
comes a growing plant again (B. 2/1/’35).
The perambulating bush has a very small
root system in comparison with its size,
and even the green plants will break off
in a strong wind or if struck with a
shovel. When it dries and rolls away
across the plain it sheds its seeds, and is
as dead as ever it will be.

“O. W. Waireki”: Shearing at Sher-
brooke station, Poverty Bay (M.L.), on
Dec. 18, Sonny White, a quarter-caste
Maori, accomplished a new world’s shear-
ing record when he barbered 433 Romney
breeding ewes in nine hours. White, who
is also a champion axeman, did 91 of
the baa-baas before breakfast.

“G.F.D.’*: About three
years ago one of our bul-
locks caught his leg in some
loose wire. It left a scar
round his shin; after six
months or so he “picked up,”
but had a bumble leg about
twice natural size. Last
winter we killed him for
beef. Around the shin-bone
I found a double of 121-
gauge galvanised wire, and
for more than half-way solid
bone had grown completely over it, giv-
ing the appearance of the bone having
been drilled and the wire threaded
through.

“P.L.S.”: Any Aboliar know how far
a snake can fall without killing itself?
Have found and killed a number at the
bottom of shafts on the Lightning Ridge
(N.S.W.) opalfields. Some of the wrigglers
dropped over 70 feet, but I’ve yet to find
one killed in this way.
* * * *
“Seem’ ’Em”: Not all the visions about
in the bush are due to alcoholic excess.
At' Swan Creek (N.S.W.) a party was
building a bridge. Close to the line of
the bridge was a sturdy English oak
growing in midstream and protruding
10 feet or so
above the mass
of water-
hyacinth which
blocked the
creek. As some
of the toilers
were admiring
it, the tree sud-
d e n 1 y sank
from sight be-
foie their eyes,
like the Fata
Morgana. Later
it was explained
to the dumb-
founded men
that it was not
unusual for
acorns from the
trees bordering
the stream to
take root in the
dense mass of
hyacinth. These developed into trees
which sometimes grew for years, until
their weight proved too great for their
floating support and they sank through it.

“D.G.H.” (Wick, Scotland): An ox-
drawn cart is the delivery-van of a rural
general merchant in the far north of
this country. No animal is more docile
and patient; for 16 years he has daily
drawn his load over roads of all
kinds. His harness is simple, his diet
what he can find when customers are
being served. To us he is as much a part
of our world as the postman who delivers
letters or the aeroplane that carries
our mails and daily newspapers.
* * *
Not so many months ago
farmers were requesting the Defence De-
partment to lend them a few machine-guns
to wipe out the emus which were coming
down from the north in droves. Now
the same farmers would welcome the
approach of a few thousand of the big
dickybirds'to deal with the grasshoppers.
When the ’hoppers first appeared the im-
portation of shags was suggested ; but the
shags mostly frequent the coasts, and
their capture is a work of difficulty.
But a shag would be a mere dilettante
to an emu in ’hopper annihilation. A
bushman from the wide, open spaces of
Centralia assured me that he had seen
emus clean up acres of ’hoppers, some
of them gorging themselves to such an
extent that they became sick and had to
start all over again. An adequate supply
of emus and an adequate supply of
emetics would appear to be the best solu-
tion of the grasshopper problem. Mean-
while, the Argentine method of paying
the unemployed so much a bag for
’hoppers might be tried.
Shipwrecked Postman: "What’s that? A letter for a Mr. Russell? Mark it
‘Address unknown’ and chuck it back.”
“F.Y.7”: As one who knew the abo.
well in the days before rum, v.d. and
opium had taken possession of him, I
can endorse “Murlonga’s” statement that
no such thing as an abo. “king” or
“chief” existed, the tribe being bossed
by the elders, with occasionally a younger
man of great force of character taking
the lead. The same is true of most of
the Papuan tribes, with the exception
of those in the Trobriands, which boast
a hereditary chieftainship, the descent
being through the female line as with the
Basques and many other peoples scat-
tered all over the world. Both in Aus-
tralia and Papua I have known cases of
an exceptional woman bossing the show,
One was made a village constable in the
Northern Division of Papua, and did
good work for years. I was at Tamata
station once when the lady wheeled up
her own husband before the R.M. for
some malfeasance, and she had the
ratchets on him well and truly, too,
* * * *
“Eureka”: There are more bush “cures”
for rheumatism lhan any other complaint
to which the human body is hen. A
Riverma (N.S.W.) bushman sweais a
he cured himself by keeping r
potato in his pocket. Another carries a
piece of bluestone foi a similai propose
while a third pins his faith to a piece of
timber from a tree that had been struck
by lightning. Other alleged cures weie
made from pnckly-pear, brook-lime and
stinging nettles. Another familiar though
rather painful treatment is the bee-sting
method. Then there is the whale remedy.
A sufferer is completely immersed in the
decomposing body of a whale. Such
treatments were popular at 1 wofold
Bay before whaling there closed down.
* * * *
“S.G.”: Keeping the water up to a
few hundred head of stock on a remote
S.A. cattle run, I was visited daily by
thousands of birds of all descriptions.
Needless to say, it was a paradise for
birds of prey, especially hawks, and
it afforded wonderful opportunities of
studying these speedy killers. Flying low,
and taking advantage of every vestige of
cover, the sparrowhawk proved to be
the deadliest. The methods of a large
grey (mottled) hawk, obviously out of
his element but determined to get his
share of the feathered horde, were also
noted with interest. About the size of a
kitehawk—some Aboliar may be able to
identify him—for several days this awk-
ward big fellow blundered around after
the smaller fry with slight success. Then
he hit upon a plan, which was to wait
until the troughing was thronged with
birds. Swooping down, he would beat
his hapless victims into the water, fishing
them out and devouring them at his
leisure. His untidy Ways proved his un-
doing. Where the sparrowhawks always
took their kills to their favorite trees, he
dined at the trough, and made such a
litter of heads, feathers and other odds
and ends that I was finally forced to
draw a bead on him.
* * *
“W.P.T.”: Lightning seems to play in
certain spots for no apparent reason. On
the Bemboka (N.S.W.) com-
mon may be seen hundreds
of trees which have been
struck. All sorts of trees
have suffered, and the coun-
try is no different from that
surrounding, which seems to
escape. Cattle realise that the
common is a danger area,
and make for the open coun-
try when a thunderstorm
approaches.
“Combo”: “Kooragai” (B. 21/11 /’34)
is only partly right when he says a black
body in the water is not an attractive
mark for fish. It is definitely an un-
attractive mark. I knew a fisherman on
the Barrier in need of bait. We came to
a bit of a pool in the coral. We had a
blackboy with us, and we wanted him to
plunge in and disturb the small fish so
that we might know whether it was worth
while “dragging” that pool. The coon
proved to us that his body was against
the success of such an experiment. As
soon as he hit the whter the small fish
scurried for shelter and remained hidden
all the time he was in. When one of us
went in, and his pink body was noted
by the little fish, they came in
swarms. In their curiosity they nosed
that pink body and fought each other for
dress-circle seats all the time it was
handy. We were told by our black
oracle that the pink body would attract
sharks, while his dark one repelled them ;
but we didn’t try to prove it.

“Bilter Bark”; The sparrow is a spry
and cheeky citizen in its wild state, but
j n a n aviary with finches it shows
itself a coward. It feeds furtively, and
j s always seeking to escape. Like its
fellow-immigrants the starling and Indian
minah, it shows a decided preference for
town life. I have not noticed it north of
Brisbane.
* * * *
“Opalite”; On Christmas Day, dinner
over in the one and only pub, things got
lively. Scottie, complete with bagpipes,
provided a diversion. Rolling up his
trousers we tied a colored towel around
him for a kilt. Two straw bottle-covers
pinned in front made an excellent spor-
ran, and a beret with feathers completed
his Highland rigout. Armed with tins
and brooms, the rest of us, in various
stages of merriment, formed two deep,
and, led by Scottie piping vigorously, with
the publican dexterously twirling a broora-
handle, we marched up and down the
main street. Scottie piped the whole time,
fairly oozing perspiration—or beer—
until we got back, when a disorderly
rabble rushed the bar. All that was seen
of the local John Hop shortly after was
a cloud of dust as he left in his car.
PLOUGHING.
From mountain snows the south wind blows,
A thrush is serenading;
The brown earth flows in ordered rows,
From polished steel cascading.
With toss of head and nostrils spread,
The team is slowly going,
Now up, now down, while furrowed brown
Keeps growing, growing, growing.
The horses strain with clink of chain;
A stone sets discs a-ringing;
A lever snicks, and now the six
In unison are swinging.
The white blades turn through root and fern,
And chatter through the gravel,
While each round brings fresh fluttering wings
To follow where I travel.
From treetops by the bush-birds fly
And scream and wheel and hover,
And squabble for the lavish store
The discs each round uncover.
This land I till may serve me ill,
Or yield beyond my knowing;
But skies are clear and lunch-time’s near,
So “Come on! Keep her going! ”

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
WILLEYING RESULTS.
“Wool Away”: “Murrawong” (B.
12/12/’34) is right about the removal of
Bathurst burr by willeying, but the
machine will not extract Noogoora. I
tried it on some fleeces infested with that
clinging horror, but it was a washout.
“Right Angle” (B. 26/12/’34) is in order
in referring to wools west o’ the Darling
being 50-50, but nobody would advocate
willeying clips of that description. It
is “sandy-back” wools, together with the
dusty, shabby fleeces, locks, stained
pieces and dead wool, that the machine
was designed to treat. During the last
five years 20,000 bales have been put
through payably.
Except in its application to woolgrow-
ing in Australian arid districts, willeying
is not a new process. It has been practised
for ages in many countries. Even China
willeys most of its export wool because
of its sandy and earthy condition.
According to the “Wool and Textile
World”:
At Tientsin many of the larger export
houses have willeying machines. One or
two public-press packers and willeyers
minister to the needs of the other firms,
who are not saddled with this particular
overhead. In the willeying anything up to
50 p.c. of impurities, consisting mostly of
sand, is extracted. Hand-cleaning is also
done by a relay system of coolies standing
on each side of a series of screens passing
wool from hand to hand, shaking it vigor-
ously.
In Goldsbrough Mort’s store, Port
Adelaide, in 1930-31 nearly 3000 bales of
wool were treated, with the following
result:
2801 bales treated, weighing 980,4351 b.
2000 bales returned, weighing 588,2751 b.
392,1601 b.
About 175 tons, or 40 p.c, of original
weight, could have been left on the sta-
tion, thus saving freight and charges, in-
cluding cost of packs, amounting to
£1634.
WATERING SHEEP.
“Lion”: Many people are puzzled at
the quick loss of condition in sheep which
are watered. It is often their own fault.
Points to note are:
Drive the mob to water the same time
each day.
Water every day, if possible, and twice
during severe heat-waves.
When on the tank do not go away and
leave the mob. See that those at the back
get to the front. Often leaders drink,
and then clear off with' many of the
others following. Keep them slowly
circling the tank, and don’t let the dogs
worry them. A quiet and intelligent dog
is required to water sheep properly.
Remember it takes a least half an hour
to water 500 sheep at a 1000 yd. tank
well. Sheep will not always drink as
soon as they arrive.
Always drive them through as little
dust as possible.
Arrange that dry sheep only are
watered, and give them a good paddock.
SHORTER SHEARING.
“Eric”: There is another point against
nine-monthly shearing (B. 2/l/’35). If a
man on the Monaro (N.S.W.) who
usually shears in November started
shearing every nine months, his next cut
would be in September, which is the
month usually chosen for lambing in his
district.
Therefore, he would have to lamb
about June-July, or close enough to
shearing to interfere with lamb-marking.
If he shore again nine months from
September—about June —he would lose
a large percentage of his sheep from
cold and would have his lambing altered
again.
If with Junp shearing he wanted to
lamb in September, his ewes would be
two months gone at the beginning of
shearing. Ewes at that stage will not
stand much handling.
SHEEP LICE.
“Sheepo”: “G.F.D.” (B. 26/12/’34)
says I’m “a bit out in thinking that one
or two sheep left undipped will infest
the whole flock.”
In Victoria I know of one undipped
and lousy sheep that reinfested 2000 ewes
in less than a month.
In scrubby country, sheep missed for
dipping might isolate themselves, thus
failing to contact with clean sheep ; but
let “G.F.D.” put his 10 per cent, of
lousy sheep in a yard or a scrub-free
paddock with dipped sheep and see what
will happen. The whole flock will soon
be reinfested. Graziers in clean Queens-
land areas have pressed for compulsory
dipping in lice areas, but the Govern-
ment is not interested.
It is just waste of time and money to
dip once only. Give the sheep a second
swim 12 or 14 days later.
DIPS AND FLY
“Albarmount”: The clamming of dirt
into the fibre through dip action pro-
duces the tip—this for the benefit of
those who attempt periodical dipping as
a fly-deterrent. Long tips adversely affect
wool appearance. “W.D.McC.’s” infer-
ence that my bath was filthy (B. 9 /1 / ’35)
is ridiculous. I start with crystal-clear
water. After the first few pens, it be-
comes murky enough to produce stain.
My sheep are lifted over a 4in. concrete
wall into the bath —I have found lifting
easier and less dirty than pushing. I
have only one draining pen, and this
allows time to skim the liquid while the
sheep are draining. No more than 2000
are put through before the dip is cleaned.
Anyway, this does not explain why my
sheep were blown a fortnight after dip-
ping. This season I had a ram blown
on the head 18 days after the dip, and
the dip used was a different brand to
that which failed me last time.
“Valerin”: Many woolgrowers dip off
shears. It saves a second mustering, but
seems to me penny wise and pound
foolish.
My experience is that dipping with six
weeks’ to two months’ wool on gives the
best results. The extra fleece retains the
components of the dip longer, kills para-
sites and protects against fly attack.
Later dipping is risky because the
sheep are more likely to get overheated,
when dipping causes staining and pos-
sibly staple breaks.
Besides, a cold snap while the fleeces
are saturated may mean serious loss.
GRASSHOPPER TECHNIQUE.
“X.T.”: The right place to start on
the ’hopper is at the eggbed, and the
right time is now. Eggbeds are not
large at present—*an acre or two at most
—but given a chance where the soil is
suitable they will expand enormously
when existing hordes of “fliers” begin to
breed. I have seen one on the Mespot.
borders a mile or more square.
The swarm settles in dense masses —
about a gross of females to the square
foot. Each lady is armed with a digging
apparatus, and sinks a shaft which may
be from yin. to 3in. deep, according to
the nature of the soil. Usually a bare,
hard spot is chosen, but no place is sacro-
sanct. She then lays her eggs in a secre-
tion in the hole and seals it with a
special fluid. Each hole may carry a
couple of dozen eggs—sometimes more.
Locust ladies may lay more than one
batch of eggs—they live a limit of six
weeks.
When a bed is found, it is not good
technique to disturb the ladies on the job.
If you do, most of them leave for the
horizon and lay elsewhere.
Don’t worry to break up the beds —
ploughing does little good. Wait till the
’hoppers emerge, young and trustful, and
then toss them a nice helping of poison
bait before they begin to take wing—
bran 4201 b., soda arsenite 91b., molasses
751 b. and water 28 gallons make a good
porridge.
Put two-thirds of the water and the
molasses into a tub; Put three gallons
of water into each of three buckets and
stir 31 b. of arsenite of soda into each
bucket till dissolved. Then add the
contents of the buckets to the tub and
mix well.
Pour the bran out in 1101 b. lots on
the floor and mix eight gallons of poison
solution into each bagload with a shovel,
as if mixing cement. When finished, it
should be flaky and not lumpy.
This is the Victorian recipe. Spread
in the early morning within 24 hours of
mixing. To protect crops, use 601 b. for
a strip 15 yards wide and 15 chains long ;
otherwise, 601 b. to the acre.
“K.Mc.”: Fifty years ago, before the
rabbits came, there were ’hopper and
insect plagues, which birds are supposed
to keep in check. Yet “F.8.L.” digs up
the old threadbare tale of the great loss
of valuable bird life through rabbit
poisoning (B. 9/l/’35).
I grew up with the poison-cart, and
where it had been run twice yearly for
20 years I saw schoolboys get £5 per
week catching ’possums the phosphorus-
pollard baits were supposed to have ex-
terminated. During this time there was
no noticeable variation in the number
of birds, nor is there, now after the
poison-cart has been superseded by traps
and thistle roots for 12 years.
Those who have young ’hoppers would
do well to pay scant heed to such “cold-
water” statements and get the poison
bran or spray to work ; otherwise there
soon may be little left for man, bird or
beast.
N. S. WALES FARMING PROGRESS.
“El V.”: For all the education doled
out to the farmer, the new silos, the
fertiliser propaganda and the bonuses,
N. S. Wales does not seem to get along
much faster in agriculture than it used to.
Fifteen years ago there were 542,000
dairy cows in the State, and the average
production of milk was 444 gallons, of
commercial butter 1551 b., and of cheese
121 b. per cow over the whole dairy popu-
lation in average daily milk.
According to the just-issued Depart-
ment of Agriculture 1933-34 report, there
are now 722,000 dairy cows in the State
in average daily milk. Their output of
milk per cow is exactly the same as it
was in 1920-21, but their butter average
has improved 221 b. per cow. Cheese pro-
duction has gone down to 9.91 b. per cow.
The butter improvement is probably due
rather to the fact that there are more
cows producing cream than that the fat
percentage has increased.
The department itself has some fine
exhibits of dairy cattle. Its record for
the year was made with a Jersey heifer
which produced 15,4471 b. of milk and
10701 b. of commercial butter —the first
time a heifer has made over 10001 b. of
butter in Australia. The performance
was short of the world’s record by only
141 b. Two other cows at Hawkesbury,
owned by the Government, made over
10001 b. of commercial butter, and the
herd of 55 cows at Wollongbar averaged
6571 b. of milk and 3851 b. of butter.
These records are abnormal, but it
ought to be possible to drag the butter
production average up to 2501 b. per cow,
which would mean that 515,000 cows
could produce what 721,000 are now pro-
ducing.
The N.S.W. acreage under crop has
increased in 14 years from 4,467,000 to
6,332,000. Maize shows a falling off —
144.000 acres to 113,000; hay also—from
854.000 to 645,000 acres ; but green feed
(lucerne, etc.) has increased threefold.
The value of agricultural production last
year was estimated at £17,474,000. The
average yield per acre was only
£2 15s. 2d., against the average for
the past 10 years of £3 Bs. 2d. Im-
provements of yields, both of land
and cattle, and improvement of quality
of produce would relieve the farmers of
a large slice of capital burden.
MORE BINDER-KNOTTER HINTS.
“A.G.T.”: Add to “Hope Vale’s” list
(B. 12/12/’34) the following; When the

£25 FOR SUCCESS STORIES.
Mostly Australia hears of her farming failures, but there are many men
on the land who have a romantic record of success—men who started out,
with little capital, on rough scrub land, and made good despite low prices,
bad communications and high taxes; men who bought properties on which
others had failed and made them pay; men who began with nothing but
stock knowledge as capital and turned it to good account; men to whom
pasture improvement has brought a competence.
“The Bulletin” is offering prizes for stories of success in any branch
of farming, written by the parties themselves or by others to whom the facts
have been communicated. If the latter, proofs of genuineness must be
furnished.
First prize £2O
Second prize £3
Third prize £2
And ten “Bulletin” drawings by well-known artists. Space rates will
be paid for all non-prizewinning efforts published.
A story must not exceed eight hundred words in length. It must be
sent in an envelope addressed to the Editor and marked “Success Competition”
not later than January 31 next. The Editor’s decisions and awards will
be Bnal.

making repairs, if frequently happens
that it is reassembled a link “late” on the
driving cog. This prevents the twine
needle from going far enough past the
knotter, and the knotter does not grip
the twine in correct “time.”
A similar effect is sometimes produced
by wear in the needle-drive connecting-
rod, which is usually provided with one
screwed end, and should be shortened
by screwing into the socket, to hold the
needle up to a higher position.
WHEAT AND F.A.Q.
“Nanai”; The W.A. Director of Agri-
culture, Mr. Sutton, has pointed out to
his Government that the low quality of
f.a.q. wheat “is causing serious concern
in the Eastern States,” that some wheat
has been unsaleable in the British market,
that the position is “extremely serious.”
Mr. Sutton recommends that the W.A.
department should determine a standard
for all varieties —not less than the quality
of Gluyas Early No. 2.
It is an old grievance. When N.S.W.
Agricultural Minister Dunn visited Bri-
tain in 1926 the matter cropped up at
every port he visited. Not only
was the quality impugned, but the sam-
pling, which, it was said, often did not
represent the bulk. British wheatbuyers
spoke very strongly, and they have been
speaking strongly ever since, both about
quality and the size of cargoes, which
are usually of one variety, instead of in
sufficient variety to make a milling blend
of the whole shipment.
A big school is growing up which be-
lieves that the f.a.q. system should be
abandoned.
AFTER-HARVEST TIPS.
“F.L.8.”: immediately the harvest
ends open up all the elevator boxes and
slowly run the header in order to clean
out all foreign matter. Next open up
the header drum and thoroughly clean
every groove in the concave, and all
round the drum itself.
If left only two days in hot weather
this job takes four times as long. Un-
fasten the elevators from the spirals to
drum, but be careful to note how they
come off. They are easily replaced back
to front.
Clean the knife and between the fingers
with a stiff brush and water. Grease
as soon as dry.
Next, remove all sieves and clean out
wheat left in the shaker box. Do the
same with the chickwheat sieves and
brushes and box ; and also the main box.
Remove all belts and put them, rolled
up, into the wheat box with the elevators
and any other things that have been
removed.
The whole job takes a capable man
about half a day or less, and prevents a
heap of trouble later, especially from
rats. Lastly run the cleaned machine
under cover from the weather,
WHEAT PICKLING.
“The 0.D.”; Is “Sorghum” serious
(B. 26/12/’34)? Not one wheatgrower
in a hundred uses anything else but the
dry copper carbonate method for the
prevention of bunt. If there are any
bluestone and lime and formalin advo-
cates left they should get out of wheat-
growing.
To sow oats in a smutty paddock is
only making things worse. Oats are just
as susceptible to smut as wheat. Fallow
the paddock for a couple of years, and
keep it clean.
Nabawa gained its popularity because
of its resistance to smut; Gurkha has
not yet proved itself in N.S.W. —it is a
Vic. breed. But Nabawa is being dis-
placed by Dundee, which is almost its
equal as a smut-resister, is a better
yielder, gives a stronger grain, and stands
up to rough weather where Nabawa goes
down.
This season, late attacks of take-all did
great damage. Where that has occurred,
sow oats in the stubble, then fallow,
then sow your wheat.
CUTTING PINEAPPLES.
“Cockyson”: Many a promising pine-
apple patch has been ruined through
careless harvesting. Fruit should be cut,
not broken, from the plant. Snapping
the fruit off, the entire stem remains.
This will throw out suckers, stunting the
main fruit-bearers, which should always
strike from close to the ground.
The fruit-stem suckers will produce,
but the fruit is often too small to market.
A long-handled or long-bladed knife
should be used, the fruit stem being cut
as low as possible. This ensures a growth
of vigorous suckers. The stem, which
must be snapped off at its junction with
the fruit, is easily removed when the
pine is off the plant.
Pines are very susceptible of sunburn.
In hot weather all exposed fruits should
be protected from the direct rays of the
midday sun by grass, bushes or paper.
Particularly must all pines growing at a
slant be protected.
Only one slight touch of the sun ren-
ders a pine unmarketable,
LIFTING POSTS.
“Timothy Tywire”: I can tell
“Sprinkler” (B. 19/12/’34) that downs-
country fences do sometimes need resink-
ing, even when properly erected. The
surface of the loose, ashy ground my
tence crosses has fallen inches in the last
few years thanks to long dry spells, dust-
lifting winds and sheep pads on both
sides. When the ground gets a soaking,
however, a few blows on the top of
each post with a heavy mallet fixes
matters,
“Red Wul”: Fence .posts in downs
country will lift if not properly rammed.
Ram tightly the first 9in. or 12in., lightly
for the next six and then throw dirt in
loosely up to ground level. On no
account build a mound around the post.
Anyone who has seen a sheepyard being
flooded to lay dust will know why. The
soil rises, like a cooking cake, four or
five inches as it becomes saturated. The
grip of tightly-packed dirt swelling with
rain pulls the post out.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Airline”: When ringbarking big iron-
bark it is next to impossible to frill-ring
it, owing to the hardness and thickness of
the bark. The most effective ring is a
chip-ring with plenty of inward slant on
the bottom cut, forming a deep frill,
which, by holding water and waste, soon
rots the bark and ensures a good kill.
“Agri”: An easy method of greasing
the turntable of a grain waggon; When
loading place the first seven or eight
bags right at the back of the waggon. This
lifts the upper turntable slides about 2in.
above the lower, and the whole can be
easily lubricated.
“Tockilly”: If straight billets are re-
quired or the log is too tough to burst,
strike two parallel lines along it about
2in. apart, or wider if a deeper groove
is needed. Chop small cuts at right-
angles to and joining the lines, then chop
the wood out in a “V” groove between
the parallel lines. An old broad-axe
with a straight handle makes an excel-
lent grooving axe,
“Valerin”: To prevent ants getting on
tables, shelves and into safes soak in a
saturated solution of corrosive sublimate
tape an inch wide. Let it dry, and then
fasten it around the legs of the furniture,
etc. If the tape remains dry it will keep
off ants for months.
“Wongi”; Try making your wooltable
with round or octagonal battens, rounded
at the ends to revolve in scalloped false
sides fastened inside the table frame. All
locks lying on table after the fleece has
been rolled are dropped between the re-
volving battens by simply running a hand
along.
“Wrash”: To stop the up-and-down
swing of the sawblade when crosscutting
a tree single-handed unbolt the handle-
grip and to the bolt-hole tie a springy
stick the height of your cut. With one
end of the stick on the ground the saw
should run level.
“A.G.T.”: When a belt-lace breaks in
the field a substitute can be made of
wire clips. Make staples of about 10-
gauge wire and insert in the lace holes
across the belt. Hammer the ends down
tightly on the outside of the belt.
“Gumblegubbin”: A sheepskin can be
quickly cured by spreading a thin layer
of baking soda on the fleshy side. When
dry, rub off loose soda, and the skin will
remain soft and white.

ADVICE FROM THE EXPERTS.
“Players could often do worse than act on
(he barrackers’ advice.”— “Sun.”
At a recent cricket match I witnessed
they decided to follow it to the letter.
Acting on the Hillites’ advice, the cap-
tain of the home team put the visitors in.
In his first over Dongem obeyed the
demands of the crowd and skittled the
opening batsmen. Then after the visi-
tors’ supporters awoke to the situation
the bowlers had their hides belted off
and the fieldsmen their legs run off. The
fielding captain was kept busy changing
his bowlers, giving the wicket-keeper an
“Hey, Bill! It’s only me.”
over, putting the umpire on and sending
telegrams to Jack Gregory, while the
outfield was soon littered with chaffbags
and circus tents. Several times the fire
brigade dashed on to the arena. The
batsmen hit nearly every ball for six, and
proceeded to eat the bowlers alive. One
batsman, who was apparently rather
deaf, ignored the instruction, and was
deliberately stonewalling. He was quite
nonplussed when his opponents com-
menced bowling him up a water-
melon. No lunch or tea intervals
were taken, and stumps were not drawn
until long after dark. A well-known bar-
racker told me it was the best game he’d
ever seen.

ANOTHER NAZI VICTORY.
• X* l6 The Gold Rush’ has been banned

History is full of examples of men
who have climbed to power on the backs
of others and have then kicked their
stepping-stones away. German history
is particularly rich in such cases, the
most famous being Wilhelm 11. and Bis-
marck.
Hitler is the latest ladder-climber to
kick away the man to whom he owes
everything. There is only room in Ger-
many for one moustache like that, there-
fore Chaplin must go.

“It has been suggested that when Westralia
secedes Scotland should adopt a territory her
own size in W.A. and there develop industries
at which she is most efficient.” — Cable.
There will be anew meaning to the
old question “Stands Scotland where she
stood?” when New Scotland stands in
the middle of the Great Sandy Desert.
The idea conjures up an inspiring pic-
ture of anew nation of sturdy clansmen
clad in home-spun kilts, growing their
own haggis and tending their own herds
of usquebaughs. At night the plaintive
notes of the bagpipes (wallaby-skin) will
mingle not unmusically with the eerie
cries of the mopoke and bullroarer, while
under the beneficent influence of heather
ale (antipodean brand), the gudemen (not
fou, but merely crouse and canty) will
tell tales of Auld Reekie, and the bairns
will play bogles amang the wee bit salt-

DIARY OF A PAWNBROKER WHO

FOREWARNED.
It’s just as well that the father of
Sticker’s girl is a golf maniac. He hates
Sticker like poison, and times out of
number has tried to say it with kicks.
So far he has failed. You see, every
time the old boy makes a mad rush to
connect with his boot, his golfing obses-
sion overcomes him and he yells “Fore!”
That does Sticker. He gets away to a
good start.

PISCATORIAL PRUDENCE.
“ ‘There are lots of people who committed
indiscretions last year who would not have
done so if they had been fishing,’ says a
Sydney cleric.”
Quite so. If I had stuck to fishing on
the 52 Saturday afternoons in 1934 I
would be approximately £5 4s. better off
to-day—2s. per week (surreptitiously
extracted from the pay envelope before
the missus closed on it), my average
contribution to the S.P. Bookmakers’
Benevolent Fund.
On the other hand, if I had been fish-
ing instead of working (Mondays to
Fridays inclusive) I would not have pos-
sessed the aforementioned sum to
squander.
Still, levity aside, the merits of ang-
ling as a preventive against imprudence
are undeniable. I shall always regret
that I wasn’t fishing on the day when
first I met my wife.

CROCODILE TEARS.
Mrs. loops was obviously suffering
under the stress of suppressed emotion
when her neighbor, Mrs. Dudde, called
in the other morning.
“Whatever is the matter, dearie?” ex-
claimed Mrs. D. “You look all worked
up.”
“It’s my husband. He’s run off with
another woman! Oh, I —I can hardly
control myself!”
Mrs. D. patted her heaving shoulders.
“Don’t try to, dearie,” she said sooth-
ingly. “You’ll feel miles better when
you’ve had a good laugh!”

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
XVIII. — THE CONDUCTOR.
What a life the trammie leads,
Out in rain and hail and heat!
Grabs our coppers, tears our tickets,
Takes us furlongs past our street.
See him balanced on the footboard.
Holding on with teeth and knees,
Thrusting through the jostling thousands,
Tearing off the “twos” and “threes.”
“What’s that, ma’am ? He’s just a baby ?
Blime, not with them big knees !
That’ll be another penny —
Let ’er go, Alf. Fares I Fez, please!”
Conductors are of three kinds—band,
tram and lightning. The first are born,
the last are made. Tram conductors
happen both ways, but it’s not their fault
in either case.
Band conductors are men with hyp-
notic eyes, gorgeous uniforms and St.
Vitus’s dance. They wave a stick around
in front of a band until the performers
are too dazed to play any longer. They
then bring the
stick down with
a sudden flour-
ish and the
band immedi-
ately stops.
This is much
appreciated by
th e audience,
and nearly
always wins
loud applause.
The conduc-
tor is the only
man in the band
who doesn’t
earn his pay.
The bandsmen
puff and blow,
while he just
stands about
waving his
arms; yet he
has the nerve to
take all the ap-
plause at the
finish.
The best way
to deal with a
band conductor
is to catch him
young and
break him of
the habit. If
the effort proves
fruitless, give
him a baton and
let him go right
ahead in the
hope that sooner
or later one of
the bandsmen
will smother him in his double bass.
So much for band conductors.
Lightning conductors don’t interest us
much either. Human beings are seldom
called upon to act in this capacity, and
never more than once.
Tram conducting is a different matter.
It is a mistake to expect to start a
young lad off as a tram conductor right
away. The profession is too many-sided.
It’s not just a matter of collecting fares,
pulling cords and saying “Let ’er go,
Alf.”
First of all a couple of years on the
flying trapeze or at least the tightrope is
essential before he can hope to be able
to balance himself on the footboards.
An Antarctic expedition is the best way
to test his ability to stand up to the rigors
of winter.
Then he must thoroughly master the
geography of his city and must learn to
couple this knowledge to a proper under-
standing of psychology, so that when (for
instance) a woman asks for Wilson-street
and adds “with the pillar-box on the
corner,” he will at once realise that she
really wants to be out down at Avoca-
avenue just oppo-
site the fire-sta-
tion. This sort of
thing takes a long
time to pick up.
A thorough
course in account-
ancy is handy,
though not essen-
tial. The wise
trammie puts in a
year or so as bank-
teller and finds the
experience invalu-
able, as he is able
to bend doubtful
coins with his
fingers instead of
biting them. This
saves time, is more
hygienic and leaves
the mouth free for
other duties.
Thus equipped he is ready for almost
anything that can come his way, though
it is always handy to have a couple of
extra languages up his sleeve, as he never
knows when he may find himself in a
strange suburb.
One conductor who had been on Syd-
ney trams almost since their inception
and had jogged along on English found
himself not long ago stranded in Surry
Hills.
Being unfamiliar with the language he
charged 3d. for a 2d. section. His throat
has never been the same since.

(1) Was Lawrence Hargrave born in Aus-
tralia ? (2) Date and place of his death ?
(3) Particulars of his work in connection with
aviation ? —5157.
(1) No; he was born in England in 1850.
He migrated to Australia in 1866. (2) July 6,
1915, at Sydney. (3) Whilst assistant at the
Sydney Observatory he studied the mechanism
of bird flight. From 1884 to 1892 he experi-
mented with kites and monoplane models.
The motive power of his ’planes was first
clockwork, then rubber bands in tension, com-
pressed air, and finally steam. His work gave
a world-wide stimulus to the study of aero-
dynamics. He described in 1889 the principle
of a rotary engine in which shaft and crank-
pin are stationary while the cylinders revolve.
The Gnome and Rhone engines were later built
on this principle. In 1892 he experimented, by
means of kites, on curved surfaces, from which
he obtained a greater lift. The first aeroplane
that ever flew publicly, that of Santos-Dumont
in France in 1906, was an adaptation of the
Hargrave box-kite.
Best bait-and-line method for catching river
mullet in Dean River (N.S.W.) 20 miles from
sea ?— 5072.
If the common mullet ( Mugil cephalus) is
the species referred to, it will never take a bait,
for its food consists of diatoms and other
microscopic life, which it strains from the water
on the surface of the mud or sand. The
smaller sand-mullet (Myxus elongatus) will take
a dough bait.
(1) How did takings by “a certain” Slate
lottery compare last financial year with the
year before ? (2) How much has been paid
into Consolidated Revenue from the lottery ?
—5136.
In the period 1933-34 70 lotteries were filled
and 71 drawn, as compared with 78 filled and
81 drawn during 1932-33. Receipts from the
sale of lottery tickets amounted to £1,847,763
155., compared with £2,054,982 6s. Net sur-
plus: £641,191 4s. 3d. in 1933-34, £722,164
ss. Bd. in 1932-33 and £698,039 3s. lid. in
1931-32. (2) £2,247,868 7s. 6d.. of which
£747,203 7s. 6d. was transferred to Consoli-
dated Revenue in 1931-32, £804,190 in 1932-33
and £696,475 in 1933-34.
What is the meaning of the world sophisti-
cated ? Webster describes it as being adulter-
ated or corrupt. Is this what is meant when
cinema stars are referred to in puffs or criti-
cisms as sophisticated ? —5031.
In current usage, a sophisticated person is
a man or woman “of the world” —the antithesis
of trusting innocence; not necessarily one who
employs sophistries, but who can see through
them. It is a case of a word regaining its
original meaning, for, according to its Greek
root, sophistry is merely wisdom. The logic-
twisters who called themselves sophists gave the
word its sinister meaning.
What is the allusion in the following passage
from a sub-leader headed “Alice” in the
“Times Weekly” of Nov. 22, 1934: “An even
sadder history gives the vital core of feeling,
hidden but never quenched, to the fun of the
‘Just So Stories’ ” ? —5083.
This refers to Kipling’s son John, for whom
the stories were written, and who was killed
in action. The “never quenched” relates to
Kipling’s “The Irish Guards in the Great War.”
His son was in that regiment.
(1) Grandparents (both sides) of the Duchess
of Kent ? (2) Relationship between Prince
George of Greece and ex-King George of
Greece ? (3) Who is Princess Helena Victoria ?
(4) In what way is the Queen of Denmark re-
lated to the British royal family? —slo7.
(1) King George I. of Greece (1845-1913)
and Queen Olga (1851-1926); and the parents
of Helene-Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of
Russia. (2) Prince George is uncle of the ex-
King. (3) Daughter of Princess Helena Augusta
Victoria, and granddaughter of Queen Victoria.
(4) Through Queen Alexandra, late Queen ot
England, eldest daughter of Christian IX.,
King of Denmark.
(1) What is Valhalla ? (2) What are the Val-
kyries ?— 5179.
(1) In Scandinavian mythology, Valhalla is
the great hall of the gods to which warriors
slain in battle may attain. It is entered by
540 doors, through each of which 800 warriors
could march abreast, and the hereafter is de-
picted as a time of heroic combat and feasting.
(2) The Valkyries are supernatural maidens
of great beauty who transport the slain heroes
to Valhalla and there minister to their comfort.
(1) Does Sydney Uni. conduct a correspond-
ence course ? (2) Can a non-matriculated
student obtain a degree ? (3) Is there a Uni-
versity College at Canberra ; and, if so, what
subjects can be taken ? —5099.
(1) No. (2) No. (3) One has just been estab-
lished. Information as to courses may be
obtained from the Secretary to the College,
Canberra.
(1) Is the Q’land junior exam, of a higher
standard than the intermediate of N.S.W.? (2)
Average ages for boys and girls to sit for Slate

English textbooks were set in 1934 for Q’land
junior exam. ? (5) Is the Q’land scholarship
exam, in mathematics on a par with the N.S.W.
intermediate ? —5096.
(1) Yes. (2) and (3) No age limitations.
(4) “Macbeth,” “English Verse” • (Vol. V,
World’s Classics), Parnwell’s “Personal
Adventure and Romance,” Goldsmith’s “The
Vicar of Wakefield,” Jane Austen’s “Pride and
Prejudice,” Thackeray’s “Esmond” and “The
Newcomes,” Dickens’s “A Tale of Two Cities”
and “Great Expectations,” George Eliot’s “Silas
Marner,” Mrs. Gaskell’s “Cranford,” Wilkie
Collins’s “The Moonstone,” Stevenson’s
“Master of Ballantrae.” Charles Reade’s “It Is
Never Too Late to Mend” and Meredith’s
“Diana of the Crossways.” (5) No.
(1) When is the canecutting season in Queens-
land ? (2) How can one get a job canecutting ?
—4732.
(1) The season commences generally in the
northern part of the State early in June, and in
the Bundaberg and Nambour areas in July,
continuing usually until early in December.
(2) All labor is engaged on the spot. Secre-
tary, Sugar Producers’ Assoc., 129 Adelaide-
street, Brisbane, might be able to advise as to
whom to apply to.
(1) Why will an ordinary suction pump not
lift water more than 25 ft. vertical height ? (2)
Does this figure vary at different heights above
sea level ? —5082.
(1) If the pump could produce a perfect
vacuum the water would rise 34ft. up the
suction pipe due to the air pressure of 14.71 b.
per square inch on the water surface of the
well. The vacuum with an ordinary pump
is imperfect, and the water rises to a height of
25 to 27 feet. (2) The height which water can
be lifted is reduced in proportion to the height
above sea level.
Composition of carborundum ? —5144.
It is a carbide of silicon prepared by heating
sand with coke in an electric furnace. Pure
carborundum is colorless, but commercial car-
borundum is grejy brown or black from the
presence of impurities. -It is exceptionally hard
and a better abrasive than emery.
What is a lascar ? —5148.
Originally a native Indian soldier or member
of a lashkar (Hindustani for fighting force).
Later came to mean a native camp-follower,
and now applied to natives of India serving on
British ships.
What is nervous debility ? How is it deter-
mined in, medical diagnosis? —sls3.
In nervous debility the nerve symptoms are
pronounced, and may completely control the
physical state. Its manifestations are fatigue
after moderate mental effort, loss of memory
and the power of concentration and irritability
of temper. The condition may reveal itself
by a fixity of the facial lines of expression, a
tremor of the hands, and an excessive response
to an external influence, fright, etc. The sub-
ject is troubled with recurring headaches of
considerable severity. Nervous debility has
many causes; it may be the sequel to an
exhausting illness, mental worry or chronic
toxic lesions (internal). In all cases treatment
depends upon initial cause.
What is the use of limewater in medicine ?
What is the adult dose? —slso.
Lime is assimilated in variable quantity as
required by the system throughout life; the
intake decreases with age. Limewater is a
useful vehicle of administration to children;
its addition to new milk frequently enables
such diet to be tolerated by infants. Lime
assists nutrition and constructive metabolism,
and is therefore essential to the growing child.
That which is organically combined in green
vegetables and the like is most readily con-
verted. Average adult dose of limewater is
two tablespoons with milk or water thrice daily.
How is asthma-paper prepared ? What medi-
cation may be used other than stramonium?
—5162.
Asthma-paper (unmedicated) is prepared with
a 20-per cent, (approx.) solution of potassium
nitrate of water. Dissolve 4oz. nitre powder
in 1 pint boiling water, and saturate white
blotting-paper in this solution when cool. Dry
and press or iron out flat; then cut to a suitable
size. Medicated asthma-papers may be impreg-
nated with sage, belladonna, digitalis and
stramonium, the leaves of these medicaments
being infused for a preliminary soak before
proceeding as above.
/ have a rash on my foot. It consists of a
number of small red pimples or blisters. When
these dry, the skin peals off in thick flakes,
leaving the wrinkles inflamed-looking. The
blisters never break and are not sore, but are
occasionally itchy. It seems worse when I
swim much. Remedy ? —4957.
You suffer from foot eczema, a skin dis-
order similar to tropical ringworm. Sea-bathing
aggravates the trouble. Keep the part dry,
cleanse as required with olive oil, and apply
the following ointment at night: Prepared cala-
mine 10 grains, bismuth subgallate 20 grains,
powdered chloretone 10 grains, zinc cream to
1 ounce. Smear on sparingly, and do not bind.
Dust freely with zinc and starch powder (equal
parts) during the day. Examination advised if
trouble persists.
Does one’s health influence the growth of
sties on the human eye ? lam inclined to be
ancemic and have sties, mostly on the left eye.
Can you suggest a remedy ?-— 4983.
Although simple sty may be associated with
anaemia, the initial lesion develops in a local
germ infection. If pus is present, foment and
evacuate the abscess with a small poultice or
warm boric acid compress. Remove the affected
lash if noted, and treat dandruff of the scalp,
which may convey infection. Meanwhile, use
Golden Eye ointment as an antiseptic, the un-
guent to be smeared along the lid margins at
night.
Can you tell me anything about (1) the
Chesterfield group and (2) Futuna Islands, out-
lying islands of New Caledonia ? —5143.
(1) Group consists of 11 coral islets, 285
miles to the westward of the Huon Islands,
north-west of New Caledonia. The islets vary
in size from half a mile to \\ miles in length,
comprise about 250 acres altogether, and con-
tain rich deposits of guano—not less than
750,000 tons. They are leased from the French
Government by the Austral Guano Co., of
Melbourne. They are well wooded and low-
lying. No native population. (2) The two
small islands of Futuna and Alofi were annexed
by France in 1888, and lie 300 miles north-
east of the Fiji group. Futuna is about Si-
miles long and five miles across, and rises to
2500 feet. Alofi, five miles south-east of
Futuna, is six miles long and three miles across.
Both islands are densely wooded, well watered
and very beautiful. Native population about
1600.
(1) How to burn wood to make charcoal for
use as fuel for a suction-gas plant ? (2) Address
of firm that displayed the McComas water-
lifter at the Melbourne Agricultural Show ?
—5050.
(1) Remove the top of a 44-gallon oil-drum,
cut four holes in the bottom and fill with 4ft.
split timber. The drum or drums, if more
than one is used, are placed over a small
trench to permit a draught passing up through
the wood, which is set alight. When the fire
is burning freely the drums are turned upside
down until the smoke clears off; they are
then smothered, and when out the charcoal
is riddled. It is then ready for use. (2) Mc-
Comas and Co., 545-49 Little Collins-street,
Melbourne.
How' would the earth appear viewed from
other planets ? Would it be a shining body or
not?— sl4l.
It would appear much like any other planet
does to us. If Mars were inhabited, the Mar-
tians would see the earth much as we see their
planets except that we, being of greater mag-
nitude, would appear bigger. As our illumi-
nation is only borrowed from the sun, our
brightness would vary according to the area of
illumined surface presented to the observer, just
as the. moon ,or Venus varies to us from a thin
crescent of light to the full circle, dependent
on the relative positions of earth, sun and
observer.
(1) Who wrote the British National Anthem ?
(2) Did the author write any other well-known
music? (3) Is it a fact that other countries
use the tune of our National Anthem? —5166.
(1) and (2) Not known. It has been credited
to Dr. John Bull (died 1628) and Henry Carey
(died 1743), but evidence available shows
they were merely borrowers. (3) Yes. It has
national significance in Denmark, in Prussia
(“Heil dir inf Siegerkranz”), in the U.S.A.
(“My Country, Tis of Thee”) and in Switzer-
land.
(1) Who composed “Maritana” ? (2) Was
the composer ever in Australia, and what was
his occupation when here ? (3) Was “Maritana”
composed in, Australia ? (4) Where and when
was the opera first produced ? (5) Date of
the composer’s death ? —5172.
William Vincent Wallace, born at Water-
ford, in Ireland, on July 1, 1813. He was
the son of a bandmaster of the Queen’s Own
regiment. (2) Yes, in August, 1835, on account
of poor health. He took up sheepfarming in
N.S.W., but while on a visit to Sydney in 1836
he gave several concerts. He left Sydney in
February, 1838, visiting Tasmania and Maori-
land. (3) Parts of it were. There is a
legend that “Scenes That Are Brightest” was
inspired by Sydney Harbor. (4) At Drury
Lane, London, on November 15, 1845, where
it was a great success. (5) October 12, 1865.
Cooling compound for hot bearings? —sl7s.
Mercurial ointment mixed with black
cylinder-oil and applied every quarter of an
hour or as often as expedient is the usual
formula. For heavy bearings use tallow, 21b.;
plumbago, 60z.; sugar of lead, 4oz. Melt the
tallow with gentle heat, and add the other
ingredients, stirring until cold.
(1) Who is Paul Eldridge, collaborator with
George Sylvester Viereck in “My First Two
Thousand Years” ? (2) Is he a Jew? (3) Is
Viereck a Jew ? —5152.
(1) A schoolmaster in New York, writer of
poetry and fiction. (2) Yes. (3) No.
I have a blue Egyptian stamp containing
a drawing of a man with the head oj' a bird.
Underneath are inscribed the words “Congres
International de Geographic.” What does this
figure represent ? —4992.
This stamp, together with two other values,
was issued to celebrate the International Geo-
graphical Congress, Cairo, in 1925. The figure
depicted on the stamp represents Thoth, with
the head of an ibis.

“McGregor”: The big boom which
Egon Kisch has given to Gaelic has
brought out the fact that the Scottish
wireless patrols in Canada use this
language for their confidential mes-
sages. Never yet has there been
found a gangster who can translate
Gaelic, and therefore the patrols have
no fear of their messages being picked up
and turned to account by the enemy.
But this security is unlikely to last. The
dean of the faculty in the gangsters’ uni-

culum.

“General Prac.”: The Mayo clinic (B.
12 /12/’34) has directly caused the growth
of Rochester (Minn.) from a hamlet into
a city of 25,000 people. The clinic itself
is housed in a 30-storey skyscraper
wherein are 450 doctors and 830 assorted
assistants, clerks, stenographers. At the
box-office, so to speak, a tactful lady,
after eliciting information about one’s
health, etc., issues a numbered ticket
which entitles the patient to whizz up
to the 20th floor and back to the base-
ment, interviewing various specialists by
the way. After three days of this, during
which the patient has been swished up
and down in “elevators” and undergone
all kinds of analysis, the investigation is
over. He is a hospital case ; so to hospi-
tal he goes, by underground tunnel —for
there is often snow about in Minnesota.
The magnificent dossier of specialists’
reports accompanies him thither by
pneumatic tube. From 50,000 to 60,000
people a year are cured at Rochester,
and prices are strictly moderate,

“Limey”; In a recent account of
Anson’s voyage round the world,
Admiral Boyle-Somerville explodes a
cherished obsession- —that limejuice was
an infallible preventive of scurvy, in
Anson’s time and for long after the
most terrible peril of the sea on long
voyages. The value of fresh food of any
sort, especially fresh fruit, was early
recognised. Long after Anson’s day
some experimenter suggested the use of
the juice of lemons. The first trials
were made with the extract of Mediter-
ranean lemons. These contain the vita-
min the absence of which is the cause
of scurvy. Later the Admiralty, finding
the lemons hard to come by, switched
over on to West Indian limes, of which
there was an unlimited supply. Lacking
the magic vitamin, this limejuice, later
to be a compulsory ration in the mer-
chant service, was as useless against
scurvy as bilgewater. Yet it maintained
its reputation for close on 100 years be-
fore the delusion was exposed.

“Linen Rag”: The bogus banknotes
that have been occasionally so much
trouble in London (B. 26/12/’34) are
imitations of the “Bradbury” £1 and 10s.
issues, and not the sacrosanct Bank of Eng-
land notes proper. The lowest denomina-
tion of the latter is a fiver. It is no tradi-
tion about that Bank of England paper.
This is made of special material in a
little country mill which is more heavily
guarded than Stalin. The paper is
uniquely watermarked by a process which
has never been imitated, and the black
ink is also a special secret. Many at-
tempts have been made to forge these
notes, but the first imitation to reach the
bank has always blown the gaff. The
Americans seek immunity from forgery
by mixing shreds of red, blue and green
silk floss with the paper-pulp of their
notes and by elaborate machine-engrav-
ing. Both call for careful inspection by
the handler, and that way is seldom pos-
sible. The B. of E. notes are so plain
and simple that to anyone accustomed to
them forgery proclaims itself.

Hitler has banned Chaplin’s films on

He bases his ukase largely on the fact
that Chaplin first appeared in an East

East End audiences consist largely of the

In Dublin he might have appeared as
Patsy O’Leary. On a Thames island near

CAR AND RADIO IN NOVEL TEST.
CHRYSLER SIX AND A.W A. AUTO RADIO PUT THROUGH
THEIR PACES BY “BULLETIN” EXPERTS.
By FRED BERRY.
/\ TEST of car and radio performance, simultaneously
7*- conducted under extremely exacting conditions, was made
in the case of a new Chrysler streamlined sedan supplied by
York Motors, N.S.W. distributors, and a new-type car radio
receiver lent by Amalgamated Wireless (Aust.), Ltd. Don B.
Knock, “The Bulletin’s’ ’ radio editor, supervised the test of
radio equipment, and his comments appear in another column.
With regard to the performance of the
car, the Chrysler upheld its name for
speed, comfort and ease of operation.
Driving this machine gives one a sense of
comfort and security—the true “big-car”
effect. On the other hand, steering is so
light and definite and suspension so well
Neat, graceful and efficient. The new Chrysler Six streamlined sedan, tested
recently over THE BULLETIN course.
designed that the car can be handled
with the same ease and facility as the
lightest of sports tourers.
Another pleasing feature is extreme
silence in operation, for so thoroughly
has vibration been eliminated that even
when developing full revs, the faintest
of radio signals was clearly audible.
Diagrammatic section of Chrysler inde-
pendent front-wheel suspension. Note
both tyres remaining in vertical plane
while passing over obstruction.
The motor is suspended in the chassis
by Chrysler patented floating-power
mounting, using live rubber supports;
consequently the engine oscillates on its
axis in absorbing power thrust instead
of transmitting these shocks to chassis and
body. Of L-head type, the six-cylinder
engine, bore 3fin., stroke 4iin., has a
swept capacity of 241.5 cub. in. R.A.C.
rating is 27.34 h.p., but at 3400 revs.,
using a compression ratio of 5.4 to 1,
93 b.h.p. is developed. Aluminium-alloy
T-slot pistons, each fitted with four rings
located above the floating gudgeon pin,
are used. Valves, side-by-side type, are
of special heat-resisting steel, the exhausts
being provided with case-hardened inserts
shrunk into the cylinder block. This
principle, it is claimed, increases valve
life and avoids the necessity of frequent
grinding and adjustment.
The sturdy crankshaft, 2\in. diameter,
runs in four main bearings, and is
balanced statically and dynamically in
addition to being provided with an
impulse neutraliser on the forward end.
Consequently torsional vibration and
“whip” of shaft are absent throughout
the speed range.
A full force-feed lubrication system
is used, oil being supplied under pressure
to connecting-rod, crankshaft, camshaft
bearings and tuning chain, while pressure
from a metered hole in each connecting-
rod bearing effectively lubricates cylinder
walls and valve mechanism. A cartridge-
type oil purifier is located between pump
and bearings. Fuel is held in a 12-gal.
tank swung between rear dumb-irons,
and is drawn by means of a pump oper-
ated by an eccentric from the camshaft
and fed to a down-draught type carburet-
tor.
Carburettor is fitted with hot-spot,
automatic heat control, interconnected
throttle and choke control. Above the
cylinder block and attached to the intake
is an air-cleaner and silencer of generous
size. Water is circulated through the
cooling system by means of an impeller
pump, driven together with generator
and fan by a rubber belt. A thermostatic
heat-control unit is located in the header
pipe between radiator and cylinder block.
Transmission is through single-plate dry-
disc clutch, lOin. diameter, to three-
speed-and-reverse gearbox in unit with
Controlled no-draft ventilation on for-
ward windows. Front and rear sections
may be operated independently or the
complete window lowered as a unit.
crankcase. Free-wheeling gear is built
in, and, together with automatic clutch
equipment, is controlled by cable from
the dashboard. In order to resist wear
in the withdrawal mechanism when the
automatic clutch is in use, a large-section
Oilite bushing is fitted in the clutch pilot.
With the Chrysler automatic clutch the
car can be started up and driven through
any gear without having recourse to the
clutch pedal. The device is located on
the left side of the engine, adjacent to
the clutch housing, and the clutch move-
ment is governed entirely by engine suc-
tion, the speed of engagement being con-
trolled by a pendulum-operated “inertia”
valve. All gears, including reverse, are
of the helical-cut, constant-mesh, “silent”
type, and final drive is through an open
propeller shaft having metal universal
joints with needle bearings fore and aft.
Rear housing is banjo type, all bearings
of axle and wheels being taper-roller
type. Final gear reduction is 4.11 to 1.
Chassis is modern double-drop rigid
bridge type, X-girder truss, giving a
wheelbase of 11 Sin. Rear springs,
long, are conventional semi-elliptic, with
Oilite inserts between leaves and silent U
threaded shackles, while independent sus-
pension is fitted to front wheels. Here
the usual straight-through axle is elimi-
nated, and each front wheel is provided
with a separate mounting and suspension
gear, so allowing it to move indepen-
dently of the other.
Lockheed hydraulic brakes are fitted to
all four wheels, and are actuated by foot
pedal. Hand brake is attached to the
transmission shaft immediately behind
the gearbox. Steering is cross-system
worm-and-roller type, gearbox being
positioned almost directly above the
radius-rod, so eliminating vibration and
road shock.
Bodywork is excellently finished, both
externally and internally. Controlled
draught-free ventilation is fitted to front

that steering arms are mounted individu-
ally in a similar manner to the wheels,
thus eliminating steering troubles.
and rear windows in closed models.
The instrument panel is neatly arranged,
and its fittings include ashtrays, glovebox,
cigar-lighter, double windshield-wiper
control and duplex cowl ventilator.
The car tested weighed, together with
two passengers, 37icwt., speedometer
reading standing at 7957 miles ; motor
and transmission details had therefore
been well “run in” and were quite free and
smooth. Splendid top-gear acceleration,
together with finger-light steering, enabled
congested traffic in the city to be negoti-
ated without effort, and on leaving
Parramatta and passing along the open
country through Baulkham Hills the
speedometer was kept around the 45
mark with merely a taste of throttle.
With the free-wheeling unit in operation
the car coasted freely on down-grades
at similar speed.
Approaching Windsor the rolling test
was conducted. Commencing from a
steady speed of 15 m.p.h., the Chrysler
rolled 726 yards before coming to rest,
proving freedom and perfect alignment of
all running gear and transmission mech-
anism.
Approaching Richmond, on level con-
crete, a test of maximum speed over a
measured mile was made, the distance,
with flying start, being clocked in 46 2-5
sec., averaging 77.6 m.p.h. Over this
section the car
held the road
splendidly, and
there was a
gratifying
absence of
noise, vibration
or fuss. Through

appro aching
Kurrajong
Heights, the by-
pass “dirt” road
through Grose
Vale was taken,
and although
the surface was
extremely rough
in places the
i n d e p endent
front-wheel sus-
pension ab-
sorbed all road
shocks, the car steering as truly and
easily as on level concrete.
The speed climb of Kurrajong Moun-
tain, over a distance of 2 1-5 miles, was
then made, the time occupied being 3min.
18sec., second and top gears being used
throughout. Despite the fast time, the
car maintained splendid balance when
cornering, and, due in a great measure
to independent suspension, steered defi-
nitely over the numerous rough sections.
Temperature of cooling water was but
160 deg. Fahr. at the conclusion of the
long climb.
Returning down the mountain, a test
of emergency brakes was made, the car
pulling up smoothly from a speed of
15 m.p.h, Before reaching Richmond
the cross-country road via Castlereagh to
Penrith was taken, and here further per-
formance tests were conducted. First and
possibly most useful of the series was the
dual test of slow running and accelera-
tion, a distance of 350 yards being covered
in top gear, first as slowly as possible,
followed immediately by a similar dis-
tance on full throttle.
Over the slow-running section the auto-
matic clutch was brought into use, the
distance being covered in 6min. lOsec..
averaging 1.9 m.p.h., while the “accel-
erated” section was clocked in 15 4-5
seconds, crossing the finishing line al
55 m.p.h. and averaging 45.5 m.p.h.—
both excellent performances.
Next test involved acceleration in top
and second gears from 10 to 30 m.p.h..
times being 9 2-5 and 5 2-5 seconds
respectively.
From a standing start to 50 m.p.h.
through all gears occupied 14 2-5 seconds,
while in a test of hydraulic braking
equipment the Chrysler came to a stand-
still from 25 m.p.h. in 25ft. 9in.
Steering circle was measured and found
to be 48ft. on both locks, while road
clearance at lowest point of chassis was
B|in.
Fuel consumed for the complete test
of 130 miles was 6 gallons i pint, average
consumption being therefore 21.4 m.p.g.
(39.9 ton miles per gallon), a highly satis-
factory performance taken in con-
junction with an average road speed,
inclusive of all tests, of 35.5 m.p.h.

cornering and a flying mile, to say no-
thing of the Kurrajong Hill climb at
speed, the writer was keenly watchful for
evidence that the driver’s attention was
distracted. There was no distraction.
With steering-column control of tuning
and volume and a sensitive, easily tuned
receiver, the operations of shifting from
station to station or listening become
second nature, and call for no withdrawal
of attention from the details of driving.
A good driver never takes his eyes off
the road when in motion, and to even
an average driver the handling of a
modern car radio is “pie.”
The Bulletin was allowed to make
the first working test of the latest Amal-
gamated Wireless (Australasia) car-radio
equipment, straight from the laboratory
—a six-valve superhet with unique fea-
tures. Class-B audio is employed, the
valve assembly being 6D6, 6A7, 6D6, 75,
76 and 79. Sensitivity is two. micro-volts,
A.W.A.’s latest car-radio receiver under test by
THE BULLETIN.
selectivity 30kc, and audio output 3
watts. Unlike most car radios, the equip-
ment is in five units —the receiver proper,
the remote tuning control on the steer-
ing column, the loudspeaker, the motor
generator for plate supply, etc., and
accessories, including ignition suppressors
and by-pass condensers. Being a separate
unit the speaker may be mounted any-
where required, and the motor generator
completely eliminates rectifier troubles.
It is housed in a cast-iron case, rubber
sprung, and includes a ripple filter. Con-
nections to the receiver are made in
screened cable. The aerial is arranged in
the roof of the car by crossing a single
wire in such a manner that it becomes
virtually a capacity collector.
Starting from The Bulletin office at
7.59 a.m., the receiver was switched on
and tuned to a Sydney B station (not
located in the city). As the G.P.O. was
passed, the chimes of 8 a.m. boomed out.
Occupants of the car were surprised to
hear the broadcasting station ostensibly
reproduce the chimes fully 35 seconds
after the hour, ample proof that a re-
cording was used. Along the road to Ryde
no serious interference from passing trams
or overhead wiring was in evidence with
the receiver tuned to any station. In
close proximity to the aerial of 2CH the
value of the automatic volume control was
apparent. Even at this point relatively
distant stations such as 2BL, 2UE, 2GB,
2UW and 2KY were at
a constant level. Before
Richmond the car was
worked up to speed for
the flying mile, and at
77.6 m.p.h. 2CH re-
mained comfortably aud-
ible above the hum of
the motor and general
thrumming of the car.
No effort was needed
even at this high speed
to tune from station to
station. Ge o g raphical
features began to affect
reception slightly at the
foot of Kurrajong, 2KY
being remarkably strong
here, but absolutely no
directional effect was
noticed in respect to any station.
Kurrajong was vaulted in a high-speed
climb, 2FC remaining outstanding above
the second-gear noise level of the car.
At the top of the hill, all stations were
heard well, and all increased considerably
in strength on the flat while driving along
the Castlereagh-road to Penrith.
Some idea of the sensitivity of the re-
ceiver can be gleaned from the fact that
near Penrith the overtone of a telegraphic
weather report from the Richmond air
station was copied at the higher fre-
quency end of the tuning range. With
such a receiver two or more stations
should be always audible in daylight

between eastern capital cities, and at
night most assuredly the whole run of
main stations, just as with a home re-
ceiver. One cannot imagine the motor-
ist purchasing a modern car and for the
sake of very little extra cost denying
himself the pleasures and practical ad-
vantages of radio news and entertain-
ment. One should not be considered
without the other. The A.W.A. receiver
is shortly to be placed upon the market,
and should have an enthusiastic recep-
tion.

Cars and Cycles in Night Racing.
Though a good deal of money has been
dropped in Australia in the last dozen
years on attempts to popularise dirt-track
racing at night, the sport, with its inter-
national flavor and plenitude of thrills,
has now firmly established itself.
The visit of an English team last year
gave such racing a fillip, and now at the
R.A.S. Ground (Sydney) the English
Test team is endeavoring to take the
speed ashes back to Blighty. So far
the local lads have the better of the deal,
much of their success being due to ex-
perience overseas during the last year or
so, during which time they have ob-
tained some really fast machines and
evolved the special frames and gear so
necessary for high-speed dirt-track riding.
The big money will, however, always
remain in the hands of the select few
who can afford to maintain mechanical
perfection in their racing stables and
stand the cost of
the expensive
doped fuel used
in ultra-high-com-
pression motors.
Now the two-
wheelers have
shown they can
draw the crowds
midget cars have
begun racing
under electric-
light at Olympic
Park (Melb.).
These baby
machines are
built on the lines
of famous Eng-
lish and Con-
tinental speed
cars, and are
piloted by some of Australia’s leading
speedmen. As a rule the motors are
twin- or four-cylinder motor-cycle
engines “hotted up” for the purpose, and
in order to secure the utmost stability
when “broadsiding” on corners the cars
are fitted with special Dunlop tyres of
4.40 in. balloon section.
On the small dirt-track, 515 yards in
circumference, speeds of about 45 m.p.h.
are obtained, the record lap to date
being circled by L. Gough (Vic.); time
24 2-ssec.
Malcolm Campbell Expects to
Better 300 m.p.h.
In 1933, when Malcolm Campbell
established the world’s land-speed record
at the phenomenal rate of 272.11 m.p.h.,
he was reported to have promised five
miles a minute before he was through
with the business of record-breaking. In
the interim, most motorists have for-
gotten that promise, but not Campbell,
who has spent money lavishly on experi-
ments with a redesigned Blue Bird. Both
car and driver are now at Daytona Beach

preparing for a fresh assault on the
record, to be made on February 18.
Campbell, who is wealthy, has travelled
extensively seeking for natural speed-
ways. Several years ago he used a

tive projected areas, “knife-edge” design and streamlined

natural claypan in Central Africa for
establishing the five-mile record at better
than 200 m.p.h. average, and in this
attempt his out-of-pocket expenses, ex-
cluding cost of car, were said to have
exceeded £lO,OOO.
Daytona Beach, the scene of next
month’s attempt, has had its speedway
lengthened by almost two miles by the
removal of a pair of bridge piles The
straightaway course now extends for 10|-
miles, and it is hoped this will be suffi-
cient to enable Campbell’s car to reach
maximum speed, which is estimated at
between 300 and 320 m.p.h. The actual
speed attained will depend in a great
measure upon surface conditions at the
time.
The newly-constructed Blue Bird re-
tains the original 12-cyl. Rolls-Royce
aero engine, developing 2500-h.p., and
the original chassis and gearbox, but
everything else is new. The twin driving
wheels are fitted with specially-con-
structed smooth-tread Dunlop tyres, to-
gether with dual crown wheels and
pinions. Streamlining of the body has
been modified, giving reduced wind re-
sistance and greater inherent stability.
Wheel-brakes have been eliminated, and
decelerating fins, as used in aeroplane
practice, have been substituted.
This last feature makes motoring
history, for never before has a high-
speed car depended solely upon air-re-
sistance to check its pace. In theory
the fins should fulfil their purpose, but
sympathetic motorists the world over will
be waiting anxiously to learn whether the
great driver was able to stop before
crashing into the Halifax River.
Another unique feature of the new
Blue Bird is in the peculiar design of the
radiator, the streamlined fairing in front
of the car being divided, the required
opening being
secured by lever
control from the
cockpit. Wind
tunnel experi-
men t s indicate
that the car will
be 15 m.p.h.
faster with the
front closed, the
catch being that
the motor can
only run for 30
seconds in this
fashion without
boiling. Conse-
quently the only
possible way in
which full bene-
fits of this in-
genious idea can
be secured will
be for the driver
to operate the
control lever
while the car is travelling at almost 300
m.p.h. and steer a straight course at the
same time—an extremely risky business.
The Trouble Lamp.
E.O’N. (Malvern, Vic.).— Although tyres on
the other three wheels of my new car (6000
miles) are scarcely marked, the outer tread
of the offside front wheel is wearing rapidly.
On greasy roads steering appears tender. Cause
and cure ?
Camber of this wheel is excessive. Adjust-
ment can be readily made with distance washers
in the independent wheel suspension.
“Lairt” (Goulburn, N.S.W.). — After six
months’ use I have had my six-cyl. car top
overhauled, and
now the motor will
not run slowly, and
when accelerated in
top gear “kicks”
terribly in the flex-
ible mounting. Pull-
ing is not up to
standard, and the
engine only runs
smoothly after 30
m.p.h. What’s the
trouble ?
Indications are
that one or more of
the valves are riding
on the tappets. If
the motor “pops” in
the carburettor fre-
quently it will be
conclusive evidence.
Only remedy is to
have valve clearances correctly adjusted.
L.B. (Albury, N.S.W.). — What is the shortest
distance within which a car, fitted with four-
wheel brakes, can be stopped from a speed of
30 m.p.h. ?
A number of factors must be known to
arrive at this result; condition of road sur-
face, condition of tyre tread and inflation pres-
sure, loading of car and mechanical efficiency
of brakes all affect the issue. Under ideal
conditions a car should theoretically stop in
30ft. from 30 m.p.h. This theoretical ideal has
been bettered in a number of tests, but in prac-
tice a car pulling up in from 32ft. to 35ft. from
a speed of 30 m.p.h. is in good mechanical
adjustment.
A. (Wollongong, N.S.W.).— Of late the
starting motor of my 1929 Buick has been giving
trouble. Occasionally the engine will start up
readily, but at other times the starter appears
to engage with a dull sound without turning
the engine. If this happens at night the lights
get very dim. Cause and cure ?
More than likely the battery is old and does
not hold charge. Symptoms point to flat bat-
tery, or poor contact of one of the electrical
connections from battery to frame or battery to
starter motor. Always switch off lights at night
before pressing starter pedal; you will get
much better service from the battery even with
new equipment.
B. (Pak Plantations, New Guinea). —
Name of a car that can be converted to heavy-
duty truck work ? Who are suppliers ?
Suggest you advertise, setting out exact speci-
fications. Names and addresses can be sup-
plied when required.
B.S. (Southport, Q.). — After reaching 32
m.p.h. a peculiar vibration is set up in my
\2-h.p. sedan. This causes the bodywork to
drum, and is most annoying; even coasting in
neutral downhill the vibration persists, and in-
creases with speed. What’s the trouble ?
If the vibration does not stop when the
engine is idling, the trouble must be behind
the gearbox. Inspect the fabric universal joints
for cracks, and check alignment of propeller
shaft.
A.M.M. (Balmain, N.S.W.). — My 1-h.p. tourer
has developed a bad wheel-wobble. King-pins
are a good fit, and steering connections were
recently overhauled. Wedges have been placed
under the axle without effecting a cure. Is there
any other remedy ?
Wheel-wobble is a mysterious disorder, and
a suitable remedy for one car might be totally
ineffective in another of identical make. Best
plan is to take the car to one of the large
city service stations equipped with precision
instruments for testing wheel alignments.
H.L.Z. (Brisbane). — Have just had a new
driving pinion fitted to my ’27 Buick, and on
jacking up the rear wheels to check brake adjust-
ment I notice that when either wheel is rotated
the other one turns in the opposite direction.
Is this correct, or has the pinion been wrongly
adjusted ?
Everything is correct. The reverse rotation
is due to the action of the differential gear,
which is so arranged that the outside wheel
can run faster than the inside on corners,
avoiding frictional tyre wear. Let one wheel
rest on the ground, put gear lever in neutral and
turn the free wheel either forward or back
and see what happens!
H.M. (Balwyn, Vic.). — Am interested in your
reference to 11 -h.p. Singer (B. 5/12/’34). When
will a test be made, and, if not for some time,
will you tell me (1) whether it will be a genuine
1935 model ; (2) are engine and transmission
reliable; (3) is the independent springing a
success, or is it prone to make the car tip over
on corners ?
Test not possible for at least two months.
(1) Yes, 1935 series. (2) Judging from draw-
ings and specifications, the new machine should
be robust and reliable. (3) Independent front-
wheel suspension has been proved under Aus-
tralian conditions to be a great advantage and
extremely steady on rough corners.
J-D. (Cootamundra, .N.S.W.). — Am consider-
ing fitting a supercharger to my 15.9-h.p.
Lancia. (1) Is the car suitable for supercharg-
ing ? (2) Approx, effect on speed, pulling and
petrol consumption ? (3) Cost of fitting, and
where obtainable ?
(1) Not without considerable experiment in
valve-timing and intake-manifold design. (2)
If properly installed and suitable alterations
made, maximum speed may increase by five
to 10 m.p.h. Pulling and acceleration should
be improved, .with about the same petrol con-
sumption as at present. (3) Supercharger would
have to be imported, and cost, fitted, would
be £4O/£5O. Strongly advise against the ex-
periment, which may entail more trouble than
it is worth.
MOTOR ODDITIES.
Motorists are invited to write to “The Bulletin” and
recount any interesting or novel experiences; these,
where accepted, will be published under “Motor
Oddities.”
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not
been confined to racing and competition drivers, while
outback mechanics, with typical Australian ingenuity,
have worked miracles in getting their cars home.
Descriptions of ancient motors still in service; drivers
with huge mileages to their credit, and details of diffi-
cult and hazardous journeys are among subjects of
interest to readers of “The Steering Column.”
Motor Oddities.
“Nemo”: A familiar sight in Bunda-
berg (Q.) is W. Parry in his one-cylinder
De Dion. The car was bought in
April, 1905, minus tyres, lamps and
hood, for £305. It has now done 130,000
miles.
* * * *
“Awbeca”: During a trip from Too-
woomba to Gympie (Q.), while many
miles from any township and in rough,
hilly country, the low gear of my car
broke. I had already crossed one spur of
the Blackall Range, and there was another
ahead of me. The grade was too steep
for second-gear work, so I perforce ran
back to the bottom of the hill. Then I
decided to attack the hill backwards, so
started up in reverse gear. On one side
was a rocky bank, on the other a drop
of some hundred feet. I steered close to
the bank and hoped for the best, I did
this over three long pulls—each of them
well over a mile in length and round
hairpin bends into the bargain. During
one ascent 1 heard the toot of a horn of
a descending car. I couldn’t get out of
the way and I couldn’t stop, so I just
kept on and let the other fellow look out
for himself. Fortunately he realised my
predicament and gave me as wide a
berth as space permitted—and a look of
vast astonishment.

HIGH-FIDELITY AMPLIFICATION.
By DON B. KNOCK.
The finest possible degree of audio amplification, or sound reproduction
that can be attained should merit the application of the term “high
fidelity.” Unfortunately, “high fidelity” has become a trade slogan of
rather indiscriminate use. Details of measures taken to ensure accurate
reproduction given by the chief engineer of an American transformer co.
to “Radio” ( U.S.A .) give some insight into the nature of the problem and
the most modern methods of approaching its solution.
Great improvements have been effected
in the last few years in the overall accu-
racy of audio amplification systems.
During a recent demonstration of labora-
tory equipment people were pleasantly
but few realised at the time that
reproduction of a similar nature can be
obtained commercially, and is not con-
fined to the laboratory. In the test men-
Figure 1.
tioned an actual frequency range of 35
to 16,000 cycles was obtained, but for
what passes as “high fidelity” it has been
found that a frequency range of 60 to
8000 cycles will serve.
Factors Controlling Fidelity.
Frequency discrimination in audio am-
plification is almost entirely controlled by
the audio transformers used. Years of re-
search in this field have resulted in the
development of transformers of extremely
Figure 2.
wide frequency range. The commercial
production of such transformers re-
quires specialised equipment and rigid
inspection. Harmonic content is pri-
marily a function of the valves used and
their operation. When properly used a
valve is a linear device, and at the point
of linearity deviation harmonics are in-
troduced. Thus the use of proper valves
is necessary to meet high-fidelity re-
quirements. They must be correctly
operated, so that not over 5 p.c. har-
monic distortion is present at the highest
power output normally required. Addi-
tionally, care must be taken in the de-
sign of audio transformers, particularly
those operating at high level, so that
they will operate over an essentially
linear portion of the core material mag-
netisation curve.
Amplifier Design Details.
Fig. 2 illustrates, with the pre-ampli-
fier of Fig. 1, a complete circuit diagram
of a high-fidelity amplifier suitable for
raising the input level of a crystal, con-
denser, dynamic or carbon microphone
to an output level of 100 watts at 5 p.c.
distortion. This amplifier employs stan-
dard valves and Class-A prime amplifi-
cation in the output. It is comparatively
economical in operation, and has an
overall gain of approximately 120 d.b.
It is desirable in high-gain amplifier
equipment to isolate the low- and high-
level stages. This, in adition to reduc-
ing hum and feedback tendencies, allows
the control of gain at a level higher than
that of the original source. The main
amplifier obtains a full 100 watts from
the 845 type valves.* Due to its excel-
lent fidelity and low-harmonic content,
the 845 is a popular valve in U.S.A. for
theatre and public-address work, where
a power output of 30 to 50 watts is re-
quired. Few people realise that, pro-
perly used in push-pull, a pair of these
valves can deliver 100 watts with only
5 p.c. distortion, with 1250 plate volts
and 225 to 260 volts bias. The efficiency
depends upon the fact that, while high
second harmonics are developed, the
push-pull connection tends to cancel
them out. R.G.A. (U.S.A.) uses these
valves in the audio-output section of its
new high-fidelity low-powered trans-
mitters.
Circuit Details.
The simplicity of the circuit illustrated
is apparent. Push-pull transformer-
coupled stages are used throughout.
There is at tendency to balance out plate
hum, and the necessity for parallel feed-
ing audio transformers is eliminated. The
59 valves have sufficient power to drive
the 845’s to maximum output with negli-
gible distortion from the 59’s.
The loading resistors in shunt with the
845 input transformer secondary tend to
stabilise the load reflected to the triode-
connected 59’s. A separate power supply
provides bias for the output valves, and
the two 500-ohm potentiometers are ad-
justed so that plate currents can be per-
fectly balanced. The filters for both
plate and bias supply of the main am-
plifier are tuned filters with very high
efficiency, and the output transformer
has ideal universal impedances for pub-
lic-address use —1.2, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20,
30, 50, 125, 200, 250, 333 and 500 ohms.
The important factors in this high-
fidelity amplifier are:
{a) High gain—l2o d.b. suitable for all
P.A. work.
{b) Low distortion —less than 5 p.c.
. at all levels below normal maximum
output.
(c) True Class-A prime operation in
output stage.
id) High power output, 100 watts.
(, e ) Plate supply with good regulation.
(/) Low hum level.
( g ) Simplicity of construction.
( h ) Economical operation.
This amplifier will faithfully transmit
all frequencies from 40 to 10,000 cycles.

RING-A-RING-A-WAGNER.
The high esteem in which Germans
hold Scandinavian and Icelandic myth-
ology and their claim (anthropologically
unsustainable so far as southern Ger-
many is concerned) to be the racial
descendants of denizens of Nordic climes
are matters which we British have diffi-
culty in understanding. There can be
no doubt, however, that the legends in-
corporated by Wagner in his “Ring” are
inextricably associated with German
nationalism, and that patriotism as well
as musical appreciation has contributed
to the success of the composer’s works.
As far as the Sydney programme of the
Fuller opera co. has been outlined, only
one section of the “Ring,” “The Val-
kyrie,” has been given a place, but there
is a suggestion that others may be per-
formed if conditions are propitious, and
a sketch of the framework over which
the four operas are strung may be of
assistance to those who attend the per-
formances or listen to broadcasts.
As in most of his other operas, Wag-
ner has, in this quartet, expressed his
faith that mankind must look to Woman
for regeneration and salvation, particu-
larly in the direction of being freed from
the twin curses (as he considered them)
of greed of wealth and lust for power.
But the effects of mythological traditions
are often divorced from the moralities,
and Germany probably owes 1918 as
much to Siegfried’s sword and helmet as
to Nietzsche’s amoral philosophy. Bu ;
to get on with the story.
“The Rhinegold”: In his subter-
ranean kingdom Alberich (Nordic for
Pluto), king of the gnomes, or nibelungs,
held sway by reason of the power con-
ferred by possession of the Ring and the
Tarnhelm (helmet) forged from gold
stolen from the Rhinedaughters. He
might have gone on gnoming away quite
happily for centuries if Fricka (Nordic
for Juno), queen of Wotan (Nordic for
Jove), king of the gods, had not badgered
her one-eyed, venerable but very flighty
husband into building a magnificent
castle, Valhalla (Nordic for Olympus),
remarking that something in the nature
of a home was necessary if she was ever
to see him in it. The contract was let
to the firm of Fafner and Fasolt, giants,
and the price mentioned in the agreement
v/as Freia (Nordic for Venus). When
it came to stumping up Wotan jibbed.
Instead, he went along to poor little
Alberich, induced the silly little mutt to
change himself into a frog by magic of
the Tarnhelm, put his foot on him and
stole all his treasures (Nordic version of
a Puss-in-Boots incident). These, to-
gether with the Ring and the Tarnhelm,
he turned over to the building contrac-
tors. Alberich had imbued the Ring with
a blighting and deadly Curse, and this
started to work at once. The giants quar-
relled, Fafner slew Fasolt, changed him-
self into a dragon, and went to live in
a cave in a forest to guard the partner-
ship assets, now his sole property. So
far the pure influence of Woman, as
represented by Fricka, seems to have
caused nothing but trouble ; but let us
press on.
“The Valkyrie”: Wotan, getting very
windy about the Curse, went into confer-
ence with Erda (Nordic for Minerva),
who advised him it couldn’t be lifted
save by the unselfish restoration to the
Rhinedaughters of their stolen property.
No god or goddess could do the job, as
the deities had a vested interest in the
curse-lifting. A by-product of the con-
ference was the establishment of the Val-
kyries Battalion for the defence of Val-
halla. Whether these stalwart maidens
were goddesses or human is a moot
point, but they rode all over heaven on
horses. Having attended to domestic
defence, Wotan descended to earth as
Walse (an old trick of his) and begot the
Walsung twins Siegmund and Sieglinde.
His notion was that they should marry
and beget a human hero who would lift
the Curse. Interesting this. First gen-
eration, offspring of god and human, are
not human. Their offspring are human.
To make Siegmund and Sieglinde truly
heroic Nordics, Wotan gives them pecks
of trouble. Sieglinde becomes wife of
the robber Hunding, a basso of the deep-
est dye. Siegmund, taking refuge in
Hunding’s hut, ‘first discovers a Sword,
forged for him by Wotan, and then runs
away with his sister Sieglinde. Fricka,
interfering again, insists that Hunding
shall be allowed to take vengeance on
Siegmund, and the Valkyrie Brunnhildc
is sent to see that he does. But she
weakens, and Wotan has to intervene
himself, breaking Siegmund’s sword, so
that Handing slays him. Brunnhilde as
punishment, is cast into a deep sleep
(Nordic version of “Sleeping Beauty )
and surrounded by a barrier ol: fire. The
hero who wakes her shall have her as
bride.
“Siegfried”: Siegfried is the illegiti-
mate son of Siegmund and Sieglinde. He
was reared by Mime, a nibelung, who
proposes to use him as a cat’s-paw for
the overthrow of Fafner. Mime tries to
weld the broken Sword ; fails. Siegfried
tries; succeeds; goes forth and slays
Fafner with the Sword. Having acci-
dentally tasted Fafner’s blood, he under-
stands what, the birds say, and a little

bird tells him (a Saxon legend here) that
Mime is a twister. So he kills Mime, and
goes out into the wide world to discover
and rescue and marry Brunnhilde. But
not to live happily ever afterwards. As
a matter of fact, Wotan sees such an
awful lot of trouble coming that he de-
cides to go out of the deity business.
“Twilight of the Gods”: Siegfried,
going forth for adventures, gets mixed
up with Gunther and his sister Gutrune
and a low nibelung named Hagen. As
a result of their plotting he forgets he
ever met Brunnhilde, and hands her ovei
to Gunther. Brunnhilde, furious, con-
spires with Gunther and Hagen, and
Hagen slaughters Siegfried and then
assassinates Gunther. Brunnhilde, learn-
ing too late that Siegfried wasn’t to
blame, though appearances were against
him, takes the Ring from his dead finger,
mounts her war-horse and plunges into
a wall of flame. The Rhine rises m
flood, the Rhinedaughters recover their
Ring, and Valhalla, having inexplicably
caught fire, goes up in smoke. The Curse
is lifted, the gods are dead, and it’s all
due to Brunnhilde. According to an
earlier stage of the legend, the offspring
of gods couldn’t lift the Curse, or even
a half-breed, but no matter. The series
had to end sometime.
Wagner, in seeking to establish that
Woman is the world-saver, has not
avoided the Old Testament implication
that she is the principal reason why the
world needs saving. If the Rhinedaugh-
ters in their pride and vanity hadn’t made
a Ring; if Fricka hadn’t insisted on
building Valhalla and on having Sieg-
mund killed ; if Gutrune hadn’t doped
Siegfried, and if Brunnhilde hadn’t con-
nived at murder through jealousy—well,
there wouldn’t have been any Ring.

This Interference.
Many signals have skipped o’er this
whirling ball of clay (and other minerals
that make poor earths) since first I poked
an explanatory ear and fist into wireless.
Fresh from onslaughts in the senior
grades of a Bananaland academy upon
the theories of Ohm of revered memory,
I soon learned to catalogue the racket
that attends listening upon valve sets, in-
struments which, despite the delusions of
certain after-dinner speakers, have long
since emerged from their infancy. Now
that sets are daily growing more sensi-
tive, the din in the “cans” defeats de-
scription at times. But man-made mush
gallops in ahead of the rest of the field.
His jockey is Buzz, B-u-z-z, begotten of
commutator brushes.
Should I, aggravated to the limit of
reason, decide to hie me to the cool
edges of the Pacific to forget the din in
the family broadcatcher and the thrice-
stoked hell of the shorter waves, I must
ensure that the exhaust of my vehicle
offendeth not the after-dinner somno-
lence of the plebs. And I, in my speedy
passing, am soon forgotten, though none
the less catholically anathematised. Let
a locomotive, whilst marshalling a train,
greet the dawn as hilariously and chim-
ingly as the barnyard male, and Authority
admonisheth. All very proper and per-
tinent.
Let me paint thickly. Circumstances
recently marooned me in one of the
larger country towns of this State. A
multi-cylindered Diesel puffed a noxious
cloud at the moon, which glittered hand-
somely upon the exterior appurtenances
of a powerhouse. I entered, solo, to ob-
serve the child of the magician in charge
idolising the fire-ring which threatened
to engulf the suffering commutators.
Fireworshipping with him stood two
attractive females. I edged into the
gathering, feeling like a lad in an aviary
without his shanghai. A couple of hun-
dred adult amperes were making this
machine their tarmac. I gathered, over
the flog of belting, that “she was a bit
mica-high.” She was! Truly a high-
stepper !
Down the street Giuseppe’s refrigera-
tor occupied a deal of shop-space.
“ Man-made mush gallops in ahead of the
field. His jockey is Buzz, B-u-z-z.”
Across the way his rival Xerxes had an
opposition model going on “Very Cold.”
No suppressing-gear annihilated the fire-
works at either installation.
The morality of the thing surprises and
saddens me. If I use my motor-mangle
or the hundred-odd pounds’ worth of
a “ham” transmitter which I have
assembled since lang syne, I must avoid
creating a nuisance to either the war-
shattered Digger or the at the
corner with her 15s. receiver. Quite
right, and I heartily endorse. Should I
park my peanut-shells upon the floor of
the Stadium what time I grow excited
Authority gives a very peremptory shush-
shush. Quite right again.
Fm an old hand at radio. As one of
the original team which organised the
Wireless Institute of Australia, I early
pointed out the interference that was
bound to grow as the users of rotating
machinery increased, more particularly
since myopic local authorities have an
inexplicable affection for direct-current
machines. (To be a good shire or town

channel micro-ray aviation radio service.
councillor you must be born and bred
there, own half the village and be as
narrow in outlook as the blade of the
razor that you use bi-weekly.)
At the country town aforementioned
I heard receivers drowned in mush. I met
people who had cancelled their licenses
in disgust. In the city I have related my
grievances to the City Council, to be told
that I did not know what I was talking
of ; that the mains were as Cassar’s wife.
Yet, in Bennett’s-road, Brisbane, I have
seen coronae upon the high-tension lines
on a dewy night. I was finally referred
to the radio branch of the G.P.O., to be
there advised that representations—repre-
sentations, mark ye!—had already been
made about the high- and low-pressure
mains. However, a Government that
fails to insist upon provision of radio
on all seagoing vessels, whether inter-
or intra-State, cannot be expected to fore-
see the need for interference elimination,
not merely reduction. The recent Royal
Commission on electricity charges was
advised that suppression is a matter of
Federal law. Federal law says that
States are autonomous. That leaves no-
body to carry a baby to whom there’s
nobody to offer a dummy, or, better
still, a whiff of chloroform. The latter
remedy would, in most cases, consist of
a pair of 4mf. condensers, a yard of
wire and a mother-in-law peck with a
soldering iron, at a capital cost, in gross
lots, of far less than 10s. Condenser fac-
tories could do with the work.
Meanwhile more brush machines are
revving-up each day, more buzz and
blasphemy bounces from the homes of
radio-set owners and more people keep
on keeping on. To my way of thinking
suppressors should be as compulsory a
fitting, at least on rotating machines, as
are fuses, earths and other provisions of
the fire underwriters.
High-gain receivers are “out” at my
QRA. I recall at this stage that next
month the P.M.G. will request me to
change 30s. into a slip of paper. I will
do it willingly. My relations with that
gentleman have always been of the sweet-
est, and I wish to retain his good favor.
One of these days the Alsatian of Fed-
eral law will hop the boundary-fence and
kill the poodle of State law, and I for
one will bury the corpse, unwept, un-
honored and unsung.

Country Short-wave Explorations.
Generally various special programmes
are sent out from the U.S.A. on New
Year’s Day, but although many weak
carriers were heard conditions were so
poor that no station was of entertain-
ment value. The best was probably the
Manila station, about 34 metres.
Morning conditions have continued
poor. There has been an improvement
in DJC (49.83), but 2RO (30.7) has been
weaker. We may have to wait until
autumn to find any real improvement
after seven in the morning.
RNE has been again very good during
the 9 p.m. Sunday session, and proposes
in future to start at 8 p.m., with an extra
session on Wednesday at the same hour.
It is doubtful if this will be an improve-
ment for us, as
audibility is best
towards 10 p.m.
WSXK’s evening
session on 19
metres has almost
faded out. The
American amateurs
in the 20-metre
band have been
coming in well
after midnight, and
continue for some
hours, but the 40-
metre band, usu-
ally so full of life
on Sundays, has
been very poor,
with skip, fading
and high noise
level on most
signals.
Conditions have
been very erratic
lately, signal
strength varying
from exceptionally
good to very poor.
The early-evening
sessions from both
the 8.8. C. and
German stations
were very good
early in the week
for about an hour
after commencing,
when signal
strength dropped
quickly to a point
below any recep-
tion value.
3LR was also irregular, being at maxi-
mum one night and inaudible the next.
Early in the month the 20-metre band
was exceptional. On the 2nd amateurs
were heard from all over Europe as early
as 9 p.m., but by the end of the week the
band was dead. On the 3rd there was
a very fine transmission from PHI of the
opera “Rigoletto.” This was a pleasure
to listen to, with no sign of static or
fading at any time.
One morning was good for the 25-
metre band, and WBXK was strong at
7 a.m., with 2RO and FYA fair. A
cool southerly came up in the middle of
the week, and, as always happens in that
case, all stations fell away at once.
One late night was tried, and it was
found that GSA, in the 49-metre band,
is now quite good in the
small hours of the morn-
ing, 7LO and DJC being
only fair, and both the
Russians weak.
Outside short-wave re-
ception a feature of in-
terest has been the
appearance of IYA
(Maoriland) at great
strength about 6.30 p.m.
No M.L. stations have
ever been heard here
before in the summer at
this hour. Apparently
the new transmitter has
been put into operation,
and with the increase in
power of the Japanese
stations the winter will
provide some problems
in selectivity.
A ’phone station, has been operating
for some time right in the middle of the
25-metre broadcast band. This sounds
like a Japanese, and has been heard as
early as 8 p.m. Such transgressors should
be dealt with under the arrangement be-
tween all nations to keep certain bands
free for broadcasting only.
NIGHTOWL.
Superhets and Tuned R.F.
“Jyk,” radio dealer of Sarina (N.Q.),
adds to his observations (B. 12/12/’34):
“The object of my letter was misinter-'
preted. You say I consider T.R.F. re-
ceivers aren’t suitable for some districts.
‘Experienced Reader,’ of Cairns (B.
14/10/’34), said: ‘Superhets may offer
advantages of selectivity when used in
a mild climate, but up here humidity
keeps them constantly in trouble.’ I
wished to point out that this is incorrect.
Any new model superhet of reliable
make has its parts impregnated. Earlier
1933 models were not impregnated and
did give trouble. The superhet, so far
as it has progressed to-day, is more reli-
able than the old T.R.F. Certainly
Ferrocart coils and impregnation may
tell a different story in results, but we
must wait and see. A person next door
to one six-valve superhet here owned a
six-valve T.R.F. made by the same con-
cern and in perfect order. Frequently
he had to close down, as static rendered
reception out of the question. The
superhet still gave comfortable and en-
joyable results. One leading manufac-
turer is now making a superhet almost
totally devoid of background noise.”
[Continual improvement in valves has
resulted recently in marked development
in the reduction of noise level in fre-
quency conversion in superhets. As the
tuned R.F. receiver, by virtue of its
principle, should in theory be inherently
less susceptible to “mush,” there appears
to be no reason why a satisfactory
modern type using particularly suitable
valves and coils should not be developed.
The noisy T.R.F. set referred to by
“Jyk” is an extreme case, and it may
be doubted that the set was in perfect
order and not working under any handi-
cap. N.Q. readers who favor T.R.F. may
wish to comment. — Ed.]
What’s What in Radio.
One of Hitler’s propaganda moves was
to have the German radio manufacturers
turn out a low-cost “people’s receiver”
purely for local-station reception. Figures
now show that in six months a quarter
of a million of these sets were sold. Nor-
way is now considering whether the in-
troduction of such a set would not be
similarly beneficial.

An expression of gratitude was for-
warded from the British Navy to a 73-
year-old Canadian doctor who operates
an amateur station in British territory in
China. Dr. Malcolm’s station, AC3MA,
sent word to the British Legation of the
S.S. Shuntien piracy in the Yellow River
before news could travel by any other
method, and he handled a considerable
number of messages to and from the
British fleet in Chinese waters.

It is possible that, with the advent of
the “acorn”-type valves, midget pocket
radio receivers will appear. Such a re-
ceiver could be made no larger than a
pocket camera and with a self-contained
earphone. It would be useful for recep-
tion of news reports, speeches and special
broadcasts. The only snag is in the
weight of the batteries, but special dry
cells could be made almost as small as
cigarettes, and, if the necessary voltage
is available, it matters little if the opera-
tion is only for a short period. Many
people would find plenty of use for such
a receiver always at hand.

In 1909, when Scott left England for
the Antarctic, eight accumulators went
with him. Eventually they were returned
to England by another expedition, and
were stowed away and forgotten about
during the war. Somebody trickier
charged them and used them for radio
for a while, and then left them idle for
six months. In the end they were taken
to the makers by somebody with a know-
ledge of their 25 years of adventure, and
when tested the cells were well above
the nominal ampere-hour capacity.

turned out a product named Celenamel.
Special machinery has been installed for
applying the cellophane to the wire.
Adhesive is first applied and the material
wrapped in place, the finished wire being
lacquered and baked. It is claimed that
wire so treated is a space-saver, has in-
creased dielectric strength, and costs ap-

A system of gain control by valve in
place of resistor has been developed in
U.S.A. In this device, type 79 or 53
valves are used as a variable impedance,
the value of which remains constant for
any variation of input. As the gain is
varied, the impedance characteristics do
not vary.
Casual Comment.
“Old Ham”: In hearing the signals
from Kingsford Smith’s Southern Cross
in mid-air across the Pacific in 1928 com-
mercial concerns didn’t have it on their
own. Amateurs were well in the picture.
Before me is a copy of a radio monthly,
now defunct, technical editor of which
was The Bulletin’s present radio editor
“D.8.K.” Date is June 15, 1928. “As
we write this, on Monday night, June 4,
1928, we are listening to the laconic mes-
sages from KHAB, the aeroplane* South-
ern Cross, piloted by Captain Kingsford
Smith. The loudspeaker is delivering
these messages with ample punch, and
makes the use of headphones superflu-
ous. At intervals the 1000-cycle note
from the air-driven generator splutters
forth, and, as the operator says ‘the air is
not so good,’ it is easy to visualise the
machine nosing her way into air currents.
It is easy to note the variations in the
transmission with altering generator
speed.”
[On this memorable occasion KHAB’s
signals were picked up and copied in
Randwick (N.S.W.) shortly after the
plane left Oakland. The receiver used
was the first of its kind, employing a
screen-grid valve as T.R.F. amplifier for
short waves. Reception conditions across
the Pacific were particularly favorable
at this period, and during each hop until
the Southern Cross reached the Austra-
lian coast at Ballina (N.S.W.) little diffi-
culty was encountered, with the exception
of “skip” periods, in copying operator
Warner’s excellent “fist.” — Ed.]

An article in an English radio journal
says that “a careful comparison of com-
mercial field strengths and amateur activ-
ity reveals a sad lack of keenness in some
parts of our Empire.” The writer claims
that a contest of some kind is necessary
tfi bring along the enthusiasm to work
as many stations as possible. The trouble
i$ that “when it’s night-time in Italy
it’s Sunday over here.” In other words,
somebody must get up early at one of the
ends for contact between Europe and
Australia on 7mc., and even keen ama-
teurs like that extra half-hour in the
morning!
* * *
“Enno”: The view is often expressed
that the experimental transmitter in Aus-
tralia is increasing in numbers. This
may be so, but there are a lot of can-
cellation of licenses. I ant often sur-
prised to see notice of cancellation of a
license the callsign of which has been
active night after night with hardly a
break for 12 months or so. There are
many amateurs who appear and, with a
meteoric flourish, go flat out on DX,
lose hours of sleep (and, perhaps, years
of life) in getting a W.A.C. (Worked All
Continents) certificate from 1.A.R.U., and
then throw in the towel. During the
breathless career of such temporary DX
merchants the amateur with a serious
interest in his work suffers from a surfeit
of QRM. If the QSL card was abolished
there would be less incentive to dabblers
to clutter up the air.

“Enno”: That scheme of two Mbree
boys to deal with the ’hopper plague by
driving a copper screen between two cars,
insulated and charged from a spark-coil,
is worthy of further development. One
has only to note the effect on any insect,
large or small, foolish enough to walk
across the turns of the plate-tank circuit
of a 50-watt high-frequency oscillator.
Just a fizzle, and little or no insect re-
mains. Farmers could erect lengthy
screens stretching across the whole length
of a wheat crop on posts, and by con-
certed action drive the ’hoppers into it.
Many might fly over the screen, but if
it is made high enough most wouldn’t.

In the 8.8. C. broadcast arrangements
for the recent royal wedding moving-
coil microphones were installed at eight
points in Westminster Abbey. The con-
trol was located in Henry Vll.’s chapel,
and engineers were conducting exhaus-
tive tests for a week before the ceremony.
The biggest problem was to avoid
interaction between microphones and
loudspeakers. That they were emi-
nently successful in this was shown
by the excellence of the broadcast
from a technical viewpoint. One
could almost sense the prayers of the
engineer at the control point. With the
whole British Empire depending upon
his faders and gadgets, a mere splutter
in an amplifier would be enough to give
him the “dithers.” Well done, 8.8. C.!

Many prominent members of the radio
trade take more than a passing interest
in short-wave radio. After manufactur-
ing receivers for a while the doings of the
amateurs become interesting to them, and
the professional turns amateur for relaxa-
tion. Norman Gilmour, of Lekmek
Radio Laboratories, holds an experimen-
tal license; so does Pat Manley, head of
Amplion (A’sia), Ltd. The newest trade
recruit to amateur transmitting ranks is
Noel Morse, son of “Pop” Morse, of
Wholesale Radio, Rowe-street, Sydney.
Noel is the head of the well-known
Creela Company, of power-transformer
fame. His newly-constructed short-wave
station is a model of well-engineered
frames and polished surfaces.

Mullard Radio Co. (Aust.), Ltd., has
issued a comprehensive data book on
the new Mullard range of 4-volt A.C.
valves. These include the FC4 octode
frequency-changer, V.P.4 variable MU
R.F. Pentode, SP4 “Straight” R.F. pen-
tode, TDD 4 duo-diode-triode, Pen 4VA
indirectly-heated power pentode and IW 3
indirectly-heated, full-wave rectifier. The
advantage of the last-named is that it
overcomes the difficulties of overloading
filter and by-pass condensers where an
indirectly-heated valve is used in the last
stage of a receiver. The time lag intro-
duced by the indirectly-heated rectifier
is such that the load current and recti-
fier output voltage tend to increase
simultaneously. All these valves are sup-
plied in standard American bases, and
manufacturers should not be slow to
include the obvious advantages of these
new products in modern receiver design.
* * * *
The amateur transmitter has a definite
need for filter condensers capable of
standing up to his modest requirements
at an equally modest cost. Most of the
high-voltage condensers on the market in
Australia are beyond the pocket of the
average experimenter. Ducon Condenser
Pty., 73 Bourke-street, Waterloo, N.S.W.,
has come to the rescue with the type
illustrated. This is a 4 mfd. condenser
rated at 750 working volts, and the price
is only 245. In addition to its utility in
transmitter power-supply systems, it is
also invaluable for power amplifiers and
public-address systems where D.C. volt-
ages higher than those within the peak
rating of electrolytic condensers are
applied.

The following letter, received by the
manufacturers of Tasma radio, speaks for
itself: “I am delighted with the Tasma
Model 190, and 1 consider it the best
reproducing set. I have heard hundreds
of different makes, but Tasma beats them
all. Here in Urana, 400 miles south of
Sydney and 200 miles east of Melbourne,
this set picks up all Victorian, N. S.
Wales, South Australian and Queensland
stations with plenty of punch' with volume
control half on and only 50ft. aerial,
25ft. high. Static hardly noticeable. Of
course, the above is daylight reception ;
night reception jumps 100 per cent. —
M.L., Tasmania, etc.”
The Q. and A. Column.
/ understand there are various types of vari-
able condensers and that some have the effect
of crowding stations on the dial. What are
the differences and advantages ? —215.
The illustrations show the designs of the
plates in the different types of variable con-
densers. With the straight-line capacity type
equal movements of the dial give equal varia-
tions in capacity. This was no disadvantage in
the days when broadcasting stations were few
and far between. With the increase in the
number of stations the straight-line frequency
condenser with plates as shown was introduced.
Moving the dial one degree would change the
frequency, say, 20 kilocycles, and so on. Fre-
quency being a stumbling-block for the lay
mind, the straight-line wave-length condenser
next appeared. This provides equal wave-length
change for equal dial movement. Finally, the
log. mid-line type was introduced, and this is
between the straight-line frequency and straight-
line wave-length types.
/ am building the Wide-World Two, with
alterations. (1) Why were the 63-volt valves
used ? Could I replace the 77 and 38 with
57 and 2A5 ? (2) Would a 25-mfd. electrolytic
be better than a 10 -mfd. for a 2A5 bias resistor
by-pass ? (3) Would a 5-to-l-ratio audio
transformer be suitable for the audio coupling
in the suggested circuit for extra amplification ?
(4) Could a dynamic speaker be used with 57,
56 and 2A5 ? If so, what type ? (5) How could
headphones be employed ? (6) Will you please
supply chassis layout and dimensions ? —217.
(1) The 6.3-volt valves are less prone to
tunable hum problems, and appear to be slightly
more efficient than the 2.5-volt types. (2) Prob-
ably, although 10 mfd. seems ample. (3) Yes,
but this must be adequately decoupled. (4)

One method of doing this is illustrated in
the diagrams shown here, from “Short-wave
Craft” (U.S.A.). The resistors in the feeders
may be anything between 200 and 1000 ohms,
but they should be non-inductive. All other
values are referred to in the diagrams.


THE OTHER
FELLOW'S
MIND.
Roman Holiday
The death of two motorists in a road-
race at Phillip Island (Vic.) raises the
question whether such races are of any
value.
There is every reason to encourage
speed work on a properly-prepared
track which offers the same advan-
tages, the same handicaps, to each car
engaged; a track, standardised in shape,
in banks, in surface. Given a capable
driver, there are no race tactics or un-
known hazards to affect the result.
If Car A does 100 m.p.h. it is a faster
car than Car B, which can turn off only
95 m.p.h. If Car C covers 50 m.p.g. it is
a less expensive car to run than Car D,
which does only 45 m.p.g. Shortcomings
can be corrected in the next model.
The dashes at records of every sort —not
only speed and petrol consumption, but
starting, braking and everything else con-
nected with car-driving—have all had
their value, and will have increased value
in the future.
But motor races over an ordinary road
can afford little value in improving the
breed of cars. The plea that they reveal
the weaknesses of cars is sheer subter-
fuge ; a thousand-mile drive along ordi-
nary roads will reveal weaknesses far
better than any of these so-called sport-
ing events. The speed and mobility of
the car count for little in a road race
of half a dozen laps, during which about
20 sharp corners have to be negotiated.
And drivers don’t turn corners; they
would lose the race were they to slow
down sufficiently to turn. They just jamb
on their brakes and, by their mastery of
the machine, skid their way into another
position, tearing the treads from their
tyres and jolting the engines sometimes
beyond repair.
Some of these competitive cars are
never seen after the race is finished ; they
are finished, too. Others have deterior-
ated 50 per cent. In short, motor-rac-
ing on roads is useless and dangerous,
and the sooner the public demands its
abolition the better.—Grasspan (Vic.).
Poincare
Masterly were the remarks of “H.S.”
(B. 24/11/ ’34) concerning Poincare. I
was in Versailles the day Poincare was
elected President, and stood amongst the
curious when the insignificant-looking
little man came out of the Congress
Chamber. I saw him again during the
war (his visits to the front, dressed as a
chauffeur, were much commented upon),
during the Peace conference and during
the Victory March through the Arc de
Triomphe. Again, while sitting on the
same bench with Granville Ryrie and
General Pau, I heard Poincare pronounce
Foch’s funeral requiem in front of the
Invalides. Finally, I witnessed the funeral
of one of France’s greatest men and yet
one of her most modest citizens. — Pozzy
(Paris).
Tourists from India
Travelling through the greater part of
India last year, I remarked the scarcity
of Australian travel posters, except in
Bombay. Every year English residents
in India and some Indians take a two
or three months’ holiday in the Hills or
go to Europe, Japan or China. They
rarely visit Australia, Yet an Australian
tour would appeal to many; it is cheaper
than a holiday in the Hills, and would
bring them to a cool, healthy climate.
At my suggestion some Americans
living in India came to Australia last
year. They were delighted with their
trip, and intend to come again. Such
visitors should be encouraged. In my
experience they are interested in our
animals, aborigines and life outback,
not so interested in our cities. — Merle
Hamilton (N.S.W.). i
Pick-an i-cliovel Work
Time this press-fostered “humor”
about pick-and-shovel workers and the
Government stroke was counted out. If
the jokers tried to swing a 71b. pick, even
at T.G.S., for half an hour they would
see no humor in it, though it might leave
them with a respect for the real men who
wield the implement at any pace at all
(with “spells” of shovelling, almost as
strenuous) for eight gruelling, heart-
breaking hours. In Queensland navvies
work in muggy, sun-scorched railway-
cutting jobs under conditions which set
up muck sweats in people just look-
ing on.
These inhuman occupations should go.
They are degrading to the human
draught horses who follow them. — Old
Wreck (Q.).
Woolgrowers and Their Debts
The vaporings of Abbott, M.H.R. (B.
16/1 /’35), call for some comment. He
says woolgrowers are losing 2d. a pound
on wool and owe 255, per sheep. He
quotes no evidence, and there is actually
no justification for such grotesque asser-
tions. In any case, few graziers of ex-
perience would be alarmed at the pro-
spect of carrying on with a debt repre-
senting 255. per sheep, assuming always
that they have good country. Stations in
N.S.W. districts have lately changed
hands at prices equal to £3 to £4 per
sheep ; the buyers were men like Angliss
and the Stirton brothers. There is keen
“Come on, Storky—help me to get this out and I’ll go y’ halves"
competition for such properties when
they come into the market, but, generally
speaking, owners are sitting tight.
Mr. Abbott misses the point when
quoting aggregate figures which it is im-
possible to dissect. There are, admit-
tedly, many individual cases where men
are overloaded with debt; but how many
woolgrowers worth their salt have been
sold up by the banks or the wool firms?
The number is infinitesimal. No sec-
tion of the community receives greater
consideration at the hands of the finan-
cial houses ; the industry is known to be
inherently sound, and its great import-
ance to the country is recognised.
“The woolgrowers have never been
assisted by any Government.” One can
only assume that Mr. Abbott has never
heard of 8.A.W.R.A.; of reduced rail-
way freight-rates on starving stock and
on fodder for such stock; or of the
extension of Crown leases in Queensland
conditionally on the holders putting
rabbit-proof netting on their boundary
fences, and on their breeding and selling
a stipulated number of flock rams. —
Ex-Banker (N.S.W.).
Getting Things Undone
Mr. Lloyd George is starting a “Get
Things Done” movement. What is wanted
is a party that will get a lot of things
undone. As a lawyer, I say that every
piece of “constructive” legislation passed
by the N.S.W. Parliament during 40 years
has been a failure, and in most cases
has done far more harm than good. The
reason is plain. Our common law may
not be the perfection of human reason,
as Blackstone thought, but at least it is
the creation of generations of men who
found by experience what would work
best. Parliamentary law is, in most
cases, the creation of men who have no
qualification for their job of law-making,
and are ill-trained in either law or his-
tory —probably both. So surely as Parlia-
ment tries to “get things done,” it makes
a mess of it.
My programme for the new Get Things
Undone party, is: .
Repeal, erase or otherwise destroy 98
p.c. of all existing legislation. Wipe out
all existing boards, commissions and similar
Government undertakings.. If any of the
latter control anything worth selling, -sell
it to the highest bidder, and use the pro-
ceeds to repay some of our debts
(if it isn’t worth selling, it is not worth
keeping).
Sack the whole of the civil service, and
call for tenders for the work.
Farm out all taxes, with a proviso that
no taxpayer is in any event to pay more
than 2\ p.c. of his income.
These minor reforms having been
effected, Parliament might adjourn inde-
finitely, without pay, not to meet again
unless required to do so by a petition of
40 p.c. of the taxpayers. In 10 years’
time, the country would pay a dividend.
—Fitzwilliam (N.S.W.).
The Drift Citywards
It really commenced when steam began
to be a power, and will
increase in geometric
progression as civilisa-
tion improves. Anyhow,
Australians are not drift-
ing into the cities (B.
26/12/’34) as much as
the inhabitants of other
countries.
Five years ago I was
in California, much
boomed as the garden of
the world, where every-
thing is—or was then—
lovely, I worked out a
little sum. California has
a population about the
same as N.S.W. and Vic.
combined. It has an
area roughly similar. It
has two big cities of over
a million, as we have;
But in addition it has a
number of cities of over
100,000 where we have
one, a dozen over 50,000 where we have
four or five, and nearly a hundred of
from 5000 to 20,000 where we have about
20. I reckoned up the populations of
all ,he ,owns in Cali£ °™ a “d ‘hose of

1 turned then to the industrious peas-
antry of Northern France and Belgium”
who are so often held up to us as ex-
amples of what we should be, and I dis-
covered that their supposedly immense
rural population is obtained by regard-
ing in the figures all settlements of less
than 500 people as rural. Any Digger

This cry of the drift to the cities is all
bunk. People are going to drift to the
cities more and more as improvemen ts
in production become more common. In
the ’sixties in Victoria, eight men were
employed on the land to do the work
which one does to-day. Economic neces-
sity has driven seven out of every eight
producers off the land, apart from any
other cause. What is wanted is a system
of planning which would develop coun-
try towns. N.S.W. would be infinitely
better off were it to possess 10 cities of
100,000 each rather than one Sydney.—
G. Trotter (Vic.),
Uses for Twenty Millions
You should be well thanked by the
public for attacking the proposal to unify
our railway gauges at a cost of
£20,000,000 and upwards. As a con-
structive idea the plan is untimely, waste-
ful and perhaps out-of-date for ever. If
it should find acceptance the taxpayer
will in the end pay heavily. Professor
Shann has written that he never read or
heard a sound economic argument to
justify unification of the gauges. Defence
and employment could be promoted to a
much greater extent by the provision
of aerodromes, aeroplanes, seaplanes,
destroyers, submarines, patrol ships, and
by expenditure on training and equip-
ment.
If the Government has £20,000,000 to
burn, forestry should get its share. The
late Lord Novar told us when G.G. that
forestry found employment for more men
per mile of country than sheep runs and
could bring in more wealth.
We do not protect our existing timber
industry in a wise way. We sell abroad
some almost unique timbers —ironbark,
tallowwood, spotted and grey gum, karri
and jarrah—at a low price, and we charge
ourselves too much for Oregon, increas-
ing the cost of home-building. We should
have large storage and seasoning yards.
An expenditure approaching £10,000,000
could wisely be put into acquiring, hold-
ing and seasoning Australian timbers in
large yards in suitable centres —one at
least in each State. Under reasonable
management, the improvement in value
of timber properly seasoned would at
least pay the interest bill—and that the
railway proposition would never do.
Greater sales of our cabinet timbers
should be expected in future, and Aus-
tralia should be preparing something to
sell. —F. A. A. R. (N.S.W.).
Another Vicious Circle
On all hands, even from reactionary
sources, is heard the argument that civil-
isation cannot recover its economic equi-
librium unless the hours of labor are
curtailed. It is obvious, even to the
schoolboy, that if five men can dig a
trench in eight hours it will take 10 men
to dig it in four hours. He learns that
fact in his elementary lessons in arith-
metic.
But there are more factors in the
theory of reduction of hours than mere
arithmetic. If those 10 men—the present
five augmented by five now on the dole
—are to work only four hours daily,
they are going to have their wages re-
duced by 50 per cent, if they are paid
by the hour, and wages are already less
than sufficient to provide the worker with
a decent standard of comfort. To cut
them in half would mean something ap-
proaching the dole standard for the whole
population.
On the other hand, if it is proposed
to pay the men by the day—give them
the same wage for four hours’ work as
they formerly got for eight—the cost
of digging that trench will be doubled,
and people who want to have trenches
dug will look twice before they let the
contract.
Fewer trenches will mean fewer houses,
and rents will naturally double, for the
reduction will apply to all trades.
Further, consumable goods will also be
twice the price, for grocers and butchers
and bootmakers and tailors and weavers
will all be working half time for full
wages.
The whole suggestion recalls the device
of the ingenious apprentice who length-
ened a piece of cloth by cutting off one
end and sewing the spare bit on to the
other end. Hours of labor must come
down in the near future ; otherwise the
world will be flooded with unwanted
goods or half the population maintained
as pensioners on the other half. But the
reduction of hours in itself has little
bearing on the restoration of prosperity ;
that will need to be accomplished by
other means if it is accomplishable.—

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Asa trial for the Challenge Stakes,
nothing could have been more convinc-
ing than Emily Rose’s gallop in the
Berala Handicap at Warwick Farm. The
daughter of Rampion—Whitta, who car-
ries the colors of Mrs. H. A. Taylor,
wife of the studmaster, showed great
speed, and could have broken the track
record for “six,” but Pratt was pulling her
up from the Leger ; as it was, she beat
Veilantif and the consistent Cynical by
lengths in Imin. From 9st. 21b.
she drops to 6st. 91b. in Saturday’s sprint
race, and it looks only a matter of her
getting an uninterrupted run to score.
When Regal Son won the Metrop. in
1933 he was reckoned one of our best
stayers, but the leggy Australian Sun
gelding lost all form. He recovered it
startlingly on Saturday, and played with
the opposition in the January Handicap.
Going past Mystic Spell in a few strides,
he beat Mainlaw and High" Cross point-
less. He has 10 pounds less to carry in
the Anniversary Handicap (Bst., in fact),
and the Westralian-owned gelding looks
like carrying on the good work in that
race. He was ridden by Darby Munro.
Although only nine faced the barrier
in the Sefton Handicap, it was a rough
race, the favorite, Turbine, being almost
knocked over near the half-mile. Im-
pasto (5 to 2) won well from Bill Wedg-
wood, who came fast in the last furlong.
Croupier, who essayed to lead through-
out, was a fair third. Croupier was a
brilliant galloper in M.L., and he is a
quiet tip for the Challenge Stakes, in
ŵ
ẁ
ẃ
ẅ
which he will carry Bst. 81b. He is owned
by R. J. Murphy. Murphy had bad luck
in a Melbourne Cup with Concentrate,
who broke down when in a winning
position.
A.J.C. committeeman Hunter White
has a smart colt in Hadrian, who is by
Tippler out of Figure, a great sprinter
in her day. He is trained by Payten.
Jumping away smartly in the Nursery,
Hadrian was soon in command, and the
rest was a procession, as he beat Linklet
by three lengths, with Rummage a poor
third. Lord Sun, from the outside,
showed pace to finish fourth, but Sydney
Lad, a son of Sydney Damsel, though
supported from 14 to 1 to sixes, was
never in the picture. Hadrian (7 to 2),
Regal Son (7 to 2) and Emily Rose (5
to 2) were favorites.
North-western district pastoralist
Hunter Bowman gave the bookies a
clean sheet in the Novice. His Dark Fox
mare Silver Foam (20 to 1, nominal)
romped home from Geitel and Coinash,
the favorite, Adye, being anchored
by her 9st. The support for her was a
surprise, as she is not built to carry
weight. An outsider, Dandaloo, did well
to get fourth.
Parramatta sportsman F. E. Swannell
won the first division of the Maiden with
Foudroyant (7 to 2). She was set a diffi-
cult task, as she was badly placed
most of the way, but she came home
strongly, to down El Senorita —related
to Silver King on the dam’s side —with
Troy’s Gift third. The second division
proved a soft snap for Sally (7 to 1),
Achievement and Argue filling the places.
* * * *
Sol Green, who will shortly leave for
England to buy brood mares for his
Bacchus Marsh stud, won the Anniver-
sary Handicap at Caulfield with Worth-
ing, a Verbius three-year-old. In an open
betting race 6 to 1 was offered on the
field —11 runners —until Dick Devon
settled down as favorite at fives ; how-
ever, the little chestnut was only half
a point shorter than Worthing. Worthing
has suffered from suspensory-ligament
trouble in the near foreleg; he pulled up
lame after finishing third in the Wil-
liamstown Cup. On Saturday his gal-
loping action was free enough ; rushing
to the front three furlongs from home,
he scored with great ease from Three
Pips and Petau. Dick Devon came from
second-last at the five-furlong pole to
finish fifth. If Robertson could give
him more strenuous work Worthing
might develop into an outstanding stayer.
Remembering the ease with which
Heros landed the Standish Handicap,
punters refused to look past him as the
winner of the Tooronga Handicap.
Seldom are decent odds obtainable about
candidates from the Holt stable ; and it
was 6 to 4 Heros, although he had
9st. 71b. and was in receipt of only 21b.
from Gaine Carrington. Stretching out
in something like his old style, Gaine
Carrington disputed control with Heros
and Iskander as far as the home turn,
where his condition gave out; he pulled
up sound. Heros won brilliantly. He
seems to be the fastest sprinter in Vic-
toria, and should be cherry-ripe on New-
market Handicap day.
Skidmore was associated with the vic-
tory of Heros. Carpeted by the stewards,
he was suspended for a month for cross-
ing too sharply at the straight entrance and
causing interference to Iskander. In the
same race Preston, who is apprenticed
to Telford, was stood down for two
months on the ground of interfering with
Count Ito and Ogwell about a furlong
after the start. On the previous Satur-
day three riders —Ashley Reed, G. New-
ton and P. Simonds —were suspended at
Epsom. Last year Skidmore landed the
Oakleigh Plate on First Money. He will
be unable to take a mount in the 51-fur-
long sprint next month.
Neville Percival, the former Westralian
jockey, who piloted White Nose to vic-
tory in the Melbourne Cup of 1931, was
regranted a V.R.C. license on Friday
last, and rode at Caulfield. He finished
fourth in the Anniversary Handicap on
Crossfoy, and was third in the Tooronga
Handicap on Nappatara. During his
enforced “holiday” (21 years) Percival
kept himself physically fit by conducting
a riding school at St. Kilda. He was
able to go to scale at 6st. 91b. on Satur-
day.

“Bermuda”: That reference to the
masterly inactivity of the New York
Yacht Club and the non-esteem in which
it is held by yachtsmen outside its doors
in the States (B. 2/1 / ’35) reminds me
that Sydney, an ideal centre for yacht-
ing on the grand scale, is burdened with
an institution even more inept. This is
known to those in the secret as the Syd-
ney Yacht-racing Association, but it does
little to control or organise the sport
in Port Jackson. The Victorian Y.R.A.
is in a different category. It controls
and supervises Victorian yachting acti-
vities, and organised last year a large-
scale centenary yachting regatta with
prize-money totalling over £1500.^
“Cage”: Few would care to hazard a
bet that croquet has a greater following
in Australia than in Britain, but, accord-
ing to skipper Wemyss of the touring
English team, this is the case. The Eng-
lish leader says 120 would be a big entry
for an important tourney in England,
while Melbourne has recorded 1500 for
one tournament. Wemyss answers the
scoffer at his game by saying that first-
class croquet calls for as much self-
control and nerve as any other game.
He can .speak with authority, for in his
younger days he was a Rugby and polo
star.

Theresa Gamba has been nominated
for the Oakleigh Plate. If she takes her
place in the field, she will not lack sup-
port, but it has been an unfortunate race
for two-year-olds this century. It wasn’t
in the ’nineties: two-year-olds that won
then were Titan (1890), Camoola (’92),
Moorite (’94) and Coil (’96). The three-
years-and-over division has had an un-
broken run of success since.

Apart from weight-for-age races Hall
Mark is evidently to be reserved for
Rapdwick in the autumn. He is not
among the nominations for the Austra-
lian Cup, but figures in the Doncaster and
Sydney Cup lists. He has run his best
races in Sydney ; in fact, before his visit
last autumn, when he was obviously not
at his top, he had an unbeaten record
there. Asa two-year-old he won the
•Fairfield Handicap at Warwick Farm,
the Sires’ Produce Stakes (in the race-
record time of Imin, 24sec.) and the
Champagne Stakes at Randwick, and at
three years the A.J.C. Derby—in every
case by lengths. If the handicapper is
not too hard on him the little Heroic
horse will be one of the early favorites
for the Sydney Cup.

Winooka is out of the A.J.C. Chal-

to Melbourne. He has been nomi-
nated for the Oakleigh Plate, the Futurity
Stakes and the Newmarket, and if that
programme leaves him fit to race he is to
tackle the Doncaster and the C, W.
Cropper Plate. It will be interesting to
see what weight he gets in the Oakleigh
Plate and the Newmarket. Two years
ago he was second in the Plate (to Ibrani)
with 9st. 91b. and fourth in Waltzing
Lily’s Newmarket with the same burden.
Ins and Outs
“Wheat Lumper”: Hunt, the Balmain
all-rounder who went to England to play
League cricket in Lancashire and re-
turned to marry, has had his English con-
tract cancelled. Hunt has played in 11
Sheffields for N.S.W., and has taken 48
wickets at 20.5 each. Hill, a fairly regu-
lar bowler for Ma, is departing for the
wide, open spaces, and this leaves Hunt
as the only left-hand trundler of any
class in view.
* * * *
“G.M.”: Captains of first-grade Mel-
bourne cricket teams are in trouble be-
cause they arranged to play half a day
each side. It is contrary to Rule 22 b or
something of the sort. Asa matter of
reason, this system of playing cricket
might well be adopted everywhere. It
would make for far fairer results, elimi-
nating the element of weather and giving
the public a chance of seeing the best
batsmen and bowlers during one after-
noon. Of course, there would be no five-
day gates to collect; that’s the catch.
* * * *
“Glenelg”: It has been practically
settled that when the Australian XI comes
back from South Africa a testimonial
match to Grimmett and Richardson will
be played between the tourists and a
Rest of Australia side. It is to be hoped
the thing will be better managed than
the match for Woodfvn I. Then the
choosing of the Rest was left to Victoria,
which, with an eye on economy, selected
a second-rate lot, mostly from Victoria
and South Australia, and made a farce
of the match.
* * * *
“Mussock”: The Indian Board of
Control, being unable to get an official
visit from an Australian cricket team, is
trying to arrange for a “private” side to
play. India seems well out of it when it
comes to an official visit. After South
Africa England has to be entertained here,
and then a team is due to go to England
again. After that the West Indies must
be visited. By that time anything may
have happened.
* * * *
“Susie Swattit”: If the Australian girl
cricketers haven’t done well against their
English opponents in the field, they have
made a reputation as businesswomen
more enduring than chewing-gum. They
took care to get the cost of the tour in
the stocking before the invaders struck
Fremantle, and left gates out of con-
sideration. The visitors were just as
sporting; they paid their own fares.
The council’s profit, expected to be
over £IOOO after the third Test in Mel-
bourne, will be socked towards the
expenses of an Australian team for
England. After the Melbourne match
the tourists hop to M.L. for a month.
Then home via Panama.

records is particularly welcome in view of
the visit of an Australian team to the
Union at the end of this year, while club
and district cricket gets its full measure
of publicity.

“Hairy Heel”:
The N.S.W.
L.G.U. is look-
ing for trouble
in banning stock-
ingless legs on the links during official
matches. At Long Reef the other day
an associate and her partner were dis-
qualified because the lass wore nothing
between a pair of short socks and the
knee but an expanse of well-tanned skin.
Last year the Union lost the support of
Odette Lefebvre, as she then was, in
important matches for the same asinine
reason. Wowserdom has failed to keep
bare legs and shorts off the tennis courts.
Within a season or so they will be de
rigueur on the links, all the Tabithas in
N.S.W. to the contrary notwithstanding.
* * * *
“Brassey”: The scrap for the N.S.W.
A.I.F. Cup comes off on Feb. 27 at Ken-
sington, and the field is expected to be
larger than ever. The Victorian event in
November drew 600 entries, but traffic
blocks were avoided by using Royal Mel-
bourne’s two courses, one for the middle-
and high-markers and the other for the
men on the back marks. Something of
the sort will have to be done with the
Ma State meeting. One experiment in
the past has been to divide the show up
among different clubs, but this was found
a failure from the social point of view.
* * * *
“Coif”: Touching on golf casualties
(B. 12/12/’34), a recent decision in the
Irish courts is of interest. James Finegan,
a caddie of the Baltray G.C., was on the
job when his player, one McEvoy, hooked
a ball and hit him in the eye, destroying
it Finegan sued McEvoy and the club
for damages. The jury found against
the club, awarding £2OO damages, but
washed out the claim against McEvoy.
The judgment makes a club liable for any
damage done by its members provided
there is no contributory negligence by
the member, and this quite apart from
any question of compensation as between
the club and an employee on duty.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: The British golfing world
is much exercised over the decision of
Cotton to sign up again for the Waterloo
club in Belgium. Cotton’s decision auto-
matically cuts him out of the Ryder Cup
team in the annual match against Ameri-
can professionals, for only players resi-
dent in a country may represent it. There
is a strong feeling in both countries that
the restriction should be lifted.
* * * *
“Westward Ho”: The team of Eng-
lish women golfers is sharpening its col-
“Need you knock a man down like that?"
“Cripes, no — there’s plenty of other ways.”
lective niblick in preparation for a descent
on Australia. The British Women’s Golf
Union—they don’t use that shop-worn
word “ladies” there —has approved the
team, and all that remains for it is to
embark in July. Fremantle will be
reached on August 13, and after their
Australian programme is completed the
players go to M.L., leaving for home on
October 26 by the Panama route.
* * * *
“Dug Out”: Someone has suggested
in connection with the Ma State A.I.F.
golf competition that sideshows between
various branches of the service be held
in addition. He would like to see Light
Horse and Infantry pitted against each
other and the Gunners, for instance. But
the line cannot be drawn there. You
couldn’t leave out Ally Sloper’s Cavalry
and the Linseed Lancers, and then there
is the Staff Corps to consider, to say
nothing of the Jacks.
‘Divot Digger”; Golf is responsible
for some curious obsessions. Two Syd-
ney players, T. C. Roughley, of the
Museum, and G. J. Lane, a retired stock-
broker, keep a careful record of their
rounds, and, as they turn out to week-
end golf, no matter how impossible the
conditions, considerable book-keeping is
called for. At the end of a typical year
golfer No. 1 found he had played 87
rounds, and taken 7349 strokes in doing
so ; No. 2 had played the same number
of rounds with 7354 strokes.
Racquet and Bawl
The Australian selectors picked Craw-
ford, McGrath, Quist and Turnbull again
for the Davis Cup tour. Mrs. Crawford
is to accompany her husband, with a
promise of £375 for expenses, and Nor-
man Brookes will be captain-manager.
A very wise choice that, but the inclu-
sion of Turnbull is a mystery. It is semi-
officially stated that Crawford and Quist
will be the singles players, with McGrath
and Crawford for the doubles. What,
then, is the idea of Turnbull? Another
tried and tested doubles player is urgently
called for, and Hopman is available.
* * * *
“Kooyong”; A stir has been caused in
the Melbourne tennis rookery by the
alleged statement by Perry, after Craw-
ford had beaten him for the champion-
ship, that it might be their last meeting.
This has been taken to mean that the
Englishman will turn professional im-
mediately. It would be selling on a
bear market. If Perry waits until he
has benefited by his long spell in Eng-
land he will be a very different proposi-
tion at Wimbledon and in the Davis Cup.
He will have at least an even-money
chance of beating Crawford again in
Europe, and victory would skyrocket his
stock to the top of the market. Ever
since he left Eastern America the man
has been as stale as the tin of sardines
a golfing wifey leaves out for her old
man’s tea.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: The Czechs’ move to
lift the ban on amateurs accepting money
for playing exhibition games for film
purposes has found an unexpected backer
in Britain, and the motion will go before
the International Federation. It is not
likely to be accepted; France and
America have solidly opposed similar
whitewashing of professional dodges in
the past, and France carries the bulk of
the European vote. To the average man,
there seems no objection to anyone tak-
ing money for being filmed as a tennis-
player or as a two-up exponent. The
person writer objects to is the individual
with the chilled-steel cheek to persist in
being rated as an amateur after pocket-
ing the brass.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: London “Evening
Standard” is all warmed up over the
prospect of Perry turning professional.
There is only one way to avert the
tragedy, says the journal—removal of the
ban on film work by amateurs ; Perry
would scoff at open professionalism if
he could pocket the money offered him
for appearing in films. One other state-
ment is interesting as illustrating the out-
look of some folk on the sacrosanct
nature of sport. It is that, instead of
prohibitions, every star ought to be en-
couraged, handicapped as he or she is by
tennis and travel, to earn a “legitimate
living.” The notion of giving up tennis
and tackling real work for the purpose
does not even seem to have occurred
to the writer of the article.
% H* ifc
“Ratty Jack”: A craze for changing
the rules of all games and sundry seems
to have fallen upon British sport. Cricket
and football, to say nothing of billiards,
have recently been instances. Now some-
one suggests that a move be made to
temper the severity of the service which
often scores by its sheer pace. The idea
is to shift the service line within which
it would fall nearer to the net. Then
no low trajectory service could clear the
net and keep in the court unless the
server played on top of a pair of steps.
The idea is a fool one, and would only
benefit the mugs. Most players of any
class now take the ball on the half-
volley, as Norman Brookes showed the
world how to do.
Miscellaneous
“Splash”: Like other athletic bodies in
this country, the swimming people prefer
to make their guests from other coun-
tries earn their passage-money and board.
Consider the Japanese swimmers Saka-
gami and Kiyokawa. On their way to
Melbourne they were asked to get off the
train and show at Wangaratta. They
politely declined, Kiyokawa saying he
had developed a cold ; Sakagami, for his
part, was still convalescent from the
attack of influenza which ruled him out
of the N.S.W. championship meeting.

“Splosh”: Misguided friends are try-
ing to persuade Andrew Charlton that
he is still a world-beater. The other day
he swam in a handicap 440 in that
glorified duckpohd Sydney Domain
Baths, and covered the distance from
scratch in smin. 11 3-ssec. Quite good,
but 16 l-ssec. slower than his best. Yet
“experts” are trying to make out that this
little matter of 16 seconds or so can
easily be knocked off with practice and
bring the young man into the Olympic
team once more. Charlton should have
learned his lesson by now, but some of
them never do.
* * * *
“Splash”: Bill Kendall, who put up a
new Australian record in the 110 yards
N.S.W. championship (B. 16/1 /’35), is
the most modern of stylists. He seems to
have modelled himself on the latest thing
in hydroplanes. Instead of swimming
through the water he travels well on top
of it, and when he gets speed up seems
to progress in hops exactly like the
mechanical nuisances which infest Port
Jackson at week-ends. All the cog-
noscenti are confounded, just as the
tennis experts were when McGrath came
along.
“Bluebottle”: The proposed trip
abroad of an Australian surf lifesaving
team may become a round-the-world
affair. The programme at present being
worked out will take up to 18 months
to complete, comprising as it does visits
to most of the European countries, South
Africa and America. More than one of
these are already employing Australian
surf lifesaving methods, Natal, the surf-
ing centre of South Africa, having en-
thusiastically adopted them some years
ago. It is proposed to send 25 young
fellows. The cost will be tremendous,
but the promoters are confident the tour
would pay its way.
****
“Don Crew”: The Surf Lifesaving
Association packed up its gear last
week and shifted its quarters to Phillip
House, Phillip-street, Sydney, after hav-
ing been housed at the Sports Club for
27 years. During that period its ranks
have expanded from a mere handful of
enthusiasts to an army of more than 6000,
quartered in 75 clubhouses. Strong
branches exist in Queensland and West-
ralia, and there are affiliated clubs in Vic.,
S. Aus., Tas. and M.L.
“The Gaffer”: So Eddie Tolan con-
siders himself a distance runner because
he has broken evens in the 220 (B.
16/1 / ’35)? In my experience, dating
from the days of Jim McGarrigal and
his contemporaries, the 220 has always
ranked as the limit in sprint distances.
The distance runners come into the pic-
ture with the 440.
* * * *
“Calx”: It looks as if the great public-
school tradition on which England
builds so much has copped a black eye,
as they say in the board schools. The
heads of Eton are considering the aboli-
tion of the “Wall” game of football,
played by two sets of youths in heavily-
padded clothing who work along the
wall —the inside men of the Eton equiva-
lent of a scrum must keep in touch with
the bricks. The ground is about 50 yards
long; the goals are a tree trunk and a
door. The game is an annual one be-
tween the Collegers and the Oppidans. It
has no attractions as a spectacle and few
as an antiquity. In any case, the Wall
is beginning to fall to pieces.
* * * *
“Waterman”; That hardy annual the
Anniversary Regatta will be the 99th to
take place on Port Jackson, and will in-
clude the usual medley of rowing and
sailing events for all sorts of craft. It
has one unique feature —it is the only
regatta in which there are amateur and
professional rowers, though they do not
take part in the same events. As usual,
there will be no races for eights, but
there will be four-oared races for all
classes, as well as sculling and a Glad-
stone skiff event.
* * * *
“Stretcher”; “M.G.” (B. 2/l/’35) is
overrunning his slide when he bewails
the refusal of Australian oarsmen to
employ swivels, and ascribes the victory
of the English oarsmen at Henley-on-
Yarra to their use. Whatever may be
the case in Melbourne, Sydney oarsmen
have adopted the swivel rowlock for
some time, and Sydney crews rowing
against the English visitors were equipped
with the gadget. The first crew seen in
Sydney for some time to use the old-
fashioned poppets was the All-Black con-
tingent, which was also at Henley and
did better there than any of the “colo-
nials.”

Arnheim Land Gold
Arnheim Land Gold Development
(N.L.) came into being at Sydney with
the issue of a prospectus on February 21,
1933, by a company headed by John
Bailey, with Ernest H. Bailey as legal
manager and secretary. The main object
was
to purchase and develop a gold-bearing
reef discovered by Francis Birtles in Arn-
heim [really Arnhem] Land (N.T.) and in
respect of which the promoters have se-
cured a lease, numbered 66. of five square
miles from the Federal Government.
Months later an amended prospectus
was issued; it said that Mr. J. Bailey
had “an exclusive prospecting license,
numbered 66, for 12 months, with con-
ditional right of renewal.”
In the original prospectus it was stated,
apropos of the reef, that Mr. Birtles
had taken specimens from it on a “field
entirely new and never worked by any-
body but himself,” and in a locality “not
known to anyone” till the information
was “delivered under seal to the pro-
moters.” After holding the specimens
for a long period (a visit to Europe inter-
vened) he had them assayed. They
showed “15oz. to the ton.” Mr. Birtles
then “spent two years developing the
reef at a personal expenditure of over
£1000.” At the end of the time two
other assays—quantities and assayers
unnamed —showed 9oz. gold and lloz.
silver and 6!oz. gold to the ton. The
last specimen was said to be from the
cap of the reef.
An assay of a “small sample” sub-
mitted to the Electrolytic Refining Co.,
Port Kembla, by Mr. J. Bailey showed
gold 6oz. 4dwt. sgr., and silver 3oz.
18dwt. 20gr.
Mr. Birtles, in a letter published in
the original prospectus, characterised the
reef as “the best I have ever seen,” and
“with a deep sense of responsibility”
assured investors that
in my opinion it is destined to be one of
Australia’s greatest goldfields.... the most
promising gold propostion I know of in
Australia.
He undertook to remain with the work-
ing party “until I have proved that this
reef is all I say it is.”
The promoters wrote:
The reef has been tested, and its extent
and the assays from the lode area are of
a character which would strain the credul-
ity of those who have not had the oppor-
tunity to verify Mr. Birtles’s statements
The reef is of general uniformity, and
its surface richness indicates the probability
that it will be more richly gold-bearing as
it goes deeper. The ease with which the
reef can be worked makes it a most attrac-
tive proposition. In short, promoters feel
justified in stating that the reef will pro-
vide a maximum return for a minimum in
mining it.
In February, 1934, after Mr. John
Bailey had assured a meeting of share-
holders that “there was 1000 tons of ore
at grass and many more thousands wait-
ing for the battery,” and that “applica-
tions had been received for options from
England and America,” authority to pur-
chase crushing machinery was granted
to “fully develop the mine.”
On July 24 Mr. Pollard, the manager,
in his annual report mentioned the pur-
chase of a four-stamp battery capable of
treating 36 tons in 24 hours, rock drills
and accessories. Also, that the building of
80 miles of road to Pine Creek, as well as
12 bridges and the clearing of an aero-
drome, had been completed, and nine
loads of machinery delivered. He had
done 169 ft. of shaft-sinking, 53ft. of
crosscutting, 549 ft. of trenching and
2000 ft. of costeening. He said nothing
about quantity of ore at grass, but men-
tioned that two tons had been treated at
Port Kembla from three shafts, assay-
ing gold 4.310 z., silver 2.260 z.
A number of assays of samples, quan-
tities unspecified, was published during
the year, showing from loz. to lloz.,
and the annual report stated that the
mine should be well equipped before
September 30.
The Mines Department at Darwin was
strangely unexcited about the discovery
of this Eldorado, the capital of which,
in August, 1934, was increased to £50,000
by the issue of 100,000 fully-paid shares.
Mr. Dirties, the two Baileys and four
other promoters were to have divided
66,666 free shares, “each of 25., fully
paid.” In his 1933 report the Mines
Director took notice in the same district
of such operations as “a couple of miners
struck a small seam of gold carrying
visible free gold,” but he does not men-
tion Arnheim Land Development (the
total output of gold in the N.T. in 1932-
33 was 7120 z.). In November, 1934, he
refused permission to crush until the
co. “had pegged and applied for the
leases contained in exclusive prospect-
“A rise, eh? Certainly—take this!”
ing license No. 66.” Mr. Ernest Bailey
now writes that crushing will begin as
soon as the pegging of leases is complete;
It is impossible to estimate at the present
time how much is to be crushed, as the
battery installed is only a pilot plant to be
used in testing the various leases, i.e., 80,
for flotation purposes.
This notwithstanding that the co. had
“1000 tons of ore at grass” 11 months
before, and that the purchase of crush-
ing machinery had then been authorised.
The directors affirm that “the com-
pany was originated for development and
prospecting purposes, and it was never
intended to work the area in its entirety.”
(One of the objects in the original pros-
pectus is “to work, develop and dispose
of leases acquired by the co.”)
Though stress was laid in the original
prospectus on the ease of working
the reef and on its accessibility (“it
is within easy distance of the rail-
head”), Mr. Ernest Bailey on January
16 could not be precise as to when
crushing would take place; “contact
with the mine” had “not been made for
three weeks.” He added that an aero-
plane was arriving at Darwin and “con-
tact should be made on the 20th inst. ;
further reports” should follow.
Shares now stand at 9s. or thereabouts.
They have been as high as 18s. 3d. If, as
Mr. Birtles wrote, “this reef is the most
promising gold proposition I know of in
Australia”—and Mr. Birtles is a bike-
rider of credit and renown —a Sydney
Stock Exchange inquiry could do no
harm.
Justice Halse Rogers has delivered his
final report on McArthur’s “trust” cos.
It is recommended that the Southern
British National Trust should be put into
liquidation if the Maoriland commission
decided upon a similar course with the
Investment Exec. Trust Co. (of N.Z.),
which the Southern British Co. largely
controls. “The investigation,” said the
Royal Commissioner, “revealed clearly
that McArthur had used several of the
cos. presumably for the purpose of
covering up his own transactions, and
also for the purpose of diverting for his
own ends the capital subscribed by the
public from the cos. to which it had been
subscribed.”
, . . . ....
The dollar-exchange position is still
puzzling the world. Before the devalua-
tion took place —at any rate, before
USA left the gold standard—the New
York price of fine gold was $20.67 an
A A rir»i re
ounce, and the party & ‘
with sovereigns was $4.86 to the £l.
Then Roosevelt, following legislation
which made the gold clause in public and
private securities void, raised the price
of fine gold to $35 an ounce. Assuming
that new gold dollars were minted, their
gold parity with sovereigns would be
about 8.02 to the £l. But the quotations
in the foreign-exchange tables in the
world press have continued to show parity
as $4.86 to the £l. This procedure
seemed to be indefensible ; the new 59-
cent dollar was accepted in the exchanges
at somewhere near its new parity. The
daily-paper quotes, however, may at last
prove themselves to be right.
The possibility of a Government defeat
in a U.S. Supreme Court case concerning
the voiding of the gold clause in bonds
led to a panic in the exchanges, especially
in Paris, whence gold has been leaving
for IST York. The £1 sterling also depre-
ciated. It is announced that defeat in
the court will make no difference to
Roosevelt’s policy.

“Zad”: The N. S. W. Companies Bill
does not provide for the filing of
companies’ balance sheets with the Regis-
trar. Nor does it make any provision
for policy-holders having a say in the
appointment of directors to the boards
of proprietary life offices. Policy-holders
in such concerns often represent the dog
and the shareholders the tail, but the tail
usually wags the dog. “Trustees” are
generally of limited jurisdiction, and of
little practical value to policy-holders.

Following an animated market in
London for Westralian mining scrip in-
fluenced largely by the promising nature
of the Yellowdine field—Australian
’Change operations, particularly in Adel-
aide, have shown revival. Some London
brokers who normally concentrate on
West Africans are giving attention to
Westralian shows.

At the opening 1935 wool
sales in London, with mainly
Australasian wool on offer,
prices were generally 5 p.c.
higher than the closing quota-
tions in 1934. There was
some German bidding, with
keen competition between
British and Continental buy-
ers. Sales of Australasian
wool totalled 7464 bales out
of offerings aggregating 8526
bales.

Australia’s egg exports to
Britain last year totalled
20,030,000 dozen, helped
largely by concessions
granted under the Ottawa
Agreement. (In 1931 they
totalled only 5,970,000
dozen.) In furtherance of its
policy of absorbing its own
elderly unemployed in rural
industries the British Govern-
ment hints at a quota. Mr.
Lyons will have plenty to
negotiate about when he gets
to London.

“Hel ston”; Australian
chilled beef is being delivered in
London in excellent condition, thanks
to the use of CQ2 gas in hermeti-
cally sealed ships’ chambers, the gas
preventing the formation of mould.
An obstacle to the introduction of
stud stock of the chilling type has
simultaneously been overcome. In the
past stock from Britain shipped in show
condition suffered severely in the Red
Sea heat; in some instances, beasts cost-
ing 2000 and 3000 guineas died. In the
case of a shipment consigned in the
.Shaw Saville steamer Coptic, an un-
usual adaptation of methods used for
carrying perishables was applied; the
cattle, in padded stalls ’tween decks, were
cooled by a system of cargo fans and
air ducts. Result: all were landed in
prize condition.

“Dungeness”: Broome (W.A.) is in a
bad way. Shell costs £l4O per ton to
raise, and average price last year was
£lO5. Takes are good, but the propor-
tion of pearls and baroque is low. Bigger
boats with power air-compressors to
supply two divers are to be tried as a
last hope by the larger organisations. A
subsidy of £2O per ton has been asked
for; but Broome is a long way from
Canberra and has few votes.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
“Kaloa”: The “new” scheme for the
development of the Barkly Tableland has
been canvassed for a couple of decades
—co-operative development of about
22.000 square miles of country, with a
railway to the McArthur and a port, a
rest station and meatworks at Vanderlin
Island. There are difficulties. The Mc-
Arthur is a shallow river with many bars.
The country along its banks carries
plenty of feed, but is sour. There is a
flood season which would annually cause
a lot of damage to a railway, and there
is a great deal of work to be done at
Vanderlin before a satisfactory port can
be established there. At the same time,
the plan is the best on which a Govern-
ment so far has looked with favor.

“Vic”; The annual report of the
Queensland Sugar Bureau estimates
Queensland production for 1934 at
4.471.000 tons of cane, a decline of
195,978 tons; yield will be about
630.000 tons, against 638,000, there
being an increased sugar content over
last year’s of one
ton sugar to 7.31
tons cane. The
yield per acre will
be a record. The
increase in cane
yield in a decade
has been about
1.500.000 tons, and
of sugar about
220.000 ton s —in
each case 50 p.c.
advance. Ten
years ago there
were people in the
North who be-
lieved that sugar
had “reached its
limit,” but, with an
increase of 60,000
acres under crop
in the period and
an average per
planter of 42 acres,
the industry has
added about 25
prosperous settlers
per annum to the
northern popula-
tion.

“Kaloa”: Civili-
sation is being
brought to the
Papuan with a ven-
geance. Port
Moresby even has
its “native caddies’
day” on the golf
course. The driv-
ing com petition
shows no pheno-
menal distances —it
was won last month
with 150 yards. But the six-hole A-grade
match brings out relatively good golf.
The winner produced a card of 25—5,
4,5, 4,3, 4—against bogey of 22. Which
is good going when it is remembered that
clubs have to be made by the competi-
tors, and consist of anything from a bit
of bent piping on the end of a sapling
up to reconditioned mashies.

“Murlonga”; The Bulla-bulla waterhole
near Boulia (N.Q.) is the abode of devils.
A purinthy chased a young gin out on the
limbs of a coolabah and dived into the
water with her. Some reports state that
parts of her were recovered. Others
verify the fact that her gurgling sobs can
be heard to this day. No blacks will
now camp near Bulla-bulla, though they
crawl trembling to the edge, look once
and go like scalded cats. Another debbil-
debbil resort was at old Austral home-
stead (N.T.), on a big bend where the
Rankine joins the Georgina. During
the late Isaac Little’s time a gin died
there. The other blacks immediately left.
Up to 30 years after blacks working their
way up the river would leave it at the
Dead Dog, 10 miles downstream, and go
across the high downs, to hit the river
again 10 miles above the old homestead,
in preference to going in there.
* * * *
“Vic”: There has been drought in the
N.T. Darwin, which usually has 11 in. of
rain in December and 15in. in January,
did not even have lin. in December,
1934. Fifty per cent, of the town wells
went dry, as did the railway dams, and
water-trains ran to the Darwin River,
34 miles away. Now, the monsoon has
broken.

“Eck de Sulzbach”: “Quartan” (B.
9/l/’35) need not look as far afield
as Ceylon for an example of the
terrors of malignant malaria. In
1864 Burketown (Q.) was practically
wiped out by the “black sickness. ’
Malays, crossing over in praos, are
regarded as responsible for its intro-
duction. The tale runs that about a
fortnight before malaria broke out a
sailing-boat from Java was found in a
near-by creek with the entire crew dead
of fever. The disease was at that time
thought to be yellow fever, and in the
old death registers of the district can still
be seen the gruesome entry “Yellow
Jack” after the names of victims of this
outbreak.

“No. 2 Bore”: An example of how the
N.T. air mail works: Daly Waters is
50 miles from the railhead at Birdum.
Birdum is 315 miles from Darwin.
Letters from Birdum to Daly Waters are
taken by train to Darwin and then flown
back to Daly Waters. They travel 680
miles to cover 50 miles. In Birdum we

sometimes think the pilot’s wave to us
is a bit derisive.

It seems to me that to erect
palatial hotels is the wrong way to go
about developing these Barrier islands.
The germ of the right scheme was on
Magnetic (Townsville), where a few years
ago (I don’t know if they still can be)
camps could be hired by parties. The
Americans have developed the camp idea
to perfection in their more remote tour-
ist resorts. Nothing would induce me
to renew memories of the North in an
island tourist hotel. But I am sure that,
with cheap fares and quick transport and
a comfortable log cabin with bunks, light-
ing, decent food and a guide-cook to
be hired at reasonable cost, hundreds
would flock to the restful solitude of the
islands.

“Wycarbah”: There is no dearth of
new settlement or of land in Queensland.
The Government has decided to open
400,000 acres in the Theodore district
(C.Q.) for mixed farming and dairying
in blocks which will average 3300 acres,
and 1,750,000 acres in north-west and
central districts. Some of the earliest
subdivisions will be on Terrick Terrick
and Lome (Blackall),, and selections on
Portland Downs and Tocal already are

Legal Notice.
MARY ANNE STONE, deceased, supposed to
be the daughter of John Stone, of West Mait-
land, New South Wales, hotelkeeper, deceased,
and Mary Anne Stone {nee Dunn), deceased.
Pursuant to an Order of the Supreme Court
of New South Wales, in its Equitable Jurisdic-
tion, dated the 21st day of August, 1934, and

lowing inquiry was directed, namely:
Who were the Statutory next-of-kin ‘of the
said Testatrix at the date of her death (on
the 20th December 1933) entitled to certain
shares of residue of her estate as to which
she had died intestate and whether any of
them have since died and if so who are
their respective legal personal representa-
tives if any.
NOTICE is hereby given that all persons
claiming to be entitled under the said inquiry
are to send by post prepaid to the undersigned
so as to reach him on or before the sth June,
1935, their full Christian and surnames,
addresses and descriptions, and full particulars
of their claims, or in default thereof they will
be excluded from the benefit of the said Order
unless the Court or a Judge thereof or the

“Onambatutu”: I can give “General
Prac.” one reason why measles have slain
so many Pacific Islanders (B. 12/12/’34).
In the long ago I was plunged into the
midst of a large Papuan community
smitten with the epidemic. There was no
doctor in the whole of the Possession
then (it was British N.G. at that time),
and all that could be done by the local
mission and myself was to tell what suf-
ferers we encountered to keep warm and
avoid chill. When the fever irked them,
however, they promptly piled into the
river running past their doors. As this
dropped from a 12,000 ft. range in less
than 100 miles the water was always cool.
Pneumonia did the rest. Later I was to
learn that the same practice had been
followed by the natives throughout the
Possession, with staggering mortality
statistics as a result.

“M. Turlutu”: The Queensland swim-
ming championships furnished another
proof of the dreadful effects of a tropical
climate on the white race. The 220 yards
freestyle went to a Rockhampton lad. A
Cairns girl won the 100, the 220 and the
440, and another maid from the same
awful place not only ran away with the
junior 50-yard championship but put up
a new record of 30 2-ssec.
“Kwakprak”: Hookworm is poking
up its ugly head again in Queensland and
northern N.S.W., and timely measures
should be applied to prevent it from be-
coming unmanageable. The Rockefeller
campaign of a dozen years ago did much
good, but the American fuss-and-blare
methods were unsuited to Australian
psychology, and make effective action
more difficult to-day. Many parents in
infected districts, recalling the American
“stunts,” are only bored at the mention
of hookworm, and regard it as a joke.
It is no joke. Nationally, it is probably a
more serious matter than the well-adver-
tised Weil’s disease, but the “Aw, gee,
mum, I’m all right” attitude of the in-
fected youngster and the parents’ re-
membrance of “stunts” make treatment
difficult.

Ena Crease, who married John Michod
on January 18, was the guest of honor
at numerous teas before the ceremony.
Mrs. H. E. Crease entertained a large
party of guests, who inspected daughter’s
lovely trousseau; and that night the
Crease home was brilliantly lighted and
filled with flowers for a cocktail party.
Marie Magee, whose own wedding is
drawing near, was hostess at another
party.
Mrs. Wallace Watkins and niece Kath-
ryn Hutter, who are to make their
home in Sydney, were farewelled by
Mrs. Errol Campbell. Crazy bridge
amused the guests, and chrysanthemums
and Christmas bells made the reception
rooms lovely.
Mrs. Hugh Hamilton, visiting Brisbane
from Toorak (Melbourne), gave a tea at
Lennon’s. Carnations decked the table,
and the hostess, in leaf-brown and white,
added a posy of the same fragrant flow-
ers to her ensemble.
The F. Treuthardts (the lady was Enid
Dickson) are back from Melbourne,
where they forgathered with Katharine
Prichard, Enid’s cousin, and also saw a
good deal more of the Russian Ballet,
which contains several close friends of
the pair.
Mrs. Albert Gollnick, a school-teacher
in America before she married the Aus-
tralian representative for Swifts, has just
had her third book of poems published.
She writes under her maiden name, Hilda

Pauline Butler, daughter of the Roy
Butlers, is at present in Brisbane stay-
ing with Mrs. Roy Darvall. Then she is
going to Southport to visit Dr. and Mrs.
Eric Molle. Nora Butler is still at Stag-
hurst, but she is one of the intending
tourists, and in April will leave for Eng-
land with Mr. and Mrs. B. G. White.
Tall Winifred Ponder has been in-
vited to become a fellow of the Royal
Society of Arts. She spent Christmas in
Singapore with a bunch of cousins from
South Australia who were touring
Asia, and is returning to London early
in February.
News comes from India that Margery
Armstrong, younger daughter of Mrs. D.
Armstrong, of Clayfield, is holidaying in
Calicut, after a visit to Cochin China,
where she stayed With Mr. and Mrs. W.
Grant.
Eileen Ralph got in first with her tea
for Marie Lorenzo, who marries A.
Allan this month. Eileen’s party was at
the Quarters, Victoria Barracks, and
Mrs. E. M. Ralph lent a hand in enter-
taining.
Chief Justice Blair and his wife will
not live at Government House while Sir
Leslie and Lady Wilson are away. They
will keep their suite at the National
Hotel; meanwhile they are at Southport
until the end of the month.
As soon as Douglas, J., and his wife
and family vacated Kia Ora at South-
port, Mr. and Mrs. E. K. Tully and the
Harry Morts, of Franklyn Vale, moved
in. Mrs. Tully’s parents, Mr. and Mrs.
R. H. Levien, who stayed with her over
Christmas, have gone back to Sydney.
Marjorie Mant and Mabel McAlister
go to England by the Ormonde on Janu-
ary 24, and at Melbourne Professor and
Mrs. Richards and Peggy will join the
ship. There have been several farewell
teas for Marjorie, one of the brightest
being the picture party arranged by
Nancy Forrest.
By the Nankin arrived a very interest-
ing Australian-born, Mavis Ming, en
route to Sydney University. She was
only nine when her parents returned to
China, and since then she has lived in
Hong Kong and Shanghai, with a few
years in a retired Chinese village. Child-
ren of 31 nationalities were at the school
at which she matriculated. Science will
probably be her subject.
Twenty-four university girls from Perth,
on a pleasure cruise to Noumea, arrived

Mrs. M. Rutter has come along as
chaperon. Frank McGrath, president of
the University Union, and Jean Astill,
president of the University Women’s
Club, met the Perth contingent at the
wharf and entertained them at a picture
party and motor tours.
Also on the Mongolia were Mr. and
Mrs. Peter Dennis, newly-weds. The
lady was Madeleine Mackay Sim, a
Queenslander. Bill King, who was best
man, and several other friends were on
the wharf to meet them.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Those pleasant people the Games left
Sydney by the Baradine last week, and
now Government House is being got
ready for its next tenants, the Hore-
Ruthvens. The going-away of the Games
caused as wild a flutter as the arrival of
Prince Henry. From far and wide citizens
turned up to line Macquarie-street to
wave a last good-bye as the popular pair
drove for the last time through the city.
Over 7000 squeezed into Martin-place
to see the Governor place a wreath on the
Cenotaph—his last official act in Sydney.
The day was grey, but the pennants of
the Lancers and the white and blue of the
Mounted Police made a brave showing
in the escort, and the front of Sydney
Hospital looked like a wildly waving
snowdrift; every nurse and wardsmaid
who could get off duty for a minute was
doing her bit, led by Matron Kellett’s
hanky.
The notes of a trumpet echoed, seven-
teen guns boomed out, sixteen aeroplanes
roared against the grey skyways. Girl
Guides, Boy Scouts and men who fought
in the South African war were mixed up
in the doings. Down at the man-of-war
steps there were last good-byes to old
friends and the Government House staff,
and last messages to the women of New
South Wales from Lady Game. Against
the lobelia blue of her soft woollen coat
she clasped two bunches of red roses that
had been thrown into her car. More
flowers, more handshakes; the Lieut.-
Gov. Streets, Archbishop Mowll and his
wife, Premier Stevens, Harry Budge and
Hubert Murray’s lady were among the
final leave-takers. Through all the emo-
tion that surged around, the white-clad
naval ratings kept a stiff upper lip and
the correct stance. Then came the
National Anthem. After that the launch
Premier, surrounded by police launches
and naval cutters, and accompanied by
the drone of the 16 ’planes, took the vice-
regals out to the Baradine, which was
waiting off Fort Macquarie.
There are some to whom modesty is
synonymous with the many petticoats of
the Victorian miss. To others Godiva
engaging in her Challenge Stakes is sym-
bolical of virtue. But Minister for Local
Government Spooner, the arbiter of the
State’s beach fashions, seems to have
struck the right balance in deciding on
the designs for N. S, Wales’s swimming-
suit. The girl who likes sun-tanned ver-
tebrae sighed with relief when she found
that the whole of her back down to about
her kidneys can legally go bared to the
sun and ozone, and that a costume with
Sin. of leg will leave a fair stretch of
firm-muscled limb exposed to the breeze.
However, the new regulations won’t come
into force this summer, so all the beach
belles with brassiere tops to their suits
or starfish and other fancywork cuts
about their raiment need not rush to buy
new togs Men, too, must be covered up
to the armpits in the front —in fact, all
persons over four are going to be made
modest by law.
Westralians in Sydney will miss genial
Walter Kingsmill from their friendly
“wongis.” The Senator was always one
of their most popular speakers, and many
exiles from his State were at St. Andrew’s
when he entered upon his last lone jour-
ney. In the afternoon twilight of the
cathedral his black-clad widow sat as
though stunned. Even the sympathy of a
group of close friends could not penetrate
such grief. It was a State funeral. Flowers
were piled high about the coffin, poli-
tical colleagues paid tribute. Bishop
Kirkby gave the address, and in the
long aisles Youth as well as Age mourned
a friend’s passing.
Sales and rumors of sales are on every
hand. Shops must be loaded down
with unsold summer materials, for the
rain of our discontent falls every day, and
last winter’s costumes and raincoats are
the most seasonable wear. With the
autumn styles knocking at the door, and,
indeed, in some cases already parading in
screened-off ends of the dressmaking
salons, the lot of the bargain-hunter and
the remnant-snatcher promises to be fair
as some poppy dream. While chiftonery
is going at counter-lunch rates, it is fas-
cinating to dally among the rough and
sometimes hairy-surfaced tweeds that will
be the subject matter of the sports suit
of autumn. To wear a sports suit now
does not mean that you are olf for a day
with the guns, about to climb Everest or
tackle winter games ; so the suit can be,
and often is, doo-dahish, with flat-fur
necktie and dado round the skirt. Silver-
fox, fastened together pelerine fashion,
and loose swagger coats of dyed squirrel
were styles that made a direct appeal. So
did some imported
shoes in raisin-
colored suede to
match a turban
toque. But the
price, £7 19s. 6d.,
called for feathers
burned under the
nose.
In the warm mois-
ture to which we
wake up daily Miss
Sydney is beginning
to feel a bit mil-
dewed. At such
places as Palm
Beach and Terrigal,
Bondi and Manly,
the curl comes back
into her smile —you
go there to get wet,
anyway, she philoso-
phises. This sum-
mer the mountain
ways have come
back to their own,
and are luring their
hundreds. Leura is
having a gay little
season, but Leura is
always one of the
most popular of our
plateau villages. In-
cidentally, almost as
soon as they had
waved the Games
and the Baradine
through the Heads
the Lieu t.-G ov.
Streets hied them to
Hill View. Sutto">
Forest. From this
summer vice - regal
dugout only affairs of State or urgency
will coo-ee them.
Turn to the right from the model of
the alert-looking foxy guarding the dog-
kennels and the puppy-baskets and you
come to the brand-new and shining
white Animal Clinic on Anthony Hor-
derns’ fourth floor. Dogs of all shapes
and sizes were sitting about moodily and
a trifle nervily last Friday afternoon —just
like patients in the doctor’s waiting-room,
except that they were not asked to browse
on prehistoric magazines. B. A. Mc-
Michan, who has had wide experience,
his clientele embracing bull-terriers,
pekes, Alsatians and poms, and even the
little native bear, is the man in the white
coat who puts doggie on the table, feels
bones and tummy, hearkens to his cough
and then prescribes the treatment.
An operation was prescribed for one
very sick little lady. A fluffy ball of black
hair was ordered a diet of raw meat.
Didn’t his eyes sparkle? But there were
castor oil and milk for the foxy that fol-
lowed ; while the gentle white-and-black
setter with the miserable eyes that can-
not use his right-side legs since an argu-
ment with a car at Christmastime had
to be hurried off for an X-ray. Coughs,
gastritis, broken bones, malnutrition: it
would seem that a canine is as hard to
rear as a baby. With the sick came small
boy and girl owners with mother
attached, big schoolboys, youths, stern
men, troubled elderly women. Only one
peke refused to be overawed. He barked
continuous contempt.
Of the treasured possessions taken
away by Lady Game none is being more
carefully guarded than the flannel-flower
plants she has raised from seeds out of
the bush garden of Mrs. Sterling Levis,
of Vaucluse. Waratahs bloom in Eng-
land, and our native flora does particu-
larly well in the Channel Isles, according
to novelist G. B. Lancaster, whose
brother has had luck with them in his
Jersey garden. But the growing of
flannel-flowers in Dorset, the Games’
county, will be something of an experi-
ment.
Herewith Mrs. Idwal Jenkins, more
generally known as Marguerite Cullen
Ward, whose clever characterisation of
small boys and young schoolgirls is a
feature of the Independent Theatre pro-
ductions. Besides acting, Marguerite
specialises in tap dancing. Her father
is Consul for Portugal.
Now that the lucky stars and the
horseshoes that glittered for so many mad,
glad moons above the lottery-ticket shops
have been plucked down and cast into
the discard, another touch of romance
has gone from the life of the business-
woman. There was something entrancing
in hopping through an entrance above
which a white star blazed to receive in ex-
change for your shilling, not only the slip
of paper that (your star being in the
ascendant) would turn into 1000 pound
notes, but also your sign in the zodiac. A
list of your lucky numbers and lucky
gems filled you with an insane desire to
go and breathe all over the nearest
jeweller’s window.
The Savoy was Sydney’s fashion centre
on Saturday night. The women wore
fine feathers and the men sported tails
for the opening of the Independents’
season. The'play was one of the Group’s
early successes —“And So to Bed.” The
repetition was partly in response to many
requests, and partly to give Clarence
Murphy a chance for a farewell per-
formance of his Charles 11. before he
goes to London. The black ringlets and
black velvet of the philandering Stuart
left a good last impression of Clarence’s
slim length. Albert Collins strutted in
grey and rose brocades as Pepys, the
great consumer of ink, and was watched
by bright-haired daughter Kathleen from
the front stalls. Here also was seated
English visitor Mrs. Duff, a keen air-
woman, whose great ambition is to help
keep Bondi beach safe by catching a few
sharks. With her were mother Mrs.
Payten, Oswald Cheeke and Patrick
Bellew. Phillip Lewis and Harry Tighe
were other theatre-minded folk. Ger-
trude Johns ushered in demure pink
chiffons.
All Sydney was not at the international
tennis on Saturday. A few hundreds
strolled up to the National Gallery to
look at the Archibald portraits ; and let
one say here and now that displaying the
pictures on the ground floor instead of
in the tombs of the Gallery is worth a
cheer. If Michael Arlen ever sees the
self-portrait of Hanke, the prizewinner,
he’ll be inspired to create still another
of his Mayfair but manly heroes. There’s
just the sensitive expression, the sub-
dued swagger in the carriage of shoulders
and head which the novelist never tires
of. But is it harder to paint women than
men? Most of the ladies in the show
seem a bit on the formal side —all dressed
up and a bit conventional. This remark
doesn’t apply to Mary Gilmore or
Katharine Susannah Prichard. Katharine,
smartly tailored in buffs and browns,
looks more county than comrade. Mel-
bourne artist Miss Bale looks out of her
frame with placid directness, and a lovely
snowflake blonde known as “The Golden
Girl” captured the fancy. But why was
the blue riband shown against her white
coat? That may be aesthetic, but it’s just
an etcetera in dress.
Daphne Harpur, the Sydney pianist,
who has now inserted her two feet within
the portals of 8.8. C., drops a cheerful
note from London. Her particular good
fairies in the big city are Miss Mac-
Donald, of the Isles, and Lady Frances
Ryder, to whom Miss MacDonald is
secretary. Much hospitality has come
Daphne’s way as the result of her asso-
ciation with Lady Frances Ryder’s club.
Joyous reference is made to a week spent
at the historic home of the Dimsdales, in
Hertfordshire, a manor packed with the
shades of ancestors ; also to a delightful
stay at the Cleeves family seat, in Aber-
gavenny (Wales). Miss Harpur is to give
her first London recital next month under
the wing of the London Musical Club, of
which Princess Beatrice is patroness.
Enid Lorimer and Gordon Forsyth,
who direct the activities of the Studio
Theatre, last week celebrated the first
anniversary of its formation. The party
was also a house-warming to the theatre’s
new home at Emerson Hall, Liverpool-
street. Dancing interspersed with one-
act plays was the fare. The club is grow-
ing rapidly. Though only in existence 12
months it has a membership of over 100.
Miss Lorimer has been associated with
the stage from childhood. Her first en-
gagement came from Beerbohm Tree,
who selected her, when very young, to
understudy Phyllis Neilson-Terry.
Helen Adams, who was one of Prince
Henry’s dancing partners during the
Canberra jubilations, was one of last
week’s brides in the Federal capital.
Bridegroom was Lieut. Charles Finlay,
aide-de-camp to the G.-G. Sir Isaac Isaacs
and his lady were among the few wed-
ding guests who, after the knot-tying in
the old church of St. John’s, gathered at
the Adams home with congratulations.
The wedding garment was a plainly-cut
but attractive little affair in pale-blue
crepes. The tilted-over-one-eye hat was
of the same melting shade.
On Saturday the White City, green
and fair, basked in the summer’s bright-
est day. Flags of many lands fluttered
in the slight breeze, and crowds thronged
the stands to watch the international
tennis. The women got back to old
summer form in the brightness of their
frocks. The Italian Consular couple
came early, with daughter Virginia; Mrs.
Jack Crawford’s white muslin collar was
deep and frilled ; Joan Hartigan stabbed
her white panama with a brown quill,
and Dorothy Dingle cunningly mixed
blue and white in her attire. Mrs. H. S.
Utz was another of the keen initiates.
She was smart in black and white. Ruth
Allen’s red-and-white outfit was almost
as interesting as the match between
Crawford and Menzel, and Aileen Peach
wore Shantung scattered with Parma-
violet spots.

Mel bourne
Chatter
It is many moons since Melbourne
experienced such perfect holiday weather
as we had last Saturday. Races at Caul-
field, the beaches and swimming cham-
pionships at the new Olympic pool had
a large share of patrons, and a very
satisfactory crowd rallied to the M.C.C.
for a look at the third women’s Test
match. The Australian team has im-
proved upon the Vic. team’s sports
dresses ; its members wear white linen
shirts tucked into divided skirts, which
would be much smarter if they were a
few inches shorter, for the backs dang-
ling below the knees look all wrong with
pads. The Englishwomen’s example of
white stockings has been followed, hats
when worn are of white pique or linen,
and arms and necks are a uniform brown
from so much open-air sport.
Garden parties are usually only mildly
enjoyable functions, but the afternoon
reception given by the Governor and
Lady Huntingfield upon the green sward
of G.H. was particularly pleasant. Guests
were members and associate members of
the Association for the Advancement of
Science. Most of them share a common
interest, respect one another’s brains and
are glad of an opportunity to meet old
friends and make the acquaintance of
inter-State representatives. On arrival
everybody drifted into a queue around
the lawn leading to the lee of an island
shrubbery, where Lord and Lady Hunt-
ingfield received with Douglas Mawson
and his lady. With her gown of flowered
crepe, Lady Huntingfield wore a wide-
brimmed black hat, softened around the
crown with wisps of ostrich feathers. The
Mawson lady, her height as command-
ing as that of her hostess, wore white
sleeves in her black-and-white gown, a
black hat and long golden earrings, par-
ticularly suitable to her type of looks.
Her daughters Pat and Jessica wore
youthful silk frocks sprigged with blue
and white. After the formal reception
there was a general move to the ball-
room across the terrace, where two giant
magnolias are in bloom and the disused
fountain is ablaze with petunias sur-
rounded by a narrow garden of begonias.
What a nuisance hard hats are for
men who are expected to keep wives and
daughters supplied with tea, sandwiches
and strawberries! If they are left on the
velvet seats running round G.H. ball-
room they are liable to be sat upon
by absent-minded professors. Speaker
Everard was noticed juggling with a
meringue. Frank Stillwell, who knows
from experience what the South Pole
feels like, accounted for some straw-
berries and cream. Captain J. K. Davis
refused ice-cream—he has been down
near the South Pole so many times that
possibly he prefers something less chilly.
Associate Prof. Ethel McLennan chose
blue with white spots, and around her
hat a wreath of marguerites (if it is safe
to classify the artificial flowers worn by
a botanist). Mrs. Fred Rae’s white georg -
ettes were lightly patterned with black
and shrimp-pink leaves. Mrs. Harold
Wilkinson draped a feather boa round
the neck of her Nile-green caped gown.
Among Queensland visitors were Prof,
and Mrs. Murray, she in navy-blue crepe.
Dr. and Mrs. Young were there, she in
black-and-white with a feather boa. Also
in the crowd were Brig.-General and
Mrs. Coxen, Prof. Skeats and Mr. Jai
Deva, an educationist from the Pun-
jab, who came to Melbourne for the
jamboree and is prolonging his stay for
the Congress.
For the third time in 20 years evening
gowns trailed over the polished floors of
the National Gallery and Museum, the
occasion being the Science Congress’s
presidential reception and conversazione.
Guests left their wraps in a gallery de-
voted to Maori headdresses, ferocious-
looking weapons from New Caledonia,
Fijian lava-lavas and wooden deities ven-
erated by Solomon Island cannibals, and
walked on through a gallery filled with
beautiful china, valuable collections of
silver and fragile glass to exchange hand-
clasps with president Douglas Mawson
and knight David Masson, who received
with their ladies in the Buvelot Gallery.
Thence there was a general drift among
the pictures in the Stawell Gallery, where
the musically-inclined listened to a con-
cert from chairs arranged around a statue
of Aphrodite. The McArthur Gallery
was also open, and hundreds of people
who had never seen Phar Lap wended
their way among skeletons and stuffed
monsters to make the acquaintance of
the splendid chestnut, lifelike in his glass
case.
Prof. T. G. Osborn, of Sydney, brought
his wife, most distinctive with her white
hair, soft periwinkle-blue gown and spray
of carnations. Prof, and Mrs Summers
were present, she in oatmeal lace with
burgundy sleeve embellishments. Prof.
Vonwiller’s wife wore her black satin
gown gathered into scarf draperies, and
around her throat a necklet of beaten-
silver links. Dr. Gwenyth Buchanan
wore chenille velvet in tawny petunia
shades. Mrs. Ivan Maxwell swayed a
white feather fan against her strawberry
gown. An elegant violet garment with
an intricately-strapped back was worn
with great success by a slim brunette.
Mr. and Mrs. Belz were there, she with
a silver twist in her hair. Mrs. Tennant-
Kelly (Sydney), whose interests lie in an-
thropology—she contributed a paper
during the Science Congress —wore a
floral brocade tunic with a black satin
skirt. A buffet supper was served in the
luncheon-room downstairs, from which
doors opening on to the lawn were soon
discovered by smokers —lighted cigarettes
are prohibited in the National Galleries.
Afterwards an abo. film was screened in
the darkened Stawell Gallery.
A discrepancy of dress arose at “The
Unveiling of Antarctica,” Douglas Maw-
son’s presidential address at the Science
Congress. Owing to the Governor’s
presence there was a sprinkling of tails
and white ties, but a large proportion of
Wilson Hall was filled with people in
street clothes. With a unique reputation
as explorer and geologist, Douglas Maw-
son is not much of a speaker. Things
were made more difficult during the first
part of the evening by the lantern-slide
machine being particularly noisy. The
lecturer said he was confident that there
will one day be settlements upon the
Antarctic continent, which is much
larger than Australia. If polar ports are
ever included in the itinerary of summer
cruises tourists will have a large assort-
ment of strange animals and birds from
which to choose domestic pets. Tame
penguins, who look like correct little
gentlemen in evening dress, are most cap-
tivating. The sea-elephant is a curious-
looking beast. One can’t quite imagine
him flapping down Collins-street on a
leash, but stranger things than that may
happen within the next few decades.
Here is a Broothorn portrait of Mrs.
A. E. V, Richardson, who has been a
notable figure at most of the social func-
tions held in connection with the Science
Congress. Prof. Richardson is director
of the Waite Research Institute in Adel-
aide, and with knights George Julius and
David Rivett shares the executive re-
sponsibilities of the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research. Mrs. Richard-
son has accompanied her husband on four
trips round the world, and with him
has attended scientific gatherings in 23
countries. She has musical talent —plays
the piano, sings in several languages and
has for many years been a consistent
supporter of young musicians. Mrs.
Richardson gets on wonderfully well
with young people, and her tolerance and
understanding have made her a valued
friend of many youth movements. She
and the professor have one daughter,
Yvonne.
A large crowd was enlightened upon
“Volcanoes of the Pacific” in the Wilson
Hall by Dr. Patrick Marshall. Dr. Mar-
shall, who, like all Maorilanders, is in-
tensely proud of his nationality, is en-
dowed with a sense of humor. On one
occasion he was invited to New Ply-
mouth Gaol to lecture to the prisoners
on the volcanic rock which they chop up
for roads. They made the most intensely
interested audience he has ever had
(they were given an hour off road-build-
ing). Douglas Mawson and his wife, with
their daughters, were present at Dr. Mar-
shall’s lecture, the Mawson lady sporting
a fur cape and wonderful barbaric ear-
rings of diamond-shaped glass which just
brushed her shoulders. Pat and Jessica
wore their bright auburn locks in soft
rolls on the backs of their necks.
One hears comparatively little talk of
croquet, but the game has its devotees.
Overseas visitors came to Melbourne last
week specially for the Vic. Croquet
Association’s centenary celebrations. The
Lord Mayor gave a civic reception
in honor of the representatives from
Great Britain, South Africa and M.L.,
and the same evening the Vic. Associa-
tion arranged a dinner-party at the
Windsor. Cocktails were served in the
blue-room, decorated with gladioli and
clumps of leaves, and in the private
dining-room the small tables were made
particularly attractive by woven baskets
filled with cornflowers, sweet-peas, del-
phiniums and maple-leaves. The menus
were decorated with 1935 croquet players
and their quaint prototypes of 1835.
President of the Vic. Association Miss
Huntley wore flowered ninon in several
shades of blue, and Mrs. Cyril Miller
was in smoke-blue with a lame cape.
Among the guests were E. L. Ward
Petley and H. R. Poulter, both from
England, Mrs. H. P. Stratton and Mrs.
O’Meara, a pair from Maoriland, and
J. E. Witherow, W. T. McCleery and
Mrs. E. Terry, who play with the Aus-
tralian teams. One of the N.S.W. repre-
sentatives was Mrs. G. Beale, and one of
S.A.’s Miss Lloyd Roberts.
This is Mrs. Frank Lukis, whose hus-
band has recently been promoted to the
rank of Wing-Commander. Mrs. Lukis
knows all about good housekeeping, as
do the wives of all Air Force officers who
have lived on air stations, for a canteen
is a difficult place in which to do one’s
shopping ; a reel of silk forgotten in the
city may hang up a sewing job for a
week. Wing-Commander and Mrs. Lukis
have lived at Richmond (N.S.W.), at
Laverton (Vic.) and in England, and are
now stationed in Melbourne. They have
two small sons. Mrs. Lukis is inclined
towards verse, and has contributed to
The Bulletin and “Woman’s Mirror. ’
Her medico brother, Dr. Bowen Allen,
is one of the State’s best contract bridge
players. Broothorn portrait.
Last week Western District folk gravi-
tated to Warrnambool for races and the
festivities connected therewith. The
weather was perfect for the Lindsay Cup,
which was by many people turned into a
picnic, with hampers, thermos-flasks and
drinks packed on ice. One of the week’s
cocktail parties was given by Nancy
Ardlie, who, with her parents and sister,
Mrs. E. Madeley Dix, entertained at
Maretimo. Nancy Worland’s party at
Moonga started off as a treasure-hunt
and finished as a dance.
M.L.C.’s new vice-principal, Dr. G.
Wade, arrived by the Ormonde last week
from England. She is a Westralian, and
was awarded a Hackett Research Student-
ship while she was senior mistress of St.
Mary’s, West Perth. Previously she was
senior maths, mistress at M.L.C., Sydney.
Dr. Wade was abroad five years, during
which time she took her degree of Ph.D.
in London, and was recently headmistress
of Lowther College in Wales. She speci-
alises in English literature, and chose
Traherne for the subject of her thesis.
She has watched with interest the trend
in English education towards the reduc-
tion of study hours, fewer exams, and the
profitable use of leisure. She sets im-
portance upon speech-training in schools.
Dr. Wade considers that freedom is good
in moderation, but that discipline is neces-
sary to produce citizens of character.
During recent years freak schools have
sprung up all over the British Isles where
pupils can do practically as they like, and
are turned out uncontrolled harum-
scarums, incapable of earning a living.
Phyllis Ashworth, a bio-chemist, who,
before her trip abroad, was on the staff
of the Alfred, has returned after 10
months’ holiday and research work over-
seas. After an inspection of several hos-
pitals and the Lister Research Institute,
Miss Ashworth has decided that there is
just as much scope in Australia as in
London for women of her profession.
Nan Ashworth, who accompanied her
sister on the voyage, is a masseuse
who has been studying physio-therapy at
orthopaedic hospitals in England. Though
treatment for cripple cases is as up-to-
date here as it is overseas. Miss Ashworth
hopes that in years to come there will be
more after-care hospitals to assist the
permanency of cures effected by various
treatments. The educational systems in
England, which have provided children
with more facilities for gym. and have
made something interesting of physical
drill, are now starting at the root of the
trouble —for many physical disabilities
are caused through bad habit's in sitting
and standing. School-children are con-
stantly encouraged to walk correctly, and
are provided with individual desks and
chairs to suit their height.
Anyone taking a walk over the grassy
knoll in the middle of Alexandra Gardens
may get a shock if he comes suddenly
upon what looks like the Grand Canyon.
It’s a rocky fastness, at the bottom of
which flows a sluggish stream through
banks of concrete. Until a year ago the
canyon, then part of the G.H. grounds,
was an old disused quarry. Lord Stone-
haven’s children spent many a merry
hour romping on its grassy slopes. When
the Government reclaimed several acres
of vice-regal lawns and gardens it de-
cided to make a rock garden of the
woody valley, but, like the Voronoff story
of the old man who was given too much
monkey gland and became a baby, it
overdid the rocks. Staghorns and rhodo-
dendrons planted to get the full force of
the afternoon sun have died, and there’s
no garden at all. The sides are of rocks
piled one on top of the other. From the
floor of the canyon there rises a “Grecian
pillar,” on the top of which is a lamp.
On a hot day when the eyes are
dazzled by sunlight dancing on rocks one
can imagine a brown furry animal sit-
ting on the pole catching biscuits —and
it seems that it’s a bearpit one has
stumbled upon by mistake. On the south
side are one or two trees, beyond which
shrubs have been removed and the bare
soil sown with evenly-spaced barren
rocks. There are several larger boulders
whose origin is as mysterious as that of
the Easter Island images.
For a modest shilling Titania’s Palace
may be seen at Ball and Welch’s. Lord
and Lady Huntingfield came up from
Frankston for the opening ceremony.
Wherever the Palace is shown the entire
profits of the exhibitions go to the cause
of that country’s crippled children.
In June, 1933, there was a B.M.A.
conference in Ireland in connection with
which a visit was arranged for some of
the doctors to an orthopaedic hospital in
Wicklow. Among the medicoes was
Dr. Jean Macnamara, of Melbourne. She
was struck by the modern and expensive
equipment of the hospital, and upon in-
quiry learned that it had been made
possible by the exhibitions of Titania’s
Palace. It was a coincidence that on the
same afternoon she met Lady Beatrix
Wilkinson, who was visiting her cousin,
the Earl of Wicklow. On her return to
England, Dr. Macnamara met Sir Nevile
Wilkinson and went to Exeter to see the
Palace. Sir Nevile and Lady Beatrix had
often thought of bringing the Palace to
Australia, but they had made no plans;
this far-away country was quite un-
known to them. Their meeting with
an enthusiastic Australian orthopaedic
specialist had a lot to do with their
present visit. Dr. Macnamara was mar-
ried a few months ago to Dr. Ivan
Connor.
The Earl of Wicklow is at present in
Melbourne. He is travelling among
Queen Titania’s retinue.

BY APPOINTMENT TO H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES
was no worse than usual, and old-stagers
declared that Sydney had never before
enjoyed such a Wagnerian feast.
But to the critic who is not an
idolater “Tristan” seems an awful lot
of cry about a very small quantity
of wool. Its long-sustained surgings
of passion and emotion are exhausting
to the mind of the listener as well as to
the violently exercised vocal chords of
the singers. Wagner himself seems to
have perceived, towards the end of the
last act, that he had piled Pelion on
° ssa beyond the bounds of sanity, so
Tristan had to lose the last remnants of
his reason and lie babbling in delirium
before the volcano of erotic yearnings
could erupt its final splutters of white-
hot lava.
Perhaps one of the reasons why Jews
are so unpopular in patriotic German
circles is that Max Nordau so unspar-
ingly diagnosed the elements of degen-
eracy and mental aberration in the Wag-
nerian scores. Those elements are more
pronounced in “Tristan” than in any
other of his operas. Such story as there
is in “Tristan” is musically expressed
quite adequately in the prelude to the
first act, admittedly one of the finest
achievements in orchestral literature. The
rest is a more or less morbid embroidery,
reiteration and progressive accentuation
of the initial statement, insufficiently
relieved by contrasting themes.
* * *
The Fuller co. made a very much better
job of its first Sydney production of “II
Trovatore” than it did of “Rigoletto.”
With whatever feelings of condescension
the performance was commenced, the
singers and orchestra by the end of the
first act had caught fire both from Verdi
and a genuinely appreciative audience,
and the rest of the opera went with
irresistible swing and vigor. Thea
Philips, as Leonora, sang her first aria
coldly and without color, but by
the time the “Miserere” and the prison
scene came along she was making full
play with the emotions. Ben Williams’s
Manrico was a likeable fellow, and
Madame Brunskill made a really superb
Azucena. Sydney de Vries was well
suited, too, as the Count di Luna, and
chorus and orchestra have never done
better while in Sydney.
•S * *
Frank Neil’s excellent judgment of
form in girls makes “Laughter Zone,”
his latest revue at Melb. Tivoli, a bright
entertainment. It is the ballets and
vaudeville acts that make the show ; the
comedy is weak. The two Chinese boys
have added a few more feats to their
acrobatic turn. Michel and Arnova give
a series of striking whirlwind dances,
occasionally with the assistance of the
gaily caparisoned ballet. Vaughen hits
wooden slats with musical results, and
there is an effective finale to the first
part, introducing ditties popularised by
Albert Chevalier,
The 92 portraits submitted for the
1934 Archibald Prize are a vastly im-
pressive lot —generals in full regalia;
law lords in all the glory of horsehair
and silk ; ladies in satins; captains of in-
dustry in their best tailorings; surgeons
in operating vestments. Elbowing his
way through the levee came an out-of-
work artist in a battered old hat and a
seedy overcoat, struck an attitude of
jaunty defiance to a hard world—and
won the prize! Archibald would have
chuckled over that. It proves his pet
adage: Every man has. one story he can
tell better than anyone else can.
H. A. Hanke paints H. A. Hanke,
saving pennies out of the dole to pay for
paint and canvas, and his work has a
depth and sincerity, as well as a vigor,
that refuse to put themselves in the
frames of hundred-guinea commissions.
There were cleverer painters than Hanke
after the prize. Mclnnes’s picture of
William Rowell is a masterpiece of slick
competency; Buckmaster’s Miss Hamil-
ton is a piece of bravura technique that
would be given a good place anywhere
in the world. Meldrum and his disciple
Colahan apply their exclusive formula
with more or less happy results. But
Hanke’s battered old hat and the eyes
under it are inescapable.
The Wynne prize show at the Sydney
National Gallery is “Hamlet” without
the prince—Elioth Gruner’s winning
painting isn’t there. There’s some nice
work among the 31 entries, but Gainer's
victory must have been more or less
bloodless.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
WESTRALIA.
Lady Campion boarded the Oronsay
for her return to England after a round
of farewell functions. The Women’s
Service Guild’s was one of the first affairs,
when the members flocked to their head-
quarters, which were a blaze of blue
hydrangeas, agapanthus and red roses.
Presentation carnations nestled in the
guest of honor’s lap as she sipped tea
and listened to ditties by Rose Atkinson
and Mrs. Spencer Cooke. Mr. John
Nicholson gathered Red Cross members
at Parliament House, where tea was
poured in the President’s room through
the courtesy of knight John Kirwan. Mrs.
Griffiths-Bowen parked her navy georg-
ettes and navy sisal straw at the Palace
Hotel, and handed Lady Campion a
bouquet of gold roses which harmonised
with her brown-and-white foulard and
wheat-trimmed brown straw. The de-
parting one returned hospitality and said
farewells at a couple of tea-parties at
the Karrakatta Club.
The Russian Ballet’s opening night in
Perth drew one of the best-dressed audi-
ences seen in His Majesty’s for some
time. Mrs. Max Rutter’s brilliant tiara
scintillated near the orchestra, with Mrs.
Le Faye’s white fur coat a seat or two
back; Mrs. Frank Lefroy’s Lido-blue
cape swung next Mrs. Langlois Lefroy’s
sombre blacks ; medicoes McKellar Hall,
Atlee Hunt and Gilbert Troup brought
along their better-halves; Mrs. Fred
Heron’s flame silks were near the front;
Joy Mitchell’s silver lame glittered in the
circle; and Mrs. Fred Hammond’s black
georgettes were glimpsed in a box.
Molly Manning’s twoscore guests
were given a variety of entertainment at
an afternoon and evening shivoo. Tennis
at her Cottesloe home started proceed-
ings, with the hostess in cool white
linen, followed by a cruise on the racing
yacht Scud and a swim for those who
felt like it. High tea preceded the drag-
ging for prawns, and the cooking thereof
and music and munching made the revel-
lers reluctant to leave the Mosman Bay
beach.
The Pingelly Rep. Soc.’s presentation
of “The Sport of Kings” lured crowds
from the district and a goodly gathering
from the city to the local hall. J. A.
Dodds kept a skilful eye on the produc-
tion, and Tony Turner made a hit as
Amos Purdie. After supper in the green-
room there was dancing in the hall.
President Sewell’s lady wound a cloak
over her biscuit crepes ; Mrs. Johnson’s
silks were flower - patterned; Molly
Taylor swung a length of royal blue
pebble crepe; Mrs. Kemmis swept the
ground with beige lace, and Bea Bos-
tock shook fine killings on her black
marocains.
C.W.A. members were entertained by
the Metropolitan Branch with a basket
tea. President Mrs. T. C. Wilson wel-
comed the guests in the Government
Gardens. Business was executed and
chatter exchanged under the shady trees :
then there was tea at the new resthouse
near by.
Cecily and Owen Atkinson put on a
dance at their Mount-street home for a
horde of young things. Festoons and
colored lights, swinging above the veran-
dahs, were reflected on the shining white
taffeta girding the young hostess, who
finished off her gown with rosebud trim-
ming. Daphne Vincent was there, and
Bettys Unmack, Cooke and Hodgkinson.
Margaret Lee Steere, Josephine Dobson,
Molly Newbury, Jean Forrest and Nancy
Meares were some of the others.
Claremont’s Bettie Bolton is the new-
est member of the ring brigade. The
donor is Keith Gibson, only son of
Mayor Gibson, of Fremantle, and Mrs.
Gibson.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The international tennis-players were
a day late, and their entertainment had
to be crammed into a very limited time.
At the civic welcome the reception-room
of the Lady Mayoress was so crowded
that one lady had the back of her lace
coat decorated with two ham sandwiches
and a cream puff which she had un-
knowingly removed from one of the
small tables. Mrs. Cain has quite recov-
ered, and was able to take her place and
receive the guests with her husband. She
wore black marocain with a smart little
applique coat. Premier Butler’s wife
chose a black-and-white effect. Dorothy
Round was frocked in white crepe de
Chine, patterned in red and green, and
her white hat was banded with red
ribbon.
The French players were invited to
morning tea at the South Australian by
the Alliance Fran?aise. The lounge was
ablaze with scarlet and yellow gladioli
and dahlias when the president (Mr. W.
W. Goodhart), the vice-president (Mrs.
H. S. Hudd) and the secretary (Mrs.
Ernest Puddy) welcomed Brugnon and
Boussus. After tea had been served
the president made a brief speech, and
M. Brugnon responded. Mrs. Hudd was
frocked in duck-egg blue crepe de Chine
and a white hat, Mrs. Puddy chose white
flowered chiffon and a wide-brimmed
black hat, and Madame Wait was in
black marocain with a small black hat.
The dinner-dance given by the Lawn
Tennis Association at the Richmond was
a bright affair. Mrs, H. J. Lipman and
Clem Chinner organised the party, and
about 150 were present. Dorothy Round,
in a soft, clinging black lace frock with
cherry velvet waistbelt, looked very dif-
ferent from the Amazon of the courts.
Mrs. Lipman’s Madonna-blue georgette
was scattered with tiny diamente, and a
band of diamente trimming outlined the
backless bodice. Mrs. Dudley chose a
black toilette with a touch of white on
the bodice. Mrs. Alec Turnbull was
wearing her wedding frock of white satin
cut on princess lines. Mrs. Darcy Cowan
sported delphinium-blue marocain. Mrs.
Ross Sawers was in black lace, with a
cape of the same trimmed with beige fur,
and Mrs. R. V. Thomas looked smart
in a flame georgette.
About 40 young friends of Betty
Taylor gave her a surprise party at her
home. North Adelaide, on her 21st birth-
day. Mrs. A. L. Taylor, Betty’s cousin
Helen Taylor and Christine Tipping en-
gineered the friendly plot. Dancing was
in the music-room, decorated with mixed
flowers, and supper was served in the
dining-room.
TASMANIA.
Mrs. John Downie gave a jolly dance
at the Imperial for a crowd of bright
young things. The hostess wore a long
trailing dress of black lace. A private
room upstairs held the supper-tables,
decked with pink flowers and pink-
shaded candles.
The Strawberry Feast at Ferntree, a
red-letter day in the hamlet’s calendar,
was held in pouring rain, but the attend-
ance was good, and even ice-cream had
a good sale. Visitors who ran up from
town included Mungo MacCallum and his
lady, the Frank Gunnows, the two Miss
Iceleys and the Miss Longs —the usual
N.S.W. summer contingent.
Trissie Seal invited a throng of friends
to the Queen Mary Club to say good-bye
to her sister Mrs. F. Ainslie Wood, who
has been in the Speck on holiday, on the
eve of her return to Adelaide. Pink and
blue cornflowers made tea-table decora-
tions. The hostess sported a green and
black floral frock and hat with pale roses,
Mrs Wood looked smart in a navy
tailored suit.
The Joseph Pearsons farewelled the
Duncan Browns (Ceylon) at a late-after-
noon party at their home in Sandy Bay.
Mrs. W. W. Giblin was also hostess to
the visitors. They sailed by the Maloja,
having enjoyed their stay immensely.
Joan Manton, one of the Ken Shoo-
bridge twins, Glenora, and F. W. Grevis-
James, of Mt. Aitken, Sunbury, and Mal-
vern, Vic., announce their engagement.
Mrs. Ralph Worrall (Sydney) blew in
on the Maloja on her way to London,
and was lunched and otherwise inter-
tained by Hobart friends during her
brief stay.


SUNDRY
SHOWS
ẃ
The Mob
and Art
In “An Old Art
Goes By” (R.P.
2/1/’35) J. Kent-
well says that
Shakspeare’s
theatre and that
of Wycherley and Congreve were com-
parable to the cinema of to-day:
The mob —that is, the people for whom
Shakspeare wrote and Wycherley and
Congreve penned their wittiest lines —
prefers nowadays to sit in comfort and
enjoy a fare different from that which
believers in the Art of the Theatre would
thrust before it.
But as “J.K.’s” facts are amiss so his
conclusions are far-fetched. Shakspeare’s
stage was not as popular as all that.
The Elizabethan-Jacobean theatre was
intellectual and fashionable ; above all,
intellectual. It had but lately emerged
from under the wing of the Church,
which had encouraged amateur produc-
tions of “Mysteries” and “Moralities”
with comic interludes. The first theatre
in London was a perilous venture, and
had to be erected outside the walls by
a friend of Shakspeare, Burbage the
elder, a builder who was himself an ama-
teur actor.
In Shakspeare’s London there were
never more than two or three profes-
sional dramatic companies running simul-
taneously. Their theatres were not mob
theatres. The mob of those days was
satisfied with bull-baiting, cock-fighting
and thrilling entertainments of the kind.
The wights who scorned these bouts
went to the clownish shows in the yards
of taverns —on a par with the vaudeville
of our times.
Women were not admitted to theatres
either as actresses or audiences. On
special occasions the actors gave per-
formances at Court; but, as a rule, the
Court preferred Masques and suchlike
artificiality. Poets were not much
esteemed, and were poorly paid, receiv-
ing only a. few pounds for a dramatic
masterpiece.
Will Shakspeare and 10 other vaga-
bond players were (mce dressed up as
Gentlemen of the Bedchamber to grace
the welcome extended to a foreign Am-
bassador by James I.; but James was of
Scotland—a canny body—so the poor
devils were not paid for the privilege of
displaying themselves as flunkies.
But the actors who had shares in “A
Cry of Players” were generally better off
than the poets, because they held the
licenses of the bear-baiting and cock-
fighting shows (“Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France?”), and the
bulk of their money was derived from
these more popular amusements. The
wealthiest actor of all, Alleyne, was
Keeper of the King’s Wild Beasts and
Master of the Royal Bear Garden.
Alleyne had ever a good eye for stock
—he married three heiresses.
After the Restoration the theatre
proper continued to be the resort of the
fashionables and the intellectuals —especi-
ally the fashionables. At this time there
were only two companies and two
theatres in London: “The King’s Ser-
vants” at Drury Lane and “The Duke’s
Company” at Lincoln’s Inn Fields. About
10 of the King’s company were on his
Majesty’s household establishment, and
were styled “the Lord Chamberlain
Gentlemen of the Grand Chamber.”
Then for about 11 years these two
companies united, for the whole of
London could support only one theatre.
In 1695 a theatre was reopened in Lin-
coln’s Inn Fields with Congreve’s “Love
for Love,” and once again London had
two theatres, both centres of fashion.
As for the cinema, it is not theatre ;
nor is it called theatre anywhere but in
these latitudes. Cinema has taken the
place of circus, and is mainly the resort
"Derelict," by Syd Long; one of many finethings exhibiled at the
painter-Etchers' show at Sydney Education Buildings.
of women and children who see history
and human nature falsified to suit the
taste of those who have no interest what-
ever in either art or literature. To com-
pare the prodigious theatre of Shakspeare,
with its piercing insight, its divinations
into character in action, and the witty,
subtle Wycherley and Congreve stage
with the cinema of to-day is merely cut-
ting capers and japing at reality.
“J.K.” adds:
The importance of any form of enter-
tainment in a community lies in the
measure of support given by the amuse-
ment-seeking public.
If that is so, Shakspeare’s theatre was
of little importance. The mob never has
supported the best in any art; neither in
Shakspeare’s or Congreve’s day nor any-
body’s day. Mob is always mob. It
never changes. This may be unfortunate
for the artist.

Art and the
Copyist
The case of
the Sydney artist
who is alleged to
have copied Sep-
tim u s Power’s
“On the Moor”
in the Melbourne National Gallery and
then submitted it as his own work to
an American academy raises an aesthetic
problem of the first importance. Ac-
cording to my understanding of it,
which, incidentally, is shared by Profes-
sor Anderson, professor of Philosophy
in the Sydney University, and by such
painters as Titian, Velasquez, Rem-
brandt and Constable, if the copy of
Power’s picture was a good copy, then
it was a greater work of art than the
original. This statement may be difficult
to swallow, so I will try to explain.
A painting is the record of the artist’s
visual impression. In Power’s case it
is of a hypothetical dog, woman and
man reposing on a hilltop. There is
plenty of evidence to show that Power
dealt very ineffectively with his visual
impression. This impression must have
been of certain sensations of color, tone
and form which reached the artist’s eye
in an invariable order. That is to say,
the most important differences of light
and dark must have reached it before
those of slighter importance. There are
no exceptions to this law in nature.
Power, however, is an academically
trained artist. He has been taught cer-
tain quite arbitrary rules of drawing,
composition and so forth. Therefore,
before he has translated his original im-
pression into marks on his canvas, he
has allowed himself to be influenced by
all sorts of considerations which have
nothing to do with the impression.
The result is a picture which, while it
fulfils the rules of the academies and
pleases people who have been condi-
tioned, like him, by these rules and who
also like dogs, pretty girls and good-
looking young men, has very little rela-
tion to the original subject-matter.
Instead of the true snap and sparkle
of real light, there will be a sophisticated
studio rendering of it.
Now, if another painter comes along
and copies the Power he is confronted
with exactly the same problem as con-
fronted Rembrandt, Corot and Raeburn
in their pictures. He is, in short, con-
cerned with defining correctly certain
visual impressions of color of varying
tones and proportions. The fact that
nature, unlike the Power canvas, is not
a flat surface makes no difference, ex-
cept to make the problem somewhat less
complicated. If the copyist solves his
problem he will have produced a rela-
lively true copy, and to that extent has
painted a work of art, just as much as
if he painted a bowl of roses. The fact
that the original painting may have been
a bad painting again makes no difference,
except to make the copy a better work
of art, i.e., a greater display of know-
ledge of the real problem of the painter
than the original.
The morality of copying a picture and
then exhibiting it as one’s own, of course,
admits of no discussion. Power has a
vested interest in the knowledge of de-
sign, composition and so forth on which
he bases his reputation. If the public
and the art authorities place the same
value on it, another painter has no more
right to filch it from the owner than
he has to purloin his trousers. The
aesthetic aspect, however, belongs to
quite another category, and if it were
understood it would lead to an enor-
mous improvement in the honesty and
beauty of our art collections, in which
impudent lies masquerade as truth and
pretentiousness as genius to a degree that
would be inconceivable in any other
science.

Filmer
Amateur film-
ists have a society
in Sydney with a
membership of
about 60, and
they meet peri-
odically in the theatrette of a friendly
movie corporation and show their
achievements. Some of them have
achieved fame in the great U.S.A.,
J. A. Sherlock, for example. Up
in Kodak’s projecting-room, a sort of
holy of holies to which, ordinarily, lay-
men as regards photography are never
allowed to penetrate, two of his best
works were recently given a spin for the
benefit of some art critics.
First was entitled “Rambles in Syd-
ney.” The film gives a really excel-
lent impression of the city. Commenc-
ing in early morning, great activity at
the municipal markets and people troop-
ing to work from all the city railway
stations, it works through the hours, giv-
ing characteristic glimpses of the streets
and the best-known buildings under sun-
shine ; then under one of those sloshing
cloudbursts that make Sydneyites mutter
vindictively “Sunny New South Wales!”
Martin-place, the Bridge, the ferries, the
impressive panorama of and from Dar-
ling Harbor. Then comes night, and
the Bridge is a bow of light; the harbor
becomes a complicated maze of stars,
and the streets flaunt their sky signs and
neon lights, reflected in the wet, wet
streets. And in all these hundreds of
glimpses of scenes filled with bustling
crowds not a soul shows a sign of
camera-consciousness. They were cut
off at the meter, as it were, as soon as
they wokp up to the fact that they were
being photographed.
The effort to express the city passes
across the screen in about 20 minutes —
perhaps less —and it is so well done that
it looks easy. But it took five months
of keen, discriminating, clever photo-
graphy to get it together all in apple-
pie order.
Film 2 was a series of illustrations
for Tennyson’s “Brook,” the poem
shown on the screen, stanza by stanza,
and the varying phases of the stream
faithfully represented—well, not quite
faithfully, for the job was done in the
N. S. Wales countryside, and wild swans
(telephotographic lens here) had to re-
present the “coot and hern.” But the
rest of it is there, as it is in the book —
the bickering down
the valley, the trick-
ling amid cress, the
passing of “thirty
hills, a little town
and half a hundred
bridges.” This film
won a prize (50
dollars) in a com-
petition conducted
by the American
Amateur Cinemato-
graphic Society, and
Sherlock, who
doesn’t believe in
cash - amateurs,
promptly turned the
money over to a
deserving charity.
Tennyson would
have liked those
illustrations, and the
art critics, for once
in a way, had no
fault to find with
them. You can’t
quarrel with verit-
able nature, even in
monochrome. And
it certainly seems a
more intellectual and
worthy occupation
to make moving
pictures than to sit and look at them—
they being what they be.

Melb. National
Gallery students’
exhibition is now
open—that is to
say, the public
can get into the
gallery where the pictures and drawings
are hung, if they know how. The draw-
ings from casts and from life are excel-
lent—the best of them —as they always
are. The still-life paintings are inferior,
and the life-class paintings range from
zero to boiling point. The weakness of
the whole exhibition is that no scope
whatever is offered to the student of
imagination. It is only in those years
when the travelling scholarship is
awarded that the ability of a boy or girl
in composition is given an opportunity to
reveal itself. All through its history
Melb. National Gallery has been turning
out good technicians with insufficient
imagination.
A banking house’s staff magazine may
not seem a very promising place in which
to look for Art, but the December
number of “Bank Notes,” issued by the
Commonwealth Bank staff, is chock-full
of it. The idea that a camera can’t pro-
duce a picture that measures up to Art
standards died hard, but it is dead. So it
is with joy that one finds the four-weekly
comparative statement of the bank’s
liabilities and assets illustrated by a G. S.
Currey study of a foam-crested wave ;
chairman Reading’s good wishes to the
personnel footed by a “pastoral sym-
phony” from the same camera ; trade re-
view enlivened by impressions in old
and new modes worked out with sunlight
and chemicals by Henri Mullard and
Max Dupain, with addendums by Kauff-
man, Cotton, Lomax, Berney and Wray.
These and many others make it evident
that here has been found the long-sought
nexus between Art and Finance.

Humor Story Entry:—
THE PHARLAP PCMRLIN
By HENRY G. LAMOND.
ERNIE spent his old age growing cab-
bages. That was his business. His
hobby was pumpkins. One corner
of his plot was fenced off for the pur-
pose, and there Ernie spent' all his avail-
able minutes and money. He mixed soils
and manures ; he cross-fertilised strains ;
he bought chemicals; he planted and
pruned, worked and weeded, and, when-
ever I saw him, he was in doubt, debt
and dungarees.
A bit at a time, and as the old man’s
confidence in me grew, he told me his
story. As there is no need to say if, I
make a point of mentioning it: he was
born of poor but honest parents, and all
that sort of thing, and he came of a
strain which had the earth firmly planted
in its blood—he related with pride how
one of his early ancestors had been head
gardener to the Artichoke of Jerusalem
and how, in a fit of pique, he had mar-
ried Contrary Mary.
With such breeding behind him Ernie
had to be a gardener. He was! His
breath always smelt of onions. As a
youngster, as he related it to me, he had
heard of the pumpkin which grew so
fast that it wore its fruit off dragging
them along the ground.
That fired his imagina-
tion ; became an obses-
sion with him. He
searched for it; he
tried to breed it; he
bought chemicals and
manures; he tried
planting seeds at the
full of the moon and at
low tide; and then,
covered in dirt and
filled with disgust, he gave the game best.
He mixed together all his stuff regardless
of quantity ; he threw it out in a heap
and tossed all his seeds into it.
“And then you fluked what you
sought?” I asked.
“You’ve been reading the story books,”
Ernie reproved me. “They always do
that in stories. I must be. a story: I did
it too. One pumpkin-seed of the hun-
dreds I threw out was the lucky marble.
It hit a patch of just the conditions it
wanted. It sprouted. It grew. While I
"Galloping easy.”
watched it it sped through the fence,
carrying a panel with it, and it shot across
country. I won’t tell you how I chased
it; how I tried to head it off and turn it
for home, or anything of that sort. Ten
minutes after it had hatched, and when
the head of it was going over that far
hill, one male flower was knocked off as
it rushed through the gap in the fence.
((THOUGH I was dazed, I hadn’t done
* me block. I picked up that male
and I inoculated with it the only three
female flowers that were blooming at the
time —they were on a Beaudesert Blue,
which is one of the hardiest pumpkins
we have.
“I watched those flowers. I’ve
never been a father, so I don’t
know what it is to have the
nurse tell me it’s a boy and the
missus is doing well. I do know, though
what it is to be the foster-father of trip-
lets and the mother going strong: those
three flowers each bore, and the old Blue
carried on nobly!
“I’ll not worry you with details of how
I reared ’em and how, when the time
came to cut ’em, I performed a surgical
operation that would
have been the envy of
any specialist. I put
them triplets in a cellar,
with light, heat and
moisture just right, and
I waited me time.
“At last it was pump-
kin-planting time again.
I was trembling with
nervousness when I
opened one of me
beauties and took the seeds from her.
Would they have inherited the pace of
their sire? That was the big question. I
took ’em out to the bed I’d prepared—a
bed that was almost a cot in its dainty
beauty. I took one seed in me fingers
and I pushed him home.
<*OANG! Just like that! I was
** knocked kicking. I rolled over a
couple of times and picked meself up to
see what had knocked me. It was that
pumpkin.
“Like Pardon, the son of Reprieve, it
had inherited the mettle of its dam and
the temper of its sire—it got the pace
from one and the stamina from the old
Beaudesert Blue. As soon as I’d put that
seed in the ground, and before I’d had
time to step clear, the thing had shot up
under me, sent me tossing, and, by the
time I’d rubbed me eyes clear of dust,
the head of the vine was disappearing
over the hill!
“I’d solved the secret, right enough.
The next problem was how to control it.
I wanted to breed from those pumpkin
Phar Laps so’s I’d have the speediest
pumpkins in the world. This super-
strain that I’d bred didn’t only go fast
enough to wear its fruit off—it paced it
so quick that a galloping horse couldn’t
stay with the flowers.
“After I’d learnt to stand clear when
I planted the seeds I made a few more
experiments. With some stubs and a bit
of tunnelling I steered the young vine so
it must run over the stripped chassis of
an old Ford car. I reckoned, with luck,
that would catch in the vine and hold
the pumpkin clear of the ground.
“The first one ran the car over a creek,
up a tree, through some rocks and
smashed it to pieces. The hundredth vine
I grew was a success. It got in the car
as natural as a chorus girl, lounged back
like a barmaid, waved me good-bye and
disappeared over the hill.
“Three weeks later I found the car.
Its axles were burnt out; its bearings
were seized ; its wheels were worn down
to the hubs ; it was only a relic of what
I widdlesome Twilight.
it might have been, with a dry spray of
vine hanging over one of its ears.
“Before I cut the second pumpkin and
took the seeds from her I had a new idea
and preparations. I’d built a circular
concrete tank. So long as the thing didn’t
run itself giddy it couldn’t get out of that,
and I’d have him. I took a couple of
seeds with me, climbed down into the
tank, and I planted ’em.
“By this time, of course, I was used
to stepping away when the seeds shot.
I watched those seeds sprout and I did a
bit of a wicked grin as I saw the blur
of the vine racing round and round the
walls.
“That was where I nearly made the
greatest mistake of my life! I was in
that tank! Three times when I tried to
get out the head of the vine knocked me
off the walls ; once it rolled me till the
clothes were nearly stripped off me ; then
the heat generated by the friction started
to tell. I was being cremated alive!
“I just got out in time. Though me
hands were blistered and me knees were
scorched I’d only just got free when the
whole tank burst into flame!
<<MEXT day there was one bit of
* * green of what had been a vine left
in that tank. And feeding at it, licking
his chops and chewing steadily, was a
snail!
“I dropped me fox-terrier Ponto in to
kill that snail. He set sail after it. Ponto’s
legs were going like the blurred spokes
of a revolving wheel; his yaps were com-
ing short and sharp, and that snail was
just dawdling along, galloping easy, hold-
ing about three lengths’ lead of Ponto
without exerting himself.
“Waved me good-bye”
“I took a tumble to that lot: by eat-
ing the pumpkin the snail had developed
the pace of Phar Lap! If a snail could
do that, what would another animal get
from it? I decided to test that lot.
“Using a bit of the pumpkin itself as

in the tank. I went round and had a
yarn with Knocker White —he always had
a dog or two in training and, being a
sport, he was usually interested in a horse.
“Knocker came and brought Twiddle-

put her in with the rat. And she had
less chance of catching it than what
Ponto had with the snail!
“Knocker had his big idea then: he
reckoned that, if we could feed the rat
to the dogs, we’d hand on the pace to

would do a meat-eater much good ; but
being fed to them that way it was worth
trying.
“I thought so, too,

couldn’t. Knocker got his gun to shoot

this scientific method
YOU must know how to keep teeth
brilliant, dazzling. If you don’t, you
can’t expect to attract men by your smile.
Now there is a special way to make teeth
exquisitely lovely. It acts by removing a
stubborn, ugly coating that forms on teeth.
This coating, called film, is primarily re-
sponsible for dull, unsightly teeth. You
can feel film with your tongue. It forms
constantly—rapidly.
This film absorbs the stains from food
—the ugly stains from smoking. In film
are the acid-producing germs that cause
decay...glued by film to teeth, where they
attack enamel and destroy the part beneath.
Thus, removing film accomplishes two
things—keeps teeth gleaming bright and
helps prevent dreaded tooth decay.
The approved way to remove film is with

UME and Knocker
1»* sat down to have
a conference. Here
was a fortune knocking
at our doors, begging
of us to open and let it
in, and we didn’t know
how to do it. I even
planted another seed
in the tank to let
Knocker see how it
worked.
“That vine shot
round, picked up the
rat, tossed him in the
air, threw him out and
killed him.
“Knocker picked up
the body and fed it
to Twilight. She ate it.
We tried her out after
the feed. Her pace was
the same as before.
“Me and Knocker
held another confer-
ence. Him, being a
bit of a scientist
through handling dope,
gave his ideas on the
subject :
“‘Either the
strength’s diluted through going through
too many bodies or else it’s a
transient that has to be used hot. I’ll
tell you how we’ll work that lot,
Ernie,’ says he. ‘l’ve got old Nobba
Kerry down in me stables. Nobba was a
good ’un once. We might get a race out
of him yet. We’ll try him with this
pumpkin dope. If it acts we’ll nominate
him for the Morestone Cup. We’ll train
him, work him up, and, as he’ll be at a
long price on that good betting race,
we’ll make a pot out of it. I’ve been
keepin’ Blinker Davis all through his dis-
qualification. There’s no better boy on
a horse in Australia than Blinker. The
whole thing fits in like a jigsaw puzzle.
What about it?’
“Without going into details I’ll tell you
that we tried old Nobba. Less than
half a pint of mashed pumpkin put him
in a class that could give Phar Lap
weigm.
“Lay down and died."
«W E nom i nate d Nobba, and we backed
*» him. We kept on backing him.
We worked him down from fifty to one
to even money. We kept on working
that pumpkin into him. The last feed
he had on the morning of the race was
the last of the last pumpkin. The thing
was a moral cert. Our money was as
good as home. We never worked him
full out because there was never any
need to try him at his top. At half-
pace he could have won the Melbourne
Cup carrying ten stone seven and a bit.
“Still, though me fortune was as good
as made, I kept a small reserve: I put
the last two seeds of the last pumpkin
in my pocket in case I had to start off
afresh again.
“You know the course of the More-
stone Cup? You know how they start
at the top of the straight, race past the
stands, go round once and finish?
“Old Nobba was there as skittish as a
colt. He took his place at the barrier,
while I held me breath and those two
pumpkin-seeds. Knocker was down in
the ring getting on his last few bob, and
him and me was millionaires in the
making.
“ ‘They’re off! ’ the crowd shouted.
“I had a look. They were off right
enough. And so was Nobba Kerry! He
was right off the track. He wasn’t in
sight anywhere. As the field streamed
past the stands me and Knocker was
holding hands and breaths and looking
for him. He was nowhere! So far as I
could make out on the spur of the
moment that pumpkin had just fizzed up
inside him and blown him to bits—
Old Nobba.
either that or worn
him away to nothing
with its racing.
UT HE race went on.
* The field gal-
loped up the side,
along the back, swung
round and was just at
the turn of the straight.
And then suddenly
Nobba came into view!
He was opposite the
Leger stand, leading
the field by half the
straight and going for
the winning post.
“I thought quick. I
solved it lively. We’d
given old Nobba too
big a feed of pumpkin,
and it had made him
so fast he had to go
ninety-five times round
the course before
Blinker could steady
him down slow enough
for people to see him!
And when he did
steady him down the
pumpkin had all died
in him!
“It was a good race. Old Nobba was
settled. He was rolling in his stride
and floundering. Blinker hadn’t been
disqualified many times in vain: he
knew enough to close in at the right
time and block a run. As it was, he
just got home by no more than half a
length.
“Then the roar rose: ‘Ned Kelly! ’
‘Rub him out!’ A heap more that I like
to forget, and then a bit added.
“The protest bell rang. The inquiry
flag went up. Knocker was down among
a crowd of them, arguing, waving his
arms and talking. I slipped one of
those pumpkin-seeds into my mouth and
chewed hard. I didn’t know when I
mightn’t need it's magic properties.
Knocker waved his arm towards me and
said something which started the crowd.
I ate the other seed.
“Just when I was beginning to feel the
need and influence of them seeds another
bell rang and a ‘Disqualified—Short
Weight’ notice went up. The mob left
me, and Knocker and I got together. I
was feeling all springy and lively, and 1
could have carried Knocker and run
away from the crowd if they wanted
trouble.
“We went in to find out the cause of
this short weight. We knew Blinker had
weighed out right. We knew he was
too old a bird to be caught napping.
ND then we had a look at him and
<*»• realised what had happened: the
reason of him being seven pounds short.
His hair had been blown off by the pace
he’d been going; his clothes ' were
stripped from him ; his contour had been
altered—either the force of the blow or
the friction of the air had worn all the
sharp edges off him and stripped him
down to the bone!
“The race was lost; our money had
gone; the last of the seeds had been
eaten. We didn’t have enough to buy
ourselves a drink or a ride home.
Nobba was played out, and just natu-
rally lay down and died; Blinker bor-
rowed an overcoat and sneaked home
a back way; Knocker and me had no-
thing left —only our experience.
“Still, I’m
exp eriment-
in g ye t,”
Ernie con-
cluded
brightly. “I
think I’ve got
it again this
time. If only
I had the
mo qey to
buy material
I’d be sure
of sue cess.
How about
floating a
company to

Weak Kidneys
STABBING PAINS IN THE BACK, LUMBAGO
You are justified in regarding
Kidney Trouble as a serious com-
plaint, but you should not let it
make you miserable or spoil your
life. Excepting in very rare cases,
Kidney Trouble yields quickly to
treatment with De Witt’s Pills, and
thus the remedy is within your
easy reach.
Chemists everywhere sell De
Witt’s Pills, and it is a wise plan to
keep a box handy
in the house so that
you can take one or
two the moment you
recognise symptoms
of kidney trouble.
You may awaken with a nasty
taste in your mouth; your tongue
may be coated, your breath foul.
There may be puffiness under your
eyes. Your ankles or your feet may
swell and there may be pain in your
back or your hips or your shoulders.
These are signs by which you may
know that all is not well with your
kidneys. They are allowing uric
acid to escape in dangerous quan-
tities to poison your blood and
torture your body, but De Witt’s
Pills will quickly put you right,
TAKE TWO TO-NIGHT
Take two of DeWitt’s Pills to-night
and in the morning you will see, feel
and know for certain that they are
doing you good.
because they contain ingredients
which act directly upon the kidneys.
They make the kidneys healthy and
active, and so rid your system of
harmful uric acid.
Nature intended that your kidneys should
act as filters to keep your system pure and free
from poisonous waste matters. By taking
De Witt’s Pills you give weak or congested
kidneys just the natural assistance they need,
and the alarming symptoms quickly disappear.
Thus you see that the treatment of kidney
trouble is quite simple.
There is no need for alarm
and no reason why the
ailment should get the
upper hand and make a
slave of you. The only
thing to remember is that
prompt treatment saves
much suffering and prevents the ailment
getting a firm hold on your system. That
is why you should get De Witt’s Pills quickly.
The cost is trifling, and a remedy that has
already relieved thousands cannot fail to do
you good. Don’t stop to think it over. Kidney
trouble gets rapidly worse. Buy a box to-day,
price 3/6, or more economical size, 6/6.
Watch for such symptoms as puffiness
under the eyes, heaviness of the limbs, swollen
feet or ankles, foul breath, scalding pains,
gravel or stone. These symptoms usually
precede attacks of Rheumatism, Backache,
Lumbago, Sciatica or serious Kidney Trouble,
and much suffering and expense may be saved
by quickly getting a box of De Witt’s Pills
from the chemist and taking them as directed.

Study in Hysteria:—
NIGHTMARE
By E.W. WATERMAN
"God, I can't stand it!'
Hysteria grips her. “I hatt
him, loathe him! I never
married this /”
44|’ J E’S got to stop it. Got to” .. .
Hands pressed to ears, Cath-
erine tries to shut out that mad-
dening, rhythmic, ceaseless breathing.
Tense between the hot sheets, she fights
back her desire to laugh, scream, shout,
drown the sound that is tearing her
quivering nerves.
Still it goes on. That low, long-drawn,
inward sucking “ith” ; the crescendo that
seems to last minutes; the maddening
pause, when time itself seems to stop ;
then the rushing hiss of exhalation; the
final “pouff.”
Her husband.
Wild-eyed, she stares into his white,
heavy face. Why does he lie there like
a pig? Yes, that was it, a fat pig . . .
her harsh whisper joins the discord of
his breathing ... “a fat, white-faced,
lazy, good-for-nothing pig.”
A beam from the light in the laneway
outside streams obliquely through the
window to the bed. Even in this half-
light his face is a pudding —a steam pud-
ding gone soggy with water boiled
through the cloth. The eyelids puffy, the
nose heavy and coarse, with fine veins
criss-crossing like rivers on a relief map
of lumpy pores.
Pouting, heavy red lips overhang three
prickly rolls that ripple into a creased
neck and an undergrowth of hair. Then
his singlet—“He would sleep in that!”
Beyond, in the dappled light filtered
by the curtain, his stomach is an obese
wave. Its measured heave fascinates her.
Tick-tick, tick- tick, the cheap clock by
the bed keeps time. Ten ticks and the
wave reaches its crest ... a silence in
which the ticks break like dripping
water . . . fifteen more and the wave is
in the trough ... a pause . . . horrible
repetition.
“God, I can’t stand it!” Hysteria grips
her. “I hate him, loathe him! I never
married this!”
Across the bed rail, John’s trousers
sprawl, twisted and drunken as John’s
legs on a Saturday night . . .

footsteps. She could never forget them.
Once they had meant for her the quick,
almost suffocating sickness of palpitation,
and a —a glow. Now,'there was still the
sick feeling—disgust and hopelessness.
Slowly the steps echo, get nearer . . .
Standing with spoon poised and dripping
over a saucepan, Catherine listens;
imagines him swaying, hiccupping,
fumbling ; hears the groping scrape of
the key, the squeak of the hinge ; his
“Catherine —you there? Where are
you?” The steps come nearer, down the
hall. A bump and a curse in the dining-
room. Nearer the sound of breathing,
the smell of a spirit lamp, hot, fcetid . . .
HER nails bite into her hands. She
must not scream.
Beyond that one pool of light outside
night hides the ugliness that is her life ;
but it is in her heart, her soul, as real
as the monotonous breathing by her side.
A grey cat, dragging its belly, creeps
across the light-pool, a black shadow
trailing after. Across the dirty, narrow
lane yesterday’s washing flaps and sags
on Jones’s line . . . chimneys, tall and
grimy, high walls, glaring roofs, tiny
rubbish-strewn yards . . . like her life,
unsweet . . . but hidden now, changed
by night. Night hides all things, she
decides. Night can change all things.
Still the breathing goes on, on.
She holds her own breath. Strange
how it rises and hovers. It seems to
stop at the top. What —what if it did
not go on? No more Saturday nights—
just peace. She could kill him, kill her-
self.
Slowly, cautiously . . . She must not
wake him.
What is that? Something white against
the blackness. She moves an arm. The
white thing moves. Ah, the mirror! It
gives back a face, prematurely aged;
pleasant features twisted to an ugly
mask, framed by hair in wild disorder;
a white shoulder and breast bared by a
sagging cotton nightgown.
The mirror is blank. She creeps along
the passage to the kitchen. Last night’s
cabbage mingles with the smell of gas.
In the opened drawer of the dresser she
feels for the longer, rough staghorn
handle that is the carving-knife ; care-
fully drags it out.
“Mum, mummy.”
Catherine freezes, knife poised.
“What is it, dear?”
“I’m frightened.”
The knife falls with a clatter. The
child is whimpering, one hand shielding
eyes from the sudden light. She bends
over the low stretcher. “There, darling,
it’s all right. Mother’s with you.”
“There was a big dog, bigger than
Jones’s, with yellow eyes ... 1 was fall-
ing .. . take me into your bed, mummy.”
Small hands, hot with sleep, clutch
her neck.
“Of course, darling.”
Back in the bedroom, her husband
groans, heaves on his side. She tucks
her son between them and climbs in be-
side him, shivering. He snuggles to her.
She smiles.
After Moonrise.
Beyond the hills the sky is pale as flax.
I listen for the mopoke’s wistful bell
To toll from the dark scrub: but all I hear
Are tremulous thin flute calls of young lambs!
Dark as a blackbird’s breast the timber lands
Climb ebon pathways to the horizon;
And linger there —their swarthy faces furled
In filaments of cloud. The evening star
Smiles like a white magnolia in the west;
While yellow as a catkin a half-moon
Tilts in the hollowed heavens; its spilled light
Is like the drift of petals softly blowing
From some sky orchard, where exquisite trees
Of quince and pear lift blossom-burdened
boughs.
Here in the small home-meadow, budding
briars
Are threaded with pale moonstones, and the
grass
(Where soon red clover-blooms will glow like
garnets)
Is misted with evanescent veils of dew.
To-day the gale blew down the last dead leaves
From the old oak; and now they lightly lie
In little russet curls close to my feet.
I lift one and it crumbles into dust . . .
How fair the paddocks are beneath the moon!
The little idle winds play there, and dance
To sweet aeolian music; and the trees
Upon the earth cast broad bandanas down
Of silken shadow, deep and damson dark.
The breeze is sweet with wattle and boronia,
While in the still lee of the gorse-grown ridge
(Where green as verdigris the acid sorrel
Slants slenderly) the cattle kneel in sleep,
Their warm breath hanging silver on the air.

My Political
Life
By W. A.HOLMAN
CHANGES IN THE
MINISTRY
Our first party
business after Mc-
Gowen’s return
was to fill the
Cabinet vacancy caused by Nielsen’s
resignation. Technically, this should
have been the subject matter of another
ballot, but Dacey was so clearly indicated
for the vacancy that he came into his
own by the practically unanimous choice
of the party. Appointed by the Premier
to the Treasury, for finance was a branch
of public affairs to which he had given
lifelong attention, he signalised his
pathetically brief stay in that office by
three main achievements—an Income
Tax Bill, a housing scheme and a violent
quarrel with the Chief Railway Com-
missioner (Tom Johnson).
The last exploit was easy. In those
days any Minister who wanted a fight
could find one without difficulty at the
hands of our railway head. Not that
Johnson was extravagantly pugnacious,
but he was keenly aware of the strength
of his position, as disclosed by our earlier
brushes, and a little disposed to presume
upon the weakness of ours. He knew
that with our precarious majority and a
hostile Upper House we could not count
upon forcing through any amendment
hostile to his powers, and within the forti-
fications which the Railway Act provided
considered that there was a region marked
out in which his monarchy was absolute.
BEEBY
Under the re-
arrangement now
made of the port-
folios Carmichael relieved Beeby of both
the Education work and that of Labor
and Industry, and Beeby stepped into the
enormously difficult Ministry
of Lands. Shifting Beeby
from the Labor and Industry
Department was undoubtedly
a great loss in etfective ad-
ministration. There was no
one to replace him there,
while he was not considered
one of the party’s authorities
on land questions. But he
was gifted with an intelli-
gence which permitted him to
get a firm grip of any ques-
tion, and, as the representa-
tive of a country electorate
where alienation of Crown
lands had gone farther than
in most, he had given much
thought to the problem—
then urgent—of what should
be done about large estates.
He shared Nielsen’s repug-
nance for the conventional
policy of repurchase, and in
his search for some other
solution had formulated a
scheme which, with modifica-
tions in detail, has been
accepted in turn by each Government
since that day.
Griffith.
NIELSEN
As a team the
Ministry had not
been greatly
weakened by its changes so far. Nobody
could quite replace Nielsen in the gen-
eral effect of his presence in the Cabinet.
There was about Nielsen a suggestion
of indifference to all question of danger,
fatigue or annoyance that was a priceless
contribution to our collective thinking.
But Dacey was a man of equal strength
of character, and, if he lacked Nielsen’s
inexhaustible energy, he contributed a
far-sighted wisdom such as no other man
in our party had, which in some measure
compensated for it.
CARMICHAEL
Carmichael’s
transfer to the
Education port-
folio, on the other hand, turned out to
be a change entirely for the better, and
greatly affected during these two years
the distribution of our efforts. Under
this influence the subject became a
dominating one amongst us with remark-
able swiftness. In our democratic Min-
istry every dog had his day, and in itself
it was no surprise that a comparative
junior should take charge in his turn.
But Carmichael’s day was quite unex-
pectedly extensive and peculiar. In part,
no doubt, the submergence, temporary
or permanent, of other active men aided
this. Nielsen and Macdonell were miss-
ing, Dacey soon to go, I was played-out
and tired, Beeby was feeling his way in
an unfamiliar metier and Griffith was
commencing to commit certain “blazing
indiscretions,” the cumulative effect of
which was to make him a liability as well
as an asset. To these things unquestion-
ably the new Education Minister owed
in part his opportunity, of which he made
remarkable use.
LIVERPOOL
PLAINS
BY-ELECTION
Meanwhile
matters swept
smoothly along
towards the re-
storation of the
status quo. There
is no need to dwell upon the individual
steps by which we regained Liverpool
Plains, and with it our historic majority.
An Elections and Qualifications Commit-
tee was appointed, and a petition was
forwarded from Liverpool Plains against
the return of the Opposition candidate,
setting forth many irregularities in the
election. This petition was upheld by
the unanimous vote of the committee.
I stress this point because it is often
thought that decisions of a political body
must be necessarily partisan. The feel-
ing of the hour was very bitter —quite
exceptionally so. Nevertheless, the Oppo-
sition members of the committee all
voted for the quashing of the by-election,
which had meant so much to their party.
A further by-election was ordered. This
time no mistake was made by us about
the organisation, and our candidate was
triumphantly returned by a majority of
500. His return, as was recognised by
everybody, except the “Daily Telegraph,”
put an end to the enforced political in-
action which had ensued upon the resig-
nation of Dunn and Horne.
DACEY AND
TOM
JOHNSON
In those
days the rail-
ways were re-
garded as a
regular appan-
age of the
Treasury, and Dacey became
Johnson’s Minister. The
bringing of two such resolute
characters together in the one
sphere could have but one
result, and led forthwith to
collision. Dacey was at least
as forceful a personality as
Johnson, and much more
pugnacious.
The need of hurrying on
the duplication works had
become apparent to all of
us ; but here, as everywhere
else where questions of policy
emerged, the Chief Com-
missioner had views of his
own. Within a few weeks
the new Railway Minister
was calling for the Commis-
sioner’s head on a charger,
and demanding of Heaven,
like Henry 11., afflicted by a Becket, if
there was no one to deliver him from this
insolent knave. There were, he declared,
two Governments in the State, and John-
son, entrenched behind his Act, was the
head of the greater and more despotic
one.
This dispute was an incident which
I have touched upon here because it
forms an essential part of the history of
one of our many difficulties. Two strong
and able men closely associated in ad-
ministration cannot help disagreeing
about some things ; but they cannot help
agreeing about a great many more. The
Minister and Commissioner got on quite
well on the whole, in spite of their united
belief that they were always at daggers
drawn, and the railways probably had
their best time in the earlier history of
our Government during the four short
months to which destiny tragically con-
fined the career of our new colleague.

"I have suffered with gastritis (indi-
gestion, etc ) for the last 29 years. I
was none too well last April and could
hardly eat anything without pain. Seeing
your advertisement for * Bisurated *
Magnesia I bought a bottle and am pleased
to tell you that I got free from pain almost
at once. I can now eat my food without
fear of pain and I am in better health. I
send this letter with the object of being a
service to the public. I am truly very
grateful for the benefit I have had from
it.... I am keeping quite fit thanks to
* Bisurated ’ Magnesia.”
For indigestion, gastritis and other
painful stomach troubles there is no
more effective remedy than * Bisurated ’
Magnesia which has been used and

on the trunk lines to a crisis. On the
other hand, work in the duplicating had
fallen again to a bare minimum. To
Dacey’s expostulations the Commissioner
had replied that he was unable to go on
with it until he got large additional num-
bers of skilled workmen, more particu-
larly bridge-carpenters and bricklayers,
When asked where we were to get him
bridge-carpenters and bricklayers from
he had replied with malicious ingenuous-
ness, that we should bring them out from
Great Britain as immigrants, a sugges-
tion which was anathema in Labor
circles. On the other hand, our country
members were pressing us with the ut-
most ferTOr to get the duplication ex-
pedited in order that normal traffic con-
d,lions might be restored.
At next Cabinet we were accordingly
called on to determine whether we should
or should not meet Johnson’s requi-
sitions. The Commissioner’s views were
warmly supported by his Minister, but
it was clear in a few minutes that we had
arrived at an absolute impasse. Dacey
and his supporters urged that we should
at all hazards bring out the neces-
sary mechanics ; others, headed by the
Premier, that at all hazards we should
stick to our general pledges against im-
porting artisans. Ruin was freely pre-
dieted on both sides as the result of
adopting, or failing to adopt, either policy,
“If we lose the farmers we are done for”
was countered by “And if we alienate the
unions we are done for still worse.” For
an hour or so the only question under
debate was which of these methods of
political suicide we should select. It
was a situation where to act or not to
act seemed equally disastrous,
, MPO rtaTION
OF BRITISH
WORKERS
At t h „ t
meeting a propo-
, J* ,T jL
was rnn^d „ r pd
Thl copsiaereci
straight to th"
Trades and Labor Council (the Trades
Hall delegates) and explain pur difficulty.
We should make it clear that, though we
were, as a rule, against the importation
by the Government of ready-made
mechanics, special circumstances made it
essential at Hie moment. We would
pledge ourselves to bring out none but
trade-unionists of good standing with
clearance-cards from their unions in
Britain, and to assure that we would ask
the council to elect some competent repre-
sentative who would be sent to Britain
by us in a temporarily official position
to supervise the selection. With these
guarantees our trade-union backers ought
not to consider we were abandoning them
if in order to meet a special emergency
we departed for a time from our de-
clared policy.
Up to this moment the idea that the
trade-union movement could be got, by
any known means, to alter its attitude
on this question had never dawned upon
anybody. My colleagues were aghast
at what they considered the audacity of
this plan, and the chief himself had de-
manded which of us I thought was
going down to bell the cat? There was
nothing for it, of course, but to say that I
would, and on this and certain other un-
derstandings my proposals were adopted.
The council, to the surprise of the doubt-
ers of the Cabinet, gave us an extremely
reasonable and friendly reception.
I put the whole of our cards on the table,
and concealed nothing of our difficulties
and uncertainties, but pointed out the ad-
vantages we hoped to gain. A resolution
was carried, practically unanimously, ex-
pressing the confidence of the council
and agreeing to appoint a supervisor.
At a later date Andrew Spence (not to
be confounded with W. G. Spence,
M.H.R., of the Shearers’ Union —they
were not related at all), one of the
ablest of the very able band of officers
then guiding union affairs, was selected
and sent to London, where he did excel-
lent work. The necessary recruits came
out, and the interrupted work of railway
building was got on to its way once more.
This was a gratifying experience for
me—more so than the actual importance
of the incident would suggest—and the
more especially so as I had not been pre-
viously marked persona grata with the
union world. It had been in the habit
of looking upon me not only as an “in-
tellectual,” i.e., a man who had come to
the front of the Labor movement by
other than trade-union routes, but as a
“lawyer” as well, and I was the subject
of prejudices in both capacities.
PREMIERS’
CONFERENCE:
STATE RIGHTS
AGAIN
During Janu-
ary of 1912 a
Premiers’ Con-
ference was held
in Melbourne. I
seized the oppor-
tunity it afforded
to bring forward an entirely new propo-
sal on the question of the Common-
wealth’s enlarged powers. A provision
exists in the Constitution under which
any two States may unitedly refer to the
Commonwealth, for Federal handling,
any topic, even though it be essentially a
State matter. 1 proposed to achieve the
settlement of The dispute by the use of
these powers; thus, as I hoped, avoiding the
necessity of another referendum and the
various unpleasant consequences—both
public and personal—likely to attend it.
Another outstanding feature of my
plan was a proposal to hand industrial
arbitration in its entirety over to Com-
monwealth control. This also was a new
idea, and went far beyond what the most
enthusiastic Federalists had hitherto con-
templated. It was assailed by the State-
righters of the other States as an impos-
sible proposal. It was, in point of fact, a
strictly logical one, as there was no real
warrant for having two sets of arbitra-
tion tribunals.
We did not, I pointed out, have two
sets of post offices ; a State post office to
carry letters round the corner and a
Federal post office to carry them to
another State. The whole business of
letter-carrying was managed from a
central office for all Australia, and
quite similarly the whole business of
settling industrial questions when they
arose could be taken in hand by one Gov-
ernment and managed by that Govern-
ment without difficulty. I did not con-
sider the Federal Government so well
qualified for the work as the individual
States, but I was ready to make the sac-
rifice in view of the great strength of the
opposite view amongst trade-unionists.
My scheme was, however, never truly
acceptable to either side. Ardent Labor
men denounced it, not entirely without
truth, as a device for side-stepping the
obligations of any forthcoming referen-
dum campaign, whilst the representatives
of the more conservative Governments
from Queensland and Victoria thought
that on the arbitration question I was
surrendering the citadel of State rights
into the hands of the common enemy.
Few men in Australia can escape the
imputation of having varied in their views
as to the best solution of this perennial
difficulty. The whole problem began
with Federation, and from time to time
one’s idea would change as to what was
the main factor in it. Broadly speaking,
the principal difficulty I felt was the exis-
tence of a double set of laws, overlapping
and sometimes conflicting, made by two
independent authorities dealing with the
same subject within the same territory.
PROS AND CONS
At other times,
all the same, the
suggested remedy
—with its ultra-centralisation and con-
gestion of causes in a single tribunal
at Melbourne —struck one as an even
greater evil, and men sighed for some
greater localisation of the work.
Thus it was unavoidable that one
should fluctuate to some extent be-
tween the idea of carrying everything
to Melbourne—which appealed when one
thought of it as an escape from an other-
wise intolerable duplication of law and
administration —and the idea of scattering
the powers entirely among the States, and
getting rid of Federal control altogether.
There were many halting places be-
tween these extremes. At that moment
I was prepared to make a big bid for
some measure of administrative peace,
and steeled myself to endure the aban-
donment of State authority involved if,
by handing over the whole business, body
and bones, to the Federal authority, peace
could be secured. I met, however, with
the usual fate of mediators, that of being
roundly abused by both parties, and my
elaborate schemes bore no practical re-
sults.
In this I was not entirely disappointed.
My main purpose had been to bring be-
fore the Labor world the fact that there
were other methods of handling the ques-
tion, and particularly, if such a thing
were possible, to turn its face again
to the reasonable proposals of the con-
ference of 1908. I had been aiming at
propaganda rather than at achievement,
and the enormous publicity given my pro-
posals was all to the good. The educa-
tional process I was driving at was
effected to some extent, and men began to
see that the possible positions were not
merely those of acceptance or rejection
of Hughes’s scheme —that there was a
third attitude possible, aiming at a scien-
tific adjustment of the difficulty without
revolution for its own sake.
[Another chapter from Holman’s Life will
be given in next week’s Bulletin.]
From ex-Speaker Willis
My attention has been directed to a
statement by the late W. A. Hol-
man in his “Political Life” (B.
9/l/’35) which is untrue. You say that
Mr. Holman —then Acting-Premier—
discussed with me his views relating to
the Liverpool Plains election at the time
of my accepting nomination to the
Speakership. Namely, “I accordingly
had an interview with Willis myself, and
explained the whole position as we saw
it—that we believed the Liverpool Plains
result was quite misleading and that we
really had our majority unimpaired ; that
we wanted a temporary continuance of
the House to allow us to test this; that
if it should prove that we were wrong
we would dissolve thereafter and go to
the country, but only if we found that
the majority with which we had entered
Parliament had permanently dis-
appeared.”
Such an interview did not take place
with Mr. Holman, nor was such a state-
ment made to me at any time by any-
body.
Mr. Arthur Griffith and Mr. Beeby
(now Judge) had a talk with me at Par-
liament House about a crisis. Subse-
quently Mr. Griffith submitted the offer
of a portfolio in the Ministry and the
Speakership to Mr. David Storey—then
the leader of a third party of four
members. Mr. David Storey took time
to consult with friends, and later de-
clined the offer. Then it was that Mr.
Arthur Griffith, on behalf of the Acting-
Premier, Mr. Holman, invited me to
accept the Speakership. In reply I defi-
nitely stated to him certain conditions
upon which I would entertain the pro-
posal. During the luncheon hour I put
into writing definite conditions; in the
meantime Mr. Griffith saw Mr. Holman.
Upon my return .to the House, Mr.
Griffith stated that he had communicated
to Mr. Holman my conditions and he
would accept them. I read over my
written conditions, whereupon he re-
marked, “You will now wish to see Hol-
man.” He took me to a party room, and
I handed to Mr. Holman my written
conditions. He read the memorandum
and said he would accept on behalf of
the Government. Taking a sheet of
paper, he. wrote out a copy of the same.
Handing back the original he appeared
nervous, and excitedly remarked: “The
reporters will be here directly they hear
of it; I must write a statement for the
press.” He had not written much when
Mr. Griffith suggested amendment. I
left them at their task; probably the
statement appeared in the daily press the
next morning.
I consider your published statement,
said to be written by Mr. W. A. Hol-
man, a damaging libel to cover up his
perfidy.
[The Bulletin regrets that Mr. Willis
takes that view of it. The memoiy of a
public man writing his recollections is
apt to play tricks with him, but Holman
obviously regarded the 1911-13 Speaker
with high admiration and respect.]

False teeth often follow Pyorrhea, which comes to four people
out of five past the age of 40.
Why must
millions suffer
with Pyorrhea ?
WTIEN permitted to go unchecked, pyorrhea can rob you of your teeth;
make your face look pinched and old; undermine your entire health by
spreading virulent poisons throughout your system.
This is indeed a bitter price to pay for neglect. The menace is greater than
most people realise, because four out of five past the age of forty suffer with
this dread disease of the gums.
This condition exists mainly because pyorrhea so often infects the gums
in youth, and lurks there for years before the victim realises its
pernicious presence.
Ward off danger before the . gums bleed
Once it is established, pyorrhea cannot be cured by Forhan s or any other
toothpaste. Don’t postpone the protection which may prevent the loss of your
teeth (and of your general health). Before your gums bleed start cleansing
the teeth and massaging the gums with Forhan s twice each day. And see
your dentist twice a year at least —his care can do much to guard the
health of your teeth and mouth. Remember that half the people who wear
false teeth must do so because they failed to guard against pyorrhea.
An amazing dentifrice developed by dentist
Forhan’s is the formula of R. J. Forhan, D.D.S., who for 26 years specialised
in the treatment of pyorrhea. It is unique in that it contains Forhan s
Pyorrhea Astringent, an ethical preparation developed by Dr. Forhan and
used by thousands of dentists in treating pyorrhea.
Don’t gamble with Pyorrhea
No one is immune from this infection, and, remember, it may be at work
in your mouth for years before you know it. Resolve to give your teeth the
finest care. Use Forhan’s twice each day. So mild and gentle, so pure and
thorough a cleansing agent, you can make no finer investment in the health
of your mouth and the safety of your teeth.
