ESCAPE FROM MANILA
Urged out of Germany by Hitler
in 1935, Albert Kiestadt, of The Sea
Was Kind (Constable), was an importer
in Japan when the Japanese were on
the verge of World War II; he managed
to be in Manila by Pearl Harbor. This
book is an account of his flight of a
year and two days from Manila to
Australia.
He was actually in Japanese hands
after the taking of Manila, but evaded
imprisonment by pretending that he
was a German Nazi, and therefore an
ally; but the Japanese trailed him
across Luzon and were only a day
behind him when he escaped by out-
riggers to Maricaban and Mindoro,
travelled 50 miles down Mindoro by
cattle-truck to Bongabong and walked
20 miles to a village where a 60ft.
schooner took him to Looc, on Tablas
Island. Here he was imprisoned until
police got American permission to
let him pass, went to Panay, where he
was imprisoned again, and then spent
several months at Iloilo, where business
was as usual, awaiting the certain
Japanese takeover. When this came,
Kiestadt “rode his luck” with the
Japanese, saw them torturing and
shooting Filipinos, acted for two days
as chauffeur to a senior Japanese
officer and at last, told to report to
the military police, escaped—with a
few charts, a pair of dividers, a 4in.
boat’s compass and a little money—
to the small island of Guimaras.
Here he eventually bought a 24ft.
sloop, the Maring. From the sketch
he gives of her she was anything but
a pretty craft, but on her he sailed
several hundred miles, past the island
of Negros and down the Zamboangan
Peninsula of Mindanao, meeting fierce
Moro seamen, and being adopted by a
Moro chief at Sangboy. Doubling
back up the Zamboangan coast, he
found at Labason a Filipino officer,
Lieutenant Young, who wanted to get
his wife to the island of Jolo and then
go on to Australia.
So Kiestadt allowed a transaction to
go through of which he speaks a little
remorsefully. The sloop Maring was
forced by his friends upon a Chinese
trader in exchange for a “cumbit,”
the Kakugan, a long, low. open craft,
of 35ft., with a huge square sail rigged
like a lateen-sail. With a crew of five
Moros under a Moro sailing-master,
the Kakugan took Kiestadt and Young
all the way from Labasan on Mindanao
to Arnhem Land, Australia, and prac-
tically without incident, except for two
mutinies.
One of the mutinies was after a
Japanese patrol launch passed the
Kakugan when she was sheltering in
a Morotai lagoon. The launch took
aboard a fisherman who had paddled
out to it from the island on which the
Kakugan crew were hiding, and
departed, presumably to get help
in dealing with the Kakugan.
Kiestadt wasted no time in putting
to sea. but that evening the crew, using
Young as their spokesman, changed
course, and told Kiestadt that they
were returning to the Philippines.
Kiestadt countered by threatening not
to navigate.
A few days later, because the wind
had lulled, the crew mutinied again,
but this time Young acted with
Kiestadt to talk them out of it, and
the journey was resumed. One of the
photographic exhibits is the sailing-
master’s kris, with which, at one time,
Kle-stadt was to have been beheaded.
But if the journey was without
much other incident, Kiestadt makes
it- full of interest, with his pages on
navigating his curious craft by dead-
reckoning, on trying to make the Moros
keep the boat clean, on medical inspec-
tions, etc. And back on Zamboanga
there are colorful accounts on the cele-
brations attending his adoption, a non-
Moslem, into the Moslem Moro’s
family, of his visit to a community of
missionaries hiding from the Japanese
in a big camp in the rain-forest, on the
battle when Klestadt’s Moro friends
from down the coast embarrassed him
by invading the community of his
friends at Labason ... A curious lot of
memories to recur to a Melbourne
importer, which Mr. Kiestadt is now.
Looking at his picture at the back of
the book, in a check shirt with yachts
in the background, you might say,
“Ah. a young Australian yachting type
—but how would he stand up to real
seagoing experience?”
THE FINCHES
A tiny spill of bird-things in a swirl
and crest and tide that splashed the
garden's edge,
a chatterful of finches, filled the hedge
and came upon us with a rush and curl
and scattering of wings. They were so
small
l laughed to see them ludicrously gay
among the thorny stalks, and all that day
they teased me with their tiny-throated
call.
They were a jest, a scampering of neat
brisk sweets, they were all such frivolities
I did not think to call them real, l was
too merry with their flight to see the heat
that angered their few days . to recognise
my own stern hungers in their fragile
cries.

THOMAS W. SHAPCOTT.
Marbles Are In
It takes a pretty inventive mind to
find a new way of writing an auto-
biography; and this reviewer dips his
lid to Pat Lawlor, whose Old Welling-
ton Days (Whitcombe and Tombs) is
the most surprising novelty in this
field since Norman Douglas thought of
turning-up all the old visiting-cards
people had left with him, and so
recalling the people.
Because he could never bear to
destroy them, Pat Lawlor has pre-
served for half-a-century or so the
diaries he kept as a boy; and if ardent
Wellingtonians, and New Zealanders in
general, will enjoy sharing the
memories which these evoke in him,
the general reader is likely to find the
boyhood diaries, because they catch
the universal spirit of boyhood, alto-
gether captivating. Lawlor prints an
extract from the diaries at the head
of each short chapter and then adds
the appropriate commentary. Thus
we read that on January 14, 1900,
“Maggie and me saw a net being
hauled in on the esplanade,” and so
to the commentary, “Thorndon
Esplanade was a wonderful place for
us in those days. The promenade
extended as far as Davis Street and

MACQUARIE'S YEAR
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY years
ago—at the New Year, 1810 —the
Royal Naval ships Hindostan and
Dromedary were warped into Sydney
Cove, having shown their numbers at
the Heads three days before and lain
within them until the westerlies should
abate.
In the storeship Dromedary came
Governor Lachlan Macquarie and his
wife Elizabeth, supported by the 73rd
Regiment of Foot, the Second Bat-
talion of the Black Watch, and bringing
with them the first legally qualified
Judge Advocate, Ellis Bent.
They found themselves decanted
into a settlement which was called
“The Camp” and which had military
sentinels patrolling its key positions.
As a colony it was scarcely attractive.
A few hundred yards from the water’s
edge in the cove the Acting Lieutenant-
Governor, Colonel Paterson, shared the
rickety structure at the corner of Bridge
and Phillip streets (which was called
Government House) with the white-
ants and a large supply of bad liquor.
A little lower down the hill the
equally drunken retiring Judge Advo-
cate dwelt with his daughters and an
assorted collection of chickens and pigs.
The dwellings of these two potentates
looked across the low buildings huddled
close to the foul Tank Stream to the
parade-ground where the insurrection
against Bligh had blossomed almost
exactly two years before.
A few shops in whose windows
stolen jewellery glittered; an
orphanage to hold the several hundred
minors unwanted by now unidentifiable
parents; the military barracks of the
102nd Regiment (lately the New South
Wales Corps) and a crumbling mass
of stores; there was little to
interest the eye of the visiting stranger
except these and the hovels and dives
of the population—9o per cent, convict
or of convict-origin —and the gallows
towards which some of the organisers
of the 1808 rebellion looked with
apprehension.
TVrATURE alone had grandeur or
beauty in New South Wales.
Including the fringe of rude settle-
ments that reached out about 40 miles
to the Hawkesbury and the Nepean
and less in the south, plus the Siberia
of six-year-old Newcastle, there were,
all told, only about 10,000 inhabitants
on the Australian mainland.
A century-and-a-half after this
depressing opening day of 1810 there
are at least three office-buildings under
construction in the City of Sydney
each of which would have held the
whole of the inhabitants of the town
itself in 1810 —one of them nearly
double the total —on the basis of what
is now regarded as proper working-
space for office-workers.
Though little was expected at the
time of Macquarie’s advent, after a
not very distinguished career, mainly
as a subordinate, the striking fact
remains that in the contentious eleven
years during which he ruled the Terri-
tory of New South Wales civilisation
and the germ of freedom took root
for the first time on Australian soil,
and that the credit for this lay almost
entirely with him.
He built the first buildings large
enough and substantial enough to
assure that they would not crumble
into ruins or be unworthy of saving,
as happened with the few crude struc-
tures put up by his predecessors.
The central portion of Parliament
House in Macquarie Street and the
building now known as the “old
Mint” (surgeon’s barracks to his
hospital) still survive as the oldest
public buildings on the Australian
continent, both with histories of
thrilling import.
Greenway’s old convict barracks,
which he completed at the top of King
Street in 1819, was the City of Sydney’s
first building of architectural beauty
and value, though now it is half-
smothered in unworthy accretions
which are a disgrace to recent
Governments. Its clock, built to Mac-
quarie’s order, is Australia’s first town-
clock. and still marking-off the hours,
though its chimes are lost in the roar
of the traffic.
The first enduring churches on the
continent Macquarie built St.
Matthew’s at Windsor, St. Luke’s at
Liverpool, and St. James’ in Sydney.
It is fitting that the Conservatorium
of Music should be housed in a monu-
mental building that he had put up
on the fringes of the Domain, which
he transformed into one of the earliest
of our parks, along with Macquarie
Place and Hyde Park. He was the
first vice-regal patron of Australian
literature—appointing our one and
only “poet laureate,” nurturing the
young Australians who were beginning
to practise the arts.
He started the first Australian steam-
engine on its career.
Macquarie was, again, the first to
organise the bursting-through of the
mountain barriers which had held
Australian continental settlement con-
fined to a shelf on the Pacific Ocean
littoral.
He officially founded the first town
west of the Blue Mountains in 1815,
and the first town horth of Newcastle
in 1819 at Port Macquarie.
He opened the way to the area of
the Goulburn Plains and Canberra, and
in all the outlands established security
and stability of settlement centring
round townships which led to the
foundation of pastoral development, as
his' two banks were the foundation-
stones of organised private finance
and his “holey dollars and dumps” our
first native coinage.
TTHE man who first used the name
A “Australia” officially, who uttered
the first pleadings in favor of humanity
and forgiveness as the essentials of the
reform of the convict, deserves better
of the country in which he would have
liked to end his days.
His works are worth recalling if
only to use them as a standard against
which to measure the tremendous
growth that has taken place in a
century-and-a-half.
Australia today has a population
swiftly approaching that of the Eng-
land and Wales of *lBlO. Its largest
city is the peer in size and wealth of
the London of his day. The southern
continent has become a power in the
world into which it is now so closely
integrated by reason of the develop-
ment of fast sea- and air-transport.
In Macquarie’s day there was little
chance that New South Wales would
ever grow beyond the status of a
shepherd kingdom peopled by graziers
and peasants and those who supplied
the needs which the British manufac-
turer could not supply. The limit
of its possibilities was written in the
arid plains and deserts of the interior.
Today a flourishing technology and
a fine racial ambition and stamina are
driving Australia onward into an era
in which our descendants will over-
come the difficulties and fill the gaps
in the Commonwealth’s elemental
development needs.
This country is already one which
its “father” —so described on his lonely
tomb on the island of Mull —-would not
recognise. And it is certainly on the
way to a growth within the next
century-and-a-half which is almost
beyond the conception of Australians
of today.




PLAIN ENGLISH
The Economies of Peace
The Prime Minister’s summary of the
prospects for 1960 was fairly compre-
hensive and safe on broad issues; but any-
body would be an Old Moore who did
too much prophesying against what he
calls the “strange, uncertain and uneasy
background provided by world events.”
As he says, “No man knows the
future —he can only guess,” and about
the only thing he is sure of is that the
solidity of the progress which Australia
is making must be based on diligent work,
skill and co-operation of employer and
employee with the maintenance of a
common national purpose, and that not
merely to get as much pay for as little
work as possible.
It certainly seems that this tendency,
so vaunted by Dr. Evatt and his friends
a few years ago in conjunction with the
propaganda for the 40-hour, and later
35-hour, week, of which the late Mr.
Cahill had become the arch-advocate
during his last few months as Premier,
is now dying under the impact of an
influx of youth which will continue to
swell through the expanded birthrates of
the World War II era.
A great deal of the development of
Australia is due to the increased willing-
ness of young men and women to pitch
into their jobs, and the pacemaking of
European immigrants who look on the
kind of leisure advertised by the Labor
party as a bait to catch followers as
shameful and unnatural.
With the growing fountain of talent
and energy which is being thrown-up
by the new Australian age of expansion,
the Commonwealth should continue to
go ahead in big leaps—provided
world conditions do not alter in trend.
It must not, however, be forgotten
that those conditions are in some
respects unnaturally stimulated. The
world market, for instance, is one that
has been stocking-up to replace the ruin
of war. This has called for an unpre-
cedented amount • of raw materials and
transport and heavy-industry production.
Again, the world is in an unnatural
economic state because a vast portion
of the markets is created by the need
for the civilised countries of the West to
live virtually on a war-time footing of
defence, with big outlays to keep mil-
lions of men employed either actually
in the armed forces or in the industries
which supply them.
Moreover, the cold war is a highly
competitive business in which there are
huge scrappings and replacements as
armament and methods and consequent
needs change with breathless rapidity.
It is curious that those who benefit
most by this condition are those who
are most insistent on the need for world
peace so that the Glorious Days may
be prolonged.
But the fact remains that in the unlikely
event of the summit-conference coming
to an agreement to do away with arms
there will be a remarkable world-
revolution in the economies on both sides
of the Iron Curtain ; and unless there
is a gigantic and universal plan to ease
the world out of an armed era into an
unarmed one the political and economic
results of peace might be much more
dire than those of continuous readiness
for war.
New and Old Melbourne
Melbourne becomes an increasingly
less leisured and pleasant place in which
to drive, shop and eat, and almost
impossible in which to drink, all due to
changing conditions, chiefly economic-;
but its development as a modern city
almost equals the drive and confidence
of the ’nineties, when it was at least
one of the most progressive cities in the
world.
The signing of the agreement with
Pan-American Airways for a £5-million
hotel on the Eastern Market site will
remove within a few years the shabby
old buildings to which the City Council
has clung so firmly for decades for such
a purpose, just as the agreement with
Underhill, signed a few months ago, will
remove the almost equally dreary old
building now known as the Western
Market and replace it with a £6-million
25-story office-block and open garden-
plaza.
Less palatable is the sight at the corner
of Elizabeth and Collins Streets, where
the granite, marble, bronze and cedar
of the Colonial Mutual Life’s wonderful
old building, the former Equitable, is
biting the dust because it is economically
outmoded ; and syndicates continue to
tear down the mansions of pre-Federa-
tion Toorak for small houses with tiny
gardens, or blocks of flats with hardly
any.
Canberra heeded the protests from
authorities on building and Australian
history and rescinded an earlier resolve
to pull down the Customs House,
generally acknowledged to be the finest
building in Melbourne ; and the National
Trust has opened to the public (at a
modest half-a-crown) the historic
Armitage home, Como, overlooking
South Yarra and much of Toorak.
It now has to be paid for, but the
Trust no doubt will succeed in this since
it has co-opted the assistance of rich
ladies who know precisely how to get
money out of other rich ladies who know
how to get it out of them.
On balance, the rebuilding of Mel-
bourne is proceeding with admirable
enterprise, intelligence for its present
needs, and reasonable anticipation of the
future, and in the two instances of Como
and the Customs House without too
ruthless a use of the bulldozer.
The P.A.A. hotel will have at least
250 rooms, with off-street car-parking
for 300, and, eventually 500, cars. It will
be an “international” hotel, which prob-
ably means American. The agreement,
before it was signed, was altered to
extend the lease to 99 years, to give
three years’ free rental and to revise the
rent every 15 (not 10) years, without a
murmur.
In the case of the English company
which leased the Western Market site,
similar changes were greeted with cries
of great distress.
Costs in "Golden ’Sixties"
Something for Australians to ponder
when digesting the news that the U.S.A.
expects in 1960 to have the greatest
boom-year in its history is that the 15
nationally known economists who predict
the boom also claim that the U.S. retail-
price index will rise by only 1 per cent,
during the year, and that the wholesale
index will be even more stable.
In Australia the recent margins-
increases, plus the effect of the June,
1959, 15s. increase in the basic wage,
make prospects of price-stability in this
country look most remote. Face-to-face
with stability in other countries, price-
inflation in Australia would make export-
ing difficult in the case of depressed com-
modities, and altogether tend to make
us odd-man-out in international trade.
Yet, like New Zealand, we depend
greatly on international trade.
Working on the cycle theory, the 15
U.S. economists reckon the peak of the
American boom is still a year to 18
months away. In summarising the views
of the forum, Martin Gainsbrugh, chief
economist of the conference, said that “a
year from today this as-yet-young boom
will be 12 months older. In that 12
months it may not only mature but
become an ageing boom. We shall be
building stresses and strains into this
boom, as we have in every past period
of prosperity, that will culminate in the
next business contraction. Nevertheless,
as we enter the golden ’sixties, the peak
of this boom is not yet in sight.”
To any country facing the prospect
of a boom and a following recession the
economic equivalent of “keep your
powder dry” is “keep your costs down.”
Australia should take this very much to
heart. Progress (such as Australia aims
at) without inflation is perhaps an ideal
not to be attained ; progress with some
inflation is possibly the best we can hope
for; but inflation without progress is
certainly the lot of the country that
doesn’t make prudent efforts to keep its
costs firmly under control.
Education Costs
As usual, the Victorian Government is
taking its familiar battering from spokes-
men of various teachers’ organisations,
of whom there are quite an articulate
number, as the new school-year
approaches.
Education is, however, the field in
which the Bolte Government has accom-
plished its most effective work for the
Victorian community aside, possibly,
from housing.
The Government has given first
priority to school-buildings. There are
continual Labor complaints about the
lag in building schools, but in Labor’s


last year in office, 1954-55, school-build-
ings were a long way from top priority.
Bolte, with the loyalty successors display
to their predecessors in office, declines
to say how far down ; but it was, in
fact, seventh.
Labor was then spending somewhat
more than £4 million a year on capital-
works for education; this year the
Government is spending £9.5 million on
capital-works, of which £6 million will
be for school-buildings.
These figures for free education in
buildings that are used about five hours
a day for about 200 days a year con-
tinue to grow, and must continue to do
so with 20,000 new pupils a year being
enrolled in Victoria.
Perturbation at the cost is evident in
the U.S., where experiments are being
made with a longer school-day, a longer
school-year, summer-holiday teaching,
and, as in Russia, a six-day week.
Focus on Japan
The recent conference organised by the
World Federation of Trades Unions in
Tokyo and attended by the leaders of the
world’s Communist-controlled unions
(mainly those dealing with transport, and
including Healy of the Watersiders, a
functionary of the Communist Party of
Australia) was held in Tokyo not with-
out particular purpose. It has proved to
be a prime factor in a policy directed
from Peking to take-over Japanese Labor
and ripen Japan for entry into the Com-
munist bloc.
While the Red Chinese Government
has been trying its blandishments on the
Japanese Government and politicians and
succeeded in persuading a former Premier
to visit Mao’s headquarters —an expedi-
tion which engendered cold disapproval
in Japanese official and press circles —
the pressure is on in all surrounding
countries to force the Japanese labor
situation and control Japanese defence
and alliances. It is aimed to do this
through the use of sea- and wharf-unions,
of which the management in the United
States and Australia seems to be a Com-
munist monopoly.
The Left in the Australian Labor
Party, including Dr. Evatt, still shows
bitter hostility to Japan, and is out-of-
step with the rest of the Western parties,
Labor or otherwise, in refusing to let
bygones be bygones. Anything this
section can do to promote amity with
Peking and continued hatred of Japan it
does. It would seem impossible, for
instance, for Les Haylen to write about
Japan such a book as he has written
about Red China without endangering
himself politically.
Both Moscow and Red China keep-up
a steady barrage of submerged threats
running parallel with a programme of
enticement to Japan to enter the Red
trade-zone and break its alliances with
the United States. Harry Bridges, leader
of the American Longshoremen who
correspond to Healy’s wharflaborers in
U.S., is the leader of this movement.
He has suddenly become the champion
of the “Japanese toilers” and has
threatened to have his union-members
completely block all shipping from the
U.S. and Hawaii unless Japanese
working-conditions are improved, an
interference not only with Japan’s own
self-government but with American
defence plans.
Bridges has also threatened publicly to
produce wholesale wharf-strikes to pre-
vent the United States backing Chiang
Kai-shek if the latter should attempt a
landing in Red China.
All this is in line with the proceedings
of the Tokyo conference, which veno-
mously denounced the “backward work-
ing-conditions” of wharf-workers in all
the countries and islands of the Far
East in which there is either U.S. defence
or Seato organisation.
There is no doubt but that Japan is a
major target of Communist operations in
the cold war and that the situation is
aggravated by the fact of the South
Korean Government’s hatred of Japan,
leaving the United States, wf}ich plays the
role of suzerain and nursemaid to
Synghman Rhee, under suspicion with
some Japanese,
Summit Manoeuvres
New Year opens on the international
front with the Kremlin and Peking
carrying on their campaign for creating
confusion of thought among their
prospective victims of world-revolution,
promoting it with their usual continuity
of policy and energy.
At the Christmas weekend it was
announced that the Soviet Union had
agreed to a summit - conference in Paris
in April following quickly on Khrush-
chev’s visit to de Gaulle.
The same day Moscow Radio broad-
cast a “Merry Christmas” to the United
States and oozed goodwill to the whole
world ; but, of course, the United States
had no chance to reciprocate, since its
radio is jammed at the Russian end.
Khrushchev followed with a warning-
special Iy designed to frighten Europe—
that he would use the H-bomb in total
war.
Iraq, now almost a Russian satellite
armed with Russian arms, was engaged
in threatening the peace of the world,
fulminating in Communist language
against the “imperialism” which is sup-
posedly inciting Persia to cause dissen-
sion by resisting the attempts of Kassem
to grab territory which seems to be
Persian and which the Persians have
long held.
The Persian border situation is remark-
ably like that of the Indian and Nepalese
border situation along the Himalayas,
with the Communists encroaching by
armed force, opening fire, and "then
accusing their victims of aggression.
The technique is also remarkably like
that of Russia when it decided to attack
Finland in 1940 on the ground of little
Finland’s determination to attack Russia,
which had sixty times the population of
Finland and supposedly an armed force
which could not only have handled
Finland but the world at large.
While the Iraqis, convulsed in their
own local politics, were intent on seizing
the strategic junction of the Shat-el-Arab
and Tigris and threatening to crush not
only Persia but its “inciter,” were bring-
ing the Middle East to the edge of
general war with the backing of a Russia
curiously silent about peace in that area,
the Chinese w'ere massing troops along
the Himalaya Line and threatening
India.
Khrushchev seems—emphasis is on
“seems” — to be attempting to dissociate
himself from Chinese policy, but he is
undoubtedly behind the Iraqis ; other-
wise they would not have been served
so promptly and with such advanced
priority with armaments which enabled
them to turn traitors to the Baghdad
Pact.
By the end of the year it was
announced “authoritatively” from Delhi
that Mao’s forces were being equipped
to attack whatever Indian-border terri-
tories they wish to take when the snow
melts in April and that the Indians will
make only a token resistance unless deep
infiltration is intended.
Nehru, as everybody expected, will
most likely go no further than words,
which will certainly please his Marxian-
minded Defence Minister, Mr. Menon.
The possibilities are complicated by
the fact that Khrushchev has suddenly
announced that he will visit Indonesia in
February.
If Indonesia were to turn Communist
it would alter the whole world situation,
for it would put Malaya, Indo-China
and India and Pakistan in a Communist
sandwich. And it would bring Australia
right onto the fringe of the Communist
world advance.
It is reported to be a virtual certainty
that Khrushchev will also visit Nehru
after or before his visit to Djakarta and
Soekarno.
Behind the scenes Western Govern-
ments are not likely to be as easy about
the situation as a self-satisfied press
which rushes to publicise, with apparent
credulity, every confusing or other rumor
or opinion the Kremlin or Peking desires
to diffuse throughout the “capitalist”
world.
The most significant fact, of which
little or nothing is read or heard except
in the world’s handful of responsible
dailies, is that behind the Communist
scenes Khrushchev in the past six weeks
has stepped -up his advocacy of the
establishment of world-Comnianism and
of the immolation of the Western system
of civilisation ; also his advocacy of a
tightening of the links between the
campaigns of Communist parties
throughout the world under Moscow
co-ordination.
Many of the things he is saying for
consumption within the Communist
sphere are in direct contradiction to the
sentiments which he is uttering for
Western consumption.

(N.S.W.) Rotarians have sold some 2000
Christmas-trees, chiefly in Sydney, as they
have done for several years, spending the
money on projects that have benefited
townspeople generally. Their club has
come to an arrangement with the Blue
Mountains City Council to develop a
catchment-area as a pine-plantation. The
council provides the land and the trees,
and the Rotarians do the work. The
club will harvest each alternate pine at
Christmas-tree stage and the remainder
will be allowed to mature as council
property, the aim being to develop an
income-producing sideline that will help
to cut rates for posterity.

“5 G.R.”: When I last met the G.-G.
by his invitation a couple of years ago
1 did so with a little nervousness. I
needn’t have worried. The former Cap-
tain Bill Slim, D. 5.0., M.C., 6th Gurkha
Rifles, turned on a Gurkha grin. When
we sat down and yarned over the old
days of the Gurkha Brigade in Abbotta-
bad it was obvious he was a Gurkha
right through, wfth a high sense of duty,
a keen sense of the ludicrous. I went
back over the years when we Gurkha
officers had to pass in Gurkhali and
Urdu. Bill Slim was soon a master of
both, and, as adjutant of his battalion,
inspired also by the formidable Major
Cecil Allanson of Gallipoli fame, Bill
Slim and his regiment vied with us for
efficiency. Frontier wars separated the
brigade for some years. We were never
to know that lovely hill-station again as
a brigade. Many officers had gone to
their homes all over the world, many
bearing the indelible impression of the
Gurkha song: “Gaiety, simplicity,
bravery and loyalty. And love of high
achievement. And the strength that love
instils.” Slim embodies those lessons.
On his desk was a silver statuette of a
Gurkha: Gurkha simplicity, their sense
of humor, and of bravery and loyalty,
had a big part in his life.

than the Queen Mary's. Similarly, for
our drive-in bank I expect that children
in billycarts would be welcome provided
they were bent on buying a moneybox
or opening a savings-bank account. 1
like to picture that bank with milk-carts,
billycarts, vans and all the other varieties
of rolling-stock in a queue. No great
trouble there with traffic-control; but
the sail-in bank presents all sorts of
complications powered boats have to
give way to sailing-craft, and so on. Per-
haps the bank will provide tugs to handle
the traffic. Whether the bank is on a
floating pontoon or on shore the article
didn’t say, but it is pleasant to picture
a racing - yacht with high - raked masts
lowering sail as the skipper brings her
alongside the teller’s counter. I have
often seen a customer sail into a bank
intent on obtaining an overdraft and
drift out again looking not unlike a
remnant of the Spanish Armada.

Melbourne folk say, “How d'you do?’
Sydney folk say, “Howdy!”
Melbourne folk tiptoe, tiptoe,
But Sydney folk are rowdy.
Melbourne’s cultural attituda
Is quietly artistic;
Sydney art is coarse and crude :
Exhibitionistic!
Melbourne roofs divert the gales
From serene occasions ;
Sydney’s billow-up like sails
Over boisterous passions.
Melburnians’ heavenly flights begin
When Sydney folk are hell-borne,
For Sydney folk are black with sin
To expiate in Melbourne.

Christmas Eve, and the carollers
set-out from the church. It must
have been a sight: 25 singers in the
back of a great chugging lorry, pre-
sided over by the organist at the mighty
console of the church harmonium, with
only one of the two pumping-pedals
working and a treble A which,
mysteriously jiggered inside, moaned
every time you pushed the pedal. At
12.30 the carols (and the sound of the
organ) were still interrupting the mid-
night clear ... in one street, after we
finished singing, a woman rushed from
her doorstep and put a shilling on the
organ ; whether this was intended as
encouragement to the singers or as a
hint that the organ needed drastic
internal overhaul I don’t know. In
another street, groups of people, some
of them a bit under the weather, came
and listened silently and then clapped ;
and a man rushed up, fished in his
wallet and produced a ten-bob note. It
was all encouraging, and we finished-up
weary but rich ; but it was, I suppose,
nothing compared to the cheery little
incident elsewhere in the parish that very
night. The rector’s doorbell rang ; when
he answered it a dishevelled chap, sway-
ing and lurching, said, “I’ve been down
the church an’ said me prayers an’ I'm
o.k. now an’ [nearly overbalancing]
’ere’s me donation.” And pushed a
crumpled five-pound note at the rector.
I saw it next morning in the offertory-
plate.—“Dorian.”

reminds me that I was living in Cairo
at the time the Shah (then the Crown

Farouk’s sister in the spring of 1939.
Part of the celebrations was a race-
meeting at Heliopolis, the main event
of which was a mile race for a cup
presented by the bridegroom. The race
was duly run in a manner which would
have had the stewards of the A.J.C.
yelling for the police to arrest every
jockey taking part. I couldn’t grumble,
because my money was on the winner,
which paid a nice 4-to-l on the pari-

her said: “Now try backing into that

‘Hattie Hop”: Outsize postage-stamps
are not the modern novelty I had sup-
posed them to be. Browsing through a
volume of, The Bulletin for 1888 I came
across two drawings by Phil May which
reveal that history is merely repeating
itself. The first depicts a man about to
post a letter: “These stamps take an
awful lot of licking.” The second shows
an irate woman who has been kept wait-

"8.A.K.”: The modern insistence on

The present-day mum has an incredible
antipathy to the traditional abbreviations.
Call a Robert “Bob” in front of his
ma, and you’ll establish that fact. A
neighbor’s wife is a particularly placid
type, but she promptly squashed a
schoolmate’s affectionate shortening of
her son Douglas to “Douggie.” And the
modern Australian mother would as
soon brand her son on the forehead as
allow him to bear even the most healthy,
laudatory nickname. Which makes it all
the more inexplicable that there is a com-
plete about-face when it comes to her
daughters. Robertas become “Bobbies,”
Patricias, Pats,’ Jacquelines, “Jackies,’
so on. The only unvarying essential
seems to be that the nickname or
abbreviation must serve to remind the
male that even his names are no longer
sa * e from feminine acquisitiveness,

examine any suspicion of “bridgeman-

while I pull out

Now, why can’t you
agree that an ama-

wrote “Silent
Night”? From a
technical angle, this
carol is sheer dog-
gerel. For thinness
of invention, short-
age of harmonic in-
terest and for brazen
use of the dominant-
seventh chord it
takes the biscuit. The
melody is wholly based on three chords,
and in this respect it is no better than
those Moody-Sankey evangelical songs,
which today enjoy a popularity approach-
ing that of some carols. By and large,
tunes readily accessible to a large num-
ber of people are the melodies most
likely to remain. But the fact that a
tune is popular doesn’t necesarily mean
that it’s a good tune or that it was written
by a discerning musician.

interest these speech-days are held. I
attended one speech-day where the
schoolgirls ranged between six and 13.
They filed into the hall, crocodile-style,
heads bent, eyes lowered, lips set. When
they were seated on the raised tiers of
seats facing the hall I dared to wiggle
my fingers and beam approvingly at my
12-year-old. With the expression of a
hunted animal her eyes whipped away
from mine and, throughout the ensuing
two-and-a-half hours, dared not return.
Her explanation, when we had finally
left the school precincts, was: “Gosh,
we’ve been practising not wriggling or

ordinary evening-services; and at the
last service, at 10.30, there were 15
people. It shows that people consider
early church something of an event:
they get it over with and then spend
the rest of the day concentrating on
the really serious things of life, such
as poultry, pudding and a blessed after-
noon sleep. The organist, struggling to
inspire 15 voices, thinks only of sleep,
especially when, for the third time, he

to their hosts as their hosts are to them.
Saw a middle-aged, dowager-like woman
tipsily harassing a traffic-cop, lifting her
skirts and stamping her feet in' mock
flamenco, and making matador-passes
at the cars. The policeman, embarrassed
by the laughter of the increasing crowd
and obviously weighed-down by official
injunctions to be kind to tourists, im-
plored her to move on, while he tried
to get on with his job. At length he
spotted a senior officer, to whom he
stated his woe. Unhesitatingly the s.o.
made his plan. Advancing, he bowed
with portly gravity, and extended his
crooked arm. The tourist, gurgling with
delight at this so-Latin gallantry, linked
up with the proffered elbow and, when
last seen, they were sedately promenad-
ing down the street while the pointsman
mopped his brow, and the crowd ole’d.
BREAKING HIM IN
“Among unusual accidents of 1959 was that
of a bridegroom who tried to carry his 1601 b.
bride across the threshold of their new home
and broke his leg.”
Life’s one long risk, as all mankind
Has found since man first trod the
earth.
Hazards of quite a varied kind
Attend each one of us from birth.
Observe this cove :
In lists of love
Successfully he’d thrust-and-parried.
Good luck, he felt,
Within him dwelt
When he and she were duly married.
Their roof-tree reached, tradition called
On him gay duty to perform ;
Nor was that ’groom one whit appalled
At poundage well above the norm.
His bride he seized,
Lifted her, wheezed,
Staggered a yard; his biceps, rusted,
Cracked with the strain.
Down went the twain ;
Lobbing on him, his peg she busted!
You skinny ’grooms, this lesson heed:
If you must wed outside your weight,
Prepare beforehand for the need;
Why not a fork-lift for your mate ?
Don’t be a mug
And try to lug
Her round, to show you’ve got her
mastered.
Really, you wont
Have, mates, so don’t
Start married life by getting plastered !

A Man with More Than a Museum
Bob Mackie, Individualist
By RAY MITCHELL
At Surfers’ Paradise (Q.)
stands the Captain Cook
Museum, owned and
run by Bob Mackie, a
third-generation Australian of
Scots and Irish extraction, an
individual thinker, philosopher
and idealist with a shock of
iron-grey hair, a forthright
manner, an Irish love of the
blarney and a sincere faith in
himself and God.
“Put your faith in the hand
of God, my lad, and you can’t
go wrong. Now, take Captain
Cook. What a man he was!
The greatest man who ever
lived, was Cook. And he had
faith in himself and placed his
hand in the hand of God.”
Mackie idolises Cook. If
you’ll listen, he’ll tell you the
history of the man, his private
life, his wonderful seaman-
ship and his character. Before
you leave, you feel that Cook
is a vital human-being who
still is a force in world-affairs ;
not a man who was stabbed
by natives somewhere on one
of the Pacific islands.
“You see this medallion?”
asked Mackie. “There were
a hundred of these struck for
Captain Cook. Only a hun-
dred, and this is one of them.
I got that from Bert Latta.
He owns the bus-service,
Cronulla-Kurnell, Sydney. He
is the great-grandson of the
woman who brought this medal
to Australia. »
“You know, I was telling a
woman about Cook one day
and she said to me: ‘You know
a lot about Cook, don’t you?’
Then she told me who she
was: Miss Sylvia Corner. She
is the curator of the Whitby
Museum—Whitby was where
Cook came from—and she was
travelling around the world,
going over all the exact routes
Cook sailed on, picking up
data here and there. Qne day
she will write a complete book
on Cook —just as soon as she
has finished her travels.
“She was so impressed with
my museum that she gave me
a lot of material on Cook.
Look, I’ll show you. Now,
here are some etchings.”
Mackie went inside to his
private office and carefully
brought out a large volume.
“You see this?” he said.
“There are only three copies
in the world —one in the
Whitby Museum, one in Wel-
lington, New Zealand, and this
one here. Miss Corner gave
me that.”
Across the title-page of the
book were the words:
Voyages Round The World
Undertaken & Performed by Royal
Authority.
Captain Cook’s
First, Second, Third & East
Voyages
Undertaken by Order of his
Present Majesty.
The book is not dated, but
it was published during the
reign of George 111.
'T'he Captain Cook Museum
is a galaxy of material
connected with Australia and
the near islands, with a smat-
tering of stuff from other parts.
There is the complete story
of Ned Kelly in pictures, and
slides of Kelly from birth to
death. Copious notes on other
bushrangers are stacked in one
room. There are death-adders
and other snakes in bottles;
butterflies, birds, sharks’ jaws,
freaks, and a two : headed, six-
legged lamb; a fantastic
framed ornament entirely made
from shells; photographs,
relics and so many other things
that every time you enter the
museum you see items you
missed last time around.
Bob Mackie has copies of
the Magna Charta and the
Bill of Rights, and on these
he waxes eloquent. He cer-
tainly did so when his address'
was Kurnell, Sydney, and I
interviewed him there.
“The Cumberland County
Council,” he said, apropos of
those documents, “has cor-
rupted Torrens-title, and a
man’s home is no more his
castle than the sky.
“This octopus has been and
is backed by both Liberal and
Labor parties and has com-
pletely confounded the tenets
and principles of the Bill of
Rights and the Magna Charta.
“Were I a wealthy man I
would take these interfering
busybodies to the highest court
under British jurisprudence.
“My observations, at this
stage of life, after having
knocked around the world
twice, lead me to believe that
the worst factor in modern
living is interference with a
human-being’s national rights
to live according to basic prin-
ciples for which millions of
men have shed their blood, and
the sooner people cut the
rope from the rings of their
noses the better.
“Individualism. That’s the
answer, and that’s what’s
missing from life today.”
T>ob Mackie’s forebears
settled in Lithgow (N.S.W.).
Bob has some of their pioneer
spirit.
He has been around the
world twice. He began work
as a commercial artist with
Bernie Bragg. At 21 he was
a black-and-white artist with
the Sydney “Sun.” At 22 he
was a layout-man with the
Sydney “Daily Telegraph,”
when it was converted from a
broadsheet into a pictorial.
At 23 he worked his passage
to England in the engineroom
of the Barrabool. When he
arrived in London, he had two-
shillings.
He walked into Fleet Street,
and went into the art-room of
the “Westminster Gazette,”
because there were heaters in
that room and the weather was
cold. He looked at the work
in the room and “began to
interfere with it,” to use his
words.
A few minutes later he had
a job on the paper. This was
the paper which was once
edited by Charles Dickens.
Bob got a job as art-editor,
as the previous art-editor,
Edgar Middleton, had just
written a successful play,
“Potiphar’s Wife,” and had
quit his job. The editor of
the “Westminster Gazette” at
this time was Frank Hillier.
Later the paper was sold to
the “Daily News,” and 300
men were sacked. Only three
of the staff of the “Gazette”
were kept on with the “News.”
Bob was one of them.
Three years after his arrival
in London Bob was in U.S.A.
He stayed at the Hotel

children who left school before that age.
Just before Christmas the Crowther

first of these provisions in 1966, 1967 or

year above the Australian average—
£B6o in 1956-57 (the last year for which
details are available), compared with
£753. Most of the Canberra incomes,
of course, come from the pockets of all
taxpayers, who needn’t feel any sympathy
at the commission’s further disclosure
that the difference in favor of the A.C.T.
income-earners is partly offset by an
“apparent higher cost of living” com-
pared with State capitals and large coun-
try towns. Canberra amenities, also paid
for by the taxpayers, are mostly better
and more lavish than those available else-
where, travelling-costs between home and
work are not high, and property-values
are soaring.

Two famous Australian soldiers were
remembered in the naming of the two
landing-ships bought by the Army from
the U.S. The two vessels, which arrived
from Japan last week, bear the names
Brudenell White and Harry Chauvel.
Of 1000-tons displacement and 203 ft.
long, they can carry two or three
Centurion tanks. They’ll be based on
Chowder Bay, Sydney.

Hobart, after a break of 30 years, is
permitting picture-theatres to open on
Sunday nights. Hours are fixed so as
not to interfere with church-services ; no
theatre is to open its doors before 8.10

Prickly-pear, once thought to have
been brought completely under control,
is again causing concern in parts of
N. S. Wales. Lands Minister McMahon,
announcing the grant of an additional
£50,000 (the statutory grant is £30,000),
said the pest had made some properties
practically useless, and the spectacular
results achieved by the cactoblastis 30
years ago were most unlikely to be
repeated, as the “wonder grub” now had
many enemies. One, the shield bug, was
destroying cactoblastis in millions. The
Prickly Pear Destruction Commission
would spend the extra grant on new
equipment for prickly-pear eradication.

Sydney’s Green Belt has been taken-in
a few more notches. P. D. Hills, Minis-
ter for Local Government, announced on
Wednesday of last week that the “release”
figure of 46 sq.-miles which he gave the
previous week should have been 57-1
sq.-miles. This followed the claim of
R. D. L. Fraser, chief planning-officer
of the Cumberland County Council, that
the real figure should have been 75 sq.-
miles. Hills insists that sq.-miles
is the true figure, and that Fraser is
barking up the wrong tree.
Meanwhile, a police-inquiry is being
held into allegations by Walter Wearn,
a Sydney dentist, that he was approached
several weeks ago by someone who
solicited a bribe to secure the release
from the Green Belt of land owned by
him. The land about 220 acres at
North Rocks, near Parramatta—is in-
cluded in the released area. Its value
has been placed as high as million,
but Hills says this is absurd and that
the real figure would be more like
£300,000. Quite a green little paddock,
nevertheless. Wearn is an enterprising
and determined character who has
figured in the news in days gone by
through his efforts to raise the produc-
tivity of his land by using organic
fertilisers, efforts not always appreciated
by his near neighbors to the leeward.

According to “U.S. News and World
Report,” American chemical-manufac-
turers are feeling the pinch of foreign
competition in their home-market.
Imported vitamins and antibiotics are
underselling their U.S.-made counter-
parts in the U.S. market. The imports
are coming from Europe, Japan and
Australia. In many other lines U.S.
manufacturers, “whether selling at home
or abroad, are up against stiffer foreign
competition than at any time since
America came of age industrially.”

No. x lO Downing Street, the official
residence of the British Prime Minister,
is to be reconstructed. The present
facade is to be retained as much as pos-
sible and internal features of historic or
architectural importance, including panel-
ling and ornamental cornices of the
Cabinet-room and other principal rooms
will be preserved. The “major structural
overhaul” has been ordered because the
building is in sad need of repair; it
was built in the second half of the 18th
century. The reconstruction will also
extend to No. 11, the official residence
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
No. 12, occupied by the Chief Govern-
ment Whip. During the overhaul the
Prime Minister will live and work at the
Admiralty, in Whitehall.
Latest TV exposure comes from
Northern Ireland, where it has been
admitted that a batch of 40 convicts
whom viewers saw being farewelled on
Christmas-leave by the governor of a
jail were in reality warders dressed-up
as convicts, it having been feared that
the prisoners might be recognised and
so caused embarrassment. Next we’ll
be hearing that those photographs we

youngsters rushing out of the schoolyard
on break-up day don’t really depict
kiddies at all, but teachers who have

“Collins Street”:,. Forthright Judge
Fraser, of the Victorian Licensing Court,
has in successive weeks taken swipes at
the Carlton Brewery for the state of
one of its hotels, and at dreary wine-
saloons in general and their wine-com-
pany owners in particular. He has also
taken shots at breweries which get round
the law prohibiting those who brew beer
from retailing it, poorly-run country
pubs, and hotels which don’t supply meals
and accommodation. “It would be
easier to get into Pentridge after 6 p.m.
than into your hotel,” he told one appli-
cant. He has even criticised the exces-
sive number of Commercial, Shamrock,
Victoria, Railway and Junction hotels.
Recently Judge Fraser got back from
an overseas trip on which he studied
middle- and lower-class hotels. His
report, due in February, should be a
beaut.

“Mugga Way”: Date of the summit-
conference, in relation to that fixed for
the Prime Ministers’ talks in London,
may have some bearing on whether R. G.
Menzies is invited to be present at the
former as one of the advisers to Mac-
millan. It would be a gracious gesture
by Macmillan to invite Menzies, who did
a good deal of talking behind the scenes
to Eisenhower, Adenauer and de Gaulle
before the top-level get-together was
approved. His inclusion would also
suggest that the Commonwealth, rather
than merely Britain, was sharing in the

The Rockefeller Foundation, which
four years ago gave 250,000 dollars
towards the cost of the giant radio-
telescope the C.5.1.R.0. is building at
Forbes (N.S.W.), has just weighed-in with
a further gift of 107,000 dollars. The
mirror for the instrument —a dish-shaped
bowl 210 ft. in diameter and covered with
wire-mesh —is nearing completion in
Germany, and the concrete tower which
will support the bowl is under construc-
tion on the site. The telescope, which
is designed to pick-up radio-signals
“from the outermost fringes of the uni-
verse,” should be ready for work some-
time in 1961.
Other Rockefeller Foundation gifts to
the C.5.1.R.0. during 1959 were 100,000
dollars for the Divisions of Plant
Industry and Entomology in Canberra

Authority on bower-birds and author

“A.C.T.”: Tributes to the great War I
Australian war - historian have been
numerous lately, while Dr. Bean, for
his part, has been gradually with-
drawing from some of his activities.
One of the more impressive tributes
came in Canberra from A. W.
Bazley, in an address to the local
Historical Society. Since printed in
“Stand-To,” the journal of the A.C.T.
branch of the R.S.L., it was a story
worth recording—and by a man who
is himself worthy of note. As an
18-year-old junior clerk with Melbourne
“Argus” when Bean won a ballot for


Australian official war - correspondent
“Baz” was introduced to Bean by Archie
Whyte, of the “S. M. Herald,” and his
duties throughout the war were the begin-
ning of an active association of more than
30 years. His tale of Bean’s work and
tributes to his physical and moral
courage, and the story of how most of
the volumes of the war-history were
written at Tuggeranong, about 12 miles
from Canberra, are worthy of perman-
ent record. They are, quite unintention-
ally, a tribute also to the qualities and
character of Bazley, who’s now a dis-
tinguished member of the public service
in the national capital.

Marist Brothers’ High School at
Darlinghurst, Sydney, has produced so
many doctors named Flynn that it was
probably disappointed when Michael
John Flynn decided to become an
engineer, joining the Sydney Water
Board in 1937 and taking an engineering-
course as an external student with the
University of London.
World War II interrupted, however,
and Flynn, commissioned in the 7th Div.
Engineers, finished-up on the Burma
railway, where he became “parson,
priest and gravedigger” and later, at
Kanburi, i.c. of the “diet” kitchen, where
they resorted to all manner of devices
—such as boiling the heels of cattle for
jelly— to get nourishment for the troops.
The suffering he saw turned Flynn’s
thoughts to medicine, and when he finally
got back to Sydney—by way of Thailand,
Singapore and Japan —he studied at
Sydney Uni., graduated, and became resi-
dent m.o. at Parramatta Hospital. After
a spell in private practice he joined the
Joint Coal Board, and then, in 1957,
returned to his old boss, the Water
Board, as its chief medical officer.

“C.C.M.U.”: The late Prince Duleep-
sinhji’s habit of travelling incognito as
“Mr. Smith” was referred to in an
obituary. This name was not the Prince’s
choice, but that of his fellow under-
graduates at Cambridge. I met Duleep.
and the rest of the 1925 Cambridge
University XI in the pavilion at the
United Services ground, Portsmouth,
when the Varsity was playing Hamp-
shire or the Services. The pavilion was
a homely affair in which members and
players mixed freely. Duleep. had re-
moved his boots and was sitting with
his feet on the table. One of his team-
mates said, “Well, Smith, when you
return to India I expect you’ll have
dozens of slave-girls to wash your feet!”
I think the remark was made by R. J. O.
Meyer, a bowler, who later played for
Somerset. The story about Meyer was
that in his first match for Cambridge
his captain told him to bat carefully
and keep his wicket up. Meyer hit his
first ball for six!

ABORIGINALITIES
After a hectic evening ashore the
skipper steered an uncertain course
along the old Thursday Island jetty, and
then dropped into the drink in trying
to descend the non-existent ladder, he
having forgotten that he’d ordered the
ketch to be shifted to new moorings.
He was saved by Eseli and Wasam, two
crewboys, whose timely presence in the
water in anticipation of his taking the
dive was an instance of the quick but
erratic thinking of which the binghi
mentality is capable. In the same think-
ing, the idea of warning the skipper
before he took the plunge which made
rescue necessary just didn’t occur to
them.—“O. K. Lee.”

“Sack”: No doubt there is still no
news in dog biting man, but when man’s
other four-footed friend had a nip even
the “Sydney Morning Herald” gave it
3|in. and a bold headline. When the
prominent pacer Amazing Vale bit the
hand that fed him, it was no love-nicker ;
it completely removed the thumb of
trainer W. S. Smith. “The accident” was
twice mentioned, maybe by a reporter
who hadn't heard the one about the man
commiserating with a patient kicked by
a horse: “My accident? Accident be
damned! He did it on purpose!”

“L.R.P.”: Glad to take Bulletin
experts’ word for it that a noise won’t
make bees settle. My own experience
was a little inconclusive. It happened
many years ago, when we youngsters
sighted a swarm in flight. We grabbed
kerosene-tins and anything else that
would make a noise, and belted hard.
The result wasn’t what we expected.
The horse harnessed to the cart bolted ;
horses in the yard rushed to the corner
and fell over the fence ; the dogs took
after the cows ; and Dad took after us.
1 still don’t know if the swarm stopped,
and at the time I didn’t care.

“Bellfield”: I wonder whether any
descendants of Forby Sutherland exist in
England, and, if so, do they realise that
their ancestor left a name in Australia
that will never be obliterated? And yet
this humble seaman did nothing more
spectacular or noteworthy than die here
of tuberculosis. His name goes down
to posterity because he died at Botany
Bay and became the first Englishman
buried on Australian soil. An obelisk
at Kurnell marks the place of his burial,
and the rapidly-expanding town of
Sutherland perpetuates his name.

“Theo D. Lite”: “Tabba” (B.
2 /12/’59), mistaking the false-boil of
electric-jugs, thinks the water cools
quickly. Actually, the coiled element
boils the thin film of water touching
it, while the bulk of the water is still
only warm. If filled too full the jug
will boil over, and still not reach boiling-
point. The secrets of use are, firstly,
to leave about 3in. of freeboard, and
then to train your ear to the sound of
the real boil, which is relatively quiet.

“Villefair”: Is “0.W.W.” sure that the
vast quantities of vanilla used by his
babbling-brook were not devoted to a
more personal purpose than toning-down
aromas from the swill-bin (B. 9/12 / ’59)?
The most extreme case I’ve ever beheld
of blind, plastered, stinko-profundo was
exhibited by the cook of a construction-

direct result of wrapping himself around
about half-a-case of essence of vanilla,
then he must have had some secret addi-

“Joanne”: After a hailstorm over-
Newcastle (N.S.W.), districts variously
reported the size of the hail. In one area

people described the jagged pieces as

“Blood”: “The Seven Somethings” (B.
9/12/’59) recalls that more than 50 years
ago Queensland had its “Seven Wonders
of the West.” There was the Eulo Queen.
The courthouse was packed the day she
had-up her second husband, one Victor,
less than half her age, for assault,
threatening her life, and using filthy and
indecent language. The Bench —two
Jaypees—found the charges proved and
fined Victor £25, in default three months.
The Queen paid the fine —and kicked
him out. A few days later the police in
Cunnamulla arrested him for bigamy.
There was the Jack-in-the-Rocks pub
between Adavale and the Cliffs with its
cemetery at the back tenanted by those
who died in the horrors. An old woman
kept it; she also kept a husband and
son, well under her boot. Once when
away for the day she left a jar of rum
in the bar and instructions that for
every nip taken out a shilling had to
go into the till, the till being a slot in
the bar-counter with a padlocked box
underneath. When she came back the
men were full, the jar was empty, and
the till held a two-bob piece. The men
got the mother of a hiding, although they
swore by the Holy Father himself that
two-bob had gone into the till for every
two nips taken out of the jar. And so
THE SILENT BIRDS
One thing that moves me time and time
again
is the way, all of a sudden, all the birds
for miles and miles around begin to sing,
and then cease, just as instantaneously,
as if some secretly transmitted sign
had made them silence their pervading
song.
It startles me. with that same ecstasy
as holds me unmoving, choked and
breathless, when
the movement of an unexpected breeze
ripples the surface of a waterhole, and
then
passes, leaving sky and clouds and trees
mirrored in tranquil water once again.
Listen ! In every tree birds cease to sing.
Not one calls, nor even stirs a wing.
It makes me wonder if I'll ever know
which imperishable moment moves me
more :
when breathless quiet falls on . all the
bush,
or when those bird-songs burst out as
before.

so meant expulsion. The club, I’m told,
wound-up when eventually there was
“Prenez garde! The fall-out's started !”
only the Dean left. Can anyone remem-
ber the other three wonders?
* * * ♦
“Tabba”: Those steel corset-ribs (B.
25 /11 / ’59) were coveted by rustic larri-
kins. A 6in. length of tube with the top
cut open for about half its length and a
springy horseshoe of corset-rib inserted,
became an effective pea- and pebble-
projector. The rear leg of the horseshoe
was fixed at the back of the pistol, and
the forward leg drawn back along the
open tube, until the steel formed a circle ;
its own tension held it in place. The
projectile was put in and the rear leg of
the steel drawn back like a trigger until
the front leg escaped with a twang,
shooting the pellet across the classroom
with a fair amount of accuracy.
TAuring a vice-regal inspection in Fiji
of Girl Guides, Salitelu, our 1 orres
Strait Island housegirl, who was leader
and standard-bearer, stood stock-still
until it had finished, then fled in the
direction of the bungalow. Knowing
something was amiss, my wife hot-footed
it after her. Examination showed the
girl’s golden-brown belly criss-crossed by
ugly weals. The scorpion that caused
them was still in her shimmy—she had
unflinchingly borne the bites rather than
“put on a show”!—“Laetitia.”
“Berne”: The sun shone warmly
through the farmhouse window on to
a fishbowl, and through the fishbowl,
which acted as a burning-glass, on to a
transistor-radio. Unfortunately, just as
the transistor began to smoke, someone
noticed it and moved it.
* * *
“Bundalinga”: Does any other road in
Australia bear so many names as that
following Blaxland, Lawson and Went-
worth across the Blue Mountains?
Officially the Great Western Highway,
it is variously called the “Bathurst Road,”
“Western Road,” “West Road,” “Western
Highway,” “Great West (-ern) Road,”
with sections known as “Old Bathurst
Road” and “Sydney Road.” Now there
is a move to call it the “Olympic High-
way,” as part of the Sydney-Melbourne
route alternative to the Hume Highway.
A Blue Mountains organisation is trying
by usage to have a section of the old
road known as “The Pioneer Way” in
memory of the people who opened up
the inland. Supporting its claims, this
organisation is beautifying sections of
the road.
* * * *
“Ernel”: Although the oldest cow
ever sold in the Horsham (Vic.) yards,
the 28-year-old milker was in such con-
dition —one man remarked “She looks
like Sabrina!” —that the auctioneer had
no difficulty in getting £37 Is. for her.
Even more complimentary, probably,
will be the label, perhaps “Choice Veal,”
on the tins she was destined to fill.

“Do-it-yourself”: Teenager son was
constantly plugging for an electric-drill.
Mum, visualising the built-in-cupboards
she would have, played along . . . until
she spoke of the cupboards and was told:
“Aw gee, Mum, 1 want it to polish my
motorbike!”

And so Priestley found birds a bit
light-on here!
Two days after we set-up camp in
a gidyea scrub near Clermont (Q.) the
birds started drinking from the dog’s
tin. Shaded by sandalwoods, the tin was
no more than 20ft. from the tucker-fly,
but nothing disturbed them. The friar-
birds (leatherheads) came first, then the
noisy-miners (mickeys). Four spotted
bower - birds added their snarls to the
uproar and argued with the banana-birds.
An olive-backed oriole made a fleeting
visit, but he was driven-off by the others.
Three kinds of butcher-birds —the grey,
the pied and the black-backed—sang for
their supper.
Two magpies worked every day until
late evening carrying scraps to their
nestlings, and all. day long a pair of
mistletoe-birds flashed from one clump
of mistletoe to another singing their
sweet, insistent song. In the early
mornings and in the evenings king-
parrots, red-winged parrots and Blue
Mountains added gay color. Grey-
crowned babblers ran along the nearby
road and galahs grazed in flocks. A
dollar-bird kept to himself on a tall dead
tree.
The thicker scrub was full of double-
bars and blue wrens, and a plumed frog-
mouth slept the days away nearby. But
one regular drinker remains unidentified,
despite close study of An Australian
Bird Book. A slim bloke with a swallow-
like tail, and about 6in. long, he had a
head strongly marked in black-and-grey
stripes extending like a hood at the back.
Remainder of the back was brownish-
grey, with the whole of the underpart
from throat to tail pale-grey ; his bill,
eyes and feet were black. He hopped
up trees and on the ground, and had a
sustained trilling note. Anyone know
him?
I. Q.


Old Bore’s Almanack for 1960
[As forecast with his typically infallible inaccuracy by Bo.]
Jan.: At a Foothills Conference called
as a preliminary to a Higher Slopes
Conference which it was felt was an
essential prelude to the Summit Con-
ference, a sound will be heard like that
of a delegate crying, and it will trans-
pire that it was India’s Krishna Menon
laughing. Communist China’s Marshal
Pong Hi will be gonged on a national
quiz-session when he can't explain what
a “cadre” is. A short-haired woman
with a heavy masculine voice and a long-
haired man who speaks in a light
soprano will be elected president and
vice-president respectively of the newly-
formed Kindness To Prisoners Associa-
tion. Asked by an admirer what in-
spired the subject of the painting that
won him first prize in a contemporary-
art competition an eviscerated cat
hanging across an upturned garbage-can
in a slum-alley—an artist will attribute
it to his “deep love of the beauties of
nature.” In a conciliatory speech Presi-
dent Nasser will describe General Abdul
Kassem as the “Washington of Iraq.” In
a competition to find a voice with the
greatest roaring capacity, a regimental
sergeant-major will fill sixth plade, the
first five going to Sydney traffic-police-
men.
Feb. : Sheikh lbrihim Bismillah ben
Wassail el Wallah of Kuwait will get
£4sm. sterling in oil-royalties for the
month. He will set aside £44,885,000
for new palaces, acquisition and fitting-
out of 300 new wives and 700 concubines,
and a fleet of platinum-bladed helicopters
and diamond-studded Cadillacs; the
other £115,000 he will earmark for im-
provement to the population’s living-
standards. Following announcement that
a plant-hybridist has succeeded in raising
a pea-plant which has square peas, a
well-known radio-comedian, depressed at
this threat to his oldest and favorite gag,
will try to end it all by hacking at his
jugular with a restaurant-knife, and will
succeed only in further blunting the
implement. The 70-year-old millionaire
Tommy Manville will marry for the
14th time, and his 18-year-old bride will
tell a press-conference that jffie loves
Tommy “for himself alone.” TTie Kind-
ness To Prisoners Association will
demand that TV-sets be provided in
prisoners’ cells “to make a burdensome
life tolerable for these lonely unfortu-
nates.” An amateur fisherman will lose
his top-set out of the dinghy, and the
next mullet he hauls in won’t contain
the missing crockery.
Mar. : The new Burmese Cabinet will
comprise U Nu, I Nu, E Nu, U Saw,
1 Saw, E Saw, Toe Saw and Rip Saw.
General Kassem in a conciliatory speech
will refer to President Nasser as “a com-
bination of Alexander, Hannibal and
Napoleon.” President Soekarno of
Indonesia will have his photo, taken with-
out his fez and nobody will recognise
him. The Council of Churches will
protest to the N.S.W. Premier against
the holding of the Royal Show on Good
Friday, and the Premier will promise to
give their views “his most sympathetic
consideration.” Hearty laughter will
shortly afterwards be heard in the
purlieus of Macquarie Street. China’s
top military planner, Marshal Wun
Bung Wing, will announce that hence-
forth the defence-forces will abandon the
Western-style rank of lieut.-colonel as
distinct from full-colonel, instead, the
lower rank will be known as “half-full
colonel," which is more in keeping with
the national dignity. A man from
Jacksonville, Fla., will obtain a divorce
“If’s disgraceful the Way schools are overcrowded these days!”
on the grounds of extreme cruelty, his
wife having consistently refused to listen
to his office stories.
April: There will be a skirmish be-
tween an Israeli patrol and an Egyptian
brigade on the Sinai Peninsula. The last
heard of the Gyppos will be that they
were still making excellent speed as they
tore through Khartoum on their way to
points south, and President Nasser will
subsequently announce that his “brave
task-force had attained all its objectives.”
Dr. Fidel Castro will rouse a mass-rally
in Havana to fury when he compares
the lot of the poor have-not Cubans
with that of the “idle, cigar-smoking
American tycoons.” The out-of-hand
mob will then grab the entire stocks of
Havana cigars from the capital’s ware-
houses and make a huge bonfire of them
to spite the Yanks. Seven men will set
a record of 16 hours of “togetherness”
in a telephone-booth and will be rushed
to hospital and put in oxygen-tents;
after recovering they will all manage to
raise sickly smiles and say that “it was
worth every minute of it.” The R.A.S.
will announce that the Show crowd on
Good Friday set a new record.
May: Sheikh lbrihim Bismillah ben
Wassail el Wallah of Kuwait will order
from England a complete dry-cleaning
plant, and he will explain that it is not
for clothes but for his own use, this
method of personal hygiene being, in
his view, much more desirable and
modern than the old-fashioned bath,
which he had never had occasion to use,
anyway. A top amateur tennis-player
will be made bankrupt, and his State-
ment of Affairs will disclose that last
year he was only able to make £4OOO
from the game. A Hollywood director
will achieve universal fame, including
a fan-mail from Port Said, by setting
the first full-length smellie, a crime-
drama, in a blood-and-bone factory. A
six-year-old boy from Tucson, Arizona,
will shoot his father because he wouldn’t
allow him to smoke “reefers.” Professor
Battski, the famous Soviet scientist, will
reveal that he has developed a plan to
draw the moon closer to the earth by
means of giant magnets, so that in place
of the low and high tides as at present,
the earth can enjoy high and higher
tides.

TASMANIAN BOARD MILLS, LTD.
Tn the midst of balance-sheet
wreckage and relics which
tell the story of Tasmanian
Board Mills’ unhappy venture
into the manufacture of paper-
board, over the last couple of
years an attractive sapling has
revealed itself, springing-up in
a fashion that promises, if it
continues to flourish as it has
begun, worth-while timber for
those patient enough to hang
onto the shares for a few years.
Even acquisition of the
shares at the present price of
6s. could be interesting. But
the venture is one for the
experienced and sophisticated
speculator with a clear mind
as to the possibilities.
After publication of the
accounts for 1958-59 (they were
dated November 5), with their
rather happier appearance, the
£1 ord. shares recovered to Bs.
Then at the annual meeting on
November 20 chairman K. C.
Holyman told shareholders
that, “failing fortuitous cir-
cumstances,” it would be some
years before Tasmanian Bbard
Mills could pay a dividend, and
the scrip slipped back to its
present 6s.
Sawmilling and Timberlands
But the interesting fact
remains that for 1958-59 net
profits of the co., without pay-
ing tax, were £136,385. Mr.
Holyman told shareholders at
the annual meeting that results
for the current year were about
parallel with those of the
corresponding period of last
year, and profits for the first
quarter were satisfactory.
Most of the co.'s profits these
days come from sawmilling,
timber-processing and similar
activities. The basis of the
business, before it ventured into
paper-board, was the well-
established Launceston (Tas.)
firm of K. D. Atkins, Ltd., which
had subsidiaries in Melbourne,
Sydney and Adelaide. It owns
timber-lands as well as its mill-
ing and warehousing assets.
111-fated Board Venture
The K. D. Atkins concern
sponsored Tasmanian -Board
Mills, Ltd., which was incor-
porated on February 27, 1946,
and which made an issue of
500,000 £1 ords. to the public
in February, 1949. Its first
object was to take-over its
sponsoring co. for 180,000
ords. and 50,000 5 p.c. cum.
prefs. With an original “pilot”
issue of 10,000 ords., subscribed
capital in 1949 became 690,000
£1 ords. and 50,000 5 p.c. prefs.
By June 30, 1953, the ord.
issue had risen to 1,320,000,
and total paid capital to
£1,370,000. It has not altered
since.
In 1954 the board-mill
came into production, and from
the start it operated at a loss:

Losses were so heavy and the
outlook so unpromising
that the board-mill was closed-
down on April 30, 1955, and
the board-machine and aux-
iliary equipment sold to Aus-
tralian Paper Manufacturers,
Ltd.
At June 30, 1955, trading
losses and the loss on sale of
the paper-board assets totalled
£826,787 (£580,810 was debited
as the loss on the board
section).
At this point the bank over-
draft soared to £1,601,233,
compared with £749,015 two
years earlier, and was well in
excess of paid capital.
But even in this disastrous
year the timber section operated
at a profit of £117,193. Still,
the directors’ claim in May,
1955, that earnings from the
timber section would eventu-
ally offset the loss on the board-
mill seemed valiant (at the
time), to say the least.
In 1955-56 an overall profit
of £128,630 was shown, not
“I had a ring from the office. They wanted to know
if you were ill.”
allowing for any taxation
because of losses in preceding
years.
For 1956-57 there was a
trading loss of £29,559, blamed
on difficult conditions in the
Australian native-timber indus-
try and to standing-charges and
interest relating to residual
assets of the container-board
division which had not been
passed-over at the time of the
sale.
For 1957-58 net trading
profit was £33,558. No tax
was charged, but the interest-
bill was £47,556.
In 1958-59 net profit from
trading (again no tax) was
£135,488, after charging
£44,704 of interest.
Overdraft Down From
£1,601,233 to £747,992
Helped by proceeds of the
s^ e °f the paper-board divi-
sion, by reductions in the
p.-and-l. debit from £826,787
in 1955 to £531,044 last year,
and to some reductions in
stocks and debtors, the bank-
overdraft has been brought
down from £1,601,233 in 1955
to £747,992 at last balance-
day. Other liabilities have
shown a reduction over the
same period. The improvement
has gone on steadily during
the past four years, and is
clearly shown in the balance-
sheet tabulation on page 21.
The co. has separated its
residual paper-board assets
from the active assets in the
balance-sheet, and they figure
at a total of £506,665. About
a third of the paper-board
building is let for £9878 a year,
Meantime, interest at 5 p.c.
on the debt represented by
these redundant or moribund
assets would amount to over
£25,000 a year, and the board
correctly points out that stand-
ing-charges on these residual

assets continue to be a heavy
burden on the company.
20.6 p.c. on Market-value
Bearing in mind that the loss
on sale of the paper-board
assets was £580,810, and that
the p.-and-l. debit at last
balance-day stood at £531,044,
the extent to which further
profit-earning will remain tax-
free will partly depend on what
portion of the paper-board loss
was attributable to the liquida-
tion of stocks and stores rather
than fixed assets.
Assuming that accumulated
trading losses are close to being
wiped-out by subsequent pro-
fits, last year’s disclosed earn-
ings, if they bore tax at 7s. 6d.
in the £, would have dropped
to about £84,000.
After allowing for pref. divs.
of £2500 a year, this represents
a net earning-rate of 6.1 p.c. on
ordinary capital, or 20.6 p.c.
on a market-price of, say, 6s.
per ord. share.
If £BO,OOO (after tax) a year
were earned for 10 years, in
the absence of any need for
greater working-capital the
overdraft could be wiped-out
and the p.-and-l. debit and
other intangibles eliminated.
This would still leave the other
liabilities, and the paper-board
residual assets in at their
dubious book - value of
£506,665.
Inflation “Hedge”
But if one is prepared to
regard the purchase of shares in
Tasmanian Board Mills as a
long-term speculation, the pro-
position is one with intriguing
possibilities, especially in view
of the fact that inflation, creep-
ing or otherwise, would tend
to lighten the debt-burden and
resuscitate dormant or mori-
bund assets.
The timber business is sub-
ject to activity in the building-
trade and to other fluctuating
factors, but it would appear
that the timber division of
Tasmanian Board Mills is a
virile one, even when carrying
a burden of interest which
belongs really to the inopera-
tive or now non-existent board-
mill.
Two things in particular to
be noted among the assets of
Tasmanian B.M. are (/) the
increase from £53,531 (1952)
to £130,189 (1959) in the book-
value of “Timber-lands, leases
and roadways (at cost —less
amortisation)” apparently with
the approval of the A.N.Z.
Bank ; (2) the likelihood of
the original assets of the
timber division being in at a
conservative valuation. It will
be seen in the p.-and-l. table
that over the past three years
sales of capital-assets have
shown profits.
To the long-term investor
the absence of ord. dividends
may be no handicap if he
knows that his capital-asset is
being built-up.
If the ords. can be restored
to par over 10 years the average
annual capital-increment in
buying at 6s. now would be 23
p.c. p.a. flat. There is six years’
arrears on the pref. shares,
aggregating £15,000. But pref.
divs. are not a heavy item, either
as an accumulation or an
annual charge.
On the board of Tasmanian
Board Mills, Ltd., are K. C.
Holyman (chairman), K. D.
Atkins, C. S. Gibson and R. J.
McArthur.
Although chairman Holy-
man at the annual meeting on
November 20 discouraged
hopes of an early dividend, he
did say that “the company’s
resources were being substan-
tially strengthened, and the
directors had confidence in the
trading future.” Which seems
to be supported by the fore-
going analysis.

John Darling and Son
Suspension of dealings in the
shares of Spillers, Ltd., on
London ’Change on December
21, following rumors of a take-
over bid by Allied Bakeries
(the Weston group) and a
strong rise in the shares from
555. 6d. to 68s. over two weeks,
ended with a denial on the
same day by the Spillers board
of any takeover negotiations, a
similar denial being elicited
from Ranks and Unilever, the
other possible takeover parties.
But the Spillers board at
the same time announced a
one-for-two bonus-issue follow-
ing a revaluation of property
and plant, and promised a 7|
p.c. final div. on the new capital,
which in effect means a lift
from last year’s 10 p.c. to
13| p.c. Profits for the current
year so far are said to be a
“modest improvement” on
those for 1958-59.
Spillers are one oY the three
large flourmilling groups in the
United Kingdom, with net
assets of over £26 million, and
a last disclosed annual profit of
over £l3 million (all figures
sterling).
Australian interest in the
Spillers episode is rather
faraway and indirect:
Spillers in 1958 took-up
£375,000 (Aust.) of ord.
capital (in 10s. stock-units) in
John Darling and Son (Aust.),
Ltd., the old-established Vic-
torian and N.S.W. flourmillers.
John Darling now has a paid
capital of £1,418,718 in
2,250,000 10s. ords. and
293,718 6 p.c. £1 cum. prefs.
In addition, there are £120,000
of 6 p.c. convertible notes due
for conversion (at holder’s
option) in 1963, £525,000 due
in 1968, and £150,000 due
(without option) in 1973.
Throughout the world the
flourmilling business is becom-
ing more and more diversified,
and apparently Darling’s
regarded the link with Spillers
as a justifiable move on a
“know-how” or other basis.
Darling’s have been moving
energetically into the baking
trade, and at the date
of the last annual meet-
ing (January 28, 1959) had
set-up a new subsidiary in
N.S.W. —Cannongate Pty.—
which operates seven bakeries
in Sydney’s western suburbs.
A modern bakery was to have
been put-up at Seven Hills
during the second half of 1959,
and the top management of
Cannongate visited Spillers in
order to look at the latest in
U.K. baking practices.
Other bakery moves by the
co. in N.S.W. over the past
12 months have been the
acquisition of interests in
Narrabeen Bakeries Pty. and
Illawarra Bakeries.
In July of 1958 Darling’s
also invested £470,864 (a 49
p.c. interest) in Austral
Bakeries Pty., Melbourne, and
subsequently increased its in-
vestment to £522,412. The
Austral concern has recently
extended its bakery-chain.
Heavy capital-expenditure
on bakeries is anticipated “at
the appropriate time.” Good
results are expected from these
new ventures, but the board
does not look for spectacular
results immediately—the full
benefits will take a number of
years to develop.
New accounts are due from
Darling’s any day now.
In 1957-58 earnings were
equal to 10.6 p.c. on ord.
capital, and an 8 p.c. dividend
was paid. But earnings and
assets appear to be conserva-
tively stated, and the financial
position had not been at all
strained by the new develop-
ments up to September 30„
1958.
For the first half of the cur-
rent year turnover increased,
but because of keen competi-
tion and other factors profit
did not keep fully in step with
growing sales. But new
methods are being employed,
including bulk-delivery of flour,
and it is the long-term pros-
pects of John Darling which
look most attractive, especially
when it become's possible to
bake bread on standardised
factory lines under conditions
more favorable to the consumer
as well as to the baker.
Shell
'T’he centenary of the drilling

the occasion for the publica-
tion of much gush and (often
inaccurate) blurb ; but it has
produced, also, a few really
readable volumes covering the
development of the petroleum
industry and recounting the
activities of some of its notable
personalities.
One of these books
was recently reviewed (B.
18/11/ ’59), and the latest
deals, also, almost exclusively,
with the activities of a -single
organisation the Royal
Dutch/ Shell group. In both

very considerable help from the
companies concerned.
In Oil Is Where You Find It
(Harrap), Edward Ward
devotes much of his space to
the records of Shell employees,
mostly now retired, whom he
has interviewed personally ; he
includes, also, several chapters
describing—lucidly and easily
understandable by the layman
—such varied operations as
land-leasing, royalty-contracts,
geological and geophysical
prospecting and interpretation,
housing, refinery-construction,
market - forecasts, petro-
chemicals and the threat of
atomic energy to oil-consump-
ti oo -
The men whose professional
life-histories are recounted
are given fictitious names and
remain to some degree anony-
mous “because the many
people prefer it that way,”
although this anonymity is
easily pierced by anyone with
a knowledge of the specific
occupations dealt with.
“Hindson,” for instance, will
be recognised even by those
whose contact with the oil
game is limited to Port
Moresby cocktail-parties ; the
more knowledgeable reader will
suspect, however, that episodes
more strictly belonging to other
men have been added to his
earlier history. Such easy iden-
tification is possible, also, in
the case of most of the other
biographical sketches.
“Piet Vandersteen, a senior
geologist at The Hague,” is
right on the target where he
states that the worst type of
country to work in is the rain-
forest. With the advent of air-
conditioned caravans, the desert
has lost its relatively minor
discomfort; it has also limited
the amount of work done.
His opinion, however, that
without a coverage of air-
photographs the geologist in
rain-forest areas had “to feel
his way like a dumb ant in the
grass” must be attributed to
lack of appreciation of the
work done with little more
equipment than a hand-com-
pass and a pair of good legs
combined with stamina and
“gumption.” One of the weak-
nesses of present-day structure-
interpretation from air-photo-
graphs is due to the fact that
the interpreter has not been
forced to traverse, on foot, at
least two of the obscured
gullies (where such exist) indi-
cated on each photograph. The
elimination of this admittedly
slow process has been known
to reduce seriously both the
speed and accuracy of inter-
pretation in new areas,
“Vandersteen” is also in
error where he suggests that
rain-forest ticks limit their
attention to the legs; unfor-
tunately, they attack other less-
treatable parts of the body,
He is also hard on native tribes,

What would the august
Antipodean group of anti-
abstract painters have to say
about the work of Roy Bizley,
currently on show at Mel-
bourne’s Gallery A?
We know what they said
recently about abstract art in
general: that it hardly deserves
the name “art” ; and that it rep-
resents death to the living
image.
However, can Bizley’s work
be truly called abstract? Has
it really no kinship with the
world as recorded by the eye?
Or is it merely, as most of his
critics seem to think, a conjec-
ture of the artist’s mind?
In the opinion of the present
writer Bizley’s current show,
though one can readily imagine
its failing to win the approval
of the conventional Antipo-
dean, is nevertheless largely de-
pendent on figurative resem-
blances for any aesthetic value
it might have.
Does one really have to look
very far for the source of
power in the glowing, warm
color-arrangements of his silk-
screen prints? The forms of
Nature may be absent from
them, but the accents are surely
not. So also with his oils, in
which. incidentally; a touch of
Ivor Hitchen may be here and
there discerned.
Bizley’s gouaches are less suc-
cessful. It is perhaps in his
intaglio prints that we find
the finest achievements in the
exhibition. Here is a strength
and subtlety of line and a
vitality of texture that are too
often lacking in his other works.
Accompanying this exhibi-
tion—as with all other exhibi-
tions at this enterprising new
gallery —is an imaginatively
conceived little catalogue con-
taining a perceptive, yet some-
times vague and even contra-
dictory (in the use of terms
such as “structural truths,”
“abstract,” “tragic” and
“romantic”), appreciation of
Bizley’s work by Lenton Parr.
In the matters of discipline
and craftsmanship both Mar-
garet A. Michie (a 17-year-old
girl who is holding her first
one-“man” show at the Athe-
naeum, and who has been given
a fatherly caning by local
critics) and the pupils of the
National Gallery Art School
(whose annual exhibition may
be seen in the gallery’s print-
room) could profit from a visit
to the Bizley exhibition.
Miss Michie, who says she
paints with her fingers, has
declared herself a modernist-
hating traditionalist. At best
her work is fresh and atmo-
spheric—as in “Springs,” “Re-
servoir” and “Hills and Dales”
—but at its worst it is simply
amateurish.
The National Gallery exhibi-
tion shows a curious muddle of
attitudes to “modernism” and
“representationalism.” The
result in most cases is an inar-
tistic sort of halfway house.
Among the most impressive
entries are those by David
Gillison (winner of a £lOOO
travelling-scholarship), Kenneth
McFadyen, Janet Bird, R.
Garlick, A. Sutton and M.
Ritter.

U.S. Praise of Australian
Art
The Matson Lines’ travel-
ling exhibition of Australian
art has been well received by
newspaper critics in ,San
Francisco. Alfred Franken-
stein, of the “San Francisco
Chronicle,” described the show
as “full of vitality, life and
invention”:
“Many points of view
characteristic of modern Euro-
pean and American painting .
find counterparts here. One
immediately sees parallels
between Peter Laverty and
Vieira da Silva, James Gleeson
and Hans Hofmann, Stanislaus
Rapotec and Franz Kline,
John Coburn and Adolph
Gottlieb, Elwyn Lynn and
Jean Dubuffet, Roy Fluke and
Mark Tobey.
“To point out these parallels
is not to accuse the Australians
of imitation ; it is merely to
suggest what some of these
unfamiliar painters resemble.
Every one of them is a highly
individual artist, and so are
such less readily classifiable
people as George de Olzanski,
Judy Cassab, Eric Smith,
Ralph Balson and Charles
Bush.
“Bush’s ‘Melbourne’ gives
you a better idea of what at
least one part of Australia
looks like and feels like than
all the rest of the paintings in
the show put together, but if
I were awarding prizes here,
the gold medal would go to
the abovementioned James
Gleeson, whose highly abstract
‘Landscape’ is as brilliant as
it is complex.
“To be a conservative artist
these days it to bear a heavy
cross. The conservative’s
technique must really be
perfect and his perception
extraordinary. There are no
Andrew Wyeths here, but there
are some very accomplished
conservative works by Hal
Missingham, Lance Solomon,
Douglas Dundas, and above
all, Ronald Steuart and Robert
Campbell.”
About the six landscapes in
Western styles by members
of the aboriginal Aranda tribe
Frankenstein writes:
“Their bright little water-
colors would go well on travel-
folders, but if the Arandas
are responsible for any of the
aboriginal Australian art one
sees in primitive collections
their acculturation is one of
the real tragedies of modern
times.”
A. J. Bloomfield, of the
“San Francisco Call-Bulletin,”
under the heading “Sophisti-
cated Work fiom Down
Under” writes:
“I was particularly taken with
a number of canvases which
combine elements of repre-
sentation and abstraction. For
instance, J. Carington Smith’s
beautifully atmospheric ‘Night
Shadows,’ with the coloring
reminiscent of John Piper;
Wallace Thornton’s powerful
and touching double-image
portrait and abstraction ‘Fran-
cesca with Lute’; Charles
Bush’s marvellously free and
animated ‘Melbourne’;
Frederic Bates’ reflection-filled
montage of buildings and trees,
‘York Street . . . Winter . . .
Dusk’ and Carl Plate’s ‘Stock-
yard’ with its turning of the
buckin’ bronco into abstract
expression!'stic slash.
“Perhaps the most adven-
turous of the Australians is
Elwyn Lynn, who has mixed
gauze with his paint to build
up a crusty, swizzling totemic
abstraction which is only a
few steps away from ugliness
but has immense sensuous
appeal.”
The exhibition closed in San
Francisco on January 3 and
will open in Los Angeles on
January 26.

“Travelling Abstracts’’
The r .deep blush of The
Bulletin cover was certainly
appropriate for the December
16 issue. The Sundry Shows
review of “Travelling Ab-
stracts” refers to John Coburn
having four “pieces” in this ex-
hibition, thus making a “show
that will lack perspective.”
John Coburn has two paint-
ings and I have two. In fact,

neatly lettered Gill Sans (yin.

from this, if the critic could

had better forget the motto
“Australia for the White Man.”

Films
“On the Beach”
This somewhat perplexing
Stanley Kramer screen-transla-
tion of Nevil Shute's best-sell-
ing novel is an urgent warning
—an argument for pacifism in
world affairs, a plea for sanity
in the face of continued nuclear
tests and the appalling possi-
bility of an inter-global war.
It is 1964. There has been
some sort of push-button war
that nobody knows much about.
The Northern Flemisphere and
most of the Southern have been
devastated. Melbourne, one of
the last outposts of civilisa-
tion, waits, suicide-pills at the
ready, for a deadly cloud of
radiation steadily creeping
southwards.
The thought of this ever
becoming a reality is, of course,
horrifying; and a film which
sets out earnestly to fight
against it is to be applauded.
But it must be sustained by
more than good intentions. It
must, above all, be convincing.
A second visit to the Regent
Theatre, Melbourne, where the
film had its Australian pre-
miere, failed to dislodge this
reviewer’s original impression
that Stanley Kramer had not
conveyed the tremendous moral
import and dread hopelessness
of his theme anywhere near as
effectively and constructively
as he might have.
In terms of camera technique
and visual spectacle Kramer
and his crew have done some
marvellous work ; but to what
end? Choosing restraint and
quiet understatement, offset
occasionally by a sudden
shattering blast of visual or
aural imagery, Kramer de-
liberately avoids what most
people thought he would in-
clude : scenes of panic and
despair and destruction; the
horrible effects of radiation
(there is not one death or any
appreciable evidence of critical
illness); and the suggestion
“All right—if you insist, I'll use a brush for the
tiddly bits. "
that anyone would crack
morally under the strain.
The approach codld really
have worked wonders. But it
simply does not. One doubts
whether this is really the way
things would be. The emotional
impact diminishes, and the
effectiveness of the message is
fatally diluted.
Worse still, Kramer seems
to have been in two minds
about his leading characters:
whether to reveal the tragedy
through them, or simply in its
own starkly impersonal terms.
Submarine - commander
Gregory Peck is at all times
unbelievably sympathetic and
heroic. The same goes more-
or-less for the young Australian
couple (Anthony Perkins and
Donna Anderson), the scientist
(Fred Astaire) and the tippling
Frankston beauty (Ava
Gardner). Their contribution
to the intensity and significance
of this terrible fable and its
implied moral is almost neglig-
ible.
One looked desperately to
the dialogue for an idea, an
argument, for life, for any-
thing And again one found
the same bewildering lack of
imagination from the man who
produced such memorable
pieces as “Death of a Sales-
man,” “The Champion” and
“The Defiant Ones.”

“The House I Live In”
The brilliance of this Rus-
sian film lies in its simplicity.
It is the story of a group of
people living in a Moscow
apartment-house; action begin-
ning in 1935 and moving
through and beyond the war
years.
The family itself is so entirely
credible that you tend to
forget the parts are taken by
actors. V. Telegina’s picture
of the mother, placid up to
the outbreak of war, when
most of her family enlists, then
heartbroken when she realises
that her second son is really
going to the front, is a master-
piece in feeling and suffering.
N. Yelizarov, as the father,
has a less-sustained part; and
probably his most touching
scene is where, trying to say
good-bye to his wife as he
leaves for the war, he tells
her to water the flowers regu-
larly and all sorts of other
inconsequential things, shutting
out the thought, burning
between them, that he may
not return —while, anyway,
his home is virtually shattered.
In many ways the film is
strikingly similar to the Gorki
trilogy—a sort of swift tele-
scoping of Part 1. Such situa-
tions as the dinner-party, with
some of the family showing
the characteristic signs of
drunkenness; the remorse of
the geologist’s wife seduced by
the eldest son; the sequence
where Sergei, the second son,
grows swiftly to young man-
hood ; the portrait of his girl-
friend, the young lady obsessed
with an acting career, later
killed while nursing ; and the
clever photography of Sergei
stunned by the news of her
death, the camera peering down
into a tiled hallway with the
boy motionless near the door
—all these, caught in a rich
fabric of storytelling, combine
to give a first-class piece of
film-making.

‘‘Razzia”
This French film, by the
author of “Rififi,” has the same
qualities as that classic ; intense
realism, strong suspense, tech-
nical conviction as to subject,
and acting that could scarcely
be bettered.
Whereas “Rififi” traced a
brilliantly planned jewel-
robbery and the internecine
gang-war that followed it, this
film is an expose of the drug-
traffic in Paris, and of the
methods, subtle and brutal,
used by both traffickers and
police.
As well as telling a human
story simply and clearly, the
director projects a sharp over-
all picture of the organisation

MUSIC OF 1959
TN one way at least the year
just ended made musical
history for Australia —for the
first time a full-sized orchestra
from overseas visited us. And
what a size was the Czech
Philharmonic! Its 110 players
—22 more than our biggest
resident orchestra —made music
magnificently under its per-
manent conductor Karel
Ancerl. Packed houses greeted
it everywhere, and at the
fanciest prices, too. It was a
triumph of publicity as well as
of musicianship.
As- an advance-guard five of
its principal desks in the wind-
section came as an ensemble
and gave some rarely-heard
Bohemian pieces among the
standard classics.
The late-summer festival,
now firmly established as a
traditional opener for the sea-
son in Sydney, was under the
baton of Sir Bernard Heinze,
and, with the competent Hun-
garian pianist Andor Foldes
as soloist, ranged over a fair
cross-section of the concerto
anthology, from Bach and
Beethoven to Liszt, with a
sprinkling of the moderns, in-
cluding a fine work by Britain’s
Alan Rawsthorne, one Proko-
fieff and two Bartoks—quite
the best Bartok heard here for
a long time.
Despite torrid conditions,
the orchestra did first-rate
work, but in the early part of
the season proper they suffered
a falling-off under American
Alfred Wallenstein and
Rumanian Constantin Silvestri
(whose unhappy visit ended in
his walking-out in a huff —but
not before he had fashioned a
notable Brahms First).
The orchestra recovered its
touch with some solid work
under Malko —among whose
first-performances in Sydney
was a fierce blast of nothing
by one Barraud, an alleged
leader of music in France—
and, by the time Joseph Krips
arrived, it was in top form.
The ebullient Viennese, heav-
ing his enormous bulk around
the .podium, achieved score-
less readings of great worth,
as he had done here before.
Outstanding among visiting
pianists was the Russian
woman Tatyana Nikolayeva,
who, bursting unheralded
upon us, brought an exemplary
technique, temperament and
musicianship to bear on a
notable performance of
Brahms’s Handel Variations.
Young Viennese pianist Ingrid
Haebler was more at home in
lighter works; and her art,
too, had quite a polish to it.
Czech-American Rudolf Fir-
kusny exhibited a formidable
range of tonal colors, but was
sometimes too light on the
interpretative side.
Beryl Kimber, the young
Tasmanian violinist, returning
home a celebrity in her own
right, wielded a facile bow to
show how much she’d forged
ahead under the tutoring of
the great Oistrakh. French-
man Devy Erlih, though not
quite as good as his com-
patriot Christian Ferras (here
three years ago), revealed
enough potential to make him
a possible first-flighter within
a decade.
Among the singers, Matti-
wildi Dobbs came again from
the U.S. to charm us almost
as much by her sparkling
presence as by the beauty and
purity of her coloratura and
her high art in its use.
There were two baritones as
good as they come. Frenchman
Gerard Souzay, who never went
after the spectacular but played
on his vocal chords with the
ease of a Kreisler on his Strad.,
showed a peak of artistry in a
beautiful performance of the
greatest and most difficult of all
song-cycles, Schubert’s “Winter
Journey.” Russian Igor Gorin
sang as effortlessly as others
breathe, with copybook produc-
tion, and went right to the heart
of every composer he
approached.
Tenor Jan Peerce, sole rep.
of the Tait organisation, roared
into the vocal stratosphere to
best advantage from operatic
launching-sites.
Other visitors were Sigurd
Rascher, who demonstrated in
a matey way that the saxo-

reau, from France, who made
magic on the big organs of

Musica Viva held the
chamber - music emplacement
sturdily, giving encouragement
to local talent by using princi-
pal orchestra - members in
various ensembles, as well as
bringing out once more the
Alma Trio—as smooth a piano-

roams the world circuit —and

Australia suffered a grievous
loss in the untimely death at

Sydney girl whose coloratura-
soprano was one of the purest

years..
Among rising singers who
made a strong impact was
Elaine Blight, who showed, in
winning the final of the City
of Sydney Eisteddfod, that she
has musical brains as well as a
lyric - soprano of unusual
quality.
One of the heartening
features of the musical year
was the steady artistic advance-
ment among suburban musical
groups. Of these, the live-wire
Rockdale (Sydney) Symphony
Orchestra, predominantly
amateur but with a lacing of
professionals, has been most
adventurous in its choice of
material. Another Sydney
suburb, Burwood, has a musical
society which is going ahead,
particularly in G. and S. pro-
ductions.
The flop of the year was the
production by the N.S.W. Con-
servatorium Opera School
of “Faust”—an exaggeratedly
modernistic production, with
ill-designed costumes, reduced
the work to a travesty.

REVIEW BY MR. H. HASTINGS DEERING
Chairman and Managing Director of the
to the Annual General Meetings off Shareholders off Hastings
Diesels Limited, Hastings Peering Building Limited and
Hastings Peering Service Limited, held in Sydney on 30th
December, 1959.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
While this is necessarily a review of the year 1958-59,
the brief time that has passed since our year’s end in August
may permit me to make some observations on our present and
prospective operations.
Our Companies reflect the general prosperity of Australia
and particularly the economy of the States in which our major
franchises are held. Seasonally the year under review was not
a good one for Queensland, where we have, among others,
the valuable Caterpillar franchise. Drought persisted in wide
areas of the State. It was a year in the earlier part of which
the price of wool had not yet taken its upward turn.
But this check to earnings from regional industry—
happily balanced, as we have seen, through the growing
strength of the Australian economy as a whole—is far
from normal in a State which has so much of all the settled
and occupied land in Australia and the greatest proportion
of good farm land in the Commonwealth.
The Queensland picture has changed visibly in recent
months. Since the end of our financial year in August, events
have moved swiftly in a programme of major works for the
State’s development.
The Commonwealth Government has agreed to provide a
loan of £2O million to enable the Queensland Government,
with £lO million from its own resources, to undertake the
complete rehabilitation of the railway line linking the great
Mount Isa mine with its port and coal resources on the coast.
This has been followed by Queensland’s engagement of
the consultant engineering firm of Ford, Bacon and Davis,
Inc., of New York, to plan and direct the reconstruction.
The effect of this work will go beyond the doubling of
Mount Isa’s already rich production. It will give impetus to
Queensland’s and Australia’s general expansion. With an
early target date set for the work’s completion, rehabilitation
of the line will be well under way in 1960.
Meanwhile, in accent to the remarkable mineral develop-
ment that is taking place in the north, the Commonwealth
Aluminium Corporation Pty. Ltd. is going ahead with exten-
sive groundwork at the big bauxite site at Weipa, in Cape York
Peninsula. Its agreement with the Queensland Government
requires it to spend a minimum of £45 million, rising to a
possible £175 million if the conversion of bauxite to aluminium
can be carried out economically in the area. Proposals for
powering this total project include the possible use of the huge
open-cut coal measures at Blair Athol, near Rockhampton.
These are aspects of the enormous mineral future that is
opening for Queensland. Copper, silver-lead, uranium and
bauxite have been underlined in big-scale enterprise. Other
fields are in prospect and the State is preparing for its larger
contribution to a future in which, on the authority of the
Department of National Development, the minerals of
Northern Australia may yet be earning this country more than
it receives annually from its wool.
Another major move in Queensland has been the
Government’s final approval, in November, of its £3,200,000
scheme for a network of all-weather roads to connect the
Channel Country with the State’s three railway trunk systems
into the interior. The roads will allow cattle from the
Northern Territory and the Channel Country to be taken to
Queensland railheads by road-trains for sending to meatworks
at Townsville, Rockhampton and Brisbane. This operation, it
will be readily seen, involves both the construction of roads
and the supply of road-trains. It is to be started this year
as an urgent undertaking, with or without Commonwealth
subsidy. I was privileged to introduce the first road-train into
Australia and, to-day, road-trains are supplied by our
subsidiary, A.E.C. (Australia) Pty. Ltd.
Yet another large-scale Queensland project in which we
have a considerable interest is the clearing of immense areas
of brigalow land. This reclamation of rich-soil country in a
broken belt six hundred miles long and two hundred miles
wide is part of the Queensland Government’s new land
settlement policy. And the real work on it is only beginning.
The total area involved exceeds twenty million acres. The
brigalow lands are in the twenty to thirty inch rainfall belt.
Their availability to production should be one of the most
important contributions to Australian land settlement in this
century. The classic method of clearing the brigalow is by
crawler tractors dragging a heavy chain. Our Company has
already supplied approximately £1,100,000 worth of Cater-
pillar diesel tractors and equipment to this work.
1 have recounted these very recent developments in
Queensland because they are typical of the national under-
takings which our Companies have the necessary equipment
to supply—at a time when efficient mechanisation is as
important to Australia’s economic advancement as the actual
turning of our national resources to productive account. The
Northern Territory of Australia and the Territories of
Papua/New Guinea are also to be included as areas in which
we are working and in which much development lies ahead.
Our capital resources, strengthened in good time two
years ago, place our Companies in a very favourable condition
of financial strength for the opportunities ahead. The fact that
our freehold land and buildings—appearing in the consolidated
balance sheets of the Companies at £1,328,268 —are to-day
valued at approximately £2,300,000 affords additional security
for shareholders’ funds.
It can be said, therefore, that the outlook now is very
much better than it was a year ago.
For Australia as a whole, the good cycle continues.
Production is expanding, the value of exports has risen to a
point at which import restrictions have been substantially
relaxed and the level of individual prosperity is indicated by
the fact that more than one thousand new motor vehicles were
registered, on an average, each working day in Australia last
October. It was an all-time record.
Along with this, investment capital flowing readily into
this country is accompanied by a wide freedom of enterprise.
We can look forward to the decade we are entering in
1960 as one in which Australia will develop even more
quickly and dramatically. And in that our Companies will
certainly share, because they supply the very type of equipment
and services by which the nation will gather to itself
increasingly more in productive power for the years ahead.

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
Bank of Adelaide
The smallest of the major trading-banks
in Australia, the Bank of Adelaide
concentrates its activities mainly in S.A.
where it has a growing business both
with primary and secondary industries.
In common with other trading-banks,
the Adelaide has sought to improve its
earnings by investments in finance-
houses outside traditional banking
business, which is subject to considerable
Government restriction and intervention.
A 40 p.c. interest is held in Finance
Corporation of Australia. Late in the
1957-58 term the bank joined the list of
shareholders in Development Finance
Corporation, Ltd., and completed
arrangements to act as an agent for
Australian Fixed Trusts, itself a member
of the D.F.C. group.
The passing of the Federal banking
legislation came too late to leave a trace
in last year’s figures. In any case the
new Central Bank set-up is unlikely to
alter the existing pattern and scope of
the trading-banks’ business and earnings,
although some hopes are held that the
rate of interest allowed on the new
reserve-deposit accounts (which are to
replace the old special accounts) will be
“commensurate with ruling market
rates.”
Seasonal conditions experienced during
the last season were described as bounti-
ful, and enabled the bank to increase
both deposits and advances.
Disclosed earnings for the year ended
Sept. 30, 1959, remained modest, slipping
down by another £3338 to £208,468,
equal to an earning-rate of 11.9 p.c. on
the unchanged average share-capital.
This compared with 12.1 p.c. in 1958,
and an average of 11.7 p.c. in the pre-
ceding five years:

Dividend remained steady at 10 p.c.,
absorbing £175,000 and leaving only
£33,468 of the disclosed net profit for
visible reserves, now built-up to
£1,975,217.
The bank's 40 p.c. interest in Finance
Corporation of Australia continued to
be a valuable investment, but the
revenue from it was “confined to divi-
dends received, and these are not of
sufficient magnitude at present to warrant
any increased benefits to stockholders.”
The “flurry of takeover bids” in recent
months had caused some speculation in
the bank’s stock. The chairman’s address
once again stressed that “there was no
foundation” in the persistent rumors
about the bank’s ownership passing into
other hands outside South Australia. This
followed two similar statements to the
press earlier during last term.
The wool-clip last season was the
second-largest recorded, but average
prices were down 22 p.c. The current
wool-season has opened well and con-
fidently, but was too late to exert an
appreciable influence on the Adelaide’s
1958-59 figures.
A bumper grain-and-hay harvest last
season has been followed in S.A. by
drought and uncertainty this season.
Heavier demands were made on the
bank’s resources during the year under
review. Advances, at £19,264,404, rose
£1,753,887 —from 48 p.c. to 50.3 p.c. of
deposits. The bank’s ample liquid assets
were £432,348 higher at £22,258,341, or
58.2 p.c. of deposits (59.9 p.c. in 1958):

The bank held no Treasury-bills at
balance-date, but its holding of Govern-
ment bonds was £1,609,510 higher at
£5,982,675. Statutory deposit with the
Commonwealth Bank stood at £5,068,000
following the release of £400,000 from
this account. Total assets were £2,509,576
higher at £43,895,267.
The outlook for the current agricul-
tural season in South Australia is bad.
General rains now would not benefit
cereal crops, and the harvest is certain
to be one of the lowest on record in
the State. Prospects are variable, but
some crops are expected to be a total
failure.
According to the latest official esti-
mates by the S.A. Department of Agri-
culture, the current season’s grain-
harvest will be only about a quarter of
last year’s record yield, and a third of
the average yield for the last ten years.
The Australian Barley Board has advised
that it seems probable that the whole
barley crop harvested in S.A. and Vic-
toria will be consumed locally, with
none left for export.
On the other hand, steady growth
continued to be the keynote of the
State’s secondary industry both last year
and in the current term.
The Bank of Adelaide is marshalling
its resources to meet the inevitable
requests for assistance caused by poor
seasonal conditions in the current term
without withholding finance necessary
for industrial development.

A. G. Healing, Ltd.
The A. G. Healing group put up a
record turnover last term, but profits
failed to follow suit. Turnover rose by
£117,000 to £10,510,000. Profits dropped
£61,754 to £215,390. The chairman in
his annual report comments: “I never-
theless feel that in the face of all circum-
stances it was a successful year under
very difficult conditions,” and then went
on to add, “Generally speaking, as com-
petition in all departments of the business
becomes increasingly keener, we find that
the associated expenses substantially
due to industry practices over the years
and providing what might well be termed
‘extravagant service’—are constantly in-
creasing our operating-costs.”
Founded in Melbourne in 1896, the
business grew up around the manufac-
ture of bicycles, spreading out to include
the distribution of radio-components and
automotive parts and accessories a couple
of years before the public was offered a
share in 1927. Since then the co. has
only once failed to show a profit (in
1931) and ord. shareholders, who lost
a quarter of their capital at. the time,
can count 1931 and 1932 as their only
dry years.
Today the group manufactures radios,
TV-receivers, vacuum-cleaners, refrigera-
tors, washing-machines, metal-finishing

chemicals, equipment and automatic
plant. Activities extend also to whole-
sale distribution of automotive spare-
parts and metal-finishing materials. Last
term the group sold its bicycle interests,
which for some time had been growing
less profitable. Proceeds from the sale,
which was for cash, were channelled to
the finance subsidiary, R. and G.
Finances Pty.
Principal Healing factories are centred
around Melbourne, an Australia-wide
market being served through warehouses
in all mainland capitals and Launceston,
Canberra, Newcastle and Albury.
Branches are also established in a num-
ber of Melbourne suburbs and Victorian
country centres.
All phases of the group’s activities
faced rising costs last year. The very
nature of the automotive spare-parts sec-
tion —its infinite variety of individual
component-parts and consequent mass of
detailed work —made it particularly
susceptible to the cost menace. Valuable
distribution franchises, direct from
several important car - manufacturers,
however, plus steps undertaken by
management to streamline the depart-
ment, augur well for the future.
Radical changes took place in the
metal-finishing division. Connections
with the Canning organisation of Bir-
mingham, England, were severed, and
alternative arrangements concluded with
the Deinhart organisation of Stuttgart,
West Germany. Under the new set-up,
manufacture of mechanical plating-plants
will be undertaken locally. Always a
strong section, this division now promises
wider development and better returns.
The appliance function continues to
grow. A new Thor washing-machine is
expected to have “a very great market
impact.” A recently introduced re-
frigerating system and a complete re-
frigerator are selling well. A domestic
air-conditioning unit is on the way. The
radio section has suffered somewhat from
competition with lower-priced transistor-
sets of Japanese origin.
The group has obtained a shock-
absorber-manufacturing contract for new
Ford models, and has a manufacturing
arrangement for specialised service-tools
for other new-model cars. This licence
was obtained by agreement with V. L.
Churchill and Co., Ltd. (England), and
Manzel, U.S.A. (a unit of Houdaille
Industries Inc.).
Despite the drop in group profit, divs.
were kept at 15 p.c., this rate having
been maintained since 1950. Profits were
struck after setting aside £122,464 (up
£10,462) for depreciation and £155,751
(down £33,824) for taxation. Earn-
ings covered the pref. divs. and

The most outstanding feature, however,
was the massive increment to theoretical
working-capital; Last year, working-
capital stood at £2,113,614 ; at June 30
last it had reached £3,404,558, an increase
of £1,290,944. Current assets increased
by £788,145 and current liabilities
decreased by £502,799. Contributing
factors included: Stock up £312,024
(£3,209,930 at balance-date) and debtors
up £476,005 (£2,938,650); current loans
down £362,046 (£232,854), overdraft
down £141,783 (£1,008,206), creditors
down £33,380 (£909,468), sundry pro-
visions down £21,526 (£32,997), tax pro-
vision down £21,529 (£194,316) and h.-p.
provision up £49,590 (£197,315).
At this juncture it seems certain the
current term will bring no easing of
already intense competition. Maintenance
of the 15 p.c. div., however, remains
well within Healing's capabilities. In the
first quarter of the present financial
year profit-yields were in line with budget
estimates, and while it is true these results
have to a large degree followed the
extension of TV into other States and
into country areas, it is equally true that
the widening television market will boost
performances for some time to come.
Management meanwhile is actively seek-
ing further diversification of the group's
funds, and wherever such funds are
deemed idle they are being switched to
more profitable channels.
Healing's ss. ords. recently fetched
14s. 2d. on 'Change, to yield 5.3 p.c.
from a 15 p.c. div. The ords. have a
net tangible backing of 12s 3d., and the
prefs., both 6 p.c. and 8 p.c., £5 12s. 4d.
Except for a minor write-up in 1948,
assets have never been revalued.

Rocla Pipes, Ltd*.
/"Vne of the major producers of concrete
products in Australia, Rocla manu-
factures concrete pipes and conduits,
including prestressed concrete pipes. It
also puts-out troughing, well-liners, chan-
nelling culverts and paving-flags. Its
other products include chemicals for the
waterproofing and hardening of cement
and concrete.
The co. operates 13 factories in N.S.W.,
Victoria, Queensland and S.A. A 50 p.c.
interest is held in a South African
associate, Rocla Pipes (Africa), with
plants in the Union and Rhodesia. Rocla
receives substantial royalties from
licensing arrangements with overseas cos.
Overseas business continued to boom
in 1958-59, bringing further “substantial
amounts” into Rocla’s coffers. In Pakis-
tan work proceeded steadily on the huge
Karachi water-supply project where pre-
stressed Rocla pipes are being used.
Further royalty-payments were re-
ceived from Germany, France, Italy,
S. Africa and Rhodesia. Rocla reports
that its French associates have secured
contracts for building and installation of
three of its machines behind the Iron
Curtain. The co. will receive lump-sum
royalties for each of these.
In 1958 Rocla Pipes (New Guinea),

contract. Last year the co.
carried out the work of applying
a protective coating of cement-
mortar to 35,000 ft. of steel
pipes which are to be installed
in the new water-system under
construction by the Common-
wealth Works Department. The
New Guinea subsidiary dis-
closed £11,160 net trading-
profit for the year ended June
30, 1959.
In Victoria, a full quota of
orders was carried out for the
Country Roads Board, the
Melbourne and Metropolitan
Board of Works, the State
Rivers and Water Supply Com-
mission and other authorities
and industries. An interesting
contract involved concrete-
lining nearly 1000 steel
cylinders (15ft. long and sft.
diam.), used for the heavy
reinforced-concrete pier foun-
dations for Melbourne’s new
£4-million King Street bridge.
A large quantity of Rocla
sewer-pipes was installed by the
Board of Works in Mel-
bourne’s new living and indus-
trial areas. Other orders
include those for the new Ford
factory and Clyde Industries
factories, both at Broad-
meadows (Vic.), and the
£6-million project for Chad-
stone Shopping Centre Pty.,
Ltd.
The main N.S.W. contract
was for the £1,100,000 31-mile
Fish River water-pipeline
(now completed), for which
Rocla’s Lithgow (N.S.W.) fac-
tory manufactured over 10,000
prestressed concrete pipes.
The co. also carried out the
installation, much of it through
rocky and heavily-timbered
country. This project was
described as the longest pre-
stressed pipeline in Australia.
The co. also secured a con-
tract with the Sydney Metro-
politan Water, Sewerage and
Drainage Board for 9000 ft. of
36-inch diameter pressure-
pipes for an outlet-main from
Liverpool Dam.
Business in S.A. and Queens-
land “maintained a satisfactory
level,” and prospects in both
States are said to be favorable.
Net trading-profit, before
tax, for the year ended June
30, 1959, was £45,790 higher
at £351,570, including £11,160
divs. from the New Guinea
subsidiary. This was after
charging all expenses, includ-
ing a steady £60,000 for depre-
ciation, £B5O directors’ fees
and £B5O auditors’ fees. Pro-
vision for taxation absorbed
£137,000 (up £3000), leaving
net profit £42,790 higher at
£214,570:

Tax-provision looked a shade
high at the current rates and
the increase in tax was dis-
proportionate to the rise in
earnings. However, one can’t
jump to any conclusions
because of the complications
presented by different taxation
systems and rates in the many
overseas countries in which
the co. operates or has interests.
The earning-rate on the
average ord. capital jumped to
37.6 p.c., compared with 30 p.c.
on smaller ord. capital in the
previous term, and an average
of 27.1 p.c. in the preceding
four years. The 1958 increase
in the div.-rate, and the accom-
panying small (l-for-20) bonus
handout, were absorbed with-
out difficulty.
Last year Rocla declared a
25 p.c. dividend, all in cash.
This included a 10 p.c.
“special bonus” from extra
overseas earnings, in addition
to the steady 15 p.c. basic
rate. The cheque absorbed
£142,770, leaving £71,800 for
reserves, which had also bene-
fited by £3169 undisclosed net
additions.

£28,767 during the year
(£27,267 representing the 1958

such as the Jibaros and Moti-
lones. These tribes have been
found, before the advent of
white men in numbers, to be

first white man has entered

—a fact quickly broadcast by
the grapevine telegraph.
With these slight amend-
ments, the chapters dealing
with the geologist's role in oil-
finding are as good as any-
thing available to the lay
reader. That is true, also, of
almost every chapter in the
book, although it is evident
—through the absence of
emphasis on the “mud, blood
and boredom” which (prior to
World War II) characterised
both military campaigns and
pioneer oil-exploration that
Ward spent much of his life as
a war correspondent.
The meticulous care with
which Shell employees are
selected and groomed is well
described, and the reader will
envy the successful candidate,
although at The Hague (as at
all h.-q. of large establishments)
an annoying disregard of local
requirements is sometimes
evident. That “Charlie Pieters”
got away with what would be
classed as rank insubordination
is very doubtful. I’ll leave the
reader to find out why.
In some ways, the title of the
book is unfair to Shell; its
search for oil has never been
haphazard, but has always been
controlled by very careful and
thorough exploration, and every
possible risk —even the market-
ing conditions has been
taken into account.
All persons interested in any
way in the petroleum industry

inner workings of any large
and successful organisation—

L. O.
by intangibles, was partly
responsible for the high
earning-rate on the share-
capital, and gave a net asset-
backing of 375. 7d. for every
20s. of the scrip.
Changes in the presentation
of some items in the balance-
sheet make closer comparisons
difficult, but the overall posi-
tion did not change much from
the previous term. Land and
buildings were shown at
£206,109 (up £16,260). Depre-
ciated book-value of plant, etc.,
increased by £22,642 to
£330,995, making total visible
capital expenditure on fixed
assets £98,902.
During the year the co. sub-
scribed for a further 10,000
shares of £1 (S. African) each,
in the associate Rocla Pipes
(Africa) Pty., Ltd. These
cost £12,586 in Australian
currency and brought Rocla’s
total investment in the co. to
£A92,184.
Although shareholders should
not expect record results in
Australia and overseas year
after year, Rocla’s sound
financial position, and the high
repute in which its products
are held, point the way to a
busy and prosperous future.
There is scope for capital-
expansion.
An important point is that
in spite of increases in manj
wage-awards, and rises in the
costs of some of the raw
materials, the co. is said to
have been able to maintain
stable prices, and even claim
some reductions in its quotes.
The absence of the all-too-
frequent screams about rising
costs and brisk (“unfair”) com-
petition, coupled with pleas
for Government protection,
makes the co.’s financial reports
pleasant reading. This is a
tribute to the efficiency of
Rocla, and of the people who
run it and work-for it.
Shareholders have done well
with three bonus- and two
cash-issues since 1954-55.
Sellers ask 345. for a ss. f.-p.
unit, making the yield almost
3.7 p.c. on the basis of the
25 p.c. div.-rate.
Woolcord Fabrics, Ltd.
Opecialising exclusively in the
weaving of uncut moquette
for domestic and commercial
consumers, Woolcord Fabrics,
Ltd., operates from Seymour,
Victoria. Wool is \ the basic
raw material.
With a paid-up capital of
£110,302 (including £12,562
convertible prefs.), and total
shareholders’ funds at £137,347,
the co. is a relatively small
show. However, its scrip is
widely listed, and the ord. divs.
have been a steady, if modest,
8 p.c. over the past four years.
Since March, 1959, Wool-
cord’s shares have gone up by
ss. 6d. to 20s. a £1 unit, with the
current yield edging down from
the high H p.c. to 8 p.c.
This was in spite of the fact
that earnings for the last term
were a shade lower than in the
previous year. Trading con-
ditions throughout the fur-
nishing industry during the
last twelve months were
described as much quieter
than in the preceding period.
The effect of this was reflected
in “some falling-off of demand”
for upholstery coverings.
Woolcord embarked on a
wide advertising - campaign
(including extensive use of
commercial TV), mainly in Vic-
toria, to stimulate demand. The
results are understood to be
satisfactory. The decline in
sales was arrested and the year’s
turnover was only “slightly
less” than that averaged in the
preceding three years.
However, advertising lifted
costs and reduced the final net-
profit figure. But it is expected
that benefits stemming from
this intensive publicity campaign
will not be restricted to the
last term alone, and will have
a favourable effect on trading
in the future.
There was very little
increase in overseas competi-
tion. The imports of moquettes
from U.K. have fallen over the
last few years. However,
imports from Continental Eur-
ope (particularly from Belgium)
over the same period have
increased. This has come
about since the last changes in
tariffs (May, 1955). The co.
claims that “from the statis-
tics available it would appear
that Belgian prices were
reduced to offset the increased
duty payable on cheaper and
inferior moquettes.”
Net profit for the year ended
June 30, 1959, was £3027
lower at £11,207. This was
after charging £4432 deprecia-
tion (down £529) and setting
aside £6850 for taxation
(down £1450):

In the first quarter of the

and production was stepped-

the first half-year is forecast.
The easing of import-restric-
tions could bring along stronger
competition from European
producers. However, Japan
does not appear a dangerous
rival. Another thing to be
watched carefully is the trend
in current fashions.

London Airmail
From Herbert Holman
Tf 1959 was a very active and
vigorous year in the theatre
it was hardly a progressive one.
Most of the current successes
are from previous years, and
include “The Mousetrap”
(eighth year), “Roar Like a
Dove” (third year), “The Grass
is Greener,” “My Fair Lady.”
“Irma la Douce” and “West
Side Story.”
The year has had its fiascos,
of which John Osborne’s “The
World of Paul Slickey” was the
chilliest. It was bad. Not so
another musical, “Marigold,”
adapted from the well-known
play by Alan Melville, with
music by Charles Zwar. This
was a really expert job, in-
volving over two years of
casting and preparation; but
the public didn’t take to its
tweeness. The adapter, a
particularly skilled and experi-
enced man-of-the-theatre, was
doubly unfortunate in that a
straight play of his, the very-
opposite of unsophisticated,
failed at the same time.
John Clements and Kay
Hammond, who not long ago
had a considerable following,
were unable to keep Lionel
Hale’s delicate but rather thin
fantasy, “Gilt and Ginger-
bread,” afloat and have now
settled for an American comedy
on a sexual theme which is
considered by many to be un-
worthy of them.
‘The Darling Buds of May,”
a best-selling book and a suc-
cessful film, was taken off
quickly, as was “The Shifting
Heart.” Other ventures to
finish prematurely included a
previously unperformed Lons-
dale play and vehicles for the
veterans Cicely Courtneidge
and Sybil Thorndike.
Change of sex is the common
theme of two failures—
“Slickey,” where it was inci-
dental, and “Aunt Edwina,”
where it decidedly was not. The
critics slammed them both, but
the latter earns mention for
the persistence of the author,
William Douglas Home, who
not only took up argument
with one critic in his own
paper, challenging him phrase
by phrase, but who also
appeared on stage at the end of
each performance and asked
those of the audience who dis-
agreed with the reviews to clap
their hands. He is now known
as “Tinker Bell.”
The Year’s Best
The most promising find of
the year was Willis Hall, whose
“The Long and the Short and
the Tall” has brought him
world-wide fame (but the play,
opened and closed
during the year). He is a
writer blessedly free of gim-
micks who has both the talent
and the technical equipment to
be a stayer.
A play of similar type is
Beverley Cross’s “One More
River,” with an all-male cast
which includes Paul Rogers at
his finest and Robert Shaw,
who graduated from the other
play and who has also won
applause from the critics for
his first novel.
“Roots,” by another young
author, Arnold Wesker, un-
fortunately fell victim to the
dreaded “break” (the arrange-
ment whereby a play must be
taken-off if the receipts fall
below a specified figure). This
minor tragedy of rural atti-
tudes was astringent, individual
and of high literary merit.
Except, perhaps, for the
late starter, “Rosmersholm,”
the year saw neither great
drama nor great individual act-
ing. One enterprising company,
it is true, tried to storm the
Town from a Hammersmith
base with a season of classics,
but the standard of acting and
presentation wasn’t uniformly
high. In the West End, most
people would plump for
Michael Redgrave’s adaptation
of Henry James’s “The Aspern
Papers.” Redgrave and
Flora Robson are excellent,
although the latter doesn't quite
fulfil the demands of the last
act ; the play is interesting for
its quaintness, but is not
especially theatre-worthy.
The Old Vic is in splendid
fettle, having given us Moliere,
Pinero, Shelley, Congreve and
Wilde as well as Shakspeare.
If the results haven’t always
been of the versatility that, say,
the “Comedie Fran?aise” can
command, this is not immedi-
ately apparent, for the Vic pro-
ducers are extremely clever at
tailoring their plays to fit the
actors. Notable performances
are remembered from Barbara
Jefford (Rosalind and Lady
Gwendolen), Alec McCowen
(Touchstone), Rosalind Atkin-
son (Miss Prism) and Robert
Harris (John O’ Gaunt).
Australians have enjoyed
some prominence. Peter Finch,
returning to the stage after six
years in films, appeared for
a while in a duologue at the
Haymarket. Coral Browne,
after having been summoned
to co-star in Hollywood with
Rosalind Russell, has spent
most of the year at this theatre
as the wife in “The Pleasure
of His Company,” a frothy
American comedy of manners.
Polished but utterly artificial,
this trifle is in constant debt
to her classical poise and
technical finesse.
Leo McKern plays the
title-role in the French comedy
“Rollo,” with authority and a
ripe but disciplined sense of
comedy.
Margaret Johnstone has
played at the Royal Court and
elsewhere. Two names new to
the West End are Lyndall Bar-
bour and Maggie Fitz Gibbon,
and more is heard of one of
the juiciest character-actors in
the • profession, Gordon
Gostelow.
And at the Coliseum, Robert
Helpmann and Loudon Saint-
hill are responsible for the pro-
duction and decor of a
fantastically extravagant
“Aladdin.”
Milestone
The theatre was always in-
calculable, but never more so
than with the history-making
Mermaid, which has turned
out to be the most successful
venture in the annals of the
London stage. “Lock Up Your
Daughters” has made a profit
of more than £25,000 in six
months, enabling Bernard Miles
to pay off the building-debt
and to install air-condition-
ing and other improvements.
During the twice-nightly run
of this amusing but not par-
ticularly outstanding charade
(based on Henry Fielding’s
“Rape Upon Rape”) the Mer-
maid played to 98 per cent,
capacity, and its 500 seats
grossed £3OOO a week.
Miles is looking for a West
End theatre to accommodate his
successes (so, for that matter,
is Stratford-on-Avon) and is
prepared to pay £20,000 for a
two-year lease. He has been
criticised for departing from
his declared intention of reper-
tory at monthly intervals, but
he could hardly have been
expected to do otherwise. The
irony of the situation is that
plans were drawn-up so very
carefully to prevent the Mer-
maid from being a white
elephant. Situated at Puddle
Dock, it is not easy to find and,
because of narrow, congested
streets, inconvenient for cars
and taxis.
The title of the first pro-
duction was reached in the
same impromptu way as the
decision to bring the “Mer-
maid” to the Royal Exchange
in 1951 (when Australian Sir
Leslie Boyce suggested it to
Mr. and Mrs. Miles). The
composer, Anthony Collins,
was entertained to lunch.
“Have a drink?”
“No, thanks! I’m teetotal.”
“A cigarette?”
“Sorry, don’t smoke! But
lock up your daughters!”


COUNTRY TOWN
A WANDERER RETURNS 6 IN TWO PARTS: PART II
By HAL PORTER
The town is indeed more
changed, or rather is
changing more rapidly,
than I first thought. It
is also less changed, much less
changeable. One hand of the
clock races on, the other
slackens, drags, is reluctant.
The unpainted virgins of
my adolescence who handed
conversation-lollies —Meet me
at the corner, Do you like
kisses ?—in high-school geo-
graphy-lessons now play the
mother’s part in the Drama
Society’s “Quiet Weekend,”
rule the roost at Red Cross
meetings, support hefty back-
sides on shooting-sticks at
country race-meetings, are avid ~
Solo players, make shepherd's-
pie on Tuesday, sell for off-
shoot Christianity and too
much on market-day street-
stalls their no-egg Swiss-rolls,
their sugar-bag peg-aprons,
their jars of unsuccessful jams
from which the mould has
been skimmed: unbelievable
jams- Green Tomato and
Passionfruit, Carrot and
G ra P e -
The Angelus rings the same
pattern of threes on the same
bell I heard as a boy, but
Pioneer buses now pull-up
outside St. Pat’s while Pro-
testant women holding gesture-
handkerchiefs on unsure heads
and men walking stiff-legged as
Don Juan’s Commendatore go
to stare at the Heaven-and-
Hell-painted ceiling while aloft
the marble Virgin with daddy-
long-legs up her sleeves holds
dusty hands out towards the
neon - Eiffel - scaffolding of
Rash’s Tyre Service.
Seventy-year-old hawthorns
still hedge the river-flat pad-
docks, but the hop-kilns have
gone, and it is not an Australian
navvy or bank-clerk who
showily swallow-dives and
jack-knifes from the willows
by the Rowing Club but a
Berliner, brute-shouldered and
maiden-footed, looking younger
than he is, peacocking with-
out hope in the legal minimum
of baby-blue satin trunks,
spying among the lunch-time
shopgirls and Shire Hall typists
f° r a sort, a bint, a woman,
a wife, even a talkie-teener
sweetheart,
Changed, you see, yet un-
changed: the Technical-school
and High-school adolescents
wear grey melange, school-
striped ties, crested caps ; only
a scattering of these acned
androgynes, bejeaned and rug-
headed, become weekend Coca-
Cola boys when the lawn has
been mowed and the morning-
wood cut.
The gasometer is rustier;
the water-tower is grubbier ;
the back-streets are blanker
now that the elms are torn
ou t• b ut gasometer and water-
tower yet, streets yet. And
in those back-streets, their
Coolgardies replaced by
refrigerators, their outdoor
coppers by washing-machines,
their supper-cloths embroid-
ered with crinolined women by
aboriginal-motif those
I knew years ago still live
among moquette suites, “Italian
statuary,” Maxfield Parrish re-
productions, congoleum-
squares, and sideboards as
elaborate as reredoses. They
are those whose undeveloped
beauties of being, whose
immature cruelties, nobilities
and magnanimities are scarcely
used, rarely seen,
All the powers of language
and pleasures of communica-
tion are nil and nix-nought-
nothing. Theirs the servile
but deadly gestures of animals,
the slogans of popular science,
the monosyllables of news-
items ; when it is 103 degrees
in the shade, “Hot, eh?” they
say; Much besides charm
is truant. Resignation veils
all, or self-abnegation reeking
of conceit, or the egotism,
savagery and delusions of
motherhood.
IVf Y once * fri enc * s ’ those
Oxford-bags-and-Fair-Isle-
sweater youths are R.S.L. men
bewitched to Brickhill fans,
Masons with ulcers, Rotarians
with moustached wives and
clean-shaven sons, budgerigar-
or delphinium-cranks, com-
mittee-men, vestry-men, aitch-
less speechmakers, Rechabites,
beer-goitre boys, Scoutmasters,
saints in an airlock, mute
inglorious Casanovas, filleted
Satans, half-cold or flyblown
morsels on the plate of Time.
I, haunted by such important
unimportances as when to
write spirt and when spurt,
am irrevocably one of this
mob. My once-friends? Per-
haps friends yet, whom death
will change to nothing but the
dead, who see the lost sections
of their and my boyhood town
shining with false but blind-
ing charm through the over-
layings of more than 30 years.
There, we think, was the
pine avenue, that garage was
the joss-house for the settle-
ment of Amoy Chinese from
the goldfields, there were the
pioneer vineyards, the wharves
for the river-steamers, the old
convent, the row of giant
mulberry-trees. Cook’s Corner,
we say, Balmer’s Hill, the
Tannies, the Cut, Russo’s,
the School of Mines —names
that will go when we all go
Now is for them and me the
transparencies Now and Then
superimposed one on other.
We walk two streets when
we walk the one.
Not so the foreigners, the
New Australians walking in
the very heart now of our
barbarians’ luxury, rubbing
shoulders with those who
carry like a useless and unused
breviary the magic rubbish of
How to Win Friends and
Influence People ; not the
black-stockinged women all in
black and their podgy, sullen
daughters, their Latin male-
children who switch from
raucous boy to raucous
Tennessee Williams man be-
tween one Saturday morning's
Main Street gossiping and the
next ; not the Sicilians or
Albanians or Greeks under
1911 street-verandas and the
click of changing neons, short-
legged, rings on their dirty
fingers, womanlessly engaged
in melancholy or professional
carping, their eyes meantime
racing about like crickets to
covet in side-glances the
cinemaromanzi breasts of
paper-back platinum blondes ;
Not the Fire Brigade Dance
refusee, purple-suited, smelling
of Californian Poppy hair-oil,
stale sweat and Latvian lone-
liness ; not the gangling Dutch-
man chewing unwanted lips
before the display, like circus
machinery, of orange-colored
bale-loaders and rotary-hoes ;
not the sideburned pair, in tight
trousers of nameless cloth and
pointed shoes polka-dotted
with punctures, dawdling, as
through the mazes of home-
sickness, among the little girls’


games drawn like aboriginal
totems on the footpaths.
One street only these walk ;
they inhabit an lonesco stage-
set, a province without
memories, or memories only of
the day before yesterday: the
hysterical misunderstanding at
the employment-office, the
fight behind the Greek cafe,
the night-out with drunken
aborigines under the Wy Yung
Bridge, the voice crying, “You
bloody Dago bastard, you! ”
the male tears and threatening
knife in the shadow of the
tannery.
Until my flat was ready, and
flats are still as rare in
country towns as ants’ holidays,
I stayed on at the Something-
or-other Guest House occupy-
ing what the Hungarian pro-
prietors called a bungalow,
Kurt Schmidt die Hiitte and I
my cardboard box.
It was an immaculately kept
seven-foot cube of plaster-
board and Masonite under a
Topper loquat-tree I had often
climbed as a child. I fitted
into it, just, Laika in Sputnik ;
a visitor meant a physical
relationship.
Entering the back gate, near
the cave of shadow under the
peppercorn, to reach this toy
dwelling was, night after night,
like turning to yet another
illustration in a work by Goya
or Hogarth. It was here, out-
side the gate, that boarders
returning home went
through a kind of ritual
purification. It was partly the
result of the stern commercial
motherlinesses of the Hun-
garians, partly unwritten
etiquette, to complete pre-
sleep dirty work under the
peppercorn, to remove, as it
were, all make-up before
bedding-down ; once the gate
slammed behind, the night was
formally over.
Consequently someone was
always emptying himself of
too much Ruby Port or bottled
beer, or maudlinly mopping-
up the blood-nose he had given
his bubbling china, or hooking
arms for a surrealistic half-an-
hour over the fence-top to
autosuggest legs straight, strong
■and biddable for the walk
across the yard, up the steps and
down the dangerous corridor.
Presently, night after night,
it was obvious that the snowy-
haired one of two bodies
wrestling, mumbling and
mewling amorously in the
cavern of shadow was Kurt
Schmidt. The other was the
new kitchenmaid-waitress who
occupied a cell simmering with
cheap scent somewhere in the
hive of the boarding-house.
After Football Dance, Old-time
Ball or cinema this nightly
rehearsal for the activity of
consummation boiled down to
merely male and female, Kurt
Schmidt and Vi’let Smith, say-
ing goodnight at the front
gate, the same gate for both,
and a back gate.
Vi’let Smith, indeed, may
never have had a front gate.
For her, the kitchenmaid who
was a pantrymaid’s daughter,
Kurt Schmidt might well be
Cinderella’s handsome foreigner
from a Mills - and - Boon
romance ; for the German who
had been exposed to more
thousands of miles, more
sharpening and hardening
experiences, this too ordinary
relationship was possibly a
treachery of his own flesh. Or
was he astute enough to accept
that no grazier’s golfing-
daughter in a Humber would
fall for his cute fireman’s face,
film-star-smutted, at the rail-
way crossing? No doctor’s
widow (1958 Chryser Royal)
turn her hot eye himwards
some enchanted morning out-
side the barber’s? No crumb
of country-town woman fall
to a New Australian from any
table the subtlest class higher?
But time blows by gustily as
the breaths of passion.
How time blew by! Mop-
ping and mowing like a willy-
willy past the plastic bracken
in the butcher’s Sunday shop-
window, past the gravestone
of my mother who died 10
years younger than T am now,
past the Gothic Boer War
monument (imported marble),
the towering 1914-1918 Ceno-
taph (local granite) with its
footnote for the dead of
World War II (cracked-cement
troughs of gazanias), past all
sorts of lovers who thought
they loved, past Vi’let Smith
with her chewed fingernails
and engagement ring of three
pin-head diamonds.
Kurt Schmidt no longer
deepened dimples to excite me
to buy an M.G., a jinker or
even pawnshop roller-skates.
He asked my advice, stern and
dedicated, on the fundamentals
of setting-up house, on radio-
grams, wall-plaques three
ducks in Peter Scott flight,
musical beer-steins and plastic
salad-servers. He austerely
dropped tailormades for the
makings, drank portergaffs,
put threepences in a milk-
bottle, and finished mauling
Vi’let goodnight at the first
whistle of the midnight train.
ATost evocative, most haunt-
ing of night noises is that
cry of the late train —wearily
exultant journey’s-ending, a
telescope of sound through
which the eye in the ear sees
the acres of moonlit paddocks
surrounding the town, the
never-ending net of post-and-
rail, the Golgothic slaughter-
yards, the cemetery overrun
with sparaxis, the rams or
ghosts of rams, the mopoke-
haunted windbreaks, the wind-
mills, the messmate hills and
bellbird gullies, the smaller
towns beyond—tin and boards,
and silence broken only by a
baby crying like a ewe, the
suburbs half - country, the
suburbs half-city, and, dirty as
a potato, the faraway youth-
luring city itself.
Ah, the midnight train!
the train filled with fatigue,
with abandoned magazines,
crushed paper-cups, lolling
bodies, faces wearing eyes
looped in shadows. It is bring-
ing Auntie Ettie, the common-
as-dirt old-age pensioner; or
Aunt Margaret, the well-heeled
whinger with her beloved
papilloma; it is bringing the
end-of-term schoolgirl boarder;
grandpa with the shark’s-tooth
on his watch-chain; Bruce
from the Melbourne Show;
mother and the new city-born
baby; bringing Australians
home again.
Now it brings, too, the smell-
of-an-oilrag escapees from
tourist countries littered with
the fabulous wreckage of pasts,
the shrewd, the defeated, the
go-getting, the horizon-chasing,
the undercutting, from Athens,
Bethnal Green, Hamburg,
Haarlem, Mammola and
Vysoke Myto, the women in
black with fate-like faces and
dandruffy madonna coiffures,
the runtish men reeking of
garlic and grappa, the Cockney
with rotten teeth. Here come
the sly eyes, the' bare, doggy
eyes, the lips hemmed together,
the cheeks twitching still from
a life of unfulfilled ventures, the
spiv hands, the beast hands with
grimy knuckles, the foreign
garments buttoned on savings
folded as tightly in purses as
fear is in the kernel of being.
In this story of a country
town I must; reluctantly,
imagine one scene only. One
sentence, then, of invention:
Kurt Schmidt sits, decorously
disposed on the green leather
of a second-class smoker,
dimples in abeyance, suitcases
Teutonically buckled, his tiny
cheap-brooch eyes glinting in
appraisement of the miles of
rich weeds and butter-factories
and timber-mills through which
he is in a few years to drive
a train, perhaps the very one
he is now driven in. You see
him? . . . blond, clean as
veal, exercising those emotions
that work in pairs, ambition
and self-distrust, curiosity and
uneasiness, hope and alarm.
Do the sleepless, the wide-
awake dying, the woman in
labor, the telephone-girl on
night-duty, the late reader, the
insomniac debtor, the youth
entangled in prayer, the adul-
terers under the river-bank
horse-chestnuts, the high-school
teacher correcting algebra, the
saxophone player limping home-
wards, do they all really know,
when they hear the whistle
that bores the night like an
enchanted gimlet, what travels
in with their returning flesh-
and-blood, with Auntie Ettie
or the fourth-generation Aus-
tralian baby brother? Or
what else tomorrow might
bring besides an aunt’s coarse
gossip and new nappies on
the rotary-clothesline by the
unsatisfactory lemon-tree in the
backyard?
HTomorrow is still, of course,
the fancy-dress football-
match, Thatcher’s Summer
Sale of Men’s Wear, the C.W.A.
raffia-work display, the Legacy
dinner, the Chess Club final,
the Buffaloes’ booze-up, the
Library Committee meeting,
the C.A.E. Mozart evening at
the Prince Regent, the rock-
’n’-roll in the Mechanics’. . .
tomorrow is still tomorrow
and a repetition of customary
yesterdays. The kilties sack-
doodle, the band practises
“Poet and Peasant” overture,
the trout-fishing opens, the
duck-shooting closes, black-
berrying is on, mushrooms are
everywhere, there are frost, and
thunderstorms, and north
winds like Magog’s breath . . .
why not? Tomorrow has gone
on thus for years.
Thus?
Have you seen the papers
on the notice-board outside
the police - station headed
FISCHEREI UND WILDE-
HOERDE and UFFICIO
DELLA PESCA E DELLA
CACC IA GIONE ? Have you
looked in the delicatessens
that no longer call them-
selves Small Goods but some-
times Delikatessen and seen
the tins of olive-oil, the packets
of poppy-seed and noodles, the
tinned Dutch strawberries and
spinach, the salami, the 20
kinds of cheeses, the sauer-
kraut, the spaghettini, vermi-
cellini, sopracapellini, fettucce,
ziti and calzoni ?
Who are the once-foreign,
still foreign-looking, men with
greased hair, cafe noir eyes,
and sores on the corners of
their mouths whose photo-
graphs fill the photographer’s
display-cases? And look!

As country-town people do, I
know a lot about my
country town in a common-
or-garden way ; eyes and ears
get information gratis, one
breathes-in facts, lies or
legends effortlessly without
needing to nosey-parker—to
use the jargon—writerwise.
I know where, 30-odd years
later, watercress still grows;
I know that the town-clerk
keeps whisky in his safe ; I
know who committed suicide
why, when, how and where,
whose illegitimate baby is the
blow - in, blow - out rodeo
“Toss you for him!"
guitarist’s, why the widow So-
and-So paddles alone more and
more riotously into the sherry
pond; I know those who
occupy, convinced of their
taste, the sauternes-and-lobster-
mayonnaise belt with its beer-
label-decorated lampshades as
closely as * the claret-and-
Dylan-Thomas belt whose one-
upmanship recipes for onion-
soup and fried rice are crowned
by the wooden pepper-mill.
I know, in short, much—but
far, far from all—an abridged
encyclopaedia of human facts
that, however expurgated or
miscolored, do proceed from
an A to a Z. I know the
building, now a dolichos-
covered shed, which housed the
machinery heart of the town’s
own electric supply, a heart
that pulsed as busily, unfalter-
ingly and convincingly as any
earnest flesh-enclosed heart
throughout the nights that
made me what I am, building
me minute by minute towards
now and tomorrow.
I know that, tomorrow, if
I am or you are by chance
near St. John’s Church of Eng-
land which looks over the river-
willows, across the lucerne
flats to the Old People’s Village
on the hill, it will amuse us to

“They’re racing at Darwin!"
By
GORDON V. KEENAN
i Racing at
; Darwin” —so the
JL headlines ran a month
or two ago. Memories
raced back to me . . . Darwin
Races were the very first race-
meeting I ever attended. Dad
had a horse running in the
Ladies’ Bracelet: The Chow.
It’s well over 50 years ago.
I remember the day Dad
bought The Chow. I was still
young enough to need a sleep
after lunch. Dad must have
got dressed and away while I
was asleep.
I was tagging along after
Mother, at our new house at
Pine Creek, when I noticed
Dad at the slip-rails. I said to
Mother, “There’s Dad at the
rails with a funny old horse,
with his funny white clothes on,
and his hat’s not on straight.”
When Dad led the horse up
to the veranda Mother said in
her quietest voice: “There’s
not a bush between here and
the Katherine that hasn’t got
three horses’ rumps sticking
out of it at midday and two of
the three are branded V 56.
And that’s not enough; you
have to buy another one.”
Dad straightened his hat:
“It’s all right, this is a race-
horse. Going to win the little
Woman the Darwin Bracelet
at the next Darwin Races. I
bought him out in front of the
pub. Police were having a
deadman’s-effects sale. The
Chinaman who was bringing
him up from the Alice for the
Darwin Races died on the
track, so the police were sell-
ing the effects.”
“Pity the horse didn’t die,”
Mum chipped in.
Dad turned away at that:
“He only cost seventy-bob.
That won’t break us.”
A long, long time after, or so
*** it seemed to me—it was
when I was between four and
five years old—we were at the
Darwin Races. The Chow was
still entered in the Bracelet. Dad
had scratched him from the
Cup—he didn’t fancy his
chances against Bill Laurie’s
Sir General Bullar, £ 1500-
worth of imported English
thoroughbred. Sir General
Bullar was entered in the
Bracelet, but I don’t think Dad
dared scratch The Chow, for
fear of what Mother would say.
Sir General Bullar carried
the number-one saddlecloth;
The Chow was No. 5. No one
fancied The Chow, not even
Dad.
Just before the race Mother
said to her friend, “I’ve a
husband and two big sons
here, and when I want them
all I’ve got is the baby. There’s
some silly rule about a woman
not being allowed to bet on the
tote”—then she looked at me
where I was sitting with her
friend’s little girl—“here, son,
take this five-shilling piece”
(a cartwheel they called them)
“and go down to that little
window, put it on the ledge.
and say, ‘One on Number Five,
please,’ and wait until the man
gives you a ticket, and bring it
straight back to me.”
I had no trouble following
the instructions. I’d just got
the ticket, and before I could
turn around someone picked
me up and lifted me level with
the window, and the voice
behind me said, “Maybe it’s
hard to tell majors from minors,
Mac, but this you should know
—fresh out of a pram, and you
bet with it!”
The man in the tote said,
“I never seen that Mr.
Stretton.”
“You never seen it, as you
say—he could hardly reach up
to put the money on the ledge.”
Mr. Stretton, who was the
Chief of Police, carried me back
from the window a piece, and
gave me to a trooper: “I don’t
suppose you know who he
belongs to?”
“No, Mr. Stretton, but I
could try an’ find out.”
“Do that, then. I’ll have
something to say to whoever
sent that to bet.”
The trooper knelt down
and asked me my name. I told
him. I said, “Mother said I
was to bring the ticket straight
back.”
The trooper reported to Mr.
Stretton. That was how I came
to lead the Chief of Police to
where Mother was sitting on
the stand.
Mr. Stretton started off
about her having sent a little
boy to bet, etc., but he didn’t
get far.
Mother said: “He’s a male,
isn’t he? As a woman’s not
allowed to bet, I sent the only
male I had handy. Come to
that, it’s my husband’s money,
which is the same thing isn’t
it? The boy was merely a
messenger carrying his father’s
money. Do you think we’ll all
be ruined if we lost the five-
shillings? Hasn’t the police-
force something better to do
than harass honest folk down
on holidays, having a bit of
fun after living out ‘back o’
beyond’ for years? First races
we come to, here’s the police
treating us like cattle-duffers or
something Won’t you please
go away? If you’re worried
about this ticket you can have
it.”
Mother proffered him the
ticket.
As the Chief of Police
blundered down past me where
I was sitting on the steps, he
had a look on his face that I’d
seen on a man’s face before,
a man who had been kicked in
the stomach by a mule.
A/Tother’s friend's little girl
-*-*-*- came and sat with me on
the steps.
She had a bag of caramels
and I had a bag of peanuts, so
we got along fine. Only she
had a strange habit of putting
one arm around my neck, and
putting her lips against mine,
and making a funny smacking
noise.
This was all new to me ; no
one had ever done that to me
before. Her lips were very soft
and seemed to cling. Maybe
the caramels helped.
Then I was sitting on Dad’s
shoulders, and told to look for
The Chow.
There was a loud shout of,
“They're off!” and a blurred
mass of colors and horses going
away from us, and in time
they turned a corner and even
I could see The'Chow. Dad
was yelling, “The Chow!
Come on, The Chow!” waving
his hat with one hand and
pounding the rail in front with
the other. I was hanging-on
to Dad’s ear with one hand and
pounding the top of Dad’s head
with the other, and yelling,
“Come on The Chow!”
Then I was standing down,
and Mother was saying, “You
would scratch him out of the
Cup! He could have won the

Old Bill Laurie came along
just then and said “The drinks
are on you, Joe.”
I said, “I’m thirsty, too,
Mum” ; so Mother said, “You’d
best take him with you.”
Maybe she thought my
presence would keep hats on
straight.
Down at the bar, the man
asked if I liked lemonade, and
I said, “Yes, please”; and

The ’Sixties Are Here
Possibly because of some trait of
tidiness that lurks unsuspected in
the disorderliness of the human
make-up, historians and others
tend to parcel-up the years in neat
bundles of ten, as if each decade were
complete in itself, owing nothing to the
one that came before it and giving
nothing to its successor. Thus when we
of the Hungry ’Forties or the
N hty ’Nineties we accept the terms
’id descriptions of the periods,
g the fact that plenty of people
wen nungry to bed in 1839 and 1850
and that pleasant wickedness didn’t
emerge full-fledged from the egg on New
Year’s Day, 1890, or fly away forever
at midnight on the closing day of the
nineteenth century.
But although we like to pin labels on
the decades, it isn’t easy to do it while
they are still with us, or even 10 or 20
years later. Men now middle-aged find
it hard to think of the 1920’s as the
Roaring ’Twenties, the name bestowed
by American writers on the decade which
began with the ratification of the
Versailles Treaty and ended with the
Wall Street crash. Yet perhaps it is not
inept.
It is far too early yet to give a name
to the 1950’5. And who can guess what
sort of label posterity will tie on the
1960’5? If economic prophets in the
U.S. are right, they are already “the
Golden ’Sixties.” These expectations
are based on the belief that the tech-
nological advances of the past 20 years
are just about to bear fruit, and that
all the capital that has been tied-up in
their development will now begin to pay
rich dividends. Also, a rise of 63 p.c.
in the teenage population is anticipated
during the 10 years, with a lift in the
total U.S. population from 178 million
to 208 million. The new “young-
married” population between 1965 and
1970 is expected to have a profound
impact on the U.S. economy.
A Hundred Years Ago
'T'he decade which began a century ago
did not stand out in Australian
history as some others have done. This,
after all, is not surprising, as it followed
a decade which definitely does mean
something in the annals of this country.
The 1850's saw two happenings which
shaped events in Australia for the rest
of the century. These were the discovery
of gold and the coming of responsible
government. The Golden ’Fifties were
10 years filled with so much change that
the decade which followed had of neces-
sity to be one of recuperation and
digestion.
In the year 1860 the population of the
six colonies was 1,145,585, compared
with only 405,356 10 years earlier. The
greater portion of this increase was due
to immigration— to the inrush of gold-
seekers which began as soon as the news
of the Ballarat diggings reached the
other side of the world. In the year
1852 nearly 88,000 immigrants arrived
in Australia and a yearly average of
50,000 was maintained over the whole
decade. Most of the newcomers went
to Victoria, which by 1855 had a bigger
population than the whole of Australia
had possessed at the time gold was dis-
covered in 1851. It was 40 years before
N. S. Wales resumed its position as the
most populous Australian colony.
In 1860, when the total immigration
to the colonies fell to 24,000, the N.S.W.
intake was only 3671, which is probably
the reason why Flenry Parkes and W. B.
Dailey were sent to England in the fol-
lowing year as ‘‘emigration lecturers.”
Possibly as a result of their efforts the
average intake rose to 5000 over the next
three years ; but Victoria still continued
to attract newcomers at two or three
times that rate, though by no means on
the scale of the ’fifties.
A century later two things about the
immigrant invasion of the gold-rush
period still seem rather amazing. The
first is that the shipping of the period,
mostly windjammers, was able to cope
with the task of bringing half-a-million
people out here in ten years ; the second
is how the economy of the country was
able to absorb such numbers in addition
to the natural increase of the colonies.
This absorption was, of course, the main
task of the 1860’s. Gold was still being
produced in large quantities, but on a
declining scale; it was not until the
’nineties, with the Westrajian goldfields
in full production, that the output of the
peak year, 1858, was again reached.
After the Gold-rush
nPHE effect of the gold-rush on the
agricultural development of Aus-
tralia was twofold. First there was a
decline in the area under cultivation as
farmers left their holdings to join the
hunt for gold. Then, as the huge influx
of population made food scarce and
prices high, there was a return to the
land as men realised that mining was a
chancy business and that gold, if won
at all, could only be won once, whereas
fertile land, properly handled, could keep
on paying dividends year after year.
In the mid-’fifties the acreage under
crop was considerably below 500,000;
by 1860 it exceeded a million, with both
Victoria and South Australia leading
N.S.W. in cultivated acreage. The actual
area cropped in the season 1860-61 was
1,174,000 acres, equivalent to one acre
per head of population. The area in-
creased steadily throughout the ’sixties,
and by the end of the decade reached
2,144,000 acres.
Along with the expansion of agricul-
ture, though in many ways opposed to
it, came an extension of the pastoral
industry. In 1860 the sheep population
of the colonies stood at 20 million. By
1870 it had more than doubled —the
tally was 41 million. With other types
of livestock the increase was not so
Wool was already an im-
portant export, but the frozen-meat trade
at that time existed only in the mind of
T. S. Mort. Hides were exportable, but
meat-production was for the home-mai
ket only. Most of the present cattle
country was still undeveloped; muci
of it unexplored.
It was in 1860 that Burke and Will
left Melbourne on their expedition t
the Gulf of Carpentaria, perishing o
the return journey. In 1861 Job
McDouall Stuart reached the cent!
of the continent, raising the flag on wha
is now known as Central Mount Stuari
though he named it after Charles Stur
In the following year Stuart reached Po;
Darwin.
The expansion of agriculture and ii
competition with the pastoral industi
presented one of the biggest problen
confronting the Governments of tl
’sixties. Two far-reaching land-laws wer
passed in that period. In 1862 Roben
son’s Land Act, which provided for “fre
selection before survey,” came into fore
in N.S.W. and was later copied in moi
of the other colonies. Its intentions wen
good, but it failed dismally in its primar
object of establishing a rural econom
of smallholders. The other piece c
legislation, the Torrens-title for lane
transfers, was enacted in South Australi
in 1857, but by 1862 it had been adopte
also in N.S.W., Victoria, Queensland an
Tasmania, so it belongs by right to tl
’sixties.
Other unconnected but significac
events of the decade included the Lamt)
ing Flat riots and the regulation o
Chinese immigration into N.S.W. (1861)
the opening of the first tramway i
Sydney (1861); the first inter-Colonii
conference in Melbourne (1863); th
crushing of the first crop of Queenslan
sugarcane (1864); and the arrival of tb
last convict ship, the Hougomont, i
Westralia (1868). And, of course, tb
first Melbourne Cup (1861).
Next Ten Years
Tn a way the 1950’s had much ii
common with the 1850’s. There was a
great discovery of‘gold, but the influ
of oversea capital and industries int(
the country had inflationary effects tha
were not greatly dissimilar. And tb
revival of immigration on a grand seal
made changes in the composition of tb
population that may be as far-reaching ii
their effect as was the inflow of gold
seekers a century ago.
It may be that this inflow of peopl
and capital and the building-up atf
development of industries will continu
on the same scale throughout the 1960’s
If the American economists are rigb
and the disaster of war is avoided then
is no reason why it shouldn’t. But Ui
economic prophets aren’t always right"
they were wrong with unbelievabb
unanimity in 1929 —and it could be tha
for Australia this decade, like its counter
part of last century, will be a time o ;
sober consolidation, while the countr!
digests the gains of the ’Fifties. Which
ever it is, the ’Seventies will tell us.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
A CRICKETER'S
REVERIE
[lndulged in by Patrick Connor,
of Indore, India]
Australian cricketers
have played nowhere near
the Central Indian city where
I eke out a precarious living
selling pencils—but that dis-
mays me not at all, because
for years I have been watching
Test-matches in the vast and
tumultuous arena of my mind.
The fascinating thing about
these Homeric struggles is that
I broadcast the match and
also go in first wicket down
for Australia. Bradman’s old
position. Australia was for-
tunate to discover me when
the Don retired.
There has been a good deal
of speculation in the press
since O’Neill hove over the
horizon as to whether my
lapidary stroke-making might
not serve the team better lower
down the list —say, at No. 4.
On the eve of the Australian
team’s departure from India
this problem has still not been
solved.
O’Neill, by the way, has
come to me several times for
advice, and I have given it to
him readily, all charm and
humility and eagerness to help
a youngster along, though I am
still in the springtime of youth
myself, albeit a shrewd,
crinkly-eyed veteran of 50
Test-matches and a thousand
days in the sun.
I am seen at my best in a
crisis, when the ship is sink-
ing with all hands ; when, say,
the first wicket has gone for
two, and there is a suspicious-
looking patch of green on the
wicket that was not there
during the three days that Eng-
land were amassing 463, despite
seven impossible catches taken
by me at leg-slip and cover-
point. (The other members of
the Australian team had stood
back, after this already
legendary performance, to let
me go through the pavilion-
gate first after the last English
wicket had fallen.)
That sort of thing often
happens to me, and it is sur-
prising that I am not insuffer-
ably conceited, whereas I am
still the same unassuming, dis-
armingly frank country-lad
who came to the city from the
rude uplands a few years ago
and made 435 n.-o. in his first
inter-State match. The crowds
have taken me to their hearts.
The broadcasting men, with
their unerring taste for the mot
juste, always call me the
“darling of the crowd,” which
sums-up the situation perfectly.
I am looking forward to the
future with consuming interest,
since, with O'Neill coming in
behind me, I shall not feel the
whole weight of the Australian
innings weighing on my back.
Neville Cardus once referred
to me, in sympathetic terms,
as the “Atlas of post-war
cricket.” On the rare occa-
“I know a wonderful short-cut through the bush."
sions on which I have failed
to score it has always been in
the first innings, and I have
invariably taken a terrible,
piratical vengeance on the
“hapless” bowlers in the
second.
Freddy Trueman, with
whom I have had a hundred
mortal duels, says, with a rue-
ful smile on his plug-ugly face:
“I just don’t know what to
bowl to him. I just let it go
as fast as I can and pray.”
All cricket-writers acknow-
ledge that I am the only Aus-
tralian batsman that Jim Laker
has failed to trouble, and in
his book published last year,
Twenty Years a Silly Mid-on,
Jim himself admits it. Inci-
dentally, Jim is a bonhomous
fellow on and off the field. He
likes his jug of ale and is a
great practical joker. Ours is
a friendly rivalry, and the
banter that goes on when I
come to bat is something, I
can tell you.
I have not reduced my life
to print yet, but I have already
chosen the title. The book
will be called The Third Man
—or Linger With Me In the
Gully Awhile. This meister-
werk will not be written by
me (there is nothing cerebral
about me), but will be ghosted
by that most imaginative of
cricket-writers, Mr. Leontzini,
of the “Times of India,” who
in the past year has made
several notable, though abor-
tive, attempts to disprove the
ancient philosophical maxim,
ex nihilo, nihil fit (nothing can
come from nothing). This
germ of erudition was injected
into me by Neville Cardus,
whom I once asked for a list
of books to improve my- mind
with. Of all the books he lent
me the one I liked best was A
Study of Hysteria in the
Twentieth-century, as Mirrored
in the Writings of the Cricket
Writers of England, a doctoral
thesis by a certain Sidney
Barnes, of Australia.
Like most cricketers who
have carved their own niche
in Fame’s Frieze, I have often
been asked to choose my World
XI for a mythical match
against an Invading XI from
Mars or the Moon. Here is
my World XI, with reasons
given for my choices. It took
me a good solid three minutes
to choose it:
Sid Barnes (A.) —to make effective
appeals against the light.
Neville Cardus (Danes.) —to prop
np t'he morale of the side by tell-
ing them how beautifully they
play.
Myself (A.) —for my genius.
D. R. Jardine (E.) —for HIS genius.
D. G. Bradman (A.) —in case the
side is keen on winning.
Sir Pelham Warner (E.) —to keep
peace between Jardine and the
Don.
D. Tallon (A.) —because he's a
friend of mine.
Tj. Armanath (I.) —for his demoral-
ising wrong-footed bowling.
G. Allen (E.) —to take photographs
of the opposition’s bowlers'
dragging. ,
A. L. Hassett (A.)—for hi# super-
naturall.v subtle slow-bowling.
H. Larwood (E.) —In ease tho side
is keen on winning.
12tb man—the Duke of Edinburgh.
Baggage-man—Eord Hawke.
One last word about my
batting-style. It is a synthesis
of Hammond’s artistry, Brad-
man’s concentration (every-
ball-is-for-me-the-first-ball-and-
I-never-visualise-the-possibility-
of-onvone'-getting-me-out sort
of thing), Hutton’s canniness
and Compton’s panache.
My best stroke is a sort of
leisurely back-cut, requiring
the acme of timing and a high
degree of showmanship.
In most of my innings I am
“unfortunately run out.” In
fact, the large number of
deficient and hesitant callers in
cricket nowadays is the despair
of the broadcasting-box, to
which we are now taking you
for a description of the first
day’s play in the Test-match
. . take it away, Arthur!
* * *
Whether or not as a result of
the illustrious Connor’s fabu-
lous advice, O’Neill left his
own previous best (233) well
behind in belting the Presi-
dent's XI bowling for 284
(33 fours and three over the
fence) in a drawn game at
Ahmedabad.

Soundly defeating Australia
by 119 runs at Kanpur in the
second cricket Test, India
registered its first Test win
against either Australia or England.
Apart from McDonald and Harvey
(in both innings) and Davidson
and Stevens in the first
innings, Australia’s batsmen failed
badly. Mackay got a “pair”—
second time he’d got a Test “pair
(in the fourth Test at Manchester
in 1956 he twice failed to Laker),
India’s win was mainly due to
fine bowling by Patel, playing in
a Test for the first time since
being dropped after failing in the
first and second Tests against
Australia in 1956. This time he
took 9-69 in Australia’s first innings
and 5-55 in the second, when he
was ably supported by medium-
pacer Umrigar’s 4-27.
Australia’s most successful bowler
was Davidson, whose 7-93 off a
remarkable 57.3 overs in India s
second innings followed his 5-31
off 21.1 overs in the first innings.
India’s top-scorer was opening-
bat Nariman Contractor, with a
74 in India’s second innings (he
was in India's second-innings
opening stand of 121 in the first
Test).

219 and 105.
“Veryl”: Norm O’Neill may
have done the right thing for him-
self, from a business point of view,
by not playing in the Lancashire
League next season, but I won’t
have it, as has been claimed, that
he would not have benefited him-
self, cricketically speaking. O’Neill’s
pretty good now, of course, but
if he' wouldn’t have benefited still
further he’d have been the first
Australian not to have improved
from a season in Lancashire
League. Among quite a few others
Jim Burke’s season in 1954 brought
him regular Test selection for Aus-
tralia the following season, Lindwall
developed his swing, while Bob
Simpson himself acknowledges that
his great start to this season’s
Shield games was largely due to
his having played last season in
the League.
* * *
Melbourne Racing
The most improved galloper
in Melbourne is Prince Da-
homey, far too good for his
rivals in the Bagot Handicap
at Flemington on New Year’s
Day. It was a third successive
win for the five-year-old geld-
ing since he passed into the
hands of Pakenham trainer
Ray Webster a few weeks ago.
Now Prince Dahomey is being
thought of as a Cup horse,
with the £12,500 Sydney Cup
at Randwick in April as his
immediate mission, and the
£25,000 Centenary Melbourne
Cup in the distance. Ray
Webster does not overrate his
charges, and if he thinks
Prince Dahomey is a Cup
proposition his opinion must
be respected. Webster has
already won a Melbourne Cup,
with Dark Felt in 1943, and a
Caulfield Cup, with Counsel
in 1944.
Prince Dahomey, who was bred
by V.R.C. chairman Sir Chester
Manifold, has stout blood in his
veins. His sire, Angus, got
Arbroath, winner of an Australian
Cup and V.R.C. St. Leger, while his
dam, Arresting, was by Melbourne
Cup winner Sirius.
Planetoid, who is very good
at his best, came right away
for an easy win in the Standish
Handicap at Flemington. It
had been a year since Plane-
toid, who was a brilliant
youngster, won a race ; he has
been mulish, and has given
trainer Bob Clarion a lot of
headaches. Just 10 years ago
Clarion trained another
Standish winner, Chal.
Planetoid's good win emphasised
the quality of Prince Lea. At
Caulfield on Boxing Day Prince
Lea defeated Planetoid in the
Christmas Handicap, and it seems
certain that Prince Lea, who was
scratched from the Standish, will
play a prominent part in the
important sprint-events of the
autumn.
Those punters at Flemington
who took short odds about
Milverton winning the Strad-
broke Stakes may have been
unfortunate to lose their
money. The gelding struck his
head on the stalls, lost ground
at the start, and finished a
close second to Grasse.
Milverton’s winning turn is not
far off. However, Grasse is a very
good filly. She has all the pace
of the Meadow Mist breed, and
her owner-breeder, Sir Chester
Manifold, has hopes that she will
win the five-furlongs w.-f.-a.
Lightning Stakes for him. A couple
of years ago another Meadow Mist
two-year-old, Misting, won the
Lightning for Sir Chester’s wife and
daughter. Melbourne’s leading
jockeys have done well at the New
Year’s Day fixture. Bill William-
son’s success in the Standish was
his fourth in that event, and Jack
Purtell, who rode Grasse in the
Stradbroke, had won that race
three times previously.
There were some interesting
youngsters in the Puckle Handi-
cap (two-year-olds ; five furlongs)
at the Saturday meeting at Moonee
Valley. One was the romantically-
bred Comicquita, a son of those
great rivals Comic Court and
Chicquita. Owner Sam Calvert
paid 4800gns. for Comicquita ;
there was no money for the colt,
who started at 50 to 1, but he ran
a useful race to finish in the middle
of the field. Trainer Tony Lopes
realises that Comicquita needs time
to mature, and the colt may not
have his second start for some time.
Far Out, one of the youngsters
bought by Fred Astaire while he
was here to make “On the Beach,”
also contested the Puckle, and did
well to finish third after leading
early. Trainer Stan Murphy will
be able to assure Astaire with
reasonable confidence that this
Star Kingdom filly will win races.
The winner of the Puckle
was Egoline, having only his
second race. At his first start
Egoline had been backed for
a lot of money at long odds,
and his connections were un-
lucky not to collect, as the
gelding ran into considerable
trouble that day. On Saturday
Egoline finished like a good
horse to win narrowly from
the promising Mojave.
Egoline is a gelding by Nullabor
from Revaura, and is raced by
well-known owner P. Grant Hay
and his wife. It was a first
training-success for Richard Alsop,
who has had his licence only seven
months, but who learnt a lot about
the game under Maurice McCarten’s
direction before going to England
and France for added experience.
The majority of punters at
Moonee Valley adjourned to
the bar or the tearooms while
betting was in progress on the
first heat of the Belinda Handi-
cap ; but a few intrepid souls
laid 3 to 1 on La Josephina.
At the turn they would have
cheerfully swopped their tickets
to get their money back. At
that stage Lady Aspen, who
had led from bafrier-rise, was
going strongly in front, and
the favorite was not showing
much response to Ron Hutchin-
son’s whip. Over the last little
bit, however, La Josephina
struggled on to snatch the ver-
dict by a head in a photo-
finish.
There is no doubt that La
Josephina is a smart filly—-she has
won six races, and at her previous
start had finished a close third to
outstanding sprinters Prince Lea and
Planetoid. The inference is that
Lady Aspen, who has done most
of her limited racing in the country,
will soon take a city race.
Winner of the second
Bolinda, the Landau - Janeo
filly Landelle had shown a
good deal of promise in her
previous racing without manag-
ing a win. She’s one of several
of the Landau stock raced
successfully by the owner of
that sire, V.R.C. committee-
man E. A. Underwood, and
is a half-sister to Cromis, who
was a first-class galloper in
Australia but a failure when
he subsequently raced in
America. There is not much
size to Landelle, and she has
given trainer Bob Sinclair a
good deal of worry trying to
get her robust enough to win
a race. .Now that she has
broken-through, Sinclair in-
tends to give Landelle a long
spell.
• • • •
There are not many more-
promising sprinters in Mel-
bourne than Small Time. This
three-year-old Smokey Eyes
colt has an excellent record
against his own age, but at
the Valley he stepped up to
open company, and, although
conceding weight to the older
horses, had no trouble to beat
that useful measuring-stick
Nevana.
On Guard cannot strike form in
Melbourne. This former Westralian
horse, who has a fine record in
his home State, and who raced
well on a visit to Sydney, started
in the Standish Handicap at
Flemington and in the Aberfeldie
Handicap at the Valley, and,
although well-backed for both
races, he performed only moder-
ately. His trainer, B. W. Allpike,
thinks Melbourne handicappers
have too high an opinion of the
horse.
The Aberfeldie went to Good
Summer, a New Zealand-bred
Summertime gelding, who, true
to his name, races best on a
hard track. There are not
many better-looking horses
about than Good Summer, who
is a showy chestnut, and
earlier in his career it was
thought he might be very
good. However, he does not
like weight, and as soon as he
gets over 9st. he finds it hard
to win a handicap.

Svdney Horses
Riding in exceptionally good
form at the moment, Jack
Thompson was seen at his best
in winning Tattersall’s Cup on
Essayist at the Randwick New
Year’s Day meeting. The
crowd didn’t appreciate it,
reckoning Essayist’s form too
much of an improvement on
his showing in the Summer
Cup. In this latter event,
though, Essayist suffered a
clear check when Gay Satin
broke-down in front of him.
Dual Copy, favorite for the
Tatt.’s Cup event, ran much
below form, and is to be
spelled.
One of the most promising
winners at the Tatt.’s meeting
was the Star Kingdom (imp.)

year-old Star Kingdom filly
is likely to make it tough for
the best of them in Victoria’s
rich autumn sprints. The
Oakleigh Plate is to be run
on February 27 and the New-
market on March 12. Gay
Port, too, has never been fitter,
and is one of Sydney’s best
sprinters; and Randwick-
record holder Front Cover is
also ready for further good
wins. These and one or two
other Sydneysiders should help
to make the big sprint double
exceptionally interesting this
year.
Star Mystery’s form wasn’t
much better than Bonne Vic-
toire’s for the Canterbury
Maiden for two-year-old fillies,
but for some reason she was
preferred in the betting to
Morrie Point’s good-looking
Nilo (imp.) filly. At no stage,
however, did Star Mystery
look like winning, though she
managed to run on into third
place. The finish between
Bonne Victoire, on the outside,
and > Queen Naurah, on the
rails, was so close that
hundreds queued to examine
the photo-finish picture. Bonne
Victoire’s dam, Bonita (Fr.),
is by Victrix from Bella by
Bois Roussel. The filly is
related to Argur, winner of the
Eclipse Stakes in England.
American owner F. C.
Rand, jnr., paid 4000gns. for
Star Glimpse, easy winner of
the Canterbury Maiden for
two-year-old colts and geld-
ings. Due to be shipped to
America soon with Rand’s
other yearling purchases —
Australian Star and Clem's
Cousin, each of whom cost
him 5000gns. —Star Glimpse
is by Star Kingdom (imp.)
from Fleeting Glance by Le
Grand Due (Fr.) from Blue
Sox by Double Remove (imp.).
Melbourne Cup winners Wind-
bag and Evening Peal, and
Metropolitan winners Loqua-
cious and Feminist all figure
in Star Glimpse’s pedigree.
Time for his win—63sec. —
was a race record, and was
close to the best for the course
(1-2 i).

Yet another Star Kingdom,
Sonar King, won brilliantly at
Canterbury, outclassing the
opposition in the Second Ash-
bury Stakes, and covering the
six furlongs in 1.11 9/10, which
compared favorably with
Endure’s 1.11 3/10 in the Fly-
ing. Raced by Mr. and Mrs.
W. S. Lamb, and costing
4700gns. as a yearling, he’s
from Echo by Double Remove
(imp.) from Tittle Tattle by
Constant Son (imp.).
Prior to winning her first city
race in the Canterbury Park
First Ashbury Stakes, Gay
Smile had been best known at
provincial fixtures, where she
had frequently been taken by
trainer Sid Nicholls and had
won four minor races, three
of them at Hawkesbury by big
margins. Raced by Len Burke,
she’s a. three-year-old by Nilo
(imp.) from Captivate by
Golden Sovereign (imp.). Cap-
tivate, who has thrown several
other winners, is a sister to
former speedsters Merrie
Merton and Warspite.

Kaywana, winner of the
Second Albion Park Maiden
in Brisbane at the weekend,
has an imported sire and dam
—he’s a three-year-old gelding
by Signalman from Turkita. A
smart two-year-old was pro-
duced at the Eagle Farm fixture
on New Year’s Day —Grand
Surrey, trained by Bill Bris-
coe for J. H. Blakeney. The
youngster is by Landau (imp.)
from Swadeshi by Dhoti
(imp.) from Phrygia by Fel-
stead. Landau, of course, is
getting many winners, mostly
in Melbourne. A smart per-
former in England, he’s by
Derby-winner Dante.
“Dial FX”: People who
feared that Randwick race-
course would corner the spare
telephone-lines available in
that area may breathe again—
Mr. Dwyer’s s.p.-betting busi-
ness on the course (started in a
burst of publicity) isn’t doing
so well, and, on turnover to
date, other bookmakers won’t
be asking for lines, thank
you, now or in the future. In
fact, it’s doubtful if Mr. Dwyer,
or the A.J.C., will see the full
12-months trial-period right
out. Whatever the rights or
wrongs of legal off-the-course
betting may be, the system
under trial has attracted serious
response only from the distant,
elderly and exceptional few.

Dick Gilkes on a pleasantly
cool setting:
The Bth Olympic Winter Games,
to be held at Squaw Valley, Cali-
fornia, next month, will be in the
heart of America’s snow-country,
in the Sierra Nevada Ranges, the
highest mountains in the U.S.
Squaw Valley, which I saw 12
months go, is a natural amphi-
theatre about two miles long and
half-a-mile wide. The floor alone
is over 6000 ft. above sea-level, and
at the time of the Games it will
be covered by about 9ft. of snow.
All accommodation and adminis-
tration facilities, the ski-courses
and three skatjng-rinks are tailor-
made for the Games, having been
completely constructed jn the last
18 months. The 700-odd competing
athletes from 34 countries (27 from
Australia, including five skiers)
will all live within five-minutes
walking of the location of the major
events.
The main ski-events will be held
on the slopes of three mountains
forming the end and one side ot
the valley, Squaw Peak, Papoose
Peak and KT-22. The Men’s
Downhill will be held on Squaw
Peak, over a two-mile course which
drops half-a-mile in altitude.
Competitors will ski at over 80
miles an hour on some sections
of the course, which gives some
idea of the physical demands on
the top-line skiers.

“Zorok”: “Haddo” (B. 23/12/’59)
understates the position. By then
selfish “no-transfer” list, Sydney
Rugby League clubs are showing
no concern for N.S.W. Country
League. But Sydney clubs, too,
could get “in bother.” Country
clubs can also refuse transfers (for
instance, of Kangaroo Brian
Hambly, of Wagga, wanted by
several Sydney clubs). Sydney
Rugby League should emulate Mel-
bourne Aussie Rules, where a club
cannot refuse a clearance, to a
country coaching position, to any
player who has turned 28 and
played 100 games for the club.
That way the game benefits all
round. It means that individuals
get lucrative coaching jobs, country
clubs get a close-to-the-top man
as player-coach, young countrymen
get good coaching, and the big
city clubs thus get almost “ready-
made” stars from the country.
Incidentally, N.S.W. Rugby League
should beware it does not lose
the Riverina to Aussie Rules, which
is making inroads there through the
policy just mentioned.

BRITAIN AND SOUTH AFRICA
'T'he British Labor party's
unsuccessful attempt in
Parliament to extract an out-
right Government condemna-
tion of apartheid, coming not
long before the commence-
ment of Prime Minister Mac-
millan’s African tour, caused
some U.K. leader-writers to
ponder the problem of what
shape Britain’s relations with
the Union should take.
Outlining the Government’s
reasons for refusing to con-
demn apartheid officially, Lon-
don “Economist” notes that
“the majority against South
Africa is prepared to condemn
oppression only when the
oppression is on grounds of
color; country after country
that joins in condemning South
Africa’s domestic policy is run
by an oppressive Government
which would righteously resist
any attempt by the United
Nations to judge it. This is a
doubtful bandwagon to jump
on.
“The second reason is that
Britain is itself vulnerable
through the responsibility it
has for territories in which
the problem of color-discrimi-
nation, with or without politi-
cal oppression, is unsolved.
The intention is, of course, to
solve it; and when this has
been done —whether in Kenya,
Nyasaland or Northern Rho-
desia (or North Kensington)—
it will be time enough to make
official holier-than-thou pro-
nouncements.
“The peculiar problem which
South Africa presents is that
it is not only a sovereign State
practising color-discrimination
as a way of life, but it is also
the only State which is unre-
pentantly increasing that dis-
crimination. This is not true
of the southern States of the
United States, or, to take a
Commonwealth instance, of the
application of the ‘White Aus-
tralia policy.’ Even Southern
Rhodesia is moving in a direc-
tion against racialism.
“In short, South Africa

sticks out like a sore thumb
in a world in which non-white
States are increasingly in-
fluential —especially when act-
ing in concert —and very sensi-
tive. This is a reason why
there will have to be a term
to Britain’s official line.
“The tragedy of [the Parlia-
mentary] debate was that ill-
informed or ill-disposed non-
white people the world over
will infer from the defeat of
the Labor motion that the
Government favors apartheid.
Nothing could be more untrue.
But the Government should
rely on its own actions in its
own bailiwick to prove it;
there will be opportunity
enough in 1960.”
Other comment:
Edinburg h “Scotsman”:
“According to the ‘Times,’ the
frontiers of the permissible ih
British criticism of the South
African Government have been
more and more crossed. When
the Government of a State
within this multi-racial Com-
monwealth so abandons the
elementary principles to which
all the others subscribe, criti-
cism is bound to exceed what
is normal, and indeed it ought
to do so. The oppressed
majority of the South African
population are voteless and
need whatever moral support
the rest of the world can give
to them in their plight.
“The danger that South
Africa will leave the Com-
monwealth, if it is a danger,
is a minor matter in compari-
son. The fact is that the Com-
monwealth connection is far
more valuable to South Africa
than is the connection with
South Africa to most members
of the Commonwealth. The
South African Government is
highly sensitive, for trade and
diplomatic reasons, to criticism
abroad, as its recent efforts to
present itself in a less tyranni-
cal guise have shown.”
* * *
London “Observer”: “In
many ways it would be an
advantage to the Common-
wealth as a whole if South
Africa were to leave it alto-
gether. It is certainly not in
the interests of Britain to keep
her in at all costs, though it
may be in the interests of
South Africa to stay at all
costs. Without the Common-
wealth, South Africa would be
isolated indeed.
“But that is not the end of
the matter. The Common-
wealth is a Commonwealth
of nations, not of Gov-
ernments. Britain certainly
has some responsibility to the
South African people, both
white and black, who share
the right of British citizenship;
and if South Africa were to
leave the Commonwealth the
lot of the black Africans them-
selves would certainly be no
better, and might easily be
worse. The right policy is not
to try to get rid of South
Africa, but to use what influ-
ence we have to persuade her
white rulers to alter their
disastrous policies.”
*
London “New Statesman”:
“The sporadic outbreaks of
rioting which have erupted [in
South Africa] in recent months
are part of a general shift
away from legal opposition to
force of arms. African national
consciousness is maturing, and
the apartheid system leaves it
no outlet except violence.
“Some of Verwoerd's hench-
men foresee the clash, and
welcome it. They believe that
by slaughtering a few thousand
Africans they can inaugurate a
long period of apathetic peace.
They are preparing. Not only
are they buying large quantities
of Saracen armored-cars from
Britain, but they are also re-
organising their Army on a
territorial basis so that it can
be instantly and effectively de-
ployed to crush an uprising.
“The Defence Minister, Mr.
Erasmus, says he is stationing
‘shock-troops at strategic points
throughout the country.’ He
is purging the armed forces of
English - speaking officers,
especially those who fought
against Hitler, and replacing
them with Afrikaners, some of
whom proved their ‘loyalty
by refusing to fight against the
Nazis. Most significant of all:
certain officers have been sent
to Algeria to study French
methods of ‘pacification.’ ”
* * *
London “Time and Tide
“South Africa has little chance
of surviving a guerrilla war on
the Algerian scale. The colons
in Algeria have only been
able to remain there because of
the protection of a powerful
nation, separated from them
by no more than an overnight
journey by sea. South Africa,
whose European population
is comparable to that of
Algeria, is in this respect abso-
lutely isolated.

justified, and he has every

■Reconstruction of the Townsville-Mount Isa
railway to its full £3O-million plan is one of the
really big national decisions of recent years.
The Commonwealth Government’s agreement
to underwrite Queensland on a £2O-million loan
for the purpose, with the State finding the
remainder from its own resources, marks a major
step forward in Australia’s development.
This is the very type of large linking project
we need. And we need it for more reasons than
the doubling of Mount Isa’s rich production and
the triangulation of that fabulous mine with its
new copper smelter at Townsville and its coal
sources near Bowen
The full national worth of this line is in the
general opening it will assure to the future of the
northlands; in the further mineral discoveries it
will serve, with the Mary Kathleen uranium field
as a classic ease in point; and in its benefits to
those beef cattle lands to which it will stand in
stronger chain.
For the Mount Isa Company, turning as it is
to increased copper production to meet the
changing accents in world demand, the reinforced
line will be an incentive to go ahead on the
programme of vast expansion to which it has
been working.
By 1964 Mount Isa Mines undertakings expect
to have a combined annual export-earning capacity
of more than twice the amount this whole
reconstruction of railway is going to cost.
The call now will be for quick re-laying and
equipping of the line. Engineers of world standing
have been engaged for the planning. And the
internal financing of this project is in itself a proof
of the faith we have in our own capacity to see
it through.
In wise companion to this, the Queensland
Government is moving to build a system of feeder
roads connecting cattle areas that are out past the
terminals of its three great lateral railways.

more wealth in the Australian inland waiting

reason to know whether they
are, then we must see in South
Africa such political convul-
sions as will make the situation
in the Federation appear trivial.
It would be unwise to ignore
what Mr. Erasmus has to say.”
China and Indonesia
IN a letter to the “New York
Times,” Herbert Feith,
author of two books on
Indonesian politics, observes
London “News Chronicle.”
ECHO AND NASSERSUSS.
(Sir Anthony Eden and Colonel Nasser plan to publish their
memoirs early this year.)
that “it is an unhappy reflec-
tion on the conscience of the
non-Communist world that
virtually no voices have been
raised here [the U.S.] in
defence of the victims of the
current anti-Chinese measures
in Indonesia.
“Indeed, it is only since these
measures have led to diplo-
matic friction between Indo-
nesia and Communist China
that they have received signi-
ficant attention in the West.
But the problem here is not
Communism ; it is minority
victimisation.
“The situation is' compli-
cated, but certain facts stand
out.
“The Indonesian Govern-
ment is pushing ahead with the
implementation of its regula-
tion of last May, banning
aliens (mainly Chinese) from
operating retail enterprises in
rural areas as of January 1,
1960. In some areas, at the
discretion of regional and
local military commanders,
Chinese retailers are also to
be denied resident rights. This
climaxes a series of earlier
anti-Chinese measures, which
have included a head-tax,
severe restrictions on Chinese
social and educational bodies,
and in some areas outright
confiscations.
“Officially the ban applies
only to persons of Communist
Chinese citizenship and to the
group of supporters of Nation-
alist China who are classified
as Stateless. (Indonesia does
not recognise Nationalist
China.) But the issue of
citizenship is confused, and
many Chinese who are Indo-
nesian citizens lack documen-
tary evidence of the fact.
“The implementation of
earlier anti-Chinese regulations
suggests that, in certain areas
at least, the yardstick actually
used in the case of the present
ban will be race. Thus there
are grounds for fear that the
new regulations will in many
cases also be applied to persons
of Indonesian citizenship whose
residence in Indonesia may
extend to six or eight genera-
tions. In that event upward
of 200,000 people may be
affected.
“The future fate of these
persons is very much in doubt.
A small proportion can pre-
sumably be absorbed by
Chinese communities in Indo-
nesian cities. But trading and
manufacturing opportunities
there are severely limited, and
Chinese are barred from agri-
cultural pursuits.
“In recent months many
thousands of Chinese have left
Indonesia for Hong Kong and
mainland China. Indonesia’s
Foreign Minister Subandrio
has publicly discussed a pos-
sible repatriation of the
retailers to Communist China.
Needless to say, this is a
dreaded prospect for many, if
not most, of these persons.
Most of them have been born
in Indonesia and have never
seen China, much less Com-
munist China.

“It is encouraging to read
Dr. Subandrio’s assurance that
‘account will be taken of the
personal interests of the

human aspects of the problem,’
and a set of supplementary
regulations issued November
19 is evidence that his Cabinet
is concerned to prevent
excesses. But the cruelty of
the policy remains. And there
remains the further fact that,
whether because of sectional
'rterests, scapegoatist politics,
or whatever reason, groups
Hn the Indonesian Adminis-
jn are encouraging anti-
lese sentiment.”
_ondon “Economist” also
sees the Sino - Indonesian
quarrel as “different in kind
from the quarrel with India
or the earlier probing on the
Burma border”:
“On paper, the issue of
Indonesia’s 2,500,000 Chinese
was settled under a treaty
signed during the Bandoeng
conference by the Chinese and
Indonesian Foreign Ministers.
Nearly five years later the
treaty is still not in force ;
it has been ratified, but the
instruments of ratification have
never been exchanged.
“The treaty sounded sensible
at the time ; it required the
Chinese minority in Indonesia
to choose between Chinese and
Indonesian citizenship. But it
is never likely to mean much
so long as China continues to
regard all descendants of
Chinese abroad as Chinese
citizens for ever.
“When Dr. Subandrio. the
Indonesian Foreign Minister,
was in Peking some weeks ago,
his attempt to explain the ban
to Mr. Chou En-lai was rudely
received. Since then, the
Chinese Embassy in Djakarta
has been sending its officials
into the villages to incite
Chinese traders to resist the
ban and distributing leaflets in
the same vein. In retaliation,
Indonesia has banned all
travel outside Djakarta for
Chinese diplomats, except the
Ambassador.
“The Indonesians justify
their ban as being an attempt
to remove remnants of
colonialism, and Dr. Suban-
drio charges the Chinese
with ‘monopolistic-capitalistic’
speculation, hoarding and
smuggling. It may, however,
cause them more trouble than
it is worth. South Vietnam
has tackled a similar problem
more humanely by turning its
Chinese into Vietnamese
citizens.”
Futures
From a Bradford “Wool
Record” article about the
visit to Bradford of Clive Hall,
president of the lately formed
Louden “Daily Express.”
AND WHEN AT LAST THEY DO GET THERE.. .
Sydney Greasy Wool Futures
Exchange:
“Who can say how a greasy-
wool futures exchange in Aus-
tralia will affect the raw-
material market of that
country? Who at this juncture
can be that it will not
interfere with the established
auction-system by diverting
wool from its normal channels
and, in other ways, adversely
influencing the price-mechanism
of the present marketing-
system?
“For his part Mr. Hall is
confident that the Sydney
market will do no harm to the
wool-trade or the woolgrowers.
On the contrary, he believes
that the opportunity to hedge
in Sydney, and to iron-out
variations between wool and
tops, and between New York,
London, Sydney and the other
futures markets, will be of sub-
stantial benefit to the trade, in
that violent price-fluctuations
in the physical market should
be eliminated.
“In evidence he quoted the
1950-51 'boom and bust' period,
when futures cover was not
freely available in many
countries (the London market
was not formed until 1953),
and, in contrast, the period
around Easter, 1959, when
prices threatened to run amok
but were (in Mr. Hall's opinion)
checked and contained by
futures operations.
“In April this year, he said,
the volume of world transac-
tions in futures actually doubled
in about a month, and then
it fell back quickly almost to
normal, showing that the
‘sting’ had been taken out of
the price-movement.”
Birth-control
T>tRTH-coNTROL lately became
** a political question in the
U.S. when the Roman Catholic
bishops, in reply to a television
feature which called attention
to the Roman Catholic posi-
tion in regard to birth-control
as a way of solving the grow-
ing problem of world over-
population, made an official
statement that U.S. Catholics
“will not support any public
assistance, either at home or
abroad, to promote artificial
birth-prevention .... whether
through direct aid or by means
of international organisations.”
This statement was taken as
a warning to the U.S. Govern-
ment on aid to underdeveloped
countries. Commenting on it,
the New York “Herald
Tribune” notes that “because
of the diversity of non-
Catholic religious groups and
their forms of organisation,
there is no single non-Catholic
point of view on birth-control.
But a number of non-Catholic
clergymen and religious organ-
isations have taken issue with
the Catholics on the question.
“Thereupon numerous
national political figures,
Catholic and Protestant, were
asked for their comments. The
replies were interesting and
may have their effect upon the
political fortunes of various
individuals. But so far as
American foreign policy is con-
cerned the question and the
answers were academic.
“There has been no serious
move —nor in reason could
there be one—to discriminate
against any nation which
either does or does not have
a programme of population-
control. The United States has
not spent a penny of foreign-
aid funds to disseminate birth-
control information, nor has it
any plans to do so. It is diffi-
cult to see why any country
should turn to the United
States Government for assist-
ance in a matter of this kind,
and even more difficult to see
why this country should create
a crisis of conscience for mil-
lions of Americans by granting
such assistance.
“Such a stand has its in-
evitable corollary, of course.
The United States Govern-
ment (and this applies to State
and local governments as well)
should not place any obstacles
in the way of private agencies
solicited either by foreign
Governments or individuals
here or abroad to supply birth-
control information.

Dragnet Digest
London “Financial Times”:
“Nato is a military alliance.
But the countries in it are also
the highly industrialised coun-
tries of the West who in the
years to come will have to find
large sums in order to aid the
underdeveloped world. Military
security must be maintained,
but humanitarian considera-
tions quite apart —economic aid
for African and Asian countries
is just as essential for the peace
of the world as is the possession
by the West of adequate mili-
tary forces.
“Europe will have to provide
more in the field of aid as well
as a higher proportion of the
funds for defence. The West
as a whole must look on the
whole defence- and aid-
problem in much the same light
as Mr. Khrushchev is looking
at Russia’s needs. Sums which
can be saved through the
rationalisation of defence
forces and production can be
used to raise the standard of
living in Asia, Africa and
Latin-America.”
* * *
Manchester “G u a r d i a n”:
“One question should be put
by the European members of
the [Nato] alliance to them-
selves. Do they (including
Biitain) really want a major
deterrent force of their own,
apart from the Americans?
“The British have built theirs
up. The French have begun
the long and costly process.
Eventually the West Germans,
since they have always with
some justice claimed equality
of status, will want either to
share with the British and
French or to build-up their
own nuclear force.
“Certainly, if everyone is to
insist on having bombs, it will
be cheaper to have a shared
deterrent for all the allies on
this side of the Atlantic. It
will be politically preferable,
too. But what effect will it
have on the Americans?
“It is bound to loosen the
ties to Europe. The United
States is likely to take fewer
1 isks on our behalf when
Western Europe has a nuclear
force (or forces) of its own—
especially when those risks
must include possible bom-
bardment of American cities.
What is more, Western Europe
(or individual nations there)
will be in a position to start
the use of nuclear weapons in
war. The stronger, therefore,
will be the incentive to the
United States to make clear
that it does not necessarily
stand with us. Its own survival
will be at stake.”
* * *
London “Time and Tide’’:
“Russia has been dropping
heavy hints through inter-
mediaries to the effect that she
could help to settle the Algerian
war if France were to adopt
a more conciliatory attitude in
Europe. The astute Mr.
Khrushchev would be well
satisfied if he could arrive at
some understanding with
France which would bring
about a new alignment in
Europe. He would like to see
France and the Soviet Union
lined-up against West Ger-
many and the United States.
“These are some of the
avenues which the Russian
leader will explore during his
French sojourn. So far four
full days have been set aside
for private talks.
“No matter how tempting
any offer regarding Algeria
may be, the French President
is not likely to overlook Mr.
Khrushchev’s attitude in the
Sino-lndian dispute. He has
made it quite clear that he is
not his brother's keeper. Paris
is well aware that the Chinese
have in the last few months
been playing an ever-increasing
role among Algerian rebels, in
regard to both money and
ammunition. If Russia were
to promise peace, would
Peking adhere?”

[U.N.] General Assembly has
confirmed in the voting-record
what two years ago was merely
a nagging threat to the
Western allies and their 20
obedient servants in Latin
America: that whenever the
Asian States and the proliferat-
ing nations of Africa choose
to combine, their power to
affirm their own view of
things, or to contain the
pressures of the rest, is now
almost irresistible.
“By next September the
Asian-African concert will be
further strengthened with the
votes of the three new African
nations (French Togoland, the
French Cameroons, and
Somalia). But already, from
its beginning in September, this
Assembly has done pretty
much what the Asians and
Africans have wanted done,
and failed to do what they
postponed by abstentions or
defied with a negative vote.”


Chesterfield, 49th Street, New
York, and always remembers
that hotel because of the
honesty of the people run-
ning it.
He used to sleep with his
pants under his mattress, to
press them, and when he left
. New York and arrived in San
Francisco, he discovered he
had left a pair of his pants
er the mattress at the
esterfield. He wired the
hold from San Francisco, and
pants were sent to him by
piaiiC. The hotel also sent a
letter explaining that the pants
had been found by a maid.
Bob Mackie left San Fran-
cisco on the Sonoma, a ship
that was later taken off the
Australian run and put on the
Alaska run. It was wrecked
off the West Coast.
A rriving in Sydney, Mackie
got a job as picture-
editor for Smith’s Newspapers
with the “Daily Guardian.”
He was signed to a three-year
contract the day he arrived.
Eric Baume was news-editor
there. (Bob has his photo
among the others at the
Captain Cook Museum—“A
brilliant man, Baume,” says
Mackie.)
Lennie Lower and Cec Hartt
were working at Smith’s at the
time, but “I was Peck’s Bad
Boy because I wore spats
around the office,” said Bob.
Nine months later the “Daily
Guardian” sold-out to the
“Sun,” and Bob left for
London in the Moreton Bay.
He was artist-cirm-publicity-
man for Columbia Pictures in
Soho, London. Then he went
to the “Daily Express” in
Glasgow.
He accompanied Lord
Beaverbrook on his East Fife
by-election campaign. While
with Lord Beaverbrook he
lived at St. Andrew’s Golf
Club Hotel.
After the campaign Mackie
spent a further five years in
London. Whenever his annual
holidays fell due he tripped to
Europe (half of expenses of
journalists working in England
were paid by the employers if
they holidayed in Europe).
Bob saw Hitler come into
power ; he saw the curbing of
the individual and the rise of
dictatorship, and it influenced
him into writing a play, “They
Crucified Me Twice,” which
told of a world war, dictator-
ship, all bound-in with the life
of Christ.
The play became an obses-
sion with him, and to gain
insight into the characters of
men who work hard with the
hands Bob worked his way as
fireman in a ship to Australia.
The ship was the 700-ton
Monmorah, which was being
brought here for the Wallarah
Coal Co. As the ship was not
returning, only Australians and
New Zealanders were signed-
on as crew.
The ship had no radio and
did not sight land at any part
of the journey, which took
three months. First stop Aus-
tralia. She arrived at Sydney
Harbor with one ton of coal
and a gallon of water!
The Monmorah was well
known around the coast of
N.S.W. as a collier. Later she
was wrecked, and the remains
can still be seen from Bulii
Pass. Bob wrote a story on
it: “Sleep Well, Little Ship.”
Bob wrote his play and sent
it to the U.S.A. He received
a letter from a man named
Richter, who said that the
play was the most powerful he’d
read. He wanted Bob and his
wife to go to the U.S. as his
guests for three months while
the play was produced. Noth-
ing more was heard. War
broke-out soon afterwards, and
Bob still has heard nothing
about his play, but he is toy-
ing with the idea of rewriting
it and bringing it up to date.
After he arrived in Sydney
in the Monmorah Bob
became publicity-officer for
Radio 2CH. He also did
sketches for “Radio Pictorial.”
While there, a man named
Dahl, owner of 4AY, in Ayr
(Q.), offered Bob a contract
to work for him. Bob accepted.
He was manager-salesman
combined. In six weeks he sold
210 contracts. He did acts on
the air, taking several parts in
one-man plays. “The Voice of
the Canefields” became some-
thing of a legend in those
parts.
He left there, sold ads. in
Townsville, came back to
Sydney, and got a job as an
artist with Greater Union
Theatres, where he stayed for
a couple of years.
Then Otto Camphin bought-
out 4AY and offered Bob his
job back with the station. Bob
accepted, but was there only
“While y're Waitin' , get me ten-bob in pennies ."
a few months when War II
broke-out. Then 39, Bob
returned to Sydney and enlisted
in the A.I.F. He shone in map-
reading and field-sketching, but
he was barred from going
into the front-line. He was"
seconded to the Army Educa-
tion Department, where he
spent four years.
While with Army Education
he wrote and illustrated five
books— Camp Pie, Sgt. Stinker,
Doughboys and Diggers, Salute
the Brave, etc. They were pub-
lished by the N.S.W. Bookstall
Co. He caricatured 7000 men
in the Army, and he lectured
on psychology.
After his discharge he started
the “Shire Sentinel” at Caring-
bah, on Sydney’s Illawarra
Line, and specialised in local-
government news. He fought
the local-government body in
his paper, and he challenged
it from the platform. He never
missed a council-meeting j
over seven years. He sat-in oi
meetings of 136 organisation
in the same area’s Sutherlam
Shire.
He stood for the seat o
Barton as an Independen
against Doc. Evatt, but wa
beaten. In 1953 he stood a
an Independent for Werriw;
at the Federal elections. B
stood at the State election
for Flughes. He was beate:
each time. “I was pipped a
the post because people don
like independent thinkers. A\
they think about is part;
politics, and that has ruina
the country.”
With a cynical, philosophica
look in his eye, Mackie said
“The mob likes getting pushet
around. They can’t think fo;
themselves —a mob can’t think
“It is this being led by the
nose which allows people to
be ruled by dictators ; it allows
them to be struck by fear-
fear of atom-bombs, depres-
sions. Fear governs men, and
it is so wrong. Love should
govern life. ‘Faith, hope and
love, and the greatest of these
is love.’ This is the teaching
of Christ.
“There is too much intoler-
ance in the world; there is
too much fear ; there is too
much of the negative approach
to living.”
Co much time did Bob Mackie
devote to local-government)
with the object of shedding
light on maladministration,
that he undermined his health.
He developed ulcers and a
weak heart. He was given three
months to live.
So Bob Mackie packed-up
his newspaper and bought

opened his Captain Cook
Museum and collected material
from the four corners of the
earth—anywhere where there
were relics of Australian his-
tory. He published a book, in
pictures, of the history of the
Sutherland Shire. He wrote
letters to local newspapers, but,
for the rest, he let his jour-
nalism go, in the main. His
talents in this line he pin-
pointed with snappy quips on
cards, which he hung on the
walls of the museum —visitors
went to his museum specially
to see them, so they could have
a laugh.
In 1957 he went back to
journalism in a small way, with
another local paper, but it was
only a four-page job which
required little effort.

Bob, “but I’ll fool them. I’ll
live to a ripe old age. Why?
Because I diink beer, smoke

a bullocky! ” But the fatalistic
side of Bob Mackie took-over,
and he said, sombrely: “But
when your number’s up, it’s up,
brother!”
TTe is a queer mixture is Bob
Mackie. He is forthright,
sincere, a sticker for the under-
dog, a hater of dictatorship
and fear, a detester of intoler-
ance and interference, a family-
man with itchy feet, with a
great love of country and
freedom. And he is an indivi-
dualist to the extreme. Yet
he is modest.
“You know the finest words
I ever heard spoken?” Bob
asked. “Those words are in
‘Uncle Tom's Cabin,’ and I
remember seeing the play for
the first time many, many years
ago, at the London Pavilion.
“I’ll never forget that first

Tom, and he was sensational.

pointed out to the man.
So he said, “This will color

I liked the drink and took
little sips to make it last. After
a while the man said, “Here,
hurry up and drink that and
I’ll give you another ; you’re a
way behind the field.”
The lemonade was there, but
he couldn't find the vinegar,
and someone said, “It’s gone

So the man tipped some red

“This will color it.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Anzac Pilgrimage
When I first wrote about a
pilgrimage to Anzac (B.
21/10 / ’59) I said that my
purpose was to sow a seed in
the hope that either the R.S.L.
or some imaginative Federal
politician would take the
matter up and see what could
be done about it. Well, the
seed seems to have fallen on
fertile ground. The matter has
been vigorously taken up by
the old 28th Battalion Associa-
tion in W.A.
At the association’s last
meeting the article from The
Bulletin was read and dis-
cussed, and one of the mem-
bers (Harold J. Cope) was
given authority to proceed.
He certainly hasn't wasted any
time. Letters have been
written to the M.H.R. for
Perth asking him to put the
suggestion to the Prime
Minister, also to the State
President of the R.S.L., the
Minister for the Navy, the
Turkish Consul and the
Turkish Prime Minister.
Mr. Cope has also drawn
attention to the fact that our
Navy personnel is paid all the
year round, in or out of ser-
vice, and that if the Federal
Government would assign a
crew to one of those idle ships
1 earlier referred to, there
would be no increased cost
under that head. A very good
suggestion, I think. We have
the idle ships and we have the
crew, so the rest should be
easy.
The W.A. president of the
R.S.L. has been asked to bring
the matter of the pilgrimage
before the Federal president ot
the league, and I have an idea
that if the other officials move
as actively as Mr. Cope there
is some hope that something
might yet be achieved on the
lines suggested before next
Anzac Day. Branches of the
R.S.L. in the eastern States
might take a lead from what
is being done in the West. —

King’s Park, Perth
Please allow me, a former
member of the board of King’s
Park, Perth, to applaud
“Pieter Nuyts” and give
“Boatman’s Mate” the bird.
1 was glad to play a part in
resisting pressure from
suburban-minded vandals who
wanted to transform the park
into a central city-playground
“Boatman’s Mate’s” idea
that a couple of golf-courses,
more bowling - greens and
tennis-courts and playgrounds
for children would add greatly
to the appearance of the park
betrays a queer attitude. He
would, no doubt, like a re-
production of North Sydney’s
Luna Park also.
Anyone who looks ahead
will be appalled by this lack
of vision. One day there will
be bricks and mortar from
Midland Junction to - Fre-
mantle, with a population of
something like a million. Then
what will be left of the
thousand acres of King’s Park
in its natural state will be one
of the wonders of Australia:
virgin bush and wildflowers in
the heart of a capital-city.

According to newspaper
rennrts, author Nevii Shute

bom: e world-premiere of the
iade from his novel On
Beach because he dis-
• with director Stanley
Kramer’s interpretation of the
story.
One of the chief characters
in Ray Lawler’s play “The
Piccadilly Bushman” is an
Australian writer defending
his novel against attempts by
two English film-men to
change its Australian charac-
ter in their adaptation of it.
This has led certain commen-
tators to imply that Lawler, in
writing the play, was hitting
back indirectly at the film-
makers who, in adapting
“Summer of the 17th Doll,”
shifted certain emphases and
changed the ending.
The implication about
Lawler is probably false. The
film of “The Doll” strikes me
as a very conscientious effort
to get- the Australian charac-
ter, if not exactly the story,
right—a much more con-
scientious effort Holly-
wood usually makes to get
“foreign” characters right—
and the important departures
“ Let's dive down to HER just for the fun of it !”
from Lawler’s plot are at least
defensible artistically, as
“R. McC.’s” thought-provoking
review in B. 9/12/’59 demon-
strated.
This, however, is beside the
point. The question raised
by the above cases is whether
an author, having received a
huge sum for the film-rights
of a work, is justified in com-
plaining when film - makers
alter it for commercial or other
reasons (that they often make
changes for artistic reasons and
sometimes actually improve on
a book is seldom mentioned).
The movies have made
many a writer more famous
and financially secure than
his original work could ever
have done. Of course, they
do it for their own profit, and
they probably don’t care
tuppence for a writer's wel-
fare ; but, all sentiments of
benevolence and gratitude
aside, the enormous prices they
pay—often as much as £50,000
—must, on a strictly business
basis, buy a hell of a lot of
rights.
Also, no writer has by now
any excuse for failing to
realise before he sells his
rights that film-companies,
which must make profits on
their huge outlays, are more
likely than not to alter his
work in some way or other.
The spectacle of him crying
with anger and surprise over
the result all the way to the
bank can therefore hardly be
expected to elicit much public
sympathy.

M.L.A.s’ Salaries
Commander C. C. M. Usher
16/12/’59) is right: com-
pulsory voting should be
abolished. More and more
People are ignoring the law,
especially at municipal elec-
tions.
Also, people of all shades of
°Pinion are showing less
interest in joining political
parties, thereby leaving selec-
tion of candidates to very few
—probably even less than the
10 per cent, mentioned by
the Commander.
The reason? Many erstwhile
party-members feel that poli-
ticians are so well paid that
they should fight their own
campaigns for jobs and pen-
sions. 1 was secretary of a
party-branch for some years,
and can speak with assurance
on this.
After all, it is neither easy
nor altogether reasonable to
ask some battler to contribute
to party-funds and work to
.return a member to a good job
with lifetime security after a
certain period of tenure. And
the M.L.A. will often find some
flimsy excuse to stay away from
a sparsely attended branch-
meeting.
The Commander sums-up
correctly: these politicians are
only public servants with a
slight difference. C. B. M.
(N.S.W.).
The Last Frontier?
Australia still has her
frontier lands. Recently a
leading exporter of scrap-metal
concluded a deal with natives
in W.A.’s Nor'-west whereby
the exporter obtained the rights
for the supply of manganese,
which is abundant in the native
territory of this area.
In this year of grace 1959
where was this deal confirmed?
In no less a place than the
sacred corroboree-grounds im-
mediately following an initi-
ation ceremony at which—
fortunately for the firm’s
representative—all the natives
of the territory were repre-
sented.
In true storybook style—so it
is reported—the white man
first viewed the corroboree,
then, after this somewhat un-
usual preliminary to an indus-
trial deal, was allowed to put
his proposals to the assembled
elders, each group having its
own interpreter. After due
consideration the proposals
were put to the vote, and the
white man left with the deal
successfully concluded.
Credit for this success should
really go back to McLeod, the
man who some years ago
organised some of the Port
Headland natives into a co-
operative group. Although
McLeod has since left the
district the Pindan Co-opera-
tive Group remains now
wholly run by the natives them-
selves. It was undoubtedly this
group that took the leading
part in the negotiations and
presumably was able to per-
suade their less-civilised con-
temporaries to allow the white
man and his machines to enter
their territory.
The report doesn’t say
whether the firm’s representa-
tive had to become a tribal
blood-brother or not. The
possibility of this, however,

must introduce a new occupa-
tional hazard into the work of
the “scouts” who seek mineral
rights in the more remote
regions of our continent. It
would perhaps have been a
fitting climax to such a deal if
the document presumably
there must have been one —
was signed in blood.
But perhaps the Pindan
natives who are more used to
the white man’s industrial ways
scorn this primitive but
ntic method. Perhaps
even produced a ballpoint
i for the elders to record
the : i marks. — Western Ped

Siting the Capital
In “Memoirs of a Pioneer
Pressman” (B. 2/12/’59), S.
Baxter Cook revives some
interesting memories of the
early days of Canberra. But
his liking for Dalgety puts the
controversy about the siting of
the capital in a rather biased
form. (Has he ever lived at
Dalgety?)
An early candidate for the
capital was Ballarat (not
mentioned by Baxter Cook).
An enthusiastic Lord Mayor of
the city even had cress planted
in the Sturt Street gardens to
read “Ballarat, the Future
Federal Capital.” He then in-
vited Federal politicians to see
the city.
The story goes that George
Reid was so alarmed at its
suitability that he rushed off to
Sydney and organised opinion
to get it stipulated that the
capital must be in N.S.W.
Another supporter of Ballarat
was the famous E. W. Cole
(Book Arcade), who issued a
picture of an open hand with
all the State capitals marked,
to show that Ballarat was
centrally placed with regard to
them.
After many sites had been
voted-on, Dalgety was chosen.
But there was violent opposi-
tion by N.S.W. members. The
story I heard on arriving in
Canberra in 1912 was that a
party of members was organised
to inspect Dalgety in rather cold
weather. All returned to
Cooma frozen stiff, and Billy
Hughes declared he was
blankety-blanked if he’d ever
go to Dalgety. Never having
been there I can’t comment ;
but there is the coach-driver's
story about the man whose
boxer hat blew off, and the
wind was so strong and the
country so flat that he ran 10’
miles before catching it.
As for Baxter Cook’s com-
parison between Dalgety and
Canberra, Dalgety is definitely
in snow-country and subject to
violent winds. Canberra could
be likened reasonably to
Ballarat, except that Ballarat
has a better annual rainfall : it
can spread an inch of rain over
weeks of quiet drizzle, while
Canberra gets an inch in half-
an-hour, and it all goes into
the river without soaking in.
The low-temperature read-

OUTMODED SHOW TESTS
his extract from “The
, eview of the River Plate,”
jR ci s Aires, a commercial
oreeder, giving his impressions
on the practices at Palermo
Show (Argentina’s premier
cattle and sheep show), voices
doubts on the practical value
of show-ring tests generally :
Dr. M. Levin, a mem-
ber of the Scientific
Research Council of
Israel, has invented a
new shrink - resistant
process for wool which,
he claims is an improve-
ment over all previously
known anti-shrink pro-
cesses. Dr. Levin’s new
treatment is said to
create textiles which can
be safely dyed, and
retain the elasticity of
wool which, in addition,
possess an “abrasion-
proof” quality which
doubles the life of the
textile.
It is not only claimed,
but a known fact, that
lambs marked and tailed
by the Elastrator
method of castration
and tailing are less likely
to become victims of
fly-strike. The Elas-
trator Rubber Ring
method is safe, sure
and, above all, humane.
“The show is on. The stands
are packed. The crowds roar
as the President arrives, and
21 tons of live bovine lard,
packed in square frames,
poised on stubby limbs and
drawn-up in orderly tiers,
quiver in solemn approval.
One marvels, and recalls Joy
Nichols’s line as Helen of Troy:
‘Oh, dear, what is the point
of it all?’ To which Jimmy
Edwards echoed: ‘Well, old
girl, the Greeks had a word
for it, but I’m not giving it
here.’
“The perceptive observer
will note a certain touch of
Freemason mystique coupled
with a rare aestheticism in the
regular showman’s lore. A
beast whose supposed object
in life is the economical pro-
duction of beef must, in
common with the Parisian
mannequin, possess ‘style’ and
a ‘beautiful head.’ Some dis-
cerning critics will even
solemnly dispute on the pig-
mentation of his snout.
Animals shown at Palermo
represent the zenith of years
of selective breeding stretching
back to Coke of Norfolk and
other pioneers in the 18th
century. Traditions have taken
root over the years and are
solidly entrenched. The fact
that market-demands have
changed the targets for selec-
tion is all too often ignored
by conservative breeders and
dismissed with such slogans as
‘We must educate the ignorant
housewife.’
“However, by far the most
serious charge against the
influence of the- show-ring is
that an animal is there only
judged on one or two —and
those not the most important
—of the four basic hereditary
characteristics of fundamental
commercial importance that
cattle and sheep possess: (1)
fertility ; (2) mothering ability
—sufficient milk properly to
rear her calf or lamb; (3)
ability to produce as much
meat, milk or wool as econo-
mically as possible under the
particular conditions which
they are being bred to produce
under; (4) ability to produce
what is most favored by the
market—e.g., type and quality
of meat, milk or wool.
“It is quite possible for the
prize beef-bull to be: (1) the
son of a shy breeder, and
either sterile himself, or with
semen possessing a poor sper-
matozoa count; (2) out of a
dam with poor mothering
ability; (3) brought-up on a
nurse-cow under conditions
bearing no relation to those
under which his commercial
grandsons will produce ; (4) a
poor weight-gainer and an
inefficient fodder - converter
himself; (5) carrying more fat
than the current market
demands.
“It can be argued that it is
possible to judge an animal’s
weight-for-age in the ring.
While this is so to an inexact
extent, it is a fact that in recent
years show - judges have
favored smaller animals for
their fancy points, with the
result that some breeds have
probably actually lost size and
weight-gaining ability.
“It has been shown in Aus-
tralia that once a certain high
standard of wool-yield jff
head has been reached furtl ill
significant increases cannot ?
achieved by selection by p
alone, while they have beP 1
achieved by weighing indif 1 ;

are traded among the pedigree

it is dubious if the show-ring

Molasses-grass
\ “Mulga”: Experiments with
molasses-grass (Melinis minuti-
fiora) around Pomona (Q.)
have succeeded in choking-out
blady-grass, which is a pesti-
lent weed on cultivated ground,
particularly along the coastal
belt. Stock won’t touch blady-
grass except for a few weeks
after it has been burned-off,
and then it causes sickness
through tough grass-particles
collecting in the animals’
stomachs.
Molasses-grass, a native of
Brazil, was introduced into
Queensland about 30 years ago.
It grows to perfection in the
Far North, but succeeds along
the coast to within 50 miles of
the N.S.W. border. A creeping
Perennial and a rapid grower,
it roots at the stem-nodes,
smothering-out other plants
and forming a dense mat. This
grass is nutritious, does not
taint milk, and once cattle have
acquired a taste for it they eat
it greedily. A useful grazing
grass, it also makes excellent
hay. The foliage is soft and
rather hairy, like kikuyu ; the
faint scent of molasses it gives
°ff is reputed to repel ticks and
Mosquitoes.
The seed of molasses-grass
( ev en finer and lighter than
that of Rhodes-grass) should be
Mixed with damp sawdust at
the rate of lib. of seed to a
corn-sack of sawdust, to permit
even sowing. Lay alternative
layers of sawdust and seed on
a floor or tarpaulin, and blend
them thoroughly. Seeding is
done in the spring or early
summer, at the rate of 31b. an
acre, preferably after a “burn,”
with the seed broadcast as soon
as possible after the ashes are
cold. Ploughed land should be
worked to a fine tilth, and then
rolled to make a firm seedbed.
Broadcast the seed both ways
—north to south, then east
to west. This is important to
get even distribution. No
harrowing is needed after seed-
ing.
The seed ripens during June,
and is difficult to harvest with-
out special machinery. How-
ever, seed is procurable from
most Queensland agricultural
seedsmen.
Greenfeed for Poultry
“Pieter Nuyts”: Many
Westralian poultryfarmers have
sown around their homesteads
an area of lawn which will
yield a big part of the flock’s
greenfeed requirements; they
run over a part of it each day
with a power-mower fitted
with a catcher.
For the small man, or one
just starting, it's an easy,
inexpensive way of producing
rich-colored yolks.
It doesn’t work so well with
a big flock, because you need
at least a quarter-acre of good
feed to supply each 1000 birds.
This means, too, that every
1000 birds need a quarter-acre
under irrigation, which costs a
lot to provide and maintain.
It also usually means crops
which have to be cut with a
scythe and then put through
a cutter.
While this* work is going on
in hundreds of farms near the
city—l’m speaking of condi-
tions in W.A., but no doubt
these remarks apply equally
in other States —throughout
the suburbs dozens of mowers
are working full-time mowing
lawns. A man with a good
round will trim well over an
acre of lawn a day, and if
he does the job regularly the
trimmings would be just about
the right size for poultry. Each
mowing-contractor probably
cuts enough greenfeed each
day for 4000 or 5000 birds.
There should be some way
these two industries could get
together, or maybe someone
could take advantage of the
mower’s need to dispose of his
clippings and the farmer’s need
to supply greens to his flocks.
It would call for organising ;
the farmer would need to know
what greenstuff is worth a bag
to him, delivered and cut to
size, and the mowers could
estimate what the extra time
and trouble is worth to them.
I don’t say there’s a fortune
in it for anyone, but the sug-
gestion’s there for any farmer
who can contact a mower and
come to terms with him ; and
someone looking for an open-
ing might find a living here
and provide a service.
Pigs in Summer
“Windy”: Unless pigs have
plenty of shade and water, hot
weather can knock condition
off them.
If shelters are thatched or
covered with boughs make sure
there’s enough cover left after
the winter. Wind and rain
can strip some off, so that in
summer it’s too thin to keep
out the sun. A deep shade is
always a cool shade, and that’s
what pigs need most in hot
weather.
Also, water should be laid-
on in every pen or run. If
pigs have to walk long distances
to water they rapidly lose con-
dition. Flexible polythene hose
permits extension of the water-
supply without grpat trouble or
expense.
Summer is the time for
worms. They breed in warm,
moist conditions and thrive
around wallows and in boggy
drains. Keep wallows down
by cutting diversion-drains
across the run of the water.
Far rowing-pens, deep litters
and other enclosures become
very hot and stuffy unless they
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(24/12/’59)
Queensland should have good general rains during
January, with heaviest falls on the Peninsula and the coastal
and north-western districts. Flooding is likely in part of the
south-western and south-eastern districts and in the central
and northern divisions.
N.S.W. should have good general rains during January,
heaviest in the northern divisions. Flooding may occur in
part of the South-west Slopes and Southern Tablelands and
on the North Coast. A .period of patchy rainfall may follow,
with heavy rains and severe flooding in May.
Reasonably good rains should be experienced in
Victoria during January and February, although the Mallee
and Wimmera may have only light rain. A period of patchy
rainfall should follow, with good seasonal rains in May.
South Australia looks like having only light to moderate
patchy rains during January, although isolated heavier falls
may occur in the interior.
Good general rains should be received in Western Aus-
tralia during January, with heaviest falls on the north-west
coastal districts, where heavy rain may be associated with
a willy-willy.

can be opened to enable air
to circulate through them. Oil
all hinges on louvres, shutters
and doors, and make sure
latches and fasteners are in
good order, so that shutters
and doors won’t bang and slam
in heavy winds.
Feeding-troughs need special
attention in the summer. Hot
weather sours milk left in
troughs and breeds bacteria
which scour pigs, especially
sters, and often kill them,
if the animal recovers,
if > a long time to regain
con . i in. Clean all troughs
and v eding-vessels regularly,
fins is important all the year
round, but doubly so in the
summer.
Finally, don’t forget the pigs
themselves. Give them a good
worming-out if there are
worms about. Examine them
for lice and mange. These
troubles are easily cured;
neglected, they cut the pig-
cheque.
Equine Anaemia
“Wilga”: Can’t agree with
“Osdoc” (B. 25/11/ ’59) that
“equine infectious anaemia is
now raging in Queensland.”
The ailment that has affected
three properties (all close
together north-west of Rock-
hampton) has never been posi-
tively diagnosed as equine
infectious anaemia, although its
symptoms are somewhat
similar. The 40 horses “Osdoc”
mentions as dying amounted to
less than 10 per cent, of the
total held on the three pro-
perties, and their deaths oc-
curred over a period of 21-
years, so the disease can hardly
be said to be “raging.”
When the disease was first
noticed about July, 1957.
Department of Agriculture
officers placed quarantine-
measures on the areas and
established a buffer-belt around
the district as a precaution.
A conference of leading Aus-
tralian vets, approved these
control-measures and recom-
mended that a definite diag-
nosis should be obtained as
early as possible. Samples
were sent to a laboratory in
Italy, but no conclusive results
were obtained. At present the
Queensland Agricultural De-
partment’s director of
pathology is in Japan, making
an extensive study of equine
infectious anremia.
It is known that the Rock-
hampton disease is caused by
a virus from some unknown
source, but it’s too dangerous
to import virus from overseas
for comparative testing.
Generally, the disease does
not cause heavy losses amongst,
horses, and well-cared-for
animals are less susceptible to
infection than .those over-
worked and underfed. A
recent State-wide survey failed
to produce any evidence that
the disease had spread from
the original infested area.
Meanwhile a close watch is
“ —and now a folk-song I collected from the New York
savages— ‘Dig Mah Crazy Two-tone Shoes!'”
being kept in all parts of the
State, particularly in the
quarantined area near Rock-
hampton.
As a result of the outbreak,
the New Zealand Government
issued a regulation that all
horses racing in Queensland
must spend six months in a
“clean” southern State, while
N.S.W. prohibits entry of all
horses from north of the 25th
parallel.
Sale of Jerseys
The Jersey herd of Sam
Hordern at Retford Park,
Bowral (N.S.W.), is to be
offered for sale on Monday,
January 18, Sam Hordern hav-
ing decided to concentrate on
beef-cattle.
Retford Park has been the
source of many of the best
Jersey cattle in Australia, both
for show-ring and production.
The present herd includes many
high-producing cows with fine
classification-ratings.
Tracing back to the best of
the early importations, the herd
is rich in the blood of Leda
Snowdrop, four times cham-
pion at Sydney Royal Easter
Show.
Mainly because of shortage
of labor it has not been pos-
sible to exhibit at the Sydney
Royal in recent years, but
classification-results show the
high standard of type and
character maintained at Retford
Park.
Daughters of four success-
ful post-war imported sires—
Midlands Fairy Jester, Golden
Bread’s Knight, Forest Home
Royalty and Brampton Bread
Beacon are among the fop
stud-matrons in the herd.
Posts That Last
“M’Lou": Good fencing-
posts are increasingly difficult
to find in Victoria’s older
settled districts, so Wimmera
farmers are particularly in-
terested in the C.5.1.R.0.’s sug-
gested methods of treating posts
to prolong their life.
Hitherto, round sapling-
timber has not been used for
making posts because as much
as half the cross-section of
sapwood either rots off at
ground-level or is liable to be
eaten by termites.
But that vulnerable sapwood
is the basis of the C.5.1.R.0. s
preservative treatments, which
can make even 10-year-old
sapling-timber so strong that
it is good for 50 years. There
are various treatments, all aim-
ing at getting some preserva-
tive toxic to fungus and
termites—oil, creosote or salts
—into and through the sab
wood. This may be done wiE

.bob, so it seems the Wheat
ißoard would have to take less,
j Overproduction of eggs is
,the main cause of poultry-
lindustry worries. The only
brainwaves that have been
adopted by the industry, such
as chick-sexing, pellet-feeding
and laying-cages, have all
Resulted in greater egg-output,
but at lower profit. The time
‘may come when egg-production
will be confined to country
farms where the flock can do
a fair amount of foraging for
themselves.
The public doesn’t have to
patronise producer-agents if it
'doesn’t get a fair deal from
them. They should be reported
to the Egg Board, which will
take their permit from them.
Many producer-agents sell
only their larger eggs to the
public and consign the smaller
eggs to the board. I have never
heard of an egg-buyer com-
plaining of eggs being too big
or offering to pay double for
double-yokers.
Superphosphate
“C.8.M.”: I recall my father
discussing the early use of
superphosphate (B. 16/12/’59)
in South Australia. He lived
in the Adelaide Plains area,
which then seemed to have
outlived its usefulness for
wheatgrowing. Poor seasons
were blamed for the fall-off in
• yields, but the fact was that the
soil had been steadily robbed
of the necessary qualities for
production.
Use of artificial manures
was opposed on the grounds
that they would “burn the
heart out of the land.” But
there was another objection
taken by some of our puri-
tanical forefathers they
thought it morally wrong to
interfere with the ground in
this way! Eventually, they
said, people who did so would
ruin the earth altogether.
Tranquillising Animals
“Agricola”: Scrubber-cattle
a nd brumbies can be a real
Problem on hilly country. A
Wend of mine who owns a
65-square-rnile run estimates he
has £6OOO worth of cattle fit
for the market running in the
hills, but not the ghost of a
ohance of getting them out or
e ven yarding them in their
ru Bged terrain.
Help for men like this is on
the wa y An American
chemical-equipment company
has produced a rifle firing a
syringe fitted with a nicotine-
alkaloid which, when it enters
the skin, brings the beast to a
standstill. Injection of a tran-
quilliser can. then be given.
The drug is harmless. In an
experiment in America, a steer
was “tamed” seven times in
three months without any
harmful effects.
The duration of the drug’s
action varies with the tempera-
ment and condition of the
beast. Under station condi-
tions it has remained effective
for up to six days.
The invention was recently
tried on a property in the
Taroom (Q.) district, with most
successful results.
Broilers in Britain
- A notable change in
British eating-habits these last
few years is the increased
popularity of broiler-chickens,
once a luxury but now a
staple item of diet.
The demand for broilers
(“spring chickens”) grew from
30-million in 1957 to 75-million
in 1959 and is expected to
reach the 100-million mark
next year.
Selective breeding and the
application of mass-produc-
tion and scientific methods to
rearing and processing before
sale are the main factors re-
sponsible for the increases.
Selective breeding has pro-
duced a chick with a tender,
fleshy breast; nutritional
science has shown what diet
will most quickly produce the
fattest, tastiest and most tender
chicken. Result is that the
industry is now booming in
Britain.
White Wax-scale
“Myall”: White wax-scale
of citrus-trees is more common
in the humid warmth of coastal
districts than in drier inland
areas.
The young scales feed on
tender twigs and leaves, but
mature insects are usually
found on the smaller branches
and twigs. Only one genera-
tion is produced each year.
After batching, the young
insects move about the tender
shoots for a time before they
settle-down to feed. They then
develop a coating of wax,
which changes shape as they
mature. When fully developed
the insect is fin. long and
pure white, though it gradually
assumes a dirty greyish color.
If the infestation is light the
twigs and young branches
harboring the scale may be cut
away and burnt. For more
serious attacks a spray of soap
and washing-soda will produce
good results when applied from
mid-November to early De-
cember.
The spray is prepared from
51b. good laundry-soap, 141 b.
clean, fresh washing-soda and
75gals. water. The washing-
soda is dissolved in a small
quantity of water, which
should be brought to the boil,
and shredded soap added. Heat
the mixture until the soap is
dissolved, and add the rest of
the water. Keep the mixture
agitated during spraying. To
control pests and diseases of
citrus simultaneously, cuprous-
oxide mixtures may be com-
bined with this spray.
Farm Hints
“W.A.T.”: If you have
trouble growing parsley or
other herbs, prepare the seed-
bed with good loam, scald it
with boiling water, turn the
soil next day, and scald again.
Then cover the seed with sand
that has been scalded, to
prevent weed-growth or germs.
‘ Kune”: Dandelions, with
their high sugar-content, can
divert bees from helping in the
pollination of certain varieties
of fruit-trees. According to
Dr. Allan Waine, well-known
authority on bees, dandelion-*
blooms contain 50 per cent, of
sugar compared with only
about 20 per cent, in the nectar
of plum- and pear-blossoms,
so the bees are attracted
accordingly. Apple-blossom,
with 40 per cent., is far better
equipped to compete with the
sugary dandelion.
“J.J.A.”: In every litter there
is a runt which, left with its
mates, continues to get further
behind, and which, placed on
its own, seldom picks-up to
any significant degree. How-
ever, put in with a lot of slightly
smaller pigs—where it falls into
place as the biggest and bossiest
pig—it thrives. It’s a useful
lurk to prevent an otherwise
unthrifty pig from becoming a
liability.

If colonisation is not effected
within a certain time, does annexa-
tion lapse ?
Any discoverer of new territory
is deemed to have the right to
claim possession of it on behalf
of his country. Such a claim does
not give final ownership. It must
be renewed from time to time
by “showing the flag” or by
“effective occupation,” which is the
final test. Cook claimed possession
of the east coast of New Holland
in 1770. No ships, British or
foreign, touched the shores between
Cook’s visit and the arrival of
Phillip in January, 1788, a few
days ahead of La Perouse. If the
latter had arrived first it is pos-
sible that he could have “taken
possession” in the name of France,
but according to his own story
he had heard of the projected
settlement at Botany Bay and
arrived there expecting to find a
town already in existence. Instead
he found an empty bay, Phillip
having decided on Port Jackson as
the site of the settlement. In any
case, a claim of possession by La
Perouse would have been no more
than a claim. Phillip’s “effective
occupation” would have vitiated it.

(1) Amount of various minerals,
in pounds or ounces, in lOOgals. of
milk ? (2) In a beast of 7501b-
-9001b. live-weight ?
(From the Department of Agri-
culture, Sydney): (1) Mineral-
content of milk averages .75 per
cent., the limits falling between
.5 per cent, and .9 per cent. This
is termed the “ash constituents” of
milk. The following analysis
represents the average composition
of ash in the milk: potash, 25.42
“Quiet, you fool!"
per cent. soda, 10.94; lime,
21.45; magnesia, 2.54; ferric-oxide,
.11; sulphuric-anhydride, 4.11;
phosphoric - anhydride, 24.11;
chlorine, 14.60.
Minute quantities of zinc,
aluminium, phosphates, sulphates,
citrates, carbonates, iodine, silica
and fluorine are also present.
Amounts of the various minerals
in lOOgals. of milk can easily be
worked out from these figures,
(2) No figures covering an animal
of that weight. In a fat-beef steer
weighing 11101b. the total mineral
matter would be 2.76 per cent, of
total weight. The 2.76 per cent,
mineral matter is made up ot
calcium, 1.47 per cent.; phosphorus,
.79; potassium, .20; sodium, .16;
magnesium, .04; iron, .02; sulphur,

What are the powers and func-
tions of Justices of the Peace ?
The judicial powers of Justices
of the Peace are largely defined in
the statutes which create and regu-
late the jurisdiction of magistrates’
courts. Powers vary from State
to State, but in the main, subject
to some excluding provision, jus-
tices can adjudicate in court on
offences which are punishable
summarily; they can dismiss, or
commit for trial in a higher court,
cases which are indictable; and
they determine civil actions in
which the amount involved does
not exceed a given maximum.
Their ministerial functions include
issuing warrants for arrest; taking
affidavits and statutory declarations;
and witnessing the execution of
documents requiring attestation by
a special functionary, such as
instruments dealing with land under
the Torrens system. Some Justices
of the Peace exercise an extra-
territorial faculty by acquiring a
commission of the peace for States
other than the one they live in.
The rolls of Justices of the Peace
are controlled by State Govern-
ment departments, usually the
Premier’s or the Attorney-General's
Department.

COCKNEY SONGS
■Crom the Folk Music Record
-*■ Club, Sydney, comes Cock-
ney Music Hall Songs and Reci-
tations, performed by Colyn
Davies. Such a title might
easily lead people to think that
the songs and recitations are
stridently Cockney, and it
would be a pity if unwarranted
prejudice turned away would-
be buyers, for this record is
delightful.
Naturally enough, the Cock-
ney element pervades all the
subject-matter, but there, to a
large extent, it ends. Apart
from certain inflexions and
what might be called delicacies
of utterance the whole recital
strikes this reviewer as a
pleasant excursion into the
Cockney world.
Davies introduces you to
this world in a fresh manner.
The first noticeable point is
the absence of subsidiary
support. He accompanies him-
self, it is true, on a guitar;
but “accompaniment” is
capable of many definitions,
and in Davies’s hands the
§uitar merely gives him a
jangling starting-point and
helps to refresh his sense of
Pitch at odd moments through-
out the songs.
It seems to this reviewer,
having had some experience of
choral training, that the final
test of a singer is whether you
can understand what he’s sing-
ing about. Here Davies un-
doubtedly scores top marks:
his enunciation could hardly
be clearer. The jacket assures
us that he spent quite a time
at the British Museum “mulling
over their vast collection of
ballads.” Although not an
authority on such matters, one
would be inclined to say he
has absorbed much of the
grammatical peculiarity of the
Cockney—even if he never goes
as far as Stanley Holloway.
But, then, Holloway sang for
laughs ; Davies is trying to re-
introduce authentic presenta-
tion of music-hall songs.
In the first number you can
learn about the injustice of
“Moving Father’s Grave” to
make way for a sewer:
Father in his life was never a quitter,
And l don’t suppose he’ll be a
quitter now;
’Cos when the job’s complete
He’ll haunt that sewer sweet....
ending with the sentiment that
people shouldn’t muck-about
with a British workman's grave.
If you have a strong stomach
the next number, a recitation
called “The Cruel Game-
keeper,” can be listened to :
if not, not . . . what with a
woman being ripped-up and
her unborn baby “crawling in
her arms” ; but the next one,
a song called “The Poor Young
Man,” is really funny. The
young man coming to the city
to get a job falls into the
clutches of some college-men,
who get him drunk ; the un-
fortunate chap, having pre-
viously promised his mother
never to touch drink, lurches
out of the bar and meets a
“Salvation Army lassie.” In
a fit of rage he bursts her
tamborine, and she, uttering
some sort of gentle benediction,
. . . made a mark upon his brow,
With a kick that she had learned
before she was saved.
It ends in the familiar didactic
strain: don’t touch drink, and
“don’t go round bursting
ladies’ tamborines.”
“The Captain’s Apprentice”
is a pure sea-chanty, telling
how the captain knocks the boy
around, finally bashing him
with a marlin-spike “because I
didn’t like to hear the poor
boy cry.”
“The Wind Was Weirdly
Howling” is a recitation: high-
spirited nonsense, everything
disconnected and surreal —a
sort of liberal extension of
Lewis Carroll. Not sur-
prisingly it ends with an in-
junction not to spend all the
week’s wages on beer. The
rolling “Hog’s-eye Man” is
another chanty, an example of
a type of song which infiltrated
the English music-hall through
visiting seamen.
Last on this side is the old
“Villikins And His Dinah,”
that tragic favorite full of
“ge’ardens” and “cups of
cold pi’son.” Here the growl
before the “Too-roo-loo”
refrain is oddly disconcerting,
possibly because it contrasts so
strongly with the guitar.
The second side opens with
the quick-tempo brusqueness
of “Botany Bay” a ballad
touching on the transportation
of a criminal to Australia.
Such a theme must have been
enormously popular in the
music-halls during the early
19th century.
The melody in “The Poor
Young Girl” is identical to the
tune in “The Poor Young
Man.” The girl goes to the city
to seek employment, leaving
home for the singularly
illogical reason that her father
had fallen down and hurt his
knee —but the wolf was at the
door as well. She had to
promise her lover that every
night at eight she would burst
into tears to prove her fidelity.
After the recitation “Georgie
Barnville,” in which the young
shopman visits a wicked
woman, Davies gives out with
the old one about the pig and
the drunk, following with
“Blow the Candle Out,” one
of the most appealing songs
on the record. To a lilting
tune and refrain you learn of
the apprentice visiting his girl;
nine months and a day later
he writes to say that he’ll never
return to “blow the candle
out”:
If it be a male child, -you call it
after me,
And if it be a female, you dance
it on your knee.
This time the warning is
directed to young ladles:
The record'is available only
to members of the Folk Music
Record Club, 131 Cathedral
Street, Sydney.

SYDNEY
All the looking-back-over-the-past and
“1 mind the time . . .” talk that normally
takes place at the end of the old year
a nd the birth of the new has been inten-
sified this year tenfold because we have
come to the end of a decade, which is
generally regarded (though why, it is
hard to say) as a significant period of
time.
Generally, people seem to have found
the 1950’s satisfactory, mainly because
they were such an improvement on the
1940'5. The benefits of an earlier era
than that are fast vanishing into oblivion.
For instance, the 1950’s gave us the
supermarkets and the shopping-trollies,
which have made things easier for the
housewife than the ill-stocked corner-
shop and the string-bag.
But we seem to have forgotten that
before the 1940’s the housewife was the
patron of the shops; now she is the
petitioner. Then the tradesmen called
for orders and delivered the goods, pre-
sented baskets of fruit for inspection,
were upset if the customer wasn’t pleased
with what was supplied, and gave her
children bags of lollies when the bill
was paid.
☆ ☆ ☆
It was suggested in a morning paper
recently that we should all give the milk-
man a C'hristmas-present, just as we give
one to the garbage-man. Perhaps it is
a good idea. Then they might not go
on strike. But don’t forget that before
the 1940’s the milkmen used to give us
presents. A bottle of cream and a
Christmas-card were standard, and the
dairyman thanked us for our custom.
☆ . ☆ ☆
Pursuing this rather Scrooge-like line
of thought, consider the washing-
machines (known before the 1950’5, but
not so popularly used), the detergents,
the drip-dry clothes. All are blessings,
but if you have a washing-machine, how
can you cook your ham at Christmas?
And when you wanted to dye your cur-
tains, didn’t you regret the old copper?
☆ ☆ ☆
Detergents are fine, of course, but
most people keep soap around, too, just
as they did in the past ; and, as to drip-
dry clothes, useful as they are, they do
tend to clutter the bathroom, where
there always seems to be something
dripping and drying.
☆ ☆ ☆
We now have espresso coffee-bars (cup
°f coffee and a salad sandwich, 3s. 9d.).
Can you get a nice cup of tea? No!
We have all sorts of restaurants —Hun-
garian, Japanese, Chinese, Italian,
Danish, French, Indian. It makes
Sydney seem so much more civilised.
But how many of them serve a decent
s °rt of a meal for about 7s. 6d., which is
all one can afford? Precious few!
☆ ☆ ☆
Satellites were shot into space during
the 1950’5, and some people now know
what the back of the moon looks like.
This was all amazing, stimulating,
staggering. But somehow the face of
the moon which all of us know so well
doesn’t look quite so wonderful now.
This charming lady is Sydney’s dis-
tinguished citizen Mrs. Florence Taylor,
O.B.E., who celebrated her 80th birthday
during the week. The photo was taken
about the time when she was one of the
two women-members of the Advisory
Committee for Australia’s Sesquicen-
tenary Celebrations, and when she repre-
sented Australia at the Royal Institute of
British Architects Congress in London
with Sir John Sulman and Colonel
Alfred Spain. On her 80th birthday she
looked equally beautiful in her graceful
feminine way as she received congratula-
tions at her office-desk, where she has
worked regular 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours
for the past 60 years, and from which
she edits three technical magazines deal-
ing with engineering, building and
construction.
Television was a major innovation of
the 1950’5. It has done a tremendous
amount of good, keeping lonely people
happy, giving harassed mothers spells
of quiet and calm, introducing world-
famous personalities to the most unpre-
tentious suburban home, entertaining,
educating and providing all sorts of
subjects for discussion in groups where
conversation was formerly dying from
malnutrition.
☆ ☆ ☆
But, as this Letter seems to be on a
fault-finding mission today, it must be
mentioned that TV has much to answer
for in that it has introduced scenes of
unmitigated violence into the quietest,
most orderly homes. There is a great
vogue for westerns and crime-stories,
where the person who is quickest on the
trigger, smartest to bash his enemies, is
the “goodie.”
An American sociologist, Dr. Paul
Witty, recently stated that youngsters
who watched the wrong shows could
“gradually come to accept violence, hate
and destruction as almost normal ways
of life.”
This is a grave danger, especially as it
is not only irresponsible people who “just
love westerns”—Tut also poets, professors
and high-minded middle-aged ladies.
They seem to be blind to the implications
of such daily instruction in the home.
*, ☆ ☆
Sydney has changed during the decade.
There is building going on everywhere,
and it is going to be impressive when it
is finished. In the meantime it is all
scaffoldings and hoardings and excava-
tions and concrete-mixers and drills.
☆ ☆ ☆
The 1950’s brought us brighter clothes
for the men. The bodgies (also a gift
of the time) went to extremes, even
wearing lame coats and pink trousers.
But the mustard waistcoat is acceptable
everywhere, and embroidered, pleated
and tucked Swiss-cotton shirts are worn
without a by-your-leave by the smart set.
☆ ☆ ☆
Early in the 1950’s women’s fashions
bogged-down into a morass of little
grey suits and little white hats, but later
on the “sack” started a lively revival of
1920 styles, and fashion is very, very
alert at the moment. The short evening-
dress is winning over all others, and for
casual wear the leotard-and-ballet-shoe
type of dress is most popular and
engaging.
☆ ☆ ☆
In social life the Old School Dance
seems to be declining somewhat in
popularity. Decreased numbers are
reported from nearly all committees,
“And if it weren’t for the debs,” they
add, “I don’t know what we’d do.” It
looks as though some new form of enter-
tainment will have to be dreamed-up to
replace or reinvigorate these affairs.
☆ ☆ *
As for sports, there doesn’t seem to
be anything in the 1950's to surpass the
increase in the vogue for bowls, especially
women’s bowls, and it was very nice
to see that in the New Year’s Honors
list an M.B.E. was awarded to Naomi
Wolinski, president of the N.S.W.
Women’s Bowling Association, 1933-58.
☆ ☆ ☆
Which recalls us to the fact that it
is the New Year and that the prospect
ahead really looks bright. So have a
happy new year, whether it is prosperous
or not, and don't take too much notice
of crossgrained writers who find fault
witih everything. They are probably
soured by the thought that they are 10
years older than they were in 1950!

If he had run to decent length in his

seller in them, in the class of “The
Young Visiters.” But—“ June 5. We
ducked Stinker Brown in the horse
trough in Aro Street” —we must be
grateful for what we have of him. And,
charming though the diary-entries are
in themselves, it must be admitted that
such mysterious utterances as “July 2.

the opium” really do need the com-
mentary explaining that Haining Street
was in Wellington’s Chinatown.
CLOWNS AND ACROBATS
The faces laugh at clowns who fall and
run
Chaotically across the circus ring
And tumble with their smiles like lunatics
Who can’t escape their smiles, their hats
and rags.
But laughing stops —the proper act
appears
To hold this crowd until it's wire-tense.
Three acrobats march in, with birds and
dogs,
To walk the serious air and high trapeze.
The audience forgets the clowns who
leave
So thoughts may climb, back to a poise
above
The circus ring. High up beyond the
fools,
Where life is sane and delicate, they walk
And sway securely with the acrobats
Who must not fall and so become the
clowns.

Australopithecus
It may perhaps be taken as a com-
pliment to this country that the lowest
and most brutal of human types is
known as Australopithecus; but it can-
not, alas, be claimed that this delight-
ful term is used for present-day
Australians or even has any connec-
tion, except the most remote and
indirect, with our aborigines. Austra-
lopithecus is the beastly little ape-man,
sub-man or near-man whom they dig
up in caves in southern Africa, and the
term (which indeed could be used more
widely) means “southern apes.”
The nearest Australopithecus comes
to our own shores, so J. Desmond
Clark reminds us in The Pre-History
of Southern Africa (Penguins), is that
he is thought possibly to have evolved
into Pithecanthropus, the ape-man of
Java, who in turn is thought possibly
to have evolved into Homo Sapiens;
and that “the Pithecanthropic stock
early evolved, probably in Africa,
directly into a basic type of Homo
Sapiens, which, it has been suggested,
might be loosely described as ‘proto-
Australoid’ (i.e., having features in
common with the Australian
aborigine). This form probably be-
came rapidly dispersed and underwent
regional differentiation.”
Faint though the connection is, it
does give us a direct interest in Pro-
fessor Clark’s researches; and Australo-
pithecus is, in any case, very interest-
ing, if elusive, on his own account. He
was first discovered in a limeworks
quarry, where he appears to have been
working overtime, as recently as 1924,
and more of his family were found in
1936. He was 4ft. 6in. high, walked
upright and did not have the bony
ridges over the eye-sockets that
characterise the apes.
Opinions vary as to whether or not
he made and used tools, which is taken
to be one of the distinguishing attri-
butes of man. He is generally found
in his caves among piles of animal
bones, which suggests that he ate meat
and, since his teeth were not large, must
have used tools or weapons to slay the
animals; but there is a nasty sugges-
tion that he himself was food for beasts
of prey and was dragged into the caves
to be eaten. Fossilised skulls of a
small extinct baboon found in the
caves have openings at the top and base
indicating that he may have bej
partial to a dish of baboon’s brai|
but then very few tools with which!
could have made the incisions
been found. A few broken flints a|
one pointed bone instrument whii
might settle this problem are thou§
by some anthropologists to have be
made by another, later species of sa
man, Telanthropus.
Thus, until the rest of South Afri|
is dug up, Australopithecus remain
pretty much in the dark; and just]
well. Professor Clark is
this and in some other chapters |
cave-art, but on the whole the boolp
laborious. The long, dull introduce
chapters on “The Land and tl
People” and “Building Up the Sto|
should have been condensed into a fl
paragraphs.

Whitehead corrects the geographical
Mistakes about the river Thames which

Account of the life of Arthwyr or

After nearly twenty centuries Caradoc

while ago almost as if he still lives.
Serving among South Welshmen, I
ijame to hear much about him. for
hey counted him greater than any —
even Harry Tudor —they’d fought
tinder since, and their sweetest praise
was “brave as Caradoc.” My Silurian
infantry never forgot that their pedigree
came direct from those of whom
Tacitus wrote: —
To their natural ferocity, that
people added the courage they
derived from the presence of
Caractacus... .who, having drawn to
his standard all those who considered
peace with Rome another name for
slavery, determined to try the issue
of battle.
So from John Whitehead’s book
Arthur comes to life—no longer a
ghostly king flitting through a dream-
land-country, but the great Caradoc,
manoeuvring over the south of England
and fighting as a soldier would by the
age-old rules of war. Now. instead
of being Arthur who went to Rome
as a conqueror, he is Caractacus, sold
by a woman’s treachery and taken to
Rome in chains —though there he be-
came the conqueror of his captors,
because of his noble courage—but
coming back in triumph to his corona-
tion at Winchester and rejoining his
Round Table at Stonehenge. The
allegories of druidic metaphor are now
®ade clear; the link between druidism
a ad Christianity shows the true mean-
lng of Excalibur, the Hard Cleaver
(Calebwlch), “sword of the spirit”; and
Guenevere’s memory is unsullied —the
so-called queen Lancelot craved and
Mordred won was the crown of Britain.

Cricket Books
According to A. A. Thomson in
Hirst and Rhodes (Epworth) nobody
knows the name of the world’s greatest
all-round cricketer; all one can say is
that “he batted right-hand and bowled
left, and he came from Kirkheaton.
This description, of course, fits the
two old Yorkshire and Test cricketers
named in the title, both here admirably
written-up by a writer with a special
fondness for Yorkshire cricketers
(incidentally, he’s one of the best
writers on the game). Rhodes, now
82 and blind, had a remarkable
cricketing career, and must rank with
the all-time greats; and Hirst was an
exceptional county - cricketer he
didn’t do so greatly in Tests.
But whether either is the “world’s
greatest” can be doubted. There are
other equally great all-rounders. To
name but a few, Australians M. A.
Noble, Keith Miller, Jack Gregory,
West Indian Constantine (recently
revisiting Australia for the Parlia-
mentary conference) and Indian Vinoo
Mankad.
The Fight for the Ashes 1958-1959,
by lan Peebles (Angus and Robertson),
is a rather lifeless recapitulation of
the last Test series in Australia, useful
only for record purposes.
The writer, a former English Test
slow-bowler whose claim to fame is
that he dismissed Bradman for 14 in
the fourth cricket Test in 1930 in be-
tween scores by S’ Donald of 334 and
232, essays to be fair and impartial,
while obviously making as many
excuses as possible for the losing
Englishmen. He has to admit finally,
“The better side won.”

AN ODE FROM HORACE
Book I Ode 5
“Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa”
What scented stripling do you walk with
now ?
And in the dell, among the roses fair,
Whose arms enfold you, Pyrrha : and
for whom
Bind you your yellow hair
With simple grace ? He will, alas, too
soon
Bewail your broken troth, and heaven’s
caprice
That sent him, all unknowing, to
embark
On such unfriendly seas.
Now in his eyes you still are purest gold,
And in his dreams you walk faithful
and kind.
The seas are calm, the heavens un-
clouded still,
And gently blows the wind.
Unhappy men who know not yet your
worth.
But I, engulfed, against uncounted odds
Survived the storm, and treading the
dry earth
Have hung my seawet garments to
the gods.
a.c.t.

Australia and the South Seas: Bend
Lohse (Oliver and Boyd). Australia
inspected from the migration view-

amiable, covers the usual sights, and
says the usual things. “Culture” is
dealt with in half a page, in which the
author notes our enthusiasm for music,
says poetry is “amazingly popular,”
but records with regret that “An amaz-

money), gathering herbs for their
salads, hearing of strange herbal
remedies for blindness, searching for
antiquities washed-up on the shores
after storms. It is a book with a
curious and distinctive flavor; very

charming.
