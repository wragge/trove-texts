As a child, Whistler was taken to Russia. The
Czar Nicholas treated his father as a personal friend, and
the boy played with Russian princes and princesses in
the Court nursery at Petersburg. For education he was
sent back to America. West Point Academy had trained
Whistler’s father, his uncle, his elder half-brother, and
his maternal grandfather ; and to West Point Whistler
went inevitably in 1851, in his seventeenth year. He
remained nearly four years, but failed to graduate, and
at last was “discharged” as hopeless. A fellow-pupil
says that “his intellect was brilliant and his ability
unquestioned, but he was unable to fix his mind on
mathematical'studies, and all he cared for was to draw
and paint.” in his fourth year his draftsmanship
attracted general attention, and the instructor in
drawing was inconsolable when he left.
to work at random, and one of his favourite tricks
was to draw first, say the face, from the model, then a
foot, then the body, skipping from one part of the
picture to another, apparently without keeping any
relation of the parts. But,, when . the picture was
completed, all the parts seemed to fit in together

like a mosaic.- On one occasion Whistler was painting in'
water-colours from a picture representing the interior of
a cathedral, with monks and nuns scattered about
Behind the tonsured head of one of the monks Whistler
had painted a shadow : the assistant-instructor, making
his round of examination, paused at Whistler’s seat and
said, very audibly, “ Your work, sir, is faulty in principle.
What is the meaning of that shadow ? There is none in
the model, and by no principle of light and shade could
any shadow be there.” Without saying a word, Whistler
tilled his brush, with one sweep of it he threw a cowl
over the head of the monk. He had painted the shadow
first. The instructor walked quietly away.
straw that broke down the patience of the
West Point authorities was an appalling chemistry paper.
Asked in later years about this, Whistler said he left
West Point through the fault of Nature. “She persisted
that silicon was not a gas.” But Whistler’s mathematics
were worse than his chemistry, and his horsemanship was
of al *' At cavalry drill it was not unusual for
Whistler, when the troop halted, te go over his horse’s
head. Then the instructor would call out, “ Er—Mr.
Whistler—are n’t you a little ahead of the squad ? ” One
day, a very bad fall somewhat alarmed the major in com-
mand, who called, “Mr. Whistler, are you hurt?” To
which Whistler, rising, drawing off his gauntlet, and
brushing away the tan, responded : “No, Major; lam
only wondering how any man con keep a horse for
pleasure l”
£
Whistler’s shortcoming caused his family anxiety,
and the next year a place was found for him in
the drawing division of the U.S. Coast Survey at
Washington. There his first etchings were executed for
Government plans. A fellow-employee describes him at
this period as “an elegant figure of a young man, with
an abundance of black, curly hair, soft and lustrous
eyes, finely-cut features, fair complexion, well-shaped
hands, and a graceful tournure. Handsome ; but
his mouth betokened more ease than firmness, his
brow more reverie than mental activity, and his
e\es more depth than penetration. Sensitiveness
and animation appeared to be his predominating
lra i t u’” As an °® o ' a *' h e was hopelessly unpunctual,
and he spent in fancy sketching the time he was expected
to employ in departmental work. So, after a short
period, his services were dispensed with. Then his
father gave him his own way, and he went to Paris, and
entered O. G. Gleyre’s studio as a pupil of painting.
While in Washington, the Russian Minister, a friend of
his father’s, showed him great hospitality ; and Whistler
responded with an invitation to dinner. He called at
the Minister’s house with a carriage; the Minister
entered, and was driven to a store, where Whistler
courteously asked permission to alight, and re-
turned with a paper parcel. Then they drove
along to other shops, and the procedure was
repeated. Finally they came to Whistler’s lodgings,
where he gave the Minister a comfortable chair, opened
his parcels, and cooked a dinner of several courses oyer a
gas stove, serving it himself with appropriate wines, and
following it with coffee and cigars. He talked the whole
time, explaining to the Minister that he had not the
money to tender the entertainment he wished to <dve
And this was the next best thing*. At the conclusion, the
guest was sent formally home in a carriage

I n Paris Whistler lived upon an allowance
from his father. The money came promptly every month,
and was'promptly spent. In the last week of the month
he would be withopt a sou, living- on the remnants of his
studio supplies. These were generally exhausted a few
days before the arrival of the new remittance, and then
would Whistler lie on the door and rave at fate, some
times praying for death, but never borrowing a’ franc
Month after mouth this went ph.
After two years in Paris Whistler went to Italy, and
spent some time in Venice. He was always improvident
and always hard-up. There is a story that at one time
he and his model were in such straits that thev resolved
to drown themselves together in a canal. They left their
rooms in order, and started out. Luckily it was evening
and an especially brilliant sunset distracted Whistleris
attention. He sent the model bark for a canvas and his
colours, and painted the sunset. The sketch was sold the
same evening ; and they forgot all about suicide
111 1863 Whistler came to London, where his home was
fixed untU his return to Paris in 1895. He had- a house
at Chelsea, close to the Thames ; and there his remark-
abie etchings of river scenery were made. In 1888 he
married the widow of E. W. Goodwin, architect and
writer. The lady was a daughter of J. B. Philip, an Eng
sculptor of some celebrity in the last century 8 ‘

The first of Whistler’s three books—high-flown
often witty, and on the whole rather thin and
•rtiflciaj-was The Gentle Art of Making Enemies,
' nspuert by the famous quarrel with Ruskin
Whistlers nocturnes and symphonies were too much for
the nerves of the veteran critic, who wrote in Fors Clavi-
ffera in 1877; “I have heard and se/n much
of Cockney impudence before mow; but never
expected to hear a coxcomb -ask two hundred
guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public’s face ”

that Whistler s Symphony in White” was not a sym-
phony in white, because there was yellow in the girl’s
hair and flesh tints in her cheeks, ‘Whistler retorted ■
Bon Dieu ! Did this wise person expect white hair and a
chalked face? And does he then, in his astounding con-
sequence, believe that a symphony in F contains no other
note, hut shall be a continued repetition of F, F, F?”
J*
In 1888 Whistler announced anew the artist’s
privilege in Ten O’Oloclc, a skittish little book published
a *v®“Listen ! he said, “.There never was an
artistic period. There never was an art loving nation.”
True , Art arose ; Art grew ; Art lived and spread and
• reigned supreme—by force of fact, not by election, and
there was no meddling from the outsider. ..
“And centuries passed in this using, and the world was
flooded with all that was beautiful, until there arose a
new class, who discovered the cheap, and foresaw fortune
m the future of the sham.
“Then sprang into existence the tawdry, the common
the gewgaw.
“The taste of the tradesman supplanted the science of
the artist, and what was born of the million went hack to
them, and ehartped them, for it was after their own
heart ; and the great and the small, the statesman and
the slave, took to themselves the abomination that was
tendered, and preferred it-and have lived with it ever
since !
“ An d the artist’s occupation was gone, and the manu-
facturer and the huckster took his place...
“ And the people—this time—had much to say in the
matter—and all were satisfied. And Birmingham and
Manchester arose in their might—and Art was relegated
to the curiosity shop.”
J*
Ten years later Whistler’s encounter in the
French law courts with Sir William Eden moved him to
write the story of The Baronet and the Butterfly— with
the motto “ Noblesse Abuse “ Being a rare and fas-
cinating history, wherein is shown, with much wit and

From the lithograph by Whistler.
circumstance, how the gentle Master, unsuspecting, was
sighted, tracked, waylaid, circumvented, and run to eari h
by a commercial knight of untiring industry,”—and
much more to similar effect.
By, this time Whistler’s wit was wearing thin ; and his
pose had grown familiar. The book had a success of
curiosity only. Yet, when he gave evidence in the Pennell-
Sickert libel case in 1897, he seemed to have retained
something of his old capacity for repartee. The case
turned on a distinction between direct and transfer
lithographs. Whistler declined to admit the distinction.
“Whatever the artist touches produces whatever effect
the quality of the medium affords.”
“ Do you know," Whistler was asked, «that the Royal
Academy does not accept transfer lithographs?” “I
hear this with surprise,” he answered. “ But 1 am not
at all aufait with the limitations of the Royal Academy,”
“ Mr. Sickert wrote,” continued counsel, “ that Mr.
Whistler’s almost nothings are priceless. You-don’t dis-
sent from that?” “It is very simple and very proper,”
-replied Whistler, with calmness, “that Mr. Sickert
should say that sort of thing ; but I attach no importance
to it.”
At the close of the trial Whistler begged to be allowed
to deliver a speech which he had prepared for a British
jury. Unluckily, the Judge refused permission.
J*
One of the best and best-known of Whistler’s
pictures is the portrait of his mother, “an arrangement
in gray and black,” hanging in the Luxembourg
gallery at Paris. The composition of this picture, painted
in 1872, was in Whistler’s mind ten years before, when he
was drawing illustrations cut on wood by Dalziel for Good
Words. In the portrait of Carlyle he held to the same
idea. Other pictures highly valued are The White Girl
(1862); Princesse des Pays de Porcelaine (1865) ; the Noc-
turnes in blue and gold, and blue and green (1878); the
“arrangement in black” of Lady Archibald Camp-
bell; the “arrangement in gray and green” of Miss
Alexander ; and the Sarasate.
Whistler’s art was undoubtedly influenced by the near-
sightedness from which he suffered all his life. In using
pencil, ink, or water-colour, he drew with his eyes
scarcely a hand-breadth from the paper. For the rest,
as George Moore has pointed out in what is possibly the
truest criticism of Whistler that has been printed
( Modern Painting), he was the victim of his physical
constitution. He had the brain to conceive great things,
but force failed him to create them. “The greatest
- painters, I mean' the very greatest—Michael Angelo,
Velasquez, and Rubens—were gifted by Nature with as
full a measure of health as of genius. Their physical,
constitutions resembled more those of bulls than of men.
Michael Angelo lay on his back for three rears pajnting
the Sistine Chapel. Rubens painted a life-size figure in
a morning of pleasant work, and went out to ride in the
afternoon. But Nature has dowered Mr. Whistler with
only genius. His artistic perceptions.are more exquisite
than Velasquez’s. He knows as much, possibly even a little
more, and yet the result is never quite equal. Why? A
question of health. Vest un temperament de chatte."
And Moore ends as a disciple : “ More than any other
painter, Mr. Whistler’s influence has made itself felt on
English art. More than any other man, Mr. Whistler has
helped to purge art of the vice of subject and belief that
the mission of the artist is to copy nature."
&
There was no pose about Whistler’s cheerful
irresponsibility ; he had the temperament of the can’t-be-
bothereds. His nerves were strung so highly that he
could not long maintain energy : a man of fits and starts,
he worked feverishly when in the vein, and collected his
strength anew in a following period of depression. Yet
the mere quantity of his work would do'notliseredit to a
man of persevering industry : several hundred etchings,
several score of paintings, and innumerable sketches and
drawings.
It is said that in Whistler’s Chelsea house two rooms
only were furnished. The others were full of furni-
ture, pictures, and- bric-ii-brac waiting to be un-
packed and arranged. Whistler never had the
money, or the time, or the energy to set the mass
in order. The large sums that he earned melted
away almost as soon as gained, and at last his creditors
installed a bailiff and advertised a sale. Whistler gave a
dinner-party while the auction-posters were on the house,
and the bailiff waited at table. In 1879 Whistler filed a
petition in insolvency for liquidation of his affairs “by
arrangement," and somebody printed a squib to the effeot
that
Of various ■“ arrangements ” we've had an array.
Black and white, gold and silver, and tawny and gray ;
But of all the arrangements there yet remains one,
And that‘s to arrange with the troublesome dun.
I*
Whistler stories abound— some o£ them well-
known. His retort to Oscar Wilde is famous. Said
Wilde, in admiration of a remark : " How I wish I had
said that, Jimmy !” “Never mind, Oscar: you will!”
Whistler’s acquaintances said that he would con such
mots in the manner of Sheridan, hoard them carefully.,
and lead up to them with the greatest pains so that they
might seem to flash out impromptu.
"Oh, Mr. Whistler,” said a lady, " I came down the
Thames this morning—such beautiful glimpses ! They
reminded me of your etchings." “ Y-e-e-s : Nature is
creeping up.”
When George Moore was still in the flush of his enthu-
siasm for Whistler, he was credited with the remark,
apropos the Portrait of. Miss Alexander•: “ This is your
masterpiece. I count you and Velasquez the two greatest
portrait-painters the world has seen.’,’ “But, my dear
fellow, why drag in Velasquez?”
One of Whistler’s early Venetian pictures, sold for a few
lire, was exhibited in a Bond-street shop at a high price.
Whistler came to see it, and found a band of critics and
disciples extolling its valuable quality. “ Look at that
background ! ’’ said Walter Sickert
to Roussel. “ And, see the deli-
cate outline of that tree 1 ” re
sponded Roussel. “ A master-
piece ! ” sang the chorus. Whistler
wiped his eye-glass and took a brief
look. “ Humph ! I remember it.
Why, it is n’t half finished ! ”
Portraits and photographs
of Whistler are numerous : that by
Mortimer Menpes being perhaps
the best known. The drawing by
Ernest Haskell here reproduced—
one of several done some years ago
seems to give the best idea of the
peculiar diablerie of Whistler’s ex-
pression. In the last ten years his
eccentricity of dress and appear-
ance became very pronounced.
“ His face was covered with count-
less wrinkles, but the complexion
remained clear. His brows were
unusually .bushy, and his glisten-
ing brown eyes peered out from
und era ;athlike snakes in the grass.
His hair” (wrote acontributor to
McClure’s Magazine in 1836) “is
the most amazing part of his get-
up. It is all arranged in. separate
curls, most artistically put to-
gether.” These were dyed black,
with the exception of the famous
lock in front, which was left quite
white, and on grand occasions was
tied up with a small ribbon.
One of Max Beerhohm's cari-
catures shows Whistler as he
appeared in the eighties “He
wore a very long black over-
coat, rather like that of one of the little men iu
‘Noah’s Ark,’ and a French top hat with the brim
sticking straight out. In his hand he carried a kind of
bamboo wand, -about four feet long and very thin.”
When he was seen walking, he was followed usually by a
bevy of appreciative small boys.
In his closing years Whistler realised the fable of the
ant and the grasshopper. He had lived too long. His
hand had lost its cunning, and he was in need of
money. He had become vieux jeu —out of date and
ridiculous ; and in Paris and London his vanity was
slighted. Money-lending creditors pursued him; and
he was sick, peevish, a martyr to neuralgia. His ending
ill ■ gloom and obscurity recalls Beau Brummell’s. He
took refuge in Brussels, where a year ago he was reported
seriously ill in an economical lodging-house. One can
imagine the rest. i

Her mouth was like a crimson lair
For Love to hide his pain.
Around her tawny breasts a wreath
Of red hibiscus glowed ;
Her huntress’ limbs, the tunic 'neath,
Like burnished copper slioived.
I saw the bosom rise and fall

D R MCLAUGHLIN*
Would you like to feel as vigorous as you were before
you wasted your strength ? To enjoy life again. To get up
in the morning refreshed by sleep, and not more tired than
when you went to bed? To have no weakness in the back
or “ come-and-go ” pains ? No Indigestion or Constipation ?
To know that your strength is not slipping away ? To
once more have bright eyes, healthy color in your cheeks,
and be confident that what other men can do is not im-
possible to you ? In do you want to be a man
among men ?
There is nothing so penetrating, nothing so invigorating,
nothing that will relieve weakness and pain as speedily and
surely as Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt. It is simple, but
grand. It assists Nature by a general reinforcement of the
vital energy.
General Debility,
_ . NORTH BANKSTOWN, N.S.W.
Dear Sirs, —Ife is now three months since I began the use of your No.
7 Belt; the effect is really surprising. I can move the right eye with
the same freedom as the left; hearing is almost perfect, and the noises
in the head almost at an end, and I feel in a better condition than I have
done for years past. I have suffered all my life with acidity, sometimes
very badly. At the present time I only remember it as a thing of the
past. I feel better than I have done for many years past. You are at
perfect liberty to make any use you please of this and any other letters.
The good to be obtained by the use of one of your Belts cannot be too
widely known. I am, Sir, gratefully yours, A. RAVENSWOOD.

ELECTRIC BELT
Listen to the praise of the greatest remedy that
Providence has ever put into the hands of man to do
good with. From every part of the universe daily
come words of gratitude and praise from men and
women who have been cured after years of hopeless
suffering and lingering misery. Chronic cases that
have been given up by the highest of the medical
profession have been cured, practically in a few
hours, actually in only a few days, for, from (the first
application of this grand “ Life Giver,” the patient
begins to mendr • It is the heat, the motive power,
the potent factor of life in the human body,
and will restore the tissues, develop the organs,
and make strong and robust men and women out
of weaklings.
Weak Back and Debility.
DAY DAWN, W.A.
Dear Sirs,—lt is just one month to-day since I started
treatment with your Belt, and, without doubt, it lias all the
properties you claim for it. I must say that it has wonderfully
improved my health so far. When the Belt came I was com-
pletely done, could not do anything in the shape of work, as
my back was terribly bad. I have never had lumbago since I
used the Belt. Lumbago used to play up with me. I cheer-
fully recommended it to everybody who needs a doctor.
I remain, yours faithfully, W. J. MILLIGAN.
iwr DO NOT BUY AN ELECTRIC BELT UMTII YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY DECIDES TO TAKE HO MORE DRUGS.
We do not advertise to sell you an Electric Belt, and when you come for one tell you that you don’t need electricity, that a Belt WITHOUT
drugs is useless. We insist that it is foolish for you to buy drugs. Drug treatment is expensive and useless if you have a really good Electric body
appliance. The reason WE DON’T TRY TO SELL YOU DRUGS is that our Belt is an Electric appliance, manufactured by practical Elec-
tricians, under our instructions and according to our patented specifications —not made by manufacturing jewellers, as all infringements generally
are, and because a genuine Electric Belt cures
without drug assistance. All our dealings are
consistent, all our assertions true ; we depend
entirely upon the merits of our Belt, and our
constant aim and course is to do good and cure
a sick man when we promise our Belt will do so.
NOTICE.
Do not be induced by a “low offer for cash ”
to pay out any money tor a “BELT” which you
have been led to believe you could secure tor
the asking. Write us tor an explanation of
how Belts are sold “FREE.”

Gum Blossoms.
On Monaro, in the summer, when the opal’s in the
sky,
And the West is flooded rose-red, green and gold;
When the hills are misty purple, when the day
birds homeward fly,
And the sheep are bleating, plaintive, from the
fold ;
Then there comes a soft, cool air-wave, blown
from distant, kindly seas,
And gently roughs my loved one’s golden hair;
And the white-stemmed, whispering trees, waving
softly in the breeze,
Waft the scent of sweet gum blossoms through
the air.
Gum blossoms ! Sweet white blossoms ! Ah, your
honey-golden scent
Can reach me even here, so far away !
I’m, in fancy, on Monaro—though my weary back
is bent
O’er the ledgers which record my working day.
In fancy, on Monaro I can see the river glow
With a radiance from the sunset, and I hear the
goblin blare
Of the kookaburra's laughter; and her hand’s in
mine, I know,
When I dream I’m on Monaro, and gum blossoms
scent the air.

At the Last.
The sky grows white with the moon,
Arid the sea yearns up to the night
As a soul to an unknown height,
Drawn thence by a starry rune.
Only a lost wind strays,
Like the breath of Passion blown
In the vault of the Night unknown;
And the heart in me sobs and says
“ After a while we, too,
Shall rest as the stars above,
When we have no more to do
With the dream of Life and Love.’
O Time ! thy feet that run
Over the hills arid waves,
Over the cradles and graves,
From the first to the farthest suri !
Some day thou too shalt cease—
Some way there ’ll come to thee
Death’s white tranquillity,
The boon of an awful peace —
When the latest grief shall flcjvv v ' " '
With the surge that drifts away,
And the night shall no more go
In its endless chase of day.
Then shall the worn heart rest,
Then shall the sad Sea yearn
No more for the Moon’s return
Like a bird on its frozen nest
Dead, with its young ones dead
Under her breast on the bough,
Where nothing can wake them now—
Not the Dawn, with its golden trea 1 :
Where Death has been good to all,
Glood to the mother and young
And the dreams are beyond recall,
And the songs have all been sung.
So, at the last, to sleep !
So, at the last, to be
Still as the dead, still sea I
Never to wake and weep,
Never to know Love’s pain,
Never to yearn on for
What is gone for evermore; >
To be as we were again,
Ere we came o’er the bourne of birth,
Ere we knew of the fading flowers,
Of Love and of Life on earth,
And the hearts that were not ours !

The house is oddly quiet—

His eyes are slow and heavy,
Breathing quick ;
His little pulse is flying—
Baby’s sick.
He scarce looks out the doorway,
Nothing cares
For joys of Alpine climbing
On the chairs.
There lie his little shovel
And his pick ;
No need to watch the pathway—
Baby’s sick
The house is all on tip-toes :
Shadows creep
And crouch about in corners—
He’s asleep.
“ Don’t let the new s-boy wake him !

Run out and take the paper—

MANY COMPLICATIONS LEFT BEHIND.
All Banished and Health Restored
by CLEMENTS TONIC. S
The Case of Mr. J. BARTLETT.
(BY A SYDNEY REPORTER.)
It is to the interest of this country that
all citizens should be so educated that they
may become a self-reliant and prosperous
people, and to put this idea into practical
effect a reporter was commissioned to bring
before the community a matter here dealt
with by Mr. James Bartlett, of No. 5
Patten’s Buildings, Kent-street, Sydney.
“In the time of a great epidemic,” said
Mr. Bartlett, “ when influenza was ram-
pant in Sydney, I was one of the many
who failed to elude that terrible disease.”
“Were you in danger of meeting with
serious consequences ? ” aske.d the writer.
“ There was every likelihood that I
would never get well again, as I was in a
frightfully low state for many months.
Matters went so badly with me that I
thought I was fighting a hopeless fight
against an overwhelming force, and. as I
1 was laid up for weeks, and could not do a
stroke of work for seven months, I think I
had good cause to form that opinion. I got
so thin and ghastly white that everybody
thought I was going into consumption, be-
sides getting awfully weak into the bar-
gain. ' The pains in my head were enough
to run away with one’s senses, being of that
heavy, depressing nature which makes the
victim feel as if there is only care and
Sorrow in the world, It was not the in-
fluenza-itself that I had to regret so much
as the effects it left behind, for my system
seemed so upside down that there was not
a sound part about me. My limbs were so
racked with aches that if I walked a few
} u -‘ us I had to sit down and rest for the
purpose of easing the pain, but another
reason why I could not go far without
taking a spell was because I used to turn
very giddy. Through that cause I nearly
fell down stairs several times, so
that I was almost afraid to move in case
of meeting with an accident. I wondered
what was the good of living in such misery,
for I had no energy, no pleasure, no any-
thing that was worth having. For weeks
and weeks I could not get any sleep, and
there was a feeling in my eyes as if they had
swelled up. A dark haze was visible at
every turn, my sight being so bad that I
could scarcely see, and if I wanted to get
anything for myself I had to grope about
as if it were dark. I could not hear very
distinctly either, owing to a strange drum-
ming in my ears, so that I was not much
use to anybody. Indeed, I was a nuisance
to myself, and would like to have been out
of the way of the persecuting pains which
came to the small of my back and almost
paralysed me whenever I stooped. This,
together with the thickness of my urine”
told me that my kidneys were disordered,
and I was afterwards told so by the doctors
whom I was treated by, with the additional
information that my liver was also dis-
eased.” '
“ Did they give you any medicine ? ”
“Of course they did, and I was never
behind hand in taking it, as my enforced
absence from work meant a great loss to
me, and I wanted to get better. But, some-
how, my condition remained stationary.
When I examined my tongue it was al-
ways furred and rough, while my mouth
had a foul taste as if I had been drinking.
Not a morsel of food could I enjoy, but I
am not one to give in till I am fairly beaten,
and I used to make myself eat; but it
would have been better if I had spared my-
self the trouble, as everything seemed to
decay in the stomach, and give rise to ex-
cessive torture in the form of windy spasms.
My chest also felt as if a piece of lead had
Ndged there for the purpose of stopping my
breath, and there was no relief to be got
till I vomited everything up again. The
weakness of my stomach was so advanced
that I could not keep my food down, so
that accounts for my feebleness and the loss
of flesh I sustained. There was also some-
thing wrong with my heart, which palpi-
tated as if I had been indulging in some ex-
cessive exercise, and with my nerves all
gone I was completely wrecked from every
point of view. A twitching pain below my
neck irritated me, but for that matter I
was always in an irritable moodj even the
sound of voices raised in laughter being
sufficient to annoy me; but ;I was so
desperate and despondent that jl did not
know what to do with myself.' In any
short stretches of sleep I got flashed
an awful picture upon my vision, and when
I woke up I could not help thinking that
something I dreaded would surely 1 happen,
although I recognised that death would
have been preferable to any more suffer-
ing.”
“ Why did you not try a change of
medicine ? ”
“If I had not done so I would not be
here to-day, as I u as sinking very fast after
the long and torturing captivity in the
hands of my diseases, when a fellow-work-
man prompted mo to try Clements Tonic.
It was not till I carried out liis advice that
the influenza was beaten, and now, after a
long and convincing experience, I am sure
there is no medicine on earth like Clements
Tonic, for after taking a couple of bottles I
was feeling a new interest in existence.
The improvement was then so marked that
I ventured to hope that a possibility still
existed that I would yet recover, and by
closely pursuing my latest course of treat-
ment my heartfelt hopes were gratified. [
started on the right track with a slight
appetite, which came thi'ough using
Clements Tonic, and which that medicine
continued to increase. Then my liver be-
gan to work more regularly, a fact which
afforded great relief in several ways. For
instance, my headaches slackened off, and
the sickly taste left my mouth, besides hav-
ing full use of my eyes in consequence of the
disappearance of the haziness before them.
The pains in my back and shoulders were
lighter than before, and I had no trouble in
breathing, as my chest was quite free from
oppression. A feeling of vigour crept
through my system through the medium of
Clements Tonic, and I was gaining in flesh
already, which showed that my food was
digesting well. I marvelled at the rapidity
with which my vomiting troubles were
stopped, while the action of Clements Tonic
on my nervous system could not be too
highly spoken of. When my liver and
kidneys had been relieved of all symptoms
of disease by Clements Tonic I hardly knew
how to suppress the gladness I felt, es-
pecially as no cause remained for anxiety
as to the state of my heart, which ceased
palpitating shortly after flatulence was
remedied. ”
“And now your health is perfect. I
believe ?” * ’
“It could not be better, for I took
Clements Tonic till I was cured outright,
and for the past three years I have scaled
oyer 13 stone. lam thankful to be able to
give this information, which you can pub-
lish in any way it pleases you.”

The Federal Capital.
The Federal Capital Commission report has
evoked a remarkable outburst of that anti-federal
fanaticism, which evidently still maintains great
strength in some of the States. At the outset
the Australian union was confronted with the
venomous hostility of certain sections of the
community—the newspaper proprietaries who saw
in it a lessening of the chances of corrupt conces-
sions, the selfish State politicians who recognised in
it a loss of their petty dignities, the anti-Austra-
lians who foresaw and feared the growth of a
stronger national spirit. In its working the
Federation has done nothing to lessen the antag-
onism of these people. Whilst lacking, so far, an
administration which, by declaring straightly and
without reservation for a fully national programme,
would inspire a fierce approbation in the minds of
the majority, and so overwhelm the hostility
of unpatriotic sections—the Federation has, on
the whole, been marked by a reasonably honest
and somewhat national policy. So the forces of
of dishonesty, of corruption have been
in no way conciliated, and, seeing that the union
must ever be a dangerous foe to their aspirations,
are united to hamper its development in all
possible ways. The Federal capital question pro-
vides a good battle-issue, and the forces of the
anti-Federalists are being rallied to a fight on
that point. They profess a variety of motives,
adopt various tactics, but a very little examina-
tion shows that they have one common spur to
action, hatred of the Federation—not of this
Australian Government merely, but of the whole
policy of union. The suggestion comes from one
quarter that the Federal Administration needs no
home of its own, but can continue indefinitely to
occupy f urnished lodgings in Melbourne, and be
hustled on the stairs by the stout landlords of the
Victorian Upper House. From another quarter
it is urged that, whilst lodgings on toler-
ance are the proper thing, they should
be in Sydney, not Melbourne. Yet another
suggestion is that a capital may be built, but it
must be with a minimum of territory and so
situated that, as regards access to the outside
world and to the various parts of the Common-
wealth, it shall be at the mercy of one State or
another, and as regards trade, dependent on
Sydney or on Melbourne. Unanimity is dis-
played on one point—that the natural and proper
site, which will give to the Federation a seaport
of its own and ample room for the development of
an independent city, must be tabooed. Whether
the Federation is to be bound down by Melbourne :
twine or Sydney string is a point of difference
among the anti-Federalists; but all are agreed
that it is to Jbe fettered. And the time is ripe for
the Federation, which is the supreme power in
the land, to say something quite firm, even rude,
on this subject. The Federation, in the hands of
its present rulers, has contracted a habit of being
rather temporising and politic in its replies to the
sour grumblings of the anti-Federalists. It would
redeem its reputation a good deal by leaving
politeness out of its dealings with them in this
matter.
» * • *
The Federal Constitution gives to the Austra-
lian Government the right to choose a capital site
anywhere in N.S.W., so long as the site is 100
miles from Sydney. The Constitution, in con-
ferring this power, said nothing about picking
on a spot the trade from which would feed
Sydney, or Melbourne; suggested nothing
about placing the capital within the area of
influence of any of the big daily newspapers.
What it did suggest strongly by implication was
that the site should be such as to give the capital
an independent position, away from the shadow
of any of the great cities, and guarded from any
State Government interference. The absurd
claim has been made by Joseph Carruthers
that, according to the Constitution, N.S.W., and
N.S.W. alone, has the power to choose the site,
since the Federation must acquire the land, or
most of it, from the N.S.W. Government, and a
clause of the Act of union provides that land may
not be resumed by the Federation from a State
without the State’s permission. That it is pos-
sible to twist the Constitution into an apparent
sanction of this contention is a fact. From a
police court attorney’s point of view, many Acts
of Parliament can be turned to strange meanings ;
there is a clause of the Criminal Law Amendment
Act of N.S.W., for instance, which could be
interpreted to mean that every devoted husband
in the community is liable to 15 years penal
servitude. But, fortunately, serious legislation is
not usually treated in a spirit of ievity by digni-
fied courts. Where a plain meaning is possible, and
that plain meaning was the obvious intention of the
law-makers, it holds good, in spite of any ingenious
misreadings that may be possible. The Australian
Constitution did not give the Federation power
to generally resume a State’s lands without
the State’s consent, but made an exception in the
case of the Federal capital area. It made it man-
datory for the Australian Government to choose
that area and for the N.S.W. Government to
grant it without payment. That is the position
which N.S.W. herself sought to establish when,
by the treachery of George Reid, the first
Federal referendum failed—handicapped by a
minimum vote provision and further weighted by
his dishonest Yes-No. It is the position which
the other States conceded to N.S.W. querulous-
ness; and it is the position which now N.S.W.
anti-Federalists, led by the S.M. Herald and the
D. Telegraph and Joseph Carruthers, seek to
repudiate, on a law point which the brassiest of
attorneys would hesitate to bring before a court
of petty sessions. Part of the service which Syd-
ney daily newspapers and Sydney dreary politi-
cians seek to do their State is to always represent
it as a cranky infant howling for all the toys
and all the sweets in the nursery, and raising a
law point when another State ventures to even
look at its picture-book. But Joseph Carruthers
and the Sydney Freetrade newspapers to the con-
trary notwithstanding, it is absolutely certain
that the Australian Parliament has the fullest
power to choose its capital site, with as large an
area as it likes within reason, provided that it keeps
out of the 100 miles radius from Sydney. The
contention of Joseph Carruthers, backed up by
the Freetrade press, that it must accept any area
offered by N.S.W., even a sand-patch out at the
back of Bourke, is the foolish imagining of a man
whose ideas of Constitutional law are evidently
gleaned from the practice of a “ pointing ” police-
court solicitor.
• * * «
In th« exercise of its power to choose a capital
the Federation should submit to no dictation, or
even suggestion, from any State. It should ignore
absolutely the whines which may arise in N.S.W.
or in Victoria, and come to a decision based on
the needs of Australia as a whole. Whether the
Argus or the Daily Telegraph will have the
better chance of supplying the Federal capital
with absurdly padded cables and twisted politics
is no business of the Federation. Whether the
calico for the capital’s bed-linen will come from
Robert Reid’s store or William M'Millan’s is
another entirely unimportant circumstance; so
long as the invoice is right—which, unfortunately,
now that Kingston has left the Australian Minis-
try, it probably won’t be. It is Australia that is
to be served ; not a Sydney or Melbourne clique.
N.S.W., as the State most particularly insistent
in its lamentations over Federal injustice in the
matter of the capital, is the State which needs
particularly a telling rebuke. It has three
members in the Federal Cabinet —a larger
proportion than its population entitles it
to and a larger representation in the
Federal Parliament than any other State.
Further it has a constitutional guarantee that
the capital must be within its borders. A State
with an atom of dignity or of plain horse-sense
would, placed in this uniquely favorable position,
take up a dignified Australian attitude and pro-
fess, if it did not feel, a lofty disregard for small
State squabblings over the matter. With a royal
flush in hand anyone should be able to play a
calm and confident game. But N.S.W. is cursed
with a particularly undignified and poor-spirited
crowd of politicians and paper proprietors, who,
in their desire to damage the Federation, are will-
ing to drag their State’s dignity through any
puddle. But, however much Joseph Carruthers
and the Herald and the Telegraph may be-
spatter N.S.W. and expose their State as an un-
reasonable and foolish infant, the duty of the
Australian Government is in no wise affected. It
should treat N.S.W. and Victoria and all the
other States, as States, with absolute contempt,
and decide the capital matter purely in the light
of Australian needs.
• • • •
A decision on Australian lines would, as The
Bulletin has repeatedly shown, necessitate a
capital area of about 5000 square miles, embracing
a reasonably good seaport, with the Australian
Government as the sole ground landlord of the
territory. A less area than 5000 square miles
would fail to guarantee the full benefit to the
Federal Government of the increased land values
arising from the construction of the capital, and
would otherwise hamper the growth of the
Federal city. The Commonwealth must have
around its capital a district which is exclusively
its own, to provide food supplies for a fair-
sized city; which is sufficiently large to give
facilities for a wide range of manufactures ; and
which will enable the Government to have in its
own home its small-arms factory, its clothing
and other factories, its docks and arsenals and
shipyards. Further, it is vitally necessary that the
Federal Government should have an outlet of its
own to the sea, lest possibly a sour and embit-
tered State Government should attempt to
throttle its capital by refusing it decent railway
communication and allowing the roads to its
borders to go to ruin. Such folly does not seem
a probable event; but in view of the present
childish actions of the State-frights party, almost
any idiocy seems at least possible. One can’t be
too careful in dealing with a State which has the
Herald and the Telegraph as it chief advisers.
* * * *
There is only one site so far suggested which
meets all requirements, and that is an area
embracing the port of Eden and stretching back
to the highlands of Bombala. As regards natural
facilities and advantages, that site has been
proved clearly to be a good one, and proof of its
fitness is made more positive by the strong
hostility which every mention of it evokes from
the anti-Federal press. The Daily Telegraph
last week showed how the thought of .an entirely
suitable capital site vexes the enemies of the
union :
If Bombala were chosen, the Federal authorities would
have an opportunity, which they would probably take or
try to, of establishing a separate State there to an extent
which is not contemplated by the Constitution. Having
their own seaboard and a power to. acquire territory
which the Constitution does not limit precisely, they
would be under a certain temptation to create a kind of
toy State, of course at the expense of the rest of the
Commonwealth and inevitably to its lasting irritation.
There could not be a more cogent argument in
favor of the Eden-Bombala area. It is just
because that area gives the Commonwealth the
chance of breaking down State jealousies, and of
counteracting the viciQus centralising policy of
the great metropolitan cities, that its advantages
show out so clearly. As a rough and ready
principle the Federal Government may be assured
that in this matter, as in most others affecting the
Commonwealth, it cannot do better than to find
out what the Telegraph advises, and then do the
contrary.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Kingston Goes Out.
It is not necessary to accept the ostensible as the
real reason for C. C. Kingston’s departure from
the Barton Cabinet. In declining to continue in
office longer Kingston gives as his motive a dis-
agreement on a matter which is, after all, of mode
rather than of principle. His determination that
the Australian seaman shall be protected against
sweating, and the Australian ship-owner against
unfair competition at the hands of employers who
have not to conform to the same wage conditions,
is an admirable one, and his proposed method of
carrying it out—bringing all who participate in
Australian coastal shipping under the provisions
of an Australian Industrial Arbitration Act—is
simple and effective. The difficulties which, it is
professed, some of his colleagues saw in the en-
forcement of such legislation do not seem to have
any real existence. The United States of America
enforces much more rigorous terms in its coastal
trade —barring the foreigner out altogether. But
the Australian Government, whilstagreeing, or pro-
fessing to agree, entirely with Kingston as to the
end he had in view, disagreed, or professed to have
disagreed, with the means, and suggested another
method of reaching the same end which, though
not so good, was at any rate fairly good. In that
difference of opinion there is not sufficient material
for a Cabinet crisis. Taking Premier Barton as
representative of the Cabinet, his proposal was
that the Shipping Act should enforce certain
minimum rates of pay and that foreign shipowners
engaging in Australian coastal trade should
have to pay those rates. Kingston’s proposal—
characteristic of the man in its strength and
directness —was to provide in the Arbitration
Act that foreign shipowners trading between
Australian ports should be amenable to the court’s
decisions and its common rules, exactly the same
as local shipowners. The superiority of King-
ston’s method over the other is manifest. A
minimum wage enforced by a special Act would
be somewhat cumbrous; it could hardly provide
for absolutely equal conditions of employment.
But the application of the Arbitration Act to
every vessel trading between Australian ports
would. Still, convinced as Kingston was of the
superior effectiveness of his method of protecting
the Australian seamen and shipowners from
unfair foreign competition, he would hardly have
left the Cabinet on that disagreement alone.
It is necessary to conclude that there were other
points of difference, and Kingston’s letter of
resignation in a suggestive postscript
“ P.S. —I purposely refrain from reference to any other
point of difference.”
supports that conclusion. The plain fact of the
matter seems to be that Kingston finds himself
altogether out of step with the Barton Govern-
ment, which, since Barton’s return from London,
has drifted further away each week from the
democratic ideal. There have been several inci-
dents of late which have disgusted Australian
Nationalists —the Naval Tribute not the least of
them —and the drift of the Government away from
the sentiments which it was once supposed to
typify is shown by the fact that at recent
important divisions it has been directly opposed
by all the Radicals of the House of Representa-
tives; and where the Radicals are is Kingston’s
natural place. For what it has failed to do, as
much as for what it has done, the Federal Govern-
ment has lately brought keen disappointment to
Australian democrats. Kingston evidently wants
freedom from its shackles —a freer scope where
neither Barton drowses nor Lynk schemes. It is
not necessary, and would be foolish to believe,
that the last straw is the whole truss which over-
weighted his patience. Without a doubt the
resignation leaves the Barton Government
seriously weakened. Kingston has been its chief
member in the eyes of the public for months, and
is its only member who has made a popular repu-
tation as a Federal Minister. The public which
regards Lyne with disdain, Barton as a negli-
gable quantity, O’Connor and Deakin as
remarkably clever and—compared with most
—conspicuously trustworthy politicians, and
Turner as an intensely painstaking, cautious
and reliable financier, has had nothing but
frank, unlimited admiration for “Customs’’
Kingston. His courage and devotion to prin-
ciple have been all the more keenly appreciated
because as political attributes they have not
exactly been hackneyed of late in Australia.
Kingston’s defection is, therefore, in the true
sense, staggering to the Barton Cabinet. To
the country it is in one regard a loss, in another a
gain. Australia will lose an honest and firm
administrator, whose courage was equal to en-
countering dishonesty in high places, and who
can hardly be succeeded by anyone of the same
calibre. But- it will gain a patriotic and vigilant
watchman. The Opposition so far in the Australian
Parliament has been contemptible in the extreme,
with but little ability, with less industry, and
with practically no patriotism. So the Barton
Government has often had to be supported, very
reluctantly, because the alternative of a Govern-
ment formed from the other side was too awful to
contemplate. Now there will be a nucleus for a
National Opposition. With Kingston, vigorous
and vigilant, on the cross benches, the position
for Premier Barton will be a very much changed
one ; and the prospect of an ex-Premier Barton
will not be so disquieting for Australians. When
the issue was between Barton and Reid it was a
case of the less of two evils. There is now
another alternative.

The Maoriland Bona-Fide Traveller.
At odd times the Maoriland Courts struggle with
the problem of the “bona-fide” traveller. There
are already about 52 distinct legal definitions, so
that a man can go through a whole year and be a
different sort of “bona-fide traveller” every
Sunday, and each way is more impossible and
exasperating than the others. The Appeal Court
has just struggled with a test case. One Sunday
a man living at Sydenham rode to Sumner
(distance eight miles). He stayed there 20
minutes and left for home. On his way home he
stopped and had a drink at Heathcote, which is
four miles from either Sumner or Sydenham. The
prosecution of the publican at Heathcote formed
the basis of the appeal. The law provides that a
man may be served with liquor on a Sunday when
he “arrives from a journey,” and it is the defini-
tion of “arrival’’and of “journey” that causes
the trouble. The police have of late been prose-
cuting publicans vigorously, and, according to the
way it feels, the prosecution makes the following
contentions, and gets verdict? on them most of
time:—
vvliile a traveller may, on arrival from a journey, drink
one pint of beer legally, yet if he drinks two half-pints in
succession and without any apparent interval, the publi-
can is breaking the law.
If a man starts out from London to Wellington via
Auckland overland, and reaches a hotel on the way on a
Sunday, he is not entitled to a drink, as he won’t have
“ arrived from his journey ” till the lights of Wellington
loom up on the lee.
If a man starts from A to B, with the intention of re-
turning to A one day before he dies, he does nolr “ arrive
from a journey ’’ till he is hack at A again, where, if it is
Sunday, he cannot get a drink anyway.
If a man rides from A to B, the distance being outside
the three-mile radius, and gets a drink, and goes back
the way he came, the drink is a legal drink, hut if he re-
turns by some other road and so makes a round trip, then
the drink is not a legal drink. (This contention was
made by the Crown Prosecutor before the Appeal Court,
and was upheld).
It is illegal to sell a drink to a man on Sunday, even if
he has ridden fifty miles at full gallop, if the publican
doesn’t satisfy himself that the journey was not made
simply and solely to get the drink.
All of this, summed up, makes it appear that a publican
had better refuse to sell drink to a man on Sunday unless
the man can prove that he has that moment arrived from
Alaska; that he did not come solely in order to get a
drink ; that he did not have a drink on the way ; that the
journey really did give him a legitimate thirst, and that
he is never going any further as long as he lives, so that
his arrival is quite definite. Then the publican can give
him one drink, and a policeman will watch the perform-
ance, and then go and have doubts and lay an information
against the publican, and the chances are that the pub-
lican will be fined, and there will be another appeal, and
the Appeal Court will struggle with the situation for the
fifty-third time, and provide the thirsty Maorilander
with a new way of being a bona-fide traveller to last
him into the first week of the second year. And all the
time Maoriland only wants one clear definition, and more
drinks.
By the way, during a licensing discussion before the
full Bench of Maoriland Supreme Court, the Chief Justice
said : “ Another extraordinary thing is, that if a man
makes a false representation and gets liquor, he is liable
to a fine of £5. If he makes a false representation and
does not get the liquor he is fined £20.”
Land Grant Railways.
The Perth Morning Herald wants to know
why Premier James doesn’t do something to
break up the Midland Railway’s land monopoly ;
and adds:
Why land-grant railways in Westralia should—as
compared with State-owned lines—have answered' so
ill both for their owners and the State is a question that
will occur to many who are acquainted with the remark-
able developments which similar undertakings have
gained for Canada. That the system has been a complete
failure in this part of the world both our two great land-
grant propositions have established.
And probably if the Morning Herald were in
Canada it would read that the land-system of rail-
ways had proved a great success in Australia, and
on that information it would ask how it happens
The Pem on.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I went to get my pension out—
You see I’m gettin’ grey,
And rheumatiz has built a nest
Where Springtime used to play;
A fat official looks me up
And then he looks me down:
“ I hope yer reppitation’s good
Within yer little town.
“ You’re sure you never took to drink,
Or broke the country’s lor,
Or spent a spell within a cell
Behind a prison-door;
You couldn’t earn a bob a day
No matter how you tried ?
And now you’ll take your Bible oath
To show you haven’t lied.”
I’d got (I thought) as good a claim
As e’er a dook or judge;
It never struck me ’twas a dole
They’d give you with a grudge;
I never had a princely screw,
Since toiling I began;
I only worked for common pay,
Just like a common man.
And savin’s not an easy game
When times aregoin’ slow,
And things are hard and work is slack
And troubles seem to grow;
Twas once the wife whose sickness came.
Then I —l had a fall,
And doctors’ bills came thick and fast
And took our little all.
So when I saw the Pensions come
My heart was drummin’ gay,
I didn’t want a pauper’s home
To close my weary day ;
You see my neck was always stiff,
My work was always true,
And by this pension scheme I thought
The country felt it, too.
But—seems to me—l reckoned wrong,
For, since I gave my name,
A sort o’ shadow seems to fall
And cloud the door wi’ shame ;
I hear the p’lice are lookin’ out
A nd siftin’ every tale;
And, if they doubt the rheumatiz,
You will not doubt the gaol.
I never thought the Pension meant —
“ A Pauper till you die ! ”
I’ve not been used to bow and beg—
I’ve not been used to lie;
So now the Statesmen cut us down
And cry— “ Retrenchment Ho! ”
I’ll fling with pride their dole aside
And let the Pension go!
PHILANDER FLAM.


that a system which does so well in Australia is so
much of a failure in Canada. A whole lot
of things that are alleged to be great
successes a long way off are not reckoned
to be even small successes by the people
whose corns they are treading on. The only ab-
solutely safe plan is, having tried the weight of a
thing on our own corns, and found that it isn t
pleasant, to drop it—it is mere foolishness to rely
upon the probably unreliable yarn that it hasn t
proved at all heavy on someone else’s corns. The
tale that the land-grant system has been a huge
success in Canada is pretty certainly unreliable.
As the Ottawa correspondent of the Conservative
Otago (M.L.) Daily Times put it lately
The judgment of the people, enlightened by a some
what bitter experience during the past five years, has
now swung to the other side. .. . After having spoken
reproachfully for a generation of Government ownership
in railways, our people are now strongly in favor of carry-
ing the Government railway system to the Pacific Coast.
In fact, the conditions which have sprung up within the
last six years have changed the view of our people in
many respects.
So, after all, the story of the enormous, sucoess of
the land-grant and subsidy system in Canada
seems to have been all a flam.
The Remedy for the N.S.W. Public Works
Muddle.
The Bulletin reeeives a lengthy communication
from “ A.M.” as to the best way of abolishing
Owe’Sullivanism. The gist of it is as follows :
The N.S.W. Public Works Department should be re-
organised and placed under the control of a Board of
Management entirely free from political influences.
There should be a competent man at the head of the
Board, with a salary commensurate with the responsi-
bilities attaching to the position. The chief, perhaps,
should be imported from America as the State wants a
hustler in charge. The State could afford to pay £4OOO a
year to an official who, if competent, would save it several
times his salary. The Board would have complete control
of constructive operations and have the same powers over
its employees as the Railway Commissioners. The Depart-
ment would be placed under the jurisdiction of the
Arbitration Court, so that it would have no opportunity
of reducing wages below the ruling rates or of introducing
evils which possibly an American-trained captain of
industry might have a liking for.
This is the sort of proposition that makes The
Bulletin feel sorry. It is so pathetic in its help-
lessness, and its confidence in the shibboleth of
“abolishing political influence,” and in its utter
inability to realise the real nature of the disease.
There is no refuge from corruption in importing a
man from America—the land of the trust octopus,
of Tammany, of the ward politician, andthebood-
ling alderman, and the gentleman who said he and
his partners discussed the advisability of bribing
AlfredDeakin but decided the idea was of no use,
and that they had struck in Australia, that in-
credible thing—an incorruptible politician. The
Public Works Department, too, can’t be run by a
non-political board like the railways. It is mostly
a Department which spends money on works
yielding no direct return. The Railways can be
worked on the business rule of not building any
new line that doesn’t hold out good promise of
paying so much per cent., but there is no such
business rule about roads, culverts, and bridges.
And if it is held that the one way to make
everything right is to put everything under
non-political management, and place one De-
partment after another in charge of a possibly
corrupt despot, then Parliament might as well be
abolished altogether. The theory that Australians
are unfit to manage their own affairs, and that the
remedy for everything is to give almost unlimited
powers to some foreign boss, certainly suggests the
abolition of Parliament. Yet there is nothing
wrong with political management in itself —only
with the circumstances attaching to it.
The simple, obvious, effective remedy lies in
the abolition of borrowing and the abolition
of the practice of using the proceeds of land sales
as revenue instead of applying them to public
works or in reduction of the public debt. It is
only the loan disease which makesOwe’Sullivanism
possible, and which has bloated out the roads and
bridges member to his present dimensions. The
fact that extravagance doesn’t mean extra taxation
in the present but merely so much more liability
to hand down to posterity (and who cares for pos-
terity ?) is the one thing which makes the country
careless about extravagance. The fact that a
Ministry can gain popularity by scattering useless
or needless public works with both hands, and
being lavish about the “dirt money,” without gain-
ing any corresponding unpopularity by increasing
the taxes to pay for these things, is the reason
why Owe’Sullivan exists. The circumstance that
bridges and culverts drop down from the skies in
a manner of speaking, causes the department-
trotting member to be looked upon as an un-
alloyed benefactor, whereas if there were no loans
he would be looked upon partly as a benefactor
and partly as a noxious person who increased the
taxes, and one aspect would largely counteract
the other. If Owe’Sullivan’s Fitzroy Dock
muddle meant, as a matter of absolute necessity,
that the Owe’Sullivan Government must increase
the taxes, amid general execration, to pay for the
muddle, then a very different Owe’Sullivan
would have run a very different kind of dock.
The beginning, middle and end of political con-
fusion, corruption, incapacity and extravagance in
Australia is the loan disease and the habit of using
land-sale money as revenue. If these evils did
not exist no man could gain applause by
throwing away public funds, for the result would
come home to the whole community at once, and
for one blessing there would be ten or a hundred
execrations. Under a non-borrowing regime,
rigid purity of administration and the art of
making a shilling do the work of half-a-crown
would become the great public virtues of Aus-
tralia ; and the Ministry would get out of the
pottering habit of taking a personal interest in
Bill’s “dirt money,” because it.would have other
votes besides Bill’s to consider. But no mere
.scheme for shifting departments from political con-
trol would do any permanent good.

The Fitzroy Dock Report.
Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan writes as follows :
Your article on the above subject, though vigorous, is
very misleading. It is clear from its terms that you have
taken your views from certain official evidence only—
from men whose positions were at stake. Why rely upon
ex parte testimony in a case like this ? It is not correct,
as you imply, that I am the author of the political patron-
age and other abuses whicli prevailed at both Docks at
Cockatoo. The evidence of independent witnesses proves
that a very unsatisfactory state of things existed in these
directions long before I took office. Two previous investi-
gations had been made into complaints about the Docks,
but very little action was taken with regard to them.
Under my predecessors, men defied overseers to dismiss
them pointing out that they had influential Ministers at
their back. Even lately, confusion prevailed owing to
quarrels between overseers, and factions existed bearing
the names of these overseers. There was a lack of con-
trol and a want of discipline that told against the execu-
tion of work at a fair cost. It is notorious that heads of
branches for that reason did not care to send their work
to the Dock. Mr. Hickson; late Under secretary for
Public Works, who ought to know better than any man,
gave the following evidence in reply to questions put to
him: ■
Q We have it in evidence that there was very little
interference up to a few years ago ?
A. There was always interference, more or less.
Q. What shape did it take in your time ?
A. It took this shape: If the foreman or superin-
tendent thought a man was not fit for the work
he dismissed him. Some member would make a
representation, and the man would be put back
again after a while. A good deal of that was
done.
This was before my time. Where, then, is the justice of
imputing to me the blame of introducing political
interference 1 All I did was to follow the prac-
tice of my predecessors, and then only in cases
of distress, generally marking the note, “if there
is a vacancy.” I am really the man who killed political
influence at the Dock. When I took office I found that
trades unionists were not in favor at the Dock, but I took
care to put them on a fair footing with other men.
When I did so some non-unionists were discharged
to embarrass me, but these I at once re-instated. Small-
minded and tyrannical actions of this kind frequently
occurred, and I never failed to give justice to the men
when they complained. Why should I not do so?
A Minister should rule as well as reign, and he is the
last Court of Appeal for those who cannot get justice
elsewhere. These are the real complaints against my
administration of affairs at the Dock, and I am not
ashamed of them. You may, if you please, call them
“ Owe’Sullivanism,” but there are 60,000 trades unionists
in New South Wales, besides tens of thousands of fair-
minded persons not in unions, who will be inclined to
term it a policy of right and justice. That I was justified
in my action is proved by the change of Superintendents
at the Dock and other reforms which will save the
country about £30,000 per annum. What you absurdly
call “ The Owe’Sullivan Infamy ” is, therefore, rather a
benefit than a bane to New South Wales.
In reply to which—
(l) The Bulletin took its facts from a report of the Eoyal
Commission on the Cockatoo Island Docks. This Com-
mission was appointed by the See-Owe’Sullivan Govern-
ment and was sworn to make a judicial inquiry ; the evi-
dence taken by it was all on oath. If Mr. Owe’Sullivan
wishes to impugn that report, either on the ground of
corruption on the part of the Commissioners, or whole-
sale perjury on the part of the witnesses, why does he
not say so directly ?
(2) It is true that “ a very unsatisfactory state of things"
existed at the dock “ long before Mr. Owe’Sullivan took
office ” —so long before, indeed, that the fact hasn’t much
pertinence to the present issue. In 1887, it seems, the
dock was in a very bad way. In 1899, however (Mr.
Owe’Sullivan came into office in Sept., 1899), an inquiry •
as to the dock was held, and it was reported “ that the
officers then employed were competent and steady, that
the staff was insufficient, that the superintendent had
full power to take on or discharge men, as the exigencies
of the work may require, and that he was untrammelled
in this respect and in the management of the men.” In
April 1903 (Mr. Owe’Sullivan had' been then nearly
four years in office) another inquiry was held, and
it was then reported that political influence was rife;
that the office of superintendent was degraded by
Ministerial interference and left without real authority;
that Mr. Owe’Sullivan at his own instance and at the
dictation of politicians insisted on men being “ put on,”
prevented men from being dismissed, decided questions
as to individual increases and allowances ; and that “ the
Minister’s direct and active interest in all matters con-
nected with the employment and control of the men has
reduced all the officials nominally responsible for the dock
to figureheads.” It is for the difference between 1899 and
1903 that Mr. Owe’Sullivan is to be held responsible, and
that is the difference between moderate efficiency and
ruinous extravagance under scandalous political inter-
ference.
(3) The by.play about trades-unionism and the 60,000
trades-unionists’is characteristic Owe’Sullivanese, but it
has nothing todo with the case. It is, unfortunately, quite
possible that very many trades-unionists will endorse the
Owe’Sullivan policy, because it gave some trades-
unionists petty and dishonest advantages, just as a great
many people will endorse any injustice, or extravagance,
or dishonesty from which they get a personal benefit.
B,ut if it is a fact—which we very much doubt—that
60,000 trades-unionists will support the Owe’Sullivan in
wasting the country’s money and dragging the principle
of State enterprise in the dust, it doesn’t alter the merits
of the case one atom. If 600,000 people were willing to
sacrifice a great principle for a little dirt-money the
principle wouldn’t be affected thereby.
(4) The claim of Mr. Owe’Sullivan that he really
deserves credit for having “ reformed ” the dock is sheer
impudence. A house-breaker interrupted in the transfer
to his cart of the last instalment of valuables, and
deciding, in consequence of that interruption, not to
appropriate any more that day, might just as well claim
credit for his honesty.
(5) It will be noticed that Mr. Owe’Sullivan gives no
promise that, having been checked at Fitzroy Dock, he
intends to take that as a hint to change his methods in
other quarters. There isn’t, in fact, a trace of sackcloth
or ashes about him. He seems mostly disposed to. whoop
with joy over the prospect of his misdoings securing for
him the support of “ 60,000 unionists."
The Queensland Loan and the Labor
Parties.
The Australian Labor parties are likely to soon
find themselves in a forked stick. Queensland
has just asked for a small loan of £750,000 —hardly
more than enough to make good the deficits of
the past two years—and the appeal would have
failed utterly but that the issue had been under-
written at a stiff price. That is to say, though there
are few legitimate buyers of the stock, speculators
promise, for a heavy consideration, to take up any
part of the loan that the public won’t take, and
take their chance of selling later on. So crowded,
however, is the market that even the offering of a
paltry £750,000 loan has been followed by a serious
drop in the price of stocks. Worse still, the
Times announces that no more Australian loans
will be underwritten in London for a long while to
come. The underwriters, it seems, are full up.
In earlier days, when they simply got their
percentage for guaranteeing the loan, and hadn’t
to take up any of it, the underwriting game
paid well. But year by year the public has
taken less of the loan, and the underwriters
have had to take more, and each time they found
their securities less saleable, till at last they
are loaded down with millions of our paper which
the public won’t take off their hands except at
a heavy loss. The game doesn’t pay; and the
more we borrow the lower go our securities,
and the underwriters’only hopes of selling their
accumulation grow still less. The only people
who have, for some years past, been lending us
money to any great extent, it is announced, refuse
to lend any more. The Queensland loan just
floated is to be the last. Assuming this story to
be true, several of the Parliamentary Labor
parties are in a bad position. They have cer-
tainly kept extravagant Governments in office.
They have held in the highest favor those
Ministers who have been guilty of the most
extravagance. While they have been, generally
speaking, anxious to have money spent, they
have taken no great interest in the raising of
money. They have fought hard for high
wages for workmen, for short working hours,
for State employment for the unemployed ; but
they have fought hardly at all for an absentee
tax, a stiff land tax, or a higher tax on income
derived from property. They have hardly madfe
the least attempt at promoting solvency and
honest finance. There have, in consequence,
been deficits, against which the Labor party made
no protest ; and while there are deficits there
must be either borrowing or repudiation of debts.
When we can’t borrow there will be a burst of
blind fury against those who have brought the
country to this pass. Just because the Labor
party has been to so great an extent allied with
extravagance, and has shown so little regard for
the question where the money was to come
from, the people will naturalljr turn to the
opponents of that party when it is necessary
to pursue a new policy. That happened in
Victoria; and the consequences were disastrous
to the workers and the poor and aged. The
Labor party’s particular business is to protect
these people ; yet for the severe trouble that came
upon them me Labor party was in this way very
largely responsible. If it had been known as the
party of honesty and fair dealing; if it had in-
sisted upon every State paying its way like an
honest person ; if it had been as much concerned
about paying the bill as it was about incurring the
debt, the people would have had no excuse for
going elsewhere for salvation, and then the salva-
vation would not have taken a shape so unpleasant
to the people in whom the Labor party is most in-
terested. Its failure and neglect hit its own
friends hardest in the end. The public must
turn away from Owe’Sullivan and his works
when the trouble comes, and it can’t do that now
without turning away from the Labor party,
which has identified itself with Owe’Sullivan.
When the public sees the part that the Labor
people have taken so far, how can it, as a
matter of ordinary commonsense, be expected to
entrust the carrying-out of the financial reform
policy to men who were so largely responsible for
the very opposite policy ? Then, if the people for
this reason rush into the arms of the opponents of
the Labor party, it means that the “economy
will take very much the same unpleasant shape
as it has taken in Victoria. Even at this late hour
the Laborites may, nevertheless, save themselves.
But they can only do it by showing unmistakably
that they are interested not simply m the spending
of money but also in the raising of money; that
they are capable of saying “No’’to a request
even to raise a workman’s wages, if there is no
money wherewith to pay. They must shake off
this evil reputation which they have acquired by
their neglect to interest themselves in the financial
side of politics. If they don’t, they are doomed.
Flogging the Corpse.
The Argus and its well-to-do friends are just now
making desperate efforts to keep alive or revive
the Kyabram nightmare, which pranced to such
effect at the last Vic. State elections. At the
time of writing it isn’t quite certain whether the
animal is dead or only intoxicated ; but the
Argus, hoping for the best, is using the whip
with great violence, and paid secretary and hired
agitator Dean, who has a salaried billet with the
animal, is waving his arms frantically and ex-
horting the apparently defunct to make an effort.
A day or two ago a commencement was made
with what was called “ The Country. Campaign,
and the opening meeting was held, in. an almost
invisible town in the western district, where
Dean, who had travelled 150 miles to reach them,
preached to seven men and a cattle-dog. This
meeting was typical of the present attitude of
“the country producer” towards the whole ’Pootra
business, though, of course, it may be only tempo-
rary weariness on his part. Even in Warrnam-
bool, a town 6f over 6000 inhabitants,, only about
20 people assembled to hear the glad tidings. The
exasperating feature of this case was that the
same hall had, only three weeks previously, been
thronged by a crowd of 700 to hear Tom Mann
denounce the’Pootra’s pet Government. To the
surprise and disgust of the “Reformers,’ Mann
had splendid receptions all over the Western
District—a district that reeks with Toryism—even
pastoral centres like Hamilton and Camperdown
giving him good meetings. It is probable that
the success of Mann’s tour had something to do
with the selection of the Western District for the
opening of the “Reform” campaign; and the
unfortunate part of the business is that, now that
the Dean pilgrimage is proving a failure, people
are beginning to contrast it with Mann’s success-
ful tour, and point the finger of contumely at the
’Pootra itself. The impudent attempt of the
league to interfere with the Federal Parliament,
in connection with the Judiciary Bill, is bitterly
resented by Democrats, who are nursing their
revenge for the approaching elections. The sud-
den falling in of Lancaster and Doddard’s
League, and the indifference with which
it is now regarded by the vast majority
of electors, is a comforting sign, and next
Victorian State, elections will exhibit a
very strong reaction from the high-water Tory
mania that obsessed Victoria last year. The
portly old gentlemen with side whiskers and tall
hats who ambled down to Melbourne, at their
country’s expense, a few weeks ago, talked about
the corpse as if it were really alive, and the daily
paper headings—“ Enthusiastic meeting of Re-
form Delegates,” and the like—no doubt helped
to keep up the delusion. By the time of the next
annual conference, however, Kyabram will pro-
bably have dropped so completely back into its
old obscurity that it will only be remembered by
its arrears of water rates.
♦
Interference With Private Enterprise.
It is reported with some pomp and. considerable
pride that a great combination is being arranged
in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland
to wipe the floor with the present Australian
“Socialist Labor Government ” at next election.
The Pastoralists’ Union has thrown in its lot with
the movement, and all the Tory elements of
society are included. In the manifestoes of the
combination it is declared that the foolish &nd
criminal interference with private enterprise that
is now going on must be suppressed, and Fat,
which has been for a time down below, must de-
finitely take its position on deck once more. The
Bulletin would feel some little sympathy even
with a movement of this kind if it could find out
where lies that great “ private enterprise ” about
which the Tory party rages so grievously. If
the great foundries, steel-nulls, shipbuilding
yards, textile factories, and so on of Australia
had been built up by a cruel policy of sweating, it
would be lamentable enough, but still the nidus-
tries would be there, and they would be something
to be proud of in a way. The trouble is to find
these great evidences of private enterprise. Aus-
tralia had many years of freedom from Labor
legislation, and except in Victoria, where a little
was done in the way of manufactures, the private
enterprise of the Tory crowd consisted almost
wholly in buying land from the State for a mere
song or getting it for nothing at all, and then
sitting down to watch the sheep grow and the bull
flourish by natural process. The country certainly
has banks and insurance offices largely owned in
Britain; railways, telegraphs and telephones, all
owned in Britain; drains, roads and harbors mostly
owned in Britain. Even its mines are getting to be
more and more owned in Britain every year. For
the rest, Australia imports more, in proportion to
population, than almost any other country on
earth, because, apart from the passive industries
of watching the sheep increase and the bull
flourish (which were just what Abraham did in
the backblocks of Genesis), it has less enterprise
than almost any other country on earth. Even
the sheep and bull industry is not up to Abra-
ham’s standard; it rests largely on cadging upon
the State for unprofitable railways, free railway
carriage, irrigation grants, and other aids, while
the old patriarch ran his industry on plain busi-
ness principles. The lamentation about the
State’s interference with private enterprise, on
the part of a class which never had any enterprise
worth mentioning, is a humorous affair. If the
Australian Tory party represented all the art,
enterprise and industry of Manchester, Glasgow,
Lyons, Rouen, Chicago, and Pittsburg combined,
instead of speaking mainly for a wool-wash and a
boiling-down establishment, it could hardly put
on more frill than it does.
The Age of Consent.
N.S.W. Parliament will shortly—at the instance
of Dr. Mackellar —approach that awkward sub-
ject, the Age of Consent law. At present, on
reaching the age of 14, a human female is legally
a woman in the sense that she can consent to
marriage, or to the rites of marriage without the i
ceremony. Dr. Mackellar proposes to raise
that age to 16, and there is a further sug-
gestion that 18 is a more fitting age. Probably,
to the minds of some, 80 would be even more
appropriate. The legal determination of the
age of female maturity is a subject on which a
general agreement is impossible, and a wise
decision most difficult. There is a section of male
maniacs against whom female infants need pro-
tection —the most effective protection the law can
design. There is, on the other hand, a large sec-
tion of vicious female children, abnormally pre-
cocious in physique and in wickedness, against
whom the male community needs to be guarded.
In Victoria, where the age of consent is 16,
there have arisen numerous scandalous cases
of hardened young wantons of under 16—
after, perhaps, two or three years of vice-
picking on some paramour as a subject of
blackmail, enforceable by threat of prosecution
for one of the most serious offences in the criminal
calendar. To put a check on the unhuman male
animal and at the same time to prevent, as far as
possible, the savage punishment of lads and men
who might be drawn into relations with females,
young in years but adult in body and depraved in
mind —that is the puzzling problem which con-
fronts the law. The majority of Australian-
females are certainly unfitted at 14 —men-
tally to gauge the responsibilities of mother-
hood, physically to undertake them. - At
16, it is equally certain, very many 'are
still unfitted. Development is a matter
which varies greatly. There are women at 12
and there are immature girls at 20. Wha,t is
wanted is that no female shall be persuaded into
a step possibly meaning motherhood when proper
physical development is lacking, and when mental
development is insufficient to allow her to gauge
its importance. (The mental question is, after
all, the more serious one ; it is against equity that
anyone should be persuaded into a contract, -
which Nature will, in most cases, insist on being
kept, whilst mentally an infant.) That is what is
wanted, and what seems also to be practically im-
possible, for it would call for an age of consent
varying from, say, 14 to 50; there are mentally de-
ficient women whom it would be a crime to co-
habit with at 50. What it is necessary to
bear in mind is that legislation is only wanted for
a very small—almost an infinitesimal—section of
the community, and that, with a high age of
consent, the number of lads made liable to savage
punishment for actions which are not, in the civil
sense, criminal, would be enormously increased.
A possible way out of the difficulty would be to
increase slightly the age at which consent is
lawful, making the proviso that it would
be a bar to conviction if an accused person
could show by medical evidence, either that the
prosecutrix had been previously of vicious life, or
that the accused was honestly deceived as to her
age, and she was, physically and mentally, mature
enough to give consent. That doesn’t seem a
very satisfactory solution. It would, perhaps, be
as well to leave things as they are—with a protec-
tion up to 14 against everyone, and up to 16
against a teacher, a guardian, or an employer.

An Implication.
An obscure and, at first sight, harmless-looking
Paragraph appeared in the papers a few days ago.
t was published simply as an item of political in-
telligence, and the fact that it was loaded doesn t
seem to have occurred seriously to anybody so far:
The Commonwealth Government has decided not to
propose any loan to Parliament for public works during
the present session, consequently only the most urgent
works will be carried out. Among those not to be carried
out are the reconstruction of the telephone bureaux in
Sydney and Melbourne.
That item doesn’t look much, but nothing morO:
nefarious has been compressed into so small a
space for a very long while. The off-hand manner
in which it assumes certain things as being too
obvious to require proof or argument makes it all
the more irritating. In six lines it is put forward
as a self-evident fact—a fact that doesn’t even need
to be stated at length—that borrowing is the
natural and inevitable condition of this country,
and that the Australian Government must bor-.
row just as it must breathe. It is assumed that the.
present non-borrowing attitude of the Australian
Government is, as a matter of course, only a tem-
porary attitude; that no one can possibly dream
of building public works without borrowingand
that the period of non-borrowingmustnecessarilybe
a period of st agnation when the most essential pub-
lic undertakings are hung up and public buildings
fall helplessly into disrepair—all for want of loans.
The telephone buildings of Sydney and Melbourne
were both built out of loans. The security having
’ decayed or become antiquated, though the debt is
as fresh as ever, it is taken for granted that anew
debt must be incurred to reconstruct the old
fallen-down assets. Also other works, not speci-
fied, are, as a matter of course, postponed till the
loans begin to rain down on us again. By such
implications the daily press keeps the delusion
alive that we are, in some way or other, a Peculiar
People, who, unlike all other peoples on earth,
can’t be expected to pay for any work whatever
out of our own resources, or to pay off any of our
back debts, or to even keep our mortgaged assets
in repair so that they can maintain a pretence of
being sufficient value for the loans they represent.
The anti-loan policy of the Australian Govern-
ment is absolutely worthless if it is allowed to be
understood that it is only kept up by postponing
necessary works. On that basis Federal borrowing
will commence just as soon as the heap of post-
poned works grows so large that further postpone-
ment is impossible. The idea must be got rid of
that the non-borrowing period is an interval
during which we necessarily slide back towards
aboriginal barbarism—during which all the public
undertakings that distinguish the Barton Govern-
ment from the King Billy Government must
needs decay so that, if the non-borrowing period
only lasts long enough, we will get back to the
Billy period in the long run. Australia requires
a Government whichlwill not borrow, and which
will at the same time, construct all necessary
public works even if it taxes the big Victorian
landlords to get the money. It requires a Govern-
ment that will make the non-borrowing policy
respectable and permanent—not one that associ-
ates it with decay, broken roofs, lack of paint,
lack of progress, and a general falling-in of the
public assets. And when Australia gets a differ-
ent kind of press—one that doesn’t imply things
like the above—it will get that kind of Gqvern-
ment. ,

Not until Nellie Stewart demonstrated the
fact in “ A Country Mouse” did Sydneysiders
realise the absolute, baby-lamb air of innocence
that may go with a short, waistless white frock, a
yellow plait, a wreath of forget-me-nots, long
mittens, and a mouth painted to the size and
Shape and color of a red daisy-bud. A wisp of
lace handkerchief which she—the Mouse—twists
around her blue-ribboned wrist as she looks up into
the faces of dissipated noblemen, and excuses her
ignorance with, “I live in the country, you
know,” completes a valuable set of “props”
—When manipulated by such an artist as Nellie.
A “Country Mouse” crept on to Sydney Royal
stage for the first time last Saturday, and gnawed
her way straight to the playgoer’s heart. She is
a 19-year-old girl “from Dorking,” by name
Angela Muir, and she comes to London to visit
high-placed relatives who are in a fast crowd. Into
this intriguing, cigarette-smoking, punt-shoving,
hansom-cabbing set Angela “brings a breath as
of new-mown hay.” So the men assert. And they
—the men—all feel “ the better for knowing her,”
and with tears in their eyes (hitherto fixed on
some neighbor’s wife) “ wish they had met her 10
years ago.” And all the time Angela is as sly as
a; bag of cats and is out for a titled hus-
band, whom, of course, she secures—after various
croquet parties and a very compromising situa-
tion from which she and her ducal lover escape
by flight up a sooty chimney. Among the sub-
sidiary characters is the fashionablv-fast Lady
Sylvia, who is tired of her solid, rich, middle-aged
brewer husband, and determines to elope with
one Honorable Mr. Vyse, who, in the meantime,
has fallen in love with the buttercup from Dork-
ing. Miss Minnie Sadler plays Lady Sylvia as the
woman with' superb gowns and no soul ought to be
played, and the part of her beer-making husband
Is a fine study in the hands of returned actor
C. B. YVestmacott. Hareourt Beatty, as Hoh.
Yyse, acts the male complement of Lady Sylvia
as well as such a featherweight part can be done.
Miss Cynthia Brooke made her debut on Saturday,
but hadn’t much chance to make anything else, in
part of a lady of quality who desires to marry
a tailor’s jag named Lord Robert Wyckham.
Lord Bob is played bv Sydney Stirling. Alfred
lapping is the idiotic old-young Duke, and Harry

Her Majesty’s Theatre, Sydney, which
took .fire some time in the dim back ages, and
burned Ben Hur's chariot, and the flaring city of
Antioch, and the great schemes of Messala, and
Pontius Pilate’s glory, and the lepers outside
Jerusalem and many other valuables, has been
resurrected. The partially-combusted building
lingered for so many months in ash and melan-
choly that it seemed to have settled dovyn into a
permanent desolation, but the work of resurrection
was done at last very suddenly. On Saturday
the resuscitated structure opens with a triple bill,
“Madame Butterfly,” which is new to Australia
—selected, perhaps, to signify that the old
singed theatrical caterpillar is itself again-*
“Kerry,” and “Cousin Joe.” J. C. William-
son, whose splendid record as an actor is
apt to be forgotten by a young generation of play-
goers that knows him onlv as Australia’s leading
manager, reappears as Kerry, a character that
was long so exclusively Iris own that it would be a
E to see it fair into other hands. It often
pens that when a retired veteran reappears on
the stage by General Desire, that military func-
tionary is afterwards very sorry he spoke, but in
this case he won’t be sorry. Mr. Williamson also
takes the part of Cousin jQe, and thsre also
General Desire will be almost certainly glad that
he signified himself. The new company includes
Misses Mollison, Susie Vaughan and Rose Mus-
grove, also Harry Plimmer a.n,d Philip Lytton.

same results by going to Sydney Criterion and
witnessing “ Because I Love You,” The Bulletin
doesn t know. It is the most gruesome horror of
tliewi iiter-even Anderson’s play of “The Stomach
at the Door didn’t quite equal it. The central
qharacter is a monstrosity—half human, half
vulturq, with talons instead of fingers, a beaked
nose, a croak, and.a latent thirst for blood. Into
the claws of this repulsive freak, in his subterra-
nean chamber of hprrors, the wicked woman, who
wants the_ khaki hero for herself, lures the
heroine, being-aided by an alleged scientist who
wants to study a question of heredity. Of
course, the khaki hero intervenes in time to
save the. but not before the audience
has been treated' to some repulsive nonsense,
bbakspeare had a,good deal to answer for when
hq.gave us Caliban, and created a precedent for
stage monstrosities but Shakspeare doesn’t ex-
cise Scudamore, about, whose production there is
nothing striking, apart from the monstrosity.
Oharles.Hollow.ay mounts the loathsome piece far
better than it deserves. Miss Beatrice Holloway
as Norina Chandos, who is trapped in the
monster’s quarters, gives further proof of her
natural abilities; her work is even and pains-
Vivian Edwards is a fairly satisfactory
khaki hero. _ Albert Lucas, as the uncanny
freak, hides his talons as much as possible, which
may be accounted to him for virtue. Miss Alice
Deorwyn and E. G. Coughlan have the comedy
parts and make a good deal of the poor material
they have to work upon. John Hesford, in one
ot the few parts that are not unreal, and Rose
Conroy, the passionate and unscrupulous lover,
may also be numbered among the successes.

American humor and sentiment will dis-
appear from Sydney Palace during the coming
week, to make place for ‘ ‘ Madame Sans Gene. ”
When the genuine American is not American
' mgo he is Napoleonic Jingo, and Frawley’s
comedy co. will probably prove quite at home in
oardou s comedy of the court of the great French
despot. Certainly Mr. Frawley should make a
good figure of Nap.

Probability and the man who wrote “The
Ladder of Life,” the resurrected melodrama at
Sydney Lyceum, were utter strangers. They
didn t meet in the first act, and the man didn’t
think it worth while afterwards to even get
so far acquainted as to tell Probability what
sort of weather it was. The plan of writing a
drama on these terms has its obvious advan-
tages. You can do what you like and don’t have
to explain why you do it. If you have a girl in a
room and want to kill her (Heaven only knows
why, but that doesn’t matter), you might stick
her with a knife or shoot her. (You have a gun
and a knife on you—you always have at the
.Lyceum.) But you don’t do anything so com-
mon ; you put her head under a steam-hammer.
Ihe hammer ought to come down thud, and that
would end the business ; but it doesn’t—it hangs
up long enough to let three Cockney High-
landers swing themselves down from the
ceding and save the girl. Then the curtain
comes down and you shout like mad in order
to see the girl saved the same way again; but, as
the mechanical effects won’t allow of that, the
orchestra strikes up and you buy three-pennorth
of peanuts instead. The bulk result is a succession
ot thrills and gorgeous tableaux which would be
impossible if Probability had any say in the
matter. The hammer business is printed in the
biggest type on the bills; but the crowd (and the
.Lyceum is nearly always crowded under Wm
Anderson’s management) likes the Storming of
J -A ei "!' ta °t P a rgai alI( i the Disembarkation of
the Gordon Highlanders best; they really are
striking and well-managed stage pictures. There
a £ e 5. cou P le of hundred people, or more, “on ”in
the disembarkation scene, besides a score or so of
horses—black horses, from somebody’s under-
takery and coffin-mill apparently ; very decorous
horses indeed. The players don’t amount to
much; stage manager (J. H. Nunn) is the
principal actor this time, and about the only
improvement he could make would be to issue
instructions that next time the Gordons
storm the heights of Dargai they should use
smokeless powder. Last Saturday night the
audience forgot its damp, cold feet, and demanded
that the Gordons should go on storming the
heights so long that by the time the curtain was
allowed to stay down' the building was filled
with smoke, and one couldn’t read on the adver-
tising “drop ” whose pills it is that cure that pale
feeling in tired people.

Sydney Tivoli strengthened its programme
considerably last week with W. C. Fields—a
clever juggler, who does some tricks after the
manner of Cinquevalli, and exhibits considerable
skill and some humor. Another newcomer is
Miss Frances Leslie, a pleasant soprano. The
entertainments of Rudinoff show no sign of stale-
ness; he does a new smoke picture now, and
varies his programme otherwise—in all except the
jokes; they are immutable.

At Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) the people

Vivacious frivol and distinctive humor can create
amusement from the most trumpery comedy
material, but the frivol of Miss Musgrove (a sweet
fotressin a sorrowful character such as Mini in

ot Claude Bantock are of no use to “The
Messenger Boy.” And there are others equally
incapable of manufacturing their own success..
Arthur Crane, Elsie Moore, Ernest Mozar and
James Hughes, especially James, are only crude
comedians possessed of the means to sing a good
song when they get it. Miss Lilian Digges is a.
sprightly, earnest young artist with an infinitesi-

batic Fred Leslie is quick and keen rather than

the Pace,” the latest production
at Melbourne Royal, is reminiscent of some by-
gone horse-dramas which were not so well ,ribbed-
up or so easy in their action. It breaks new
ground before turning into the beaten track. The
first scene shows a virtuous Baker dissipating the
remnants of his fortune in order that he may de-
vote himself to hard work without the encum-
brance of any worldly possession except his wife.
Ihe lady, who is Frances Ross, shares her hero’s
enthusiasm for this reckless slaughter of furni-
ture and effects. It seems that Baker’s for-
tune came to him from a dead uncle in the
usury line of business, and because uncle’s-
gold was ill-gotten the inheritor placates
an outraged Providence by spending his substance
in champagne luncheons and fox-hunting. There-
fore another usurer, a comparatively mild and
amiable robber named Abe Nathan, buys back
the spendthrift’s goods and chattels at an alarm-
ing reduction, and leaves him to battle impecuni-
P ie same old false suspicions and
difficulties wherefrom Baker has emerged trium-
phant in about forty-nine previous dramas.
Albert Norman, as a circus rider of Spanish
extraction, conducts tjie villainy against Baker,
with the assistance of the Betrayed Girl and her
furious wooden-headed father (Arthur Styan).
Brown and Miss Ireland, from the circus, also
Bland Holt, as a horsey person who was born
m a hay-loft, and weaned on oats' and Mrs.
Holt, as a familiar Ruth or Naomi character, are
ranged on the side of in-no-cence. Eventually
Albert Norman gets run to earth by Baker whilst
they are both performing in Brown’s circus, and
then the clouds roll away, and the wooden-headed
father apologises for his mistake. In the second
act, Baker had returned from a fox hunt with the
live body of Norman slung across the pommel of
his saddle, but in that case the capture of the
villain led to nothing definite. It was merely
introduced as an astounding event.
“ Going the Pace ” puts no strain on the
powers of the co. as far as the principal characters
are concerned, and some of the minor parts are
likewise played for all they are worth. Max
Maxwell and A. Scarlett, who often deserve to be
passed over with something harder than silence,
happen to fill their places very satisfactorily this
time. The erring spinster is not a brilliant
actress, but she has her good points, and it is
greatly to her credit that she hovers around the
dear old home in an ordinary impenitent costume
instead of a woeful cloak of invisible green.
Baker, Bland Holt and other important per-
formers of speaking parts are not more important
than the characters that don’t talk at all. The
last scene contains numerous horses, and twenty
silent ballet girls. There are horses at every
stage of the drama; horses ambling over a hurdle,
horses in a cab yard, horses running round an
arena with bounding jockeys and Mexican marvels
on their aged backs. The arrest of the villain is
an equestrian sensation, and the general verdict
on Blandolt’s show last Saturday was that it will
gee.

The Marshall-Hall Orchestra gave more
than a good concert at Melbourne Town Hall last
Saturday. With some 70 performers under his
command the masterful Professor led them to a
really splendid attack on the “Tannhauser”
Overture and the “Ride of the Valkyrie,” not to
mention two other Wagner pieces. As for the
principal item on the programme, Strauss’s
“Death and Transfiguration,” the Orchestra
didn’t account for the European reputation of
that pretentious tone-poem, although the Trans-
figuration end of it was impressive—about one-
tenth part as impressive as the bright and
heavenly section of Chopin’s Funeral March.

The first week of “The Serenade” at
Melbourne Princess’s brought some hope that
its weak-minded story will not prevent the music
and glitter of the opera-bouffe getting their
financial deserts. Given a more attractive and
nimble leading lady in the shoes of Madame
Slapoffski, and a Florence Young to sing the
music that falls to May Beatty, the tuneful
work would be popular enough. More
pleasing than “The Fortune Teller” it is
not less strong in sound and substance.
Even Edward Lauri’s conversational songs
have capital choral backgrounds, and the composi-
tion of the higher-toned numbers includes honey
and ginger as a rule. The vast unmusicianly
majority of the public can perceive airs as well as
graces in the music, and the average eyesight dis-
covers goodness in the spectacle. But the
“book” ! The foolishness of the book is now
declared to be a droll travesty of Wagner’s
“Meistersinger.” Melbourne has never met
“ Meistersinger ” on the stage, neither can it
be persuaded that “The Serenade” amounts to
a laughable burlesque of anything. The spirit of
humor is not in the show. The construction is
clumsy, and during the second half of the 2nd
act, when the narrative is particularly painful,
the management omits to modify the situation by
turning the lights down. This is a deplorable
instance of neglected opportunity.
The Westminster Abbey Concert Party
is returning from Ballarat or Bendigo, to give
two more last final definite departing farewells at
Melbourne Town Hall, the previous final having
turned great masses of money away from the
doors. These extra consolation concerts are
fixed for next Saturday (Ist. August) afternoon
and evening.

The new “turn” at Melbourne Opera
House is a comedy sketch by Fred Hallen and
Miss Mollie Fuller, who made a first appearance
on Saturday. Their sketch is only a brief event,
and with nothing else more important than Dan
Crawley, the jigging songster, the bill at Rickards’
seems to be in a state of waiting for reinforce-
ments.

“As You Like It ” is winding up the
season gloriously at the. Adelaide Royal. The
public rushed the “I’ream ” up to the very last,
but is less enthusiastic about the new play, which
was very well done by H. H. Vincent and the
Sherlock Holmes co. a few months back. Cynthia
Brooke and Dorothy Marsden are found, with
regret, to be out of the cast. Denny’s Touchstone
is at least equal to his rendering of Bottom, and
Bucklaw is much approved as the Melancholy
One. Comic opera is announced to follow.
At the Tivoli, the Boissetts have come
in with their knockabout “Bricklayer” sketch,
and Fields has gone away to Sydney with
his uncanny billiard-table. Victor Kelly is
a humorous, if somewhat aimless, item in this co.,
and Ernest Fitts produces a grand-opera bass!
Also there is a lady of uncertain age who per-
sonates coons, and asks the lady conducting the
■orchestra to “Shake them up, lilly gal! ” On one
■eventful evening a singer failed to remember the
words of an item which was being sung “by
request”; whereupon someone in the audience
insisted on having his money’s worth, and climbed
■on the stage to take it out of the corner-men.
The curtain fell on a general scrimmage, and Ade-
laide is still wondering whether the whole thing
was a pre-arranged “extra turn.”

That pathetic individual, N.S.W. Treasurer
Waddell, has made a proposition. He suggests that—his
State being at present a financial derelict andascoffed-at
wild cat on the London market- it should start a reform
by pledging itself not to borrow more than £1,500,000 a
year for the next ten years. The horribly inept Waddell
calls that refor’m ! It will take something very different
and much more energetic to save this distracted com-
munity. If Britain reformed the same way Britain would
borrow about £4",900,000 a year abroad in time of peace
and that wouldn’t be called reform ; it would be regarded
as the last thing possible in the way of disgrace and
bankruptcy. Treasurer Waddell, apparently, doesn’t
even begin to understand the nature of the situation.
The principal charge brought against this country is that
it has already built out of loans all the public works that,
considering the present size pf the population, have any
present chanceof paying their way; and that now it doesn’t
build works because they are really needed and will pay
their way, but hunts for something or anything in the
way of public jobs that will furnish an excuse for loans
in order to keep its population in wages. Other charges
are that it owes a darned lot too much already and
should pay something off the debt rather than add
£1,500,000 a year to it; and that after borrowing
£75,000,000 to “develop the magnificent natural re-
sources of the country ” these n sources should begin to
show' some capacity for standing by themselves. The
proposal, by way of a great reform, to only borrow
£1,500,000 a year for pauper relief is calculated to make
the foreign creditor sit up. When that ghastly extrava-
gance is called reform it must surely dawn on him that
he has been lending money to a very remarkable specimen
of humanity.

The paid-up capital is £85,000 ; on this and the reserves
at the commencement of the half-year (£62,979), the
profits were equal to £4 13s. lid. per cent, per annum,
as against £4 18s. sd. in the previous half, £5 os. Ild. in
the period ending June, 1902, and £4 ,19s. 9d. in that
ending December, 1901. The cash and liquid assets
(£72,530) represent 32 per cent, of the total liabilities to
the public (£226,700). Compared with the position
disclosed 12 months ago, there is no substantial change
anywhere; the slight reduction in profit is due to the
appearance of income tax among the items of expen-
diture. For that matter, indeed, there has been prac-
tically no change in the business during the past eight or
ten years ; deposits have been almost stationary, and the
somewhat larger business, with the shade higher average
profits, has been made possible by the steady, if not
rapid, accumulation of reserves.

“What,” asked a member in N.S.W. Assembly
the other night—“ what has been the shrinkage in the
cash deposits in the Savings Bank of N.S.W. and the
Post-Office Savings Bank for the six months ended June
30th as compared with the corresponding six months of
1902 ? ” And the Premier, after admitting that there had
been a falling-off, said in reply to the specific question—
“ It would be inadvisable to publish this information.”
So it is inadvisable for the State institutions, which hold
the shillings of the poor, to give (except once a year) the
information which is given every quarter, both as a
matter of course and as a matter of law, by the private
institutions which hold the pounds of the rich ! Surely
the people who 1, ,ve their savings in these public in-
stitutions have t! e right, as a matter of business, to as
much information as the depositors in the other banks
have ; and surely, as a matter of policy, a democratic
Government, which is supposed to trust the people, will
see that they get it. If it is a question of maintaining
confidence in the public banks, then the worst way to go
to woik is to say anything that may be taken as signify-
ing thao the truth is too awful to be revealed.

The N.S.W. Government is so hard-up that it
does not want to spend anything at Broken Hill in con-
nection with the water famine; and so it is giving the
impression that the trouble is practically over. Yet the
fact is that the water supply-, trained up mostly from
South Australia, is so inadequate that. they can’t spare
enough to even start the street trams (steam-motors)
running again.

On the shareholders’ funds as at the commencement of
the half-year (capital £1,168,041 and reserves £280,612)
the banking profit was equal to 11s. 7d. per cent, per
annum. This compares with recent results as follows :
June, 1900.. 6s. 2d. June, 1902 .. ss. lOd.
Dec., 1900.. 7s. 7d. Dec., 1902 .. 9s. 9d.
June, 1901.. £1 19s. 6d. June, 1903 .. 11s. 7d.
Dec., 1901.. 10s. 4d.
On capital alone for the past half year the return was 14s.
5d., as against 11s. lOd. for the preceding half-year. The
reserves now consist of ordinary reserve fund of £52,000,
undivided profit, £30,356 ; and a special reserve accumu-
lated by the repurchase of “ B ” deposits at a discount,
£220,830. The actual existence of these or any reserves
is, however, problematical. The total assets are £7,450,116,
it is stated ; but of this amount £5,963,842 is represented
by “ bills discounted, advances, and all other debts due,
and other assets at old valuations.” This item has
appeared practically in that form since 1897. What the
“ old valuations ’’ are has never been stated. Remember-
ing, however, the A. J.S. Bank’s large interest in pastoral
property and the serious decline which has taken place
during the last few years in that class of property, it is to
be feared that, if the valuations were brought up to date,
a considerable discrepancy would appear. In other
words, probably the real explanation of the very low
earnings per cent, of shareholders’ funds is that the
shareholders’ funds (the capital and reserves intact) are
not actually there wherewith to earn any more. Anyhow,
the banking profits for the half-year are not quite 3 per
cent, per annum on even the reserves alone, taking no
account of capital at all.
In the circumstances, it is impossible to say
what progress is being made. ' Ordinary current banking
profits are certainly improving. For the half-year they
are a good deal better than for any other term since the
cleaning-up, with a single exception ; and that exception
was due to a favorable cattle season in Queensland.
What depreciation, if any, of the assets included at the
“ old valuations ” is going on cannot, however, be stated ;
and so the real progress, if any, which is being made
cannot be estimated. The best feature disclosed is the
fairly rapid reduction of the reconstructed deposits :

This is a reduction of £954,658 in four years. In one
respect it isn’t a reduction to be proud of, of course ;
for it means, for the most part, that the bank has bought
hack its £1 1.0. U. for something a good deal less than
20s. The process may help to save the bank; still it is
not a nice way to be saved.
Comparing the position 12 months ago with that now
disclosed the principal items show up like this :

On new liabilities to the public, which are a first charge
on all the assets, the cash and liquid securities are
equivalent to over 97 per cent. The bank could pay the
whole of its depositors in coin or British Consols. This
is an unusually strong position. On the whole of the
liabilities to the public, including the old deposits, the
reserves are equal to just under 19 percent.

This is the smallest addition to reserves since the dividend
was put up to 10 per cent. Only three trustee cos. in the
Commonwealth pay 10 per cent., and if the Ballarat’s re-
cent movement continues there should soon be only two.
Still, on its paid-up capital (£15,000) and reserves at the
commencement of the half-year, the profits were equal
to £l3 4s. 7d. per eept. per annum; and that is very
handsome. Of the other two which pay 10 per cent., the
Westralian earned only £l3 Is. on the same basis, but
the other one, the Sydney Perpetual, made £l5 Bs. 6d.
The Ballarat, therefore, takes second place instead of the
first it lately held.

Just now the wholesale beer trade in Melbourne is “ cut*’
to the bone. At ordinary times there is little profit m
the business ; in a bad time, with malt and hops dear,
there is practically nothing'. And this co. is further
weighted with a great load of borrowed money, the
interest on which has, during the. past year, mopped up
about 40 per cent, of the total receipts.

The reserves, all but £1205, have gone “ to make provi-
sion for the old accounts in liquidation.” Whether
enough provision has yet been made cannot, however, be
told from the published accounts. As to the current
business, it is represented to have been rather more
profitable than usual. It began to look as though a rule
had been made that a profit should be shown of a pound
or two over the amount necessary to pay the 4 per cent,
dividend. Probably the heroic measure of wiping off the
reserves has allowed this policy to be changed, and it is
possible that the real current profit may be shown in the
future, and that it may be better than the amounts shown
latterly.
The paid-up capital of the City Bank of Sydney
is £400,000 ; and on this and the small amount which
was left after the £109,000 had been practically written
off, the profits were equal to £4 13s. 3d. per cent, per
annum. If the total amount of nominal reserves at the
commencement of the term is included, the return was
equal to £3 13s. 4d. per cent., as against £3 3s. 7d. calcu-
lated on the same basis for the preceding half-year ; but
for various reasons ft is doubtful whether the comparison
is worth much. The principal items in the present
accounts compare with those published 12 months ago in
t his way :

assets .. .. 338,438 319,598 18,840

Apart from the movement in connection with the re-
serves, the position certainly is no worse than it was 12
months ago ; the substantial increase in deposits is hope-
ful. Cash and liquid assets are equal to 25J per cent, of
total liabilities to the public.

Liquidator Templeton lias, after 13J years, got
very near the end of the disastrous Premier Permanent
Building Society (Melbourne). The total receipts have
been £l, 216,634, out of which the creditors have received
£1,008,431 ; and there is still a credit balance of £38,498,
out of which they will probably receive about £36,000.
Taking these last figures as accurate, the liquidation will
have cost £172,203 ; but this includes £62,754 spent on
paint and putty prior to the buildings being offered for
sale, as well as rates, taxes, and insurance. The actual
expenditure in commissions, charges, and costs
appears to have been £68,543, which is equal to
£5 12s. 6d. per cent, of total receipts. Assuming that
of the £38,498 now in hand the creditors will get £36,000,
and that the balance will be absorbed in liquidator’s
costs, then the latter alone (independent of agents’
commissions, law charges, etc.) will have amounted to
£2 13s. 6d. per cent, of total receipts. Considering the
tangle in which the society’s affairs had got this doesn’t
seem excessive. The results of the liquidation indicate
over again what a riotous life the society lived. Of 980
properties on hand when the liquidation began, only 402
were ultimately redeemed ; some of the other borrowers
hung on in a desperate struggle to pay interest until the
eighth year of the winding-up, and then had to give in.
The losses on this mortgage business totalled £453,856 ;
the society’s own speculations in freehold panned out
£259,096 to the bad ; making an aggregate loss of £693,321.
Of the total amount realised the unsecured creditors have
received only £94,146, in three poor little dividends
totalling 3s. 6d. in the £ ; what more they will get the
court has yet to say, but, only £36,000 being now
available, it will be little.

The Melbourne pottery firms have combined to

For a pastoral finance co. the S.A. firm has had a re-
markably good time ; it hasn’t had to “ pass” a dividend
since 1893, and half of the time it has been paying 9 per
cent., and earning more. On its paid-up capital
(£190,000) and reserves at the commencement of its
last year, its profits equalled almost 13 per cent.
Hitherto the co. has not had a formal reserve fund; it
has now, however, made a good start with £lO,OOO,
though it doesn’t say what it proposes to keep this
reserve in—whether in Government stocks or otherwise.
About the most striking feature of its recent history is
the steady growth of its banking business ; in June, 1899,
it reported “ Deposits and all other liabilities, £477,551,”
and from that point there has been a steady movement
until this year the item stands at £623,777. The liquid
assets, including money at short call and Government
stocks (the items are not separated), are equal to 32 per
cent, of these liabilities.

Queensland is almost desperately hard-up. It
did not make ends meet by £431,939 in 1901-2, and in the
past 12 months its deficit was £191,341. It is so hard
pushed that it has had to strike a poll-tax on its people,
and cut its charity and education votes to the bone. But
at Mt. Morgan it has a gold mine, owned chiefly by people
who don’t live in Australia, out of which dividends
amounting to £150,000 were paid, last year—earned by
digging up and carting away over half-a-million of the
natural wealth of the country. Of course, on a predatory
concern of this kind, the hard-up Government made a
large call. It did, indeed. It demanded a whole 10s.
income-tax, and got it, too. A strong Government like
Philp’s won’t stand any fooling.

The additions to reserve are still in the neighborhood of
40 per cent, of the profits ; and if that can be maintained
the increase of dividend is probably justified. Very few
concerns indeed can show such a two-years’ record of
progress—which, considering the nature of this respect-
able old pawn co.’s business, probably doesn’t say much
for the last two years as a general thing.

Not only was there a falling-off in the export business
(largely a war business) whose profits swelled the
figures for the previous year, but the co. has had
to pay drought-prices for the raw foodstuffs, with
the result that business could only be carried on
at a loss. Meantime, though the stock has been
reduced somewhat (from £110,212 to £94,386) book
debts have moved up from £20,388 to £29,799, and the
heavy total of unclaimed dividends has been reduced ; so
that the previous heavy liability on mortgage and
overdraft has gone up to £94,293—it was down to
£68,516 in 1899, and reached £84,809 in April, 1902. For
a co. with a paid-up capital of only £145,953, this is a
heavy weight to battle under ; the capital was probably
insufficient at the outset, and, with the company’s
expanding business, it has become obviously more and
more inadeouate since then. > *

No wonder Great Britain wants preferential-
trade relations with a few markets. In 1872 it found a
foreign market for £35,996,000 of iron and steel; in 1900,
in spite of the increase of population capable of producing
iron and steel, the exports were worth only £31,992,000.
Yet that is the trade which has held its own better than
almost any other. The export of cotton yarn has fallen
from £16,697,000 in 1872 to £7,740,000 in 1900 ; of hard-
ware and cutlery, Sheffield’s stand-by, from £5,089,000 to
£2,139,000 ; of woollen manufactures, from £32,383,000 to
£15,682,000 ; of linen manufactures, from £8,225,000 to
£5,224,000; of silk manufactures, from £4,084,000 to
£2,062,000. A country that could be content with a
movement like that must be a very cow-like country
indeed.

London Times’ criticisms on Australia’s loan

habit of pushing its defunct dictionaries and other
literary merchandise on to Australians on time payments.
The time-payment dictionary purchaser is really borrow-

heavier rates than he pays anywhere else.

The published accounts of this company are more or less
of a joke. An odd thousand or two bob up quite unex-
pectedly ; the company sold some land' long ago on
time-payment, and it has put the payments into a private
stocking until it reckons that enough has been made to
make it reasonably sure that the properties won’t come
back on its hands ; then it transfers something to the
balance-sheet, where the amount then appears as an
addition to a “ contingent account to provide for possible
loss on land sold on extended payments.” So far as the
balance-sheet shows, the bank has in cash and liquid
assets £37, while on deposit (with accrued interest) alone
it owes the public £13,318. The rest of its assets are
mostly “ balances due by land purchasers and borrowers.”
Presumably the bank has arranged so that its depositors
shall not call for their money in a hurry ; if it hasn’t, any*
thing might happen.

Queen Margaret (W.A.) has now the cages
working in the shaft on its South Clippsland leases, and
this will enable it to run the mill full time. The average
of the last three crushings, taken from ore broken during
development, has been 37dvvt. per ton. It is expected
the mine will produce about 900 oz. monthly. > At present
work is proceeding at three levels, but the fourth will be

paid a div.

Associated Northern ( W.A.) is pushing on with
the foundations of its treatment plant. All sorts of
rumors continue current as to the ore reserves ; the direc-
tors are again sending out William Griffiths to verify his
statements about the millions of sovereigns in sight.
Prof. Liveing and manager Boberts are as dumb as
oysters. The late Oapt. Bodda, unlike these two, was a
practical miner, and his right-hand man, Morgan, who
took all samples, and his assayer, who made all assays,
are still on the spot to verify or refute his statements.
The rich ore alleged to have been located by the diamond
drill at 912 ft. still refuses to be found, but the same thing
was experienced by Oapt. Parkes on the • adjoining
Oroya, the lode eventually being found 100 ft. east
of its supposed course. A diamond drill is working
on the Medindie Hill, next the Brown Hill, in
addition to the one boring on the Iron Monarch. No
reliable information can be gleaned as to the result* at
either of these drills. During its four years existence the
co. has treated 25,801 tons of ore for' 148,1960 z. of gold,
worth £592,780. Out of this £280,000 has been paid in
divs., and enough retained to pay for the new plant. In
addition, the original £lOO,OOO of working is still
available. Shipments of rich ores to smelters have been
resumed.

Sons of Gwalia, Leonora (W.A.), seems to
have fully surmounted its difficulties, and is gradually
improving its financial position. Costs of mining and
milling, which were 355. a year ago, are now reduced to
215., while total costs, including development and
upkeep, are only 325. 6d. a ton. As the ore treated is
worth £2 17s. 6d. a ton there is a net profit of £1 ss.
a ton, or £lO,OOO for the month. This compares with a
total net profit of only £38,100 for the whole of last year,
which shows a marked improvement. Beserves of ore
are estimated at about 200,000 tons, or two years’ supply,
worth 535. a ton, and have been increasing at the rate of
15,000 tons monthly. The shaft is down about 1600 ft.,
and eleven levels in all are being driven, most of the work':
being to the south. The mine was horriblymessed J ’'
before Loring’s time, and got to be known as the death
trap, owing to the numerous fatal accidents, which
occurred there.

The Pioneer Tin Mining Coy., of Bradshaw’s
Creek, Tasmania, which has had a most successful career,
as decided to increase its plant, and has placed an
order for a very large and powerful Suction Dredge and
appliances with the Austral Otis Engineering Company,
South Melbourne, who built its original plant. The
new dredge will be fitted with a 15" Sand pump, and a
compound condensing vertical engine of 450 horse power,
and two boilers of the marine type, fora working pressure
of 1601bs. to the square inch. The pontoon to carry this
plant will be 60ft. x 50ft. by a depth of sft. The plant will
be capable of raising 100 cubic yards of tin drift per hour
to a height of 80 feet into sluice boxes. The new plant is
very similar to the older one but contains improvements
in detail suggested by the two years experience of the
older plant. The latter has done excellent and con-
tinuous service since its first start. The average cost of
raising tin drift to a height of 70ft. during the period
above mentioned, including cost of all repairs and
renewals, has been less than 3d. per cubic yard.*

Mr. Mephan Ferguson, of Melbourne, reports
that there has been a great improvement in the general
outlook of the engineering business since the new year
started, and that his pipe making works in Melbourne
and Perth are working full-handed. Amongst the orders
now being executed at Footscray works is one for 7 miles
10 chains of 18in. diameter light steel spiral-riveted pipes
for the Victorian water supply; and at Perth works a
contract is in progress for over 6 miles of lOJin. diameter
spiral-riveted pipes, flanged joints, for the Greenbushes
Tin-Mining Syndicate. About two miles of these pipes
are to stand a test pressure of 8001 b. to the square inch.*

Ida H., Laverton (W.A.), continues to do fairly
well, and has just declared a further dividend of 10 per
cent., the same amount having been paid in April on
account of 1903 earnings. The issued capital of the co.
has been 54,000 in £1 shares; but the shares have now
been split into 216,000 scrip of ss. each, in addition to
which 24,000 are held in reserve. Three levels have been
hitherto worked, but the fourth has now- been started,
and it is in contemplation to double the mill and the
returns if the new level warrants it. The reef was very,
consistent in gold contents cn the surface, but pinched at
both ends, making it impossible to materially increase
ore reserves, owing to the. shortness of the chute opened
up. Shares are almost exclusively in the hands of :
“Boulder King” Waddington, who states that he has
split them to allow investors of limited means to acquire
an interest in a div.-paying mine ! The Laverton district,
where the mine is situated, has so far earned a very un-
enviable notoriety on account of the unreliability of its
reefs.

SOCIETY
[?]
At Ingham (N.Q.) recently, a “gentle”
Kanaka was sentenced to three months for
assault on a girl 16 years of age. He admitted
the crime, by the way. How tenderly and
mercifully Mongrelian justice handles its colored
brethren ! If common white trash does anything
of the kind, he is sentenced to five or ten years,
including solitary confinement. But “kind, gen-
tle, soft-hearted” Tommy Tanna receives three
months 1
NEARLY FATAL.
1ST. MAN : “Did you ever meet with an accident?”
2ND. MAN : “ Yes! When I met my wife"
Some members of a Maoriland lodge, who
intended travelling by train to the funeral of a
deceased brother, were shocked to find that the
body had been stowed away in the milk van, and
were more shocked on being told that it was the
“ usual thing” to dump corpses in with either the
milk or the meat.
‘D. : The R.C. clergy are before all
others at “ raising the wind;” The habit of read*
mg the quarterly collection-list
from the altar (after giving
notice the Sunday previous
so that the last straggler
may rush in with his
money) draws the guineas
like a ten - horse - power
magnet. When I was a
boy, M‘Guanne, the pub-
lican, headed the list for
years with ten guineas a
quarter. Then Casey,
who kept the other
pub., tied him, and
they were read out
quarter after quarter
“Michael M‘-
Guanne, ten guineas; Ter-
ence Casey, ten guineas,”
M'Guanne always keeping
senior place. Then bad
times struck Michael, and
one Sunday Casey had
the pleasure of hear-
ing himself thunder
out five guineas in
the lead of anybody
else, with “Michael
M‘Guan n e, a
guinea.” He looked
round at Michael’s
“sitting,’' but the
M'Guanne family
was absent; the dis-
grace was too much.
His reverence has a
peculiar way of in-
flecting a guinea sub.
which he thinks might
well have been two, and
the soft hint is often
taken. Last time I was
there M'Guanne was coming
strong again, but a heretic told
me he only gave a guinea but
was “called” for five, so as to
keep Casey up to the ten, Casey
having mentioned that the drought
might compel him to reduce his sub.
to five.
In order to kill time while time is getting
in its own deadly work, society must have some-
thing to do, so it spends its leisure in invent-
ing some new form of insanity with which to
startle its other self. The latest idea in Melbourne
was to cause the maids waiting at table to wear
belltoppers. The head-gear was cocked over the
left eye in a rakish sort of way, and created quite
a mild sensation at a recent big dinner function.
The next thing will be a maid reaching under your
chin in ballet costume, or handing round the
humble “spud’ in bathing dress—the waitress
not the “spud.”

They bring the gallows and other appur-
tenances of Justice to your door in New South
Wales. Judge Gibson and Crown Prosecutor
Bevan lately travelled from Sydney via Mel-
bourne and Adelaide to Wentworth (N.S.W.).
On opening the Quarter Sessions there was one
case for trial, the jury acquitted the accused, and
next morning the Judge and C.P. departed down
river per steamer to Adelaide on the return to
Sydney. That was a costly prisoner.
The Cold-tea apostles have been
enjoying themselves in the S. American
republic of Peru. The fun started
when they led President Romana
up to the penitent form, and
caused him to see the error of
his ways, and got him to
solemnly sign the pledge. In
his new - born
zeal he got his
party to pass
prohibition laws,
to come into
effect on April 1.
The distillers, how-
ever, prepared a
coup ; they offered
the army free drinks
for ever, and the army
struck a bargain on
the spot, and promptly
got drunk. Then, just
when the army was get-
ting sober, and while it
was looking for some-
thing wet to tie round
its head, the President
put in a higher bid—he
offered to raise the army’s
screw ; and the army
ratted back again. Then
the Government seized the distilleries, and
destroyed the stills, and when the last mail left it
was putting the premises up to auction.

The off-hand young Australian again.
Alleged, in a down-south Court, that a young
man of 22 or so, who had been roped into a secret
marriage by a pining maid of 45 or thereabouts,
thought that, as he hadn’t lived with the latter,
there wasn’t any harm in taking on another—this
time something less seasoned—aged about 17.
He is quite surprised at the prosecution for
bigamy which has followed.
QUITE IMPROBABLE.
OLD GENT ( to small boy who is nursing a skinned
knee): “Did you iall down, little chap?"
SMALL BOY : '"Ell. and Tommy! Yer didn’t
think I jell UP and bashed agin a cloud, did
yer?"
The mysterious French derelict who has
confessed to sending five bulletsthrough an ancient
recluse, near Dandenong (Vic.), in the hope of
plunder (his actual loot amounted to a pair of old
boots), has only his own folly to thank for his
arrest. Not even a rough description of the sus-
pected murderer could be got —he was merely
supposed to be a casual loafer wandering around.
After shooting the old man this extraordinary
ruffian got away as far as Gembrook, 30 miles
distant; then turned and meandered right
over the scene of his crime, where his peculiar
antics and his obtrusive desire to avoid
observation drew attention to him. The boots
and the black trackers did the rest.
Another health scandal in Sydney : Of
305 dwellings inspected by the Central Board of
Health in a Redfern area, 177 were unfit for
human habitation. There is not the slightest
hope of keeping the metropolitan area decently
clean until a Greater Sydney Government sweeps
away the dirty little suburban councils. The
average suburban council consists chiefly of the
local property owners and their agents, who sacri-
fice time and money to secure seats on an unpaid
body, soithat they can promote their own interests
as property-owners: and those interests they
often consider best served by giving themselves
full permission to save the cost of cleaning and
sewering and repairing their properties. The
sanitary inspection by the paid servant of such
people is in one respect a farce ; in another it is
a tragedy.
The Melbourne dailies spread themselves
at some length over the case of Miss Layton —the
St. Kilda “ hermit ” whom the local council
adjudged insanitary and subsequently removed to
Kew Asylum. In reality it was merely a sor-
did tale of a would-be-respectable street. The
poor old lady, who, a few years back, lost father,
mother and brother, had no friends in the country,
so brooded over her sorrows. Her home became
dilapidated, the fences disappeared, and a rank
!rowth of weeds and grass covered the garden.
'his deteriorated the value of adjacent property,
so certain aldermen decided that she was insane
and she was sent to the madhouse. It took Mel-
bourne four or five days to realise what it had
done, and then there were demands for her release.
It is notable that while the press grew very tear-
ful about the old lady’s grief for her lost relatives,
it didn’t dwell at all on the fact that her alleged
madness might be partly owing to the fact that
she lost most of her money in a highly respec-
table gentleman’s bank. The old lady’s house,
declared to be “insanitary,” was really very clean,
though ramshackle enough, and certainly it was
curious that St. Kilda council, which keeps a
most objectionable tip in a public park, should
rush anybody into a lunatic asylum because her
house hadn’t been painted recently. r

Committee of Melbourne Benevolent
Asylum has done a little to discourage the un-
common practice of bequeathing money to charit-
able institutions. Kingston, a former member of
the committee, died in England some months
back, and by his will devoted £27,000 —nearly the
whole of his property —towards Melbourne Bene-
volent Asylum. Also beset apart a sum of £5O
for fixing himself up comfortably in a London
cemetery after his decease. It happened that
James Kingston died in Devonshire, and the £5O
was swallowed by the expenses of conveying his
body to London and burying it in the family
grave. Previous inmates of the grave were
accorded tablets on the family tombstone. The
English legal managerof James Kingston’s funeral
thought that the deceased owner aud final occu-
pant of the grave should also have a tablet. He
wrote to the committeemen of the Benevolent,
asking them to vote £2O for Kingston’s tombstone.
The committee replied stating how sorry it was
that the by-laws prohibited it from allotting the
1350th part of Kingston’s bequest to the purpose
suggested. If a bequest of £27,000 doesn’t earn a
common £2O courtesy for the testator’s ghost, is it
likely that good old Kingston’s example will
tempt the average vainglorious capitalist to die
and do likewise ? All he wants is the whoop and
glory of the business. If there is neither whoop
nor glory what inducement is there? ,

The report of King Ned’s visit to Ireland :
As the Royal cortege passed along a woman,'in a fit of
enthusiasm, broke through the military cordon, and,
rushing to the side of the carriage, clasped Queen
Alexandra’s hand. Amid ringing cheers from the excited
multitude, her Majesty restrained a policeman from
arresting the enthusiast.
Good old stage-management! But why the
absence of a trained dove fluttering down with the
shamrock of suavity in his beak, and of an edu-
cated pig bowing low as he presented the potato of
prosperity? And what’s the matter with the
strange but faithful dog which ought to insist on
following the royal carriage?
THE PLACE OF BEST.
OLD LADY : “ Poor man! Is it talcin' him to
the hospital, ye are?"
FIRST BEARER: “O no! He's been given up by
all the doctors, so we’ve got him a job at the
Fitzroy Docks."
Bent acquired one brilliant idea while he
was wandering round the Mallee, what time he
was being rushed out of his Railways’ billet before
he could get back to object. When he saw Lake
Hattah (a woebegone swamp at the back of
beyond) he told a deputation that “he came to
the conclusion that it was an ideal site for a Con-
sumptive Hospital.” The idea has its points,
however; three or four beds would be enough,
and the railway returns on that line would go up
with a jump. Single fare up and corpse fare
down—and corpse rates are high.
PILGRIMS TO JAPAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Pars, in any issue of any paper.)
“A complimentary banquet was tendered to Alderman
Bosh last night, on the eve of his departure for a six
months’ holiday in Japan. Alderman Bosh will not be
accompanied by Mrs. Bosh.”
“.Councillor M'Smith returned from Japan by the s.s.
Yoshiwari yesterday, and was subsequently welcomed at
the town hall by the mayor and his brother-councillors.
In a short speech Councillor M’Smith said that he had
derived great pleasure and benefit from his trip, and
practically he felt like anew man.”
Let us sing a ballad Jappy of the brown land fair and
happy,
Where the Geisha twines a laurel round the pilgrim’s
aching brows!
Where our Judges go when weary of this common land
and beery,
And our aldermen in stacks beside the Inland Ocean
drowse.
Once the Saxon went a-grailing, but at present he goes
sailing
To the damsels of Tokio, to be soothed with palm and
fan ;
And he leaves behind the missus, and he stroketh tawny
tresses
When he joins the rising tide of pious pilgrims to Japan.
For their pilgrimage is pleasant, and the way shines
phosphorescent
To the weary ones that travel to that brown and happy
land ;
The chrysanthemums are waiting, and the blooms are
coruscating,
And the brownish damsel gently leads the pilgrim by the
hand.
And his bald head shineth brightly in the haunts of
pleasure nightly,
And his long ears flap with pleasure as he sits on the
divan.
O ! the track is much frequented; and few pilgrims are
contented,
Till they return again to worship at the shrines of old
Japan.

THE WINE OF LIFE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Give me the wine of Life—red wine—
With a brilliant sparkle gleaming.
I am tired of tame and tasteless joys
And the lazy life of dreaming.
Give me the passion, the fever glow,
The strength of a fervid loving ;
I am sick of a luke-warm, listless thing
That is hardly worth the proving.
'Stead of the sleepy lullabies
Give me Life’s music’s marches,
Only to feel alive, ALIVE,
Under the sky’s blue arches.
Down in the heart of the city’s heart,
’Mid living lives of men.
Give me the wine of Life—red wine
To drink to the dregs, and then !

The Melbourne butcher-boy who stuffed
liis girl’s baby into a ferret-cage, and then dropped
it into a creek, and the other butcher-boy who
helped him, have been sentenced to death ; but,
the jury having recommended the lads to mercy
on account of their age, Justice a’Beckett merely
passed sentence, and left out the millinery and
mummery generally associated with the tragic
business. The most remarkable feature in the
whole of this sordid patch of life is the cheerful
indifference of the butcher-boys. They never saw
anybody worry over sheep and calves, which were
worth something, when they were killed, and
they seem surprised in a brutish sort of way that
there should be all this fuss over a wholly unsale-
able infant that was only in the way, and didn’t
seem to be worth anything at all.

The emoanelling a jury to try the North-
cote (Melbj baby-murder case was a tedious pro-
cess. Old men were challenged on behalf of the
two young fellows who “put baby away,” whilst
the Crown challenged from an exactly opposite
point of view. Finally, a very young jury was
arrived at, but the prisoners might have got just
as kind a verdict—“ Guilty, with strong recom-
mendation to mercy on account of their youth ”
from 12 of the oldest of the rejected ones. On the
other hand, the Crown might have got an unquali-
fied hanging verdict from a dozen of the challenged
youngsters. As a matter of fact, there were one
or two notoriously humane veterans among the
“throw-outs.” Old men are apt to think of them-
selves as having been hard-hearted brutes 40 years
ago, and young men are disposed to feel unreason-
ably horrified at the careless brutality of their
contemporaries. An ancient, softened by family
troubles, sees in his own son a potential murderer,
but the son sees himself a much softer-hearted
chap than he is. Present scribe, speaking from
middle-aged experience, would advise all mur-
derers on trial to chance their luck with a jury of
sorrowful-looking greybeards.

“ Adelaide ” : British law has been turning
its usual somersaults. A month ago a professional
lady in Adelaide was acquitted because her clever
young counsel found a recent English case which
made “ dying depositions ” of no use unless they
were taken down verbatim, question with answer,
to show whether there was any prompting. Now
the mail brings news that that decision has still
more recently been contemptuously handled and
upset! The lady, having been found “Nob
Guilty ” on the legal point, can dwell in peace till
next time, but the point that secured her release
was taken just in time.
NOW IS THE TIME WHEN ALL THE
CARDINALS WILL GET A POL I SHIN’
OF THEIR BIG TOES.
This is the compressed diary of a man
from the Mallee who struck Melbourne a little
over a week ago. On Wednesday morning he
was drunk and addressing the public on a
device for diverting the water from the
gutter in Elizabeth-street into the North-West
country. Same day about noon he was drunker
and was run in. Late in the afternoon he was
comparatively sober and was let out on bail.
Same evening he was horribly and wonderfully
drunk and was run in again. In the court next
morning he met a drunken friend, and was so
overjoyed that, in the fullness of his heart, he paid
his own fine, his friend’s fine, and the fine of
a young man who was also in trouble. The three
departed to get drunk, when the young man
picked the friend’s pocket of all his cash and
belongings and fled. The friend went to look for
a detective while the man from the Mallee got
drunk on hi 3 solitary own. Later that day he
held forth to a considerable crowd in Bourke-
street on irrigation. In the afternoon he was at
Melbourne hospital being treated for bruises
received through falling down while lecturing on
irrigation. In the evening he was sitting in a
gutter buzzing like a large bee, and was run in.
At the police-station he insisted on regarding the
place as a public-house and said that his drink
was whisky. Next morning he was fined again
and urged to retire to his native fastnesses, as he
was evidently unsuited to the social atmosphere
of a large city. *•'

“R.A.K.”: Saw in South Melbourne,
the other day, a well-fed spinster-looking person
holding forth earnestly to a down-at-heel family
(father, mother and kid). She had a finger signi-
ficantly planted in the open page of a pocket
Bible. As I passed I heard : “And you’ll never
have any disease, and your bread will be sure. ”
The father looked especially hungry and woe-
begone, and gazed up and down the street as he
listened, as if he half expected to see a ticket to
S’Africa floating past on the breeze or dropped
from a tram. Put the spinster with the Bible
down for a Dowieite.
A subtle joke was played off on the unsus-
pecting spectators at the military demonstration
on Yarra bank the other night. The most inter-
esting business of the evening was an explosion of
submarine mines under the polluted river. Ihe
first was a small ladylike charge; it threw up
a delicate column of opalescent water which fell
gracefully to the depths again and behaved itself
admirably all through. Ihe crowd was encour-
aged, and pressed forward to the very edge of the
stream to view the next explosion. But an extra
large charge had been put in by the mill ary
humorists, and a regular waterspout arose,
carrying with it mud, dead cats, rags, bones and
old fellmongery, and all these fell like a,deluge
upon the onlookers. A hundred P e p Pie least
were drenched to the skin on a bitterly cold
night, and it wasn’t safe, to ask them whether
they had enjoyed themselves, as they sat shivering

When James Horn was recently brought
up for trial a second time, at Perth (W.A.), on a
charge of criminally assaulting his
he put in a plea, that, having been once tried and
acquitted on a charge, he could not be retried on
the same charge. A jury was empanelled to
decide the plea. Before the jurymen retired,
however, the presiding judge said that, before
they decided whether or not accused had been
acquitted, it was his bounden duty to tell them
that he had been so acquitted ! After retirement,
they tried to dodge between the two halves of
this legal split liair by bringing in a verdict that
accused should be retried; _ but they were
informed by the bench that their opinion wasn’t
wanted on the matter; they were to say whether
or not the man who was acquitted was acquitted,
So they brought in a verdict that the man whom
they knew’was acquitted wasn’t acquitted, and
then business was able to resume.
A Christchurch (M.L.) court has decided
that swearing is justifiable under certain circum-
stances. There had been a bike collision, and
the man run into had sat up in the road and
told the other he might go to a place where the
temperature is considerable. He was sued, and
his counsel explained that cuss words
Were not illegal save by an Act of George 11. which was
not in force in the State ; that the Act provided only
nominal penalties rising from Is. for a common seaman to
ss. for a gentleman, and that, as regards his client’s
remark that the plaintiff could depart into Hades, this
was neither promise, entreaty, demand nor threat, but
merely an unsolicited permission which recipient could
act upon or otherwise at his own discretion.
The Bench cut the matter short by saying it would
probably have sworn itself under like circum-
stances. Case dismissed.

Sydney Sabbath Tipster has started to re-
echo Spruce Myth’s doctrine that it is utterly
wrong to tax the hard-working man who brings
up his family decently, in order to support the
children of the useless loafer who will not support
them properly himself. The Shellback paper
complains that the Sobraon boys are better looked
after than the children of many workers, and yet

The Sabbath organ is always weeping about this
country’s need of population, yet it objects to the
Government taking steps to make the best of the
population that is running to waste, and bringing
it up in a way that will eventually prove remunera-
tive to the State. The country must either pay
to educate its lost children, or pay to bury them,
or pay to gaol them in later life. Which does
the Sunday horror recommend ?

In Wellington (M.L.) the wind is so reliable that
house cleaning is quite simple. You securely
moor anything you wish to keep, and then open
the windows and doors and the rest blows away.
Even a carpet or a bloodstain will blow away if

There is something refreshing about the
resolve of the committee called together to distri-
bute the fund subscribed by the public for blackleg
drivers, firemen and others, that the recipients
are to have medals and chain pendants of uniform
design to remind them of their services, and to
let the public know at whom to throw clods. The
melting value of the trinkets is low, and no man
wants to buy one and pretend he is a blackleg,
and if the owner wears the thing himself he has
to drink his beer all alone, a shunned and solitary
man.

When a prominent man like Leo XIII.
dies, every axe-grinder, political or otherwise,
speeds to paste his advt. on the coffin. The Aus-
tbalian Stab announces John See’s sorrow at the
Pope’s death —it is its business to keep See before
the public. The Telegbaph explains that Car-
ruthers can’t enjoy his food for grief over the
Pope’s death. Humbler papers explain that
Alderman Wobbles, who is standing for re-elec-
tion, is torn by conflicting emotions. Even a
butchers’ organ comes out at such times with the
news that prominent meat salesmen are all broke
up. As for the person who died, he is practically
lost in the scuffle, and his bones are rushed from
pillar to post and trodden under foot in the
advertising scrum, till he might almost as well be
a football.

Rookwood’s happy home for indigent old
men has been under suspicion for a considerable
time, but a few nights ago, in N.S.W. Leg.
Assembly, Andy Kelly produced a lurid verbal
photo.;
The scene at meal times was deplorable. As soon as
the bell rang the men, numbering 400, rushed their living
room like a crowd of madmen, and the weakest were
often knocked down and trampled upon in the wild
scramble, sometimes receiving serious injury.
Assuming this to be true, why is the ungodly
rush 1 Are there not enough victuals, and do
Nos. 398, 399, and 400 go short ? Or are there not
enough seats, and do those who are left have to
wait and dine later upon cold victuals’ Or is
it simply that the dinner rush is the only break
in the deadly, dull, grey monotone of existence—
that it is the one thing that lets the old men know
they aren’t dead ?
Love—The storm. Courtship—The ship-
wreck. Marriage—Taking to the boats. Divorce
—The rescue.
“ Jaf.” . Wonderful the number of land-
scape gardeners running wild in this
country. Fenced in a garden a couple
of months ago and put on an “ expert ”
to lay it out. His method was to make
various little mounds of earth all over
the place and put a seed in each.
Fired him. Another came along.
Had been a sailor. Cut the garden
up into hearts, anchors, etc. —at
least he said they were those
devices. Wasn’t taking any stock
in emblems. A third tramped
into my plot—had been for
“siven years in the satanical
gardins in Shydney.” Showed
him what I wished done. Re-
turned at night to find every
bottle within half-a-mile of
that garden stuck on end
round the beds. I never
knew until then what hard
boozers my neighbors were!
Paid him off on the spot. Land-
scape gardeners are still coming
—and going !

The other day a man got drunk
at Addington (M.L.), and started to
walk along a railway line. If he
had been sober, and remembered that
the Maoriland railways are the dead-
liest in the world, he would not have
done so. Anyway, giving evidence at
the inquest, an engine-cleaner said that,
on the arrival of the train that coincided
with the inebriate, he had noticed blood
on the cowcatcher, but he merely thought
that he had cut his hand. He didn’t exy
amine his hand to see if it had been {cut,
and, in any case, he said he often had to
clean gore and brains and hides off the
cowcatcher. It seems it is so customary for
the Maoriland engines to run over stieep or the
public that the cleaners only get alarmed
when there isn't any blood. During the last
six weeks the cleaners have had to remove off
the cowcatoher the remains of three shunters, one
stationmaster, and four drunks. •'[' '

“P.X.” : Be recent paragraph referring
to fortune-tellers’ popular trick of promising
married women much happiness with a second
husband after the living one is laid to rest.
Remember one will in which the deceased pro-
vided that on the re-marriage of his relict the
money left in trust for her use and benefit was to
be distributed in charity—“ as my wife is certain
of happiness in a second marriage, several clair-
voyants having assured her to that effect, and
consequently will not require any of my money.”
It turned out that, after a domestic row, the
wife had blurted out to the husband what ; the
fortune-tellers had told her—just by way of bring-
ing him to his bearings. She doesn’t consult
fortune-tellers now, and is still unmarried.

He did not know if the jury ever had the miserable

When the infant who’s apprenticed
For a period to a dentist
Gives you greeting and inserts you in the torture-

It’s a lump of consolation
When he lisps in explanation
That he’s just a sort of office-boy who happens to be

When, with confidence precocious.
He puts on a “ holt ” ferocious,
And breaks a solid molar that is aching in your gum,
And he babbles, “ I’ve forgotten

You forgive him—he’s but learning, and you’re very glad

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
_ Sydney, July 28,1903.
Mr Dear Arini,—
Isn’t the Royal Princess asserting herself ! Isn’t
she calling her soul her own, and her person and
actions also, and isn’t she taking all three properties
to furrin ’ parts when her husband or father-in-
law (who is generally named Karl, or Wilhelm, or
Ludwig) hedges her round with forty times more
thou shalt nots ” than there are in the ten com-
mandments, and puts inside those restrictions an
equal number of equally disagreeable “thou
shalts,’ and when, to top the horror, there is his
own German countenance, which she probably
didn’t want to marry, only Papa Franz and
Mama Luise and brother Gottlieb assured her it
would grow on her by-and-bye ?
Cable tells us that the Grand-Duchess of Saxe-
Weimar has run away to Switzerland to escape the
tyranny of her surroundings. What a bad time a
big section of female royalties must have had in
times—not very old times, either—gone by! Women
are not as religious as they used to be, hence their
revolt. So long as Princess Schwartzbrod truly
believed, that God’s eye was on her whilst she was
being grilled, and the more patiently she bore it
the more He loved her, the “tyranny of her
surroundings ” was meekly endured. Other
causes also operated. There was the castle-prison
for the unsubmissive she. Late Prince Albert’s
grandfather kept his Consort cooped up for 30
years. The ancestral endurance of close confine-
ment thus established came in handy for the
Prince Consort later, for Victoria keDt him very
strictly to quarters.
The old plan of insisting on 'their women-folk
being extra religious worked very well indeed—for
the men. “I am proud to say lam an atheist,”
remarked a Spanish grandee to an English
traveller. “ And your wife, does she share your
views ?” “ Great heavens, no,” said the horrified
grandee; “my wife is a respectable woman and
goes to church daily.” But nowadays women
show an inclination to refuse the narcotic of reli-
gionism ; and husbands feel the difference.
A vignette of the girl player or singer’s pro-
fessional debut: A minor hall in the city, a
nicely palm-potted platform with a grand piano
placed slantwise; ushers and ticket-takers who
look like (perhaps are) third year Univer-
sity men; excited relatives and friends of
the debutante making alarms and excur-
sions. At twenty minutes before eight the
audience begins to arrive. Seventy per cent,
of it is young and fresh and feminine, and is
accompanied by its mother. The mother looks as
if Ethel had dragged her away from the washing-
up, rushed her into a black evening dress,
brushed the top of her screwed-up hair, thrown a
woollen shawl on her head, and raced her off to
the city-bound trolly. Ethel herself carries no
suggestion of kitchen or hurried dressing into the
hall. Her Eiffel head carries a big bow, or a
wreath of baby roses; her shoulders and neck
shine under the lamps; she wears a string of
imitation pearls, and a white, pink, or pale-blue
frock, a,nd she sits down near Edith
and begins to comment on the programme,
until her mother discovers that Edith’s mother
is further along the seat and there is a shuffle of
the maternals. Most of the audience personally
know the debutante or know of her, and are kindly
disposed, but its gossip about her, her family, and
her prospects in the profession is jagged because
it is always turning its head suddenly over its
shoulder in expectation of the vice-regal people.
At eight o’clock some critics come in, and, in
spite of the ushers’ entreaties to go up top, slink
into the very hindmost seats. At one minute
past eight enter the graciously-smiling State
Governoress, with daughter. Alice, who glances
round for familiar faces, and an aide who
carries his hands behind him (for fear the
flurried ushers will shake one) and on his face an
I-am-glad-I-carne expression which he assumed
on the footpath. The presentation posies are
accepted and the programme starts. If the
debutante is a player, she leads off with the crash-
bang ; if she is a singer, her white frock, pearls
and voice don’t come on till later. In either
case, the people in the street slacken their pace
as they pass the hall and wonder if it’s a vivi-
section chamber.
Death of Mrs. Lyne, wife of the Home Sec.,
has caused a genuine feeling of sorrow even
amongst people who knew the lady only by
report. The report was always of such a high
character. Mrs. Lyne was of a charitable and
unaffected nature. After her husband was
beti tied a damsel from a daily paper called upon her
for a portrait and an interview. “Stay to lunch,”
said the Home Sec.’s wife, “and never mind
the portrait or the monograph. The last wouldn’t
interest anyone, and as for the first—well, I’ve
only had one, and that was taken some 25 years
ago—a ‘tinograph ’ I think, at a picnic.” Mrs.
Lyne succumbed to pneumonia following on
influenza. Her family consisted of three daugh-
ters and one son.
Any unmarried who wishes for a matrimonial
mate has only to take a fairly protracted sea
voyage in order to become Mrs. at the end of it.
The husband seems a kind of marine product,
so often is he to be found at sea. Most
Sydney-siders will recollect a classic-faced
beauty whose lusciousness of late years
threatened to perish in the overblowing. She left
for a trip to S’Africa some months ago, and now
report says that she is fiancee. Met him on the
voyage. Aud there’s—anyone of you can easily
recollect half-a-dozen acquaintances who went to
sea and had a catch.
Aucklander Tom Manders Jackson is, I see,
about to return to Maoriland, and take up the
auctioneering business which he left some ten.
years ago for the lyric stage. He has been some
eight years in London, and always seemed to have
good engagements. He certainly has, or had, a.
beautiful voice. So perhaps climatio reasons
Ada Crossleyis generous with her star voice! She
sang six songs at inaugural reception of recently-
founded Austral Club. Many of her old Mel-
bourne friends are in some way interested in the
bantling. The Browne sisters —Hirst and Myra—
and Nellie Veitch were to the fore, and Mrs.
Alfred Ibbotson. Most of the other clubites are
the Countess This or My Lady That.
Didn’t somebody say that all mankind loves
a lover? Suppose that’s why a section of the
’kind is constantly manufacturing engagements.
It wants to gloat over the “ lovers ” who
probably have only a how-d’ye-doing acquaint*
ance. However, five warship men are truly 1
engaged to Sydney girls, and there is more thao
a rumor of an engagement between two Sydney
musicians. He’s a widower—she’s a widow. And
both are very good looking.
Freemasons put up a record for brilliancy and
attendance at their last annual ball. The State
Ex., by the way, promptly sent along his annual
sub. of five guineas. His annual fivers to various
charities are fairly numerous. Both Governors.
(General and Particular) were present, and
amongst the guests brought by the Governor-
General was Mrs. Harmer, wife of the Bishop of
Adelaide. A real lilac spray is Mrs. Harmer,
very pretty and fair. Bishops usually have such
square wives with a look of solid sense below
their plainly-brushed hair. Brother A. J. Bcott
hon. sec’d the ball, and he must have worn &
smile like an earthquake fissure when (with the
packed galleries) he beheld a £4OO or so house.
Proceeds go to the Freemasons’ Benevolent Insti-
tution. Distressed or infirm Freemasons, their
wives or widows, have small pensions from the
institution, which is only one of the F.’s several
charity organisations, and all have about them
the unusual point that, outside a small commit-
tee, none know to whom the charity is dispensed.
When Mrs. Fitzclarence, of Darling Point, gets
cards for a free musical show, she generally gives
them to her housemaid, who takes the coachman.
If the housemaid has a prior engagement she
gives the cards to brother Bill’s landlady—and of
such is the audience of a free musical show in
Sydney. But the crowd that filled Centenary
Hall at invitation of the Henry M. Birge Pianola
Co. to listen to the first performance in Sydney of
Lisa Lehmann’s “Persian Garden” last Thursday
was an exception to the rule. The Fitzclarences
came in force, and the audience’s names, if printed,
would be a yard of the Government House list.
By the way it buried its face in the programme
(all the verses of the song cycle were printed) old
Omar must have been for it a new writer. Com-
poser L.L. has got considerable blood and wine
and fire and roses and nightingales into the music
that breathes over that eastern garden. Misses
Violet Mount and Maud Dalrymple, and Messrs.
Robyns and Weir did the Gardening with
Persian languorousness, and Mr Adams operated
the Pianola which played the pianoforte accom-
paniments. “In a Persian Garden” will be
repeated to-night (Thursday).
Death of Mr. Quong Tart, the merchant from
Loch China, will be a sad loss, not only to his own
young family of six children, but to the charity
organisations of Sydney. He was a cheerful
giver. Mrs. Quong Tart, who was a bookkeeper
in one of the big establishments he owned in
Sydney some years ago, is an Australian, and is
still a very fine looking woman.
The new Her Majesty’s Theatre leaves a color
memory of sapphire velvet, old gold, dull silver,
and various tints of soft greens and greys. At
the auction of seats for opening night, “ Colonel ”
J. P. Smith, a.n American oil spring owner, who
has been living in Sydney for some time,
bought the first four put up for £l2 each,
and handed up the money in notes. This gentle-
man is he who takes a seat for his hat at a theatre
and a passage for it on our railways. A free-born
’Murkan’s hat is worth first-class accommodation
anywhere.
The moaning of the tied was to be heard at
N.S.W. Kennel Club show, last week—said to be
the best of the club’s shows up to date. There
was the usual display of caninolatry—men
and women who stood near the pets all day
and brushed them every few minutes. Women
exhibitors must make the committee very mad
sometimes. One lady who was showing a pair of
valuable small dogs took them out of their boxes
and tucked them under her arms, and so toured
around behind the vice-regal party. The Rawsons
are very doggy, and Miss Alice’s Australian ter-
riers—low-comedian-looking dogs—are having the
day that every dog is said to enjoy some time in
his life. I see by a foreign exchange that some
scientist has been experimenting with dogs to
learn if they are capable of reasoning, and his
verdict is that they are not. Don’t think any
of us believe a dog is capable of playing
chess—that requires close reasoning; or of
giving a new reading of Hamlet’s “Solilo-
quies.” But if his food is hot he will lie down
and wait quietly for it to cool. That proves some
reasoning faculty. I had a dog who used to lift
the heavy earthenware cover off a jar to steal bis-
cuits. He would only do it when he thought he
was unobserved, and no amount of coaxing would
induce him to do it as a trick. He pretended he
didn’t know how. And after the steal he didn’t
know enough to re-cover the jar. I thought he
showed some reason once in stopping a runaway
horse. The pony started for home by a long high-
road and the dog (he was a big Newfoundland)
went in pursuit, but suddenly ran off at a right
angle, took a short cut over two paddocks, jumped
several fences, and bailed up the moke (who was
a stable friend of his). When he was a puppy
I. used to punish him by boxing his ears with
his own fore paws. One day when he was a
biggish dog he killed my ’possum, and I was
so mad I looked for a club wherewith to wallop
him. He was abjectly frightened, and backed
away whimpering ; then, thinking there was no
escape from the wrath to come, sought to depre-
cate it by standing on his hind legs and boxing
his ears with his paws. I think the picked dog
can reason—some.
One of the clever Geach girls—sisters to our
Edwin (who will be back here in September)—has
opened an American hat shop in Sydney, Panamas
S'.ncipally, with a side show of round hairy ones
e Tam o’ Shanters. Another Geach sister has
gone up to Panama-hat the Brisbaneites, and a
third is doing the like for Adelaide folk.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Miss Ivy Deakin (daughter of the Australian
Attorney-General), who has been helping suburban
charity theatricals, is a tall, willowy damsel, given
to binding her tawny locks with a classic chaplet of
green leaves, Ala Melba. Her clever violin play-
ing hints at inherited ability, and there’s some-
thing of pa’s oratorical demeanor, too, in his
daughter’s acting deportment—a way of shak-
ing herself from the hips upwards in moments of
would-be emphasis.
“The M'Eacharns have been entertaining
Count Vay de Vaya at their Kew mansion.
They re addicted to distinguished foreigners and
lions of various species—especially the learned
variety. The M'Eacharn’s liege-lady writes
‘ papers ’ on Japan and his daughter is strong on
Woman s Rights, so he is well within the truth
when he says, as he is fond of doing, ‘ we’re not
all Goths at Goathlands ’I ‘ Lion-hunting ’ and
culchaw and all that sort of thing have their social
uses. Once upon a time the Cliveden dame had a
gift in that direction. In her early married life
there generally used to be a lonely little Jap of
distinguished parentage or a gloomy Spaniard of
diplomatic influence enjoying Rupertswood hospi-
tality.
, The marriage of Justice Hodges’ daughter
™ Majah Brown passed off quietly enough.
The bride had some wonderful presentation lace
to enhance her sacrificial outfit, and a tall
Elizabethan collar to make for queenliness. The
effect was novel. The weight of the toilette, al-
though two children toyed with the five-yard-long
tram, must have induced her extreme pallor, for
the.two Hodges sisters have been much envied for
their rose-freshness. The maids supplied a quaint
group. Large blue-and-white hats with curling
Gainsborough rims and plumes harmonised with
loose scarfs of blue, draped from the floral staff,
round the rear, to the disengaged hand. With
their white frocks and deep sloping yokes of lace
they looked like the gallery types of Marcus
Stones maidens. Surgeon Fitzgerald’s second
daughter was, perhaps, the sweetest of the bevy.
After years of delicate health she has at last de-
veloped into a beauty with a rather wistful plea
in her fine eyes.
The family of Major Clifton Brown (how
effective is Clifton just there !) are described as
very wealthy, and Toorak fervently talks over
the trifling cheque, running into five figures,
sent by his Colonel dad to mark the marriage.
This, says Toorak, is merely ‘a something to go
on with.’ The couple honeymoon at ‘ New-
mmster ’ —the homestead of the soldier-son of
‘Cliveden.’
“An advance Spring fashion appeared at a
recent wedding—a tulle veil drawn over to the
back of a picture hat, and brought round again to
form a large soft bow with ends under the chin.
11 s a dainty, Dolly Varden, demure fashion that
should go with a plump figure, a short skirt, and
a mole. For the present most fashionables con-
tent themselves with an expensive grey and white
double net of. tulle and chiffon that throws the
pink and white, or its color-scheme substitute,
into charming relief.
Janet Lady Clarke must have lately caught
the eye of Mr. David Syme and smiled her newest
Pans smile at that not very susceptible potentate.
The Age now serves as a Melbourne Court
chronicle of the sprightly Dowager’s career. Her
name fills a ‘ star ’ position in the paper, and the
attention of the local world is particularly directed
to the fact that ‘ Janet Lady Clarke and party
arnved at Deniliquin on Thursday night. They
left for Thule Station yesterday on a short visit,’
and so forth. One expects to find Janetlady’s
sojourn at the station recorded under the fanciful
heading of ‘ The Princess of Thule.’
" At the Princess, the ‘ Serenade ’suffered from
dull business in its first week, thanks, partly to the
Serenade ’ itself; partly to lack of personal
charm on the part of the principals. Mdme. Slap.,
sound singer though she is, should be bound over to
solid opera, where she scores by her vocal merits.
In lighter work, her stage- 1 business ’ is quite
pathetic. In boy’s dress, edifying the monks with
display of ‘the way we dance in Andalusia,’ she
prances rather than danoes, and all through,
instead of flitting like a saucy wren, she struts
and curvets like an emu. May Beatty, in page
attire, is also none too sparkling a revelation,
as to either matter or manner. Piddock is deco-
rative enough, but local damsels, somehow, seem
lukewarm. Too much has been printed, inethinks,
re the showy baritone’s ‘ charming wife and sweet
little children ! ’ Lempriere Pringle, now, does
interest she-opera-goers a bit, but, in the ‘ Sere-
nade,’ he has a thoroughly platonic part—no open-
ing at all for airing his Romeo methods !
“The ‘Serenade’ has a piquant scene with a
monkery on one side of a wall and a nunnery on
the other. In East Melbourne, the Presbyscotch
Ladies College is separated only by the breadth
of a street from the Christian Brothers, but com-
munication, even a glance, was scotched—nay
more—killed, ldng, long ago. To the Christian
Brethren s credit, they never did waste many
glances on the Scotch sistern, but the latter were
interested in their gowned neighbors and made
no secret of it. One day the school was assembled
and the stern Principal, his face firm as Scotch
granite, announced in awful tones, ‘ I have just
had a visit from the Rev. Father Z.’ (Everyone
knew what was coming and inwardly called upon a
far-away mother to come and snatch her from the
wrath to come.) According to Father Z., the
pngs next-door had been ‘pained and shocked ’
to the last degree—had declined, in fact, to take
exercise in their grounds, so embarrassed were
they by the she-scrutiny from the college’s up-
stair windows. At this stage of the address there
was an angry swish of ‘ pigtails ’ as every girl in
the room, including the meekest, fiercely tossed
her head and mentally swore off, henceforward
and for ever more, looking on the same side of the
road as a Christian brother.
“ Prof. Peterson has pulled round slowly. He
looked washy the other night, though a full house
welcomed the Conservatorium concert and all
went well. Probably he wouldn’t be half as well
as he is were it not for his clever wife—plucky
strong-hearted, and zealous for the Peterson
prestige. The Professor’s illness, however, has
affected her spirits. A year or two ago Mrs.
Peterson was a bright, sparkling, quizzical soul.
JNow she is staid and quiet and just a little sad.
Agnes Thorn, the star of the Peterson
Conservatorium, is a very capable performer—
and one of many gifts. Her piano playing is as
good as her vocalism, and neither is as promising
as her turn of histrionics.
“ At ‘ Stonington ’ scraps of news are circulated
as to Miss Clarke’s trip abroad. The latest tell
of brilliant jaunts and swagger shivoos under
Melba’s- wide wing. Lady Silverlocks glows at
the very mention of the diva’s name, and to all
who stood by that dominant dame when scandal
was at its height, the Vice-Regals show unstinted
gratitude. It was whispered that a current Aide
last summer suggested caution in regard to
booming and haloing Melba at ‘Stonington,’ but
the head of the house retorted with a stinging
censure. Miss Mignonette Clarke does not start
with Marchesi until Melba is prepared to hie to
Paris, too.
“The eldest hope of the Pursey Chirnsides last
month was cast for one of the train-bearers at the
wedding of Miss Clarke (daughter of the late
Agent-General for the State) in the Big Smoke.
Many Victorians were present, and Miss Nora
Dane—the big, handsome graduate of the Marshall
Hall Conservatorium—helped the tone of things
with the bridal chant from ‘Lohengrin.’ This
bride flourished all her diamonds—among them a
costly tiara. Simplicity in nuptial garments is
going out. The London brides depart from pearls
and lilies-of-the-valley and orange blossom and go
in for an array of gems and exotics. When sim-
plicity is vanishing from the feminine character it
may as well take its characteristic garments

“ Brighton is a suburb that’s to be respected.
Its bachelors took heart of grace the other day
and issued cards for a ball. In other districts the
tired mothers who are, year in and year out,
pushing ahead bread-and-butter dances, or house
to house parties, are only too grateful if the young
Gussies of their circle casually drop into the whirl
and honor a few of the freshest girls with polka
partnership. A bachelor’s hop is a perfect
wonder. I can almost forgive Brighton its Bent.
“Chief Commissioner Tait’s fair mate is pre-
pared to buckle on the Social armor. Society has
called in battalions on her at the ‘Grand.’ Mrs.
Tait is much younger than her greying lord, and
has all the light conversational froth that generally
characterises the pale gold-haired. There is a
family of one, a youthful daughter.
“A barrister son of Pastor Fitchett married
the other day Mrs. Maynard—a youthful and
very attractive widow. Once more mixed religions
had to be reconciled, and Melbourne witnessed in
surprise one of the Methodist Fitchetts being
harnessed according to the Roman Catholic rules.
Several mixed matches have occurred recently,
and Dr. Carr, at St. Patrick’s, makes his consent
less cordial every time. Sermons are hurled at
the heads of the R.C. congregations constantly,
but without avail. What is wanted is an arrest
of Bridget’s tendency to grow superior to Mike.
“ Great joy in the ranks of science over the
appointment of the hard-working Prof. Martin to
the directorship of the Jenner Institute for Pre-
ventive Medicine. He has long mourned his
restrictions in research, and his helplessness to
advance experimental work ‘through lack of the
very necessary appointments to the Laboratory
here. All scientists lose hope and see their
enthusiasms wane in a State that looks scofflngly
on higher education and runs things generally oil
Bent principles. So the joy of Prof. Martin at
getting a chance elsewhere is shared by sympa-
thisers, who understood how limited was his
scope up at the ‘Shop.’ Even the Melbourne
Board of Health is so badly stocked with instru-
ments that the dootors have to improvise vaccina-
tion needles.
“The first of the novel afternoon rallies, pro--
moted by Mrs. York Syme to aid womankind to
cut her political wisdom tooth, is timed for this
Monday (27th) at Balwyn. Several Federalists
are billed to enlighten the feminine understand-
ing. Like her plump brother—Yes-No George—
Mrs. Syme likes to be moving in a public radius.
For years she has mothered a dozen deserving
charities. They say one Senator has been taking
elocution lessons to witch the ears of the voting
womankind at these cake-and-talk rallies.
“Rep. Crouch, who proposed a Federal Go-as-
you-please, and was tipped to win by a little more
than a perspiration bead, is sadly disappointed
that his suggestion didn’t go. He fought for'it
vigorously, but in a Parliament where the average
age of members is 50 the harrier sprint found few
sympathisers.
“Bishop Clarke and his daughters attended the
Senate galleries last week, under the pilotage of
Mrs. Chairman Best. He had been promised a
treat in oratory, but Mr. O’Connor plugged away
unemotionally on the subject of sugar bounties.
The same afternoon one giddy member of the
Senate had four relays of lady friends, and the
neglected gallants of the House could only grin in
a spirit of covetousness.
A season or two ago two smart sisters-in-law
—Mrs. Pursey and Mrs. George Chirusido—wefe
rival contestants in the chiffon competition.
Society was amused and interested. Then
London ‘ called,’ and off went one after the other
to the Big Smoke. Now two other sisters-in-law
—Mrs. Arthur Payne and Mrs. T. H. Payne-
lead m the cake-walk. They rustle much toge-
ther and consort cheerily, thus robbing the com-
petition of much of its snap. :
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Governor Le Hunte, of S.A., has a grand-
nephew of Nelson for private secretary.
Treasonable lines from recent Brisbane
Telegraph leader:
England’s monarchical line bears so many bars sinister
that it is hardly politic to recall the genealogy.
The strong man of an Australian State
Ministry made his first rise some 20 years back
by engineering a three-card and “ Yankee sweat”
table on a bakblox racecourse.
Some latter-day female names picked from
a list of a couple of dozen appearing in connection
with a fair at a swell suburb of Sydney : Be,
Dick, Bebe, Cecile, Fearon and Billetta.
The still youthful-looking Alfred Deakin
has worn wig and gown for over a quarter of a
century. He has been an off and on journalist a
little longer, and a politician a little longer still.
Cardinal Cullen, Cardinal Moran’s uncle,
was too late to vote for a successor to Pius IX.
Cardinal Moran is certain to be late for the elec-
tion of a successor to Leo XIII. The habit of
being late is in the family.
Short as was the stay in Sydney of novelist
W. E. Norris, a large number of insufficiently
stamped packets of manuscript from city and
suburbs found him out. Only his opinion “as an
impartial judge” was solicited.
Died at Ashfield, Sydney, lrtst Sunday,
Mandarin Quong Tart, aged 53. Quong Tart was
something of a public character years ago, but of
late he dropped a good deal out of notice, and
became an ordinary business citizen.
Justice Cohen, President of N.S.W. Arbi-
tration Court, carried through his law course from
start to finish in three years. Before setting out
for London in pursuit of a call to the Bar he and
his brother ran a haberdashery at Maitland.
Late Sydney brewer J. T. Tooliey, out of
£275,000, left only £9OO to charities—and that
exclusively to R.C. institutions. It was a poor,
contribution to relieving the poverty and distress
which the making of a quarter of a million in beer
inevitably causes.
N.S. VV.’s Nosey Bob, who scragged a
pair the other day, always rises to a big
job. A single hanging doesn’t stir his professional
instincts. “We can accommodate four a time
comfortably,” he remarked lately, “at Darling-
hurst.” “The new gallows,” said chaplain
Bedford in the early days, “ takes seven comfort-
ably—but eight would be a bit crowded.”
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN STATE-
SCHOOLS.—HERETIC DRILL.
SENATOR FRASER (speaking air; inst Rome at recent
Orange meeting): “ A great responsibility rested on
parents in this and all lands in regard to the rearing of
their offspring. He was sorry to say that in Australia
they did not pay sufficient attention to these matters.”
Queensland Minister Leahy, who has ex-
pressed a determination to put down drinking in
the Civil Service, made the foundation of his
fortune as a Western publican. Now, having
made his own pile, he doesn’t care what becomes
of the next publican.
The irrepressible Smith. At the meeting
of the Riverina branch of the Australian Workers’
Union, held lately v at St. Arnaud, a local commit-
tee was appointed, consisting of J. Smith, S.
Smith, R. Smith, Joseph Smith, W. Smith, and
three others not Smith.
At an inspection of a M.L. Volunteer
corps General Babington put a few questions to a
tire 1-looking swaddie, the last one being a poser.
“ Vou’ve got ren beat, General,” said the trooper,
with a we try smile, and his mates sniggered.
“Babs” glared and passed on.
The familiar face of Adelaide’s leading
paper boy, George, was lately missing for some
days, and the following notice hung on the post
where he was accustomed to howl his wares :
“ George is ill in bed. Won’t be here for a few
days. Society papers please copy.”
Little Chief Justice Way, of S.A., has
played Governor 25 times. He first went into the
business 20 years ago, after Sir Anthony Mus-
grave retired and before his successor, Cairns’s,
arrival. His last “turn” was the longest of all,
lasting 12 months less only a fortnight.
Five out of the seven minor court Judges
of New South Wales have, on occasion, acted as
Justices of the Supreme Court. In fact the
“acting” business has reached such a point that
the State might almost as well dispense with
Judges and let the barristers “ act ” turn about.
Many slanders were uttered about Henry
Parkes before and after his death, but none more
villainous than that put forth recently by Zion
Elijah Dowie, that the old Parliamentary hand
offered him, the said Dowie, the portfolio of
Public Instruction, at the same time guarantee-
ing him a safe seat in Parliament. And Dowie
refused!
The evils of popularity! In a N.S.W.
mining town is a tin-buyer—a man always helping
his poorer brethren in different ways. He has put
up for the Assembly once or twice and been
beaten because his friends voted solidly against
him. As one elector puts it: “ Who’d we go to
to borrow a fiver from if he wuz down at Sydney in
tlie blessed Parlyment ? ”
Dr. Angel Money’s house in Macquarie-
street, Sydney, is advertised for sale. It has been
an unlucky place. Dr. Harman Tarrant, for mat y
years its tenant, stumbled and came to griet,
quackery and an unhappy death. Then Dr.
Angel Money —for many years one of the city’s
leading physicians—broke down utterly from over-
work. ° The house will probably be pulled down
now and the site used for a big boarding-house or
a nest of “ fiats.”
Braddon of the Blot, ordinarily so tame
and courteous, was thirty years ago known in
India as the King of Tiger-slayers.
Reynolds’ says that the Princelet of
Wales is constantly under doctor’s orders, and
has been prescribed another long sea-voyage—to
India this time—for the good of his health.
“lam quite willing to give you a couple
of columns’ talk,” said the M.L.A. to the news-
paper interviewer, “ but I’ll want payment.
“But,” said the interviewer, “the adver-
tisement of the thing counts.” “ I have
my own ways of advertising myself,
and don’t need to enlarge them.”
The interviewer returned later and
said, “We’ll introduce the article
with the statement that your
popularity and assured position
in the front rank of politicians
make your opinions of the highest
public value.” M.L.A. suc-
cumbed.
Little Justice Holroyd, now
senior Yic. puisne Judge, regu-
larly every morning has a boxing bout for his
health’s sake with his son Spencer. The latter
is the old man’s associate in court, and some-
times raises the dander of “the Bench” by not
being visible at the exact moment he is wanted.
When this occurs the legal element winks and
predicts that his Honor will hit out hard at
Spencer when he puts on the gloves next morning.
His Honor is said to punch like a demon when his
blood is up.
R. L. J. Ellery, who for two generations was
Government Astronomer and Official yVeather'Pro-
phet at Melbourne, was the first medical man who
attended John Price when he was fatally injured
by the convicts at Williamstown. The old
flogging days look as if they were hull down on
the foggy horizon of antiquity, but they only
belong to yesterday, after all.
Bishop Frodshain (Anglican), of N.Q.,
who is now taking the plate round Australia to
get coin to repair the ravages of the cyclone in his
diocese, is a handsome, clean-shaven young man,
who, in any crowd of R.C.’s, would pass for one of
them. To add to the resemblance, he wears, like
a Roman bishop, a huge amethyst ring and a
purple “ dickie. ” The reason why a Roman
bishop wears a bit of purple where the Anglican
man sports white is, it has been stated on unre-
liable authority, that the Roman is mostly a
bachelor, and purple doesn’t need to be “done
up” so often in the laundry. To a bachelor, the
laundry question is a great one.
In a certain Australian State lives a man
related to a political joss. This man might be
called Jones, though he isn’t. It was Jones who
rushed to the edge of the wharf, when
the boat was approaching, and sang out,
“ Hurrah ! boys, the drought has broke ;
there ’as been an electoral disturbance all
over Australia.” One of . Jones’s weak-
nesses was teaching his family the.following
parrot rhyme: “I am Mr. Bill Jones,
Esq., J.P., coroner, Mayor of Mudbank-
ville, brother to the almighty politician
Thomas Jones, brother to the Mayor of
Buncoville, and monarch of all I survey.”
This went on for some time, and when
any member of the family misbehaved,
he was placed in a corner and made to re-
peat the story to his indignant father. At
last, the eldest of the family went out
into the world and received his first
lesson in the relative sizes of things.
One day, he “ crossed ” the paternal one,
and was called to the corner to purge
himself of the offence. “Who am I?”
thundered Jones, lookingfiercely at his
offspring. There was silence for a moment
and the son replied: “A great damphool,
father, and the only idiot in Mudbankvdle
as doesn’t know it! ” Then the roars of father
Jones could have been heard half-a-mile off as he
shouted for blood.
Mr. William Pritchard, an old Sydney
identity, died at Burwood recently, aged 74 years.
M any years ago, while seeking election to the
City Council, annoyed at interruptions, he said
that if he had his way he would poll tax every
Irishman that came to Australia. That expres-
sion lost him the election. Dan O’Connor, how-
ever, was his life-long friend. They were once
in a pork butchery together.
J. Alexander, a Scotchman, who has just
retired (on reaching 70) from the E.S. and A
Bank in Mount Gambier (S.A), told some in-
teresting yarns to a big meeting that farewelled
him. Alexander was banking in Chicago during
the Secession war, when it was an untidy little place
of 75,000 people. In the sixties he established
branches of the Standard Bank all over South
Africa, and was then taken with the diamond
fever, holding a claim right in the middle of what
is now Kimberley. Here l.e struck a boulder,
about the size of a baby mountain, which he had
not the means to remove, so he sold out to Cecil
Rhodes, who afterwards took £lOO,OOO worth of
stones out of that claim. For the last 30 years
Alexander has been managing country banks in
S.A., and for the last 20 he has been at Mfc.
Gambier, where he proposes to end his days.
QUITE RESTFUL.
“If Labor would only shake off that false old notion
that wealth employs labor and realise that labor works
for labor the country would soon prosper.” —Brilliant
hunk from Age article against Socialism.
“ Well, Jim,! if we weren't doing it for ourselves
I'd reckon it work.”
The Age again clubs its Joss :
With the exception of Graham Berry, Victorian
politicians have been entirely lacking in Chat attractive
force without which leadership is a very short-lived
affair. Not one of the political leaders of the day
possesses it. Mr. Irvine, for instance, who came into
power on the crest of a wave of popular feeling, stands
only temporarily at the head of the Reform party, for not
even his most ardent admirers will credit him with being
adequately equipped for leadership.
When the late Pope took the title in 1878
it was commonly remarked that the cardinals had
chosen a very aged and physically fragile man for
the distinction in order that others among them
might have a chance of taking their turns in the
Chair. Nobody thought of Leo XIII. becoming
a great institution a quarter of a century ahead—
except the insurance companies which speculated
in Pontifical life policies.
Sydney University is in mourning over
the death of F. W. Lloyd, universally known as
“Tommy Lloyd,” lecturer in Latin. Though
born in U.S.A. Lloyd was educated at Sydney
Grammar School and entered the University in
1877. He graduated in 1890 with the University
gold medal, and became in succession master to
his old school and lecturer to his old faculty. He
was only 35 at the time of his death, and his mar-
riage had been set down for August 22.
Chief Justice Way (S.A.) has a habit of
cracking small jokelets on the Bench, often when
a counsel is in the middle of his address or cross-
examination. Juniors, as a rule, smile or laugh
obsequiously as the size of the joke apparently
demands. Symon waits, witli an unsmiling face,
until the chief has finished his wild burst of
humor, and then continues. Nesbit once went
one better. He waited until the “little man”
got through, and then remarked, quietly : “I—
er—suppose we laugh here, your Honor?” Every-
one did laugh except Way.
“J.”: Apropos father and son contem-
porary pensioners (8., 16/7/ 03). The late John
Cecil Read, of Darlinghurst Gaol, and his son
William Vero Read, of the N.S.W. railways,
were pensioners on the same list. J. C. Read re-
tired in 1889 on £372 per annum (now dead); the
son retired on March 1, 1890, on £546 per annum
(still living). There is an alleged baronetcy in
the Read family, but the last to use thi *itle
was the present W. V. Read’s grandfather.
Whitaker’s Peerage speaks scornfully of the
baronetcy, and says it became extinct in 1711.
Premier Barton fought for the Naval
Tribute Bill as he never before in his life fought
for a principle or a policy. He threatened to take
any amendment as a vote of censure, and went so
far as to use as an argument the statement that
Captain Cresswell—our local expert on naval
matters and the champion of an Australian navy—
had approved of the Tribute Bill, a statement
which he had to afterwards withdraw as utterly
incorrect. Australia’s Nobbled Son only aroused
himself from a long torpor to bargain away the
Commonwealth’s best interests to Chamberlain.
Policeman John Johnston, orderly at Wel-
lington (M.L.) magistrate’s court, shot himself
dead, at the police court, a fortnight ago. John-
ston was the man who, a few years back, boarded
a Yankee barque at the Wellington wharf, and,
single-handed, arrested one of the crew who was
shooting his mates promiscuously on the deck.
The shooter had a loaded revolver in his hand
when the policeman looked him in the eye and
Slid, “You’re my prisoner.” For this act of
ridiculous bravery, Johnston was given an extra
6d. a day and made court orderly, and his arrestee
was given 10 years. The jury opined that the big
man was temporarily insane with the usual tem-
porary insanity of coroners’ juries, but his friends
know that it was just indigestion that made him
kill himself. The indigestion horror is sufficient
explanation of anything, and why a jury should
go out of its way to tell a conventional lie in a
case where the truth is so much more convincing
no one knows.
A Mohammedan interpreter, in the Ade-
laide police court the other day, blocked the pro- /
ceedings by absolutely’ refusing to translate a bad
word which had been used bv a colored brother.
It was against his religion, he said, and he
wouldn’t repeat it for anything. The point being
of some importance, as an insult inviting an
assault in return, counsel'gave him a lead over.
“Was it —— ?’ 1 said Paris Nesbit, and the inter
prefer, in his haste to agree, said “Yes, it was ——’’
After which he mournfully assured the court, that
it was the first time he had ever used the word—
“ and I have been in these courts for 14 years. ”
“ Jeroug ” writes : .-■<
So far as my knowledge is concerned of the late James :
Torpy and the stirring times at Lambing Flat (whiefr
knowledge dates from the first riots that took place
against the Chows at Stony Creek in December, 1860), I
never knew Mr. Torpy to do any digging on the Flat.
Many were aware he sold a claim on the Turon to the
Chows for a tidy sum. lam not aware of his taking pairt ■
in any of the proceedings on the visit of the then Colonial
Secretary, Charley Oowper, who came and held meetings,
on Spring and Stony Creeks, and settled a plough-line ,
boundary from Back Creek to Blackguard Gully, over
which the Chows were not to trespass. The Chows ig-
nored the plough-line and encroached over. Result:
Second big roll-up on the 30th June, 1861, that wiped
them off the Flat. The attack on the camp took place on-,
the 14th July, same year, and moved from Torpy’s Hotel,
Tipperary Gully. Spicer, Cameron and Stewart were the
leaders. Never knew Torpy as an agitator, or to make a
speech until he and Baker returned from Sydney. Torpy
and Baker (one a publican, the other keeper of a Temper-
ance Caf6) were selected by the diggers to lay their griev-
ance before the Governor (John Young), hut he refused to
see them. Excitement ran high with the Sydney people
over the Governor’s action, and Torpy was invited to
address a meeting in the School of Arts. The police
apprehended Torpy on a bogus warrant. Bennett, of
Hanson and Bennett, who owned the Empire of those '
days (not Parkes), came to the aid of Torpy. The authori-
ties refused bail for Torpy. Bennett demanded it, if it.
went to the amount of £50,000. Torpy was liberated, ,
and the affair hushed up. David Buchanan asked in the
Assembly for the production of the sworn testimony oh
which the warrant was issued, but he had no
save Moffit, the Blue Nose solicitor. Parkes never by
word or deed showed any sympathy for the diggers.
Torpy and Baker gained notoriety over the affair, which
helped them politically in after years. The Empire stuck
to the diggers manfully ; the S.M. Herald and Melbourne
Argus were continually sooling the Government on ta
reinstate the Chows.
Tired of waiting for Snow to electrify the
Adelaide trams, the city council has appointed A
committee to inquire if something cannot be done
in the way of motor omnibuses. Young Bonython
has the matter in hand, so presumably pa’s paper,
is at the back of him. But, if pa’s paper had done
its duty in the past, Snow would not have blocked
the way to the improvement of the tram system. .
A TRIFLE.
“Mr. Glassev (Q.) presented a petition with four signa-
tures from the'Brisbane Chamber of Commerce against,
the anti-black labor clause of the Postal Act.”
Premier Barton only got the Naval Tribute
Bill through the House of Reps, by energetic
cracking of the party whip. He threatened
resignation if the Bill were rejected or amended,
and, as that meant losing Kingston, Turner,
Deakin and O’Connor and replacing them with
Heaven knows whom, some members were doubt-
less influenced by the threat. If the opponei ts
of the measure had made a strong demonstration
against it on the Address-in-Reply, there would
have been a better chance of delaying the con-
clusion of the Tribute agreement until public
opinion had been awakened to the nature of its
betrayal of Australian interests. The Australian
party in the Senate will probably put up a strong
fight, and there is yet a remote hope of rejection
or modification.
DEBILITY.
You’re a victim to debility!
You haven’t a pint of pure blood in your body.
You’ve got no appetite and you've got no energy.
You can’t sleep and you can’t eat. You’re pale-faced and head-achy.
Debility means Death.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills banish debility—always.
This is how they do it: .
First, they purify the blood. Then they make rich red blood, filling the veins with healthy red corpuscles.
And they brace up the nerves. . ~, c ,
This new active blood sharpens the appetite, strengthens the digestion, fills out the frame, strengthens the
backbone—induces sound satisfying sleep, tireless energy, and perfect health. Then there s no Debility .

Werrunee :Re flying foxes (B. 1 17/ ).
There are about 30 species of bats m Australia,
all but half a dozen being insect eaters. Ui the
fruit eaters (foxes or kalongs) the best known are
the Great Grey-Headed, the Spectacled and the
Kngfox‘(Pteropuspofiocephalufj, is found in
vast colonies throughout the coastal districts of
\TRW This is the hated, foetid orchard des-
1 fi. Ir. dwdnew narlm and
poller, often seen hanging Y Y P . ...
gardens. Ihe Spectacled k along (U. conspicilia-
lus) belongs to Fitzroy Islands and the North
Coast. It has formidable teeth, and pretty
circular bands of yellow, or orange-colored, fur
round the eyes and shoulders. The Funeieal
kalong (P. funereus), of N.Q. and Malay Archi-
pelago is very dark, and feeds mostly on blossoms.
Others are the Cape York kalong (P. scapulatus),
and the Dwarf kalong (Petalia), of N.E. coast.
“ Chasselas ” supplies more fox and bunny
theories:—
Re foxes killing lambs (Bulletin 16,'7/’03): “ Oumbo *
is wrong in his description of the way a fox deals with a
lamb. Reynard is an artist at the biz. He makes a small
hole close to the last rib, sucks the blood, and gets the
heart, liver and caul fat. Never knew any other animal
to treat its prey in this fashion except a half-bred dingo
up Wimmera (Vic.) way. Most sheep-slayers get to the
throat and legs. The fox does not kill as many lambs as
he gets credit for. He prefers young rabbits, and when
he finds a closed burrow he scratches a hole right over
the nest and hits the mark every time.
* * * *
The first fox heard of in the Paroo
(N.S.W.) district was killed at Goorimpa a few
days ago. Reynard, like bunny, marches north.

“Wilgar”: Accounts of recent trip
through the Vic. Mallee make me suspect that
the “magnificent natural resources of this great
country” wouldn’t support a suburb, let alone a
nation. Lascelles, of Tyrrell Downs, applying
for an extension of his lease, said that he had
cleared the land (at a cost of 10s. 9d. per acre) for
his tenants ; erected a vermin-proof fence round
the whole cultivated area ; advanced seed, fodder,
meat and other provisions (money payable after
harvest) the first year; and in most cases, for
three out of the six years, got no returns at all.
His third-share, in one exceptionally good
instance, panned out like this: Ist harvest, nil:
2nd, 3 bushels an acre ; 3rd, 4 bushels ; 4th, l£
bushels ; sth, nil; 6th, nil; or, for the six seasons,
1000 bags off 1800 acres cultivated ! In the
Waitchie country, across the boundary, there
were, last year, 200 families, now there are 20—
and Waitchie is mostly suckers and white ants.

The faithful dog again. A short time back
a foreigner, named Carl Rudolph Gellert (well
known about Georgetown), was found dead in a
bush gunvah at Talbot Creek (Q.). Neighbors had
frequently passed the gunyah, and though they
had not seen the owner for some days, they did
not suspect anything wrong, as his dog always ran
out, harking. When they did look in, they found
Gellert had been dead a week, and was partially
consumed. Presumably the faithful dog would
have kept on watohing while his master lasted.
About an axe-
man :
“ Did y’ ever meet a
bloke called Totara Joe ?”
said Dirty Beard to Billy.
“ Who was Totara
Joe?" asked Billy.
“ He was a well-known
bash-whacker. Yermust
of heard of him. He was
the greatest axeman in
the world. Why, I
thought any chump
knoo ’im. Chop 1 He
could have chopped up
an earthquake 1 He uster
take a mate to work
with him—a cove that
carried a long-handled
shovel. Soon as Joe got
ter business this cove
with the shovel had ter
keep blanky well movin’,
of the two of ’em would
’er been buried alive
with the chips. Chop 1
My oath, Joe could chop?
Yous all know that the
game in bush-failin’ is to
make “ drives,” that is,
to put a back scarf in
the trees in line, and
then cut a big bloke
down, so that in its fall
it sends the one in front
crashin’ into the other
ahead, and so on. You’s
got yer wood down quick
if yer cunnin’ at that.
Joe’s best performance
at that was in the Forty
Mile Bush. He went
back scarfing for a week,
and after he had cut
his driver down, him
and the cove with the
shovel went into Dannevirke. The everlastin’ row them
trees made cornin’ down was terrible. Blokes thought
the end of the world had come. After Btoppin’ in town
for a week’s spree, Joe and the shovel bloke went back
and measured up the drive.”
“ How much ? ” said Billy Hart.
“ Forty acres,” replied Dirty Beard.
Billy staggered to the door. “ I’ll go out for a spell,'
he said.

More casualness : A Gippsland wood-
carter left his horse to find its way home, the
other day, while he slumbered placidly in the
dray. As the horse was quite blind, it presently
walked over a bank into the canal and took with
it driver, dray and another horse and jinker which
were tied on behind. The casual woodman
wakened and sat up on the bottom of the canal,
and swam gradually ashore, but no more was seen
of the blind horse. Some canal boat will pro-
bably go aground on its bones in future years.

A refreshing whiff from the terminus of
the first Victorian narrow-gauge railway, in the
Upper King country, via Wangaratta :
The closer settlement at Whitfield is an eye-opener as
to what can be done by practical industrious men on a
small area of land. The estate that formerly fed cattle,
sheep, and rabbits, and employed two or three people to
manage it, now feeds scores of families directly and in-
directly. Every holding is a picture—the homestead
plain and neat, and dairy herd sleek and fat, the fields
strong and vigorous in crops of all kinds. Bags of
potatoes stand thick in every field, maize 10 and 12 feet
high drying off, and pumpkins by thousands of tons
lying like huge cannon balls over the fields. The
creamery is besieged by loaded milk carts, and the State
schools (two) are filled with the settlers’ “olive branches.”
They are evidently making more money out of their 100-
acre blocks than most selectors do out of their thousands
of acres.
If the big land monopolist were abolished, that
great waste and wilderness of blank grass which
stretches from Melbourne’s back door almost to
Geelong might flourish in similar fashion, and
then the rush of Victoria’s population to look for
land in Africa might perhaps be stayed.

“ Paroo ” sends a picture of the hospitality
of a wayback licensed caravanserai:—
Outback recently I struck an old shanty bear-
ing the legend “Travellers’ Rest.” Walked
into the so-called bar, and found a man sitting
on the floor operating on his corns with a
buteher’s-knife.
“ Are you the landlord?”
“ Can’t you see I am ? ”
“ Well, give me a glass of brandy.”
“Brandy? D’ye think you’ve struck the
blooming Hotel Australia?”
“ Got any whisky, then ?”
“No ; sold the last bottle t’other day to the
overseer on the station. But I’ve get some
rum.”
“ Is that it?”—pointing to a venomous-looking
greenish fluid in a white bottle.
“ ’Tis so.”
No ; I didn’t drink rum. Could I have a
bed? Was shown into a room ; bedstead made
of old packing-cases, walls of whitewashed calico.
In the room on my left was a man (evidently full
up of the landlord’s “rum”) singing “Rock of
Ages.” In the room on my right was a boy in
bed teaching a cattle-pup to “sit up.” Verily,
this was a “ Travellers’ Rest.”
About midnight I fell asleep, and when I
awoke in the morning I heard the landlady
call out—“ Tommy, run down and see if there is
anything on the line.” In a few minutes back
came Tommy, bawling : “No, mother ; there’s
nothing on the hook.”
On coming out of the room I met the landlady.
“ Good morning, sir," she said. “ I am very
sorry there is no meat in the house, and Tommy
tells me there is no fish on the line, but if you
wouldn’t mind killing a goat (as my ’usband
ain’t none too good this morning) you could ’ave
some ‘fry’ for breakfust.” Told the lady I
didn’t care about “fry,” but, to oblige her, I
would kill the goat. While she was hunting for
the butcher’s tools I looked out into the yard,
and saw the victim waiting—a half-bred Angora,
and a gentleman at that. The butcher’s
knife couldn’t be found ; and, as I wasn’t over-
anxious to assassinate an old William-goat with
a blunt pocket-knife, I left without any break,
fast.

“ A.C.” : Why is it that no effort
has been made to acclimatise the Murray
cod in the eastern streams of N.S.W. and
Victoria? Great trouble and expense have
been taken to acclimatise trout, 6almon,
Eerch, &c. These imported fish are no
etter in flavor than the cod, and they don’t
come within coo-ee of him for size. When
the inland fish are taken from running water they
have no “ muddy ” flavor. It is when the streams
cease flowing that the jew, cod, and yellow-belly
develop that peculiar twang.

“6xB Re the oft-told yarn
about the luck of the boozer. Walking
along our under-ground paddock fence
t’other afternoon, I spied between tl.e
trunk of a Cape gooseberry-tree and a
straining-post a huddled something
which, at first glance, appeared to be a
second-1 land reaper and binder. Closer
inspection, however, revealed a sound-
asleep tipsy drover, in charge of
a travelling mob of Angora cats.
Aroused, he informed me in lurid lingo
that be bad climbed the gooseberry-
tree after a White Bird of Sheol with
green wings, pink tail, blue top-knot,
four yellow legs, three diamond-stud-
ded golden beaks, and red claws of
galvanised iron. When he reached tne
tree-top the bird flew upward, and he
climbed after it into space for a tew
hundred feet, when he suddenly came
down “wallop,” with Ins back across
the top rail of the fence, breaking right
through the two ironbark rails and
five steel wires ! His neck, back, botn
arms, breast and collar-bones and all
his ribs were broken. He rose and
hiccoughed : “ Thash nothing ; I m all
right, ole man,”—and then staggered
across the near-by railroad just in time
to get caught and entangled m the
wheels of a passing express train, which
dragged him along out of sight. Going
home late that night from a prayei-
meeting, I met him again in the
crowded bar of the “Drovers’ Rest, in
the middle of a step-dance. He didn t
know me again, but casually remem-
bered a bit of a spill be had bad during
the afternoon. The luck of the boozy
per ion is indeed wonderful to behold .
It often borders on grnesomeness.

“ Vigilans ” writes ;
One hundred and twenty miles from Eucla, on the S.A.
side, there is a station called Null-Arbor. This property
has been ruined owing to the depredations of wi
dogs and rabbits, and other causes. Stock has almost
entirely disappeared, and the few remaining sheep have
to be'shepherded. The S.A. Government, in all its
wisdom, is now fencing 60 miles of this run with a so-
called “dog-proof fence.” It makes me laugh . ihe
posts are two chains apart, with braces here and there,
the wire-netting is 3ft, sin. out of the ground, with two
barbed wires on top. It blows like blazes across these
plains, and Jenkins’ fence will go flying into N.S.W. one
of these days. The people who have this run are now
attempting, or going te attempt, the task of clearing it
of vermin when fenced. By the way, a squatter has the
contract for carrying this netting from Eucla at £5 per
ton, and has five camel teams employed ; not a white
man is to be found amongst them.

“War E.” : Even a land agitator in
N.S.W. needs a long memory! At the recent
inquiry into the resumption of Mimosa Station
(N.S.W.) for closer settlement purposes, two
leading lights of the Fanners’ and Settlers
Association stated on oath that a man could make
a living off 600 acres of land and pay 2s. 6d. rent
per acre for it. Yet these are the same persons
who are howling so violently about the tyranny of
the Government in asking the poor down-trodden
“ cocky ” to pay more than Is. per acre for O.P. s
(the land becomes absolutely freehold in 28 years);
the soil is similar and in many cases nearer the
railway than the Mimosa blocks. At the same
inquiry one “expert” based his experience as a
land-valuer on the fact that as a boy he had won a
ploughing match.
DINNER CAMP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Easy, lads, for a long way yet
Is the road you’ll travel to Hergott town ;
But the feed is good, and the season wet,
So block the leaders, and steady ’em down.
See ’em spreading across the flat—
Half a thousand, and Queensland bred,
Roans, whites, cherries, and rolling fat,
Cropping the trefoil with bended head.
Hear ’em sigh in their full content
As they drop in the shade of the noonday camp,
Where the pungent strength of the gidgee’s scent
Mingles with odors of grasses damp.
A softened jingle of pack-horse bells
Rings out from the curve of a distant bend,
While the far-off mutter of thunder tells
Of a storm to fall ere the daylight end.
Through the lazy hours of the midday halt
The lean brown horsemen smoke and drowse,
Till the sun droops down in the clear blue vault
To the west, and the sluggish cattle rouse
And straggle out from the shady trees
As their heads to the lush green grass go down.
Steady, beauties, and take your ease,
’Tis a long, long journey to Hergott town.

“E.S.S.”: Under the new regulations
issued by the Queensland Government, employers
of half-caste and black gins are required to pay the
wages agreed upon in full to
the local Protector, who will
place the money to the black
depositor’s oredit in the Sav-
ings Bank. Such money will
be available when necessaries
are wanted, upon application
being made to the Protector.
The males are left to look
after their own financial
affairs until the present ex-
periment has had a trial.
Murri’s “necessaries” are
mostly rum and tobacco,
and as to his business
acumen, his wages account
in the old days was mostly
settled by “ book yabba.”
The formula was some*
thing like this: Squatter :
“There’s 21b. tobacco you
got—lss.” Murri: “Das
right.” S. : There’s lib.
you didn’t get, 7s. 6d.”
M. : “ Das right.” S. :
“One pound you’ll never
get—7s. 6d.” And so with the
boots he was going to get, and the shirts he
ought to have got —till only a couple of shillings
were required to balance the account. Very
often the luxuries he had no hope of getting
left Murri in debt, and he had then to work off
the “dead horse ” before he could get credit for
the pants he didn’t want. Murri has gained a lot
of financial experience since those days, but still,
when accounts are settled quarterly, the old book
can * ‘ yabba ” a heap.
“ Peri ” re the great Irvine-Bent job ab
Waranga Basin :
Things are awfully bad. The splendid rains have proved
the country’s salvation, but the toilers’ damnation.
Haven’t worked a full week these last ten weeks. The
ground is glue and pea soup, and unworkable after rain.
Horses are sitting on their tails half their time instead of
hauling, having no foothold. Contractor is at his wits’
end to keep his unfortunates together, so he has put
them on at stone-breaking. They earn 4s. 6d. a day
when proficient—9d. a yard, or Is. 6d. a yard and take
the stuff out yourself. Another lot he put on at sleeper
hewing (ss. a hundred, ye gods) for the proposed tram-
way to the quarry, 1| miles away. Three men went out,
strong of heart, put in three weeks at the game, cut 500
sleepers, which averaged Bs. 3d. per man for the three
weeks work, so the contractor raised the rate to 7s. 6d.
per 100 —treacle and pollard at that. Fossicking is the
last resource till machinery supersedes the team-haulage,
and the king of the Waranga Basin fossickers made a
haul of 18s. for a week’s fossicking. “No work, no
credit!” is the cry in the few stores remaining. On
O’Reilly Bros’, contract things are just as bad. No
farmer within cooee can keep a fowl or pig, and there’s
the smell of Sheol all round. Spring should see thing 3
improving, but the Lord only know?.

“ Djin Djin ” : In some parts of the North
Island of Maoriland, especially up Maungakaiiia
way, the much-belauded brown man and woman
are living the life of the dog, and worse—herding
together in hopeless indolence, abject poverty,
and unspeakable squalor. Traversing a country
of 40 miles, not a solitary crop is to be seen, but
on all sides evidence of abso'Ae want and lack of
the decencies of life. The filthiness of the Maori’s
surroundings is too amazing for print; unkempt,
unwashed, half-naked, they huddle together like
swine, in smoky, grimy whares scarcely fit for the
habitation of the pigs and mongrels that in-
fest the settlement. Referring to the degenerate
state of the natives in the King Country since the
advent of the white man, Stipendiary Magistrate
Northcote recently said he had been through the
King Country many years ago, when the natives
were a healthy, clean-living, vigorous people, but
now men, women, and children were addicted to
drunkenness, and an all-round degeneracy had set
in.
“ Sat On”: When prospecting in Queens-
land, a blackfellow and lubra came to tha camp.
Gave them a good feed. Presently the blissful
feeling in the belt region sent the man off into a
doze. The lubra squatted on the ground a little
distance off smoking. I got my sun-glass fixed
on a longish bit of stick and got the sun-ray
focussed on the part of the aboriginal which a
white man usually covers with pants. Presently
there was a most fearsome yell, and a wildly
excited blackfellow clawing at his hindquarters.
“My word, what phella that, mine tinket big
phella hornet bite alonga this phella hide. Why
you laugh, you woman. I teach it you laugh at
me.” After the lubra was duly corrected, and
things settled a bit, I reckoned the lady deserved
her revenge, and I showed her how to manipulate
the burning glass. In due course she got a most
lovely point on the same spot. Then that black
man went four feet into the air at a moment’s
notice. “Ah-a-a, blurry big phella snake bite
this phella hide this time, plenty deep, plenty
soon die, mine tinkit,” he remarked before he
came down out of the atmosphere. Fear of more
waddy kept the gin from grinning that time, but
she looked the most completely satisfied female in
Australia.

The following appeared in the Age lately :
A gentleman at Beeac has been unfortunate in losing a
number of his best fowls in a peculiar manner. The
birds were in the habit of roosting on the axles of the
railway trucks and a special train which left Beeac at
night took away the trucks and the fowls also, some of
them hanging to the perch till the train reached Geelong.
The owner, who was returning home, was startled to sea
some of his own fowls on the Geelong station.
About which it can only be said that they were a
very adhesive kind of fowl.

HIS LAST COIN.
STONY TRAVELLER: “ For Gated’s sake gimme a
dorg’s worth o’ beer, boss.”
The sad story of a drunken pony :
Tartarin was a piebald pony on the station where I was
working. Left an orphan early, he was brought up by
hand. He was the horror of the women-folk, as he had
an affectionate way of running after everyone who came
into the paddock and wanting to shake “hands.” The
boss’s boy had taught him, amongst numerous other
tricks, to stand perfectly still while the lad danced api s
seul on his back ; after which he would gallop him roun ,
sitting back to front, and steering by the tail. Tartarn.
would steal into the yard when the washing was hanging
out, and chew the edges of the articles till each item was
graced with a sort of embroidered border. Sometimes
his appetite took a turn for curtains, which he would pull
out of windows left open on warm nights, frightening
the youngsters into fits. He was also a petty lareenist.
I have seen him coming out of the store, after stealing
sugar, with a face of bahe-like innocence, blissfully un-
conscious that his muzzle was beautifully frosted with
white crystals. He would eat red herrings and drink
brandy. Drink, by-the-way, was the death of him. One
Sunday afternoon I had occasion to go into the store,
and there was Tartarin lying hopelessly drunk, and with
both fore-legs broken. He had pulled the plug out of a
Cask of whisky, tipped it to one side, and “ toped” his
fatal fill.
A PLAIN UNVARNISHED LIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am not good at truthful tabs,
So let me tell a lie !

Because that ain’t its proper name—
This yarn is purely Lie !
All Lie I
It’s nothing else but Lie !
Well, Thomas Brown and William Jcnes
Had farms near Gundabye ;
Grew thistles, Bathurst burrs and stones,
Or wheat when not too dry.
Now Brown’s farm, you must undi rstand,
Was on the hill-side. Soil was grand.
But, Lord ! it was the steepest land ;
Shot upwards to the sky !
The farm of Jones was down below,
The farm of Brown up high,
The mountain slops was steep, you know,
Straight plumb, or very nigh !
An earthquake came ! The farm < f Brown,
With house and orchard, all slid down
And smothered Jones’s ! Like that town
Some folks call “ Pompey-Eye ” !
Well, Jones he swore he'd go to law
And make Brown shift his farm.
But Brown replied : “ I’m nearly sure
I never meant no harm.
This talk of law is all d-—n fine,
But I’m not in the legal line.
You shift your farm from under mine /’*
Said Brown in accents calm.

A.R.W. (Richmond) : Verses unusually awful J.P.C.:
True, but not interesting Kerani: Will print “ Which.”
Can’t remember now why story was rejected ; a story has
to be very good or hideously bad to be remembered a
week after rejection.. ..Tommy Dodd : Seems to us you
are the last possibility in the way of a mule’s father....
R.C. (Melbourne): “Key” melodramatic and incompre-
hensible.. ~G. Elburg: When you propose to postpone
things till Australia ceases to be hard up, you’ve got hold
of a large order. The hardup-ness is mostly based on the
general disinclination to pay taxes and to leave off bor-
rowing, and when these are likely to be over heaven only
knows. In fact, you are another version of the old,
cowardly howl: “We are a poor, miserable race, and
can’t be expected to live on our own means and provide
our own defence as a manly Dutchman or Belgian might.”
K.H. : “Songs of Unrest” and “Town to Country”
neither quite up to mark....F. W. Kennivell: A letter
awaits you at this office.... Bad Eggerty : One verse
looks interestingly mysterious:
If men’s minds are a bubble and a bard for plums not
cash
Treads on the rhythmic pathway with feet of metric
trash,
Will recanting reason’s eddy cause a pallinode be read,
Pleading for for forbearance, as the prompter long is
dead ?
... .H.F. (Norseman) : The story was accepted, though it
is not yet published. Remittance was sent to you on
23rd April J. Byrne : Sorry to say quite impossible to
trace a par. which appeared some years back, unless you
can supply some indication of the date.... Primrose : Ask
the Australasian etiquette lady. Akenehi says she knows
some etiquette, as, for instance, that the best people do
not drink tea out of the saucer ; but your problem is
too involved.... Marco: Moral reflections of a cow
declined; it was too tame a cow C.C.H.: Don’t go
blacklegging any more if you can’t get more interesting
experiences than that Roma : Struggle to get washed
commands our sympathy, but not our space A.
(Christmas Hills): Obstetrical story has merit; but we
must spare the blushes of Jimbill, who is mostly unmar-
ried. .. .Wanna : Plain butchery, not a yarn... .L.E.M. :
Too melodramatic ; not ill-written, but you are following
a cheap-and-nasty pattern... .M.R.W. : Not up G.N. :
Ditto Bassanos: Good idea, but unfortunately it has
been worked out in an American book which had great
vogue some little time ago... .Mick Wray : Yes, we read
it right through. But why didn’t you write the yarn in
the simple, direct style of your letter? Held for further
consideration H.N.: Declined—objectionable Josh:
.But that joke was venerable when Mark Foy and Cleo-
patra sailed down the Nile.. ..Argo : One or two good
items A.E.C. : George Reid’s dog arose thus: For
about a year Reid wearily trotted out an alleged figure
of speech to the effect that the way to teach a small dog
to swim was to throw it in the water, and said that he
had done that with N.S.W. industries by abolishing
Protec!ion. Whereupon The Bulletin pointed out that
he hadn’t abolished Protection for the Freetrade press of
Sydney, at all events. It was the Dry Dog—the dog that
wasn’t thrown into the water to learn to 3trike out on its
own. Reid had other dry dogs, but the Sydney. Free-
trade press was always his driest dog... .F.A. : Can only
stand two verses of “ Miner’s Luck : ”
He was a grey-haired miner
Who worked hard to get 1 is tin,
A id oft he had no dinner
Just to make the tuekei spin.
For many and many a year,
With very prudent care.
And seldom had a beer,
Because he had no tin to spare.
....Only Me: One good item Coulter : Hardly good
enough, yet some good lines in them.. ..F.L.B. : Not a
gleam of inspiration about “ Buster.” Inspiration is
what makes Byron’s verse unlike Jawbone Neild’s ; want
of it is what makes Nsild’s verse different from Byron’s.

expect us to believe that your parson didn’t know how to
pronounce “choir?”....A. Bong : “ J.P.”maygo. Send
in your bill to Bulletin’s accountant for all items pub-
lished, giving date and page, or send in items pasted 01
a sheet of paper, with name and full address, and remit-
tance will follow Haymaker: Not much in your yarn.
....J.G.D. : War poem very much out of date. “Native
Land” is bitter commonplace Billy Bong: Not much
in “ World Moves On.” One verse —the only compre-
hensible one—of the other poem herewith :
It was after one wild lurid jamboree
That a lilliputian jim-jam followed me,
With a deep and lasting sorrow in its eyes.
While astride (in proportion was his size)
Sat a swagged and bearded son of this young land,
Whom the horrors of the Never Never sand
Had left branded with its never-failing brand.
And above the twain a banner floating free,
With “ Australia” stamped upon it I could see.
It was white as our Australia ought to be.
Flo. S. : But The Bulletin poets don’t all kiss the
lady’s hand in their verses. Only the other day one of
them kissed her hair....E. Durst: Bacon joke fit for
private circulation 0n1y... .R.H.P. : Good par. Bad pic-
ture M.F. : “The Victim” is good verse spoiled by
occasional meaningless lines, such as “a slanting sunbeam
can scarcely harm.”... .E.H. : “Storm,” nothing very
new on a very old subject... .Philo : Verses all just
respectable in a quiet elderly tea-meeting sort of way....

Graham Berry.
Gkaham Berry —whose latest photo, appears in
this issue ; Berry whom Victoria knew for so
long as the lusty leader of its Liberal party ; the
stalwart fighter; the incomparable stump-speaker,
full of flashing phrases ; daring, energetic, and
strenuous—is now bent under the weight of years,
which within a month will number 81. He is no
longer able to bear a part in the conflicts of the
day. When he was in his prime the fires burned
fiercely, and consumed the more ; now they burn
low, and the contrast is all the more mai’ked.
Perhaps he himself was the first to mark the
change ; and so, while men said that he
was still vigorous in spite of his 65 years,
he went to England in 1887 as Agent-General;
and Australia saw the old Graham Berry—
the daring Tribune of the People—no more.
When he came back he was a democrat still; but,
with more than 70 years upon him, subdued. The
dignity of honored old age had succeeded a per-
haps too strenuous life of battle. Yet, remember-
ing what he had been, Victoria still had honors
for him. He had held many of its portfolios, had
been its Premier, its Agent-General. Parliament
made him its Speaker now ; and the country chose
him as one of its representatives at the Conven-
tion to frame the Australian Constitution. That
was his last—fittingly his last—appearance in the
larger field of public life. His colleagues, the
onlooker noticed, put him in the front, a white-
bearded patriarch, feeble but courtly; they de-
ferred to him ; they did him honor—and in doing
it did honor to themselves. But, in spite
of a warm welcome, his voice was rarely heard ;
and when he did speak it was rather to offer en-
couragement in a general way, as an old man who
had nearly run his race to a young one entering
on his own, rather than to help in working out
the _ troublesome details of the partnership.
Minister, Premier, Agent-General, Speaker—but
he might have been all these and yet less than he
was. Coming into the public life of Victoria in
the earliest sixties, he found the squattocracy
almost supreme. With a fine courage he fought
to substitute for it a purer democracy. Aiming
also at the creation of an Australian sentiment
and an Australian nation—aiming to make
Australia fit to stand on its own foundations—
he blazed the track, too, for Protection. He
was more than a politician ; he was a leader ; he
moulded opinion ; and it may be some comfort to
the old Tribune in his closing days to know that
young Australia remembers his services, remem-
bers them with gratitude, and will continue to
remember them. .

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
11. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-st., Melbourne, is the largest buyer of
Opals, Sapphires, Pearls and other Australian
gems, and consignors will find it to their advantage
to send their parcels direct to him. The firm has
a reputation for straight-dealing, extending over a
period of 40 years, which is a sufficient guarantee
that they will be honorably treated. A trial par
cel, which will be followed by direct remittance
is solicited.
Melbourne Age, in a recent lament about
the wholesale departure from Victoria of its most
vigorous bread-winners, writes thus about the
elect of Kyabram:
The M'Kenzie regime at the Lands Office was exactly
what the Oameron occupancy of the Mines and Water
Supply Department is, and what that of Mr. Murray is in
the Chief Secretaryship. It would have stagnated any
State as far as bad government can do so.
Bent, Shiels, and Irvine are also fallen idols.
“6 x 8” : Irvine’s blackleg crews of
“loyal” engine-drivers are no doubt just now,
and will be for some little time, despised by the
union drivers. That sort of thing never lasts
long. One of the faults of the unionist is his
habit of too quickly forgetting things. There are
to-day paid office-holders in Australian trades
unions (I am personally acquainted with some)
who have in the past “ ratted ” on their respective
unions and otherwise worked against Labor in-
terests, and both the men who elected them and
their fellow officers know it.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.

figurements. Sulpholine developes a lovely skin.

Apropos of the cry about how “ Socialistic
legislation ” is driving foreign capital out of Aus-
tralia, it is interesting to remember that foreign
capital has also been almost entirely driven out of
the tlnited States, France and Germany. The
people there simply set to work under huge Pro-
tective tariffs, and made capital for themselves.
Their own capital drove out the foreign article.
Let us do likewise.
“Victoria has been hitherto governed by
a squattocracy, and men willing to work bad to
pay men who did not work as much as 15s. an
acre for the privilege of cultivating the soil.” —
Tom Mann.
Governor Phillip’s first piece of land
legislation granted to married soldiers 40 acres
each, two assigned servants each, rations for three
years, and seeds, farm implements and building
materials —all to induce settlement. Australia
started with State socialism.
The man on the Land is always in trouble,
but his troubles end when he places his business
in the hands of Land Agent W. N. Willis, of 21
Bligh-street. No results, no fees, is his business
shingle.*
SUFFERING WOMEN.

headaches, biliousness, dizziness, sallowness of

and liver tablets will invariably bring relief.

For the past seven years Canada has not
added a penny to its public debt, but, besides
wiping something off the slate, has paid for all
current works out of revenue. For the preceding
18 years it borrowed at the average rate of
£1,300,000 per annum. And the gain in popula-
tion and wealth has been greater in the seven
years when there was no borrowing than it was in
the 18 years when the debt was being piled up.
Taxation more than sufficient to allow the country
to pay its way lias thus had the very opposite
effect to scaring away either capital or people.

N.S.W. PATRIOTIC FUND
REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMHITTEE
For the Year 1902=1903,
Presented to and adopted by the General Committee at the Meeting
held on Wednesday, 22nd July, 1903,
THE RIGHT HON. THE LORD MAYOR (ALD. THOS. HUGHES) PRESIDING.
Your Executive Committee have met twenty-three (23) times since 30th July, 1902.
First Applications for Relief during’ that period totalled 334, which were dealt with by
grants being made in all but two instances. ,
Applications for Further Relief. —No less than 500 applications “ for further assistance ’’
have been considered, several of the applicants having applied over and over again. These applica-
tions have been most carefully examined to enable your Executive Committee to judge whether any
new points have been adduced by the applicants which would warrant the granting of the “ further
assistance ’’ asked for. Wherever your Executive Committee were satisfied on the merits of the case,
further relief has been granted.
Many applicants seem to be imbued with the idea that the fund was intended “to support” and
not merely “ to assist.”
The total donations to the fund since its inception (2nd November, 1899) amount to £52,467 13s.
10d., and interest earned has amounted to £3674 18s. sd.
The amount distributed in relief from Ist July, 1902,
to 30th June, 1903, is £6,420 0 0
Less repaid to Bank _ .. 166 u g
£6,253 8 6
Previously to 30tb June, 1902, it was 21,386 10 0
Making a grand total since initiation of fund .. .. £27,639 18 6
1 his amount is m ide up as follows :
Widows and children ..' .. .. .. £2,034 15 0
Other dependents .. 4,141 0 0
Wounded and invalided 21,464 3 6
£27,639 18 6
The Executive Committee have again to thank the authorities for their courteous assistance in investigating
applications from the country districts.
The place of Mr. Richard Teece, whose resignation from the Committee was received at last annual meeting
must, in compliance with By-law No. 4, be filled at this meeting.
As provided for under By-law No. 8, a statement of receipts and expenditure has to be published in the month
of July in each year.
This statement, duly signed by the Trustees, and audited b.v Mr. David Fell (C.A.A.), Public Accountant is
now placed before you, and, on adoption, will be published as required by the By-laws.

Sydney, 9th July, 1903. J. RUSSELL FRENCH / and Trustees.
The centenary of Tasmania is to be cele-
brated on 12th Sept. On that day, 100 years ago,
Lieut. Bowen landed near Hobart, from Sydney,
with a party of soldiers and convicts and began
the settlement.
The Freetraders are bidding for the
woman’s vote at next Federal elections with the
dazzling promise of cheapened drapery and
things. Already the voice of the genteel bargain-
hunters is heard proclaiming that all women are
Freetraders.
It is somewhat of a burlesque on repre-
sentative institutions that, according to Joe
Chamberlain’s table of precedence, baronets—
Rupert Clarke, for instance—take precedence in
Commonwealth functions over members of either
Federal House, Ministers excepted, and over
State Ministers and Judges.
W. P. Crick’s duties as N.S.W. Minister
of Lands are wide-embracing. Take this, posted
up at the Necropolis : “No corpse can be removed
from one grave to another without written per-
mission from the Minister of Lands.”
A “Barmaids Abolition Bill” has been
introduced in Maoriland’s House of Reps, by a
private member. It provides that, after July,
1904, no female, other than the licensee, shall
serve drinks. If it becomes law, the vision behind
the bar passes away in less than 12 months, and
some uninteresting object with whiskers takes its
place.
From the letter of a prominent English-
man who knows Australia:
We are all busy thinking of our colonies and whether
they will join in Mr. Chamberlain’s preferential tariff
scheme. I have assumed that Australia, at any rate, will
not do anything of the kind. It would cripple her
nascent industries without giving any adequate return.
Mr. Chamberlain has broken up one political party and
now seems likely to spoil another. The difficulty is the
extraordinary weakness of Mr. Balfour. . . . The Tory
party is rent in twain and quite unable to appeal to the
country until it has settled its own differences.
“Ilex” writes:
Re the recent prosecution of Vic. State school teacher
Mead for disapproving of the Bent-Irvine Government:
In the “new revised programme of Public Instruction”
it is set down explicitly that teachers must, among other
things, hold forth to their pupils on “ Howthe wish of
the people becomes law,” “ How the laws are carried
out,” and the “ Duties of a citizen.” Moreover, he is to
treat his topic in such a manner as “to give children an
intelligent appreciation of the origin of and the reasons
for our leading national institutions.” And yet the
teacher isn’t to talk polities, and mustn’t speak disre-
spectfully of the Upper House.
“If we have not the pluck to undertake
our own defence we should blot out the stars from
the Commonwealth flag and substitute a miser-
able skulking dingo, or a kangaroo with its tail
between its legs.— A. Paterson, on the
Naval Tribute Bill.
Laseelles, the mighty Vic. Mallee land
grabber, has requisitioned for the inclusion of Pay-
trap and other big estates in his lease in addition
to the 35,000 acres now held at Tyrrell Downs, and
it is generally understood that the Deformed
Government is considering the matter in a
friendly spirit.
If honorable members of Australia’s 14
Houses of Legislature ceased calling each other
honorable, and took each other’s honorableness
for granted, it would save a good deal of time and
print. Surely the honorableness is sufficiently
conspicuous to stand by itself without all this
repetition.
The Imperial Government is about to
erect a naval prison on Garden Island at a cost of
£6OOO. The curious part of this quiet arrange-
ment is that the British Government builds the
prison while the local Government defrays the
expense of all the other buildings. The new
gaol is for the punishment of refractory seamen,
tried in hole-and-corner fashion and practically
condemned unheard, yet the prison will be within
the Commonwealth, but not subject to any super-
vision by the Federal or State authorities.
From London Truth :
We see no reason why Africa should be ransacked to
provide the mines with the cheap labor of crimped blacks,
nor do we believe that we ought to allow the mine-owners
to contract for gangs of Chinese in order to make money
without paying English workers a fair price, and to pre-
vent the “ serpent ” of trade unionism finding an entry
into the Transvaal. The working men of the United
States and Australia have put down their foot in regard
to cheap colored labor. The working men of South Africa
are against it, whilst in England, if a coal-owner were to
import Chinese labor to enable him to get better divi-
dends from rich coal seams, and to work poor ones with a
profit, any Government that did not very speedily step
in to prevent this lowering of trade-union prices would
have a very short shrift. What, I wonder, would be
thought if an English coal-owner were to say that coal-
owners should be allowed to employ black savages and
Chinese to work in coal-pits, but that all municipalities
must employ Englishmen at trade-union wages, in order
that the coal-owners should have a monopoly of cheap
labor? The real method of dealing with the labor
question in the Transvaal is to follow the example of the
United States, and to permit no laborers, whether white
or black, to enter the country if they are under any con-
tract to perform work when there. Workers imported
under contract are slaves, except in name. They are
picked up by some speculator, and they sign under-
takings about which they know nothing.


POLITICAL
POINTS
Record of N.S.W. Parliamentary session
at time of going to press : Five counts out, two
censure debates, one fight, and no work done.
N.S.W. Government is at last making a
move to regulate the sale and use of firearms, and
the annual pea-rifle mortality is thus likely to be
reduced.
Fremantle (W.A.) is seeking for powers
to construct and work municipal tramways. It
is about up to the Snow-diddled city of Adelaide
to follow suit. !
Long ago an ex-colleague of Kingston’s
said : “ Ybs, it’s rather hard work to get on with
Kingston sometimes. But it’s a lot harder work
to get on without him. ”
Almost every member who spoke on the
Address-in-Reply in S.A. Assembly kicked and
cuffed the Jenkins Iscariot Ministry. And Iscariot
merely smiled, and said “Thank you.” That
training as a Yankee book-canvasser was invalu-
able.
The Queensland Government proposes an
Act to suppress the sale of John Snorting’s paper
on Sunday. If it passes, the only result will be
that John’s paper will talk to Philp with extra
vigor on Saturday night, and the gain will be
dubious, to say the least.
Consider the words of one Dick, member
for Newcastle East, in N.S.W. Assembly: “It
looks as if it was absolutely hopeless for any
money for the ordinary loan services of the State
to be obtained.” This is surely a new term in
political economy; what are the “ordinary loan
services ” of any State ?
Page, Federal Member for the Maranoa
(Q.), exhibits vouchers showing that, in a recent
tour of his electorate (and he skipped about one-
tliird of it), his hotel expenses and coach travelling
amounted to JE23 2. The Democracy must tackle
such problems if it is ever to escape from repre-
sentation by the M‘Billions.
DESIGNED.
The Ministry separates, and Kingston goes his
own Road.
Governor Le Hun be had hardly settled
down in Adelaide and got his night-shirt unpacked,
when he was waited on by a deputation of the un-
employed. Once the unemployed only called, on
Ministers who might be able to give them- work;
now in a general, sorrowful, hopeless sort of way
they call on everybody. It isn’t a change for the
better. -
It has come at last. A meeting of the
Box Hill (Vic.) branch of the Kyabram Reform
League has' passed a resolution in favor of abolish-
ing payment of members and asking the Central
League to get a direct vote of the electors taken
on the subject at next election. But why bother
about the ejectors ? Why not pass a small measure
of that sort on to Irvine?
Westralia’s Governor, a retired vice-
admiral who never makes a speech without some
reference to “Britain’s grand old navy,” has
apparently taken warning from the recent protest
in Federal circles against State Governoi s’ inter-
ference with politics. He had arranged to deli ver
an address to members of the A.N. A. on “Britain’s
noble fleets,” but has now cried off.
The begging socialistic farmer again ! A
recent meeting of Wangaratta (Vic.) tobacco-
growers unanimously resolved that “the educa-
tion of tobacco-growers in improved methods of
growing, handling and curing leaf, hitherto
adopted by, the State Government, having been of
great value to the grower, should be continued.”
It also demanded a big subsidy to encourage it to
export its own tobacco. The meeting was enthu-
siastic as well as unanimous, and its approval of
the idea that the city artisan should be taxed to
pay for State assistance to the farmer was almost
violent in its intensity.
Haven Shiels, of Victoria, who knew
about so many superfluous public servants
loafing on the Treasury, becomes one of the
clan himself. He is to be Railways Minister at a
big salary, but railway construction isn’t to be in
his department, and railway management is to be
looked after by Commissioner Tait, and Shiels is
to be a loafing pauper with a sinecure.
There is one aspect of Bill’s dirt money
which is apt to be overlooked. Where are the
men who were sacked from the Fitzroy Dock to
make room for those who brought letters of
recommendation from a M.L.A. ? The man who
will crawl to a Minister or a member for a job
can’t always be accommodated without sacrificing
the probably better man who doesn’t crawl.
The Federal Capital Commission, ap-
pointed by the Australian Government, was not
so constituted as to command any confidence ; one
member in particular meant a discount of 75 per
cent, on the value of its conclusions. It is not at
all surprising, under the circumstances, that it puts
in the forefront of its recommendations two un-
suitable sites in Minister Bill Lyne’s electorate.
Brisbane Government press was howling
indignantly some weeks ago about the audacity of
Federal members who dared to meddle in State
politics and of State politicians who mixed up in
Federal affairs. In the midst of the denuncia-
tions State Premier Philp arose and announced
that he intended to fight the Federal Government
next election for all he was worth. The press
subsided.
The N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor party
has degenerated woefully in its ideas of political
honesty since it professed to throw out Reid over
a far smaller financial misdoing than Owe’Sulli-
van’s Fitzroy Dock scandal. Reid unjustifiably
paid away a few hundreds, and the Labor party
ejected him. Owe’Sullivan threw away many
thousands, and the Labor party actually sup-
ported him.
The first Federal candidate on deck in
Tasmania is W. J. M‘Williams, of Launceston
Daily Twaddlkgrapii. He says :
I am strongly opposed to the lavish expenditure, actual
and proposed, of the Federal Government and Parliament,
and the extravagant manner in which the affairs of the
Federation are being conducted. lam an advocate of a
Revenue Tariff.
What a useful and impudent lie is that “lavish
Federal expenditure”—mainly based on the fact
that it was proposed to appoint five Federal
Judges to do law business for the whole Common-
wealth, with its 4,000,000 people, while Tasmania,
with less than a twentieth of the population,
thinks it needs three Supreme Court Judges for
its local business alone. Every dullard who can’t
think of anything else to say says he is “against
Federal extravaganoe.”
At recent manoeuvres of the British
squadron located in Australia the Wallaroo was
accidentally struck twice by torpedoes fired by
the Royal Arthur. Fortunately, they were only
practice torpedoes; if they had been fully loaded
.there would have been no more Wallaroo. An
official explanation will, doubtless, show that it
was nobody’s fault, but it gives an uneasy feeling
with regard to the British navy when, even in
moments of peace and calm, it shoots so wildly.
N.S.W. Public Service Board advertised
for two typists for the Arbitration Court the
other day, and, , without any appearance of shame,
printed its scandalous conditions. Applicants are
to pay a fee of 10s. to have their qualifications
tested. “But,” the shark-officialdom . goes, on,
“if, after examination, it is found that a person
permanently in the public service is qualified, he
will be preferred even if lie obtain less marks than
other candidates.” Surely the Commissioners
should at least have tested the employees in the
service before inviting outsiders to compete and
contribute half-sovereigns. Having invited out-
siders, surely merit should tell. Is it all merely a
dodge to raise money ?
About the must cheering cabled news
received from the Cold Country for some time
is the statement that the leadingEnglishunder-
writers have decided not to underwrite for some
time to come any more Australian loans. If this
decision is strictly adhered to, Premier Irvine is in
a tight place with the big loan that is now falling
due. It will be a dreadful thing if that prim
lawyer hp,s to tell the British Cohen that the loan
is renewed whether Cohen likes it or not. Also,
there are indications that a time is rapidly
approaching when Premier Irvine will be abso-
lutely driven to tax the wealthy landowners of
'Melbourne.
SHIELS’ SAVINGS. —THE VICTORIAN BUDGET POSITION.
“F.C.” : It is ever hard to overtake a lie,
but it is worth while starting in pursuit, anyhow.
Victorian employers already blather abroad
Works Inspector Davidson’s alleged pronounce-
ment against day labor as being 40 per cent,
dearer than the contract system. Davidson
said nothing of the sort. What he did say was in
a report on the Mount Fatigue roads, started as
unemployed relief works, and was to the effect
that the system adopted—piece-work, not day-
labor —cost 40 per cent, more than contract prices
would have done.
South Australia’s new Governor, LeHunte,
spoke thus at an Adelaide Salvarmy function :
England always welcomed those who found it hard to
stay in their own land, from whence they were driven by
persecution. . . . England always took people on trust,
and it would be well if Australia always looked on people
with trust, and not with suspicion.
The Englishman, who decides that four-fifths of
the people of his own blessed empire can’t be
trusted with any self-governing powers whatever,
is always quite sure that he doesn’t look on any-
body with suspicion.
At the Argos’ instigation Vic. Minister
Carrieron, a dour Scotchman with no humor of his
own, played off a beautiful joke upon his life-long
political enemy, David Syme. The Argus gravely
announced that Cameron was recommending the
Cabinet to negotiate for the purchase of the View
Hill, Killara, and Dairy estates, which were all
elaborately described, with details as to the excep-
tional railway facilities, and the wasteful profusion
of railway stations in the middle of the properties.
The humor lies in the fact that all three belong to
David Syme, who has strongly advocated compul-
sory resumption of big estates for closer settle-
ment, though it doesn’t necessarily follow that he
wanted his own estates resumed.
“ Q.” : Judging by some of his remarks to
the Ballarat branch of the A.N.A., the Cool Calm
Cuss, who is afraid to tax the wealthy landowners
of Melbourne, is hard at work trying to screw up
his courage to go in for a compulsory land re-
sumption scheme. It is all very well to talk
about the thousands of acres of well-watered, fer-
tile lands which are at present carrying sheep and
must, in the future, carry men ; but why doesn’t
the cool, strong bounder do something? While
he talks at banquets his agricultural population is
streaming away solely because it can’t get land to
settle on. Already Victoria is about to lose one
Federal member because of its diminishing
importance, as compared with other States, and
there are other humiliations to follow.
Tt> a deputation of Sydney unemployed
which waited on him with a request that he
should help them to find work in America (!),
U.S. A. Consul Baker took some pains to ex-
plain the severely restrictive nature of the U.S.
immigration laws. No person is admitted to
the States who is likely to become a pauper
through disease or otherwise, who is under
contract, who has ever been in a poor-house or in
receipt of alms, or who has not 30 dollars in his or
her possession. With all these restrictions the
U.S. attracts a huge number of immigrants
yearly; but then the country can offer them work.
When the Australian tariff is built on American
lines we will be able to do the same. The un-
employed and their friends would do well to
encoiirage Protection in Australia—to make work
here instead of deluding themselves with wild-cat
emigration schemes.
Jenkins Iscariot includes barrage works
at the mouth of the Murray among his public
works proposals. The thing has been talked
about for 40 years or more ; the object is simply
to dam back the sea-water, and so im-
prove the country with frontages to the
lower river and shallow lakes near its
mouth. But it's a small scheme to talk
about so long; something less than
£60,000 would do it all. Jenkins rightly
proposes to apply the betterment prin-
ciple to the job; so, locally, it isn’t
quite so popular as it was before they
went into details.
If the N.S.W. Labor party had thrown
out Owe’Sullivan and Co. over the Fitzroy Dock
disgrace, the new Premier would have depended
on it for his majority, for it still holds the
Parliamentary balance. That would have been
policy. A very few more Owe’Sullivan revela-
tions, and the direct Government following will
disintegrate so badly that the next Premier won’t
depend on the Labor party for his majority; lie
will have enough followers without it. ' That will
be just muddle. Moreover, if the Labor party
had quitted Owe’Sullivan the other day it would
have had the joy of seeing Carruthers eat his
proud assurance that he would never hold office
and be dependent on the Labor vote. Another
year or so and Joseph may be able to keep his
promise by accident, and then his pride .and
bounceableness will be insufferable.
The way Irvine is shuffling the Ministerial
cards looks as if Vic. Government is to be a one-
man affair. Lately the cool calm person told
Mines Minister Cameron that he would attend
personally to all important matters in Cameron’a
Department. Much flattery by the dailies has
made Irvine mad enough to reckon he can run
the whole show on his own ; but he hasn’t
Seddon’s endurance, and already cracking sounds,
like the rustle of trodden-on locusts, can be heard,
as the small dry man gives at his oilless joints
with the dead-weight and ballast of portfolios.
■Not only did the British Privy Council
decide in favor of Kingston, in upholding the law
under which ships’ stores must pay duty when
the vessel arrives at its first Australian port, or
must be sealed up and remain so till the vessel
leaves its last Australian port ; but it threw dirt
on the whiskers of the Australian Foreign-trade
press in the process of doing so. For in addition
to deciding that the law held good, it pointed out
that the law was a reasonable, ordinary law,
almost exactly similar to one which had been in
force in Britain for thirty years past. So all the
lies of the importers’ papers about Kingston’s
novel, incredible, and revolutionary device and
his unheard-of act of tyranny fall through
Kingston was only following British precedent 1
There was a Man who had a Relation'
in such Reduced Circumstances as to be almost
a Poor Relation. The Man had Loaned him
some money. The Poor Relation had a Pup-
of the Bull Dog Breed. Said the Man:
“That is a very Little Dog. Put him away
and I will Lend you a Bigger Dog. You;
can find its Tucker, but I will hand it to-
him, for Dogs don’t Bite the Man that Feeds
them. And, as you Owe me Money, the Bailiff
may have to be put in Some Day—it would be
awkward to have a Big Pup of the Bull Dog
Breed in a Poor Relation’s Back-yard. I will
only Take Away My Dog if I Want him
somewhere else. Meanwhile he will be an Orna-
ment to your place, and your girls can Play with-
him.” And the Poor Relation said—well, it
looks as if he were going to say “Yes,” for he is-
very Badly Advised.
Premier See says that he is very sorry that
the N.S.W. Government ever interfered with the
Sydney Rocks resumptions at all. Yet if the
business: had been better engineered there would
have been no cause for grief. It should have-
been enacted that payment for the resumed
‘jJroperties wohld be made in 3J per cent.
Government, securities. There would have been
complaints of “ tyranny ” no doubt, but they
would have died away. Then there would have-
been no unseemly struggles and breakdowns in
the London money market, and the debt would'
have been mostly a local instead of a foreign
liability. Then there should have been a sinking
fund for repayment of the debt; there should
have been no cooking of the accounts and no-
silly grandiose Owe‘Sullivan ; and £250,000 a year-
should have been supplied out of revenue for re-
construction purposes. The want of these things
is the cause of the sorrow.
Queensland Government, which still sticks-
to its scarcity-of-white-labor myth when referring
to the sugar industry, has over
200 men employed on relief?
works, and hundreds
more are waiting.

N.S.W. Opposition Leader Carnflhers is,
as usual, talking flabby platitudes about the-
present upheaval in the loan market. Joseph’s
idea isn't to leave off borrowing but to “ diminish
for a time the demand for public works that may
very well stand over until a more promising out-
look i- before us.” Carruthers missed his vocation.
Providence didn’t mean him for a man but for a.

Another Cure by
VITADATIO
POVERTY OF BLOOD AND
GENERAL WEAKNESS.
428 Ohurch-Btreet, Richmond,
16th August, 1902.
Mr. S. A. PALMER,
Dear Sir, —About six years ago I became very ill, suffer-
ing from poverty of blood and general weakness. My
medical adviser ordered me to the Ararat Hospital. I
remained there for one month, then left, removing to
Ballarat, where I became much worse and very weak.
About four years ago I returned to Melbourne, and
eventually, became so weak I had to take to my bed, and
remained.there eight weeks. Having read a great deal
about Webber’s VITADATIO, I made up my mind to give
it a trial. The first bottle upset me very much, and I
laid it aside for a fortnight, then I called to see you at
Bourke-street, when you strongly advised me to continue
it, stating that it would certainly cure me; so I per-
severed, and after I had taken the fifth bottle I began to
feel much stronger, and, by continuing, my health was
completely restored. It is now three years since I took
the last bottle, and I can truthfully say I would have
been in my grave long ago had it not been for VITA-
DATIO. I can recommend it to anyone suffering as I did,
and hand you this to make use of as you please for the
benefit of other sufferers. I will be pleased to answer
any questions, either by letter or personally, at above
address.
Yours faithfully,
MARJORIE SMITH.
I have known Mrs. Smith for a number of years, and
can truthfully certify that her statement is true in every
particular. She was very low and weak when she com-
menced taking VITADATIO, and the effect was mar-
vellous. Being my next-door neighbour, I saw her daily
until she was quite well. I consider her case a wonderful
cure.

ENGINEMAN’S MASTER KEY. -All subjects

Engineer, 443 Bourke-street, Melbourne. Aire COLE’S,
Melbourne, Adelaida, Sydney,
That magnificent thing Private Enterprise,
which was going to start nearly two years ago and
immediately build electric trams in Adelaide, and
which said then that it had all the money ready,
has again been heard from. The latest news is
that “the whole of the engineering details have
been perfected and the exact scheme prepared
which will be laid before the various tram com-
panies as soon as the papers are to hand.” As
for the money, it doesn’t seem to be to hand, and
nothing is said about beginning work. After all
this delay it appears that some bits of paper are
ready.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Wheat State turfdom generally threatens anni-
hilation of S.A.J.C. as the ruling body of that State
because of many alleged evidences of bias and vacillation,
also through invidious position occupied by S.A.J.C. with
regard to Owners and Trainers’ Association. Existence
of last-named was due to fact of present governing body
repeatedly refusing to give Port Adelaide R.O. another
day’s racing, from which position (as well as one or two
similar ones since) the new organisation and public opinion
compelled S.A.J.C. to clamber down. Proposed by Mr. W.
Robertson (14 years chairman of Adelaide R;C., and at
present steward of S.A.J.C.) that a tribunal unassociated
with any racing club be elected by ballot of members of
all registered clubs, or by dividing the State into three
sections and having representatives from each on some
equitable basis. Another nail' in S.A.J.C.’s coffin was its
refusal, without explanation, to sanction A.R.C.’s appli-
cation for a week’s postponement of latter’s two days’
Grand National meet, the idea being that leppers might
go Adelaidewards after V.A.T.O. gathering, especially as
A.R.C. had added lOOsovs. to prize-money.

The annual registration of the “ bookies ” by the
A.J.0., Sydney, fell due recently, and, judging by the
horde of applicants for registration in N.S.W., followers
of sport will have plenty “layers of odds” to contend
with. There are but two classes of people who appear to
thrive nowadays—the “bookie” and the swindling im-
porter—both by questionable practices. If gambling is
allowed to flourish, it is time the N.S.W. Government
introduced a Totalisator Bill on the same lines as those
now in force in other States—as a protection for the
gambler and as a source of revenue.

The late Tommy Wilson, of Dowling Forest,
materialised at Hobart (Tasmania). In his 17th year he
went to sea. Then he made tarpaulins for £1 a day at
Geelong ; and later, at Ballarat, dug £l5OO worth of gold
out of one hole. Then back to the sea as second mate of
the barque Glencoe, till he took a turn at coach-driving
between Geelong and Ballarat, and becoming a livery -
stable keeper, drifted into horse training. Tommy’s
famous frieze coat, worn off and on for more years than
anyone can remember, will be much missed at Flemington
coming spring.
* * * *
Maoriland House of Representatives, by 34
votes to 14, has squelched the Totalisator Abolition Bill—
the instrument with which the combination of howlers
and “ bookies ” hoped to wreck the system of moderate
and legalised gambling. The League will now crawl back
into its hole, and reflect that its boast of support
from Premier Seddon and almost all the members of the
House looks very like a record lie.
■■* * * •
One of the Maoriland Mo fraternity, fined for
booking bets in the street, pleaded that he was merely
receiving subscriptions towards the burial of two poor
children who had died from measles, or something. No
witnesses were called, however, to prove that they had
been backing “ dead uns.”

This happened at a Sydney suburban ground
recently. Horse-owner carpeted for alleged inconsistent
running, and “ disqualified for 12 months.” “ I expected
this,” said the owner, looking at one of the tribunal,
“ you told certain people you were going to do it.”
“ You’re a liar,” quoth the steward. “You’re another,"
retorted the horse-owner. Tribunal, in'conclave few
minutes later, made the disqualification “life.” Next
morning respectable daily press announced that the big
penalty was inflicted for “abusive” language. Most
puzzling thing in the connection is where any offence
came in. At previous meeting same owner and his nag’s
rider had been cautioned that if anything suspicious
occurred again they would be punished. ‘Race imme-
diately following saw the horse win. What more did these
sapient officials want?

Six residents of Gundagai, said to be all poor
men, drew Lowland Chief in Ta t’s. sweep on G.N.
Hurdles and came in for £2OOO. They pooled £5 each and
sent £3O to L.o.’s jock (Wheeler).
* * * * •
V.R.C. annual report reveals a falling off of
£ll,OOO. While Spring meet of 1901 brought a profit of
£5608, last year’s gathering resulted in £3303 loss, and
though Grand National, New Year’s Day and October
meetings were profitable, the Coronation, Autumn, April
and Prince of Wales Birthday gatherings showed short-
ages.

A.J.O.’s new rule compelling inclusion of
jumping events in Sydney suburban club programmes is
balm to most Victorian cross-country jocks, who, ’tis
alleged, have had a parlous time for long, mainly because
they don’t always get paid unless their mounts get home
first. V.R.O. rule insists that fees shall be lodged at
scale, but jocks frequently have to refund to owners the
whole or half the money. Stated that front-rank rider
Carter went to India mainly because there was nothing
in Melbourne for him unless he rode for the sake of
riding on the off-chance of winning.

How they do things at Broken Hill. Hurdle
race, Wednesday last week, caused something of a mix
up. Said that nearing home turn Listnaghar ran off but
still kept in the race, and at last jump again shirked
bringing Avymore and Pat with him. Judge declared in
favor of Greygown, The Christian, and Coalbox, as named,
then he altered his ruling, giving the places to Listnaghar,
Pat and Greygown. Protests from Greygown’s owner
against Listnaghar and Pat, and from Pat’s owner against
Listnaghar followed. That night stewards dismissed
both kicks and upheld judge’s second decision. Grey-
gown party are appealing to the A.J.O. —and small

Color-Sergeant Davis, who with 311 won the
King’s match concluded at Bisley, Saturday, annexed
same honor 10 years ago. Nearest Australian was H.
Motton (Q.), 38th on the list (with 289) ; he came in for
£l2 and a badge. First in this event is entitled to £250
presented by the King, a gold medal, and a badge.
Prizes total 600 and aggregate £2420. Each of the first
100 gets a badge. Last year’s winner turned up in Lieu-
tenant Johnson, with 307 of a possible 344 ; then most
successful Australian was W. Todd (Vic) who (45th on the
list with an aggregate of 286) secured £l2 and a badge.

Cabled announcement that young North Syd-
ney shot R. O. Dawson annexed Duke of Cambridge
match at Bisley didn’t surprise much, as several big
Australian prizes for long-range shooting have come his
way. Said that he placed 10 bull’s eyes in a 14in. square.
Range was 900yds., and his total (50) the possible. Last
year saw 433 compete for this, and an accumulation of
48 points won it—Carter (Vic.) filling second place with 47.

Australia’s second win in succession of Kolapore
Cup at Bisley last week caused the spilling of much
liquid in Australian rifledom, especially when the ob-
stacles to be overcome before the team was sent ’Ome were
recalled. Last year’s win saw Australia top all previous
figures with 770 of a possible 840 ; this time they have
gone 1 better. Members of the team, A. Carter (Vic.)
and G. Howitt (S.A.), secured the possible at 200yds.
G. Bradley’s (Q.) aggregate (102 of a possible 105) is the best
compilation in any team match during Bisley’s history.
Sergeant-Major Whitehead (Vic.) scored highest last year
with 101; next came A. Carter (Vic.), 99, and J. T. Lake
(S. A.), 98. Strangely enough, Carter notched 99 again
this time, while his fellow Victorian, W. Ison, put a
similar number together. Of the Australians’ last 16 shots
a year ago 15 were bull’s-eyes. Then Southern Rhodesia
was second, Canada third, and Bull-land fourth. This
time Bull-land was second, Canada third, and Natal
fourth.

“K.” : Champion wrestler, Buttan Singh, is a
hawker, and his beat is in Vic. Western District, where
he runs rather a good turn-out—a big waggonette and
two horses. Buttan, with an eye to business, has
“ Champion Wrestler ” painted on the waggon tilt, and
during the temporary eclipse of his game, after his first
defeat by Gunga Brahm, he had to endure much pointed
satire in connection with the inscription. The wrestler
is a big, heavily-built man, and keeps himself in constant
training by lifting a couple of huge stones that he carts
about in his waggon, and by wrestling with his mate,
who is a fair performer. Early the other morning I saw
Buttan carrying a small tree on his shoulder to replenish
his fire. The tree was a good load for two average men.
Buttan consumes vast quantities of butter, milk, and
mutton when in full training for a contest; and no doubt
the major part of his success is due to the constant and
systematic method in which he prepares himself. By the
way, a countryman of Buttan’s told me that both the late
wrestling matches were fakes, in spite of the apparent
ferocity of Buttan during the last one.

Barring a few barefaced tricks, Kensington
(Sydney) Coursing Club’s three days’ meeting last week,
during which four stakes were run off, supplied good
sport. Victorian-bred Vicar of Wakefield (Goldsmith—
The Witch) gave nothing else a hope in Novice Stakes
General Booth—lnnisfail dog Golden Gate (fresh from
Victorian successes), in Second Trial Stakes, scored with
a deal to the good. Speedy puppy Cannongate romped
away from everything till a broken toe, sustained in the
semi-final, caused his party to suggest a division to
Ohaddesley’s owner; though Cannongate would probably
have won the run-off. Feature of the meeting was that
one absolute winner (Vicar of Wakefield) and two
dividers (litter brothers Cannongate and Crossbow) came
from kennels of ex-Victorian trainer Greg Keighrey, who
has been remarkably successful in Sydney.
* * * *
Failure of officials at Kensington 0. C. to do
the right thing in at least three instances has given the
sport a shock. The cases were very glaring, and one
happening was foreshadowed at card call the previous
evening. Another mistake for which no excuse can he
offered is allowing dogs almost as small as whippets to
start; one competitor last week only scaled 361b5., and
should have been sent baok.

“ David Harum ” : The walking contest craze
has got into the blood of the Adelaide public now, and
the people are as enthusiastic over it as they were over
Sandow developers six months ago. All, ‘from beery
stockbrokers to five year old school-children, are
looking to their legs and wind. Not only have men taken
it up—women, too, are having waddling contests. I have
a young lady friend, who works in a draper’s shop, whom
I take home every night. She is going in for a walking
match, so I have to pace her home. Blank, one of the
portly stockbrokers in our street, goes for a two-mile
walk every morning before breakfast now, and Dash, a
ditto, is also training. Has been living for three weeks
on half his usual allowance of whisky, but tells me he
intends to make up for it after a certain race is over.
Most business men in our district have given up riding
in cars; any morning between 8.30 and 9 one can see
them, each one endeavoring to reach town before the
others. Tramcars are empty save for invalids, cripples,
and women with babies. When I take my girl out
she won’t go to the theatre, or sit down on a seat in
the park—she’ll only walk. Was sitting outside a pub in
the hills last Saturday, and saw a commercial traveller
friend, wearing little more than a silk shirt; come pant-
ing along the road. “ Hullo, Ted,” said I, “ come and
have a drink?” “N-n-n-oo,” he spluttered (it was the
first time I had known him to refuse a drink) “ can’t stop.
I’m in a walking match." He met me a couple of days
after, and reminded me I had asked him to have a drink !
The exercise is good, so is the sport, but not for long—
already bribery is being used.

Advance reports of wonderful physique of M.L.
football forwards haven’t been quite borne out. One or
two are big, powerful chaps, but generally they are of
the compact, speedy class, and range from 12J to 13£st.
M.L. combination in Sydney just now includes
some veterans as far as battles are concerned. Fanning
has a record of 54 provincial battles; Udy, 47 ; Duncan,
45 ; Wallace, 35 ; Armstrong, 33 ; and Stead, 31.

Second M.L.-N.S.W. football rough at Sydney
Cricket Ground (Saturday) was swum under heavy rain
in a lake of mingled mud and water. A greasy ball made
passing a farce, and as M.L. men usually shine in that
department they probably suffered most. Dribbling and
open kicking were all that could be indulged in, though
the tendency to lie down and slide, made even that un-
reliable. Play, if not high class, was certainly amusing—
to the men in the grandstands. Forwards all round
shaped more than capably, and in the scrums N.S.W.
did better than before, but visitors were still slightly
their superiors, playing more concertedly. In the loose
the home combination had the opposition at fault, and
N.S.W. backs were sure at catching and handling, which
was surprising, considering the Maorilander is more
accustomed to slush. N.S.W.’s defence was at least
equal to M.L.’s. It was with the ball at toe the Maori-
landers got to the home goal-line, but N.S.W. picked up
more accurately, and did better at passing, which was,
however, never reliable on either side. Combined
forward rushes and impregnability of defence both ways
proved remarkable under the circumstances, and, in this
connection, Wallace (M.L.) and Maund (N.S.W.), the two
full-backs, did some fine things, with the result that
neither side secured a try—the only score was three in
M.L.’s favor—a penalty goal. Winners were very lucky,
for, as far as actual play went, the match should have
been a draw. Wood (five-eighth) provided a fine game
for M.L., and perhaps (as in the first match) did better
than any other on his side. Contended that visitors
suffered through absence of Duncan and R. M‘Gregor,
but N.S.W. was without Wickham and Finlay, which at
least equalised matters.
* * * *
The necessity of a uniform code of rules was
strongly emphasised at the recent inter-State College
football fixture at Adelaide. Victorian rules allow for
kicking in the ruck, and also kicking out of a player’s
hands—both of which tend to dangerous play. South
Australian rules penalise such modes of play, and,
on the other hand, permit the wearing of gloves on wet
days, which isn’t allowed in Victoria. The visiting Vic-
torian team, therefore, played at a disadvantage in every
way, and didn’t take at all kindly to the adverse condi-
tions of the game.
* * * *
The Amateur Athletic Association of Aus-
tralasia is taking a vote of the whole association on the
question—“ Is an Aboriginal an amateur? ” Really the
question is—“ Will we condescend to compete with
blackfellows ? ” The definition of an amateur is plain
enough, and if the members honestly answer the conun-
drum in its literal sense, it can only have the one
answer, and that is that a black man is an amateur
under the same conditions which make anybody
else an amateur. Whether the blackfellow is to
be allowed to take an equal part in athletic sports
(and the natural objection to our black brudder, notice-
able in one or two well-known cases, is quite understand-
able) is a fair question, but the A.A.A.A. is shirking a
straight-out and honest solution by coolly branding the
abo. as a “ professional ” in its query put to the
plebiscite.
* * * *
Amateur athletics in Sydney are practically
dead. Though the N.S.W.A.A.A. meets frequently and
deliberates solemnly there hasn’t been a blow struck this
season beyond one meeting and an open handicap during
“half time” of first M.L.-N.S.W. football match, both
promoted by North Sydney club. The formation of dis-
trict clubs a year or two since gave the game a fillip
for a while, but enthusiasm and interest petered out
quickly, and things are now moribund. Evidence of
how flattened out the game is was discovered in open
handicap (£m.) referred to. Starters numbered 27, but ere
a quarter mile had been negotiated they dwindled deplor-
ably and presented a depressing spectacle.
* * * *
Patrons of Sydney Cricket Ground are to be
denied in future the added attraction, generally a cycle
or foot race, run at half-time during the football season.
In the interval of the first Maoriland match some two
score half-clad and shivering youths ran a 880-yards’
handicap round and round the arena. To the surprise of
the Athletic Association, which meant to perpetrate a
similar event at the return match, the CrickeD Ground
trustees flatly refused their sanction. Not for propriety’s
sake in the interests of the ladies’ reserve, or for a desire
to prevent the contestants risking pneumonia. Simply
the bar in the members’ stand. Unlike in summer, when
the thirsty pavilionite can, at the termination of an over,
invite his pals to “ Cumanavanother,” the football fol-
lower can only spare the time for a drink during the
lOmin. spell. The bar-tenders lamented loudly at the
first match that the great majority stuck glued to their
seats and speculated not in the bar-coupon. Also was
added the wail from the stands, whence came the reports
that the young men, instead of suggesting tea and
scones, betrayed a sudden and absorbing interest in the
“880,” and their fair companions had perforce to show
an equal anxiety in the chances of the leading ped. in
the shortest of pants and with no singlet to speak of. So
the trustees have decided to err no more in this direction.

The post mortem held on M.L. wrestler Harry
Dunn disclosed a very bad state of things internally. The
operator stated that the stomach was four times the size
of a normal stomach.

Fight between heavyweight pugs—black Felix
(13.6) and woodchopper Bill Heckenberg (13.1)—at
Sydney Gaiety A. 0., Monday night, brought the first big
attendance for months. Sharp on time Heckenberg
landed a left hook that lodged a little too high, other-
wise the match might have ended there and then. The
lathy negro ducked and clung for recuperative purposes
while Heckenberg slashed and lunged—mostly at vacancy,
though occasionally powerful rights narrowly missed
their mark. The pair stood up to each other and fought
vigorously, Felix rarely resorting to footwork, though
’twas anticipated he would take full advantage of the
22ft. square- Excitement was at high pitch, and it looked
either’s fight until, while staggering from the force of
two successive left jabs, the white got a heavy right chop
on the jaw (beautifully timed) that floored him for 9secs.
He would have been beaten then but for “corners.’’
Twice Heckenberg had the colored man rattled, but
Felix’s clever clinging and ducking enabled him to pull
through. Ultimately, as they broke away from a clinch
Felix hurled a right, which landed ’tween chin and cheek-
bone, and the scramble was over—the giant axeman lay
inert and oblivious to the count. Felix made more
friends than ever—not that he has advanced in skill, but
against Heckenberg he evidenced a zest for fight pre-
viously supposed to be foreign to him. Likely that
’Murkan Scanlan and the black may be matched now.

The quality of Westralian pug. material.
Ancient Jim Richardson, who couldn’t make the sem-
blance of a show against Soldier Thompson in Sydney,
squelched Frank Anderson at Her Majesty’s, Kalgoorlie,
recently for W. A. middle supremacy. Thing lasted four
rounds, and Richardson won from the jump. Ten years
ago, before going to S’Africa and the old country,
Richardson might have beaten the best his weight in the
continent, and they were much better then than now.

Bruise between Jim Barr (who cut even with
lightweight champion Bob Turner over a year ago) and
Paddy Martin, at Sydney National S.C. last week, was
bright. Second round was Barr’s, and the third very
much his—Martin dazed and oscillating ; but Paddy came
round soon, and, Barr’s power petering out, things went
against him afterwards till the seventh round closed,
when he gave it best. Martin fought better than for a
long time, but fell weak early—possibly through not
having had too much luxury in the way of living lately,
and want of ways and means to prepare.

There is a little flutter among prominent Can-
terbury (M.L.) bike amateurs, the league, in accordance
with one of its rules, having called upon them to produce
their trophies. These “ much-prized” specimens of metal
ware are usually melted into coin nowadays, but similar
trophies can always be borrowed to satisfy the hungry
gaze of inquisitive league officials.

Entries for the Goulburn to Sydney road-race
closed, yesterday, at the office of the Dunlop Pneumatic
Tyre Company, 150 Clarence-street, Sydney, and the
great interest being taken in this classic road event is
fully demonstrated in the large number of entries
received. Over 100 names have been handed to Mr. E. J.
Branagan, general secretary of the N.S.W. League of
Wheelmen, and the Official Handicapper, Mr. Williams,
has commenced his arduous task of compiling the handi-
caps, which will be published on Thursday, 23rd inst.*
The effectual settlement of the N.S.W. League
■ of Wheelmen dispute is as far off as ever, and, whereas
1 one alleged governing body has granted permission to the
riders who wish to compete in the forthcoming Dunlop
road race, the “ council ” of the League has notified each
rider entered that the race isn’t sanctioned by the
alleged League, and any rider competing in the event
shall be disqualified by an alleged rule for 12 months for
taking part in an alleged unregistered race. The piggish-
ness of each side in refusing to abide by majority rule
renders the matter extremely hard to settle ; and the
outcome seems to be that each side will ultimately run
a separate show, which will either wreck the sport or
cause wheelmen to curse and abjure both parties.

Cable man gave personnel of eight acceptors for
P .F. Warner’s combination to visit Australia, and also
mentioned terms—expenses for amateurs, and ditto for
professionals with £3OO each added for latter and a bonus
should profit result. Promoting Marylebone 0.0. wants
to make nothing out of the venture. Hirst, Rhodes,
Arnold, and Braund, with Bosanquet, Fielder and Relf to
help, are among the possibles.
* * * *
Good judges have always doubted whether
Rhodes, who needs a wicket to help him, would do much
good in Australia ; but, now that he is at last coming, he
seems to be losing even his English form. Up to the
middle of June, with an unusually wet season, his average
of 21 per wicket did not put him in the first 30 on the
bowling list. Braund was even lower down. The first
four were Hirst (21 for 8 apiece !), Hargreave (51 for 11),
Blythe and J. T. Hearne. Fry, Jessop, John Gunn,
Perrin and Dowson headed the batting averages, ranging
from 76 to 56.

How the pigeon murderers prosper ! N.S.W.
Gun Club has just bought its Botany grounds for £lOOO,
and yet shows a credit balance of over £5OO on the year's
business.
It is generally understood—principally on the
strength of a vague scare got up by the S.M.
Herald and the Telegraph— that N.S.W. is at
present losing population by exoess of departures
over arrivals. On this subject, the Telegraph
announced last Monday :
Never before in the history of N.S.W. has the emigra-
tion exceeded the influx of people.
This, it is needless to say, is the Telegraph’s
usual lie, designed presumably to imply that this
sort of thing only happens under Federation. In
1893,1895, 1896, 1897, 1900 and 1901 N.S.W. lost
population by excess of departures. The figures
appear on page 536 of Coghlan’s latest issue of
the “ Seven Colonies,” and are so well known that
the Telegraph’s statement looks like premedi-
tated inaccuracy.
The Bulletin received an invitation the other
day from Messrs. Swift and Company to call and taste the
1898 vintage champagne of M. Charles Heidsieck. The
result was so eminently satisfactory, that the moderate
drinkers of this paper hope to have the same invitation
regularly once a month at least; the oftener, the better.*
How strongly Kingston has impressed his
personality on public and press is shown by the
appreciations of his work everywhere volunteered.
It is as though the man were just dead, instead of
being still a living, fighting force. Probably the
finest “notice” he got was from a man of dia-
metrically opposite way of political thought—
Scarlett, Yic. Chamber of Manufactures’ Presi-
dent: “He is not a man to move hurriedly.
He waits always until he fully understands the
matter before him, then his decisions are rapid
and final. He is a man of indomitable will-power,
yet withal very gentle. He is a still, .strong
man. ... As first Federal Customs Minister
the work before him was enormous, and he knew
no more about it than the ordinary man outside.
But he was not daunted,... and soon made himself
master of all the details. . . . Even his severest
critic must say that lie tried to do everything for
the best, and that he at least treated all alike.
He has done the lion’s share of the work of
the department, and it will be a comparatively
easy matter now to conduct its affairs since he
has started the machinery, got it going, and
made a deep groove for his successor to drop
into.” And his subordinates are equally appre-
ciative. He made them work, but he never
spared himself; and for their blunders his
treatment was- ever more generous than just.
Things should sort themselves out shortly, at the
elections if not before ; and the right billet will
then be open to Kingston—that of Prime Minister
and leader of the Australian Democratic party.
THE WALKING MATCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ The clerks of have arranged for a walking
match.” —News item in any paper.
The outward course was ten short miles,
And then ten long miles back ;
And ten short clerks and ten long clerks
Stood ready on the track.
And Robert Jinks, of Jones and Co.,
The favorite was he;
And when the signal came he took
The front place manfully.
And when they dipped beneath the hill
His friends remarked with pride,
How Robert Jinks increased his lead
With every mighty stride.
And when they passed the flve-mile post,
Although-with main-and might
The others walked, they saw with grief
That Jinks was out of sight.
And when the clerks had all come home,
The crowd upon the flat
Saw X. Y. Jones, of Jones and Co.,
A-leaping on his hat.
For Robert Jinks had not returned,
He’s somewhere walking yet;
If you can tell his whereabouts
A good reward you’ll get.
And X. Y. Jones, of Jones and Co.,
Whose business has gone smash,
Would like to meet with Robert Jinks
Who walked off with his cash.

The only modification so far secured of
the Naval Tribute Bill and its accompanying
arrangements is the withdrawal of the proposal
that the poor little vessels which Australia already
owns shall be sold. Practically, the effect of
this is slight—the boats are almost useless. Sen-
timentally, it is important, for Premier Barton
has been forced to admit that Australia can own
warships of its own; and though they are poor
ones now they may be better later on when a
Premier is in power who has not succumbed to
the fascinations of Joseph of Birmingham.

J. L. Dow (Vic.) writes :
A sore-headed friend of The Bulletin, recently, is not
pleased with my accounts in the Age of the new wheat-
growing development in the Victorian Western district.
Nevertheless, it is quite true that several hundreds of
sturdy wheat-growers, who have been driven out of the
drought-stricken Mallee, are down there growing big
crops, and, for the privilege of doing so, paying the land-
lords up to 10s. per acre per annum rental. The monopoly
that enables these landowners to extract this charge from
needy workers was conferred upon them by previous
selectors, who conveyed their lands to them for a con-
sideration. Of course, dummies and land-pimps, who
take up selections under liberal land laws for the purpose
of selling to the squatter, don’t grow crops. That’s not
their business.
The point of the above isn’t very clear. If Mr.
Dow means that because the Western Victoria
landlords built up big estates by buying out a
dead generation of selectors, and have proved by
their rapacity that they shouldn’t have been
allowed to do so, therefore no one should complain
of their rapacity, or object to the landlord system,
or object to the glorification of the landlord
system, or try to undo the evil that has been
done—well, if Mr. Dow means that, it would be
better to say so as clearly as possible.

Recently the unemployed at Hillston
(N.S.W.) refused to accept charity from the State
and demanded relief works instead. Well, the
two are practically the same thing, and it is time
that the fact was recognised. Relief works, when
they become chronic, as they are in Australia, are
simply charity, thinly disguised by the pretence
of doing something useless which is paid for out
of loans. Calling them relief works gives the
State an excuse for not paying the bill out of
revenue ; also it lends a bogus dignity to the busi-
ness which prevents the public being so thoroughly
ashamed of it as it should be ; and it prevents the
pauper statistics showing the real state of the
country. The facts of the case are that there are
.1,400,000 people in N.S.W. and only legitimate
employment enough to support about 1,200,000;
that unless we start to manufacture about
£5,000,000 or £10,000,000 worth per annum of the
goods we now import there isn’t likely to be any
more employment; and that N.S.W. is now one
of the most pauperised countries on earth, only
its pauperism is mostly called “the judicious
use of loan money to develop the mag-
nificent natural resources of the country.” The
remaining fact is that N.5.W.,. by persistently;
voting for Freetrade and lots of imports, which
retard local manufactures, and for big loans, has
brought these results on itself.

Sozne people seem to live to make work
for lawyers. A man at Kadina (S.A.) has been
invoking the Supreme Court to look into his case.
He was sued at Port Broughton, some miles
away, for an alleged debt, and objected on the
ground that his own local court at Kadina was
the proper place to try the action. The magis-
trates “ passed ” on this point, and gave a verdict
for plaintiff. Defendant journeyed to Adelaide,
went before a judge (with counsel), and obtained
a stay of proceedings for 14 days. Having got it,
he slept on it peacefully for a month or so, till
the bailiffs came in in pursuance of the verdict,
only to retire on finding no goods distrainable.
Then this enthusiast went before the Pull Court
(with counsel on both sides) to ask for an order
to prohibit the local court from doing what it had
already done! And when the three judges
solemnly assembled found that the amount
originally in dispute was £4 7s. 7d, they talked
very candidly to him and to his lawyer, and
talked still more frankly on hearing of the bailiffs
official report that the litigant wasn’t worth even
that sum. The civil law has no great fondness
for a man who can’t find £4 7s. 7d. to pay for the
excitement he gets out of it. The criminal law is
more democratic. It would cheerfully hang a
man even if he hadn’t 2d.

Some precedents to support the Australian Par-
liament in its insistence on white labor conditions
oh mail vessels which it subsidises, and to suggest
to it Protection for the Australian seaman in the
forthcoming Navigation Act:
The British Navigation Act of 1845 (since unwisely
repealed) provided that British vessels must be navigated
by a British master, and that, in the case of sea-going
vessels at least three-fourths, and in the case of coastal
vessels all, of the crews must be British.
The United States shipping law of the present day pro-
vides, that every officer who has charge of a watch must
be a U.S. citizen.
The French shipping law enacts that on board a French
vessel all the officers and at least three-fourths of the
crew must be French.
The Italian shipping law states that on an Italian vessel
the master and at least two-thirds of the crew must be
Italians.
The Swedish and Norwegian law is that on a Scandi-
navian vessel the master, the mate and three-fourths of
the crew must be Scandinavians.

Emulsion herself, gave it to me. The result
was remarkable. It at once relieved my chest,
eased my cough, stopped the spitting of blood,
increased my weight considerably, and even-
tually restored me entirely to good health.
I used to suffer greatly from sore throat and
colds ; now I find my throat quite strong, as
my system has been built up so thoroughly
by Scott’s Emulsion. Faithfully yours,

HOW CAN YOU MISTAKE
THE SIGNS? It is a very vital thing
to you that you should hot mistake the signs,
and how can you mistake the signs when you
have such evidence before you as is related in
the above letter ? On the slightest suggestion
of symptoms so severe as these, or even if you
have only a bad throat and cold ; send at once
for Scott's Emulsion. It is the thing of all
things that you need at such a juncture and
is exactly what will restore you to your
normal health. Do not forget what you need
is
SCOTT’S EMULSION. There can
be no doubt about it. What has just been re-
lated has been the common experience of
people in all parts of the world who have
taken Scott’s Emulsion, and naturally the
same experience is being repeated here among
those who have known, the name of the proper
reimdy—Scott’s Emulsion. Scott’s Emulsion
has always and always will cure. You have
only one condition to observe ; and that is to
see that on the wrapper of the bottle there is
a picture of a man carrying a big cod-fish ; if
that cod-fish is not there, you are not getting
what we promised you—a cure ! You can
obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion and the
choicest children’s booklet of the year—“A
Bunch of Roses,” —beautifully printed in
colors, by sending sd. to Scott and Bowne,

Adulteration.
When any Australian State attempts to legislate
against the adulteration of drink or foodstuffs
such an outcry is raised by vendors that if a Bill
passes it soon becomes inoperative. Indeed, not-
withstanding hysterical attempts at repression, it
is questionable if any State is capable of effectu
ally saving consumers from fraudulent vendors,
and in the interest of the public at large the
Commonwealth Parliament should be urged to
move in the matter on uniform lines. The French
Senate has just.adopted a Bill against fraudulent
vendors which is a model worth serious considera-
tion. A few articles run :
Article I.—For deceiving, or attempting to deceive,
the. purchaser, either as to the nature, quality, com-
position, etc., of the various products, the vendor shall
be liable to imprisonment, the minimum term being
three months and the maximum one year, along with
a fine ranging from £4 to £2OO. Article 2.—The term of
imprisonment may be extended to two years if the
offences set forth in Article 1 be committed by the aid of
false or inexact weights, measures, or other instruments
used with intent to defraud. Article 3.—The penalties
stipulated in Article 1 will be imposed upon (1) those
found guilty of adulterating the provisions intended for
either man or beast, etc., and (2) those who expose for
sale foodstuffs knowing them to be adulterated. In the
event, however, of the adulterated substance being
injurious to health, imprisonment will be compulsory
(the term being from three months to two years),
together with a fine of £2O to £4OO. Article 4.—A 'fine of
£2 to £l2O, or imprisonment of from six days to three
months, will be imposed upon any person found to
possess, without a legitimate reason, upon his shop,
workshop, business premises, etc., any false weights
or measures or other inaccurate apparatus used in
connection with merchandise.
That is not harsh. It is just. Less than that
plays into the .hands of fraud. A twopenny-
ha’penny fine is laughed at by the systematic-
defrauder ; the illicit profit on the output which
has caused the fine pays it many times over.
Imprisonment, if not for the first offence, should
certainly follow the second. The reason why the
Commonwealth Parliament should deal with this
matter is that it is the only Parliament which can
legislate for all Australia; which can shut out
imports of adulterated woollens that are cotton,
and adulterated tweed that is shoddy, and
adulterated silk that is largely mineral; and it is
the only Legislature which can protect one State
effectively against the influx of adulterated goods
from another, by pursuing the local adulterator
to the farthest ends of the Commonwealth.
♦
Thebe is an urgent need in the Commonwealth
of an Association for Minding One’s Own Busi-
ness. The worst—but by no means the only-
offender against the one essential rule of the
Association is the common or incompetent muni-
cipal councillor. He has already a vast quantity
of work set before him. He is supposed to see
that his district is kept clean and wholesome ; to
look after food adulteration, weights and measures;
to levy sufficient rates to keep his council solvent;
in fact, he is supposed—and elected —to do a num-
ber of things that he hasn’t the least intention or
idea of doing; but one thing that he is not
elected to do is to interfere in Federal or State
politics. Another frequent offender in this re-
spect is the average member of a Chamber of
Commerce. Melbourne Age lately urged this per-
son to do a little of the work he reckons it is his
Divine mission to leave undone, and a few days
later even his own pet Akgus directed his atten-
tion to the trader’s pleasing habit of selling 12oz.
of candles and other articles as a pound. This was
pre-eminently a matter for the Chambers of
Commerce to deal with—else what are they for?
But, up to date, the commercial person’s time has
been fully occupied by weird dissertations on the
extravagance of a High Court and plaintive regrets
that, there should be any such horror as Industrial
Arbitration. So far the school boards haven’t
given their official opinions on Federal politics;
nor have the cemetery trusts published any notes
on the foreign policy of the Hempire, but they
only need a very little encouragement to start
them on their wild career.
Pbemibr Dick Seddon, of Maoriland, threatens
to take the first backward step from his old policy
of trusting the people, and what the results will
be it is hard to say, but the chances are that they
will be disastrous. It was the Seddon party which
gave every adult the franchise, and the people
promptly set to work to use it as an instrument
for the destruction of the liquor traffic. In some
places prohibition was carried; in many other
places reduction was carried. Also, in a multi-
tude of places where prohibition was not
carried, the Prohibition party was strong
enough to elect teetotal Licensing Committees,
which administer the laws regulating public-
houses with all the rigor these laws admit
of, and order the abolition of barmaids, counter-
lunches, and other frills. A considerable public-
house interest has always been behind Seddon,
and Seddon is a perplexed man. He says the
Licensing law is being administered in a way that
was never intended, which seems a sadly futile
argument, for the teetotal committees are keeping
within the letter of the statute, and are adminis-
tering the people’s law strictly as the people
direct.. If the people direct them to administer it
for all it is worth, that seems to be the people’s
affair. But Seddon, in his disgust, is said to con-
template disfranchising the whole community in
one act as far as concerns its right to elect Licensing
Committees, and entrusting licensing business to
the nominee magistrates. There, in all proba-
bility, Seddon will fall in. He got his power by
enfranchising the people. If he starts to disfran-
chise the people anything may happen to him.

An interesting and timely item from the report of
a British Naval Committee:
There should always be an effective reserve squadron,
absolutely confined to home waters, sufficient to hold the
Channel and protect the coasts and commerce of the
United Kingdom, in addition to the coast defence ships
which would be required for active local defence.
From this it will be seen that British naval
authorities have no intention of taking the medi-
cine they offer us. All the available jeer-power
of every Jingo hereabouts is directed at the idea
of Australia proposing to keep a fleet for purely
local defence. The thing, we are told, is foolish,
impracticable and opposed to all naval science ;
what we want is a fleet that will go and hunt for
the enemy, and if the enemy dodges him, said
enemy can burn Sydney and Melbourne
to the ground before the fleet finds out
its mistake and comes back. But Britain
sticks closely to the policy of keeping a coast
defence fleet always on hand to protect its
Eqrts. Sydney and Melbourne don’t matter, but
liverpool and Cardiff matter a great deal, and the
chances that are good enough for us are not good
enough for Britain —not by a long way. The dis-
crepancy calls for inquiry. Premier Barton’s
proposals go dead against British precedent, and
it is disrespectful to kick British precedent in
the mud as Barton is doing.
KIDNEYS. LIVER.
The Cause of Rheumatism, Gout, Lumbago,
Sciatica, Neuralgia, Blood Disorders,
Gravel, Bladder Disorders, Indigestion,
Biliousness, Sick Headache, Anaemia.
HOW TO EFFECT A PERMANENT CURE.
The Kidneys. —Blood is conveyed from the heart to the kidneys through arteries, and it is the
function of the kidneys to filter the blood, and otherwise separate from it water and various im-
purities. These impurities are urea, uric acid, and mineral matter. When the kidneys have done
their work of purification, the blood enters the veins and traverses the body, accumulating, in its
course, a fresh supply of effete matter produced by the wasting of the tissues. The heart again
delivers the blood to the kidneys, and the process is repeated. Night and day the work of the
kidneys goes on without ceasing.
When the kidneys, through weakness or disease, are unable to perform their duty efficiently,
the blood retains the uric acid and urea which would otherwise be removed, and becomes con-
taminated by these urinary poisons. Nature’s method of letting us know that the kidneys are
working indifferently is to make us conscious of the presence of these poisons by causing us to
suffer from Rheumatism, Gout, Lumbago, Sciatica, Neuralgia. Blood Disorders,
Gravel, Stone or Bladder Troubles. The commonest first symptom is a
PAIN IN THE BACK.
but it is not necessary to wait for this acute signal. If some urine, passed the first thing in the
morning, is placed in a covered glass and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours and is then cloudy,
shows a sediment like brick dust, is an unnatural colour, or has particles floating about in it, then the
kidneys are weak or diseased, and immediate steps must be taken to restore them to health and
activity.
The Stiver.—The health of the liver and of the kidneys is closely connected. It is almost impossible
for the kidneys to be affected and the liver to remain healthy, or vice versa. The liver is an automatic
chemical laboratory. In the liver various substances are actually made from the blood. Two or
three pounds of bile are thus made by the liver every day. The liver takes sugar from the blood, con-
verts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it to the blood, gradually,
as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble, into urea, which is
completely soluble, and the liver also deals with the blood corpuscles, which have lived their life and
are useful no longer.
When the liver is inactive or diseased, we suffer from Indigestion, Biliousness, Anaemia,
Sick Headache, and Blood Disorders, because the blood is laden with urinary and biliary
poisons to such an extent that it cannot absorb nutriment from the food we eat, red corpuscles are no
longer formed, and it is these red corpuscles which nourish the nerves. In other words the blood is
vitiated and starved.
The importance of keeping the kidneys and liver in vigorous health will therefore be realised,
and an explanation is afforded why
Warner’s Safe Cure
possesses such wonderful power in curing so many seemingly different disorders as those mentioned.
Warner’s Safe Cure possesses the remarkable property of being able to restore the kidneys and liver
to health and activity. All urinary and biliary poisons are then duly removed by the simple process
of Nature and all suffering due to the presence of these poisons in the system necessarily ceases.
Mr. JEt. H. Blackman, 32 Greek Street, Glebe, Sydney, says About seven years ago I was
suffering from Gout, and was suddenly seized by Sciatica, which attacked me as I was driving, and
the pain became so bad that I had to be carried home. I was advised the next morning to take
Warner’s Safe Cure. After taking a few doses I felt relief, and after taking one or two bottles was
cured altogether.”
Mr. A. Newcombe, of 53 Arden Street, North Melbourne, says : —“ For several years I was a
martyr to periodical attacks of Indigestion. Eating became almost a terror to me. The attacks became
more frequent as time went on. I tried various remedies, but derived no benefit from any of them.
Having heard a good deal about Warner’s Safe Cure, I took some of that medicine, together with
Warner’s Safe Pills, and was quite cured. I have not had an attack now for many months.”

remarkable cures effected, will be sent free on application by H. H. Warner and Co., Limited,

This gorgeous Sydney monopoly tramps through the
years on two unequal legs—the long December leg and
the short June leg. Apparently there has been a shrink-
age in profits ; but, as a matter of fact, the profits for an
off” half were never so large. The paid-up capital is
now £750,000, or £68,202 more than it used to be ; and
there must be an extra average profit of £5115 per half-
year in order to pay the 15 per cent, dividend. For the
last two years before the capital was increased the half-
yearly average profit was £51,425 ; for the last year,
£56,624, or £5199 more, so that the extra capital appears
to be just earning the 15 per cent, and a shadow over.
Besides the reserves mentioned above, there is another
£7953 in the shape of a reserve for the replacement of
meters.

The net profit (that is, the gross profit less allowance for
depreciation) for the last half-year was £57,661 as against
£54,755 in the previous half-year, and £47,941 in the
corresponding half of ’O2. The average net price realised
for silver (fine) during the last six months was a shade
over 2s. o£d. per oz., and for lead £lO 11s. 2d. per ton.
The gross profit was thus equal to £2 Bs. Bd. per ton of
lead. In other words,.with silver at the price averaged
during the half-year (it is now somewhat higher), lead
could fall to £8 2s. 6d. before the co. would be out of
pocket. During the last two years very striking
economies have been made; not only have costs
been reduced, but recoveries have been greatlv improved
In the half-year to May, 1901, silver was 2s. 6|d. and lead
£l3 2s. 9d., and the profit was £102,505. If silver had
been 2s. o£d. (the average of the past half-year) the profit
would have been only £27,276, or at the rate of 19s. 8d
per ton of lead. That means that, if the methods which
prevailed down to two years ago had been continued,
lead could only have been produced last half-year at a
cost of £l2 3s. Id.; and the co. on its output would have
lost £50,000 instead of making £BO,OOO. The economies
have been spread practically over the entire range of the
co s. operations, but the most important have been in
connection with the desulphurising of ores, local produc-
tion of coke, and the sintering of slimes. At the present
rate of extraction, seven years’ supply of ore is developed

800 ft. in the third. The co’s. surplus of liquid assets o\ er

“Late Menzies Resident” writes: Par in B.
(20/6/’O3) anent the Lady Shenton, is another instance of
a mine being libelled to cover up blunders. Properly
worked, mine should have paid £50,000 or £60,000 more in
dividends in the two or three years past. Worse than the
disastrous blundering so well-known locally in connection
with this good little mine, is the oft-repeated and widely-
circulated covering-up lie about "patchy ore-bodies”
and "necessarily expensive conditions,” as capital has
thereby been scared from a valuable district, and many
promising ventures left unworked. Employees freely
assert that shaft, sunk to hit the reef at 450 ft., and now
down 650 ft., being located in a large “ break,” was fore-
doomed to failure. Borehole to 1000 ft. is officially reported
barren of results, so continued sinking promise's more for
the management (at about £l5OO a year) than for the co
or the credit of the district. As regards “obsolete
machinery ’’—that is a cute cry to excuse a record for
poor milling (1300 tons monthly with 35 stamps)
As a matter of fact, mine is hard to beat for quality and
up-to-dateness of equipment.

Golden Link, Kalgoorlie (W.A.), continues to
do very well on its Eclipse lease. The ore body is so
wide that the manager estimates the reserves already
opened up above 100 ft. at 40,000 tons of 12dwt. ore The
200 ft. level is now being driven, and may possibly double
the estimate. Instead of merely adding five-head to the
existing mill it is now contemplated to double it. June
return of 2177 tons for 16400 z., worth £6692, leaves a
margin of well on for £4OOO, as costs are very low On the
Golden Link lease driving at the 1300 ft. level shows that
the L. V. Consols and Perseverance lodes junction about
280 ft. south of the shaft. At this point the ore is 18ft
wide, and worth 18dwt. The 1400 ft. level has just been
commenced.

The New Moon Co., the parent of the Bendigo
group which just now provides Victoria with its boss
gold-mine, completed its most successful half-year on
June 30. On a revenue of £32,458 it made a profit of
£21,967, after allowing £B6O for wear and tear of plant
Of every £1 of gold won 13s. 6d. was profit. In dividends
during the past 5J years it has paid £ll4,ooo—on a paid-
up capital of £11,560, of which only £4200 is represented
by the paid-up capital in the present co. (the old co
tasted from 1870 to 1886). Up to a few months ago the
co did not trouble about a reserve fund, but it has now
made a start to build one up; though, as the directors
have an idea of using it “ for renewing machinery ” it
will probably >»t be there when it is most needed. ’

Extract from a pessimistic letter written by a
miner on the Tarnagulla (Vic.) rush : “ We have done no
good since we got that l£oz. piece. Our dirt has only
averaged about ldwt. to the load. We are sinking a new
shaft- expect to bottom this week. It is a very patchy
Elace. The newspaper reports are grossly exaggerated,
ut it is no use contradicting them—they won’tTpublish
contradictions. It has been raining heavily, and the
rush is in a nice mess. The carters can’t cart the wash-
dirt, so all hands are stacking it. I refused £2O for my
share in claim some time ago—would be inclined to take
it now.”

Glenfine South (Pitfield, Vic.) finished a poor
half-year on June 30 ; 14,450 tons stone gave 32960 z., an
average of only 4dwt. 13Jgr., worth £12,975. Concen-
trates added £1144, and crushing £2O, making a total of
£14,139. Expenses were £13,654, leaving a profit of
£485. The dividend of £1750 which was paid was, there-
fore, not earned. Moreover, whereas the first crushing
for the half-year gave 6dwt. llgr., the last gave only
3dwt. Bgr.; and the manager can only see six months’
supply of stone of the lower value available. The co.,
which has paid £65,625 in dividends, has a cash balance
of £lO4O after meeting current liabilities.
At Poverty Point.
MU. E. NAPOLEON BOFFARD, heralding Australia amongst the Nations at the Alfred
Hospital Ball, recently held in Melbourne.
Hypocrisy is an understudy o 1 Virtue, and replaces her
in the second act.
An English hospital committee, deciding to raise funds
fora “charity concert,” carried out the entertainment in
a brilliantly original fashion. Tickets were printed, in
value from 6d. to 2s. 6d.,and the charitable urged to
buy with the assurance that they need not attend the
concert, for there would be none. Tickets went like wild-
fire, and there was no scandal as to the huge bite that
expenses made in receipts.
The distressful fact that Cecil Ward has to wear a
neatly-parted top-piece to preserve the continuity of his
hair and his place among juveniles came to light during
a performance of “ Are You a Mason ?” at Napier (M.L.)
recently. Desmond, the giddy youth of the piece, in-
advertently shifted the hirsute roof and exposed the
place where the dome of thought had climbed through
Its covering.
“ T.D.” : Hugh Ward should have an uncommonly fine
show in London, his versatility giving him a great pull
over the average one-rut man. Ward only evidenced a
little of his cleverness as a legitimate actor when he
made his small part in “ Arizona ” stand right out of the
ruck. Also, Ward’s wife, who sings as Miss Grace Millar
Ward, has a voice far above the mere utility work that
nowadays falls to Melbourne' singers, and she would have
been heard more often but for the fact that fees are too
small in these parts. If she takes up concert work in
London there should be plenty of room for her.
“ K. 0.” : The large and enthusiastic audience at Mar-
shall Hall’s last concert may have the effect of reducing
the deficit left from the last, as tariffs were raised all over
the hall. In any case, the work partakes largely of phil-
anthropy. When all exes, are paid, the salary of each
member of the big orchestra works out at exactly 7jd. an
hour. The practising is a very thorough business —all the
different instruments are taken many times in sections
before the whole band is assembled, and there are frcm
eight to a dozen full rehearsals. The long, bony con-
ductor gets nothing out of it but kudos.
Robert Courtneidge, when he was in Melbourne looking
after the Shakespeare shows, talked interestingly about
Australian, as compared with English, stage troubles.
The average Australian novice actor suffers from a
neglected accent and a combative self-sufficiency which
go to make him unteachable. But the occasional earnest
striver shows a quicker intelligence than the average
teachable young Britisher. Stage hands are more alert
and generally useful than the men in the Cold Country.
Comparing the productions of the same heavy shows in
Manchester and Melbourne, Courtneidge found that the
scenes here were set by fewer hands in rather better time.
“ 0.K.” : Probably the foreign accent of Rudinoff is a
big factor in his personal magnetism, and the magnetism,
there can be no doubt, is the whole secret of his success.
He does nothing that is remarkably clever ; nevertheless
the Melbourne and Sydney public in turn have —about
90 percent, of them—been bluffed into a lively admiia*
tion for the tall, shapely, lime-lighted showman. Ihe
man, the manner, and the accent combine to do the
trick, whilst people in front think they are impressed by
the cleverness of one “smoke” picture and three or four
lightning sketches (always the same), a whistle, a third-
rate baritone warble, some ordinary shadowgraph work,
and some very ordinary patter. Rudinoff can talk
English without his stage-accent, and when he drops
that effective disguise he would pass.for a Cockney of
Polish Jew parentage. All the same, he has been quite
as popular a foreign artist in London as he now is in
Australia. Another man offering the same entertain-

Thomas Bent was busy promising railways
in the Mallee when the news of his downfall as
Victorian Minister of Railways reached him;
just as he had undertaken to build a line to Went-
worth, some bitter cuss handed him a paper which
mentioned that the broad man was sacked. The
Agk, which, a short time ago, devoted a three-
column biographical sketch to Bent, with a por-
trait in the Leader thrown in, now scoffs like
this : “ While he was promising a railway to the
mosquito-ridden country of Wentworth, he had
ceased to reign at the Railways, and the crown
was borne by the aspiring William of Norman by.’'

City Improvements.
The extensive premises at the corner of Eliza-
beth and Bathurst-streets, known as The Freeman
and Wallace Electro-Medical and Surgical Insti-
tute, are at present undergoing a conspicuous
change in their interior and exterior aspects. The
adjoining premises have been secured by the firm
as an addition to the Institute for correspondence
and electric bath purposes, and at present a large
number of tradesmen are busy renovating and
fitting the various chambers with the most com-
plete and scientific systems of electric bathing
obtainable in Europe. The new premises will be
opened shortly for public inspection and patron-
age. Visitors from the country would do well
when in town to pay a visit to this famous Insti-
tute ; the Specialists of which are amongst the
most famous practitioners in the spheres of grave
nerve and blood diseases afflicting humanity.*

The proposition to appoint, con equent on
Kingston’s resignation, Langdon Bunython to
an honorary portfolio in the Australian Ministry
is an instance that provincialism has not yet died
out in Australian politics. The sole reason
advanced why Langdon should be, selected is
that his appointment would be “a compliment to
South Australia.” The idea is that each State
wants one man in the Government, which is a silly
idea anyhow. In a State Government no one
bothers . because the S.S.W. and £ W., corner
has not a representative in the State Cabinet, and
why should not the same rule hold good all round.
Speaking at an A.N.A. banquet the other
evening, Yic. State Premier Irvine complained
bitterly that under Federation the people, of the
State were taxed through the. Customs but only
received back a portion of the money taken from
them; the rest being squandered in Federal
extravagance. And no one called him an im-
pudent and malicious slanderer. It is time
Federal politicians took a turn at criticising State
Governments, and complained of the people being
taxed through the Federal Customs for the benefit
of the extravagant State administrations. State
extravagance is ruining the country, and what is
wanted is an extension of the present thrifty,
careful Commonwealth management. Men like
Irvine and Philp are spending too much good
Commonwealth revenue on, Kanaka employers
and wealthy farmers and other rampant paupers.

the chapters enumerated below will show the magnificence of this work, and prove that it is no
mere pamphlet as is used for advertising purposes. Ib is a boon to any reader.

A Few Valuable
Press Notices.
Kalgoorlie ' “ SUN ” : “ ‘CLINICAL
EXPERIENCES’ contains much valuable
information written in a popularmanner.”
Adelaide “OBSERVER”: “There
has never been published of its kind in
Australia a more worthy addition to the
literature of the colony.”
Hobart “MERCURY” : "It is an ele-
gantly-bound volume. Over 20,000 ...
copies are issued yearly.”
Brisbane “WORKER” : “Almost
every disease which flesh is heir to has
been treated within the pages of this
work.” • j
“ NEW ZEALAND MAIL” :“ In this
book the authors give us much that is
instructive from a physical health view-
point.”
“SUNDAY TIMEB,” Perth,in “Bits
about Books,” on March 29, 1903, says
“•CLINICAL EXPERIENCES’ on,
General Diseases is splendidly coinpiled.
;It would be hard to overrate its value,
nor do we ever remember to have seen a
more creditable production or one that
merits a more appreciative press notice.” i
Auckland “ OBSERVER ”: “ A high- i
ly interesting volume. It deals with
nerve complaints and how to cure them.” 1
“GOLDEN FLEECE,” Sydney:
“The volume conducts humanity from i
the cradle to the grave.”
“FREE LANCE,” Wellington:
“ Nerve diseases and a thousand and
one ills arising from them are exhaust-
ively described.”
“ FEDERAL PABTORALIBT ”
“ The medical illustrations show the per-
fection of illustrative excellence.”
“ PUNCH," Melbourne: “ Any suf-
ferer interested in a medically diagnosed
incurable disease should write to the
Specialists of the Institute.”
Bendigo “INDEPENDENT”:'
“ Amongst the leading Medical Institutes
of the world, the Freeman and Wallace
Institute holds a position of high signifi-
cance."
These are bat a few of
some hundreds of reviews
given by the leading weekly
and daily journals In the Com-
monwealth of Australasia.
SPECIAL ATTENTION is drawn to the chapter upon Electricity and its appli-
cation to the human nerve system by the use of
The FREEMAN & WALLACE ELECTRIC “ INVICORATOR” BELT.
I Ins treatment is fully described and illustrated, and its uses explained. It is a genuine
electric Belt, as is now in use amongst English Scientists, who recognise that an even
current of medical electricityi nfused into the chief nerve centres governing the stomach and
kidneys is a certain relief in cases of physical “ weakness ” and general breakdown.
THIS “ INVICORATOR ” IS SOLD FOR £1 ONLY.
It is superior to any electric instrument used in medical practice in Australia. A perusal of
this chapter re testimonies of cure from leading persons, and the certificates of test of; this
medical BELT’ given by leading members of the electrical world of Sydney, will be instruc-
tive. Worn round the waist for a few hours nightly, the greatest forms of nerve diseases
classed as incurable are permanently relieved. It has often cured where doctors have
signally failed.
Beware of persons advertising our “ INVIGORATOR ” Belts at TEN SHILLINGS,
and write to us at once for full explanation and particulars.
No man or woman should wear an Electric “Belt” until they have read in this
book the probable effect of Electricity upon them. They should be certain it does
not aggravate their disease and render a cure impossible as has been proved in
many instances.
THERE WILL BE FOUND AN APPENDIX OF 173 PACES.
further illustrated, which will be found of interest, containing articles upon correspondence to the
Specialists in Foreign Languages (in French, German, or Italian), Burns and Scalds, Poisoned
Wounds, Sick Room Management, Children and their Illnesses, the Sickness of Old Age, &c.
A LIST OF £0 VALUABLE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR HOME USE
containing many useful remedies of well-known efficacy are included. A chapter upon
Poisons and their Antidotes, an illustrated chapter of personal testimonials, and 'a vocabulary
of 1000 medical terms, indispensable to the reader unenlightened in the details of physiology
and anatomy is instructive; The reader’s attention is also drawn to the five full-page illustra-
tions of the modes of wearing an Electric Belt by either sex. Each plate is explained, as well
as the mechanism of the “ IN VIGOR ATOR,” which is constructed on scientific principles.
This magnificent work can be obtained as a Splendid Presentation Volume. After you have read it, lend it to
your friends. It will be forwarded to any address in Australia for Fivepence only, in stamps, to cover postage. This
is the Cheapest and Most Instructive Medical Work ever offered to the Australian public. Remember—All patients are
under the care of Dr. R. Wallace, M.D., who is registered by Australian, English, and American Medical Boards.

“ Ilex ” : Why get unhappy because the
standard height for admission to the British army
was lowered to sft. ? Also, does the fact really
indicate British physical degeneracy in toto, or
only royal physical degeneracy? How do you
suppose that Mighty Atom, the Booklet of Corn-
york, was to get his billet in the army with the
standard admission height at sft. Bin. ? Standards
must be adapted to circumstances. Wasn’t the
British standard “yard ” once determined by the
length of the king’s arm ? [But they don’t reduce
the standard height of the private even if the
honorary general is stumpy; any more than they
cut the campaign short because the king is
short-winded.J
N.S.W. Importer and M.P., David Storey,
at a farewell meeting, moaning over the harsh
law which punishes the forged entry and the
faked invoice:
Some of those who ranked as their best citizens were
not only discouraged after long years of valuable service
to commerce and trade, but were persecuted in such a
way as to keep them in perpetual anxiety. That was
scarcely the treatment which should be accorded public-
spirited, honorable men. It found no precedent in the
land of their forefathers where the flag: of freedom still
proudly waved.
Importers object to be reckoned dishonest as a
class, but can they wonder when they are so free
m their public expressions of sympathy for
swindlers who have been found out ?

Mr. W. O. Hearne.—Dear Sir, —I am writing to tell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three year* ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at onoe, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
>f medicine you sent have effeoted a complete cure, for
)hich accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,

Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, l was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am

CURED BY HEARNE'S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows:—“As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronohitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,

Asthma.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
A SEVENTEEN YEARS’ CASE.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, writes “After suffering from Asthma for
17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to tryHearne’s
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then,
which was in the beginning of 1883— 15 years ago—l have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.”
Writing again on the 4th April, 1899, he states:—“l
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightest
return of the Asthma.”

BILIOUSNESS, INDIGESTION, and HEADAGHE
are Permanently Removed by the use of KUTNOW’S POWDER.
TTNQTJESTIONABLY the necessity of vigorous health is seriously personal to everyone, and therein lies the value of
Kutnow’s Powder, which is superior to any known remedy of the age. It’s purity, its painless action, its prompt
alleviation of suffering, and its strengthening, refreshing, invigorating virtues entitle it to the splendid tribute to its
merit which was paid when
The Court Physicians prescribed Kutnow's Powder for Members of the Royal Family.
On taking Kutnow’s Powder in the morning, an improvement in energy is instantly felt, and a joyous feeling of
vigorous health pervades the whole system. Business difficulties disappear under shrewd solution; in fact, like all compli-
cated and delicate machinery, the cleansing operation at once produces the perfect contributory working of all the functions
which go to make a perfect man, who thus becomes himself again, eats well, sleeps well, and works well.
General Approval
“Care of National Bank (Ltd,),
Boshof, Orange River Colony,
South Africa, 19th July, 1902.
“Dear Sirs, —Although I have only used
your Kutnow’s Powder for a week, I find it
has a most beneficial effect, and shall gladly
recommend it to anyone suffering. Knowing
now that it can be obtained at Lennon’s I
shall not be without a bottle. The more
your Pow’der is used, the more benefit to
the public.
“Yours very truly,
“L. MORGAN.”
HOLD FAST TO THAT
WHICH IS GOOD.
CAUTION.—There are some unscrupulous dealers who for the sake of extra
profit try to sell imitations of Kutnow’s Powder. These may cost a few pence
less, but are worthless, and consequently dear at any price. Insist upon having
Kutnow’s, and do not allow yourself to be persuaded to accept any substitute.
There is only one
Genuine Kutnow’s Powder.

The Fugitives.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The fati man stole stealthily up the dark lane and
paused in the shadow of the fifth gate.
“This looks like it,” he muttered huskily to
himself, looking up at the back windows of the
house. Then he found a dust-box and started to
climb the gate, for it was locked.
“ Darn it! ” The fat man paused and felt for
the nail that had ripped his garments. After
groping for-a minute he discovered it, and tore his
finger badly trying to wrench it out.
“ Darn it! ’’ He whispered fiercely to himself
and sucked his wounded finger. “That nail
always tore everything!” After a while he
clambered down into the yard and slunk into the
shadow of the wood-shed, where he managed to
bruise his shins on an empty packing-case. Then
he cursed again and sat down on the packing-case
to think.
A door at the upper end of the yard opened
suddenly, and a man stepped out and walked,
whistling, down towards the gate.
Opposite the wood-shed he stopped and started
back.
“ Who’s there ? ” he snapped.
The man on the packing-case was as if stricken
dumb.
Then came the sudden flare of a match, in which
the man on the case was discovered, blinking like
an owl.
“ It’s only me! ”he sighed, wearily.
“ You!” The match hissed in a puddle, and
the two faced each other in the gloom.
“I thought—you were dead/”
The man in the shed sighed again. “No,” he
murmured, “ I ain’t dead.”
“ I thought you were drowned in that,wreck? ”
“Missed th’ boat,” said the mysterious one.
“Good God!’’gasped the other, and put his
hand against the'fence to steady himself.
Then the visitor, in an apologetic whine, began
to talk, and the other man listened —listened help-
essly to the end.
1 • * • *
“Well, now that you’ve come back, what are
you go.ihg to do l ”
The returned shuffled uneasily in the shadow.
“P unno >” l* e muttered feebly.
The other peevishly cursed him.
“ You dog, why’can’t you decide ? If you will
come back from the dead, why can’t you come
respectably: to the front door ? ”
Tliere was a faint murmur of reproach.'
“Shut up, you dam sea-ghost!” hissed the
host. “ I don’t believe your yarn about missing
the boat. I don’t believe you’re alive. You’re
dead, d’ye hear—dead as a door-nail! ”
“ Steady, Bill. Now ”
“ Bali! It’s a lie, I tell you—a lie !•”
“It ain’t!” protested the dead man. “It ain’t
a lie, an’ what’s more, I don’t want t’ come back
an’ bust th’ show. I didn’t ’ave no picnic with
’er when —when I was—.” He faltered and
Btopped.
. “ Alive ! ” suggested the other.
“Put it that way if yer like. Anyway, I don’b
want to come back.”
“Just as well for you.”
“I don’t want t’ come, Bill.”
. Bill gave a grunt of contempt.
“You can’t come back ; you’re dead ”
“Far as she’s concerned, Bill, I am, an’—’tween
ourselves—l ain’t sorry. Come here a minit.”
After a little whispered persuasion Bill went
and sat beside him, and his visitor laid on his
knee the heavy hand of confidence and poured
forth his sorrowful soul.
“When I left ’er, Bill—seven years ago—l
didn’t do it because I was too well treated. I left
’er, Bill, because she’d been givin’ me a devil of a
time. D’ye believe me now, Bill ? ” He leant
forward and peered into the other man’s face, but
the other man was eloquently silent.
“ I was .drove to it, Bill—drove to it. So when
me chance came I gave it best an’ cleared out t’
make another start. I did it as much for ’er
sake as for me own, for th’ energy she was puttin’
inter naggin’ at me was wearin’ ’er out, body and
soul, an’ I could see it. Ain’t that right, Bill ? ”
Bill shifted uneasily on his seat, and kicked
softly at the wood-pile. “That’s right, Joe.
She told me often and often she couldn’t stand
the sight of you.”
Joe gratefully patted his friend’s knee. ‘ ‘ ’Course
she couldn’t, Bill I don’t blame ’er a bit neither.
Me dyin’, so t’ speak, was th’ best thing that
could ’ave ’appened, an’ now that I’ve found out
’ow good ye’ve been, an’ ’ow ye’ve stood by ’er,
an’ ’ow ’appy y’ are, I thought I’d just borry five
bob or ’arf a quid orf ye, ’an we’d say no more
about it.”;
Bill sat up, with a jerk. “ What did you say ? ”
“ I said, Bill ” —Joe’s voice was tremulous with
emotion—“ now, that I find yer so ’appy, I
thought as ’ow ’arf a quid—— ”
“ Who the blazes told you I was happy ? ”
“W’y” (in a tone of pained astonishment).
“Ain’t yer ? ”
“ You fool! Why, if I thought I’d have to
stay with her much longer, I’d cut my throat.
Now ”
‘ ‘ Don’t—don’t she treat yer well, Bill ? ”
“ Treat me ! ” Bill leant over and thumped
impressively on his shirt-front. “ She leads me a
dog’s life. Says I’m ten times worse than you
were, and wishes I was dead ! ”
“ That’s what she uster say to me, Bill. It’s a
sort o’ sayin’ o’ hers. Look ’ere, now—don’t you
mind what she says. She’s got a temper, but
she’s a good girl, Bill—a jolly good girl, an’ you
stick to ’er! ”
“Now, what the devil are you snivelling
about ?”
“Me, Bill!”
“Yes —you. What do you mean by crawling
round now and preaching about her to me. You
were glad enough to clear out ! ”
“Well, Bill, I—l ain’t denying it, I know I
did it! ”
“Very well, then. Now listen to me.” Bill
leant forward and whispered something through
his clenched teeth that made Joe clutch at his
arm and gasp as if in pain.
“ Bill, ole boy ! Oh, Billy—you wouldn’t leave
’er now—would yer ? ”
“ Shut up! After you were reported dead, I
married her, and what sort of a time have I had !
.... Look here! If you don’t take me with you
—you cur —if you don’t help me out, I’ll ”
“ Don’t, Bill! I’ll take yer ! ”
“ Unless I go with you to-night ”
Bill tightened his grip and pointed to the
shadow on the blind.
So they stood, for a space, while the original
husband thought it out.
At last he whispered: “I suppose, Bill, she’ll—
get ’long all right, eh ? ”
‘‘ I suppose so.”
“Seems a bit —just abit’ardon ’er, don’t ver
think ? ”
“ Harder on us ! ” hissed Joe, pulling his arm.
They tip-toed, gently to the gate. Even then
Bill turned and looked back as if his conscience
troubled him. Then, at a nudge from Joe, he
slowly turned, grabbed the top of the gate with
both hands and bent his right leg at the knee.
“Gimme leg up!” he sighed, and was hoisted
for ever out into the cold, unfeeling World.
KODAK.
Curious item from the Argus :
John Kendall has been missing from his home in
Drummond-street, Oarlton, since 23rd inst. He was a
probationer from the Sunbury Asylum, and suffered from
the delusion that he was going to obtain work in Mel-
bourne.
He suffered from the delusion that he was going
to obtain work in Melbourne ! Have the reduced
tariff and the Irvine-Bent Government brought
things so low as that ?
These “ society ” items are taken in dead
and solemn earnest from an English paper, de-
voted to the doings of the British aristocraoy:—
We were sorry to hear after going to press last week of
another death among Miss ’s pets, and now she writes
us : “ It is with great grief I am' writing to tell you my
dear, sweet Marquis Ito of Kobe has not been spared me.
He passed away this morning. He made his debut at
Marl’s Court, November, 1901, and since then he has taken
seven specials, nine seconds and twelve firsts. He is
sorely missed, as he was too sweet a companion and
friend. lam most wretched. This makes my ninth dog
taken from me. It is very hard.”
Mrs. passed through many trying moments last
night when her good brood bitch, Ping Sheng, was having
her litter by Prince Kwang. Three dead puppies were
removed, and she suffered greatly from exhaustion, but
happily she recovered, and is now getting on well with
her four red bitch puppies, which were afterwards born
alive.
“ Kati-Kati ” : Struck a philosopher the
other morning. Came to the door with a basket
of oranges to sell. It was raining. The lover of
knowledge seldom knows enough to come in out
of the wet. Bought some, and asked him why he
didn’t get a horse and cart. Said he used to have
one, but the horse dying, and there being no
sinking fund to replace it, he got a hand-cart and
wore it out; replaced it with a wheelbarrow, and
when that was finished bought his basket, which
was getting a bit shaky. Thought an old sugar-
bag would suit him when it was done. Seemed
very like our politicians.
YVestralia lias been shuddering at some
Zolaesque descriptions of the local prime steak
and undercut. A goldfields correspondent gave
one of his experiences:—
While passing a butcher’s yard the other day I stopped
to watch a bullook being killed. I saw them cut the
head off, and oh 1 what a mess with lumpy jaw. When
the liver and lights were being removed about a bucket-
ful of rotten matter came out, and the stench was some-
thing terrible. Prom what the slaughterman told me
they were condemned cattle, and were supposed to ba
destroyed for pleuro and tick, of which he said they were
full.
None of these places have public abattoirs; and
without public abattoirs meat inspection is mostly
a farce. Even when a very big firm (with a
Minister among its lawyers) was accused by the
Stock Department of dodging a tuberculous
mob past the inspector, the Government took the
inquiry out of the hands of the Perth S.M., to
whom it had been remitted. Certainly a Minis-
terial inquiry was promised; but, of course,
nothing came of that. After Australia has got
its importers into the way of being honest, it
might do a lot worse than give some serious
attention to its butchers and stock-dealers.

Phantasy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Darkness—f! irkness over all—
Midnight dim and deep —
Wearily the wild winds crawl
Over strath and steep.
Dreaming swings the world away,
Whirling to a cleaner day :
Shall I rail or shall I pray,
Since I cannot sleep ?
Lone—alone ! Across the gloom,
Watching in the night,
I can mark faint things of doom,
Dim shapes of affright,
Reeling in fantastic crowds,
Softly chanting drifting clouds,
Girded all around with shrouds,
Trailing faintly white.
Waking from a fever-spell,
In my room alone,
Strange eyes from the back of Hell
Freeze me cold as stone !
Flying voices, eyes a-stare,
Take grey wings and cleave the air—
Here, before me, everywhere,
Crying in soft moan.
Lone—alone ! The vampires jeer
At my poor estate.
Fiends, who stole, her hut last year
When the Spring was late,
Grant her now a brief release,
That her face may bring me peace,
Respite, and a sweet surcease
From a world of hate!
And—a voice is in my ear,
Gentle, soft, and low !
Trembling in a breathless fear,
Like the underflow
Of a sightless spring that cries
From its darkness for the skies ;
So, she stoops with radiant eyes,
Stoops unto my woe 1
Fade the grey wings: Darkness slips,
Rolling out of space ;
All things vanish but her lips
And her saintly face.
Low beside me close, she kneels,
Round my neck a soft arm steals,
And my reason rocks and reels
In its hiding-place.
Swift she rolls the veil of years
Backward to a June,
Smiling through its nightly tears,
Full of mellow moon.
June, when side by side we crept
Down the moony meads that wept,
Hearts and hands that swung and leapt
To an elder tune.
Frail our little world of love,
Dark the things to be,
Stillness in the willow-grove,
Moaning on the sea.
When they robed her as she lay,
Blinded to a singing day,
And the old hearts crept away
Quaking mournfully.
But to-night she lays her head,
Shining, on my breast,
And ecstatic things are said,
Lips to lips hard pressed;
Arms entwining crush and cling,
Strange birds in a nowhere sing
Paeans of eternal Spring,
In a golden West!
From my heart the shadows roll,
And this soul of mine
Goes out forth to meet her soul,
Radiant, divine.
In sweet sanctuary they meet,
Locking in communion sweet;
She is kneeling at my feet—
How her dark eyes shine !

A Morning Caller.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One day in Nor’-West Australia I had a
long, hard day’s ride, with a good deal of foot-
climbing over and up and down broken gullies.
Coming to a comfortable-looking point on a sandy
creek with a bit of fresh feed, I determined to
camp.
The sun was nearly down ; I hobbled out
quickly, lit the fire, and put down my quart pot
to boil whilst I made my bed. The day had been
very hot, so I had a refreshing bath, finished my
meal, and turned in. I am a good sleeper, going
comfortably off as soon as I lie down, hardly ever
waking until near daylight. This night I
slept as usual, waking a trifle earlier to find a full
moon lighting up the surroundings. I lay for a
few moments, planning my day’s work, when to
my horror I saw a large and hostile-looking
crocodile steal noiselessly out of the water at my
very feet.
For a moment I was spellbound ; then, realising
the situation, without once removing my gaze I
grasped and brought my rifle to bear upon him,
but he was in such a direct line that there was no
vulnerable spot for a safe shot and the bullet
might glance off. Should he prove to be a man-
eater he might fight for it then. I could fire if he
moved closer.
I was still as a statue and the saurian was as mo-
tionless as the rocks around us. I could see down
the partly opened jaws that seemed tongueless in
their blackness. He was within a few yards of
me when, like a flash, lie rushed upon the dog,
then just stretching himself from his sleep at my
side. The dog, however, saw him in time to
nimbly leap aside. T en round and round they
went, the huge brute being quite as agile as the
dog, whilst ever and anon the vast cavernous jaws
smote together with a slam like the falling of a
dozen suits of armor. The vicious sweeps of the
great muscular tail were so sudden, and swept so
close to the dog, that I felt he must be taken.
Yet I could not help until I could get a fair open-
ing. Kneeling on my bedding, with finger on
trigger, I keenly watched for a chance.
It was clear the crocodile trusted more to the
quick, wide sweeps of his tail than to catching
with his jaws, though the great teeth gleamed
savagely, and the narrow evil eye seemed to fairly
blaze with venom. They were now. about a dozen
yards from my bed, and though minutes seemed
to have passed I dare say it was really only
seconds. At last the dog was cast half-way to
the bed by a spent blow of the tail, and the
monster was on him in an instant, but the rifle-
bullet was first, and over the enemy rolled from a
lucky shot behind the ear.
I ate a bit of the foe that had intended eating
me. Very little sufficed. The dog wouldn’t touch
it raw, but filled up well off the grilled steaks.
The flesh was as delicate-looking as that of a
young pullet.
It was a narrow shave, but the odds are it was
the dog he wanted and not me. I measured the
prize by my whip, and found him between 14 and
15 feet long. The head was particularly big for
his size, and I fancy he must have been pretty
• old, for most of the teeth were very rounded and
worn at the points. I have two of them still—
one made into a matchbox. The brute’s head was
broader and thicker than that of any other croco-
dile I have ever seen, and the teeth had a pro-
nounced backward slope.
HARRY STOCKDALE.
Explorations in Civilization.
(BEING THE LETTERS OF AN AUSTRALIAN IN
EXILE.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
January, 16th.— I did not speak in my haste—
these people, and, I suppose, all the other peoples
of the old world, live on tradition, and all the lies
and ornaments which make up tradition—Gaud
Mayor’s Shows, and other squalid circus parades;
presentations of the “freedom of the city” to
some ancient Pistol who should be rewarded with
an axe, and only with an axe; cheap skite about
the flag that has braved a thousand years, and so on.
The worship of unnecessary ceremonial pervades
the national character. The papers gravely
chronicle as a fact of public interest that
“Lord Chelmsford is to be Gold Stick-in-
Waiting, and Colonel Colley Silver Stick during
March.” In municipal life the beadle still orders
ratepayers to appear before the alderman of the
ward at a wardmote, and the Gaud Mayor and
the aldermen go in a carriage of appropriate brass
to open the session of the Old Bailey—as if we
were still in those days when a Judge was a bitter
prosecutor and went in state to open his court
with his hangman going before him.
You know that the idiocy of “ beating the
bounds” is still practised in some Australian
towns, but the most they do is to drive the Mayor
and councillors round the boundaries and to give
them, on their return to the town hall, more or
less drink. The silly performance dates from a
time when surveying was cutting its first tooth,
and every man’s land had an alignment according
to the man’s individual taste and fancy; and at
that time the necessity for the grown generation
teaching the youths the boundaries of their towns
and villages was probably great; although one
cannot help being amazed at the marvellous kind
of intellect which could skite about its greatness as
a nation and yet was unable to chart a village.
But to this day the silly practice is perpetuated
in London. On a day in January or February the
beadles convoy a number of boys to the town
boundaries. The boys carry wands, but at certain
points on the city boundaries the boys only bear
the wands—that is to say, they bear the half-
dozen blows inflicted on their pants by the beadles
at each halting-place. The idea of beating the
boys at the bounds—or “beating the bounds”—is
the same brilliant idea which flogs boys in public
schools who fail at the fifth proposition of Euclid.
After the beating of the bounds each boy receives
an orange and sixpence ; and each beadle gets a
roast of beef. This is not a description of a cus-
tom of the Chinese before the opium war—it is
written of London in 1901.
The King is not allowed to pass the Memorial
of Temple Bar that blocks the Strand, without
the Gaud Mayor presenting the city keys—
although everybody knows that there are no
gates—and then riding before Edward to the
Guildhall. Ask the reason for the continuance
of this, and you are told that you are a low fellow
who wishes to “destroy the picturesque.” The
picturesque ! The memory of the Gaud Mayor
trying to mount his horse, after presenting a
ridiculous key that doesn’t fit any known lock, to
a stout monarch in a brass hearse, is one of the
funniest memories I have.
In 1585, Queen Elizabeth granted to the people
of Corby—a village in Northamptonshire—an
exemption from all town and bridge tolls in
England. The privileges have, of course, long
since disappeared, but the people of Corby hold
the Toll Fair regularly to celebrate the dead Act
of 1585. After the rector and the chairman of
the parish have read the charter and opened the
fair they are put in the stocks. Other digni-
taries are strapped to a pole and carried through
the village.
Queen Anne was crowned in 1702 and in 1902
the bi-centenary was celebrated at Kingston-on-
Thames, and—touching fact !—a newly gilded
statue of the late Queen Anne was unveiled by a
Jap., one Hayashi, who is also a Viscount, but
who is primarily a Jap.
On Whitsunday, 1000 years ago, that is in the
year 902, Edward the Elder was crowned at’
Kingston. There is evidently somebody still alive
who remembers this Saxon king, who gnawed his
meat direct from the bone and died without ever
seeing a clean floor or using a fork at meals, for
in 1902, a thousand years after, Edward the Elder’s
coronation was celebrated at Kingston.
There was never before such a collection of
dressed-up and tricked-out children as the Judges
and the parties and the witnesses of the Court of
Claims—constituted for the Coronation to fix
certain procedure and positions. There was the
Lord Chancellor as President, in black and gold
robes, the Duke of Norfolk in the mediaeval finery
of an Earl Marshal with the ribbon and Star of
the Garter. One Frank Dymoke claimed to be
the King’s Champion by right of ownership of the
Manor of Scrivelsby. The duty of this burlesque
officer is to go before the King in the Coronation
procession and invite people to tread on the tail of
his coat at least all such people as consider the
Kingnottobeafitand properperson. Nomantook
up the challenge at the last Coronation, but one of
these days Mr. Dymoke will challenge once too
often. The humor of taking up the challenge has
evidently not occurred to anybody—when it does,
the joker may be rewarded with three months’
imprisonment.
The Duke of Newcastle and the Earl of Shrews-
bury claimed “the right to provide a glove for the
King’s right hand, and to support his Majesty’s
right arm while he is holding the sceptre.” The
Duke of Newcastle won his claim for the reason
that he is “ Lord of the Lay Manor of Worsop ”
—whatever that may ,be. The Earl of Shrews-
bury was comforted by being granted the right to
“carry a white staff.” I don’t like to see an earl
in tears, and I hereby give him the right to carry
a telegraph pole, if he wants to.
The Lord Mayor claimed the right to “serve
our Lord and King in the Abbey by carrying
before our said Lord and King the crystal sceptre
or mace of the said city.” For an hour this
Solemn Circus argued the important matter.
Finally a book of 1629 proved that in 1629 the
Mayor went to a Coronation in a red robe, and so
the Mayor was granted what he had asked for;
and departed as pleased as any other savage who
has inherited four beads and a foot of hoop-iron.
There were fierce fights for the right to carry
a sword, a pair of spurs and a second sword ; and
finally the Earl of Errol said he had a right “ to
walk as Lord High Constable and to have a
silver baton tipped with gold at each end.”
When thi3 was granted he asked for =B9 10s.
to pay for a new baton; and the Solemn Circus
agreed, with the grave elation of a man who had
just discovered a continent. After four days
of this portentous rot—this anxious competition
for a thing as valueless as a last year’s grass-
hopper—the court dissolved itself with the en-
thusiasm of flat ginger-beer.
England is not alone in this matter of glori-
fying the penny-bun and gilding the trivial. All
Europe has the complaint badly. But some other
parts of Europe seem to know they have it, while
England doesn’t.

A man’s right to marry his deceased wife’s
sister Jane is good enough for a country where
man is politically supreme; but, when woman gets
as high up the ladder as the man, she wants just
the same right to marry her departed’s brother
Ebenezer if she feels that way and the brother
thinks he can stand it. The first Bill introduced
by the first Attorney-General that Maoriland has
had for something like 10 years is intended to
give her that right in certain circumstances.

“ At even it shall be light, ”
.Thus said the Christ to men.
Nay,” said Lord Buddha, “ when
Draws nigh the cosmic Night,
When the sun of Time is cooling, westing,
The wearied son], like a bird, would be nesting ;
The eventide is the time for resting;
Peace, not Knowledge, and Rest, not Light,
Shall be yours in that solemn Night.”
Too much of light has man
In this world of stress and strain ;
Dazed eyes and reeling brain
Are his through all Life’s span.
Restless and eager, in wasteful measure,
He hunts a shadow and calls it pleasure,
He heaps up dirt and he deems it treasure
O, to be free from this foolish strife-^
This mad unrest called Life 1
Is Life, then, in living worth ?
Yes ; with this truth impressed—
That we but attain to rest
Through countless birth on birth.
Through strife of unit, family, nation,
In cycle, century, generation,
We shall reach at last Life’s consummation,
And in Nature’s soft embrace remain,
Nor ever be born again.
’Twas Goethe’s earthy soul
That called for “Light, more light,”
When he felt the shades of Night
Over his being roll.
Spirits pure, by no earth-fear haunted, .
Welcome the Night, serene, undaunted ;
No tears are shed and no dirges chaunted ~
When these, with heaven-erected head,
Through the god-like twilight tread.
The Day hath many eyes;
The Night, with sweet control,
Blots from the placid soul
Fear, Wonder and Surmise.
Full many splendors the Day concealeth ;
Millions of glories the Night revealeth ;
At Nature’s the spirit kneeleth.
Then hardly to feel, and not to know,
Is sure surcease of woe.
We shall not be glad or afraid
In the Night whither all must go ;
There shall neither be high nor low,
Neither Maker nor made ;
No man, no woman, no tribe, no nation,
No heavenly crown, no Hell’s damnation ;
Only the Oneness of Creation;
God and the Devil, beast, rock, and tree,
Shall all be One as we.
Then shall we taste true bliss—
Neither to think nor to speak,
Neither to know nor to seek;
Conscious only of this—
That all which Time once marred is mended,
That Nature and we in one are blended,
That Hate is conquered and Strife is ended,
That nevermore is there worst or best—
Only most perfect Rest.

Bung in the Bush.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bung’s is a sorry calling when sifted right through,
and Bung’s people, generally, are vicious and poor
and mean. Bung has got the bush as well as the
cities of Australia. This is one of our curses.
The really independent publicans of the bush
might be counted on one man’s fingers in any
State. All the others are tied, bound to iniquity,
compelled to rob, cheat and betray; tempted to
do a good deal more if they want to get a “ nest-
egg.” They have no wholesome traditions behind,
no honest prospects ahead. The very earliest
dealers in rum were among the very “nicest”
people in the land —Johnstones, Macarthurs,
Wentworths, Blaxlands—all of them panned off
gold from the lees of the rum casks, but in a
wholesale sort of way. They were the Bungs of
their time, and doubtless had their retail distri-
butors who were not too scrupulous.
Our earliest shanties were dens where men met
secretly to shake off the horrors of a life that was
hell on earth. The earliest shanty-keepers were,
without exception, copvicts ; generally “bad-
uns,” and they ha've established the traditions and
shaped the laws of the trade. There never was a
Boniface amongst them : there never was an inn
worthy of the name. On some main coaching-
lines good hotels grew (and generally decayed) but
they were never for bushmen, never for the people
of the land, never for the man with a shilling or
two in his pocket, who wanted food and comfort,
with no more fire-water than would quicken his
appetite or soothe him to rest. A man of that
sort is of no use to the bush-publican, to Bung’s
man. And what use would the bush market-town
publican have for the farmer who would drive in
with his own horsefeed and his pound of steak, or
chops; who would say to the hostler, “Stable and
feed ’im, lad and to the. missus, “Ha’ they
frizzled for me in half-an-hour, and taties wi’
em ! ” Table tp lay and knives to clean, cooking,
waiting, attendance, with a pint of honest malt
liquor—all for aK.shilling! Beelzebub, Muggins
and Murdoch are not in business for that sort of
thing. They are Bung’s men. With them a man
sliould. breast the bar when he comes in, and take
his food as it is put before him.
Suppose a traveller comes along at 3 or 4, keen
to eat,./willing to drink, ready to pay, what is his
welcoriie ? I will quote two instances in strange
contrast. One was a big hotel back of Western
Port in Victoria, and four of us, not all undistin-
guished, arrived at 3 ; sharp-set, eager. “ Some-
thing to eat, something to eat.” “Well, it’s an
awkward time of the day.” “Awkward be
hanged. Is there anything awkward about some
cam and eggs > or a spatchcock, or a red-hot steak
or chop with omelette or pancake to follow ? ” It
was all very well to talk ; the best that could
be done by Bung’s man was a neither-hot-nor-cold
with sour bread and pickles. That was “A
Motel, written big.
Ihe other instance was in the old world and
near the city of Oxford. Three of us, lads, and
one senior, got in trouble over a “lasher’’—beat,
smashed, and some of us half-drowned. We had
to tramp four miles through wet meadows to a
visage, where we found an inn—Yew Tree Inn.
lne house looked as old as the yew tree. In 20
minutes we were in bed, with a steaming rummer
or grog. In lialf-an-hour tjiere was a dish of
bacon and eggs, with toast, butter, coffee and
cream. inree hours later our clothes were dried,
and merrily we footed it into town, mulct of but
Is 3d. each, for all that meat, drink, and com-
r?us.*' <^e > me die in a proper inn ;
but, while I live, heaven keep me out of all
Australian hotels, save a few in the city and a
tew more in the larger inland towns.
6 shall never get good bush accommodation
till real inns are established and Bung is hobbled
short; till no man is allowed to obtain a license
who cannot show that he has reasonable expecta-
tions of obtaining a livelihood, and that he is abso-
lute owner or State-lessee of the land whereon
the house is built. . Such a man should get an inn
license for a nominal fee. Scores now running
hotels could not, by legitimate business, make
enough to pay for their licenses. Then how do
they live ? In this way.
•i a pub down one of the rivers, 50
miles from a township and 30 miles from one of
tbe mggest stations in Australia. There was not
A5O worth of fair trade on the track in the year,
and yet M JSeil flourished. Shearing was coming
on, and men passing down in dozens every day.
Some were foolish enough to give M‘Neil a try.
All cursed him, and prayed they might be stiffened
if he saw more than the dust of their heels when
shearing was over. Then when 150 rouseabouts
and washers (it was hot-water-washing in those
days) came along with their cheques, or the
balances the hawks had left them, M‘Neil was at
the door with a white shirt and a new face. He
~ a blackfellow inside with a concertina, and a
gai from town * behind the bar. He got more
than 50 of them, and those who had protested
loudest were first down.
“What is a man to do?” asked M‘JS T eil after-
wards, and he produced Bung’s letter. Bung was
content to let things remain till after shearing,
but if by the end of November £lOO was not forth-
coming, certain steps would be taken. M‘Neil
was not disposed to wield a pick in a cutting or a
tank again, and so took steps to meet Bung’s
demands, just as three-fourths of the lessees of
those big, new hotels in town and suburbs do.
they can no more live on legitimate trade than
can the out-back publican. And so three out of
tour of the big beer palaces of stone, stucco, and
brick, should properly be called something else
than hotels. And does Bung know it ? Bung
playing the ostentatious game in public charities-
relieving one where he has debauched and ruined
a, hundred—Bung has got to sell his beer: and,
because assignations and prostitution, drugging’
robbing and debauchery help him, they arf his
accepted allies in town and bush.
But Bung must not have all the blame of the
bush horror. The squatter who runs his business
on strictly commercial lines (generally because,
mortgaged up to the hilt, he has no alternative)
has nearly as much blame as Bung. It never
occurs to him that man cannot live on “ten ten
two and a quarter” alone; that an occasional
spree is as necessary to his existence as is a holi-
day to the well-being of any hard-working citizen.'
Bverv other country under the sun has recognised
tins. Jews, Pagans, Turks, Infidels, as well as
Christians—all, save Australians, provide festivals
for their workers at all great harvests. Look at
the fine homely spree provided by the Thames
yeoman, when he has gathered in his hundred
acres of hay. Not much more than bacon, cheese
and beer, maybe, with cake and pasties for the
children ; but still a hearty and heartening feast
which sends the worker on his way rejoicing, and
leaves the master in no way impoverished. Com-
pare it, then, with the paying-off on a big
Australian station, where £40,000 worth of wool
has been shorn and a hundred men are going on
the road. It is stiff, formal and heartless as the
regular pay-day at colliery or factory. The man
who wants a change—a little bit of the light o’
things—must just “go up to M‘Neil’s.” And
there Bung s satellite-Satan’s Ganymede—melts
him down.
It is the same with the harvest. No joy for the
workers. What’s called a harvest festival is some
mane and inconsequential church-parade in town.
Ay ! and the same even with the vintage The
grapes are plucked in devilish and deadly fashion
—never a song or a dance, or such a loving cup
as would leave folk quiet, warm, filled with plea-
sant memories and hopes for the future. Bung is
the only purveyor of anything that takes the
worker mentally or physically off the treadmill of
the bush ; but he who goes to Bung goes to the
-Devil also. Pity it should be so; but who’s to
mend it ? The strict commercial idea, becoming
day by day more dominant in all things, offers no
hope. There is not the smell of a “ spree ” in it,
and without an occasional wholesome spree no
man may live and be a man.
There is a doctor in this city, very well to do,
mature and wise now, who tells a tale of grim old
student days in Glasgow. “We were a poor set, ”
he says ; “none too well clad or fed, and desperate
hard-workers; but once a week we had a sympo-
sium. Everyone managed to bring along some-
thing, if it was only an inch of hard liquor in the
butt of the bottle. And so, for one night of the
week, we drank, talked, sang and gloried to-
gether.”
“A pitiful .waste of money, time and health,
surely,” said the commercial man. And the
doctor answered, “By Heaven, sir, I believe it
was the only thing kept us alive and sane.”
For lack of something of the sort—something
twice a year, even, might suffice, if sure—a good
many of our bushmen become insane or die, and
Bung doesn’t even bury them.
F.M.
One of those Victorians who are leaking
haste to get away from the land of Bent and
Shiels thoughtfully wrote to Melb. Herald
before he left, explaining that he did so because he
was a dairyman and couldn’t get land at a reason-
able price—a price that would allow him a decent
living for his labor. “ Country lands,” he wrote,
are practically a monopoly, the price being so
high that the man who buys sells himself into
slavery pretty well for his natural life. ... If
agricultural lands were about half the present
rates, we would not only stop the rush from here
but would attract desirable settlers from other
Earts of the world.” So, instead of staying and
el ping the Labor party to fight for a progressive
land tax that will force big estates into the market
in small lots, he and his kind run to the green
distant fields of S’Africa. The average farmer-
person, such as this emigrant, wants land, yet he
almost goes into hysterics if you talk to him of. a
graduated land tax that will force big locked-up
properties into the market.
Biliousness
FOR many years I have been a martyr
to Biliousness,” says Mrs. M. Jordon,
of Kelly-street, Scone, (N. S.'W.). “ Al-
most every fortnight I would have an
attack, and try what I would, I could get no
relief. The pain in my head was unbearable,
also the pain across the eyes. After eating I
would vomit terribly. I tried several so-called
remedies, but gained no relief. I then decided to
give Bile Beans a trial, although I had little faith
in them after my experiences with other medi-
cines. To my surprise I gained relief from the
first dose. Thus encouraged, I continued with
the Beans, following the directions closely, and
can now truthfully say I am enjoying splendid
health, and have never had a bilious attack since
I first began using Bile Beans. My work is now
a pleasure, and my friends have noticed the great
improvement there is in me. Words cannot
express my gratitude to you for your wonderful
n
M
medicine, and I hope that many others suffering from Biliousness will be persuaded
to try Bile Beans.
BILE BEANS have now a world-wide reputation for curing BILIOUSNESS,
HEADACHE, INDIGESTION, CONSTIPATION, PILES, DEBILITY, FEMALE
WEAKNESSES, NERVOUSNESS, BAD BLOOD, PIMPLES, AND ALL SKIN
ERUPTIONS, BAD BREATH, ANAEMIA, LOSS OF APPETITE, RHEUMATISM,
and by giving tone to the system will ward off COUGHS, COLDS, and INFLUENZA.
Bile Beans are obtainable from all medicine vendors. PRICE Is. ljd. or 2i. 9d.

“T.D.”: Those two Italians mentioned by Melbourne
Harbinger of Light as having- been the mediums
whereby spirits conveyed operatic music from the outer
world are really repeating something alleged to have
happened right here in Australia. When Clifford Halle
(son of Charles) was here some seven or eight years ago
telling people how to sing', but giving very moderate
illustrations of the art himself, he engaged David Cope,
junior, as accompanist. One. night that musician made
the astonishing announcement that he had a composition
to play which had been communicated to him whilst in a
somnolent state by the spirit of Mendelssohn. The
music was passable enough, in its way, but scarcely up to
the Mendelssohn mark ; evidently the mighty Hebrew
had deteriorated.
Talking of a recent revival of “ Caste” a London critic
says:—“ Miss Carlotta Addison moderates the asperities
of the haughty Marquise, whose supercilious sneers at
‘ trade’ are strangely out of date in an age when half the
fashionable bonnet-shops and tea-shops are run by mem-
bers of the aristocracy,” “ Caste ” was produced by the
Bancrofts in 1867, and perhaps author Tom Robertson’s
notions of class distinction were a little old-fashioned
even then, but they passed criticism. The Marquise in
question—if writer remembers rightly—snorts at the
social pretensions of Captain Hawtre.v, a mere moneyed
person—“ Captain Hawtrey ! His father was in trade —
something in the city—Soap I believe.” The status of
soap-makers has risen considerably since 1867. So has
the status of Soap.
Durward Lely—Lely is an anagram of his patronymic,
Lyle—a Scotchman, who studied singing,in Italy, and
speaks Italian perfectly, and who gave Scotch monologue
entertainments some few years ago throughout Australia,
displaying one of the finest' tenor voices yet heard in
these States, has tieen “syndicated ” under the style of
Lely’s, Limited. Nothing is sacred to the company-
promoter. He may some day swoop down on our Sydney
Domain orators. Fancy-“ George Perry, Limited!”
Also he may float the holy places of Jerusalem, and call
them, “ Christianity, Limited.”
A London transpontine theatre, in the New Cut, had,
until recently, a notice posted to the effect that “ Ladies
without shoes or stockings are not to be admitted into
the dress circle.”
Marshall Hall’s Conservatorium girls can always be
distinguished on Melbpurne Block by the kind of clothes
they wear. They make a point of going about in heavy
colored gowns, severely plain in cut, wkh a surmounting
Panama (the older the better) practically devoid of
decoration. The more the student is able to afford stylish
dressing the less she looks like it, and the Melbourne
shop girl could give the “Con.” girl many yards and a
beating where dress is concerned. But when she makes
her frequently-repeated debut, the Marshall Hall product
emerges like a butterfly from her drab-condition. Every
Melbourne singing girl, by the way, makes her platform
debut at least three times.
“ P.” : For downright cheek the average “musical
competition ” judge takes the biscuit. At a well-known
series of contests the remarks of the adjudicating official
were so violent that many competitors, supposed to have
excellent chances, stood down rather than have the
functionary “ sling language ” at them in a crowded hall.
There are musicians who would make the Angel Gabriel
speak in exclamations and fireworks, but being a gentle-
man he would hide his head under his wing where no one
would hear him.
“Vul” lie that episode at Perth (W.A.), when three
shots came, at different times, through the window of a
hotel apartment occupied by Mr. Thorley, Of Williamson’s
Opera co. I reckon this is the beginning of a series of
tragedies. Australia exports an immense number of singers
to London, and they mostly fail. By-and-bye, there will
be a return-tide of insane Australian singers, who have
gone crazy with failure, and some of these individuals
will run amok. Naturally, they will begin to shoot at
the musical profession, as the one they are most interested
in. In the instance quoted above the Australian singer
who failed had evidently come back in a deranged state
by the cheap German boat, had got ashore at the'first
port in his haste to shoot somebody, and promptly com- .
menced operations by firing at the comic opera co.
Under these circumstances, all reasonable precaution
should be taken. If anybody with a wild expression and
a gun or a large axe—especially if there is blood on the
axe—calls at the theatre inquiring for Nellie Stewart he.
ought to be refused admission.
A picture now exhibiting in London contains 350 like-
nesses of actors and variety artists. The painter put his
wife in the foreground when he started the work three
years ago, and she remarked at the time that some of the
subjects would be dead before the picture was com-
pleted. She was the first to die.
Amusing to read in Melbourne Argus that “ Mr. Fritz
Mueller was'the guest of the University Conservatorium
students yesterday afternoon at the close of the second
term. He gave a very poetical reading of the so-and-so
sonata, &c., &c.” Mr. Fritz Mueller ! Four years ago he
was a “ child of tender years,” a “ small boy in knicker-
bockers,” and so forth. The Argus of June 19th, 1899,
reported his farewell benefit concert in this style : “ The
appearance of Fritz Mueller on the platform was the
signal for a hearty round of applause, and opera glasses
were eagerly focussed upon the youngest of the little
band of youthful musicians who have lately challenged
attention. . . . Master Fritz Mueller had on the printed
programme four pianoforte compositions placed before
his name, namely Gavotte in D major (Bach), &c., &e.
These were of course beyond the grasp of such a liliputian
performer, but the sturdy little fclloui attacked them in
no uncertain fashion, &c.” And now the sturdy little
fellow is Mr. Fritz. How rapidly these children age—
after they have had their farewell benefits in knicker-
bockers or short frocks 1

BY
'T^T - OWHERE is literary material more abundant
than in legendless Australia. Off the well-
-1. 1 beaten tracks of the spurious-pigturesque and
the unconditional-hoggish, lie spacious areas
of subject-matter, irreverently challenging the Biblical
axiom that “there is no new thing under the sun."
And countless types of character, evolved by the indus-
trial conditions of heretofore inarticulate life, confront
the eye and invite the graphic pen. For tragedy, pathos,
humour, fancy, however indissolubly linked with human
■
nature, mustassume
unhackneyed forms
in a continent which
resembles Europe
or N. America only
inasmuch as there
is a river in both.
Thefictional liter-
ature of Australia
—scanty at most,
and uneven at best
—has advanced by orderly gradation from Anglo-Austra-
lian, through Colonial, to National. The successional
replacement of the immigrant, with his old-world
ideals, by the impressionable representative of a new
type, has made such a transition inevitable. But the
mass of our literature is British; and book-begotten
sentiment dies hard, except among pioneers of opinion.
Conventionality persists in viewing Australian charac-
teristics and deviations as more or less exotic; whilst to
the fully-emancipated Australian these stand as self-
established units of comparison, as normal and legitimate
phenomena, in opposition to the hearsay conditions of
moister and less homelike lands.
The corresponding penalty of this National conscious-
ness is a certain narrowness of outlook, a spontaneous
impression that the sun rises over the Barrier Reef, and
sets behind the
Leu win. When
darkened by stolid-
ity, such focalised
regard is sometimes
amusing, sometimes
regrettable, though
always pardonable
except when it de-
generates into pro-
vincialism.

the Riverina.
But when illuminated by intelligence, the same insular
survey crystallises into far-sighted patriotism. When
further reinforced by acute observation and culti-
vated forecast, it invests with interest the minutest
details of National life. Add humour, sympathy,
and felicity of phrase, together with that rarest of
literary qualities, initiative, and the subtle touch of
nature is achieved. Then a new light of signi-
ficance is flashed on the commonplace ; a shade of
actuality softens the bizarre ; and each scene, action or
colloquy, carrying authenticity on its face, becomes an
indispensable accessory to the scheme. This describes
Tom Collins—at his best.
At his worst, he discloses an immoderate egotism,
apparently undisciplined by controversy, and evidently
fostered by solitary self-communion. Yet his introduc-
tion of Himself, if decided, is invariably courteous, and
often keenly interesting.
The book, Such is Life, which The Bulletin will publish
on the Ist August, is original in scheme. The author
premeditated pur-
pose of amplifying
the diary memor-
anda of one week,
and his book natur-
ally falls into seven
chapters. The first
date is taken at
hazard, from aseries
of filled-up pocket
•V V.
diaries.
This random text introduces five typical bullock -
drivers, with three or four assorted nomads. The day is
uneventful, but the night’s camp (a risky grass-steal) is
enlivened by Out-back topics. The scene is on the
Lachlan plains.
Then, for sufficient reasons, the diary-records cease to
be consecutive, and are henceforth separated by monthly
intervals. The scene of Chap. II is placed in the Lach-
lan-Darling scrub country, amongst station hands. Chap.
11l opens on the Murray, between Echuca and Albury.
Chap. IV displays the Lower Lachlan, with actors proper
to the scene \ and Chap. V falls in an adjacent locality,
with all accessories widely dissimilar. Chap. VI returns
to the vicinity of Chap. I, but the aspect is squattocratic,
not nomadic. Chap. VII is arbitrarily built on a date six
4s
■
or seven weeks sub-
sequent to that of
its forerunner, in
order to serve as a
sequel.
Underneath this
obvious dislocation
of anything resem-
bling narrative hfn
several undercut'-
rents of plot,
manifest to the reader, though ostensibly unnoticed bv
the author. For example, an incidental camp-fjre varii,
in Chap. I, casually- furnishes the key to some strong
character-painting in Chaps. IV and VI. In fact, the
studied inconsecutiveness of the “ Memoirs is made to
mask intricate coincidences and cross-purposes.
The book is handsomely bound in cloth, decorated ; the
price is 4s. 6d. Orders, accompanied by postal note, mar
be sent to The Bulletin office ; and the book will be for-
warded to any address.
