CHEPSTOW,A WELSH STRONGHOLD WITH A TURBULENT HISTORY
r pHE noble rhins of Chepstow Castle form one of the most
attractive features of the celebrated Wye Valley on the Welsh
borderland. Chepstow itself, as its former name “Chepe-Stowe”
implies, is an ancient market town,
Chepstow Castle, which is still in a fair state of preservation,
was originally built in the 11th century by William FitzOsbern,
and later served as a base for the powerful Norman lords in their
advance into Welsh territory. The main entrance to the castle,
shown in the above picture, is on the eastern side under a fine
Norman arch, flanked by two massive towers, and was guarded by
a portcullis. The greater part dates fronj the 14th century, when
the castle came into the possession of the Earls of Pembroke, the
last of whom was Richard Strongbow, who is known in connection
jvith the conquest of Ireland in 1172. Subsequently Chepstow
passed to Sir Charles Somerset, Earl of Worcester, from whom it
has descended to the present owner, the Duke of Beaufort.
The castle’s last warlike experiences were in the years between
1645-1648, when it was assaulted in turn by Royalists and Par-
liamentarians, gained and lost by each side time and time again.
After the Restoration, Henry Marten, a King’s Judge and one of
those who signed the death warrant of Charles I, was imprisoned
in v the'Drum-Tower of the castle for 20 years. He died in 1680,
and lies in the ancient Norman priory church in the town of
Chepstow. His epitaph:
Here or elswhere (all’s one to you or me),
Earth, air and water gripes ghostly dust,
None knows how soon to be by fire set free,
Reader, if you an old tried rule will trust,
You’ll gladly do and suffer what you must.

The Red Page
A "RED PAGE" BOOK.
It would have been a great pity if
Dougin Stewart had not collected some
of the best of his “Red Page” criticisms
in book form, as he has in The Flesh and
the Spirit (Angus and Robertson), For
it may reasonably be argued that what
Australia needs at this moment is not so
much the creative as the critical spirit.
The field of literature in particular is
all a-growing and a-blowing, but its
bright landscape is without perspective;
a tree or so and saplings, weeds and
flowers all mixed up together. We lack
self-knowledge and standards of value;
we follow overseas fashions without ex-
amining their roots and purposes; we
don’t, in fact, know where we are or
where we are going. It is true that much
of this applies to the literary world as a
whole, but it is Australia that matters
most to us. A soundly-based and
balanced criticism might make all the
difference in this matter, and Stewart is
among the very few who are capable of
supplying it.
Some of our reviewers are competent
enough, but more than mere reviews is
needed. Not that the reviewer may not
be a critic also, if his literary opinions
are based on principles derived from a
reading of the great books of the past
and the best books of today; Stewart
himself says something to this effect. But
even then it does not follow that the re-
viewer’s work will possess a real critical
value; he is often rushed for time and
pushed for space, and his objects and
the critic’s are not quite the same.
Of course the critic also has his faults ;
with him as well as with the reviewer,
rivalries, of schools or attitudes, if not
of persons, too often intrude. How many
critics, here or elsewhere, write without
paying, consciously or unconsciously,
some regard to more than the subject
before them? The Bulletin, like other
periodical publications, has naturally its
prejudices and preferences, but it has
ruled so long over the Australian liferary
field that it can comparatively easily
stand apart from local faction and
fashion. “Southerly” and “Meanjin,” in
spite of their solid development, are still
in the main training schools, so far as
criticism is concerned, even though an
occasional critical article in their pages
stands out, as good as anything of its
kind in’ this country.
Stewart is among the most discerning
and by far the most entertaining of con-
temporary critics. He is also one of the
very few whose opinions about overseas
books as well as our own are worth con-
sidering. However one may at times
disagree with him, he has to be read with
respect; though he has a most annoying
habit of coming out with something one
had intended to say oneself. He not
only possesses the necessary reading and
insight, but is balanced and bold and
sincere; he knows what he wants to say
and doesn’t give a damn how anyone
may react to it.
And he can express a serious and de-
liberate conviction in a careless, offhand
way, or, as in the Shean-Gallagher dia-
logues, in a burst of humorous extrava-
gance, both of which make it the more
telling. Only where in this collection is
Mr. Stewart’s (or is it Mr. Gallagher’s?)
delightful little beast of a nephew, Willie?
Perhaps the outstanding quality of
Stewart’s criticisms is their commonsense.
It is curious how he combines an appa-
rently easygoing and radical freedom of
expression with an underlying careful
precision and a’ general attitude of
moderation that almost approaches con-
servatism in fhe literary field. The Cult
of the Primitive, Freudianism, Finnegans
Wake, Hemingway and the he-man,
“modernism” in verse; these, in their
extreme forms, he vigorously opposes,
sometimes seriously and directly, but
more often and perhaps more effectively
by way of ridicule. Here, for example, is
what his Mr, Gallagher has to say about
the father of the principal character in
Odets’s Golden Boy:
It was time something to that effect was
said,
A similarly curious characteristic of
Stewart’s is his combination of the analy-
tical and the intuitive faculties. Not
only can he tell us what is good or bad,
but, and this is much more unusual and
more difficult, when and why it is so.
And it seems to me that his few failures
are on the intuitional side ; the dissection
of the corpse is always excellent, but just
occasionally, I think, he is mistaken as
to the corpse’s quality.
There is an air of freshness and com-
parative detachment about Stewart’s
approach to Australian literature to which
his New Zealand birth and upbringing
as well as his editorship of the “Red.
Page” have no doubt contributed.
Though he appreciates Furphy and re-
gards him as an Australian reader’s
natural food, he protests against Furphy’s
“intolerable discursiveness” and criticises
his “oversubtlety.” “A novel,” he re-
marks* in the person of Mr. Shean, “is
not a crossword puzzle.” He adds a
statement of which some enthusiasts may
not wholeheartedly approve: “Furphy is
a lance-corporal in the company of which
Cervantes is the captain.”
On the other hand he declares that
“Banjo” Paterson’s joyous gusto, fine
arrogance and triumphal recklessness are
“hallmarks of enduring art.” He even
suggests that Paterson ought to be in-
cluded in Tom Moore’s Six Australian
Poets; this seems even to an old admirer
of Paterson’s to be going rather far. It
is good to read his appreciation of Wil-
mot’s Melbourne Odes, though it seems
to me that he goes too far again in de-
claring Wilmot and Mary Gilmore to be
“of very nearly the same stature.” And
few, outside the devoted followers of
The Bulletin, would consider The Pea-
Pickers worth a letter to Shakspeare, or
that the passage quoted at the conclusion
of this letter was more than a piece of
slightly sentimental minor prose.
There is room for much greater dis-
agreement over Brennan. To go into
that would be out of place here, but it
may perhaps be said that Brennan’s
admirers have been long aware that the
metre of “The Wanderer” consists of an
irregular mixture of five- and six-beat
lines, to which the old-fashioned methods
of scansion do not apply. Stewart has
some balanced and acute comments on
overseas authors ; it is well worth while
reading, for example, his analysis of
Forster’s Passage to India.
The most marked characteristics of
Stewart’s own style are vigor, directness,
logic and clarity. Sometimes the points
that he makes so sharply have a quality
of epigram: “Trying to analyse William
Blake,” he says,“ is like trying to define
the sunset”... “It is certainly not the
writer of a Lady Chatterley’s Lover or a
Redheap who is the enemy of literature,
but the man who bans the b00k”... “The
Samson of ‘Samson Agonistes’ is an
image of hate ; but a hate so gigantic be-
comes a kind of black affirmation of life ;
affirming by its violent splendor the very
thing it seeks to destroy.”
It is not surprising in a man who is also
a poet and a dramatist that his criticism
should have poetic and dramatic qualities,
but there is not space here to go into that.
The contents of The Flesh and the Spirit
represent Stewart all round and not
merely at his best; but they make it quite
clear that the “Red Page” has had no
regular editor of his ability since the days
of A. G. Stephens.
H. M. GREEN.
“This revolting old man,” said Mr. Gal-
lagher, “this monster of a parent who tries
to keep his son at home playing the violin
when he is thirsting for life and adventure,
this ancient dimwit who cannot perceive that
the young man instinctively and rightly pre-
fers to be a good boxer rather than a
second-rate violinist; this elderly prude who
thinks that blondes and money—the delights
and rewards of combat—are a corruption;
this timorous old goat who has himself
retired beaten from the struggle of life and
tries to make a failure of his son before he
has even started to fight and who obstructs
him at every step of his career; this vulture
gloating over the slain body of his son —
he is, of course, the villain of the play?”
“The poor old vulture,” said Mr. Shean,
“is the hero.”
Cabell on Pirates.
When Somerset Maugham’s Catalina
was reviewed here it was described as
very much like a fantasy by James
Branch Cabell. Cabell’s There Were Two
Pirates (Bodley Head; Angus and
Robertson) is, to return the compli-
ment, very much like a fantasy by
Somerset Maugham.
It concerns a pirate named Gasparilla
and is set in Florida at the end of the
eighteenth century. Gasparilla, as is
proper for pirates, cuts throats and be-
haves improperly with female prisoners,
one of - whom, eventually slain by the
lover, is a princess. The deeds of violence
and naughtiness are told in precisely that
tone of detached, ironical amusement,
making them at once funny and rather
feeble, which Maugham employed in
Catalina and which probably originates,
though Maugham may have picked it up
from Cabell’s earlier fantasies, with De
Quincey.
By a significant coincidence Cabell,
like Maugham, has been unable to carry
his story straight through to book-
length, and has had to fall back on a
fantastic kind of mysticism to keep it
going. The book is divided into two
parts, and in the second half Ga&parilla,
aided by a magician, splits into two
personalities, himself and his shadow.
The shadow, offstage, continues to cut
throats and entertain the ladies around
the coast of Florida while Gasparilla
himself is transported to some mystical
dimension of space and time where he
revisits the scenes of his childhood and,
up to the point at which he became a
pirate, lives his life over again. At that
point he catches up to himself in
time, returns to mortal life and,
married to his first love, lives in
respectable retirement in Florida, observ-
ing from a distance the continued mis-
deeds of his piratical shadow.
This may, conceivably, be a profound
mysticism veiled in light humor. But it
reads, simply, like nonsense. .
Nonsense, made compelling and con-
vincing within its own limits, can be
funny. But this is not Convincing or com-
pelling. It reads like damned nonsense.
The first half of the book is amusing in
its light; ironical way; the second half,
like the second half of Catalina, merely
falls to pieces. The only real satisfaction
in reading it comes from a few of
Cabell’s cynicisms, as when Gasparilla,
always courteous, des'cribes his boyhood
sweetheart, now grimly middle-aged, as
positively “stupefying” in her beauty, or
when he comment? on marriage: “I do
not question, Don Diego, that marriage
is a holy institution, inasmuch as one
finds everywhere its martyrs.”
Cabell, poor fellow, has spent his life
trying to rewrite Jurgen and has never
quite succeeded. As he once said him-
self, he will go down to posterity as “the
author of an indecent book.” But that is
not altogether a lamentable fate, for to
have written one masterpiece that will live
in the company of Rabelais and the Droll
Stories is a rare and a great achieve-
ment. And at least Cabell did not write
it in Australia, where the law would prob-
ably have tried to send him to jail for
it, but in America, where a wiser and
more civilised Justice set it free to be-
come immortal.
Enter the Villain.
As one of a series of “weird stories”
the publishing firm of Home and van
Thai has revived J. $. Le Fanu’s A Strange
Adventure in the Life of Miss Laura
Mildmay. An enthusiastic preface by
Herbert van Thai declares:
Le Fanu is a peculiar example of the
neglected author, because he is a master
of just those qualities which have given to
Edgar Allen Poe an abiding fame. Those
who read the following story will find that
Le Fanu’s gifts were in all ways highly
individual and, in some ways, superior to
those of Poe.
Le Fanu, thus rescued from eternal
darkness, appears to have one quality
that could justly arouse his publisher’s
enthusiasm. He is a master of those
peculiar noises which, in the north of
England, pass for human speech;
“No, ma’am; but lawk! don’t ye see,
ma’am? Look at its eyen! Hoot! sic a
gloo it has!” —
and these, if laid on with a trowel, so
to speak, suggest that had he not been
obsessed by babies, virtuous heroines,
ghosts and villains —the conventional
props of Victorian melodrama —Le Fanu
might have written passable village
comedies.
But Le Fanu was so obsessed. At the
home of the vicar of Golden Friars there
arrives a baby which, it transpires, is
distantly related to the vicar and which
another wicked relative, in order to suc-
ceed to a legacy, had attempted to poison.
The wicked relative, whose name is
Captain Torquil, defied by the vicar’s
solicitor, “flings” from the room, “laugh-
ing and grinding his teeth” and proceeds
to invade the vicar’s home, hoping to
seize the infant.
Foiled by some heroic yokels in this
dastardly attempt, the captain retires to
the wars. After an interval of 20 years
there comes to Golden Friars a saintly
old person who writes letters to the Arch-
bishop of Canterbury and who, intro-
duced into the vicar’s home, takes the
baby—now Miss Laura Mildmay—on
long walks over the mountains looking
for wildflowers. Who can this saintly old
person be? Who else but Captain Tor-
quil ! We see him offguard for a
moment, unmasked by one of Miss Mild-
may’s stators in the bedroom of his
hotel:
Mr. Burton’s teeth were gone, and his
left eye was out, and a deep ugly hole was
in the place of that organ. He had screwed
his mouth into a grim grimace, and his
face looked ever so broad, and ever so
short. His whole face was crimson with
the fire of brandy, his lips were pursed and
working, as they will over toothless gums.
The blank eye puzzled the baronet, and
the other pierced him with a gleam of fire.
The baronet, though surprised at this
apparition, fails to warn Miss Mildmay,
who continues to pick wildflowers. Need-
less to say. Captain Torquil, alias Mr.
Burton, attempts td push her over a
cliff; needless to say again, she is
rescued; and marries the hero who
rescues her and lives happily ever after.
Messrs. Home and van Thai doubtless
meant well in reviving Sheridan le Fanu;
but it is doubtful if it was really kind
to bring him up to receive a bang on the
head that will settle him for all eternity.
The novelette, not in thd least “weird” in
van Thai’s sense of the term, unless an
excessively feeble ghost story told by an
aged retainer makes it so, is readable
only as a period-piece, a kind of parody
of itself.
A Feast of Locusts.
For a gong to announce The Feast of
the Locusts (Hutchinson) Christopher
Sidgwick smites the mess-tins he owned in
a small searchlight outfit on the coast of
Britain during the war, and he describes
Army life, particularly scrounging, with
pure accuracy and humor, which is no
mean feat.
Sidgwick classes his book as “a soldier’s
retrospect, in time of war, of a Europe
known in peace,” and until he begins his
retrospection it moves along at a fine
pace. But he chooses a tortuous trail to
take the reader exploring Europe
during the simmering period, twisting
back and forth through statistics, spinning
occasionally around the gay hurdygurdy
of the minority problems, and he has to
slow down to a walk. This is saddening
after the promise of the opening chapters,
and, besides, one feels that he is missing
a lot of interesting sights along the main
highway.
But he doesn’t miss them all. Before
the war Sidgwick went frequently to
Europe as a tourist manager in a company
tony enough to regard Cook’s parties with
grand patronage, though not so aloof as
to be immune from the danger of the
travelling English spinster and similar
occupational hazards. All spinsters Sidg-
wick treats in the light of one who im-
mortalised herself while going by bus
around some lake country and complain-
ing of car-sickness with a remark about
the dizziness which came upon her when-
ever passing water.
At Uzhorod, Sidgwick found a gipsy
school. Because of the inherent nomad
propensities of the pupils, discipline was
impossible, and whenever the master
broached some subject requiring any con-
centration 'they began leaving the room:
No period could endure for more than a
few minutes. The place was in a state of
perpetual uproar. It was a delightful
school.
Summed up, the book makes good light
entertainment. It is a feast of locusts,
small, making a pleasant buzzing, and,
for those who like such fare, easily
digestible.
Reviewed Briefly.
I Always Was Lucky: Cecil Field
(Macdonald). Ramblings of a journalist
who went round the world as a radio-
officer in the Merchant Navy. Since the
gentleman thinks Sydney Harbor is “over-
rated” he deserves, of course, scant con-
sideration, and it is a sad fact that most
of his information is superficial and
familiar: in Auckland, for example, he
learns that, some time previously, the
Maoris discovered New Zealand; and
that after the pakeha came there was a
Maori war. Still, he has a bright, chirpy
style and writes amusingly about life at
sea.
The Sports Book : Compiled by James
Rivers (Macdonald). General survey of
sport in Britain (including cricket) with
special (but belated) emphasis on Olym-
pic Games prospects. Illustrated.
Decentralization (Angus and Robert-
son) ; The papers read and the criticisms
and discussions at the 14th Summer
School of the Australian Institute of Poli-
tical Science at Armidale (N.S.W.) last
January. The book is a service to anyone
interested in the subject, as most
thoughtful Australians should be, and
opens up a big field for discussion.
The Practice of Painting: F. Schmid
(Faber). An unusual treatise in which
the history of drawing and painting in
the major European schools is traced
from early textbooks and by a study of
the palettes of famous masters. It is “a
glimpse into the workshop of a great
tradition,”

Were the interests of Cobb and Co.
confined to coaching?
No, as early as 1864 the co. bought
the well-known station Buckinguy, in
the western district (which was held
by Rutherford, one of the partners
who controlled the company, at his
death), and other properties in N. S.
Wales and Victoria. It also developed
the jarrah trade between Western Aus-
tralia and India, and was contractor
for the Glen Innes to Tenterfield
railway line, which involved the co. in
heavy loss. Rutherford gradually ac-
quired for himself extensive pastoral
properties in N. S. Wales and Queens-
land and imported prize stock on a
large scale; he also founded and
financed the Eastbank ironworks at
Lithgow, which were ultimately sold
to G. and C. Hoskins.

By whom was Malta held before
the English gained possession of the
island ?
Malta was held in turn by
Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians
and Romans, and was conquered by
Arabs in 870. From 1090 it was
joined to Sicily until 1530, when it
was handed over to the Knights of
St. John, who ruled until dispersed
by Napoleon in 1798. The Maltese
rose in rebellion against the French,
and the island was subsequently
blockaded by the British Fleet, aided
by the Maltese, from 1798 to 1800,

What are orchids and what makes
them so valuable?
There are many thousand varieties
of orchids, divided into two groups,
one growing non-parasitically on trees,
and the other on the earth. The
flowers, brilliantly colored, are often
highly scented, range through all sizes,
and have six perianth segments, three
sepals, two petals and a labellum.
In the centre is the column, a union
of stamens; style and stigma in one
organ. The most costly orchids grow
in tropical jungles, remote from civi-
lisation, and are obtained at risk to
human life; hence their high value.
But there are quite cheap ones —many
are growing wild in outer Sydney
suburbs.

Best age for a boy to begin boxing ?
The best time to begin is around
15 years of age, but it is inadvisable
to take part in contests before 20.
Some great boxers, particularly
Georges Carpentier, began boxing
early. Carpentier was only 14, a
flyweight, when he had his first ring
fight, but Carpentier was phenomenal,
and made good despite his early start.
A boy can begin boxing in amateur
contests at 16, but he should not
enter the professional field before
gaining maturity, between 20 and 21.

Lssen Judgment
By J.h.MELVILLE
MRS. SCOONES stared out through
the pickets with an amiable,
bovine stolidity. Her face, hung
with creases of doughy slackness,
was so shaded into dinginess by the brim
of a floppy white hat that it seemed, like
the pickets, to have weathered there under
drifting street-dust. Her weeding-bucket
was beside her. One gloved band as she
icnelt there was through the fence, but
she was merely fondling a thistle that
grew outside.
A busload of footballers, whose chorus
had roused her into lifting her head from
a catmint bush, passed on raucously, and
she again lowered her head into the mint.
The pungency of Saturday-afternoon
rubbish-fires was wafted over the town-
ship as in the drowsy sun Mrs. Scoones
courted solace. She breathed slowly and
deeply, her shoulders heaving.
SHE sought a boon, a secret she’d'first
learned behind a neighbor’s shed
when a child. There, down a city alley,
she had been beguiled by the scent of the
catmint, finding in it retreat from the
drabness of Rope Terrace, with its heap
of stinking oyster-shells black with flies,
and its eternally clanking grit-mill. Find-
ing in it, too, all the freedom and beauty
of an Ayrshire countryside as she’d heard
it dreamily recalled by the old Scots-
woman two doors down. Behind that
shed, a factory chimney soaring above
her, Mrs. Scoones had plapned a life of
happy illusion where the mint grew wild.
Now, a pair of green birds rocked
above her —atrocities of topiary work
shaped from a macrocarpa hedge—and
down one side of a low square house ran
a flarepath of salvia bonfire. Behind the
house windows, one of which was held
up precariously by a hammer, faded
blinds were drawn.
The clatter that came from the front
porch was Arnold Scoones bustling about
peevishly. Now and then he’d peep over
a leafy row of pot-plants —a cannon-ball
head with wrinkles running far back to
meet a receding hairline —to note her
response to the noise he was making.
His wife, however, showed no interest.
Under the canopy of her floppy hat, her
head was down in the mint.
ARNOLD SCOONES himself had
come as an answer to her mintbush
yearnings. He’d come as a plasterer’s
apprentice, clambering down the scaf-
folding of the Fruiterers Hotel. That
he’d spoken to her, tongue-tied and
awkward, while ignoring the cajolery of
Louella, her pert companion from the
wrapping-room, was something that had
puzzled her vaguely ever since.
Tossing his head about vigorously—a
habit soon mocked by the slighted
Louella —he’d confused and flattered her
with a flow of trade jargon. She’d been
able to grasp no more than that he was
emphatically disclaiming responsibility
for design and workmanship both of the
Fruiterers Hotel and a new block of
offices. She found herself agreeing to
inspect the offices with him the following
evening. From this beginning she was
to be hustled through a sort of industrial
courtship. Inspecting a hospital-exten-
sion job one night, he’d been gesturing
and butting his head at the air, when a
man who came bouncing out of the main
entrance patted her sympathetically and
murmured something about his own
trouble being in his ears; but Arnold
Scoones had not even paused in his tirade
against skimped reinforcing.
His range of knowledge amazed her.
She’d shivered in garages, awkward and
neglected, while he’d watched mechanics
at work, eagerly waiting a chance to offer
advice. Arnold Scoones, she’d told the
wrapping-room girls proudly, knew just
about everything about everything.
Then one night as they’d stumbled
amongst the litter of a contractor’s yard
he’d been moved, perhaps by some way-
ward protective urge, to suggest marriage.
With his knowledge behind her mint-
bush ambitions she hardly dared imagine
what lay ahead. His plasterer’s dungarees,
she had no doubt, would soon be tossed
aside. She was soon saying good-bye to
the wrapping-room girls. And Arnold
Scoones was piloted, scoffing, through the
ceremony of marriage. “Fiddlin’ bits of
nonsense,” he’d called it all.
But since those days her plans had gone
awry. She had to come home yet through
a rickety gate; the driveway curving
through silver birches was still a mintbush
dream. They were tenants now of the
fishmonger next door. Arnold Scoones
had criticised his way through such an
odd? variety of jobs that he was as likely
to be back in town one week as a lock-
smith’s assistant as he was to be out fol-
lowing a threshing-mill the next.
His infallibility disheartened her. She
missed the human dependence that would
have made her more a wife. He was so
invariably right, and the high authority
she’d once so" admired had, through the
years, become a curse.
»<N4E and the wife was just dis-
-IVI cussing this international financial
trouble,” was the sort of thing he was
likely to shout from the porch, where he
studied his paper. His stockinged feet
would be up amongst the pot-plants, and
whether she was close beside him or out
feeding her fowls he’d carry on a dis-
cussion in the same piercing monotone —
this for the benefit of people waiting out-
side the fish-shop for the bus.
Apart from the fact that a wholesome
ignorance of international finance
dropped her off at the next grocery bill,
Mrs. Scoones seldom ventured an opinion
on anything. When she did, he would
grimace painfully, groaning, “Look who’s
talking,” and she’d be relegated again to
the ranks of the dunderheads.
She’d long since suspected that Arnold
Scoones was a fraud. But she was just
a dull-witted woman, she’d tell herself
miserably, lacking the intelligence to call
his bluff. She’d tried, but each time the
outcome was as crushing as when they’d
seen the fishmonger’s twins struggling
home with a bathtub from the tip:
“Liquid manure,” Scoones had observed,
while she had boldly diverged by making
some mention of the bath shortage—a
comment that was to draw from the fish-
monger’s wife a blistering assurance that
the bathtub, full of liquid manure, could
be seen,at any tirpe by arrangement. She
should have known that Arnold Scoones
would be right.
The fishmonger’s wife was a shrewish
woman, and, perhaps because of twins
and a tippling husband, quick to take
offence. She made their tenancy seem an
uneasy charity. Her son-in-law was an
overseer on a railway-extension project,
and she never tired of repeating that
when the line went through and he re-
turned home the house would have to be
vacated. Arnold Scoones’s reply had been
to gather all available data on the pros-
pects and progress of the line, until even-
tually the fishmonger’s wife was consult-
ing him as an authority. Together they
would study the overseer’s letters home.
But Mrs, Scoones, lulled by the sweet
forgetfulness of the mint, was for the
moment untroubled by it all.
ABOVE the clatter from the shunting-
yard, she thought she heard the voice
of Mr. Twiss, a clear tenor voice raised
in greeting. Not hearing it again, how-
ever, she put it down to imagination.
She ’thought so often of Mr. Twiss now
that harvest-festival time had come round
at last, after a late season. His vegetable-
marrow was ready. A beauty, and the last
of the crop. She looked forward happily
to placing it in his arms. He’d thank her
earnestly, charming her with his naively
boyish manner, and his face would be
shining.
She always spoke of it as Mr. Twiss’s
marrow, making of it a personal tribute.
Mr. Twiss, as he passed in his car, would
smile such a greeting as to uplift her for
the rest of the day, and he never failed
to make her feel the most important
customer in his drapery store, even
though she might be buying only a reel of
cotton. For this, she offered her marrow
in acknowledgment. And seeing him in
the choir, so clean and shining, and know-
ing that even as he sang he had in his
mind her own special fitting in shoes
humbled her so much less because she
was growing his harvest-festival marrow.
How absurd to try to imagine Mr.
Twiss making such an arrogant demand
as Arnold Scoones had just done.
“Premise me you’ll never lay hands
on a carpenter’s tool again as long as
you live,” he’d insisted.
She’d refused. Such a fuss because
she’d used a chisel to drive screws. Mr.
Twiss would have explained tactfully
about chisels and put up the towel-roller
instead of storming about madly.
“I can’t promise that,” she’d told
Scoones.
Somewhat distressed, she’d tried to
justify her refusal on the ground of
honesty, but Arnold Scoones had been
adamant.
Down in the mint, though, the noise
of his tantrum came to her only remotely ;
life had contracted to a sun-warmed spot
across her shoulders.
Then she heard Scoones’s voice, not
querulous or peremptory, but so cordial
that she knew even before the words
registered that it was not to her he spoke:
“Going to be a good game, Mr.
Twiss?”
Dumbly, she proffered an uprooted
thistle through the pickets. So it had
really been Mr. Twiss’s voice she’d heard.
She was aware of him first as a pair of
stamping football boots as he jigged about
outside the fence, limbering up; while
from under his raincoat, which served
to cover a referee’s jersey and shorts,
purplish turnips of knees came punching
out on a level with her eyes. The sight
appalled her.
“The opening of the season, you know,
Mr. Scoones,” Mr. Twiss answered
heartily, “and an exceptionally early open-
ing, too. So we mustn’t expect too much.”
“They’ve got you out on the job, I see,”
said Scoones.
Posed on the front step, one leg flexed,
he polished at a tan boot, which he
flourished like a boxing-glpve. He Fas a
gangling, saturnine man.
“Yes, indeed. The first time I’ve taken
the field since my college days. And
we’re not getting any younger, Mr.
Scoones.”
Mrs, Scoones, who had been vouch-
safed no more than a curt nod by Mr.
Twiss, was so nettled by her husband’s
precedence that she didn’t bother to get
up off her knees.
“You’re fit though,” said Arnold
Scoones. “I can see by the way you
move you’re what I’d call a pretty fit
man.”
Mr. Twiss giggled modestly. He
lingered at the fence, seemingly appre-
hensive about moving on.
People passing on their way round to
the park were affectedly familiar in their
exchange of greetings with him. For the
afternoon they were trading on common
ground, and the barrier of his drapery-
counter and its cash-register was removed.
An exception was a little girl who
stopped her skipping as she approached.
She eyed the prancing Mr. Twiss dubi-
ously before she sidled into Scoones’s
gateway.
“Have you a message, Leonie?” Mrs.
Scoones asked her coldly.
The child shook her head. “I’ve just
come to play.”
Arnold Scoones was pointing a boot-
brush at his wife. “Me and the wife’s
just had a difference of opinion,” he said,
evidently feeling that some explanation
of her behavior was due. “A domestic
tiff, as you might say.”
“Dear, oh dear,” said Mr. Twiss.
“Nothing serious, I hope.”
“Just in fun,” Mrs. Scoones parried
resentfully. Her speech was slurred as
she tried to hide a broken tooth.
“She was using a chisel on screws,”
Scoones said.
Mrs. Scoones was watching Mr. Twiss’s
expression anxiously.
“A chisel!” he panted, boosting
Scoones’s patronage with lofty disbelief.
“Good gracious.”
Indignation flared up within Mrs.
Scoones.
Scoones gave a rasping laugh, treating
it as a joke now.
“He, he, he,” giggled Mr.
Twiss, as he danced about out-
side the fence.
SNIFFLING, Mrs. Scoones
returned to her weeding.
She’d been deceived. This scof-
fer was the real Mr. Twiss. A
barbarian with purple knees. All
the joy of presenting him with
her harvest-festival marrow had
been killed.
“You won’t need to bother
changing,” Arnold Scoones
observed.

Official story on the bachyround to
HOLDEN
General Motors
New Australian Car
This is more than the story of the new Australian car , Holden . It is the story
of the greatest event in Australian motoring history , . . the birth of a completely
new car a car designed for Australia and built in Australia . . . the first car
made-to-order for this country .
HEN General Motors decided to
design and manufacture a car
specially for Australian conditions, a
survey was first made. This survey
showed that the outstanding charac-
teristics of an Australian car should be
dependability, low first cost, low fuel
consumption, roominess without un-
necessary bulk, good performance on all
roads, smart styling and a nation-wide
service and spare parts availability.
This was the blue-print engineers
worked to . . . this was the challenge to
build an entirely new car which would
answer the needs of most Australians.
The result is Holden —a car which
you will see soon, a car which will open
your eyes to a new conception of value
, . . a value you get in better design,
ample power, surprising economy, real
comfort, new safety and low price.

Holden will set a new standard in

the full resources of General Motors
Corporation, the world’s biggest
manufacturer of automotive products.
General Motors represents a pool of
talent and experience which for years
has led the industry in research, design,
proving ground techniques and manu-
facturing facilities.
Latest Manufacturing Methods
General Motors engineers not only
designed this new car, but planned also
the Australian plants in which it will
be produced. The newly erected manu-
facturing plant at Fishermen’s Bend,
Melbourne, is as advanced as anything
of its kind in the world. Its cost,
including the new mechanised foundry,
exceeds £2,100,000, and the body-build-
ing plant at Woodville, South Australia,
has been completely reorganised by the
additional expenditure of £1,750,000.
New plant, new equipment and new
techniques have been brought to Aus-
tralia to ensure accurate and high-
quality production of a car that can
If is fitting that the new Australian car should bear the name HOLDEN.
For more than 30 years the Holden Motor Body Works of South Australia have
been famous. After the merger with General Motors ( Australia ) Pty. Ltd. in 1931
the Company became General Motors-Holden’s Ltd., and the first Chairman of
Directors was 9 the late Sir Edward Holden, K.B. Fhe HOLDEN car will
worthily carry on a great tradition of Australian industrial development.

proudly take its place beside such
famous General Motors vehicles as
Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac,
Chevrolet and Vauxhall.
Two Years of Testing
The' best and final test of any car is,
of course, in the hands of the owner.
But before General Motors engineers
gave the O.K. to start production, a
number of Holden test cars were run
over a durability route near Melbourne
for nearly two years. This dura-j
bility route closely parallels the General
Motors Proving Ground in America in
the number of miles of different road
surface types. If anything, it is more
severe. Each car was run for at least
50,000 miles in the hard grind of test
driving, estimated to be equal to at
least 200,000 miles of normal owner
driving.
Now Holden is almost ready. It is a
car you’ll like as soon as you see it in a
few weeks’ time. It is a thoroughbred
with a background that no other car
has . . . designed by the best brains in
the industry . . . tested with almost
inconceivable thoroughness . . . built
with the world’s most modern equip-
ment, and backed by all the “know-
how” of General Motors in building over
33,000,000 motor vehicles.

school for children of its repre-
sentatives in New York and
ordered both pupils and teachers
to take the next boat home U.S.
observers noted that this was
not the first move in a remark-
able Russian exodus.
Looking into that exodus,
N. Y. “Daily Mirror” found
that in something like two
months more than 500 Russians
had left for home.
About the same time (before
the closing of the Soviet Con-
sulates in the U.S.) N. Y.
“Times” reported on the
exodus: “Russia is reducing its
Government personnel in this
country and is making life in-
creasingly difficult for American
officials in the Soviet Union, ac-
cording to a report in diplo-
matic quarters. Latest figures by
the State Department show that
Moscow has withdrawn more
than 30 per cent, of its official
personnel from the United States
in the past year.”
The closing of the Consulates
thus merely conformed to an
already-clear line of Soviet
action, regarding which Scripps-
Howard foreign editor William
Philip Simms quoted observers
in Washington as drawing com-
parisons between the general
atmosphere of today and that of
the summer of 1941.
“Japan then was quietly bring-
ing home her citizens living in
the United States. While her en-
voys in Washington were stal-
ling for time Tokyo was being
told that the United States was
divided and helpless. Today
Russians are being evacuated
from the United States, Western
Europe and Berlin. And the
air over Moscow, Berlin, Lon-
don, Paris and Washington is
full of rumors.”
As well, “Textile mills behind
the Iron Curtain are said to be
working overtime on uniforms,
and there are rumors that the
Red Army has been alerted.
Asiatic troops, it is said, are
being brought into European
Russia, defence works are being
constructed between Eastern and
Western Europe.” And so on ;
the Big Four conversations in
Moscow then continuing to drag
along “while observers in Wes-
tern Europe fear Russians pre-
paring to march.”
The conclusion of it all was
that if Russia meant war it
would march soon.
Two Germanys.
A report by a London “Times”
Berlin correspondent suggests
one potent cause of Kremlin
chagrin over Germany.
Noting “Russian nervousness
lest Western Germany, under
the impulse of its own freed re-
sources of manpower and
materials and with the powerful
stimulus of the European Re-
covery Programme, should re-
gain its prosperity and with it
a brighter future,” the corres-
pondent states that “No one can
tour Western Germany with-
out realising how far the rebirth
of confidence has already gone.”
On the other hand, reports
from the Russian zone tell of
“rising anxiety, of the rigors of
work, of the meagreness of the
rations, and of the growing
bitterness directed against the
officials of the Socialist Unity
party [Communist] with their
petty and larger tyrannies.”
Britain’s Strength.
Conclusions reached in an im-
pressive objective article in
American “Foreign Affairs”
analysing Britain’s past and pre-
sent strength (or weakness)
amount to much the same thing
as the old “Punch” joke on it-
self; “ ‘Punch’ isn’t what it used
to be,” and the answer “It never
was.”
The writer —Bernard Brodie,
Associate Professor of Interna-
tional Relations at Yale and
author of Sea Power in the
Machine Age and A Guide to
Naval Strategy —sets against the
spectacle of “the undeniable de-
cline” of “the power of England
so long regarded as a great
and fixed quantity” the view of
the United States and the Soviet
Union, each “unquestionably
able to control militarily very
large sections of the globe” and
each “unquestionably difficult to
conquer even by a coalition of
all the remaining Powers.”
Can that, he asks, now “be
said of England, that England
which on successive occasions
saved herself by her efforts and
Europe by her example? The
example she still provides may
be praiseworthy enough in other
respects, but it no longer appears
to be the kind which can promise
salvation to others.”
By the time of World War I,
the writer shows, Britain’s ascen-
dancy “had long since begun to
wane,” the rivals for that role
being the United States and Ger-
many. On the financial side,
Britain’s “exports of goods and
services were already less in
money value than her imports.”
That war was “the first in her
history in which she was obliged
to maintain great armies con-
tinuously on the Continent, and
it cost her 1,300,000 dead.
Financially, too, she was dealt
a blow from which she never
really recovered. The great con-
tribution of her sea-power has
been generally misunderstood.
The blockade was indeed an im-
portant element in the pressure
which brought Germany to col-
lapse, but historians have too
often overlooked the fact that
without the great Allied opera-
tions ashore the Germans would
scarcely have felt the blockade.
And more important than the
blockade was the availability to
the Western Allies through sea-
power of the resources and
finally the manpower of the
Americas, But the war did not
end without a demonstration
that the submarine had made
Britain’s previously unchallenge-
able maritime supremacy hence-
forth precarious.”
That was further shown in
World War 11, in which “a con-
queror triumphant in Europe
was stopped by Britain at the
water’s edge” while “the re-
sources of the world were pooled
through the instrumentality of
sea-power and concentrated
overwhelmingly against the
continental aggressor,” but in
which there was also “the second
and intensified demonstration of
vital dependence upon the
United States.”
For Britain “the liquidity of
her international financial posi-
tion, impaired enough by World
War I, was at last destroyed by
World War 11. The question
now is not merely whether it
can ever be restored, but whether
it can be restored with a suffi-
cient margin to enable her to
build up substantial military
forces. When we see Great
Britain confessing her financial
inability to maintain the posi-
tion she accepted in Greece and
Turkey or to support her occu-
pation commitments in Ger-
many, when we see her drasti-
cally and continuously cutting
back the personnel of her armed
forces and obliging them to con-
tent themselves almost exclu-
sively with existing materiel,
when we find her scrapping old
capital ships without any pro-
mise of replacing them with
modern types, we are reminded
— N. Y. “Daily News”
"WELL, I STILL HAVE A CROWN LEFT."
that it takes a lot of extra money
to be a World Power. And
money is just what Britain has
not got. It is not rash to say
that Britain’s balance-of-pay-
ments problem is also her great-
est single military problem.”
On Britain’s current recovery
effort, the writer makes a point
applicable to other countries
under similar political-control;
“It is clear that two decades of
depression and two generations
of labor - union preachments
have left their mark on work
habits. The habit of spreading
work as a solution for unem-
ployment conformed nicely with
the impulse to slow down in re-
sentment against the exploita-
tion of the capitalist employer.
Both habit and impulse are now
well-ingrained in the subcon-
scious of the average British
workman. If nationalisation
and a succession of Labor Gov-
ernments can accomplish any-
thing for the British economy,
it will be mostly in terms of
breaking down those attitudes.
On the other hand, if the net
economic effect of Labor rule is
to be a positive one, the regime
wiH have to rid itself of its
singular talent for maximising
inducements to leisure.”
The writer closely examines
the military, naval and other de-
velopments threatening Britain’s
one-time security, along with
some defensive developments
which may favor it (such as
underwater radar, which cbuld
finally put an end to sub-
marines) ; he looks into the
plans, currently popular in mili-
tary thinking in Britain, for a
future British Commonwealth
strategy centred on Africa ; he
concludes that if Britain is to
build up real military power in
the next 10 or 15 years it will
have to be largely subsidised by
the United States:
“The technological progress of
weapons has eroded, if not de-
stroyed, the defensive advantage
which Britain previously enjoyed
from her island position com-
bined with superior sea-power.
That erosion would, in any case,
be serious, but whether it be
fatal or not depends on the re-
sources which the British can
marshal to cope with it. Un-
fortunately, the grave deteriora-
tion in Britain’s economic posi-
tion makes it very dubious that
she will be able unassisted to
command the requisite resources.
The conclusion appears inescap-
able that, standing by herself,
the United Kingdom can no
longer fulfil the functions of a
Great Power. Nor can she be
expected to regain that capacity.
The maximum assistance which
the Dominions and the colonies
could provide—in so far as that
assistance could be counted upon
for the future —would fall far
short of redressing the balance.
And the idea of creating a tightly
integrated defence system out
of the whole Empire is close to
being a pipe-dream.”
For American policy, these
conclusions, the writer holds,
“certainly do not imply that the
United Kingdom and the British
Commonwealth must be written
off as inconsequential partners
in the pursuit of world security.”
The United Kingdom, he allows,
still enjoys the position of
leadership not only in her own
Commonwealth, but also among
the countries of Western Europe.
“Her collaboration is therefore
indispensable for the essential
task of organising the demo-
cracies of Western Europe into
some kind of unified security
system.
“Taken together, those coun-
tries dispose of a population and
fund of resources quite adequate
to make them a real counter-
poise to Soviet power. Their
peoples are technologically
advanced and have proved them-
selves tough. Historically they
have not demonstrated remark-
able unity in their foreign and :
security policies, but the cir-'
cumstances of today may war-
rant expectation of drastic
change in those respects. If we
can presuppose an American
policy which follows in general
the pattern laid down by the
European Recovery Programme
as originally conceived, the pros-
pects are good that economic
viability and strategic cohesion
in Western Europe can both be
accomplished. From the mili-
tary point of view that would be
a gain of fundamental import-
ance. It would be absurdly
wrong to assume that the Soviet
Union is so strong and Western
Europe inherently so weak that
Soviet armies could overrun the
latter area at will.
“The British role,” this Ameri-
can observer concludes, “is thus
a commanding one, and in so
far as its continuation in the
Commonwealth and in Western
Europe depends on an inherit-
ance of prestige, it must be
American policy to buttress
what is left of that prestige. We
must indeed remember that Eng-
land will not again be able to
stand alone against an aggressor
who has triumphed on the Con-
tinent. But what that chiefly
argues for our military and eco-
nomic policy is that she should
not again be called upon to do
so.”
Operation Rathole.
Writing a warning in “La
Vie Financiere,” France’s Rey-
naud declared that Europeans
don't realise the sacrifices the
U.S. taxpayers are making to
aid Europe under the Marshall
Plan, or the danger that these
sacrifices might cease before the
scheduled four years run out.
Evidently Reynaud’s call to a
more Spartan programme does
not accord with the prevailing
mood, which has caused the suc-
cessive downfall of Govern-
ments and has led observers
to doubt whether France ever
can recover from the effects of
the two crushing wars and the
moral-deadening German occu-
pation.
Meanwhile, reports in America
dwell on the failure of all 16
participating nations “to co-
operate among themselves as fast
and as fully as they promised”;
on which Scripps - Howard
foreign editor William Philip
Simms comments that, while the
U.S. “does not intend to
meddle” in any of the countries’
internal affairs, “Congress won’t
keep on appropriating billions of
dollars if it thinks the money is
for an Operation Rathole.”
Even if all the vast sum pro-
posed about $18,000,000,000
altogether—is duly allotted in


No other stimulant

SCHNAPPS
The name “Schnapps” distinguishes a special
type of spirit which is absolutely unique in
character, flavour and aroma.

yearly grants by Congress, the
plan could still fail in its objec-
tive: “Its success or failure de-
pends upon the measure of eco-
nomic co-operatipn Europe it-
self can maintain after 1952.”
And on this, “Already some of
the signs are disquieting. Last-
ing European recovery revolves
around inter - European trade.
Yet, despite all the pump-prim-
ing the United States has done,
and is doing, the stream seems to
be drying up.”
Tito Disease.
Further on the recently-
emphasised theme that the
Kremlin has definite trouble on
it* hands through nationalistic
feeling proving too strong for
Com. ideology in puppet lands,
a report in N. Y. “Herald
Tribune” states that, incredible
as it might seem, the youth sec-
tion of the Communists’ own
Socialist Unity party in Berlin
condemned the Soviet blockade
of the city as a “crime against
humanity.”
Also, “From Hungary there
are reports of real trouble: only
the presence of the Red Army
there prevents open resistance to
the regime. And so it goes,
Everywhere the inbred national-
ism of the people, even within
the Communist parties them-
selves, is weakening the Krem-
lin’s embrace. Even the Chinese
Communist party, most power-
ful of all Communist parties
outside the Soviet Union, has
developed obvious symptoms of
the Tito disease.”
Armed Turks.
civilians. Still more important
is that all Turks, civilians and
soldiers: alike, are convinced of
the Russian threat to their
country. This conviction is aid-
ing the U.S. effort to help the
Turks defend themselves.”
There is another reason for
the high morale and. the Turkish
strength in general: “Political
unity of the Turks against
Russia is such that Soviet agents
are making little or no headway
in their efforts to weaken Turkey
from within. The Communist
party not only is illegal but is
making no progress in the
underground. This is due in
Reported from Ankara, a
“U.S. News and World Report”
account shows that “American
arms are pouring into Turkey,”
where, with other aid also, the
U.S. is building up a strong
“military outpost on Russia’s
flank.”
The aid for that purpose,
listed as $100,000,000, actually is
close to $1,000,000,000 in Value
received, because Turkey is
“getting much surplus equip-
ment from the U.S. armed
forces, marked down to 10 cents
on the dollar or less.”
Some 500 U.S. officers and
men are instructing in Turkey
on the guns, war-planes, tanks,
submarines, etc., supplied, and
as well 'Turkish officers and
men are flocking to training-
schools in the U.S, learning how
to use new equipment. '
“A modem air force, highly
trained in the use of fighters and
attack-bombers,” says the re-
port, “is being developed as the
Turkish answer to Russia’s air-
power. A U.S. air-mission of
100 officers and men under
Major-General Earl S. Hoag is
supervising expenditure on
planes, equipment and training.
American equipment already in
Turkey includes an undisclosed
number of U.S. day- and night-
fighters, attack-bombers and
C-47 transport planes. Most of
these have come to Turkey
aboard three U.S. Navy carriers
that arrived at Turkish ports in
the spring and early summer.”
The strong Turkey thus being
built by American aid “is mak-
ing Russia take a second look
at the armed forces of the
country that bars the way to
Soviet expansion southward.
Russian pressure still is strong
against the Straits linking the
Black Sea with the Mediter-
ranean and against Turkey’s
eastern districts of Kars and
Ardahan. But Russia now is up
against Turkish armed forces
that are growing stronger each
day.”
The report puts the total in
those armed forces at 650,000
men, more than any country in
continental Europe outside
Russia itself. What is more, the
morale of the Turkish armed
forces is high. A correspondent
familiar with soldiers in Italy,
Greece and elsewhere in
Southern Europe finds the aver-
age Turkish soldier a willing
and eager worker, full of en-
thusiasm for his job and confi-
dent of his country’s power to
defend itself against Russia,
“One reason for the high
morale of the Turkish soldier is
that he is fed better than most

“ EXCITING. TO SAY THE LEAST!”
part to the Turkish police
organisation, but in the main to
the anti-Russian convictions of
the Turks themselves.
“The Turks,” the report con-
cludes, “will fight if attacked.
U.S. observers in Turkey believe
the Turks are not only capable
of self-defence, but may carry
the fighting across the Russian
frontier into the oil lands of the
Russian Caucasus. And, if
Russia should attack Turkey,
U.S. bombers would be able to
use Turkish bases within easy
striking distance of Russia’s in-
dustrial centres.
“Summary of the opinion of
observers in Turkey is that
Russia will not risk war, but, in-
stead, will try to by-pass Turkey
by seeking more influence in
Greece,*Palestine and Iran. In
that event the Turks,
strengthened by U.S. military
aid, will remain the guardians
of the Straits.”
Boost for J. Bull.
American Lion-baiters, who
saw the last South African elec-
tions-result as meaning that the
British Empire was falling apart,
may be a little discouraged by
the South African Government
statement on what should be
done with Italy’s former African
colonies.
Mentioning that “Great
Britain and the Dominions
played the major part in the
defeat of Italy and Germany in
the Western Desert,” and refer-
ring specially to El Alamein as
“one of the great turning-points
of the war,” the South African
Government statement added:
“In view of this magnificent
contribution during the war; in
view of the vital historic interest
of Britain in the Mediterranean
basin —an interest which for the
last 100 years and more has
been exercised in the cause of
peace and in resistance to aggres-
sion ; in view, too, of the
progress made by the United
Kingdom as de facto administer-
ing authority in reviving the
shattered economy of the
territory since the war, the Union
Government consider that the
trusteeship of Cyrenaica and
Tripolitania should be allocated
to Great Britain.”
Britain’s Forces.
The “Berlin crisis” was
blamed by Britain’s Labor Gov-
ernment for a temporary suspen-
sion in releases from the armed
forces and in other planned
drastic cuts in J. Bull’s defences.
The comparative defenceless-
ness planned was on traditional
lines of Labor thinking, not only
in Britain. There, as an ex-
ample, it was a Labor crowd
that halted the defending of
Singapore, and, of course, in
Australia it was also a Labor
crowd which, in its single brief
period of power between the
wars, savagely wrecked the Aus-
tralian defence establishment.
N, Y. “Post’s” military
authority George Fielding Eliot
(formerly an Australian), look-
ing into the British Labor Gov-
ernment’s recent performance in
defencelessness, finds that the
planned figure of a total of
1,125,000 men in Britain’s
armed forces for this year had,
in fact, been further cut to an
actual 946,000 men. And for
next year the intention was to
cut down to a total of 571,000
(not counting, however, the
National Service men doing a
year’s training).
“The reductions,” comments
Eliot, “are very severe. The
Air Force has been cut by one-
third from last year’s planned
figure. The Army has been cut
(counting the National Service
men) by about one-half. The
Navy suffered least, probably
because of the profound shock
to public opinion brought about
by the revelation during the
winter of the fact that the Home
Fleet consisted of only one
cruiser and four destroyers, and
that not a single battleship or
large carrier was in full com-
mission.
“This is to be rectified, and by
the end of the current year it is
planned to have four battleships,
eight carriers, 17 cruisers, 52 de-
stroyers, 43 frigates and 34 sub-
marines in active service. The
main force of the Navy will re-
main, as at present, in the Medi-
terranean, but the Home Fleet
will be considerably increased.
The only other major naval
force will be in east Asiatic
waters.”
The Soviet Spread.
Comparing the 1938 map of
Europe with the 1948 map a
writer in N. Y. “Sun” notes that
“the process of assembling
States into a universal State has
been continuous during the 10-
year period;
“In the new universal State
must be included: Albania, Bul-
garia, Czechoslovakia, Finland
(partly), Germany (partly),
Hungary, Poland, Rumania, the
Soviet Union, the Baltic Repub-
lics (Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania),
Yugoslavia. To these European
countries must be added, as in-
cluded in the Eurasian Universal
State: Afghanistan, North
China, including Manchuria,
Korea north of the 38th parallel,
Mongolia.
“The Eurasian Universal State
possesses no linguistic, racial, re-
ligious, historical or economic
homogeneity and must therefore
be held together by force. There
can be no other way. Nor is it
possible to suppose that any
process of assimilation can be
devised which can in any prac-
tical period of time achieve
homogeneity.
“In a non-assimilable uni-
versal State of this type repre-
sentative government is imprac-
tical and dangerous. The police
State exists because there can
be no alternative to it. . ..Cer-
tainly, none of the European
countries listed any longer per-
mit any form, however primi-
tive, of representative govern-
ment, nor is personal liberty of
any kind tolerated,”
That Guilty Feeling.
Nations no less than indi-
viduals suffer bad-conscience
effects, according to speakers at
a London meeting of the Inter-
national Psychoanalytic Associa-
tion.
One of them —Dr. G. R. Har-
greaves—stated that he had re-
cently found in the U.S. an
“enormous sense of guilt about
dropping the atomic bomb on
the Japanese. It pervades the
whole community.”
Dr. Ernest Jones, president of
the association, held that Ger-
many had “never recovered from
her sense of guilt for having
started the First World War, and
she had to do something very
violent to assuage her feeling,
violence being always associated
with guilt.”
Another of the speakers —Dr.
Ives Hendrick, a Harvard Medi-
cal School professor —found a
similar explanation of recent
Russian action, the Russians
having “a guilty feeling growing
out of the destruction of their
own culture in the Bolshevist
revolution.”
Dragnet Digest.
Doublecross Department. —Former
U.S. Under-Secretary of State Sumner
Welles, in N. Y. “Herald Tribune”:
“Notwithstanding the anti-revisionist
assurances Moscow has given Poland,
Germany is saturated with propaganda
that Russia will not merely unite the
Fatherland but also restore sputh-
western Pomerania and Lower Silesia,
which Poland has occupied.”
* * * *
Soviet Fear of Attack. —A shrewd
observer with long experience in the
highest quarters in Europe, Bruce
Lockhart, in a “Foreign Affairs”
article, supports the more favorable
view of Soviet actions in Eastern
Europe: “The universal triumph of
Communism always has been and still
is the goal of every true Communist.
But the Kremlin and, in particular,
Stalin himself have never shown any
inclination to define the timing of
this millennium, and it is still rather
more than an even-money bet that
Russia’s policy of consolidation in
Eastern Europe is dictated more by
fear of being attacked than by the
desire to attack others.”
* * * *
Socialised Coal. —“Like all French
nationalised industries,” comments
London “Times,” “coalmining is
sadly inefficient, with output-a-man
less than threequarters of what it was
before the war.” Which, considering
Britain’s nationalising troubles, shows
that pots can still be rather rude to
kettles.
♦ * * *
War Costs Dollars. —Opposing war
on all counts it can think of, “U.S.
News and World Report” points out,
for instance, that cost of war next
time would be far higher (to the U.S.)
than it was last time: “The last war,
at its peak in 1944, was costing U.S.
about $90,000,000,000 a year. Money
cost of war from December, 1941, to
August, 1945, was $330,000,000,000.
The next war, assuming 12,000,000
men under arms and purchase of the
same amount of munitions as in 1944,
would cost $143,000,000,000 a year at
present prices.”

Newspapers' Television. —On the
principle “If we can’t lick ’em we
can join ’em,” over 100 newspapers
in the U.S. (“Wall-street Journal”
reports) have “set up video [i.e.,
television] stations or are planning
full or partial backing of them.”
Of the 1693 radio stations in the
U.S. 44 per cent, are entirely or
partially .newspaper-owned.

Soviet Anti-Semitism. —The Kremlin
seems to have picked up many
pointers from Hitler, but according to
Igor Gouzenko’s The Iron Curtain
it was ahead of Adolf in one
respect: “Hundreds of thousands
of Jews were ‘purged’ in Soviet Russia
long before the Nazi pogrom started.
Besides those shot, thousands were
sent to concentration camps in Siberia.
In the nine concentration camps
around Serov, for example, almost
one-third of the inmates were Jews.”

German-Soviet * Axis. —Back from
looking into Germany from a trade-
union point of view, an American
labor mission has reported warning
of the likelihood of an alliance be-
tween “an extremely nationalistic
Germany and Soviet Russia.” The
labor mission describes this as “an
outstanding danger.” German trade-
unionists, it reported, believe that
“under present conditions the Mili-
tary Government is turning the natiipn
back to the same forces in its
economic and political life that were
responsible for the rise of Nazi
Germany.” The belief is that such
a Germany would be as ready as a
Communist Germany to link up with
Russia.

Herring Galore. —Whatever cuts
there may be in British-processed
smokes for Australia there’s no like-
lihood of any drop in the supply of
smoked and otherwise treated herring.
London “Times” reports some huge
catches — e.g., 91 boats averaging 43
crans, a total of 4,000,000 fish landed
in one day (or night). The crew of
10 on one boat had a gross return of
£4OO to whack up for one night’s
fishing.

Jap Moral Values. —Yasaka Takagi,
director of the Tokyo University
Library, commenting on Japan in the
course of an American “Foreign
Affairs” article: “The life of the
nation has crumbled. The traditions
of Japanese civilisation have been
mercilessly discarded. Even the
language has undergone a far-reach-
ing modification. The people have
no real confidence in themselves, and
the resulting moral slackness is alarm-
ing. Witness the notorious scandals
among high officials, or the recent
case of cold-blooded poisoning of the
whole staff of a bank by a mysterious
thief, or the criminal ill-treatment and
deaths of more than a hundred babies
in a disreputable lying-in hospital.”
All of which p.-0.-\v. would regard as
f.a.q.

WAR AND THE SOVIET.
It did not need the announcement that
the British Government had decided to
rush forward the preparation of civil
defence to make it clear that the world is
again rubbing shoulders with war. The
world has been close to it for three years
—in fact, since World War II ended —and
there is only one thing which can prevent
war. That is a change of heart on the
part of Russia.
It is clear that the help which that
surly country received from the Western
Allies during the invasion of the U.S.S.R.
by Stalin’s former friend in no way
changed Soviet policy. It is, and always
has been, based on the assumption that
Communism cannot live in a capitalist
world, and that if Soviet Communism is
to survive the capitalist world must be
destroyed.
It is quite obvious that this was Russian
policy during the war as it was before
it. Even when the life of the Kremlin
was being saved with Anglo-American
supplies convoyed through the North
Sea and the Indian Ocean by the
strength of the English-speaking nations’
navies and air forces, the Communist
parties of the world were working like
beavers to loosen the hold of the British
Commonwealth on its integral parts in
Asia and on its friends in Europe ; and
they were working under the tutelage of
Moscow.
If it should come to hostilities, none of
the Governments of the great Western
Powers will have anything to blame them-
selves for save weakness and gullibility.
Never have great nations shown so little
tendency to aggression or to greedy
ambition as have Britain and the United
States in the past three years.
They have been generous to the point
of extravagance to their weaker allies.
They have been trusting to the point of
indiscretion in their relationships with the
shuffling, rumbling Asiatic Power which
has snatched everything offered to
it with a snarl and stolen whatever it
could with a brazenness which Hitler
could not have matched at the peak of
his arrogance. They have withstood with
patience constant provocation, incessant
insult and continual breaches of agree-
ment, combined with actual destructive
organisation within their own borders and
even within their own defence forces and
civil services. They have backed U.N.O.
even in its obvious futility, suffered with
resignation the gradual absorption of the
whole of Eastern Europe and its water-
ways into the Soviet system.
The Russians have contributed nothing
to the stabilisation of post-war Europe.
While the Americans and the British and
their Dominions have been doing all the
giving, they have been engaged in sucking
the fruits of conquest with a rapacity
which would have done credit to
some early Oriental tyrant. They
have stripped Manchuria of indus-
tries and machinery which were the joint
property of the Allies, two of whom did
virtually all the fighting in the Pacific
war. Agreeing to send back home the
Japanese military prisoners who fell into
their hands almost without a shot being
fired, they have kept 500,000 of
them as slaves for the building of
military works intended for offence,
not for defence. They have not only re-
tained German prisoners-of-war, but they
have accepted them as mercenaries for
only one possible purpose—for use
against the very nations which saved them
from conquest by Germany after Stalin-
,grad. They have kidnapped large
numbers of other technicians from
Germany and Austria and packed them
off to the cold north, none know whither
save themselves and their victims, no
doubt to be expended in building Russian
war potential. They have stripped what-
ever country they have occupied of food,
of clothing, of cattle and of grain. And
they have kept up an almost never-ending
chorus of demands for more machinery,
more manpower, more privileges from
their devoted allies of the West while at
the same time trying to corrupt the popu-
lations under Western Allied rule, to
make government under Western
methods impossible and to pave the way
for Communist world insurrection.
That there has been no effort for re-
habilitation of smaller nations by the
Soviet Union might, in normal circum-
stances, be forgiven on the score of its
losses and sufferings. It might ordinarily
be considered a fair thing that a nation
which had lost 7,000,000 dead and much
of its industry in the Allied cause, even
though most of its fatal casualties resulted
from incompetence and reckless disregard
of human life, should not be called on
to provide the resources of a Mar-
shall Plan or be willing to make the kind
of sacrifice which Great Britain has just
now made in giving up £l2O million
in American aid to help the weaker coun-
tries. But Stalin and his friends cannot
disclaim responsibility on the ground of
need while at the same time doing every-
thing in their power to hinder and be-
little the unselfish efforts of others and
to destroy the countries which are making
those efforts.
Russia may be too poor to aid its
neighbors, but it is not too poor to
finance Communist agencies throughout
Asia. It is not too poor to maintain and
arm an immense secret-police force. It
is not too poor to keep up a peace-time
military force which is probably equal
in numbers to the forces of all the rest of
the nations of the world. It is not too
much preoccupied with its own troubles
to carry on an aggressive policy for the
promotion of rebellion, unrest and general
hate and hostility which reaches to the
ends of the earth.
All that the Kremlin does is purposeful,
but “Labor” Governments which have
ruled Britain and some of its Dominions
have been slow in recognising it. They
have accepted, to a large extent, the
Russian-inspired viewpoint that any part
of the British Empire which has a few
loud-mouthed agitators holding the ear of
the press should be allowed “freedom”
from the “British yoke,” and that there
is more safety in socialism than in normal
security measures based on strength.
This attitude of mind has resulted in
the sewing-up of most of the British Navy
in plastic, and in the gutting to the point
of foolish insecurity of the Army and
Air Forces. It has resulted in Australia
in the almost total destruction of our
power to defend ourselves and in the
infiltration of the ruling party in
power with the agents of the enemy. It
has enabled the Soviet Union’s malign
emissaries to acquire footholds in
Southern Asia which threaten the safety
of every British Dominion and colony in
the Pacific. It has brought, in the Indo-
nesian Republic, warlike Communism to
within a couple of hours’ flying-distance
of the Australian coast.
It is a dangerous position —as dan-
gerous as that of 1939 or more so—and
it is about time that public opinion woke
and forced the dallying socialists of
Britain and Australia to realise that pre-
paredness is the only answer to the situa-
tion. Either Russia must be shown that
war is likely to be unpayable, or war it
will be —a confused and horrible war
fought largely against fanatics within the
countries which the Soviet Union seeks
to destroy in the interests of the Com-
munist world revolution.
A People's Business.
Dr. Earle Page produced at a luncheon
address in Sydney the other day some new
and cogent support for the New-States
agitation with which his name has been
associated for nearly 30 years. Sydney
heard, marked it not, and forgot with
all speed. Sydney is used to being called
the metropolitan octopus, and is as little
disposed as ever to take as a reproach
the extension of political power in its
hands, or its indifference to appeals for
voluntary decentralisation of that power.
Earle Page chose a Sydney platform for
delivering himself, probably because the
news-distributing agencies also are con-
centrated there. The community is only
beginning to awaken to the distortion of
the country’s proper and natural growth
threatened by the Chifley Government’s
policy for (1) centralising all administra-
tion at Canberra; (2) enlarging the Par-
liament, and particularly the Senate, by
a means which will give even greater pre-
ponderance to already excessive city in-
fluence ; and (3) planning a new wave of
immigration for the swelling mainly of
city labor resources and city votes.
From viewpoints of national defence,
economic development and a healthy
distribution of political weight in Aus-
tralia, the time is ripe for a full hear-
ing of the New-States agitation. Argu-
ments perhaps are not new; they are
simply more compelling, if only political
ears had not become insensitive to them.
The passage of time has actually strength-
ened the New-States case, and in no wise
more strikingly than in the population-
drift quoted by Dr. Page to show the
effects of political neglect.
What has been happening demo-
graphically in the period between the
1933 and 1947 censuses can, according
to Dr. Page, be shown thus:
. Increase
Natural. Actual. Movement.
N. Q’land 42,000 9000 - 33,000
C. Q’land 22,000 4000 -18,000
S. Q’land 166,000 137,000 29,000
New Eng. 117,000 45,000 72,000
That is to say, the region from Hunter
River to Cape York has lost by departures
150,000 of its natural increase during the
past 14 years. The emigration was
chiefly to Brisbane and Sydney —and, to
a slight extent, to Newcastle.
In the decade 1890-1900, northern and
central Queensland increased in popula-
tion by 32,000 and 17,000 respectively,
or together nearly four times as much as
in the 14 years just passed. The ’nineties
saw the Federation campaign, when the
slogan in north and central Queensland,
then agitating hotly for new States inde-
pendent of Brisbane, was “Federate to
separate.”
But Earle Page’s address did not
argue that a mere subdivision of existing
States would of itself restore that lost
population. Nor is the plea one simply
that, these regions having reached a stage
of political maturity, they are stagnating,
unable to hold their people, because local
self-government is denied them. It goes
deeper than that. In Earle Page’s words;
The creation of new and smaller States is
essential to the maintenance of our
Federal system, to the prevention of a cen-
tralised despotism absorbing all other
powers and menacing the private liberties
of citizens, to the fullest Federal and State
co-operation, and to the relief of the
Federal Government of a large mass of
local functions —thus permitting the con-
centration of the Federal Parliament on
essential national affairs and policy.
He urges—perhaps a little abstractly but
certainly not parochially—that the
system of world government which
men in all countries are discussing
must be on a Federal basis, that it must
permit the most liberal decentralisation or
it can never be accepted, and that the
American and Australian examples con-
tribute to this end important experience
in the division of democratic sovereign
powers. Obviously in Australia the work-
ing of the Federal system calls strongly
for improvement in the light of modern
demands.
The existence of new States would
markedly improve the working of the
Federal system. The two world wars and
the depression have forced an increasing
degree of Federal and State co-operation.
Our future problems will force this co-
operation in wider and wider fields.
He instances the Federal Loan Council,
the Agricultural Council, national health
and medical research, public works and so
forth.
But lack of balance in the States’ in-
fluence upon the development of the
Federal system obtrudes through all of
these, and one illustration is the contest
for voting influence in the Loan Council.
The possibility, always there, that the
Commonwealth Government and two of
the smallest States could outvote the four
chief industrial States, “with ten times
as many people,” is perhaps less likely
than that Loan Council manoeuvres will
continue to be used by N. S. Wales in
pursuit of the policy of dominating the
Federation which has persisted since
Federation began. The conviction has not
yet died out in the other States that the
contest still is, as always, one of N.S.W.
versus the Rest —the chief coal and in-
dustrial area against those whom it can
hold to ransom. Beneath the surface the
fight for decentralisation of political
power is not only against the Common-
wealth, but also against. New South Wales.
“The area from Newcastle to Cape
York,” Page declares, “could easily make
six Victorias, each with as great natural
resources as Victoria.” At least, the
agitation is for a New England cut out
from New South Wales, and for a North
and a Central Queensland separated from
the existing north-east quarter of the
continent. This agitation in the past has
made pretty clear that nothing will ever
really be done without an amendment of
the Constitution to permit the creation
of new States by some other means than
the approval of the existing State Parlia-
ments concerned, the Parliaments being
dominated by interests rigidly opposed to
any such change.
Features of the stalemate are that
there is no provision in the Constitution
for the holding of a popular convention
to revise it, and that to wait on a change
of heart in existing State Governments is
hopeless. It may be that for the mod-
ernisation of the Federal compact, which
seems to be more and more pressing, an
increase in the number of States might
provide a middle way. Certainly the
Chifley Government’s legislation to en-
large the Federal Parliament, and parti-
cularly the provisions for the Senate, has
brought into the limelight the whole ques-
tion of waning representative govern-
ment in distant areas, and made intoler-
able the subordination of national de-
velopment to the selfish interests of the
big cities and of the big unions controlling
their community life.
But, again, there is little hope of relief
through the political parties. The impetus
for reform must come from the areas
which feel the grievance. Federation itself
would never have come, as the leaders of
the ’nineties admitted, without an in-
sistent movement from the people them-
selves—beginning with regional agitation
—which forced the politicians’ hands. It
is for the New-State champions to make
evident the weight of opinion which
alone can succeed—and justify their
cause.
"Vast and Empty."
Every now and then some Federal
Minister or other gallops over the
Queensland or South Australian border,
penetrates the dark mysteries of the
country north-west of Birdsville, is
vaguely though frequently heard from in
odd spots like Darwin and Daly Waters
where the inhabitants, white and other-
wise, gather in awe to bask for a brief
space in the light of his personage, and
presently comes back to the soft south
feeling, like Ulysses, “glad to have
escaped at any rate,” After which a
blessed silence descends until some press-
agent or other runs off a couple of
thousand closely-typed copies purporting
to be a Ministerial statement on the
journey and sends them forth to harried
newspaper editors, accompanied by an
order that they must not be “released”
until a certain date.
One of the latest of these venturesome
explorers is Mr. Dedman, the Minister
for Reconstruction. His invasion of the
north produced a remarkable and original
discovery: his “outstanding impressions”
are of “its vastness and its emptiness,”
that it is “by no means a land of milk
and honey,” and that its “chief physical
obstacles to development are climate and
water.”
Mr. Dedman is surely being unfair
about the climate. After all, he was there
while the south was suffering some of its
coldest weeks on record, when the “philo-
sophy” of his political colleagues ex-
pressed itself in gasless and lightless
homes, and nobody could warm himself
or herself with the humble cup of tea,
and at a time when the balmy north exer-
cises a peculiar attraction upon those
Federal politicians who cannot find an
excuse for being overseas. Perhaps the
Minister got sunburnt while urging the
population of Mataranka not to become
“little capitalists” ; anyhow, that annoy-
ance aside, Mr. Dedman has taken the
north in hand:
The Government has committed itself to
a policy of investigation, in conjunction
with the Queensland and West Australian
Governments, with the object of facilitating
the ultimate development of the area to its
economic limits. Intensive research projects
into the resources and potentialities of the
area are in hand and in some cases are well
advanced. From the information so gathered
plans for development will be formulated
from time to time. Already some progress
has been made, but inevitably major de-
velopments will be conditioned by the
availability of manpower and materials,
both of which are in short supply.
“A policy of investigation” into what?
Into the long-known fact that the north
is “vast and empty,” has been so since the
dawn of Australian settlement, and will
continue to be so while the dreadful Aus-
tralian system of concentrating popula-
tion in already overcrowded cities con-
tinues? Into the long-known and glaring
fact, brought shockingly home to the in-
different south in 1942-43, that an empty
frontier is a standing invitation to alien
races in crowded lands that are actually
closer to Darwin than is Sydney? Into
the fact that the south, and particularly
the politicians of the south, have now got
over the shock and reverted to the pre-
-1942 attitude that Ministerial tours and
subsequent press “releases” relieve them
of any responsibility about the north?
A herd of departmental planners is to
receive instructions to “concentrate efforts”
on “beef-production” —from Canberra !
Heaven help the north! Nobody believes,
of course, that anything will happen ex-
cept that the widely-scattered and hard-
worked station-managers up there will
begin receiving those maddening ques-
tionnaires and things which are the
planners’ stock-in-trade. There is, too,
that grand plan for building a modern
town or something at Darwin, the out-
post that discovered in the flame and
death of enemy bombs what it is to be
a long-neglected and undefended frontier
post and may discover it again before
long.
Australia faces no more important
national problem than that of its northern
areas. If the mixture of nationalism and
Communism now disturbing Asia means
anything to a white race holding a thinly-
peopled continent it means that we have
little time to make ready for the
day when from Asia, whose millions
multiply like our own rabbits, will come
the questing alien. He won’t be stopped
by herds of bullocks or an immigration
notice pasted on a board at Darwin
police-station. Nor will he be stopped
by Mr. Dedman’s Regional Development
Division,
If Mr. Dedman is really concerned by
all the “vastness and emptiness” he saw,
if his dreams are haunted by the future,
he .can ease his mind, help his country
and begin the solution of the problem by
encouraging the movement for a new
State in North Queensland. Such a State,
with its capital at Townsville, Cairns or
Cloncurry, would at once be conscious ,
of the undefended and empty land to the
west, and of the fact that it was a front-
line State from the defence point of view^


PLAIN ENGLISH
Price-control.
From this week Federal price-control
is off and State price-control on. In Vic-
toria, South Australia and Westralia it
will be administered by Liberal Govern-
ments ; in N. S. Wales, Queensland and
Tasmania by “Labor.” But there will
have to be some “merging of minds” to
make the controls workable throughout
the Commonwealth as a whole.
Hie present situation arises from Mr.
Chifley’s annoyance at being refused the
right, in a referendum appeal, to per-
petuate a Federal system of price-control.
Though Canberra apparently hasn’t the
least doubt that it can continue petrol-
rationing and other “controls” until the
end of 1949, Mr. Chifley decided to drop
prices administration as soon as his
socialistic scheme was rebuffed by the
electors. And to drive home his feelings
in the matter he has withdrawn subsidy
payments, with the result that as soon as
subsidised stocks are disposed of there
will be steep rises in the retail price of
most clothing and some foods.
The tax-reductions that have been
made this year will not offset the rise in
living costs expected to follow the with-
drawal of price-subsidies. Canberra
finances will be relieved of subsidy obli-
gations which last year cost the Treasury
£25 million, and which would have been
greater this year. On Australian-made
woollens alone there will be nearly £9
million more to pay, and on imports
other than tea (mostly clothing) the rise
will be £7 million.
These subsidies have been met out of
taxation in the past, and they had the
effect of disguising the inflation that was
taking place in our economy. In aban-
doning them Canberra is at fault mostly
in the way that the resentful act was done.
There should have been a much greater
accompanying reduction in taxation.
The removal of controls from sales
of vacant suburban land and second-hand
cars has long been overdue.
In future there is to be little or no
emphasis on profits-control in State prices
administration, and that is a good thing.
Canberra’s profits-control policy was a
deterrent to increasing efficiency and pro-
duction. As time goes on relaxing price-
controls generally and the waning of sub-
sidy influences will be seen in rising prices
for some things—the inevitable result of
war-time inflation, Canberra’s socialistic
manipulation of finance and the Com-
munist-inspired industrial anarchy. Some
idea of the inflationary forces to be en-
countered will be gathered from the re-
marks of the governor of the Common-
wealth Bank, quoted on page 26.
The N.S.W. Minister'in charge of price-
control has said that it will be his Gov-
ernment’s policy to keep only essential
goods under control. But unless much
firmer action is taken by Premier McGirr
and Mr. Chifley against industrial lawless-
ness on the coalfields, in the steelworks,
the building trades and transport in-
dustries, even essential goods will rise
steeply in price all over the Common-
wealth in the coming months if for no
other reason than that of falling man-
hour production resulting from the
present Communist offensive.
"Victory"?
In Queensland Parliament on September
2 Premier Hanlon denied that he had
entered into “negotiations” with J. Healy,
the Communist Federal secretary of the
Watersiders’ Federation, for the release
of the Communists in the now notorious
picketing cases, and characterised the
allegation by Mr. Pie (Q.P.P.) that he had
done so as “an absolute lie.” As Queens-
land “Hansard” reported it (No. 4, 1948,
page 215): —
Mr. Pie: Mr. Hanlon had a meeting
with Mr. Healy when he was down recently.
Mr. Hanlon: WhaU
Mr. Pie: That is all right. Just recently—
the waterside worker.
Mr. Hanlon: I rise to a point of order.
... .That is an absolute lie, and the hpn.
gentleman has no justification for saying so.
There is not the slightest foundation or
justification or any information that may
be got by anyone that would justify the
statement.
[The Chairman called upon Mr. Pie to
withdraw in view of the denial by the
Premier.]
Mr. Pie: I will say what is reported to
me It is reported that at this meeting
in Sydney or during these talks in Sydney
an arrangement was agreed upon for the
remission of the fines and the release of
these men....
Later, Mr. Hanlon said (page 223):
I did not see Healy; I had no discussion
on this matter during my visit south, ex-
cept with members of the Premiers’ Con-
ference and other Labor members while I
was at Canberra 1 did not see Healy or
anybody connected with the union....
After that the Premier packed his bags
and headed for London. Some mysterious
person had paid the fines of Julius,
Englart and the other Healy, Graham and
Esler were released from jail, and warrants
issued against others were withdrawn.
The Communists held “victory celebra-
tions,” the A.W.U. expressed extreme dis-
pleasure with Mr, Hanlon, and he boarded
ship with accusations of having “split the
party” ringing in his ears.
He had hardly got clear of these waters
when Mr. Pie was up again, this time to
repeat the charge of “negotiation” and
produce a statement attributed to J.
Healy and, according to Mr. Pie, pub-
lished in “Maritime News” and “Labor
News.” A summary of the statement:
J. Healy met Monk (A.C.T.U.) in Sydney
on August 8. Monk told Healy he had
talked with Hanlon and “indicated” that,
provided Healy’s crowd would not call a
general strike in Queensland, Hanlon would
release the men after they had been in jail
“approximately a fortnight.” Monk told
Healy that 'Hanlon had authorised him to
convey that information to Healy, and that
Monk’s and Hanlon’s talks had been
“secret” and the press was not aware of
Monk’s visit to Hanlon. Healy said he
gave an undertaking that the talks would
be “confidential,” except that he would
have to let the wharfies’ federal executive
in on it, also “selected officers” of the
A.E.U., A.R.U., Seamen’s and Ironworkers’
(all Communist-led), as “they were parties
to the decision to recommend strike action
for the release of the men.”
J. Healy said he was sent to Brisbane by
his crowd to see Hanlon and get a definite
undertaking for the release of the men.
He, with Harvey (A.C.T.U.), met Hanlon
in Brisbane on August 10 and Hanlon guar-
anteed release by August 21. (The fines of
Julius, M. Healy and Englart were paid and
they were released on Aug. 19; Graham
BATTLE-DRESS.
“ I’m not keen on wearing it again, but I hope you haven’t let the moths get
into it, Attlee”
and Esler were released on Sept. 2). It was
also agreed that existing Warrants be with-
drawn and no further warrants issued.
Healy denied that the fines were paid
by affected unions or the Communist party
—“lt must be obvious that in view of our
knowledge of the‘Premier’s pledged inten-
tions there was no necessity to consider the
payment of the fines.”
After the release, Monk told Healy that
Hanlon bad explessed surprise at the pay-
ment of the fines. Later, Hanlon told
Monk that Graham and Esler wouldn’t be
released until after Hanlon returned from
the Premiers’ Conference, Healy “raised
strong objections,” and “demanded” that
the A.C.T.U. do something. Monk called
A.C.T.U. Emergency Committee together
and it agreed that Hanlon had committed
a “breach of faith.” Healy said Monk
couldn’t “contact Hanlon,” and he (Healy)
concluded that Hanlon “had no intention
of keeping his pledge” to release the men.
But Monk at last “contacted” Hanlon, and
Hanlon told him the men would be released
and all existing charges withdrawn.
Healy said last Friday that Mr. Pie's
statement was “accurate.” It would, of
course, suit him to say so.
If the Healy report is true, and Monk
hadn’t denied it at the week-end —Hanlon
is in London—the power of the Com-
munists and the weakness of both the
A.C.T.U. and the Hanlon Government
in the face of Communist threats is even
worse than it seemed. It is reasonable to
suppose that the same tactics were tried
on Victorian Premier Hollway when he
smashed a transport strike at the begin-
ning of the year. But the Hollway anti-
strike legislation is still there, ready to be
used when wanted, and Communist sound
and fury left the Hollway withers un-
wrung. Meantime the A.W.U., maker
and unmaker of Queensland “Labor”
Governments and sturdy opponent of
Communism, after an initial burst of in-
dignation is keeping its thoughts—and
possibly its intentions —to itself.
"Labor" Rules the Air.
Mr. Chifley’s announcement of the
Federal Government’s intention to re-
strict frequency-modulation broadcasting
to the national stations only will bring on
another fight for the preservation of
liberties —in this instance, freedom of
speech.
That the Government should be prompt
in taking up overseas developments in an
intelligence service which may be of vital
importance for war communications —
especially if our Allies’ radio equipment
is thus modernised —is right and proper.
But there Mr. Chifley’s justification—not
that he uses this argument—ends. To say
that in Britain the 8.8. C. has a monopoly
of radio-broadcasting is not sufficient
answer to other objections, for the 8.8. C.
is controlled by a jealously independent
Commission.
Mr. Chifley’s refusal to allow com-
mercial radio enterprise to share in the
new experiments, or to be allowed to
operate F.M. when proved, is a further
manifestation of socialistic intent. Radio
is likely to become a propaganda
medium for the “Socialisation in
Ten Years” of all means of production,
distribution and exchange, as demanded
by the “Labor” conference of June, 1944,
and initiated with the Bank Grab Act.
No matter what the public protest, or the
illegality of legislation as declared by
the High Court, the will of a revolution-
ary minority is to be forced on this demo-
cracy. At least, that is the Chifley policy.
The smothering of the people’s voice by
propaganda is necessary in order to
further it.
In this “Golden Age” the only free-
dom of speech Mr. Chifley has professed
to respect is that of the Communist
“philosophers.”
Long-term consequences for the public
may be:
The scrapping of all existing radio-sets if
the national service is to be heard.
The freezing-out and extinction of com-
mercial-service stations in due course by de-
priving them of attraction to advertisers.
The compelling all applications for radio-
time, by any user for any purpose, to submit
to departmental approval, with priority, of
course, for friends of the Government.
To speculate a little further, the aim
being to establish a completely
socialised monopoly, none but Socialist
political propaganda may be heard under
the regime which Mr. Chifley appears to
suppose is entrenched at Canberra indefi-
nitely. Then the day may come when
racing results and tips and s.p. betting
services will be also officially controlled
and dispensed, with Ministerial liaison-
officers probably infesting the race-
courses ; and if that day is not too long
delayed a Governor-General whose ser-
vices to the country as a “Labor” Premier
reached their highest level with the crea-
tion of the Sydney Turf Club will be
able to bestow his vice-regal blessing on,
perhaps, a Government monopoly in
bookmaking.
The A.B.C, signal-tune, though, is un-
likely to be changed from “Advance Aus-
tralia Fair.”
K.O. for "Free" Medicine.
The long-awaited report of the N.Z. Gov-
ernment’s advisory committee on sug-
gested alterations to the Maoriland “free”-
medicine scheme ought to end the pro-
tracted struggle in McKenna’s mind be-
tween his commonsense, which recognised
the B.M.A.’s stand as justified, and his
adherence to the party dogma which de-
clares that on any subject at all Caucus
knows best.
According to the N.Z. official survey
of several years’ experience under the
“free”-medicine scheme, the abuses
alleged by the B.M.A. are real and wide-
spread. The “patient pressure” has im-
pressed the committee as well as alarmed
the doctors ; and the “financial irresponsi-
bility” of “free”-medicine swillers is en-
couraged by the only resort left to the
nationalised doctor in face of “trivial
complaints.”
There is one obvious remedy, human
nature being what it is, as the B.M.A. has
long been telling the Governments, both
here and in Maoriland. Now the N.Z.
Government’s report affirms the doctors’
advice. It suggests as “the most effective
chtck” on abuses that the patient shall
pay at least part of the cost of the
medicine which he or she receives. In
other words, “free” medicine must not be
“free.”
No propaganda can disguise the mis-
chief which has resulted from this
Socialist quackery in N.Z., or the plain
warning now given to the Chifleyites
of the trouble and waste of money
awaiting any repetition of the experi-
ment here. The N.Z. report justifies com-
pletely the professional resistance to the
Chifley-McKenna proposals; and the
B.M.A. can now dig its toes in assured
not only that its stand is right, but that
the public has proof that it is right.
Composers 1 Aid Fund?
The Parliamentary Standing Committee
on Broadcasting has recommended the
establishment of a fund to assist Aus-
tralian music composers, here advocated
(B. 18/2 / ’4B) as an alternative to “liberal
endowments by wealthy citizens,” which
were not forthcoming. The possibility
of their being iipmortalised by association
with a famous work (as was the profli-
gate Count Waldstein, whose reward for
liberal benefactions to Beethoven was to
have a great sonata named after him)
apparently weighs less with more opulent
citizens than the pleasure of seeing some
fiddle-faced brute they own shoot past
the post first at Rahdwick or Flemington.
The committee “thought the aim should
be to provide £50,000 a year for the
fund,” but that “£15,000 would probably
be sufficient for the first year.” This has
a rather familiar ring as applied to Gov-
ernment grants: in one breath, generous
talk; in the next, cheeseparing. Instead
of taking the plunge boldly the commit-
tee proposes to put only a tentative toe
in the cultural waters.
With the exception of such rare and
divinely-inspired geniuses as Mozart and
Schubert, no composer can give rein to
his best creative impulse jf the spectre of
want is parked on his doorstep. Nor
should he be expected to. Grants to
selected men and women should be
generous enough to enable them to live
in comfort, free of ordinary financial
worries, while they work. Moreover, this
endowment is something for which no
quick returns need be looked. Except in
examples of unusual genius musical com-
position is of slow growth. It is a craft
of great ramifications and difficulties,
especially in the scoring for big orchestral
works. The 40 or so sketchbooks left
by Beethoven show what a painstaking
and often painful affair was creation.
The very nature of a composer’s diffi-
culties demands that the beneficiaries
under the fund be treated with becom-
ing generosity.
The other recommendations by the
committee, namely ( a ) a Federal Parlia-
mentary Committee comprising the
leaders of the three parties or their depu-
ties to control the fund ; ( b ) appointment
of five experts to assist the committee ;
(c) establishment of fellowships to assist
persons who have proved their capacity
to do creative work in the field of music,
are logical and sensible.
Britain and the Cams.
Having -had a fair chance to study
socialisation of industry in practice—as
with coal and railways—British trade-
unionists are showing marked reluctance
to urge their Government to go any
further with the notion just yet: a reluc-
tance accentuated by Britain’s internal
condition and the alarming performances
of Communists both at home and just
across the water in France, Germany,
Czechoslovakia and other parts. And
Cripps’s exhortation to work harder re-
ceived a far better hearing than that
accorded a recent Chifley dilation on the
subject.
Cripps said that British exports for
the first half of 1948 were 130 p.c. of the
1938 figure, with a 23 p.c. increase to the
Western Hemisphere, 19 p.c. to other
places and overseas trade generally “in a
much healthier condition.” But it wasn’t
enough. Production must go up and up.
“We must get a lot more per man per
year” to keep down prices and so increase
real wages.
This was to the Trades Union Congress,
which had no sooner heard Cripps than a
J. Gardner arose, said he was a Com-
munist, and moved the “immediate
nationalisation of the steel industry.”
Whereupon, although London “Evening
News” said the Attlee Government had

the steel-nationalisation bill ready for the
special session of Parliament this week,
the congress carried an Iron and
Steel Trades amendment urging the
Government “to go carefully” on steel,
outed a motion for union representation
on the Bank of England directorate, and
another urging the “training of workers
for the management of industry.”
Next day the T.U.C. council was
elected. Only one Communist made it;
four others polled badly, including Arthur
Horner, secretary of the Miners’ Union.
Communist motions urging affiliation
with the World Federation of Trade
Unions and condemning British policy in
Greece were kicked out, and the
W.F.T.U. roundly condemned as
“nothing more than another platform and
instrument of Soviet policy.” It seems
that the good old British standby of
commonsense is getting an innings at last.
POLITICAl Points
Communist terrorists in Malaya
murdered a third Australian last week,
riddling him from ambush while he went
about his work. This is what the Prime
Minister calls “a great upsurge of
nationalism —a rebellion, in many respects
an economic rebellion, against conditions
under which the people are living.” So
speaks the mind of 1917, impervious alike
to murder, threats to national safety and
its own plain duty.
On September 14 “S. M. Herald”
turned out a remarkable story about
Communists and fellow-travellers in
an article headed “This is the Strange
Story of Asian Airlines, Ltd.” It
told of the activities of Clarence Hart
Campbell, one of the owners of Marx
House, Sydney, of the airline company
he proposed to operate to Indonesia and
Malaya, of Catalinas bought from Dis-
posals, and Campbell’s belief that he
could “fix” anything at Canberra as
he knew “enough about a Federal Minis-
ter,” There was more, involving Sharkey
and leading Communists, of their own
and Campbell’s trips to Indonesia and
Malaya, and other startling things, not
the least being the suggestion that the
wharfies’ ban on Dutch shipping was to
ensure a monopoly in sea-carriage with
Indonesia for the Australian-Indonesian
Trading Co., another enterprise with an
alleged capital of 30 million guilders.
“Unorthodox business” was mentioned
as part of the airline’s proposed activities.
The Campbell named in “S. M,
Herald’s” account of Asian Airlines, Ltd.,
used to be seen in lower George-
street, Sydney, about the time the
war ended, leading bunches of Asiatics
in demonstrations and disturbances
in and around the Dutch shipping
offices. When the Prime Minister was
asked about him in Parliament he said
that permits for flights to Malaya and
Indonesia were no concern of the Federal
Government, and on the matter of pass-
ports for Campbell:
Being an ordinary citizen, he received his
passport as a right. I think I did see Mr.
Campbell, who came originally from my
electorate, and I have known him for many
years.
Campbell, on the contrary, is a very
extraordinary citizen. Mr. Chifley should
get a Security report on him.
Victorian wheatgrowers have accepted
Mr. Pollard’s new wheat-stabilisation —
or is it -equalisation?—scheme by a vote
of 11,275 to 3495. It moved the Wheat-
growers’ Federation president to hope
that growers in other States would fol-
low suit. In N.S.W, the big wheat-
growers’ organisation, the Farmers and
Settlers’, is campaigning for a “no” vote ;
it wants the Pollard scheme rejected so
that growers can set up a marketing
scheme of their own.
Canadians) have been chewing Queens-
land pineapples at a rate that makes
the fruit a good dollar-earner. Total ex-
ports to Canada for 1948 are expected to
be worth about two million dollars, or
£A700,000, and if tinplate for canning
can be got 1949 shipments may be worth
2% million dollars. The Geneva trade
conference resulted in pines dropping
from three to two cents per lb. in Imperial
preference,, but a general shortage and a
Canadian quota on Hawaiian fruit offset
that for the time being. If Premier
Hanlon had known about this at the Loan
Council he might have got that railway
into the channel country.
Lang followed up the Asian Airlines
matter in the House last Friday by asking
for the papers on the sales by Disposals
of Catalina aircraft to the fantastic
show, and whether a certain Mr. God-
hard, of the A.L.P. and from the Prime
Minister’s electorate, was a member of the
Disposals Commission and whether Mr.
Godhard
Is a director of the firm that sold its
premises at 695-7 George-street, Sydney, to
the Communist party, one of the nominees
for the Communist party being Clarence
Hart Campbell, managing director of Asian
Airlines, Ltd., who now owns the Catalinas
bought from the Disposals Commission.
The Prime Minister answered that he
couldn’t promise to table departmental
papers, but he “would have inquiries
made.”
Victoria’s willingness to buy a million
tons of Queensland coal a year would be
a good thing for Queensland if the trans-
action were possible, but it’s not. The
coal is there, and Queensland miners
aren’t as difficult as their N.S.W. col-
leagues, but Queensland’s railway facilities
are too primitive for large-scale handling,
even to a near-by port. The rolling-stock
doesn’t exist; if it did, the port facilities
don’t. Victorian offers to help establish
port equipment and so on are encourag-
ing, but they would take years to com-
plete. The big opencut show at Blair
Athol still simmers along while “negotia-
tions” go on about railways and ports.
In this coal-hungry land it’s like a hungry
man who can’t get at the food in the cup-
board because he’s lost the key.
Asked what he intended to do about a
public statement by a Queensland Com-
munist named G. Burns that, in the event
of a war between Soviet Russia and the
Western Powers, the Australian Com-
munists would “fight on the side of Soviet
Russia,” Mr. Chifley said he would ask
the Acting-Attorney-General, Senator
McKenna, to “inquire into the statement.”
A couple of Communist heads tried to
wriggle out of the Burns statement, and
the R.S.L. and a lot of other people
seemed astonished and indignant. Why?
Didn’t the Corns in Australia fight on
Stalin’s side while Stalin and Hitler were
allies from August, 1939, to June, 1941?
Mr. Conciliation Commissioner Gal-
vin, roundly condemning the 8.W.1.U.
executive for the persecution of the
unionist Miller, who dared to inquire
about a balance-sheet, remarked:
It is difficult to understand why the union,
or rather a section of the union, persisted
in its attitude to Miller with its resultant
inconvenience and disruption.
Mr. Galvin may find understanding
difficult; nobody familiar with the way
Communists run these unions is at all
puzzled. The man had dared to criticise,
therefore he had to be bullied or bluffed
into silence. Miller, an Old Digger,
fought back.
One point on which Australian mothers
of young children will agree with Mr.
Dedman, the Minister for Post-war Re-
construction, is his statement in a review
of the leather industry that “There is re-
ported to be considerable accumulation
of stocks in Australia, particularly of
inferior varieties of sole leathers.” Every
mother who pays from 255, to 355. a pair
for kiddies’ shoes that wear out in a
month knows the truth of the last bit.
Wasn’t Mr. Dcdman’s colleague Mr.
Roseveaf Controller of Leather or Foot-
wear or something?
The McGirrs have knocked-back the
Hollways’ invitation to hold an inquiry
into the chances of developing the Eden-
East Gippsland area, the McGirrs’ Mr.
Baddeley informing the Hollways’ Mr.
McDonald that nine Royal Commissions
and Committees had looked into similar
propositions since 1892, and the McGirrs
won’t be interested “unless new factors
emerge.” Meantime a decentralisation
conference has somewhat tartly informed
the Victorian Government that if it is
bursting to develop something outside
Melbourne it can begin with the neglected
western district’s natural port, Portland,
next Monday morning.
Because Professor Copland, who was
Chief Prices Commissioner before he be-
came Vice-Chancellor of the University
which hasn’t yet been built at Canberra,
told a Sydney gathering that “a neat
balance between control and freedom had
to be achieved without recourse to a
repressive social discipline,” the Liberals
seemed to think that he meant to be a
Liberal candidate for the next election.
Casey went so far as to say that Copland
would be a “welcome addition” to the
Canberra Parliament. Well, as most of
those who listen to it know, that would
apply to almost anybody.
On Sept. 11 shipments from the N.
Queensland sugar coast were about 35,000
tons behind schedule, and to complete
shipments for next season about 60,000
tons a month will have to be dispatched.
This season’s crushing should reach
189,000 tons. Only about 18,000 tons of
it had been shipped by August, storages
can accommodate about 85,000 tons, and
what becomes of the rest is anybody’s
guess. Meantime, the turn-round of ves-
sels is getting no better; it took a
week to load the Kanbe with 5000 tons,
using latest mechanical gear, and four
days to load 2600 tons into the Burhill.
After seven years of “Labor’s” “full-
employment” and “Golden Age” theories,
Australia is reduced to the necessity of
importing coal from hard-pressed Britain.
Worse, this demoralised community is
obliged to import prefabricated houses;
under Chifley’s rule cottages for the work-
ing man are too expensive when built
out of local material and by local labor.
A recent Canberra debate came to a
stop and nobody could be got to say
anything when it was learnt that the
show was not on the air. Apparently
members didn’t want their electorates de-
prived of their eloquence. An operation
which prevents dogs from barking has
been applied successfully to American
Army mules to prevent them from bray-
ing—an achievement which may have
some relevancy to the matter under dis
cussion.
Sydney went without its trams last
Sunday, and, according to the trammies,
will continue to do so unless the “Labor”
Transport Minister restores “full ser-
vices.” The “Labor” Transport Minis-
ter hadn’t a word to say, though tram-
less Sundays hit the very people upon
whom his crowd depends for votes.
Stirred at last by the obvious pulling
power of his State for tourists —more
than 40,000 of them spent £2 million
there this year—Queensland’s Home
Affairs Minister Jones has set up a com-
mittee to see what can be done about
providing additional accommodation. As
a starter, local authorities and private
enterprise are to get a 50 p.c. subsidy on
the cost of building tourist facilities.
That’s better than supposing that only
the Government is capable of providing
these things.
An argument advanced -in favor of a
bigger Federal Parliament was that it
would mean a higher standard of
members. Judging by hints already
thrown out most of the “new” men will
coma from the State Houses, leaving
those legislatures the task of finding clean
skins—which, aftet, all, might be all to
the good of the States.
The N.S.W. Government “has approved
the issue of a marriage guide to young
people contemplating marriage.” Where
they shall live when married isn’t ex-
plained.
The “Golden Age” Treasurer has
assured those who have said they “won’t
work overtime for Chifley” that “in no
circumstances does taxation absorb the
whole of the additional earnings.” “Why,”
says he, “a single man has only one-
quarter of his overtime (at time and a
half) taken away from him, and a married
man is let off with eightpence less!”
What more can either want as an in-
centive to work longer hours?
U.N.O. is holding “ground-breaking”
ceremonies to celebrate the start of its
£20,000,000 building at Midtown, Man-
hattan, which is to be finished in 1950,
As U.N.O. promises to be also finished
by that time, the £160,000 excavation
which is the first step in the work will
probably be all that is needed, and what-
ever is raised above ground-level will
be added to Geneva’s League of Nations
Palace as a monument to the futility of
busybodying and gabble.
By Australian standards the Re-
publican candidate for U.S. Vice-President
is unique, and so is his State.
With two million more people than
Australia, and more than three times
as many as N. S. Wales, California gets
along with 145 politicians—4o State and
two Federal Senators, 80 State Assembly-
men and 23 Federal Ms.H.R. N. S.
Wales has 184 —150 State and 34 Federal
—and is to have 23 more Federals if
Chifley and Evatt can bring it off. As
for Warren, Republicans and Democrats
ran him for Governor, and as such,
though “the roots of his lifd are in
Labor,” he has “tried to induce Labor to
see its interest in the light of a larger
interest”:
Despite the pressure of Labor leaders,
he permitted an anti-secondary-boycott bill
to become law, and he signed a bill out-
lawing jurisdictional strikes. He then went
before a Labor convention and appealed
successfully to the rank and file over the
heads of the leaders. , '
No Australian politician “with the roots
of his life in Labor” has ever been
known to do anything like that.
Births in the Commonwealth for the
first quarter of this year were at the
rate of 22.85 per thousand of mean popu-
lation, a decline on last year’s figures.
Japan’s birthrate last year was 34.8.
Asked by the Federal Export Advisory
Committee —whatever that may be —to
suggest ways of increasing pearlshell ex-
ports to “hard-currency” areas, the W.A,
pearling industry promptly snorted that
high taxation, labor regulations, high
costs and other “benefits” of Federal
Labor rule were crippling the industry.
What’s more, the W.A, pearlers sourly
reminded the F.E.A.C, that pearlers in
N.T. waters were exempt from income
tax, whereas they had to part up. The
F.E.A.C. has gone up the Molonglo
somewhere to meditate.
Melbourne doctors have told a 77-year-
old contortionist that he will probably
die if he stops contorting. That’s a bad
look-out (or is it?) for political reform.
Among the welter of suggestions put
forward lately for increasing coal out-
put—they cover a range of ideas, from
giving the miners free football jerseys to
opening up new mines in five years’ time
—no one seems to dare hint at introduc-
ing a second shift, although the Davidson
report pointed out Its obvious benefits.
The coal is there 24 hours a day ; the
demand is there 24 hours a day; yet
work goes on, when it goes on at all, for
only eight. As to labor, Poles and Balts
are being sent to the canefields, fruit-
growing districts and other areas, but
there’s not a word from Calwell, Chifley
or anyone else about using them to dig
.coal. The Comrades don’t like displaced
Poles and Balts —they stigmatise them all
as Fascists —and more important still,
they don’t want to see more coal won.

“Also Ran”: A Judge in Brisbane re-
cently objected to the term "de facto

it was pointed out to him that the words
were used in Commonwealth legislation.
However, there may be a place for it in
our language. Our de facto wharfies re-
fuse to load cargo and our de facto crews
refuse to take the ships to sea for lack of
coal which our de facto miners haven’t
mined. But a word will be needed to
describe the children of a man and his
de facto wife. I will invent one, but just
now the neighbor’s dog is digging a hole

“Mac Hoots”: I am sorry to see the
N.S.W. Forestry Advisory Council, which
would not harm a fly, joining the company
of witch-burners: those who would ban
a book. Because it read in H. A.
Lindsay’s Bushman’s Handbook some
instructions on how to snare wild duck
with a fish-hook the council has asked
that the book be banned. Since the volume
is neither treasonable nor obscene I don’t
see how anybody would have the power
to ban it; but the instructions in any
case were meant only for people lost in
the bush, and Mr. Lindsay, as president
of the Adelaide Bushwalkers, probably
loves the bush and its creatures just as
much as the members of the council. The
council might remember that Australian
authors are a form of wild life much
more in need of preservation at the
moment than those few black duck or teal
likely to be snared with fish-hooks by
lost hikers.

speciality for the bibulously-undiscerning
or obviously hurried customer that is a
winner, and makes the rabbit-out-of-the-
hat conjuror look silly. His technique is
to cut open a roll, spread it liberally with
tomato-sauce, fold it dexterously around
his finger, hold it aloft while he takes
the money with his other hand —then
withdraw the finger smartly and start the
operation all over again. That grimy

“Yipe”: Some overseas broadcasting
studios have found that they capture an
impressive “listener’s interest” by featur-
ing unrehearsed interviews with children,
but the practice is hard on the nerves of
broadcasting technicians. They have to
be always poised to cut off some remark,
innocent enough to the child who makes
it, but liable to stun his parents or the
censor. A youngster who said his father
was the advertising manager of a big
mattress company had done so well
in the interview that as reward he
was allowed to give his father’s firm a
boost on the air. With a verbal flourish
he announced “Sleeping on our mattress
is like sleeping on a cloud.” He then
floored the compere by adding: “At

“Lever de Rideau”: Previous opera
seasons have been more cosmopolitan
than the present frenzy at His Majesty’s,
Melbourne, which is almost exclusively
Italian. Australians like John Brownlee,
Austral and Melba, plus Argentinians and
Germans, imparted a pleasing racial
mixture; but there has been none to
equal the Australian season of 1931,
which, its promoters hoped, would, like
the recent National Theatre movement,
lay the foundations of an indigenous in-
stitution. His Majesty’s having been
burned to the ground, the locale was
shifted to the Royal, and the season
started off with “Carmen,” a Spanish
opera written by a Frenchman and sung
in French by Joseph Hislop, a Scotsman ;
in his native tongue by Franco Izal, an
Italian; in English by Phyllis Ferguson,
an Australian ; in her native tongue by
Orff-Solscher, a German; and by the
chorus in all the dialects from Toorak to
Fitzroy. The conductor was Bernard
Heinze.

“Pawang”: My long-held belief that
beer builds up the resistance is confirmed
by a report by the Commonwealth
Pathologist on the state of the sink water
used for washing glasses in more than
40 of 65 hostelries inspected in
Hobart. From a bacteriological point
of view the washing .water in 28
cases was astounding. Water from
one hotel contained 12,000 organ-
isms per millimetre, most of them prob-
ably of human origin, which compares
very badly with the average monthly
population of 40 organisms in the water-
supply of the city. Melbourne, with one
of the purest supplies of drinking water
in the world, has four. The consistent
beer-imbiber must absorb an incredible
number of wogs in the course of
his daily struggle for a refresher in the
bars of Hobart and Melbourne, while the
water-drinker, who usually takes his
tipple in the environment of a well-
ordered home run by a cleanliness-
obsessed housewife, runs scarcely any
risk whatever. Yet there is no evidence
to show that water-drinkers are any
healthier than beer-drinkers, live longer
or happier lives or are less prone to catch
infections. The pathologists will tell you
that beer isn’t a prophylactic agent, so it
must be the psychological ingredient
which saves the beer-drinkers from being
liquidated in a single generation.

“Spokeshave”; Melbourne “Herald”
claimed to have made press history when,
the other day, a radio-telephone service
"Will I leave the Water in for you, missus ?”
was used by a roving reporter to transmit
a story to the paper while his car was
travelling to the city. His story was
much more interesting, however, than this
manifestation of progress on the part of
the “ ’Erald.” A seven-year-old girl had
been reported missing from her home at
Hampton after she had failed to return
from school. Police and civilians were
still searching the country round next
day when it occurred to someone to ask
teacher if she had seen the missing infant.
She was sitting in her class as usual.

“Gravelsnatcher”: Somewhere in
Bavaria there’s a farmer who would en-
dorse the Westralian applegrowers’
recently-expressed opinion that a bumper
crop should follow last year’s meagre
harvest. The farmer had assigned to
“Blast that kangaroo rug!”
him an Australian p.-0.-w. with original
ideas and supreme confidence, who
readily accepted the task of pruning the
apple-trees on the other side of the vil-
lage. German apple-trees are big, and
their pruning is not a five-minute task ;
but when, after three days’ work, the
“hand” requested the use of a wagon
to remove the prunings the entire house-
hold gathered itself together and hurried
to the orchard. There, while the women
kneeled to pray that the sawn-off buds
be restored, the old farmer chased the
p.-0.-w. three times around the block
with a pruning-hook. It was months be-
for the strained atmosphere relaxed, and
there wasn’t an apple on those trees that
harvest. But the following crop was a
record.

“dooter”; I dare say the brain re-
sponsible for deciding that henceforth ail
mail for country towns in N.S.W. should
bear a Albury S3-so that
sorters will know what “geographical
division and subdivision” the article is
intended for has his reasons, but the pub-
lished one, that it is “because of the in-
crease iu the volume of mail,” doesn’t
satisfy me. The 1947 census figures show
that the population outside the Sydney
area has declined since 1933, which
argues that those who do remain are
writing and receiving more mail than be-
fore. Of course the stream of Govern-
ment forms that pass through the post-
office must have had an effect; all the
same, it would be natural to assume that
as the city population has increased the
symbolic address should have been in-
troduced there. The new system means
a lot more work for mail-order con-
corns and others with a large intra-State
correspondence, since it will be neces-
sary to have lists of all post towns
and their symbols handy, and mil-
lions of new address-labels will have to
be printed. And there’ll be a lot of run-
ning around and looking up things when
Mum, from Bogan Gate, on holidays at
Narooma, wants to write to Uncle at
Piangil. Still, I suppose somebody must
suffer in the cause of progress.

“Ray Whiting”; She was a good party
in that Palestine camp on New Year’s
Day, 1943, We sank our beer and turkey
to the strains of an orchestra of a dozen
sappers perched on a Wog mule-cart
playing a collection of Itie instruments
which were to have thrummed Mussolini
into Cairo. When the C.O. and the
adjutant unhitched the mules and raced
through the lines the din was magnificent,
while the way those mokes took the slit-
trenches and tent-ropes —well! A day
or so later the revelry had almost sub-
sided when, in the small hours, a loud
bang rocked the camp. With the same
initiative that a few weeks before had
cleaned up Rommel’s minefields, the
sappers had removed a wall of the canteen
with “jelly” and vanished into the orange-
grove with 2000 bottles of good Aussie
beer.
* * * *
“Uramao”; When Maoriland’s Jock
McKenzie, under his Land for Settlements
Act half a century ago, had inserted in
the terms of lease the clause for 999 years,
it was thought that would retain the
State’s interest in the land without giving
the tenant a headache concerning re-
newal. But in the Lands Office in
Dunedin is a properly-drawn lease for
10,000 years. It concerns a right-of-way
between the Bank of New Zealand and
the adjacent property in the Scotch-
byterian city of Dunedin. The area in-
volved is nineteen-hundredths of a pole.
The question -of leasehold versus free-
hold hasn’t yet begun to agitate the parties
involved.

“Craiser”: I have often wondered how
Shakspeare’s rolling numbers were trans-
lated into foreign tongues. I know now.
In Singapore, where the Olivier film
“Hamlet” has broken all records with a
10-days screening and audiences of
30,000, mainly Chinese, Elizabethan
hexameters 'were translated into 3070
Chinese ideographs. When the melan-
choly Dane tirades against his mother—
“l will speak daggers, but use none”—
the Celestial, interpreter made it “Hamlet
will reprove his mother, but will not use
physical violence.”
* * * *
“Hamfat”: There is sometimes a
nightmarish feeling about the quick-
studied part (B. 1/9/’4B). I was
called upon to play George Fenton in
“The Octoroon” at a few hours’ notice
and without rehearsal —without actually
having seen the play. George is a sickly
part, with an inordinate number of exits
and entries and picking up cues from
other people’s long speeches—the sort of
disjointed part that is much harder to
learn than one that moves straight ahead ;
and to help me out I had slips of the
dialogue pasted on to the back of scenery
near the stipulated entrances so that I
could refresh my memory. Unfortunately
the stage mechanics had been enjoying an
alcoholiday, and they set the wings and
other pieces of scenery in the wrong
places, some of it up-ended. I spent a
frantic night dashing round backstage to
pick up my lines, usually finding the
wrong ones. But the part earned me a
rattling good notice. According to the
critic I gave “an admirable picture of a
young man distraught by his love and his
inability effectively to fight for the un-
fortunate Zoe.” The chap, of course, did
not know what I was distraught about.
THE NIZAM OF HYDERABAD.
“Hyderabad, the only Indian State which has re-
fused to become part of either India or Pakistan,
having been invaded by the former, an action which
threatens terrible consequences, renewed attention
is centred on the Nizam, about whom little is known,
except that he is said to be the richest man in
the world.”
Consider the potentate said to be worth
More than anyone else on the face of the earth
The Rajah whose riches, so rumor declares,
Might waken the envy of Yank millionaires,
A claim you may credit or not, as you list,
Since on subjects like this no statistics exist;
Still, none will contest he’s an affluent lad,
■ The Mizam who lords it in Hyderabad.
It’s hardly the job that a Moslem would choose
With live out of six of his subjects Hindus,
Yet he holds it by birthright, it’s well under-
stood,
A post that he couldn’t resign if he would.
And he’s always been reckoned, it seems, on the
whole
A fairly enlightened and tolerant soul.
Of neighboring States there are few haven’t had
Worse heads than the Nizam of Hyderabad.
Too many such princes, there isn’t a doubt.
Are happiest flinging their money about,
Dashing over to Europe at times for a spree
And lacing rare bubbly with old eau-de-vie,
Monte Carlo frequenting and places like these.
Or giving divorce courts a turn as co-res.
Such pranks may appeal to the giddy and mad
But not to the Nizam of Hyderabad.
At sixty, it surely a mention is worth
That he’s never been out of the land of his
birth,
And seldom absented himself from the realm
Of which he devotedly stands at the helm.
Or even emerged from his palace indeed
Except for devotions required by his creed.
No yielding to folly or frolic or fad
Is found in the Nizam of Hyderabad.
A Croesus for money, you’ll note if you sift
His record he’s also a Tyson for thrift.
Since his tucker, impartial authorities say,
Sets him back for no more than two shillings
a day.
Which is all I have managed to gather, my
friends,
Of the Indian on whom such a lot now depends,
Who must shoulder a burden so sore and so sad,
The opulent Nizam of Hyderabad.

“Bo”: My, my! How easily the
marital waters can be ruffled! She was
clinging ingratiatingly to his arm as they
went through the big department store.
“Oh, I’d love one of those straw cart-
wheel hats in the new toast shade,” she
said, as her eye fell on a row of models.
It looked as if his defences were down
when he came back with: “Well, if you
want one I suppose you can have one.
Which is the toast shade?” She pointed
one out, but he shook his head. “Doesn’t
look like the color of toast to me,” he
commented. “Of course it is,” she in-
sisted, When he still maintained his doubt
her voice had the barest edge to it as she
said “But, dear, it is —you must be getting
color-blind. Which do you think is the
toast-colored one?” He pointed to a hat
that was of jet-black straw. They were
going at it hammer and tongs as I got in
the lift.

“Left Hook,” with alternatives:
The desperate efforts to prevent Mr. Wren’s
Sydney Stadium from being demolished or re-
moved or overrun by the new Eastern Suburbs
railway excite my sympathy. Some people say.
that no such excitement was aroused by the
Quay railway wiping out the rather impressive
Maritime Services building; but that’s merely a
stone building that has been a Quay landmark
for years. You can’t compare it with the hand-
some tin-and-brick structure, superbly decorated
with movie and patent-medicine posters, which
stands at Rushcutter Bay. Think of the blood
and sweat expended within its sacred walls, the
roly-polies and the pugs who have suffered in
its cause, the tons of peanuts and prawns con-
sumed therein, the dead marines, the traffic
jams, the brawls—what a contribution to clean
sport and culture it has made! It is obviously
highly valued by the McGirr Government, and
1 am sure that the Premier and every member
of his Cabinet would support the idea to move
it to, say, Neilsen Park, where it could be
placed in beautiful surroundings and take on
added lustre from the near-by historic Vaucluse
House, Wentworth’s Tomb and that resting-
place of the great, South Head Cemetery. All
that would be needed would be a tramline down
Vaucluse-road, the building of two or three
handsome pubs on near-by corners—transfer of
the licences would present no difficulty, whether
or not families were dehoused. There is another
suggestion that Sydney High School be taken
over for a Stadium, still another that Crown-
street Hospital be used; but I favor the Neilsen
Park site. In any event, it would be a dreadful
thing to run a railway through it regardless and
curtly advise Mr. Wren to go and build a
stoush-house somewhere else. Suppose Mr.
Wren took offence!

“Glenroy”: The prefabricated houses
that are being brought to Australia to
serve the needs of married tradesman-
immigrants from Britain won’t be the
first of their type to be imported here.
Over a century ago this sort of dwelling
was being made in wood and iron.
Governor Latrobe brought his house
the Chalet to Melbourne in sections. So
did Captain Lonsdale. Sir Thomas
Mitchell, the explorer, spoke of “Man-
ning of Holborn” who made a business
of building wooden houses in sections for
use in Australia. He could prepare a five-
roomed house for £125 (freight out £3O)
at two weeks’ notice. Georgina McCrae
in her journal mentions an early Mel-
bourne settler who imported from Tas-
mania a two-storied house with a front
verandah. Wingecarribbee House, Bowral
(N.S.W.), the old home of the Oxley
family, an iron building, came from Eng-
land in sections, as did the N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council facade. Many iron houses
were shipped to India. /

“G. Iris”: The Dick Turpin case has
brought with it an echo of the Highett
(Vic.) railway station tragedy of 1932,
when a policeman was seriously
wounded, a criminal shot dead arid his
Chinese accomplice arrested and later
sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment. The
policeman was Chris Coe, the private
investigator in the Dick Turpin case. He
was awarded the King’s Medal for valor.
He retired from the Force two years ago.

“B. A. Ker”: Of course it’s an admis-
sion of feeble intellect, but I confess that
modern advertising bewilders me. For
instance, when an egg was not to be
bought or begged in the environs of Syd-
ney some philanthropist paid (presum-
ably) the N.S.W. Railways Department
for the privilege of pasting signs on the
windows of suburban carriages. The
signs bore three words: “Eggs For
Energy.” Overlooking the fact that a
vast amount of energy would necessarily
have been expended in the effort to buy
an egg in order to acquire the said
energy, would those three words have in-
“ There's something in the twin-bed idea after all.”
spired most readers to dash out and buy
eggs if they had been available —or am
I devoid of human emotions? Then,
too, there is this National Quiz business.
In my subnormality I can sit in front of
the radio and take a stab at guessing
who did what, when, yet feel no over-
whelming impulse to subscribe my beer-
money to Government loans. Now,
film advertising is different, I recently
saw a short that turned out to be an
ad. for a breakfast cereal. The film
concluded: “One plateful contains more
nutriment than three eggs” (flash of three
eggs), “or five sausages” (flash of five
fried snorks). Now, that ad. did ring a
bell. Gosh, what I could have done to
those sizzling, nut-brown sausages!

• “M. 8”: Among the herds of N.S.W.
kids who went back to school last week
was a rotund 13-year-old of Botany
who’d had a real adventure. Fishing off
a coal pier, he hauled up an octopus,
saw that it had something clasped in its
tentacles and was about to dispatch it
with an iron bar when he recognised its
“victim” as a hand-grenade. Being a
youth of admirable discernment and
aplomb, he warned-off all his mates, saw
that the firing-pin was in the safety posi-
tion, gathered up the grenade and took
it to the police. The thing was found to
be ready for action and capable of ex-
ploding. The police were reported as
suggesting that it was a war souvenir
somebody had thrown away. My guess
is that some person tried it out to blow up
fish but forgot, or didn’t know enough,
to pull the pin. Anyhow, the finder
achieved fame in his own circle equal to
getting Bradman’s autograph or smoking
a cigar without getting sick.

“Lofty”: When a tenor can smash'a
glass with his voice he is considered to
have arrived. If the glass ever does
break under the vocal assaults of a singer
the damage is done by the inaudible
sounds —the same sound-waves that
chemists use to mix oil and water and
with which they expect to work other
miracles. An example of the power of
sound-waves was seen when Westinghouse
Laboratories were experimenting with the
jet engine. When they first started it
up the windows of the main building
began to break. By the time someone
took a tumble and had the engine stopped
100 windows had been smashed,
♦ * # *
“Zake”: That the cause celebre trans-
mogrifies an ordinary common-or-garden
sordid murder into something of lasting
quality is given point by the efforts to
have the Lord Chamberlain ban two
plays, one currently running, one pro-
jected, on the Thompson-Bywaters case
which stirred England 26 years ago. The
appellant is the victim’s brother, who
claims that since the murder his life “has
been made a hell—nobody has allowed
me to forget.” The feature of the case
that aroused the public in 1922 was the
production of the letters written by the
victim’s wife to her paramour, Bywaters.
They were far from literary masterpieces
—they were very ordinary letters in fact.
But they clearly demonstrated the writer’s
various unsuccessful attempts to poison
her inconvenient husband. She literally
wrote her own death-warrant. If any-
thing demonstrated the danger of the
written word these did. She expected By-
waters to destroy the damning letters—
she had destroyed his. Unaccountably he
kept them, and, despite a vigorous and
able defence of her by Sir Henry Curtis-
Bennett, who sought to prove that al-
though she was a party to previous
attempts on her husband’s life she was
unaware that Bywaters intended to stab
him as the Thompsons were returning
home from the theatre late at night, she
was found guilty with her lover. Appeal
against the conviction to the Court of
Criminal Appeal failed, and the Home
Secretary refused a reprieve. The pair
were hanged.
* * * ♦
“Cauboy”: Has any opera had a more
curious history than Verdi’s “Un Ballo
in Maschera” (B. 8/9/’48), done on pre-
vious occasions, but omitted from the
programme of the present season at His
Majesty’s, Melbourne? The title Verdi
gave it was “Gustave III,” the scene was
laid in Sweden and the event depicted
was the assassination of the monarch of
that name, who was shot in the back at
a masked ball at Stockholm in 1792.
While the opera was in rehearsal at
Naples in 1858 an Italian revolutionary
named Orsini had the bad taste to take
a similar shot at Napoleon III. The
Italian authorities promptly forbade the
performance; but the opera and politics
are taken very seriously in Naples, and
the mob paraded the streets bellowing
“Viva Verdi,” a slogan which had more
meaning than appeared on the surface,
as the letters of the composer’s name
formed a cryptogram for Vittorio Em-
manuele Re d’ltalia — i.e-, Victor Em-
manuel, King of Italy. The title of the
opera was then changed to “Un Ballo in
Maschera,” the scene changed to Boston
and the murdered king transmogrified to
the English governor of that city, much
to the astonishment of Bostonians when
the play was performed there a decade
or so later.
* * * *
“Dee”: The natural-enough concentra-
tion on water supplies by settlement-
founders and pioneers (B. 1/9/’4B) has
in more places than one left posterity
with an unlimited headache. Sydney is
the prize example. Governor Phillip was,
by the standards of his day, doing the
right thing in plunking a settlement down
alongside the Tank Stream, and for a
long time nobody questioned his judg-
ment. Phillip could not have foreseen
that out of his mud-daubs would grow
a Jong, thin, herring-gutted city rigidly
bounded by water on two sides and
largely on a third, setting up problems of
transport, apart from natural city-growth,
which have baffled the best minds of two
generations. Had the main waterfront
of the city proper been located even at
Farm Cove, Sydney would have been a
different place. Fresh water and the
advantage of water-transport have caused
nearly all Australian cities and coastal
townships to be built beside rivers, and
in the humid coastal climate riverside life
adds measurably to the discomfort of
summer, while you only have to drive
around Brisbane to see what a crazy
pattern has emerged from the effort to
build a modern city in conformity with
the lawless windings of the Brisbane
River,

“Karrimba”: The English “J,” so
elusive to the Scandinavian and ap-
parently to the Afrikaner (B. 4/8/’4B),
was never so much in evidence as in the
days when the windjammer grain-fleet
used to invade the waters of Spencer’s
Gulf, S.A. One weatherbeaten old
skipper, a Finn, always handed out the
invitation to “Come and have a yin an’
yinyer with Yeorg,” the local Bung, at
whose establishment he would, after
several of the same, berate the irrespon-
sible among his crew with: “Here am
l, short of men, while dey loaf in yail.”
* * * •
“Pitt St.”: Hard as it was to drive a
car about Sydney a year or two ago,
trying to remember which were and were
not one-way traffic streets and whether
turns could be made and at what times,
it’s a dashed sight worse now with all
the road repairs going on. You turn
gaily into a street and run into a barri-
cade guarding a shallow ’chasm, back
and go up a lane, only to meet a tram-
way gang with red flags and stacks of
rails, I had a fellow-feeling for the chap
who came down a street, found it blocked
and with a disgusted “Blast!” left his
car and set out to walk. Two minutes
later a parking-cop was branding hisi
wheel.
* * * *
“Flight Deck”: Those Fireflies and
Sea Furies our new carriers will bring as
their broods, though not in the jet class,
are still handy planes. The first is a
long-range sea-reconnaissance fighter
armed with four 20mm. cannon in the
wings, plus rocket-projecting gear firing
16 601 b. explosive heads. (*A modern
Fleet destroyer’s full broadside mounts
six 401 b. shells.) Speed is about 390
m. with a maximum range of over
1000 miles. The Fury is faster (440
m.p.h.), but with shorter range. Gannon
for both craft are the same, and the Fury
can carry 12 Sin. rockets or four rockets
with 1801 b. heads —a 6in. cruiser’s shell
weighs considerably less. Both craft are
fitted with the latest radio, radar, identi-
fication and night-flying equipment.

It’s strange that any character’s depiction

A patent slur is cast upon them, too,

THE SERVIE MAN
Europe and Australia's
Fifth Column.
“Ek Dum”: It is now certain
that all attempts to compose an
arrangement with the Soviet
Union leaders about Berlin and
Western Europe have failed.
About all important matters
outstanding from World War
II there i§ a complete dead-
lock —about the essential pro-
grammes of U.N.0., about the
Japanese, German and Austrian
peace treaties, about the Medi-
terranean and Greece and the
Middle Eastern situation, about
Mdnchuria and Korea and In-
donesia.
There is grave danger of war,
and even fear in some respon-
sible quarters that the Russians
are only waiting for the months
of snow and blizzard which will
make bombing of their own
cities difficult before* they launch
their rolling columns of gun-
fodder upon Germany, Austria
and France and the Scandinavian
countries, as well as Italy.
Western defences -on land and
sea are small and food and cloth-
ing supplies low. Some of the
countries affected are honey-
combed through and through
with Communists. Nobody in
the Western area is anxious to
fight. There is none of the fierce
lift of indignation which made
it possible to keep the war mov-
ing from the beginning in 1939.
The condemnations of Russian
policy which appear in some
papers have a furtive sound, as
if editors had so long been the
dupes of Moscow policy that they
felt a sort of reluctance to attack
an old friend and associate.
Australia’s defensive position
is perhaps the worst in the
world. Despite the brave words
of the Prime Minister about
“arrangements” and “co-ordina-
tion” With Britain, the truth is
that a brigade of well-armed
“ Don't keep saying her husband looks a new man —he IS
a new man.”
paratroop guerrillas with air
cover could establish themselves
in parts of the country at any
moment. It was announced
within a few days past that there
are not the men available —two
companies only—to guard a
couple of large ammunition
dumps which have been burgled
by somebody who must surely
have taken a four-ton blitz-
wagon to carry off his spoils.
There are no preparations to
deal with seditious strikes and
no policy on what is to happen
to the Communists and their
leaders if Russia makes war. It
has been announced by an even-
ing paper that the Security De-
partment is investigating Com-
munist activities, and the best
that can be said of that is that
a Security Department which
bruits its operations abroad is
not very secure. It can only be
hoped that the investigations
will be more effective than those
which sent the innocent Aus-
tralia First men to an intern-
ment camp on the evidence of
a single member of the Russian
Medical Aid Society and of the
Left Book Club.
The Communist party needs
little investigation. Its pam-
phlets and the speeches of its
leaders seem to be sufficient to
bring it within the ambit of the
Crimes Act, despite the fact that
its head, Mr. Sharkey, general*
secretary —who is senior to the
president, who stepped into that
position from the assistant-sec-
retaryship—is inclined to infer,
without positively saying so, that
a statement by a certain Com-
rade Burns in Brisbane that the
party would fight on the side of
Russia in the event of war be-
tween the Soviet and the Wes-
tern Powers is only Mr. Burns’s
opinion.
Section 30 of the Crimes Act
declares that it shall be an
offence punishable by imprison-
ment for a period of up to two
years—with deportation if a con-
victed person has not been born
in Australia —for advocating or
encouraging, by speech or writ-
ing, the overthrow of the Con-
stitution by revolution or sabo-
tage, the overthrow by force or
violence of the established gov-
ernment of the Commonwealth
or of any other civilised State or
organised government. The
leaders of the Communist party
have made countless speeches
which come within the reach of
this section.
In the “Tribune,” official
organ of the Communist Party
Central Committee (15/9/’4B),
appears a manifesto read to the
Central Committee of the party
by Mr. Sharkey. He gloats that
the “developments in Berlin have
demonstrated once more the
great strength of the Soviet
Union and its ability to defeat
the aggressive policy of the
Anglo-American imperialists”:
The struggle in Berlin has called
the bluff of the atom-bomb black-
mailers and would-be intimidators.
Imperialist spokesmen have been
compelled to admit that for them
Berlin represents an unqualified de-
feat. Reviewing Berlin events the
“S. M. Herald” was compelled to
admit that the Soviet Union is “im-
measurably the strongest military
Power in the world.”
And after boasting that Soviet
Air Force bombers and jet-
fighters were superior in quantity
and quality to the air strength
“at the disposal of imperialism”
— i.e., of Britain and the United
States —he rejoices that the
Commonwealth which gave him
birth has “had to admit defeat
and journey to Moscow for
negotiation,”
On top of which, after quot-
ing Mr. Chifley, with approval,
as having said that Russia did
not want war, he adds that
“there can be no doubt of the
peace-loving policy pursued by
the Soviet Union,” but asks:
Does Mr. Chifley expect the Soviei
Government to forgo the interests of
the Soviet people to appease the
aggressive, warmongering imperialists,
to forgo their national interests in
favor of American imperialism?....
This may suit the rotten, corrupt
policies of the politicians of France,
Italy and even Great Britain, but it
does not suit the interests of the
Soviet Union or of world peace
The rickety capitalist economies are
facing further grievous catastrophes
while the planned economy of the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
rises majestically.
Sharkey said that the Chifley
Government “appears to accept
it as axiomatic that if the Anglo-
American imperialists do at-
tempt their suicidal war against
the Soviet Union, Australia will
automatically join the camp of
the warmongers.” On which he
comments that “a cardinal fea-
ture of the policy of the Aus-
tralian Communist party is that
it must not give up its indepen-
dence to Wall-street, and that
this country must not go to war
at the behest of Yankee billion-
aires and hysterical militarists.”
These are the same “billion-
aires” and “militarists” whom
Mr, Sharkey a few years ago
was addressing as “democrats”
and begging to rush to the aid of
Russia,
He declared to the C.P. Cen-
tral Committee that “American
imperialism, like Hitler imperial-
ism, was prepared to shed oceans
of blood and drag the world
through unspeakable horrors to
achieve its aim of world domi-
nation.”
He said:
This was the character of the
enemy against whom we had to
arouse the people to preserve Aus-
tralia’s independence and security.
And if this sally doesn’t
bring the ruffian within the
ambit of the Crimes Act, his
references to Malaya should.
He spoke on a day when an
innocent Australian, a miner
with a wife and two children,
going about his lawful occasions,
was set upon by Communist
terrorists and shot and mutilated
in a manner which made him
unrecognisable.
Yet Mr. Sharkey says:
In Malaya, direct armed struggle
with the forces of British imperialism
was proceeding on a large scale ; in
Burma most of the country had

DEATH IS SO PERM .._
Issjnd by The Australian Road Safety Council
RS 12J3.88
HE was young and healthy. He had a new,
powerful motorcycle and a pretty girl on the
pillion. He felt it was good to be alive.
That is why he is dead now. He felt so good
that he rode carelessly... foolishly... showily. Just
once too often he failed to give right of way to other
traffic. He and the girl were killed instantly.
Your motorcycle is fast, powerful—and can be
dangerous. With its high acceleration it makes cutting
in and out of traffic so easy, and—so risky. Don’t
let the craze to get there faster ride YOU out of this
world .... Be careful . . . BRAKE it down.
already been liberated from the Thakin
Nu Government, which revealed it-
self as a Government not of national
independence but of collaboration
and subservience to British im-
perialism—The demand by the
forces of reaction that Australian
forces be sent to Malaya was a de-
mand for Australia to become openly
an imperialist colonial Power, using
its armed forces to protect the in-
vestment of its capitalists in the
orthodox and bloody imperialist
fashion We must continue to
extend our campaign in defence of
the Malayan independence move-
ment and, in the event of British
imperialist intervention in Burma,
also do everything to extend all pos-
sible fraternal assistance to the
Burmese people.
British troops are being used
in force to quell rebellion in
Malaya and to protect Australian
citizens from Mr. Sharkey’s
murderous Chinese friends. Mr.
Sharkey is on the side of the
enemy. He has every facility
given him by the Commonwealth
Government to carry on his
“campaign in defence” of the
murderers of Australians and
against the United States, which
he describes as an “enemy.”
Some of his Central Committee,
members of which listened
respectfully to the statement and
applauded it, are actually part
of the industrial government of
this country, sitting on statutory
bodies such as the Stevedoring
Commission and drawing Gov-
ernment emoluments.
The position is a challenge
which Mr. Chifley can scarcely
avoid. The country needs to be
told what he is going to do.
If he does not do anything, the
country can make its own guess
as to where it stands.
Murder.
The murder of Count Berna-
dette, a man who had given
great service to humanity,
thrilled the world with horror.
He was a man of peace, a citi-
zen of a nation which had been
neutral in both great wars, an
emissary accepted by all sides
in World War II and able to
travel as safely through bar-
barous Germany as through
peaceful England.
He was chosen as mediator in
Palestine because he was
generally trusted and because
his chairmanship in long stand-
ing of the Red Cross gave him
a position all his own.
Yet he was murdered in cold
blood by men in Israeli uni-
form in Israeli territory while
on a mission of peace.
The Israeli Government can-
not escape responsibility, what-
ever its protestations. It may
have been the Stern gang or the
Irgun Zvai Leumi which com-
mitted the savagery—though the
latter body denies it. But it is
the Israeli Government that
has tolerated those murder
organisations in its midst, and
which, though it deprecated their
crimes against British soldiers,
as horrible in some respects as
that now imputed to some of
its uniformed agents, has never
taken any real steps to suppress
terrorism.
At the very moment of the
brutal murder of Count Berna-
dette and his French assistant,
Colonel Serot, the Freedom
Radio of Irgun Zvai Leumi was
broadcasting from Tel Aviv, the
Jewish capital.
The swiftness with which
warrants were issued by the
Israeli Government for the
arrest of, specific terrorists
showed that it was all along
aware of their whereabouts, as
it must have been of their opera-
tions. And the statement of
Colonel Bunche, who has taken
over temporarily the work of
the dead delegate, that the
prejudicial statements of Mr.
Mosche Shertok, the Israeli
Prime Minister, about the super-
vision of the truce, were not of a
kind to discourage acts of
terrorism, will have general
agreement.
There is little hope of settle-
ment in Palestine, and happen-
ings there are another nail in
the coffin of that futile gossip-
sh<j£ji, to the chairmanship of
which Dr. Evatt aspires, in com-
mon with Dr. Arce, of Argen-
tine.
Everywhere it has attempted
to interfere to prevent strife
U.N.O. has produced conditions
worse than the original ones,
which at least have the advantage
of arising out of reasonably
clear-cut disputes fought out in
the open. U.N.O.’s operations
merely pave the way for the
creation of governmental
vacuums and for the develop-
ment of Communist under-
ground operations.
The “war” in Hyderabad was
scarcely a war. The Indian
troops met little or no resist-
ance save from a few gentry
who, in Wellington’s day, prob-
ably would have been termed
“looties.” The terms of peace
include another blow at U.N.O.
—the withdrawal of Hyderabad’s
case against India from the
jurisdiction of the Security
Council, the ban on Indian Con-
gress agitation to be withdrawn,
the Moslem irregular force of
Razakars to be disbanded, and
arrested Congress agitators to
be released. It is a triumph of
force for the Indians, but not
much of a contribution to the
peace of the Hindustan penin-
sula. It will certainly have its
effect on Pakistan-India rela-
tions. The day after the capitu-
lation of the Nizam —one of
whose most cherished official
titles is, or was, “Faithful Ally
of Britain”—Pakistan announced
a considerable augmentation of
its military forces. Whether
India or Russia is responsible
for this development remains to
be seen.

PERfONAL ITEUf
Still smiling at Father Time, Dick
Windeyer, K.C., 80 two weeks ago, blew
in with a breath of old Sydney. Wool-
clippers berthed two-deep at the Quay,
Cutty Sark among them, bullock-drays
rumbling down Macquarie-street and
their loads lowered over the cliff and run
across to the waiting ships, gum-trees in
King’s Cross and young Windeyer’s first
impression of Henry Parkes presiding
with dignity over the opening convention
of the Legislative Assembly with his leg
in plaster stretched on the table, before
him. ’• Windeyer’s great-grandfather was
Sydney’s first Mayor, and his father,
a first graduate of Sydney Uni. when
it stood on the site of the present Gram-
mar School in College-street, became
Parkes’s Attorney-General. He himself
was an Acting Chief Justice of N.S.W.
Supreme Court. One son is a professor
of radiology at London Uni., another
sank a U-boat in the Atlantic with hisi
Canadian corvette, and the eldest was
killed at Passchendaele. Still very much
on deck, Windeyer is interested in Food
for Britain (in which he was a prime
mover), the theatre, opening Balmain
coalmine and closing, before it opens, the
pub which booze interests are trying to
foist on his suburb, Lindfield.
Back in Australia after 20 years, Wes-
tralian F. J. Schonell, Professor of Edu-
cation at Birmingham Uni, An alert,
youngish man, son of a schoolmaster,
with Britain’s post-war progress in teach-
ing at his fingertips, Schonell is lectur-
ing in capital cities on what the Old
Country has to offer our education ex-
perts. Out of school he swims and
gardens.
Retired R.A.N. officers have clewed up
in some strange spots, but it is doubtful
if any have served in the Royal Indian
Navy. Lieut.-Cdr. C. G. Little, D.S.C.,
R.A.N., is certainly the first to command
a ship in the Pakistan Navy. The new
country wants new ports opened, and
applied for an experienced survey officer.
Little, due to retire from the R.A.N. after
23 years plotting seabeds, took the job.
His command will probably be a frigate,
converted, with fitting of additional echo-
sounders and a plotting-room, to survey-
ing duties. The Australian Hydrographic
branch hopes to supplant Admiralty
charts of local and New Guinea waters
with Australian maps: this work is well
advanced, and Little, commanding frigate
Lachlan during and after the war, was
responsible for a large share of it. He
has met all sorts of marine conditions,
but the nastiest stretch of water he knows
is the entrance to King’s Sound. Here
a swiftly-running tide funnels into whirl-
pools 300 yards across, one periphery of
which spins one way at seven knots, with
the other side swirling at four knots in
the opposite direction, both edges slop-
ing to a maelstrom in the centre. Lachlan s
1000-odd tons needed full rudder to main-
tain her course. With an estimated 25
years’ surveying ahead of our Navy, and
survey ships laid up for lack of qualified
hydrographists, Lieut.-Cdr. Little, brown-
faced, well-knit and not much over 45,
seems too good a man to lose to another
country.
“Trinco”: When Mackenzie King resigns as
Canada’s P.M. this year he will have beaten
Robert Walpole to the record for longest tenure
of office for an Empire P.M. by a few months.
Since December, 1921, with exception of two
periods in Opposition, he had been continually
in office, his service rating a message from
Churchill declaring that “in the whole history
of free Parliamentary institutions few, if any,
can claim to have led a party of State so long
and so pre-eminently.” His outstanding
characteristic has been ability to reconcile
contrary elements, and in a country where the
gap Between French and English was always
a problem, this facility was of emphatic
importance. Proof of its success is given
by national unity during the last war,
when, in addition to a complete Canadian army
serving overseas, backed by solid contribution
to Britain’s Air Force and Navy, Canada rated
fourth amongst the Allies in output of food,
munitions and supplies. Mackenzie King’s Em-
pire outlook is as sound; when, under the
Statute of Westminster, Canada became entitled
to send her own representatives abroad, he
said that “The symbol of British unity is to be
found in the British Crown.” Mackenzie King
is being succeeded by Louis Stephen St. Laurent,
new French-Canadian leader of the Liberal
party.
The platypus isn’t our only rare
mammal. Dr. David Johnson, associate
curator of mammals at the U.S, National
Museum, is searching round a crumbling
defence-post near Port Essington (N.T.)
for one of the world’s rarest mammals —
the. white-gloved rat. Over a century ago
one rat was found there by John Gilbert,
a member of Leichhardt’s expedition.
Now in the London Museum, that speci-
men is the only one ever found.
Back from the United Kingdom, where
he has been o.c, at Overseas H.Q., Air-
Commodore U. E. Ewart is a Duntroon
graduate who spent a couple of years on
the Staff Corps before joining the
R.A.A.F. in 1923. After two years on
exchange duty with the British 16th Army
Co-op. Squadron, he attended the staff
college at Andover, going on to liaison-
officer at Australia House. Soon after
fighting started he was appointed
Assistant-Chief-of-Staff to the Allied Air
Force. When the R.A.A.F. staff school
was opened in 1943 he became second
dickey, and in 1945 was given command
of Pacific Echelon. “Ulex” to his service-
mates, he has always been known for
quiet, solid efficiency, which possibly
accounts for the fact that he is gongless,
a rather rare thing for a brasshat.
Fifty-two years ago George Coates
and Dora Meeson were student artists
at Melbourne National Gallery. Coates
won the travelling scholarship for the
year and Miss Meeson was runner-up.
They both went to Paris to study at the
Academic Julian, and they married.
Coates, who was an official Australian
war artist in the first scrap, died in 1930,
but his wife is still painting. Her work
hangs in most Victorian galleries, and she
held a post-war exhibition recently at the
galleries of the Royal Water Color Society
in London. One of her pictures—of; the
blitzed Church of St. Clement Danes,
opposite Australia House entrance —has
been bought for Hobart Art Gallery.
The Reverend Doctor George Mac-
Leod, seen here as Dubois sees him, hides
behind his blue eyes a mischievous wit
and a mind like a razor. By invitation
from the Victorian Presbyterian Church,
he is lecturing in Australia on the work
of his lona mission. The mission’s object
is summed up by its embryo ministers’
curriculum —half the day they study
church matters, and the other half labor
with stone masons rebuilding the famous
11th-century Benedictine Abbey, de-
stroyed jn the Refbrmation. “Not,”
says the man from lona, “to rebuild a
romantic old pile of stones, but to get in
among the men we’re supposed to bene-
fit.” The lona Community now has its
roots in most English-speaking countries.
Grandson of Norman MacLeod, and
fourth baronet, young MacLeod won
CLERIC.
M.C. and Croix de Guerre with the Sea-
forths in the first scrap. A practical
Christian, he crossed to America to study
social conditions and ended up running a
mission in a British Columbia lumber
camp. Asked how Scotland is bearing up,
the Doctor answered with a story. A
“spiv” outside Glasgow Labor Exchange
was urging a young fellow to join the
Unemployed Trades Union. “What ad-
vantage would that give me?” inquired
the prospective member. “Why,” said
the spiv, “if you go in and get a job we’ll
fight your case.” “So,” smiled the
Doctor, “Glasgow is as it was.”
Four racing men;
In the past week or so have died four men
who, each in his own sphere, represented the
best there is in racing.
At Randwick races recently jockeys wore
black armbands in respect for trainer Bayly
Payten, passed on at 52. Payten was a model
trainer —a man thoroughly conversant with every
side of the game. Bayly took over in 1920 the
large training establishment built up by his
father Tom, and, since then, with the patronage
of Colin Stephen, Samuel Hordern, Pat Osborne
and other A.J.C. committeemen, has handled a
host of good horses; he headed the leading
trainers’ list in six out of the past seven years.
Scottish-born, and 69 when he died at Coota-
mundra (N.S.W.), George Main represented the
executive side of the turf. He made an early
acquaintance with horses in the 2nd Australian
Commonwealth Horse in the South African
dust-up, was elected to the A.J.C. Committee
in 1920 and was chairman from 1936 till ill-
health forced his resignation in 1945.
His job the administering of the executive’s
law, Harold Kelaher was an A.J.C. stipendiary
steward, to which position he was appointed
in 1940 after many years’ experience up Tam-
worth way as handicapper and steward with
the North and North-western Districts Racing
Association.
Completing this cross-section of racing,
Walter Digby was a prominent owner. His
colors were most recently carried by Clipper,
and most successfully by L’Aiglon, who won
the 1938 Sydney Cup.
Nobody can bring better standards to
bear on cattle than J. L. Wilson, whose
range-carved features are here revealed
by Chester. President of the Royal
National Agricultural Association of
Queensland and chairman of the Cattle
CATTLEMAN.
Breeders and United Graziers’ Executive,
he was born at Milson’s Point, Sydney.
Outbreak of the S’African war found him
in a recruiting office, and when that
business was finished he took up Calliope
station near Gladstone (Q.) in 1905 and
reared huge herds of beef. Now the son
runs Calliope while Wilson relaxes on
the Darling Downs. Presidency of the
R.N.A. sits lightly on the big fellow—
he.has a keen sense of humor and has
taken unto his character some of the
calm of the great open spaces.
Maoriland’s High Commissioner in
London since 1936, W. J. Jordan is doing
a further term at the job. Big Bill swung
the heavy realistic hoof of a metropoli-
tan policeman before migrating to M.L.
in 1904, where he successfully planted
his feet. Born in Kent 69 years ago and
educated at St. Luke’s Parochial School,
London, he farmed till the blast of
war blew him overseas with- the First
N.Z.E.F. and into a severe wound in
France. Following the armistice he was
an educational instructor; then made an
unsuccessful attack on Raglan seat
(Auckland) in 1919, followed by ousting
Sir Frederick Lang, the Speaker, in 1922.
Jordan was the first overseas man to be
admitted to the executive court of the City
of London Liverymen and Sheriffs,
whose privilege it is to elect the Lord
Mayor of London. His former mem-
bership of the Worshipful Company of
Girdlers entitled him to election.
Whether Big Bill’s duties impose the ob-
ligation of making girdle scones or ap-
pearing among Royalty in court dress
(to which as a Labor representative he
has no objection) they are carried out
with dignity and judgment.
Mcßeath caught Melbourne’s Royal-
visit Lud Mayor, James Stanley Disney,
as he was stepping into his car to return
home after his installation; and, despite
reminders from the commissionaire that
time was short, the new First Cit. held up
proceedings, removed his glasses and gave
COURTIER.
a five-minute “sitting” while the city
throng looked on. With the Royal visit
in view, Melbourne will have a Lud
Mayor worthy of the job, for Disney’s
war record is as colorful as it is honor-
able. A Gallip. veteran at 19, he later
transferred from the mud of Flanders to
the Royal Flying Corps, and with cobbers
Murray Jones, Harry Cobby, “King”
Cole and others flew SEs’s in No. 2
Fighter Squadron, Back home in 1919
he opened a small motor business which
now employs 70 people, won among other
solo and sidecar races the Phillip Island
200-mile TT, flew regularly with the Aero
Club and still holds his pilot’s licence.
He sat in the Legislative Council for six
years on the opposite side to his Dad, a
Labor stalwart who, until his death
recently, had been there for 33 years.
Lud Mayor Disney has been a City Father
for 13 years. Walt is no relation.
Frank E. Richardson, Geelong’s new
Mayor, is in the third generation of his
family to hold the office. His father, H.
F. Richardson, M.L.C., elected in 1894,
was the city’s first Australian-born Mayor.
His grandfather, John Richardson, was
a councillor fill 1857, and his grand-
father, on the distaff side, was Mayor in
1885. The present incumbent is head of
one of the oldest auctioneering firms in
Victoria and is president of the Pivot’s
Art Gallery Association.
Into the silence;
In Sydney, at 71, Charles Robert Anderson,
widely-known grazier. He owned property in
the Riverina, was a civil engineer and surveyor
with the Vic. Roads and Water Supply Com-
mission, then bought the 80,000-acre Leichhardt
station near Aramac (W.Q.) and controlled it
to the end.
At 75, in Melbourne, William John Lock,
one of the pioneers of the city’s taxis. After
running a horse-drawn-cab business, begun
in 1900, he bought his first petrol wagon in
1916, and ended with a fleet of Silver Top
taxis. Before the police and Customs had their
own cars he provided their transport, and up
to 1940 had the contract for carrying prisoners
from Pentridge for deportation.
In Melbourne, Dr, John Sydney Green,
obstetrician and gynaecologist. He was vice-
president of the Victorian branch of the
8.M.A., and was senior gynaecologist at the
Women’s Hospital.
In Adelaide, at 79, John Eaton, former chief
engineer of the State’s Engineering and Water
Supply Department, and member of the River
Murray Commission for 27 years. He joined
the Water Conservation Department in 1884,
and was associated with the locking of the
Murray, construction of the barrages at its
mouth and most of S.A.’s reservoirs.
In Hobart, at 75, Frederick John Batt, until
his resignation last year State Auditor-General.
Joining the Public Service in 1890, he served in
almost every position in the Audit Department,
becoming Auditor-General in 1937. His 57
years in the one department is probably a record
for Australia.
In Wellington (M.L.), at 75, Adam King
Jowitt, first-cousin of Lord Jowitt, Britain’s
Lord Chancellor. In 1898 he joined a party of
Maorilanders headed for the Klondyke, travel-
ling by sled from Skagway through White Horse
Pass and Rapids and down the Yukon to Daw-
son City, where he spent eight years mining.
The passage through White Horse Rapids was
made by a boat built by the party themselves.

From Sydney
Sydney will wear a gardenia in her
hair this afternoon. At three o’clock the
Governor, Lieut.-General John Northcott,
will open the Red Cross flower festival
in the Domain.
Minister for Health Kelly did the right
thing by the Anti-Tuberculosis Associa-
tion and turned up at the annual meeting
last Thursday. This was in the very
handsome Assembly Hall of B.M.A.
House, and every seat was taken. It was
noteworthy that the company listened
carefully to every word uttered by the
speakers, and there can be no doubt that
the Government’s campaign against.this
dread disease has general approval.
Therefore, the work done during the past
35 years by the Anti-T.B. Association
should evoke deep gratitude.
Music in the afternoon always
makes appeal. At half-past-two next
Tuesday the small concert hall at History
House will encircle a programme of
music given by singers Heather Kinnaird,
Elsie Findlay and pianist Josephine Bell,
who will play some of her own compo-
sitions. Later there will be a tea-drinking
in the pleasant clubrooms upstairs. The
Crown-street Women’s Hospital is the
beneficiary. Mrs. Harold Bott is the
organiser, Mrs. W- A. Dovey the presi-
dent.
The Marcel Dekyveres, just back from
travels in Japan and China, are re-
counting the pleasures of the journey.
Japan, still very much under Army rule,
was not so enjoyable as Shanghai and
Hong Kong. In Shanghai, though the
war was just around the corner, life still
has its bright interludes, and the clubs,
even though now they must close at 11,
are still gay meeting-places. And nylons
are no dearer than they are here.
Mrs. Dekyvere got into her stride on
her return in the matter of the Black-and-
White Ball, of which she is the president.
The Troc. is going to rock all right on
the night of October 5. Booking even
now is being rushed. There is a swag of
prizes to be won, including a woman’s
gold wristlet watch. This is a very special
wristlet. Other prizes are a model
dress from Elizabeth Arden, some
lovely hats, and a travelling beauty-
case replete with color and charm. Spec-
tacular event of the night will be the
Glow Worm Dance. No fewer than a
thousand tiny torches will scintillate for
its duration, while all other lights will
be dimmed. The McMaster lady, Mrs.
Eugene Goossens and Mrs, Bertie Kelly
will judge the frocks.
The Institute of Journalists, the Society
of Women Writers and the Ballet Club all
chose to spread lunches last Thursday.
The Institute’s was an annual affair, and
therefore more or less domestic. But the
Women Writers snared Mr, Gyde, of the
publishing firm of Heinemann. He was
accompanied by his wife, who is well-
known singer Sophie Wyss. Why do
writers adore a publisher? After all, pub-
lishers are the middlemen between the
creator and the consumer. It is they who
should dote on the writer. This Letter has
often wondered what was the start of
publishers. Was it when the psalmist
groaned “of the making of books there
is no end,” and thereupon a man came
forward and offered to suppress a lot of
them? His descendants are still doing it.
Anyway, a writer whom Heinemann
did not pass by was Henry Handel
Richardson. Mr. Gyde talked of this
brilliant Australian in such warm and
friendly manner that a picture of the
stately woman in the dark velvet frocks
softened with lace at throat and wrist was
printed on the listener’s mind. The tired
eyes beneath their heavy-hooded lids, her
consuming passion for writing, her de-
votion to her husband, her friendship for
her publishing friends, in spite of the fact
that on the first day she visited them
they gave her all the wrong sandwiches
for tea —these lived again in their warm
devotion to her memory. Really, Mr.
Gyde made publishers sound quite

Florence Taylor was the speaker at the
Ballet Club last Thursday. She spoke on
her many travels, and in particular on
one journey to Dunk Island. Mrs. Taylor
is an observant traveller, and in her talk
she pointed out the many things lacking
in our accommodation for the tourist on
the journey north. This she did in no
captious spirit, but simply to stress the
necessity for improvement if we would
lure overseas money to our beauty-spiots.
But Mrs. Taylor had no complaints about
the butterflies and the doves on Dunk
Island —they were at their gorgeous best
for her.
Overheard: “She seems to have
changed. She arrived yesterday wearing
a new suit, a spring hat and that Can-
berra Look!”
Lorraine Halse Rogers, whose father
was knight Percival Halse Rogers, be-
came the wife of Dr. Robert Vines, in
St. Mark’s at Darling Point, last week,
Lorraine, who is a fully-fledged physio-
therapist, wore white lace, satin and tulle
and the prettiest smile. The ’groom is the
elder son of Padre E. H. Vines and Mrs.
Vines, of Turramurra. Bride’s mother,
Lady Halse Rogers, held reception at the
Royal Sydney Golf Club after the cere-
mony.
Contralto Essie Ackland, back in her
own country with the laurels plucked
overseas still green, finished her inter-
state tour under A.B.C. direction with a
matinee in Sydney Town Hall last Satur-
day, and a recital at Wollongong last
night. Essie, with assisting artists Carmel
Hakendorf, talented violinist from Ade-
laide, and equally talented pianist Geof-
frey Parsons, gave a series of concerts
in the northern coalfields. These were
arranged in conjunction with the Joint
Coal Board. Next they went north to
Brisbane, Toowoomba, Lismore, Mur-
willumbah, Broken Hill, Adelaide, Mount
Gambier, Kalgoorlie were among many
cities and towns which heard their music.

The Independent Theatre Ball is the
big date for tonight. The ballroom of
the Wentworth is practically booked out.
The Actors’ Benevolent Fund gets the
swag. Evie Hayes and her mother and
Webb Tilton will be in Doris Fitton’s
party. Norman Lawrence, from the
Tivoli, will sing; and the Independents’
own Diana Perryman will croon. Mr.
and Mrs. Carl Randall and her mother
and Leo Packer will add their scintillation
to the night.
On Saturday afternoon at three o’clock
the 69th yearly exhibition of the Royal
Art Society will be opened in the Educa-
tion Galleries by F. D. Clewlow. On Wed-
nesday, September 29, the Women’s
Auxiliary of the Society is bidding friends
to a cocktail party in the galleries. This
will also help the Kindergarten Union.
And on Wednesday, October 6, the presi-
dent and council are giving an At Home
at the same address right in the midst of
their own pictures. This will be an even-
ing affair.
You won’t forget England in your
Christmas presents, will you? If you
make out your hamper orders now over-
seas friends will receive them in good
time for the festival .that was once so
gay with them. They still need our help.
Here are a few lines taken from last
week’s airmail:
The most lovely parcel of all has just
arrived, full of currants and sultanas and
almonds. Nothing could have been lovelier.
Dried fruits are really impossible to get
here and the children love fruit-cake and
puddings. We shall be baking a real fruit-
cake this evening.
It was quite a thrill to see all the wonder-
ful tins emerge from your parcel. How
could you know that local butchers were
displaying a huge poster: “Your meat ration
[for a week] lOd. worth Carcass meat, 2d.
Corned Beef.”
The contents of the parcel are wonderful.
Every tin comprises a dinner.
In the family of the last writer there are
four people. So that gives an idea of
the meagre rations the English family is
managing on. Now, please don’t listen
to the “It’s not really so bad over there”
spoken by the selfish here. No, it isn’t
had. It’s worse!
Film-fans who remember the personnel
of the company which passed through
Sydney on its way to Fiji to play in “The
Blue Lagoon” will be interested to hear
of actor Donald Houston’s engagement.
The girl of his heart is 19-year-old
Brenda Hogan. They met last year when
both were acting in the stage production
of “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.” Brenda
has acted a good deal in repertory in the
north of England.
w
cinths in her hair to match her bouquet,
was her sister’s bridesmaid. Elizabeth
and Diana Lewis, nieces of the bride,
were the flower-girls; they wore blue-
organdie frocks and carried white baskets
of hyacinths. The bridegroom, Michael
Alastair, who is the younger son of Mr.
and Mrs. W. L. Russell Clarke, of South
Yarra, had his cousin, Sir Rupert Clarke,
as best man. The Rt, Rev. J. D, Mc-
Kie, Bishop of Geelong, blessed the vows.
Mr. and Mrs, Essington Lewis enter-
tained at a reception in the garden of
their home. The pink-lined marquee
was centred with a flower-decorated sup-
port and three tall shrubs decked with
masses of carnations and daffodils formed
another decorative note. 'Mrs. Essington
Lewis wore a jacket-suit of marine-blue,
and her hat of matching coarse straw
had a cluster of pink roses set at the
front. Mrs. Russell Clarke combined a
lavender-blue crepe frock and a pastel-
pink straw hat which carried matching
flowers. Lady Herring’s aqua-blue crepe
frock was worn under a navy coat; her
wide-brimmed hat was of navy straw.
Lady Clarke’s burgundy-lace frock was
worn with a silver-fox cape and a hat to
match her frock. Red, navy and white
stripes outlined the revers of Mrs.
Damien Miller’s frock; her wide-
brimmed navy hat was swathed with navy
tulle and tied under the chin. A black
velvet snood and black Persian-lamb coat
made effective alliance for Mrs. lan
Miller. Mrs. Ross Grey Smith’s black-
straw hat featured a large blue ostrich
feather and was worn with a black
tailored coat. Mrs. Jim Campbell’s en-
semble was of light navy; her matching
swathed velvet beret was worn off the
face. Lady Currie also was in navy;
flowers trimmed her wide-brimmed straw
hat. Mrs. R. G. Casey wore a dyed-
ermine coat over her black frock ; her
small hat was of black velvet.
November 9 is the date fixed for the
Victoria League Ball, which will be held
in St. Kilda Town Hall and will be under
the patronage of the Governor, Sir
Winston Dugan. Lady Knox is chair-
man of the ball committee. Mrs. lan
Connell is hon. secretary and Mrs. H. D.
Giddy hon. treasurer. Mesdames Guy
Bakewell, Rupert Greene and Cairns
Officer are the vice-presidents. In charge
of ticket-selling are Mrs. Eric Ross,
Margaret Fraser and Anne Bailey.
Kathleen Lascelles, whose Gloucester
Auxiliary Ball is always so successful,
has put her good offices at the committee’s
disposal. Money from the ball will go
to the league’s bush libraries and also for
their Food-for-Britain effort.
Mrs. Garnet Carroll presided over a
meeting called to arrange details of a
Fashion Fantasy which will be held at
the Princess Theatre on the afternoon of
October 19, all proceeds of which go to
U.N.O. Mrs. Carroll’s hat was pastel-
blue felt with matching ostrich-feather
plumes; over her black frock she wore
a mink-trimmed, black- Persian-lamb coat.
Peter Gray, leading man in “Present
Laughter,” will compere the show, and
Daphne Newton, also of the cast,, will
describe the fashions. In charge of the
fashion selection is Mrs. Phillip Dare,
while Betty Coldham and Sunday Wen-
man are ticket-secretaries. Fashions will
not take up all the afternoon. Sally
Gilmour, Margaret Scott and Walter
Gore will, with the permission of
Madame Rambert, tread a measure or
two. Mesdames George Griffiths,
Bernard Heinze and Peggy Fraser will
look after the programme-sellers, and
Mrs. Charles Wenman and a capable
committee have charge of a raffle, which
should be popular: a fur-coat, a tailored
suit and an afternoon frock are just a
few of the gifts which have been donated
to the committee. A cocktail-bar will
be set up in the foyer, and when the show
is over drinks will be served. Geoff
Summers and Eileen Brennan will do the
honors.
When American Consul-General S. J.
Fletcher and his wife gave a late-after-
noon party at their South Yarra home for
U.S. Ambassador Myron M. Cowen, and
Mrs. Cowen, they invited almost 400
guests. The spacious reception-rooms
were decorated with bowls of spring
blossoms. Mrs. Fletcher greeted the
guests in a simply-cut black crepe after-
noon frock which had long, tight-fitting
sleeves and a corsage of pale-pink orchids.
Mrs. Cowen’s ballerina frock of tobacco-
brown taffetas featured three-quarter-
length sleeves; the deep square-cut neck-
line was highlighted with a gold-and-
diamond ornament and matched with ear-
rings. A brown jewelled snood was set
on the back of her hair. The Knox
lady’s formal dinner-gown was in
a cool leaf-green, and the Brookes
lady’s ankle-length dinner-dress of
midnight-blue and silver lace was
worn with a blue-fox cape. Mrs.
Eardley Wilmot wore a small berry-and-
flower-trimmpd hat with her smart black
cocktail frock. Black with silver-fox furs
made effective combination for Mrs.
Howard Bettle. Mrs. Harold Rabling’s
white and water-lily-green flower hat
made contrast to her black frock. Mrs.
Leigh Falkiner’s black frock and platina-
fox fur was topped with a large black
hat trimmed with black taffeta ribbon
bows.
Mrs. Sidney Baillieu Myer’s large grey
hat with trimming of grey and black
ostrich feathers was worn with a black
frock and platina-fox stole. The Consul
for the Netherlands, Col. F, H. Wright,
was accompanied by his wife, in a bustle
frock of black crepe and a black hat.
Madame Faure, in navy-and-white-printed
jacket-suit and white hat, was with her
husband, the French Military Attache,
Col. M. P. Faure, With General Sir
Iven Mackay was Lady Mackay, who
chose a soft-blue ensemble. The quaint
Mary Queen of Scots bonnet worn by
Mrs. Hester, wife of the U.S. Military
Attache, Brig.-General H. B. Hester, was
greatly admired. It was fashioned of
black velvet, and the halo brim was sewn
with tiny pearls. Mrs. Hester wore it with
a smart black suit. Other Americans
present included Mrs. J. Poore, wearing
black and a three-quarter-length black
Persian-lamb coat; Mrs. V. Zirkle, who
combined striped taffetas and black taste-
fully, and Mrs. H. B. Leggett in beech-
brown taffetas.

Oldest and largest variety-chain or-
ganisation in the Commonwealth, the co.
operates about 90 stores,scattered through-
out all States. Its £1,441,515 of capital is
in 150,000 A 8 p.c. cum. prefs. and
1,291,515 ords., all f.-p. to £1 each. Popu-
larity of the scrip rests upon prospects of
a new share issue at an early date, and
upon high earning-capacity—in bad as
well as good times —combined with a
sound financial structure and a reputa-
tion for competence and fair dealing.
The board has again asked for per-
mission to make a new share issue to help
finance its big building and trade-expan-
sion programme. The amount, nature
and terms of the issue are to be an-
nounced when approval has been received
from the Capital Issues Control Board,
which, for unstated reasons, turned down
a similar request from the co. a couple
of years back. For this and other reasons
the price of the ords, has followed a zig-
zag course in the market. During 1947
the range was between 795. and 955.; the
figure had dropped to 765. 6d. during the
first half of 1948, but strengthened from
June on, and stood at 85s. last week-end.
Immediate return at 85s. is 3.5 p.c. on a
15 p.c. div. basis. A one-for-four new
issue at a premium of, say, 100 p.c. would
reduce the net price to 765. 6d. (includ-
ing brokerage), giving a return of a shade
under 4 p.c. on the basis of a 15 p.c. dis-
tribution, which would then call for
£242,159, and that was more than covered
by last term’s available profit.
Expanding turnover (sales increased by
IPi p.c.) more than offset the persistent
rise in costs (mainly on account of wage
lifts), and net earnings increased by
£60,909, reaching £288,180. That was
after allowing something for taxation,
£113,015 (up £14,144) for depreciation of
fixed assets and £32,347 for the staff fund,
but includes £31,358 tossed into the free-
hold-depreciation reserve (now £361,534)
without comment. Abolition of War-
time (Co.) Tax helped the net figure along,
too. The £288,180 covered pref. require-
ments and 21.3 p.c. on ord. capital as
against 16.6, 16.7, 14.3 and 12.5 p.c. for
the four preceding years, and 24.4 p.c. in
1939. The div. was lifted from 12 p.c. to
15 p.c., making the average 11.5 p.c. for
the last seven years, compared with an
average of 18 p.c. for the five years before
that.
During the year Kirk’s Bazaar (Mel-
bourne) and a site behind the Perth
(W.A.) branch were bought. This was
mainly responsible for the growth of
£95,795 in freeholds and of £18,347 in
mortgages:

On leaseholds and fittings, etc., £47,329
more was written off than was spent. To
carry an extra £167,799 of stocks —the
increase partly reflects rising prices—and
clip £54,596 off the overdraft the co. drew
upon cash, etc., for £98,667, reduced
debtors’ balances by £27,069 and leant
upon trade creditors for an extra £23,104.
The more-or-less liquid surplus (£536,661)
was £25,220 stronger.
With costs still climbing and margins
on controlled lines becoming narrower,
profit is now largely a function of turn-
over, which has continued to increase
since the close of accounts. In the long
run, however, costs are likely to prove the
most stubborn member of the team. Still,
there is nothing at the moment to suggest
that the 15 p.c. is likely to be interfered
with. Introduction of fresh capital will
be followed by the opening of new stores
in all States —sites have been secured —
and reconstruction and remodelling of
some old ones.

This big holding co., which has a capital
of £873,874 in f.-p, 14s. shares, keeps the
curtain drawn over the figures of its
principal offshoots. However, mindful
of the history of the business, the market
regards it as a steady 9 p.c, proposition,
with prospects, and prices the scrip at
395. 6d., giving a return of 3.2 p.c. on a
9 p.c. div. basis. The investor at 395.
6d, who looks for approximately 4 p.c.
on his money is prepared to wait for a
lift in the div. to 11 p.c., or other benefits.
Here is the board’s policy as acting-
chairman J. A. Carpenter puts it:
Whilst your directors are impressed with
the satisfactory results hitherto obtained,
they are not unmindful of the uncertainties
of the future, and, consequently, consider it
expedient to consolidate and expand the
co.’s activities in a manner best calculated
to maintain internal strength and enable the
payment of a constant rate of dividend;
hence the programme of further capital
expenditure... .m connection with Peters
Creameries Pty., Ltd., Foley Bros. Pty.,
Ltd., and the new refrigeration co.
Last term’s £96,898 of profit (up
£10,307) was 11 p.c, on capital. The
improvement appears to have come partly
from the interest acquired in' the old-
established dairy-produce business of Foley
Bros. (Sydney) during the previous term.

The extra £19,746 of capital gathered
last term was the final 2s. 4d. on 169,247
contribs. This money and more besides
was held in cash (up £46,640) when the
books closed.
Backbone of the group is Peters Ice
Cream Pty. (Sydney), which took over
the parent’s ice-cream business in 1939
and made a one-for-one bonus-scrip issue
in the following year, lifting its paid
capital to £1,000,000, all held by the
parent. Expanding turnover and savings
following modernisation and extension
of plant and abolition of War-time (Co.)
Tax have “provided an offset against
ever-increasing costs of production.”
Sales continue at a record level, and
more plant is being installed. But with-
drawal of the subsidy on milk products
and other increases in costs will “have a
marked influence upon future earnings,”
Peters Creamery Pty. (Taree, N.S.W.),
paid capital £150,000, is one of the lead-
ing milk condenseries in the Common-
wealth. Last term it met the whole of
the parent’s requirements, sent a lot of
whole milk to the Milk Board, and ex-
ported a considerable quantity of pro-
cessed milk. Further capital expenditure
on extension of activities of this co. and
of Foley Bros, is planned; but there is
no suggestion that those on the parent’s
register will be asked to assist.
Peters (S.A.) Pty., whose £25,000 of
capital has been put up by the parent,
has bought a property at Adelaide, and
has the plant ready, but is still unable to
commence trading because priorities in
building materials are holding up con-
struction.
Peters (Vic.), Peters (W.A.), Peters
Arctic (Q.) and Peters Arctic (N.Q.) are
four prosperous and financially well-
ribbed associates.

Caught between the nutcrackers of rising
costs and falling revenue the 1947 profit
figure was severely compressed, and re-
serves had to be drawn upon for £12,841
to pay the reduced div. The effect upon
visible accumulations, however, was more
than offset by transfer of £31,000 from
inner reserves, previously tucked away
under cover of sundry creditors. It was
evaporation of tourist traffic, following
completion of demobilisation of the ser-
vices, that was chiefly responsible for the
contraction in revenue. Since war began
the co. has issued 6,548,054 concession
tickets) (4d. single journey) to members
of the forces, takings reaching their peak
in 1946.
With the advent of the 40-hour week,
and further lifts in wages and other
operating and maintenance costs, it was
obvious that the business couldn’t con-
tinue to operate at a profit unless fares
were increased. This was done, with the
sanction of the Prices Commissioner,
early last term. And, after allowing
unspecified amounts for depreciation and
taxation, the management was able to
write the profit figure at £20,113, or 6.7
p.c. on capital as against 1.7, 8, 9.1, 9.8,
7, 6.6, 8.1, 8.2, 8.2 and 11 p.c. back to
1938. On shareholders’ funds (capital and
reserves combined) the year’s net result
was only 4.7 p.c. A profit of £11,115 on
sale of shares in other cos. was sent direct
to reserves. , The div., which dropped
from 8 p.c. to 6 p.c. in the previous term,
was: lowered to 5 p.c., and it is doubtful
whether better need be expected under
existing conditions.
Costs are still on the up-grade, which
makes improvement in the net return
from the chief earning asset —Sydney-
Manly ferry service—doubtful during the
current term. Much will depend upon
what the co.’s three stores —at Palm
Beach, Newport and Newport Beach —its
Narrabeen-Newport iceworks and its
small Pittwater ferry services turn in.
Meanwhile a second one of the Sydney-
Manly ferries is to be converted to diesel-
electric propulsion, and is expected to be
out of commission until July, 1949. Of
the other five ferries in this service, only
one is entirely a coal-burner; the others
use oil or coal.
The co., which has an able and alert
management, is still providing one of the
cheapest and most efficient transport
services in the Sydney metropolitan area,
and there is nothing to worry about in the
finances; .

Released from the incubus of War-
time (Co.) Tax—which had lain very
heavily on this efficient wholesaler of
motor spares and accessories—the board
has decided to strengthen finances rather
than lift the div. The £21,051 rise in
earnings partly results from improved
turnover as well as tax relief. To an in-
creasing extent, Brooklands’ progress
and expansion are bound up with the de-
velopment of locally-manufactured lines:
the co. has wholesale distributing rights
for G. Motors-Holden spares, Olympic
tyres and K.L.G. spark-plugs (now made
under licence by A.W.A.). Most local
items came forward in better quantity
last term, as also did imported lines, of
which Lucas electrical equipment is
amongst the co.’s oldest and most valued
agencies.
Brooklands Accessories originated 25
years ago as a subsidiary of the Mel-
bourne concern, Allied Motor Interests,
Ltd. (recently wound up), but the intro-
ductory profits table covers its full career
as a public co. An important step in 1946
was the setting-up of a Sydney branch by
purchasing the motor division of Gib-
son, Battle and Co. Pty.; this brought in
new agencies and gave Brooklands its
first freehold (at corner of Liverpool- and
Crown-streets).
Rapid growth of the Sydney branch has
contributed to the expanding scale of
business indicated by last term’s increases
in debtors (£29,454) and stocks (£57,068):

Leaseholds include the South Melbourne
headquarters and branches at Bendigo
and Horsham (Vic.). Since the close of
accounts finances have been eased by an
issue of 25,242 £1 ords. at a premium of
17s. 6d.; when paid the premiums will
lift reserves to £77,564 and capital will
be £119,967, including £25,000 in 7 p.c.
cumulative prefs.
Last year’s net profit represented 43.6
p.c. on ordinary capital after paying the
prefs., and was struck after depreciation
of £4361 (up £547) and tax provision of
£21,624 (down £4376). At £65,893,
general expenses were up £13,742, but
maintained a constant ratio of about 52
p.c. to gross profit (£125,724).
A full year’s div. on the increased ord.
capital at the present 12j p.c. rate, plus
pref. requirements, will call for £13,621, or
£20,835 less than was netted last term. But
earnings in the motor and ancillary trades
are very sensitive to fluctuations in eco-
nomic conditions.
At the current price of 495. 9d. the yield
is 5 p.c. on the basis of a 12$ p.c. div.
The ords. will have net tangible backing

Lady Claire Gold No. 1, N.L.
This is one of two prospecting
concerns being formed in Mel-
bourne to investigate adjoining
leases on the old Tanami field
(N.T.), over which an option is
held to Sept. 30, 1949, with
provision for a three-year exten-
sion. Lady Claire Gold No. 2,
N.L., is the other co. Its capi-
tal structure and issue of shares,
etc., are similar to that of No. 1
co. The directorates are inter-
locking, and a five-head battery
on the spot is to handle ore for
the pair.
No. 1 has a nominal capital
of £75,000 in 300,000 shares of
ss. each, of which 80,000 are
offered—l9,ooo to the public,
36.000 to shareholders in Lady
Claire Gold Underwriters and
25.000 to Dolly Gold Syndicate
—payable Is. each on application
and allotment and the balance as
required. In addition Dolly
Gold takes; 20,000 paids, plus
£4500 cash, and Lady Claire
Underwriters £l5OO cash. Pre-
liminary exes, are put at £5OO,
and cost of initial plant £lB5O,
That leaves £11,650 for pros-
pecting, etc., when the present
issue is fully subscribed and
paid. Of the 200,000 shares in
pickle, Dolly Gold is to get
50.000 paids, plus £12,000 cash,
if and when the options are
exercised.
Ken Harris and his wife,
Claire, who have been prospect-
ing in the Territory since 1934,
own the leases. They have given
an option to Dolly Gold Syndi-
cate, whose members are
L. R. D., J. R. and I. O. Stable.
Dolly Gold has transferred its
rights in respect of one group of
four leases, extending for about
3300 ft. along the line of lode, to
Lady Claire Gold Underwriters,
which is the vendor to the pre-
sent co. Members of the Under-
writers co. consist of all the
directors of the present co.—
knight William Angliss, H. S.
Foil, L. J. Hartnett, R. McKay,
L. R. D. Stable —and S. S.
Crick, H. L. Trout and Ken
Harris.
The field, about 420 miles
n,-w. of Alice Springs and 450
miles from Wyndham, has
attracted attention ever since
Alan Davidson discovered it in
1900. Transport, water and
other difficulties, including
heavy overhead, have stood in
the way of its development. In
the early 1930’s E. O. Watt, J.
Hebbard and F. B. Stephens
went out and confirmed the
optimism of H. Y. L. Brown,
Lionel Gee, Dr. Jensen and
others, and some well-known
London and Australian mining
interests began to nibble ; but
the financial situation made it
difficult to raise funds, and noth-
ing was done.
Shallow prospecting has dis-
closed an outcrop of schistose
formations' with quartz reefs
and stringers, carrying up to
2oz. and more per ton in places,
with large mullocky lode forma-
tions, carrying fine gold, east of
the reef zone. Whether the pre-
sent co. will find enough high-
grade stuff to warrant large-
scale operations with the price
of gold and costs as they are
remains to be seen. A regular
plane service and a good road
to Alice Springs have done much
to overcome transport difficul-
ties. As for water and timber,
there are enough on the spot
for prospecting requirements,
but large-scale operations would
involve heavy expenditure in
dam construction and cartage.
WESTERN MINING CORPORATION LIMITED
Extracts from the Address of the Chairman, Sir Walter
Massy-Greene, delivered at the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders of Western Mining Corporation Limited, held
at Melbourne on Thursday, 12th August, 1948.
After dealing with the operations of
the Company the Chairman said; —
Our shareholding in Central Norseman
Gold Corporation, N.L., at the end of
the financial year was 1,885,000 shares,
of which 1,300,000 were fully paid and
585,000 were paid to 3/- per share.
This parcel of 586,000 shares was
part of an issue of 720,000 contributing
shares made by Central Norseman Gold
Corp., N.L., to provide funds for a new
shaft which that Company is sinking.
Since the balance date a further call of
1/- per share has been made and paid
on these shares making them paid to
4/- per share and leaving 1/- per share
still subject to call.
Subsequent to the close of the financial
year Central Norseman Gold Corpora-
tion, N.L., made a further issue of 280,000
shares of which Western Mining Corpora-
tion Ltd. holds 227,500 on which 1/- per
share has been paid, leaving a balance of
4/- subject to call.
With the object of improving the posi-
tion of liquid resources of Western Mining
Corporation Ltd. a parcel of 800,000
Central Norseman shares were recently
disposed of at 10/- per share, less broker-
age of 4d. per share, giving a net realisa-
tion of £386,667. This amount will be
used to finance the payment of calls on con-
tributing shares held by the Corporation,
to reduce the existing loan from Gold
Exploration & Finance Co. of Aust Ltd.,
and to extend the Corporation’s operations.
Our holding in Central Norseman Gold
Corp., N.L., at date is:—
500.000 fully-paid shares of 5/- each,
585.000 contributing shares paid to
4/- each,
227,500 contributing shares paid to
1/- each,
a total of 1,312,500 shares, equal to 50.5
p.c. of the issued capital of that Com-
pany.
The 10/- shares of Western Mining Cor-
poration Ltd. were recently subdivided
into two shares of 5/- each.
You will have noted from the Directors’
Report that during the financial year the
Corporation formed a new operating Com-
pany called New Coolgardie Gold Mines,
N.L.
Our shareholding in this new Company
is:—•
310.000 fully-paid shares of 10/- each,
170.000 contributing shares paid to 6/-
each at date,
a total of 480,000 shares equal to 60 p.c.
of the present issued capital of the Com-
pany.
Particulars of the New Coolgardie Com-
pany have already been published in the
prospectus of that Company and amplified
in the Directors’ report.
Another item of importance to report
is the formation last month of another
operating company named Great Western
Consolidated, N.L. This Company was
formed to take over from Western
Mining Corporation Ltd. the areas held
in the Yilgam District of Western Aus-
tralia, with the object of amalgamating
a number of properties and working them
as one unit. The project is the largest
yet undertaken by this Corporation.
Western Mining Corporation Ltd. has'
subscribed for 558,000 contributing
shares of 5/- each on which the sum of
1/- was paid on application. A further
442,000 fully-paid shares will be allotted
to Western Mining Corporation Ltd. on
completion of the transfer of the leases to
the new company. The initial nominal
capital of Great Western Consolidated,
N.L., is £250,000 divided into 1,000,000
shares of 5/- each, and our Company will
hold the whole of the issued shares total-
ling 1,000,000.
The Capital raised by the contributing
shares will be utilised to exercise options
over some of the properties and to con-
tinue the prospecting and development
work previously carried out by Western
Mining Corp. Ltd.
Further finance will be required to
equip the property and bring it intp
production, and in due time this will
necessitate an increase in the authorised
capital of Great Western Consolidated and
and an issue of the shares created thereby,
in which shareholders in Western Mining
Corporation will be given the oppor-
tunity to participate.
Full details of the results of prospecting
and development to the end of the finan-
cial year on the Great Western proper-
ties are given in the statements attached
to the Annual Report. Shareholders are
referred for details to this report which
is too lengthy to be repeated.
Since the close of the financial year in
March last development and sampling at
Great Western properties have been in
progress. This work has been on a limited
scale due to difficulty of access to old
workings through small prospecting shafts
and has been in consequence mainly con-
fined to confirming the earlier estimates
based on diamond drilling.
I would also like to refer to the
advantages which, in opinion of your
Board, will result from bringing the
various deposits comprising the Great
Western project into one organisation.
In these deposits it must be recognised
that there will be breaks in the minerali-
sation, and these breaks add to the diffi-
culty of finding new oreshoots and so
maintaining reserves. By operating in a
group production can be maintained even
though output from individual mines may
cease temporarily during the development
of successive oreshoots. It is believed that
this method of operation, by permitting
much more prospecting, will result in a
great increase in the total ore eventually
mined in the district. This is the primary
advantage to be expected from the amalga-
mation, but additional • advantages will
also result in lower cost of equipment
and of operating, the latter also having
the effect of adding to ore reserves by
bringing into reserves ore which otherwise
would be unpayable.
A beginning has also been made in
the geophysical surveys of the Salt
Lakes project to the south-east of Kal-
goorlie, where the Corporation holds three
prospecting reserves of 100 square miles
each. This work is in its very early
stages, but an anomaly has already been
indicated, and drilling will be begun
later in the year.
Apart from the routine examination of
prospects submitted to the Corporation no
other prospecting has been done since the
end of the year.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Mixed Pictures.
There are one or two surprises
at a mixed exhibition at Sydney
Grosvenor Galleries; a little oil
landscape, “Shadows,” by S.
Woodward Smith, much richer
and more faithful in observation
than his usual work ; a bare hill
by Leonard Long in which the
earth has something of the force
of a Lance Solomon and the
pines along the skyline some-
thing of the delicacy of a Percy
Lindsay ; a minute “Old Farm,”
with a very effective contrast
between green grass and dark
buildings, by Harley Griffiths,
son of the artist who painted
with Gruner and Norman Lind-
say years ago ; and some bright
and bold bits of water and bush
and rocks by William Dargie.
There are some of the larger,
shallower landscapes of Robert
Johnson ; attractive enough at a
distance but with the paint laid
on so clammily that one is
bogged in dry earth as if it were
wet clay. And, in the same
facile category, some thin Eric
Langker oils, among which
“Village Road,” with more depth
of paint and emotion, is some-
thing rather better.
The flowerpieces by Adrian
Feint, Paul Jones and Dorothy
Thornhill are all strangely
academic ; painted with meticu-
lous care but lifeless. The Feint
looks less like an original than a
handsome print; the prim
bouquets of Paul Jones look as
if they should have been painted
three or four centuries ago.
A few paintings by artists who
have reached the status of Aus-
tralian Old Masters Tom
Roberts and Rupert Bunny —are
of more interest to the collector
or the student than to the con-
noisseur. The Bunnys, one Aus-
tralian landscape, one possibly
south of France or possibly no-
where, and some girls in a park,
are sloppy pieces of work: pot-
boilers. The Tom Roberts oils
are vague and misty; mere
sketches which the artist would
probably never have exhibited.
A beautiful and spacious
Lance Solomon, “Country Life,”
makes certain that one does not
leave the mixed show with mixed
feelings, but with great pleasure ;
the pleasure of seeing a promise
fulfilled, of watching a powerful
technique develop the assurance
of maturity, of observing the
enlargement of Solomon’s
range ; and, simply,*the pleasure
of seeing a fine and distinctive
landscape. It is a picture of
open country, with a horseman
droving sheep in the foreground,
an eroded hill in the middle dis-
tance and ringbarked gums and
saplings in the background;
delicately drawn, subtly pene-
trated with light; a faithful ren-
dering of the Australian country-
side, and a piece of pure, magic.
* * * *
To follow the highly success-
ful Norman Lindsay exhibition,
a show of Streeton’s watercolors
is to be held at the Sedon Gal-
leries, Melbourne, from Sept.
28 to October 8. Fifty-three
watercolors will be exhibited,
covering Streeton’s work from
1888.
Ginette Neveu
Ginette Neveu, the violinist
whom Sibelius credited with
being the best living interpreter
of his music, justified the judg-
ment when she appeared last
week at Melbourne Town Hall
as soloist with Eugene Goossens
and the Melbourne Symphony
Orchestra in the composer’s
violin concerto in D Minor.
Miss Neveu’s physical per-
formance was almost as stag-
gering as her musical achieve-
ment. She appeared to play in
a state of hypnosis, with the
perspiration pouring down her
face, her eyes' closed and with
her instrument jammed so hard
against her thorax that it left
what looked like great weals on
her neck-muscles. Added to
which she kept bringing her bow
down on the strings as if she
were striking an anvil, not a
violin, and standing all the time,
braced, legs straddled and only
the red cap needed to make a
perfect model for one qf the
maenads of the French Revolu-
tion.
That was the visual impres-
sion. The musical one was of an
extraordinarily passionate per-
former who bowed her way
through the 40 minutes of the
opus and its complicated texture
of colors and rhythms with the
greatest delicacy and feeling.
Essie Ackland.
Essie Ackland’s rich contralto
has developed warmth and
mellowness, qualities which,
together with an excellent judg-
ment, lent great authority to her
oratorio numbers at her matinee
recital at Sydney Town Hall last
Saturday. “He Shall Feed His
Flock,” from “The Messiah,”
was an object-lesson in legato
delivery at half-power with
velvet-smooth transition between
the registers, allied to fine clarity
of diction. A fervor, deep and
well-controlled, was inherent in
her singing of Mendelssohn’s
“Oh Rest In the Lord.” A group
of lieder, which lost nothing
through being sung in English,
included Brahms’ fine “Sapphic
Ode” and “Sunday,” which the
contralto gave with suitable
rhapsodic lilt. Richard Strauss’s
“Tomorrow” was serene and
limpid. An interesting and
effective song was Peter Cor-
nelius’s “Monotone,” in which
the accompaniment gives the
contrasting melody with the
voice singing on the one note
throughout. One of the best
numbers was Max Reger’s
“Virgin’s Cradle Song,” beauti-
fully sung.
"Love From a
Stranger."
Neva Carr-Glyn and Mar-
garet Raynor in the first act of
“Love From a Stranger” (Syd-
ney Minerva) almost succeed in
reducing the murder-thriller to
comedy. The audience gathers
at last that there is dirty work
ahead, but the revelation comes
almost too late, and the play
nearly sinks without a trace.
Grant Taylor, a suave mixture
of slime and candor, saves it.
As Bruce Lovell, an unconvicted
Canadian murderer who sweeps
Cicely Harrington (Neva Carr-
Glyn) off her feet, he brings the
play on to the right note.
With a change of scene to the
country cottage, Neva Carr-
Glyn’s study deepens into an
expressive portrayal of a girl
becoming aware of the strange
alliance she has made. The play
and clash of character, the sane
decency of an English girl
against the developing designs of
a homicidal maniac, carries the
play smoothly along the familiar
groove of Agatha Christie’s
novel.
In the last scene, with the wife
talking desperately for her life,
there is a stretch of intense act-
ing, which shows how good the
first act could have been and
how bad it is. Aileen Britton
(of whom too little is seen), John
O’Malley, William Raynor and
Betty Duncan are the usual
murder-mystery incidentals.
S.U.D.S.
At the Conservatorium last
week, Sydney University
Dramatic Society hurled forth
Shakspeare’s “Pericles” and
Jean Cocteau’s “Orphee” with
a furious, bellowing determina-
tion that would have penetrated
a concrete air-raid shelter, let
alone the consciousness of an
audience. That is, the sound
and little else would have pene-
trated.
“Pericles” suffered most.
Lopped of Act I and Scenes ii
and iii, Act 11, played in Napo-
leonic costume and shouted at
speed and din that made one
wish for the peace and quiet of
the Ring at Randwick on Satur-
day, it was largely unintelligible.
John Lawrence, as Pericles, suc-
cessfully managed to shout down
everyone else, while David
Chenoweth as Helicanus, Laric
Hawkins as Cleon, Freda Leslie
as Dionyza, Pauline Gallagher as
the brothel-keeper, Frank Lucas
—remarkably like a Hollywood
caricature of an Italian fish-
monger—as Simonides and Nigel
Hawkins as Gower, the narrator,
occasionally managed to holler
loud enough to be heard above
the general din.
June Wimble, as Marina, and
John Mawson, as Lysimachus,
gave their roles some semblance
of conviction by modulating
both their voices and action
within reasonable bounds, while
Gordon Gostelo.w, as Boult, the
brothel tout, offered the most
sensible and acceptable acting of
the evening. Most of the sup-
porting cast spoke with a queer,
corrugated diction, as though
they were trying to speak Welsh
or carrying on a conversation on
a hurdy-gurdy.
“Orphee,” a kind of “modern-
ist” caricature of the myth, is
lively, stylised and has humor,
thin though it is—with its sym-
bolism and airy wit, it probably
has 1 enough substance to make an
excellent light humorous ballet.
Nigel Hawkins played Orphee
and Helene Chryssikos Eurydice,
and, although they were too fast
and too noisy and their boister-
ous enthusiasm wasn’t an effec-
tive substitute for the necessary
light Gallic touch, their per-
formances at least didn’t make
one want to shelter behind a
seat from the histrionic barrage.
The Kuringai Theatre Guild
presented Maugham’s “The
Circle” at the Killara Hall last
Saturday night. The produc-
tion, to be reviewed here next
week, and which will be repeated
tonight and on September 25
and 29 and on October 13 and
16, is one of -the best perform-
ances of light modern comedy
seen around Sydney for months.

RED MILL RUM.
The bookies reaped a rare harvest
at Rosehill on Saturday, where favqr-
ites were beaten in six of the nine
races. It was stiff luck for the S.T.C.
that it should have struck such un-
pleasant weather for its most attrac-
tive programme; however, attendance
was fairly good at 35,000.
The distance of the Rosehill
Guineas was increased this year to
10 furlongs—an excellent notion; but
the race did not, as had been expec-
ted, single out any one horse as an
outstanding prospect for what looks
a very open Derby, nor even particu-
larly reduce the number who must be
conceded a first-fate chance. With so
many having a chance, and the attrac-
tion of lavishly-increased prizemoney,
the Derby field may go close to the
record number of 17 that started in
Trivalvc’s year.
The Guineas was won by Royal
Andrew (A. Mulley), and won well
enough to possibly make him favorite
for the Derby, but at least half-a-
dozen others ran very good races.
Finishing strongly, though appearing
to be held by the winner, Bernbrook
was beaten three parts of a length;
third, a similar distance further back,
Snowstream, with his four white socks
pounding in great style, gave the im-
pression, more than any of the others,
that another half-furlong might have
seen him the winner. Bold Duke,
Ungar and Comic Court were all
handy at the finish, and connections
of the Melbourne visitor Clement de-
clared themselves satisfied with his
performance. Riptide, too, made a
satisfactory enough showing, especially
considering that he was involved in a
couple of scrimmages and returned to
scale with one shoe hanging loose,
while his apprentice rider, Coles, was
given a month’s suspension; however,
connections of Riptide have, maybe
a little prematurely, given up hope of
his proving a stayer; they intend to
give the Derby a miss and tackle,
instead, some of the shorter w.f.a.
races.
The scratching of Columnist and
Lysander left a field of four to con-
test the w.f.a. Hill Stakes (B|f.), and
punters, influenced by Karachi’s big
advantage in the weights, strongly
favored him to beat Proctor (9.4),
Dark Marne (9.1), and Stamen (Bst.);
Karachi carried 7.11. Jumping straight
into the lead, N. Sellwood, on
Stamen, settled his mount down to
a quietly steady pace, and the others
were content to bowl along close on
his heels; Dark Marne was running
second, followed by Karachi and
Proctor. They maintained that order
to the home turn, where Dark Marne
raced to the front; Karachi set alter
him, but Dark Marne, m very
easy fashion, held off the challenge
and raced right away to a really good
win.
Dark Marne started at the surpris-
ingly good odds of 4 to 1 after as
much as 11 to 2 had been bet; most
punters evidently thought the distance
too short for him, but he’s too
thoroughly good a horse to be ex-
cluded from consideration in any race
on that score. With 8.13 he looks
about the best-handicapped animal in
the Metropolitan, and when one can
spot a provenly good horse, showing
good recent form, and well handi-
capped—well, why look any further !
Other Metrop. hopes contested the
Rosehill Handicap, which went to that
veteran battler Silver Link, who likes
nothing better than the Rosehill 12-
furlongs journey. Starting favorite
and ridden by Mulley, he downed
consistent Buonarotti Boy by a bare
half-head, with New Cashmere third.
As a result Silver Link may have a
crack at the Metrop.; if he does it will
be his fourth attempt, and he is yet,
to fill a place.
A good type of horse, and capable
of running a solid mile, The Groom
(E. Doon) attracted attention to his
Epsom prospects with a clear-cut win
in the seven-furlongs Theo Marks
Quality Handicap. The distance
proved a shade short for Titanic,
who nevertheless finished very fast to
beat Denali for second money.
As usual, the Epsom looks a very
open race. History, however, if it
can be taken as a guide, shows that
over the past 30 years the vast
majority of Epsom winners have car-
ried Bst. or more. The best prospects
in that category this year appear to
be Blue Legend, Heroic Sovereign,
The Groom, The Diver, Titanic,
Karachi and Crusader; also,to stretch
a point, De La Salle, who has 7-.13.
With a £lO,OOO Derby run on the
same day it is unlikely that any of
the best of the tfiree-year-olds will
tackle the Epsom, and, in any case,
only three Epsom-winners have been
of that age—the last in 1892.
Having carried 9.3 and beaten much
the same field -under handicap con-
ditions at her previous start, Wattle,
ridden by W. Cook, was justifiably
hot favorite to again beat her fellow
three-year-old fillies at level weights
in the Cinderella Stakes; she did so
in effortless fashion, lolanda and
Revenir filling the places.
The Kelso-trained Persist (E. Doon)
was withdrawn from the Cinderella
Stakes to contest instead the first
Parramatta Mixed (7f.), in which she
started at 50 to 1 and soundly
trounced her more fancied stablemate
Caribbean; the second Parramatta
went to favorite Slander (W. Cook)
and the Auburn Mixed (lOf.) to the
long-promising Chessman (A. Hazel-
ton). The Welter saw J. Thompson
land his sole winner of the day,
which was Haymarket, beating Lysan-
der and Tamasha in the closest of
finishes.
* * * *
The combination of Flemington,
good horses and ideal weather gave
Melbourne racegoers a near-perfect
afternoon’s sport on Saturday; it
would have been quite perfect had a
larger proportion of favorites been
co-operative.
The race of the day was the w.f.a.
Craiglee Stakes (10f.), with everyone
anxious to see how the New Zealand
visitor Howe would shape. A fine
big chestnut, remarkably similar in
appearance to Phar Lap, though of
a different shade of chestnut, he
attracted attention before the race,
and was certainly not disgraced in
the running. Obviously in need of
the run, his first in Australia, he
showed speed by leading early and,
without getting a place, he beat more
home than beat him.
. Lungi (J. Purtell) became an even
more solidly established Melbourne
Cup favorite by winning the Craiglee
well from Beau Gem and Chanak.
Beau Gem led them into the straight,
but Lungi gained the run-through on
the rails and his brilliant finishing
burst settled the matter.
Lungi was favorite for the Craiglee,
as was the Caulfield Cup fancy Lucky
Robin for the 13-furlongs September
Handicap, but Lucky Robin’s per-
formance was as bad as the other’s
was good. In a field of 12, Lucky Robin
beat only one home; the winner was
Miss Prim (J. Gilmore), once again
at long odds (20 to 1), and a shade
too good for Sir Actor and Bailer-
dale in a close finish.
With no fewer than 38 runners
engaged, the six-furlongs Exford
Handicap for three-year-olds was a
good betting race—that is to say, one
best left well alone. Scotwyn was
favorite at eights but didn’t make
much of a showing. Gay Archer at
9 to 1, and ridden by V. Hartney,
scored quite comfortably from Royal
Hero and Raysun. The NorthcOte
Handicap of the same distance was
nearly as bad with 27 starters, and
again the favorite (Allied Power)
proved ill-chosen; Beau John (N.
Powell) was the winner; Gay Saint
and Flemish the placegetters.
Catering for the potential stayers,
the Burleigh Handicap, also confined
to three-year-olds, was run over 10
furlongs; favorite and a clear winner
from Bartonge and Rocket Gun was
the Double Remove colt Sun Blast
(W. A. Smith). Anthelion (W. Wil-
liamson) and Lincoln (K. Neville)
took divisions of the Welter, while
Gallant Gentleman (L. Meenan) gave
favorite Lugano a pile of weight and
a drubbing in the Guildford Hurdle.

Still far too wily for most of the
younger brigade, Jack Crawford last
week won his fourth N.S.W. hard-
court singles title —nearly 20 years
after his first success in that event.
It’s a pity Jack was not sent with the
recent Davis Cup team; he’d have
strengthened it considerably.
A few very poor rounds, played
at a time when he should have been
in hospital, cost Australian golfer
Norman Von Nida his chance of
winning England’s prized Harry Var-
don trophy this year; as it was he
was just pipped, returning an average
of 71.35. The winner, Charles Ward,
had an average of 71.29. Last year
Von Nida won the trophy, which is
awarded annually to the professional

There has been much talk of Brad-
man receiving a knighthood, though
nothing has come of it. However,
Yorkshire, the very home of cricket
at its grimmest, has accorded Don
an honor which, in those parts at
least, would be considered to rank
no lower than a peerage life-mem-
bership of the county club. Bradman
is the first non-Yorkshireman to have
been thus honored, for the greatest
of English cricketers cannot play for
'Yorkshire unless born in that county.
Lancashire also gave Don life-mem-
bership.

For the first quarter of the V.F.L.
second semi-final the 75,000 at
M,C.G. saw Essendon and Melbourne
play like a couple of drapers’ Wed-
nesday teams to end the quarter 3.2
all. After that, with brief intervals
for squabbles and fights, Essendon
galloped all over the Demons and
won by 13.16 to 8.10. Essendon,
which now seems to have the premier-
ship sewn up, won by playing the
ball, whereas Melbourne played the
man, a tactic that never earned any-
thing but defeat in Australian Rules,

merchants, in England, commenced
their tour by playing Huddersfield and
taking a frightful hiding in more ways

them and they also came off second
best in the stoush side of the game.

Displaying near-championship form,
Ray Coleman (8.13) defeated Billy
Watson (9.0) in a full-of-action con-
test at Leichhardt. Taller and longer
in reach, Watson Started like a certain
winner, and, outfighting Coleman in a
fierce rally as round five finished, his
winning prospects brightened. Wat-
son’s right eyebrow, gashed in the
second, began to bleed badly in
session six, however, and Coleman
did so well from then on that he
won a popular points decision. Some,
indeed, thought a draw would have
been in order, but our score-card
gave Coleman six rounds and Watson
five, with one even.

Lamps formerly consisted of a
crude wick soaking in a container
of oil or grease. In 1783, one
Argand made the revolutionary
discovery that a circular cotton wick,
with central draught and the flame
surrounded by a glass chimney,
increased the illuminating power
enormously. By 1860, petroleum
or kerosene had also displaced the
animal and vegetable oils formerly
used.
Effective as kerosene lamps became, particularly with
the advent of the incandescent mantle, they were
superseded by the rapid development of the electric
lamp—pre-eminent for clear lighting, safety and

Money and Production
In Sydney at the present time
it is generally conceded that
“things are quiet” in business ;
restaurants aren’t so crowded,
and wholesalers and retailers are
reporting that some stocks are
slow to move, the cutting-out of
clothes-rationing notwithstand-
ing. If this slackness in business
is a general thing, however, it
should not be interpreted as the
result of any tightness of money.
Never has the volume of spend-
ing-power in the hands of the
people been higher: the total
at June 30 was estimated offi-
cially at £1626 million, com-
pared with £1541 million a year
ago. And it is still rising.
The higher income from ex-
ports has been partly responsible
for the growth in paper-money
savings. Also, “full employ-
ment” and higher wages have
had their effect, even though
these things tend to increase
consumption and prices in a
way that reduces some Kinds of
saving.
Skating round, to some ex-
tent, the essential problem of in-
creased production—to which he
made special reference in his
previous report —H. T. Armi-
tage, governor of the Common-
wealth Bank, has some com-
ments to make on a develop-
ment which became particularly
pronounced after the introduc-
tion of the 40-hour week:
Towards the end of 1947 it became
increasingly evident that the Aus-
tralian economy showed disquieting
signs of inflationary pressure. As
the war recedes into the past and con-
trols have been removed or discarded,
the central bank has been concerned
with the possibility that the latent
inflation held in check by war-time
controls would exert powerful and
increasing pressure against the remain-
ing containing-walls of the economy
and carry the Australian price-level
rapidly upwards.
Comparative figures taken out by
the bank reveal that the increase in
the volume of money in Australia
since mid-1939 to end-1947 is some-
what less than in the United King-
dom, Canada, the United States of
America and New Zealand; the per-
centage increases being lowest at 154
per cent, in the case of Australia and
highest in the case of the United
Kingdom at 186 per cent., followed
closely by the U.S.A, Retail prices
have, however, risen most in the
U.S.A. and Canada with 68 per cent,
and 45 per cent, increases respectively;
the comparable figure for Australia is
34 per cent. Admittedly the retail
index is not a completely satisfactory
guide to relative movements, and in-
ternational comparisons can be mis-
leading.
Wage increases relative to the pre-
war level are 42 per cent, in the case
of Australia, as against 86 per cent,
in the case of the U.S.A. These
figures suggest that where war-time
controls have been lifted early, as in
the case of the U.S.A., the price-
and wage-level has adjusted itself
fairly rapidly to the war-time in-
crease in the volume of money. In
countries where controls have held
the inflation in check it is reasonable
to suppose that, if they are removed,
the way will be open for a consider-
able upward movement in prices to
release the pressure from the accumu-
lations of liquid funds. There is no
reason, of course, to expect any con-
sistent relationship between the price-
level and the volume of money; nor
need one country repeat the experi-
ence of another. But it is fairly
obvious that in Australia, where war-
time controls effectively held price
movements in check, the removal of
controls could, in the light of the
existing volume of liquid funds, per-
mit a price rise of some magnitude
unless there were a recession overseas,
of which there is at present little sign.
Any price rise will be aggravated or
diminished according to the degree of
movement which occurs in wages and
salaries and to the way in which
productivity improves.
“The way in which produc-
tivity improves”—the phrase em-
braces the chief economic and
political problems of the
moment. Every Australian
should be doing his best to in-
crease essential production to
the point where obstructive
“controls” are unnecessary and
where the fear of continued
price-inflation ceases to exist.
“Full employment” and the 40-
hour week have brought about
a shortage of manpower with-
out a corresponding increase in
production. Taken in conjunc-
tion with the arrears of civil
constructional activity that was
a direct result of the war, this
inadequate productivity has
been followed by extreme com-
petition for material resources
available. Mr. Armitage com-
ments ;
The Australian economy is being
strained in several ways at the pre-
sent time. Firstly, there is the high
income resulting from exports; in
“And he says We can have it at wholesale price!"
the second place there is the high
level of private investment in build-
ings, machinery and stocks; and
finally there is the necessity for pub-
lic authorities to make up arrears of
investment in essential public ser-
vices
In most cases the present level of
prices and costs gives the producer,
even the relatively inefficient, a suffi-
cient margin of profit to justify him
in the attempt to enter new fields of
enterprise or to expand old ones.
The conditions which make this so
may change very rapidly under the
impact of rising prices m Australia,
of good harvests elsewhere and the
recovery of overseas production. It
is reasonable to expect some decline
in the prices of the world’s staples
and some rise in Australian costs.
Just how far such movements will
go and how soon they will occur is
a matter of conjecture. The danger
of over-expansion is, however, a real
one, and it would be foolish to ex-
pect the relative competitive ad-
vantage of Australian industry to re-
main as good as it has been hitherto.
Encouragement should clearly be
given to the expansion of essential
production. The economy, however,
is already at or beyond the point of
full employment of resources, and in
particular our available supplies of
power and basic materials are being
strained to the utmost. Further in-
dustrial development will prove diffi-
cult, and present inflationary ten-
dencies will be strengthened, if these
crucial bottlenecks are not speedily
broken. It is of the utmost import-
ance that some resources at present
flowing to less essential production
should be diverted to serve these basic
needs of industry.
The years which lie immediately
ahead of us will be critical ones for
the Western democratic way of life.
Our problems and the problems of
our sister democracies will be solved
the easier if Australians of all classes
rise to their responsibilities at home
and abroad. The issue at stake is
more than a standard of living; it is
the possibility of ordered progress in
a free society.
Let Mr. Chifley, his Ministers
and all their trade-unionist
associates take note of those
final words.
N.Z. Forest Products
Australian shareholders in
N.Z. Forest Products, Ltd. —
there are 45,000 of them —will
be asking how much nearer divs.
are now the co. has clinched a
20-year contract with Australian
Newsprint Mills, Ltd., to supply
12,500 tons of kraft pulp a year.
David Henry and knight Keith
Murdoch fixed up the deal,
which is worth £300,000 to
£400,000 a year to Maoriland.
Forestry concerns have long
dreamed of the day when they
could begin turning M.L. pines
into money on a big scale, and
now they’ll have to step on it to
mill the trees as they reach the
pulping stage. The Australian co.
(with the financial backing of
the A.M.P. Society) will help by
putting up £BOO,OOO of money
to lift N.Z. Forest’s pulping
capacity from 10,000 tons to
25,000 tons annually. Shipments
will go to the paper-mill at
Boyer, Tasmania. A new town
at Tokoroa, 154 miles south of
Auckland, will become a big
pulping centre, and millions of
pounds’ worth of plant, mainly
Australian-made, will be wanted
for this and other pulp-mills in
the next few years.
Pines are growing at a fast
rate in New Zealand’s moist
climate. Forest experts estimate
the gain at more than three ship-
loads daily over the 800,000
acres under plantations, nearly a
quarter owned by N.Z. Forest
Products, with paid capital (at
March last) of £6,203,271. To
keep pace with this growth, on
a 20-year cycle from planting to
milling, will be a big task,
especially over the next few
years, until the industry gets
fully into its stride. “There is
urgency in utilising the main

cause it matures quickly and,

N.Z. Forest Products’ net
profit was a record of £56,419
last year (ended March), against
£37,872 in 1947 and £28,268 in
1946. Most of the gain came
from a drop of £15,000 in taxes.
Obstacles are shortages of rail-
way wagons, coal and electric
power and, on the export front,
lack of overseas shipping. In-
ternal bottlenecks aren’t likely
to disappear as output rises.
Directors and shareholders will
hope they don’t grow worse.

SLOOP versus JAP SQUADRON
The Story of Heroic H.M.A.S. Yarra
By "MACNELL"
“Devotion to duty” and
“heroism in the face of the
enemy” are platitudes—but are,
like most platitudes, full of
meaning. The terms' can be ap-
plied in good measure to the
epic fight Australian sloop
Yarra put up against odds that
would have vindicated her run-
ning for her life.
This stout little sea-fighter
was built at Cockatoo Dock in
Sydney and commissioned on
January 21, 1936. Rating just
over 1000 tons and knots,
she mounted three 4in. semi-
automatic quick-firing guns and
patterns' of depth-charges aft,
plus anti - submarine - detecting
gear.
A sloop is a versatile craft.
Design, speed and armament fit
her for fighting, minesweeping,
surveying, reconnaissance and,
with large fuel capacity, ability
to steam thousands of miles on
long convoy runs. Yarra’s guns
could throw a 401 b. shell eight
miles in surface action and ele-
vate almost vertically to engage
aircraft. A well-drilled crew
could load 20 rounds a minute.
In addition to offensive quali-
ties, sloops are the finest sea-
ships the writer has served in—
Yarra proved this soon after
war began by maintaining her
speed and distance with ships
20 times her weight when troop-
convoying in huge seas in the
Bight. Her commanding officer
was Lieut.-Commander (now
Captain) W. H. Harrington,
D. 5.0., R.A.N.
For nine months she patrolled
and convoyed in Australian
waters hard, uncomfortable
work —and though it offered
little chance of headlined glory,
her ship’s company in that time
were welded by careful plan-
ning, meticulous training and
rigid adherence to discipline
from a heterogeneous lot of
grocers, bank-clerks and shop-
assistants into a compact, disci-
plined fighting unit of proved
efficiency. So that in August,
1940, when she sailed into the
Red Sea wSth a convoy, she
needed only the blooding of her
first angry shot. This was fired
at Italian bombers seeking her
convoy.
At midnight two months later
two Italian destroyers from
Massawa essayed a torpedo
attack on a Mediterranean-
bound convoy escorted by Yarra
and British destroyer Kimber-
ley, classmate of Mountbatten’s
famous Kelly, It was a still,
moonlit night. One Italian fired
his torpedo in the general direc-
tion of Arabia and bolted. The
other, Francisco Nullo, was hit
by gunfire. It tried to limp
inshore under protection of
Italian coast batteries ; Kimber-
ley followed it in and blew the
enemy ship to pieces.
Yarra roasted in the Red Sea
for four months before orders
came for rest and refit in Bom-
bay. In April, 1941, she was
again at sea, coursing for the
head of the Persian Gulf.
Gulf of Hades
Arabs say hell lies under the
Persian Gulf, keeping it hot.
Entering through a passage
flanked on each hand by bald,
towering rock, sanctuary for
countless seabirds, the humid
heat pressed on them like a
tangible weight. Men’s hands
went instinctively to their
throats, and the sweat started to
run in rivulets. Luckily their
skins were well-baked by months
in the tropics.
On the bridge were double
awnings which a sailor hosed at
intervals with salt water. Along
the upper-deck hoses were
rigged and left running, but re-
lief between decks was not
noticeable. Directly over the
engine-room amidships water
rose in coils of white vapor. On
coming off watch it was the
surgeon’s orders that each
stoker-mechanic and engine-
room artificer was to drink a
cupful of salt water to replace
salt lost through perspiration.
On each side the sea lay mute,
smooth and sluggish as oil.
Looking down from the bridge
it was sometimes possible to see
a shark slither alongside, or a
, black-and-yellow sea-snake, as
venomous as any land variety,
squirming slowly near the sur-
face. Yarra breasted the torrid
heat, headed for Basra, 60 miles
up the Tigris.
For some time German in-
filtration of Iran had been caus-
ing concern. Hitler’s drive
through eastern Europe was
directed at Iran and Irak oil.
German agents were every-
where, inflaming riots and
demonstrations in Tehran and
Basra. The Iran Government
was approached by Britain,
without success, and Tehran
wavered and evaded the main
issue—expulsion of German
disruptionists.
Yarra’s job was to shut-up the
demonstrators. On May 4, in
terrific heat and beset by clouds
of mosquitoes and sandflies, the
sloop slid to a berth near the
British Consulate and laid all
guns on the roaring mob outside
it. They vanished like nomadic
tents. For three days she lay
there, until Gurkha troops
landed and clinched the argu-
ment.
But mosquitoes proved
tougher than Persians. Closed-up
continuously at action without
mosquito-nets, guns’ crews were
viciously bitten, and Yarra’s
captain reported that health of
his men was “lamentable.” At
one time 25 of her complement
of 100 were down with fever.
With daily temperatures of over
100 degrees F. and humidity 92
per cent., relief was urgently
necessary; and the ship was
ordered to Bombay, When two
days out she was recalled by
W/T —the Iranian Government
had ordered its warships to take
station in Karun River.
It was decided to take the
necessary naval action, to
occupy naval barracks and cap-
ture Axis merchantmen in the
vicinity. At dawn Yarra was in
position and opened fire on the
Iranian gunboats, silencing the
lot in an hour. Boarding-parties
clambered aboard and captured
their crews, while landing-parties
secured the Abadan oil refineries
near by. Everything was quiet
by noon, and Yarra was dis-
patched down the Gulf to deal
with Axis shipping at Bandar
Abbas.
Salvage
With the flanking coast hos-
tile, the sloop closed her harbor
after dark and sighted a burn-
ing ship 15 miles off. Captain
Harrington was in strange
waters; he had no pilot and no
idea of the identity of the burn-
ing ship, but after some smart
work on a Merchant Shipping
Guide he identified her as the
Italian Hilda. She had been
fired and scuttled by her crew.
As the sloop drew closer the
leadsman in the chains called:
“Five fathoms,” “Four
fathoms,” and then “Three
fathoms.” Assuming the
Italian to be aground, and hav-
ing no inclination to be likewise,
Captain Harrington withdrew
cautiously to a deserted anchor-
age near by, remaining there the
rest of the night and all next
day.
With darkness she attempted
salvage. Going gingerly along-
side her sizzling plates, Yarra
soon had hoses into the Italian
and a repair-party to -close all
ventilation. This proved effec-
tive, and by daylight fires were
out and all holes plugged. The
captain wrote in his Report of
Proceedings:— .
Among the ashes of the saloon
were found eating utensils which
had been used for breakfast. This
led me to believe that breakfast
on August 27 was the last meal
eaten on board, and I believe the
fires were then started, not all of
them being successful. Perhaps
smoke and flames caused the crew
to lose their nerve. One kitten
and two pigeons were found alive.
To ascertain if the merchant-
man was afloat Yarra’s engines

ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: When Sultana Sullivan
sighted the new schoolteacher in the little
Murray settlement he surveyed his
bachelor quarters, became conscious of
something lacking and began to hang his
hat up to the lady. She, having made
judicious inquiries as’ to the state of
Sultana’s possessions and problematical
future, decided that queening it over a
fruit block had its attractions and began
to encourage Sultana’s hopes. “Of
course,” she hinted prettily, “I had no
thought of marrying a horticulturist when
I came here.” Sultana hurriedly recalled
his almost forgotten Sunday-school days
and exploded. “That’s that crimson
blank of a Harris,” he roared. “The
blanker knows I’m a flamin’ Methodist!
He’s bin tellin’ you that just so you’d go
cold on a man. Anyhow, he ain’t bin
inside a church since he was christened.”
A month later, when that schoolteacher
was transferred to a suburban school, she
never tired of telling her literary circle
about the profanity and ignorance of
the average Murray fruitgrower.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: Strange that the
pirates’ associations with the W.A. coast
(B* 18/8/’4B) has not attracted more at-
tention from treasure-hunters. Koepang,
in the Dutch East Indies, was the head-
quarters of the pirates, who preyed on
the rich trading vessels, and many a
Jolly Roger must have sought shelter
“Youd better hurry, Mr. Blair — your quiz team-mates are Waiting
for you."
along our nor’-west coast. Just prior to
the 1914 stoush a mate of mine organised
an expedition to Berrier Island, some 30
miles due west of Carnarvon, to investi-
gate a wreck found at low tide by some
fishermen. It was submerged in a cave,
and a kedge anchor found some distance
out from the shore indicated that the
vessel had been sailed into the anchorage
from which it was intended that it should
be withdrawn by hauling on the anchor-
rope. The cave made a natural hideout
for a small vessel, which would be safe
there from pursuit by a man-o’-war.
My mate thought it likely it had been
sunk by a fall of rock from an overhang-
ing ledge. The project was abandoned
when the Kaiser’s war offered greater
scope for young, adventurous spirits, and
the wreck is probably still there. There
may be others; and the presence of gold
coins, found years ago near the mouth
of the Moore River, suggests that some-
where along the coast there may be trea-
sure worth seeking.
* * * *
“Lower Tops’l”: While the barque
Viking’s 139-days-passage from Spencer
Gulf to the Thames hit the cables, the
Passat’s voyage passed unnoticed,
although this fine four-master left weeks
after the Viking and arrived only a few
tides behind her. Even in pre-war days
Passat, with her black topsides and white
accommodation-housing amidships, was
the largest and most up-to-date square-
rigger left afloat. Built in 1911 by Laeisz,
of Hamburg, to compete with steamers in
the Chilean nitrate run, the barque was
famous for her turn of speed and her
flair for running - down steamers, or
rather the steamers’ inability to judge her
pace —she sank three. Joining the Erik-
son fleet in 1932, she won the grain race
in 1934, and two years later went home
in 87 days, being beaten by the crack
Herzogin Cecile by a day—with one ex-
ception, the two best passages home since
World War I.

“C.A.L.”: The whales which navigated
the narrow channel leading into Corio
Bay and visited Geelong (B. 11/8/’4B)
were in all probability “Sammy” and
“Fanny.” Before the barrage was built
at Goolwa these mammals annually made
their pilgrimage up the Murray and
Darling to a pool opposite Henley
station shearing-shed, where they would
spend a short summer season. The
shearers would encourage them to stay
with scraps from the kitchen, and the
boss-of-the-board would spend hours
stroking their backs with a long sapling
as they lazed on a sunny sand-bar where
the water was shallow. Instead of purring
they showed appreciation of the massag-
ing by spouting jets of water high into the
air, it falling in graceful cascades on to
the shed roof. The shearers welcomed
this water-cooling system, and for reward
would feed the whales loaves of the
cook’s soddy bread. But there are some
things even a whale can’t stomach. After
their departure for the ocean again at
the “cut-out,” the loaves have been picked
up on the beach at Victor Harbor in the
form of ambergris.

“Chuck”: Smithy’s block isn’t large,
but by extensive cropping and a bit of
irrigation he managed to shunt off a
regular quota of fats. With the increase
in price, Smithy decided the place would
now feed two, so disappeared cityward
to marry the girl who’d been waiting
more or less faithfully till things im-
proved. “It’s a great help,” he confided
to Charlie a few weeks later. “Jenny
just loves animals. She takes a great in-
terest in every one of them.” That month
Smithy’s usual draft of fats didn’t go off.
The next, too, showed no sale. Neighbors
noticed his animals falling off in condi-
tion, while the paddocks grew bare, and
their owner’s dial developed rugged
furrows of worry. Then Charlie rode
over to see if he could get a few killers.
“Don’t matter if they ain’t real fat,” he
explained. “Long as they’re eatable.”
Immediately Smithy’s missus turned on
him. The onslaught was unexpected and
shattering, and presently Charlie found
himself outside, bewilderedly feeling for
his nag. “See how it is, Chari?” Smithy
had followed him out. “The place is over-
stocked, and most of the feed’s gone, but
“A little more — he's still a bit underdone
cripes, what’s a man t’ do? I tell y’, I
get a mob fat, an’ then she won’t part
with none of ’em, not unless I swear on
oath they’re goin’ to a real good home
and won’t be killed! ”

“Blime”; Collecting the mail at the
post-office, I sorted it .and handed a letter
to Dill, who glanced at the contents,
crushed it hurriedly in his fist, eyed a
couple of bystanders suspiciously, then,
shoving the letter into his pocket, walked
out. “It was the money for that nag I
sold,” he confided as we neared his hut.
“Come in, will y’?” He stared round the
horizon carefully, and when we entered
the hut, closed the door and chucked
some loose junk against it. Then, tip-
toeing to the corner, he moved a pile of
bags, prised up a couple of floorboards
and began digging underneath. Presently
a small flat box was unearthed; opening
it. the owner added his latest cheque to
10 or a dozen others within. “ ’Struth, a
bloke’s riskin’ his neck keepin’ these
things,” he whispered. I picked up a 10-
quid cheque dated two years previously.
“That’s for them rabbitskins I sold,”
Dill said nervously. “An’ this November
forty-six one is the contract job I done
for ol’ Collins. Remember?” “But,
cripes, Dill,” I exploded. “Why didn’t
y’ cash ’em, or pay ’em in?” “What!”
he scowled. “An’ let them flamin’ inkum
blokes grab a hunk of ’em? Not on y’r
flamin’ life!”
* * * *
“C.E.”: Don took up life on his new
block, rich in ideas but poor in experi-
ence. It was a clean property, excepting
for a steep hill at one end; this he was
clearing by fire at the foot of the hill
when old Ted rode through. “Y’
don’t pick-up a hill from the bottom,” he
told the young bloke. “Y* start on the
top an’ work down.” “You do, y’ mean,”
Don replied. “Fire travels uphill, don t
it? Well, if these run, they’ll burn the
stuff ahead, see? It’s time a few brains
were brought into this cockyin’ work.”
Ted let it go, and in the days that fol-
lowed watched as the newchum’s work
crept daily higher up the hillside. Then-
one morning he noticed an enormous log
down on the flat. Round on the next fall
was another giant trunk, with Don con-
templating it perplexedly, “Look at those
things,” the newchum scowled. “Burnt
off and rolled down. Can’t leave them
here; they’re too solid to burn by them-
selves, and there’s nothing around.
What’s a bloke to do?” “Don’t ask me,”
shrugged old Ted, kinking his neck to-
wards the fires above. “I bet it’s up t’
them brains o’ youfs now t’ get ’em back
up.”
* * * *
“Betcha”: A fox doesn’t waste energy
digging out the whole of a rabbit-burrow;
instead, on finding one occupied by a
nest of kittens, he scratches down directly
over the nest and removes the youngsters.
Nor does he make a mistake in the spot
to dig, the only time he misses out being
when the kittens are old enough to realise
his onslaught means danger, and retreat
back along the burrow out of reach. Was
under the impression Johnny used his
nose for locating the nests, but old Jim’s
claim that his ears do the job sounds
more reasonable. Jim states that on
occasion he has located the position of
the nest himself by placing an ear to the
ground and picking up the snuffling
grizzle of the kittens. He admits, though,
that the bunnies weren’t far underground
when he found them. However, with
Johnny’s keener sense, it is not improb-
able he can pick up the tell-tale noise
much deeper. Have often come on his
excavations after kittens to a depth of
over 1 Sin.
* * * *
“Lower Tops’!”: “Bosun’s Mate” is
playing on technicalities and trivialities
when he says that those charts marked
“Aus.” are Australian and therefore are
not Admiralty charts (B. 28/7/’4B).
Theoretically they are Australian, of
course, but they are the equivalent 'of
Admiralty charts, being compiled by a
unit of the British Navy by basic methods
learnt from the Admiralty. And I still
say some Admiralty charts had a New
Look long before this year. My copy
(secured 1942) of chart No. 2764—-sheet
two of the Coral Sea—for instance, has
the land colored a creamy yellow, and it
is an Admiralty chart. My copy was re-
produced here in 1941 “by the Hydro-
graphic Branch, Sydney, with permission
of the ‘Hydrographer’,” but if there is the
distinction “8.M.” tries to make out, why
isn’t “Hydrographic Branch” and the
“Hydrographer” qualified by “Australian”
and “Admiralty”? Anyway, neither the
Admiralty nor the R.A.N. was the first
to brighten up marine charts. That dis-
tinction belongs to the Germans. When
in 1914 the present Commonwealth
Director of Navigation (Captain J. K.
Davis) took command of the A.I.F. trans-
port “A. 36” —the captured German
steamer Boonah—he found to his sur-
prise that all the German charts were
colored, even down to the different sectors
of the lights.
* * ♦ *
“Gravelsnatcher”: A Perth man be-
lieves that he has a method of combating
white-ants. He uses a mixture of spirits,
wax and a toxic compound, and claims
that it “completely preserves timber from
the ravages of termites and borers and
prevents dry-rot in brickwork.” It is
designed to protect material, not to
destroy the termites, and if it fulfils its
purpose it should save the world millions
of pounds annually. But I’m doubtful.
The termite is an adaptable cove, used
to vicissitudes. Forgotten by nature
when the original ration-cards were
issued, it found itself destined to a diet
of left-overs —the woody parts of plants
scorned by the herbivores. It can’t digest
wood —never could —and it avoided ex-
tinction by enlisting the co-operation of
a particular type of protozoon which can
digest cellulose. These protozoa live in
the termites’ intestines, digest the wood
passed down by the insects, and are then
digested by their host. To a race capable
of such an arrangement, impregnated
wood should prove a minor obstacle. The
inventor is mystified, too, by the disap-
pearance of several colonies into whose
nests he introduced pieces of the treated
wood. A little study would bring an ex-
planation. The world, incensed at the
survival of a race which had been doomed
at its inception, treats the termite as
either an enemy or a delicacy. Once the
outer defences of the termites’ castle are
broached the liquidation of the colony
becomes an easy matter for any of the
scores of ants and insects which love
termites —for dinner. But the loss of a
colony or two is nothing to the only race
on earth which can compete with man
for earth-supremacy.
WHITE IN THE EYE.
You don’t like that lift of his quarter,
You don’t like that white in his eye;
You’ve been told he’s a regular snorter
And throws himself into the sky.
You hope when outside you can hold him,
They say he’s a beggar to bolt;
And you curse the old besom who foaled him,
A rough and unrideable colt.
You’ve chosen the shortest of switches
As handier far than a whip;
’ You’ve dampened the seat of your breeches
In hope it will add to your grip.
You look at your bools and are brought to
Make choice in a matter of doubt —
To ride him with spurs as you ought tfo,
Or ride him, more safely, without.
You’re glad that the yard is no wider
And thankful the timbers are tall,
And wish you were more of a rider
With not so much chance of a fall.
You check up the length of your leathers,
You pull up the slack in his girth,
And you wish for a yard full of feathers
Instead of this hard-trodden earth.
Then, damning the lads on the fences
Who grin as they wish you good luck
And are scaring you out of your senses
With “Mind you, this beggar can buck!”
Assuming an attitude bolder,
You scorn indecision and fear,
And take up your place at his shoulder
And get a good grip of his ear.
And telling yourself you can boss him,
Though doubtful, it must be confessed,
You swing a leg gently across him
And sit back and hope for the best!

“Hannan’s St.”: The golden age for
hat-wearers must surely have been the
early days of Kalgoorlie and other W.A.
gold camps. The Australian felt-hat in-
dustry being yet unborn —this was before
the time of the famous “Three hatters” —
W.A. importers specialised in a London-
made lid, the Woodrow. Never will its
like be seen again. With a full-bodied,
shape-keeping crown, it carried a broad
rim which, scorning thd cheapness of
braid, had a half-inch turnover sewn all
around. It was as specialised to the west
as the 10-gallon was to Texas. Seen in
Melbourne’s Collins-street it marked the
wearer as a sliverish gent, from golden
W.A.; with the inevitable pursuit of every
kind of confidence-man, ticket-seller and
faker. The price, in Hannan’s-street,
17s. 6d.; which in other parts of Aus-
tralia meant a fairly big price for a hat,
but just suited the W.A. goldfields pocket,

for years now these two have taken me
through the Riverina and into Victoria.
On the dry, dusty Hay-Balranald lead
I have camped with them, a disembodied
spirit, and I have watched the ibis rise
from the channels alongside the Griffith-
Leeton track. Many an hour have I also
spent with them under the willows on the
’Bidgee at Wagga seeking the elusive cod.
But now I can stand it no longer. When
“Mat’s Mate” relates an incident ob-
served from the balcony of the Albion
at Cootamundra (best bluidy poob in the
sooth) where I braced my nerves for the
nuptial ceremony and where I wet the
head of my firstborn, then my nostalgia
overwhelms me; no longer can I, an

sorrow, bear this constant reminder of
days and scenes that are gone. How I
long for the blistering heat of Goolgowi

“Mat’s Mate”: When we got back to
our Mallee job from a fortnight in the
city all the locals seemed mighty anxious
to hear about it. Mostly, however, they
were satisfied with our explanation that
we’d had “a pretty good time an’ was
glad t’ be back.” Fred was different.
He’d never been to Melbourne and he
wanted to know if all the things he’d
read and heard about it were true. He
came to our camp at sundown and was
still asking questions at 11 p.m. In the
end Mat became exasperated. “Look,
Fred,” he declared, “it’s this way. Mel-
bourne is a good bit bigger than Murray-
ville—it has two post-offices for one
thing, an’ the picture-show is open every
night, see? What’s more, from what I
seen of both places I’d reckon Mel-
bourne is more likely t’ go ahead than
Murrayville. Now drink your tea an’

“Shellback”: How deep is the Indian
Ocean? A glance at the map shows an
area practically devoid of islands except
along the continental shelves of Asia,
Africa and Australia, where naturally
islands, vestiges of a shrunken coastline,
might be expected to be ; yet round about
the centre this almost landlocked ocean
seems to be bare of land eruptions. I
have met old shellbacks who declare
otherwise ; not more than 200 miles west
of Fremantle, as an instance, one comes
on a great sandbank always submerged,
but at low-tide covered so slightly that
it is possible to wade with a seine-net,
capturing a tiny fraction of the myriads
of fish that swarm over this untouched
preserve. Since the sea-lanes that con-
verge on Fremantle run mostly within the
compass lines of north-west and south-
west there remains a vast triangle of
ocean which may be regarded as prac-
tically unexplored, within which vast
areas of shallow and sandbank may exist.
Back in 1837 Lieut. George Grey, voyag-
ing in a Dutch hooker from the Cape to
the Prince Regent River in the W.A.
north-west, made entries in his diary con-
cerning fish and fowl that seem’ to indi-
cate the finding of quite shallow water in
mid-ocean.

“Old Camp”: Gentlemen operating
with a double-headed penny were seldom
so foolish as to operate alone. The
modus operandi around such universities
“ Don't be so impatient, John; We'll only be ten minutes”
of two-up as early Coolgardie and
Boulder was for a gang to organise the
ring. Human . nature being what it is,
there was always a sufficiency of mugs
to make up a school. But even with an
organised gang the double-header would
be rung-in only occasionally. And then,
if trouble did start, the gang could be
relied on to meet it, though once I did
see a crook spinner running for it.
Chased off the Great Boulder lease, he
might have been pulled down by the
pursuit and badly dealt with. However,
as he reached the Boulder No. 1 shaft he
found the cage waiting at the surface.
Slowing down, he walked to the shaft,
stepped into the cage and signalled the
engine-driver to lower to No. 3. Think-
ing him a miner or somebody connected
with the parent Great Boulder the driver
obeyed. Thus he was 500 ft. down by the
time the pursuit reached the mouth of the
shaft. Then there was the case of Mills,
a second-rate pug, detected ringing in a
double-header at Kumalpi. With his
back against a tree Mills invited the
crowd to “come on.” There were no
takers ; but he had to leave the camp a
couple of days later.

“Nubis”: Can’t agree with “Bughouse”
or “Conda” (B. 18/8/’4B) as to what
happens to a ship sunk in deep water.
Let “Bughouse” sink an open kerosene-
tin in ,10ft. of water. The weight of
water pressing on each side of the tin
will be more than 8001 b the tin
won’t collapse, because the water pres-
sure is exerted in every direction and the
pressure on the outside is balanced by
that inside. It is different with sub-
marines, which, being hermetically sealed,
have no compensating thrust from the
inside. In salvage operations it is usually
found that the hull of the ship is more or
less intact. In the case of the Egypt and
the Niagara, not only did the divers have
to blast their way through the hulls, but
also into the ships’ strongrooms. Dis-
integration due to erosion takes a long
time. Part of the Dunsky, wrecked off
Wilson’s Inlet (W.A.) in 1917, is still
visible, although it lies within a few feet
of the shore and is subjected every year
to heavy buffeting by southerly gales.

“Zake”: The confounding of Straw-
berry when she practises birth-conceal-
ment in scrub country takes many forms.
I have heard of the enthusiast who spent
hours perfecting the imitation of a calf’s
call, only eventually to be treed by the
calf’s inquiring and incensed sire. Others
favor yarding the mother all night, the
consequent uproar from the neglected off-
spring being claimed to be heard at a
three-mile range. But the simplest and
most effective method was used by a
cocky near Muswellbrook (N.S.W.). He
would just let his dog go past the cow,
which prompted Strawb, to make off in
the general direction of the planted calf.
He and the hound would follow, invari-
ably successfully.
* * * *
“Colonial Cove”; Having had long
acquaintance with “the old convict who
knew of a secret goldmine,” I am a trifle
interested by “S. Gums’s” notions of how
such ojd lags lived (B. 25/8/’4B). A
Crown prisoner arrived, might either be
released at once on ticket-of-leave, or
remain in durance. Only while in durance
would he be able to rely on the Govern-
ment’s providing him with board and
lodgings. For this he worked about 10
hours a day, either in Fremantle jail or
on the roads. Over him stood armed
warders. So his opportunities for dis-
covering gold reefs were distinctly limited.
From durance he graded to t. 0.1. Here
he had to provide for himself, so his first
necessity was to get a job. Here again
his opportunities for finding goldmines
were circumscribed, since most jobs were
on farms. Farmlands then didn’t extend
much beyond York, while the gold
country, when it was found, lay quite
150 miles further east, a trifle too far
for even a t. 0.1. man to locate even if he
had an occasional Sunday off. The
convict’s third stage was conditional
pardon, which meant that whereas a
t. 0.1. had to report at the nearest police-
station once a month, the c.p. man was
at liberty to move anywhere provided he
didn’t leave the colony. He still had to
scratch for his food and bed—and hard
they were to come by. Still, there may
have been one convict that fitted “S.G.’s”
recipe—one of the earliest finds made on
the way to Coolgardie was a convict’s
shoe. Perhaps the wearer found Bayley’s
reef before Bayley did. If he did he
certainly kept the secret safe —for all
time, so far as he was concerned.

“T.F.”: Horses may not take ad-
vantage of a campfire’s heat (B. 1/9/’4B),
but they’re not shy when it comes to using
the smoke. In bad sandfly country they
will crowd in almost on top of the fire
to get away from the little pests. They
get more sleep than the tailer, who has to
keep a string of smudges going to reserve
a bit of smoke for himself.
* * * *
“Wusslean”: I’ve been waiting for the
long-haired readers of the Abo, pages to
rush in as one woman and inform “Zake”
(B. 21/7/’4B) that there was some slight
deception surrounding the successful
wager that “a pig which had drunk a
bucketful of skim-milk couldn’t weigh
any more than before he had scoffed it.”
Mere men might be taken down over
such a matter, but every woman with any
knowledge of infant welfare knows that
the standard method of ascertaining how
much a baby is imbibing by way of
nourishment is to weigh the child imme-
diately before and after a feed. Natural
processes ensure fairly rapid return to
normalcy in weight, but that there is
immediate gain is unquestionable. “Z.s”
guess was that “the milk created gases
which had the effect of lightening the pig
on the scales to the extent of offsetting the
extra poundage taken on.” If his guess
was right, infant-welfare practice in this
respect is utterly unsound; my guess is
the astute cove who collected the bets
merely contrived —pigs being much of a
muchness —to weigh-in the wrong porker.
* * * *
“Perrebinpa”: We have caught a large
number of sharks in the last two years
at Macleay Island (Q.), mostly of the
so-called “tiger” variety. Post-mortems
revealed that they had eaten turtles, green
and spiny toads,, mud- and sandcrabs,
whiting, tuna, stone-fish and cormorants.
One 12-footer’s stomach contained the
remains of a large mako or white shark,
another a turtle measuring four by three
feet, and intact. No cephalopod remains
have been identified so far. It is possible
they are eaten by other varieties of sharks
not caught by our lines and nets. Their
most surprising meal is sea-snake. Most
of the tiger sharks examined contained
several. As the sea-snake is classed as
very venomous, it is puzzling to me why
the shark isn’t bitten and poisoned when
devouring it, or why, if bitten, it should
be immune to snake-venom. As for
octopuses hiding among rocks and other
sheltered spots (B. 25/8/’4B), they don’t
only keep to these. I noticed several
resting on the piles at Sydney’s Circular
Quay in full view of any enemy. We
have also captured them roaming over
the oyster-beds well above low-tide mark.

“Bo”: McCarthy, the elongated slow-
spoken cove, confided to Willard the
mailman that his long bachelorhood on
his outlying block was coming to an end
—he had selected a wife by post, ex-
changes of letters and photos through a
matrimonial agency in the city having
proved mutually satisfactory. He pro-
posed to go down to the city to meet
and marry the lady and bring her home.
The mailman suggested that he, McCarthy,
would be getting excited about the im-
minent acquisition of a brand-new wife,
but the phlegmatic bachelor denied it.
“What’s there in it to git excited about?”
he drawled in answer. The day after
McCarthy was due to have left to collect
his bride the mailman, driving past, was
surprised to see the old bachelor still
pottering around in flannel and moleskins.
He pulled up. “Thought you was goin’
down to the city yest’day, Jim?” he said.
McCarthy looked up, thought for half a
minute, then spoke. “Aw, I left all
right,” he said. “Just gettin’ on the train
when I remembered I hadn’t put the beef
in the pickle-cask. If I hadn’t come back
it’d all gorn bad on a man!”
TOURIST.
The man whose body travelling outstripped his
laggard mind
Was waiting on our envy and a little mocking
us,
That we were drinking beauty of a too-familiar
kind
While he discussed Vienna in a Kalamunda
bus.
It’s high and thirsty summer on the brown road
through the range,
The slender shadows of the trees lean back-
ward lest they spill
Their darkness on the sunset track, and now
there comes a change—
He’s talking of the Matterhorn upon Les-
murdie hill.
If when I go to London town I meet that
traveller
I’m sure ’twill lift my homesick heart if I
may take his hand;
He’ll not be seeing London then, his mind will
be elsewhere:
He may have reached Mundaring when I
meet him in the Strand.

In the Channel Country.
“Archaps”: Although most
properties in the Cooper’s Creek
channel country run Shorthorns,
Mt. Leonard, near Windorah,
owned by S. B. Sinclair, has
found Herefords very successful.
A lot of the country is very
stony, and the cattle have to
walk for their feed, but H.
Richards, who has managed the
property for 25 years, says the
Herefords will go .out as far as
the fences will allow them. Mt.
Leonard has a herd of 5000, the
limit in a bad season. Average
rainfall for the past 24 years was
515 points. This year 600 fats
have been sent to Quilpie for
trucking, and a second draft of
580 for the south are to be
trucked at Marree.
The great need in the de-
velopment of the channel
country is a railway from Bourke
to Camooweal to enable full
advantage to be taken of the
good seasons. Today stock-
routes from Boulia to Windorah
are in a bad state, and stock have
to use the Bedourie route, 25,000
head having passed through Mt,
Leonard heading for the south.
Without a railway to transport
stores and fats, properties today
have to stock on the basis of a
dry year, and the advantages of
a good season in the channel
country are largely lost. For
the maximum turn-off of fats
each year a railway is essential.
“Blackmarket” Shearers.
“Master-Bevel”: Although it
was hoped the recent increase in
shearing rates and concessions to
learners would attract more
young men into shearing, it has
apparently not done so, and the
industry will face a shortage of
manpower for some time to
come. In the case for a new
pastoral award many reasons
were given for the increasing
shortage of shearers, but one,
which has some bearing on the
matter, was not heard at all.
This is the general attitude of
the average sheepowner, who
seems to consider the shearer
pretty low in the social scale ;
a fellow whose word is not
worth much, and who will prob-
ably get boozed at the nearest
pub, leave half the wool on the
sheep or cut them to pieces. Ad-
mittedly, there are such men in
the shearing teams, but they are
few and far between.
The grazier should take stock
of himself for a change. De-
cency and honesty are not by
any means exclusive to owners.
For instance, many complaints
were heard in one district about
very rough shearing. The fact
was that many owners in that
district, fearing a big in
the price of wool, went on “the
blackmarket” to get shearers,
even at the expense of their
neighbors. They offered as' much
as £6 to £7 10s. a 100 to en-
tice men to leave their sheds.
Only one type of man will bite
at this bait, and the result is
obvious.
In a very short time that dis-
trict had collected the scum of
the teams for many miles
around —and from other parts.
If the offending owners had
waited patiently, like their
neighbors, they would have had
their sheep shorn by decent
teams at award rates —and in
plenty of time to catch the high
market.
The genuine shearers have to
bear a bad name because of the
behavior of the few, behavior
frequently encouraged by greedy
sheepowners. Awards are made
to be kept by both grazier and
shearer.
Five New Wheats.
“Ben Cubbin”: N.S.W. De-
partment of Agriculture is out to
persuade more wheatgrowers to
try the new varieties, Kendee,
Gabo, Yalta, Celebration and
Charter. According to Dr.
Macindoe, the plant - breeder
responsible for three of them
(Sydney University cerealists
Waterhouse and Watson pro-
duced Kendee and Gabo) and
who also bred Eureka —a wheat
which promised much at first
but seems to have gone off —
these wheats produce a better
bread-flour, and in the northern
N.S.W. wheatbelt millers are
ready to pay from Bd. to 2s. a
bushel premium on them.
Growing premium wheats has
never particularly appealed to
the bulk of farmers, who are
satisfied with a grain that in a
normal season will fill the bags
and return a good f.a.q. sample.
Premium wheats are the pre-
rogative of men in more or less
select situations. And a wheat
ceases to be a premium wheat
when too many grow it. One of
the reasons for the popularity of
Bencubbin—-an “inferior grade”
in Macindoe’s estimation —is
that it stands up to dry seasons
and is a good yielder.
The new wheats got a trial
in the N.S.W. north-west last
season. One who had a chance
to see them said that they were
free of rust in a season when
late rains set up widespread
rust infection, they yielded well
and were full of merit. Eureka,
Bordan and Bencubbin “took
rust” pretty badly, and Eureka
was almost discredited because
of that. All the same, Bordan
won three of the five R.A.S.
field -wheat championships,
Koola another and Celebration
the other. The coming harvest
will have more to report about
the five new varieties.
Mass Food Production.
“Outback”: After visiting the
Central Queensland mass food-
production project, A. M. Blain,
M.H.R. for the N.T., is hopeful
that similar projects will be
undertaken in the 20-, 30- to 40-
inch rainfall belt of the Terri-
tory and Gulf. In view of the
criticism of the Queensland pro-
ject, Blain made an overland
trip from Darwin to Capella to
see for himself. He is now
advocating that J. R, Kem&
Queensland Co-ordinator-
General of Public Works, who
is supervising the scheme, should
be appointed chairman of the
North Australia committee, of
which at present he is only third
member.
The magnitude of the opera-
tions in tractor-ploughing by
'Ti'l have to get a padlock — they're always leaving this
gate open.”
Theiss Bros., said Blain, and the
whole set-up showed the bril-
liance of its conception by Kemp
and the Queensland Govern-
ment, and the wisdom of the
Government in deciding to put
to better use land which had
been denuded of its natural pas-
tures and hardy grasses, largely
by overstocking and droughts,
Peak Downs had been revived
pastorally and was now to pass
through the farming “growing
pains” which the Darling Downs
passed through some years ago.
Blain found subsoil on Peak
Downs moist for four to five
feet below the surface, and the
surface almost a natural seed-
bed, tilled without harrowing—
this effect having been achieved
by continuous overstocking by
sheep. The rich, black soil ex-
amined had a limestone base,
but he was informed that part
of the area boasted a basalt-rock
base. This one property (Peak
Downs) has an area of 92,000
acres, and the ploughing target
for this year is 30,000 acres, of
which 20,000 has been com-
pleted. The property had 104
points rain on May 1, 122 on
June 15, and 215 on July 2,
3, 4 and 5, a total of 441 points,
but prior to this was drought-
stricken. It remains to be seen
how the first year’s plantings
pan out, but Blain says his visit
confirmed his previously pub-
lished statements that millions of
acres in North Queensland and
the Northern Territory—in the
20-, 30-, 40-inch rainfall belt—
were as yet unrecognised as the
grain-sorghum lands they should
be, and for the cultivation of
sorghum, broom millet, cotton
and tobacco without irrigation.
Soldering.
“F.L.”: Most metals, except-
ing certain alloys, will solder
satisfactorily, the main points
being to have the pieces clean,
"a well-tinned soldering-iron and
the right flux. Spirits of salts
does well for most jobs, and
should be broken down to half-
strength with water, and killed
with zinc. If the parts are cor-
roded or dirty, raw spirits will
clean them, but it should be
washed away with water before
soldering. Brass and copper
may be cleaned with fine sand-
paper, and soldered with fluxes
of candle and resin respectively,
Aluminium requires a solder of
its own and a wire brush for
cleaning while soldering, as a
film of oxide forms over the
cleaned part almost immediately
on exposure to the air.
. _ .. . .
Luting Device.
IThap”: Canefarmers who
bring their cane by motor-truck
to tram- or railway-line are in-
terested in a new lifting device
invented by D. Treacy, an en-
gineer, of Mackay (Q.). It con-
sists of two pairs of rollers at
ground-level geared to a wind-
ing-drum with a wire-rope
running to a block suspended
from the overhead transom. The
loaded motor-truck straddles
the tram-line and is stopped
with the rear wheels an the
rollers. Second gear is engaged,
and the rotation of the wheels
easily lifts three to four tons of
cane. The manually-operated
brake on the lift is then applied,
the lorry driven off, a tram-truck
pushed under and the bundle of
cane lowered. It is an idea
which might be worth trying
where other loads have to be
transferred from motor-trucks.
Root Maggot-flies.
“Nubis”: Best known is the
onion-fly—but there are others,
like the bean maggot-fly, which
attacks beans, peas and other
legumes. In appearance they
resemble the house-fly, but are
more elongated and covered in
fine hairs. They lay their eggs
in cracks in the soil close to the
host plants, always choosing
damp soil. They have a liking
for fresh organic manure. The
eggs hatch out in three or four
days, and the maggots attack
and destroy the germinating
seeds). Half or more seeds may
fail to germinate, and of the re-
mainder a further 10 p.c. will
wilt and die when three or four
inches high. To make sure of
the cause, try to dig up those
that failed —many * will have
disappeared altogether, and the
others will be decomposed—
they may even have maggots in
them.
Onion-fly may be controlled
by mixing the seed with finely-
powdered calomel. Moisten the
seed with starch solution —three
teaspoonfuls to i pint of water
—and then mix the seed in the
proportion of 11b. of seed to
Hlb, of calomel. Another
method is to dust the garden
plot with a mixture of calomel
(4 p.c.) and slaked lime (96 p.c.).
Spread to cover the soil com-
pletely along the row and two
inches each side; lib. will do
50 yards. Do it just after ger-
mination and again 10 days
later.
Seed treatment has little effect
on the bean-fly, but dusting is
helpful. A repellent made of
equal parts of tobacco-dust and
slaked lime or napthalene flakes
may prevent egg-laying.
The Young Calf.
“M’hee”: Allow at least one
meal from the mother immedi-
ately after birth, and then house
the youngster in a warm, dry
shed with plenty of straw to
snuggle into. Before birth it’s
carried at a temperature of 100
deg. F. and, under winter con-
ditions in Victoria, is born into

For Medium and
Moderate Sized
Industrial Installations
The Babcock-Detroit Roto-
Stoker is supplied with
either hand or mechanically
operated dumping grate,
and is employed mainly for
medium and moderate
sized industrial installations.
This stoker has been
demonstrated as capable of
handling a very wide range
of fuels, including bitum-
inous, sub-bituminous coals
and lignites, brown coal
and mixtures of coke and
coal.
One of its main advantages is its suitability in plants
where the type or quality of coal delivered varies from
time to time.
As suppliers of all types of firing equipment, whether
for pulverised fuel, oil fuel, other mechanical types of
stokers, or any other known firing method, Babcocks
have the experience necessary to advise on the right
equipment most suitable and economical to your needs.

a temperature averaging about
50 deg. F. For several days it
needs protection against such a
sudden change, and this protec-
tion includes care in feeding.
One of the commonest ail-
ments of the small calf, scours,
is often due to feeding luke-
warm or cold milk which chills
the stomach. Scours can also be
caused by feeding over-rich
milk, which needs to be diluted
with hot water to make it equal
to a 3.5 per cent. test. Don’t
add too much water, however,
or the calf will be underfed. At
two or three weeks the whole-
milk ration can be safely re-
duced from 61b. to 41b. per feed
if skim-milk or gruel is added to
make up for the nutrients dis-
placed.
The Chicken’s First Week.
“J.J.A.”: It’s of paramount
importance. During this period
the chicken has to be closely
watched and carefully attended
from dawn to dark. The
change caused by development
is so rapid that the treatment of
one day is different from the
treatment of the previous day
and of the next. Heat, food,
freedom are three main factors,
all of which alter from day to
day.
After the chicks have hatched
they should be left in the incu-
bator until completely dried off,
otherwise they may become
chilled and get roup. Roup is con-
tagious. Chicks should be trans-
ferred as soon as dry. The brooder
should be at about 90 deg.
F. for the first couple of days,
after which it can.be gradually
cooled. Best guide is a con-
tented chicken. If they huddle
together, chirping loudly, they
are cold. If too hot they will be
spread away from the heat and
will appear- very lazy. It is better
to have the temperature on the
cool side rather than too hot.
The brooder floor needs to be
covered with sand, sawdust, rice
or oat-hulls, etc., clean and dry,
in which the chicks can scratch.
A very small range should be
provided the first day, getting
larger and larger, until they have
full freedom at the end of the
week. By then they should be
hunted out once or twice a day,
otherwise some will never leave
the heat and will starve. On
the first day the water for drink-
ing should have the chill taken
off. After that it doesn’t matter.
One of the best foods is pellets ;
even if only used for one or two
days while the chickens are
learning to eat. Mash is cheaper,
and it is a good idea to break
the chickens into the mash early.
In addition, the chickens should
be given a little crushed char-
coal now and then.
Hints for the Farm.
“C.A.A.”: A useful home-
made scouring-powder can be
made from 21b. of whiting, 21b.
of fine white beach sand and one
large packet of soap-powder.
Mix all together.
“E. 2”: Heavy losses among
hand-reared calves, which often
occur under poor conditions,
could be lessened considerably if
propej- attention were paid to
their quarters. Keep them a
reasonable distance from the
cowyard, providing a small pad-
dock that doesn’t become water-
logged, and a decent shelter-
shed. They must have suitable
cover from bleak and wet
weather and careful feeding if
they are to do better than exist
—and there isn’t much point or
profit in rearing stunted, miser-
able animals.
“Lub”: When growing early
vegetables, remember that slow
soil is heavy, clayey and retains
moisture much longer; quick-
growing soil is light in nature,
preferably sandy to some extent
and takes on warmth earlier.. It
may be improved by enriching
with humus and manure. Nitro-
gen helps .a quick start, fowl-
manure being a good source.
Wood ashes are useful in leaven-
ing the heavier soils, as also is
rotted stable manure. Forcing
with liquid manure in the early
stages should be left off when
the plants are growing strongly,
otherwise they become sappy and
soft.
“L. de F.”: If you live in a
dry area, plant saltbush hedges
for the home poultry. Saltbush
provides green picking through-
out the driest spells, and shade
and shelter from wind. Its nutri-
tion value is as high as lucerne.
Protect until established out of
the birds’ reach, otherwise it
may be eaten right out. The
small-leafed Rhagodia or sheep’s
saltbush has the more succulent
leaf.
“Sudan”: In the African
Sudan outsize snakes some-
times take refuge in the thick
thatch of the roof and have to
be destroyed without damaging
the thatch. To achieve this it is
the custom to burn chillies’ in
the hut, when the snake clears
out. It is said that snakes won’t
enter a thatched roof heated
with chillie smoke. We tried it
after killing a black snake in a
lumber-room to make sure there
were no others. No more snakes
were found, but the least whiff
of chilli smoke set us cough-
ing. It would appear to be an
efficient agent for dislodging
snakes.

Every single
ounce counts if
you’re harvesting
flower seed. It’s a touchy operation.
You know if your equipment can master
this one, it can save many extra pounds
of other types of seeds, such as grasses,
legumes, small grains, peas and beans.
The Allis - Chalmers ALL - CROP
Harvester is the uncanny machine which
is successfully handling thousands of
acres of flower seeds, from sweet peas
to tiny, fine-screen petunia seed.
This same machine has saved 50%
bushels of wheat per acre from a field
which was about to be written off as a
total loss. Dramatic, yes. But just
another job for this versatile once-over
harvester which can switch to any one of
106 different types of crops at the turn
of a lever!
Allis-Chalmers pioneered the ALL-
CROP Harvester—just as it has given
to the farmers of the world many other
important FIRSTS in agricultural
equipment and tractor power.

weeds. “Here, throw this into
the hens while I cut the
marrow.”
“Do they get this all at once?”
“Yes. Spread it along the
floor, and don’t let them out.”
THE child lugged the bucket
I down the section, her blue
hair - ribbon bobbing over a
wilderness of tall, yellow-flower-
ing weeds. Down at a bottom
comer a fowl-house leaned
against the hedge, and along the
back ran the railway-line.
Mrs. Scoones was waiting
when she brought back the
empty bucket. The marrow lay
on the coalbox.
Peep-peep!
A referee’s whistle shrilled
somewhere behind the goods-
shed.
Mrs. Scoones looked across
the line.
Bounded by a homely variety
of back fences and outhouses,
the football-field lay beyond. All
but a few players in, red jerseys
and a handful of spectators were
obscured by the goods-shed and
a rake of trucks.
Then shouting broke out, and,
with a swirl of color, players
came pelting into view. Spec-
tators pressed along the side-
line.
Peep-peep!
SHE saw Mr. Twiss, virtu-
ously white, leap from a
scramble. He landed on one
heel and pointed dramatically to
an offending player. Judgment
in three authoritative stages.
Mrs. Scoones was disturbed.
This was the man from whom
she was withholding her harvest-
festival marrow.
“Goodness, Leonie, you are in
a hurry,” she said, procrastinat-
ing.
Leonie staggered back, her
arms wrapped round the mar-
row as she tested its weight. She
slumped back against the coal-
box and with a winsome smile
explained her haste: “You
haven’t got pups here.”
Peep-peep!
Players had been milling
about in a bottom comer and
Mr. Twiss had swooped again
on an infringement. Up in the
air he went, dispensing justice
with righteous zeal. It was a
spectacle that left Mrs. Scoones
conscience-stricken and miser-
able.
Leonie was making her way
unsteadily round the house.
“I’m off to the Chinaman’s,” she
said, her voice muffled by the
marrow in her arms.
Peep-peep!
Mrs. Scoones relieved her of
her burden at the gate.
“I think you need a glass of
lemonade before you carry that,”
she said.
“It gets heavier -all the time.”
“It’s too heavy for you,
Leonie.”
“No, it’s not,” the child pro-
tested. “I can carry it easy.”
They went into the porch.
Mrs. Scoones used her hat to
fan the dust off a cane table.
Leonie was sighing happily,
biscuit-crumbs plastered round
her mouth, when next Mr.
Twiss’s whistle went.
Peep-peep!
Screened off, Mrs. Scoones
sensed in it now an accusatory
note. All afternoon it would
hound her. And when the har-
vest-festival marrow was sold
what comfort would there be
then?
“I’ll take the marrow now,
Mrs. Scoones.”
From the football-ground
there came a growling that
mounted to a hostile roar. Mr.
Twiss, she imagined wretchedly,
leading a crusade against wrong-
doing.
“I think we’ll just leave the
marrow till another day,
Leonie,” she heard herself sug-
gest.
OVER in the football-field
the uproar subsided and then
broke out again. A pack of
schoolboys raced excitedly down
the road, and heads came pop-
ping up over adjoining fences.
Right in the forefront of it all
was Arnold Scoones. He was
tossing his head recklessly:
“Take Twiss off! Take Twiss
off!”
His mate Harry was working
his lips and spitting across the
rope.
“Out to Josh! ” cried Scoones.
“Out! Get it out!”
Fast dribbling had run play
upfield and the ball shot free
from a scramble.
“Josh! Josh! Josh!”
The ball went out all right.
Out and back. But not to the
lanky, red-headed Josh. A
player wearing yellow and black
moved inside him. Came a hush
of' disbelief and then the ex-
plosion :
“Offside! Waiting offside! ”
Mr. Twiss came puffing across
the paddock, yards back, his
view hopelessly blocked, and the
black-and-yellow man was away,
skimming the ground with feet
that swung him along like flat-
irons.
“Referee, me foot,” Harry was
mumbling to himself.
Challenged, the black-and-
yellow despoiler had kicked a
field goal. The ball slid over
the cross-bar by a margin that
was contemptuous.
“Take Twiss off!” howled
Arnold Scoones amid the hub-
bub.
“Referee, me eye,” mumbled
Harry, whose disgust was apt to
range anatomically.
Down the sideline a drur #en
supporter, loudly dressed and
wearing hornrimmed glasses and
a red rosette, tried to ape Mr.
Twiss’s antics. Throwing him-
self into the air, he was saved
from falling each time by a
youth trailing sheepishly behind.
“Put him on as ref.”
Some of the crowd had taken
up the idea and were trying to
guide their fuddled candidate
into the paddock.
Play was again rushed up-
held and Mr. Twiss puffed des-
perately behind. His face was
fiery red. He ran with a queer,
paunchy erectness.
“Sit down in the middle,”
someone shouted. “They’ll
come back.”
The hubbub rose and fell, and
through it all Mr. Twiss blun-
dered on till the final whistle,
mercilessly abused.
The crowd drifted out and left
a group lingering discontentedly
at the gate, where a fat man
railed about “Twiss having a
few bob on”—a wild charge
that found no support.
“....And you’ve got your
scrum here, say twenty yards
0ut....” Arnold Scoones was
taking advantage of an audience.
He was expounding strategy,
scratching with a twig in the
dust.
“Huh,” said Harry.
Mr. Twiss was coming out to
the gate, marching with a dignity
painfully assumed. He looked
straight ahead. The men at the
gate took a sudden embarrassed
interest in Scoones’s diagrams,
and he passed without a word.
MUMBLING with face-saving
concern about the “poor
’s wind being gone,” they
sauntered down the road behind
him. Arnold Scoones talked
loudly all the way. He puddled
an ink-pencil in saliva in the
palm of his hand and then drew
a diagram on the back. Anyone
who tended to drift away .was
recalled for consultation.
They had no sooner turned
into the main street than Harry
spat in disgust. “Huh.”
Arnold Scoones looked ahead
and swore.
“It’s Scoonsie’s missus,” the
fat man said. “She’s giving a
parcel to Twiss.”
“Parcel, me foot,” said Harry.
“It’s a big marrow.”
Scoones was apologetic. “She
gives him one every year for his
harvest festival.”
“I’d like to see Twiss get
vegetables out of my garden,”
the fat man asserted bitterly. “ ‘I
don’t want your points in,’ I
says to the boss. Til take you
level,’ But I didn’t allow for
a messer like Twiss. I’d like to
catch my wife running out to
him with a vegetable marrow.”
“Mine either.”
Smarting, Arnold Scoones
lengthened his stride until his
footsteps were ringing under the
verandahs.
‘ ‘ L_f EY there,” he called when
1 1 he caught sight of his
wife, who was back weeding
along the picket-fence. “I
thought you was going to sell
that marrow to the Chinaman?”
Mrs, Scoones looked out
through the pickets, frowning.
“You said not to.”
He tossed his head. “I hadn’t
seen the game then.” His tone
was almost whining, as if he’d
been cheated. “Twiss isn’t fit to
run a harvest festival or any-
thing else.”
“Game?” questioned the fat
man. “A blasted farce if ever
I saw one.”
Under the bakery neon-sign
Mr. Twiss’s drunken imitator
was giving a last weary display.
“He’d have got no marrow if
I’d been back home,” Arnold
Scoones was declaring.
“It wasn’t just Mr. Twiss I
was giving to,” Mrs. Scoones
said, smiling and not caring who
saw her broken tooth.
She wore her floppy white hat
like a halo. Arnold Scoones
was confounded —irrevocably.
And she was right with God and
Mr. Twiss.

Muscovite Merriment.
exclaimed Joe, as Molly came
in. “A rare piece of pure Com-
munist wit, this.” He began
reading from the paper. “‘A
collectivised plumber of Omsk
was heating his soldering-iron
over one of the latest stream-
lined sperm-oil lamps, the pride
of Soviet scientific achievement.
“What does the smoke from this
lamp remind you of. Comrade?”
he asked his happy fellow-
worker. “I don’t know —what?”
asked the other. “Why, the
hopeless struggle of the Western
plutocracies to match the mag-
nificent industrial achievement
of the mighty Soviet, of course,”
answered the plumber.’ ”
With no little difficulty Molo-
tov succeeded in unscowling his
face, and as at last he savored
the full import of this rollicking
piece of fun, he took his cue
from the Fiihrer and started
chuckling. He was still making
queer noises when Joe inter-
rupted.
“Here’s a better one,” he said.
“Listen to this: ‘A Red Army
bullock-breaker had just handed
a docile beast over to an artillery
unit. “Why is a Red Army
bullock like a windy day?” he
asked the unit’s political com-
missar. The commissar failed
to see the joke and sought en-
lightenment. “Because in capi-
talist countries the workers’ wills
are crushed and Imperialism is
rampant,” replied the bullock-
breaker.’ ”
At the brilliant originality of
this uproarious sally Joe and
Molly held their sides, and Joe
burst into the famous soprano
guffaw he reserves for only the
very best Soviet brand of humor.
Wiping away the tears that
were streaming down his face,
Joe pointed to a par. a little
further down and went into
shrieks. He rolled around help-
lessly for at least a minute and
then he gasped it out so that his
Foreign Minister could appreci-
ate it.
“ ‘A chimney-sweep, his face
still black from the job he had
just finished, met another sweep
with a clean face who was just
on his way to a job.
“ ‘ “Why is a sweep walking
down the Nevsky Prospekt like
a droshky with one wheel off?”
the black-faced sweep asked the
clean-faced one. The latter had
no idea. “Why,” said the black-
faced sweep, “because the Eng-
lish and Americans in Berlin are
plotting to split Germany in two
and trying to provoke the Soviet
into a new war so that Wall-
street may make bigger pro-

At this almost perfect example

■As Molotov took off his
boots and entered the sanc-
tum of sanctums he saw
that the Red Fuhrer was shaking
silently. In front of Joe was a
copy of “Crocodile,” the first

sky, who had been promoted to
the post from his previous job
as a Stakhanovite taster in an
offal factory.
“Listen to this, Comrade,’

heads of the unhumorous West-
ern nations, Molly staggered
and held his sides and Joe was
set in a roar.
As the strange sounds floated
out to them the guards just
outside the door looked anxiously
at each other. They would have
gone in to see what was wrong
only they knew that if they had
made an attempt to open the
door they would be mown down
by the tommy-guns which they
were aware the secret-police
always had trained on them.
Meanwhile the Fiihrer was
lapping up the comics. “Listen
to this screaming jokeski. Com-
rade,” he said to Molly. “‘A

factory met a comrade whose
job it was to wash out the iron
vodka-bottles. “Why does a hen

asked. Quick as a flash the
other replied: “Because the
happy workers of the mighty
Soviet Union feel pity for the
downtrodden slaves of the capi-
talistic democracies who are
driven to their benches with
whips and shot like dogs if they
leave them even for a
minute!”’”
Joe and Molly clung to each
other and shrieked anew at this
wonderful example of side-
splitting Communist humor. It
was almost five minutes before
they regained some measure of
composure, and even then Joe’s
handlebar mo was still oscillat-
ing violently with half-suppressed
merriment.
The Fiihrer flicked over the
page, and what he saw caused
his brows to come together in
their customary frown.
Over three columns was a
joke-block depicting a huge
trailer crawling along a tor-
turous road around a mountain.
On the outside edge, trying to
get past the trailer, its wheels
almost over the drop of 1000 ft.,
was a baby car. The diiyer or
the trailer was saying: Here,
do y* want all the Blasted road
to yourself?”
Joe looked at it sternly and
turned to Molotov. “I can t see
anything funny in that,” he said
acidly. “It is obviously Western
humor, if you can call it that.
You can see it is not by a Soviet
artist —the trailer looks too much
like a trailer. The editor has
lifted this from a Western
paper.”
The next day M. Gloumsky
had an urgent appointment with
a brick wall, and the search had
begun for a new editor of
“Crocodile.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
per line; all others per line.
Trees
A Forestry conference in Australia in
1920 decided that a maximum of
19,500,000 acres (approximately 30,500
sq. miles) could be set aside permanently
as State forests. It was claimed that this
area, if properly planted to capacity and
scientifically milled, could keep a nation
of up to 22,500,000 people in timber
Already 18,800,000 acres, or 97 per cent
of the recommended total, has been se
aside. Though it isn’t by any means al
first-class timber-land, the Forestry
authorities are doing their best to make
it so, especially in the planting of badly-
needed softwoods. The eye-gouging days
when the glorious red-cedar and white-
beech were ripped out are gone.
But it is not so much from a timber
as from an erosion viewpoint that tree-
destruction has become a national menace
That is nowhere more obvious than on
the north coast of N. S. Wales.
There, destruction of trees, the rool
cause of erosion, is still a common anc
lightly-regarded crime. The practice ol
“burning the brushing”—putting a fire
through felled scrub left to dry for a few
months —is still prevalent, particularly in
the hilly banana country. It provides
fine pyrotechnics, and helps to ensure a
good first crop, but also helps to burn a
hole in the country’s future. Plenty of
scope, too, is afforded the ringbarker.
There must be scores of thousands of
ringbarked trees between the Hunter and
the Tweed—a man on his own freehold
ground can ring and burn nearly as he
wishes.
This exemption .of freehold from
control is a glaring loophole in the State’s
forestry and tree-protection laws. N. S.
Wales’s 6,500,000 acres of State forests
and timber reserves are well conducted,
with emphasis on replanting and re-
generation. There is some degree of
control over timber on leasehold. But
upon freehold the tree-growth is wide
open to the owner’s axe. One-quarter of
the entire area of N. S. Wales is in one
way or another freehold property/-
Australian conditions make tree-pro-
tection even more important than the
rights of the freeholder. Some form of
control should, where necessary, be ex-
tended to include trees on alienated land.
In the drier parts of the continent,
every form of tree- and shrub-growth
has value as a soil-holder. The wheat-
farming soldier-settlers of the Victorian
Mallee learned that lesson to their cost.
There it is a question of holding the soil
against the desert rather than of timber.
The plan, already under way, to plant up
the 15in.-20in. rainfall belt with smaller
tree-growth thereby acquires a national
urgency. It should be extended and
hastened as much as possible.
The country must become acutely tree-
conscious. Plant-roots, and tree-roots in
particular, are the only things holding
this dry, windswept old continent to-
gether.—K. A. S. (N.S.W.).
Parks and Reserves
It is time the appropriate State
authorities did something about setting
aside and developing some scenic areas
of Victoria as national parks on the lines
of Yellowstone and Yosemite Valley in
the U.S.A. The Grampians and Victoria
Ranges could well receive attention. All
of the eastern and northern slopes and
portion of the western slopes are being
extensively developed by the Water and
Forest Commissions as water-catchment
and forest reserves.
Those areas supply all of the Wimmera
and Mallee and a large part of the
Western District with water and all of
those districts with timber, both hard-
and softwoods. However, the Forests
Commission has indicated that the
southern slopes of the ranges possess no
timber of commercial value and are not
required for reafforestation as potential
water-catchment areas. The commission
would view favorably their dedication as
a national park. That this has not already
been done probably reflects the deplor-
able apathy of Australians to their fine
natural resources.— Plain Australian
(Vic.).
Residents in the near-Melbourne “hills”
are complaining of the increasing de-
struction of plant-life in the forests by
vandals and thieves. About Healesville
and the Dandenongs gum-shaded fern
gullies which, a decade ago, were graced
by native flora and stately tree-ferns have
today been reduced to barren ground and
tree-trunks. Most of the birds have
sought other feeding- and nesting-grounds,
and the pools in the cascading streamlets
—once thick with maidenhair fern —are
silting-up. •
Melbourne has only a few natural
scenic attractions within easy reach, and
these fern-gullies, peculiar to the Vic-
torian bush, are, or were, one of them.
Their preservation should not be left to
well-meaning local authorities. It is a
State Government matter. The gullies
should be netted completely in before it
is too late, so they will reafforest them-
selves.—Horseless Horseman (Vic.),
The Snowy Water
“Dee” (B. 25/8/’4B) suggests a com-
mission with adequate power to make
decisions and give effect to them in
matters of water-conservation, with par-
ticular reference to the Snowy waters.
Why set up another commission when we
could draw experts from State irrigation
and electricity authorities whose recom-
mendations would be based on economic
facts, while final decisions would be made
by the Commonwealth and the three
States who are parties to the Murray
Waters Agreement?
“Dee” has not gone very far into the
matter if he thinks there is no funda-
mental difference between the Murray
and the ’Bidgee. Here are some figures
for “Stage 1”;
Murray. Murrumbidgee.
Capital cost .. £44.5 million £14.4 million
Power generated .. 405,000 k.w. 41,400 k.w.
Capitalised value of
net return ~ £42.6 million £0.6 million
The Murray certainly does cost more,
but what does that matter when it almost
pays for itself?
And if that evidence does not overcome
the inter-State wrangling which is at
present delaying the work, for another
£4 million the water can be turned back
from the Murray to the ’Bidgee! —W. D.
(Vic.).
New States
Recent discussions about new States
envisage States of substantial area —
three in Queensland, three or four
in N. S. Wales and so forth. The old
idea was for a larger number of small
States—some proposals were for 30 or
40, governed by provincial councils on
an enlarged municipal basis.
The over-small new State can defeat its
purpose, as can the over-large. Divisions
based on population, even on economic
unities, can be misleading. A population
of 200,000 has been suggested, but this
could be spread raggedly over a wide and
otherwise unassimilable area. If popu-
lation is to be a determinant, then poten-
tial population must be considered. It
is certain that the population of a given
“I bet you'd be more interested if it Was the blonde next door!"
area would increase under the stimulus
of more-localised government and direc-
tion.
Nor is it enough to take like industries
and construct a new State on that basis
—all the main rural industries are widely
scattered around Australia. For instance,
the North and South Coasts of N. S. Wales
are both primarily dairying districts, and
some of the mid-western towns like
Orange have important local dairying in-
dustries. But no “dairy State” could be
constructed on that basis.
The soundest approach is through a
combination of population-potential,
economic unity, and geographical logic.
There are certain areas which almost
define themselves as “natural” new States,
and it is towards the selection and defi-
nition of these “natural” areas that in-
telligent new-State thinking will direct
itself. For instance, the North Coast of
N. S. Wales, bounded by the Pacific, the
Macpherson Ranges, the Dividing Range
and a point south at Coff’s Harbor, or
down to Kempsey, is a “natural” area.
It has a sizeable population, which will
increase, a naturally integrated economy,
a flow of rivers and a run of railways
which shape towards as logical a pattern
as Australia can provide.
The revived New England movement
has already overreached itself by includ-
ing areas of the tablelands which are out-
side the “natural” area of the coast.
Similarly the movement in southern
N. S. Wales to include the South Coast
with a wide sweep into Victoria includ-
ing Sale is running against natural logic.
A new State embracing the South Coast
and perhaps reaching down to Orbost
seems more reasonable.
The essential thing is to find natural
boundaries. Historically, mountain
ranges are obvious dividing lines, and it is
not accidental that many countries in
other continents are separated by
mountain ranges—Central Europe, Chile-
Argentina, India-China are examples. It
is equally self-evident that rivers as divid-
ing lines are absurd—our own Murray is
the supreme example. Boundaries drawn
by running a pencil and ruler across a
map are, of course, merely primitive.
Even at this early stage, enthusiastic
new Staters would save themselves many
headaches if they kept firmly in mind
the political unities which, in their field,
are as important as the dramatic unities
are to a playwright.— Dee (N.S.W.).
Despite the clamor for a new State for
North Queensland, the sentiments of
members of the Thuringowa Shire
Council are pessimistic. The councillors
drew attention to the fact that a new
State would mean new and elaborate
Governmental buildings and the host of
Government departments. They pointed
out that this initial cost would have to
be borne by the already overburdened
taxpayer.
These councillors should know what
they are talking about if a lifetime in
North Queensland can teach them any-
thing. The chairman is 83 and four of
his councilors are over 70, while the
youngster of the council is in his middle
forties.
All of them are hard-working country
men, scornful of modern city life and
convinced that there is no country like
North Queensland. —A. W. R. (Q.).
From what I have seen and heard on
the Far North Coast of N. S. Wales,
the New-State movement will come to
nothing. The only time I have heard it
mentioned was when I introduced it into
the conversation. Even then, after a few
trite remarks, the subject was quickly
dropped.
Far more important, judging from the
amount of talk, are the effect of floods
on current cream cheques, the expected
weather for next Saturday’s football, the
chances of getting a new car in the near
future, and, of course, Saturday’s races.
Reason? To the average man the
“curse of control from distant Sydney”
means nothing. He knows that Brisbane
folk who can scrounge petrol come to
Murwillumbah and Lismore to shop for
goods unobtainable in the Queensland
capital. He hears tourists say that our
stores have better stocks than Sydney
shops. He does not visit the capitals to
see that this happy state is not really
true —it applies to a very limited list of
articles.
Until the average voter can be made
to realise the need for a break from
Sydney, the new State can never happen.
Incidentally, in all the discussion on
new States, the fact that northern N. S.
Wales is very closely linked with Brisbane
seems to have been overlooked. Per-
haps a better scheme would be a State
running from, say, Maryborough in the
north to Grafton in the south, extending
to the present boundaries in the west.
That would provide a reasonably compact
State with very little variation of interests
and problems.—T. P. V. (N.S.W.).
Building Timber
Cypress pine is unequalled for tough
and decorative flooring. It cheapest
of all flooring selling today; but you’ve
a better chance of winning a lottery than
of buying 1000 ft. of cypress.
Some timber merchafits blame the rail-
ways for the scarcity, at the same time
offering to supply hardwood, which
also needs railway transport. Other
merchants state openly that cypfess sup-
plies are being held until the price is
increased.
Six weeks ago I ordered cypress floor-
ing -for two cottages. Yesterday I re-
ceived a letter stating that cypress was
unavailable and offering hardwood or
“Baltic pine” instead. The hardwood
was 90s, per 100 ft. and Baltic pine
131 s. 6d.
Baltic is very knotty, like cypress, but
it is soft, and under hard use the soft
timber wears away, leaving the knots pro-
jecting like organ-stops. It is hard to
understand why Baltic is brought from
Europe when, if trucks were provided,
millions of feet of cypress could be made
available to home-builders at half the
cost— Pongo (N.S.W.),
T.B.
The Marion Council (S.A.) lately
passed a resolution objecting to the
erection of a new sanatorium for t.b.
patients at Bedford Park. A sanatorium
has been on the site for 32 years. It is
surrounded by its own 350 acres of graz-
ing and agricultural land. Similar pro-
perties adjoin it, so that the nearest resi-
dence is half a mile away, and the nearest
cluster of houses one mile. Yet the coun-
cillors fear a nevv building will spread
infection in the district! These notions
are not confined to people of one State
or one class; they are universal.
The Director-General of Medical Ser-
vices pointed out that risk of infection is
minimised. Even with the close contact
by nursing staff only three have been
known to contact t.b. Further evidence
is the way in which wives and relatives
remain free of the complaint. Those
few infections that do arise usually occur
before the disease is recognised.
It is estimated that one in four adults
have a trace of the tubercle bacilli in their
system. The danger lies not in the
initial contact with the germ, but in the
person’s state of health. An intensive
publicity campaign will enable people to
regard t.b. sensibly, instead of avoiding
the subject because of fear and ignor-
ance. — Hadit (S.A.).
Road Safety *
The N. S. Wales Transport Minister has
suggested that all car-drivers be re-
examined every 12 months. What a brain-
wave! Not only would thousands of
drivers lose a day’s work, or more, wait-
ing to be re-examined, but there would
have to be an army of public servants to
examine drivers and issue licences.
Nor would this procedure lessen acci-
dents. Drivers involved in serious acci-
dents are generally men and women cap-
able of passing the most severe driving
test. But give them a fast car, a few
beers and the feeling that there are no
cops about, and they become reckless
menaces.
The best system would be to keep a
record of drivers’ performances, and deal
severely with those who are frequently
involved in traffic accidents and breaches.
It has also been suggested that drivers
should be subjected to regular medical
examination. Here again it will be found
that most drivers who are involved in
accidents could pass any medical exami-
nation. Drivers who suffer from physical
disability are doubly careful. A physi-
cally perfect driver can be involved in
frequent accidents, break all the rules,
yet get his licence renewed without any
bother year after year. If a driver suf-
fering from some disability is involved in
an accident, his licence is apt to be re-
viewed and he will be put to a lot of
bother.—W. P. T. (N.S.W.),
The Victorian Government has taken
a firm stand on the question of road
hoardings (B. 1/9/’4B). It has decided
that all are to come down and no more
will be erected. The decision was accom-
panied by a statement to the effect that a
driver’s eyes should be on the road ahead
of him and nowhere else. The necessary
legislation has been promised at an early
date. The same Government has also
decreed that left-hand drive motor
vehicles are illegal. No new ones will
be permitted, and all present ones are to
be converted to right-hand as soon as
possible. Both measures are sound. —
R.G.G. (Vic.).


were put ahead. The other’s cables
slackened; she had moved. Similarly,
stern way tautened them. The Italian was
afloat. Her cables were slipped and the
tow started for Karachi. After a few
miles, however, Hilda settled ominously,
and before she could founder she was
beached in Chahbar Bay. Signals brought
a powerful tug, which, after temporarily
repairing the tow, hauled it to Karachi,
Yarra arriving shortly after towing an-
other prize, the Barbara.
A few months later, in Bomb Alley,
Yarra’s crew wished themselves back in
the Gulf. For two months, almost con-
stantly at sea, she fought her way along
the Alexandria - Tobruk ferry - run,
bombed, dive-bombed and washed and
shaken by hammering near-misses. But
her time was not yet; and end of 1941
found her clearing the Mediterranean,
bound for Java. She arrived in Batavia
on January 11, 1942.
Empress of Asia
The crew didn’t have to wait long for
action. Next month the sloop was escort-
ing troop-crowded Empress of Asia to her
berth in Singapore Roads when a covey
of Jap dive-bombers fell out of the sky
upon her. The trooper in those confined
waters offered a target like a paddock. In
a few minutes direct hits along her length
had her blazing. With boats splintered
or burning things looked grim for the
men packed aboard, until Yarra, half
her crew fighting guns and the rest
standing-by with lines and fenders, slid
her length in under a rain of burning
debris and rasped to rest beside her.
Soldiers squeezed out of portholes on
to her decks, slid down ropes and boat
lifelines, or fell into the sea and were
fished out. At last, with 1800 troops
crammed aboard, her guns still firing, the
little ship broke free and zigzagged for
Singapore’s wharves. Empress of Asia
was a total loss.
This excellent piece of seamanship was
a fitting “evolution completed” lor her
captain. He left the ship a week later,
and Lt.-Cdr. R. W. Rankin, R.A.N.,
assumed command. Yarra was kept busy
escorting round the East Indies, until, on
February 27, she sailed from Batavia as one
of an escort for five merchantmen bound
for Tjilatjap, on Java’s southern coast.
Sloop v. Squadron
At this stage the Indies’ position was
tense. Singapore was taken, the Allies
were retreating through Java and
Sumatra, and naval dispositions which
were to end in the sinking of Perth and
three Allied cruisers had begun. Jap
aircraft and warships were operating
freely and widely around the islands, and
shortly after leaving Batavia enemy
bombers caught the seven-knot convoy.
For 11 hours all ships were targets for
high- and low-level attacks. Yarra’s guns
shot five planes into the sea, and, contact-
ing an echo on her asdic, she swung from
the convoy and beat the life out of a sub-
marine with depth-charges.
Enemy bombing, though inaccurate,
kept guns’ crews closed up continuously,
and Tjilatjap was approached with relief.
About to enter, however, Yarra was
ordered from shore to continue steaming,
as powerful Jap forces were approaching
the harbor.
The convoy split, that unit under Yarra
—two merchantmen and a small motor-
minesweeper—heading south for Aus-
tralia at its full speed. On March 3 Yarra
picked up 40 officers and men from a de-
stroyed Dutch ship : it was a bad augury.
Next day hands went to dawn action-
stations, and, with nothing in sight, fell
out at 0630. Five minutes later, as the
ship’s company sat down to breakfast, the
masthead lookout sweeping astern —she
carried in those early days no radar —
sighted half a dozen masts jutting above
the horizon. These resolved swiftly into
the hulls of three heavy cruisers, their
spearhead of destroyers low-hung beneath
bow-waves of their utmost power. The
little sloop, her tiny guns the convoy’s
sole protection, closed up again and pre-
pared to fight.
Guard-rails were lowered, hoses run
above and between decks, watertight bulk-
heads closed and the engine-room ordered
to make smoke. Funnel streaming, Yarra
coursed across the convoy’s line of re-
treat, each ship stoking for its life behind
the screen.
The enemy opened fire almost imme-
diately, long-range “finding” shots which
fell wide. Her smokescreen laid, Yarra
altered course 90 degrees and steamed
straight for the Japanese squadron.
Another “Revenge”
There followed a brutal pounding, the
single redeeming feature of which was
the plain guts which ensured its continu-
ance. Tennyson’s ballad on Grenville’s
Revenge could in some ways be Yarra's
• epitaph.
With the range closing at 40 knots the
Japanese shells fell closer, until a
salvo exploded in Yarra’s sickbay.
Almost at once another smashed the
transmitting station to a tangle of
mechanism and torn wires. This was the
gunnery nerve-centre, and its loss meant
that guns would be reduced to laying and
training through telescopes, without the
advantage of mathematical data —range,
deflection, and so on —which instruments
in the T.S. had calculated for them.
The next shell blew the muzzle off the
after gun. The sloop’s paper-thin bridge
caught a salvo which wrecked steering-
control. The engine-room repair-party
got to work, and in a few minutes she was
steering from the tiller-flat aft, above the
rudder.
The little ship was twisting desperately
under a concentrated fire from over a
score of Sin. guns. Continuously hit, she
staggered on to close the range, her own
salvos falling short of the enemy cruisers,
the sea around her convulsed with white
pillars and patterned with circles of foam.
The mainmast sheared off and fell in
a tangle of rigging over the side, with
trailing wires threatening to foul her
screws. All boats were smashed. Then
a salvo struck the bridge with a force that
seemed to halt the ship abruptly. It was
followed almost immediately by another
in the engine-room. Light and power
failed. Her last effort was to try and ram
a destroyer closing in for a torpedo kill,
but the waterlogged hull was too heavy
to answer its rudder.
At 0650 the captain ordered abandon
ship. Thirty-three men got away on carley
rafts and floating spars. Yarra was stopped
how, listing heavily and burning. Half a
whaler hung from the davits, the bridge
spilled in a mess of twisted steel over B
gun-deck and oil flowed from her belly.
Men on rafts cheered when a Jap
cruiser-borne aircraft missed with bombs.
A light stuttered from an enemy
cruiser’s bridge, and in obedience two
destroyers closed in to finish her. Even
at that range, her thin hull shuddering at
each impact, it was two hours before she
sank—at 0900.
The remainder of the Jap squadron had
in the meantime caught the fleeing
convoy; every ship was sunk.
No attempt was made to molest or
rescue men in the water, some of
whom disappeared. The enemy ships
vanished to the n.-w. and the sur-
vivors were left alone on an empty sea.
They had two gallons of water on each
raft and one tin of biscuits caught float-
ing past. There were no officers saved.
A ration of one biscuit and one tea-
spoon of water was agreed to and adhered
to until Saturday, March 7, three days
after Yarra sank. This day, shifting posi-
tion in one raft in a choppy sea, all the
water and biscuits were lost. Later the
same morning a stoker, weakened by
pain and hunger, fell from his raft. Five
men immediately dived to help him, and,
though they managed to drag him to the
raft, were too weak to haul him inboard.
He died while they were trying.
When it seemed another few hours
would finish the 13 men left alive, Dutch
submarine K 2 surfaced near by. Almost
dead with hunger and fatigue, the 13 were
taken aboard —starved, pathetic and faces
overgrown with bristles. They were
picked up 360 miles south of Java, after
105 hours in the water. Ten days later
the survivors of a very gallant ship’s
company were safe in Colombo.
Darwin
“Lim-Limbu’s” sorry tale of New
Guinea (B. 28/7/’4B) applies just as
pointedly to Darwin. For almost three
years the replanners of Darwin have been
at work, acres of paper have been covered
with plans and computations, dozens of
surveyors have surveyed and resurveyed
the blocks and streets for the new town,
and the result has been nothing but stag-
nation and confusion.
Here are a few samples of plans for
the new Darwin: “Every house built be-
fore the war, damaged, or perfect, must
come down” ; “only damaged buildings
will be removed ; anything repairable will
be repaired, and left standing”; “the
present shopping centre will be moved
north of Daly-street”; “the shopping
centre is to be left intact; a new shopping
centre will be allotted north of Daly-
street” ; “all Darwin churches must be
moved to new sites, their freehold sites
must be relinquished and they must be
erected on leases” ; “the churches remain
in situ, with larger areas allotted to them
for future expansion.” And so forth.
Meanwhile Darwin residents are living
in tumbledown places and planning for
the day when definite blocks will be
allotted them, and they can begin building
permanent homes. Others are housed in
Sidney Williams huts, and don’t know
whether to improve their homes or not —
they don’t know how long they will be
allowed to live in them.
Temporary buildings are going up for
Government departments. A set of tem-
porary cells of concrete and of arc mesh
was built at the rear of the police-station,
also temporary. A temporary garage to
hold eight cars has lately been built of
second-hand timber and used iron beside
the cells. The garage cost over £2OOO,
a better building of similar size was put
up as a private home at a cost of £5OO.
Enough money has been spent on tem-
porary buildings in Darwin to build per-
manent homes for every resident of the
town; but the powers still play about
with their paper-plans, rulers, tape-
measures and visions. The residents are
settling down to a scrubby, disillusioned
existence in a dreary slum setting. Their
town could and should be the most
beautiful city in Australia, for its natural
surroundings are ideal for homebuilding.
Today it is nothing but a sink for the tax-
payers’ money.— Darwinite (N.T.).
Southey and Macaulay
Southey was prone to prejudice. His
political writings contain a good deal of
it. Nor are they lacking in shortsighted-
ness and some absurdity. His opponents
were thus provided with plenty of
material for satire such as Macaulay in-
dulged in when reviewing Southey s
Colloquies of Society (B. 1/9/’4B).
Still, Southey’s attitude to social and
economic problems was far from falla-
cious. Today some of his opinions enjoy
general endorsement. He held, for in-
stance, that there should be a minimum
living standard sufficient to enable the
poorest to live in decency, and that child
labor —then grossly exploited —should be
prohibited. His writings inspired the
social reformer Lord Shaftesbury. Dis-
raeli’s social philosophy, which forms the
basis of the social programme of the
modern British Conservative party, was
also influenced by them.
Macaulay, on the other hand, was
essentially a man of his time. His was
the complacent current Liberal creed
that the State should refrain from inter-
ference with economic life. The well-
being of the community would be best
furthered by allowing full scope to “the
free play of economic forces, and the
beneficent automatism of free enterprise”
as the main modern spokesman of this
school (Von Mises) puts it.
The laissez-faire school had the fullest
opportunity in Britain to prove the
value of its doctrines. Their application
caused so many evils that Parliament had
to introduce pro-
gressive modifica-
tions, The system’s
worst effects were
seen in the Irish
potato famine of
1846, the severity of
which was greatly ac-
centuated by pedantic
regard for laissez-
faire shibboleths.
Mankind seems
never fated to choose,
for long, the happy
mean. The reaction
from the results of
laissez-faire indivi-
dualism has been
carried so far that
the modern world is
threatened with the evil of complete
regimentation. But one extreme does
not justify another. Unfettered capi-
talism is as fruitful of ill as socialism.
'Hie economic history of the past
century contains adequate proof of
that.— Morris the Tinker (N.S.W.).
Aircraft Accidents
It is unlikely that anything useful will
be learned from the inquiry into the
recent DC3 disaster in N. S. Wales be-
cause no radio messages were received
from the pilot after he got into difficulties. •
Presumably the pilot did not use his
radio because he was too busy controlling #
the aircraft’s movement, even though he
was desperately in need of guidance. The
co-pilot would have been busy working
out their position.
In good weather messages can be ex-
changed between aircraft and ground
stations in a few seconds, and the pilot
and co-pilot can cope with the radio as
well as their flying. In bad weather,
especially in electric storms, it is different.
Fifteen minutes may be taken getting
through one message because of bad re-
ception. At such times a separate radio-
operator is needed.
DC3 aircraft used for military flying
carried a radio-operator, and in many
crises the messages that this crew-member
got through enabled the pilot to reach
"Cant We go to the pictures? I'm getting tired."
safety. On one occasion persistent radio-
operating caused the flares at Mary-
borough aerodrome to be lit, and these
undoubtedly saved the aircraft, as the
pilot was hopelessly lost.
In the light of the recent disaster the
Civil Aviation Department should con-
sider again what complement of crew is
needed to handle a DC3 when it strikes
bad weather. — Minto (Q.).
Victorian State Orchestra
The Hollway Government’s stated in-
tention to finance a State orchestra has
started the usual controversy as to who is
to be the conductor. There are the usual
assertions from concertgoers that no
local conductor could possibly fill the
bill, there being none comparable with
the overseas conductors.
It is probably the same old snobbery
which manifested itself in the case of the
Spivakovskys. When they were eminent
young virtuosi from overseas they played
to packed houses. After they had lived
a few years in Melbourne as teachers they
gave a concert at the Town Hall and
fewer than 400 music-lovers attended,
though there was no reason to suppose
they weren’t playing better than on
their first arrival.
It used to be the fashion to sniff at
Professor Heinze, who couldn’t possibly
be any good, having been born in Shep-
parton, and having had no overseas ex-
perience except study under famous
teachers in London, Paris and Berlin,
which studies were interrupted for five
years when he was a gunner in World
War I.
Then Heinze went abroad and was
found good enough to be engaged as a
conductor of symphonic orchestras in
London, Paris, Helsingfors, Budapest,
Zurich, Berlin and Canadian cities. The
same music-lovers now speak quite highly
of him.—F. S. (Vic.).
Root of the Matter
That Wallaroo (S.A.) wheat distillery,
which cost about £500,000 to build during
the war to please some grand whim of
Pollard’s predecessor, Scully, and never
handled a grain of wheat, is to be taken
over by an English company for the pro-
duction of plastic products. The dis-
tillery at Cowra (N.S.W.) is to house a
power-plant; that, at Warracknabeal
(Vic.), like the wool-floor at Moree, re-
mains sounding and empty. —B. M. (S.A.).
Dedman got back from the North full
of a discovery that there was “consider-
able room for expansion of beef produc-
tion” up there. As aids to expansion he
suggests satisfactory price agreements,
adequate transport, improved stock-routes
and “station improvements by way of
water, fencing and cattle management.”
However, he is satisfied that “Govern-
ment action alone will not achieve the
desired result.” Since when has his
Government taken any “action” for and
on behalf of northern cattlemen? —
S C. S. (N.T.).
All the crazy notions about shorter
hours are not confined to Australian
unions. 'The N.Z. Dairy Factories Em-
ployees’ Union was asking the conciliators
for a 35-hour week at the beginning of
this month, along with wage increases
of up to 41s, 3d. for the truncated period.
The plea was that it would stop men leav-
ing the dairy factories for other work, but
since the “other work” is 40 hours the
argument seemed to be weak somewhere.
