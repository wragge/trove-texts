Bastard Monroeism.
The perfectly absurd way in which the
Government of Victoria—supported as well
by the Australasian sentiment of the baser
and more foolishly unthinking kind, as by
that so blatantly expressed by British jingo
journalism—is seeking to apply a sort o f
bastard Monroeism in Polynesia, would b e
amusing enough to watch were it not so
patently fraught with consequences of an
exceedingly mischievous and dangerous
character. We use the expression “bastard
MONROEisaf” for this reason: the doctrine
of James Monroe was a sensible, a sober, a
feasible doctrine. It was promulgated by
the head of a State that had succeeded in
consolidating its own possessions by the
purchase from France of the great tract of
Louisiana and acquisition (by cession from
Spain) of the peninsula of Florida, and was
rejoicing in the glorious spectacle of its
southern sister States throwing off the in.
tolerable yoke of Spanish despotism, and
introducing the garb of republican freedom.
At such a time, and under such condition g
as those connected with the establishment
of republicanism in American territories
that had been wrested from tyranny, there
was nothing inconsistent, nothing savouring
of “spread-eagle-ism,” in the President of
the elder American Republic promulgating,
as it were officially, the sentiment of
“ Americafor the Americans,” and publicly
advancing the reasonable doctrine that no
European power has any right whatsoever
to interfere in the affairs of continental
America, and that the introduction of the
old world political systems to any part
thereof would be dangerous to the welfare
of the United States. “ America for the
Americans,” as employed by Monroe, was a
sentiment in no way implying a jealous ex-
clusion of European immigration; it simply
was meant by him to affirm a deliberate
resolution to keep clear of the baneful influ.
ences and disastrous consequences of the
application of monarchical and aristocratic
principles, and, as so employed, was surely
the simple, honest expression of an intrinsi-
cally healthy and patriotic republicanism
beginning to be conscious and proud of its
power.
r • • •
Australia for the Australians, as a poli-
tical expression is equally healthy and
patriotic, so long as it covers no more than
the idea, analogous to that of Monroe’s, that
in their own Continent Australians are in
duty bound to resent to their uttermost and
if need be to die to maintain the doctrine
that no foreign power possesses any right
whatsoever to interfere in their affairs, and
that the introduction into any part thereof
of any institution savoring of the old worlds
political systems, with their provisions for
privileged castes, would be dangerous to the
welfare of the Australian People. To say
this wculd not be to advocate and preach
anything resembling “spread-eagleism.”
But that sentiment which the insane jingos
of Australia, egged on by the still insaner
jingos of the mother country, are advocating
and preching ad nauseam, is “ spread-
eagleism” of a monstrous type. With all
the greediness and snappishness of the pro-
verbial dog in the manger, Australia (as
represented by the before mentioned insane
jingos) clamours for the wholesale annexa-
tion of the Polynesian Archipelago, in (her
interests, and makes that demand with work
undone lying to her hand to do. With
population and resources not yet adequate
to the task of properly subduing and set-
tling the lands on even the foreshores of he/-
own proper area, Australia (represented by
the Service stamp of politician) wildly shrieks
for more territory, in the interests of the
commercial missionary.
• • i
Let it be granted, as we do most freely,
that it would be most objectionable to have
this continent inundated with French recidi-
vists, and that Australian politicians are
perfectly in the right in strenuously en-
deavouring to prevent such rascality from
contaminating their country, yet what but
absolutely fatuous unreason can there be in
the method now being pursued by Service
and his following in the hope of con-
vincing a great Power like the French Re-
public that her Polynesian convict system
must be put down,; because they hold that it
is fraught with moral danger to Australasia;?
Had a different tone than that of insulting
Podsnappery been taken by the Service
crowd; had the economic mistake of convict
transportation been logically and courte-
ously pointed out to the French Govern-
ment—and Australian evidence as to trans-
portation being an economic mistake is very
convincing when properly stated—we firmly
believe that France would have been dis_
posed to listen—to reason. But, no! either
a tone of ridiculous bluster, or one of im-
pertinent advice (such as Murray Smith’s
cool suggestion to shunt all the recidivists
off to Cayenne, and so save Australian, at
the expense of American and West Indian,
morals) has been adopted, leaving to France
scarce any option but to continue in her
course—a course, by the bye, she has a per-
feet right to adopt without consulting any-
body—if only to preserve her self-respect.
Ferry is undoubtedly correct in his asser-
<ion that the recidivist question is one of
purely domestic policy, as in deprecating
unofficial discussion on the subject; he
is also to be commended for the calm and
equable spirit he has all along maintained*
in the face of the storm of yelping snarls
which British-cum-Australian Jingoism has
kicked up about the matter. If the boot
were on the other leg, now, and were Eng-
land about to despatch, or having des-
patched, a gang of convicts to Barbados, to
be insulted by the expression of a deter-
mination on the part of the United States
to maintain a cordon round that island lest
escapees of some of the British rascaldom
should contaminate Yankee morals, O ye
gods, what a hubbub would Jingoism then
raise about insult to the glorious liag that
had braved, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera! O
how true, how very, very true, it is that—
Of all the sarse one can call to mind
England does make the most unpleasant kind:
It’s you’re the sinner oilers, she’s the saint;
Wat’s good’s all English, all that isn’t aint.
This most objectionable spirit, when dis-
played by the old country, is sometimes
only ridiculous; when, however, it is dis.
played by a young British colony, or a
group of young British colonies (vir-
tually independent) it is always mischievious
as well as ridiculous- These Australian
colonies need a blending of races in their
populations, in order to prevent a most Phi-
listinio puritanism from becoming rampant.
For them to quarrel with republican Franc©
(with whom it would be well were their
relations exceeding intimate) is most un-
wise. Of course the British Conservatism,
that is mortally offended at the prodigious
prosperity of Republican France, jumps
with avidity at any pretext for a quarrel with
her. And in what the British Conservative
does he has, unfortunately, only too many
silly imitators in Australia—hence the dis-
graceful way in which the recidivist question
is being discussed. It is obvious to any un-
prejudiced mind that the chances of future
peace in the vast Pacific archipelago would
really be better were Great Britain not to
possess a preponderating influence. In the
island groups not as yet appropriated by any
of the civilized Powers the establishment of
free colonies under international protection
would be by far the most advantageous ar-
arrangement. Any attempt by Great Britain
at wholesale Polynesian annexation must in-
evitably lead to trouble with France and
Germany, if not with the United States,
with Spain, and with the Netherlands as well.
The true pacific policy in the Pacific is an
international policy—the wise blending, not
the mad collision, of interests.
• • *
The Australasian politicians who are mak-
ing such a monstrous hubbub over the
recidivist question profess an exceeding
loyalty to England, yet are unable to see
that their action is directly calculated, if not
absolutely to imperil, at least to seriously
prejudice the true interests of the empire.
But abject loyalty is invariably prejudicial
to its object. The task set to Australians is
to colonise Australia—a task of surpassing
magnitude and dignity, one, also, that de-
mands untiring exertion and exclusive
devotion. This work lies wholly at home
within the boundaries of the Australian Con-
tinent, not much more than the mere fringe
of which has as yet been settled. Austra-
lians have the means at their control to
keep out of their Continent whom they do
not choose to have amongst them. That
power should suffice them —unless, indeed,
in their dealings with France (as the owner
of a neighbour settlement) they can con-
vince that truly economic country that
transportation is not economic, as we be-
lieve could easily be done, since French
statesmen are eminently practical, while
Australian experience on the point is so
considerable.
• • •
Escaped recidivists do cause us some
trouble and expense: yet they hardly ever
succeed? in eluding our detection. They
are almost invariably promptly secured.
With regard, however, to British reddi/viste,
the Australian colonies that maintain immi-
gration services are not so particular. No
precautions, or next to none, are taken
against our awn proper “ habitual criminal”
classes being recruited now and again from
the “old country.” Were a little of the
violent energy that is being devoted to a
trouble which because, when it does occur,
is direct and palpable, and so easily grappled
with, expended upon the indirect and less
palpable, but still quite as serious, trouble
that lurks in our very carelessly adminis-
tered immigration service, much good would
be the result. Whereas, from the devotion
of frenzied political bigotry to wickedly
essaying to make a casus belli out of a diffi-
culty easily removable by the exercise of a
little savoir faire. a little courtesy, and a
little mutual good will, harm must inevit-
ably be the consequence—unless by good
luck the influence of the democratic party
should prevail, to the relegation of the idiotic
advocates of mischievous “spread-eagleism
to a back seat—a consummation most de-
voutly to be wished.

The stoppage of the Oriental Bank set the
city a-buzzing on Saturday and Monday. The
general feeling In Sydney seems to be thankful-
ness that the case wasn’t worse. There is a general
hope that the creditors of the Bank will be paid in
full, and a decided expectation that they will
recover at least a large proportion of their claims.
In Sydney, the personal popularity of the manager,
Mr. Balfour, has helped to smooth matters, and, in
lieu of an angry crowd hammering at doors and
breaking windows, his trouble has been interrup-
tion to the rush of work which the catastrophe at
the Bank thrust upon its officers, by customers,
even including some who have heavy deposits,
calling to express their sympathy and good will,
quite as much as to satisfy thoir anxiety as to
prospects of recoupment.
of conferring titles upon any of the people
of this country, met at the hands of the
Legislative Assembly the fate that it richly
deserved. With that characteristic obliquity
of mental vision which mars all prospect of
his ever attaining to political usefulness,
Mr. Buchanan left wholly untouched the
one point in connection with the practice
he assailed which can logically be regarded
jis vulnerable, so long as the colony of New
South Wales (however democratic its social
and political institutions may be) remains a
dependency of monarchical Great Britain,
However true in the abstract may be the
bald proposition that the practice of con-
ferring aristocratic titles and distinctions,
peerages, baronetcies, knighthoods, com-
panionships of illustrious Orders and what
not, is a ridiculous custom, unworthy
of and dishonouring to real manliness
and essential worth, it is, so far at least as
Great Britain is concerned, an imperial
practice the abolition or reform of which is
not to be effected by the action of a single
dependency. So long as the colony of New
South Wales is part and parcel of the British
Empire, so long will the people of New
South Wales naturally and reasonably ex-
pect to be treated upon a perfect social and
political equality with the people of the
mother country. Even persons who them-
selves disdain titles, and regard with dis-
favour the practice of conferring them, will
yet hardly go the extreme length of urging
the immediate abrogation of its application
in New South Wales, lest by so doing they
should seem to sanction the curtailment of
what is regarded as a sort of right common
to every British subject—the right of being
selected a recipient of the Sovereign’s special
favour. The vulnerable point in the prac-
tice of conferring titles, so far as New South
Wales colonists are concerned, lies in the
fact that, as administered, it is unconstitu-
tional. The essential element of responsi-
bility is wholly lacking. Titular distinctions
have been conferred upon New South Wales
colonists, as it were, behind the backs of the
Queen’s responsible Ministers in and for the
colony of New South Wales. Here, there-
fore, is the weak point of the prac'ice.
* * *
Sir George Grey, when Premier of New
Zealand, fully recognised that this was the
weak point of the practice in question : and
most ably he exposed it in a letter (dated
July, 1879) to Sir M. Hicks-Beach, the then
Secretary of State for the Colonies. In this
letter (written with special reference to the
circumstances under which Sir E. Stafford
and Sir W. Fox, leading members of the
Opposition, had obtained knighthoods) he
observes : “ The honour conferred on him
(Fox) —knighthood—is one known to the
Constitution. It emanated from the
proper source—the Crown, the foun-
tain of Honour. But the recognised rule
is that such honours are only conferred
by the Crown upon proper, responsible ad-
vice. . . In the present case, no such re-
sponsible advice was really tendered. The
Crown has within New Zealand, under its
Constitution, recognised responsible ad-
visers. Their advice was never sought. . .
At the time, Sir W. Fox was in violent oppo-
sition, and making public communications
whichwere embarrassing to the Government,
with the native race. The action of the,
Crown, therefore, had the aspect of a party
movement of an embarrassing nature. . .
In the case of any colony where a represen-
tative Constitution exists, in reference to
services rendered in such colony in regard
to its internal management or its internal
political affairs, the Crown cannot (I respect-
fully believe) constitutionally bestow such
honours without the advice of Ministers
who are responsible to the people of that
colony. The Secretary of State is not so in
any way whatever. Nor can (I believe)
any Minister of the Crown in England con-
stitutionally correspond with members of
the Opposition, or with any other person in
this colony, regarding rewards for political
services rendered to the colony and in rela-
tion to its internal government, otherwise
than through its responsible Ministers. If
such claims be maintained by the Secretary
of State, true responsible Governmentinthe
colony becomes impossible.”
• m m
Yes, in the absence of the element of con-
stitutional responsibility, the essential ele-
ment of political liberty, lies the vulnerable
point of the practice in question. Attack
this point, or rather insist upon the reform
of the practice in this vital particular, and
then as the healthy democratic spirit de-
velopes itself in New South Wales more and
more, the abrogation, of the obnoxious
custom will become assured by a consistent,
gradual process: since, go soon as the Queen’s
Ministers in and for New South Wales
represent a prevail!n g sentiment that titles
and distinctions are inconsistent with the
spirit of our democratic institutions, no
recommendations to have them conferred
will be made to the Fountain of Honour.”
* * m
There is another; consideration, which
seems to have esc aped Sir George Grey’s
notice, just as it rud Mr. Buchanan’s. It is
this: while the pi.-notice of conferring titles
and distinctions upon the colonists of New
South Wales caw be conducted without
either the sanction or the knowledge of Her
Majesty’s respousiblo Ministers in and lor
New South Wales, the British Government,
whose home interests are not unfrequently
diametrically antagonistic to the home
interests of this colony, has it in its power to
dangle stars and ribands and patents before
the eyes of our local politicians, in order to
seduce them by such glittering gewgaws
into betraying their country. How insidi-
ously effective such methods of seduction
can be, modern British history, unfortu-
nately for the honour and probity
of her statesmen, affords only too many
illustrations. The legislative union of
Great Britain and Ireland was notori-
ously carried by wholesale corruption
and fraud, and the worst form which
that monstrous corruption assumed was the
utterly shameless way in which honours (?)
were showered upon the utterly shameless
crew of Boyl.es, Handcocks, Hutchisons
and Loft dses, the traitorous “ undertakers ”
who bartered the liberties of their country
for peerages and place. It is not difficult to
imagine what would be the result if, as is
proposed by Sir Henry Parkes and other
turncoats from democratic principles, an
Australian Council were to sit in London.
The views of such a Council would most
assuredly soon grow distinctly tainted with
what its members might be pleased to de-
nominate “ imperialistic impressions,” but
which, in truth, would be English impres-
sions—impressions more or less biassed by
hopes of winning a “distinction” from
a crafty Secretary of State, the actual Foun-
tain of Honour!
• • •
Or even in the colony, where the counter-
vailing effect of popular Liberal opinion
might be expected to exist, Downing-streeP
upon a day of crisis and decision, when the
political liberties of this community hung
trembling in the balance, might be able by
following in the footsteps of Castubreagh
and Pitt, to seduce from the patriot ranks
a sufficiency of traitors to turn the scale in
favour of some accursed jingoistic measure
hostile to the cause of Freedom the wide
world over.
• • •
What the earnest Liberals of New South
Wales should first aim at is tbe reform of
the practice of conferring titles upon
colonists, on the strictly constitutional lines
laid down by Sir George Grey. The pro-
posed reform is one in the agitation for
which both those who consider the jiraotioe
wrong and mischievous in the abstract, and
those who do not regard it with absolute
disfavour, can co-operate. It is a practical
proposal, whereas that of Mr. Buchanan
was not, under existing conditions. To talk
as that gentleman did of the absurdity of
titles to an Assembly in which sit dozens of
members who are personally itching for a
C.M.G.-ship, and scores of members who
have been taught to regard a title as
a legitimate object of ambition, was a
still greater absurdity. Whereas, there
is no reason whatever to doubt that
a Legislative Assembly, professedly ex-
tremely zealous for the strictest observance
o' the Constitutional doctrine of Responsi-
bility, might, without much difficulty, be
induced to resolve that, in their deliberate
opinion, no title or distinction ought to be
conferred by the Crown upon any of the
people of this country except upon the
recommendation of the responsible Minister
of the Sovereign in and for the colony of
New South Wales. Unless, indeed, the local
Legislature does adopt and firmly maintain
aresolution of that kind, responsible Govern-
ment in New South Wales will run a great
chance of degenerating into a farce.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Unemployed.
There are over two thousand men out of
work in Sydney at the present time. Their feel-
ings are naturally neither philosophically nor
religiously resigned. They are bitter against the
Government and the condition of things generally.
But the fault does not lie at the doors of the
Government. The depression is simply an ebb of
enterprise. There will be a full tide in due course.
We sympathise with the majority of these men.
There is a minority among them for which we
have no sympathy. You will understand what we
mean when we tell you that one day last week,
when there was a large meeting of the unemployed
at the Hyde Park gates, and whife one of the
speakers was giving a very graphic, if rather
gruesome, description of starvation (which he
said was .staring his hearers in the face), a man
drove up in a buvgy and offered as many
men as chose to take it work at five shillings
a day—which they unanimously refused. Now,
five shillings a day is not princely pay, but the
men who refused it must bo fond either of starving
or of lying. And we don’t think they are fond of
starving. Among the unemployed there are a
great many new arrivals. These labour under a
hallucination which they will do well to get rid of
as soon as possible. It Is that they are entitled to
a certain rate of wages, and that those who offer
them less are trying to cheat them. Consequently
they hang on from day to day, and grumble in
groups, and grow seedier and seedier rather than
accept work at what they consider an unfair price.
Now, there is no denying that the pamphlets about
the colonies they have seen before coming out
give an account of the current rates of wages paid
for various kinds of labour. But it must be
remembered that these rates represent what
is paid to old hands—men who have lived
and worked for some time in the Colonies. A new
arrival anywhere never does, and never will, get
paid as much as the tried workman whose abilities
are known. It is necessary to settle down and
assimilate with the new order of things before
asking to be raised to the same level as men who
have paid for their experience. Men who are any
good to this country will look the situation in the
face and take what work they can get till better
times come, and they in their turn, instead of
asking for employment, can command it. But the
other kind of men, who will not work unless they
get the pay they want, are of no good to us unless
we could prevail on Bishop Barry to make par-
sons of them.
It is really extraordinary how the evil passions
roused by war blind people to disgraceful acts,
perpetrated in the name of their own nation —acts
which, if committed by the enemy, or in the name
of any foreign power, they would instantly de-
nounce with Indignation as barbarous and de-
grading. In looking through our flies of the
principal London weeklies just received, we are
struck by the general absence of comment
on the proclamation, by General Gkaham and
Admiral Hewett, of a reward to anyone
who would assassinate Osman Digna, Vanity
Fair is the only weekly in which we have
found so much as a reference to the matter. It is
fair to say, however, that Vanity Fair seems to
appreciate the moral Iniquity of the incident. Its
comments are of the briefest—thus: “The Gov-
ernment goes on from bad to worse. TheJMilitary
Commander in Egypt actually issued a proclama-
tion setting a price on the head of Osman Digna>
More than a year ago we had to comment on the
similarity between the Dublin Invincibles and
those of Alexandria. Had not the Government at
home compelled the withdrawal of the infamous
proclamation, the identity of the two would have
been complete, and the name of the good-
natured, but careless Lord Granville would
have been in the face of all Europe dis-
played as on a par with that of Joe Brady.”
It will be an evil day for Old England when its
journalists with one consent abstain from anim-
adverting on acts which tend to stain its annals
and lower the manliness of the national sentiment.
The thing was a bitter disgrace: and even here in
Australia there was scarcely one journal besides
oar own which showed its preference for principle
over maudlin and unreasoning national vanity, by
commenting on the affair with downright em-
phasis. The Ec,HO deprecated the proclamation,
indeed, but only on the grounds that it might be
awkward were the Mahdi to retaliate by setting a
price on the head of General Gordon I And the
Echo is a serious and moral paper.

A new Commercial Bank started in Sydney

A significant reminder of the “measure-

to the fascinating Kate Vaughan when, a few

as an old lady of sixty, at the new Novelty Theatre.
It isn’t nice for a “ possible ” duchess, like Kate, to
find that such a near relative has arrived at an
age when she can even play “ first old woman,”
with success. Kate ought to bring Colonel
Wellesley up to the scratch before he fastens his
giddy affections to something younger.
“One of the Guards” writes to a London
paper:—“We are glad you oppose the return of
Valentine Baker. We do not want him. It is very
well for the Standard to say it has had hundreds
of letters from ladles (?) advocating his re-admls-
Bion into society; doubtless most of these ladies
only lament they were not in the train with him
when Miss Dickinson was, so as to be recipients of
the favours ho was so anxious to bestow.’' This is
rough on the Prince of Wales’s friend. We don’t
catch any of the “under-current of a sob” in it
that Archie Forbes fancied he heard from the 10th
Hussars. And we may add, that the Standard
may have received hundreds of letters; but we
don’t think on? of them was from a lady.
Prince William, the eldest son of the
Crown Prince of Germany, appears to have some
of the amorous proclivities of his grandfather, the
old Emperor—" his greatest fault,” says modern
society, after dilating upon his accomplishments
and natural abilities, “ is a pronounced suscepti-
bility to feminine blandishments.” But there’s
every excuse for the poor young Prince ; he’s
only twenty-four, and (according to the same
estimable authority) “ his wife is a person of too
much insignificance to exercise any restraint
upon his spirited nature ; even now she is neg-
lected by him. She is possessed of no charms
potent enough to attract or to retain him.” We
often reckon up our missus like that, till she closes
the discussion with a flat-iron.
The quarrel between Prince Frederick
Charles of Prussia and his wife has been patched
up; and the organs of the Throne are rejoiced that
this “ scandal ,r haa been “ removed.” The process
of removing the “ scandal ” is peculiar. The
coarse, brutalised, hard-drinking trooper, Fred-
erick Charles, is left at liberty to continue his
liaisons with the “ladles ” of the Court on whose
account his Princess was driven from her home
and forced to go to her friends. The now palace
which the “happy couple” are to inhabit is to
have two staircases, one of which is to be for the
exclusive use of the Princess, free from the in-
trusion of her husband or his mistresses. The
Princess is only to be required to submit to the
humiliation of dining with the Prince on official
occasions. Her horses, carriages, and servants are
to be free from the control of the Prince or his
marshal.
We are charmed to observe in a copy of
the Court Journal, kindly marked for us and
Soatod to us by Jack Heaton—we beg pardon, J.
[cnnikor Heaton. Esq.,—that Mrs. Ja—we mean
Mrs. J. Henniker Heaton, Esq.—attended the last
Drawing Room. A throb of pride will quiver
through the colonies on learning that they have
been thus honoured in the person of the wife of
one of the most noble and high-minded of their
fellows. The Court Journal says:—“Mrs. J.
Henniker Heaton (an Australian lady) was attired
in a becoming dress of black Lyons velvet, Spanish
lace, and natural roses, which was particularly
noticed for its elegance; she also wore a magnifi-
cent set of diamonds.” These will be the Heaton
family diamonds, we presume. Yet we can re-
member the time when Henniker used modestly
to content himself by wearing paste—the office
paste. He used to wear it all over the front of his
apron.
Old Mick Kennedy, of Parkes, has turned
up his toes to the green. In the days of his prime,
Mick loved the taste of a shindy. Years ago, long
before Parkes was where it is now, the Bushman’s
dam was the only water for the diggers at the old
Currajong. One time, when the dam was getting
low, word came along that Forlonge had 15,000 I
sheep which he intended watering there. The
diggers marched down, Kennedy ahead, deter-
mined to defend this water at all hazards. The
15,0C0 sheep and the overseers, sfippherds, 4c., were
marshalled along the, hill side, but the diggers, J
dared them to water at the risk of a free fight.
After some time, Kennedy got impatient, “ Bedad,
boys,” cried he, ‘“we’ve been waitin’ here these
two hours and ne’er a drop of blood spilt yet I”
Nothing came of his thirst for a melee, since the
shepherd force retired discreetly. We tell this lie
about the old fellow as the Parses Chronicle
tells it.
The Marquis of Lome, it is now definitely
understood, will be appointed Viceroy of India, on
the resignation of Lord Kipon, which may shortly
be expected. The Queen has expressed a “wish”
on the subject, and, all things considered, there is
not much to be said against the little family ar-
rangement, for the glamour of royalty which failed
to impress the straightforward, plain spoken Can-
adians will be just to the taste of Anglo-Indian
“Society,” Louise will find the ladies quite con-
tent to exhibit a liberal amount of “neca”at re-
ceptions, therefore her royal notions of etiquette
will not be outraged as in Canada, where strong
objections were raised against the rigid enforce-
ment of “undress” with a thermometer below
zero. Possibly, too, Lome cherishes secret hopes
that climatioal influences may accomplish wonder-
ful things for the family, and that India will
succeed where Canada failed. Ayahs are wonder-
fully good with children, you know.
Some days ago, H. T. Donaldson and Dr.
Pierce, when driving from Nolligen to Milton had
an adventure. In going down a cutting, where the
road in places was only ten feet wide, the horses
swerved, and before Donaldson could bring them
to a stand, horses and buggy were over the cut-
ting. Pierce had jumped out a minute or so
previously, but Donaldson kept his seat till the
buggy was in the act of going over, when he also
jumped out, and, being a life assurance agent,
naturally escaped without the least shock to his
system. Horses, baggage and buggy lay in a con-
fused mass some thirty feet below entangled in
underbrush. After unsuccessfully endeavouring
to cut the horses loose, Donaldson started off for
assistance, and soon despatched a couple of men
with axes to the scene of the accident. He then
walked into Milton, and returned the following
morning with a fresh buggy, when he found that
the previous evening the horses had been cut
loose, but one had his neck broken.
At the Supreme Court, Dunedin, N.Z.,
Dr, Parry, of Kaitangata, was Indicted on a charge
of manslaughter, found guilty, and provided with
furnished apartments, free of charge, ior four
months, at the expense of the colony. The doctor,
who was sent for at short notice to introduce
a new immigrant, was so drunk that he
thought he had a Chinaman with a broken leg for
patient, and acted accordingly. This treatment of
of the case, not being in accordance with the usual
practice of the profession, the victim of misplaced
confidence died from the injuries she received at
his hands. Before her death the doctor went to
sleep but was roused up again by an old lady who
propped him up on the sofa, washed his face,
combed his hair, and fixed him inside of a clean
white shirt. When the husband came home and
enquired for his wife the doctor took in hand to
break the sad news to him gently, and said “H’ml
my hoy I Shake hands and I’ll give you-hic—the
straight tip—She’s a dead wife to you, H’m—that’s
what she is—a regular goner, old man.”
Mr. F. A. Packer, of Hobart, writes us as
follows:—“I observe on page 17 of The Bulletin
of 19th April that one of your regular correspond-
ents, in referring to Charles Packer’s oratorio
The Crown of Thorns, says: ‘ I have heard that
Mr. Stanley, of Stanmore, is responsible for not a
little of that beautiful work, but I cannot vouch
for the truth of it. Anyhow, if ho is, he is very
modest about it.’ I beg you will allow me to state
that my late uncle, at my very urgent request,
very reluctantly gave me, when in Melbourne, his
original score of the oratorio for the purpose of
having a copy made for myself. Every note of
the work was in his own handwriting, and it was
an exceedingly difficult thing for me to explain to
the copyist the numberless corrections, additions,
and emendations, evidently made by the author as
it progressed. That copy, in justice to the excep-
tionally gifted composer’s musical fame, is entirely
at the service of any musician who desires to com-
pare the MS. with the work as printed. I take it
for granted that Mr. Stanley will at once endorse
my statement.”
The quarrel betwixt Anglican parson Rosa
and ex-policeman O’Neill, both of Queanbeyan,
waxeth hot and hotter. In his latest epistolary
deliverance the parson thinks he clinches the fact
of his exceptionally high social and professional
status by the following delicious assertion : -
‘ When I have served one of the best churches in
Australasia—a church attended by the Governor—
I have nothing to fear.” The late lamented Dr.
Dodd used to servo the Chapel Royal and yet—
)arson Ross can perhaps supply the vacuum. In
<he same letter whence the above quotation is
taken also occurs another clincher. “1 can show
to any proper person that 1 have in my possession
a dog from the kennel and strain of a British peer
of the realm,” There now, ye scorners! why, by
the blessed wig of the never to be sufficiently
venerated St. Louis Quatorze, it ought to be a
pleasure to be bitten by so aristocratic a our—
to say nothing of the ecstacy to be derived from
being preached to by a levite who has served in a
church attended by a (governor. Throw up the
sponge, O’Neill.
Cornelius Fuchs Corrigan, a native of Tas-
mania, was, until recently, an aristocratic bank
clerk in New Zealand. How it fell out we cannot
say, but a little while afro Cornelius and the bank
parted company, and since then, while the latter
has paid the usual dividends, Cornelius has not,
somehow, exhibited the same extent of spotless
shirt-front and snowy cuffs as before the deed of
separation took effect. Cornelius, in fact, has been
low down on his luck, but determined to improve
matters lately, he borrowed several blank cheques
and went to work. Atone establishment in Christ-
church he bought a plough and some other, agricul-
tural Implements, paying for them with a cheque
he signed “ Watt & Co . Blenheim.” With another
document he Invested in a hhd. of beer, and with a
third he shouted for a friend, and an obliging:
landlord gave him cash to the extent of £i 10a in
change. Cornelius then took a little breathing
space—paused, as it were, for a reply from the
bank at Benheim—and then one day found himself
in the lock-up. Then came a day of reckoning 1
before Judge Johnston and a jury. Itosult, three
years.
A story of “Chinese” Gordon was told
recently by an old Artillery pensioner. The first
day on which fire was opened at Sebastopol from
the twenty-one gun battery, the sand-bags form-
ing one of the embrasures caught fire from the
flash of a too closely mounted gun. A corporal
and a sapper of the Engineers were told off to re-
pair the damage. The corporal ordered the sap-
per to mount the embrasure, and proposed to hand
up the fresh bags to him. They were under heavv
fire at the time, and the sapper, with some want of
discipline certainly, demurred to this arrange-
ment, and suggested that the corporal should get
up, and that he (the sapper) would go on with the
_handing-up business. There was a bit of a wrangle
oyer it. Gordon, who was passing, inquired into
£ vt ma^er and quietly telling the corporal,
Never order a man to do what you are afraid
to do yourself,” got up on the pile of bags himself,
and said. Come up here, both of you,” and then
ordered the men who were working the gun to
hand the bags un. The storm of bullets swept
oyer Gordon and the two men, but his charmed
life seemed to protect the trio. He finished his
work, and came down as coolly as he had mounted,
but the lesson was never forgotten by those
around.
Mr. W. H. Nicholls, State schoolmaster of
Ballarat, has been appointed by the vote of the
teachers a classifier under the Victorian Education
Department. This board has been set going with
a view to settle the status of hundreds of teachers
who are most justly dissatisfied with the years of
departmental and political dodgery which have
there, as here, led to no end of corruption. Mr.
Nicholes is a scholar of the best style—he is not only
a successful teacher and trainer of teachers, having
trained privately nearly as many as the training
school, but a man of high scientific attainment i
and sound sense. It was through his exertions
that the system of instruction in the Ballarat
School of Mines was shown up, and a system of
real instruction substituted for a pretentious and
absurd travesty. He is a man of about forty, as
cultivated as Matthew Arnold, and with much
more practical common sense. It would not be
amiss if a few suck men could be employed in
N S.W. to look into old abuses and try to rectify
some of the[|blunders of the old blunderers who
have spent our millions on what they call “ ad-
ministering’’the Education vote. When a majority
of the teachers are discontented, and yet three
quarters of a million are wanted yearly, it is high
time a few hundreds more were spent to find a
remedy.
The pioneer of Hay is dead. Dr. Thomas
Lang is—or rather was—the man we mean. Long
years ago he went out into what was then the
wilderness, nnd bought the rights of the explorer,
Benjamin Boyd, in that part of the country which
surrounds what is now the town of Hay. Dr. Lang
had several large runs, and was a rich man. The
rest we quote from the Riverine Grazier.
“When the drought and the fall in wool took
place that ruined Hugh Glass, Degraves, and other
enterprising men. Dr. Lang fared 111, and had to
fall under the pressure of the banks, losing all his
stations. Since then he has been living quietly on
his selection, living on its proceeds and his prac-
tice. He was 74 years of age, and leaves, we be-
lieve, three children, who have long since gone
forth into the world.” The lives of men like this
will make the early history of our country as
delightful to the coming generations as the pages
of Livy are to us, when the poor political pheno-
menons (we will use what kind of a plural we
please, thank you,) are altogether forgotten, or
remembered only by the student with a smile of
derision. Of couise, we do not allude to Andy
Lynch.
The miserable persecution of Richard
Belt, the sculptor, by an envious clique of stiff
necked Academicians, has come to a fitting termi-
nation. Charles Lawes, the defendant in the libel
case, has, after moving heaven and earth to pro-
cure a new trial, without success, played his last
card, and-filed a petition in bankruptcy. So
Belt, after coming triumphantly out of the ordeal
with a verdict for £5000 damages, will, apparently,
be largely out of pocket over the transaction.
His own costs, It is stated, will exceed nine thousand
pounds; therefore, in the event of the)insolvent
paying as much as ten shillings in the pound, the
much maligned sculptor must make a loss of two
thousand. Such a climax would be sufficiently
disgraceful, even if it were not known that Lawes
has been all along merely the Instrument with
which the Royal Academicians (Sir Fred. Leighton
at their head) were endeavouring to crush Belt.
Large sums of money have been collected among
them for the purpose of providing Lawes with the
sinews of war, and It has, doubtless, been an
understood thing that their adversary was to be
let In” in this shameful manner, provided their
case failed. Lawes is the only son of an exceed-
ingly rich man—Sir John Bennett Lawes—and the
old ’un ought not to have let the “ boy ” make
such a mean skunk of himself.
The restless spirit which landed Colonel
Burnaby in the thick of the war against the Arabs
took another officer of the Guards on a journey
not quite so perilous, but not less interesting. It
was Colonel Colville, of the Grenadier Guards, who
went over to Arabia to survey the site of the pro-
posed Jordan Valley Canal. Colville went right
across the desert from Egypt, riding on camels,
and following the old pilgrim tract. It was a long,
lonely journey, and full of interesting episodes.
At one time he came upon a vast camp of Arabs
on their way to Mecca. The way of getting about
in these parts is to pay blackmail to the chiefs who
hold sway over successive tracts of country. For
this money they provide camels and a safe con-
duct. The geographical limit of their territory,
though it does not appear on any maps, is clearly
marked. At a particular spot one chief’s territorv
finishes and another begins, and there arises
necessity tor more blackmail and a change cf
camels. Colonel Colville had with him one com-

“Where is he now?” was a question put to the
colonel. “Probably in a Russian prison,” he
answered. “ He went off to sketch on the Russian
frontier, a pursuit of artistic desire with which
the Russian military officers deal very promptly.”

At Christchurch (fr.Z.) Mr. David Howard
Moncrieff Ogilvy went up lately for three years
for forgery. David was too extensively baptised
in early life to come to any good end. We never
yet knew a fellow with a galaxy of illustrious
names in front of him who didn’t steal, embezzle,
or commit some other mean trick in revenge for
the injustice done him in the way of nomenclature.
David Howard &c., however, was no common
character. He possessed undoubted credentials
which proved him to be a man of considerable
ability. He is an accomplished linguist, and can
talk and correspond in six or seven European and
Asiatic languages. He was for many years foreign
correspondent for the London firm of James Mac-
andrew and Co. at their branch house at Smyrna
in Asia Minor. When the Russo-Turklsh war broke
out. the firm withdrew their business from Smyrna,
and Ogilvy got an engagement as interpreter under
Baker Pasha, and followed that warrior into many
a daring encounter, receiving on one occasion the
compliments of a Cossack in the shape of a sabre-
cut on the head. David emigrated to New Zealand
lately, and found his numerous languages of no
service to him in earning a livelihood. At Christ-
church he was reduced to beggary—sleeping in
out-houses and under trees, sometimes for days
without food. Eventually he forged a cheque,
drank the proceeds, was arrested, and found in
board and lodgings for three years.
James Logan, of Dunolly (Yic.), stands up
for his rights and privileges. Some time ago he
was elected a member of the local hospital com-
mittee. The other members didn’t like him. Why
they didn’t is beside the question. Perhaps he
didn’t use his “ h’s ” properly, or perhaps his blood
is not blue enough (although his name is rather
against this conjecture), or perhaps he would not
stand treat freely enough for the leading men of
the town, who, as a matter of course, are hospital
committee men. Far out, any of these reasons
calls for strict ostracism. At all events, his brother
members tried to freeze James out. But it would
take a mighty hard frost to get through the epi-
dermis of James. Then they coughed him down
when he spoke. But James liked to hear himself
talking, and he took his little pleasure out just as
if millions listened. Then, when voting came, they
tried not to see his right hand. But he brandished
it, and made them see it. Then they plumply said
they wouldn’t count him, and his name was not let
appear for or against any question in the minute-
book. So James Logan has arisen. He has put his
case into the Equity Court, and has feed a strong
Melbourne bar. He has issued writs against each
member of the committee, so that the fun will be
all round. If be lose, James is down for a big
thing; but if he win, .each member will be per-
sonally responsible fOr the cost of the candle.
Divested of the atrocious nature of its
manifest truthfulness, the following story of a
snake ought to commend itself to the scientific
world in general. It happened to be at Chiltcrn
(Vic.) this time, and as the bootless monster was
enjoying the scenery of the Chiltern Park, a dog
by the name of Bo’sun smelt at the varmint and
set it going. Before Bo’sun had time to reflect on
the foolishness of his proceeding, he was carefully
bitten in the right jowl; and, being ina“recipro-
citous” mood that day, he grabbed the snake’s
tail in his mouth and began to chew it. This led
the snake to believe that Bo’sun was not actuated
by friendly feelings towards him, and he accord-
ingly began to travel. Speaking of t his, the local
paper observes the representative of Eve’s seducer
“climbed up a telegraph post, ;and then crossed
over to the island on one of the telegraph wires.
The distance from post to post is about 40 yards,
and the snake took 10 minutes to perform the
feat.” All of which is strictly true, but why
should the journal in question ignore the fact that
Bo’sun not only followed his snakeship, but
actually tapped the wires, read off a telegram to
the effect that Kong Meng shares had risen to £37
10s, and then dropped the snake chase, and re-
turned with the information to his owner, who
bought into the elaim and amassed a handsome
fortune. What’s the use of telling reptile yarns
at all if you do not confine yourself to stiict tacts?
There aren’t many men of the name of
Mlrls in Victoria. Yet the colony doesn’t show
signs of coming to an end on that account. As
long as the Smiths hold out, it can reckon on a
constantly increasing population. But the want
of a decent supply of Mlrls is a disadvantage to
the lew who own that name. For Instance, when
somebody says “Mlrls said this,” or “Mirls said
that,” everybody goes home and tells his wite
that Mr. Mlrls, the locomotive superintendent,
said this or that. The consequence is that Mr.
Mirls is put in some awkward predicaments. The
other day Mr. Speight, chairman of the railway
commissioners, ordered all trains to be at once
fitted with continuous brakes. Some Mirls said:
“The order is bosh; the brakes aren’t wanted.”
Thereupon, everyone told his wife that “Mr.
Mirls, the locomotive superintendent, had called
Speight’s order bosh.” And after the wives
had cried “Lawk a mussy,” Service jumped
up and ordered a board of inquiry to s't and
ascertain if such language had been used.
Of course the language was used. But by an-
other Mlrls altogether. It may appear to some
that if there were more Mlrls the disadvantage to
this Mirls would be still greater. But close in-
spection will reveal otherwise. Multitude shelters
individuality. To say Smith does so and so, does
not expose any particular Smith. To bring a par-
ticular Smith to the mind of a hearer you must
go through a long list of baptismal, geographical,
social, professional, and other items. E. g., “ L. L..
late the residence of his Excellency. At home off
and on. Look well into thy heart. Packets sealed
from observation.” Why don’t you call yourself
Smith, Mirls ? But perhaps you’d rather stand an
inquiry every day than do it. Perhaps. And it
shows your taste.
Perhaps a few words will be interesting
about the peppery painter who lately had such a
severe quarrel with Mr*. Mackay. His vanity and
irascibility are both sc sensitive that it is almost
impossible to talk with Melssonier without affront-
ing him, and it is no wonder, therefore, that such
a peculiar artist should have been frantic when
the portrait he painted for Mrs. Mackay met with
its melancholy and malodorous fate. He laid
himself open to it, because in portrait painting he
does not excel. In evervthlng else he is certainly
the highest paid, if not the greatest, of the artists
NOT LIKELY.
Practical Mistress (after giving a demonstration): “There now, Jane, that’s the

Of modern France; equal, they say, to any praise
that pen can give him. Like Victor Hugo, in the
realm of literature, so Meissonier. now years of
passes his declining days amid the radiance of
nfs ’own past splendid works. He is personally
iinnooular, because he is so irritable and eccentric,
so Conceited, and so blunt in his criticism of others.
That is the reason so few venture to visit his mag-
nificent residence and studio in Paris. It will not do
to prefer one of his pictures to another, for in his
Bvee they are all perfect, and each of surpassing
merit H is dangerous to ask if any picture is for
Sip for he will not condescend to the details of
barter with any stranger who wishes to buy. A
nowerfully-built torso, on short legs, has Jean
fouis Ernest Meissonier, the artist, with a head
like one of the grandest creations of Michael
Angelo, superb in its profusion of gray hair, flow-
ing” beard, and piercing eyes --a man to look at
nmiin— a figure of singular interest and history. It
ft over 50 years since Meissonier first commenced
liainting in Paris; and he does not like to speak of
that time. For years he nearly starved, endured
sufferings that required an iron frame to stand,
drew anything lor his daily bread. He copied
nictures in the Louvre galleries at the rate of four
shillings a square yard, decorated bonbon boxes,
fans and firescreens, with a minuteness that is
now’ wondered at. And yet, for years he was
neglected. But one day the “ Chess-player ’ was
exhibited in the salon. It attracted notice from
critics. It was new style. The era of a splendid
technique dawned, and Meissoner was a famous
man.
Ballarat had a great day of it on the 27th.
After a widowhood of fifteen months, it cast aside
the sable weeds and donned the blossoms. The
most reverend head of the house, Dr. O’Connor,
had sliddered, and the falling of tears and wring-
ing of hands had gone on until, on the last Sunday
in April, Monsignor Moore jumped the vacant
slippers. The Monsignor is a big man genealogi-
cally, intellectually, and physically. When it is
stated that he hails from the Emerald Isle, the first
point must stand confessed. Only a benighted
foreigner could be unaware that the line goes
right back to a royal stock. But even this ignor-
ance, if it should exist, can be rifted by a brief
narrative. When Prince Leopold died, Monsignor
Moore, alone of all the Catholic dignitaries in Vic-
toria, waxed grievously distressed, and dribbled
greasy blubber about the sanctuary. No reference
was made to the subject in the Catholic churches
of Melbourne or its suburbs. Remembering that
like feels for like, this incident rifts something.
D’ye see ? Intellectually, he is also big. He was a
student of All-Hallows College. That is an insti-
tution which stands immensely high as a theo-
logical educator. So immensely high, indeed, does
it stand, that the Church authorities at home
always send the men educated there away to the
outermost bounds of the earth, and seldom want
them back any more for ever. An All-Hallows
man can be counted on for understanding nearly
one-half of his Breviary. The other half he plods
through with the sure conviction that heaven
understands it, whatever it is. And Mpnsignor
Moore is also physically big. He is 6ft. 3in. in his
socks. So that the Church of Ballarat has got as
much of a man as it could expect. This is the
new Bishop, and the new Dad of the Poor. Arch-
bishop Goold consecrated him, and the whole
thing was gone through in a brilliant, dazzling
sort of a way. Several town-councillors, a lot of
mayors, and a long line of J.’sP. were there, And
John Duffy, the son of patriotic Gavan (who
escaped when better men went under), and the
Hon. N. Fitzgerald, and Dr. Brownless went up as
patrons. And Bishops Murphy, Reynolds, Lanigan,
and Torregiani, with a host of minor shovelhats,
were there. And they dressed Dr. Moore up in
bibs, cords, overalls, and spangles, until he looked
like one of Emelie Melville’s opera bouffers. There
they put him, sitting on a throne, clapped a mitre
on his head, gave him a crook, and with a sym-
bolical one. two, three, kicked him off. Now he is
the Dad of the Poor. And he began well. He
charged 5s. and 2s. for admission to see him, and
suspended the free list. Then he took over a
carriage and a pair of greys valued at £180 to help
him to go about. And then he Invited the leading
people to a dinner at his palace. That’s hnw the
Dad of the Poor spent his first day. There s
nothing like beginning well.
Jerusalem stoned the prophets. In all
probability Jerusalem was justified in its emphatic
action because the aforesaid prophets tipped
Martini for the last Leger. But when it comes to
a case of starving the inspired seers, we respect-
fully send up a cry to Heaven for summary juris-
diction. D. Brown [Hold on is this Bone
Brown Ed.B.], for instance, complains that he
has been for the past eleven weeks an Anglican
prophet of the Lord in a province called Nathalia;
and, so far as we can learn, the people of Nathalia
make a similar complaint. They were not anxious
for prophets, and least of all were they longing
for prophets of the D. Brown calibre. D. Brown
didn’t seem to strike their lancies. As our Bible
scholars remember, Saul of Tarsus used to get into
gaol, and was even flogged to enlist the sympa-
thies of the multitude, but D. Brown of Nathalia
didn’t. Consequently, the apostle Brown was
carefully sot in the mud by the general public.
Therefore, Brown the Evangelist has been com-
pelled of late to keep himself and his wife and
child on per week. That’s where Saul of
Tarsus held the bulge on Brown. Sauldidn t have
a wife andl child— or, at least, if he did, he kept
them dark. But D, Brown, he said they dldn t
know everything down in Judea, and accordingly
he took to himself a wife and family, and started
off to preach the gospel and to plant the church.
Apparently, however, they didn’t pay, and accord-
ingly, the pulpit-puncher being seized with a Tom-
Slattery-on-to-Tom-Butler mania, wrote to the
local papers, and complained as follows: From
information laid against me I have been requested
to leave the township. The complaints are as fol-
lows: (1) My inability to ride on horseback ; (2) My
sermons were useless; (3) Eating and drinking with
those my inferiors. As a recompense for my
labours, I have received from this and adjoining
parishes during eleven weeks the total sum of
£7 6s. lid., which will average 13s. 4|d. per week,
out of which I have had to pay 12s. per week rent,
and Is. each week for the use of the school
where I held service, thus leaving me per
week to keep my wife and child. Touching
item the first, wo remember that in the rouse-
about days of Bendigo, a former apostle
was requested to leave, and didn’t. Two days
after the notice was served, however, a demnltion
dead body was found dangling from a tree just
outside the township and causing much conster-
nation amongst the adventuresome crows of the
surrounding districts. Catching on to the second
complaint, the people of Nathali would seem to
be over-sensitive. Apostle Brown cannot sit a
“ bucker,” as be frankly admits* but the Nathalians
should remember that Saul was once badly thrown
also. Charge the third is that Brother Brown s
sermons were useless. If he resigns in conse-
quence, and all other gospel expounders follow
suit, this land willlsoon be as free from clerics as
it is from Bengal tigers. With respect to the
eating and drinking business, Mr. Brown observes
that if he didn’t feed when opportunity offered
he’d have died from starvation before he had
spent his first week in Nathalia. All of which leads
us to infer that there is a better opening for a dog
and monkey show in Nathalia than there is tor a
second edition of Dr. Barry.
A remarkable man in many respects is
Luke Gulson, the present Mayor of Albury. Re-
markable in the Border village as having read and
partly understood bhakespeare ; remark iblc as
naving the courage to have his hair out once a
month, in a land where short hair recalls sad
memories. A man “ dowered with the hate of
hate, the scorn of scorn, and the love” —of lect-
uring on Burns. Alas I we are all grotesquely
human on some point, and that is where it catches
Luke worst. He is a Paladin in the van of any cause
which his caprice or judgment approves, and a lion
in the path of anything it doesn’t—which is lots. He
has been for years the E. W. O’Sullivan of the
“ worrukin man ” in Albury, and the flagellator,
with a whip of scorpions, of all sorts and condi-
tions of people. We remember when an obese and
sepulchrallv respectable Government official, witfi
a big screw, was about leaving Albury once, he
(the official) was presented with a purse of sover-
eigns collected by a few frantic adorers from a
dazzled public. Then it was that the bordericono-
clast arose in his towering sublimity. He bribed
a fallen tower of the wood-and-water-joey per-
suasion called “ Tommy the Londoner,” to allow
himself to be made the object of a similar public
recognition, which duly came off, amid the
plaudits of a yelling populace. The present
Mayor boldly conducted the whole circus, and
read letters from the principal maintenance men
and leading Chinese gardeners apologising for
their absence, and bearing high testimony to the
honourable manner in which the poor old bum-
mer had discharged the duties of his position, and
again, we remember, when a jury had occasion to
censure the Government medical officer, and the
two local papers sailed into the jury therefor,
the jury turned to Luke in the moment ot their
direct need. He worked up a big indignation
meeting to which the two editors wore invited,
and at which, after a world of Titantic slang-
whanging, the papers were burnt under their
respective noses. That’s the sort of hair-pin they
have for a Mayor in Albury. But with all this
splendour of achievement, he still harbours the
grisly delusion that he can talk Scotch. Once
once only, and no more—we went to hear him.
He was lecturing at the Mechanics on the Lite
and writings ot Burns.” After the newspaper
episode he seemed to regard himself as a greater
authority than usual on “burns.” Alderman
Frew, who was innocently present, was seduced
into the chair and the Golgotha began to de-
velop. The Life was told in English and went off
without incident, but “some words that were
warnings of doom ” fell from him as he approached
the Writings. By way of breaking it gently, he
said “mafreens,” quite successfully, and although
we saw the chairman’s face blanch, the foolish,
fascinated people stayed in their seats. By and
by, he let tall the word “clishmaclaver,” and an
awful expectancy came upon the shuddering
audience. The next stage was “joctelegs, and
the horror deepened. Then he quoted— 1 ance
was abused i’ the kirk for touzlin’ a lass i my
daffln,” which may have been the Gospel truth, but
it had the effect of making the chairman openly
fly for his life, and escape from the room by a
subterranean passage, whence we are happy to say,
he reached his home still breathing, but very low.
During the rendering of the “Address to a Haggis,
a brave and stalwart few (mostly Highlanders) made
a desperate rush for the door and escaped, but tno
women and children were left to their fate. It was
noted that the plaster in the ceiling of the Hall
turned blue next day, and the death-rate went up
33 9-100 that winter, Although the experience ot
that awful night curtailed our life, we forgave
him on account of his redeeming qualities, ana ms
solemn promise as Mayor to try Scotch nae
mair.”
Baron Albert Grant, of Emma Mine no-
toriety, who presented the Leicester Square
Gardens to the Londoners, and whoso stupendous
mansion at Hyde Park had to be pulled down
after his fortunes flickered, because no one could
be found willing to stand the expense of living m
it, is to the fore again in tremendous form. He
has projected and floated a monster company to
work certain gold mines In the South African
Transvaal, and the gigantic scope of his enterprise
is positively staggering. His prospectus is a
masterpiece of allurement. The area of the
“claim” is eighteen thousand acres, and when
one is through the prospectus the idea left on the
mind is that the whole surface of that tract
will pan out ever so many ounces to the ton
when put through treatment, while countless lodes
seam the strata, and are all richly impregnated
with gold. The Baron appears to have captured
all the great scientific authorities he could lay
hold of—men with magnificent status and no prac-
tical acquaintance with the industry of gold min-
ing, and to have used them, without their being
aware of it, a a decoy ducks. Thus the report,
after inspection of the ground—conceive a man,
however scientific, pretending to Shy, how the
reefs and alluvial in 18,000 acres will yield in the
aggregate—he puts most prominently forward is
from a John M. Stuart, Esq.. M. Soc. Arte, F.R.G.S,
and a bier figure in the list of the staff is the
1 “ mineralogist, geologist, and assayer, Professor
1 M. Forster-Heddle, M.D., F.R.S. Edm., President
of the Mineralogical Society of Great Britain and
Ireland, Past President of the Geological Society
of Edinburgh, and Professor of Chemistry in the
University of St. Andrew’s,” a gentleman of
splendid abilities and attainments as a closet mine-
ralogist, field geologist, and lecture-room chemist,
but who has been rusting for a decade in St. Andrews
in a professor’s berth, which scarcely found him in
bread and butter, and who knows about as much
of gold-fields as did the late lamented Queen Anne,
as he has never been out of Europe, and scarcely
out of Scotland, in his life. We know all about
him, you see, because he happens to be oar
uncle. Well, here is the style in which John M.
Stuart, Eeq., M. Soc. Arte and F.R.G.S., reports;—
“ Mr. Stuart has supplied a very elaborate report,
with drawings and diagrams; he places the whole
vein-matter, ore and slate worked together, as oi
the average worth of £314s. per ton, a gross value
of over twenty-live millions sterling (1); he esti-
mates that the cost of working, mining, and mill-
ing, including maintenance of mills, would not
exceed 13s. a ton, and at this rate he reckons the
net profit would be upwards of ten millions ster-
ling. ( 1111) In reference to the annual profits, he
states that, looking to the abundance of water on
the Lisbon Estate, there should be a net profit ot
£1400 per day (I), or £430,000 per year (I) of three
hundred working days, adding that this is based
upon employing one-half the water power, and
that if the whole were used the revenue would be
double. (II!) This would be from hydraulic work-
ing on the alluvial soil alone. With reference to
quartz-crushing with 450 (1) heads of stamps, he
says there would be a profit of £3840 a day, equal
to £853,000 per annum (I), allowing only 13dwts. of
gold to the ton of quartz and slate crushed to-
gether; the quartz alone running to many ounces
per ton. Mr. Stuart reports that he made a large
number of teste on the ground, the lowest
of which showed over 10 oz. to the ton. and
running up to about 1000 oz. per ton. (IIIIII)
The exclamation marks are our own. There is a
lot more palaver in the same splendid vein. In
fact, if the quartz-veins be anything like as
splendid, the thing will geo and no mistake. The
whole business is worked up no-end—a little bit ot
bathos, rendered necessary by the pestilent curi-
osity of possible subscribers, being carried off In
beautiful style. Thus : “ The present workings
only cover an area of about 30 acres (whoop . 80
acres out of 18,000). “which will give some idea of
how little”—the promoters have in the way ot
facte to go upon? not at all — * how little the mines
have been {exhausted I” This noble enterprize,
based on a 30-acre claim actually worked (for
that’s what it comes to), and the chances that
17980 acres around about will be as good. is placed
at £500,000, in £1 shares, of which 300,000 are ap-
propriated by the promoters in part payment ot
the properties. And before a day’s work has been
done, officers are engaged for a term of years, at
salaries exceeding, in some cases, £1000 per annum
per man, with a retiring pension, free passage, and
Lord only knows what. Baron Albert Grant is a
smart man, we rather think, and we feel anxious
about Nunky I
Within the last few weeks the case of
Valentine Baker has once more been thrust upon
the attention of an unwilling public. Yet another
agitation has been entered upon by a number of
those London journals, such as Punch, the World,
Vanity Fair, and the Whitehall Review,
which pander to the haw-haw element in society.
The latest idol which it has pleased them to raise is
Baker Pasha, whom they are seeking to pitchfork
back into the position he lost some ten years ago
bv his own heinous fault. The nature and circum-
stances of that fault, or rather crime, need no
recapitulation—they are as wel l known “ Baker
Pasha himself. Suffice it to say that an impartial
iurv found him guilty of a dastardly outrage
against a defenceless young lady in a railway car-
riage. He was sentenced to a term of imprison-
ment, and to pay a fine of £50°, tho mildness of the
sentence being explained by the fact that it was
an understood thing that he would be dismissed
Her Majesty’s service. Had the culprit been an
ordinary individual, without friends at Court,
and had he not occupied social position and mili-
tary rank, there is no doubt but that he would
have been condemned to penal servitude. As it
was, he was allowed to mitigate the just penalty
by payment of a fine, and to spend the short term
of his incarceration in the otium cum dignitate of
a first-class misdemeanant, which, alas I for the
purity of modern English justice, has become the
tpecial privilege of aristocratic or moneyed
' offenders. Now, this is the man for whom sym-
pathy is claimed, whose cruel fate is bemoaned by
Messrs. Burnand, Yates, Lawes, Bowles and Co.,
who declare that since he was cashiered and chased
from the pale of English society, Baker Pasha has
redeemed his reputation in the eyes of his country-
men and of the world. Let us see if this be so.
Having, as we have seen, escaped the Just punish-
ment of his crime, Valentine Baker betook him-
self to the more congenial climate of Turkey,
where, thanks to the easy virtues of the Turk, and
strong recommendation from a great personage at
home, he obtained service. The unwholesome
notoriety which he had attained to did not in any
way miligate against his success and popularity
on the Bosphorous. A tall, well-made, handsome
man, as he is, he found no difficulty in obtaining
the cntrie to the best of Levantine society on the
Golden Horn. During his stay at Constantinople,
he was to bo seen at all the balls, garden parties,
regattas, &c.—in fact, everywhere except at the
British Embassy, where, of course, he was not
admitted. He drew a handsome salary from the
impoverished Turks, like the other foreign officers
in the Turkish service, for doing nothing. Ho
kept up an elegant establishment at Prinkipo, one
of the most delightful situations on the Bos-
phorous; he maintained his yacht, and beguiled
the dolcefar niente of Turkish life by fishing, shoot-
ing, and riding. Those who saw him can tostafy
that the atmosphere and surroundings of the
Sultan’s Court and service suited him remarkably
well, and that in his daily life and bearing he be-
trayed none of those signs of deep humiliation
and mental suffering of which so much has been
said of late. He got command of a division in the
Russo-Turkish war, where he is said to have acted
the part of a hero, and t® have all but turned the
tide of victory against the Russian arms; though
we are bound to confess that we have never yet
seen one tittle of evidence to prove that he did
more than the other foreign officers who then
fought with the Turks. When he returned to Con-
stantinople, it is true he was made a Mmnir, which
is the highest grade of a Pasha, and equal to the
rank ef an English field-marshal. Decorations in
Turkey, however, prove nothing; money will buy
them, and the highest honour the Sultan has to
confer may be bought dirt cheap. When acrobats,
tumblers, and lion-tamers are decorated by the
Sultan with orders which secretaries to Embassies
are proud to wear, the average value of Turkish
decorations may be easily guaged. The revolt of
Arabi and the bombardment of Alexandria seemed
to open up new scenes of ambition, and to point
the way by which he could re-enter the charmed
circle of English society. The astute Turks, how-
ever, raised objections to their English Pasha
taking part in what the Sublime Porte considered
an attack upon Islam. But, as we have seen,
Baker Pasha is not a person easy to be put off;
what he cannot get by consent he deigns to take
by force. He took French leave, or, in other words,
deserted the Turks, who had received and shel-
tered him in his hour of need, and placed his sword
at the service of the English Government and the
Khedive. Desperate efforts were made to get him
appointed to the command-in-chief of the army ot
occupation after the battle of Tel-el-Kebir, but
the British authorities dared not, even though they
had wished, appoint him. The Khedive was less
obdurate, and gave him the command of the
newly-organised gendarmerie force. He has lately
been before the public somewhat prominently as
in command of an Egyptian force in the Soudan,
with which he was destined to play, after the un-
fortunate Hicks Pasha, the most melancholy r6le
in the campaign, when the troops under him were
butchered almost to a man by the Arabs at El Teb.
This, in brief, may be said to be the Public career
of Baker Pasha since he was dismissed the British
service. We fail to discover anything very brilliant
in it—certainly nothing to occasion that gush of
nublic sympathy which, if we are to believe certain
journals, has taken place in favour of a man who,
while holding high rank in the British army and
wearing the Queen’s uniform, attempted to out-
rage the chastity of a lonely and unprotected
voung lady. We repeat that, had he not belonged
to the “upper ten,” he would even now be expiat-
ing his crime in a convict prison. We can well
understand the kind of backstair influence by
which the gushes of maudlin sympa-thy in Punch
and kindred sheets has been evoked, and the un-
holy compact to reinstate a man who has been
justly chased from society, but it will not avail.
The British public will not allow a crime to be
made the stepping-stone to its sympathy. Indivi-
duals may forgive a personal offence, but law and
society are bound to see that the penalties provided
for such offences as Baker Pasha’s are enforced to
the uttermost. The pleas put forward by such jour-
nals as Punch, Vanity Fair, and the World are
as offensive as they are false. The former journal
pleads that Baker Pasha has been wounded under
the eye with a sharpnel shell, and that there is a
danger of erysipelas supervening, and, therefore,
concludes that “there is only one medicine that
should at once cure him of his mental and physical
wounds, and that is a message from England to
the effect that he was to have the mercy we all
nrav for. and that after these many years he was
tube restored to some position of some sort
amongst his comrades in arms. As a pendant to
this impudent bathos, we cannot refrain from
quoting one or two specimens from the World.
Tt savs- “The indignant matrons of England have
resolved themselves into a kind of informal jury.
Nice people have been defined as people
of 'nasty notions, and the outraged wives and
mothers who have written to the various editors
are animated by motives which may be compared
not altogether favourat ly with the instincts which
impel the shrieking sisterhood m totbemidstof
the C.D. Acts agitation. In addition to this
coarse and barefaced condonation of an offence
against female chastity, the same journal proceeds
to inform the public that the name of Valentine
Baker has been reinscribed on the roll of a London
club, and remarks: “The opinion of a London
c ub upon matters relating to social decency or
conduct is the highest, most trustworthy, and
most equitable expression of worldly Judgment
fnefe ” Cardinal Dubois explained his eleva-
tion Cardinalate and to the direction of affairs
bv quoting his favourite maxim: “ PouriUvvmr
a rand horn me il faut Stre grand sciUrat. This
infamous Minister, on being kicked five times by
the regent Orleans-once each for the rogue, the
pimp, the priest, the minister, and the archbishop-
coolly remarked “I pardon you. because I await the
sixth as Cardinal”; and he was not disappointed.
Although Baker Pasha’s “chums” seem to think
the contrary, the day for the promotion of rascals
is past: it is the present fashion to give them more
kicks than half-pence. It might be otherwise
were the expressions 6f “worldly judgment and
taste” and the opinions on “social decency’
emanating from London clubs allowed to guide us
fn our ideas of public morality and of the honour
and* 'chastity of woman. Wo speak now not of
clubs in general, because there are many clubs
which are the resorts of honourable gentlemen.
But there Is another class of clubs which have of
late vears become notorious as seminaries of
debauchery and gambling, and of vice of every
kind They are known to be the haunts of a
snecies of genteel blackguardism, wnich is all the
more dangerous that it covers Itself with a black or a
red coat, and seeks refuge in Piccadilly or the Mall .
q-ffiis is the class of establishment to which we
refer • and notwithstanding that they are numei-
ous, and can boast many very fashionable person-
aves amongst their members, they are not likely
?n becomef for the present, at least, the sources
from'which either the officers of the British army
or the British public generally will consent to
draw either maxims of honour or codes of morals.
Archibald Forbes is said to be “agtfner,”
both as far as his pocket and his health are con-
cerned. The gory battlefield floored the one, and
Yankee sharpness the other. Arohy, however, is
still just as egotistically vigorous at creating
archipelagos of “I’s” in his seas of copy, and
tlobbering at the feet of his darling “ uppan
suckles ” It would be interesting to know the
grounds on which Parkes wriggled Into the Com-
pany of authors,” unless the name of the club was
given on the lucus a nonlucendo principle......
A cablegram, which we believe to be a cable-
cram, asserts that the Fortescue has ob-

There is a very pretty quarr al between Dr. Eustace
1 Pratt, of Tamworth, and Dr. Creed, the editor of
the Australian Medical Gazette. Creed calls
Pratt a champion of Irregular practice. Pratt
bluffly declines to conform to the creed of the A.
M. Gazette. Each thinks the other’s “ prattle to
be tedious,” and as crude as that of *’a pagan
suckled in a creed outworn.” Possibly both are in
the right on that score Mr. Garnett, a Victorian
Crown prosecutor, recently failed to show up at
the General Sessions. The court consequently had
10 be adjourned, and two men in blue found Mr.
Garnett snoring comfortably in bed quite oblivi-
ous of the fact that there was a squad of prisoners
anxiously waiting to be sent up by his eloquence.

tent a few weeks after the discovery of that gold-
field, 33 years ago Political trimmers always
land the prizes. Casey’s elevation to the Victorian
bench is but another verification of this axiom.
Casey ail through his political career always sailed
with the prosperous breeze, so much so that it
became a standing joke that “ circumstances altar
Casey’s.” Henry J. Hart, one of Melbourne’s
oldest identities, hopped the perch last week....
One Garrick’s opinion of Archbishop Moran is that
he is a “ real hot member.” We yearn for Moran’s

The Autophone is a wonderful little Instrument,
which, while it weighs less then three pounds, has

effect.
It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three keys, and
all the parts of most difficult music.

tion, any of its music, which at present consists of
over 1300 selections from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas,
Waltzes, Polkas, Marches, Popular Songs, &c. It
is best adapted to the kind of music which suits an

f U n. We have laughed before, but this is
f H U flr=t time we ever had to sit on the edge ot our
bachelor and sew on buttons of a Sunday

We had the thread, also-that is, the
thlpad of the play running through our head,
while the needle was running through our thumb.
oorhaDS you would like to know something about
K C i thread of the play ? Well, in a nut-shell, or a
shuttle or something, it is simply as follows
is a Colonel Delmar in England (Mr. B. N.
Tines) who has a nephew, Lieutenant Leslie (Mr,
Jones), d aS0 n. Leon Delmar (Mr. Polk),
G v°o r ung country gentleman. The Colonel wants
M son to wed his niece. Blanche MTvor (Mrs.
puk) All this time the Lieutenant is desperately
love with Blanche. At length the soldiers
ia „J ordered away to the war in Arabia.
i Rn f ar ng we have read history,
np h ve^occurred. We suppose the reason that Mr.
Solk “■ot up a war between England and
Arihia g was because his last piece, An Arabian
’ w is 1 mgh id at by the English “Arabs” who
throigeu the pit. Afterthe Colonel and the
t ion tenant gone, Leon joins a Highland regiment,
L a crops away to the scene of action. By some
wvstorious agency known onlvto dramatic authors,
Sancheand her aunt, Mrs. M’Shane (Mrs. Bryer) are
transported to Arabia, and the fun, and smoke, and
battle begin. , * ,
Mr Polk, as the Colonel of Highlanders,
looked like “poor Brown.” We turned an opera
idass on him, just to see if his legs had been chafed
S hi a kilts They hadn’t. This is probably be-
plusfhehasn'thaaa “wet” lately His legs are
Snndsome, but w« don’t see any chance ot their
KgTanded down to posterity, unless he joins
the Koyal household, and takes a tramp through
Scotland in a rain-storm. And we didn t like to
«pb him fan Blanche with his spprran, waen she
fainted. No wonder the poor girl was so long
coming to.

We want D’Orsay Ogden (the Sultan) to
whiten his eyebrows to correspond withi hisi hair
ami heard. On that throne ho looked like a
Colorado beetle on a Gipi>sland pumpkin. And he
talks entirely too much for an old naan. He bears
a close personal resemblance to the man who
talked the hinges otf our landlady a hen-coop and
Btolo all her chicken*. We haven t looked in a
mirror since. Edwin Lester had a small part to
Xv but his costume and make-up were the most
Arabic we have seen since wo were held for ransom
amongst the savage tribes of Woolloomooloo in
tne province of Myra.

After reaching Arabia, Blanche is taken
nrisoner, and becomes a part of the royal house-
hold The Sultan gets awfully goue on her. and
the wav ho togged her out in short dresses and
iewels was simply magnificent. ® ut ,Jhe confine-
ment doesn’t suit either Blanche or Mrs. M Shane,
who is also a prisoner in the palace. So they take
S measles and break out This is the latest way
of getting out of gaol, and the easiest.
• • •
Another thing we want to know is, if all
the soldiers In that Arabian war were in the
habit of wearing patent leather shoes ? After all
the carnage and hard marching, the boots of the
entire outfit, Saturday night, were free from
stains of blood and dust, and their red uniforms
Showed none of the smudge of battle.

The interval between the second and third

Mr. George Forbes has played the Parson
in “ The Strategist” so long that he cant play
anything e'sc without being parson-uke. About
twn vears ago, we are told, Mr. Forbes
gllo I benefit to himself in which he played
MaUr Wellington de Bools and wore shoes.
George intended going to England on the
proceeds of the benefit. but he has never
gone The expenses of the entertainment
tooted up £40 even, and the takings at the door
amounted to £40 Is. (Id. Saturday night George
looked as though he was wondering whether ne
would ever see that Is. 6d. again. How he ever
got as far as Arabia is another one of the mysteries
of the niece By the way, everybody who has
seen “E wtward ho!” wonders why plf-an-Agan
(Harry Power) watches George so closely on the
stage We will explain. On a certain occasion
George got too “declamatory.’ Ibis was when
playing tha Parson, in “ The Strategist, to Harry 8
Terrence O’Flam, Being near-sighted, and ha ving
forgotten his eye-glass, George whoH it came ta
the ulace where he is supposed to knock Mr.
O Flam out of time, miscalculated the distance,
and actually biffed the Irishman in the eye. That
fs the reason Harry Power wore blue goggles
around town for a week, and that is also the reason
why te watches George very closely when the
eye-glass is out of his make-up.

Mr. Russell is a nice sort of fellow, but as
Sergeant Simpson he needs coaching. It doesn t
look well for instance, when a sergeant is handed a
despaTch to see him return the salute by smacking
the despatch against his helmet as though it hurt
his head and he wanted revenge. And he should
learn to step otl with the left foot first.
Mr. Jones’s voice seemed thick and husky.
"We suaneot the cause of this. Mr. Jones, you know,
Is staire manager at the Opera House, and the pro-
babilities are that he miscalculated quantity of
trine necessary to fit up the elaborate mounting ot
the new uiece and had to swallow the remaining
portion of It to keep Sam Genese from growling
about extravagance. Oh, yes! and we had almost
forgotten to mention Signor Bart°1 omeot1 1, who
got up the Qostumea and uniforms. Not that we
care anything' about who did the tailoring, but we
want to tell you a yarn about the Signor. As you
have already found, his surname is a very hard
one to handle, unless you have learned to drink
beer In seven different languages. He can’t pro-
nounce it himself, and the constant trying to do so
when a boy caused him to have an impediment In
his speech, and he grew up a stutterer. One day
after the passing of the Move-on-and-don t-
obstruct-the-corner Act, the Signor was stand-
ing in front of a well-known Sydney hos-
telry talking with a couple of actors, when
a policeman come up and told him to move
on. The Signor didn’t move right away, and the
constable demanded his name. “ B-b-b-b-Bar-Bar-
Barto-toe-toe-Barto!-toe-toe-toe.” He could get
no further, and the “trap,” thinking that Barto-
lomeotti was having a lark with him, ran him in,
and the Signor barely escaped reprimanding.

And now you want to know who wrote
the play. You thought we should have told
you that in the beginning. Well, to tell you the
truth, we couldn’t. As we went over the lines we
saw evidences of such a confusion of authors that
we have been cross-eyed ever since. But that
doesn't make any difference. “Eastward Ho!” is
a very fair play, but Mr. Polk will have to curtail
some of the long front scenes and soliloquies con-
siderably before it becomes a favourite with the
public. There is good material, but it is too long
drawn out. The scenery is of a high order of
merit, and was executed by Mr. Alfred Clint,
assisted by W. A. Wilson, junior, while the elabor-
ate mechanism is by Mr. Charles Lewis. The
mechanism of the last scene is particularly intri-
cate, and when the walls of the palace are fired
upon, the first cannon b ill knocked them all to
pieces, and the blocks of stone (?) totter and tumble
about in the wildest confusion. As we hinted
before, the only weak thing about this scene is
Mr. Polk’s bright uniform and spotless gaiters.
When he comes rushing in to take possession of
the palace, how much better he would look in
dingy uniform, head-gear missing, and hair flow-
ing wildly on the breeze. Then, too, his left-arm
should be blown off at the shoulder, and he should
rush in with the dismembered portion in his right-
hand, and bang the Sultan over the head with the
ragged end of it, just to make the scene look
truly war-like.

The “Silver King 1 ’ is still at the Theatre
Royal. Why he should stay so long, is a mystery.
One would think he had money enough to retire
from business, but ho still seems to want more.
We will give him a week’s salary of our own hard
earning if he will kindly withdraw and give us a
chance to write about something else. We have
got some Oriental bank-notes in our possession
that we want to get rid of any way. The thing
that pleases us most is that we worked off a few
on the Silver King on Saturday night By the
way, this burst-up has nearly ruined us. We had
organised a Minstrel troupe, and were to have
started overland for Woolloomooioo last Monday.
It it needless to say that the thousands we lost
have left us sad and shillingless. If we ever smile
again, it will bo when somebody requests us to
“put a label on it.” We shall never ask anyone to
“ nominate his poison ” after this.

Maggie Moore is still sustaining the part of
NoMe Denver with surprising cleverness, where
she keeps all the pathos she throws into the differ-
ent scene in which sue appears is one of those
things which “nofellah can find out.” “Com-
parisons are oderous,” as Mrs. Partington says, and
wc are not going to lift the roof off a perfumery-
factory by telling you why Maggie plays the role
better than But, therel We never open our
mouth without the risk of putting our foot in it.
That’s the disadvantage of having little feet and a
mouth like the fly-trap of a Queensland alligator.
And this reminds us of the flist introduction we
ever had to an alligator. It was on the banks of
the Alabama River, years ago, when we were
young 1 and fond of travel. We had been out hunt-
ing, and stopped to cook some game for dinner.
Under what looked like a log lying in the sand we
scooped out a hole and started a Are with hemlock
sticks. Then wo sat down on the log to wait for
the billy to boll Presently the log began to move
slightly, but we attributed this to the vioration of
the billy. Being fatigued, we were just dozing off
to sleep, when there was a fearful upheaval, and
with a roar that made the canebrakes quake,
the tail of that aroused alligator came sweeping
around and struck us just where it would do
the mo«t good, lifting us about thirty feet into the
boughs of a tree. We shall never forget how that
alligator hopped around that tree on three legs,
bellowing like a mad buffalo and scratching his
grilled side with the remaining foot. But we are
digressing, or lying, or something, and had better
return to the play.

We should like to be behind the scenes at
the Chequers Hotel when Parkyn (Mr. H. Seaton)
is giving that long description of the first time he
saw the death sentence passed, for the entertain-
ment of Wilfred Denver. About the time ho got
along to when the candle went “ drip 1 drip 1
drip I” we should throw a cat at him and burst up
the solilloquy. How he gets through it without
being teased into a laugh by the other members o
the troupe is more than wo can guoss-and we are
good at guessing. One time we guessed where our
mother hid the Christmas cake. Then we guessed
wo would have some. Presently our mother
guessed who had been tampering with the pastry.
Then she organized a small company to play the
touching drama of “Mother and Sou.’ 'there
were only three actors in the cast —a woman, a boy
and a slipper. We played the part of the boy, and
our mother plied the slipper. You can guess how
the thermometer went up that day. But the
play—“The play’s the thing wherein we’ll catch
the conscience of the 4 Silver King ’ If he has
any.

Harry Leston, as the tipsy passenger on
the way to “ Qlas-ga,” continues to be a great
favourite. We are reminded just here that the
stage Irishman is always on a spree. Playwrights
seem to think that the only way to get any fun
out 6)f Pat Is to get him drunk. Pat, no doubt, is
sorry that the whole world are not playwrights;
and we, in turn, are sorry that we are not Irish.
If we only were, we should cultivate the acquaint-
ance of every aspiring playwright who came
along. Old Jaikes (Mr. Philip Day) is so hysteri-
cally funny that the audience are convulsed with
laughter at one moment, and ready to shed tears
the next. His acting is really the work of a master
whose cleverness was not acquired in a day. so
natural does he appear as an aged and warm-
hearted servant, that you wouldn t know him if
you saw him in the street. We don’t know where
Messrs. Jones and Herman could have found the
original from which they created the likeness of
Jaikes. They must have imagined him, for we don t
believe that such a faithful old butler ever lived on
earth. The one we grew up to know and to fear
wasn’t a bit like Jaikes. You couldn’t have any
fun with our butler. If we bent a pin and put it
where he usually sat down, he would get up and
hunt for us. And ono night, when we put a
branch of hedge-thorn under the sheets of his bed,
he went howling about and got us licked. Ever
since that, when we see a butler, our malice begins
to assert itself, and we want to load him with gun-
powder and run a red-hot poker down his throat.
There are a lot of other people in the
“Silver King” that we could talk about if we
wanted to, but we are anxious to get as far away
from the “ Madding Crowd ” as possible, so we
will leave them to their fate. Oh, by the way, we
have been told that the “ Silver King ” is to be
withdrawn before long, and “Impulse put on
instead. This will probably result in a scattering
of the present cast, as there will be nothing for
many of them to do in the new piece. For this we
shall be sorry. Not that we care a flg about them,
but they have been here so long in the same piece,
that it is like parting with a dying relative, who
hasn’t a shilling to leave you, to see them go away
unhung. * * * *
And we went lo the Kennedy’s, the other
night. You have noticed the portrait on this
page? Well, that’s one of them. In fact, that is
the premier of the combination. We never saw
such an audience in the Protestant Hall before.
Every last man of them looked as though he had
been born with a mouthful of porridge, and had
spent his increasing years throwing the caber and
sinaring psalma, «r blowing through the wrong
end of a bag-pipe. It is a popular opinion, that we
mean to cryetalise into words, that Scotchmen are
brought up on oatmeal porridge and the Shorter
Catechism, or else cat-meal porridge and the cat-
echism. This maybe true to an extent, but we
knew a Scotchman over in America who was
brought up on a charge of murder. And this
reminds us of another man who was arrested over
in Colorado for eating a sheep's head. It wasn t
his sheep, to be sure, but. aside from that, they
w°re arresting everybody over In Colorado that
year. You couldn’t even kill a man without being
annoyed by a summons. It got so bad, after a
while, that you would have thought yourself in
Ireland, where they arrest me t 01 i U'picion—sus-
picion of being hungry.
• • "
We are not going to talk much about the
ladies in the audience, but we will say that they
would have been very good looking only for their
faces. And teeth I Great Cfesar. don’t mention
it. Every other one of .them looked as tnough it
had been balancing chairs or travelling with a
circus. But you want to know something about
the singing? You have seen at once, perhaps,
that we are not a society reporter. Well, the
songs were all right, but you would have to learn
them before you could appreciate harmony. All
went very well until the old man undertook
to take high B flat. He couldn’t do It. So Miss
Helen rushed in to the rescue. She got the note
in a corner, and pounded the life out of it.
Then Thomas ru«hed in and pulled its tail. At
last Miss Marjory caught it by the hair and pulled
it behind the curtain and sat down on it. We
have long wondered at the gallant charge of the
Black Watch at Tel-el-Kebir. We now know all
about it. When the bagpipes got between the
Watch and the Guards, and struck high B., the
Watch had to move somewhere. They couldnt
escape to the rear, for the Guards were behind
them and the bagpipes. So they made the pest of
it, and rushed on the enemy, the pipes following
close in the rear, to drive them desperately on.
That’s how Tel-el-Kebir was won.
• • •
You have observed the portrait of which
we spoke. That was taken just as the old gentle-
man was trying to take B flat. You might think
he was calling sheep, or cooeying tor a haggis.
Maybe you think he is weeping over the Ewie
wi’ the crookit horn.” He’s not. He s singing,
and if you don’t go to see him before the end of
this week, you’ll never again have an opportunity
of hearing him sing in Australia. And let us tell
you, his singing is a grand sight. You can hear
the young ladies best with an opera-glass.
# ♦ ♦ ♦
What about the Minstrels ? Well, we went
again, only last nigbt, and found another change
of programme. We don’t know exactly who is to
blame for this constant change at the Academy,
but we do know that the public like it. If it is
Smythe’s doing, we can’t help it, for Smythe is the
man who sends us a pass or two about fourteen
times a week; but, if it is Lou. Braham, theie II be
trouble, for we’ll blow him higher than some of
the notes he reaches in his solos. Oh, yes; and
Mr. Braham sang a new song last night, enutiea
“ Wake us at dawn.” It beats all what a mockery
life is, anyway. Now we know from personal
observation that Mr. Braham never gets up before
11 o’clock in the, morning, and he wouldn t «et up
then only his stage-managing duties compel him
to. Fancy him singing “ Wake us at dawn. lx
anything but a cry of fire outside his door should
do that, there would be trouble in the house right
away. But, after all, we haven t much fault to
find with the changes at the Academy, only
they make us think of °“ r , bick. Wo have
the funniest luck of anybody in the world.
For a long time we have real bad luck. Then
all at once a change will come, and it gets
worse than ever. Braham’s changes are alto-
gether different, and that is what makes us think
about our own affairs. The “ association of ideas
is so big in our head, that wo never see anything
that it doesn’t make us think of something else.

PEPPER AND SALT.
Lieutenant-Colonel Brownrigg delivered
a lecture to the militia in the East Melbourne
orderly room, a week ago, and its tenor, together
with its effect on the minds of the men, was of
unique significance. Among the general public
who had been accorded permission to attend, there
were, disguised of course, a Zeitxtkg special and a
Temps special, so that it is useless for Australians
now to think that the subject-matter of the lecture
can be kept dark. The Lieutenant-Colonel’s topic
was “Tactics.” No subject carries so many in-
sidious meanings as “Tactics,” but when taken in
connection with Brownrigg and the new militia,
the theme climbed to a tableland on which mys-
tery and wonder have their abodes. The look in
Brownrigg’s eyes was a sensational volume with
yellow covers and thirty full - page wood-
engravings, while the look in the men’s eyes
was a whole library of Newgate entertainment-
The Lieutenant-Colonel asked “ What advantages
have artillery over infantry ?” He did not answer
presently. He gave time for the question to affix
Itself to the hoarding of the men’s intellects.
Meanwhile he wiped his mouth with a white hand-
kerchief. Then ho said “ They can shoot farther.’’
That was a point. The Zeituno man and the
Temps man were profoundly interested. Then he
asked “How many guns should the men have? ’
He paused again, and the interest was increased
when he answered “Depends entirely on the num-
ber of men.” Then he asked “ How far from the
enemy should the guns be posted?” The interest
culminated at this stage, and the nervous twitching
of the foreigners’ fingers as they held themselves
ready to dash down the momentous reply, showed
that France and Germany would soon be in posses-
sion of the invaluable Information. Brownrigg
drew himself up to his full height and, wiping his
mouth a second time, said “ That depends on their
calibre. If they can shoot only five yards, then,
that’s the distance; but if they can kill a thousand
miles off, then that’s the distance.” It is not easy
to over-rate the advantage to Australia of such
practical information as this. But should not the
audience be more carefully selected? Why should
foreigners be allowed to skim the cream off the
gallant Brownrigg’s brains and send it in sealed
jugs to people who may yet be o«r enemies. Why
should they?
A CURE FOR COMPETITION.
A CAPITAL IDEA.
Competition, in all ages—
E’en since labour first began—
Has been cutting down the wages
Of the worthy working man:
Then we ask you, plainly, whether
’Twouldn’t better this condition
If we pulled ourselves together
And suppressed all competition ?
’Gainst this fearful growing evil
Let us bravely take a stand,
Or ’twill play the very devil
With this fair Australian land;
“ Labour ” ought to be the master,
But it loses its position
When it moves a little faster
At command of Competition.
So our duty to our neighbour
As Luscombe plainly proves,
It consists in keeping labour
In the good, old-fashioned grooves;
Then ’twere wisest for the nation
To adopt our proposition—
Namely, keep down population,
For increase means Competition.
Sad news, this. An English paper received
by the last mall states that Colonel Sir R. Caven*
dish Spencer Clifford, the Yeoman Usher of the
Black Rod, is dead. It is well for John Brown
that he is in glory, or he might have been much
vexed at this occurrence. Sir Cavendish should
have been proud to meet Death. Death and he
were both Ushers of the Black Rod. All we can
contribute to hi® memory is an epitaph
On vulgar paths he did not plod;
He was no common, toiling clod.
Brought into life to hump a hod,
Or tramp the streets, with feet unshod,
And shake at a policeman’s nod.
In royal corridors he trod;
His body lies beneath the sod,
From which, just like a pea from pod.
His soul is shelled (how deuced odd!)—
Don’t judge it with the common squad,
But bear in mind he was, 0 God,
The Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod!
There; that is all wo can do for him. If his friends
want more, they had better apply to Lord Tenny-
son. His muse is more expert at a “ melodious
moan” than ours. Ours, we regret to say, is apt
to degenerate from the elegiac into the hilarious,
under the influence of strong feeling—and other
things. This may be accounted for by the differ,
ence in the quality of the inspiration. Lord
Tennyson grieves on gin—we grieve on what we
can get: which is anything, from rum to hair-oil.
This variety of liquors may give versatility to our
verse, but is fatal to harmoniousness of effect.
For instance, we are hopeful on hair-oil, and rise
to a spiritual rapture on rum; but we grow de-
spondent and gloomy over diluted tobacco-juice.
As we are on this subject, we may state that there
is no truth in the rumour that Lord Tennyson has
raised the price of his poetry since he was made a
Peer. Cash customers are still supplied at the
same old figure. Elegies ready at a day’s notice.
No menial below the rank of footman immortal-
ised. Commissions to be accompanied with Post-
office orders or stamps, otherwise no notice taken.
This is the way to do it. But wait till you see us
when we go into the poetry business in earnest.
There will be no superfine fastidiousness about
us. Our muse will be ready to wrestle with any-
thing, from a tram-engine to a tarantula. We only
draw the line at snakes.

The new chum may read this paragraph
with some profit. A man went into the office of a
Sandhurst ironfounder the other day, and asked
whether he knew him. The ironfounder replied
in a prompt negative. The stranger then told him
that he was a man whom he (the ironfounder) had
met on the Newland bridge in Cornwall, and had
casually advised to go to Australia, where he
would find plenty to do. He came to return
thanks for the advice, “ for we quote the local
paper—“although hs has been only six months in
the colony, and arrived with only £5 in his pocket
he is now a partner in a firm dealing in produce’
the profits of which are £500 per week.” How
much of a partner he did not say. Probably to
the extent of what in the vegetable line he could
reach with a boat-hook when the night was dark
and the yard-dog was asleep. But there is no tell-
ing. We knew a man who started in business with
six-penn’orth of rock-powder and an old flint-gun.
He was a partner in several firms—mostly at night,
too. He died worth a good deal of money. The
predecessor of Mr. Robert Howard was very fond
of him, and stood by him till the last. Pride, of
course, will have a fall. He had a fall of six feet f
or thereabouts. We trust this little anecdote will
convince those who doubt the capabilities of this
country that a little enterprise is ail that is neces-
sary here to make a rapid fortune. If we have
made one young man turn his attention from
tract-reading and Sunday-schools to burglary and
horse-stealing, we shall be content. There will
always be a chance of his being hanged, and we
can manage to get a ticket for the show. It is
pleasant to have some amusement to look for-
ward to. W e intended this paragraph to be cheer-
ing to the new chum. We hope it is.

Attend to this. We hope the people who
talk of the want of culture in the colonies wllj
disguise themselves [in liquor when they read the
following. It is from a New Zealand paper. Now :
—“The principal business transacted at the last
fortnightly meeting of the Mangapai Mutual
Improvement Society was a dog-fight.” But this
is nothing. At a meeting of a Mutual Improve-
ment Society in one of our own suburbs the lead-
ing debater “ plugged ” the president for differing
from him in regard to the relative merits of Milton
and Dante. The other members of the society
took sides. After a brief exchange of pugilistic
repartee, the ringleaders of both parties adjourned
to the lock-up. It is pleasant to think that there
is so much enthusiasm among our young men
over literary matters, and that there is such ready
appreciation In guardians of the peace. Both the
Milton and Dante champions wore beef on their
eyes for a week afterwards. After this, we trust
that we shall hear no more about the rising
generation of the colonies lacking culture.

A gentleman dwelling at Winburndalc—
wherever that may be—lately discovered a beau-
tiful specimen of petrified wood, fifteen feet
under the ground. He is going to forward it to the
Sydney Museum. Perhaps it is a portion of the
head of a prehistoric alderman. This is a varia-
tion of an old joke made by Sydney Smith. But
that is no matter—aldermen have not changed
B'nce his time. A certain percentage of citizens
in every generation seem to be specially con-
structed to fill Town Councils. And it is fair to
suppose that they were just the same in pre-
historic times. But nature is more generous with
the timber now-a-days.

“frost" poor Moncure Conway proved, with his
third-hand philosophy, we must make a little
allowance for the disappointed sage when he sums
us up:—“After due allowance for the many indi-
vidual exceptions, it is to be feared that the two

absorbing occupations of the average Englishman
(according to Matthew Arnold)—making money
and saving his soul—prevails to such an extent at
the antipodes, as to enfeeble the forces that tend
to build a high civilisation and a beautiful society.”
Even here, you see, our old friend had to draw
upon the Intellect of another man (whose lectures,
by the bye, are just about as lively as Moncure’s)
In order to express his spite. Yet we fancy he
pretty nearly hit the mark, don’t you know.
A PHILOSOPHIC DOGQKEL.
There came a party called Moncure,
To lecture In Australia—
Wherein his lectures, to be sure,
Were somewhat of a failure;
So, now that he has gone away,
It scarcely is surprising
That poor Moncure should sadly say
We all want civilising.
But though, when here, Moncure did not
Call forth our admiration
(We even thought his lectures “rot”),
His recent observation
Is pretty clever, on the whole:
It’s venom we forgive—for

Is all some people live for.
Dry humourists, the South African
journalists. Most journalists are dry. But this
by the way. An explosion took place at Kimberly
the other day. The local paper, in speaking of it,
says: “ Three persons were killed and others were
missed.” There is an airy ease about this way of
dismissing the question which is particularly re-
freshing. If the explosion had taken place here,
the Evening News would have been full of lugu-
brious details about where the fragments were
found, and how many baskets they filled, with
other abattoir realism. But the South African
Journalist simply says they were missed,” which,
when we come to think of it, may account for the
late Increase of spots in the sun.

Thanks to Sir ’Enry, red sunsets, small-pox
scares, &c., Australia is slowly but surely becoming
tolerably well-known to the rest of the civilised
world in general. Only the other day, Barnum
engaged a troupe of Cooktown niggers to sling
sticks and otherwise educate the masses and diffuse
Intelligence through the Hail Columbian land of
pop-corn and presidents, and here’s the style of
par. that is going the rounds of the U.S. In conse-
quence: “A party of native Australians, boome-
rang-throwers, arrived here last evening, and be-
fore morning one of them died. The American
climate proved too much for him. The party are
members of a man-eating tribe of natives. It was
reported that they tried to make a breakfast of
their dead companion. This is denied, however,
by the man having them in charge. He says they
only attempted to lay him out according to the
custom of their tribe by shaving off the hair,
tying the arms across the breast, and the legs
under the body.” The only fault we have to find
with that par. is that, from the jump to the finish,
it happens to be a plain, undiluted lie. In all other
respects, it is perfectly trustworthy. Australian
blacks do not eat each other now. Chinamen are
far too plentiful.

Slightly psychological this time. Most
poets we have known have inherited the poetical
faculty from the maternal side. From the mother
comes tenderness and delicacy of sentiment. She
gives to the young genius everything but a voice.
We have an instance at our hand. An exchange—
the Illawarra Mercury— contains a poem by
Melinda Kendall. This lady is the mother of our
dead singer. The poem is in memory of her son.
She says:—
“ He was born at the foot of the mountain,
He was taught his first letter in sand;
His companions-mimosas and gum-trees,
And the beautiful birds of our land.
“ To his ear the wild scream of the curlew
Was sweeter than sweetest of flutes;
And the silvery tinkling of bell-birds
More soothing than fair ladies’ lutes ”
This is not a very high class of poetry, but it is
interesting on account of its subject and on ac-
count of its authorship. Further on, the mother
says:—
“ But at last, he is quietly sleeping,
And the present will soon.be the past;
If this thought can bring comfort In sorrow,
All wrong will boi righted at last.”
And concludes with:—
“ And from thence, like another Elijah,
His mautle on earth he may cast,
To be worn by a second Elisha.
Who will write his grand epic at last.”
We wonder who this will be ? But, of course —D-

Gentlemen, you will excuse us for a
moment if we indulge in a muffled laugh. Thanks.
The paroxysm is over—we can now tell you what
we were laughing at. But, read for yourselves—
it is a Melbourne telegram published in the dally
papers:—“The recent allegations of blackmailing
against the members of the police have resulted in
the removal of some to positions beyond the possi-
bility of receiving bribes.” Now, what does this
mean ? As far as we can understand, it must mean
that certain members of the force have be?n
secretly beheaded or removed to the cemetery.
We can hardly imagine any other place where they
would be “beyond the possibility of receiving a
bribe.” And then ? By thunder, of course. The
sound of a trumpet will never wake a dead police-
man. It wouldn't wake a living one, Gabriel
will just have to go around and jingle a half-crown
on the tombstone of every departed member of
the foorce, and the trumpeting will be superflu-
ous. And then we shall not be surprised if some
of them take a bribe to keep out of Hell. Wo
hope they will, anyhow.
There is a happy couple at present living
in the town of Wellington (N.Z.) whose connubial
eccentricities furnish a feast of enjoyment to their
delighted neighbours all the year round. They
own between them two nice little cottages, in one
of which they are frequently seen together luxu-
riating in the sweetest domestic bliss Imaginable.
The other cottage they hold In reserve against
contingenoies: nothing in the shape of rent can
tempt them to part with it even for a week.
Although this couple have been married for many
years, they may be seen for a week or two at a
time, billing and cooing and making love to each
other, as if their honeymoon were only in the first
quarter. Suddenly, however, and without any dis-
coverable cause, comes a change; and, all at once,
they begin to fight and make the feathers fly, like
a pair of young roosters struggling viciously for
supremacy. On these ocoaslonsjthe language used
on;both sides, on reaching a climax, has been known
to startle a passing bullock-team into sudden and
disastrous activity. Whenthestorm hassomewhat
abated, the wife wrathfully packs up her belong-
ings and carries them into the other cottage, where
she proceeds to make herself comfortable, leaving
the old man to cook his dinner in the slop-bucket,
or go without. Occasionally the war is renewed
in a spasmodic way from their separate forts, and
old boots, dead rats, and other missiles may be seen
flying over the fence from the one cottage to the
other at irregular intervals all day between sun-
rise and evening. Then, for several days together,
there is a dead calm. The separation continues,
but hostilities are at an end—the window-blinds
are down in both cottages, and the neighbours
begin to wonder whether the combatants are still
alive, when all at once some fine morning they
behold the happy pair once more living together
in the enjoyment of the most exquisite domestic
bliss, recalling the lines of the poet Burns where
he sings—
“ Oh, happy life, where love like this is found 1
Oh, heartfelt raptures—bliss beyond compare!”

The Duke de Morny, notorious for his
shameful treatment of the beautiful young Rus-
sian Feyghine, and for his lascivious life in general,
is now engacod to Miss Rothschild, the daughter
<>f Baron Alfred. She was engaged before, to
James Gordon Bennett, the millionaire proprietor
of the N.Y. Herald. The young Duke has just
been dreadfully shown up in a novel on the lines
of “ Sara Barnum,” which moral work, by the way,
is now sold by several Sydney booksellers, but the
translation, although gross enough, is not a circum-
stance to the original. The Duke's father was
bastard son of the Comte de Flahaut and Queen
Hortense, mother of Napoleon III. The latter,
however, was born in wedlock, but was universal-
ly believed to have been not the son of his putative
father, Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland, but of
a Dutch General. So that in reality the Prince
Imperial, respecting whose death John Brown and
his circle were so troubled, had in all probability
not a drop of Bonaparte blood in his veins, and
was a “cock-tail” of no recognisable breed or
strain. Hortense was a notable Faustina.

The eucalyptus is a curious tree. It pushes
Its roots long distances under the ground to find

It Is in truth very green. Well-diggers never drink

by itself. Some people call water a blessing. Well-
diggers do not care for an unmixed blessing. We

so long as the lines of military discipline are not
those of the British service, than which nothing
can be conceived more utterly unsuited for the
control of troops of a practically democratic com-
munity. The “lines” that should be followed are
those of Switzerland or France.
Story of Major Smith of Ballarat. “I

An essayist writes an article in a New
Zealand paper on ‘ Mis-spent Time.” As an
Illustration of his theme, the article is a great
success. And by the time the reader has got
through it, he thoroughly understands what mis-
spent time means. In this respect the article is
very much like some of those that appear in our
own daily papers. There is only this difference —
the latter do not give fair warning before they
begin. Hence the growing Increase in homicide.
We were very nearly being run over by a
tram the other day. If we had stayed on the line
this catastrophe would certainly have come off;
but we didn’t. One of our golden rules of life is
never to quarrel with a tram. The incident, how-
ever, made us think of sudden deaths. After a
good deal of thinking, wo came to the conclusion
that the most ignominious of deaths is to be run
over by a hearse. Curious thing, death. A dead
man is looked upon with suspicion if he asks for a
drink.
No wonder the Japanese are so progressive.
A lady living in Hlogo gave birth to five children

tokens of esteem, he would be in gaol by this time:

example of the difference between Eastern and
Western ideas.
When the veteran veterinary M.L.C., John
Stewart, tells us thdt nobody is a bit the better
for the University lectures except the University
professors, we can’t help thinking that he ex-

the other hand, the gushing Dailey tells us that ,
the evidences of the culture of even a few of the
graduates of Sydney University may be seen in
our institutions—in our Courts and in our Parlia-
ments—in the universal dignity dnd refinement of
our public life— we can't help teellng that he too is
an exaggerator, and of the two by far the grosser
and more dangerous.
lu the published details of the inspectoral
investigation Into the truth of an allegement that
teacher Gallagher of the Grown-siroet Public
School was in the habit of getting drunk and had
been arrested for drunkeness, occurs the following
statement of the assistant teachers:—“ Wo hereby
certify that we have never seen Mr. Gallagher of
this school under the influence of liquor, nor, up
to the time of the inquiry relative to him, have we
heard that he has been so, that is while in connec-
tion with this school.—J. If. Crosby, First Assis-
tant; T. N. Hall, Peter D. M'Cormick, James
Donohue.” We take it that there is something
maddeningly unkind In the “ that Is while in con-
nection with this school.”
Premier Service wires to “Beaconsfleld
Conservative Association,” re miniature fleet
offered to English Government when lately hard

of”&c. &c. Assuming that the English Govern-
ment had got into a difficulty, which was the only
raison d'ttre of the oblation of naval vignettes,
the wire is suggestive of the Hibernian eutangle-
ment of sentiment, “It is with the greatest pleasure,
ma’am, I condole with ye in your sad bereave-
ment ” Service is not Hibernian, but perhaps
that is why his sentences only indifferently express
his meaning and only barely suggest a joke.
Pretty well everyone knows, of course,

It was at an important meeting of a certain civic
eiuncil, and Alderman O’Konnock, holding up a
citizen’s note, observed: “ Inper-roosln’ thisdocu-

and thin he dellblrtly insults the prlsint assimbly

Alderman Skeen trod on the mayor’s favourite
core, and the Mayor winked accordingly.
Mr. Booth, who for some years had charge of
the ostriches at the Murray Downs station, told the
subjoined yarn the other day to the Victorian
Acclimatisation Society:—" Upon two occasions, I
observed an eaglehawk at an old nest, here there
were four or five eggs. One egg was broken, and
a limestone pebble the size of a pigeon's egg, was
lying beside it, besmeared with yolk. I removed
the ston* and broken egg, and watched the eagle.
He returned and broke another egg with another
stone, but whether he dropped it or used it in his
beak as a hammer I could not make out.” This
action of the eaglehawk with regard to the ostrich
eggs is somewhat analogous to that of A. G. Taylor,
with regard to the nice-Iaid schemes of Ministers.
He comes around with a pebble in his beak and
perpetrates a mischievous smash with his exceed-
ingly hawk ward tactics, as poor Reid is only too
painfully aware.
If avoirdupois weight goes for anything
in the matter of a “conversion,” then Major
Barker has secured a real prize in Mrs. Whay Fook,
from the Chinese camp at Maryborough. Mrs.
Fook, in fact, represents some twenty-two stone
of repentance, and a largo number of Christians,
at sixpence a head, assembled at a Melbourne
“ barracks ” to hear this plump lady “ testify.”
Much to the disappointment, though, of an
audience that had paid their money and expected
some fun for it, poor Mrs. Whay Fook collapsed
under the ordeal, and was only able to “ testify ”
copious tears into her pocket-handkerchief. Pos-
sibly she was upset at finding how the Harmy had
“ got at her,” and—remembering that the “ fat
lady ” at a country fair is merely expected to walk
round, and shake hands with visitors—resented the
idea of Ibeing called upon to make a speech re-
specting the state of her soul.
Mrs. Stephen Murphy conceives her hus-
band has sustained a wrong at the hands of the
officials of the Supreme Court in its equity juris-
diction, and with a fine feminine persistency she is
constantly bearding the Primary Judge with the
foolish feminine concoction that there is some
occult relation betwixt Judges and justice, and
she won't be choked off. Said Primary Judge
Manning to her last week, “I advise you to be
careful, or you will find yourself in a lunatic
asylum ” Now, we take exception to these words,
straight out. A lunatic asylum isn’t a penal estab-
lishment, and oughtn’t to be held out by a Judge
as it were in terrorem over a woman with a griev-
ance. If she is guilty of wrong, threaten her with
punishment, if you like, Mr. Justice Manning, but
do not bounce her with reference to lunatic asy-
lums, since either she is sane and so deserving (if
guilty of contempt) of punishment for contempt,
or insane and so more fit to be a recipient of the
Supreme Court’s compassion than its brusqueness.
“ Is this never to end ? Is life to be all

then, settle down to chill penury for ever and
watch the State importation of labour, when what
we want is not labour but repose ? Why should
the Gov’ment bring ’em in in ship-loads to crowd

long does the Gov’raent think we—the original
owners of the soil and the benches—are to sit here
and see the bread taken out of our mouths as it
were? How long — ?” “Move on,” said a blue
man. “ Move on I” roared the Doraalnar, stuffing
a newspaper round the same old toe, and shoving
a piece of sausage in his hat; “yes, it s time to

and walked thoughtfully over and borrowed a
match from a man reading the Herald, and was
shortly after seen to fall prostrate, and foam out
“ To trie morgue, to the morgue!” “ What is it ?”
gasped the stranger, lifting him up, and losing his
watch and knife. “Nothing, nothing,” he sobbed,

The old hats who have charge of the
Sabbath in the South are full of uneasiness and
anxiety. Satan has become unusually active.
Whether this is on account of Peter Campbell
hiving left the ministry, or on account of Mrs.
Whey Fook, weighing 316 lbs., having joined it
does not appear. But he’s kicking up, anyhow.
In one week he inspired the licensed victuallers to
go to Berry and plead for Sunday grog-selling; he
Inspired Signor Coy and Mrs. Summers to start
Sunday amusemen.s in the Theatre Royal; he
inspired Signora Coy, Mrs. Cutter, and Miss Nellie
Veltch, the innocent little mountain maid, to do
the same; and he travelled up Collins street and
button-holed each member of the Ministry and
whispered an inspiration about the vacant seats
on the Board of the Public Library. The old hats
knew him and slated him in the persons of the
licensed victuallers; knew him and slated him in the
persons of the operatic vocalists; and knew him,
but could not, alas, slate him, in the persons of the
members of the Government, and the Board of the
Public Library has now a majority of confessed
Sabbath-breakers. Anxious times, anxious times!
Oscar Wilde.
Oscar Wilde, whose portrait adorns our
first page, has just been gettiug married. We will
wager a drink or two that he won t have so much
hair on his head a twelvemonth hence. This re-
minds us of the first time we saw Oscar Wilde.
It was in Denver, Colorado. IT. 8. A. while
we were round that way, Oscar was billed
by one of the local clubs to lecture in the Opera
House there for the benefit of that club. On the
day Oscar was to arrive, Eugene Field, the humour-
ist of the Denver Tribune, went down the road
as far as Pueblo to meet him. Oscar had missed
the train; so Mr. Field, being about the same size,
got a long curly wig and a fur-lined ulster, and
came back on the train, representing that msthetic
celebrity. The committee met him at the station
with a carriage, and drove him about town to let
him see the place before taking him to his
hotel. Everybody stuck their heads out of the
windows, and said “ There he goes 1 That’s Oscar
Wilde I See how he lolls about the carriage I”
Finally, “ Oscar ” requested to be driven to the
office of the Denver Tribune, as he wanted to
speak with his friend Eugene Field. When the
carriage reached the office door, a crowd of six or
seven hundred people gathered in no time.
“ Oscar*' got up, pulled off his hat and wig, bowed
to the committee men, threw a kiss to the crowd,
and leaped from the carriage. As we had to leave
town that evening, this was the only opportunity
we ever had of seeing Oscar Wilde

Points
The Mudgee Independent declares that
the premier constituency has set covetous eyes on
the Giraffe. Who could have inspired our contem-
porary with this notion ?

As long as he likes—against Time ?
Sir Henry Brougham Loch, says the Bris-
bane Courier, is‘‘a man of commanding aspect,
and is connected by marriage with several noble
English families.” Now that ought to be good
enough for a young colony like Victoria ; the
“aspect” arid the “ready speech” don’t go tor
much, but being “connected by marriage with
noble families ” ought to endow a man with every
qualification for the position of Governor. We
say it ought to.
The Whitehall Review remarks that
“ we all know how easy it is to construct a charge
of obstruction out of the most legitimate opposi-
tion. Even the public are beginning to see that
‘obstruction’ is acquiring the meaning which, in
former times, used to attach to the word ‘ debate.’
Everything which tends to retard the progress of
a measure distasteful to any section of the House
is stigmatised as obstruction.” Members of our
own Assembly should commit this to memory.
The first Napoleon s theory, that Provi-
dence usually fought on the side of the biggest
battalions, is utterly scouted by the Melbourne
D.T. Speaking of General Gordon, the piety
paper remarks: “The part he is playing shows
that, even amongst the barbarous tribes of the
desert, moral forces are mightier than the forces
which are purely material. Gordon’s bare story
refutes decisively all materialistic theories of
human nature and human history.” Seeing that,
according to latest advices, Gordon is still closely
besieged in Khartoum, we fail to perceive the
force of the D.T.’s argument, and must, for the
present, continue to stand Nap.
The G undag ai Bailey thus gushed in
behalf Tof Watson:—“Mr. Watson stands as far
above the petty crowd of detractors that assail
him, in probity and political ability, as the moon
does above the noisy pack of curs that its refulg-
genco provokes into making night hideous with
their discordant cries. Not one of the cowardly,
mean aspersions cast upon him by his sneaking
adversaries can be proved, or ever will be proved.
He has succeeded, and that is the crime that lashes
the envy of his assailants into fury.” To a certain
extent we agree with this rapturous gush. Watson
“has succeededin proving himself a political
failure of the first magnitude. As for his probity,
we never sampled it.
Here is a little story of the way they
manage things in India that will delight the soul
of a bureaucratic Under Secretary (wo quote Sir
J. Caird’s “ India”)" A vill ge which claimed to
pay not more than 1000 rupees as its fixed perma"-
e it assessment, on the ground of a sunnud of a
former ruler, was visited by the collector, who, on
inquiry, thought himself entitled to disregard the
alleged sunnud, and to put the assessment up to 4000
rupees. The village appealed to the courts, and
a decision was given in its favour, against which
the eollectbr appealed to a higher court, and was
again defeated. Upon this, Government, being
beaten in its contention, passed a resolution that
such cases in future should not be tried by the
judicial court, but by the revenue officer! ”
Amongst the correspondence in the excep-
tionally queer conditional perchase case of Mill-
gate v. Hon. John Smith appears the following
too, too suggestive note from Smith ( not the
alphabetical one) to the A.O.M. (alert old man) ol
the C. P. branch of the Lands Department:—“I
have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of the 6th instant, communicating the deci-
sion of the Honorable the Minister for Lands in
the long pending dispute between Mr. G. F. Miti-
gate and myself, and to tender my thanks for the
continuous attention this case has received at
your hands.” The significance of this note lies in
the fact that the decision referred to was a mon-
strous one, disturbing in his holding, as it did, a
bona fide selector four years after he had fulfilled
the conditions required of him.
Apropos of the Franco-Chinese difficulty,
Chinese troops have in the past shown a slow, but
most determined temper. They allowed the
Mahommedan Panthays to occupy a portion of the
South of their empire for years, when, unex-
pectedly, they swarmed upon them and literally
annihilated them. The Kashgar campaign, in the
North, against the Turkish adventurer, Yakoob
Bey, was one of the most remarkable on record.IThe
Ctnnese troops were for years slowly moving
against him. At each fertile spot they would
encamp, and, sowing the fields with grain, actually
“ squat ” there till the crop ripened, and supplied
them with stores. Year after year they pursued
these tactics, until at length they entered Kashgar
in myriads, and overthrew Yakoob Bey and the
independency which he thought he had securely
established.
Under t’ae old feudal system, says the Bris-
bane Australian in a clever article on the Tories
and the British franchise, the landowners held their
lands from the Crown on the condition of military
service or its equivalent in money. In process of
time, while still holding the land, the expenses of
goverment—of which the chief are the cost of war
and police — were taken from the landlords and
placed on the shoulders of the people. The National
Debt has been meuf red for war alone. The charge
on that debt for the year 1882-83 was £39,679,098. The
Army and Navy estimates for the same year were
£31,430,754. Adding these two items, wo find the
total war expenditure for the year was £61,099,853.
The total expenditure of the United Kingdom for
all purposes was £88,906,378. That is to say, govern-
ment expenditure of all kinds, other than naval and
military, for the year 1883-83 was only £37,806,436, or
less than a third of the whole expenditure. So the
people of the United Kingdom pay over Sixty Mil-
lions per annum which, in aecordance with their
original feudal tenure, should be paid by the land-
lords alone.
At the battle of Trinikat, says the San
Francisco Chronicle, “A number of sheiks, who
advanced empty handed, to show that they bore
charmed live?, were stricken down with bayonet
thrusts.” Think of that and weep I Again, “a
splendid display of heroism was made by the
mounted rebels, who resolutely maintained their
? round against the shock of two cavalry charges,
n the third charge they were cut down, but not
before they had killed several men and wounded
Colonel Barrow with their spears.” So these daunt-
less soearsmen are “ rebels ’ against the authority
of Egyptian curs, who—fully equipped and ably
led—fell down and roared for mercy directly they
smelt powder; and by “ cutting them down” the
Grand Old Man is settling the Egyptian Question.
Why not discover that the miserable Egyptians
are rebelling against the Soudanese, and cut them
down ? It would do just as much towards settling
the difficulty, and—properly managed—needn’t
cost a single British life, nor an ounce of British
powder. The Highlanders might go round, and
after taking the rifles from the trembling hands of
Pharoah’s people, quietly proceed to blow off their
“ historic ” heads.
M. Henri Courmeaux says:—“I am in a
position to prove that a great deal of exaggera-
tion and alarmist nonsense has been spoken and
written on this (the recidiviste) subject, especi-
ally in Victoria, the colony least threatened.”
All along the noble band of annexers and would-
be rulers of the Pacific Ocean have been kept in
mind that they were doing nothing more than
twisting ropes of sand. Indeed, it appears that
Australia should make haste to federate and con-
stitute a council for the management of a general
Eolicy, if for no other reason, to save the island
rom being misrepresented in Europe by tne con-
tortions of an unusually windy Premier in an
extremely windy little part of the extensive ter-
ritory. In other circumstances, federation might
be allowed to come at a natural pace; but if it is
to be a matter of frequent occurrence that a man
who happens to find himself Premier of one of the
colonies will have it in his power to cut such antics
in the face of Europe as the Victorian Premier
cuts, and to present all his inane drivel as the
voice of Australia, it is fitting that Australia
should hurry on events, so as to repress such
humiliating idiosyncrasies.
Spanish republicans are making desperate
efforts to get their wretched country free from
the toils of bastard monarchial constitutionalism—
or. as the conservative correspondents of the con-
servative Sydney dailies put it—“ Another anar-
chist plot discovered in Spain : vigorous measures
being taken to stamp out the movement ”;
etcetera and so on, just as though it were anar-
chical to protest against misrule, and to struggle
for liberty. The anarchists of Spain are those in
high place, who pander to the whims of a court
party, the sole aim of which is to live in luxury
at the expense of a down-trodden people.—
Harlots throng the Csesar’s palace,
Bastards drain the realm of gold,
Panders drug the royal chalice,
Rank and place are bought and sold,
and the noble, and the honest, and the true, who
conspire to end the accursed state of things, are
branded by Granny and the Rum—such is the
awful grotesqueness of the irony of fate I—as
“anarchists.” Some issues back we gave Alphonso a
couple of years to run, but now, despite his being
backed by the bully of Berlin, we hardly think his
luck will last so long—the less long the better.
Professor Max Muller, lecturing the other
day at Birmingham, referred to what tie called the
eloquent speeches of Henry George on “ Progress
and Poverty.” “It was of little use,” he said, “to
grow angry about the question of nationalisation
of the land, or to bandy hard names. Let them
Study the question historically. Let them see how
the various kinds of tenure of land arose; let them
distinguish, in fact, between them. He had no
doubt that history would show that there were
tenures of land to which originally heavy condi-
tions, such as military service, were attached, and
that many of those conditions were no longer ful-
filled. Even in more recent times history mignt
show that common land was inclosed in defiance
of historical rights. Those, therefore, who had any
regard for the past and for historical rights—the
great conservative party—ought not to be so angry
with Henry George. What, however, he should
like to protest against was the outcry that
George's theories were ‘dangerous.’ He did not
believe it. They all held theories which might be
called dangerous, but which they never thought
of carrying out—such, for Instance, as loving their
neighbours exactly like themselves. And yet that
theory was not considered very dangerous, even
though it led some of the early Christians to have
‘all things in common.’ ” True for you, Max.
It is now “Horrible London,” “Loath-
some Liverpool,” “Beastly Birmingham,” “Abo-
minable Aberdeen,” “Gruesome Glasgow,” “Me-
phitic Manchester,” and “Effluvial Edinburgh.”
The Public Health Committee of Aberdeen re-
cently reported 30 persons found dwelling in a
single room, and 340 families in 49 small houses.
In the “old town” of “auld Reekie” the squalor
and poverty are said to be absolutely sickening.
At Glasgow, single-room houses are still in exis-
tence. Cooking, sleeping, and everything else
goes on in the same apartment, and overcrowding
is the rule John Bright, in delivering his rectorial
address before the students, startled the commu-
nity by a calculation showing the enormous num-
ber of single-room houses in Glasgow, and £he
average number of occupants. “Glasgow” (says
an English paper) “has looked askance at London,
Liverpool, and Birmingham with a kind of “see
what we have done” expression; but, apart from
many old evils which still exist, her efforts at
reform have created abuses of an almost hideous
nature ” How much wiser it would be for Great
Britain to try to put these matters straight with
some of these millions she squanders on the fads of
imperialism, than to be everlastingly crammirg
what her blind guides call civilization down the
throats of Bechuana«, Zulus, Arabs, and Polyne-
sians, who, in the essential decencies of life, are
infinitely ahead of the poor lost wretches who
continue to rot, not live, in her imperial slums.
Touching the Home Rule question in Ire-
land, Jeremy Bentham used to say, “ Only by
making the ruling few uneasy can the oppressed
many obtain relief.” Byron called England's
union with Ireland, “the union of the shark with
its prey.” Edmund Burke, the Cicero of a century
back, declared, “ Ireland has learnt, at last, that
Justice is to be had from England, only when de-
manded at the sword’s point.” The great Grattan
thundered: “When England asks what right have
the Irish to make laws for themselves? Ireland
will not answer, but demands, what right has
England to make laws for Ireland? From nature
she has none. Nature has not given any one
nation a right over another. Has she that right
from covenant. Let her show the covenant. In
what history is it recorded ? There is no such
thing in legislation.” In 1866 John Bright said to
the people in Dublin: “Years ago, when I have
thought of the condition of irejand—of its sorrows
and wrongs—of the discredit that its condition has
brought upon the English name, 1 have thought
that if I could be in all other things the same, but
by birth au Irishman, there is not a town in this
Island that I would not visit for the purpose of dis-
cussing the great Irish question, and of rousing
my countrymen to some great and united action.
And the Grand Old Man, himself, declared, “ Eng-
land never concedes anything to Ireland except
when moved to do so by fear.” After that lot let
us hear no more twaddle about Home Rule being
a question solely of the present day.
Mr. D. C. Maunsel, late private secretary
for Major Atkinson, Premier of N.Z., is a bos i
hand at keeping accounts. During the recent trip
of the Premier and Sir Frederick Whittaker to
Sydney and Melbourne, D. C. acted as treasurer
and paid all expenses, un his return to Welling-
ton, the Auditor-General wanted to know, you
know, where all the money drawn for had gone,
but the treasurer said he was so ill during the trip
that he lost his reckoning. He did not keep any
bank or cash book, but stored the money loose In
his trousers pocket, and when the Major or Sir
Freddie wanted a bob or two to spend, he jus
forked them out and asked no questions. As thff
explanation did not satisfy Mr. Fitzgerald (the
Auditor-General), he laid an information for em.
bezzlement against the secretary. The “ demniticn
total” of deficiency was at first £410 0s. Id., but
this was gradually reduced by the production of
vouchers, to about half that sum. Voucheis and
receipts for the trip were, in fact, turning up
daily while the case was being Investigated at the
R.M. Court, Wellington, Some of these documents
were discovered in Sir Freddie’s bell-topper, where
they had been placed to make the beaver fit the
knightly cranium, while others were found stuffed
in one of the Major’s boots, where they had
been put to stop a leak during the Melbourne
visit. As the deficiency was daily disappearing by
these and other lucky discoveries, the case
against the accused was dismissed, and he left the
Court and had a drink at the City Buffet without a
Stain on his shirt-front worth noticing.

Just here we are reminded that we saw
Horace Bent last night. Horace was handling the
bones. We know that he prefers soup bones when
+ hev are well-done, but he must have something
tn rattle. By the way, Horace has got so used to
r-attlioB’ those bones, that his tongue has caught
the infection, and he rattles off soir e of the tallest
varus known to the posterity of the ancients. But
we were going to tell you a yarn about Horace.
Mr Bent is always suffering from one malady or
another. At least, he thinks he is. Every time he
takes a drink or two he imagines that he
has got the cold shivers. So he goes to bed
and orders 45 hot whiskys, while the troupe are
anrrving through the night’s performance. When
thev get home, at last, Horace is so bad-so
“ shivery,” as it were—that they cover him up
with their overcoats. One night they put the
whole seventeen overcoats on him, and they have
never seen any of them since. We don’t say that
Horace swallowed them. Not us. We know that
he didn’t, and, any way, he divided the proceeds
with us, and we’re not going back on a pal lust as
winter’s coming on. We might want another
overcoat, don’t you see ?
Alf. Moynham swallowed his foot last
night. He said that he had been bilious for some
time and wanted to tickle up his liver. 8am
Keenan came in, and, taking him for a wheel-
barrow, first fell over him and then wheeled him
off the stage. It is next door to delirium tremens
to see those Girards exercise themselves. Some of
their contortions are so up-side-down like, that
one wants to stand on his head to look at them.

We would say something about Carroll
the double-voiced vocalist, but we have already
made him so proud that he won’t speak
to us in the street. All that he wants is a
few feathers and a red top-knot to make
him the boss peacock of the whole barn-
yard. Now that it occurs to us, we are going to
tell you something that nobody knows but us.
Did you ever notice how funny a man gets when
he “blacks” up? A man may be as sober as a
gallon of vinegar when he is off the stage, but let
him black up with burnt cork, and jokes ooze out
of him like crabs when the tide goes out. You
wouldn’t believe it, perhaps, but we always black
up before we sit down to write. We discovered
that the more we had to do with the cork the
funnier we got. One time we got so very funny
that our landlady hung us out on the clothes-line,
nd the wind blew us inside dut.

Fred. Hiscocks is still smiling away. Like
Sam Genese of the Opera House, he doesn’t care a
fig how many Banks break so that the people
crowd his house. We would give anything
for Hiscocks’ smile. It is so warm and
genial that we are sure it would make a good
overcoat. And this reminds us of the winter
we were in Wisconsin, when the thermometer went
down to 45° below zero, and we were without an
overcoat. But necessity is the mother of inven-
tion. (We’re going to call our mother Necessity).
That’s what made Hannibal fertile in exploit and
expedient in command; that’s what made Napo-
leon scale the Alps, and mingle the eagles of
France with the eagles of the crags; and that’s
what made us get an ulster. You see, Wisconsin
is a great butter-making State. The Germans
mostly make the butter over there, and they are
not so clean about it as they ought to be. So we
bought a few rolls and spread them out, about a
quarter of an inch thick, on a table, and Jet it dry.
In the morning, we had one of the finest blankets
ever seen In the States. It made a good ulster, and
we were happy. But there comes that confounded
“ devil ” yelling for copy, and wo must ante-up, or
We’ll be too late for “ The Squire.”
• • •
You know “ The Squire ” is on at the
Gaiety. We told you last week who “The Squire ”
was. You have forgotten ? Well, we’ll repeat.
It is Maggie Knight who p'ays the Squire. Maggie,
you see, is the last of the race of Yarltys, a good
old English family, who were descended from
Adam. Some people are doubtful about their
ancestry, but Maggie is not. She can go back 4000
years and put her finger on the mau who started
er family in the human race. Most of them have
been-ttat racers, but Maggie is a hurdle-jumper.
This is owing to the many lifts wo have given her
a id the “ rises " wo mean to take outof her as the
years roll on. Maggie gets into a lot of trouble
s the Squire, and she takes you along with
h'-r in such a realistic manner, that you want to
get right up and lift the roof off the meeting
house. But away with Maggie and her misery.
We are bursting to tell you a story about James
Carden, who plays Gilbert Hythe. One time Mr.
Carden lived down in Melbourne, next door to a
man who had a great reverence for birth and
blood. The neighbour got to talking to James
over the Carden wall, as it were, and “Jim,” as
the “ pros.” call him, stuffed him full of lies. The
biggest one he told him was that he was the son of
Sir James Carden, of Ireland. This got into the
papers. It so happened that Sir James had several
sons, one of whom was in Australia at the time,
very hard up. He wrote to the professional
James, calling him “dear brother,” and request-
ing a little aid. The poor fellow really supposed
that his younger brother had come out to Aus-
tralia just like we did, to see the country,
and have fun with the folks. But the actor
didn't answer. In the first place he didn’t know
what to say, and in the next he hadn’t anything at
hand to “part,” except his hair, and he couldn't
spare that It was spare enough already. Years
afterward the genuine Mr. Carden fell heir to an
estate of several thousand pounds. This also got
into the papers, and the actor called on him,
claiming relationship. The real Carden got right
up on the end of his vertebras and denounced
James as a pretender. You don’t see any fun in
this, perhaps, but if you heard Carden tell
about ft you would feel like taking a walk through
a cemetery to cheer you up.

You ought to see Mr. Coleman in the
scene. Whe he comes on, you dis-
cover at once that he has been drinking too much
ginger-beer, or something, and you involuntarily
want to rush up to support him. He is the funniest
man in the whole outfit; and those who know him
are only sorry because he isn’t drunk all the time.
The attendance at the Gaiety is not what It ought
to have been since “The Squire” was pat on the
boards. It is a piece really deserving of liberal
patronage, or we wouldn’t say so. And, after all,
we don’t know that we have said so.

The Majeroni troupe arrived from Bris-
bane on Monday, and have gone on to Melbourne
to play their repertoire over again. We under-
stand that Mr. James Allison has served an injunc-
tion against Signor Majeroni to keep him from
playing “ Fedora ” Mr. Allison claims to have
purchased the right of the play; and, from mem-
bers of the company, we hear that “he’s more
than half right.”
Sir Arthur Gordon has been playing a
heartless little game at Fiji. If all said about him
in Melbourne bo correct, the British Government
should re'egate him to obscurity at once. It
appears Impossible to get him to understand what
is genuine, commercial, and philanthropic enter-
prise; and when, by dint of persistent driving at
him, it is hoped he has focussed the point, he
turns on the commercial philanthropists, and with
official courtesy, dubs them swindlers. In the
good old days before annexation, a lot of Mel-
bourne men put their heads together and induced
King Thackambau to cede a large slice of his terri-
tory to them for—of course, a,valuable considera-
tion. These men called themselves the Polynesia
Company, and on the directory wero such irre-
proachable names as W. B. Jones, L. L. Smith, H.
Hoytt, B. Marks, and G. K. Johnston. Now
when Great Britain annexed Fiji, the newly
, born Government refused to know the e.
bourne Josephs—in. as far, at all events,
as the major part of this ceded territory
was concerned. And Sir Arthur Gordon not
alone spurned their claim, but passed a special
ukase du uig his autocratic reign precluding them
from br nglng their claims before the Supreme
court <>f , jjl And then he gav e valunble olocks
of land in Suva, “th) property of this company,”
over to Government officials. All this was rough
on the part of Sir Arthur, but what was worse
w .a that when the company appealed to the
Colonial Office the replies from that quarter were
most unsatisfactory. What remained to be done;?
Well, Mr. W. B. Jones has been forwarded to
London to lay the matter before Earl Derby in
Serson, and the directors, who held a meeting in
[elbourne lately, are sanguine that when Eirl
Derbv nas listened to Jones for half an hour ho
will discredit and disrate the unjust Sir Arthur
and will r ituy the compact made in the d ys of
darkness between the shrewd southern Smiths
and the child of Nature, Thackamban.

of the Sydney Cup in

was dining at an hotel
jn Toowoomba some
short time ago, when a
gentleman sitting op-

him which horse he
thought would win the
Sydney Cup, and he re-
plied, ‘ Favo,’ which
created a little merri-
ment, and the waitress,
Julia Power, who was

down, sent E B. Jones

The articles for the
Hanlan - Laycock race,
on the Nepean, for £500,
stipulate that the event
is to come off on the
Nepean course, from
near the Gorge to the
Bridge, on the after-
noon of Thursday, May-
22. and the distance will
be 34 miles. The start
is to be by mutual con-
sent ; but if not made
within 15 minutes after
the men are at their
posts, the umpire will
start them by signal.
The race is to start at a
quarter to 3 o’clock ;
and if only one competi-
tor comes to the start,
he will be entitled to the
stakes, no matter from
what cause the other

In the event of the

tion on his part, and tacitly consented to a viola-
tion of the rules, and that he was informed by the
secretary of the Boston A.C. that Mr, Murray's ex-
penses were to be paid and the handicap arranged
for him to win.” Queer amateurs in the States 1
Says Donald Dinnu in a letter to the Mel-
bourne Sportsman:— " Scotchmen do not need to
invent a style to suit themselves, as they have
always been able to beat Englishmen at ‘go-as-
you-please’ wrestling, or fighting, or general
athletics. ‘Deeds approve the man/*’ There was
no occasion for Donald to make a distinction be-
tween a Scotch fight and a go-as-you-please, for,
when a couple of " scuts ” start a fight, it is a go-
as-you-please with a vengeance, composed chiefly
of gouging and throttling, with the occasional loss
of a leg or a nasal organ.
In place of Lord Falmouth, Lord Gros-
venor, and Count Lagrange, the English turf has
no new comers to register. The Dowager Duchess
of Montrose is merely taking over in her own
name, or rather in that of “ Mr. Manton,” which
she has chosen as a transparent pseudonym, the
horses which last year ran in the name of Sir
Frederick Johnstone. Captain Machell has under-
taken the difficult task of “managing” them for
her, and if he succeeds in doing so to his own
satisfaction as well as to hers, he will assuredly be
the hero of the season 1884.
J. White, an Adelaide lad, has challenged
B. Murphy to walk from two to ten miles, for £35
a side, Murphy to receive £5 for expenses if he
goes to Adelaide. W. Hanlon has challenged
young Franks for a two or four mile walk for fifty
ora century aside, to come off in Ballarat. He is
two years older than Franks, and states he is
willing to concede 60 yards in two or 150 in four
miles. The Nooze made a huge goak out of this
challenge, but as the lad in question is named W.
Hanlon, and the sculler is Edward Hanlan, we
don’t exactly see where it comes in.
But for the engineering skill of the mem-
bers of the Wilcannia Boating Club, they would
have been unable to hold their annual regatta this
year, on account of the scarcity of water in the
river. The difficulty was got over by picking a
likely spot and constructing a sand-bag dam, by
which means they succeeded in obtaining a rise of
174 inches, which backed the water up for some
three miles. The racing passed off satisfactorily,
and we think it is only fair to Mr. Waldron to
state there are probably few of our metropolitan
oarsmen who could beat him—in a crab-catching
match.
A Volunteer encampment was held in Wel-
lington (N.Z.) at Easter, and does not appear to
have proved a great success, according to the ideas
of the Wanganui men present. Wanganui has an
annual encampment, followed by a ball—Welling-
ton had no ball. As the steamer containing the
Wanganui men moved from the wharf, those on
board gave “three cheers for the encampment
ball,” “ three cheers for the moat that was crawl-
ing,” “ three cheers for the tea we didn’t have.”
The emotion of the Wellington officers assembled
on the wharf (to quote Mark Twain) would have
brought tears to the eyes of a cast-iron dog.
At Herberton, (Q.), District Ceurt, a Mr.
Towner recovered £16 13s. 4d. from the treasurer
of the Wild River Jockey Club, amount advanced
by him to meet the liabilities of the annual race
meeting of 1882. It appears that at the settling at
the race meeting in question, the Club had a deficit
of funds, to meet which six members gave a pro-
missory note, which the Club promised to take up,
but which was dishonoured, and the signatories
had to ante-up. Towner’s share was £16 13s. 4d.
for which he obtained a verdict. There was no
quorum at the original meeting in 1882, and the
verdict would probably have gone with the pre-
sent committe, if they had not given themselves
away by previously offering to pay Towner 10s. in
the pound.
“Like father like son,” is a truthful pro-
verb when racehorses are in question. Scott Free*
whose victory in the Two Thousand Guineas was
cabled last week, is a son of the great Macgregor,
who pulled eff the same event in 1870, when making
his debut before the public. Macgregor’s was the
hollowest victory ever known, and as he followed
it up by winning the Bath Biennial in a “walk,”
the “ books ” took fright, and the bold Mac. se-
cured an undying notoriety by starting at five to
two on for the Epsom Derby. That he was a
broken-dawn horse, when he started and finished
“nowhere ” to Kingcraft, is a matter of history—
it remains to be seen whether Scott Free (a par-
ticularly well-named horse, being out of Celibacy),
can redeem his progenitor’s defeat. It is worthy of
note that Macgregor, and most of his stock, have
very upright pasterns, a peculiarity that ill adapts
them for coming down the steep hill at Epsom. It
is still more worthy of note that Lord Falmouth’s
horse, Harvester, came in third to Scot Free—the
same position that Kingcraft (also the property of
his lordship) occupied to Macgregor, previous to
turning the tables in the Derby. And, singularly
enough, Lord Falmouth’s other Derby winner,
Silvio, also secured third place in the Guineas.
His horses are never hurried in their preparations,
so there «re more unlikeiy things than Harvester
improving on his recent performance and securing
the Blue Riband of the Turf.
Showery weather

After the Ross-
Bubear race on the
Thames, some interest
was aroused by a
double-sculling match
between D. Godwin
and G. Perkins, who
had accompanied Ross
in his practice, and C.
and T. Gibson, who had
performed a like duty
for Bubear, between
Ham m ersmith Bridge
and the Creek. The
first-named pair, who
conceded 6 sec., were
made favourites, and
the result was never in
doubt, as it was appar-
ent before they had
gone a quarter of a
mile that Boss’s atten-
dants had matters en-
tirely in their own
hands, as they quickly
drew up, and finally
paddled past the post a
length in front. The
winners have since
thrown out a challenge
to double-scull any two
men in the country for
£100 a-side.
He made one of the
late Synney Interco-
lonial Bight, and while
in Melbourne the other
members of the crew
subscribed a bob each
for the purpose of his
taking a lesson in the
“ noble art ” from a
certain Cabbage Garden
“Professor.” Now, the
gentleman we refer to
is about the smartest
amateur set-to it has
been our lot to see per-
form, notwithstanding
a bland and childlike
manner and appear-
ance. The Professor, as
per usual, at once ad-
vised his pupil not to
stand light hand in
front, as he left him-
self so completely open
that a man with any
science could kill him
were he so inclined. The
lesson proceeded quietly
for some time, when the
oarsman madeplay.and,
to the astonishment of
the “Professor,” belted
him most unmercifully
round the room. The
Professor was more
than satisfied, and at
the termination of the
bout said if ho got hold
of many such pupils it
would be about time
to relinquish his “pro-
fession ” or order his
coffin.
Donald Dinnie, the Scottish athlete, was
born at Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on the
10th of July, 1837. He stands 6 ft. 1 inch in his
shoes, weighs when in fair condition 13 st. 13 lb.;
measures round the chest 48 inches ; biceps 16M
inches ; thigh, 26hs inches ; calf, 17J4 inches. Next
week we shall give the circumference of his—big
toe and its other dimensions to a fraction; mean-
time the above particulars will be of great service
to a world hungering and thirsting after similar
information. Donald is a splendid specimen of
mature manhood. He takes the world very easily.
Nobody ever saw Donald in a hurry oi quarrelling.
He is, in fact, a decent, good-natured Scotchman,
with a tremendous lot of latent force stored up
ready for use when wanted. Dinnie first per-
formed at athletic gatherings when he was 16
years old, so that he has been upwards of 30 years
putting the stone and tossing tee caber. He has
won over 6000 money prizes in his time and has as
many champion medals as would plate a man of
war from stem to stern.

At the Sydney Amateur Athletic Club’s
sports on Saturday last, the 100 yards’ Challenge
Cup was run in rather an unsatisfactory manner.
After any number of false starts, the pistol
snapped, and all dashed away, except P. James,
who was left on the post. Baylis came in first, a
yard ahead of Grainger; but as the pistol had only
snapped it was decided to run the event over again.
Baylis and Grainger refused to start, and the second
race resulted in a win for P. James. The races were
run in the stated times of 10 3-10 sec. and 10 6-10 sec.
respectively. Shipway fairly threw the two
miles’ walk Challenge Cup away. Early in the
race he was cautioned, and, towards the finish,
when he certainly had the race in hand, he did a
“show” spurt, and was disqualified when only
fifty yards from home. Had he won the event on
Saturday, the Cup would have become his pro-
perty. Ferris did not run up to last year’s form in
the mile. He made his effort too soon, and
although he passed Middleton at the back of the
course in the last lap, he was unable to hold his
own, and Middleton passed him some fifty yards
from home. The heavy going suited Middleton,
and Ferris made a big mistake in making the run-
ning so soon.
The race on Saturday last between Solo-
mon and Gulliford was another instance that a
race is never over till the Judge’sJflag descends;
and that, no matter how bad a man feels in his
boat, he may rest assured that in nine cases out of
ten his opponent is in much the same strait, and
it is Just a matter of who cracks first—that is, of
course, if the men are anything like equal in pace.
The men showed out in two equal boats built by
Donnelly and Sullivan, and started by mutual
consent. Solomon, being an old hand at the game,
got away with a slight advantage, which he in-
creased to 3 lengths by time Uhr’s Point was shot,
but Gulliford, pulling in much the best style, com-
menced to overhaul his leader, and at the mile had
a length to the good. At Tennyson, he had in-
creased his lead to four lengths and the race was
considered such a certainty for him that a King-
gtreet sporting publican offered to lay £20 to £2 on
him, but without response. A little further on,
Solomon spurted, and with such effect that he
rowed clean past his opponent, who was done to
such a turn that he was unable to make an effort
to keep pride of place. Solomon pulled a game
race, and showed he is possessed of more bottom
than he is generally credited with.

What lucky dogs those Melbourne press-
men are, to be sure. Some of them always dre p-
ping into a good thing. Why, it is only a short year
ago ihat one of them managed to captivate the
handsome widow of a deceased miner, who, on step-
ping out for the Golden Shore, left her bullion and
real estate estimated at many thousands. And
now, instead of doing “the rounds” for David
Syme “on his uppers,” so to speak, he drives
through the c'ty behind a pair of high-stepping
horses, in a carriage fit for a Rajah er something,
in a style calculated to turn his less fortunate
brethren of the quill green with envy. That was
a win for the Age, so the evening paper scribes
determined that the next victory should score to
their account. And it did ; a World inkslinger
was the fortunate man. A couple of weeks ago a
conflagration took place in Sandridge, and this
enterprising youth was sent to collate information
thereof for the Evening Mortimer. With char-
acteristic zeal, and a desire for supplying minute
details, he was poking about the ruins of the pre-
mises, when suddenly he disappeared, as though
the earth had swallowed him. But it hadn’t. He
had unwittingly walked on to some rotten boards
that formed the covering of an old tank, into
which he gracefully, if not rather precipitately
descended, without as much as saying “ By yer
leave.” He had, indeed, literally dropped into a
good thing—was, in fact, “up to his neck in it”—
and had to be hauled out with a twenty-feet
derrick and a hoisting tackle. And then he had to
be hosed down by the firemen, deodorised and
disinfected, and his “ copy ” subjected to the “ hot
air” and sulphur fumigating process before it
could be received in Flinders Lane. Yes, even
though we lay ourselves open to the charge of
reiteration, wo repeat with increased vehemence
that those Melbourne pressmen are lucky dogs.
The new Postmaster-General of Victoria
has had his chance, and has Jumped level with the
expectations formed of him. He pledged himself
to do his best to please everybody, and to swell
the revenues of his department. A crucial case
has turned up. A little township down there got
Itself baptised into civilisation under the start-
lingly original style and title of “L.L. Vale.”
Antiquarian research might show how it came to
adopt such an eccentric designation; and when it
produces a five-legged calf, or a mare that will
fling a three-legged stool, it may be worth while
to go that way and dig into the research. In print
the name is suggestive of several origins. For
instance, Mr. Yale, the temperance orator, may
have been about there in the beginning of things,
and it is nearly certain that there was a little of
Dunvllle’s elixir about there also, and, not un-
naturally, the astute founders of the township
made friends with sin and grace. Or it may be
that the place reclaimed from barbarism was
merely a vale, and that the first reclaimers de-
rived such special advantages from the medical
skill of the illustrious Melbourne L.L. that in the
flush of recovered energies they determined to
advertise him gratis while their town existed. But
leaving the origin of the name to antiquarians, we
go on to show how the Postmaster-General has
scored a difficult trick. Some restless people
shifted from L.L. Vale, and going a few
miles down started another township called
Mitcham. Strangers came and built there, and a
couple of months ago Mltchan was as big as the
•ancient L.L. Vale. Now came the tug of war.
Which of them should have the Post Office ?
Mitcham rolled up its trousers and went down to
interview Mr. Campbell on the matter; and L.L.
rolled up its trousers also, and started on the s«me
mission. They found the Postmaster-General.
They mopped their foreheads and burst into elo-
quence, and to the remonstrance “ One at a time,
gentlemen, one at a time,” they were as deaf as
adders. “I’ll tell you what I will do,” said Mr.
Campbell, when the countrymen were talked out:
“I’ll open a window at L.L. Vale and a window at
Mitcham for receiving letters. D’ye mind me? I’ll
leave these windows open for nine months. D’ye
mind me ? At the end of the nine months. I’ll
count all the letters posted in L.L. and all the
letters posted in Mitcham. D’ye mind me ? And
whichever place posts the most letters, that’s the
place that’ll have the Post Office.” And L.L. Vale
and Mitcham are doing nothing but writing letters
and posting them, and the sale of stamps up there
is greater than throughout half Victoria. Does
not that show that the new Postmaster-General
can Jump level with expectations ?
We always have had an opinion that the
Gladstonlan policy of “ peace at any price ” was at
best but a poor attempt at preserving the dignity
of the mighty Empire to which it is our proud
privilege to belong. And now that we find our
hands are being strengthened, as it were, by the
cognate views of the cultured editors who run the
country press, our cup of happiness is fairly
brimming over. In our humble and unassuming
way, we have repeatedly warned Mr. Gladstone
that his style of doing business did not meet with
our approval, and that it was calculated not only
to tarnish the otherwise bright escutcheon of
Britain’s fame, but that it would eventually slop
right over the whole shield. But, so far, our ad-
vice has been unheeded, and our warnings have
been void of effect, for we notice that Glad-
stone Just ploughs along in his own furrow
(this striking simile for the farmers’ mind),
so to speak. The Grand Old Man will be
sorry for it some day. We are sometimes
sorry ourselves—when we get sober. All great
men are. [Tut-tut 1— Ed. B.l However, we have
discovered the reason why the G.O.M. “cooked a
deaf ’un” to our counsel. Our style was not
fetching enough for the English premier. Our
feeble efforts would not or could not, or some-
thing, rise to the exigencies of the situation, and
hence our waste of time and talent. But the
erudite leader-writer of the Nathalia Herald
(Vic.) has come to the rescue with his willing and
able pen, and, in language as clearly expressed, as
the sentiments are ennobling and lofty, deals
1 sledge-hammer blows at the vaccillatmg and
weak-kneed policy of the elderly gentleman who
guide* the destinies of the British Empire. He
points out with characteristic lucidity and start-
ling accuracy that 30,000 lives have been sacrificed
in the Soudan, that the results of the campaign
have so far heen worse than useless, and that the
chances of General Gordon ever getting out of
his present difficulties with a whole skin are very
slim indeed. We feel, however, that in condensing
his leader, we are doing him an injustice;
and at the risk of over crowding our valuable
space wo have selected a chunk from the article
under notice, which we give pro bono publico.
Hear the gifted scribe “ Should such unfortu-
nately be the case, we expect the usual retribution
will take place, and a few more thousand Arabs
butchered, and all, as Mr. Gladstone says, that
peace may be. We are pleased to see that dissen-
sions (sic) are arising in the Cabinet, and Mr. Glad-
stone’s senseless policy is being strongly Arabs,
which will take centuries to appease. The defeat
of Toleba will be chronicled in their annals and its
dlstirred up hatred in the breast of asters told
from father to son, and opposed. By every right-
thinking taxpayer throughout England we think
it is abhorred, and Justly so.” (sic) So do we. And
somehow, we hardly know what to think. That
last drop of rum was rather strong. Yet, we fancy
that the Nathalia editor had been “where tha
stream was gently flowing” before penning that
brilliant leader. Or perhaps he was down the
cellar for a spell. However, we hear the voice of
the Missus calling for some chopped wood, and we
must give up speculating.

SOCIAL
The third of the Socials at Tattersall’s Hall,
on Friday last, was considered the best yet, as
there was a convenient number present, and the
company are fast getting to know and esteem one
another. At the same time, a small sprinkling of
visitors to whom tickets were issued helped to
freshen the assembly, and to gratify that desire
for new faces and love of change always so strong
in the bosom of the sex which is said to be fickle
as well as fair. The trio of musicians sat and
thrummed their instruments as the hall slowly
filled, but about 8 o’clock there was quite an acces-
sion of beauty and chivalry all at once, and the
programme once started, was reeled merrily off,
with a brief interval for refreshing. Messrs. Holt,
Pearce, and Marsden assisted on the floor, which was
in good order; and—as the ladies are not expected
to be en grande tenue at a “ small and early if any
toilets caught the eye it was mostly by their neat-
ness. For Instance, if a young lady who happens
to be charmingly pretty decks a dress that is only
plain black, but indicative of personal symmetry,
with coral - red flowers—what more is wanted ?
If a petite dancer is aerial in pure white lawn,
■"’ith a little golden ribbon here and there, and a
flish of gold in her fair brown hair-it would be
unreasonable to desire any further ornament.
Anyone who would load fair simplicity at sweet
seventeen with an elaborate toilet would be
philistine enough to paint a lily, or scent a violet,
with the precious idea of improving it. A slender,
tender maiden reminded us of one in Ingoldsby s
poems, for “ the Lady Jane was tali and slim, and
the Lady Jane was fair,” and so was this lady, and
very graceful in her flowing black skirts, and
her fair hair done exactly the way it is
on a shilling we have in our pocket, and
which we shall try and keep in memory
of her. A darker damosel suited her style
in dark green satin, broad-pleated, and was
noticed because of her Recamier’d hair. This is
the French way of saying it was cut short and
curled, like unto the hair of the Ethiop. And we
would here observe that all the girls who have cut
their hair short are now in the fashion and most
of them have colds in consequence. A lady of
Majeronl kind of face and figure, from Surry
Hills, in black brochd tunic and cream skirt, ap-
peared happy, and the cause of her happiness was
never far off. An Ashfleld lady also wpre an
aspect of enjoyment, as well as a rich combination
of cardinal and black in satins. A stately brunette
from the Shore, in blue and ruby, was a beautiful
dancer; so was * tall lady from Stanmore in cream
madras. A tall valseuse and her roseate sister
both came in suitable white from Bodtern. The
prettiestjdress, and in quietest taste, was a dainty,
deep-cream corded silk, worn by a dark young lady
from Moore Park ; and a white veiling, trimmed
with the now unusual peacock greens was nice.
Midnight saw the end of the Social.
The Queen’s first Drawing Room was fixed
for 13th March, but on its being discovered that
this was the anniversary of the day of the “re-
moval ” of Czar Alexander II., the ceremony was
postponed a day. Then the High Church party
were offended because it was held in Lent. Bou-
quets were of enormous size. The Princess of
Wales, who received guests, wore rich gold Indian
embroidery, over a fupe of brown marabout and
draperies of Vandyke velvet; corset of velvet and
sleeves of marabout; train lined with gold satin
and bordered with marabout. Lady George
Nevlll, sister-in-law of Lord William, whom Sir
Salmon consigned to Melbourne recently, was pre-
sented by the Marchioness of Abergavenny.

A Bachelor’s Ball was held at Argoon,
Blverina, on Thursday, 25th ult., which, though
the weather was threatening, was numerously
attended. A picnic, which was to initiate the pro-
ceedings, was stopped by the rain. About 120
responded to the ball invitations. Ladles-princi-
pally single ones, the bachelors’ joy—wore in groat
force, and the honours of belle wers divided by a
fairy in black velvet, from Qlppsland, and one
from Argoon, dressed tastefully in black. Dancing
kept up all night, only interrupted by an excel-
lent supper and several songs by volunteers. A
local poet, Mr. Tranter, reaped great triumphs
with his song “The Bachelors’ Ball,” introducing
local affairs. Mr. James Blain as M.C. and the
musicians kept the floor full, and speeches were
very limited. The pleasant party broke up with
the dawn.

Girls often think men are brutes because
they don’t evince more disposition to marry; but,
after all, it is mostly the girls’ own faults. In the
first place, it is not every girl who is in a position
to support a husband comfortably without his
working. Girls are not careful enough to keep
sweet with their rich old grandpas and affluent
uncles. Now, instead of spending her money in
ribbons, and wire constructions and things, let the
good girl pop her savings into the bank, and don’t
forget to tell it; take her dear old grandpa out to
the sports, and walk him up and down: let every-
one know she visits her darling nunky at least
once a week, and makes him wool slippers every
winter. Another thing; girls don’t help matters
along enough. Many a fine young fellow has gone
down the narrow passage from the parlour, and
“ put the hall lamp out, Charlie,” and out through
the front gate into the silent night—a bachelor;
not because his lady-love won’t have him, but be-
cause she never adopted the peculiarly simple
plan of asking him. It’s a wonder that girls over-
look these very simple things.

It was at a recent bazaar—never mind
where. He had been pestered to buy things he
didn't want, and a relentless girl came up for the
tenth time with a doll that had goggly eyes and a
bustle (the doll had), and again she offered him a
share in the horrible thing (the doll, that is).
“ Really cleaned out,” he protested, “ and you’ve

shudder) “ besides, I might get it!" She let him be

A very fair attendance was seen at the
Sydney Amateur Athletic Club sports, last Satur-
day and there was the music of the German Band
and a good variety of events to please visitors.
The variable weather must have influenced the
show of fashion, which was less observable than
it has often been before, and, as promenading was
onlv practised by a few, there is little to be said of
the toilettes. The fair weare rs of the modern mar-
vellous works of art come out, like butterflies, at
their best only in the sun. Need we say, then, how
everyone regretted that there was not more sun ?
Time was, only a few years ago, when the Sydney
Amateur rates were the great half-yearly events
of the kind; but though they may be no less
interesting than of yore, the public patronage is
now clamoured for and divided by nearly a dozen
clubs of a kindred character. For two months to
come, there will be shows of muscular merit each
Saturday on the Association Ground,

Dearest Belle,— Just fancy the Queen wearing
deep mourning robes at her granddaughter's
wedding ! And how pleasant for the young bride
if she happen to be superstitiously inclined I I
remember once going to a wedding on a very cold
day, and during the ceremony one of the brides-
maids, >ho was suffering from a severe cold,
began to cough, when a well meaning friend who
stood close by her, threw over her shoulders a
hlack fur tippet. This so horrified the mother of
the bride that she actually screamed out, when
it suddenly dawned on the officious friend what
she had done. However, a fleecy white cloud was
soon substituted for the offending black tippet,
but even to this day the old lady talks about the
turn it gave her, and is still looking for the ill luck
which she declares must follow. Butflt has never
come, and I hope it won’t, for they are among tre
happiest couples I know. Some people glory in
these superstitious fancies. I have know girls
walk on the very edge of a kerbing rather than
pass under a ladder, and yet they will alight from
the wrong side of a tram-car without the slightest
hesitation-whlch proves, dear, that they respect
their superstition more than they do their lives.
But, at all events, it is to be hoped that a double
dose of rice and old shoes was showered after the
royal pair in order to help to avert any evil the
Queen’s black robes might have brought them.
Now, if I wore a man, I should be head over ears
in love with the Squire, It is the sweetest, pretti-
est, most fascinating Squire I ever saw. That
sounds funny, you will say; but when I tell you
the Squire is no other than Maggie Knight, it’s all
right, isn’t it? It is so nice having something
good to go and see at the Gaiety—bright, pretty
theatre that it is—and, judging by the attemdance
the other night, others are of the same way of
thinking. Some of the dresses were quite as bril-
liant as one usually sees at the Royal or at the
Opera House. Why it should be an exception to
see ladles in real full dress at the Gaiety, I am at a
loss to understand; but so it is. A lady from one
of the suburbs wore a dress which was rich and
uncommon. It was a black satin profusely
trimmed with line crewel work of divers colours.
The neck was cut V shape, and fastened with an
enormous bunch of pink rose-buds. A pink veil-
ing jupe, pleated on to a black velvet sleeveless
body, was very quaint. The wearer wore her hair
in a peculiar style, which I didn’t quite under-
stand ; seemingly, it was cut close to the head, but,
for all that, a thick coll was worn on the crow a,
but how it came there was a mystery. I liked
Immensely a white satin petticoat, over which
hung, gracefully draped, a ruby velvet polonaise.
Flowers in the hair for evening wear are now
almost unknown —nothing but jewelled pins,
buckles, or chenille ornaments are to be seen.
I went to little May’s birthday party the other
day, for I love to see the little ones enjoying them-
selves, and do you know, dear, I never noticed
before what a hard, unchildish look the present
fashion of cutting the hair quite close to the head
give to the little faces. It is quite a mistake to
imagine that by keeping the hair cut close while
young, it grows in more profusion in after years;
Indeed, science has discovered that it is quite the
reverse. Certainly, it is a very recent discovery,
and will take, perhaps, half a century to make
people believe it, but I always suspected that such
was the case. Look at the Germans, for instance.
Their children have almost invariably beautiful
hair, the wealth of which does not seem to deteri-
orate in the least as they grow older. At any rate,
it has been proved that the constant cutting even-
tually Impoverishes tho roots of the hair, which
then becomes scanty and of crabbed growth.
And, besides. I don’t believe that nature ever
meant that little boys and girls should have their
heads disfigured by this hideous prison crop, and
why it is so popular I cannot make out.
Saturday was a dismal enough day for the
Sydney Amateur Athletic Club sports, but for all
that they were weU patronised. There were slight
showers of rain at Intervals, which accounted for
the Stand being so crowded. A few ladies, who
could not endure having their gorgeous costumes
hidden, ventured out to promenade between
the showers, and were sorry enough before the
day was out, I’ll warrant, as some ol the beautiful
Mary Anderson skirts, which were made just to
tip the ground (a mistake, 1 think), did not benefit
at all by their damp airing. Not any that I saw,
besides ourselves, wore the colours of their
favourite sportsmen, and we, not wishing to be
singular, were cowardly enough to tear our
badges off. We were not sorry afterwards that we
had done so, as our favourite was very much out
of form. I think he can’t have been strict enough
in his training diet of hard biscuits and dry toast.
Most of the dresses were velvets, sometimes com-
bined with satin, and not a few were of the Mary
Anderson style, which is as graceful as it is simple.
By the way, though, these long fine kilts cannot be
made properly without a certain machine which
is very expensive, so most of our warehouses have
imported the skirts ready kilted. I saw one of
brown cashmere at the sports worn by a petite fair
lady, with a straw bonnet of same hue, the only
other colour being a dash of the new light yellow
in the bonnet. Miss Ackman wore a garnet velvet
skirt, perfectly plain, and a short pointed jacket;
and a large bunch of camellias fastened
upon her right hip attracted much notice.
Mrs. Carrugatti looked well in a ruby violet and
satin dress and white princess bonnet with trim-
ming to blend with the dress. In her company,
and attired in what was thought by many to be
the dress on the lawn, was Miss Pooley. Her
choice was myrtle green velvet and satin, with
velvet hat and plumes to match. Miss Barton, in
cream and crushed strawberry, looked fresh and
rosy. Miss Macdonald’s hat, laden with green
grapes, attracted attention, and I daresay many
thought them sour, but the face underneath the
hat looked quite the reverse. An electric blue
satin was one of the brig htest dresses; but one
most suited to the day was a navy serge, trimmed
with numerous rows of narrow gold braid, navy
felt hat adorned with one gold wing. A gray cos-
tume, with velvet jockey cap and scarlet wing, was
worn by a Kandwick lady. 1 liked very much a
dress made wholly of seal brown velvet. I think
ir. is a mistake to trim velvet in any way; it can
hardly be more effective than it is in its own hand-
some simplicity. A black drees, with Spanish
lace pelerine, was made to look uncommon by
reason of the latter being fastened over the left
shoulder by a large blue enamel butterfly with
filigree gold wings.
We have had some fairly good music during the
week, notably the Sacred Harmonic Society’s
Concert, and another Matinee. At the former.
Mr. William Stanley’s cantata “ David and the
Philistines” was performed, and although I was
not there to hear it, I gather that it was very
(For continuation of Social, see next page.)
Any young lady with but slight millinery
experience can make a pleated velvet Beret.
They are most becoming and coquettish little
bats. The stiff shape is trimmed with grey
prunelle and the crown covered with grey
velvet put on full, and slung in two ends at
the side, from which start two stiff grey
feathers.

“Vaid, Wife, and Mother,” lately published in
Sydney, contains quite a number of sensible sug-
gestions and directions for the guidance of women
under various circumstances. These directions
are conveyet in a plain, chatty style, free from
the technicalities which render professional works
on the subject of little value to non-professional
readers.
From Once a Week, Jan. £6.
We have received from the publisher a work
entitled “Maid, Wife, and Mother,” a book for
womankind, containing much necessary 1 iforma-
tlon for the guidance of the sex In pregnancy, &c.
The book, which is issued at a price within the
reach of all, is well and plainly written—many of
the technical expressions and words in use by the
medical profession being replaced by those more
readily understood by the general reader. It is
singularly free from the “ humbug ” and “ twad-
dle ” with which most unscientific works of the
kind abound, and seems, as far as we can judge,
to have been compiled by a writer competent to
deal with the subject. It will n® doubt command
a ready sale.
From the Town and Country Journal, Feb. 9.
“Maid, Wife, and Mother,” is a compilation of
medical data concerning the gentle sex.
From Mrs. Doudney, Diplommd Midwife.
I have looked carefully over the book “ Maid,
Wife, and Mother,” and have no hesitation in
saying that it is an excellent guide for womankind
in the various stages of life.— Rebecca J.

favourably received. The last matinee was cer-
t linly the best Madame Marius and Miss Thompson
have given us ; the names of Hallewell, Francik
and Tom=> bring quite enough to account for that.
Mr. Halleweli’s song from “ Populaire” was the
vocal gem; indeed, he succeeded in rousing the
usually apathetic audience to something like
enthusiasm. He seems to have made a sort of pet
child of this song, and enjoys singing it as
thoroughly as we do listening to it. MissThompson
and Mr. Toms played a duet for two pianos, and
besides that they each performed a solo. Herr
Francik is still improving In his violin playing,
and his solo on Wednesday was really very nice
A young lady who is, I think, a stranger in Sydney,
sang a song, but her enunciation was too imper-
fect for us to catch the words. Her voice was
powerful and fresh, but her style needs improving.
The Kennedy’s are again giving concerts at the
Protestant Hall, but I will tell you about them
next week. They are, I believe, drawing immense
houses, so the Scottish element must be pretty
Strong in Sydney. I wanted to tell you a heap
about “An Arabian Night,” and Mrs. Polk’s beau-
tiful costumes, but that must also wait until next
time. I am glad you received the music safely,

DENOMINATIONAL DROPS
Primate Barry opened St. Stephen’s
Church, N. Willoughby, and seized the opportunity
to orate about his “ call.”
The Hamilton (Yic.) Racing Club shocked
the “ clargy” by holding their meet in “Holy
week. ’ The Rev. Zillman denounced the club
from the pulpit.
Granny speaks of Primate Harry adopt-
ing the astern position during the recital of the
Creed, a circumstance painting to the commission
by his lordship of what the evangelicals regard as
a fundamental error.
“Where is the Christian newness of life?
where is the Kingdom ? what is righteousness and
peace?” Thus asked Bishop Barry in a late
sermon, and about a thousand people voke up and
said Dunno—wha’s about the time ? ”
Unitarian Church (Sydney) finances look-
ing up: revenue equal to expenditure. Tha new
mimstir has evidently entered on a vigorous
Cammpaigr, against the listlessness and apathy
which prevailed so long in the local Unitarian
congregation.
Professor Stade, of the Giessen University,
in a recent lecture speaking of religion in Germany,
said: “Our German Church is at this moment
powerless in strength and influence: she is in the
stadium of decadence of a crisis.” Pretty warm
this from the land of Luther !
Quoth Primate Barry the other day,
with reference to that vexata qxumtio reli-
gious instruction in public schools:—“ If I
am not mistaken there is now growing in
the public opinion of Sydney a certain uneasiness
as to the prospects of the rising generation and the
Colony, unless religious instruction can be made
a substantial and a living reality.” He is mistaken
as regards public opinion, though no doubt there
is a narrow section of the community who are
waxing daily more and more uneasy at the gradual
growth of Secularism. As for public opinion,
viewed broadly and comprehensively it is one ot
contempt for the insolent demands of the Anglican
laziness that, like England, expects every man to
do its duty.
In ’80 the Anglican churchwardens of
the Young congregation, notified Parson Ware
that they could not guarantee his stipend after
March ’81. Ware wouldn’t budge, but held on,
annexing the weekly offertory com as 'sist money.
Neither will he budge, till his flock ante up £850
old, the sum tottle of his little bill against them.
One would have thought that under episcopal rule
such strained relations between pastor and flock
couldn’t be possible, for what Is the use of
authority if not to maintain discipline and prevent
scandal ? It is difficult to imagine a right down
earnest evangelist like old Paul of Tarsus scoop-
ing the plate money of the Ephesians, and telling
them that he wouldn’t vamose the ranche until
they had planked down his arrears of pay, but
then they didn’t know everything down in Judee
and the parts adjacent.
Bishop Moorhouse’s letter to Mr. Craw-
ford on that rain-fetching business is stirring the
orthodox mind The Bishop guarded himself very
fairly, as he did not want to give the enemy occa-
sion for laughter. But, all the same, a slip-rail was
left down. And just inside stood the Bishop’s con-
viction of the inexorably unchanging laws of
physical nature. Here is the argumentum ad
hominem hurled in by a Southern cleric; “If the
laws of physical nature be inexorably unchanging,
why does the Bishop repeat the Lord’s Prayer ? ”
In that prayer occurs the petition “Give us this
day our daily bread.” The question is pertinent,
and should drive the Bishop, if he does not fall
back upon rendering the petition in a spiritual
sense, either to go a little farther, or to turn a
little way back.
John Firth died the other day in the Cook-
town Hospital. The undertaker duly notified the
the Anglican parson, A. C. Mosley, what time the
funeral proeesh would set out—and the parson
didn’t attend. He says the undertaker didn’t defi-
nitely inform him that the deceased Firth was an
Anglican. But what else, reverend sir, could the
fact of the funeral notification, having been ad-
dressed to you, have meant ? That it was a pauper
funeral, and that it was a very wet day, are col-
lateral circumstances which certainly don’t go to-
wards inducing a fellow to give your lame excuse
a help over the stile. Moreover, John Firth had
been some days in the hospital before he died—
whence the inference that the visitation of the
sick poor is a function not very enthusiastically
discharged by you, although it be one much dwelt
upon in “ The Ordering of Priests,” according to
the Anglican rule.
Some days ago, in the Anglican Church of
St. John, Taraworth, Parson Piddington “ im-
prove! ” Albany’s death. Amongst other tedious
va-pid-ities, the holy man declared that Leopold’s
decease was a Providential Mystery, whatever h e
meant by that palpably contradictory phrase. (We
forgot, however; Mr. Piddington naturally em-
ployed both terms in the theologlc sense, and, of
course, that makes a lot of difference, since your
theologian will dish you up a pldt of what he calls
“ sense ” constructed out or that which to the ordin-
ary rationalist is but sheer non-sense.) The funny
thing is, thomrh, that Mother Church can only
espy providential mysteries in matters affecting
Herself and very big people indeed. Were Dean
Cowper to suddenly leave us for Kingdom come, it
would be a providential mystery ; whereas if
widow Jones were to do ditto, devil a ha’porth of
providential mystery would ever a parson, on the
svnodical roll discover in the circumstance.
Having performed the “mystery” trick, Parson
Piddiogi m askedbiscongregation *’
“Was Prince Leopold's work flLished?” .And
then, weakly owning his inability to supply „u
answer, he declared-somewhat too late—that all
one could do v as to bow one’s head to the Great
God, and say “We will not open our mouth”—a
resolution which (so far as orating from a pulpit is
concerned) Piddington should certainly have made
long ago.

The Bishop of Tasmaniasays, with striking
originaljty: “The complex and mysterious char-
acter ot human life Is in no respect more plainly
seen than in the allotment and proportion of joy
and sorrow which falls to each individual.’’ The

cated man conceiving that such a gratuitous bit of
pathos would pass muster for an idea worth pre-
senting to a lot of men and women. If It had

Williams, of the Intercolonial Trades
unions’ Congress, has been deputed to go to Eng-
land and France to make known to the working
classes in those countries,'especially in the latter,
how Australia feels upon the question of the
recidivistes. The idea is a bold one, and not a few
down South claim the credit of having suggested
11 < Among those posing as
the fathersoi|the notion, Woods seems to have the
strongest claim and Gaunson the loudest. Maybe
w iiiiamB will do some good in someway. If le
doesn t do any in the way chalked out, only thos”
who claim to have originated the notion win e
surprised. But the mission may not be anutte-
nullity if it tend to make the working classes of
Australia known to those on the Continent, as
knowledge Is sure to beget identity of aim that
the power of Labour will ever be able to exercise
ip 8 proper influence on the world. It were well,
however, if Mr. Williams carried with him a better
title to be the representative of Australia than the
manner of his election conferred upon him. Un-
fortunately he may be called the Representative
by nuke. There were seven nominations, and the
Congress understood that the competing claims
would be determined by vote Just before the
ballot was taken, however, six of these refused
to act if elected. Consequently Mr. Williams bad
a walk oyer. Now it is declared by a large number
of members that, had those gentlemen who de-
clined to go to the ballot, only declined 10 assent
to nomination, others would have assented to both.
£Sn- blame ’ however, does not rest with Mr.
Williams.
When it suits Tories to represent the senli-
m v “common people” as according with
what they would like people to believe, they never
scruple to declare that contentment with exist-
ing institutions is almost universal. But some-
times their real knowledge or impressions slips out
in unguarded moments. Thus, discussing the
prospects should Mr. Gladstone’s Bill to extend the
franchise i ecome law, the Court Journal, the
I tuft-hunter among newspapers, and the one which
f rnnsf frankly gives voice to the tone of Upper
Ten-dom, naively remarks that: “ The grave defect’
pf the Bill, which we have anxiously pointed out,
is the introduction of a majority of socialism and
republicanism. Let the constituencies have time
to ponder over that; let them think what a demo-
cracy will accomplish.|The agitators are already at
work in expectation, and one of them proudly,
boldly, announces that, having addressed public
meetings all over the country (of men who will
shortly have votes), he finds them, to use his own
simple language, ‘ ripe for plunder.’ ” This is a
distinct confession that the Court Journal
knows, or believe?, that the mass of the British
people, at present denied the right to vote, hold
socialistic and republican sentiments. The con-
cluding reference is a courtly sort of lie. The
reference is to Henry George, who at Glasgow
said he had addressed vast audiences in all parts of
the kingdom, and found them everywhere sensible
of the importance of resumption of the land, and
ripe for ‘ plunder,’ as the landlord party term It
not employing the term on his own account, but
contemptuously quoting it.
The Princess Dolgorouky-.Jourrefsky, the
morganatic widow of the late Czar, accompanied
by her children and suite, lately arrived in Paris at
her residence, the Villa Balzac, in the Champs
“ Morganatic widow ” is Court Journal
for promoted strumpet. The: late Czar took the
Dolgorouky out of a school for the daughters of
the nobility, which served him as a sort of coop
for raising a succeslon of nice young mistresses.
He had taken her elder sister from the coop some
years before, but got tired of her. Dolgorouky
the Second was really attached to her Imperial
keeper, and he had not tired of her when he was
killed, so he left her handsomely provided for.
About half a million sterling is said to have been
her price. Now, the Czar never produced a pound
in his whole life. He simply took what he wanted
from those who did produce it. A Russian
peasant produces by tillage or other in-
dustry about £20 a year on an average.
Of this product of the sweat of his brow,
he is permitted to use about £12 per
annum for his own subsistence, and the
sustenance of his wife and children, if he be un
lucky enough to have any. The other £8 is
impounded by taxation. Of that £8 about £4 is
absorbed in expenses of collection, salaries of
assessors, tax-gatherers, Treasury clerks, and
great officers of the Department. About £2 more
is embezzled by these gentry, and the remaining
£2 reaches the coffers of the state. Thus, to pro-
vide for his wench, the Czar appropriated the whole
year’s earnings, beyond what sufficed for the most
wretched subsistence, of 120,000 of the industrious
among his subjects ; and, in order that he might
have the half million sterling for that moral pur-
pose, the 130,000 poor wretches bad to surrender
no less than £900,000. Or,|to put it another way,
the 120,000 men had to work four months in one
year, and give up the entire results of their labour
for that period, in order that this one among the
Czar’s numerous mistresses might bo provided
for. Don’t duck him in the horsepond!

“but what are you going to do?” "1 want to

how large a flight of locusts would be required to

We can’t help thinking that the two sub-
joined pars, clipped trom the Gundagal Bailey,
are extremely suggestive of the exact converse ot
that which their concocter meant to convey
“We understand that Mr. Wants candidature
will cost a large amount of money. Mr. Watson 8
expenses were a mere bagatelle. — One ot the
most prominent supporters of Mr. Want, directly
the result of the poll was known, was heard to
exclaim-‘If I had known we had any chance of
being licked I would have raised a few dead
’uns.’ ” If these pars, weren t designed to en-
deavour to throw people off the strong scent of
Dinga-Dinga tactics, James Watson deserves to
be called the honorable member for Gundagai.
Sava the “Vagabond” to the Wentworth
Advocate:— “I was once plaintiff in a case m
Sydney. There was an unfortunate adjournment
for lunch, and the £500 damages which would have
gone to the hospital was reduced to a farthing.
&y junior counsel. Mr. J.H .Want, informed mo
that a juryman was ‘squared at mnch-tlme, and
Jem Punch afterwards told me the exact amount
paid. The Judge allowed me costs, but I paid £100
besides to my lawyers, and swore under any cir-
cumstances never again to appeal to a New South
Wales jury.” If all that ‘ coffer Jyne as
that part of it re the proposed disposition of the
£500 damages, it may be safely set down as a
blooming statement of fact. The introduction
into the yarn of the name of the defunct Jem
Punch is exceedingly artful.
We spend nearly £1,000,000 on education,
and here are some of the results :—Martha Harper,
aged 16, the prosecutrix in an alleged rape case at
Cooma, the other day, told the judge that she
couldn t read nor write, couldn t tell tho time of
day, and didn’t know the months of' th ®
when the new year commenced. Like the savages,
she counted time by moons and seasons, and inter
general condition was not a shade above them.
But a witness in the case, a young married shep-
herd named Robert Evans, quite took the cake from
Martha in the matter of solid ignorance. Robert,
in tact, was bogged up to his eyes in the mud of
stupidity. He didn’t know what month of the
year it was, in short, to use his own words, be had
no business whatsomever to do with the month
of the year at all.” And. as for Christmas Eve. he
“ reckoned that was somewhere about, the of
September.” No wonder Holy Joe raised his
Jnncsoent gaze from the “ binch to the ceiling
In pious horror at this revelation, while barrister
Pilcher hurled anathemas at those who failed to
ha ve that million “ properly and evedistnbiuted
throughout the more remote districts of the
country.”
The white spirit up Llstnore way must be
awfully strong and more than ordinarily obnoxious
to literary lucidity when one finds this kind
of swill in the leading columns of the local
chronicle:—“The Star speaks of the ignorance of
the S.M. Herald. To whomsoever the term
ignorance may be applied we are Alined to urge
that charges on the score against such parties sho w
not the ignorance (sic) of the Herald, and the
Colonial Treasurer hue (sic) the wrong impressed
isic) of the paper making such charge The fact
is tho Herald, being an ultra-free trade paper
sees in tho present state of the sugar regulations a
Nation of those principles and therefore advo-
cates a change. although it war (ate) fortunate in
chosing (s icy wheat as a possible stop to be pro-
duced In the event of sugar failing. still it served
to illustrate its principles. The Herald like any
sincere advocate for change of any theory, has a
tendency to become fanatical and endeavour to
bring every industry down to one hard and fast
llne/but we surely give evidnece (sic) °n}y of our
incapiclty (sic) if we desert the ordinary lines of
argument and descend into scurrility having mis-
taken it for proof. Our line the (ate) argument
should bo that our sugar industry is peculiarly

James Service waxed grandly wrath and
threshed the air when talking to ton working men,
in their mimic parliament, about the horrible,
utterly abandoned recidivlstes. These are James s
bogies, much for the same reason as the wind in
the chimney is the bogy of the nursery. How
shall we deal with this evil,” cried the distraught
Premier, “this evil which we may call a visitation
of the devil, an infiltration into our midst of the
siftings of a people who we know are not very
Particular in their morality?” This was Caledonia,

may be called a social vengeance I A people who

Ing fact is that out of this number 34 single

Onlv for his name, it would be thought that Mr.
MTvor was a Frenchman and that he was throw-
ing at tho Roderick Random of Victoria a junk

who we know are not very particular in their
morality are a cut above tolerating such an essen-
tial of immorality as this. Only for his name
and only also that he said nothing about another
little frolic which shows that James s old national
hearthstone can give points to creation in the
matter of illicit additions to population.
The Salvation Army had high jinks at the
Temncranco Hall, Melbourne, lately. Several
startflng “experiences” were disclosed, as (we
auote from the Melbourne D.T.) “illustrating the
saving power s till streaming from Heaven in con-
tinuous flow.” This somehow, seems to convey
the insinuation that the Harmy’s saving-power
“supply ” is liable to be cut off at any minute—
which is feasible enough when you come to think
over it. However, at present it s turned on infull
force for we find (still quoting from the D.T.) an
infidel °who had for forty-six years tried every-
thing but Jesus, and could find no rest or consola-
tinnKon.mp to Him at last, and was now a happy,
SnSa.'' Now, as “coming to Him” means
—according to this—coming to a Salvation Army
meeting it’s only fair to consider that the Army
hasn’t been started for so very many years, thcre-
iv,r*o this nartlcular infidel must, tor the major
portion of P hik life have been “trying” different
filings without the slightest chance of being
“ rescued,” and is deserving of our best sympathy.
But tho most beautiful incident of this Easter
meeting has yet to be mentioned: A pair that

altar, and seemed {dad." f e^ m ?^ 1 f.! a^ 1 ’ a after
should think they were glad—jolly glad, for, after
throwing plates and things at one another for
years a truce must have been acceptable to both
sides ’ By the bye, what quarrelsome couples these

History repeats itself in a style which says
but little for its originality. For example. Old
man Herodotus tells the following truthful tale.
At this time Minus ruled in Assyria, hut Semira-
mide, his queen, practically bossed the Empire.
Attached to the Court was one Umbertlus, who
was a Nubian nigger, and a condemned cheeky
cuss to boot. So much so, that Ninyas, the elder
born, and divers others of the royal household
used to say “Damlm,” as much as seventy-seven
times seven and the one-seventh part of seven
times a day, in consequence thereof. Likewise,
also, did they amuse the Court by smearing hot
sealing-wax and glue along the dining-room chair
of Umbertlus. for he went bare-legged always
(as was the custom of his country), and the style or
his subsequent bucking did amuse the Court most
“ goldemnibly.” Which is a Chaldean word signi-
fying, “Oh, come, let us all be Joyful. But
Minus, happening to go to a special lodge
shivoo, did partake too freely of the Ethiopian
fluid which is known as “ snaikjuico, and after-
wards died in fourteen acts, to a doleful, go-as-you-
please style of music. But Semiramide grieved
not, and it is said that as she gazed on the desic-
c ited mummy of her lord, shs said “ Thankgor he a
off, for in life he wasn’t fit to plug up rat
holes.” Shortly after this however, Umbertlus did
go out in his shirt at midnight’s silent hour, to pelt
bricks at sundry oats who were disturbing the
queen’s rest by their blarstid serenading, and he
caught a fatal cold and died from the painful*
effects thereof. At which the whole court (save
the queen), did laugh most oonsumedly, and it is
also recorded that Ninyas, the elder born, did hire
a portable electric battery and galvanise the dead
Umbertius, just, as he did say to his friends, to
see the sanguinary beggar squirm a trifle. But
Semiramide, the queen, was inconsolable, and put-
ting on sackcloth and ashes she publicly mourned
for Umbertius and refused to eat more than eight
meals a day, or drink less than seven tots ot the
Nubian drink called “ Whuskee." But Arbaces,
the High Priest of Belus, coming unto her said,
“ Why grievest thou so muchly for Umbertius, tor
when thy husband Minus lay dead thou didst hold
high revel in thy banquettlng halls and say to thy
friends ‘8et-em up agin old cocks; bere satyer.
And Semiramide making answer said, That s so ,
but then you must remember, Minus was not an
affectionate, or even a healthy nigger. A husband
is one thing, but a faithful servant Is quite a differ-
ent stylo of hairpin altogether.” Upon which Ar-
baces did feel constrained to go behind a pump
and kick himself with excessive laughter. (As a
classic story the above is good, but we fail to see
where it catches on to modern history.— Ed.B.)
Philippe D’Orleans, Comte de Paris, is now
45 years old. He was only four at his father s
death in ’43. He remembers his grandfather, Louis
Philippe, abdicating, and his mother taking him
and the Due de Chartres to the Chamber of Depu-
ties, only to escape therefrom at the peril of their
lives, his young brother being separated from
them in the confusion. In 1849 the Duchess came
to England to be near the King and Queen. The
King dying in 1850, the Comte went to Germany.
When in Sis twentieth year he lost his mother,
and the Due de Nemours was appointed his guar-
dian. After several years of European travel he
and his brother wont to America in 1861. volun-
teering on the Federal side, the two Princes were
attached to M’Clellan’s staff, both being present at
the battles of Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, and Game s
Hill. The Mexican expedition compelled their
return to Europe, a rupture between America ana
France being feared. On his return to Eng-
land he married his cousin Isabella, and from
that time until a law authorised the return of the
Princes to France, the young pair lived quietly at
Twickenham. At the period of the Prussian in-
vasion, the Comte was refused permission to fight
for his country. The Duo de Chartres, however,
engaged as a volunteer under a false name, and. as
!X g rtle Port distinguished himself. Since the
death of the Comte de Chambord, the Comte de
Paris has been acknowledged by the whole of the
Monarchical party as rightful heir to thethroneof
France; for no importance is to be attached to a
schism which the Comte d’Anbigne Is trying to
foment in favour of the Bourbons of Spain. By
his assumption of the name of Phiiippe. which
shows that he would reign as Philippe VII. and
not as Louis Philippe IL—as Roi de France,
and not as Roi des Francals — the Comte
de Paris has gained over the Legitimists.
He has lately discarded the use of razors, and trims
his beard like Henry IV. which gives him a singular
likeness to the portraits of the Roi Vert Galant.
Under the signature of Eugene Foroade, the
revue des Deux Mondes, of February, 1863, pub-
lished an article of his on the cotton crisis in Eng
land. He also published “ Les Associations
Ouvrieres en Angieterre” (Trades Unions). His
principal work Is “ La Guerre Civile en
in eight volumes. The Comtesse de Pans is her
husband’s first cousin, being the daughter of the
Due de Montpensler and an Infanta of Spain,.tall
and elegant, she possesses the marked features of
the Bourbons even in a stronger degree than her
husband. She is extremely domestic, an excellent
horsewoman, very fond of field sports, a good
shot, and excels in dancing. The children are four
in number. The eldest, Princesso Am41ie, was
born at Twickenham, 1866. The next, a son, Louis
Philippe Robert. Due d’OrlfSans, was also born at
Twickenham, 1869. Until the promulgation of the
Thlbaudin decree turning the Princes of Orleans
out of the army (a decree which the Comte de
Paris forestal'ed by previously resigning Ws
colonelcy in the Arm(e Territorlale), the young
Prince was being educated at the College Stanislas.
Since that edict he has worked with a tutor. The
third child is a girl of twelve, named Hritoe. The
baby, two years old, is the only one of the children
born in Frlnce. _

I have used your Acid Phosphate and can pro-

ful and beneficial in nervous dyspepsia, nervous*
depression following overwork and anxiety, as well
as the gastric derangements. Where there iff
venous stagnation and sluggish circulation, a dull*,

In regard to the Hereford's Acid Phosphate, I

I give it in dyspepsia and in all cases where there
is derangement of the liver and kidneys. With
my patients it has agreed wonderfully.

Horsford’s Acid Phosphate is a valuable medi-

from indigestion or innervation of the digestive
organs, and always with satisfactory results. It is
a good nerve tonic, and in some cases of morbid
urine, ‘ it acts like a charm,’ producing the desired
result. It is pleasant to the taste, acceptable to the >
stomach, and is, in my opinion, an excellent and *
valuable compound.”

Horsford’s Acid Phosphate, in elegance of com*-

in indigestion and urinary troubles. It forms an
excellent substitute for Lemon juice, and as such

An Eye for the Beautiful.
RAMBLING REFLECTIONS OF A NAUGHTY OLD MAN.
People may talk about the advantages ol
having “an eye for the beautiful,” and ail that
sort of thing, but for my part I think there’s nc
greater drawback to the happiness of a man wol
advanced in years than the possession of that
description of optic. For, you must understand,
I’m getting on a bit now—not that I feel It, because
my heart's just as young as ever it was; but stil
I am— there's no escaping from the melancholy
fact. Even If mirrors had never b«en invented,
and people made their toilets while standing over
a stream, like Narcissus, I believe I could distin-
guish quite enough of my reflection to realise that
ft was that cf an old ’un. It would have to be an
uncommonly muddy bit of water that made me
out anything else, you know. And, of course, the
same remarks hold good about Mary Anne, seeing
that we were both of an age when we married—
and that’s just where the trouble comes in. Having
an eye for the beautiful, you see, poor Mary Anne
doesn’t “fill” it in the manner she used to do; I
wish she did, for it’s awfully amusing for an old
fellow (not but what my heart’s as young as ever
It was) to find himself discontented with the missus
merely on account of his artistic sensibility, it
really is. An eye for the beautiful, somehow,
never seems to grow dim, at least mine doesn’t,
for although I’m getting uncommonly weak-
sighted in the matter of reading small print, I can
still see, beaming through the distance of some
fifty years, the bewitching face of Mary Anne on
her wedding day, so when I compare it with the
one opposite me at dinner, I get downright sad,
and feel a nasty gnawing pain at the heart, en-
tirely attributable to that organ being ‘‘as young
as.ever it was.” In fact I think it’s owing as much
to my youthful heart, as “the eye,” that I con-
tinue to take such a strange personal interest In a
pretty girl, at a period of life when I ought
(according to Mary Anne—not that I pay much
attention to what she says) to be thinking about
selecting a tombstone, we’re always quarrelling
on the subject, somehow. Perhaps, for in-
stance, we may be rldimr together in a “tram”
when a lovely girl will get in, too, (lovely
girls have a habit of go ting into trams, I always
think). Well, under such circumstances, it's only
natural that an old fellow (with an eye for the
beautiful) should take a fatherly pleasure in start-
ing a conversation with such an interesting object;
or, perhaps, if the vehicle’s overcrowded, suggest
“ an old man’s knee ” ns a safe and suitable resting
place. But you ought to see Mary Anne’s face on
these occasions, it’s less like what it was when I
married her than ever, and she won’t listen to
reason either. If I attempt to explain, after
wards, that the young and lovely bone of conten-
tion attracted my attention solely in consequence
of a striking resemblance to herself, at the same
age, Mary Anne merely calls me an “ old fool.” Or,
perhaps, she’ll say, “Stuff and nonsense, why, I
used to be as fair as a lily, and that little creature
was as brown as a gipsy.” There’s no pleasing
Mary Anne on such matters—women are so un-
reasonable. And that’s another thing, by the bye,
an old woman’s unreasonableness has nothing
“taking” about It. Now, I can remember that
when Mary Anne was first married there was
no prettier sight (to me, with my eye for
the beautiful) than M.A. in her “tantrums it
was quite a different spectacle to the old woman
when she's “ riled,” quite different, I can assure
you. My eye for the beautiful is getting a con-
stant source of irritation to me. in the domestic
circle; and though I do the best I can for it by
Insisting, positively Insisting, upon the engage-
ment of go id-looking housemaids, still I’m allowed
very few opportunities of appreciating their
beauty. No matter how much their lips remind
me of Mary Anne’s (when we were first married),
she never appears to understand my natural senti-
ments. When she caught me trying to snatch Just
one, she hurt my feelings dreadfully, ’pon ray
word, by calling me a slippery old sinner; for,
although, as already remarked, I don’t pay much
attention to what Mary Anne says, it isn’t nice to
be called names like that.
The Gtmpie Miner in discussing “ Mr.
Griffith and the Courier” advances to the height
of its great argument in excruciatingly high falutln
fustian. “In this Instance as in others, says the
G.M., “ he (Griffith) allowed his passions to outrun
his calmer reason (quite true), and has shattered
his high reputation Into brilliant fragments upon
the altar of his antagonism.” Hurrob I
A Wesleyan parson at Pyramid Hill (Vic.),
has been presented with a cheque for £30, to “enable
him to replace one of his horses that was acci-
dently killed a few weeks ago.” After that we
shall gratefully acknowledge any cheques that may
be sent along to enable us to “ replace ” our poets.
Every other week, on an average, there is one
“accidently killed’’ in this office—with a hammer.
A cheque for £30 will go a good long way in noets.
It strikes us as a pieeb of official stupidity
that a first class detective should be specially at-
tached to the General Post Office, and his salary
placed on the postal estimate, why could not a
detective or detectives be detailed from the Police
Force for postal service as occasionally required ?
In this way, there would be a possibility of the
needful police surveillance being performed with
a maximum of secrecy. The present arrange-
ment seems to have been devised to secure a
minimum of that article.
Thus a correspondent of the Daily News,
Writing from Trinkltat:—“ A spy was discovered
outside our camp lying on the sand. Although
only a boy of 15 years, he fought desperately when
surrounded. He was himself bayoneted, and Is
not expected to recover. His gallant behaviour
excited the admiration of the entire force. When
asked if he wanted anything, ho replied, ‘Let me
spear one Egyptian before I die.’ ’I his reminds us
of Sydney Smith, who when lying on his death-bed
In extreme prostration declared that ho felt so
feeble that were any one to lend him a knife ho
would scarcely be able to stick it into a dissenter.
We all know that “a bit of muslia ” has
always been peculiarly attractive when located on
a section of the anatomy of the living, but a cute
Yankee has struck the notion of working it in, in
connection with the dead. He lines graves with
it, making them look as cheerful as a damsel's
boudoir, and giving the corpse the idea that he’s
just rolling into a cosy bed. This is what we may
call mus-lln’ the very gloom of death—in fact,
quite taking the starch out of it; and proclaiming
at the very door of the sepulchre, “No mangling
done here to the tender hearts of relatives, or the
resthetic feelings of the corpse.” But enough—
though wo could write a grave yard of stuff over
this grave business.
This is how an indiscreet “ Capting ” of the
Salvation Harmy gave away his brethren in the
“swingle” the other day in one of our suburbs.
In the height of pious perspiration, he yelped:
“ Those who have gold will, I trust, be helped by
God to give it; those who have no gold, can give
silver; those who have no silver, can give copper;
and those who have nothing to give, can rise and
go.” Just so.—
If there’s gold within your purses,
And you would escape Hell's curses,
Plank It down;
Thus, though you In sin be hoary.
You can buy a pass to glory.
And Heaven’s crown.
If silver you only hold now,
And you’d slip into the fold now,
Plank it down;
Gold is great, but silver still will
Save you from a fierce God’s Ill-will,
And Christ’s frown.
If you’ve only heavy brass there,
Still there’s hone you’ll crib a pass there;
Plank it down;
Brass makes poor celestial fuel,
ttill, it may prevent you to Hell
Plunging down.
But if you hold naught of lucre
To give, with you it is euchre,
And your knell;
Hook it from our holy meeting.
And -not e’en the devil cheating—
Go to Hell I
Last week, at Cripps’s Inn, Parramatta,
some of the ceiling of the billiard-room fell on
one of the tables. This is how the local Fergy
treated the Incident. After waddling around the
bare fact, he asserts (d la Laurence Boythorn) that
The fallen plaster discloses as shameful a piece of
scoundrelly workmanship as ever was perpetrated
by the most rascally contractor on a confiding
employer, consisting as it does of 90 parts sand.
9 parts loam, 0*95 lime, and 0 05 hair. If there is any
law or justice can reach this latest example the
Australian working man, we sincerely truot Mr.
Crlpps will be able to sheet it home to him.”
There’s no doubt about i’ergy (when primed with
Cripps’s spiritus frumenti) being an admirable
judge of plaster, but why his comprehensive down
on the Australian working man ? One “scamping”
plasterer is n-j more to be taken as a sample of the
Australian working man than one bar-haunting
ink-slinger is to be regarded as typical of the Aus
1 ralian litterateur.
At Wellington (N.Z.), a young man em-
ployed as a clerk in a shipping ofilce parted his
hair in the middle, borrowed a dean dickey and
popped the question to a beautiful young lady,
the daughter of an old, respected, and middling
wealthy citizen of that town. The lady was
willing, the parents consented, and a day was
fixed for the splicing operation to be performed.
The clerk represented himself to be a man ot
means, had £11,000 cash to his credit in England,
besides several estates in landed property lelt him
by his father. It was necessary, he said, that he
should go to the old country immediately after the
marriage to get possession of the property, and he
proposed to take his bride with him. To enable
him to do this, he required his intended father-in-
law to endorse a bill for him for £400— just as a
matter of form, of course—but the old bird was
wary, and declined the snare. However, the
preparations for the marriage went on, the young
lady got all her boxes ready for the voyage, the
Jmung man himself put tickets on them, and then
eft her to take out their passages for London.
Next morning they were to bo married, and he
was to show up at a certain hour, and bring a
clergyman with him. A splendid wedding break-
fast was prepared, but neither bridegroom nor
clergyman came. Enquiries were made, and it was
found that no tickets for England had been taken
out. The clerk had been dismissed from his em-
ployment for some time, and it was ascertained
that he had disappeared from Wellington and gone
on board a ship which left the port on the evening
jrevlousto his intended marriage. He is now work-
ng his passage to the old country as assistant cook.
The young; lady, who has been lucky enough to
escape alliance with this contemptible scullion, is
to be congratulated. Let her cheer up, Shipping,
Insurance, Government, and bank clerks are more
numerous in Wellington than in any other citv in
the world with ten times the population. The
place actually swarms with them, but-here’s the
rub-it would take at least a baker’s dozen of them
to maintain one wife respectably. Consequently,
we would advise the young lady next time to look
out for a Journalist or a commission agent. We are
a journalist ourselves, wo have been a commission
agent, and we are still single, notwithstanding the
Slural way in which we write. This is leapyeai.
eed we say more, except that our address is at
the Bulletin Office, Sydney, and wo may add
that we just pine down to our boots for a father-
in-law whose name would be considered good in a
bill for £400,
“ Mr. Herbert Spencer has declined an in-
vitation to become a candidate for the representa-
tion of Leicester, on the ground that he could not
consent to become a mere delegate, and bis politi-
cal views being divergent from those of all
existing political parties, he could satisfy none of
them.” Now, we had thought better of Herbert.
Here is a man turned of three score—a learned
man, a man who has had the unparalleled firmness
to steer clear of matrimony, and the intellect tn
write a system of philosophy compared to which
the profoundest dissertations of Parkes or Mel-
ville are light reading—if they can be read -here,
we say, is a man of world-wide reputation,
staggered at an obstacle that would make Perry,
or Picton, or young Caulfield laugh themselves to
death to think of Mr Spencer cannot complain
of want of fair play in this paper, and we are sure
it is more in sorrow tha" in anger that we have to
plead with him, and when he that it is
only a few weeks ago since we gave him a whole
leader to himself, he will, perhaps, refrain from
throwing things around and kicking the cat when
ho sticks up this Bulletin in front of his coffee
cup, and roars to the cook to minimise the adum-
bration of that scrubbing brush, and c volve a silent
environment while he adapte l the external chop
to his internal relations, physically speak'ng, and
concentrated his perception on the toughest
journal of this age. He ‘ cannot consent to be-
come a mere delegate.” Think of that. Ste-

study, and cime out into the open air. How
is a man even to get into a place where he can
have a slap a,t his enemies under cover of privi-
lege, or get billet* for such of his sons as are crip-
pled or idiotic, or how is a man to get a bit of
land or do a tidy little thing in agencies by bounc-
ing out information in the Land’s Office— if he is
to be kept back by political opinions from taking
a seat ? No, let every man that loves his country,
whilst still retaining a sneaking regard for him-
self, get up in the Domain and spout temperance,
or turn alderman, then do a little bit of local
preaching, so as to have the electioneering going
on all the year round, and then let him listen to
the still small voice within, “Go to, thou art an
orator, thou canst saw the air with thy hand with
here and there a one—thou art profoundly igno-
rant of everything relating to Government, thou
hast no political opinions, and canst not even

AYER’S
Hair Vigor
restores, with the gloss and freshness of
youth, faded or gray hair to a natural, rich
brown color, or deep black, as may be desired.
By its use light or red hair may bo darkened,
thin hair thickened, and baldness often,
though not always, cured.
It checks falling of the hair, and stimu-
lates a weak and sickly growth to vigor. It
prevents and cures scurf and dandruff, and
heals nearly every disease peculiar to the
scalp. As a Ladies’ Hair Dressing, the
Vigor is unequalled ; It contains neither oil
nor dye, renders the hair soft, glossy, and
silken in appearance, and imparts a delicate,
agreeable, and lasting perfume.
Mr. C. P. Brigher writes from Kirby, O..
July 3,1882 : “ Last fall my hair commenced
falling out, and in a short time I became
nearly bald. I used part of a bottle of
Ayer’s Hair Vigor, which stopped the fall-
ing of the hair, and started a new growth. I
have now a full head of hair growing vigor-
ously, and am convinced that but for the
use of your preparation I should have been
entirely'bald.”
J. W. Boweit, proprietor of the McArthur
[Ohio) Enquirer, says : “Ayer’s Hair Vigor
is a most excellent preparation for the hair.
1 speak of it from my own experience. Its
use promotes the growth of new hair, and
makes it glossy and soft. The Vigor is also
a sure cure for dandruff. Not within my
knowledge has the preparation ever failed
to give entire satisfaction.” )
Mr. Angus Fairbairn, leader "of the
celebrated “ Fairbairn Family ” of Scottish
Vocalists, writes from Boston, Jifass., Feb, 6,
1880 : “ Ever since my hair began to give sil-
very evidence of the change which fleeting
time procureth, I have used Ayer’s Hair
Vigor, and so have been able to maintain
an appearance of youthfulness — a matter of
considerable consequence to ministers, ora-
tors, actors, and in fact every one who lives
in the eyes of the public.”
Mrs. O. A. Prescott, writing from 18 Elm
St., Charlestown, Mass., April 14, 1882, says :
“ Two years ago about two-thirds of my hair
came off. It thinned very rapidly, and I was
fast growing bald. On using Ayer’S Hair
Vigor the falling stopped and a new growth
commenced, and in about a month my head
was completely covered with short hair. It
has continued to grow, and is now as good as
before it fell. I regularly used but one bottle
of the Vigor, but now use it occasionally as
a dressing.”
We have hundreds of similar testimonials
to the efficacy of Ayer’s Hair Vigor. It
needs but a trial to convince the most skepti-
cal of its value.

RUNNING SORE
I had the misfortune of having my leg broken,
In front of William Sterns's dry-goods store, by a
case of goods being thrown on me. The bone was
sot by a physician of this place. Upon removing
the splints, sores broke out from my knee to the
heel, and several physicians called it varicose veins,
and ordered me to wear rubber stockings. After
wearing out about $35, worth of different makes
without any signs of any cure, I bought the Cuti-
cuka Remedies for the purpose, as 1 expressed it
at the time, to bo humbugged again. Before half
had been used I was astonished to see tho sores
heal up one by one, and now not one sore is to be
seen. I recommended tho same to a neighbouring
lady who had been troubled for years with a sore
wrist. After using hundreds of remedies she is
completely cured.

“ The other day, the Edinburgh Parochial Board
dismissed the chaplain of Craiglockhart Poor-
house, because he refused to preach eternal
punishment to the Inmates. The unfortunate man,
having a wife and family, and being dependent
upon nis own salary, formally recanted his ob-
noxious views, and ‘ solemnly promised to preach
and teach such simple Gospel truths as the manage-
ment may deem most suitable.’ He humbled him-
self in vain; he might have known that to forgive
a prostrate enemy is not in the nature of an austere
Presbyterian. He was sent about his business, in
spite of his fourteen years’ service. The salary
of the post is £130 a year, with apartments, coal,
and gas. There are forty-eight applicants for it,
including ten ministers, twelve missionaries, nine
teachers, eight divinity students, one gardener,
four small merchants, and one retired Major of
Dragoons.” — Exchange. Joolyeran I our con-
certina :—
They rise in righteous wrath, and from their door
“This faithless steward and his offspring spurneth,
Who will not preach to God’s afflicted poor
The wholesome prospect of the lake that burneth.
This recreant, hired to pour in pauper ears
A doctrine harsh of taste as salts and senna,
Who goes right back upon his trust, and cheers
Their hearts by saying there is no Gehenna.
This pastor, paid in Presbyterian gold
By stern-faced Scotchmen wearing black bell-
toppers,
So that the story may be strongly told
Of God’s sure vengeance upon palsied paupers;
This Shepherd of a starving flock, employed
To stand before Hope's door, a huge Goliath,
And tell them how His foes shall be destroyed,
And dwell upon the worm that never dieth;
This Chaplain, bribed with two-pound-ten a week
To teach sick vagrants duo respect to show to
The Board, then bid them turn the other cheek.
And tell them where they’re pretty sure to go to!
Who, understood to hold the views of Knox,
And fight Freethought in its minutest phases,
Turns round, and his employers’ feeling shocks
By having doubts about Eternal Blazes 1
This shuffler, found in house and gas and coal,
To be a stern, unpitying informant
Of mendicants, that the immortal soul,
Unsaved, is safe to feel immortal torment;
Who, daring to consider things himself,
Esteems the law of God’s own Book a bad law,
And puts His anger back upon the shelf,
And preaches sermons worthy Bright or Brad-
laugh]
This humbug, hid to preach that paupers must
Win Heavenly bread by Faith—as earthly by
work —
Then tolls, instead, of a Creator just,
Who doesn’t always go for “ hip and thigh
work;
This fraud, told off to paint the woe to come
To toothless beldames marshalled by the Beadle,
Who says the Saviour doesn’t make things burn
For souls in Hell, when once He gets * the
needlel”
They rise as one, this deeply-injured Board,
And cry “ Depart I ye are no more a watchman
Of souls for us, who misconstrue the Lord
As differing at heart from any Scotchman.
Whereto replies the trembling Chaplain, “I
Was wrong, but for the future they shall smell
Are
And brimstone—I will threaten all who die
In sin, with towering incandescent Hell-iire.
“ I may have given them hope—if it be so,
I’ll turn on the despair, if you should will it,

Nunquam Dormio.
Years ago, I was a burly bobby In the Melbourne

And I strictly did my duty. Through the prigging
And my catching of tho covey, I was made a

There’s a certain cricket ground that's in the
neighbourhood of town,
Where the gents, gets playin’ cricket to earn
money or renown.
They are dressed up all in flannel togs, and pads
tied on their legs,
And their coats and things they hang up in aroom,
on wooden pegs.
Borne improper party took to prigging purses from
their ooats,
Watches, rings, and pins, and money—copper,
silver, gold, or notes.
As they couldn’t nab the feller, they requested
that a “D.”

Bo they showed me to a room that held —a row of

seedy-looking legs. , .. ,
“ Gentlemen, there ain’t no sofa; where the deuce

If you don’t get one at once, 111 sling the blessed

Bo they got one, and I crawled beneath it; for my
artful plan . , . . ,
Was, if any chap come prigging, to jump out and
nail the man. ,, _ .
Then the players came and hung their coats and
other togs as well; ,
One, the latest, from his pocket took a flask and

Selina.
[A LEGEND OF “THE DRAPERY.”]
Selina was a charming maid,
Her eyes they glistened brightly,
Selina’s gowns were nicely made,
Her boots, too. fitted tightly,
The curls they clustered round her face,
Without the aid of papers;
She used to serve behind the lace,
At Silk and Stuff's, the drapers.
’Twas natural that one so neat,
So winsome, trim, and slender.
So nice about the hands and feet,
Should feel the passion tender;
Sheworshipped Kid (who “bought the gloves )—
A cheerful kind of chappie—
Till fortune frowned upon their loves,
They used to bo so. happy.
But fair Selina’s figure smart—
Those shining eyes, those tresses—
Played havoc,with the jealous heart
Of Jenkins (in the “dresses J;
He liked Selina best, you know.
Of all the girl “ assistants,
Though, as she had another beau,
He loved but nt a distance.
Yet, every day would Jenkins pray
(’Tis very sad, this story)
That ho might find a speedy way
Of sending Kid to glory;
He lay in wait, one evening, late,
For Kid, and fairly naboed him,
Then—rendered mad by jealous hate—
Ho (with his scissors) stabbed him.
Yes, stabbed him through, and left no clue
Which could excite suspicion.
Nor ever felt—’twixt us and you—
One pang of real contrition;
Though, when Selina wept and sighed,
Around her ho would hover—
KotnarkiDg (in a “ stage aside )
How much ho mourned her lover.
And many gentle sighs he’d drop—
His depth of woo revealing—
Till all the girls about the shop t>
Pronounced him full of fccuiw ,
He spoke of Kid with such concern
(While tears his vision blinded),
Selina's heart was bound to turn
To one so simple-minded.
When Kid was dead almost a year,
Selina’s smile was pleasant
If Jenkins whispered in her ear
Or bought a “ little present.
I For though, sometimes, her tears would start
At old, sad recollections.
Ho, somehow, healed her broken heart,
And won her young affections.
So, e’en upon the very day
That Kid had gone to glory,
Selina donned a garment gay
(We mvi ’twas sad—this story),
And went to church with faithful J ,
Which crowned their mutual blisses—
Oh! none so happy now, they say,
As Jenkins and his “missus.
(The moral of this is-“JJe sure your sin will find
you out.”)
INSENSIBILITY.
Justly Incensed Proprietress: “Ugh! ye provokin’ critters! I wonder ye’re not
ashamed to eat, and you not laying, with that placard staring you im the face all day.”
A Ballad of the Ballet.
Let us tell you in a hurry
That her name was Sarah Murray,
Though as Sally in this ballad she 11 be known,
And we hope she will excuse us,
For the freedom that we use is
Rather much for short acquaintance wo will own.
She was moving—we’ll not lure you
On until we reassure you
That this lay will burn and leave no moral ash,
(We are none of your John Bunyans)
In the sphere of steak and onions,
And the very highest circles of dry hash.
Yes, a waitress was our Sally,
Just a slave in the cook’s galley,
Much less redolent of roses than of stews :
True, she had romantic yearnings,
But it took most of her earnings
To keep her in striped stockings and in shoes.
Still, she had some small romances,
Made of giggles and of glances,
When the clerks sat down with weak pretence ot
phlegm.
While with ham-bones they did dally
They would ogle pretty Sally,
And pretty Sally she would ogle them.
And with each high-collared lisper
She would whisper still, and whisper,
While her curls across the butter-dish did droop :
Oh to hear their airy chaff then I
Oh to hear their lightsome laugh then !
As they spooned with her while spooning in tho
soup.
With their watch-chains hung with nickels,
How they patronised the pickles,
And chewed with condescension tho corned
beef 1
And their lips were wreathed with laughter,
Also cabbage, as they chaffed her
On the side they didn’t eat at—past belief!
How she did pass out and enter,
Undulating down the centre
Of the halls of dazzling hash, amid the talk,
With a smile that seemed eternal,
Just as in tho London Journal
All the duchesses invariably walk.
But when she a poor reporter
Saw. who hadn’t time to court her,
Hiding furtively his shillingsworth of beef,
She would crush him with proud glances,
Like tho countess in romances
Smiling icy scorn upon the burglar-chief.
She made captive all affections
By awaking recollections
Of the past—the very dress that she had on,
The neat gown that did enrobe her,
Like the dame’s in Gustave Flaubert,
Was a chronicle of dinners dead and gone.
And to one with any feeling
There was that in her appealing
To the soul—for just to see her was a meal I
And, indeed, it was our duty
To say Sally was a beauty,
Though her charms too oft were seen behind a
veal.
But when the clerks had quitted.
The corned-beef brigade had llitted,
Leaving only wrecks of “ tucker ” in the halls,
She stood a lonely figure—
Not unlike Macauloy’s nigger
A-surveying of the ruins of St. Paul’s.
Then her own small dinner after,
With the others, and their laughter
At our Sally lor her aspirations high I
And some told their little passions,
Some were deep in plates of fashions,
And others deeper still in plates of pie.
But—oh hang it, this is weary !—
(There are times ev’n we are dreary)
Let us say she dreamt of ballerinas’ luck ;
And, the matter not to mince too,
She would wed a Russian prince too,
Just like them, to bo her own muscovy duck.
Well, she went into the ballet,
Did our sentimental Sally,
And she got a pound a week, or thereabout—
But she found no one to court her,
Save an amorous light-porter.
But Sally had a preference for stout.
Have we heard aught of her since then ?
Did she wed a Russian prince then ?
She did not—she wed a skittle-ahey sharp
Whoso hands with rings were blazing
In a manner most amazing—
Hand us now the No. 7 woeful harp.
Oh, a curse upon the ballet,
And alas for silly Sally,
For her husband drew her cheque, which he did
smash
Ev’ry pay-night in strong liquor,
And would then come homo and kick her—
Oh, romantic girls take warning— stick to hash.
